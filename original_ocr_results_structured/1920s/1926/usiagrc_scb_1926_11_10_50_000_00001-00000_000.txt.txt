upsets—the element or uncertainty
that makes the g idirori sport so popur
lar with the Innsifedhlred last Satur—
day's liissouri Valley football card,
with the result that the conference
race takes on a different aspect this
week, and the probable outcome is
farther than ever from a preseason
conclusion.

(Two of the teams, which last week
loomed unbeatable, this week
tasting the aftermath of defeat, and
one of them, Concl’Gll'llln Henry's
Missourians, is definitely out of the
championship finals - a result of tile
10 to 7 drubbing at the hands of Ok~
lalioina. The other club, the Kansas
.Aggies, rated an a par with hlissouri.

All other] games resulted as predict—
-ed, but by far larger scores than airy
' sport expert dared to dope. Crinnell
wallopcd the loivly Jay-hawks, 32 to

up a score on Washington that looked
like a Brookhart plurality, and made
the Bears anxious to demand a re-
count. The final result was 37 to 3.

Three teams now remain nndefei-llr
ed, Kansas Aggies, Oklahoma Aggies
and Gl‘lnnell, but the latter's record is
marred by a tie game with Amos.
Each has won two Valley games, but
Grinoell is the only school to remain

undefeated throughout her entire
schedule, a fact which makes no (life
ference in the percentage column, ex
cept that which dopsters read into
it. .

The defeat of the Aggies, while haw
ing no bearing on the race, does add
prestige to Grinnell's record. How-
ever, in justice to Bacbman’s crew,
let it be said that the Wildcats prob-
ably had this Week’s tussle with Ne—
braska on their minds, and were wary
about showing their stuff before Huse
ker scouts until it was too late, with
the result that the Kansas farmers
were caught napping and suffered the
double disappointment of giving away
their plays and losing the game.

huggies have Chance

If the Kansas Aggies are able to top
the Nebraska hurdle Saturday which
hardly seems likely in view of the
ability of the Cornhuskers to pack
footballs, they will have the best
chance of cupping the flag, for they
will have only Ames, already low in
standings, to defeat. And should Grim
nell also come through her next two
games undetected, she would tie in the
percentage column with the Aggies,
but would have little claim on the
title because of the one tie game.

Washington Wins 0.

Grinnolls freshman team went
down before the powerful frosh eleven
of Washington university 42-0 at St.
Louis Saturday. Dutwelghcd over
twenty pounds to the man, the rice
neei- yearlings were outclassed from
whistle to gun.

while the Grinnell team was entirely
made up of men of freshman standing.
the Washington team consisted largely
of men who had played considerable
college football but who were ineligr
ible for varsity competition because of
having changed schools. Schlbe,
Shimmers and Cornstock, all formerly
of Michigan, came under this class.
Also there were two men from West
Virginia Wesleyan and one from Mis~
soiirl. As far as is known, the rest
of the team were freshmen

Punting was the one department of
the game in which Grinnell held an
advantage over their opponents. Mc-
Intire’s kicks gained at least ten yards
for the young Pioneers on each ex
change.

For Washington Harthett and Biokel

may be obtained from members of the
play production classes. There will
be no reserved seats; the admission is
fifty cents.

The three plays include a variety
of entertainment. In "Riders to the
Sea”’the scene is laid on the Arau
islands off the coast of Ireland, remote
from civilization in both time and
place. The men of the community
live by the sea and in the play 'the
centralhgure is the old lrish mother.
She has been deprived by the sea of
father, husband, and several sons.
W'llell the play opens, the body of her
favorite son, Michael, has been found
but the two daughters keep the news
from her in the hope of breaking it to
her gently.

. Exceptional Aclilip:

Her only remaining son, riding to
the sea to embark for thc mainland,
meets his death and so the old woman
receives the last blow which the seat
can give her. Such a story requires
exceptional acting to convey the tie
iuendons emotional content without
making the play melodramatic.

Deaths occur in the second play, but
there is no sense of fate or tragedy.
iBeing an erie ghost story, it is meloe
‘dramatic and more in the nature of
a thrilling mystery play. Two Amor—
icans, former soldiers, touring thrii
devastated France, are compelled to
seek shelter in a deserted old French
chateau.

The sole occupant of the place is a
prematurely aged valet who lives un-
der the hallucination that the spirit
of his master, who had been murdered
during the war by the Germans, in-
hahits the building with him. The
master, the "lion without a head” is

Sport Scribes Eulogize Excellent

The following item is clipped from
this week's "dope bucket“ column of
thc vankton student, a weekly paper.
The column is edited by H, A. Itohin-

article is headed “Griunell—An Ideal."

Sec Taylor, sports editor of the Des
lIoines Register and head lincsman at
the Kansas game Saturday, made this
comment:

"Grinnell defense stopped the home
team dead. The Pioneers wall, led
by Captain Martin who played a 1'0-
markable game, one that stamps him
as one the the greatest tackles in the
Missouri valley conference, was the
vulnerable to all attacks and the alert

the Kansas passes were intercepted by
the Pioneers.

MARTIN AND MEETER STAR

ll) lilntl Eleven Surprises Followers in

Ill Decisilrc Fashion.

(By the Sports editor, Daily Kunsiui)

When the Kansas football fans saw
the Kansas Aggie team in action they
thought that they were seeing a per-
fect football machine. A week later the
Net .i Cornhuskers came along
and looked a little better than the Ag—
Saturday the Crinhcll Plo—
noers, a team which hithertofore had
not created much disturbance in the
Valley, came along and looked better
than any of the dehdwker’s oppo—
nents thus far this season when they
defeated Kansas by a score of 32 to
7.

What a battle the pioneers put up.
From the start until the final minute
of play the Iowans were in there fight-
ing ,iIeeter's fine playing dominated
the hacklreld's exhibition while Capi
tain Martin and Rlnefol't were the
mainstays of the Gl'lrlnell line. But
the mention of those three men does
not include all of the Pioneer men who
sta ed. A list of these stars would re-
quire the mentioning of ncai 3 all of
the northern school's players.

Sco s unusually Large.

Only two other valley schools have
ever smothered Kansas by such a tops
heavy score. Oklahoma and Nebraska
were the teams to accomplish this
feat. Washburn has also defeated
Kansas by a wide margin but they
were not in the valley when this feat
was accomplished.

The lone touchdown for the Jaye
hawkers canoe in the third quarter on
a pass, Zuher to Baker, for 24 yards.
Wall was inserted into the fray and
made the kick good for the extra
point, This was about the only time
in the game that Kansas fans had a
chance to show any enthusiasm and
they really did. If applause indicates
appreciation the Jayhawk followers
certainly appreciate it when their
team makes a touchdown.

Hidden Ball Trick Used.

Grinnell brought their famous hid-
den ball trick into play on several oc<
casions and it was usually good for a
substantial gain. This play is an imi»
tation of the famous Pennsylvania
hidden hall play. However, it looked
like the real thing to Kansas and not
an imitation.

In only one department or the game
did Kansas excel Grinnell and that
was in the puuting, zuber's punts
were usually good for more than forty
yards and several of them approached
the 55 yard mark. uleetcr's panting
was erratic. Some of his kicks went
only 1.) yards while one of them elud-
ed the Kansas safety and went for the
long distance of 75 yards. However.
his inconsistent piinting was offset by
the kickoffs that he made. which were
always 55 yards or more.

Game is slow.

All endless flock of substitutions by
both sides during the fourth quarter
slowed up the game considerably,
Few citing plays were executed by
either side and when one was made
it was usually by the Criiincll eleven.

Griunell still maintains their per—
fect record for the season's competi.
tion. With only the Oklahoma Aggie:
and the Drake Bulldogs left on their
valley schedule it looks very much as
though they would go through the sea—
son and win or tie for first place in
the valley. Since Oklahoma defeated
Missouri and the Kansas hggies must
play Nebraska, the Pionccrs have an
excellent chance to cop the valley
bunting. Comparative scores between
the l :iique-ttc games give Grinnell
a considerable edge over the Kansas
. cries

gie team.
