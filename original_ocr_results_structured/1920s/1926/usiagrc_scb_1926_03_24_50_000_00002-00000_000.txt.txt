GILL-YNELL — THE L. A. SPECIALIST

In line with“ the movement to get more men at
Grinnell, should come the realization that belief
Liberal Arts is belief in this college.

in
Grinnell students who go home spring vacation
should remember, while talking to prospective students
abollt the merits of this institution, that the names
Grinnell and Liberal Arts are nearly synonymous.

A man should take liberal arts at a. college which
specializes in Liberal Arts. That Grinnell does. There
is one active instructor for Every ten students here,
the smallest ratio that can he found in Iowa; this ad-
vantage is further increased by small classes and direct
Contact With full-time protessors, many of whom have
their rh. D. degrees.

Those who feel that the fifty-dollar raise in tuition
was unwarranted need ‘to know that other Harvard Ex-
Knox, Eeloit and Carleton,
raised their tuition several yEars ago. College students
must pay proportionately for the educational advantag-

es they get, and if Grinnell is to maintain the Harvard
Exchange standard $250 is not too much.

It is unwise to be blind to Grinnell's defects but it is
not immodesty to be aware of her distinct and peculiar
advantages. Thee'e is no reason Why a. Grinnell man
should not be proud of presenting these merits to pros-
pective students. False publicity should be ‘taboo, but
like business concerns colleges do a certain service by
calling attention to the goods they have to offer.

week-end through the medium of Art.
an organization cultural in itselt, is bringing a collection
of Medi ' prints, the property of the American Federar
tion of Art, here lor an exhibit.

It will payus to expend a little time and energy at

this art exhibit upon individual and collective self-exam-
ination, and we ‘take the liberty of suggesting a single
point for consideration: our failure to interest ourselves
in the thought of‘ others, insofar as that thought is ex-
pressed in Art. Are we curious? We certainly are, or
we certainly are noniwhichever way We may wish to
read the meaning of that word. We are curious because
we have no curiosity, and to have no curiosity in mat—
ters of culture is a thing ot which we should be heartily
ashamed.
Man has always been industrious because of neces-
sity, but when a man becomes an artist, he does so
through choice. All art is the product of human activity,
but of an, activity which is not driven by force of imme-
diate need, but the desire of which is to arouse an emo~
tion, a. feeling of admiration, pleasure. horror, at least
curiosity.

Art is not only a luxury and a diversion, but the
complement oi the desire for life itself. it has been call-
a social phenomenon, for its purpose is to find a response
in others, and no civilization, however crude, has com—
pletely ignored it. Art can translate the daily aspirations
of man towards that which is lacking in everyday life,—
those elements which our sensibilities crave and which
no mere utilitarian progress can supplant .

A number of customs and super-
stitions of interest to foreigners clns~
ter about the old city of 'recbow. It
was on our first trip from the rail»
road station to the Mission Compound
that we ran on in the first or tbeser
a gnarled old locust tree decorated
with numerous red rags varying in
shade and number of tatters in direct
proportion to the length of time they
had hung there. And in answer to
our question we were told: "Not a
clothes-line; a prayer-tree. Since the
power of speech was returned to a
dumb man who drank some water
cense at its base, offered prayers, and
left pieces of red cloth fastened to
the branches as a sign of their de-
votlbn.“

About the time that the Techow city
will was built, some six hundred
years ago, there lived in the city a
famous scholar. when a huge rock
appeared over-night in a Iield south-
east Of Techow, he declared it to be
a fallen meteor and the deep well
which was discovered nearby to be a.
symbol from the God of Rain. Soon
after the death of the scholar the
city magistrate caused a temple (name
ed Wen Ch'ang, in honor of the God
of Writing) to be erected over the
road leading from Techow to the
Black Dragon Wen—the name given
to the well because of the color of the
Water in it and from the fact that s.
spirit must have sent it, To this day,
Whenever there is an especially dry
season in this region, the magistrate
rides out through the Wen Ch'ang arch

and warships the Rain God at the
Black Dragon Well.

Not far from the Wen Ch’ang Arch,
and just before we arrived at the Mis-
sion Compound, we passed an inter-
esting old temple which is called “The
Medicine King Temple." Under the
yellow roof of the main building of
this temple is a plaster figure repre-
sen'ting the iirst man, who is said to
have lived more than five thousand
years ago. In 1900 the Boxers are
said to have occupied this temple; on
the second day of lighting the sol-
diers who opposed them were discov—
ered standing in a fighting position
along the city wall, but with their
heads severed from their bodies, as if
a knife had been hurled through the
air by some mysterious force! Such
are the tales associated with some of
the temples.

~ Many times as we pass this temple
on the way into the city, we meet
funeral processions headed by the
musicians who wear long green coats,
and followed by the cataialque with
its gorgeously embroidered scarlet
covering. In these processions we al-
most invariably see 'tbe paper images
of material things which have sur-
rounded tbe deceased while still in the
world. We are reminded then or the
little shop We so often pass on the
street where these gaudy tissue»pa-
per likenesses or people, animals,
houses, ctc.,are made. Funerals and
weddings in China are always inter-
esting to an American because of
their unique customs.

We were on the lookout from the
lirst for strange customs. We found
some or ‘the most interesting of these
in the long coat ikc garment which
the men wore, the short garment
worn by women, the bound feel. of the

women and the cloth shoes worn by ‘

both sexes. It is strictly fashionable
for small girls ‘to Wear their hair
braided in at least three "pigtals.’
Bright colored yarn is often twisted
into the braid, Peking beauty shops
dictating a different colored yarn for
each braid. If one dares to jump from

sentence, we might add that we were
impressed by the great stretches of
yellowJJrown land, the clusters of
