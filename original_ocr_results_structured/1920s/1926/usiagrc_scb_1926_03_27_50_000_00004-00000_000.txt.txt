“Our greatest need is for one iii-
ternational language," said llr. S.
Colomh Giinllau in his chapel talk
on international languagennd Esper»
auto in particular, Tliursdny. Our
contacts with actions are e\er widen-
ing and we must have a conrinoir mode
ium oi speech.

In the time oi King Tut-llnkhranlen,
Babylonian was the international dip-
lomatic language, Later it was sues
ceeded by Greek, and in the Middle
Ages Latin became the commonest
tongue. Science and mathematics
have their universal shorthand and
ships have signals which practically
all or them can understand.

“French, German and English are
sutlicieirtly universal that a person
who knows all three can make most
of the international contracts he
would like to," Mr. Gil Fillan continuv
ed, hut is very ditilcult to master all
three perfectly. There are iir these
languages dialectic variations that
form the basis for Esperanto, and
which make the learning or this new
international language much easier.

"Esperanto is a composite photo-
graph ct the principal European lang-
uages, in which thosc leatures come
out which are common to most all of
these tongues," he said. The gram-
nrar is so simple that it can he pr t—
ed on a postal card. It starts with
international roots, and a thousand
words is enough tor ordinary uses
since from this can he made 100,000
with ease. The spelling is phoneti
one sound to a letter. “All rtalian dele-
gate to an international nfflcial cone
gross at Venice on Tourism, which

started learning it on the train. AI-
iired there he {mind he could make
Speeches Ill it. . . I had to study it six
weeks train a hook."

Rev. Bosworth Talks
At Last “Y” Meeting

The Reverend E. F. Bosworth, new:
ly installed pastor or the Cougrcga—
tioncl church, spoke Thursday night
at the last meeting or the Y. M. c. A.
or the year before the ircw ciliccrs
take charge. His topic was mainly
concerned with how to live a con
tiztn lire

“Haw shall I live a Christian life?”
asked Reverend Doswol'tli, and he
continued to develop his speech along
this line. Too many of us are apt to
segregate the spiritual lite li-om busi-
ness lire believing that that the two
are not inscparahlc. However. this
is impossible for the two go hand in
hand, and we can only be successful
it the two are lived in close conneer
tion. ,

The question has stared every sucr
ceeding generation in the race or how
to live a Christian life and every gen—
eration has attacked it in a diiterent
manner. The sanrc proposition is
put up to the present one and through
our selentliic knowledge, the results
or generations past, we should attltck
and solve the problem from that
standpoint.
