Grinnell is to hear Esther Dale, so-
prano, world renowned as “America‘s
only lieder singer," next Friday eve-
ning. December 10, in Herrick chapel.

Her loi-ely voice, ncr great artistry,
combined with a rare intelligence has
inspired both critics and audiences
here and abroad to the use of the
siiperlaiives. The connuent or the
Los Angeles Times on her Hollywood
b‘owl concert sums up recent Amcr~
ican opinion: “Miss Dale has estab
lished hersell in the minds or all her
listeners as a singer with a voice or
lovely quality and the mental equip»
meiit necessary to an artist of the
first rank. Her siiiipli ty and grac-
iousness or manner was a matter or
pride for every American-born music-
1 -er in the audience." A Vienna
newspaper sums up her an ties in
the lollowing: “Her voice is big and
vigorous. ,et sweet and mellow and
wonderfully l'icll. Her interpretations
are flawless."

Miss Dale‘s program is: .

Convention of “Presser-s” Leaves

“Uplift” Effect Upon Their Hosts

The “l’l'essers” have come aiidgonc
~flic "uplilt" at their presences is
general on the campus. They have
more than proved their journalistic
inclinations. Each day most of them
wrote sullletllillgicvcll it it was only
a letter home. or to Jack, or Jill, and
our stationcr shows a marked de
crease; but he c g tellllievcr so—
how else could we ever have used up
that awlui pink gin box that the
maiden aunt ben‘ignly bestowed upon
us last Christmas? ‘

Further proor: Did you notice how
eagerly the s. 8: 13‘s. were awaited
Saturday night? Next year's co—eds
lust literally seized upon them. We
have never seen such enthusiasm for
the proicssion. Hundreds of this
jewel in our journalistic crown were
used for curl papers, to wrap what-
nots, to fill up space in rattling suite
cases. and as irrefutable evidence that
thc ”Presser" had been to Gi-innell
and prolited thereby.

Yes. they're come and gone through
everything we had. We, hope "all:
pri aic lives and letters will be a
matter or lusp shop to our young
lvoilldelle imitntc (Gosh! We hope,
they're nerci- worse than we
arci. Some oi us are holding oin-

any

breath lest some all our correspond.-
ancc appear in next sunda 3 paper
in the “True Love Letters" column,
But on the other hand, that's just zine
other ficld of journalism.

indeed, the advent or these young
enthusiasts has left indelible traces
upon us, with shame we accept the
condemnation in such a remark as
“Geei Don’t you have anything to
read?" ivhcn we could only point out
bookshelves with such stiiii as Shake-
speare, story of Philosllhy, Jean
('hl‘islophc. and The Opera 1300!: in

ed, they might have found our Bell

or our Gothic dining room, pride
and Joy of oiiigsoiils, we have had a
hit or unusual criticism. Our proud
table head pointed out the vast ceile

ed and siihdiied tones to call lorth the
response, “Oh, that's nll right. I've
eaten in lots worse places than tllis.‘
As a punishment For our hurt feel-
illgs, we hope she has to eat there [or

Two linoleum cuts by Deane w.
Sturrctt feature file Jaulllll') Tanager
which made its appearance on the
campus this week. The cuts, both or
which are appropriate lor the holiday
s 'lsoll, fit in» excellently with the
Christmas idea that is carried out inl
so many publications at this time ol
the year,

The leading article of the January
issue is “Sister Aimee,",written fol"
the Tanager by Arthur Mom-e. In this;
sketch, M . Moore reveals the rise of
Aimee McPherson trom a vagabond to“
a successful evangelist with assets of
over six- hundied thousand and dis-
cusses the psychology of her evangeb
ism as well as the relative credence
which it is well to attribute to her re~L
cent kidnapping.

Brollli‘lllil't Discus ,ll

January's number does not slight the
Iowa celebrity, however. The home-
state Mussolini is ably deiended as
the "Duce of Iowa Politics." the
spokesman of a peasantry cursed with
an iniei-iority complex,
Hicks.

Poetry in the January number is
contributed by George Steele Seymour
and Miriam McNally. Mr Seymour,
who is the author of “Adventures
Among Books and Autographs," and
the founder oi the Order of Buukfel-
lows, has contributed two pages or
child—like poetry to the current issue.
M s hlcNally's short poem is entitled,
"A Birch‘iu Autumn."

(‘olllllll‘nt Oil Lindsay’s Works

An interesting discussion of Vachei
Lindsay. and the popularity of that
Poet’s works among recitalists has
been contributed by John Kearns, lib
erary editoriot the Jacksonville (1111-
no .> Daily Journal. Two short stor-
ies by Margaret Weishaar and Mildred
Onstinc make up the balance of the
issue. There are also two interesting
essays on "Modern Theosophy," by
Joseph McKee, and a "Note on Typo-
graphy," by Wayne Gard.

The conversation was stopped by a
knock on the door, and the girls cdll~

he closed the door Gloria whispered
that be was ina's llance.

it was impossible to accommodate

“Are you in the habit of seeing col-
