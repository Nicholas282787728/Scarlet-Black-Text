After Carefully studying the manuscript, the Scallol
and Black editors offer the logical paraphrase to the letter
submitted by Two Grinnellinns. Thé’ What DO You
Think contribution Contains fourteen questions which
may some (l1 ' achiere the fame of Wilson’s Fourteen
Points. This is will“. two Griilnellians would have you
helicvc:

linido llnpo on the Students:

Grlnllell students are llaeitists. Although paciﬁsis.
they fight. They stir up Str e through the Scarlet and
Black to force their opinions upon neighboring religions
colleges.

President Coolidge is infallible. Gl‘innell students

\Vllen . lent Cul‘ lilierrcd that the United States could
have no nrliiy lilld navy without colllpulsoi-r military
lrnining in colleges, Grillncll students And faculty failed
to take action in the nintter. This is another bad sign.
ilol's oi’ the Scarlet And Black ignore the Bible,
’l‘ire Gl‘illnclliilns would hnic aou hclicre. Christian
principles oi’ the Bible tench nations to null themselves:
hut according to the Grinllcllians, the editors have not

years ago there was t iol‘tll in the Scripture all the
linol»'le(lgt\ or art, religion, philosophy, college mun-
agenlent, military training alid compulsory chapel, the
world will ever nrcd. Like Coolidge, the Bible is an
lnizlllihle source at all such knowledge.

More Juicy nits!

Cl'illnell students lleliere thelllseh es Wiser than Corr
llcll college trustoco So radical are the editors or the
Scarlet and Black, that should students he donieu any
liberty they tern‘l fundamental, it is entirely possible the
Scarlet and Black would urge some slight demonstration
on lilo part of students.

Abolition of all authority is advocated by Grinnell
Students. Contrarll , Cornell college students enjOY
faculty Control as . illited in the s’ystelli at compulsory
chapel and the hall on dances, It is a \i‘DntlprIul (Ils-
pllly of puritdnisnl, the highest ideal of mankind.

Chaos is the alternative to puritanisln. Grinnell stu-
dents like Cl‘lﬂDS. They have undoubtedly achieI Ctl chaos
on the Grinnell campus. Strangely enough, the chaotic
situation of the college has given Grinnell fame from
coast to coast and the institution has endeared itself to the
hearts of its students

Students oi Grinllell college (larC compare their alum

And now, after reading this, if you have a Whit of

Dear SI
On September 2, 19'26, an editorial
was published, c ti nga "neighbor
in; l-elig us college," for i-cuuiriug
Bible study and military training. Is
it consistent ’with G nnell's pucilist
policy to stir up striic with (‘09, which
advertises as the only nonrstate con-
trolled college in Iowa to have mili-
tary training" no G nncll students
think themselves Wiser in Illattels at
national defense than Pl'csidentcoolg
idge, himself an advocate oI disarm-1
merit and otllel'vxiellee policies, who
said in his annual message, “No Sillf-‘
r Sheeting nation would neglect to
provide an army and naly proportionK
ate to its population, the extent oi its‘
territory, and the dignity oi the place
‘ which it occupies in the world"? Docs

Grinnell students think that, in these
(lays when wars are decided within a
