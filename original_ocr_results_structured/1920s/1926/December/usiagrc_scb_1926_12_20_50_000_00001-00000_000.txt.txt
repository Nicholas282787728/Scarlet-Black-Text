NEAR EAST WANTS PEACE

Attitude of Greek Government Toward
American Schools Allll Mend?
Hits Been Friendly.

Establishment oi schools in the
Near East: is pioneer work, said Dr.
George E. White, '82, president oi
Anatolia college, Salonika, in a leer
ture given here Thursday evening, Dr.
White speaking on “Near East Poli-
tics Through a College Window," (lea
voted some time to describing the
schools which have been iounded in
the Near East as well as political cone
ditions there, >

Dr. and Mrs. White established their
first college at Marsovan in Asia
Minor thirty-six years ago. "here in
the heart at the Turkish empire their
college grew, first with Armenian
students, then Creeks. then Russians
and finally Tur Everything went
well until loll when the Turks turn-
ed against the Christians. Then fol—
lowed what Dr. White termed as “the
greatest movement oi population in
history," when one million iive bun-
dred thousand Greeks and Armenians
leit Turkish territory and went to
Greece and Macedonia as a result oi
Turkish attacks.

School l-Iits I’l'omesseli

In December three years ago a new
school was started at Saloniku to r -
place the one at Marsovan. 01d build
ings have been bought and rebuilt,
new land acquired, and new buildings
erected, so that the work oi the cola
lege may go on.

The League ol Nations has played
an important part in the Near East
and through its iniluence Greeks have
been removed irom Turkish territory
and—from Bulgaria to their native
country. Turks and 'Bulgarians who
were living in Greece have also been
removed to their native lands. As
Jugo-Slavia and Bulgaria both have
Salonika as a sea port, better rela-
tions are iostered,

Greek Attitude Friendly

The attitude of the Greek govern-
ment toward the American school and
it heads has always been iricndly, al»
though Dr. White described the gov
ernment as “sometimes experiencing
revolutions instead or elections," Dr,
mute described Russia as a big bear
looking over on the territory around
the Black Sea and Constantinople, but
saidthat there would he no real dang-
er ior some time.

The people or the Near East do not
want war, but they want peace with
ther‘comforts of lite and chances ior
advancement which it brings, and Dr.
Whitehas hope that conditions in this
particular part oi the country will
become better.

This season's Grinneii basketball
team will find a considerable amount
oi beef in its ranks. With the addi-
tion oi “Tiny” Rinefart to the sound,
the team average has increased many

lads. l-laycs brings with him to
Grinneii, a theory embodying speed
and weight, two factors that are hard
to overcome by any team, providing
there is mental alertness.

Lise ’Erllsll Material

Two or perhaps three winners of
last season are being displaced by
newer material with the accession of
the fresh material from last year‘s
squad. and the other new members of
the squad who are reporting this
year.

coggeshall, one of the stellar Der»
formers on Charley Black's freshman
outfit or last winter, will be holding
down a forward in tonight‘s tilt.
Goggle has been showing fine form
since the opening of the cage season,
and a brilliant year is predicted for
this ‘olmgslel' iindcr Coach Hayes'
tutelage.

At the other iorwal-d will he Chase,
veteran of two years experience, and
one of the clever-est floor men to ever
play on. a Grinneii teal-a. Chase has
been taking care of his end of the
basket tossing in line shape during
the practice sessiolls.

Rlueiort Improves

A new race will be seen at center,
where “Moco” Itinefort will perform.
Rinetort, who stands well over six
feet and weighs more than anyone else
on the Fioneer squad, is a good jump-
er, and to show that he’knows what
the game is all about, lapped some-
thing over ten baskets in a practice
game the other evening.

The guard positions will be handled
by Davis, veteran oi last year's team,
and Fail, captain of the rrosh aggre-
gation or last season. Fall is a clev-
er player, ahd knows the game thor-
oughly. He is a very aggressive guard
who rarely allows a man to get by
him for a short shot,

In the line of substitutes Hayes will
be well supplied during the season in
the matter of experienced men with
Doifmg, Niblo, Peterson, Lamb, and
Mark as letter winners ready to slip
ilito the lineup at any time,
