starting with a poppy chapel s
vise at nine in the morning and last-
ing through a suakc dancc, matinee,
dance, and a huge bonfire at night.
.Grinucll's first "victory day" celebl'nr
tion marked .\ fitting end to the foot-
ball careers of ll Pioneer grid stars
and a list of victories over the strong-
est teams in the Missouri vallcy,
marred by a single defeat by Oklaho-
ma A. at M. The enthusiasm stored
up over Thanksgiving vacation by the
in t victory of the Pioneers over
Drake university in seven years was
allowed free reign,

"Prcx " Main was the official
starter of the ceremonies when he
told the assembled students at chapel
the purpose of the day. He said that
it was not a traditional 'fluuk day' as
some believed, but that it was a day
of celebration set aside to fete the
football men for their successful sca-
soh nd more especially their defeat
of Drake. Elmer Chase thanked the
faculty for their cooperation in mak-
ing the day possible and read the list
of activities planned for the day and
evening.

r of Pioneer Triumph

Cordon Mccter, Pionecr back-
hcld star, again booted two placc
kicks, and “Hilghie” McLain repeated
his sensational run of thirty-five
yards for a touchdown after receiving
a pass from Lamb.

Superstition and tradition ruled af-
ter the game when Mike Hyland con.
ducted the annual shoe burning cere-
moncy with each senior varsity
iuan making a touchdown and kicking
a goal. The eleven seniors marched
off the ﬁeld as the crowd sang "Sons
of Old Grinnell," and Captain Porter
Mai-tin threw the bui ing shoe over
the goal posts to officially end the
traditional closing of the football sca-
scn. Hcrctoforc tiic shoe burning was
held after the final practice of the
season and right before the last game
with only var ty and freshman grid-
dcrs witnessing it. Whether the posts
pollement till after the last ganic was
the cause of Gi-innell's sensational
victory over the Bulldogs, as some
suggest, remains to be seen.

The great college sport of crashing

high school games played on Ward

Theatre in the afternoon. An added

what it meant to play une's last game
for Grinnell. He told of the sorrow
of eleven senior varsity men after
their triumph Thanksgiving day in
Drake stadium, as they realized they
would put away their suits for-ever,
Tire optimism and Pioneer spirit was
exemplified as Captain Martin dwelt
on the prospects for the team of 1027.
Although they may look rather doubt-
ful at this early date, he expressed
the confidence that they would again
be near the top in the Valley percent-
age column.

Raymond Nibln, allrMissoul‘i Valley

in smashing through the Drake
Bulldogs for ten points in the first two
periods of the Thanksgiving day game
at Des Moines. Coach Mike Hylsnd's
Pioneers piled up a large enough
lead to put the game on ice, and
marked the breaking of a jinx of sev—
cu years standing. Three more points
werc'addcd to Crinncll's quota in the
final pcriod to convince the blue-suit»
ed team that there was to be nothing
indefinite in tire way of a score.

Appi . mately 10,000 people viewed
the annual game between the two
ancient rivals, and the majority of
this numbcr, seated in the uppertiers
of the stadium, expcrienccd con—
siderable difficulty in obsciying the
play due to the presence of a heavy
fog, The field was fairly firm, pro-
viding adcduate footing for the ram-
pages of Mcctcr-, Stotts and McLain in
their trots through the Drake eleven.

Dr ie’x liicliiug ii‘cak

Early in the game it was revealed
that Drake would be kept deep in
thell‘ own territory, due to the lack
of a consistent kicker Cook’s kicks
were sliurt in every instance, con—
tributing a lleaiy advantage to the
Piuriccr team through Mantel": unis
formly good booting It was through
a big gain in this department of play
early in the first stanza that placed
Grinnell in position for Mcetcr to
score his first field goal. The kick
was made from the seaward line, after
sevcral thrusts at the Bulldog line had
been turned back.

The second quarter wasarepitition
of the fir-st in that both teams Carried
the ball for fairly consistent gains, but
the inability of the Drake team to
hold their own in the defensive kick~
ing line, forced them back into their
own territory on numerous ‘ occas»
ions. Following an injury to Meeter
necessitating the substituting of Hugh
McLain‘latc in the second period, the
Pioneers began a concerted march tor
the Drake goal, (in his first two'
plays, McLain torc off two gains of
ten yards each, to place the oval oh
the Drake All-yard line. From this
juncture Lamb tossed a pass to Me-
Lain, and the big halfback completed
the march with a pretty broken field
run for the only touchdown of the
game. Lamb placckicked for the ex-
tra point.

Johnson Nearly Scores

Late this same period Drake came
within an ace of sod ing, when Archie
Johnson, erstwhile Criunell quarter—
back, intercepted one of Lamb's stray
tosses, and ran to the Grinnell 10-yard
line, before Stotts forced him out of
bounds. The play was called back.
however, because of a breech of the
rules by Johnson in his interception.
This break seemed to lower the
morale of the Drake team to a Cone
sidcrable extent.

Several shortdivcd marches toward
Grinnell's goal were instituted by the
Bulldogs in the third quarter. but
none did any damage. on one occas-
iori a series of four consecutive first
downs enabled Drake to reach the
Grinnell 7ryard line, but at diis spot
the scarlet and black line held the
Bulldogs for downs, and Mentor kick—
ed out of danger.
