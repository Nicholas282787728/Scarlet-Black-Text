Flne manners show themselves formidable

MORE MEN.

If the new movement for incl'eltsing the enrollment

of men at Grinnell is to prove most clfective, graduates
and students will have to take an earnest interest in
fulﬁlling the personal obligations rightfully assumed by
all Grinnelllans.

In every society there may be found two distinct
types of people, the "I will” and the "I would" groups.
The "I will" assemblage is the one Which always delivers
the goods, and it is not an that unit that the success
of The new plan hinges. Rather, the ultimate achieve-
ment is poised upon the accomplishments of the (louhtfuls.
1: the procrastlnctors and the indifferent can he made
to feel the immediate obligatory action on their pm-t, the
movement is bound to be effective,

There are no valid reasons why the enrollment of
men should not some day equal, if not exceed, that of
the women. Grinnell has always upheld an estimable
tradition of virility. The type or men who have come to
Grinnell has been truly outstanding and the graduates

What word shall be used, if not an ugly one, to
describe the action of the instructor who habitually, (lay
after day, keeps his class from two to ten minutes over-
time? He not only steals time from ‘the students in his
classes, but he takes it from the other members or the
faculty.

All classes under such instructors follow a fairly
close formula. The class assembles, waits nine and
three-quortcrs minutes for the instructor to appear, and

or all the coeducational colleges in the country,
Grinllell is facilitated among the best for men. Probably
in no other coeducational institution is there ‘ionnd n
more complete nnd independent system of men's govern-
meut than right here at Grinnell.

Grinnell has the goods; there is no need to fear the
opposition. What she needs now is the interest and
cooperative service of her students and graduates in dis-
pensing the truth to prospective students,

“APPLE rulilsnhlls."

Among the pesky parasites of modern» college life,
none are more nnusesting than the "apple publishers", the
group who rush to the front of the room when the
dismissal hell rings, and who linger lovingly about the
classroom whence all but the professor have fled.

True enough, to talk to a professor is no offense; in
fact, that is to be encournged. But there is a great
dissimilarity between the "apple polisber" or the “‘hand
shaker" and the seriously interested student, The
oftensivo lineanlent about the former is the ultimate
motive for which he gabblesia grade.

The prohlem is more serious than might be realized
off hand. The practice of the apple polisber prevents the
earnest student from asking important questions, for the
sincere do not wish to be classed with the other group.
Fraternalizationwith the faculty is thwarted.

Some universities have already taken steps to prevent
the continuance of the disreputable custom. The whole
remedy rests upon the professors. it is solely their duty
to stifle the imprudence oi the “apple polishers" and to
otter personal counsel for the unfeigned.

‘ ALLEGIANCE.

In spite of the Censorious attitude with which the
modern student views tradition, llew will deny the merit
of the old Grinnell tradition of standing uncovered and the
singing of “Sons of Old Grinnell” while the football team
leaves the ﬁeld, \l’hat expression of appreciation to the

be better than a. similar practice at basketball games?

RETRDIUTION VERSUS SCHOOL SPIRIT.
Grinnell is not a large school, from the standpoint
of numbers. Every member or the college has an
important part to play in carrying on the school spirit;-
a bigger part, consequently, than that carried by the
individuals of a large school or university.

Then, should girls who have been cmnpused be
prohibited from attending school athletic contests where
the school spirit must suffer that much? Rather, it
seems more plausible thct they be required to be there,
if c penalty is demanded.

What is the difference Whether the campused parties
are at the quadrangle playing bridge, or at the games
supporting the Grinnell teams? Just that much difference
in school spirit:

Twenty minutes later the whistle blows, facts come
taster and the class is held over for ten minutes. This is
typical ot the way in which some instructors steal time
from one another and from their students.

Instead of using the ﬁfty minutes allotted to them
for their lecture period, they prefer to start their lectures
at the close of an introductory mouth exercise and run
the class ten minutes overtime into some other instrucA
tor's class hour,

The University whistle supposedly marks the close
of the class periods. That seems simple enough to
even be understood by an instructor who wonders how
his students reached college.
