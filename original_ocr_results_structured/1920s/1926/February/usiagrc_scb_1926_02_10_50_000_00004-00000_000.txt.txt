The Sooner-s started out the second
hall strong and took advantage of

or mi ~aiternoon seemed to sap the
strength of Grinnell, and it was with
difficulty that the Scarlet and Black
drihhlers kept within scoring distance
of the southerners. Toward the end
of the game Peterson, Wing. and Da-

to him by a bronze image of Buddha

life to inanimate things.

It is the philusophy of salvation by
escape rather than by repentance. It
says, “I have tasted all happiness and
found that if I counted on its perman-

have known all hope and found it
foolishness; I have endured all suf—

Look at me and learn peace."

When the Russian Symphonic Choir
appears in recital February 1!} lor the
lion's Glee Club, it will present a pro-
gram of beauty and popularity.

llauy elements enter into the pop.
ulaiity of a song. it is not always
melody or triteness which appeals to
a great number of people in a given
pierce of music. In the ease nf so-
ealled popular music or "jazz” a great
deal depends, 0! course, on rythm,
which makes a given composition pars
ticularly "danceable." Sometimes the
words or a song help to make it pop-
ular. in other cases again the hum-
or oi a song, for instance, in “Yes,
ue have no hannanas," strikes the
fancy at the mass or people. The
Symphonic Choir chooses such pro,
grams that the pieces appeal to popu-
lar taste yet are relulgent with classic
melody, _

when the Choir, under the leader--
ship or Basile Kihalehich, gave two
conccr in New York City last spring,
the critic or the New York Journal
singled out for particular attention
the “Credo” by Gretchauinori as fol-

against a background by the other
singers.” It is, in fact, the duty of a
critic to react dispessionately to the
impressions in the concert room, so
that he may give an unbiased review.
And when a critic listens on an aver-
age to s or eight concerts a day. as
is the case in New York City, it is a
great trlhute to the artistic merits or
a concert, when a critic records a
thrill.

The concerts of the Russian Sym-
phonic Choir abound in such thrills.
The “Credo" with its religious in,
tensity is one. The “Lord Have Mere
Cy" with its remarkable pianissimo.
which bcconies a musical whisper, is
another thrill.
