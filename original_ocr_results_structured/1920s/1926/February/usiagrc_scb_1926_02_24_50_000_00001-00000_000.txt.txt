and Northwestern,

Holmes lie-Elected

At the business meeting [allowing
the contest, Charles N. Holmes, '10,
of Chicago, a former member and
brrsiness manager of the a inucll Cleo
club, was re-elected president or the
association, and will again have
charge of the annual contest next
year. Following the dec ion of the
judges, Mr} Holmes announced that
the clubs ranking lowest this year,
would he omitted from the competition
next year, and other schools invited
to send cliihs, in an effort to obtain
more glee clubs of high standing.

The same program as in former-
years was followed out, and each club
sang a prize song selected by the as—
sociation, one of their own selection,
and a college song. The prize song
this year was “The Lamp in the West,"
by Horatio Parker, and Gl‘inuell's
choice song was “Into the Silent
Land,” by Foote. As in former years,
the Grinnell club sang as their closing
number, “The Alumni Song," which
was received with great applause,

Taylor lie-ails Cheering

The college song was the third num-
her on the program of each club, and
those of the audienccyvho were alum-
ni of the school singing, stood during
the song. At the finish of the song,
a yell leader jumped on the stage, and
led the audience in their college cheer.
In former years, there have not been
enough Grinnell alumni present to
yell, but this year besides the alumni
of Chicago and vicinity, a number of
students made the trip, and great ap—
plause greeted, Morgan Taylor, '25,
Olympic champion hurdler ,and him—
self a member of the club that won
first place two years ago, when he
jumped to the stage, and led the Crin-
nell cheering.

The indges of the contest were D. A.
Clippinscr, Glenn Dillard Gum), and
Edgar Nelson, all of Chicago,

Broadcast Twice

Besides singing in the contest, the
Crinnell club broadcasted, together
with the other clubs of the associa—
tion, from Orchestra ball over radio
station KYW, Sunday evening, and
later the same night broadcasted their
own program over VVJAZ.

Yesterday noon they sang for the
anniversary dinner of the Rotary club,
the third successive time they have
been asked to sing tor that organiza-
tion, and last night they were enters
tained at a banquet in the Hotel La
Salle by the Collegiate club, a new
million dollar club of 1400 members.
Twenty-four members of the Grinnell
Club made the trip to Chicago.

half of the inning with five runs but
after that only four men crossed the
home ,plate during the remainder of
the game, East fielding and sunre
good pitching by the Kelly nine kept
the sinithites from scoring much. The
batteries for Smith were Royal, 13a

Clitrk Hall Has Easy Tillie

Clark hall had an easy time of it in
their game with Four “smacking the
pill” in every inning for a barrage of
runs. Fast fielding prevented the
Building Four team from scoring
mirch, and in four of the seven innings
they were held without a run. The
batteries for Clark were Morris and
Kautz; for Four, Linden and Munster.

The Langan-Dibblc contest proved
to be a pitchers duel neither team be-
ing ablc to hunch their hits consistent

game on ice in the sixth inning by gas

up seven counters. The batteries for

Monday's game, contrary to the iri-

uncertain until the last of the fourth
quarter. The Juniors, with the'r

teamwork, but the flashy playing of a
poppy and deter-mined Freshman ag—

The work of Fostlnu Harris, Junior

The Seniors Cup for Women's bas~
ketball was established in 1914 by
Mr. H. W, Somel-s and was to be per—
manently awarded to ﬁle class who

should win it for three years in sllC-V

cession. The Class of 1927 is the
first to win three years in succession.
The tournament this year, however
brief it has been was a successful
proof of the fact that women”: ath—
letics can furnish fully as many
thrills and as ruuch interest as men’s.
Every game of the tournament was
fast, keenly and cleanly played, and
closely contested. The final winning
of thc cup promises to make further
class competition for another such
ciip keeper and more interesting.

Over Stars, llelS.

Better condition and better team-
work were instrumental factors in
the basketball game at the stag party
Saturday night when the freshman
team romped away to an easy 41713
victory over a collection of all-dorm
stars. The prep aggregation took an
early lead and were never sorely
pushed throughout the encounter.

The All-Dorm team, with practically
the same personnel as the mythical
first A team selected by the Scarlet
and Black sports writer, showed
flashes of nice floor work but the ef-
forts were individual and the aggre-
:giition fared poorly as a complete nns
it. The coached prep team, on the
other hand, showed the valuable cf-
iccts or playing together and or con-
drtioning,

I All-Sims Score First

The All—Stars scored first when Fat-
ton looped an easy shot from the side
but the preps retaliated with six
counters in rapid fire order. Slowly
’the iirst year quintet drew away and
by the end of the first stanza the iriclc
up five was holding the short end of
a 23-3 count.

At the start of the second period
the AllrSLars spur-ted and narrowcd
the gap iii the scores. The rally was
‘sllol'trllved, however, and the preps
soon had things their owrr way again.

Gray and Fail were the outstanding
performers for the winner-s, although
the entire team playcd almost on an
-even par. Cray connected with the
looptseyen times from the field for
ilrlgh point honors, while Captain Fail
,played a strong defensive game.

No Outstanding Sta .

There were no outstanding stars for
tho All-Dorm team but ratton and
Canady would probably receive the
call ii such a selection should be
necessitated. Patton and Stcuble
were high point men for the AllsStnrs
with four field goals apiece.

Budlong Is Fourth of
Brothers to Win
Honors Here.

when school closes this spring it
will mark the end of an unusual fam-
ily record in Grinnell's history. For

1917 was the first to enter Grinnell.
Richard, who followed him and gradu-
ated in 1518, was business manager of
the Scarlet and Black his senior year.
The next to follow was Robert Bud-
long who graduated in 1922, and who
was Art Editor of the Cyclone his
junior year,

Roger Budlong who graduates this
year is president of the senior class
and was a member of the 1925 Cyclone

Peterson, Wing, Slim

After leading the Iowa State quin-
tet for three quarters of the game,
Monday night the Pioneers went to
pieces and lost their lead and the
game, but the final score 32 to 23, does
not show the closeness of the game.

Burning under the sting of an over-
whelming defeat at Ames two weeks
ago the Pioneers took the floor deter-
mined to avenge the former Anies
victor-y. Coach Black started Peter-
son and Mark at forwards, Niblo at
ccntcr and Capt. Wing and Hays at
guards. This fivc put up the best
defensive game seen on the home floor
this year and they quickly took com-
mand of the floor. The Aines out-
it seemed at a loss and only had two
shots at the basket for the first six
minutes of the game

Pioneers Gain Lead

The Fionecrs, led by “Rod" Peter-
son and Mark soon had the score at
10-3 in Grinhell's favor. Both teams
then clamped down on firm defensive
games and the scoring for the half
was practically over. The starting
five was lcrt intact until within three
minutes of halfrtime when Moran and
Diwis displaced Wing and Hays. No
scoring was made in the final minutes
of the iii-st period and the score stood
at 13 to s when the teams left the
floor.

The Aggies came back and started
off the second halt with a rush and in
an effort to stop the fighting Cyclones
the Pioneers forgot their defense, al<
lowing Stavei-, Elliott, and Fenneina
to even up the count at 14 all. Two
of these baskets were rare gifts as the

‘Griunell guards were drawn out into

the middle of the court and it was but
a matter of two pas/5&5 and a jump for
a basket.

Aggies Knot Count

With a tie score the Grinneil play
hecaine rather ragged and any otfense
was spoiled by poor passing. Ames
forwards succeeded in intercepting
passes and turning them into markers.
Kling, diminutive forward stepped into
the limelight and put the Farmers in
the lead with four rapid-fire baskets.
Arnold, Amcs guard managed to slide
down the side of the court for three
ringer-s.

Mark dropped in two pretty baskets,
while Hays and Wing each scored
once for Gl'mnell. This was all the
Pioneers were able to do and Davis
made the last point of the evening
with a foul throw. Moi-an showed
some uicc floor work in thc last qual‘~
ter hiit it was useless as the Pioneer
forwards could not work loose for
shots.

Elliott Put Out

Feullemil, Elliott, and Kling were
the class of the Auras outfit. Feunema
sdth edin three baskets, and Elliott
registered nine points, giving him
high scoring honor-s before he was
sent from the game with four person-
als. Kliug, however- was the bright
light of the C, lone fcam. He dis~
llluyed clever flour work and twice
dribbled through Crinnell guards for
easy baskets.

Mark was high point man for Grin-
nell with three baskets and a free
throw. Peterson and Moran showed
nicc floor games, but were unable to
