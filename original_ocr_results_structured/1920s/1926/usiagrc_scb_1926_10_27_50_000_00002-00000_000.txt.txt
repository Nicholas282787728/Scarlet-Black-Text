THE "ALL-AROUND” TYPE.

Entrance to college is, among many other things, an
introduction to strange attitudes and strange espressions
\ ’th which the average individual has scarcely a speaks
lug acquaintance until he, has outgrown the high school
mind. The average person is not long in college until
he becomes immensely impressed with the importance of
an "all-around” development. So-ﬂnd~so, who is scholasr
tically inclined, has never made the football team or the
basketball five.

EDITORIALS OF THE DAY.

“PREPAR G FOIL LI E"

Goose-stepping along the paths or learning we Slur
dents are reminded ever and anon that we are “Prepar-
ing for lite.”

This catch-phrase, forever hohhiiig up in admonislir
irig talks to students, is pretty hut misleading.

Those who utter the phrase apparently look on “lire"
as they look on the man iii the “wonidpleﬂsantf ment
too for away to annoy usior else they regard it as the
Indian did the happy limiting ground he w as certain to
reach by dint of time and a little hard hiclr.
