Decorate
yourself with

the degree \~

of P. A.

THAT means “Pipa Amoroso” in the Latin, or
"pipe-lover” in plain campus English. P. A.
has certainly endeared a pipe to more men than
any other letters in the smoke-alphabet. Because
Prince Albert lets a fellow smoke all he wants

to—and makes him mm! to!

Cool as the stare of a marble Venus. Sweet
as the approach of vacation. Fragrant as spring

blossoms. Think up your awn similes, Fellows.
You will when you pick P. A. and a jimmy-pipe
for permanent roommates. Prince Albert is

great tobacco, and that’s not blah.

ILA. it sold everywhere In
I v 1....
”ill“ .f'“ ». . . .
And always with (WHY bit of
bite and pan/i n-mavcd by
[he Prince Albeit Inna“.

Get yourself a tidy red (in of Prince Albert
today. Fill the bowl of that old jimmy-pipe to
the brim and borrow a match. Then you’re set
for some great smoke-sessions. as sure as you’re

a foot high.

PRINGE ALBERT

—no other tobacco is like it!
