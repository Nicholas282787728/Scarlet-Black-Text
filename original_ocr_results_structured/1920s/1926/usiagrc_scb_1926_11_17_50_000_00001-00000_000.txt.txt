This No Part Ill Millie-“1| of
Celebrated Artist

By Margaret Smith.

From the moment the first bass
notes of the Vivaldi Concerto became
audible above the confusion of seating
last-minutes comers. Alfred Cortot held
the audience under a spell of amaze-
ment and delight. He fail y elect ,
tied his hearers with the lightning
rapidity of his rllns, octaves, arpcgr
gios, his tremendous climaxes, inter-
spersed with passages of simple beaue
ty and tenderness.

At his concert last night in Herrick
chapel, he prol d himself a virtuoso
of the first rank. but this virtuo ty
is obviously a means to an end. ill he
out it, he colild not express the line
questionable sincerity which is the
main reason for his success. He is
‘technically equipped to penetrate mus
sical expressions to their depths. and
his power and brilliance, together-
with a tender poetic feeling. elevate
everything he plays to an unearthly
perfection.

Contrast Coliiplcfe

The Vivaldi Concerto and the Chopin
Andante and Polonaise, the numbers
with which his concert began. were
eloquent and ample proof of this tre-
mendous viruosity of his. The con-
trast between the three movements of
the concerto was complete. The Prae—
ludiumvand particularly the Finale
were all the more sliecmcular because
of the lovely lyric quality of the Aria.
In the words of one New York critic,
"he thundered like a Titan and glided
over those same keys a moment later
with an almost swan-like touch,"

The Twenty-four Preludes of Chopin
were a fascinating group of song
poems, the appreciation of which was
helped materially by the program
notes. Mr. Cortot changes moods at a
breath-taking rate of speed, but his
sincerity as a musician was as lforce-
ful in the "Imprecéttlons" as in the
“Funeral Procession." It was a rice
light to be led from impression to im-
pression, and one of the most inter—
esting of ihese was the familiar D flat
Major Prelude, representing the night—
mare of the young mother rocking her
child. This Prelude group, with the
possible exception of the Liszt Rhap—
sody, made the most lasting impress-
ion ot Mr Curtot's musical intelli-
gence and ability. The Andantino, the
“rider in the night," and the “road 'to
the abyss" will not soon be forgotten.

‘ He displayed further his merit to the
title of ”Chopin pianist par excele
lance” by his encore after this group,
the "Black Key" Etude.

Left Hand Effective

The SaintvSnens Etude was played
with scintillating brilliance. In the
Bouree. the artist carried a medoly
and accompaniment in one hand with
the ease and beauty that most piano
students 1991 fortunate in obtaining
with the aid of both hands. In “La
Cathedral Engloutie," he combined the
song of the sea and the solemnity of
the imaginative cathedral which Dee
bussy represents, with true perfection
of art. His unusual pedal techninue
showed to particular advantage here
The Segnloillas was played at a speed
and brilliance which only a. few in the
world of pianists can hope to attain.
When the program closed with the
finale of Rhapsody Hongroisc. the
applause amounted to a personal ova-
tion, As an encore, he very wisely
chose to play the Brahms Lullaby, for
nothing he could have given would
have contrasted more effectively With
the brilliant close he made.

No .tlt‘ecfatinns

The old ideas of "le .tic tempera
merit" seem to play no part in the
make-up of Cor-tot. It is evident
that as an ar st who is constantly
studying and playing, he has little
time for the affectations which some
people consider part of the stock in
trade of a musician. After all, there
is no connection between extraordine
arily long hair and a good perform—
ance of a Beethoven Sonata, and the
peculiarities of one’s clothes have no
bearing on une's playing of a Chopin
Etude. He has attached no peculiar

GWELL IOWA, WEDNESDAY

By Pioneers On Southern Sojourn

With the return of the Pioneer foot-
ball squad from their semi—successful
southern invasion the usual army of
“interested parties” have been more
or less unsuccessfully trying to get a
few inside details on the trip. For the
benefit of the Quadrangle, such dark
secrets are being Published below as
are deemed printable.

The squad enjoyed the famous Blis-
souri hospitality in Kansas City before
the Kansas game, where they stayed at
the KansaseCity Athletic club. Sulie
day night they left for Ponca City.
Oklahoma, about 40 miles from still-
ivater. The hotel accommodations
there were excellent. according to John
Spencer, who says he hasn't the sliglit~
est inclination to complain.

And tlleu there was the heiress! A
young lady who it is said possesses
half of Oklahoma in her own name
arid will get the other half later, was
smitten by the charms of a certain
young gentleman on the squad, and
invited the entire battalion to dinner
in her hotel suite in order to get zt
better look at him. A fierce contest
ensued betwccn several of the doughty
warriors as they vied with each other
to iltld favor in her eyes. Rumor liath
it that sonny Dal-is and West
stotts ended in about a tie. but
Captain Martin the ”l'eClDi»

elit" of a compact, which may or may

was

not be “petty” larceny under the Ok-
lahoma law.

Between football practice and study-
ing. the boys studied the art of ”os-
aging," a new term for the practice of
acqu ing a squaw. When it was
Whispered about that the Osage Ind-
ians had a weekly income of about
$1000 per cftpitzl, it was with great difr
flculty that Coach Mike could dis-
saul‘le his men from applylng for nat—
uralization papers as squuw-men.

The boys found plenty to amuse
them on a trip to the “101 Ranch,” a
mighty organization that supplies most
of the rodeas of the comma They
have fl regular menagerie on their
vast farm, and a bank of their own.
When it was time to leave it was
found that Cleland was still watching
the turtle races, and didn’t want to go
home. because he was getting pointers
on how to improve his stancc!

Fl‘ldt ‘ the boys left for stilllvnter
and worked out on the A. & M. field.
The game was delayed a few minute.
Saturday as Spencer hunted up a m -
rm to get his headgear on straight.
Apparently this "O‘aglng" idea had
possessed the entire squad.

The boys came back again by way
of Kansas CW' and reached Grillnell
(some of them) by 10:20 Sunday. They-
have many ltlcc souvenirs of their
trip, including a southern accent and a
iattcncd correspondence.

"Out of Grinne'll college ought to
come those who will help make a new
map of the universe," declared J. Stitt
Wilson, well known lecturer, who
spoke at long chapel service Monday
morning. "The materialists have al-
ready given us a map of the universe,
but men are arising, who, not as re-
ligionists. but as scientists and philos~
ophers, are demanding a new and bet-
ter map. The college should train
young men and young women to help
draw a map of the universe, and to be
able to move in it when it is drawn.”

Mr. Wilson announced that the text
of his talk was the "Philosophy of
What If," declaring humorously that.
“like the negro preacher. i will now
depart from it." His talk Monday
morning was an introduction to the
longer lecture which he gave in the
evening. .

Get Spiritual Efficiency

“1 hope to bring some contribution
to you which will enable you to adjust
your inner life to the changing world
around you," he said. “In the last 200
years. and especially within the last
so years, men have gained a wider
knowledge of the universe. As a re
suit. the inner life has lost its old
moorings, and needs to be extended
also. I want to help you to interpret
your lives in the face of this extension,
so you will get spiritual efficiency.

“To map the world is a comparative-
ly achieved thing—now man wants to
map the universe," Mr. Wilson dc-
clared. “1! man had more or less
mind, he would be happy—as it is, he
is in a social, intellectual, and moral
night-mare. The materialists have
mapped the universe according to four
great levels, namely. the level of mat-
ter, the level of life. the level of mind.
and the level of man. They interpret
all planes of life, man, and mind, in
terms of matter. Their philosophy has
almost displaced the necessity of la
God, and done away with the idea of
the moral responsibility of maxi, and
file immortality of man,

a distinct transition from sea-

have due consideration; and that ev.

taming the high standard of previous
years. Much of last year’s talent was
lost, but it is hoped that there a're still
undiscovered stars lurking in the fac-
ulty firmainent. Previous experience
is not a prerequisite, so all faculty-
members with a penchant for the stage
are eligible.

Rumor has it that the play has not
been definitely chosen. and that pel'~
naps this is the purpose of Friday
night's reading. The committee has
read and considered at least half a
dozen various plays, melodramas, co-
medies, farces, both old and new: but
no single play was a unanimous
choice, There is a rather persistent ru~
mor, however. that "Charle Aunt"
is the most likely candidate; at least
the last Experimental theatre pro
gram announced “a rollicking, old
English farce which has beeeii a Derv
onnial favorite in its own and in this
country for years. The undivided efv
forts of a notably excellent cast will
be expended solely for the edification
and delectation of the audience."

If this inmor has foundation, Mr.
Angus realizes that both the faculty
and the Experimental theatre which
will produce the play are confronted
with iull two months of labor. Even
the producing staffs are being select-
ed with utmost care, and greatest at-
tention will be devoted to appropriate
casting of the play itself. The one
