Congregational lﬁnistel's and
Bring Scssiou to Close ll'rth
Osborne’s Gates Lecture.

A Jewish Rabbi and an Episcoplalian
Bishop lurnished a contrast when
they addressed the Fellowship conv
fer-ence.oi ministers and laynren at
the Congregational church, Thursday
duel-noon,

Rabbi Eugene htanuhcimer of Des
hloines spoke on the topic, “Toward a
Better Understanding Between Jews
and Christians," while the Rt. Rev.
Harry S. Longley, Bishop coadiustor
of the Episcopal church (or the dis-
trict of Iowa spokeon “Children of
Today are the Men and Women of The
le'l‘OW."

Seventy-lite Attend

The twelith annual 'conierence
brought its five day sessions to aclose
Friday morning with the fifth and
last Gates lecture by Dr. Nahoth Os-
borne On Thursday Dr. Osborne de-
livered two lectures, ‘nne in the morn-
ing at long chapel and the other in the
evening on “Jesus and Inter-national
Relanonships."

Rollowing the morning devotion by
Dr. E, A. Steiner, Thursday's program
was opened by an address by Dr. C.
T. Burton. secretary oi the corurcil, on
"The Casual Cross.”

Both Interested in Religion

I am not one of those who declare
that the young people or today are
going to the devil," said Langley. “But
in sohie respects the indictments
against our youth are true. i
inclined to think that they are not in—
terested in.church, in religion; and
because we have little or no religion
in our hbmes, in'our schools, in our
colleges and universities. \Ve've been
too busy getting dollars and havo left
God out."

"If‘we’rc going to solve the prob—
lems of today we've got to get Cod in-
to it,” the speaker continued, quoting
tronu a prominent business man. Men-
tioning the present efforts to putGod
before the youth of today, the bishop
declared them to be lacking. The
Sunday school ior one thing does not
have the efficient teaching organiza-
tion to hear the burden alone. The
reading of the Bible in the weekday
schools is forbidden in some states.
and must be read without comment in
others

Rev. Langley mentioned the growing
influence of weekday religious educd.‘
tion. The eighty cities experimenting
with it a year ago have grown to two
or three thousand.

”This is not combining church and
state,” declared the speaker, “but ran
ligion and state. And we must have
religion in the state if the state is to
endure.”

dinnirhcimcr Speaks

“A new era of tolerance, goodiwll,
and fellowship must be brought about
by Jewish, Protestant, and Catholic
religious leaders if tutnre generations
in America are not to be left a heri-
tage of narrow racial and religious
prejudices," said Rabbi Mannheimer.

The Rabbi said that there was an
antipathy which might be destroyed
through a better respect for each otbe
er. The majority has always claimed
the minority inferior and the minority
has never admitted it. There iS’Tia
choice between the Jewish arrogance
and narrowness and Christian arro—
gance and narrowness. “It is of
course noteworthy that the Jew is not
the only group singled out by this up-
American effort to ‘foment racial and
religious discord in this country," he
said.

Jews have been ior nineteen hone
dred years held responsible for the
death of Jesus Christ, although the
Romans were in part to blame. if
Christian Sundayrschools would not
bring out the point so evidently but
show that the present generation of

/Jews has really no blame on its
shoulders, there would he a tendency
toward cooperation and better under-
standing which at present does not
exist.

Russian Symphonic Choir Appear-s
l-lerc l‘ebruar‘y 19 as a llenor‘it For
The Hell’s Glee Club.

On February is the Russian Sym-
phonic Choir will appear in Crinrrell
in a benefit recital for the Men's
Glee Club. The obtaining of funds to
be used in financing the trip to
the Chicago contest is but incidental
for the \zlrrahgements to have the
choir appear here have been made
some time ago.

The Russian Symphonic Choir, the
only one in the country is a unique
organization in the high quality of
the voices which compose its membel'e
ship. in the usual sort oi choir-s
which are built along traditional
lines, attention is given to the duality
of entire sections. Thus, we discuss
the soprano section and the terror sec-
tion of a choir. But the Russian Choir
is a compact body oi more than twen-
tyuiive members and each voice has
an important part to play in the m-
terpretation of each member.

Mr. Kibalcblchselects his individual
members with as much care as a con-
ductor of a symphony orchestra
lects each member oi his orchestra.
Particular care is given by Mr. Kin-
alchich to the timbre of each voice, to
the range, to the quality f the voice
and finally to the solo abil es of each
singer As a result, the Russian
Choi is a body of solo singers joined
together under the leadership or a
master mu crap in order to produce
an organization which has been called
by many c ies a “human orchestra."

Some critics of the New York press
have commented on the individual
qualities of several oi the loices. For
example, the New York Journal said,
“One of the most thrilling experiences
we have had in the concert room this
season was the performance of "Cre-
do" by Cretchaninoff, the words irr-
toncd with a resonant intensity by
young mezzo of the choir against a
background by the other users."

The New York American .id: "The
individual members are evidently silo
ed and trained singers for above the
ordinary." This also enables Mr. Kill-
alchich to include a number of cum»
positions in his programs requiring
the services oi first-class soloists, ac-
companied by the choir, as they would
be by an orchestra.

Must Be Force Or

Display Back Of

Government, States Gates Lecturer

“You cannot have a government oi
any hind without having force or dis-
play in the background," said Dr.
Naboth Osborne at his fourth Gates
Memorial lecture delivered in Herrick
chapel Thursday evening.

"There is iorce everywhere,” said
Dr. Osborne," in any kind oi c govern-
rrrent that is worthwhile. Righteous-
ness in any kingdon of God must come
before peace Humility does not con
sist in humi rtion nor in cringing,
brrt in self respect, respect for others
and respect for‘God. when a man
goes to war in spite ol his hatred of it,
be is bearingthe Christian's cross.

Early Christ us nought

“what is a Chr tian going to do
about Christ’s prenchurents against
the use of force?" asked Dr. Osborne.
in answer, he pointed to the lives of
the men who knew Jesus host and who
did not follow the literal work of his
teaching. The last book oi the new
testament that of Revelation, “is filled
with blood on evcry page." The early
(‘hl'isititns did not oppose war because
oi any scrupics against it, but be-
cause they could not take the oath re-
quired oi Roman soldiers and retain
thcrr faith.

liowever, Dr. Osborne expressed
hirnseli as opposed to all fighting c.
ccpt in righteous sell deierrse and de-
clared hirnseli firmly against u-a

lie pointed out that all the Achiever
merits oi the ,last hundred years have
aided in the development of those
conrmon bonds which hold people to-
gethcr, but that in spite of this tend»
ency, the old hostility still remains,
bccause nations cmphpsizc the things
which divide rather than unite.

Drake Pror‘essor to Tell Sto of ..tlrc
German Vote ili|Itl the Election oi
“01d lloncst .lbc."

Prof. F. I. Her-riott of Drake univc —
sity, national authority on economics
and political science, will deliver the
iourth number of tire college lecture
course at Herrick chapel Friday eve-
ning, February 12, at eight o'clock.
l-lis lecture subject will be "The Ger—
man Vote and Lincoln."

During recent years, Professor He
riott has made a special study and m~
vestigation oi the effect oi the Gel-r
man vote on the election oi Lincoln to
the presidency. This is a factor
which has been under consideration
for a very short time, and Professor
Her-riott is probably the best inform-
ed man on the subject h ths’country,

Professor Hcrrott‘s general objec-
tive in the address will be to "expli’lin
Lincoln’s elevation at Chicago in 1360,
and he will deal oi the factors that
chiefly account for Lincoln's remark-
ahlo nomination contrary to public ex-
pectation. ~

Research has made it seem pmb-
able that Lincoln owes hrs election to
the presidency to his ability to swing
the preponderance of the vote of’ the
German people in the country to his
side. it is Herriotts opinion that
people tail to realize at the present
tune the tremendous inflnerrce that
the German voting element had on the
elections at that time.

It is particularly appropriate that
this lecture should come on meoln's
birthday. Grinnell people feel that
they will be fortunate in hearing Pro-
fessor Her-riott, as he is exceptionally
well informed on this phase oi Lin-
culli's life.

Forensic Me_ets for
Discussmn of Plans

“The, Relation of Grirrriell Forensic
to the Grinnell campus was the sulr
Ject discussed in the cluhroom of
Building Four yesterday evening
when Gr-iimell Forensic- started its
year‘s work. Four of the honorary
faculty members ‘oincd with the stu-
dents in the fest' as or the evening.

James Work, president or the or-
ganization, welcomed the new men
and bl‘inly outlined the program for
the rest of the year. The discussion
was prec tied with it dinner in the
men's (ii ing YOU“), and ClOSDd prom~
ptly at 7:30. ”The first law 01
our decnlogue shall be to close on
time,“ said the president in adjourn-
ing the meeting.

Does not llnild Empires

\Viu' lms its apologists, he Cuntinur
ed, who say it has built empires, but,
the speaker added, nations have also
sunk by warfare. Some maintain that
war purges nations oi rottcnncss,
that it inspires them with ncw ideals,
hopes and aspirations; but,- said Dr.
Osborne, it has also dovitalized ne—
tions. To the statement that war in
the long run creates moral power in
the form of discipline, obedience and
heroism, he replied that peace gives
the sanre chance for these. “War
doesn't malres heroes, but simply gives
them a chance to be. s,lzeace offers
many opportunities just as great as
any to be found on the field of bat-
[10.”

Four classes of pcoplo defend war
in all times and places; iirst, there
is the sincere patriot; second, there
are the iingoes who “write attire head
oi the editorial coluums oi their pc—
pears, "My country right or wrung,’
forgetting that righteousness and
justice are greater than nationsr'
third, there are the nreu with military
training, who ioresce themselves be-
rcit of a profession if war he abolish—
cd; and finally, there are those who
profit by the mangled bodies of sol~
diers.

Product oi Immature Mind

There will be less corriidence in war
as a means oi settling international
disputes, according to Dr. Osborne,
“when we know that it is the product
of an immature mind," and when we
realrze that “the easiest thing in the
world is to create war- when people
want to go to war. A man can steal
my handkerchief and i don't think
much about it, but ii a man prrlls
down the flag, the cry goes up, ‘Sboot
him on the spotl'" The injustice of
par, its pathetic ridiculousness and
its economic wastelulnc are other-
factors that mitigate against the corn
tinuance of wariarc'nni‘ﬁhg nations,
“There is nothing in the world ’i hate
and have bated for so many you - as
war and its contemplation."

However, the speaker said he could
not agree with those who maintained
'that they would never support the na-
ltiou in war, nor allow the church to
support hostilities. Fifteen years ago,
he iouud himself one of a small
group who opposed war, and now he
again finds hirnseli isolated, because
others have leaped ahead or him so
far that they do not know the bound
cries of the land they have entered.

I
l

Wars are of three kinds; wars of
aggression, wars fought for mixed
motives, and wars oi liberty and de-
iencc from invasion. The first two
are worthy of Christran support, but
when ntlnzln says that he will not
support his nation in any war, he
simply says that ii the Chinese and
Russians were to combine for the pure
pose oi wiping out what ci zation
arid-democracy we have, he would not
liit a finger to prevent it,

over the Oklahoma Aggie, on the lat-
ter's iloor.

Using a revamped lineup, the rice
peers avenged themselves for the 31—

ern team on the local floor two weeks
ago. The Aggies were off color in
their basket shooting and Coach
Black's men took good advantage of
the situation. In the first half the
Farmers succeeded in hitting the hoop
but once from the field.

‘Moran was high point man of the
game, sinking tour goals from the
field and tour gratis throws. Niblo, at
guard, had a nice eye for the hoop,
looping three counters for a total of
six points.

Perry led the Aggie scoring with
~iive field goals while Elder, running

for two baskets.

The fouling of the Pioneers nearlye
proved their undoing, for Brown, the
