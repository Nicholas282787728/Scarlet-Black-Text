ii rUliLlOATlor FEE

As announced elsewhere in this is<‘

mously recommended to the faculty
the establishment or a publication ice.‘
Its purpose is to create a ﬁrmer n-,
nanoial basis tor the annual and to
give it and the Scarlet and Black to‘
the student body at a reduced rate.

This is no radical departure. ‘The
publication fee is an institution in
many 01 our leading colleges and uni-
versities. it is as sound in principle
and everyone
recognizes that the collective buying

concerned. It is our prophecy,
grounded on the development 0! Dub»
llcatlons in other schools, that the fee
basis will sooner or later be recog-

as the semester tee,

nizcd as a superior plan at Grinneli.

And such a plan would be sound in
Practice. We should support a Cy<
clone or the highest caliber. This is
ﬁnancially possible only through the
co-operntion of every student—and it
all co-operate, the expense to the in-
dividual is lessened and the book is
bettered. An annual board would be

ed by lack of tunds, or at 'least by ﬂn-

great deal or their time in devising
Ladies Aid Society methods to eke
out their budgets.

As for tha Scarlet and Black, little‘
need be said. it is now being fur-
nished to its Subscribers at far less
than cost. it the publication fee were

MONDAY
Reverend s, K. Tompkins, pastor.
elect of the Central Congregational
Church or Boston, was the chapel
speaker on Monday. Scientidc inven-
tions, he said, are wondorrul if they
are rightly used, but we must learn
to control the power we have gener—
ated, and to increase our control in
proportion as we increase our power.
We live in a scientiﬁc age, and science
is a. blessing if governed rightly. We
should take all the material gitts
science can otter, but we sshould also
keep in fellowship with Christ, so
that our lives may be centered in the
kingdom or God rather then in the

kingdom of seitlshness.
