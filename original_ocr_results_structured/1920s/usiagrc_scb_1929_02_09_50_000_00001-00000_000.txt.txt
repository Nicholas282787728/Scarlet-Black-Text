“What others say about us should
not matter." Dr. Edward A. Steiner
said, speaking at a meeting of the Y.
w. C A. Thu day night in the quad-
rangle drawing-room. ”We are prb
marily of value to ourselves. We
should try to learn the truth about
ourselves. and then to say. ‘I will not
take anything about myself as final:
I am going to grow!’ " ,

He spoke of the truth session. "the
new sport succeeding the CrossAWord
puzzle" as something not altogether-
beneficial. “What we are impresses a
number of people in as many differ-
ent ways. It impresses other people
differently than ourselves.

"We should learn to measure our-
selves." he said. "by certain ethical
concepts which make the dividing line
hetween the helpful and harmful. the
creative and destructive personality.
After we have realized this primary
value to ourselves. we must realize
that we are. after all. social beings.
and that only by making truth. self-
lessness. and aspiration for a fuller.
richer. integrated life our aims will
we fulfill our highest function in so
ciety."

Sarah Inness MacDonald Appears
In Piano Recital In Chapel
Friday Evening.

The performance of Sarah lnnes
MacDonald at her pianofortc recital
in Herrick chapel last evening was
marked with prc on and unusual
technique. Tile audience felt always
that Miss MacDonald had in control
her comp . ion and her instrument,

The l' group of numbers. music
of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries; included a variety of corn»
no. tions. from ”The Waving Scarf"
and “Little Windmills" by Couperin
to “Andante con Variazoni" in F min-
or by Haydn. “Little VVindniiIIS" was
clever nnd charming where the an-
dante was melodious. .liss MacDoir
ald played Mozart's “Romance" as an
encore to this group.

The second division of the program.
the Sonata. op. 22. in G minor. by
Schumann. exhibited the musicians
power and served as a representation
of her characteristics.

The last group. which included
modern compositions was remarked
upon as showing bduyancy and vivac-
ity. "Schcrrino." a composition by
Rudolph Ganz. who appeared here
this season. was one of the numbers
presented. The placidity of “Tile Lake
at Evening” by Grlifes was delightful
after the tinkling harmonies of “The
Fountain." The continuous tinder-
tone produced a telling effect in Con-
trast with that occasioned by the last

Quite Out-Gained. Grinnell Wins
Grid-Contest: “his Fall By
Touchdown Margin.

When Grinnell and Marquette clash
tonight, it is probable that for the
third time this season. two teams de-
termined to score and score (rev
ouontly will fight it out to a one or
two point victory which may go to
either team. Less than a month ago
the Hilltoppers swept to a two point
victory over the Pioneer cagers while
a battle of thrills on the gridiron this
fall ended 13 to 20' in» favor of Grin-
nell when both teams did all of their
scoring in eight minutes.

so far the two schools have staged
typical Grinnell games. Marquette
has on both occasions piled up a
secure lcad and then Grinnell has
collie back. This winter the Mil-
waukee cagers held something like a
ten point lead as the first half ende
ed and then the Scarlet and Black
came up only to lose as it missed two
free throws in the closing seconds.
The score was 27 to 25.

On Ward field this fall. after the
Golden Avalanche had swept the field
for three quarters, scoring thirteen
points and holding Grinnell to a total
of one yard gained. the Pioneers came
back to win 20 to 13 on passes.

With such -a record behind them. it
is hard to say what will happen toe
night. Grinnell was distinctly in
a slump Monday when Carleton romp-
cd to ii one sided victory. but a new
series of plays perfected this week,
and five days of rest should bring
(‘oach 'i‘i'uesditle’s men -b:ick into
form. If Truesdaie starts the five
which has worked together most this
week. Captain Coggeshall and Ingram
will he at forwards. Humphrey. at
center and Fail and Douglas at
guards. Frequent substitutions seem
likely with Minier .who was the star
Grinnell basket shooter at Milwaukee,
Delong. Ruff. . acy and McCully
probably entering the line up before
the tilt is finished:

Gebert, who gave the Pioneer grid.
ders the most trouble this tall. will
be in the starting five for Milwaukee
and it is probable that he will
iump center against Humphrey- al-
tliough he sometimes is shifted to
King. a guard. and the scor-
ing ace against Grinnell earlier this
winter will be a marked player to-
night.
