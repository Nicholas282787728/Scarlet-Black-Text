Bluejays Have Chance To Tie For
Missouri Valley Title By
Defeating Grinnell.

TEAMS IN GOOD CONDITION

Pioneers See Chance to Uonclude
One of Best Grid Seasons
In Many Years,

When the Pioneers meet Creighton
university here Friday atternoon in
what is the most crucial Missouri
Valley game of the year as far as
Crinnell is concerned, a team which
never seems to he at top form unless
it is behind will again represent the
scarlet and black. To win in a last
minute rally has become the usual
thing for Crinnell. To heat than
oiiette, she overcame a thirteen point
lead in the last quarter and to heat
Washington, she came up from be-
hind. \ . .

The high point

or the seasonior

Grinnell ians

was the fourth

quarter of the

Marquette game

‘iieers scored

inevitable until rail blocked a “Gold

and Bradley fell on the hall over the
goal.

an occasion, however, Gi'innell has
played the “safe and sane" variety oi
football. To win from Iowa State at
homecoming 3 to o, the Pioneers
scored early and then took no
chances. Kicking always beiore the
fourth down, never fumbling. never
losing ground, they kept their scant
margin against a team doped to win
by two touchdowns,

Although she is still undefeated on
Ward field this year, Grinnell has
lost twice abroad this season. How-
ever, when Drake won 19 to 7, the
scariet and black gridders launched
their passing attack, which has hecn
so effective since, tor the first time,
Behind nineteen points after three
quarters of continued hammering,
they launched a last minute attack
which carried them the length of the
field twice and scored once. The
Kansas university tilt, the other
Grinnell defeat, was the opposite type
of game. For three and a half quar-
ters neither team threatened to score.
Continued exchanges of punts netted
little ground for either eleven and
no fumbles, until the crucial ones,
oficred a scoring opportunity. Then
two tumbles produced fourteen points
for the Jayhawks. ’

Lacks Punch “'iill Point

The other two games, the opening
one in which Grinnell defeated Penn
college 19 to G and the Iowa State

‘Teacners game which ended in a
scoreless tie, failed to show Grinnell
as the fighting eleven ot the other
tilts.

The game Friday means much to
Grinnell. IL is her only chance to
Come out in the Valley Slandr
ings. With a defeat from Drake and
a victory over Washington, her cone
fel'ence standing is ,500 and a victory
would alter it to .667 while a defeat
would make it .334,

Likewise it is important to Creigh—
ton. So far the Omaha eleven has
kept a clean slate in the Missouri
valley, which she Entered' this year.
and a victory Friday would mean a
tie for the championship. A defeat
would put her below Grinnell in the
standings.

Psychology favors both teams.
Creighton, admittedly, would he will-
ing to lose all of her tilts and
beat Gi-innell while the Pioneers will
be fighting to keep a clean slate on
Ward field. Both teams are in ex—
cellent condition. 1 l 4

Rose Goes Over For Touchdown In
‘ Last Quarter; Ruff Accounts
FonExtra Point,

Eleven Washington Bears rumbled
and roared only to lose 7 to s to a
hardy band of Crinnell Pioneers last
Saturday at St. Louis, when, just to
show that his feat against Marquette
was no fluke, Captain Fail blocked a
Washington university punt, Rose
made a touchdown and null made a
neat place kick for the point after
touchdown.

Bears didn't mean a thing to
Pioneer gi-idders after they had a
point lead, The
youths, muddled until they were uue
recogn .able, fought into the last
quarter, iorced the Washington gride
dcrs to kick from their own 20 yard
line and rail blocked the punt. Linc
pla two passes and a triple lateral
pass with Rose rece' ' g accounted
ior x points, The w nning margin
came from the toe of Russell null,

A pair oi good kicks and a so yard
run by Rnwtlzin gave Washington its
chance in the second period with tour

line and Wlilttler scored the touch-
down.

In the third period, Douglas, who
has been playing a crack game in
the backtield, continued to drive into
the Washington line and Richcv wisv
gled on the tackles for occasional
jaunts bilt the backs couldn't make
their downs consistently and it look-
ed gloomy for the Pioneers.

The Pioneer backfield was being
laid out on all sides late in the game,
Douglas, Rose, McIntire, Richey be
ing listed among the missing,

The Grinnell tight continued, how-
ever, and the attempted place kick by
nuif from the 33 yard line late in the
game was short by a matter of inch-
es. The big stars of the game were
Eail, Rosie and Ruff. For Washing

his 30 yard riln to put his team in
scoring position and Whittler made
many gains.

Pratt and Urban Sing Solo Parts
In Cantata Sunday Afternoon
At Vesper Service.

Dr. C. Herbert Knight's musical
greatness was evidenced anew to the
Grinneli audience on last Sunday af-
tei-noon when his cantata, “whence
Then Cometh Wisdom?" was present—
ed by the resper choir with organ
accompaniment by the composer. The
soloists, Leah Pratt and Arline Ure
ban,'nnil the entire clioi with the
director, Proi. George L. Pierce, per-
ioruied their parts in a w v that
was most efiective and inspirational

The work was so thoroughly enjoy-
cd that the only unfavorable on i-
cism heard was in regard to the
brief length, "“’nsn't it short?” seve
ei-al people remarked. The entire
audience would no doubt have been
glad to have had the cantata pro-
longed, for they found it delightiully
satisfying while it lasted.

The fine interpretation of the solo-
ists'was an important iactor in the
success of the performance. Leah
Pratt, contralto, sang the heavier
solo roles with the strong, sure now.
er that they demanded, yet she never
seemed to force her ioice. Arline Ur<
ban presented the soprano role with
such admirable poise and musician
ship that her work was distinctly un-
usual for a strident soloist. I-lci- singe
iiig had the delicate, melodic quality
which was suggested by the words
and accompaniment, and which made
an effective contrast with ,the con-
tralto selections.

The service was entirely a musical
program, including the customary
numbers by the choir as well as the
cantata. The words used in the cum
tata were taken from Job, chapter 28.
Proverbs, chapters 3 and s, and from
the poetry of Caleb T. Winchester,
John Keble and M, w. Stryker The
