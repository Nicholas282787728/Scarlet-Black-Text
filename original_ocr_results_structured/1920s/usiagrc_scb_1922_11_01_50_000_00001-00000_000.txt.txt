Pioneers Rllh Up Against Stroﬁg-

This Season.

NORELIUS IS TOWER OF
STRENGTH IN THE LINE

Kitchen Springs Surprise With
Long End Ruins — Iis Valu-
able Pioneer Find.

Pitted against the strongest of- L
fensive team that they have faced this ‘

season and lacking the piinch to
crumple their opponents defensive,
the Pioneers were beaten fairly and
decisively by their old rival, Coc, at
Cedar Rapids Saturday. The game
abouuded in brilliant work done by i .

di idual Pioneers but as a unit the'

tcam seemed to have lost the co-
oipcration which characterizcdtbeir
play in the Arnes game. A drop kick
in the first quarter and two touch-
downs in the second and third quai—
ters added up to give Coe a 15 to o
victory. eight points less than the
Cedar Rapids mcn ran ‘up against the
Ames team. ,

In the ﬁrst three quarters of play
the Coe
things pretty much their own way.
The Pioneers frequently made des—
perate efforts to stage a come back
but an intercepted pass or some
other freak of hick always doomed
such attacks to failure almost before
they could get well under way. HowA
ever; in the final pei'iofl of the game
with the score 15 to o and some of
the spectators leaving under- the im-
pression that the game was over, the
Crinnell team made a last bid for a
touchdown which was nothing less
than historic. But once again the
gods were unpropitious and the ﬁght-
ing Crinnell team was forced to hear
the final whistle blow without having
any counters chalked up on their
side of the score.

Copt. Norelius was the hero oil the

Duke and Nichols also played good

to check the Coe advances which
came through the line like a battering

long gains repeatedly around the

would soon outrun his interference

Pikers on Wuf'd ficld Saturday after-
lnoon, two of the most evenly matched
tc'anis in the Missouri Valley cons
icrcrrce will be seen in action.

Although badly crippled from their
severe battle with Coe, a strong line.
up will be presented to the Pioneer
followc s. It is certain that Wood,
LDarc and Whitehill will be out ofsl‘he‘

LCommunity Hospital with blood pois- ,
oning, the result of a badly infected -
foot. \thI'e‘s, knee was injured in the

,with a sprained shoulder. I-fass in-
jured his leg in practice Tuesday, and
it is doubtful if he will he in shape
‘hy Saturday.‘ 1

The work of Kitchen, flashy Negio
half, which proved the sensation of
the Coe game, will very likely win
him it chance to start Saturday.

Filters Defeated by Allies.

Washington emerged from the Ames
game Saturday on the short end of a.
13 to 0 score, with Amen holding the
advantage at all times except for a:
brief period 'duriDg the third quarter,
in which they worked the ball to the
‘Ames 9 yard line, only to lose it on
downs. Several of the Ames regulars
word out of the contest with inluries.

The Washington team came through
the gamein good shape, with Kurrus,
left tackle, the only man on the in-
jured list. This leaves quite a hole
in the Filter line-up, however ,as
there is a dearth of capable tackle
substitutes there, Coach Rider may be
forced to shift the guard over to
tackle, filling this gap by Gould, who
did not play the Ames tussle.

.For Washington, Tbuinser and
Greene were the most consistent
ground gainers Saturday. Greene
was sent in at quarter shortly after
‘Lhe game started, and proved his
worth by his remarkable work. Only
the passing and receiving of these two
players kept the score from being
considerably more onosided, and it
is upon these two men that much of
.the responsibility will rest in satur-
day s game

nope Favors Griunell.

From comparative scores, and judg»
ing by the showing of the two teams
against Anies, Grinnell holds the ad-
vantage. If Grinnell could hold the
Ames Aggies to a 7 to 0 score, and
that touchdown on a fluke, While.
\Vztslllhglop lost to them 13 to h with
Antes playing a patched linc-up, the
Scarlet and Black should start a two-

The cross country dual which will
