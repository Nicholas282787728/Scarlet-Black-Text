this spring indicates that Coach 6. ll,
Duke's team will face one of the
most representative schedules in re-
cent years. Three dual meets are inr
cluded on the program, with two re-
lay carnivals and the Missouri Vale
ley conference meet to top the list.

Opening with the Home Meet on
April 12 and 13, Coach Duke will have
an opportunity in see his varsity men
performing at their best in. their
events, and a fine line on prospects
for the coming relay mets will be are
fered. The Kansas Relays will be
visited the week following. with the
Drake relay carnival a week later.

The Pioneer mile relay team, which
seems to have a fine chance of 1312.04

are fighting for positions on the

Carleton will open the varsity sea-

successful in turning back the Grin-
neli team lost spring when the Mal-
tese runners invaded Northtieid, hill
the Dukemen have fond hopes of
turning the tables on Coach Milen’s
men.

Omaha. where the Creighton Bluejays
will he met in a dual meet, The
Pioneers are given the edge on paper
to cop this meet. Drake will close
the local appearances of the Fioneel-ss
on May 13, when the Bulldogs will
appear on Ward field. This meet
promises to be one of the features of
the iocal.athletic season.

The Missouri Valley meet will end
the official season for the Pioneers.
The conference seems to be opposed
to having the meet in Stiiiwatcr be
cause of the difficulty of access to a
majori v of the teams, The present
indications are that the meet will he

Omaha.

Several Pioneer runners will doubt-
