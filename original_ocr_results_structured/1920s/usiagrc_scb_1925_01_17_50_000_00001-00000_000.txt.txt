When the Italian Fascisti introduced
castur oil as a standard cure for Com-
mllnism and other national ills, they
did not know how true a symbol they
had found. By this time they are learns
ing that while castur oil makes an ex-
celent medicine, it is not so good for
human nature's daily food.

Mussolini’s famous March on Home
inactobcr, 1922, was an act of del -
erance for the Italian peoplc, deliver»
ance from Chronic misgol'el‘mnent by
political factions, none of which was
strong enough to be responsible.

Thc situation was desperate, The
italian nation, rich in nlanepower but
wretchedly"poor. in natural resources,
was brought to the verge of bankrupt-
cy by the war. Widespread unemploy-
ment made it difficult to reduce the
suollen ranks of public servants, and
yet each branch of the public service
was piling up huge deficits. Any at—
tempt to reduce personnel or wages in
the railway, postal, telegraph and tele»
phone, and other public senices, was
frustrated by- devastating strikes. The
labor unions were dominated by com-
munist lenders, who engineered large-
scale seizures of factories ,by work—
men and of estates by the peasantry.
Opposition was overborhe by mob vio—
lence and terrorization. The govern-
ments that rapidly succeeded each
other, as different groups of factions
gained majoriles in parliament, were
too feeble to preserve order or to sug-
gest any remedy better than temporiz»
mg compromise. Italy seemed to be
drifting into bankruptcy and anarchy.

The Fascisti were organized to ﬁght
fire with fire, to enforce peace by vio-
lence outside the law. The national
organization of our Klan, the functions
at our border vigilantes, offer a fair
parallel. ltiussoiini, an err—Socialist
and a war veteran, editor of an influe
entlal newspaper, was one at the or—
gnizers. The sinews of War were Sup-
plied by industrialists and business
men who wanted to put the Commun-
ists to rant. The fighting force was
made up of the young dare-devils who
had been the shock-troops of the army,
always sent ﬁrst OVEr the top during
the war. Instead of hand grenades.
they now used liberal forced doses of
Castor oil.

This counter-revolution succeeded.
Communist agitators and hooligans
got a taste of their own medicine,
Strikes were broken. hundreds of our
ciallst city governments were forced
to resign, communislic labor head-
quarters Were sacked and burned. In
1921 there were 2200 groups of fight—
ing Fascisti. with 350,000 members,
and Mussolini Was sent. to Parliament
heading a delegation of 32 Fascist deri-
uties.

The injection of a new and militant
group into 8. Parliament already rent
by warring factions was an irritant
rather than a cure. Governments rc-
mained Vucillating and impotent. In
October, 1922 the Fascisti held a great
national convention ill Naples, which
adopted with It whoop Six peremptory,
demands an the Government, formu-
lated by Mussolil ', which included the
dissolution of Parliament and the
turning over of the six most import—

SYEAKERS FOR AFFIRMA’IIVE.

For Both Sides.

In a return debate with Iowa State
college, held in the A. R. H. audi-
torium last Wednesday evening, a local
ul’irirmativc team composed of Wile
liain Wood, Russell Smith, and Loren
Reid met an Amos negative of Cecil
Jefferson, Joseph Kennedy, and Lloyd
Peterson, in a lumbering discussion of
our foreign policy.

"Resolved; That this House con-
demns the foreign policy of the United
States since the war, (it being uildcl'r
stood that our poll touard nations
on the American continent, Asia, Af»
rica, and Russia are excluded from
the debate)" was the proposition dis
cussed.

The debate was an unusually mo~
notorious display of incilectire speake
mg and lack of preparation Ncithcr
tcam seemed to have a well organized
case, and the locals \vele at a particu-
lar disadvantage by virtue of knowing
little of u hat they were arguing about.

The decision was a variation of tho
regular audience type, and will he
used in the remaining debates of the
year. Each member of the audience
was given :3. ballot on which he was
to register his opinion on the question,
both before and after the debate. In
this way all changes in opinion could
be analyzed. Following is the record
of vote changes:

11%, Grinnell 50%.

Opening the argument for the all
tirinative, William Wood persistently
roitcrated'that the United States gov-
eriimcnt has not fulfilled the desire of
the nauon to cooperate to the fullest
extent with other nations in the at
tempt to abolish war and settle politie
cal and economic problems, since the
World War.

Mr. Jefferson, opening the argument
for Aines, gave a well memorized
speech maintaining that the United
States has continued her pl‘cewal' pole
icy of holding conferences in thc in-
terests of world peace, citing the
Washington Conference as on exaln~
ple; and asserting that by staying out
of the League the United States has
been freer and more unbiased in its
attempts to aid in world progress.
He also maintained that further rela—
tions with the other nations of the
world would have resulted in the
scrapping of the Monroe Doctrine, on
which, he said, our national integrity
and life have been built.

Russell Smith, in the least mono-
tonous address of the evening pre-
faced by a little timely wit, maintained
that the United States has, since the
war, goric back on her traditional and
expressly announced policy: and that
our refusal to co-operatc with the na-
tions of Europe in settling post-war
problems had been responsible in a
large measure for the French invasion
of the Rulll' and for the general strife
among the nations 0! the world. This
was Smith’s first appearance on a lo.
cal debate platform, and his presence
was distinctly pleasing,

In an earnest manner, Joseph Ken-
nedy told how the iniquitous Treaty of
Versailles has been responsible for
European economic and political dis-
ruption; and maintained that it into
the credit of the United States that
we have not signed the Treaty, there-
by diving our sanction to its infamous
as , iients. Kcnncdviui-ther asserte
ed that the League of Nation the oife

Giulia Wednesday.

Unable to hold the speedy sopho—
mores, the senior basketball team
was deleated by a score of 16 to 7 in
the second game of the girls‘ illtere
class series Wednesday afternoon in
the Rand gymnasium.

The sophomore team, victors of last
year’s tournament, were not in the
smooth form they displayed last sea-
son, but showed promise of equaling
their former excellence later in the
year. The seniors lacked the starr-
ing material of the sophomores but
partially made up their lack by show
ing unexpected fight.

After the usual first few minutes or
ragged play the sophomores snapped
into teamwork, but work at center
was weakened by poor guarding. The
senior forwards succeeded in overcome
ing the sophomore lead until the last
minute of the first half, when the
score stood at s to 7 in the sophomore
favor.

Sophomore tealllrwork rounded into
splendid form in the second hall. Sev-
eral combinations at forward were
tried, each of which cluded the senior
guards. Play was almost entirely
confined to the sophomore end ot the
floor, the seniors being unable to score
during the entire half. The game
ended with the score at 15 to 7.

The dozen dormitory basketball
teanis all swing into action this after
noon, in what promises to he one of
the best intro—mural series in his-
tory,

Practically every building has
strong teams in the field, although
their comparative strc‘ngtb can not be
determined until after the first round
is over. at least. Langan and Smith
halls clash in the opening games, and
as tar as can be judged from advance
dope, Langan should win at least one
of the two games. Smith’s best bet
is Bradstreet. one of the high scoi-crs
of the race last season, but outside of
this one man, their strength is undeter-
mined, Langan is handicapped by
having more men than usual out for
freshman and varsity basketball, al~
though they have a large number of
freshman who should make good ma-
terial. and unless Smith hall shows
ullexpcctet strength, the Building one
men will not win more than one of
the two games.

in all probab ty, Building Three
will have no difficulty in taking two
games from Building Four, as the lat—
te'r hall has lost most of its last year's
team. and will have to depend entire~
ly upon new men. Although Taylor will
be missed on the Building Three
squad, nevertheless that ball will be
represented by some pmtly good court
men. Nihlo, ail-class center this
year is one of the best, and Gates.
Newlon, Weitz, and McCarty are as
good players as will be seen in the
series

Probably the closest and hardest
fought games of the afternoon will bu
those scheduled last, between Dibblu
and Clark halls. Both buildings a1-
wsys have good teams in the field, and
this year seems to be no exception.
McClain, lioycr, Kingcry. Bunnell,
Carl, and Evahn are some of Clark
best men, while Dibble has Sweet.
McLain, Nicolet, Cathcart, ltinefort,
Duke, carbart and Bradbury. on pa—
per the Dibble team appears to have
the edge, and if the men can play to~
gether, they have a chance to cop two
games from Clark hall.

The three balls that appear the
strongest before the series begins are
Clark, Building Three, and Dibble, and
these three should be well up among
the leaders at the end of the race.

James Fitz is now corresponding with

The Stircwsbury club is one of the

it is largely on the merit of theirl

playing down at Kit-lrsville, Missouri

A New York student attending the
Kirksvitle School or Osteopathy was
so favorably impressed with their
style of harmony that he immediately
wrote to Fitz explaining the opportun-
ity at the Shrewsbury club.

Another possibility for the screnar

Cunnard liners operating between New

definite has been decided on either of
these propositions.

med the Pioneer basketball team. 19
to 18, at Des ltIoincs last night in one
or the most exciting games ever seen
all the Colcsium floor.

With Grinnell leading. 18 to 15, and
six minutes left to play, Sloan was
substituted for Muntz, and made is
pretty underhand shot around the‘ foul
line ,aad alter a short rest Mantz was
sent back in to score the winning gosl
from about the same place.

In the first half, me playing of both
teams was er attic and nervous, and
the Pioneers were unable to solve the
Drake man—for—msn defense, failing to
score a single ticld goal in the entire
period, while Drake penetrated the
Scarlet and Black defense for several
baskets,

Gelvill Starts Scoring

Captain Celvin started the scoring
with a free throw, and Moran followed
with another. Everett then made a
basket on a followup shot, and Ash-
by and Marta followed with free
throws, b inging the count, 4 to 2. lim-
an made two free throws good, and
Ashby then dribbled down the side of
the tlcor and made a long shot. Everett
added another free throw which ended
the scoring for the half; with the score
7 to i in Drake's favor.

Changing their style of offense to a
longer passing game, the Pioneers at!
tempted to comback after Chase miss-
cd a similar try, and huge knotted the
count with a beautiful overhead shot.
Pivotiiig nicely, "Hap Moran slipped
away from the Bulldog guards. and
put Grinncll in the lead with a pretty
shot, but a few seconds later Everett
evened things up with an easy goal
after his team mates had worked the
ball down the iloor. A few minutes .
later the Drake ace added another goal
with a long shot, but Boge again tied
the score at 11 all, when be tipped the
bail in from the foul line.

Sloan Rallies Rivals

Mantz was the next to break the tie
with a goal from the side, but the Pio<
neers forged ahead when Moran made
good, three out of four trials from the
free throw line, followed by a sensa-
tional side shot. Muntz added an-
other point via the free throw route,
and Gelvin flribhleli through the Drake
defense for another goal, bringing the
count 18 to 15 with the Pioneers in
the lead. Sloan was then sent in
and he started the rally that won the
game for Drake. In the last two
minutes, the Bulldogs successfully
worked the old stall game, and the
Grinnell cagers had to be content with
a row long shots which went wild. ,

Moran was the high scorer of the
game with two field goals and seven
free throws for a total of eleven points,
but Everett. Drake's star forward was
close behind with three tield goals
and as many free throws. Captain
Gclvin and Moran wero the outstand-
