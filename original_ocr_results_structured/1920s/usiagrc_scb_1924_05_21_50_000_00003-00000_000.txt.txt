Wilson Declares Thai. Germany 15
Being Asked to Do the
Impossible. '

, "Diplomats at the outbreak or the
war said that whoever won
the war, Austria would lose, and
whoever lost, Japan would will,” was
the telling remhrk with which Prof:
George Gralton Wilson preiaced his
lecture on "Recent International Read-
iustnients" at chapel Monday morn-
ing.

“However far-sighted the prophecies
of the diplomats were, no one antic»
pated the terror of the physical iorce
that was to reign for ten years, or
The lack of respect for civilized insti-
tutiolls."

Mr. Wilson reviewed the tourteen
points or the armistice and pointed out
how restored Poland and united Italy
are practically the only projects of
the entire fourteen which have been
satislactorily realized. "what ‘has

' been accomplished has come about in
spite of, and not because of,tlre na-
tions that signed the armistice. Dur-
ing the war, all worked together for
a common end. Since, each nation
has pulled for herself,"

Big Twenty Became Big Two

Mr. Wilson vividly depicted how the
five great powers drew up the 440 ar-
ticles of the peace treaty, “The Big
Twenty worked together until it was
found too awkward and was reduced
to the Big Ten. It in time,,becarue
the Big Five. One nation got what
it wanted and left the Big Four. One
of the Big Four didn't get what it
wanted, and left the Big Three. One
went home and leit the Big Two,
Lloyd George and Clemenceau, to com—
plete the treaty."

”Nelle of them considered the best
interests of the world. Recently,
Lloyd George published a, book en-
titled Where Are We Going? He
should have asked that earlier. The
Italian minister named his book 'The
.Wreck of_Europe,’ yet he did nothing

, to prevent the wreck. Another or
the delegates calls his hook ‘Wﬁlither'
and still another The Dark Outlook.”

"The peace was regarded by all who
didn't read it as just what the world
needed, TheSenate usually read as
far as Article 10," .ltr. Wilson c0m~
nlained.

In his review of the tcrms of the
treaty, llr. Wilson pointed out how
Germany, although drained of all her-
resources, is still expected to make
enormous reparations. -

Inuit lle Fol- Germany

“Germany is asked to do the imr
possible. Gcrrnrrus have to work tor
a living even in times of peace. A
country three times the arca ot Iowa
with twenty~four times its population,
is expected to assume the entire re—
sponsibility of the war."

Besides a shift of colonial po
sions and the rise of the new states
in Europe, the war has wrought other
impormnt changes. The economic
center of the world has changed trom
London to New York. Republics have
taken the place of morrarchies, and
the monarchies that still exist are
such in nam‘q only. The Council of
Ambassadors, the successor to the
Supreme War Council, a body having
no ccnrrccticn with the League, is 2th
ministrating the peace treaty. The
League of Nations and the World
Court have become lmpormnt in world
politics. ,

Mr. Wilson says or the League, “It
is one or the few stah

s.

{the world today."

"The International Court of Justice
has settled as many disputes dul‘ug
its brief existence, as the U. S. Su-
preme Court has in three times the
length of time. All its decisions are
being observed."

Mr. Wilson concluded his lecture
with a. saying of Juubél't, the French
philosopher, "Might and Right rule
the world, Might until Right is
Ready.”

Reporter Reveals New
Statistics on the
Grinnell Type.

What is the Grinncll student? Does
he speak French or Latin, does he
revel in cosines or electrons, is his
native habitat the music hall or the
"bot” garden? Who is this elusive
creature, the so-called “typical Stu»
den who is famous in myth and song
as representing our true collective
sell?

Your inquiring and ever alert rec
porter, pondering on the inscrutabiiity
of these matter-s. inadvertently poked
his head into the registrar's oitice, a
few days since, in quest of elusive
news. Suddenly he spied a large p

other than a tabulation of the regis»

tion, perhaps, but nevertheless approx—
imately correct,

Seizing his pen, lie wrinkled his
brow, did some lightning calculating,
and learned that the "typical" student

tion, business administration, and my

time, in varying proportions, is divided
among the remaining suubjects of the
curriculum. ‘
