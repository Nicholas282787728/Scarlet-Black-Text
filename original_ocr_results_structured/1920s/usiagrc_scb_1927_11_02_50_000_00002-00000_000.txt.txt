VARIETY.

Fortunately the lecture course is not yet fully ar-
ranged so that a plea for variety will not he too late.
Much as we are interested in political economy, social
reform, religion, etc., we are well supplied with informa-
tion through class rooms. Grinnell has always empha—
sized the importance of these fields; there are few classes
in which they are not, at some time or another, covered
directly or indirectly. Very adequately, likewise. So
that, when a lecture course is presented [or our attendr
ance, we are more pleased to find something which our
classes do not attempt to treat.

mono. Cnhb. .29

Yes, a lecture on political economy by a wellrkuuwh
leader is very valuable, we all concede that; yet we are
at full liberty to read the man's views in newspaper, book,
or magazine. 'Only those interested would attend the lec~
ture anyway; most lilrely they will read, if they haven't
done so, the article or whatever it may he. Also, every
one is willing to hear two or three of this sort of

addresses a year, But in the other two Ol‘ three, we would

like a little variety

One year a gentleman i-cad Pickwick to us; a coler
bi-ntou actor i-eininisced for us once; a young lady has
twice given us monologues. \Ve have had explorers, E
we're starting ollt with one. There is little enough
chance for us to hear them anyway, oi-innoll bcing sol-
dom honored by others than those on the lcctin-c and
recital courses. Consequently, we really need variety.
The music department. in its recital schedule, is very
careful to select from several fields of music. So should
the liberal arts college. in fact, bciug liberal arts, it
ought to have a wide sclection. The more different tier
pai-tinents are represented, the better.

Thus, besides our first lecturer, we might have, say,
a reader, an artist, a religious leader, an author, a soc-
iologist, and perhaps a botanist. Variety is inorc inter-
esting than monotony.'

PROF SIONAL I. ING. ‘

A recent article in the TANAGER actively attacks
the tabloid newspaper, but it might as well have attacked
the “true story" type of magazine, the pseudo-scientific
work, and the "Came the dawn—" sort of fiction. All
three of these come into the class of professional lying.

We are apt to think of confidence men and their aSr
socihtes as professional liars. Yet the writers of the
above are just as much confidence men, [or they are
tricking the public into paying something for nothing,
Nothing—absolutely nothing! They write neither truth,
iwliich, if it were told, would reveal a fat, haldrheaded
fellow in search of easy money as the author of "the
poor girl’s bitter tale of wronged iiinoconceI'Lnor
science, nor even good fiction, Since fiction has some
style and no pretensions for purposes of deception. The
Victorian' novels were better reading and the melodrama
certainly is. v

There is a slur on the character of anyone who reads
this stuff and nonsense. Not that the hoolrs and magar
zines are dangerous to us; they are absurd, inanc,
idiotic. A sense of humor should keep us from them and,
it not that, then a dislike of being ridiculed.

Especially is the “true story" to he laughed out oi
court. To begin with, it is anything but true in nine
cases out often; it possesses no literary value: and each
resembles the next with an insufterahlc monotony. The
pseudo-scientiﬁc work is less easy to eliminate. It has
a slight claim on the truth, and it exists because of fail-
ure of our educational system to cope with the situa-
tion. In other works, our public education must treat
of the theme of all these books, namely sex, so that there
will he no demand for them. As to the cheap novel, the
best cure is again ridicule, It is foolishness for any sane
person to swallow such trash; the fact that apparently
sane people do points to a lack somewhere. And so long
as ﬁsh bite, anglers will give them something to bite on

or course Grinnell is free from all such tolly. It we
aren't his Satanic Majesty deserves several good laughs
at our expense.

which he attended at lielsingfors, 1?an
land, in 1926, at the last open meeting
of the Cosmopolitan club before the
election of new members.

“The experience at living for six
days with poi-sons from ﬁftyrtwo ditr
lcl'ellt countries save us a new atti-
tude of good will and fellowship,”
Keztlillg said. This attitude, he felt,
was thc valuable contribution of the
conicrencc. A southern boy with a
violent prejudice against negrocs on
the way to the conference, was lfcnl—
ing's good friend on the journey home.

The ﬁre of international friendship
was one of the high points of the six
days. The groups from the different
countries came marching to the ﬁre,
singing their own national songs, and
each one laid an oifering symbolic or
its country upon the flames.
