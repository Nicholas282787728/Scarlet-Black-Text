Two Thousand Concerts of
Chamber Music.

QUARTET IS WORLD FAMOUS

Works of Beethoven and Mozart
Included On Program To
Be Given Tonight.

Appearing in a farewell series of
concerts after twenty-five years spent
on the American concert platform in
developing chamber music, the Fion-
,zaley string quartet will play tonight
for a Griunell audience in Herrick
chapel at eight n'clock, Semester fees
will admit

1n the past quarter-century, the
group has given over two thousand
concerts, both in America And
abroad. Each season it is forced to
decline nearly as many engagements
as it accepts, for the organization has
a rule that as much time is to be de-
voted to rehearsals as to public per-
fol-nuances,

Of the personnel of the original
uuartet, three members still remain.
These are Adolfo Betti, first violin,
Alfred Pochon, second violin, and
lwan d’Archamheau, violincello, while
the fourth member of the present
group has been added since the World
War. He is Nicolas Moldavdn, who
plays the viola.

Coordination is Feature

In this country, the name ”Flim-
zaley" is inseparathly connected with
the growth of chamber music, for at
the time when the organization he»
gan, few people were interested in
this form of musical art, whereas
now, largely through the efforts of
these artists, chamber music has been
perfected as an art.

Last season the quartet played in
eighty—nine concerts in the United
states, and this season makes its
eighth visit to the Pacific coast.
James Gibbons Huneker, the eminent
critic, once said of the F'lonzaleys.
"They play more like angels than
men." Many cities apparently relish
these heavenly visits, for once heard
in a city they are invariably wanted
again.

The outstanding feature of the
quartets performance is probably the
complete co-ordination of each mu
eician's performance with those of the
rest of the group, so that when they
are playing the tones appear to come
as from a single instrument.

one could not help talking of many

twinkle in his eye. “We don't know
cvcr.thing about our world yet. We
can learn a great deal about future

fly over thc Polar regions in a dirig

understanding and that any disputc

Explorer Believes War Means
‘ ‘Siirvival 0f Unfittest ; "
Praises League.

"Nothing in the world at present
is more important than to avoid un-
olbcr war," declared Fridta'olf Nan-
seu, distinguished Norwegian explor—
er and statesman, in speaking on
“How Shall We Attain World Peace"
at Hcrrick chapel Monday evening.

Dr. Nansen urged the policy of the
League of Nations, and the disalm~
ing of people’s minds as the means
of uttaing world peace

“If we can get rid of the burden
of armaments we shall quickly get
social reforms," he stated. "If we do
not get rid of war altogether, there
will he no reform and no progress.
in the future as in the past arma-
ments will bring counter armaments
and suspicion, loading at last and ins
evitabiy to e great world war.

Race In hunger

“Another war as bad as the last one
will wipe out our civilization. Anoth—
er such shock will mean the end of
the white race, We have a sense of
struggle and power and a great fu~
ture ahead; but over and over again
in history great civilizations have
been wipcd out.

“Modern Warfare,” Dr. Nansen
said, "means simply the sin ival of
the unfittest. 1n the last war, four
i‘nillion splendid young men from the
United Statcs went to the trenches
and were exposed to the greatest
danger and hardship, while the mil-
lion unfit were left at home to props
agate the race.

"What is achieved by with?" Dr.
Nansen queried, "The world war was
to end war but there is more money
spent on armaments now than in the
last year before the World war.” Dr.
Nausen's hope is in the fact that we
need not have war “War is not a
catastrophe of nature; it is a catas-
trophe of the human will," he said.
"We need no war unless we want it.
