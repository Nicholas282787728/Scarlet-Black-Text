IS IT FAIRY
How many of us iowans ever stop—
pad to criticize ourselves from a gen-
eral point of View? And if we have
what conclusions did we‘ reach con-
cerning our social, political and cul-
tural status in comparison with that
of other states? Are we shallow,
materiel boasters thinking only oi the
rating at our state according to sm-
tistics as to the number of schools
we have, the number of representa-
tives in ,“W‘ho’s who," the number or
hogs we raise and the amount of cats

that come to mind when we are not
distinctly thinking 0! the economic
and egotistical sides.

But these are just the things many
people throughout the United States
are going to think of Iowans when
they read the current issue of "The

.Natlon, Johan J. smertenko. author
of the article. “Iowa: A Mortgaged

Eldorado," has painted a. picture of
the state in which all of its worst
features are heightened grossly while

the few worthy features which he has .

mentioned are pushed sligbtingly in—
to the background. Though some of
the criticism is only [00 true, the
general impression created is scarce~
ly fair.

Two paragraphs from the article
are particularly illustrative of the
opinion he heaps up or lowans and of
IOWA in general:

“Cultural tradition and leisure are

necessary to the making of gentle
man. The ﬁrst Iowans do not poss—

ess; neither can they develop it, ln-‘

asmuch as the second is contrary to
all their standards of living. He who
has met the pathetic. putteriug creat—
ures known as retired Iowa farmers,
or retired lawn anything, with their
tool sheds and truck gardens, their
bees and Fords, their incomplete real-
, estate deals and their worthless auc—
tion bargains, will thereattcr find
cosmic disturbance in the flutter of
a. leaf and universal significance in
the movements of an ant. Yet this is
all the leisure they know in “Ioway,”
and even this is reserved by public
opinion for those who are on the
grayer side of Sixty.

“The result has been justly called
a dull gray monotone. With the ex-
ceptions of a thinly disguised im-

morality and a 59mm“ “mm“ 31' advantage of this opportunity to ful'-‘

filiation, rural Iowa—more than
million souls—has no interests be-
yond bread and butter. The movie
and the pool room, the church social
and the high school entertainment are
the amusements of town life. And the
sophisticated city has its stock-oom-
pany comedies, its lodges, its card
parties, and its dances. There is

CHARLES E. PAYNE l
Charles Edward Payne is a native
of Canada, He received his early edu»
cation in Detroit, Mich, and in Terl'el
Haute. 1nd. In 1904 he graduated
from lndlana University. He was an
assistant in the history department
there in 1904 and 1905 and received
his A. M. degree. During the follow—
ing year, he had a. fellowship at Har-
vard. For one year he was superin—
tendent or schools in northern lu—
diana and in 1907 came to Grinncll
as an instructor in history. Six years
ago he was made a professor of
European history.

Mr. Payne was a delegate from
Grinnell to the Pan—American Cone
grass in 1914. He visited Europe duh‘
ing the summers of 1911 and 1921.
While on leave of absence three years
ago he studied at Harvard for a year
and this last summer studied at the
Williamstown School of Politics in
Massachusetts. Mr. Payne ls a mem-
ber of the American History Assoclar‘
tion, of Phi Beta Kappa ,and of the
English speaking Union. With Mr.
Lovell, Mr. Payne is the joint authol“
of "Imperial England.” He has also.
at different times written on current
questions for magazines.

“One of my chief interests,” says
Professor Payne, "ls, so \far as i can,
to carry on the work or Professor
Macy in interpreting England to
America and promoting understand—
ing between the two peoples. The
British commonwealth of Nations and,
the United States, despite their de-
recto, consh'tute the two most hope—,
ful experiments in democmry today.‘

The entire plans have not been

will be given a chance in discussing

Miss Luella J. Head will give the
