Date for Appeal Set for March-—
Ask Money and Grain For
Famine Sufferens.

Last week in the office of the Sc—
cial Service League an organization
was set up the cooperate with the
American Committee for Russian
Famine Relief in a Famine Week when
solicitations would' he made for funds
and grains, to be sent to assist in re~
liering the famine conditions which
are cal-lying oil the people by the
thousands. Farmers will he called
upon to make donations of corn, wheat
or oats. No shipments of whole grain
will he made to Russia. The corn
and other grain donated will be sold
thereof together
with direct contributions of money
will be used to purchase flour,and
medical supplies for shipment to the
Russian Red Cross. These iiour and
medical supplies are the drst needs
to be met by the American committee.
Later, as funds permit, purchases of
other food products, notably condensed
milk will he made, and ﬁnally cloth-
ing. The distribution of supplies for
famine sufferers by the Russian Red
Cross under American supervision,
will cut overhead costs to the mini-
mum. The Russian Red Cross has
agents in the famine districts un<
touched by other relief organizations;
they speak the language of the coun-
try, understand the situation thor-
oughly and administer relief accord—
ding to certification oi the interna-
tional conference of the Red Cross in
Geneva last October without distinc—
tion as to sex, faith or political opin-
ion.

The appeal for funds will he made
simultaneously in all the states of the
Ohio, Missouri and Mississippi valleys.
it was expected to be next week but
the difficulties of organization and
other matters have compelled delay
until some time early in March. How—
ever, Griunell is ready to go ’at it
when the word comes. Grinnell Com-
mittee for Russian Relief.

Death of Viscount
Bryce Is Felt Here

In the death of Viscount Bryce Grin-
Inell College feels a distinctly personal
sense of loss A long and intimate
friendship a sled between Lord Bryce
and Prof. Macy, and as its result the
College was proud to welcome and ens
tertain Prof. Macy's friend as its dis—

count Bryce’s family in England:
"The news of the death of Viscount
Bryce has brought to the members of
the Facility oi Grillnell College a pro-
louhd sense of irreparable loss. We
have honored him for many years as
the toremost publicist of the English
speaking world. We were not biased,
we believe, by his peculiar interest in
things Ameiican or by the sympathetic
interpretation of the American Com-
monweulth that made ‘him, to all of us,
a citizen not only o: Great Britain,
but of the United states. The honor
we render him would have been no
less, morever, ii we had not had a
valued personal contact with him
through his long triendship with our
companion and teacher, Jesse Macy.
But these things do add, nevertheless,
to‘ our reverence for his genius and
character a certain warmth and sense
of comradeship that cause us to
mourn his loss no less as a friend than
as a great and inspiring leader. It
is, indeed, with mingled feelings of
sorrow and rejoicing that we contem-
plate his passing,‘sorrow that the
world has lost so great a scholar, so
eminent a statesman, so sane a leader,
and rejoicing that the call of death
did not come until he had lived a long
life of fruitful labor and distinguished
achievement iGrinnell and You.
