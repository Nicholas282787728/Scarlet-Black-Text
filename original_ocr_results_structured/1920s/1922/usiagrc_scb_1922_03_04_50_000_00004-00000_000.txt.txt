Pioneers Meet Amos Tonight. And
Drake Tuesday—Both Games
Expected To Be Hard.

Only two more games are left to
be played on the Pioneer schedule,
both of them being away from home,
both state games. and both with
of GrinncllIs most ancient rivals—
Aines and Drake. The first of the two
contests will be against Amos at
Ames tomght, the second with Ul‘uliet

'u

. will be played next Tuesday at Des

iloincs.

in spite of their hard galne‘ last
night the Pioneers seemed to collie our
of the game almost unscdtclicll any
should be in good fighting trim when
they meet the Cyclones tonight. it is
probable that Coach Sounder, will be-
gin with the some lincellp that he
used against the Fibers last night,
Before last nightIs game it was doubts
ini it Benz would be able to even Wolk
through the entire game against
Washington because of a weak ankle
which has bothered him considerably
especially during the past Week. But
after going through that gamc in ﬁne
shcpe' it is now hoped that be will be
able to take his place in the line~up
to-night.

Afer last nights demonstration to
both themselves and their ,foliowcrs
that they could really win games,
predict that the Pioneers have n good
chance to win from the Cyclones to—
night. it certainly seems that the Cy-
clones will meet a. different tenin‘ [0‘
night than the one which only made
against tbem when
Amos played here a short time ago,
and it seems exceedingly doubtful if
the team which made 41 points last
night will be held to such a low
Score again.

Aines has won seven games so far
this season, two against 'he licnsas
Aggies and Washington and one each
.against Grinneli, Nebraska, and Ok-
Ilaﬁoma, Out of eight games played
Iaway from home the Cyclones have
Iwon ﬁve contests but on their home
Itloor have only succeeded in winning
Iiwo out of seven, those two being

ington whom they defeated 32 to 1.7
