When one recalls the ridicule with

which the Tribune treated the very
similar slogan upon which Wilson
was reelected president, it would
seem a complete reversal of policy.
Upon the surface this statement seems
rather contradictory, but upon a clos-
er analysis of the situation they are-
almost indentical.

The Tribune was very strongly in
favor of our eal'ly cnkry into the war.
and when we did ﬁnally enter the
war, she pictured Uncle Sam playing
the part of the Good Samarltan to
the rest of “the world. Playing the
Good Samaritan in War times is very
easy compared to, doing a similar act
in peace times,’ which have a tendency
to be troublesome. The glory and
glduiol' connected with war make it
easy to arouse a nation to a wooden.
ful display of energy for the effncing
of Wrongs inflicted by some nation.
The United States played n, glorious
part in the recent war. She did play
the Gooti Samaritan to an amazing de~
gree and won the admiration and re-
spect of the world. ,
