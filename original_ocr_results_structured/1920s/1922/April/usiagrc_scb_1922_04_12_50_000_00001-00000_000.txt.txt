The Festival promises to he the best

in the history of the college. The Glee ’

club and Vesper Choir are well known
and While the St. Louis Symphony Oi"
chesti'a is new to Gl'innell audiences,
the leader, Rudolph Canz, has appea
cd here and has been very popula.
He passed through the phases of prod
igy, teacher, conceit virtuoso and colli-
posel‘ and reaches the summit CE The
terpretative musicianship as leader of
this organization which. is one with a
long and ‘splendld history. it is the
costliest event of ,any kind that has
ever, been brought to Grinnell,

In speaking of the plans for the [es-
tival this year, Prof, H. \l’. Matlack,
of the Music Festival Association,
said:

“Probably no student body in the
United States turns out better to mus-
lca.l events than the student body of
Grinncll college, and yet there are a
good many of us who are undermined
as in whether or not we will get four
dollars worth or enjoyment out of the
Music Festival. Those who remember
the Festival of two years ago have
no doubt on this point, but there are
a lot of student here now who never
heard a Symphony Orchestra, and
who have no idea of what it is, nor
what to expect. it is no disparaging
oi other .muslcal cftoirs that‘appeai-
in Herrick Chapel to say that the two
concerts to be given by the St. Louis
Symphony Orchestra next Monday
threw all other musical events of the
last two years completely into the
background, tor not only is this or-
ohestra, with its ﬁfty artis performers
led by the famous compose ~conducs
tor Rudolph Ganz the largest come
pany of artists that has ever come to
Grinnell, but the kind of music it pi- ,
sents, and the way in which it pl -
cents it, cannot be compared with any
.thing else in the whole world of mus—
ic. .

"The music produced by a symphony
orchestra of the highest class is the
sum total of all the inds of musical
expression that mankind has achieved.
There is no tonal effect, no shade of
expression, an unusual quality of
tenccolor, no tantalizing complexity
of rhythm, that is not found in the
combination of instruments that form
the orchestra. It can play military
music like a brass band—it can 'azz
to beat the six Br wn Brothers. It
can play a dozen violin solos at once,
and give them an accompaniment of
harp, ilutes, oboes, French horns, Engs
lish horns, kettle drums, cloriuets,
bassoons, and all the rest. Then each
of these can play solos, and let the
others take their turn at accompanh
ment, and the combination of effects
in tone color attorded by these dfty
instruments makes possible an ever-
shilting tapestry of tone that yields
an experience absolutely (unique.

“Symphony orchestras e.\ st because
they provide the most interesting, the
most entertaining, and the most in-
spiring, music that man has been able
to conceive. Their music must be en»
tci-taining and interesting, because
the expense of maintaining an orches-
tra is so great that it must appeal to
the general public to support it, and
the public supports only what it likes.
and not what is good for it. oi-chcs-
tral music, therefore, has developed
