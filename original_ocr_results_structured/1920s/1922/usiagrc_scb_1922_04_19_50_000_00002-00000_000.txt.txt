Now that the question of sub rosa
fraternal'organizfttions is up for dis
cussion, the next thing is to give a
little thought to a possible solution.
This is advisable for tivo reasons: in
the ﬁrst place it will serve to throw
additional light on the situation and
its possihilities and may be an induce-
ment for a broader discussion of the
matter; and in the second place, there
is little doubt as to the stigma at—
tached to such groups and the ﬁrst
consideration, then, is to decide what
to do with the offenders.

The secrecy supposed to surround
the organization in tlic dormitories
has not been maintained and there is
little doubt as to the membership of
the group that has been the cause of
the present discussion. Since the ruys
ter-y and glamour have departed, the
only things remaining are fraternity
papers and pins, and until they, too,
are reproved‘froiu their present keep-
ing place, any solution of the problem
as has been
proven by past experience. The so-
lution, then, would seem to be this:

L0 cull rip the student members of the

them the books which have accumu»
lated during the career of the organr
zation. Then, in addition to whatever
penalty the faculty shall wish to in—
dict, have each member sign a pledge
that he is no longer affiliated with the
organization and will not reassociate
with it while he remains in Grinnell
college.

or course, there is always the pos—
sihilitv—even the probabilityeof the
members claiming that they are dis-
solved. ‘This may he tine at the mo—
ment—some byrldws are provided to
deal with such exigencies—but it is
not fundamentally true. The mem—
bers are hound together and can re-
associate at will, if they are not curb-
ed.

—that remains for the author
decide—but it is prcsented as on
incihod of dealing with a question
that has been cropping out contin-
iiiillly, not only here but in other col-
leges. Whatever course is taken, and
{there can he little doubt that some-
‘tllillg should be done, the resulting
action should he of a type to cope with

SECRET FRATS

The Scarlet and Black last Satur-
day says that Grinnell College is can»
fronted with the problem of dealing
with a few secret fraternities, The

over the announcement. except to
speculate as to their future and the

Again, it may he claimed that the
papers of the group are already dc-
stroyed. Once more, this may be true
at the moment, but the papers so de-
stroyed, such as rituals, are those
which are ﬁxed in the memories of
the older members of the group and
can be rehabilitated at will.

In either case, such claims would
show a disposition to dodge the issue
and to try to cover up the organiza-
tion and the activities of the chapter.
in either case, the mere statement of
dissolution is not enough. However,
the demand for a signed statement rev
garding secret fraternal organiza-
tions would place the stndcnt on in

members of the present chapter should
refuse to adopt the pledge, then fac-

Is wllat every ambitious senior is

Life insurance is one of the best, one

In assets and volume of business,
life insurance is one of the three lead-
