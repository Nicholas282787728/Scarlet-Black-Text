President Alexander Meikleiohn of

C
THE MALTEASER.

Four years ago the Malteaser was

started by the local chapter or tile“

Sigma Delta Chi. It. began as It strict-
1y humorous publication, and it hits
remained essentially humorous. It has
occasionally branched into the literary
when it has printed tabloid book re-
views and articles such as the re—
cent one by Sir Philip Gibbs.

The Malteaser has grown from a.
publication issued four times 3. year-
to one issued eight times a year. For
this reason it has grown increasing—
ly diilicult to ohtain enough good
humor to ﬁll the magazine. Criticism
has come from tWO different groups.
Some students believe that it doesn’t
have enough "kick".

To lie perfectly candid, The Illitl—
teaser would have a larger sale and
would be more successful ﬁnancially
if it lowered itself t0 the publication
of the Class of Smut annealing in
some college comics. This may be a
condemnation of the good taste of
college students, but. We believe it (0
be true. We have 9. very gnarl example
of this in one of the issues of the
"Sour Owl" lztst- year, published at
the University Of Kansas. The maga-
zine was losing money on every is
she. The editor became desperate and

dually let down the bars and puh~_

lished material in one issue which he
admits was downright smut. As a. re-
sult theyt had to run oil'sn extra edl<
tion on the Drass and that one issue
made three hundred and tiny dollars.

The management oi the Melteaser
has no intention ol meeting this kind
or demand. The public doesn-t always
Want What is best for iti The editors
of the magazine believe that in the
long run the readers will he much
better satisﬁed if they are given the
highest class of humor, but in a. Small
colleg‘e this is hard to ﬁnd in large
quantlties.

The other group from which the
Malteaser
criticism is composed of alumni and

management has received

college protessors who can see little
in the magazine that is original or
that is exceedingly runny. Whether or
not this criticism is justiﬁed is not
tor us to judge.

The problem ’is to ineet, so far as

lis possible, this. dual criticism. and atl

the same time put out a magazine that
will be a credit to Grinnell college as

well as a ﬁnancial success. This brings r

us to the thesis which‘we wish to pre—
sent. The Malteaser must, it it con-
tlnues to grow, take on more of the
character or a college magazine, cams
pining the virtues or a magazine, a
comic, and a literary publication. This
is done very successfully at the Uni-
versity oi Minnesota, and there is no
reason why one magazine should not
perform this function at Grinnell. in
order to accomplish this end it would
be necessary for Verso'and Fiction to

WILLIAM r BRIDGE

William l-l. Bridge was born and
educated in London. After his grad-
uation from the Bruce Grove School
of Science and Art, he went into busi-
ness and, at the same time. prepared
himself ior matriculation in a univer-
sity. in this preparation, while also

ﬁrst to Kings College in London for a
short time, then to Durham Univer-
sity. Here he first obtained a degree
in divinity and iollowed it with a lilr
oral arts course at the same univer—
sity.

Mr Bridge started his ministerial
work in London and later continued
it in a large, miuinc camp in northern
England. His interests at that time
were largely sociological; he was
drawn into close contact with the
labor and industrial problems of the
mining camp. a large industrial tens
ter. Mr. Bridge broke through all the
traditions of bis’positicn by jumping
,lnto politics and taking the chair at
,political meetings at the time of the
election which resulted in Mr. Lloyd
George's ﬁrst Parcliament Although
:thitt brought upon him a certain
amount oi odium, it did not prevent
his obtaining a position In the im-
portitnt church of st. 'John's on
Princess street Edinburgh. Here he
was brought into contact’wlth exactly

and cold Sootcluneu. Whille he was
there he worked with the British
Empire Shakespere Society and par-
ticularly with Laurence and H. H.
lrving and Frank Benson. He’ ap-
peared with them in plays and read
quite frequently with them. Even
while in the church there he was able
to study the drama and the theater
as well as to do practical Work. He
also studied with Creme Goring, an
actor of many years experience. At

 

this same time he to‘ok an active

The next move made by Mr, Bridge
was to British Columbia where he
taught in King Edward‘s school for
three years and had charge of a large
mission district which covered about
nineteen mission stations. Next gn-
ing to Idaho, he taught in the state

~ and conducted a little
theater in connection with the church
or which he had charge. In 1920 he
came to Grinnell as an assistant pros
fessor of English.

Mr. Bridge says, "The thing i am
particularly interested in here is the
feeling that Grlnnell has (tn (lmml‘

and beauty through the development
later on of a good art school. The
real demand, which we have a unique
oportunlty of filling, is for those
