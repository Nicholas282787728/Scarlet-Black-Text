Delta Phi Rho is not comparable
with any of the honorary organiza-
tions existing at the present time. It

pa. It does not have any professional
standards or requirements or achieve—
ment, as does Sigma. Delta Chi. It is
El thorn in the side of the Honor “G"
Club and prevents the full mnctiuning
of that organization. It wants to take
the place of the Lantei'nibut it fails.

Since the Delta Phi Rho organization
is none of these things and, because
of lts~wculd-he secrecy, it is hampelu
ed somewhat in a social way. How-
ever, it must be something and in
view of its actions and record, it
seems altogether feasible that it noth-
ing more, since the publicity against
it has Started, it is the mouthpiece of
smile mature mind which is hiding
behind a mask of unhclict and using
the organization for personal motives.

THAT FRA’l‘ AGAIX .

Elsewhere iii tilis issue there rin—

poai-s an article relating some of the
experiences of Pomona College with
fraternities and describing the system‘
that they have there. Briefly, this is,
upper-class membership in local or—‘
ganizations. These are recognizéd DY
the faculty and arc a large factor in
the social life of the college. They
are limited to social activities.

An organizationof this type, how—
ever, is vastly different from the or—
ganization that exists among themen
on the local campus. At Fomona, the
fraternities are recognized. At crin—
nell, the members claim that the fac-
ulty know about it. The real truth
is doubtless tilt some few members
of the faculty have heard of it but on
inquiry have been informed that it
does not exist or is not serious. Hav—
ing no occasion to doubt their inform-
‘ei‘s, at that time, they have let the
matter drop However, there is avery
deﬁnite situation here. The SCARLET
AND BLACK is not lighting a man of
straw, as some communications in
this issue testify.

in Grinnell, we have certain recoga
nizcd organizations which are suppos-
ed to handle all necessary matters for
the various activities. They are lion
orary in character eltho something of
the social appears occassionally. They
ago recognized by the faculty andl
sponsored in every possible way in or-
der that they may adequately fill their
respective positions on the campus.
Among these may be named Phl Beta,

Kappa. society and Cap and Gown,10r

Villa‘t Do You Think?

Editor Scar-lot and Black:

Following your invitation for fur
ternity friends to participate in the
discussion which is now going on ic.
gal-ding the Grinnell organizations.
I am forwarding a few of my ideas on
tho subjcct with a view to correcting
some uniust criticisms of thc tpatcr-
nity in Grinneil. It is quite probable
that this will. never be printed since
it doesn’t coincide with your own views
but there will be some satisfaction in
putting your much vaunted open mind-
eduess to the test.

Articles appearing in your paper
have claimed that Delta Phi Rho has
interfered in athletics. Is it reason-
able to suppose that a man playing
for Grinucii would deliberately throw
a. game, particularly to Drake? Your
statement is so far fetched that it is
foolish. Have any of the football men
complained of discrimination and lztck
cf couperationl Why not ﬁnd out the
facts of the case?

And then the statements about the

can it be proven that the Vote Was a
fraternity affair? Was anybody but

grace is there in being elected basket-
ball captain, even if you are a transfer
trom another school? it's foolish to
talk that way.

It's true that the members of the
fraternity have been active this year.
They have had parties at regular in»
tervals and have had somc mighty
good times if you feel that you can
believe‘a supporter of such “Violators

When a few students are willing to

IRISH REPUBLICANS MAKE PRO-
FOSALS

In an cfort to avert a catastrophe
representatives of the regular and ir-
regular branches of the Irish republi—
can army have signed a statement sets
ting forth certain proposals, which
they think will remedy the state of
alfairs. They say that they realize
that, “If the present drift is allowed
to continue a. conflict between com-
rades is inevitable and would be the
greatest calamity of Irish history. It
would leave Ireland broken for gen-
erations." Do Valera still continues
to oppose a vote on the question of the
acceptance or refusal of a peace
treaty.
