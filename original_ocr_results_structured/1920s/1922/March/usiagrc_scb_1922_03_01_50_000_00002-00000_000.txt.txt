WILL WE BE DEFEATEDl

A detected army is one which has

lost everything to its victors. A. de-

'feaieii team is one which quits, lays
down on its job. In both cases the
ﬁghters are licked, down and out.
stripped or all the tinsel and trap—
pings, that go to make a peace hero,
and left destitute, to recover as they
may. And the recovery is the test of
defeat.

This season has not been a par-
ticularly fortunate one for the pion—
eers. in football, we won e few and
lost seversl genres and in basketball
it has been the same way. Grinuell
is at the root of the conference ladder
and yet we are not guilty or laying
down on the job. The team has never
for a minute quit scrapping—altho

the some 0111': always he said or the
_ rooters. Grinnell lights, and has been
lighting continuously thruout the sea—
son. The team has been putting up
some wouderiul games against our op~
ponents and have done their utmost to
place the Pioneers at the top oi the
ladder. The mere ract that they have
been unable to do this is no proot that
they have not taught and should not
be misinterpreted by any or the local
supporters. ‘
‘ There are
games to be played, altho only one
on the home iioor, am] the conduct
and hacking ot the student body dur-
ing the next few days can in a large

yet three Conference

measure determine the outcome and
the ﬁnal count of the local,.tealn at
the end of the season. The Pioneers
have won from one of the teams t

he met in the, next week and has lostl

to the other two by narrow margins.
In every case, the game has been hard
and last and we have always been
proud oi our representatives, always
glad that they are wearing the scar

If Grinuell, as a unit, gets behind the

bashethell men and tries to aid in a

been giving its host and now it's up

COLLEGE

\Vbut is the proper attitude [or It
college student. to lake toward his
school? Shoulrl it be one of unquc -
tioning dccepimlcc of all its doctrln ..
should it. be one of modiﬁed doubt, or
should it he one of honest thinking and
of honest criticism?

We believe that it should be the litt—
tel‘. To accept all the doctrines of an
institution, even one of as high sldnrl»
ards as has Gl'imlcll, is to intinmle
a slipcrﬁciality of thinking and of cone
vicLion that is quite the opposite of the
(thus of the right tvpe of college. Part
of one‘s education is supposed to be
adventures in independent thought and
for a school to preach the latter and
yet denial-ill implicit support of cer-
il’rlll dogmas is fatal.

On the other hand. the student who
is always doubtful concerning the ac»
lions ol the administration, who is
constantly knocking some member of
the college or some principle of it. is
:7. liability. There is nothing COIF
struclive ill continuous knocking for
the mere pleasure of easing Ono's per-
sonal groucbes, and this type of silly
dent has no place in a school such as
our own. He is always hell—hearted
in his support, if his attitude may be
digniﬁed by the title. and he has no
faith in the past of the college or ill
its possibilities for the future.

However, there is a_ real place ill
any college for the honest thinker;
tor the men who sees the limitations
of the school and yet tllrn it all is a.
loyal supporter; {or the man who can
see and analyze the weaknesses of
the school and yet remain temperate
and a booster. The best type or silk
dent is be who can see both the weak
nesses and the strength of the college
and. seeing, realize the exceedingly
Vital part that each member of the ills
stitutien must play, doing his utmost
i0 fulﬁll his own individual responsi-
hilities.

What Do You Think?

Editor Scarlet‘ and Black:

After digesting the vigorous and
miound expostulations which have
ecs‘nily appeared at different times
in the columns of S. and E., I have
come quits deﬁnitely to the conclusion
hat, as usual in such cases, there is
"your side. my side and the right

 

side." A college, high school or any
academic institution has its own code
of living, its own philosophy, tradl-

Herrick

dition which is as it should be, but,
1 rear, one which is liliely to stagnnte
in time if it is not hauled from its
inn y bed and exposed to the unkind
glare or the oumide world.

In other words, I believe that a
Grinnell men, though a i- nk outsider-
so tar as, association with the college
is concerned, who has seen college
students come and go tor the last
score of years and who has noticed
the iraleidoscopic changes which have
taken place in that length oi time, is
perhaps better qualiﬁed to pass judg-
ment on things as they are than even
a senior in the institution, who at
best can look backward only a trifle
more than three years.

And in the past twenty years, much
water has passed under the bridge.
Through all that period, the outstande
ing ideal ct the institution, in its tat
and lean years alike, has been that
intangible, chime cal quality reierred
to as “Gr-innell Spirit." Sojar as def—
iuito substance is concerned, it is per»
hops largely ethereal. but it has exs
listed, and, I ﬁrmly believe, still exists.
But there's a ditference.

in those days, athletics were more
suecesstul than now, judging iroln the
success or the tennis turned out,but al
most invnriehly it was *a case or a
poor team, with a world of. light, heat—
ing or better teem, which lacked the old
right which the Scarlet and Black in—
evitably produced in abundance. Those
of us who remember that in 1908.
Ames’ iootball team beat Grinnell 55
to 0, lost to Cornell 5 to 0, and then
came to Grinneil and saw the Scarlet
and Black triumph over Cornell with
the score or 12 to 11, ﬁnd it difficult
to believe that the Crinnell Spirit
was not a living, vital force in the lite
and character or the college which
produced it.

But that spirit was the result or a
truly democratic form or government,
one in which the individual toeilngs
of the students had tree rein. A man
might play toothall and he popular,
or he might lint play football and be,
perhaps, even more popular, if he had
individual talent or personality sut-
iicient to "put him over."

In other words, to be more speciﬁc,
the trouble, as I view it, is that Grinr
ncll College students are being train—
ed to iit a standard, to eoniorrn with
certain tradiuons which have long out:
lived their usefulness. In order tor a
student to be a big man, in the mod—
ern collegiate sense 0! the word. he
has to “belong." he must have a cer—
tain physical perfection and even
though he has no particular talent or
originality, so long as he is with the

GIBBS WORKS FOR
RUSSIAN RELIEF

Conditiom There Demand Notion
—Sta.rts World Movement.

(From Grinnell Herald)
Sir Phillip Gibbs, the great English,
war correspondent who recently ep-'
pear-ed in Grinnell, returning irom a
tour of the drought regions of R'ls-
sin has written tor the press or Elk
rope and America a series or articles.
it took a men like Gibbs to stir the
war-hardened world to a realization
or the fact that more people are on tbel
verge or death in Russia. irom n: that
than perished oi all nations combined!
during the terrible years oi the var.
So well has Mr. Gibbs performed hist
task and so furoefully has he rallcil
upon the civilized world to realize its,
responsibility that even governments:
are no v being slirred to action. 3
in these articles written by Gibbs‘
he states: "It is unlucky tor 25,000,000 ‘
peasants in southern Russia that they‘
have no food to eat at a time when the i
world is tired or tales or human mise‘
ery, sick or its own troubles, and
busy, with passionate selﬁshness in
trying to Cure its own maladies. Those
Russian peasants have been very un-
lucky. ~ - * i What ever may be the.
past and present crimes or the soviet:
government—and that is outside my
line or inquiryil have absolute evi-
dence that all food sent by British and
American societies, has reached the
famine areas intact, without any rob-i
hery, and with the zealous nssisrunoe'
oi soviet author-lies. ’Jbe American'
reiiei people are sending 1,500 tons a;
week, which is suiticieut to reed nonr-'
ly 1,000,000 children, and they have no
kind or theft or outrage to report." i
Governor N. E. Kendall. and rresi-'
dcnt J. H. T. Main, or Grinneil are on
the national advisory committee or
The American Committee for Russian
Famine Relief which has been organ-
lzed to provide or channel through
which the people of America may aid
inwhat is now a world wide eiiort
to stay the hand of wide spread mis-,
ery and death in the drought stricken
regions oi Russia.
