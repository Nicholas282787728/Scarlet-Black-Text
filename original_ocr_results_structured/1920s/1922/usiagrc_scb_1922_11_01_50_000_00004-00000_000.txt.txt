state should adopt business methods
in the administration or its allairs.
To hasten the return to nonnalcy we
"must restore strict economy, not only
in personal matters, but also in our]
government." Amongtheimprovements
that he intended to advocate, if he.
returned to the state house for an.
other term, which he stated "confi-
dentially" that he was planning to do,
was the “establishment of an cxtenu
sive and competent budget system 4
in which, "no department could ex-
pend over it's allotment" and by
which many agencics or the govern-

this system, he stated, a rendering oi,

would serve to "delay, discredit and‘

Hilarious Girls in
Wild Costumes at
Hallowe’en Party.

Manners and morals and all things
nice but dull were scattered to the
four winds Tuesday night when the
Quadrangle turned out in a hody for
its annual Hallowc'cn spree in the
dining room.

You may think you’re pretty devilr
ish at times, boys, but when it comes
to throwing a big wild pttrty~the,
genuine article, where nothing shocks ‘
and anything pleasesiyou'd better
leave it to the ouadz The ,girls of
Grinnell may sometimes seem to your
sophisticated tastes to be sweet young:
things just out or mother'sarms, but
when they once got going—they’re a
riot!

Costumes last night varied vastly
in regard to color, style and ounnuty. }
Meek young preps (N. B. ivlesnt for
a jolte~there ain't no such ainmall) l
hlcssomed out in alluring Fatimas,
each with a wicked, little siren in her
eye. Dear Rudy—Rudolph Valentino,
you know—appeared in person, and
expressed himselt as delighted with'
the spirit or Gl'innell girls, declaring
that Grinnell and Hollywood have
much in common. And so many rave
ishing bathing beauties were discove
ed among the nests that Mack Sen—

ready on his way to select material
