Y. M. THURSDAY

Says We Celebrate Both Birth of'

Chu'ist and Yule Season.

Professor Lovell, who spoke at the
Y. Mr. C. A. meeting last Thursday
night ,emphasized the signiﬁcance of a
iestivnl celebrating both the birth of
Christ and the old Yuletime season.
The Yule festival, he said, was cele-
hrated by the Norseman long before
the birth of Christ. It was featured
by roaring ﬁres to drive sway the cold,
and the red and green decorations
which ws still use. The red was a
symbol of warmth thut is so welcome
in the winter time, and the green
sprays oz evergreen were the symbol
of the new life that will come to all
living things in the spring.

The old Norseman chose the bleak-
est time of the Year, when everything
seemed dead, to hold a festival which
looked forward to the spring which
Was already on the why. The Christ-
ians have combined this festival with
one celebrating the birth of the Savior.
and we have our Christmas time. It
is a festival of the season End at our
religion. In celebrating it We are
looking forward to a new awakening
of life, both natural and spiritual.

eral other genuine stellar casts; Con~
rad Nagei, a. veteran of de Mllle un-Y
star productions, mid Julia Faye, who
has won high praise for her work in‘
‘sevorsl recent de Mille pictures. i

The story or “Nice People" is a
‘titting vehicle for this galaxy or tel—‘
‘lent. It deals with the problems and
dangers confronting the modern girl
and her “jazz” tendencies. The theme1
is timely and poweriul and the pro~l
duccr has presented it in a. manner
that is certain to entemin the
spectator immensely.

A supporting cast which includes
Claire McDowell, Edward Martluel.
Eve Sothern, Bertram Johns, Wil-
liam Boyd and Ethel Wales equals
the reeord set by the stellar prin—
cipals luv this picture.
