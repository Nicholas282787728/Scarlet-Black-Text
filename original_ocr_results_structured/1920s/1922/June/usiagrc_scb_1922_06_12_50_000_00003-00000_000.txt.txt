Beautiful and suitable music.
strong and vitél address by Dr. E. A.
Steiner and the impressive ritual com-

of unusual appeal to a congregation
which ﬁlled every seat in Horiick
Chapel.

The vcsper choir. us usual, was aug-
mcntcd by a number of resident and
out of town graduate members and
formed a chorus which rendered with
taste, expression and power the Kyrie
and Sahetlis from Council's Sf. Cccclia
mass. These nuluhels are always e
pcctcd at the Commencement Vesper
service And rightly so for they convey
in a manner especially their own the
solsmnity and dignity of the occasion.
The fact that inany young women are
here for the reunion of the Cir-rs Glee
Club made the choir one of especial
excellence this year. The trio in the
Kyr' was sung by Miss Slater and
Messrs. Clovis and Read and Hall Clo-
vis gave the tenor solo in the Sanctus.
Professor Elias Bliim was at the organ
and Miss Sarah MacDonald assisted at
the piano. Professor C. L. Pierce di-
rooted and must have been gratiﬁed
at the manner in which his pupils of
former yccrs remembered his teach-
ings. The choir sang with a precision
and an attention to detail which would
have done credit to a body of singers
who had practiced long together.

We have men of mental power but
that does not suffice. Our big bl'alnea
men are the ones Who have slain mil-
lions of men and left women and chil-
dren to starve. They have led the
world astray and brought civilizouon
to the brink of the grave.

Not 'tlll we have spiritual power
will we have Christian civilization.

Then the settker touched briefly on
the three meoos through which he be-
lieves spiritual power may he attain-

ed, mentioning first the recovery .if_

personality. He said that in our suhr
mergence in the mass inin We have
lost our individuality. We must dare
to he alone Wlth God. We must assert
ourselves above our institutions and
stand ﬁrmly on our own feet.
Another Way to [lower is that of
salt denial. The age is one of search-
ing for the physical Joy of life, As
illustration the Speaker cited the re-

cent pageant on, the campus in which
the young women showed how Com—
pletely the spirit of Greek self ex-
pression through physical grace and
motion and become part of them-f
selves. In finding this joy of life, the‘
speaker thought that we have lost
touch with spiritual things. "Youl
:cannot serve God and liiammon."I
When you choose between Art andl
Morals you must choose Morals if you‘
chose rightly.

Self sacriﬁce was the third and lost
means of Power. There is no way to
the Christ power, said the speaker,
but by way of the contritc heart and
the broken spirit; by offering of our
best upon the alter of life.

"Real growth," said Dr. Steiner in
conclusion, “is struggling from the
beast upward. The giving of oncs
self to the hungry multitude is real
achievement.”
