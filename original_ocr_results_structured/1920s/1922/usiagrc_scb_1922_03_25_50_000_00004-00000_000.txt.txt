oline Sheldon were an the general
prot. George R. Coitinitn
was elected chairman of the English
group at a mating held Friday
afternoon. In addition, Professors
F. F. Almy and D. n. Grillith attend-
ed the meeting. Prolessor Almy is
on the executive committee.

“Chronic listlessness toward educur
tiun is depriving about 20,000,000
children in this cuuntry 0: that mini-
mum of good opportunities which is
clearly their birthright as future
American citizens," declared Dean
Nollen, in speaking on the subject the
teacher as "Mediator Instead of Mold-
er“ of children's Characters. He stres-

America and world relations, deplcr-

700,00utcachers of the United States
have the minimum of training consid-
ered essential to prop ~ 'nstruction of
the children oi the nation.

“This wholesale mental starvation
of our' youth is evidently tar less a
matter at public interest than the la-
test scandal from Hollywood," he said.
In referring to the “pinchback Ameri-
canistn" ot the post war years, he ask-
ed it America had not learned her les-
son from the past seven years.

“It is inconceivable that we should
teach our children an ideal of Amer!-
canism which has tor its highest civic
virtue a. creed Which by implication

ellillg to notice that a newspaper which
published the ﬁnely humorous col-loans
by Jay N. Darling should also produce
the hideous mousti‘osities or the col-
ored comic page that had to be thrown
into the ﬁre, lest they deform the

"One thing is needed to lift the

. pedagog to the level of the teachers,"

be said in sketching his ideal teacher.
"That one thing is the art, or grace,
of mediation. The teacher, like the
musician and the general, is an ar-
tist, master ol the psychological as
well as the mechanical requirements
.01 his calling. He must be more than
a virtuoso. He must mediate to bring
to the child the knowledge ol the ages,
rather than atempt to impress his ver»
sion upon the supposedly'plastiC mind
of the child."
