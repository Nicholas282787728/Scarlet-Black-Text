Hard luck in locating the basket‘
proved to he the stumbling block of
the drinncll quintet in their tilt with
Oklahoma at Norman last Saturday.
This game came as the last of a three
game series which took ‘tlic Pionc'ci-
cagers on a long hard trip at the very
beginning of the season, and was a sc-I
vcro test for them. The ﬁnal score
, was 30 to 20 in favor oi tthSoouers

The team work of the Grinnell
team was far superior to that of the
sooners but, in spite of the fact that
they got three shots to one of the
Oklahoma aggregation, they seemed
unable to score when the opportunity
aiiorded itself. Oklahoma, led by the
Titanic "Ed" Waite, looked like giants
beside the Pioneers whose oiienIsiie
attacks were repeatedly broken up by!
the sheer weight at the Sooner dc-
fence. Fearing was high m'a‘n for-
Grihnell with three ﬁeld goals in his
credit. White was the outstanding
star oi the game, scoring three ﬁeld
’goals and eight free throws out oi oi
possible’twelve.. Benz continued his
good work in dropping in free throwsI
by making six ringers'out of eight at-‘
tempts.

Taken as awhole the contest was a
rather poor exhibition of systematicI
bsskétball, the play usually tending
toward the old style ol.’ individual
work. Locdl' ions are prone to be-
lieve that the Sooncrs will have to
improve considerably it they expect to
make a good showing in their return

The squad is now hard at work in
preparation for the game with Nee
Tll'aska at Lincoln on Saturday. With
decisive'victor s‘over Washington and
Ame: to their credit, the Cornhuskcrs
are looked on ‘aS one 0!; the strongest
teams in the valley circle and are dupv
ed by many to ﬁnish at the top oi the,A
column when the season closes. Con-A
sequeutly, this game will probably bcI
one of the toughest events on the Gun-
nell schedule this year. However,’ thei
Nebraska team has showed itseli to
be chiefly dangerous while playing an
offensive game and ii the Pioneers can
manage to devise an eitcctivc defence

PLACE IN NEWI SYSTEM

Ruling Effective at Once — Puts
Grinnell on Equal Footing
With Valley Schools.

A

A complete revision ol the rules
governing the giving oi Honor ”G's"

has been announced by the Grinnell
athletic committee composed of P10-
fcssors Paul Peck, J. S Rogers, L. V.
IHartson, and H. .i-. Huii When Gill»
IAnell entered the Missouri Vall'cy, no
change in ruling was made from that
of the old lowa conference and this
has caused some difficulties at times,
icspccially when the development of
the various branches of athletics dur-
ing the last few years is taken into
consider-anon. A

Perhaps the greatest change in the
rules tor getting a letter comes in
basket ball: Up to this time letters
Iwei-c given to members of the squad
Awho had played two complete games.
Undel- the new ruling men who play
ten halves will be awarded their mon-
ogram. * This allows for a free sub-
stituItlou of men thioughout the game
and at the some time requires a man
to play in only about one third of the
games. A

in football the new ruling requires
the men to play too major quarters;
Ithat is, to play ten quarters in major
games. Two quarters of aI minor game
may be substituted for one major
quarter but this will be allowed only
twice making it necessary to play at
least eight major quarters to win a
lettcr.

To win a letter in track it is nec-
essary that a mini win one point in a.
Missouri Valley meet, takes a. ﬁrst,
second or third, place in a State meet,
or takes a first place in a dual meet
with any major or out o: the state
school. LeLtel‘s will be given'to the
men composing a relay team if they
place ﬁrst, second or third in a Mis-
souri Valley meet, or second in a
ststd meet. or ﬁrst in the Drake rc- ,
lays.

An entirelyluelv ruling of the com—
niittec is the giving of Ilettel‘s [a
worthy members of the cross country
squad. It has been decided that let-
teis Iin this sport will be giycn to the
IinenAil-ho iinishI within the number of
places corresponding to the number of
teams taking poit in the ion.
This means that it ﬁve vAitenu‘ls
are entered letters ‘will be award-
c‘d to men who i ' any of the ﬁrst
live places. A A

Because or the lack or organization
or tennis as avarsity sport the presA
cnt ruling is rather sti gent. Letters
will be given in this branch only to
those who win a ﬁrst place in the
State or the Missouri Valley tourna—
ments. ,

This revision or the athletic ruling
plus Grinnell requirements for ath-
’lctic honors on a general stand with
all other Missouri valley schools. The
ruling is to go into eficci immediate-

ly.
