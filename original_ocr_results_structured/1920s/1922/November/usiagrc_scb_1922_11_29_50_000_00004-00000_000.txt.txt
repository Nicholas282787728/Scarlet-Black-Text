Address Made Monday Evening;

Auspices of Grinnell Wu- ~
man’s Club.

In his address before a large 3.“le
once at the Congregational church
\laliday evening, Marlin J. Wade, Feds
crztl judge [or the southern district
in Iowa, pleaded for a higher type
of citizenship. A man, who has spent
practically a life—time on the bench
hearing of the mistakes and tragedies
of life, chose to say that while all
was not right, all was not wrong in
America.

The judge used many stories of in-

cidents from his experience as a jur— l

ist, to show why he believed there
was need of an organization to save
America from cermin pen'ls. These
he explained were the growing at
mode or indifference taken by many
citizens toward the responsibilities of
citizenship and government and rrom
the seeds oi dscontent that were be-
ing hroadcasted over the country by
radical agitators. The ﬁrst. or these
incidents that he mentioned was the
recent wholesale mail rohhei-ies un-
earthed at Council Bluffs. Twenty
young men, all of whom had at least
a high» school education and came
from good American homes were
hrought before Judge Wade recently
{or sentence when they pleaded guilty
to rohbing the mails,

One or the most glaring examples
mentioned hy the speaker of the ill~
dlitercnce oi citizens toward their
responsibil es of government was the
tact that only hall of the people or
voting age exercised their right of
sum-age in the 1920 election. He ex-
pressed himself as in favor of a law
that would make the failure to vote
a punishable crime and would moire
election day a national holiday—"a

;day when flags would be flying z‘md
hands would be playing."

speaker refel‘red»to he said,
