Grinnell-Drake Traditions. .

It is a common saying on the Grin-
nell campus that the Pioneer team
which meets Drake is never the same
team that plays in the previous games 1
of the season. Time and again thsi
dope bucket has been spilled in this
game. To Grinnell and Drake"
alike this same means more than an
ordinary football game. It is a real
ﬁght- and neither side attempts to
camouflage the fact that they would
rather win this game than beat all the
other teams on their schedule. It is
this game to which both schools point
during tho entire season and it is by
this game that a season is judged to
be a success or a failure.

Every night this week the team has
been working till after dark set—
ting thc most or the days of
Practice before the ﬁnal ex—
amination of tho season. The coaches
up the defense of the line against the
belief that the Pioneer forward wall
will do its share of the worll Sfltllra
day after the gruelling test which
they have been put through this
week. A new system of offense also
which involves a new variety of line
play is being periccted and bids fair
to Cause the Bulldog refeuse plenty of
trouble when they essay to stop it.

Doping is I‘ruﬂess.
