Marshal Ferdinand Foch, on instruc—

night was laying plans for the invas-

on which the former enemy country
has defaulted.

The rich Ruhr- valley, on the left
bank of the Rhine, is 'to be seized

notiﬁed the allies of their intention,,

Two plays, “The Birthday of the in-
tooth" by Stewart Walker, and "Tw
Slatterns and a King" by Edna St.
Vincent Millay were presented with
marked success by the College Dra—
uiatic Composition class in the Rec—
itation Hall auditorium, last evening.
The humorous and rather unique
cllal'hcter of the plays made them as
pccially enjoyable and allowed cp—
portuuity for interpretation on the
part of the casts, which in both plays
were chosen from the strident body.
Not only was the work or the two
casts beyond criticism but some of
the individual members displayed a
wealth of dramatic ability. In] the

of Fhi p Rinaldo iu the part of the

‘that LIntuitiohisni is more positive

Went on to show' its implication to
‘Gud. God is supposed to be a being
that we can feel and the communion
with the deity in many cases takes
the form of appeal for power. The

to a presentation of the writings of
a contemporary French philosopher,
who has given expression to the ideas
of lntuitionism. In attempting to con-
ceive of time as a dimension of space
