Pioneer Squad Into Form.

The 1922 campaign for Missouri Val-
ley conference honors was opened
Thursday night when the Pioneers in-
vaded the Kansas Aggie territory and
were detected by a 23—13 score. The
Grinneli aggregation put up a scrappy
game put in spite of a rally in the
second half they were unable to de-
feat the Aggies on their home floor.

Baker Stars
The close guarding oi hoth teams

'was the feature of the first half and
during this period the Aggies were
able to score only two ﬁeld goals,
while two free throws by Benz were
the only tallies registered by fhc Pio-
neer hasketeers. Baker and' Benz,
two former Council Bluffs stars, were’
the best performers for the Pioneer
oilence. The playing of Baker at the

lei-Ward position came as Somewhati

of a Surprise to those who have known
him only as a guard. However, his
feet of caging three ﬁeld goals would
seem to indicate that he is a forward
of merit in addition to being a very
efficient guard

Grinnell fell before the strong Kau—
sas University team when the latter

took the long end of a 33-15 scorcl‘

The Pioneers put up a game scrap

perienced K. u. squad. Once or twice
they threatened to rally but were
never able to head their opponents.
