‘Pr exy Gives Dope
011 College Life

iSays Individuality Is Necessary
for a Successful College.

"A college, like a man or .1 woman,
must have individualtty," said pres—
ldcnt llain in chapel Fridﬁy morn-
‘illg. The college is something more
than a mere ’group of classrooms and
faculty members. Each collcgc has
its o11u outstanding features. Perv
baps tbc most outstandrng features
‘of Griunetl are that she is the only
college in the country to have vol-
untary chapel and that the Students
are brought together in a uniﬁed
511 it which we call the Criuucll
,Sp111t and which is equalled in but
iicw schools.

"The purpose of our dormitories
and ouadranglcs is to rlcyolopc that
group spirit of fcllcwship and good
will. The purpose of the college is
‘to give the student the best that it
has to make him feel as much at
home as possible.” The dormitories
furnish a medium for doing this thing
and are .1 foundation for thc building
up of that spirit of democracy for
which Grihnell is famous. ,

“Right personality has never been
or ever will be developed under com-
pulsion,” stated the president. This.
however, does not mean that our coir
logo is run without any rulcs or reg—
ulations but it does mean that there
are opportunities bcrc which the Stua
dcnt may take 'advantagc of as time
Passes."

In conclusion president Main suid
“Education is one of the most 111-ea
clcus things that can be had. It Czlu-
‘not bc bought and it cannot be poulu
ed into the students mind by the
members of the faculty. The faculty
can only be thc students guide to
help them take advantage of
opportunities."

iMaterial for Both Line and Back-

Nulelius, who has h1d chalge of the

,Grinncll's new football boss. First

‘ﬁrst apepztrauce on the hold and re-
ccived a hearty welcome from the
veterans whom he helped to coach
last year.

The ﬁrst night of regular practise

Both coaches, when questioned,

reporter that he thought his fellow

coordination on the coaching staff,
an extremely important factor, is as-
sured from the ﬁrst and should go
far toward producing a winning Fion<

Thirty Men Out.

About thirty men have turned out
for thc ﬁrst official practise, a num-
her which the coaches hope to see
‘consillel'able enlarged in the course

On the Whole the candidates luok
like an unusually promising lot this
year. ‘This is especially true in the
line where almost the entire veteran

possible that several lcttcr men will
