It’s a curious oonrmentary on the
present generation that while the
speaker at the "Fathers and sons"
Banquet, \Vllichl was held in the Mens
Gymnasium last night, was voicing his
faith in the young men of today a
number of this same group staged H.
mock holdup and departed with the
remaining ice cream. Verlly, the- mo
vies are far reaching in their influ-
ence!

CHANGING TRADITIONS

A prominent Grinuell professor, in
speaking or the life here, recently
remarked that while “we speak of the
Grinnell traditions, these succalled
doctrines change so frequently that it
is impossible to really know just What
is being considered.“ This comment
brings up it situation which is worthy
of consideration.

A tradition, literally

to generation. Such or

recipients of such information.

In this sense, crime“ has few tro-
ditions, but those which we do have
should be maintained and strengthen-
ed. There should be a distinct line
drawn between the temporary and the
permanent codes and each new class
should be carcfully drilled with regard
to the latter. There are a number or
these, such as the general reccptlop;

caused me to order the s. is B. that I
might better follow the school's ath-
letic progress Today I happened to

notice in one of your recent issues the‘

article signed "For a Grlhnell With
Ideals," and I am writing to pay “is
hute to Gl'illllell‘s facllltletlle faculty
of today as well as that of six years
agoeand possibly to Grinnell ideals,
which shc has in great abundance.
First let me say that the article in
question did not write on the subject
of Grinnell Ideals, as the signature
would indicate, but on‘ two vastly dire
ferent topics having only a microsco-
pic relationship wlth ideals. 0nd.
Grinncll as a Liberal Arts College, is
rather a question of policy, the other,
Tile Faculty and Its Activities, is rath-
er a question or personnel. His dis—
cu, ion has to do with the Ideal Grin
hell, not the Gl'innell Ideal. He has
deﬁnite opinions but quite inaccurate
knowledge. And he apparently ex

pests or Gl'illnell a degree of per~feo-;
tion that is possessed by no other crl- '
ucationnl institution on the face of_

the globe.

Your contributor describes the la.-
mous Gl'innell faculty thus; “A group
of discipline loving, machine-like ed-
ucators, who are deter-mined that if
they can develop a machine in which
every cog is an “A” student, the King-
dom of Heaven will be at hand.” How
my dear lrlend Ryan, and Peck, and
Main, rind Grinnaway, and st‘oops, and
Payne, and Nor) is and Huff, and Almy.
and Rusk, and Polling and sloitley—
and most of the old bunch who are
still on the' Jollillow they must have
smiled when they read that: Not a
smile of indifference but of aroused
pity that this student writer had no
greater conception of the word “coir
lege," no broader appreciation of its
opportunities.

What does this student desire in a
college faculty? A group ol football
coaches, v. ll. 0. A. secretaries,
dancing masters, and debating er
pol-ts who would pass out small mo
sols ol literal-y, scientific, and histor-
ical tbot stimulants as a side-line?
Does a college t tor its very yells
uahle on idc activ cs, or do the ace
tiritics exist tor the college? We
suppose this student would lliwc the

[acuity cut classes lol- the Eur-therence‘
for- l

of the esteemed Grlnncll Spir ,
getting that elimination oi the lass-
room and the “Luaehllmrllke” can
tor who rules it would automat ally
eliminate said Spirit and its force
ground, the college‘s outside acrlv
ties. A college e ' s for the sole
purpose of tedclllllg the world
serves to think, to think more quic
ly, more easily; more thoroly, in a
more orderly manner. Outside actil‘
ti , merely permit the practical ap-
plicatlon of that teaching, an applica—
tion that can be extremely important.
“A” work is desired only because it
assures more successful practical ap-
plication to the “outside activities" or
life.

The Grinnell faculty is for from
being pel-lect from any point ol view,
perhaps.
ing perfection seldom remain on a col-
lcgc faculty at $1500 to atom a year.
Some or them could not earn nearly
as much in the outside world at other
jobs; some or them could more thru
double their present incomes. But
certainly a great rnalority 01: the [ass
ulty members at Gl'innell make a sin-
ccl-c and valuable contribution to both
the Ideal Grinnell and the Grinncll
ideal. And the writer in question has
lnlsscd, so far, a. Eleni. opportu ' ’ by
tailing to possess the intimacies with
iaculty members which they so co -
dially invite. At college. as every-
where else in the wor-ld, you get out
of it only in proportion to what you
put in. Like Dos Passes in h army
service during the war, this studen s
contribution to his college is com-
paratively small.
