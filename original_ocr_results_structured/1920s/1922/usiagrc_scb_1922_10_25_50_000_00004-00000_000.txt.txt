ture of the college has been and is
each year.

"Right here 1 want to say that we
people or the college realize and ap-
preciate what your splendid ﬁnancial
and moral haciring has done for the
college from its founding seventy-
:nve years ago down to the present
“day It is not out or place 1 take it,
for me to express, here, our war-m
appreciation or this aid which you of
the town, have rendered to the college-
end while my subject is “The Value
of Our College to This Community
Measured in Terms or Dollars and
Cents" 1 want no one here to go away
with the idea that the college thinks
’thls is a one— -sided. arrangement.

"our interests and our problems
are mutual. Such occasions as this
:demonstrate this point "
