need for a. sympathetic attitude tuwrll‘d
the weaker races and the necessity ior
killing all traces of condescensicn.

His speech was a lervent plea to
tor-get race hetreds and to consider-
individuals; to have a uniiorin hatred
tor all evil traits; and an equal basis
for the judgment of all races. If this
is done. he prophesied, then may we

"Science and Ideals" was the subject
of the lecture delivered by Professor
H. w. Norris before the Fellowship
conteronce Wednesday mornlnng.
Ideals not only dominate human des—
tiny, ‘be said, but they must rest on a

roundation of knowledge obtained thru'

science, He pointed out that ideals
are subject to constant change as
man‘s knowledge changes and that
science, dealing with knowledge alone,
is the medium thrn which these
changes must come.

Protessor Norris made a signiﬁcant
mama: to those who liiwe been blam-
ing science for-adding to the horrors
oi wartare by the invention of such
things as submarines, high explosives,
mu poison gases. All these things
are inherently beneﬁcial and intended
for the use of man, he pointed out,
,, but man has taken them and perverted

- them from the uses ior which they
were intended, thereby.

adding to human suffering. Science
itself must he absolved irom all com-
plicity in world strife.

The truth about material things is
the goal of science. Nothing is too

ligation, or rather all things are sac-
red And are worthy or most careful

staole tor ideals but a roundation (or
them. Man's progress has always
been based on experience supplement-
ed and augumented by ideals. Science

to perfect his ideals. Science lays no
claim to immortality but the ideals
which are built on science are often
eternal though modiﬁed to comply
with new conditions created by in-
creased knowledge,

Phi. Gunuuvmy's Address

“The Man Problem" was the subject
of a most interacting lecture delivered
by Prof. J. w. Gannhway before the
delegates to the Fellowship Confer-
ence Thursday. In analyzing the
problem Prof. Gannaway declared that
Lllere were in reality two divisions to
the problem: the ﬁrst, oi the man in
the Church, and the second, of the man
outside the Church.

The man or today is not taking the
active part in the Church work, for one
reason because no is interested in his
clubs, lodges, sports and business, was
the thought of the speaker. At the
same time the Church cannot be ab-

solved from blame since it is ineliic-
ient in its business attairs. persish in
denominational aniagonisms, empha
sizes nnesssntials, and its members
rorget their Christianity in their daily
business.

Offering a constructive program to
meet the man problem and to arouse
the man to a more ncﬁvelpart in the
Church work, Prof. Gsnanway sug-
gested that the situation might be
remedied in several ways. The men
of the Church should ﬁrst be studied
by the Church workers. A survey at
the situation might be taken by a com-
mittee appointed by the next State
conierence. Lay leadership should
be emphasized and an open Forum
made the part of every church. "The
preaching of the gospel must be vital-
iacd. Mun wants a religion with a
kick in it" was the way in which the
speaker iorclbly put it.

In conclusion he stated that religion
and democracy are essentially the
same and whenever this point becomes
clear religion vrlll become pmtioal.
The need of the present day is for
an application or the Golden Rule and
if the ministers will preach this doc-
trlns without fear or flavor they can
will men. ,
“Religious Drhmlltizution‘

"The purpose of religious dramatiza—
tion is the presentation in action as
well as in words of the episodes of
the Scriptures and of the truth ex-
pressed in the Scriptures," stated proi.
w. H. Bridge in his lecture on "Scrip-
tural Dramatization" Thursday morn-
ing. He pointed out that such drama:
tiaations as “Overths Hill" present
certain truths that are brought out
in the Scriptures and thereiore de-
sewed to be classed under a religious
head. Emphasizing the power or dra-
matic appeal as the most powerful
method or inﬂuencing people, Profes-
sor Bridge went on to show the possi-
bilities oi the drama in Church work
and to distinguish between the cheap
and the religious types. Ea then
took up some or the problem of the
staging or scriptural pluya. giving
sources and bibliography or several
religious dram-s, illustrating stage ar.
rhngements and suggesting pructlcuble
methods to be employed in the train-
ing of the actors and the production
of the play. The thought that by the
medium of the religious dram the
characters or the Bible are made more
real to the actors as well as to the
audience wus also advanced by Pro-
iessor Bridge.

“Has the Chrlsﬁan‘church

continued.

Dl'. Patton then Went on to say that

way the contractors paid enormous
wages in order to make more them—
selves, and not because labor demand-
ed those wages.

"The great steel strike was not set-
tled—the causes still remain," declared
the speaker. Accordlng to the report
of the Interrchurch commission read
by Dr. Patton, “both issues and causes

American people." The strike will be
repeated: and justly. The causes of
the strike were that there was no Col-

better off than they were before the
Homestead strike; the exorbitant earn-
ings of the corporation, and the negli-

the strike was due to the size of the
corporation, the successful employ»
ment of strikerbreakers, and to bad
publicity."

From questionnaires filled out by
ministers in the strike area, it seemed
that they were in favor of the strike
but were “partly Indifferent, partly
