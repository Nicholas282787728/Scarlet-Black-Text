Bulldogs Will Meet Pioneers In
First Conﬂict of Season—
Euve Good Record.

DOPE POINTS T0 TIGHT
BATTLE IN ANNUAL DUEL
Comparative Scores Give Drake
Slight Edge In Second Home
Game in M. V.

Tonight in the men’s gym Drake and
Crinnell, rivals of old, will meet in‘
their hrst game of Lhe season. Owing
to the apparently equal strength oi the
teams and the excess oi enthusiasm
which always accompanies any Compe-
tition between the two schools it is ex-
pected that the game will prove to he

the premier thrill producer of the sear .

son on the local floor.

As far as dope on paper is con-
cerned Drake appears to have a slight
edge on the Pioneers ’Their record
to data includes wins over Oklahoma
and Ames, two games having been won
from the latter. But on the whole it
seems that Drake did its best work
during the iirst oi the season when
they completely swamped Oklahoma
and won ir-om Ames by a much larger
score in their ﬁrst game which was
played at Ames than they did in their
last game with the same team when
they barely gained the decision with
the game on their home iloor. They,
too, were forced to bow to the superior
strength of the Missouri Tigers when
the latter won from them at Des.
Moines by a score which nearly coin-
cides with the score which they ran
up against the Pioneers last Tuesday
night, The Tiger margin over the
Bull Dogs was 12 points while that
over the Pioneers was is points.
' Pioneers Improved .

it should be remembered, however,
that the Pioneer team which lost game
after game during the ﬁrst part of the
season is not the same team which
has recently won from Washington on
a foreign court, completely annihilat—
ed Cos, and showed itself to be a team
which could threaten even the charm-
pion Missourians. Beginning at the
ﬁrst of the season with a. new coach
and a new and complicated system to
master it was not surprising that they
showed up rather poorly at the onset
of the race for Valley honors, But
during the last two weeks, especially,
Coach Seunders‘ men have seemed to
take on 2. new life Which has made
their followers take on a more opti.
mistic attitude as they see the great
improvement and the dash of attack
which the team exhibits every day in
practice and in the few home games
which have ben played. The addition
of Smith at guard and Crltchett at for—
ward has proved a valuable asset to
the squad and one which should bode
well for the success of the Scarlet and
Black in the remaining games of the
season.

Payseur Drake Stir

Ted Puyseul' is the Drake star who
is expected to cause the Pioneers the
most trouble and it is expected that a
close watch will be kept on this cage
wizard who has an uncanny habit oi
being able to slip the sphere through
the mash from angles and distances
which seem almost impossible. Smith
of Nebraska had a similar record but
only made one lonely basket against
Capt, Macy in an netiro game. Knight
oi Missouri also was supposed to be
a dead shot and his best was two ﬁeld
goals against the Pioneers.

But when all is said it must be ad—
mitted that Drake-Grindell games of:
any sort have always had a disconcert-
ing habit of spilling dope to the four
winds. Usually their clashes are bat-
tles to the bitter end and there seems
no reason to believe that tonight's
game will be the exception to the rule.
The general opinion current on the
campus is that the Pioneers will win
but that the margin will be small, ﬁve
points being the most common guess
while ten points seems to be the out-
side limit \

It is expected that a capacity crowd
will attend the game. Plans are be-
ing made for organized cheering to in-
still die necessary pep into the Grin-
nelllans both on the court and on the
sidelines.

Girls Practice For
Inter-Class Series

The selection of the teams for the
girls' inter-class basketball series
will probably be completed today and
the ﬁrst game will be played next
Saturday afternoon. The seniors and
the freshmen have especially good
teams, and seem to be the strongest
contenders tor the championship sltho
practice indications are very uncer-
tain. The sophomores seem to rank
next with the juniors apparently last.
However, a dark horse or two may re
vive the situation and spill the dope.
interest in the series is becoming keen
and all the teams are practicing regu-
larly.

Quadites Affected ‘
By General Unrest
As Semester Opens

The wave of unrest has hit the
Quad full force. The rumble and
roar of it is heard up and down the
loggia; continually the scream of it
resounds even to third floor rooms!

The little truck is kept busy hauling
household belongings from cottage to
cottage and shrieking girls back agiln.
For everyone is movin ! The main
exodus is from the inllrmary, which
henceforth will be reserved for sick
Quadites rather than healthy ones:
girls who are leaving school and oth-
ers coming in the Second semester;
girls who tried of themselves as room-
mates and who are moving from their
once—coveted "singles;” girls who had
too many ﬁghts with s. uncegbeloved
roommate. We suspect that spring
weather has something to do with it
ﬂier who doesn't want to move, in
spring?

Eighth Annual Fellowship
Conference Closed Friday

 

The cighth annual Fellowship Con-
ference oi Congregational minister-s
which has been held in Grinnell thru—
out the weak, closed yesterday with
the sixth and dual address of Rev.
Carl s. Patton, Gates Memorial lec-
turer. ‘

Sixty-eight Congregational minis—
ters have been in attendance at the
conference which has been one of the
best ever held. The town attendance
at the meetings was excellent while
the student body turned out well for
the Gates Lectures which were held
in Herrick Chapel. There were also
many students at some oi the other
meetings, due to the varied and vital
program which was offered.

The Conference is an nnportant ido-
tol' in keeping the college in touch
with the ministers of the state and
the fact that many of the proiessors
were active in tho conierence or on
the program has had much to do with
stimulating the interests oi the stu-
dents here,

A number of special features were
incorporated in the program, among
them being the recital by the School
oi Music iaculty and a reception giv-
en ths visitors in the Quadrangle Wed-
nesday afternoon followed by a din—
ner there that evening. Outside of
college circles and the conference pro—
gram at the Chapel and in Alumni
Recitation Hall, the main event was
the Community Brothel-hood lunch-
Son at the Congregational church
Tuesday evening. Dr. Cornelious Piste
ton of Boston, Mas , was the speak—
er oi: the evening with the subject
"The New World, the Outlook for
Christinnlty."

Second “New World" Lecture .

In his second appearance before the
conference Wednesday morning Dr.
Patton ampliﬁed the ideas brought out
in his talk before Community Broth-
erhood Tuesday evening. Granting the
conditions in “The New World" as he
had touched upon them in his Tues—
day night address he discussed Amerc

ica's relationship to the great world
movement to advance the cause oi
Christ, He mentioned the interna-
tional Missionary Congress, an impor-
tant gathering held recently which
Dr, Patton declared had come near—
er to the heart oi the world’s diffi.
culty than the Washington conference
is doing, although not receiving any-
thing llke the publicity. It is a move<
ment to federate all the missionary
activities oi the world and the meet—
ing, which was participated in by
sixty—six delegates from dfteen na-
tious devoted itself to candid consid-
eration oi the great problems which
confront the missionaries oi the pres-
out day, such as the new nationalism.

As a result of this meeting Dr. Pat
ton said that he drew three major con—
clusions. The drst is that the work
oi extending Christianity has come into
a new status. It is now the largest
enterprise in all the world. The
missionary has become the real in—
tcmationallst and is creating the Con-
ditions without which peace is impos—
sible. His second conclusion was
that no matter how many nations you
may league in this world the great
burden must rest on England and the
United states and the third is that
with England staggering under the
burden of increased responsibilities
laid upon her by the war the United
States must bear thc brunt of the for—
ward movement at least during the
next decade. “God has put it up to
us." he said, "to head the regenera~
tion oi the New World."

in conclusion DrfPEtton laidEtFe‘ss
upon the unusual opportunities for
service which are placed before the
Congregational people of this country

Grinnell’s next Missouri Valley
game, following the scrap with Drake
here tonight, will be the third con-
ference game on the home ﬂoor when
the Pioneers meet the Nebraska Col-n-
huskers here Tuesday night, Febru—
ary 7.

While the Scarlet and Black stars
are mixing with the Bulldogs in hard
light for supremacy, Huskers will be
battling with the Ames Cyclones. Dope
on this game is not plentiful altho ii
is fairly sure that Nebraska will be
able to defeat the Iowa State men, An-
cording to present conierence ratings,
Nebraska stands ﬁfth in the percent-
age column while Amos is seventh. A

Win for the Cyclones Will tie them.

with Nebraska while a victory for the
later will shoot them up into fourth
place.

Nebraska heat the Pioneers in the
first game there and has won half of
her games. However, despite this
fact and the relative standings oi the
two teams in the Valley percentage
column, the locals are playing some of
the best basketball in the Valley and
a win over Drake will mean that the
Husktrs will have hard going if they
