Tim CYCLONE
A story appears in the Scarlet and

Black today relative to the tinancial‘

difficulties of the 1923 Cyclone man-
agcment. and this brings up a sub-
ject which has bothered junior annual
hoards for years. The Cyclone is an
ambitious book for the size of the
school and community in which it is
published. It is almost too ambition):

are to continue to reach the standard
set during the past two years, some
way must be found for increasing the
ﬁnancial revenue derived from the
publication at the hook.
