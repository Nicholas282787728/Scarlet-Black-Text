mester of this year (1921—22):

1. Eighteen absences incurred in

lies in the lust that attendance at‘

loss oi an hour's credit.

2. Authorized absences due to mem-

Grimlell Offensive Unable To Get

Defensive System-

MACY AND SMITH STAR
WITH SPECTACULAR wonx

Drake Springs Surprise In Change
Of Offensive Work — Large
Crowd In Attendance.

A bombshell Was dropped into the
Grinnell camp last Saturday night
when the Drake university rive won
from the Pioneers by a. score of 31
to 17. Aclose game was anticipated
but the darkest pessimistshad not sn-
ticipatcd that the margin would 'be
so great,

The Grinnell offensive which show—
ed so brilliantly against the Missouri
Tigers seemed to have lost all of the
speed and smoothness which charac-
tel’ized it in that game. Every attempt
or the Pioneers to get a rally under
way was promptly smothered by a de-
feuse which seemed to have been pian-
ued especially to combat the Grinnell
style of ollensive.

Wulhelrn Drake Star

The game was the roughest that has
been seen on the local ﬂoor this year,
Cspt. Smith and Devine both being
ejected lrom the game on personal'
fouls. Drake used a style of play
which was seemingly devoid or any
set system, their most common play
being a swilt dribble down the side-
line for a shot at the basket. Wilhelm
was the Drake ace at this style or
play, counting six held goals, most of
which were short shots made by a
test approach to the basket.

“Ty” Smith was 'the star fol: the
Pioneers by virtue or his spectacular
guarding in trying to stop the Drake
onslaught. Capt. Macy also played
a ﬁghting game at guard but the ef-
forts of both guards could not stop
the oflense of‘ the Bull Dogs. Benz
was hardly in condition to enter the
game but was kept in till the end be—
cause his services are'almost indis—
spcusible as the leader or the floor
Work. However in spite tor the fact
that he was obviously very weak, he
played a uervy some from whistle to
whistle. W'hitehill wasiniured dur~
ing the ﬁrst rew minutes of play and
Garner was put in for the remainder
or the game, counting two ﬁeld goals.
one of them a long shot from mid-ﬂoor
which drew a round of applause (tom
the onlookers. ,

The big surprise of the game was
the sacriﬁcing or Psyseur, Drake's
stal- polnt getter order that the
ball might be led'to Wilhelm. Pay-
seur was guarded so closely that he
did not succeed in gamerlng a single
ﬁeld goal but he registered seven
points out of as runny attempts by the
free throw method.

More than 1,200 persons crowded
the gymnasium—a record ior attend<
ance. The support which the team re—
ceived was or sterling quality through-
out the genie. Even when the Plan-
ears were hopelessly behind the
cheering never lacked in volume or
enthusiasm.
