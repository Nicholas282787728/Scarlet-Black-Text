Ted Gannaway, ’21, Writes About
His Work With Near East
Relief in Asia, Minor. i

An article or interest to Grinnell
students and alumni telling of some,
of the experiences to Ted Gannaway,
'21., who is doing deliei work in Asia
Minor, recently appeared in the Des
Moines Register, and we are reprints
ing it in lull. ~ .

Haw Howard T. Cami-away or Grin-
nell, 1a., trekked through the mom,
tain wilderness or Asia Minor, with

from Marash, a. Turkish nationalist
stronghold in Cilicia,'to Aleppo, is
told in a report from him at Near
East Relief headquarters here.

Notwithstanding sun sickness, short»
age of water, and constant menace or
mareuding Kurds, he delivered his
orphanage family to relief authorities
in Aleppo none of thern the Worse for
their 140 mile trip.

Young Gannaway, Who graduated at
Gl'innell college last year, put in
seven months work with the Near
East relief at the Turkish nationalist
town of Marash, when he received
orders to evacuate the orphans there
to the Beirut area. The step was part
to the’Eeirt area. The step was part
of at general Dolley of concertration
and economy. Gannaway writes:

"Just how I was to transport 229
children over the mountains, while
lacking motor cars and railroads,
was not mentioned in my orders.‘
None of the children could stride a}
horse, and many or them were too'
small to keep their seat on donkey—
back. So I had to create. I believe
i turned out something in the way of,
equipage which presented the mun—
iest sight since Noah and his outfit
marched into the ark. I got the Near
East Relief industrial department to
‘malte fifty or sixty good—sized boxesl
These I hitched in pairs across thel
backs ol ninety mules, and into these
panniers l loaded the children, two
to each ho Behind each mule. thus
loaded came a second animal, hearing
the food and bedding for the kid-
quartet, just ahead of him, all start-
ed this Near East Relief vesubuled
pullman, down_the mountain, while
the Americans waved me good luckI
from the personnel house windows."

No cooking was done throughout
the trip, the rations consisting of
bread, nuts and raisins. Camp would
be pitched by the side of the mount—
ain trail, each child sleeping rolled
up in blankets upon the ground. The
natural water supply was dangerous
ly short, and sometimes eight hours
,would be passed without a sign or
moisture along the route. Whenever
a watel'hole was ’tound, it was the sig-
nal for a halt, when 229 canteens.
made in Near East Relic: workshops
irom gasoline tins, would be filled.

“Fortunately," writes Gannaway, "1
had taken the precaution of arrang-
ing for a guard of Kemalist soldiers,
who accompanied us through to

Aleppo. The countryside, as it turn—
ed out, was swarming with Kurdish
chettehs. A chettah, or bandit, is us-
ually some young Kurd who gets
tired of sheep tending, and so steals a
gun and a. horse and joins up with
one of the local bands or merauders.
On our ﬁrst night out we encampcd
on the banks of the Ak Su, in com~
puny with a large donkey caravan.
Hardly had the latter left us, next
morning, when it Was set upon by
chettehs who killed ﬁve of the party
and led away the loaded animals to
their mountain stronghold. Two days
later we were stopped by ﬁve well»
known chettehs, but the sight or our
guard‘s rifles warned them off.
Meanwhile seven of our children were
down with sun sickness. We had no
medicines with us, and I was beginn-
ing to feel a bit nervous about their
safety when the Welcome sight or
Near East Relief motor trucks ap»
peared on the Aleppo road. These
had been sent out to meet us, and I
can tell you that i was grateful to
have the responsibility tor 229 young.
sters off my mind at last."

Gnnnaway says that, whereas the
prewar population of Marash consist»

led at an equal number or Moslems

and Christians, the latter are now re-
duced to one-quarter of the farmer
strength and consist mainly of wo-
men and children. Industries are
dead, and the town is filled with de-
stitute refugees who will most cer—
tainly perish if the Near East Relief
Withdraws its aid.

Young Gamaway is the son of Dr.
and Mrs. C. R. (runaway, who are all
so‘engaged in relief work in the near
east. He is the nephew of Professor J.
W. Gulmaway oi the department of
Political Science and graduated from
Grinnell with the classy of ’21,

STEINER ni T0 RESCUE

Miss Mary “meeluclx' librarian in the

following extract from the Library
Log which Will prove 0! interest to
many Gl‘innell friends.

A few evenings ago the librarian at

llaired young man in the reference

he was so overcome that he hid his
face in his handkerchief and shock
with subs.

After a. time the librarian could
bear- it no longer, but went up to him

trouble.

Is there anything we can do
(or you?" ‘ He was a lureig‘ner not
over here very long and his speech
was Very broken. The librarian
understood with much effort that be
was writing to his uncle in New York
and she assisted him by Putting on
the backs of two letters the return
address, in care of the librarian,
Glenville Branch.

He seemed immensely cheered.
Every day for a Week he came in to
inquire for his letter. Finally two of
them came—Special delivery, and an
hour later Maurice came in.
hugged the letters to his breast and
went or: in a far corner to read them.
In e few minutes he came hack
waving two ten dollar bills, his coun-
tenance aglow. “My uncle, he sent
me these, he Mr. Steiner," he said and
thrust into my hands it letter hear
ing the letterrhead “Edward A. Stein-
er, Grinnell College, Grinnell, Iowa.”
The uncle, the Well known author and
lecturer, Wrote to his troubled
nephew a most kindly and encourag-
ing letter. It seemed good indeed to
see so much joy on the countenance
of the youth who but a. few days pre-
vious had been so bowed down with
grief.
