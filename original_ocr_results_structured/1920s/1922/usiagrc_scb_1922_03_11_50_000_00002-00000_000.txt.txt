OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS.

The old .theory that “opportunity,
knocks hut once" is not altogether
true in a comimini -such as our own,,
even when considered in connection;
with an individual cvent such as 1de-l
hate, a student recital, or a play by
some amateur dramatists. Elli. every.
activity conducted by studcn‘ts ufi
Grinnell contributes something mnard
the lipshllildillg and the upholding ot
the rcpuuction ot the college. As
such, every enterprise is worthy or‘
the support oi the students and taciil-
ty oi the college and should not he
treated as the particular pet of a choa
sen few.

Each or those activities requires a.
great deal or time and care in prepar-
ation and nets very little, individually,
to the students who participate inl
them, Ii: is needless to call attention

to the beneﬁts that may be derived}

from attending such crcnts. We have
passed the kindergarten stage, sup—
posedly, and as such are quite cap-
ahle oi judging tor ourselves those
things which are most worth'while.
, Unqustionahly, however, each of these
does oiier certain deﬁnite things that‘
can he obtained in no other way and
failure to beneﬁt by them marks not
the knocking or opportunity but the
passing of opportunitic

Tonight, the recreational conuniitcc
oi the student Council is sponsoring‘
the ﬁrst attempt to provide separate
entertainment lor dancers and non—
dancers. This is a distinct advance
in the social life ol the college and-
is establishing a precedent that might
well be followed in tho iuture. Thcrc

tremendous success. Mr. Walkcr has
also put on several plays and pages
