He was disappointed. The eleven men of the Town Bond 3.: mod They
rounded their choichcs. In November, 1848, Town College, later Gllnnell
College, opened its doors in Davenport. The Christian idealism of the founders
was reflected in the laculty. It has been reproduced in every generation of
students. standards or genuine intellectual culture and dynamic Christian
character have been maintained to this day.
