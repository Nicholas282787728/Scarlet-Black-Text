takes the unit of an American glr,l
impersonal“); a Russian actress in
“F nonliglits, It Paramount Picture
which comes to the Strand theatre
ne\t Monday and Tuesday. Dainty
morning dresses, luxuriant gowns for
afternoon and evening, ﬁlmy negligeos
and dining. spDIL cllslumes constitute
her Wmdlolle in this splendid produc—
tion.

Miss Ferguson, who has been termed
the most beautifully dressed woman
CID the screen, Considers this one of
the most delightful roles of her ca-
reer. "The gowns have helped me in
my interpretation," Miss Ferguson
said, "just as theyhelperl Lizzie Par-
sons to lose her identity in Lisa Par-
siuova. My only regret is that the au—
diences will not have an opportunity
to sec the exquisite coloring oi the
gowns."

(IN 1774)

HAVE ever considered it as the indispensable

duty of every member of society to promote, as

for as in him lies, the prosperity of every indi—

vidual, but more especially of the community in
which he belongs."

Life insurance is inseparably bound up with the
prosperity of every ludivrdual family and community.
It is a secure and prosperous business and satisfactory
to the salesman in every way.

The John HANCOCK would like to interest a few
ambitious men wli iaduate this year to make JOHN
HANCOCK selling the life work.

Statistics on college graduates who have entered
life insurance place it a: the very top as a source of
income. Before making a decision as to your career
it would be well to make inquiries of the Agency
