Joe Rosenﬁeld Hzis Interesting
Experiences in Recent Euro»
perm Tour.

A two day trip to see the Passion
play. all t'ur thin. and an airpliuc
trip accross the English channel were
two or many interesting expo enccs
enjoyed by Joseph Roscuticld, .5,wllo
just returned from a three months
tour or Europe.

The report that it was costing
eight dollars alonc admission to the
lemon: Passion play or Oberammer-
gau seems to he fictitious, because
appr .imately $1.40 included cm»
(are from Munich to Ollcrllmmer-
gau and back, lodging ior lwoi nights,

‘iour meals and admission to the play.

Thi cost between 1300 and 1400

the acting or Anton Lang as Jesus
being especially Wondm‘iul. The

, only thing which detracted. according

to Rosenﬁeld, was the rough gutterdl
German, which of course was used
throughout. It seemed rather iucnnr
gruous that the apostles should he
talking this language, which the
average American does not consider
very apostolic.

The trip or slightly over three him-
dred miles irom Amsterdam to Lane
dou was made in just three hours, inr
eluded a brief stop at Rotterdam. The
plane aeocmodated six passengers very
comi'ortably in big easy chairs. An
interesting thing about the trip is
that the plane is only out or sight or
land for twelve minutes, and ii is
kept at an elevation great enough so
that the plane can glide to land one
way or the other in case the motor
rails.

The Rosenﬂelds were in italy at the
time or the railroad strike which was
accompanied by many sympathetic

Germany is over run with Ameri-
can tourists. It is by iar the cheap-
est place in Europe to visit with Hol—
land as the most expensive. Paris
which is supposed to he extravagcut‘
in its charges, is considerably cheap-

‘cr than New York.

There is much gambling in contin-

Mr. McEiwhron says that the Chi

that he would frequently ﬁnd some

they take their education much more

EXPECT 7,000 AT
WIS .THIS YEAR

University Looks for Large En-
rollment Next Week.

No one is estimating how many
students will gather in Madison next
week for the opening of the new year
of the University a: Wisconsin. The
best guess is pel‘hngs between 7,000
and 7,500. More than. 350 protessore
and about 050 instructors and assist.
ants are now assembling to teach
the army of students that Wisconsin
sends to her state university.

Althought no oficlal estimates or
the probable enrollment have been
announced, the number 01 inquiries
received by the registrar’s and dean's
oiiices during the summer indicate
that the total is likely to equal, if not
exceed, the fall enrollment last Septr
ember. The number of advanced
standing students transferred from
other institutions is likely to be larg-
er than before. The experience Of
tdrmer years would indicate that
present business conditions will in—
crease, rather than decrease, enroll—
ment in colleges and universities.

Last September a. total of 7,344
Students enrolled in the Wisconsin
state university, for the fall semester.
During the entire “year, including
both semesters rind summer session,
It total of 11,367 difllel'eut students en-
rolled in the un' sity, and 21,252
oihcl-s took correspondence courses
through the University extension
division.
