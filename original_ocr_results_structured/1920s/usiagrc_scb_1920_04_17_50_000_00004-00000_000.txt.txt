Minnesota Professor Speaks on
Monroe Doctrine.

Frofcssor'C. D, Allin, of the Poli—
tical Science Department, University
or Minnesota, lectured Thursday even.
ing on the subiect, "The rrcsent and
Future of the Monroe Doctrine." The
lecture was held in the auditorium of
Alumni Recitation Hall, before a.
large crowd of students and faculty
members.

Professor Allin sai . "There is a
common bciiel that we are a unit un-
to ourselves. This is not true for
our domestic and international issues
are inseparable, as shown by the tar-
iff and trust problems. The sitinc
thing is true of the Monroe Doctrine.
Our policy or nonrintervention [was

‘ovcrthrown when we entcrcd the war

and it seems destined that We contin—
“2 in peace for the Monroe Doctrine
has built up a notion strong both 9—
conomically and politically.

“There is no deﬁnition of the Man—
roe Doctrine that is clear and gener-
ally applicable. nowcver, there are
{our interpretations, n a m e l y ,
the nationalistic; the imperialistic;
the Pan-American; and‘the interna—
tional. Originally, the Monroe Doc—
'tril'le was primarily national, destined
to protect the United states and L3.—
tinrAmeriean states from the econoA
mic and political designs “of Europe.
Then our attitude changed—the United
states would not allow Latin-Ameri-
can states to bargain with European
powers in boundary disputes. Also,
the United states decided to permit
no territorial aggrandizement under
the disguise of boundary disputes un-
tilshc had judged the validity of such
claims. This led to an assumption or
s regency over the affairs of the La-
ti -Arnerlcan states and a nowerrul
voice in the control of economic poli-
ties there.

.“Pan-Amsi-icanism with regard to
the Monroe Doctrine was lhc out—
growth oi: Mr. Wilson’s policy or per—
mitting all of the South American
governments to aid in the settlement
or the Mexican situation and other si-
milar disputes. However, this Was
unsatisiactory. and we have ﬁnally
come to thc,iniernational attitude. The
Monroe‘Doctr—ihe has been made is
part of the peace treaty, at our insis—
tensc. Now, some are attempting to
rchue the treaty. We have one of two
alternatives: either to accept the
treaty and niche the Monroe Doctrine
international, or to reium the treaty
and isolate ourselves, assuming all the
complications that have arisen and
will continue to arise from such ac—
tion. This is the problem that we
must lace."
