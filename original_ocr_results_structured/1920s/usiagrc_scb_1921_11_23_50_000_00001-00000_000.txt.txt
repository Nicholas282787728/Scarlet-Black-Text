0n the eye of the annual battle with
Drake, the game toward which the
Pioneers nave pointed thrughout the
season, the famous Grinnell spirit is
asserting itself in a never to be for~
gotten manner The tcam has always
had a wonderful support in the cam»

,.,K.,,.. .. ... ..~.
bus but as the game with me“. am lelmc eilmg Gllnnell, or should be club to carry on a study of the rar growth of the whim um,

rival approaches, there has sprung
up 5}. bond llctu'ceen the team and the
students which seems to defy opposi
tion. As a result of this faith the Fio—
neers are going against Drake tomor-
row with a ﬁrm resolve not to dissa-
point thosa who have so much conﬁ—
dence in them.

_ Condition Good

The team is in the best condition it
has been this season and never before
has there been such enthusiasm ex-
hibited in practice as during the past
ten days, The varsity Staged their
last scrimmage Monday against the
strong prep team but the yearlings
seemed powerless to check their Spirit-
ed attach. Drake formations and pus.
ses, as used by the freshmen, were rc-
nentedly hrokenup. On the offensive
the backs seems to have forgotten how
to fumble and in spite of the cold
weather they handled the ball in ﬁne
style.

Last night the squad was put tllru
a long signal practice. This afternoon
the ﬁnal practice consisted of ﬁnal in-
structions before the game and a light
signal drill.

No Change in Lille

There will not in all probability be
any change in the line positions, Rich-
ards and Datesmen seem to be the log-
ieztl men for the and positions with
Miller and Janssen at the tackle posi-
tions. The guards will probably be
Nichols and Schmidt and at center
big way Norelius can be Counted on
to do his share of the work.

Bncllﬂcld Uncertain

There seems to he more uncelralnty
as to who will ﬁll’ the backﬁeld posir
tions. The indications at present are
that Garner will play quarter, Marie
ley fullback, and Fearing and Walters
the two halves. This combination
proved especially strong against Cor
bell and should form a well balanced
unit. Marklcy and Fearing are both
experienced varsity men while Wal-
ters and Garner have shown them‘
selves to De backﬁeld men of real more
it,

Toemorrow‘s game will be the last
in which Capt. Markley, Richards and
Miller will have an opportunity to
play on a Grinnell football team.
These men have played a top notch
game this year and it is expected that
they will put up it great ﬁght in this,
their farewell game for their alma
mater.
