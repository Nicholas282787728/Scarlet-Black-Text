in Pool Yesterday.

Art Cox led his senior

mores 23, the freshmen 22, and the
juniors 11. The present seniors

times. _
Carroll Dewey, backbone of Grin—
hell's varsity, was the outstanding
swimmer of the meet. Thomas was
largely responsible for the success of
the sophomores, while the diminu-

Races Slow

All the races were slow, but con-
sidering the fact that Grinnell‘s
tanksters have been practicing only
a short while, Coach Swehrengeu’s

er by a third of a length, none of the
races provided any thrills in the way
of competition. Alfred Conard up-
set the dope when he won the 200‘
yard breast stroke in a little dual

, race from Art de Persia who had
‘ been favored to take the event.

Four Has High
. Grade Average

Cottage Five Close Second
in Mid-Semester

Compilation.

Cottage Four ranked ﬁrst in the
average number of points made by
each girl in the cottage at mid—sem—
esters. with Cottage Five coming a
close second. The town upperclass
woman came third; Cottage Two,
fourth; Cottage Three. fifth; Central
and the town freshmen, sixth; and
Mears, seventh.

The ranking was made by averag—
ing the number- of grade points made
by the girls in each group, on the
basis of fifteen hours for each stu-
dent. With the new grade point sys-
tem of A counting for three points,
B for two, C for one, D as nothing,
and E subtracting one, the following
averages were made:

. Cottage IV .

. Cottage v

. Town Upperclass Women
. Cottage II

. Cottage III

. Central . ..
Town Freshmen Women 1.24
Mears 1.17
These figures show that the high
est percentage of 1.56 grade points
was about midway between a C and
a B, while the lowest of 1.17 grade
points was just barely above a 0.

Individual honors for grades went
to Rebecca Conard, who had an aver»
age of 1,43 grade points for each
hour of work. The outstanding stu—
dents in each one of the other groups
are:

Co-eds Become Real Life Savers After
Taking Swimming Course Given Here

Where is the man who would not
risk drowning to be rescued by a fair
college co-ed'.I

Many Grinnell college girls will be
qualified to patrol bathing beaches
next summer as a result of the
course in lifesaving now being given
by Miss Harriett Koglin, instructor
in swimming for girls,

Crinnell girls taking this course
are required to jump into the water
while fully clothed, disengage them-
selves from their clothes, and swim

a hundred yards.
swim a quarter of a mile,
good dive, and recover
eight feet under water. They are
taught the different carries, and
learn to break all kinds of holds and
to resuscitate drowning persons.
The primary purpose of the course,
however. is to teach the girls to save
themselves rather than to save other
people. No girls in the class can be
afraid of water. “If they have any
fear to begin with, they surely don‘t
when they are through,” said Miss

They also must

Conard Tells More
About Moss Growth

The common notion that a person
lost in the Woods can tell directions
by assuming that moss grows only
on the north side of trees is not
trustworthy, said Prof. Henry S.
Conard, head of the botany depart
ment of Grinnell college, in announc-
ing the results of two years of re
Search in the identiﬁcation of Ameri-
can mosses, with a view to relating
them ecologically to the larger ve-
getation and to other factors of en-
vironment.

“Masses,” said Dr. Cunard,
indicative of soil Conditions, if not
also of climatic conditions. it is
probable that We Will be able to dis-

"are

 

tinguish sour soils by the kinds of
mosses that grow on them. It is
quite certain that the climates of the
eastern parts of the United States
are clearly reflected in the number
and distribution of the mosses,”

This year the botany department
of Crinnell college has collected 1625
packets of mosses, with locality data.
These have come from Iowa, Minne-
sota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan,
Pennsylvania, New York, and Vere
mont. Fifteen varieties of mosses
have been found on the Grinnell
campus.

It seems that Bob Delong, not
satisfied with copying Harold Teeu's
haircuts last spring, is now startling
the campus with that famous comlc’s
method of draping his necktie.
