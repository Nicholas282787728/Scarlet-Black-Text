Thése imoderns demand Camels

MODERN smokers are the most
critical ever known, and Camel is
their favorite. Why? .

Camel is the one cigarette that
will stand up all day and as far
into the night as you care to go.

Modem, experienced smokers
know that they can smoke one
or a million Camels with never a
tired taste or a cigaretty after-
taste. Present-day smokers

11. J.

REYNOLDS TOBACCO COMPANY,

demand goodness, and ﬁnd it in
Camels —- the choicest tobaccos
grown and matchless ‘blending.
That is why Camel is favorite in
the modern world.

If you want the choice of the
hardest-to-please smokers of all
time, if you yearn for the mel-
lowest mildness that ever came

from a cigarette——
"Have rt Camel!”
