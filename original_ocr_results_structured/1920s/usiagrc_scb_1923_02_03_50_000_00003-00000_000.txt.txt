PENIS 'PAPIN'S

 

 

 

 

 

AMUEL PEPYS says in
his diary that Charles II,
for all his interest in the
Royal Society, laughed

"for spending their time only in
weighing of air and doing nothing
else since they sat.”

This helps to explain Why
Charles has come down to us as
(be “merry monarch."

The Royal Society was engaged

in important research. It was trys
ing to substitute facts for the
'mean‘ingless phrase “nature ab—
bors a vacuum," which had long
served to explain why water
rushes into a syringe—the com—
monest form of pumpv‘when the
piston is pulled out.

Denis Papin had as much to do
as anyone with these laughable
activities of the Royal Society.
Papin turned up in London one
day with a cylinder in which a
piston could slide. He boiled water
in the cylinder. The steam gener-

the ﬂame was removed, the Steam

Goneral

 

uproariously at‘lts members.

ated pusbcd the piston out. When‘

They Weighed Air—
mm’ Charles II Langhed

condensed. A vacuum was formed
and the weight of the outer air:
forced the unreslsting piston in;-

Out of these researches eventuu
ally came the steam engine:

London talked of [he scandalous
life that King Charles led, and paid
scant attention to such physicists
as Papin, whose work did so much
to change the whole character of
industry.

The study of air and air pumps
has been continued in spite of
Charles’s laughter. In the General
Electric Company’s Research
Laboratories, for instance, pumps‘
have been developed which will ex.
haust all but the last ten—billionth
of an atmosphere in a vessel.

This achievement marks the
beginning ofa new kind of chemis-
try—a chemistry that concerns
itself with the effect of forces on
matter in the absence of air, a
chemistry that has already en.
riched the world with invaluable
improvements in illumination, ra.
dio communication, and roentgen.
