Weimer Declares.

Arthur Weimer, representative of
Selcit college, spoke this morning in
chapel on the speaker's exchange pro—
gram which is being carried out
among colleges in the middle-West.
He gave a general resumes of the
activities, curriculum, and govern-
ment at his alma. mater.

{He compared Grinnell and Beloit tirst
as to curriculum. “The curriculum
emphasizes arts and sciences just as
Grlunell," said Welmer. “Beloit, how—
ever. doesn't have a large music
school. The courses are non-techni—
cal. Journalism courses were disconr
tinucd because they were considered
too technical. It is possible to pre~

pare for. high school teaching.

“Belcit has many activities

frats is keen. Deloit tries to have
athletics ior all."

In speaking of other activities,
Weimer mentioned drzlnatics which
system is similar to that at Grinnell.
the publications, a newspaper and an
annual, and forensics, The latter is
quite popular, and Beloit has taken
several championships and rated high
in speaking Contests.

Beloit differs from Grinnell in the
matter of student government. “The
men live in fraternities which are in-
dependent and self governing. The
women have sororitiss but do not live
in sorority houses. Their government
is directed somswhat by the dean.

"The directing of the student body
as a whole is in the hands of the stu-
dents. A General Bonrd, consisting of
the oiricers of the student body and
several other school leaders. consid—
crs rulings to be submitted to the
general Vote. A student council acts
as an intermediary body between the
students and the administration on all
cases where there is any disagree-
ment between the two.“

Mr. Weimer presented a general
but interesting plcture or Beloit in
his chapel talk. He was the third
speaker on the special program select—
ed by the students and givsn in
Chapel this Week.

Mr. Wclmcr is being entertained
during his stay in Grinnell by the
Forensic society. He will meet tar

For Drake Relays

Successful Indoor Season Should
Uncover Many cinder Soars.

Des Moines, 13,. April 9#(Special
to the SCARLET AND BLACK) .—l’_V-
cellent performances by the college
and university athletes of the middle
west in the indoor meet: this Season
point to a great campaign on track
and field in the big outdoor meets,
the first at which will he the Drake
relays here April 26 and 27,

A year ago this middle Western secs
tion of the United States experienced
a genuine scarcity or truly great
track men. as was evidenced by the
{act that the Big Ten conference pro-
vided only four at the members of
Uncle Sam's Olympic team. Addition—
al evidence was seen in the fact that
only one individual contributed a res
cord breaking performance in the
Drake relays of 1928. That individual
was White, the star shot putter of
the Kansas Teachers of Pittsburg.

From advance notice served by the
stars of many schools, things will be
ditlerent this spring. Already the best
pole vault record ever made by im
athlete of this territory has been bet-
tered; the best sprint records have
been equalled time and again: the
average or the mlddlc distance run-
ncrs will be better and the crop or
stars much more plentiful: the long
distance men are expected to outdo
the best efforts at 1928; the hurdlers
will equal if not surpass the pcrlorm.
ances of the best timber toppers who
stirred up to 1923.

The relay teams will be up to past
high standards in every way. Only
the jumpers and Weight men have not
been thoroughly tested mind there are
enough or the stars of 1928 on hand
again to assure capable performances
in these events.

tord College met a team of Gi-lnncll
women in the Quadrangle drawing
room last Monday evening in a non—
decision debate on the question, no.
solved: That full time employment
or married women in gainful occu»
nations outside the home should be
discontinued. A similar debate was
held in Rockford that evening.

.Tline Lildy opened the affirmative
side of the question supported by this
Rocklord womenl-lelcurWhitchill, '29,
opened the negative argument for
ci-inncll with to brief historical re.
view of the situation pointing out that
adjustments should be made rather
than ontircly‘ excluding marl-led wom-
cn from work outside the home. ‘

Louise Killtzel and Maxine mm-
berg, the other members of the Rock»
ford team, spoke in that order. Mar-
lsz. and Florence
Stonks, '23, who spoke in the second
and third places on the Grinnell team
pointed out the benefits of married
women hcing gainfully employed if
they so desired. Louise Killtzel made
the rebuttal for Rocklord ond Flor-
euce Steaks for Grinnell.

bate. A reception in honor ot the

Gloves, Bonnet, Lily, Leather
Medal To Be Given At Big Drag

 

Tile full list of prizes for the Brown
Derby Drlig has liunlly been annouu»
Cod and is truely stupendous and im-
pressive. The Brown Derby itself, a
Brown Eonnett for the woman, a pair
of green gloves, the lily of purity,
some purple stockings (opera length)
and a. red red rose make up the com-
plete list.

The Men’s prizes are the Derby
which is given for getting by biggest
on the least work and was awarded
last year to one Lorin Hill, well re<
memberell by all who were here last
year—very wcll remembersd. The
Sleep Gloves arc the emblems and
insignia of supreme sophistication
and were awarded last year to the
blushing and coy house chairman of
Building Five, Brewster Wobdliurn.
for his emulation of Earl Carroll's
bathtub party of New York fume.

' Brewster Gets Gloves

Brewster did Grinnoll proud except
that instead of the tub being filled
with wine it was only the chlorine
that they usually put in swimming
pools that made it taste that way. The

 

 

Lily of Purity is the super satire of
the your and was awarded last year
to Ralph Harris.

The women's prizes are lor the
same achievements as those of tho
men: The Brown Bonnet going to tile
women gotting by biggest with least
work, the' purple stockings are for
sophistication, while the red red rose,
being the passion flower anyway is
a fit emblem of purity.

Clirlstenscns to Play ‘

Tho giving out of the prizes is to
be the feature of the Brown Derby
Drag to be presented by the Signm
Delta Chi on May toul-th, Thu band
to play for the dnncc is Paul Chris-
tensen's twelve piece Brunswick re-
cording orchestra, Several entertain-
crs are included in the personal or

In closing allow us to announce
that nominations are now open ior
these six multifarious to say nothing
of being nefarious prizes. Let all
