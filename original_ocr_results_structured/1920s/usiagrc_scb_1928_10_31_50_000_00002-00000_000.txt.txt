lN'l‘lllililG ‘ VOTING

Regardless of how you die voting, the important
not is to know what you are voting for and wli,. We
are too prone to be guided by the statements oi others,
to accept our [tllnlly’s political party without question,
and to form and express an open opinion before we have
investigated the issues.

President Hopkins ol Dartmouth in his opening llLlr
drcs, oi the roll college lei-m declared the prevalence at
political small talli. “Tenlpcl'imleills,” he silid, “ icrsonal
habits, domestic relationships, r l ilnlecetlell , l'er
ligioiis Minimum and oven physical appearance are
disci ii [or houi usnail, ialscly and hip , cheaply,
unworthy or the limited intelligence at those pmllLlDdLr
ing in the discussion."

This is a severe condemnation at college students
but one i is certainly true in :t gloat degree, Fer-
lnips more than ever llcrm‘e prejudices and hates are ilgr
tiring iii a polili il campaign and the college students
presumably uniting the educated, Clenrcthllllilng class,
are int-ruins opinions based on these preindices. it is a
deplorable situation and we I'Cpcut again. regardless of
how you are votinn. linoit who: iuu are voting for and
