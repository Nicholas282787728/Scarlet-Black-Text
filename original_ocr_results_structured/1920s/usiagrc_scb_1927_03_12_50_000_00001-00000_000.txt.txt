“The,chief difference_between your
education and ours, that we begin
teaching foreign languages, mathe-
matics, and sciences at eleven years
of age, and ' you don't begin
teaching them until the child is about
fourteen," pointed out Dr, Helen
Wodehouse, English exchange profes-
sor at the University of ioiva, iri’llel'
talk on "English and American Edu-

cation" in A. R. H, auditorum Tllul'se‘

day evening at 8 o'clock.

Dr. Wodehouse opened her discus-
sion with a comparison of the lilSv
' torical backgi-oiinm of education in
England with than in America. “in
the sixteenth and seventeenth ccntur-
ies education was only for the wealth
people in England and was consider-
ed a luxury. During Cromwell's reign
there was some advancement, but his
England was not to remain and it
took England some time to recover
from the reign of Charles the Second.
Education was really started at the
end of the eighteenth century. How-
ever in America the New England col-
onies were‘ all begun with the idea
that all people must be educated, and
with the creed, ‘ it good education for
everyone and a better one when it

can be managed)
Sin-zit Written Exulllilmijolls

"In the seventeenth century Came
bridge and Oxford were brutal, crude,
and ignorant universities. At the end
at the eighteenth century and the be-
ginning of the nineteeth reform began
first at Oxford' A group of Oxford
professors introduced the system of
written examinations tor degrees. This
institution was greatly opposed, but
finally became effective and a special
mark of distinction was given to the
students doing work of high merit on
their papers, '

“The new religious movements
helped a great deal to further English
education, and soon alter the attempt
to improve the best education an ace
tempt was made to give education to
the poor. In the eighteenth century
charity schools were established.
Then the monotorial schools were es-
tablished, and in 1370 the government
gave grants for building schools.

“The school hoards also came into
existence about 1370. They were or—
ganizations of the government depart—
ment and formed a partnership be-
tween central and local control. 11‘
the board approved of the work which
the schools were doing it would give it
a 'grant of aid.’ However it was not,
until the last third of the nine-
teenth century that the schools for
the middle classes were investigated.
it was during this time that secondary
schools were established and the
Girl's Public Day School company
was organized.

, introduce Scholarship stem

“The work of the twentieth century
has been to join it all together; the
first step was the abolishment of the
government boards in 1902, whi n
gave the entire control to the cities
and counties. Also‘ the scholarship

system was introduced which enables v‘

the gifted child to get the best edu-
cation with little or no expense to
father. At the age of eleven years
children in the elementary schools are
given an examination and those chil-
dren who pass these examinations
best are given free places in the sec-
ondary schools. Of course, this syr—
tem does not take the place of the
American free public schools but it
is better than anything else that we
have ever had. In England there is
an overvlamling of the elementary
and secondary schools.

“While children are taught foreign
languages at an earlier age in Eng»
land they are not able to speak as
well as the American students, nor to

exp'l'ess their thoughts in such an orde.

The senior women's basketball team
Thursday afternoon defeated the
sophomore sextet by a score of 26715.
The fast"and cins tent playing of the
upper-class women gained them the
vietoiy over the erratic performance
Oi" thﬂil‘ opponents.
. The sophomores, who were unable
-to get started during the first half.
paid heavily for their wild passes and
their inability to hold the ball. The
senior team performed like clockwork
from the initial whistle, repeated
taking the ball down the court for a
series of field goals by Raw and Hui»
ris. The sophomores succeeded in
edging one basket and one free throw,
the half ending with a score of 1773
in favor of the seniors.
Silpllollloros Sniff Rally
The second half started snappily
and was featured by a spectacular
rally on the part of the sophomores.
Dart and hletcalf, sophomnl'e‘gunl‘ds,
came back to intercept long‘ senior
passes from center and succeeded in
giving their opponents a fight for 9w
ery shot. The sophomore centers
gave the'~ forwards ample support,
and Wilson, sophomore captain,
fought through close guarding for a
fast series of field goals. The seniors
added nine points during the second
half, making a final score of 26-] .
The uniforinily good playing of the
senior-team made it impossible to
single out individual stars. Accurate
passes by Hawley and Carlson are a
feature of the champions game, while
Raw and Harris possess an uneerius
eye for the basket. The work of
Scharnweber and McDowell was ese
pecinlly cficctive in keeping the
sophomores from running up their
side of the score. For the sophomoi s

the first of the game, warmed up to
a display of real basketball during We

getting the tipnff, while Stock played
a brilliant running game at center.

licager Crowd Greets Argument About
in Haugru Farm iteliet in
. ll. ii. Auditorium.

is

1 ring before an audience of eight
people, the iowa State Teachers col—
lege affirmative team composed of
Hugh Seabury, John Lotta, and Wayne
Truesdall clashed with theGrinnell
college team whose members were
Mack Swigcrt, Robert Burlingame,
and Don Reid in A. R. H. auditorium
last night on the hlcNary—Haugen
farm relief bill.

Seabury opened the discussion by
showing the serious problem existing
in agriculture today. He pointed out
that there were four thousand more
cases of bankruptcy in the period from
dull to 192i than the entire period
from 1910 to 1920. The fare
mer-s dollars are worth fifty cents on
the market today. acording to the af-
firmative. The cause of all the diffi-
culty was the surplus. Since that
problem needs solution, there are
three ways for a remedy. The ﬁrst,
decreasing acreage, and the second,
reduction of protective measures, are
obviously impracticable, The third.
which is the bloNary-Haugen bill, is
the only feasible plan.

Cites Steel Corporation

The affirmative went further when
Lotta pointed out that the fllchtry-
Haugcn bill would control the sur
plus, insure a system of orderly man
kcting, and maintain a sound ﬁnancial
basis. He cited the United states
Steel corporation, the California Rice
Growers’ association. and other indus—
tries as instances of orderly market
ing enterprises. Trnesdall insisted
that the bill would stabilize and not
raise the price of grain and pork.

in answer to the surplus argument
Swigert showed that there were LIB,»
000,000 acres of eiiltivamblc land in
the U, S. which could be used, and
they would be used if the margin were
raised. He also showed wherein in-
l'lfttlon of land values was a basic,
cause of the agricultural depl‘essiunl
and no means of coping with this was
found in this proposed solution. ‘

Burlingame very effectively showed
how the plan was unworkable. The
affirmative failed to meet him on the
issue of the success of the actual or-
gnnimtiou of the bill. Don Reid suc-
cessfully handled the refutation and
the summary of the two cases.

No Decision Given

A spirited rebuttal was the out
growth of a disagreement of the nega»
tive,stotement of the case. No for-
mal decision was given,

The Cedar Falls team was obviously
one which pointed for decisions. while
the Griunell team consistently ad—
liered to the English style of conver-
sational sp‘caking. ,

as chairman and led a lively open
forum after the formal debate.

Coaches Are Paid In
Relation to Faculty

ATHLETICS RECEIVE GREAT-
ER EMPHASIS AS WHOLE '
COLLEGE GROWS.

“it is true that coaches are paid.
lcs it Grinncll than in the other Mix»
sour-i Valley institutions," said Pfres~
iueut J, H. T. plain in ,a chapel ad—
dress Friday morning, which was i -
spircd by the recent editorial come
merit of the Scarlet and lilackonG '
ncll athletics "And,” continued the
president, “it is to our ever-lasting
credi We might, by hook or crook,
pay taboo or $6000 to a coach. But
by doing that we would be doing vio<
len'ce to our established principles."

The president's talk was intended
as a final pronouncement of Gl'innell's

"athletic creed, and in it he took par-

ticular pains to outline the policy
which Grinnell has followed and will
continue to follow in her inter-colleg-
iate relations.

He stressed the fact that this col—
lege does not regard its athletics as
a thing apart from the educational pro-
gram, but as an integral part of it,
with an important role to play in the
whole life of the college. The mem-
bers of the coaching staff must 064
cupy the same plane as other mem—
bers of the faculty. and they must
contribute in the same way to‘ the
ideals of the college. Tenure of
coaching service is not intended to be
short—lived at Grinnell, because men
are secured not primarily to win
fit into the
academic system,

"W'Llen the teaching staff goes on a
higher salary basis the athletic staff
will be there too,” Doctor Main prom—
ised, He also said that the movement
under way to increase the enrollment
of men at oriniiell should soon reduce
the numerical disparity between this
school and its associates in the ills-
souri Valley conference. -

The full text of Fl'eSident alsin's
speech follows:

“About a year ago a newspaper
writer worked his imagination over—
time and declared that our place in
the Valley confer-once was in danger.
There was not one iota of evidence
to justify that View. it was pure
’llulllL' it is true that there was a
time when our place might have been
called in question, because we were
maintaining a situation in conflict
with the conference rules. That is
the only question which has ever been
raised with regard to Grihnell. it was
up to us to make the necessary l'e-
adjustments, which are now a thing of
the past.

Larger student-holly Probable

"It is of course true that our stu»
dent body, limited as it is by selec—
tion, cannot compete in numbers with
institutions of a vastly different type,
but that is to our credit. Of course
we haven’t the great souads which
these other institutions have, from
which to draw reserves so that the
teams will always be 01 top quality.
But it is quite possiblc that facilities
will be provided in the nut distant
future for the enlargement of our stu-
dcut body. This togotlicr with paved
read, now under construction, will
ninterially change the (ii-lunch situa-
fioii with respect to atlendimoe.

“Meanwhile keep in mind that Gri'in- ~
iicll is shit: so far as the Missnurl Yal-
lc conference is concerned. Nothing
is likely to happen, nothing is going
to happen, unless we ourselves should
take the initiative. We aren't children
iii the dark. to be frightened by it bogy
map. Our standing in the conference,
in tho, strife, and in the world does not
depend on the going of one man, who.
ever he is, or the coming of another.

"It is stated that coaching is o.
Drecal'lous occupation, and that Coach<
es and athletic directors shouldh-eceive
high salaries because their tenure is
apt to be short—lived. Short-lived!
We are not seeking members of our
athletic staff on that basis. We zip.
