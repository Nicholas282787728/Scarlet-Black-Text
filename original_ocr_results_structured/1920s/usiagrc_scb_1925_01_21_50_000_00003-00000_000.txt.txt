This Week-

Sulllliiy Vespers
”The New Frontier" was the Sull-
ject chosen'by Glenn Clark. '05. for
his vesner talk last Sunday arternon.
Mr. mark is primarily a writer, whose
articles on prayer, which have hecn
appearing in the “Atlantic Monthly,"
‘ have attracted a great deal or attenr
tion. Therefore, it Wits with great
surprise oll’ the part of his audience
Sunday, that Mr, Clark was found to
be a .very agreeable speaker.

"A hall century ago," he said, "there
was a great American irontier. When
that frontier ceased to be a frontier,
men turned their energies . towards
world exploration. Expeditions Were
directed to the South Sea Islands and
to the north and south poles. Today.
these tields have been thoroughly ex-
hausted. Yet. there is a new fron-
l.ler,a lrcntier or the spirit."

Mr. Clark closed his speech With an

‘ allusion to the old days when on the
death of the ruler, the populace cried,
“Long live the King." “Our battle
cry today, he said, is, "Long live the
frontier!

Monthly

oue ot the most provocative chapel
talks of the school year was given last
Monday when Prof. (J. N. Smiley spoke
on the subject, “The Integrated‘the.”
His acknowledged purpose was not to
draw conclusions hot to piece a few
sayings and examples hetore his and:
lence

He lirst spoke or an old saying,
"What a lion eats turns to lion." Then
he took up the example or two ducks,
"The canvas—heck duck eats wild cel-
ery. The black duck would he just as
good as the canvas—hack duck if he
would only eat the confounded stuf ."
Mr. Smiley’s third illusratiun Wits that
of the queen bee. She comes from the
same Sort of eggs as the worker- hee,

. but in her infancy she is fed royal]
food.

The last example Professor Smiley
took up was that of an old dead tree
which stood out behind a. group of dor-
mitury buildings. In time its black
branches had acquired a Varied assort-
ment of cast-off garments from the
students. This, he'said, was an enﬂmr
pie or what an integrated lite was not.
If the tree had been it healthy, living
plant, with slip in its veins and green
leaves adorning its branches, then, in
its beauty, it worrld have been a per-
fect example of an integratedJife.

Tuesday

Retel‘elld Challes Cal-mall talked on
the ahuse of power and the lllIs-dltECr
tioll oi one's talent. “Anyone not yll'cr
par-ed [or power is or danger," hil-

. Car-man said, “The things out of which
come .are in themselves dangerous.
There is much truth in the statement

, or the it or oi the cage'”

Mr. Car-man then tall: d or the darn
"el' oi toc niuclr speciall rtion aull
cited izlrarcls Dar-u r as an example ol
(1 man who dcpr- cd himscit or pruch
enjoyment hy caﬂy devotion to a par-1
ticulnr- held oi thought. He snirl‘
f‘llssociatron with like pes prevents
men from the lull realr on or lire.”

In his closing remarks Mr. t‘ni'mml
quoted the scriptures. "Seeds yo ﬁrst
the kingdom or God and ye shall have
all good things."

Wednesday

talk this morning on the‘ subject.

"Values." He opened his speech 113’
telling oi the' views hy George F. Bah-
hitt, the business man oi Sinclair
Lewis' popular novel, on the progress
of his country. Bahbit believed that
progress could neither lie denied or
questioned. for \vcl‘c'nt the (‘itit‘s Con-
stantly increasing their population,
and wasn't a. great deal faster and silt-
cl‘ than ever before?

Mr. Wood brought out the fact that
progress is not measured hy the num—
ber.o[ improvements, but rather the
use made of them; mat these mat‘crrnl
things are only 0. means to 0nd.
“True progress," he said. “is only pos
sible through these three things:
knowledge consideration, and lore
sight."

“Would it he too much hersny to
suggest that the essentials of IL 560d
college are not cummittee meetings,
pep meetings, social allairs nor lathe
letic teams? College students must
learn to look beneath the outer crust
oi life here and see the true hidden
values,
