COMPLIMENT TEE Y. M. c. A
The appointment of a committee‘ by the Y. M. c. A.
to investigate the' opening or the library on. Friday
night shows that this organization at least sees thc
value in such a more. Student opinion can do much

towaltl accomplishing this change, and the Y. M. C, A.
is to he complimented as the first campus organi ttion
to recognize the situation.

There does not seem to be ally Serious argument
against keeping it open. MISS Clark has long been ill
favor of it, and repeated requests to the trustees have
been lllillle for an increase in the library‘s appropria-
tion. But so far the trustees have not seen [it to
lllzilie it no ible.

hli. Clark told a SCARLET 5: BLACK reporter
that the librai_ Should have been open Friday nights
(“'(‘ll below the introduction oi Saturday classes. 'ow
CCI‘Lllllih when li‘ridt' is nothing hnl an ordinary
week night, with clil‘ses the next morning. the need
[or access to the library is much _ ‘eatm'. The SCAR-
LET & BLACK hopes the trustees can ar llge to
meet this new situation. A. M.

CHAPEL PUBLICITY

Publicity is a high art these (lays. Even the chapel
service has been having its share of the new religious
publicity methods popularized by Mrs, McPherson and
the Reverend Frank Norris. Kidnapping and murder
are singularly elfective means of filling churches, The
success of the torrent of wit and farcasnl loosed this
week tron] the chapel platform in an effort to fill the
chapel is doubtful. As long as a date, a, cigarette, or
a breakfast is more attractive than a chapel service
there will be empty seats.

Surely no one will suggest expelling all coeds
blessed with any natural charms as a means of filling
the chapel. To destroy all the cigarettes in Gr'nnell
would he ’quile some job, and hunger iS a prettyitleep
seated instinct, one often more pleasantly answered at
IO o'clock than at 7. Whether it's worth while were
i'ying about the ones who do not go to chapel is a
question really Worth some consideration. But if a
larger attendance is still desired, there remains but
one thing to {Io~l.nill(8 chapel more attractive. If the
faculty feels that to attract a larger attendance neces-
sitates a lowering of standards, then the present cam—
pa n should be dropped. If the two can go together,
then let's have the Change.

But whatever happens let‘s remember it takes two
to a. make a. speech. For just as surely as there are
not enough pipes in the chapel organ to express Mr.
Matlacli's feelings after a chapel talk, So there are not
enough diunbells in all the college gylunasiuii’ls in
Iowa to adequately represent the intelligence of Grin»
nell college students as it must appear to many a
chapel speaker. a. M.

Leading the field of twenty-live

entered in the run last year, and
\ to better weather conditions pre
sling, the mcet was run off in
better shape than the meeting or last
fall. Richardson won the race for
the second consecutive time, but it
is thought that his time in this
year's run was not as last as in
that at last year.

Richardson is ineligible for var-
sity competition this semester due to
scholastic diificnlties, but with these
erased at the end of the present
term, a great deal may be expected
of him in the spring meets.

had no competition on his journey

. ,At eleven o’clock on
November 11 men stood with bowed
heads and quieted hearts throughout
the world, While they remembered
the dead and gave honor to those
who had ionght in the Great War.
But in the Grinnell college li-
bral'y this was not so. The pressure
of studies and the apparent Shallow
ness of thought possessed by the
students allowed many of them to
violate this sacred tradition. The
tramping ol rcet on the stairs
drowned all remembrance oi the
tramping of the armies of 1518. The
opening or the various catalog boxes
shut out all thought of opening up
the pent-up emotions of a world that
had been waiting so long for peace.
The deep concern in the matters at
hand, such as study, conversation,
and chair moving. ete., effectually
prevented any reflection on the deep
concern felt by so many who re
memhered 1913.

Grinllell college students stand
among the finest and best of all
bodies both from a scholastic rind
athletic standpoint, but unless more
thought is given to the sacred inheri-
tance oi the past, the students or
this school will not be present when
recognition or "honor to whom iron-
or is due" is seen as a virtue among
men.

Chapel Services Discussed
By Fauully And Sludenls

is chapel attendaue
ell?" was the questlon d cussed in
chllesda .Tlulrsdzlyllndl lddr rrom
the oralhist's point or view. the , ml:
cpts' point or liew and that or the f c§

lllty, lw tour speakers.

The small chapel attendances have
caused much disci sion on the part at
taclllly and many witi . on the par.
of the student ho A decision
has made a week ago to get at th>
heart of the situation,

on Wednesday, H, \r. ilallaclr
chapel organist, spoke on the elfecls‘.
of some chapel services and talks oul
him. He raised the question of what
type of chapel scrvic would appeal‘
to the students.

Mr, Matlack concluded that a parade
to chapel would be as. ured if the en-
tertainment included: The Sei-cnadcrs,
the interpretative dancing class, the
Mississippi Six and Gilda Gray. This
would probably appeal to the‘
"Plastic Age” more than anything
else, was Mr. Matlrtclr-s inlerencc.

On Thursday. Loren Reid, and Rob-
ert Burlingume presented the laxness
in chapel attendance from the stud-
ents' view. Mr. Reid said that it was
the nature at the topics which made

Eurlingame's talk was devoted to
euloglzing the Grinnell football team
which he concluded was an outgrowth
of the Grinnell chapel. ,

The three days' discussion was cliev
maxed by Dr. Steiner, Friday. Dr.
Steiner said that it was not the app
of Gl'lnnell chapel to have jazz.
Grinnell is rich in tradition and her
voluntary chapel is one of her greatest
customs.

Dr. Steiner snolte from the view
point or a member of the rdcnlty. The
idea or speaking at chapel was treated
as a nightmare by him. After Miss
Eager had asked a faculty member to
speak at chapel, the week rollcwine
the invitation was one so 'cs or appar-
itions, occur-dine to Dr. Steiner.

The chapel services return to the
same routine next week and the rlllesr
tion ol chapel attendance is unsolved,
