PrOlc paper published

An article by C. Edwin Gilmour, professor of political
science at Grinnell College, is featured in the most recent
issue of the Indian Journal of Political Science.

The article, entitled “Social and Economic Inequality and
the American Political Process," is carried in the June
August, 1575, issue of the journal.

Dr, Gilmour, in the article, details and documents the
significant extent of social and economic inequality in the
United States today in spite of the civil rights revolution, the
war on poverty, extensive manpower and remedial education
programs, an alleged progressive tax system, and the eiiorts
of the black power and women’s liberation movements,

He then explores the role and responsibility or the
American political system in such inequalities, discussing
five models of the American political process that offer in-
sight into the harsh behavorial realities,

The Grinneil educator served as a Fulbright visiting
proiessor or American political institutions and processes at
the University oi Bombay from August, 1974, through May,

1975.

Bottle money needed

Charlie Duke, physics proiessor and ioreign student ad-
viser has issued a plea to the campus to return empty pop
bottles to the containers by the machines. Income from the
pop machines on campus provides supplementary aid for
room and board. books, etc. for. foreign students. Some of
these students could not remain here without this aid, Income
irom the pop machines has been decreasing during the last
several years due to increased costs and bottle deposits.
Duke said that income this year is dependent upon the return
of the empty bottles. Duke stated that that normally 300 ca ses
of bottles worth 3900 are lost per year.

Duke also stated that there have been problems with bottle
theft. Reports of both high school and college students tur-
ning bottles in to supermarkets {or deposit money have been
made.

change in policy by the Residence
Hall Improvement Committee
which allows only two B&G
workers to paint student rooms.
Under the old policy, which leit
students the option of painting
their rooms if they hadn't been
painted ior three years, only 17
rooms per year were being pain!
ted.

Now that it is being done for
them, 65 people so far have applied
for room painting. Over t
summer, 11 rooms in Clevelan
and a number in Main, Read,
Loose, Younkers, Dibble, Smith,
and Clarkiall together 104 ins
dividuals roomsiwere painted
Most oi the rooms that badl
needed painting were done during
the summer.

Dorm Painting has been held up
longer than desirable for a number
of reasons Crim explained
Primarily, until this week no
Residence Hall Improvement
Committee ior ’75176 existed, so

hails could not apply for painting.
Halls wanting to have their public
areas (Lounges, halls, etcrr
painted must make applicatio
with Sue Crim. She sets them
with me proper committee person
(North, South, or oiicampus), and
together the coordinator ant!-
committeeperson decide on cold"
and other improvements to 9'
made,

Another factor limiting the rate
of painting is the number of colors
available and the fact that each
individual room may be painted a
different colori This means that
BRIG must use brushes and rollers
instead or a spray gun, There are
167 colors from which students can
choose, all with at least 75 per cent
light reilectance (the on
limitation on color set by k
college), making color choice a
problem in itseli.

Social events planned

Quality, not quantity, seems to
be the objective of the Social
Coordinating Committee, this
year. Chief coordinator Brian
Mann plans to have a wide variety
of groups performing at Grinnell.
He feels that in the past “tastes
have been slighted" and hopes to
“bring in the best with the money
we have,”

The first Public Events
Presentation is the Manhattan
Project, an experimental theatre
group, They will present two shows
of Alice Wonderland on Sept. 26
and 27 at 8:00 pm. and one show oi
Samuel Beckett’s End Game on
Sept. 23 at 3:00 pm, An open
workshop will be held in Connection
with these Shows on Sept. 26 314300
p,m.

Other upcoming public events
are the Lheno Folk Opera of Tibet

from Rome. 1 Musici does not tour
every year, and when on tour only
selects 40 places at which to per

Concert chairmen Don Meltzer
and Carlson Smith, in cooperation
with Activities Counselor Georgia
Dentel, have arranged the iirst
major concert ior the year. Per
forming will be Bruce Springsteen
and The E Street Band,

The concert committee selects
groups in several ways. Student
opinion and suggestions are cone
sidered. The concert chairmen
themselves also come up with
ideas oi which groups to get. In
addition, Georgia Dentel receives
mail from many groups wanting to
play at Grinnell. From a list of
possibilities, the chairmen decide
which good groups they can get for
the least amount oi money,

The ”very mixed tastes" in films
have generally been satisfied

uce G lm ch

man. Such diverse films as “Duck
Soup” and “0 Lucky Man" havg,
been shown thus far this semester,
both having large audiences. Ina
cluded in upcoming iilms are:
“Tom Jones,” “Frankenstein,"
and a Marlon Brando film festival.
Green also plans to show some
ioreign and xrrated iilms.

In booking a film, Green mainly
employs student opinion. He ta_
to people at films and gets the
suggestions oi people who call him
to comment on previously shown
movies. However. he usually won't

The films are chosen from
catalogues put out by Warner
