It Is hard lol‘ me to Sit and reflect
about years past at Grinnell. when
what's more on my mind these
_ days is the year ahead away irom
the place. But maybe i can com-
bine thoughts or the two.

During high school, we iinished
our civics and American history
requirements as the iuror ovcr
viet Nam rose to a tever pitch and
then resulted in a negotiated peace
and the return of the POW‘S. We
were the Students of the 70's who
everyone said would be much
calmer than our predecessors of
the GU'S. for we had no war about
which to protest.

II was predicted that we would
be more worried about papers alld
tests and gradepoint averages that

pattern?

would getus into grad schools, And
lroln the stories I hear about ac-
tivities in the 60's, I think we have
been

Now. as we graduate. so the
pattern goes. we are supposed to be
concerned about jobs and law
schools and how much money we
will have saved lll 2i year Unlike
our predecessors. we are not
supposed to be concerned with
changing the things that we don't
like about the society iii which VtC
llVC.

But I don't think we all fit the
pattern, |\'tlt all at us are concerned
about jobs and law schools litany
at us don‘t know just what we want
to do or where \l e liilnt to go. While
the grads oi the 60's probably
worried more about whether they
would heallle to mold soclely to lil
their needs. I think we are more
concerned about how we are going
to fit into society. Many of us are
going through real soul and society
searching right now.

But I think when we find we don't
quite fit into societal norms. we
may be more willing to bend them
to lit our needs When our
predecessors wcrc not able to
make right what they saw as
wrong. they otten retreated. i hear
stories about loi‘mcl' ”activists"
tilling bureaucratic offices in D.C
i also hear about dropout come
munitires around the country.

Graduating
Seniors-

Celebrate At

 

predecessors of the 60’s and early
70‘s. they \V'IIl endure I hope that
what they say about us is only a

. surface analysis.

i suppose Grinnell should have
mode inc optimistic about the
possibility of our idcals surviving
llut. in many ways. it hasn't.

Tllat’ been I've seen how
iiorried so many oi us are about
gradepoint averages 1 see an
elitist attltudc among llSithC
holler that now that we have gone
through loul‘ years of Grillnell we
are “well" educated and better
able to deill \tith the \iol‘ld than
most

l see pettinoss and ill-tighting
here. among students and raculty
and administrators. I listen to
these people tell me that I'll be
much less idealistic in ten years
and much more “realistic." And in
the back 01' my mind. I think that I
don't wantto be realistic llkC them

I like tn think that lots of my
fellow students wrote to Fritz
Maytag stating their opinions as to
how Gi‘innell College should vote
on proxies contronting the com-
panies in which it has stuck. But I
know that very few did. And I
wonder if they will state their
opinions when they own their own
Stock.

Bull most of all. I wonder it my
own ldCalS will survive [wonder it
I \\ il] be able to put the things that l
have learned in class and out
during the past tow years to good
use.

Right now. anyway. l'm still an
idealist

Congratulations
to the Seniors.
We'll see the rest

of you next fall!
