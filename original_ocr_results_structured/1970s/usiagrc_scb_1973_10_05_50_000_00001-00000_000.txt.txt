Grinnell Police reportthat two col-
lege women were accosted on the
campus late Friday and early Sat-
urday in separate incidents.

Police say a woman student called
at 11:30 p.m. Friday to report that
a man had made indecent comments
to her near Eighth Avenue and Park
Street.

The girl, whose name was not re-
leased, told police that the man left
on foot aiter she rejected his ad-
vances and "continued walking.”

police received a similar report
at 12:22 am Saturday. again, the
girl was untouched, and the man left
on foot. lie was last seen walking
West on Eighth Avenue.

Both girls described the suspect
as being huskv. abouLS’Ql' tall
with short brown hair and long side
burns. They add that he was dressed
in a plaid jacket.

A member of the student security
patrol followed the suspect until he
left the campus, but madenoattempt
to detain him. Assistant Dean of
Student Affairs Bob Jacobs said the
action was “well in line” with the
duties oi the patrol. »

He added that physical Contact
with suspects is not part of the
patrol members’ job but that ‘in

such instances members attempt
to maintain surveillance oi the per

In this case, the person left the
campus before Police arrived. Pa»
trol logs describe the suspect as
“about 30 years of age, with a mus—
tache and wearing a black and white
plaid cola."

Authorities had made no arrests in
the case at presstime.

Police Chief Bill Peters advised
all women to stay in well lighted
areas and, ii at all possible, to stay
in groups,

“A man might take on one girl
alone, but he's not going to bother
a group,” he noted, “The more, the
merrier.”

Peters added that a girl should
never converse with a man who
accosts her She should refuse
any advances and "just keep walk-
lng."

If the accuster persists in his ad-
vances, she should try to walk or
run for the nearest group of people.
If necessary, she should scream
to attract the attention of passers-
by.

Peters stressed that a phone call
to his department is vital to cur-
tailing such incidents. Peters says
he has been able to ”eliminate"
perpetrators of similar incidents
in the past, but that his officers
must first have information.

OCR Handles Records

An incident involving the alleged
theit of $300 worth of records from
KDlC—FM has been mediated through
the Office oi Community nights,
with a $30.00 fine levied against an
unidentified student.

Assistant Dean of Student Affairs
Hob Jacobs said the finewas agreed
to by the student and the station’s
executive board to cover possible
damage to the 60 records and the
inconvenience to station announcers
caused by the temporary loss of
these records.

Some controversy had arisen over
the confiscation of the records by
a member of the station executive
board, who removed them from a
student room while the student was
out of town.

Jacobs said that a deiinite policy
is established which would prevent
any turther misunderstandings. If a
member of the 1(ch executive board
has evidence that a student has re

, cords belonging to the station in
his room, he will ioilow the pros
cedure outlined in the StudentHandr
book, which states:

in all cases involving suspected viola-
tion of residence hall or college regula.
tions, entry shall be permitted to any
person who secures written authorization
iron. at leist two members oi the north
or South Campus JudicialCnuncil,Tnese
members must be on the Judicial Counr
oil which has jurisdicalion on tnecampus
where the student room to be entered is
located. The authorized person must he'
incompinied by an officer of the hall or
by any member oi the residence hairs
staff, and these have no option but to
accompany Ihe authorized person.

Off-Campus
Jacobs said that students living off»
campus who are suspected ofparti»
cipatlng in record theits posea more
difficult problem, since the College
has no direct authority to enter ap-
artments.

Station officials have three op-
tions: working through the oiiice at
Community Rights to mediate the
return of the records; bringing for
mal charges throughthe All-Campus
Judicial Council; or obtaining
a search warrant through the city
police.

Jacobs noted that under Iowa law,
the'theft of more than $20.00 _, in
this case, four or more albums _,
is treated as a felony. He added
that nobody wants to work through
the city authorities because of the
detrimental effects it would have on
a student’s future career, but that
this is an option available in cer-
tain cases.

Moratorium

Station officials have announced
a moratorium on prosecuting stur
dents who have station records in
their possession.

Students with KDIC records in their
possession are urged to return them
between Monday and the following
Monday, October 15. Records may
be taken to the Student Affairs Offr
ice or sent to that office via Campus
mail,

Students are guaranteed complete
anonymity if they return the records
during the moratorium period. JaCr
obs suggests that such students may
use a third party to deliver the res
cords if they wish.

ocn Background
The Office at Community Rights
was established in January to “help
make sell-government a workable
reality on the Grinnell campus ”
Members of the office serve as
mediators between any groups or
individuals on the campus who are
in disagreement. They may also
serve as advocates for community
members bringing judicial council
action, orias defenders for persons
charged before a judicial council.

To date the office has handled,,

in addition to the KDlC record theft
case, several roommate disagrees
ments and one case involving failure
oi a student to pay another student
for merchandise.

In addition to Jacobs, other meme
hers of the office are resident ad-
visers Connie Vanderhyden and Sam
Withers and students Marvin Bare
nes, Randi Bowman, Phyllis Daw-
son, Gregg Golden, Judy Rlvlin and
Tom Thornnill,

Office hours for the OCR are 200
until 4:00 p.m. Monday through Fri»
day.

Office hours for the OCR are 2: 0
until 4:00 p.m. Monday through Fri-
day. The office is located in Forum
117, telephone 271.

erman adds that the College has far
cilities to deal with such problems

On weekends, the student security
patrol is in operation, Members ot
the patrol carry “beeper” paging
devices, and canbe reached instantly
through the Campus operator.

Any person who requires assis-
tance is asked to call the operator
immediately. Whenthesecuritypat—
rot is not in operation, there are
night watchmen from the Buildings
and Grounds staff on duty who can
deal with problems.

In addition, Tederman asks that
any girl approached by a molester
or potential molester call him, Bob
Jacobs, or Dianne Ruyﬂelaere at
home as soon as possible This will
allow several campus resources to
be brought into action

Molesters sometimes work from
automobiles, and this can provide
the key to their identification. Aut-
horities agree that an automobile
description and especially a car
license number provide almost fool-
proof leads to the suspect. Women
are urged to take special note of
this information if tlley are accosted.

Students Boycott Horn

by John Wylie and
Brent Schondelmeyer

Grinnell’s SGA voted overwhelm—
ingly Wednesday night to ”urge the
Campus community” to boycott the
Longhorn alter hearing a report
from the Concerned Black Students
(CBS) alleging racialdiscrimination
at the establishment

By a vote of 22-14, the Joint
Boards voted to urge a boycott that
will continue until CBS feels its
grievances have been satisfactor-
ily resolved.

Sybille Scott, an assistant Student
Coordinator and member of the CBS
executive body, presented the CBS
position to the assembled House
Presidents.

Her statement outlinedthree griev-
ances:

l) The practice at making black
customers (parents and stu-
dents) wait long periods of time
beiore being seated or served.

2) Service without a smile/unnec~
essary rudeness to black custo~
mers

3) Eviction of black Students with~
out justihcation.

CBS stated that they had been in
contact with Tom Parmley, owner
oi the Longhorn, but‘ had received
insufficient redress to their griev-
ances, and would as a collective
body boycott until such time as they
did. They specifically wished a

statement ‘oi apology from Parmiey
to the Black students and to an
individual black student evicted from
the Longhorn Scott stated that rac-
ial incidents had increased in fre-
quency and discrimination was
"more than covert, it had become
overt.”

Lenny Kurz, All-Campus EPC re-
qresentative, made a motionthatthe
Joint Board endorse the CBS state-
ment. In support of the motion John
Potts, SGA ViCeePresident stated,
“I think we should (support CBS in
the matter) because this ,shit just
can't go on.”

The motion was approved on a
voice vote with three members stats
ing verbal abstention. Kurz follow-
ed immediately with another motion
“that the Joint Boards put into...
effect a boycott for similar
reasons."

Kurz felt that theJointBoarddidn’t
need to wait for arbitration of the
matter with the Grinnell Human
Rights Commission and that a boy—
cott could encourage anysubsequent
arbitration to go a certain way,

Earlier, Potts had stated, "It has
become apparent to me that the
Longhorn has no great love for you.
except for what you spend, whether
you are Black or white.”

The tenor of the meeting rapidly
changed with the introduction of

the second motion encouraging a

members.

campus-wide boycott.

lndi iduals it:

who had previously supported wait— ‘

ing for the results of the arbitra-
tion encouraged this stronger ac—
tion immediately.

Joe Genereux, student co»ordina~
tor, tell that any such action should
await the results of arbitration.
Genereux wanted “a few events to
run their course, see what happ-
ens through them, and not simply,
rather arrogantiy, attack the Horn
at this point. I don't think it is
quite justified yet."

Concern was expressed about the
detrimental effects such an action
would have on town-college rela-
tions. iohn Hanson, president oi
Norris. felt that a boycott might
have the eitect oi improving col-
lege—town relations, “I don’t think
that the people in this town are the
sort of people that would really
want to support these kinds oidis-
criminatory practices."

Scott Weil, SGA President, stated
that he would personally vote against
a boycott at this time if he could
vote, He felt that it could pos-
sibly prejudice any iniormal arbi—
tration and that until all channels
had been exhausted a boycott should

/

not be considered as there were no '

means available to enforce it.
Emotions ran high amongthepartir
cipants Gordon Edelstein, Meats
President, stated. “I don’t give a
shit what the arbitration says. No
matter where they go, I am going
to boycott the Longhorn,”
Weil asked the house presidents
to take into consideration thosé'
people that they represented and
the campus community as a whole.
A roll call vote was requested
by Potts. Cowles cast the only dis»
senting vote while Smith, Langan,
and one Loose president abstained.
