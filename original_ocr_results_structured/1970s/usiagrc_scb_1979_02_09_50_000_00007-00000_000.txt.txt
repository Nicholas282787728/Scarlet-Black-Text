Women’s

by Paul Schwartz

The women's varsity sports
program at Grinnell has developed
into an outlet for women seeking
serious athletic competition since
ll was initiated in 1972

Tllere are currently nine teams
open only to women at Grinllell,
eight of which were established
prior to the 1975776 season. It Is
only in the past three years,
however, that the program has
approached maturity, tripling in
its level of participation and cons
currently demanding qualified,
committed performances from
both athletes and coaches.

A contributing factor to the
development of Intercollegiate
athletics on a varsity level for
women was, somewhat Ironically,
the destruction of the women’s
gym on south campus The
women’s department was sub
sequently merged with the men‘s
in the new rec in 1970, affording
Women equal facilities with the
men.

Two years later, as a result of
women voicing their desires to
take advantage of the PEC's
Olympic sized pool and their
demonstrating enough enthusiasm
to convmce the (acuity that their
program would work, a separate
varsity swim team was established
for women only,

This was the first recognizedi
program of its kind at Grlnnell and
was followed by the addition of
seven more sports for women
during the following two years.
Prior to this development, the only
opportunity for women to compete
against other schools was on
"play" days held at Grinnell. when
other schools would viSit the
campus with a group of women to
play field hockey, The loose atmos
phere of these events is reflected in
its title since the teams were
thrown together without any
training, and the emphasis was
centered more on providing a day
of enjoyment for the Women than
any type of serious athletic com-
petition

With the advent of Cindy Winkler
on the sports scene In 1975,
women‘s sports finally began to
Jell into a well»organized,
respected program. The first
professionally qualified person
hired by Grinnell with the specific
purpose of improving the women’s
sports program, Winkler was soon
bestowed with the title of Coor-
dinator of Women's Athletics,

During her tenure the number of
women participating in varsity
sports programs at GrinneII has
approached 2m, an accomplish-
nlent.i\'hich Winkler attributes to
the "more sophisticated level of
athlete" emerging from lower
level programs and continuing in
their athletic endeavors. A major
problem of the women's sports
program during its first three
years was that most programs for
women were then only being
established around the country, so
that the women who were his
terested in competing in athletics
usually had little, if any, ex
perience in competition and
training.

“Athletics as an extracurricular ,

outlet had always been for men,”
Winkler notes, “but now in-
stitutions must providc this type of
outlet for women in addition to
their primary concern of
education."

A comparison with the men's
sports program is almost
inevitable iihen examining the
program for women at any School,
expecially since Congress passed
legislation in 1972 calling on
schools to provide equal op-

proportion to the programs offered
for men.

This does not mean that financial
support of women’s programs
must be equal to that of the men's,
but rather that the quality per
capita supplied for women must be
comparable to that supplied [or
men, Being a school where
academia is stressed much more
than athletics, Grinnell does not
nced to concern itself with the
aspect of offering scholarships to
women since none are offered to
men

The school does provide rather
equal opportunities for the women
and men. though, with there being
only one more men’s sport
program than women’s program
and both sexes being allowed to
utilize the facilities of the PEG to
its fullest extent.

In this last respect, in fact,
Grinnell's women’s sports
program is ahead of most schools
of comparable size since it has the
recently built PEC at its disposal,
Many of the women’s programs
face a problem of lack of corn
petition in the surrounding area,
however, a oroblem which is non
existent in the men’s varsity sports
programs and reﬂects Grinnell's
advanced offerings in the way 01
women’s sports compared to
nearby schools.

In this respect, then, Grinnell's
women athletes are worthy of the
name of “Pioneers" Since the
programs which have developed
here are truly a result of their
recently expressed desires for it.
The program will continue to
advance solong as they continue to
demonstrate a willingness to
participate in athletics on a
competitive level.
