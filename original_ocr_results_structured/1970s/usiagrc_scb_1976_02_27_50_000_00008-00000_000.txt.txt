Big games

for Haigh,

Pioneers

by Tom Arenberg

The Grinnell varsity basketball
team takes on the Cornell Rams
here tonight in a game that affects
the Midwest Conference standings
and the NCAA Division III
playoffs.

The Rams (1074 in the league and
14-6 overall) need one more Win to
clinch second place in the con-
ference. They are also trying to
compile a good enough overall
record to earn an invitation to the
Division Ill playoffs.

The game is also important for
the Pioneers (are), who dropped
from sixth spot into seventh last
week after losing to Carleton, 74-72,
in Darby Gym, Grinnell is only
one-half game behind sixth-place
Beloit (6-9), which moved up after
recording two victories last
week.

The Pioneer-Ram affair will also
match up the league’s top two
scorers. Grinnell's John Haigh
took the lead from Cornell’s Barry
Hopkins last week by sinking 27
points in the loss to Carleton, The
senior forward, who lost the title
last year to a teammate by one
point, has scored ten more points
this season than the Cornellian.
The top honor is actually up for
grabs between [our players and the
winner will probably be decided on
the last day. Grinnell center Scott
Lewis holds the 19th slot.

After Cornell, the Pioneers
challenge undefeated Coe, which is
ranked number one in Division III.
The game is tomorrow night at 7 :30
in Darby Gym. In the two teams‘
previous meeting, Coe (now 14~D in
the conference and 20-0 overall)
handed Grinnell its worst loss of
the season, 96-51, at Coe.

Last week against Carleton, the
Pioneers seemed to have the game
won as they held a fourrpnint lead
with 3:42 remaining. They went
into a “four-corner offense,” which
Mitchell said “means you don‘t
take a Shot.” But instead of passing
the ball around for as long as
possible, Grinnell shot twice and
missed both times, Carleton
grabbed the rebounds and cons
verted to tie the game at 70 With
2:25 left. Mitchell was especially
upset by his team’s two attempted
shots because, as he said, “we had
just talked about it during a
timeout.”

Afteran exchange of baskets, the
Pioneers missed another shot and
Carleton had their chance.
Keeping possession for more than
a minute, the Carls wound the
clock down until they Worked the
ball inside for the game»winning

A last second Grinnell bid to tie
failed as Haigh was tied up and he
could not get a good shot away.

The Grinnell junior Varsity team
came out on the short end twice
last week and its record dropped to
3-6. Last Monday, the Pioneers lost
to Cornell, ill-68, and Central beat
them, 91-77, last Friday. Both Were
road games.

Central’s victory avenged a 105-

the season in Darby Gym. Pioneer

team was slow and sluggish. “It
was not one of our better games.”

Men wave in two more wins

by Dave Schechter

in swimming terms a taper
comes near the end of the season,
when the coach benevolently cuts
the workout distance in order to
rest his swimmers for the “big
meetl” With Midwest Conference
championships one week away,
Grinnell coach Ray Oberrniller’s
squad is well into their taper.
Ripon and Lawrence were victims
of the taper's beneficial effects last
week, losing to Grinnell by scores
of 67743 and 68735 respectively.

This afternoon the team is in Mt.
Vernon for the final dual meet of
the season against Cornell, At
stake in this meet. as it has been
for the last several years, is
possession of the miniature
Buddha that sits in Grinnell’s
trophy case. Since the Buddha
became the prize for this dual meet
Grinneli has yet to lose.

What the swimmers may
remember most about last
weekend’s meets will not be their
performances, but the 12 hour ride

home through this winter‘s worst
storm. Last Friday, John Cham»
bers led the way against Ripon by
setting a school record in the 500
yard freestyle with a time of 5:11.41.
0n the 400 yard medley relay
Bruce Jones’ 100 yard backstroke
leg was a new freshmen record, his
time being 59.1.

Jones, Frank Halley, Bert
Simpson, and Chris Corton com-
bined the next day against
Lawrence to set a new freshmen
record in the medley relay. Slmp
son and Chambers also set pool
records in winning the 500 and 1000
freestyle events, respectively.
Simpson and Halley received
praise from obermiller for their
performances in both of the meets,

As conference approaches,
Obermiller will put the finishing
touches on his lineup, hoping that
he has made the right com»
binations as Grinnell seeks to
unseat Knox as conference
champions March 5-6 in Appleton,

Grappler finale

by Bob Meyer

Coach Mo Hunt said that he was
a little disappointed with the
wrestling team’s performance
Tuesday as they lost to William
Penn by the score of 34-22. Both
teams were forced to forfeit two of
the ten weight classes. Tuesday
was Grinnell's last match before
the upcoming Midwest Conference
Meet at Cornell College.

The highlights of the Penn tussle
were centered around the per-
formallces of freshman Gordon
Stacey (134) and senior Dan Mushy
(177). Stacey overpowered his
opponent and pinned him with a
minute and thirty seconds left in
the second period. Mosby man-
handled his Penn opponent and
won easily with a superior
decision.

The Pioneers incurred some

injuries in the Penn meet. Captain
Hosea Engram (167), who had won
by forfeit, injured his ribs while
wrestling in an exhibition match,
Scott Beers (126) suffered a back
injury as well,

A couple of days ago there ids a
possibility that these and other
injuries would keep a few of the
grapplers out of the Confere ce
Meet. However, the matmer .re
all healed and will bring all the
regularstarters up to Mt. Vernon
today and tomorrow,

Coach Hunt feels that ‘8
Grinnell grapplers could finish in
the first division at me Conference
Meet with several Pioneers prime
Competitors for first place finishes.
This team undoubtedly is the best
group of wrestlers that Grinnell
has seen in the last eight years.

Runners rank third

a third place finish in the second
indoor meet of the season last

Friday. Central easily took first.

the 2 mile run with a time of

10:24.9.

Commitment 0r academics?

byDaveSchechter

Where athletics fit into the
academic structure of Grinnell
College was the subject of a heated
discussion between the women’s
swim team and athletic director
John Pfitsch. The Wednesday
afternoon meeting was called after
the team decided to forfeit this
weekend's meets due to academic
pressure, Ptitsch expressed
concern for the future integrity of
Grinnell athletics while the team
voiced the feeling that their
academic work should receive
priority.

The swimmers were scheduled
to face the University of Nebraska
today and compete in a triangular
meet at Kearny State College with
Kansas State tomorrow, On
Monday. after a team meeting
showed that much or the team
would be unable to make the one
mile trip, it was decided to forfeit
the meets. Nebraska was
agreeable but Kcarny State,
perhaps remembering their one
point win here at the ti raclc

, has thrcair to protest
‘ ’0 it i in,
“What i want for you to understand

. , . My position is that, as athletic
director of Gtinnell College, if
Grinnell College says that it will do
something, I’ll do everything I can
to see that we do it."

Mike Daley, coach of the
women’s team, countered, “Each
individual made a commitment to
themselves as students and as
athletes, They are students first,
and athletes second." Pfitsch
expressed the opinion that if one is
to be a “scholareathlete” that
academics may suffer to some
extent. He told thc swimmers. ”If
we’re going to have women:
athletics. . ,you can't be a normal
student. You might not have better
grades,”

This year's women's swim
schedule, arranged by Daley, gave
the team just three out of eleven
meets at home, Sophomore Becky
Chipman commented, “It's hard to
keep up, going away every
weekend," and Rt‘nce Reichart
added, “It is Just impossible to
take off another weekend,”

Because Grinnell had previously
scheduled Nebraska, Daley added
a meet with Kcarny State The

latter will now face Kansas State in
a dual meet since Grinnell has
forfeited. Despite there being no
“home and home" arrangement
with Keamy, Pfitsch Stated, “If
you makeacommitment, you must
follow through on it . . . It's no
different than any kind of con-
tract.”

As it stands, last weekend’s win
over Carleton (Mankato St. having
forfeited to Grinnell) was the
women's final meet of the year.
Pfitsch will write Kearny State,
explaining the reasons for the
forfeit.

Team members were also
angered over Pfitsch's statement
that the women’s Swim team “is
the closest thing that the college
has to a varsity women’s team."
“We work out as hard or harder
than many men’s teams. i couldn’t
believe that he said that,” com-
merited one swimmer after the
meeting,

The mectmg ended with Daley
stating, “it’s a very simple matter
of rities," and Pfitsch retor-
ting, “I don’t agrcc with it, but I
understand it,”

Norris A (5-5).

To start the week off, Loose
edged out Norris A in a 4443
overtime thriller behind 23 tallies
by Frank Orth, while Main-Mears
crushed Rawson 6549 as Pete St.
Thomas and Jon Chazen combined
for as points. Later, OffrCampus
destroyed Norris I 56731, as Dave
Schafer scored 25 big points, and
Clark out-hustled Rush ’ as
John Hicks-Hershey tossedin 20
points {or the winners,

In other games, the. rots
fastbreaked their way to sit-13
win over Langan, and Loose
cruised by DC 53-49 as Orth hit for
as points. Younkers roared by
Clark 56-37, while Joe Cline’s 22
points led rush over Norris A 5-33,
Mo Hunt garnered 20 points in the
Profs win over Norris I, and Maine
Mears beat Langan 55-49 despite
loser Roy Barnes’ 34 tallies.

In Cored action the week saw a
couple of close games as the
Hoopers eased past Smith at the
buzzer 38-36, and Haines outlasted
Clevelanerames 44-42. iii-ed
