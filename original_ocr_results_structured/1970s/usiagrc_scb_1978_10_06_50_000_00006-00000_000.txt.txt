native people Dustin Hoffman
stars in the role of the creased and
weathered Jack Crabb, the lone
survtvtir of Custer’s last stand
looking back in retrospect at the
last 121 years at his lite.

His allegiance is drawn
inexorably to the culture oi the

with great beauty and awesome
spiritual calm by Chief Dan
George. Dustin Hollman is
marvelous, alive at almost every
moment and generous to those who
play opposite him.
