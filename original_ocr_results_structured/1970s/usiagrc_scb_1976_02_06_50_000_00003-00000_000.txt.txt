by Rosa Michnya

Two Grinnell juniors, John
Rensenhouse and Nancy Schein-
ield, spent last semester at the
Eugene O‘Neill Memorial Center
in Waterford. Connecticut, pare
ticipating in the National Theatre
Institute program. with twenty-
Seven other students.

Each student received sixteen
credits for four courses—costume
design, set design, acting. and
directing. They were also required
to choose one elective from the
three offered. Both Rensenhouse
and Scheinfeld selected set design
over costume design and puppetry.
Their daily schedule was a
rigorous one, with classes or
workshops regularly hcld irom
9:00 to 12130, 2:00 to 6'00, and 7:30
to 10:30, a total of ten and a half
hours.

Rensenhouse said that the staff
was “most impressive,” notably
Fred Voepel and David Hayes.
Voepel is a costume and set
designer in New York, Hayes
designs sets for the Metropolitan
Opera House and directs the
National Theatre for the Deaf.

,Which, according to Rensenhouse,
is “one oi the most highly regarded
regional theatres doing classic
plays." Another distinguished
visitor was John Broome,
movement director for the Royal
Shakespeare Company in London.

When the Grinnell Community
Theatre began in 1971 it had two
aims: to provide Grinnell with a
liveetheatre group, and to improve
townrgown relations, Various
participants in the theatre have
expressed a wide range oi
opinions as to their success in the
latter. However, in producing two
plays a year. members oi the
community have combined in
different ways to provide the town
with an interesting, stimulating
theatre program.

The Theatre began when a group
of junior high school students,
under the direction of Anne
Betenheim, ’72, presented a play
they had studied in an English
class during the previous school
year. Jeanne Burkle and Dorothy
rinder obtained iunding ior the
play irom the Community Arts
Association.

Later that {all Ned Donahoe, a
iormer professor oi theatre,
directed a readers’ theatre per-
formance of his own work, “Kings,
Queens, and Pawns.” With the
success oi this production the
possibility of a permanent com-
munity theatre began to be
seriously considered. .

The first season, 1971-1972, was
primarily a result of Donahoe's
initiative, with the support oi
various members of the com»
munity. They demoted to ask the
clty for funding, managed through
‘,the Parks and Recreation

'Dapartmenti .Additionallyo the.

The program also involved at
tending a variety of plays in Boston
and surrounding New England
areas.

As a special practice project, the
students spent two weeks
rehearsing the iirst act oi a
musical production. A videotape
was made so that they could
evaluate their periormance.

Classes ended in mideNovemher
when students began two weeks of
rehearsal for “Zen Play," written
by Paul Reps and directed by
Michael Posnick.

On December 1, they took the
production on tour, periorming for
audiences at seven colleges and
two high schools in New England.
The play, Rensenhouse stated,
”consisted of Reps' interpretation
of twenty short Zen fables.” Before
each performance, the cast
engaged the audience in com-
munication and concentration
exercises along with a number oi
other standard theatre games.
schelnfeld observed that it was
difficult at times to “get inhibited
people |o open up.” However, she ,
and Rensellhouse agreed that the
experiment was a success, It gave
them a chance to communicate
what they know as actors, and
most audiences responded well.

The last week oi the program
was spent in New York City.
During this time, Scheinfeld and
Rensenllousc stayed at the home oi
Hayes, one of their instructors.
”Zen Play” was periormed two
nights at the Manhattan Theatre
Club. The production was well
received by audiences and critics
alike. While in New York, the
group took tours oi C.B,S, and the
Met, and saw a number of shows.

Rensenhouse felt that one of the
best aspects oi his experience
involved the company oi twenty-
nine people. “Working closely with
other periormers and sharing such
a tight environment enabled us to

iowa Arts Council agreed to match
the amount put up by the city of
Grinnell, and the resulting yearly
budget of approximately $2,200 has
remained iairly constant.

Rehearsals and performances
are held in the Friendship Hall in
the basment oi the Congregational
Church on Broad Street, rented for
a token fee, but the group has no
permanent site of its own.

This is the major problem
Confronting the theatre. Without a
location of their own the members
cannot centralize their activities or
their properties. Sets and props are
stored in many private homes.
Consequently, no one is sure oi the
complete inventory or its
whereabouts.

Considerations of location inn
clude the necessity of being close to
the center of town to enable older
people or vehicle-less individuals
to participate. Sites such as an old
barn near town and the junior high
auditorium have been considered.

As with all infant institutions,
iinances are a hindering iactor, At
present all proﬁts go back into the
sponsoring unit oi the Parks and
Recreation Department.

Mrs, Switzer, a irequent pars
ticipant in the Theatre, suggests
constructing at Butler building for
the present, to be used for storage
until finances allow an additions

The largest stumbling block in
the search for a permanent site
seems to be the clash of priorities
which divide the members. Some

he stated.

Both iound the program intense
and demanding. According to
Scheinfeld, the rigorous aspects
“iorce you to push yourseli (in
acting) as you wouldn't in an
academic environment." She
stressed that the experience was
”purely practical, not academic,”
and added that she found working
solely with professionals and other
aspiring actors highly satisiying.

Participants in the program
acquired a clear perspective on
What it means to be an actor. As
Scheinfeld put it, “We know what
we're getting into." Both she and

iirst attract a large and consistent
audience and then, on the basis of
that support, secure a building.
Others feel that if the group has
established home this will bring in
a regular audience.

The drawing of a sizable and
predictable audience is in turn
related to the selection of plays.
Opinions as to what a community
theatre should produce diverge
sharply. Mrs. Switzer ieels
”escape” is necessary. She said
the last production of “The Effect
of Gamma Rays on Man in the
Moon Marigolds" was “too close to
reality to be pleasant. and thus had
no audience appeal. But I loved
‘Marigolds' and would doit again.”
She asserts that, at this point of
development, the audience appeal
must be the first consideration,
more intricate productions coming
later when the audience is more
established, ”Most of us aren’t
Culturally equal to Mr. Donahoe.
and i mean that asa compliment to
him,” she said.

Mrs. Jo Sethney, President of
the Board oi Directors, and one oi
the two directors along with Mr.
Donahoe, agreed with Mrs.
Switzer‘s statement, “We need
more variety. The community
wants entertainment and light
comedyiNeil Simon stuff, But I
also see a need to educate the town
with more involved productions

Rensenhouse have decided to
pursue acting careers. Following
graduation, Rensenhouse wants to
enter a regional repertory comv
pany; Scheinfeld would like to do
the same atter professional school.

Sandy Mofiett, associate
professor of theatre, explained
that applicants for the program
are screened by the Theatre
Department, The National Theatre
institute accepts two per semester.
Todd London and Rima Miller are
this semester’s successiul ap-
plicants.

Moiiett stated that the program

is “hard and irightening, ior
students are “thrown into an in-
tense, tastrpaced, competitive
situation ” However, he is very
impressed with the enthusiasm
participants show upon their
return. They ”come back with
energy and a revitalized respect
for what they are doing." This
Spirit, Moffett said, has a positive
influence upon other students and
is “infused into campus produce
tions.”

John Resenhbuse and Nancy Scheinield practice with others who participated in the National Theatre In-
stitute Program last semester. The group rehearsed and performed "Zen Play." written by Michael Posnickl
The Institute was held at the Eugene O'Neill Memorial Center in Waterford. Connecticut,

theatre group has attempted to act
as a “stepping stone, like the
College Choir, for combining the
town and gown, some townspeople
think the college and high school
students are taking it over."

Mrs Sethney agreed, pointing to
the unwillingness oi community
members to participate, “We
almost have to pull teeth to get
people to try out," she said. She
attributes this largely to the stress
of iamilies, babysitters, and car
scheduling pressures. The
inevitable result is that few adults
are willing to devote six to eight
weeks to rehearsal, although she
maintained that there is “certainly
enough talent in the town.” This
nonrparticipation in turn results in
a loss oi sense at community, as
college students, who are
primarily not long-term members
oi the community, repeatedly are
cast.

Mrs. Switzer also said when the
same people are seen again and
again, other possible participants
become discouraged and give up
trying. Thus, in eiiect, the group
becomes a repertory company
instead of a community theatre.

Mrs. Sethney noted difficulty in
getting high school students to
participate, “There aren’t many
kids at the high school interested in
drama, so it hurts the drama
teacher there if all his people are
involved in the community theatre
.-and are unavailable for high school
productions."

eatre group struggles

relations in lightof this dominance
by the college participants? Mrs.
Sethney believed the relationship
between the two “very, very good,
even though there has been some
resentment by outsiders towards
the college." Similarly, calling it
“Very plus participation,” Mrs.
Switzer said that her involvement
in the Community theatre “made
me more aware of the college as a
part of the community. I saw a lot
of the college people outside of
rehearsals and after the show was
over.” Mrs. Finder, a past
member of the Board of Directors,
calls it “a pretty good mix, and a
good place ior people to come
together and work cooperatively
and creatively.”

Twila Thompson, a college
member of the Theatre, voiced a
sentiment that hei‘ involvement
was “very enjoyable and useful in
becoming better acquainted with
the community.”

Future plans include developing
new directors to work on more than
two productions a year as well as
reexamining the procedure oi play
selection. Some members voiced
the fear that without a new inﬂux
oi participants the future. oi the
community theatre is in doubt,
consequently a drive ior more
members irom all parts of the
community will be a primary ef~
fort.

The Community Theatre’s next
production April 8, 9, and 10 will be
Susan Slade’s “Ready 'When YDu
Are.C.B.',’ directedby Jo Sethnéy.
