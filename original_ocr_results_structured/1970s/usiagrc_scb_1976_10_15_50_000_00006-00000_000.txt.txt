singles and social contacts are
spread out over the campus.”

One disadvantage which was
discussed at length was the limited
choice of housing arrangements.
Although the drawing system was
generally lauded, it was felt that
the present choice of singles,
doubles, a few triples, and off-
campus housing is too confining,
Alternatives suggested were suites
for under ten people and more
space [or fewer people, i.e. two.
room singles, threeroom doubles,
and four-room triples. The general
consensus was that the dorms
should be changed to fit the
students, not vice versa. Junior
Jane Horwitt felt, “We ought to be
able to Work within the structure of
the dorm ” rather than being forced
oficampus for a more agreeable
living atmosphere.

Ullberg felt that the meeting was
successful and planned to follow up
on it by meeting with smaller
groups of students to discuss
renovation in more detail.
Although ullberg said that plans
are currently for “ . . major im-
provements, not just paint jobs,”
he warned that, “The chances are
that new construction will not be
done in the near future . What
will be done is renovation "

Consultant Alice Coggins, who
attended the Cowles meeting,
presented the question, “What
would be the ideal dorm
arrangement?" to the twenty
students (mostly Cowles
habitants) who attended the study
break. General problems con
cerning the whole campus and
specific issues applicable only to
individual dorms were discussed,
Factors considered by some to be
assets, others felt were
detrimental to residence hall
living.

Reserving many of the superior
rooms for freshmen is a practice
many students don’t like. Also the

 

students felt that the selection of
roommates for new students is
done too randomly and no effort is
made to match character. Students
said they are discouraged from
changing rooms when they are
unsatisfied because changing is
such a delayed process. Said one
student, “When a student requests
a change of housing, no immediate
attempt is made to find new
arrangements. He just waits
around hoping maybe something
will open up."

Televisions, refrigerators,
kitchenettes. and pianos are items
students thought should be stan-
dard equipment in every dorm, not
justitems unique in some halls and
void in others. Students shouldn’t
have to choose between halls
because of their equipmental
fringe benefits when deciding
Where to live.

More shelf space and builtrin
closets were commonly desired
components, necessary to achieve
the ideally furnished room.
Bathtubs, enclosed telephones,
sinksin individual roams, carpeted
halls, restored walls, and overhead
lights, conveniences now enjoyed
by a portion of the residents would,
if extended to all the halls, con-
tribute to the ideal arrangement.

problems unique to certain
dorms were discussed also. Cowles
residents are annoyed by the lack
of cold water in their hall (because
of the cafeteria they have hot and
but running water in their taps).
Living in Norris was compared to
living in a fishbowl because of thin
walls, too much glass, and minimal
floor space, Noise was said to be
the major element of life in
Norris.

Wednesday night's meetings in
Younkers and James. apparently
affected by the Skip Day ex.
Citement, featured a turnout of
three students each plus a couple of
RA’s at Younkers. Points brought
up were much the same as those
voiced in Tuesday night’s meetings

Loose coffee

house
a success

by Nancy Gould

Live entertainment, free cookies
and free cider was enough in
centive to bring an approximate
crowd of 250 to 30!) students to
loose Lounge last Friday night.
The event, “The Loose Hall Coffee
House,” was the first campus
activity of its kind in many years.

The Coffee House organizers
attempted to create a Greenwich
Village type of atmosphere, that is.
a quiet place to talk and listen to
music. The music of the evening
was performed almost exclusively
by the talent of Loose Hall, Peter
Young, Bob Aldrich, Tim Conner
(Read Hall), Jim Craft, with Colin
Sacks, Herman Farrer and Ron
McCullough adding to the evening
with a few numbers.

According to Herman Farrer,
one of loose Hall's coordinators,
the Coffee House was a big sues
cess. He said that the school's
Coordinating Committee discussed
the event and has decided to have a
similar Coffee House every one or
two months, if there is sufficient
interest. The future Coffee Houses
will take place in different halls
across the campus.

Much of the success of the event
was due to the low cost of
producing it. A total of $70.00 was
spent on the cider, cookies, coffee,
tea and the rental of the Pub’s
sound system. The money was
gi en to Loose Hall by the
In iative Fund, so that no. hall
funds had to be used. ' '

The non-alcoholic nature of the
event was enjoyed by some
students as an alternative to the
usual parties that take place on a
weekend.

The Coffee House showed that a
hall can indeed provide a good
evening’s entertainment using the
talent in a dorm, Not only was the
music provided by hall members,
but the planning of me evening and
the baking of cookies was also
done through hall cooperation.

Hopefully the Coordinationg
Committee will carry out its plans
for future Coffee Houses around
the campus. The fine turnout for
last week’s Coffee House showed
that there is student interest in a
relaxed evening of music.

Mezvinsky

(continued from page 1)

congressman have worked for
reform with some success. They
have tried to “open up the system”
and to shift power away from
committee chairmen and towards
the party caucus.

Mezvinsky said that, When
elected in 1972, he felt. that the
system could work with a Congress
of one party and a President of
another. However. since then, he
says he has shifted to the belief
that is is important to have the
Congress and the White House
controlled by the same party.
Otherwise, he said, it is difficult to
hold a party accountable for what
happens during a session.

Also, Mezvinsky said he was
“tougher than most on the issue of
party discipline." Congressmen
must vote on the basis of their
conscience and their constituency,
he said, but party caucuses must
be able to put into national
leadership positions people who
reflect their views

He said that the push for reform
had been aided by better-organized
public interest groups. Such
groups, he said, are refining their
methods of evaluating and dealing
with congressmen. On many
issues, he said, “The real gut Vote,
the real test. is on certain key
amendments."

Mezvinsky said he was in favor
of public financing of
Congressional races and that he
“would be open to” the idea of
giving more to the challenger than
to the incumbent to offset the ins
cumbent’s advantage. He admitted
to receiving funds from out-ofstate
based organizations, saying he was
proud to receive money from
groups such as the National
Education Association, which has
many lowa members.

l-le attacked his opponent Jim
Leach for receiving $15,000 from
the Republic National Campaign
Committee, which he Called the
“Republican National Laun-
dromat.” He criticized Leach’s
campaign tactics, calling them
“negative.” “Someone must have
advised him to be tough, but I think
it has backfired,” he said,

Mezvlnsky said he supports
funding public education one third

He expressed support (a -
decriminalization. but not
llegalization of marijuana.

He said he favored preventing oil
companies from expanding into
other forms of energy. But he said
he was unsure about the need to
force oil companies to divide
vertically, whereby different
companies would handle the
pumping, the refining, and the
distribution of oil production. He
said he strongly supported tax
reform. He feels Congress ought th‘
rearrange its committ’
structures, limit committee
chairmen and other leaders to two
terms in these posts, require a»

limit Congressmen to three terms,

He explained his two votes in
favor of a pay raise for Congress,
after pledging to vote against it, by
saying that it was tied to pay raises
for some members of the ad-
ministrative and judicial bran-
ches. He said that pay raises were
needed for those people and that he
gives back his resultant pay raise
to the government each month.

Giving back pay raises, pushing
for reform, and working hard have
helped make Ed Mezvinsky
popular and effective
congressman. If Leach does not
beat Mezvinsky in this election, it
is possible that the book tha

interest in running for governor of

Clark and John Culver. In his stop
at Grinnell, Mezvinsky probably

probably had most of them
already. But he did fire up a?

do to win. As he said, “If we get the
vote out we can win decisively.”
