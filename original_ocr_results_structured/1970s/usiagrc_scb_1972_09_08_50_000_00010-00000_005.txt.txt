Not all of the songs are so serious. Songv
writers and their listeners have lost heir
ther their sense of humor nor their con-
cern ior the iniustices which they per-
ceive within society. "Illegal Smile” is
a very quiet and very funny “message"
song which gently plays upon adults’ tear
oi marijuana; “Won't you please tell the
man/l didn’t kill anyone/No, l’m Just try
mg to have me some fun.” The younger
generation cannot help but laugh at the
image oi the guardian oi morals who warns
oi the dangers oi pot and then relaxes with
his martini firmly held in hand. This is
a protest song, oi course, but the song—
writer’s tongue is no doubt squarely in
his cheek.

While marijuana may he laughed at, here
cm is taken seriously, Afterallthese years,
the difference between the two is clear.
“Sam Stone” is a man returning from
Vietnam hooked to the needle‘ "But the
morphine eased (his) pain/ And the grass
grew ‘round his brain/ And gave him all
the coniidence he lacked/With a Purple
Heart and a monkey on his back.” Sam
Stone remains hooked and iinally dies,
leavmg his iamily penniless. This is a
protest song at a sort, concerning our
troops in Vietnam, but as the ‘60s became
the ”10’s, new problems arising lrom that
set of circumstances have become visible.

The only “issue” which is still cone
spicuously raised is ecology, and Prine
paints a bitter picture oi his old town
called “Paradise." He wishes to return
to his home town in the hills of West Vir-
ginia, but his iather tells him: “Well,
I’m sorry, my son, but you’re too late in
asking/Mr. Peabody's coal train has hauled
it away."

Rock music has come a long way, yet
there is no doubt that it still hasa message
and that it is an important medium of ex—
pression and communication. Today'ssongs
are generally quieter, which may be a re-
sult oi the personal quality or the music.

The message is not hard to discover:
Simply, through rock music, today’s youth
are saying, “Look at me, I'm important
too. I may know whatihelieve in, out l'm
not sure where I'm going." Today’s music
leaves plenty of room ior introspection;
each song can have different personal con-
notations for each listener.

Yet the scene moves on. Just as no one
can say what will happen to the youth oi
the ‘70’5, no one can say what Will happen
to their music. ‘
