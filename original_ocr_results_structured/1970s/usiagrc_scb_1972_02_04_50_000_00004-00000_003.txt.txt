GIVING TESTIMONY

That day was my beginning. _
Even the gulleys were swollen with rain,
Their rotten iloors seething with air.
Father took me out

For the ilrst time that year,

Slinging his net onto the boat

As he always did, singing.

Already the sun blistered down.

It was the sort of day

That was perfect {or fishing.
We talked of it all the Way.

I in my live years only wishing

l know that
words are not an answer

and yet they wriggle torth lrom me,
persistently,

like insatiable worms that seek the rain,
time and again,

and they squirm into the open

only to be squashed by leathered ieet,

or leit to dry up in the uproarions sunlight
that has chased away

To have one myseli, to reel it in alone. the rain,
Scale it trom the skin and carry it home.
Father was lucky not to have a daughter.

We sailed out into rougher water. _
I had an orange life saver on.

Father had none.

Still I was larger than a man

That day, learning into the boat

That day, leaning into the boat,
Wondering it the sun would go down
OI! the eastern island to the south.
Father bending into the wind took note.
Rougher waves opened like a mouth

It clouded over like a rain

We little understood, a storm

That kept coming and coming,

Breaking the water and wracking the boat, ilailing
The mad water with her arms.

rather turned his stern side

into the grain.

Then we were covered.

We kept bobbing in the water like shellsl

I remember seaweed stuck in my throat

And my orange coat

Twisted over my head like a crown,

My whole irame ringing like a bell.

when I climbed up on the boat, hall struck.

On the bottom turned (upside; I turned into my luck.
Then I saw father go down.

He was swallowed like a stone,

His hands sticking at their sides.

His arms tought hard at the water, his pride

Was in not drowning there, not going down

Again. Then a ton or water covered him in blue,
Swarming over his head. Only his son watched it.
Then he bobbed up snapping like a stick,

His long body cracking in two.

I held on like a rope

Balanced there and clutching,

My thin Shell locked

As a Irame to the boat.

For over a day I was knocked

About by wind, battered and sucked.

A cold moon came up grinning

And my thin blood quivered and rocked.

Sleeping, and day came up easy and right.
Sort, the sun was warm and sure, bright.
Calm blanketed me like a cover.

A huge snip came ambling over.

i stood up, screaming and hoping

They'd see the small wreck

I stood up, laughing and screaming,

Days go by

they are all roller coasters
they are all alligators

they wear black underwear.
Some days strangle me,
Come to think DI it.

plants that break my lite in two,
retracted in the morning dew,

by sun that shines but never blues,
the day that lights the splendid luse,

that winds across the painlul plains,
that travel, trackless, to my brain:

my eyes alight,
my nose on tire,
my mind‘s enclosed in chicken wire

in a process that is always due,
to plants that split my lite in two.

Albert Ascoli

Night music

echoes in the rectangular cavern
accompanied by light

that dimly glares and seems to breed
the sounds:

the rustle of a lost reirlgerator
from my past

and a lone typewriter,

an execathedra staccato

ih’at tries the resurrection

the semester is dead,

long live the semester.

records yurnble together

from baby ruck to hard ass

racked up, wrecked on rock

the noise grows and I rise

to eilect a ceasing of its swell,

its incongruity, its splinters

made blasphemous by the dingy walls;
my own dinginess seeks to

purity ltseli with annoyance

and fails drably

grudgingly, drudgingly I sit and I am playing
scrabble with my thoughts,

a hymn, at last, to the night music
and the all pervasive squeaklng

oi a single shoe.

Albert Ascoli

I stood up there on the bottom turned
Capsized, giving testimony to the sun,
Screaming ol my Iather’s drowning,

That 1 was there, burned

Alive, grinning and screaming, saved.

It was as it someone had shot me with a gun.
lt was as it someone told me l was living.

It was over and braved

I stood there screaming Ior my llIe,
Already once dead, now once reborn,
Having survived myseli as only the living could.
l stood screaming, my thin heart bleating in wood,
My thin voice edging lrom its stone
I Siood screaming for all thai was known.
I came into my liie,
I came into my own
