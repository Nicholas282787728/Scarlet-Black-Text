day evening at Grinnell House
Withl the Joint Board to dis-
cuss problems in dormitories
this year resulting from the

increased amount of drinking

on Campus.

Tederman in his introduc-
tory comments observed that
the “Dean's office is not down
on boozel" but that heis more
concerned about the "violent
behaviour afterwards."

Ryan Explains

Admissions policies and
plans were outlined for mem~
bers of the Joint Board in a
special meeting held in the
South Lounge on Wednesday
night.

During the two-hourmeetin ,
Admissions Director D. Nich-
olas Ryan discussed topics
ranging from financialaid pole
icies to black admissions to
the new plans of the College
Entrance Examination Board

' (CEEB).

Black admissions willbe sli‘
mulalcd by several new plans
this year. Maurice Hunt, the
new black admissions counr
selor, will concentratehis re-
cruiting efforts this year in
three major metropolitan ar-
eas - Washington,D.C.,Mem-
phis, Tennessee, and Gary,
Indiana. Ryan hopes to gain
a larger pool of black appli-
cants through suchrecruiting.

Ryan also discussed the fig—
ures on black enrollment for
this year. There were nine-
teen black freshmen at Grin‘
nell this year, the same num-
ber as in the two prevlous
years. However, Ryan sa'v
nothing strange in this; he
pointed out that fifty'Blacks
had been tendered offers of

’ admission. He also pointed
out that blacks-*twelve per
cent of the financial aid re-
cipientsﬁreceived $44,000
out of $201,000 or about twene
ty-two per cent of the mone-
tary aid offered.

Ryan noted that this year's
SAT tests will have a new
look-cone which makes our
admissions office “eXtremely
nervous”. The CEEB has
added a new section for the
student to fill out on the tests

to make accusations"--he ap-
pealed to the hall officers to
be on hand to assist the RA’s
in particularly tense situ-
ations.

A short discussion ensued on
the misuse of fire extinguish-
ers, during which not much
was settled except for the fact
that probably very few of the
fire extinguishers have much
fluid left in them.

Several hall presidents come
plained about the noise level
during hall parties, partlcur
larly the rousing celebrations
of Alpha’Sigma Sigma. Chuck
McGrath, President of Lan-
gan, countered with the opinion
that actually the new fraternity

which asks for information on
academics and a rough figure
on family income.

The CEEBisalsoaskingpar-
ticipating colleges to provide
information on how students
with certain scores have fared
in their college career. From
this necessarily limited infor-
mation, the Boardwill provide
each participant with: 1) Free
jected probabilities for attain-
ing an A, B, and C average at
the institutions named by the
participant and 2) Projected
probable financial aid.

Grinncll has refused to prO‘
vide the necessary informa‘
tion input to the College Board.

Ryan does not feel thatGrin-
nell's stand will hurt it in
recruiting students and may
help it. As for relations be
tween the College Board and
Grinneli, Ryan noted that col-
lege President Glenn Leggett
is also Vice Chairman of the
College Board.

Ryan stated that the Admis~
sions Committee, consisting
of both faculty and student
members, is now in the pro-
cess of deciding on new Ad-
missions criteria. The pre-
sent criteria are based on two
major minimum qualifica'
tions: SAT scores of 600 or
above and a class rank in the
top quarter. Admissions of
any candidate falling below
these qualifications must be
considered by the Admissions
Board,

The remainder ofthemeeting
was taken up with specific
questions concerningscholar-
ship requirements and regur
lations, job assignments, and
importance of recommenda-
tions to admissions.

wasn't really that loud. Noone
pressed the issue.

Although Tederman claimed
that the noise levels in the
halls were worse this year,
most of the hall presidents
seemed to feel that the situa-
tion was net serious.

Loren Hart began the longest
discussion of the session when
he raised the question ofwhe-
ther booze isnecessaryathall
parties in the first place.
"Are hall parties just a good
excuse to get free booze?"

Paul Braun, RA in Clark,
claimed that "if we don‘tpro~
vide booze parties .hen peo-
ple will just find other ways
to drink," but Phil Sasich
didn’t think that anything was
wrong with that: “there is
simply a growing sentiment
towards no booze at house
parties."

Hart suggested that the halls
find other mys to have the fun,
and Cowlcs President Chris
Johnson ObserVEd that hishall
has had several non-booze
flings so far "whichhave been
very popular."

Johnson suggesteda general
attempt to “move awayfrom
all-hall booze parties," and
Tederman closed discussion
with a warning that "you have
to approach it very carefully.
People may think you're try-
ing to legislate theirmorals."

Recommendations from the
Computer Facilities Come
mittee concerning the direc-
torship of the Computer Cen~
ter were the primary topics
of the Executive Council'sSe-
ptember 29th deliberations.

Three possibilities were set
before the Council by the Com~
miltee. In order of the Come
mittee's preference, theyare:
i) to hire a full time direc*
tor who would offer courses in
computer science for one third
of his time, 2) to hire a
professional computer sci~
entist who would devote two
thirds of his time to the Cen-
ter and related activities and
one third of his timetoteach-
ing in some department, and
3) continue as at presentwith
one of the regular fulletime
faculty members as acting
director for one half of his
time.

Dean Waldo Walker argued
that since either of the first
two alternatives would mean
an addition of one-half person
to the faculty, they should be
rejected on the grounds of
financial exigency. There was
no indication of further dis
cussion or ofa final decision
on the matter in the excerpt-
ed minutes released October
7.

Further details of Council
action which took place in
early and mid September he
came available at Monday's
faculty meeting. Dr. Andrew
Billingsly and Mr. Randall C.
Morgan, Sr. were officially
named as the two members of
the black community from out-
side the campus community
who will serve on the so-
called Search Committee
which is seeking new black
faculty members.

Leggett noted that he expeCts
the Council to complete itsac»
tion on department size and
distribution by early October,
and that there would probably
be five or sixadditions. There
would be other openings in the
faculty caused by resigna-
tions and cancelled contracts.
The President noted that the
College has the option of net
filling a position until it can
find either a black or a wo-
man to fill it.

Although Faculty size and
distribution have been main
features of Council meetings
for six weeks, there was no
mention of any further discus
sion in the September 29 minu-
tes. No further information
on the subject has been forth-
coming for thepasttwo weeks.

16 Black Students Visit Third Chicago Expo

Sixteen Black students and
Langan RA Will Wilson at—
tended the third annual Black

ago. The CBS-funded troupe
left last Friday to see excit-
ing and elaborate displays of
Black Art, Sculpture, Busi-
ness functions and many other
of the numerous things exhi-
biting the importance ofblacks
in mainstream America. Ev-
erything from Congress to
Playboy magazine was repre-

sented with its black consti-
tuency.

Included in the weeks activi-
ties were performances by the
best of black entertainers in-
cluding Aretha Franklin, Roi
berta Flack,TheTemptations,

Five and Isaac Hayes.

To Sponsor SItiII Exchange

In accordance with Grinnell’s
long standing tradition ofturne
ing out wel I-roundedindividu-
ale and our own all out effort
to demolish stereotypes, the
Womens' Movement at Grin-
nail is sponsoring an out o'
sight, groovy, FREE, (open to
everybody) Skill Exchange
Program! The program will
be run by students for stu-
dents which means that you
can decide what you want to
do with it. Hopefully we can
work out something that can
accommodate everyone.

With this goal in mind, a
schedule of organizational
meetings for several differ
ent areas of study will be dis-
tributed to all the students on
campus sometime next week.
if you are interested in a par‘
ticular skill, all youhavetodo
is go to one of the meetings
and work out a time and a
place to meet.

Main areas of interest sofar
seem to be in sewing, baking,
carpentry, and auto mechan-
ics, but the whole thing is
Freel which means we can
probably work out just about
anything we want.

At the moment we need tea»
chers, especially peoplequal—
ified and willing to teach care
pentry and auto mechanics.
The more people we get to
teach the less each one of
them will have to do and if
we get enough people no one
should have to teach more than
one or two sessions unless
they want to.

So...get it together and con-
tact Margie (phone 6- 5800) be
fore Monday if you're inter-
ested in teaching. (Think what
a great experience that’ll be,
Ma) Jump right out of the old
rutl Expand your mindl Sup-
port the Skill Exchange!

The Scarlet and Black

Accommodations were made
for the Grinnell students by
the families of the students
who reside in the Chicago—
Gary area.

A total of more than 750,000
people attended and it is
thought by many to be. the
single most important black
event each year.

This year’s theme was
“Harambee,” which in Swa-
hili means "We are coming
home together."

Proceeds from the Expo go
to Cberation Breadbasket
headed by Jesse Jackson.

Tickets Required
For Maior Concerts

Students attending the Ali
Akbar Khan concert tomorrow
might find themselves out of
luck if they did not pick up a
ticket at the Forum deskdurc
ing the week. Admission to the
concert will be by ticket only.

The Social Policies Com-
mittee formalized a decision
made last Spring to require
tickets for allmajor concerts.
The decision was reachedaf»
ter many students complained
about the overcrowded condi~
tions at the Youngbloods con—
cert last spring. Many out-
siders came to Darby one or
two hours early, and when
many Grinnell students drift-
ed into the gym several min-
utes before the concert was to
begin, they found the gym had
an overflow crowd.

After all interested students
have obtained their tickets,
remaining seats will still be
offered at no charge to any
other interested parties.
