PACE Steps Out

by Ellyn Tnscano

The Poweshiek Association for
Conservation and Ecology (PACE)
was organized in May 0(19’72 to
promote environmental awareness
and education and to work towards
improvement oi the environment. As
LEAP (Local Eiiluence Abatement
Procedures), iormerly a college
environmental group, is no longer
in existence, PACE urges Grinnell
student involvement.

in the past months, PACEhas wor-
ked towards implementing some oi
its objectives into countypragrams,
It is responsible (or organizing
a city-managed newspaper recycls
ing collection.

With the aim oi increasing aware,
ness of environmental problems,
PACE members compiled a teach,
ing aid ior Poweshiek county teas
chers. sponsored a two day studies
workshop in which Grinnell faculty
members and students were in-
strumental in helping tocreateasCs
holarship designed to annually semi
a local teacher to a Conservation ed»
ucational school,

PACE is presently concerned with
projects dealing primarily withland
use planning and county zoning. Sally
Moore, chairwoman of PACE, exs
pressed the view oi the group that
the time is ripe tor county zoning
and tor putting the county land to
its best use. Also of importance
is the acquisition oi land ior county
parks and the two mile‘extenslon oi
city zoning,

when asked how students could be-
come involved in PACE activities,
Moore responded with a number oi
areas in which student research and

time would be useful:

r setting up a local recycling
center modeled alter the Arm
es operation (taking bottles,
Cans, cardboard etc. as well
as newspaper)
substituting a less damaging
soitening technique ior the
City
expanding the city’s paper
collection to include Cardbo-
ard (marketing techniques,
now etc.) ,
developing better techniques
ior local groups to apply pr-
essure in solving environ.
mental problems
analyzing iuture impact oi
newly developed county lands
till iur suitable operating
regulations to minimize dans
ger
developing a local “Automos
bile Mine” [or future use as
a resource and present diss
posal ior old cars
improving public transportar
tion to and from Grinnell
setting up scenic and histor—
ical bicycle tours in Grinnell
and Poweshiek County and es-
tablishing permanent bikes
ways.

She iurther urged interested studs
ents to contact Ken Christiansen,
Grinnell biology professor. She no-
ted that a membership drive is in
progress this fall and is eager to
see former LEAP members as well
as any other lnterested students.
Meetings are held the second Wed-
nesday oi the month at 7:30 p m.

of discrimination at his establish
ment, and that he felt the incident
was being blown out or proportion

understanding on the part oi his

ready to talk to the girl and apolo—
gize ior the inCldent.

He added that he was not familiar
with the details or the other inci—
dents mentioned ln the CBS coms
plaints, noting that the Longhorn

ploys 45 iull and part time people.

“Did you say Latin American hOs
use? I didn’t know there was one,"
seems to he the general concensus
on campus. “There is little sense
oi the existence of other cultures
on campus,” declared Arturo Tapia,
Coordinator of Latin American ho»
use. He stated that the original
purpose oi the house was “to pro-

_mote campusswide interest in Va

rious aspects oi Latin American
culture,”

Ten students, live male and live
female, live in the house, located
at 1227 Park St. Three oi the res-
idents are Panamanian and the res
maining seven, though American by
birth, have had some exposure to
the Latin American way oi lite.
Senior Katy Puckett, lor example,
spent last semester in Mexico. As
nether student has lived in Argenv
tina, a third in Uruguay, and a
fourth in Costa Rica, All residents

Although all ten students are on
school board plans, they wish to
cook a variety of meals, native to
Latin American countries, several
times each month, Bedrooms in the
house exhibit art objects, maps,
and pictures from several count»
ries. Spanish is often spoken among
the residents.
