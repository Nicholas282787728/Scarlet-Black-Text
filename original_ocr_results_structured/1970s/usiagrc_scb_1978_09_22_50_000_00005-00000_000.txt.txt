Nestleithe very word brings to
mind piles of delicious chocolate
and other good things to cat. In
Third World countries. however,
this isn’t always true in somc of
these countries. the word Nestle
brings to mind visions of hunger.
malnutrition and disease.

For those who do not know.
Nestle. a Sii'isssbascd corporation,
is the largest prodircer in the world
of powdered infant formula.

LIKE MOST multi-
national corporations. began
promoting its product in Third
World countries when the demand
decreased in the West. However.
“hat is In the best interest of a
multinational corporation is not

 

necessarily best for the mothers
and children of developing coun
tries

There are two reasons why a
product which is for the most part
perfectly safe in the West becomes
a potential killer. First. for this
powdered formula to be used
safely. it must be mixed with pure
clean water. and the bottle and
nipplc must be sterilized In the
Third World. uncontaminated
water is rare. Also. luel to purify
the water and sterilize the bottle
and nipple is very expensive and
hard to come by. Furthermore. if
women bottle-feed rather than
breast-feed their babies. their
children lost out on the immunities
provided by mother's milk.

THE SECOND [MASON is that

rntant formula is very expensive
ihe amount needed to properly
nourish one six-month-old baby
can consume up to 62 per cent of a
family's average income. As a re-
sult of «this expense, mothers
water down the formula to extend
the supply. in some cases mothers
have been stretching folirrday cans
to last as long as three weeks The
result of this dilution IS. of course.
malnutrition

The combination of malnutrition
and disease has taken its toll. A
Chilean Study found that three-
monthsold bottle~fed infants had a
death I'llte three times higher than
those led at the breast

THE OliVlOUS question
remains. why. it this formula is so
unhealthy for the babies. do
mothers use it'l There are several
rcasons [or this First of all. there
are some mothers who are unable
to breast-teed. though this group
comprises less than ten per cent of
the women of childbearing age
Nonetheless. there has been a
sharp decrease in the number of
breastfed children In Singapore.
for example. in 71 per cent of
the babies of low come families
were breastfed; by 1971, only five
per cent iicrc. What caused this

Students face Nestle boycott qucStion once again

A majot rcason was and is ad
vertising. The idea behind ad-
vertisulg is to entice people to buy
a product. thereby making a profit
for the corporation regardless of
the consequences to the consumer
ln this respect baby formula IS no
different than razor blades.
However. no sanc person would
make a conscious attempt to get a
suicidal maniac to buy razor
blades Such is not the case in the

baby formula industry
