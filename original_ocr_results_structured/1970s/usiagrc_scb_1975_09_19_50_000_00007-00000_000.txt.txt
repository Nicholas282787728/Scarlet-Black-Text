Acquisitions grow

by Mark Voorhccs

Walking through the Forum,

urling Library, and other areas of
public congregation at Grinnell
College one might notice paintings

Kind drawings on the walls and

‘onder, “How’d they get there?”

' Well, these works of art are the
responsibility of the Committee on
Art Acquisitions headed by the Art
Department Chairman Richard
Cervene.

The committee, consisting of two
students, Dean Waldo S, Walker,
Professor of Mathematics Arnold
Adelberg, a d Assistant Froiessor
of Art w‘ iam w. Wolf, was
designed to make recome
mendations, selections, and pass
judgments on any annexation to

rinnell's permanent art collec-

s‘tion. They review possible gifts and
make purchases or original works
as well. At the present time, 566
items are in the permanent
ollection,

Two alumni, Marie Louise and
Samuel R. Rosenthal, formed a
trust fund which designates $2,500
a year for the committee to use for
operating expenses and pur-
chasing After deducting yearly
operating expenses the group is
left With only about $1,100 to spend
of purchases Last year they were
able to purchase eight items.

‘ The committee inustrely heavily
on donations irom private
collections Cervene noted in a
recent interview that through giits
"he college has acquired “mare

elous things we could not afford or
are no longer on the market,“ He
also remarked that through
donations Grinnell is acquiring

“‘onc of the most distinctive
.éollections in the country for a
small liberal arts college."

One of the two most impressive

recent donations came in the form
of a grant. Grinnell College was
one of ten institutions to receive a
$10,000 stipend from the Charles E.
Merrill Trust, created to “en
courage working artists and
craftsmen." The only restrictions
of the grant are that the artists at
the Works purchased be still living
and productive, and that no single
work purchased should exceed
$1,000. Cervene traveled to San
Francisco, Chicago, and New York
galleries to buy twenty-six works
with this money.

The Rehling Collection of Art is
the second gift, an excellent
collection 01 over 360 works which
were donated on a yearly basis by
Clinton A, Rehling (’39). According
to Cervene, this collection consists
oi “original drawings, paintings,
prins, and sculpture ranging from

'some Greek sculptural pieces

dating from about the fourth
century B.C., on down through
contemporary items by Matisse,
Picasso, Rowalt, and Solo.“
Ccl'vcnc commented that the
committee attempts to make use oi
the artwork in many different
ways. The Rehling Collection was
exhibited as part oi last semester’s
inaugural activities. This year two
shows ieaturing the permanent
Collection are planned: Works on
Paper (a collection of sketches and
drawings), and Works by Women.
In the future Cervene foresees a
circulating exhibit of twenty to
twenty-five objects traveling
around the state as part of
bicentennial celebrations, He also
hopes for some “adequately
deisgned facility and-or renovated
campus building to house, display,

and maintain our developing

collection. ”

All Grinnell women should be
aware of room 113 in Smith Annex.
It houses the Women’s Center, a
{place for women to relax, talk,
iye a cup of coffee, and share
periences. Use of the Center is
just one of the many opportunities
provided by the Women’s Group to
‘meet the various needs of women

“Hopefully irom these groups

feeling," explained Jane Horwitt, a
member of the Steering Committee
of the Women’s Group. she feels
that a re-examination of women's
roles is important at Grinnell, and
that this can best be achieved by
involving many women in a variety
oi ways.

Exotic moloo exhibited

by Paul Stcinbrecher

The collection of rnolas from the
an Bias Islands, compiled by John
eonard. circulated by the
mithsonian Institution, and on
isplay through October )2 in
Scheai‘ier Gallery, is an exotic and
olorful addition to the roster of art
xhibits at Grinnell. These highly
ecorated textile panels are
reated exclusively by the Cuna
ndians oi the San Blas Islands,
ocated Off the northeast coast of
Panama.

The “mola,” originally meaning
imply “cloth” and then used to
eier specifically to the handrsewn
anels, is basically composed oi
everal layers of diiierently
olored cloth cut and sewn in
various patterns to expose the
olors and textures oi each layer.

Since both the actual technique
nd creation oi design are quite
difficult to master, the production
fmolas is begun at an early age in
rder to ensure that a \vellrstocked
rousscau of moles is accumulated

The subject matter IS iully as
varied as the color schemes,
running [rom religious and
mythological scenes to political
endorsements and from studies
from nature to fantastic
representations of spaceships and
automobiles. The choice is
governed by the imagination and
creative capabilities of the artist;

created a greater and greater
demand for handcrafted molas.

The production of the San Blas
molas has not come to the present
day with authenticity fully intact.
Included in the exhibit are a
number of “tourist” molas which
are produced ior sale rather than
[or personal use,

These do not show the same
painstaking craitsmanship and
inventiveness as do the traditional
examples, and it is interesting to
note on the cards that describe the
individual pieces how the Cuna
adapt their crait to please the
naive tourist,

This is a well-organized and
inlormative exhibit which can he
enjoyed either at length or simply
by walking through the gallery and
noticing the impact oi colors and
designs. For those interested in
creating their very own molas,
copies of an instruction sheet are
available from Ms. Davidson in the
Fine Arts Ofﬁce.
