Weekend meets set

by Dave Schechter

Convincing road victories
against the University of Northern
Iowa (76-42) and Luther (7942)
opened up the 1977 portion ol the
women’s swim schedule. This
afternoon finds the University of
Iowa visiting the PEC pool to
challenge coach Mike Daley’s

.quad.

Grinnell's Kathy Keller set pool
records in the 180- and 4607yard
freestyle events at UNI. The
distances are odd because UNI has

SDryard pool, Another pool mark
was set by Pioneer Virginia Munoz
in the 6ﬂryard butterﬂy. Daley had
praise for Ann Cleaver after she
recorded second and third places
in butterﬂy competition.

The highlight of the Luther meet
came at the end as Grinnell's 2007

yard free relay team narrowly.

missed the national s‘ualilying
standard. Keller and Munoz were
joined on the relay quartet by
Becky Chipman and Sheryl
."untoon.
- When Luther placed its top
swimmer in the Individual Medley,
Daley countered by placing Keller
and Munoz in that event. Their
spective ﬁrst and third place
showings negated the Luther
swimmer’s finish.

Twelve women returned early
during vacation for twice-arday
workouts totalling 11,000-12,000
yards, As a result, Daley believes
fatigue has slowed down some of
the women in the sprint events

Tomorrow's Grinnell Relays are
not to be confused wiﬂi the beer
races to be held later this year.
Swimming will be the name of the
game as Rockford College is ex-
pected to battle the Grinnell men
for the title while Augustana and
Wayne State (Nebl also rate
highly among the tield.

Tuesday brings Knox to town as
the Pioneers seek to break the
visitor‘s dual meet win streak
against Grinnell. As the season
winds down, coach Ray Oberr
miller’s thinking is turning
towards the Midwest Conference
championships to be held March 4-
5 in Iowa City. Knox has taken the
ccnlerence title the last two years.

Competition begins at 12:30 pm,
tomorrow at the PEG pool.

Big offense not enough

Men ,cagers drop to 0-9

by Mike Salsich

After a layoff of nearly five
weeks. the men's basketball team
saw its first league action of the
year and dropped two games to
Monmouth and Knox last
weekend.

Last Friday night, playing at
Darby before a sparse crowd, the
Pioneers fell to the Monmouth
Scots, 110790. But the contest was

Wrestlers
nnpressive

at Dubuque

by Bob Meyer

Before winter break, the Grin-
nell wrestling team fought in a dual
meet against Central College and
Iowa Wesleyan. Central, one of the
stronger teams in this area, easily
defeated the Fioneers, 364?. The
Pioneers, however, handily beat
Iowa Wesleyan, 37-18, Rich
Corrigan (150), Mark Lyles (126),
Mark Sokkappa (118) and Gordon
Stacey (134) wrestled extremely
well.

Near the end of winter break,
most oI the wrestling team
returned to Grinnell for a week of
conditioning before the Elmhurst
invitational on Jan 22 in Dubuque.
Only eight of the ten weight classes
were represented by Grinnell at
Elmhurstl Despite this handicap,
the Pioneers finished fifth out of
eleven teams

Freshman Rich Lee placed first
at 158 lbs. and undefeated Gordon
Stacey continued his winning ways
by placing first at 134 lbs David
Greenwald (no) placed second
and captain Hosea Engram,
wrestling for his first time this
year, placed third Frank Corrigan
almost placed at 150 lbs., but a
tough loss in his last match ruined
his opportunity.

Coach Mo Hunt could not have
been more thrilled after his team's
performance at Elmhurst. He said
the squad’s recent performances
are making him look like a coach
with majestic powers. He also
believes that Grinnell “has gotten
rid of the losing attitude which it
had in the past.” After GrinneU’s
performance atElmhurst, where it
finished only ten points behind the
winning team, ‘Hunt is looking
ahead to an extremely successiul
season the rest of the way.

much better than the score in
dicated. “It was a hell of a game,"
stated Grinnell Coach Art
Peterson. “They were a much
bigger and more physical team
than us‘, but if we could have
controlled the boards throughout
the game, we would have won."

The Pioneers jumped out to an
early lead and with the help of a
solid 58 per cent shooting average
led the Scots by three at the half,
50-47. At this point. it seemed as
though the Grinnellians were in
control.

The good showing continued into
the early part of the second half.
With 12 minutes remaining, the
Pioneers had a seven-point lead.

But the complexion of the game
began to change. The Scots. With
their size and strength, began
controlling the boards and
following up missed shots. With
nine minutes remaining, the
Pioneers lost the lead for the first
time in the game and never
regained it,

Grinnell’s Carl Warner put in an
excellent perlormance, scoring to
points and registering a 73 per cent
shooting average. Pioneer Scott

 

20 points and shot 88 per cent from
the iield while pulling down six
rebounds.

Saturday night. the Pioneers
took on Knox College, another
poweriul lllinois squad. The team
put on a good show (or the large
crowd, but fell to the Slwash, 103-
85.

Saturday night‘s contest was
much different from the previous
night’s. Led by Dave Woodward, a
threertime alleleague pick, Knox
used quickness and good hustle to
jump to an early lead.

The battle was fairly even from
that point on. Late in the first
stanza, Grinnell pulled Within five
points, but trailed, 47735, at the
half.

In the second stanza, the
Pioneers put together several
surges, but Knox, using an ef-
fective stall, held off the attacks.

The Grinnellians had a balanced
offense with five players scoring in
double figures, but the team shot
only 40 per cent from the field,
compared to 57 per cent the night
before.

Grinnell is now winless in nine
starts, including an 0-2 division
