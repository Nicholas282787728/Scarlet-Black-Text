Itwas announced this week that
work on the longrawaited Grinnell
‘ﬁnderground Rapid Transit
System (GURTS) will begin in
early June of this year. After a
lengthy debate at their recent
meeting, the Trustees of Grinnell
College voted lo accept the
Famey-Turner plan, which calls
for three separate subway lines to
be constructed over a five-year
period at a cost of 7.4 million
dollars. Part of the cost will be met
by the City of Grinnell and part by
a gift by the Class 01'52, in honor of
their upcoming 25th class reunion.
‘As illustrated in the ac7
‘companying map, GURTS will
service the entire campus as well
as parts of the city The Campus
" me will serve as the “local” line,
,Icarrying the brunt of weekday
traffic, The Town Lille, running in
a northrsouth direction, will make
six station stops, including one in
town at the northwest corner of
Broad Street and Fifth Avenue.
The town station was the major
iactor in winning the support or the
city Council, and the door has been

 

leit open tor further expansion of
the town system. The third and
most Controversial line is the
Cross-Campus “Express" Line.
The CCE Line came under attack
during the Trustees' meeting as
“an unnecessary and un-
warranted expense." The line
survived a close vote after Food
Service Director Dave McConnell
cited increased Forum business as
a probable by-product of the (ICE
Line.

In addition to benefiting the For-
um, the college administration is
banking on GURTS to help Grinnell
in several other areas. President
Turner told the 88:3 that the
transit system “should help foster
a fecling of oneness and joy"
among lnembers of the come
munity “This type of largerscale
project will provide a valuable
learning experience and much
positive input,” he added Turner
has already begun to recruit
students to paint subway entrances
and compose poetry for the
dedication ceremonies,

Tom Latimer feels that the Town
Line will boost attendance at

campus athletic and cultural
events John Hopkins hopes that
”the more ui'banroriented student"
will now be attracted to Grinnell,
And Pub management is happy
with the planned Quad interchange
(see map), which they believe will
draw new members into their
establishment Many students say
that the easier, lastcr access the
system provides to dorms,
classrooms, dining halls and
laundry rooms will be immediately
appreciated,

Some opposition to GURTS rrom
environmentalists and other critics
was expected to surface at the two
public hearings held last fall, But
despite what the administration
called “frequent announcements
and reminders to the community,"
the hearings were sparsely at
tended and the expected opposition
did not arise.

Melvin Famey, chiefarchitect of
GURTS. is excited about beginning
work this summer. “Working with
a small gauge line and under a
tight budget will be a new
challenge [or me," says Famey.

previously was one of the very few
high officials to have Served in key
positions in both the Johnson and
Nixon administrations.
‘After teaching government at
Harvard, Halperin went to
Washington in 1966 where he
became a principal adviser to
Robert McNamara as Deputy
Assistant Secretary of Defense for
International Security Affairs. His
primary assignment was to set up
the Strategic Armaments
Limitations Talks with the Soviet
Union. He was noticed by‘ Henry
Kissinger who asked him to join
the Nixon White House National
Security Council Senior Staff with
responsibility ior planning.
Halperin became rapidly
disillusioned with the Nixon Viet
Nam policies and resigned on
September 20, 1969. over the ex-
pressed protest of Kissinger,
Four months before Halperin‘s
resignation and unbeknownst to
him, President Nixon had ordered
a warrantless national security
wiretap to be made of Halperin's

home telephone. The apparent
purpose was to determine if
Halperin was responsible for some
highly embarrassing foreign policy
new leaks.

Even though no improper
conduct was detected, ,the
wiretap was continued until
February 12. 1971, 16 months after
Halperin had left government
service. At the time of the Cam-
bodian invasions in June 1970, J.
Edgar Hoover even gathered up
the logs of the Halperin phone
conversations, 21 per cent of which
were between Halperin and his
wife, and took them over to the
White House for Nixon's perusal
The wiretap was only discontinued
after Hoover threatened to blow
the whistle to Congress

After Halperin found out about
the mps during the Watergate
investigation he sued Nixon,
Kissinger and company. This past
December he won his case, though
the damages have not yet been

assessed.

House, he went to work for the
Brookings Institution to
Washington think tank) as a senior
tellow in the foreign policy section
where he wrote a number of books
and articles, including his
Bureaucratic Politics and Foreign
Policy and United States Japanese
Relation: Tile 1970's. He went from
Brookings in 1974 to direct a study
for the Twentieth Century Fund on
Information, NationalSeCuriiy and
Constitutional process.

Currently he is directing a
project on National Security and
Civil Liberties jointly sponsored by
the ACLU foundation and Center
for National Security Studies of the
Fund for Peace, This project
engages in a number of activities
designed to prevent spurious
claims of “national security” from
being used to erode constitutional
procedures or civil liberties. It has
filed more than 50 requests tor
documents under the Freedom of
Information Act and has followed
up with more than a dozen
lawsuits. Halperin has also

testified before a number of
Congressional committees on
issues related to the activities of
the project including covert inr
telligence operations, wiretaps,
and Congressional oversight. Some
of you may also know him as the
Foreign Affairs analyst on
National Public Radio program All
Things Considered.

In his first lecture on Monday,
April 4 at 3 p m. in Herrick Chapel,
Mr, Halperin will. discuss the
moral dimension of American
foreign policy. In his second lec-
ture, on Tuesday, April 5, also at 3
pm, in Herrick, he will talk on the
military and defense dimension.
He will also lead an informal
discussion on the Carter foreign
policy at 3:30 p.m. Tuesday in
South Lounge.

I know of few people better
qualified to address the question of
American foreign policymaking or
the abuses oi recent years. He
clearly has much or importance to
say to all of us. 1 hope you will take
the opportunity to hear him.
