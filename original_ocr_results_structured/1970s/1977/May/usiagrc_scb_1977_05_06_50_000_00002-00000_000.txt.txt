candidates that come to the campus for interviews.

small number of majors (eight),
the faculty preferred to deal
directly with the majors and by-
pass the EPC. He said the French
EPC in its present capacity has no
function.

There was a difference of opinion
among economics EPC members
regarding the amount of
cooperation they received from the
faculty. EPC members Dave
Chroust and Wade Lee praised the
economics faculty for its interest in
the opinions of the EPC, while EPC
member Dan Finkelman criticized
them. stating that the EPC is
“listened to but not highly
regarded." He went on to say that
the EPC is presently “not carrying
enough weight in influencing the
outcome” of departmental
decisions.

One of the most pressing
problems confronting the present
EPC system, according to a large
number of EPC members, is the
high level of apathy on the part of
the majors. This appears to be
most prevalent in the larger
departments, Most EPC members
interviewed felt that the vast
majority of majors in their
department simply were not in-
terested in the workings of their
EPC.

Many EPC members cited
poorly attended majors meetings
as evidence of this lack of interest,
History EPC member Barb Straus
recalled that one history majors
meeting attracted only ten
students out of more than 90
history majors on campus. Chroust
of the economics EPC noted that
there was a general “apathy

An amendment to fund the In-
stitutionalized Grapevine for next
fall was narrowly accepted as SGA
president Ruth Montgomery broke
a tie vote Though no money for the
publication was recommended by
the Finance Committee, $400 from
a budget carryover is alloted to the
Grapevine. Advocates of the
amendment argued that headway
had been made in reevaluating the
Grapevine through modest
proposals to improve is response
rate and validity. These proposals
strive to increase response rate by
providing a more coherent and
simplified format for the
questionnaire, Amendment ops
ponents claimed that benefib of
the Grapevine were not substantial
enough to justify the 3400 ex-
penditure.

The final amendment concerned
the allocation of funds that would
come in next year if admissions
are higher than expected, The first
$750 will go into the general budget
reserves. The next $800 will go for

among economics majors." He
said that majors meetings have
been “poorly attended.” and that
he felt that the majority of
economics majors were “not ens
thusiastic" in their support of the
EPC.

American Studies EPC member
Kit Wall commented, “Most of our
problems lie with the apathy of the
majors. Very few show up at
meetings . , . very few have taken
an interest in What we're doing.”

According to the survey, some
EPC members, especially those
from smaller departments, felt
that there is adequate informal
communication between EPC
members and the majors con
cerning departmental matters.
Physics EPC member Carl Op»
pedahl explained that due to the
small number of majors in his
department (approximately ten).
most of his contact With physics
majors concerning EPC functions
was conducted in “informal
discussions ” Similar responses
were received from members of
the German, art, Russian,
philosophy, music. classics and
anthropology EPCS.

Most of the interviewing for this
survey was conducted before Dean
Waldo Walker revealed his
proposed set of guidelines
governing EPC functions. His set
of guidelines were subsequently
passed by the Executive Council
(5&3, $29777). Many of those EPC
members interviewed, however.
had suggestions of their own which
mey felt would improve the efr
fectiveness of the EPC system.

Physics EPC member John

it
Liming echoed the sentiments of' a
number of EPC members in-
terviewed by suggesting My?
guidelines delineating the righ
and duties of each EPC be
determined within each individual
department.

Manv EEC members in-
terviewed also felt that EPCS
should have a formal vote in all
departmental matters, though
there was little consensus on how
much weight their vote should
have. Suggstions ranged from
gi ng the EPC members in-
dividual votes on par with the
faculty to giving the entire EP .
one “token vote" by which ti
could register their opinion in a
formal capacity. A smaller
number of EPC members
Suggested that EPCS be given V_
power over all faculty decisi ‘s
within the department,

Conversely, a few of the are
members interviewed suggested
that the system be abolished. They
argued that the EPC system had no
true function other than serving as
an administrative concession to
“power hungry" students.

The most common suggestion to
increase EPC-majors contact was
for the EPC to put out a monthly
“newsletter" informing all majors
of the EPC activities. Other
suggestions to increase contact
between majors and EPC m a
bers included having more social
functions and majors meetings.
One EPC member even suggested
that attendance at majo -
meetings he made mandatory a

 

way to combat apathy among the
majors,

amendments pass

will go formoviest lt was agreed
that money above $1350 will go into
hall funds.

All three constitutional amends
ments were passed by a margin
that was over the do per cent
majority required for ratificatlon,

The first amendment passed
specifies that hall representatives
who miss one roll call vote for
three consecutive joint board
meetings or five meetings in a
semester and who do not send an
alternate are thought to have
resigned.

The second amendment, which
changes the term of office for all
hall and off-campus represen-
tatives and coordinators to one
semester, is daigned to increases
the accountability of repres g
tatives to their constituencies.

The third amendment grants the
Judicial Council final jurisdiction
over Violations of electio -
guidelines and other improp ‘

would also Certify or throw out the
results of an election on the basis of
the resolution of the election
violation charges.
