“Beer survey"

The Grinnell chapter of the iowa Public Interest Research Group
tlowaPIRG) recently announced the findings of what was
referred to as a “beer survey.” Grocers in Grinnell were surveyed
to determine which ones carry beer in returnable bottles, and, if so,
what the prices are and what brands are available.

Three stores, Heree, Jerry‘s Bero, and McNally's. sell beer in
returnable bottles. and the Kwik Shop will order it upon request,

The Research Group stressed the advantages of buying
beverages in returnable bottles. Beer purchased in this manner
costs less for the consumer, $1.50 for six beers in
returnables as compared to 81,70 for a six pack of throwaways,
because packaging in throwaway containers is approximately five
times as expensive as in reusables.

The positive envirﬂnrnental impact is great, for less energy is
used for production, fewer raw materials are consumed, the litter
problem is lessened, and the amount of garbage being plowed into
the earth at the sanimry landfills is decreased when containers are
reused.

Theatre production

The theatre production performance of the ”Chairs," by Eugene
Ionesco and “Lovers," by Harold Pinter will be performed
Tuesday through Friday in Arena Theatre at a pm. Karl Har-
shbarger, theatre professor, is directing the production.

“Bottle-bill”

An important issue now being considered by the Iowa State
Legislature is the so called “bottlebill ” This bill is part of a
beginning nationwide movement to ban non-returnable. non-
refillable bottles,

Each year 60 to 80 billion throwaway containers are produced
nationally. They total 9 million tons of potentially re-usable trash.
Nationally, beverage containers constitute 20 to 40 per cent of all
ilitter, In Iowa however, according to the U.S. Department of
Commerce, containers cause 70 to 80 per cent of the litter problems.
The “bottle bill” would reduce Iowa’s litter by approximately 85
per cent.

it is also expected that the bill would conserve energy, produce
jobs and save basic national resources. To comment about the bill
write to Grinnell’s Senator Joan Orr and Representative Emil
Husack in care of the State House. Des Moines, Ia.

I Scott-Heron: change undervvay .e

by Pico Brown
The music of Gil Scott-Heron and
the Midnight band, which some of
you experienced in Roberts
Theatre Saturday night, brings to
light an innovative facet of musical
communication relating the need

for social and political revolution,
Their messages are woven in an
interesting blend of “blues.
classics, gospel and bebop," which
is intended to appeal to all listeners
of this band’s music.

Spirituality is inherent in the
Midnight band. Tile drum, the
basic instrument of rhythm, is the
mainstay, The aforementioned
ingredients of the music of this
band also contribute to the
spiritual effect of the music. These
ingrediens, explained Gil in a

Blacks

tcoiitinued from p. it

Financial aid was especially ime
portant to many. Because blacks
often come from lower income
levels than whites, financial aid is
a key factor in attracting blacks.

But along with questions about
Grinnell’s isolation, athletics,
counseling and other matters, all
of which whites would also be in
terested in, many prospectives
were concerned about what it
would be like to be black at
Grinnell. The small number of
black students and faculty
members at Grinnell was a worry
expressed by several prospectives.
The students also had various
thoughts on the college’s black
white relationships. Although one
prospective said he thought
relations were “not very good irom
what I saw,” another commented,
that whites “looked at me like I
was a person, The fact that l was a
black didn't matter.”

Hopkins thinks it is important for
Grinnell to make efforts such as
the Prospectives Weekend to bring
students to campus for whom
college visits are expensive or hard
to arrange. He stressed, however,
that he does not think the Weekend,
nor any of Grinnell’s admissions

KDIC interview, are earthy, basic
elements which provide a medium
for the band's spiritual message,

What is the band's spiritual
message? Basically, it is change—
a revolutionvif you will, Gil men-
tions several examples of the need
for change. Education of the
young, re-education ol' the older is
necessary; such topics as sex and
drugs need to be emphasized, Gil
said that another area needy of
change is that or social priorities.
Instead of dealing with problems
on a national level, Gil and his
band appeal for a switch to com-
munity and personal priority and
working outwards.

A revolution is going on at this
time, says Gil, but its effects are
apparent to only those who will
look beyond themselves and their
experiences. Wellrversed in black
history and the status of African
nations. Gil cites examples of
Third World nations on the rise.
Developing this awareness oi
revolution is part of the purpose of
the band’s music, And Students,
according to Gil, are the vanguard
of this revolution. “As educators,
as members of the generation who
paid the dues, we’re supposed to
make sure that the ones who come
after us don‘t pay the dues.”

The music which is the medium
of these social messages is jazz.
Gil, along with pianist Brian
Jackson, creates the simple yet
elegant chord structures on which
the music is based, The thick
percussion of Reggie Brisbane and
Barney Williams propels every
song, while hornsmen Delbert
Taylor and BilalsunnieAli produce

policies, give “special treatment"
to blacks and not to whites.
Several blacks on campus have
expressed the opinion that Grin-
nell’s admissions poli ies are
geared toward attracting a dif»
[erent kind of black student than in
previous years. Said Greg Wiggins,
a black, “There's a definite change
in the black community. I can see
that Grinnell is now picking an
ideal type of black student. They're
looking at applications and looking
for a person that is higher up on
SAT scores and from a welleknown
school. They’re looking for
someone that they think can adapt

some of the most innovative brass

and woodwind n'ifs around. Bassisth

Danny Bowers fills in the bottom,
and the vocal talents of Gil and
composer-singer Victor Brown
complete the scene. Liie ex»
periences are the basis and in
spiration for the Midnight band’s
music.

A successful European tour, and
unexpectedly high record sales
have made Gil Scott-Heron ope
timistic about the future of the
Midnight band. As the individual
musicians of the band develop
musically. Gil said that he expects
more compositional input irom the
band members as well as in-
dividual projects.

to Grinnell instead of looking for
someone that has the potential to
make it in Grinnell and giving that
student a chance,"

Lee stated, “The administration“.

has decided to recruit a different
type of black student. It wants
more blacks from prep school type
backgrounds and blacks who ar
used to being around whites, It i
no longer recruiting blacks from
noneGrinnell academic
backgrounds, such as inner-city
blacks ”

Hopkins said neither Wiggins’
nor Lee’s View of Grinnell’s black
recruitment Was accurate.
