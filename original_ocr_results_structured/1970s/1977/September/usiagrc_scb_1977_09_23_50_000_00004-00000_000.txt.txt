Initiate proxy
vs. apartheid

Grinnell students Jon Neiderbach and Jim Stuart are
working to bring attention to the question of whether or not
Grinnell should have investments in businesses that operate
in South Africa.

> It ‘is an interesting matter and raises some difficult
questions: What right do nations have to try to influence the
domestic policies of other nations? And if they do have a
right, are there right and wrong ways of applying this in-
ﬂuence?

NEIDERBACH and Stuart are calling for Grinnell to
divest itself of its investments in businesses operating in
South Africa in an effort to encourage those businesses to
apply pressure on the South African government to end
apartheid. We believe that on a matter such as apartheid—a
matter which should offend our morals more than our
politics—other countries have a right and an obligation to
exert inﬂuence on the offending country. And we believe that
pressure through businesses is an acceptable way to exert
such inﬂuence

However, we do not believe that divestiture is the answer.
There are numerous reasons for this:

1] Extensive, continued acquisition of revenue from in-
vestments is a high priority necessity for the survival of the
college.

2| LOCATING new, equally profitable businesses for
reinvestment that have no ties to South Africa will present
problems.

3) Unless divestiture is massive, divested shares in cor-
porations, many of which are blue chip, will be repurchased,
thus not affecting corporations in important ways.

4) Businesses in South Africa often oppose the existing
government, meaning that any weakening of businesses—
and here we are granting the extremely unlikely condition
that divestiture will hurt businessesimight actually aid the

present leadership.
INSTEAD OF divestiture, we call for the Grinnell Board

of Trustees to initiate proxy votes among stockholders of
each corporation in the Grinnell portfolio that operates in
South Africa. This resolution should call for each corporation
to employ an integrated work force (with equal social
benefits for blacks and whitesl and to ACTIVELY work to
oppose the existing apartheid policy.

A resolution calling for corporate withdrawal from South
Africa is unsatisfactory for generally the same reasons that
divestiture is unsatisfactory.

OUR SUGGESTED proxy action, if widely followed by
stockholders of other businesses operating in South Africa,
will lead to effective pressure via businesses to end apar-
theid. Apartheid is a violation of the human rights of black
South Africans (see article on page one) and should be
morally offensive to everyone. Grinnell, as an institution
interested in liberal education and reform should strive to
combat apartheid.

Neiderbach and Stuart deserve praise for working to bring
attention to this issue and for supporting application of anti-
apartheid pressure through businesses. The Tmstees should
continue this cause via proxy action.

Gold Turkey

Be wary of color film offer

To the Editor: I’ve noted that a
number of ads are posted on
campus which offer a low cost
color negative film from a com-
pany called American Passage.
located in Seattle, Washington,
They offer 35mm still camera
loads of Eastman Color Negative II
Film 5247 and will process the
negatives and print positive slides
for less cost than Kodak charges
just for processing normal slide
films such as Kodachrome and
Ektachrome. .

Costs aside, there are
significant disadvantages to using
5247 for still photography that
consumers should be aware of:

1) Eastman 5247 film is color
balanced for tungsten light (with
an ASA of 100) and will not give
proper color rendition when in
daylight or with flashbulbs or
electronic ﬂash unless a No. B5
filter is placed over the camera
lens, Use of the filter lowers the
effective ASA to 64

2) 5247 negatives have relatively
poor dye storage stability under
typical conditions; that is, the
negatives will fade more rapidly
than most other films. Slides made
from 5247 are printed on Eastman
color print film which is designed
for fractional-second exposure to
light in a notion picture projecs
torethe slides Will fade rapidly
when subjected to the long ex-

 

posures typically used with slide
projectors. The print film slides
will also fade in dark storage much
more rapidly than any of the
present Kodak slide films or slide
duplicating films. Thus, in
relatively few years, the user of
5247 will have neither slides nor
usable negatives.

3) 5247 is intended for use by the
professional motion-picture in-
dustry and most major Hollywood
productions are now photographed
with this film, The film should be
stored at 55F or lower prior to
exposure and should be processed
at once following exposure if
proper color balance is to be
maintained. Still photographers
are unlikely to be able to meet
these requirements, particularly if
the film must be sent to and from
Seattle. 5247 film and processing
services for still photography have
in recent years been offered by a
number of motionrpicture
processing labs or other companies
acting as fronts for the processors.
They process the film on their
equipment during slack periods
when there is no motion picture
work to be done Kodak has never
sold 5247 in 35mm still camera
loads; the film is “respooled” from
long loads by the processors. Slides
printed from the same film used to
make the theater prints you see
when you go to the movies—this

 

film usually is physically worn out
(scratches, dust marks, etc.)
during repeated theater projection
before dye fading becomes a
problem. The print films are also
color balanced for use in carbon-
arc theater projectors and will not
give proper color balance in slide
projectors.

4) If slides are desired, the most
stable of all currently available
color films is Kodachrome film;
this film also has the finest grain
and highest resolution of all color
films intended for normal
photography. If negatives are
desired for making color prints,
Kodacolor II or Vericolor I! would
generally be advised. In Grinnell,
Vericolor II can be purchased a!
Cunningham urug Store. To be
assured of correct processing fur
best filln dye stability, films should
be processed by Kodak instead of
the lower priced services available
from other labsi Kodak processing
is available on request from
Cunningham Drug Store.
Kodachrome slide film is
significantly more stable than any
currently available color negative
film.

KODAK never intended 5247 film
or Eastman Color Print Film to be
used in Still photography ap-
plications and has never advocated
such use Henry Wilheim

 

 

Open Space

By Charles Davis and the
Concerned Black Students

We, the Concerned Black
Students (CBS) of Grinnell College
and professor Charles Davis,
Chairman of the Black Studies
Program, have decided that it is
time to voice our disenchantment
and to lake our case to “higher

and faculty support.

Our dissatisfaction stems from
three basic sources: 1) the HP

other nonnvhrle faculty at Grinnell
