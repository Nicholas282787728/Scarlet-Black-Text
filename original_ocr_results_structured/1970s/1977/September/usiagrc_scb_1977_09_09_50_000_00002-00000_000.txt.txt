Passes by wide margins

SGA passes affirmative
action statement

By Kathy Willhoite

The Student Government
Association adopted a statement
on the implementation of the Afr
firmative Action Program at
Grinnell College Wednesday
evening.

The statement on Affirmative
Action, which was originally
written and proposed by SGA
president Jon Neiderbach,
weathered a proposal for tabling
and a motion of separation at the
meeting Wednesday to become the
official statement of the SGA. The
proposal passed 19 to one for the
fiist half of the proposal and 16 to
four for the second half.

THE STATEMENT urges
Compliance with the Affirmative
Action Program adopted by
Grinnell and endorsed by the
laculty last May. The SGA
proposes to “keep tabs on each
department’s compliance with the
Program” and to “bring the
pressure of the lull college com-
munityagainstallmajorviolations
of the Affirmative Action
Procedures,”

SGA’s statement also en-
courages the Affirmative Action
Advisory Committee to adopt more
stringent goals for hiring faculty
than the present goals of 20 per
cent iemale, and three per cent
minority immediately and 25 per
cent female and five per cent
minority in five years.

IN ADDITION, the SGA proposal
encourages a similar Affirmative
Action policy to be implemented in
the admissions and financial aid
departments.

The Affirmative Action
Statement gives joint board
support in setting up workshops on
Affirmative Action compliance,

Doubts and conflicts concerning
the adoption or the statement were
prevalent in SGA, Neiderbach feels
that, although the Affirmative
Action Program has been adopted,
actual implementation oi the
program must still be pushed for.
“The only reason it (the At-
fimiative Action Program) was
ever approved was because there
was a demand for it," he said. “If
the demand dies, then it won‘t be
enforced."

One outspoken SGA member,
Cornell Rudov, termed the SGA
statement as Hnot inclusive
enough.” He said ”It restates the
problems, but it offers no
solutions.” SGA member Bob
Greenberg agreed. “it won’t do

an thing.” he said.

table the statement came from

strong enough. Rudov proposed at
last Wednesday‘s meeting to “Wait
and come up with a policy, a
statement that is strong.” Other
members agreed that pointing out
specific vulnerable areas would
give the statement more impact.

Yet other SGA members
prevailed in the opinion that the
time to act and pass the statement
was last Wednesday night, Said
Linda Cornelius, SGA vice
president, “It‘s important to vote
now and let the administration
know how SGA feels.”

RUDOV and Greenberg are
among those who fear the Al'-

that the program is designed to
attract qualified people who have
been historically deprived of such
jobs. Although he denied that there
will be any problem attracting
women to Grinnell, he admitted
that attracting minorities may be a
problem.

GRINNELL‘S Affirmative
Action Program was endorsed by
the laculty last spring only after a
major conﬂict occurred here last
year, In an “administrative
reorganization,” three women who
were cIose to students were fired.
The result was a student uproar
protesting the iirings for three

firmative Action Program itself
will be impossible to carry out.
Greenberg expressed doubt that it
will be possible to attract
minorities to Grinnell where the
minority population is small and
there is no black studies program.
Rudov said. “It's hard to find good
black profs \Vith Ph,D.'S willing to
come to Grinnell.“

Neiderbach defends his
proposal with the observation that.
although women constitute over
half the population, only a small
percentage of the faculty here are
women. “The Affirmative Action
Program does not have anything to
do with hiring low-qualified
people," he commented to SGA
members at the Aug. 31 joint
boards meeting. He went on to say

main reasons: the administration
apparently did not consult enough
Students about the decrsion, a
decline in social and cultural
programs as a direct result of the
filings was feared, and all of the
people fired were women.

Subsequently, after much
controversy and turmoil. two of the
women, Georgia Dentel, Social
Activities Counselor, and Kathy
McCluskey of the GORP and PE
programs, were rehired, but with a
cut in pay.

As a result oi pressure on the
administration, particularly
student pressure, Grinnell adopted
an Affirmative Action Program
which encourages the hiring of
women and minority faculty

reviews in publications such as
Yale University’s Insider‘s Guide
to Colleges. This has helped to
build the reputation of Grinnell,
according to Hopkins. Parents are
also interested in the endowment of
a particular college and many
decisions to attend Grinnell,
Hopkins says, are made because of
the large endowment here.

TlIEltE HAS also been a 2U pen

cent increase in participation by
students in recruitment efforts
over past years. A reason,
Hopkins. feels, Grinnell inﬂuences
prospectives is because most
students here support the college.
Students, he believes, are very
satisfied with the school. If they
were dissatisfied, the reputation of
Grinnell would be affected
negatively.
