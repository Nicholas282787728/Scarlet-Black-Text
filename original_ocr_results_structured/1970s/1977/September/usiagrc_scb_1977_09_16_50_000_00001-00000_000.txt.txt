”Ut111ty, admissions costs help causédéfiéitm

By Tom Pantea

Unexpected utility rate in
creases and added admission costs
are just two areas that, according
to Dean Waldo Walker, are con-
tributing to a budget deficit for the
college of approximately $246,000.

Although Walker voiced Concern
about the deficit, be emphasized
that “the deficit does not
necessarily indicate that the
college is in any dire straights,"

The deficit is occuring in the
annual operating fund which in-
cludes the regular yearly costs to
the college. Many of these costs are
highly unpredictable. when
Walker began to develop this
year’s budget last October he was
told by the utility companies that
prices would increase by about 15
per cent, However, as of now,
increases have been running at

about 27723 per cent over last
year’s figures. A new, expanded
recruiting program caused
inaccurate calculations of costs in
admissions as well. Also, an ad-
ditional $70,000 went toward
salaries because of a need to in»
crease the number of assistants in
the writing lab and to hire teachers
in the overloaded math depart-
ment,

MAINTENANCE and
renovations taking place on
campus also create problems in
calculating accurate budget
figures. A new finish on the PEG
floor created an unexpected ex»
pense that contributed to the
deﬁcit. Walker states that unan-
ticipated renovations, which are
impossible to budget for, con-
stantly threaten to add to a deficit.
if new roofs are needed during a

Scarlet & Blac

year, it will cost between $10,000
for a Forum root and $15,000 for a
new roof on Burling Library.

Although the college is now
runninga deficit of $246,000, it does
not mean that the books will be
closed in June showing a deficit of
that amount. As with expenditures,
incoming revenue is also difficult
to predict, Last October Walker
based his budget on the assumption
that enrollment would be 1180. AS
of now, enrollment stands at about
lZDO. This increase over the
estimate creates about $100,000
that will go towards decreasing the
Size of the deficit.

PRESIDENT A. Richard Turner
also emphasized that between now
and June many other variables
may came a decrease in the
deficit. The exact amount of
financial aid to be awarded second

semester will not be known until
February. Also, if the upcoming
winter is milder than expected,
there will be a savings‘of thousands
of dollars on heating costs,

At this point, Turner does not
seem very worried. “Of course we
are really tight and we are going to
be nasty to people who want a
thousand here and a thousand
there, but With Very careful
monitoring and adjustment we
hopefully will come into balance."

He went on to explain that
February, when half of the budget
is spent, will be the crucial time for
evaluation. It is at this point that
steps may have to be taken if the
deficit does not decrease as
planned. Cuts, Turner said, will not
take place in salaries or individual
budgets of departments, which are

step that could be taken it money
is not available, is the elimination
of low priority B at c. proiects.
Finally, Walker explained that the
college has quasiendownment
money that can be used for
operating costs ll it is needed,

A deficit at this time of the year
in the operating budget is not a new
occurence at Grinnell. Last year,
there was a $40,000 deﬁcit and in
1973 a similar sized deficit 06»
curred. , The school's usual
avoidance of red ink and the small
size of the deficits that have 0c»
cured (compared to the $3.5 million
budget that is being worked with)
are indicators of the financial
strength of Grinnell as compared

l to many of its sister schools in the
ACM system, which consistently
run deficits,

SGA passes budget,
creates new positions

By Kathy Willhoite

The Student Government
Association approved the budget
for the first-semester of ﬁle 1977-75
school year at the Joint Boards
meeting last Wednesday evening.

The S.G.A. budget was {ore
mulated and proposed by treasurer
Wayne Passmore. The budget
passed, fairly intact, after two
amendments. bya vote ofzi to two.

THE major change in the budget
is the addition of two new ad-
ministrative positions, the
Community Affairs Coordinator
and the Academic Affairs Coors
dinator. Although there was some
opposition by S.G.A. members to
the creation of the latter position,
an amendment to eliminate the
Academic Affairs Coordinator
was'voted down nine to 15.

Both the Academic Affairs
Coordinator and the Community
Affairs Coordinator will be
assistants to the vice president:
The Community Affairs Coor-
dinator’s main purpose will be to
promote ”better relations between
the students of Grinnell College
and the town of Grinnell,"

, THE purpose of the Academic
Affairs Coordinator will be to
“facilitate the involvement of the
SGA. in the educational policy of
Grinnell College.” The coor»
dinator’s job entails managing the
Educational Policy Committees of
each department, maintaining
liaison with the Curricular Come
mittee, sponsoring student
research grants, writing the
history of Grinnell educational
policy. and communicating with
the faculty about academic ade
vising.

President Jon Neiderbach
considers the formation of the
Academic Affairs Coordinator a
step toward more S.GiA, in-
volvement in political and
curricular affairs, “Academic
affairs are just as, if not more,
important than social or service
projects,” said Neiderbach.
“We’re entering a new resurgence
of political activism, and it’s time
for our S.G.A’s emphasis to reﬂect
that in all areas of. . policy;
making, and one area is staffing,”

 

Neiderbach said that the Academic
Affairs Coordinator Will be held
accountable for S.G.A. in

volvement in campus 'political‘

areas.

OTHER budget changes include
ssoa-year raises for the S.G.A.
positions of vice president,
treasurer, administrative
assistant, and auditor, as well as a
Wars-year raise for the assistant
student coordinator.

The S.G.A. budget totals $42,200.
Besides the salaries of S.G.A.
administration, expenditures
include social programs such as
concerts, movies, speakers, the
initiative lurid, hall funds, and
media.

ALSO at the meeting Wede
nesday, a committee of seven
students was elected to formulate
an S.G.A. policy on alcohol, to be
presented at the Joint Boards
meeting October 5. The committee
consists of President Jon
Neiderbach, hall representatives
Kim Brydon, Gregg Edwards, Bob
Greenberg, Sue Menge, Steve
Meyer, and Greg Smith.

Although an ST(LAi alcohol
policy was never adopted last year,
some Grinnellians, due to campus
damage attributed to on-campus
events, feel there is a need to set up
alcohol guidelines

THE alcohol controversy in
cludes the question of how much, if
any, S.G.A. money should be ap
propriated to halls for the purchase
of alcoholic beverages. Some
S.G,A. members note the
necessity of providing adequate
non-alcoholic as well as alcoholic
beverages at parties. The S.G.A.
committee on alcohol policy will
also discuss establishing
educational facilities on alcohol as
well as services for those with
alcohol problems.

At a special Joint Boards
meeting last Sunday night, Sep
tember 10, members of the SGA
studentrfaculty committees were
confirmed.

THE initiative fund will be one
topic of discussion at the next
S.G.A. Joint Boards meeting
Tuesday, September 20, at 7:30
pm.

UMW: disarray in the coalfields

Harlan County, U.s.A,, an
outsiders look at the United Mine
Workers’ bitter struggle to
organize the Brookside mine in the
coalfields of eastern Kentucky,
brought out several issues and
events of vital importance to the
future of the mine workers’ union
and the quality of life in the
coaliields.

Nevertheless, the film, which
appeared here last week, depicted
mostly an anachronism: a battle
between the union and the coal
companies in a dingy, poverty-
stricken company town. Except for
a few places in Eastern Kentucky,
long considered the poorest and
most “backward” region in Apr
palachia, company-owned coal
camps and blatant violations of
safety and criminal laws are a
thing of the past. Hardsfought
organizing strikes like the one at
Brookside are even more rare.
Throughout the eastern Coalfields,
the UMW is an accepted institution
and has taken its place among the
powers that be, wielding cone

some areas,

THE BKOOKSIDE strike was a
sobering tragedy, but it was an
isolated, local tragedy which is
rapidly becoming outdated The
true tragedy of the miners and
their families, a tragedy that the
film only hinted at. is the spectacle
of a union torn within itself,
fighting against no powerful exV
temal enemy but against intemal
factions and divisions. The United
Mine Workers union is losing its
grip on the coallields and is
destroying the solidarity that gave
it its strength. This is a tragedy
that potentially far overshadows
the turmoil of any local organizing
strike.

The union‘s current problems
arose from the victory of the
Miners for Democracy movement
in um and me end of the corrupt
Boyle era, a period which was
in
completely in the movie, The
victory of Arnold Miller and his
reform slate opened up the union to

participatory democracy by the
rank and file and allowed greater
local union autonomy. Unac-
customed to the exercise of free
speech and democracy, the union
miners tended to oveneact to their
newly won freedom, which made it
extremely difficult for Miller to
demonstrate any control over the
membership.

THE WEAKNESS of Miller's
authority was revealed in the
Wildcat strike that resulted from
the absence of a rightrtostrike
clause in the i974 national con-
tract. Miller’s attitude toward the
strikers was ambivalent, and he
seemed unable to inﬂuence them to
go back to work, in addition to
alienating the members of the so
called right~toestrike movement,
Miller’s handling of the strike
worsened his rivalry with holdover
union officials from the Boyle
years, most of whom were cons
centrated in the union's lEB
