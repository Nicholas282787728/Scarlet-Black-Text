 

Win relieves
frustration

byBob Meyer

Tanned, starved. unclean and
frustrated are approprlate ad-
jectives describing the Pioneer
baseball team after their four to
five day stay in Ranger, Texas
over spring break, The iirst
Saturday after break, the Pioneers
began their league competition
against Cornell After four hours of

ﬁaseball, frustration set in once
again as the Pioneers dropped
their two openers, 0710 and 4-5. The
second game was pitched Well by

aTom Richmond who unfortunately
lost because of fielding errors and
numerous walks

The following Thursday Grinnell
played Simpson College and lost, 4-
2. Grinnell had only three hits: a
Single by John O'Hern, double by
Charley Gogel and a home run by
Kurt Kohlman. Don Petrich pits
ched extremely well in his first
outing as he blazed the ball past
Simpson and held them to only two
hits Like Richmond, errors and
occasional pitching control
problems were
Grinnell's misfortune

This past Tuesday Grinnell
‘ rove three hours down to
Lamona, Iowa to play Graceland
College. Graceland trounced the
Pioneers in the opener, ll~l. in the

{proud game, Grinnell surprised
everyone but themselves.

With Richmond back on the
mound, the Pioneers again held
their opponents to a minimal
amount of hits, Strikeouts and
good defense stymied Graceland
throughput the game. Hitting

' responsible for '

 

finally returned to Grinnell
baseball as the Pioneers got seven
hits. all of them singles Clutch
hitting was performed by Paul
DeLaney, Paul Crane, Jeff Lin»

,dholm, and Charley Gogel.

The Pioneers, tied going into the
seventh inning, scored three runs
in the seventh and had a 52 lead.
After six strong innings, Richmond
finally proved himself to be mortal
as he weakened in the bottom of
the seventh. After Richmond gave
up a solo homer and loaded the
bases, Coach John Pfitsch
replaced him with veteran Chris
Sodoma. Sodoma, entering the

game with the bases loaded and '

only one out, stopped his first
hitter with ease. The Second hitter
he faced walked on five pitches.
With Grinnell then only one run on
top, Sodoma had the unwanted
pleasure of facing Graceland's
best hitter‘a man who had hit five
homers In his last three games.
Sodoma. keeping the ball low,
forced Graceland’s hitter to hit the
ball on the ground, The ball, hit
sharply, returned back to the
mound and Soduma’s groin, and
was then easily picked up for a
force-out at first“ Thus, Grinnell
baseball dramatically won its first
game of the season by the score of
54.

Tomorrow Grinnell plays its first
home game of the year against
Cornell. With frustration finally
rooted out, Coach Pfitsch and his
players look positively toward
tomorrow's doubleheader, which
begins at l p.m. ,

Trying too hard

by Jim Strickler

Despite their current record, the
Grinnell's men’s tennis team
really isn’t that bad, Last
weekend's defeats dropped the
team's dual meet record to 075. The
scores of those meets add up to a 3
42 match record. The first good tes
of the strength of the Pioneers wil
come this weekend when they
travel to Wartburg College for an
invitational with four other small
colleges,

Last Friday the team traveled
to Coe, but left their top four

- ' players at home. The result was a

Sophomore Bob Meyer waiting
tor the pitch.

‘ 9-0 defeat, but a good experience
‘ for the Grinnell team For most of
. the players it was their first meet
, of the year.

Saturday, the top seven went to
Iowa City and got crushed by the
University of Iowa junior varsity,
9-0. The highlight of the trip was
the team‘s amazement at big time
athletics. Carpeted locker rooms, a
trainer at the meet, and the ins
credible size of the U of I football
players dressing for spring
practice made one realize quickly
that one was not at Grinnell
College.

Coach Peterson said that he was
not particularly satisiied with the
teams play. “We are trying hard,
maybe a bit too hard. We need to
relax more on the court. "

Peterson and the team are
looking forward to the Wartburg
Tournament where they will

return to playing small colleges.
Peterson said, “Our ‘sprlng
training season' is over. So tar,
we’ve just been trying to play well.
Now it is time to start getting the
job done as well.”

Pa: for the course?

by Bob Meyer

Last Friday and Saturday the
Grinnell golf team ventured off
into two of Iowa’s more glamorous
towns: Cedar Falls and Waverly.
UNI and Wartburg College jointly
sponsored a two day tournament
which was played in Cedar Falls on
Friday and in Waverly on Satur-
day. Sixteen teams, most of them
from Iowa, competed in this two
day tournament. Iowa State, one of
the larger schools to compete, won
the tournament handily and
Grinnell, one of the smaller
representatives, finished eleventh,

Grinnell played well in their first
day of competition and was onl
five strokes away Irom the fourt
place team. UNl's lengthy course
and stiff winds proved overly
challenging to all the golfers
competing. Grinnell's average
individual score, 83.5, on UNI’s
par 72 course is prooi that UNl’s
course was tough.

The second day of golf was
played on Wartburg’ 5 par 70 Course
in Waverly. Grinnell, hoping to
play well and finish among the
leaders, disappointed themselves.
No one on the Grinnell team played
up to their full potential and
Grinnell dropped Irom eighth place
to eleventh

The winning score of the tour-
nament was an amazingly low 142.

Harmon shot Grinnell‘s lowest
score with a two -day total of 76777,
[53. Hopkins finished with a 77-77,
154; Phil Gutman shot a double
eighty, 160: and Dave Vanderpool
shot a 83778, lﬁl. In this tournament
only the team’s top four scores are
totalled in the team score. Larry
Callison and Kevin Rackstraw both
shot 180 and therefore were not
included in Grinnell's team score,

This last Wednesday, better
known as the rainy Skip Day, five
Grinnell golfers sacrificed fun for‘
another 36 hole tournament. Rain,
however, shortened the four»
nament to only eighteen holes. The
Grinnellians traveled to Iowa City
iii play In the “Iowa Invitation-
a

The top tour scores from each
team were included in the team
score. The Pioneers top tour
scores were 76 by Hopkins, 80 by
Vanderpool 33 by Gutman, and 39
by Harmon Since the lain ruined
evel'ynne's good spiriB in Iowa
City, the Pioneer golf team left the
golf course before all the scores
had been tallied. Thus, Grinnell's
placing in this tournament is un
beknownst to all

This Saturday the golf squad
again plays in an “unscheduled

 

tournament." Only three teams
will compete: Grinnell. Simpson
and host Iowa State
