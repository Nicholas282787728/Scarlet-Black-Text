continues," his office will receive
approximately 1100 applications by
the end oi the year

Last year the Office of Ad-
missions received ioeo ap-
plications for admission.

Hopkins estimates that next year
there will be “around 400" new
students entering in the fall. He
noted, however, that he would have
to wait until campus room draw is
completed beiore he can get a
better idea of how many spaces

The admissions office has

/.r eived eighteen_applications
.1 in international students and
eighty applications irom blacks
These are more international
applications and more black ap
plications than the college has
received in any oi the past live
years Hopkins attributes the rise
in black applications to “better
recruitment." He also cited the
willingness on the part oi some
black students to involve them-
selves iii the admissions process as
another [actor responsible for the

Applicants may request one of
three notification dates offered by

 

the college: January 1, the
notification date for “Early
Decision" applicants; March 1; or
April 15

(ii the 77 applicants who
requested the January 1 ”early
decision” announcement, 67 were
offered admission, Sixty of these
have paid the stud advance tuition
deposit, thus securing themselves
a place in next year's freshman
class,

of the 475 students who
requested the March 1 notification
date, 383 were offered admission.
130 of these have of these have
paid the $100 tnonrefundable)
deposit and approximately another
100 have been granted extensions
by the college.

Hopkins acknowledged the
relatively small difference bet-
ween the iiumber oi applications
received (522 for “early decision”
and March 1 notification) and the
number oi applicants offered
admission 1450). He stressed,
however, the high quality of the
entire applicant pool which ac»
counts for the low number of ap-
plication denials,

Hopkins noted that oi the 552
applicants offered admission 91
per cent are in the top twoiiiths oi
their high school class and seventy
per cent are in the top iiith. ot the
102 denied admission, ’ Hopkins
noted iiity per cent are also in the
top two fifths of their class,

Hopkins also revealed that the

S,A.T. scores, both verbal and
math, of those student offered
admission averaged between 570

and 590, which is 150 points above 3

the national average. This is a
slightly lower average than that or
last year’s group, but this is in
keeping with a national trend oi
dropping S.A.T scores. The
average composite A.C,T score
for applicants oiiered admission is
25, which is comparable to the
S.A T. range.

Hopkins feels that the overall
character of those students offered
admission in the past two years is
“slightly more conservative and
more career oriented” than in
previous years, “They are more
accepting of social standards," he
said, “and they are a little more
accepting oi advice in academic
and career counseling." Hopkins
says he finds them more willing to
consider “what they are doing
academically and whether it
meshes with what they want later
in life,"

Hopkins estimates that ﬁfty per
cent of those students admitted in

z History department in

David Green

in the past iew months serious
dissension has developed between
the history iacutty and the student
Educational Policy Committee of
that department The problems
that arose have been tem~

s rily resolved. However, the

rieral vagueness oi the college’s
EPC policy could easily lead to a
Si ilar situation in ﬂ’ie future.
«rthe spring or 1976, Ronald
Yang, instructor in history, aria
nounced thathe would be resigning
his position on the faculty at the
end of this academic year, At that
point, the college advertised an
opening ior an East Asian inr
structor More than 100 ap-
plications were submitted.

A sub-committee oi the history
faculty consisting oi Yang, Philip
Kintner, proiessor oi history, and
Gregory Guroff, associate
professor of history, was iormed to
C net the initial phases of the
sea-(ch for a new instructor. The
initial group of 100 applicants was
narrowed to a field of between 15
and 20 possible candidates.

The “search"r‘committee then
mooted interviews with 17
applicants between Christmas and
year in

New Year’s last
Washington DC, at an American
Historical Association convention,
In addition, four telephone in-
terviews were conducted by
Kintner and Gurofi at a later date,

The result of these interviews
was that {our candidates were
iniﬂally invited to visit the cam-

pus, It was at this point that the
history art: became actively
involved with the faculty in the
final selection process, Members
of the EPC interviewed the cane
didates, and took part in colloquia
and iniormal gatherings during
the on-campus visits oi the
prospective instructors.

This arrangement was the result
of a formal agreement drawn up
during the last academic year, and
approved by both the history
faculty and the EPC. The

taculty failed to reach a consensus
concerning a iinal recom-
mendation. Because of this cir-
cumstance, the ultimate decision
was deferred to Department
Chairman Kintner.

Kintner decided that the fifth
candidate should be recommended
by the iaculty, over the
protestations oi Yang and the EPC,
both of whom had favored the
fourth candidate. Two different
letters of recommendation were
presented, one by the faculty and

serve as an advisory body in the
hiring oi new personnel. The EPC,
alter becoming acquainted with
the candidates. recommended
their preferred choice to fill the
vacancy.

This candidate, however, was
not the ultimate choice of the
faculty. After the four candidates
had visited the campus, two
members of the search committee
proposed that a iiith candidate he
invited to visit Grinnell. At this
juncture Yang and the EPC began
to feel that the weight of their
opinions were negligible in the
deliberations of the faculty. .

After lengthy deliberation, the

Council meeting, where Yang also
expressed his views on the matter.
The Executive Council accepted
the faculty’s recommendation.
Kintner emphasizes that the
final recommendation lies with the
members of the history faculty.
“In accord with established
procedure with the EFC this was to
be a departmental decision.”
According to David Jordan,
associate professor of history, “an
extraordinary amount oi attention
is paid to student perceptions” of a
candidate’s teaching ability and
classroom manner. in his opinion
the EPC constitutes a broad
representation of the majors.

sidered with as much weight as
that oi the iaculty “because they
(the EPC members) lack access to
recommendations and grades and
are not proiessionals themselves.”

Guroff draws a distinction
between the hiring oi new per
sonnel and the retention of current
instructors. He believes that
students should have “subr
stantiaily different input on hirings
and retentions,” Because the
recommendation of the EPC was
not taken in this instance “there
should not be a logical conclusion
that students have a minimal ef-
fect on all personnel decisions,"

A radically diiierent viewpoint is
held by the man vacating the

position in question. “I sided with
the EPC in the whole matter, I
think they should have a stronger
voice,” Yang explained, “I am a
student power type lrom the six
ties, i believe people havea right to
decide who is going to teach
them,”

Yang does not believe that the
faculty is necessarily the best
qualified group to judge the
academic qualifications of all
candidates. In his opinion the EPC
should be deeply involved in all
departmental decisions, “Students
have the ultimate power. but they
will not. get it through procedures,"
he said.

The entire process caused the
EPC to question their effectiveness
and influence in their relationship
with the faculty. Barbara Straus,
senior chairperson oi the history
EPC, believes that though the EPC
“decided to come down heavily
behind one candidate in order to
have any clout.” it has become
apparent to her that, “we didn't
have any chance of getting any of
our demands."

Another EPC member, Sally
Snapp believes that ii the
EP’C were allowed more complete
access to information on can-
didates they would be able to
render a more substantial opinion.
She also believes that in the final
Selection process “if the faculty is
split the EPC should be the
deciding factor.”

major on the EPC, disliked what he
