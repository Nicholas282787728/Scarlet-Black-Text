We are fortunate to have two
films for Slavic Weekend that are
not only important in terms oi
Slavic culture, but have in
ternational appeal and importance
as well . '

“Alexander Nevsky” (1933) was
directed by Sergei Eisenstein, one
of film's foremost theoreticians,
Eisenstein is probably best known
for his theory of “montage,” or the
rapid cutting from one image to
another In order to achieve an
overall effect This is best
illustrated in his ”Potemkin”
(1925)

Despite early successes.
Eisenstein was hindered by a
combination oi Soviet policy
changes and ill-timed mishaps,
and left only six completed films
for posterity ”Alexander Nevsky"
was completed on the heels of a
disastrous American venture
which had brought harsh criticism
from officials. But this film firmly
re-established Eisenstein as
Russia's resident iilm genius.

The hero oi “Klexander Nevsky”
is a young Russian who rallies his
countrymen to oppose Teutonic
marauders in the i3th century.
Unabashedly patriotic. the film is a
tribute to the strength of Russian
heritage and character. Two of the
most striking images oi “Nevsky"
are the battle on the ice (filmed
during a July heat wave sub—

stituting melted glass, salt and
chalk for lcei, and the awesome,
armorrclad, Teutonic warriors,
.The photography was supervised
by Edward risse, the Swiss emigre
who became one of the founding
fathers of Russian cinema. Aside
from Eisenstein’s direction.
“Alexander Nevsky” is most
famous for Prokofiev’s brilliant
score, written expressly for this
movie.

The second film for Slavic
Weekend comcs from another
time and another place, it is
“Ashes and Diamonds” £1958),
directed by Poland’s answer to
cinema’s “new wave,” Andrzej
Wajda. Wajda filmed ”Ashes and
Diamonds” during the renaissance
in Polish culture that followed “de
Stalinization” in the middle ’50’s.

The entire story of “Ashes and
Diamonds" unfolds in just 24
hours, soon after the liberation of a
provincial town in 1945, Briefly, it
is the story oi Maciek, a member of
the underground who now tights
communists instead of Nazis,

“Ashes and Diamonds" has the
trappings of ancient tragedy (the
classical unities, a prisoner of fate,
etc) as well as the straight-
forwardness of suspense thriller.
At the same time it is a thoughtful
study of Poland at the dawn of a
new age, at the beginning at a
political process that continues
even to this day. Zhigniew Cyhulski
(Maciek) became the symbol of
Polish youth during this difficult
period of adjustment,

 

Since “Ashes and Diamonds,”
Wajda has continued to make
provocative and imaginative

movies and has taken a place in the
vanguard of European directors.
The fact that he has done so within
the structure of a communist
society only iurther enhances his
reputation.

This weekend's nonr‘culturul'
film involves some of the best»
known names and faces in
American movies Director Frank
Capra, Scenarist Robert Riskin,
and Gary Cooper, the same
combination that clicked in 1936
with ”Mr. Deeds Goes to Town,”
got together again in 1941 to make
“Meet John Doe,” an interesting
and entertaining attempt to ex7
plore the potential tor a iascist
power play in the us.

Long John Willoughby tCooper),
a penniless minorrleague pitcher,
is hired by a newspaper as a tront
for a series oi articles written by
“John Doe" (really reporter
Barbara Stanwyck). What starts
out as ‘a circulation-boosting
gimmick turns into a national
movement as people all over the
country begin forming “John Doe"
clubs, all dedicated to the prin
ciples of honesty and brotherhood
that the articles espouse. The
comical aspects of Cooper’s
predicament turn more serious as
“John Doe" becomes a power to be
reckoned with and evil bigsmoney
interests try to ‘coopt‘ Cooper.

Critic Richard Corliss calls the
last scene in “Meet John Doe" “a
golden kernel oi Caprarcorn," but
despite the sentimentality, the
film’s ambitious theme and
Cooper’s engaging humility made
this movie a popular success. One
interesting question: What are the
implications of CaprarRiskin's
“demagogic populism?”

Experimental

theatre

by itiiiia Miller

As part of my theatrical con»
ccrns and endeavors, I would like
to take this opportunity to com-
municate with the campus come
munity about some “new theatre"
experiments going on at Grinnell
College. For a number of years I
have been working on a theatrical
development that breaks aivay
from classical and traditional
theatre.

This quest has led me to a
theatre that realizes body
language as an important part to
communication 1 have spent time
working with deaf artists as well as
hearing artists on this exploration.
In everyday his most people use
tllcir bodies as well as their mouths
to speak, but how often this
language oi the body is ignored and
words are what are heard How
often the words mean nothing How
oiten the words say one thing and
the body says another,

In conjunction with this interest I
have written several theatre
pieces, some as theatre dance
pieces and one scripted scenario to
be performed tor the campus at
large on March isle and 17. It is a
very simple scriptthat deals with a
meeting between a man and a
woman and the ensuing dialogue
it is very simply a “pick up" scene.
The actors in this vignette, entitled
“The Tryst,” are Julie Meyer and
Rich Houston, This is a work in
progress, with the actors con-
stantly being subjected to rewrites
