Trustees set directions

by Janet Pope

Though the trustees made few

final decisions at their meeting

alast weekend, they expressed
'concern for certain problem areas
and suggested directions for
further study,

Strong support was voiced lor
the development of an affirmative
action policy; the Dober report
was enthusiastically received;
proposals lor expansion of Burling
Library were discussed; a capital
fund raising campaign was
discussed; and it was decided not
to use budget funds to expand the
Science Library.

Dean Mary Eysenbach’s report
about affirmative action at

grinnell College was well received

y the trustees. This weekend, a
trustee committee was formed to
examine the recommendations of
the campus group that is presently

\scussing affirmative action
policies.

Eysenbach has proposed four
areas for the student-faculty
administration committee to
examine. Members began to
discuss recommendations on
allirmative action and tenure,
hiring and promotion, duties of an
affirmative action officer and the
function of an affirmative action
committee at a Tuesday alternoon
meeting,

*Richard P. Dober, of Dober and
ssociates, presented his report to
the full board Saturday afternoon
in ARH 11. At Monday’s faculty
meeting, Turner reported that the
tustees had responded quite

 

iavorably to the report. He said
they had authorized 3&6 to
examine a building or two at a time
and make price estimates of
proposed renovations.

Turner explained that on-
campus discussion would take
place concerning dorm
renovations between now and
June, “The Board ought to be
prepared lo take an initial step in
June in the area of dorm lm~
provemcnts,” he told the laculty,

According to Christopher
McKee, librarian of the college, the
trustees were “sympathetic" to
the need {or expansion or the
library, McKee gave a presen-
tation to the trustees on Saturday
afternoon, also

McKee said that the library will
run out of space in six or seven
years. He explained that there is
room for 260,0001volumes in
Burling. Presently, there are
223,000 volumes on the shelves.
About 7,000 volumes are added
each year. “When you look at what
other schools are doing, you see
that we have to keep doing what
we're doing, and more, to be
competitive,” he said. “So it's
inevitable that we’ll soon run out of
space.”

McKee explained that the
trustees requested an onecai'npus
examination ol the library space
before their June meeting. “They
want us to examine the possibility
for renovation in the present
structure that will give us more
space," he said, The library
committee will be examining such

 

possibilities. according to McKee.

Both_Turner and McKee said
that it is probable that a consultant
will be hired to examine the
present library building and the
possibilities lor expansion.
However, such a decision would
not be made before the June
trustee meeting.

Once again, the trustces talked
about plans for a capital fund-
raising program “We are now
gathering information and
preparing tor a heightened fund
raising program," explained
Turner. '

Funds in the college’s overall
budget will not be used to expand
the Science Library lor at least a
year. the trustees decided this
weekend However, board
members did authorize the ad-
ministration lo look for outside
money to use [or expansion.

The trustees were scheduled to
meet with and talk to students only
a few times during the weekend.
Some of them went to a Rail/son
party ior them Saturday night and
others attended an all-campus get
together in Loose the same night.

Ruth Montgomery, Bob Handler
and Gary Docrnhoeler, SGA
president, vicepresident and
assistant student coordinator,
respectively, made a presentation
to the board Saturday morning.
SGA Cabinet members and several
members of the Residence Hall
improvements Committee met
with the trustee Committee on
Community Liie Sunday morning.

Reflections and celluloid:
Muffie Meyer returns

by Dchhic Weilier

in May oi her senior year here at
Grinnell, Muffie Meyer made a
ejsmn to reject security, money,
ﬁstige, comfort, and a PhD. She
turned down a Ford Foundation
rant to study medieval literature
he University ofrChicago. In»
stead, almost on a whim, she
started applying to film schools,
alter being inspired by the Beatles’
movie A Hard Day's Night. The
gamble paid oil, and last weekend,
ten years later, Muilie Mcyer
returned to Grinnell as a suce
cessiul lilmmaker. She came to
discuss her acclaimed
documentary, Grey Gardens, but
also lound time to reilect upon
Grinnell then and now, her life
alter leaving Grinnell, and the
c~ r oi iilmmaking.
qufie graduated in 1967, as
Grinnell was beginning to emerge
as a leader in campus activism,
However, most of the students at
that time held moderate views and
ﬁe relatively apolitical. “There
was still a big conservative laction
on campus,” she said, She was one
at the few true hard—core radicals
on campus, helping to found
Grinnell‘s SDS (StudenB tor a
Democratic Society) chapter, She
described radicals and non-
radicals alike as “incredibly
politically naive . , . kids really
didn’t have any awareness” about
the war in Viet Nam.

 

Grinnell’s radicals were busy,
however. “We had the first
demonstration in history against
the CIA," she said. The SDS
organized a walk to Des Moines for
peace (“not more than ten”
Students participated), leafleted on
behalf of the poorer sections of Des
Moines, and chartered buses to
Washington to participate in
demonstrations. One of her few
experiences with film in Grinnell
involved making a “nudie”
commercial lor the popcorn the
radical group sold at campus
movies, The commercial was
shown in ARH.

Grinnell in 1967 was not that
much different from Grinnell in
1977, ”The rules have changed, but
the people haven’t,” she
remarked. The men lived on North
campus and the women lived on
South; women on the laculty were
few and iar betwen, but “strangely
enough, the students have stayed
pretty much the same." She did
mention one particular diilcrence:
when she attended Grinnell, a
higher proportion ol women were
here solely to find husbands, There
was a group at women who “set
their hair,” dressed fashionably,
and otherwise concerned them-
selves with attracting men. “I
despised them." she laughed.

Muffie found the students she
came in contact with last weekend

 

aware and friendly, and more
intelligent and involved than
students on other campuses she
has visited recently. Though she
agreed that it is scary to return to a
place that conjures up so many
memories. she added, “I've had a
great time."

After her spuroletheemoment
decision to go into filmmaking,
llluiiie started applying to film
schools. She indicated on her a -
pllcations that she had alrea y
made a film, and after mailing
them in, quickly set out to borrow
a 16 mm camera to make a fllm
and substantiate her-claim. She
was accepted and attended the film
school of New York University. At
NYU She made at least one film
every wcek.

After grad school, she managed
to get a job working on the movie
\i'ootlstoc . From there she went
on to edit The Groove Tube, The
Lords of Flatbusli, and Six
AmericaiL Families. She has also
worked on Sesame Street and
various industrial films. With
Ellen Hovde. a co-editor and
partner, she has formed a film
company called Middlemarch, and
plans to move into the areas ol
producing and directing.

Grey Gardens, her most recent
film, is ”an example of ‘cinema
verite.’ ” Its dominant theme is
about the nature at dependent

Turner changes plans

At Monday's laculty meeting,
President A. Richard Turner
revealed his plan lor proceeding
with examining the luture of the
college and implementing new
programs, The three parts of his
plan are l) a practical education
inventory or all departments, 2)
continued work and discussion by
alreadyeformed committees, and
3) collection of ideas for discussion
of programs by Luther Erickson
chairman of the faculty, and Ruth
Montgomery, SGA president,

Turner decided not to pursue the
plan he was developing heiore the
trustee meeting, which involved
compiling a list of topics for oil»
lerent groups to discuss, He
developed his new plan Monday
morning

This revised plan, Turner told
the laculty, is a less ambiguous,
concrete rather than philosophical
approach, and will be useful in
estimating the amount of money to
be raised in the iund raismg
campaign,

Turner explained that the
practical education inventory
would require that each depart
ment examine its curriculum for
approximately the next ten years
and decide how much funding it
will need. He recommended that
such projections be discussed at
lull laculty meetings in cone
junction with EPC members

 

Since campus committees are
already set up involved in plan
ning, Turner said at the meeting
that he sees no reason not to use
them.

Turner then mentioned the White
Paper, the document that ex
presses his ideas for the future of
the college, “Not only am i leaving
the white Paper trailing in the
sunset, hut rm running last in the
opposite direction,” he said.

He told the faculty that the ln-
ventory and committee work
would be sufficient for planning
unless anyone on campus has ideas
about topics lor discussion or new
programs in that case, Tumer
laid the laculty , people should take
their ideas to Erickson or Monte
gomery. “The ball in a certain
sense is in your court.” Turner
said,

Turner did not elaborate on what
he expected Erickson and Mont-
gomery to do with ideas that are
presented to them When asked
about the process Tuesday more
ning, he replied, “I don't know,
We'll see what we get.” He Said he
expected Erickson and Monte
gomery to be working with Dean
Waldo Walker.

Turner’s plan has received
mixed reactions. Some agree with
Turner that it is a more practical
approach. while otllers consider it
as vague as his prevmus plan
