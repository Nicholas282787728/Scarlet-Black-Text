Wednesday afternoon, the
Executive Council approved
guidelines for the involvement of
Student Educational Policy
Committees (EPCS) in faculty
hiring procedures. The guidelines
are now college policy and will be
distributed to faculty members.

Dean Waldo Walker, Executive
Council member. said that he
developed the guidelines from
suggestions given to him by
Executive Council members. He
s°id that the need for guidelina
Dame apparent when he was
working on a statement delineating
the responsibilities of department
chairmen, Another reason he cited
' thatmembers of several EPCs
to come to him complaining that
their EPCS never met.

The guidelines adopted by the
Counc' include two specific
restrictions on EPC activity in the
faculty hiring process. The
guidelines state that students are
not allowed to see Candidates‘
transcripts or letters of recom-
mendation. It specifies that
students will not be members of the
formal hiring team that interviews
candidates at professional con-
' . ces. However, the guidelines
say that students can meet in»
formally with candidates that
faculty members are planning to
in 'te to campus at these con
iciences. The college will not pay
for student expenses incurred at
such meetings.

Other guidelines established
specify that EPC members be
involved in defining positions that
need to be ﬁlled. that they be in-
formed on the final description by
the department chairman, and that
they be informed about what
candidates the department is
bringing to campus to interview.

members or administrators being
present. EPC members shall also
be invited to a colloquium given by
the candidate. The EPC will then
give department members a
written report of their preferenr
ces. The guidelines say that EPC
members are not required to rank
order candidates. Walker said,
however, that the Council could not
forbid EPCs to rank candidates.

The guidelines go on to state that
the department may wish to meet
with the EPC to discuss the EPC
position, that the faculty will
submit a recommendation to the
Executive Council which will in-
clude the recommendation of the
EPC and that the department
chairman will notify the EPC 0f
the Executive Council decision as
quickly as possible.

Last week the Executive Council
decided that students should not be
part of the formal hiring team at
professional conferences. “The
Council's impression," explained
Walker, “is that it (student in
volvement) deprofessionalizes the
formal interview session." He
cited the short duration of in
terviews and the fact that “stu-
dents don’t have the expertise
except to evaluate personality," in
such a situation as other reasons

for the decision.

Jack Worley, chairman of the
philosophy department, explained
that he has taken students to hiring
conferences three different times.
He said that he thinks studenB can
evaluate the teaching ability of
candidates just as well or maybe
better than he can He also said
that the college can save money by
having studenB reject candidates
at conferences rather than after
they have been brought to campus.

Worley said that the philosophy
department will no longer include
students as part of formal in-
terviewing teams, but will have
them meet informally with can
didates at conferences,

One group ofstudents that heard
about last week‘s Executive
Council ruling produced a petition
asking that the ruling be rescinded
and that EPC-faculty relationships
be left up to individual depart
ments.

By Tuesday they had collected
over 600 signatures. They
prsented the petition to Walker
and asked that he present it to the
Executive Council. Wednesday
night, Walker Said that he had not
presented it that afternoon, but
that he would give it to the Council
Thursday.

Affirmative action
plan presented

by Jan ct Pope

Wednesday, two documents were
circulated to the faculty The Ad
hoc Affirmative Action Advisory
Committee sent members An
Affirmative Action Program for
Grinnell College and Dean Mary
Eysenbach provided them with a
report entitled “The Status of
Women and Minority Employees
at Grinnell College.”

The program specifies
guidelines for the hiring, retention
and promotion of faculty and staff
and the tenure of faculty It also
delineates the responsibilities and
rights of the Affirmative Action
Officer and the Affirmative Action
Advisory Committee.

The report relates a short history
of the numbers of women and
minority faculty members at
Grinnell, their present numbers as
compared with the respective
applicant pools. and a projection of
their numbers at Grinnell in ten
years. ltalso discusses the salaries
of women and minority faculty and
professional staff members,

Eysenbach said there are no
formal channels ofapproval for the
proposal, but that she is asking
that the program be adopted by the
president and endorsed by the
faculty.

The Adrhoc Committee has been
meeting since last semester to
discuss, develop and revise a
working document for an af-
firmative action program at the
college. According to the members
of the committee, Eysenbach was
largely responsible for writing the
document. Committee members
praised her highly for her time and
effort as well as for the final
product 7

Eysenbach is pleased with the
proposal. “1 think itisa good sound
program which the college should
have no difficulty living with," she
commented. “I think it will serve
to keep a high degree of awareness
in all hiring decisions, and that's
what we‘re after."

 

The report states that the
minimum goal of the college
should he that women and
minorities on the faculty “be not
less than the per cent of such
persons among those with Ph D ’s
or equivalent final degrees." This
policy would require that not less
than 20 per cent of the faculty be
female and three per cent
minority.

The report stresses that the
above goals are minimum ones. it
states, “The college should aspire
to do better. that is, to be a model
not of the world as it is, but of a
world with less race-
discriminatlon and less sex-
discrimination than in con
temporary American society,
More challenging goals for the next
five years are 25 per cent female
and five per cent minority group
members on the faculty." Though
the program does not guarantee
that these goals will be reached. it
establishes a standard by which
the community can judge af-
firmative action efforts

Among his other duties, vice
Provost William Barrett will
assume those of Affirmative Ace
tion Officer when he arrives in
July. The officer is to keep in
formed about all affirmative ac
tion matters. He is to be informed
of all employment openings and is
to review all hiring decisions, The
officer is to report any violations of
the law or college policy to the
Affirmative Action Advisory
Committee and to make periodic
reports to the committee.

Barrett will be an exnofficio
member of the Affirmative Action
Advisory Committee. Voting
members of the advisory come
mittee will include a chairman,
elected by and from the faculty,
two faculty members also elected
by the faculty, one staff member
and one student member and one
student alternate.

College meeting growing expenses

Faculty. administrative a
BEG salaries
577587.

by Tom Areriberg
and
BobMitchell

A definite increase in salaries
and an expected sizeable increase
in utility expenditures are two
important items in the 197778
Grinnell College budget, currently
being developed by Dean Waldo
Walker.

The Trustees have given Walker
a $3,052,000 budget ceiling under
which to meet expenses.

Faculty. administration and
Bith salaries for next year
have already been determined.
They average a 7.5 per cent in-
crease over salaries in 1976777.
This increase runs 1.2 per cent
ahead of the increase in total
budgetary expenditures between
this year's budget and next year’s.
Salary costs are the single largnst
portion of the college’s operating
costs, accounting for 57 to 58 per
cent of a typical ymr's budget.

These increases in salary have

helped to keep Grinnell faculty
members among the best paid in
me nation for schools of com-
parable size, Full professors
make, on the average, $23,017
annually, associate professors
average $16,600, assistant
professors'average $13,630, and
instructors earn around $13,088.
According to Walker, salaries here
are generally running well above
the national level.

“Our instructors and assistant
professors are paid more highly
than the average across the
country. The associate professors
are much better than average, but
not at the Harvard level The full
professors are better than average
but less than the Harvard level as
well,” he said,

In fiscal year 197546, the faculty
received the largat portion of the
total salary outlay, getting 58 per
cent. Administrative and non-
academic support personnel, a
category which includes such

position as librarians. resident
advisers and secretaries, received
24 per cent of the salary ex»
penditures. B o G employees got 18
per cent of the salary outlay These
figures, according to Walker, are
roughly the same for any year.
Another area in which com are
rapidly growing is utility expenses.
This year, according to Walker,
utilities were budgeted at $327,000,
which is approximately four per
cent of the 1976-77 budget. He said,
however, that real expenditures in
this area may run as high as 8 per
cent of total expenditures this

:year, This would mean an ap3

proximately 30 per cent increase
over utility costs in 197471975.
Food service costs and financial
aid are the other major budgetary
items. Ina typical year, 10 to 11 per
cent of the budget goes for
financial aid, not including student
loans or salaries. Ten to 10.5 per
