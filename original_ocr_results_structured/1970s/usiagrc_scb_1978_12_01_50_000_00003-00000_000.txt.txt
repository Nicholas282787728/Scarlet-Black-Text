The Leggett decade: a time of turmoil

by Paul Reich

1965 marked the beginning ot a
decade of turbulence and trans»
formation for the nation alld for the
Grinnell College community. A
financial crunch, posteCambodian
disenchantment and general
campus unrest set the scene for
significant changes in student life
and academics, according to Glenn
Leggetl. president of the college
from 1965-1975. Ii. was during this
restless period that events which
are now Grinncll legends, such as
the infamous Playboy nude-in,
occurred,

in May oi 197s Le‘ggett p bli hed
a book about his admin tr‘ ion
entitled Years of Turmoil, Years
oi Change: Selected Papc or a
College President. I 5.
Among the papers are speeches,
ietters and reports made over
those ten years. As Leggett says in
the Introduction, the book deals
with “all those various matters,
educational and otherwise, that
occupied the attention of laculty,
students, and college ad»

ministrators in the late sixties and
early seventies,” During Leggett's
administration the college unr
derivcnt changes unlike any in 115
previous history

Leggett was torced to mold these
diverse groups into a semisolid
whole for the immediate and future
welfare of the College community.

There was a radical curricululn
change which resulted in the
dropping ot requirements. While
appearing skeptical about the
changes the new curriculum policy
entailed, he embraced the notion of
change: “It is better for the in
Stitutibn that the board (the
trustees) go along with an oc-
casional controversial experiment
than prohibit it or withdraw the
credit that the academic
authorlties have provided.”

Pool champions crowned

Grinnell‘s tinest pool sharks came to play. When the pool chalk dust

The decade also saw radical
changes in dorm life: a movement
trom a sexually segregated tn a
sexually integrated campus. in
this matter, chgctt was laced
with serious opposition from all
sides Tile students were fighting
for an “open-room. open-hour"
policy while the parents and
alumni were fighting against this
new morality,

IN SEPTEMBER OF 1967
Leggett, in a speech to students,
spoke out against an “open-room,
open-hour" policy, By 1971
however. the college was in
tcgrated Rather than obstinately
clinging to the past, chgctt, over
time, was able to appease all oi the
groups concerned.

In February 1969. the legendary
“disrobing” Incident occurred
when a representative trom
playboy appeared on campus to
speak. During his discussion six
women and [our men stood up,
disrobed. sat down and began to
Sing “You've Got to Walk That
Lonesome Valley.” They Cirr
culated a petition which objected to
Playboy's dehumanizing and
degrading treatment of men,
women and sexual activity. The
news media obtained a story and
pictures ot the cvent and Grinnell
College became national news
overnight,

L aGGETT. PUT IN it difficult
position, was forced to mollify
parents and alumni Without
alienating the students lle
acknowledged the ongoing
revolutlon in Amerlcan education
but felt that this particular incident
was not a constructive part of it,
but rather exhibitionistic and
sensational,

“From a sale distance oi six
years and another Job," he
describes the Playboy nuderin:
”Picture a darkish, probably
smokeriilled student lounge, with ii
halH n oi adolescent ilesh unr
dressing ltself to the mourntul
guitar tones of ‘Down 'l‘hat
lonesome Knad,‘ during which
time a small number of non»
participants sobcrly passed out

Math lab solves your problems

by Laura llroilsliy

A new math lab opened in early
November to provide assistance to
students in all areas ot
mathematics and any sciences
involving mathematical
calculation

The lab began as the ”brain
child" ot math protessor Gene
l-lcrman who saw the need tor a
math assistance . eruice that would
tunction in a way similar to
Griiinell's writing and reading
labs

Mark Jones, director or the lab.
stresses that the center 15 now in its
tormative stages and is very
ttexible. He explains that the
tunctions or the lab will depend on
the needs oistudents. and that he is
willing to respond to student needs
and suggestions. Jones says that
his program is ‘ftailor made" to lit

the individual mathematical needs
oi Grinnell students.

This semester. most of the lab
visitors have been students from
math classes who need extra
assistance in course work, but next
semester. Jones hopes to reach
more students in any classes iihere
math is used

The . . ance provided to these
students includes review ot the
mathematical notions and
calculations they are likely to
encounter in their course work
The student begins with a question
on specilic problems This
provides a point ot departure tor
moi general discussion and
clariﬁcation oi relevant concepts.

Jones sometimes gives his
“tulees” a taste of the
mathematical perspectives ot such
philosophers as Bertrand Russell

them with greater success "

Arnold Adelberg, chairman ot
the mathematics department.
says. “You don‘t have to be in any

and expresses his hope that the lab
might encourage those students
hesttant to lake math courses to
gain more conlidence in their

Both Adelberg and Jones express
their optimism for the gradual
