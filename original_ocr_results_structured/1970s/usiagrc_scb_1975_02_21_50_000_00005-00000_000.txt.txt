rLom for SGA

To the editor:

Ever since that iirst day at
Grinnell when l walked into my
assigned room in Norris and met
John Lom I knew this place was not
for me. John loves it here though,
and has shown great interest in the
Grinnell student community (ask
any freshman chick). He has been
Student Advisor and Hall Coor-
dinator for Norris Hall, and has
been on the Judicial Council for
two years now. His activities have
been well rounded, as he has

' participated on varsity tennis and
soccer teams, and will he soccer
captain next year.

I ieel that John is well»prepared
to [ill the post of SGA president. He
is considerate and as eager to help
people with individual problems as
he is to organize and administer
group activities. His greatest
asset, I believe, is his openness and
accessibility to all types of people.

The combined qualities of
proficient administrative work and
desire to see all factions of our
community represented make
John a unique and wellvqualified
candidate. l strongly urge you to
consider the advantages these
qualifications offer when you
decide what type oi student
government we will have in the
future.

The chiet result ot Wednesday
nights J ' tBoard eting was a

unanimous decision to amend the .
‘VSGA Constitution so as to provide

ior a single vice-president, with no
restrictions as to the sex of that
individual. Previously, two vicar
presidential postions were iilled,
with one person serving on the All-
Campus EPC and involved in
academic concerns, and the other
dealing with social matters on
campus. However, since the Alla
Campus EPC has been abolished,
SGA felt that the duties of the vice-
president could be handled easily
and efficiently by a single in-
dividual. The campus referendum
on this issue will be held on Feb. 26,
the same day as the SGA
presidential election.

on the subject oi the presidential
election, Dave Berkley attended
the meeting to present his plan to
improve the method oi balloting.
Berkley objected to the voting
system used in the past, in which
ballots were placed in students'
mailboxes and seemed ultimately
to end up strewn over the iloor ot
the Post Office. To avoid the
possibility of ballotrbox stuffing,
Berkley said that two persons will
supervise this year’s voting, one to
hand out ballots and check off
numbers as students present their
I.D.’s and the other ot Collect the
marked ballots.

Berkley also proposed that no
flyers or posters lndorsing par-
ticular candidates be allowed in
the voting area on the day of the
election. Warren Smith pointed out
the difficulty of enforcing this
policy strictly, and moved that
SGA vote to prevent Berkley trom
attempting to remove campaign
literature from the post office on
the day of the voting. The motion
passed, 7764. Berkley then stated
that he would try to arrange to
have the polling place changed
from me Post Office to North
Lounge. No further discussion was
held on the issue.

- in other business, SGA members
approved the appointments oi
Betsy Spencer and John Goldfarb
to the newly formed Residence

John Hansen announced that the
long-lost Rally Wagon is now back
in action.

Through the eilorts of the
Student Government Association,
the fourteen-passenger Rally
Wagon will be available for student
activities.

Use oi the wagon will not begin
until the middle of next week, since
a clause in the insurance policy,
which would properly cover the
auto, has not yet been added. Tom
Latimer, recreation director,
explained that although Grinnell
will be charged a substantial inn
surance premium, the college is
“willing to do it,”

The student driver, who must be
21 years old, is required to sign a
contract easing the college from
responsi ty tor the vehicle and
its occupants. This primarily to
protect the college irom actions
resulting from drivers’
irresponsibility,

The vehicle is limited to travel in
the state due to insurance. The
driver will be charged fifteen cents
a mile plus gas, Students may
make reservations through Kath
McCluckey, a physical education
lecturer. The Student Recreation
Committee has priority at all
times.

Latlmer hopes the campus
community appreciates use oi the
wagon “because it's a $6,000
vehicle and $6,000 doesn't come
easy."

Student use of the Rally Wagon

was halted two years ago due to‘

student abuse.

Mr, Miller’s columns on
academic trouble amused me. (I
find humor in the strangest
places) What bothered me most
was that Mr. Miller, with his
fixation on Grape Nut ﬂakes and
Organic Chemistry tomes, ignores
the seriousness of that which he
lampoons. Academic pressure is
an integral part of campus
existence (as opposed to life) and
as such it must be dealt with. When
we combine academic pressure
with another part of the Grinnell
existence, boredom, we find that
the sum oi the parts is a real hole
In the past tew weeks we have had
various attempts at alleviating our
problem, but stink bombs, waltz
nights and gay census methods
have proved only momentary
solutions. I have, after some
cogitation, come up with a any
swer. My thesis is simply thi we
need a new form ot entertainment,
something dramatic, aesthetically
pleasurable, economically ieasible
and which will take up little time in
rehearsal, Two alternatives have
come to mind, and as an All-
Campus Orgy would have small
attendance, l suggest an oer
casional student public selfa

and noble art the cultivation of

vantages are myriad, but we shall
attempt to enumerate them in any
case, It will make our rooming
system more elastic, ease the
student-faculty ratio (and it cer
tain tenured iaculty members
were to catch on to the lad it would
be helpful), enrich us culturally
(hara-kiri), give people a iorum
ior expressing with impunity their
innermost fantasies, improve the
city ambulance service, and rid the
campus of vermin.

The disadvantages are
somewhat dubious. It would not
help one’s GPA, is distracting ii
done in any class other than
Drawing 134, and quite possibly
provide Saga a new type oi
mystery meat. But these disad-
vantages are iew ii you consider
what is to be gained. What is more
heartwarming than a salt-
i molation, is sharper than harar
ki , has more suspense than a
hanging? Further, as inducement,
in View of Dr. Turner’s notion of
academic punting, we could quite
possibly get academic credit ior so
worthy a venture. So next time you
contemplate the immortal act,
don’t hide in the closet, share it
with a friend. Prove to the world
there is something you can do

”S traigh t” } talk
about gay day

In proclalming last Friday as
“Gay Day," the Gay Community
had several goals in mind. First, it
was planned as a day or
celebration tor gay people on this
campus, at time ior us to ieel iree,
proud, and strong We also hoped
to make people more conscious
than ever of the presence of gays
on this campus, as well as to in-
crease the awareness of some of
the difficulties which gay people so
oiten confront. Finally, we hoped
to make a charming mockery oi
the process by which people are
labeled and stereotyped on the
basis of the most insignificant
characteristics.

Asking gays to wear blue jeans in
order to determine the precise
number of gays on campus is an
idea which originated at Rutgers
University last April and has since
been implemented at a number of
colleges and universities, Last
semester, while planning a similar
event for Grinnell, we chose
Valentine's Day as a day most
appropriate to displaying our own
humor and pride.

So we fabricated this ridiculous
social convention of blue jeans
signifying gayness, a convention
which, ior whatever reasons, each
individual could choose to abide by
or ignore. We were not dictating.
Had we asked that all leftrhanded
students wear jeans, who would
have given a damn. But since
gayness was the criteron. people
apparently became alarmed (“ All
l have are jeans!" ”They have
no right to tell me what 1 can
wear!”) Thus, the discomfort or
anger which some people may
have experienced in reaching that
decision was by no means a result
oi any antagonism on our part, but
rather tlle result of a conﬂict of
their own attitudes toward gay
identification. And if just a few

students found themselves won-
dering to what degree it mattered
whether or not they wore Jeans on
Gay Day, then the day may be
considered a success. Fur
thermore, if those straights who
wore jeans experienced even some
small pangs oi uncertainty and
doubt, our point will have been
madeifor in that one moment,
perhaps those individuals learned
a little bit about the anxiety and
fear of exposure with which many
gays have had to deal.

And all of this concern and
mailbox-stuffing was for no reason
other than the obviously tonguerinr
cheek equating or wearing jeans
with being gay. Think how much
m re serious it is ior the gay in
di idual in real life who, in ex
posing his or her gayness, often
risks iamily. iriends, and
livelihood. When did being straight
ever have such proiound con-
sequences?

As ior our portraying the poll as
an attempt to determine Grinnell‘s
gay population, we were, oi course,
not serious. Our basic intentions.
however, were quite serious in-
deed, We know that not everyone
experienced the feelings we
described, but we sincerely hope
that at least some have, and that
the more perceptive individuals
might have become a bit more
sensitive to their own attitudes
toward gayness, and the
relationship of those attitudes to
our concerns at Grinnell and
beyond.

in love and gay pride

College Gay Community

P.S.: The results of the poll in
dicate that 55 per cent of the

college community is gay!
