Lenten meals

The Church Women United of Grinnell and the Grinnell
College Christian Fellowship are sponsoring a series of
“sacrificial" meals throughout Lent. The purpose of these
meals is to relate the historical significance of Lent to
current problems facing the world today such as the world
food crisis.

Each meal will consist of a marginal quantity of food and
some water; an opportunity to give money donations, the
proceeds going to CROP (the world hunger appeal of Church
World Service); and a brief presentation or film concerning
the present world food crisis.

The first sacrificial meal is this Wednesday, Feb. 12, from
6:00 to 7 :00 in Gardner Lounge. It is hoped that someone from
the food conference will give a presentation on some aspect
of the food problem. Subsequent meals will take place in
churches throughout the community on each following
Wednesday (program and place will be announced),

These meals are meant to be a sharing and learning ex
perience for the Grinnell community, not just the college. All
are welcome to come and participate.

Faculty,
goals

planned

President A. Richard Turner
opened the first faculty meeting of
the semester by outlining a broad
perspective of goals and obstacles
to be met by the college. Besides
reearticulating his statements
from last week's S&B interview,
Turner stressed a sense of change
concerning the college‘s future. He
pointed out that the college has to
evaluate and assess its present
priorities such as the library.
curriculum, residence halls, and
finances. He noted that the college
is proceeding on the assumption
that it is on a fund raising came
paign.

Finances

Turner’s concern over the
college’s financial status was
reflected in statements such as:
“We’ve got to move from defensive
financing to offensive financing”
and “to think on terms of capital
development and endowment
development."

One “concrete" proposal sub
mitted by Turner and faculty
chairman Arnold Adelberg con-
cerned lunch. Turner remarked
that it would be a good idea for the
faculty to get together and just
chat. I-le spelled out his plan for
lunch today at Grinnell House. Cost
to the faculty would be a mere $1.00
with a 45 cent subsidy from the
president for the Saga-produced
meal,

The faculty then discussed
means by which the trustees and
faculty could meet in an orderly
fashion. Robert Grey voiced his
concern for some way in which the
faculty's feelings could be aired to
the entire body of trustees

Dean Waldo Walker then
discussed the college’s present
application and admission status.
He pointed out that present ap-
plications are down about a per
cent from last year and that
prospective students are deciding
later in the year to choose schools.
He asked the faculty to continue its
involvement in soliciting
prospective students as it did last
year. While noting that the college
is searching for as many students
as possible, Walker maintained
that the school will not lower its
admission standards

Attrition

Dean of Student Affairs James
Tederman then presented the
faculty with “some good news and
some bad news". The good news
was that only 13 students had With-
drawn or transferred from the
college for the present year. The
bad news was that the school
dismissed 15 students. Tederman
added that the dismissal figure is
tentative due to student appeals.
An adjusted figure could possibly
be as low as If or 15. Among other
facts and figures presented,
Tederman computed a return rate
of 60 percent for students taking
personal leaves.

Scarlet and Black. February 1, '1975—p. 2

The final piece of business was
introduced by the ViceePresident
for Institutional Development,
James Avison, who suggested
some nebulous plans for the up
coming presidential coronation
ceremony. Included in the
blueprint for the April 12th event,
Avison recommended that April ll
be made into some sort of field day
for students, He suggested that
classes be suspended for both
Friday and Saturday, with such
planned activities as games, picnic
lunch, encounter sessions, with
faculty members, and a fair for
Friday. President Turner asked
for comments and other feedback.
A motion was then made to table
Avison’s proposal until more
definite plans were drawn up. The
motion to table was passed with a
flurry of legislative action, and the
meeting was adjourned after the
new faculty members were in-
troduced.

And to the relief of this reporter
who would rather have been
watching Star Trek, Dr, Turner
requested that the faculty meet
just once a month, calling a second
meeting only when necessary.

to play from 10:00 PM. until 2:00
A.M.

Boone, is arranging the party's
specifics.

There is no cost to enter the
affair, but a Grinnell LDI card or a
guest pass. available from any
R,A., will be required for ad-
mission. Stinkbombs will not be
