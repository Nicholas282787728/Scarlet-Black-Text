Last weekend, the Pioneer men’s
basketball team dropped its iirst
two games of the season, 118 86 to
Upper Ioua University and 7 70 to
Lake Forest in Friday evening's
game. a hustling Pioneer team ran
into an Upper low-an team that
dominated offensive and defensive
rebounding The Peacocks also
showed great outside shooting and
an ability to dominate the fast-
paced game new coach Art
Peterson and the Pioneers like to
play.

The iastpaced style makes
mistakes to 'cvidenl. As Ioiig as
team spii and ooniidenee are
good, Peterson thinks these
mistakes will be corrected.
Peterson feels that basketball at
Grinnell will survive only with the
support oi the players and those
that watch the games The
basketball program currently

being used by the Pioneer team

takes advantage oi the motivation ,

of the athletes, Peterson thinks
the role of coach is to be a leader
rather tiian a dictator

As far :is iiinning goes, Peterson
expects good things irom his new
team Peterson attributes the
Friday loss to the iact that Upper
lowa, besides being a good team,
started practice two weeks earlier
than the Pioneers.

The Pioneers lost on Saturday to
a Lake Forest team that beat
Cornell at Mt. Vernon on Friday,
Corliell was picked by the coaches
oi the conierence to win the league
this season The Pioneers often had
the lead in the game and held close
until the later stages of the contest.

The crowds at both games
seemed to enjoy the action and to
appreciate the ciiort of the
Pioneers. It looks like a season of
good ion and excitement

On Nov. 30, the Grinnell women‘g
basketball team played its first
game at the season, against Upper
Iowa University. The Pioneers
lost, 53740, as their opponent's
experience, aggressiveness and
strength resulted in a scoring
surge in the early part at the
second half from which Grinnell
could not recover.

The starting Pioneer lineup was
composed oi freshmen Kim
Krutilla, Stephanie Nelson. Renae
Reese and Ann Chasson and
Junior Chris Stidley. The lack of"
experience and iamiliaritv with
each other was evident, Never
theless. an outstanding defensive
effort in the ﬁrst half resulted in
only a 20716 halitime lead ior Upper ‘
Iowa. However, both Nelson and
Reese got in foul trouble, thus
depriving the Pioneers oi their
rebounding strength.

The second half opened with the
substitutions oi Karen Meyer and
Fran Partridge ior Reese and
Nelson. and two quick baskets by
Krutilla But Upper Iowa began to
penetrate Grinitell's defense with
an eiiective fast break, good
passing and domination oi the
boards, as the Peacocks scored
tu'cntyrthree of the next twenty»
nine points.

The game was the year’s only!
contest with a varsity team. The
remaining games, the first at
which is Dec. 7 vs. Central in the
North Gym of the PRC ar
against Junior varstty teams, With‘
a more Consistent fast break, more
movement offensively, and better
Shooting from the foul line,
Grinnell can add to its assets. The
speed of Krutilla and Stidley, the
strength and rebounding of Nelson
and Reese, and a strong defense
are already plusses,
