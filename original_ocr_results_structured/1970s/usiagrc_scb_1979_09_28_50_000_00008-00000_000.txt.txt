'NERGY: A PROBLE

by Andrew 3Chu/tz

We are in the midst or an era oi scarcity. Last sprr
ing the college began to take steps to conserve
energy for heating, lighting, cooling and other uses.
Discussions were begun on short— and long term
methods of meeting the college‘s energy needs, and a
student-administration-faculty committee, the
Energy Policy Advisory Committee (EPAC), was
organized by Vice provost Ken Browning.

These efforts are continuing this fall, President
George Drake has issued a memo encouraging
energy conservation, and Browning has begun a
small publicity campaign tor conservation using
bright green “Save Energy" stickers on light swit»
ches, He said that savings can be gained [or any
lighu that are turned off when not being used.

“It's part of an effort to raise awareness," Broww
ing explained. “We're trying to encourage people to
save energy where they can."

Browning. who chairs EPAC, is planning a meeting
of the committee soon. On the agenda will be a
discussion of more specific ways to involve students
in energy conservation.

“We need to discuss this." Browning said. “When
students ask: ‘What can I do to help?’ we would like

Cohéidering solar, coal alternatives

to have specific suggestions for them.”

The dorm renovation program_is the college's big-
gest ongoing eiiort to conserve energy. To date.
James, Main, and Clark have been completely
renovated and all dorms have been outfitted with
enel'gyrefticient double windows.

Langan Hall is now being renovated and will pro-
bably be ready tor occupancy beiore the end or next
spring. According to Dean oi Student Atlairs Jim
Tederman, Smith Hall's renovation (not yet started)
should also be completed by that time,

The new energy-effluent “skin” on Norris Hall is
complete, but the fourth floor addition will not be
ready for occupancy until next iall, Browning said.
HE added that all the dorms, and Norris in pairs
ticular, are being monitored [or their energy use.

Earlier this semester, Drake held discussions with
theiaculty on the possibility or making calendar
changes in order to save a week of heating fuel dur»
ing the cold lowa winter. The idea was to add a
week to winter break, thus starting the second
semester later and ending it later, during warmer
spring weather,

Although changes were ruled out tor this year,
future changes are still under consideration, One

Residential customers are
classified as the latter. while
the college is on interruptible

in favor of residential

customers,

In the longer run, Halden
acknowledged that gas and
oil supplies could be ex
hausted within ten to thirty
years. He explained that ['10
