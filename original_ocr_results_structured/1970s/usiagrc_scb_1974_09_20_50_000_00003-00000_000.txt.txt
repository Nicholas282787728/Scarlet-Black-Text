To the editor:

Last week’s article entitled
“Latin American House Seeks

mistaken impression that Latin

Although some members or our
house did participate in these
activities, they were not a iunction
of Latin American House, Rather,
they were sponsored by the

Posters explaining that various
men and women are now ready to
act as sexuality counselors have
been placed around the campus.
These people are available to talk
about such things as birth control,
pregnancy, homosexuality,
masturbation and sexual and non-
sexual relationships. They may be
used as a direct counseling service
or as a referral service to doctors,
clinics, lrce clinics or literature

“We tried to get a whole gamut
of people to act as counselors,”
explained Dianne Ruytielaere,
assistant dean of student affairs
”Several members of the gay
community are involved."

posters will be actually couselmg,

Iowa in focus

by John M. \' 'lic II
NeIIsDirt-clo Kl)l(‘-FM

The little city of Grinnell will
have a big city leature soon—a one
way street system downtown.

Beginning Oct. 1, a 4- block aiea
will become a traffic square Cars
will flow from 5th to 4th on Main,
from Main to Broad on Jth, from
4th to 5th on Broad and from Broad
in Main on 5th.

City manager Ted Clausen ex-
plained that the new system will
allow downtown visitors easier
parking, and will speed the trarric
How.

He added his hope that it will
also cut down on the number of
minor but costly Collisions in the
area, which occur when people
backing out of parking slots {all to
see oncoming cars.

There are few other Iowa cities
as small as Grinnell which have
such a system, Clausen said most
towns have a one way street
somewhere in town, but Grinnell
appears to have opted for the
organized approach.

Besides the street system,
another serious matter has oc-
cupied much ol the council's time
the past two meetingsvsmoking in
the council chambers.

It all started Sept. 3 with a
simple motion by a member of the
council designed to stop the city
fathers lrom conducting their
business in a smoke filled room,

But, the council iorgot who the
smoking ban would eitect. Chiei at
Police Bill Peters was one (tip
fender. The city attorney was
another. So are two of the three
reporters who regularly cover
council sessions.

But, Ilndaunted by the problems,
city oliicials had |hrec large no
smoking signs erected in time tor
Monday's meeting. One, neatly
hand painted on brown paper,
covered almost the entire west
wall of the Council chamber,

A Cedar Falls viomaii. who had

Starrinngartin Blasam;

Richard Beniamin;

read of the smoking ban in her
local newspaper, wrotc the council
members to commend them lor
their courageous action

Spectators and participants at
the meeting retrained irom
smoking But Pcters couldn't resist
asking ii there was any money in
the city budget tor a spittoon tor
the chambers.

By general consensus, his
inquiry was tablediunoiticially.

BITS AND Piecesenlcmbers
of the city council in Centerville
are angry at the mayor for firing
the city’s police chier and naming
another man acting chiel.

So they cut the acting Chief's
salary irom ratio to $100 per month.
And the acting chief agreed to stay
on,

That's called going right to the
heart of the problem.

+++

in the good old days or politics,
reporters had a fun game to play,
Every year, they'd try to iigure out
who was the power behind the
throne of each candidate by
looking tor hidden ﬁnancing.

Now, candidates are falling all
over themselves to disclose more
information about their finances
than their opponents.

Which leaves only one challenge
tor the reporters: finding a large
enough supply or eye drops to wade
through all those pages and pages
of teeny print.

+++

A "prowler there now call can
mean almost anything for the
police oilicer on patrol.

Recently, Des Moines oriicers
received such a call from a woman
whose baked goods had been
consistently disappearing lrom her
kitchen.

Officers caught the thief red
handed, with his hand literally in
the cookie jar

But they aren't jailing the
culprit. He was only seven years
old, and the estimated loss (or
gain. it you're looking at stomachs
and not cookie jars) was only $1 oil.

The youth and his parents Vlll
appear beiore juvenile authorities
later In the month.
