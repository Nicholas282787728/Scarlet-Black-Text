Titillating tongues with vivacious vino

by ion Herrel
During the Grinn‘ellrianondon pro-
gram last tall, Professor San-
dy Moffett introduced a non-Credit
seminar entitled “The Wines of
Europe.”

The class, which developed into an
enjoyable way for students to increase
their contiguity with the Culture and
art of Europe, was initiated by Moffett
because he finds wine a very ex-
citing subject. He easily makes
analogies between wine and art. The
ability to develop an ear {or music or
a taste for wine takes time, he says,
but anyone can do it.

In general, people are very timid
about criticizing such aspects of
culture as art or wine. They don't want
to look silly when their tastes don’t
agree with the “experts.” According
to Moiiett, when coming into contact
with art or culture, a person should
trust his or her own taste. "Your taste

. is worth something,” he maintains.
“Learn to know what the experts think
is good, but once you've done (that),
then choose your own.” Said Moifett,
“if the critics rave over some play
and you think it stinks, say it stinks,
Trust your judgment—something’s
wrong with the play, not you. Par-
ticularly if you have developed your
tastes." He believes that the people
who have courage to voice their own
convictions are the ones who help
mold culture throughout the ages.

London provides a good atmosphere
to explore tastes in wine. A Variety of
wines can be found there which are
not available in the United States. To
begin the course, the dozen students
were given names of local wine mer-
chants and urged to drink as much
wine as possible outside of class.

At the weekly class meetings,
Spanish, French, and ltalian wines of
varying quality and expense were
discussed, There were usually tour or
live bottles of Wine—two inexpensive,
one average, and one or two
expensiveiat each session. The idea,
according to Moffett, was to “put into
language a non-linguistic experience."

One initial problem was the lack of
descriptive words for tastes and smells,
but this was overcome by the imagina-
tions of the students. Mike Lyons, a
student in the class, described one
wine as having a ”musty red color,
and it smelled and tasted like old
leather." Another exceptionally bad .
wine was described as tasting like an
old shoe, he said.

When the wme began to affect heads
as well as palates, the discussion

. usually drifted onto other subjects.
Said Lyons, “The group became a
hashing groupia place to get to-
gether and talk through our ex-
periences in London.“

The main purpose oi the class,

Lyons felt, was to find what wine
suited your taste. "What i like became
kind of consistent. I came to the
realization that I had my own ape
preciation ({or Wine) which was just
as valid as, though different from,
everyone else’s," said Lyons. The
course was consummated by a potluck
gourmet dinner with a bottle of wine
provided by each class member,

The success of the London seminar
prompted Molfett to heed the advice of
his students and Offer a Grinnell class.
Response to last week’s Campus

Memo ad has been overwhelming,
though the nature of the course calls
for only a small number of par-
ticipants. Motfetl wants the group to
be an equal mixture oi students and
non-students,

ln consolation to those who do not
get in, Moffett emphasizes that the
seminar has “nothing to do, officially,
with Grinnelliit’s totally on the side.”

Although the Grinnell seminar will
have the same format as the one in
London, the focus will be American

Maryland Legislature, 1635-1789.”

According to the book's publisher,
Johns Hopkins University Press, the
work is a “ploneering project in col-
lective biography.” The new publica-
tion provides a means for more ac-
curate interpretation ot political
developments in colonial America,
Containing authoritative membership
lists and data on the 1,445 lawmakers
who served in the Maryland Assembly
during the 154 year period.

Jordan said that "the extensive
social analysis that the biographies
make possible will lead to new studies
of the rise of representative govern-
ment in Maryland and to a _
new understanding oi politics in early
America.”

Jordan prepared biographies on all
of the Maryland legislators who held
office prior to 1715, authoring approx~
rmately onerthird of the new volume.
He is currently at work on a volume
