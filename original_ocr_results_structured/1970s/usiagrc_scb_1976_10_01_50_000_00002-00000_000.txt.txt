First meeting of

by Anti Staplelmi

The Grinnell College Women's
group held its tirst meeting oi the
semester on Tuesday night in the
Women’s Center, located in Smith
Annex Approximately twenty
women attended. Jane Casto, who
initiated the gathering, outlined
possible activities tor the group to
pursue this year Her suggestions
included the promotion of feminist
films. concerts, and lecture series
on campus. the establishment oi
consciousness raising groups and
the creation oi seli-help
organizations. Also; the women's
group plans to explore the
possibility oi providing Grinnell
women with transportation to
other towns and cities for
specialized gynecological care not
available in Grinnell

The group discussed plans ior a
“Women’s Weekend" on campus
The members hove to invite
women who are prominent in the
fields of politics and the arts.
Focus will be on lectures,
discussions. and entertainment

supporting aiiirmative, action
policies will be one of the Women's
group's major Concerns. it was
suggested that some members of
the group combine forces with the
Concerned Sludents' committees
now examining the Issues put iorth
in Turner's “White Paper.”

The women exchanged ideas on
what they hoped to accomplish in
the group. One woman hoped to
avoid the iragmentation often
associated with the women‘s
movement. She felt that a Women's
Grinnell could be a
productive way in which to channel
political energy,

couraged to use the Center ior a

plans .
approved

by Bob Mitchell

Having received official
authorization to proceed on their
plans for the 1976-77 edition of the
Grinnell yearbook, the two student
coeditors are now in the process of
soliciting subscriptions. .5

Juniors Carin DePree and Van
Tsagaris secured official per
mission to continue their work on
the yearbook ata meeting with the ,
Student Publications and Radio‘-
Committee last Tuesday.
Yesterday, they began a Sub-
scription drive with people
stationed outside of Cowles and
Quad dining halls seeking to in-
terest students in the $12 book
Tomorrow, there will be a booth in
the Forum irom lp.m. to 3 pm. to
get parents and other interested
people to subscribe.

Currently, the yearbook staff is
operating with a projected budget
of $7000, $1426 of which is from
donations. The difference, ac-
cording to Tsagaris, will be made \
up by the subscriptions and ads
vertisir'ig revenues.

The staii is in the process oi
planning layouts and staii
photographers have also begun t -
get pictures for the 200 page, nine,
by-twelve book.

The approval oi the yearbook
project by the Student Publications
and Radio Committee caps a
difficult period for the yearbook,_
one which saw it nearly disconr
linued because of staff dissension
and iinancial irregularity.

DePree and Tsagaris in-
tervened last year when the
Committee decided not to fund a
yearbook. SGA’s reticence to make
a financial commitment resulte
from the fact that past yearbooks
had run up a debt that at one time
reached $3400, SGA budget surveys
also indicated that there was .
marginal student interest in _
purchasing a book.

Tsagarls, admitting he sounded
possibly overly optimistic, said he
expects the hook to be good.
