QUARTET

by Robert Ruhl

what does a String Quartet do
after they have finished their con-
cert schedule? In the case of the
Manhattan String Quartet they will
teach at a music camp and per
form at a music festival in Greece.

The last concert that the Quartet
gave featured their friend and col-
league Karel Husa, composer-in-
Residence at Cornell. During the
lirst, half or the‘ concert, Mr. l-lusa
explained various compositional 1dr
eas and devices that he used in wrr
iting his Pulitzer Prize-winningQUr
artet No. 3. After a brief intermis-
sion, the Quartet resumed the stage
to play Mr. Husa's Quartet. This
excellent periormance was aided by
Mr, Husa’spreliminary explanation,
which showed how the separate par
rts of the music related to each
other. The audience was able to
“see" the music and receive more
from the music than if the Quartet
just played the music without any
explanations. Mr. Husa has been
commissioned by the Manhattanoue
artet to write a quartet for them.
This work will be Mr, Husa’s fourth
quartet and will be ready in Sept-
ember of 1974,

The Manhattan Quartet is not to-
.tally through with their concerts
s‘ince they will play at Baccalaur—
eate on May 22. This concert will
also be the tirst Grinnell appear
ance of the new Second violinist,
Mahlon Darlington. Who was diSr
charged from the Army May 4 and
is highly regarded by the Quartet,
Eric Lewis said the audition turned
into more ot a “musical orgy” as
the four of them played piece after
piece with everyone getting along
very we'll with everyone else.

Besides resting this summer, the
Quartet is planning on participating
in two events. The iirst, in early
July, is teaching and performing at
the international Music Camp inNor
rth Dakota. The second event has
the Manhattan Quartet playing in
Greece at ‘a music festival spans»
ored by the Greek government. John
Corigliano, Composerrin-residence
at Manhattan School of Music is the
Artistic Director for this festival.
Judith Glyde described their trip
and performance as both a vacation

ot the “greatest good oi society.”
But since the notion that some men
must live at the expense of others
is the essence of collectivismrthe
liberals defeat their own cause.
Now some may contend that so
long as no one notices that the
civil rights laws were founded on
collectivist political ideology, then
the liberals aren’t fostering racism.
However, those who accept this
argument are participating in the
very confusion I am speaking of.
Namely, not only do people see this
connection but the collectivist ideo»
logy upon which such laws are foun-
ded is not and cannot be limited
to one half of one issue. That is to
the degree that people acquiese to
such selfrinduced blindness theyare
magnitying the conceptual contusion,
and to the degree to which they ac-
cept the rationale for such laws
(collectivism) they develop attitudes
and beliefs which create racism.
Let me expand on this second point
with a further illustration. It was
assumed by many that school inte-
zratioh would he a major stepin des-
troying racism. Hence even after it
was found that the quality or educar

and work. The Quartet has only
recently found out about this fess
tival, so final details have not yet
been worked out

Next year (1973»74) will be a busy
year for the members of the Quar-
tet. Mr. Lewis will Continue the
chamber music programand Andrew
Berdahl will conduct the orchestra.
Violin, viola, cello, and viola de
gamba lessons are given by the
Quartet members to all levels of
students. First semester next year
Ms. Glyde and Mr Darlington are
teaching a freshman tutorial enti-
tied “The Essence of the String
Quartet." Second semester Mr.
Berdahl will teach World Music and

Performs And Plans Summer

Ms. Glyde will teach Music Pedae
EOEY-

For those in the College Community
who prefer to listen to Manhattan
Quartet periormances, they will
present ten concerts next year. The
music ranges from late Beethoven
to a Bartok Cycle—-three Bartok str
ring quartets a night on two nights
separated by a week or two.

The conclusion of the Quartet’s
first summer finds them looking
tor-ward to an exciting summer oi
music and travel, playing withanew
violinist, and preparation tor a new
concert in their second year at
Grinnell.

Husa Blends Ari Anti Commentary

by Nick Marzano

In 1968, Russian troops invaded
Czechoslovakia It was an incident
that some found shocking and ot-
hers insigniticant. But to one man,
it was a personal assault against
his home and his ideals. Karel Husa
was so moved by the abrasiveness
of the invasion that he Wrote one
of his finest compositions to come
memorate the lives that were lost
there, Music tor progue I968.

Karel Husa, composerrinrresiden-
ce at Cornell University, has won a
Pulitzer prize for his String Quar-
tet No. 3. The awardrwinning Como
position was performed last Monday
night by the Manhattan string Quarr
tet in Roberts Theatre. .

Husa was on hand to discuss his
piece in detail and educate the re-
latively small audience on same ol
the newer inventions of contemporr
ary music that he employs in his
compositions. The use of lZ-tone,
ouarteratone. and unusual howings
creates an intensity and excitement

last Of New

Ira L. Strauber has been appointed
to an assistant professorship in the
Department of Politcal Science.

strauber, a graduate of Queens
College in New York, took his mass
ter’s degree at Northwestern Unis
versity and did his doctoral work
at Brown Unive t

tion did not improve, many believe
that integration was inherently good.
(To know one’s neighbor is to love
him etc...). Since then a lot has been
said and very little accomplished
so I shall just point out the flaw
in the argument. Although the (for
gree oi literacy olten stands in in,
verse ratio to the degree otracism,
the belief in racism is not primarily

due to peon mentality, but rather to
the moral, value orientation otan in-
dividual. it a person realizes that
just as he must be materially (ear
onomically) a selfrmade man so too
he must ‘be spiritually (inner sells
worth) a self-made man, then he
will never seek not desire the une
earned. So long as one reyects this
view and believes in collectivism
then one’s orientation will be the
desire to take that which one doesn’t
earn. it is this desire tor the une
earned which lead men to accept
collective worth; that can only be
accomplished by attributing to other
collectives (races, iamilies, etc.),
collective disworth.

What is at stake is more impor-
tant than just the tiiture ol mankind;
what is at stake is your future.

String Quartet No. 3 was written
in 1967-8 and received the Pulit—
zer prize in the spring of 1963. The
work was a commission from the
Fine Arts Quartet in Chicago who
first performed the piece. Since
then, String Quartet No. 3 has been
performed by dozens of quartets
and on national television.

Karel I-Iusa's newest work is a
piece for Orchestra called Apothe»
nsis of this Earth. It is his state
ment on ecology and modern man
in which, fittingly, the earth is
destroyed at the end of the second
movement. Mr. Husa calls his new
work “a picture in music that I
hope will never happen." So was
Music for Prague lass.
