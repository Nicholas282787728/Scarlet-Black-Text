Four years ago last October, a delegation of
students came to me to discuss what they perceived
as an increase in tension experienced by many
students and seemingly related to academic demands
and performance They attributed the apparent
“academic pressure" to an increase in assignments
and academic demands by the faculty, problems ivitli
a grading system, a “fairly rigid set of curricular
requirements,” and clustering of deadlines for
assignments during two or three periods of the
semester. A series of Informal discussions developed
which raised the level of awareness of the entire
College community to the problem Over the next
year or So several Changes occurred which might
have had an effect on the problem such as the in-
stitution of a “no requirements curriculum" and the
establishment of a “grade—erase” grading system.
The faculty ivas requested to consider the problem
when developing their course syllabi. in spite of these
changes. the problem seems to have persisted over
the last four years.

Two years ago i attempted to develop some data
related to the perceived problem by conducting a
survey of student and faculty opinion on the matter.

courses was “just right,” but nearly 23 percent
at them wanted “less reading and additional
other assignments ” This supported the earlier
linding that a substantial number of students
felt there were “too few written and oral
assignments."

SOURCES or HELP

in response to the question, ”ll you ex-
perlenced academic difficulty last semester,
did you seek help from college staff mem
bers?" an percent of the students responded
yes, 41.0 percent said no, and 20.3 percent did
not answer the question of the students who
sought help, however, nearly 77 percent found
the help useiiil. This help was solicited from the
following individuals: Professorsi-Bfe per
cent; Faculty Adviser —39.9 percent; Resident
Advisers—6.5 percent: Othersisﬁ percent;

Director of Academic Advisingiza percent:
and Student Deans—l 9 percent.

From a preplanning point of view, 55.5
percent oi the students felt their “faculty
adviser did his-her best” in helping to plan
their course load. Slightly more than 52 percent
of the students surveyed and 75 percent of ihe
faculty ielt students “could have eliminated
some ni their academic pressure by better
planning their course load ii.e. by balancing
reading and writing courses, science courses,
courses in the fine arts, etc.) A number of
students commented that in theory this would
be a nice idea, but that in fact they were
already. committed to a particular program oi
study and could not balance their workloads
more evenly.

NON-ACADEMIC FACTORS

Students were asked an optional question on
their use of amphetamines. Twentyrfour
percent of the students surveyed reported
taking amphetamines and nearly so percent of
these students used them more than four times
during the semester. The major reason for
students taking amphetamines was “too much
work" (58 percent). with “poor_planning" as a
secondary reason (23.5 percent).

A'large majority oi the students (72.5 per-
cent) did not feel that their present housing
situation contributed to their feelings of
academic pressure. Those students living in co-
ed dormitories, however, registered the
greatest dissatisfaction and commented about
lhe continuous high level of noise and their
inability to study in their own rooms.

ISSUES RELATED To CURRICULUM

In their written comments, many students
complained about the current grading system
and how much it contributed to their feelings of
academic pressure. As a result, a series of
questions was included in the faculty
questionnaire which related specifically to this
issue.

The faculty response to the question, “How
do you feel the present grading system reflects
the relative quality of student work?" was as
follows: “extremely well"—0.0 percent; “as
well as any system would”4l.5 percent;
”poorly/"#543 percent; and no answer—37
percent. A large number of students asked for a
return to the creditrfail option in the grading

system and 54 percent of the faculty agreed
with them in response to a speciiic question.

Finally, a question about the “no
requirements curriculum” brought this
relatively inconclusive result irom the faculty:
“Do you believe that the current ‘no
requirements curriculum' bears any responr
sibility for the academic pressure that the
students have reported to be on the increase
over the last three years (Since the advent of
the new curriculumli" Yes~28il percent;

Apnqs aanssaud :I

The lollowing summary was preparod
by Kathie euro" of the President's
office under the direction of the Dean 0!
the college, Waldo walker.

During the pastsemester, the survey was repeated in
an effort to compare the earlier results with those
from an updated survey, The analyses of these data
are contained in the summary report shown
elsewhere on this page.

in the following comments I address my remarks to
my perceptions of factors which contribute to
academic pressure at Grinnell and to possible steps
which the College and the students may take to try to
minimize this problem.

Academic I’rcssnrihColliributingFactors

After many discussions with representatives of
other colleges, i am convinced that academic
pressure is not unique to this College. There may be a
few of the causative factors that are unique to
Grinnell but the problem exists in varying degrees in
colleges of Gl'innell's type throughout the country. it
also appears to me that there is a direct propor-
tionality between the degree of such tension and the
academic quality of an institution.

My second observation is that preoccupation with

discussion of the existence of such pressure Without
the development of some hard data concerning the
problem results in its escalation. Four years ago the
tension became considerably increased in part at
least through the extended discussions of “academic
pressure.”
, Clearly, many students and faculty members
believe that 3 Significant share of the academic
pressure is either Seleposed or is imposed by
certain elements of contemporary society. Students
appear to have swung away from their desire of the
late 60’s to balance their interest in academic pur-
suits with interests in national, international, and
other academic issues and concerns. This may be in
part the result of continuing student disillusionment
with a Culture that they are unable to change. The
total preoccupation of students with academic
matters may also be indicative of a general ebb in
morale ofyoung people. This might be expected when
one considers the current slump in the national
economy, the poor job market, uncertainty about the
future, and a general increase in questioning con-
cerning the ultimate marketable value of a college
education The tension may also result from the fact
that many of our stlidents have come to realize for the
first time that we are all members of a very “per-
formanceoriented" society. This effect in many
instances may be ampliiied by parental pressure for
high performance of their offspring. The problem is
extended significantly by the increasing difficulty
that students experience in attaining admission to
graduate and professional schools.

Although these factors are very important and
Contribute significantly to student tensions it must be
recognized that they are a part oi the contemporary
culture and that we have little alternative other than
to accommodate to living with them. We must also
acknowledge that they lie outside of the direct control
of the College. if. at the outset students renngnive that
they will continually be subjected to these tensions, it
may not make the problems easier to deal with, but at
least students will recognize what is happening when
they first become aware of their effects.

Now that I have mentioned some of the extrinsic
iniluences on student pressure problems, i wish to
turn toa number of factors which can be attributed to
the Grinnell situation. These fall Within two
categories: influences under the Control of the faculty
and administration and those under the control of the
students. I would list the following within the
category of factors falling under the control of the
administration and the faculty:

1. The “all or none" principle of evaluation, Most
students find the faculty use of only one or two
evaluative examinations andor one large paper a
tension-creating factor,

2. Coliccptlialilation and expression. The College
tails to teach many of its students to assimilate ab-
Stract concepts and to express their ideas and un-
derstandings clearly and concisely in writing.

3. Excessive assignments. At least some faculty
members appear to neglect the fact that most
students have obligations for three courses other than
their own and heap on assignments that are quite
excessive. The data indicate that it is quite possible
for students in certain areas to have from 5,000 to
3,000 pages of required reading in one semester.
Many students have also reported that not all of the
reading is relevant to the subject under cons
sideration. '

ii. Prudent advising and schedule planning. Ap-
parently some academic advisers either do not
recommend the proper balance of reading, writing or
laboratory courses or they do not convince their
advisees of the sensibility of attaining the proper
balance

5. llurvestiiig the “knowledge explosion." Frequent
comments from faculty members indicate that they
are attempting to pack more into many courses than
ever before. “There is so much more to cover now
than there was in 1964" is a common comment from
faculty members.

ii. The gratlixlgsystcul. Although lt has long been a
perennial probloin no matter what the grading
system, it appears to me that our current system
tends to enhance grade inflation and may encourage
study for the wrong reasons

7. The “locked in" environment. The College has
failed to develop an adequate program to relieve the
students’ feelings that they are unable to escape from
the all-encompassing academic environment at the
College

8. The “two cultures” problem. The College has not
been concerned enough with education of the “whole
person.” This should include an integration of the
academic program of the College with the social and
cultural life of thestudcnt.

The second category consists of factors that Con»
tribute to student tension and that generally fall
under the control of the students themselves.

i. The “oiienpiuansliip” syndi-onic. l believe that
most members of the Grinnell College Community
are caught up in the game of trying to impress
everyone around them with how hard they have to
work. People not only feel that they have to play the
“can you top this?" game of talking about how hard
they must work, but they also have to assume the
posture of working hard whether they are producing
or not. Even I. the great paragon of wisdom about
academic pressure, am guilty of this.

2. Work scheduling and planning. Students do not
make an cilort to pace themselves over the semester
in regard to their work output, Many let assignments
pile up until they are forced to “all nighters” and
“catching up at the cnd of the semester."

3. Schedule planning atrocities. Students frequently
do not use good sense in scheduling of courses.
Achieving a proper balance of courses with reading,
writing, and laboratory assignments is ircquently not
thought of at the time of registration.

a. “All work and no play” work ethic. Many
students Seem unable to balance work periods with
revitalizing breaks without developing a ieellng of
guilt for so doing. in many instances this leads to
sitting and thinking about the work and not ac-
complishing it.

5. The ”I‘m no brother‘s keeper“ competi on
factor. Many students have expressed to me their
inability to obtain help from others in a class because
of the other’s fear or giving up their edge by helping
“the competition." Studying with someone else is
very frequently most beneficial to both parties

Ii. Poor student involvement in non-academic
programs. Although the College may be remiss in not
providing some avenue for students to escape from
the campus, it is certainly not remiss in providing
cultural and entertaining activities for student
consumption on campus. Students simply do not avail
themselves of the extensive programs that are
always available. The commonly voiced statement
that there are too many activities to attend may be
valid, but it is not a good excuse [or students not at
tending anything.

Recoinuieiidations

As suggested earlier, several steps may be taken
that may, in part, relieve the pressure problem at the
College.

1. Students should acknowledge that a certain level
of pressure is an inevitable and in some cir~
cumstances even a desirable characteristic of the
academic environment at a college like Grinnell.
Students and iacuity should attempt to keep the
pressure in proper perspective, which is, of course,
easier said than done.

2, Faculty members may help ease the pressure
problem by guarding against making assignments
that exceed the needs of the course being taught. A
reduced amount of required reading well assimilated
and understood by students is likely to net greater
returns for the studentthan a great amountthat is not
well understood.

3. Faculty members should also evaluate student
performance more frequently than once or twice a
semester, especially for students in the first two
years.

4. false believe that, in many cases. courses may
be taught more effectively if less material is Covered
and a more thorough job of covering the limited
material is done.

5, The administration and the laculty must can»
tinually strive to improve the advising system. Some
academic pressure can be relieved if the advisers,
relying upon their experience, make more definitive
recommendations concerning academic programs of
students and if the students heed the advisers‘
recommendations.

6. I believe that the College must emphasize the
skills needed to understand and deal with concepts.
Introductory courses in the various areas should
stress this aspect of the discipline.

7. Certainly the College must continue to stress the
development of writing skills and the importance of
this mode of selfvexpression.

8. i also propose that the College undertake a
thorough rel-evaluation of the character and use of the
current grading system. I support the relnstitution of
a credit grade to help influence students to take
certain courses which they may need, but which they
Will not register for if they are to be subjected to the
fine discriminations of a grade~oriented evaluation.

9, The College should seriously study the feasibility
of providing some regularly scheduled opportunities
for students to go to Des Moines, Iowa City, Ames,
and perhaps the Amanas. it is surprising how
refreshing an afternoon or evening away from town
can be.

10 Members of the faculty and adini isti’ation
should always hear in mind that in a residential
college community the College has an obligation to
minister to the personal and social needs of the
student as well as to his or her academic needs, This
cannot be done passively but must be approached
through an active program to integrate the three
areas of the students’ Grinncll experience. I intend to
do my best to see that the College makes progress in
this area.
