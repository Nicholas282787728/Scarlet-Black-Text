Unsafe conditions

Two other schools, the Cooper School and Parker
Elementary School, were closed by the Board oi
Education iollowing a study released by the state
lire marshall. The study showed that the two
schools and the present junior high are lacking in a

number oi saiety ieatures.

since they are residents oi the school district, 1E

years or older, and us, citizens. The polling place
ior on-campus students is Bailey Park Elementary
School, 210 Eighth Avenue.

the College‘s taxes, although minimal, since the

buildings related to education, including the dorms.

College where strong emphasis is
placed on Western culture. He,
Richard Cervene, Charles Cleaver
and Joseph Wall are members of
the planning committee for the
symposium

According to Wall and Cleaver,
the curriculum has never dealt
much with the American West.
Due to this fact and because
Grinnell is right on the edge of the
West, the symposium is an attempt
to provide information about the
area

The planning committee is
cooperating with the Student Social
Committee to have a series of
Western movies shown. Also, Mr.
Cervene is trying to get an exhibit
of contemporary lndian artists to
put on display during the week.

Greyhound rolls 7
on temporaryOK

by Tom Pantea

Greyhound Bus Lines tentatively
settled a week—long drivers‘ strike
Sunday morning. Details of the
new contract are not being
disclosed until after the
ratiiication vote by union memr
bers.

The strike left Urinnell and
many other towns along central
Iowa with no transportation to
other parts oi the state and
country, creating a problem' for
students beginning to look for a
way home for Christmas. Since the
settlement is only a tentative one
and may be turned down by the
vote of the rankrand-file. it may be
necessary to iirid other modes of
transportation.

Ride finders

First there is the ride by car.
Rides and riders to most areas in
the continental U S. can be found
by using the ride board in the Post
oilice, and KDIC ride service,
wantrads in the Scarlet and Black,
a note in the Campus Memo, and
lposters on bulletin boards
throughout the campus.

In the face oi a Greyhound
strike, Continental Trail Ways Bus
Lines could be used irom Des
Moines. Buses to Des Moines or
Cedar Rapids go to airports having
commercial airlines with daily
scheduled ilights.

Traintravel

A trip by train is a little more
difficult. The Closest Amtrak
stations are in Ottumwa and Fort
Madison, which have no con-
necting bus service to Grinnell.
Fort Madison is the depot for trains
going west to Los Angeles, 0t-
tumwa for those going cast or
northwest to San Francisco.
