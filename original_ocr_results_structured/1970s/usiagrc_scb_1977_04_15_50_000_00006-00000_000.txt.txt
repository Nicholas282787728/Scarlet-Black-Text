Now showing at the Bijou

by Bill Waldner

This week's Iilm, The «in Blows,
was the first feature film of former
film Critic and “new Wave" French
director. Francois Truffaut.
Truffaut is ‘a prolific director
(Shoot the Piano Player: The Wild
Child; Jules and Jim: Fahrenheit
451: Day for Night, shown on
campus first semester; and
recently Small Change) who never
tails to bring a very “human”
feeling to the screen in his films.
l-le lava people and understands
them. and I think he has a par-
ticular affinity for children. He
knows what it is that makes
children tick. 400 Blows is the
semirautobiographical story at
Truffaut's own Childhood.

The story concerns a twelve:
year-old child. Antoine. At twelve
he already knows that his “father"
married his mother only after his

own illegitimate birth. He also
knows that his mother is not faith-
ful to his tamer. Worst at all, he
knows that neither his father nor
his mother are particularly in»
terested in him:

The 400 Blows is a moving,
chilling film; a masterpiece of
French cinema. In contrast to the
kind of garbage that comes out of
Hollywood these days (“ . . . aw
heck, those are just ‘fun‘ films,
y'know? none of this artsy Stuff if
y'get what I'm sayin”), films like
Trulfaut’s are especially
remarkable.

Gone are the Days (Purlie
Victorious) and The River Niger
were the films chosen for Black
Martyrs' Weekend. Purlie.
starring Ossie Davis, is the film
adaption of his Broadway play, it
is the story of a self-ordained black

preacher named Purlie Victorious
Judson, who wants to buy a barn in
Georgia and convert it into an
integrated church. Ruby Dee and
most of the original Broadway cast
play the supporting roles in this
highspirited satire.

The River Niger is another
adaptation, from the Broadway
play of the same name. Cicely
Tyson, James Earl Jones, and Lou
Gossett are among the cast
members in this film about
growing up, living, and perhaps
escaping from the grasp of the
ghetto. A critic in Cinema Com-
pendium said at The River Niger,
“The River Niger is a dynamic,
pull~no—punches ﬁlm and
features solid performances by
Tyson and Jones, Add to all of this
a soundtrack Written and per-
formed by WAR. , ."
