Maybe the way to change the world
Is to iom a large corporation.

We don’t make a lot of noise, but this is where it's
really happening.You see, a large corporation like Kodak has
the resources and the skill to make this world a little-more dc-
cent place to live. And we intend to do what we can to see
that this is exactly what happens.

Take our home city, Rochester, New York for cxarne
ple. We cut water pollution in the Genesee River by using
natural bacteria to dispose of unnatural wastes. We cut air
pollution by using electrostatic precipitators in a new corn-
bustible waste disposal facility. We helped set up a black
enterprise program in downtown Rochester, and we've been
experimenting with film as a way to train both teachers and
studentseincluding some students who wouldn‘t respond to
anything else.

And we didn't stop with Rochester. Kodak is involved
in 47 countries all over the world. Actively involved.

Why? Because it’s good business. Helping to clean
the Gencsce River not only beneﬁts society...but helps pro-
tect another possible source tor the clean water we need to
make our him. Our combustible waste disposal iacility not
only reduces pollution...but just about pays for itself in
heat and power production and silver recovery. Our black
enterprise program not only provides an opportunity for the
economically disadvantaged...but helps stabilize communi-
ties in which Kodak can operate and grow. And distributing
cameras and ﬁlm to teachers and students not only helps
motivate the children. .buthelps create a whole new market.

In short. it’s simply good business. And we’re in busi-
ness to make a proﬁt. But in lurthcring our business interests,
we also further society’s interests.

And that’s good. Alter all, our business depends on
society. So we care what happens to it.

Kodak

More than a business.
