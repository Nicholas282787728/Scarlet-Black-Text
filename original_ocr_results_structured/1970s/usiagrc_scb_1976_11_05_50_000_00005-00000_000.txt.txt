in a country founded on prin»
ciples oi equality can dis»
criinination aga1nst it majoiity
(53 per Cent) of its inhabitants be
justified? This question has led to
extensive litigation by courts
thoughout the country which
have upheld that affimative action
is necessary it sex discrimination
is to end. Despite all such litigation
it seems that President Turner

ﬁnmes somehow that Grinnell
allege Is special and should be
exempt from laws the rest of
society should lollow. It is essential
that Grinneil adopt an eiicctivc
ﬁlrmalivc action plan so as to end
(Tie obvious pattern oi
discrimination in the past and to
pieveilt the continuation or current
discrimination,

The essence of an affirmative
action plan is the establishment of
a strong polic' and commitment
by the administration. This is
primary. Without this little change
can or will take place, what is
needed is to set speciiic
measurable goals with target
dates The administration is then
responsible and accountable tor

cling the goals and objectives

in there the administration
must develop procedures ior
implementing the goals

These goals are targets the
mministration tries to achieve. it

dllS to meet the goals and can
documentits efforts it has filled its
legal responsibility as the
obligation to meet goals is not
absolute But. the administration
must be able to document that it
has genuinely tried to recruit, hire
and promote women and
minorities, ,The goals and
timetables are used as measures of
progress. not as binding
obligations. They give some way to
ﬂcnge administrative asser»

oi “good will" it the question
of sex discrimination should arise
again.

President Turner has argued

eatedly that eniorcement oi an

. irmzitive action program with
goals and timetables (which is
what an affirmative action
program is) at Grinnell would
somehow compromise the
scholarly excellence to which this
institution is committed (This
implies oi course that women and
minorities are almost by definition
not qualified and as such must be
judged by lower standards it they
are to be considered qualified ) No

has any intention oi trying to
force the administration or the
faculty to hire less qualitied

‘>te, what is required is a
go uine, good iaitii etiort to hire
women and minorities. Good faith
does not mean calling one's vlhite,
male friends asking ior
suggestions on a good man and
then responding to accusations of
sex discrimination with such
comments as_.[ would have loved
to hire 2i woman but there were
none qualified for the position.

An employer may not require
any pregnant employees to take a
leave ofabsence at aspecified time
before delivery date.

An employer may not establish
diiierent benefits—pensions,
retirement, insurance and health
plansifor male employees than
tor temale employees.

An employer can not only
disobey the Equal Employment
Opportunity laws when it is acting
intentionally or with ill motive. but
can do so unintentionally as well,

in light of administrative Hts
titudes and the past and present
status of women at Grinnell
College. it seems obvious that sex
discrimination on campus is a
problem, It is a problem that air
tools every member ot the campus
commiinit ill is :1 problem with
legal ramifications, It is so obvious
In its manifestations that it cannot
and must not be ignored.

I still think we live in an amazing
country

This belief was reaffirmed over
fall break as a friend and l
travelled to Boston Via New York
City. My iriend, a pro-med who
Just came out of the closet. is from
a suburb of Washington, D C. and
is somewhat familiar with urban
settings I am a native iowan
tascinated by big cities. but at the
same time harboring an instinctive
tear oi anything taller than a grain
elevator. Together We set out to
experience the great Northeast,
our trip inspired by the biccnr
tennlal and the prospect oi ircc
lodgings.

In New York We spent the night
in the apartment of two budding
young actresses. They took us to
see an iiii-oli Broadway play in
which a friend of theirs tanolher
budding young actressl was
performing. I concluded that
nearly everyone in New York
between the ages of 18 and 2515 a
budding young actorvactress and
while all oi them are constantly
acting, a very small percentage
manages to get on the stage at any
one time Aiter the periormance
we went to the apartment of the
actively engaged actress and had a
small. social gathering.

One cannot do justice to
Manhattan (assuming an injustice
is possible) without a brief
discussion of apartments. During
my abbreviated stay 1 concluded
that roaches form the basis for
apartment pricing The two acV
tresses' apartment was on the
poorer East Side and had a kit-
chen, living room. and one and a
half bedrooms with linoleum floors
and papered walls. it went tor $290
a month, Their friend’s place in the
Village was much smaller, had
shag carpeting. painted walls, and
went for $350. The obvious cons
clusion is that the second apartr
ment was more expensive because

roaches cannot climb painted walls,

and they remain hidden in shag
carpeting,
