After much thinking. I've come
to the conclusion that graduation
ceremonies are the height oi
unreality.

After all. hovi seriously can you
take a tworhour ccrcmony at which
the two most remarkable
characteristics are black gowns
and a lot sun? By 1 pm. the
graduates are rapidly approaching
medium rare ,and the faculty's
already overdone,

Someone once said that
marriage ceremonies, ban
mitzvahs and exercises of com-
mencement are purely symbolic
and hence should never be taken
yery seriously. i guess i agree
although at this point l'in not
married, bar-mitzvahctl or
graduated

How can you ask someone to end.

lifc.Sliap. just like that? And
dressed in black. for goodness
sake. Like I said. it's unreal.

that all of a sudden It's over?
Friends. it's either been over for a
long time. hasn't started yet. or is
just not going to stop. I (lon'l

It'S illl just someplace in lictwcon

And yet, a ceremony steeped in
ilnreality is probably a lilting
comment on tour years that have

Think about it~you’vo got lots at

And yet liic here has been one

have we been so abused Never

with graduation, the paradox
mainilests itself one more time.
never have we wanted to leave so
badly, and never have we wanted
so to stay. -

And what have we learned“!
Everlhing and nothing, my now
you should have expected an an»
swer like that.) The Courses have
been wonderful. enlightening.
thrilling. And yet there have been
nights when one wonders whether
it's possihlc to learn anything.
whethereycrything aner Dr Seuss
is simply rehash

“Social" learning lGrinnell's big
on that) has been no different, At
times you lecl as though you‘ve
matured tremendously since ihose
wonderful ”New Student Days." At
other times. you tool as though
you've nctually regressed, that

or you -

l tell you. It's almost beyond
understanding The one thing I do
know is that it's been fun, in-
credibly fun. and even now I'm not
sure why. Maybe it's best not to
know. Trying to dissect the exe
periences oi the past rour years is a
little like trying to dissect a hog.
Sure, you tind out all the reasons
why. but the thing dies in the
process

This is no time for an autopsy In
this case. 1 “(int it to live.
