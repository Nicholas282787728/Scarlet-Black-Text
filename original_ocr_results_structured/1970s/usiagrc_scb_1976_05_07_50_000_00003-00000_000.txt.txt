Voice opinions

To the Editor:

I was pleased by the number oi
personal responses that l've
received during this past week to
my open mace regarding the
position cut in the educational
department. As grateful and en
couraged as I am by such
responses, I feel that they’re
misdirected. it you’ll read my
letter-to-Lhe-editor that is in this
issue, you'll realize that comments
of agreement or disagreement are
only oi value to me in a personal
sense, but really don't do you a
whole lot of good except to let you
blow off some Charge. What l’dlike
to suggest is that it you really do
agree, voice your agreement with
the people who make the decisions:
the deans, the executive council.
the faculty, and the President.
Some of them will listen, some
need to be made to listen, but none
of them will hear you unless
something is Said. Get Lhose cards
and letters (phone calls, office
calls, etc.) going in liBoh Tracey
