dozen or a dozen people whose

Making the decision in partia
cular cases is more difficult
than stating the general poli-
cy, because it is not always
easy to evaluate the quality of
a given faculty member.

The decision is usuallybased
upon four things: 1) the de-
sire of the department toproe
mote 2) scholarly achieve-
ments 3) service to the Col—
lege and 4) effectiveness as
a teacher.

Teaching effectiveness is es
pecially difficultto determine,
since there is no set method of
judging the quality of instruc-
tion. Colleagues rarely sit in
on a faculty member's clas~
sea.

"There is very little thatyou
am objectively get ahold of"
to make the evaluation, so ex<
cept‘where the teacher is ob
viously poor or outstanding,
the decisions are difficult.

“We must have a more sys*
tematic way of evaluating tea-
chers than we do now." Re
cently at least, Grinnell has
"always backed away from a
decision on setting up this
sort of system, because we
thought it could be misused."

All of which raises the ques*
tion: who is it that is respon-
sible for making the decisions
in these matters at Grinnell?

According to the by- laws of
the College, "everything
comes to the President as a
recommendation," so pre-
sumably that is where the
buck stops in promotion and
salary decisions as well.

mendations have a great deal

has the final word in such
matters.

What about student evalu-
ations? How useful and reli-
able are they? “Student opin-
ion about teaching ability is
"fairly valuable" in Cletermk
ning a teacher's effectiveness.

Even though a few students
fail to accurately and hon-
estly evaluatea tea cher, under
a good student evaluation sysr
tern about ninety per cent of
the opinions fall in the same
range.

Leggett does not feel that
there is a tendency to over
rate a professor who is len-
ient with students. When he
taught at the University of
Washington, the school would,’
at the teacher’s request, send
a crew of evaluators into the
classroom to conduct the test.
The teacher would be askedto
leave and the students to come
plete a questionaire.

”I was always, impressed by
the importance students pla-
ced" in the attitude of the
teacher toward the subject
matter. A teacher who was
underprepared or unclear
would often be given higher
overall ratings by his stu-
dents, bemuse somehow itwas
clear to his students that he
really enjoyed teaching the
course. Aprotessorwhoyawn-
ed through his own lectures
was given very little mercy,
even though he had outstanding
technique and preparation.

The results of this evalua-
tion would be given to the
teacher at the end ofthe term,
after grades had been re-
corded. There was littlevarr
ation from student to student
and from class to class in the
ratings a particularinstructor
received. About ninety per
cent of the student opinions

would hit at about the same
level.

Torr Cldrifies Siudrenizbefie'rnieiii Policy

Dr. Qirtls W. Tarr, National
Director of Selective Service
System, has written all local
Selective Service board offi‘
ces that he wishes to clarify
the expected policy changes
on undergraduate student de~'
ferments.

Dr. Tarr said college stu-
dents who were enrolled full~
time in the 1970- 71 academic
year will be eligible for stu-
dent deferments in the l97l~
72 school year if they con-
tinue to make satisfactory
progress in their programs of
study. However, young men
who entered school for the
first time this summer and
those who enroll as freshmen
this (all will not qualify for
student deferments since Corr
gress approved last Tuesday
the bill to extend the present
draft law.
Low Draft Calls,

Dr. ’l‘arr said: "Few in-
coming freshmen studentsare
likely to be inducted in the
near future because of the
student deferment phaseout.
Of the 1,034,000 incoming frA
estmen males estimated by
the Ofﬁce of Education, ap-
proximately 80% were born in
1953 and only 20% were born
in 1952 or earlier. The men
born in 1953 will receive their
lettery numbers in 1972, and
they will not be subject to
induction until 1973, when dr-
aft calls should be low. The
men born in 1952 received
their lottery numbers August
5, 1971, and will be subject
to induction next year; at least
1/2 should have high enough
lottery numbers to preclude
their induction. Of these re-
maining, approximately 50%
will be disqualified on mental,
moral or physical grounds.
This means that a maximum
of 50,000 men will be direct-

ly affected in 1972 by the stu-
dent deferment phaseout and
onerhalf of these, or 25,000,
will probably not be inducted
because of enlistments in Re-
gular, Reserve or National
Guard units. participating in
commissioning programs or
because of procedural delays.

Late Induction

Dr. Tarr said that college
students will not be drafted
in the middle of a semester
or term. “If milled while en-
rolled, they will be allowed
to postpone their induction
until the end of the semester,
or term. If in their last
academic year, they will be
able to postpone their induc~
tion until after graduation."
Dr. Tarr advised incoming
freshmen and students who
started their program ofstudy

in the summer of 1971 or la-
ter n0t to file applications for
student deferments even
though the current law auth»
orizes granting deferments to
students in fullrtime progr-
ams of study.

Many Deferments

Currently, there are approx-
imately six million youngmen
under age 35 with deferments.
Approximately 500,000 of
these normally lose their de-
ferments during a 12emonth
period. The largest groups of
deferred men are those who
have received fatherhood, 00‘
cupational or student defer-
ments.

Men who do not understand
their status are encouraged
to contact the local board
ofﬁce in Grinnell, or any of-
fice in their vicinity.

New Fund Guidelines Explained

The initiative- Qiltural Fund
Committee last week held an
organizational meeting to
formulate a general policyst-
atement and set up guidelines
for the dispersal of its all-
otted funds. The finalized
policy statement, approved
last Monday by the Joint
Board, has been distributed
to the SGA offices, Resident
Advisers, and Student Advis-
ers.

Committee Chairman Chip
Shofstall, in an interview
with the S Si B, outlined the
new role of the modified com-
mittee and stated thatTthis
is the first time a fund has.
been set aside especially for
the funding of student-initia-
ted activities. If the money
is wellrspent this year there
is a good chance for more
money being allotted for this

Urban Studies - Will We Have

by Linnett Harlan

Last year's academic re-
shuffiing left Grinnell’s spe*
cial non-major Urban Studies
program in limbo. Urban Stu-
dies, Religious Studies, and
several other upperclass ge-
neral education programs
were established ‘ .several
years ago as a result of the
Haveman Committee’s rer
Commendations. With theabor
lition ofrequirementsat Grlnr
nell, the position oftheseprm
grams is unclear. Will they
be dropped. or will they be
expanded into full depart-
ments?

The question remains unan-
swered ._ the Urban Studies
program, With Mr. Al Jones
as chairman, is listed in the
newest Grinnell bulletin. But
no special courses are of?

feted; the listing consists
merely of courses in the his-
tory, economics, sociology,
and political science depart-
ments which deal with the
problems of urban life. While
several students are using
this listing as a guideline to
an independent major in Ur-
ban Studies, Grinnell has not
committed itself to developing
an Urban Studies department.
If the Urban Studies courses
offered at Grinnell seem in-
adequate, the Grinnell student
may attend a summer Urban
Studies institue, co—sponscr
red by Grinnell, Knox, Car-
leton, and Colorado, at C07
lorado College in Colorado
Springs. The institute includes
studies in urban planning and

desigg and in_ur;ban literature.
Another supplement to Grins
nell urban studies courses

is the ACM Urban Studies

The InitiativeZCultural Fund

otnnents, if not the only one,
that has a great deal of un-
committed financial resource
at its disposal. The funds

like to share with the student

Grinnell students until this

their ideas made workable, so
