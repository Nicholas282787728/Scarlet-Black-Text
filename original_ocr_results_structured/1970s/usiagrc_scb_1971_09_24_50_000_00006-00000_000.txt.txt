Tedermun To look‘ln

by Ann Cassel

Because housing for students
has been tight at Grinnell
these first few weeks of
school, Jim Tederman hasn’t
had much time to formulate
an impression of his new
job as one of the assistant
deans of students (the other
being Marjory Daly). ‘
Most of his time, up to now,
has been spent trying to solve
housing problems andattemp‘
ting to keep peace with those
students who are unsatisfied
with the housing situation.

Emotional Problems

Jim does have some definite
ideas and goals for his job.
He feels that the Student Ad-
visor and Resident Advisor
programs are in need ofim-
provement and he will spend
a lot of time this year in
that area. He plans a series
of workshops to acquaint stu—
dent advisors with ways to
handle situations which may
arise on the floor.
workshops

They will be advised on such
things as recognizing emo-
tional problems before they
become emergencies, how to
effectively deal with crises on
a short term basis, how to
deal with differences in life
styles, and how to handle
theft on the floor. Workshops
in basic first-aid for Student
Advisors have already begun.

SJ. Program
Jim’s concern With improve-
ment of the Student Advisor
program arises from one of
his main goals for the Dean
of Students Officers change
in the image of the office,
so that students will view it
as a place where they can be
helped instead of a discipli-
nary office. Improvement in
the Student Advisor program
can further this goal because
the halls will become self~
governed and little or no and
ministrative intervention will
be necessary.
Group Therapy

Another main concern of
Jim's is the Resident Advisor
program: he feels that the

Resident Advisor program is
for the benefit of the students
and they should have a large
part in its planning.

In addition to working out
these goals. Jim Will be lead-
ing a group therapy session in
conjunction with the mental
health clinic and working ocr
casionally with the Revolving
Door.

Open-Door Policy

last, but far from least,Jim
thinks that personal involve-
ment with students is of vital
importance. He will be avails
able as much as possible for
personal, contact with stu~

' " dents, especially by living in

Cleveland hall and having an
open~door policy in hisapart~
ment.

The change from Resident
Advisor to Assistant Dean of
Students may lessen his in-
volvement in student affairs
and problems and he would
like to be as close to stun
dents as possible despite this
change.

Mr. Jim Tederman and Mrs. Marjory Daly chuckle over
their mutual problems as assistant deans of students.

Marge DnlyNew Style Of Dean

by Janetishuldiner

Grinnell has another ﬁrst to
place in its record book. We
can now boast about our late
est claim to fortune, having
the first American dean who
can speak North Vietnamese.
Yes, Mrs. Marjory Daly,
known to many as Ambassa—
dor Daly from Russian House,
has achieved this distinctive
niche, along with holding the
position of Assistant Dean of
Students here.

Mrs. Daly during her first
few weeks at Grinnell hasmet
many students, but numerous
times the students are un-
aware of her position with the
school. She goes to parties
and meetings and eats most
meals at Quad. Just the other
day she was out for a short
spin on the back of George
Shybut’s motorcycle.

To many students and faculr
ty Mrs. Daly’s approach to the
office of Assistant Deanmight
be a little surprising because
of its fluid, unorthodox ways.
But Mrs. Daly wants to dis-
pense with the old image that
the Dean's office always den
noted discipline.

According to Mrs. Daly, the
Dean's Office is here to "per
form a service to the students,
whether it be counseling, ca-
reer training, workingwith the
RA’s and SA’s, or assisting
in crisis situations."

The most imporat-nt function
of the Dean's Office is thatall
information and conversations
be kept confidential. Mrs.
Daly believes that, unfortuna-
tely, in the past the confir
deniialityﬂfmany intera ctions
was neglected: She feels that
the importance 'of‘the confi-
dential trust which exists can<
not be underplayed. }_ St

During the last four weedts
Mrs. Daly has been meeting
with students, old and new, in
an attempt to define heme
tual functionas Assistant Dean
of Student Affairs at Grinnell.
In the process shehasprobab-
ly come in contact with most
Grinnellians whether they
have met her at the Forum,
in the meal lines, at a party,
at one of the discussion
groups, or justwalkingaround
campus.

September 24, 1971

One very importam discus*
sion group in which Mrs. Daly
is a participant is discussing
loneliness. Last Saturday
night, from 12:00 to 2:00, a
mixed group held a discussion
on loneliness in Cowles Hall.
This "joining of islands" was
deemed such a success that
another one has been scheda
uled for tomorrow night, Sep—
tember 26th, in Mears lounge
from 12:00 to 2:00.

Mrs. Daly is also involved
in the Career CounselingSer-
vice. Thursday, September
30th, a vocational guidance
test will be administered on
a voluntary basis. All Stir
dents who participate in this
will have individual meetings
with a member of the Career
Counseling Service to discuss
their test results.

In addition to this important
role, the Career Service will
be holding meetings for inst-
ructing students, on“ how one
should fill out employmentap-
plitxations. Mrs. Daly ex-
plained that many students
just don't know the properway
to fill out job applications,
and as a result of their in‘
ability to have each wordpre-
cisely in the right position,
they lose out on their sala-
ries. Often students are un-
aware of the differences this
sort of thing can make, even
though thousands of dollars a
year can be at stake.

In addition to this, believe it
or not, Mrs. Dalyhas had time
to give lectures on the Ameri-
can Indians, sit in on women’s
group meetings, and deal with
crisis situations. As Assist-
ant Dean of Student Affairs,
Mrs. Daly does act in the
capacity of a counselor. And
in the past few Weeks she has
confidentially dealt with many
situations.

Constantly innovating new
ideas, Mrs. Daly has 'proved
herself a remarkably surprisr
ing addition to Grinnell. As
she candidly admitted, “I just
keep on doing things no one
has ever done before."

Community Day Plans Almost Complete

Project plans are being come
pleted for Grinnell's Com-
munity Day to be held on

munity together in a day of
work toward a common pur-
pose. Chairman of the Come
munity Planning Council is

The proposal was adopted.

Students will probably be al-

The discussion turned to an
informal Chat about final at

that some of the old rigor in
this area is missing.

Spring Recess
At the next meeting the fan
culty will debate a motion by
Mr. Gale to begin the spring
recess after Friday classes
rather than at noon Saturday.
Since the attendence rule was
abolished three years ago,
the population of Saturday
classes immediately before
this vacation period has her
come increasingly sparse,
With some teachers not even
meeting classes on that day.

called at this point that there
was a proposal last year to
abolish Saturday classes ale
together; they asked what had
become of it. Dean Wall as-
sured them that it would be
considered this year. but emr
phasized that it was too late
to make such a far-reaching
change in class schedules for
this year at the time the
proposal was made last year.

Guroff

Mr. Guroff proposed that the
faculty adopt certain of the
procedures which had been
approved last year as amend-
ments to the faculty reorga—
nization proposal, before the
entire proposal was voted
down at the end of the year.
Among these were rules which
would require the chairman
of the faculty to preside at
faculty meetings and charge
a faculty committee to make
salary recommendations to
the administration, informing
department chairmen whatthe
substance ofthe recommenda-
tions was when they were
sent to theadministration. His
motion was tabled and will be
discussed at the next faculty
meeting.

Perhaps the mostnoteworthy
aspect of Monday's meeting
was its length-only 45 min
nutes. Such aberrations sho-
uld not go unnoticed.
