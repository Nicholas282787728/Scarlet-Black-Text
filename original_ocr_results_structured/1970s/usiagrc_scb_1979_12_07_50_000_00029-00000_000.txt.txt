Commends student efforts

To the editor: After many hours
tread not too many hours) of mental
anguish and much persuasion by a
certain friend of mine, I have deCided
to express a iew thoughts on recent
and not too recent editorials To be
sure, this is nothing more than
another one of those biased things, I
ieel, however, that something should
be said on the arguments concerning
the B525 and other such student in-
itiated projects.

Much has been said for and against
the 3&5. it is obnoxious, worthless,
paper using junk and , onthe other
hand, it is a viable, alternative outlet
[or student opinion. The‘controversy
has been going on for months now and
I doubt it it will ever stop. , .

The arguments themselves do not
concern me as much as the idea that
this sort of stuff is silly and should not
be tolerated. I have to agree that
some of the Bits is bad, but does this
mean that the people who spend time
on it should give up something they
really enjoy doing?

About We years ago a quasi-
socialistanarchist newspaper, The
Gadfly, came out and the articles
were outrageous. i could not believe
that anyone really meant a word of it,
it was badly written and printed, had
worse editing, and came out even
more sporadically than the BﬂtS. But

To the editor: A few comments by

Bill Stowe in the article on the Grins
nell College Democrats were
somewhat disturbing Nst off, he is
critical of the fact that the Republican
party represents an “American-
ideology what would he prefer, s
Korean ideology? if he means to say
that the Republican party sees things
from an American perspective, and is
concerned with the betterment oi her
people, he is correct. But I would be
curious to hear a Democrat say that
his party operates diiierently.
Perhaps it is just an inablility on my
part to pierce his rhetoric, but his
statement that Republicans are con
cerned with America first. rather than
the American people iirst, again has
me confused. I have always believed
that timeworn adage, “the American
people are America " i suspect that
Mr. Stowe is clumsily implying that
Republicans are wickedly interested
in international political power at the
expense of the average American. if

so, he is ignorant of the goals of the
Republican party Upon investigation,

he would discover that these goals are
very nearly the same as those of his
own party, though Republicans see
wholly disparate avenues for the
realization oi the goals

believed in it. They wanted to convey
their own ideas to the college com
munity,

Now we have the 88:5. And they are
not the only creative instigators this
year: The Dentists, the Summation
Gallery, student plays (some being
very strange), bringing Kennedy to
campus, The Nebutalls, the magazine
iormat oi the sea, and the Cambodian
campaign are all‘ the work of others.
All of these were brought about by
students having enough incentive to
try something new, Not everything
may be up to the standards of some
students, but that does not make ideas
worthless.

We can do better

To the editor: 1 have talked to a
number of people on campus who

think that the 3&5 is not a good paper.

1 was, like most people on campus. all
for the new paper when it seemed that
the group surting it was poor, picked-
on, and deprived of the innate rights
of American citizens, ”Yes,” we all
said, “support the 8&5. They have
rights, tool " The idea oi an
underground newspaper is exciting
and romantically appealing. But
somehow, among all the scuttle and
scurry something crucial was left out.
Maybe it was care or eiiort. Once the

ty “ideologically blind." Thisiafter
he has been slinging all sorts of mud
at Republicans and Joan Altemus has
attempted in the previous article to
make the Republican party more
palatable to the campus community
out of fear of being called a fascist.
There is actually nothing so perr
vasive at Grinnell as blind liberalism
Liberalism is “pop” lntellectuallsm.
And like other things in style, it is all
too oiten adopted not tor its merits but
because it makes a person reel “in or
socially acceptable, or, in this case,
“enlightened.” There is an overriding
sentiment on campus that no
reasonable intellectual arguments eXr
ist for conservatism. This situation 9X7

to the editor

Grinnell College affords an oppor»
tunity that will never come again.
Students can pretty much put their
words into actions. There is nothing to
stop them, unlike posterinneli, These
are the [our years after daddy and
mommy and before the real world.
Some students may not do as well as
others, but at least they are trying.
Nobody is asking anybody to accept
the 38:5 or some other student
organized “cause." Just allow
students to pursue their own interests.
This is their chance, so let us stop
fighting about harmless publications
and start worrying about real pro-
blems like finals, David Kramer
