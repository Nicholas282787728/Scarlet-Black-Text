Swimmers host Knox today

by naveSchochter

A heavy weekend of swimming
for both the men’s and women’s
teams starts today, though only
one of the meets will be at home.
That is this afternoon’s men’s
clash with Conference rival Knox
at the PEC, Tomorrow the men
compete in the Rockford (111,)
College Relays,

Meanwhile, as you read this
Coach Mike Daley’s women
tankers are facing the University
of Chicago and Chicago State
University in a triangular meet at
the latter school. Augustana plays
host to the Pioneer women
tomorrow for a dual meet.

Though dual meets do not count
for the Midwest Conference title,
this afternoon’s meet with the
Siwash from Galesburg, Ill. can be
seen as a showdown for the Con-
ference meet Swimming World
magazine has picked Knox for first
in conference and Grinnell for
second. Two weeks ago however
Grinnell outpointed Knox to take
third in the annual Grinnell Relays
Invitational, which was won by
Rockford with Augustana taking
second

Knox features two multiple
winners from last year’s cons
Ierence meet in Steve Varick and
Mike Muro Grinnell counters with
co-captain Bob Winters, a triple
winner last year. Fellow captain
Tom Rowat. Doug Johnson, and
John Chambers form the base of a
Pioneer swim crew that last week
polished off three opponents in
multiple dual meets held at Iowa
City. Chambers, Winters, and Al
Btesh all won races as Grinnell
defeated Ripon, Lawrence, and
Coe without trouble. Winters won
his specialties, the 200 Individual
Medley and the 200 backstroke;
Chambers grabbed the 200 but
tel'fly, and Btcsh won the so
freestyle. The Pioneers also took
the 400 year medley relay in that
meet.

Chambers was perhaps the
hardest worker of all during the
two weeks during break when the
Pioneers came back early for
practice. His times of 1:594 in the
200 free and 2:14,7in the 200 fly last
week were best times for the
sophomore. Two other much im-
proved swimmers alter break have
been freshman distance freestyler
Bob Nourse and freshman
breastroker Al Six.

Ilatimcr Cup

As playoff time approaches,
each team will be sharpening its
skills and driving itself into a
mental fever, for one reason: the
coveted Latimer Cup, long sym-
bolic of IM excellence. Right now
the cup is on display at the PEG.
The hours it can be viewed by the
masses are dependent upon how
often the janitnrs have to use it to
wash those unmentionalbe places
located in the bowels of the
Complex, but generally it is
available to see and admire.

A year ago Grinnell finished 4716 '
overall, and only 1-13 in Midwest
Conference play. When the regular
season began in early January the
team sported a 4-2 record, included
a clean sweep in the Chicago

'hloliday Tournament over
Christmas break. After that, the
team managed only one win.

The 197445 season has been a
different story altogether, After a
slow start at the Tipsoff Tours
nament and collapse in the Holiday
Tournament, just when the
situation looked grimmest for
Mitchell’s sound, things began to
gell.

After losing a tough bout to Lake
Forest 6657 January 17 at Grins
nell, the Pioneers rallied the next
day for a Darby Gymnasium win
over Lawrence 53-63. The 30-point
margin of victory was the largest
Grinnell win edge in over a decade,

Coach Mitchell was ecstatic
after the Lawrence game, calling it
“a very satisfying victory." He
added that he hoped “our men
learned that they can run a
disciplined offense and score in the
ROS and 905.”

Despite Friday's loss to third
place Ripon, it seems clear that the
Pioneers have indeed discovered
the key to an ordered attack. One
veteran performer said early in the
week, “We‘re finally doing what
Coach Mitchell wants us to do; that
is, having patience and working for
the higher percentage shot,”

One major change instituted
after the squad’s dismal showing
atthe Holiday Tourney was a three
guard system, keyed by a
playmaking backcourt man.
Senior Bruce Johnson, used only
sparingly during the exhibition
season in the fall, has filled this
position admirably. His work,
along with l-laigh and Zippe on the
outside has worked well in setting
up the inside scoring threat of
Bailey.

previous seasons is the team at
titude. Torn by dissension and
highly publicized quarrels and
quitting incidents in the past, the
squad this year has pulled together
in spirit.

“Right now I’d say we’ve got the
best team cooperation I’ve seen in
four years at Grinnell," remarked
senior guard Johnson. “People are
complimenting you after good
plays.” He attributed this to
Mitchell’s attitude-building effort.

Heading into the crucial
weekend beginning tonight, the
situation is good. The Pioneers
appear to have a shot at breaking
into the first division for the first
time since the trick was turned in
1963-64, when the squad managed a

This evening it’s the conference's

Grinnell‘s women’s volleyball
team ended its 1974 season with
wins over rivals Coei11715,15-8,15-
10) and Central (1015, 15-3, 15-11)
colleges.

Donna Meek. volleyball coach,
looked back positively on the fall
Season. “I think we did a lot of
successful building, We ended up
being a successful team."

As for next year's outlook, Meck
observed, “Since there won’t be
many people who graduated, we'll.
be starting out with a much more
experienced team. “If," she ads
ded, “the people who felt the
success at the end of this season
come back next year, hopefully
putting in a little more work, we
ought to have a very strong team,"

Coping with forceful serves and
practicing spiking techniques are
goals for next year. Competition
will be pretty much the same:
close games are expected with
Simpson, Upper Iowa, Coe, Central
and Mount Mercy.
