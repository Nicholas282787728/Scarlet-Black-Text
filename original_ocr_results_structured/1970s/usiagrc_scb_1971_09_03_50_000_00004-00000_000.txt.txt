Our Policy

This year the SCARLET AND BLACK hopes to provide come
prehensive coverage of campus neWs and an open forum tor
ideas and comment from all members of the community.
The editors will strive throughout the year to focus the
newspaper on meeting these simple, but fundamental, goals.

"News," of course, is what a newspaper should be about.
But there are different kinds of neWs and different ways of
reporting it; the particular kind of news which is sought
and the way it is pursued and written are what form the
character of a newspaper. To a large extent, the news policy
of the 5&8 will necessarily be determined by the editors,
but it is essential, if the 3&8 is to beapaper which will
inform and stimulate its readers, that other students both
offer their suggestions and actively participate in its pub‘
lication.

information on the significant activities of the various
groups and individuals at Grinnell College is the basic
priority the editors have set for the paper. Anew, sys-
tematic survey of this type of news through "beat" report
ters will be developed; such a system, which has not been
employed by the 8&8 in recent years, can be extremely
helpful to all members of the college community who have
too often been uninformed or informed too late for the actions
or decisions or proposals were already irrevocable.

Welleinformed criticism and comment on afﬁirs of both
local and wider importance is the second area of the news-
paper which will be given top priority throughout the year.
Information is useless unless it is thought about and unless
that thought is applied to life; the 88:8 editors and staff can
and will work to begin this process of thinking about news
and suggesting courses of action through columns and articles
of news analysis.

Obviously, news and comment are worthless if they are not
accurate. Therefore, the SCARLET AND BLACK will tire-
lessly work to checktheaccuracy ofevery story which appears.
To reach this and other goals, the 5&8 will needa little help

from a lot of people.

 

Good Cheap Rum At Argonne!

by Andy Kramer

The Lanternbar, Diana’s Gr»
eeki restaura‘nt,“Rush 'Street
in'ichicago'ﬁ rum l for $3.1‘9’
a fifth 7 these are just a few
of the brilliant discoveries
four Grinnell researchers
have made this summer while
studying at Argonne National
Laboratory in Illinois. Tom
De8artolo, Steve Ward, Andy
Kramer, and Marty Wice have
joined with nine other Asso-
ciated Colleges of the Mid-
west (ACM) Students for a
semester introduction intothe
nebulous world of scientific
research at the Atomic Ene
ergy Commission funded lab.
Joining them are three ACM
faculty advisers who serve as
counselors for the students:
Phil Bays (Grinnell),l(arl Ree
inhardt (Lawrence) and Char»
les Skov (Monmouth).

Each student hasbeenwork»
ing since July on an indivir
dually tailored researchprot
ject in one of the areas of
biology, chemistry, orphysics
under the direction of an Are
gonne scientist. The student’s
work, which willhopefully cul»
minate in publishable papers,
continues until mierecemr
ber. Independence will be the
outstanding feature of their
Argonne experience. It has
already expressed itself in
the student's studies and even
mode of living -- without bee
nefit of Saga or mother, the
independent provisioning of
food was the first subject of
research, and it was closely
followed by the study of malt
nutrition.

As witty and contrived as
that seems, food and malnur
trition, along with a host of
other environmentalproblems
corollary to population grow-
th, were actually subjects of
study in an interdisciplinary
seminar whichattends the stu-
dents’ Argonne program.

The weekly ID seminar tr-
eatises, presented whenever
possible by Argonne authorir
ties, on the huge topic of pop«
ulation‘stand in sharp con-
trast to the student's narrow
disciplinary work.

The scientists speaking at
[D seminars, the sophistir
called and modern instru'
ments, the scientific enter
prise, along with the rest of
the Argonne environmentproV
vide asig-nificant portionofthe
Argonne experience, but the
heart of the student's learn
ing is his disciplinary work.
Tom DeBartolo has had the
priviledge of working with two
important Argonne residents
in chemistry, Ashbya r goss-
lppi and Eremothecium ash-
byii. These are two high
riboflavine biosynthesizing
yeast that Tom is trying to
grow in a deuterium medr
ium to get fully deuterated
riboﬂavine from them, which
in turn goes to Mr. Bays who
is studying the structure of
riboflavine - related compou-
nds. If it seems odd that Tom
will simply be making the spe-
cial riboflavine as his project
while Mr. Bays can be doing
what sounds like the rele
vant, involved work of SITUC’
ture analysis, etc., suffice it
to say that Tom's research is
challenging enough to occupy
the best of six months.

With respect to all this per-
tinence, Andy Kramer in the
biology division was promised
perhaps the most relevant pro-
ject. Andy took a project in
the nuclear magneticresonance
study of intramolecular rota-
tion in di and tripeptides, and
his advisor, in response to
Kramer‘s expected question
about relevance, returned that
Andy's work would cure warts,
stunted growth, the common
cold and make men more pot
tent. Needless to say Andy was
anxious to begin his work.

How This Colu'mn Came About

Hear me, oh Muse. Woe bee
tide me and my progeny un-
to three generations, for many
moons ago, in a moment of
weakness, I offered the editor
a column a week. Now, many
are my talents and virtues,
but writing, to say nothing
of journalism, is not among
them. But forsooth, 'The
Time' is upon us to produce
filler or be forsworn forever.

It is said that the History
Department has the most ma-
jors at Grinnell College, so
it behooves me to give you
the History of Chess (since
Chess is my topic). However,
1 am mm a History major,
and I refuse. As a Math ma-
jor I should give you a few
statistics: on the number of
chess players in the world,
the longest game, the short-
est, etc; but I don't have any
smtistics. I do know, however,
that, with the possible excepr
tion of the incomingfreshmen,
Chess Nuts at Grinnell are
a nearly extinct plant.

How To Save

An Endangered Species

Well, I can't make you like
Chess so I’m not going to
try. But if you already like
Chess as recreation, or are,
maybe, interested in it as a
cutthroat competitive sport,
or just don't know anything:
about it (there, that should
catch almost everybody), read
on. I’ll ask the questions and
supply the answers; that way
all the questions asked will
be answered. O.K.?

What is Chess? A highly
addictive game played for fun,
money, and propaganda pur-
poses all over the world. If
you don’t know how to play,
but want to find out, you may:

I) Watch this column for news

about free lessons.

2) Get a beginner's Chess
book, preferably by either
I. A. Horowitz or Fred
Rienfeld.

Is there any organized Chess
at Grinnell? Precious little.
my friends, precious little.
But there were, and doubtless
shall be again. informal meer
tings once a week where e-
verybody who wants to come
and play can (and may). Last
year there was a first an-
nual Grinnell rated tournar
ment. This year, God wil-
ling, there may be a second.

What is a rating? Glad you
asked that. The United States
Chess Federation (USCFlpube
lishes a list several times
a year of its members and
their ratings. Supposedly a
rating is a measure of your
expertise at the game. If you
lose a rated-game your rating
goes down; win, it goes up.
The amount your rating chane
ges depends on how muchyour
opponent is better or worse
than you are (as determined
by his rating). There is a
complicated formula for de—
termining ratings. As a mat'
ter of fact, there are several.
The USCF changesits formula
on an average of three times
every five years. Fortunately,
you don't have to worry about
it; that's why the USCF char
rlzes a membership fee.

Who are the local addicts?
Arnold Adelberg (Profu
Math) Class B.

Don Aldrich Class A.

Jay Southard Class B

Bill Wilson

Mike Breed oops! Can’t find
Mike‘s rating, but its slight-
ly lower than mine.

“Power to the pawn pushersl

Dawn Of [die Risers

by Jack Dopplet

One of the more intriguing
ﬁncets of registration cont
corned the reasons students
picked their courses. Habitual
late-awakeners avoided eight
o'clocks and nine o'clocks and
various hangover freaks just
scanned the course sheet for
double digited period num-
bers. Time of day ranked in
priority only behind prof prer
ference, field of interest, and
a flip of the coin for those

freshmen unfortunate enough '

to enter Darby Gym slightly
ahead of BStG.

This consideration leads an
astute reporter to believe that
many students dislike waking
up early. To these members
of the AntirROoster Crowing
Society an unfortunate dilemna
arises. Because breakfast
hours are 7:1578:SU a.m.,
these weary masses arefaced
with either waking up hours
before their eyes or missing
breakfast. And Mrs. Schmitz,
a registerednurseatthe Grin-
nell College Infirmary warns
that "breakfast is the most
important meal of the day."
Saga has nothing to no will
the designated hours of meals
and actually is dissatisfied

with them. Saga serves break-

the

fast to approximately 400 stun
dents in an hour and fifteen
minutes and serves 1,000 stu*
dents lunch in an hour. This
may explain why you seem to
be on your feet a let at lunch-
time. The college sets meal
hours and because ofadvancer
ments in the role of student
decision making, change is
feasible if desired.

One possibility might be
adding a continental breakfast
to the present schedule. This
is a cafeteria style mealwhich
would offer anything that would
not require cooking and ser-
ving by Saga workers. For inn
stance, coffee, milk, juices,
doughnuts, rolls and cold C61
real would be available. It
would take a limited number
of workers to supervise. This
setup could last until 10:45
a.m. which wouldbenefitthose
with eleven o’clocks andthose
without morning classes.

This proposition has been
thrown about before. The cost
is minimal and might add
$5.00 on to totalcollege costs.
The remaining variable is
student support. A trial cone
tinental breakfast is being
planned for a Sunday in the
near future, so be awake.

Sllorp Snorf Finds Rock Book Flat

by Snarf

The Aesthetics of Rock (R. Meltzer, Something Else Press,
N.Y., 1970) is exemplary of the Quick Buck Rock Writer's
effort to pay his landlady. Meltzer fills 300 pages wid-l
(presumable) intimidating references to Aristotle, Pythagoras,
Sam the Sham, Bergson--you know, anybody who might come
up in a stone rap while listening to full volume Chuck Berry.
Unfortunately for us (but not for Mcltzer's creditors), the
best the man can do for us is gibberish like this:

“But in opposition to Aristotle's implicit criterion

of comparative relevance wherebyadventitious causes

would have to remain essentially irrelevant in order for

the truly relevant causes to be prominent and retain

their relevance, in rock the adventitious may be

the prominent, although still irrelevant." (p. 129)

If you can swallow that, try his methodology on for size:

“1 will probably embody this work with as much
incoherency, incongruity, and downright selftcontrac
diction as rock 'n’ roll itself, and this is good." (1.7.7)

Nimbly declining to give examples of rock’s ”downright
selfecontradiction, Meltzer goes on to ”justify" his methor
dology in the following way:

"The aesthetician, the philosopher of art, and the
art critic and never be epistemologimlly capable
of describing art by thinking at being, but must
think form and within being." (p. 7)

Well. Just to keep going, let's not ask precisely why the
aesthetician is "epistemologically" incapable of describing
art by “thinking at being", and just try to find out what
this fashionable sentence means. No easy task, but two
candidates are “prominent, if irrelevant”:
1) no objective evaluation of art IS possible.
2) no objective evaluation of art is possible except by
artists.
Very fine indeed. No. 1 makes Andy Warhol’s signature
as beautiful as the Beethoven Ninth; No. 2 is mere terrorism.
Camus writes somewhere that the most diverse artistic im‘
pulses share (at least one) ultimate goal: the creation ofa
sealed world. We don’t call sealed worlds "art" unless
they are organized upon discernible principles, because
western art has always been predominantly communicative
rather than merely expressive.
An example of Meltzer’s dominant critical device, the
Shyster Syllogism, can be found on pp. 1277131. Winding his
way through the Pocket Aristotle with gay abandon, he ulr
timately concludes that rock is indeed ”vulnerable to Arise
[Olelian analysis," even though he never says just what
”Aristotelian analysis" is; further in the course of three
pages he apparently forgets the only ”grid of analysis"
he has mentioned comes not from Aristotle but from Robert
s. Erumbaugh. (p. 127).
The trouble with a book like Meltzer's is that its anti-
logic cliches tend to obscure the good writing that does go
on in rock. A good example of competent rock writing (this
recommendation is aimed at poetry freaks on the faculty,
mainly) is Christagu's subtly argued repudiation of the ”Bob

Dylan Is A Great Poet" theory in The Age or Rock (I).
