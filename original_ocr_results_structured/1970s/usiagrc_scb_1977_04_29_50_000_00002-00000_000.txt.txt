Renovation of Clark?

Clark Hall will undergo extensive renovations second semester
next year if the trustees agree in their June meeting to fund the
recommendations of the Dober report. According to Susan Green
Crim. assistant dean of Student Affairs. if the trustees approve,
Clark Hall will be renovated ”as a pilot project” to enable the ad-
ministration to study the problems and costs involved in renovating
a dorm while college is in session. Crim points out that with such a
small workforce and the relatively short summer vacation, much
of the renovation by necessity will have to be completed during die
school year. ’

If plans are made for Clark to be renovated second semester next
year, students living in Clark will be relocated in other college
housing both on and off campus. Clark normally houses 44 students.

According to Crim, the relocation of students will be as fair and‘
equitable as possible. She said that attempts will be made to give
students housing “comparable to their situation in Clark,” and
that. “we will try to move floor members as a unit to new
locations.”

Amendments vote

A referendum on three SGA constitutional amendments will be
held this Wednesday at the post office. Under the first amendment,
any representative who misses one roll call vote for three cone
secutive Joint Board meetings or five meetings in one semester and
is not represented by their alternate is considered to have resigned.
New elections will be held to fill that Vacancy. This amendment
was passed last year in response to widespread absenteeism but
was never brought before a campus referendum,

The second amendment changes the term of office for all hall and
off-campus representatives and coordinators to one semester, New
elections would be held at the beginning of second semester. A
student could serve for an unlimited number of terms. The
amendment, narrowly passed by the Joint Board. is designed toi
make representatives and coordinators more responsive to their
halls and would provide freshmen and returning students a chance
to serve in these posts, Opponents claim that a large turnover
which could result from the elections would limit the effectiveness
of the Joint Board since newly elected people would have to take
several weeks to adjust to their new duties.

The third amendment grants the Judicial Council
final jurisdiction over violations of election guidelines and other
improper election conduct, The Council would also certify or throw
out the results of an election on the basis of the resolution of the
election violation charges.

Some may have hoped that last
week‘s temporary energy blackout
would serve to make students think
about how dependent we are on
electricity, and the need to can
serve it. Although it may take a
more serious crisis to shake most
Grinnell College students out of
their lackadaisical attitude
towards the energy waste, timers
overcame their lethargy far before
the blackout.

The Grinnell College students of
IFIRG (Iowa Public Interest
Research Group) conducted an
energy audit of eleven Grinnell
buildings this past winter. Ac
cording to their report, “energy is
being wasted at an alarming rate.”
Causes of waste were poor building

cent is allocated for food service,
The remainder of the budget is
spent on travel costs,
miscellaneous supplies and the
bookstore.

According to Walker, the college
is able to meet these costs. “The
college's financial situation is quite
strong. basically because of three
reasons. We’re not experiencing a
lot of trouble in admissions, and so
we can count on the 1100 or so
students we’re going to settle for
next year. It's quite strong for two
other reasons. We can get what we
need in unrestricted gifts, And the
third reason it’s quite strong is that
we've got a $34 million enr
dowment," he said.

Admissions are a critical factor
in meeting budget costs here
because student comprehensive
fees coverabout 60 to 65 per cent of
annual expenditures, According to
Director of Admissions John
Hopkins, Grinnell will receive
about 40 more applications this

insulation and weather stripping,
and poor operational practices,
such as over-heating and over-
illuminations.

Of the eleven buildings chosen at
random for the survey, Conn’s
TrueValue Hardware (331 Main)
received the best rating. Conn’s
had adopted 24 of 31 (77 per cent)

The lowest ratings were given to
Dr. J.C. DeMeulenaere's office
(1025 Broad) and the Grinnell City
Office Building (819 Broad). These
buildings received 41 per cent
ratings.

City Councilman Jim Miller said
that he had received several
comments from townspeople about
the low rating of the city office

Unrestricted gitts help to cover
much of the operating cost not
covered by student fees. Walker
said the college will try to obtain
$825,001) worth of such gifts, which
can be used for almost any ex»
pense, The Dean said that the
figure was a liberal estimate,
meaning that even if the college
does not receive $325,000 in
unrestricted gifts. it would still be
able to meet expenses.

Costs not met by comprehensive
fees and unrestricted gifts are
covered mainly by interest on
investment of endowment money
and by miscellaneous items such
as federal funds for financial
aid. Endowment interest, Walker
said, varies between rates of six to
ten per cent, depending on the
investment. He mentioned Data
Documents, AT&T, and TV station
WDTN in Dayton as some of the
college’s revenue producing in-
vastments,

As Walker noted, a key to
Grinnell’s solid financial situation
is its $34 million endowment.

building. Miller said that he thinks
energy conservation is a good idea,
but that people will have toot
convinced of the values of it before
they do it. ”That may take a little
arm-twisting," he said.

Jim Riddle, the author of the
IPIRG report, stressed that the
changes need to be made on the
individual level. “Energy con»
servation is an attainable goal—it
just takes a conscious effort. Our
study found that there is a direct
correlation between a person’s
interest in energy conservation
and in the action they take;
Grinnell College students can ﬂy
wasting energy in all areas, They
can turn off lights, save paper, and
quit wasting food in the dining

hall," As

Walker estimated that over the
past seven or eight years. the
college‘s endowment has grown
from $19 million to its present total.
He said the endowment is
unusually large [or a school of
Grinnell’s size.

Most of the endowment is tied up
in long term investments, meaning
the college must go to court to J":

most of which may be spent. A
smaller part of the endowment,
