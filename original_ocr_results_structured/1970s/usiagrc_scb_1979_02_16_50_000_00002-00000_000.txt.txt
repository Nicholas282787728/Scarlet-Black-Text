No clues in Forum robbery

by John Mandel

Little hope is given for the
recovery ofover $50 and a cash box
taken during a Forum iheit on
February 8, says Forum supervisr
or Jenny Erickson.

Desk attendant Gregg Edwards.
who was on duty from 4 to (5:30
p.m,, Said he locked the two desk
drawers at approximately (S pm, in
order to make his rounds of the
building and to straighten up South
Lounge after a meeting.

UPON RETURNING to the dcsk
shortly altcr 5:15 pm, Edwards
said he found the lock was not
pOSltioned on the two desk
drawers,

He then opened [he desk and
noticed the cash box was not in-
side. Edwards said he assumed he
had not locked the drawch until,
after looking around for (hc lock.
he lound part or it lying on the
floor,

BOTH TIIE Grinnell police and
Jenny Erickson, supervisor oi the
Forum were notified. The police,
Erickson said, could do very little
since neither Witnesses nor clues
cXisted, Fingerprints were not
taken due to the considerable
amount of handling the desk
receives,

Both Edwards and Erickson
conclude a bolt cutter was used to
cut the lock because of the smooth
cut found in the small piece
recovered.

EDWARDS SAYS he feels
“pretty sure that somebody was
watching me" and the theft or}
curred when he left the desk.

He said he believes the
crime had to be premeditated
because of the use of the bolt
cutter, though he said he saw
nobody in the building who looked

Grand Old Party

(continued from page It
Minnesota and Jim Thompson of
Illinois. But Edwards said he fears
the party might eventually
disintegrate because “it can'l
afford to lose at the presidential
level too long without feeling some
pain."

The future GOP strategy seems
to be aimed at the decentralization
notion. Michael Novak. in an or
title on the GOP‘s decline, called
for the party to pay attention to the
basxc “meditating institutions" of
society. These are the institutions
which serve, protect, and stand
between the individual and the
state, Novak said.

Novak said the GOP should go to
where the people work and live,
dealing with problems on the
iamily, union, church, and neighr
borhood levels He said the GOP
should be looking for “imaginative
social strategies to meet social
needs better than welfare
democracy does."

“strange." He says his departure
was “an idcal time to do something
like that” since very few students
use the building during that period
of the day,

Eiilt \‘ RECOUNTS a
similar situation occurred a few
years ago but only a minor amount
of money was taken and the desk
was unlocked at that time

She says now B&G has pmVlded
a new, thicker caserhardcned steel
bolt lock to replace the previous.
less secure lock. Both the cash box
and money had to hc replaced out
oi the Forum supplies budget.

THE ELIMINATION of handling
money at the desk was not

seriously considered, Erickson
says, because “we still have to

offer change to correct the situa-

tion so that it will not happen
again,"

Generally Erickson says she's
been impressed with the way
students have handled the building
and she says students are usually
well-behaved and respect the

Edwards said desk attendants
“sometimes have to be away from
the desk {or long periods of lime "
But now, he said, “We're going to
have to try to be away ior less
time." adding this type oi crime is
“almost impossible to prevent."
