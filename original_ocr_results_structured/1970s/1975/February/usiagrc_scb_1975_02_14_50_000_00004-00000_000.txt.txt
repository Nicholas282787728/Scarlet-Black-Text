The root of
the matter

School board decisions seem to have a singular capacity to
evoke community conﬂict for several reasons. Primary is the
value American society has attached to the idea of education
A feeling exists among parents that the best thing that they
can give their child is a "good” education

In a highly literate society, education is a common ex-

erience that is shared by the majority of the population We
have all gone to school, and in the process have developed
personal educational philosophies as to what comprises an
appropriate education.

The small town in Iowa, Grinnell, which so often has been
described in pastoral terms as a quiet farm community, is in
turmoil over the education of its children Unlike the war
protests of the 1960's, gown is not separating from town, but
the conﬂict is indigenous to the community.

It is centered on the “obscenity” of a number of books
used in the Grinnell-Newburg School Systemi Wednesday
the school board decided to allow the books which had been
considered up to that point to remain in use.

Rev. James Turner, a member of the reconsideration
board, recently wrote a letter to The Grim-tell Herald-
Register drawing lines demarcating “all you liberals, and
self-titled intellectuals” who ”actually think that (they) are
better, and better informed, than a garbage collector, store
clerk, or any non-professional and even some professional
men, V‘éhD disapprove of the school books their children have
to rea ."

It is questionable whether the lines drawn by Rev. Turner
have the clarity and exclusiveness that he suggests. They are
more correctly mere brush strokes in a picture of confusion.

Both sides have stumbled over, grappled with, and been
confronted with a definition of a moral education Ben See,
who initially filed the complaints against the books, has
repeatedly stated his position that ”you can’t legislate
morality, morality comes from within the individua .”
Meanwhile Robert Sheeder, another member of the recon-
sideration board, stated, ”I cannot be a surrogate for the
community", asking, “Who should be the arbiter for
community standards?"

Then again, Mr. See has claimed “God has been taken out
of the school.” It is questionable whether the removal of a
few books would return His presence.

Despite the confusion, the presence of a few off-color
phrases in some popular novels has aggravated fractures
that cut well below the comparatively semantic issue of
“obscenity”. Given the small size of Grinnell, the pain from
such fractures is not easily absorbed, and may test the
endurance of its inhabitants in the future

Finally, one must empathize with the futility and
frustration of parents, regardless of their orientation on the
issueinplarents who desire to teach their children well. How i

To the Editor:

I would like to invite all mem-
bers of the campus community to
participate in the upcoming Latin
American Week, to be held
February is through February 22.
I think this will be an excellent
opportunity for all students to get
to know another culture since,
outside of the off campus study
programs, Grinnell does not offer
much personal contact with other
ways at life.

Personally, my four years at
Grinnell as a ioreign student have
been very satisfying. Not only have
I gotten a liberal arts education.
but I have learned the value of
understanding a culture different
from my own. Getting to know
about North America has been as
rewarding as expanding my
academic knowledge.

i am happy to be involved in
providing the opportunity for the
campus community to get to know
about Latin American culture. 1
hope that Grinnellians will find it
as valuable as [have to understand
another culture.

Who’s
wearing
jeans?

To the Editor:

Back when l was in Hale Cook
Elementary School, there was a
cute little game we used to play. It
didn't have a name, but it was
somethinglike St. Patrick‘s Day. If
you were green or yellow on
Thursday you were a queer. So we
were all very careful not to wear
anything with green or yellow in it
on Thursdays. Of course some poor
guy would forget about “Queer's
Day" almost every week and then
he‘d have to be queer for a whole
day.

l was naturally delighted to see
this neat game has not been
forgotten here in Grinnell, The
rules are a little different now. and
the day’s been switched to Friday,
but What the heck! It’s Still a lot of
ion. Any of you guys in blue jeans
go to Hale Cook?

TO the Editor:

We were astonished and
dismayed to discover the low
regard held for the drinking
propensities and abilities of the
senior class by those who planned
the “One Hundred Days" party.
Even though we enjoyed ourselves
at the party (thanks in great
measure to friends and a case of
imported beer), we feel compelled
to express our hope that in the
future eager partygoers will not
have to wait in a soberingl
(ma be not a word, but you shoul
get he point) long line only to be
rewarded with a small cup of
unsatisfying foam.

In the other words, it is un-
fortunate that the planners of the
"One Hundred Days” party failed
to have the foresight to see that one
loampmne beer dispenser would
not be sufficient to accommodate a
horde of dehydrated seniors.

in good spirits,

An open Letter to Gay Lib:
Folks,

My hats off to you! Never in all
my years here have I seen such a
brilliant coupl Really and truly,
like I do mean it. You
mimeographed mat little thing and
zipped it into people's boxes and
goddamn it, see the Neanderthals
run. I do believe that several jocks
have died of apoplexy for lack oi

Why it was even better than the
stinkbomb bit, although not much
more original. You must be a
bunch of really fun guys, on I’m
sorry, Gays (other people have a
sense ofhumor, too). I can't wait to
see all the chickies running around
in the snow in their little frockie-

having your little notice iramed.
Goddamnit you’re funny. i love you

Manager are now accepting an»
plications for the position of full-
time manager of the Pub,

First, perhaps we should explain
our rationale for creating a'non-
student, full-time position as op-
posed to the part-time student
manager arrangement. We feel
that we are asking for a person who
will he devoting more time to the
position than a student normally
would for any extracurricular
activity. That is not to say that this
job is comparable to participating
or heading a committee or being
involved with a sport or produc-
tion. Rather, we have separated
the job from academics and other
related aspects of the college and
are now appealing to those people
who feel they would like to accept
this sort of challenge in the form
of a fulHime position.

responsible for any social activity
held with the Pub. In the past, we
have had a social chairman, but
we have now considered that since
this is a full~time position, the
person would have the time to plan
and organize such activities and
delegate responsibilities to assist
with this area of the job.

Again. let us remind you that we
are looking for someone who is not
enrolled full-time at Grinnell.
Seniors without immediate plans
or persons considering leaves of
absence might be particularly
interested in the opportunity to
remain in Grinnell with a well-
paying position on campus. The
hours are reasonable. Since the
Pub has opened, the business hours
have been 4 pm, to 2 am. The
operation of the Pub extends from
New Student Days until graduation
with Christmas and spring break

Generally speaking, the job
requires that the person run the
Pub on a day-today basis. being
responsible [or all stock to sell,
personnel (including being
responsible for the attitudes and
actions of the employees) and for
maintaining the clean, well-lighted
atmosphere of the Pub as set up in
the planning stages of the cor-
poration. Other specific issues that
come up would also be dealt with
by this person, including monthly
statements, repairs, etc. However,
the present manager has said that
these thingsand others are likely to
happen only so often, dependent on
clientele and other such factors.
Continually meeting with and
serving the members of the Pub
will perhaps be the most
challenging, rewarding and en
ioyable aspect of this job.

The job also includes being

off. The pay is negotiable and will
be discussed in the interviews with
the Board,

We are expecting applicants to
present a full resume’ with
previous experience and any
related information in the field of
management. Please submit these
applications to my Po. Box 1103
by Feb. 23. After the applications
have been received and reviewed
by the Board, a series of interviews
will be conducted by the Board and
Managerfl‘hrough these we hope to
screen and find a person who is
both Willing and able to assume the
position

it you have any questions please
feel free to Contact: Mark Nissen,
mgr.; Alice Bernstein; John
Hafkemeyer; Thomas McBee;
Maurice Hunt; Richard Vos or
myself.
