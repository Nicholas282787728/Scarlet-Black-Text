was expected to be a close game
Into an easy Siwdsher victory, The
teams entered tile contest iiilh
identical records and similar
statistics, “it should have been a
one or two point game," Griiinell
Assistant Coach Ron Mitchell said.

The Siwashers and Pioneers had
similar incentives to prepare
mentally ior the game Both
needed a victory to tinish in the
conlcrence upper division and it
was the final game of the careers
of many seniors on both squads.
Knox also had \\halever advantage

Siwashers a quick 7-0 lead
Grinnell tied it a few minutes later.
Quarterback Paul Crane hit his
most often-used receiver, Paul
Delaney. with a long pass into
Knox territory. Delaney was
shaken up and had to leave the
game, His replacement, Phil

After six years of losing, this
year’s wrestling team looks very
promising. Maurice Hunt, coach
all six years, has seen his pioneers
suffer an overall record of 2-70-1
For most of these years. the coach
didn’t have enough wrestlers to
represent all the weight classes,
These were the years that Grinnell
couldn't have won a meet even if
all our wrestlers had won their
matches.

Like most of the varsity sports at
Gl‘lnnell, this year's wrestling
team will be centered around the
freshmen candidates. Twenty—one
people are trying out ior the
current squad, and only four oi
these are returning lettermen:
junior captain Hosea Engram
tum, seniors John Doughtery
(126) and Dan Mosby (158), and
sophomore Bo deRosa (190).

Ten ol the grapplers are fresh-
me Glenton Davis, David
Greenwald, Tom Hawbaker, Ken
Johnson, Peter Kol‘nbaker, Chris
Ladd, Loren Rice, Cornell Rudov.
Larry Shankman, and Gordon
Stacey, Coach Hunt. believes that it
is likely that these freshmen will
fill in the vacancies, however, it is

possible that some of the
newcoming upperclassmen will
win a spot. These upperclassmen
are senior Bill Hahne, juniors Will
Collins, John Hamby, Byung Kim,
and Craig Nelson. and sophomores
Rick Grayson and Ed Hassey.

This year’s team is impressing
the coach in many different ways
First oi all, the squad has a lot oi
novices ivho look extremely
promising. This pleases Hunt
because, ior the iirst time in many
years, he can apply his coaching
skills to a large group of talented
athletes.

Secondly, this year’s team has
depth; this is an advantage since
all the wrestlers will have to
compete tor a position on the team.
Finally, the team excites Hunt with
its youthful enthusiasm and
energy. The coach ieels that this
year's team has as much drive as
any other group that he has
coached at Grinnell.

Because the wrestling squad has
so many impressive qualities,
Coach Hunt speculates on a win

Tankers dive into action

by Dave Schcchter

A large group oi ireshmen will
combine with seven returning
conference meet veterans in
iorming the base ior this year’s
men’s swim team. Grinnell faces
its tirst competition oi the season
in the Iowa College Relays,
tomorrow at Iowa State University
in Ames.

Coach Ray ooermiller is hoping
that this team will be strongi
enough to turn the tables on Knox
and win the Midwest Conlercnce‘
title, which Grinne;l lost by 17
points last year. However,
Obermiller is thinking of
tomorrow's meet' as his '.tirst
chance to‘see the tetim in ‘comv

petition and to get some idea oi the
squads current strength.

Team captains Doug Johnson
and John Chambers, both juniors,
return to lead this year’s team. The
multi-talented Chambers holds
three school records while Johnson
holds one. One other school record
holder returning is sophomore
breaststroker Greg Olson. The
remaining returnees irom last
year‘s conference meet squad are
breatstroker Al Six, diver Joe
Wambach, and ireestylers Bob
Nourse and Steve Miller,

This year‘s ireshmen contingent
will go far in horing up holes left
by the graduation of tour members

’»of last year‘s :iquad, including

captains Bob Winters and Tom
Rowat. Obermiller sees promise in
Bruce Jones, Chris Carton, Bert
Simpson, Frank Halley, Bill
Raynolds. John Roberts, Bruce
Mureh, Norm Zimmerman, and
Mark Shima. li this appears to be a
long list of new swimmers, it is and
it. is one reason that Obermiller is
looking iorward to a successiul
season. Other returning veterans
include Ireestylers Kent Ramsey,
Dave Schechter, and Randy Crai .

Home partisans will get their
first look at the tankers on
November 24 and 25 as the

Women win
and lose

by Rich Arnold

The WorVo's iinished the!
season Tuesday With home my"
and junior varsity tilts agains
Central College out oi Pella.
Central edged the Varsity in two
close games 15712, 15713, but ii£
JV, showing promise ior .
future, won both games in their
match 1316, 15713.

Coach Donna Meek tested a new
strategy in the games both on
oiiense and deiense. 0n otiense,
spiking was practically abandoned
in layer oi returning the ball by the
second hit. Too many times the
women had been called ior illegal
sets and those points lost proved
costly. Very few times did the
women set the ball for spikes in
Tuesday’s games.

on deiense, the women changed
their positioning on the court so
they would be in more propit= ~s
places to return opponents shoi
While the changes were not as
successiul as hoped, the deiense
was markedly improved over past
periormanccs,

An unfortunate event in ti,
Varsity match was that the
Pioneers jumped out to leads in
both games and were unable to
hold them both times.

The JV games were marked by
solid teamwork and steady ser-
ving, If the bulk of these players
return, the nucleus ior next ,
year's squad wilrbe secure, as
