coking back at Grinnell’s history,
however, we find that this
liberality somehow stemlned from
a rather conservative, Christian
background. Although Grinnell is
known for contemporaneous
thinking, this does not exclude the
possibility oi a continuing
Christian commitment for some
embers of the campus com-
munity, such as those involved in
the Christian Fellowship
organization.

Members recently emerged irom

Vienna earlier this year. They are
the only surviving masters of their

other up in love and faith."

Even more important to the lives
of Christian Fellowship members
are small group prayer meetings.
Six groups, with ten to twelve 11']
each. meet on a regularly
scheduled basis with extra sessions
held when the need for such is felt.
Sixty people active in such
meetings are led by twelve small
group leaders. Other members,
such as the team organizers, meet
each day ior prayer, sometimes
twice daily.

To those not involved, Such
meetings may bring to mind a
“Jesus Freak” image or an old
style, rolling-on-therfloor, chanting
type oi session with personal
conversion experiences related

amidst subs and tears. This Is not
the Conception which these people
have at themselves or that they
wish others to have oi them. They
see themselves as simply a group
whose basis [or lite is the Christian
community. Their eommittment IS
radical, but in the sense oi
thoroughness. not oi extremeness,

Organized “because oi a need to
extend the Christian community to
campus," this year's group is
young in terms or ideas and age oi
the members. The four main
leaders, two sophomores, two
juniors. lead a group basically
composed or ireshmen and
sophomores. But, it anything. they
see this youngness as a positive
iactor, a real help in their con-
tinuing campus ministry.

With vacation time fast approaching,
many of you will no doubt be traveling
to Mexico. Some of you might even be
coming back. Here are some helpful

hints.

1. A man on a burro always has the
right of way, unless he appears to be

a weakling,

2. In local cantinas, pouring a shot of
Cuervo down a man’s collar is not
thought to be humorous.

3. Falling onto a cactus, even an
actual Cuervo cactus, can be
a sticky proposition.

4, It is tough to find hamburger

rolls in the smaller

towns; it’s

best to bring your own.
