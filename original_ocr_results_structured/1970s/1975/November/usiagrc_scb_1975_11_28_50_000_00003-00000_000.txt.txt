3"Gay experience often lonely

To the Editor:

lam gay. i write this letter to thc
Grinnell community with the hope
that Gl'innellialls may be a little
more aware and understanding of
the gay people among them.

Last year, the “Gay Movement”

‘was one oi the big political issues
on campus. Unfortunately, it was
mostly a rhetorical campaign of a

, few outspokell individuals. and

acked personal reality and sub
'stance, While it did attract a few of
us (who came inostiy out oi
curiosity to iind out what the

. uproar was all about), the uplront,

, radical image oi the group
probably alienated many more of
us,

This year, the gay "movement"
and its rhetoric taside from
bathroom gratitti) are gone, bill
most of us remain. We will always
be here, The movement Came and
went, and left our lives essentially
unchanged,

1 know some oi the gay people

‘who are still “open” about their
sexuality, but i am hesitant to be
seen with them much. ii word got
around that I was gay, 1 would lose

treasured relationship with a

“woman, and my closest friend
would probably not speak to me.

I‘ve learned to censor my
thoughts and feelings, only letting

" be “acceptable," the “straight,"
he “masculine" be seen,
Sometimes I feel that I Sell my Soul
ior acceptance into a sick, in-
tolerantsociety. When I go out
drinking with friends, for instance,
someone invariably makes a
“faggot" joke, for a derogatory

comment. it i ever objected, they
might begin to question my
identity, so I usually laugh along
with them, trying not to hate
tmyselftor doing it. I wonder if they
will ever understand the profound

{feet of their careless comments.

When i think that around a per
cent oi the total adult population is

predominantly homosexual, I am
amazed that there can be so many
others with these same hidden
feelings, while such attitudes still
go unchallengcdﬁves, even at
Grinnell.

i come irom a large Eastern
city, and when I am home, one
casionally I manage to escape tor a
night to a gay bar But I always
have to lie about where i am going,
and I end up having a miserable
time hecuase I live with the cons
stant dread that my parcnts will
somehow find out, I couldn't face
that. nor could they.

And it I ever found another man
whom I loved, here at Grinnell or
at home, how could we ever see
each other with any peace oi mind?

Would I give him up and live in
lonellliess, or could we face the
jokes, the ridicule, the rejection,
the hatred" Which would be more
tolerable7

I guess i chose to write to
compensate iormy lack of courage
here on campus But somehow it is
hard to reel any strong conviction
when there are so few other ad-
mitted gays around, and when i
stand to lose close friends, Finally,
I can’t help but feel a little anger
No matter how hypocritical or
gullty ! may be for pretending to be
something i am not, part oi the
blame 'lllust rest on those who
continually tell me that what I am
is unacceptable—Name Withheld

Suggests courses

To the Editor:

Grinnell certainly is iortunate to
receive a $200,000 grant from the
Mellon ioundation, but to make the

most of this grant I believe we-

should apportion the money to
specific academic pursuits. For
example, instead of otfering an
amorphous course titled
“Women‘s Studies" offer “Women
in Art: Music, Drama and Art.” 0r
instead of “International Studies"
offer “Euopean political and
economic theory." The particular
course, of course. doesn't matter,
but I’m atraid a general course
would end up being a survey
course.

I do, however, have two course
suggestions. I feel that a course in
“Modern Literature and Drama
Since World War II” would be of
interest to many students. The
course could include such authors
as Pinter, Beckett, Barthcleme,

second class postage paid at Grinnell, la. soiiz
subscription sum per year
within Powesnlek county $6.541

Grinnell Collcge
Grinnell, Iowa

and examine the new literary
movements in Latin America and
West Africa.

Another course, “The Evolution
of the Novel” could begin with
Cervantes and Fielding, then study
Flaubert and Dostoevsky and
finish with Joyce and Mann. Not
only would the course be of ime
mense value to any student
majoring in a language, I’m sure it
would also attract anyone in
tcrested in the novel as a genre.

I must admit the final course
recommendation is not original
with me. but I'm passing it on
because I tee] it's an excellent
idea. In any case I hope the topics
that are iinally chosen by Mr.
Walker and Ms. Eysenbach are
speciiic and pertain to the general
interest or the majority oi the
Grinnell students.».lolili Chain»

Liberalism

means

open—mindedness

To the Editor:

The recent discussion on
liberalism has been, if not
enlightening, at least helpiul in
causrng us all to examine ourselves
more critically.

It is irrelevant to say Grinnell
students are or are not more
“liberally minded" than other
students. Besidesvbeing an obvious
generalization over too many kinds
of liberallst ideals (social.
political, women’s, etc ), it
requires a value judgment which
none oi us are capable oi honestly
making

Liberalism means open-
lnindedness: a constant conscious
cilort to challenge one's own
values in Search of better truer
ones. This position takes a lot of
time and energy to uphold, and
very few in history have actually
achieved it, It is much easier to
accept certain restrictions and
institutional frameworks and allow
them to make the decisions. Some
institutions are necessary. of
course, but they must be subjected
to constant surveillance and re-
hash.

Are we trying as hard as we can
to be as open-minded as we hope to

be? More often than not We get
caught up in the maze of getting
next week’s paper properly
researched and put off rethinking
our policies in all aspects of life.

Many may consider themselves
politically liberal, but these ideas
may well change aiter leaving the
intellectual haven of Grinnell and
being forced into the “hard
capitalist world " liopeiully the
ideas and thought processes
nurturcd here will carry over and
we won’t succumb blindly to the
prerestablished institutions of our
nation's politics,

Socially. things could be better.
It is easier to withdraw into our
own Comfortable world and claim
that others are incompatible
rather than to make the effort to
iind out it they really are.

Perhaps some do hide behind
their “liberallst” faces of jeans
and “natural” styles. If it provides
a false security, then it should be
abandoned, but if it helps them to
at least try to keep improving our
world by providing a visual con-
trast with other ideals, then
perhaps it is helpful—Suzi Farver

Present outside news

To the Editor:

Due to the fact that I am on the
Grinnell-in-London program, I am
not able to read the 554]} every
Friday aiternoon when it is
distributed to the rest at the
campus. it does not, however,
dampen my disgust at this
newspaper ior not taking a stand
on the recent vote by the United
Nations equating “Zionism with
racism.” it is not only my
emotional ties with the subject that
causes this disgust; it is the con-
stant policy ot the editors to ignore
national and international issues
that raises my ire. Back in the late
'60's and early in the '70’s the 5&3
was active criticizing the policies
oi the US. government and its

officials.

Iam not asking the paper to take
on my view oi the subject. All T am
asking is that the editorial board
recognize something that is
newsworthy to the campus.
something that is controversial
and worth taking the time to
comment on. The paper must not
be just a forum for football scores
and upcoming concerts and events,
It must take on issues and make
them important, stimulating the
sleeping and overworked brains of
students. it the paper cannot
periorm this purpose at least part
of the time, it will wind up in the
garbage cans of every student
without even causing a yawn or a
raised eyebro\v.—Bob Render
