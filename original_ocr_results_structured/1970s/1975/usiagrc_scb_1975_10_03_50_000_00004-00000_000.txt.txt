To the editor:
open letter to the New Time
Dear New Time.

While i realize that you had good
intentions, l iound the tone oi your
recent mailbox invitation highly
offensive. It reflects the “holicr
than thou" attitude or a great
number of “concerned liberals,” I
for one have lived in a “cabin in the
woods.” 1 know other people who
are doing so now, and I intend to
again. Does that mean that l (we),
unlike “those of us," don’t care
about war, racism and Sexism” I
assure you that I and my friends do
care about those things. What I
don't care ior, however, is your
attitude. ihave, and do now try to
deal with those things as best I Can,
in my own way

Of Course I realize ”that the
security of Grinnell doesn’t last
forever," but i will try to enjoy its
merits while it does. And I would
like to know what you mean when

you say, “and pretend ‘everythings
gonna work out all right.‘ ” ls
thinking that always pretending?
Do you always assume otherwise?
You get together in a group and
talk about social and political
issues: so what? Who doesn’t at
one time or another.

Do you think that you are the
only ones who “care" and are
“Irying to learn what's really
going down?" You are (I assume)
doing what you enjoy, Great! But
please don’t think‘that you are
somehow better than those people
who, for their own reasons, don't
feel like joining you (Myself in-
cluded)

In the past. I have worked for
Gene McCarthy, George
McGovern, and The American
Friends Service Committee

What is Mortar Board?
Technically an honorary society
for senior women, this year’s “Cap

the campus community than most
chapters in the recent past. (Last
year‘s chapter sponsored the
Women nerareers Conference.
Now do you remember the Mortar
Board?)

Members this year are Joanna
Axtmann, Debbie Bartling, Susan
Beise. Caryn Chaden, Christine
Davidson, Cindy Florin, Suzanne
Friedman, Hope Gayley, Adie
Goldberg, Marg Hedstrom, Judy
Hoffman, Susan l-lyatt, Mary
Laughlin. Judith Mason, Pam
Palmer, Beth Preiss, Alison
Rossle. Susan Sencer, Gail
Stewart, Deb sivackhamer, and
Lynn Voodisch, Bea Wall, lrene
Jones, and Dianne Ruyffelaere are
advisors.

An informal coffee hour for
women {acuity and administrators

Letters

Loneliness: Gift of time

To the Editor:
Open letter to Will Collins
Dear will,

I am compelled to respond to
your article concerning the
Grinnell students’ disproportionate
.. . . .dependance upon intellectual
facilities,” which is “ , i .
devastating to the individual and to
the community." We share many
of the same basic observations oi
liie ateGrinnell College, but differ
greatly in our interpretation or
these observations.

For example, many of the
students here did, indeed, handle
high school academics with
“agility," but not their social lives.
Remember being Called, “Brain !"
or “Teacher’s pet!” or numerous
other less complimentary names?
It is much more tempting to
retreat into a “tiny ivory lower”
when functioning in an enr
vironment which shuns academic
achievement. Upoll their arrival at
Grinnell, these academically
motivated students often discover
an acceptance of their academic
interests and pursuits which free
them to interact socially in a
comfortable, meaningiiil way for
the first time.

On to the paragraph in which you ,

state that Grinnellians lack the “

. spiritual, emotional, social, and
moral awareness that tempers
mere knowledge into wisdom , .”
Uh uh, l have never seen so many
people searching, questioning, and
sharing with others their emotions,
morals, and, yes, even spiritual
matters. You don’t see it in open
forums or panel discussions, but
rather late at night in somebody's

. room, or under a tree as two people

share a problem or disap-
pointment, and attempt to cope
with it. as best they can. Perhaps
what you see is wisdom in its
iormative stages. And I add, lack
oi wisdom is not unique to Grinnell
students. Look at th city ni
Grinnell, at Washington, DC,,
anywhere “out there;" they're just
as contuscd as we arc.

Social skills? You think that
most Grinneilians are lacking in
basic social skills that l: , . ,
members of a. less .intellcctually

'cr‘lcnlcd’communlty might have.” ‘

Those who by age eighteen have
not mastered their basic social
skills probably never will, and
many of those who have, choose to
throw them out the window for four
years because they desire an en-
vironment with fewer restraints on
social behavior. What evolves may
be chaotic, or it may be very
honest and open—but it is a form oi
experimentation that is healthy
and has no better time or place
than college.

As for loneliness, the college
experience is, by its very nature, a
lonely one, But is that necessarily
bad? It is just as easy to regard it
as precious time one has to oneself
after breaking ties with family and
before building new ties with
mates, etc. It is a time for stirring

up and settling down, again and,
again,
emotions inside of us.

Mortars: recruit women

To the Editor:
Open letter to Dean Walker
Dean Walker.

As members of Mortar Board,
the senior women’s honorary
organization on campus, we feel
that it is time to make a Statement
concerning the policies of hiring
iaculty, and why a special eiiort to
hire women faculty is necessary at
this time. We are writing now
because of the position to be filled
in the sociology department, and
later in the year in English and
psychology, but we believe that
this reters to general hiring
policies on campus,

Studies have been done (see
Elizabeth Tidball, 1973) showing
that “the number of female faculty
and the number of female
achievcrs were highly and
positively correlated, their
dependence was not a matter oi
chance” in comparison to the
number of women students at
Grinnell, [here is only a small
percentage of women in positions
of au lority, including iaculty and
admi istrators. Clearly this lack of
role “models" presents a problem

>_for‘ women-who are beginning to

make 'th’cir decisions about

careers, et
specifically, in departments like
sociology, where nearly 70 per cents
oi the majors are women (as of
November, 1974), this is especially
important,

"

Cetei‘a. More

We feel that this means that a

special effort must be made to,
recruit (and keep) women when

Minimally,
hiring should have copies oi
Grinnell's affirmative action plan,
and
openings should be made through
open channels so that they do not
automatically discriminat‘
