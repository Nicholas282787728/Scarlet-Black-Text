Inauguration

When A. Richard Turner is
inaugurated as the ninth president
ot the college on April 12, the
program oi events will be in a long
tradition. The eight inaugurations
that have occurred previously
have all had basically the same
iormat as this time. Although some
oi the inatlgurations have been
more iormal than others, all have
been similar.

in the twentieth century,
Grinneil has inaugurated six
presidents, starting with Daniel
Bradley in 1902, The next president
to be inaugurated was John H. T
Main in was, and the inauguration

‘cel'emorlies were held in the

Congregational Church, The

, students were allowed to welcome

the new president at the ceremony
only atter the trustees,
Congregational Churches oi iowa,
iaculty and alumni had done so.
The college ties with the
Congregational Church were still
quite strong.

ivlain was the president of the
college for over 5 years, so the
next inauguration was not until
1932, when the college inaugurated
John 5. Nollen. Although this was
the heart oi the Depression, the
ceremonies included a conierence
on “Education tor the New Day”,
with visiting protessors. At
Nollen‘s inauguration, the students
received somewhat more polite
treatment, being allowed to
welcome the new president second
getting classes dismissed (or a

1575

day. it was at this inauguration
that the custom or a luncheon,
reception, and dinner tor the
president was started.

The next inauguration was in
1940 when Samuel N. Stevens was
installed. This ceremony, which
was held (in Ward Field, was at-
tended by representatives irom 133
colleges and universities. in
conjunction with the inauguration,
several lectures were given on the
status of education and the small
college in particular.

Howard K. Bowen was
inaugurated as president oi
Grinnell ill 1955. The ceremonies
then were held in Darby Gym The
night belore the inauguration
ieatured an inaugural ball ior
students and guests, There was
also a special church service in
honor oi the inauguration.

The most lavish of all inaugural
ceremonies at Gl‘innell was the
most recent one, that ol Glenn
Leggett in 1966 At this
inauguration, a special exhibition
oi Twentieth century art in Iowa
was shown, as well as special
performances by the artists-in-
residence, the Lenox Quartet. and
the college orchestra. Guest artists
appeared with the quartet. There
was also a symposium on
“Literature and the Academy"
with several Gl'innell alumni who
were professors and working with
literaturer BM} erected a special
awning to stretch between the
Science building and Darby so that
the iormal procession could take
place without having to worry
about the academicians’ robes
getting wet. Again the ceremonies
were attended by educators from
all over the country,

This year, whcn A. Richard
Turner is inaugurated, the em-
phasis will be on the creative
impulses and elforts oi the college
community
