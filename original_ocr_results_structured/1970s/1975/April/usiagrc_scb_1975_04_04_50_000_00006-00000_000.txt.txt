Hiroshima, mon Amour, a film
createdby director Alain Resnais
(last Year in Marienbad, La
Guerre est Finie, Stavisky) in
collaboration with French novelist
Marguerite Duras, explores the
link between love and war through
the vehicle or memory.

The story is quite simple. “She",

Hiroshima participating in a
film on Peace, has an affair with

chance meeting leads to is an
overlapping or love in Hiroshima
and the actress’s experience oi
love in the small French village of
Nevers during the second world

For this couple, talk is

reason for remembering. Like you
I forgot."

This struggle between memory
and iorgettuiness has profound
implications for the film‘s ultimate
statement against war, and love's
role in creating an international
spirit. it is through Hiroshima that
she will remember and finally
forget her own experience in
wartime Nevers, where, as a
young woman, she saw her Ger
man lover killed at the Liberation,
and experienced the disgrace on
one who ared to love the enemy. in
one of the most exhausting scenes
of the film, this memory is evoked
in a most Proustian manner. In a
cafe, her lover serves as a catalyst
to the process of remembering.
Each sip oi beer brings out a
painful fragment; she speaks to
the Japanese, in a trance, as
though he were her dead German
lover. Then it is over, the story has
been told. She can finally forget,
yet at the same time recapture the
love she felt had died in Nevers. “It
was, you see, a story that could be
told. For iourteen years, i hadn’t
found the taste of an impossible
love again.“ For the Japanese, she
is now the symbol of love’s
iorgetrulness. Through them, love
and war, the horrors of Hiroshima
and Nevers are no longer
separate; all ot Hiroshima was
in love with all of Nevers. At the
end they iinally learn each other’s
name: He, Hiroshima; She,
Nevers. There is no sense of relief,
only numbness.

“Hiroshima, mon Amour”
cscapes all classification. It is a
triumph of all aspects or art,
poetry in its true Aristotelian
sense. Duras‘ dialogue and
narration is almost hypnotic, it can
be repeated and savoured. The
words blend perfectly with the
rythmn of Resnais' powerful
images which express a
cinematographic style which
ranges from the documentary to
the avantrgarde. The per
formances of Emlnanuclle Riva
and Elji Okada are flawless.
“Hiroshima, mun Amour" is an
experience that is at once
aesthetic, political, emotional, and
as witness to the power or its
message, unforgettable.
