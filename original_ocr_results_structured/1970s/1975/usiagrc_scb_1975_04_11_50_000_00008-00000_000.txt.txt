Tennis today

Spring is here again and beside
the new piles oi dung, the Grinnell
tennis team has again germinated
with lruittull expectations for the
upcoming season. Mother Nature
has been fickle to the netmen,
moving this afternoon's season
opening match against Ripon in-
doors, The match begins at 1 pm.
Competing this year will be an
improved Pioneer net squad,
featuring at number one singles,
the old “Steam Roller," Bob
Rosen.

Rounding out the top six, in order
are Dan tthe Man?) Edwards,
Andy Boozer Bloom, “the mean
stick” Rick Kellar, Carter
“Boomer" Newton, and Aaron
“Sly Slammeri’rsilverberg. Each
match consists oi six singles and
three doubles matches; two
possible Grinnell duos are Rosen-
Kellarand NewtonEdwards, while
the third doubles team should be
comprised oi Bloom, silverberg,
and John “the Bomb" Lom,

Backing up the headliners are
Lom, Mike “Alldy-Bloomrismy-
Hero” Brayndick. Tom ”Boom-
Boom” Arenlicrg, Tim “the
Tonguey Frog” llopkins, Tom
“Zorba” Kirizikils, Dave “Humbler
Howard Loves Me" Schecliter, and
John “The Duken Iwasaki,

At the helm of the “Lobers” is
Coach Ron Mitchell Who has
already discovered that coaching
tennis can be as hair-raising as
coaching football and basketball. A
nciv rule Mitchell will have to
contend with is :1 Midwest Crin-
lerence “agreement" that bans
coaches irom conversing with their
players during match play,

The weekend won't provide
iliilchzrest for the Pioneers as UNI
visits Crinncll ior a Tuesday
match. Whether Tuesday’s match
will be played indoors or out has
yet to be determined

While ('milcrcncc lavnrltes inv

College. causmg personnel

Complex Resulting irom a need to
cut the College’s budget, the ad

among the College’s athletes With
the recent elimination of several
teaching positions at the College,
the administration (eels justified at
this most recent budget cut,

The administration feels
justiiied in cutting the number oi

Les Hildebrand ther husband) has
turned down a different time slot

The concern among the athletes
centers around future main
tenance oi team equipment, while
Waldo Walker, dean oi the college,
justiiied the cuts by saying that
they will save Grinnell $7,000 a
year in pointing out that he had
trimmed the 197576 college budget
by $147,000 to meet trustees
demands, Walker called the budget
cuts “:1 [act of college

quality service to the students and
to members oi the campus comr
munity for the least cost, while
maintaining a high level oi ei-
Iiciency.” Regarding the athletes‘
questions about maintenance oi

comment that the college will hire
