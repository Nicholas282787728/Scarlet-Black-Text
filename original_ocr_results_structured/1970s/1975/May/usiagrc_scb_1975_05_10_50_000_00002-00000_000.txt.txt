Cooperative food movement

To the Editors:

Unknown to many people, the
'couperative lood movement is
rapidly growing. it Is especially
strong in the upper Midwest, There
are over iiity towns in Minnesota.
Wisconsin, lowa, and the eastern
Dakota’s in which buying clubs or
storefronts are located. The
movement is to a great extent
centered in the Twin Cities, for
here is the People’s Warehouse,
the great supplier ior most all oi
these cocps. The cities also have
iiitcen iood coops oi their own, plus
several coop resturants and
bakeries.

There are two major motives oi
the cooperative iood movement.
The iirst is to provide an alter-
native to the expensive capitalist
method. Food in Coops is priced
with a minimum markup, and all
proiits go back into the store. it is
the shoppers store, for all memr
bers attend meetings to decide
upon general policy, and work in

, the store several hours a week, A

coop provides a chance lor warm
and personal relationships to
develop between patrons.
something which is lacking in a
supermarket, because it enables
neighbors and triends to work
together. Since coups are largely
supplied by cooperatively run
warehouses, and their goal is to get
the food from farmer to user as
directly as possible by omitting
several middle steps, prices can be
kept low.

A second major motive is to
propagate a way oi eating that is
more healthy and less consumptive
than the normal American way.

Loss of Hoth

To the Editor:

The termination’of Sandy Hoth’s
contract aiter next year means the
loss to Grinnell not only of a fine
teacher and leader in Iowa
women’s intercollegiate sports, but
also the loss of another Woman
iaculty member. when ade
ministrators talk mostly about
survival, the institution becomes
more rigid about hiring and tenure.

To the Editor:

I would like to pass compliments
to Grinnell College’s Third Relays
Committee for the wonderful job
they did last Saturday aiternoon,
May 3, 1975.

It was handled very well. from
the beginning of the Relays to the
Barbequed Chicken Picnic. “All
Campus” later in the afternoon
was very nice, also the movie held
in the evening inside the Cowles
Hall Lounge.

For this reason food coops carry no
meat, bleached flour, or sugar, and
try to carry a good amount of
organically grown loods. Also,
coops do not prepackage the iood,
tor the shoppers bring their own
containers, and weigh out and
price their own orders. Processed
and prepackaged commercial
loods are not carried, ior these
involve ultraconsumption, oiten
questionable additives, extra steps
between farmer and user, and
insult one’s cooking ability.

Individual coups differ in what
they carry and how they are run,
but several generalizations can be
made. Primarily they carry all
types of beans, nuts, grain, and
ilours. Dried iruits, honey, peanut
butter, tamari, and many types oi
herbs, spices, and teas are com-
monly carried. Many iood coops
carry iruit, vegetables, and dairy
products irom local warehouses
and suppliers. Homebaked bread
and homemadeice cream are often
sold,

The Grinnell community started
to get involved in the cooperative
iccd movement this year when
several coop houses iormed a
buying club, the Grinnell Con-
sumer Coop. This group ordered
bulk merchandise from Blooming
Prairie Warehouse in Iowa City.
This warehouse really functions
more as a large buying and
distributing club, ior it has not yet
acquired funds and space to build
up a large stock4lence, many
orders were late in arriving.
Another major problem is that the
Grinnell Consumer Coop did not
make Contact With enough Grin-

Smile Dinner

Dear Editor:

The Korean Language Class'
crazy idea has worked out fine. So
far, over 40 students and 10
proiessors participated in the
Smile Dinner, and enjoyed an
Oriental meal and informal con»
versation. Most oi the participants
discovered that there are lots of
lovely people in the campus
community, and decided to keep
smiling all the time. As long as
there is somebody who cares about
our community, Grinnell will be
forever.

Very warm thanks have to go to
Mr. and Mrs, clotielter, Mr. and
Mrs. McKibben, Mr, and Mrs.
Babu, Mr. and Mrs. Jordan, Mr.
Woodworth and Ms. Abler, Mr. and
Mrs. Turner, Mr. and Mrs. Hans,
and Mr. and Mrs. Wall. The cook
wants to give her special hot recipe
to Libby Siegel, Robin Connelly,
and Pat Edmunds, instead oi
having to say a plain thank you, ior
all the help they offered. Also, the
best, in other words, only, Korean
cook in Grinnell has to be thanked
ior her creativcness in cooking.

better prospects, however, ior
Blooming Prairie will have grown,
and the Social Democrats of
Grinnell plan to organize the or-
ders, hoping to involve other
people besides students into the
buying club.

Although the Grinnell come
munity does not seem to have
enough interest to open a
storeiront, the Blooming Prairie
Warehouse recently decided to sell
[0 Vans Health Foods Although
Van’s is not cooperatively run, the
owners make practically no profit
on their store (being supported by
their farm), and they are ex-
tremely dedicated to the organic
food movement. Because they can
now order through the warehouse,
prices ior many products at Van's
are dropping quite a bit. The
reason prices have been so high
there is that their outside supplies,
up until now, have all been
capitalist companies that have
cornered the organic food market,

In having as small a markup as
possible, Van's is having trouble
staying in business, so to keep an
outlet for cheap natural foods in
Grinnell it is extremely important
ior the Grinnell community to
support Vans, and to consolidate
bulk orders with the buying club
next year, The closest food coop ta
Grinnell right now is the New
Pioneer Natural Foods Coop in
Iowa City. If you have the chance
you should stop and check it out on
South Gilbert street in Iowa City.

The cooperative iood movement
provides a constructive alternative
for those that protest the
capitalism, ultra-consumption,
and unhealthiness of the American
system. it provides natural foods
cheaply, and in a warm and simple
atmosphere. It provides the staff of
life outside at the giant agri~
business complex. ii that complex
crumbles, then our only recourse
will be to turn to ourselves and our
neighbors to organize our sources

Turner regrets
charges

To the Editor:

I deeply regret that seven
warrants have been issued to
Grinnell students in relation to
alleged'delivery oi a controlled
substance. While a college campus
is a place oi special opportunities
and freedoms, its residents are as
surely subject to the same
responsibilities of citizenship as
are members of the wider come
munity. And while the College tries
at all times to be of good counsel to
its students, it should be clear that
the common campus beliei that
legal authorities must request
permission oi the administration to
come on campus is erroneous,
Authorities in possession oi a
warrant can and do act
autonomously. Once legal
proceedings are initiated, students
must accept the responsibility ot
responding to due process oi law.
