Pioneers park 4.
but still winless

by Rich Arnold

The Grinnell baseball team
continued their losing ways this
past week With two non-Conference
losses Simpson bested the
Pioneers 571 in extra innings and
William Penn emerged a 1477
victor from a siuglest at
Oskaloosa. despite four Grinnell
homeruns. The diamondmen are
now winless in nine games and face
a difficult time in Cracking the win
column in their remaining games.

Paul Delaney llmlted Simpson to
one run and five hits over the
regulation seven innings, and
would surely have carded a win
except for the fact that the Simp»
son pitcher held Grinnell to one run
and five hits through seven in-
nings, also. Grinnell loaded the
bases with two out in the second,
fourth, and eighth innings, and in
the third with one-out, and only
scored one run. in the fourth when
Delaney walked scoring Rich
Arnold from third. Talk about
chances! Simpson had scored in
the third on a homerun by their
designated hitter.

In the eighul inning Simpson
scored three runs on a bases»
loaded double. and added a fourth
run later when the man on second
stole third and scored on a fielder’s
choice, The Pioneers threatened in
their half of the eighth but could
not put any runs across the plate,
so the boisterous Grinnell crowd
had to leave the “stands” subduedi
Tom Goetz collected two hits in the
game, to garner onerthird of the
Grinnell total of six.

Facing the beckoning shortr
fences and a stiff wind blowing out

to left ﬁeld at William Penn, the
Pioneer bats were singing as
Grinnell slashed eleven hits off of
two Penn pitchers. four of which
werehomeruns. Walks and fielding
miscues, plus eleven Penn hits,
more than overcame Grinnell's
offensive output, however. Big
hitters for Grinnell were Craig
zippc with two homeruns, a single,
and three RBl’s, Tom Goetz with a
single and a homcruii, Paul
Delaney, with two singles and two
RBl’s, and Dan Edwards with a
homerun.

Grinnell jumped off to a 2-0 lead
in the first inning on a Goetz
Single and a double off Mark
Haniseh’s bat, with Delaney
driving them both in with a shot to
the right oi second, Penn jumped
on Zippefor nine runs in the bottom
of the first, and Grinnell never got
closer than live runs during the
rest of the game, Grinnell scored
two more runs in the Second, one in
the third, and two in the fifth as a
result of the aforementioned four
homerunsl

The Junior Varsity dropped 124
and 11-1 decisions to the JV’S from
Simpson and William Penn,
respectively, in games held beicre
the Varsity tilts.

doublehaders against Graceland
and Cornell, respectively.)

Duffers struggle

byGordy Malaise

The Pioneers goli squad par-
ticipated in two meets this past
week with disappointing results in
each. Though finishing dead last in
the Drake Relays Tournament in
Des Moines, several men looked
promising on the treacherous
Wakunda course.

According to Coach Edd Bowers,
senior captain Arturo Tapia might
have earned himself a gold watch
for finishing in the first twelve had
he not developed a blister on the
iinai nine of the grueling sit-hole
two day meet.

Freshman phenom Mike
Hopkins shot two fine rounds of
golf on the narrow tree-lined
fairways and lightning-fast unr
dulating greens of Wakonda before
his score ballooned in his third
round. ,

Veteran Al Jessen and youthful
Dave Vanderpool played con-
sistently, though not spectacularly,
to round out the Grinnell
scorecard.

Iowa City’s long. historic Fink-
bine course, noted for its heavy,
rough, unyielding bunkers, was the
scene of the Iowa Invitational in
which the Pioneer linksmen
finished in the middle of the pack,
11th out of 21 teamsia heart»
breaking iinish, according to
mainstay Arturo Tapia, because a
difference of four strokes would
have put the squad in the top seven.

Again Tapia and Hopkins were
the leading Pioneers, with 3essen
and Vanderpool Close behind.

Two discouraged young golfers,
Denny Minami and Doug Cmelik,
recovering lrom encounters with
lhe hazardous Wakonda and Pink
hine courses respectively, will join
Gordon Malaise on the practice
fairway iii the hope of regaining
|hC old consistency which will lead
to a brighter future.

The near future calls for a two
day swing cast early next week
Monday and Tuesday) to Beioit
and Monmouth. Though these are
but lourtcani mocts, they are very
important on the road toward the
conference showdown. The

Pioneers will get a look at con-
ference opponents Carlton, Beloit,
Knox, Ripon, Cornell, and im-
pressive Monmouth. Equally
significant, the team will get a
taste of the Monmouth home
course, site of the ma Midwest
Conference Meet.

Senior Rick Kellar shows his twisting tendencies as he delivers a forehand smash in practice earlier this
week. The Pioneers fell to ISU 8—1 on Wednesday.

lSU rockets by netmen

by John [mm

In what can be called Grinnell’s
version of ”Bad Day At Black
Rock," the Pioneer netmen were
crushed 371 by Iowa State
University, Though it would not be
fair to say that the Pioneers were
outclassed, it was evident that they
were outplayed. The only bright
spot in the entire match was the
play of number six singles player
Carter Newton, who has cons

,sistently been beating opponents

this season. Newton trounced his
Iisiu. victim 5,2, as. Aside irom
that. the Pioneers provided ior

some excellent points, but still no
victories,

Earlier in the week the Pioneers
went to Cedar Rapids to take on the
Coe Kowhawks, but luckily for the
Kowhawks the match was called
off due to rain, with the Pioneers
leading 21. Winners in the ab-
breviated match were number two
and four singles players Bob Rosen
and Rick Kellar. Both kept their
cool despite the weather, and some
poor Coe sportsmanship.

Today, the Pioneers are up North
taking on the Midwest Conference
dciending champs, the Carleton

TV sports going sour

by DaveSehechter

Television’s impact on the sports
industry became evident this past
Saturday as ABC aired George
Foreman, deposed heavyweight
champion, fighting live hacks live
on national television. To say that
the program was a disgrace to the
broadcasting industry is not
enough; it was a,disgrace to the
world of sports. The fights, and
they more resembled pier-front
brawls. did more to harm boxing's
reputation than anythingin the last
decade.

Television has aided in the
springing up of franchises in any
city where a team can be bought,
borrowed, or stolen Seasons have
been lengthened partly to satisfy
the demand of television audienr
ces. Baseball is well into its season

while hockey and basketball have
yet to linish their playoffs And if
the Super Bowl has faded from
memory, the World Football
League will be on the air in July.

Not to criticize all television
sports — also shown last Saturday
was an excellent tennis match
between Jimmy Connors and John
Newcombe, the World’s two best.

In fact, the sport that has
henefitted the most lrom television
is tennis. In addition, ABC's
Olympics coverage is among the
linest programming in all of
television.

Drake field ”stiff"

by Russ Daintoft

Grinnell's track squad will travel
to Cedar Rapids tomorrow tor the
Coe Relays, one of the last tune-ups
before the conference meet at
Knox on May 10-17.

Most of the team will be coming
off a two week layoii due to the
Drake Relays, in which but two
Grinnell relay teams and one file
dividuai participated.

The individual, iavelin thrower
Chip Hall, did not place with his
180' throw Hall was competing in
the open division against Loprflight
athletes train all over the country.

The 440 realy tcam recorded its
best limo of the season. 0345.0, On

its way to a iiith place finish in the
Iowa College Division, topping
Central, Cornell, and Iowa
Wesleyan. The relay members
were Mark Bailey, Jim Fallace,
Kirk Krutilla, and Mark Schultz.

The mile relay squad dcleated
Buena Vista and Iowa Wesleyan,
while placmg Sixth in the lowel
College Div' ion with 3230.2, also
their best time of the season. Jim
Briles. Mark Bowman, Fallace
and Kl'utllla ran for Grinnell

“We ran well, but we were up
aglnst still competition," noted
Coach Maurice Hunt of the Drake
performance.

Roone Arledge, the mastermind
behind ABC sports, made a
mistake in telecasting the fights.
Foreman, fighting 20 pounds
overweight and without his usual
crew oi handlers, traded punches
with five nonnames. One he
wrestled to the mat after the fight
was over, another had lost 20 of 43
pro fights. In two cases the
decision might not have gone to
Foreman. Howard Cosell should
not have allowed himself to be
caught up with the action, as this
was far below the usually excellent
quality oi wide World oi Sports.

with its increase in live
telecasting (and through the ad-
dition of Brent Musberger to its
national crew) CBS has taken
away a portion oi ABC's audience.
There is still a vital need within the
industry for'men like Cosell and
Musberger, who are not paid shills
of the leagues, and who will add
some journalism to the telecast,

Television has done much to
bring major sporting events lrom
around the world into the living
rooms of millions of fans But
televlsmn does have a certain
responsibility to the public in its
decision of what to air. Those in
charge oi network sports
programming need to he a little
more selective in what goes on the
tube, II the trend of catering to the
violence demands of hockey fans,
and the showing of trash like lasl
weekend's lights continues,
Newton Minilow's “vast
\vzlstcl'ulnd'Y will have been
realized

Carls, The match should be a close
battle, If the Pioneer should pull off
a victory, it would definitely make
them serious contenders at the
Conference meet in two weeks.
Tomorrow the tennis team is at
home against William Penn (1:30
pm starti. If victory escapes
Grinnell, then its back to the old
drawing board.
