Birds take over

new by A. Richard turner

Don't come to “The Birds" expecting to see a museum piece, because this Greek comedy has instead served
as the catalyst [or an evening 0' improvisation under the direction of Associate Prolessor of Theater Sandy

Moffett.

The result is a mixture 0! slapstick and mood—at once one long smutty joke and the creation of a world ruled
by all types or birds, some recognizable, some not. The cast members took irom Ar tophanes’ text that which
is akin to Monty Python and Mel Brooks, and adapted it to modern staging techniques. The environmental
setting diminishes the usual strict delineation between audience and acting areas so that viewers are free to _
enjoy the iniormal evening as the pure entertainment it is intended to be, ‘
The play opens Friday night at 5:00 p.m. in Arena Theater, and runs through October isth.
