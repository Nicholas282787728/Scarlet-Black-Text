To the Editor:

President Turner in his recent
essay, “A View of the Future of the
College,” provided an important
iocal point in an eiiort to increase
the amount of trust and com
munication among various sec
tions of the Grinnell community.
it was particularly impressed
with Dr. Turner's perceptions oi
what the College's role should be

‘owards students. He emphasized,

n'tat, ”we must have it as a
stated goal to produce persons who
understand institutions and are
prepared to assume leadership in
‘making them function." Con-
cerned with the functioning of
institutions, Mr, Turner noted
several times in his essay that
students are becoming in-
creasingly suspicious of them, He
proposed that “these problems
can be met aiiirmatively only by
successiul participation in an
institution and community, where
one directly experiences the
satisiaction of serving and
leading." The president iollowed
up this idea of direct participation
by speculating that “most of us
would agree that governance of a

Once again the ialse con-

economic liberalism, political
liberalism, sexual habits, racial

hard to tell at times, We have been
constantly told that liberalism has

In light of the College’s
responsibility towards its students
(i.e. student participation in
college governance). it would seem
natural that they should have a
,voice on the Board oi Trustees.
What better ace exists for direct
student parti pation in the func-
tioning of an institution?

One would expect that Mr,
Turner would approve of students
directly experiencing leadership in
such a manner, especially since
the functions of the Board are “the
selection, retention, evaluation,
and dismissal of the president:
being responsible tor the tinances
oi the college; the deiinition oi
goals tor the college; evaluation oi
general performance . .” The
Board of Trustees is the place
where many of the major decisions
that concern the college land
student body) are made.

Dr, Turner, however, does not
conclude in his essay that students
should have a voice on the Board.
On the contrary, he states that,
“Preciscly because the Trustees

not enough

“separate themselves irom their
upper middle-class backgrounds."
Was not the author among those
who attended the movie? Can we
tell if somebody is liberal and
“deserve that title and (can) really
be Sincere and truthful with
themselves” simply because he or
She attended or did not attend a
movie? Could not somebody who
considered him-herself a Con-
servative attend ”Wattrstax?"

The author respects somebody
“who admits his (sic) con-
servatism and explains it,” So do
we. We also respect somebody who
has enough conviction oi mind to
associate their name with what
they say both for the benefit of
those who agree and disagree with
the ideas expressed. Students who
“don't know quite what it takes to
be liberal” could use something
more than a calendar of events for
liberals to attend.

We think that the question is
more involved than this and can
and should be discussed openly
Assertions are not enough.—

believeit to be a conﬂict of interest
tor the president to be a voting
member of the Board or for the
iaculty or students to sit on the
Board." The logic of this Statement
escapes me Students don‘t operate
the college. The College provides
them with certain services for
which they pay a tee; conv
sequently, they arc clients, not
administrators. Thus, Turner's
argument is inopertiveinsofar as it
applies to students, hence, it would
not be a Conflict of interest to have
students sit on the Board of
Trustees.

In iact, having student concerns
represented on the Board would do
much towrads improving the
ieeling of community that Mr.
Turner claims we should he

direct line to the Trustees are more
likely to feel 21 part of the Grinnell
family. And as communication
increases between the Trustees
and the students, the better
equipped these two bodies will he

Dr. Turner should be com-

Facing outside
realities

by Kathy Kramer

For twenty-one years I have
been relatively safe irom the
brutal oppression that many
women live with daily. My iamily,
my liberal public education, and
prcsently, Grinnell, have protected
me from the discrimination of the
economic and political systems.
But, my haven is only temporary
and soon I will have to face the
realities of a women’s position in
societv.

A combination oi my summer
job and feminist readings have
given me some ideas oiwhat i have
to lace. Lower pay for equal work,
diiiiculty in obtaining credit or
loans, the choice of motherhood or
a career are just a few of the more
obvious obstacles. The indignity of
Wolf whistles, the condescending
attitude oi many people, and uniair
media representation exhibit more
blatant oppression,

I see the manifestations of
sexism, but the causes are more
obscure There are no speciiic
enemies that I can strike out
against. I can kick the bank teller
who refuses my loan application,
but i can hardly directly attack the
largcr causes of the oppression.
My upbringing, societal mores.
the economic system, the media
and many others comprise the

roots of the real evils.

On a long term basis I can work
for changes on a broader scale. but
at this moment there are avenues
that I can also explore. By viewing
and talking with older women, I
can learn more about coping with
the current problems. They can
inform me of things I will have to
iace and present me with their
methods of dealing with them.

My peers add significantly to my
body of knowledge. Although many
sisters at Grinnell come from the
same upper middle class suburban
background as I do, we can share
our experiences. and grow
together. Individuals Whose up-
bringing varies irom mine can lend
a new perspective to the problems.

Finally, l look to myseli. Books,
newspapers, and magazine ar-
ticles keep me up to date on
national feminism. Consciousness
raising continues beyond the hour
and one half a week that I spend
with my friends. To be Satisfied
with myself, [continuously search
to see ii my ieminism integrates
itself into all aspects of my life.

My greatest source of strength
comes from the Sisters who are
struggling with me. When we band
together to face the future With
solidarity, we cannot be stopped.

Hibernation criticized

To the Edito .

I agree with Bob Curley‘s main
point in his article, “Back to
Nature," but question the im-
plications of his argument. It
.makes sense to State that, given
the American culture, the nature
freak is a member of the leisure
class, dependent on modern in
dustrialism. he gets into nature
only because he has the time and
money. Thoreau probably wouldn't
argue With that either, admitting in
the first chapter of Walden that he
borrowed an axe, symbollically
borrowing everything good and
necessary from the mainstream of
his culture. Despite Curley, this
appears to be a rejection at what
Curley calls a “stilling and lips
fulfilling Way oiliie,”’1‘horeauonly
borrowed an axe, he did not borrow
a bulldozer, a real estate agent,
lumber, a stove, a toilet, or even
toothpaste, deodorant, soap, or
anything else that could be shipped
on the railroad running nearby ,his
house.

Curley goes one step iurther,
arguing that the nature ireak is
more leisure Class oriented than
the millionaire on his yacht,
because “the millionaire at least
returns some service in, say, the
direction or his corporation; the
nature lreak returns nothing.” I
question the benevolence oi this
returned “service,” We have all
observed the role corporations and
wealthy individuals play in the
power structure of this country. At
least the nature freak is not part of
the political corruption symbolized
in Watergate or the Socalled
“trickle down" economic policy in
which corporate interests are
stimulated, which in turn, sup-
posedly from the economic activity
thus generated, progressively
stimulates each stratum oi the
economy. But inhard times nobody
spends money, not even the cor-
porations, so nothing is stimulated.

the status quo is maintained. it is
because of this maintenance of the
status quo that millions oi people
find themselves hopelessly stuck in
places like reservations, housing
projects, and unemployment lines.

The nature freak need not
assume direct responsibility lor
any oi this arrogance and injustice,
but, making himself invisible by
hibernating in his geodesic dome,
he has done nothing to oppose any
oi it. As Ralph Ellison would say,

As Concert Manager for the
Music Department, I get to pile

college, as well as their audiences.
The purpose oi this letter is to
address the latter, not the former.

It seems only fair and polite that
when a periormance is scheduled
for 8:00, and the doors are open to
the audience for 15-30 minutes
beforehand (except under unusual
circumstances), the audience
should arrive for the performance
before the doors are closed at 8:00.
The redsons are obviousi

the periormance. as well as

audience.

In both the Surbahar Concert on
Thursday, Oct. 30 in South Lounge,
and the Mirecourt Trio concert on
Nov. 1 in South Lounge, numerous
people came and [en throughout
the performances—some banging
the doors, and rudely walking in

the greatest social crime is to
overstay one’s hibernation, “since
there’s a possibility that even an
invisible man has a socially
responsible role to play.”

Rather than crit' izing the
nature freak ior his parasitic
relationship with the mainstream
of American culture, Curley should
have rerouted his argument, ob-

found audiences in Herrick Chapel

somewhat more Conscientious
(they hold, in general, more
formal performances) but with
still a substantial number of
latecomers.

It is an unwritten convention to
start all conccrts approximately

these persistant latecomers. but
