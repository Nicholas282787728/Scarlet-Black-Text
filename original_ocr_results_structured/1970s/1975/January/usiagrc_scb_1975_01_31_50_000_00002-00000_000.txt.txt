Coors
distribution
controls
end

Coors beer. until now available
only in a fourteen-state area may
soon be available for sale in the
Midwest and the rest of the US. In
a recent decision by the US.
Supreme Court, Coors was ordered
to end restrictions on their
distributors as to where the beer
could be sold. The Court upheld a
Federal Trade Commission ruling
which Stated that the restrictions
were anticompetitive and
therefore illegal,

However, there seems to be little
chance of Grinnellians being able
to retire to the Pub for a can of the
beer “brewed with pure Rocky
Mountain Spring water.” Mark
Nissen, manager of the Pub, said
that he doubted that Coors Will
attempt to expand their sales area
to include lowa. A spokesman ior
the Grinnell Beverage Co. also
expressed doubts as to whether
Coors would bother to expand. He
explained that at the present time
Coors is selling all the beer that it
can manufacture at its plant in
Golden, Colorado. Unless one at
Coors’ present distributors intends
to expand its territory to include
Iowa, the chances of the beer ever

a, i

, which has always
enjoyed phenomenal sales and
popularity, has been available ior
sale only west oi the Missouri
River ior years. However, en-
terpllsing individuals have been
bringing the beer east by various
methods and getting about twice
the retail price ior an equally long
time. One store in Washington,
D.C. has been selling Coors for
about $12 a case and having no
trouble iinding buyers. .

Coors contended that since the
beer was brewed and shipped while
refrigerated. the restrictions as to
sales area were necessary to
preserve the quality of the beer.
Distributors were also required to
dispose of all beer that was more
than 90 days old. Prices were also

, regulated by the Coors company

rather than the distributors Under
the new ruling Coors cannot
regulate either the prices or the
area in which their distributors
may sell. However. the ruling does
not require the company to expand
their number or area of
distributors, so the expansion of
sales area, if any, will be very
limited,

lSPIRG
Lobbying
Readied

A small chamber filled with
armchairs and a decent amount of
cigarette smoke is the workroom
ior lobbyists at the lowa
legislature in Des Moines. Five or
six Grinnell students will enter ﬂ'lis
room ii, as they are planning,they
lobby for ISPIRG (Iowa Public Ins
terest Research Group) this
spring.

“Lobbying is definitely the
product side of ISPIRG-‘the part
where things get done,” said Andy
Borsen, who is in charge of lob-
hying on campus, “It’s an in-
tersting and rewarding way to do
political work—to have an eiiect on
government.”

Matt Heine, chairperson of the
lSPInG Chapter on campus, ex-
plained that lobbying is the result
of all the research that various
ISPIRG members do throughout
the year. “It is the juncture, the
critical point, the place where
change occurs,” he stated.

borsen held a workshop for
propective lobbyists in December
and says he will hold additional
ones if the need arises. Following a
workshop, prospective lobbyists
choose an issue in Which they are
especially interested. With the help
of researchers they become
familiar with it. In Des Moines
they receive iurther preparation at
the main iSPIRG office. The
cloakroom is their final destination
where they observe another lob-
byist in action before actually
trying it themselves.

Lobbying ior ISPIRG entails
finding out whom to talk to and
talking to them. The emphasis is on
providing information, The
assumption is usually made that
the iniormalion will make it Clear
where ISPIRG stands on a bill,
Impartial intormation is provided
as oiten as possible.

Issues for which ISPIRG
members will be lobbying this
spring are the Bottle Bill, a result
oi the “BanrtherCan” campaign,
the Nuclear Moratorium Bill,
which would prevent construction
oi nuclear power plants in lowa, a
public utilities advertising bill,
which would prevent utilities from
advertising in a way that would use
raterpayers’ money to encourage
greater energy use, tax, land-
reiorm and striprminlng bills.

Borsen was the only person irom
Grinnell who did any lobbying last
year. Heine blames the lack oi
interest on academic pressure. He
explained that students don’t make
the lime ior things for which they
“Students
don't stop to consider how the
issues that ISPIRG is lobbying for
affect their lives," he added.

Both Borsen and Heine believe
that legislators are generally
receptive to ISPIRG lobbyists,
“ISPIRG is taken very seriously in
the legislature, by the Register and
Tribune and the governor’s office. .
. .Especially in Iowa the
legislators seem to be rational and
sane bunch oi people, You don't get
the teeling that you're working
with a bunch of idiots and crooks,”

“In the last two years the power
of ISPIRG has been growing,
Observed Heine. “At first people

were a little incredulous about
students actually trying to get into
things and change them.” But,
Heine went on to say, otter seeing
the quality and depth of ISPIRG
research, people really began to
listen. Borsen and Heine believe
that ISPIRG lobbyists will have a
substantial influence on Iowa
legislators this session.

SGA
hosts KDIC
talk show

KDIC presented its first talk
Show based entirely on a callrin
format this year when SGA officers
hosted the initial program oi a
Sunday night series, But the
broadcasts hardly started out with
a hang.

President John Hansen and Vice-
President Pete Reiner invited calls
on any subject irom any member
oi the campus community. Both
hosts admitted that the response
was disappointing, but not unex-
pected. “We didn't get much
publicity,” Hansen said.

The Show, which has no official
name, had iew callers, iorcing
Hansen and Reiner to discuss and
joke between themselves and to
play music. The hosts said they
hoped iuture shows would have
more discussion with callers. less
humor and less music. Each
mentioned the discussion with a
caller near the end of the program
about the depressed mood oi most
Grinnell students as the kind of
talk they wanted.

Most of the callers that did phone
the Show, which runs from six to
nine o’clock, had an organization
or project to publicize.

Hansen said he was disappointed
with the first show, which he called
“a trial run,” whereas Reiner said
he was pleased. But both have high
expectations for future shows
KDIC Program Director Steve
Hirtle said he was impressed with
the first show and added that the
series ”will be kept on as long as
people keep calling in and have
something to say. But when it
becomes repetitive, we’ll take it
off,” Hansen sald he expects the
series to continue all semester,
