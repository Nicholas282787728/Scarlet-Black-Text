On Record,

Back somewhere in 1970, there
existed an obscure rock ensemble
named Jethro Tull, who had a
following consisting of a handful of
fanatical fans. In the following
year, the group suddently shot into
stardom when they released a
masterpiece in sound entitled
Aqualung. Tull followers finally
had something to brag about, and
rightly so,

Unfortunately, these believers
have been living on past glories
ever since. Ian Anderson‘s next
record, a concept album entitled
Thick as a Brick, was brillant on
side one, but side two dragged a
bit, (Anderson is flutist and lead
vocal and writes most of the
songs),

A Passion Play followed Thick as
a Brick; here, Tull and their
lolloivcrs were thrown deeper into
a gully of criticism, Reviewers
proclaimed that A Passion Play
was drab, dull and dreary, At this
point. Anderson, with a heavily
wounded ego, announced his
retirement from music and the
stage.

One year later, he and his gang
suddenly retaliated with a glit~
tering, galloping album entitled
War Child. The record was very
commercial; it even contained a
song which became a “hit single”
on AM radio. Anderson had Won his

fame back. but unfortunately, in'

the process he had given up his
pride. At this point many Aqualung
enthusiasts gave up on their faintly
glimmering performer; it seemed
as if Anderson had traded his
musical professionalism for the
common rock objective: pecuniary
advancement.

Today an unusually pleasant
surprise seems to have appeared,
Anderson and Tull have finally
released an album (Minstrel in the
Gallery) with subtlety and sub-
stance similar to their Aqualung
days.

Minstrel in the Gallery is a
collection of individual songs,
which seem to demonstrate Tull'sl
movement away from basic
monetary desires toward a higher

iorm otart. Many oi the songs here,

are much more soft and melodic
than War Child. An excellent
example of this mood is
“Requiem,” a number that
features Anderson and his lone
acoustical guitar. The melody here
seems to swirl in a way not unlike a
calm stream ﬂowing in the days of
early England.

More characteristic of Ann
derson’s early period is the title
track, “Minstrel in the Gallery "
This song is structurally similar to
“Wind-up” a number from

Aqualung. “Minstrel in the

Anderson and his guitar, followed
by a much more electrical at-
mosphere. with Martin Barre’s
guitar dominating the scene. On
this title track Tull seems to come
very close to the genuis of
Aqualung.

In Minstrel in the Gallery, An-
derson draws the better aspects
from all sections of his musical
career, taking the simple in
ventlveness of his past and mixing
it with his present advantage of
being a more experienced
musician. He creates a collection
of songs which illustrate his
heightened musical sensitivity.

In Concert

Jethro Tull’s recent appearance
in Des Moines was an unusual,
delighttul spectacle, to say the
least. Through seven years of
touring. Anderson has grown in
creasingly sagucious in his an»
ticipation of the desires of the
audience; his Show at Veterans’
Auditorium illustrated this fact.

Anderson’s ability to mystity the
Iowan crowd was ever present; as
always, he was a showman as well

Tull , regains former standing

saxophonist, and guitarist.
Leaping from one edge of the stage
to the other,he kept the audience in
constant expectation of events to
follow.

His gimmicks were quick and
frequent, Some were amusing
(Anderson’s sarcastic description
of various rock groups), but most
were downright silly. Jokes in the
latter category included such
topics as zebra dung and diarrhea
Other amusements included trite
rock tricks such as smoke and
fireworks.

Near the show's conclusion, one
surprising element witnessed was
Anderson’s defense of these
gimmicks. It seemed as if he read
the minds of the skeptical crowd
watching him when he said, “I’ll
agree that I have many gimmicks,
but every performer has his
gimmick, Elton John has the crazy
glasses, Mick Jagger has the big
lips, and David Bowie, well, he
doesn‘t know which way to turn!”

It perhaps Tull’s visual ens
tertainment was a bit overdone,

their melodies certainly made up
for the antics. The group’s muSlc
