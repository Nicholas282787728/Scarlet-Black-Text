include a comprehensive exam in
the student’s major area and two
others of his or her choice. The
program would culminate in the

raised during the year have in
cluded the more routine problems

After adoption oi the minutes as

move

The Career Services Office and
the Offices of udent Affairs and
Academic Adv ng are Scheduled
to move into 1119 Park Street, just
south of Nollen House, in the fall of
next year, Some questions have
been raised as to the need and the
iunding oi this relocation.
However, Jim Tederman, Dean oi
Student Affairs stated that the
move will enable each office to
better and students as well as
allowing them to easily combine
their counseling services. He and
Jim Avison, Vice President io_r_
institutional Development also
explained that the entire project is
being financed by the class of 1925.

in his proposal to the Committee
on Counseling November to, 1973,
Tederman explained that,
“Students seldom have just an
academic problem. There are
usually personal problems in-

to crossslist the new course after ,

little debate. Other questions or-
cluded prerequisites for the new
olierings oi Ecologlcal An~
thropology and Human Evolution,

An interesting discussion
revolved around Athletic
Management and Techniques, an
introduction to training and con-
in preparation ior
coaching iootball, basketball,
baseball, and wrestling, and track
and field. There was much debate
as to the nature of prerequisites ior
the course which presently carries
none, The question arose as to
whether the course was intended
solely for students who wished to
be certified as coaches as a part of
a teaching career. There was some
concern that this would decrease

.enrollmcnt by eliminating from the

program those students who
wished to use the information in
other ways, ior instance, as
Counselorscoachcs at summer
camps, Professor Atwell stated
that the proposed prerequisites did
not eliminate as many students as
Professor Parslow had implied in
his remarks. She proposed the
implementation oi educational
psychology courses to supplement

debate, the matter was left

unresolved.

Tederman explained that the
idea of combining the three offices
originated three years ago. In

plans ior a psychologist from the

new counseling center a few days a
week. “Students could see him
there or at the Mental Health
Center," explained Tederman.

However, when the Counseling
Committee invited the Director 0
the Mental Health Center to
discuss the situation, it was
decided that it might not be
ieasible to have the psychologist at
the center. So it was decided to go
with just the three offices. .,

lirst semester oi this school year

Although the plan had been
approved, Tederman explained
that those involved realized “if
such a project was to take place at
all it would have to landed through
a ioundation or private gilts,” He
said that Avison had been talking
to alumni who seemed in favor of
the plan. The Class of l925 decided
to take the renovation of the house
rotas a class project.

Avison explained that it is the
class 0f1925’s golden anniversary,
He said that on a 50th anniversary

special. They chose the renovation
as their project, The class will

Fell, who died recently, was a class
agent for '25, as well as the only
general class agent Since the
system was organized. “Bob was
kind of a special person to them,”
explained Avison,

Avison stated that estimates of
from $16,000 to $13,000 have been
given him, primarily by Dale
Hawn, director of the Physical
Plant. Tederman said that final
lloor plans have not been drawn
up. He explained that the various
directors and deans were planning
to meet with Hawn over break to

work on them. “Hopefully it will be
ready to go by fall, A lot depends on
the work schedule of B St G It may
not be ready until second
semester,”

Tederman explained that the
space vacated by Student Affairs
and Academic Advising would be'
available for use by student
groups. He explained that Director
oi Academic Advising, Raymond
Obermiller’s office would be
vacated. Also, if SAGA moved
onto South Campus, their Forum
oiiices would also be empty. If
SAGA does not move, South
Campus could be used by students.

Christopher McKee, Librarian,
said that the "space now occupied
by Career Services would be used
