most annoying smiling visage,

cream, could in no way be removed
from the wall, Prints were
mounted in the hallway to conceal

replaced with new ones as the
Crackerbox occupants grow tircd

“I have always regarded myself
as an entrepreneur. l find building
things both exciting and
exhilarating.”

Whether pulling on a cigar in a
iorum FDR or sipping sherry in a
faculty home, Edward E. Booher,
the second Woodrow Wilson Fellow
to Visit Grinnell this school year,
had engaging stories and my
tercsting insights to share about
his experiences in the publishing
World. From his position as
president of the Books and
Educational Services Group of
McGraw-Hill, Inc., Mr Booher
appeared quite comfortable
talking informally with students
and faculty members on a variety
of topics, ranging from oppression
of blacks in South Africa to
technical advances in the field of
publishing,

The concern most often voiced
by Booher during his four-day visit
to Grinnell was that of “the
possible demise 01 American book
publishers who knew and loved
books, but also liked to live well
and make money,” the sub-title oi
his Monday night lecture. The
Woodrow Wilson Fellow
epitomizes this characterization.
He advanced through the ranks of
McGraerill on the literary rather
than management front, and iully
retains his appreciation of good
books, possessing the unique
ability to memorize, at first
glance, the title of any book one
may happen to be carrying.

Publishing was the topic most
widely discussed with the Buoher.
who held strong opinions on the
matter. Tracing the history of the
publishing business from its
“crude casual beginnings in the
late 18th century to its present
variegated and gigantic growth,”
Bcoher, in his South Lounge lec-
ture, expressed hope ”that these
changes will help to make our
industry something other than just
another business . . The purpose
oi assisting with learning, of

providing better information, and
oi making available worthwhile
entertainment through books is
highly commendable . , , It's an
endeavor worth seeking and
pursuing,” .

The industry has had its share of
unusual experiences, especially
when dealing with authors. Eonher
recalled that. the only book

McGraerill ever decided to Stop
while still on the presses was
Clifford Irving’s novel work on the
mysterious Howard Hughes.
“Irving started to worry about
repercussions against his book, so
he raised the price that he was
charging McGraerill, hoping we
would decline to publish it,”
Booher explained. As is well
known, the book became a scandal,
but McGraw-Hill originally
decided to go ahead and publish the
book at higher cost, accepting
Irving’s explanation that Hughes
had demanded more money.
Booher still chuckles remembering
the decision.

Yet despite this dig at a par
ticular author, Booher firmly
believes that “the greatest asset to
a publisher is not listed on the
balance sheetiit's the authors.”
Publishing at McGraw-Hill entails
seeking out authors, editing
manuscripts, and marketing,
“There is no real production work
involved; it’s a peoplerlntensive
industry,” It was brought to light
that out oi 25,000 to 30,000 un-
solicited manuscripts received a
year, very tew~maybe two or
three—are actually published.
Booher attributed this to the
number and quality oi authors
obtained through commissions or
literary agents. However, he
agreed that “we need people with
guts to publish new authors."

Mr, Booher acknowledged a
reduction in the growth of new
fiction being published, and
atrributed the decline in his
assessment to “a happy slowdown
of bad novels published, acs
companied by a speedup oi bcttcr
paperback editions reprinted, a
phenomenon good both for the
reading public and for the book
publishing industry, if not ior
aspiring novelists," He contended
that publishers must “go back to
serving their communities and
learn they cannot make an ideal
profit on everything that is
published" He expressed op-
timism that “those of us who are
dubbed the ‘glants' oi the industry
. . will surely learn, to paraphrase
a well known playwright, that ‘the
book is the thing.’ ”

Scrving acoiporation with
subsidiaries literally all over the
world, Boohcr has traveled exs
tensivcly. He has sampled many

cultures and recognized that

American education and literature
are not always suited to the needs
of other nations. “We have to
publish in other countries the
Works of authors from those
countries. geared to the cultures bi
those countries," he explained.

South Africa is a specific case in
point. There, Booher detailed,
racial differences are very strictly
defined so that even McGraw-I-Iill
must employ whites in the offices.
Coloureds to warehouse
management, and blacks only to
work in the warehouse, However,
Booher contended that MCGraws
Hill is taking steps to improve the
South African situation. ”After
three years of working with
educational authorities in the
Bantu areas, we’re becoming the
first publishing house to publish in
the social and natural sciences for
the Bantus, at no profit.” Noting
the terrible disparities of the social
system of South Africa, Booher
pointed out that white students
receive free school books through
the educational division, While
black pupils are forced to pay.

Booher is called upon to travel by
other groups than his company. He
recently returned from India
where he participated on an Indnr
American citizens’ committee
designed to study technical,
economic, and educational and
cultural similarities between the
two Countries ”to remove common
misconceptions." The five»day
mission was born of Kissinger's
November trip to the area, which
alienated India as the US, sought
closer ties to Pakistan. according
to Booher.

This visit to Grinnell was Mr.
Booher's first experience as a
Woodrow Wilson Visiting Fellow,
and he looks forward to further
appointments. “I'm having the
best time I’ve had in years,” he
declared. Though Mr. Booher had
never traveled to the Grinnell
campus before, he has recomr
mended the college to‘ others
numerous times. “Good material
comes from good people. In the
business I’m in you get to know the
quality institutions ” Concerning
another portion of the Grinnell
populace, Mr. Boohcr was forced
to admit, “As a student body
you’re a hell oi a lot more decent
than I had anticipated,”

Trio
hired

“Performance of passion and
fullrblown romantic sweep mat-
ched by stylistic cohesion and
technical expertise," reported the
New York Times about the Feb. 3
Carnegie Hall debut of the
Mirecourt Trio, from California
State University at Fullerton and
recently hired as artist-in-
residence at Grinnell College. The
decision by the college to hire the
trio was made after the favorable
reaction to their New York ap-
pearance and after receiving
several favorable recoms
mendations from musicians across
the country, including one from the
world-renowned cellist Gregor
Piatigorshy,

As of Monday, no tormal an-
nouncement oi the hiring had been
made by Dean Walker because not
all of the three signed contracts
had yet been received from the
artists.

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Mirecourt Trio recital in
New York was a repetition oi their
concert at Grinnell, Jan, 24. The
performance oi the D minor
Mendelssohn trio, the Trio in A by
Sigismund Thalbcrg and the F
minor Trio by Dvorak was con-
sidered by Robert Sherman of the
New York Times as being
“buoyant, assertive, and zestful.”
The works were representative 0[
the move by Kenneth Goldsmith,
violinist, Tcrry King, cellist. and
John Jensen, pianists, toward
reviving works that have fallen out
oi favor

In choosing artists-ln-residence
the collcgc considered several
groups, but the Mirccourt Trio was
the only one to appear for a per-
formance at Grinnell, The
responsibilities oi the group next
ycar will primarily be the same as
those held by the Manhattan String
Quartet, performing. classroom
and private teaching, and work
with student music organizations
