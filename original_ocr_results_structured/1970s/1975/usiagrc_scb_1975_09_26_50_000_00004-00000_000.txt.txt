Tlle Grinnell Scarlet and Black, September 26,1975—p. 4

New revolt

Tuition and student rebellion, two seemingly unrelated
issues have combined to fire off some rather unusual scenes
this past year at such college campuses as Brown, Brandeis,
and the University of California at Santa Barbara. As in the
60's, students were once again storming the administrative
offices and raising an outcry (albeit a mild one]. But this
time the issue was large increase in tuition charges.
Rebellious anger has been transferred from moral outrage to
financial outrage.

The war cry may be ”We stopped the War. We can stop
this." but the economic adversary may be harder to heat.
The Department of Health, Education and Welfare reports
that as the overall enrollment in schools and colleges drops
an estimated one-quarter of one percent this fall, the total
cost of education in the United States will rise about $11
billion over the previous academic year. Comprehensive
costs at ten of the highest-priced lbut not necessarily the
best) institutions range from $5,600 to $6,280.

The middle-class is in serious danger of being squeezed out
of the college market entirely as these prices gain momen-
tum, Financial aid is increasing at some colleges and staying
the same at most. Many colleges are similar to Grinnell in
that close to 50 per cent of their students are on some form of
financial assistance. Either students must have a great deal
of money or not enough. But, there also seems to be serious
danger ahead for financial aid students if available scholastic
funds begin to decline any faster.

Grinnell, reported by Tin-1e magazine in its
September 8 issue to be a ”bargain priced” ”first»rate
institution,” has not been showing any signs of
going against this tuition hike trend. President A. Richard
Turner says that he is well aware that increasing costs are
”running well ahead of the rate of inﬂation of the economy in
general,” but he says that there really is no solution in sight
for a raise which looms somewhere in the near future.

Grinnell has been receiving increased funds from the Iowa
Tuition Grant Program and still has a large pool of funds for
those in need of financial assistance, but these are of no
benefit to students from families which just miss financial
aid availability.

Small private colleges such as Grinnell have not gotten
together to plan some long-range solution. No other in-
stitutions of any size or affiliation have really made any
realistic attempts to head off an educational disaster.
Whether student rebellions can make any difference at all is
questionable. Perhaps a President at one school can say,
“Sorry, no other way,” but can every president at every
school in the country stand up to universal protest? Can the
HEW?

Perhaps this protesting is for a selfish and capitalistic
purpose. And then again maybe it may be a cry for our very
right to an education. There is a limit to how long American
students can ”grin and bear it.”

Sludent Board in Grinncll College.
Here we introduce ourselves to the

Foreign Student Board is not
merely a hunch oi alicns, but
rather we think that we are
Grinnell students who know some
other part oi the world better than
most students do. So do kccp us in
your mind and don‘t hesitate to
take advantage oi having the
hunch with you, We’re getting
smaller, but we will be here

be remembered from the Chick

of about a year ago. Aliercrombie
plays a good guitar throughout all
the songs. but Allschul’s per»

there are cight people making
noise behind Liebman Richard
Beirach plays a Fender Rhodes

which helps hide his inexperienced
chops. Somehow. despite all oi the

you can iind him on John

His influences (all Selfs
