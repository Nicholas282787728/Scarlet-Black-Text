What role sports?

by Kitwnll

Initially I planned to write a rebuttal to the article concerning Title IV
of the education amendment printed in the stain two weeks ago. The act
states that men's and women s athletics must receive equal funds at any
educational institution receiving federal ﬁnancial assistance Although
still barely adequate the iinancial situation Ior women s sports at
Grinnell is improving. However, where deficiencies are present, men’s
athletics are in the same bind as women’s; equipment, if available at all,
is sometimes out-dated, and many sports get by with only the bare
issentials. So, the question arises, what part do athletics play at Grinr

nell'?

Almost everyone has made a trip to the Complex during hither stint
ere, most people more than once Believe it or not. more women use the
nplex than men, but many ”nonvjock" males ireouent the place7

jogging,
basketball, to name a few,

swimming, playing handball,

racquetball, squash, and

So why. with all the traffic that the Complex recieves due to What i
ﬁsume to be an interest in sports, does the North “Jock" CampuS#South
intellectual" Campus schism still exist? Since a “jock" juggles an
average schedule of classes, approximately two hours of practice a day,
an additional iive hours per match, meet, or game, plus various ad
ditional extracurricular activities, he or she surely is not a mental
midget, Acceptance into Grinnell indicates this. if nothing else,

Most of the studenteathletes here rarely fit into the basic

iiiocko

stereotype andhaveno desire to Even ii they did, whatever happened to
our liberal spirit “to each his or her own?" I have overheard Cons
versations where a person has been criticized for being a ”jock ” and yet
in the same breath criticized for not being go at enough to have made it

ithletically at a ”big jock" school. Why crit

'ze the “jock?” Does the

term stand ior something wrong at Grinnell?
Few criticize people involved in theatre music art or politicsiwhlch
is asitshould be everyone is iree to pursue their individual interests All
ins have hobbies, which contribute to the essential iacets oi our perr
.alities. Such activities provide enjoyment tor the participants as well
asthe observers, and sports are no exception. We can all remember the

passe, hip expression, “different strokes for diiferent folks,"

so m'a ybe

we can remember to apply this to lile at Grinnell. Maybe ive can begin to
practice the open mindedness we all proiess

Veteran Robin Connelly com-
mented that what hurt the women

dividual periorinances nere
turned in by a iew Pionee--,
particulaily Lisa Ilopp at the net
and Uisina Baumgaitner with
some spectacular saves.

Coach Donna Meck stated prior
“wc’re
much stronger this season . , . We
have an attack to go with our

to concentrate primarily on fun
