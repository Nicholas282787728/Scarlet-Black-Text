a Udall stresses energy

By DougSchultz

As an “advance man” for his
brother, Congressman Morris
Udall (Ariz.). candidate tor the
Democratic Presidential
Nomination iormer Secretary of
the Interior Stewart Udall spoke
with students in South Lounge
Wednesday morning.

It appeared from Udall’s
opening remarks and from the way
in which he iielded questions that
the Udall campaign’s main cone

teerns are the energy situation and
the position of candidates on issues
of the past as well as the present.

Udall opened by saying that “the
fact of the matter is, the last two

1presidential campaigns were
dominated by Vietnam." Without
the emotional pull of Vietnam,
Udall said, “this will essentially be
a. a different kind of campaign.” He
{Welt that voters will be asking two
main questions: What were the
positions of candidates on issues of
the past and what are the issues of
today and where do the candidates
stand on them?

On the issues of the past, Udall
stressed his brother’s early
reiorming and dissenting ten-

dencies, “My brother was one of
the early people'for taking a strong
stand against Vietnam,” Udall
said.

According to Udall, his brother
was the first candidate to open
offices in Iowa. Morris Udall was
also an early supporter of civil
rights. school desegregation, and a
reformer against the
Congressional seniority system.
Also, according to Udall, the
candidate was an active agent for
Common Cause and presidential
election campaign relorm.

0n issues of the present, energy
dominated Udall’s remarks. All
issues discussed seemed to lead
back to the “energy imperative.”
Udall believes that there must be a
“basic restructuring” of American
society embodied in a push [or a
conservation and a “new. leaner
life style implicit in the energy
revolution that is already upon
us.”

Said Udall, “All signs point to the
fact that we’re entering an age of
scarcity—that we’re ending a
period of time when we had a

cheap abundance of resources.
And this is going to force us to
come to grips with these problems
not with the old solutions. but with
new ones."

As part of mat “restructuring
process, .Udall is in favor of
breaking up giant oil companies
before they become “energy
conglomerates." He believes
competition should be restored by
legislation rather than antitrust
suits.

Transportation must also be
revamped according to Udall. He
would make changes by moving to
smaller cars and increasing public
transportation usage, including
railroads.

While much of official policy is
still in the formulative stages,
Udall, noting that his brother will
soon be coming out with his ioreign
policy paper, did say that he is a
supporter of detente with the
USSR, In the middle easti Udall
feels the U.S. must play a major
stabilizing role and maintain its
“long standing committment to
see that Israel survives,”

;,Bohd issue defeated

:Close win forGraham, Raffety

by Bill Burke

Incumbents Vernon Graham and
Maynard Raflety narrowly won
reelection to three year terms on
the Grinnelllvewburg Board of
Education on Tuesday, September
so The bond issue which would have
financed construction of a new
senior high school was defeated, as

it was last December,
This time the measure received
npport from 52 per cent of the
electorate, as compared to 39 per
cent last year. A so per cent at-
' irmative vote was needed for

_gpproval. An additional measure,
which will allow the district to
raise more funds [or school
maintenance, passed by a vote of
1,628 to 1,308.

Vs The board election was a par-
ticularly close one, with Graham
defeating Richard Sears 1,629 to
1,537, while Raffety edged
Raymond Larsen by a vote of 1,633
to 1,590.

Commenting on the election
results Tuesday night, Graham
told the Grinnell HeraldRegister,

mince the bond issue received 52

per cent this time, it appears that
people are beginning to think that
we have to do something about our
schools, and that makes me more
_ptimistic.”

‘1 RaIfety added, “1 hope that
people now will join together to
work for the benefit of the children

i in the district. There's nothing to
gain by continuing to light one
another,”

As in the past, the breakdown oi

~ returns showed strong dirierences
of opinion between northern and
other parts of the school district.

PrecinctNo. z, Bailey Park School,
which covers area north of High
way a, supported the bond issue by
a margin of better than two to one.
Nine hundred and seventy votes
were cast in favor of the proposal,
compred to 440 against, Raffety
and Graham also received strong
support in the precinct.

Pre ' ct No. 1. the tire station,
representing a sizable chunk of the
southern edge of town, voted 377 to
473 against the bond issue, and
favored Larsen and Sears in the
board election.

Emotional issues in the came
as

paign centered upon the efforts of
some area residene, led by Ben
See, to remove allegedly obscene
books from the school library.
Rebuffed in their efforts by the
local school board and the county
superintendent of schools last
spring, they concentrated their
attention on the board election.
Principal among their aims was
the defeat of both Graham and
Raffety. Who had voted to keep the
hooks in question on the library
shelves. Included among the
allegedly obscene books were:

recent bond issue defeat“

Voter turnout was generally
light, particularly in the south end
of Grinnell where 350 fewer voters
went to the polls on Tuesday than
during the election on the bond
issue last (all.

According to history and
American studies proiessor Alan
Jones, the chances for passage of a
new bond issue sometime in the
near future now appears con-
siderably brighter. For the iirst
time, a majority of voters sup
ported by the proposal. However, it
is generally believed that any new
bond issue will be for a smaller
amountof money, probably around
$3 million, and will most likely call
for a Site south of Route 6.

College iaculty turnout in the
election was iairly high. Concern
over the quality oi education in
Grinnell’s Schools has increased
with the repeated failure of past
bond issues.

This point has been dramatically
emphasized by the departure of at
least one member of the college
community. In a recent letter to
the Grinnell Herald-Register,
Charles Seller, former dean of
records and ofﬁcampus study,
stated that whathe saw as a lack of
commitment to quality education
in Grinnell had forced him to seek
a new position elsewhere.

The level of student involvement,
while greater than in recent local
elections, still only represented a
small percentage of the total
student body. However, the
election did mark the first signs of
a growing community awareness
on the part of the college students.
