The Grinnell-Newburg Come
munity School district, plagued
with a 3 month old book con~
troversy and scars oia better bond
issue tight, was iurther distressed
yesterday by the revelation that
two school board members had
been involved in a physical cone
irontation and that portions or two
Jasper County townships may
attempt to withdraw lrom the
system.

The Confrontation between
Harold McCulloch, board president
and Vernon Graham, board
member, took place Feb. 13.
However, information on the in-
cident was withheld by Donald L
Schild, county attorney, until
yesterday,

According to a joint statement

' issued through Schild by Graham

and McCulloch, Graham and his
brother were leaving the Cattle
Call Care at the Grinnell Livestock
Exchange about 4:30 Feb. 13 when
McCulloch approached him.

While his brother remained
inside to continue a conversation
with two iriends, Graham went
outside, the statement said, to talk
with McCulloch.

McCulloch gripped Graham “in
the area of the neck” after he in
terpreted Graham‘s actions as
aggressive, He held Graham
against a heavy, wood fence until
the two were separated by
Graham's brother, George,

The Graham brothers then
reported the Incident to Grillnell
police.

McCulloch said later he
misinterpreted Graham’s moves
and that there was no aggression
on the other man’s part. He
apologized both verbally and in
writing, Graham accepted that
apology and expressed a desire to
“forgive and forget," the
Statement sald He also declined to
file charges.

Another potential problem im-
the district suriaced Tuesday when
Harold Fleener, trustee or Rock

Creek township in Jasper County, v

said that part of the Grinnell-
Newburg District might wish to
withdraw ircm the system to join
the Lynnville-Sully school district,
which adjoins the area on the
south.

He said the recent drtorl vote oi
the school board to allow three
controversial novels to remain on
district shelves was “the last
straw”, but that pressure had been
building ior some time.

Delwin Cross, a member at the
Lynnville-Sully school board, said
he had been contacted by Fleener
about the situation, but that no
iormal action had yet been
requested, ‘

GrN district officials said they
had not been oiiicially approached
about the possible withdrawal, Don
Larsen, district board secretary,
said itwould mark the first lormal
attempt in the district’s history of a
segment of the system to with-
draw.

A [mail problem for the dlstrict
arrived on Acting Supt, of Schools
L. Mlchael Slushcr‘s desk 'l'ilur»
sday morning

Bell See, the 37rycarrold lay

minister whose November-
petitions against three novels
started the long running book
controversy, iiled a complaint
against Medieval and Early
Modern Times.

He claimed the book ”teaches
religion in violation oi the lowa
Constitution” and “could cause
children to question the religious
veliei oi their parents "

Dorms appear to Suffer from the
same ills. With the returned
reports train the mass hall
meetings on dorm renovation held
Fens, the general result points up
problems that are very similar,
mostly short term, and minor
expense items, The iirst dorm
renovation committee convened
Tuesday evening to evaluate the
individual reports of each dorm’s
improvemelt session.

Lighting, insulation oi pipes and
windows, connecting doors bet-
ween singles, bookshelves, onoii
faucets, medicine cabinets, pay
phones,,tuned pianos, bulletin
boards, and painting emerged as
the chief faults of the campus
dorms. Dean of student allairs
Tederman believed these problems
could be relieved in 5 to 6 years
without major expense.

Very little mention of the social
environment in halls occurred in
the hall conferences, to the
disappointment oi the committee.
Many committee participants
attrlbuted this to hall members’
difficulty in expressing this social
ill concretely and the over
shadowing precedence oi the
dorms' physical needs. The only
aspect oi the social environment
that received the hallsY attentions
was the possibility oi a student
remaining in the same room for
more than a year as a means or
increasing social cohesion within
dorms, Reaction was divided on
this with neither side Clearly ob»
taming more support.

“Show us the money and We’ll
get interested" characterized
many residents attitudes towards
the discussion or improvements.
Show the trustees the need, and
we‘ll get the money, Tederman
responded, commenting that the
reports were the best information
on the dorms’ wants he had ever
seen.

Lighting suriaced as a massive
Complaint of which Tederman had
been unaware beiore reading the
reports. Fluorescent lighting was
suggested as a cure tor the present
poor illumination in rooms and
lounges with the mention of adding
rheostats to lights in the lounges,

insulation oi pipes and windows
could belaccomplished easily,
according to the Dean. Fiberglass
enclosure ot pipes would not be too
costly. Windows will be a con»
tinuous replacement project at an
expense or $47,000 next year.
Aluminum, insulated, sidee
paneled storm windows will be put
in Cleveland, James, and Mears.
The “unique Windows” ln Mears
will be kept. The entire campus is
scheduled to have new windows by
approximately 5 years, keeping
heat in and keeping noise out. To
further reduce noise, Tederman
suggested bringing in a sound
expert. An expert could make an
evaluation or the noise problems to
gire a picture or the best use oi
noise insulators.

in long range planning, Dcan

Tederman tossed out the idea of.’

closing an entire dorm or iloor
during a semester ior complete
repair of the walls and painting.
This would require a student
“trade off” agreeing to fewer
available rooms (or the sake of
reconditioning dorms. This sort of
repair can‘t be accomplished
during during the summer without
delaying other major projects and
because of vacation time of B 8: G
which cuts into the actual summer
working time available,
Tederman summed up the
results commenting that he was
encouraged by the reports which
highlighted “some very specific
things to be done.” Those items
would be picked up to be presented
by the new dorm committee for
ming to the trustees for financial
support. '

degrees

The Faculty Committee sub-
mitted names tor the conierring of
honorary degrees while tabling one
other name until the Executive
Council takes action on it. in ad-
dition, partial plans tor the up
coming presidential coronation
ceremony were established.

The name tabled was that of ~

Fernando Flores, a Chilean
economist who is presently in-
carcerated in his native country
Flores' name was submitted by
Richard McLaughlinand Ron
Yang upon the‘urging of various
student organizations includlng the
Third World Study Group, the
Christian Fellowship and the Latin
American House.

Flores, an innovator of the use oi
computer Ltechnology in state
economic 'planning, was a member
of the Allende cabinet and was
jailed aitg‘; the government was
overthrown:

The discussion locused on the
[act that names Submitted for
honorary degrees must first be
referred to the Executive Council.
Some faculty members also
questioned the legitimacy ol
awarding a degree in absentia.
Yang voiced no objection to lure
warding Flures’ name to the
Executive Council, which was
eventually done, as long as there
was faculty debate on the matter.
Yang also suggested that the
iaculty ofier the degree to Flores
while leaving open the question oi
whether he would be able to accept
the award. Yang then defended the
proposal by stating that other
Chilean political prisoners have
been released because ol similar

recommendations
The Flores proposal brought to

the iloor the problem oi the
faculty’s inability to initiate degree
recommendations and how they
are bound to names presented by
the Executive Council and the
Board of Trustees. Some iaculty
members were unclear about the
rules concerning ,awal'ding
honorary degrees.

The iaculty received the names

tor the conierring of honorary
degrees as submitted by iaculty
chairman Arnold Adelberg. Some
iaculty members were hesitant to
give immediate approval to the
names submitted since they were
uniamiliar with the candidates.
However, after Adelberg
reassured thc iaculty. the meme
bers agreed by a nearly unanimous
