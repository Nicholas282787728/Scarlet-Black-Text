Gary Cooper has suiiered irom a
nearly universal tendency oi later
Studean to embroider the un-
dergraduate careers of famous
alumni. In the interest oi Truth,
therefore, the Scarlet and Black
has undertaken to strip away the
veil of rumor and reveal the {acts
ol Frank (as he then was) Cooper's
sojourn here.

There was a lot ol space ior
gossip to fill Cooper was working
his way through school, a state oi
affairs which left him little time to
do anything else but study, He has
written, “I wasn't a ‘loner’ exactly,
but I was older by three years than
most at the kids In my classes."

He was not only a grmd, though,
He was a member of one of the
oldest um) and most prestigious
oi the several literary soclcties,
Chrcstomathia. He tried out for,
and was not cast in, plays, He drew
sketches and cartoons for several
campus publications, since he
intended to be a professional
cartoonist. (It was his inability to
make a living at this which forced
him to take a job as a walkrdn
cowboy.) He spent a lot of tllnc at
the home of the town artiste, the
photographer Child whose house
(now the residence of the Cleaver
Iamilyl was a gathering place [or
the literary and artistic set of both
town and college in the early
twenties. One of the attractions, of
Child’s gatherings, other than the
conversation, was the bathtub gm
he served, distilled literally in a
bathtub, which IS still in use in the
upstairs bathroom of the house
ithere Is no plaque).

It may be this last activity which
has resulted in Cooper’s present

remember that during my lirst
semester 1 got a job wtjrking [or a

sweet cider hc scrvcd at iaculty
getrtogethers, and one of my
chores was to go through his or

to run through his cidcrprcss. I cut
him in ior three gallons out or

‘splllage' ior a senior chemistry

never forget the impact ol that
applejack as it went down.
Otherwise my academic lite at‘
Grinncll was uncxciting "

Cooper has also acquired a
reputation as a rough, western
type, having been, It is said,
nicknamcd “Cowboy Cooper.” I-Ie
nurtured this image later, it is
true, as when he wrote, “Josiah
Grinnell though he had discovered
the WCst in Iowa. .. I though I had
discovered the East in Iowa in
iszl,” Although he was irom
Montana, he was no cowboy, iii-
dced, the ranch that his father had
started on retiring from the
Montana Supreme Court, oi which
he had been justice, was a iailure.
Cooper himself had attended, with
his brother, a public school Dun-
stable, in England. lor three years
He also had been an art student at
two Montana Colleges beiore he
moved east,

Contrary to general lore, Cooper

neither flunkcd out nor was eXr
pelled. In 1924 the ”exigencies of
life” scnt lllm back to Helena and
ultimately to Southern California,
With his family. His memories of
Grinnell were good. however In
1930, already a star, hc contributed
a piece called ”The College I
Love" to the magazine College
Humor lwhich was edited by a
Grinnell alumna who had also been
an hahitucr of Child’s parties). In
this article he wrote, “I wouldn't
trade that two years I spent in
Langan Hall at my alma mater
forrwell for a good many things
that the world seems to set a high
price upon .My only regret is that

regret so muchialthnugh I would
have prized a Crinncll shccpskin
as lnllch as the llcxt fcllow—but the
loss of two years of association
with men whom I had come to
know as brothers " . .

Cooper emerges, then, as a quiet,
unillustrious Student, not far dif-
ferent from the run of the mill then
or now The resemblance is

When the J I3, Grinnnells moved
west, so did the Indians When the
iirst portion oi Iowa land was
ceded to the white men by the
Blackhawk Purchase in 1332 the
red man had to abandon his home.
Among those signing was a
lllesquakie Indian chiel whose
name was Powcshiek.

Although Poweshiek was driven
from his birthplace by the whites.
he was never a man bitter to that
encroaching race. Colonel
Williams arrived at Powcshiek’s
village soaking wet irom rain to
receive warm hospitality. “They
treated us very iricndly, gave us
sugar to eat in abundance, and
their pipes and tobacco to smoke."

Chief ineshiek today lends his
name to the county in which
Grinnell is located In his own day,
he was neither the greatest nor the
most obscure of the Sac and Fox
tribe Dutranked and over-
shadowed by Kcakuk, Poweshiek's
tame and virtue was in his
respectability, as he claimed lirst
rank around tribal council fires
and signed treaties at the top with
the other prominent Incn.
However, Wapello often preceded
Poweshiek in prominence despite

til
it

Chief Poweshiek

\‘l’apello's lower statlls and their
friendship. .

The respect Poweshiek com-
manded stemmed from such ins;
cidents as the time when a horse
was missing irom a nearby set-
tlement. The owner, who suspected
the thief to be an Indian in
Poweshiek's camp, approached
Poweshiek with the suspicion. The
camp was immediately sealed oil
until Poweshiek had searched it,
recovered the missing horse, and
penalized the thief.

The biography of Poweshiek is a
tale of the white conquest Born in
I797 in a Fox village in Iowa, his
Iiie was a story oi “friendly conr
taCIs with traders and government
agents, treaty negotiations for the
cession of tribal hunting grounds,
and Irequent removals or his
village westward belore the press
of insatiable Settlers "

In the prime oi manhood,
Poweshlek weighed two hundred
lilty pounds, towering moun-
tainllke in his massiveIIESS. His
appcarance olten was described as
savage, I-Iis savageness was
probably more apparent in his
mental outlook, though, than in his
physical appearance. A man oi
war, Poweshlek declared to an
Indian agent, “We do not want to
learn, we want to kill Sioux, The
Great Spirit made us to light and
kill one another when We are a
mind to,” Slightly belligerent,
arrogant, blunt, outspoken, slow to
arouse, cncrgctic, and hard to
Control when motivated to action,
these qualities definitely portray a
savage darker side to [lie chiel. In
contrast, he was noted to have a
strange passion tor justice
abundant gratitude, and truth»
fulness.

The strength ol his principles
shows In his defiance of Governor
Chambers and Keokuk over the

sale or the tribal land in Iowa.
While Keokuk had agreed to sell all
the land to the Governor, including
land willed to a iamily oi a close
white lrlend ol the lndlans.
Poweshiek refused. The land was
returned to the family and
Poweshiek was satlsiied.

Poweshiek was never to be
satisfied with his land again,
however, alter ‘Iowa became a
territory In 1336. He and his tribe
wandered westward through Iowa
lading west as the white man’s
shadow advanced over the
territory. Theirmlgration led irom
the west bank oi the Mississippi to
Johnson County to Poweshiek
County trailing into Jasper County,
eventually moving lro stream to
stream across the pral es ol Iowa.
The long journey away irom Iowa
ended in Kansas.

Powcshlek had known many
homes, each In turn to be settled by
the advancing pioneers occupying
the leriile iarmland lowa was
rapidly bclng settled. On July 4,
loall lowa became a territory. In
Johnson County that day a number
of persons were gathered fm‘ a
celebration. Among them was
Chiei Poweshlek. He rose to his lull
stature and pointed west.

“Soon I shall go to a new home
and you will plant corn where my
dead slcep. Our towns, the paths
we have made, and the llowers we
love will soon be yours. I have
moved many times and have seen
the white men put his [eat in the
tracks oi the lndlan and make the
earth into holds and gardens, I
know that i must go away and you
will be so glad when I am gone that
you will soon target that the meat
and the lodgerfirc oi the lndian
have been ior-ever free to the
stranger and at all times he has
asked ior what he has ioughi lor,
the right to be free."
