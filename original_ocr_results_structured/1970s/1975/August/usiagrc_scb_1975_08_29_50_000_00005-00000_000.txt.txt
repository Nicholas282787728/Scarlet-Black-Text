Farm tours

a ’success’;

efreshing,
educational

by Doug Schulz

Whether from an intense curiousity or from a
casual lack of something to do, about 80 or 85
students and some administrative personnel
toured threelocal farms last Sunday during New
Student Days (NSD). An overwhelming majority
seemed excited and pleased with their day’s
experience.

Besides the large turnout, NSD co-chairman
Bruce Schlesinger and several other students
called the tour “a success" because it gave them
a clearer understanding of a way or life com-
mon to a majority of Grinnell residents and ,
different from their own.

Asked why she and her triends toured the _
farms, senior Judy Eivlin said, “We‘d been in
Iowa for three years and never been to a larmﬂi

The tour illustrated three types at local rarm
operations: two general farms planted in corn
and soybeans, and a dairy iarm. Hosts {or the
tour were Robert and Helen Renaud, Gordon and
Mary Haworth, and Maynard and Eloise Rai-
fety. All three couples are active in community
affairs.

The Renauds have a 510 acre farm in corn and
soybeans, plus 90 beet cows. They have two sons:
Scott, age 13. and Brent, age 11. The Haworths
oWn a large farm Di 1,200 acres with 1.100 acres
in corn and soybeans. They have two children;
Andrea, age 3, and James, age a. The Rail‘etys,
both graduates ot Grinnell, are dairy iarmers
with 47 cows and 13 heifers, The Ralfetys have
four daughters: Carla and Janet attend college.
Marilyn. who is in tenth grade, and Sara, in
eighth grade.

Led by Gordon Braley, Executive Director of
the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation
Service or Poweshiek County. the tour group
contained a wide variety of people, from (resh-
men to seniors, from those Whose farming ex-
perience was none at all or only a kindergarten
iield trip, to those who knew a good deal more.
included in the group were President A. Richard
Turner and William Deminol'l', direcmr of
college relations.

Questions discussed on the tour ranged irom
biology to politics, irom generalities such as
questions about average yield per acre, to
specifics on breeding and pollination oi corn.
Questions concerning the severe June to August
drought yielded such facts as:

—The soybeans are only half as high as they
should b

—lllinois will be the top corn producing state
this year instead or lowa.

llelcn Renaud, Gordon Braley, and Robert Renaud answcr questions
irom students of both ul'bnm‘l and rural backgrounds about how an acntal

Iowa corn and soyhean iarm works.

Kathy Kramer and Scott Hunt, seniurs. said
that one or the things which impressed them
most was the amount of work {arming requires,
sometimes 12 to is hours per day. Mr. Renaud
conceded that farmers just don’t have enough
time to know everything that they should about
their business on a national level in terms of
politics. Producing the amount oi food that is
demanded of them keeps them too busy. “Mr.
Ford knows very little about the farmer’s
problems and farmer’s know very little about
national problems." commented Mr. Renaudl

The Renauds, Haworths, and Raffetys are
busy like most other farmers. However. they are
unlike 90 per cent of their colleagues because
they are “progressive" farmers in that they
practice soil conservation. According to Braley,
only about lo per cent of all iarmers practice soil
conservation. Averaging 600 acres, the Renaud,
naworth, and Rafiety farms are also larger than
the Poweshiek County average or 265.

Kramer and Hunt were also impressed that,
despite the tamilies youth, they had extensive
knowledge oi what they were doing and what
needed to be done to maintain. produce and
harvest a-large tarmi “It’s a totally different
kind of knowledge," Scott explained.

Not only Was their trip an educational ex
perience, but sensual too. After biking (about 25
