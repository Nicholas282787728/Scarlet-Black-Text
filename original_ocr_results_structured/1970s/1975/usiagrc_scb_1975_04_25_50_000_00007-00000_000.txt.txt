Pizzas
for peace

To the Editor:

We, the people of Crazy House
are proud to present Pizzas ior
Peace, 1975, This is a project which
was first done in 1973 by the people
who later went on to found the
house. Basically, this is it. We
make all kinds of pizzas and
deliver them all over campus.

Q Pizzas are $2.00 each and all the

proceeds go to the American
Friends Service Committee
hospitals in Vietnam. In 1973 we
made seventyrfive crusts in an-
ticipation of the sale. This year we
are preparing for at least 200
pizzas, which is the amount we sold
last time. We are depending on you
to break the record again this year.
Please help fulfill a small part of
the real American commitment to
the people of Southeast Asia. Call
us tomorrow night at extension 243
and order a pizza (we‘ll also
deliver to the Pub), and it you have
some time, come over to Crazy
House at 1205 Park to lend a hand.
Any contribution you can make in
terms of time or money will be
greatly appreciated. We need to
sell loads of pizzas because we
couldn’t get any money irom
Initiative Fund, who declared this
a “direct Contributmn to
‘charity' ”. Rather, we look at it as
a small and practical part or our
obligation to the Vietnamese which
we can fulfill.

Thank you in advance for what
we know will be a great sale.

-—Cl'azy House

PS, All the onions were donated

to us by the Fareway Store.
