Gridiron turnout tops

The Grinnell football practice
field is starting to get crowded But
nobody is Worried about it, In fact.
it is a welcome development.

The largest player turnout in
many years was on hand as the
Pioneers began practice for the
1975-76 season one week ago. 54
candidates showed up, and Head
Coach Ed Bowers said he could
not remember a larger number in
his 16 years at Grinnell. Last year
there were only 33 players.

The increase is due mainly to the
small turnover from last year’s
team, which posted a see record.
Only five seniors graduated. There
are also a large number of fresh-
man volunteers this year.

The team has only recently
begun contact drills, and comper
tition [or starting spots will not
begin until next week.

The coaches, however, have
some idea of who the starters will
be, although Assistant Coach
Maurice Hunt said he thought only
quarterback Paul Crane and
runningback Tom Goetz. who
gained over 1,000 yards last
season, were assured of starting
berths right now.

Bowers said he thought the
experienced players had the inside
track in the competition, but added
he thought several freshmen would
make second stringers out of some
veterans. No cuts will be made.

Grinnell will play the same
teams in the same order as last
year, but all the locations have
been reversed. Thus, the Pioneers
have five games on the road and
four at home.

Their toughest games will
probably be the first and third
games of the season, against Coe

With ten seasoned veterans
returning and a good crop of
newcomers, the outlook for the
Women's volleyball team is one of
optimism. The girls are eager to
compete and Coach Donna Meck
looks for the team to perform well
throughout the season.

This is only the second year of
women’s volleyball at Grinnell so
the primary objective of Coach
Mack will be to impart the
necessary skills to the women in
order to mold the players into a
solid unit. The Pioneers play a a»
woman team, so it is crucial that
each player be aware of what her

about executing them properly.

Returning letterwomen for the
Pioneers are Sarah Bennett, Sue
Eiese, Lisa Hopp, Amanda
Newstetter, and Abbi Swanson.

of winning both divisional and
conference titles this year.

in his second year as coach of the
team, Pfitsch welcomes back six
starters from last year’s second

impressive ireshmen, the team
hopes to take the Midwest Con-

The defensive mainstays are two
sophomores. goalie Gary Frumkin
and center fullback Roy
Eichengreen. Frumkin is an allz
conference contender while the
diminuitive Eichengreen received
that honor last year. Having
played together this summer on a
team in the Chicago area, the two
