Women in the reels

by Kathy Kramer

The time has come ior me to say
something about women and film—
two oi my favorite subjects. Spring
break, as everyone knows, is the
time to get to the cultural centers
of America (St, Louis, Topeka,
Chicago. and Fort Lauderdale) to
see all the big ﬂicks before the
Academy Awards are presented.
Being no different irom any other
“with it” student, I hit a few of the
biggiesiLenny (right onl,
Shampoo (very chic), The Four
Musketeers (entertaining7),
Scones irom a Marriage
(Bergmanl), and Lenny (again).

All of the films were good (worth
my $2.50 or $3.00) and thought-
provoking, Although much has
been said about the sixties role of
women as sex objects, I found
evidence in two recent films that
this stereotype might be changing.
The new mood mood was not found
in Lenny and certainly not in The
Four Musketeers (the word sexist
does not begin to convey the cheap
way women were portrayed in this
iilml. A new aspect oi females
functioning in relationships can be
seen in Shampoo and Sccncs room
a Marriage. in both cases, iemales
were, in the opening scenes,
submitting to a malevdominated
love life. The boyfriend or husband
seemed to control his own life and
the life of the female also, with her
accepting his iniluence. The males
in each film had affairs or other
sexual interludes, while the
females remained faithful to their
lovers,

The outcome or each relationship
is where the woman’s role is
changing. Alter reacting as the
passive, manipulated. trusting
iemale throughout thc relation-
ship, the woman gains strength

after rejection by her man. The
man then expresses a great need
ior the woman, and asks ior
forgiveness, even after all his
antics. The woman, instead or
submitting to his wishes once
again, chooses the solution most
beneficial to her. With the con-
clusion of the relationships comes
the real strength oi the female.

The initial portrayal oi the
woman is not as liberated as the
great characters oi Bette Davis,
Greta Garbo. and Katherine
Hepburn. But in the finality, the
modern heorine emerges stronger
than her male counterpart. She
reasserts herseli over the abuses
that the imposed malerfemale
roles have subjected her to.

The iilms are not, i think, sup
posed to be feminist statements or
prophetic commentaries. They are
only delving into the complexities
oi the male-female relationship.
But the conclusions of the films can
give women more coniidence about
their own strengths, and encourage
other movie makers to stop ex-
ploiting all humans and attempt to
depict males and iemales more
honestly.

by Jeffrey Miller

One of the more discussed ex-
periences here at good old Grinco
has been the eight-credit
Humanities program. Following
Dean Eysenbach's gentle
reminder that people who didn't
take the courses this semester
would develop large open sores in
unusual places, some sixty
students decided to meet for two
hours every Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday afternoon with
veritable paragons oi pedagogy to
discuss great books, philosophies,
and other sources of knowledge of
all that was, is, and ever shall be.
Works by authors such as Hobbes,
Darwin, Kant, and Swiit are read
and discussed until each person in
the class earns a sterling silver
Renaissance Person badge
texquisitely craftedieven the
claspsl) and is able to write a
cogent article for publication in
The New Yorker or Atlantic
Monthly,

Opinions on the courses vary
greatly. Some students ieel that
they are the greatest thing since
individually wrapped cheese
slices; others feel that a course in
landscape architecture in the Gobi
Desert would be twice as in-
teresting and worthwhile. It has
been my experience that the
quality oi the courses varies
directly with the quality oi the
material being read—vii the book is
good, the course is good, and vice
versa, Over break, l was rumr
maging around my neighbor‘s
attic, and while I found neither the
priceless heirloom silverare nor
the ruby and emerald necklace, I
did find several courses, which I
feel would add immeasurably to
the courses, in terms of both interst
and intellectual development,

Dialogues of Darwin and Marx

An interesting compilation oi on»
stage dialogue oi Charles Darwin
and Karl Marx done when the two
noted philosophers pertormed as a
comedy team in the bistros oi
Paris during the mid-1860’s. It
looks like a winning combination
on paper, and irom what their

Pro/egomena to Future Humanities Courses

given the reader in this edition, it
appears to have been a good our
stage pairing. Darwin had a deft
way with gags, and Marx was an
excellent straight man: Darwin:
My dog has evolved so much that
he no longer has a nose, Marx:
Really'! Then how does he smell'!
D: Awfull. . .but seriously, Karl,
he really has evolved to the point
where he can actually talk. M: —
don’t believe it. D: It‘s true7
yesterday I asked him what two
minus two was and he said
nothing!

This light witty banter continues
throughout most of the book. There
are embarrassing moments,
thoughiusually occurring when
the two switch roles and Marx, who
lacked Darwin's gift of Comedic
timing, fumbles with the punch line
in a somewhat heavyrhanded
manner, causing the act to fall flat
on its tushy: Darwin: 1 don’t
knowiwhy does a iireman wear
red suspendersl Marx: To show
his ideological contempt for the
imperialist bourgeois society that
enslaves him!!

it is at moments like this that one
Wishes that Darwin would have
developed a solo routine, However,
these moments are few and far
between, and on the whole, Nietz-
che’s presentation of this material
gives us a look at an important but
neglected side oi these two great
men and their philosophies,

Our Universe (Oura Universal
tby Laslo Kohoutekl

‘Galileo es nn iaggotto. e
Newtoni gotta intelligensa del duo
mozzarella pizza.‘ So begins the
introduction to this controversial
book supposedly written in 1739 by
iamcd ‘gypsy astronomer' Laslo
Kohoutek, a direct ancestor of the
discoverer of the comet Kohoutek.
Kohoutek discounts the work of
such famous astronomers-

8&8

iounded ion

physicists as Galileo, Newton,
Kepler, and l-lalley as being the
work of “hermaphroditcs,
spastics, and Presbyterians” and
projects his own theory or univeral
structure, According to this theory,
the center of the universe is located
in a yam iield some twelve miles
southeast ot Zagreb, Yugoslavia.

‘ Stars are but the ascended souls oi

dead ltalian recorder players,
whereas planets are alien
spacecrait ready to attack the
earth, which is protected only by
the sun and the moon. Comets and
meteors are weapons of the planets
which so far have been deﬂected
by the protective sun and moon.

Several scholars have
questioned the authenticity of the
Kohoutek work, citing apparently
anachronistic phrases such as
‘Ritza crackers’, ‘Narrato del
Rodda Serling’, and ‘Jacuzzi
whirlapool bath’. However, these
scholars are probably incorrectly
translating Kohoutek's difficult
idiomatic sentence structures and
should not be taken too seriously
yet, All things taken into account,
this is a fine book for anyone in-
terested in examining the iinal
result of the scientific revolution of
the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries and the precursor of the
scientiiic technology responsible
for Space Food Sticks, the
Motorola Quasar, the Jefferson
Starship, and iurther explorations
oi space, the final irontier.

Next Week, we Shall discuss
some other rare tomes discovered
in the neighbor's attic, including
Charles Darwin’s Jonathan
Livingston Beagle. Thomas
Hobbes' book Valley of the Trolls-
A Sovereign State, Molicre’s
Tummy (which should be studied
with the opera) and Marquis de
Sadcha Noble Savage, edited by
Jean-Jacques Rousseau.
