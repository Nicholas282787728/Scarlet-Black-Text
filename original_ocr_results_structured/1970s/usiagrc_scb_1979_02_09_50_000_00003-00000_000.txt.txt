Slimmer face-lift for Norris

by Andrew Schultz

Norris Hall is due to receive a
new “skin.” anothcr floor. and
interior renovations \Vith work
beginning this summer, Vice-
Provost Kenneth Browning said.

Browning said there would be
three areas at renovative work to
be done on Norris, Thc first work
will be giving the hall o new
energy efficient “skin" or exterior,
he said

At present, Norris suffers irom
poor insulation and design inet‘r
ficiencies which make It difficult to
keep heat in the building. To deal
with this problem, Browning said a
new sheathing consisting of brick
and stone will be constructed on
the building.

Also, new, better insulated
windows will replace the present
panes although there will be little
reduction of the “picture window”
style oi the glass.

A second area of renovation is
the construction of a fourth floor,
Browning said this floor will

‘ prowde housing space for some
40 students. This will partially

 

nflset the loss iii space resulting
when Mears is no longer used as a
dormitory. Browning said. adding
the fourth ﬂoor ol Norris will be
essentially the same in form as the
three floors below it

The third action planned on
Norris is renovation to make the
dormitory “more amenable to 607
ed living,” he said. Interior work,
ior example, will be done to alter
the bathrooms from their present
locker room style to a mode allow--
ing more privacy.

He said, work will also be done to
improve the heating system and to
cut down on noise problems.

This summers work will include
all of the exterior “skin" Work and
the construction oi the super-
structure ior the fourth floor,
Browning said Work Will cease
completely on the dorm by the
start of the fall semester, he said.
Then, the next phase will pick up
again the following summer.
Browning said that no major work
which could disturb student living
Conditions would be done during
the school year.

The plans for the Norris
renovations were recently sent
back to the drawing board for some
technical revisions and new
drawings will hopeiully be
availahlc for public vicWing in the
, near luture. Browning said

The renovativc work on
dormitories began last

the
year

.lollowing a 1977 housing study.

Besides ore-20th century Mcars
Cottage llaatii, all oi the dor-
mitories except Loose, Younker.
Cowlcs and Norris were built bet-
ween 1905 and 1920 Younker,
Cowles and Loose were built in the
1940's, and Norris was built in 1959,

“We're doing more for student
lite and comtort than the report
suggested,” Browning said. To
date, Clark and James have been
renovated, and Main Hall’s

_renovation will be completed by

early summer. he said Every
dorm will be renovated according
|0 a schedule that alternates work
between the campuses.

“You learn a little bit from each

 

experience. but it’s gone well so
far," Browning said,

SA ’s: patience, skills needed

by Bob Mitchell

An ideal applicant for student
adviser would have “Godlike"
qualities, says Janet Carl,
associate dean of Student Affairs.

“We are'looking for people who
have some natural skills in relating
to people~helping them or being
able to assess what’s going on with
an individual,” she said. “We are
looking for people who can act
responsibly."

SELECTION OF NEXT year's
SA‘s is going on this week. with
meetings being held last Wed
nesday and Thursday at Which the
selection and training processes

for SA’s were described.

Fiityrftve students have applied
to be SA’s tor next year, while 130
people applied for the position last
year. Carl said. The application
deadline is next Friday.

THOSE INTERESTED in be-
coming an SA must fill out an
application and distribute
evaluation forms to ﬂoormates.
their SA's and resident advisers,
Carl said.

SA candidates then are inter
viewed by a selection committee
consisting of Carl, RA'S Stuart
Drescher and Mike Jay. SA's Jeff
Greenberg and Lisa Lander, and
Student Coordinator Shelley Saruk.

But it the evaluation forms are
overwhelmingly positive, Carl
said, then applicants can skip the
interview.

“Over the years, the counseling
function has been in the ascen-
dant,” Carl said. “When the
students were more heavily into
drugs, SA's were more involved in
crisis intervention and onertorone
counseling,"

BUT NOW THIS role is
changing, she said. with the for-
mation of hall councils. which
consist of SA'S, resident advisers,
hall presidents and hall coors
dinators, there will be “more
emphasis on the floor leadership
min ” she said

We're hoping (hall presidents
and SA'S) will mesh a whole
lot more cticctively than they have
,in the past We’re hoping that
=togetlier these positions can take
isome responsib ~ tor leadership
in the hall 'i she said,

(‘ARI II) THE redefinition of
the SA s role was prompted by
what she perceived as a need tor
grcatcr leadership within the halls

“I think it’s fair to say, and I
heard this from upperaclass
students, that there seemed to be
less oi a community feeling and
less of a respect for individual
rights," she said, adding she
wasn’t blaming the freshmen class
for this

ironically. the closeness
i traditionally assomated with Quiet
l Hall residents may have had some
1 thing to do mm the failure of the
hall to be reorganized last year.
«Both Ruth and Wittpenn agreed
i that last year's organizers missed
l the necessary filing deadlines,
i Ruth believes the real reason for
tthe failure was the belief in lhe
lStudent Aifairs office that the
l residents of the hall had become a
"clique," and the organizers’
tardiness merely provided an
excuse to eliminate Quiet Hall, All
the same, only 27 students iinally
lexpressed interest in continuing
the hall last year.

Holdridge conceded there were
some problems last year in Quiet
Hall. He said these problems
developed when people became
yhesitant to ask for quiet during the
semester, but then “blew up”
tangrily demanding quiet at iinals
ltime.

Holdridge said this was a
communication problem and not a
result of a poor concept of dorm
