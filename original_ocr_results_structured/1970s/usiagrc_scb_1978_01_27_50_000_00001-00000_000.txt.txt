Sought coach’s dismissal ~
Team emerges from period of dissension

by Tom Arcnhere

Shortly before semester break,
at least one dozen basketball
players signed a statement saying
they would not finlsh the season as
long as head coach Art Peterson
remained as coach, the 5&8 has
learned

The statement was signed by
some players active on the team at
that time and by several students
who had already quit the team by
the time of the signing.

However, only two signers who
were active at the time of the
signing quit the team

THERE is now general
agreement on the team that the
situation has greatly improved,
numerous players said.

A number oi players conlirmed
the iollowing sequence oi events:

On Monday, Dec. 12 at a meeting
of players only, it became evident
for the first time that

Library renovation a

Last Tuesday, Grinnell voters
approved a $390,000 bond issue ior
improvements to Stewart Library,

The proposal received an
overwhelmingly tavorable
response irom within the come
munity as 707 votes were cast in
favor of the bond issue and 123
persons voting against it. A 60 per
cent “yes” vote was needed for
passage of the proposal,

NEW benefits for the library will

 

include a remodeled entranceway
which will eliminate the present

ramp and elevator which will also

and fire exits,

Other benefits will be the ad-
dition of a Grinnell Room to
preserve historic materials and a
public meeting room on the
presently unused third floor, a
single area for the children's
collection and activities, a youth
area, study carrels in the mez-
zanine, the enlargement oi the
present public restrooms, a vene
tillation system, and parking in the
rear oi the building.

ADDITIONAL improvements
will appear in study areas. seating,
library display space, and
workroom space. Also included is
the restoration of the fireplaces
and the repair oi one wall which
has separated slightly from the
edifice Drainage will be corrected
in order to eliminate water
problems at the lower level,

Throughout the planning of the
improvements, the Library Board
was careful to retain the building‘s
existing architectural character.

THE library, entered in the
National Register oi Historic
Places in 1975, was built and given
to the City of Grinnell by Joel and
Anna Stewart in 1902. The
Congregational Society donated
the land for the sight.

Recently, the building was
pronounced structurally sound by
an architectural firm specializing
in the renovation of landmark
buildings. As a result of their
iindings, it was the decision oi the
Stewart Library Board to seek the
improvements needed. by way oi a
bond issue rather uian raze the
existing building.

dissatisfaction with Peterson was
widespread. Athletic Director John
Pfitsch was called into the
meeting and informed about the
players’ unhappiness,

PFITSCH SAID in a later in-
terview that he told the players
that he was surprised and that his
“sympathy was with the coach
first," Rob Eyre, Joe Kingma and
Roger Warner. among others, said
they got the impression from
Pfitsch that he was more sym~
pathetic toward the players and
that reassignment oi Peterson was
possible, “I didn't intend to say
that.” Pfitsch later Commented

Later Monday, the players
voiced their complaints at a
meeting with Peterson. “1 ex-
pressed my surprise that as many
oi them ielt that way as they did,”
Peterson later recalled, “I was
totally unprepared for that kind oi
scene."

LIBRARIAN Virginia Cameron,
although cautiously optimistic,
nevertheless felt that the bond
issue would pass. Site had heard no
negative comments expressed
from citizens and stated that
“We're trying to preserve a
historic building,"

Cameron commented that ap-
proximately fifteen years ago. a
proposal to construct a new
building was heavily defeated.

SHE also added that had this
bond issue been defeated, the

Bond issue pas,
Stewart Library.

Stewart Library Board would
possibly have reworked the
proposal and submitted it again [or
vote at a later date.

Supporters of the bond issue
pointed out that Grinnell’s total
bonded indebtedness is slightly
less than $1.5 million. The
limitation for general obligation
bonds alone is nearly $4 million. An
additional $390,000, they pointed
out, would not injure the city’s
financial status.

TIIE bonds from the bond issue
will be retired after eighteen
years. Taxpayers will pay less
than thirty nine cents per 31,000 oi
assessed valuation per year.

 

SEVERAL TEAM members said
in interviews later that most
players ieit as unhappy alter the
meeting as before. Peterson said
he made no attempt to argue or
change anyone’s mind. Later that
night, some team members drew
up the statement,

Individual and small groups
meetings with Peterson during the
next few days proved somewhat
satisiying for some players and
fruitless for others.

THURSDAY, players met
with Pfitsch to ask for advice on
the next possible step toward
getting Peterson removed and to
present to him a second, less
strongly worded statement drawn
up Wednesday. Pfitsch gave back
the statement, which had fewer
signatures than the irrst. Neither
Plitsch. nor any of the principles in
the affair ever saw the first
statement.

pproved

The Grinnell City Council had
mentioned the possibility of
allocating $50,000 for some library
improvements but it is now
doubtful that they will proceed any
further with that idea.

IN THE past, the library applied
to the Kinney Lindstrom Foune
dation in Mason City, Iowa for
funds but was turned down,

An application was also made to
The Library Support Foundation,
but the maximum grant is small
and Stewart Library had low

priority on that list: Better news
was received from The Division of
Historical Preservation. which
recently announced that it will
provide $11,000 in matching funds
for the library.

An example of the library’s
popularity within the Grinnell
community is demonstrated by the
tact that, during the past twelve
months, nearly 87,000 items were
checked out. The East Central
Regional Library System has
placed its large print books at the
Stewart Library as a result of
heavy use at the location.

Pfitsch called the players’ ac-
tions “blackmail" and “ex-
tortion", and said players should
have a minor role in coach
selection, In a later interview. he
said the words he used were not
‘ accurate and that he did not recall
deemphasizing player role in
coach selection. “Of course there's
a role. Players have been used
before," he said.

PFITSCII ALSO informed the
players that Peterson's contract
had been renewed a few weeks
earlier for two more years, which
disappointed many players.

Dean Waldo Walker said he was
not aware of player unhappiness
when the contract was renewed.
He Said renewal means Peterson
cannot be fired. though
