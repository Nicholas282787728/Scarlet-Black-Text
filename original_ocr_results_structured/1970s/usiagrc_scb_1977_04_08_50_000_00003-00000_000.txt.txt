Morton H, Halperin praised the
Carteradministration ior speaking
out on human rights in other
countries here Monday. but said
the U.S. should work for economic
as well as political rights. ,
Tuesday, Halperin called for the
us. to work to make the
Vladivostok agreementoi 1974 into
a treaty as thetirststepin securing
comprehensive reduction oi
American and Soviet strategic

, arms.

9: Halperin, current director of the
Project on National Security and
Civil Liberties, presented two
addresses in Herrick Chapel as the

“€377 Roseniield Lecturer. Monday,
i alperin spoke on “Morality and
Foreign Policy: Human Rights and
Realpolitik " He spoke Tuesday on
“Abolishing Nuclear Weapons."

On Monday, Halperin, who is
experienced in the iield of ioreign
aiiairs, said the U.S. has
traditionally limited its ioreign
policy concerns to preventing the
spread oi communism and
maintaining open U.S. trade
routes,

. He said the us has an
ﬁligation to speak out on the
human rights practices of other
countries, but said Carter, should
not be concerned only about
ﬁlmed rights, such as the imr

’"sonment of citizens for their.

political beliefs. He said economic
rights, such as ireedom irom
starvation, are equally important,
The U,S, should be Willing to use
delivery of economic aid and
military arms as a tool to promote
rights, he said.

Speaking to a capacity crowd,
Halperin said the 11.8 should
improve on human rights at home.
On economic rights, he scored the
#5 as perhaps one of the worst
0 enders in the world, citing, for
examples, its high iniant mortality

and widespread poverty. He added
that the U.S. does not always
observe political iights. either. He
noted, tor example, that the
Cubans who attempted to
assassinate President Truman are
still in jail 25 years later, a period
longer than most people would
serve ior attempted murder,

Before a slightly smaller crowd
on Tuesday, Halperin said the
recent U.S. arms limitation
proposal to the Sovtet Union,
despite its “junking” oi the
Vladivostok agreement, is
“technically a very good arms
control proposal.” He explained
that it allows every American
program approved by Congress to
continue while requiring the Soviet
Union to dismantle a substantial
number of its existing missiles.

Halperin said the Soviet Union
will not be Willing to make ads
vancements in arms limitations
until the Vladivostok agreement, a
SovietrAmerican agreement
signed in 1974 to limit Strategic
arms, becomes a treaty. Once this
happens, Halperin said, the recent
U.S. proposal and a similar Soviet
proposalmeven one favoring the
Soviets as much as the American
proposal favors the U.S.—could
serve as the bases for future
limitations.

Halperin has spent over three
years in the iederal government.
He joined the Detense Department
in 1966 as a special assistant ior
planning. He then became a deputy
assistant secretary oi deiense in
the Office of the Assistant
Secretary oi Defense, In 1969, he
becamea senior member of the
National Security‘CounciI staff. He-
is also the author or many books
and articles on foreign affairs.

Monday, Halperin Said efforts to
assure human rights abroad should
be concentrated on countries that
already have 'some degree of
democratic values and that are
working tor economic rights. In
addition, the speaker said these
efforts should be directed to those
nations where the U.S. would have
someinfluence He added that;
American human righB efforts
should begin in countries such as
Chile and the Congo where the
movement for rights was stopped
by U. actions. Halperin Cited the
CIA s the main perpetrator oi
such actions and Called for all
covert CIA operations to be
abolished.

He cautioned in the first lecture
that although Carter’s efforts to
assure human rights in the Soviet
Union were good, such eiiorts
should not interfere with the more
important matter of limiting arms.
In the second lecture, he said SALT
should be used seriously to achieve

such limitations.

Halperin said SALT has already
accomplished “the single most
important objective or strategic
arms limitations," the banning oi
antirballistic missiles. He said that
without these missiles, the size and
shape oi other iorces is irrelevant.
However, he expressed concern
that the missile banishment might
he renounced by either side.

The U S., Halperin commented,
practices a double standard by
discouraging development of
nuclear arms in other Countries
while not ruling out the possibility
that the us. may wish to use
nuclear weapons itself. Halperin
said theU.S.; the Soviet Union and
China should Sign a “no firstruse”
treaty By signing this, each
country agrees that it will not be
the first nation to use nuclear
weapons in the event oi war

”Ha‘lp'erin' described “Americans
a's‘havlng a complaceht‘ attitude
toward nuclear weapons He said
people often forget that the nuclear
weapons now in existence are ten
times more poweriul than those
used at Hiroshima and have the
ability'to ehd all liie. They cannot
bwe considered conventional arms,
he stated,

Halperin led a discussion on
Tuesday about the ioreign policy or
the Carter administration He Said
the new administration has
brought changes on “minor
issues,“ but on “big issues, things
have not changed Regardless of
who’s in there, things roll on.
Forces on the bureaucracy are
very hard to overcome."

Speaking out
on civil liberties

Morton H. Halperin, 1977
Roscnlield Lecturer. discussed
1 liberties in an interview Mith
the sari, llalpei'in is director oi the
ject on 'aliollal Security and
I Liberties and is a member or
the American Civil Liberties
Union. Recently, he was awarded
damages in a civil lawsuit against
ex-P‘csident Nixon, ILR.
ll dciiian and John Mitchell fur a
21~month wiretap on his home
phone in 1969-71.

noes your present involvement—
the Project on National Security
and Civil Liberty—deal only with
the liberties of American citizens
or “ith other countries as Well?
Mostly with Americansyso far.
wtiatdoes’nhc ojcét‘do?‘ “
One of the things we've done is try
to use the Freedom of Information
Act to get informatlon about the
intelligence agencies and their
decision-makingprocess . , We've
filed a number of'lawsuits, one of
which is against the CIA fur the
Chaos program. the domestic
spying program oi the CIA. We’ve
also been actively involved in the
question oi national security
wiretapping.

llas Watergate given us a lessnn?
I think it hasn’t given us enough oi
a lesson. 1 think there is a tendency
for us to say the good guys are back
in now and therefore there is still
no threat irom the government, I
think the lesson has been
somewhat taken to heart. but much
less than you might expect.

is thcrc more iniringeiiient or civil
liberties that we don't know about?
I think there is still a lot more
that we don't know about.
Much of it has to do with the
operation oi ioreign intelligence
services in the U.S. We're just
beginning to understand that.
Should the public be involved ill
dealing with infringement of hts
or can it be leit to organ

like the American Civil LI cries
Union?

The only time you’re going to get
real leverage on these issues is
when Congress hears about it irom
the general public,

llow do you iecl Congress is doing

 

as an oversight body? is it doing a
good job?

No . There’s too much secrecy
involved. 1 think Congress is not

‘cfiective, and cannot be effective,

because it has to be secret.
Congress’s oversight function has
come irom publicizmg what is
going on and getting ieedback irom
the public. The public just isn't
directly aiiected by foreign policy,
They can't give the kind ot reaction
that they can ii you’re talking

about interstate highways.

Are Civil liberties and national
security irreconcilable?

No, ldon’t think that's true at all
This is a set oflssues which, in fact,
the courts. the Congress and the
presidents, have‘dealt .with since
’ he founding of the republic . . It
seldom turns out to be the case that
on specific levels there is a real
irreconcilable problem, There are
some times when you have to run
some risks, but I think that in
general you find that there is a way
to meet genuine security needs
without jeopardizing constitutional
rights. The courts have actually
done a good job over the years, in
most cases, ot dealing with this
problem The courts have, in of
feet. treated national security in
general no differently than they
have treated other areas, although
it’s true that in some cases they
have bent over backwards to
arrive at what they view as
politically acceptable opinions in a
crisis , . .sueh as when they let the
Japanese be interred in prison
camps . . , but they did so without
stretching constitutional doctrines.

it you allow tor some inlringenicnt
oirights in some cases. how do you
tell when this allowance has been
abused?

it is important to make sure the
iniringemcnts are not on imr
permissable grounds, do not
discriminate against people on the
basis oi their political beliefs or
political activities. and are not
discriminating impermissably
against particular groups oi
people. As I‘ve said, on the whole,
the courts have done a pretty good
job.
