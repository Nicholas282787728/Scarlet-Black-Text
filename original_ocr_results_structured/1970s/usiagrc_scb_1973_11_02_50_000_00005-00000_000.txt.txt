it Getting News From Home

by Kyle Schauh
ominrnutnamu .

KLAGENFURT, AUSTRiAssCult»
ural shock is already a trite ph-
rase, but its meaning can become
reireshingly clear while visiting a
ioreign land. One particularly hard
lesson to learn is that US news
does not make the front page, orthe
inside pages either. The press pri»
orities are logically mother-couns
try orientated, expanding occasions
ally to include Europe. The US
runs a poor third, but,this fact
can not be too surprising since we
reverse the same priorities back
home. For us, unless bloodhasbeen
spilled, icreign news items in Amer-
ican media are few and far between.
We have also become very spoiled
children of the electronic age; news
is everywhere. We would have to be
dumb and blind or living at Grinn-
ell not to receive the news in one
form or another. The TV, radio,

'newspapers and magazines all but
shove the daily news down many a
reluctant throat which would gladly
spit it up if given half the chance.
Nevertheless, the newsis there when
you want it, easy to understand and
comprehend.
In Europe

We 386958 to news is

irustratingiy complicated for us
Here we can no longer indulge in
our 10 o’clock news habit, we sim-
ply do not-have the Tv or radio
set to abscnt—mindedly turn on. And
if access is iound, then there is
always that persistent language:
barrier problem that we student
linguists are iorevertryingto cross,

“10E Inﬁll/”SILT lit/HEW

However, newspapers remain our
main news source, and wehave cons
sequently learned to play a game oi
hide—andrgorseek with the newspar
per venders when we want to buy
an issue. The rules are simple:
buy the newspaper you think has the
most American stories, in a style
you can read, and at a price youcan
afford. The venders do not take kin
ndly to us picky customers who
rifle through the various editions,
counting which (if any) scandalsheet

has the most Nixon, Agnew and Wae .

tergate headlines, but we manage.
About once a month one of us one
eaks down and buys a treasured
copy oi Newsweek or Time at the
outrageous price oi $1 a copy to
sort out all the rumors we have
gleaned irom the local press has
turally we had to choke back our

guilty ieelings about buying English
language publications that forced us

to read the magazines behludlocked
doors, but now we navereallzed that
the rumor machine just could not
answer all our questions, andmalns
tain our Sanity too.

Our wildest rumor to date was
carefully ilguring out that Agnew
had oiiicially resigned whenKissin-
ger became officially installed as
Secretary oi State mid September.
We were also convinced that the
us, supermarkets had nothing but
barren shelves and that red meat
had joined the ranks of the Dodo
bird.

Beyond these miscalculations, lies
the twilight zone of no information
received at all; is. the wide (mys-
terious) world of American sports

The World Series race is a total '

blank overihere, as well as Hank
Aaron’s chances for breaking Babe
Ruth’s home run record this year,
The football season does not exist
‘and neither will that bonanza 0f
iootball ooglers' delight, New Year’s

Day. We even had to wait to dis-
cover that Ms. Billie Jean King’s
piglet proved mightierthanMr. Bob—
by Riggs’ sucker.

Ah, for a glance at a Des Moines
Register and Tribune to set things
right. We just can not seem to get a
hold of the European edition here.

A ModestL Proposal

(Ed. noteuThis column, heldover

irom the October 19 issue, refers to

the “modest proposal” advanced by

Professor Joseph Wall at the Octo»

ber 15 meeting of the faculty).
by Jack Doppelt

It is a melancholy object to those
who tour this great college or visit
the campus, when they see the clas»
ses, the library, and office halls,
crowded with teachers of the,aca-
demic ilk, surrounded by three,
tour, or six, maybe even five, stu—
dents, all in rags and importunmg
the teacher for advice. Theseteach-
ers, instead of being able to teach
for their honest livelihood, are for~
ced to employ all their time in atv
tending meetings and chairing com-
mittees, all for thepurposeofmak~
ing the school more conducive to
teaching.

I think it is agreed by all parties
that the prodigious number or stue
dents tugging at the collars of their
teachers, and frequently oftbeirad-
ministrators, is ’n the present de-
plorable state 0 the college a very
great additional grievance; and
therefore.whoever could find out
a genuinely switt, cheap, and: easy
method of making these students
soundless, voiceless members of
the community woulddeserve sowell
of the faculty as to have his diploma
hung in the library next to the Mics
key Mouse clock.

I shall now therefore humbly pros
pose my own thoughts, however
borrowed, which i hope will not be
liable to the least objection.

I have been assured by a very
khowmg academlclan that a teach-
er wellrversed in a particular me»
tier is at that mature vintagea most
teachable, studious, and enterpris»
ing person; and I make no doubt,
much more so than a liberal arts
student whose adolescence still V9,
Xes him.

I do therefore cribbingly offer it

to public consideration that oip the
twelve hundred and sixty students,
computed to be attending this coll-
ege, six hundred and thirty be re-
moved from the school annually for
the next two years to be replaced
by prominent, distinguished teacnr
ers from throughout the land who
can not only iunction as students,
but as teachers.of renowned star

The

DOPPELT
Effect

The advantages oi such a proposal

are both numerous and ensuing.
For first, the college would ens
hance its tradition oi graduating
a choice breed of scholars, For
instance, the number of graduates
who proceed on to doctoral de
grees would be incomparably high;
and evidence Of that fact would be
available upon graduation, even
sooner. The departing students of
that initial squad of six hundred
and thirty would be proud oi the
quality of the institution they left
behind.’

Secondly, in very little time, the
teacher/student would becomeaslnr
distinguishable from the faculty as
one teacher irom another, so that
after the brief transitional flux, no
{actions would be discernible at the
college.

Thirdly, because oi the unanimity
oi iunction and purpose, any animOSr
ity and distrust between teachers
and students would dissolve into a
healthy mixture of cooperation. A
teacher returning from London
would not be cast into a battlefield
oi nerves
Fourthly, the circumstance might

be avoidable in which a substantial
sector oi the iaculty stands up age
ainst the wall in open disagreement,
Fifthly, because of their maturity
and insight, the teacher/students
would be capable oi sitting on any
committee, thereby allotting tear
chers more time to teach for their
honest livelihood, Instead ofdividing
committee assignments among a
meager one hundred and thirty res»
ponsible members, the committee
positions would be open to over
thirteen hundred options. Any ec»
onomist could expound on the bene-
fits of depreciating the average
number of hours a teacher spends
on committee business.

Sixthly, the departing students wo-
uld be available to fill necessary

bastions in society without a tour‘

year delay.

Many other advantages might be
enumerated, but those I omit, being
studious oi brevity,

I can think of no one obyection
that will possibly be raised age
ainst this proposal, but beiore one
is advanced in contradiction to my
scheme, and offering a better, i
desire the author or authors will be
pleased maturely to consider two
points. '

First, as things now stand, what
position at the stump of the totem
pole do the students occupy" And
secondly, what the recent, overs
wneiming vote by the teachers sig-
nifies to students who believe that
the college is mature enough to ale
low them to iully share the responr
sibility of preservmg and ameliOr
rating the college.

1 proiess, in spite of the position
of my tongue, that i have not the
least personal interest in endear
voring to promote this necessary
work, having no other motive than
the community good of my college,
by advancing its reputation, provid—
ing for students, relievmg the tea»

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK NOVEMBER 2, 1973 PAGE FIVE

Questions 0f Succession

by Tom Knapp

Although it now appears that Pres—
ident Nixon will probably survive
his latest fiasco, several indica-
tors point the way to his tenuous
grip on the Presidency. Certalur
1y he could not survive.another
Cox»firing type episode.

First, the recent Mid-east Crisis
seems to point to Nixon’s weakens
ed grasp on the Presidency. His

alert to the military is now seen'

as a sign to Moscow oi his con~
tinued authority. It was to prove to
the Russians that he still had afirm
hand in foreign affairs, This would
hardly have been necessary even
two months ago. While Nixon con-
tinued to assert his independence
as President, his actions would

suggest he felt it necessary to pull
off that rather massive display of
his power. .

Rhetomc
Unlimited

Second, last Friday’s news con-
ference indicated Nixon's weakness
in the presidency. The press, like
vultures, attacked Nixon like he had
been lost on the desert for two
months. Their tone would not have
been so hostile with a President
in firm control. Similarly, Nixon‘s
hostility, acting like the last sol»
dier alive at a beseiged outpost,
suggested he was very much aware
that he was in trouble,

Even so, at present, there are
no concrete grounds for impeachr
ment While a denial of a ‘court
order would have produced an open
and shut case, Nixon’s decision to
surrender the tapes ended it The
only areas now open are ambi-
guous claims of broken promises,
alleged illegal wiretapping, and co—
verlng up oi evidence. Most any
President since Roosevelt could
have been charged on those gro-
unds,

Nevertheless, there is the possi-
bility that a future blunder by the
President will cause him to res
slgn or be impeached and convict-

ed, This brings several greater
problems. it is apparent that Can-
gressman Ford will not be confirm—
ed as VicerPresident (or some time.
Should the Presidency be vacated,
Speaker of the House Carl Albert
would be President. At 65, he is
not too old, but could provide lit-
tle but a caretaker government.
In additionﬁhe would have to bear
tough post-Watergate investigations
into his political and personal life.
Should Albert refuse the Presi-
dency, the next in line would be
PresidentProsTem oi the Senate,
James Eastland oi Mississippi. At
69, he also, is not, by Southern
standards too old, Still he, like
Albert, would face stiff questions
of political morality. A quick look
at the Congressional Quarterly re-
veals typically southern election
returns of 91, 95, and 100% (un—
opposed) victories. There would un—
doubtedly be questions about who
was allowed to vote The point is
that even should either man accept
the presidency, he could be little
more than a figurErhead.

One solution now being discussed
by a few has attractive solutions to
these problems. it is simply that if
the offices of President and Vice-
President were vacated, new elec-
tions would take place, with the
Speaker of the House acting as
President only until the elections,
which would elect a new President
for the. remainder of the four year
term. Of course, there are prob
lems. The constitutionality is am-
biguous. The nomination process
would have to be altered. Perhaps
the party national committees could
nominate 2 or 3 men for the party
members to vote on in a primary,
with the winners being the Candi»
dates ,in the national elections. In
this way, the entire process could
take perhaps six weeks. The point
is, that for long periods of time
this country needs more than elder
statesmen acting as caretakers.

of course, a situation such as we
now find ourselves in may not naps
pen for another two hundred years.

'Nevertheless, an alternate method

for choosing leaders should be dis—
cussed ln the national forum A
direct method Such as this deserves
consideration. ‘

Keyboards Shine
On‘Dead Album

by itick Faust

Time now for a complete review
of Wake of the Flood, the Grateful
Dead’s latest album.

The most recent studio efforts
by members oi the band had been
solo albums by Jerry Garcia (Gar-
cia) and Bob Weir (Ace). Ace was
much more of a commercial suc-
cess than Garcia. This‘, coupled
with the fact that Garcia had assu—
med a more subdued role in con-
certs, led some people to believe
that Bob Weir would have a lot
more to say about the music in
the future.

However, Wake of the Flood is
almost strictly the work of Jerry
Garcia. only two songs, “Let Me
Sing Your Blues Away” and “Wear
ther Report Suite” are not Garcia
compositions (they are written by
Keith Godchaux and Bob Weir, res-
pectively).

If there is one word that best
describes the album, I think it
would be ”subtle.” Wake/of the Flood
doesn’t immediately blow one away
like Workingman’s Dead,but instead
works on you slowly, Side one opens
ments contributes some fine violin
to the cut.

Keith Godchaux makes his vocal
and writing debut on the next cut

THOSE OBNOXIOUS
DEADLINES

Please remember that infor
mation on upcoming events ex—
pected to appear in the Scarlet
and Block must be in our hands
by 5 pm. Tuesday prior to
Friday publication.

Letters to the editor and want
ads must be in our hands by
5 pm. Wednesday. please help
yourself , observe the dead-

with “Let Me Sing Your Blues'
Away” which sounds like theDead’s _
tribute to Junior Walker and the
All—Stars. (By the way, the sax
player is Martin Fiend). Two fine
Garcia songs close out the side --
“Row Jimmy” and “Stella Blue.”
”Row Jimmy” exemplifies the real
delight of the album, and that is
the excellent keyboard work ofKeith
Godchaux On this cut he shows that
he knows how to use an electric
piano very tastefully. Garcia be—
comes a balladeer on ”Stella Blue"
is and a very nice one at that.

“Here Comes Sunshine,” the first
cut on Side Two, is highlighted by
the keyboard work of Godchaux, ex-
pecially in its ascending chorus.
The most danceable music on the
entire album is heard on “Eyes
of the World ” Winding up the al»
bum is “Weather Report Suite.”
It‘s a three section tune by Bob
Weir. it begins with “Prelude,”
an acoustic guitar introduction by
Weir. Next comes “Part1," which
is a ballad in the vein of songs
like “It Looks Like Rain" on Acet
The concluding section, ”Part II
(Let it Grow)” has a big band type
sound, featuring some more fine
sax licks by Martin Fiend.

Once again,Wake oi the Flood is
an album that‘sneaks up on you.
And it you want the maximum eff—
ect of the album, play it loud! I
think you’ll be surprised at the
pleasant difference volume makes
on Wake of the Flood.

also, keep at least one ear lis-
tening to the fine keyboards oi
Keith Godchaux. He has, like pia-
nist Chuck Leavell has done with
the Allman Brothers, added a new
dimension to the music oftheGrate-
ful Dead ,, a brand of music that
is already multirdimensional.
