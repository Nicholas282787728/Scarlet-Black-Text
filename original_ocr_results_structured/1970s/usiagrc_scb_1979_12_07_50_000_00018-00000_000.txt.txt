Lullaby

Lullaby for a silent night—
The murmur of summer rain.
Lying still

As the sound of each drop
Echoes in your mind.

Gently carried away;

Floating through the dark,

Past unicorns and carousels,

Round northern lights and the
midnight sun.

Drifting into the sunrise,
Awakening to the purple dawn
of another day.
Remembering. . .
The lullaby
Ofa silent night.

Summer Fever

A rose at night/all
Fading into a painted sunset
Oi muted pink,
Watercolors across the summer sky.
Somewhere a cricket chirps.
The grass rustle-s
As the Wind ripples through
The midsummer fever.
Pale moon rising
A5 glimmering stars illuminate the
serenity.
Vou handed me a flower;
Then,
A touch
A smile
As we melted into the heat.
—Eva Baroth

Pastoral

Mosaic of memories

Scattered through the brown
summer grass

Of a country‘afternoon.

Rusted hinges

Falling from rotted wood

To the ground below.

Weathered posts

Bare of barbed wire—

Home for the flourishing weeds.

Deserted farmhouse

With a window someone forgot to
close;

The arid wind blowing through,

Raising the dust of decades.
Blue shy
Bright sun

The only observers. ’
—Eua’Baroth
