30 Day Rufe Goes

by John Wylie

Philosophy instructor Thomas Davis, whose lawsuit challenging the lows
aovday residency requirement lor voting was tiled last Thursday in Polk
County District Court, appeared today to he on the verge of a victory that
would overturn the controversial residency requirement ior all newly

arriving Iowans.

Iowa Secretary or State Melvin n. Synhorstt tiled an otter to Confess
Judgement Wednesday which stated that he would notenforce the residency
requirement against any new resident oi the state.

Exact language oi the proposed court order to overturn the residency
clause was being dehated yesterday in the State Capitol.

Suit was filed after the new In-
structor, who moved into Iowa on
August 23, realized that he wouldbe
unable to vote in Tuesday’s Grinv
nell School Board election. Davis,
whose eightryear old daughter ate
tends school in the Grinnell—
Newburg District, mentioned his
problem to iellow iaculty members
at a get acquainted party, and added
that he would be willing to pursue
the matter in the courts.

He was contactedseveraldayslater
by Des Moines ACLU attorney Dan
Johnston, who filed the class action
suit on his behalf, claiming that
Davis’s constitutionally guaranteed
ireedom oi movementwns being vio-
lated by the Iowa law.

Cited as a legal precedent in the
proceeding was the Tennessee case
of Blumfield versus Dunn, whichwas
finally decided in the United States
Supreme Court. That decision held
that residency requirements could
not be used to bar an otherwise eli-
gible elector from voting in a na
tional election.

Schwengel Discusses Campaign

by Don pagenais
and Curt Gorrell

Coffee. donuts, and an informal
chat wtth Republican Congressman
Fred Schwengel were the first or-
der of business for 5813 political
reporters on Saturday. September
2. Schwengel iielded questions posed
by Sire interrogators at a relaxed,
early morning coiiee hour hosted
by Assistant Professor of Theater
Bruce Halverson.

Schwengel, [or 16 years a member
oi Congress, is in a tight race
for the Congressional seat for the
first district of Iowa with Edward
Mezvinsky, a iormer iowalegis»
lator. “I'm Just sure,” Schwengel
told the SELB, “that students hav»
en’t made up their minds,” lie
hopes that the campuses will be a
focal point in the campaign, he
feels that his visit to the University
of Iowa campus on September 1
was very “well-received” and that
he perceived “an nntirRepubiican
leehng there, hut not one of anti-
Schwengel."

“My opponent is making age the
issue,” he observes 0f the pre
sent campaign. “I believe that ex-
perience is the issue.” He noted
that many people believe that Nixon
will be reselected, and he believes
that he could have more inﬂuence
with a Nixon administration than
Mezvinsky Could.

Schwengel emphasizes his ex-
tensive involvement in Con—
gressional service and his long
time commitment in areas such
as pollution control, his opposi-
tion to the seniority system in Con-
gress (“Yes It will changel”), and
his successful tights against ”big
truck” hills and the prayer amend-
ment. He is also opposed to all
U S. involvement in Indochina. “My
opponent calls iol- change,” he obs

cision, Iowa officials had originally
planned two sets of ballots for the
November General election - oneset
showing only Presidential and Vice
Presidential candidates, the other
with the full complementoinational,
state and local candidates listed.
Taken by Surprise

Davis was unaware oia DesMoihes
Register story which appeared yes-
terday morning which indicated that
the case had been settled. He did
not learn of the partially erroneous
report until he reached his Des
Moines Attorney's office laterinthe
morning,

Contrary to the Register account,
the final wording of the court order
was still at issue late Thursday,
although there seemed to be agenc»
ral agreement in principle about
striking downtheresidency require-
ment.

As a class action suit, the final
decision will aiiect not only Davis
but any person movingintotowaless
than thirty days prior to a local or
state election.

REPRESENTATIVE FRED

serves, ”but I’ve been a leader for
change."

Schwengel notes that only 29,000
U.S. troops remain in indochina,
none of them in Combat. He re-
affirms his concern over the war,
and says that he takes ,
every opportunity to keep pressure
on the State Department.” The im»
portani lever, he realizes, is Henry
Kissinger~“but one can't get to
Kissinger."

The Congressman directed com-
ments at two prominent iigures in
the Nixon Administration, Vice
President Agnew and Secretary or
Agriculture Enrl Butz. Agnew, in
Schwengel’s opinion, weakens the
Republican ticket in Iowa. He finds
an “antagonistic feeling" towards
Agnew, particularly on college cam-
puses where he suspects that as
large a iigure as 80% or the stue
dents, Republicans as well as Dem,
ocrats, are opposed to Agnew.
Butz, on the other hand, has her

with student representatives from

Central College, Cornell, Drake,
lowa State, the University oi lowa,
Simpson and William Penn in the
debate and formulation of ISPIRG
policies and in decisionsmaking on
organizational questions.

Perhaps the most important aspect
of the board meeting was the in-
clusion of “Awareness Sessions”.
These were informal, but informar
tive, seminar sessions, designed,“
lSPIRG's Executive Director John
Neubauer told the student board
members, “To make you aware of
problems in all areas so you can
balance priorities."

The featured guests includedJudge
Leo Oxberger, Louise Nun re-
presenting the lCLU, Eboberbillig
from the Legal Aid Society, and
Maurice Van Nostrand, Chairman of
the Iowa Commerce Commission.
These people brought no speeches;
rather they sat down with small
groups oi students, discussed probe
lems and their concerns in their
respective fields of work, and an-
swered questions raised by the
ISPlRG reps. These sessions, last-
ing two hours, allowed each con—
ference attendant to speak to and
learn from each of the individual
guests, delving into a variety oi
roplcs ranging irom welfare aid to
prison reform.

Mary Jane Wynn, commenting on
these seminars, found that "the
stall is providing us with some legs
itimate yet concerned contacts
within Iowa. The idea of prelimr
inary helping with some of the ale
ready established groups—-Legal
Aid, Commerce Commission, etc.
"where they need the research as-
sistance mayprovide uswitha really
good place for experiementing with
possibilities of fields in which to
work.”

Much oi the lengthy two, dayrlong

lowans, in Schwengel’s view, Heis

“the iirst ilghting Secretary or Ag-
riculture we’ve had [or ten years."
When interviewed at Grinnell last
Spring, Schwengel expressed some
doubts about thc'support of his
constituents fro Butz, who had been
critized for links with corporate
iorming interests now he iinds sup
port ior Butz maniiested in numerr
ous speaking requests tor the Sec-
retary and in bumper stickers he
has seen which read “Elect Nixon
or Lose Your Butz,”

The situation of the farmer, heob-
serves, is now favorable. Although
corn prices are low all other agl-ir
cultural prices are up, and he he
lieves that farmers favor the present
Administration agricultural polls
cies They do not, he thinks, des
sire a change,

Grinnell Grad Gratis Gold

Mark Spitz has nothing on Grinnell It was in the 1924 Olympics
when Morgan Taylor, then ayuniol- at Grinnell College, ran in the
400-meter hurdles and won the iirst gold medal tor the Americans
that year, setting a world’s record with a time oi 52.5. Taylor was
only one oi a series or great Grinnell trackmen in the earlier part
oi the century, hack when Grinnell was a great school ior athletes

as well as for scholars

Grinnell at that time “placed more emphasis on athletics than
it does now," according to Richard G. Ullrich, an Assistant to
the President in the area of Development, and had several Students
who held national and world track records. Morgan, however, was

the greatest of them (ill.

Soon after the Olympics in 19le he ran in an AAU track meet and
set a national record in the dioeyard hurdles oi 754.5, only to hreak
his own mark the following year with a world record of:53.6.
At one time or another in his career, Morgan held a total of five
world records. in the 7Dryard high hurdles, the Mil-yard hurdles,
the Aﬁryard hurdles, the 400-metei‘ hurdles, and the BUryard hurv
dies. His 1924 Olympic success was not the end oi his Olympic
career, either: he is one at the tow men in history to qualify in
three diiierent Olympians (1924728452) in nu event as strenuous as

hurdle running

The days or Grinnell athletic greatness are gone, but in the minds
of many alumni Morgan Taylor still runs, and breaks records.
