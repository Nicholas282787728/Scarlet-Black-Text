Returning to the friendly con-
fines of Darby Pavilion after two
disconcerting defeats at the
William Penn Tournament last
Friday and Saturday, Grinnell‘s
male cageis treated their fans to a
spectacular 7843 upset Victory
over the Redmen of Simpson
College. Grinnell exhibited great
improvement over the cold
shooting and porous defense that
had plagued its efforts in a 76-57
setback at the hands of North
Central and an 33-63 loss to William
Penn.

Senior forward Joe Kingma
scored ten clutch points and
displayed a knack for being in the

right place at the right time.
Freshman frontliner Pat Walsh, a

mean dude under the boards, also

registered ten tallies. Center Matt
Miller hit for 15 pains on 7 for 11
shooting and was a strong force in
the middle of the Pioneer defense.
Sophomore swingman Phil Gutt-
man added 16 poins and grabbed a
phenomenal 14 rebounds. Guard
Frank Orth burned Simpson with
bombs from afar and driving,
twisting layups. He finished as
Grinnell's leading scorer with 25
points.

Grinnell came out blazing,
soaring to a lead of 2242 on the
strength of superb outside shooting
by Miller, Kingma, and Guttman.
Simpson cut the margin to 36-31 at
intermission, but Grinnell
maintained this advantage during
the early minutes of the second
half. Suddenly, however, play
became sloppy and Grinnell found

itself behind [or the first time, 55-
54, It was time for Roger Warner to
go to work,

The diminutive junior guard had
been playing well all evening,
methodically beating the Red
mens’ fullscourt press, directing
traffic, and throwing a blanket
around Simpson’s high~scoring
guard JoJD Jones. But with his
team in serious trouble, Warner
was sensational. He took full
charge of the offense and con-
trolled the tempo of the game.
Time and again, Warner
penetrated the Simpson defense
and sneaked beautiful passes to
teammates for crucial buckets. His
12 assists in the second half alone,
plus the Pioneers’ stubborn
defense, determined rebounding,
and clutch offensive per-
formances, brought Grinnell back
to an eight-point lead and spelled
doom for the Redmen.

It was a proud and satisfying
victory [or Grinnell's basketr
ballers. If the Pioneers can cons
tinue to perform with poise and
control, going to the hoop and
finding the open man on offense,
employing a stingy man-turman
defense. and positioning for the big
rebounds, they are capable of
playing with every team on their
schedule,

Grinnell journeys to the land of

Grapplers warm up
for season opener

By Robert Meyer

Grinnell wrestling, which last
year compiled its best record since
the championship exploits of the
testes squad, presently lacks a
sufficient turnnuL.,

Coach Stephan Moss, Parks and
Recreation Director for the city of
Grinnell and one time captain of
the U, of Iowa wrestling team,looks
positively toward the team’s future
despite his limited turnout.

Moss evaluates the team as a
group with “a lot of willingness to
learn." Moss, a great believer in
the philosophy of “offensive
wrestling," is presently teaching
the Grinnell grapplers how to
initiate the fighting action in their
matches.

Moss admits that the team is
“presently low in numbers , , but
what we have is good in quality,”
Such good quality includes to
captain Gordy Stacey (184) and
Rick Lee 1158), both of whom

qualified for the national tour-
nament last year.

Other grapplers include Marquis
Lyles (113), Mark Sokkappa (126),
Ed Hassey {167), Frank Corrigan
(150), Larry Cohen i177), Mark
Frankle (190), Jon Chnstianson
(177) and Paul Carter (hvt.).

Second term will add gridders

. Tom Hawbaker (150-158), Charlie

Gregg (142) and Jon Wilson (142).
Other people beginning second
semester are Jule Miller (167) and
co-captain David Greenwald tuli-
125). Who is now studying in
Grinnell's London program.

With only two meets scheduled
before vacation.Dec 3 and Dec. 7,
Moss isn't greatly worried about
his lack of personnel during these
final weeks of the first semester.
Instead, many people on the
wrestling team place most of their
concerns upon the team's busy
schedule during second semester.
