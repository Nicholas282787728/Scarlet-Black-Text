Little House

the old home to a guest house. Alter plan-
ning and redecoration, the house became
Griuneil House in March of 1961. Grinnell
House is now managed as a guest center
and private club by the hostess, Mrs. Je-
well R. Hawk (wife of the late Rupert Hawk
who was college Treasurertor many years).
She is assisted by two housekeepers, Mrs.
Gladys- Pagel (fulltime) and Mrs, Marilyn
Dixon (part-time), whose assorted duties
include cleaning, receiving guests during the
day, and overseeing receptions, Two
students live in the house and have full
responsibility from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 am.
and on weekends, tor making reservations,
admitting guests, and accepting payments,
The students, who are Evelyn Bateson and
David Crow this year, are paid by the
college and are tree in their off hours.
Although Grinnell House was essentially
iurnished when it was built, many pieces
have been added, most or them gitts oi es-
tates, The Rosenthal estate gave several
heautliul midrltlth century French articles,
including the two Wide chairs in the recepa
tiOI‘i room, a brocaded Sula, and the grand
piano. Mrs John S. Nollen donated a Com-
plete set of colonial bedroom iurniture used
during the Noiiens’ residence. The grandfatv
her clock in the reception room was de-
dicdted by the class (ll 1905 and later res
dedicated and moved to Grinneil House.
Special original pieces include a bronze
bust of Lincoln, the gift mirror in the trout
hall, and a mahongany game table with
elaborate Wood insets located on the third
iloor, The satinwoori commode in the res
caption room is an original, as is the Sher-
aton soia with mahogany lraine. other vale
uable furnishings, too numerous to list, fill
the house with a quiet charm appreciated
by many overnight guests. Also on display
are a number at original works of art from
the Grinneli College art collection,

throughout the year.
