There may be a time bomb in your dresser drawerian
environmental time bomb, that isiwhich may have been
openly and legally purchased at the bookstore or McNally’s.
You may be using one every day to apply shaving cream,
combat smells, or to kill a bug.

Aerosol sprays, those heretofore innocuous-looking
convenience items have recently come under fire as
’dangerous to the earth's upper atmosphere. Although
scientists and environmentalists had compiled much
damning evidence by January, 1974, it is only recently that
the issue has come under public scrutiny.

For those unfamiliar with the facts, the active aerosol
propellants iﬂuorocarbonsi have been found by many
scientists, most notably University of California professor F.
Sherwood Rowland and Dr. Mario J. Molina, to precipitate a
breakdown of the earth's protective ozone layer in the upper
stratosphere. Although the calculations involved are
questioned by some, it appears that the ozone breakdown
precipitated by ﬂuorocarbons is six times as efficient as the
depletion caused by SST nitrogen-oxide emissions.

A breakdown of the ozone layer, especially such a rapid
and thorough one as predicted by Rowland and Molina,
would eliminate the earth’s only protection from solar
radiation. The consequences that for the first thirty years
would be increased susceptibility to skin cancer, and possible
genetic mutations in plants. After 2050 A.D., 30 to 50 per
cent of the earth’s ozone layer would be depleted, causing
genetic breakdowns which would affect the entire food chain,
bring about great biological damage, and perhaps start a
shift of the stratospheric temperatures which would result in
a change of the world's weather patterns These predictions,
which were reported in the New Yorker (April 7, 1975) are
modest compared to those found in the New Times; some
scientists feel that ﬂuorocarbon-induced ozone erosion will
destroy all earthly life,

Recently, Congress studied some proposed bills which
would ban the production and sale of all aerosols which use
ﬂuorocarbon propellants. The legislation never made it out of
committee, due to some heavy lobbying on the part of the
DuPont corporation ilargest producer of ﬂuorocarbon gas)
and the legislators’ discomfort with wiping out an industry
in a period of recession.

Congress has decided that it is safe to balance off the
priorities of economy and environment while waiting for
“proof.” Now two new, spineless bills have been introduced,
both requiring proven studies prior to any banning—all this
in view of the fact that the Rowland-Molina findings were
based on the supposition that all ﬂuorocarbon production
would he stopped as of January, 1974. Every day that goes
by only'intensifies the destruction which may come.

The U.S. government is giving one capitalistic concern
more consideration than the world populace. It sounds
absolutely grisly, and it is.

As a college student in the middle of Iowa, there are
several things one can do to avert the situation. First, do not
buy any product which uses ﬂuorocarbon propellants (not all
do) until they are proven safe. Second, let merchants know
that you would appreciate it if they would not sell these
aerosols, or at least if they would provide non-aerosol
alternatives. Third, write your congress-member in support
of a bill which would ban ﬂuorocarbon propellants un-
conditionally, until they are proven safe.

As sales go down, aerosol makers will give in; a survey of
products shows a recent increaseeof non-aerosol hair sprays,
deodorants, etc. Maybe if the aerosol problem is conquered
we can go on to find an alternative to the other major source
of the world’s ﬂuorocarbon production—refrigeration and
air»conditioining units.

Lo’resi Stones early Stones ~

liy John Buckwaiter

The key to the Rolling Stones’
decade~long success has been their
ability to change with the times.
While a satanic, sexual image has
steadily been embraced by the
group, their music and appearance
is constantly being modernized
Hence, the most recent issue oi
Stones music is aptly entitled
Metamorphosis.

Metamorphosis, released on the
eve of the Stones' recent Y75 tour of
the States, is an attempt by London
Records to cash in on the Stones'
steady popularity, This label put
out the group's music from 1963
until i971; in 1971 the Stones began
their own label.

Although Metamorphosis con
tains dated songs, it is not a “best
of" album. Most oi the tunes have
not been previously released,
However, the songs are not war-

Bleed vein. The iirst song, “I Don’t
Know Why" was released as a
single and went nowhere, simply
because it is a great song Once its
simple, smooth melody becomes
ingrained in one’s memory it will
never be forgotten. Other songs
which stand out as exceptionallv<
good are “Family," which
reminiscent of “No Expectation

on the Beggar's Banquet album,
and “I’m Going Down," which
could easily have come iromg.
Sticky Fingers.

Metamorphosis is an unpolishe‘
album, which makes the music
seem to be more informal and
down-to-earth. People besides the
Stones play—Jimmy Page, John

material will probably tind
