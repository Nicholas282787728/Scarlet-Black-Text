ERA or SCARCITY—T ~

Looking at a program
for the future

For econ proi Robert
Voertman, the future holds
energy selfrsufficiellcy ior
Grinnell.

He feels that within the
next on years, through
heating and electrical co-
generation and sup-
plemental solar power,
Grinnell College may have
licked the energy crunch,

FOR TIIE- MOMENT
though, Voertman stresses
conservation and awareness
“We must raise the com-
munity consciousness and
pay very serious attention to
our energy habits," he
stresses,

Only after the community
develops better encrgy~use
habits can a meaningiul
assessment of Grinnell's
iuture energy needs be
made, He points out that in
the past, Grinnell's amount
of waste has been much
more excessive than it will
be after the benefits of
conservation methods are
measured,

LOWERING
temperatures, installing
better Windows, and the
increased amount of in-
sulation in the‘dorms Should
lower the college’s energy
use.

By raising student and
iaculty awarenessiso that

WATER

 

lights are Shut off when
leaving moms, windows are
left closed when the heat is
on, etcithe amount of
energy used should be furr
ther decreased.

AFTER THESE conserva-
tion measures, Voertman
feels. Grinnell Will be in a
much better position to
decide on the types oi energy
sources needed for the
future.

He suspects that solar
energy will play a part in the
iuture, and suggests
that the college seriously
explore the details oi in
stalling solar ‘panels to
several campus buildings.

HERRICK CHAPEL, he
feels, may be perfect tor a
solar system. which could
handle about 70 percent oi
the building's heating needs.

The south wall of the PEC
would also be a feasible
location for solar collectors,
Although it is not at the
proper angle for getting the
optimum collection of direct
rays, Vocrtman points out
that during the winter the
collector would also'pick up
rays reﬂected oii the snow,

ANOTHER POTENTIAL
solar building would he the
Fine Arts Center—vbul only
after the pine trees that
grace the southern exposure

 

But solar energy by itseli
cannot solve Grinnell's
energy problems. For this
goal, Voertman proposes co
generation.

A COVGENERATION
system would create both
campus electricity and
steam to supplement the
solar heatingiusing only
one primary energy source,
The cogeneration system
would create high-pressure
Steam to spin the electricity
making turbines. This steam
would come out as low-
pressure steamiexactly
what we now use to heat
campus buildings.

Voertman estimates that
the system would produce
enough electricity that the
college could sell surplus
amounts to Iowa Southern
Utilities.

HE ADMITS THAT there
are problems with his plan~
such as Grinnell’s rather
new and costly heating plant
that could become obsolete
because of the change—but
feels the college must begin
exploring alternatives. At
the moment though. he Sees
his plan as a very logical and
attractive choice

For Voertman, conserr
vation ls Ihe first and most
important thing to be done.
And he was saying that long
before it was chic

Long-term affects

Crunch to cause change

When the iull impact of the energy
shortage hits, drastic changes will occur in
all phases oi American liie. Sociology
professor Ilse Leitinger Is one person at
Grinnell who's concerned about what the
iuture holds ior society.

Leitlnger feels there is an “immense
urgency to create a campus-wide unr
deistanding oi the extent oi the energy
problem.” To this end, she has decided
that she will incorporate an energy
component into at least one of her courses
each year.

SHE FORESEES major changes that
will face society in the years ahead—but
she holds an optimistic view ot those
changes.

As a result oi higher heating iuel prices,
there will be cooler houses. This, she feels,
will possibly result in better health. The
gas shortage will result in more walkingA
which Leitinger feels will also add to more
healthful Americans.

RELATED TO THIS will be a “curtailr
ment of choices." Soon, one will have to
take distances into account when buying a
home. A house in the far suburbs for a
downtown business executive may no
longer be as attractive as it was when gas
was 39 cents a gallon.

Leitinger feels this change can be
turned to the good. “We may have to iall
back more on to our own resources—
intellectural, cultural, etc," she says,
“but imagine the possibilities: wouldn't it
be marvelous if there was no TV.”

INDEE. HER OVERALL tone about
the impen ing cultural changes is ope
timistic. “If we come up to the challenge,
things can be fine.”

Another change she forecasts is one in
dietary habits. But these changes too can
be for the better. “There vxill be a
change from high energy intensive food to
more low energy intensive ioodeless
meat intake," she says.

AND CLOTHING styles, too, will be
touched by the energy shortage, “People
won‘t be wearing see-through blouses in
the winter," she said.

She feels the crisis may turn out to be a
“blessing in disguise," though admits that
that could be “wishful dunking,”

SHE SAYS THAT the American people
have a good deal of ingenuityibut that
recently that ingenuity has not been put to
the best use, ”If the American people will
stop being spoiled brats and apply that
ingenuity. then we will be-able to handle
the problem.” she emphasizes.

Politics of energy iocuse
on large scale

Beiore we can solve the energy problem, science will have to come
to grips with the technological aspects oi alternative energy sources.
But at the moment, the political aspects of the energy situation also

have to be dealt With.

The Grinnell po isci department oiieis two energy-related courses:
Politics oi Land and Sea Resources, taught by Wayne Moyer. and
Politics ol Energy in the United States, taught hy Sandy Danforth

DANFORTH SAYS SIIF finds most of the enerZV emphasis at

are removed, he says.

Grinnell has finally found its place in the
sun. The first solar home in the community
will open its doors next weekend, May 12 and
13 from 1:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m ,to an interested
public..The house, located at 15th Street and
$pencer Street, is being built by the Grinnell
Federal Savings and Loan Association to

distribute energy from the sun. “We looked at
heat pumps and evaluated literature on
commercially-made solar collectors,”
recalled one student. “I was surprised to see
all the companies into solariwe waded
through material from dozens of manufac-
turers." '

mented on the selection of a house plan.
“Immediately after school started in the fall,
we (Eisenman, Murray, and chemistry
professor Luther Erickson) decided to go
ahead with a prefabricated house design.
The objective was to make the home as
standard as possible to illustrate to the

Several students and faculty of the college
have participated in the project at the in-
vitation of Al Eisenman, president of Grinnell
Federal and a trustee oi the college, Last
spring, a group pt 14 students and tour iaculty
members studied how the sun's energy could
be used for home heating. “The first thing we
realized is that no solar heating scheme will
work if the house is poorly insulated,"
commented one project member. “The most

structure of the home itself to collect and
store energy. The additional cost of such
design features can often be justified, since
they can also serve an aesthetic or practical
function. Student designs included such
passive features as greenhouses, which
collect large amounts of light energy during
the day and can be closed off from the house
at night, and massive brick walls, which store
heat in the day and release it to warm the
house at night.

UNFORTUNATELY, MANY of theseideas , ,

average homeowner the practicality of solar
heating."

Time and budget constraints w e also
cited in the decision. Design mod‘ cations
that could be made to the pre-fab house plan
were limited, but there was ﬂexibility in
window and room placement. Such
alterations were made to allow most of the
south-facing wall of the house to carry solar
collectols. , »

ONE BRIGHT, SUNNY day last week,
members of the study group and others
visited the solar house. The large array of
collectors was silently doing its thing as we
- went inside. Sure enough, we could feel the

warmth of heat radiating from the solar
, ductwork. Murray explained, “The sunlight
‘ passes through the glass plate of the collector

where the energy is trapped and heats the air.

The air is circulated into a large storage bin

which holds the heat for use at night or on

«cloudy days.“ ,

' While a conventional furnace and water
heater are still needed for extended cloudy
periods (yes, even in Crime“), Murray
estimates that 64) percent of the total heating
requirement will be supplied by the solar
system. Students are planning to check such
assumptions in the next year by using a
microcomputer to monitor temperatures
throughout the home. -

So are you in the market tor a solar home?
The solar heating system alone will cost you
312.000, which Murray estimates will pay for
itselt in 15-20 years, depending on the rate oi
conventional fuel Cost hikes, When con-
struction is completed this summer, the house
will be rented during the next year while
monitoring work is done. Then the house will

which has a rather science
centered curriculum. But sh
points out that it is important to 59
energy as a political problem,

She says that in 1973, President
Richard Nixon and other govern
mental officials tried to ”create .
crisis situation and thus galvan
the nation to make the essentla
energy decisions."

Carter. she feels, has tried to d-
the same thing. Both men
however. have failed to convin
most of the nation that the situatio ,
is really critical, .

THE GOVERNMENT ha
been rather ineffective in deali
with the so far “undramatic fac *
of the shortage." Danforth feel
the policy toward oil is “weak,'
though the policy in regard t.
natural gas is somewhat better,

Part of me difficulty in deal‘ _
with the problem is oil and natura
gas interest groups. Nonetheless
she is “convinced that the count
is committed to search for an-
develop new energy alternatives
And they will be found," \

DANFDRTH DOES NOT fee
that the somewhat halfrasse
governmental policy towar.
cnergy will be harmful in the lo
run. “The current policy i-
inadequate in moving us abead,’
she concedes, but adds, “I don'
think they're (the government
moving at a pace they feel is un
safe.”

She feels the government shoul-
put more money into exploration 0
alternative energy sources, bu
real' es that this create
poli cal problems. The ad
ministration. she says, tends to b.
committed to large scale energ
projects.

“FROM A political point o-
view ” she says, “this is a Wis

there's no call for major change

But from the point of view 0
