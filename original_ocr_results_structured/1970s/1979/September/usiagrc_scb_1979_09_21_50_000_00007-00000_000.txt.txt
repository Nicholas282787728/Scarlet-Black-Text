gas. Noting that we need to “get off
our knees to the OPEC cartel" she
said we must encourage greatci DlOr
duction by deregulating, and also said
that We need an 80 percent excess pros
fits tax that takes increased pl'oduc»
tion into account (unlike the Cartcr
plan)

She doesn't believe that we can icly
on conservation, and, at the same
time, sees no alternative to using
nuclear power. As someone with ex
perience as a federal regulator, she
said she believes that if the necessary
steps are taken, we can insure that the
Three Mile island fiasco will not hap~
pen again.

At the South Lounge gather mg, the
question was raised about how her
husband intends to curb inflation Ms.
Dole replied that efforts would be
centered around a combination of a
tight money policy aild using ins
novative ideas to encourage greater
productivity and competition in the
market place.

Another important step would be to
cut the federal budget. She said her
husband favors a constitutional cone
mention to place a mandatory limit on
federal spending. She also talked
about tax indexing, which is a plan to
prevent people from moving into
higher tax brackets when they receive
cost oi living pay increases.

She said that today, people pay
more in increased taxes than they
receive in pay raises She cited this as
one oi the waysin which Dole works
for measures that help the average
person.

A member of the audience objected
to the claim that Dole represents
the interests of workers. He said he
remembers a sneering comment about
George Meany (chairman to the AFL-
CIO) Dole made during a debate with
Walter Mondale in 1976. He said that
his father belongs to an AFLVCIO af -
filiated union and is currently on
strike, and that he didn't like Dole's
antiunion sentiments displayed in that
debate, Ms. Dole's only response was
to say that a comment about a ilnion
leader does not make Dole anti-union.
She indicated that Meany is perhaps
too powerful and doesn’t necessarily
represent the working man and
woman.

On issues relating to ioreigii policy,
Dole‘s campaign literature says he is
a proponent of “peace through
strength." and that he opposed
ratification of the Panama Canal
Treaties. Ms. Dole said her husband
has much experience in the Senate in
dealing with foreign policy ucstions
He participated in the Wol'l Food
Conference in Rome, and has an ac-
tive interest in Food for Peace and
human rights concerns. whilc hc is
very informed in the area of foreign
policy, she noted that he is also smart
enough to surround himself with the
best advisers.

Dole does not favor recognizing the

lPLO) until they recognize me
sccurity ol the state of Israel.

0n the draft, her husband said that he
is against registration or a drait at ,
this time. On the issue of including
women in the draft, should there be
one, she was not sure of her husband's
slnnd. She did say that his support tor
the ERA would be consistent with
drafting ivoniengbecause equal rights
nicnn equal responsibilities.

Iowa is crucial to Dole and the other
Republican presidential hopefuls
because of its early caucuses in
January, 1380, the first in the nation.
The Dole campaign strategy is to
sh v strongly in the first eight
primaries and caucuses.

While her husband is busy doing
Senate-related business, Ms, Dole is
campaigning full time, spending much
ol her time in lowa. She says she en~
jo ' campaigning, even though her
schedule sounds grueling. Being an ac-
complished woman, with long ex-
pt‘i'ielice in the federal government,

she was most articulate when talking
about the issues in which she has had
a special interest.

Ms. Dole likes to stress that there is
a strong humanitarian element in her
husband’s career.

Certainly her own interests fall
along that line. As an FTC commis- _
sinner for five years . she worked to
eliminate what she calls unfair
methods of Competition that hurt con-
sumers. She has a special interest in
defending the consumer interests of
the elderly on fixed incomes. She
noted that as good as free enterprise
is, it is not perfect, and anti-trust
measures have to be vigorously ens
forced.

As staff assiswnt to the assistant
secretary of Health, Education and
Welfare, she specialized in the educa-
tional problems of the handicapped.
She also has been involved in the area
of the education of the deaf. In 1974,
Time Magazine named her (then
Elizabeth Hanford) to a list of
America‘s 200 “Faces for the Future."

Professor Dick Steele will be leading
‘a computer workshop. T esday, Sept,
25, and the following Tu sday, Oct. 2.
The two-part workshop, entitled “Text
Processing," is designed for Students,
faculty, and staff who would like to
use Grinnell’s computer system to
print written material to their
specifications, .

With the use of a computer terminal
and the Diablo printer, a person can
here his or her term paper, exam, or
other writing, printed with exact right

and lcl’t margins,
it is also possible to instruct the

computer to print tables and graphs.
The hiiisiied product may be printed
on bond typing paper with a carbon
ribbon. if desired, alld resembles a
prolcssioiial printing job.

An advantage oi utilizing the come
puter Is that all editing can be done
heiorc the manuscript is printed.
Words. phrases, or whole paragraphs
can be inserted or deleted from the
coiiiputei lnemol y, and then the
manuscript is ready for printing.

Heie S how it works: a student, for
Instance is writing a term paper,
After writing a rough draft, he in-
sli-ucts the computer on the format of
the paper and error correction. He
then begins his typing at a Cathode
Ray Tube (CRT) unit, which displays
his writing on a ’l‘Vrlike screen. Cnre
i'cctlng a typographical error on a
computer terminal can be more com-
plicated than using white-out on a
typewriter, but once the correcting

pi ucess UCCOmeS routine, corrections
can be made quickly, Footnotes and
other irregular spacing require special
instructions for the computer.

Once the rough drait has been
typed, the student prints it on one oi
the printer verminals, takes his com-
puter draft home to prnofread, andr
makes corrections. ‘

it he had typed his rough draft ona
regular typewriter, he would be forced
to retype the entire manuscript to in-
sert his corrections. Using the editing
system, he can instruct the computer
to make the corrections within his ﬁle
without typing everything a second,
third, or fourth time.

The edited manuscript is printed
again. Provided that the user’s in-
structions are correct, the margins.
page numbers, footnotes, and .
paragraphs will be automatically ad-
justed after the writer’s insertion or
deletion of material.

Steele became familiar with the text
processing method while working on a
book-this summer. He describes the '
computer as a “very fast secretary”
and recommends text processing to
anyone with lengthy writing to do. No
computing experience is required to
attend the two workshops

To sign up for the workshops, talk to
the Computer Services secretary, ex-
tension 410.

“Text Processing" is the first in a
series planned by the Grinnell College
Computer Service. Other short pro
grams will be offered throughout the
year if there appears to be enough in-
terest.
