Ceramics: objects by hand

by Kate Shakeshott

Craft pottery, the creation of clay
objects by hand, occupies a peculiar
position in the realm of the arts. It is
an ancient medium which has always
united beauty with utility, or as an
thropologists call them, expressive
with instrumental qualities.

Since the advent of industrial mass-
production oi cheap standardized
ceramic ware, handmade pots have
lost part of their utilitarian status, and
been subsumed under the purely ex-
pressive category of art, Yet pottery
is denied the esteem accorded, say,
painting, precisely because of its
usefulness.

Unique beauty in a functional object
enriches daily life; the human conner
tion in a pot, made by hands to be use
ed by hands, is of Value to the maker
and to the user. This is not to say that
the interest and value of craft pottery
lie exclusively in its daily use. -

Farewell, My Integrity

“Why this is hell, nor am I out of
it." Indeed. Realizing that Marlowe
died in l953, he heaved a grateful sigh
oi relief. Grimly clutching the office
bottle in one hairy paw, he stared
bleakly across the tiny oitice at the
back of the glass door. “HTOV St
XIWTUV," it read, but the HTOVior
vorn, read properly from the out-
sideiwould soon be coming off the
door.

His partner, Miles Voth, was on ice
down at the morgue, stampeded to
death by a regiment of ltalian
iishwives down at the public market,

Pondering the cost of a new glass
plate and wishing his ﬁrst name was
Butch or Stan—anything a bit more
rugged than Cecil—he splashed iour
lingers of bourbon into his cottee mug
and let it trickle down his paw. The
door buzzer sounded. “Come!" he
bellowed, and a redhead walked in.

There a ' ' ‘edhelltls and there are
redheads. J l‘crr‘ is the short confident
redhead whr has take“ night classes
in everything trom dieseirepair to
scuba diving, and wants to be your
friend.

There is the tall, redhead with a pro
minent gait who never says a word.
usually because she has a mouth like
a industrial trash masher.

There is the sparkling coquettish
redhead who slinks up to you at a bar,
lets you buy her a lew drinks, excuses
herself to go powder somethlng, and
then disappears, along with your
wallet.

September M, l 979

I urge you to spend a few minutes
and take a look at the current exhibit
in the Negative Space Gallery. You’ll
see some interesting pieces made by
Ms Zirkle's advanced ceramics class
last spring.

Take a long careful look at Mark
Kreider's ”modified vase” and! think
you'll agree with me about the added
value oi such a pot over run-of—the-
mill manuiactured “modified vases"
we all see and use every day.

Even such a mundane thing as a
bowl can be a pleasure to look at, as
Brian Jones’ and Sheldon Tapley’s
pieces illustrate And there’s a flower
pot (or “planter," as we artists like
to say) like no other flower pot you’ve
ever seen.

ldon’t promise immediate
enlightenment, but a thoughtful gaze
at this exhibit might just open your
eyes a bit to one oi the things that
is missing in our culture.

 

The untitled sculpture
seen on central campus
near the Science Building
was designed by Professor
Glen Zirkle. Commissions
ed by former President
Glenn Leggett, the
sculpture was completed
in 1975‘

It is constructed of Cor-
Ten steel, which is selfv
oxiding.

it you haven't taken a
good look at it, stop and
view the sculpture from
various angles.

And iinally, there is the cool, down
torearth redhead, who puts on no
pretentious, and doesn’t have to.
because she’s smarter than anyone in
the room, including you.

But this was none of those women,
and carefully he surveyed her with the
trained eye of the professional W
detective.

Blue eyes, smallish nose, high
cheekbones, no jewelry, dark blue
suit, pale blue scarf with edelweiss
pattern, sensible flat-heeled buckle
shoesihlue, and cracked fingernail
polish on the third finger of her left
hand. The young lady was also

possessed of a smile, restrained at the ‘

moment, but which he suspected
would be devastating at full force, and
a iigure to make a bishop kick a hole
through a priest, He waved casually at
the client’s chair opposite his desk.
“What can I do for you. Mis .7”

‘Ah fer Chrissakes, Cecil. are you
too stewed to recognize yer own God-
damn secretary‘!” she rasped. It was
her, all right, to the human ear as en-
ticing as the third witch in
“Macbeth.” in disposition as endear-
ing as a road worker‘s shorts.

“Christ on a Stick," he thought to
himself, “I’ve’got to maintain con-
trol!“ Desperately clutching the bottle
in his clammy hands, he darted his
gaze wildly about the room, on, he
knew they were out there, hunkered
down under the filling cabinet and
crouching in the closet, barely permit-

ting themselves to breathe, and every
one of the stinking bastards just
waiting for him to make a wrong
move, one little mistake, so they could
gun him down in a withering storm or
automatic weapons fire.

Fighting to overcome me wave of
paranoia that his position so often
thrust upon him, he raced hs thoughts
back over the events of the last iew
days, events which culminated in the
arrival of his partner, or what was lelt
of him, at the otiice door, packed in a
pickled herring jar.

Poor Miles, savagely clubbed down
in his prime with a frozen 25 pound
Coho solmon. Well, they weren’t going
to get him that way; Mrs. Vutwix
hadn‘t raised an idiot.

Surrepticiously scratching his ass,
he forced himself to concentrate on a
plan of action. Moments later, his
train of thought was derailed in a bar-
rage ot shattered glass. A note wrap-
ped around a brick sailed through the
office window, caromed off his Skull,
and lodged in the wall of his 20 gallon
aquarium, startling both eels and term
minating the life of his favorite
bottomrsucking catfish. He paused to
to wonder how the brick got up the 24
stories to his office, and then removed
the note for examination.

Meanwhile, the authors, having lost
control of the narrative line, took a
week off. (Next: The shooting time

starts.)
