Awareness is the key BMW
' Error in caption seen as harmful

You can do something about energy.

The most important thing is to be aware of the problems.
Once you are aware, you see that actions can be taken very .
easily.

STUDENTS CAN TAKE the initiative right now by
turning off the lights and turning down the heat. And they
would do well to revive the 1960’s motto of “Take a shower
with a friend," and then follow that advice'

Also, students can heed the example of cities where water
is a precious commodity. In the “small is beautiful” land of
California, the mottos have been “Waste Not,” and ”If it's
yellow let it mellow . . .”

THESE SLOGANS MAY seem insipid, but PR is no
doubt in order to help educate everyone that the era of
scarcity is upon us.

Inra recent Wall Street Journal article, Middlebury College
is cited as an exemplary institution for its attempts to
confront the increasing costs of energy. The article identifies
problems which are the same as those now facing Grinnell.

MIDDLEBURY HAS implemented a successful con-
sciousness»raising campaign using its media facilities,
especially the college radio station, and has sought ways to
develop alternative energy sources. (An application for a
grant to build a solar collector on campus was turned down
because the school's New England clime does not meet the
requirements for enough sunny days).

Grinnell should follow Middlebury's lead lKDIC and Jack
Robertson please take note of the above examples), The
college has already had some success in the quick fix area,
but as the saying goes: “There’s so much more to do.” And a
sophicated institution like Grinnell has enormous potential
for generating creative ideas about how to deal with the era
of scarcity.

IRONICALLY, THE NEW era is coming in on the heels
decade of apathy. Our generation has been paradoxically
cast as being both materialistic and ambitious, yet dope 'n
disco mellowed at the same time. .

The era of scarcity calls for attention, action. and personal
,energy which one may. be hard put to find these days.
Hopefully, the efforts of the Energy Advisory Committee,
the Physical Plant, the academic departments, projects like
the solar house, and even this issue of the 5&1? will help
arouse the interest and concern that is needed.

Or, we can ignore the problems and party on, continuing

wasteful and inefficient ways. But they say there's an ice age
coming.

To the editors: “Prices are higher
than McNally’s, but many feel the
atmosphere is worth it. If you’ve

,got the time. stop in Edwards’

Grocery and get a blast from the
past," this caption appeared uns
derneath Karl Dukstein’s
photograph in the Aprils edition of
the 5&6. The photograph and the
caption accompany an article
which accurately describes the
history of the family owned store
and the way“a store like Edwards’
survives in the head-to-head
competition with the likes of Hy-
Vee and KwiksShop.”

The caption is unjust and does
not describe the action in the
photograph. Edwards' stocks a
substantial amount of goods which
are priced lower than McNally's
and vice versa; thus, it is grossly
unfair to make a slanted
generalization on the price dii-
ference between the two
businesses. A controversial point
such as price difference should be
dealt with in the body of the news
story raiher than in a caption. On
reading Jonathan Elbaum's acs
count of Edwards', “Who's Min-
ding the Store?," one discovers
that he fairly defines the nature of
the price difference, Elbaum
explains Ihat “. . most of their
iEdwardS'i prices are comparable
to those in bigger stores." The
distinction between “comr
parable," in the article, and
“higher,” in the caption, is in-
consisent at best. aside from

being shoddy journalism.

I first became aware of the out-
of-place caption when I paid one of
my regular visits to Edwards’
Grocery last week. My intent was
to take some photographsrof the
pmprieiors, Hazel, Howard, and
Marie Edwards, while they cons
ducted business. Naturally I asked
them ii they had objections. All
three shied at the prospect oi being
recorded on film—a reaction which
was alien to this photographer,
expecially in Grinnell. Inquiring
about their inhi on, I was
presented. by Marie, with an April
6 edition of the Sim.

Marie said they all bitterly cl}
jected to the caption and added~
that some of their clients had
commented about the offensive
legend! 1 was even more startled
when Marie told me that one of the
owners of Hansen’s Danish Maid
Bakery, Susi Hansen. had
protested the inappropriate cap-
(ion!

The feature Story on Edwards' is
an annual story which has ap
peared in the paper over the past
few years. The Edwards’said they
would decline any iuiure 8&8
interviews. They collectively
decided that no letter to the editor
or formal complaint wuuld be
submitted to the college or the 5&3
protesting the caption.

In View of the circumstances, I
volunteered to write a letter on
their behalf. If I had not been
trying to photograph Hazel,

Well -established business have

The caption is viewed by 5&8
editors Bob Mitchell and Dan
Flynn as relatively unimportant in
comparison to the article or the
picture. The editors explained that
formulation of captions is one of
the last steps in the production
process of the mbloid, i.e. captions
are created either late Wednesday
night or early Thursday morning.
Unfortunately, I could not locate
the composer of the caption, so one
assumes that the editors are
directly responsible for the im-
plications oi the caption.

I hope the editors include a
correction or clarification of the
tactless and outsof-context caption
in this issue I'm sure the author of
the caption did not williully offend
a local business, but it is Vital for
the son editors to recognize an
unintentional error which caused a
