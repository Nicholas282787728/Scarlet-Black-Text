Soft porn flashed for Gang Bang weekend

Flesh Gordon, a dirty takeoff on
comic book characters, and Anna
Christie (1930), a soap-opera starring
Greta Garbo, make up the film fare
for this weekend.

Flesh Gordon begins by explaining
what it’s trying to do. Any movie
which needs an explanation either
shouldn’t have been made at all or
didn’t accomplish what it set out to do.
This film falls into the last category.

The plot is very simple. Earth is be
ing bombarded by a sex-ray which
gives people “sex madness” and
therefore starts many orgies. Pro-
fessor Gordon’s son, Flesh, 3 female
friend of his, and a scientist all go to
Porno, the planet from which the ray
is coming. After many problems. lots
of nudity, several dirty jokes, a few
more orgies, and phallic symbols
everywhere Flesh and company
defeat the evil Wang (who had taken
over the planet) and make the
universe safe once again for all decent
people.

The story line, the characters, and
the setting are all perfect for the kind
of sex farce this movie is trying to

filth/tom spackman and wilbur glassman

portray. Unfortunately, much of the
time everybody simply tries too hard,
which makes everything collapse. The
humor is so forced at times that it
undermines the subtle parody evident
in the development of the characters
and the plot. The scenes which do
work are hilarious, but they tend to
make the rest of the film disappoin»
ting by comparison.

I walked into Anna Christie thinking
it was a Leo Tolstoy epic. When I
walked out, I knew it wasn't an epic, it
hadn’t been written by Tolstoy, and it
was probably written by someone who
did not even have command of the
English language. Every one of the
major characters has an accent: one
Swedish, one Irish, one Garbo. The on
1y saving grace is the accents make it
impossible to understand much of the
dialogue. Let’s lace it, some movies
just don‘t stand the test of time. I
don't know how this movie was receiv-
ed 50 years ago when it was made, but
it it hasn’t lost something the pros
ducer of The Big Bus had an uncle in
show business.

Anna Christie is not a comedy, so '
don’t get me wrong. It’s serious, very
serious, very, very serious; so serious,
in fact, it borders on the ridiculous.
Slow moving, and containing a lot of
talking, it reminds you of a typical
Grinnell party.

Garbo has the titular role' In this
film, as an ex prostitute who comes to
visit the father who abandoned her‘ 15
years ago The father 15 the captain of
a coal barge and a drunkard. -
There s a fateful reunion scene which
occurs fairly early in the movie. Dad
meets daughter and it goes from
there, They have their ups and dovirns,
and battle with the demon sea. (I ‘ '
guess there was some allegory in' '
there, but I can't figure it out.)

If you’re tired and need some sleep,
or if you ve always wanted to see‘Gar- ’
[)0 without a bra, then go see it. Other-
wise, do something a lot more in
teruting: drink a Pepsi ' '

Mozart, Basie in weekend concerts

by Mark Harris

The music department shows off its
organizations this weekend as the Jazz
Band and orchestra present concerts
in Roberts Theater and Herrick
Chapel respectively. Conductors John
Jensen and Terry King have been
preparing their groups since the
beginning of the semester and look
forward to rewarding, entertaining
results.

The Jazz Band, comprised of four
trumpets, four trombones, six sax,
piano, rhythm guitar, and bass, is
combining charts for the whole band
and those for smaller ensembles, six
in all, for their concert.

The tunes for the band en masse in-
clude Ja Da and A Nice Girl Like
You—both Count Basie numbers and
the latter a jazz'waltz featuring a
“mist. other charts planned are
Green Onion and One More Revival.
Two arrangements by Dave Kapp:
Paper Moon and Radiator State Park,
fill out the program

Smaller groups had yet to be set at

, press time, but Jensen seemed en.
thusiastic about the possibilities.
Keyboardsman‘Steve Kern was also
optomistic about the band, saying,
“We lack some of the individual talent
of last year’s band, but there are a lot
of freshman and new students who
have apparently come from good jazz
bands in high school. so it’s more of a
cohesive unit. ”

The orchestra’s selections include
Mozart’s sinionie in G K. 550 and

November 9, 1979

Beethoven’s exhilirating Symphony
No, is open. Director King commented
on the program: “Mozart and
Beethoven often wrote for chamber or-
chestras. They (the symphonies) work
for 30-40 people. I identify with them
musically and we can do them some
justice.”

Also included are three arias:
Charpentier’s Louise, and two from
Mozart's Magic Flute—Queen or the

Night and 0 zittre Nicht. All three
feature sparkling performances by ’
Leslie King. ""I‘he Mozart arias are
traditionally the two most difficult
arias to sing. They re always asked
for at auditions and Leslie Certainly
gives the best interpretation I ve ever
heard " said King.

The Jazz Band starts its set at 8; 00
tonight and the orchestra begins atthe‘
same time on Sukday
