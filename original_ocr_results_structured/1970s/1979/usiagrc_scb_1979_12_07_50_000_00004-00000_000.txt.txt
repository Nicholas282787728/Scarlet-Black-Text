/Larew attack Leach conservativism

by /t/Oll Mandel

Jim Larew, a former staff assistant
to Iowa Senator John Culver, is oppos-
ing incumbent Jim Leach tor the isi
District congressional seat This
district includes Grinnell.

Larew is turning against Leacli
because he teels the progressive
policies supported by the lst District
are not being advocated by Leach.

“Anything that touches on con-
troversy is avoided, Iowa is not get-
ting its views presented. Leach has a
moderate image but a conservative
voting record," Larew remarked.

He faulted Leach, whose “base is
conservative and represents large
business and the economic powers
that'control too much of the economy
already, This campaign will offer an
opportunity to discuss the important
issues.”

Larew spoke before an audience
composed nearly exclusively or
members of the Grinnell College
Democrats. His talk was informal and
gave a general introduction to his
political Views. Commented Larew,
“I'm optimistic, experienced in
organizing campaigns, and I have a
realistic sense of what needs to be
done."

He sees his candidacy, which will
not be oiiicially announced until
February, as a grass roots one. Larew
stated» he has little money and must
campaign on name recognition Addie
tionally, he feels he must create an
argument on the differences between
himself and Leach. The fundamental
task, he added, is to make the voters
believe there is a difference between

candidates

That task): a ditticult one, he said,
because the percentage ot Iowans who
believe it does not matter whom they
elect to ottice is increasing

Moreover, in the mo election,
Democratic turnout was low and in
mod the reelection bids ot several
Iowa politicians, Larew pointed out.
He views the upcoming 1930 election
as an important one and believes
Democrats will vote due to the concurs
rent presidential election and also
since many Iowans are determined to
keep John Culver in ofﬁce

Larew also cited the sting felt by
Dick Clark's upset as another reason
tor potential increased Democratic
turnout. He cautioned that if
Democratic turnout at the polls is poor

Inflation causes
40 percent aid boost

The financial aid budget will be up
ped 40 % next year according to Pro-
vost Waldo Walker Walker reported
an increase in financial aid funds of
$555,000 at Monday's faculty meeting.
The present budget is $1,350,000.

Walker said the increase has been
caused by inflation; parents are ex
pected to contribute $325 less on the
average for their Children’s education
next year. Thus, individual need will
be greater and the college’s various
aid programs will have to make up the
difference,

Walker told the faculty that the

liiiancial aid budget will comprise an
impressive portion oi the total college
budget next year. ”It‘ll be one-twelfth
of a $12,300.000 budget." he said.

The subject of declining enrollment
was brielly addressed at the meeting
Walker told the faculty that “we're
running even for next year ‘ The
Class of 1984 will have 340 students, he
said He also explained that the Col-
lege cannot have more than 1,220
students attending next year since the
renovations are moving into the larger
dormitories and the substitute housing
will be extremely tight

once again,’ Democrats will Suffer the
same fate as in 1978.

in response to a question, Larew
said he isiopposed to the reinstate-
ment of the draft because it “allows
us to make very unrealistic choices. It
allows the country to do things
militarily without the support of the
people

He thinks nuclear power is
uneconomical at the present time
without government supports. Larew
also cited examples oi waste disposal
problems as another iault presently
plaguing this power source. He con
cluded that “we should not build any
more (nuclear facilities) unless we
have incredibly close scrutiny by
those who don't have a vested ins
terest "

Larew criticized Leach for not delve
ing into an array ot major issues per
tiiient to Iowans. He mentioned the
family'farm, grain transportation, and
the loss of farmland and topsoil in
general as important subjects Leach
has not dealt with.

in terms of his challenge to Leach,
Larew views Grinnell College and
Poweshiek County as very important
areas They possess “a very latent
sense oi progressive tradition waiting
to be mobilized, A progressive voice
needs to be heard," he said.

Larew, 25, is an Iowa City native
and a 19 graduate of Harvard
University. His honors thesis in
history was written on the Iowa
Democratic party and will soon be
published by the state historical socies
ty under the title: “A Party Reborn:
The Democrats at town, 195071974,"

Larew worked for Culver's 1974
campaign and returned to work tor
Culver in Washington, D C in 1975 as
a member of his staff
