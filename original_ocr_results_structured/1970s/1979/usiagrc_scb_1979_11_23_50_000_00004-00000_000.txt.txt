Board Chairman Fritz Maytag said,
“There is no question that Joe Rosen-
lield's work on behalf of Grinnell Col-
lege has been decisive in assuring
long~range quality and stabilitquoe
has given unsparingiy or his support,
counsel. and guidance to assure the
college’s health and outstanding
reputation.”

Initial gifts and pledges for
establishment of the program came
from trustees, and these funds have
been supplemented by contributions
from other friends and colleagues of
Rosenlield.

Rosenfield, a 1925 Grinnell grad, has
been a member of the college's board
of trustees since 1941. He is the retired
president and board chairman of
Younkers department stores, and has
been a member of various civic and
business organizations.

Before Monday's faculty meeting at
which Drake announced the program,
rumors of Wall’s return were cir-
culating, and Drake’s confirmation
was greeted with applause

Wall had been a member of the cola
lege's faculty {or so years when he an
nounced in 1977 that he was resigning
to become chairman of the history
department at the State University of
New York at Albany. Wall graduated
from Grinnell in 1941 and received ad-
vanced degrees from Harvard and

Columbia.

At the time of his resignation, he
was both the college's Parker pro-
fessor ol history and the Strong
distinguished proicssor, Wall was
chairman of the faculty from 1966 to
1969 and dean of the college from 1969
to 1973, He had served as chairman of
the history department at various
times, and also, along with Professor
Charles Cleaver, founded the college’s
American Studies program,

Wall has published several books
and articles, including the bicenten-
nial history of lowa and the biography
of industrialist Andrew Carnegie, In
1971, he won the Bancroft prize for the
latter book,

At the time of his resignation, Wall

cited several reasons for leaving Grin~
nell. Probably the most prominent of
these was the reduced teaching load at
SUNY, which would give him more
time to devote to his latest work, a
study of Alfred du Pont, Wall said at
the time, “It was a hard deciSlon to
make. I did not make it lightly or easi-
ly,"

When asked recently about the du
Pont book, Wall said that it ”hadn’t
progressed as well as I expected,” but
added that he “hopes to have more
time to Work on it" under the new
teaching agreement with Grinnell.

He concludes: “I'm really excited
about returning to Grinnell and the
new program has great
possibilities...

$420 taken in Pub theft

by John Mandel

Thieves netted over $400 in cash and
checks during a Pub break-in early
last Saturday morning.

The robbers made their entrance by
breaking a pane of glass on one of the
outer doors on the lower level of Main
Hall. They then broke into one at the
closets in the corridor between these
doors and those leading into the Pub
by removing one of the double doors
from its hinges. Stolen was $350 in

Next Thursday's Scholars' Cnnvoca~
tion speaker Will once again be chosen
from the ranks of the faculty. Helena
Percas de Ponseti, Seth Richards Pro»
lessor of Modern Languages and
Spanish professor, will give a talk in
Herrick Chapel at 11:00 a m, entitled:
“Cervantes and Painting: ‘The
Painter and Writer are One and the
Same.’ ”

The address elaborates her ongoing
anlaysis of the literary techniques ill
Cervantes' Don Quijotc, first describ-
ed in her latest book: Cervantes y su
concepto dei arts (2 volumes, 1975).

“Cervantes," Ponseti explains,
“uses the techniques of the painter in
order to express his own views about
the issues he raises behind his sure
rogate authors. The views of the nar-
rator or of any of the characters, in»
cluding the protagonist, are not
necessarily Cervantes' views...[They]
may be accepted by the reader or re-
jected...”

Ponseti has been at Grinnell since
1948 She was named Outstanding
Educator of America in [EX/ll and has
published a number of articles on
women’s literature in South America
(1101' doctoral work) and, since 1968, on
Don Qiiijole and other works of Car
vantes.

In addition, she is an experienced

lecturer in the U.S., Europe, and Latin
America. This semester, Ponseti
teaches courses on Cervantes, the
Spanish Civil War and its aftermath.
as well as a Spanish writing class, the
Art or Language, and a Spanish cone
versation course. For those interested
in learning about some of the literary
techniques employed in Cervantes’
non oiiijotc irom a well-known
scholar in the field, Thursday's cone
vocation should be a good opportunity.

cash and $70 in checks, which con-
stltuted the evening’s receipts.

The night watchman found the
closet door off its hinges, but the
cashbox was left behind. A window
behind the pinball machine was also
broken, loading police to believe the
thieves may have also entered the
main Pub area. However, nothing was
missing or out of place, according to
Pub Manager Tom Kozal,

The night watchman discovered the
theft about 4 am. Saturday, during his
rounds. Kozal said he had left the
building at about 2 a m. after closing
up,

Grinnell police have no leads, but
theorize the pcrpetrators may have
been non-students, since a number [ll
other problems involving nonstiidents
occurred about the same time as the
Pub theft. They feel more than one in-
dividual was involved due to the [act
that the closet door was removed from
its hingcs while the padlock remained
attached,

During the summer, the Pub was
the scene oi" two other breakrms. On
one occasion, robbers took apprpx-
imately $150. Later in the summer,
nine cases of beer were stolen from
another Closet in the same corridor.
