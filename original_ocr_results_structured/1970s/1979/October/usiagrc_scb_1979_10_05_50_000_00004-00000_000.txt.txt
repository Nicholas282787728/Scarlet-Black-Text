Committee drags on
Mears, Goodnow decision

by Anne Rowland

As the semester passes, Mears Cot»
tage waits for a final decision on its
future.

A year ago, the Board of Trustees
voted to raze the structure, one of two
pre»1900 buildings remaining on cam-
pus Facing opposition and the
nomination of Mears to the National
Registry of Historic Places, the board
granted Mears a reprieve last
January, until a feasibility study for
its renovation and use could be comv
pleted.

Last spring, officials or the college
selected Ben Weese of the Chicago»
based Weese, Segers, Hickey, and
Weese, to draw up plans for renovar
tion and conversion, reported vice
Provost Ken Browning. “Ben was of
interest because of the work he’s done
at Cornell College, where they‘ve done
a lot of work with old buildings,” said
Browning

No plans have yet been drawn,
however, because “right after we
chose the architect, we chose a new
president," Browning revealed, “and
he wanted to get a feel of things
before he decided what to do with
Mears and Goodnow.”

Goodnow Hall, which was also
nominated to the Registry last spring,
houses the psychology department and
is also in need of improvements. One
plan, proposed by former President A,
Richard Turner, calls for Goodnow to
become the lungsneeded art gallery
and Mears to house the psychology
department.

President George Drake recently
announced his plan to form an Ad Hoc
Committee on Buildings and Grounds,
which will include four students, three
faculty members, and tour ad-
ministrators to look into possible uses
for the buildings,

“The committee will not just talk
about Mears," Drake said, “they will
be an advisory to me as [start to
think about the future space needs for
the buildings and grounds at Grins
nell."

The Mary Grinnell Mears Ladies
Cottage, designed by Charles D. Mar-
Vin. was built in 1008, the first
women’s dormitory on campus. It is
named after Mary Grinnell, an 1881
graduate of the college and daughter
of J.B. Grinnell, The large donation
for the cctmge's construction was
secured by her husband, the Reverend
DO. Mears,

Meal‘s housed 30 women when it
opened but an addition to the northern
wall in i903 brought the total to 54. A
porch, running along the entire south

face of the building, was removed durr
ing the 19205. At one time, the director
of food services and a women‘s library
was located on the tirst floor. It was
also the forerunner of offrcampus
cooperative housing, as the college
wanted the women to have a per
sonalized, family-style dwelling.

in last, the new library, named
after its benefactor. Edward A Good-
now, was the center of attention. The
building, designed by Stephen Earle, a
famous architect of the period, was
erected after a tornado devastated the
campus in 1882. Goodnow, a
parishioner of Rev, Mears, donated
$10,000 for the building and also
established ten permanent scholar-
ships of 360 for women

Approximately two years ago, the
trustees approved the demolition of
Mears, reportedly unaware that
nomination papers for the National
Register were near completion A
listing on the Register makes the col-
lege eligible to receive matching
grants for lull restoration or sym-
pathetic rehabilitation, However, it
does not force the retention of the
building unless federal monies become
involved.

The trustees based their first deci—
sion on the Grinnell College Housing
Study done by Dober and Associates in
1976. They concluded that
“rehabilitation is the most suitable
course of action” because, although
they did not see Mears as an outstan—
ding piece of architecture, they did
say it is “a graceiul building" and
“unique in style in the Grinnell area."

But along with the complimentary
comments, the report estimated the
rehabilitation cost at $849,500. The
trustees concluded that this figure was
too high for a restoration and that a
new structure should be built instead,

When history professor David Jor-
dan announced the plight of Mears
Cottage in the s S: 8 early last
November, another interesting issue
was also uncovered. He cited that the
college states in the current catalog
that its “BO-acre campus has 35
buildings which reflect the history and
growth of the institution ”

Jordan also pointed out that the col-
lege moved to Grinnell from its first
location in Davenport around the year
1859, nearly three decades before
Goodnow and Mears were built, He
also brought to light the fact that old
structures on campus are disappears
ing, leaving little of this link with the
past, These include Alumni Hall in
1958; Chicago Hall (the administration
building) In 1959; Blair Hall in 196‘;

and the Women’s Gym in 1972, all
within two decades.

By the end of November, students
organized an adrhoc Save Meal's Coma
mittee for the purpose or looking into
its possible uses,

in January, the trustees reversed
their prior ruling, calling for a
feasibility study for converting Mears
into the headquarters for the
psychology department. Then Presir
dent A. Richard Turner acknowledg»
ed, “We had been looking too blinding-
ly at Mears as a dorm. It's very fair
to say the thinking was not broad
gauged enough.

Meanwhile, the nomination oi Mears
and Goodnow to the National Register
proceeded from the state review board
to the national level. All the paper-
work was completed and the two
historic structures were officially
placed on the Register last spring on
April 5,

The future of Mears Cottage re-
mains uncertaln, although Drake does
have a few ideas about its possible
uses. He stresses that Mears ls
“definitely not to be used as sleeping
rooms; it will only be for daytime and
evening use."

Some of his ideas include using the
ground floor for a faculty lounge
and/or the trustees' meeting rooms
and the upper floors as seminar
rooms, study areas, or even FDR’s.
“All of my plans include getting rid oi
the north wing and rebuilding the
front porch to restore it to its original
cottage form,” he revealed.

Although both Browning and Drake
favor the rehabilitation of Mears, they
stressed that economics will be the
deciding factor. ”I want to be up front
about the fact that I'm in favor of save
ing Meal‘s," said Drake. “I think 15th
century buildings are beautiful, and
Mcars. although not a very good ex
ample, is certainly a link with the col-
lege’s 19th century past," he
reiterated.
