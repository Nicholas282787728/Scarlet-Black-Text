long as the student has either a check.
ing or savings account at the bank, He
said, “We recognize students have a

need to cash checks and so we provide

a system." He explained, “students
can have their checks authorized at
the college Treasurer's office." The
Treasurer's stamp identiﬁes the pei'e
son as a student and the office then
becomes responsible tor the check.
Mindi‘up added, “Iiwe do not have
that student's account and the check
he Cashes is bad, we lose the money.”

Mike Ryan. a Cashier at the Mount
Vernon Bank and Trust Company,
stated that bank’s policy [or students.
“Generally, we have to call the home
bank up. We've cooperated with Cor-
nell on larger checks that they can’t
handle for students.” A Customer ser»
vice representative at the First
Federal Slate Bank in Des Moines
said that bank will cash outeoletown
checks "with an lD."

Although bad checks do appear
from time to time, all of those bankers
interviewed agreed they were not a
mayor problem. In reference to “hot"
checks, Mindrup commented,
“Students are no greater problem
than others, I‘d guess perhaps even
less oi a problem " Jones stated,
“Over the past years, yes, there have
been some problems. It‘s difﬁcult to
say, but it's probably not a signiﬁcant
problem." He pointed out that bad
checks tend lo increase at the end of
the year "when students get going,"

Virgil Groth. coowner of McNally’s
Super Vain, remarked. “Generally. i
have no problem wilh cheeks it gets
sticky at the end or the year so we cut

0“ checks from local banks about two
weeks ahead of the end oi the
semester." Out-ol-town checks are
always acceptable, Groth said,
because students seem to be more
conscientious in maintaining checking
account balances at home banks,

He Said. “I'm not worried about
checks. We take a lot of them and
we're glad to do it The occasional bad
check is just a cost oi doing business,"
it a student does write a bad check,
Groth drops him a note and the stu-
dent generally takes care oi it.

Another local business has had a
harder time with student checks. Tom
Taylor, manager of Pizza Hut, told of
a new policy adopted by his regional
office to Curb bad checks. Up until two
months ago, Pizza Hut took out-of-
town checks for payment. “But now,
we don't accept any checks trom out
of town because we received so many
bad ones. We got maybe 10 to 15 every
two months, Probably hall of those
were college checks."

“The new policy really hasn't air
iected busmess," Taylor said, adding,
“Probably 50% at our business comes
from college students. ll an individual
does pass a bad check, our area oilice
gives 30 days tor the check to be pick-
ed up and then it's turned over to a
collection agency."

On campus, Grinnell College otters
two ”unoliicial” banks. Both the
Bookstore and the Treasurer's office
will cash student checks, Tom McBee,
manager of the Bookstore, allows
students to cash up to $20 per day in
checks. “t'm practically operating an
unoiticiai bank on campus, It's a ser-

vice, but it's a hassle," he explained.

McBee Cited three problems with _
handling student checks. First, “Bad
checks are always a nuisance and ‘
most are not taken care of very last. .
This ties up a good percentage of our-
money in “hot” cheeks. At the begin- -
ning and end of the year so much » -
money is tied up that it’s a real prob-_1
lem." He figured the Bookstore
handles “at least a Couple hundred"
dollars worth oi bad checks per ,
month,

McBee also mentioned the volume DI '
checks handled as the second
“hassle.” “Check cashing has increas
ed over the years,” McBee explained. .
“We now handle a couple or thousand «-
dollars worth of checks 3 day, so I
have to go to the bank two and
sometimes three times a day."

McBee has been concerned with the
amount oi change the Bookstore givés
out. “We end up the supplier or all
change on campus. We may have to
restrict the amount of change we can
give each student, though we would
prefer not to."

Ruth Palmer, Cashier in the
Treasurer’s office, said that while the
“office is not in business to be a bank,;
we cash checks it the money is
available. We have no definite max-
imum, though generally saoesso is the
most," She added that students can
cash third party checks, but “the ones
who cash the checks are responsible if
they bounce.

Palmer pointed out that even though
it has a higher maximum than the I
Bookstore, the Treasurer's ofiice does
not handle as large a volume of stu-
dent checks.
