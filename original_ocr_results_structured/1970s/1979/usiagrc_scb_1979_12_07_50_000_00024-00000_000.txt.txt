Grinnell does not offer the most
spoken language in the world, Further
than this, there are instructors in the
United States who speak both
Japanese and Chinese, With the
“competitive" salaries Grinnell offers,
it is possible that the combined
absence of Japanese and Chinese may
be filled by a fused Oriental languages
position,

The problem, as explained to me, is
not much one of funds; it is a problem
or placement in the faculty, A quota
regulates the amount of tenure-tract
positions (because of the foreboded
scarcity oi enrollmentin the 19805)
and thus Stabllzes the‘student to facul-
ty ratio. Conseoue'ntly, if a position is
added, another must be dropped.
Analyzing the priorities oi the school,
it does not seem probable that another
position will be relinquished in favor
oi an Oriental languages position The
point is, however, not all iaculty posi~
tions at Grinnell are tenuretract. So
by producing a nonrtenuretract 0rien~
tal languages position, students‘ needs
can be met so long as the demand
necessitates it. This does not mean the
interest in East Asian Studies or
Eastern languages is ephemeral, it is
simply a solution to the problem oi
usurplng another faculty position.

The theoretical problem with hiring
an Oriental languages instructor is the
Occidental nature of the Grinnell Col-
lege curriculum. This is the same
ethnocentrism so adamantly criticized
by the college catalog, This problem
of steeping oneselt in Western at—
titudes must some day come to an
end; its death has got to begin in the‘
liberal arts College A liberal arts coir
lege teaches a diversity oi topics and
how they correlate with the whole of
knowledge. How they correlate with
the Western whole, that is. In the
seventh decade of the twentieth cen~
tury, we all know the world is not ilat,
So, then, why do we still teach a rigid-
ly piece-meal concept of the whole?
True amplification of the purposes of
the liberal arts education would
endeavor to bridge the gap between
Orient and Occident. This is vital and
altogether necessary tor a true con-
cept oi the whole and a sincere liberal
arts format.

For the students who have chosen
East Asian Studies as their primary
area of interest, the only alternative

upon return to Grinnell (it they do
return) is to study the language
heuristically or commute to another
ischool. l petition the response of the
Curriculum Committee, the Executive
Board. the student and iaculty com—
munity, and President Drake who
himself “hopes to amplify the pur~
poses of the liberal arts education at
Grinnell,” It was little more than 130
years ago when Hor‘aée Greeley turns
ed to J.B, Grinnell and said, “Go west,
young man." He encouraged Grinnell
to explore the frontiers of the land and
the intellect, Now, men and women,
let’s go east.
