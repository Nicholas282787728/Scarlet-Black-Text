Editorial poorly written

To the editor:Dan Flynn’s November
23 editorial attacking the 136:5 was
poorly written. Though I don’t defend
the 35:5, I believe that any criticism
of it should be valid and well-
substantiated. The only constructive

' criticism Flynn offered was that the

piece on Ted Kennedy appearing in
the 3&5 “lacks logic and coherence"
In fact, this is the only 5&5 article
mentioned in the entire editorial.
Flynn doesn't back up his claims

that the B&S ls a “tasteless ego
trip" .a product of a narrow- minded,
self righteous bigoted group of peo-
ple. " Epithets like these should not be
.thrown around without carefully con
sidering their meanings and justifying
their use. In Flynn’s reality, the
'BhSers are also “a group of terribly
immature children" On what does he
base this statement? He certainly
doesn‘t cite examples from 8&3 ar»
ticles to back up this charge. ‘
Flynn’s Criticism of the 8&5
dcgenerates into an attack on the
writers of the 3515. He states,

. of the 5&8 contained perhaps the most

timely and perceptive editorial ol the
year thus far. David Blatt's warning
of economically tighter times ahead is
appropriate for every American
citizen. But to the upper middle class
college student it is especially mean-
ingful, because it is here that expecta-
tions tend to be the highest. The
history of the economy has been
growth in the private sector, growth
which provides wealth and comfort for
young opportunists like ourselves. As
this growth slows, as eventually it

contrary to the status quo. Idon't
think I would be exaggerating too
much to say that our nation is ex

uEﬁzsers are concerned with one
thing: egostripping.” Because one per-
son spilled beer in the Forum, Flynn
deduces that this individual and all
lasts writers are trying to “screw
everyone else!" Flynn also marvels
that this same individual “has the gall
to have once served as judicial council
chairman" Perhaps Flynn means
that this person had “the gall" to spill
beer, but does he mean he had “the
gall” to serve on the judicial council".
If so. he should have clarified the
statement.

Bravo on 36.? editorial!

To the editor: Reading last week’s
3&5, I was amazed by the offensive
nature at the contents. I believe that

n “underground newspaper is a
legitimate alternative for student ex-
pression, however, the poor quality of
the 8515 does not fulfill this function.
If student energy and funds are going
to be directed to such an effort, the

must, the effects cannot help but be
felt.

It is a bit premature, though. to
forecast a bankruptcy of liberalism
upon this inevitable trend. Liberalism
in the political sense does not always
imply “high goals" or wastefulness;
and the very real problems to which
he refers and calls liberalism or high
expectations can perhaps best be
cured by political means which have
been given the label “liberal,” Many
major European countries whose
“scarcity" problems are much worse
than ours have governments that tend

The editor replies: Last week’s
editorial presupposed two things on
the part of the reader: average in-
telligence and knowlege as to the con-
tent ol the lasts. To most who posess
these prerequisites, the line of reason»

But the expansiveness and high expec-
cations which characterize American
business and economics are complete
ly foreign to them, stability is valued
over growth; and stability, according
to many, is what the US. should seek
in the 19805.
This is why political liberalism may
be exactly the cure for today‘s
economic problems. Perhaps rather
than the opportunism characterized by
investment and industrial growth
which were typical of the Hoover era,
we need an inwardly-directed clean-up

time of FDR has been increased

As B att points out, this was a hallmark

when he says that “nothing substan
