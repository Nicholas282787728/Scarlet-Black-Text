must talk oniissues

The upcoming weeks promise to be very important for the
future of the college.

As the search for A. Richard Turner‘s successor begins,
and as the faculty considers changes in the grading system
and curricular requirements, a unique opportunity is
presented to shape the course of the college for years to
come.

EACH OF THE decisions facing the college require dif
ferent ways of responding and the Board of Trustees, faculty
and students must maintain a dialogue as these decisions are
resolved.

Fortunately, the faculty recognizes the importance of
communication in regard to the presidential Search. The
recently elected members of the faculty search committee all
share one important characteristic: they are known and
trusted by the Board.

FURTHERMORE, THE committee members were
nominated primarily because they will serve well as conduits
between the Board's committee and the faculty.

The faculty, then, has taken positive steps towards
keeping lines of communications open in its first efforts to
advise the Board on a selection of a new President.

STUDENTS MUST DO likewise. A student search
committee, preferably affiliated‘ with SGA, should be
established very soon to insure that students are closely
involved in the selection of a new President,

The faculty has also taken positive steps to solicit student

‘ opinions regarding the future of the college’s curriculum. The
Curriculum committee has spent considerable time in recent
weeks soliciting student and faculty opinions on its
proposals.

ONE CAN CERTAINLY disagree with the committee’s
draft report, particularly with the proposal for distributional
requirements. But the committee cannot be faulted for
ignoring student opinion concerning the proposals.

The proposal for changing the grading system has not
progressed sufficiently through the school bureaucracy for
any substantive proposal to be offered. But when a proposal
appears, the same attempt at student-faculty dialogue
should be made.

COMMUNICATION, HOWEVER, is a two way street.
The Board and the faculty cannot be expected to give full
consideration to student opinion if the students show no
interest in the affairs of the college.

There is considerable cause, however, to be pessimistic
about how much interest students really do have in what’s
going on around them. Grinnellians are justifiably wary of
play-acting as “radicals.” But in seeking to avoid yesten
day’s cliches, many have rejected political involvement of
any kind.

IN THE END, the amount of input the Board and the
faculty receives on these matters depends on the amount
students wish to offer. The faculty has begun the task of
meeting the challenges of the future with a suitable emphasis
on dialogue. Students should do the same.

Letters to the editor.

Letters assail Warner’s attack on Peterson

To the editor: I was shocked and
outraged by the printing oi Ray
Warner's letter in the 8545. Mr,
Warner’s attack on Mr. Peterson
points out the dangers oi viewing
athletics at Grinnell as one would
View them at Ohio State, The
publishing of the letter also raises
questions about the ethics and
policies of the editors of the 5&3.

Mr Warner wrongly assumed
that Mr. Peterson's position at
Grinnell is basketball coach. Mr.
Peterson is an Assistant Professor
of Physical Education. The duties
of that position include teaching
activity classes, teaching theory
courses, college committee
responsibilities as well as two
other coaching positions.

Mr. Peterson is a member of
Grinnell’s faculty, just as a biology

To the editor: After reading Ray
Warner's article on the basketball
team I decided to follow his
example of criticizing the Grinnell
system and express a few of my
own criticisms.

I too have a son at Grinnell and
he is a great student. When I saw
his grades last semester I was
astonished. How could someone
give my young scholar a “D”? In
all his other classes in high School
he only got “A’s” and I only heard
good things about him. He never
does anything wrong and I don’t
see how anybody can embarass my
son by giving him such a low
grade. Why, I can remember
teacherrparent night for his high
school. After everybody had left,
my husband and I sat around with
my son's biology teacher (biology
was his favorite class) and a case
or two of Jack Daniel’s and just
talked about how well my son was
doing and what a fine boy he was
I’ve seen a lot of classes and I don’t
know oi anyone in which my boy
can merit a “D” grade. I think
someone irom the Grinnell powers
thatrwould-bc should review the
situtation and eliminate the “bad
apples in the basket."

Another point is the way that lhe
labs are run. My son told me that in
his Biology 101 class the teacher
dumpedformaldehyde on him. The
nerve of him! He never came home
from his other labs with stained
Clothes! How can such an in'
competent beallowcd to leach such
fine student? This is another area
that I feel should be investigated

In Closing I would like to thank
lhis paper lor allowing ihe con.
cei-reo parents oi Grlnncll students
to L‘xorcss (llelr VIEWS so lllélt our
children will only got the best,

.lcl‘f "Malina" Greenbel'g

or political science icacher. His
hiring, promotion and dismissal
are subject to the same procedures
as other faculty members. These
procedures must be vigorously
iollowed in order to protect the
independence and academic
freedom of all faculty.

Mr. Warner, Grinnell is not the
New York Knicks or Notre Dame.
We are not in the business of
athletics. We are in the business of
education, and that education
includes physical education and
athletics.

The 8518‘s decision to print Mr.
Warner's letter must be
questioned. It is no more than
slander. His vicious personal at-
tack on Mr. Peterson and his “soap
opera” writing style have no more
place in a college newspaper than
my critical expose of Mr. Warner's

sex life,

Mr. Warner is not a member of
the college community and his
letter should have been forwarded
to the National Enquirer. The 5&5
editors must have forgotten the
phrase ”responsible journalism."

The printing of Mr. Warner’s
letter further emphasizes the
importance of reaffirming Grin-
nell’s commitment to physical
education as a part of liberal arts
education, Athletics must never
become a “win at any cost“ ac-
tivity at Grinnell and faculty
members must be judged by more
than their won-lost record, Mr.
Warner’s letter is nothing more
than the tirade of a Little League
father whose son didn't get to pitch
and bat fourth. It should have been
awarded the Same consideration.

Students must speak up

To the editor: A couple of weeks
ago the student supported co—ed
bathroom policy was rejected by
the administration. Last week the
faculty removed its support irom
Skip Day. At present, changes are
being considered in both course
and distributional requirements,
and the grading System without
apparent concern for student
opinion.

Here are three changes in
college policy made, or being
made, without regard to the
opinions of the students who will be
affected by those changes.

Actually, the Skip Day issue
doesn’t belong in this letter, since
Skip Day will lake place with or
without the Support of the faculty,
and is probably better off without
it. I monlioo it only to appease all
the students who have been crying
into their beers about the
“treason” Committed by the profs.

The other two issues, however,
are more to the point. The
bathroom policy is unimportant in
itself (since co—ed floors always
end up wilh co—ed bathrooms
anyway), but it has given rise to so
much discussion about the attitude
ol the administration toward the
Student body The problem of
whether college sludenls are
adulls or children was well»
discussed in the SM! editorial of
two weeks ago.

We can vote, we can be drafted,
and most of us can drink (these
seem to be society’s criieria for
adulihoodl; and yet. at eemingly
orbilrai-y points, somcty ncluding
Gl‘innell College, decides that

 
 

college-aged students are not
responsible adults. It seems
reasonable to demand that they
make up their minds one way or
the other

The last issue is as important in
itself as are the questions which
arise irom it. Why haven't students
been asked how they feel about
course and distributional require-
ments? Doesn't the administration
care how the students (who. after
all, are the ones affected by any
changes) feel? Is this a sign of
things to come? Are we to have no
say in anything?

There are two ways to approach
the situation: one can look at the
college as a community or one can
see it as a business. I’ve heard both
many times.

If Grinnell is a community,
doesn’t the largest segment of the
community have a right to some
say in the government? If
Grinnell is a business, don‘t the
customers havea right to complain

'about and institute changes in the
services rendered, short of
leaving?

Of course, the administration's
aniliide is not the only problem,
Perhaps an even bigger problem |S
that of (he passive acceptance
idare I say apathy”) on the part oi
lhe students. We cannot expect to
be listened to if we are not heard.
and in order to be heard one must
say something. We can’t say it will
do no good until we lry,

I beg each of you to express any
opinions you may have about
college policies in any manner
possible. Valerie Lloyd
