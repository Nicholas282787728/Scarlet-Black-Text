Forum on food prices

by Alex Sachs

For a number of years the Forum
Grill has been a convenient refuge
from the dining hall blues and sudden
pangs of hunger Now, however the
popularity of the Grill may he
threatened by price increases which
average 23- 25% on most items

The price hikes, according to .
Food Service Director Dave McCon-
nell, have been imposed due to inﬂation
alone. In a period of one year grouno
beel prices, for example have gone
from $1.10 to $1.61 per pound on the
market. “We set pricing based on
market value and on the basis that the
Forum is self-sustaining and must
break even " McConnelEgged.
McConnell added that the price hikes
may seem especially steep because of
his policy of not raising prices during
the school year, but allowing them to
be increased' in a lump sum after the
summeri . ‘

The possibilities of the self-
sufficiency of the Forum may be in
jeopardy even with the price hikes.
Thr Grill has decreased its annual
debt significantly in the past several
years, to the point of being only $2, 000
in the red last year.

of no price hikes during the academic
year, the Forum could soon ﬁnd itself
in financial trouble.

Economics even plays a part in the
selection of the menu at the Grill. On
several occasions, new items have
been offered, but have not been
popular enough to be economically
viable. An example ot such ex-
perimentation was a salad bar which

was patronized by only about eight
persons day.

The Grill serves a basic snack
bar type menu, with yogurt and bagels
as more exotic offerings. The Food
Service is always receptive to suggw
tions, and studies the practicality of
the better ideas offered, McConnell
said.

When compared to various eating
establishments, the Forum‘s prices
seem to be in somewhat the same
range, A Quarter Founder at
McDonald’s is more expensive than
the Grill’s hamburgers. The Grill's
tuna sandwich costs a nickel more
than at Peppercorn's Deli, and hot

dogs are 60 cents at both
establishments

Beefburgers at Jerry's Koffee Shoppe
are 75 cents as opposed to as cents at
the Forum.

McConnell points out that most
employees in downtown restaurants
earn the minimum wage ($2.90 per
hour), while experienced college help
can earn $5.50 per hour including in
inge benefits. The Clientele on which
the Forum draws is also much smaller
than downtown, with only 1,200 per»
sons in the college community as op-
posed to 9, 000 or so prospective
customers downtown All of these fac»
tors tend to increase the price 0i
operating.
