by Eric Rasmussen

Next week's convocation will teature

poets Paul and Hauling Engle. Their
topic will be: “The Unknown China:
Art and Culture in the People’s
Republic,”

The Engles, who jointly rounded the
International Writing Program at the
University or lowa. have just returned
from China. They were the first

writers from the United States allowed

to travel and visit without restrictions.
They spoke with writers, dancers, and
artists (who had been silenced for
years), high government oiricials, and
Hualing's relatives, whom she had not
seen for 30 Years.

“We had insighb into China that
foreign correspondents cannot get,"
Engle asserted, “because they have
no relatives, do not get into homes,
and do not, as we did, talk with
children and artists,”

They found that China is now rever-
sing its policies in almost all fields.
According to the Eagles. China is star-
ting what may be a “Second Cultural
Revolution" or a “Second Liberation
of China.” They have written about
meir trip in Newsweek, and are now
preparing a major article on the new
China for the Reader's Digest.

The Eagles will use color slides
taken in unusual places, such as
backstage at the Peking Theater, and
tapes of previously unrecorded music,
to'illustrate their talk.

Brezhneviand What Next?" yester-
day morning in Herrick Chapel.

As a United Press International cor-
respondent in Moscow from 1933 to
1973, Shapiro covered all of the major
developments in the Soviet Union, in
cluding the Five Year Plans, the rise
of Stalin’s dictatorship, the Soviet
Union in World War II, the Cold War,
the rise and fall DI Khruschev, and the
Brezhnev era.

attributes to the irresponsibility oi the
Stall, Levy said that the staff was
composed of many people who lacked
commitment to the book, and thus.
most of the work was thrust upon the
editor alone.

Due to this lack of organization,
many persons did not know where to
purchase yearbooks, a factor which
automatically held down sales, Levy
said, Last year's lack oi sales is likely
to be an important consideration in
the decision reached in the SPSrR
meeting this afternoon.

Levy plans to counter this argument
by pointing out what he tools is the
superior organization of this year's
yearbook stali. He has chosen friends,
whom he teels he can trust most, to be
the assistant editors of the Grinnell
Book. '

Levy also plans to impose strict
guidelines about the yearbook opera
tion, where there were none last year.

In addition to this lecture, Shapiro
will meet with students interested in
journalism today, at 4:15 pm. in
Grinnell House. The veteran journalist
will deliver a short talk and field ques-
tions irom the audience

Shapiro will conclude his meetings
at Grinnell with an informal discus»
sion of me prospects tor the SALT ll

treaty, tomorrow, before a Parents‘
Weekend audience in South Lounge.

Levy [eels he has an adequate staff.
An organizational meeting drew 15 in-
terested students. with 20~25 other who
could not attend the meeting express-
ing interest.

If the SPSrR were to deny funding to
the Grinnell Book, Levy states he
would appeal to the student body for
support through tuna-raising to meet
the monetary deadlines of the year-
book publishers, and publish a book
without SGA support.

Marilyn Clark, chairwoman of
SPBzR, feels that Levy would have no
authority to attempt to publish a book
on his own because ultimate control
over publications rests in her commit-
tee.

This issue needs only to be discussed
if the committee votes against the
allocation of money to the yearbook in ‘
today’s meeting. The meeting is open
to all interested parties,
