"Jocks ﬁght'apathy, seek own dorm

Sports editor F Roben Sidon H

with so signatures gathered so far
and 100 expected, a group at athletes
on campus petitioning President
George Drake for its own car
educational dormitory. Like the
members of Quiet Hall, or the Black
Community, or any other group pro-
ject house, the athletes want to live
together and represent a common

goal,
The petitioning athletes came to

Grinnell expecting a “total"
academic-athletic education, Now,
many are disappointed enough they
are considereing a transfer. “The ma
jor problem," says organizer Mike
Cetina, “is the attitude towards
athletics at this school; no one gives a
damn "

Cetina. like many of the other
serious athletes on campus, came
from a high school where athletics
were important, “At Grinnell," says
Cetina, “the athlete is discriminated
against.” To Cetina and the other petv
itioners, athletics should mean more
than what they do Grinnell.

Many of the athletes who signed the
petitiontand in particular, those who ,
are football players), now feel that the
college admissions representatives
lied to them when they spoke of a
substantial athletic program at Grin~
nell, “Even it they do pretenotpinhave
an athletic program,” says Ceti a,
”they can’t deny that there is veryilitr
tie moral support and no school
spirit." The athletic dorm will hopeful-
ly represent a show of strength
against the “antirsports” attitude
which prevails at Grinnell.

Many (not all) of the athletes who
signed the petition for an athletic
dorm ieel an antagonism between
those students on campus who play
sports and those who do not. Many oi
the good high school athletes who have
come to Grinnell feel that this an
tagonism (which is most prevalent in
the dorm) has “defused” much of
their enthusiasm for athletics.

By living and interacting
cooperatively within their own dorm,
the athletes expect to gain from each

other's enthusiasm [or sport. And
because the athletes who have signed
this petition (including approximately
25% women) come trom a widely
diverse backgrounds and represent a
wide variety of academic and extra-
curricular activities, they feel that in
the long run they will discredit the
“dumb jock Stereotype,” Says Cetina,
“May the rest of the school simply
realize that what sets us apart is our
love for sport.”

Many of the auiletes who want to
live in the Athletic Hall fear that if
some sort or public gesture is not exr
pressed (like the Athletic Hall), there
will be a decrease in the future enrollr
ment at prospective student athletes
The athletes who signed the petition
seem most concerned thh Grinnell’s
win-loss recored in what they consider
“major" sports—football, basketball,
and baseball. The athletes State that
the intensity in which these programs
are run is “lackadaisical " They
believe that if something is not done
soon, the situation will only get worse.
