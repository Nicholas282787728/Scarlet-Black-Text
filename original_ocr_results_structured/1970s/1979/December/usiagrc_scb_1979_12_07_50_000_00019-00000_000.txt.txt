Popsicle dreams:
So sweet to the taste,
So tantalizing to the touch,
Come in a rainbow of colors.
Popsicle dreams
Are nice;
You can savor them slowly,
Letting the cold
Trickle satisfyingly down your
throat
But,
On hot summer days
Popsicle dreams
Melt
And slip through your fingers,
Making dirty drops on the '
sidewalk.

Here is
your cross

Every humanbeing can be
a princess
The coarse, crude, ugly, dumb,
Fat, dull, pleasant, mad;
Wasted years, Selfish tears,
Only the bigoted are sad.

A Boy

lnnocence of a boy

Rod in hand

And thoughts of no other rod
Or Concubine;

When I was young,

Was I, yes, I remember,

Every flower was a five minute
under

And all day l could walk

Along river banks

With no thoughts.

Hatred, revenge, pain,
Every day closing every door;
Consuming time, lood, energy;
I have a sadly datedrbrain
