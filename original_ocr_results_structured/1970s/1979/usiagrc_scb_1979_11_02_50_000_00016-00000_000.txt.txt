TUCK scnoof.
Case vs. Theory

lt is generally agreed that the overall
objective oi an MBA education is to
prcpnrc students tor responsible carccrs
as managers However, the question at
which methods a school should use to
achieve this objective ccntinucs to
arouse discussion and debate. For some
academicians and many practitioners,
the answer is to give students a thorough
understanding ot current business prac-
tices and n massivli exposure to practicc
in making management decisions in both
real and simulutcd environments. For
others, particularly some acadcmicians.
the obicctivc is In cram studcnts lull oi
skills. tcchniqucs, theories. and prin—
ciplzs. Indeed, much ot the discussion
among academicians and practitioners
has tslrcn placc in terms at these two
polar vicws of how s school ought to
prepare people tor carccrs ln manage-
mlnt.

For Tuck, however. the argument of
theory vs. ractice involves n his: di-
'chotmny. e School believes Ihat both
are important and must he a part ot a
successful program. Theories, tools, and

rinciples are vital components of an

EA curriculum. As change erodes existv
lng practices and builds up nrw and
diﬂerenl challenges, nothing is more
practical or relevant than sound theory.
But theory by ltscll is not enough. The
hallmark of the cﬂectivz manager is to be
able to apply theory in ways that load to
sound judgments and dzciiions.
