Milking the cows
for all they’ re worth

“‘9 city kids know where milk
comes from it Comes from
grocery stores Packaged in
brightly colored cartons bearing
names like Wanler's and Borden’st
it costs close to two dollars a gallon
and tastes essentially like water.
True, our parents speak with
distance in their eyes oia day when
someone called the “milkman”
would bring the stuii to your front
door. True also that they claim the
milk was so rich you could skim
pure cream off the top of every
bottle

However. having grown old and
wise. we view such Claims with
skepticism no less than we
question the rhetoric of our early
impressionable clays suggesting
that milk comes, ultimately, from
cows

At live o‘clock every morning
and again in the evening, Raffety’s
so milk cows liie placidiy into the
milking barn where dairy herds
man Joe Hedric patiently awaits
them When one of the three
milking stalls presents itseli, the
cow pluds methodically in. Hedric
cleans her udders with a spray ol
water and then attaches them to
the milking machine.

THE MILK FLOWS directly
irom her lengthy bovine nipples to
the stainless steel holding tank
where it is Cooled until pick-up
every other day by a truck lrom
the State Center Coop. Some of the
milk is made into cheese there and
some oi it is shipped to Des Moines

where it eventually linds Its way to
the grocer s shelt

Anybody energetic enough to
rise at live in the morning or
willing to risk being late tor dinner
is welcome to watch the milking
process. Herdsman Hedric is
always writing to share what's
going on “The old ones are used to
it,” he says, “They just file right on
in " He gives a little shout it a cow
hesitates while entering or leaving
the stall, but most cooperate. It
takes a little less than two hours to
milk all so cows, and each yields
between three and tour gallons per

milking.
ALTHOUGH RAFFETY'S is one

area, he also grows soy beans and

RAFFETY RECALLS his child-

father‘s cows by hand. “Now," he
says, “the right muscles aren‘t in
shape, It would take weeks [or my
hands to acclimate."

into the dairy business should
ligure on spending $1,000 per head
