torial debut and is entirely in Polish
with English subtitles.

_ The plot Sounds thin, but Polanski
,goes much deeper. He brings out the
‘ 'co'nflict between the two men and

gradually intensifies it to the point

where the husband believes he has
killed the hitchhiker. The
cinematography is superb, unusual

shots and angles catching every bit oi
action. Time Magazine said, “Every
twitch of an eyelid tells a small, Sting-
ing truth."

It isn’t a very exciting iilm and the
action is slow, It's very subtle, with
Polanski letting the story he told
almost entirely through the fine acting
and revealing cinematography. No
great extravaganza unfolds before
your eyes, the audience is made to

John Paul and his peers

Over the last week or so, the only
news of any concern here in lowa
(other than the ever-present and
always captivating hog futures) has
been the upcoming visit of Pope John

Paul II.

t V This is fine with me, but What of the
other important events which are be-
ing denied coverage in favor of the
pontiff scoop? What about Ethyl Mer»
man’s latest l.p., “Disco Diva?" What
about the Violence at the annual weeks
'lohg veal loaf festival in Middletown,
Connecticut? What about the New
York Mets'!

Just because the pope may only be
the most charismatic leader of our
time, a man able to assemble the
world's masses at his beck and call, a
man capable of establishing true
peace in our time, so what? What’s so
hot about that? I can Count ten
religious figures on one hand, more
powerlul and important than Pope
12min Paul, Here’s just a sample:

Pope Ignatius "Bix" Cacopllonous
the 15!: Though he‘s not known very
well for his short term as pope (two
weeks in August. 1953, when Pope Pius
went on a spinrcasting vacation in
Missouri), Bix did achieve some ac-
claim as the first coronetist in the
Vatican City jazz band, the “Sin
Stompers Five."

He was more noted tor his work in
updating the celebration oi the Roman
Catholic Mass by replacing the
Gregorian chant of the Liturgy with
“scat Singing" (the
‘bee-bee-bop~ skeeedop‘ made famous
by Louis Armstrong and Ella
Fizgerald). His popularity diminished,
however, when a wave of renewed in:
terest in ragtime swept the Catholic
church,

Charles Zack: A longshoreman from
Trenton, New Jersey, who once cap:
tured the attention of the local news
media with claims of being visited
(several times in one week, no less)

by the Holy Spirit, when asked for
proof, Zack replied that the third
member oi the Holy Trinity was in his
house at the very moment, but
couldn't come out to talk with
reporters because he was “suffering
from a bad cold.“

One camera man, claiming he was a
large housefly on his way to buzz
around the light in the second floor
bathroom, was allowed into the house,
