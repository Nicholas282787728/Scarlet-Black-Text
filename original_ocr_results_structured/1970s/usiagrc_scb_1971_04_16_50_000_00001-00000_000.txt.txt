Faculty Minority Blocks Change

Fifteen faculty members out
of an estimated sixty effect
ively vetoed Monday an at’
tempt by Charles Seller, reg‘
istrar, to eliminate all Satur-
day classes for next year,

The fifteen voted for the in-
vocation of the Rule of 12 by
which any twelve faculty mem-
bers can delay a vote for one
week on a matter which is be-
fore the faculty for the first
time.

Seller told the faculty before
the vote that if no action were
taken at that meeting, time
limitations would force him
to proceed with plans for next
year including Saturday c135,
ses. ,

Nevertheless the fifteen v0.
ted to delay action thus ef—
fectively killing the plan with-
out a vote.

One rationale for the votewas
that the faculty did not have
enough hard data (such as at~

tendance records for Satur-
day classes) to make an intel-
ligent decision. There was
some opposition to the plan
because of the beliefthat some
disciplines, especially the
languages, would have diffi-
culty with the hour and a half
classes that would be neces-
sary Tuesdays andThursdays.

Chairman of the Faculty
Beryl C10tfelter officially
moved the Executive Council's
reorganization plan whichwas
printed in the 5&8 last week.

President Glenn Leggett 5p,
oke to the proposal, mention-
ing seven concerns he hadwith
reorganization, six points of
agreement with the EC plan
and two points of disagrees
ment with the plan.

His seven concerns include
one that reorganization pro
vide for increased student itr
put in order to increase studr
ent morale and to decrease

student feelings of alienation
from the collegeand its struc-
tures.

Other concerns are that re
organization leave personnel
decisions in the hands of the
faculty, alleviate the admin
isirative burden on the fac-
ulty, provide thepresidentand
the deans with organized and
welln supported inputs and re
cognize that the president and
deans are faculty members.

In addition, he hopes the
plan will be detailed, clear
and concise and that it will
have widespread and basic
support.

Leggett agreed with many
parts of the plan: he espec-
ially liked the facts that den
cisions on divisionalreorgnn-
ization and faculty member
ship on campus committees
were postponed, that depart»
ment chairmen are to have a

Ahmad Attacks War, Repression

by Bill Knecht

Dr. Eqbal Ahmad, one of the
Harrisburg 6 accused of con-
spiring ”to kidnap the heating
system in the Pentagon and to
blow up Henry Kissinger,"
spoke to a capacity audience
Tuesday afternoon in the South
Lounge.

Ahmad delivereda twonpron-
ged thrust at his indictors and
their involvement in the Indo»
china War, claiming that the
Harrisburg 6 are the victims
of a presidential move ”de
signed to test out your toler-
ance to repression."

Ahmad’s first barb flew at
the charges brought to bear
on him, as he proclaimed to
be “amazed" at the "extra-
ordinary power of sedition,"
of the government. “Wemight
as well have eloped with Mar-
tha Mitchell," he said, speak-
ing of the charged conspiracy
to kidnap Kissinger.

His secondthrustaccusedtbe
President and his civilian and
military advisers of involving
themselves in an illegal and
immoral war in Asia. Ahmad
challenged the proceedings of
the Galley trial on the grounds
that Nixon and his men were
just as guilty of war crimes
as the man on trial.

Ahmad saw a link between his
own indictment and the IndoV
china "Viemamization" pro-
gram. Nixon inherited LBJ’s
war and the realization that
the people would not tolerate
it, he said. Therefore, to save
his own political skin while
still trying to win the war, he
instituted the Vietnamization
program, which is no more
than a transparent attempt to
minimize perceived U.S. par-
ticipation by the substitution
of American aircraft for gr~
ound troops and the substitut
tion of South Vietnamese bur
dies for American ones. In
diis way, he feels that Nixon
hopes to continue the waruntil
the NLF is defeated.

Ahmad feels thatNixon, much
in the same way LBJ probed
the American limits of toler-

ance to war, is probing the
limits of tolerance to repres-
sion. Furthermore, he is af—
raid that, as Nixon was able
to discover in Vietnamiza‘
tion a method of covering up
involvement in war, he will
also discover methods to 5h,

ade the political repression
perceived by many to be going
on this very moment.

Nixon already has found three
“cards," Ahmad stated, and
is preparing to use them ag-
ainst the Harrisburgé shortly.
He said that invoking the “un-
democratic" and “highly re-
pressive" Conspiracy Laws,
by selecting an area of the
country in which jury mem-
bers are likely to prejudiced
against activists of the ilk
of The 6, and by wielding the
awesome “power of persua-
sion" of the government, Ni-
xon might be able to get a
conviction in spite of the pro-
fessed innocence of the ac-
Cused.

Ahmad finished his speech by
importuning students to pre-
sent themselves to the Presi-
dent in Washington on April
24th and to keep an eye on the
proceedings of the Harrisburg
6 trial. He was greetedbysus-
rained applause from the aud~
ience. A collection was taken,
and anti-war publimtions
were sold to raise funds for
the trial, whose costs may hit
the $500,000 mark before the
smoke clears.

H C Rules Changed

President Glenn Leggett has
approved a recommendation of
the Student’faculty Committee
on Student Services to revise
the visitation regulations at
the Younker Memorial Health
Center to be effective imme-
diately.

The new regulations are to
be implemented for the rest
of this semester on a trial
basis. If no difficulties arise,
it is expected that they will
become permanent.

Under the new regulations,
there will be two hours of
visitation per day instead of
one, and there may be two
visitors a day instead of one.
The most welcome change is
that visitors may be either
male or female.

The staff retains the right to
ask visitors to leave; patients
have the option of declining
visitors, and some seriously
ill or very contagious patients
may be denied visitors.

Patients may receive only
one visitor at a time.
