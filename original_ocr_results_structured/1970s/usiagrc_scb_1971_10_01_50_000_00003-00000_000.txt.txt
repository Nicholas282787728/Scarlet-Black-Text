 

Christian MovemeniL Growing

by John Wylie

Christianity is a vibrant and
growtng movcment on the
Grinnell College campus. Bc~
ginning frotn a nucleus of just
three or fourpeoplefiveyears
ago, the number of Grinncll
Christians has now grown to
about forty. In the words of
Phil Frank, one of the Chris
tian leaders, "Forty out of
1250 students doesn‘t sound
that good. But when you cons
sider that a few years ago
there were only three or four,
that becomes very promi-
sing.”

Fundamentalist is the word
most often used to describe
the scriptural doctrine upon
which the Grinnell Christian
movement is based. The lean
ders ofthe movementallagree
that the whole basis for their
beliefs is a fairly literal in-
terpretation of the Holy Bi—
ble.

The student body as a whole
has several opportunities each
week to see the Christian
movement in action. Tom Gil-
bert, Scott Wellman, and Phil
Frank run a radio program
called ”the JesusThing"each
Sunday afternoon from 4 to
7 on KDIC. The producers
are uncertain as to the act
tual response to their pres
gram, since they have re
ceived only three phone calls
while on the air, but they feel
that the program is definitely
worth the effort.

Tom Gilbert commented, "A
lot of people are probably
listening because weplay good
music. The difference is that
we comment on how each song
relates to the Lord Jesus...
if it mentions Christ we talk
about what it is saying, and
if it is sayingsomethingwhich
disagrees With the Chris an
viewpoint, we say why we

disagree. We try to keep our
messages short,..it it hard to
listen to a long rehearsed
speech."

The Christians are loosely
organized through the Grinnell
Christian Fellowship. Connie
Ericson, secretary of the gr-
oup, spoke about some of the
ways in which Christians are
uniting in fellowship and get-
ting the message of Jesus to
others who are not Christians.

"It is basically a matter of
outreach A drawing otherpeOs
ple into the Fellowship of
Christ." WhenaskEdifshehad
had a personal religious exV
perience, she said, “it is all
a matter of how you know
God. Maybe this example will
help. i know ‘that President
Nixon exists, but I don't real-
ly know him. I used to krtow
that God existed. Now i know
him. But you must remember
“you accept a. friendship with
God on His terms, because
He created us and He is the
one who is without sin."
There are two Bible Studies
organized by the group for

 

 

people who are not ChriStians
or whowouldlike to knowmore
about Jesus Christ.

In addition, five fellowship
groups meet daily for prayer
and Bible Study. The purpose
is to help the members grow
in their knowledge of Jesus
Christ and in their obedience
to Him. The entire group gar
thers for prayer on Sun-
day afternoons, and is trying
to grow as a Christian 00ml
munity in all areas of life.
According to Connie, "We feel
that we have something to
share and we want to share
it in love."

To Tom, one cannot be pas-
sive about God and still have
a relationship with Him. “If
more people would honestly
seek the Lord there would be
more people who believe in
Jesus. The search is essen-
tial - you won't find God uni
less you search_for him."

Christianity will continue to
grow on the Grinnell campus
according to all the Chris*
tians I spoke to. Each has
his or her own ideas as to
how Christianity affects
everyday life. Phil summed
up his mission as a Christian
at Grinnell this way: "To
grow closer to God and to be
open to talking to Other peo
ple about the Lord."

Joint Board Recommends

Need More EPC Student Power

by Don Dagenais

The two main attractions in
the South Lounge last Monday
night were a TV football game
and the Joint Board mecting.
The football game won out on
the basis of spectator attenr
tion 10-[, but the Joint Board
probably get more things ac
complished.

The House Presidents dealt
with a couple of important
matters— the problem of in—
adequate student voting power
on Divisional EPC’s and the
possibility of making the Socs
ial Coordinator's position an
elective onessand at least one
minor problem, that of the
missing fire hydrant cap.

Fire Hydrant

It seems that Chief Petersis
a bit disturbed as of late. The
cap from one of the downtown
hydrants is missing, and he
suspects a student is behind
the deed. SGA President Shel-
ley Floyd, noting that the cap
was removed without spilling
any of the water, said that
the Chief "was reallyimpres-
sod" with the neat job but
would like to have it back
just the same.

Student Coordinator Terry
Clifford opened the lengthi-
est discussion of the evening
by suggesting that the posi-
tion of Social Coordinator be
made elective. Noting that
students have been disturbed
about the selection of musical
groups for campus concerts,
she said that “the Committee
really doesn’t represent the
students."

The Social Coordinator is
presently chosen each spring
by the outgoing SGA cabinet,
the incoming SGA President,
and the outgoing Social Coor-
dinator. This year’s Social
Coordinator is Ed Levine;
Terry admitted that she had
not talked to Ed about the
idea.

Complaints

Shelley recalled that com*
plaints about the various mus-
ical groups chosen to appear
on campus “are nothing new,
and this is net personally dir-
ected at Ed." Karen Auers
bach, James Hall President,
made perhaps the most perils
nent comment of the discus-
sion when she said that “I‘ve
had complaints from peoplein
my ball, but there is nothing
I can do about it. Having the
students elect the Social Coor-
dinator would get it off the
SGA's backl"

The Presidents generally as
greed that, if nothing else, the
election would at least be a
way of gauging student opinion
on the types of groups which
should be selected. Shelley
made it clear that no action
was to be taken on the issue,
and that the discussion was
just for the purpose of throw-
ing the idea around.

The only action taken during
the evening was thepassage of
a Joint Board recommendation
that students be given full
voting power on the Divisional
EPC’s. As matters standnow,
the student representatives
elected by the majors in each
department do not have full
voting power, since only two
students may vote on any given
resolution. All faculty meme
bers may vote. A resolution
passed by a Divisional EPC
must then be approved by the
Division (which consists en-
tirely of faculty members)
before it can go on to the all‘
college End

With little discussion the
resolution was passed 13'!,
and Shelley encouraged the
house presidents to work in
their own dorms to build up
student support for the idea.

Pinball

Greg Sayre of the Student
Services Committee reported
that the profits from the For»
um pinball machines now to
tal $700. “Isn’t that amaz-
ing?" This money is now at
the disposal ofthe Committee,
which is presently examining
the possibility of extending
night hours of the Forum on
weekends.

A subcommittee is being ape
pointed to study the various
issues concerning SAGA.
Sayre noted that the Commit-
tee is now trying to locate
copies of the SAGA contract
for examination.

There will be no South Lou-
nge meeting of the Board next
Monday, since the housepres-
idents are holding a mrefully
planned informal meetingwith
the RA’s at Grinnell House.

Enrollnténl On
The Rise Here

Figures obtained from the
Registrar's Office indicate
that the number of students on
Grinnell campus is slightly
above first semester last
year. 1,287 students are ens
rolled in fullstime academic
programs, 1,251 on campus
and 36 in off-campus pro
grams. This is comparable
to a total of 1,244 in Fall
1970.

The number of Freshmen
has decreased from 410 in
1970 to 373 this semester.
The ratio between men and
women in the Freshman class
is nearly one to one with a
single additional woman. The
same balance is shown in new
transfer students, 19 new wo~
men and 19 men.

The number of sophomores
and seniors increase by about
twenty and thirty respectively.
Juniors on campus decreased,
evidence of the popularity of
ACM programs.

The slight growth was pre-
meditated by the College.
