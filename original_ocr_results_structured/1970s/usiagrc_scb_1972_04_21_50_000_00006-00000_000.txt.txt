On Solidarity

As students once again trudged into Herrick Chapel this week for
mass meetings and once again an allecampus opinion poll was taken
concerning student strike action, it somehow reminds us all who
were here two years ago of another day, another time when that
aura of activism swept through the lethargy and set us all afire.

Whether that fire now burns quite so high is yet to be seen. Yet
no doubt an apathy, a numbness to what is going on in the outside
world, has once again been temporarily removed. But the present
poli cal consciousness has spurned activism with a difference; it
generally seems more rational, more thinking, more concerned
about effect rather than symbolism.

At last Monday's Herrick meeting the same old signs of “70 were
there: the radical rhetoric, concern with action, the unwillingness
of the majority to listen to another vieWpoint, But since then the
attitude has changed. The laughs and jeers are gone, and when a
student rose to talk softly about what the townspeople might think,
as a student did last Wednesday night, she got a round of applause
instead.

Substantial numbers of students are willing to vote in an opinion
poll and take a stand that only eight could take in 1970' not to
strike, or not to extend such a strike. We must always be on guard
against letting the emotional enthusiasm of our convictions trample
those who see a different view, and fortunately that trampling is
not taking place, this time around

With the more evenly divided opinion, however, or perhaps we
should say the inability of the majority to dictate, we come up
with another problem: what do we do to act? Is it symbolism which
will get us what we want? Or is it really directional, concrete
action? And what is it, anyway, that we want to accomplish? Is it
to make others aware of the war we deplore? Or is it to lntensifyl
our own convictions?

Those questions have been asked and answered in many different
ways during the past few days. But in the end, it comes to this:
we have chosen to allow ourselves to be free agents this time, and
so our actions must undoubtedly be indiVidual as well.

This choice, however, becomes the crux of the problem, For if
we choose to allow individual freedom and differences of opinion,
how can we present to the world outside the student solidarity which
so many seek? The answer is elusive precisely because it does not
exist. Solidarity is a false concern. In effect, by choosing to act
individually we destroy that elusive solidarity by definition, Solie
darity in a forum for individual expression can exist only if we all
should happen to agree, or if the forum is destroyed by a domineer—
ing majority. This week has proved that the first simply hasn't
happened, and that we have chosen, fortunately, not to submit to
the second.

This,‘ then, is where we stand in regard to the student strike.
The rationale for a strike is vague, varying from time to time and
from student to student. But the primary fact about a strike is
that, if undertaken by a large majority, it is an action which pre-
sents to outsiders a picture of a united and radical student body,
somehow willing to become martyrs (or vacationers) for an im-
possible cause.

This image, if presented, would be false. By failing to continue
our usual academic activity we sacrifice nothing worth sacrificing,
we incur costs without giving benefit. And the rationale behind i --
the grasp for solidarity-—is as illogical as the action itself,

We are adult citizens of an educated country which allows a certain
amount of input into its decision—making processes. Given that, is
this strike the best tool we have with which to make ourselves felt?

This action is neither symbolic nor constructive. It changes no
minds, convinces no doubters, and solidifies no beliefs. We can
carry on our demonstrations and silent marches without taking
time away from the classroom to do so,

The frustration we feel can be solved only by our obtaining an
input into the system which decides to continue this terrible war.
That problem, certainly, is a formidable obstacle with which we
should continue to struggle. Something, indeed, must be done.
But whatever it is that we must do, walking out of the classroom
is not the answer

Homosexual
Communication

Called For

To the Editors:

I have been reading Sartre on the
Saint, Genet, and because I ”think
about what I’m reading makes me
think about” I have a few things
to communicate to people about
homosexuality. The Studs who twit-
ter over Jokes of-color would do
better to Come to honest terms with
their own femininity and stop trans-
ferring their Own problems in hand-
ling this legitimate part of them-
selves on others.‘ Furthermore,
homosexuality in men does not imply
an unnatural porportion of this femi-
nine commodity as far as I know.

i should have said unusual propor-
tion since the distinction between
natural and unnatural is an impossi-
ble and hence unwarranted one to
make. Everything under the sun is
natural. It you don't believe it, read
Crab Canon.

1) 5. Since this is probably the only
letter I’ll ever write in, lthink it’s
real dumb that so many spoiled
people should feel so sorry for them-
selves that they steal from other
people. i know we’ve all got a load on
our minds but We should be ready by
now to bear responsibility for our
own actions, in thislrespect at least.

Fears Strike Impact In lown

To the Editors:

i feel that the students of Grinnell
College are making a terrible mis-
take in involving townspeople in
whatever antirwar activities we may
have Townspeople are aware of the
steppedrup activity in Vietnam and
are aware that a useless war has
been raging these past SIX years
They have| lost soils in this war just
as we have lost our brothers

But few oi them Want to be told by
College Students what [0 do or how to
react Most oItheSe adults know What
they are doing and want to act in their
own way and feel that Grinnell Col»
lege students should leave them
alone ll Gl‘ilmell College wishes to
list or lype letters to congressmen
or undertake any other actions, that
is fine. “But don’t try to Stir me up

What i am trying to say is that we
should leave the people in town
alone. Two years ago Grinnell Cole
lege tried to make them aware otthe
problems and only,created bitter-
ness and distrust. I am involved with
people in town a great deal and feel
the tension towards college students
even though I am straightrlooking.

Two years is a very short time to
them, Whereas at our age we under~
go many changes in our lives and
often forget (or try to until our mem<
ories are refreshed) The people
in town would react against actions
we might take to involve them and
what little rapport we have built up
in the last two years would crumble,
especially it we try to involve their
young people. ‘

If anyone is really listening to what
i am saying, 1 would plead with you
to handle this whole situation with
kid gloves. if we do something con-
structive, involving bnly the campus,
we may gain much ‘more than if we
do such negative actions as strikes.
This very word has nasty connota»
lions to the people in town and only
proves to them that college students
are as immature is they thought.

I am not saying any of this because
i am against antirwar action on this
campus, but i have talked with many
people in town and know their sentir
lnents right now, i hope that Grinnell
College considers all of this before
they act. .
