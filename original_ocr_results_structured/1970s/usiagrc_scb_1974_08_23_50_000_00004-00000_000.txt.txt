Grinnell College athletics.’ The
Pioneers had no first Or second
team placings in conference meets
all year. The last Grinnell con-
ference champ was the surprising
golf coup in May 1973.

Indicative oi the mediocrity of
Grinnell’s performance last year
are the All Sports Standings of the
Midwest Athletic Conierence,
released by the MAC over the
summer, The Standings, a com-
pilation of achievement in
baseball, basketball, cross
country. football. golf, soccer,
swimming, tennis, track, and
wrestling, put Grinnell in the MAC

Pride and Enthusiasm

Mitchell expects to “develop
pride and make Grinnell iootball
and basketball a tradition7
something to look forward to each
year. We’ll get rid of the myths
that Grinnell is the doormat ol the
conference. We Will try to make it
more exciting,"

But how does one accomplish
this?

“More peer relationships. Let’s
carry our commitment through.
Let’s leave the mediocrity at
home."

Crime Tech

Mitchell, or “Mitch," has
glowing credentials dating all the
way back to high high school years
at Crane Tech in Chicago There he
lettered ’in football, basketball,
baseball. and track. As a senior he
was captain at both the football and
basketball squads.

Moving on to Kentucky State
University, he did it all over again.
As a freshman he lettered four
times, including participation in
hurdling, discuss throwing, and
shot putting

Kentucky State

After his senior year, and he
captained the football team that
year, he did some time in the ar-
my. Returning to Kentucky State,
he hecamc Head Freshman Coach
in football. and later assistant
varsity coach. It was at this point
that he coached a young man
named Maurice ”Mo” Hunt, later
drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs,
and currently track, wrestling, and
assistant football coach at Grinnell
College.

BU grabbed Mitchell in 1968,
where he had varying positions in
football and basketball, and leaves
there after a fine record as Head
Basketball Coach.

Competitive Conlerence

Mitchell realizes the “very
competitive nature of the Midwest
Athletic Conference, but remains
“Very optimistic,” He has talked
and worked out with several
players—Jim Casey, Paul
Delaney, and Hosea Engram
among themiand has been im»
pressed by their enthusiasm.
“These guys are hungry, and with
hungry players you’re one step
ahead."

Grinnellians have something to
look forward to this year in sports.
With three new Coaches this year—
feature stories will be upcomingv
the tide may well be turning back
alter last year’s disastrous
campaigns. Let's hope so.
