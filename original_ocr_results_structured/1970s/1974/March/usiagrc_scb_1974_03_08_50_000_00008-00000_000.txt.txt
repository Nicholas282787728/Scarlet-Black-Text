there till the time you leave is ex-
cellent," he said.

It a doctor or gynecologist is not
feasible in the Health Center, the
space could perhaps be used by
the S'exAEd Committee for sexual-
ity counselling, The committe’spure
pose is to make available informae
tion concerning birth control and
VD at the beginning of each Semes-
ter by distributing handbooks and
to plan and make available pro—
grams dealing with various aspects
of human sexuality, according to
HaasJThey developedagame “gear
ed to allowing individuals to engage
in conversations about sexuality,”
said Ruyitelaere.

She continued, “I feel that we are
one or the most active groups on
campus in trying to disseminate
material on sexuauty, The main
, reason we’ve not been more active
is that our focus is not so much
on the mechanics of sexuality but
on the dynamics of relationships
and sexual decision making,”

Closer Connection ‘

Both Haastand Ruyitelaere are for
moving sexuality counselling into the
Health Center. HAnything that will
make closer connections between
the Health Center and our program
i would support entirely.” Haas
noted. ”The Health Center up to
this oint has not been very res-
ponsive in the particular area. This
' is not a blast at the Health Center,
but a blast at the entire setrup,
When you don't have a doctor tied
in, you can't get programs insti—
tuted." He said that sexcounsellors
in the past have round rooms in the
P E complex to meet with people.

Sexuality counsellors are a subs
group of the committee. Haas, Ruye
itelaere, Pain Charney, Margie Baur
mguarten, and Katy Puckett are
working on training the counsel-
ors. “We're hoping that once this
group is iormed there will remain
a core group who will continue it,"
remarked Ruyftelaere. She sees the
biggest problem at setting up sex-
uality counselling in theHealthCen-
ter as being the irregular hours
that the student counselors would
keep. ,

in additional problem she said is
“a ieeiing that the Health center
is not a place where you can go
with questions'about sex, birth con-
trol, or' just general gynecological

questions. It's not very healthy to
have that feeling, People tend to go
it they have a cold, but may not
it they have a yeast intection. This
is not the image they, (the Health
Center start); try to portray but it
is the image that's there. We should
really try to change it,”

Movmg sexuality counselling there
would perhaps change that image
she said. i
‘Davis said that she tools it is a
good idea to move insexuality coun-.
seuing. She herself has had six
years‘ or psychiatric training and is
interested in birth control counsel-
ing. She offered her services in
counseling if needed. ”I think it
would help link the Health Center
with the rest oi the college,” she
said about the idea. Durr also said
she wouldn’t mind helping out,

Hall said she thought it would be
“fine” it it is “well-organized and
well-run ” “It can’t be haphazard
with people not showing up Whatever
help is needed, i would make avails
able, but i don’t want to take over
the responsibility.” She suggested
using the isolation room which is
an excess room. This room is “not
ideal tor patients as far as traiiic,
telephones, etc., but it the door is
closed and heavier drapes are put
up and with a one to one conversa-
tion, this type or counseling could
be accomodated." She added, “I
really would be quite happy to see
the building put to more use.”

No Privacy

Pickard said that she felt it was
“a poor idea" to move in sex ed
counseling because the “physical
structure would not allow tor it.”

She says there needs to be a room
separate lrom the others and that
there is not privacy, even in the
isolation room. “You can hear any
thing even with the door closed. The

physical structure does not warrant.

could be used, Pickard added.
Zwerling said, “There must be a
more conducive atmosphere some
place else on campuski‘here’ssomv
ething about the sterile atmosphere
at the Health Center that’s ]uSt not
conducive to talking about one of
those old taboo subiects.”

Along with the student suggestions
about what the Health Center needs,
many students complain aboutHealth
Center personell attitudes and one
ice policy. The staff’s general rese
ponse to these student complaints
is that the Health Center cannot do
everything, Ferguson Said he feels
the Health Center is “doing a good
job.” “The nurses need backing
trom a doctor. They can’t treat
someone without having a doctor

He also said that the nurses must
make referrals because they can’t
prescribe antibiotics and “can only

make the most simple diagnoses.v

else makes the decision for the
student." Hall added, “We Can't
take care or everything and what
we can't take Care of we have
to send to doctors. Nurses do not
diagnose or prescribe,” she ems
phasized "The profession is what
limits us.”
Visiting, oriice Hours

Visiting and cities hours have al—
ways been a sore point ibetween
nurses and students and according
to Hall, “it probably will always
be a cause tor complaint.” She
Justified the visiting hour policy
by saying that people come to the
Health Center “for peace and quiet
and how can they do that if there
are unlimited Visiting hours.”
“You‘d be surprised over the numr
ber of Students who don’t want vi—
sitors, It’s the person who comes
visiting who has the temper tan-
trums,”

She continued, “The Health Cen-

ter is the only place that still has
rules and regulations. it’s not the

library or the forum, We're deal-
ing with people and their health
and their health is their life. If
we would practice haphazard pro-
cedures and medications, the stue

Davis said that when people are
really sick they Come to the center
for rest and “having to see a lot
of people is a tiring thing It's
hard to say no.” She said she
feels that limited visiting hours is
“not too bad,” She also said she
feels that if a Student cannot come
to visit during the established vie
siting hours, she might let him or
her visit 10 or 15 minutes outside
Visiting hours depending on the Site
uatinn.

Cameron remarked, “I could see
how visiting hours should be ﬂex-
ible but in the end the discretion
would have to he left up to thenurse

“Visiting rules must be changed,

has to be two visitors at a time
to reduce the chance of contagion
and in consideration of other pate
ients there If there are three or
tour iriends visiting, it gets kind
of noisy, and sound carries."

Hall said she can’t understand why
Students won’t come to the Health
Center when they are sick. “I just
don’t know, I've looked at it and
discussed it with others from all
angles Is the student healthier than
he or she was before?” She con-
tinued, ”I wish there was some
means by which students could be-
come more knowledgeable about
what we offer and about our staff.
Ignorance causesalotoiprublems.”

Davis added, “Each of us has

that there has been ”a lormality

about the place.” “The center used
to be really busy. The nurses didn’t
have time to lust sit around and
talk. They weren't concerned with
students concerns too much. But.
now, we’re not as busy and we’re
paying more attention to what stu—
dents say they want, We’re trying
to change our image."

oita Modak, a three year student
aid, stated, “People don’t know the
nurses and don’t go to them, even
for medical Sorts of things. For
some unknown reason, people don’t

continued, “The Health Center is
not being used. Obsiously there’s
something wrong. People don’t rea-
tlize that 3/4 of the nursing Staff
has changed this year -» in some
ways that’s changed the HealthCen—
ter ”

Pickard remarked that “people
don’t take the time to,abandon any
rumors they hear about the Health
Center and don’t come in to dispel
these rumors. There are people
who feel they are treated fairly at
the Health Center. No one is iorced
to stay. it’s voluntary admission
unless under doctor’s orders.”

“People come to the Health Cen-
ter expecting a miracle Cure. The
Health Center is not God -- it can
only give remedies to cure certain
symptoms. People will sutier two
or three weeks with a cold and then
come in. Part of the problem lies
with the lack of responsmility on
the student's part, They expect too
much and come too late,” Modak
also commented on students’ critie
much and come too late," saidPiCk-
ard. Modak also commented on stu-
dents’ criticism of the Health Cen-
ter. “It’s fine to say that something
is wrong, but it's the way you go
about saying it. Studentsaren’ttact»
ful when they criticize the Health
Center. The staff (and myselt) are
touchy about complaints when peo-
ple won’t give reasons."

Zwerling added that the students
themselves have to take a greater
part in making the Health Center
effective. “We getassininecallslike
the time one Studentcalledsayinghe
knew he was going to get sick be-
cause everyone else nnhisﬂoorwas
and he asked it a chocolate malt
would make any difference. What
can you do about people like that?"

Pickard statedthatthenursing staff
has changed. “The new nurses are
younger and, also, know their stuff.
Shirley has a young attitudetowards
life and Karen and Marie have a
better understanding of the students
because they’re closer to the age
of the students. Mrs. Hall treats
me like a daughter. 1 never have
any problems with any of the
nurses .

Cameron stated that she thinks
something should be done since the
students aren'tusing rheHealth Cen>
ter. ”It could be because they don’t
know what it can offer. You always
hear those stories about how bad
it is so you don’t go. Maybe it’s
a ‘Health Center syndrome’likethat
at other colleges, You know how
people always have to complain
about something."

She continued, ”There is a Cer—
tain atmosphere, but it just has to
be that way. It someone came out
in dungarees and street clothes to
give you an allergy shot, now, you
know that just wouldn’t come off
right. The Health Center just can’t
do some things. The studentsshould
get togetherand saywhatthey want.”
Pickard concluded, “We need Sums
marized Statements on the kinds of
treatments that the Health Center
has to offer so that students are
made aware of the services pro-
vided. Once every student has been
notified, it’s the student’s responsi-
bility to come to the Health Center
immediately when he or she feels
ill re not two days or two weeks
later. it's notall the students’ fault
and not all the Health Center's fault.
It’s a combination. There must be
a way to bring the two together."
“I know that changes will have
to be made and they will be made
in good time,”concludedHall. “We-
've already made a lot oi changes;
changes in office hourstorstudents,
for example. Certain things are not
difficult and if it makes the stur
dents nappy. i'm all ior it,"
