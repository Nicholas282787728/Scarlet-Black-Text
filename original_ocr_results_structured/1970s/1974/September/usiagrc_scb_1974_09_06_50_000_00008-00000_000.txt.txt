Soccer: Pfifsch takes over

by Dave Cnlrcrt

It's a new day in Grinnell College
socceriat least all signs seem to
point in that direction. Rebounding
from a miserable 2-5-1 1973 cam-
paign, the squad has come up with
an entire new coaching staff, is
returning lettermen, several
ilashy new players, and a whole
new team spirit. with over 30
players out, Head Coach John
Pfitsch is hard pressed just
keeping everybody involved.

Pfitsch, also Athletic Director of
Grinnell College, has been the big
surprise thus iar. Since admitting
on the first day oi practice~
already a lull two weeks ago~ihat
he didn’t know the “first thing”
about soccer, he has done an ex-
ceptional job oi orienting himseli
to the sport.

“I'm very excited to be coaching
soccer,” he told the 5&3. “It‘s like
a new career, The similarities
between soccer and basketball are
very obvious and I'm coniident i
can pick it up.”

Pfltsch, who has coached nine
sports at the college level, at
Grinnell, Midland, and University
of Kansas, coached Grinnell
basketball for 25 years.

Meek adds diversity to PE

by Dave Calvert

With the new tolerance of
women’s athletics that has swept
into the Grinnell Physical
Education picture, the College has
iinally seen fit to add a woman to
the coaching staff, Donna Meck,
officially Lecturer in Physical
Education, will work this year with
varsity volleyball and basketball,
PE. gymnastics, and the talk
dance program. She joins Ron
Mitchell and John Martinek as new
Grinnell Coaches this year.

ion-a Wesleyan

Meck has been in Grinnell since
1971 as a teacher in the local junior
high school, but her roots extend
back to another small town,
rairiield, la. At lowa Wesleyan, a
small, in-state, Methodist college,
she was tremendously active in
women's sports. Besides playing
varsity (intercollegiate) field
hockey, volleyball. and softball,
she served as manager and trainer
ior [he nationally ranked womens
basketball team at lowa Wesleyan.

AI lW Meck got her first cx-
posurc to gymnastics, in which she
soon became ”very involved Each
year," she recalls, “we would put
on a gymnastics show ior the
campus” Also, at [W she took
several oiiiciating and coaching
courses.

Since moving on to Grinnell for
the junior high school ap-

pointment, Meck has continued to‘

ieed her appetite for sports. Aiter
helping organize basketball at the
J.H,S,, Meck took her team to an
undefeated season last year.

She has kept up with her gym-
nastics also, attending a gym.
nastics clinic at the University of
California, “here she worked on
vaulting and the uneven bars. In
addition, Mac:- told the 5&8. “I
think I’ve been to every gyms
nastics clinic that’s been held in
Iowa.”

Varsity Volleyball

Despite the presence of only iour
upperclassmen, the volleyball
squad seems deep in talent. Fully
lz ireshmen are out [or the team,
“a really good number," Ap-
parently many oi last year's
veterans are now out for field
hockey, “the football of women’s
Sports.”

Although Mcck is quick to admit
that many oi her players are
inexperienced, and some oi them
still.working on basics, She sees
several good signs already, Most

impressive are some of the sore
Vers, says Meek, “including a few
roundhouse, or powerhouse ser-
ves."

The tour returning players are
Sue Beise, Anna Fong, Betsy
Scheuerman, and Abbi Swanson.
Rounding out the roster are Beth
Barnet, Robin Connelly, Brenda
Douglas, Susan Feuerstein, Eva
l-lierschbiel, Lisa Hopp, Mary Ann
McBride, Julie Meyer, Amanda
Newsteller, Jennifer Paarlborg,
Hilary Rago, and Sheryl Walters.

Opening day for the women is the
iast approaching 14th of Sep-
tember, at William Penn. The
home opener will be delayed until
Sept. 28, in the Island Gym, versus
Mt. Mercy,

Gymnastics 7

Although [here will be no in-
tercollegiate gymnastics this
season, even that may come to
pass next year. Thirty women have
shown up for the PE activity
class. “including live girls who've
been doing it ior three years with
me in the junior high school.”

With so many young ladies
participating in the program,
Meck is lamenting the m-
completeness oi the PEG equip-
ment. Speciiically, Meck has been
promised a new trampoline for
next year—we’ll have to wait and
see ll it actually comes around,

Other equipment which is
available includes a balance beam,
one set of unevens, and mats,

Biggest Enrollment

This year 's enrollment surpasses
anything it’s ever been at Grinnell,
according to Meek. and she’s
understandably pleased with the
amount of interest shown. She
hastens to point out that this is all
Women, and in a semester when
there are already more women
involved in athletics than ever
before.

As far as gymnastics ior men, it
is a ailable through the course
being instructed by Ron Mitchell of
the PE, Staff, Meck has never
worked with men in gymnastics,
and acknowledges that she is not
familiar with the mechanical and
leverage differences inherent in
men.

And Folk Dancing

Donna Meck is also coordinator
of the Gi'innell College folk dancing
program, something she is looking
iorward to very much. In one
ticipation, this summer she studied
folk dance at the'University of the
Paciiic‘. ’ '

Folk dancing has been given a
push by the College this year in the
torm oi, believe it or not, increased
financial support. Meck will work
with a budget of $1500, most of
which will probably go into
costumes and staging of dances.

One final service Meck plans to
provide is that or assistant
basketball coach, under head
coach Sandra Hoth.

“Trial alid Error"

Unfortunately ior Meck, her
future at Grinnoll is not assured.
Her contract with the school leaves
her position largely one of “trial
and error," with the Outside
possibility of the old “here today,
gone tomorrow,"

Meck, however, is confident in
her ability to succeed at Grinnell.
She already has “a favorable
impression of the teams" she's
working with, as well as of the new
emphasis on women's sports hcrc.
Says Meck, “I’m really excited by
the fact that thci'c isn't lust olic
coach for the entire women’s
athletic program here Women
now may chose among some seven
or eight sports."

Netwomen set to go

by Elaine Carey

Women’s tennis is in a new
racket this year, playing their
season in the fall instead of the
spring with several new
racketeers.

Grinnall has joined other
regional schools in reversing the
women's tennis calendar from
spring to tail competition. Even the
state tournament has been set for
autumn, according to Ms. Anna
Wack, women‘s tennis coach. More
available practice space was cited
as the major factor initiating the
calendar switch, Wack explained,

New players number a while the
veterans also add up to 6. Practice
began with the iirst day oi classes
and the women “have done real
well and are really working hard
with no sloughing off," Ms. Wack
commented. Rallying most oi last
week to work off the summer rust,
the women have put their practice
hours this week to work on specific
parts of the game, especially the
service and the overhead. Services
were videotaped Monday,
providing useiul hints to the team
on Service form.

, Positions remain undetermined

“Spirited Corps"

Conner, aiter a week or
pessimism, has raised his hopes
ior this year’s soccer Pioneers. “I
think we have a heck oi a squad, a
spirited corps, and it's just starting
to blend into something good."

Possert, an Austrian student

Aiding the new coach are two
”soccer experts," Al Conner and
Willi Possert. Conner is a veteran
soccer coach, having led a squad
on the high school level in Penn-
sylvania ior ten years. Now a
Grinneil resident employed by
Stadiums Unlimited, Conner is
here to provide “technical ads

been such a lack of believability as

that little old strikebreaker, Calvin
Coolodge, think if he knew that
members of America's favorite
past time (violence) could go on
strike just like firemen, and your
local Teamster's union? Of course
all of what i am saying is to
assume that football is in the public
interest.

It is in the public interest if you
consider that corporation
executives use the ownership of
franchises as tax write;ol'fs. So far
as these gentlemen (with a law
exceptions) are concerned what is
at issue here is more than the
satisfaction of the fails, it is a
matter at money. Sports is no
longer a game in this country, it is
big business and it is these sports
moguls who are ripping the fan oil
with exol‘bitent ticket prices while
they continue to write off millions
on the tax returns.
