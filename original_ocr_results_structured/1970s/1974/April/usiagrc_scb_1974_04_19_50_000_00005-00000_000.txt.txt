Attention Collectors, Part II

 

by Bruce Green

Last week I started discussing
the Prestige Twofe rs that have been
released in the last few months.
This week l would like to continue
that discussion, with some more
records.

AS I did last week, this Weekl
am going to start off with Miles
Davis, this time talking about Mi—
les Davis (Prestige 24001), and the
two numbers, “Airegin,” and "Ol-
eo,” both by Sonny Rollins. They
are both excellent early Miles, with
Coltrane, Red Garland, Paul Cham»
bers, and Philly Joe Jones.

”Oleo" is a fast classic, and one
of the most famous of Rollins’com—
positions, recorded by Miles in the
fifties. “Airegin” is just as good,
and just as well performed by What
is commonly called “the quintet”
of Modern Jazz. Personally, lfind
Miles with this group better than
any other Miles lhave ever heard,
with the exception of the iamous
"Porgy and Bess, " which was done
with Gil Evans.

Theolonius Monk is represented
by Theolonius Monk (Prestige
24006). Personally, I can’t think
of a more apt title. This package
includes, along with Monk, such lu-
minaries as Art Blakey, and Per-
cy Heath. The two numbers on my
package are ”Work” and “Reflec-
tions," both by Monk. They areper—
formed superbly, and, especially
with “Work.” who says Monk can-
not play technically greatpiano? His
technique on that tune is some ofthe
best I have ever heard. This al—
bum is great.

Eric Dolphy, the late sax and cla-
rinet man, has his own twofer, (Pr»
estige 24008), and two tunes are
represented here. “Eclipse" is a
tonal experiment with cello, bass,
drums, and clarinet, so harmonic—
ally advanced I find it painful. But"
“LES" is, on the other hand, a
simple fast piece with Dolphy on
alto and the great Freddie Hubbard
on trumpet. This is an excellent
piece, and worth listening too,

Mingus, the great Mingus, is re-
presented by his "Work Song,"
which bears only a slight resemb»
lance to the more famous “Work

 

'Weil: Supports Student
Rights Documents

To the Editors:

Last week, the Social Poli 'es and
Regulations Cornniuee distributed
its proposal for institutionalizing
students‘ rights within the Grinnell
College community. and moilnods of
recourse to which students can re.
sort when they feel that their rights
have been violated.

Very briefly, the document divides
siullents’ rights into the following
areas: rights concerning the use of
rcsid.. cc hall roo , the right to
privacy; responSlblllties of mm.
bership at Grinnell and the rcla.
tionship between the Violation of
campus policies andcivillaw; rights
with regard to student records; and
students’ rights within the class.
room. 3 the proposal passes, it
will be one or the most important
pieces or Crinnoll legislation to
arrcci students.

Up until now, Grinnellians have had
a hard time trying to ﬁnd out what
their rights really are, especially
with respect to academics (including
grading policies), and what they

gus lays down some fine bass work,
Which is hardly surprising, since
I think he is the best bass man
working today. Mal Waldron on pi-
ano, Eddie Bert on Trombone, Wil-
lie Jones on Drums, and George
Barrow on tenor sax, complete the
lineup. The number is excellent,
and, probably, so is the album,
Charles Mingus, (Prestige 24010),
which it seems to date from the
jazz workshop period.

today, and his records irom that
period are no worse. He is repre-
sented by "Mambo Bounce” and“St
Thomas," both by him and one of
them a classic. He is accompanied
by such men as Art Blakey, Percy
Heath, Max Roach, and others.They
both are great.

The Modern Jazz Quartet, com—
posed of John Lewis, Milt Jackson,
Percy Heath and Connie Kay, has
their own Twofer, (Prestige 24005),

April" on it, among others. They
don't really need much in the way
of review. They are great.

Record companies, however, don't
always come up with good material.

could do about infringements upon
their rights. One of the minor pro-
visions of the proposal, for ex-
amp‘e, permit-i a strident to appeal
a grade, under certain conditions,
to the All-College EPC, which is
the only all-college academic body
which includes students as well as
faculty. The need to have these
rights enumerated was consider.

previously been an appalling lack in
the organization of Grinnell.

Please voice your support of the
proposal to the administration and
faculty, who ultimately will have to
approve the Declaration if it is to
become a permanent part of Grin-
“ell.

in Carlifornia Zuckermnn attended.
He will be assisted by Scott Mason
on bass, Michael Stern on tabla,
and Elliott Lewis on piano.

This is evidenced by the recent
Charlie Parker record twofer(Pre-
stige 24009). The recording itself
is grainy, hard to listen to and bad—
ly recorded. But the prime problem
with it is that there are uncomplete
tunes, just the ensembles and Far-
ker solosJindthese Were made when
Parker had sidemen of the caliber
of Miles Davis, Red Rodney, Max
Roach, and others. The Parker re-
cordings were probably engineered
by a man named Dean Benedetti,
who made his career out of follow-
ing Bird around and recording solos.
This, according to Ross Russell's
recent bio on Bird, “Bird Lives."
Bird's solos are interesting, but
the record isn’t worth buying.

Coltrane, represented by “Traile-
ing In" is an excellent sax player
even in the days of these record-
ingS. This dates from when 'Tral-le
was with Miles Davis, and is ac-
companied on both "Traneing in"
and “Russian Lullaby" by RedGar—
land, Paul Chambers, and Arthur
Taylor. Excellent tracks, probably
excellent album, John Coltrane,
(Prestige 24003).

Mose Allison, if you like him, is
ill great form on his album, (Pres-
tige 24002) with an instrumental,
“New Ground," and a silly but
great vocal, “Parchmant Farm."
Good Mose, even great Mose,

Yusef Lateef, the real sax and fl-
ute man, has his own twoier, (Prr
estige 24007) where he does good
things like an African type vocal
and instrumental number, “Maha—
ba,” and a good jazz number, “Sea
Breeze." He is one of the greatest
jazz ilutists, and this album has
some prime examples. Good but not
classic. _

All in all, the Prestige 24000 ser-
ies is a boon for serious collec-
tors like me, and some of them are
interesting for others, I am not
saying that every album they have
is worth buying, but most are col-
lector's items that may never be
available in any other source. So,
if you Want to hear Miles in the
fifties, or Rollins, or 'Trane,lthe
albums are worth your while.

Cantor: Gun laws Unenlorced

To the Editors:

This is in response to the April
12 column by Dave Schechter, hea-
ded Whose Right to Bear Arms.

1 am against the use of guns.
But I am more strongly opposed
to the idea of outlawing them. In
several ways, legislation banning
guns would create new problems
and would solve none. ‘

If there is one thing waldo not
need, it is another unenforceable
‘law. Because marijuana is illegal,
our law enforcement agencies sp-
end millions of our dollars each
year attempting to keep it from us.
And still pot is probably as com-
mon in the American home as are
guns. _Were guns outlawed, huge
smugglulg operations would be hap-
py to provide the weapons and the
market would be grand. Why help
organized crime?

The more laws a state designs,
the more criminals it creates. Just
as anti»grass laws make criminals
of ordinary citizens who simply ch-
oose to have fun in a certain way,
a banning of firearms would brand
a man who feels that in keeping a
Weapon he is helping to protect
his family. We might consider this
man wrong, but surely he is no cr-

iminal.

In trying to discount the argument
that “if guns were outlawed, then
only outlaws would have guns,” D
ve ignores the fact that by deﬂni
9.0!: were firearms outlawe , an
body possessing a gun, for any rea-
son, would be an outlaw. .

Our country will be rid oi guns
only when the people who want
them stop wanting them. Laws ne-
ver keep items from the hands of
those who Want thembadly.Thiswas
seen in the prohibition of liquor
and is currently e ’ need in the
prohhlition of marijuana, heroin,
and many other drugs, as well as
switchblade knives.

Any attempt at enforcing an anti-
gun law would be an undertaking
wasteful in manpower and in tax
money, Firearms will either dis-
appear after much timE, because
people will no longer feel the need

- or desire for them, or they will

exist always. But to pass legisla-
tion aimed at outlawing guns is
foolishness that amounts to.wasting
money; making the underworld all
offer it would never refuse; making
criminals out of ordinarily peaceful
folks; and, in the end, leaving us no
safer than we are now.
