to the night editor at United Press
lnternational’s Chicago bureau, pars
ticipated in workshops, media can
reer discussions, and a panel diSr
cussion on media responsibility.

Donald H. Clark, St. Louis pubs
lisher and Grinnell trustee, served
as honorary chairman ofthe confer»
once, which was attended by more
than 50 radio and newspaper staff»
ers from a dozen Iowa and Illinois
colleges and was hosted by four
Grinnell media organizations.

O’Brien and Jacobson led a radio
workship, discussing their broad-
cast roles and several problems
facing the broadcast industry and
the broadcast reporter.

Jacobson said he joined WEBM-
TV, a CBS affiliateownedbythenet-
work, but was fired two years ago
for being “too controversial.”

“They wanted to soften the news
»- no more heavy political reporte
ing,” he explained. He became
a commentator for rival NBC for
two years, until another WBBM
format change caused CBS to re
hire him last March.

Jacobson explained that a man
irom the news division was put
in charge instead of a salesman.
“He was looking for someone With
a hard news background and a Chi-
cago identity, and he came to me.”
He said the program is still in the
experimental stages. to see it this
more serious approach to the news
“will sell.” .

He said he has been in the broad»
cast media for ten years and he
“really loves it,” although be ad»
mitted a desire to be a newspaper
reporter. His day is spent resea-
rching and writing his own commen-
tary, which he described as a "jun,
ior Jack Anderson type thing." He
decides what to base his comment
upon after reading the current news
stories and checking to see “What
news story I might add some di-
mension to."

O'Brien explained that her basic
responsibility as Colorado State
house reporter is "to look for and
produce good tape that lets my liss
teners feel they’ve been there.”
‘She worked herself into her pre-
sent position after being a music I
format and consumer reporter.

a typical day consists oi repor-
ting from the statehouse, writing
and anchoring a newscast, and re-
searching and writing her own com-
mentary.

She explained that KOA is run by
General Electric, but that“its de-
lightful to work for a corporation
like General Electric because you
get the benefits, yet by being so
small they don’t notice you or bot-
her with you."

Both Jacobson and O'Brien said

that they liked doing commentary
because it gives them the freedom
to report on what they want.

”Commentary enables you to do
things you can't do on a normal
newscast," O'Brien said. She ex-
plained that she has never been
able to cover state budget approp—
riations to her satisfaction until
she did a week-long series of come
mentaries on the subject.

“Commentary is two minutes of
pure gold. You can work out your
frustrations »- explain things more
in depth. But you're not supposed
to urge action -- because then it
becomes an editorial.”

Both touched on problems in to,
day’s broadcast world, including
FCC regulations and “Happy Talk"
news presentations, humorous news
packages which are currently ap»
pearing on many stations.

Jacobson said he thinks today’s
reporters “are pretty free." “I
don’t think we’re very much has-
sled, but the longer In in the bus—
iness, the more I realize whatl
don't know; the more care-full am.
More and more, I realize that th—
ere are two sides to every issue.”

O'Brien said that she is careful
because even in the area of “or-
dering" a newscast, deciding upon
the order in which stories will be
presented, “a moral judgement is
made. You must know your own
bias and compensate for it.”

Participants in the conferencealso
discussed individual problems at
their own radio stations. ranging
lrom record theft to developing
better newsrgathering systems.

Johnson and Pledge discussed the
role of campus newspapers in their
special kind of community, and the
value of campus journalism exper-
ience for students planning journal-
ism careers.

Johnson admitted that he is and
has been an advocacy journalist. He
said it was his concern with major
social issues that caused himtD quit
as an instructor in political science
at Grinnell to work for the Des
Moines Register.

He complained about the amount
of ”news” that is not really news,
that fills the daily newspaper list—
ing political figures and their pro-
nouncements as a primary attend-
or.

”Almost any good reporter will
thank God for an Eagle Grove (the
explosion and fire last February
in the town of Eagle Grove, lA
that killed thirteen persons) or a
devastating tornado because atleast
its honest news and we can cover it
without being ashamed.”

Pledge described her work as a
wire service reporter and editor
for UPI in Chicago. Wire service
employment, she said, provides a
tremendous opportunity for thegen-
eralist because so many different
types of stories are covered in a
typical day. "
Discussion then turnedtoproblems
faced by student editors. Johnson
suggested that student newspapers
were not covering enough real news
"that they relied too much on news
releases and shallow interviews,
and did little investigative report-
lng.

Student editors complained that
they were hampered by a lack of
dedicated reporters Several, com-

plained that their reporters could
not write a simple, gramaticalEng-
lish sentence.

Johnson and Pledge both suggested
that, if students better understood
the excitement involved in reporting
for astudentnewspaper,andtheben-
efits that it brought to the indivir
duals, more students would become
campus journalists.

The four medla people and Clark
then combined to discuss media (:3,
reers and to give advice on cars
eers. All of them said that it is
better to go out and get experir
ence than to go to a journalism
graduate school.

Johnson said “Don’t go to sch-
nolas a substitute for experience."
He added that graduate school is
useful as long as it is law school
or medical school and not journ-
alism school. Jacobson said, “The
ere's no urgency in developing pro»
fessional abilities at age 21.11 you
have the time and the academic
interest, go to a grad school. It's
an age of specializationinthejourn-
alism field too."

O’Brien said that in journalism,
you have to “know a Little bit about
everything. It’s like intro courses;
a general knowledge ofeverythihg."
She said that there is a need for
more journalism in thefields of ec»
onomics and environmental scienr
ces.

Pledge noted that “you have tosell
your ability to think and sell your
ability to write." She said that a
suburban paper is an ideal place
to start. Johnson agreed. He ad»
vised students to “look at the job
and not the title.” “It’s far more
interesting to work for a small
newspaper and get to do more th-
ings than in a big paper and get to
copy edit,” he said.

O’Brien advised students to learn

how to do “absolutely everything.”'

She told of a reporter who quit for
a while and took on a construction
job at the Eisenhowertunnel. "When
the tunnel became big news in Den—
ver, he became our No. l journalist
expert on it,” she said. “Anything
you do that can increase your sup-
ply ot general knowledge, do it."

The {our alumni came together
again that night in South Lounge to
discuss media responsibility. Pl-
edge said that one problem with the
media todayinvolvessomemembers
of the profession who have been
accused of having “a fat head or
an empty one.”

"A reporter must keep in mind
that he is asking the questions for
his audience; questions they need
to know and want to know. You
can't be so much into yourself that
you don’t keep yourself open to the
audience you’re working for," she
said.

Johnson brought up four areas of
media irresponsibility. One oithese
is the happy talk format. He des-
cribed happy talk as news enterr
tainment. “T.V. news is either en—
tertaining or it’s visual.Newspeople
sit around and joke about the news.
If it’s not visual and not entertainr
ing, its not news,“ he said.

Jacobson described happy talk as
a “cold hard reality of life." “I
wish we could eliminate it 100%.
The terrible fact is that people
buy it. Documentary programming
and serious news casting is just
not popular.” He continued, “Peo-
ple just don’t want to hear hard
real news. They have enough prob-
lems and they don’t want to hear
more especially from some smart
ass reporter who seems to always
take the other side.”

He added, “I have to bite my ton-
gue to say this but I’m ready to
believe that if I can do my politi-
cal reporting and Curtis (the other
anchorman) can do his, it might
be worth this snowball. II standing
on my head gets the message ac-
ross, then maybe that’s the way to
do it.”

It's amatter of competition, O'Br-
ien said. “Happy talk is overtaking
and passing straight news presen-
tation.”

Another area of media irrespon-
sibility discussed was the press
and its Watergate coverage. “The
press patted itself on the back for
its coverage or Watergate," John-
son said. ”But Where was the
press in 1972 when exposes might
have done something to prevent
it.” He added, “The press has

done too little, too late lts fash-
ionable now to get down onthepres-
ident but Watergate was there be-
fore the 1972 election. Then the
press bowed down to the public and
was afraid to take on the president.
Now everyone has jumped on the
bandwagon. The media was remiss
in 1972 and did not do its job.”

This started things rolling in a
game of verbal volleyball between
members of the panel. Jacobson
responded to Johnson’s statement
by saying that the mediadldnothave
the evidence in 1972 to do it.

“It took time to get together the
specifics. You have to have the
speciiic evidence before you can
run anything,” he said. He added.
“I don’t believe a reporter should
be an advocate. But I want to get
the specifics even if I have to
piddle away at the smaller stories
to get at the big one. I’d rather
be sure that I don’t destroy one
guy whodidn’tneedto bedestroyed."

O’Brien said that she too is dis-
tressed about the way the press has
been acting. “I don’t likewhatjour-
nalists have been doing lately, The-
y’ve been out lifting up rocks and
hoping a scandal will pop out and
and embrace them. We‘re all look-
ing lor minieWatergates.“

Johnson brought up the problem of
the relationshipbetweenpoliticsand
the press. He discussedtheproblem
of press releases and politician’s
statements contrived to “masquer-
ade on page oneasnews.”nlongthis
same line, Johnson discussed the
idea of minority groups using the
media to getmeirviewsonthenews.

This led to a discussion on the
business of public relations and
press releases. Jacobson said that
a newsman has an obligation to
see through all “the political chit
chat.” ll you get a story where the
politician is clearly using the press
to serve his own purposes, play
the story as just that, he said.

O’Brien talked about a legislator

' who would introduce a bill if he

waited to make certain views kns
own. She ran an analysis and dis
covered that he introduced ten bills
in 12 days. seven of which could
not properly be considered in that
session of congress. “People are
catching on,” she said.

Jacobson said that the trouble with
PR is that “it tries to prevent
us from covering those facts that
are distasteful." This led Johnson
to discuss his oWn situation of now
being one of the ones responsible
for sending out these press re-
leases. “It’s a paintulthingtocross
over to the other side,” he said,
He explained that he did it because
a year of experience on the senar
tor’s staff and working for a cam
paign “will be invaluable in my
understandlng of the political pros
cess and my news judgment. The
problem now is that I’m Still acting
as a newsman." He said he tells
Culver not to send out so many
releases because it’s bad for the
senator’s credibility.

“What bothers me most, howevér,
is the disdain that politicians and
government officials have iorwork-
ing journalists. They think we are
absolute fools who will print any-
thing.” He talked about the adver-
sary relationship between govern-
ment and the press. “There’sawall
that will never by broken down be-
tween newsmen and politicians.

I’m always suspicious of the mot-
ives of a press secretary inviting
me out for a beer.”

Johnson said that “the media has
been conned into an accomplice and
that‘s not the proper role for the
media to play. The media has be-
come a tool.” He added that hecon-
sidered a flack (a public relations
person), “the lowest form of human
life.” “I’m having difficulty adjust-
ing to it, I feel Isold out. At least
Culver has a good voting record
and deserves to be senator. i be-
lieve in him but I fight him every
day on the matter of press rea

leases.” ‘
The panel then discussed the idea
of the media as a tool of either the

government or of minority groups.

O'Brien said that the media pan- ‘,

ders to minority groups because

“we want to please them."

Johnson brought up the example
where the members of the Ameri-
can Indian Movement (AIM) called
the Des Moines Register to see
what time the reporters couldcover
their takeover of a building in Des
Moines. The question was raised
on whether cameras and reporters
are creating the news by covering
it.

Jacobson argued that it is,the re-
porter’s job ‘to be there. ’He said
that Welfare Mothers or American
Indians can’t calla newsconference.
They have to plan a demonstration.
He said that if it is nonsense, the
film won’t be shown.

He asked, “which is more cred-
ible anyway? - Ten women demon-
strating against slum conditions or
a reporter doing investigative rep-
orting and digging up a story on
the existing conditions. If I dlsi

t

cussed slum conditions on my comr'

mentary, nine out of ten people
wouldn't believe it, but if ten pear

ple demonstrate, more peoplewould
believe it,”

“Any news is relevant,” said Ple
edge. “There are 52 Sundays in a
year and something may break on
one of them. When that happens,
that story receives priority.” But
until then, the press release is
used. She brought up the example
of Senator William Proxmire (Dr
WI) and his use of press releases.
She said that he sends out ”tons
of releases" especially on Sunday
which he knows is a slow day. But
she said that he realizes that his
releases always take second place
behind any other more legitimate
news, whether his is legitimate or
not,

Pledge stated, “One event tends to
trigger other events," She gave the
Patricia Hearst kidnapping incident
as an example of an event leading
to a rash of similar events. She
added, “If the first hijacking had
not been Covered, would there have
been more? Who knows? We can’t
not cover them. It’s news."

Jacobson said that, all in all, he
thinks the media is doing a good job
“despite of and contrary to the wall
being put up against us." .

Jacobson said that the press has
been working on getting things a—
cross like never hefore.”lt’s atlme
for us to hold our headshigh. We’re
marching down the middle and dis-

closing facts. But it's a difficult,

time. People don’t Want to know the
facts,”
