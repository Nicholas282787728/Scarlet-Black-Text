Nixon ends protest era,
students remain active

The resignation oi President Richard M. Nixon was welcome by the
majority oi Am icans, and particularly by Grinnellians who have up
posed Nixon politics practically irom the start,

With his departure, Nixon removed the last bleeding stain irom
Washington ot the Vietnam war, which was the major impetus oi student
revolt across the nation during the late 60’s. “King Richard”'s departure
has thus ended the era oi almost hatred oi the “establishment" by the
youth or America.

it is now in vogue to note how quiet Grinnellians and other college
students have become in comparison to earlier, more active graduates
who practised candlelight marches and protest demanstratlons, Social
critics are also quick to point out that college students today lack a
burning cause to unite themselves politically and etiectively against
social injustices

some even declare that we students have reverted to the rosy. secure
days oi the 50's when joining the establishment represented the ideal goal
in hie These critics could not be turther irom the truth in Judging the
college students or the 70’s.

What people tail to realize is that we students have been exposed to
student demonstrations against the abuses oi society since junior high
Kent State. the apex ui student solidarity on a national scale, occurred
while We were in high school, Student activism was a Common event, one
which was oitcn coupled with violence,

Things began to happen as today's seniors entered their lreshnian year
oi college Perhaps most importantly, the despised dratt lottery was
voided and replaced by the allsvnlunteer army Vietnam became a
disgusting war in everyone, and not just tor college students The
ultimate iinglueing oi the ovei-eoniident Nixon administration began,
spurred by the original student demonstrations which cast doubt on
Nixon's ability to lead the country,

Congress iorced the closure ot the conilict in Vietnam, approved
stricter anti-pollution laws and permitted a broader interpretation oi
civil and women’s rights We “quiet.“ students have careiully observed
the somewhat slow, but positive progress against social injustices made
by the government and other institutions once considered “hopeless" in
our high school days. Now as college students, we race ditierent national
problems

innation ranks as the undisputed national crisis, closely followed by
energy woes. These problems are not conducive to marches on
Washington or demonstrations, which, however, critics oi today's youth
seem to demand But the issues oi the day are no longer moral but
economic ones which involve the entire nation instead oi just college
students. The earlier, iiery protests have served their iunction as at
tentionrgetters so that basic problems could no longer be ignored. The
next, quiet step is developing a solution

The ioundations oi change have been laid by the students oi the 60's
aiter a vocal and painiul struggle. The students oi the 70's are now quietly
erecting the walls oi the movement which is gaining momentum instead
ot sinking into the ground.
