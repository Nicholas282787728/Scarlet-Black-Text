”SGA is the public Forum For stuv
dent input into the administrative
situation," junior DaveGuittar com»

merited.
Guittar noted the tendency to his

ternalize decisions at Grinnell and ‘

that it allowed decisions to be made
unhindered. “That’s perfectly Fine,
That is even happening out in the
world." Guittar stressed that the
decisions are ”subject to a res—
ponsibility Factor.”

“The SGA president represents the
students at the college but is only
indirectly responsible to them,"
Guitiar remarked. "This indirect-
ness Forces the SGA president to
represent himself and accept dir-
ect responsibility For his actions
In these he presents himselF to the
students and by these the students“
are represented”

The currentiSGA structure Guit-
tar Felt, is “more than suFFicient
to accomodate any problems. In
Fact it is probably so suiiicient
that problems get tied up in bur»
eaucratic problems."

Guittar Felt that more student ac—'
cess to student Facilities were in
order. Among suggestions were to
increase the Forum hours on Fri-
day and Saturday nights For those
students who wanted to go some
place other than the Pub. He also
Felt that the coffeehouse should be
revitalized and darkroom Facilities
should be provided by the school
to accomodate large student inter-
est in photography.

The use 0F Facilities was cited in

'the context oF town-community res

lations. "We don’t use their Fac—
ilities and they don’t use ours.”
Guittar Felt that ”right now Cole
lege-communlty relations are pr-
obably the worst they have ever
been” stressing existing “cultural
advantages be gained From the Gr,
innell community,”

A change in the temper oi the
college was observed by Guittar.
“Grinnell college has taken a she
in away irom radicalism. Heiore
it used to be a considerably more
radical institution and it is a na,
tional trend that college students
are becoming much more aligned
with political, social opinions 0F
the communityratrlarge."

With the recent trend 0F students
not going to graduate school, Guitr
tar Felt, suggested that the college

increasingly "be oriented to pracg

tical training program” in addition
to “graduate school preparation ”

Guittar also suggested the pos-
sibility oi students teaching other
students particularly in the area
oF music lessons. Where interested
beginning students have been unable
to receive lessons due to the small
number 0F instructors available.

John Hansven

John Hansen candidly' stated his
concern in running ior SGA Press
ident. ”What the students really need
to do is to acquire a Son 0F a Bitch
to protect their interest. For that
position 1 wish to apply."
of major importance to Hansen
was the waste oF student political
power in areas where it goes “do-
wn the drain where it won't come
back up.”

Hansen was concerned that SGA
presidents were “working three—
Fourths oF their times as EPC re-
presentatives " The EPC represen-
tatives, Hansen Felt, should assert.
themselves with mlnlmal interior»
ence From the SGA President, the
ough it would continue as a strong
concern.

“Academic policy seems to be in
a large part like making love. You
have to have both parties at least
agreeable to it and 1 don't think the
at the students are interested in any
sort of academic rape."

Other academic concerns included
reconsideration oi credit/iail op—
tions and practicum credit in the
communication Field. .

Policy matters should be dealt
with in an open iashion. Hansen
stated, “More oF the secret com—

'mlttees should be encouraged to

open up. Closed Executive Coun-
all meetings should be the excep-
tion instead oF the rule."

The need for openness was not cons
Fined to just the administration and
the faculty but pertained to the
student government as well. “Any
time that the SGA cabinet is take
ing an action which is either in
the name oi the students or can
be interpreted in the name oi the
students . . . the least they can do
is consult the Joint Boards about
it.”

Alteration oi the Committee From
its Current ”make work” structure
to one that was issue oriented Han-
sen Felt, would be productive. He
saw no need tor the {GA to meet
weekly unless it was necessary.

Concern was expressed about the
social cerordinating committee and
its Functioning with limited Funds.
Hansen believed that possible pack
age deals on entertainment could
be made with other Schools and that
“a healthy injection oi creativity
might be in order."

Hansen wished to direct the po—
wer of SGA into the issue OF OIL
campus housing and cases oi landr
lords taking advantage 01 students.
“A committee could direct the po-
wer of sad in such a way as to
intervene in these disputes, bringr
ing economic, legal, or social sane
ctlons against oiiending landlords."

A junior, Hansen is currently a
house president in Norris Hall.

lmmmmmmmmmmmmm
A sophomore, Charlie Nash, st-
ressed the need {or a little less
diplomacy and more straightsior-
ward talk on the part oF student
leaders.

As a “representative of and ser—
vant to the students," Nash would

avoid the personal level relation»
ship with the administration which

Charles llash

he ielt encourages CD-Optation of
student leaders. A close relation-
ship made it difficult to tell the
administration “screw you all“
when the situation called For it.

From a tactical standpoint, Nash
Felt that the students possessed ire»
mendous power in achieving desir-
ed student ends. “I don't see any
tactic out 0F thE.I book not worth
using.”

When faced with possible admini-
stration opposition, Nash statedposs
sible tactical alternatives. “I call
For a strike, I call For letters to
the Trustees, I call For letters Fr—
om the parents. l'll bring threats
upon reiusing to Finance after peer

pie graduate, and telling, writing,
letters to graduates telling themnot
to give money to the college _, ii—
nancial threats, strikes, well what
else can you do? That’s what.”
Academic pressure was a major
concern oi Nash. “SGA‘s role sh-
ould he to Formulate the academic
policy desired by the students what-
ever it might be.”

Changes should be brought only in
those areas desired by the student.

Nash commented, ”IF everybody lis
kes it the way it is Im not going
to do anything. idon't believe that’s
true. I've talked to so many people
around here that are so dissatise
iied. I know that I’m not happy
with Grinnell.”

As a representative of students
Nash expressed his desire to work
For those things which concerned
them. “I'm not going to be some
kind oF dictator that says, ‘Well,

this is what I think the students
want."

lerrv Seeberger

“The SGA president currently re-
presents, or appears to, only those
Students who are interested in the
affairs oF the SGA, and most of th-
ose students are themselves in the
SGA. The SGA President should
represent all students, whether or
not they are interested, and the
burden should be on the SGA to
Find out how best to represent th-
ese students."

Terry Seeberger, junior, expres-
sed concern about student conti-
dence in SGA. “Many students see
it as just a continuation oi the
student council oi high school" and
see an organization “that lost when
it went before the administration

A P 0 st THE GRINNELL SCARLET a. BLACK MARCH 3,1914 PAGE 5

and Faculty."

A real student apathy was noted
by Seeberger, but one that could
be countered by 2 “real grass
roots work” by the Joint Boards
and SGA cabinet in talking with
students about their concerns. ”SGA
should become more a part oF stu-
dent life," Seeberger emphasized,

More money needed to be allocated
For social Funds and Seeberger Fav-
ored a “minimal" increase in the
student activities Fee. Large Sc-
ale cosoperation with othercoileges
should be Considered to Share so-
clal events with inexpensive trans-
portation provide to the events at
other schools.

Seeherger ottercd the idea otpur- ‘
chasing a WATS une ioi- college/
student use. Other schools have
ateernpted to establish WATS lines
For student use, but have .been re-
iused by the phone company. There
are currently court cases pending
on the matter.

A broader participation in SGA
would be helped, Seeberger Felt, it
students were limited to serving

on one committee position. In addi- ‘

lion, more members oi the SGA
“cabinet should be elected to avoid
"cronyism."

1n academic matters, “SGA sh-
ould take it upon itselF to streng-
then the EPCS" and establish them ‘
other than on an ad hoc basis,
Student representation should also
be sought on the Executive Coun-
cil and the Board OF Trustees.
“I don't think that the SGA should
be limited beforehand by what it
expects the administration will let
it have and will not let it have."

The preservation oi Faculty posi-
tions was a concern of Seeberger's,
“from more than the standpoint
of student-Faculty ratio. “The cut-
ting oi a iaculty position is also a
problem because almost all of the
remaining Faculty would be tenured
and they all might still be around
in Fifteen years." Seeberger sug-
gested that a mutual student-Fac-
ultyeadministration committee Sh-
ould be Formed to consider budge-
tary cuts in all areas so that iac-
ulty positions could be saved.

Jewell Rutherford Hawk has been
a participant in the history of Grlv
nell College and the town 0F Grins
hell. Throughout the years, she
watched and helped Grinnell change
and adds that it is interesting to see
the changes in the college and its
students.

Hawk is uniquely qualiﬁed to come
ment upon the changes. She is a
native oi Grinnell where she spent
much oF her lite. She graduated
From Grinnell High School in 1923
and attended Grinnell College(class
oF 1932) For one year. She leFt
Grinnell to earn her B. S. degree
irom Iowa State University and to
teach homemaking in Milford, IA.
Alter this short leave, Hawk retur-
ned to Grinnell and taught homes
making in the Grinnell High School.

Her experiences in Grinnell are
enriched by her marriage to Rupert
A. Hawk ‘24, He was the local sch—

 

‘ool superintendent prior to joining
the Grinnell College staFF in 1947.
Mr. Hawk was treasurer of the col-
lege For many years and was named
acting president oi the college in
1954 1955

Although the above history suggests
that Jewell Hawk is an excellent
commentator upon Grinnell's hist~
ory, these experiences are over-
shadowed by her career as a Grins
nell history maker:

In March 1961, she was named
hostess manager at Grinnell House
and in 1964, the director oF the
College Forum. Both positions are
speclal because their institution
marked important changes in the
college s history. Also thepositlons
are special because they provided
Hawk with the opportunities to par-
ticipate in and observe interesting
events. people, and changes.

As resident hostess manager oi
Grinnell House, she met many in-
teresting personalities. Guests such

 

as Harry Truman,' Justice William
0. Douglas, Dwight Eisenhower,
Martin Luther King, and Barry Go-

ldwater stayed in Grinnell House.
Arnold Toynbee, an historianrinsres
sidence at Grinnell, oiten held din»
hers and discussions during the ev-
enings at Grinnell House.

‘ Furthermore, the existence oF Grs

innell House marks a change in Cr
innell’s growing history. Grinnell
House, a Georgian colonial at 10“
Park Street, was the home oi the

college presidents since 1917. Part:

1y because of the urgings at former
president and Mrs. Howard Bowen,
the one-time presidential home be-
came the college guest house in
March, 1951,

The house was originally intended
to operate on an “reservations on-
1y” basis. However, the demandup»
on Grinnell House’s guest Facilities
is great and Hawk comments that
Grinnell House is now “just like
a motel.” Unicrtunately, the label
of “motel” does not underscore
the other uses oF Grinnell House
such as For meetings, colloquia.

For one y ar. Student resident man—
agers now take care oi the guests
irom day to day. She is still reSr
ponsible For the guests’ comfort,
the organization oi special events,
and the “mechanical" aspects DF
running the house.

Hawk: Pari'Of Grinnell History

Her experiences in Grinneii are
enhanced by her position as direc-
tor at the College Forum, the ﬁrst
permanent student union since the
early 1500’s. She is responsible
For the building, reservations, help,
and equipment. These responsibil-y
ities allow her to observe some
at the campus changes.

For example, the Coffee Houseus-
ed to he a special “dress-up”place.
At the time, the Coffee House, or
“Cane del Foro" served Cattee
Espresso in diiiering varieties: pl-
ain CaFIe Espresso or Cappuccino
Lorenzo (a combination of (latte
Espresso, steaming milk, stickcin-
namon, essence 0F ruin, topped with
whipped cream) plus Five other-var-
ieties. The menu also OFFei'ed teas,
pariaits, tortes, pastries, cheese
cake, or imported Cheeses.Although
Caﬂe dcl Faro is gone the espres-
so caiiee machine is still operative. ,

The Forum also used to host spe-
cial Friday afternoon coFFees and
discussions in the South Lounge ab-
out twice a month. Students andFac-
ulty either mingled iniormally or
participated in special colioquia.

01 course, the above experiences
are undoubtedly a mere sampling
oi the changes Hawk has seen.
The town oi Grinnell has grown,
the college and its policies have
changed, and the college students
have changed. i

Jewell Hawk is retiring at the end
0! this year with the appointment or
Tom Lattimer as Director oF Cam»
pus Recreational Facilities and Ser»

. vices. She will remain in Grinnell

and will make use of the Freedom
that retirement offers For “spur of
the moment" plans. She also hopes
to become active once again in many
M the organizations to whichshebe-
lo 5. Although she will not be ex-
pli tly connected with the college,
she will remain a participant in
Grinnell's history.
