Campus 'press':
its function

Recent attacks have been made on the legitimacy of a
campus newspaper, Questions have been asked whether there
is enough news to print on such a small campus. Should
students simply withhold 5&5 subscription money and sub,
scribe to the Des Moines Register? Our response is simple. No.
Campus papers have a function. Even this one serves a pur-
pose.

A College paper provides a medium at exchange, It is a
sounding board for the college community. Announcements
are made in it. Opinions are printed in ill The college
newspaper directly reflects the quality of student life on
that campus at any given moment.

The college newspaper is written for the immediate college
community. The paper is read by parents, alumni, trustees,
and contributors to the college. News generally known by all
students is documented in the paper for nonrlowa residents to
read, The newspaper for the non-student is a window to the
'college community.

The newspaper is a document of history. Grinnell College
library binds back copies of the Student newspaper. These
papers can be helpful to historians to determine what ac-
tivities weretaking place on the campus at any given year.

A college newspaper is a training ground. Little ace
reporters sprout in the newsroom, swarm the campus and
return at night to their respective typewriters. The quality of
articles varies with the training and experience of the
newstatt. It takes time to grow a newsperson, it takes time to
create a readable paper.

You who are critical of Campus news media, particularly
the 53-8 consider the alternatives, You could read the campus
memo relidiously. You could hang out in the Burling Library
bathrooms waiting for good runs of gigattittl to break out. You
could subscribe to the Columbia Spectator and read their want
ads. You could even go radical and start your own unr
derground newspaper. if you chose the last be forewarned that
the last radical seen on this campus graduated in 1969.
Reconsider, are not you glad we publish? Where else could you
read such hot stuff?

Vote yes for
bond isSue

A heated controversy, which has been simmering for
months, will come to a head wednesday, Dec. 11. when the
Grinnell-Newburg school bond election is held Eligible to vote
are US. citizens of atlleast 18 years who live in the district.

Passage of the $4,450,000 bond issue would pay for the
construction of a new high school, additions to the Davis and
Fairview elementary schools, and convert the high school into
a iunior high.

Proponents of the bond issue list several items which they
feel require attention: cramped quarters, noisy classrooms,
dangerously old buildings, dimly lit study areas, and problems
with the fire code. Cooper School and Parker School were
closed earlier in the year based on a state tire marshal’s study
of fire hazards.

Opponents argue that the high cost of the bond issue will
raise rents. that the money to pay tor the increase in property
taxes will be difficult to find when the factories are laying all
workers, that there are already too many schools built in the
northern section ot town and none in the southern part and
finally. that the common man will pay for most at the bond
issue and not industry.

Students are eleglble to vote; on-campus residents vote at
the Bailey Park School, 210 8th Avenue.

To date, 11 industries and to service organizations have
supported the bond issue. To pass the issue, voters need to give
60 per cent plus one vote approval.

Because of the natural student interest in education, we
believe this issue deserves the attention of the Grinnell College
community. The question here is one of better education
versus financial interests. The Nixon and Ford ad-
ministrations have adopted an alarming disregard for
education, a policy shift detrimental to the nation. What is
being offered the Grinnell community is a chance to reverse
that trend at the local level.

We urge our readers to support education and vote ”yes"
on the school bond issue Wednesday.

Pub directors clarify rumors

To the Editor:

Many rumors have been clr»
culating in the last two weeks
concerning an incident in the Pub
on Saturday, November 23. The
Pub Club Board of Directors
wishes to clear up any misun-
derslandlng by presenting the
iollolving account ol whal hap
pened.

Following the James Gang Bang,
many people on the campus were
drunk. Ray Blersledt and Dave
Seeberger met for the llrst lime at
ihc Pub after the party. Dave tell
that Ray did not like him from the
outset. lie lcli intimidated by Roy.
Later in the evening, Jeff Wiese
was playing “greaser” complete
with leather jacket, gravity kniic
and woman in low just outside ihc
Pub, Ray,u on seeing Jelfwilh the
knife, aske him to go over to a
lable in the Pub (0 display [he open
knife for someone (Dave
Seeberger). Jel'f did so without any
lnlcnl oi harm nor any knowledge
of whom ihc person was and then
left, Dave, on seeing Ray wilh Jelf
and the knife, felt. that this incident
was related to the earlier incident
with Ray. Extremely intimidated
by the open knife, Dave went to the
police station that night with the
intent to file charges against Jeff.
He was told he couln’l file charges
then but could if he returned on
Monday during the magistrale’s
office hours.

Sunday afternoon, a report was
made to Mark Nissen, Pub Club

Manager, by a barmaid who had

worked ihc previous evening The
report was that a knife light had
occurred. Mark decided he needed
to consult other witnesses. These
witnesses corroborated the story.
Mark then went. to talk with Dave.
Knowing that as manager of the
Pub he is contracted lo insure the
safety of Pub patrons, Mark
decided to file a misdemeanor
charge oi assault against Jel'f.
Upon hearing that. Mark was going
to file charges, Dave decided not to
ﬁle charges but that he would be a
witness in the case. Monday
morning Mark l'iled charges.

Tuesday alternoon .leli was
arrested in chemistry lab. He was
released on bail Soon after.
Tuesday night .ieti, Dave. and
Mark all met at the Pub to talk
things over. At this meeting Mark
realized that the situation had been
blown way out at proportion. At
this point, the Board of Directors
became aware or the story, too,
During Mark’s meeting with Jeff
and Dave, he had agreed to drop
charges ii the proper apologies
were made. The Board, however,
decided that it needed to in
vesiigale the incident in order to

determine whether the righi steps
had been taken. Al the request at
the Board, Mark did not drop
charges until they had time to
meet. The Board met Wednesday
night and heard Mark's account.
The Board reprimanded Mark for
acting independently or the Board
in so serious a matter. It was
decided to meet with Ray, Dave,
Jeff, and Mark. This meeting was
held Friday night and the [acts
were presented as they appear
above. The Board directed Mark lo
drop the charges against Jeff. The
Pub memberships of Ray and Jeff
were suspended lor the remainder
of the semester.

The Board regrcls that. people
have been inconvenienced and that
individuals‘ reputations may have
been damaged.

Although we are sorry that this
incidenthad lhe repercussions that
it did. as ihc Board oi Directors we
feel duty-bound at. this time lo
remind the campus communily
lhal we are responsible ior
maintaining the Pub as a safe and
pleasant place for its members.
Consequently, it is our respon-
slbllily, and Mark‘s responsibility
as our agcni. lo deal wilh
troublesome behavior as we see fit,

Miller: answers Esyenboch

Dear Editor:

In a recent lcilcr to the sludenl
body titled “Second Chance,”
Dean Eysenbach suggests that the
reasons tor the light enrollment in
the a crcdll Humanities program
must be due lo some misunr
derslanding of the nature or the
program, or some ”rash" over»
sightof its presence and value, She
also suggests that it is sad lhai
more at us aren't interested in an
interdisciplinary approach lo
educlion.

[would like lo oricr some oi ihc
reasons ihal l, and many other
students 1 have spoken wilh, opled
lo “rashly” overlook the program
this spring. 1 don’t think an in-
lerdisciolinary course is the only

place a student. can coordinale and

assimlllate ideas picked up in the
various departments and areas or
study at Grinnell. Although i have
never participated in an in-‘
lerdisciplinary program here, i
rind myself, amazingly enough,
considering connections between
various cultural, historical, and
literary ideas. We students even
discuss, on occasion. ideas picked
up in various classes with one
another oulslde of the classrooms,
although these ideas often
originate at opposite ends oi the
vast spectrum of the liberal arts
education,

But one or the big reasons many
students (myself included) are
rashly rejecting the Encredil
humanities blitz this spring is fear
of the work involved. Last spring, I
watched as my perfectly sane and

healthy roommate degenerated to
a state or quivering lunacy at the
hands or Rousseau, Connelly,
Smiih, and Newton. On one oc-
casion during Iinals wcck last May
Icame home in ﬁnd him sprawled
on the ﬂoor in an act of iinal subr
mission and defeat, sipping
placidly irom a plastic bolllo of
Breck Shampoo ior Normal Hair,
after one oihis typical allrnight-allr
day attempts lo “enlighten"
himself from the Enlightenment!
I’m sure, min the all~star cast
offering these courses, that they
are all excellent. But i glless some
oi us just aren't ready for the
”interdisciplinary approach" yel.
Thanks ior the “second chance,"
but no thanks.

Mark Miller
