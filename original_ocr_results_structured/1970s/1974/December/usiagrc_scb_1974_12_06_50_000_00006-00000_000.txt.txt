Where

by Michael Chessler

(As you well remember irom
belore, I had just left Arno, and
was on my way to Holt, Rinehart
& Winston) Holt is a rather large
publishing house with a number of
subsidiaries, Finding one's way
around one of these operations can
be quite grueling, not to say
defeating, and I think that deep
down that is the main object7
break the person and they'll buy
anything you sell them.

Anyway, when I iinally round the
correct person at l-lolt, i asked her
about obtaining reviewers' copies
and she told me that all the
reviewers already had thier
copies. Not quite comprehending
her train of thought I explained
that I was inquiring about ob-
taining reviewers copies ior
myseli, to which whe responded,

do your boo

“And who are you?"

“I" said I. and went on to tell
her. She gave me one oi those I-
know what you're really -aiter
looks, wrote down the address and
told me that this kind oi business is
conducted by mail and that I’d
have to send them a letter ex-
plaining what it is l wanted and
they would consider it in light oi its
merits, ( and achievements i
thought she would add). Then, with
the inlarmation sheet I left.

On to Iloughton Milllin

l-loughton Miiilin is, lsoon iound
out, a Boston based company with
only a small branch in New York.
That meant, essentially, that 1
could not arrange ior reviewers
copies directly in New York.
Luckily and unusually, the people
there were quite nice. So nice, in

fact, that they said they would take
care of the arrangements,
providing that 1 reviewed the
better part of the books. “Fair
enough,” lsaid. Surprisingly, the
oiiices oi Scribncrs, where the

publicity department is. looked
like they were just recovering irom
“hurricane whatever.” Most oi the
people were walking around
without shoes, either in their
stocking ieet, or bareioot, on the
wall to wall carpeting, and not
paying much attention to the fact
that I entered

When i was eventually led to the
correct desk, a woman emerged
irorn behind a mountain oi papers
and other paraphenalia and asked
me what 1 wanted. lgave her my
now well developed introduction
and gulped, waiting for her to give
me one oi the unhelpiul responses I
had already become quite used to.
But, alas, she was as pleasant and
helpiul as the woman at Houghton
Miiilin and gave me the same type
oi iniormation and instructions.

Stein&[12\y
Anyway, Stein 8t Day. my next
stop, had luliilled all may
publishing expectations. Their
otiice was more a mess then
Scribners. but i had not reallv
thought it would be any dilicrent,

ks come from?

For the first time in my sojourn.
through the halls oi publishing, I '

was asked how i was, what my
name was, etc.—a politeness
whose existence I had given up all
hope oi encountering. ln addition,
this was the first place that Said
that they’d be happy to send me all
their new releases, providing I
review the better part oi them.
How could I refuse? At this point it
began to be a good day.

My last stop oi any interest was
McGrawrl-Iill. Now this was by iar
the most complex and the largest
oi all the publishers I had visited,
When i iinally lourid the publicity
department, and then the correct
division of that, they were as
courteous as could be hoped,
I rounded out my day with visits
to the rest or the standard
publishers, all to either no avail or

without event Now all I need to do D

is hear irom these publishers.

perhaps worst at all, read them.

Students possess ESP potential

by mark ciitan

it is 99.99 per cent certain that
some Grinnell students have exe
trasensory perception. This cone
clusion is based on the Esp ex
periment conducted a iew weeks
ago. The ligure 99 99 per cent
comes irom an analysis oi the
experimental data using a stan-
dard statistical method used by
many Esp experimenters,

At the start oi the experiment, a
list oi sequences was comprised oi
plus and minus symbols arranged
in random order, The list, called
the target slicet, had 52 sequences.
Each sequence corresponded to a
particular response sheet. The
object ot the experiment was ior
each oi the subjects to guess the
order ol the symbols in the
corresponding sequence. 300
response sheets were distributed
[or subjects to record their

guesses Each target sheet has
lorty slots tor the guesses. The
response sheets instructed the
subject to record his iirst 20
guesses in slow succession and his
second 20in rapid succession. l-lair
the response sheets had in-
structions telling the subject to
take the test in the morning; the
rest had instructions telling them
to take it in the evening Each
response sheet had a questionnaire
on the hack designed to determine
how the subject tell about Esp and
Esp experiments.

By chance, so per cent oi the
guesses should have been correct.
The chart below shows the actual
results at the experiment,

The higher the total number oi
guesses the more signiiicant the
percent correct,

distinction between the scores
achieved under the opposing
variables of the three conditions.
The most signiiicant result is the
total oi 54 per cent correct out oi
the total number of responses
which could have happened by
chance only one of 12,500 times.
