Commenting on the importance

In announcing the lee increase,
President Glenn Leggett said:

the inﬂationary rises in costs are
such that the fee increase is

and Will! the Young Artists
Program at SUNY, Binghamton,
The group is the third to hold the
position of ai‘tiSt-insresidence at
Grinnell

In l962 the residency was created
to bring renewed interest and
activity in chamber music, not
only to Grinnell but also through
out the middle-states area, The
position has grown from one of
mainly periorming, lecturing and
giving seminars to one which now
also includes teaching oi courses.

Future plans oi the quartet as of
now are indeiinite. However,
concerning the past, Lewis said oi
his years at Grinnell, “I feel
satislled. l have Seen students of
mine grow and we have grown as a
group. With the set-up here oi eight
concerts 3 semester, we have had
the chance to experiment; usually
with successes but a few times with
failures, which have in themselves
proven educational.”

Presently the administration
plans to replace the quartet with a
trio. Dean Walker said that the
decision tor a trio not only stems
med irom a budgeting standpoint
but also from the standpoint of
giving at dilierent aspectiof sen.

“To maintain such an effort on a
stable basis, Grinnell must have
the means tor retaining a high
quality iaculty, and this is possible
only it salaries are fully coms
petitive with those at comparable
colleges. increases in iaculty and
staii compensation are therefore
essential if Grinnell is to continue
to assure its students a first-rate
education ”

Leggett assured parents and
Students that ”we are aware of the
additional burden the lee increase
will place on many oi our Grinnell
families. To lessen this burden as
much as possible, the college will
expand its ﬁnancial-aid resources
so that qualiﬁed students may not
be barred from attending the
college."

Parents are being iniormcd oi
the new charges by lctter this
week. In the letter, Leggett notes
that “as in the past, this increase
has been held to the lowest amount
consistent with budgetary needs,
and it is in line with the increases
being imposed by other com-
parable colleges,”

Class dismissals push move
to limit faculty

Dean Walker met with a joint
SGA session Wednesday, Nov. 6, to
discuss their motion that
legislation be enacted to prohibit
iaculty members [rcm excluding
ill-prepared students from their
classes. The recommendation,
proposed by will Collins, in its
current form suggests that
students have a right to class
participation and attendance and
that this right should not be
suspended tor any reason other
than actual calssroom disruption.

SGA president John Hansen
explained that this reeomendation
resulted from multiple dismissals
oi students trom classes as punish
ment tor ill prepardedness, Whole
classes have been dismissed ahead
of schedule for the same reason,

Hansen discussed student
irresponsibility. He said, “Grinnell
is a high pressure institution. The

student who is occasionally “n,

prepared ior class . should not
suffer the wrath of the faculty ‘for

irresponsbility."

Walker countered that the ads
minsitration can not take a
legislative stance on this issue.
Legally, the limits of classroom
authority have not been
established Walker informed the
council meeting that tenured
professors who have been
dismissed for malfeasance at other
institutions are now testing their
case in the Courts.

SGA and Dean Walker agreed
that the dismissal issue was one of
a whole spectrum oi issues con
cerning a lack of community at
Grinnell. Walker is concerned,
should studenHaculty [ac-
tionalism continue. “Trouble,” he
stated, “is due in part to iaculty
insecurity and the lack ol com-
munication between junior and
senior iaculty members,” He
continued, “It is awfully easy to
became paranoid under these
conditions.”

Walker assured the council that

authority

action was being taken in
matter, An executive faculty
committee session will be held to

discuss the matter. _
in a personal conclusion walker

stated, “With a iaculty oi we must
expect some at them to be ec-
centric. l.don’t know why certain
members must act so pompous,
These things represent weaknesses
or the proiessor rather than
weaknesses oi the students."
