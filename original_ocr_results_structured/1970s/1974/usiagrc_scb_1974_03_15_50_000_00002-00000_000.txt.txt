The Health Center has not been

used to its fullest potential over
the last several years, There
clearly is a need [or sonic sort
of change within the Health CL‘
tor and in the :tCrViCCs it Dro-
vidt-s, \l'hcihcr that change me'
ans an expansion of those :7ch
vices or just a revision or Curl"

The following recommendations
have been proposed to thc chlr
[h Services Sub'Conllllilrocv in
three parts.

The first port of thc rscol‘n-
mendatmus, which involvu ﬂdmt
tnlslrativc matters that are open
to immediate action, includes an
expansion of the current ofhcc
hours, a liberalization of \‘lsit'
ing hours, and llmlts upon the
number of Visitrlrn‘ allowed [U

is a relaxation of-thc Currznl inc
formal policy that anyone atlmil‘
ted to the center as a patient
must remain thL‘rC [or 24 hours.

Action has alruady bctn taken
on these proposals. Ofilcc htr

of the lobby to make a less for'

of nurscs to wear more casual

make conscious attempts to mix

This could be accomplished by

would include moving s ed

of much more scX‘relaied infor-
mation at the center. The number
of available pamphlets and brat
chures on all aspects of health

be increased.

Among other services of the

ation are for enlarging the cur-

More suggestions are forgiving

students more of a voice in de-
ciding who is hired to staff the
center, re-consideration 0f es-
tablishing a "sick-tray" service
for ill students, investigation Of
possible uses for excess patient
rooms at the Health Center, and
college cooperation with the town
in setting up adequate methods
and facilities for handling sev-
ere mental disorders withoutha-
ving to go first to lowa City.

There is one last proposal; one
that might provide a total revic
sion ofthe Health Center's operae
tion in the future. This proposal
is for the\ investigation of the
feasibility of establishing a Hea—
lth Maintenance Organization for
the college. Such an organiza-
tion, (including the services of
a couple of doctors), would have
the sole responsibility ofadmin-
istering to the health needs of
the entire college community of
students, faculty, staff, and their
families. At present, the plan is
unfeasible because of federaland
state regulations but HMO could
become reality if these shatutes
are changed.

Until then. Grinnell should be
able to get by satisfactorily with
the modifications of its Health
Service that have been proposed
to the college.
