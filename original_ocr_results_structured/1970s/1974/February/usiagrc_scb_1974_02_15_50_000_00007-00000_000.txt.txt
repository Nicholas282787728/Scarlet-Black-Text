THE GRINNELL SCARLET 1i BLACK FEBRUARY 15, 1974 PAGE

Gary Farr, Farr In

by Bruce Green
For those oi you who have not
had the dubious pleasure at hearing
' my radio show on KDIC, allow me to
introduce myseli, this column, and
the whole sordid aIIair 01 Campus
music news. I am the Fatman,
Bruce Green, (an honor I earned
when I passed the 200 pount mark),
and this column will Comprisccam-
pus music news, record reviews,
and various and sundry musical
events both here on Campus and in
The Great Outside.
As far as reviews are concerned,
I will not be writing all the reviews
you see in either this column or
the paper, there are several others
who will be reviewing records as
well, This Stat! of reviewers is
created to insurethatthepersonwho
reviews a record is a person who
knows at least something about the
type (II music he is reviewing. This
will partially alleviate a problem
with reviewers elsewhere, (as most
working musicians will tell you in
words of one 01‘ two syllables that
describes the morals and ancestry
oi the reviewer and aren’t nece»
ssarity in any but the best unabrid-
ged dictionaries.)

My ﬁrst review is on a gentleman
named Gary Farr, whose debut alr
hum, To The Censnrs of Love, has
recently been released On‘AIco(SD
7034). It is a good album or medium
hard rock, in the tradition at Elton
John and D011 Maclean.

His backup consists or guitars,
saxes, and brass, aswellasrhythm,
and heanens one brass player with
the use DI more than Just guitars
and drums In backing rock vocale
ists, since there is Dnly so much
that one can do with that combi-
nation of instruments. Farr himsell
is a vocalist, and a good one, with
a pleasing English accentuaLIOn and
pronunciation to some or his words,
but also with a strong blues-orient-
ed phrasing which was probably
picked up when he worked backup
to visiting blues artists likeT-Bone
Walker and Mose Allison. Heplayed
for ﬁve years With an Englishgroup,
the T—Bones, which, {or most of
the time he was there, alsoincluded
the great Keith Emerson.

Farr also plays twelve-string gui—
tar and harmonica, and CDnLributeS
much to his own backup. The best
song on the album tor solo work
Is “I’m a King Bee,” by Slim
Harpo, which contains a good rock-
Ing blues vocal, and well pericrmed
solos by sax and trumpet as well.

Road Service

leo's Standard

SIXTH El WEST

Easily the test track on the al-
bum is “Rhythm King," a love son-
of Sorts, and very poetic in theme-
tradition, Another superior track is
“Mexican Sun,” a lesson in 0bs-‘
curity 0! lyrics, with many ret-
erences to the old Siren myths o
the Odyssey.

Other good tracks are "General’s
Daughter,” another love song or
gentler variety, “White Bird," and
“I’ll be your Rocket," amorerock-
andrroll vocal than thesotter, slow-
er, vocals mentioned previously.

The lyrics,all written by rarrsave‘
“I’m a King Bee," are quite defi~
nitely the best feature at the album,
Mostly about loves and lovers, they
are generally explicit and leave
little to the Imagination, but are
niehter vulgar nor dull. For sheer
poetry, the track “General'sDaugh-
ter” is the finest on the album,
and among the best poetry I have
heard since “Suzanne,” His mel-
Odies are fairly simple, sometimes
too simple, but effectively handled
nonetheless, and the lyrics aresung
both Intelligentiy and. intelligibty,
(which is a complaint I have had in
the past with some other rock sing~
ers.)

Perhaps the best wayto sumupthe
album is this; it you're Iooking.i'or
a classic along the lines of Hot
Rocks Or American Pie—KeeanOkr
ing. But it you just want to listen
to some pleasing rock vocals that:
have a tendency to sometimes make
you think, this album is as good as
any and better than most.
