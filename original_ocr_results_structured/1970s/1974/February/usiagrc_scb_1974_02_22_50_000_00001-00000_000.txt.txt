rAdmissions Face‘ Future Shock

Q

by Elaine Carey

A sharp drop in students at Grin—
nell has been predicted by the Midr
west Research Institute (MRI) whose
recent study forecasts an enroll-
ment DI 850 students [or 1985. Cole
lege oIIicials at Grinnell question
the validity oithese iigures, although
they concede a decrease in college
applications.

Grinnell oiiicials appeared skepti»
cal about the Iindings oi theTeport,
sponsored by the Higher Education
Facilities Commission oi Iowa, who
icii says Iowa Iaces a declining
college»age population and a growr
ing tendency among students to attr
end vocational and special training
colleges.

“There is no question that Iowa’s
private colleges are iinding it in-
creasingly diiiicult to maintain en-
rollments,” D. Nicholas Ryan, dean
oi admissions and iinancialaid, said
in an interview last week. ”How-
ever, the majority oi Grinnell Col-
lege students come here irom other
states and i am contident that, due
to our high quality taculty and the
academic program,'we shall conti-
nue to attract well—qualified stur
dents in numbers greater than prer
dicted in this particular enrollment
study."

LOOKING l
AHEAD

ii the MRI study is correct, nyan
pointed out that “it is clear that
some oi the private colleges in the
state would not remain open, as a
result, the student expected to be

enrolled would likely transfer to
other colleges in the state, thereby
increasing their enrollments. "

Assessing Grinnell’s present adr
missions, Ryan is hopeiul that appr
lications will pick up in February.
High school counselors indicate that
seniors are applying more slowly
because colleges have more room
than in the past.

Admissions counselors {or Grin-
nell, Stephen Carroll and Roger
Koester, Veriiied this slow down by
reporting that the heavy applica-
tion months this year appear to be
January through March, rather than
the normal heavy period ot Nov-
ember through January Other ACM
schools are experiencing the same
slow trickle oi applications, Carroll

and Koester added

The alternative options oi junior
college and vocational training pro~
grams, mentioned by the MRI re-
port, Carroll and Koester agreed
were interesting more students,

Two oil-campus Associated Coll-
eges oi' the Midwest (ACM) pro-
grams recently gave birth to sis-
ter programs, alter realizing some
shortcomings

The Costa Rican Development st-
udies Program and the Arts oiLonr
don and Florence Program will re
main as spring semester oiierings,
but their sister‘ programs will take
over the tall. , -

The summeretall segment of the
Costa Rican program will be re-
placed by a Latin American Stud»
ies program, with emphasis on Spr
anish language and Latin American
culture. The original Costa Rican
program, with its emphasis oniield
research and biology and the em-
piricallyeoriented social sciences,
will continue to operate in the sp-
ring.

Costa Rica campus advisor, Pro-
iessor Robert Voertman, explained
why the original ACM program has
been altered tor the tall term. He
Ieltlthat there was an inbalance
in the proportion oi students in the

summer»tall segment and the spring
term.

He Said that both semesters were
identical, except that the earlier
one had to start in July, due to
the shorter fall semester Fewer
students applied ior this iirst term,
which Voertman attributed to a Stu-
dent’s unwillingness to give up his
summer.

The new Latin American Studies
semester in Costa Rica will cater
more to Spanish, history and psy-
chology majors than the original
program, which showed strong sup-
port irom biology, economics, anthr
ropology, sociology and Political
Science majors.

Courses oiiered will be within the

basic areas of Latin American lan—
guage and literature, drama, ethr
nography and ecology, with an inde—
pendent study option available. Voe
ertman stated that the [all inde~
pendent could be used by science

tending the more scieniiiic spring
term.

The present Arts of London and
Florence Program, aimed at the
nonrmawr, will continue to be our

rail semestcrprogram will provide
15 weeks only in Florence, lor
majors in art, history, modern lane
guages and the humanities.

The new lall Florencep gram was
created alter students cri cized that
the time spent in London and in
Florence‘ was too short {or ader
quate study and that either one or
the other city should he chosen
for more in-depth study.

Professor Grafton Boehner, came
pus sponsor tor the London/Flor—
ence and Florence semester, stated
that the new program has not yet
been brought up to the Board olUlI-
Campus Studies, but feels that its
approval is “more than likely,”

The Florence semester appeals .

directly to art and art history ma-
jors, according to Boehner, although
the program demands no prorrer
quisites. Fall 1974 Courses will
include Italian language and introe
duction to the arts OI Florence,
early Italian history and culture,
renaissance'history, Italian middle
ages, Michelangelo, contemporary
Italy and an independent study ope

according to the high school couns
selors they’ve spoken with recently.

At the present, no statistics are
available on the applications for this
year since admissions are in the
midst of receiving and evaluating
applications. Counselors, Carroll
and Koester, expect the admissions
process to continue through May
this year due to the slow receipt
of application, Usually, admissions
would complete evaluation oi app-
lications in April, according to Care
roll and Kuester.

Cost is a key reason tor decreas
ing applications, according to Ryan.
He explained that the approximate
$4000 fee puts Grinnell way above
the cost of State schools. A few
years ago, Ryan noted, the diIIr
erence between attending Grinnell
and a state school was about $1000.
Now that iigure has doubled, putting

Responding to the close Senate vote
Wednesday approving the controver—
sial Sortoot double bottom truck
bill, Kramer said, “It is a mis—
take hurting all of Iowa.”

She added that Governor Robert
Ray might veto the bill, and added,
“ISPIRG has a very good rapport
With the governor.”

Income Down, Projects Stalled

by Dee Dee Goldie

Low second semester enrollment
will apparently iorce mm to reiuse
requests tor special iunding ior
groups or ideas not in the current,
budget.

In a report to Wednesday's SGA
meeting, Treasurer Ed Hirsch exp
plained that second semester en,
rollment totals 1180 students -»
about 50 below the normal second
semester totals.

Hirsch said he had “budgeted low”
when tiguring the current years
financial commitments. but that the
unexpectedly low enrollment would
leave SGA little money in Generr
al Budget and Reserve (G B o R)
accounts ior special allocations.

In an interview following themeet—
ing, Hirsch said no items already
in the budget were in danger at
present. However, he noted that

at the SGA meeting, Vanderhyden
proposes that a piece oi college

perience tor students, expecially
those who come irom a metropol»

participate in real lowa living. it

would also provide summer jobs
