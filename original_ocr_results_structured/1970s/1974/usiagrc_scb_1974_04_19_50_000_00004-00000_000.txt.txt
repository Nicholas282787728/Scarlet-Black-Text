A Magnificent Gift

We are all delighted at the anonymous giftof more than $4 million
dollars which was announced earlier this week. It will give badly
needed help to several areas withinthc College,including American
Studies, Burling Library, and the Fine Arts programs.

All especially exciting portion of the gift is the half-million
dollar section which is allocated for 3 “President’s Fund.”
The fund will give Gf'innell the opportunity it has long needed
to pursue worthwhile academic programs, to innovate, to ex»
periment. ,

President Glenn Leggett described the money as risk capital,
and we find this apt phrasing. Grinnell can now take arisk on
a program that sounds promising but has no track record.

We hope that there will be true innovation in using this money,
and that the President’s Fund will not simply become one of many
contingency funds that exist in various dark corners throughout
the College.

/

However, Grinnell must not allow itself to become complacent.
This new gift, magnificent though it is, does not eliminate the need
for the College to seek fundingforavariety of programs and propo-
sals.

Specifically, there is now a master plan for the computer center
that will require money to implement. Similarly, there is a need
for money for the planned interdisciplinary program in COm‘lJl’ll-
cations.

And, as reported last week, several sections of the budget have
been cut to keep it in balance. It would take moley to restore those
cuts.

Contingency funds are important, too. Grinnell needs more money
available to handle not new ideas but rather unexpected price rises
or emergency programs. The recent fuel crisis isbut one example.

Grinnell is strange} because of this generous gift. But, more is
needed, and we hope that potential donors will not feel that their
generosity is not needed. It is.

NOT Welcome

Grinnell’s investigation into the charges levelled against Anne R,
Ah‘er and J. Richard Woodworth has ground to a half
Abler and J. Richard Woodworth has ground to ahalt following
the entry of the American Association of University Professors
into the case.

It is unfortunate that an outside organization, like the AAUP,
chose this point in the investigation to involve itself. It appears
to us that the so -called Willi Committee was making a fair-minded
effort to separate fact from rhetoric on both Sides, and to put the
CBS charges into proper perspective.

We will never know what their conclusion might have been.
because they have been efﬁciently silenced by the outside inter~
ference of the AAUP.

Certainly, no one can deny that Abler and Woodworth have the
right to advice and counsel from any individual or group they
wish to consult. What is unfortunate is that an attempt was made
by one such counsellor to change l‘l: ground nlles before the
preliminary work could be completed.

What is even more unfortunate is that someone outside the
College chose to involve the statewide media in this particular
phase of the case, by sending an anonymous tip to 3 Des Moines
newspaper. This apparently was an effort toinsurethat the investi-
gation could never be completed.

We, as newspeople can never condone
institution. But the Wall Committee was conducting aprbceeding
not unlike that of a grand jury. We are sorry that they could not
be allowed to complete their work. They, and we, are working
towards the same goal -- finding out the facts.

Yacknin Objects to $8.8 Coverage

To the Editors:

The coverage {or lack thereof) of
the controversy surmundingthcten-
ureship of Mr. Fudge is one of
the best examples of journalistic
irresponsibility which the 5&83135
exhibited thus far this year. Although
there was admittedly (even by John
Wylie) much controversy over the
decision, Jo'rlwllie refused to pr»
int more than a paragraph (and
then, only a’ter the Trustee meeting)
about the incident. John told int-that
he didn’t print the story because no
involved students were willing to be
quoted, because the story involved
more and possib‘y slanderous alleg-

Payelte: like Paper,
Hale 4 letter Words

To the Editors:

It has been with eagerness that I
have awaited each issue of the
S it B and with enthusiasm thateach
has been read. You and your staff
are to be commended for the re-
search and careful writing thathave
gone into the stories on the food and
health services. The story on the
college calendar in the April 5th
edition clearly will awaken alumnae
to the changes in the operation of
the college. The editorial, “1 Don’t
Know" makes a point well taken.
Bruce Green’s memorial to his bro-
ther is touching and outstanding in
my opinion.

Nonetheless, as Fund Director for
the Class of 1952, I hope that no
other alumnae subscribe to the“: B.
it has been all to apparent in several
issues thatyoureditorialpolicy does
not exclude from the content of let-
ters, stories, and, finally on April
5th editorials, four letter words. It
is obvious'fl'om reading the S it B
that your writers do not have inade-
quate vocabularies. It is possible
to disagree violently with another
and make a point stick without the
use of four letter Words. The intell—
igence of your readers is insulted.
Even the women leading your edi-
torial did not need the shock value
of the quotation from the lavatory
wall.

To the extent that the S 52 E is
the only stultnt work that a given
alumnus sees, you are undermin-
ing the work that the class fund
directors are attempting to accom-
plish. i write to urge you to cease
and desist from this practice.

Putting that aside, keep up tlle good
work.

Yours truly,
Bob Fayette, Jr., ‘52
Class Fund Director

aliens, and because he didn’t want
the St"? to become “an advocate
for people who don’t want to make
their crvll statements."

John Wylie was right: he does not
have an obligation to print libelous
remarks. He was incredibly bllnll,
however, if he cou‘d not see that
certain verifiable facts were also
involved. Tile facts are as follows:
1) based on both public evidence
and its own im'ormsiion, the Exe—
cutive Council voted to tenure Mr.
Fu 7:3; 2) the public evidence (the
ll'llS tulionalized Grapevine cues»
tionnaires and the 84-page Misic
EPC report’s conclusions) were 07-
erwhelmingiy negative towards Mr.
Fudge; 3) a large number of stu-
dents trekked m Leggett uluw-usk.
er’s ofﬁces for two weeks following
the EC decision; 4) students with
extensive backgrounds in Grinnell
music tried to talk with the Exe-
cutive Council about its decision;
the ac refused to adult them; 5)
the students relayed to the EC
via Mr. Walker that they were nl—
arming to go to the Trustees about
the decision; a) between Wednesday
and Thursday, something happened
which made the students changcthe-
ir minds; they decided not to app—

roach the Trustees.

lf these facts no not suggest a
possible story worttw of investi-
gation, then I must be incredibly
naive about the criteria of a worth-
while story. The son, as the Col-
lcge’s only newspaper, has an ob-
ligation to print what is goilg on
within the College, despite those
whom the news may affect. Tile
above list includes facts, not slan-
derous allegations, and to refuse
to print them does not mean that
the facts will no longer exist or
that the controversy and disgust
with the Executive Council’s deci-
sion will instantly disappear.

It is apity that the 8&8 limits
its investigatory role to such mzlt-
ters as what the College telephone
operator does (the one major excep»
tich was the Health Center series),
and refuse to print personnel can-
troversies because they may be
sticky. Hopefully, next year‘s ed-
itors will have the courage to rely
more on investigative journalism
and to print more controversial st~
orles than this year’s editor has
done.

- Aronin:
Glad He left Grinnell

To the Editors:

As a past student of Grinneil, I
have taken interest in the contin-
uing increase of tuition and other
fees at this seemingly soon to be
obsolete institution. in my opinion,
the amount which one is expected
to lay out for a Grinnell education,
or perhaps, more aptly, as the cat-
alog would put it, experience, is
totally out of whack with the payoffs

, one receives for ones dollars.

Since leaving Grinnell I have att-
ended the University of Oregon and
have found my professors to be eq-
ual or superior to my Grinnell pro-
fessors, and have also found the
wider range of courses and activi—
ties a much more realistic "exper-
ience” than Grinnell’s emaciated
pub-library-forum trip. I seeahso-
lutely no advantage in attending Gr-
inhell over a large, decent univer-
sity, other than perhaps the higher
value of a Grin diploma. At 3 sm-
ll, isolated school such as Grihnell,
there is less to do, less people to
do it with and thanks to the Stu-
dents ceaseless desire to crush and
climb over each other inthelrhead-
long drive to grad school, much less
time to do it in.

There are those who would argue
that Grinnell is an option; an alter-
native for those who want a more
scholarly atmosphere and a more
personal treatment. Well as for the
scholarly atmosphere, if you think
you’re gonna go out into the world
and live with a neighborhood of peo~
pie with homogeneous board scores
and a bunch of bullshit diplomas
hanging out of their sweaty palms,
fine~~but if you’re not Grinnell’s
scholarly atmosphere comes off to
me only as elitism and intellectual
chauvenism. To use intellect, or
more actually knowledge, as the only
genuine criteria for education is a
sad and major mistake.

And for the personal treatment,
I might say that at Oregon, there
are no D: it checklists at meals-
rather the students names are used;
and as far as professor availability
and Student interest goes, the notion
that presupposes that a prof at abig
school is less interested in his or
her students is outright bullshit,
and personally I have found the profs
here tobe readily available and much
warmer on the whole than the Grin-
nell instructors iencountered.

I’m not writing this letter just to
bitch about Grinnell, as I’m sure
some faithfuls Will accuse, but mt~
her to point out to those who are
maybe still there, but abit unper-
,taih, you ought to try a change,

, you’ve got nothing to lose but 3’ few
artificial discussions over a Forum
hamburger and milkshake.
