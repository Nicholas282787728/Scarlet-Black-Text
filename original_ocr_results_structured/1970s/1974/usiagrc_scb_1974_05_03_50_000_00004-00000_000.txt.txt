who tries to pick up the reins in med-semester from a smoothly
running machine. What was once a seemingly effortless coordi—
nation of campus activities, issues and controversies into the
Scarlet and Black becomes an awesome responsib ity.

Yet a change in command is good, for otherwise a newspaper
becomes a personal creation, which must eventually falter and die.
New editors must bring new enthusiasm to subjects which have
become too wearisome to contemplate. One of these concerns is
the determination of the proper role, function and philosophy of

the college press.

To begin with, the newspaper is the only student voice supported
with college funding and regularly diseminated. Thus the res-
ponsibility of representing every student lies with us We accept
that responsibility, and extend an invitation to the entire campus

community to fill our pages with your complaints, questions, i ‘

creativity and inspirations. Furthermore, we feel that every mem-
ber of the college who claims to represent others either educa—
tionally, politically or socially has an obligation to communicate
with their constituents. There can be no more effective medium
for this purpose than the Scarlet and Black.

We are a student newspaper: student sponsored, student oriented,
student run The Scarlet and Black will not be dominated bya
clique, unless you allow it to be run byaweak skeletal staff,

unsupported by student muscle.

God Save The People

This week, due to the action of providence’s newest play toy,
_we had a national day of prayer, fasting and humiliation. ,Of course,
in this day and age, what with government figures constantly
coming under public scrutiny, one can easily see why they'would
want to pray. What I can not see is why they wish to inflict their
prayers on an entire nation.

I am a Christian, as such I can in no way reﬂect ‘the viewpoint
of anyone other than myself. My IM and my Christ are both very
personal beings. My religious belief is one in which I own my God
as much as he owns me. I cannot accept the Congressional Elk
cyclical seriously, simply because I can not believe' in a National
God. National God is on the same level as National Lampoon. It
says that everyone in the nation sort of owns a piece of the rock,
whether they want it or not. I like the idea of Socialism, but when
someone attempts to nationalize God, I get.off the bus. When
Something, even God, is owned in common by everyone, it belongs
to no one and even God, when taken from each individual as a free
right, when formalized, no matter how meaningfully, by any
entity and claimed as national heritage, loses his meaning, his

vitality and his brilliance."K ‘.

Everyone has his own cross to hear, his own sins to pray for.
these are many and grievous enough to occupy one forever. ”It
is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness." If every-

. one were to light their candles together, the national soul, if
_ there is one, would be saved. But as things are, this nation has
not only committed sins against God, but has used his name in the
process. This country has used God, emphasis on the word used,
too cavalierly, too many times to make such aweak cosmetic
effort. The Congressional Bull has no spiritual force behind it,
therefore the name truly fits in the most bovine sense of the word.

There is a question of legality involved. After the courts banning
prayer in public schools, after thousands of decisions in favor of
religious freedom, after the long ago stated decision for the sep-
aration of Church and State, can Congress as abody recognize
God as an entity? Do atheists have rights in this country? Is this
religious tolerance? Atheists have a religion too!

As a‘ human being, I am thoroughly offended and bothered by a
national body so pretensious and puffed-up as to think that they
can legislate God. I think it proves that at least Congress, if no
one else, needs a day of humiliation. If God is not mocked, he
most certainly is not coopted.

Frank: Defends National
Day of Humiliation

To the editors:
‘5 letter is in response to that
Younixwho?) in last weeks
syn, which he wrote to object to
a national day of humiliation, fast-
ing and prayer.

Whether or no: Mr. Youno or any-
one else for that matter believes
in God has nothing whatsoever to do
with the fact that God does exist.
And that the only way this country

is going to do anything but continue .

to rapidly decline is for its people
to do exactly as tie Senate has sug—
gested in this declaration, to ac-
knowledge its national sins and 3D»
peal to its Creator and, by the way,
its s tier. But God will not sus-
tain anyo‘le or any nation which has
no desire to he sustained. oiir na—
tion seems currently m be just
such a nation, 'and it is not diffi—
cult to see what direction it is go-
ing. For this reason the American
government has every right, eyenthe
duty to do as it has now done. The
Senate had no intentions of denying
anyone of us the title of ‘American,’
but rather is responding tothe real—
ization that there will he no Amer-
ica for all of us red-blooded Amer-
icans, including Mr. Youno, if sum

Pickard, Zwelling: Defend

To The Editors:

This letter is in response to Ms.
Sylvia A. Cate’s “blast”of the He.
alth Center. It seems fairly obvious
(to us) that, knowing Sa‘ncone is
on duty 24 hours a day in the Health
Cent r, there might be some easy
means other than “through an R.A.’s
phone call to'thc place claiming
an emergency” or kicking “in that
big glass door," to attract the nu-
se’s attention. Two such innume—
mmon in today’s society, of gaining
entrance into locked buildings are
knocking on the door in question and
ringing the doorbell. The doorbell,
located on the left-hands‘lde of “that
big glass door,” is loud enough to
wake the dead, let alone amiss
the mere attention of the nurse on
duty. Once aroused, we are certain,
(min prior experiences, that ANY
of the {our nurses employed at the
Health Center would have given
Mi. Cate exactly what she needed.
