Tom Goetz was the offensive star in the Knox
game as he topped the 1,000syard mark [or the
season, the first time that a Grinnell runner has
ever gained 1,000 yards rushing in one season. With
192 yards in 34 carries against the Siwashers Goetz
gained 1,019 for the Season. This broke the record of
978 yards set in 1969 by Washington Alston.

Goetz‘s fellow co-captain Jim Casey hauled in five
receptions, one oi them a touchdown,to hreak two
records he set the previous week. He caught nine
touchdowns for the year, breaking Mike Schwartz's
1957 mark by two. He also caughthis 56th pass oi the
year, breaking the old mark oi it set by Jim Pirolli
in 1969

Crane loads attack

Under gray and cold skies Knox opened the
scoring in the iirst quarter, but with ll '58
remaining in the second stanza treshrnan quai‘r
terback Paul Crane tossed an Bayard TD pass to
Casey, Crane iaked the kick and ran it in, giving
Grinncll all 877 lead. Casey’s catch was an over the
shoulder job, eluding two Knox defenders

Crane must be given a lot of err-(lit for the job that
lll‘, has done this year. As 1! freshman he has (lune a
tine job of leading an oiiensc that never really got
moving last year. Crane always attracted a loyal
audience, as his parents nnd other lricnds from
Council Bluffs. la. oiten came to see him play.

it was not '(il the fourth quarter that Grinnell
scored again. This time it was Crane. showing no
aversion towards running, going into the end zone
himseli tor a tworyard TD. then passing to Goetz to
give Grinnell 3 1677 lead.

Knox scored quickly on a pass but Grinilell struck
back [or its final score with 3:37 left in the game.
Mark Bowman, a freshman, who with Goetz, will
provide a strong running attack again next year,
ran in with a six-yard touchdown which, with Randy
Reavis‘ extra point kick. gave Grinnell a 23713 win.

Dciensivc Hunt
The Grinnell deiense played its tinest game or the

year, covering both the pass and the run. Mike
Harris, Hosea Engram, Dave Chroust, Greg Smith,
and Mike Vuper made tip the deienslve secondary
which gathered in two interceptions, one each by
Harris and Climust, Bob Grant, Lorne Robinson.
Paul Mateekl, Doug Cummings, Dennis Walters,

Bob Donelan, Mark Blanchard. Mike Darragh
made up the remainder oi a deiensive corps which

Let‘s not lorget the rest oi the oiiense Steve
MacNamara. Mike Nadlsky, Ba de Rosa, Grant,
Matccki, and Dave wopatopened up holes in Knox’s
line tor Goetz, Bowman, and Crane.
