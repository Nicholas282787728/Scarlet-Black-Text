Manning To Give Spring Address

Bayless A. Manning and Iowa
Gov. Robert D. Ray will give
the principle addresses at

. commencement and the alumni

convocation. respectively, [h’
is spring.

Gov. Ray's June 5 speechwill
commemorate the college's
and the state’s lZSth annivere
saries, both ofwhichare being
observed this year.

Manning will replace Kurt
Vonnegut at commencement
May 28 as Vonnegut‘s doctor
has ordered him to cut back
on speaking enggements.

Manning resigned last fallas
Dean of the Stanford Univer
sity Law School at the age of
48 because "it's time for a
younger man to take over."
During his six year tenure as
dean, he increased the faculty
by one half, attracted some of
the finest young legal scholr
are and headed a $10.5 million
fund drive for a new school,
research funds and more pres
fessors. Several new degree
programs were begun under
his leadership.

Manning recently served on
the President‘s Commission
on Campus Unrest.

Other persons slated to re
ceive honorary degrees at
commencement ceremonies
include Andrew Billingsley, a
black Grinnell graduate (1951)
who is an assistant chancellor
of the University ofCalifornia
at Berkeley for minority gr-
oup programs, Randall Mor-
gan Sr., 3 black civil rights
advocate who has served as a

Faculty Executive Council Debate Continues

(continued from page 1)

greater role (especially‘i'n the

divisions), that the equili-
brium between the vested in-
terests of the departments and
the broader viewpoints oflar~
ger groups was maintainedand
that the number of faculty
meetings potentially can be
reduced.

Leggett agreed with the in
put of students on the Commit-
tee on Educational Policy and
at the divisional level, alth-
ough he feared that studentin-
put might be too great under
the EC plan.

His only major point of dis-
agreement is that he feels that
the EC would be overworked
under the plan, since he feels
it is overworked now and the
plan adds responsibilities. He
recommended that theEChave
oversight over the budget, but
not that it serve as the Budget
Priorities Planning Commit-
tee.

His second disagreementwas
that he felt the Faculty Or-
ganization Committee should
have at least one extra at»
Large faculty member to bring
the coal membership to four.

. Also he felt the chairman she
ould be other than the chair
man of the ﬁlCuItV.

roilowing Leggett's speech,
William Valentine, instructor
in sociology, moved that the
section providingfordivision-

nl executive committees be

deleted. He argued that that
level was tomlly unnecessary.

Debate on that amendment
proceeded for about 15 min-
utes until Gregory Guroff,as-
sistant professor of history,
successfully moved that the
faculty convene as a Commit-
tee of the Whole to discuss
the general thrust of the pro-
posal.

Clotfelter spoke oftwo major
needs of the EC whicharemet
by this proposal in response
to Guroff's questioning. They
are, according to Clotfelter,

that the ECVshould know about

the budget to protect’faculty "

interests and that the EC sh-
ould delegate primary inter*
viewing authority to some
other group since the ECdoes
not have enough time for that
responsibility.

Dean of Administration Wale
do Walker told the faculty of
his long- felt conviction that
the budget is too complimted
and too time-consuming for a
body such as the EC to have
control of it. He asked the
three members of the admin—
istration~appointed Budget
Priorities Planning Commit-
tee--Victor Verrette, Robert
Voertman and Gene Wubbelsv ~
to speak to the topic, and they
all expressed general support
for his position. \

Voertman expressed his be-
lief that the committee could
and should report frequently
to the EC to keep it up to date
on budget planning. After the
meeting, Clotfelter agreed
that such reporting wouldsat-
isfy the basic sentimentwhich
prompted the recommendation
in the EC plan.

Greg Butcher, editor of the
58:13, commented that at
Carleton College budget de-

cisions are madebya Students

Voertman «expressed a great
deal of surprise at that state-
ment, but Dean Joseph Wall
revealed that he also knew of
Chrleton's structure.

Butcher also questioned the
duplimtion of function he saw
between the EC and the EPC
under the plan. He felt that the
duplication increasedthework
unnecessarily and expressed
his belief that the duplication
was countenanced because of
a “groundless" fear of stud—
ents at the uppermost level
of decision-making.

He argued that a wiser split
of function would call for an
all»faculty Personnel Com-
mittee and a studentrfaculty
EPC.

Other general objections to
the plan were expressed by
Arnold Adelberg who com-
mented that the plan approa ch-
ed the right problemsbutproe
vided the wrong answers and
by John Morris, who contends
ed that the plan would over—
work department chairmen
and would not enable younger
department members to share
in the work and the decision-
making.
