' Prof. Gale Recalls Long Career

by Toby Wosk and
Nancy Wilson

Mr. Grant 0. Gale took his
position as a Grinnell physics
teacher as a temporary job.
That was in 1928.

After 43 years as one of
Grinncll's mostbelovedprofs,
Mr. Gale is retiring from the
faculty. His teaching experi»
ence, however, has not been
limited to Grinnell College.

A Fulbright lectureship took
him to Baghdad for a year in
1954, to Karachi, Pakistan in
1963, and to Ethiopia in 1969.
His teaching career also in»
cludes summers as a physics
instructor in India and Japan.

Mr. Gale finds teaching in
these developing nations an
experience parallel to teach
ing at Grinnell in (hC 1930’s,
when students were vocations
ally motivated.

During the 1930's, Grinnell
was hit as hard as any other
institution by the Depression.
To cut down on food costs,Mr.
Gale recalls, students cultir
vated produce for the food
service right on campus. An
asparagus patch was loomed
where the health center is
today, Mrt Gale nored. He and
the rest of the faculty gave up

25% of their salaries to put
into the scholarship fund dur
ing those hard times. The
school accepted one student's
father's meteorite collection
(now on display in the science
building) as barter for her
education.

In those days Grinnellpoli‘
cies could definitely be labeled
"male chauvinist." Girls
were net allowed to smoke, for
instance, while men were air
lowed to only off campus. Men
had no hours to keep, while
girls had very stringent ones.
Should a student not abide by
the rules, he could get "aim-
pussed" -~ confined to his
room.

“Chapel was held every
day," said Mr. Gale, and one
was ”expected” to goa certain
number of times a week. Men
sat on the north side of the
chapel, women on the south.
The Department of Applied
Christianity wasanactivepart
of the college at the time,
under the supervision of Dr.
Steiner, a Jewish immigrant
turned Congregational minr
islet.

Dr. Steiner was one of the
many people responsible for
the “pacifist" image Grinnell

Yearbook Might Ride Again

Wednesday night thirteen
students attended a meetingin
A.R.H. to discuss the possi-
bility of resuming publication
of the Grinnell yearbook.

The major topicofdiscussion
was money. Many suggestions
were made as to how to get
funds and how to economize.

Several types of inexpensive
bindings were suggested. One
method is to have large pages
containing complete informer
tion about a subject put into
boxes and distributcd‘in that
way. Each page would be ins

“new wamran: Sincere
gentleman seeks runninge
mare. Caucasian preferred,

dependent of the other, thus
eliminating binding costs.
Other possibilities include
having three-ringed binding
and plastic covers.

Funds for theyearbookwould
probably come from theS.G.A.
fund or the Alumni office.

But, more than money, the
yearbook needs student help
if it is to succeed. The
thirteen people who attended
the meeting are not enough
and S.G.A. President Shelley
Floyd who presided over the
meeting said to urge anyone
interested in helping to come
to her.

The yearbook is wide open
for suggestions since it has
not been published in three
years. All the staff positions
are unfilled at this time.
Those interested in working
on a yearbook should come to
room 11 of the A.R.H. building
at 10:00 Wednesday, October
20.

had during the 'ZU's and'au‘s.
The pacifist movement didnot
take the form of loud student
protest, but was more ofa
movement of basic anti-war
sentiment on the part of the
whole college community.
This movement wasa reaction
both to the fascist movements
that were an aftermath of
World War I and to Hitler's
growing power. International
relations conferences were
held frequently, in which the
topic would be: how to keep
from getting into another war.

Only 17 boys attended Grin-
nell during the war-all either
4, P's or pre-meds. An Army
unit occupied the empty
dorms, and Mr. Gale recalls
the soldiers drilling on the
football field and marching to
class in formation. (“Class"
consisted of a language school
set up on campus.)

Grinnell offeredapilot train-
ing program in those days. One
night practical jokers disr
sembled a practice plane on
display in Goodriow basement
piece by piece, reassembling
it on the steps of Carnegie
(the library at that time).
When asked the next morning
how he thought the airplane
might have gotten there, Mr.
Gale, ”a Physics professor
and therefore well-versed in
such subjects," according to
the SSiB, was paraphrased as
saying “Theairplane couldnot
have gotten over to the library
by itself."

Hiring representatives ap*
proached Grinnell science
staff members during the war,
offering them work on a mys»
terious job called the Man-
hatten Project. They were
told nothing except that they
would be working on the most
powerful device ofdestructiou
the world had ever known, the
weapon that would wipe out
Hiroshima.

Having been a part of the
Griatieii :ommunityforlonger
than any other faculty mem-
ber, Mr. Gale has obviously
witnessed incredible changes.
Someday he hopes to share
his wealth of Grinnell experi-
ence in a book which could
approach encyclopedic pro-
portions.

Mark H. Sokolsky, Inc.

by Ann Cassel
It all started in 1967 when
he bought some stock. That
was the first step of Mark
Sokolsky’s transformation
from college student into cor»
poration. What is nowMark H.
Sokolsky Incorporated was

once a mild- mannered college

student.

In 1967, Mark invested in the
stock market and made a pro*
fit. Realizing that he could
make money just by making
good investments, he decided
to continue Stockmarkctlranr
sactions. There was one small
problem in his plans, though:
his status as a minor made it
impossible for him to do such
things as sell short or arbir
trarge (which means to equal-
ize prices of equivalent se-
curities selling at different
prices in the same or dif-
ferent markets.)

Beinga minoralsomade
getting loans difficult. Since
Mark really wanted to getinto
the finance game, he had to
find some way to get around
his status as a minor.

In 1969, when hcwasafreshe
man at Grinnell, he decided to
form his own corporation.
Even though Mark himselfasa
minor could not do all he de-
sired in the stock market, a
corporation could—therefore
MHS Industries, Inc., was
formed in order to allow him

to enter into legal contract.
At first Mark was the only
stockholder but later began to
sell stock. He even formed two

subsidiaries, one being MHS
Foods and the otherbeingMHS
Investment Corporation.

In March of 1971 he did what
he calls “turning himself into
a corporation.” How‘does' one
turn himself intoa corpor‘
ation? Well, [the Mark H.
Sokolsky Corporation took
over all Mark's personal
assets and liabilities. Hepur-
chased MHS Investment Core
poration from MHS Industries,
and MHS Foods was dissolved.

The only way Mark can obs
taln money for personal
spending from the corporation
is to issue himself a salary.
This has all been done through
proper channels and Mark is
officially a corporation. Ifyou
find the above narrative mind
boggling, you are not the only
one; Markmentionedthntmost
people who hear the preceding
story can'tbelieveit--andthis
reporter is no exception!

He emphasized the fact that
the money made was not the
main motivation, but that the
learning experience and the
feeling of satisfaction gained
through matching his mind
with the experts are the pri
with the experts are the pri-
mary reasons for his business
dealings.
