WELLFORD ‘mmpagel

hire prolessionals, especially law-
yers,to present their interests inan
effective way. There are now some
50 of these lawyers now so employed
and Mr. Wellford predicts the for»
matioll of many more ofthesegroups
in several states. These groups are
initially helped in organizational
matters by his own group but after
that are on their own.

And finally there are Specific pub—
lic interest action groups which are
dependent on certain constituencies
for their support, “There is no end
to possible constituencies such as
these,” according to Mrl Welliord.

Mr, Wellford was quick toacknow-
ledge that there will probably never
be a large number ol people inter
ested in working for public interest
groups such as his. As an alterna-
tive, however, he would like to see
a rumor reform in the various pro-
fessions. This reform would be a
kind of “ethics union" so that pros
iessionals, especially scientists,
would not be lorced by the govern—
ment of big corporations which em»
ploy them to break their own code
of ethics. The pnysicist's first duty
is to his field, Wellford explained.

when asked if the need for such
independent groups as his was an
indictment against similar governe
mental agencies, Mr. Wellford re-
plied that to some extent this was
true, but that as a result of close
scrutiny many governmental agen—
cies are attempting to clean them-
selves up. He also noted thatsever-
al of the men working for such
agencies were formally of his group.
This he sees as a good sign,

As far as specific jobs for college
students Mr. Wellford told of aneed
lor 700 people to examine every
district in the country to see how
amenable the representatives of
those districts are to reform and
also to teach his group better how to
persuade them. Those interested
should write to:

Robert Fellmeth
Box 19367
Washington, Dc. 20036

He also revealed plans for a mas-
sive study ol every aspect of Con-
gress to take place in 1971—72. Many
professionals, especially in the
fields ol law, economics and polir
tical science will be neededforthat.

He explained however that if the
choice comes down to a graduate of
college and one of graduate school,
he must take themorehighlytrained

applicant.

The history of what is now the Cenr
ter for Responsive Law in brief is
as follows. The organization was
started in 1966 by Ralph Nader as
his personal stall. For the next lew
years 1243 people came to work
every summer. This however proved
ineffectual and the attempt was made
to start an institution of some sort.
A $55,000 grant from the Carnegie
Foundation was instrumental in
making this a reality. The institu»
tinn was called the Center for ReSA
ponsive Law. Its staff of full-time
workers has increased from 5 to 37
and has 2400 people working part-
time,

In one of his final remarks Wellford
emphasized that there is nothing to
prevent anyone from forming a group
such as his. He cited the case ofsuch
a group formed in New Mexico which
has had great success in melasttwo

years. _
In the same evening he presenteda

formal lecture in Roberts Theater
which is to be televised by IEBN,
Iowa’s Public Service television net»
work.

He began with some relerences to
the names his group has beengiven,
such as the “salvage men of the
capitalistic system.” Interspersed
with humorous anecdotes, his leg,
ture brought out in greater detail
most of the same points that he had
made in the afternoon, He cited many
more statistics to back up his opin-
ions.

He explained in turn that the five
main concerns of his organization
are:

1) environmental protection

2) lood saiety

3) product salety

4) financial institutions

5) large corporations

He complained strongly ot'the “ad-
vocacy gap” which he described as
the gross imbalance in legal re-
presentation in favor of wealthy
clients and against the public in»
terest. He would also like to see
certain tax relorms so that big
businesses such as Purina, Dow,
Campbell's etc would be discour-
aged from swallowing up the family
farmers.

Mr. Wellford, born in Texas and
educated in the South and the East,
has devoted most of his career to
the study, action, and publication
of his life interest, which is The
Public Interest Movement. He is
currently a candidate for a Ph.D
in government lrom Harvard Uni»
versity.

College Admissuons
National 'Scrumble For Students’

by Ann Cassel

Private colleges with high academ-
ic standing, such as Grinnell, are
lacing real financial danger. Applir
cations for private, high cost Cole
leges throughout the United States
are decreasing while the number of
applications for many public institu—
tions is rising.

Several factors seem to have con-
tributed to the dropin applications to
private colleges besides theobvious
economic depression. Despite the
reasons, admissions departmentsoi
private colleges allpverthe country
must seek out and encourage stu-
dents to apply to their respective
colleges.

One contributing factor to the ap-
parent drop in interest in private

colleges is the emergence clhonors
programs at state universities which
can give the studenthigh quality edu-
cation at cheaper prices than small

private colleges. According to Nick
Ryan, director of admissions at
Grinnell, one of the small college
advantages which has been empha-
sized in the past by admissions
offices is the small classroom situ-
ation and how students can find simi-
lar situations in public institutions.
Parents and students are realizing
that high quality education can be
gained with less strain on the pocket
book.

There seems also to be a trend
among high school seniors tobedisr
enchanted with the idea ol going to
college. The usefulness of a liberal
arts degree is underquestionamong
many students, even by those already
attending a private liberal arts in-
stituticn. The moneyproblem enters
here again. it may seem to high
school seniors and theirparents that
$4000 is a little too much to spend

THREE LEVELS OF SHOPS

John Keeble’s 'Giunt Crub’

by Connie Tuck

Mysticism and music combine to
form the basis for the novel Crab
Canon written by Grlnuell English
professor Mr. John Keeble. Theidea
for the book originated from the
author's musical background and his
obsession with the musical cannon
which involves the repetition of one
theme by several different instrur
ments at the same time. Although
Mr. Keeble abandoned the original
idea because in his words, “It was
too mechanical," he kept the title,
and the idea of a giant crab because
they appealed to him,

The plot centers about a young man
in search of his father, drifts into
fantasy, and becomes apocalyptic in
its message. it ranges in history
from the syndicate in Boston to the
present world ol the sixties.

Eleven different characters tell the
story through their experiences with
the hero’s father, who isperhaps the
most interesting character ofall. An
almost literal devil, the hero’s
lather is practically ageless. He

represents or is an agent lor an uni
known demonic lorce who destroys

November 29 to December 22. The

The program is an adaptation of the

many Midwestern colleges.

CARLETON

The Carleton College Council last
week approved a proposal to add to
the staff ol the Carleton HealthSerr
vice a partitime gynecologist. The
services, which are supposed to cost
the college 33000 during the next few
months, are specificallyforthepurr
pose at providing Carleton students
with better medical service re
garding birth control, pregnancy
complicatlons, etc. The college is
not taking a stand, the Council em»
phasized, "on birth control, pre-
marital sex, or someotherallegedly
immoral practice."

uary of this year, and according to
its author, is doing a little better
than average in sales for a first
novel, Mr, Keeble explained, “First
novels are almost always flops, but
l don't necessarily want myworks to
become bestsellers. An author
writes what he feels needs to be
written, not necessarily what he
wants to say, but what heleels needs
to be said "

It took three years to write Crab
Canon and Mr. Keeble admits that
the writing is stylistically heavy.
He stated however that he has gotten
favorable comments on his work
from both teachers and students.

“No one has approached me with a
negative attitude, yet," he added
Jukingly.

Having been a prof at Grinnell for
three years, Mr. keeble is present»
ly dividing his time between teach-
ing and writing his next two novels,
Three Outlaws and Snake Oil which
are in his words “less flamboyant
and heavy in style than Crab
Canon.”

If either of the two novels repre-
sentsan extension of Mr. Keeble’s
style in his first novel, he may well
have a bestseller on his hands.

Bruce Gibson, editor at the Coe
Cosmos, said in a NovemberlZedie
torial that “there is little justifica-
tion for a student newspaper" at
Coe, simply because “little happens
on this campus (that is) worth re—
porting ” The student body pays
about $9000 a year to have the
Cosmos published, he noted, and
“with $9000, the student body could
hire atfirst - rate rock group."
The student body would probably
enjoy the latter more than a college
newspaper, he contends.

A Grinnell Airport?

plans are underway to promote an "improved airport” by the Grinnell
Airport promotion Commission (car),

The present lacillty, “a piece ol pasture lenced off and leased,” is “de-
finitely inadequate," said Dr. Larry Houser, chairman oi the commission. '
“Grinneil is the largest nonrmetropoliian community in Iowa that does not
have an airport with a surface runway," he continued.

Dr. Houser icels the airport is necessary if Grihncll wants to remain
competitive in attracting new industry. The majority of companies scouting
tor possible locations consider transportation lacilities as much as other

lactors, he said

If the Commission's plans are successful, the airport would be utilized
by general aviation aircraft. This excludes commercially scheduled flights,
For the college, the airport means charter flights for students, parents

and alumni.

presently the commission is working on the finalized plan for the proposed
airport, Dr, Houser hopes the report can be presented to the city council

by April 1, I972,
