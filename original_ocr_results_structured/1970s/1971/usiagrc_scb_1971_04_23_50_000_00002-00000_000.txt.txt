Stash Reprint: Marihuana Research Incomplete

Among the main difficulties
encountered in marihuana re-
search are those ofdosageand
mode ofadministration. There
exist several routes ofadmin-
istration including oral(sm-
oking or ingestion) as well as
injection. The problem isalso
complicated by the matter of
effectively determining the
potency (i.e., THC content) of
the dose sample. Many re"
searchers feel that a "reler
vant" study could not be at
tained without having the sub-
jects smoke the drug, as this
is the popular mode of con-
suming marihuana. at least in
the Western world. However,
should the researcher decide
to have the subjects smoke the
crude plant he then, if he is to
couduct a well controlled
study, must surmount the ob-
stacle of selectingan effective
placebo. This is extremely
difficult, particularly when the
subjects employed are exper-

I.’ ienced marihuana users. The
idiowledgeable user of maria
huana is attuned to, andmain-
tains, certain expectations of
the drug's effects. The alter-
native might be to use “naive"
subjects in the study. How?
ever, with smoked cannabis,
there isa technique in the self*
administration of the drugwh-
ich must be utilized to atmin
a “high" or drugged state.

The above is a sampling of
the overt difﬁculties confront-
ing the researcher contempla—
ting a marihuana researchpr‘
oject. Perhaps the primary
area of nearly barren infor
mation is that of perceptual
effects of marihuana. This
situation is perpetuated by
the apparent inability to ob—
‘je‘ctively measure perceptual
responses, that is, the de-
pendence of researchers to
rely on reports by the sub
jects. Research in the area of
perception is particularly im~
portant at this time, With the
imminent widespread availae
bility of marihuana a know—
ledge of the perceptual effects
of the drug would be especial?
1y critical in formulating ef~
fective legal controls upon
its use. This article reviews
the research to date on per
ception as inﬂuenced by the
drug marihuana and includes
some speculatory thought up
on possible directions for fir
ture investigation.

Visual Perception

Visual Perception: The most
comprehensive study ofmari—
huana and its effects conduc-
ted to date was commissioned
by the Mayor of New York
City, Fiorello LaGuardia, in
the early 1940's. A section of
the study devoted to psychOk
og-ical aspects included an ex
amination of the drug's pere
ceptual effects. The ability of
thirty-six “users" and eight-
een nonrusers to estimate lens
gth was tested both before and
after ingestion of 5 cc. of
marihuana. Postrdrug méas
ures revealedno deterioration
in the subjects’ abilities to
estimate length or draw lines
of a prescribed length. Two
years following the publica~
tion of the LaGuardia Report,
Williams et al observed that
estimates of the variable line
portion of the Muller-Lycr
Illusion Test were effected by
ad libitum smoking of mari-
huana on the part of six sub-
jects. Two recent experiments
evaluated visual acuity, onc
administering the crude plant
by smoking and the other em-
ploying three oral dose levels
of a marihuana extract, have

been reported in the litera-
ture. The former study em,
ploycd a test group composed
of ten experienced marihuana
smokers and a control group.
Both groups were evaluated
on a pre-drug test (smoking
of alfalfa) designed to match
the intensity of a variable

. light to one of the standard

setting. The experimental grs
cup was again testedfollowing
administration of 300 mg. of
marihuana cigaretteswhen the
subjects indicated they had
attained a subjective “high.”

No significant differences be-
tween prerdrug and post-drug
testing or between the testand
control groups were observed.
Clark & Nakashima in pilot
studies, however, observed
significant decrements in per‘
formance on depth perception
tests following administration
of capsules of marihuana ex*
tract (0.0125, 0.02 and 0.03
g1n./lb.). Their study also
investigated the duration of
the Archimedes Spiral After-
image. Marihuana induced a
shortening of the duration of
the after-image, whereas, the
determination of the end point
by control subjects was quite
variable.

Audio Perception

Audial Perception: Experi-
ments designedtoevaluateau-
dial perception may be group-
ed into two divisions, musical
and nonsmusical. Non-musi—
cal tests have primarily in
volved the discrimination of
tone pairs or thresholddeter-
mination. Evaluations ofaural
response were also made in
studies mentioned previously.
Clark & Nakashima found that
accuracy of perception of au-
ditory frequencies was un—
changed at all dose levels ad
ministered. Caldwell et al.
measurcd three threshold lee
vels: a) auditory threshold
determination , a signal tone
of constant duration and free
quency was attenuated until
the subject could no longer
detect the signal; b) tone
amplitude differential thresh-
old - subjects compared tone
pairs and were asked to indi*
cate whether the latter tone
was “louder." ”equal" or
”quieter" than the first; c)
tone frequency differentialth‘
reshold , similar to b). An
increase for the tone amplir
tude differential threshold in
the sccond test session was
observed among the mari~
huana smokers when come
pared to the controls. How?
ever, no significant different
ces were seen in the other
tests administered. Morrow
evaluated both nonrmusical
and musical ability by means
of the Galton Whistle Tcstand
the Kwalwasser—Dykcma Mu-
sic Tcsts. Little or no drug
effect was observed by res-
ponses to these tests.

Shortly after Morrow’s work
Aldrich (1) evaluated twel've
subjects for musical capabil‘
ities by employing the Sea-
shore Test followingadminisr
tration of 60 mg. of pyralicxyl
compound (a synthetic marir
huana derivative). The test

‘requires the differentiation of

pairs of notes, or pairs ofa
series of notes, in terms of
pitch, loudness, rhythm, time
timbre and total mcmory.Two
pro-drug trials were given
followed by a third trial 4 1/2
hours after administration of
pyrahexyl. Test pcrforman'
cos improved followtngthe SC,
cond non-drug trial, but re-
ltlrli"" ' '[‘p"'l‘<lm:tlt'ly the
original IL‘VCI following drug

administration. The only exi,
ception was a negligiblealter-
ation from second to third tri~
als in the area of rhythm.
When queried, 8 of the 12 be“
lieved that their performance
had improved in the drugged
condition. This subjective
feeling, however, wasnot subs
stantiated by the objective tes»
ting. Two years later Williams
et al. confirmchldricli’s fine
dings with subjects who
smoked marihuana as opposed
to the original study in which
the synthetic compound was
employed. Individuals intoxi-
cated with marihuana often
report either an enhancement
in their appreciation of music
or in their ability to perform,
where as research to datehas
either indicated no improve-
ment or a decline in musical
perception or performance.
Winick in an interview study
of jazz musicians reported
that although the marihuana
using musician l'nlghisubjecl’
ively feel thathis performance
was improved this might not
necessarily be corroborated‘
by his fellow "straight" mus
sicians. Similar delusionswe- .
re also witnessed bybothAld-

rich and Williams et al. in,
their studies.

Implications

Practical Implications - Dri-‘

ving: Possibly the most critir
cal problem facing a society
confronted with an increasing
proliferation ofmarihuana us-
age is the drug’s effect on drie
ving performance. In a study
previously described, Morrow
also measured hand and foot
reaction times for both 2 cc.
and 5 cc. dose quantities. Sim~
ple hand and foot reaction
times were unaffected by the
drug in both users and non-
users. Measures of complex

reaction times however, indie ,

cated impairment after the 5
cc. dose in experienced users
of marihuana. At fourth'hour
comparisons drugged subjects
demonstrated a 20% increase
in complex hand reaction time
and an 18% increaseincoms
plex foot reaction time. None
users were seriously affected
at both 2 cc. and 5 cc. doses
in measurements of complex
hand and foot reaction times.

erator errors, signal errors
and total errors. Experienced
smokers were given 1.7 gm.
of crude cannabis (smoked),
enough alcohol to effect a 0.01
blood alcohol reading on a
breathalyzer or no treatment.
Marihuana induced a signifir
cantly greater amount of sp-
eedometer reading errors,
while alcohol had detrimental
effects in all areas of driving
activity. Numerous profes*
sionals have criticized the
methodology employed by this
study. Consequently, any ex-
trapolation from the data in
the Crancer et al. study to
a description of actualdriving
performance is tenuous.

Research

Research A Some Suggest»
ions: It would seem vinally
important that a firm under
standing of the perceptual as?
pects of marihuana be devel-
oped. Further and more come
prehensive research projects
should be undertaken to study
the extent to which marihuana
produces decrements in per
oeptual performance as well
as the occurrence of marir
hlianaeinduced adverse per-
ceptual phenomena. For ex*
ample, Keeler (9) reports six
cases in which subjects ex-
perienced visual distortions
(imagery, hallucinations) af-
ter smoking marihuana. The
self—administered dose was
from 13 cigarettes. Keeler
also suggests that the emer-
gence of this phenomenonmay
be dose- dependent.

Problems

As discussed earlier, there
are many hindrances to con-
ducting research with mari»
huana. This situation is aug»
mented by the nearly uniform
and predominantly negative
results in the studies descri-
bed. It might be speculated
that this smte of affairs has

In spring.

arisen because of the insenr
sitivity of the testinstruments
employed in these studies.
Perhaps a more objective
route, a pharmacological one,
might be m‘ken to lend more
specificity to future research ,
on perception as affected by ,
marihuana. It has been indi-
cated in studies by Dagirman-
ijan Kt Boyd that THC has a
predominantly adrenergic ef-
fect. Dinnerstein has suggest
ed that an individual's ratioof
adrenergic to cholinergic
activity in part influences the
degree of fieldrdependence.
The author offers the hyper
thesis that marihuana induces
a field»dependent smte. Psy-
chologically, marihuana ins

duces losses in the areas of
quantitative reasoning, come

plex reaction time, analytic
ability and other cognitive-
perceptual skills associated
with fieldedependence. This
adrenergic-cholinergic ratio
may be reduced by increasing
cholinergic activity with drugs
(i.e. tranquilizers) or by eat'
ing. An increase in the desire
to consume food during mari-

huana intoxication has often'

been implimted in the lay or

"folk” literature. This might
be a physiological response
to regain homeostasis. A.
greater understanding of the
phenomena associated with
field-dependence can only be
derived through more inten—
sive and definitive study of
the mode and site of action of
marihuana and its constituent
compounds.

American society must come
to grips with the fact that,
whether or not it will legalize
or condone the use of marir
huana, a segment of its popur
lation will continue to employ
the drug as an intoxicant. It
would therefore seem imper~
ative that an understanding of
the perceptual effects ofma ri-
huana and their ramifications
be attained.
