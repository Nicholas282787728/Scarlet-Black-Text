Stora Kopparberg means
Great Copper Mountain in SwV
edish. In Falun, it has meant
prosperty and commercial
success for over 1000 years.
Today it means 13,000 jobs,
a commercial turn-over of
Ski two thousandmlllionyear-
ly, and the production of well
over one million tons of ore
annually.

Towards the end of the Vie
king Age between 850 and
1100 AD" the Great Copper
Mountain at Falun began to
be prized for its rich ore
deposits. In 1288, eight bisr
hops and the King notarized
a stock transaction involvmg
one eighth of the mountain.
This is the oldestknown docu*
ment concerning a Swedish
mine. In 1347 King Maguus
chartered the company supert
vising the extraction, marking
the birth of Stora Kopparberg
Bergslags AB.

During the seventeenth cen—
ttiry, the Falun mine was larr
gely the base on which Swe-
den built an expansive andexV
pensive foreign policy. Begin'
ning with her entry into the
Thirty Years‘ War, Sweden
enjoyed about fifty years as
a “great" European power.
The copper of Stora, which
at times accounted for two~
thirds of the world's produc-
tion, provided much of the
wpital which financed this
rise.

Until the late 1600's, most
of the mining was done by
hand. The most prevalent met
thnd of extraction was firing:
great cords of firewood were
hauled into the mine and Star
cked against the walls. When
set afire, theyheated the rock,
making it brittle‘and easy to
break off with simple tools.
Bundled into buckets, it was
hauled as much as 680 feet
to the surface by draught ani-
mals or men.

Urge Pressure For Women Profs ‘

by Beth Dichter
and Peggy Miller

Discrimination apinst wo-
men by Grinnell College can
be clearly seen by examining
the number of women on the
faculty. There are 15 women
faculty members, but most of
them are at the lower end of
the faculty hierarchy. There
are 43 full professors but one
ly three are women. One out
of IS associate professors is
a woman, and there are three
women among 38 assistant
professors. The rest of the
women are instructors (five
of 19), and both assistants
are women. The remaining
woman is a lecturer in music.
The physical education den
partment traditionally hires
women, and when this depart-
ment is not included, there is
only one womanassociatepro-
fessor and only two women
assistant professors.
Although there are fewer won
men than men wtth advanced
degrees, women are not her
ing hired in proportion to the
number of women who are
qualified. According to "The
Statistical Abstract of the U
nitcd States," 66,307 women
received masters or doctor-
ates in [968 and 133,934 men
received thesc degrees. In
certain divisions there are
more qualified women than
men. In [968, there were 5,7
204 women who received up-
per level degrees in English
and literature, and only 4,3[4

As the copper ore began to
give out in the late 18th ccnr
tury, other goodies took pre-
cedence. Today iron pyrite is
the m’JSI important product on
a tonnage basis, with copper,
zinc, and lead trailing behind.

The raw copper, zinc and
lead are generally sold to
other companies. Presumably
the volume of these secondary
products does not justify the
maintenance of smclting or
forging esrablishments in the
Stora empire. Foraswe shall
see, Stora is an empire, and
there is little that goes to
waste within it.

The iron pyrite, for instance,
is first used to make sulphu-
ric acid, in a Stora factory.
The iron-rich remains of this
process are recycledrralso in
Stora plarItS’ﬂomake ironand
steel. Stora‘s role in the steel
and iron industry was inaugw
rated with the purchase of a
mine in 170.). Bit its develop
ment in thisarea was retarded
until the nineteenth century,
when restriCtive legislation
regarding iron mines and fou-
ndries was repealed. By the
mid-1800’s, however, Stora
was operating some sixty
mines. Over the years this
has been whittled down to a
healthy handful producing one
million tons of ore each year.

Loath to see the labor of
their mines ultimately pron
fit someone else, Stora began
buying up steel plants and iron
foundries earnestly in the
middle of the nineteenth cen-
tury. They now own several,
including Sweden’s largest
steel mill, the DomnarvetSte-
el works in Eorlange, l7 kit
lometers from the head of-
fice here.

Because the copper mine
needed great quantities of
wood fort-construction, firing
and smelting, Stora was for
ced to buy lots of it. A penny
saved is a penny earned:
Stora “reserved the forests
of Nathan Dalaina for the

men who received degrees in
these fields. There areno WO’
men in the Grinnell English
department, and one woman
is teaching humanities. There
were 3,297 qualified women
in the foreign languages in
1968 and 2,778 men in this
field. but at Grinnell, only
three of 1-} members of the
foreign language departments
are women.

The College must change its
policy noz only to give equal
opportunity to women, butalso
to benefit students and faculr
ty. Women students should
have faculty advisors who can
counsel them concerning the
problems women face in grads
uatc schools and in profesr
sions. Men and women stu-
dents should have the oppor
tunity to relate to women in
a role that is traditionally
assigned to men to help over
come prejudices. Faculty me-
mbers shouldhave women colt
leagues to help them view won
men as equals.

The Women majors of each
department should organize in
order to see that women arc
hired in that department, They
should demand that a woman
be considered for the next
opening and hired if she is
qualified. Write to graduate
schools and ask for recom—
mcndations if the department
members are reluctant to do
so. The departmental level is
one where women can unite
and insist on having a voice in
the hiring offacultymembors.

needs of the mine." No doubt
recognizing the great debt they
owed the company, looalspa‘id
their taxes in the form ofdeli-
vcries of wood and charcoal to
the mine.

Stora now owns 964,000acres
of forest. Since coal and€l€C*
tricity have supplanted wood
as sources of energy in most
industrial processcs, Stora
now operates a large assort'
ment of lumber and paper
mills to keep the forests sol-
vent.

By the by, as it acquired
land, Stora found itself the
absentee landlord of some
17,000 acres of productive
farmland. They are modern
Sweden's largest singlefarmc
ing enterprise.

Finally, to cut down costs
on electricity, Stora built its
own hydroelectric plants. It
produces 2500 million kilor
watt hours a year, a lot of
which gets sold to other come
panics.

Stora’s literature is glossy,
colorful, and arrogant. It bli-
thely congratulates the com-
pany on maintaining so many
"industrial monuments" uni
der the auspices of the Falun
Copper Mine Foundation, but
the same brochures diSCI‘CEI’
ly refrain from mentioning
how many of Stora’s grimey

disastrous (EVE’IInS that oc-
curred at the Falun Mine in

Mime Troupe

The Grinnell College Mime
Troupe, which gave its first
performance during the m0,
dern dance concert last
March, is presently working
on the scenario for a longer
placenta melodrama-etc be
performed later in the semes*
tcr. »\s yet no date has been
set.

Director of the troupe, Bets
[y Voertman of the Theatre
department, was asked to be
a guest lecturer at high scho»
ols within a fixed radius from
Grinnell. Rather than present
just a lecture, she \vill bring
with her the pantomime group
and a small dance group.

Last spring the mime troupc
gave its first outside perforr
mancc at Grinnell HighSchool.
The six members are: David
Gaines, Greg Crimes, Steve
LaRocque, Tom Simpson, Pam

Where Will You Be Vohng?

by Greg Vranicar

Although all present estimates of the effect of the 18‘year-
old vote are tentative, it is not, I believe, too early to con»
sider some of the ramifications of the TWGHIY'SIth Amends
ment. Many political analysts. (from barbershop to profes—
sional) believe that the youth vote will make little difference.
They argue that next year's 18721 year-olds will go to the
polls in just about the some numbers as the traditionally
highly non‘voting 21-30 age group. Some people have even
been heard to remark that older and generally more coir
servative veters, fearing a sizable turnout of young people,
will vote in higher percentages than ever before and thus
offset any highly organized attempts at youth voting power.

Richard Turner

The size of the studcnt vote, especially in a city like Grins
nell, will depend on the final decision concerning college
student voting-Can students vete in the city in which they
go to school? This issue has already erupted in Iowa. In
midrsurnmer, arch-conservative Attorney General Richard
Turner stated that, according to his interpretation of the law,
college students should not be allowed to vote in college towns

unless they were

"born and raised” in that town. Turner's

opinion was immediately challenged by many people across

the state,

most notably the veter registration officials from

Iowa City, Ames, and Cedar Falls, the three cities with the
largest population of college students. The registrars said
they were going to go ahead and register college students
no matter what Turner said. There was no segment of the
voting law, they argued, that stipulated anything more than
residency of six months in the state, 60 days in the county,

and 10 days in the precinct.

Legislature

It appears now that Out‘Of-State students in college towns
who fulfill Iowa residency requirements will be allowed to

vote. The qualifier

"now" is important, however. There

is no doubt that a proposal will be introduced very early in

the next

session of the Iowa Legislature to limit college

town voting. The bill will have a good chance ofapproval.
Informed sources have indicated that by late last spring
the sponsor of the measure had lined up nearly all the necese
sary votes to pass such a law in the predominantly Repub—
lican legislature. If such a law is adopted, it will be challenged «
in the courts. However, will the court case confuse students
so thoroughly that many students will decide not to go to

the polls? Or will

delays in resolution of the issue act so

as to deny students their voting right? All Iowa college

students should keep up to date on these developments so
that if lobbying or other action is needed, we will know the

issues.

Denial In Home State

In the next six months or until the law changes, college Stur
dents other than freshmen and transfers who want to vote
in Grinnell can do so. Each v0ter must simply signa state
ment saying that he or she fulfills the residency requirement
of six months in Iowa and 60 days in Poweshiek County.

whether or not they want to vote here, Although laws vary
from state to state, it seems to be a general policy that you
may vote, if you are a college Student, in either your college
town or at your permanent residence. But you cannOt let
gally vote in both places. For example, if you decide to vote
in Grinnell this fall, you are in effect declaring thatas of
the day you vote yotl fulfill the Iowa residency law. In order
to vote later in your home state, according, of course, to
various residency statutes, you must wait until you retest
tablish residency there. It would be possible, then, after
voting in Grinnell to decide that you want to vote at home and
be legally denied the vote because you fail to satisfy the home

state requirements.

in Iowa, each student's decision on where he or she Wants

in a presidential primary, he should vate in his home state
since Iowa has no primary. If there is not a Senate race in
your state and you want to veto in Iowa’s Senate race, you

the college student voting question is resolved,
