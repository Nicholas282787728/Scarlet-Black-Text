Gregory Challenges
“Cowboy Mealalily’

(continued from page 1)

years ago'"

On Women’s Lib:
are human beings first
women second.”

On violence as a solution to
social injustice: “If violence
was the answer to the prob?
lent, America’s so violent,
we could’ve straightened out
the entire world."

Gregory ended his commen-
tary with a halfrhour mono-
logue on the ”cowboy mentar
lity” of white Americans and
concluded that students had
become the ”new Niggers and
now InjllnS””[I'le new scape-
goats of a society that felt it
had to destroy to prove its
virilityl

”You have the allrimportant
job of returning sanity to an
insane society," he finished.
“The . l thing you young
folks have that scares us old
folks is your moral force."

Dick Gregory posed in those
two sentences both a formid-
able challenge andaformid-
able threat to young people.
Through exertion of their
moral force,youthcanrestore
sanity to a sick society or
they can sit back and be con-
tent to be the new Niggers
and Injuns.

He’s hoping they have had
enough of the ”cowboy men?
tality."

THE SCARLET AND BLACK

Val Gray Ward Players Perform

by Celestine Bloomfield
Martyr's Weekend was high*
lighted by three beautiful and
Black drama productions.
C.B.S. presented its talented
members in a production en-
titled Young, Giftedand Black.
The dynamic Sister Val Gray
Ward gave a stunning perfor-
mance Sunday in Herrick Cha-
pel. Later that Sunday, Karen
mu, a Black theatre group
from Cleveland, Ohio, gave
its heavy presentation of The
Lion Writes.

The audience was clearly
moved as Sister Val Gray
Ward gave her stirring rent
dition of James Weldon John-
son's The Creation. Thoughts
of that old time religion bee
gan to cross the minds of
many people who had finally
come to the conclusion that
God was indeed dead, and the
chapel was filled with emo-
tions that they had forgotten
about and ceased to use. Sevp
eral people were moved to
tears as Sister Val Gray
Ward filled the audience’s
heart and mind with the drama
of Harriet Tubman, which in-
cidently was written by her
husband. Later that afternoon
she attended a session at the
Black Cultural Center. Her
parting words were "You are
Black first, last and always.”
Sister Val is truly a
woman of her Black convic-

Bla ck -

tions.

Karamu presented the many
aspects of Black writers in a
fast~paced, hard hitting form
of satire and reality. Contem’
porary as well as the older
Black poets' works are pre»
sented. Karamu held an ans~
wer and question session at
the house. When director Earl
Billings was asked if soul was
confined to Black people and
not to white, he answered,
“One day this nation's soul
shall be Black and America
shall cease to be its name.”

The brothers and the sisters
in C.B.S. put togethera super-
bad show with readings, at play,
dance andmusic. Theprogram
began withsome powerful poe-
try readings. Selections from
the works of Sister Sonia Sane
chez, Brother Diggs and Bro-
ther Don L. Lee were read by
C.E.S. members M. 01bit, C.
Bloomfield, j. Gray and H.
Day. The readings were fol?
lowed by a creative dance to
the music Young, Gifted and
Black of Nina Simone. The
dance was choreographed by
Sister L. Copeland with the
help of her fellow dancers M.
Price, S. Scullock, R. Weldon
and F. Gray. Next, an adapt‘
ation of Sonia Sanchez's one-
act, Sister Son/jiwaspresent~
ed by D. Jones, G. Moore, P.
Swansey and C. Bloomfield.

the message some over good
and strong at the finish. The
C. 8.5. presentation wasended
by the together music of the
Mother F. The highlight of
the evening was their rendir
tion of Hannibal. As the song
began in a slow quiet tempo
utwo brothers walked down the
aisles thru the crowds whis-
pering, "Hannibal is coming."
And Hannibal came. In con-
clusion I would like to say,
"The brothers was do/en they

all, for the cause, they was
do/en they thang together."

Cleage Tells Stages OI Revolt

”There are stages of revo-
lution," said Rev. Albert B.
Cleage in his Black Martyrs’
Weekend lecture on “The St—
ructure of Society. "First,
you cry out. Then you hit at
the nearest point ofirriiation.
From there you define who
the enemy is. Then you work
on a program to meet the kind
of oppression that enemy pre-
sents."

“Dr. Martin Luther Kingne—
ver did have a program. He
was always on the ﬁrst step
of revoluti0n*--protest, sc-
reaming."

"I think Dr. Kingmadea sig‘
nifitnnt contribution to the
struggle but I disagreed with
him all the way."

Cleage, who is pastor of the
Church of the Black Madonna
in Detroit, used the examples
of Jesus Christ, Dr. Martin
Luther King, Malcolm X, and
Lt. William Galley to reveal
the structure of American so-
ciety as he sees it today.

”Jesus’ ministry was not
based on universal love', ”
Cleage maintained,‘ as many

ministers would have you be-
lieve jesus was arevolutlon-
ary- —a threat to society. He
was continually running away
from assasination. When Je<
sus was destroyed, it was a
social destruction. He was
martyred because he threat—
ened the society. It' s an early
example of a society coming
down on someone."

Cleage, who has written a
book entitled "The Black
Messiah," interprets the
Bible and the life of Jesus
Christ in strictly “black and
white" terms. "Jesus was
bent upon freeing his people
-»-the black nation," says
Rev. Cleage.

He observed that Malcolm
X was far advanced over Dr.
King in terms of program
because Malcolm was “deal-
ing with defining the enemy
--»white people. 'f
Cleage pointed to the Galley
(rise as a clear example of
American white supremecy,
which he sees as thereal
structure of American soc-
iety.

Mosely Sees 'Black Awareness’

In a brief refocusing on the
racial crisis in AmerimyPro-
fessor Charles Mosely of Chip
cage State College called for
a greater "institutional aw-
areness" of blacks in Amerr
ica. Mosely restated the view
that blacks should continue to
move toward control of their
own communities and pointed
out a number of examples of
progress in this area.

Speaking at the opening con»
vocation for the Third Annual
Black Martyrs' Weekendva
program which commemor-
ates the assasination of civil
rights leader, Dr. Martin
Luther King-~Mosely spoke to
the theme of “Black Martyr-
dom in America"

"There are basically five
alternatives to the present
American system," Mosely
said. “Political, ideological,
land, economic and arms."

He noted that many Blacks
are going into an ideological
change in terms of pan-Afri‘
can awareness. He further
noted a marked increase in
a feeling of oneness among
blacks with their African bro-
thers.

Mosely emphasized the vali~
dity and need for black pride
today and noted attempts be-
ing made in Chicago to use
the familiar cultural backgr-
ound and experiences ofchild-
ran in black communities to
help improve their reading
motivation. He cited a pre-
school reader being consider-
ed for use in the Chicago
school system which employs
the vernacular most familiar
to the kids, regardless ofgra-
mmatical accuracy or possir
ble “offensivness”. Therea-
der, called ”A Ghetto Pri-
mer," deals with a realistic
view of life in the black com-
munity and attempts to instill
a certain amount of cultural
pride in the young children.

Grinnell students voted 374
to 211 Wednesday noon to keep
cigarette machines on campus
despite health and ecology
considerations; at the same
time they voted 382 to 77 to
accept the amended judicial
council section of the Consti-
tution as drawn up by the stu-
dent Senate early in the fall.
