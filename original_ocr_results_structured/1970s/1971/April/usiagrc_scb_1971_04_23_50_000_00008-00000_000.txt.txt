Victory Moves Netmen To 2-3

The Grinnell tennis lCJl“ put
its record of 2 3 this past
week by losing to UNI 6-3,
but bouncing back to defeat
Cornell 7-2. Previously winr
less Carlos Mendoza and Pete
Doering borh came to life to
manage the only singles vicr
tories against the UNI squad.
Ken Schofield, Jim Spell, and
Bruce Bonnewzlll all forced
their matches into three sets,
but each came out on the lost
ing end. In the doubles, the
Pioneers managed to win two
of the three matches when UNI
quit and left for Oskaloosa
after their :2 and :3 teams
split sets with the Grilillcll
duos.

Against the wcakt-r Cornell
team, however, the Crinnell-
lans hatl much better luck.
Erad Vazales led the way by
winning both of the rl singICS
position and at the doubles
with Carlos Mendoza in a
hard fought 3 set match. Jim
Spell also won a thriller in

Golfers Finish 17th In UNI Meet

The Pioneer Golf team {01*
lowed in the brilliant tradi-
tion of freshman footballand
varsity wrestling the past
weekend by finishing 17th in
the istteam University of
Northern Iowa Invitational
Tournament and losing badly
to Carleton, St. Olaf, and Knox
in Northfield.

Simply outclassed at UNI
over the two-day meet by
such teams as Iowa State,
Drake, and UNI, Grinnell’s
golfers lacked depth needed in
the third and fourth positions

to move up in the standings.
Skip Tredway continued to
play well as number one man
with a 75 Friday, tying him
for 5th place overall but
faded slightly to a 79 on Sat—
urday. Senior Bill Chown
was low for Grinnell Saturday
with a fine 75. Gary Johnson
and Al Schoene were the third

very little went well for the
Pioneers Monday as they were
shut out by Carleton 1570 and
lost to St. Olaf 13-2 and Cor»
nell, who Grinnell had tied
earlier this year, 12 1/2»
2 1/2. Tredway was the only
Grinnellian to break 80, fol*
lowed by Chown, Schoenc, Jet

lmson, and Mike Burkle. Sch-

winning the intra-squad
“skins” game with the aid of
a few handimp strokes anda

Still hopeful for a respect

Pioneers take on Knox, Mon-

Black/ White Relations Analyzed

time, at least as is known by
the SGA cabinet or by the Dean
of Students Office or by the
5&B.

Another problem aired atthe
meeting was that of noise.
Black students in Younker
tended to see the conflict as
one of black and white life-
styles. However, that seems
a rather spurious argument,
since it is a conflict that is
present on almost every floor
on campus. Any attempts to
make that problem intoa ran
cial one merely make it im*
possible to solve.

The noise problem is anothr
er one that, like the linetculr
ing and pool problems, can
only be solved by peer pres-
sure. Quier hours have been
or can be established in every
hall; even without quiet hours,
normal respect is always
cal18d for.

The 8&8 ran an article im-
mediately following the black
prespectives weekend in which
Charles Guy, admissions cou-
nselor, dealt openly with the

problems caused by thntwcek-
end.

He had arrived at the cause
of the problem (poor recruit
ment and screening by theagr
encies Grinnell worked With)
and was prepared to solve the
problem for next year (by do
ing more personal recruiting
anti by working more closely
with the agency).

The only seemingly substan»
tive problem mentioned ill the
letter was that of the reign
tlonship between white pro-
fessors teaching blacktorlcnt
ted courses antl the blocks in
those courses. That problem
will be examined in depth in
next week’s S& B.

The problem of daytto-day
black/white relations is com-
plicated by a phenomenon that
is peculiar to the Grlnncll
campus. This phenomenon prr
esents itself in the hall desr
truction problem, the theft
problem (including S\G\,the
bookstore and the library),
Ilnet cutting and dayatordnv
hall and campus livmg situa-
tions.

person who confronts another

for Violating some rule or re-

ring \vithanOther’s life style.”

l\s a result of the assertive
ness of those Grinnellians who
tend to violate regulationsand
others’ rights and the deten-
siveness of [I1630CU$€I‘,GIIII’
nellians have ceased to con»
from anyone.

Hall judicial councils and the
campus judicial council have
fallen into disuse; students
will let every member of a
hall (including themselves)
contribute to repair damage
even when they know who did
it.

Students feel helpless to qu»
let a noisy room; they will
gt) to the library or the lounge
to study, or miss their sleep,
rather than ask someone to
quiet down.

Students constantly hear of
violations, thefts, cheats,etc.,
without even considering the
pus ibility of reporting them.
Everyone on campus is aware
of what their general reputa-
tion would be if they were knr
own to have reportedsomcone
for a minor m' deed.

Because of tlils attitude, Gr-
innellians in general are failt
ing in interpersonal relations;
is it any wonder that, with the
added problems, they arealso
falling in black’white rela*
tions?
