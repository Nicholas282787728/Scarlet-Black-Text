Dinner time at one of the Grinnell cerop houses.

S&B Examines Co-ops

(Editor’s note: The coeop house is
new to the Grlnhell campus this year.
This is the time when housing decisions
about next year must be begun; Dean
Tederman is scheduled to report on the
Cheap houses to tile Trustees when they
meet during the midsemester break.
The ruture housing scene is about to
be determined, so an stills reporter has
attempted to analyze the coeopprogram.)

by Don Homolka

What is me like in the coeops and what
are the ieelings oi tlle students who live
there? This reporter round many simi-
larities, but each co ropdifieredirom the
others.

The students wanted toiom ior basically
the same reasons to get out oithedorms
and to iind an alternative to Saga. But it
was emphasized in one cmop that these
should not be the only reasons

One must want to live in a co-operative
situation and accept the joys and pitialls
inherent in such a system.

Overall, there was a good reeling in
the coeops The students prererredthem
to his in the dorms. and they were gen-
erally enthusiastic about them, They
were more a part or their lives than
just a place to live To be more than

just a place to lIVE,'m01‘e work and"

etiorton the. part,oi the 'students‘was
needed, But the returns seemed to be
well worth it,

The rood is cheaper (and thought to
be better), the his style iar superior.
and a reeling oi reality in relation to
the outside world was much more evie
dent than in the dorms.

There was, however, one aspect oi
the wraps that was somewhat negative,
a ieeling oi isolation irom the campus
was apparent in varying degrees. iso-
lation depended on the student, but the
tact that the carop resident does not
meet people in the dining halls was the
basic reason tor the reeling otsepuratea
ness.

One or the most important points about
the coeops was that so much depended
upon the individual makevup oithe coeop.
The chemistry must be there to make it
work. The better the make-up,thebetter

the work goes, and the better the entire
situation, The wool) could easily become
an unpleasant experience cithemenibers
began to rail out and conilicts arose

Conversely, if everyone is really 107
gether, the coop is a iantastic experie
ence

What impressed me most about the
enrolls was the reeling oi community
among the members. As an entering
ireshman, the one thing that struck me
most about the campus was the lack or
community The cerops have succeeded
in attaining a level oi interaction iar
superior to that in the halls Mitch or
this comes irom the ract that they are
working together, eating together, and
living in a house ttiat provides a ramily
atmosphere,

lt is in this aspect oi the means that is
so important to the college Though the
Comps can be expanded, they will not
take in a large portion oi the students.
An average or twelve students live in
each co-op Consequently, it people on
this campus wantin some wayto simulate
the co-ops to a certain extentinthe halls,
they must act now.

Personally, i found the COVODS ah excite
,ing and real experience, and l ivouldlike
to ‘see some semblance of them put into
the halls. However, it is impossible, phy-
sically, to recreate the Co-opsystem in
"re halls.

This is why the students, it theywishm
make an eiiort, must work now AsDean
Tederman stated, ‘ he students must
take the initiative'

The co-op program is worth looking at

and expanding simply ior its beneiit to
the college. Though building problems
will arise--Conoco House is ting ior
showers--overall the Cerop program
seems to be worth expanding,

vacancies due to semester leaves will

allow tor a law campus students to join
the wraps. And next year a possible ex;
pansion oi the program will allow ior
more students to participate. The
question is whether the dorms will im-
prove ior those who remain.

”Human Sexuality" was the subject or

cral speakers at the conierence
questioned traditional roles and values
surrounding sexuality in our society.

nnsclma Dell’OllU, a New York iemi»
nist, maintained that the recent liberar
izing oi sexual mores has failed to meet
women's true needs, and advocated a
major social revolution as the only ei~
rective solution to women's problems
Several presentations on homosexuality
attempted to create a situation in which
gay women and men could pi‘ojecl ti
positive, natural image or themselves
as human beings, thereby breaking down
damaging stereotypes and prejudices

Women’s studies was the topic oia
speech by Dr Ruth Benson, a Wesleyan
University protessor who is currently
working with one oi several women’s
studies programs which exist in various
parts oi the country. Dr Benson ielt
that the subjects dealt with so tar at
Wesleyan have created a dynamlcclasSa

Bazoomied Barry

by wily Waldo

it is not uncommon ior Chuck Berry's
listeners to appreciate the master
without thinking about him. There is,
perhaps, something lntheBerry char
ma which resists anything not strictly
visceral Another reason tor the lack or
intelligent study oi Berry is the general
reiusal oi American Academia to cone
sider seriously the popular art iorms
The invective and pcurile prose which
can be round regularly in the Journal oi
Popular Culture are examples or this
reiusal

But even iairly serious eiiorts, such
as Colin’s Rock irom the Beginning,
tend to dismiss Berry with peripheral
characterizations the prototype oi the
sixteen year old hustler, cruising ior
burgers in an eternal '55 Chevy Without
dcnying the essential validity oi this
characterization (In Berry, the essence
is the suriace), and without bothering to
argue whether Berry is aware or the
subtleties oi his art, i should like to
present two characteristics oi Berry’s
work which argue convincingly in iavor
oi listening to Berry rather than reading
RobberGrillet or pondering the rate or

sic example oi this relationship is iound
in “School Days.” in this song, the
“melody" or the mideiiities white
sclilock is replaced by a series or
rhythmic patterns. The guitar is used
in a percussive sense, and the voice

in addition, the subject matter oi the

roll) is reilected clearly in the guitar

The second major characteristic oi
Berry’s work can be described in acar
demic terms astheclosure oitheaesthee
