My rcn ion to Harold Wile
lens‘ re Uri concerning the
election in South Vietnam can
best he described as one of
apathetic Interest. ’l‘lIere is
liltli‘ that is startling about
Saigon politics after so many“
years‘of futility.-

Harold Willens‘ preoccupar
tion with our involvement in '
Sililii‘ti‘asi Asia begin in 1965
when he became one of the
first members of the business
community to speak out pubs
licly against the war. After
becoming acquainted with
Congressman Pete McClosky,
Willens was invited on a fact
finding mission to Vietnam.

A fter spending several mon-
ths there, Willens became
convinced that any attempt at
conducting a democraticelec-
tion would be futile. lie was
especially frustrated by U.S.
ambassador Ellsworth Bun-
ker’s personal assurances .
that Vietnam was achieving
great progress in attaining
stability. Upon learning about
this attitude, Willens rolated,
Vietnamese would habitually
break into hysterical laughter
and point out that over 100,000
politiml prisoners were our ‘
rently being detained .
Thus, Willens is convinced
that although brute force has
thus far succeeded in main-
taining some appearance of
tranquility, a potential erup-
tion of violence is assured.
Thieu’s recent order of 'shoot
to kill' in an effort to stem-
the political dissidence re-
veals that the ruling clique is
well aware of the situation.
Willcns, who had an oppor-

‘ tunity to spend sometime with
both Ky and Minh, was able to
offer an Interestingtnsightiw

are granted all traditional
procedures of job application,
including filing of a completed
application form, requestsfor
. transcripts and letters of re-
commendation, and a profes
sional (not personal) inter-
_vlew. Alleged departmental
refusal to do so should be ad
, judicated.
‘(5)‘ Consider hiring faculty
wives who are skilled in_a
specific area to serve in an
dvisory capacity. Such wo-
en would function as sourr
‘1 cos of reference for both stu~
dents and faculty and would
receive status and salary in
return for the privilege of
.chSullﬂtiDn with them.
' (6) Consider hiring qualir
-fied faculty wives to direct
independent studies. While
the. male faculty is frequenb
1y overburdened with indepen-
dent studies added to their
full- time course loads, many
faculty wives have not only
the time‘to properly direct
' such studies, but the requisite
skills and desire to do so.
(7) Create more part time

. new courses appropriate to '
those skills could be consi-
dered. Similarly, the latitude -
allowed male teachers hired to
teach subjects outside. their
area of specialization should

(3) Eliminate the insidious
effects of the prevalent pre>
judice toward nepotism; ,"an .
unwritten nepodsm i'ule is I
.mIIch harder to fight than a
written one." (Harris, “The
Second Sex in Academe' ).
Since theadminStration, due to
a lack of policy, is currently
powerless to prevent lndlvi<
“duals and departments from
discriminating against faculty
wives on thebasis ofnepotism, '
the college should take an of-
ficlal written stand' 'against”
such discrimination and
should adjudicate any alleged
nstances of it.

period.

The faculty then considered
Mr. Guroff's proposals, the
sixth proposal first. The
original proposal would have
required the budget committee
to' notify department chairman
and individual faculty mem-
bers of the salary recommen~

ldations made in their cases.

It was ammended so only de-
partment chairmen would be
informed.

Departmental chairmen co-
ul'd determine whether their
'advice has been followed; such
feedback was considered imr
portant and the motionpassed.

The meeting then adjourned.

Mr. Gale' 5 motion to change
the commencement of spring‘
break from. noon Saturday,
11 March to 4 PM Friday,
it] March was removed from
the table. After a discussion
lasting almost fifteen minutes,
the faculty v0ted n0t to change
the calendar.

Discussion had just begun
on item 1 when Mr. Worley
explained that he intended to
call a quorum before any fur-
ther votes were taken, so he
felt he should call for a quo-
rum then. As a quorum was
no longer present, the meeting
abruptly adjourned.

(8) Pro- rate job fringe ben-
efits for part- time employees
in exchange for a pro rated
schedule of extra- curricular
responsibilities. Job security
should be provided in contract
for-long~term part-time em-
ployees.

(9) Increase opportunities
for independent work. All
college courses not filled to
capacity should, whenever
possible, be opened to faculty
wives. All college facilities
should similarly be made an

' vaiiable to faculty women asa
matter of stated policy. Cases
of alleged departmental denial
of permission ‘to use college
facilities should be adjudicate
ted. The. college should fur»
ther attempt to effect an ar~
rangement with the nearest
university libraries which
would permit unemployed but

‘ academically involved faculty
wives to borrow books needed
for independent research.

(lo) Purposefully interview
all future male candidates for
1 Indimti'ons ' of' their wives'
. specific needs and ambitions.
When appropriate, arrange to
accommodate these needs Im-

mediately in the form of a
written committment; if ac-
commodation is impossible,
so notify the candidate “be-

,fore” he makes his decision
to refuse or accept the job
offer.
