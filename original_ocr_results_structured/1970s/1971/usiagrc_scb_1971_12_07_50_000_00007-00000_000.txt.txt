No Te‘sls Fit-3r Applicants?

by Ann Cassel

The admissions policy at Grinnell
has been a relatively hot issue this
year, compared with previous years.
The sudden interest in this aspect oi
college is caused by the proposal to
discontinue requirements ct SAT or
ACT scores for applicants. Accord-
ing to Nick Ryan, the students onthe
Admissions committee generally fa-
vor such a movebuttheproposal has
been tabled until further study could
be done.

Some reasons presented tor the re,
moval of the board score require-
ments include a possible Cultural
bias in such tests, the feeling among
high school students that too much
emphasis is placed on a three hour
test, and the last that a student may
tend to exclude himseli merely be
cause of board scores and fail to
apply to institutions to which he mah
be accepted.

The general feeling is that the pool
of applicants would inCrease ii the
requirement were abolished. The
admissions committee tabled the
idea because oi a lack oi eVldence.
A subcommittee was iormedto check
into the iacts oi the matter andpro-
duce sufficient evidence.

Magic Number 550

At present the standards for admis-
sion set up by the admissions com
mittee include the requirement of
either the SAT or ACT ( the ACT
was accepted last year) plus three
achievement tests, three recom-
mendations, and a personal inter—

Faculty Meeting

view. Each year the admissions
committee sets minimum standards
for admission which Can prove to
be fairly flexible. The admissions
oilicc can make a decision on any
applicant who is within the top 1/4
of his high school class and whose
board scores are above 550.

Those applicants falling below this

-range must be discussed and de-

cided upon by a faculty admissions
board consisting oi LaVern Dnrkee,
Peter Connelly, Neal Klausner and
Nick Ryan. In the event oi a tie
vote, Dean Waldo Walker acts as tie
breaker. ii the applicant scores
breaker. ii the applicant scores
above 650 on his SAT’S or has a
comparable score on the ACT, he
cannot be denied admission without
referral to this same board. The
admissions staft also takes the ap-
plicant's recommendations and the
personal interview into considera-
tion in order to, as Nick Ryan puts
it, “look at the total candidate”.
Suns Over Daughters?
Although applications to Grinnell
this year have increased slightly,
the number oi female applicants has
decreased. The reasons for this
trend can only be guessed at. Nick
Ryan hypothesizes that it could be
due, in part, to thepresentecononiic
squeeze. Parents may consider a
son’s education more important than
a daughters and so would be more
willing to spend the available money
on procuring a good education {or
their male prodigy.

Approve Admissions Board

in a two hour meeting Thursday
afternoon the faculty discussed and
approved a change in the procedure
to be lollowed by the college in hand
ling applications lor admission lrom
black students.

The changes had been recom
mended hy the Executive Council
which had based its decision on the
discussions that were held through
out the week with the CBS negotiar
ling committee.

Under the present system all applir
cations are read by Dean of Admis-
sions Nick Ryan. “All candidates
who rank in the top 1/4 oitlleir class
and who score above 600 (average)
on the SAT oi College Entrance EX-
aminatidn Board may be admitted
by the Dean oi Admissions."

Ryan is to “careiully investigate
cases in which the average SAT
score falls between 500 and 600 and
should consult the Admissions Board
it the case does not involve an ob—
vious admission or rejection.”

The Admissions Board must reVlew
those Cases “in which admission has
been recommended by the Dean
where the applicant does not rank in
the upper 1/4 oi his high school class
or whose SAT scores averagebelow
550 or whose recommendations are
qualified.”

Whenever an applicant has SAT
scored above 650 and the Dean re,
commends rejection, the lull Ade
missions Board is required to roe
view the decision. The Board may
also review any decision of the Dean
to reject an application, provided a
member of the Board has reviewed
the application and disagrees with
the Dean of Admissions.

Dean Ryan is the Chairman of the
Admissions Board and casts theder
ciding vote in Case of a tie vote on

any application decision.

The general guidelines remain the
same under the new system, but a
separate admissions hoard will be
set up to deal with applications from
black students.

Mr. Ryan will still read all incom»
ing applications, but he will forward
applications irom black students to
the black admissions counselor(Mr.
Hunt). Mr. Hunt will be authorized
to admit students who tail above the
600 SAT threshold_and are in the top
1/4 oi their class. He will send the
letters of acceptance to all black
students admitted.

in cases where the Admissions
Board would normally have to act,
the new Admissions Boardior Black
students would oonsidcrthe applica—
tions and make the decision.

The new board will be chaired by
the Black Admissions Counselor;
two other “representatives from the
black faculty and/or staff" will be
appointed by the Dean oi the College
to serve on the board. The Dean of
the College is to Consult with the
Chairman of the Faculty, the Chair-
man oi the Faculty Organization
Committee, the Chairman oi the
Admissions Committee, the Dean oi
Students, and the Black Admissions
Counselor and cos representatives.

Financial Aid deCisions tor stun
dents admitted by both boards will
be under the control oi the Dean oi
Student Financial Aid (Mr, Ryan),

Ryan predicts that the enrollment
in theialloi19’72 will be increased
by approximately 25 students, 35%
oi whom will be on iinancial aid.

New Propaganda

Although Grinnell doesn’t seem to
he experiencing the decrease in ap-
plicatiohs that many small private
colleges are, the admissions oilice
is working hard at presenting a
favorable image of Grinnell to per
spective students as demonstrated
in their new booklet, The Sharing a!
Grinnell. The Sharing or Grinnell,
printed on 100% reclaimed waste
paper, contains photographs of many
iacets oi Grinnell College lile
quotes trom students and prois and,
oi course, the usual, but lnthis case
lairly well written, propaganda.
Perhaps the most convincing and
surely ego-building for students oi
Grinnell College is q uote from
President Glenn Leggett: "What
makes one college better than an-
other is the style and quality at the
people who attend it, who are grad-
uated irom it, and who thus belong
to it, and in turn, possess it."

Isl Snow Battle

Academic pressure and snow don’t
mix; at least not without a ﬁght.

As nature was laying down a solt
blanket oi snow Sunday, some North
Campus residents were laying down
some plans of their Own. The result
was an hourelong. North Campus
South Campus snowball fightin front
of Read Hall. Over lOO students pars
ticipated in the battle.

Some 50 North Campus residents,
the majority lroin Clark Hall, chal-
ienged the students in Read Hall. At
10:30 am, Read Hall residents coun-
tered by dumping water on the people
issuing threats. Read Hall students
emptied three fire extinguishers full
of water in the effort to repel the
invaders.

North Campus and South Campus
later joined iorces and attacked
Norris Hall.
