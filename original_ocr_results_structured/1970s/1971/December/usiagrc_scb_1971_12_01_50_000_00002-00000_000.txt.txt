mg with a number oi breaks,

The administration and the black
negotiators “went down the list" or
the Black Maniiesto, according to
Dean walker.

The demands as stated in the
Black Maniiesto were modiiied with
in the iirst halt hours oidiscussions
Walker said,

The administration insisted that
blacks open up Burling library by
12:15.

Aiter blacks and administrators
reached agreement on iour oithe ten
issues oi the Maniiesto, an agreer
ment that there would be no punish»
ment oi blacks who participated in
taking over Burling, and an under—
standing that the results oi the dis—
cussions would be presented to the
Trustees then; blacks did leave the
building, at 12:30.

At that time, some 30 blacks were
counted walking out oiBurling. Many
oi the others had leit earlier.

Also, the administration agreed
that there would be no reprisals
against any oi the blacks involved
in the action or occupying Burling

According to Dean Walker, the tour
oi the ten demands which could be
decided by administrative action
were settled. other demands may
require approval or action oi the
iaculty or Trustees.

There was agreement, however,
that Mr. walker would talk to SAGA
iood service about iood options; that
no oiiicial meetings would be held on
campus discussing blacks in the
sense oi policy decisions without
black representation; that there
would be an alcove set up in the
library with books and materials oi
interest and importance to blacks;
and that improvements would be
made in the Black Cultural House.

The original demand regarding the
iood service was that blacks begiven
the right to decide whether or not
they will take any oi the board op-
tions.

This could not be decided by any oi
the administrators, but Dean Walker
did agree to talk to the Saga iood ser-
vice and try to makebetterarrange—
ments.

Reports in the Des Moines Register
Tuesday mornmg that it was agreed
that ”soul food” he served in the
college dining rooms were inaccur»
ate.

The only restriction in the agree-
ment that a black representative be
at every meeting discussing the sur—
vival oi black students is that they
would attend only meetingsdisCuSSr
mg policy.

Committee meeetings which con
sider the cases oiindividual students
such as meetings oi the Academic
Standing Committee, are normally
closed to all students and would re
main so.

If the Academic Standing Commits
tee or any committee normally
Closed because it discusses indivir
dual cases were to havediscussions
on a policy matter, it would then
admit a black representative, Mr.
Walker said.

The black library Will Consist of
books already in the library’s Colr
lection, but they will be put in a
Special location in Burling.

item number 10 oi the Black Manl-
iesto also asked that therebeauler
visual equipment in the black librae
ry Such equipment already exists in

Burling viewing room, and is largely
unused, so there will he no special
equipment in the black library sec-
tion

Dean Walker told the black negotir
ators Monday that there were no
larger oiircampus houses available
ior use as anewBlack Cultural Cenr
ter, but that improvements could he
made in the present building.

That building, at 1003 Tenth Aver
nue, has very poor kitchen equip
ment and Walkerwill try to makeime
provements in that (such as a new
retrigerator) right away.

other improvements may he made
in the Center irom materials that
Building and Grounds has in stock

Blacks and administrators also
reached an understanding that there
would be a settlement oi sorts by
Saturday, December 4.

CBS negotiator Lawrence Wright
told the sol; that Monday that the
black student body ielt that they
could in good conscience relinquish

the library because, along with the
agreement about Saturday and the
agreement that there be no reprir
sals, “Action upon iour oi the de
mands was initiated or met or
guaranteed."

walker and asked that three memr
bers oithe studentgovernmentexeCr

ment at the conclusion oi the meetr

Vandalism

Several serious acts oi vandalism
occurred on the campus lateMonday
night and early Tuesday morning,
The results included serious loss oi
telephone communications in the
residence halls and anumberoislov
gans written on campus walls.

There has traditionally been ahise
tory oi vandalism during times oi
campus crises, and evidently the
past iew days have been no exception
The vandals have notbeenidentiiied

Mr Ed lngraham, General Mana-
ger oi General Telephone and Elec—
tronics ioi- Crinnell, indicated that
almost all on campus residences
were without corridor telephone
service, More than loo telephones
had the transmitters removed irom
the handsets.

Since the transmitter does not nor»
mally break down, GTiiE did not have
an adequate supply oi the parts ior
immediate replacement The cost
and responsibility ior the damage
rests with the college, according to
lngraham.

Dean oi Administration Waldo Wal—
ker indicated that the cost might be
very high, Neither he nor lngraham
were able to provide a tirm tigure
yet, but indicated that in addition to
the cost oi the parts, there was the
cost oi having a telephone repair
crew tied up on the campus ior
three days.

until repairs were ettected, only
emergency calls, which were routed
through House presidents private
phones, were put through to stur
dents. Campus operators iniormed
other callers “A person or persons
has vandalized all hall phones, renr
dering them useless Until needed
parts are returned, the College is
powerless to eiiect repairs 1' Calls
to administrative oiiices, the For-
um, or the Class buildings were
not aiiccted by the damage

In addition to the loss oi thetl‘anSr
mitters, lngraham also reported
other minor damage to the college's
telephone system He did not think
that these repairs would be diiiicult
or time consuming.

The other mayor act oi vandalism
occurred when someone wrote sloe
gans on dormitory walls with indelr
ible magic marker. Typical was the
slogan “Black, Yellow, Red, White...
A Pig is a Pig is a Pig,” which
greeted early risers heading ior
breakiast in Cowles Dining Hall,
The oiiice oi Physical Plant Di—
rector Dale l-lawn indicated that it
would be several days beiore the
damage was tully assessed

Bits workers were severely hame
pered in their eiiorts to assess dam—
ages and carry out their work by the
loss oi telephone service

 

i TextOi Black Manifesto i

(Following is the text oi the Black
Manifesto.)

When in the course oihuman events,
it becomes necessary ior a people
who were stolen irom the lands oi
their Fathers, transported underthe
most ruthless and brutal circum-
stances 5,000 miles toastrange land
sold, into dehumanizing slavery,
emasculated, suhiugated, exploited
and discriminated against ior 351
years, to call, with iinality, a halt to
such indignities and genocidal prac-
tices ., by virtue oi the Laws oi
Nature and pi Nature’s God adecent
respect to the Opinions oi Mankind
requires that they should declare
their grievances and the urgent re.
dress thereoi.

We, the Black students on this cam—
pus, because oi the racist
atmosphere which prevails, demand
the following
1) we demand that this administra-
tion establish a Black community
with no less than 200 representatives
taken irom all walks oi liie oiBlack
people, and that the responsibility
ior the establishment or this com
munity be corshared by the present
Black Community;

2) a Black student on every Commit-
tee or council in the College, with
minority veto power over all things
that will iniluence the survival oi
Black people;

a) that no otticial meetings be held
discussing the survival oithe Blacks
on this campus, without the mandated

The Grim-tell Scarlet & Black

Black spokesman,
4) that we, as Black students, have
the ﬁnal say on the residence oi
Black ireshmen and sophomores;
5) because We feelthatthe SAGA iood
service does not serve the types oi
iood that are necessary to the sur-
vival oi Black people, we want the
right to decide whether or not We will
take any at the board options,
6) that all iinancial aid be reorgan—
lzed SO that it does meet the needs
of Blacks, including books and
travel, and to insure that this is
accomplished, we want Black stur
dents on the iinancial aid Committee
with veto power;
7) because of the enrollment and the
programs oi CBS, we ieel that the
present Cultural Center is insuiii-
cient, therefore we demand a house
large enough to accomodate the pmr
grams oi CBS;
8) the immediate institution of a
Black Studies malor, which is super
vised by Black students;
9) that Black students be given the
full administration of all tundsdeal-
ing with the survival ol Blacks;
10) the institution of a Black library
with all audiOrvlsual equipment that
will aid in the academic survival of
all Black students;
We [eel that iI these demands are
met, orinnell College may then be
conducive to the needs UI Blacks.

“Our paper system is almost use
less without the telephones” ex
plained Mrs. Betty Ashman, 59Crer
tary to Mr, liawn. "They can hear
our page, but Can't get to a phone to
answer it".

Wednesday morning Student Coor»
dinator Terry Clitiord attempted to
print a notice oi campus meetings
concerning the black students crisis
on the rnlmeogl‘zlph machine in Car
negte, only to iind that the iluideon-
tainer had been iilled with water, The
reiill cans were also iilled with
water

Terry then went to theScience Seer
retary’s Oiiice and was able to use
the machine there, although the reiill
cans tor that machine were also
iilled with water. Mr Pomerenck,
Business Manager, was notiiied and
was able toget the machines working
again later in the morning.

Grinnell House residents Russ Mce
Cregor and John Pieiier noticed
Wednesday morning that the “Grinr
nell College" sign on highway 6
outside the Fine Arts building had
been deiaced By noon the vandalism
was corrected

The letters in another “Grinnell
College” sign, outside Burling lie
brary, were darkened in with chair
coal; both acts oi vandalism took
place Tuesday night,

The Student Coordinator’s oiiice
said this morning that there did not
seem to be anydirect connection be
tween the vandalism and the black
students’ demands. “The tone oithe

‘NBC’ Reaction

Monday aiternoon the NBC Manyr
iesto appeared in students’ maile
boxes. it had been stutied by agroup
oi students who could not be identi—
iied ior the SiiB by mailroom super-
visor Ernie Renaud

Clearly a parody oithe Black Manir
iesto, the NBC Maniiesto opened with
a preamble: “when in the coarse
oi proto-homonids, it becomes
necessary ior an entire species who
were stolen irom times past, trans
ported under the most ruthless and
brutal circumcision over 20000
years and more than 11111 cubits toa
dehumanized piasticity,,

During the day posters were placed
in the entry oi the library, one oi
which contained a copy oi the NBC
Manyiesto and the iollowing inscripr
tion: “The above statement reilects
the typical white racist attitudes oi
Crinnell students and is a clear
example oi why black students ieel
the way they do about white students
here.“

The Manyiesto caused enough con-
cern among the house presidents to
prompt them to issue a statement
urging students to remain calm and
to “condemn actions, such as the
publication oi the 'NBC Manliest’,
that only tend to heighten” the ten-
sions that already exist on campus.

Possible Violation

The Black takeover oi Burling
Library Monday was in violation
oi several laws according to Grine
nell Police Chiei Bill Peters, he
added, however, that no action could
be taken without “a complainer".
in this case, President Leggett would
have to tile any complaint

Unlawiul assembly would be the
easiest charge to prove, Peters in-
dicated The charge could bebrought
either against all persons who were
involved in occupying the building,
or selectively against those who
were determined to have been the
leaders oi the takeover.

however, President Leggett has
promised CBS that there will be
no punishment ior Monday’s action.
