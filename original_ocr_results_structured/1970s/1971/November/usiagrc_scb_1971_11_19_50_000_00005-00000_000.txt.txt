Analyze Credit Fail Use

The results oi a computer analysis at last semester’s grades
show a iew interesting iacts about the way students are using

the credit tail (or) option,

The analysis showed that this year’s sophomores are using
credit tail more than the seniors. About 57% ot the seniors,

under the option; about 54% oithe sophomore class had already
taken more than tive hours, Seniors were here the semester the
college closed early when many more students than usual
elected some sort of credit fail option; the number of sopho-
mores who have taken credit iail courses probably reﬂects the
tact that many took required courses during first semester at
last year on the credit iail basis.

Students with different gradepoint averages did not appear to
use significantly different amounts. lnthe overeall studenthody,
about 24% of the students used more than 15 hours of cr. 9.7%
oi those in the range between 3.75 and 4.00 and 30% of those in
the range between 0.00 and 1.75 had used over l5 hours of CF.
The middle gradepoint ranges are well in accord with the

average.

Of the Seniors 1% had used no Credit fail—~a real accomplishs
ment, because participation in musical organizations and the
fulfillment of the old physical education requirement would have
given many people a tew credits. The ditterentopA categories
followed the trends of the class Very well, except at the ex-
tremes. About a fourth of the class had taken more than 20 CF
hours. The one student in the lowest GPA category, none of the
students in the top GPA category, and about a fourth of the
students in the middle had taken more than 20 hours. Thirty-
five percent of the juniors hadtakenmorethan 15 CF hours, of
these none of the students with top GPA’s, both of the students
with very low GPA’S, and almostexactly 35% of the students with
GPA’s in the middle ranges iell into this category.

The tendency in the sophomore class at the extremes was

i exactly the reverse of that inthe uthertwo classes. None of the
students with the lowest GPA’S, 60% of the students with the
highest GPA’s, and about 20% of the class as a whole had
taken more than 10 hours of CF.

The survey also analyzed the use oi credit fail by sex. 44% of
the senior men and 39% of the senior women had taken more
than 15 hours; 35% of the junior men and 34% of junior women
had taken more than 15 hours; 14% of the sophomore men and
25% of the sophomore women had received more than 10 CF

credits.

The computer also tigured out the average GPA of students
who took certain amounts of credit fail work. Average GPA for
the entire sample used was 2.921. Averages or students with
16-20 hours were: seniors, 2.845; juniors, 2.932, sophomores,

At any rate, three small group
projects have been partially funded
by the committee: (1) A group in-
terested in operating the computer
for various non-academic pursuits;
(2) A group known as the Ad Hoc
Tulip-Planting Committee inter
ested in beautifying campus grounds;
and (3) the Associated Jewish Stus
dents (AJS) organization's trip to
Des Moines for religious services.
Conditional to each expenditure was
that notice be given to the entire
student body.

The expenditure of $247.89 in the
field of social events was madepri-
marily at the beginning oi the year
in the financing of picnics. Biology
Chemistry, Anthropology, Spanish
and German majors all received
money for picnics. The Student
Recreation Association and the Col»
lege Choir also petitioned for and
received funds. Alpha Sigma Sigma
received partial funding for admis—
sion to two concerts with the specie
fication that there be allscampus
publicity.

Two major expenditures comingup
in the next few weeks will be for the
financing of end~ot-thevsemester
hall study breaks and for a donation
to the East Pakistani hunger relief
campaign. The total allocation for
hall study breaks will be about $200
to be apportioned on the basis of hall
population, The committee ieelsthat
this semester, more than ever be»
fore, hall study breaks willbe needed
during finals week.

The InitiativerCultural Fund has
decided to sponsor a Weekrlong, all,
college tunderaising drive to collect
money for the starving East Pﬂle‘
tani refugees in India. The com-
mittee will match by half the total
amount of money raised by the stu-
dents (up to a limit of $300 of Fund
moneys). in this way not only is a
fund-raising drive being held, but
from student response the Com-
mittee will have a sort of referen-
dum by which it can equitablydeter-
mine the proper donation. Perhaps
the nature of this expenditure is not
warranted under committee guide-
lines, but many people have exprese
sed their desire and willingness to
“deny ourselves in a small way so
others can eat." 1 hope you not only

understand my desire to structure
this type or donationeexpenditure in
a judicious manner, but inope you
can find it in your conscience (and
your pocketbook) to give “so that
others can eat."

Scolls Noted Researcher

by Snarf

“The word ’problem' ", writes
Borges, "may be an insidious
petitio principii. To speak of the
‘Jewish problem’ is to postulate
that Jews are a problem; it is to
predict (and recommend) persecu-
tion, plunder, shooting, beheading,
rape, and the reading of Dr. nosene
berg's prose.” A similar transfnr»
matmn of the merely verbal into the
dangerously real has occurred at
the University at Iowa, where large
scale rock concerts have been tem-
porarily banned.

The reasons given tor the ban in-
clude (predictably) fire hazard and
the potential for violence due to
heavy drug use--which are as char-
acteristic of Elk's conventions and
posteelection parties as they are of
rock concerts. This in spite of the
U of ’5 Campus Security Director‘s
expli t statement that crowds at
two rock concerts in question “did
not create any groupdisturbances.”
A more entertaining explanation of
the ban comes trom the (seemingly
ever»present) ”noted drug ree
searcher” on»thesspot, who re,
marks that much of the extroverted
behavior at concerts would be elim»
inated if crowds were smaller. This
“noted drug researcher’s’.’ objec»
tion to “extroverted behavior“ is
merely laughable itviewed as exem»
plary of the American intellectual’s
perennial inability to mind his own
business; but the issue is more ser-
ious when Such nosiness results in
restrictions on the behavior of 7000
rock freaks who would never think
of imposing their behavioral pat—
terns on a “noted drug researcher,”
Banning rock concerts is not, of
course, an unusual or ditticultactive
ity; any twasbit rural sheriff can do
it with impunity because censorship
of rock is as allsAmerican as ban-
ning The Naked Lunch or listening
to Perry Como. Every single one of
the self-appointed guardians 01
American banality has at one time or
another condemned rock: Frank
Sinatra, the John Birch Society, the
FCC. It is curious that of the two
most popular forms of music in
America today (rock anlelStringS

Good 'Prime lime' Concert

by Jay Southard

Being another in a series of “in,
side” (read “biased“) musical res
views.

Yes, Virginia, there was a concert
last weekend in Herrick Chapel, The
concert was noteworthy in that it
marked the tirst “primeetime” ap
pearance of a student chamber group
other than the official Collegium
Musicum and Grinnell Singers.
Those two official groups also made
their presence heard.

This reporter, however, quickly
tell down on the job, iorgetting that
he had one until the end of the first
pieces by the Collegium Musicum.
informed sources might also
disclose his close relationship with
two of the six members; too close
for him to be objective perhaps?
No comment.

Sam Adler (note) and William Cone
ner (harpsichord) played a Sonata
by Fredric the Great. Fredric was
a ﬂute player himseli and, as might
be expected, his piece is virtuosic
(read “flashy") Sam and William
played very well, which is anunder—
statement, but the great in Fredric
stands for his military expertise,
not his musical abilities, which is
also an understatement. Sam and
William performed an encore which
being more a scale and trill exera
cise on the llute than a piece, was,
I think, their own little joke on the
serious music Critic. i also cums
mend Sam and William for their
ability to keep nearly straight faces.

This quartet is the elite of Student
chamber musicians A semi-pror
fessional quality could be expected
or them, and indeed, several weeks

ago, in a student concert, the lirst
movement of this Haydn Quartethad
exactly that sound. Saturday’s per»
lcrmance was disappointing in that
respect (uniortunately). The second
and third movements were good,
however, and the macabre effect oi
the slow minuett was not lost.

The difficulty of the Haydn was
surpassed only by the quartet's
ambition, and matched bytheirabil-
ity and nervousness. Thefirstviolin
part abounds in virtuosic passages
(do not read "flashy” this time)and
Maura was understandably nervous.
David and Vicki were solidly com.
petent which was the besttheir parts
allowed them to be, and that solidity
was important and will be again it
the quartet continues to perform
(hint, hint). Kathy Kabrick is a Con—
stant source of delight. No, no, not
that way you lechers. Her pertore
mance was consistently superb
throughout the piece.

After all that heavy stuff and in—
tense musicianship, the Grinnell
Singers provided a reireshinglinale.
That is not to imply that their muss
sicianship was poor; on the contrary,
it was excellent. The Singers prnr

was,“ s. w
Ritchie Haven’s new album, The
Great Blind Degree has turned out
to be the Amchitka of the record
business. i never expected thatsuch
a great pertornier would turn out
such an incredible bombofanalbum,
it was amazing to me that a Havens
album would be so boring that I
would have trouble listening to the
whole side.
Muzak?

When Havens played at woodstock,
he had his guitar, a backup guitar,
and a conga percussion section. This
was also true of his early albums,
on his latest he has not only the
above, but also a fullrpiece orchesV
tra with an abundance of shrill
strings not to mention a Moog.
Havens’ distinctive rough voice and
his driving guitar is all but buried
in this onslaught of canned muzak.
And there is no one to blame except
Havens himself, for heproduced this
album on his own.

Havens does a sixsminute version
of Taylor's “Fire and Rain." It is
amazing how many instruments he
can put into this one cut to ruin it.
He takes this poignant song and
turns it into a lively dance number,
adding the usual strings and a harp
which keeps fading in and out or
the song in almost random fashion.
The song has a busy sound with far
too much going on at once to be able
to enjoy it.

Class B background

”Teach Your Children”, Graham
Nash's song, was so bad it was al—
most funny. it starts out with the
orchestra playing what sounds like
a cheap theme from a class 8 movie.
Then Havens finally comes in witha
mundane vocal which makes four
minutes sound like fifteen.

There are some nearvbright spots.
"in These Flames" is the only song
where the orchestra complements
Haven's vocals by playing noticeably
in the background. And Cat Stevens’
“Fathers and Sons” has no orches-
tra, but the song is far too long and
monotonous The album on the whole,
however, is no doubt Havens’ worst
effort to date and possibly One ofthe
worst albums I've heard all year. it
was high time tor a terrible album,
but it’s sad that such a fine perfor—
mer had to be responsible!

Pleasant Surprise

Just after Havens had depressed
me, I put on a record calledsimply,
Gilbert O’Sullivan, Himself. He’s
been getting a mild publicity push,
so I was curious to see what this
Irishman had to offer. What I found
was a pleasant surprise. It’s im-
possible to describe his style, ior
there’s a little of everything from
dixieland to rock on this album. But
all the music is happy, and much or
his lyrics are genuinally witty, and
you can't help but liking O’Sullivan,
who looks like a Character straight
out of Joyce's "The Dubliners"

“January Gil” is his firstolferiilg,

honored tootsteps oi Simon and Gar~
funkel in expressing the Di5v

cerned Attitudes OfAmerican Youth.
It‘s crap, really, but it sounds good
over Hotel and bus Station Muzak
systems.

The strength of rocknand ol the
culture behind it--is in discord.
The louder, the more discordant
and irantic rock gets, the better it
is for the straight world tolisten to.
THIS RECORD SHOULD BE
PLAYED LOUD.

merit, complete with a swinging
Benny Goodman clarinet sound. You
notice O’Sulli‘van's unusual singing
right away. He has a habit of ac
centing unaccented syllables and
Cutting words in half in the mostuns
expected places.

“Permissive Twit” is avery funny
ballad about a subject which is us-
ually a serious one: an unwanted
pregnancy. “on Heaven help our
Linda/She's really done it now/
Whatsmore it’s so obvious/ I mean
her stomachs sticking out/If lather
tells me' mother/She’s bound to have
a fit/Followed by a neat convulsion/
Thanks to our permissive twit.” He
goes on to tell us that she thinks the
culprit might have been Ronald, or
maybe Sid or Len. But she’s sure it
wasn't Bill or Ben,

There’s some orchestration onthis
song, but unlike Havens' album, it
doesn’t wreck the song.This islrue
for most of the album, but the pro-
ducer does tend to become carried
away on some of the orchestrated
brakes. “Nothing Rhymed”, a song
you may have been hearing on the
radio is one example. The song could
be excellent, but the abundance of
violins turns a beautiful sad lament
into a Boston Pops exercise.

’50’5 Sound

The second side of the album has
some true shining moments. “Too
Much Attention” starts off sound—
ing like a Santana cut, but O’Sullis
van handles it well, providing that
he can handle Serious rock as well
as llghtheared ballads. “Thunder
and Lightening” is also rock, but
this time with a ’50’s sound, com-
plete with a hard sax solo,

The last two cuts are the most
beautiful and serious. ”Houdini
Says” is a hauntingly beautilul song
with lyrics which gently question
those who think “that life isadrag ”
The music changes a number oi
times from a slow ballad sound to
an orchestrated toccata and fugue.
It's an incredibly interesting num-
ber. “We will” is another song
which has been played on AM radio
lately. it’s an orchestrated narra-
tive ballad; his singing is strange,
going on and on without a period.

No Corny Gimmick

“Well at my age i think standing
still would really suit me best/do
we all agre97/hands up thosewhode
we all agree?/ hands up those who
don’t/I see, well in that case will we
please be kind enough if not/onSun—
day to go to Mass on Monday." The
song is partially ruinedby an insipid
children's chorus, but on the whole
the listener is touched by the quiet
lyrics and music.

it's hard to say whether Gilbert
O'Sullival‘i will really catch on with
anyone. He delinitely needs a few
listenings before you can judge. What
first appears to be a cornygiminick
turns out to be a brilliant singer,
composer with a brilliant tirsl
album.
