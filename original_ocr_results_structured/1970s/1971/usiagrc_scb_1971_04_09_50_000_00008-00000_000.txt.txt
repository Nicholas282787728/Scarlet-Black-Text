THE SCARLET AND BLACK

Tennis Team Bows To Iowa State

Tuesday the Iowa State Uni—
versity Cyclone tennis team
beat the Grinnell netmen 8-1.
Freshman Brad Vazales,
playing in the number two
position, was the lone victor
for the Pioneers as he battled
to a three set victory over his
opponent.

The only other close match
was the threecset defeat of
Glenn Cushing, playing num-
ber six. Bruce Bonnewell and
Carlos Mondoza, playingnum-
bers three and four, both
played well but were just out
classed. Senior captain Ken
Schofield was defeated badly

Clark Wins IM BB;
Sottballers Start

IM basketball blundered to a
close just before break, end—
ing with a rash of forfeits as
most people had already left.
As expected, Clark walked off
with the honors, knocking off
ten pigeons.

In “the game ofthe century,"
Clark defeated l-iaines in a
closely officiatedhattle to virr
tually wrap up the title.
Haines, Read, and Smith tied
for second at 8-2, each losing
to Clark and suffering loses
from one of the others.

Bill Dicks of Clark nabbed
the high scoring title by av-
eraging over 20 pointsa game.

The highlight of the season
was the All-Star gamea'gainst
the Frosh team. The All-
Stars, composed of players
from all halls, lostby only one
point, despite Coach Boyd's
prediction of thirty.

Now softball starts. Fridays
will find a coed 16-inch softr
ball league premiering at
Grinnell. Response has been
good, and several teams have
been turned away due to lack
of space. Perhaps this shows
the way l'M's must go nextyear
to be successful.

Paddle tennis l'M‘s are next
Saturday. This is purely ex*
perimental, and all Grinnell
College students and faculty
are welcome to participate.
If you are interested, contact
Dick Pope. If there is good
response, this may become a
permanent feature. I. GIICK

at the number one singles
spot, but is fighting early sea-

In the doubles, all three Pio-
neer teams were soundly th-
rashed. Here especially, but
also in the singles, simple
lack of practice contributed to
the poor showing. Thisin con-

warm-up meets including
Arkansas, Oklahoma, and
Oklahoma State.

Outdoor Tracksters Win Opener

The highlight activity of the
athletic past week was the
unveiling of the track team.
Decked out in its classy new
uniforms, the Grinnell team
flexed its muscles in antici'
pation of an above‘average
season. Last Tuesday, on the
new track, Grinnell hosted
the teams ofSimpson and Cen-
tral. Perhaps not being very
hospitable, the tracksters re-
gistered a double victory. The
scores were 88 1/2~67 1/2
over Simpson and 9D— 53 over
the Centralians.

As far as individual perfor-
mances, especially not over‘
looking Ric McDowell's as-
tounding exhibition in the pole-
vaulter's mile relay, Coach
Obe was extremely pleased
with the team'sprogress. Phil
Morales set a field record in
the mile run, just barely ed—
.ging out teammate Eric Jahn.
The meet was startedandendv
ed on sweet notes as the pion‘
eers took both relays. The 440
relay team was Gray, Swan,
Siegfried, and Lewis. Themile
relay combination was Lewis,
Schooler, Swan, and Morales.
Other premier performers
were Eric Jahn in the 3-mile,
Bill Swan in the 440 dash,
Christopher ,Madsen in the
pole vault, and Morales in the
880 dash.

were performed by Huff in the

Prospects for this year's
team are good if everyone
plays to his potential. Last
year's 4-4 team is returning
nearly intact, hampered only
by the defection of Ed DeBus
to the Japanese. In addition,
a large number of talentedfrr
eshman also make up this
year's 14 man squad. The new
(7) head coach is none other
than john Pfitsch, who returns
to the tennis job after the de
parture ‘of Ed Mullins to
Swarthmore.

The netmen open conference
play this Weekend against
Lawrence and Ripon here at
Grinnell. If you enjoy tennis,
or merely want to lie in the
sun, come watch at 9 a.m.and
3 p.m. Pancho

in the high hurdles, Menden-
hall in the pole vault, Brennen
in the long'jump, and Pirolli
again in the 440 hurdles. All
of the above placed second.
It is quite apparent that Grin-
nell is quite strong since us-
ually these teams spike the
heck out of us every other
year.

Some of the highlights at the
meet were the Timmetts who
time both at track and swlma
ming meets for the One. Moe
Hunt fashioned a 19??Grinnel1

underestimated how really
cold it was and froze to death.
Well not really; We won.

The Grinnell golf team opens
its season today with a match
in Galesburg against Knoxand
Monmouth, the number one and
two teams in the conference
last year. Under the direction
of Coach Bowers, who is pre-
sently in the warm Georgia
sun watching the Masters, the
golfers hope to finish in the
first division after a dismal
9th place conference finish
last year.

Young Baseball Team Rebuilds

This season looks like a
building season for the Pion-
eers of Boyd's Bombers on
the varsity baseball team.
Coach Boyd is emphasizing a
youth movement this spring
(perhaps trying to prevent the
creation of an Establishment
senior clique) as he has but
one senior on the squad (and
a non-starter at that). Mostof
the rest of his players are
preps. Prospects, with this
much youth, look grim for a
winning season; but this is in
keeping with the Grinnell Tra-
ditioln of Athletics. Things
can't be all bad, however, as
much of last year's pitching
staff, which had an ERA of
over 10.00, has graduated.
Among the most notable of
the players this year is Bill
”Flipper" Dicks, who will
anchor the Corps of Pitchers,
those stalwarts who, like the
sacriﬁcial lamb, gamely take
their places on that altar, the
pitching mound. Also note-
worthy is Uber-Jude Mike
Levy who often catches the
pitchers’ offerings. Amongthe

Soccer Players

On Sunday, April 4, a group
from Grinnell journeyed to
Ames, Iowa, to participate in
what might loosely be called
a soccer game. The opponents
turned out to be a team from
Iowa State. There isabsoluter
ly no truth to the rumor that
the team was actually a class

Princeton Illinois, hopefully
recovered from a head injury

Sunday, sophomore Al Sch-
oene, anather of the Alton,
Illinois, bunch (Why isn‘t he a

Mike Burkle of Grinnell. Gary
Johnson of Grinnell football
fame is also playing golf this
year.

The Pioneer golfers play
eight matches, including a two
day meet at UNland Wart‘ourg,
the 3.5 hole Hawkeye Invita-
tional at University of Iowa,
and the Conference Meet at
Cedar Rapids on May 14 and
15. Thereare twohomemeets,
the first this Tuesday against
Coe, Cornell, William Penn,
and Simpson. Duff Hooker

preps are Blake Plakesley,
who hits, and Wes Fugii, who
plays infield. Representing the
seniors andadding leadership,
wisdom, and stability to the
team is J. C. Labowitz.

The teams to beat this year
are, according to my sour~
ces, Monmouth (last year’s
Conference Champion), Knox,
and Cornell. Another bright
spOt, along with the loss of
much of last year’s pitching
corpse, is that Grinnell’s lone
victory of last season was
over Knox, to cost them the
championship. Right on, guys.
Your season will be a success
just if you do it again this
year. *
Just because of the improve-
ment in the pitching depart-
ment, Grinnell stands to
double its number ofvictories
this season. Blind luck should
add a third win. 01 well, one
advantage to having a youthful
team is that they‘ll be back
next year and have a remote
idea of what they are doing.

The outrofa shape but full-ofa

came out fast and dominated
the first half of play. Grinnell
led on the only goal of the
first half, a close»in shot by
Dave Coron. As the players
tired and the defenses sagged
a little, Grinnell was able to
take a 3-0 leadonanother goal

from the track team and played
a fine game at goalie. Jim

scoring opportunities. A lot
of Grinnell scoring opportun-
ities were turned away too,
mostly by the Grinnell front
line. For the mostpart, every-

beautiful sunny afternoon in
central Iowa. If you don't be-
