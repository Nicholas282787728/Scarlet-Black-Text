Coordinators'l’lan Busy Year

The Student Coordinators 0ft

fice hopes to play a more
important part in student life
at Grinnell this year. Cue
coordinators Terry Clifford
and Bob Meyer, and Assistant
Coordinator Craig Kugisaki
head this office, located in the
basement of the Forum.

The primary function of the
office, says, Meyer, is to act
as a liason between the ad-
ministration, the faculty, and
the student body. The office
acts asa springboardfor com-
plaints and inquiries, andMe‘
yer expressed hope that the
office will be able to speed
action on such matters thus
solving various problems
more expeditiously than stu-
dents could do so on their
own.

The office should be espec-
ially helpful to new students
who do not know how various
groups on campus function;
all questions can be asked at
one central office.

A major goal this year is to
keep students and others in-
formed about what the numer
rous committees are doing;
the office intends to publicize
decisions that are impending,
so students will be informed
in advance, as well as de-
cisions that are made; it will
provide information about the
process committees use to
reach a decision.

Announcements will be posr
ted on the Central Campus
Bulletin board, and weekly
bulletins will be posted in
each residence hall. The bul»
letin board was this year’s
initial project and provides a
systematic listing ofall com-
mittees, their heads, and any
vacancies on each committee.

Any mistakes on the board

, .can.‘ be corrected by calling
‘the‘Student Coordinators Of-
fice.

Evaluations Soon

Results of Grinnell's first
formal student evaluation of
courses will be available soon,
says James Hortois (poli sci).
Hottois, James Hamilton
(econ), Karl DeLong(bio),and
George Furniss (sociology),
comprise the committee res-
ponsible for evaluating the
evaluations.

Responses to the ques-
tionaires distributed in all
classes last semester were
tabulated during the summer.
The committee will issue a
report outlining the results
and suggesting improvements
in the evaluation program. The
program was student~initia-
ted, and the original ques-
tionaire was largely students
written.

Although the report is not
yet is its final form, Hortois
says the major problem was
low response. Only 45% of
the questionaires distributed
were completed and returned.

For the very best--

Foreign Students live 0n Coke

by Kyle Schaub

Coke bottles may help to
ease the cost of living for
Grinnell’s 11 foreign students.
The battle deposits are being
collected by the Foreign Stu-
dent Board, (who also main-
tains the coke machines,) and
placed into a special financial
assistance fund.

The type of assistance ranr
ges from personal mainter
nancc to room and board. The
Board also help to find 10d.
ging over vacation periods and
any necessary jobs.

In addition to providing these
services, the Board attempts
to make the foreign students“
adjustment to campus life a
smooth transition--both acas

demically and socially.

Some of the social activities
planned include “casual and
exotic" dinners and foreign
food bazaars. The Bazaars,
which also include the com,
munity, sell international food
samples prepared by mem-
bers and volunteers. The ba-
zaars also have folk dancing
to set the atmosphere.

A regular activity of the
Board is the “International
Table” set up in Gardner
Lounge, located underneath
the Quad. Held each week,
the sit- down dinners welcome
any students and faculty who
want to meet and talk with
foreign students.

Grad School Examinations

To Be Give

On Six selccled dates this fall
and next spring college se-
niors hoping to pursue their
quest for knowledge in grar
duate schools will, with sweat
ty palms, parade into testing
rooms across the country and
go through the annual ritual
of taking thc Graduate Record
Examinations.

The tests will be given here
at Grinnell on two dates, once
in the fall (October 23) and
once in the spring (January
15). Grinnell seniors \vhowish
to make a traveling vamtion
of the ordeal may wish to
takc the tests at lowa City
or Des Moines, in which case
they have their choice of four
more testing dates<Dccember
11, February 26, April 22,
and June 17). The Law School
Admission Test Will also be
given here twice, on October
16 and February 12. The test
for PreeMcd students, accor-
ding to Professor Mendoza,
is given only once, next May
l, because it is practically
always taken at the end of
the junior year rather than
during the senior year.

The regular Grad RecordExV
amination is divided into two
parts, an Aptitude Test in the
morning and an Advanced Test
in the afternoon, each a de-
lightful three hours long. The
morning test, reminiscent of
those old familiar College
Boards, consists of a verbal
and a mathematical part,
scored separately. The real

fun comes later in the day,
however, with the Advanced
Test. it tests specific know-
ledge of the major field, and
unlike the first part is us-
ually taken only after days
of study and review of old
teth and notes. The closer
the testing date, the more
intensive the studying and the

sweatier the palms. It's all a
great game.

Test fees vary With indivi-
dual tests, but generally run
to $8.00 for the Aptitude test
and $9.00 for the Advanced
Test. The LSAT costs a mere
$12.00 for the whole package.

Test scores may be sent to
three accredited graduate in-
stitutions, to fellowship-gram
ting agencies, and to the per
son tested without additional
Charge. For a fee of $2.00
scores are sent elsewhere,
too. Results usually go out
two to three months after
the testing date, therefore the
service (and most department
chairmen here) recommend
taking the tests as early as
possible. It is also to your
advantage to register wellber
fore the test date, or you may
run the risk of being trans-
ferred to a different center
or a different testing date.

booklet describing the types of
questions asked, advice for
preparation, and a complete
listing of test dates and can
ters is available in the Re
gistrar's office.
