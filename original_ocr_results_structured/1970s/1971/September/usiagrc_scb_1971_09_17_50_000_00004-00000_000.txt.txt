Human Relations

During his interview with the S 8: l3, Randall
Morgan urged us to try and make this College
community an example of a truly free society,
where academic and social freedom flourish side
by side.

Sensing a ”viable commitment” by members of
the Executive Council to make Grinnell an Equal
Opportunity Employer at all levels, Morgan cau-
tioned that the whole atmosphere of the school
will need change if members of minority groups
who accept employment here are to feel enough
at ease to remain.

A change in the spirit of the place cannot be
accomplished by administrative dictum; all of
us must help. Morgan suggested that a campus
wide Human Relations Council be established,
at student initiative, both to recommend inno-
vations and to act on complaints. We think the
idea merits serious consideration.

KDIC Salaries

KDIC, the student radio station of Grinnell Cole
lege, deserves more defense than it actually
received at Monday’s meeting of the Joint Board
of house presidents to discuss the first semester
1971-72 Student Government budget.

To be sure, it was the salaries of the station's
five executive board members that was the ac-
tual object of debate, but we can hardly help feer
ling that there was something of a lack of un-
derstanding among house presidents and some
finance committee members as to the impor-,

tance of KDIC to the community and the im-
portance of well trained, enthusiastic -- and

well paid -- students on the executive board.

KDICexecutive board members must plan and
supervise about 134 hours ofbroadcast time each
week. The chief engineer is on call 24 hours
a day to fix anything that malfunctions.

Salaries in the radio budget were initially exar
mined at Monday's meeting because they seemed
to take up a very sizeable segment of the SGA
budget, yet they actually total less than the
salaries for SGA officials (which the Board
considered raising by 25% from the finance
committee’s porposal) and they are roughly
comparable to salaries of 5818 editors and
business manager, which were never called into
question.

Clayton Lee, station manager, must have felt
that some of the house presidents at Monday's
meeting did not know too much about KDIC,
for after the meeting he offered to give them a
guided tour of the station facilities at any time.

They seemed to like the idea and chose Sa-
turday morning for their tour; it will surely
be interesting to Clayton, and to the S&B re-
porter who will be at the station Saturday mor-
ning, to see just how seriously the HP’s do
take their duty to inspect and evaluate the ope—
ration of the student radio station.

We hOpe the Joint Board will restore the sal-
aries for KDIC executive board members, who
do a lot of work for very little recognition.

”Washingion Correspond

by curl Cornell
Washington, D.C.
Primcd with background in-
formation derived from pic
ture postcards and impressed
by comments from authors
such as Roger Hilsman, who
described Washington, D.C.
as ”The nerve center of the
nation's power...the business
of Washington is making de
cisions that move a nation,"
I found that initially the meet
surprising feature Washing
ton, D.C. offered was its ba‘
sic physical similarity to all
other cities I have visited.
Polluted Potomac

The new Kennedy Memorial
Center is adjacent totheslug-
gish, polluted Poromac River.
The Washington Monument,
when viewed at my first op
portunity, wasallbutobscured
by the smog; the Lady Bird
Johnson Park, appeared from
my taxi window to be a mcro
strip of greenery hemmed in
on all sides by land conceded
to the concrete and asphalt
roadways which interlace the
capital, Even a simple trip
from campus to Capitol Hill
renders, in transit, a hard
look at the urban ghetto.

In short, as a city Washing

ton shares most of the gene
eral appearances and pro-
blems of all major U.S. Cl’

No Eagles

The American University,
housing base for all Washing-

in spite of its formidable li’
tie, a collection of red, white,
and blue painted dorms wuh
caglcs on every mantle. One
finds buildings of Elli shapes
and sizes, but like almost
every college campus, there
are [hC familiar markings of
”Library”, ”Gymnasium”,
and ”Registrar".

And yet, for all its outward
similarity with other large
urban areas, there exists
something different about War
shington, something which
cannot be revealed by a dose
cription of Washington as a
city, but which is best dcr
picted when describing Wash
ington as a place to be. There
is an undercurrent of dynar

Should We Boycott KDIC?

To; All ldealistic Grinnellions Looking For A Cause

BY Jack Doppelt

Our rightsare beingviolated.
We have been the pawns of
ignorance too long. Now isthe
time to retaliate. Our method:
Boycott KDIC.

You ask why? It’s a simple
matter of a 23/4 hour bud-
get meeting. Those who at—
tended now realize how “1’
tle we know about the opera
tion and expenditures of the
radio station. And we have a
right to know. KDIC has been
allotted $2,400 from the li-
mited SGA budget for the lst
semester.

Reirigerote Funds

Do you know what technical
equipment KDIC uses or what
this $2,400 is needed for?
Neither does the Joint Board.
So they froze all appropria-
tions to KDIC except these
named to run the station un-
til KDIC submits an invenr
tory list of their equipment
and a statement of the duties
of the KDIC executive board.
Freezes seem to be in this
year. I’d prepare for a rough
winter. Now here’s where we
come in. The Joint Board
feels that it cannOt, in good
conscience, permit KDIC to
continue under full capacity

until they know if KDIC is sq’ ,

uandcring funds. The Joint
Board is doing this to pro-
tect the uninformed student.
Now we are informed. We can
protect ourselves. That‘s
where the boycott comes in.
Don’t listen to KDIC, work
for KDIC, talk to anyone con
nected with KDIC, or go near
Darby Gym (that's where the
station is-rsee how uninforr
med you are) until KDIC pre
sents the facts. I feel like
Joe McCarthy in front ofa
Senate subrcommitteo hear-
ing.
Ignorant Constituents

r\s long as the Joint Board
fcels it’s their duty to protect
their ignorant constituents, I
might as well be as altruis-
tic.

'l'his is for your own good.
Get under the bright lights.
This interrogation won‘t take
long. Do you know how the
President of the SGA earns
her kccp? All 35150 a 56m»
ester of it? I'd follow her a,

round and report on her acre
ivities myself, but I'd colr
lapse of exhaustion. Do you
know how the S&B funds are
used?l Do you know what er
quiment the 5&8 has in its
office, aside from papers SI’
rwen all over the floor? What
if I were to tell you that the
$3,250 a semester the S&B
gets from the SGA budget
goes for Scotch andlBourbon'?
That's what the 8&8 stands
for to begin with.

After we boycott KDIC, our
next step is to evaluate the
inventory list they submit.
The Joint Board admitted that
no one at the meeting, except
the chief engineer of KDIC,
could assess the need and
expense of every generator
and amplifier they use. So
the chief engineer will cvalur
ate the list he himself com-
piled. By intense calculation
and my flair for premonition,
I deduce he'll conclude his
list is satisfactory. The only
proposed change in the wages
of the executive board of
KDIC will be a $25 increase
to the chief engineer for the
work put into compiling this
data.

Save Your Years

Until they produce a stat?
ment, KDIC will broadcast as
a bare minimum output po»
tential and probably will lose
any audience it had hoped l0
entertain. By boycotting, we
also won't have to listen to
inferior broadcasnng. Consb
der it a Save Your Ears Came
paign.

If you aren’t up for this cone
structive action, try going to
Joint Board meetings to learn
rationale behind inconsistent
cies. You may discover why
the KDIC executive board has
to Justify their salaries and
why the SGA Board doesn’t
or why the 8&8 merits trust
and 1(ch warrants suspicion
and rcsuictions.

Russian House Says
$8.8 Writer A Joke

To the Editor:

I have been instructed to
inform you that we find Mr.
John Wily unsatisfactory as
a reporter to cover Russian
House. We find him inaccur‘
are, insulting, and generally
obnoxious. Russian House is
a language project in which
we are trying to learn how to
speak Russian fluently. Your
Mr. Wily apparently considers
us a big joke set up to supply
him with funny articles to
carry his by* line. Ourgovernt
ment here has decided not to
have any more interviews with
him and would beappreciative
if you would be so kind as to
send us a qualified journalist
in the future, not a writer of
the Sunday funnies.

Commisar of Propaganda

Guru“ Replies To
Russ House Charges

To the Editor:
”The Commissar of Propa-

‘ ganda for the Russian House,

Howard Miska, in his recent
communique to the Pink and
Gray has once again clearly
indicated the Russian House's
desire to undermine the Ar
merioan way of life by at
tacking the cherished right of
the college press to be miS’
leading and unintelligible.
This direct attempt to inter-
vene in the internal operations
of the sovereign campus com?
munity cannot be tolerated.
although we are clearly cog'
nizant that some serious vent
tures do occasionally occurat
the Russian House, this minor
point should nor obscure the
real truth about this institur
tion. Mr. Wylic’s right to
mislead the public will be
defended by all the means at
our disposal."

have made much difference if
he had been there.
