, Gridders to open ,
' against Coe' g»

by Dave Calvert

Football at Grinnell may have
emerged from the darkness of the
virtual nonstop losing oi the early
seventies. At least that is the
conviction on this year‘s deter-
mined squad of gridders. Led by a
rehabilitated coaching crew, some
determined caplains, 15 lettermen,
and an exceptionally impressive
group at freshmen, the Pioneers
seem ready to take on anybody.

Uiiiortunately, the first
”anybody” of the 1974 Season is the
tough Coe team, which piles into
Ward Field tomorrow for the 1:30
p.m. contest. The Kohawks,
defending Midwest Athletic
Conference football champions,
are a cinch to nail down one of the
top spots in the conierence again
this year. They will not be disposed
to giving Grinnell a win on thls
opening day.

Nobody is more aware of this
than Head Coach Edd Bowers.
“We couldn't have drawn a much
tougher opening day foe,“ he said
earlier this week.

The last time Grinnell duelell
Coe on opening llny at Ward Field
was two years ago, when the

eers recorded a rare triple
vll . The football, soccer and cross
country squads managed to sweep
all three events that day, and all
from Cue.

The mood on the football team

this year smacks of men who‘ve
been through the Grinnell athletic
experience and know how easy it is
to lose, but yet feel that this year
may somehow be different.
. Senior co-captain Jim Casey
displayed this when he told the
5843 this week that the team was
“better, but still not great. We lack
depth and size, but we’ve achieved
a sense of team cohesiveness.
Nobody out there is in it for himself
alone.”

The other cocaptian, junior
running back Tom Goetz, echoed
Casey's sentiments. “We’ve had a
pretty good turnaround in attitude.
and deiinitely more hope this
year,”

Goetz also had priase for the
coaching, especially commending
newly arrived assistant coach Ron
Mitchell for his toughness. “He‘s
big on discipline,” Goetz observed.

Bowers, about to tormally
commence his fifteenth season as
Grinnell football coach, also sees
hope. While emphasizing the lack
of size of the Pioneer squad this
year, he iinds reason enough ior
good cheer.

“l'in happy with the way
practice has been going," he noted
earlier this week. “Our men want
to play winning iootball and appear
to be willing to pay the price."

The coaching staii has been
especially pleased with the per
formance oi the ireshman con»
tingent, Freshmen could fill as
many as ll of the 22 starting spots
on the oliensive and defensive
platoons. One position that will
undoubtedly be manned by a {resin
men is quarterback, where two
talented iirst year men,

Paul ‘

Crane and Randy Reavis, are .s'

fighting ior the job.
Perhaps assistant coach
Maurice “Mo” Hunt is the wisest,
however. When asked to make a
predicition on tomorrow‘s up
coming tilt with coe. Hunt winked,
“I'll wait ’til after Saturday.”

End of

_ by Dave Scllcchler

It took years to form the
memories, it will take just $5,000
and a iew seconds to tear them
down, According to plan, this will
be the last year that the Grinnell
College football team periorms on
Ward Field. Despite its traditional
proximity to the campus, the 707
plus year old structure has become
an eyesore and a saiety hazard.
The other reason for the planned
Change is the donation of $15,000 by
an alumnus ior the building oi
bleachers on what_is now the
iootball practice iield just to the
north oi the tennis courts. These
bleachers are just part or a long
range plan ior the physical
education and athletics depart-
ments that have been in the works
since the building oi the PEC in
1970.

Ward Field in itseli is an
amazing structure it is these
amazements that are the main
cause oi its planned removal. For
one the structure is over seventy
years old and has developed many
massive cracks in both the walls
and seats that cause a safety
problem, Also, when Ward Field
was built it was not laid brick by
brick; railroad box cars oi cement
were poured into a mold making
Ward rield, one solid piece of
concrete. In fact, the ad-
ministration isn't even sure how
far down the ioundation runs. One
estimate runs up to 20 feet down.

Women roll Tomorrow

by Jean Miliigan
Tomorrow begins the women's
volleyball and tield hockey season.
The tennis team home tournament
was postponed by Car: due to th'e
late opening of Coe and resulting
lack or team practice. Ms. Donna
Meck’s volleyball team meets Wm,
Penanraceland in Oskaloosa. The
field hockey team starts its season
against one of its most difficult
competitors, U.N.l. The game will
be played at to am. in Cedar Falls,
la.
Ms Anita Wack feels Grinnell

should have at least as good a
tennis team as last spring if not
better

Ms, Hath has Confidence in her
field hockey team She has a
veteran oiiense and only two new
players on defense. To practice
game situations, Hoth is interested
in having anyone come out just ior
scrimmages on Thursdays at 4:30
in Mac Field. Commenting on her
expectations tor the team, Hoth
said, ”If we‘re going to put it
together, this is the year to do it”.

Spring golszonference 3rd

liy Arturo Tania

The Grlnllell College goli team
placed third in the Conference golf
meet last May at Cedar Rapids,
The strong teams oi Carleton and
St. olai upset the sandbagger’s bid
to grab back to back conierence
championships. The Pioneers
combined score of 626 left
them 17 strokes behind Carleton's
winning total, and 14 behind second
place St olai.

Leading the Pioneer eiiort was
Arturo Tapia who placed fourth
individually with a two round total
or 125, three strokes oil the winning

pace. Former individual Con-
icrcnce champ Ken Ellenson was
off his game, but still managed a
respectable score oi ibis, Jon
Rensenhouse at l57 and Pete
Friend at 163 rounded out the
Pioneer scoring. Al Jesscn also
competed in the important meet.

The golf squad should again
prove to he a solid contender tor
the spring season with Ren-
senhouse, Tapia, and Jessen
returning, and the arrival of at
least two promising iroshmen,
Mike Ilopkins and David Van
derpool.

Ward Field

But Ward Field will not be torn
down immediately for as college
president Glenn Leggett says there
is still the problem of finding
someone who wishes to donate the
$5,000 needed for the razing oi the
building.

Leggett has long been in favor of
the Field‘s removal,

This past summer, A.l3
Rosenbloom, ’34, donated 15,000
dollars for the building of the new
bleachers, and you don't bite the
hand that feeds you. Two local
iirms, Stadiums Unlimited inc,
and Miracle Recreation Equips
ment Co., have been contracted to
put in the seating, to total 1,500
(both are nationally known local
firms run by Grinnell alums).
Stadiums Unlimited will put in
portable seating for 500 on the east
side of the field and Miracle
Recreation will put in bolted down
seating ior 1,000 on the west side oi
the iield. Other plans for the area
include the iorming oi a parking
area to the cast of the field, and the
installation oi restroom and press
box facilities.

When Ward Field and the cinder
track are removed there will be a
large grassy expanse running from
the North Campus logia to the
railroad tracks. All of this is part of
a plan that also calls {or the
possible building oi eight new
tennis courts-four east of the
present ones and iour behind the
PEG (those could be built so as to
iacilitate hockey play in the
winter), other parts oi the plan
call for the continued regrading oi
the fields north of 10th avenue that
was begun when the iirm ot
Skidmore, Owens, and Merrill built
the PEC. Thc advantage of the
portable bleachers would be their
mobility ior use in sections as
track, baseball, soccer and other
outdoor events, in addition to use
inside the PEC

Leggett does however note that
many oi the long range plans could
be called “dreaming" at this point.
Jim Avison, director of develop-
ment (and chief fund raiser) for
the college, Said that none of this
“would happen without specitic
donors.” Avison also said that,
“When the PEC was being conr
structcd a committee was formed

. with representatives irom the
Men’s and Women's PE depart»
ments on it . , and we Started
planning . . , this was definitely not
a haphazard thing.”

Leggett. in a meeting held in the
oiiice oi college dean Waldo
Walker, said that both he and
football coach Edd Bowers hope
that the grass field nortll of 10th
has matured enough by next year
to make it playable, Grillllell
College is well blessed with some of
the best outdoor facilities and

grass fields anywhere, Leggett
Commented about Ward Field,
”The problem Is that it is solid
concrete and we don’t even know
how deep it goes . . . Right now we
don’t have the money tor taking it
down.”

With the razing of Ward Field,
named after Herbert C. Ward '90,
by the class oi 1393, will go many
fond memories of enjoyable
weekends that stretch back three
generations. “There are always
students and alumni who no matter
what it is that gets torn down hate
some sentimental attachment to it
...Tllat Is a legitilniatc cmotional
concern but the college can't
operate on pure emotion,” said
Avison. in this case it is much too
bad that it can't.

Pick soccer
co-cap’ralns

Dave Calvert, Mark Hanisch,
and Jim ”Sandy" Rikoon were
elected co-captains of the soccer
team in full team elections held
last week, All three are seniors,
although only Calvert has played
soccer all iour years at Grinnell.
Hanisch joined the squad in his
sophomore year, and leoon joins
oiiicially this year, having been
ineligible last year. Rikoon
transferred from University of
Pennsylvania, where he played
varsity ball.

The new captains succeed Roger
Kumlcr and Peter Horowitz. both
of the class of 1974. Kumler was
most valuable player on the squad
in his junior and senior years,
while Horowitz led the team in
scoring over the same two years.

Despite the graduation of these
standouts, Coach John Pfitsch
apparently is not worried.

“I think we have a solid team,"
he commented earlier this week
“We lack a super star who will go
out and collect three or iour goals
every game, But we don’t have any
glaring weaknesses."

Just how strong the team is will
be tested in tomorrow’s opening
match at Cedar Rapids, 1a.,
against Coe. The Kol-lawks, a team
that has improved rapidly over the
years, are a traditional opening
day ioe. Although Coe spoiled the
Pioneer home debut here last year
372, the year before, at C08,
Grinnell came up with a 6-1
shellacking of the Kohawks. Three
goal scorers irom that 6-] eiiort
two years ago—Lester Ose, Pete
Shearer, and Calvertmwill he in
tomorrow‘s starting iorward line.

For Pfitsch tomorrow will have a
special significance. The contest
will mark his first as a soccer
coach, and he is, by his own ads
mission, “very excited.”

“I just hope," declares Pfitsch,
“I don’t screw them up out there;
I've screwed up a lot oi teams
before.”

Let’s hope.
