arise." said Kramer. “I can't be
more speciiic until i start working
as SGA president."

The run-oii attracted 597 voters,
which election board chairman
Kim King said was a “pretty high
turnout." Kramer said he at-
tributed the high turnoul to the
kinds of campaign he and Melissa
anp ran.

"MELISSA AND I seemed to go
to no end to get people to vote," he
said

Kramer‘s election Monday
{allowed a preliminary election
last Wednesday in which he and
Hopp emerged as the iinalists over
Jon Christianson and Harvey Left.
Hopp led Kramer by nine votes in
the first race but failed to garner a
majority, so a run-o“ was needed.

HIS ADMINISTRATION will
have “less political bullshit" than
previous SGA administrations, he
said. “That is, (it will) stop
treating SGA as some big political
system and treat it like a iunction
