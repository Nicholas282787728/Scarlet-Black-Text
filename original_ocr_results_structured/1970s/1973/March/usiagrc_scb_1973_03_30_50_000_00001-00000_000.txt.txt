The cluster Concept has beenin ef-
fect for the last two years. During
the 71-72 school year most of the
black students on campus lived in
Younkers, and this year black stu»
dents have been distributed through»
out the campus, clustered on var»
lous floors.

Celestine Bloomfieldand Burshella
DeKowperlandth appeared at the J-B
meeting Wednesday to representthe
views of the black students. Ms,
Bloomfield spoke strongly in favor
of the concept, citingprobiemsofad—

'tem,

justment for freshmen and the need
for black students to not be over-
whelmed by the large white majority
on campus.

A statement issued by CBS empha~
Sized the problem of black fresh~
men saying that “in the past the
problems of adjustment to Grinnell
have been magnilied by misleading
counseling...We credit this problem
to the fact that the college counsel-
ors, because of their various back-
grounds, have been unresponsive and
are therefore not totally qualified
to counsel black students in general
and black freshmen in particular."

Associate Dean'of Student Affairs
Jim Tederman also spoke forcefully
for the retention of the cluster sys»
saying that "black students
have convinced me,” andalso noting
that the dispersion of the clusters
this year was the result ota com-
promise with black students follow-
ing problems arising outotthe large
clusters in Younkers.

John Potts, SGA Vice-President,
also spoke in favor of the measure,
saying that “blacks may have spec»
ial difficulties adjusting to Grin-

News Analysis

Indian Arrests Criticized

by the Peace Collective

Before many students returned to school, a questionable action of law
enforcement was executed in Poweshiek County, While the mass media
was concentrating on the return of the POW’s, the Justice Department
was seizing new prisoners in its current war with the indian people.
On Saturday, March 24, five Indians from New York were arrested while
traveling on I»80 South of Grinnell. .

Because Mad Bear Anderson and our other Native Americans were
heading toward Wounded Knee, South Dakota, with load and clothing,
they were considered to be in violation ofa Federal law which prohibits
Crossing state lines to aid and abet a riot.

When questioned what “aid and abet” means, the Federal prosecuting
attorney, Evan i-iultman, stated that supplying indians at Wounded Knee
with food, clothing and even insulin is illegal by law if‘suppliers cross
state lines. In a search of the Anderson vehicle, no arms or ammunition
were found.

In addition to the five arrested in Poweshiek County, five Indians from
Miohigan,were arrested a tow hours earlier in Cedar County, The ten
were subsequently moved to Waterloo and incarcerated in the Blackhawk
County jail. On Monday, March 26, the Waterloo ten were brought before
Federal judge Fred Clark, .

Before the proceedings i-iultman spoke to newsmen, When questioned
on the warrant and arrest process Hultman reluctantly stated that the
Warrants were issued "outside the Northern District of Iowa” in a broad
form and were specifically filled out at the time of arrest-John Doe
warrants for Indians traveling to South Dakota,

Another source indicates that warrants with specific names were sworn
out based on names obtained by telephone taps at Wounded Knee.

At the hearing an arrangement was worked out in which the ten were
released upon signing a statement in which they agreed to return straight
home after posting an unsecured $1000 bond each. This meant that the
bond would not be collected unless the defendants did not return home
directly.

In a conference after the proceedings, Mad Bear conceded satisfaction
with the deal after Hultman expressed a dedication to get the supplies
through to Wounded Knee Hultman cited a court order requiring the gov—
ernment to allow supplies ilito the embattled area

The arrest and incarceration of the Waterloo ten is not an isolated
incident»»there have been a rash of such arrests nationwide including
sixteen at the Nevada-Calitornia border. These sixteen were planning
to give the supplies to the National Council oi Churches in Denver to be
later taken to Wounded Knee. Included ill the group were physicians and
clergymen. in response to questioning by newsmen, a spokesman tor the
Interior Department said about the arrests to “expect more of the same."

The above indicates the borderline constitutionality of Federal anti-riot
laws. Such a broad interpretation allows the jailmg of people simply
on the grounds of humanitarian concern and action. Above all, the action
indicates a new direction of Federal response to Indians, away from the
violent coercion and mass murder of the nineteenth Century to the sub-
tleties of authoritarian legal coercion of the twentieth.

 

 

 

of thought during two periods in history."

eenth century and the other on the
nineteenth century. Participants will
analyze the influence of the arts,
languages, science, literature, and
other fields. The four faculty mem»
bers in each class will split into
pairs, each pair taking 20 students
to analyze specific subjects. stu-
dents Will alternate between faculty
pairs during the duration of the
semester, studying a variety of
different topics.

“The program will be humanities
-oriented," said Walker, “but we
will involve people from disciplines
outside the humanities as well as
inside." The eight professors par»
ticipating in the program will be
Don Smith, Morris Parslow, Peter
Connelly, Beryl Clottelter, James
Kissane, Joseph Wall,R0iiald Kurtz,
and Richard Howe.

The project is expected to help
fill a “gap between the freshman
tutorial and the senior seminar,"
said Walker, and should provide “a
liberal arts offering we can fire
up students about” during the soph-
omore and junior years.

The college also hopes to be able
to lund the program for years in the
future, expanding it to include more
participants in subsequent years.
