Hoth: Women
Tennis To Start

by Dave Calvert

Are there enough women tennis
players at crinhell to merit lorm~
ing a separate team? This queSr
tion will be answered soon, and all
indications are that the answer will
be in the affirmative. Sandra Hath
already has the names ot “about
six or seven" oo»ed players and
anticipates calls from several oIr
hers. If sufficient interest is shown,
intersschool competition is both
possible and probable. M5. Hoth
hopes tor a lull schedule, includ-
ing contests against the likes at
Iowa State, U at Northern Iowa,
U of Iowa, Cornell, C06, Monmouth,
and Knox.

Women who would like to play
tennis this spring should contact
Ms. Hoth at the PE. Complex as
soon as possible.
