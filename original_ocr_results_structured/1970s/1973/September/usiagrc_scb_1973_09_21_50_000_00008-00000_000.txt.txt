.3-2 Soccer Upset

. by Dave Calvert

A late kohawk goal gave Coe a
3>Z victory and spoiled Grinnell’s
soccer home opener Saturday. It
was the first time Coe had beaten
Grinnell in over three years, al»
though in last year’s season finale
the Kohawks gained a 2-2 tie.

Playing on a soaked iield and in a
light drizzle, two things became
apparent early in the game. First,
this Coe team was iar better than
the. Coe squad beaten bythe Pioneers
6-1 on opening day last year. Their
passes were sharp and they consis-
tenily got oii good shots»on»goal.

Second, the Scarlet and Black pl-
ayers were not as iired up as were
the Kohawks. A certain emotional
factor was not there One sideline-
sage commented that the team look-
ed over-confident.

Grinnell appeared to be in control
early as the Pioneer iorwards and
halibacks kept sufficient pressure
on Coe’s veteran goalie. Midway
through the hali,,suphomore Pete
Shearer began the scoring with an
unassisted breakaway goal. Coe
bounced back on a spinning ground»
shot which just eluded the g‘rasp oi
‘Grinnell goalie Jim Freeman. Coe’s
second score iollowed shortly, givs
ing them a Z»l halftime edge.

The second halt was heralded by

.A plague oi turnovers cost Grin—
neII an opening game victory as Coe
rolled to a 41-7 win. The Kohawks
took advantage of good field position
and precise execution to convertthe
Grinnell mistakes into points.

The Pioneers gave up iive iumb»
les and iour interceptions, most oi
them deep in Grinneil territory.
Aside from the mistakes, the Pie-
neer's play was usually respect-
able. The defense showed flashes

a cold rain, which got worse as the
game progressed. The later stages

oi the contest were played in a heavy
downpour,

The Grinnell oiiensive line was
unable to score, despite severalgol»
den opportunities, until Peter l-Ioro-
witz, tied it up well into the hair.
Horowitz, who led the squad in
scoring last year with 10 goals,
took a periect “cross” pass irom
Lester 059 and ruled it into the
right side oi the net.

playing iuriously ior the win, Gr»
innell iailed to score the tiebreak»
er. It is ironic that Coe, content
to settle ior the lie, was trying to
slow things down when a Kohawk
iorward managed to breakaway down
the right wing tor the game-winnlng
goal. The goal came with only a
iew, minutes remaining and proved
decisive.

There are a number oi excuses
available to the Pioneers--the re»
ieree, the rain, the gastro-intestin»
al ilu»»but they are not to blame
ior the loss While everybody pla»
yed adequately, Grinnell was unable
,to come up with the big play, Time
and again little mistakes kept the
pioneers oii the scoreboard.

Losing the openergives this week’s
road tilt with Knox added import»
ance.

Pounded

oi brilliance, especially on the part
oi linebacker Jim Casey, as did the
oiiense, but there was an overall
lack oi consistency.

The lone Pioneer touchdown came
in the last quarter on Grinnell’s
only real drive oi the game, a 15-
yard ilauker-around run by Jim
Fallace to the six-inch line set up
iullback Tom Goetz’s plunging scA
ore. rrosh quarterback Paul De»
Ianey showed promise in both the
passing and running departments.

Field Hockey Opens

year and team members are prac-
ticing iour times a week in prepar-
ation for their home opener tomo-

Across the country college and

ations are being contributed to by
playing, During this time the NCAA,
has been virtually inactive. Sports
Illustrated recently noted that Some
42 schools have dropped iootball
because oi huge expenditures.

As a small, liberal arts college
Grinnell College runs an intercoll—
egiate sports program on a scale
many times smaller than, say, the
University oi Iowa. The budget ior
men’s intercollegiate athletics here
was $29,291 last year. The women’s
budget is currently part oi the
physical education budget but is
being moved into the intercollegiate
budget as interest increases. Ath-
letic Director John Plitsch, a 25
year veteran oi Grinnell sports,
comments, “the way the budget is,
we can iunction minimally, doing a
good job .in our conierence in re»
lation to other schools our budget
is pretty low. .we do a better job
in some areas, and they (schools
with larger budgets) do a better job
in others.” He noted that Grinnell
and Monmouth college (tomorrow’s
iootball opponent) have the lowest
budgets in the conierence while
Carleton and Knox colleges havethe
highest. “Most of our budget Costs
come from equipment, supplies,and
travel We’re losing ground on e»
quipmcnt...0ur wrestling budget is
3900, but we need to buy a new
wrestling mat that costs $2,500.
The point is that you Can’t get
32,500 out of $900.

Pfitsch Continued, “We had a bud»
get iive years ago oi $40,000. This
was cut back to $27,000 at the same
time that inﬂation hit us. We’re
reeling extremely pinched." Grin»
nell lack portable equipment, parti»
cularly in gymnastics While the
Physical Education Complex cost
$2.5 million originally ii is lacking
in seating for contests. due to lack
oi iunds at the time. There have
been payments to Building and Cr-
ounds (or land ﬁlls and snowfences.
Nearly $1,000 was spent ior thepur-
chase oi letter jackets ior varsity
award winners.

There are tentative plans [or build»
ing up the area North or Ioth Ave»
nue where the football field is, The
building would include portable
stands, washrooms, and a press
box. The portable stands could be
used for the track, baseball tennis
and looiball outdoor areas, and then
brought inside to seat 3,000 [or
basketball as well as swimming and
gymnastics.

Every school in the country needs
money. That has becomeawayoiliie
ior colleges and universities. Since
the Midwest Conlerence, Oi which
Grinnell is a member does not
permit giving scholarships, Grin-
nell makes no money irom its ath»

President Glenn Leggett comment»
ed, “The cost of collecting it, (the
money), would be greater than the
amount of money we would take...
The traditional and proper answer
is that we simply have a policy
here which is years and years old
that we do not Charge for admiss-
ion to events. That's one of the
things that’s 50 unique about Grin»

hell. I'm not just talking about
athletics, I’m talking about the con-
certs and everything else. We just
don't,”

Pfltsch says, “Average attendance
is about 1500 per home football
game and 500 ior basketball...About
half of these are not Grinnell stu~
dents...The amount oi money that
Could be made would depend on the
Qualities of the teams we had--
Let's assume that We could make
$1,000. Now, we make maybe $300...
now we just make enough money to
pay the people who take up the
tickets," Avisun notes, “I’m dub~
ious that charging at iootball and
basketball games would bring in
enough money..,They have beenget-
ting in iree ior years; its tradi»
tion. I doubt that it would make a
diﬂerence...the kinds oi money we
need ior athletics are iairly sub»
stantial. They won’t come through
hickels and dimes, to useaphrase."
Grinnell currently gives iree tick-

ets to almost everyone in Sight. .

Money must be raised by the ath-
letic department for athletics. The
Idea that, ‘We’ve always done it
that way,’ just can’t be adhered to.
With the growing prices and needs
for top (light equipment, which the
administration says it wants, re—
quire money. Avison's "nlckels and
dimes” may be small, but every
little bit helps. Grinnell, “try it
(tor one year) you’ll like it."

Trackers limp To Victory

Grinnell's Cross»cDuntry team, led
by Dave Raub, squeaked by both
COe and Cornell Friday to become
Grinnell’s only winning team over
the Weekend With seven runners
suiiering Irom the Grinnell Flu,
the squad picked up help irom two
freshmen, Judah Garber and Clii-

iirst place iinish, Delpertdang pier
ked up second, and Coe collected
third, iourth, and iiith place {ins
ishes. Garber and Clusin came up
with the important sixth and seventh
spots. Sparked by the two lresh»
men, Howland and Damtoit ioughi

hard to take ninth and tinrieenth,
respectively.

When the race had been comple»
ted, it appeared the Pioneers had
lost the meet and a shot at an un»
defeated season. However, when the
score had been tallied Grinnell had
edged Cue by one point and Cornell
by 11.

“If we can run this badly, with our
varsity men sick, against two teams
of that Caliber, and still win,” re~
marked Coach Ray Obermiller,
“then we've got a good team. Raub
really ran well. I'm really excited
about this year's team.”

the Luther Invitational. The iirst
home meet will be the following
week, when Grinnell hosts the Les
Duke invitational.

Dibble-Cowles continued its unde—
ieated season this week with a 19»0
romp over a startled Oii»Campus
team. All the scoring came in the
iirst hall with Dennis Moss hitting
Mitch Schoen three times on long
touchdown passes. Both deienses
toughened up in the second hali
and no points were scored. With
Dennis Moss at Quarterback, Dib-
ble-Cowles is deiinitely the team
to beat Moss’ running and passing
ability coupled with the iact that
the team has won two games by
iorieit, is going to make them dis
