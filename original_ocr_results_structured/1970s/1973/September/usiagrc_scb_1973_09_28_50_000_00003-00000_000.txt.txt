cities participating in a program
to speed recovery and return oi
stolen bicycles. »
Police Chief Bill Peters says the
new system, which is currently one
ly partially operational, will allow
all participating departments to have
access to a central list 0! stolen
bicycles, listed by serial number.

participating departments include»

Des Moines, Ames, Marshalltown,
Boone, Fort Dodge, and Iowa City,
The Amos Police Department will
act as a central clearing house for
stolen bike reports, receiving daily
listings tram participating depart
ments and giving out intormation
irom these listings.

“Eventually we will go to computer
for this," said Peters, “and this
will make it similar to the way we
handle stolen cars." ‘
Peters adds that he heard aboutthe
program during a recent meet

ing or the Iowa AssociationotChiets ,
of Police, where he indicated his
interest in participating.

Part oi the tunding tor the new»
program is coming through Pro-
ject Arrow, the sometimesvcontro-
versial statewide program designed
to taster cooperation between lowa .,
police departments. ‘
He emphasized that bike owners ,
must know their serial numbers in
order tor the new program to be
ettective. ' ‘
“We'd like them to register the
bike, but even it they do and es-.‘
pecially it they don't, they should
write down the make, model, color, .
and most important, the serial mim-
her or thelr bicycle. Without the
serial number, there isn't even any i
point in checking,” he noted. ‘
