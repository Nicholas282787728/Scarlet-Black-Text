lin D. Roosevelt, has arranged for

The former Lend-Lease Adminisr
trator and Secretary oi Commerce

’ough born in sioux City, he lived for
many years in Grinnell and attended

A service was held at 10 am. this
morning, at Hazelwood Cemetery.
Participants were the Rev, John C,
McCallum, pastor of the Grinnell
United Methodist Church, and Dr.
Glenn Leggett, president oiGrinnell
College, who gave a brief address.

David; a granddaughter, Mrs. la-
mes Griffen and her two children,
Allison and David. Arrangements
were under the direction of Smith
Funeral Home here.

Leggett said, in part, "Consider
the era when Harry Lloyd Hopkins
was called to his most impossible
t.sks. The country was at a stand,

ill, stricken and chiﬂed by an
economic fate few could understand.
America was a people that could
hardly think, much less move tor
wards recovery and health. The
retreat to fear and hopelessness
proceeded like a vast reflex action
across the cities and farms, and
it seemed America’s destiny was,
ending in the stilled factories, the
untilled fields, the workless mil-
lions, the populace now poor be,
'nd its most disturbing dreams.

Bury Hopkins Here

and strong men cameiorth "among
them, Harry Hopkins. They could
think and act and prevail. No one
who is not a pragmatist can sucr
ceed in the kind of work Harry
Hopkins was called to do. Tough,
knowledgeable, resourceiul, tena~
cious .. yes, all oi these, but also
possessed of the Vision and sense
of humanity that made his tough
ness and tenacity vehicles for a
better state of mankind.

Surely. it would be gratifying, for
those of us who are citizens of this
place, if we could say that this man,
Harry Hopkins, was shaped and rea-
lized by the elements in this land—
scape, in these green and plea-
sant acres, in the schools here, and
in the lecturerhalls of the College.
We do make that claim, of course,
because where greatness walks, its
path becomes a legacy of those who
walk there too,

Harry Hopkins began his career
as a social worker in New York and
in 1931 became head of the relief
organization set up in that state
by the then Governor Franklin D,
Roosevelt. .

In 1933 when Roosevelt took off-
ice as President, Hopkins came to
Washington to work on relief prob»
lems for the Federal government.
He headed the Federal Emergency
Relief Agency, Civil Works Admins
istration, and Works Progress Ad
ministration,

As friend and adviser, Hopkins
served President Rooseveltdirectly
in many missions on both the.na-
tional and international levels and
was considered one of the most in-
ﬂuential public figures of his time.

Chile Revolution Discussed

by Deborah Redman

The recent coup in Chile was the
topic of a presentation held at the
South Lounge Tuesday night. Appr
roxl'mately 125 students came to
hear Thomas Niehaus and Richard
McLaughlin oi the Spanish Depart-
ment, and Rob Ramer of the Soo-
ialist party discuss the events
leading up to and following Allende’s
demise,

The panel discussed the history
behind the coup. A fact not gener-
ally known is that a coup is a rare
event in Chile, Unlike many Latin
American countries, the last coup
to take place in Chile was in 1925.
Since then, there has been a succ-
ession of democratically elected
presidents. each Serving his entire
six-year term.

Salvador Allende was not new to

the political scene. He had trieu
repeatedly ior the presidency, and
when he finally was elected in 1970,
he began to move Chile in the dir-
ection of democratic socialism. Al-
though Allende did much to nationa-
1119 the copper mines. and aiiect
agrarian reforms, he perhaps did
not suiticlently concern himseltwith
the welfare of the large middle class
oi Chile. The social origin of the
military is largely irom this class,
and it was the military that over-
threw the Allende administration
last week.

The panel members pointed out
American complicity in recent Chi,
lean history. The United States Go»
vernment was not pleased when All,
ende came to power, and it boycot-
ted all Chilean copper. since the
copper mines represent Chile's

tonne; of Cdllc‘m Relations)

most important industry, this boy
cott aggravated theecnnomic pro-
blems Allende tried to solve.

What does this coup mean? Nie-
haus stated that the Allendegovernr
ment “offered hope to other Latin
American countries.” Under Ally
ende's rule, there was "no torture,

no political prisoners, and total‘

political freedom,” Since the mili—
tary junta took‘ over, there have
been reports, admittedly unconfirm»
ad, of 10,000 deaths. Political pris»
oners are being held at the National
Stadium in Santiago, One American
couple reported 400~500 deaths by
machine gun fire.

He added that there should he ens
ough iuel for the College unless there
is an extremely severe winter. in
that case, he said, ”the real crunch
would hit sometime in February."
However, Hawn expressed concern
over the fuel situation in future
years Northern Natural Gas, why
ich supplies the College with nature
a1 'gas for the dualrtuel Heating
Plant, has informed the College
that all natural gas will be cut off
at an unspecified point in the next
two, three, or four years,

iuel oil consumption will jump to
more than 600,000 gallons yearly--
and there is no indication of howthe
College will obtain the additional
fuel.

“You probably know more about
that part of the fuel situation than
we do,“ he said. “You're in the
news business."
