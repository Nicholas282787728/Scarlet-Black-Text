FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 1973

lllness‘ Rampant-

by John Wylie

A still undiagnosed gastrorintesti- ,
nal illness had affected almost one—
sixth of the Grinnell campus by late
Thursday
A Scarlet and Black telephone sur-
vey of all hall presidents and house
coordinators showed 209 students
and resident advisers ill as of
Thursday noon, although only one
student was confined to the infir-
mary.

Of the 209, 42 live in North Cams
pus dormitories, 148 in South Cam-
pus dormitories, and 19 in off-
campus college owned houses. No
co-op house residents had been
affected.

Hardest hit was Haines Hall, which
reported 31 ill, Next were Mears
and Main, each reporting 24 sick.
Conversely, Cowles Hall reported
no cases as of Thursday.

State Health
Officials of the Iowa State Ller

partment of Health arrived on the
Campus -Thursday morning to begin
tests aimed at diagnosing the ill-
ness and determining its cause.
By early afternoon, the team had
interviewed 50 students about the
onset, nature, and severity or the
illness. Cultures were also taken
for later laboratory analysis,
Health Center officials reported
that students were still coming in
sick Thursday afternoon, but that the
symptoms of nausea, diarrhea, and
fever appeared milder than they had
been earlier in the week.

students were given medication
to help combat the nausea and dine
rrhea, and ere sent to their resir
dences with instructions to rest and
remain on a soft or liquid diet.

Cyclone Financial Woes Continue

Grinnell’s yearbook is in serious
financial straits, although prospects
appear brighter that publication oi
the annual will be possible this
year.

The Cyclone is presently operating
under a debt of between $1800 and
$2000, and college officials had said
the book could no longer be pub.
lished as an officially sanctioned
volume unless the yearbook stall
found money independent of the Cos
liege to cover the debt,

However, a proposal made recently
by SGA President Scott Well that
money be advanced by the College
to cover the debt appears to offer
a possible solution.

Under the plan, the College would
advance money to cover the lan
debt, and would then be repaid by
the Cyclone over a five year per
iod.

president Glenn Leggett saidWedr
nesday that the plan was “the most
sensible proposal" he had yetheard
ior saving the Cyclone.

He added that he would make a fir
nal decision on the matter after the
plan was placed in written iorm.

Printing Bill

The Cyclone’s problems Stem from
the book’s iailure to generate enough
operating revenue to Cover capital .
acquisitions, salaries and ongoing
expenses, and printing.

Thus, the yearbook spent its enr
tire 1972—73 allocation and income
heiore the bill for printing the book
was received,

When Student Auditor Mark Wale
derhaus received the bill, which
totaled more than $4000, he was
able to pay only about half.

The Cyclone has been in debt to
Sutherland Printing Company in
Montezuma since late May because
of this miscalculation.

Glenn Sigmund, editorrdesignate ol
the 1973-74 yearbook, expressed
confidence in a recent interview that
there will be a yearbook.

Sigmund has already held a staff
meeting, and tentative plans for
the yearbook are proceeding.

A Cyclone official estimates that
500 copies of the [372773 book have
been sold at a cost oi as each,
A limited number of copies are
still available,

Boards See
Emotion, TV

by John Turnbull
Not attending: Gates, Dibble

At this week's meeting of the
Joint Boards, SGA showed some of
the emotional spark that made their
predecessors so iniamous.

The first of the emotional outs
bursts came with the Social Co-
ordinator’s Report. Celestine Blo-
omfield, Social Coordinator, said
quite bluntly that she did not want
to make any more routine reports
to the Joint Boards and that she
did not feel that any other member
of the committee would be'quali—
fied to answer questions about the
committee’s performance.

As she repeatedly emphasized, ”I
am the Social’Coo’rdinator.” The is~
sue was dissolved when Scott Weil
told her to make weekly reports in
person.

Not long after, Denise lverson, co-
ordinator oi the campus carnival
television iund, reported that only
four halls had shown an active in-
terest in setting up booths at the
carnival; Younkers, Gates, Rawson
and Norris.

lverson had been working quite
steadily on the carnival throughout
the week and she was ready to call
it units or just have a private car»
nival for those interested. It was
eventually agreed to postpone the
event until September 28, when more
complete arrangements could be
made.

The other part of the Television
Crusade, the lottery, is already
under way. Fifty cent tickets went
on sale at Cowies Tuesday and were
expected at Quad Thursday. Receipts
as oi Wednesday night just covered
the anticipated expenses. Once the
money comes in, consideration will
begin of two major questions: what
will determine the priorities of
T.V. repair, and who will be res-
ponsible for keeping the television
fund operative; SGA, the Adminis—
tration or popular student support?

This last question is also perti-
nent to current funding of KDIC’s
teietype, There is some $250 in
outstanding bills that would conti-
nue the use of the AP teletype
through September 29. However,
SGA postponed by two weeks any
action on the payments.

During that time, it is hoped that
an agreement can be reached with
the Administration for, if not imm»
ediate, at least future funding of
KDIC expenses. There is a slight
atmosphere of hope for Dean Waik-
er has agreed to “consider a pro—
posal for yearly funding by the
college."
