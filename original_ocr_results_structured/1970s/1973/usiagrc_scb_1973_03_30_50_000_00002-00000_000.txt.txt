some of the halls chosen. Many
changes, however, were simply to

done," Ms. Bloomlield pointed out
that there had been no conspiracy
to choose the better rooms on cam-
pus. The House Presidents, how—
ever, remained skeptical ahout the
matter and defeated the proposal
{or specilic rooms by a 77873 vote.
Instead, they voted to implement
immediately a procedure which was
originally to be effective [or the
74-75 school year. This procedure
consists of three steps: 1) The
Black Student Housing Committee
determines how many rooms ofwhat
type are needed. Juniors and sen-
iors are guaranteed singles if they
wish. (in the regular room draw
nearly all juniors and seniors are
able to get singles it they wish,
so this represents no special pri-
vilege), 2) A committee of two
black students, two students from the
Housing Committee, and a person
from the Office of the Dean of Stu-
dent affairs in Consultation with the
house president will decide what
rooms will be blocked off, and, a)
black students will draw from those
rooms which were blocked off.

This motion passed 13—0-1.

mittee met later in the evening,
however, and rejected the Joint
