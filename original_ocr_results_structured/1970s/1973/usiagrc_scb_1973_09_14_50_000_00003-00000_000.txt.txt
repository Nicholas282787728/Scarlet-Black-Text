Committee All Should Watch

by Ellen Yacknin

Important notice to all experienced
and novice committeeewatchers:
One of the most important commit»
tees to keep your eyes on this year
will be the Subcommittee on Educa—
tional Policies, otherwise known as
the AlleCOllege EPC. If all goes
as planned, the EPC will be recomr
mending some innovative and radical
changes in the academic sphere oi
Grinnell College.

on Saturday morning, September
8, the All-College EPC met for
the first time this year. Although
the meeting was more oi an organ
izational one than anything else,
suggestions were put iorth about
what issues the EPC should work
on in the coming weeks. Among
other concerns, the current grads
ing system will be reexamined by
the Committee. One alternative to
be discussed will be the availabilr
ity of a number at grading options
from which a student can choose
to be graded.

Brad Clompus, a senior trom Ph-
iladelphia who is not a member oi
the EPC, has submitted a proposal
for the establishment of a Center
for Independent Learning. The Clan-
ter,would concern itself with the
administration of all aspects of in—
dependent and innovative learning
programs at Grinnell.

Soon to he Submitted by another
nonrmember, Ellen Yacknin, is a
proposal for an interim semester
program at Grinnell Such a pro-
gram, in which the two semesters

would be separated by a month in
which every student has the option
oi working on a proiect oi his/her
choice, was discussed brielly last
year The EPC hopes to develop a
ieasible plan and submit it to the
appropriate bodies ior approval bee
tore the year is over.

Finally, Dean Waldo Walker, Cor
mmittee Chairman, proposed that
the Committee concern itseli with
the establishment oi some kind of
program to develop and improve
writing skills among Grinnellians.
Such a program already exists to
help develop reading skills, and
has been proved very successful.
But the All~Coliege EPC will be

- interesting to observe not onlv for

what it does, but for what is done

this separation would be a realise
tic step towards making Grinnell
the complete community which, in
theory, it already is.

Members of the All-College EPC
who will be working to resulvesome
of these problems are: Dean Waldo
Walker, Chairman; Assistant Dean
James Hamilton; Mr Philip Kintr
her, Mr. Robert Voertman, Mr.
Sandy Molfett; Mr. Don Smith; and
Mr. Robert Grey. Student members
include: Scott Well, SGA President;

with it. One of the overriding con-
cerns oi the SGA Cabinet this year
is the academic power oi the stu-
dents. It is the Cabinet‘s hope that
before the end oi the year, the Col-
lege will realize that it cannot trr
uly claim to exist ior the benetit
of the students unless those studs
ents are able to share in the de-
cisions made about their educational
program. One way to work towards
fulfillment of this goal would be
to separate the AlleCollege EPC
irom the Executive Council, at wh-
ich the EPC is presently merely
a sub—committee. To accomplish

luPour: lady Behind The Ads

For the first time in Grinnell’s
history an loWa State Employment
Service office has opened. The oil-
ice, which is located on the main
ﬂoor of the Veterans Memorial
Building, is staffed by Jacque La
Pour.

La Pour, a graduate ol‘ Northeast
Missouri State University with a
BA. in sociology, urges Grinnell
students to come down and apply
for part-time work.

“In the past it has been hard to
find work for students because of
their hours. But two people could
work together, one covering the
hours the other couldn't make,”
La Pour pointed out. "We have
plenty of openings. The employers
are very cooperative."

La Pour codes her job-seekers
according to their experience and
interests. often if a person has
only done waitress work, for exam-
ple, this is the only job she iinds

open to her, But i try to find jobs
that will interest my applicants as
well as Suit their experience.”

She is also familiar with govern-
ment training programs and can
assist people needing help in these
areas. La Pour has provided a”Job
Bank" telephone line and is able to
place people all over Iowa and in
neighboring states quickly

She said she feels thatthere should
be plenty of openings ior students
during vacation periods. "During
summer we have lots of job openr
ings in construction, and the store
keepers need help during Christ»
mas,” she said. La Pour added that
students staying in Grinnell during
vacations should contact her if they
need a job.

The response to the Iowa State
Employment Service has been very
good, La Pour remarked. Her main
problem has been finding enough
applicants.

Socialist local Formed

Students of the college community
have formed the first local of the
Socialist Party USA. in the state
of Iowa.

Named local chairman was Jim
Demopulos oi Malcom and a former
student. anal secretary named was
Andy Mckibben.

In one of their first actions the
local issued a statement concern,
ing the overthrow of the Allende
government in Chile.

The group called for no shows
of solidarity, but asked all to note
the results of capitalism. "We do
ask you to yoin us in the tight against
the destructive profit system.”

In their original informational
meeting, the group discussed the
various splits that had developed
in the Socialist parties in the Unis
ted States in the last few years and
differentiated many of the varying
ideologies.

Many students felt 'vthat Grinnell

course oiierings didn't adequately
cover areas of socialist thought and
that perhaps a study group could
help individuals formulate and clar—
ify their thinking on socialism.

Many members oi the group ex-
pressed a basic dissatisfaction with
the Peace Lollecuve as being spor-
adic in its operation. it was suggest—
ed that a socialist local could serve
an Onrgoing educational and action
function.

Bill Eaar remarked that “thereare
probably as many deiinitions of
socialism as there are people in
the room." In stating his view of
socialism as “being the democratic
control oi industry and means of
production," Baar excluded China
and the 11.5 S R irom being socias
list countries.

Eaar felt that the Socialist Party
U.S.A. could be a viable political
alternative to other options avails

Grinnell’s rally wagon is aging...and is beingallowed to make iewe
trips to ierry students away from Grinnell.

Wheels Grind To A Halt

by Dee Dee Goldie
“The college simply can’t be in
the business oi giving students tr-
ansportation for pleasure," said
Jean King. assistant professor of
physical education. She was refer-
ring to a recent decision limiting
the use oi the collegerowned Rally

' Wagon to active recreational pur-

poses.
“We were told this year that the
van would not be replaced. It’s in
terrible Condition; the windows are
cracked, the doors don't open, Ano-
ther problem is the cost of gas. I
hate to think what it costs to run
that van a mile,” she stated. She
added that it Was Just too expen-
sive to repair it students are using
it for other activities.

in the past, the Rally Wagon was
available for non-recreational use
by students. It was often used for
trips to the Amana Colonies. Now,
however, students will have to find
alternate methods oitransportation.
Chris Broiidwell, director of the

Student Recreation Committee, ma» .

intained that the Rally Wagon was
originally given ior Committee use
only. The Physical Education de-

Approximately 18 students part

Mayflower Home, and an apartment.
In a survey taken at the end of last
year, it was found that people par-

as desires to work in town, wishes
to help others, lack of their own
grandparents, and the need oi elds

This year’s program aims at in-
creasing the number of participants
in order to give each grandparent
a visiting grandchild. Meetings oi
all the grandchildren will be held
occasionally to discuss problems
and progress.

Broadwell said, “Even the P.E

In that sense it would still be av
ailable for student use.” He add-i
that when students were using th

recreation committee. “We had [-
cut down on the use of the wagon so
that we could maintain i When it
goes, the Student Recreation Com-
mittee will really be in trouble,”
he Said.

Broadwell recommended that stu-
dents go to the Student Coordina~

planned which requires transportae
tion. However, Joe Genereux, Stu»
dent Coordinator, said thathe reall
saw no transportation available to
