AP Newswire Comes To KDIC

by John Wylie

After four months of delays, pro-
mises, and more delays, KDIC'S
Associated Press teletype was fin-
ally installed on Monday,

After almost a year without news
service, the station last semester
budgeted money for a news wire. Sta-
tion Manager John Seeley imr
mediately contacted AP, United
Press international, and Reuters
News Service about a radio news
teletype.

By October 1, with offers from all
three firms in hand, Seeley decided
to contract with UPI for news Ser-
vice, The wire service promised the
station that installation would be
completed by October 27.

October 27 came and went, but there
was no sign of a teietype, when seVr
eral calls fromSeeley toDesMoines
brought no results, he sent John
Wylie to Des Molnes in an effort
to track down the problem.

Cheryl Arvidsoh,UPl’sDesMoines
Bureau Manager.promisedtliatser-
vice would be inaugurated by Nov-
ember 3-rin time for Election Day
coverage and also in time to meet
an FCC guideline which named the
station as the primary Emergency
Broadcast System station for Grinr

hell.

However, Seeley was notified the
next day that there would beanother
delay. The blame for the delay was
placed on the telephone company,
which must install the Des Moines
to Grinnell Circuits forteletypesere
vice. Blame was shifted back and
forth between Northwestern Bell
Telephone Company, which serves
Des Moines, and the General Tele-
phone Company of the Midwest,
which serves Grinnell.

”Incredible!” is all Seeley could
say about the events ot the next
three weeks Each telephone com-
pany insisted that the other was at
fault, while the station remained
without news service.

Wylie finally made a third trip to
Des Moines in an effort to find the
true source of theproblem.Througn
Ms. Arvidson, he was put in touch
with Al Knudson, manager ofinter-
company relations for the Bell SySr
tem in Des Moines.

Knudsen ended the game of“tele»
type football", admitting that the
problem lay totally with the Bell
system's lack of capacity for new
lines in Des Moines. He estimated
that it would be at least the first
part of February before adequate

THREE LEVELS OF SHOPS

capacity for a UPI line from Des
Moines to Grinnell would exist,

since the problem lay in getting a
signal from Des Molnes toGrinnell,
Wylie next asked about the possir
bility oispiitting the signal of AP’s
existing line to Grinnell, which
serves KGRNrAM.

Knudsen agreed that this would be
technically feasible, and the station
completed arrangements with the
Associated Press the next day for
news service,

Time needed for technical equip»
ment to be shipped from New York
to Grinnell accounts forthe remain-
ing delay and the January installar
tion date.

Although the new news service is
currently being fundedoutofthestar
lion’s operating budget, KDIC is
working with the College Develop
ment ouice in seeking a more per
manent source of funds. The most
likely source is a corporate grant,
similar to grants which allowed UPI
service for KDIC when it first began
operations and, colors that, for an
earlier Campus station, KGRW.

AT LAST!

Wall Addresses Convention

Joseph F. Wall, Outgoing Deanofthe Collegeand Parker Professor
of History was the principal speaker at the convention of the As-
sociation of American Colleges held in San Francisco, California
January 14—17.

The theme or the session was “Autonomy, Authority and Account.
ability: Conflicting Forces in Higher Education."

“in the faur years thatIhave beenan academic dean and in making
frequent trips to other campuses as an examiner for the North
Central Association where I have visited classes and talked with
students,” said Wall, “1 am convinced that there is a formidable

amount of bad teaching going on in this country,”
He recommended that not only should good teaching be rewarded

through promotions, granting of tenure. and merit salary increases,
but also that bad teaching should bepunishedby denying instructors
these benefits in each instance of unsatisfactory performance,
Wall also observed that “greater and more imaginativeuse (should)
be made of part—time faculty, not for the menial work where they
are now too frequently used, but to bring unusual expertise and
curricular variety to the campus.

“Often," he said, "therearevaluablepotentialrteaching resources
available within any community, and though these persons may not
have all the traditionally proper academic pedigrees, they can
through their experiences makegreat contributionsto the classroom.
And with only one or two cla ses to offer, no pressure for put)-
licatlon and no need to parti ipate actively in the bureaucratic
structure of the college, they have the time, energy, and the en—
thusiasm to spend upon their students."

Wall further suggested that colleges and universities should
discourage summer or year»round teaching assignments on the
part of regular taculty.

“Let it be known to the faculty that summer vacation is the time
for the individual's own research, for Catching up on the literature
in his field and for thinking and preparing for his courses for the
following term," he said,

Pointing out that student course evaluations can be an important
part ”in the determination of personnel questions,” Wall called
for the application of college resources and expertise into the
preparation of such evaluations.

Finally, he said, institutions of higher education should “put
sufficient college resources into developing a meaningful program
to promote and encourage effective college teaching. This could in-
volve late summer seminars, the taping and recordingof classroom
sessions, released time for a portion of the faculty each year,
classroom Visitations, and the guidance and counseling of new
faculty.

“The spirit of any college is housed in the classroom, and both
teacher and student are its sustenance, If eilller fails or loses
interest, the spirit will surely depart,”
