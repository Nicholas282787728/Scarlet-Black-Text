The game against Knox iorthird placeinthe tournament
was a turnaround. the pioneers madeaoilo tree throws
but connected on only as percent (ruin the iield. The
Knox team controlled the hoards during the second hali,
and only another 20-point ellort by Bailey prevented
the game from being a runaway. This game also
marked the iirst starting appearance for guard John
Haigh, who scored 14.

The second game against Knox was much the same
story, with the lapse coming in the lirst halt rather
than the second. The Siwashers led 40-24 at intere
