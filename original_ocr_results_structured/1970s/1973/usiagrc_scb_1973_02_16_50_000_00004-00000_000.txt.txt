Weil For President

This past week three SGA Presidential candidates have been
going through the annual rite of the SGA campaign. Seasoned
observers have become familiar with theagenda: promises
are made on mimeographed sheets nailed to dormitorydoors,
the term “student power” fills the air, and glorious general—
ities about improved social and academic life float around
during South Lounge discussions between candidates.

It happens every year. Sometimes we get a great SGA Presi-
dent and sometimes we get a poor one, but in any case soon
after the election we have forgotten all about it and forgotten
all about SGA. And after a furious start the new officers settle
down to the business of bureaucracy and administration.

This year, ,however, we believe that there is a candidate
in the field who may not fit into the usual pattern, and as a
result we firmly support Scott Weil for the position of Student
Government Association President.

Weil subscribes to a philosophy quite different from that of
previous “student power” advocates, who emphasized getting
student representation on committees and tried to obtain student
input into the process by which important decisions are made.

In Weil’s View of decision-making, the college community
is divided into five groups: the Administration, the faculty,
the Trustees, the alumni, and the students. The determination
of policy takes place through the interaction of these five
groups. With proper organization a unified student body, which
is the largest effective group among the five, may be able
to put pressure on the others to follow student interests.

Consonant with his theory of power, Weil believes that student
government requires a strong central executive authority
which spends time advocating student interests to other power
groups rather than quibbling over jurisdictions and maneu—
vering in inside power plays. Much ofthebureaucracy of student
government can be eliminated, he believes, by a refusal of
SGA to cooperate in doing the“busywork" oithe Administration.
And with a possible elimination of student salaries for SGA
officials the organization can concentrate on applying its re-
sources to programs which benefit the entire student body
rather than letting student funds be consumed by the internal
workings of SGA‘ itself. ‘

But the central issue to student government, Weil believes,
is what he calls “academic rights.” If there is any area of
the college which affects students more than the others this
is surely the one, and thus it is precisely in the area of
academics where the power of an organized student govern—
ment can be felt most effectively. By advocating such student-
supported moves as a relnstitute of credit/erase, a liberal
policy towards independent prejects, and an organized and ef-
fective student input into the hiring and firing of professors,
Weil believes that student government can substantially affect
the academic conditions under which we live here.

The lowekey, committee-oriented, bureaucratic approach to
student government may be over. With effective, responsive,
and imaginative leadership theorganization mayyet be shocked
out of its doldrums. Having Scott Weil as SGA President may
not guarantee that, but it would be a giant stride in the right
direction.

Woods: Valentine For Hamilton

To the Editors:

Because I had forgotten the date
and suffered a few of many and
various setbacks which are the salt
in the coffee of academic life, I
found myself in the unenviahle pos-
ition of having to turn in my apv
plication for an independent l4 hours
late. It was denied, of course, but
that is not the point of this letter.

I realize that the administration,
in its infinite wisdom, was merely
shielding a professor from an over»
load of work he was not bright en-
ough to guard himself from, and i
do not protest that fact that I am
now sitting on fourteen pages of Wat-
for computer programming, nor the
fact that the dean’s office, after
last semester's overload, sat quiet
and did nothing about this semester
until after work had begun on this
semester’s independent planning,
nor that the new independent pole
icy is so arbitrary as to make moc»
kery of the administration’s intelliv
gence, nor the fact that 32,000 is
a bit expensive for lzecredits, nor
the fact that both my advisor and
I know that my independent would-
n’t overload him, but that it was
judged and denied by a person who
has little or no experitse on the
subject.

No, I do not protest this injury.

1 am, by nature, a peaceful per-
son, but when I protest, I protest
with in energy that shouldn’t be
wasted on the above grievances.

What I do protest is the manner
in which it died. It Could not die
in an afmosphcr‘c of mutual re
spect. It had to be crucified. I
received a short, neat form letter
telling me to forsake all hope, but
in-a corner in a noxious scrawl
there was a codlcil from one of
our more winsome deans informing
me that my petitioning note for the
independent had been, and I quote,
“unpersuasive.”

l was prepared for the loss of
the independent, but not for this
graphic molestation.

After having the law promulgated
down to us from on high in mid»
semester, no less, I see no rea-
son to accept insult as well as inv
jury. Everything would have been
beautiful if only I were allowed to
lick my wounds with some modi»
cum of dignity.

I, C. Woods

P. S. After researching this letter,
I find that had I not signed this let
tel" said Dean would have had no
way (other than my writing style)
of tracking me down. He’s written
other notes of this nature.

Silverman: Photography As Art

To the Editors:

It is a disappointing fact that the
existence of photography as an art
has been denied or ignored by Grin-
nell College. This lamentable State
of affairs is manifest in the sch-
ool’s placement of its only photo-
graphy course in the Communica—
tions department, and the availa~
bility of three darkrooms for the
exclusive use of the sciencedepart-
ment. The exclusiveness of those
three darkrooms would be under-
standable were there other dark-
room: available for general use.
However, ofthe other two darkrooms
on campusI one is reserved fol-those
working for the Scarlet kBlack, and
the other is restricted from general
use from Sundaytill’l‘hursdaybyMs.
Kent’s photography course.

The placement of that coursein the
Communications department be-
trays the administration’s insensi»
thity to the artistic potential of the
medium of photography. Perhaps
they would have a poetry course
taught by the Speech department.
This is not to say that a speech
professor might not be able toteach
a poetry course. But to make him
do so would indicate a certain lack
of respect for poetry while ineffi-
ciently using the teaching strength
of the speech professor.

Thus, there is a lack of respect
for photography revealed in the ad-
ministration’s placement of the

Cocks: lhe Grinnell Conformist Culture

To the Editors:

Ira Aromn‘s recent letter, and the
response it drew from Misses re:
ters and Hughes, have at last brou»
ght into the open a problem that,
more than any other, is the cause
of anxiety, depression, and bore-
dam on campus There is, simply,
damn little romance at Grinnell

The fault, however, does not lie
with the females as a group or,
the males as a group. It may sure
prise Misses Peters and Hughes to
learn that many of the men at this
school have come to the same Cone
clusions about Grinnell women that
they arrived at regarding men

The problem is Grinnell itself, and
we are all responsible, We’ve gone
too far. The enthusiastic pursuit
of an improved society has led tozfn
indiscriminate selection and rejece
tion of values Grillnell has become
the epilome of conformist culture
We have found the Solution to all of
life’s problems in the reduction of
nearly everyone and everything to
a bland, non»conflicting sameness
It seems that I've heard the same
complaint every weekend for three
years
“Jesus, going out with a Grinncll
girl is just like gomg out with tho
guys: For God’s sake, if l wanted

to go out with my buddys that'swhat
I would have done!”

I have no doubt that a great many
girls feel the same way. In our
headlong drive for liberation in all
areas, we have removed those exe
quisite little differences between the
sexes that fuel romance. The mys-
tery, the nervousness, the formality,
the anticipation, {ill of these are in
large part gone . and withthem much
of the enjoyment of sex,

It is no news that sex without r0-
mance ultimately becomes means
ingless and/or degrading. Unfortunr
ately, it is also common knowledge
that, lll many cases, Grinnell has
managed to achieve both We are
very free at Grinnell — and very
equal. It is a shame that so many
are also very bored and very frus-
trated.

Wile Dean Walker goes forth in
Search Of the cause of the Grin~
nell Blues he is likely to hear
a great deal about ”adminisiaiive
unresponsiveness'-' on the “general
ineffectiveness ofthe American edu-
cational experience ” However,
these bankrupt terms have little to
do with the dark side of Grinnell.
At the risk of being branded a faSA
Clst, reactionary, male chauvinisi
etc., I would like to respectfully
submit the following proposals for

consideration by the campus com-
munity.

1. Reduce the number of Co—ed
housing units. Living in a Co-ed
dorm is like having 50 brothers
and sisters. It is not a sister that
I need at present. I already have
one and she does nicely. (Not wish-
ing to be overly vulgar, I’d like
to lodge a protest against Co-ed
johns. These devilish creations are
not so much shocking or embarrass-
ing as they are merely stupid. Ro-
mance can endure no greater trial
than to be trapped in a stall next
to the beloved.)

2. Cut back on College-sponsored
weekend activities. Weekend nights
here are insane. Entertainment has
become a force-fed, full time oc-
cupation.

3. Expunge the term “meaningful
relationship” from the vocabulary.
More genuine meaningful relation-
ships have been killed by these two
words than any Cased john on cam-
pus.

4. Girls, it is notnecessary to mim-
ic men to demonstrate that you are
equal to them. This may be a little
hard for some liberals to swallow
but, difference does not imply in-
ferlority.

5. Bring back the Waltz.

Bob Cocks

course in the Communications de~
partment. Why they should not reSr
pect photography as an art is beyond
my comprehension, as there is cer-
tainly no reason for it. The photo—
graphs of Alfred Stiegletz and Paul
Strand alone are substantial proof
that photography can be an art equal
in importance to any other art.

Although the importance of the use
of photography by the science def
pertinent cannot be denied; its re~
lationship to science relies only on
the mere process of photography
to reporduce with minute accuracy
whatever is before the camera. To
consider the process and ignore its
potential is like considering the abil»
ity to write (knowing how to make
words form the alphabet by means
of inkfnled pen and paper) and ig-
noring the writing of poetry.

In a recent conversation I had with
Dean Hamilton regarding the avail~
ability of darkroom space on came
pus, he expressed a need for dark,
room “hobby space”. This attitude
is indicative of a misguided state
of mind. It is misguided for two
reasons: Dean Hamilton’s labeling
of any additional darkroom space
on campus as ”hobby space” re-
veals his misunderstanding of the
nature of photography, and of the
nature of the problem involved. The
problem is the college’s ignorance
of photography’s potential as an
art. I invite Dean Hamilton and
anyone else who lacks this Com-
prehension of the artistic potential
of photography to resolve their ige
horance, and hope that they will
come to their senses before anOr
ther class of students has to be
blinded by their lack of insight,
I am at your disposal for any ad-
vice or assistance.

Glaser: Platform

To the Editors:

Harry Derderian’s desire for di'av
matic change at Grinnell became eve
ident to me when I read his plat-
form which he released on Monday
morning. '

However, when I read Scott Weil’s
platform which he releasedtwodays
later I was shocked and dismayed
because Weil has apparently copied
many of Derderian’s basic pro—
posals. Some ol:Well’s proposals
are even worded very similarly to
Derderian’s.

We need creative and original lead-
ership. If Scott Weil's platform is
any indication of his ability to think
creatively and originally Ifeel one
should question his candidacyforthe
SGA presidency.

Kissane. Praise
To the Editors:

Probably a word of praise from a
faculty person is not quite the reac-
tion you’re looking for, but I hope
you won't take it as a sign you must
be doing something wrong. In any
case, I found the last issue of the
55:8 closer to the real thing than
any I’ve seen in some time (but
I‘ll admit I don't always look very
hard).

The insert on faculty wives was an
admirable idea; and--although the
letters are not your doing (except
that you sometimes print some you
shouldn’t)--the one on the demise
of the Abominable Snow Sculpture
was deft and witty, and that from
the two girls showed spirit. Even the
photograph of the Marine recruiter
contemplating a couple of students
had some of the eloquence of an in-
splred cartoon.

The news stories seemed unusually
thorough and informative, and there
were several other pleasing things
one could mention Thank you.
