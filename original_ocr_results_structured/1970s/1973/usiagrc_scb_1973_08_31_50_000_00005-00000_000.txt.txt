For those of you who do not know,
Risk is a game played on a world
map which pays periunotory lip ser-
vice to actual national boundaries.
The world is divided into 42 count»
ries. First the countries are allott-
ed by lot among the players, Then
armies are fielded wherever the
armchair generals Wish them, Then
the Battle is joined. The player who
wipes out all his opponents and con-
quers every country by means oi
tactic and countertactic, threat and
counterthreat, coup and counter-
coup, rape and counterrape, is the
victor. The victor gets the vast
satisiaction of knowing, as he nur—
ses his sour dice arm, that the five
hours he spent marching imaginary
armies across the iertile steppes
of the Ukraine, the burning bush of
the Congo, the gray tundra oi Si-
beria were the most gratiiying he’d
ever lived. What is to blame for this?

Capitalism!

Forty years ago, in the days oi the
Depression, a lascist pig corpora-
tion named Parker Eros, came out
with a game called Monopoly. This
game, a finger-exercise in Capital-
ist Fascism, taught children that
ruthlessness and moneyrgrubbing
would ultimately make them mem-
bers oi the upper classes. These
children grew up unhappy, corrupt
and decadent, but before their chil-
dren could totally repudiate their
fascist values, as they surely would
have, Parker Eros. came out with
another game. This time the theme
was not material gain. The standard
of living had increased to a start-
ling degree. No, now the lesson was
to be in imperialism. And so Risk
was born.

No longer did the capitalist State
need youth to build hotels, pass Go,
and Walk on the Boardwalk. NOW the
Capitalistrpig state needed running-
dog lackey generals to lead their
wars ol imperialism, especially th-
ose against Russia and China, (You
get the most armies ior holding
down that sector) I suggest how,
iuture parents oi America, that you
remove these paramilitary toys fr-
om the possibility of contaminating
your children, BURN RISK!!! BURN

Best Of The Hot Box Reviewed

by Frank stoler

This week I’ll give a few short
reviews on some of the albums
in KDIC’S HOT Box The HOT
BOX THIS WEEK contains over
iorty albums, and these are some
of the better ones.

”Walkin’ One it Only" might be
the right phrase to describe MARIA
MULDAUR, and is also a cut on
her first solo album. Having been
a member oi the Even Dozen Jug
Band (other members included Steve
KatZ, Joshua Rifkin, Stefan Gross-
man and John Sebastian), Jim Kwes-
kin's Jug Band, with her husband
Geoff, and Paul Butteriield she has
more than enough credentials and
experience to justify a solo album.

“Don’t you feel my leg (Don't you
make me High)” is the best cut
on the album. Doctor John's piano
work and horn arrangements along

. with Muldaur's vocals make the most

both out of the lyrics and music.
Richard Green’s fiddle work on
“Walkin’ One and Only" make a
nice cover of this Dan Hicks tune.
0n “Long Hard Climb” Muldaur
shows that she can sing ballads as
well as any other pop tune. All
the tunes on this album are strong
and combined with theI excellent
backing make this one of the best
albums of 1973.

By now, most oius have heard an»

thers and Sisterss, and it is quite
apparent that the Allman’s have

Still held strong despite the fact
that one third of the original hand
is dead: and that they are quite

popular. The only effect popularity
has had on them, besides monetary
benefits, is that it has encouraged
them to write more original tunes.
Both Ailman Brother's Band and
ldlewild South along with the Hour
Glass album had too few original
compositions. “Ramblin' Man,”
”Southbound,” “Jessica" and
”Pony Boy" are the best cuts on

the album, and all originals
Stevie Wonder has been around ior
more than to years and has remains

ed consistently good. lnnervisions

might be the best single oi the
year. ”Too High" and "Visions’l
are also excellent. The album is
definitely already one of the top
ten best (if there exists such a list)
or the year and Motown must be
commended for iinally taking
a chance.

There are a few other albums
from the Hot box which I’d like to
recommend, Eddie Harris, Realizar

to Talking Book but rather as a

cuts are excellent, and Stevie has

With the commercial success (re»

A Radical Solution

ing change irom the rather dismal

status quo.

It was then that this writer hit
upon the ideal solution. The prob
lem with national politics is that
it all happens in Washington. The
city itself is the problem. After all,
all the Watergate involvees heralded
tram the city at the time of their
conviction, unrn‘asking, or whatever.
Almost all Congressmen, Senators
or aides convicted of illegal activ-
ities worked in Washington. Even
more facts substantiate this posi-
tion.

It was George Washington, or some
other founding father who observed
that the site for the capital was a
"dismal swamp.” This writer al-
ways thought throughout American
history class that the major reason
for building our capital in the middr
Ie of the Potomac was so that it
was convenient for Mr. Jefferson,
sort of a kickback for all the work
he did on the Declaration of Inde»
pendence. And have you ever noti»
ced how just about every president
has done his best to escape the
capital. This man thinks the Sec-
ret Service people could have got-
ten Nixon off on the home improve-
ment rap by simply noting the SS
was trying to protect the president
by getting him out oi the city.

The architecture of the city lends
itself the proliferation of dase
tardly deeds, The rather preten—
tious buildings housing our govern—
ment look like something Out of a
set for 2 Louis XIV movie. How
can we expect our Presidents to
act like anything but kings being
billeted at the White House? Can
one imagine a President living in a

Finally, it the capital was some—

to understand the language spoken
there. As it is now, that is vir-
tually impossible,

ent, Washington seems to poison
politics around the entire nation,
to some degree. Mass. and Mary-
land have the dirtiest politics in the
nation, except for Texas, and mi
Just think, though, all 0! those pl-
aces are connected by Water to Wa-

Of course, this writer does have
a solution. The capital of the United
States should_be in no midwest,
say in Denver, Omaha, K.C., Des
Moines. or St, Paul. Can one ima~
gine a Politician in Omaha being
pretentious. Of course, much of the
government could he leit in Washing-
ton to sink back into the swamp.
HEW, the Defense Department, and
the Post Office just wouldn't fit in
Omaha. But why not leave the Pre-
sident, too, and while we’re at it,
what about the congress...the mind
boggles.
