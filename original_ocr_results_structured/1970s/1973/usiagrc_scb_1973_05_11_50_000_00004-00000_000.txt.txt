Goals And Tactics

In our editorial supporting Scott Weil for SGA President
we commented that “with effective, responsive leadership
(SGA) may be shocked out of its doldi‘ums”. To limit the shock
to SGA was arbitrary in light of the action taken at the Dean’s
Open Forum.

The proposals are significant and supportable though they
may not be as comprehensive as they appear on first glance.
Co-determination of academic policy by the teacher and the
student may in theory result in the best policies because it
involves the parties most directly affected. Experiences this
year have shown that faculty and students have had some
fundamental differences over academic issues.

The establishment of a committee whose sole function is to
examine educational alternatives and innovative modes is sig
nificant in that it would reaffirm Grinnell’s stated commitment
to progressive education. The concept of community government
may provide the alternative governance model that Grinnell has
been seeking.

The tactical tool used to force the issue contains many
implications. One principle of conflict politics is to make the
other party suffer at its own expense. If the proposed letter
is sent and diverts possible Grinnellians elsewhere, the tool
becomes a double-edged sword. If in trying toimprove Grinnell
structurally it is harmed substantively, no one gains.

Much is at stake in the resolution of this issue and will be
crucial in determining how effective SGA will be this coming
year. Much has been committed on behalf of the students by
individuals who concurrently occupy positions in the student
government. We must play the role of interested observer
for the move has been made for us. s-BLS

An Ending

Well, here it is, nine months later. And with this final regular
issue put to bed, the Scarlet and Black prepares to close out
the season.

Where do we begin? Countless people have been of immease
urable assistance during the course of the year. The first, and
foremost words of praise, of course, must go to the, many‘
reporters and photographers who were responsible, by and
large, for the week-by-week success of the 1972773 Scarlet
and Black. Their names appeared with their work and every
week you could see them in small type in the masthead, but
nowhere have these people received the thanks they deserve.

Those unfamiliar with the operation of newspapers generally
do not realize the kind of work which goes into an article. Even
minor stories may take hours and hours of research, writing,
and rewriting. Eventually we all suffer headaches from dead-
line pressure, and on top of that the editor may slash and tear
apart a reporter’s verbs and adjectives so as to make them
unrecognizable in final form.

The photographer is no less burdened. Sometimes one must
sit through an entire lecture or performance just to geta
good shot of it, and then to develop, fix, wash and dry the film
and prints eats up hours of valuable time a week.

Our notes of appreciation, however, cannot end with these.
Mr. William Deminoff, Mr. Roger McMullin, and other em-
ployees of the Office of College Relations were invaluable
throughout the year for helping us keep track of numerous
campus events and lending a picture when we were caught in
a bind. Mrs. Pauline Pugh was cookand chauffeur par excellence
and provided strong moral support throughout the year, and
special thanks must go to Mr. Dale Hawn and members of the
Buildings and Grounds crew who permitted us to borrow B&G
trucks for transportation to the printers twice a week.
Without their generous assistance, we quiteliterally would have
been unable to get anywhere.

Marty lker and Dave Calvert provided us, we believe, with
a fine quality of sports editing during the course of the year,
relieving the editors for concentration on the news and feature
'aspects of the paper. Nancy Oswald as typist saved us from
miserable hours picking away at the keys, and why anybody
would take the job in the first place will forever remain a
mystery. And artist Miriam Burstein’s ability to produce
tine drawings with little advance notice was a continual source
of, amazement. Mr. and Mrs. Morrissey and Marilyn, our
typesetter, at the Montezuma Republican were as always
pleasant to work with, and the people at Sutherland Printing
Company offered us valuable technical assistance and advice
several times during the year.

And last, but not least, all would be amiss if we did not thank
our readers, the students of Grinnell. By offering criticism
and suggestions, writing letters to the paper, and by showing
in countless other ways that you cared, you gave us the cone
fidence, week by week, that what we were doing was worth
while. You helped us to keep going, and in an operation where
any other remuneration is virtually nonsignificant, that was a
great help indeed.

Women: Discrimination

(Editor’s note: The following let»
ter, written to College President
Glenn Leggett, is reprinted here
at the request of its authors.)

Dear President Leggett

We would like to bring to your
attention the following areas of sex
discrimination on this campus.
CURRICULUM: Materialprescntcn
on women in all disciplines is re~
garded as a special topic. not as
an integral part of course content
Many departments simply ignore
thelconlribullons of women In their
fields

PERSONNEL: Faculty andadmlnr
istrators are role-models for stur
dents. Presently those fullillingthat
capacity are almost exclusively wh—
ite miles. All Students would bene-
fit from contact with a WIde vars
iety of competent professional woe
men.

FACILITIES’ Large numbers 0f\\'os

men are regularly using the phyr
sicdl education complex The cur-
rent ldcilities are already inade»
quate, especially the number oflou
kers and mount of ﬂoor space.
CAREER SERVICES: The present
program does not meet the needs
of women graduates in finding and
entering careers commiserate to
their cducationzil background.
HEALTH CARE Incomplete pro-
vision has been made for women’s
health needs Without personal me-
ans of transportation, there is no
access to a gynecologist, ,
These inequities are of great con-
cern to us and we assume you will
find them equally disturbing. As well
as being detrimental to our educar
tIon and wellbeing, many oftheprer
sent practices violate HEW guide-
lines.

Grinnell’s Women's Movement

Dawson: Event Funds

To the Editors:

As outgoing chairman of the Pub-
lic Events Committee I would like
to express some thoughts to the
College community on this year’s
experimental cultural events Ser»
ies,

For the first time ina number of
years we have had a proper cultural
events series (N, Y Pro Musica;
Bashknr Indian Dance; the Oxford-
Cambridge Shakespeare Co , Oscni-
Ghiglia, guitar; the Polish Mime
Ballet Theatre; Betty Allen, 50p-
rano) made possible by combined
financIng from SGA, the Music DEV
partment, and the Administration,
o‘nd managed by an enlarged face
ulty-Student Public Events Commie
ttee.

In my View the series was a diSr
Iinct success‘ the events were of
Substantial quality and the demand
for tickets was Strong, And, apart
from the N Y. Pro MusIcﬂ where
we Substantially underestimated the
demand, practically everyone we
could attract has been able toattend,
Over the course of the year serious
procedural difficulties, e. g, fairs
ness in ticket distribution, were grr
'adually‘ Ianed Udli‘kl‘he Committee
hoped the series could be repeated
and perhaps even expanded for next
year.

This year the Music Department
and the Administration agreed to
renew their budget allocations, but
this year’s SGA chose to Cut by one
third Its budget allocation, despite
the budget ease provided bytheTrur
stee Increase in Student fees The

reason given by son was a desire
to shift lunds to popular concerts,
especially the large rock events.
(Part of the original purpose of the
experiment had been to provide
better‘balance in the over—all pro—
gram; in recent years some $35,
000 has gone into popular events
and about a tenth of thIS amount
into cultural events).

But in my view the matter had
really become a student power
political football, The Cultural se-
ries was associated with faculty
initiative, student power could be
shown; the Public Events Commie
ttee was therefore punished. As a
result of the SGA action, the Col—
lege community will have a lesser
SerIes available next year.

i conclude from this experiment
that these arrangements for fin—
ancing cultural events at Grinnell
are probably not satisfactoryforthe
longer run, We cannot expect SGA
regularly to support serious events
when the matter is put to the vote
as a contest with popular entertain-
ment. And we cannot expect SGA
regularly to support the public ins
terest if it is adverse to student
power concerns. In these matters
I hope I am mistaken. But in any
event is is high time for the buds
getlng of student iee dollars to be
placed under the policy review and
final approval of the administration
and trustees, like the rest of the
College's budget.

Supports Iowa Bun: Cans,

by Fran Cutler

ThrOWraway and Soft drInk contains
ers are tremendously wastefuland
unecologlt‘al. In 1969 Americans
bought 15 billion cans and throne
away bottles of Soft drinks and more
than 21 billion more than the same
beverages would have cost in return-
able bottles. Taxpayers contributed
at least another $350 million to dlSr
pose of those containers and clean
up beverage container llItcr, More
over, this does not even Include the
costs of air pollution from manu-
locturing onerway containers, ortlie
cost or personal iniuries and prop
erty damage from carelessly dISr
carded bottles, cans, and pull-tabs,

in response to this problem, Ore»
gon enacted a tough beverage con-
tainer law which went into cficct in

October of 1972 The major pl‘ovls- '

ions of this bill are the banning of
snap-top cans, and throw-away bol-
ties and the requirement of 5C re-
Iunds to be paid on n11 beer, malt
and carbonated beverage containers
except for short necked lZ-ounce
beer bottles on which 2;. must be
paid No deposn is required, but
it is assumed that the deposit will
be added to the cost of the pros
duct at the time of sale, II 2| dealer
sells the brand and slze of contains
er offered for refund, then she/lie
must pay the required refund to any
consumer upon presentation of tile
container,

Most dealers complained that, whr
Ile they did not mind getting back
bottles, they definitely (lid not want
to have to handle empty cans. As a
result, provision was mude loi- es-
tabllshlng redemption centers. Th-

ese centers mustprovide a “conven-
ient service to consumers for the
return of empty beverage contain-
ers" to specific dealers. Each dea-
ler who is served by a redemption
center may refuse to provide a re,
fund and may instead direct his cus»
tomers to Obtain their refunds at
the redemption center, It is EXr
peeled that this option will be ex-
ercised mainly for cans and only in
metropolitan areas. Additional pro-
visions of the bIll provide for mark-
ings on the containerto clearlyshow
the value of the refund.

By every criteria-eexcept that of
beverage can manufacturers-4M5
measure appears to be highly sucv
cessful. The results, compiled by
the Oregon Environmental Council,
show that no adverse effects on the
the sales fOI' beer have occurred.
Costs have Increased slightly for
distributors and grocers since they
must now handle a larger volume
of returned containers However,
surveys of lItteI" taken before Oct-
ober 1972 and after December 1972
show beverage bottle and can litter
down approximately 50 percent to

To the Editors:

in reading the 5&8 during the past
year i have come to enjoy and look
forward to Jim Ali's columns. What
they lacked in numbers they cer-
tainly made up in quality. A few
of them could be classified as minor
masterpieces. With a little humor
he usually managed to reduce overly
serious concerns to their proper
perspective, His alternative view
will be missed.

I Cantaloupe:
Revolution

To the Editors,

You people seem to know most
of what is going on around here.
The szB has long had a reputa-
tion for having its ears to the Grin-
nell navel, so to speak.

Could you please tell us when
the revolution is? I want to set my
alarm clock so i will get up in
time for the big kick-off party.

To the Editors:

At this time I would like to thank
the cast of thousands who have
made it all possible and throw my
wholehearted support to Mr. Bill
Davis in his bid to be elected to
the Board of Trustees of Grinnell
College.

And yes, i would even walk over
my own genitals to get him elected.
I think he could do wonders with
the Sanitation department as well.

’70 percent.

Because there has been a major
change from one-use to reusable
containers. very few soft drink or
beer cans are now being sold in
Oregon, As a result, one son drink
canning company has gone out of
business. The remaining son drink
canning company» has experienced
a marked reduction in sales butcon-
tinues to market in OregonandWas-
hington. ii is encouraging to note
however, that energy and nonreneWr
able resources are being conserved

At present, there is a beverage
container bill before the Iowa Ste
ate Legislature, However, it has
been hidden away somewhere in
committee,

1 would strongly urge all Grin»
nellians to write either State Sen-
ator Joan Orr or State Represen-
talive Emil Husak expressing their
interest and support for the passage
of this bill, It Is Important that
support be demonstrated so that
the lobbying efforts at the soft
drink canning industry can be coun-
teracted.
