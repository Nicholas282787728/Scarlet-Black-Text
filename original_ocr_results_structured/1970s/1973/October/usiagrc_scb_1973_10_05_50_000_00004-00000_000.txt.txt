1 Action Without
Thought...

Grinnell’s Student Government Association has taken another
strong action where, perhaps, a seemingly milder action would
have done more good, - .

Wednesday night, a boycott was called against the Longhorn
Restaurant after the Joint Boards heard charges that the estab-
lishment was discriminating against the Black students in the
Grinnell Community.

Under no circumstances can discrimination against any ethnic
group be tolerated in this community. However, the situation
between CBS and Longhorn owner-manager Tom Parmley may

contain more elements of misunderstanding than actual discrim—
ination. This can best be determined by a thorough investigation.

Many students have complained that service to students in general
‘at the Longhorn is poor. SGA Vice President John Potts expressed
the view that “the Longhorn doesn’t care about you so long as you
pay your bill." The problem may not be racial, but instead may be
part of the broader issue of townscollege relations.

We are sorry that the Joint Boards moved so rapidly to institute
a community wide boycott without first exploring the other alterna-
tives or allowing Parmiey to makeapresentatlon on his own behalf.

Perhaps the most viable alternative lies with the Grinnell Human
Rights Commission -- a little known but vital organization in the
Grinnell community set up to handle Just such‘problems,

Few members of the campusicommunity know there is a Human
Rights Commission. Fewer still realize its scope and powers,
The Commission is chartered under both city ordinance and the
Code of Iowa to “receive, investigate, and pass upon complaints
alleging untairor discriminatory practices.” It can act informally,
to reconcile the aggrieved parties, or formally, to force Complls

.ance with the law,

If ever a case should have been_handled first by the commission,
it is this one. However, apparently no one within CBS was aware of
the organization’s procedures. It is not anyone’s fault 7- rather,
it is an unfortunate accident. '

However, before Wednesday’s meeting, steps had been taken to
inform officials of both CBS and SGA of the Commission’s willinge
ness to intervene ifasked. Afew hours before the meeting, President
Well and leaders of CBS had reached an informal agreement that
the CBS complaints would be presented to the Joint Boards as a
point of information, but that the Commission would be allowed to
act before CBS requested any action on the part of SGA.

CBS acted as it had said it would. Sybille Scott, their authorized
spokesperson in this matter, presented the matter to the Joint
Boards, and included'a statement outlining the CBS boycott. She
did not ask for endorsement of an allacommunity boycott.

However, Board members seized the initiative and madethe move
on their own. This also influenced CBS, whose members decided
after a brief caucus that, if SGA‘ wanteda broad boycott, they would
not object.

One member of the cabinet described a Joint Boards meeting
as a process of thinking out loud, In this instance, we feel the
members did not think hard enough. Many broad repercussions
from such an action could have been avoided by a thorough con—
sideration of the options available.

First, the matter should have gone through the Human Rights
Commission -- a process that would have taken only a matter
of days. Then, if a satisfactory solution were not reached, further
action could have been considered.

Second, House Presidents should have been allowed a chance to
consult with their constituencies. This would have allowed them
to gather ideas for action as well as disseminate information
to the campus. '

‘ We hope that, by the time this is printed, the problem will have
been settled. But more important, wehope that all levels of campus
government will take a close look at the mistakes made here

The issue involves two differing cases of discrimination ~ one
against an ethnic group, the other in thought and action. We feel
that discrimination against an ethnic group is not to be tolerated
and that CBS has acted justly. By the same token, we should be

iintolerant of indiscriminate actions by the Joint Boards beyond
those required by the situation. i

Friedman Blasts Kurz, Supports Marine Rights

To the Editors

I am horrified by the flagrant
disregard for civil liberties exprr
essed by Leonard Kilrz in his letter
of September 28, While he certainly
has the right to his opinion, and
should by all means he encouraged
to express his views, it Seems to
me that his argument misses the
point, -
I agree with Mr. Kurz that civil
liberties is not an issue when the
law forbids rape and murder, how-
ever he mistakenly equates recrr
uitment into the Marine Corps to
such criminal activities. The Victim
of rape and murder is lust that ..
a victim, But Grinnell students do

Dunn Reacts to Knapp

'l'o the Editors

1 find the attitude of Mr, Knapp’s
recent column regarding the lettuce
referendum offensive to my sense
of logic, il nothing else

I am very sorry if any supporters
of the boycott have stooped to put-
ting nasty notes in his mailbox
or bothering him at odd times of
the morning, but all moral issues
aside the fact remains that the stun
dent population voted overwhelms
ingly in favor of SAGA’s boycotting
non-Farmworker’s Union lettuce
To use an analogy mentioned in
the column, if two-thirds of the
campus (a smaller mayoriry than
that by which the boycott vote was
passed) had voted last fall to give
the entire special events fund to
the Nixon campaign 1 would not
have been pleased and I might have
looked for another school to go to,
but i would have accepted the fact
that I was overruled {or better or
worse, as many of us were obliged
to do when Nixon was finally elect-
ed. 01 course, we don't have to
agree with him or support his po~
liiicnl views, and as far as all
that is concerned it IS a lot easier
to trot down to McNally's and gorge
on head lettuce than n is to emmi-
grate. So much for analogies

But really! No one on this campus
IS lorcing anyone else not to eat
lettuce The issue Was confined to
the lood service and ii any person’
who feels deprived of their right
to eat lettuce is too uncreative or
lazy to think of going to the store
and getting some, l just can't be-
come overly concerned on behalf
of Grinnell's newest minoritygroup..

have a choice about whether they
will be convinced by, talkto, or even
look at the Marine Corps' represen-
tative. Furthermore, even ir Mr.
Kurz believes the army to be im-
moral and unnecessary, that IS his
opinion and n is nbviously notshared
by everyone. We all have the right
of access to information about the
military and the right to choose to
be recruited: to deny that to in-
terested Grihnell Students )5 indeed
an infringement of their civil liber-
ties.

Certainly the presence of one llt-
erature table and the availability
or a personal interview by appoint-
ment is not contrarvtotheacademic

spirit; certainlythose recruiters did
not force themselves on unwilling
Students.
It is even in the interests of the
moral opponents or the army that
servicemen come from as wide a
range of backgrounds as possible:
if there IS to be an army it should
be of the people. This can be acc-
ompllshed only by vigorous recruit-
ment.

Deborah Friedman
P.S, I noticed that the piles of lit»
erature on the Marine Corps’ table
disappeared rather qulckly. Perhaps
there is more interest in theArmed
Forces than Mr. Kurz would
suppose.

loddengaard Opposes Protanity Handout

To the Editors:

This letter is in response to the
epistle distributed to the campus
community earlier this week re-
gardlng the alleged “unbridled self-
indulgence” in “vulgar language.”
The' communication, regardless of
who is responsible for It, IS ab-
surd and prodigiously unperceptive.
The author ls oblivious to several
essential psychollinguistic facts,
which I will proceed to enumerate.

First of all, he rejects the validity
of four letter words as a Viable
mode of self expressson, This is
an inordinately ethnocentrlc position
to take, especially in such an open
community as Grinnell, These words
also provide a vital non—destructive
outlet for frustration, Linger, and

other intense and stressful elitot-
ional states. Such an outlet is par-
ticularly important at a place where
sociOsacademic tensions are high.
Finally, the use of ”Vulgar" lane
guage does not negate the possibilr
ity of an extensive vocabulary.

It should be abundantly clear that
one does not always find it impere
ative to make full use of one’s Von
cabulary i am confident that the vast
majority of the Grinnell student body
possess the ability to discern when
and where to use the appropriate
language. In conclusion, I have only
one more thing to say to the anony-
mous author of Monday’s letter:
fuck Off!

‘ Thomas Loddehgaard

Frost Rips atWyIv 's Marine Stance

To the Editors

I must heartily protest iheposninn
taken by Mr, Wyly in his most re-
cent editorial. Often i am attacked
as an idealist with stars in my eyes
blinding me to the real world. Mr.
Wyly is equally guilty or such an
oilense: he seems to see some rort
or sweet freedom of choice demo-
cracy as uiopian,

My friend, democracy doesn’t clr
aim to be the best for all, only for
the majority. So scrcwthe minority,
Laws are in power and rights are
only guaranteed as long as they
have majority support. ii at any
tune that mayoriiy decides a min-
ority shouldn't be allowed to be
recruited by a murderous organizer
tion or that mayoriry (in reference
to Mr Knapp) decides that a minor
ity can’t rapaclously oppress farmr
workers, so be it This Is the nature
of democracy: there are no natural
rights, and any such conceptso con-
strued is merely the product or
majority will.

Mr Wyly seems to want to have
his cake and eat ii too. Either
you affirm democracy and accept
being shat upon occasmnnlly, oryou
become as a dictator or dictated
.nnd Simply have which rights ror
which people spelled out in the prir
sons.

Retreat from your poSltinn of in—
fantile lenism, Mr. Wyly .. it is
inherently contradictory. Freedom
of choice and democracy, in the way
they seem to be stretched are mu-
tually incompatible. in a class soc-
iety such as ours, one's fredom is
inevitably at another's expense.

No, not by any means IS simple
democracy an answer to an ordered
society. The society must first be
made more equitable, more ClBSSA
less to enable true democracy to
function. 50 these inequalities are
subsumed, the class basis for mine
only/majority opinion’ is lost and
the danger of majority tyranny is
no longer present
Also note, Mr. Wyly, that as taxi
payers who paid for that Marine
garbage, people have an equal right
to rent it or read it.

R. L. Frost

Ed. nnte-rOur records show that
Associate Professor of Music .Ia-
mes Wyly has never written for this
newspaper in any capacity. We thus
fail to see the relevance of Mr,
Frost’s letter.
