For thirty minutes last Saturday
it looked like the Grinnell Pioneers
were going to treat the visiting ale
umni to their first win ofthe season.

is at 1:30 on Ward Field.

Craig Kouba kicked one field goal
in each or the first two quarters ior
Cornell. This was the only first
,half scoring. Dave Wopat started in

back [or Grinnell. Delaney came in
three times to throw passes from
the shotgun position, five yards be»
hind the center on the snap. Grin-
hell had trouble offensively gaining
just 70 yards on the ground and 10
in the air. “Weplayed ourbestgame

ated Grinnell coach Edd Bowers.

Women Can’t Score;

Grinnell’s field hockey team lost
its third encounter of the 1973

Saturday. it was the lust home
game oi the season, although sev-
eral games remain to be played
on the road,

in the rainy first hall the firedv
up pioneers very nearly took commv

good scoring opportunities tailed,

fore the women would take the lead.

iles' head. Both squads had score
ing opportunities in the third quarr
ter but neither could convert. Terr
ry Skilling scored for Cornell on a
tit yard run in the iourth quarter
and quarterback Tom Albert threw
twice to Jim Hoffman for finish the
scoring.

Bowers did note someimprovement
in the Pioneer offense, “We were
more aggressive bit the line"oi
scrimmage and on occasion came
up with good blocking. We have to
gain some confidence inour oiiense,
and the best way to do that is to
score some points.” Lawrence
ranks just above Grinnell in the
bottom of conference statistics. Bo-
wers was pleased with the per—
iormance or freshman Hosea Eng-
ram, who, though he never played
high school football, led the ground
attack with 42 yards in 16 carries.

Thus far this season Grinnell has
been outscored in conierence play
119-0 while Lawrence has beenbea—
ten by a total of 93724. Both squads
have received losses at the hands
of Monmouth and Coe the two cons
iel'ence powerhouses.

One Grinnell torward, Mary Jane
Elam, commented aiterwards, “In
the nrst halt we played better than
we’d played in three years " Des-
pite controlling the action through
most or the 35~minute first halt,
at halftime the Pioneersfoundthem»
selves in a scoreless contest.

The second hall was iull of mis-
cues and general poor play for both
teams. The pioneers, according to
one team member, seemedto”come
down to the level of” the lowateam.
She added, “We just couldn’t seem
to click in the second half.”

MOUNT VERNON, IAerespite a
strong individual effort by co-cap-
tain Peter Horowitz; the Gri‘nell
soccer team dropped its third game

witz’s two tallies were nulli ed by
a late Ram goal. The defeat brought
the Pioneers’s wonslost record to
a dismal 1-3, while Cornell coll-
ected its fourth win against no
losses.

At first it looked as if the Pio-
neers were going to run away with
the contest. An early penalty cal—
led against a Ram iullback gave
l-lor'owitz a penalty shot and Grinr
hall a l»0 lead after two minutes
of play. Grinnell con ihued to mount
a strong attack, bu the next score
was tallied by Cornell, The cone
troversial goal was awarded to the
Rams when a Cornell shot—on-goal
slipped through the grasp of goalie
John Haigh and popped up into the
air, Although Haigh caught the ball
in the air. the referee ruled that it
had cleared the goal line. No Core

nell player got credit for the goal,
officially it was an “own goal,‘

or one not produced by an often-
sive player

The Pioneers came roaring back
late in the half and scored onuHor—
owitz breakaway. Taking a_ leading
pass iroin Pete Shearer, Grinnell’s
leading scorer placed the ball to
the right of Ram goalie Mike Stern
and just inside the left upright for
a 2-1 halt-lime advantage,

Both squads played sloppily at the
outset of the second stanza. Mis-
takes predominated through much
at the half. The Rams snapped out
of it before Grinnell and tied the
game on a goal by Bill Cady. ht
this point the pace became iurious,
with both clubs desparate for the
tie-breaker. Cornell maintained
control, however, duringmuchoithe

Grinnell squad. Perhaps it is the

Grinnell has played hali its 1973
games and now begins the second
round, the round of rematclles. Ale
though the Pioneers lost three oi
their first four contests, each 1055
was by one goal. while there is no
telling what might happen in the next
four games, it is extremely unlike-
ly that they will leave the Pioneers
on top of the Midwest Conference
Southern Division, as was onceconr
Sidered possible. Grihhell will be
hard-pressed to match last year's
second place finish In fact, at this
point a .500 record is a diiiicult
proposition.

Philosophy SenSIble, But Hus Flaw:

by Dave Schechter

Grinhell’s basic philosophy ot ath-
letics is an excellent one that has
many workable qualities. There are
however several items in athletics
at Grinnell that could undergo imr
pruvement. The trustees and adminv
istrators believe that athletics are
an integral part of the educationpro-
cess, but that at no time shouldthey
become prereminent over academic
studies. This is the basis of Grinr
hell’s attitude towards athletics, and
l for one, would like to see it
adopted by more institutions oihigh-
er learning

Jim Avison of theoffice oi‘develope
ment says, "’l‘hetrusteesare indeed
saying, we want a program oiinter-
collegiate athletics. It’s one part
oi the diversity oi the college."
This diversity should also extend
to women's athletics. when View
From the Sidelines returns after

investigation into women's athlete
ics at Grinnell.

The William Penn runners sure
prised everybody by starting very
quickly, but by the one and a half

mile mark Dave Raub had taken the
lead pulling away from the field,
He went on to decimate Cornell's
George Delpertdahg by 30 seconds
to a big ovation from the partial
home fans.

William Penn’s Bob Parrott came
in third. Clusin and Blanchard fin—
ished third and fourth.

Russ Damtoft (allowed his good
run last week with an eighth place
finish this week. Tom Howlnnd was

ly but surely making his way to a
