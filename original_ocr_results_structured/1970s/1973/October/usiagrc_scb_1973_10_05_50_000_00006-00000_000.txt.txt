Grinnell Goes to England

by Laura Miller

Applications tor the Grinnellrin-
London semester, a program to be
oriered under College auspices iorr
the first time in the fall of 1974,
will be accepted beginning October
15. Juniors and sophomores with
an overall GPA of 2 5 are eligible,
Freshman applicants will be tenta~
tively considered.

The curriculum [or the semester
abroad combines anthropology,
comparative literature, and history
in a flexible program emphasmng
undergraduate research. During
Phase I, students will take two to
three courses in the immediate
London area taught by both Grinnell
iaculty and residents or London.

Possible selections for Phase II,
a more intensive project locusing
on one major area, include field
studies in a rural Village anywhere
in Great Britain, an investigation
in Paris or modern France and
the historical past of its capital,
or a survey oi English thought
and culture in the Middle Ages
offered in London,

Douglas Caulkins, a Gi'innell anths
ropology instructor who is partir
cipating in the London semester,
said of theI program, “It is valu-
able as background for tiny number
of vocations.”

The London Site for Phase l is
in BayswatersQueensway, a heter-
ogeneous area ol stable population,
containing wide range of socioseco-
nomic classes. Students will reside
in a number or inexpensive student
hotels, and classes will be held
in thevicarage oianAnglican Church
nearby. No other American colony
exists in the immediate area, Good
transportation can be found to the
theatre district and other places
of interest.

Participation in the Grinnellsins
London semester requires some
advance planning. Most oi the

courses carry prerequisites whn
must be Satlslied at the College‘.
"We are trying to tie the program
into the existing curriculum,” ex-
plained victor Verrette, program
director and prolessor or French.

Because all or the Students invs
clved will he enrolled at Grinnell,
unlike CMA projects where only a
handful are lrom the College, Caul—
klns believes it is likely that there
will be “a real impact on t '-
campus from returning Students
They will be asked to Share their
experiences through slides and lecs
tures in courses marked as pres
requisite for the lollowing year’s
program.

According to Verrette, ”The most
important part oi the application is
the student’s statement or interest
in the program.” A letter of rev
commendation and possibly per
sonal screening also will be requir:

writing letters, We believe that
letters lrom the college as a whole
should be approved by the SGA
beiore they are sent out to parents,
trustees, students, and the SGA.
The administration continues to
evade our demands. The demands
originated as requests, but whenthe
administration reinsed to cooperateg
we changed them to demands. Th
administration demonstrated its
contempt tor our demands by ans-
wering them with letters which SGA
did not approve. We Cannot tolerate
such a Slap in our collective lace.
Therefore, we will confiscate all
letters from the administration be-
fore they reach your mailboxes.
If any letters written without SGA
approval are read, our tactic is
subverted. We enlist your cooper—
ation in this matter. .
