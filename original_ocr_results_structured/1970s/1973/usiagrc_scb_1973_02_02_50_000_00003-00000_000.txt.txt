I Adopted Siblings:
Double Blessing

by Ken Winokur

The primary goal tor the Big Brottler~Blg Sister program in Grlnnell
is “to provide the companionship oi older people to kids whose parents
are unable to do so". AS big brothers and big sisters, students from
Grinnell College have been trying to give this type of assistance to chil-
dren from the local grade schools. Teachers in the grade schools pick
children whom they think are in need oi adult companionship.

Volunteer students [mm the college arrange activities {or themselves
and their little brothers and sisters. Approximately 55 couples are cure
rently involved in the program. Each couple is encouraged to meet ire-
ouently, usually once a week.

The Big Brother program was begun two years ago by VISTA and has
since been taken over by students at the college. Three of these stu-
dents, Wes Fujii, DaVid Ogden, and Beth Russell have periormed the
primary duties or organizing and running it.

Wes explained that the program was originally organized to beneiit the
Children, but the college students received benefits also. ”The Grinnell
campus is very much closed. Most or the people are the same age with
the same beliefs and attitudes. It’s a homogeneous atmosphere. The pro-
gram encourages them to do diiierent things, as well as to help out other
human beings,”

From the perspective of the kids and from that of the college students
the program appears to be a remarkable success. At the present time
there is a list of about twenty children waiting (01' big brothers or sisters
ruiii noted that having a big brother orsister is a “status symbol” among
the grade school society. The olderhalfol'the couples, the college students,
appear to appreciate the program also with a large percentage signing
up {or a second or even a third year.

Although the program can be deemed a success, it is not without problems.
Finding enough college students to match withthelarge numbers or anxious
children has been impossible. Later in the year, approximately thirty
Students from the local high school will assume the job at big brothers
and sisters to help ﬁll the demand.

Another problem has been for the individuals to find activities compatible
to both older and younger brothers and sisters.Next semester, in cooperAr
tion with the high schools and grade schODlS. a newsletter will be distributed
telling oi community and college activities.

it appears that the Big Brother-Big Sister program has done more than
simply It’s aim to “provide companionship.” it has also prompted interest
and possibly broadened the horizons of Grinnell college students and young
townspeople.
