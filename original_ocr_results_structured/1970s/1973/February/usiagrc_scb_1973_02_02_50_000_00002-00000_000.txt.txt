Intricate Admissions
Operation Evolves

by Bonnie Roswig

To the high school senior wish‘
ing to enter college, the admis-
sions office is either his great»
est friend or his greatest enemy.
However, how many students, eit-
her applying or enrolled, really
understand the workings of the chr
lege admissions office?

At Grinnell, the admissions of-
fice is headed by D. Nicholas Ryan.
Dean Ryan explained that he holds
a unique position at Grinnell in that
he is not only Dean of Admissions
but also Dean of Student Financial
Aid. Ryan commented that both pos—
itions are very time consuming and
that he handles the work load by
alloting, “Certain blocks of time
to each.”

Ryan explained that admissions
procedures are handled by his office
in a variety ol ways. ”A major
function of the staff is an extene
sive high school visitation program
involving hundreds ofschools around
the country. Our counselors talk
with students and high school coun-
selors in ore-arranged appoint—
merits."

Ryan explained that admissiolls
procedures are handled by his office
in a variety of ways, “One way we
work admissions is to have our Ad-
missions Counselors make pre-ar-
ranged appointments at different
high schools around the country. At
that time our counselors talk with
students and high school guidance
counselors.”

Dean Ryan is assisted by full
time Admissions Counselors Mario
Bognanno, Stephen Carroll, Maurice
l-lunt, Roger Koester and part time
counselor Marilyn Scholl. Bognanno,
Carroll and Koester are all Grinr
nell graduates who travel to difr
terent parts of the country conducts
ing interviews. Dean Ryan explained
that Mr. Hunt is, "coordinator ofthe
Black Admissions program, while
Ms. School covers the Chicago area
exclusively."

High schools, in the pastiew years,
have been bombarded with many rec
quests for interview appointments
by colleges. Ryan noted that his
otlice is trying another proced-
ure, “We are now attempting to
contact students other than through
the high school class day. For exe
ample, to New York we will send
three representatives who will call
upon all students who have pre
viously contacted us tor admissions
information. Each student Will then

Chief Peters has informed the
College that beginning next week
he will have his Officei‘sticket-
ing cars parked on the wrong
side of the street on Park and
East Streets.

New signs will be put up(Mon-
day, Wednesday, Friday, Sun—
day, etc) indicating which days
you can park on which side ol
the street. During days when
snow removal is required, cars
parked on the wrong side of the
street may be towed away

have the opportunity to visit with a
representative in a hotel situation.
We’ll be doing the same thing in
Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San
Francisco and Washington DC,”

Another way in which the Admise
sions office reaches perspective
students is through a film. Thefilm,
which comes in ten andtwenty—eight
minute versions, explains about life
on the Grinnell campus, and is nar-
rated by NBC newsman Peter Hac-
hes. a Grinnell graduate. The pur-
pose of the film, said Ryan, “is
to give the college a chance to be
presented to a lot more students
than the staff could hope to see."

Increased Alumni involvement in
dealing with prospective students is
another aim of the admissions ole
fice. “One of the great values ofthe
alumni is that they are able to re-
ach students in areas we are unable
to visit." presently, admissions
committees are being organized in
alumni clubs in assorted metropol»
itan areas. Admissions counselor
Mario Bognanno, a 1972 Grinnell
graduate, is coordinating the ef-
fort,

Within the last few years small
private colleges have suffered from
spiraling tuitions and a decrease in
student applications. Dean Ryan
commented that Grinnell has
been affected by this trend, along
with all the ACM schools. ”Last
year our applications increased,
however this year they are about
back to normal " Ryan reported that
the ACM schools are collectively
down 18% this year, while Grinnell
is down 11%. Besides the increase
in tuition, Ryan attributed thistrend
to what he refers to as, “Stopping
out. Many seniors are deciding not
to go directly into college after high
school graduation. They are looking
for an alternative experience. “ Dean
Ryan also suggested that with the
end of the draft, males aren’t look-
ing to college as a deferment. He
also cited the changing trends in
population growth as another rea-
son for the decrease in college
applicants. “At this point the
post World War II "baby boom”
has passed through college. And, the
aim toward zero population growth
is another aspect.”

In respect to the rising tuition
costs in small private colleges Ryan
expressed the fear that polariza-
tion might grow up. “Financial aid
programs on the federal level have
been targeted at students from low
income families. There is no relief
for the middle income family with
the rising costs of college educa-
tions. High costprivate colleges may
soon be mainly populated with stu-
dents from very high or very low
income families and polarization
could occur ”

its for the future ol the admissions
policy at Grinnell, Ryan commented,

~”We’d like to continue stressing

direct dialogue with prospective stu-
dents as a means of accuratelypre—
senting the college to as manywelle
qualified candidates as possible."

Works To Make Financial

by John Wylie

Maintaining fairness to students
from all economic classes is per-
haps the most difficult part of (tee
termlnlng college financial aid pac-
kages.

Dean of Admissions and StudentFi~
nancial Aid D, Nicholas Ryan re-
cently explained some ol the prob
lems to the 88:3, and described
some of the efforts now being under
taken to combat these difficulties.

All colleges and universities in the
nation base their financial aid pack-
ages on one of two need analysis
forms-~the Parent’s Confidential
Statement (PCS) ol the College Sche
oiarship Service (CSS) or the Fam-
ily Financial Statement of the Arri-
erican College Testing Program
(ACT) CSS is a membership or-
ganization, while ACT provide.
it) million to colleges and univer-
si as on a contract basis.

Grinnell is a member of the CSS,
an arm of the College Entrance
Examination Board (CEEB). Stus
dents applying to the school,orGri-
nnellians, who are Seeking renewal

of their financial aid, must fill out
a copy of the PCS each year. These
forms are processed by computer,
with results returned to Grinnell
by mid-March.

Ryan explained that there had been
a number of complaints from css
member institutions that the organ—
ization’s new need guidelines (which
were to have been used for aid
awarded in the 1973-1974 academic
year) were discriminating against
middle class families,

“No one can argue against the poor
est applicants being taken care cl
first. But the new curves (which
give financial aid officers a uni—
form guide to the amount ol money
a lamily should contribute to its
children's education) hit hardest at
private, iiigh»cost institutions like
orinnell.”

Ryan explained that, had the new
curves been implemented, it would
have meant that a family with a
yearly income of $15,000 and three
children would have been expected
to contribute $400 more towards

Rent Study Continues

by an sne stall writer

Beginning soon for those planning
to live offecampus in Gi-innell. and
not much later for the rest at us,
is the ordeal ol searching and signs
ing for an apartment

The problem of renting in Cirin~
nell was examined last semester
in conjunction with ISPIRG (Iowa
Student’s Public Interest Research
Group) as part of its consumer
protection program

There are two types ot lenses
used in Grinnell 7 oral and writ-
ten. oral leases are generally not
used for periods of more than one
year and the only legal provision
is that either party be given thirty
days notice about departure Al»
though oral leases are as binding
as written leases they are more
easily broken and harder to prove
in court As a result, students
living in apartments under an orztl
lease are more likely to run into
problems such as: harassment, lite
tte or no action on repairs, and
changes of contract upon sale of
the dwelling to :1 different land
lol

Wiitten leases on the other hand
often provide more protection for
the landlord, because it is the lands
lord or his/her lawyer who devise
the lease. Many landlords Write
their own lease or add their own
Clauses to city leases which are
unconscionable, unenforceable, and
possibly illegal. This is not true of
all landlords, but it is wise to have
someone who knows the law check
the lease before it is signed Some
outstanding clauses that are unen—
forcelible are moral Charactei‘cln—
uses; “pet deposits," liens, orties,
on personal property beyond those
mentioned by law loi- extreme Case
es; freernccess clauses; and many
others.

There are some precautionary
measures that can be taken, for
example, some landlords habitu-
ally retain the damage tee oi sc-
curity deposit. The only way to be
certain to get it back is to make
a checklist and have the landlord
sign it in agreement

—:not a great deal of money, but
Often enough to tip the scales ngaine
st a student's enrolling or remain
ing at Grinnell.

Instead, it has been inlormally
agreed among CSS institutions that
updated curves based on last year’s
system may be employed in deter-
mining tinancial need

Ryan, who is a member of the CSS
Committee on Need Assesnient Proe
cedures (CNAP), told the still that
the Committee will be reviewing
the entire need assessment system
with an eye towards making it more
equitable to all classes of family

An added problem, however. is
that the lederai government requires
that results from the PCS and the
FPS must be within $100 fora given
case Ryan noted that, ii the private
groups are unable to work full such
a system. the government will do
it for them~“somctlllng nobody
wants”.

Ryan added that complete equit-
flhility is almost impossible to ll,

This information and legal facts
will be available in the Office of
Student Affairswithinthe next couple
of weeks. This type of information,
consisting ofli i~enter'sblble,cheok-
list, model lease, and more specitic
information about Grinnell, can pro—
vide some assistance about what a
rentel"s rights and responsibilities
are

The housing and rent study disV
covered occasional cases of dis-
criminntion against students ingen-
ei‘al, unmarried studentswho wantto
live together, and Blacks. Hopefully,
the information provided by the 0f-
lice of Student Affairs will be of
help to those students who are con,
sidering renting off-campus.

The All-Campus Judicial Council
held an informal session last Mon-
day night to resolve a dispute con—
cerning an incident last December
in Cowles dining hall.

Complainants Arnie Peters, Terry
Seeberger, and Mark Kostbade char-
ged Gates with “intimidation of stue
dents and creating a general nui»
sance while eating" and “interfer-
ing with the students‘ right to eat.”
Last December ll, said the come
piaint. the three were disturbed
while dining because of ”being strr
uck by pellets that were fired from
a blowegun type device in the pos-
session of Butch Gates.”

The case had been held over from
last semester because of the late-
ness of the incident. Monday's ses-
sion was informal and closed to our
servers. Defendant Gates appeared
munching on a stick of celery and
wearing a sign saying, “Free the
SAGA one.”

After a protracted discussion, the
plaintiffs decided to drop all charges
against Gates, in return for an apol-
ogy.

While the Council decided in the
hearing to drop all charges, Coun-
cil Chairman John Potts noted that
Gates did apologize for his actions.
in a statement released Tuesday
the Council noted that:

The Judicial Council wishes to
point out that since this incident
preceded the public warning to the
college that “land fights" would
not be tolerated, and in view of
the tact that the accused was at
no time asked to desist, it lelt
that a lormal hearing was not ape
propriate in this case without a
prior attempt at resolution at the
dispute However, the Council em-
phasizes that any similar violations
will be dealt with more severely
in the future

Joli Prospects Brighten

by in sun stall writer

A survey of 672 employers around
the nation shows that they plan to
hire to percent more college grad
uates in 1973 than they did last
year, the College Placement Coune
on reported last month.The employe
ers, which represent all types of
Job categories, estimatedthey would
hire 62,290 new college graduates
this year as opposed to the 53,660
they actually hired last year.

The 101) category experiencing the
largest was that for engineers, En-
gineering majors at the bachelor’s
degree level will be hired at a 27
percent increase over last year.
Overall the survey shows that the
respondents expect to hire is per-
cent more bachelor’s candidates

than last year. ,
in the category where no partic-
ular college curriculum is speci-
fied, employers expect to hire 16
percent more persons this year. The
outlook for students in the sciences,
mathematics, and other technical
disciplines should improve by about
17 percent, although candidates with
non-technical training other than
business are expected to find the
market only four percent better.
of the 21 employer groups included
in the survey, aerospace, metals,
and chemical companies expect the
most significant increases. Food
and beverage processing, research
and consulting firms, and local and
state governments expect to see
fewer people hired than last year.
