The first two are unlikely. This
leaves the third: at taulty process.
There is a great flaw in the way
major decisions are reached here.
That ﬂaw is secrecy. Closed meetr
ings and reasons which “cannot be
discussed publicly,” as Gregory
Guroii put it, have no place By
their very nature they destroytrust,
it is not possible to trust someone
who feels he has to hide the manner
in which he makes decisions that
affect you

lithe Executive Council wantstobc
trusted by Students (and, I suspect,
by some [acuity as well) it should
open its meetings.

This, however, will not always be
desirable, A professor or'illstruc-
tor should no more be subjected to
having his academic ability so crit-
icized, These are semi»private mats
ters,

Therefore, the Executive Council
should open only those meetings wh-
ich it feels would proﬁt and beher
tit the community. Hopefully it will
seek to maximize the number of
open meetings, Basically, I would
think, the Council would want, as
a general rule, to hold open those

(from page 1)

meetings dealing with policy, to
close those dealing with person-
hel, and to vary those dealing with
programs as circumstances seemed
to warrant

In closed meetings, whatever their
subject, there whould be nonvoting
student observers Theseobservers
should be the President of SGA,
the Vice Presidents oi SGA, theAll-
College EPC delegate elected at
large, and the Student Coordinator,
The iirst three should be preselit
because they are elected represen—
tatives oi the students; the Student
Coordinator because the nature of
his job requires it.

Whenever the Executive Council
makes a closed meeting decision,
the President oi SGA and at least
one of the other [our should have
to assent. lithe President is ab—
sent he should dESignate one of the
others as his proxy and the assent
oi the proxy plus one oi the res
maimng three should he required.

It the President and one oi the
other tour observers do not as-
sent to the Executive Council's de-
ciston, then the Council should have
to hold a well»publicized open meet-
ing on the subject at a convenient
place and time. At the close of that
meeting, the Executive Council Cour

New System Has little Impact

Despite predictions oi an enormous increase in cases or academic

cases put before the Academic standing Committee did not yump tremen-
dously. The Registrar’s Dirice recently released a three-year comparison

1d go ahead and make its decision,
Voting publicly by roll call.

This would not provide students
with a veto, or even a Vote, on the
Council. it would provide the Pres-
ident oI SGA, or the other [our ob-
servers when they acted unanimous
ly, with the power to compel the
Council to hold an open meeting
beiore making a decision.

It the Executive Council has any
Confidence at all in students, it
should not Object to this method
oi assuring Student input into deg
cisions

It may obiect, because it may not
have that confidence in us, It may
not trust us to act in a respon-
sible way, And that may be the
reason it is not trusted,

There is no reason why this can»
not be an open campus. There is
no reason why old traditions have
to stand in the way ot new Come
petehcles. And there surely is no
reason our iaculty ought to have
anything to fear lrom giving stu-
dents regular, iormal input into all
phases oi the college‘s operations.

tion can only result in greater hos—
tility and continued unrest.

Historically, students have gained
their immediate demands by use at
such intimidation only because ad-
ministrators have been moral cue
wards, and by allowing themselves
to be bullied, have demonstrated
their bankruptcy oi leadership.

Just as suppression Di political
speech is taken as meaning the
sensor's [ear of having to expose
his depraved policy to open debate.
the use of force in backing demands
should be viewed as fear at the ins
ability to demonstrate the rationale
ity and soundness or the demands
in an open forum,

In opposition to this view many
contend that the use of force is ne-*
cessary in changing the establish-
ment. when the establishment on
campus counters this argument by
either a blanket ofsilence, glittering
generalities, or by yielding to mass
intimidation, they only serve to rid-
icule themselves and to feed the
dissenters ammunition.

It’s been Said that College tile is
a sort oi ivory tower, remote and
removed from the “real" world.
The Student power issue, however,
points to the very opposite, Just
as there’s no promise oi security in
life, and you must seek and estab-
lish your own security because no-
body’s going to give it to you, so
too in academia, there’s nopromise
ot a full and rewarding educationand
it you expect one, the realities or
college lite demand that you must
go out or your way to light and win
it ior yourseli.
