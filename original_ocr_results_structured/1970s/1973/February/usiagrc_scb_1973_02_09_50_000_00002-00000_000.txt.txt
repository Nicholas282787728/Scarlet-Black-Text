Daniel Offers Specialized Therapy

by Sherilyn Lee

“During the first semester, we
generally see more treshrnen. ln
the second semester, we usually
see more seniors, and there are
times when we see more people,
for example, a few weeks aiter
the first semester grades come
out," reﬂected Dr. John Daniel,
executive director and clinical psyr
ohologist of the Poweshick County
Mental Health Center,

Located On the fourth floor of the
Grinnell General Hospital at 4th
Avenue and Reed, the Center is sep—
arated irom' the Grinnell College
community by eight city blocks and
an old elevator with two doors which
need to be securely shut in order
to operate. Yet for the past Six or
seven years, the Mental Health
Center has emoyed an aIfiliation
with the College in the Iorm of a
contract. This contract enables the
Center to provide shcrtrterm stric-
tly coniidential counseling to stur
dents, five at no cost. Following that,
if there is a need, fees are indivr
idually arranged and can rangei‘rom
50¢ an hour to $25 an hour.
Counsillng may take the tom of
individual therapy or group therr
apy, depending on each individual
case. "One of the advantages of
group therapy,” commented Dr.

tain the Peace Collective would back
the activities if asked to do so,
Frost, a eta—director of the Col~
lective, noted that the decision to
protest the recruiter's presence on
the campus was his own.

The Peace Collective c07director
cited three reasons for Tuesday’s
demonstrations: "the militaristic,
imperialistic, sexist, racist, and
fascist nature of the Marine Corps",
the fact that “the Marine Corps
presence on the campus is actively
offensive to a number of Grinnell-
ians”, and because such demonstra-
tions are a “consciousness-raising
activity".

Frost answered criticism of the
Peace Collective's stand against the
Marine recruiters by noting that,
while he would personally preler
to have such recruiters banned, he
feels they may be allowed on the
campus if other views are allowed
equal expression.

Kurz answered similar Criticism
by saying that it is the views of
”peaceful and gentle” people which
are usually suppressed, and that
“college campuses should remain
pure of military propaganda”.

Successful

Career Services Office director
Marjory Daly noted that, despite
the two demonstrations, the recrui»
ter’s Visit to Grinnell could be
considered a success Seven stu-
dents signed up for interviews on
Tuesday and two~thirds of these
have also arranged for physical
examinations.

She added that a number of Grins
nell students apologized for the be,
havior of those protesting the Mare
ine visit. Several came to the Care
eer Services office to apologize to
Captain Patrow in person, and ot-
hers have asked her to convey their
apologies to him,

Daniel, "is that it hrongs the sell
out. on the other hand, if a per-
son is in a real crisis situation,
the group may not be helpful for
the person may be too involved in
his own problems to respond to
others.”

presently, Dr. George Castore,
clinical psychologist, and his wife,
Jean, a social worker, lead the two
therapy groups on campus. The Cen—
ter is also staffed by Mary Kohl,
MD, who works part-timeand serr
was as the medical director.

in considering the ways the Gen
ter handles cases, Dr. Daniel de-
liberated: “I don’t think the Cen-
ter as an institution or the indivr
iduals here prescribe to a specific
character theory, type of psycho»
therapyvthat is, we're not rigirian
psychoterapisis or behavior thera—
pists...

“I know what we’re not, but tryr
ing to say what we are is the difr
ficult part...”

Choosing his words careiully, he
continued, “In general, our orien-
tation is a nonrorganic one, one in
which we feel that problems are e57
sentially learned difficulties, with
strong emphasis on inter-personal
learning, so that. the therapy re-
lationship itself can be important
as a bridge in changing a negative
selﬁimage. It can become a model
for a more open relationship, and
also through group therapy, the per
sun can test others' reactions and
evaluations, and try out new modes
of behavior.”

To Increase

by Steve Nunn

Norris residents may soon hear a
lot of noise,

City officials plan to start testing
the new air raid siren system next
month with the onset of the tornado
season.

The system, which has one unit
at Park and 10th near the Norrises
and one at Harrison and Park in the
southern part 0! town, will go off
once a day {or a week, then once
a week, and finally once a month
for some time thereafter, Bill Per
ters, Grinnell‘s police chiefanddir—
actor of civil defense, told the son.

The tests are being held to famile
iarize people with the system's two
sound patterns, one for tornados
and one ior enemy attack.

A third pattern, to signal a tire,
was dropped when the Fire Depart—
ment decided it would rather con-
tinue to use its old siren at the ﬁre
station for this purpose.

One or two additional sirens may
be placed later in the west part at
town, according to City Manager Ted
Clauser.

The system cost $10,000 to in‘
stall. Halt that cost was borne by
the iederal government and Ilaliwas
split between the city and the Jun—
ior Chamber of Commerce.

led Chair, he said thoughfully, “What
did it last year, but i haven't had
the time to do it this year--is to
conduct a therapy group made up
of about ten to fourteen people
from both the college and the comm
munity. Last year it gave them all
an opportunity to look at different
types at problems, and dilterences
in values and views of life.

Before working with the Center,
Dr. Daniel was involved in hospir
tals with both in-patients and out»
patients, but presently, about on-
third of his work, as computed by
the amount of cases and time spent,
is now done with students, while
the rest of it is devoted to com-
munity activities. He estimates that
that the Center sees about 10% DI
the student body each year. Last
year, the count was l39 Students
ans this year, he predicts, will
“probably be the same, perhaps
slightly more.”

Having worked with the Poweshiek
County Mental Health Center for
the past five years, he notes that
the “rather typical concerns”about
self—image, developing a set of val-
ues eﬂective to them, conflicts with
parents, and dissatisfactions in peer
relations have not changed, butperr
haps their supericial manifestations
have, For instance, not many come
in anymore and tiewail the war and
their disillusionments with the coun-
try.

“If this reilects ageneral apathy,"
contemplated Dr. Daniel, resting his
hands on his chin, ”I think that is
sad.”

Flag To Be At Full Mast

by Mike Breed

First on, I would like to correct
an error of omission which I made
last week. In addition to the sub-
jects mentioned, the Joint Boards
spent a good deal of time on the
housing proposals for next year,
which came from the Housing Com-
mittee. People have wanted to know
where the responsibility lies for
deciding which dorms will be COred
etc.'; 5 caetc.; proposals comeirt
mittee and go to the Joint Boards.

This general lack of knowledge
about the committee structure and
what it does is a problem which has
plagued sen tor many years. Many
of thedecisions which come outseem
to be proclamations from a distant
deity but are actually the results
oi hard work by committees cone
tainmg students, faculty, and admin,
istrators,

In the next three weeks I plan to
embark on a review of the entire
committee structure, in hopes
committee structure, in hopes that
it will iniorm people where pros
posals come irom, and also in hopes
that some of the weaknesses will

come to light and be corrected,

Three new officers have assumed
SGA positions. Mark walderhaug
is the new Assistant Student Aud-
itor, In Clark Hall, Barb Mills
has taken over the Presidency and
Elaine Carey the Vice-Presidency.
Melinda McComb has resigned as
President.

This week, the Board decided by
a 74H vote to not fly the iiag at
hali»mast or with crepe any longer.
The ﬂag has been ﬂying in mourns
ing since Spring, 1969, because of
the Viet Nam war. The original
resolution was worded “until the
end of the war”, and there was
some debate as to whether or not
the war is over.

Constitutional debate Centered av
round proposals by John Hanson
to streamline the bureaucracy by
eliminating positions such as the
Vice»Presidents. This proposal and
another consolidating the Auditor
and Treasurer were defeated. Dee
bate was cut short by a call for
quorum and will continue next week
on Article II.

Pei Board Receives Complaints

by Bill Glaser

Tuesday night the Pet Board met
for the first time to discuss how
they would enforce the pet policy
and to act on three pet complaints
that they had already received.

The members of the Pet Board
are Mark Butterman, a freshman,
Sam Clemons, a senior, and Nina
Adams, a Resident Advisor in Youn-
kers.

All three members of the Pet
Board wish to make clear that
they are not antispets. They have
all been or still are pet owners
themselves. They would like to
stress, however, that owning pets
is a privilege and not a right.

The Pet Board is concerned that
pets be well taken care of and the
pets dc not infringe on the rights

at non-pet owners. ”it was a quese
ticn,” Said Clemons, “whether to
have no pets at all or have pets
with regulations. Since there are
regulations now and pets are al-
lowed, the Pet Board is a neces—
sity.”

One problem the Pet Board is
havmg is that people on campus
are not taking the Pet Board and
pet policy seriously. There are
still many unregistered pets. Pet
owners should realize that unre—
gisteted pets will be picked up
sooner or later by the college dog
catcher, Mike Sugarman (ext. 677)
and they will be fined it this hap—
pens. In fact, the Pet Board has ale
ready fined two pet owners, Pierre
Barbeau and Keith Fort, $599 each
ici- having an unregistered pet.
