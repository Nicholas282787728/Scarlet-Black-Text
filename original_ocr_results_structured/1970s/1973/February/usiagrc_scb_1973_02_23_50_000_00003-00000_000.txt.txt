J-B Quits And Goes Home

by Mike Breed

ln a surprise action'Wednesdziy
night the propased constitution was
defeated by the House Presidents.
This came after three weeks of dev
bate which had centered around the
need for a more farrl'eaching ree
Structuring of the .1713 than the new
constitution presented. The meeting
culminated when John Pfeifer, Vice-
President and a principal mover
behind the writing of the new docs
ument came out against the bill
which he helped to develop.

The constitutional debate had also
been marked by a lack oi interest
from the student body at large and
the house presidents in particular,
The previous two weeks' meetings
had been adjourned because a quor-
um failed to show, and this week's
meeting was almost adjourned for
the same reason.

House President Hanson called for
a quorum when the final vote came
on the constitution, reasoning that it
was so important an issue that the
whole body should vote. He was,
however, persuaded to withdraw his
call and the final vote was taken,
with only House Presidents Lich-
tenberger and Brooks voting for the
proposed constitution.

The meeting was adjourned ime
mediately after the vote, over v.1:
Pfeffer‘s plea that the HrP’s stick
around to discuss the more exten»
sive reforms that they evidently
wanted. Many ofthe Presidents were
heard commenting as they left the
meeting that they’d never go again,
and the future of the Joint-Board
for the remainder of the year is in
doubt,

It appears that most of the House-
Presidents are demoralized and feel

that there is no point in trying to
get reforms in the little time that
is left in their term. Although Vice-
President Walter spoke eloquently
and movingly for work towards es-
tablishing a student-faculty Senate
the feeling on the part of most of
the HrP’s is simply that had such
proposals been made at the begins
ning of the year progress may have
been possible, but now they feel a
great deal of cynicism about the
chances for progress.

It appears that the SGA Cabinet
(Pfeffer, Walter, and Kugisaki)came
too late to important realizations
about the power position oi stu-
dents, Hope tor reform now lies
in next year's administration.

Whatever the need for greater
change, the new constitution did
represent a concrete improvement
over the old. it was written in clear
language, was as briet as possible.
and was probably the best possible
document considering the theories
of governance on whichit was based.
With such a slight probability for
major change, it seems a shame
to totally dump an improvement.

1 did promise to write about the
EPC'S this week, and even though
the more important issue in theJ»E
precluded a more extensive dis-
cussion, it still seems appropriate
to at least outline the structure.
There are three levels to the EPC
structure.

The first of these is the departs
ments. The nature and actions of
the departmental EPC’S varies grer
atly from departmenttodepartment;
in some departments they are rel»

atively inactive. while in others they

Alternate State Of The Union

Grinnell's Peace Collective is sponsoring the Alternate State of the
Union Symposium as an alternative to President Nixon's mum-part
State of the Union message, which is currently being delivered on paper
to Congress and to the nation in short radio addresses,

Organizers of the event say that the President is afraid to face the Con-
gress and the nation. They hope that the week long symposium which
begins on Tuesday will, in the words of Len Kurz, give ”the people the
chance to say what they think the state oi the country really is".

The program is open not only to students and faculty. but also to towns»
people»and special efforts are being made to attract the latter group.
President Leggett and College Relations Director William Deminoff have
both provided public relations help to the Peace Collective for the event.

Walker Emphasizes Quality, Communications

by Steve Nunn

Continuing the academic excellence of the College and re—
ducing the communication gap that exists among members
oi the college community: these are the goals Waldo Walker
has set himself as he embarks on his tenure as Dean of the
College.

As Dean Walker is assuming a new set oi responsibil es.
While he shared duties with former Dean Joseph Wall,
Walker handled the business side of administration while
Wall dealt with academic matters. Now Walker, assisted
by Associate Dean James Hamilton, oversees both areas.

The old divided jurisdiction was scrapped because it was
specially designed for Wall and Walker and was considered
unsuitable for any other team,

”Major Goal”

in an interview this week Walker assessed the priorities
facing the College.

To keep its students, Grinnell has to offer them some-
thing they can’t get elsewhere. Walker sees this something
as “an excellent liberal arts in education in a personalized
atmosphere.”

This is his “major goal,” and it has two basic componr
ents.

The first is a quality faculty. Grinnell’s faculty not only
has academic and intellectual expertise but actually tea»
ches, which is not true in every college and university.
Recent efforts to limit faculty workloads by regulating
the independents they can supervise have been in the ine
terests of raising this personal quality of the education
here, Dean Walker says.

The facultyrstudent ratio is also tied to personalized
learning, of course. It is now about 1/11 or 1/12 and will
stay about the same next year.

Actually, it will improve slightly. Plans are to increase
the student body by about la, the faculty by 3 (in Russian,
Math, and History).

Flexibility

A second component of quality in education is flexibility
and “continuous self-assessment" to meet changing needs,
according ,to Walker.

‘This selfrassessment currently is taking the iorm of a
reappraisal of all departments, both by themselves and by
outside consultants.

These consultants are not members of professional “cone
sulting firms” but are academicians in the discipline who
are brought in individually to study the department.

The program was begun by the Dean's oiiice, which gets
the recommendations from the department and the con~
sultants and then synthesizes its own recommendations
from these raw materials.

These recommendations from the Dean’s office, while
they do not have the force of edicts, are more or less
binding upon the departments concerned, Walker says.

So far the Art, Biology and Political Science departments
have been evaluated in this program. Psychologyand English
are next.

The recent review of the Communications department was
not undertaken this way because it involved the question
oi the department's continued existence, not merely its
revisionr

Off-Campus

Off-campus programs are likewise beingre-examined, with
the focus on their academic and intellectual quality. Walker
has said he favors “slowly expanding" the number of students
going on off campus programs and the number oi programs
available Particularly, he thinks there need to be more
on campus opportunities for languages

The offrcampus sector of education may also become
more formally organized, perhaps even, getting its own
Director of Off-Campus Study, says Walker.

Communication

Walker’s other goal, better communication, is one that
involves faculty, Students, and administration The lack of
mutual understanding among the three is, he says, "really
critical,"

“There is a lot of erroneous information that only com-
munication can clear up But there is an entropic thrust
to communication, a tendency for it to break down."

Formalizing channels of communication among the fac-
ulty, administration and students might improve this but
might also stiﬂe what communication exists, he says.

“People get dragged out going to all those meetings.”

Walker apparently sees no immediate solution to the
problem of communication and erroneous information, al—
though he cites the newly instituted open forums as possible
palliative. Faculty as well as students are urged to attend
those meetings, and Walker says they would be weekly
rather than bisweekly if there were enough interest.

“But these things blow hot and cold: if there’s a hot issue,
you can get 00 people out to carp at the Dean. lfthere’s
not, they may just sit and doze."

Admissions

In admissions, an effort is underway to increase the num-
ber of Iowa students and to decrease the number of foreign
students.

About 90% of the student body is now outrofrstate, and
the administration has been making efforts for several
years now to increase the number or Iowans who come to
Grinnell. The number is growing but is nowhere near the
adv/044% it was ten years ago.

The number of foreign students is being curtailed, not
because the ioreign student program has been unsucceSSA
fu1--Walker says the contrary is trite--but because it
is more useful to apply the college’s resources domes-
tically.

Walker said about three needy domestic students Could
come to the college for the amount of financial assistance
that goes to bring a single toreign student.

Money

The College’s financial situation is not critical, Walker
reports The endowment is about $20 million and grows
ing, both in contributions and in market value. The opera—
ting budget is about $5.3 million.

This means “we have tohustlethebucks,"Walker says. But
he adds, “That’s okay when you have peoplewho can do it.”
The overall financial state of the college is “a lot better
than a lot of other Schools and above average for midwest
colleges," in Walker’s estimation.

The impression one gets in talking to Walker is die man
who is, right now, primarily concerned with generating
ideas. Some of his ideas may not work out; some may be
of debatable value.

But he seems to be concerned with the College and its
continuing improvement and to see his proposals as a cone
tinuing search ior that cat.
