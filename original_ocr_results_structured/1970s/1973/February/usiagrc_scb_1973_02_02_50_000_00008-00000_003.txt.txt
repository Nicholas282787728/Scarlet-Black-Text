Despite diflerences in the attitudes or Heide
Whetan and Lenore Dnrltee, they both ieel
deﬁnitely that a woman has to be hired on
her own merits. Both also stress the de-
sirability (ii a iul 'me position over a
part—time or fill-in job.

Being the wile oi a faculty member has
caused a tew problems tor either in terms
or tamiiy hassles (except babysitting prob-
lems) or relations with other faculty or
faculty wives. Neither one seems to View
herself in these terms at all but each sees
herself as a woman pursuing her own goals
and seeking to do What she wants to do.

Ms. whelan, who is working on her PhD
and teaching one course (or Grinnell, is
seeking a position elsewhere where whe can
put her years of learning to the best use.
She said she would apply for a mil-time
position here ii' one were available but
went on to say, ”I’m not married to Grin-
hell.”

The importance of finding a position for
Ms. Whelan is in pan due to net feeling
that husband and wife Should share in earn-
ing a living. “I don’t believe my husband
should be responsible ior providing {or
my maintenance."

Not teaching now because she'salsowork-
ing on a PhD, Ms. Durkee (eels differently
about Grinnell. ”I like Grinnell, I’m at
home here," she said and added that she
had found her part-time teaching exper-
ience here very rewarding. Beiore decid-
ing to go on for her PhD, Ms. Durkee taught
Introductory Biology labs, a plant anatomy
course, and assisted in plant physiology
labs.

When asked ii she would accept a lull-
time job elsewhere ii none were available
at Grinnell, she replied that she’d consider
it very strongly. But “it would have to be
an awi'ully good job" in order for her to
[ace commuting from Grinnell. “Any woman
continuing her education would like the
responsibility oi a full-time jo ,” she}
said.

A panrtime position here at Grinnell
has its advantages though, according to
Ms. Durkee. She mentioned the opportunity
(or research that teaching partvtime would
provide.

Ms. Durkee cited both her husband and her
previous teaching experience as encourage-
ment for going on for her PhD. She praised
her husband's understanding and helptu1~
ness, saying, “i was a liberated woman
before women’s liberation came into
vogue."

Both these women see themselves as ed-
ucated and qualified individuals, eachvlorh-
ing toward a delinite goal. They seek the
salisiaction that attaining a long sought
after and worked for goal would bring to
anyone.
