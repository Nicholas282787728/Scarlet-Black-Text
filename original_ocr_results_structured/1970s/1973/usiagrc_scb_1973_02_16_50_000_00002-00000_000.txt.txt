The Committee Structure

by Mike breed

Beiore we get started with the
promised review of the committee
structure, Wednesday night’s meets
ing deserves some comment, The
meeting started on on an even keel
with the Walter and Pleffer reports.
The only item of substance was that
the EPC had recommended not to
raise the 48-hour per department
limitation on the number of credits
which may be counted towards grad~
nation.

Then, the Joint Board had to talk
about what to do about the TV fund,
which is down to less than $5.0 .
(This means that if one Of the tubes
on campus breaks, there will be
no money available to [ix it) The
J»B first voted against establish-
ing a committee to look into the
matter by 3-44, then decided not
to send the matter to the Student
Services committee because action
there would be slow, so linally
House President John Hanson vol-
unteered to head a committee to
look into the matter, ll something
doesn’t happen on this, we'll soon
be Without televisions.

At this point John Seeley 0t KDIC
came to speak about giving a sal-
ary to the News Director at the
station. A motion to reconsider
taking the salary out oi General
Budget and Reserves, which had
been defeated last week, was put
on the ﬂoor. Greg Dickey called
tor a quorum, which was not pre—
sent, and the meeting undecorously
broke up. So much for the 1713.

This week I intend to talk brieﬂy
about the StudentrFaculty commit;
tees, next week about the EPC'S,

and the week after that about the
Committee A structure Each oi
the student-faculty Committees con-
sists at students chosen by the JrB
and faculty chosen by the adminis-
tration, The student to faculty ratio
varies, depending on the iunciion
of the committeenstudents have a
majority on the Judicial Council
but are outnumbered four to two
on the Art Acquisition Committee
These committees are listed on
the bulletin board outside the book-
store, so I won’t bother to Cate»
iogue all the committees or this
nature, but instead will explore
how they iunction,

Alter the student members are
selected by the J-B, each come
mittee remains inirly automonnus
of the J-E. Student members bloom»
mittees have been reluctant to file
regular reports about their actin
ties with the Student Coordinator,
mainly because many at the come
mittees meet rarely or irregularly
and progress is slow, A report at
the current activities of these come
mlttees is now available in the Stun
dent Coordinator‘s oihce, however
This communication problem has
been the main complaint about the
studentrlaculty committees. All in
all, they iunction iairly smoothly
and eiiiciently and are a good
point ior students to have input into
the decision making structure. Un-
iortunately, since much or the plan»
ning done is long range and most
students only serve tor a year or
at most two years on a commit»
tee, the input is limited by a lack
of continuity on the committee.
