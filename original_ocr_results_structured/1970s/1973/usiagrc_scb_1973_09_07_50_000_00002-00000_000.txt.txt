The lettuce boycott has become
an issue on the Grinnell campus
once more, but this time table gre
_apes and Guild and Gallo wines are
also on the United Farm Workers
boycott list. 1 .

According to Robert Quint and
Charles Becker, it is the responsi-
bility at every student to get involr
yen in this boycott.

“If anyone supports this boycott
the College will," said Becker,
who is a sophomore. “Any place
that went 95% McGovern can be
expected to support the boycott.”

Students are being asked to boy
cott Guild and Gallo wine because
45% of this wine is consumed by
students. ”If students could get this
thing going, it will. be a good start
to get those Gallo contracts back,”
stated Becker.

Also planned this year, arepicket-
ing oi supermarkets in major Iowa

, cities.
Local stores will not be picketed

because, according to Becker, “This ,

would raise more anti opinion than
pro at. this point, We don’t want
to alienate the town."

Qlliiit describes the boycott as a
“moral" issue. ”Students have been
actively opposed to other indecenr
oies like the war in Vietnam," he
said. “l’m optimistic enough to be
lieve they’ll shake off their apathy
and put wide scale support behind
another injusticenthis time closer
to home.”

Last year, Grinnell students agreed
to boycott lettuce. SAGA complied
by not buying non-UFW iceberg let-
tuce. “They were really very coop-
emtive.” Becker recalled.

And Quint added that there are
other lettuces available that have
more nutritional value. A vegetar—
iah at one of the SGA meetings
brought up this point.

”The sacriiice is so small and
would help so many people. i yust
can’t see any question to not sup
porting the boycott," Quint remar-
ked, "it's urgent that they do so‘
because a lot oi power is now
attempting to kill our union.”

short-lived because a few months
later the teamsters moved inhehind

fields and negotiated so-called “SWr
eetheart contracts" - the Teams
sters went to bed with management.
The lettuce boycott was on.”

“This year on April 15 the first
of the threeryear table grape coils
tracts expired. The Teamsters
moved in again and stole our con-
tracts,“ Quint continued, The UFW
moved out or the fields to strike

] SAGA Views Boycott

by Sarah Morse

Director oi College Services Ralph
Pomerenk and Food Service Dir»
ector Jerry Ramaker expressed
concern over the effects 0! contin-
uing the boycott on non-UFWlettuce
in separate interViews recently,

“if students decide to continue the

' boycott," Ralph Pomerenk said,

”they must realize that almost no
head lettuce will be available ”

The boycott. proposed last year by
Charlie Becker and agreed upon by
a l7»0-l SGA vote, was extended
ior to days this semester,

The Joint Boards have recommen-
ded to SAGA Food’Service that the
boycott against‘ non-UFW lettuce
and table grapes be extended for one
month (Aug. 26—Sept. 26) and at the
end oi the month, the Boards, upon
request irom a group oi students.
iwill decide whether or not to e -
tend the boycott through the remain-
der oi the year.

“i don’t know why people keep

calling it iceberg lettuce,” Jerry
Ramaker said. “Iceberg is simply
a brand name head lettuce."

SAGA can still purchase leaiiet-
tuces such as Romaine or Boston
and some urw head lettuce.

“We have two suppliers" Ramar
ker stated, “Midwest oi Cedar Rae
pids and Hoxie oi Des Moines, Mid:
west has no UFW supplier” and we
are only the customers oi Hoxie
that wants it.

“They have been very helpiul in
trying to get us some, but they
only have it occasionally.”

Although urw lettuce was avail-
able to SAGA last year olmost reg-
ularly, Hoxie hasn't been able to
obtain any this year.

“l’m not very optimistic about
SAGA being able to get any_“

again; to again tight ior the con
tracts that were so difficult to gain
in 1970. The Teamsters are still
in bed with management.”

“Under the UFW, the workers
decide among themselves who gets
the jobs on the basis at senior
ity,” Quint stated. This is not so
in the Teamster contracts, The
UFW also oiiers protection against
pesticides, which the Teamsters
contracts don't offer.

The California Supreme Court de-
creed in 1972 that the dispute he-
lween the two units is not a jur-
lsdlctial dispute. The teamstersdor
n’t represent the workers so the
Court said that the dispute was not
one between two equally legitimate
unions. A poll taken by an inter-'
faith committee found that 85%otthe
workers supported the UFW, 10%
the teamsters and 5% no union at
all,

“it’s a unique union tor the u 3

stilled within a Wide spectrum of
iarmworkers strong sense oi digr
nity and sell respect," Quint re-
marked,

“We do live in a racist society,
Even with the civil rights laws that
have been passed, there still aren’t
civil rights. Even with the child
labor laws, 25% oi the work iorce
in the fields are still under loyears
of age (according to a 1969 Senate
Sub-Committee on Migratory Labor
report). rheregs laws againstpestir
cides too but that don’t mean shit,”
Quint stressed, “The reason tor
these injustices is that authorities
turn their heads and say ‘I don’t
want to get involved’ or that it's
better to take the side of the gro-
wers, the side of the rich."

"The Teamsters are Just the lac-
keys oi the growers’ " Quint con-
tinued. “The growers are the real
problem. They’re tradilinally rac-'
ist.” He said that the growers pres
ler doing business with people such
as themselves » affluent white peor
ple. That is why the Teamsters une
ion appeals to them,

The strike is being held in Cali»'

fornia although conditions are Just
as had in other states. “We’ll
get to the other workers aiter the
Calliornia thing. The boycott and
strike must win ior us again, Gro-
wers respond to economic issues,

Robert Quint on the steps of Crazy House.

They’ll be lorced by necessity to
sit down and talk with the UFW
again because they know it’s that
or no business."

“We don't want to kill the induSr
try," he continued, “Allwe ask (or is.
thai these people be treated with,
some respect,”

The union’s a “real hope” ior
these people with its health and
welfare provisions, added Becker.
“It's absurd that a country as
rich as America should have a
group oi people with a liiespan
rivalling the poorest Atrican counr
tires.”

“The growers can aiiord to pay
a little more on the wage," he said,
“It won't break them and one to
two cents a head for lettuce won’t
hurt anyone as much as it will help
the farmworkers.”

“The UFW has done a lot for the
farmworkers in California,” stat-
ed Becker, “althoughlt‘s still hope

lessly wretched at this point.”
Becker worked boycotting asuper—
market- in Washington, no. this
summer. “1 don’t have much busi-
ness speaking ior the United Farm
Workers because rm not a iarm-
worker People who havebeenthere
can tell the story better than i
can lust by the iact oi their exper—
ience,“ he said. “I think the C0117
ege should bring someone in to
speak on the UFW like'they did
last year."

Quint worked this summer in Hou-
ston, Fort Worth, and Dallas. “I
worked on getting the word out to
people in large urban areas,” he
said He attended union, civic, and
church meetings to tell people about
the United rarm Workers. “when
people iind out what it’s all about
they’re usually sympathetic,” had.
said. “But sometimes it can get,
pretty confusing.”
