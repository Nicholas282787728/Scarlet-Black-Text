A Budda for a mascot, and Ger-
man beer music for practice--this
is a swimming team? it is, and
tonight in the PEG pool, Coach
Ray Obermiller will send his Pioa
neel‘ Swim team into action again-
st Northwest Missouri State. The
meet begins at 4:00. Tomorrow
Grinnell will host the Pioneer
Relays at 1:00.

Obermiller is optimistic and he
appears to have good cause. Lead-
ing the Pioneers is junior Bob Win-
ters, the easy winner ol the zoo
yard individual Medley (wt) in the
MAC meet last year Winters also
copped the 100 and Z00 yard backa
stroke titles last year, and swam
on Grinnell’s third place 400 yd.
medley relay unit. Tom Rowat a-
nother junior is the deiending MAC
champ in the 100 yd. butterﬂy.
He also took second in the 200 ﬂy
and third in the 200 lreestyle Sens
ior diver Larry Huntoon is the
third outstanding returning letter-
man as he was second in the con-
ference diving last year and lirst
two years ago.

Good treshmen are a plus to the
team this year Freestylers Doug
Johnson, IM and butterliyer John
Chambers, and lreestyler andhackr
stroker Frank Wledling provide her
eded support. Weakness in theiree—
style events was primarily responr
sible for a 5—4 dual mark and a
slide to fourth place at the MAC
meet last year. Grinnell took a
25»dual win streak into last year’s
campaign and had ranked in the top
two in coulerence tor the past three
years, This year St, 0121 ranks as
the conlerence lavorlte with Grin-
nell and Knox close behind.
Returning lettermen include Albert
Btesh, Jel'l' Reed, Mark Walderhaug,
Dale Scherler, and diver Ric Day.
The rest at the squad includes Mike
Gelbort, Bill Jollie, Pete Axelrod,
Scott Martin, Kent Ramsey, Paul

Hoopsiers Win One

by Dave Calvert
Grinnell’s b sketball team opened
its tall min on schedule with an
unoilicial scrimmage against a tall
Central College club here last week
and came up with a thrilling 80-78
victory. in countering the tour in—
ches per man height advantage at
Central, Grinnell unleashed an imr
pressive running game. With iorr
wards Dennis Moss and Bill Bail-
ey leading the attack, the pioneers

took a 52-48 lead into halitime.
At the start oi the second half
Grinnell continued its quick tema
poed game and led at one point by
as many as 11 points. The Central
coach then switched to a lull court
press delense and the momentum

switched abruptly. Not having work»
ed specifically on committing the
press in practice yet, Grinnell was
lorced into several turnovers and
the game tightened considerably un-

Wrestlers Ready

by Rick Nigbingale
This year's wrestling team pror
mises to be the best in several
years. Coached by Mo Hunt, the
team is loaded with potential, and
everyone out for the team is an
experienced wrestler. With the ex-
isting talent and attitude the team
should win several mees this sea-
son, thus snapping a long losing
streak. The team should do well
in the league tourney and several
wrestlers could place high in it.
Returning to the line-up from last
year’s team are junior Rick Night-
ingale at 118 lbs, and sophomore
Dennis Walters at 177. Both are
physically stronger and much more
aggressive on the mat this year.
Top lreshnlan prospects are Hosea
Engram at 158 and Josh Hoyt at
126, Both have been tough on the
mat in practice and were excel—
lent high school wrestlers. The
return at Joe Genereux at 142 will
be a big addition to the team.
Genereux is an excellentwrestier,
very strong, and with experience.
Rounding out the team are smart
Berr and Steve Tldwell at 134,
Jack Couch and Mark Genereux at
150, and Johen Hamby and Mike
Darragh at 167. Returning letter—
men Joe Farrell at 118 and Tom
Farr at 126—134 add strength and
depth to the team.

against Simpson, at 7 pm. in the
PEC. Next is a home meet against
Kirkwood on December 11. The
chance of winning either or both
at these meets appears good, The
only thing that might hurt the Pio-
neers is that they may have to
forlelt the 190 and heavy-weight
Classes. Despite the lack at big
men, the wrestling team has good
personnel in the other weight claSr

Grinnell as a bunch of patsi'es. One

was knotted at Wall Coach Edd
Bowers at this point elected to
play for the last shot, shitting the

Pioneer oﬂense into a stall. With
two seconds remaining, junior star
Bailey connected on a 25-foot ju-
mper lor the two point winning
margin.

For Grinnell there were several
good signs. Bailey and Moss, bnth
sidelined last year for various rear
sons, tallied 28 points apiece. Jur
nior Rick Kellar contributed 10
markers. Despite the height dis-

advantage, Grinnell rebounded well,
due to the tough play or centers
Noble Young and Nick Williams.
Forward Jim Casey and guards
Bruce Johnson, Craig Zippe, and

Rick Faust also saw extensiveplay-
ing time. Coach Bowers was pleas-
ed with the team’s play, comment—
ing, "What we‘ve worked on we

did well, which was run and shoot.”
He also expressed some optimism
over this weekend’s William Penn
Tip»oll Tournament. wnile expect-
ing a tough time, he is looking for
a strong team effort.
