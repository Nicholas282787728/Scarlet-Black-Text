Cross Country Takes Fourth Place

The crOSSrcountry team ran its
best race of the year at the right
time to take lourth place at the
Conference meet at St. Olaf. St
Olat won the meet, closely lollowed
by Carleton, with Beloit third.

The [north place finish was a sur-
prise both to us and several other
teams in the conference who had
counted us out, particularly (Joe
and Cornell, both oiwhom hadheaten
us in dual meets this year. Several
factors probably contributed to the
“upset”, but the most important
had to be the strong start of the
whole team, For the first time this
season all ofus went out fairly fast
and found ourselves in the middle
oi the pack at the halfrmile mark.
From that point we stayed pretty
much together and moved up toward
the front ior most oi the race. Anot-
her factor was the course. Gi‘innell

tributed to the faculty, the Commit
tee also observed that the movewas
proposed "in the interests oicalt-
dor and open discussion” and that

“fully open committee meehngsare
unlikely to be in the hestinterests
of the college.”

Anne Walter, VicevPresidentofthe
Student Government Association,
protested the move, observing that
she knew of ”no provocation ior
closing meetings” since no probs
lem with open meetings has ever
occurred. Committees should feel
free to call executive sessions at
specific times, she Said, but the
general prohibition of students is
"not consistentwiththe whole nature
oi the campus.” '

Dean Of Administration Waldo
Walker agreed, recalling that “in
all instances, having open meetings
has added to the function of com-
mittees and has not subtracted from
this function.” The open system,
he said. “has worked admirably,"

This new move, said Walker, would
be a “proliferation of the ‘we’ and
‘they' philosophy.”

Professor of Physics Beryl Clots
felter spoke for the motion, how-
ever, Observing that the “basic
issue is the operability of the Corns
mittee system” rather than the ideas
logical prinClples involved. if large
numbers of peole show up at meet-
ings, he said, the “committee struc-
ture may break down," forcing the
committee to call for closed
sessions and keep out the very peo»
ple who are the most interested
in what is going on.

This analysis, however, was chal-
lenged by Robert Grey, Assistant
Professor of Political Science, who
noted that the committee chairman
has other options than calling a
closed session, such as refusing
to recognize non committee meme
hers present.

Substitute Motion

At this point Professor of Poli—
tical Science Edwin Gilmour pro-
posed a substitute motion, which
would allow all standing committees
of the faculty to be open unless specs
ifically in executive session, An
amendment to the motion by Walker
deleted [our committees from the
proposal, including the Executive
Council, the Budget Committee, the

home courses iIi the conference--
we were ready for the St, Olaf
course, which turned out to be fairly
tough. And oi course, we couldn't
have done it without the New Mexico
State Fight Song.

Dan Hildebrand was disappointed
with his seventh place finish, after
being expected lo take first or
second, He had bad luck in being
boxed in at the start. Then he felt
he had to sprint to catch the leaders
by the mile mark. That was a mis-
take, as he tied up near the end of
the race. Still, he ran Well and had
a good time ior the course. Bob
Brown was 32nd, followed by Bob
Shields in 34th and Torn Howland
35th. Tom ran hard after a conserr
vatlve start in his best race of the
year, Dave Raul) was dlst with Ted

Committee on Faculty Organization,
and the Academic Standing Corns
mittee, since those tour deal pris
marily with the "sensitive" issues
and have no student members. Those
committees, under Walker's amends
ment, could remain closed,

Responded Gilmour: “Of course,
these are the only committees that
make important decisions " The
faculty then began to discuss both
motions simultaneously.

The matter, said Economics Pro-
fessor Robert Voertman, is not a
question oi rights, but a question
of eiiicienoy. “The committee meet-
ing," he said. “is a working strum
ture rather than an open iorum,"
As such the meetings should be
closed.

New Amendment

A vote taken on Walker's amends
ment a few minutes later showed
approval, 37-4.

Guroff at this point proposed a new
amendment to the Gilmour motion,
which would make the four specified
committees open to nonrmember
faculty personnel but not to Stilr
dents. This action, he said, would
merely extend the logic of the pier
vious and should be made in order
that the faculty be consistent. After
speeches in opposition by protessor
of French John Klelnschmidt and
Faculty Chairman Philip Kintner,
however, the Guroii amendment was
voted down 3343,

A vote on Gilmour's substitute mos
tion to allow meetings open unless
specified otherwise was then der
ieated 23730, and the Original mar
tion by Dawson was passed 25718

Soccer Ends
With 2-2 Tie

by Dave Calvert

Grilmell completed the 1972 soccer
season Saturday withadisappointing
2—2 tie here with a vastly improved
Coe team, In the previous meeting
oi the two clubs, on opening day
September 23, the Pioneers had
coasted to it 6-1 rout of the inexpers
fenced Kohnwks C09 closed out the
season on a hopeiul note successive
strong eiiorts against Knox and
Grinnell. The Pioneers ended the
season as Southern Division runner-
ups, behind the undefeated Siwashers
from Knox. Grinnell finished with
four wins, one loss, and three ties.
To everybody’s surprise, the PioV
neers were down 170 as the Second
half began, Pete Horowitz quickly
chipped in his tenth goal of the year.
The score remained knotted at 1-1
until Dave Calvert scored what was
apparently the winning goal with but
seven minutes to play, Four minutes
later, however, a freak Kohawk
score erased the 2—1 advantage and
the disheartened Pioneers were
forced to settle for a tie,

Grinnell fullbacks Roger Kumler,
Glenn Cushing, Andy Boom, and
Larry Goldstein played brilliantly,
accounting for eight or thedeiense’s
30 saves. Halibacks John Hinde,
Rich Lancaster, Ron Spritzer, and
Mion lbangha also played well at
both ends of the field.

TRUSTEES Gran-linen

In rejecting this plan the Board
oi Trustees has, according to local
ISPIRG member Cul‘t Gorrell, “put
us in a sort of limbo,” Without
an established plan ior the funding
of ISPIRG on campus, Grinnell's
position as a member oi the state
board is in yeopardy. Gorrell, SGA
Vice-President Anne Walter, and
ISPIRG Chairperson Mary Jane
Wynn are presently working with
Dean of Administration Waldo
Walker, President Glenn Leggett
and Treasurer Donald Lambie in an
attempt to iormulate a proposal ace
ceptable to the Trustees. The memr
her: hope that an alternate funding
plan, if approved by the Trustees
Via mail vote, can still be in-
stituted here in time for the second
semester.
