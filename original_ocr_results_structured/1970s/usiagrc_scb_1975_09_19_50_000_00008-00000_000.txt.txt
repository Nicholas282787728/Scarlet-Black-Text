Garv Frumkin found himself
steadily under fire, one tally
crediting him with 17 saves in the
game.

During a midweek practice for
the Coe game Pfitsch commented.
“I overestimated the team’s
ability to play longer, We ran out of
gas in the middle of the second half
. i i We have to get our halfbacks to
cover the midfield area better . . ,
Maybe I subbed badly, but that is
simply hindsight on my part, the
other team did play well." In
addition to Fendler, Pfitsch had
praise for St. Thomas, John Loin,
and Tim Hopkins.

Both contests against Coe last
year were one-sided in favor of
Grinnell, So Pfitsch should get a
chance to play some players who
didn‘t get into the Cornell contest

The Grinnell College men's cross
country team opened its season
last Saturday at Coe College by
taking both ends of a double dual
meet against Coe and Cornell. The
Pioneers defeated Coe, 25-33, and
just missed completing a perfect
score against Cornell, upending the
Rams, 16-42.

Grinnell’s freshman phenom,
Scott Burlingame, placed second
overall in the 4 mile run, covering
the distance in 21:59. Tim Caver,
Bill Brown, and Paul McCuliey, all
freshmen, finished third (22:13),
fifth (22:15), and seventh (22:44),
respectively. Junior Neal
Klegerman was Grinnell's fifth
runner to cross the finish line,
completing the race in eighth place
with a time of 22:57. Seniors Russ
Damtoft and Paul Kennedy
finished ninth (23:04) and tenth

(23:26), respectively, for the‘
Pioneers, and were the last
Grinnell runners to count in the
standings.

Lone sophomore Tim DeCoste s
was fifteenth overall, running a ‘
24:00, 4 mile race, and was
followed closely by freshman Dick
Winters (24:02). Steve Silverberg,
Steve McKelvey, Greg Fey, and

with times of 25:07, 25:47, 26:23,
and 26:38, respectively.

Gridders beaten

Grinnell’s Pioneers bowed to Coe
College in both team‘s Midwest
Conference opener, 2477, last
Saturday, but not without showing
numerous signs of a solid football
team. The defense looked par
ticularly sharp and greatly imr
proved over last year’s unit. As
Coach Ron Mitchell said. “With the
exception of five or six plays, the
defense looked very solid."

The Pioneers opened the scoring
with nine minutes gone in the first
quarter when quarterback Paul
Crane connected With end Paul
Delaney for a 63 yard scoring
bomb, Delaney hauled in the pass
at the 35 yard line and outsprinted
two Coe defenders to pay dirt.
Dave Wopat then successfully
kicked for the extra point and
Grinnell finished the first quarter
ahead, 770.

The Kohawks tied the game
early in the second quarter when
quarterback Lyle Nesmeier hit all~
conference running back Dan
Heeren with an 13 yard touchdown
pass. The conversion was good and
the half ended wlth the two teams
deadlocked at 7 apiece.

In the third quarter Coeascol'ed
on their first possession, Nesmeier
passing to end Kevin Enwright tor-
a 14 yard touchdown. The cons
version was successful and Coe led
14-7 barely into the third quarter.

Early in the fourth quarter the

key play, or rather call, of the
game took place. The Pioneers had
moved down to the Coe 26 yard line
and on a fourth and thirteen yard
situation Crane rolled out to pass
and hit Delaney at the Coe 6 yard
line, a Grinnell first down, The
Pioneers were in scoring position,
euphoria was sweeping through the
Grinnell fans.

But wait! The referee was
waving his arms, gesturing the
pass was incomplete. The referee
said Delaney was out of bounds
when he caught the ball, something
the game films clearly disproved,
Not only did Delaney have both
feet in bounds, but the referee had
his back to the play. Head Coach
Edd Bowers said, “That play was
the turning point of the game " The
Pioneers were forced to give up the
ball.

Coe promptly marched 74 yards
for a touchdown making the score
2177. Shortly before the end of the
game Coe scored on a 6 yard field
goal to complete the scoring,

The Pioneers finished with 211
rushing and passing yardage
compared to Coe's ails yards

Coe was essentially bottled up
throughout the first half by a
tenacious Grinnell defense, Coach
Mitchell observed that this year
opposition ball carriers are con-
fronted by four or five defensive
men instead of the one or two as in
past seasons,

As for the Pioneer offense, it still
has some improving to do. Timing
was off a great deal, execution of
plays was sloppy at times, and the
offense often appears
disorganized. Coach Bowers
emphasized that the offensive unit
always requires more time to j
than does the defensive team. 3:

This season the coaching staff
has initiated a new program called
“Pioneers of the Week." Selected
for the Coe game were Tom Goetz,
offensive back, Hosea Engram.,
defensive back, Paul Matecki,
offensive lineman, alld Scott
Fackrell, defensive lineman.

Tomorrow at 1:30 pm. the
Pioneer gridders take on Lake
Forest in the inaugural game on
Rosenbloom Field. Coach Bowers
characterized this contest as “a
big ball game,amust Win.” 7‘
