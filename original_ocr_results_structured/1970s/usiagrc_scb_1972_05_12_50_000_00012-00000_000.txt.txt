Triple Fault
last Week

it was a busy but unsuccessiul
week oi tennis tor the Grinnell
squad as they were deteated by St.
Olat, Carleton, and the University
oi Northern iowa.

The home meet last Friday against
st. cm was by tar the closest
match oi the year. Playing inttie
Phys. Ed, complex because oi the
lovely lowa spring weather, the out-
come was not decided until the third
set or the tinal doubles match where
Brad Vaaales and Ed DeBus were
edged out by the Olai pair. That
made the hunt score 5 to 4 with
the visiting Dies on top Not only
was the tinal score close, but six
or the nine matches went three sets,
with several sets decided on the tier
breaker.

Carlos Mendoza. Dave Beemau, and
Levi Wood each won ttieir singles
matches and Mendoza and Beeman
won their doubles match

The next day the Carleton rackets
men came to town and rubbed out
Grinnell by a score ot a to t

. n .,

The Scarlet and Blatk

Not much can he said about the meet
except that the C i-ls Just had too
much tirepouci Vlilriles and Delilts
were the only Giiunell winners.
Tuesday the Grinnrttinus took on a

strong UNI team that boasts a
ZleZ record and lost 7 to 2 The
team. however, was without the
services or their tirst two men,
Vazales and Debits. Nevertheless,
Drive Beelttit won the No l singles

As has been said at many matches
this seasun, it was Still not a Ster-
ling periormance by our guys.
Nevertheless, Grinnell defeated
conference toes Cornell and Coe
and finished much higher than they
have in the past three ortour years.

One additional note about last Tues-
day: The manager otthe Travelodge
in Coralville is a good man He
gave great treatment to it golf team
with Very little money in their
budget. You should stay there it the

right in the middle OI finals week,
the Squad departs fur Appleton,

In a game such as goii where there
can be so much variation in scores
trom day to day, it would be tough
to predict Grinneii’s prospects at
the Conterence Barring a complete
disaster, however, the team should
be in the thick of the scramble.
A safe bet would be a ﬁrst division
