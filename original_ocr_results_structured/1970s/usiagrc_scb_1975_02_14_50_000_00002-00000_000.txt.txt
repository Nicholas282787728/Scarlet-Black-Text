Governor Ray’s proposal to ex-
pand the Iowa Tuition Grant
program is passed by the state
legislature. The proposal seeks to
increase the Tuition Grant
program from $6 million to $9.6
million.

Currently, two Tuition Grant
proposals are before the State
Educational Committee, Besides
Governor Ray’s 39:5 million
request, the Higher Education
Commission has recommended a
$15 million appropriation.

According to State Senator Joan
Urr, a member oi the ap-
propriations subcommittee oi the
State Educational Committee,
prospects for passage of
“something”or some part oi one of
the proposals appear good. What
exactly is passed will depend upon
the developing economic picture in
Iowa. Orr, Grinnell’s state senatori
said that the state controller was
optimistic about Iowa's economic
projections but others hold a more
pessimistic view.

Orr explained that another
problem involves deciding the size
oi the grants. “By providing
smaller grants, sumo-sham), ins
stead oi the proposed maximum
$1,500 grants, you will be able to
help more people. These will be the
middle income people, who
currently need the money,” she
said. Orr contends that Federal
provisions will help out those who
need larger grants, The present
maximum grant is $1,000 per
student,

According to the governor’s
office, 47 Grinnell students are
presently receiving Tuition Grant
iunds. This represents as per cent
of the 125 Iowa residents enrolled
as full-time students at the college.
Grinnell students obtained a total
of $41,000 in tuition grants [or the
197445 school year.

Nick Ryan, Dean of Admissions
and Student Financial Aid, thought
that the Tuition Aid program‘s
impact would not be strong at
Grinnell, “We do not have so any
Iowa resident students as typical
colleges in the state,"he statedi

Since the assistance program
was approved by the lowa General
Assembly in 1959, Grinnell’s Iowa
students have been faced with a
Tuition Aid program that has not
kept pace with the tuition inflation,
Ryan admiLs that the monetary
outlay necessary to attend Grins
nell, even with the linancial
assistance, is beyond the reach or
many Iowans. “but the program is
very necessary.” Ryan sees a
possible solution in the advent of
“reciprocity among states, so
students can bring their ﬁnancial
aid across state lines.”

During Ray‘s budget recom-
mendation to the Iowa legislature
this year, he pointed out that one
Iowan out of three in an Iowa
private college receives state
assistance. The governor stressed
the need to maintain quality
education at all levels.

In a letter to the Des Moines
Register on» January 24, 1975,
president Richard Turner urged
that the legislature enact the in
crease in state funding of the Iowa
Tuition Program. Turner felt that
the proposed maximum $1,500
grantwould help keep the “healthy
balance between private and
public higher education" from
which Iowa students could Choose,

The Iowa Tuition Grant program
was iirst proposed by Governor
Ray in 1969 and was approved that
year by the lowa Legislature.

Election
rules
proposed

New rules are being formulated
to guide this year’s SGA elections
with the intent of preventing last
year’s election hassles according
to David Berkley, election
chairperson.

A new method of ballot
distribution and collection will be

- employed, Berkley hopes. In order

to receive a ballot this year, a
student will have to present an ID
card to a checker who will then
issue a ballot. Aiter voting, the
ballot will be returned to another
checker who will place the ballot in
the box. This entire voting day
procedure will be supervised by
Berkley, if approved by SGA. The
new system proposed by Berkley
’will eliminate bux stuffing,
Berkley stated.

Leaﬂet distribution and cam-
paign posters placed in the post
office on election day will be
prohibited, Berkley's purpose in
suggesting these rules for the
election is to conform SGA elec-
tions to normal democratic voting
processes used in elections.

Nominations for Student
Government Association President
are being accepted until Monday.
The presidential election will be
Feb. 26, followed by vice
presidential elections March 10.
Vice presidential nominations open
