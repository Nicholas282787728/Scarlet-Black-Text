Intramural sports take

by Sarah Brichford

Intramural sports are entering
the second week nf competition and
all is going well, according to iirst
year IM coordinator Mike Jay Jay
comments on his new position. “If
people enjoy the IM program, then
I’m happy to do it.” .

Everyone knows about IM‘S, but
those who pass them up for more
serious pursuits should know some
benefits associated with playtime,

“It's healthy,” Jay stresses. “It
helps people to socialize by getting
to know people in other dorms as
well as their own. IM'S allow
participation in a ﬂexible athletic
program that doesn't require a lot
of time and it’s fun,” Jay adds that
the IM program serves a lot oi
people for a Small amount oi
money and thus, is an economical
diversion from school work.

Grinnell jumped out to an early
6-0 lead and Wesleyan trailed
throughout, In the second half the
Pioneer offense came up with more
points to maintain the winning
margin ior Grinnell despite late
scores by the Tigers.

“OUR MEN CAME up with the
two extra touchdowns when we
needed them." Coach Edd Bowers
noted. “The 207 lead gave us some
breathing room l was able to put
in a few less experienced players
who performed quite well."

Kevin Oaks, Fred McDougal and
Al See each broughtin a touchdown
for Grinnell. Quarterback Don
Petrich completed seven out of 14

attempted passes for 38 yards.
However, Iowa Wesleyan
dominated the aerial game by
passing for 223 yards. The Pioneers
rushed past the Tigers to gain 153
yards on the ground,

STANDOUTS FOR Grinnell
included Ken D'Earski, Harvey
chues, Charlie Gogel, Al See and
Steve Bolesta, all oi whom played
both offense and defense

Coach Bowers was pleased with
the team's performance:
“Generally speaking, our defense
was good. but we do need to work
on it, Our offense was excellent and
I am pleased with the 20 points
scored." Coach Bowers expressed
a need for improvement on punts
and kick coverage, but added that
the mistakes were typical of early
season games.

so far. There are 16 football, eight
soccer and 12 frisbee teams signed
up to play. Jay states, “The
ultimate Irisbee turnout is not as
good as it should be. Teams aren't
showing because games are
scheduled for evenings It’s also a
new game, but I think if people
played it once, it lthe turnoutl

would be fine.”
Success of the IM program relies

mainly upon the two student
coordinators and the individual
dorm iM chairpersons. This year
Owen Hall and Larry Pistrang
serve as coordinators. They're
responsible ior helping to organize
and take charge of different acV
tivitles as well as hiring and
supervising the oiiicials.

Some complaints have arisen
concerning the rough play in
recent football games Norris [M
chairpersons Jane st Clair and
Ken Greene agree that the football
games have been too rugged “The
reis need to set the right at-
mosphere at the beginning oi the
game.” says Greene. “Hopefully
the refs Will call roughness early in
the game to tone it down a little,"
St. Clair adds. “After all, It is a
game," says Greene, “and to win
at any cost. for a keg, is bad."

ON THE OTHER hand. John
Swearer, Loose lM chairperson.
doesn’t mind the roughness of the
games, Swearer, a junior, says he
has noticed the football games
become more competitive during
his Grinnell career He attributes
the tendency toward rough play to
the absence of women on the
playing fields. Swearer, Greene
and St. Clair agree that more
women should be participating,

Concoordinator Hall admits that
it‘s hard to Control the roughness
without adding some restricting
rules such as a dead ball on kicks
offs. Hall thinks the football games
are not unusually brutal this year
and the level of competition is
about the same as in previous
years.

AN ALL-CAMPUS tennis
tournament boasting 31 entries
started last week and is due to
culminate with a championship
match on October 8, After fall
break, co-ed volleyball and a
racquet ball tournament for men
and women Will begin, Mike Jay
wants to instigate programs for
women, because not many women
are currently participating in lM
sports. Referring to additional and
new programs. Jay adds, “If
someone has an idea and we can
get teams to participate, we'll do
it.”
