THE SCARLET AND BLACK

Roundballers’ Record Drops To 1-6

Since last Iwrite, Grinnell's
Pioneers have fared very
poorly on the basketball
courts. In my last prophecy,
I said Grinnell would win the
Holiday tournament at Colorr
ado and, possibly (just maybe),
win the Conference champion-
ship. I apologize for over esll’
mating the talent of our bas-
ketball team. The Hoopstcrs
have won but onegime in say»
en attempts. They lost both
efforts at the Holiday’l'ournat
ment to finish last and lost a
close one to Cornell in their
Conference opener. They fin»
ally won one against Knoxlast
Friday, but lost again the next
night to Monmouth. Overall,
Grinnen's record is 1-6. The

Pioneers are doing better in
the Conference; they're only
l»2. But then, they've only
played three Conference
games. Grinnell plays next
weekend at Ripon and Law-
rence.

In Grinnell's lone victory, it
looked at times like the Pionr
e -rs were finally beginning to
jell as they led 38*33 at half‘
time and had the Siwash of
Knox on the ropes for most of
the second half. However, with
about five minutes left, the
Pioneers startedplayinggive-
away, and the only reason they
hung on to win was because
Knox also played give-away.
The final score was 68-64,
Grinnell. The Pioneers‘ Rah

Obe’s Boys Return As Aquaiocks
Host Grinnell Relays Saturday

Saturday at l p.m., in the
Grinnell natatorium of tem—
porary structure, the school ’5
Aquajocks will host the Grin'
nell Relays. Scheduled to
compete against Grinnell are
Wayne State of Nebraska,
Aiugustana and Cornell. This
meet has been billed as one of
the best to be held in the pool
in its 45 year history. Augus-
tana and Wayne State are each
champions of their confers
ences, while Cornell placed
third behind Grinnell in the
Midwest Conference Meet.

Last Wednesday, the Redand
Black swamped the Aqua
.Scots from Monmouth in a
meet which at the time of this
prose creation has not been
swum. An individual inside
source has made this predic-
tion and was willing to take
all bets on Monmouth.

Just recently, the swim team
was a recipient ofa couple of
breaks. Jim Carns, All-
American and infamous diver
in the conference meet, re
turned from Israel [0 bolster
the team's moral. It is also
rumored that ,l. Rollie has

broken his nose (again) due to
a natural urge.

The Grinnell team has pro-
bably overcome its toughest
obstacle of the year as it just
finished a two week endurance
test of living in Darby Gym.
Most of the team returned on
january 5 for uvoVarday work-
outs featuring Coach Obe’s
patented simulaters, stimula-
ters, and multilaters. At
nights the team was enter-
tained by the waterfall in the
corner, the Vaporizer, and the
mysterious moaner. Gabby
was crowned HORSE champion
and Mike Daley single-hand-
edly won the capture the flag
game with an enlightening ex
perience.

Hopefully next week I can
report victory for the Grinnell
Guppies. If you can't stand the
suspense until next week, the
meet starts at 1 p.m. The meet
queen will be Colleen some:
body, and the team suits will
be obnoxious.

Sincerely,
Adolf Scalicat-

Burnett led all scorers with25
points. He was followed on his
own team by Greg Bombinski
with 17 and Bruce Bonnewell
and Quinton Phea with ll
apiece.

The next night, Grinnell re-
verted to type and blew the
game. The Pioneers were only
down two at the half, but they
lost by 12, 88-76. Again, they
played giveraway in the second
half, but Monmouth graciously
accepted the game. Burnett
again led all scorers with 28
points. Teammates Bombinski
and Charles Patterson follow-
ed with it) each.

On looking over the smtis-
tics, it becomes apparent that
one of Grinnell’s problems is
fouls. Against Knox, the Pion-
eers hit six more field goals,
but kept Knox close by giving
them 18 free points at the
charity stripe while getting
only it] themselves. Against
Monmouth, the situation was
even worse. The Pioneers got
four more buckets, but literr
ally gve away the game, got
ting outscored at the free
stripe 30710.

It has come to my attention
that some of the players are
upset because 1 daredsay they
had talent and couldgoplaces.
"We’re not that good," they
say. Okay, guys. Have it your
own way. You’re crummy. But
I still say you're at least a
.500 ball club ifyou'llconcen-
trate more on basketball and
less on what is said.

Right now lM’s are in a state

of flux. Craig Gordon has
graduated, and, hence, we are
in the process offindingsome-
one to replace him. Neverthe-
less, lM’s will proceed, with
basketball scheduled to start
Wednesday, January 27. There
will be both an “A" and a
"B” league, but theywill vary
greatly. ”A” league will be
organized On a hallbasis,with
the results counting towards
the Truesdale Trophy. “B"
league will be organized by
interest groups. Any group
can play a team, and any hall
can submit more than one
team, with the other teams
playing in the "B" league.
People can play on both an
"A" team and a "B" team,
but will be discouraged from
doing so.

The rest of the semesterwill
include softball, in which I’d
like to institute a 14 or 16inch
league. Golf, track, ping~pong
and paddle tennis Will be held,
beginning shortly. I will a[’
tempt to revive interest in
wrestling. but indications
