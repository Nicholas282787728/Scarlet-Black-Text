LUTHER

The Luther College Chips reports
the organization oi an environmen»
tally-concerned group on campus
called LEAC(Luther Environmental
Action Committee), LEAC has been
planting trees in Decorah, Iowa
parks and recently has beguninves-
‘tigaﬁon into the possibility of re-
placing the Campus canned pop ma-
chines with bottle machines. The
bottle machines would be placed only
in the student union and women’s
dormitories, however: the men are
“too careless about such things.“

COE
Coe’s Student Senate voted last
week to support “mass violation” of
dormitory rules on the part of stur
dents in order to force a liberalie
zation of dormitory policy, The Stu,
dents want 24-hour visitation privir
leges and are protesting “current
overnight key regulations." Ah Edie
torial urges that "Sex is a part of
campus life" and that the Trustees
should recognize that fact by relin-
quishing the ”in loco parentis” idea.
CAELETON

rorth Carleton students attempting
to obtain student funds for a civil
rights»0riented trip to Mississippi
have been temporarily thwarted by

Carleton student government. The
student government president, who
is opposed to running the group on
the grounds that it would set a dan-
gerous precedent of support tor pol-
itical groups, has suggested instead
that the group apply for the funds
from a meal fast.
LORAS

The Loras College Lorinn reports
that the college Board of Regents on
October 15 Voted “not to change the
policy prohibiting open Visitation in
(Smyth Hall) a coed residence hall at
the present time.” The Board feels
that some of the Women Students’
parents were informed of the rules
barring parietal hours and “pre-
sumably sent their students here
with that in mind,” Francis Friedl,
Loras President, commented that
despite the vote the Regents “are
very open-minded" about the situa-
tion,

CARTHAGE

The Kenosha, Wisconsin police
have reported to the Carthage Arrow
that the presence oipolice with hand-
guns on campus is just "to protect
students, their property, and the
property or the college.” Thehandr
guns, the police say, are because oi
the presence of “outsiders" on the
campus at times, although “it is
immaterial to the officers whether
we carry a gun or not." The police
chief is disappointed, he claims,
because ”the students isolatethem-
selves trom the police"; they should
“talk to the officers” more.

WARTEURG

The Wartburg College Trumpetre-
ports that a three—day fastlast week
raised more than $1000 fortheresir
dents of East Pakistan, which has
been recently atnicted by natural
disasters and a civilwar. Aneditor-
la] in the issue praises “the hearts
ening note in otherwise dismal
times.”

COLORADO
The Women’s Liberation Movement
at Colorado College has protested
the ratio of men to women at ColOr
rado, and challenges “enrollment
policies that make it more difficult
tor women to get a college edu—
cation.” The Movementsupports the
“consciousness raising" of local
women. “Consciousness raising is
achieved by sharing experiences of
oppression and relating them to the
sexist condition of consumerism, the
nuclear tamily, and other institur
tions of our White male supremist
society.”
LAWRENCE

Students at Lawrence have raised
complaints recently about the qual-
ity of the food in their cafeterias,
provided by Downer Food Service,
The poor quality of the Downermeat
was most often cited by‘studentcris
tics, since ”a Lawrentian found a
whole cooked lly in a serving of
Chopped sirloin and it’s not unusual
to find pieces of bone in the ham.”
An editorial in the Lawrentian,hOWr
ever, decries the complaints since
“we wouldn't presume to suggest
that Downer Food Center rates right
up there.

UNIVERSITY or NORTHERN IOWA

UNl’s Faculty Senate last week re—
jected a motion passedbytheAmerr
ican Association of state Colleges
and Universities last year support-
ing a liberalization or rules cone
cerning academic tenure. The an
Faculty Senate asserted its support
of academic tenure, proclaiming, in
the words ol a pm student reporter,
“that academic tenure is the only,
tormal safeguard that academic
treedom has.“

‘Decries Discrimination

(Editors’ Note: Miss Noble reported
to the Trustees during their recent
meeting here no the status of full-
time women incuny members. Sonu
confusion would arise concerning
her position, Miss Noble asked that
we print her own carefully-worded
summary of those remarks and the
recommendations she made.)

I am speaking as a representative
of all the full-time professional
women with faculty rank —- all ten
of us. I should like to present a
few facts about us so that you may
be made aware otourpresent status.

Administrative officials and the
chairman of the faculty havebecome
aware of our situation and have
shown a sympathetic attitude, We
speak with the confidence that cur-
rent,inequities and discriminatory
practices and attitudes can and will
be eliminated, especially when the
sitatuion is fully understood by
everyone.

I shall restrict my factual commen-
tary to the nine fullrtlme Women
faculty on permanent appointment.
They include two librarians with
faculty rank, three members of the
Physical Education Department,two
oi the Spanish Department, and one
each in the Music and Communica-

tions Departments. Total academic
departments represented: 4,

Salary iniormalion provided me by
seven women (whose service at
Grinnell totals 109 years) indicates
that three earn the minimum salary
or their ranks, two earn slightly
above the minimum, and all of the
others are nearer the median than
the maximum salary of their ranks.
it would seem that there has been a
double standard for men and women
with respect to salaries,

It should be pointed out, too, that
promotion may come slowly. Some
examples include promotion from
one rank to another after: a) 15
years b) '7 years (and currently 9
years in the present rank); or
there may be no promotion at all.

in general, women iaculty have re
ceived little encouragement and have
been largely ignored. No woman has
ever been chairman ot the taculty.
For manyyearsnone hasbeen chairr
man or a division, None (with one
exception) has been elected to the

Executive Council, No women have
been departmental chairman for
many years with the exception of
the Women’s Physical Education De-
partment (which no longer exists)
and the Spanish Department, Women
have rarely been placed in positions
o; leadership and responsibility.

Few women have been given Com-
mittee assignments even whenthese
have been requested.

The environment for women
faculty, then, Could hardly be called
tavorable. it is, in fact, very diffir
cult. There is Clear discrimination
in the attitudes at some men faculr
ty. There is almost no opportunity
for women iaculty who are single
or married to men not on the faculr
ty. to enjoy discussion of mutual
concerns and to exchange ideas with
other professional members of the
college community.

The discrimination against women
laculty has its specialironies, For
example, twelve departments, by
their own estimates, have more than
hall women majors (or, in one case,
just half), but there are no lull-time
women laculty in ten or the twelve
departments. It might be asked how,
in all conscience, tliesedepartments
can encourage women students to
major and seek careers in their
fields when these very departments
do not have (and indeed in a cone
siderable number of cases never
have had) lull-time women staff
members

Women students observmgthe very
small number of fullrtime women
tacully and the general environment
surrounding these women surely can

Against Women

iind little inspiration and encourage
mentor hope for success in an acav
demic career at least, with such
shining “nonrexamples” or recognir
tion of achievement.

The situation of women tnculty has
been deteriorating over thc years.
There are fewer women on the
iaculty now than at anytimcin my
memory. The situation cries out ior
correction.

We strongly urge that a firm stand
be taken against discriminatory
practices and attitudes, and that
steps be taken to correct injustices
and inequities, most essentially and
immediately in the area ofsalal‘ies.
To this elld I am subtnitting the folr
lowing recommendations proposed
by the full time women faculty

We recommend that,

l. discrimination against womenin
salary decisions cease and that 53],
dry inequities now existing be coi»
rccted by special .ncrements; (the
suggestion was made that considera
tion be given to payment retroacA
tively of salary lost l -ough discri-
minatory salary decisions)

2. an appropriate and Ctjultable
salary scale tor inculty salaries be
established in which womenarcpnid
on the same scale as men;

3 highly qualified proiessionalwor
men teachers be hired (full—tilne)in
increasing numbers, prelernhly with
PhD, degrees (ind ati’i l‘ank not lower
than that ol Assistant Professor;

4. highly qualilletl women be hired
for administrative positions;

5. women iacully be given more

opportunity for positions or leader
ship and responsibility;

6, a i‘ull»time woman faculty
teacher serve as Consultant to the
Executive Council on matters of
interest to women until such time
as a wolnzin is elected to the Execu»
tive Council;

7. the talents of women [acuity be
utilized lnore fully in such public
performance areas a college-wide
lectures, panel discussions etc.;

ii. :i fullrtiine Woman teacher be
appointed to the committee instruc-
ted to find and interview womencan-
didates for teaching positions, and
who will also participate in inter—
viewing men candidates to ascertain
their ability to work with women on
a basis of equality; (it is llnderr
stood that. other women faculty would
also participate in the interviewing
of women when the candidate's tield
is within their discipline)

9, administrative officials and the
chairman of the faculty meet with
departmental chairmen and appro—
priate taculty committees to issuea
policy statement concerning diSr
crimination against women faculty,
to provide statistical data and other
evidence on areas of discrimination
and inequities, and to decide upon
steps to be taken to rectify the
situation and provide a favorable
environment tor women taculty; and
10. discrimination of all kinds
against women iaculty be active-
ly discouraged with the help and
example of administrative leader,
ship,
