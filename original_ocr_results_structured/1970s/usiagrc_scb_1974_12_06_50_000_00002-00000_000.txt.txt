Turner: ’take

by Kyle Schanb

The ninth president of Grinnell College sat in the
third floor conference am of Nollen House and
smoked a cigar instead of the pipe pictured in the
Middlebury press photo, His dress still
distinguished him as a professor, complete to the
tweeds. He spoke bluntly, without any east coast
sophistry. and often admitted simple ignorance of
current college practices—ratheFthan attempting
glib answers to cover up his imperfect knowledge of
Grinnell, The fault was forgivable; it was only his
second visit to the campus.

After settling down in one of the moulded plastic

chairs, A. Richard Turner expanded on his field of
expertise, art. When asked about the state of art
here at Grinnel], he drew on his cigar and said that
he was impressed with the works of art on display
throughout the College buildings. He does feel the
need for a permanent art gallery, though. When
asked about Schaeffer Gallery, he commented
gruiily, “Oh, that bowling alley."
Not a painter

He looked around at the collection oi art hanging
on the walls of the third floor perch, and admitted
that he is no painter or sculptor. His real creative
genius iies in photgraphy, His eyes lit up when he
confided that one of the most exciting features of the
president's house was the existence of a darkroom,

In a more serious vein, the new president ex-
plained that in his younger days when he had more
free time, he wrote critques on contemporary art.
However, his favorite pcrod oi art is the
Renaissance, and his favorite artist Leonardo
DaVinci. He leaned across the table and intently
talkedabout the importance of art and art history,
which he culminated in a promise to teach such a
course beginning in the fall of 1975.

Turner also discussed his first impressions of
Grinnell. His face took on a stormy appearance
when he chastised both students and faculty for
apologizing ior the location of Crinnell in iowa. He
wants Grinnell to say to the country that this is
where we are, and that Iowa’s posttion as the
nation's breadbasket is far more important today
.than advantages of being on the east coast

Credit

Credit came up as the next topic, and Turner
greeted this thorny problem by concentrating on his
cigar, He seemed a little leery of the basic 4-credit
system, since Middlebury does not offer any credits
but rather requres the completion of 32 courses ior
the iinal degree. He explained that Middlebury
could not equalize the “energy input" of four
cnglish credits to four organic chemistry credits.
and therefore dropped the rating system all
together.

Two-man departments, interdisciplinary majors.
and practicum credit were also discussed, and
Turner was very much at ease with these iaculty
related problems. He said that both Middlebury and

pride in Iowa’

Prcsidentelect A. nichard Turner admits that
financial perations area weak point for him. and is
quite willing to permit Dean Waldo Walker to
continue to handling the budget. Together he feels
that they will make “good partners in crime."

Grinnell have overextended themselves by tying
down majors to specific departments, a restriction
he labeled a “traditional accident,” He foresees
more ﬂexible combinations oi majors under
broader departments to handle the range of
students‘ interests at a liberal arts college. He
paused, and then wenton to say that he is willing to
provide the leadership ifhe has iaculty backing and
proof that the will is there. Practicum credit did not
receive such a liberal treatment, the new president
admitted that in this area he “tends to be con-
servative." He feels that colleges can get into a
“credit syndrome" where any significant input oi
student time is rewarded with practicum credit. He
wants the school to sort out the types of activities
which receive credit and make distinctions from
that list. Turner did admit that practicum credit
deserved a closer examination.
Money

Money inevitably found its way into the interview,
and the art historian provided an interesting insight
to one of the major roles he must play at Grinnelli
that oi iund raiser His face broke into a broad grin
as he revealed “i enjoy relieving people oi hard»
earned bread for higher causes." l-le punctuated
that last remark with a happy cloud of blue smoke,
which seemed to signal the upcoming era of change
for Grinnell.

75-76 facuIty

Career Preview Internships in
law, medicine and publishing were
highly popular among the 127
students lhat applied (or
placements, while competition for
offerings in other fields was almost
nonexistent.

0f the 92 internships offered. 35
had no applications and many
others had only one or two,
Director of Career Services John
Adams said that no further at-
tempt would be made to fill the
empty placements, but that they
might be oifered again during
spring break.

Adams. who along with Alumni
Executive Secretary Dorothy
Palmer, is heading the program,

said that the lack of response to
certain internships wfls disap-
pointing, as well as the total
number oi responses

Tentatively, oz oi the applicants
have placements and all in-
ternships receiving bids have been
filled. Adams said the application
iorm was the only information
used to decide Who would be aces
peted and a lotof weight was put on
the applicant‘s statement of why
heror-she wanted to participate.
Also he added, “we hated to do it,
but we gave seniors priority."

Seniors constituted onerthird of
those receiving placcmcnts despite
providing only one-fifth of the
applications However, juniors
were awarded more internships
than any other class.

The Career Services Office is
now concerned with finding
housing. Adams said the majority
oi students have arranged living
accommodations but locating
residences for others is the office's
biggcst problem. He said it was
especially troublesome in large
cities such as New York and
Chicago where [worthirds of the
students will be working (onerthird
in each city.)

The structure oi the internships
will be decided by the student and

ratio. The 197546 faculty size will
be 99 and threesixths full»time
positions, with a projected student—
faculty ratio of ll.73:l.

The departments which are
losing the equivalent of at least one
iaculty position are English,
music. Spanish, history and
physical education. Two of these
departments, music and physical
education, released the names of
departing staii earlier in the
semester with the resignations of
the Manhatten String Quartet and
Professor Jean King.

Three fourrcredit courses a
