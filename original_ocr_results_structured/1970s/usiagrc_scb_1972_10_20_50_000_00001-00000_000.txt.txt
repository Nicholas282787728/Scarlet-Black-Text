Hughes Lambasts

by Curt Carroll
and Don Dagenais

U, S Senator Harold Hughes apr
peared at Grinnell yesterday, in-
troduced by Democratic Congres—
sional candidate Ed Mezvinsky as a
man “who symbolizes what’s good
in the American political process.”
Greeted by resounding applause
irom the large Grinnell audience
gathered in Herrick chapel. Hughes
stepped forward to presentlhe views
which were the basis for Mez-
vinsky's characterization He ad,
dressed his audience not simply
as a group or constituents,bul spoke
to them as people. This outlook
is central to his approach to work-
ing Within the political structure,
which he believes must “...respond
to us and look to our humanneeds."

Congress is changing priorities in
attempting to respond to people’s
needs, llughes said. “We've added
human programs,.,meeting human
problems in this country." But in
examining the Executive branch oi
government he was more criticaL
“1 don't believe people in America

. have really gotten the message or
what this (Nixon's) Administration
is doing, and the need ior replacr
ing it.“

The State Department, he noted,
has been "moved into the White
House" by Henry Kissinger and his
army of 200 administrative assis-
tants, and President Nixon has“asr
sumed executive authority” in aut—
horizmg continued airstrikes againr
st North Vietnam and in the invas-
ion of Cambodia

The Administration’s law enforce—
ment policy has not been to der
dccrense crime, Hughes said, but
only to slow its rate or increase.
"They call that taking 0 e of the
problem "

"I can‘t imagine the guts of the
man coming out 101' law and order,"
Hughes sairi,”while Londoningburg-
Ial's and thievcs in his own carn-
paign." llughes emphasized the bug—
ging oi the Deinocraiicheadquartei s
at the Watergate lipill'tmenls “That
is not pait oi the politicaignnie in

America,” , he said later in the
morning during an interview in the
sop otiice. “The Committee {or the

Reselection oi the President has a ’

new name: The Committee on Dirty
Tricks for ReAElecting Tricky
Dick."

“I'll tell you why I think President
Nixon should be kept out of ofnce,”
Hughes said. “He has propagandized
the American people more than any
other Administration in the history
at this country." .

Hughes documented this charge i
referring to the indochina War. He
cites the employment of Thai “V01-
unteers” in Laos as an “unbelieVr
able story ofdeception for the Amer
ican people.” He decried the cons
tinual expenditure of the “blood and
resources of the American people...
America has the capacity to cry for

' the dead, even if they are not our

dead."

"I couldn't have believed four years
ago that we would elect a president
— Democrat or Republican - who
would not have ended the war within
a year’s time;..The President has
failed.”

Nixon’s Administration has failed
on domestic issues as well, Hughes
believes. “He has set Ci ’1 rights
back ten years.“ Criticizing huge
outlays ior deiense projects such as
ABM--"the great platinum-plated
slingshot--“tlle Senator believes
that “we can cut our defense budget
...and maintain our deiense pass
ture", rechanneling the revenues to
deal with pressing domestic prob
lems,

ln contrast with Nixon, Hughes
found McGovern “not guilty” of
“deceit and deception...he's guilty of
telling American people they ought
to 'love one another.” Hughes and
MCGvern sit together in the Sour
ate chamber-- “He sits just to the
left of me ” Hughes’ insight into
McGovern's character is that ”what
was originally being called radical
is compassion and meeting ofhuman
needs ” He praises McGovern, be
cause “these things have got to be
cared for;" America needs McGovr
ern "to return home to sanity."

in iocusing on lowa politics, Hughes
lllso lauded Dick Clark, the “gl'eatr

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 20,1972

After lengthy Faculty Meeting...
Election Day Classes Retained

Classes will not be cancelled on
November 7, Election Day, butstur
dents who miss Courses that day
because of election day activities
may arrange with proiessors to
make up the work outside oi class,
the inculty decided at its regular
meeting last Monday afternoon. The
issue arose alter the Joint Board
voted two weeks ago to recommend
a cancellation of classes on Nov
'7 and the Executive Council relayed
the measure to the iaculty, making
no recommendation on the question.

The faculty also approved an acar
demic ' calendar for the 1973-74
school year which contains a nine.
day fall mid-semester recess from
October 20 to October 29, a change
from the present practice, which is
to give only four days for the fall
mid-sem break.

Parliamentary Mishmash

Members of the faculty debated a
plethora of motions and amendments
for one hour and fifteen minutes be-
fore determining that classes would
not be cancelled. Professor of Ec0r
nomics Robert Voertman submitted
the original motion, to (l) cancel
all classes on November 7, and (2)
to establish a regular practice that
classes be cancelled on all election
days hereaiter, Election day has not
been regarded by the society asbe-
ing particularly significant, Voert-
man noted, except that ”the sale of
liquor" is forbidden. Should the
society begin to emphasize the day,
he noted, ”the electoral process
might be somewhat improved.”

nnuieny nan 7. brain
Senator Harold Hughes

'cst candidate i’ve seen in my liie-

time.” in his bid for election to
the 11.3. Senate, Clark has waged
a “real aggressive, outgoing cams
palgn in getting his message to
low people.,.he has a good chance

‘to Win."

Hughes' appearance came under
the auspices oi PPPE, a’program
with a practical approach to which
he prolessed a high regard. “Grills
nell College has always made great
contributions to the political struc4
ture of this state, and l'ni sure the
nation " This was not simply ego
massage, because Hughes felt that
a political education of this nature
gives students a background such
that ”you may well make the this
ierenoe on the critical issues We're
almost totally reliant upon you,..
(for) the real diilicult task oi work
ing

It takes a “spiritual unity," Hughes
concluded, a willingness to “lovc
more than hate,” to surmount the
barriers to human social develop-
ment in this country ..” you've
got but a thread of belief that those
things are righl- -l0l' God's sakelielp

Following a motion by Chemistry
Professor William Oelke, the ques—
tion was divided into two motions,
and the iacnlty proceeded to debate
them simultaneously,

students present at tlicineeting em-
phasized that the primary reasonior
the proposed cancellation of classes
was to allow students to work at
the polls and at the political head—
quarters to assist members of the
community in voting, son president
nuss McGregor and Vice-Press
idents Walter and Pfeffel-Vboth spoke
to the importance of this work, and

SGA President Russ McGregor re—
acted Wednesday to the faculty ac-
tion, by calling tor a class boycott
on election day. Details on page 3.

poll cal organizer Jeri-y Miranr
owski presented the iaculty apetition
signed by 641 students calling forlhe
cancellation of classes.

Such an action, observed Political
Science Professor Edwin Gilmoul‘,
would have “symbolic" value. “The
‘business as usual' approactltopolir
tics has gotten us where we are,”
he said. “It classes are more im-
portant than what happens on elec-
tion day, then perhaps we should
go to class. By continuing to do our
business on election day Wearesayr
ing that politics is not important."

At this point Doll Smith, Associate
Professor of History, observed that
the second motion, to cancel all
Classes on election days in years
hence, demanded no immediate
action and should therefore be re-
legated to the Academic Standing
Committee. This was done

Procedural Flexibility

The debate on the immediate mo,
tion continued. “I don’t think there
is a real relationship between our
political attitudes and Whether or
not we go to classes,” objected
Professor of Biology Guillermo
Mendoza.

Dean 01 Administration Waldo
Walker proposed an amendment to
the measure, which would substi-
tute the Tuesday of midrseinester
break ior Tuesday,Nov 7, therebv
granting the Nov, 7 cancellation
without shortening the number of
class days in the semester The
amendment passed 39720. Coin-
mented president Legged: “This is
known (is procedural flexibility“

other members ottheiaculty, hoWr
ever, were not so sure that Students

would Wish to sacrifice a day of the
mid-semester break. NotedaEnglish
Professor Edward Poster: “The
people who have gone by the estab-
lished procedure are being pe‘n.
alized " ”Theneatnessofthe Dean's
manipulation or days," complained
Associate proiessor oi History
Gegory Guroﬂ, “is an unfortunate
one.”
With that Associate Professor of
Music James Wyly, who ha oied
ior the Walker proposali ally,
called for an action to reconsider
The vote, however, was only 25-
26 and therefore the requisite ma:
yority did not exist,
Calendar Juggle
Philosophy ProfessorJohnWorley
moved at this point to tablethe mea-
sure until next week. A ISrminute
debate on the motion to table ens
sued, wherein Wyly complained that»
the decision was being made late
as it was, and Dean Joseph Wall
quietly observed that such action
would require anexlra faculty meet
ing next week. When the vote was
taken no one-mot even Worley~
voted torlhe motion. 3 ' .
Dean Walker had another idea.’i‘he '
Tuesday oi 'midrsemester break
seemed an unpopular dayio remove,
he said, so the faculty should subs
stitute December 13 of the first
semester buffer period for themidr
semester Tuesday, thereby short»
ening the buffer period rather than
the break.Thisproposalprovedpop-
ular. and So the faculty voted 34-18
to switch the dates, ,
Dean Wall, glancing at the clock,
observed that the faculty had a len—
gthy agenda and might considervotr
ing on the.inotionas amended.'rhere
being no objections, the vote was
(continued on page 7).'
