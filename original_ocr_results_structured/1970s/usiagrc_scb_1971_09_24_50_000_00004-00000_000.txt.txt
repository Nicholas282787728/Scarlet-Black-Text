Lying on the desk one spots a

The office is Steiner Z]. and
the gentleman is Mr. Dennis
Haas, Assistant Professor of
Religious Studies and Chap-
lain at Grinnell. He came here
six years ago from Franklin
Marshall College, anall‘male
school in Pennsylvania where
he had served as College Char
plain and also hisalma mater.
Mr. Haas likes dealing with
the Wider range ofconcerns of
a co—ed campus, a community
more "real"thantheall-male
school he came from.

In his six years at Grinnell,
Mr. Haas has found that stu-
dent interest in religion it~
self has increased , broaden‘
ed and deepened, but involve-
ment in the actual worship
aspect has greatly decreased.
He cited a time when two to
three hundred students would
show up at Herrick on Sunday
mornings, Whereas today one
can expect only about thirty
to fifty. The service, basical-
ly a nonrdenominational Pro-
tesmnt one, has gone from a
highly formal program to a
highly informal one.

While about one or twoyears
ago Mr. Haas saw a risingin-
terest in non-Western reli~
gions among college students,
this year finds a revival of
interest in Western religion,
the surmlled ”Jesus Freaks"
being one example of this
phenomenon.

How does the chaplain» view
"Jesus freaks?" “My only
concern is that many people
are turning within themsel-
ves," he said, "dropping out
of the whole area of social
concerns and political action.

Listening to students' problems is just one part oer.
Dennis Haas' activities as College Chaplain.

Many are concerned only with
personal salvation, or that of
their immediate community.
The original Jesus concerned
himself with suchproblemsas
widespread exploitation and

oppression, and sought world
peace."

In Jesus Mr. Haas noted a
lifestyle attractive to youth.
”radically different from the
'acceptable' lifestyle of the
70's." Jesus was not tied
down by a job, broke offfamir
1y relationships for the most
part, and travelled all over
with a group of people in a
sort of communalsituation, he
pointed out.

Anyone seeking counseling
can come to Mr. Haas. Four
years ago, he and some stu-
dents set up the GrinnellDra—
ft information Center to sup’
plement the counseling he coue
ld offer in that area, the Gene
ter particularly specializing
draft problems other than conr
.scientious objector status,
which Mr. Haas is most qual-
ified to offer advice on.
Students also bring family
problems. religious / ethical
questions, 'and sexual cons
cerns. Mr. Haas is a member

"Music is the healing force
of the universe." (Albert Ay~
ler)

This is the philosophy which
Social Committee member
Dennis Mackler operates
under when consideringmusi-
cal entertainment for Grlnr
nell.

So far, the Social Committee
has scheduled John Littlejohn
and Jimmy Rodgers in the
North Lounge Oct. 2. Accord-
ing tOSocial Committee chair-
man Ed Levine, "They’re for-
gOtten blues musicians who
play standard Chicagoblues."
_ Indian music is beingbrought
in Oct. 9 to Roberts Theatre.
Ali Akhber Kahn, along with
two or three accompanists,
lWAll perform on the "sarod,"
Kahn is recognized as an ex-
pert in his field.

Sugar Cane Harris and Har-
vey Mandel are members of
the newly~formed rock group,
"The Pure Food and Drug
Act" who will play Oct. 23
in Darby Gym. Levine said,
"We were lucky to get them
for a reasonable price. They
have just signed a sinfigured
contract with Columbia." He
added, “1 think this is their
first concert west of the rocr
kies."

Another Darby concert feae
turing Chimgo bluesrnan Bud-
dy Guy and Junior Walls will
be held Nov. 4.

Other tentatively scheduled
talent includes jazz artistRo»
land Kirk, last year's popular
musician Luther Allison and
folk singers Mr. Bojangle, Jim
Kweskirlﬂid Jerry Jeff Wa’lr
ker. V

Levine said, "Colleges like
Grinnell who have a fair 3-
mount of money to spend on
music should support the clas-
sic forms, likes blues and
jazz. They need the support or
they go hungry. The govern-
ment supports orchestras and
other art forms, butnotmusic
which is American in its de-
velopment. I think it’s another
form ofracism bysuppressing
the blues and jazz musicians
who are almost all black."

Eigename talent is hard to
budget, according to Dennis
Mackler. He explained, ”We
could have the Jefferson Air-
planti but we'd blow the bud

get in one day.”
The Committee tries to com-

promise by finding good people
who haven‘t built up a big repu-
tation yet. "We also try to
give people breaks," Mackler
continued. "Usually good
groups in places like Chicago
and St. Louis have a hardtime
getting started but can easily

make the trip to Grinnell."
In addition to rock, blues,

jazz and folk music, the Com-
mittee is attempting to pres
vide new sounds like Brazi-

lian, African and Indian music.
Levine stated: "The role of

the concert committee and
social coordinator shouldn't
only be entertainment. The
music We provide should also
be educational. Kids should
give new forms of music a
chance and learn something
outside of the classroom. Lis-
tening only to rock music is
like only reading Shakespe-
are."

Career ServicesOffer Rhymes, Not More Ulcers

by Toby Wosk

Doctor, lawyer, lndian chief.
By Athe‘r'tim'enyou get to’col‘
lege, deciding on your cho-
sen path can become more of
an ulcer than a nursery rhyme.

Fortunately, Grinnell‘s Ca-
reer Services Office willsoou
be open for business, provi-
ding catreer and jobplacement
information to any studentunr
sure of what he wants to do
after graduation.

Prudence Milite, Director of
Career Services, and Pam
Wrightman, Career Services
Counselor, will be \vorkingal-
ong with Marge Daley, asr
slstant dean ofstudentaffairs,
on the project.

,New Trend

Prudence notes a new trend
away from the routine ofgoing
to graduate school immedia‘
tely after graduation with lit-
tle doubt or hesitation, a prar
ctice common up until two or
three years ago. Today, for
draft reasons, financial rea-
sons, etc., she finds that “peer
ple want to thinkseriouslyabr
out What they're doing with
themselves before committing
themselves to two or three
more years of schooling.”

Prudence and Pam hope to

help people develop anaware-
ness ofcareer directions,ma—
king people aware ,of their
skills and limitations in order
to answer the sometimes
mind - boggling question:
“What can a person with a
liberal arts degree do with it
after he graduates?" Bothwo-
men stressed the importance
of a student developing some
sense of what he wants to do
with himself before senior
year, trying to form some
goals early to avoid last mir
nute decisions.
Special Services

Among the special services
the office hopes to provide
this year include:

: The administration of a
vocational interest inventory
followed by individual confe-
rences with the students ta-
king the test.

- Rap sessions in dorms with
business andprofessionalmeu
and women.

, Seminar groups regarding
procedures for filling out Job
applications and writing re-
sumes that can be interpreted
as something positive. Pru-
dence and Pam will help stur
dents formulate their expe
riences and discover what
skills they have gained that
