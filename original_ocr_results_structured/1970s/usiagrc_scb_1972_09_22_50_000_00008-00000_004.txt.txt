I! the intention was there

To iorce the glacial question

To any witless denoument

Perhaps it was the thin wind

The clutching oi the night's whiteness
Which snatched it away to a higher
Soiter berth, again to paint

The irozen riddle on the lips

or the snuteyed smile

That always waited, on his pillow;

Why he pulled the hands

From the tirm complacency ot breasts
To weave wearily through the room's
Womolike shadows

Again to grope tor the chill

ot the rlnlErglhzed window,

And thrust them
Once assured the certainty ol warni
Dew, the solace ol the tultcd prison
Once bound last in eager closed spaces
Now bathed in the sadness ot steam
And naked under star hreath, out

into the hitter openness at his choice,

Why he slammed the casement down
pinning them in its icy grip

While the fingers hung Ilaccld and tree
Like the necks of freshly dead geese
And the ﬂesh waned paler

Than the moon's fixed grin, then hard
starlight coaxed a trembling

And drew them rigid like slivers

0t iron to the mother lode, why

She with hands at a lreedom

Not his own nor his to know, rose then
Knelt at the trusted sill

To knead the reluctant clay ot dark thighs
Kindling no sighs,

No warm shivering like helore,

Why he only spoke or choice
Yet no choice, oi limos at once
Like sculptors or puppets
shackled willingly by the Light
To this nightly liturgy or snow
Yet tree to never question
What remained tor other
Frozen evenings in the chill
or the rime-glazed window

The red king sings a

scrawny Ieathered song

to incessant tapping

on the grain and sand and white
covering the courtyard as skylight ends.
Tapping birds jerk at grains

searching for the sound of

roosting house and cons and eggs and white light bulb
on the chicken courtyard scratched

ang, dirtrhlaoded claw marks

in the ground's nesti.

At night claws rip across the yard

,yellow, relentless claws until

he dark, beneath a ﬂeshy crew

neck: snapiip to hear . .
a red ieathered strut

cruckliug
crow crow crow

Oi‘ﬁrelight; no winter yet,

mere candleglow-eshadows or you
against my wall, a tlicker rtet
against my wall, a llicker ielt
like organ bass in my inside.

I know you, in your full-stopped sound
sonorilies unreal to me,

yet familiar, as cloud torms are
recognized yet ever ditierent.

You are nne improvtszttion,
variation, culmination,
modualtion into deepest realms
oi vibration innerrachlng.

l the theme, simple melody,
line in my way, and rhythmic,
my part an ostinato to

the splendor ot your cadences.

The music hesitates; the
termata oi our growth bid pause:
we are not tree, as yet, to move
primitively, trusting instinct,

we recapitulate, resolve.
The dissonance transports, transcends
My solo, your virtuoso

phrase, recomoiue into together.

Our resonance new. sott as light,
translucent as the shade oi tlame
is now a tone poem, anight pieve.-
is now a tone poem, a night piece -
magical merger wrought by love.

Bringing it Home

Riding with a car through a cloud scattered day,
l-litching himseli along the U.S.A:
Cornnelds glint, then darken and roll
Concrete and steel smoothly 110w
Talklng or valleys and camping in hills
Each at ease with a stranger, both tired from travel.
Silver (lash oi wings slip from a cloud,
Cumulornimbus shroud scattered land.
Rolling Thunder oi the sweeping jets
Scream hard down the interstate. Death
Heaving earth. Twisted names searing the tields.
Blasts shatter rocks, rip holes in my ears,
Shredding cars as paper heads come apart.
Twitchlng remains across the U,S.A.
Hiding in a car on a bomb shattered day.

When We Die

When we die

when they open our graves

And pick up apart,

They will not see

What held us together

Or one any reasons

To believe

That we ever were held together
By anything more than

Rubber bands or straitiackets.
They wun’t even know

Who we were

Or what time we went to sleep
Or that I never ate breakfast (except once).
It doesn’t pay

To live

A thousand years

No one remembers Marty 1k“
