;Trustees'talk
to students

by Janet Pope

The Board of Trustees held their
first annual meeting when all but
three of them came to Grinnell last
weekend. Though business
meetings were held throughout the
weekend and basic decisions about
next year’s budget were made, the
trustees did spend time talking to
students and touring the residence
halls,

Turner has encouraged the

rlrustees to have more interaction

with students when they come to
campus, “We want to move to a
sition where the trustees get a
general feel for the campus as
’ opposed to learning about it
strictly on an intellectual level,"
explained Turner.
Friday night, Haines Hall held a

‘ formal cocktail party for the

trustees. Bob Tracy. hall Coors
dinator, explained that he had
heard that Norris Hall had given a
party tor the trustees last year. So
on the second day oi classes he put
in a request to hold this year’s
party in Haines. Subsequently, the
hall voted to have the party and to
.make it formal. A committee was
set up which worked with Tom
Ackerman, associate director of
development The president’s
office provided me tor the party.
$40 was collected in donations and
$40 came from hall funds.

“It was really successful,”
commented Bob Tracy. “Several

‘ oi the trustees and administrative

people hung around until the wee
hours of the morning . . . It was a
plus for the trustees, the ad

‘- ministrative people and it was

good for the studentsithey all

loosened up together. "

On Saturday the trustees toured
the residence halls. Many were not
pleased with what they saw.

Some of the trustees attended a
coffee Saturday aiternoon to talk to
students and faculty. Finances, the
function of the board and dorm
renovations seemed to be the main
topics of conversations.

Saturday night Will CollinS,
Kathy Kramer, president and vice
president oi SGA, respectively,
and two SGA members ate dinner
with the trustees and members of
the faculty and administration.

Sunday morning the Committee
on Community Life ate breakfast
with Turner and seven students at
the Black Cultural Center. This
committee was just formed to
assume the duties of the Multi-
Bacial Committee and concern
themselves with the quality of
campus life. According to Rickie
stakes, topics of discussion cenr
tered around the “problems black
students might have encountered
while at Grinnell” and “where
blacks on campus are going as
students.”

The trustees seemed pleased at
their interactions with students.
Turner called this weekend’s
meeting “an excellent one.” He
commented that there was a lot of
“participation," “deliberation,”
and “a tremendous amount of
caring,” “The trustees were really
trying to see what would be fairest
and best for the college," stated
Turner.

The trustees will meet again in
February.

Faculty cuts and
fee raise decided

byJanctPopc

Last Weekend at their first an-
nual meeting the Board of Trustees
made basic decisions about next
year‘s budget. On Sunday, the
Board decided to increase next
year’s comprehensive ice by $250,
which includes a $65 increase in
board, implement a 5 per cent
average salary raise (or faculty
and administrative staff, eliminate
no lower than three regular iaculty
positions and to seek reductions in
the administrative staff. These
deClsions were made in order to
balance next year's budget at a
sum of $3,279,075.

College President A. Richard
Turner explained that the $250
amount represents a 5.4 per cent
increase which is well below the
current inilation rate. Therefore,
he explained. the cost of a Grinnell
education to a student will be less
next year than it is this year. He
also emphasized that the college's
”committment to financial aid
remains absolutely firm and will
take inﬂation into account.”

Turner termed the fee increase
“responsible,” commenting:
“There’s no getting away from the
necessity of some raise without
digging yourseii a deeper hole.”
He Said that the administration
and the trustees do not believe that
Grinnell students can afford the
services which were cut out of next
year's budget. Turner feels that
the balance between holding down
salaries and making some cuts in
the number of faculty members is
better than going all the way in
either direction.

The trustees decided to eliminate
$50,000 ata minimum from faculty
salaries According to a statement

issued to faculty and staff by
Turner, this means the abolition of
“no fewer than three regular
positions beyond those already
determined to be eliminated or
reduced in cost through lower
salaried replacements."

Dean Waldo Walker explained
that the cutting of Land one~third
positions recommended by last
year’s Executive Council will be
included in the cuts decided upon
by the trustees. Dcan Mary
Eysenbach explained that the
decisions about where faculty
members will be eliminated have
not yet been made. She said that
the Executive Council will make
those recommendations to the
presidents

Turner plans to send out letters
to parents informing them of the
fee increase.

Though basic budget decisions
were made this weekend, the
budget will not be finalized until
June. The administration will be
working out the details with final
approval coming from the
trustees.

Although the financial situation
looks bleak for private educational
institutions. Turner commented
that Grinnell is in a relatively good
position. “We are in com-
paratively strong financial shape
compared to most oi our sister
institutions . . . Our investmenﬁ
are hanging on while others are
deteriorating," he said. ”Our in-
vestment portfolio has been very
well handled.” He referred to the
trustees as ”really excellent
people.”

Though plans and goals have not
been finalized the college plans to
launch a special fund-raising

campaign. Turner explained that
such a campaign would he “a real
attempt to raise as much money as
we can . . . a time to really come
on." He said that it would probably
start next fall and be three years in
duration.

in another eitortto gain revenue,
an attempt is being made to in-
crease enrollment to 1250 over the
next couple of years Until a new
Director of Admissions takes over,
which will probably not be until
sometime this spring. Turner
explained that college personnel
are not working on any speciiic
recruitmentplan. However, during
a trip last week Turner visited
various eastern prep schools and

‘ additional Visits are scheduled for

his trip this week. Roger Koester,
coordinator of student records
systems and director of offrcampus
study, Torn Latimer, director oi
recreational facilities and ser-
vices, and Jim Tederman, dean of
student affairs have all done some
recruiting during trips they have
made. An intensive recruitment
ciiort is being made in Iowa Mary
Damsgaard is visiting over 180
Iowa high schools this fall, 30 more
than she did last year.

in the long run Turner com-
mented that there has to be a
change in external financial
conditions if private educational
institutions are to survive Ac-
cording to him. a dramatic turn-
around in the economy would not
be enough. He cited such
possibilities as changes in the
national tax structure, and a
system of national andor state
grants and loans directed towards
students as methods that would aid
private institutions.

Editor’s resignation accepted-

Yearbook hits

by Doug Schultz

Amid financial dilemmas and
staff problems, Marvin Barnes,
editor of the 1974-75 Grinnell Book,
Tuesday resigned his position as
1975-76 yearbook editor. Barnes‘
resignation was inllowed Wed
nesday by that of layout editor Jim
Horrell and assistant layout editor
Keri Underwood.

Applications for editor, assistant
editor and layout editor were being
|aken through today to the Student
Publications and Radio Committee
and appointments will be made on
Saturday.

While the 1974-75 yearbooks Will
arrive in December and be
distrubuted after break, the status
of the ’75-’76 yearbook is under
consideration,

Barnes, Horrell and Underwood
left for similar rcasons. Financial
uncertainties of the book were
making it difficult to'operate and

make a commitment toward,

production. Because of poor
bookoeping in previous years, no
one knew the exact financial status
of this year's book, making it
diiiicult to plan a daily or weekly
budget. Also, since the total
printing bill for the 74-75 books
has not been received and the
books have not been sold, net
revenue from them was uncertain.

Barnes felt his hands were tied
financially irom putting out the
kind of book he wanted to put out;
one which he thought would make
enough proiit to cover the debts of
previous years‘ books.

Also, besides the loss of an
assistant editor earlier this year,
Barnes was facing increasing riits
within the staff and lack of com-
munication.

Harrell and Underwood declined
to assume the coeditorship and

stepped down because. with .the.

productionoi the current bookten

snags

weeks behind schedule because of
numerous problems. they ielt it
was physically impossible to
produce a profitable yearbook.

The main reason for the delay in
last year’s book is that it too was
ten weeks late in starting
production, with a large amount oi
work not being done until late in
the year It was plagued with
financial and staff difficulties also.
Missed deadlines caused both the
staii and the printer to speed up
their work. Barnes asked for proof
sheets from the printer in order to
insure the quality oi the hook.
Major errors delayed things even
more; Barnes worked through the
summer with the book. Dates for
delivery have been moving back
all year They are scheduled to
arrive shortly after break begins,
and will be distributed after
students return. .
