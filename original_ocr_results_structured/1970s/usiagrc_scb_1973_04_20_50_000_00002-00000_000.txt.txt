Faculty Postpones Practicum Vote

by Brent Schondelmeyer

In action at the regularly sane»
duled meeting of the faculty. that
body decided to table consideration
of limiting practicum credit till
the next regularly scheduled meet-
ing by a vote of 28-6-2.

it was the consensus of the group
that due to the limitations of time
and lack of sufficient data and/or
rationale, consideration should be
at some time when both were in
greater abundance.

‘The proposal by the Executive
Council Subcommittee on Educa-
tional Policies recommended that
”no more than 8 practicum credits

should be counted toward the 124
credits required for graduationfrom

Grinnell College.” A previous re-
commendation by the Academic St-
anding Committee had recommended/
that no more than 4 of the credits
could' be in any one department,
but this was not included in Sub—
committee’s recommendation.

Dean Walker made a presentation
on off—campus study. The college
plans to grant ﬁnancial aid for up
to 60 students next year partici-
paling in off-campus programs afr
filiated with the college in some
way. This number would be incr—
eased (0 150 students in the next

Z~3 years and would cost the col»
lege approximately $50,000.

Registrar Charles Seller was na-
med Co-ordinator of Off-Campus
Study and in conjunction with the
Off-Campus Board to he established,
will carry on an ongoing review
of all oft-campus programs.

In other action President Glenn
Leggett announced an executive 5e.
ssion of the faculty for this com-
ing Monday to take care of some
"in»house matters” relating to fa-
culty-Administration and faculty—
Board of Trustees relations.

eral welfare.”

., The Trustees accordingly endor-
sed the principle of formulation of
a set of guidelines for the Board's
Investment Committee by which the

College should exercise its right
through selective voting on proxy
issues of corporations in which
the college holds “substantial sh-
ares.”

The market Value of Grinnell’s
portfolio is currently about $20
million.

'The recommendation was orig-
inally formulated hy students C'urt

Pet Owners

The Pet Board reminds all
pet owners that every dog and
cat on campus must be regis-
tered with the Deans of student
Affairs office and must be wear-
ing a College tag, or the pet’s
owner will be fined and the pet

. may be removed to Dr. Beaver's
office.

Trustee John Price, who is an in-
vestment banker, was designated
to work with the four students and
College Treasurer Robert Anderson
in drawing up the set of guidelines
for proxy voting.‘ The guidelines,
according to Gorrell, will probably
not be put into practice until next
fall.

' College Security

In an open meeting with student
government leaders and about twe
enty other students on Saturday ate
ternoon, the Trustees heard Several
students address the problem of re
cent thefts on campus and proposals
for increasing security procedures
at the college.

The presentations were from sevA
erai points of view, however, and
substantial disagreement existed a-
mong the students present over the
extent of security measures the Col-
lege should consider.

Although members 0! the Board
made few comments concerning the
problem during the meeting with
students, they did discuss the issue
later among themselves, according
to President Leggett. “They sugges»
ted to me that a student patrol
he experimented with," Leggett

said. Deans Conney Kimbo and‘Ji‘rr‘i~
Tederman are presently working‘

with SGA officials to set up Such
a patrol on an experimental basis.

Budget Increase

in other action, the Trustees ap-
proved a budget for the next ac»
ademic year of $6,750,000, an in-
crease of $37,000 over the operat—
ing budget for the present year.

Several Trustees discussed the
current athletic situation at Grinr
nell with student athletes and the
College’s coaches. The sessions,
however, were information-gather-
ing efforts only. and no specific
action was taken.

Action on proposed changes in the
by-laws of the Trustees was de-
layed until the June meeting.accor-
ding to Leggett. Most of the chan-
ges involve minor wording revis-
ions.

The Board also took no action
on the ISPIRG fund collection prOr
cedures for the college, leaving
the collection process in its cur-
rent state. The "positive check
off system” now in effect, therer
fore, will also be in operation next
fall.

Mrs. Ben I). Floyd, Jr., of Tulsa,
Oklahoma, was elected as a new
member of the Board of Trustees,
for a threeeyear term. Ms. Floyd,

Black Educators Contribute To College

(Ed. note: The following biographies are
held over from the Black Students Supple-
ment of our April 6 issue.)

PETER BODUNRIN

by Connie Tuck
When conversing with Mr. Peter Bod—
unrin of Nigeria, one does not discover
the steroetyped stuffy Classics professor.
Instead one discovers an extremely person-
able and ‘articulate scholar who is very
proud of his African heritage. Born in
Osi Ekiti, Nigeria, Mr. Bodunrin has been
teaching in the United States since 1967.
His teaching career however, began at
age seventeen,.when he received his ele—
mentary school teaching certificate from
St. Leo’s Teacher Training College in
Abeokuta, Nigeria. Mr. Bodunrin thenwent
on to receive his General Certificate of
Education in both the advanced and ordin-
ary levels from the University of London.
He was awarded his B.A. Honors in Clas—
sics at the University of lbadan, Nigeria
in 1965. Then, in 1971, Mr. Bodunrin re
ceived his Ph. D. in Classics at the Uni~
versity of Minnesota.
As to whether or not he likes it here
in Grinnell, professor Eodunrin explained,
“One does not like a situation as a child
likes biscuits and sweets, lam not looking
for a situation that is all good or ten»
sion free. Rather I am interested in a
situation that is Worthwhile and challen-
ging. As to the former, one can only
judge post facto. Perhaps over the sum-
mer, I will have the time to look back
and reflect on my first year of the Grin-
nell experience. As to the latter, there
is no doubt that Grinnell is different and
that it is challenging."
Speaking about his profession Mr. Bodun-
rin said, “You know in my profession one
does not always give overt expression to
one’s feelings. We instructors are very
polite to each other," he said smiling.
“But,” he stressed on a more serious
note, “I am not naive in terms of the
hiring of black faculty. i know that the
decision to hire blacks was not a unan-

imous one. However, I have seen no overt
expression of prejudice‘ and I have no
serious reason for complaint,” he added.
In the immediate future, professor Boe
dunrin has worked out a rather impressive
schedule for himself. This summer he will
be taking his Post-doctoral Associate ape
pointment at the university oi Minnesota.
There he will be studying the philosophy
of the social siciences with special refer
ence to a philosophical evaluation of social
science works on Africa. In Grinnell, both
professor Eodunrin and professor okumu,
political science department, are editing
a book defining or redefining and discuss-
ing the concept of political stability in the
African context. Mr. Eodunrin will write
a chapter entitled “ideology and Society”
along with essays from other scholars.

While discussing his life in the United
States Mr. Bodunrin stressed, “I do want
to go back home. However, i do not believe
that it is a bad thing for people in a de-
veloping country to live in a foreign coun-
try if they are not urgently needed athome.
In my case, there are not many Classics
vacancies in Nigeria. The philosophy va-
cancies call for more experience and more
publications. Besides, I feel that by being
in America I have done much more to pro—
mote understanding between Americans (bl-
ack and white) and Africans than I could
ever have done had I remained In Africa.”

Speaking on the popular idea of blacks
returning to Africa, Mr. Bodunrin explained,
“Some blacks came to Africa with white
ideas about helping the ignorant Africans.
We resented this, and I believe it accounts
for some of the bad experiences thatblacks
may have had in parts of Africa." Mr.
Bodunrin also cited the idea of cultural sh-
ock as a problem which confronts many
people when they travel from one country
to another. “Blacks must realize that
there is a difference between the two
cultures of Africa and America,“ the
Nigerian professor stressed. However he
added that aside from these two factors he
saw no reason why blacks could not travel
to Africa and enjoy themselves if they
choose. ‘

Mr. Eoduhrln shares his family life with

his wife Veronica, who is ajunior economics
major here in Grinnell, his son Peter
Oluwole Adetokunbo, his daughter Esther-
Mary Olufunke, and his son onierieme Ade-

davo.

ARNA BONTEMPS

by Michael Harris 5: Edward McCInurin

When asked how he felt about coming to
Grinnell, Mr. Bontemps replied that, “he
had known Grinnell by reputation and that
he had heard a lot about our Alma Mater
from other Grinneilians." Mr. Bontemps
finds Grinnell a new type of experience
and enjoys working with our staff and stuv
dents. Upon hearing this we automatically
asked, “What were his dislikes about our
own fair College Community?” To our a»
mazement Mr. Eontemps feels that Grin»
nell’s one of the most enjoyable places to
work.

Listening to Mr. Bontemps rap is truly
an enlightening experience. He projects
the image of a true intellectual. He shows
the vicissitudes in character, and the qual-
ities that we would like to see in allot
the Professors on campus. We feel that a
man like Mr. Eontemps is needed on cam-
pus, and that it would be a definite mistake
for the administration to let such a man
leave its staff.

We asked a few students how they felt
about Mr. Eontemps leaving at the end of
the semester, Miss Careda Rolland re-
sponded by saying, “I would hate to see such
a thing happen.” Miss Rolland went onto
say, “Mr. Eontemps would be an asset to
the Black Studies department and also to
the History department. Miss Arelen Colven
is of the same opinion but she adds, ”Mr.
Bontemps is the most responsiveprofessor
I have come into contact with." Miss Sy-
hille Scott, Mr. McClaurin and myself
feel that Mr. Bontemps has been the most
thought provoking professor that we’ve
had. There is no doubt that this man has
won over his students. Mr. Bontemps,when
asked how he felt about the students of
Grinnell said he “enjoys teaching such
students as ours because they are eager

to learn, but he feels that college students
in general don’t challenge what is being
presented." Mr. Bontemps further ex-
plained that he feels this is because 5m,
dents sometimes lack preparation ofa valid
argument.

CLARENCE HUGHES

Coming to us from Kansas City, MISSr
ouri is Mr. Clarence E. Hughes, a recent
addition to the Education Department at
Grinnell College. This pastyear Mr. Hughes

Educational Thought, Education Psycho-
logy, and the Analysis of Educational Con—
cepts. He is a member of the committee
on Teacher Education.

Mr. C. Hughes earned his B.A. from the
University of the Phillippines as a History
major, and then went on to earn his MA
from the University of Missouri at Kansas
City in the field of Education.

Before coming to Grinnell College, Mr.
Hughes was a teacher in the Kansas city,
Mo, school system at Westport High Sche
001. He is the father of two daughters; Ma-
rla c. Hughes - 7 years old and Cynthia
L. Hughes - 5 years old.
