Revolutionary academic Davis visits “

by Trcnn t‘leland

Angela Davis. ‘34. an avowed
“black Communist revolutionary"
whose International fame grew out
of the prison turmoil oi the early
seventies. will speak in Darby
Gymnasium tomorrow night at 9
pm.

Davis now lives in Oakland.
California and teaches iii course In
_ieminism at San Francisco State
College She is currently working
on 21 book on racism and sexism

Her lecture, cosponsored by
Concerned Black Students and the
college's Program tor Practical
Political Education tF.P P,E.l at
a cost of $2,500. is [he featured
event of Black Martyrs Weekend.
The lecture has been publicized by
CBS as “an opportunity to hear one
of the major leadeis in the black
struggle ” ,

DAVIS‘S eminence sprang irom
her involvement in 1970 with three
black Convicts at the Soledad
Prison in Soledad, California The
most prominent ot the three was
their selﬁproclaimed spokesman.
George Jackson, who had been
imprisoned tor robbery since 1961
and who, \\ith fellow inmate W L.
Nolen, organized a Marxist
Fanonlst revolutionary collective
among the prisoners

In January. 1970 olen and two
other inmates were s at by a tower
guard while engaging in a iistiight.
The iolloiving day, aiter the local
district attorney dismissed the
murders as “justifiable
homicide,” a white guard was
killed in the prison. Jackson and
two other prisoners, subsequently

 

named the "Solede Brothers,"
were indicted for the murder Soon
thereafter

l).\\'lS, whose communist
idcoiogy had recently gotten her
tired irom her philosophy
professorship at UCLA amidst
much controversy and publicity,
devoted herself to the defense of
the Soledad Brothers, Although she
had only met Jackson once,
briefly. she exchanged an intimate
and clandestine correspondence
with him before he was killed on
August 21, 1970. by- a prison guard

witnesses. vlcrc killed, as w the
iudgc. llaroid itaicy Because tiie
guns were registered to her, Davis
immediately went into hiding and
was soon placed on the FBI's “Ten
Most Wanted Fugitives" list.
Authorities caught tip wtth her in
New York in October. After a iti-
month imprisonment, during
which an International "Free
Angela Davis" campaign took
place, she was acquitted on all

counts. ‘

Davis was born oi middlerclass
parents in Birmingham, Alabama.
and went to high school in New
York and college at Brandeis
University twhere she majored in
French Literature and spent her
junior year at :iie Sorbonnel.
Displays oi racism and violence in
herchiidhood and later discussions
with ieilow students contributed to

Union Steward Doyle hlikles
suggests that the inclusion of an
automatic costrofrltving pay raise
mechanism may turn out to be the
most important of the workers‘
demands. "It tthc cost of livingt .
seems to be the thing that atwa -s

current medical plan and pension
program The current medical
insurance plan is a Blue CrossBlue
Shield program that includes a

claim their pension plan compares
