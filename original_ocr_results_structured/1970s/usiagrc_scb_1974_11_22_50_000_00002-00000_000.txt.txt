Iowa in focus

by John M. Wylie ll
News Director, KDlC-FM

PHOENIX, ARIZ.7
Representatives of five Iowa
chapters of the Society of
Professional Journalists, Sigma
Delta Chi (SPJ,SDX) joined
almost 1,000 representatives from
chapters across the nation here
last week to discuss the present
and future of the communications
art.

That discussion inevitably led to
a discussion of world’s and the
nation’s iuture, The picture that
emerged after three days of
meetings was not a pretty one.

Beginning with noted British
economist Barbara Ward (Lady
Jackson), the convention delegates
haeard a stream of speakers
discussing the desperate world
economic and food situation,

There Were few answers offered
Rather, the speakers urged the
assembled journalists to do a
better job in helping the public at
large understand the complex
situation.

Reg Murphy, the Atlanta Con-
stitution editor who rocketed to
national prominence after he was
kidnapped last winter. echoed
those sentiments when he
described the tour major areas
that journalists must Cover in the
next 25 years.

Murphy called the problems of
violence, starvation. pollution and
the declining world economic
situation the most critical issues
journalists will have to face.

Journalists haven‘t been doing
an adequate job in any oi those

areas, he added.
In tact, panelist atter panelist
companied that, although some
journalists are doing an out-
standing job, many are tailing to
communicate with their readers
and listeners. They iocuscd on two
basic roles lor the reporter:
educating the public about the
problems facing today’s world
while keeping a constant watch on
public and private agencies.

Personal ethics for Journalists
also provided a lively topic lor
debate. Nicholas van Hoffman of
the Washington Post pleaded for
practicality in dealing with
potential conflicts ol interest.

Disagreeing with a number oi
earlier speakers, the controversial
columnist said that simple
disclosure of a reporter‘s outside
activities and involvements would
usually suffice, He said that, if
there was a clear Conﬂict in a
certain area, the reporter
columnist should simply avoid
writing in that area.

Referring to a nationally
televised press conlerence by
President Gerald Ford at a special
Thursday evening session of die
convention, Von nollman raged,
“Jerry Splinterhead was here last
night, and the only thing worse
than the answers were the
questions.”

BITS AND PIECESmDuring the
Phoenix session, the Society’s
highest award, the Wells Key,
was presented to William (Bill)
Kong, assistant city editor oi thc
Dos Moincs Tribune

He is retiring as a regional
director for the Society in a six
state area and was cited [or his
outstanding service to the society.

Kong has been a frequent visitor
to Grinnell and a major factor in
the continued growth and
prosperity of the Grinnell Campus
Chapter, SPJ,SDX.

ureat journalists olten start at
the botom. Dan Rather. a banquet
speaker in Phoenix, attended Sam
Houston State Teachers College on
a conditional football scholarships
”It consisted of a one-way
Greyhound bus ticket and a
tryout," he recalled during dinner.

He didn't make the out To help
make ends meet, Rather took a job
at a local radio station owned by
one Pastor Lott.

He worked alone from 6 arm to
midnight both Saturday and
Sunday. So he could eat, the kindly
pastor had his brother record a
hall-hour program ol music and
inspiration each week, giving
Rather just enough time to race to
the local Dairy Queen and race
back.

But the very lirst week, Rather
had a big problem. While he was
eating (with the radio turned off)
the record stuck during the serr
man.

And for 20-minutes, the airwaves
of Texas resounded with the
preacher’s voice repeating
over andover .. “Go to hell .. Go
tohell,..Gotohell..,” -

Rather said he would have lost
his jobibui pastor Lott Couldn't
find anyone to replace him,

Hansen, Henchmen refurbish
Cowles in clashing colors

“What we did was fairly Con-

structive. It certainly wasn't
vandalism,” commented John
Hansen, referring to the paint loll
given Cowles lounge early last
Sunday morning. Around midnight
eight people met at Cowles and
with paintbrushes in hand
proceeded lo decorate the lounge in
green, blue, pink and yellow hues.

Hansen siad the group painted
Cowles to try and livcn things up
“We were sitting around on night,"
he explained, “and we decided
something ought to be done to
brighten up the campus. lt seemed
like it had gotten to be a pretty
dreary place,” Various ideas on
ways to alter this situation were
considered. “After a good deal of
discussion, we came up with the

idea oipaintlng Cowles lounge,“ he
continued. The project was not an
official SGA project, explained
Lynne Nuber The idea just hap-
pened to come up during a Cabinet
meeting

Donations'were obtained from
various sources. Money came from
the All Campus Party Fund,
professors, administrators and
students

However, Hansen stated that lhe
feedback he has received, from
both administrators and students,
has bccn generally positive.
Reactions of the residents of
Cowles were generally lavoralile.
Others on North commented that it
is good for a change or that they
liked the idea, but not the colors.
Others said more creativity Could

‘Smile’ rider trots
through Grinnell

To paraphase a musty rhyme,
neither rain nor cold nor gloom or
news will stave the pony rider lrom
his optimistic Views. The 1974
counterpart to the pony ex-
pressman, Noah Williiord, stopped
into the Pub Wednesday night to
wet his whistle before pushing on
with his good news mission.
Finally led up with all the bad
news in Newsweek, Williiord is
riding some 1,300 miles from his
hometown Omaha. to Washington,
D.C. There he will ask President
Ford to proclaim Dec. 26 through
the 31 as Goodnewsweek. In New

York he will ask the editors cl
Newsweek to publish a Good
Newsweek between Christmas and
New Years.

Trailcd by his publicity corps
from Civil Bend Farm, Percival
lowa, Williiord and his Appaloosa
mount Easy Rider just want to
make America smile and also
bring America's Bicentennial into
brighter limelight.

Williiord doesn‘t blame
Newsweek lor all the bad news.
”There is nothing to lose but bad

news and that would be good
news."
