IN GRINNELL, Walker reiused
to comment on his candidacy
beyond saying, “I am a serious

Long Blackouts:
No More?

Preventive maintenance work due
ring spring break may prevent the
closing oi academic buildings ior
extended periods during power
iailures on campus.

Dale Hawn, physical plant direc-
tor, said above-ground electrical
switching equipment installed north
oi Burling Library will allow Burli»
ng, the Fine Arts Center. Goodnow
and Steiner Halls, and Herrick
Chapel to have an alternate source
oi power ii their primary power line
iails.

A recent primary power line
iailure blacked out Burling and the
FAC ior more than two days,
iorcing the closing oi both buildings.

With the new equipment, Hawn
said a similar iailure would leave the
buildings blacked out ior only one or
two hours.

The switching equipment allow the
SteinerGoodnowIierrick iacilities,
which run oii oi one transiormer,
and the Burling-FAC buildings,
which run oii a separate transform-
er to operate at a reduced level
using each other's translormers.

Hawn said cost iigures ior the
installation are not available at this
time, but that the cost would be "not
too high, relatively speaking."

He added that the work would help
avoid disruptions oi Grinnell's aca-
demic program caused by mechani-
cal iailures.

CALENDAR

 

Students Flood CalendurOpen Forum

by Dee Dee Goldie

At an open iorum meeting held
Tuesday night to solicit student
opinion on the proposed 1974-75
calendar, Dean Waldo Walker an-
nounced that he would recommend
to the Iaculty a return to the tour-
week break at previous years.

Much was said in opposition to the
calendar. Many students stated that

although the longer break seemed
to be necessary this year, they wo—
uld not like to see It become part
oi the calendar ior next year. it
was argued that the break was de
trimental to the winter sports pros
gram, that it was almost impossir
bie to find jobs In January and that
the break was boring ior students
at home with nothing to do,

ters.

ment in hiring, iiring. and evalua-
tion oi personnel. Nor has.

Dean Walker said that the main
reason {or the six week break this
year was that the energy situation
appeared in be much more serious
than it was. He added that although
the college used thirty-eight per-
cent less iuel over break than they
would in a normal year, the costs
oi keeping the college open during
spring eliminated any savings. He
believed that if theenergy situaton
was as miId next year as it was
this year, there was no reason
{or a six week break.

Two main arguments were made
in favor of a Six Week break.
Phillip Kintner, professor of His:
tory, felt that a six week break
gave proiessors adequate time to
prepare ior their courses. He st-
ated that he could never get ready
to teach second semester courses
without a six week break between
semesters.

This met with much opposition
irom students at the open torum.
There was a ieeling among many
that proiessors had had enough tie
me to prepare to teach in previr
ous years,

The questioni of an interim pro-
gram during break was brought up.
Ii the energy problem lessened, it
was suggested that an on campus ,
interim could be developed, thus
giving students something to do wh—
ile protessors prepared for second

- semester However,agoodprogram
would take quite a While to develop
and would not be feasible tor the
year 197445, said H. wayne MDA
yer, member or the Academic St-
anding Committee.

Sally Snapp, a student at the open
iorum, expressed the ieelings oi
many at the people there when she
said she didn’t want to undergo
a six week break tor a lew years
in anticipation oi an interim pro-
gram being developed. Other stirs
dents iell that the additional cost
of a four credit interim would put
tuition above the budgets oi many
students.

The final decision on the calendar
will be made at the faculty meeting
on Monday, April 15th.
