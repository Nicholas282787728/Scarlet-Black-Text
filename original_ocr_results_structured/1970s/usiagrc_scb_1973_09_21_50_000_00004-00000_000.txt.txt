x All Power To The

Unsung Heroes

Grinnell's committee structure now has its members, and should
e ready to settle down for along year’s work.

Knowledgeable observers of the governmental process at Grinneii
ote that most of the really important decisions are made at the
ommittee level. The committees cover virtually every area of
life at Grinnell, and their smooth functioning isvital to the success
Ir failure of a given year.

A glance at the newly appointed student members reveals a well
balanced group. There are those with recent SGA ties, those with
considerable previous committee experience, those with public
interest experience, and those who are new to the campus.

Together, they form a good cross section of the Grinnell comm-
unity. If they can function together, and work effectively with the
faculty and administration members of their groups, the results
could be very satisfying,

Name a major issue at Grinneil and there is a committee which
deals with it. For example'

* Health SerVices at Grinnell has been a major item on the SGA
,agenda oi issues to be examined, That task should rightly go to the

newly formed Health Services SubrCOmmittee of the Student Ser-
vices committee.

" .A. study last year showed that Burling Library had serious
deficiencies in some areas. This will bea major problem confront-
ing the Library Committee this year.

‘* KDIC's financial woes are a majorconcern of the entire campus,
and will be one of the first items on the agenda of the Committee
on Student Publications and Radio.

* Complaints about ’the [odd have a history as old as Grinneli
College itself. But they, too have a home »- the Facilities and Food
Service SubrCommittee oi the Student Services Committee.

We could continue with perhaps dozens of other examples, but
we think the point has been made. Although many people dismiss
the committee structure as so much bureaucratic red tape, it is
actually one of the most important remnants of the student power
movement which brought it to its present form.

Although the committees are often blamed for their failures,
we fear there may be another problem -- lack of student interest.
How many students could even namethe committeesand their areas
of concern »- let along the student members? Very few, we are
afraid.

Yet, lhe key to committee success is student input. We hope
every member of the campus community will take note of their
representatives on the various committees which are printed else,
where in this issue. The names may not be needed today, or this
week, or even this semester. But they should be tucked away
in some convenient corner or a bulletin board for future refer—
ence. And when someone has a complaint that just can’t wait,
or that one in a million idea that will solve a dozen problems at
once, the people to contact will be waiting within easy reach.

Committee members are doomed to be the forgotten, unsung
members of the Grinnell power structure. But they can be heros
in their own way, if they use the power they have Wisely and con.
structlvely.

A great boost towards Wise, constructive committee action is
consistent constitutent input

Together, it could mean a new beginning for Grinnell government

Ouint Day With Migrant Workers.

To the Editors:

7.45 AM. Saturday

I woke up. it was amazing. i woke
up, and it was cold, real cold .
and it was only early September.
That day a group of people in,
cluding myself went to visit the
Migrant Ministry in Muscatine, lam
wa, We went to find out a little
bit more ol‘ the life and ways of
migrant tarmworkers.

It was a two hour trip from Grin-

Rusk Thanks Students

To the Editors:

May I take this means of thanking
the students who were so gracious
to the “old grads” as we invaded
your chow lines, etc, over the
past weekend? You were all so
tolerant and so helpful as we ask-
ed the same old questions and re-
galed you with the same old tales
of “the good old days." We were
there in the interests of making
sure there will he a Grinnell for
you to come to in 2001 by which
time you, too, will know that the
quality of your life was enriched
by your years in Grinnell and your
associations with people, places and
even things. there. For all old
Grinnellians I say “thank you.”

Sincerely,
Gwen Thomas Rusk ('31)

To the Editors:

Jack Doppelt’s letter last week
roused in me all my latent revoie
utlonai‘y urges, As you do notice
Mr. Doppelt's column appears in
this week's Siis despite it's rather
dubious quality i admit that this
not only is a great victory for me
as well as all other columnists.
i can especially see greater lati-
tude given by the fact that three
weeks earlier Mr. Wylie expurgatr
ed a sentence from one of my cols
‘umns because i used the word
“tail”~as in to kiss. Now because
of Mr. Doppelt precedent i no long
er have to restrict my writing oi
the words SMT and FM to rest
room walls. But this is not truly
the precedent that interests me.
Mr. Doppelt made great demands
and received an exorbitant amount
oi (censored) kissing, now i have,
l think more valid demands and
do here present them

Firstly, l have a question about
the “Bread and Beans and Things”
logo, What i want to know why
all the other columnists have very
characterized and distinct lettering
for their logoes; but mine is very
plain, except for one thing IT’S
wnlrlau IT'S WHITE, DAMMIT!
Why am I the only columnist stuck
with a white logo. What are these
people trying to tell me? i demand
an immediate explanaiinnl

hell along superhighway For us it
was an easy trip. However, the
road these'migrants follow is long,
hard, and tiring. Most of the Chi-
canos have come to Muscatine from
the Texas valley » from Mission,
Texas and other such ghost towns.
For them it is a trip from one
hell to another, from poverty to
poverty. Modern day nomads, these
people suffer. the hate and perse-
cution of a white culture.

Once in Muscatine, we had the
opportunity to speak with lren'e
Munoz, director of the migrant he-

alth center. She confirmed all my
previous iears..,policc oppression,

pesticide related diseases, poor
working conditions, decrepid hou-
sing and sanitary conditions, prejue
dice, and discrimination , today.
But this is nothing new because
migrants have been going to Muse
catine tor 20 years now, picking
tomatoes, cucumbers, and otherve-
getables that ripen during the sume
mer. Every year they come to work
. they have to.

Spending a low weeks here, a few
weeks there, these migrants don’t
have either the time nor the money
to permit their children to enroll
in school. They don’t have time
to be treated properly by physir
cians, They don’t have time to
Settle down. There is no time for
these people,

That same Saturday afternoon it
began to rain. The weather was
still very cold. Our group left Mum
scatine, We were lucky.

Bloomﬁeld Detines Soc. Coordinator Role

To the Editors:

Concerned about the {rightfully Iast
degeneration at this Student Body’s
newspaper, I decided to hit the came
pus community with this enlightenv
ing article. First of all, I am the
Social Coordinator. (The only cor
rect bit of news John Turnbull
gave.) Secondly, being the Social
Coordinator is an emotional outr
burst. What I did say at the Joint
Boards meeting was not an emor
tional outburst since i say the same
thing every week.

Let me explain the purpose of the
Social Coordinator's Report. it is
simply time designated during each
Joint Boards’ meeting for the Stu-
dent Body to question the policies
of the Social Coordinator. NO. I
will not waste my time telling you
what bands will be where and when.
I think our calendar does that quite

well. It is also a time for sugges-
tions since the Social Committee
has to function as close to the Stu-
dent Body as possible With the help
OI my Social Committee - Bill Jollie
(Major Concerts). Cheryl Cole (No-
rth Lounge), Grace Cameron (Coffee
House), Denise Iverson (South Lo,
unge), Brian Mann (Films Chairr
man), Rick Faust and Frank Good,
man (Assistant Concerts Chairmen).
I intend to give you the best year
oi social and cultural events that
you've had in a long time. As long
as people continue to accost me
on my way to classes, downtown
in the stores and in the bathroom
when I'm desperately in need of a
good leak, then we’ll get the job
done. In other Blacker words -
DEAL WITH IT OR LEAVE IT
ALONE,
Celeste Bloomfield
