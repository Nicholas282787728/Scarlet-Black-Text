Seven
students

arrested

For the past week, the entire
campus has been talking about the
arrests of seven college students
who have been charged with
delivery of a controlled substance.
Friday afternoon, Grinnell police
officers arrived on campus and
arrested Mark Bailey and a 17-
year—old freshman. The next
morning, five others, having been
informed that the police also had
warrants for their arrests,
surrendered at the police station
downtown. Cliff Clusln, Ed Gates,
Jeff Marshall. Kai Marten, Doug
Spitz, Bailey and the 17-year-old
were arraigned Saturday morning.

The seven students are accused
of selling marijuana, LSD and
amphetamines, according to police
officers. Evidence against the
students was obtained by the use of
undercover agents.

Each one of the seven arrested
has been in contact with lawyers
this week, Six of those charged
would make no comments about
the arrests. However, several of
them mentioned that they ape
preciated attempts to raise money
in their behalf and that any money
from SGA would be Welcomed.

Donald Schilu. county attorney,
explained that in Iowa there is a
mandatory prison sentence for
delivery of a controlled substance.
He explained that the students may
choose to request a preliminary
hearing. After they have stated
their preference, Schild has 30
days to file a county‘s information,
which is a document stating the
facts of the case, to take the arrests
to the grand jury and obtain an
indictment, or to dismiss the
charges. Schild pointed out that
there is very little difference
between the first two actions. Both
procedures are preliminary steps
to a jury trial.

Both Schild and Darel Lamb,
detective sergeant at the Grinnell
Police Department, explained that
the arrests were made as part of a
continuing attempt to control drug
use and sales in Poweshiek County.
Lamb commented that there is a
definite drug problem in the
county. He explained that the
police department and the sheriff’s
office are making a “concentrated
‘effort all the time “to curtail the
situation. However, he commented
that “we’re just getting our toe in
the door.” Schild stated that there
will be more arrests in Poweshiek
county in the near future. But he
refused to say whether college
students would be involved.

Schild commented, “It would
be more correct to say that drugs
are coming onto the college from
this community and from other
Midwest communities than it
would be to say that Grinnell
Collcge is supplying drugs to
Poweshiek County as a whole."

Throughout the week, the college
has made it clear that, at this time,
they will take no action in cons
llection with the arrests,

Defense
sparks

funding

Since the arrests of seven
students charged with selling
drugs last weekend, various at-
tempts have been made to raise
money to finance their defense.
Proposals for donations of SGA
money were discussed at the Joint
Boards meeting Wednesday night,
a Mutual Defense Fund has been
organized and a benefit was held at
the Pub Tuesday night.

Wednesday night, at the Joint
Boards meeting the proposal was
discussed for close to an hour and a
half. Deans Walker and Tederman
were both present and took part in
the discussion.

When hall representatives
reported about sentiment in their
halls it was clear that a
representative sample of the
student body had not been polled.
Generally, votes that were
reported were split along North
South lines. North was generally
opposed to donation of SGA money
while,overall,South was in favor of
such action

Walker and Tederman both
questioned the legality of an SGA
donation. Walker along With
several members of Joint Boards,
suggested that money be donated
privately by students who wished
to do so. In this way, they exs
plained, money could be raised
without worry about
problems.

Boards approve a resolution that
he had drawn up. The motion Was

it was Nissen’s decision to hold
the benefit at the request of several
members. That decision has raised
considerable controversy.
Members of the board of directors
received complaints by individuals
as to the political stance involved
in Nissan's decision. Members of
the Board Kathy Hanks, Dick Vos,
and Bob Winters said the main
problem was that Nissen didn’t
clear the decision widi the board
and that ”As a business institution
and as a service to membership,
we don‘t think we can afford to
take any political stance without
alienating customers,” (members
or nonvmembersl.

They defined a political issue as
any affair which draws as much
attention, division, and con
troversy as this. The three
members drew up a tentative
proposal to be put before the
Board.

Nissen claims his decision was
purely business and within bounds
of his managerial capacity.

seconded and resolution was ap- ,

proved by acclamation. The
resolution states: “Resolved that:
We the SGA Joint Boards, un
derstand that the victims of the
recent drug arrests are members
of this college community who face
pressures incomparable to our
own. We express our concern for
their situations and for ﬁleir un-
certain futures. Above all, we

emphasize that those arrested, as ’

members of the human com~
munity, deserve our humanitarian
and economic support rather than
our political animosity,”

The initial impetus for raising
money for the defendants occurred
impromptu last weekend during
the Grinnell Relays, shortly after
news of the arrests had spread.

Since then, several concerned
students have organized a Mutual
Defense Fund, collecting donations
in the Post Office and outside the
dining halls. According to Karen
McCarty, besides having political
convictions about the fairness of
the drug laws involved, those
organizing the fund are simply
interested in providing the best
defense for those who couldn't
otherwise afford it,

As of press time, they had
collected approximately $300. This
money does not include that raised
during a benefit at the Pub Club
Tuesday night, According to
manager Mark Nissen, customers
wishing to give to the defense were
charged an extra nickel for every

Committee

surprises
boards

In a quick, decisive move the
Joint Boards voted to fully support
the media budgets as recom-
mended by the Student
Publications and Radio Com-
mittee. Bypassing Wednesday
night’s decision of the SGA finance
committee to cut media allocations
by $500, individual members of
that same committee moved to
reinstate the original media budget
proposals. The major objection to
the finance committee's Wed-
nesday decision was voiced by
committee member Steve Kristal,
who said that the final proposal
was made hastily. “We had been
there for four hours and most of us
just wanted to get out,” he said.

Mark Nissen, SGA treasurer
voiced dissent saying, “I thought
we made the decision last night.”
But, the finance committee
members pushed ahead with
debate on the advisability of giving
extra money to budgets which had
not been adequately defended,
such as those of the individual halls
and the Social Coordinator, and
penalizing media b s whi

had been defended by personal
representatives.

Matt Cohen, chairman of the
Student Publications and Radio
committee, challenged Nissen’s
suggestion of cutting 5&3 and
[<ch for the benefit of hall funds.
He said that as proposed the media
budgets were at the barest
minimum, especially with regard
to the newspaper which is facing a
10 percent rise in printing costs and
deficit caused by last year‘s
budgetary oversight. He argued
for the maintainance of quality
communications on campus, which
cannot be maintained if there are
cuts.

“The critical point here is that
whereas Cuts from media will be
felt significantly, a cut of $.50 per
student in hall funds will only be
felt in terms of a few less mars
shmallows or something,” he
emphasized.

Nissen countered by saying that
the question was, is the 8&3 worth
the amount of money proposed He
questioned whether or not even a
maintainance of so eightrpage
issues was warranted. Several
joint board members, including
Russ Damtoft of Loose Hall, in-.
dicated they thought it was.

Further questions dealt with the
subject of media and SGA salaries,
the necessity of KDIC news ser-
vices, the necessity of twelverpage
SStB issues, and the nature of
student, faculty, parent, and
alumni SkBrsubscription rates.

'Jim Freeman, member of the
finance committee, moved that the
budget be approved as follows:
SGA, $2,825; Auditor, $650;
Grapevine, $1,000; Hall funds, $5.10
ea. students$5,9s7; Initiative Fund,
$5,500: Social Coordinator, $34,435;
KDIC.,$3,000; Scarlet and Black,
53,500; The Grinnell Book, from;
Public Events, $3,500, The total
expenditures for SGA will be
$76,877. This was passed by a vote
of 15-2.

The substantial changes which
were made were a cutback to the
present level in hallrfunds, and a
slight increase to the Social
Coordinator.

Other matters discussed at the
SGA meeting, other than the issue
of the defense aid for Grinnell
students involved in the. recent
drug arrests, dealt with various
matters. Sue Crim presented the
new paint policy for next year. She
said that the number of colors
available Will be increased to 167.
and that Building and Grounds
crew will either do the painting or
will supervise students choosmg to
paint their own rooms

Joe Spiro, Mara Porper and John
Haigh were confirmed as the
members of the All Campus
Judicial council. Porper and Haigh
are unanimously conllrnied.

A proposal was brought to the
boards concerning the pOSSIbility
of students being allowed to get off
board for religious rcasons, i.e,,
keeoing kosher.
