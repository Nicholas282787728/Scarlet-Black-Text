1‘ Grinnellians form
NOW Chapter

by Debliie Wcincr
The issue of women's rights has
can a frequent topic of discussion
’ in Grinnell this year, One positive
result of the sometimes confusing,
otten rhetorical ongoing debate has
been the formation of a Grinnell
‘chapter oi the National
Organization [or Women (NOW).
The group will hold its tlrst
meeting Tuesday, Feb. l at 7:30
p in the Steiner Religious AC-
tivlties Room. Any inhabjtant at
Grinnell, male or .female, town~
sperson or student, is invited to
attend.

Jeanne Burkle, Margaret Kiesel
and Ellyn Toscano conceived the
notion of starting a Grinnell
chapter late last semester. A core
oiinterested persons developed the
idea further, and a preliminary

eeting in December attracted 50
people The group as yet has one
planned activity, a iund-raising
book sale to be held next month.

The priorities for Grinnell’s

ENOW chapter have not yet been
established Prompted by recent
campus issues, some women have
suggested affirmative action and
sex stereotyping in faculty
positions as tentative items tor
investigation, Sexism in the public
schools, the employment of women
in the Grinnell area, and Working
Conditions of Grinnell working
women have also been mentioned,
During the NOW meetings. task
forces will be formed to deal with
whatever subjects members of the

Qgroup are interested in. “The
organization is wide enough,"
according to Jeanne Burkle, to
accomodate different interests.

“We want the emphasis to be on

ction.” Commented Ellyn
Toscano. Consciousness raising
\Vill probably play a part in the
group’s activities, but she hopes
that the various task forces Will
also be able to bring about concrete
change where needed, Toscano will
be conducting a research project
on the employment oi women in
Grinnell. Investigations will not
always be easy, noted Burkle,
mentioning that in such cases as
~ llege hiring, it is “difficult to

etermine whether discrimination
has occurred.” The group will have
cess to resources all over Iowa.

NOW will also make use at these
resources with informative leer
tures and discussions

Toscano hopes NOW will act as a
”linking organization between the
town and College." The Grinnell
group will have a great deal at
autonomy. The state and national
organizations restrict local

chapters from “being against-
national, _
:organization is for,” according to
_Toscano, but‘ local chapters are

something the

tree to set their own priorities.
The National Organization for
Women was started in 1966 as an
organization dedicated to
achieving equality tor women.
There are now more than 50,000
members in 700 chapters around
the country. NOW has con
centrated on action in a Wide
variety oi areas. including
religion, education, women and
poverty, law, sports, medicine,
women and the arts, divorce, labor
unions, and employment, It has
assisted in the passing of sex
discrimination legislation.
Margaret Kiesel is the chair-
person ol the Grinnell chapter oi
NOW. Jeanne Burkle is publicity
chairperson, and Adie Goldberg is
the treasurer. Kathy Staudt and
Babe Voertmann are the program
chairpeople. These positions are
only temporary, however, and
elections will be held ”soon,"

‘ according to 'Jeanne Burkle, Dues

for full membership will be $25 per
year. However, partial meme
berships with partial dues are
available, including a $2 student
membership.

Tederman sees Latimer as an

“administrative support" peison
According to Turner, Latimer will
“generate various social and
recreational activities which have

not yet been thought oi."
Latimcr sees the campus
calendar as a “a useful admission
tool" and wishes to assure the
campus community that it will be

responsibility.
