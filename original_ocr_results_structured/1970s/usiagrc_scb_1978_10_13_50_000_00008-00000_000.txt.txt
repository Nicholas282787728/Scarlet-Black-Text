Well. it’s that time again. Mid-
terms are rolling around, and you
find yourself increasingly making
that familiar jaunt to the library.

You carefully pick a secluded
spot which might prove a bit
difficult), settle in, arrange your
books so that both you and they are
perfectly comfortable. you get up,
sharpen your pencil (and, passing
by the drinking fountain, succumb
to the temptation of a little nip),
return to your seat, wriggle a bit,
whisper a icw words to a friend at
the next carrel, settle in again. and

~ ther%you‘re all set. Ready for a
diligent night of hitting the books.
Ahh! Worthwhile toil.

BUT . . . IT'S BEEN a long day.
The glaring overhead lights beat
mercilessly upon you, and their
buzzing provides constant torture.
Yuu shiver in the rarefied air of
this place of learning twhy is it that
rareﬁed air always seems to be
around so degrees? l. The people at
the next table have decided to
torment you with their loud

 

provide you with our own modest
list of interesting, entertaining,
edifying, morally uplifting and
occasionally hilarious books.

THE ROMANCE of the Fungus
World. Now there's a title to spark
the imagination and perk up the
weary mind. The book is an “ac
countof fungus life in its numerous
guises, both real and legendary.”
The authors, F.W. and RT. Rolfe,
obviously have a great fondness
for, well . . . fungus,

The table of contents coveis
everything from “fungi in
mythology and folk—lore" to “the
study of fungi as a hobby." One
mischievous reader added his own
chapter: “Sexy slime tie, how
slime molds really teen.”

While we're on romances. The
Romance of Life Insurance is
another thriller
guaranteed to provide hours of
fastcpaced pleasure, Published in
1908 by William J. Graham, the
book received a favorable review
from Teddy Roosevelt, who stated,

“The business of life insurance

vitally afiectsthe great mass of the
American people.” l-iis visage,
along with this quote. adorns the
frontispiece.

For something a little more
prosaic (we don't want to get too
excitedithis is, after all, the
library) pick up the library’s copy
of The Laundry industry. This
book topped the best seller list in
1950. The author, Fred DeArmond.

start: “It was just another blue

career.

whispering and slowly, im-
perceptibly and willfully, your
eyes begin to close. You jerk your
head up from where it has dropped
onto the table and say to yourself:
“Study break,"

At the mere thought of the
phrase, you perk up. Now that
you’ve decided to take a little
break, you’re not quite so tired.
You hop up energetically from
your seat,

BUT WHERE DO you go? The

’ Forum? Well, you’ve spent your

last dime, and a person can only

drink so much coffee. Your mom?

Nothing interesting there.

All right, so the subject of
laundry is not suited to everyone’s
tastes. We Can't miss with the
subject of sex, though. The library
holds numerous books which are
not only risque, but downright
offensive.

Sex and the College Girl (written
in 1954 by Gael Greene) is of
particular interest to those of you
who were wondering what college
is really all about. This book gives
it to you straight.

Most revealing are the
accounts by professors oi how they-
“award” grades to female
students—and they don't mean for
good grammar. One proiessor had
trouble keeping his books from
falling off the bookshelves while in
conference with a ”voluptuous
young co-ed." Need we say more?

Now, if you prefer a mildly
amusing study break to the more
puerile experiences described
above, possibly one of the following
books on social manners is for you.

WHY IS A DRESS?—an inc
triguing question, and one often
posed at social gatherings on
camous, The card catalog

dress? by Elizabeth Dawes. Who?
What? When? Where?” This book,
written in i942, unilinchingly
reveals the answers.

it examines such topics as the
aesthetic reasons for ending a
dress at the knee, the decorative
dilemma of “white Collar girls,"
and “Modesty a Form of Sex
Appeal." Dawes's closing words
exhort the reader, “Get going.
then! And iflhis book is any help to
you in finding the way, dedicate
yourself to the proposition that all
American women may have
beautiful clothes." This may come
‘as a relief to at least half the
campus.

LET'S SET the Table (1938) is
probably the most outlandish book
title in the library. In this ”50031
manners" book author Elizabeth
Lounsbery offers the appropriate
table settings [or every occasion7
and we mean cvel‘yr

For instance, the next time you
host a ore-football luncheon, you
need not worry about selecting the
proper table setting. Just consult
Elizabeth. She bubbles, “the table
should take on the enthu5lasm and
spirit of the game.” Literally. "On
a bed of leaves, there may be
placed the head and shoulder
guard of a football player, In the
space intended for the head, you
can substitute a football, which
assumes a surprisingly human
appearance when disguised in this
way," Your guests will love it. The

color of the table cloth, of course“

should match the school colors.
