GREGORIAN ORGANIC

Evocation of castle,

Invocation of godless,

Strong men, musical

In life, an organ’s pulse

And viral function- -

chanted mystically,

in resonant vibration.

Thus came the bells,

And the hard chords

0f disonance; and then

The resolution like a sudden

Morning, like a sudden snow.

The resolution spreading deep,

Entrancing liberation slow

In hastening ancience.

The resolution dancing green

In waves across dreaming,

In stare crested armor.

A wondrous, fine night.
~Sherry Mayrent

The Early Gods

From the fire in the east,

a day forms the forces,

evolution and creationr

the artistry of slow growth.

I recognised your path over my past,
saw you take shape in my new day,
but underestimated the person

you'd grown to be.

Grown to a blacksmith:
to bring iron to fire

and there to liquify

the unyielding;

to fit together the scraps
of our castiron past;
grown to lull the two of us
into the art of one.

In the hollow places,

the round curves,

of that new sculpture

the time of our own evolution _

has come, giving body

to the soul within us

that escapes a primaeval sea;

here our timelessness becomes forever.

Ba rba ra Swift

A Alfred de Vigny
”II a beaucoup songe . . ."
ewhen autume mme
and the leaves fell
aching to the earth
bearing the colors
of his once-wild ink.

-when his palm dropped
idly and his fingers

felt the nuts and berries
(the living eggs of autumn)

meaningless in his hand.

~when his stars opened
but his eyes closed

as the beat of regiments
became his meter,

repeated order his only rhyme.

in the moments

when light and color
turned the grey hours

to a deep, stagnant pain
that formed no word.

-when his time stopped,

his body hesitated
and the old eye

saw the patterns of concepts
lying in the scars of his hand.

rwhen some light
woke him in his sleep

to the blackness all about him
and he almost wept

for the silence.

And his thoughts grew louder
than the meter,

Once objects probed, encroaching, on our lies,
And sang cold songs of cracking bones and sight;
Once gods entrapped our voices in their eyes,

In foreign eyes propped up by foreign light;

grew stronger than the steel,
grew greater than the war,
“Ila beaucoup songe . . ."
-until he drowned

Once Torquemada in his Sunday best in the rush

Grives sorely the constriction of his tongue; of his ﬂooding pain

Once in the cells of power insects winked, and pressed as it washed his hand
Our splintered shadows on the stalking sun. clean from the blackness.

Once gods invented us. Their strangling dictions Barbara Swift
Linger stubborn in our motives; their ancient temper prods
Betrayal by its fathers. And in our cries

The seeds of formal plan grew strong: our fictions
Swelled with trappings of great might. The early gods
Remain. Their litanies fill the Skies.

CELEBRATION/APOCALYPSE

Timber lane, of fever soil sprouted,

Ground of tired history remains

The product of a cooler age, composed, collapsed
From vision: tomorrow's graying possibilities.
We trust no understanding" the embers long lost“
Of grace, a time to fulfill, recount,

To consider the calm between rages unnoticed.
Bursting breakapart knowing is dead.

The forest so easily lost

Lends no smile to an age.

Sleeping eyes (an mrry no longer

The bother ofa single tear,

Regretful shrug for mourning;

Another burial comes and goes.

In silence, the secret direction,
Somewhere within a spark lies the answer
Awaiting the word, one message, one call.

Breath comes too slowly, but just then too fast
Fire in air fills thirsty pores

Gaining, growing, filling up Lhe land

While thrust and carry come the motion.

‘ Heads become tails and quiet loud,

Brewing over brims too short to contain,
Past the valleys that lean toward sky;
Off, up again to home.
