Grinnell Ripolfs

by Mark Sablemon

Every year, thousands of dole
lars worth of goods andmoney
is stolen from Grinnell Cole
lege, college students, and
businesses in the tovm ofGrin-
nell. By far the greatest am?
ount of this loss is due to theft
by students.

Theft at Grinnell ranges in
kind and frequency from the
very prevalent theft of food
from Saga food service, thrr
ough shoplifting at the college
book store and town busines—
ses, to such semi—profes-
sional forms as forgery of
signatures on lost or stolen
checks. In addition, there
have been a number of thefts
of wallets and cash and credit
cards from dormitories and
locker rooms. And Hurling
library must redirect a sig-
niﬁcant portion of its yearly
budget into replacing stolen
library books.

Saga director Jerry Ramak~
er told the 5&8 that he conr
siders it theft whenever stud-
ents take food out ofthe dining
rooms. "They have paid for
all that they can stuff in their
little tummys, butnone ofwhat
they stuff into their pockets,"
he explained. Students who
take food out of the dining
rooms have numerous justi-
ﬁmtions for it; some claim
that they are justified in tak-

,ing all the food they want for
themselves orothers, because
the food has already been paid
for, and some claim that they
are merely making up for a

At least some ofthe requests
made by Norris Hall residents
in their petition for repairs
(See the Feb. 5 5 ﬁt B) were
granted at a meeting of resi-
dents, the three deans, and
Housing Committee members.
()th Scribner, co-chairman
of the Committee for Emerr
goncy Re-construction, re»
ported that during the meet
ing: "The deans were given
a guided tour, and I think that
really made our point."

Some of the decisions were
tentative, such as making the
hall co-ed next year. There
was an equal amount of dis
cussion about the problem of
the numerous freshmen "ex-
iled" to the Norrises. Scribe
ner said, "They (the deans)
weren’t too excited about that
situation, but maybe some—
thing will happen. I think we
may set up ratios that won’t
be as easily ignored as they

missed meal. However, the
board rate is not figured on
100% attendance, and most
students are aware that costs
would increase if this were
the case, Ramaker said.

There is some theft of food
from breakrins into the dining
rooms after regular hours,
Ramaker said. In some places,
this happens at regular inter-
vals, he said, but Saga has
thus far only tried to prevent
this by changing locks on
doors; they have not yet pro-
secuted.

ed of one group on campus
which regularily breaks into
the Saga dining rooms and
kitchens late at night. This
group of approximately twenty
people In one residence hall
has a mock organizational st—
ructure centering around the
activity of stealing food from
Saga for late night snacks.

Last week, an 5&8 reporter
accompanied three members
of the group on a ”raid." The
leader, obviously experien-
ced, took the group up to the
dining room door, swiftly
picked the lock using a pocket
knife blade, and let himself
and the others in.

Once inside, the group headed
to the juice and the chocolate
milk, and began filling up a
pitcher with chocolate milk.
Unfortunately Saga had not
been very thoughtful of them as
mere wasn't enough milk to
fill the pitcher. They debated
changing the cow for Saga
(and themselves), but decided

Definite plans for repair in-
clude improvements in the
heating system, which ., “is
very difficult to regulate be-
cause of what Scribner mlled
“incredibly poor design."
None of the rooms have ceil-
ing light fixtures, and rewi -
ing for these would be entire—
ly too expensive. Instead, the
college hopes to make study
lamps or pole lamps avail-
able to neXt year’s residents.
The building's drab walls,
which were neverpainted, will
receive some color this some

was delegated to talk color
schemes with members of the
art department. If costs are
not prohibitive, the doors,
halls, and rooms of the Nora
rises will be painted various
complementary colors, in~
stead of the usual dormitory
beige.

To combat the noiseproblem
and make the hall generally
more pleasant, carpeting will
be installed in the hallways
and probably in the lounges.
A system of insulation may
be put in the air ducts above
each room door. Finally, all
cracks around doors and in
the walls will be calked.

As the group u including-the
5&8 reporter , A began to leave
the dining room, they saw a
person as the night watchman
-~ approach from outside. One
member of the group was al-
ready outside, but the others
stayed inside the darkened
di 'ng room.The memberoutr
side, after a fifteen minute
chat with the night watchman,
returned to tell the rest of
the group that the coast was
clear.

The members of the group
discussed their tactics and
philosophy with the SEtB re-
porter over a glass of chocOr
late milk. "lt’s'totally imr
moral," the leader admitted,
“to rip off for the thrill of
ripping off." There are many
reasons the individuals in the
group like to raid Saga -- be-
cause it's fun, a diversion,
something to do, because there
is a feeling of belonging to
the group, because of hatred
of Saga . . . even because,
for one individual, of the good
taste of Saga‘s chocolate milk.

Choeolate milk and juices in
no way constinite all of the
groups‘ spoils -— in the past
they have stolen turkey, cake,
pie, ice cream, pastry,fritos,
potato chips, loaves of bread,
oranges, apples, bananas,
grapes, puddings, silverware,
salt shakers, sugar, ketchup,
and Saga hats.’l‘he theftseems
to be justified to the members
of the group since it satisfies
their late night appetites, and
gives them an outlet "to be
purposefully immature.”

They told the 88:13 reporter
that if Saga were open for
snacks, there wouldbe no need
for them to steal. Of course,
they realize that there is little
liklihood that Sage will open
up for snacks between mid-
night and three or four o‘clock
in the morning. After their
interview, members of the
group made the 5&8 reporter
an honorary member of their
organization.

Apparently late night break'
ins are still a novelty, and
Saga director Ramaker told
the 5&8 that much more food
goes out of Saga with students
as they leave the dining room
than from break—ins. He said
that it is very difficult to stop
such theft ,_ when Sagawork-
ers try to stop other students
who are taking food out of the
dining room, the students give
the workers a "tremendous
amount of grief."

Although it is impossible to
estimate how much is lost by
Saga from theft of food, Ra-
maker was able to determine
that $2,000 is lost each year
in silverware and china from
theft. Loss offoodis especial'
ly high at the Forum Grill --
the Grill is running ata loss
of several thousand dollars so
far this year.

review which appeared in

review may be found in the

Don't kid yourself. Grand
Funk Railroad is one of the
worst groups to ever force
themselves upon the music
world. Their ”Live Album"
Album? it's a doubleaalbum
filled with enough noise to
madden even the biggest
“acid-rock fraks." I'm not
against loud concerts, if the
performers play musicl (Jefr
ferson Airplane, for example.)
But I can't standplastic, phony
"a cid" groups that try to make
it on how loud they can play._
If you like this sort of stuff,
better you should sit in a sub-
way station for a few hours
listening to the trains coming
in. It's a hell ofa lot cheaper.
