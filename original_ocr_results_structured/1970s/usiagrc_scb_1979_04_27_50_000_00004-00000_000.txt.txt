Compromise

should pass

The proposal to change the grading system that the
faculty will consider Monday represents a conscientious
effort to reconcile two conﬂicting points of View.

Early this semester, Dean of the College Waldo Walker
released results of an informal survey which showed the
faculty is overwhelmingly in favor of changing the grading
system. Sixty-seven of 73 respondents indicated they
supported a change.

WITH THIS KIND of sentiment for change, the Com-
mittee on Academic Standing's proposals are remarkably
moderate. They preserve some of the positive characteristics
of the current system, while making enough changes to
satisfy critics of the current system.

The system used now by the college is ideal for students.
It allows them maximum flexibility in deciding whether to
stay in or drop out of courses. In addition, it encourages
students to explore diverse areas of study. Students who
ordinarily would be unwilling to take certain courses because
of the threatof failinpuiow are free to try fields in which they
don't feel competent.

Unfortunately, the current system does have problems.
Apparently. large numbers of students have been dropping
courses solely to avoid receiving mediocre grades. The
current system also poses problems because it undermines
the credibility of a Grinnell transcript, since no failures are
iecorded.

FORTUNATELY. THE COMMlTTEE has retained a
leasonable method for students to drop courses. Although
students an no longer wait until the last minute to drop, the
committee proposes setting a more than adequate 10 week
deadline on drops.

By the tenth week. as Roger Knestor argued last Week. a
student should have a pretty good idea of how he or she is
faring in a course. lll addition. setting a deadline s tisfiet‘l
those faculty members who expressed concern that students
were dropping courses capriciously and irresponsibly.

THE PRESENT GRADING a stem is not perfect.
Faculty members concerned about ’SpOllSllJlB dropping of
t'OulSCs and the fallacy of computing a grade-pom average
it ithniit a bot tom figure ([0 have a legitimate concern.

‘Al the Same time, however. the legitimate concerns of
students need to lie considered as well. Students are afraid
that bringing hack the F and eli‘miiiatincv the drop option will
add to academic pressure.

Given these two conflicting points of View, the Committee
on Academic Standing's proposal for grade reform is a
worthy compromise, The faculty should adopt it.
