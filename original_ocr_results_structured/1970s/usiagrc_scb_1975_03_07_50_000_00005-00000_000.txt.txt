The people
speak

To the Editor:

iwish to thank publicly the thirty
people who had the courage and
audacity to write in my name ior
the presidency of SGA. I would also
like to congratulate Will Collins on
his victory last Friday. However, i
have discussed the matter with my
high-level political strategists and
other poll, sci. majors, and ive
unanimously agree that thirty
Votes for a writesin candidate who
publicly announced his entry into
the race but twelve hours before
the election is nothing short oi a
mandate, I hear the voice of the
people and I shall obey, i wish to
announce a bloodless coup
estahlising me as your new student
government president. As greater
political leader than I once said:
Rebels are \vesBorn to be freesJust
like the fish in the sea. Let that be
our battle cry as we march against
the oppressive toes that mar and
destroy the Grinnell experience ior
so many, Foes like bad govern
ment, academic pressure poor
housing, and lack oi social activity.
We shall overcome!

But how, you ask. Through the
immediate implementation oi my
campaign platform. To w .

—-Bad government The SGA is
hereby dissolved. In its place shall
be erected an absolute monarchy.
Cabinet meeting will be held in the
throne room, ARH 11, only on my
whims, and I don’t have whims
very oiten.

iAcademic pressure. To rid the
campus oi academic pressure. I
proposed in my platiorm to do
what great leaders such as Folk,
McKinley and Roosevelt did when
time got toughigo to war. And so
we shall. All Ain Civ, sections and
all Bio. minisunlts will be called up
Monday morning at 10:00 to
prepare to go into battle against all
other ACM colleges, to whom i
have sent declarations of war.
After we conquer the ACM, we
shall go ior victory against the
Leviathan states in Iowa City and
Amos. Those people who do not go
into battle are welcome to help me
bake some special brownies for the
troops and ior ourselves.

—Poor housing Construction on
the new 46~story highsrise dor-
mitory, to he named Monty Hall,
will begin with a groundbreaking
ceremony held by Bob Jacobs on

central campus ate am March ii,-

Demolishing of the tenement
housing in which we presently live
will begin at loam, the same day,
as Mears Hall will be razed to the
ground. The homeless will be able
to live at Jacobs’ house at 923
Eighth Avenue. The new dorm,
Monty Hall, will ieature a single
for every student here. The
number of rooms in the single will
be determined by the number of
years the occupant has attended
this institution: however, only
seniors get the pool-terrace option.
Each apartment will be furnished
with television, air conditioning,
and a double bed—with guaranteed
occupancy therein,

iLzlck oi sbcail activity. Each
Wednesday iolloiving break, the
Forum will feature a cocaine and
Southern Comfort study break.
There will be a Three Stooges
movie every weekend, and the first
weekend in May will feature the
Ronald Reagan Film Fe 'val,
including ‘Knule RockneiAll
Alnerican' and ‘llearl of Hearts.’
The third weekend in April has
been designated for a Symposium
on American Humo Guests so far
include actor Jei- Van Dyke,
comics Totie Fields and London
LCc. Comic artist Ernie Bllshs
miller, and columnist Erma
Bombec ,Wc are presently in

as commencement speaker this
year. Each week there will be a
special hanging-in-eiiigy on
central campus, My cousin, Stevie
Wonder, has assured me that he
will give a concert in Roberts
sometime in May. And there will
be more.

My only goal in assuming this
office is making Grinnell a better
place to live and work. By working
together, you, the students, and I
can achieve this previously elusive
goal. Finally, let me assure you oi
one thing! am not a crook.

To the Editor.

In the last three years there has
been a sharp decline in the degree
of student awareness as to what
SGA has been doing tor not dotngl
for the student body. SGA is I'm
longer (if It has ever beenl El
serious focal point of student in
volvement because it has failed to
generate the disgustingly huge
amount oi controversy necessary
to make our hali imaybc J .i asleep
student bodies stand up and shout a
little.

Dan Finkelman is running for
SGA vice president. What can you
say about Dan Finkelman? Some
people will tell you that he is a loud
mouth, obnoxious sonoﬂabltch
who talks too much. This lllay be
true, it certainly earned him the
number two spot on the Top Ten
Asshole list in Blirling basement.
But there is another point oi view
here Danisalsoa concerned, well-
informed, hard-working ins
dividual. He is a very intense and
serious person who does not take
SGA, lhe vicespresidencvhol'
student opinion lightly, He is
seeking this job because he has
ideas (and damn good onesl that
he would like to bring about on this
campus,

What do you get when you cross a
loudsmoulh soil of a bitch with a
concerned and hard working in-
dividual? You get someone who is
not atraid, when the time comes, to
stand up and tell someone
(student, iaculty, or ad-
ministrator) that he or she is lull of
horse dung. Combine that with an
active person with good ideas and
you've got one hell or a good SGA
vice president. I seriously
recommend that you consider Dan
Finkelman’s platform. With
student involvement going slowly
down the drain, this may be our
last chance to elect someone to
SGA with the potential to put a
little more activity into Student
Government.

Ferrell

To the Editor'

Having known Joe Ferrell for
two and a half years, it is my belief
that he is eminently qualified ior
the office of Student Government
Association Vice President. As
Norris Hall Social Coordinator alld
Main Hall SGA Representative, he
has demonstrated the initiative,
integrity, and common sense
required to deal effectively with
the faculty, administration, and
trustees. His preVious experience
in Student Government has, I
helicve, given him a good uns
derslanding oi campus politics;
but as a notoriously independent
thinker, he has gained this prac-
tical experience without hccoining
committed to the loibles oi past
administrations, i know Joe
Ferrell is worthy or my support
and I believe he is worthy of yours

To the Editor:

Joe Ferrell knows how to deal
with the student bureaucracy as
well as anyone that l know, i also
believe he will provide the proper
complement to thc new SGA
President. and thus provide a
united student leadership which
will be vital during the upcoming
year

Private
landscapes

by Richard Cleaver

The public has an opportunity to see western landscapes through the
eyes of Bart ,Morse in the Schacffer Gallery through March 16, The
current exhibition includes paintings, drawings, and one etching by
Morse, who works in a peculiar blend of representational and ims
pressionistic styles,

Morse’s work, which comes in all sizes, shows an objective concern
with detail which is balanced by subjectivity in tile representation oi
landscapes it is this tension which is the strength or the show, when if
is kept in control

It is the subjective element which motivates the painted borders or
frames so striking in many canvases, This whimsical touch is used to
its best effect in the large oil Wasatch Front, \there the mountain
scene is surrounded by a red, White, and blue double-arched frame. To
the tourist, western scenery oi the type depicted by Morse oiten gives
the feeling oi a living postcard or shadowbox; these borders give the
same sense to the viewer, They are sometimes overdone, however, as
in Rinioii mountain Diamond, where the frame becomes the painter's
preoccupation, rather than the scene inside it.

The large paintings are the most obvious works to the visitor. They
are, alas, the least successiul. ln lheiii the artist seems occasionally to
have let his objective impulses wander from the work itself to the
elemenB thereof, chiefly the color and the paint. His color schemes
throughout the Show seem to be based on trial and error rather than
planning, and this method rails most iiotahly in these large pieces
which need the coherence a wellsthoughtsout scheme might lend.
Further, he occasionally becomes entranced by the paint itseli, which
results in a mosaic effect which is not particularly sliccessful, and
sometimes is oiiensively intrusive, given the representational nature
oi these paintings.

These laults are less apparent in the smaller paintings, especially
lhe watercolors. In those, the artist's coiiiposttional sense is more
manifest, and in some pieces, the combination of this with sensitive
coloring is very eiiective, as, ior example, the small Tno Trees,
perhaps the iinest painting in the show, Rich Ficllls is a similarly
outstanding work.

It is the drawings which are the real attraction of the exhibition.
Here we can see the artist’s skills in Composition in fine control
lespccially since these are mostly very small). while his subjective
eye is still at work, The use ofl varying weights oi line, and the
economy or strokes in these pieces, all in pencil, proJect a distinct
impression of individual vision. Rock Mountain best exemplifies the
simplicity and concentration ot purpose that viviiy the drawings.

There is only one etching in the exhibition, Organic Garden; in it
there is the same concern with line which Is so evident in the drawings,
this (line used as a compositional device The result is disappointing,
in fact. the presence oi one graphic work in a show consisting oi
paintings and drawings is somehow disorienting, unsatisfactory. The
other fault of the collection as a whole is the sameness of the pains
tings: more oi the drawings. perhaps, would have been clcome,
maybe paintings could have been chosen to exhibit more var g . One
student remarked, “i get tired of exhibits which consist of the same
picture over and over," Some attention ought to be paid to such
matters,

The overall impression one gels of Mol‘se’s work is of a careful,
meticulous artist, concerned tperhaps to excess) with detail, and
aware oi the need for rigor. Dryness is avoided by a measured amount
or whimsy. and a willingness to explore his media. Although these two
sides oi his work are olteii unbalanced. in those pieces (particularly
drawings) where balance is achieved they are in a tension which is
very successlul, '
