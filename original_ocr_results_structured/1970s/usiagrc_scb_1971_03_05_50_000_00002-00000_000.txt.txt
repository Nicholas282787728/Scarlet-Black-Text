THE SCARLET AND BLACK

Protesters Toss Snowbolls, Curses

the building, but were repul-
sed by the state patrol, who
rapped their knuckles with
their everrpresent billy clubs.
The crowd was by no means
united. The old questioned the
intentions of the young. The
workers questioned the chants
of the students. The students
questioned the values of the
workers, but they stood side
by side when their national
leader emerged, and each side
had just a sharp a toungue
toward Nixon.

As the corps of pressman
emerged from the building,
a barrage of snowballs greets
ed them, and they made a
hasty retreat to their waiting
buses. The usual officials ex-
ited next, and then the man of
the hour, who emerged to a
round of boos, obsenities, and
snowballs. He waved and
smiled to the crowd of Orr
lockers and gave them the
peace sign (”I like to do it
because itmakes them (peace-
niks) mad"). He later remark-
ed that this demonstration was
par for the course but thatthe
snowballs werea bitamateur
ish. (Might I add that Nixon’s
performance could also merit
that classification.)

With the departure, the

Mogee Plan Gives Executive Council Top Power

(continued from page 1)

The text of the proposal is
as follows:

I. All standing committees
of the faculty shall be abol-
ished except the Committee
on Academic Standing and the
Admissions Committee. Fac-
ulty membership on other
committees should be ended.
II. The Executive Council of
the Faculty

A. The Executive Council of
the Faculty shall consist of
the Chairmen of the five divi‘
sions (as provided for in Pre~
sident Leggett's proposal)
plus one other representative
from each division plus the
Chairman of the Faculty. Th»
ese shall be elected as they
are presently.

B. The President, the Dean
of the College and the Dean of
Administration Shall be ex-
officio members ofthe Execu-
tive Council without vote.

C. The chairman of the Exe-
cutive Council shall be the
Chairman of the Faculty, who
shall be responsible for the
preparation of all agenda for
the Council.

D. The Executive Council
shall have oversight of the
curriculum, shall make re-
commendations to the PICSid’
ent on all matters related to
faculty personnel, shall pre-
pare regularandperiodicana‘
lyses andprojections oftrends
within college operations for
the faculty's guidance, and
shall serve as a general ads
visory board to the President.
It shall also be a major chan*
nel for liaison and communis
cation between the faculty and
the administration

E. For such purposes the
Executive Council shall have
the right to form itself into
sub- committees andassociate
with its work sixstudents sel-
ected by whatever means the
student body shall decide upon.
These students shall have full
voting privileges on the Coun‘
cil and in all committees on
which they serve.

F. It is recognized that on
certain matters ,, particular-
ly personnel matters involv—
ing discussions of individual

crowds overran the fences
and chased the speeding limt
ousine as far as they could.
Workers marched to the Fort
Dodge Hotel in protest ofNixr
on's economic policies. Stud-
ents made their way to the
hotel both on foot and in cars
as did the remaining segment
of the crowd. As we drove to
the hotel, I noticed a broken
window in the capital, and a
bright red swastika on the
side ofa police car.

At the hotel, all street and
alleys had been blocked off.
The helicopter was ever prev
sent, and police were posted
on the roofs ofall surrounds
ing buildings. The crowd had
decreased in size, being com-
posed in the majority with
students; however, somewor-
kers, women, and farmers had
remained. I noticed various
Grinnell people mingling in
the crowd; we gathered toge-
ther and chanted a few of the
oldies but goodies . . . ”Ho,
Ho, Ho, Chi Mihn, NLF is
going to win . . ." Other
cheers arose but the demons
stration remained relatively
quiet. As the crowd pressed
forward, police asked them to
step back, to which the pro-
testers responded by sitting
down. The police then moved
in some chartered buses to

contracts and salary discusr
sionsrsstudents might nor
mally be expected tobe exclu-
ded from direct participation.
G. In order to ensure that a
valid and consistent student
input is provided for on per
sonnel matters, the Executive
Council shall give urgent pr-
iority to assisting the Student

-Government Association in

developing a manageable sys-
tem of course evaluation.
III. Standing Committees.

A. The academic Smnding
Committee shall have the
same membership it now has.
Faculty membership shall be
chosen by the sameballotpro-
cedure as the Chairman ofthe
Faculty who shall arrange the
details of the election. This
committee shall have final
jurisdiction on waiver of gra-
duation requirements, acade-
mic dismissals, and msesin-
volving academic dishonesty,
except that any student may
appeal the decision of the
committee to the President,
who may involve any advisory
group he wishes. Recommen»
dations which the Adadernic
Standing Committee may wish
to make on general college
academic policy shall be sent
to the Executive Council. The
Executive Council may re—
quest the Committee to make
such studies as eitheritor the
Council may feel isnecessary
for Council consideration of
current academic policies.

B. The Admissions Commit-
tee shall have the same mem-
bership as at present. It shall
report directly and regularly
to the Executive Council. The
Executive Council through the
Chairman of the Faculty shall
nominate the facultymembers
of the Committee and the Facr
ulty as a whole shall elect to
the committee from these nor
minces plus any other nominr
ations from the floor of the
Faculty. The student mem-
bership shall be chosen as at
prescnt. The Admissions Bos
ard shall remain as presently
constituted.

IV, Other faculty organization.

A. The Executive Council
shall create such faculty and
joint facultyrstudent subcom-
mittees from among its own

block any attemptsat crossing
the barricade (parts of which
had made theirway back to us).

A middle aged woman aps
proached us after we had fin-
ished another Ho, Ho cheer,
and explained to us her
reasons for being present on
the street. "'l‘hatson ofa bitch
Nixon promised to get us out
and the cocksuckerhasn’t done
a thing about it." I'm sure
even Nixon would have blush-
ed after her speech to us.

The excitement soon began
again. After a collection, a
group of individuals had pur
chased a supply of eggs and
proceeded to hurl the missiles
in the direction of the hotel.
The Des Moines police were
really not ready for this re-
ception and responded by
sending two waves of state
patrolmen against the studs
ents, clearing them away for
half a block. The patrolmen
then formed a line to prevent
any further incidents. Apparr
ently two arrests were made
in connection with these inci—
dents, but I didn't observe
mem.

The crowd began to mill and
await Nixon's departure. In
the meantime some chalk had
found its way to the crowdwho
proceeded to put it togooduse.
The street and several builds
ings were soon covered with

membership or shall appoint

committees from the faculty
and student body as shall be
necessary to carry out the
work of the Council.

v. The Faculty.

A. As is the case atpresent,
the Executive Council is re—
quired to bring before the ﬁc-
ulty for its formal approval
any changes in policyaffecting
the faculty or the curriculum
before they can be considered
official faculty positions or
legislation.

B. It is expected that the
Chairman of the Faculty will
make regular and substantive
reportsvhimself or in coop-
eration with appropriate
Council members _, to the
Faculty as a Wholeon the work
of the Executive Council and
on the state of- the College.
VI. The Divisional Strucmie

A. It is assumed thatthe new
divisional structure shall 09’
erate as outlined in President
Leggett’s proposal.

B. It is recommended that
the Chairmen ofDivisions plus
the Chairman of the Faculty
continue to operate as a buds
get committee for faculty sal-
ary recommendations.

graffitii Perhaps the bestwork
was a line drawn across the
street labeled "Freedom ends
here, Do you?" The remain
ing activities remained rather
peaceful. A group of us had
gone around the block to see
what was on the other side,
when who should appear but
the police escort and Nixon
himself in his nice black lim-
ousine. l-le waved to the crowd
smiled and gave them the
peace (they hate it) symbol.
The crowd in return gave him
the great American bird and
clenched fist. And so the lims
ousine drove peacefully (at 60
mph) out of sight, and an el-
derly lady commented, "Well,
now you've seen thepresident,
son," to a young child Stand’
ing next to her.

As Nixon’s plane (without
anti»pollution controls) lifted
into the sun we headed back
to Grinnell. The street crews
were out to erase the various
comments made about the
"leader" and the police head-
ed home to a long winter's
nap. I thought about the acti-
vities too as Idrove home in

The amateurish demonstra-
tion had had some meaning.
The peace movement, prev
iously basically ayouth orien-
ted and directed program, had
spread into the larger eler
ments of society. Mothers for
Peace and workers were just
as verbal in their condemnar
tion of the war as students. In
this ﬂeeting moment of coali»
tion a sense of solidarity chV
eloped. The so, called cooling
off period and apathetic atti ~
tude were stripped and stud-
ents were no longer questions
ing, but were answering the
questions thatcharges launch-
ed against them. Their posir
tion was no longer that of id~
ealism, but of rational thought.
Their issues were clear and
their support growing. This
"amatuerish" demonstration
is just'the starting point. The
elections are ahead. 'let her

bodies, but you'll never break

up the day.
