Meal Heads Have ‘Fine’ Power

by Don Dagenais

The Joint Board last Monday night
voted to give SAGA meal heads the right
to impose a line oi $1.00 on students who
reiuse to bus their trays at late dinner
meals The right to line was approved
alter an appeal by Chris Anderson colt»
cerning the recent problems with those
students who tiave been adamant about
busing their trays.

A iew days ago in cowles,Aiuierson roe
poi-ted, a student reiused to bus his tray
vtlten a SAGA worker requested he do so,
and "It almost resulted in a iist tight ll
SAGA does not have the authority to We
pose such tines by itseli. but the Joint
Board is authorized to give groups the
right to do so

Enloi-cement

The major point or discussion was the
methods by which the new line will be
enlorced. Terry Cililord cleared up the
debate when she iniormed the Boardthat
any such line would be subjecttopayment
to ttie Student Auditor's oiiice. andthata
student who reiuses to pay the iine could
have his transcript withheld. The line
can, oi course, be appealed to the Allr
Campus Judicial Council.

Alter a bit oi researching into Roberts
Rules oi order and counting heads, Bob
Meyer determined that indeed the Board
.did have a.quorum.present (14 or 21

members were there; aquorum requires
a 2/3 maiority), and couldthereiore vote
on the issue The motion passed unani-
mously

'Action’ Recruiters
Explain Programs

“Spreading the good word" about the
Peace Corps and VISTA programs, Cathy
Crow and “Noosn"Nishihar2 came to
the Grinnell campus on Tuesday and
Wednesday. in an lhlervtew with thesiita
the two ACTION recruiters talked about
their programs and how they could aiiect

_ college students,

“The Peace Corps opens up a lot oi
things you have never seen beiore When
you get back, the experience makes it
harder to work within a system that you
no longer completely believe in”. Noosh
continued, “The Peace Corps andvtSTA
are educations in themselves You can't
prepare yourseli ior this kind oi thing
with course work ”

The Peace Corps at the moment is
looking ior graduates in three iields -
Science, Mathematics, and Education
VISTA is much more ilexible » although
they urge applicants to earn their de-
grees beiore they apply, they stressthat
practical experience in community set»
vice work is oi great importance.

Both recruiters agreed that it was dilr
hunt to iiod placement - only one oi ten
applicants is accepted ior VISTA; the
iigure tor the Peace Corps is one or
twenty Further, almost iiity per cent
oi those accepted in the latter program
do not complete their training and begin
work in a ioreign country.

Noosh stressed that the eilortoigettiog
placed is worth it, because the rewards
are so great. “It’s not an eight to live
job - there are no supervisors standing
over you to see how last you are working.
You can work at your own rate, in your
own way. It’s really great, being agroup
of individuals doing something impor—
tant"

Peace corps workers have been
expelled irom many ioreign countries.
Noosh (who worked ior the Peace corps
in Nepal) explained “Peace Corps can
become a very political issue. Foreign
governments that want to show how
poweriui they are kick out the Peace
Corps because it is one way they can
kick the United states withoutbeing hurt
But that is lrrelavent, We are working
with people, not governments. That is
the great thing about the Peace corps .
we have iinally got a program that skips
the government oiiice and gets down to
working with people."

Cathy noted that the same thing is true
oi VISTA. “The programs are vehicles
to get people to work together. It's the
one to one relationships that make the
thing go H

Site added “Both programs want to, in
eitect, put themselves out of business.
The job is ongoing, it we do our work
well, there will be peoplemthecommun-
ity or in the country who can continue
the work we have been doingaiterwe are
gone,"

Both stressed that. while it was impor—

intellectual within the university, to women as a basis for

pating in the women's movement there. Times and subjects
of her speeches are in the last Campus Memo.

Chinese History, will speak on the subject ”China and the
United Nations" in the South Lounge at 8:00 PM Tuesday,
October 26. Following his lecture, which is being sponsored
by the History Department, he will answer questions from
the audience. Professor Hamilton notes thatstudents interested
in following the UN debates on the admission of Communist
China could hear them broadcast live on WSUI- AM and WOI- FM.

harpsichord player James Wyly will give a concert at 8 RM.

horror flick, “Horrors of Dracula,” at 9:30. All beasts and
ghouls are cordially invited to attend.

Poet Appearance Doubtful
The Grinnell appearance of Russian poet Andre Vez~
nesensky is still in doubt, according to Assistant Profes-

sor of History Gregory Guroff.

Guroif Wednesday announced that efforts to bringVoznesensky
to Grinnell are continuing. According to Guroff, Voznesensky's
appearance hinges upon the renewal of his visa to remain in
the United States, which in turn hinges upon action by the
Russian embassy making application for the extension to
the United States Department of State.

If the visa is renewed, Guroif states that he has received
assurances that Grinnell is first on the list for Voznesensky’s
future itinerary.
