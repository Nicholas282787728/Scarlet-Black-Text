Task Forces Consider
Student Power Moves

Three task forces dealing with
the case of the terminal contract of
Alan Nasser and the broader 15f
Sues of student power held an all
campus meeting Monday night to lnv
form the college community of the
work that they have done The meet»
ing, attended by fifty students, was
chaired by Clayton Lee.

Jenna Finch, whose task force has
been dealing with the problem of
educating the student body about the
Nasser case, presented her plan for
continuing that process, In the near
future hall parties Will take place
With a member of the Executive Co-
uncil and interested faculty mem-
bers meeting with the students to
discuss the case Prior to the
meeting material concerning the
case Will be distributed to slur
dents, A few students, including
former Student Coordinator Bob
Meyer, suggested that this plan was
not going to work since there was
such a Small attendance at this
meeting. Jeanna asked for constru-
ctive alternatives, but none were
suggested.

The task force on Educational Po—-
licy Committees reported that the.I
SGA’s program of raising the EPC’s
to legal ekistence is a good first
step. They suggested a follow,
up program that would give the
ECP's the right to question a deci-
sion of the ExecutiVe Council on
faculty firing.

The most radical of the proposals
suggested at the meeting was one

that would create a continuous
student voice on the Executive Co»

uncil, The task force which develr
oped this proposal was in continue
ous consultation with faculty meme
bers and feels that their proposal

is the most that can be rationally

Apphcaﬁons
Increase Here,

Mr. Nicholas Ryan, Dean of
Admissions and Financial Aid, an,
nonnced in an interview early this
week that approximately 1300 stu-
dents have applied for admission
for the 197273 academic year.
He was particularly pleased With
the number of applicants since it
represents an increase of 174 over
last year. The filial figure might be
even higher since the office is
still receivmg some late applicar
tions,

Mr. Ryan noted that the increase
in applications to Grinneil came in
a year when similar schools were
suffering decreases in applications.
Although he felt it was impossible to
determine exactly why Grinnell ap-
plications had increased, Mr. Ryan
prmected several hypotheses. Pros»
pective freshman were impressed by
the Grinnell ‘Frcshman Tutorial
Program, Last year’s decline in
female applicants was not repeated.
He also noted that some of the in-
crease is due to a rise in lowa, Ill-
inois, and New York State appli-
cants.

Mr, Maurice Hunt, head of the
Black Admissions Board, was
pleased by the response of black
applicants. As of early this week
101 blacks submitted applications
to the college. 47 of these students
have been accepted, and Mr. Hunt
expects about half to come.

Mr. l-lunt expects at least twenty
new black students to be on campus
next semester.

The proposal states that one woman

positions shall be filled by nine

have access to complete minutes of

Baha’i’s Communicate Faith

by Mike Turner

Some people may have noticed on
Saturday, April 3 a fair number of
people in small groups walking
around Grinnell, These were the
Bahai's's, the members at a cen»
tury old faith originating in iran,
teaching and pursuing the unifica-
tion and diversity of Man. Armed
with green invitations, they invited
people from campus and town to

hear a speaker, listen to a concert“

and partake in a Unity Feast,

The concert ofthe Children ofTime
was the main featured event, with
bright yellow and red posters on
campus and in the town. I talked
with Dan Tinen, a member of the
group who answered several queSr
lions I had about the group.

The Children of Time organized
themselves in September of [97].
Their leader is Warren Kime, fairs
ly well known in musical circles,
having cut two records under the
Command label, in one of which
he was assisted by DOC Severinsen,
Warren was leader, at this point,
of the Brass Impact Band. The
Children of Time is something difr
ferent, however, not only in pre»
sentation but in being motivated
beyond a desire to put out good
music. In last Saturday's concert
they attempted to communicate some
of the ideas of their faith. For every
member of the Children of Time
these concerts are a labour of love.
The Grinnell Baha'i Club managed
to obtain the Children of Time by
paying travel expenses with money
from the Cultural Initiative Fund.
They all have Jobs during the week
in the Chicago area and tour on
weekends The forces that brought
them together and to Grinnell are
their faith and their talent,

Another remarkable visitor was
Mrs, Ruhaniyyih Ruth Moffett, age
94, who spoke on “A New Race of
Man" in A.R.H Ruth has been a
Baha’i for over 55 years. She first
began investigating the faith as a
Sunday school teacher who wanted to
make sure she was teaching her
pupils the truth.

She and her husband, a newspaper
editor, later became respected his-
torians. Some people on campus may
have seen her Chart on the rise and
fall of civilizations which involved
some 20 years of research, She is
currently working on another book.
These visitors all expressed as
sentiaily the same reason for being
here last weekend, Ey telling people
about their belief and giving them a
chance to Study the principles and
practices of the followers of Baha'-
u’llah, the prophetsfounder of the

Baha'i faith, they hoped to make the
world a little more bearable

The Baha'i’s of Grinnell are very
pleased with the outcome of the
weekend. They feel that the diver-
sity of the Baha‘i's there (two came
from the Tonga lslaiids in the South
Pacific) and the evident unity the
Baha'i's had made an impression on
the campus and in the town This
unity with diversity was particularly
visible in the Children of Time who
ranged from Jr. High to middle agi-
and come from widely differing
social, economical, and cultural
backgrounds.

Walter Critic

A5 a response to the faculty’s re-
cent passing of the Grade/Erase
system, Anne Waiter, SGA Vice—
Presldent for academics, has writ-
ten faculty members her own views
on the needs and wants of most slur
dents in the way of evaluation

tier comments, advocating indi«
vidual written evaluations but no
grades, are outlined in the following
excerpts from her letter:

“The student body seems to have
two discrete discontents concerning
grades 1) the competitiveness of
grades and z) the meaninglessness
of grades. The first can be answered
by a change from letter grading to a
credit/evaluation System and the
latter by a change in faculty practie
ces and attitudes.

“There is a growtng group of slur
dents who find that the competitive
nature of grades inhibits learning in
that students are working primarily
for the grade and professors are
evaluating in terms of the grade For
the most part these people are not
dodging the issue of evaluation but
are asking that there be constructive
evaluation in the form oi Written
comments.

“Such an evaluation system can
only be effective ifa student calitake
all of his courses for "credit" and,
perferably, if all students were on
this system, I know the later concept
was rejected by the EPC from the
outset; however, l\vouId encourage
the faculty to take some stand and
send the Concept back to the EPC for
reconsideration,

“Grades are arbitrary but not abs
solutely meaningless unless they are
given in a meaningless way. Despite
n student's pleasure or relief in re-
ceiving a high grade in a course when
he was sure he was failing, he does
not respect this grade nor is be
satisfied with it when he does not
believe he deserves it. The disgust

One Grinnell Baha'i expressed it
this way, “Seeds have been planted
here in the hearts of the people on
campus and in the town. Some may
germinate immediately; others may
lie dormant; but all will have their
effect in time.”

is a followup to this weekend the
Grinnell Bahai’i's have arranged
for tircsidcs (informal discussions
for those who are curious or just
want to talk) to be held Monday and
Fr‘l’day nights at ii 00 in Steiner 27.
Baha'i’s regard it as their duty to
discuss their faith with any who
express interest.
