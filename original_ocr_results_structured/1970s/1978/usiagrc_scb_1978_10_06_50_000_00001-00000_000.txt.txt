Are tutorials working?

by Kathy Willlloilc

Although most students, laculty
and administrators are generally
satisfied with the current fresha
man tutorial program they note
weaknesses and question how
eiiectively the program is meeting
its goals

The controversy has resulted in
two recent changes in the
program, and discussion regarding
further change continues,

'l‘llE INCLUSION of Humanities
ltll courses as tutorials and a
change in the evaluation system
have been implemented this fall,

Currently tour proiessors are
teaching Humanities ml as their
tutorial topic, The proposal
allowing Humanities ml to be used
for freshman tutorials was
discussed extensively by the
Curriculum Committee and passed
by the iaculty last spring.

The faculty also voted to abolish
the creditserase evaluation
system. Tutorial students will now
receive the designation of
Distinction tcomparable to the 3.!)
to 4.0 range in a regularly graded
course), Passing (the 2,0 to 3.0
range). or No Credit tbelow 2 0).

THE OBJECTIVES oi the fresh-
man tutorial are to give special at
tention to Writing and Critical
reading. -oral presentations and
library research techniques as well
as to give freshmen a good first
experience at Grinneli and to
promote a ' close working
relationship between the student
and his adviser Dean Waldo

Recent rulings endanger press

by John Mandel

Recent decisions by lower courts
and the United States Supreme
Court continue to affect both the
rights and ireedoms oi newspapers
and consequently, all Americans.

The first case in the long chain,
and perhaps the one most relevant
to Grinnell students, concerns the
Zurcher vs. the Stanford Daily
battle It stemmed from a search
oi the paper's oiiices by local
police officials on April 9, 1971. The
search (allowed a riot in which a
group of demonstrators protesting
a janitor’s tiring occupied otiices
in the university hospital and ate
tacked and injured nine police
oiiicers who were in an adjacent
hallway,

AFTER THE DAILY published
photos of the incident, a judge
issued a warrant to search the
paper's offices because he felt
additional photos that would
identify the remaining assailants
would be iound there, The search,
however. revealed that all relevant
photos had been published.

The paper and its staff sub-
sequently iiled a suit charging that
its Constitutional rights——
speciiicaily those pertaining to the
first and fourth amendments—had
been violated. After the paper won
in lower courts the case reached
the high court which upheld the
constitutionality of the raid on May
31 of this year. The vote was Era-l.

THE PAPER CHARGED that
since there was no probable cause
to suspect anyone on the paper of
committing the crime. a warrant
should not have been issued.

Justice Bryon White, howeve '
contended that ”the ' Critical '

 

element in a reasonable search is
not that the owner of the property
is suspected of crime but that there
is reasonable cause to believe that
the speciiic ‘things‘ to be searched
for and Seized are located on the
property."

HOWEVER, JUSTICES Potter
Stewart and Thurgood Marshall
remarked that the Constitution
explicitly protects the freedom ol
the press. Justice John Paul
Stevens Warned of the serious
consequences for “countless law-
abiding citizens."

Other new decisions reﬂect a
growing tendency by the courts to
restrain certain media rights and
freedoms. In the Myron Faber
case, a New York Timcs reporter
refused to turn over his notes and
sources to the court and was
subsequently jailed. However, he
has been granted a stay by Stewart
until the Supreme Court hears his
appeal.

8&8 FACULTY adviser
William Deminolf sees difficulties
for the press and feels that it may
have to engage in a long period of
litigation until the composition of
the Supreme Court changes. He is
not optimistic about the short term
future tor the press. At present, he
thinks the Court is not necessarily
a conservative one, but is com-
posed of several “swing" votes
that could make the difference on
future decisions. History professor
Al Jones believes that the recent
verdicts are ”representative of a
new consciousness of both the
power and responsibilities of the
media.“

Publisher Al Hinder of the

Gririnell Herald-Registcr'does not' '

foresee any problems for his
paper. He cites a good relationship
with the Grinnell police force and
does not believe that all police will
use these new powers. obviously,
he is not happy with the decisions.

Walker calls the tutorial “the
keystone experience oi the fresh
man year "

The implementation of both the
tutorial and the Writing Lab
stemmed [mm a Concern about
writing atter the laculty voted to
drop all course requirements in the
[all of 1970. Previously all fresh-
men had been required to take
Humanities 101, but in the tail of
1971 the freshman tutorial became
the only requirement
ONE COMPLAINT about the
,tutorial program is the non
uniiormity oi the various tutorials

DIFFERENCES exist among
students and iaculty members
about the success oi the tutorials
writing component Sophomore
Claudia Ahrens asserts that her
history tutorial “improved my
writing and made me ieel better
about oral presentation" The
tutori' ”serves as an equivalent to
a writing seminar," according to
political science professor Wayne
Moyer,

Some students, however. per

ceive that the writing preparation
oiiered in their tutorials is lacking.

“We've had only three meetings,"

\
“I’m getting four credits

for very

little . . .

We should have more wor .”

oiiered Says one ireshman, “My
roommate has a lot of papers and
is always working hard. out I've
only read one book and done two
short papers.” Sophomore Tina
Grai asserts. “It‘s not iair to
assume students come out of the
tutorial learning how to write
better if all oi the tutorials don’t
have the same requirements ,,
walker additi nally comments,
"We're trying all the time to even
it up."

Walker says he would like to
experiment with the tutorial a bit,
perhaps making it a six~credit
course He would also like to at-
tempt to achieve ”a shared ex-
perience, a common body oi
knowledge for all ireshmen ” This
shared experience may involve
simply having all ireshmen read
the same book at the beginning oi
the year beiore moving into their
tutorial topics so that the classes
would have “something in common
academically,”

w

smiling?

says one ireshman. ”I'm getting

iour credits ior very little . . We
should have more work.” one
sophomore says about her tutorial,
“Not everybody in the class took it
seriously because the proi didn’t
take it seriously."

SINCE TUTORIALS are taught
by proiessors from every depart-
ment, there is a concern about in-

structmsoutsida nil , the. Egglir
department teaching composithin.
Senior Mark Sherinion believes,
”Most prois, although they can
write well themselves, have a hard
time communicating and teaching
those sorts oi skills to students."
Also, Professor oi Physics Beryl
Clotielter asserts, “Some teachers
don’t ieel coniident teaching
writing.”

A program of summer iaculty
writing seminars, which grew
directly out oitutorials, has proved
useiul to the iaculty. Developed by
English professors Donald lrving
