Strike a blow for liberal arts

column have ranged from
.“Soybeans and Women” (a topic
which I do not understand fully),
to the new fortress~like structures
in the Forum Grill. While I have a

few comments to make about the

latter, they would hardly fill a
whole column. One can only carry
the image of food-as»secret~
weapons (leaden bagels hitting an
empty stomach) so far,

I would like to address a topic
which has been plaguing me for

some time. It used to be phrased as

“What do you want to be when you
grow up?” For a while, it was not
at all evident that I was ever going
to stop growing up, so the question
became “What are you going to do
when you finish School?” “I don’t
know” was a satisfactory answer
for awhile, but the pressure for a

more definite answer has been

mounting lately.

THE pressure really began my
sophomore year, when I gave
campus tours for the Admissions
Office. As I guided pre-pre~med
prospectives around campus, their
parents invariably asked me what
I was going to do when l graduated.
Smug in the assumption that their
daughterson-thedoctor would be
secure in her—his profession, they
eyed me curiously and wondered
what an English major could do.

(My parenm are also fond of that

question.) That question, as well as
“How many hours a week do you
study?" were ones mat I had to
answer with my usual articulate
ex lanation. ”I have no idea."
on’t misunderstand me; I did
come up with an answer. My

Suggested topics ior my first

roommate, who came in for
questioning when I showed
pruspectives my room, was also
tired oi being asked what she
planned to do with her life.
Together, we decided that she and
I were, respectively, pie-squirrel
and pre—piaho key. I just lacked
sufficient courage to say that to
anyone,

IT SEEMS ridiculous to ask a
sophomore what they plan to do
when they graduate, but more
reasonable to ask a junior or
senior. Now, no matter where i go,
the question confronts me. Even
my beginning French book, as I
learn the future tense, asks me
what I plan to do next year. I no
longer have a ready answer. My
roommate and l have given up the
squirrelepiano key idea, on the
supposition that we would have
trouble with union membership.
My hopes of becoming a pirate
were dashed when I found that I
was rotten at fencing. Now what'!

I have spent much time mis year
seeking advice. My advisor an-
swered the cosmic question ”What
can i do with my life?” by pointing
out that I wouldn't starve. (Ask a
silly question . . .) The problem lies
not in finding a job, but in finding a
career. My father suggested that
big money can be found in owning a
skateboard park. Idon’t know why
I talk to him, anyway.

THE CAREER Services Office
seemed the logical place to look for
guidance. I enrolled in a Career-
Life Planning Workshop. Un-
fortunately, I could only attend the

 

first meeting. While it was a worth-
while workshop, it was at a poor

“Other end” and forum gr1ll b1te

In today’s column it
is my honor to present this
week’s “Being Bit by the Hand that
Feeds You“ award. Well gang, it's
a toss up between Dave McConnell
and the management of Pagliai’s
Pizza. Need I say that McConnell
will receive the award for the
special effects in his new
production of “Forum Grill ’78?”

It was reported by McConnell, in
the 5&8 last year, that his
production of “Forum Grill’77”
would lose a total of $13,000. Well, it
appears that Dave’s a shoein to
top those figures this year. You
knowI I was thinking. that if Dave
took all that junk back out from
behind the counter, and let people
get their own food, how much could
the rip-offs amount to in two
semesters? If we managed to
snitch $50.00 worth of yogurt,

whatever it‘s called. had a dress
code. “Yes, we do,” she replied.
We asked her if she could tell us
what it was, and she said it was up
to her discretion. We pressed on.
asking if individuals in blue jeans
would be admitted. “No,” she
answered. “Then why did you just
admit that couple wearing blue
jeans?” I retorted, expecting her
to reel from the blow. “It de-
pends." she casually replied.
Deciding that further questioning
would prove fruitless. we ex-
plained to the hostess how much
change to give us, and proceeded
on our merry way, never, I can

time in the semester. Flunking my
classes would have meant a
postponement of the whole career
question indefinitely. However, I
do treasure the lovely purples
crayon rendition of my most
significant achievement which I
did during the first workshop.
This drawing came in handy
when I applied to law schools over
brelk. (No, I didn’t xerox it and
send it in with my applications.
You can’t be too Careful what you
photocopy with the new copyright
laws.) I had not beer. aware of any
significant achievements until I
took the workshop. When law
schools asked me what I viewed as
my most significant ac»
complishment, I was ready. “After
i wrote War and Peace and before I
built the Brooklyn Bridge, I un-
dertook to establish what I View as
my most significant achievement:
world peace.” This may not sound
significant to you, but remember,
you have to start somewhere.
MY decision ‘to apply to law
school exemplifies one way to
answer “What are you going to do
when you finish school?” i.e.,
never finish school. This is the easy
way out, and, for that reason, I
would like to prove to myself that I
can find a job, If any of you have
parents who are in a position to
hire people, they can write to me in
care oi the college. I will be
available to start work June 1; my
skills include typing. duck
imitations, and making sketches in
purple crayon. Spread the word,
and strike a blow for the liberal

 

arts education.

assure you, to return.

I OFTEN hear of such treatment
of Grinnell ,students concerning
their dress habits, not to mention
some inconsistencies in Pagliai‘s
check accepting policies. It does
appear that the management of
Pagliai's has forgotten just how
instrumental Grinnell College
students have been in the
development of their business And
so, the “Being Bit by the Hand that
Feeds You" award goes out to
what I fondly refer to as “The
Other End” because “The Omar
End” is obviously where the
management’s heads are at!

Open space

by Howard Weissman

There is a popular myth
prevailing upon this campus that
the functions of its S.A.’s are
merely to collect money for floor
activities, distribute
guestionaires and make popcorn.
This myth is perpetuated each
year by a small percentage of
irresponsible, selﬁsh S.A.’s who
shirk matters of possible
significance, devote all their time
to other endeavors and develop a
laissez faire attitude towards their
floor that eventually renders them
ineffective.

The Student Advisor program
should not be understated. In
addi on to serving as a facilitator
and initiator for developing a sense
of community on the floor and
serving as a mediator and
spokesperson when an individual’s
rights are violated, S.A.‘s are in a
unique position to identify potential
problems and either approach
them directly, or recommend
referr in cases beyond their
capab ties. If we are to be aware
of and appreciate the value of
preventive methods, the S.A, s
invaluable.

It must be noted that nowhere in
the job description or expectations
of Student Advisors does it specify
counseling as a responsibi ty, We
are not trained as counselors and
the goal of the program is not to
build ”amateur psychologists.”
Nevertheless, it is not unheard of
for an SA. to find himeherself face
to face with an extreme and
serious emotional crisis, for
depression, frustration and anxiety
ar not unusual to this campu
Or is intervention is a rarely d
cussed, yet real component of the

rposition.

 

 

 

 

Responsible students
needed for SA job

Because 3 A.’s are not given any
compensation, a Student Advisor
tiring of his position can stop
functioning without fear of
reprimandiyou can't fire
someone from a nonsjob, so the
incompetent S,A., fearless of the
consequences, can cease to be an
active leader on the floor and
ignore the seemingly minor (which
often become major) problems.

Where does the solution lie? Not
in awarding compensation; there
simply is not enough money to be
had, and other forms of reward
such as academic credit are not in
the immediate future. The solution
must lie in the crop of applicants
for next years’ S.A.’S. The
program needs internally
motivated, caring individuals with
a sense of humor and a side of
humanitarianism—people who
know, and like. people.

The words “Student Advisor"
written on a door never fail to alter
a new student’s perception of who
lives behind it. Whether you like it
or not, other people infer from your
title that you are in a position of
responsibility. You are looked to as
a model for acceptable behavior,
and sought as an advisor, confidant
and, above all, friend. To make the
SA. program completely sound it
must be composed of students who
will be cognizant or their perceived
role on their floor.

In order to achieve this, one
factor stands alone: there must be
many qualified applicants.

There cannot be an effective
selection procedure if _there ar_e
only one and onelhalf app ants
for every one position. There are
too many of you who have the
ability and the desire to care who
do not apply, The stigma of the
popcorn»making, incompetent S.A. .
can only be changed through an
increase in the quantity and
quality of the applicant pool.

Applications are available now,
and more information can be
obtained through your RA, 3A. or
Janet Carl in Student Affairs.
Please think of applying ii you feel
you could do a good job. The
personal rewards, self-growth and
interpersonal gains reaped by the
position more than make up for the
time.
