The Scarlet 5: Black. February 24, 1M8Tpage 4

Must work inside and

outside the system

Remember the night of February 17'] Remember the
confrontation in the Grill?

Both the activist students and the representatives of the
administration left that night agreed and satisfied on one
point: that student concern had been aroused, and that this
would lead to positive and effective student participation, at
least in the matter of the Forum Grill structures Decisions
would be made, and this time, made with the involvement of
students.

We find it disconcerting, therefore, that not one student
showed up at the next Food Service sub-committee meeting,

or any of the subsequent meetings, to offer suggestions or
complaints. If student concern had been aroused that night,

it appeared to have relaxed into its usual slumberous state
the following day.

OR DID IT? Perhaps the issue of the Grill structures was
just too petty for most people to be personally concerned.
Judging from the large turnout at the original gathering,
however, that would appear not to be the case. Perhaps the
new black paint on the structures' walls settled the matter in
most people's minds. But the structures were not the only
topics of controversy; and none of the other issues brought
up at the open forum has been followed through .»

Perhaps the reason students did not accept McConnell's
open invitation for further discussion was not apathy or
laziness, but rather a continuing resistance to go through
administrative channels to achieve change, the result of a
firm belief held by many that the one and only way to get
things done is to work outside the system.

WE DISAGREE. Students firmly committed to change
should be willing to explore all means of bringing it about,
This includes both working within the system and operating
from the outside. Staging a protest can be an exciting and
useful catalyst, but the long-run test of commitment, and the
sure indication that apathy and laziness are not the
prevailing attitudes on this campus, is a willingness to
become involved with the practical matters necessary to
bring about change.

New KDIC special
programs a treat

Perhaps you’ve noticed that for the past couple of weeks
we have been running the KDIC special programming
schedule alongside the weekly movie reviews on page six.

We've been running them not. to fill up space, as has been
slanderously rumored, but because we think it's important
the campus community he made aware of this wonderfully
diverse selection of well-produced radio features

KDIC HAS come a long way just in the past five years—
from a ﬂy-by-night rock station with very little decent
equipment and an amateurish staff to the smooth running,
well programmed station it is today, featuring not only a full
spectrum of music—from punk rock to classical—but of-
fering, as well, its excellent weekly selection of special
programs.

As the result of a tightening of FCC policy last year,
forcing small, ten watt educational stations to devote more
time to “community affairs,” KDIC began to offer more
special programming It might have gone the route most
commercial stations take: burying its special programming
(often consisting of taped agriculture reports and religious
shows] at bizarre hours in order to fulfill its special
programming obligation.

INSTEAD, KDIC went out and got quality programs,
from Pacifica, from the U. of Chicago and from other sources.
And instead of hiding them at 6 am. on Sunday morning,
they're scheduled in prime time.

Now, virtually any evening one can tune in and hear,
depending upon the night of the week, short features on the
latest scientific developments, a special show devoted to
black programming, or the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, to
name but a few, It seems to us that few students realize what
a luxury they haveand to reach it they need go only as far as,
their radio.

Praises Schultz; laments sexist attitudes

To the editor: Girls must be girls,
but college women can be equal. »
Unfortunately, Mr. Schultz’s
description of the “mating game"
succinctly characterizes the
situation in Grinnelliwhich is
indicative of the whole society.
Women face the perplexing
situation where forwardnoss is
considered too agressive and
unwomanrlike.

Men's perception of women must
change. However, for this to occur
women must assert themselves in
social situations if they ever hope
to gain true equality.

The timidness of women has
prevented relationships, including
platonic, from developing.
Females must usually wait for the
“first move" (which could be no
more than striking up a con- l
versation), while the male, tor-
mented with insecurity. must deal
with whether or not he will be
positively received.

On occasion, me woman’s only
recourse is to drop subtle hints of
interest while the male cautiously
(out of fear of rejection) searches

Refutes Winick

To the edi r: [disagree with Russ
Winick's statement in last week’s
5&3, that “a monumental
generation gap” has developed
between the student of iiveten
years ago and today’s unr
dergraduate. ' ‘

Grinnell students tend to be
complacent about their com-
fortable position in society. But
how much less complacent,
ultimately, are yesterday’s
students? Look around at them
loday; they are in business, in law
school, in transit. Not so different
from the rest of us, If yesterday's
students had lost their com-
placency, perhaps they would not
have allowed their movement to .
fall apart and die. ,

As Mr. Winick notes. we no
longer have the Vietnam War as a
focus for dissent. The political,
social, and economic climate of
America has changed since 1963,
Students and others cannot make
changesin the society solely by the
methods used then. We should
neither continue to judge ourselves
nor to allow ourselves to be judged
by the standards of ten years past,
Lynn Hertz

 

for these signs. In the end, either
the male “sticks out his neck" by
making the»“first move," or the
two parties never become
acquainted due to their inhibitions.

The latter result is most up
setting. If women would be more
assertive, then this behavior would
become accepted and more

relationships would occur wi
minimized periods of uncertaint

Finally, I wish to Commend Mr.
Schultz for airing an issue alluding
to the traditional and antiquated
sex roles which dominate this
college community and olﬁ
society. Denny Minami

Anarchists offer solutions

To the editor: We have read the

disputes about the SGA in these

pages with some alarm and, as
socially conscious students of this
institution, we feel dutyvbound to
put forward what may be a

.solution. x
The idea is simple. We merely_

use our resources in the best
possible way. If SGA wants to
discuss weighty issues, let it do so.
Free it from the piddling details
that keep it earthbound.

To take care of issues SGA
considers minor, 3 Committee for
Bureaucracy and Fiscal Details
(CBFD) can be created to transfer
these duties from the SGA to the
CBFD, but these details will be
outlined in a later publication. the
CBFD would not be concerned
with changing the constitution,
creating sub-committees or any of
the other things the SGA loves so

much and does so well (if slowly,

To further this end we can
rename the SGA the SGC (Student
Government Club), and offer to
each person who wins an election
two credits per semester. (Faili‘
to be elected would be considered a
grade of “no credit.”) This will
provide students won a Lremen~
dous opportunity for practical
political education and give
student body a forum where
representatives can debate Hie
truly (7) weighty issues.

These two changes should help
make SGA function as a body for
social change once again, If h
representatives would expend the
same effort reaching decisions that
they now expend in opposing each
other, the student body will be well
served. D.A.M. (Democratic
Anarchist Minority? .
