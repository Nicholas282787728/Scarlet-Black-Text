The Scarlet 5i Black, February 17, IMO—page 4

 

Any great ideas?

So you thought the whole question of student involvement
in faculty evaluations died last year? So did everyone else . . .
except the Executive Council, They revived it at this past
Monday’s faculty meeting. And this time it was the faculty,
not the student body that wasﬁdoing the arguing.

While the faculty eventually rejected the Council's
proposal to change the present system of student evaluation
of faculty performance to a system based on mandatory end-
ofvcourse evaluations, the vote was close—and those who
comprised the majority could hardly have been considered a
homogeneous body.

SOME VOTED against the new evaluation system
because it would have led to increased dependence upon
statistical data in promotion and tenure decisionsl Some
voted against the proposal in order to avoid changing the
procedure for faculty evaluations for the second time in four
years. Some voted against the proposal simply on the
principle that students should not be involved in faculty
evaluations. Some voted against it because they saw
more weaknesses in the new proposal than in the old
system. And some voted against the proposal apparently
just to vote against the administration. Needless to say, real
trends are hard to distinguish in Monday's vote.

The Council’s proposal had its merits. Faculty evaluations
ought to be conducted more often than simply when a
professor comes up for promotion, contract renewal or
tenure. Surely most professors would benefit from such
constructive evaluations—certainly all junior faculty
members would. How could professors not benefit from
knowing how their students view their teaching procedures,

especially prior to being formally evaluated for contract or
tenure consideration?

DEAN WALKER spoke the truth when he stated that the
present system of evaluation is ”ﬂawed." It is. Students are
often interviewed for a course they took three years ago.
Memories are short; memories are vague. Inconclusive
interviews result.

And while not as debilitating a flaw as many faculty
members claimed, the 40 responses required under the
present system is a rather small sampling, especially when
you consider that those 40 students could conceivably be
selected from 21 different sections and courses taught by a
faculty member over the past three and a half years. The
broader sampling provided for in the proposed evaluation
system would have been an improvement

BUT THE proposed system had at least one major flaw
as well, The only way of collating more than 9000 forms a
year is in statistical form. There‘s no way around it. And we
must agree with the sentiment expressed at the meeting
and in the SGA letter to the faculty: statistical information,
while valuable, is not complete and cannot adequately

replace the sort of information gained through personal
interviews with students

SO WHERE does all this leave us? Pragmatically, it
leaves us back where we started—with our present system of
evaluation, howsoever flawed. Yet Monday’s meeting proved
that many improvements are needed in the present
evaluation system, and many are workable, too. Just
because the faculty rejected this proposal doesn't mean that
it won't consider another, perhaps more feasible one.

Meanwhile we all have to live with the flaws, Instead of

letting the issue die, perhaps the Executive Council should
try again,

Tuesday’s child has lame excuse

You would think by now that I
.would have enough sense to stay
away from athletics. It has been
obvious from my early school days
that whoever said, “Tuesday's
Child is full of grace” lied. Then,
too, it's bad enough to be falling off
the balance beam onto your
spotter, but when the last name
“BEST" is Stenciled across the
back of your gym suit, you begin to
think that fate is not on your side,
I can swim rather well, Since I
was forced to learn how at the age
of two, Dad used to make me stand
on his shoulders and dive off into
Lake Michigan, At this late date, I
wonder if he had a death wish for
me. Anyway, I survived, and
eventually swam on my high
school’s water ballet team.

FOR THOSE of you who may not
know, water ballet is a deservedly
obscure art form also known as
synchronized swimming. People
swim and do stunts in unison,
usually to a musical ac-
companiment. My all-time favorite
routine was one in which we
swam to “The Skater's Waltz."
We weren't just swimming, we
were trying to look as lliough we
were skating while swimming.
This was not an easy iask.

One year, the theme of our show
was “Time," and the title of the
show was “Chronologicus
Aquarius." The finale had all Sixty
Aquetles in it. We made a ﬂoating
hourglass, while some people
swam through the hourglass being
sand Then we made a giant clock
face, while some people swam
around being the little and big
hands. I'd give more details, but I
seem to have partially blocked
them from my memory.

THE BEST thing about Lhis'

finale was that everyone was
wearing their team suits and7

white gloves. As we moved into our
formations, a black light was
turned on, so the audience could
see the beautiful spectacle of sixty
pairs of purple hands forming an
hourglass.

Lest you think that Grinnell is
above this sort of thing, let me
inform you that there was a water
ballet club at Grinnell untll 1974.
The name oi the group was the
“White Caps,” but I have been
unable to find out anything else
about it, It's probably better that
way '

/\ friend drove me over to the
hospital, and we asked at the in-
- formation desk where the»
emergency room was. The nurse
on duty told us to follow the little
red dots on the floor. Yes. folks, I
thought I was following a trail of
blood, but the red dots turned out to
be stickers. They unnerved me
anyway, and I had to stifle an urge
to sit down in the waiting room,
read an article entitled “Mao and
Me" in a back issue of Ladies
Home Journal, and forget about
the knee.

You are what you eat

To the Editor: It takes time to
protest, even more time if it's done
thoughtfully. With that in mind, I
ﬁnd it promising that at least some
students are interested enough to
”challenge FOG." OK, so the Grill
renovation isn't a piece of prize
architecture, band like to suggest
that there’s a more important

aspect of the food service to be
concerned about.

Our cafeteria food for the most
part reflects the common
American diet, I don’t think I have
to belabor the point that this is the
same diet that is producing
numerous types of cancers. heart
disease, and various other kinds of
physical as well as psychological
ailments.

FOG food is loaded with
