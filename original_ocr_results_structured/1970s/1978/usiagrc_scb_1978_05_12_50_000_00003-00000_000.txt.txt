traditional music adapting it to
modern times, and adding a social
cummitmentto the struggles of the
exploited masses oi the continent.

DURING the late sixties and
early seventies, many groups
emerged loliowing the example set
by great lolklorists like Violeta
Parra, Victor Jara, Wuilapayun,
Intislllimani and others. Amincha
emerged during the early 70‘s in
Chile, as a group oi students
dedicated to learn from that
mu5lcal movement. As some at its

became reorganized in the United
States and is presently engaged in
a program of internal training and
development.

The name Amincha comes
from a small town located In the

culture, including the music the
ensemble cultivates
