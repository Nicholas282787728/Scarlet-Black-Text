Applaud library vote,

This week, the voters of Grinnell overwhelmingly ap-
proved a $390,000 bond issue that will provide funds for
needed renovations and improvements to Stewart Library.
As with all bond issues, an approval rate of at least 60 per
cent was required for passage. In case you haven’t heard,
Tuesday's margin of approval was a phenomenal 85 per
centisurprising for a town which has traditionally met bond
issues, at least in recent memory, with less than enthusiastic
support.

As a result of the bond proposal's passage, one of Grin-
nell's most historically and architecturally significant
buildings will be preserved; and one of the town's most
extensively used buildings will be modernized and repaired
All for a reasonable cost, one which the city of Grinnell can
easily afford. Of course this is a good step. Yet for members
of the Grinnell College community, Tuesday's election is
doubly significant, for a pleasing trend may possibly be
emerging—one that bodes well for the future of the college as
well as the town,

JUST last year, voters in the Grinnell-Newburg School
District approved a new major school bond issue. It was
close. The bond issue passed the required 60 per cent mark
with only six votes to spare; and it was the first school bond
issue passed in Grinnell in 17 years Yet the fact that it
finally passed, coupled with the fact that Tuesday‘s library
bond issue was approved by such an overwhelming margin,
may well be indicative of a renewed willingness on the part of
the community to once again work towards improving and
upgrading its educational facilities.

The college can only benefit from this atmosphere of
renewed concern for education within the community. In
recent years, it has become increasingly more difficult for the
college to attract a sufficient number of young, qualified
applicants for lower level administrative and teaching
positions. Not only has competition for such candidates been
stiff, but the turn over rate among young professors and
administrators who have come to Grinnell has been
despairingly high. One reason continually cited for this was
the reluctance of qualified applicants and newly hired
professors .to_ / ise their children in a town so openly
opposed to improving its educational facilities
Clearly Grinnell did not appear as an attractive place to raise
a family Even as recent as two years ago, a number of
faculty members had expressed reservations about
remaining in Grinnell due to the lack of a commitment to
quality education by the community. Some, like Charles
Seller, former dean of records and off-campus study, even felt
they had to leave the college for the sake of their children’s
education. Now with a new high school being built and
funds for renovation of Stewart Library on the way, such an
era has hopefully passed on forever.

IT IS clear that without making a strong commitment to
the maintenance and funding of educational facilities,
Grinnell will never be able to attract the bright, young,
concerned couples it needs for the future, and the college,
too, will find it difficult to attract and retain the young
professors and administrators it needs.

Perhaps this latest election is indicative of the passing of
the primitive attitudes toward education that afflicted
Gl’innell during the past decade. We certainly hope so. And,
we applaud the voters of Grinnellistudents, faculty, and
townspeople#for their good judgment in Tuesday's vote.

Grinnell fascists plan coup

One Wednesday night last
semester I had occasion to attend
an SGA Joint Boards meeting. The
issue of SGA funding for the Kent
State protest was being discussed,
and Green Bobburg of the Grinnell
College Republicans was speaking
against it with his customary
passionate eloquence. If this
political group is voted SGA funds.
he promised, then the Young
Republicans themselves would
come before the Joint Boards and
ask for money. At this point a
fellow Republican, Ed Gregward.
whispered Iiercely to Bobberg to
be quiet and eventually persuaded
him to do so, At that time I won-
dered why so steadfast and stirring
a defense of the Republican cause
should merit a kick in the shins by
a comrade, but now I know that

‘Bcbberg was warned to be quiet
because he was perilously close to
revealing the covert plan of the
Grinnell College Republicans to
take over the campus.

Yes, the Young Monarchists (for
that is in fact their secret identity;
notice how they ignore you or
protest when they are addressed
by that title) have for some time
been plotting a counr
terrevolutionary terrorist coup in
take control of Grinnell. The
Monarchisls‘ coup, fiendishlv and
cleverly planned, is tn be funded
by the campus CIA station chief
(an unkown political science
professor) and actually carried out
by special agents of the Poweshiek
County branch of SAVAK, the Shah
of Iran's secret police. By exposing
the details of the coup and ex-
plaining the motives behind it, I
hope to give freedom-loving
Grinnellians enough torcwarnmg
to crush the subversive Monar»
chists’ threat and thwart the
planned assassination of hundreds
of people on the SVAK hit list.

AS ANY Monarchlst will tell you,
their organization has always been
concerned about the leftward
leanings of Grinnell faculty and

 

students and the dangers they pose
to the American way of life. What
they will not tell you is that the
outcry over Kent State. South
Africa, and Affirmative Action so
convinced the Monarchists’ Royal
Court of the immediacy of the
Communist-inspired danger that
the Monarchists decided to
abandon peaceful political action
in favor of more effective subs
version and terrorism.

The open appearance of the
Revolutionary Communist Youth
Brigade on campus and the app
propriation of son lunds for the
alternative newspaper of the
Organization for Student Action
proved to be the last straw for the
Young Monarchists. To them it
seemed that the poison of commie
doctrine and the decay of moral
and ethical standards were so
widespread in Grinnell that the
entire educational purpose and
structure of the college and the
composition of the student body
would have to be drastically and
irreversibly altered.

T0 TIIIS end the Monarchists
obtained the CIA funds (which
were laundered through a dummy
corporation known as the Grinn-
Dell) and enlisted the aid of
SAVAK by informing them that
hlasphemies against the Shah and
innuendoes about his sexual
practices were being uttered all
over campus and scribbled on the
walls of Burling bathrooms.

The topsecret timetable of the
coup calls tor Bobburg lwho holds
the title of High Privy Councillor in
the Royal Court) to ask the SGA for
money tor the College Republicans
to send a delegation to help the
South African government in its
fight for freedom and justice At
the expected refusal of this
request, a squad of SAVAK agents
\vtll burst into ARH ii and murder
the entire SGA cabinet and two-
thirds of the hall reps with ex
ploding copies of Robert‘s Rules of
Order furnished by the CIA. At the

 

same time SAVAK camel patrols
will engage in searchrand-destroy
missions against drug freaks,
homosexuals, feminists, minority
groups, armchair liberals, and
other undesirables.

ONCE the campus is made safe
for 100 per cent Americanism,
Gregward will present to die
remainder of the college comr
munity the Monarchists’ White
Paper on the future of the College.
The reforms suggested in the
White Paper will include
restrictions which would limit
admissions to applicants whose
ancestors owned slaves or fought
for the British in the Revolution-
ary War; a common required
curriculum which would feature
the writings of Caligula, Louis
XIV. Barry Goldwater, and Idi
Amin: a degree in neutron bomb
technology; Ronald Reagan
movies every weekend; and an
Iranian Cultural Week, Off»
campus programs would feature a
semester in Panama defending the
canal against tinhurn dictators and
commie mobs m case the giveaway
treaty goes through. B&G workers
would be dressed in livery and
ordered to wait on students hand
and foot.

The Monarchists insidious plan
goes on and on, setting lorth in
meticulous detail the sinister in-
tentions of this infamous group, but
I will not stun the reader with
further horror stories We must do
something about these Monan
chists now, before itis too late! The
coup was slated for February 8, but
now that I have discovered it they
