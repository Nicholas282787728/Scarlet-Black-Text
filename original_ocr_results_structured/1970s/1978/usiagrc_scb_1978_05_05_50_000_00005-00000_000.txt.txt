One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
was the single mostrrequested iilm

deservedly so. In 1976, amid stiff
competition. the film was the first
production in 42 years to sweep all
the major Academy Awards, in
eluding Best Picture. Best
Director. Best Actor and Actress.
and Best Screen Adaptation,

Ken Kesey's novel of the same
name embodied the spirit of the
sixties. the decade of the non-

were popular successes, But these
films had a common flaw—they
depended upon a onedimensional,
unrealistic View of the world that
was often too Sentimental and
cutesy to be convincing, The smash

based on the popular fantasy that

The beauty of One Flew over the

avoids that type of speculative
sentimentality, There is a
dramatic and affecting conflict
with wide-reaching implications
between a lrce spirit and a society
which cannot contain him. The
nature of the free spirit is not
fabricated but exists particularly
in comparison to the ill and abused
people around him, The rigid.

Where are the philosophers ?

by Robert Van Nostrand

While I was home over spring
break I was asked an interesting
question: “Who are the in-
tellectuals present day college
students are listening to?" The
more I thought about it the more
puzzling it became.

Ispentthe past few weeks asking
my fellow Grinnellians this
question, and I noticed a general
pattern The first reaction was a
blank stare, then a nervous laugh. I
tried to make the question as broad
as possible, including authors,
artists, or a favorite bartender, I
was ready to take anything. Then,
as they thought some more, a few
names began to arise. Camus,
Sartre, and Eiseley were
suggested. Someone did suggest
the executive board of IBM, but I
prefer to think that he was joking.
Sylvia Plath was the only woman
mentioned, and no one outside of
the US, or Western Europe was
brought up. I found it peculiar that
the one thing these intellectuals
had in common was that most are
dead. I did find one intellectual
who is very much alive and was
universally acclaimed, Gary
Trudeau, Now I like Doonesbury
too, but Zonker Harris is hardly a
light unto all the nations; at best he
is a well ground mirror.

The conversations I had after
this question revolved around why
prominent, relevant thinkers are
so hard to come by, Some have said
that there are none. A quick trip
through the bookstore, the stacks
or the magazines in the library
shows that this simply is not true.
A talk with a professor will get you
more books than you can carry
home.

IT'stcmpting to say that it’s just
a horse and water problem, but It is
more than that. One fellow said
that he had given up thinking,
because “bar-hopping is so much
easier,” Others have said that they
are too busy with class work to
think about the world. There is
little that I can suggest to my bar-
hopping friend, but I can't un-

derstand the rest of us who see

little if any connection between the
world and our study. What appears
to be going on is what Angela Davis
spoke about: we put things in little
boxes and tuck them away in
dusty archives. Not only the
American Revolution, but E equals
mc squared as well.

Another line of reasoning we use
IS that the world’s problems are too
complex; we cannot possibly come
up with solutions, The world‘s
problems are indeed complex, but
I see a few problems in ignoring
them. First and foremost is that
they don't go away: we are going to
have to live with them or solve
them somehow. Second, someone,
sooner or later, is going to try to
solve society‘s problems, but they
do not always use the most ef-
fective or humane means. Real
live Nazis are marching in the city
that held the 1968 Democratic
convention, I can't think of them as
a current political or physical
threat, but they are presenting
solutions and Americans are
listening. I iind it singularly un-
settling that such movements as
the Nazis and other obscenely
intolerant groups are the growing
edge of American society. ‘.

THE ANSWERS or at least the
road to some answeis to the
complex problems we face,are not
going to be found by one individual.
Even ’if one person did come up
with all the right answers, we
would have to be sensitive enough
to see them,

The first step has got to be
making the problems oi the world
something we really talk about.
This dialogue has got to confront
the complexities of the issues. For

on what eilccis a generator like

a breeder reactor really gets going
the issues become moral and
ethical. All of a sudden these
irrelevant poets, philosophers. and
social critics we study are giving
more answers than the engineers.
Allola sudden physics and English
majors have more than enough to
talk about.

THIS IS one of the more concrete
examples, but it does Show an
interesting situation we now face.
The technological solutions have
been, lor the most part. found, the
only question that remains is our
Own moral resolve, This was the
message at the Appropriate
Technology Fair, and this was
what Angela Davis was saying.

It appears that we are reaching a
watershed in the progress of our
society. Where the emerging world
civilization goes depends on where
we push it. The increasing in-
terrelatedness of all problems
makes every field ofstudy relevant
and a dialogue between our own
special interesLs crucial. These
interrelated problems are being
addressed by some, and it strikes
me as one of the most exciting
things happening in the world
today.

IT IS also clear that those who
are giving viable alternatives for
the future are intellectuals who are
not necessarily male, living in the
First World, or dead, I would think
that we would welcome this state of
affairs and Share in the excitement
that is rocking most of the world.
Issues that have plagued men since
the beginning are being attacked
with new resolve and vigor. An
understanding and dialogue about
this dynamic can make Grinnell

Supremacy myth lives

Many whites consciously and
unconsciously Still believe in white
supremacy. They believe their
religion tChristianityi and their
technological advances are
symbols of their supremacy White
supremacy is a horrible lie and any
Afro-American that has lived with
whites or has taken a small look at
history knows this to be true.

Whites have tried to “save" nou-
whites all over the world by
pushing Christianity on them.
Everywhere white Christian
missionaries went, exploitation
followed. They went to Africa and
exploitation followed; they went to
China and exploitation followed;

'they came to America and ex
ploitation of Indians followed,

IN addition to forcing
Christianity on nonwhites, whites
have also tried to convince people
of color that Jesus was white.
From his research, Malcolm X
discovered that Jesus had to be a
black skinned man. In his auto~
biography he points out, " . .I
never have met any intelligent
white man who would try to insist
that Jesus was while." The
teaching of Christianity Shouldn‘t
be condemned, but whites using
Christianity to bolster white
supremacy should be condemned.

Whites like to point to their
technological advances as
demonstrating their supremacy.
Whites have nothing to be proud of
because whatever they have was
made possible through the abuse of
non-whites. Even the white that
studies hard in school and then
goes out Into the world and makes
his fortune has nothing to be proud
of. The money that was available
:to build those schools was largely

lithe result of the cheap labor non:

. whites provided and the resources

 

from the homelands of nonwhites.
White South Africans are sick
enough to believe that their
”superior Intellect" is responsible
for their thriving economy, just as
many whites all over the world
believe that what they have, they
earned honestly.

t\FR(I~l\mcricaus have received
the largest dosage of the white
supremacy myth because they
were, and still are to a large ex
tent, cut offfrom their own history,
The brothers and sisters that do
just a little research into their
Alrican heritage quickly begin
to realize the extent whites have
lied to them They discover that
Africa had powerful kingdoms with
highly sophisticated cultures
without the presence oi whites.
The black students that don't
research their heritage, but attend
predominately white schools make
the same realization, They
discover that whites, on the whole,
can‘t think, talk, walk, or do
anything better than they can. ll
every black person in this country
was placed in a predominately
white environment for a year, tho
myth of white supremacy would be
permanently removed train their
minds. 7

The myth of white supremacy is
one of the maior reasons why
whites and non-whites are at
conflict in this country. The belief
in white supremacy allows the
dumbest, poorest White to feel he is
in some way better than an equally
poor and dumb nonwhite, If the
white supremacy lie is eliminated
then maybe the disadvantaged
whites in this country can join
hands with the disadvantaged nons
whites, as . Angela. Davis .
suggests. and work together to
bring about changes for all.
