Law bans
paraquat spraying

President Carterlastmonth approved a measure that effectively
bans the use of Us. funding for paraquat spraying of marijuana
fields in Mexico, reports a recent press release from the National
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), The
provisions Concerning paraquat and other dangerous herbicides
were included in an amendment to the Security Assistance AOL

The amendment, however, states that the ban will no longer
apply if methods can be devised and implemented to warn the
consumer that the marijuana is contaminated. State Department
consultants have concluded that their efforts to color contaminated
pot by using a red dye in paraquathave been unsuccessful,

Until a method of spraying is found that somehow “clearly and
readily" warns the user that the pot is Contaminated, further U.S.
funding is no longer legally possible.

Sexuality workshop reviewed

hyJeffMeisles

“Masturbation can be fun,"
according to the Broadway
musical Hair. This and other topics
were discussed in detail in the fifth
annual human sexuality workshop
last weekend.

The workshop provided an op-
portunity for students to explore
their own sexuality, as well as to
learn how their peers feel about the
subject.

THE WORKSHOP began Friday
nightas the participants listened to
the recording of George Carlin’s
monologue about the seven words
which can never be said on
television. Next, HA,'S presented
a skit dealing with two people who
had a hallrhearted sexual ens
counter. The group of to people
then split up into five smaller
groups, in which students
discussed their upbringing and
how this affected their sexual
mores,

Probably the most, interesting
exercise of the weekend was the
“fishbowl exercise," which took
place Saturday. Groups of about 20
people split up into male and
female subgroups, where pare
ticipanls devised a list of every
question they ever wanted to ask a
member of the opposite sex,
Questions ranged from how people
feel about oral sex to the im-
portance of penis size to what
people do to turn on members of
the opposite sex The male and
female subgroups then rejoined
and exchanged their lists of
questions. The males then an
swered the females' questions and
vice versa.

THE PURPOSE of these and
other exercises was to encourage
students to explore their own
sexuality and to think about things
which may never have Crossed
their minds.

In general, the workshop was
considered a great success by both

facilitators and participants.
Stuart DresCher, one of the course
leaders, was “impressed that the
workshop attracted students with
such a wide variety of sexual
backgrounds and experiences.”

students written evaluations of

the workshop indicated their
satisfaction of it. Also, as KAr Ann
Claflin pointed out, the fact “that
so many people were willing to
commit as much time as they did”
showed mat there was a genuine
interest on the part of the students,

Center is one of many support
systems the college has provided
for survival.

Although he doesn't think
there is one palt'lcular problem
common to students, he notes that
most are markedly anxious and
depressed. He speaks of several
common concerns and sources of
stress, the most prominent one
being the pressure of Grinnell's
academic situation. “It seems to
me that the pressure is greater
with increased competition for
graduate schools; students have
become more serious and preoo
cupied with academics than a few
years ago.” He believes that
students tend to be “unsatlsfied
with their performance, and
dissatisfied with themselves.”

BECK AND YOUNG believe that
studean' misperceptions of the
world and the pressures that
surround them are just as imv
portant in causing problems as the
actual stress. They believe
students tend to “inflate the imr
parlance of temporary setbacks
and misjudge the severity of
rejections." For example, one
medlocre grade can lead to the
deep felt fear of success in the
future.

The article in psychology Today
also points out the potential for
misperceptions is much higher for
students since “they experience
simultaneously all the transitions
that are the major stresses in
adulthood: all at once, they lose
family, friends and familiar
surroundings, with college sup-
plying no ready made sub-
stitutions."

Seniors and freshman constitute
the majority of students who at-
tend the Center, possibly because
these are the studens who are

 

suffering the effects of transition
the most

OTHER MAJOR reasons people
come to the Center are in-
terpersonal concerns, such as
relationships with the opposite sex
(or lack thereof). Also relation—
ships with parents distress some
students, due to their sudden in
dependence and strong feelings of
obligation and high expectations.

Common feelings like fears and
phobias can he treated at the
center. “I had some phobias that
bothered me through high school
that weren't very serious such as
claustrophobia and fear of ﬂying.
My therapist taught me how to
relax, how not to worry so much
about things. It helped to defeat
problems. before they start,"
relates one student.

IN TREATING students, Dr.
Daniels calls their approach very
“eclectic, using no one theoretical
approach. We just use whatever
seems helpful."ln initial sessions,
he feels trust must occur between
the therapist and the client. He
stresses that studenu must be
assured that the college has no
access to their records “All
records are confidential and a
signed release is needed for anyone
to acquire them,"

The Center, a private, non
profit corporation, offers live free
sessions to students yearly in
accordance with a contract with
the college. Appointments by
phone are taken for an hour session
with either Dr. Daniels or Susan
Schrader.

In addition to these two clinical
psychologists, there are two other
staff members. Kathy Jay, a social
worker for the clinic, rarely sees
studean because she lives in
Younker Hall with her husband,
Mike Jay, the rmident adviser, and

 

feels “it would make students
uncomfortable.” Psychiatrist
Mary Kohl, who is there for five
hours a week, sees only a few
students, either for evaluation or to
prescribe medication.

In therapy. according to Daniels.
a student is “listened to, accepted,
encouraged and supported," He
feels most of therapy is “exploring
and working to find solutions.
students lose sight of options, feel
hopeless and helpless which leads
to anxiety and deprasion."

REFLECTING ON the therapy
for her chronic depression one
student says “in order for therapy
to help you have to be willing to
change. I had to get out of
problems and habits that caused
my depression. Some of it also
involved altering my attitudes
about life."

A student who has» been to
therapy for depression noted that
she sees many studenm who “don't
deal with their depression th
should." ‘3.

THE AUTHORS or the “College
Blues” article point out, “despite
the amount of depression around
them however, depressed students
often perceive themselves to be
alone." They also observe in
current studies of four unnamed
universities, that studean have
trouble evaluating the seriousness
of their problems and whether‘
professional help is warranted.

One student who has attended
the Center tor a year now sees a
reluctance'to attend the Center
because “the idea is very
widespread that you should be able
to help yourself, which is very
unfortunate. There is no rule that
you can't ask other people for help,
Knowing where to get help is
