Aerobic dance: an eye opener

by Lorri thmniin

llave you thought about your

cardiovascular system lately“! At

3:15 in the morning7 It you have,

you must be eiuier a jogger or an
aerobic dancer,

The latter isn't an insult or even
as intergalactic as it sounds.
Aerobic dance is a type of iazz
dance based on the same healthy
principle as jogging, that is to
maintain an accelerated pulse rate
iabout double the average pulse
rate at rest) for a sustained period

of time (15 to 20 minutesi it this is

four times a \veekiyour pulse rate

even non-prermeds know. a lower
pulse rate means your heart isn't
working as hard and that your
body is iunctiomng more el-

Tennis season closes

by Sarah Brichford

The ACM tennis tournament held
the spotlight at Grinnell last
weekend. Grinnell placed lourth
behind Carleton, Ripon and
Lawrence In a field of ten teams

Number one player Paula
Banchy sprained her ankle in
practice on the eve ol‘ the big meet.
“It was really a bummer. rm a
senior and that's it for me," said
Banchy. ”Fate dealt us another
bad blow.” All season the Pioneers
were plagued by illness, bad
weather and injury,

Freshman Sara Mathews
replaced Banchy in the ﬁrst spot
during Friday’s singles action. She
was eliminated in early play.
Claire Gill won the singles in the
number two slott Sheila Adenwalla
lost in the finals to place second in
the third ﬂight action. Nina Cers

folio, number four, won the cons
solation match for third place.
Number five Melissa Sobalavarro
and number six LuAnne Shearer
both lost in their final matches for
second place finishes.

in Saturday doubles action
Cerfolio and Gill. in the number
one spot, won their consolation
match tor third place. sobalavarro
and Shearer, number two, and
Mathews and Adenwalla, number
three. nere eliminated early.

“They really did well, but I think
we could have come in second."
Said senior Banchy. “We didn't
fulfill our potential this season."
Indeed. the tennis season ter~
ininated last weekend. Due to a
scheduling oversight, the Pioneers
had no chance to demonstrate their
prowess at the state meet, which
was held last weekend at the same
time as the ACM meet

Some of the dances are
reminiscent of the cha~cha or the
Charleston Although all the
dancers per-term the same routine.
there's room for individual style or
pace. The movements can be
periormed at slow or brisk paces,
and dancers are free to modily the
routines or go off and create lheir
own.

The aerobic dancers. led by Babe
Voertman, meet Monday, Wed
iiesday and Friday in the Dance
Studio in Fine Arts tyes, at 8:

students. faculty, start, male and
female, in sweatsuits and
leotards. Voertman and Leslie
Czechowski. both of the theatre
department. worked out the
routines which are found in books
on the Subject, Aerobic dance
records provide the music and the
dances that are done are
choreographed to get the ideal
aerobic Workout.

Ms. Voertman. who teaches
all the modern dance classes and
leads the Dance Troupe tand is
presently directing the play
“Solitaire"), points out that
aerobics is both ”pleasurable and
beneficial.” Given the sedentary
habits of many students and
academic people. Voertman and
Czechowski thought that a class
like this would be helpful and
healthful. Like jogging, aerobic
dance conditions the heart and
exercises the muscles but it seems
to be a lot more fun,

Aerobic dancer Elissa Barnett
attends the class frequently
because she has trouble getting
started in the morning She says it
makes you feel goodi‘ﬂt gets your
blood circulating." What‘s clear is
that aerobic dance is doing some
good [or the people who get down
there early enough to participate.
