It’s World Series time again
Baseball fever heats up campus fans

by Danny Kaddcn
This year more fans paid to see
major league baseball than at any
other time. Many Grinnellians
across the nation actively sup-
ported their favorite teams during
the summer. but had to painfully

TV lounges across campus, as
insults and threats were thrown
back and forth between the two
.sides, After the Yankees took the
game, Boston lans felt immense
anger and frustration as their
team's season came to a disap»

tear themselves away from home
in order to return to school some
six weeks ago.

Returning to the obscure cornr
fields has been difficult for many
baseball fans, but the resourceful
ones have found ways to keep track
of their teams: by piecing together
spotty reports in the Des Moincs
Register. catching scores on [<ch
newscasts, watching moronic
sportscasters on TV, and hearing
Dad's reports via longrdistance
telephone, lans somehow followed
their team's progress during the
crucial month of September.

ALTHOUGH THE season has
officially ended for most teams and
their fans, baseball fever is Still
with us here at Grinnell and W|ll
certainly remain until the World
Series is decided.

With students from almost every
state in the union, Grinnell is now
seeing deep regional baseball
conflicts developing; city rivalries
exist despite the distance from
home. The recent Boston Red Sox-
New York Yankees special playoff
game saw ugly scenes develop in

[1' IS A well-known fact that
these new belligerent Yankee:
haters will do practically anything
to see the Yanks go down in total,
debasing deteat. This feeling of
rank vengeance is a universal
characteristic of “the losers" that
surfaces at the end of every
season. (If your team is beaten out
by another at the end of the season,
it‘s only natural that you direct

your frustrations at the winners.)

The only thing worse than
“loser‘s vengeance” is “winner's
gloating." The disgusting tendency
of winners to tease and torment the
losers appears here in its worst
lorm. All propriety is thrown tothe
wind as the winners take ad
vantage of their superior firing
position and let fly with the put
downs. It is certainly one of human
nature’s worst moments.

OF COURSE, TIIE majority of
teams spend the season groveling
tor respectability in the vicinity of
fourth place in their respective
divisions. if any hostility shows up
here, it's miniscule compared to
that of Contenders or nearswinners.
The only strong feeling expressed
by these fans is one of non-violent
envy, naturally directed against

‘the team that has finished first.

(Case in point: Chicago Cub fans
have been doing this for 33 straight
seasons.t For the pitiable fans of
these teams, October; means it's
time to tune in to the football
season.

So beware, reader! As you pass
by TV lounges during the next two
weeks. look out for flying bottles
and stray knives. Violence will
undoubtedly abound as Kansas
City, New York, Philadelphia and
Los Angeles fans settle down to
fight it out, While the fans of the
close losers (Pittsburgh, San
Francisco, Cincinnati, California
and Boston peoplel join in the
rhubarb. May the most obnoxious
fans win!
