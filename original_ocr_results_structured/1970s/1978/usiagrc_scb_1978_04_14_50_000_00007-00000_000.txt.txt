but encounter the agony of defeat Saturday

by Disco and Red

Peter St. Thomas, Grinnell's resident Irishman,
led the Grunts, Grinnell's townegown rugby squad,
to an exciting 1942 victory over Wartburg College in
the spring season's opener.

Demonstrating the Skill of foot which has earned
him widespread acclaim as the Pub: dancing
waiter, Pete St. Disco scored fifteen points with a
superlative run for try, two penalty conversions,
and the Sweetest. luckiest drop kick in the history of
the game.

'The game was characteristically American,
bone-bruismg contact compensating for ineXr
perience, Don Pctrich and Ken O’Barski, Pioneer
iootball standouts, intimidated the Wartburg for-
ward pack with their vicious hitting and presence.
Howard McDonough, Grinnells fine loose prop,
provided the,game’s most exciting play with a
bullish forty meter charge against Wartburg's
strong but surprised defense.

POOR ﬁeld conditions and a slippery ball ham-
pered Grinnell's running attack, Jeff Greenberg
and Dave Seeberger produced several brilliant
defensive plays, with Greenberg also setting up St.
Thomas’s first half try.

Doug Brower, one oi Grinnell's three players
(Brewer, Tom Hawbaker, St. Thomasl with in-
ternational rugby experience, exploited Wartburg’s
lnaccurate kicking attack with slashing returns and

 

tryesaving kicks for touch (kicking the ball out of
bounds).

Tom Hawbaker, the Grunts' scrumhali, supplied
Grinnell's iinal tally, putting the game out at reach
witha jarring 10-yard driveinto the end zone.

THE ci-iiiits ran up against stiffer conpetition on
Sunday, losing a wellrfought contest to the UNI
Panthers. 22-18, Joe Melinger and Kent
Christiansen led the ruggers with a try apiece
Christiansen was so thrilled that his exuberance led
to late tackles and his subsequent dismissal,
proving thatrugby remains a rufflari‘s game played
by gentlemen,

Except for a iew back~breaking penalties, the
ruggers played well against an experienced and
wellrfed UNI team, which included several starters
from the Panther varsity grid squad UNI
illustrated novel defensive tactics, including the
head butting against Tom “What's that gentle
rapping on my skull!" Hawbaker

There was really no outstanding individual play
Sunday. A balanced attack combined with fine team
eiiort accounted for the surprising display.

THE team has four remaining matches before the
All-Iowa Tournament at lTom) Mason City. Ex-
perience coupled with tenacity should produce a
successful tour, g

After this weekend's matches against Des Moines
and Upper lowa. the ruggers will be collecting their
dead and heading fur the Pub, where. with ancient
rugby incantations and miraculous brews, they will
resurrect their Valiant comrades.

stymied by the breeze, committing
six errors, whilethe “swatters”
were held at bay, getting only three
hits off,‘ the Simpson f‘Duck

Best ball

by iinbcrt Meyer

Grinnell finished a disappointing
sixth place in their “Best Ball"
tournament, which was held at
Oakland Acres last weekend
Coach Edd Bowers had hoped that
his men's golf team would finish
third in the eight team field

Leading the Grinnell golfers as
he has tor the past three years. was
Mike Hopkins. The team of
Hopkins and Doug Cmeiik carded a
strong 73. Dave Vanderpool,
another threeryear veteran,
teamed with Dave Harmon, and
they finished with a score of 74.

The third pair, composed of
Steve Moyer and Fred McDougal,
compiled a score of 83. Although
McDougal’s performance wasn't
up to par, Coach Bowers expects
him and VanderDDDl to threaten
Hopkins for the top spot in the
lineup. -

Softball defeated by the field

by Ann Chassoii

The Grinnell women’s softball
team opened their season at home
last Friday afternoon with two
games against Cornell. Final
scores were 2010 and 15—3, with
Cornell sweeping the
doubleheader,

in the first game, Cornell had
scored ten runs in the top of the
first when it was discovered that
the pitcher's mound was in
correctly placed. Pitcher Sarah
Brichford had been pitching from
six feet farther back than the
regulation distance The error Was
Corrected before Grinnell came to
bat in the bottom of the inning,
where they remained scoreless,
The errorrplagued deiense con
tributed to the ten run inning.

Even with four runs in both the
second and the third innings, the
women could not catch up to their
opponents. and the game ended at
20710 in the fifth inning because of
the “lenrl'un rule,” The ”ten-run
rule" terminates any game alter

five innings if a team leads by ten
or more runs.

Coach Winkler remarked that
she was pleased with the team‘s
performance in the second game.
Eight runs were scored on fifteen
hits, and the team's fielding was
more consistent. The game was
called because of darkness after
three innings.

The games scheduled for last
Saturday were rained out. The Coe
game was played at home
yesterday. and the Marycrest
game will be rescheduled for later
in the season.

Enthusiasm on the team ls high,
Third baseman Gretchen 'h‘ekell
enthused, “It’s been a lot of fun so
far!” Led by experienced
sophomora and talented fresh
men, the women's team is looking
forward to a successful season.

Tomorrow the team has a
rematch with Cornell at Mt.
Vernon. Their next home game will
be this Friday at 4 pm. against
Graceland
