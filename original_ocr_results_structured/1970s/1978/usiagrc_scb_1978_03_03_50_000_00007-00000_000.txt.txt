Wrestlers from all corners of the Midwest jour-
neyed to Darby Gymnasium last Saturday for the
Midwest Conference wrestling meet.

At the meet’s end many probably wished Miey had
smyed at home as Coe College wrestlers bruised
their opponents and easily won the tournament by
scoring firsts in six weight classes and seconds in
the remaining four weight classes.

Coe’s dominance in wrestling is nothing new.
They have now won the last four conference
championships. Because of this fact, the annual
MWC wrestling meets are beginning to be dubbed
the “Coe College vs. conference all stars" meets

Coe’s dominance, however. is a relatively recent
occurrence, Over the past forty years Cornell has
won over eighty per cent of the MWC cham-
pionships. Today Cornell still has an extremely
strong wrestling program and their exploits of last
weekend included four firsw and two seconds.

Stacey, Greenwald score points

Grinnell finished eighth and won all their team
points from the efforts of cocaptains David
Greenwald (118) and Gordon Stacey (IM). Stacey
finished third in his weight class, earning 71/4 team
points and Greenwald placed fourth, earning 4%
points. >

Greenwald won his first match easily but was

quickly pinned in his second match by Cornell's
Karl Reindel. Reindel finished second in the weight
class. Later Greenwald wrestled for the consolation
finals and walloped his opponent 26%. in the con-
solation finals Greenwald was defeated 10-1 by his
Knox opponent.

Stacey. like Greenwald, won his filst match but
lost his second. In his second match Stacey laced
Lawrence's outstanding wrestler. Tom Meyer, and
lost by the score of 11H. After this defeat Stacey won
his remaining two matches to place third in his
weight division.

Grinnell wrestling in retrospect

After watching this meet one can arrive at two

’ conclusions: 1) Iowa is the home of top-notch

wrestling and 2) Grinnell College is not responsible
for Iowa’s success in wrestling, In the past nine
years Grinnell has compiled a 9994 record and
seven of those victories occurred in the "15776 and
'75-’77 seasons. , .

Grinnell wrestling this year never got oil on a
strong footing. The team could not fill all ten weight
classes and in the conference meet Grinnell only
represented seven weight classes. Coach Stephan
Moss does. however, have something to look for
ward twthe team’s talent is maturing and no one
on the team will be lost because of graduation.

Grinnell drew a tie for first place
with William Penn in last Friday's
indoor track meet in the PEC.
Cornell College was third in the
triangular meet. the last ol.the
regular season for conference-
bound Grinnell, ,

Tony Whitaker again sparkled
for the Pioneers, capturing vic-
tories in both the long jump and the
triple jump. Whitaker leaped 20‘

the two events,

Grinnell finished {-2 in the Shot
put. Pete Blonsky taking first with

timistic about Grinnell’s chances
to place in the upper division.
Pfitsch thinks the athletes he is
taking to Chicago will all be con
tenders for points in the meet.

Whitaker and Mike Borns supply
Grinnell with power in the field
events, as do the steadily im-
proving Blonsky and Kearney.
Gilbert, Kevin Key, and Roger
Sayre provide the Pioneers with
speed - in the distance events.
Unfortunately, Drew, last season’s
top cross country/«runner, has been
unable to get back in the groove
and will not travel to the Windy
City withlthe Pioneers.

The Grinnell women’s basketball
team finished their season last

shots consistently, and compiled a
commanding lead in the third
quarter.

far cry from the year before that,
when Grinnell barely managed to
fieldpa team.

Coach Winkler reﬂected, “The
highlight of this past season was
the dual win against Luther and
Coe. The team felt and looked like
a winning hall club. The players
had realized their potential and
had achieved it.”

But. [the improvement in this
team's season did not come
without hard Work. The returning
sophomores from last year formed
the team's care, while freshmen
also made a significant con-
tribution.

Winkler looks to next year
Without the usual overoptimism of
most Grinnell coaches. “Next
year‘s team record shall improve
With the formation of a women’s
Midwest Conference for basket-
ball. We'll be able to compete on
our own amateur level of play,"

she stated.
