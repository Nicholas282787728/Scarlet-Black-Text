Male cagers prepare for season

by Paul Schwartz

with the (all sports season
coming to a close, Pioneers have
once more begun to {lock to the
basketball courts in preparation
for the upcoming season.

Coach Arthur Peterson comr
menced practice on October 25,
allowing the team one month to
ready itself far i3 scheduled
opening at the william Penn
Tournament in Oskaloosa over
Thanksgiving weekend.

This year's team is a senior
oriented ball club which includes
nine players lrom last year's
opening squad. Cuach Peterson
hopes to avoid the trlctron ot last
year’s team by holding regularly
scheduled team meetings. The
reeling among the players is a
much more relaxed une, he states.

“WE'RE ALL working‘tt) have
tun, but everyone out there wants
to play basketball,“ comments co-
captain Matt Miller, “We've got a
lot of guys back, which will help us
a lot. We play a lot or teams with
scholarship players and noteam's
really been hurt by graduation, so
all the teams will be strong. We’re
shooting [or a ,500 season."

will serve as
assistant coach. He returns to
Grinnell today after spending the
last year teaching basketball and
working in Australia.

IN PREPARING for ‘the up-
coming season, Peterson has been
stressing a team-oriented offense
which emplays much ball handling
and maneuvering on the court. “If
we can excel oilensively like I
hope,” he notes, “We’ll have four,
hopefully five, guys with double
figures."

He plans to rotate seven players
in the live starting posttions:
seniors Roger Warner. cocaptain,
Miller, Frank Orth, Roy Shepard,
Billy Knox. Charlie Gogel and
sophomore Pat Walsh, while
maintaining an active bench led
by Peter Nierman, Paul Sutton and
Pete Walker,

GRINNELL llAS not received
much plaudit for its defensive
game in recent years, but Peterson
hopes to solidity this aspect of the
team’s play by employing a
multiple -system matching -zone
deiense, in which the defense

maintains a free-moving structure
around center and the players
continue to switch coverage on
Opponents:

ln contemplating the likelihood
of the Pioneers enjoying a lairly
succaslul season, Coach Peterson
continues to stress the importance
of team play. “Our success is to be
keyed by hovy well we play asta
team, It these guys really come
together and become real team
players, we've an excellent chance
of reaching our .500 season goal,”
