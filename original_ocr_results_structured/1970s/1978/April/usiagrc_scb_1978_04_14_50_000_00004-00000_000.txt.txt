The Scarlet 8! Black, April 14, 1975—page 4

It’s the season for AA r“

Spring is characterized by a number of things here. It’s the
time for sunbathing, stereos on the loggia and the Relays.
Spring is also the time when the college does most of its
faculty hiring for the next year.

BY NOW, almost all departments are well under way in
their process of interviewing and selecting candidates. And
by the number of colloquia held during the past two weeks, a
fair number of candidates are already being brought to
campus for final consideration.

All the more reason to readdress the issue of affirmative
action. As this week’s article on affirmative action points
out, AA is far from a dead issue here The college's stated
commitment towards achieving a sexually balanced faculty
has begun implementation, for indeed, the college has made
favorable progress in that area. >

THE PROBLEM IS in attracting qualified minority
applicants Because of a number of factors, most notably
Grinnell's rural location and its negligible minority com-
munity, not to mention the relatively small pool of potential
applicants and the relatively high nation-wide demand for
them, Grinnell has a miserable record of attracting and
keeping minority professors. This semester there are only
three minority faculty members on campus.

What can be done'.7 In the short term, probably Very little.
The college is not going to hire a large number of minority
professors all at once, Not only are we unable to compete
with the larger state schools in terms of salaries, we must
face the fact thatGrinnell is simply not a terribly attractive
place to a black, say, or a Latin who desires close contact
with a group with whom he or she feels a cultural aff‘nity.

IT WILL BE much more of an incremental p' cess.
Minorities will not come in droves, they will be hired singly.
a few at’ a time. And hopefully the college will be
able to retain them. If we are ever to achieve the culturally
diverse faculty we desire, the administration, the various
academic departments and the student EPC members must
all work together towards this goal. We urge then, par-
ticularly now while many positions are in the process of
being filled, to acknowledge and uphold the college's pledge
to support affirmative action.

We want letters

How come we never get any letters anymore? This isn't
strictly true, of course, but the dearth of student letters has

become particularly noticeable as of late.

Whatever happened to all those vociferous letterrwriters
on campus'.7 Is there nothing to write about, or have they
disappeared? Or is it something else?

WE SENSE a growing passivity among students: that is,
a distinct unwillingness on the part of the student body to
become involved or to assert opinions Students seem to be

(operating on autopilot these days.

One of the primary functions of the S&B is to serve as a
forum for members of the campus to express themselves on
issues that concern them. Is the current lack of letters in-
dicative of a lack of concern? We hope not.

WE WANT more letters. In order to properly fulfill our
role as a medium for lively, meaningful discussion, we need
the cooperation of our readers.

Each dorm and all sludcnts

cases [he representative voles his

constituents.

A prime example of this is the
attempt to remove the four at
large student members of lhe CSL,
Very few representatives held hall
meetings or sought hall opinion
before Wednesday’s meeting. It
seems as if the Joint Board at»

its callous and pompous disregard
for student sensibilities. The
Grinnell College Suntan Club, a
