Dick Myers, the expected
Democratic nominee for Iowa's
first Congressional District who
spoke here last Friday, approaches
the campaign issues from a blue-
collar, populist political orien-
tation.

Myers is a self-made man from a
blue-collar background. He
currently owns a large truck stop
in Curalville. His outlook reflects
this background. On labor, for
example, he favors labor law
revision and the minimum wage,
but opposes the closed shop.

He believes his background
qualifies him for Congress.

“CONGRESS is such an elitist
organization that it makes me sick.
One of the reasons I'm running for
this position is that l, frankly, do
not come from the financial and
social elite of this country. I don't
believe there are very many people
like me in Congress. Nevertheless.
I am not poor, and if i couldn't run
for this position I Wouldn’t, I think
that's an indictment of the job
itself." .

Three of the issues he has
stressed heavily are the need for a
National Health Insurance
program, federal chartering of
multinational corporations, and
federal aid allocation criteria that

community.

THE public health program he
sees as essential in light of the high
costof premiums and the existence
of 12 million Americans who are
not covered under any plan.

chartering multinationals, he
feels, would be a first step toward
re-establishing tree»enterprise
economics in this country

Gadﬂy takes ; off

by Eric Berry

The Organization for Student
Action’s monthly newspaper, Tile
Gndfly, will make its debut ap-
pearance this coming Tuesday.

The paper's focus will be
political opinion, concerning both
college and national issues. It will
concentrate on the college's ins
vestments in South African
companies, affirmative action, and

 

 

minority admissions, immediate

issues which are related to larger
national and international affairs.

THE GADFLY will also respond
to both administration and SGA
policy, and address the questions
of student participation through
EPC's and the position of minority
and gay students within the
campus community,

Rhonda West, one of the
organizers of The Gadfly, said that
the newspaper has no editorial

hierarchy. and that its staff will
consist of all OSA members who

wish to work on the paper The

x Ghallenges incumbent Leach
Popuhst Myers campa1gns

Myers claims his upcoming
campaign will be issuedooriented,
and will offer the voters a well-
defined choice.

”You’d like to think we’ve got
free enterprise. I think that once
you get outside the local gas
station, (free enterprise) is largely
a myth we seem to like to per-
petuate in this country. Large

multinational corporations have -

too much control over the
economy, too many tax ad
vantages. There ought to be
federal chartering,” he said,

MYERS also sees a relationship
between the economic power of the
multinationals and price levels.

“The policies of multi-national
corporations are particularly
important in their effect on prices,
especially, those of grain, and thus
are directly related to our
economy," he added.

In addition to chartering
multinationals, Myers also wants
to initiate legislation that would
help small farmers survive. To
accomplish this goal, he wants to
reform the method of community
aid distribution, which is scaled
largely on population.

MYERS seems to stand a fair
chance of winning the campaign.
He has several advantages that
may counteract Rep. Jim Leach’s
incumbency. One is the financial
and organizational support of
public interest and union lobbyists
who have seen their proposals
largely defused or rejected over
the last year by Congress and have
redirected their efforts to the
districtlevel

GREGG Edwards, a member at
the Grinnell College Republicans,

students working on the forth-
coming issue, Carrie James,
Lisa Mayse, Ross Johnson, Andy
Preston, Jeannie Dixon, Tom
Kiel'er, and Scott Wolfe, constitute
what West called the editorial
steering committee, which will
determine the paper's content.

THE PAPER will print any
article submitted by a student
unless there is substantial op-
position wlthin the OSA mem»
bership to its publication Articles
which are rejected may be printed
as letters to the paper's editorial
board if the author wishes. The
lirst issue will contain an editorial
policy willch will define the Views
and purpose oi the OSA.

OSA ls concerned with raising
the political consciousness of the
Grinnell Student body. WolIe
stated, “i personally would like
Grinnell not to be a white, upper
class institution," While he
believed the school was doing all it
could with respect to minority
admissions. he would like to see
more students with working class
backgrounds admitted.

 

Candidate Dick Myers

feels that, despite Myer's promise
to run an issue-oriented campaign,
there is little difference on the
issues between him and Leach.

“1 got a very positive impression
of his sincerity and desire for the
job, but there‘s no significant
difference between him and Leach.
Like Leach, he's for the agency
shop, and any further differences
on labor are unimportant shadings.
I think the main issue will be
personality and that Myers will
very subtly emphasize the dif-
ferences between their
backgrounds. But he's got to give
the public a good reason to turn out
Leach, which is why I think
Leach has a better chance as an
incumbent:"

WEST SAID that OSA desired to
work with the SGA and added that
she desired a more responsive and
powerful student government. She
complained that the SGA was
inefﬁcient and cited the semester
elections as an example,

“The lack of student par-
ticipation in the SGA elections was
due to the lack of publicity. in my
own dorm (Clark), only four people
attended and two of them were
elected,“ she said.

However. Gadlly staff member
Torn Kiefcr had kinder words for
SGA President Neiderbach

“Jon does the best job he can
under difficult circumstances. He
is more progressive, but hindered
by the system," he said.

West stated that the Gudily is not
a rival of the 8&8, since its ems
phasis will be on opinion rather
than news reporting. “However.”
she said. “i think our editorial
Stands will diifer."

The Gadrly is funded by $125
from SGA and $150 from the
Initiative Fund.
