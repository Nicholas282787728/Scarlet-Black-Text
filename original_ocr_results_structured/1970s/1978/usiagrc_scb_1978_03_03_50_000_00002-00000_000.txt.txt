Arena Theatre
set vandalized

The Flanagan Arena Theatre set for this weekend’s theatre
department production The women of Troy was vandalized last

weekend. Flanagan Arena Theatre is located in the Fine Arts
Center.

According to at theetreédepartment spokesperson, the damage
was relatively minor. Assessing the damage, she said, “Someone
further smashed the ruins of Roy.”

The destruction took place sometime after the building was
closed Friday night following an open rehearsal and before the
building was opened early Saturday morning. Grinnell police were
not notified of the incident. A full crew worked five hours to repair
the damaged set in time for Saturday‘s open rehearsal,

The theatre department as yet has no information concerning
the destruction. In recent months the Fine Arts Center has been the
target of numerous acts of vandalism, the most serious being the
destruction of three drawings in the Fine Art Center’s Scheaffer
Gallery last October. The drawings were by Alex McKibbin and
valued at $100 each.

New boycott policy accepted

SGA Joint Boards voted 15-7-1 to
accept a new boycott policy
proposal, authored by Jim Stuart,
at last Wednesday‘s SGA meeting,

A week earlier, Joint Boards
rejected 10—12 a boycott policy '
proposed by the Committee on
Student Life (CSL).

The accepted proposal mandates
that the Food Service will boycott
completely any toad item if 60 per
cent of the students vote, in a
referendum, to boycott. If 204%] per
cent of the students vote to boycott.
the Food Service will partially
boycott the food item,

The proposal provides for two
separate referendums. One will be
'for all board students. to determine
the Food Service's cafeteria
policy. In the other referendum all
students will be eligible to vote to
detenwline the Forum Grill boycott
policy.

According to Stuart‘s proposal, a
referendum to boycott a particular
food item will be held if Joint
Boards votes for one or if 50
students petition the SGA Election
Board for a referendum.

The accepted plan states that the
Food Service will provide alter

native foods . for the boycotted
items providing “the cost is not too
prohibitive,"

Also, it 20-60 per cent of the
students voting wish to boycott a
food item, the Food Service will
decrease its expenditures on the
boycotted item by the percentage
of students Voting to boycott.

The accepted boycott policy now
goes to the CSL for their approval.
If it is approved, as expected, it
will be sent to President A.
Richard 'nirner for final approval,
which is also expected.

Howard Simons, managing
editor of the Washington Post, will
deliver a journalism lecture in

attention in 1973 when he was
served with a subpoena for

 

testimony and notes on the Post‘s
coverage of the inquiry into the

the Post at this time were for the.
