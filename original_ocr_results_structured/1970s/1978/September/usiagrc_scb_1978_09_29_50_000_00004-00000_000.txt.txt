Keep alcohol issue

in proper perspective

A bad law has been passed, and we must live with it.

The new drinking age law has necessitated a total change
in the college's alcohol policy, and has produced a totally
divisive reaction on campus. The administration wants to
protect the college from civil or criminal liability, and the
students Want to ensure that the unique character of
Grinnell's social functions somehow be preserved. At this
point, it looks to many as if those two aims are in conﬂict
with each otheri ,

SO WHAT'S TO BE DONE? This is not an easy question
to answer. Colleges all over Iowa are grappling with the
problem, and no one as yet seems to have come up with the
perfect solution.

There are some things that should be kept in mind as we
try to find our way out of this dilemma. First of all, obvious
as it may sound, let's attempt to find a rational solution, and
as simple a solution as possible. Complicated, convoluted
schemes for trying to get around the law will only result in
confusion and deceit, and leave everybody dissatisfied.

ON THE OTHER HAND, we must explore all the
alternatives. Many people have offered possible solutions,
Ideas coming from both the administration and the students
should be weighed seriously for their feasibility. Certainly
the college must protect itself, but this does not mean that
the administration should go overboard by adopting the
most severe policy that is suggested.

In the end, the question rests with President Turner. The
policy proposed by CSL and the one that the Joint Board will
come up with at its next meeting will be placed before him
ior the final decision. We urge that he consider both
proposals carefully before reaching that decision. In the past,
when conﬂicts between CSL and Joint Board proposals have
arisen. Turner has invariably opted for the CSL plan. This in
turn has increased student dissatisfaction by leaving many
with the feeling that the representative body of the

studentsisGA—has not been given due consideration.
IT IS CONCEIVABLE that Joint Board will reach the

same conclusion as CSL—that no SGA funds can be used for
alcohol. If so, the fate of the James Gang Bang, Loose Hall
Ball, and Grinnell Relays may not be decided for some
time. Hopefully, these allccampus events will be able to
retain their character. It’s hard to imagine a dry Urinnell
Relays.

In any case, we must not blow this situation out of
proportion. The administration should not succumb to
paranoia when analyzing the legal ramifications of the law,
and the students should not get hysterical about the
possibility of a radical change in campus policy. In many
states, the drinking age has been 19 for quite some time, and
both students and administration seem to operate under
such a burden with relatively little problem. This can be the
case for Grinnell, too. ‘

Letters to the editor

Verbal abuse of athletic opponents is inexcusable

To the editor: At recent athletic
events on campus I have had the
displeasure or listening to the
verbal harassment oi visiting
teams by Grinnell students.
. i watched a recent ﬁeld hockey
game while listening to racxal slurs
and u mixture oi other abuse and
llavcwitncssed a near fight when a
member oi an opposing lootball
team took oiicnsc, surprisingly
enough, at derogatory remarks
said virtually to in: (ace l don't
believe that these kind of actions
do anything good inr Grinnell and i
don't think they are necessary.
Grinnell has long been noted lor

uniqueness in its athletic attitude
because of the emphasxs that
“academics come first," and the
perhaps much greater degree of
this emphasis than at many other
schools, When this is added to the
[act that many of the schools
Grinnell competes against are
very different in their altitudes
outSIde of athletics. this leads to
the situation where the attitudes
and practices of opposing teams
often seem ridiculous to us.

I don‘t see anything wrong with

having some ion with these more
traditional attitudes. but I don't
believe that it says much tor the

Redwood siding scandal—part two.

To the editor: Iiwe can't save the
redwoods. we should at least try to
save the redwood siding on the
library addition to the science
building, Thanks to Steve Hall [or
llls letter in last week's SRB ex,
pressing outrage at the
Catastrophe. i“D0n’t paint the
sciences brown." Sept. 22.l

l was in the local planning mill
“hen the siding was being
fabricatedibeauliiul redwood to
see and smell and feel So much so
that I asked Bob, the college
carpenter, to save the scraps tor
the physics shop, (They are in my
office.)

I was not part oi the college
planning mill when the plans were
made to paint the wood trim the

lirown. Let's hope it was not
planned but a mistake A clear
stain would have preserved the
lovely contrasts between the light

 

sapwood and the rich dark heart-

weathering,

If they fwho”) had wanted to
paint something they should have
painted the neorpseudo Krmart
pecan paneling on the inside, a
poor substitute for the pleastng
nalural oak oi the old library and
corridors.

Old timers in the Science
Division will remember the uproar
when the wood on the north Side of
the building was painted. It was
possible to hide this mistake by
plantings, but we don't seem lo
learn. There is little possibility of
hiding [he new stark south wall: it
rises from a Concrete slab

Hopel‘ully, in the notrtoodistant
future, the paint will peel and a
resident art historian will discover
the loveliness ot the redwood.

It seems that the only crisis
iacing Grinncll College today is
that oi coed johns.

i mean, c’mon guys, is that all
you can get worked up over? is
that the only problem you see in
your daily lives? is that the single
issue of any importance in your
lives?

There is a real world out there
(as opposed to this $5.600
babysitting servicct with real
people and real problems. Or is all
that inconsequential? 15 life within
this sterile, artificial environment
all that matters?

I’m sure that you all will be well
prepared tor lire after Grinnell tii
such a thing existsl.

Don’t bea litterbug

To the editor: As new Students at
Grinnell College, we were amazed
by the amount of litter on the
campus. This problem was first
brought to our attention by the
numerous paper cups and wrap
pers and beverage containers
scattered near the Forum. Our
view of the Grinnell College
community as a progressive and
aesthetically aware people was
shattered. However, we realize
that only a small number con-
tribute to this eyesore. Fur-
thermore, we recognized the lack
of convenient trash Containers on
-mpus as the primary problem.
is problem will be the topic of
discussion this Friday at 7:15 p m
in the South Lounge oi the Forum
See you then ('lli‘is Matkili illlli
