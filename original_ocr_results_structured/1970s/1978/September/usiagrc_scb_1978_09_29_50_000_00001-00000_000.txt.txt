. Joint board freezes SGA alcohol funding

by Anne iiaiviniid

Al ii tensionriilled meeting on Wed
nesday night Joint Board voted to freeze
all SGA funding of alcohol, With the eXs
ception oi those parties already planned.
until the board could take further action

The decision came after a two and one
hair-hour debate centering on a proposal
approved by the Committee on Student
Life on Thursday, September 21.

THE CSL PROPOSAL states that ”No
funds collected or distributed by the SGA
may be used to purchase or acquire
alcoholic beverages.” The proposal was
moved by SGA President Greg Yoiitz.
seconded by Mary Jo LaDu, and passed to
0

The new proposition stems irom the
current Crackdown on underage drinking
caused by the change in the legal drinking
age tn low from 18to 19 years oi‘age

UNDER THE NEW law, institutions
providing iunds ioralcohol at social events
are automatically criminally responsible
for a serious misdemeanor which carries a
penalty at up to $1,000fine and-or one year

in jail. institutions also carry civil
responsibility lor personal damages
caused to or by an intoxicated minor,

Civil liability often carries a heavier
penalty than criminal liability because a
judgment may be given tor a large sum oi
money, especially in personal injury
cases A civil action also requires less
proof.

(‘SL PROPOSED the policy aiter a
temporary plan implemented by Dean of
Student Affairs .Iim Tederman involving
the use or bartenders at parties met with
general distaste and objection irom
students. 'l‘ederman maintains that the
bartender policy “was implemented on the
advice of the lawyer that the college was in
real danger of a lawsuit if an accident
were to happen." In his opinion, the whole
turmoil caused by the raised drinking age
is unfortunate because “the intent of the
law was for restricting high school kids.
“But,” he added, “it's not right for SGA
funds to go to alcohol when not all students
can beneﬁt.”

Youtz promised that the cut in alcohol

luliding byJoint Board wouldn't atleet hall
luxids for the ill tsemcstel'. “People will
find creative ways to use the money." he
stated

IN ('ASE TllF. lialls fail to use up the
money set aside. Youtz said the money will
go into the general budget and be allocated
for other events Such as films. concerts or
dances

He also stated. “We don't have a clear
notion oi how much money the halls spent
previously on liquor unless we go through
the receipts individually " Wes Kennedy.
SGA treasurcrr estimated that the all
campus James Gang Bang used $2151r0m
the general budget last year during iirst
semester. The Loose Hall Hall, the Dance
artlion and the Grinnell Relays received
$1,138 for their second semester activities,
Kennedy also disclosed that about one hall
oi the $7.300 total paid out by SGA ior hall
lunctions went toward the purchase at
alcohol.

WHEN ASKED llt‘W Schools in states
like Minnesota lwhere the drinking age
has been 15 for solnetimet handled the

problem 'l‘edcrmzm responded, “I called
up there and the diiicrcnce between them
and us is that we’re one oi the few schools
who use SGA iunds lor alcohol in this
region."

The Loosc llall Ball and the James Gang
Bang appear to be two oi the iunctions
hardest hit by the new proposal. Loose
Hall rep Owen Hall said, "James Hall askr
ed us to switch with them because they’re
not in their dorm, so our party will be iirst
semester We've discussed the problem
but it's too early to tell what will happen
yet."

KICK “HERMAN, the college lawyer,
said that the only way to have a party
under the new law would he ior students to
get together on their own and have
everyone bring his or her own drinks, it
would bc legal. he claritied, lor one person
lo collect money and buy the alcohol as
long as that person was in no way an ex-
tension or the college. Under the law even
the purchase oi alcohol by oilicers or
special clubs associated with the college

Darby bomb threat
proves to be a hoax

hy Trena Clcland

A bomb scare Friday night
resulted in the evacuation and
locking oi Darby Gym {or the
duration of the weekend, closing
KDIC and the Computer Services
Center for two and a hall days.
The threat, made from a
telephone on cam pus, was received
by college switchboard operator
lda Weaver at around to p.m.
According to her, a “serious
sounding male Voice" said simply,
“there is it bomb inside Darby
Gymnasium,” and hung up She
immediately alerted the (in-duty

The three men, along with
Sergeant .lcri-y llolcomb and a
patrolman irom the Grinnell police
force: met at Darby to evacuate
and lock the building.

BECAUSE 0}? THE ize of

Darby, an exhaustive search was
not made, although the radio
station and the computer center
were explored because the
potential tor damage was greatest
in those areas. Though the threat
was taken seriously, all those
involved agreed that extending the
search tor a bomb beyond the main
centers of activity in the building

would have been unieasible.
“That‘s something you cannot
take lightly/int: way, We took it
very seriously, You’ve got to. We

Wiley Says the lack of a lease
causes problems for her too. Since
her landlord, Bud Smith, refuses to
sign a lease. he can evict her or
raise the rent with little notice, She
Claims he has arbitrarily raised
the rent twice since the semester
began.

OTHER STUDENTS complain of
landlords who constantly check up
on them. Senior Jane Barclay says
0. H. Black, who rented to her last
year, oiten dropped in unex~
pectedly. “He likes to hang around
his tenants for the first couple of
months to see it you're going to
ruin his apartments . .he does stay
around and talk a lot, and It can get
irritating."

Senior Susan Haverstock says
Black walked into her bedroom
unannounced one morning while
she was still in bed. Haverstock
comments that Black has “cooled
off" since that incident and has not
bothered her so much,

BLACK CLAIMS ”E has to
