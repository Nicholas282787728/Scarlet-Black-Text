IM off to wet and exciting start

The rain and cold have not daunted Grinnell's
ever-intense IM softballers. This year's Season has
gotten off to another spectacular start with turnouts
in the hundreds over the first two weeks.

“Softball is the one IM sport where student at»

titudes haven‘t changed," a senior lM veteran
proudly exclaimed. ”It’s nothing more than
brutality. hardcore guts competition." She didn't
continue, though, as it was her turn to bat.
. Bruce Pake, a 3-year vet, said, “when I’m out
there on the field, it’s just me, the ball and God."
Teammate Doug ySpitz agreed. ”I can kill the
lexpletive deleted) ball‘,”

In past seasons, the number of runs scored were

, exceeded only by the number of beers consumed at
most games. This year, however, clouds have
provided most of the wetness thus far

This year's powerhouses come from all four
corners of Grinnell College. Off Campus 11 is a
definite contender lor the coveted IM Softball
Crown. In a recent outing they trounced powerful
Mears Hall 16-6. Led by the equally fearsome mouth
and hat of Doug (the Sultan of Sweat) Spitz. the
team is characterized by poise and experience.
Bruce lGeorge Foster) Pake has also been Wielding
a big stick for the on Campus boys.

Mears, in spite of its loss, is another toughie. Led
by fuzzy and loveable Moose Welch, the team is
marked by power and meanness, They disem-
bowled an obsequious Langan squad 2372 last week.
The other team which displays power is the Profs,

\ led by the honorable Reverend Haas and his home
run stroke. His celestial blast helped pin Off-
Campus ll 127 last week.

 

Loose; a dominant hall in all IM sports, lacks the
luster it showed in football and basketball
Nevertheless, the team has managed to secure a 2»1
record thus far in the season. They dropped a recent
contest to a bellicose Rawson squad, 1573. Rawson,
led by Cornell (Napoleon) Rudov, and Langan, led
by no one in particular, are the two north campus
powers. statistics genius Ben Sparks reports.

The team to watch may be Haines Hall, led by a
dubious combination of Wonder Women and ex
baseball jocks. Catcher Diane (Shimer was better)
Gutenkauf led an almostrallrfemale infield in a
recent victory over Cowles

Last Week. In another rainrsoaked thriller, Haines
dissected the Rush-Meddies 13-12 with a five run
rally in the bottom of the seventh inning. Softr
spoken Kevin O'Brien drove in the tying run with a
deep single to right following a two-run triple by ere
Grinnell Baseballstud Colin Sacks. Herman Farrer
drove in the winning run with a solid single.
strategically placed between the Second baseman’s
legs. John ilntentional Pass) Ilamby took the loss
while Brad tkeggae) Weiner got the win.

James Hall, known for musicians and English
majors. has been designated the ‘63 Mets of 1M
softball. The team has failed to show up for a single
game this season, one team member proudly
reported.

Hopefully. better weather and more beer will
mark the rest of this year’s IM softball season. Will
Haines remain the only undefeated team? Will
James ever Show? Will Strat- -Matic cards be
made for this year’s IM stars? Grinnell‘s IM softy
ball heads are dying to know.

Coach Cindy Winkler remarked
that playing a talented team like
Graceland had been a good ex-
perience for Grinnell. The contrast
between Graceland's level of play
and die level of most of the other
teams Grinnell has met this year
was obvious.

On Saturday. the women played
a triangular meet against Coe and
Cornell. Grinnell had nine runs on
eight hits against Coe, but their
opponents‘ comeback in the fifth
put Coe ahead. Final score was 11-
9, Coe.
