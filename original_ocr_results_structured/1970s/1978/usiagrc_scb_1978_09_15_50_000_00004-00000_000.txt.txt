Educational politics?

You may wonder why the trials and tribulations of the
music department are taking up so much space in the paper
this week. Politics in the hiring and firing of faculty mem-
bers—so what? It's old news. It happens all the time,

That’s the problem. It happens all too often. In music
professor Alan Leichtling's case, as usual, it is hard to
determine exactly what the circumstances are. The
Executive Council had access to student evaluations,
evaluations by colleagues, and information on Leichtling‘s
scholarship and credentials.

THE STUDENT EVALUATIONS were overwhelmingly
favorable, although they included constructive criticisms of
Leichtling’s teaching. Leichtling’s scholarship and
credentials could hardly be called into question. He has won
numerous awards, been nominated for a Pulitzer Prize twice,
and, in the words of music faculty member Kenneth Gold-
smith, was an “extremely gifted composer." As one student
remarked, “They (the Council] don’t understand the im-
portance of Leichtling being here and how 'much he's ac-
complished,”

That leaves the matter of colleagual evaluations. Certainly,

they should be included in the evaluation process. How much
weight they should be given, as Dean Walker points out, is
really up to the individual judgment of each Council
member. As long as all the evidence is weighed, the process
could properly be described as a fair one.

BUT, AS MUSIC student Kevin Zoernig remarked, there
remains “something fishy about his dismissal}: Most
students, including EPC members, assumed that Leichtling
would have no problem whatsoever in getting his contract
renewed, and were shocked when they heard the news of his
dismissal, as was Leichtling. All were aware, however, of the
tense situation which existed between Leichtling and other
members of the department. Many students came to the
assumption that this situation was a strong factor in
Leichtling’s dismissal.

If this is the case (and it appears quite likely}, then the
students have every right to be angered and aroused. Not
only has student participation been shunted aside, but the
whole affair smacks of political infighting rather than
rational decision making. It has left many music students
disillusioned and upset. “I resent the political nature of the
whole thing," commented Zoemig. “It seems to miss the
point.”

THE POINT IS, of course, that the primary motivation
behind all faculty hirings and firings should be education,
not departmental friction, Two teachers with different
philosophies of teaching should be able to exist side by side
in the same department, as long as their teaching ef-
fectiveness is apparent. It was apparent to most music
students that Leichtling was an effective teacher, and that
departmental friction was high.

Well, Leichtling is gone now, so this matter could be
considered a dead issue. The college was extremely lucky to
get a highly qualified replacement in Lee Cloud. But is the
issue really dead?

OF COURSE NOT. This type of situation has occurred
before, and will probably be repeated in the future. Is it
idealistic to think that something could be done to prevent
it? In a small school such as Grinnell, in a community where
rational values supposedly reign supreme, it would seem that
such incidents would be less frequent if people worked to
resolve their differences. ”The college can’t make its
decisions as a result of personality conflicts," Dean Walker
firmly stated. It would be wonderful if the college could
really live up to this statement

Letters to the editor

Misuse of resources will result in future problems

To the editor: I disagree totally
with Mark Finkelstein’s rebuttal of
David Blatt on the issue of present
and future economic trends. In»
stead of a point-by-polnt analysis
of Flnkelstein’s letter (and the
inherent beating around the bush it
would require), however, I'd like to
support Blatt's point or view,
predicting significant change in
the present economy.

Givena fixed supply bran energy
source, the increasing rate of its
use cannot Continue indefinitely.
This [act obviously places conr
Stralnts on future economic con
ditions. Since US. oil extraction
has already peaked, and world oil
production is expected to peak
soon, it seems appropriate to
examine the future potential of
various alternative energy sour»
ces.

COAL, TAR SANDS, oil shale,
nuclear reaction, and the sun seem
to have me most potential since
absolute amounts of the first three
of the above are rather limited,
they, too, must eventually go the
way of oil. Solar energy, although
limited in absolute terms in the
long run, differs in the fact that it is
available for human use only at a
constant rate of flow,

Present Consumptlon lhus
doesn’t decrease future use‘no
penalty for present use is incurred.
Although this is unremarkable ln
ilsell, the fact that no country uses
as much energy as that contained
in the sunlight which strikes its
buildings should be sufficient to
attract the reader 5 attention. This
says nothing of the amount of
sunlight energy that doesn't strike
our buildings (or even the earth).
The sun‘s absolute limits become
unimportant when it is realized
that we cannot live without it in the
event of its destruction.

THE ONLY REAL. long-run
alternative to solar power is
nuclear fuslon. This statement
becomes contradictory when ll IS
realized that solar power results
from a fusion reaction. It becomes
less remarkable when the ad-
vantages of scale and lsolallon of
the sun are conSldered

in addition to the greater energy
potential of sunlight, it is rather
benlgn lll its side effects, whereas
fossil fuels and radioacllve lucls
have adverse effects on other llfe
needs lair, land, and water)
Technological advances should
increase recovery possibllllies of
our more temporary energy
sources in the lulure,
technology itself requires energy.

 

but»

It is, of course, net energy
recovery which is important,
Unfortunately, advances in net
energy recovery come much more
slowly than do advances in
technology,

GIVEN THE necessity ol the
future use of solar power and
the depletion of highly con—
centrated fossil fuels, what will
become of current
energy-use practices? Perhaps the

.safest assumption is that society

will become more decentralized,
owing to the diffuse properties pl
sunlight. Less need not be accepted
if solar energy efficient
technologies are developed and
adopted soon enough.

For example, increased use of
passive solar home heating and
genetic selection of hydrocarbon-
producing plants would cause
increases in usable energy without
employing large amounts of
energy in development or imr
plementation. tThis may also have

 

important implications for
unemployment rates.)
ALTHOUGH THE PRICE

’60’s radicals were

To the editor: Reading Colin
Sacks‘s interesting piece on
Grinnell students in the ’60's one
gets the impression that they were
radical. In fact, they weren’t. They
were pussycats, Radicals don’t go

system (hopefully adjusted by me
government to internalize external
costs like pollution) serves
automatically lo allocate
resources, technology can increase
quantity supplied at each price.
Directed toward the proper
segments of the economy,
technology can smooul the tran»
sition from and bring aboul a more
complete replacement of fossil
fuels.

ll technology fails to allow
provision of energy at prices
comparable to those of today, total
energy use will diminish, all other
things held equal. Population
stabllity (an evenlual necessity
due also to space and food con-
straints), replacement of cars
with bicycles, decreasing
dislahces between homes and
places of work, eating more raw
foods, and even using fewer
electric lights are some examples
of energy-saving, less
materialistic practices that may
be necessary in the future. Bill

Co-op residents air laundry gripes

To the cdi r': We are outraged,
hot, and Slck of crawling with our
extremely heavy laundry across
the highway and over the campus,
only to be cursed at by dorm oer
cupanls who can't understand why
co-op houses don‘t have washing
machines. And a good question
that is Why don't cerop houses
have washing machines? Just. one
or two washers and dryers located
on Park Street would enrich the
lives 01 many a weary canopiter. The
existing laundry facilities are too
meager lpr dorm people, much less
for accommodation of ofircampus
grimy clothes.

We write this in |he heat or anger
after being forced to wait while one
young woman folded, plece by
plece, all of her underwear,

leaving lhe bulk of her clolhing

clogging the dryer.

The laundries have been built
with a bias. Let's correct this
