In ihopes of bettering the

a matter of careful planning,
Grinnell wants to have an ad-
ion‘al means of assuring con-

tinued adequate funding of that 311

per cent, and the purchase of a
metropolitan broadcast facility
constitutes a prudent and positive
move in that direction.”

The purchase idea originated
with one trustee who had many
associations with the comv
munications field, Turner said.
This trustee and the others were
impressed by the low risks in
volved and the excellent ins
vestment return rate.

Since one television station in a
city has little competition, Turner
noted, its profits will follow the
now oi a inflationaryleconomy,
Thus, the longer the property is
held by the College, the more
profitable it becomes, as long as
the economy. follows its predicted
trends.

Federal Communications
Commission approval oi the
venture will not be completed for
several months. Although WLWD
is an existing and operating
station, it must submit a rundown
oi its programming for FCC study
oi community awareness aild
service when ownership changes.
Thus, until the time consuming
threepart approval process ends,
the station Will be pending college
property status.

Financing of the situation is
“being negotiated," according to
Turner. Although industry sources
estimate the station cost at $13
million, half of Grinnell’s en»
dowment will not be spent. Loans
will figure greatly in the financial
arrangements. Other details have

.yet to be decided.

hypothesize about the decrease
but appears to be interested and
plans to inquire about the male
female ratio in other ACM
colleges at meetings this fall.

This year’s acceptance rate by
those students offered ad-
missions was 52 per cent, as
compared with 54 per cent for
last year‘s freshpersons, Ryan
stated that anything around so

rate.

New arrests made

by Mary Brown

Drug activity in lowa was once
more in the news this summer
with the arrest of several in
dividuals allegedly involved in a
drug manufacturing operation in
Tama County, Iowa.

Although the investigation did
not focus on Grinnell College, and
the case is totally out of the
jurisdiction oi Poweshiek County,
County Attorney Donald Schilds
said there is evidence that
chemicals from the college may
have been used to make various
drugs, primarily amphetamines.

According to Schilds, recent
Grinnell graduates were among
those arrested, and warrants
have been issued for the arrest of
other Grinnell students who have
not yet graduated, but
whom he doubts have returned to
the campus, ior obvious reasons.
However, Grinnell College
students and supplies were not
exclusively involved in the
operation, Schilds said.

Schilds emphasized that- of-
ficials have not singled out
Grinnell College in their in-
vestigatinns andthat state agents
may conduct probes without the
knowledge of local authorities.
Any investigations conducted in
this area, Schilds said, are in
recognition of the fact that there
is drug activity in all lowa
counties. In this regard, he
believes that “sometime within
the next year there will be oc-
casion when a drug agent would
be in Poweshiek County, and, as
part of being in Poweshiek
County, on the Grinnell College
campus”, (Dean of Student
Affairs James Tcderman wished
to dispel the rumor that he has
said narcotics agents are
enrolled in the freshman class.
To his knowledge, this is not the
case.)

Schilds also disclosed
outcome of the several

the
drug

arrests which look place late last
semester. The seven Grinnell
students involved were charged
with delivery [if a controlled
substance, a felony which carries
a mandatory five-year prison
sentence. However, Schilds
allowed them to plead guilty of
simple possession, an indictable
misdemeanor which does not
impose a mandatory prison term.

All of the students arrested at
that time (excepting one
juvenile) were convicted on the
charge of simple possession.
Schilds said all of those involved
paid fines ranging from $200 to
311110, and spent some time in the
county jail. He added that all
sentences of 12o days were
suspended, and that the
maximum time served was
twenty days. Other conditions oi
the sentences stipulate that all of
the individuals convicted be on
probation for two years and
participate in , a drug
rehabilitation program it ordered
by the probation officer.

Schilds said he has received

iThe age oi the deicndants.

iAn appreciation oi the ”peer
culture” existing on a college
campus.

-His own attitude that the
function of the law is primarily to
rehabilitate, and secondly to
deter others,

—The lack of prior police ace
tion on campus, leading to the
assumption of immunity on the
part of Grinnell College students.

Schilds, who took office in
January, 1975, said it was his
predecessor who set up the ac-
tivity which led to the May
arrests, and that he wishes to
maintain a favorable relationship
with the college community.
However, he believes that the
students have been warned. He
stated that college students, by

'virtue oi their iortunate position,

“have an extra duty to improve
society . . . and to bear in mind
that the person to whom drugs
are sold may not be the ultimate
user.”

Because of his concern over
individuals causing damage to

be occasion when a drug agent would be

handling of the case, but cites the
following considerations as
governing his action:

defendants,

others and to themselves, Schllds
says that he cannot guarantee
that future incidents Will he
treated so generously. He added,
however, that he feels “both
respectful and friendly toward
the college and college students.
and would certainly do anything
he could to explain to individuals
or groups what the Iowa law is,
and why it is.“
