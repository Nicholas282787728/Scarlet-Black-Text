it was a warm ninety degrees and
none ol the 234 seniors would be
donning cap and gown it it were
not commencement for the Class
of ‘67.

Many students would remember
May 25 as thedaytheybecamecrin-
nell alumni, but iew would realize
that the senator from South Dakota
to whom they were listening would
someday be a Presidential Candis
date.

The commencement beganpl‘ompts
iy at 2 o’clock on central campus
with the processional, “Coronation
March.” The invocation was fol-
lowed by the singing oi “America.”
It was during the first stanza that
“three pickets edged into the left
front between the stage and the
graduates.” The issue was not the
war, nor racial strife, but the bane
ning of the school yearbook by the
college on the grounds that it con-
tained potentially libelous material.
Now these three, the newly resigned
editors of the yearbook and the St“?
listened as George McGovern spoke
to all 1,500 people in attendance,
but especially them on The Highest
Patriotism. The following are ex-
cerpts from that speech:

From the beginningAmericawasto
be a nation diiicrentirom allolhers
Even as our country took shape,
monarchs in Europe were joining in
an Alliance to crush and suppress
all opposition to the existing order
We alone were seeking to establish
a nation where opposition and (115*
sent, free inquiry and public criti-
cism would not only be allowed, but
encouraged, For it was our iaiih
that in thc unending clash ofldeas
we could iind the sui-est and most
liberating pain to the iuiure.

it is this which tells us what is

most importantabout the American
nation: Americais notah established
or completed institution. it is not

a particular piece oi geography or a
collection oi people it is not even
a government or a Constitution. it
is a process. it is a method or
liberating the skill and Energy oi
individual men so they may Cons

being oi our people. Therefore, the
highcst iiithiulness to country does
not he in blindly accepting the idens
oi the past or the policies oi the
present, but rather in the Willlngr
ncss to question and challenge all
that we are and all we do, so we
may tiring the rcnhty oi America
closer to the ideal

The right to propose new ideas and
challenge old ones, to express the
conclusion oi mind and the com»
mands oi Consctence. is oitcn spoken
as a irecdom or a privilege it
is much more than this it is the
most imperative necesslly. it is not
just something we can live with, it
is something we cannot live without
it is not only consistent with pat-
riotism, lt is the higliestpntriotism,
First, because it is the way in
which we can correct our errors
bciorc theyovcrwhelmus it lsoneol
the grant virtuos oi ireedom that
we are not irretrievahly tied to our
mistakes At times, especially dur»
ing the Cold War period, we have
heard it said that our open society
was a disadVantage; that repressive
and authoritarian states could con-
duct more eiiective policies because
they did not have to coniront pub-
lic opposition History has proved
how wrong a View this is For when
a nation which prohibits dissent
makes an error, it is oiten come
pelted to iollow that error toward
disaster . What some thought
was our weakness has proved our
greatest strengths—the freedom to
shine the light oi reason on lolly
and thus to end it:

A second purpose oi dissent is to
improve our institutions and our
policies. , . ii We are to correct
injustice and enlarge ireedom, then
we stand in constant need oi light
irom inquiring and skeptical minds.
it does no good to say we will

permit only those ideas which are
sound and constructive For once you
decide to silence dangerous ideas,
you must establish what ideas are
site And that power is the power
to destroy liberty itscli. .

A third purpose oi debate is ihe
intensely conservative desire to
keep us inithtul to our own ideals
it is tempting, in the midst oi Illis
mediate dangers and diiflculties, to
sacriiice principles and evenllberty
to the necessities oi the moment
Yet it is the most dangerous course
at all. From the very be-
ginning we have ielt it necessary,
in the words oi ihe Declaration oi
independence. to pay a decent re-
spects lo the opinions oi mankind

, . Yet at times we act as ii no
other nation existed, as it we could
tlnunt our power and wealth against
the opposition and passions oi both
neutrals and allies, We appear Wills
ing to lorieit support and sympathy
alike in the sillgle»mlnded pursuit
oi our goals No course could be
more reckless or short-sighted
Those who dissent irom such pol-
icics are, ihereiorc, not attacking
their own country but patrioticnlly
trying to recall this nation to one
oi the oldest and great ideals

A iinal reason ior dissent is love
oi country, For true love oi couns
try is not merely the willing ac.
ccptance oi institutions or policies
it is the love oi an idea and tho
process oi freedom, . ii cons
science tells us we are iollowing
policies which damage the Couns
try, then patriotism demands we
oppose these policies
. Conviction and dedication
cannot be imposed ironi the top,
They must spring irom the tree

melt Liberty is not divisible You
cannot be iree to support and not
to oppose, to approve and not to
criticize And it we wish to tap the
unmatched energies oi the libers
also mind tor the work oi the
nation, each man must he able to
seek his own path to truth
It is sad that the obligation and

is not simply repeating the pledge

KDIC Survey:

in in sun nan uiiu-i

Rock, talk, and classical music
run a tight 1-273 in the race for
the ‘most popular KDIC program-
ming among the college listening
audience, a KDIC survey conducted
last week has revealed. The survey,
conducted by Kch stall members
Amy Abrams, Bob Thomas and Barb
Duncan, shows that 79% of theGrin-
neli student body listens to KDIC,
most oi them during the late after-
noon and early evening hours, alv
though only 35% oi the listeners are
aware oi, or listen to, the news
broadcasts at 12 noon and 11 pm.

KDlC hopes through the survey to
get a better idea oi the listening
preferences oi the students, to [ac-
ilitate programming in the (nture.

Rock music received a tavorable
rating from 194 of the 397 students
returning questionnaires, while folk
music was liked by 177 and classie
call by 156 "Oldies” and jazz and
blues were the only other types oi
music which received substantial
numbers at favorable responses,al-
though some students requested such
programming as African tribal
tribal music, Indian music (Ravi
Shankar), marching bands, the Marx
Brothers, and “motorcycle sound
effects."

Among the special programming,
such as non-music entertainment,
most respondents preferred live
music broadcasts over such alterna-
tives as plays, interviews, readings,
discussions, documentaries, and re-
broadcasts of lectures. Plays and
interwews also proved popular,

high schoolers. Rock music was also
their lavorite, although country ,
music, which was layered by vir—
tually no students at the college,
ranked second on the list.

lhe most treqllent complaint made
by the college Students was that
there is “too much babbling by the
disc jockeys.” According toonelis-
teller, “Too many of them are on
some sort oi ego trip." Several
respondents called tor ”the return

who preferred a “progressive rock”
type oi programming.

The 9 p.m.-12 pm, slot proved the
most popular tor listeners, being
preferred by 24% of the students
who listen to KDIC, while 16%favur-
ed the late night 12 p.m.-3 a.l'n.
slot, 15% listened ill the early even-
ing (6 p,m,—9 pm.) and 13% tavored
the late-afternoon programs (a pm.
,5 p.m.). The morning and early
aiternoon slots were enchpreierred
by losll% oi the listeners.

The survey was also conducted at
Grinnell High School, where only
25% oi the students said they lisA

wrote comments which were more
to the point One respondent said
he ”never" listened to KDIC “And
Iwon’t, either.” Another, reierring
to the weakness of the broadcast
signal, complained that "I can’t
even get Kch, and I'm not that
far from town ”

Among the high school crowd the
9 p m.~iZ pm. slot was also the
most popular, gathering 33% oi the
listening audience Others listened

ing the late night programs (13%).

buildings-raises questions beyond
the simple mechanics oldetermining
which buildings people want open
and what kind at security measures
are necessary. The college now
faces a problem which it has not
had tor the last several years, but
which the kind of atmosphere here
engenders--people are studying too
hard.

A school in such a restricted en,
vironment as Grinnell»ln at small
town tar train a large population
center--must guard against an air
mosphel-e where its students study
at the expense 0! developing the
non»intellectual aspects of their
personalities. Our main purpose
here, or course, is learning, but at
the same time we cannot completely
ignore other aspects oi human de
velopment.

The Joint Board this Week earned
the coveted John Keeble Memorial
Award for Punctuality. Showingﬂleir
respect {or SGA as an institution
and a strong desire to deal with the
interesting business at hand, only
about half oi the voting members
had arrivedbythe scheduled time for
the meeting. Enough people silage
gled in during the next 15 minutes
that the meeting could get Started.

in the President’s report Russ
talked about finding more office
space ior SGA. More space could
be created. he noted, by moving
non-student organizations such as
Admissions and SAGA out 0! the
Forum basement, this is the even-
tual goal. As money becomes avail-
able these offices will be moved,
but probably not until next year.

Another respondent, however, said
that "What l like about KDlC is that
the programming is so diversified,"
Several listeners observed that the
station should have n more complete
coverage oi local news events, par-
ticularly in crisis situations. More
than one Comment was directed at
the lack of information by KDlC
during the recent water shortage.
Most Students were unaware of the
twice daily news broadcasts. and
several commented that they would
begin listening ”Actually." com-
mented one, “I haven't managed to
ilnd you yet. it’s nothing personal.

while Russ may be working ior

what the students want when he
pushes ior extended hours in campus
buildings, he may at the same time
be working at cross-purposes tothe
actual needs at the students. how is
perhaps a time when the SGA should
take a lead in encouraging non-
academic developments-such as the
crait workshops which have been

started-and also perhaps work a-
gainst implementation oi policies
which would encourage people to
devote too much time to their stud-
ies. it seems as it extension oi build»
ing hours past midnight is too much
oi an encouragement ior people to
spend late hours studying, when too
much oi that is already going on.

Uniortunately. when they got there,
there really wasn’t anything to do
"not even a proposal by the Fi-
nance Committee to spark another
marathon debate. Craig Kugisaki
covered the usual round of commit-
tee appointments and meetings in
the Student Coordinator’s report,
and Anne Walter reported again on
her activities in the Career Services
area. She also announced that Craft
workshops have been organized and
that more extensive oiiermgs will
be available the second quarter at
this semester.
