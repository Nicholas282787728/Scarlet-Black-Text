Horecky: Says North Campus Apathetic

To the Editors:

On March 13 and l4, there were
meetings on North and South cam»
puses for students interested in the
issue of impeachment. The purpose
of these meetings was to provide
inrormation about impeachment ac-
tivities on campus and to enable
students to discuss impeachment
issues with Professors Wall and
Jones.

The respective levels of attend»
ance at these meetings on the two
campuses have once again demon-
strated that North campus is less
politically active than South cani-
pus. There were sixty people each
at the meetings in Loose and Mears;
only fifteen people showed up at
Yonkers, and a rousing total of
five came to Gates. During the
Yonkers meeting, l was appalled
to hear someone outside the loun»
ge shout, “l‘m for Nixon, and any-
body who wants to impeach him is

Drew: Corrects ARC Story

To the Editors:

1 would like to correct the mace
curacies and to point out the false
impressions found in the article
“ARC Seeks Student Help” in the
March 15 edition.

In the iirst place, the article de~
clined to elaborate on what the ex»
act nature of “Coffee Days” is.
Since students could most benefit
ARC by participating in the days,
it would have been helpful to ex~
plain that the participating restaur~
ants (which you failed to name)
contribute a certain amount to the
local ARC for each cup of coffee
purchased during these two days.
Also, you seem to imply that ARC
somehow runs the special education
classes in the city. Actually, the
school board is responsible for this

service. ARC does take a special

interest in special education, and it
has on occasion purchased special
materials for the individual class-
rooms, but it neither makes policy,
nor does it "sponsor" the programs
in Poweshiek County or Marshall-
town. ARCS in various counties have
provided the impetus necessary to
get new educational facilities built,
but the group does not usually re-
tain control of such facili es.

ARC draws its membership large-
1y from the ranks of special ed
teachers and relatives of retarded

l was quietly attempting, lastweek,
to enter lunch, when] was confron—
ted by a traditional Grinnell sign-
up table. It seems ISPIRG wanted
me to sign up for their “legisla-
tive alert." I thought nothing of it,
and passed innocently into SAGA,
where l was confronted by a rate

“Did you sign up," I asked.

“No, It all seemed rather Orwel-
lian to me," she answered. “It
sourtds like they want robots to
carry out their bidding, what with
all those sample letters, addres—
sed envelopes and position papers.
Why they don’t even give you the
two sides."

“No, that’s not the right spirit,"
1 ventured. “How else would you
know what to say if they didn’t give
you sample letters. It’s not that
you have to copy exactly, why I bet
if you changed an “A" to a “The,”
they wouldn’t care in the least.
Just so you get across the right
idea. And you really can’t expect
ISPIRG to provide opinions on both
sides, that would mean you'd have
to make your own choice, and what
with academic pressure, and all,
you’ll never have time. Besides,
you must see that anyone opposed
to people like lSPlRG must be fase
cist, money»grubbing, special in»

a son of a bitch."

One possible reason suggested for
the low attendance at the North cam—
pus meetings was that North cam-
pus residents may have attended
the meetings on South campus. This
writer was able to ascertain, how-
ever, that the overwhelming ma»
jority of students at the South cam-
pus meetings were, in fact, South
campus residents.

North campus has generally been
less active on national political
issues over the past two years.
There was far less support for
the McGovern campaign on North
campus and fewer volunteers. This
finding is based upon a poll taken
in October, 1972. Last fall, many
more students signed petitions for
impeachment on South campus. Al—
though many North campus residents
may have signed petitions on South
campus, the number of students who
expressed opposition to impeach-

citizens, though the Association
welcomes all interested people. Any
relationship with a “Volunteer Bo»
ard” in Grinnell is strictly inci-
dental, Meetings are held once a
month, and information regarding
upcoming meetings is usually pub-
lished in the Herald-Register.

Students who are interested in
working directly with retarded Chi-
ldren can become teachers’ aides
by contacting either Ms. Gustaison
at Davis School, or Pat Hosel (6»
6824), the campus coordinator of
the School Volunteer program. ARC
itself is an advocate—type group wh—
ose main focus is not direct one-
to»one service to handicapped peop-
le, a fact which your article did not
make clear.

incidentally, I don't think you would
call Pleasant Hill Schoolin Marshal»
ltown a ”vocationaltraining school"
though its student body is composed
of children who function in the ”mod»
erately” or “trainably handicap»
ped" range.

Finnally, because of the chronic
inaccuracies which plaguethis paper
this year, lsubmit that the campus
grapevine has become a more re-
liable carrier of correct informa»
tion than the Ser.

Well, maybe you are right about
that, but how\at>out this cause of
the week mentality, they're foster—
ing?"

“No, no, no, you must see that
college students would not want to
wade through all the bills the leg»
islatllre is considering. lSPIRG is
sort of like a secretary, sorting
the important things, for your cons
sideration.”

“Okay,” she replied, “but why
couldn't lSPIRG just sign the na»
mes of everyone who signs the pe-
tition to their letters? They could
save even more time."

“That’s totally wrong. This is an
example of participatory democra-
cy. For hundreds of years, people
have been doing what other people
tell them to. Do you want to miss
such a chance. The important thing
is that students will get satisfac-
tion out of spending five minutes
a week copying a letter to send
to the Iowa legislature. It does
not matter in the slightest that they

It’s inevitable. After all, whenthose

“Yeah, I guess so, but won't those

At that, I purposely choked on some

My argument is based upon a gen-

Sidents have been involvedin nation»
al and campus politics, Yet when we
consider overall politicalparticipa-
tion, the generalization has a valid»
ity. Anyone who has had experience
with political campus organizing will
c’onhrm it. it may be presumptuous
of me to assume that everyone must
participate in political affairs. But.
a failure to impeach Richard Nixon
will have the gravest implications
for the future direction ofAmertcan
society. If Nixon is allowed to stand
above the law of the land, the ten-
dency toward totalitarianism now
evident will be strengthened.‘ Poli-

necessity.

Poverty: the Forgotten Issue

by Fred Horecky

The impeachment of Richard Nixon
is the most urgent political nece-
ssity now facing the nation. Never-
theless, it would be unfortunate,
indeed, if the issues of impeachment
and political corruption were to 0b-
scure the disastercus effects of
Nixon Administration policy in other
areas of domestic affairs,

While the battle over impeachment
rages, the Nixon Administration has
quietly been dismantling the last
sagging remnants of the “War on
Poverty". Such a policy does not
constitute a legallyimpeachable off—
ense, yet Nixon certainly merits
“Moral" impeachment before the
bar of national conscience,

The ”War on Poverty", instituted
by the Johnson Administration in
rl964, was the first attempt to create
a poverty program at the national
level, The Office of Economic Opp»
ortunity set up ‘;community action
programs” in 900 localities. Comm—
unity Action agencies offered corn-
bines welfare, educational, and Dec»
upational services for the poor. It
was hoped that the poor would be
directly involved in the decision»
making process.

There are two basic reasons for
the failure of the War on Poverty.
First, middle class bureaucrats c0-
ntrolled the decision-making pro»
cess; there was no meaningful poll»
tical participation by the poor. Sec»
ondly, the Johnson Administration
squandered its economic resources
on the Vietnam War, and it became
apparent that ”war” could not be
successluliy waged on two fronts.

Despite failure of the War on vae
erty, community action programs

continued to function on a limited
basis until 970. Since then, Nixon
has used enormous inﬂuence
over the budget to phase out comm»
unity action programs. After June
30, 1974, these programs will no
longer have federal support. As
Nixon said, “any continuation (of
these programs) will be at the dis-
cretion of local communities. it
they want it, they will have to pay
for it."

Bite the Dust

The death of community is immi—
uent. State ard local governments
do not have the funds to subsidize
community action, according to
Mayors and Governors across the
country. Even if acurrent bill in Co»
ngress to extend funding for comm-
unity action it; passed, President
Nixon’s veto will kill it.

A second potentially usetul pro-
gram that emerged from the War
on poverty was legal services. Em-
ploying 1,300 lawyers in 49 states,
Legal services served about 2 mill-
ion clients. Legal service lawyers
challenged state and local authori»
ties on rules and regulations gover-
ning welfare and services to the
poor, and wereinstrumental in quad»
rupling the number of recipients
eligible for welfare benefits.

Atter a tour year struggle, the
Nixon Administration is now re-

.u‘i’i’lﬂilw‘. 2km

moving Legal, Services from the

Office of Economic Opportunity and
turning it into a “public corpora-
tion”. What this means, in essence,
is that the new “National Legal
Services Corporation” will not seek
to expand the legal rights of the
poor. It is Nixon’s view that the
poor have no rights, and he has
successfully destroyed the Legal
Services Program.

We have heard much talk from
thevNixon Administration aboutwel-
fare "reform”. These calls for re-
form have amounted to nothing, and
the same inadequate and unjust wel~
fare system that existed in 1968 is
in operation today. Although at least
twenty-four million Americans live
in dire poverty, the only concern of
the Nixon Administration is to re-
move “chislers” from the welfare
rolls and to force welfare reci-
pients to accept low paying, men-
ial jobs. it is somewhat ironic that
an Administration which has abet—
ted the greatest corporate rip-off
in history could demonstrate such a
concern about the “chiseling” of
the poor.

A truely adequate poverty program
has never been implemented in the
United States. There has been no
basic change in the distribution of
wealth and income in the U.S. since
1910, and our economic system is
predicated upon an acceptance of
great inequality. I suggest that the
first step toward the alleviationof
poverty should be the adoption of
a guaranteed annual income of
$4,000. There is little likelihood that
such a proposal will he adopted in
the near future. Poverty is now the
forgotten issue ofAmericanpolitics.

Freddie Gets His Soul Together

by time Green
Music Editor

In the last ten years a trumpet
player has developed from com-
parative non»existence to a posi-
tion of the highest order in the
jazz world. He is the most creati»
ve solosit since Miles Davis to play
the trumpet, and his name is Freddie
Hubbard. His most recent album is
called Keep Your Soul Together
(CT! 6036) and features Freddie on
trumpet and Fluegelhorn, George
Gables on electric piano, Kent Br»
inkley and Ron Carter on electric
and acoustic bass, Ralph Fenland
on Drums, Aurell Ray on Guitar,
and Junior Cook on Tenor saxop»
hone.

Freddie Hubbard is probably to-
day, with the exception of Miles
Davis, the only really brilliant a»
vant-garde trumpeter. Hubbard uses
structures, like the blues and the
popular song form, with very inter»
esting variations, and has develop»
ed new structures, involving shifts
in time-signature, form, and even»
modes. The albums he produced be~
fore this latest one were all mean»
ingful extensions of the work of
‘Trane and Miles, and are the most
interesting albums I have heard in
a long time, But even they are sur»
passed by the subtleties and creat»
ivity combined with restraint, taste
and beauty inherent in the latest

album.

The most beautiful composition on
the album is “Brigitte”, anine min-
ute track of mellow fluegelhorn and
backup, written by Hubbard, as are
all of the tracks. It iS a ballad in
ABAB form, with interesting har-
monies, and an excellent solo by
Hubbard, and by the pianist, George
Gables. it is a prime example of one

the
HE III

speaks out

side of Hubbard's brilliance - the
smooth mellowness and taste that
make up an artist. llis solos in
this regard remind me of a avant-
garde Lestor Young in their sheer
prettiness.

Another good track is “Spirits of

' Trane”, a piece that seems to be

dedicated to the memory of John
Coltrane, and is cast in the Trane
Mold. This shows of the other side
of the Hubbard coin-sheer fire and
creative virtuosity, in thetraditions
of Gillespie, Armstrong and Roy
Eldridge. There isn’t anothertrum»
pet man in the business today that
can surpass this phase ofHubbard’s

playing, and only afew that can equal
it -» Gillespie, Lee Morgan, and
Maynard Ferguson, are three of
them, and though Ferguson is good,
as far as creativity goes, the only
man among those three who has a
chance to catch up to Hubbard today
is Gillespie, whose importance in
modern jazz is unequaled by any
save Bird and Monk and Miles.

All tracks on the album show
various portions of both sides ofthe
Hubbard trumpet, and all are good.
The title tune is excellent and so is
the other one, “Destiny's Children".
All of the sidemen are good, Gables
especially so, but Hubbard over»
shadows all other efforts on this
album by his combination offire and
mellowness.

There is quite a tradition of trum-
pets behind Hubbard, descendingina
long line from the legendary Fats
Navarro, through Clifford Brown and
Lee Morgan. But Hubbard is worthy
of his lineage, more so than any
other man in the same bag,_ since
his is doing things with that horn
that even Miles didn't think of. So
hail to Thee, Freddie Hubbard, King
of Modern Trumpet, and Thanks for
letting us see you Keep Your Soul
Together.

Since Campus break is coming up
tomorrow, there is no Campus Mu~
sic News Department this week.

Keep Swinging
