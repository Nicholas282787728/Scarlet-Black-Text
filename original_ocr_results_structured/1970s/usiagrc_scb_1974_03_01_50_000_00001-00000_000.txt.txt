didn’t give the selection committee
much inlormation about how the ap-

The other changes involve the re-

Grinnell’s Help Line,which started
last Semester, is openforcallsfrom
college students as well as tawny
people every day irom 7-10 pm.
According to one of the college
students who volunteers at the Help
Line, “its purpose is not so much-
to say do this and this and this,
but rather just to listen and pros
vide someone who's willing to heal“
out people.”

All types of calls from personal
problems requiring counseling to
asking for information about birth
control to questions on wheresomee
one can order Meals on Wheels are
received. “We don'tjusthandlepsye
chological problems, but informa-
tional problems as well," the vol-
unteer explained. He said that the
Help Line volunteers make a lot of

“The Help Lille is a vent tor peo
ple, They use it to vent their pent-
up emotions to someone,” he said,
”We hear out their problems rather
than try to solve their problems «
icr them. Our job, tirst and tore»
most, is to listen. We only offer
suggestions ii the situation calls
for it,"

During the first three months of
Help Line’s existence, it provided
a service to a lot oi people, but lae
tely, according to this volunteer,
”calls have trailed on.” He atte
rlbutes this mainly to studa'lts’
lack of awareness of the line‘s axe
istcnce. “The vast majority oicalls
we get are from thetown," he added.

Another reason that college stu-
dents may not be calling, he thought
might he the person‘s reluctance to
talk to someone over the phone.
“It’s a more impersonalrespohse,”
he said, “The caller can’t tell it
we are bluffing or putting them on
or it we really are trying to help
them and listen to them.“ He cone

ple feel more at ease when they
