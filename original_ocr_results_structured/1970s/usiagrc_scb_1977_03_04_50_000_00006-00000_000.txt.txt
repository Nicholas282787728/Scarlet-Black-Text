‘ Mixed movies

by Peter iaron

The three films this weekend
have, absolutely nothing to do with
each other. That’s rightino
thorne, no axe to grind, no special
signiﬁcance to Blacks, Whites,
Jews, Gentiles. Gays or Straights.
They were not selected by the
Latvian Student Group and are not
presented in cooperation with any
other campus evens, in a year
which has seen the film chair»
manship besieged with requests
from every group on campus for
some specialty iilm, this weekend
should come as a refreshing
change.

Ifyou enjoyed Pumey Swopc last
semester. you might get a kick
out or another Robert Downey
feature, Gl-cascr's Palace, an
irreverent look at the Second
Coming as it could have happened
in the Old West. Greascr's Palace
is the story oi .lessy, a zoot-suited
young man on his way to
Jerusalem to become a singer-
dancer-actor. Jessy is leaving for
the Holy Land for “it is written that
the agent Morris awaits me.” in
the meantime he periorms a
couple of miracles (“I can crawl
again” rejoices a semi-successful
subject), and encounters some
very strange characters. This
gospel according to Downey is
served up with the director’s own
brand of humor; audacious,
perverse, and sometimes
sophomoric. Time magazine called
Greaser's Palace the “most ad-
venturous American movie" of
1972. iDue to the shocking nature oi
the film, no one Will be permitted to
enter the auditorium after the film
has begun.)

For Comedy in a more traditional
vein, try Our Man in 'Havana.
Carol Reed, of Third Man and Odd
Man Out fame, based this 1959 film
on a Graham Greene novel. Alec
Guinness is a vacuum cleaner
salesman in ore-Castro Cuba who
is mistaken lor an agent by British
intelligence. Guinness decides to
go along with his new identity,
takes a couple of toprsecret
blueprints, and scan finds himself
inextricably involved in the

island's political intrigue The
comic possibilities of the plot are
obvious. and they are well exr
ploited by a cast which includes
Noel Coward, Ernie Kovacs. Ralph
Richardson, and Burl lves,

The Conventional View of
American film during the
Depression is that the movies
provided an escape from the cares
and drudgery of the times. This
view ignores the considerable
number ol Hollywood productions
that dealt with serious and Con-
temporary themes. Films like 1
Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang,
20,000 Years in Sing-Sing, and Our
Daily Bread, forall their sentiment
and melodrama, did attempt to
deal with some of the real
problems confronting Americans
at the day: injustice, poverty, and
corruption.

Wild Boys of the Road (1933) is
about teenage runaways, whose
numbers swelled as a result of the
social and economic dislocations of
the Depression. The “Wild boys"
land girls, too) take to the roads
and railways and engage in run-
ning skirmishes with police,
railroad dicks, and other figures of
authority. The Nation, in a rare
bow to Hollywood, called Wild
Boys 01 the Road “exciting and
unusual,” and “powerful
Criticism.” Note how the New Deal
and the blue eagle ol the NRA
operate as a new “deus ex
machina,”

William Wellman, the director,
while not as well known as Howard
Hawks or John Ford, has had a
profound influence on American
cinema. Hi5 Wings (1927) won the
first Academy Award for Best
Motion Picture. The Public Enemy
(1931) established the movie
gangster idiom, and the original A
Star is Born (1937) did the same for
Hollywood tearrjerkers. With The
0X Bow Incident and The Story of
G.I.Joc also to his credit, it is
obvious that Wellman was a
director with a high degree of
competence that showed itself
through a wide range oi subjects.

Dance Troupe concert 9

After spending a tremendous
amount of time rehearsing, the
Grinnell College Theatre. Dance
Troupe proudly presents its annual
spring concert tonight and
Saturday night at 8 pm. in Roberts
Theatre, Solo, small group, and
large group ensembles will per
form to music ranging from the
13th century to contemporary jazz
and electronic pieces.

B.G. Voertman, lecturer in
theatre (dance), is directing the
concert appearances, In addition,
she choreographed a number or the

dances and will appear in several
as a dancer.

This year's performance will
feature the use of shadow patterns
and projections, made possible by
new lighting equipment in Roberts.
The designers, Mark Fischer and
MargitSawdey, will be running the
lights themselves instead of the
regular crew members. According
to the designers, the basic concept
of the concert is sculptural; there
will be more use oi side lighting to
help define movement. “Lighting
plays the role of scenery in dance,"

says Mark Fischer.

Members of the Troupe inci‘ge
Tana Acton, Elissa Barrnétt,
Randy Best, Bucci Buchanan,
Anne Fillmore, Beth Greenblatt.
Devon Griffith. Caroline James,
Meredith Johnson, Lauri
McLaughlin, Aldo Melito, lea
Miller, John Rensenhouse, Carol
Severln, Debra Smith, and
Katherine Vuper.
