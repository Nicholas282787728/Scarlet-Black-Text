Liberal arts questioned

by Bob Mitchell

The current discussion of
PresidentTurner‘s White Paper on
the future of Grinnell is typical ofa
broader debate going on in
American colleges and universities
concerning the nature and validity
of the liberal arts education.

The November 22, 1976 issue of
the Chronicle of Higher Education
exemplifies both the extent and
seriousness of the debate. It
contains two articles which speak
directly to this issue and show that
the reexamination of liberal arts
education is not a topic limited to
Grinnell's campus.

The Chronicle reports that a
Harvard University task torce has
done a two-year study of its un-
dergraduate curriculum and is
ready to recommend to the iaculty
there that a sixepoint standard tie.
requirements) be instituted to
guarantee that Harvard college
graduates “can be accounted iit
recruits for the educated company
or men and women." According to
Henry Rosovsky, dean oi the arts

,and sciences iaculty, these stanr
dards seek to guarantee that a
Harvard graduate can think and
write coherently, and be
knowledgeable in history.

 

‘literalure, art, religion. and

 

 

 

philosophy. In addition, they seek
i to insure that a Harvard graduate

has an awareness ofother cultures.
ethics, and must achieve a level of
protessional competence in a
particular iield.

Rosovsky believes that such
standards are necessitated by the
over-individualized structure of
Harvard's present undergraduate
curriculum program. He says that
this setup, even though it has
distributional requirements, does
not give a direction or meaning to
undergraduate education. The
Chronicle quotes him as saying
that current undergraduate
curriculum regulations at Harvard
“do not articulate any educational
priorities; indeed, they do not
carry the conviction that there are
any agreed upon priorities.” This
structure has proven inadequate,
he is quoted as saying, because
freshmen arrive at Harvard “ ‘unr
evenlyisometimes inadequately
prepared.‘ " Rosovsky ieels that
the next major task iacing the
college is .. ‘lo design a curricular
structure that Will balan the
legitimate claims of indi idual
interest and aspiration' ” with the
requirement that Harvard
graduates be intellectually \vellr
developed. .

Further evidence that re

 

examination .91 educationah
priorities is not a phenomenon

and. teasibility ot

peculiar to Grinnell can be found in .
the Chronicle's report of a spec."
given by Senator Charles Mathias
(R, Md,l which emphasized, in the
Chronicle‘s words. a “return
traditional goals." Mathias,
speaking to the National
Association of State and Land-
Grant Colleges, spoke of a need to
re-emphasize traditional liberal
arts education. and he is quoted as
warning the educators that their
“ institutions must not change
their basic purposes to reﬂect the
career goals of their students.’ '-

According to the Chronicle,
Mathias suggested to the audience
that the contracting job market oi
the 1970‘s has led to demands 0 c
the part of students and legislaté
for careerrlraining-oriented
education. Mathias sympathized
with those educators who rejected
this demand and was quoted as
recommending ” ‘a return,
Iradition’ ” in liberal arts
education.

Thus, the controversy
surrounding the White Paper is not
an isolated occurence. As these two
examples from the Chronicle show,
it is part oi a much larger dcbate
now going on in American
academic circles about the nature
liberal-, arts
education.
