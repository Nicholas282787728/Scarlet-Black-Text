A Meaningful Vote?

The upcoming election poses a dilemma for many Grinneli
students--where to vote, here or at home? In trying to de-
cide, each individual must assess not only the political situa~
tion in both areas and his own political ambitions and activi~
ties but the very nature of the act of voting itself.

A strong argument can be made, and is made by campus
political organizers, for voting in Grinnell. Wth Iowa’sliberal
residence requirements and the fact that one doesn‘t even
have to register in as small a community as Grinnell, no
,legal obstacles block the student vote. One does reside here
well over half of the year, and is given the opportunity to
meet a great many stateand local candidates who make personal
appeals for the campus Vote. Many students, given the right
to vote after coming to Grinnell, have developed what political
consciousness they have here, and are not acquainted with
the issues in their home states. ‘The necessities of academia
make extensive political activity outside the area next to ims
possible, and work in support of national candidates means
contact with local candidates and tucus on local issues.

On the other hand, voting here does seem a bit unrealistic
for some. Many local and even stateswide issues do not affect
the individual student or even the college as a whole and so
a decision on certain races maybe ill— or uninformed. Grinnell
is not seen as a permanent residence by most of the student
body, so issues here may be approached with a nearssighted
scope of vision, ignoring implications for the future. The mood
of the campus community could prove extremely influential,
particularly in state and local races where direct appeal
plays such an important role, In as small a community as
this, with a somewhat distorted View of events and issues,
an objective appraisal of the political situation as a whole is
hard to obtain.

Many of these objections to voting in Grinnell may also be
used as points against voting in one’s home state, however.
Lack of contact with the issues may be even more severe;
personal concern with the future in one’s home area may also
be negligible.

Taking these considerations into account, the decision of
where to vote may have to be made on pragmatic grounds,

Rawson. Truth 0t Garst Told

To the Editors:

We wish to point out that the facts
in the article, “Garst (the Eagle)
Revisited" are simply lncorrect and
incomplete, In particular we wish
to correct the story concerning
Rawson and Clark halls.

The facts: Rosalyn Garst was in
Rawson lounge during a Rawson-
Clark rap on “Sex in crinnellx'
A few Clark men had pried themv
selves from their television to al-
tend the meeting where they saw
Rosalyn, Later that night a Rawson
woman was studying in the lounge
when six Clark men entered and lug-
ged Rosalyn away. Understandably
incensed, she proceeded to awaken
some loyal Rawson women. Knows
ing the lifeblood and raisoii d'elre
oi Clark was the Ly, set, our work
was Cut out tor us. After severing
the umbilical cord (detaching the Set
trom the antenna wire) we werecar-

Le. Where will my vote have the most effect? If a number rying the t.v. perched on a chair

. of home elections will be closely contested, the impact ofa
single ballot may draw one to vote there, simply out ofa
desire to be a crucial voice in the elections.

Thus several basic questions should be taken into account
in deciding which ballot—box to turn to: Where dolfeell
can get the most accurate information regarding the issues
and candidates? Where are the issues that 1 take a firm stand
on most clearly involved in the choice between candidates?
The decision is one which must be reached individually,

but must be given serious consideration.

October

Feel like paying tribute to a lighthouse? Or downing a heaping
plate of macaroni? Or perhaps your favorite pasttime is
preventing tires, honoring the boss or paying homage to the
local pharmacy. If so, October is the right month for you.

Don Reid, Secretary of the Iowa Press Association, has noted
in a recent IPA bulletin (cited in the Montezuma Republican)
that the month of October is not only lowa Cooperative Month
and Country Music Month, but, for the benefit of those who
delight in the pleasures of the tastebuds, is also Pork Month,
National Restaurant Month and Gourmet Adventurer’s Month.
It is also “a month to set aside for Indoor Games, for which
no definition is given.”

Contained within are Newspaper Week, National Pharmacy

Week, Drug Abuse Prevention Week, National Macaroni Week,

National Fire Prevention Week, National 47}! Week (an event
of prime importance, no doubt, to Iowa) and, of course, the
everspopular National Lighthouse Week.

For those history buffs among the crowd the month contains
both Columbus Day and Leif Erickson Dayi Itis also the month
for National Boss Day, upon which employees honor their
chiefs. Environmentalists, however, can take pride in having
the greatest week of them all: October 21 to October 27.
which is set aside as International Whale Watching Week. If
all else fails. . .
