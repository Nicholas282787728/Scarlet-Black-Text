eFell House

- brings efficiency

By Patty Best
‘ Two weeks ago, the offices of Career Services,
cg Student Aftairs, and Academic Advising finally
moved into Fell House at 1119 Park street Ac-
cording to Jim Tederman, Dean of Student Affairs,
the idea of combining these three offices originated
several years ago, but the iunds were not available.
The class of 1925 made the combination possible
through a designated gilt in memory ol Robert B,
Fell, the agent for the class of ‘25 and the general

agent for all Grinnell alumni. After the project was

iuncled, last fall’s B&G strike delayed the move, as
did the 13er work schedule for window installation

on South Campus this year.
‘ Now that the move has been completed, Tedere
'iman says that the services offered by all three of-
fices will be more efﬁcient, since they will be able to
work more closely together. Student referral to
another service will be easier, as will cocoonseling.
~§ Files on students that may need to be shared by the
.services are more accessible. The move has also
been economically eiiicient. since the new grouping
makes better use or secretaries, so that one part-
time secretarial position has been eliminated. The
amuuntof equipment has also been reduced, since
machinery in Nollen House, such as the duplicating
machine, are close enough for Fell House to borrow.
The move has been equally beneficial for Career
Services, according to the Director of Career

Hamburgers,
Fries,

Services, John Adams, The Career Services office
in Buriing previously handled about 15-20 students
daily. The office was crowded, and reference
materials were not always displayed where the
most people could see them. In contrast, the Fell
House quarters can handle 1520 people at a time,
with reference materials more accessible than
previously. Adams feels that the extra space has led
to a more relaxed atmosphere which will encourage
students to come and browse. ‘ /

The new Career Services office has more visual
and aural privacy than the old office. Another
improvement is a recruiter room, where students
can be interviewed by vi ting recruiters.
Previously, interviews took place in lecture rooms
in Burling basement provided the rooms were
unoccupied by classesi Also, workshops for as many
as twenty people can now be held in the new
seminar room (as soon as the furniture arrives).
The new Career Services facilities already appear
to be a success; on Monday, 27 people, and on
Tuesday, 26 perople visited to get information about
graduate schools. employment opportunities, and
summer jobs

The library will expand into the vacated Career
Services Office, the former Office of Academic
Advising will be used by Admissions, and the s.G.A,
will move into the old office of Student Affairs,

Grill prices change

By Tom Palltea

Among the changes taking place
on campus recently have been a
few revisions in the operation oi
the Forum Grillr After October
break there was the new location of
the cash register to adjust to. Now,
after Christmas vacation, there is
a new set of prices.

According to Keenan Roberts,
director of the food service, the
price changes were brought about
due to changes in the cost of the
food purchased. Both higher and
lower costs are being passed on to
the consumer, Through new
contract agreements with load
suppliers, the cost of hot dogs and
ham has been reduced allowing for
a 10 cent cut in price for a hot dog,
from 40 cents to 30 cents, and a 5
cent cut in price lor cold ham
sandwich from 70 cents to 65 cents

The price increases came in the
dairy food and beverage category.
Cottage cheese has gone up 5 cents,
from 25 cents to 30 cents, and milk
and ice cream prices increased 4
cents. Soft drinks went up 4 cents,
raising the price, with tax, to 20
cents. Finally, coffee went up 4
cents to 14 cents, with a new 12 oz
size being oilered tor 2 cents.

The new prices were i listed by
Roberts after approval by Ralph
Pomerenk, administrative
supervisor of the food service.
Roberts said that most prices at
other schools using the SAGA Food
Service went up last year and that
he refrained irom boosting prices
as long as possible, He also said
that price increases were not so
drastic or extensive when all the
increasing costs oi running the
Grill are considered,
