Lettuce

suppw
vanes

United Farmworker lettuce has
been unavailable in campus dining
halls since the reopening of the
dining halls.

Keenan Robert, food service
director, stated that Grinnell was
onc of the tow places in Iowa to use
urw lettuce. The school's supplier
in Des Moines has to buy 100 cases
at a time in order to get a shipment
from California. SAGA's usage is
one 25 cases a week. Because of
this, many times the lettuce used is
24 weeks old,

During the break the supplier did
not order any UFW lettuce and a'
shipment expected late last week
did not arrive until late Wednesday
night.

“We honestly never know it we are
going to have it until the truck
backs into the door."
