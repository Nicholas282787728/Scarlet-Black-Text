Hey There, Clark Supporters,
Your Credibility Gap ls Showing!

YOUR CHARGES AGAINST JACK MILLER'S RECORD -AND THE ANSWERS

CHARGE: Against OneaMan, OneeVotc Rule. ANSWER: He
voted for the Constitutional Amendment providing that one
house of a state legislature mite! be on oneaman, oneavote basis,
with the people of the State, in a general referendum, having
power to decide whether other factors should be used for the
second house, Don’t you trust the people? Jack Miller does,

CHARGE: Against Medicare for Senior Citizens. ANSWER:
Against the Johnson Administration's Medicare billiyes. It
provided free Medicare services LO anyone over 65, rich and poor
alike; and left out in the cold those under 65 suffering from
Catastrophic accident, disease, and illness. Jack Miller’s Medicare
bill Coveredthose who needed Such beneﬁts and didn't have the
serious defects of the Johnson billi retroactive disallowance
of payments, forced Contributions from those who Can't aﬁord
them, and the deductible feature which low-income people
Can‘t atiord. Senator Rihicoff (Democrat, Conn.) said last
December-2 “ll‘I knew then what I know now, we would never
have passed the bill, but would have set up a pilot program to
work out the defects before enacting a national program."
Quite a statement from the former Secretary of Health, Educaa
tion, and Welfare during the Johnson Administration!

CHARGE: Against a ban on poll taxes. ANSWER: Even the
Democratic US. Attorney General opposed this, and it was
dc/eated. But why didn’t you point out that Jack Miller voted
for the Constitutional Amendment outlawing poll taxes in federal
elections (now the 24th Amendment to the Constitution)?
(3/27/62)

CHARGE: Against rent subsidies to help poor people live in
decent housing. ANSWER: The proposal was drawn in such a
manner as to discriminate against those paying full rent and
having no more income than some receiving rent subsidies.
Why didn't you point out that Jack Miller voted for the pro—
gram when these defects were removed? (9/20/67)

CHARGE: Against requirement that Senators reveal their
ﬁnancial interests. ANSWER: This was defeated, and properly
so. A proposed Code of Conduct was being drawn up by the
Senate Ethics Committee (which you forgot to point out Jack
Miller Supportedialong with amendments to make disclosure
requirements stronger), and the proposed amendment was merely
a grandstand effort by former Senator Clark of Pennsylvania to
jump the gun on the Committee.

CHARGE: Against making it illegal for Senators and lobbyists
to conduct joint business ventures. ANSWER: This proposal
was tabled 37:22, and properly so. The Ethics Committee was
then considering the case of Senator Dodd and asked that the
Senate take no action that could reasonably leave an inference
against the accused. Another grandstand by Clark. (Covered
by Code of Conduct.)

CHARGE: Against Income Tax Credit for College Education
Expenses. ANSWER: The Democratic Committee's researchers
missed here. The date was 4.14.57. Killed by the House, the
amount of the credit would have averaged 3200:3300 a year for
Iowa students: grotesquely inadequate for students from poor
and middleaincome families. Why don’t you point out that Jack
Miller supported the Higher Education Amendments Act of
1972 which will provide really meaningful grant aid?

CHARGE: Against defer 'ng Peace Corps and VISTA volunteers
from draft. ANSWER: This was overwhelmingly defeated 7-65
for obvious reasons.

CHARGE: Against taxing corporations ferwartims excess profs
its. ANSWER: This was defeated overwhelmingly 18-74. Mem-
bers had 30 minutes' notice of this amendmentia snepsge
proposal. The Contract Renegetiation Board was doing a good
job anyhow. Just a grandstand by McGovern.

CHARGE: Against strict controls on use of wiretap and elec.
tronic surveillance equipment by federal and state police
ANSWER: Your description is deceptive. This was an amend-

CHARGE: Against Food Stamp Program. ANSWER: YOUR
CREDIBILITY HIT A NEW LOW, Jack Miller voted FOR it!

CHARGE: Against cutting oil depletion allowance for oil coma
panics. ANSWER: Not so simple as that. One vote was to
retain the 271,; percent depletion allowance. Jack Miller voted
NO. The other was the meataaxe proposal to cut it from 27;;
percent to 20 percent. Neither was fair, because some oil com.
panies plow back their depletion allowances into development of
oil and gas resources for our consumers (as Congress intended),
while others simply pay out the savings to stockholders. Jack
Miller's “plowback” amendment was defeated in Committee.
it would have cut those who didn‘t plow back and left those
who did alone. It is grossly unfair to treat them all alike, and the
Treasury Department is researching the “plowback” approach.
The meat»axe reduction inevitably shows up in higher prices
for gasoline, or have you noticed? And then there’s the energy
crisis—or do you care?

12.20.69 CHARGE: Againstextendinglifeofpoverty program. ANSWER:

Not so simple as that. This was a vote on the confer-once report.
If the report had been rejected, the conferees would have gone
back to conference to try again. The report demolished the
Senate's original version providing the Administration with
broad discretion for transferring money from one program to
another as it had requested,

CHARGE: Against right to privacy by supporting “noaknock.”
ANSWER: Well, this was approved 70715. It authorizes “no-
knock" under a search warrant if the judge issuing the warrant
is satisﬁed that there is probable cause to believe that other
wise the evidence (narcotics) would be destroyed or the life of
the ofﬁcer would be endangered. What’s so bad about that?

CHARGE: Against three Senator Hughes’ amendments pros
viding for scientific and medical research and analysis of drug
use and effects. ANSWER: No. Against twaiboth defeated,
and FOR one (approved 42—41, with Jack's vote making the
diﬁerence). The defeated amendments would have put control
under HEW instead ofthe Attorney General. No question about
the research.

CHARGE: Against equal, nationwide enforcement of federal
desegregation policies. ANSWER: Well, this amendment would
have treated de jure segregation cases (largely in the south)
and de facto segregation cases (largely in the north) the same.
Pending a ruling by the US. Supreme Court, Senator Miller-
felt it premature for legislative action. The House did, too, and
the amendment was deleted.

CHARGE: Against establishing an Equal Educational Opporr
tunity Committee. ANSWER: We have too many committees
already. The Senate Education and Labor Committee is pEr»
fectly capable of handling this activity.

CHARGE: Against Child Nutrition Act’s school breakfast and
school lunch for kids from poor families. ANSWER: Oh, my,
it wasn’t that bad! Senator Miller voted FOR the program when
it was passed the next day (or did you bother to look?)

CHARGE: Against lowering voting age to 18. ANSWER: The
old half-truth technique. He voted against doing so by statute,
because he felt strongly that it was unconstitutional. By a 5:4
decision, the Supreme Court said it was constitutional for federal
elections and unconstitutional for state and local elections. When
you vote for Governor and local candidates November 7, just
remember that Jack Miller was an original Co-sponsor and not
urally voted FOR the 26th Amendment to the Constitution
which enables you to do so!

CHARGE: Against limiting Tv.deio Campaign Spending.
ANSWE : False. This vote was on a short—Sighted proposal to
put limits on such spending for general elections, but no limits
at all for primaries. That’s why Senator Miller voted against it.
When this defect was removed by the Conference Report, he
voted FOR it. (9/23/70)

You have picked 23 votes out of a total of over 3,600 record votes during
Senator Miller’s 12 years of representing us in the Senate. He has an out.
standing record, and we are conﬁdent that fair-minded young people will
overwhelmingly reject your deception and pettiness.

merit (defeated) to strike from the Crime Control Bill the
authorization for such surveillance for up to 48 hours without
prior court approval where an emergency situation existed. The
supreme Court has repeatedly recognized the right to make
searches and seizures in exceptional circumstances. Adoption of
the amendment would be telling Cosa Nostra that if it held
important meetings, finish them’ within 48 hours and it would be
home free. Severe penalties for abuse were provided.

CHARGE: Against cuts in military spending. ANSWER: These
were Clark amendments, overwhelmingly defeated 4432, 13:54.
More grandstanding.

And what has Jack Miller’s opponent dune?7NOTHING.

Re-Eleét Jack

MILLER

United States Senator

CHARGE: Against providing money for Headstart for poor
kids. ANSWER: Oh, come now, it wasn't that bad! The budget
Jack Miller supported called for over $300 million for Head.

art! This was an amendment to add another $25 million to
i an increase even President Johnson hadn’t asked for. Tire
amendment lost, too.

CHARGE: Against auditing Defense Contract Spending for
overruns. ANSWER: Not quite that simple. This was an amend-
ment (adopted 47:46) to require quarterly reports on major
contracts for development or procurement, and to authorize
independent GAO audits of major contracts. All of these cons
tracts are already audited under established procedure, and
the GAO needed no authorization for such audits anyhow. (This

 

was made acceptable by the llouse by requiring GAO to limit
such audits to selective and “representative" cases.)

YOUNG IOWANS FOR MILLER:
Marsha Henry. lowa city, Chairman. Mike Fleming. Sibley, Treasurer.
