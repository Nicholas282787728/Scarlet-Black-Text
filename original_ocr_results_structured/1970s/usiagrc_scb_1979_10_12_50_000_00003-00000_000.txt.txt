Bawdy Shakespeare comedy

¥ highlights wee/e

Ere comes the twelfth of this October month

The bard’s sweet words shall fill the gusty air

Of our parti coloured autumn For three brief nights
(Or what you will) a bawdy band will play:
Malevolent Malvolio and Fests,

Sir Toby and a cheeky Sir Ague’,

Olivia, the Duke and mistook twins

Shall grace, along with other jesting clowns,

Our Roberts stage and bring to us delight.

It is dear William Shakespeare‘s own Twelfth Night!
—(AIS)(

Also in this 1—ssue is a piece that some may consider controver-:
sial: Cary Rasof’s s”Diary of a Faggot.” The piece centers on
the emotional problems one experiences when trying to come to
grips with homosexuality. It offers insights into being gay that
no objective article could hope to presenteit’s “must” reading
for anyone who hopes to understand anything about the gay ex-
perience.
