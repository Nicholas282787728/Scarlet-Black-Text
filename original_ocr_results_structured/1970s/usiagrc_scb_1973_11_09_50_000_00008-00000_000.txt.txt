Sports Illustrated, although
having had a three part feat
ture on women's sports ear-
lier this year, doesn't offer
much in the way of women's
coverage. Television and me
did stations don't oftcn give
women’s results unless there
is a humorous angle. Daily
papers rarely report women‘s
scores, as contrasted to long
lists of men's results.

The lists of discriminatory
policies against women are
long. Illinois is perhaps the
most blatantly anti-female,
even though this is being cha-
llenged in the courts. Girls
are not allowed to partici'
pate on boys teams.’lhegitls’

Would you believe that Iowa

pate in 17 state Champlotr
ships in 13 sports. The prer
mier is basketball where 438
schools participate. The state
girl's tournament held in Des
Moines often tiutdraWs the
boys tournament. Tht- girls
have expressed the feeling
that in their 0W“ schools they
may be looked up to a little
more, but that there are still
those who leer them as
“locks," usually nontatht

Ifa school has programs for
boys and girls in the same
sports, they should be sepa-
rate and equal. However, and
this is where the controversy
arises. if there is a boys'
team in a sport andlio gii-ls'

enough to make the boys' team,
then let her play. The malori-

Gridders Tumble To 0-7

by Dave Sdlechter
The first winless season in
21 years faces the Grinnell
Pioneer football team as they
prepare for tomorrow's fit
nale, an away date at Knox.
Not since 1952, when Grinnell
was 078%. has Grinnell had
a season as poor in record
as this year's. last Saturday,
in the home final on Ward
Field, the Pioneers fell to St.
Olaf 4&7. The highlight for
the Gtinnell fans was Tom
Goetz's scoring the lone Grlnt
.nell score on a Atyard run
with 1:01 remaining in the
game. it capped a 35-yard
drive in whi‘di Goetz pined
22 yards in five runs. Quar-
terback Paul Delaney claimed
the remaining 13 yards, pas-
sing to Wally Bowers for six
and bootlegging around left
end for seven.

Grinnell gained 109 rushing
yards, on of those belonging
to Goetz. Grinnell was 6 for
16 in the air for 49 yards.
The Oles ran the ball for
38;! yards in 71 carries,paced
by Mark Gene's 134 yards.
Gelle scored twice forSt. Olaf
as did Steve Peinovich. The
Dies, in this ﬁnal appearance
at Grinnell as they leave the
Midwest Athletic Conference,
also gained 22 yards in two
completions in the passing
column.

Knox is in fifth placeinleag“
ue action, havingthe third best
defense and the seventh best
offense. Coach Edd EoWers
commented on the St. Olaf
mine, “They foundaweak spot
in our defensive line and just
kept coming after us...We
moved the ball when we got
blocking,"

DECORAH, lA- Riding a
three game unbeaten streak,
the ﬁeld hockey team jour'
neyed upstate laStweek for the
regional all’stal‘ selection to-
urnament, only to have the
streak snapped Saturday aft
ternoon when University of
Iowa gained a 2-0 victory.
A morning 2-2 tie with Iowa
Wesleyan had given the wo-
men a somewhat shortrlived
four girlie unbeaten string.
Despite the disappointing
showing at Decorah, two Grin-
nell players made second-
team of the all-state field
hockey squad and a third res
ceived an honorable mEnUODi
Senior Laura David and jut
nlor Mary jane Elam were
named to the team which will
represent Iowa against Illi-
nois in the upcoming‘inter-
state rivalry game. Ellen Gra
ady received praise for her
play against Iowa Wesleyan.
Iowa Wesleyan, in the Sate
urday morning game, per
formed welli in reversing the
pattern of Lhe previous week's

matchtup between the two clr
ubs, which the Pioneers ease
ily won, 5-1. Playing whatone
Grinnell player called “fired
up hell," Iowa Wesleyan ne-
ver allowed Grinnell to pull
away. The Pioneers tallied
first, as Lenore Miller broke
into the scoring column. Iowa
Wesleyan roared back with
two goals, leaving to to Mar
nie Fox to salvage the 2,; tie.

Fox's goal was her second of
the campaign.

The P.M. contestwas similar
to the other two Pioneer-
Hawkeye games. University of
Iowa maintained control
chrough much of the game
and was able to hold on to its
early 2-0 lead for thevictory.
It was the third consecutive
time that the Pioneers had
been held scoreless by the
stiff Iowa defense. ”We were
kind of tired out, after a Week
(Mid-semester break) with no
practice," explained a Pioa
neer forward. The final field
hockey record is 2-5el, same
as the soccer team.
