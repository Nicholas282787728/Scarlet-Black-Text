Gilmour: Beiore we get on the second
question, id like to get the insights of the
group as to where labor is going to he in
this The now came out recently tor Mus-
kie. The Teamsters _. heaven knows with
all the efforts Nixon has been making ~-
may still go Republican.

Hottois: Well, except that he’s now got
Harry Bridges screaming and yelling.
There’s the possibility of the merger of the
Teamsters and the longshoremen . . , lfind
it somewhat inconceivable that labor leader-
ship could change its position . . , Labor is
becoming much more Republican in its
membership. We know thatGeorge Wallace
drew a good deal oi support from segments
oi the population one would normally asso—
ciate with organized labor.

Gilmour: Although this was not in the North
as much as was expected.

Hottois: Well, if you look at the areas of

cities where Wallace drew suppon it was
from areas which you would expect to be
the most radical sort of labor support.
He hurt the Democrats more than the Re—
puhlicans.

Gilmour: Really Wallace didn’t hurt Humph-
rey that much in the North. But that's not
the point; I want to know where the AFLV
Clo is; m pretty sure its going to be with
Humphrey. They have never made it clear,
but there have been testimonial dinners all
over the country; there was a big one down in
Florida just for Humphrey.

Hottois: There’s that long history of co-
operation. You certainly can'tassess where
the arncm is going to go on the basis 0
where the UAW goes. '

Moore: The AFL—CIO is keeping quiet;
ii Jackson is picked they may well back him.

831B: You've indicated that there aren’t too
many differences between what Muskie and
Humphrey would like to see done in the
country, what they’d like to do. what they
think is good and so forth, though there are
differences in their image. l’d like to have
you make some comparisons between
Humphrey and some of the other candidates,
particularly McGovern, in terms of what
they’d like to see done, what their expressed
views have been What significant differ»
ences or similarities are there between
Muskie and McGovern?

Moore: Well, McGovern is more liberal,
particularly on loreign policy.

Orr: Maybe on taxes, too.

Gilmour: There are really no measurable
differences between the candidates, except
Jackson, on the Vietnam War . . . Even
Humphrey, with the exception again of his
mistakes in the Vietnam policy, has a goon

Democrats would attempt
more social reform . . .

record on foreign policy.

Hottois: Let me just respond to that, because
I think that this speaks to the question ol
their differences. l’m not even sure that
Humphrey made mistakes on Vietnam. Lynr
don Johnson made the mistakes, and Humph—
rey was his Vioeepresident. it you expect
a Vice-President to disavow his President,
then you’re expecting something he honestly
can’t do.

Gilmour: The tact is he’s arguing, and
Johnson’s memoirs support this, that in
the Security Council from about the latter
part of 1966 on he argued against escala-
tion, he argued against bombing, I think
where he can be properly faulted is that
then, after he tried to change the policy
within the inner councils. he lost and then
went with the majority view.

Orr: I want to discuss the difference be—
tween Nixon and the top Democratic Con-
tenders. lt’s that the Democrats would
attempt to make more effort at social re~
form, for instance bussing and some of the
things that are pretty controversial that
you think of Nixon as not doing,

Hottois: I think the one thing which tradi-
tionally differentiates the Democrats from
the Republicans, and probably most clearly
from Richard Nixon, is that the Democratic
party has been the party with some sort of
a vision, some sort of a notion, not neces
sarily oi rerorm, but to be moving ahead
to new things. I think if you look at Nixon,
he doesn‘t necessarily represent the tradi»
tional Republican views. He is much morea
politician who operates on the basis of ex-
pediency, and i think you can see that clear-
ly in his policies. I am sure that nobody in
1968 ever expected that he would recognize
or take a trip to China or go for a wage
price freeze. it he had proposed that in

1968 he would have been drummed out oi
the Republican party.

Gilmour: Well, Tom Wicker observes that
many of the proposals that Nixon has made
have been extremely liberal. The Family
Assistance Plan was a direct break with
the whole philosophy of the Republican Mid-
west.

llottols: How about the plan to wipe out
local property tax and replace that with a
national sales tax?

Orr: At least he’s recognizing the problem
of the property tax.

liottois: But in another sense that's the
sort at thing that midswestern Republi-
cans traditionally haven’t liked at all.
That’s big government.

Orr: But this is the reason 1 think he’s
going to have such an advantage.

8&3: Why try to beat him, then, if what
Tom Wicker says is true? Or is what
Tom wicker says not true?

Gilmour: Well, I think where Nixon can
be faulted is not on his record, because
it is in most cases quite progressive, and
his toreign policy should be to the liking
of most of us....iiis record and his pos—
tures are commendable. But when you
begin to measure up the periormance, the
accomplishment of it, there’s little to show.

. . This is signiiicant. it’s pretty clear
that this next election is going to produce
a Democratic Congress.

SKtB: Ed Muskie is not noted for beinga
really vigorous legislative leader. Would
he, or McGovern, who has the same problem,
be able to put through programs that Nixon
hasn’t. There is an alliance not only of
Republicans but of Southern Democrats
blocking him.

Hottois: Well, of course, there again you
come back to the problem that has tradi-
tionally plagued Presidents. The only Presi-
dent in recent history that one can think of
since FDR who has been a vigorous legis»
lative leader was Lyndon Johnson, whovlhen
he was dealing with domestic legislation was
dealing with Congress. Read Tom wicker
and you’ll discover rather quickly how un-
successful JFK was with Congress. Probab-
ly the thing that made him at all successful
with Congress was the fact that he had Lyn-
don Johnson to help him out a little, Nixon
has blown it on several occasions with Con—
grass in terms at start work with Congress.
i don't think you can expect a good legisla-
tive leader to arrive in the White House
very often and l'm not sure you want that.

Gilmour: Don’t give Lyndon Johnson too
much credit, because if it hadn’t been for
the landslide victory in 1961 he would not
have had a majority of Northern Democrats.
You'll notice that after ’66 he got in trouble
again. That 89th Congress was quite unique.
