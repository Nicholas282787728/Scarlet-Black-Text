publications include: “Finding the
Studying Lesbian Culturé,” published
in Radical Teacher, 1977, and an artir

however, has focused on the historical
precedents for philosophy underlying
feminist education.

paper entitled ”Know Thyself, Know

nonrgay people are also directly in

he a gay parent, relative, or friend.
The hotline can also be used as an in-
formation and referral service.

Several people have already Voiced
their disapproval of the hotline, claim-
ing that it will voluntarily open up
avenues of ridicule. Regardless of the
inevitable prank phone calls, the
hotline will be successful if one person
calls and feels good afterwards.

The hotline will be inservice every
Monday and Friday night from 7:00
pm. to 10:00 p.m, The office will be
located in the student activities room
and accessible to anyone needing
