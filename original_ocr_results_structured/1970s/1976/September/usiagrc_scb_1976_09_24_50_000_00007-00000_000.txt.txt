.. laryan Bowers plays the
_ ~gu|oharp He also had the ability to
feate an evening of magic and
transmit smiles to the enthuSlastic
audience who all held hands and
sang the old Carter Family
favorite “Will The Circle Be Un-
broken.” Bowers's concert last
Saturday, September 13, was one
ot the most inspired events
presented at the College.
Displaying pure mastery of the
autoharp in the first show, Bowers
played a subtle, well thought out
set of pieces. He started oft the
,{ght with an old fiddle tune,
Blackberry Blossom" and
proceeded to dazzle even the un-
trained ear. He then launched into
, .5 usual bit of tall-tale telling
hich can leave any audience
spellbound. “Hash Eating Time in
Virginia" gets longer and more
detailed every time he tells the
story, “All true, all true," Bryan
savs,

Bowers's second set was as
equally impressive as the first but
with a completely different fee].
This show was less technical and
more spiritual. i don’t believe one
hand was left untouched during
“Will The Circle Be Unbroken." At.
times some of his renditions of old
V n'dards such as “Amazing
gace" and “Goodnight Irene“

ecame a bit bawdy, but he never
lost control oi his periormance or
the audience. Particularly
,. hing was Bowers’s completely

olicited and spontaneous

 

speech on behalf of Georgia
Dcntel. Silencing the audience, he
stated, “you all have a lady here
named Georgia Dental.” The
thundering applause lasted for
several minutes until he broke in to
discuss the merits of Georgia
Dentel. one merit being that if it
weren’t for Ms, Denlel he wouldn’t
have been at Grinnell.

Bowers is much more serious
minded onstage than on None of
his “insane weirdness” shows in an
oft-stage conversation. He is a very
thoughtful and sincere performer,
which is a refreshing treat. in:
cidentally, his upcoming album on
Flying Fish Records will also be a
reireshing treat. And if you buy a
cepy, I’m sure Bowers will be
appreciative oi your purchase.

Tomorrow night is the first
Darby Gym concert or the year.
There is probably no better hand to
play in Darby than ”Asleep at the
Wheel." A recent Rolling Stone
article termed an “Asleep at the
Wheel” performance as reaching
perfection Their music is much in
the style or the Western swing oi
the late Bob Wills and the Texas
Playboys big band sound. This
hand will make your socks roll up
and down. They play boogie
woogie, country swmg, and rhythm
and blues and do it like no other
hand you’ll see, Concert time will
be 9:30 and tickets are required (if
you have a nice iriend they can
probably get in). Remember, there
ls nothing like ”live music.”

, Live music at Grinnell Jacques Brel

is alive!

by Mark Ness

Three performers (Todd London.
Mark Ncss and Nancy Ohlson!)
plus two musicians (Mark Perclani
and Ed bowell), in the cozy, ins
timate atmosphere of Arena
Theatre otter the songs ot Jacques
Brel, adapted and translated by
Eric Blau and Mort Shuman,

It sounds like a cabaret act, but
in fact is much more, it strikes
much deeper Jacques is a Belgian
born poet and singer who does; as
the title suggests, live in Paris, He
writes songs not about the con-
ventional Paris of the old cabaret
singers, but instead tries to suggest
a world or reality. ‘

Typically the two towns he
Serenades by name are Am-
sterdam and Brussels. Amsterdam
is honored with a song about an old
sailor, who celebrates the drinks
and girls of a town that is anything
but romantic, while Brussels is
typiiied in one of those jazzy little
vaudeville numbers that seem
close to Brel's heart.

The variety or Brcl is unusuali
his songs are about bulls and
death. men and women, youth and
age, These songs are impassioned
and powerful, capable of stirring
an audience almost to irenzy, but
lhey are also unusually poetic and
beautiful, suggesting not only Kurt
Weill. but at times even Lennon
and McCartney in their more
lyrical vein.

“Go cry like men,” Bret has
advised, and the courageous
weepers are urged to storm the
gate. Suri-eptitious sniiners—those
who flinch at fierce emotions
deliciously indulgedemight perish
in theintensity of Brel's passion.
but hang on for sizzling “Carousel"
and “Next ” Don't let go for the
seemingly lighter moments in
“Marathon” and ”Madeleine," for
you never really know what Bret
has up his sleeve.

Dates of production are set for
September 30, October 1 and 0c
tober 2, Ticket distribution begins
September 26 at the Forum desk.

Kathe Kollwitz exhibit

The exhibit of works by Kathe
Koilwitz, on View in Scheaffer
Gallery through September 30,
sllouldnot be missed. Her etchings,
lithographs, and woodcuts are
among the finest graphic works or
this Century. The exhibit, on loan
from the Minnesota Museum of
Art. includes works from 1892
through 1534, spanning the length
of her artistic career, It is in»
lei esting to trace a changing style,
from naturalism to a form of ex
pressionism, and the thematic
continuity of her work.

Her most moving works are at
mothers and Children. A few
portray the tenderness of the
relationship“ but more often its
meaning is revealed through the
threat of death. Her preoccupation
with this theme is partially ex-
plained by the death other own son
in World War I

Death is personiried in several
etchings, it is a struggle with an

outside force. It is tragic because it
is too often the result of human
stupidity, greed, or even
carelessness (see “Run Over”),
rather than a natural, internal
occurrence. Thus the struggle with
death is related to the struggle
which is the other dominant theme
oi her work: the plight of the
working class The depictions of
demonstrators, agitators, and
conspirators, show her hope for a
political salvation.

Predictably, her political views
were a hindrance to her success
during her litetirne. Kaiser
Wllhclm ll denounced hel‘ prints as
”gutter art," but they were
exhibited nonetheless, The, Third
Remh was not as lcnient. In 1933,
her work was classified
“degenerate", she was forced to
resign from lhe Berlin Academy of
Art, and galleries were forbidden
to exhibit it.
