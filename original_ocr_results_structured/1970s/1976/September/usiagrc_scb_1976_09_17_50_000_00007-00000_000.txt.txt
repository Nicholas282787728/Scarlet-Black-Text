ociety. Freshman Gregg Ed-
wards questioned whether
changes were all that essential or
Whether it is “just a good idea to
bring up ideas for change." He also
wondered if ”a ‘White Paper’
shouldn't be introduced every few
years.” _,
Most students and faculty
seemed partially lost in some of
President Turner’s semantics. As
one student put it “Another ‘White
Paper' is needed just to explain
some of the ambiguities.” Many
people attending the meeting felt
clarity is needed to determine the
aspects of the ”White Paper”
which are most important to

Grinnell‘s future,

At the end of the Loose Hall
portion of the “White Paper”
discussion, a straw poll was taken

meeting next week. One could infer
that (Al the meeting was a
success, so repeating it would be
worthwhile (B) the meeting didn’t
accomplish what it was supposed
to, so another one is needed, (C)
the students enjoyed listening to
the quips of Professor Ken
Christiansen, (D) all of the above.
Following the meeting, as the
approximately so people, mostly
students, were leaving. several
favorable opinions could be
overheard. Comments from the
three raculty members on the
panel in charge of the discussion,
Professors Christiansen, Perri,
and Voertman, were all positive.

Despite the opening suggestion
or Perri. and the attempts by Kate
Waldo, the meeting focused on
specifics instead of general
principles. For example, the first
fifty minutes of the two-hour
meeting were spent on issues
concerned with required courses.
While the students seemed to favor
the present system of no
requirements, no consensus was
taken.

Prof. Christiansen proposed that
a poll be taken of Grinnell alumni
who attended at a time when
certain “great books” courses

 

were required, to determine the
value of such a course. Stu
Schnfield. a 1970 “non-graduate"
(there was no graduation in 1970
because of the National Student
Strike), said that all the “great
books" course did was “lower my
self esteem,” Diane Ruyifelaere,
also a Grinnell grad, countered
with a much more positive opinion
of the course. ,

The proposal to increase the
percentage of Iowa students was
the next major topic. Aldo Melitol
suggested that the problcm is not
one of distribution as much as of
lack of interaction between the
school and the rural environment.
Professor Christiansen pointed out
that in his early years at
Grinnell (Christiansen came to
Grinnell in 1955) the percentage of
Iowans was about 25-30 per cent
but although that percentage has
dwindled to 11 per cent in recent
years he saw no real difference.

The third major issue discussed
concerned the lack of trust bet
ween students and the ad
ministration. Bonnie Redlich said,
”It is a big student concern that
our input is not heard." Many
students voiced their concurrence
with this statement.

Student faculty relations were
discussed last. Many students
c led for better academic ad-
v ing and closer ties with the
faculty members. Christiansen
then put the issue in historical
perspective. He explained that at
one time, the facility had to, by
college regulations, spend a lot of
time in the dorms, but when the
profs stopped acting “in loco
parentis." the students stopped
inviting the faculty into the dorms.
He further stated that Grinnell is in
its fourteenth round of “intense
self-examination" since he has
been here. and in light of his ex-
perience. there should be specific
advice from students to faculty on
such issues as how to advise and
how to have closer contacts with
the students. “After all.” he said,
“most of us are educable."

Opened by three members of the
faculty, the Main Hall “White
Paper" discussion began with

Professors Erickson, Guroff, and
Moh an each expressing their views
on the paper. Erickson was mosuy
concerned with the fact that there
was no real mention of the tutorial
program in the paper. He felt that
the program should he maintained.

“The tutorial program has
probably improved our academic
advising program more than any
single step in the fifteen years that
l've been here," commented
Erickson,

Guroft didn’t feel that Turner‘s
paper got close to the problems. He
felt, “The first thing to start with is
not what's wrong but what’s right
and what you do not want to lose if
we start changing,” Gurofi also
stated that the President has taken
quite a radical departure from
what most faculty considers to be
appropriate.

Furthermore, Guroff said that
the faculty was told that the paper
was one of the lgngterm goals to be
discussed at length and that the
trustees would act on it sometime.
According to Guroff the issue
brought up the whole question or
the role of the trustees. In his
opinion they are the legal guar~
dians of Grinnell. However. Gurofi
warned, “The trustees are not
concerned with or privy to the

the faculty and the student body
should be wary of them."

“The whole analysis is back»
ward," stated Guroff. He said that
the underlying meaning of part of
the paper is that the problems
exist because the faculty isn’t
sensitive enough to the students’
problems. Though he felt that most
of the faculty would not object to
taking counseling workshops, he
personally would feel
comfortable doing it. He felt that a
link was suggested by the paper
which said that “curricular
tampering will make a joyous
society.“

The majority of the students
appeared to be dissatisfied with
Turner‘s proposals They felt he
didnottouch upon any of the major
problems of the college. ,

Bob Weiss felt that the ad
ministration should “emphasize
education instead of humanism."
He felt that campus life would
stimulate personal growth and
what was more important was a
greater variety of courses.

tremity of the proposals “makes

Turner and the administration.”

Much of the discussion centered
around the roles of teachers as
both advisors and counselors.
Many students expressed
dissatisfaction with their advisors,
and most were not pleased with the

llidea of having the faculty trained
las counselors. One woman said

that though she wouldn’t mind
getting advice from a teacher, she
didn't want any teacher to give her
“Kitchen table analysis."
Other proposals that were
brought up briefly were to increase
the library’s stock of materials,
dorm repair and the need to have
adequate courses and programs
for black students and women.

The Skin of Our
Teeth

Along with the many other ac-
tivities that tell us the school year
hasin fact begun. we again find the
theatre people hard at work on
their fall production, THE SKIN
OF OUR TEETH, by Thornton
Wilder, Originally thought of
during last spring’s planning for
the ’76-’77 season as Grinnell
Theatre’s nod to the bicentennial.
this American classic, first
produced in 1942, seems entirely
fi ing, title and all, for this 200th
birthday year.

The play is a comedy about
George Antrobus, his wife, and his
two children and their general
utility maid, Lily Sabina. all of
suburban Excelsior, New Jersey.
Geroge Antrobus is John Doe,
Alfred E. Newman, Everyman, or

with destiny, sometimes sour,
sometimes sweet. The Antrohuses

locusts, the ice age, the black pox.
wars, depressions, freeways, and
aerosol deodorant. They are as
durable as radiators, the stuff of
which heroes are madchheroes
and buffoons, They have survived
thousands of calamities by the skin
of their teeth.

Written in 1942, Wilder’s work
shows the inﬂuence of Oriental
theatre and the middle European
expressionists, the same inr
fluences that were at this time
affecting other world dramatists,
among them Bertolt Brecht and
the early absurdists. Indeed there
are many parallels between the
plays of Wilder, including “Our
Town” and “The Matchmaker,”
and Brecht's Epic Theatre, and the
plays that later became known as
“absurd."

The cast of dozens includes John
Dehacher, Nancy Ohlson, Todd
London, and Susan Hecklnan as
the Antrobus family and Rima
Miller as Sabina Others are John
Rensenhouse, David Hoopes, Scott
Schmidt, David Kappe, Mark
Ness, Julie Cooperrider, Carrie
Hall, Stuart Butziers, Mitch
Putlack, Newton White, Joan
Tuttle, Risa Gerson, Christine
Leitlinger, Amy Heavenrich,
Miriam Must, and Tom Lowbenr

Homer, Nathan Harris as a

Sandy Moffett, director, plans
to make use of video and films, as
well as collapsing walls in the
production. The play opens in
Roberts Theatre Oct. 14 Continuing
through the 15th and isth.
