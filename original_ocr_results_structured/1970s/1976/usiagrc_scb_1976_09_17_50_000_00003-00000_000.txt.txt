Marjorie Margolies Mezvinsky is
a journalist, an author, a
correspondent ior an NBC affiliate.
an adoptive single parent, a
feminist, the spouse of a US.
Congressman, and an independent
human being.

Ms. Margolies was on campus
this past Saturdayitalking to
students about journalism and
sharing her witty insights on
topics as varied as the Secret

rvice~“ihey’re all Ken dolls,
traight and clean and brave“—to
'the changing role of political
wives.

Around the lunch table Ms.

.Xiargolies regaled her listeners
ﬁvith stories of her two adopted
daughters, whom she describes as
“flowers”. A few years ago she
became the adoptive mother of a
six year old Korean girl and a six
year old Vietnamese-American
girl, It was her oldest daughter
(now eight years old) who ap
proached Mayor Daley at the'
Democratic Convention this year
to ask him about the 1968 Chicago
riot. (it was a fellow junior
reporter who wrote an ac-
companying story about how the
Mayor’s neck turned red when the

Gounger Margolies brought up the
'ubject of 1968). Daley’s response

is now famous: “It was all a

mediarhype

..is. Margolies’ youngest daughter,
cqually independent, iS charaCr
lerized as having “unique
leadership qualities . had she
remained on the streets in Vietnam
she would have been a madam, not
just a prostitute."

0n the subiect oi women and

careers, Ms. ‘ Margolies observes
that “women have an incredibly
difficult time getting back into the
labor force (after a leave of abs

sence to raise a iamily, ior
’xample). The job market is tight
and is run by men. Men have to
support iamilies. While business
and education do not employ many
women, politics in fact is em-
/ oylng more and more women.
The real inequity is that a man has
the right to have a family and a
career, but a woman is only
allowed to have a family."
Speaking to the problems of
working mothers, Ms. Margolies
remarked, “It’s difficult to put
all the pieces together as a working
woman and a mother " She then
detailed the logistics involved in
coordinating the iour difierent
. ” hedules of her iamily.
.,_ Describing marriage as “a
vyomb thing” she advises later
,marriages at which time the he
, ividual’s emotional being is more
complete, ”when you know who
you are and where you’re going."
Ms Margohes met her husband.
Ed Mezvinskv. when she was in-
terviewing him on Capitol Hill, in
much the same way Jacqueline
Bouvier met Jack Kennedy,
although she is quick to point out
that the similarity ends there. Her
recently acquired role as a
political wife poses new problems
to be resolved. “Until now the
poli cal wife was clearly in the
dew of her husband, She was

is her own person But in recent
years there has been a real change
in acceptance oi what a wife, and a
political wife can be. li the
Ah sband is as busy as a policitian
l ally is, its essential that the
e have her own career and
outside interests. i wouldn’t have
moved to Washington, DC. (from
New York City) ii i hadn't Rotten
the job i wanted.”
Ms. Margolies’ job with a
Washingtonrbased NBC affiliate
includes “0n the street” broad-
casting as well as occasional an-
choring of thevnews broadcasts. In
light of her journalistic career, her

position in her husband’s
reelection campaign is unusual, “i
asked NBC to clarify my position
regarding this, As a human being 1
can be political. But as a journalist
I cannot campaign for Ed. Aer
tually I find this arrangement
much more pleasant.” Regarding
the issue of possible conﬂict oi
interest recently brought up in the
Marion Javits case, Ms. Margolies
maintains that “ii there is no
clearly defined conﬂict of interest
then a political wtfe ought to be
able to keep her Job, in my case
there could be a conﬂict between
Ed’s and my careers and we have
to be Very careful, I will not utilize
information in my job that 1 am
privy to simply because my
husband is a congressman, and
visa versa it’s something society
has to get used to, and Will."

This year’s Presidential race
was touched on brieﬂy, “At iirst l
was dubious oi Carter and won-
dered about his openness. But his
record as governor clearly shows
he's done a good job, I'm imr
pressed also by the fact that he's
not afraid to surround himself with
good people and good advisors; he
doesn't have any ego problems,
There are an awfully lot of
politicians who are so insecure
they don’t want to show up their
weaknesses in the light of the top
level men they surround them-
selves with, I’d also like to see
Carter win so Congress can put its
money where its mouth is.”

When asked about the integrity of
politicians, in light of the many
recent scandals on the Hill, she
commented, “There is a lot of
frustration. Our system oi
government is hard to run. A
democracy has so many avenues of
input to be considered. Most of the
politicians l know do work inr
credibly hard At a given hour Ed
may have four diiferent committee

meetings to be in, all at once
There is a great deal oi integrity in
Washington, although Fanne Foxe,
Elizabeth Ray, et. al. would have
you believe it’s all a lot of power
tripping "

Ms. Margolies is also the author
of They Came To Stay
which deals with a topic of
great concern to her, adoption, and
more speclically the experience of
being a single parent," I was
working on a story about ”hard to
place” kids. Because oi race,
handicap, or age these kids were
being left in orphanages. For one
thing. I was shocked that this
culture places such an emphasis on
youth that a child of six was con»
sidered “too old” to place i
decided to adopt for very seliish,
altruistic motives it was just a
very good experience for me as a
person. I've grown tremendously
as a result of becoming a parent~l
can understand rage, anguish, and
love. I‘d like to do it again,” EXr
pressing a desire to work in the
area of adoption she holds the view
that “Adoption is not for
everybody, especially single
parents, Mal'e single parents are
very rare—part oi this is due to the
agencies. They are very set in their
ways. When I set out to adopt a few
years ago. it took over 100 hours oi
phoning beiore they'd even talk to
me, Agencies are very airaid of
homosexuality with single
parents.” Although she feels that
the best kind of i home is the two
parent version, she maintains that
“the single parent home is cer-
tainly preterable to an orphanage,
1 think single parents can do a
service to the community by taking
these hard to place Children,”
Promising to return in the future
Ms, Margolies also mentioned that
she would try to bring
Congressman Mezvinsky next time

Back to nature

(or falling in love with life in a teepee)

by Dachick

“In dwelling be close to the
land." In 584 BC, the Chinese
philosopher Lao Tsu ofiered this
advice Today, 2500 years later,
sophomore Jim Garst, a native oi
Coon Rapids, 1a., is taking the
advice by setting up residence in a
homemade lndian teepee located
just north of the physical plant
along the railroad tracks.

A fascinating sight, the teepee
irame consists of 17 20.25 ft. long
spruce poles Fastened around the
frame are several strips of canvas
oft, wide and 135 yds. long, all sewn
together by hand. Fifteen stakes
keep the canvas intact The entire
Construction required 200,300 hours
oi labor.

Jim first entertained the idea Di

life in a teepee while visiting a
friend in the Connecticut River
Valley oi Vermont who had
likewise simulated lndian lite.
After spending iour days last
winter and six weeks of the sum-
mer in his friends teepee, he
decided to get started on one oi his
own,
”i iell in love with liie in a
teepee it's a very peaceful
existence. Beyond that it‘s a hard
ieeling to describe. You really
have to be there," commented
Garst.

Citing some advantages, Garst
said, “The teepee is inexpensive,
comfortable, transportable,
peaceful, and private.”

Problems Jim foresees are few,
but by no means minor. Acquiring
enough wood for the fire will be

difficult, as will be keeping his

belongings safe. Just last weekend
he was burglarized and the
possibility of being vandalized is
also great.

“Ii i lived in a traditional Indian
society. 1 would have no problems.
The Indians never had to lock their
homes, They didn't interfere with
each other‘s property. However, i
live in an urban society and the
average American doesn’t care
about property other than his own.
1 feel that my home has been in;
varied," complained Jim
' Battling the winter is one task

 

about which Jim doesn't seem too
worried, He's built a makeshift
stove irom an oil drum at a total
cost of four dollars Other apr
paratus include a hand saw to cut
firewood and a down sleeping bag.

“Keeping the temperature at an
degrees all the time is not a
problem if I can out enough wood.
“Warmth is determined by the
amount of wood,” explained Jim.

According to Jim, only a tornado
can destroy the teepee. With the
combined weight of the spruce
poles at 400 pounds and all an-
chored by the 15stakes, he feels the
teepee is well able to withstand
high winds.

Considering anthropology is his
major. Jim feels that this is an
appropriate project, However. his
purpose in living in the teepee
transcends academics.

“Through the teepee I am able to
express my own ability to use my
hands. It is a form of my own ex-
pression," Jim pointed out.

Although he eats at the college
food service, in essence, Jim lives
oii the land. Together with his dog
Saffron. he is virtually surrounded
on all sides by nature. This
isolation reflects his ecological
philosophy,

“I'm trying to live in an hare
monious situation with my en
vironment. I Want to leave it as
pure as it was when I came,”
related Jim.

Besides living in harmony with
nature, Jim must live in harmony
with the elderly farmer on whose
land his teepee rests. Although Jim
doesn't pay rent, the iarmer,
Grinnell Dunham, asks that Garst
lend a hand with the more difficult
jobs such as bailing hay.

Philanthropist is a good term
with which to define Jim Garst. He
pursues harmony in all his
relationships whether they involve
nature or mankind. Dwelling in a
teepee and enduring countless
hardships cxempliiy his per-
sistence in living his philosophy of
harmony with his peers and what
he cails “communion' with

'nature." '
