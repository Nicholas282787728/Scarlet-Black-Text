Dear Mr. Turner:

Several Grinnellians have
contacted me recently expressing
their concern and indignation over
your plan ior administrative
reorganization which has resulted
in the dismissal of three women
irom your staii

These dismissals coupled with
your reiusal to adopt an at

iirmative action plan and the
absence oi any mention oi the
problems oi women in the GI'Inncll
College community in your
“Position Paper on the Future"
leads me to believe that there is
indeed cause ior deep concern
about the status oi women at
Grinnell.

General expressions oi “good
will" are not enough. This ”good
will” needs to be translated into
affirmativeinot negativei
actions As a ieniinist who is also a
Grinnell College supporter and
graduate, I would be interested in
knowing what speciiic steps you
plan to improve the status oi
women at Grinnell. Louise .\‘tlilli

Parent wonders about
job security and faculty

To the Editor: Aiiy parent oi a
Grinnell student tl have twol may
well he distressed to read about
what is currently happening at
Grinnell. hi this regard. I would
like to make two observations

1 When i was an editor with The
New York World-Telegram 15
years an I began tearing for the
security oi my iamily. Beiore the
World'relegram tolded, l yoincd
The New York Times. where I an
now protected by the reasonable
life expectancy oi The Titties and a
newspaper ’ guild contract that‘
prevents my dismissal at the whim
oi any new bureaucrat who is
hired. I think I am a talented
editor, but I amisz years old and I
have iour children and I would not
think oi working where I did not
have “tenture.” And I can un-
derstand why a college that will not
provide security ior its iaculty will
not attract a iaculty that deserves

security,

2 Earlylhisyearlspentabout to
da s, including two weekends, at
c nell. l kept wandering around
thinking “The crinnell iaeulty is
alive and well . l' but i could
never complete the statement
because i never saw the taculty i
never saw proiessors talking \‘lilh
students on the campus. I saw no
proiessors at weekend concerts or
movies, I saw iew preiessors at the
basketball games. And in the
student union I saw only arregular
group oi iaculty members who had
their eoilee together without
contact with the other tables i
wondered about the attractions in
the Grinnell area that kept the
iaeulty oil the campus except for
classes And I wondered what the
college must miss by having a
iaculty whose interests were so
clearly dilierent iroin those oi the
students Sincerely, tiny Warner

To the Editor: lwant to pass along
some advice which I feel can be of
great beneiit to the present
Grinnell student body

Today in the United States \\e
are faced with a period of difficult
employment, You're probably all
aware of this. It is predicted that
over a quarter oi a million college
graduates will be underemployed
or unemployed next year Ralher
dismal statistics Under such
circumstances, it is essential that
today’s college studentsi
particularly those in liberal arts
collegesibe as prepared as
possible to enter the world oi work
knowmg what they have to otter.

This means not just knowing
your subject matter iiell. It also
means knowing how to prepare
yourseli ior the change, how to
prepare the necessary tools, how to
break into the network oi contacts
which provides over eighty per
cent oi the jobs tonly about 20 per
cent of all Jobs are advertisedll,
and how to sell yourscli to
prospective employers

The Careeer Services oiiice on
the Crime]! campus is extremely
wcll~prepared to help you in these
ways and many others There you
can learn not only the above skills,
but how to use them and how to
decide ior yourseli where you want
to use them,

Take some time to visit the
otiice, Talk with John Adams or
the others there to help Sign up tor
a Career-LiterPlanning Workshop
and some oi the others. Start
preparing NOW whether you are a
senior or an undergraduate. It's
important to get the kind of in»
iormation now. that will help to put
you several steps ahead oi the
competition later. come job-hunt
time. Those several steps will
count. l know.7Linda Gasser, ‘74.

Community
concern still

needed

To the Editor: Regardless oi the
outcome at the recent oiiering oi
part—time positions in the areas oi
booking and outdoor recreation
activity instruction, it is important
that students do not lose sight oi
the other issues stemming iroin the
administrative reorganization. We
must continue to provide rii-m
community support tor the pur-
suance oi the issues oi student
input in college decisions and at.
iirmative action We must continue
topress ior greater representation
oi women and minorities in the
administration and the iaculty,
Etieelive ailirmative action
policies and procedures require
communi y support not only ior
their initiation, but also ior their

.o. implementation.—SGJ\ cabinet

Point of view

One atop
0nd two o

by noliiu ~ieli

I am tired oi writing about the
administrative reorganization. In
the political trade it is what is
known as a “dead issue. People
are tired oi hearing about it, and
would rather go about their
business. 1 would. too However.
that is not the case As long as the
administration keeps raching into
their hat and pulling out rabbits.
students will be compelled to
respond

The most recent rabbit to spring
iorth is the oiier to reinstate his.
Dcnlel and his. hicCluskey to their
positions on a partrlimc basis This
is. in a way, a minor victory tor
students. Should hicCluskey and
Dentel accept. sociitlrrccreational
services will probably remain
pretty much the same. owing to the
competence and dedication that
they have shown in theirjobs. That
in part explains the oilcr to rehire.

in the illlvcampus mailing dated
October 22, the administration tells
us that “We have reviewed at
length the reasoning . made by
members oi the community. and
conclude that there is sullieient
possibility that there will be ads
verse eilects to warrant an ad
justinent in our decision." Well,
good. There is something eoni-
mendable about an administration
that is willing and open to change,
especially when that same Lids
ministration once aiiirinccl the
iinality oi its original decision
Looked at iroin another point oi
view. the decision is one step
iorward and two steps back.

This view is governed by several
assumptions. The iirst is that both
women are doing their job and
doing it well. By all rights. they
never should have been tired. And.
should that event be anticipated,
since it touches sludenls' lives so
closely. students should be con-
sulted heiorehand. This cannot be
tlveremphasized. What is at stake
here is not simply the immediate
positions, but the decisionniaking
process at Grinnell. The intent

torwotd
ope book

here is not to usurp that process
from the administration. but
rather to try to reach a consensus.
so as to avoid conﬂict in the iulure,
Uniortunatcly, it did not work out
that way. what has happened
instead is lhat two women who
never should have been tired In the
first place are now being asked to
take what is probably a large cut in
pay.

What strikes me about this whole
process is the haphazardness oi it
all i am glad to see that the ad.
ministration has “reviewed
carefully and at length.” but it
that should have happened
beforehand. 2) people shouldn‘t
suiicr salary cuts because oi ad-
tntnislralive mistakes in
judgment, and at steps must be
taken to prevent this from hap-
pening again The decision to
l‘ehli'e IS well taken. It is the
method to which i olJJecL

There has been for some limk‘
iiow talk of a credibility gap and a
lack oi trust as regards the ad
ministration. In their defense. l
think it is fair tosay that this is not
deliberate That is. the ad-
niinistratinn is not consciously
trying to shatt the student body
They have a iob to do like
everybody else. and surely it is to
their advantage to avoid |Inr
necessary antagonism What
happened was a mistake. an
oversight in both setting oi
priorities and gauging lhe student
reaction The rehiring oi Dome]
and McCluskey is one step towards
rectitying that mistake; the
restoration of their jobs to their
original status has yet to be done.
The third step, the most important
one in the long range. is to insure
that the decistonrlnaking process is
not as autonomous as it has been in
the past

[I may be necessary, then. to
beat on a seemingly dead horse ior
awhile, but tenaciousness has its
merits; it beats having rabbits

 

pulled out oi the hat on us ior the
next several years.

Pie Face Grinnell eats it
