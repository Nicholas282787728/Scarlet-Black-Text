Q Arms and the Man is not major
Shaw, but it is a good play lor all
that, it was written in 1894, three
years alter Shaw had been
“discovered" (“at my own
suggestion,” as he says) by the
Independent Theatre, a group
introducing the New Drama
(mainly Ibsen) to London, His first
three plays had been grim, Plays
Unpleasant he called them, Arms
and the Man, written for a West.
End theatre, not the Independent,
is light; the Comedy/has no hit
-rness, though this does not mean

' that it is not serlous,

Shaw wasa reiormer, a socialist,
and thought oi his plays as,
, titerally, propaganda tools with
g'hich to retorm society and men’s
lives; he saw his role as playwright
to overthrow conventional
morality. He distinguishes two
“orders" oi literary genius. In the
lirst order belongs only a writer
who writes “from an original
moral standpoint or his own,
thereby making his book an
original contribution to morals,
religion, and sociology, as well as
belles lettrcs.” The second order
comprises those writers who ac-
cept “the current morality and
religion readyrmade without any
ueslion as to their validity." For
haw. Shakespeare—and he had
a deep appreciation oi
Shakespeareébelonged to the
second order; Ibsen and himseli
telonged to the higher. “No

A Division of Hesse’s

Shaw’s plays: social reformers

[rontier can be marked between
drama and history or religion, or
between acting and conduct," he
writes in the preface to the volume
containing this play. On another
occasion he speaks ot the theater
(he actually calls it a churchl as a
place “where the oltener you laugh
the better, because by laughter
only can you destroy evil without
malice, and affirm good fellowship
without mawkishness" Comedy,
yes: but with a serious, even
religious, function.

We can see these assumptions at
work in Arms and the Man. The
overthrowing at current morality
is, i suppose, at work even in the
title (the opening words trom the
Aeneid) and the setting (Bulgaria
in 1885 of all places; “not at all like
anything to be seen in the west or
Europe" as Shaw writes in the
opening stage direction); the
classical and the exotic are
evoked, but the characters and
issues are straight out at Victorian
England In the opening oi the play
We get a traditional celebration of
the warrior. an attitude (which is
all it is) quickly debunked by
common sense, But this is early
Shaw (and West End Comedy), and
we find the play, iinally, at least as
much bound by current values as
exploding them, There is much
satire on romantic love and its
posturing, tor example, but
romantic love forms the very basis
of the conflictiin 13th and 19th
century literary tradition; there’s

introspective and personalized
chord voicings. According to Jan
expert and journalist Leonard
Feather, Evans “has a touch of
phenomenal gentleness, a line
iacility with the pedals tor
dynamic contrast, and most Im-
portant or all, an ability to voice
chords so ingeniously that the
placement oi the notes are
doubled, which struck sottly and
which heavily, may be tar more

classic example oi the spontaneous
