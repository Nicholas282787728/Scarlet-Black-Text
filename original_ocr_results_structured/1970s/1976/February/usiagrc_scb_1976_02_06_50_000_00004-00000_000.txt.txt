SAGA alternatives?

Though talk about the food service rolls off the tip of many
a boarder's tongue, assuring that no one will lack for con-_
versation, very little discussion about SAGA goes on bet-
ween students and administrators.

When questioned in past weeks President Turner and
Dean Walker have gushed vague statements assuring
questioners that the college is “always" looking at other food
services and is continuing to do so. Again at a meeting of the
Facilities and Food Services Subcommittee Ralph
Pomerank, director of college services, claimed that alter-
natives to SAGA are constantly being sought. However,
when pressed, Fomerank allowed that, in the last five or six
years, no representatives of other food services have visited
the campus and no alternative bids have been requested or
received

Rather appalled by the situation, committee members
recommended to Pomerank that alternative food services he
actively examined, including bringing representatives to
campus and receiving alternative bids to SAGA.

This is a much-needed recommendation and one that the
college should begin to act upon as soon as possible As was
pointed out at the committee meeting, students have
nothing to lose and everyting to gain from an exploration of
alternative contractors. If, after examing all areas, including
monetary ones, another contractor appears more desirable
than SAGA, our taste buds and tummies will be happier.
Conversation may be harder to come by, but then . . . .

If an investigation finds SAGA to be the best alternative,
we, as students, will know that the administration has tried
to do their best by us and that, though SAGA may not
measure up in many ways, itis the best possible for Grinnell.
If we know we’re stuck with SAGA, hopefully, some of us
will be willing to provide constructive criticism and aid
towards the improvement of SAGA.

The administration as well has little to lose and everything
to gain. According to Pomerank, bringing in representatives
of alternative food services would require little monetary
expenditure. A substantial number of man-hours would be
required by Pomerank and other administrators. However,
they may gain a better service for their money as well as
fewer student complaints.

Hopefully, letting SAGA know that they have not been
enthroned as a Grinnell institution will cause them to shake
enough to make a greater effort toward decent service and
food.

Unsupported inferences

by Sue Repp

So you went to Grinnell. Nobody
seems excited by the fact. Just try
dropping the name at a wild party
in L.A. or at a quiet gathering on
the Boston Commons. The reaction
is universal. “What?”

Your companions will screw up
their faces and try to remember
the name. Some folks will
associate desperately at the mere
mention of the word “Grinnell."
“A small Bible College?” they ask.
“A two year technical college?"
“isn't that related to the Maharishi
movement?”

Give up, We really donll have an
image. However, a few valiant
Grinnellians have decided to face
the obscurity issue head on.
They’ve started spreading wild
rumors about us, Some of lhemore
revolutionary image builders have
chalked pro Grinnell graffiti in
New York City subway walls The
more socially advantaged mem-
bers of this vanguard have moved
to less direct tactics Some hang
out at Harvard parties on
vacations and bring up lines like
“What do you mean you've never
heard of Grinnell?” One per
licularly innovative student when
last heard of was hard at work on a
cheap paperback novel filled with
Grinnell metaphors. if this literary
effort ever reaches fruition,
countless generations oi high
school English students may be
forced to memorize classic lines

OPEN SPACE

”We, the undersigned, petition to
encourage the hiring and
promotion of women on the
Grinnell College faculty. We
believe that [he college has not
madea sustained effort in this area
and that special recruitment ef-
forts are necessary for each open
position."

Armed with this petition, we
went to Cowles Dining Room on
January 29 at 5:15 in an attempt to
get student signatures, with the
intention of presenting the petition
to (he Executive Council, At first
reading, we were embarrassed by
the innocuousness of this petition.
However, we soon regretted its
very presence.

Although we were gratified by
many of the willing signatures and
comments of support, we were
appalled by the frequency of the
vulgar and abusive comments
aimed at both the petition and us
personally: “Any man who signs
this should be castrated ” “We do
need more women profs so the men
can get married.” ”Why are you in
college, couldn’t you rind a
husband in high school?" There
are samples oironvcrsation during

We find it outrageous that college
Students at Grinnell can exhibit
such a noticeable lack of lolcrance,
ObVlously. we could not expecl 100
per cent agreement, but ll was a
shock to discover Grinnellians

exhibiting such juvenile behavior.

Out of curiosity, and in an at
tempt to answer the legitimate
questions we received concerning
the number of female applicants
lor faculty positions, Jane Love
and Jane Horwitt approached
Dean Mary Eysenbach. She was
very helpful in describing
recruitment and interviewing
techniques. However, Dean
Eysenbach was unable to supply
the necessary statistics because
technically the college does not fall
under the auspices of Title ix of
the Affirmative Action Plan.

Dean Eysenbach assured us that
sinceii is illegal, no discrimination
exists against anyone for biological
reasons in either recruitment or
hiring. Dean Eysenbach also
added that recently Grinnell has
had a larger variety oi applicants
because of the scarcity of jobs

However, we discovered a
distinct lack of female faculty
members. or the 141 faculty
membersithat is. those who hold
the rank of lecturer, assistant,
associate. and professorilBA’d per
cent are women and 2:th per cent
are men in addition, 31 per cent oi
the faculty hold the rank of
professor, 4.5 per cent of those are
women and SH 5 per cenl are men
But, since Dean Eyscnbach insists
that there is no discrimination
against women for faculty
positions, we mustthen assume it's
the Grinnell Corn.

like ”Ramona, Could you leave
behind this idyllic radish farm, to
achieve intellectual freedom at
Grinnell?”

Regardless of these heroic efr
forts of our faithful Grinnell image
builders, we still remain an
isolated community. This
quagmire becomes even more
exasperating when we realize that
nobody has heard of the other ACM
schools. We midwesierners have
been sadly neglected. . . as far as
big names go.

There is a way to rectify the
situation. Gossip. Come now, has
anyone heard oi any wild parties at
Coe lately',7 What is the latest thing
at Macalesler? is it true What they
say about Oli men? What we need
are a few good stereotypes
followed by a healthy dose of juicy,
never-Lo-be-forgotten gossip.

Off—the-record
To the Editor:

it would appear from a recent
Open Space that student govern-
ment officials and campus media
aid and abet the administration in
presenting decisions to the
students as fails accomplis.

Brent Schondelmeyer in an Open
Space last week said lhat the only
sludenis who “knew anything”
about faculty Cuts last [all were
SGA officials and campus media
who had “private discussions offs
the-record for their benefit."

Mr. Schondelmeyer's statement
raises the question of who SGA
officials and sludéni media work
for. Why did they withhold perr
linent information from the
student body? Do student leaders
really believe that policy
discussions can ever be “off»the-

record?”

This was not a case of the media
withholding information to protect
news sources, but rather the media
helping the administration through
their silence implement 'policy.‘
The media should be reporting
policy decisions and the rationale
behind them, instead of covering
them up.

Schondelmcyer's suggestion that
students should participate in
decisions affecting their lives,
especially those concerning the
food service, is a valid one.
Perhaps that much heralded
student involvement will evolve
sooner if SGA off’ ials and the,
campus media do their jobs and do
some diligent reporting.
