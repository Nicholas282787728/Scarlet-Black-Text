Grade proposals discussed

by Jim strickler

No great issues were resolved,
but several students were able to
ask questions about the
Curriculum Committee's grade
change proposals at last Thur-
sday's Open Forum. About 75
students, many of them SGA
members. some faculty, and
several administrators showed up
for the bland, hour long meeting.

In response to student questions,
Dean Eysenbach explained the
rationale behind the proposed
changes. The institution of the
“D," she said, was proposed for
two reasons. First, there are some
students who work very hard in a
course, and do not deserve to lose
out on 4 credits, although they do
not quite achieve a level where the
instructor feels they can go on in
that area. She added that when the
”D” was given previously, only
about 273 per cent of the students
received the grade Secondly, the
lack ofa “D"grademakes the “C”
a “not iully respectable grade."
She said that there was a feeling
that a “C" included the “D” range
as well, so students felt they had to
get a “B" for a respectable grade.
In answer to the question, “will a
‘D’ grade on my transcript affect
my chances of getting into grad
school?" Dean Eysenbach obs
served that she got into grad school
with a “D” in art history.

She said that the addition of the

C+ and the 8+ was tied to the
addition of the ”D” grade to
prevent an unbalanced grading
system, It would unbalance the
grading System as a whole to have
very fine distinctions at the top end
of the scale without equivalent
distinctions at the bottom.
' The committee proposes to drop
grade point equivalents, Eysenr
bach explained, because there is no
need for them at Grinnell. She
pointed out that each grad school
assigns their own numerical values
to grades, no matter what system
Grinnell uses.

Dean Eysenbach said the
“credit—erase” option was being
introduced to encourage students
to take courses outside their area
of strength.

Jeff Bob asked if a “D-option”
had been discussed. A ”D-option"
would allow a student to accept or
reject a “D” grade Dean
Eysenbach said that this Option
had not been discussed but that it.
or any other proposal, could be
brought up at a iaculty meeting,

President Turner said he felt
that students should be more
concerned with evaluation than
with grades “The key question is
evaluation As tar as grades go,
as far as I am concerned, you can
put Greek letters or numbers, or
the alphabet, or anything on it. It's
a superior pertormance. it's a
strong pcrtormance, it’s an O K.
pertormance, it's a ‘you’ve got to
be kidding' performance. Those
are the four general categories,"

Dean Walker entered into the
discussion When Kevin Martin
asked for his Opinion on tile
proposals.

“Do you want to hear my real
opinion? My real opinion is that
I‘m very cynical about any grading
system. I’ve been through so many
grading Systems at Grinnell
College, that I suspect that. since
I’m not in the classroom right
now, I have no strong bias one way
or the other, If the faculty believes
this _is to the advantage of a
significant number of the students,
whether 2 or a or 4 per cent or
whatever it is, I think that is a
minor change in the grading
system, and if the faculty believes
it should be to the advantage of the
students. it is worth passing.”

The grading proposals will be
presented at the next regularly
scheduled faculty meeting, Which
Will he at 4:15 on Monday, October
4 in Science 171, If passed, the
proposals will go into elfect next

“White Paper”
round two

A considerably smaller group of
students attended the second round \
of “White Paper” discussions
Tuesday night than the total
number at last week‘s talks Held
in the same dorms as before.
Younkers, Cowles, Main, and
boose. the meetings again were led
by several faculty members,
R A.'s, and admlnistrators.

While the turnout was disap»
pointing, the meetings never-
theless appeared to be much more
productive than the previous ones.
Several who were present felt the
general complaining had been
expressed in the previous meetings .
and that people came with a much
more positive attitude. More
speciﬁcs were apparently hit upon
and, in general, the participants
left satisfied

In the Cowles discussion there
was a notable decllne in interest. In
contrast to the meeting held last
week, when over so people at~
tended, only three professors, one
R,A., one dean and five students
were brave enough to attend this
week’s conference.

The Cowles meeting got down to
some haSlc issues and cleared
away many of the unnecessary
tangents of the “White Paper.”
Professor Kintnei- opened the talk
with his own views on the topics of
preparing students for graduate
school. saturating Courses with
values and ethics and creating
programs to develop personality,
Kintner felt that these goals could
be accomplished through “good, -
strong, disciplinary programs."
On the topic of grad school, SGA
student Coordinator, Matt Cohen,
expressed the ieeling that some
people use Grinnell as a step-
pingstone to grad school and
aren’t here to develop their perr
sonallties.

The first major point of
discussion concerned the present
lack of involvement among
students and faculty and the
paucity of involvement students
have with other students, Most
people felt this to be a major area
of concern which was not stressed
in Turner’s “White Paper." One
student was dismayed at the lack
of community feeling at Grinnell
and saw students as being “very
introspective in class and out of
class," Although no one had any
suggestions on hoiv to create a
more involved student body. no one
seemed to support Turner's model
of addressing the problem through
a program of required classes

Another topic which was
discussed at length concerned the
majors program It was noted that

this subject, which is a concern to 1;

most students, is barely mentioned

in the “White Paper.” In referenc
s s

to his freshman tutorial clas
Professor Wellborn said, “Most of
the students would be very happy
not to have to choose a major so
early.” One upperclasswoman
agreed saying, “Iwould have loved
ltiflhadn'tdeclaredamajoryet."

Problems with the majors
program were brought out after
these statements. Klntner felt “the
independent major has been
deliberately made more difficult
than a regular major,” Matt Cohen

noted “a lot of students commit /-

themselves to a major too early g
