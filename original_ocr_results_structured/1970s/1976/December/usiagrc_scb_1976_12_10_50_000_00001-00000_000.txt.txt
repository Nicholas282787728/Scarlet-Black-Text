Political scientist Arthur Miller

The support oi independents and
conservative Democrats for
Gerald Ford, along with a low
turnout among potential Carter
supporters, were cited by Roberts
Lecturer Arthur Miller as the
reasons that this presidential
election was so close.

Miller, a professor of political
science at the University oi

ichlgan and director of the
University's institute ior Social

Research. spoke last Friday on
”The Election of 1976: An

alysis.” He was also here for the
annual meeting at the Iowa
Association of Political Scientists,
which was held last Saturday.

in his analysis of the election,
Miller split the cxisting parties into
two groups based on their levels or

partisanship. classifying them
either strong or \\eak He also
divided the independent bloc into
two groups that lean towards the
tivoinaior parties The lindings he
presented Friday night indicate
that 16 per cent or those in-
dependents who normally lean
toward the Democratic Party and
24 per cent of the “weak”
Democrats voted ior Ford.

Miller also mentioned low voter
lul‘nout as another reason for the
close race. Although the turnout or
registered voters increased this
election, only 53 per cent oi the
eligible electorate actually voted
This, according to Miller, is the
second lowest voter turnout in
modern history. surpassed only by
the 1948 Dewey-Truman election.

The reason this low turnout had an
impact, Miller said, was because
those who did not vote favored
eartci- by a 4 to 3 margin,

In analyzmg why the vote broke
down in this fashion, l\Illlcr came
up with some interesting perr
speciives on the issues oi the
campaign, and their coverage tor
lack of coveraget by the media.

The Democrats' major issue. the
economv. was not their best issue,
according to Miller. Over the
summer and into the fall, he said.
the mood of the nation about the
economy changed iroin “being
relativly pessimistic to relatively
optimistic " By election day, he
stated, "the thunder had been
stolen from Democrats’ prime
issue ” At that time, only 27 per
cent of the electorate felt that
Ford's administration was doing a
bad ~lob \\’lth ilillation. Sixty-one
Der ccnt fell that the government
was doing a iair job, and people in
this group iavored Ford 4-1 to 39 per
cent

Despite what the media had said
about ti lack oi trust among the
people tor Carter, Miller said that
personal trust or the candidate was
not a major iactor In this election
sixtytwo pcr cent oi those polled
tell that they could trust Carter, a
figure it‘hlcli surprised Miller
because the media had been saying
the electorate did not trust him. He
iound that “there was a high
degree oi respect and regard ior
the candidates, contrary to what
the media said ”

Furthermore, despite what
Miller Iell “as undue attention
payed by the media to non-issues
like the Playboy interview, the
public did perceive incaningiul
differences on the issues between
the two candidates He cited
statistics that showed that 62 per
cent thought Carter was liberal
and as per cent thought Ford was a

Women’s rights:

gaining momentum at Grinnell

by Mary Brandt

Interest in the issue of civil
rights, Specifically affirmative
action, is gaining momentum in
Grinnell The invitation extended
to alumna Louise Rosenfield Noun,
‘29, to aid in the establishment of a
NOW chapter ln Grilincll is one
indicator. Although women‘s
rights were not specifically
mentioned in the White Paper, the
topic of affirmative action
assumed primary importance in
alumnieiacultyssludent discussions
this past semester, ‘

weekends were a unique ops
portunity ior alumni to contribute
to the ongomg, current and future
policymaking process of the
College. President Turner's stated

There doesn’t seem to be any real
understanding on the part oi the
administration of affirmative
actlon. There seems to be a kind of
smugness that these things will
pass and Grinnell Will be Grinnell.
They are throwing up a bunch ot
smoke screens to cover their
tracks, The reference to AAUP

procedures that the administration
is making is just backing and
filling, The point is that the College
can drag up AAUP guidelines at
their convenience."

Kathryn Buck, ‘68, team teacher
and consultant to the Department

University, expressed similar

The College's invoking of the

by Dave Wick
‘ Attended by six administrators
and approximately so students, the
last oi iour visits to Grinnell by
Dober and Associates, the firm

now studying possible living
condition overhauls, proved to be a
search for student opinions on
seven recommended areas of
improvement, Held in Main Hall
Lounge on Tuesday night, the
meeting was visually enriched by
various Dober charts and
diagrams illustrating proposed
building changes.

The first recommended Dober
change dealt with four different
solutions to threeeroom triples
which would entail the combining
oi two triples to create various
combinations of doubles and
singles. Most oi the students
present were in iavor oi
rearranging some triples but not
all Afewstudents commented that
they are pleased with the triples as
they are now

“I don‘t like seeing more doubles
at the expense oi singles, which

was mainmined by one of the
plans," said John Burrows. “I
liked the plan that maintained a
desirable number of singles.”

Concerning Mears Hall, the
second proposal dealt With con-
structlng an exit at the north end oi
the building which would require
either the removal oia room or the
mini coop.

Rearrangement of the space in
Gates-Rawson towels was the
subject oi the third proposal.
Dober suggested creating three
doubles and two Singles with a
central bathroom and kitchen,
Kent Ramsey, present resident oi
the towers. complained that there
is not sufficient room fur the
proposed changes. According to
Ramsey. the existing situation
should simply be improved rather
than altered.

Citing other problems, Ramsey
said, “The tower needs a
bathroom. The existing bathroom
doesn‘t have any windows so there
is no Ventilation. One of these
