of grading discussed

Jim Freeman

Early last week the members of
the Curriculum Committee learned
that the Academic Standing
Committee had considered
changes in the grading system and
had a proposal ready for the
Consideration of the Curriculum
Committee The procedure by
which this proposal was brought to
the attention of the students was
discussed last week in the 58th, but
the substanttve questions about the
proposal have not been adequately
discussed among students.

There are essentially four dif-
ferent questions on grading which I
feel must be addressed. They are:
l) the addition of a “D” grade, 2)
the addition oi a gradeerase op-
tion, 3) the elimination of
numerical equivalents to letter
grades. and 4) the addition of a “B-
plus” and a “Crplus” grade. Before
these questions can be addressed,
however, the purpose at grades
with respect to a Grinnell
education must be ascertained.

it is commonly agreed that
grades are a necessary evil which
Would gladly be eliminated in a
utopian society. A student should
come to Grinnelt not tor the pure
pose of earning a particular level
or grade achievement, but to
become educated, i.e , the process
ot exposure to a variety oi thought
processes and factual iniormation
coupled with the development ot a
critical ability to compare and
evaluate arguments and ideas. In
this process, grades provide aha
solutely no service. What grades do
is to indicate to an outside ob

server a student‘s mastery of a
course’s conceptual basis. They
are determined according to the
subjective judgment of a professor
who is hopeiully using generally
accepted signs oi achievement as a
basis for hIsnher judgement.
Grades, therefore, are not a goal ot
the institution: they are an ins
ternally necessitated means of
evaluating a student's
achievement toward the goal of
”becoming educated." When
grades become more important
than an education, the priorities of
Grinnell have truly becomc per-
verled.

Using the above conceptual
iramework, it is clear why the
addition of the “D" is necessary. If
a student takes a course and works
very hard, but is unable ,to grasp
the basic concepts at the course,
should this Student be penalized by
the loss of four credits? Since a
student can get into academic
problems by losing just eight
credits in four years, the failure of
even one course can be signiﬁcant
The results of incurring such
problems can be academic
probation, tor example, which
means a student is facing possible
expulsion, the loss of financial aid,
summer school. or another
semester at Grinnell. All these

rmean money Theretore, this

student is forced by the school to be
more conscious of taking courses
for grades than for educative
purposes. This is a perversion ot
the whole purpose of the school.
This student should be allowed to
have the right to get a “D” and
tour credits.

It has been argued that a “D"
would hurt other studentsi
particularly those interested in
graduate school—by making other
grades harder to get, and by
lowering gradepoint averages, I do
not believe that a ”D" will
signiticantly affect other grades,
When Grinnell last had a “D"
grade, only two per cent oI the
grades given were ”D‘s" and most
of those wcl‘c in mathematics and
the other science departments, In
addition. if a student's major
concern is the grade to be received,

that student shouldn't even be at
Grinnell. This college's major
concern should be education, as
previously stated.

With respcct to the student
proposal to reinstate credit-erase,
ldo not feel that sufficient benefit
would result from this change and,
ill addition, I do not think the
faculty would pass such a proposal
Two different philosophies of
grading should never be combined
into one system unless the beneiit
of this action is quite clear. since
this usually results in the poor
aspects oi each philosophy being
emphasized, It is generally ac»
eepted that graduate schools lend
to either ignore a credit grade or
count it as a “C.” As a result,
students interested in graduate
school tend to be advised not to
take courses for Crediterase. If the
graduate school is disinterested in
the grade {or a course, why should
a student be concerned with a
recorded grade" For students not
concerned with gradepoints, they
would rather take a course for a
grade if the ”D" is reinstated.
because Credit is defined as “C” or
above

The third question deserves
more attention than it has
received. The major argument tor
the retention of the number
equivalents is that they enable a
student to keep track oi their
“gradcpoint” to see “how they are
doing,” Personally, I feel this
really is absurd, but the dropping
of the numbers does not take the
right ot a student to calculate a
gradepoint away from that
student All this student needs is to
aSSign numbers to the grades and
use a calculator, It is my con-
tention that. the above attitude is
the very reason to eliminate
numbers. as they make students
too concerned with grades when
they should be concerned with
what they are learning, It is also
argued that numbers are needed
for graduate schools and
organizations like Phi Beta Kappa,
but these organizations can use
their own systems to quantify
grades and often (lo, To the best oi
my knowledge, ci-innell does not

even use numerical equivalents on
otticial transcripts. PreViously,
gradcpninl averages have been
used to determinehonors students.
However, recent Curriculum
Committee discussions on honors
indicate that honors need not be
based on gradepoint averages, A
major use at the numbers is the
Dean‘s List, but since I believe
qualification for this list is
determined solely by the dean, the
elimination of numbers doesn’t
affect the dean's ability to decide
qualifications tor this list.
Thererore. number equivalents to
letter gl'adcs should be ims
incdiately dropped

I do not believe that the fourth
question is very important Those
that are pro “plus" grades argue
that these allow a more accurate
evalualion of work, These against
“plus” grades argue that so many
divisions of grades are eontusing,
and that students who now get an
“As” 50 per Cent of the time and
“B‘s" the other halt, would get “Br
plusses" all the time under this
proposal. As many schools count a
“B-plus" as a “B.” the studenl
would get his or her grades
ouantitied to a lower number under
the new system rather than the old
system used by graduate schoolsl
ieel that as long as numerical
equivalents are dropped, plus
grades should be added I would
not, however. argue this point at
length.

I do feel the students should
seriously consider these proposals.
They Should dectde where the
priorities of the school should be
and whether their views on grades
are consistent with these priorities.
In addition. if they tear the
proposal, they should consider
whether their tears, which may or
may not materialize, are more
important than the harm being
done to what is a minority of
students. Lastly, both as a student
and as :l member of the
Curriculum Committee, I welcome
any student opinion on this subject
and welconic heing‘proven wrong,
it you can come up with a cone
viiicing argument I claim no
ability to be right all the lime.
