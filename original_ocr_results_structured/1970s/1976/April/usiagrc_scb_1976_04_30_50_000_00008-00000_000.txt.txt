 

JV wins twice

Late-game fate dooms varsity

by Rich Arnold

Coach John Ptitsch may invoke
the spirits. Several players are
corresponding with the Pope,
Craig zippe reads the stars
nightly. These and other attempts
to acquire superhuman aid may be
what is needed for the Grinnell
varsity baseball team to finally
win a game. Fate has dictated that
the Pioneers lose, and to date Fate
has been more successiul than the
spirits, stars, and Pope combined.

The Pioneers dropped a
doubleheader with Graceland last
Thursday, 1072 and 6-5, and
Tuesday the Statesmen oi William
Penn blasted them, 12-2. The JV,
however, won its second game of
the season, deieating Penn, 6-5,
behind the strong arms at Todd
Kiicera and Dave Wick.

The Graceland games were
ramiliar scenes: late inning
collapses, The Pioneers led the
tirst contest until the sixth inning
when Graceland exploded ior 9
runs, Wick had held Graceland to
four hits and one run over the tirst
live innings. .

Zippe started the game for
Grin_nell,_as he often does, with a
ringing single. Brian Kelly hunted
him to second and John l-laigh
drove him home with a single,
Atter Haigh advanced to third on a
poorly executed pick—off attempt,
Charlie Gogel scored him with a

single, the third hit or the inning
and [he final one of the game for
the Pioneers. The Grinnell bats
were humming silently in this
game!

The second Graceland game was
tough to lose because the Pioneers
grabbed the lead in the late ins
nings, but gave up the‘ tying and
winning runs in the final stanza.
Grlnnell used three pitchers in the
game, Gogel, l-laigh and Bob
Meyer, and all pitched well enough
to keep the team in the game. but
fielding lapses in the seventh cost
Grinncll the win

Haigh and Zippe combined to
produce a run in the first inning
and Meyer doubled home Paul
Crane in the sixth to send Grinnell
into the seventh trailing 4-2. In the
seventh the Pioneers nabbed three
runs thanks to clutch hitting by
Paul Crane, Gogel and Zippe.

Leading 5V4, Haigh got two outs
in the seventh, but also gave up two
singles to put runners on first and
second, A routine grounder led to a
throwing error and a run, and the
next batter singled to push home
the ivinning tally.

The Pioneers pounded out seven
hits in the game including two
apiece off the bats of Crane and
Meyer.

Against Penn, the Pioneer bats
were dead and so were the Pioneer
pitching arms. Grinnell collected

Trackmen stumble“

The Grinnell men’s track team
finished in last place in a field of
five at the Central Invitational at
Fella last Thursday. Central won
their ow'rl meet and was followed
by William Penn, Simpson,
Wartburg, and Grinnell. Lincoln
Marshall paced the Pioneers.
finishing second in the long jump
and fourth in the triple jump. Mike
Nadalsky was third in the triple
jump and fourth in the long jump.

Dave Leech’s efforts were good
for a fourth place in the discus
throw and a fifth place in the shot
put. Grinnell took fourth and fifth
in the lanyard dash on runs by
Glenton Davis and Mark Elan»
chard. Ken Green crossed the line
fifth in the IUD-yard dash, as did
Mark Alexander in the saﬂayard
run. Bill Brown finished the threes
mile run in third place.

Considering that thé Pioneers
placed third in a meet of the same

teams a week earlier, it. would be
natural to assume Coach Mo Hunt
would be disappointed with his
team. “But I'm not." he said. ”I
expected that." However, Hunt
added. “If we don’t do well
Saturday tat the Kohawk Inv

disappointed” I'
So far, according to Hunt. he
team is still not as strong as it
could be, but it does have potential.
“We still just lack that depth you
need," Hunt commented, “and in-
field events (Leech. Marshall 'd
Nadalsky), Brown, and Davis
scoring most of our points.”
Refering to the team as a whole,
Hunt said, “There is a lot of
potential there; we just aren't
scratching the suriace of what we
can do." Potential seems to be the
key word [or Hunt's Pioneers, but,
as Hunt's colleague Ron Mitchell
has said. “Potential is great, but
perrormance is better."

Duffers in big tourney‘

by Bob Meyer

Last weekend, the four
representatives at the Pioneer golr
team traveled to Des Moines to
compete in the Drake Invitational
Tournament. This tournament,
which is a part of the Drake
Relays, attracts most of the large
universities in the Midwest.

It was quite an honor for this
small liberal arts college to be
invited to compete in such a
prestigous event. The squad
finished last out of 16 teams, but
Coach Edd Bowers didn't expect
the Pioneers to finish among the
leaders. His main intention was to
allow the young Grinnell team to
acquire a lot ot valuable com»
petitive experience.

Last Tuesday, the team took part
in the Iowa Invitational Tour-
nament. Nobody knew what to
expect from the Grinnell golfers,
considering that they had arisen at
such an early hour that day, which
was the morning after skip day.
The Grinnell team finished six-
teenth out of twentyrtwo teams.

Sophomore Mike Hopkins
finished first for the Pioneer team
with rounds of 82-79 for a respec:

table total of lol. Sophomore 13‘»
Vanderpool and freshmen Nat
Kaplan and Frank Halley finished
with the respective totals of 163,”?!
and 177. Bowers had hoped that the
Pioneers would finish eight to in
strokes better, but the outcome of
the tournament still pleased him.

The squad continues its busy
schedule by leaving tonight for a
match tomorrow morning against
Knox. Next Monday, the team will
finish its travels at Rochester.
Illinois, where Carleton will be

host.
