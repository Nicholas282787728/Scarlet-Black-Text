Dear Dad:

They’ve attacked me where it
hurts. They’ve said i don’t write
good (“carelessly written”) and
that I am “mindless." Well Dad,
you and I know . . it could have
been iunnier. Harumph.
aseut it appears evident that eight
membersofthe Third World Group
missed something in my comment,

I

it appears evident that maybe
some people shouldn‘t read my
letters (they are, aiter all, per-
sonal). it appears I’ve become a
cause of the week, i believe my
college career may well be com-
plete with this new recognition. Do
lstill have to get Phi Beta Kappa to
come home?

,‘The situation, as I referred to it,
n , two components, both oi which,

ren seen in totality, are, may I be
forgiven. funny. Last September
we were asked to sign out steaks

for striking teamsters. in the
following week, we were asked to
boycott leamsters, and support
iceberg lettuce and the farm-
workers (this lettuce is, it should
be noted, shipped to grand old lowa
from California on iealnstei'
trucks).

Now it appears to me first of all
that there exists in this two-part
situation a lapse in logic This ls
where the iunny part comes in, It
looks like We, lhe upperrmiddle
class bastions of liberalism in
Grinnell, are over-extended in
trying to cover some conﬂicting
“causes," as outlined above. I find
it interesting that we insist on
ieeding “these working people"

nothing but steak Not soybeans,
vegetables, or milk. Let them eat
steak.

Well. Dad—o it’s excruciatingly
late and iinals are looming on the
horizon and I’m going to be up all

longingly at my bed. 0h, must tell
you, i went out for a study break
earlier this evening, out for a little
stroll around campus, when lo and

Some things never change

“The arguments for (relocating Iowa College in
1858 at) Grinnell emphasized ‘healthiness,
cheapness of living, opportunities for students to
obtain work and teaching, central position, absence

of temptation to squander time and money .

Flora Purim "Open Your Eyes
You Can Fly" Milestone

The cuts on this album range
from the electric sound of the 70’s,
to Flora‘s superb approach to
vocal music, More than any other
recording artist today, her work is
smooth. Her approach to vocal
music is unique in itself, Although
her songs have written words, her
voice is used as another instrument
in the recording, and the result is a
blend not found elsewhere in
contemporary jazz.

Orrin Keepnews, who produced
the album. writes, “The com-
pletion of the album itself
celebrated Flora's release from
prison . . ." and this idea is felt
throughout the album, The title
cut, “Open Your Eyes You Can
Fly," demonstrates her
exuberance both as a human being
and as an artist freshly enabled to
periorm once again.

With her on the album are some
excellent musiciansiAirto, her
husband and percussionist, George
Duke (from Frank Zappa’s
Mothers) on synthesizers, David
Amaro on guitar, Alphonso

Johnson (Weather Report's
current bassistiand Ndugu Leon
Chancellor on drums. All the
musicians are tuned in to Flora
and her sound, and the album
comes oil as pure energy. This is
Flora‘s third album, and i feel it
comes together most on the re-
vamping of an old Chick Corea
tune entitled “Sometime Ago.“
When the song was first released
by Chick, Flora and Alrto were
members of Chick’s Return To
Forever ensemble, the
arrangement of the tune on this 1p
provides a new approach rhyth-
mically and once again the song
maintains its own beauty. The
words themselves lure one into
imagery ofa world we do not know
today:

Sometime ago, I had a dream,
It was happy, it was lasting, it
was free.

And now in liie, oh can't you see
How we can make that dream
into reality.

Oh, the morning sun it was soit
and Cool,

And the evening breeze it was
warm and gold.

Then all together

Life had starled to unfold.

Sometime ago,

The next album I heard was a
tribute to Louis Armstrong by the
Thad Jones and Mel Lewis Band.
This band has been around for
quite a while, and has produced
many notable artists, among them
Dee Dee Bridgewater, an out-
standing vocalist. This album
includes Frank Foster on tenor
sax, Richard Davis on bass. Cecil
Bridgewaler on trumpet, Billy
Harper on Ienor and flute, along
with about 45 other artists. This
band has always had a particularly
explosive energy level, It is easy to
listen to and has remained popular
in New York clubs for many years.
Thad and Mel truly have main-
tained the best big band sound for
quite some time, This album is
worth picking up if you enjoy big
band arrangements, or ii you just.
want to hear 45 great musicians
producing a very big sound.

In other news, Chick Corea will
be coming to Iowa City very soon,
so keep your ears open ior ticket

No future for The Grinne/l Book?

“Will you remember today

twenty years irom now’7" queries

the obnoxious orange sign on the .

Window of The Grinnell Book oi"
iicc. The answer, quite probably, is
no (unless, oi course, you purchase
a 1976 yearbook), More important,
however, is whether or not the
option to buy a yearbook at all
alter this year will be available.
The future of The Cui'iiincll Book is
seemingly nonexistent at this
point in time, and I feel that we as

students are doing ourselves an
injustice by letting the deCIsioii of
the Student Publications and Radio
Committee (to discontinue
publication of The Gi'inllell Book
atter 1976) go uncontested

In recent years, The Gi'iiincll
Book has incurred debts, has been
oi mediocre |o poor quality, and
has not even served the purpose of
correctly identiiying students and
iaculiy, ironically enough, this
year's editorial staii is doing an
admirable job of meeting
deadlines, keeping production
costs to a minimum, and iden~
tii‘ying every recognizable face
Book sales are booming, ads and
donations have been received, and
in every respect, the 1976 Gi-iinicll
nook promises to be better than the
books oi past years,

Why, then, is there such a lack oi
interest in maintaining an editorial
staff? Do people simply lack
knowledge oi our predicament, or
is everyone afraid to commit
themselves to a wobbling cause?
Maybe Grinnell students do not
feel a need for a yearbook. i would
think. though, that the majority of
students, and especially seniors,
would like to have some permanent
record of their ”Grinnell Ex-
perience." with the discon-
tinuation of The Little Scarlet and
lilaek Book in addition to the

discontinuation of The Griiiiicii
nook aiter this year, the only way
we Will be able to picture “the best
days oi our lives" is through The
Scarlet and Black, and I question
the willingness of any newspaper
to turn their copy into photographs.

in a college community the size
and caliber of Grinnell. there are
surely responsible and capable
people who would be willing to
spend some time producing a
decent yearbook. Perhaps the
problem lies in the tact that people
are afraid to becomeinvolved in an
activity they do not already excel
ill. However, there is certainly no
competition to get positions on the
editorial staff at this time, and the
basic skills required to layout and
write copy for a publication such as
a yearbook are not difficult to
learn

The next crucial factor in
yearbook production is the budget
tor lack of budizét. as the case
seems to be). The ’76 The Grinneii
nook stall is working with an in-
credibly tight budget this year.
SGA funding for The Gl'inllell Book
is at a ni‘ scule 2 per cent oi its
total acti ty fund. This seems
rather unfair. ldo not think that a
quality yearbook can be produced
without increased iinancial sup
port from SGA, but it appears that

sun IS trying to phase The Gi'inucll
nook completely out oi the activity

budget. It would also be very useiul

to allot a certain amount of money
to the publications for the specific
purpose oi tinancing the editors
(and perhaps one or two staff
members) of The Gl'inllL‘ll Book
and The Scarlet and Black on an
expedition to a journalism
workshop oi some kind during the
summer months, This would,
perhaps. make it easier for staffs
to be trained, if editors were
certain of their own duties and
those at other staff members
bciore a new year begins with the
publications in a state of total
disorganization.

i believe also that practicum
credits should be given to people
working on publications. Salaries
are very nice indeed, but for all the
hours spent away irom the
academics some compensation
seems mandatory. Close attention
needs to be paid to the media on the
Grinnell campus at thisilime. it
student interest is not piacated and
iunds solicited. we may gradually
see less and less oi publications,
and if Gi‘innell students want to
continue having their ideas and
opinions represented we must
decide how important it is to eXr
press them.
