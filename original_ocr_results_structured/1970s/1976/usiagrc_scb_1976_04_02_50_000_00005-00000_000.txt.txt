Where else but Grinnell?

by Mary Brandt
Dear Dad:

Well sure Grinnell is worth 34,800
plus transportation. Let me give
you a little run down on the ad
vantages of what our son
President terms “this here place”
(it’s funny in the vernacular).

We at Grinnell have many
plusses, sitting out in the cornfields
as we do. For instance, even
though we spend only $193 per
student in library lunds, our
library can boast a five inch
electric eraser . . . no kidding, Dad-
0, not even UCLA has such an
item. Does any other library offer
such amenities as a hangman's
noose at finals? “This is provided
for the use and convenience of
Grinnell students. We are unable to
clean up altcr each use. Please
leave this the way you would ex
pect to find it.” As a small aside,
where else in the ACM can you find
a rusting phallic symbol to which
vestal virgins are sacrificed every
spring to the memory of the
Women’s Gym?

Dorm life offers all us products
of upper middle class upbringings
the quintessential ethnic ex
perience . when my iirst
cockroach appeared in my sink I
felt the ﬁrst thrills of identity, but

plaster chips that really brought it

Further, being in close contact
with New Yorkers provides for

Residing in a {arming come

,can now distinguish wind direction
according to smell: wind from the
south is cow manure, from the east
it’s the soybean processing plant,
wind from the west has the delicate

Academically, Grinnell is first

Back to Grinnell . . . where else
does one find wit and humor such
that when a hog carrier goes by on
the way to market everybody
jumps up and down screaming
“(here go some more Grinnell
women,” Where else can people
invite you with a poker lace to sign
out your steaks for striking
teamsters'! Has anybody at UCLA
ever thought oi taking a census ol
the homosexual population based
on the number of people wearing
blue jeans? Stanford may have
elected a male homecoming queen
but has a dog (four-legged) ever
been put up lor election to the of-

Where else can an Econ prof utter

higher unemployment rates," and
mean it. Where else does the
Sociology Department lorm a
