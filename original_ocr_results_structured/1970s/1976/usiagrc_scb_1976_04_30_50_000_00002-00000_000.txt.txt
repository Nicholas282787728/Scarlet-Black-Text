Budget passed in long meeting '2

by Tchrice

Displaying an inclination
towards lengthy procedural
debate, SGA approved its final
budget 0‘ $79,350 for the l976-77
academic year late Wednesday
night. Joint Board members
overwhelmingly passed a slightly
revised Finance Committee budget
by a 11 to 3 margin.

Hall representatives, during the
four and one half hour meeting,
passed a resolution which ape
propriated $1000 from the Major
Concerts Committee~leaving
them $19,000, and gave the money
to the Public Events Committee
which increased their total to
$8,500. The Administration’s
willingness to match one dollar {or
every two dollars of SGA monies
for Public Events, up to a
maximum of $5,0000n the College’s
part, was an important con-
sideration in the voting.

Another successful resolution
eliminated funding for New
Student Days, recommended for
$700 of support by the Finance
Committee, and divided the money

between Hall Funds and General
Budget and Reserve. Hall Funds
were increased by $460, from $4,600
to $5,060, and GB&R received an
additional $240 giving them $2,240.
It was the opinion of SGA that the
Administration should be
responsible [or the funding of New
Student Days‘ activities.

The only other budget revision
dealt with a reassessment of how
future additional income should he
prioritized Under the new
decision, some of the areas slated
to receive funding are the Major
Concerts Committee. which could
receive up to $1,000, and the
Yearbook, a lower priority, could
realize 3500 depending upon the.
amount of extra monies that come
in from increased enrollment,
interest, and pinball machines.

In other business, the Senior
Week Committee obtained $700
from SGA out of this year’s budget
in an effort to make seniors’ last
memories of Grinnell pleasant
ones. Jim Freeman, represens
tative for Main Hall, criticized the
Joint Board for the “ins

 

consistency" they exhibited by
voting for Senior Week. an?
against New Student Day '
Freeman contended that both
events have relatively similar
activities and take place when
school is not in session.

F‘reeman proposed that SGA
Treasurer Mark Nissen should
receive $25 in addition to his salary
in appreciation tor the time Nissen
contributed while performing
secretarial duties. The motion was
dropped alter inconclusive debate)

The highlight of the meeting
occurred when Russ Damtoft,
representative for Loose Hall.
announced the formation of
betting pool and for 25-cents,
representatives could attempt to
predict what time the meeting
would end. Jeii Bob, represe
tative for Loose Hall won 3.
when the meeting ended at twelve
o’clock.

Changes in the budget can be
made by the new Joint Board
within thirty days of the start of
next semester.

Pub reduces trustee debt

' by Beth Wiley
Three years ago, the Pub
borrowed $6,000 from the Board oi
Trustees to get the ball rolling
That debt has been reduced by
$3,500. This year, only $500 more
can be paid because of a $900 air-
Conditioner repair bill,
Memberships brought in 31.77
proximately 31,900 this year.
Besides general upkeep, the money
has been used to supply birthday
pitchers and pay wages to the 22
students employed by the Pub.

Because the Pub is a private ,

corporation not bound to college
rules, it is not obligated to employ
only students on financial aid, but
these people receive higher
priority,

One problem the Pub has to deal
withis the breaking and stealing oi
glasses. Pub»goers smash or walk
away with as many as 144 glasses a
