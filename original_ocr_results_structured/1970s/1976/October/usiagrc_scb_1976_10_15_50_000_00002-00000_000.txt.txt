Iowa PIRG brought this debate to the Grinnell campus because
oi the nuclear power plant proposal made by Iowa Power and Light
Company. This private utility has proposed to build a nuclear plant
in Prairie City, which is is miles southwest oi Grinnell, The power
plant, costing 1.27 billion dollars, hasn't yet been licensed by the
federal government nor approved by the Iowa Commerce Com-
mission. Sometime in 1977, the proposal will be heard by both the
Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the ice. It licensed
by both commissions, the plant’s construction will begin with
completion scheduled for 1984.

Leach brings campaign
to Grinnell

by Bob Mitchell

With a little more than two weeks
left in the campaign, it is} clear that
Republican congressional .canr
didate for Iowa‘s first district, Jim
Leach, has learned the lessons of
this political year.

His campaign, which he brought
to the campus last Wednesday,
typiiies the antirpolitican, antiv
Washington approach that this
post-Watergate year has seen
develop. Like Jimmy Carter and
Ronald Reagan, he projects an
image of the citizen politician who
wants to control a burgeoning
federal bureaucracy and reform
what he tools is a corrupt
Congress.

Leach, however, is no political
ideologue. On many issues, his
positions cross party lines. and are
quite close to incumbent Ed
Mezvinsky's. Both. for instance,
support the Equal Rights Amends
ment, and Leach is to the left (if
traditional Republicans in that he
iavors a break-up oi the oil com-
panies and is against thc
development of the B-1 bomber

His major issues, however, are
government spending and reform
ofthe federal government, and it is
in these areas that he sees lli.
sharpest disagreements with
Mezvinsky. wednesday night
Leach said that the government
has “gotten involved in
,proliicratlng obligations” and has
not considered the results of this
proliferation. He criticizes Mez~
vinsky for voting to bail New York
out of its fiscal crisis and ”virr
tually every other“ piece of tederal
spending.

Deach’s stand on government is

, in keeping with the tone of his

campaign in that he is very critical
of the way Congress has run its
aiiairs in the past several years.
Here, he cites Mezvinsky‘s voting
tor pay increases for Congressmen

 

as being typical oi an attitude of
“elitism” within Congress. He is
also critical of Mezvinsky‘s ace
ceptance of what he calls “special
interest money," which comes
primarily from unions, although
Leach also cited contributions
from the banking, tobacco. and
cable television lobbies. Leach is
not accepting any out-olrstate
contributions, except for money
that comes from the Republican
National Committee, He favors a
law that would outlaw special
interest contributions. but would
Ilso support legislation that would
'equire federal funding of
congressional campaigns.

Consistent with his outsider,
reformist approach, Leach has
attacked Mezvmsky in this cam»
paign as being someone whose
voting record in Congress does not
reflect the desires or needs of this
district. Leach cites Mezvinsky's
pro-labor record and his changing
positions on Lock and Dam No. 25
as examples of this isolation from
the district,

The great emphasis on attacking
Mezvinsky has left Leach open to
lhe charge thathe is waging a dirty
campaign Thls is a charge he
vigorously denied Wednesday
night.

“This year is a very issue
oriented year, We’re making an
issue contrast campaign, 1 would
argue thal we're running the most
positive campaign in the country,”
he said.

The effect of the antir
Washington orientation of the
Leach campaign, oi course. cannot
be fully gauged until election night,
in 1974, Leach lost by 12,000 votes,
but this year the race seems to be
Closer

Whether Leach will. in fact, be
able to attract enough voters with
his newlyadopted approach
remains to be seen

Dober
asks
students ‘i

by Trena Clcland
and Renae Reese

Study breaks were held in four
dorms Tuesday and Wednesday
nights With consultants from the
Massachusetts-based firm of
Dober and Associaties, which has
been called to Grinnell to study
dorm improvement possibilities,

To the casual onlooker, the
scenes looked somewhat like group
therapy sessions: a well-dressed ‘
man sitting in an easy chair
making notes in a little black book,
with several disheveled “patients"
sprawled on the ﬂoor around him. .

Consultant .lohn Ullberg led a5
discussion in Read on what the
firm '5 goal is, and at the same time
gathered student reactions to the
current dorm situation. The ob»
jective of the sessions, he said. was
“ . . . to develop as many sources of
information as we possibly can,
and to develop ideas from students’
perspectives."

“These meetings are intended to
bring up issues that are close to
home to the students. What we
would like to get out of this is how
these halls work in terms of social
units and study units, and wher ~
they (all short,“ he said.

The firm has been hired by the
college to systematically look at
housing, to gather available
student iniormation, and to make‘
recommendations to the College as
to current housing needs. Ullberg
outlined the “eightrpronged”
approach to the study, which
consists oi a physical plant in-
ventury, utilization 01' Student
Afiairs data, a study of public
areas of the dorms, study breaks to

.sample student opinion, pin-

pointing what makes Grinnell's
housing different from other
colleges‘, a cost analysis, idenr
tiiication of issues which migh‘
encounter opposition and need
clarification, and distribution of a
student questionnaire.

The group of over thirty students
present at the Read meeting we

few of the faults of Grinnell dorms
Some basic suggestions which
were made were to install better
soundproofing and lighting, and
generally create a more home-like
atmosphere

Another point on which the
discussion revolved was the
purpose oi the dorm—whether it is
a social unit. a place for study, or a
building strictly for sleeping and .
shelter, Senior Ned Shank com_
merited that, “It seems like the
longer you've been here, the more
the dorms become more of "‘-
shelter and less of a social unit,
