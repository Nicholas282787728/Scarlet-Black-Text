White addresses discrimination!

by Ann Staplotoii

Maude White. Director of Afr
firmalivc Action for the lowa Ci\’|l
Rights Commission, was the guest
lecturer at an affirmative action
meeting held Saturday afternoon.
October 2, in South Lounge

Ms White wanted to clear away
some misconceptions that people
have concerning aiiirmative ace
lion policies She explained al'r
iirmative action hiring practices
as simply good sound personnel
management, She said that it was
legislative action to bring certain
speciiic groups oi people who have
long been discriminated against
Into the labor market. The four
groups primarily concerned with
aiiirmative action are women,
ethnic minorities, the elderly, and
the handicapped She deiined
aiiirmative action as the attempt
to channel these people into society
as productive individuals.

Concerning the problems oi
women. Ms White said that
women have been traditionally
protected to the point of being
smothered. The rapid change in
the economic structure of our
country requires the active par-
ticipation or both sexes in the job
market Employers should, Ms,
White emphasized. be committed
to the idea oi utilizing the virtually
untapped resources of the women
of the United States.

with regard to ethnic minorities,
Ms. white ieels that management
should be attuned to affirmative
action policies in order to give

minorities such as blacks and
Chicanos a useful, productive
place in society. She does not See
.niiirmativc action as reverse
discrimination, but as a means of
bringing about a rapid change in
the United States’ traditional
discriminatory hiring practices.
“It's not how old you arc. it's
what you've done during your
lite." the sixty-three year old Ms.
White commenled, She views age
as a totally irrelevant iactor in
human relationships. She fccls thal
we are blocking oil an immensely
valuable resource when we
assume that age necessarily
debilitates people. Age is niten
used as a criteria ior hiring, she
asserted, and causes some of the
best-qualified people to be
screened out oi the job market.
Suggesting that the word

Ms. White used the example of a
deai person working in a job with a
high level of noise density, A
person with normal hearing
abilities would be lhe one hanr
dicapped in this situation.
Thereiore, it is wrong to assume
that a handicap such as blindness
or deainess will necessarily exe
clude a person irom interesting
work. She also feels that Grinnell
should be examined in terms of its
accessibility to the handicapped
