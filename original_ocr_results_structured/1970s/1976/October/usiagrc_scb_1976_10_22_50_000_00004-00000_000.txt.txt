 

CIA connection at Grinnel]?

Ed. note: This letter has received by the 5&5 this past week. At the author’s request we have printed
the full text of the letter, followed by President Turner's reply. We regret we do not have any further
background information on tho subjuctol Ms. Bevis’ concern.

Dear President Turner:

As a 1955 graduate oi Grinnel]
College. I am greatly concerned by
the possibility of covert relations
betlveen the Central Intelligence
Agency and Grinnell College.

In its final report issued in April,
the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence reported that the CIA
carries on Clandestine activities on
over we American campuses. The
Committee stated,“It is the
responsibility of private in-
stitutions and particularly the
American academic community to
set the professional and ethical
standards of its members,” As an
alumnus, Icall on you as univer
sity president to accept this
responsibility and take action to
and any secret CIA presence on
campus.

The Senate Select Committee’s
report revealed a wide range of
CIA activities which raise imp
portant questions as to the ln'
dependence and integrity of the
university. For your information, I
am enclosing a copy of the relevant
passages, which you will note were
“abridged" at the CIA‘s request.

In the past, according to the
Report, the CIA secretly funded
individual professors and even
whole departments to carry out
secret research and to otherwise
perform covert missions for the
CIA. In his Executive Order of
February 18. 1976, President Ford
gave the CIA authority to contract
{or secret research—With
knowledge of the CIA involvement
limited to “appropriate senior
officials of the academic ins
stitutions and to senior project
officials " Those officials would
presumably include you and a few
other key administrators and
professors. However, unless your
administration alerts the
university community as a whole,
lower level professors, researchers
and students may unwittingly be
enlisted to work for the CIA on
projects they would find ethically
unacceptable if they were aware of
the iunding source and the possible
application of the research. I call
upon you tomake public the past or
present existence of such secret
CIA research on campus~or
elsewhere under the university's
auspices—and make it university
policy that the true funding source
of all research be publicly iden-
tified.

 

The Senate report states that the
CIA is currently using several
hundred American academics
located on over loo campuses ior
“providing leads and, on occasion,
making introductions for in-
telligence purposes " These
professors and other university
personnel apparently are under
secret contract to the CIA and
specialize in “spotting" foreign
students who are then covertly
recruited as American intelligence
agents tahd hence become in most
cases traitors to their own coun»
trieslr Whereas open recruitment
on campus can be defended on
First Amendment grounds. the
employment of professors as spies
against their own studenlsi
whether foreign or Amel‘lcaniis a
violation not only of academic
freedom but of fundamental
notions of decency

Additionally, the Senate report
states that some of the academics
with whom ClA maintains secret
relationships “occasionally \V‘rite
books and other material to be
used for propaganda purposes
abroad.” These publications were
part of the more than 1.230 books
the Senate Committee reported
were published over the last three
decades by the ClA both in the
United States and overseas The
Center for International Studies a:
the Massachusetts Institule for
Technology was one of {he in-
stitutions identified as having
cooperated with the CIA and ac
cepted covert funds to publish
works of this sort I am sure )ou
share my objection on ethical and
professional grounds to professors
participating in such deceptive
practices.

lcall on you to make it college
policy that no employee shall
perform services of any kind for
any government agency. unless
that employee's relationships lo
the government is made a matter
of public record Within the
university.

The Senate report states that
American academics are used
abroad by the CIA for operational
purposes. In other words, socailed
professors and students overseas
are actual» intelligence
operatives under cover, According
to the Senate report. Fulbright
scholars are the only category oi
American academics abroad

exempt from use by the CIA, and
even that exemption is not com-
plete. I believe that as long as
foreigners have reason to fear that
some American academics are
secretly working for the CIA, then
all legitimate scholars traveling
and working abroad will be suspect
and potentially subject lo
limitations. The CIA has already
issued internal prohibitions
against the operational use of
accredited newsmen and
missionaries, as well as Fulbright
grantees These prohibitions
should be extended to all American
academics abroad and at home. I
call upon you to make your voice
heard in Washington for a total ban
on CIA operational use of people
associated with universities and
colleges. or of CIA operatives
representing themselves as
students. researchers, or
professors,

The university and college have

agency is another matter
altogether. It is contrary to the
openness and trust necessary for
true academic freedom. This is the
position of the American
Association of University
Professors, whose convention in
June 1976 adopted a resolution
calling for an end to the use of
academics in covert intelligence
operations. (See enclosure)

The time has come to clear the
air and to end any secret ties to the
CIA, I call upon you to sever any
such ties and to make a ilill report
on any past or present connections
between the CIA and Grinnell
College. You may have been in-
formed of some oi these cons
nectionsiif any—in your capacity
as college president Ii you do not
believe you are iully informed.
however. you might consider using
the Freedom of Iniormation Act or
a direct letter to CIA Director Bush
to obtain a listof all past or present
CIA activities on your campus. I
am sending a copy of this letter to
the student newspaper and the
alumni magazine to open up a
campus-wide debate on the
question oi CIA‘s use of the
university and college community.

the forgotten

candidate

To the editor: As an outcome of
the October 6 presidential debate
the frightening similarities of
Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford
were revealed. We saw two hawks
arguing about who would provide
the best military preparedness
to stop the Communist “threat"
throughout the world, These two
potential leaders would retain for
the U s. the policy of being
“policeman of the world." Both
these men believe in the supreme
presidency, recent examples of
which are Johnson and Nixon.

Eugene McCarthy, the other
major candidate Inow polling

around 10 per cent of the votel,
advocates a return to a con-
stitutional presidency. where in-
formation, power, and decisions
are shared. Jimmy Carter may
talk a good line when facing a
liberal audience. but when
speaking to conservative
militarists his true spirit shows.
We must not forget that Carter
wholeheartedly supported the
Vietnam War. During the debate
Carter stressed that the military
budget holds top priority, even
when compared to feeding
American citizens. He stated that
the U.S. must “continue to in-

Dear Ms. Bevis: ‘
Thank you very much ior your
letter of September 29, in wh' h
you express concern over possilﬁ
connections between Grinnel
College and the CIA. To the best of
my knowledge, neither individual
faculty members nor the ins
stitution have now or ever have
had such connections. Given the
small number of foreign students,
and the fact that we are a teaching
college with very few colleagues
engaged in research of even
remote interest to a covert in-
telligence unit, I would be
astounded at the existence of any
such connection. ‘
I would not agree that the source
of funding of all research be
publicly identified. A colleague has
the right to do research in con;
nection with whatever project Ira
she feels is justified, and need not
disclose the source of support
unless die finances or facilities of
Grinnell are involved. In these
cases, grant applications must be
approved by the College. I do not
believe as an institution we can be

.in the business of judging the

legitimacy of a research project,
or questioning the source of fun
ding when thatis a personal matter
between a colleague and another
organization or individual.

You will note that the AAUP
resolution of June 26, 1976 puts t
burden on individual academician
to be truthful about their relations
with the government. I believe this
is as it should be, and that to ask
disclosures of reasons for researt
and sources of funding in relatioi
to the government could set a
dangerous precedent, leading to

Democrats on campus scoff

at possible Ford-Leach support

To the Editor: Late last week,
various publicity purporting to be
authored by myself was
distributed around campus
regarding a supposed “Democrats
for Ford~Leach" organization I
would like to state publicly that not
only did I not have anything to do
with this unhumorous “dirty
trick," but also that the very idea
of such an organization is nothing
short of ludicrous.

Democrats, and especially
Grinncll Democrats, are four-
square opposed to virtually every
aspect of the antirpcopleipru-blg
business Ford campaign. For
Gerald Ford, the man who par-
doned Richard Nixon and who
supports an anti-abortion cons
stilulional amendment, has
compiled a record that IS a coma

plete and total anathema to the just
and humane principles the
Democratic party stands and
tights for. Moreover. Democrats
support open, strong. com-
passionate national leadership, a
far cry from Ford's record of
governance by negativism, veto,
fear and deceit, Besides, how can
any Democrat prefer to havc Bob
Dole over Fritz Mondale a heart
heat from the Presidency.
Grinnel] College has a proud
tradition of being a center for
progressive political participation
in the Midwest, Jimmy Carter is a
candidate who is well worthy of our
support: merely watching
tonight’s television debates will
prove this far better than can this
limited space Heisa man who will
provide America with executive
leadership of vision and com~

petence 'as we enter our third
cen|ury. In short, Jimmy Carter
can do what Bobby Kennedy,
George McGovern, Fred Harris,
and Mo Udall wanted to do with
their campaigns: he can make
America happen again. 1R
dynamic people’s campaign he ho,
waged proves this.
