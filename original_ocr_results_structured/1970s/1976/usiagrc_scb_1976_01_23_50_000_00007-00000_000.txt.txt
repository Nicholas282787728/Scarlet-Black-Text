The Iowa Precinct Caucuses:

an analysis on the bias

by Joseph F. Wall

Who was the winner in the Iowa
H cinct caucuses held this past
Iv ohday? Well, there were several,
but the biggest winner appears to
have been the state of Iowa. For a
brief moment, it received national

‘evision exposure that exceeded
any it had ever known before. One
hundred million Americans,
watching their favorite nightly TV
news program, learned for the first
time that the correct pronunciation
of Iowa is not 0-HI-o, or even that
alternative pronunciation favored
by some, I-da-HO. We were
courted by Reagan, Udall. Carter
and Harris; Waiter Cronkite
shiled at us; and Roger Mudd
even visited us. It was heady stuff.

This writer can remember some
t enty years ago attending a
ﬁcinct caucus in which only he,
his wife and Bob Globus, the jovial
JD restauranteur, were the only
participants. We duly elected
ﬁselves delegates to the district
vention and adjourned, No
questions were asked about which
Presidential candidate we were
supporting or whether we
represented a true cross section of
the population oi the precinct. We
didn’t even get coverage in the
Grinnell Herald-Register. But four
years ago, the national media
discovered that Iowa was the first
state in the nation to begin the
process of selecting delegates to
tr} national convention—a good
I th before that old favorite
ellwether of American politics,
New Hampshire, held its primary.
When this startling discovery was
minounced to the world, Iowans
nan turning out in droves to
attend their previously neglected
caucuses. living rooms became
crowded, friendships were made
and broken, and all in all, we have
not had so much fun since
Chautauqua folded its tents and
silently stole away. It was a press
agent’s dream.

But it was not only the iowa
Development Commission that
won last Monday night. The Iowa
mocraticv party won too. Tom
Whitney, the, state ‘ Democratic
chairman, ‘got interviewed on all
t national TV networks just as it
g'were Mayor Daley or “Bo”

a‘llaway. And never one to miss a
chance to make an easy buck,
Whitney even collected $10 a head
from pubiicitydrunk iowans to
. me in off the streets and watch

oger Mudd watching the returns.

He got a surprising number of
takers. it was a good night for the
Democratic party treasury.

It was a good night too for
Jimmy Carter. He was. to be sure,
the favorite, but no one expected
him to get twice the percentage of
his closest rival, Birch Bayh, who,
contrary to expectations. came in a
poor second. Carter, with 23 per
cent of the caucus Votes, must now
be taken seriously at the national
level. He is no longer a regional
candidate put up by the Southern
moderates as a possible check to
George Wallace's aspirations. For
the first time since Zachary Taylor
of Louisiana, who won the Whig
nomination and then was elected
President one hundred and twenty-
eight years ago, we have a viable
major party candidate from the
deep South. Carter can make the
Georgia peanut as famous as All
Landon made the Kansas sun-
ﬂower.

Fred Harris was also happy with
the night‘s work. True he received
only ten per cent of the vote, and
came in third in the race, but his
was a case of third being better
than Bayh’s second, simply
because he had been largely
ignored by the newsmakers, who
had concentrated on Carter and
Bayh. Harris's contented comment
was, “Some got winnowed out. I
got winnowed in.” Harris has been
frequently compared with
McGovern—a comparison he
obviously does not appreciate. An
analysis of his vote in this county,
however. with that of McGovern’s
caucus vote of four years ago
would support Harris’s contention
that he has a much broader base of
appeal. McGovern’s surprising
strength four years ago in this
County was heavily youth-college
Centered. McGovern in1972 carried
only the iirst ward in Grinnell,
where 200 students turned out to
swamp the caucus being held at
Professor Clotielter's home. This
year', Harris carried every ward in
Grinnell except the first ward,
where he tied With Carter. Harris
also received the plurality in the
county, getting 35 delegates to
Carter’s 34 and the uncommitted’s
33. Clearly Harris has more claim
to the populist mantle in his ability
to attract the farm and small town
vote than did McGovern. He goes
into New Hampshire with a cone
siderable boost.

It is just as important to note the
losers as it is the winners in
assessing the results of the Iowa
caucus. In addition to Bayh, Udall,
who received only a per cent of the
statewide vote, and Shriver, who
got a little over 3 per cent, must be
considered heavy losers. Locally,
Udall ran a strong third in the first
ward, and tied With Carter in the
second ward, which Harris
dominated, but he did not receive a
single delegate in the other two
wards, and got only one other
delegate in the rest of the county.
Shriver received only one delegate
in the entire county. Eunice’s
coattails were just not strong
enough.

Perhaps the biggest loser was
the Republican party. Unlike the
Democratic party. it does not
select its candidates on the basis of
Presidential preference. In an
attempt to attract some attention.
however. the GOP announced it
would conduct a straw poll in 62 out
of the 2,530 precincts in Iowa. When
the poll showed that Ford was
leading Reagan by only is votes
out oi some 500 votes sampled, the
Republicans closed shopand went
home. The result was that their
caucuses aroused about as much
excitement as one of President
Ford's speeches.

The only Republican in the state
to create any kind of stir this past
week was the irrepressible state
Attorney General, Richard Turner.
In one day, he legalized double
bottom trucks and outlawed bare
bottom massage parlors, and for
that day at least, he took the
spotlight away from the
Democrtas. If the Iowa
Republicans had any ﬂair for the
dramatic or had any sense of
humor, they would Start promoting
him as a favorite son candidate.
Happily,they have neither.

So now it’s on from the Corn
State to the Granite State. Lots of
tombstones have been quarried
there. Some Democrats must
already be seeing the engraving on
the block.

Victory belongs

to Harris

by Bob Mannheimer

The Democratic Party caucused
in Iowa last Monday to determine
delegate selections for the myriad
of presidential candidates. En-
tering the caucus, Jimmy Carter of
Georgia was predicted to win the
most number or delegates. It was
otherwise in Grinnell, In par-
ticular, the second ward caucus
meeting in Don Schild's house went
by nearly iirty per cent for the
populist candidate Fred Harris.
Harris‘s surprising support must
be attributed to the campus
organization oi students and
faculty. Udall and Carter tied in
the scramble for second place. The
uncommitted delegates finished
last. . '

The second ward turned upside
down the statewide results. The
hopeful results for Harris in the
second ward, and in Grinnell as a
whole were sustained by his state
wide showing though the victory
was not as clear as in the Grinnell
precinct. According to Joe
Genereux, the technical and ad-
ministrative director for the State
Democratic Party, Senator Birch
Bayh suffered a major setback.
Although he made a strong
showing in the Eastern part of
Iowa, he lost where labor was less
influential in the outcome.

As for Morris Udall, the race
seemingly has come to a sad end.
The rumor that Udall had in reality
always sought the Arizona Senate
seat this year has now been named
by the loss suffered Monday.
Personally, the organization effort
by national staff and the extensive
travel plans by Udall and his

family could not reverse the
'waning support. At the college,
Udall was perhaps the weakest of
the candidates who came on
campus. The establishment liberal
perhaps came to the presidential
race with qualities too similar to
McCarthy's and McGovern’s and
was cast aside.

Jimmy Carter confidently
predicted his victory, whether for
show or from sincere belief, A long
road awaits the momentarily
excited Carter campaign. Carter’s
open campaign style will suffer
from stricter security procedures
as the race progresses. The real
question for Carter, however, is
whether he personally can
withstand the mounting onslaught
of attacks by the press; Evans and
Novak and in Harper’s alleged
misrepresentations of the facts and
past political deals could haunt the
clean image oI the Carter came
paign.

In a final analysis the victory of
last Monday belongs to Fred
Harris who might very well pull
further ,upsets. :,
