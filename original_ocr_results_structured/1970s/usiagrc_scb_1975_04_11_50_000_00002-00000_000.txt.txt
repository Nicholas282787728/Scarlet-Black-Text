Counselor Grapevine Committee

refuses
offer

The alcohol counselor, Mitch
Kclber, who was expected to reside
at the college ior themonth ot April
rejected the college‘s oiier only
days aiter verbally agreeing to
accept the position. Kelber visited
the campus in early March. when
he left. Assistant Dean of Student
Affairs, Dianne Ruyilelaere, Said
that the office had a verbal
agreementthathe ivould come, but
received a letter rctusing a iew
days later.

Kelber, who is now serving as
a counselor for the state mental
hospital’s Chemical Dependency
Center in Mount Pleasant, come
merited that he couldn’t provide
what he thought the school wanted.
It appeared to Kclbcl‘ that Grinnell
wanted someone “to set up or
implement legal action” against
students who tore up dorm rooms
while drinking, A fellow classmate
of KClber’s also recommended Mt.
Pleasant as good experience which
helped change his plans.

Although Kelber was impressed
by the etiiciency oi the campus
tour and the organization of his
visit by Ruytielacre, he believed
that the college was “looking tor an
easy out that isn't there" With the
drinking problem in the iorm ot the
Judicial Council or some other
disciplinary committee. The
college has a legitimate interest in
the problem. Kclber stated, but
they don't know what they want or
what they‘re dealing with,

Students left Kelber unconvinced
that they believed an alcohol
problem existed. “It ls too lnuch
part of the social life” and a
“universal thing" for students to
view drinking as a social problem.

Student Affairs is still in Contact
with the Oakdale Center for
Alcoholism at the University of
lowa in hopes of working out
something tor next year, but it is
too late this year, Ruyitelaere
commented In the meanwhile.
information will be collected,
resource people will be sought, an
educational conference for next
year will be planned, and in-
dividual counseling will continue.

Disappointment was expressed
by Ruyffelaere that Kelber acted
unprotessionally in not contacting
any one at the college about his
misgivings.

Bureau, rather than being typed
and duplicated.

Wylie who commented, “We have
attempted to leave all editorial
Comment in the introduction. The
course evaluations themselves are
simply distillations oi the written
statements oi the students in the
Course. Hopefully, this will make
the book more useful as a tool of
both students and faculty,”

ties on
course

The Curriculum Committee met
Thurs, Apr. 3, to discuss a
proposal for an interdisciplinary
course in the Humanities and
Social Studies Divisions. The
course was proposed by history
protessor Philip Kintner, who was
present at the meeting, According
to Klntner, the course would be a
careful study of primary sources
relevant to continental Europe
from the Middle Ages to modern
times

Following a lengthy 2-hour
discussion, which primarily ex»
plored the signiiicance oi the
course in relation to departments
other than history in the two
divisions, the committee voted four
in iavor and tour against approval.
An important iactor in the voting
was the fact that the staffing plans
outlined in the proposal submitted
to the Humanities and Social
Studies Divisions differed from
those presented to the Curriculum
Committee. The course, as
proposed to the Curriculum
Committee, would have three
sections with each section being
taught by a team or two teachers
