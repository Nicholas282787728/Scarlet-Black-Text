The recently distributed
proposals to introduce the ”D”
grade, eliminate numerical
equivalents [or letter grades, and
introduce a “Credit-Erase” option
provides a unique opportunity for
the student body to express itself
and hopeiully to influence the
decision to be made by the Faculty
next month regarding this
proposal. The issues involved with
the various proposals are in some
ways complex and in many ways
ambiguous. This article seeks to
clarify some oi the issues, in the
hope that students will be able to
make a more informed judgement
when they vote on these proposals
at the hall meetings scheduled for
this Sunday The Curriculum
Committee Proposal will be used
as the basis for this discussion,’
with the comments and concerns of
the Academic Standing Committee
incorporated in the course of the
discussion.

Upon the request of the Math
Department, the Curriculum
Committee began consideration oi
the “D” grade The Math
Department was concerned that,
because of its reliance on a purely
numerical grade calculation
system, a number oi students
,received no credit although they
had done “D” level Work, There
was also a feeling that the “D”
would provide greater ilexibility
for students who were one or two
courses short oi graduation and
currently were unable to graduate
because “D” grades were erased.
By including a “o” grade, those
students would be able to receive
credit for those courses and would
be able to progress at the expected
rate. At the same time, there was
some concern that a student should
not suffer too greatly from the
introduction of the “D.” It was
introduced to expand a professor’s
ﬂexibility, to relieve a prof from
having to fail students where it was
avoidable, and to give students
greater opportunity to meet
graduation requirements In order
not to be overly punitive, a
provision to erase all “D” credit
exceeding a 16 credit limit was

adopted. in addition, consistent
with its desire to maximize student
opportunity ior normal progress
towards graduation, the Coma
mittee allowed for up to, though not
more than, 4 credits of “D” work
towards fulfillment of major
requirements.

The Committee on Academic
Standing (CAS) and the Student
Body have equally serious but
differing reservations about the
proposal.

While the CAS supported the
introduction of the “D” grade,
they were opposed to some of the
specifications of the Curriculum
Commiteee proposal. The CAS
objected first to the sixteen
credit limit on “D” credit which
could appear on a student‘s
transcript. It was felt that this
change should be consistent with
current practice of including all
passing grades on the transcript,
even when they did not Count
towards graduation. There was
also concern that removal of
credits from the transcript would
be complex and burdensome ior
the Registrar's Office. This
problem could be easily eliminated
by requiring that it would be the
first 16 credits of “D” which would
he automatically counted on the
transcript and that the student
would not have the option of
deciding which Classes with a “D"
grade would be included and which
would not. The CAS objected to the
striking of the “D" when a course
was retake" for the same reasons
stated above It would seem that
the advantages of flexibility
without burden to the student
would outweigh the desirability of
maintaining tradition.

The CAS also objected to the CC
plan to allow up to 4 credits of “D”
towards the major. The CAS felt
that “D” work was inappropriate
in upper level courses in the major
and reflected a lack of readiness to
progress in the major If received m
an introductory level course while
this seems legitimate, the
limitation to 4 credits of “D”
within the major would seem to
require that the student would
either show substantial success in

 

the other major courses, or would
have to drop the major.
A broader concern about the

 

introduction of the “D” was ex
pressed by members of the student
body. There was some tear that
introduction of the “D” would
result in a potential lowering of
grade point averages for students
who were interested in main-
taining the highest GPA possible
because oi the intense competition
for entrance into graduate schools.

The response to that concern
would seem to be several fold.
First, very few students would be
affected by the introduction of the
“D”. Second the “D” would not
significantly change anyone's
Grade Point Average. In fact,
receiving a single “D" gradein one
semester would change a student’s
average by only .25 for that
semester. Consider several
examples: A student who received
three “B” 's and a “C” would have
a GPA of 2,75, A student who
received three “B" 's and a ”D"
would havea 2 5 GPA. 0n the other
hand, a student who received three
“B" ’s and failed the fourth course
because a “D” option hadn't
been passed would have the best
average dial], a 3,0. but would only
have 12 credits rather than 16.
Finally, a student for whom a
difference of .25 in GPA is that
crUCial might be well advised to
reevaluate their plans or come
mittment to the Chosen Course of
study. While the introduction of the
"D” will benefit a small number of
students, it will not have an ad
verse affect on the majority.

A second component of the
Curriculum Committee Proposal,
dependent upon the adoption of the
first, is thata “8+" and “0+" be
introduced in addition to the
Current minuses and that all
numerical equivalents to letter
grades be discontinued. The ll‘r
creased range was felt to allow for
precisely that, a greater degree oi
differentiation between students
for those professors who desired it.
Numerical equivalents were
eliminated because they do not
serve a significant purpose within
the College and because other
institutions utilize their own
grading scales anyway. This does
not seem to make a whole lot of
difference one way or another.
Those who wish to compute a
numerical average will do so

anyway, It may save the ad-
ministration some effort in com-
puting these averages, however,

Finally, the Curriculum Com-
mittee introduced a plan ior
reintroducing a credit-erase ops
tion, with the following limitations:

1, that no more than one course
of 6 credits or less a semester can
be taken credit erase excluding
ind. study;

2. that no more than 8 credits of
CE work count toward a major;

3. that a student must declare the
course credit—erase by the deadline
for declaring a “plus two,"

4. that C-E in a course be handled
the same way as registering ior a
course;

5. that credit be defined as
“Satisfactory (C) work or better."

The rationale for adoption of the
CreditvErase option was that it
would allow students to take a wide
range oi courses without a
negative reflection on their overall
academic accomplishment or
success within the areas of
specialization, The CAS rejected
this rationale as being unrealistic
and suggested that CrE would
encourage preoccupation with
GPA. They also noted that it might
increase the number of students
who received no credit for courses
taken

We agree with the Curriculum
Committee and believe that the
introduction of the Credit-Erase
option would expand the rangesof
courses a student here could feel
free to take, while decreasing
considerably the amount of
pressure upon students generally

On balance, we believe that the
Curriculum Committee Proposal
should be adopted in its entirety,
While we find the dropping oi
numerical equivalents to be
irrelevant to the general course of
world events, we believe that the
other components of the Proposal
would substantially improve
student and faculty options in the
areas of course standing, course
evaluation, and course selection.
We urge the student body to par-
ticipate in this Sunday’s
discussions and to support the
Curriculum Committee Proposal.

By eliminating the position of
Recreational Specialist, the
college community is losing an
invaluable personage, Kathy
lvlcCluskey. Consequently the
community faces the dissolution of
its outdoor recreation program

Although Ms. McCluskey’s title .

will be assumed by Tom Latimer,
her talents will not. As an “ad-
ministrator" Kathy is presently
teaching five PE, courses, holding
evening workshops, leading air
ternoon and weekend outings, and
providing the organizational back-
bone oi the _Grinneil Outdoor
Recreational Program.

Her hackrourtd includes ex
tensive training from the National
Outdoor Leadership School
(NOLS) and kayaking experience
with U.S. champions, to name but a
lew. l-ler qualifications have been
proven and appreciated through
her success With students.

When Kathy leaves the college
campus, no one will take her place,
Tom Latimer will provide for the

outdoor recreation program, he ‘

will not lead it. He will allow
evening workshops. he will not
instruct them. Byetransferring the
responsibilities oi Recreation
Specialist to Mr, Latlmer’s
position, the college will be
providing ior recreation, not his
spiring or instructing it,

it Kathy leaves and Grinnell
does not change its location next
year, then our recreation program
Will be severely limited, Grinnell is
situated in a recreationalde ert,
Without the know ow,
organizational abilrty,’ and
abundanttime for careful planning
that Kathy provides, there can be
no student outing club

We feel that in Turner’s analogy
of GORP. to the Middlebury
Outing Club, he is making a
mountain out of a cornfield.
