Students protest Nazi march

by Trt-na Cleland

Tentative plans by members of
the American Nazi Party to hold a
Small march in Skokie, Illinois
have resulted lll Various actions
and opinions by participants in
campus religious groups,

There appears to be a strong
possibility lhat the proposed
march, which has been delayed by
lengthy court proceedings. will not
take place. The Co 0 k County
Court oi Appeals recently over»
turned a Circuit Court judge’s ban
on tile march, the only current
obstacle to the action is a Skokle
ordinance which requires the
groupto tile ior a marching permit
a minimlim of 30 days before the
event. However. the enthusiasm of
the Nazis for [he demonstration,
according to observers, appears to
have lost some of its initial fervor
due to the drawn-out Court
deliberations.

PLANS ior the march prompted
the National Conference of
Christians and Jews to advocate
the wearing oi yellow Stars of
David to indicate unity with and
support of Jews while the legality
oi the action was being debated.
College Chaplain Dennis Haas and
Howard Burkle, members of the
Religious Studies Department,
sent out an appeal several weeks
ago ior members oi the campus
community to participate in the
symbolic display, A number of
students subsequently wore the
homemade stars.

However, junior John Schechter,
head of the Associated Jewish
Students at Grinnell. while
respecting the good intentions of
the wearers. called the sporting of
Six-pointed stars “inappropriate
and misguided " His Statement on
the Subiect reads:

”BECAUSE there are many and
complex opinions held by the
Jewish students at Grinnell, I am
speaking only ior myseli. While the
ideas of showing solidarity and
understanding were admirable.
the symbol and the means of
showing these ieelings were
misdirected The ‘yellow star.'
because of Its Nazi origins, is a
symbol that cannot redeem itself.
Not only was the yellow star a
symbol oi shame and degradation,
but the star also served to strip
each Jew of his identity. the
wearers became ‘the people with
the yellow stars on' whose
facelessness made it easy for them
to be given tattooed numbers and
be murdered. Since the yellow
stars were worn unwillingly, it is
inaccurate to depict the stars as a
positive and uniiying symbol in the
Jewish communities.

“Furthermore, to Wear the
stars now Is to hand Hitler El
posthumous victory: a con-
firmation of the idea that there are
undesirable peoples who must be
marked as such Not only does the
wearing oi the yellow stor make
niony Jews uneasy tor the above
