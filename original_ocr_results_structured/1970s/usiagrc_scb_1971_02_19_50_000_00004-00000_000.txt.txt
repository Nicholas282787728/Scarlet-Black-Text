Friend Treated Unfuirly

The Publications Committee voted three weeks ago to accept
“reluctantly" Jim Friend's resignation as business manager
of The Scarlet and Black; they voted 472 February 9 to “re-
commend" that Jim receive $100 of his expected semester
salary of $250, with the rest of the money to be returned to
the SGA. Rationale for the action, as expressed ina letter to
Jim, was as follows: "There is asrrongfeeling in the commitv
tee that your resignation is a serious Setback for the publica-
tions program this year and a bad example as we approach the
time for newappointments. We indicatedat the time we accepted
your resignation our strong feeling that it constituted a breach
of good faith and a breach of contract. Both you and the com-
mittee had stressed last fall when you were appointed the im*
portance for the newspaper that the editor and business man-
ager serve for a full year; it was with that understanding that.
appointments were made.”

I deplore the committee's action; I believe it was totally un‘
just. Jim's resignation was legally, Ig-rant, a breach of con-
tract; and the committee did emphasize that they wanted the
two jobs to be fullryear jobs. However, under the circumstan»
cos, I do nor believe Jim’s resignation was a breach of good
faith, a setback for the publications program, or a “bad
example".

Jim accepted the job with the full intention of working for the
entire year. He found that the jobtookmoro of his time than he
had anticipated and had fewer rewards than he had hoped.
(There was no one on campus to tell him what the job would
be like.) He built what is probably the largest staff ever
assembled by an S&B business manager, and A1 Schoene was
completely trained in all aspects of his job. When he found in
mid- semester that the job was more than he had bargained for,
what was he to do? He could either have cut his effort in half
to ”make it through" the year; or he could have finished the
job in a complete manner and then given it over to someone
whom he lotew had the time and desire to do the job as well as
he had the first semester.

Jim made the second decision, and itis my opinion that it was
the best one for the newspaper and for the “publications progr
ram." The "bad example" argument seems to me to be sper
cious at best, given the nature of the Grinnell student. My fear
is that the committee's action will do more to hurt the job of
business manager than anything else. I hope the matter can be
resolved quickly as possible to ensure a quality publications
program for next year. As part of that resolution, the matters
of salaries and a reasonable expectation for the tenure ofa
business manager should be intensively discussed.

Adelberg Corrects 5&8 Quotes,
SoysNotice‘On Story Too Short

To the Editor: With a smallnumber ofmajors

There are a number of mis- and a reasonably large numr
takes in the article that apt ber of students, obviously
peared in last week's issue most of our courses are for

regarding the effects of the
change in requirements. Since
the quotes attributed to me
seriously distort what I had
said, I would like to take this
opportunity to rectify them.
First, the number of current
majors in the Mathematics
Department is not twelve as
reported, but eighteen. I had
indicated that we expectedabr
out twelve majors from the
sophomore class.

Next, the quote attributed to
me about courses for non-
majors is sheer nonsense.

ACM Culbotks

The ACM is tentativelyplanr
ning to cut back its off-cams
pus academic programs to ten
for next year for fiscal reas-
ons. Five of those programs
will probably continue to be
administered through the
ACM'S central office, While
five others will be adminisr
tered through individual colt
leges.

The five central programs
are expected to include NEWr
berry, Argonne, Urban, Ur-
ban Teaching and Arts in
Florence and London. The
other five will be Costa Rica,
Wilderness Field Station, Gen
ology, India and Japan.

The program cutback
does not include such ACM
services as the Single Applir
cation Method and thePeriod-
ical Bank.

In a related development,
Dean of Administration Waldo
Walker has announced that all
participants in ACMacademic
year programs will pay nor-
mal Grinnell tuition, plus $50,
plus transportation, room, bo~
ard and other program costs.

non-majors. My understand‘
ing of the reporter‘s question
concerned possible "cultural
math courses" apart from
any sequences or applications
to other disciplines, which
differs substantially from

courses for nonrmajors.
Finally, the comment that I
am “a bit leary of the depart-
ment‘s upcomingparticipation
in the tutorial program” is
pure editorializing. The words
are not mine, noristhe intent.
In a matter where accurate
information is extremely im—
portant, it is unfortunate that
the interviews had to be hand-
led as casually as they were,
by telephone at one's home,
with no advance notice, andno
opportunity to review the copy.

Profs: ”5&3 lnsuiis Goldberg”

To the Editors of the 5&8:
The 5&5 account of Pro-
fessor Irwin Goldberg‘s par-
ticipation in the faculty meet-
ing of February 8 should not
go unremarked by his cell-
eagues. His rather extended
statement was reduced to a
few random words taken out of
context, and to add insult to
injury, he was referred to in
the cheap mode of personal
insult disguised as witty lam-
poon. The right to misrepre‘
sent another's thoughts ls gr~
anted to no one. The right to
a gratuitous expression of
contempt is granted to every-
one in a free society, but it
is not a right on which a ci-
vilized man wants to stand.

Editor‘s reply: I must take
some personal responsibility

for the context in which Mr.
Goldberg's words were print-
ed; therefore, this reply.

First of all, some back-
ground: Timothy Porges, who
along with John Pepper has
covered faculty meetings th-
roughout the year, submitted
his article Thursday morning
for Friday publimtion. Upon
reading the article, Inoticed
some passages which I felt
did not belong in an article
that purported to be a news-
feature. Specifimlly, Ideleted
about four paragraphs from
Mr. Porges' account of Mr.
Goldberg's remarks. What re-
mained failed to please any
one. Mr. Forges was upset
because the remainder fail-
ed to fully represent his case,
and faculty members still ob~
jected to the treatment given
Mr. Goldbergﬂmssibly more
so bemuse the quote was sh-
ortened). I did take the ref-
erence to Mr. Goldberg to be
a "witty lampoon" in the sp-
irit of his speech; Iam pere
sonally sorry if it was taken
by others asa "cheap . . .per-
sonal insult."

My policy on the S&B has
been to give complete free-
dom to my reporters; there-
fore, it was only with much
hesitation that I deleted any
portion of the article. At the

‘time I felt I could delete no

more without utterly destroy-
ing Mr. Porges‘ work.
Further, I feel that the qro
tes as Stated in the 5&3 Feb-
ruary 12 do net ”misreprer
sent” Mr. Goldberg's "(hOU’
ght. ” The nature ofjournalism
is such that short quotes must
often be taken; and I feel that
those portrayed, as well as
any, the spirit of Mr. Golds
berg's speech. I felt that the
speech, which Iheard, was one
of the most serious assaults
on the competence of the stu-
dent body of Grinnell I have
ever heard. The term
“gratuitous expression of
contempt” applies as much, if
not more, to Mr. Goldberg‘s
speech as to Mr. Forges'
article. While not endorsing
the tone of the article, Ifeel
that it nevertheless was wr-'
itten in the same spirit as the
speech it covered.

Yule Discovers Yale 0f Midwest

by J. c. Labowitz

How many of you out there in
SEtB land got turned down by
Yale or Harvard from high
school? Or Vassar or Rad-
cliffe? OrToledoSub—Normal,
for that matter? Did you ever
wonder why you aren't up there
in old New Haven making with
the boola-boola-bulldogrbu11-
dog- bowwowwow?

Now some enterprising Yale
types have come out with the
ultimate in college guides -
The Insider's Guide to Colle»
ges, subtitled "Everythingyou
always wanted mask the inter-
viewers but were afraid to
ask". This tomeisguaranteed
to tell you exactly what you
did wrong about getting into
colleg H, and what you did
right, since you did somehow
manage to get intothe Harvard

book is obviously aimed at

Inner-City Seminars Offered

Inner City Seminars, spon»
sored by the Board of Reli-
gion, offer Grinnell students
an opportunity to observe ur~
ban problems and the way soc—
ial welfare agencies meet
them, says Senior Dave Br-
oadwell, who is in charge of
the seminars at Grinnell.

Seminars are scheduled to
take place in Chicago, Minne-
apolis, Des Moines and Dene

first week of spring vacation.
In previous years, seminars
have also been held in New
York and St. Louis. According
to Broadwell, twenty~five stu-
dents have signed up to parti-
cipate. Applications are still
being accepted, he says.

The Board ofReligion serves
as a contact for students at
Grinnell and sends ,them to
churches and settlement hou-
ses in the city. The agencies
are responsible for develop‘
ing a program for the students
once they arrive. According
to Broadwell, the agencies
want to know what students
are interested in, although in
the pastsomeagencies haven't
been very well prepared for
students. The Board of Reli-
gion arranges for the agency
to be paid for the program.

Eldora Training School who
are applying as freshmen
someplace and need guidance,
but it does provide highly en-
tertaining reading for those of
us who have already made it.

The Yale folks got together
in their own littleelitistworld
up there and sort of swapped
stories about all the colleges
and universities that they felt
were worthy of talking about.
or at least that anybody would
want to go to. Then they con-
firmed their opinions by send-
ing out questionnaires to a
"representative sampling" of
current students at these schr
ools, whose comments they
throw into their evaluations of
the schools. The final result
is highly biased and generally
cynical, and tends to smack of
Eastern provincialism (right
onl), but the whole thing is
probably as good a picture of
these schools as you will find
in any book of this type.

The book has an introduction
mat is almost worth the price
of the book alone. It naturally
is worthless to as in any real
sense, since it tells how toget
into schools, but it does pro
vide an excellent insight into
how people are accepted or
rejected. You can figure out
why State U. loved you while
Stanford managed to survive
without your presence. The
insight into Yale'sadmissions
is fun, particularly if they
turned you down.

But the meat of the book is
in the discussion of 200 colle-
ges and universities, broken
into such divisions as Pres-
tige (Ivy) Schools, Small E35,
tern Institutions of Quality
and Style (Amherst, Swarth-
more, most 7 Sisters), Small
Eastern Schools of not much
Quality or Style (Middle-
bury‘ll), and, my favorite,
Hard Playin’, Hard Drinkin',
Hard Lovln' SouthernSchools.

Here the Yalies do their stuff,
deStroying Harvard subtly,
quietly admitting that there
may be other schools that are
comparable to Yale, but they
have to do just that (compare
themselves to Yale),and, wot-r
der of wonders, they write an
amazing summary of acer-
min, Sweet, Secure, Midwese
tern Liberal Arts College, as
they classify Grinnell. Grin-
nell is in the league with An-
tioch (rated as interesting)
and most of the rest of the
ACM, including Olaf (“if you
want to be a Norse god") but
omitting Ripon, Cornell, Coe
and Monmouth, since noEast-
emer would go to any ofthose
places anyway.

But the Grinnell review is
damn near unbelievable. Did
you know that at Yale they
have an image of this place
as "one of the most enlight-
ened, progressive colleges in
the Midwest or in the entire
country for that matter”? Our
"faculty belongs more in the
Ivy League than in the com-
fields of low". This is fol-
lowed by continuing praises
that boggle the average mind
(including a reference to
“closerby Dubuque" - don‘t
