Meats future looks dim

Students will not draw into Mears Cottage this

spring.Alth0ugh the ultimate fate of the dorm
has yet to be decided, some fear that the building

will go the way of the women’s gym and disappear

while students are gone this summer.

The recent trustees‘ decisions
about Mears Cottage raise im-
portant questions about the ape

P" spa ‘P

pearance oi the campus, how best
to expend funds on the physical
plant and what image the college
wishes to project to itself and to the
outside world,

At the heart of these questions is
the issue of historic

preservation and what role It
should play in the college's
decisions about its important older
buildings, An analysis of the
trustees' decision—making process,
to the degree that process can be
ascertained. also introduces
questions about the selective use
and-or disregard ol expert
opinions.

The college notes in its current
catalog that its “90»acre campus
has 35 buildings which reflect the
history and growth at the in
stitution,” Tlial is not entirely true.
The oldest building on campus,
Goodnow Hall, was not constructed
until 1884, decades alter the college
iirst opened its doors.

TWO YEARS BEFORE. a tor-
nado had almost totally destroyed
the original campus. In this cen-
tury, however, and especially
recently, the college itself has been
the principal destroyer of its
buildings in an attitude that has
seemed all too little concerned
about those structures which still
do reilect the history and growth oi
the institution.

It would appear mat the college
can ill afford the loss of Mears
tbuilt in most, which would leave
Goodnow alone to convey its
nineteenth century history, And
how safe. one is tempted to ask, is
Goodnow'!

IRONICALLY, THE trustees
were quietly approving the
demolition of Mears last winter at
approximately the very time find]
work began on nomination papers
to place both Mears and Goodnow
on the National Register at
Historic Places. This register is the
official list of those cultural
resources which the nation con-
siders most worthy of preser-
vation. John Burrows, '77, com-
pleted a study of the two buildings
for a history seminar and ﬁled the
nomination papers in the spring.

Processing or those papers has
proceeded through channels
established by the Historic Sites
Act of 1935. as expanded by
Executive Order 11593 of llﬂl,
According loan official spokesman
from the Iowa Office of the
Division of Historic Preservation,
the papers are in excellent order,
ottlcials have completed all
preliminary screening and ap»
proval and both buildings should
acquire National Register status in
January.

TIIIS LISTING HAS lmportanl
rainiiications. lt recognizes the
historic and cultural significance
of Mears and Goodnow and the
judgment or prolessionals that
these buildings should be
preserved and wellrmainlained,

The listing also renders the

rehabilitation. which would
maintain the exterior integrity
while allowing tor extensive
alteration of the interior [or an
alternative use, The college would
also be eligible tor a grant of
matching lunds to pay tor the
actual restorative or rehabilitative
work.

THE TRUSTEES. according to
President Turner. are unaware of
Mears's lmmlneni listing on the
National Register, There appears
no evidence that the Board
seriously considered moving on its
own to nominate the building or to
encourage others to do so, nor does
it appear the trustees actively
explored other channels tor
preservmg Mears.

Their decision to raze the
building. Turner said, arose
primarily trom their own reading
or the Grinnell College Housing
Study completed in 1976 by Dober
and Associates, My own reading of
that report, however, concludes
that it supports the preserving oi
Mears rather than its destruction

IN EVALUATING the
residential housing of the college
and in recommending imr
provements, the Dober study
foresaw three possible futures for
Mears: its destruction; its
rehabilitation: or lina|ly, lb full
restoration.

mendation was that “rehabi-
