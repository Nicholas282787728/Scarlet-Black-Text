Succahmobile coming

,by Nathaniel Borensrern

Rabbi Moishe Kasowitz, Iowa’s most
eminent Chassidic rabbi, will visit
Grinnell this Tuesday wiﬂ’l his holiday
road show, the “Succahmobile.”
Traditional Jewish music and
mysticism will be his theme.

Kasowitz is a member of me Chahad
(Lubavitch) movement, the only one
of the once-myriad Jewish mystical
sects to not only survive the
Holocaust, but emerge from it with

it you asked a “typical" Grinnell
student just what urey thought the
various women’s groups on campus
"do,” you might get responses rang-
ing from “Oh, I don’t know . , , ” to
“Aren’t they just a hunch of women
who get together and talk a lot?”

The Grinnell College Women‘s
Group, the Grinnell chapter oi me Na-
tional Organization for Women,
(NOW) a women‘s support group led
by Janet Carl, and an alternative sex-
uality support group are the four
organizations on campus whose pur-
pose is to serve the needs and in
terests of women, and, in some cases,
those of men, too.

“We are different from being
another interest group, like GORP, in
that we have a political side too,” says
Melissa Gerhardstein, unoll'icial Coor-
dinator ol the Grinnell College
Women’s Group. Once a very active
group during the height or the
“women‘s lib" era, the group has been
rather dormant in recent years, but
initial interest, especially among
freshmen and transfer students, is
strong this year.

Basically, they are “starting over”
with about 25 new members who, as
Gerhardstein says, “want to do things
and he a together group.” As a group,
they reel they can help the campus,
but their main purpose is to provide
emotional support ior women and to
focus on women.

One of their major projects this year
will be Women’s Week (Nov. 16 - 21),
which celebrates women through
various films, speakers, a singer, and
a women’s massage workshop.

Brown bag lunches, an idea of the
Ames Women’s Group, will be infor—
mal meetings with short films and
discussions, poetry readings, and
possibly some short plays.

The group is also concerned about
the limited health care available to
women in the area and hopes to revise
the women‘s Health Care Resources
booklet this year, post inrormation

, about birth control and sell-breast ex-
6 amination, and possibly provide

sufficient spirit and vitality to address
directly the problems of modern man.
The rabbi says he has come to live in
Iowa to teach that Judaism has more
to offer than the Westernized
synagogues of America dare reveal.
But, what on earth is a
“Succahmobile?” Why. it is a succah
on wheels! A succah, incidentally, is a
ﬂimsy hut with holes in the real and
fruit inside, The rabbi is touring Iowa
to revive the ancient Jewish lestival of

transportation to clinics in Iowa City.

The group isn’t taken seriously, but
they hope to change this through bet-
ter advertising, perhaps on KDIC and
in the sea They do not consider
themselves, nor do they want to be, a
militant group. Rather, they want “to
look forward, not back.”

Janet Carl, associate dean of Stu-
dent Affairs, has directed another
women’s support group [or the past
two years, which she terms as a sort
of “consciousness raising group to
make people more aware." It is a
group of women who get together to
talk and examine their personal feel-
ings and attitudes. This group
“becomes what the participants want
it to be," and they talk about issuES
and prohlems or all sorts.

There is good campus response this
year, although the group doesn’t
operate well with more than 10 or 11
people. Carl is also involved with the
other women’s groups on campus as
an advisor, sewing as a liaison and
source of support.

essential expression of such gratitude.

mystic mystery leaves you unmoved,
there will be Jewish food and music to

on central campus.

Variety is key for women’s groups

Gay Community, the alternative sex-
uality support group is an informal
group of about eight women who meet
to discuss lesbianism and bisexuality.
Their discussions focus mainly, but
not entirely, on alternative sexuality,
and the meetings are open to any in-
terested Women.

The Grinnell Chapter of NOW is a
community-based organization open to
both men and women. Debra Stuart,
director at Career Services and presi-
dent of NOW, feels that it‘s a
“fantastic way" for students to meet
and keep in touch with the outside
world,

NOW is more politically oriented;
among their goals are the ratification
of the Equal Rights Amendment in
Iowa, reproductive rights, an improv-
ed image of women in the media, and
lull participation in political activities.

The group is in transition at the mo-
ment, but last year had 25-35
members.

From emotional support to politics,
there is an ample selection of groups
suited to meet the needs ol' almost any
woman.
