“Reach for the sky," said the thug with
an air of conﬁdent sen-assurance match,

gesticulaliug iingertips as they waggled sky-

“A robbery is now in progress," he con
tinued, "and I mean to take all that I can
get.” Money and yewels poured iorth in
profusion and abundance into the sumptuous
canvas sack which was being circulated at
the thug's insistence, From his central
vantage point, this hateiul maniac eyed
with gleeiul satisiaction the endless torrent
of bills and baubles flowing like molten

indeed, this sociopath’s meticulous care
and painstaking preparations were paying oil
in a most tangible way. The social event
or the year was taking place, and now he,
Antoine de Eeauxbeaux, was successiully
making off with the goods. It was a giddy
moment in his otherwise ungodly and Dre
mature existence. “Why? Oh, why?” moaned
a corpulent matron, as she grudgingly def
nuded her spongy jowls ci a splendid spare
kler on a silver chain. “Because! Be
cause!” retorted the Wily Antoine, once
again getting the better oi a potentially
tricky situation.

Aintoine de Beauxbeaux, the famous {lap-

At night, however, Antoine would make his
rounds ot the city, looking ioi- trouble. And
tonight he had iound it in a big way. The
bulging sack oi loot and booty now came
iorth at its own accord, or so it seemed,
as it was so swollen with illegotten gain.
Maniiesting greed and excitement, AntOine
snatched this illegotten gain irom the
pianist, who was the last to contribute and
who had deitiy managed to sneak a iew
piano keys into the sack {or diversification
and substance. “Zut alors, show me the
door!" Antoine pirouetted madly through the
crowd, which was speechlessly transiixed
with the aroma oi it all. ,

Now Antoine was in the front hall oi the
great mansion, once the home oi a major

league baseball player, and was about to

make his escape once and ior all. “I do
it to keep young,” he said to himseli in
undertones iull or meaning. Then he saw
it: atop a snow white pedestal oi match—
less smooth marble there rested a price—
less art treasure, in great majesty and
splendor It was a sort oi toad, of un-
known dimensions, and it was composed
oi particolored chips or glass, held tor
gether by a sort or leaden webbing. Any
tool could see it was the iamous stained
glass toad oi antiquity, and Antoine de
Beauxbeaux proved no exception. Heclutch»
ed at the toad ecstatically and ran out the
iront door with it in his sack, and then he
made his escape into the cool night air.

sonnet oi Mere Being

Two white pigeons upon the garden grass
Searching ior seeds and long iorgotten crumbs
Knowing each person must have more than some
A man site, watching them as the days pass.

A man sailing upon the golden sea

Watching as swans and ducks ﬂoat by.

Knowing the ancient tear that iinds his eye
He sinks down, watching the bare autumn tree.

Marking the edge at the sun’s purple rays,
Knowing that loneliness ends all our days
a man nys, hearing each long haunting cry.

The palm at the end of the mind is cold.

A man can only know the terrible truth he beho

Just because it isn't done

And never once has tempted,

Turred,

Enticeti the soul of anyone

Before me;

iii rail to attempt it,

Take a try heiore i die,

Get the story,

Then I’Ll never (eel I’ve won

Nut once I have dreamt it.
