trend is taking place Without
advance planning on the part of the
iaculty. “This is an extremely
unwise course tor the faculty in
general. The iaouity should had
some way to deal with the priori-

Burkle deiended his program,
noting that this major Could be Dir

members, and thereiore will not re-
quire taeuity expansion. Faculty
chairman Beryl Clotlelter proteste

that it was “not germane" to the

It was during the mitlst hi this
debate that the doors swung open
and the Russian May 1 demonstrzir

With that, the demonstrators flied

John Kleinschmidt and MDl‘l‘is

proposal. In support oi his posts
tion Parslow cited some verses
[ruin the Aeneid to the effect that
the words of God were once Writs

Cave was opened, the leaves were
scattered. Under the Religious Stun

Alan Jones had the last word on

that the college simply would have
to find a “balance between tru-
