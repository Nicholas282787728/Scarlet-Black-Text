ACM-GICA Discuss Possible Merger

A possible merger belweenthe As-
sociated Colleges oi the Midwest
(ACM) and the Great Lakes Coli-
eges Association (GCLA) is under
consideration in both groups,

The (GLCA) is quite similar to
the (ACM) oi which Grinnell is a
part. it is composed oi l2 small

liberal arts schools located in in-
diana, Michigan and Ohio. When the
president oi the CLCA leit to take
another position, the CCLA appro-
ached the ACM about a possible
consolidation oi the two associa-
lions.

In an interview with President
Glenn Leggett and Dean oi the
College Waldo Walker many of the
diiiering opinions and sides came
to light.

A consolidation of the schools,
Leggett felt, would combine all the
best liberal arts Schools in the
Midwest (including Colorado Col-
lege, a current member oi the
ACM). Such an association would
be in a strong position to gain
government grants and lobby Ior
legislation favorable to education.
The two associations already main—
tain a joint lobbyist in Washington.
but he is responsible to two diff—
erent associations.

The merger would representa con-
solidation into one central oiiice
oi the two associations. The ACM
Currently maintains an ofﬁce in Ch-
icago while the GCLA has head-
quarters in Detroit.

Walker cited some of the disad-
vantages oi such a merger. An as-
sociation of 24 schools would reach
a “critical mass.” There would be
difﬁculties in co—ordinatil'lg efforts
and programs among member sch-
ools, and the sense of identity at-
tainable among associations of IOr
12 member schools which Walker
felt was desirable would he lost.

What form any consolidation would
take has not yet been determined.
It is uncertain Whether the Consol-
idation would result in co-ordlna-
tiou between the two groups, ab-
sorbtion oi one association by the
other, or the formulation of a com»
pletely new organization.

.Members of the Executive Com—
mittee of the ACM are scheduled
to meet in Chicago November 27
to make a recommendation to the
ACM presidents on a merger pro-
posal. Members oi the Executive
committee are: Bernie Adams, Rir
pon College; Lloyd Warner, C0107
rado College; and Leo Nussbaum,
Coe College. Leggett. past preSr
ident ot the ACM Schools, is also
a member of the executive com-
mittee, but has disqualified hims
self Irom discussions on a mer-
ger proposal because he favors
merger of the two associations wh-
ile Walker and many numbers ofthe
iacuity seem opposed to such an
action. He therefore feels he could
not fairly represent the institution.

Happy Turkey Day...

on the block.
