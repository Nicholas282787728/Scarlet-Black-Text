supply and adequate short-term
conservation measures, it faces.
like the rest of the nation, a con
tinuing longterm energy problem.

Though a committee was formed
last fall to deal with the college’s
energy situation, it has only met
once and a longterm energy plan
for the college has yet to be
developed.

On September 28. 1976. the ad-
ministration sent out an 8117
campus memo to students an
nouncing the formation oi an
encrgy policy committee,

Montgomery, College President A.
Richard Turner and others. the
committee was designated to
perform three functions. First, it
was to provide an educational
iorum for the college. It was to
inform the community of “the

Qi‘eallty oi the energy crisis that is
‘still upon this country, and con
trary to popular view, will be with
the United States for some time
The committee was also emr

' . powered to complete an energy
audit of the campus and recomr
mend ways in which to eliminate
energy waste.

it has not, however, performed
any oithese iunctions since its first
and only meeting in October.

At that meeting, according to
committee chairman i-iawn, it was
determined that in order for the
committee to perform its duties
adequately it must have a data
base upon which to make

”recommendations. Getting this
data, according to l-lawn, involves
establishing a metering capability
in each building on campus in
order to measure energy con
sumption, With the current central
heating system, there is only a
central meter.

Hawn explained that he un«
derestimated the logistical
problems of collecting data here
and that this has accounted for the
delay,

“We now have to refine our

programs and go after individual
buildings. But we can't do that
until we get a data base and know
where we’re at,” he said.

I-lawn indicated that he has yet to
ask the administration for funding
for these meters. The committee
will meet when meters are in-
stalled and data is collected, he
stated,

The long delay between com-
mittee meetings prompted one
committee member, junior Keith
Harmon, to write a letter to
committee members admonishing
them ior failing to meet more
regularly.

“As a member of this committee
I am very concerned with the
apparent lack oi progress we have
made this last semester. [know of
absolutely no progress we have
made beyond the first meeting,”
he said.

Although he recognizes that
progress in energy conservation
has been made through use or
“quick fix" methods which require
mechanical adjustments and little

 

capital investment, Harmon said
that the committee must begin to
work on the problem in the near
future.

“I think that efforts to cut down
on energy have been made irom
the physical plant, and i think the
numbers show that progress has

; been made on cutting down energy
- consumption. But the committee
: is concerned

with making
recommendations and iorming a
long term energy policy. In my
opinion, that Can’t be (lone without
getting a data base on our energy
conservation. That requires get
ting some expensive meters to
monitor our energy consumption
and i think that is where the delay
has been. i think progress will be
made now. but I don’t believe we
can attempt to form an energy
policy Without those statistics,” he
said. ‘

llown, according to Harmon, has
achieved mixed results in his cf-
iorts to combat energy waste.

“He's made an effort in the short
term things, and there have been
positive results. But in the long
term things he has been lacking,"
he said,

Harmon is not the only member
of the committee who wants the
committee to become more active.
President Turner has been in touch
with Hawn, and has urged the
committee to get in touch on a
regular basis

Turner believes that one of the
committee's major iuctions, its
role as a community educator
concerning energy problems, has
been neglected while it waits for
statistics.

“1 think part of the problem is .. .
what are they telling the come
munity?” he said.

In his letter to the committee
members, Harmon commented on
one of the ironic aspects of the
committee's lethargy.

“It seems a bit paradoxical that
an energy oriented committee
would have difficulty overcoming
inertia," he said.

' Women’s groups

was devoted to organizing a
leadership structure. The first
severe disagreement was between
those who saw the need for a
leadership hierarchy and those
who viewed a hierarchy as
reminiscent oi a male power
structure. This split left only five
or six women in the group by
December 1975, “Women aren‘t
taughtto lead,” Horwltt continued,
“No one was Willing to accept a
leadership role, There were very
few dedicated Individuals but most
wanted the benefits—like the
consciousness-raising groups—
while low wanted to participate
actively. It was a case of the blind
leading the blind ”

Related to the leadership
problem was a lack of locus or
clear direction "We could never
decide on an area of concentration
for the groumwhether to be active
and political in the community or
devote our energies to the con»
sciousness groups " A direct
consequence of this floundering,
says Hormtt, was that the group
concentrated on issues of lesser
importance, such as the problem oi
how It) deal with mcn in terms of
the group. ”Men were allowed at
meetings but were not encouraged.
No men were allowed in the
steering committee meetings. We
felt it was important to make
decisions without the presence of
men.” Horwitt believes that the
group was sidetracked to these
tangential problems because they
involved concrete issues. “It was
easier to deal with these kinds of
problems rather than the more
important questions of ‘what kind
of group do we want?’ " she said.

The physical location of the
women’s centeria three room
triple in Smith Annexiposed
further problems. “Nobody knew
about it and it's not very central,”
said Horwitt. The fact that the
sexuality center, the Lesbian
Union, and the women's group are
all housed in the same building
seems intimidating to some people
Jane Casto added that She “never
liked the place" and wonders if a
better space could not have been
found.

Personality conflicts, inevitable
in any organization, were also a
stumbling bloclt, ”Trust and
support were repeating themes in
the meetings,” asserts Horwitt,
”but there was incredible hostility
and tension within the group.
There was a split between gays and
straights, and between radical
separatists and moderates By the
end of the year we were simply

Vegetarians rejoice! Michael
Wiener has taken over Quad kitr

Mike is a student truly interested

plimentary proteins, and other
wholesomc foods for the body as
well as the soul. Food Service
Director Dave McConnell is

hopeful prior knowledge of Mike's

Jane Casto and Jeannie Simpson
attempted to renew me women’s
group this year, Taking a lesson
from past year’s failings, says
Casto, “we aimed for fairly
autonomous activities that didn't
need an organization at the top,”
Some of the projects planned were
women's weekends, learning
coups, task forces, and con
sciousnessrraising groups. For the
present the group appears to be
dormant, according to Casto.

Casto in particular felt that some
kind of direction was needed at the
very beginning. But, she says, the
approximately fifteen women who
attended the first meeting “didn’t
really react to any of our ideas.
They showed up but didn't show
much enthusiasm." introspection
and supporticharacteristlc oi
consciousnessrraising groups~
quickly came to be the focus of this
year‘s group. “There was no in-
terest in outwardrdirected ac-
tivities,” reports Casto. describing
the group as ”very apolitical ”

This lack of a strong political
ideology, coupled with the lack oi
structure or leadership, is viewed
by Casto as the primary causes oi
the apparent demise of this year’s
group, “No one last semester sawl
feminism us’a political thing. If
there had been a real burning
desire to light ior certain goals, it
women had felt discriminated
against in specific contexts. then
women would have grouped
themselves for better
organization."

The small size of the group
about fifteen women initiallyi
l-lorwitt blames on the negative
stereotypes oi women‘s groups.
“We were Viewed as oflshoots of
radical feminism. There was a lot
of rhetoric I think a large part the
community viewed us as radical,
