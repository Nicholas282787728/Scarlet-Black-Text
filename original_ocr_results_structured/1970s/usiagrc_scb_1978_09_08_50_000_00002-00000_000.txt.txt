Gadfly future is doubtful

hyl’aulhlol

The future of the (radfly. last
year‘s campus alternative
newspaper, is uncertain. according
to Tom Kiefer and Rhonda West,
two of the publication's chief
contributors,

So far. the former staff has made
no plans to continue the paper. Few
of the (iattliy‘s collective editors
remain on campus, West ex-
plained A lack of interest and
enthusiasm have also contributed
to the fladfly's present condition

TIIF, (iiuu-‘u' (till-1w ()UT of
the nowedefunct leftist student
group called the Organization or
Student Action The paper became
the “mouthpiece tor the group.”
according to West,

The pape; also functioned as an
alternative newspaper tor any
students wishing to express
opinions It was primarily a tool tor
the analysis oi topics lrom a
radical perspective, In its three
issue lite span. the (iudtly printed
diversified opinions on a number of
topics. as well as news clips and

tiziittt succeeded in its goal of
intlucncing student opinion and
provoking thought She added that
the administration’s view of the
newspaper was basically
pessimistic. although some
members of [he administration felt
it was a positive ettoi-t in that it
presented a forum for different
viewpoints, Kieier admitted that
although Widely read, the (iniltly‘s
validity was questioned by both
administration and students,

in spite of some problciii.. West
termed the (itiilfl) "an idealislic

success." If nothing else, she
believes. it raised the campus‘s
political consciousness.

WEST EXPRESSED HOPE that
the Gadfly could resume
publication, although prospects do
not look good right now. Alters

radical opinion are also being
investigated But to make the

an interest by members of the
Grinnell community must be ex-
pressed.

Youtz calls tor plans to “keep

close tabs” on the Student role in

the evaluation of faculty and the

role oi the EPC s.
in addition, at the suggestion of

the 5&3. SGA will formulate a
bathroom policy this semester and
plans an informal meeting
sometime in the future to discuss
the issue.

Last year's proposed SGA
constitution is still an issue Last
spring, President Turner refused
to signa revised version which was
apprbve‘d'b'y both‘Joint Board and
by‘ the student body in an all
campus reierendum, According to
Youtz, Turner did not Sign the
revision because it included a
phrase giving Jomt Board the
power to remove Joint Board-
appointed committee members.
That amendment followed a debate
amongSGA and CSL members last
spring concerning the con.
Stitulionality of the removal of CSL
members by Joint Board,

SGA Vice President Tom Kiefer
will attempt to rewrite the cone
stitution this year mainly to
correct technical points such as
punctuation and grammar, which
he says cause unnecessary amr
biguity. He also hopes for some
”serious discussion" about the
Constitution’s “validity,"

Next week, Joint Board will
discuss the 1978779 budget.
