Impeachment Imperitive

by Fred Horecky ,

On Monday, February 25, Pre
dent Nixon tinally held his first
tormal press conference since last
October, The 'press coiilerence has
not been used frequently by Mr. NixA
on as part of his “Operation Can-
dor.” It was theretore with great
surprise and expectation thatl timed
in' the radio to hear the President
subject himseit to the questioning
of reporters.

I had previously believed that the
purpose of a press conierence was
to enable reporters to question the
president on unclear aspects or ad
ministration policy. Mr. Nixonchose
to begin with a ten-minute oration
on the improving energy situation.

, According to the Nixonian strategy,
the press conterence must be used
to create the image of a strong,
vital presidency and to downplay
“distasteful" issues such as Wa-
tel-gate. ,As usual, Nixon succeeded
in obscuring the issues more than
claritying them.

Ironically, the tirst question alter
the presidential oration on the env
rgy situation dealt with Watergate.
Would the PreSident waive execu-
tive privilege to supply informar
tion to the Judiciary Committee?
Mr. Nixon replied that he‘would do
whatever was consistant with the
Constitution and the ofiice'oi the
presidency. This evasive reply co-

uld be construed as a polite rein-
sai.

The dilapidated and humiiiiated
state oi the presidency becomes
clear when the President must de-
ny that he is a crook. It must have
been rather embarassing tor the

President to have to declare that he
would not be impeached and that
he could only be impeached tor a
criminal otiense, in any event, the
president did nothing to repair the
sad state oi the presidency.

Perhaps Nixon’s mustquestionabie
assertion was that the Constitution
clearly proscribesimoeachmenton-
iy tor criminaiotlenses The term,
“high crimes and misdemeanors”
may be “pertectly clear" to Mr
Nixon, but constitutional scholars
are now engaging in an intense
debate over its meaning. It is my
opinion that Nixon could be im'
beached tor political reasons, (or
tailling to execute his oath oi Mir
ice, and ior tailing to assume res»
ponsibility tor the conduct at his
subordinates.

We must now realize that impeas
chment by the House loiiowed by
a trial in the Senate is the only
reliable method otdetermmmg Ni-
xon’s guilt or innocence.

ISPIRG Local Board Coordinator

“Unlortunateiy, with a lobbying

in the 1950’s a man emerged trom
comparative obscurity to become
a iorce in the jazz world about the
same time as Miles Davis did, and
under similar circumstances. This
man was Sonny Rollins, and hehada
pervasive mnuence on the lite oi
jazz in the times,

ln~59 he retired trom public view
ior two years, andhasdonethesame
several tlme since. His newest ale
bum, Horn Culture, (Milestone Mr
9051) is one at his best albums
in recent years. It has the trad-
itional Rollins trademarks; cadene

tric bass. David Lee on drums, and
Mtume on percussion.) Mtume also
contributed the second track “Sale
is," an essay in modes on which
he also played piano The track
itseu is‘very interesting, and con-
tributes to much of the success
oi the album Using very little st-
ructure, it builds and builds and
then dies out. It is fully the long-
est track on the album, and one of
the most enjoyable.

The best track on the album is

There are two excellent blues,
both penned by Rollins himself, on
the album, ”Notes tor Eddie” and
”Love Man.” They create the well
rounded Rollins blues atmosphere
very well, and abound with good so-
105 from both Rollins and his sidev
man. But the mostsatisiylngRollins
on the album isthe balladeer Roll»
iris. The perioi‘mer of “God Bless’
The Child" and “Good Morning,
Heartache" is the bestonthealbum.
Rollins is, after all, one o! the' few
men around who play old bauads
as part ot their standard repitoire.
His periormance and melodic gifts
are among the best in jazz today.
In the latter number, Rollins‘ ends
with a well executed cadenza, ot the
type that ﬁrst brought him fame in
the iiities.

Rollins is ‘a man who cares very
little (or the adulation oi ians,and
the raves of critics, and has said
he is no better than average. Eat-
her than the usual trite comments
about artistic and false modesty,
let me just put it this way. This
album proves conclusively thatRoi—
lins is more than just an average
Joe, far more. He is the greatest
living tenor saxophonist, and the
only man in theiieldtcdaywhcseace
complishments are not extensions
oi the only other tenor saxophonist
in modern jazz who could evercomr
pete with him; John Coltrane, He is
still an amazing talent, and prize
duces work that can equal anything
put out by anyone today.
