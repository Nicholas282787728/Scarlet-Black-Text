DEAN 0F ADMINISTRATION WALDO S WALKER

Walker To Be Dean

Dean of Administration Waldo S ,Walker will become Dean of the Col—
lege upon the departure oi Joseph 1“ Wall irom that position in January.
President Leggett announced his appointment of Walker to that position
at the meeting of the Board of Trustees in June, and the Trustees “flank

mously ratified the decision.

James L .Hamilton 0f the Department of Economics has been appointed
to the newly-created position of Associate Dean of Administration, effeCr
tive at the beginning of this semester. Hamilton’s appointment is for the
duration of the year, although the exact definition of his second—semester
duties is not final. He retains his title of Assistant Professor of Eco—

nomics although he will not teach.

Dean Wall resigned as Dean of the
College while on leave at Brown
University during April oithis year.
He stated at that time that he thought
he could ”find more personal sate
isiaction and can make a greater
contribution by teaching and writing
than i can in an administrative po‘s—
lion.” He will return at the be
ginning of second semester to the
faculty as Parker Professor of
History.

Walker came to the college in l958
as an instructor in the Department
oi Biology and became a full Pro-
fessor in that department in 1968.
He and Dean Wall began periorming
their duties as academic and bud-
getary directors oi the college in
January 011969 while James Strauss
held the position of Dean of the
College and Provost. Upon Strauss‘s
resignation Wall and Walker as-
sumed their current titles and
duties, The Dean of the College
oversees academic matters and the
Dean of Administration is in charge
oi budgetary and administrative
matters.

Upon Wall’s resignation President
Leggett in a letter to the college
community on May 9 asked ioi- sug-
gestions and recommendations from
members of the faculty and the 5'“,
dent body concerning the selection of
a new Dean, Walker, he told the S-B
was the ”overwhelming Choice” of
all who talked to him, and the 3p,
pointment was thus made shortly be»
fore the June Trustees meeting,
The exact title which Walker will
hold and the definition of his duties
has yet to be determined A commit-
tee oi the Trustees is currently
examining the problem. The posi-
tion, however, will deiinitely underv
go some redeiinition, In the May 9
letter Leggett observed that the new
Dean would have ”responsibility
for the oversight of the academic
program and the current operations
budget of the College " Those two
duties have for the past few years
been handled separately by the Dean
of the College and the Dean of Ad
ministration.

Mr. Hamilton will assist both Deans
Wall and Walker during the coming

semester in planning the long-range
academic innctions oi the college,
besides overseeing the direction of
the computer operation, which Dean

Walker has done in recent years.

Hamilton will conduct "a running
analysis to determine where we are
in certain areas or the development
oi the college,” Walker told the 3.3
Thursday. This involves not only
participating in analysis of off-cams
pus programs begun by Walker last
semester, but also assisting Walker
and Controller Robert Anderson in
planning the budget. He will also be
involved in gathering data ior long
range academic evaluation studies.

have continued on the too while
the terms oi the new pact are state
tled. College Business Manager
Ralph Pomerenk told the S-B toe
day that he expected the negotia-
tions to be completed in "the near
future”, probably within the next
week.

Although the negotiations have been
lengthy, Pomerenk said that there
had been no real problems up to
this time, and that he did not forsee
any, Any contract is subject to the
wage guidelines set forth the Wage
Board under President Nixon’s Eco-

the Board, the pact cannot include
additional wage and iringe benefits

an official selection can by made.

returning to Grinnell this fall to
complete his undergraduate educa-
tion, but will not be resuming the
position of Student Coordinator. He

ter being selected from afield of
seven applicants.

The Student government Associar
tion, according to Vice»Fresident

the problem of filling the positions.
Recommendations irom the campus
community are welcome. Both posi-

as an ASSistant to the Sudent Coore
dinator, has also decided not to re-
turn to Gl‘innell. SGA is searching
