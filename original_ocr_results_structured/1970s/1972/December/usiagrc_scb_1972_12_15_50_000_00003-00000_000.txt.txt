Recent studies have shown that
glass recycling is prohibitively
costly in terms of energy consump-
tion. The only teasible answer to
the glass waste problem seems to be
the reuse of glass containers. It is
therefore encouraging that in Ore-
gon, an October 1 ban on nonreturn-
able bottles and pull-top cans has
been quite successful so far. Twice
as many bottles are coming back
to store owners than before the ban.
No depression of sales or loss ofre-
venue has been noted. Ii Oregon can
effect such an efficient transition to
returnables, it is difficult to under
stand why students at Grinnell are
reluctant to return the bottles from
the campus pop machines to their
proper places.

This year marks the lSOthanniverr
sary 0f the birth of Frederick Law
Olmsted, a man who did not like
to be called a landscape architect.
He was one of the first men to use.I
a holistic approach in planning the
urban environment.

Unlike many ofhis contemporaries,
Olmsted did not {oresake the city
to moral and aesthetic degradation,
hut sought to make it as pleasant
a place to inhabit as possible. The
parks he designed in cities across
the country have often been bas-
tardlzed, encroacned upon, or have
become havens for sniiiling junkr
ies, as in the case or New York‘s

Central Park. Nevertheless, these
green spaces are as important, it
not more so, to the liveapibty of
the city than when the concrete nights
mares surrounding them were de—
signed with some concern tor the
human perspective. Olmsted, who
studied the traditional English Gar—
den, created a mode of articulat—
ing a landscape so that it seemed
not designed, but modulated into a
suggestive wilderness.

Men like Olmsted, John Muir, and
Henry David Thoreau are a rare
breed in contemporary society. Our
attitude toward the environment is
one or acute schizophrenia, on one
hand, we exploit natural resources
without limit to fee the insatiable
gaping maw oi the Gross National
Product. [On the other hand, we 657

flee their urban environments in
their motorized campers to spend
their leisure time crammed into
campgrounds next to other escapees,

Youth Air Fares Abolished

by John Wylie

Rumors that the Civil Aeronautics
Board would abolish youth fares
were confirmed Decemberlwhen the
Board voted 3 to Z to cancel youth
fares which provide a confirmed
reservation at ”the earliest possir
his time,” according to the
New York Times News Service.
Youth standsby fares are also in
jeapordy according to the report,
although the exact timing for their
cancellation had not yet been an-
nounced. The Board plans to inves-
tigate ways that the elimination of the
special discount fares canbe usedto

lower air fares generally, and the
abolishment of the discounts will be
held in abeyance until a plan is
worked out.

Also aiiected by the ruling were
discount fares for families and ex-
cursion groups. The Board's an-
nouncement said that these discount
fares would be cancelled "within 18
months”.

According to a spokesman for the
Grinnell Travel Center, the CAB
ruling would “certainly not affect
the Christmas travel plans for Grin-
nell students who are flyinghome”.

symptomatic oi a common malaise
which afflicts Western man, and es-
pecially Americans the separation
of man and nature.

That this split, plus a host oiother
factors such as ourJudeosChrlstian
concept of the earth as created for
man, should result in the rape oiour
land, water, andeinel-al resources
is not surprising. But the reason
why it also results in the latter
consequence is not readily obvious.
The reason is that man strives to
reunite himseli symbolically with
nature, Camping, hiking, sailing,
mountain-climblng, sorting, and
snow-mooning are all symbollcgess
tures in an unconscious effort for
this reunion.

At the same time, these activities
(particularly mountalnrclimbing)
allow man to, in a sense, overcome
nature just as his torebearers had
to, The popularity of the ‘western'
genre of entertainment indicates the
iascinated longing we have ior the
irohtier period when the hardships
of the wilderness were quite real.

The Apollo space program hasbeen
rightly called our newest frontier
and with the Sixth and final plant-
ing at the American ilag in thelunar
dust, that frontier too, has come to
a close, In a perceptive editorial,
the Des Moines Register compared
this ultimate act at arrogance with
Sir Edmund Hillary's planting uihis
flag in the summit of Mt. Everest.
Tenzing Norkay, Hillary’s Nepalese
guide, smiled indulgently at thetlme.
What was a supreme conquest oina-
ture to the Westerner was a reli-
gious pilgrimage to the Buddhist
guide who then offered a prayer to
his god.

The Iconoclast

 

leisure Of The Theory Class

by Gregg Definer

No student, or group oi students,
has the right to use iorce to intim-
idate the administration into aquies-
ing to their demands, A demand
(ii denied) must be backed by force;
and ii the initiation oi iorce is imr
moral, so are demands.

The idea that the occupation of a
building by students, or a sltrl'n is
a legitimate means ot protest or
threat, is a consequence of accept-
ing mass civil disobedience as a
proper tool oi political action.
Hence, an examination of civil disA
obedience is in order.

Acceptance of civil disobedience, in
this century. is a consequence of
its connection with the “civil rights
movement” In that issue, the Neg—
roes were the victims or legalized
injustice and thereiore, the matter
of breaking a law was taken, by the
country, as a light ior Justice, not
as an assault on the law.

ii and when an individual (or a group
of individuals) disobeya law in order
to bring an issue to count, as a test

Justitied (in some cases) Here the
protest is directed only a at parties
ular law which the person wants
to prove unjust; and such action in-
volves respect Ior legality.
However, in a civilized society,
the kind ot mass civil disobedience
that involves the Violation oi the
rights oi others is unjustifiable,
even where the demonstrators' goal
is good, The ends do not Justify

the means. This sort of mass dis-
obedience is an attack on the very
concept oi rights. It is a mob’s
deiiance oi legality as such,

As an individual, no studenthas the
right to sit-in, in the room of an-
other student, and no student would
stand ior it, Likewise, no student
has the right to do a sit-in, in the
office at an administrator he dis-
agrees with, nor in any of the col-
lege’s buildings, etc. The iorcible
occupation of another's property is
a blatant violation of rights, andone
does not acquire such a right by“
Joining a gang, nghis are notamat-'
ter of numbers. in law and moral-
ity there is no such thing as ac~
tions forbidden to individuals but
permitted to a mob,

There is, however, a difference
between an individual and a mob--
the latter has greater muscular
strengths-plain brute physical forr
ce. The purpose of civilized Society
is the prevention or solving social
