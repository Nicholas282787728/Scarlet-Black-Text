Phone Operators: Campus Nerve Center

by Michelle Casey

“Good afternoon, Grinnell Col—
lege", With these or similarwords,
the live college telephone operatiors
handle Calls from people they learn
to know by name and voice but sel-
dom seer

Virginia alackwell, 1st Weaver,
Jean Gipson, Rosezella Wood, and
Edith Clark work eight hour shifts
at the telephone switchboard located
in a tiny room above the heating
plant.

Chief Operator Virginia Blackwell
has been On the switchboard tor the
past six years, and she talked about
her work in It recent interview with
the 5&3.

It is difficult to estimate the num-
ber of calls an operator receives
in a given length or time, she said,
because the volume or calls coming
through the switchboard varies
widely There are periods oi ale
most continuous calls, when an oper-
ator moves from one line to the next
without a break Sunday night is the
busiest time of all (as students tryr
ing to get an outside line will tes-
tily) Other times, the hoardis quiet
for a while, and the operators 0C7
Cupy their time with puzzles and
knitting.

Compact and efficient would be the
best word to describe the College
switchboard today. Gone are the ca-
bles and plugs, with rows and rows
oi sockets, which has always char-
acterized the word “switchboard"
to most people, In its place is a
low, sleek console with rows or
lighted buttons, 3 standard touch
tone dial in the center, and an in—
conspicuous headset [or the operator
on duty.

Problems do plague the board at
times, though, and these canbetrus»

do little but call the repair Service.

and wait for someone to track down
the diiliculty. This happened during
the interview, when Ms. Blackwell
Iound herself unable to reach ex-
tensions beginning with the number
live. A repairman soon arrived,

however, and the problem was quick-
ly located.

The best thing for phone users to
do in these situations , she explained,
is just to be patient and realize
that the operators are trying their
best and working as fast as possi-
ble to aid callers,

Tips on the Phone

“What would be most helpful to
everyone would be it people would
use the Herd book”, says Ms, Black-
well. It people would look up tele»
phone numbers, and memorizethose
they use frequently, the operators

at .c .i

would not have to tie up the board
looking tor; numbers and could do,
vote their time to taking incoming
calls.

People who receive collect calls
should also learn their special bil-
ling numbers, she said, to help speed
up service And tor people who need
to transfer calls from one extension
to another, there is a simple rules—
just dial 0, This way, the operator
can automatically know which trunk
line the call is on,

Ms. Blackwell noted that, overall,
the switchboard Could be used to a
fuller extent if people remember
these simple guidelines and don’t
needlessly tie up lines.

In general. she finds her job in-
teresting. It is most exciting. she
added, when overseas calls come
through the board, and she has dif-
ticulty understanding the operator,

The question of the nature and ex-
tent of Student Rights has never been
resolved. Every so otten when the
question rears its ugly head the
students get a lot oi loose-tipped,
mealyrmouthed talk and a few cone
cessions irom the administration.
The student’s challenge of the star
tuSrquo is especially difficult when
the status-quo is much. Student’s
rights are poorly defined at best,
and this can only lead to conflict.

Rather than leap into that emo-
tioh—ridden held or student protest-
stndent rights on college education
policy, a view ol another simpler
area is in order - students' rights
within hails: Students’ rights with
in residence halls, are so ineptly
stated that interpretations of its
manilest contradictions are iutile.
These rights are enumerated on
pages twenty-nine and thirty ol the
Student Handbook. They are divided
into two sections:

I The Use of Residence Hall Rooms

A. Each resident has the right to the
use oi his room at any time tor studying
or sleeping

S. Each resident has the right to quiet
hours as recommended in the Student
Handbook and voted by the individual
hall.

c. it it does not interter-e with one’s
rocmmates' or hailmates' rights to study
or sleep, or with one’s hnllmates' right
to use their rooms tor recreational
or social purposes, each residenthaslhe
right to the use or his room tor recrea-
tional or social purposes

D. Each resident has the right toexpect
cooperation lrom his roommate, and the
duty |0 cooperate with his roommate,
in regard to recreational and social uses
more room

E Each resident, in cooperation with
his roommate, has the right to coeducar
tional visitation in his room duringthose
hours determined by the hallgovernment
in accordance with the procedures stipu-
lated in the student Handbook.”

First, are studying and sleeping
the only unconditioned room rights
one has? it would seem according
to section A that if one wanted to
sleep during the day- then nobody
could make noise in the ball. This
however is not the case in pracr
tice, and in fact, quiety hours are
entorced generally in the evening
hours alone. Does this mean that
section it wasn't intended at all?
Hence, either the rule were intende
ed as stated and the college simply
entorces another unexpressed set
or rules, in which case the best
that can be said ol this hallowed
institution is hypocracy; or thel‘ules
were never intended and what is
practiced by the halls represents
the real rules, in which case the
alleged student rights are a traud
and a lie.

As [or rule E nothing need be said.

II, The Right to privacy

It, Deals with the rights at college
oiticails Io enter a room, One has to
be given at least twenty-tour hours no—
tice of such an entry, excepl in cases
or em rgencv.

B, - 'nch resident has the right to the
use or the bathroom at any time without
being intruded on by a member oi the
opposite sex."

C, "Each resident has the right toader
quote lorewarning ot cooliucationalpasr
sage through hallways "

Rule E must be terribly difficult
to enforce, especially With the emr
ergence ol coed bathrooms, and with
regard to rule c. Undoubtedly even
President Leggett is guilty ofinfrac-
tion of the‘fairer sexes right to
privacy.

To say that the expression or stltr
dent rights ranges from the impos
sible to the absurd would be kind,
but it really is not a joke, Whereas
most students may not careaboutthe
noise etc. on campus most of the
time, the question at what todoabout
those times when it gets to be a hose
sel must be answered.

Ideally the‘voice problem Could be
answered by sound proofing the
rooms, but technology does notsolve

the moral problems we currently ,

face. These contradictory and anter
diluvian rules serve only to make the
administration look ridiculous

If the enumeration of student rights
residential halls is moronic what
Sort Of rationality and Justice can
be expected‘in regard to questions
of student power?
