Quest For
A New Reality

by Virginius Bi Thornton III

Assistant Professor of
American Studies

we are seeing today the surfacing of the
"internalized revolution, ” the revolution
which Lerone Bennett has defined as taking
place in the “Winding corridors of the
mind,” without which the revolution in the
streets could not succeed. This “inter»
nalized revolution” (that revolution which
takes place in the minds of men) which
Bennett speaks of can be defined as the
psychic liberation [rpm the all encompass-
ing “cultural imperialism" which is so
endemic in Eurpeon and EuroAAmerican
culture,

In this generation of black college stur
dents we are seeing come to reality the
profound statement left us by Frantz Fanon,

"l So, Comrades, let us notpay tribute
to Europe by creating states, institutions,
and societies which draw their inspiration
from her. Humanity is waiting for some»
thing other from us than such an imita-
tion, which would be almost an obscene
caricature. if we want Africa into a new
Europe and America into a new Europe,
then let us leave the destiny of our
countries to Europeans. They will know
how to do it better than the most gifted
among us. But if we want humanity to
advance a step further, iiwe want to bring
it up to a different level than that which
Europe has shown it, then we must in-
vent and we must make discoveries.”

The ”raison de’etre" of Black Studies
has as one of its basic tenets the task of
defining, defending and illustrating the
"whole truth" of a people, past, present
and future. Black people have been pic-
tured as the bastard children of Western
Civilization, devoid of culture. Ralph Ellison
was once asked by a group of young black
writers how they might more truly reﬂect
the complexity of the human condition using
the black experience as a theme, He re-
sponded that the black writer would never
see his subject if he accepted the stereotype
of the family as a broken one and a matri-
archy, or of Harlem as “piss in the halls and
blot) on the stairs." Such cliches, he went
on, may have a basis in reality, but they
vastly oversimplify the complexity of the
plank condition, denying “that something
else" which makes for our strength, which
makes for our endurance and our promise.
Benjamin Quarles recently observed.
“when we pick up a social science book,
we took in the index under ‘Negro,’ it will
read, ‘see slavery,‘ ‘see Juvenile Delin-
quency.’ perhaps ‘see Commission on Civil
Disorders;’ perhaps see anything except the
‘Negro.’ So when we try to get a perspec-
tive on the Negro, we get a distorted per-
spectve.”

it is, thus, necessary for us, as black
people and academicians, to develop a
totally new frame of reference which ex-
ceeds the narrow enclave olwhite concepts.
We can ill afford to continue to allow our
reality to he prostituted by the likes oia
William Styron or a Daniel Patrick Moy-
nihan. For too long our reality has been
conceptualized by the lalse universality of
white concepts. Carter G. Woodson, the
father of black history, raised the quasi
tion iii his celebrated book The Mis-Educa-
lion of the Negro (i933), and one might
add that it needs to be raised once agai
“By what right do we, the victims of Wes-
tern Civilization, grant a priviledged posir
tion to the values and concepts ofa
civilization which defines us as antic
values?" w. E. B. Dquis gives us yet
another rationale for the creation today of
Black Studies Programs:

“We have long believed withuut argument
or reﬂection that the cultural status of
the people of Europe and of North America
represented not only the best civilization
which the world had ever known, but also
a goal of human effort destined to go on
from triumph to triumph until the per-
fect accomplishment was reached. Our
present nervous breakdown, nameless
fear, and often despair, comes lrom the
sudden facing of this faith with calamity ”

Black Studies then is a new way of seeing
our reality. It is a new approach at crea-
tivity. it is a new rationality, It is a new
way or seeing. It is a new way of thinking.
Too much of our thinking and scholarship
is Europe-centered, We must conceptualize
knowledge in terms within the perspectve
of our own needs and interest for the libera—
tion and development of black people.

Philosophically, there is a need for a new
kind of education for black people, conceived
broadly as an instrument for social and pere

sonnl change. There is a great need for i
new philosophy of education which will have
as a mandate the charge Offinding solutions
for poverty, war, ignorance, injustice, and
oppression,
I am Optimistic lrnm my own vantage point
at the attempt to develop not only inllovar
tive courses, but a totally new methodology
which transcends the narrow limits Of Iron
ditional scholarship. For if we do not now
dare to do this, the words of Frantz Fanon
Will apparently follow us as we now approach
the 21st century:
”Shall we continue fulfilling the slave
destiny assigned to us by the system we
live under; or shall we consciously, tier
liberately betray this destiny lor our
own souls, our own future?”

A Christian

Grinnell
Experience

by Kathy Nelson

Of all the various groups and ideas to
which I have been exposed while at Grinnell,
Grinnell College Christian Fellowship and
the Christian thinking which develops in its
members has influenced me most, both
directly and indirectly.

Regarding my religious lile, this past yenrl
have become more involved in (3ch than
ever belore by being a member of a fel
group (for prayer and Bible study), which has
caused me to really grow as a Christian.
(3ch has also been more involved with the
town churches, the most recent example of
this being the Church service which was
conducted by members of GCCF at the First
Baptist Church on May 14. The involvement
with the town is a good Christian Witness
and good public relations between the Chris
tians on campus and the Christians in town.

Besides GCCF, I have been a member of
two other organizations which have con
tributed to my religious activitiesﬁthe Board
of Religion and the Grinnell College Choir.
0n the Board, I learned about the variety
of religious groups on campus, and in the
choir, we have sung many religious songs
from different time periods,

Grinnell has affected me in several ways
academically. Up until December, 1959, I
was a music major. While taking my first
biology course, 1 felt God wanted me to
become a biology major, in order to study
the life that he has created and to witness
[or him by being a scientist as well as o

The Scarlet and Black

Chrlstlan. I was greatly influenced and ens
couraged to become a biology major by my
enthusiastic lab instructor in Biology l. i
wrote a term paper in that class on cancer; I
am greatly interested in research for its
prevention and cure. This is largely due
to the deaths of relatives and friends afflict-
ed by the disease During second semester
of my sophomore year, 1 decided to special-
ize in botany. The summer of 1970, Ihad
the opportunity to work in the herbarium,
Also during my sophomore year, I became
interested in the relationship between
science, biology, and evolution and religion,
especially Christianity. 1 was introduced the
lollowing summer in a Philosophy at Edur
cation class at Drake University to the
philosophy and writings of Pierre Teil-
hard de Chardln, many of whose writings
deal with Christianity and evolution, (I
would particularly recommend The Vision
of the Past.) lwrole a paper for that class
dealing with the subject and did a “#2”
for organic evolution the following spring
on Teilhard, evolution, and Christianity.
As a result of my interest in botany,l
will start graduate study this fall for a mass
ter’s degree in botany at the University of
Iowa When finished, 1 may teach and/or
do research Next year. I also Wish to res
tain my interest in music by participating
in a university or church choir, and by tak-
ing church music and choral conducting
courses as well as botany courses. At a
later time, I may go to a seminary for fur—
ther training in church music education,

with the idea of directing Children's choirs.

The “Grinnell Experience" has been very
good for me in many ways.

Discrimination

by Al Hammond

As a high school senior ichose Grinnell
because oi its reputation for academic ex-
cellence, which to me translated into its
ability to teach and refine the techniques
of learning and problem solving, Since my
arrival I have found that while there are
many professors and administrators who
believe in, and act to achieve, the aca-
demic excellence the college is purported
to have, There are others who do not.

During my lour years here l have seena
discrepancy develop between what the insti-
tution should be doing and what, in lact,
it is doing. Grinnell is aschool which prides
itself on having a Social consciousness. It
has attempted, during the years i have
attended, to merge academic excellence with
social consciousness. In the process it has
often perverted academic excellence
by equating it With social consciousness.
When a student is graded differently because
of his sex, his ethnic background, or his
religion, he is discriminated against. it
matters not whether the discrimination is
“positive" or ”negative” Anything other
than the students academic proficiency
should be inadmissable in grading, At the
same time, 8 Professor Should be willing
to take the time to fathom the abilities of
each of his students, but this iathoming
is not to be done along ethnic, religious or
sexual lines. Such action on the part of the
professor is biased and bigoted,

The ”positiveY discrimination which be-
stows special privileges and fosters
academic laxity is as bad as its negative
counterpart In the first case. the student
is led to expect a different set of standards
which the outside world does not respect
A graduate who has experienced this form
of discrimination often cracks in the com-
petition Of the real world-whether it is
graduate or prolessional school or the job
market. The special privileges and aca-
demic laxity only serve to deny the in-
dividual the tools he needs to survive.
“Negative” discrimination, too, deprives
the individual of these tools by denying
his right to zlttzlin them. The line between
the two, however, is very line, since both
ultimately deny the individual access to the
tools for Competition and survival.

Such a process has been going on at
Grinnell for as long as I have been here.
Most of the discrimination has been ”posi-
tive”. As a result of this practice we have
created much resentment among those who
receive no special recognition and ulti-
mate frustration among those who do. I
wonder seriously about the type of alumni
this school is now turning out. How many
of us will still feel a positive allegiance
to Grinnell? To the extent that the school
depends upon its alumni for support, it is
to that extent that a further argument
for the creation of a Consistent and fair
set of academic standards can be made
It is clear that the administration in-
tends to move in the direction of consis-
tent slandards, but it is from within the
faculty that the move must come. At the
same' me they must be ready to censor
colleagues who refuse to apply consistent
criteria, While such standards are not the
broad social panoceas we would one day \vhi
broad social panaceas we would one day
wish to invoke. They are the beginnings,
