George McGovern leads Edmund Muskie for both
the Democratic nomination and the Presidency among
Grinnell students and faculty responding to this week’s
SttB survey. in a random sampling oi the student body,
McGovern received 30.3% support for the Democratic
nomination and 22.7% support tor the Presidency
Following him was Muskie, with ilgures 0126.1% and
10.5% respectively. The two men were clearly ahead;
Mayor John Lindsay followed Muskie for the nomina-
tion with a 7.6% iigure while black New York congress—
woman Shirley Chisoim followed the Maine Senator
tor the presidency (incidentally, tieing President
Nixon) with a ligure 014.8%.

Grinnell students will probably have some impact
on the tinai results as only 4.5% intend not to vote
in the election. However, it is unlikely thattheir votes
will be noticeable in lowa, 750% plan to vote in their
home states or use ahsentee ballots.

Economic policies and the war in Vietnam were the
two major issues raised by Grinnell students. 59.1%
mentioned the economy and 40.5% the war. Other major
issues ranged tram ecology (14.2%) to poverty and
weltare reiorm (5.5%) to reallocation oi military
spending (42%) 63.4% or the freshmen listed the
war as the major issue while only 35.6% of the Juniors
mentioned it. Juniors were more interested in the
economy - 62.7% of them considered it the major
issue.

Party labels seemed to he at little importance to
the students . 47.3% listed themselves as independents
and only 59.9% claimed any party alliliation. 157%
or the students and 47.6% of the iaculty indicated their
intention to work tor a Presidential candidate, and
26.6% more students indicated that they had not yet
made up their minds.

Several interesting trends emerge irorn a study or
the iigures. First is the relatively large and consis-
tent support for Shirley Chisolm, whose candidacy
was only recently announced.

Another interesting point is the wide range oi issues
which students saw as important. Twenty eight major
issues were mentioned in the surveys returned. Al-
most all were domestic issues, the only three excep-

. tions being general ioreign policy, the POW issue,
and the war.
