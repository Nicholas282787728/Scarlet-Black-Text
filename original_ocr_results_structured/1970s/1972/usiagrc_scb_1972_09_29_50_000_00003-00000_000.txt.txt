Nikki Giovanni

by Irma McClaurin

For the umpteenth time I have re»
read Nikki Giovanni's poetry, Some-
how the voice inside my head finds
it difficult to mimic the uniquetonal
quality that is as much a part other
poems as the content itself. So here
I sit trying to recapture:

One feels inadequate when writing
about such poets as Ms. Giovanni,
Her poetry demands that one listen
to and "over understand" the irony
in Housecleanlng:

Her images are poignantly graphic,
as shown in Poem for Aretha:

Waller Bradford

by Ken Winokur

Walter Bradford, a Chicago poet,
spoke at Grinnell last Friday. His
lecture was part of the Black Cul—
tural Weekend In this lecture he
spoke, and read several ofhispoems
about the black youth movement.
“The movement, in terms ofyuung
people has had a pretty devastating
effect on black men, especially young
black men. when you consider the
historical background of this coun-
try, in that aggressiveness ls not
only built into the history, it is built
into the national psyche. You are
supposed to go out and beat your
chest, build your house, and tear
down trees. Young black men don't
get an opportunity to go nut and do
that. Not only does that effect them,
it effects their counterpart--black
women,”

Bradford, once a social worker in
Chicago, spoke extensively about the
black ghettn experience. He saidthat

he felt that the city gangs had made
a contribution to the society, that’
they had taught the city youths to
organize, ”
Mr. Bradford said that he was im-
pressed by the Grinnell campus,
especially the Black CulturalCenter
especially the Black Cultural
Center,
to improve it. He encouraged black
students to emphasize their culture,
and ”blacken Grinnell".

Mr. Bradford explained that some
of the previous actions ufBlack youth
as well as the college trained stu-

dent. This was new, and their ener-
gies were sought very actively by
several revolutionary groups But
the black City youth, despite its
corruption, didn’t wholly join up
with the struggle. I think that the
city youth’s goals and expressions
could help show the way of the fu-
ture. “The 50‘: may well be a pro-
yection of the 70’s and well beyond.
We saw participation from city youth
of these goals were very different.
and in some cases in direct con~
flict with the clv' rights and liber~

hum The Smoke-filled Ronni

leadership and And The SGA

by Michael Breed

1n the last couple of weeks serious
questions have been raised aboutthe
role of the SGA cabinet and SGA in
general in campus leadership. Last
week’s editorial in the 5&8 points
out some of the difficulties-~Dag—
enais' and Seeley's criticisms of
Russ center largely around the fact
that he has not been a visible cams
pus leader. Many students expect
a more visible type of leadership.

While nobody who knows anything
about how much time and energy
being in the SGA cahinettakeswould
accuse Russ, Anne, or John of be-
ing lazy or not carrying out their
responsibilities, the fact remains
that none of the three has chosen
to take a very public profile. John,
'in the Pub hassle, got some ex-
posure but this was mainly in the
halls affected hythe GardnerLounge
location and was not very favorable
(to say the least) exposure.

instead, the cabinet members have
chosen to maintain low profiles,
attend committee meetings and try
to carry out the Wishes of the StUr
dents through the school bureaus
cracy. While insomewayseffective,
this type of action does not put any

Recent stuffings of partisan

Ralph Pomerenk,

Pomerenk told the SKIS that
the regulation against political
and commercial stuttings does
not originate with the college,
but rather with the Internal
Revenue Service, whose rules

of them in the spotlight. Russ’at-
titude. expressed inansGAmeeting,
is that he is not an ego-tripper
or a power—tripper and does not
want to be cast in the role of a
dominant campus leaderhthis is
why he has chosen hot to chair SGA
meetings.

Anne also does not view her role
as including being a visible campus
leader, and admits that that kind of
role has always been difficult for
her to assume. She would rather try
to ascertain through contact with in-
dividual students what the needs are
and represent these needs in the
committees

It seems that the three elected
cabinet members would all rather
work quietly. While they have all
accomplished much in this way, I
think that now is a time when the
campus needs more visible leader»
ship from some quarter, and that
perhaps the cabinet is a natural
source for this leadership.

The campus, which for several
years was united by pressing social
and political issues, has become
increasingly fragmented in the last
two years. At the same time there
has been a degeneration of social
attitudes within the dorms and on
campus in general, people simply
are not showing the considerate and
discrete attitudes Of the past in their
life styles. It is time that someone
tried to give the campus and student
body some direction and coherence.

To turn quickly to lighter matters,

the Joint Board met this week.
While the meeting adjourned at 10:00,
so that it didn’t reach the marathon
length of last week’s debacle, it by
far surpassed the previous efforts
at ludicrousity, Out of the eight
items on the agenda (including new
business) only the firstone was com-
pleted. The McGregor report, the
second item on the agenda, was in~
terrupted in the middle for a tour
of the radio station, after which the
meeting was adiourhed.

The first two hours of the meeting
were given over to the finance com»
mittee for passage ofvariousguide-
lines, rules, and recommendations.
It took the Joint Boards half an hour
Just to word the Used Book Store
guidelines 50 that the store wouldn’t
make a profit. They then dealt with
such heavy issues as whether or
not halls should post records of
their monetary transactions, who
should keep books for the S513,
and when accounts Should bezeroed.

An action to raise the activity fee
by $250 per semester was tabled,
mostly because the House Presi-
dents don’t trust the Finance Com-
mittee to have properly researched
the raise, although nearly everybody
agrees it’s necessary. The Onlyim—
Dortant action taken was to rec~
commend that admission he chars
ged to non—Grinnellians at major
concerts This requires action by
a number of committees and p057
Sibly the Board of Trustees before
it can be put into effect.

data to be obtained andasevere need
for discussion to draw out clearly
what our priorities and needs are
so that the rest of the year can be
spent in implementing any changes
that are indicated.

Therefore, sometime during the
next week a rather lengthy (but
easy to fill out) questionaire will be
distributed through the SA's and hall
officers and the mail for students
off-campus, The questionnaire con-
tains three major headings--the len-
gth of time required for the B.A.
degree, independent Study, and
Work-study Projects.~and the
questions cited under these topics
have the potential to raise some
serious thought. The information ob-
tained from these forms wiilbe used
by the All-College arc in summer
tion with other information to sug-
gest and design priorities for the
school to consider.

The “other indormation” is to be
obtained in part from a series of
very informal gatherings through
the month of October, of students,
faculty and the two together to dis
