The Scarlet and Black '

‘ Piano Duo'Remurkuble’

by Richard Westerdale

A part or a critic’s job is inter
pretlng the audience’s reaction to
a periormance and then observing
how this reaction relates to his own.
This kind of analysis if very dif
Cult for the David Montgomery
Nathan Schwarz dumpiano recital
which took place in the South Lounge
on March 31. The amiable audience
which filled the Forum’s South
Lounge obviously came to be
pleased, expected to be pleased, and
certainly lelt very pleased. Such out-
right enthusiasm tor any perfor»
mance as was exhibited last Friday
night is liable to inﬂuence the opinion
or any critic.

The first piece labeled‘fontrar
punctus XVII from the The Art of
Fugue by J. 3, Each is actually the
same as Contrapunctus XVI outwith
a fourth completely obligate pal-t
added to make the piece playable on
two Instruments. The fugue is in two
sections the second oi which Is a
mirror image of the first. Alter an
initial bad start and Verbal encourr
'agement from Miss deLecluse, the
piece was well played in an accepta-

' ble_pianistic style. Entrances oi
the subject were'made dynamically
conspicuous and transition passages
played soiter. Though very popular
tor piano-duo concerts, the piece
tends to suffer outside of the en-
vironment of its companion contrar
puncti.

The second piece, En Blane etNoir,
by Claude Debussy, Is a tworpiano
sonata written toward the end of his
career. The first two movements
may be considered to contain no-
bussy’s impressions oi the First
World War. The third movement, a
Scherzo, is typical oi the virtuosic
pieces oiten iound at the end oi
Debussy’s three»movement collec-
tions.

The playing or Messrs Schwarz
and Montgomery indicated the same
sensitivity required {or a piece
which would he considered relevant
to our own time. Working against the
handicap of two pianos out oi tune
with each other, Messrs Schwarz’s
and Montgomery's execution at the

Smmgemo

Debussy demonstrated a better blend
and, hence, more oi a ieeling that
Just one person was playing. OWlng
to the short length oi time the duo
has been playing together, such
nineties as precision in exposed
passages were not always present
The L M Gottschalk transcription
oi Gioaccllino Rossini’s William Tell
Overture tor one piano and tour
hands was probably considered by
many to he the high point oitlie pro-
gram. It certainly elicited the great»
est amount or audience response
since, throughout most of the piece,
the playing was accompanied by
smokers tram the audience now (Ind
then crescendoing to a gulluw.

The playing itseli would certainly
have seemed very acceptable even at
the time the piece was written, Dil»
tlculties present in the more virtuor
sic passages were oi a mere technir
cal nature Successlul as the per
iol‘mance was, the section 0! the
piece containing the "storm" would
have sounded much better ona piano
with proportionately longer strings,
Mr, Montgomery’s playing in the
upper register during this section
tended to sound tinny through no
innit at his own

From the point or view oia concert
whose main obiecllve was to thrill,
anything lollowing a piano transcrip
tion oi the William Tell Overture
would have seemed antlcllmactic.
strangely enough the Sonata by Franz
Schubert contained some oi the duo's
most beautilul playing. Among the
relatively large selection or literar
ture by Schubert ior one piano and
tour hands, the Sonata, opus 140,
nicknamed “Grand Duo", stands out
as one the more well known

For the most part, the playing oi
Mr. Montgomery and Mr. Schwarz
was quite remarkable with regard
to both the short amount of time
they have practiced together and the
technical and musical dilliculty ol
the pieces chosen The audience's
approval ilsell ought to serve as an

Fairy Tale From Underworld

by Robert Simmons

’The iilm scene is pretty slow this
weekend. Alice in Wonderland is
only a iair movie. but it has some
priceless character bits that are
extremely entertaining. The Russian
mm by Pudovkin is predictably a bit
heavyalthough critically and his-
torically very important.

A collection oi “award winning"
shorts is scheduled for tile Film
Odyssey program tonight. Finally,
the Strand has a film called “Man
and the Wilderness” which is Rich-
’ard Harris versus everything, part
2. Being mauled by a bear, buried
alive, and 1acing John Huston are the
toppers to being hung irom the cell,
ing by his pectorals.

With the Academy Awards in the
air the next topic for discussion Is
the return of Hollywood to Hollywood
or Marlon Branco versus every
thing. Part 467, I am speaking about
The Godfather, the movie that has
everything. See a iaded tormerr
great make his long-awaited come
back. See a tun-loving, Godrfearlng
bunch oi happy-go-lucky gangsters
shoot their way to fame and fortune,
See the movie that all America has
been waiting ior In one oi the in-
dustry's cleveresl and longest pub—
licity campaigns the Paramount Pic-
tures Corporation, Inc, has kindled
more public interest in 3 him than
anything since their last hit , Love
Story. They hope that enough people
will wait in line to pay to see this
movie to put it on the allrtlme top
grossing list.

Most people ‘get their money’s
worth, Whispers oi “He's the one
that’s supposed to he Frank Sinatra”
are mixed with the laughs, applause,
and tears at the appropriate shooting
or strangling, In the realm of enterr
lainment it is quite successllll. The
Godfather is one oi the most “thea-
trlcal” movies to be released In
quite a time, Every moment is Calr
culaled not for its importance to
Character or plot, but for its effect
on the Viewer. This kind of shal—
lowness in a rim usually spells or-
tistic failure, even though the eXr
pected reaction may he achieved
in the mass audience e g. Love
Story and The Summer of ’42. For
a combination of reasons, however,
The Godfather is a critical success
as well.

It may Just be that overstatement
and theatricality are the perlect
touches for the nether-world of
organized crime where corpses are
“just business”. The muted pastel
tones and expensive period recrear
tions give the distance necessary
(or the audience to identify with the
characters. It would be much harder
to sympathize with the death of a
real gangster whose crime was at-
iecting one's own lile. The iairy tnle
treatment, as calculated an ciiort as
anything a big studio ever made
makes these criminals seem to he
a family with a duty and a business
not too diiiercnt lrom any other,
and therelore one to he watched
with empathy and enjoyment

Receanlays 'Enlerlainl'ng’

by Sylvia Wallace

Two contrasting outlooks on man's
earthly predicament werc exempllr
tied this past weekend in the presenr
tatlon oi two plays, The Secret oi
Heaven by Par Lagerkvisl and The
Doctor in Spite oi l-limseli' by Mo-
licre, by the Grinnell College ’l‘llear
tre.

The lirst view, as depicted in
Lagel'kvlsts’ play taking place III at
Lllliplltian replica oi the world, is
that there are no healthy people
(physically or mentally) leit in the
world. Thereiox‘e noone can help
the other Selilslmess and vanity
are prevailing qualities or tile de-
lormed entities lound in this play,

The one exception is the youlhiul
and earnest main character who,
very realistically portrayed, is de-
lealed by the antagonistic, non-
communicative environment upon
which he encroaches,

To the Editors:

Ii you think you are running a news»

you are dead wrong, lor the damaging

I reler to the picture oi myscli
which was, last issue, printed over
the Hume ol'one “Ben 7.. Dreen”
without my permission. This slander
and libel is vicious, maliciously ilir
tended, and personally embar-
rassing to inyseli. Until this prer
posterous lie is corrected (in an,
other of the son's never-ending
series of "rell'action” articles) [
will consider your paper a scandal

only lor the purpose at providing in

Our apologies to Mr. Dreen. -- The
Editors.

To the Editors:
In response to the gay letters to
the 5&3, we contacted Mr, Haas
lor more iniormalion about a pose

, sihle meeting oiGrinllell gay people

Within the week, there will he a
meeting oi gay men and a iuccliug
of guy women. Anyone nt all in-
terested in attending those meetings
should immediately scc Mr, Ilnns,
who will refer you lo the women and
men associated with tllcll‘ respec~
live meetings, We conlulcil our
thoughts to Mr. Hnas bccnusc wc
know that, as chaplain, he is open»
minded und has a gcnulnc concern
lor the student body, All mlormulion

This particular environment was
expertly depicted with the simplicity
of set found in the Theatre of the
Absurd, The Stage was almost harr
ren except {or strange caricatures,
twin screens, and a cross in the
background, Pictures exemplifying
the mood of the moment wel‘e ﬂashed
upon the screens at intervals, and
a stroposcohic light was used to
emphasize moments of turbulence
and contusion, The scenery on the
whole projected a feeling oi isola-
tion appropriate lor the mood oi
the play,

The pace changes at the beginning
oi the second play ., becoming
brighter, gayer, Again this coincides
with the author’s view oi lite and the
games people play The Doctor in
Spite oi Himsell pokes fun at the
avaricious nature of humans. The
tone is light and comical find so are
the Characters.

The coslunles were much more
elaborate in this play than in the
previous ones in keeping with the
Medieval l-‘rcnch setting oi the play
The piano accompaniment by Greg
Gaines also added to the clarity of
the mood changes within the plzly
I might add that Michael Grant's
comic per-lormance in the role ol
Sganarcllo, the lascivious doctor,
was one oi the most outstanding oi
the evening

Congratulations are due to director
Bruce Halverson and to his assis-
tant William Vanderpool. The Set
design was adequate and in keeping
with the moods oi the plays. Prof
James E Reeder III deserves the
credit lor supervising set design
and Michael Grant designed the
lighting The hellindrtherscenes
staff as Well as the cast did It line
job and the presentation was very
entertaining.

Here is one more letter ermil gay
Grinnellian,

This one’s trom a proud and happy
lesbianrrone who has discovered a
wealth oi strength in accepting her—
selt on her own terms.

l'd like to say more about that, but
I don’t know quite how to go about
it That's because I don’t know
enough about that segment oi my
audience which would be most air
tected by it--otlier gay women at
Grinnell--to l-enlly relate to them
in n letter at this sort,

I hope that this most uniortunate
situation will change, l’m surel'ni
not the only person who would hener
lit lroui such it change,

One thing I could say is that maybe
in some ways the outlook oi guy
women is peculiar to their nature
as gay women, as distinct iroln gay
men

(Perhaps I should have started out
by coniirming that we do in [act
exist. A couple of the letters subr
metted earlier to the editor more»
orrless sublly made the assumption
that “homosexual” implies
"mule” )

One more thlngA-ii anyone wants
to add their Views to what has so
tor been said about homosexuals
at Grinnell, and wants to do it in
the lornl of an unsigned letter, they
should present It to Mr. lions, and
he will then vouch [or it to the Site,
0thcl-wisc, thls liewspnper is not
likely to print it Without n sigllar
