”Man is a part of this coo-system

lull. Director or the Iowa Geograr
phicil Survey. capsulized the
general theme underlying the ISPIRG
pnolic hciring on environmental
problems held at Central College
in Pella on Thursday, September
28

"People are going to have to as-
sign a value to things which have
been intangible 111 the past wild-
lile, aesthetics, and resources
themselves," Said Jim Scheffler of
the Iowa Conservation Commis ion
But any speciiic environmental stur
dies are going to load a researcher
into "whole tiers of complex re-
action," cautioned Tuthill. Nonethe-
less. the state geologist felt that
lSPlRG might provide valuable 357
sistance by undertaking studies
which would increase “public infers
mation" on environmental prob
lems.

Center spotlight at the hearingwas
given to issues iocusing on land and
water preservation measureshow-
ever, numerous tangents were rol-
lowed by witnesses, and discussion
also included Wildlife problems,the
use of chemical sprays or addir
lives, population migration, and cor
pctate tarming and the tamily iar-
mer.

Relating to Specific water re—
source issiles, Tuthill found that
"much greater concern tor the
maintenance at theouality oiground
water resources has to beidentified

effected by lSPlRG Discussion on
land-use planning was given inipes
tus by the tact that a tederal pro
gram is now pending and the lows
legislature has set up a Land Use
Policy Study Committee, Ms. Lloyde
Jones expressed the belief that
lSPlRG “could perform a service to
the state oi Iowa" by sponsoring a
survey to determine the present
breakdown in the use of Iowa's
lands, and by compiling data on
details involved in both federal leg‘
islatlon and that of other states in
the landruse area

“Now you can drive along the high
Way and see timber areas bulldozed
away and planted ior agriculture,"
said Schetfler, illustrating the need
for effective landsusepolicies. “For
a state like lowr’i, with less timber
(publically owned) than any state in
the union, this is a tragic loss.”
Echoing the suggestion that ISPIRG
formulate a model land-use bill,
Schelfler deemed lSPIRG's retention
oi a legal director, John Wellman,
as a significant asset. “For any
kind of land-use policy to be ef-
fective it must have real teeth to
it; it must be enforceable. Legal
aspects of a land-use policy are
extremely, irightiully unknown at
this time. . .”

The Fella hearing touched upon a
number of issues which had pre-

viously been raised at the agricul-
tural hearing at Ames. “We want

to assure small farmers an opporr
tunity on the land,” said Roger bloe
baum, Midwest Coordinator for the
National Coalition for Land Reform
He criticized the “monocultural”
approach oi corporate iarmers who
plant corn every year instead or
on a tour year rotational cycle.

He said that although this leads
to a buildsup of disease and ins
sects, ", .no corporate farmer
is going to go out and plant oats
as a nurse crop for clover. They
plant corn every year, and they
just keep putting on the chemicals.”

The use of Chemicals and ‘addi—
tives in farming and livestock was
termed to be an issue of both health
and envtronmental concern, accord-
ing to Mrs Gladys Black, an or-
nithologist. Blobaum enVlsioned the
growth of “a drug culture in the
animal industry."

Proposals from witnesses directed
ISPIRG’S attention toward research-
ing bureaucracies involved in 9117
vironmental control, as well as m,
ward studying specific areas where
pollution occurs. Karch suggested
that lSPIRG “. .investigate me,
among other things. investigate the
effectiveness Ofthe institutional me~
chanisms ior solving our environ-
mental problems."

“We can have any kind at agrir
cultural program wewant,"any kind
of environment we want, . . ,it's
up to you to provide some oi the
leadership to wake people up.”

Baha’i Faith At Grinnell

by Yvdr Stoakley

"And an old priest said, Speak to
us o1 Religion.

“And he said

“Have I spoken this day oi aught
else? is not religion all deeds and
all reilection,

“And that which is neither deed
nor reilection, but a wonder and a
surprise ever springing in the soul,
even while the hands new the stone
or tend the loom?

“Who can separate his iaith irom
his actions, or his beliei irom his
occupations?" And soGribranwrote
oi religion in his classic, The
Prophet.

Yet another Middle Easterner, proe
claiming himself to he a prophet,
wrote halt a century earlier than
Glbran: "Knowledge is like unto

' wings ior the heing, and is as a

ladder ior ascending To acquire
knowledge is incumbent upon all,but
or those sciences which may proiit
the people oi the earth, and not such
sciences as begin in mere words
and end in mere words. . We have
made this—”your occupaticnm
identical with the worship at God,
the True One,"

These were the words oi Baha’u'
llah, Prophet-Founder oi the Baha’i
Faith. The newest oi the worlds’s
mayor religions, the Baha’i Faith
was 1ounded in 1844, 123 years ago.

But the pace at which this Faith
is tlourisning and establishing it-

selt today, is perhaps the lastest in
the history oi religion in little more
than a century it has spread to every
country,,tei-ritoi-y and major island
oi the globe, he adherents file to
be found in more than 50,000 10,
calities worlds wide-"including
Grilinell.

The Grinnell Baha’i community,
though numerically small, has been
increasingly more active since its
first two members enrolled at the
College in fall of 1968

When the first public mention ofthe
Baha’i Faith was made at Grinnell,
is perhaps a fact lost in history
Also, there is no record of who the
first Baha’i to attend or work at
the College might have been. But
it is evident from the records at
Burling Library that Grinnell had
some iorm of Contact with the Baha’i
Faith as long ago as 1931

In more recent times Baha’i
speakers Visited the College on a
number of occasions during the past
decade. But until the fall 0f1968
there is no record of a Baha’i
attendance at the school.

The “mainstay” oi Baha’i activity
is an iniormal gathering called a
“fireside”, At a fireside Baha’is
and interested inquirers discuss a
wide range oi topics related to the
Baha’i Faith. These may include
anything irom “life-alter-death" to
“world peace.” The ﬁresides are
usually held weekly and listed in
the Campus Memo.

Periodically several Baha'i movies
have been shown on campus. These
have included documentaries by CBS
News (And His Name Shall Be One)
and Kiva Films of Sesame Street
(its Just the Beginning),

In 1969 a major symposium on the
Faith was held at Grinnell. Baha’is
irom throughout lowa and parts oi
lllinois participated.

The Baha‘i Club, a campus organ-
ization designed to acquaint inters

ested persons with the teachings and
history of the Faith and to further

the social ideals to which it aspires,
was initiated in the spring at 1971.
its membership includes Baha’is and
non-Baha’ls alike.

Among the annual activities of the
Grinnell Baha’is is the observance
oi several special events days.
These include World Peace Day
(Sept. 17), United Nations Day (Oc-
tober 24), and Human Rights Day
(Dec 10),

In spite of their relatively small
numbers, Baha’is are apt to he in—
volved in a wide variety o1 cam-
pus activities both as a group and
as individuals, So much so that for—
mer SGA President Andy Loewionce
ouipped that “the Bana’i's are the
most politically active group on
campus!”

Action-mthis is the key word in
the liie oi a Baha’i. “Let deeds, not
words, be your adorning,” Baha’u’
llah enjoined his iollowers. ‘Nuif
said.

lEAP Promotes Environmental Quality

by Keith Kozloii

Lirinnell may he tar removed irom
the ravages oi the logging industry
but each student at Grinnell can do
something personally to lessen the
destruction of iorests--paper re-
cycling, According to Bill Persons,
newly appointed director of Grin—
nell’s paper recycling operation,
“seventeen trees were saved ior
each or the twenty tons or paper res
cycled at Grinnell last year "

The operation was originated and
sponsored by Local Effluent Abater
merit Procedures (LEAP) and has
now been institutionalized under the
auspices of Student Government As—
sociation.

Bill describes how the process will
work and what each student should
do. On every iloor at every hall
is a box {or clean paper and a
designated place to stack news-
papers, magazines, and corrugated
cardboard. what exactly constitutes
clean paper?

“Clean paper,” says Persons, “15
best defined by listing what it does
not include such as napkins, tissue
paper, cellophane, wax paper, paper
with a Waxy, metallic, or plastic
coating, tin toil, paper With dirt.
food, or grease on it, carbon paper,
and paper with glue, staples, paper-
clips, or tape on it.” All other
paper, even it crumpled or with
wr' 'ng on it, is classified as clean
paper.

incidentally, computer cards and
computer print-out should also
be put in the clean paper box. Perr
sons has a suggestion to make for
everyone, “If each student keeps
a separate receptacle in his room
[or clean paper and dumps it when
it becomes full, this will minimize
the effort on the student’s part as
well as keep the clean paper box
tree of impurities ”

There has been some problem in
past years when students throw mis~
cellaneous garbage such as beer
cans and cigarette butts in the clean
paper oox Maintenance oi the boxes
is each respective hall’s responsir
hility, The paper will then bepicked
up irom the halls every Sunday night
and taken to Darby Gymnasium
where it will be sorted and stored
until it is 1inally shipped to Des
Moines ior recycling.

The operations success is de—
pendent on the cooperation oithe coir
lege community and volunteers are
needed to help in the project 1n,
terested persons should contactElll
persons at extension 352 or post
otiice box 7131.

Paper recycling is just one oi the
proyects begun by LEAF, Now in
its third year, the interdisciplinary
course has come a long way since
its iirst semester when participants
had an opportunity to sift through
and weigh all oi the garbage prOr
duced by the College, in addition
to a detailed identitication and mear
surement oi all other eiiluents. in
subsequent semesters LEAP 1o~

mulated action proposals ior the
abatement at these efﬂuents and be-
gan work on them.

A partial list of LEAP’S broad
scope of activities include the es»
tablishment of a chartered bus and
a ride board, a one and one half
year study of heat energy use re-
sulting in a proposal to decrease
heat energy use resulting in a pro—
posal to decrease heat energy,
the organization at Earth Day cele-
brations, an analysis at and general
publicity on the phosphate content
oi major laundry detergents, pub—
lication of the Eco-Action Handbook,
3 Continued investigation of the
ieasibility of can an bottle recycling,
the instigation of the use of health
foods at Saga, and the retahleting
of paper for sale.

LEAP also administered a comr
munity survey with the generous aid
of the Grinnell Lion's Club, the
results of which have led to a so-
lid waste proposal for the town of
Grinnell to he presented to the City
council. Finally, LEAP's presence
has promoted a general awareness
at environmental problems, an a-
wareness which has manifested
itself in the decrease in dormi-
tory solid waste output and in the
increase in the use oi recycled paper
and of returnable containers on cam-
pus.

This semester LEAP is analyzing
erosion and theassociated water po-
llutJon in the Rock Creek Lake
watershed. At the end of the sem»
ester, plans will be developed for
effective soil erosion control mea-
sures in the LEAP study area.

Volunteers are needed ior paper
sorting every Sunday evening, 3:15
p.m., in Darby Gymnasium. Re-
treshments will be served.
