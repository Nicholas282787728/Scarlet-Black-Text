Department Counters EPC
Recommend Nasser Removal Again

by Steve Nunn

The controversy over the status of
Philosophy instructor Alan ansei
took a new turli Wednesday when the
Philosophy department notiiied the
Executive Council that is was “re-
allil‘ming and reinforcing” its “urie
ginal recommendation" oi a l~year
terminal contract . reiniorcing it,
in department chairman John Worn
ley’s words, “doubled in spades.”

The Philosophy student EPC hall
last Week recommended that Nas-
ser's anaryeai‘ terminal contract
be changed to a regular two-year
one, suoicct to review next tall The
Philosophy department in overturm
ing the EPC’s recommendation
sent a statement to the Executive
Council, along witti a copy oi the
EPC letter, which read as follows:

“The philosophy Department has
received the Student EPC letter
in regard to Mr Nasscr's teaching
and transmits it herewith to the
Executive Council The department
has given due consideration to the
EPC position. However, in viewing
Mr Nasscl"s overall contribution
to the department alid to the Cole
lege, we rcaliirni and, on balance,
reiuiorcc the original recommenda—
tion."

The statement was signed by Neal
Klausnet, Howard Burkle, Dennis
Haas, and Woriey

Nasser said the action “symbolizes
the whole college's attitude toward
student wishes. Namely, it ignores
them " Nasser Said the grounds {or
terminating his contract hadchanr
gcd. that when his leaching improv~
ed, "they invented Something else”
because of “thiei‘ eternal commit-
ment that they Wanted me out oi
here,"

Worley said that, although Nasser's
teaching had improved since the ori»
ginal recommendation andwas now
“above average," other factors had
sllilted and caused the recommendar

tioli to he ieaitirmed. nltlinugll on
diiiercnt gionuds. Noting that he
deiinod the word very hroadly, Woi»
ley said that Nasser “scholap
ship" had declined while his teach-
ing improved

The report which the EPC sent to
the philosophy Departmrnt, re~
ported in last week's SitB, urged
that Nassei he given a two year
contract to ltcrcvlewed next tall
The recommendation was hased on
a poll oi philosophy majors, who
had voted 2M to keep Nasser,
Thc EPC, llonever. made its re;
commendation solely on ihchasis at
teaching dlliliiy and did not consider
the other tliCtoi‘S, namely scholar-

a new philosophy department me-
thod or operation in which the EFC
evaluates teaching ability and the lite

' structors in the department evaluate

other criteria

According to Nasser, the den
partment had decided what its i'er
commendation would be even before
the poll of motors. “The depart-
ment’s mind was made up a long
time ago,” Nasser said, “and this
Student poll business all] the rhe-
toric oi student power is Just a
paciﬁer for the students."

Asked why the department would
be so lirmly set against him, Nasn
ser said he thought they just didn't
like radicals. At a recent meeting
he recalled, one member of the tie»
partmeni “sort of initiated at me
and accused me oi being an agitar
tor and an encourager oi these
student power people . . . sort oi
fanning the flames oi student disc
content."

“it’s the old Outside
argument," he added.
Worley said that considerations oi
scholarship had led the depart»
ment to its decision. Worley said
scholarship, especially for a philo-
sopher, was ”a very broad area”
which comprised not Only papersand
other academic concerns but “the
notions 0i philosophy in all one
does " Worley said Nasser's con,
duct in the debate over his contract
had not heen scholarly inthis sense.
"The mode at argument was not
appropriately scholarly in nature,"
he said ”The arguments were not
logical."

Wurley said that it would be diffir
Cult for the department to have a
“reapproachment at a scholarly
level," This, he Said, was partly
due to the Ltd hominem nature Di

he stressed that the department
was not acting out oi personal peer
vishness but hecause oi genuine
lapses iti Nasser’s philosophical
scholarship.

The 3&5 reported last week that
Nasser liad dectded to Sign his one
year contract, out this was apparent
1y an error, He is still being Conn
sidered tor openings at a couple
