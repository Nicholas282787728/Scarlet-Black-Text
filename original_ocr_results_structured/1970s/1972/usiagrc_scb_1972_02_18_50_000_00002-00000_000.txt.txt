LIBRARY “m ”96

on e
Staff.

Yesterday afternoon, Mr.
Thornton and members ofConcerned
Black Students (CBS) met for two
and oneehalf hours with students
and librarians at an open meeting
of the Libeary Committee.

A CBS spokesman, Russell McGre»
gor, outlined a proposal tor a Black
library which had been presented to
the committee Wednesday, stating
that “the concept rather than the
institution of the program is what
is important."

All members oi the library com—
mittee gave favorable reactions to
the concept of a Black library,
but Gerald Lalonde, Classical Lan-
guagues, said it would be “dange-
rous to give carte blanche aframe-
work that has the rubber stamp of
the library committee.

Dean Walker said that it was im-
portant that the proposal be dis-
cussed by the committee because the
proposal presented by CBS “Is of
much greater magnitude and broad
er scope” than what was agreed
to at the end of negotiations

1n postponing a decision on the spe
cifics of the proposal, committee
chairman Donald Irving emphasized
that it was “not a sweeping under
the table” of the proposals.

Head librarian Henry Alden told the
5&5 that in that meeting the lie
brary stall suggested to black stur
dents the Twentieth Century Room
as a black library and “they re-
fused to accept it as a possible
solution " He noted that the staff
“wanted to get started immediately
on the idea.”

Alden said the major costoia Black
library was that of recataloging all
the black studies books, quoting the
figure $20,000 and later revising it
to $5,000 to $10,000.

Students involved in clearing Out
the Twentieth Century Room of its
original holdings and putting black
studies books in it last night told
the SKIB that they were in effect
making easier tor the college what
the administration was reluctant to
do; Many offered to help with re-
cataloging.

“The implication we gut from all
(the meetings) was that there was a
manpower shortage," said student
Alan Wheat, "that they needed some
help in the establishment and relo-
cation of this material."

Another black student. Lawrence
Wright, said that the students on the
second floor of Burling were simply
implementing the agreement made
after negotiations last semester,

“At the moment we are establishing
the Black library that we negotiated
for last semester with the Trustees,
administration, and faculty," Wright
said.

Alden commented that he thought
it impossible for inexperienced stue
dents to catalog the collection, but
Wright replied, "I hate to over.
step his expertise, but we feel that
we might be intelligent enough to
eitectively catalog those holdlns.”
Students involved in the action went
through the regular shelves at the
library and picked out black studies
books to be taken to the Twentieth

graphed bibilographies of AfrtPAl‘fk

used them as a guide.

Shortly after the action began,
the SALE located Mr. Thornton in
the American literature section of
the library,

Thornton did not have a printed
bibliography, but was careiuIIy but
rapidly scanning each shelf for p0»
ssible contributions to the new Black
library.

Dean Walker and faculty chairman
Beryl Clotfelter located Thornton,
and Clotfelter asked him, “Are you
doing this, Virginius?”

Thornton replied that he was just
observing.

As Thornton continued searching
through the shelves and picking out
an occassional book or two, the 3&8
asked him about the Black library,
and what he was doing.

“I am browsing and putting things
into some sort oi logical order.
Which means, I'm sure, that I’ll
be fired. The chairman of the facu-
lty was up here and saw me brows»
ing and so did the Dean. So, I’m
Sure that I’ll get my contract abros
gated tomorrow.”

Thornton said that he did not help
organize the Thursday nightaction;
that it was spontaneous thing,

Clearly Thornton did not View the
Black library as his or the black
students' major concern,

“What this does illustrate is that
the patience of black students might
well be reaching its end and this
sort of contemptuous delay might
well cause black students to think
of more creative things to do to the
extent of all being expelled irom
School. I think that they’ve made
that deslsion . . .

“If any black student is kicked
out or iorced to leave I’m morrally
obligated to leave with them" Th-
ornton said.

He said later “I've got ten jobs
in my pocket right now so that's
no problem . . .I'm not going to
let black students do something
that I’m not going to be a part oixj
Though the action last nightl c1-
early had the support and partici-
pation of most blacks, at least two
were not in complete agreement,
Dean of Students Connie Kimbo eXr
pressed his disgust with Thornton,
saying, "And you're supposed to be
a professor "

As the blacks were leaving Burling
for the meeting in the Black Cul-
tural Center, black Student Al Ha-
mmond walked in with an astonished
look on his face, and muttered,
”This is it . . .You've got to be
insand.”

Blacks refused comment on the
proceedings of the closed CBS meet
ing held late Thursday night.

[mediate reaction of students in
the library was generally compla-
cent. Most students were unaware
of the neogtiations which had taken
place earlier in the aiternoon and
as a result were unsure of the ra»
tionale for the action. some stun
dents were unaware of the existence
of anything going on in the libary,
until approached by son reporters.

White students generally took a
rather light and unconcerned atti»

tude. Commented Dick Abrams: “It

Another student mention: “It’s sort

Senior Mark Tanaka said he belieVr
ed that the black action was a
“demonstration of strength” which
would “bring the fore” the black

problem and make la a “new, popuv

went in one hour and iorty minutes.

After the iirst sale at three dozen
chocolate chip cookies (baked by
Carol Patterson) went to Mr. Fisher
of the Chemistry Department (tor
$1.50), the size of the crowd and the
competitiveness oi the bidding went
up, The urge to get away irom SAGA
food induced tierce bidding for din-
ners offered by the faculty. The high-
est priced item, an Italian dinner for
ten offered by Mr. and Mrs. MCr
Kibben, went ior $90 to Jack Couch,
Also, the Hawaiian Celebration for
eight offered by Joyce Nakamura,

shido, AI Nakagawa, Carl Oshiro,
and Winnie Tamura, sold ior $27,

The exotic items on the agenda

were untortunately oiiered too late
tor indifferent students to bid com-
petitively on them, For example. a
coed skinnydip ior 16 girls offered
by the swim team turned out to be
an aiinir ior eleven girls and live
spectators. The package sold ior
only $15.50. An Indian dinner tor
five men oilered by the girls at 1332

Broad Street sold for only as, An— .

other Iranian (liliner went for only a

space to the highest bidder sold for
$41.

As the auction progressed, the size
of the crowd dwindled to about 75
from its onertime peak ofabout 400.
Bidding on the remaining items was
getting lackadaisical, and the
meeting was adjourned at ll:15 P M.

Dick Sears, the auctioneer, has
been in the business [or the past I5
years. Also a livestock dealer, he
has sold all over the United States,

New Oil-Campus
Study Program

by David Crow

lnterfuture is the name of the
college’s newest offrcampus study
program, designed to compare North
American Ideas and practices with
the views of one of the following
cultures: Ghana, the Netherlands,
Ireland, the United Kingdom, or an
Englishrspeaking nation in the
Caribbean. (It is possible to work
in English in all of these countries.)

The people selected each yearwork
under one broad theme such as
“Nationalism," “Man's Habitat,”
or, this year, "lnternationalism."
There is much flexibility as to sub
ject Within these general categories,
however; possible topics under this
year’s theme range irom peace
movements to multi-national cor—
porations.

Participants Will be selected in
the second semester oi their sopho-
more year, and will attend twoNorth
American conierences during the
iollowing summer to prepare their
projects The iirst semester of the
junior year is devoted to academic
preparation for the overseas study
which occurs during the iollowing
semester and, optionally, during
that next summer. Then, in the first
semester of his senior year back
home, the student relates his ex-
periences to his native environment,
and during the second semester acts
as a teaching assistant in a course
offered on his proyect,

The coordinator at the program is
James Magee, Political Science.
He sees the main benefits of the
program as ”the framework it pro»
vides ior in-depth independent study
both here and abroad," and the
logistics and academic support it
provides the student. A key feature
of the program is the ”recycling"
of the knowledge gained by the par-
ticipant in the course through which
he shares his findings.

Although the cost of the program
is relatively high, varying from
$1,550 to $3,175 depending upon
location, college financial as-
sistance is available.

Gills To College
Ahead 0t ’70-“

James Avison, Vice President for
Resources and Planning today an-
nounced that total gifts to the Col—
lege have reached $1,322,415.00,

$130,554.00 more than the total at
this time a year ago.

However, Avison noted that due to
the expiration of a mayor foundation
grant, unrestricted gifts total only
$404,901.00, more than $100,000.00
behind the total in January of 1971.

progress is being made in making
up this deficit, however, as alterna-
tive Iunding is sought. Avison also
noted that the Parent's Fund, which
has now surpassed the $12,000.00
mark, is normally placed in the
unrestricted category.

For 1971-72, the total budget is
$5,967,093. Of this amount, only

$3,298,100.00 is covered by tuition
and fees.

However, the iund has a new char
acter this year. Money irom the lund
will go toward the purchase oitrees,
planting, and shrubs, and toward
other expenditures resulting in gen-
eral campus beautification.
