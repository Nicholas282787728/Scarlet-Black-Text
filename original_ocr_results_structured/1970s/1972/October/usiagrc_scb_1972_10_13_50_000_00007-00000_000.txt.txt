ISPIRG formulated a mixed agenda
with testimony on consumerism,
housing, and health care presented
to a student panel and audience at
the Davenport public hearing on
Tuesday, October 3.

“For all practical purposes.
the area oi consumer protection in
Davenport is untouched..,the needis
there, but as yet the problem is
untouched," said Davenport Mayor
Kathy Kirschbaum. She proposedthe
establishment of a Consumer Coun-
cil made up or individuals and or-
ganizations to provide a clearing-
house ior consumer complaints.
Taking a statewide view of con»
sumer needs, DougCarlsoni‘romthe

and responsibilities or a renter.”
PAT offers such services as a free
“model” lease and iree legal ad-
Vice.

Ryan noted that renters often have
had diiiiculty in securing the return
oi damage deposit money. “We’ve
about turned the corner. Landlords
think twice (now) beiore they pocr
ket that money, thinking they may
have to explain it in court,..”.

Health maintenance Organizations
were viewed by Marvin Borschd as
effective means to serve the health
needs of local communities. He

termed the essential concept as one
oi promoting “preventative medlr

cine", and envisioned theidealHMO
as a “...one door, one stop fa-
cility with everything {win an eye
doctor to a social worker.”

The body of candidate for state
representative Tom Higgens’ pre
sentation was directed toward drug
abuse, in which he foundthat “we’re
rushing to the ramparts with band»

aids.,.much of the money ls being
misspent.”

Referring to Alvin Tofﬂer’s Future
shock, Higgens related drug abuse
as a symptom of a social ailment—-

 

Throughout the recent public hearings ISPIRG has received
numerous project proposals and suggested diets ior eiiective
action. Mrs. Mabel Robbins’ advice at last week's Davenport
hearing was quite succinct: “We need to work on the legislators.
They put the grease where the wheel squeaks, and it you squeak

enough, you’ll get the grease.“

A two-day ISPIRG state board conference to define research
priorities and to establish specific projects is slatedfor November
4-5. The weekend will mark a turning point, a transition from a
focus on internal organization to a commitment to action, lSPIRG

will soon be squeaking.

the lack or hope engendered by the
decline of stabilizing societal ele-
ments. He iraced roots of the prob-
lem to “the sinking irrelevance of
what we’re learningin the education
at system The quality or the educa~
tional System is still aboutthe same
as so years ago, despite iuture
shock."

An additional perspective was
placed upon the issues oiconsum-
erism, housing, and health care by
the testimony ui Don Bowman and
three elderly witnesses Irom the
Prevretil'ement Center in Des
Moines

Ms. Mable Robbins stressed that,
“Consumerism is so important to
determine whether these people go
on welfare or can stay in their own
homes and live in dignity. Theydon’t
want to go on welfare because they
don’t want to lose their property.”
Acceptance of Old Age Assistance
turns property rights over to the
state, which is “mentally dev~
astating” to the elderly, said How-
man.

Bowman felt that Carlson's cons
cept of an educated consumer is an
especially important need ofthe eld-
erly. ”We must find some means of
an eﬂective educational program to
equip these people in a lasting way
as consumers.”

ISPIRG’S role in helping to dealwith
problems raised at the hearing was
discussed by many witnesses. Jeane
Tester of the Iowa City chapter of
the Iowa Consumers League re-
ferred to a letter published in the
Daily Iowan in which the author ex-
pressed the feeling that ISPIRG was
unnecessary because voluntary con—
sumer interest groups (such as Mrs.
Tester’s) could handle the problem,
Mrs. Tester disagreed She felt that
her organization was only a temr
porary answer to a pressing need,
that consumer interest groups lack
coordination, To ISPIRG she said:
“Full it together, ,I have done all I
can Now its up to you ..

STUDENT LOANS CLARIFIED

The Office of Education recently issued a seriesof statements attempting

to clarify the current status of the Guaranteed Student Loan Program.
Emergency legislation, passed August 19 and eiiective until March
I, 1973, enables lenders to make loans under the same regulations that
governed the Program prior to June 30.

Students may borrow up to $1500 per year from participating banks
and financial institutions. Loans are guaranteed by a State or private
nonprofit guarantee agency or insured by the Federal Governmentii
adjusted family income is less than $15,000 per year, the Federal cove
ernment pays interest on the loan while the recipient is in school, Re»
payment begins within one year of the completion of school, and must be
completed within a period oi iive to ten years.

Repayment may be deferred for up to three years ior recipients in the
military, Peace Corps, VISTA, or for recipients who return to lullrtime
study.

students who applied for loans under the rules in etiect irom June so _
to August 19 are eligible to apply tor a new loan or an additional amount
ii they: were denied a loan because, based on an analysis ofneed,the
school made no recommendation; were denied the interest subsidy,
although family income was less than $15,000; waived the Interest sub-
sidy in order to get a loan; or received an insuiiicient amount as a re»
sult of the school’s analysis of need.

Ii, under the present rules, a student is eligible to receivealoan,
the Federal Government has no objection to his using the proceeds to
repay a previous unsubsidized loan received during the June 30 to August

19 interim period.
Further Information is available through the Financial Aid foIce.

we possibly could

from various quarters about the vis-
IbIIity problem of the Cabinet offi—
cers, Gorrell commented, “Idon’t
think that it is a criticism at all,
They are doing the work. They are
available to talk to people at any
time it people are interested. They
do make regular reports to the Board
and to the student body, As (SGA
president) Russ (McGregor) put it,
they simply aren’t on the power
ego trip. They’re simply a group 01
people getting things done.”

At a Joint Board meeting a few
weeks ago, several Presidents comr
plained that the Calumet was exclude
ing the House presidents in many
SGA matters. Concerning their plea
it» more responsibility, Gorrell
noted, “I think Greg Dickey put It
really well when he brought up the
point that responsibilities are not
ours to give.” Gorrell's adviceto the
House Presidents Is: “If you want
responsibility, take th initiative."
Gurrell added the cri cisln that
House Presidents possessed a ”re,
stricted VIewpoint.” At that same
meeting last week, Curt said,
“Somebody got really ticked Off and
said, ‘My students are not con-
cerned with pin ball machines, they
want the dog shit picked up the iloorx
Well, that really bothers me. That
person is really concerned with one

Twenty?”

One of the issues Curt would like
to see the House Presidents pub»
llclze is ISPIRG, Transportation has
been available to the public hearings
held throughout the stale for the past
several weeks--and will be available
ior the upcoming hearings~but. with
the exception ol the Drake hearing,
he reporied, the cars have never
been more than half full.

“After all the high idealism and
principles I‘ve heard espoused at
this college {or ‘so long Ido not
know why We do not have 1200 names
on that petition," he said, The ref-
erence was to the petition fora charv
ter membership In ISPIRG that, as of
this week, has about 625 signatures.

“Education Is valueless unless it
has a direct input in the SOCIety
in which you live. It does you no
good to sit in ii classroom and stuff
(acts and figures in your head if
you're never going to use them for
anything. The best education is that
which combines a working knowledge
oi things you‘ve learned. a foundar
tion of knowledge, and then you can
apply it in a constructive way to
things going on in the community
around you.“

That kind oI educational experlr
ence WhIch ISPIRG offers Is just
attractive enough to make a guy
