ETALAGE 0! ICE

Your iew whispered words

are to me as errant vapors liiting
irom the topmost crusts and crags

oi your iagged iceberg, cold and tloatmg
still in a Still sea, water as steam

in quiet sublimation

melted and drawn away by any briei
moment’s burst oi hot sun. You

are quick to (eel and not know why.
The deep green portion or your glacial
buoy still hides untouched in unreal
virgen calm unseen below the seas
suriace You light blindly to preserve
your oottomheaviness. i know

my physics, enough to (eel profound
respect {or Archimedes' laws it
isn't simple to dare one sharp
moment oi deiiance and disregard the
everyday houyancy you cultivate and
nurture and cling to in jaundice. Small
projection on top bobbing, you keep
the bulk below in safe dark waters,
This leaves me cold and alone outside,
I beg you in your own way invert

the awesome ice mass turning

in a topsey-turvey turn upending

and ilaunt it rump up to the sun,

Hurry my love, tor the noontime draws
nearer, whose iierce

searing rays will thaw what lies above
and leave you a pool oi yourseli, in

a lost amalgam in the salt sea. Hurry
my love, you must know the sea will
not he moved by your pittance

of warm tears! Hurry -

the hour and my soul cry

ior an etalage oi ice!

THE ZELDA WOMAN

She’s a dreamer and

The dream and

There is a wall,
Observed a cat,
And over it she sprang.

Marc Talbert

Her net is iurled wide open, tor
She never tires oi building

Mountains

with her king a newemet man.
And her dreams become

His future and

His hopes ior all tomorrows,
But her dreams are not

Her future and

She leaves her men in
Sorrow, though as

alien as she does it

She loves each and every kingdom in
A gentle type or manner and

All her iallen hero kings were

Once her soul's creation and

She lived Within their bodies and
Their minds were once her pasture,
When she’s dreaming at another,
May she never

Smile at you,

For she’s a princess in a tower that
No dream can e’re unlock,

orange davenport

i love your warmth as
my cold body sinks
into your ﬂesh and
melts

but no lover is loving me
for

i am alone

in life

i am alone

and

orange davenport is my
lover is my soul is my

god is my king and knight in
armour oh save me orange
and i Will love your davenport

Betsey naniorth

how am I going
to let you know
I’m not coming,

I can not leave

this place

this sadness. these troubles.
this winter

knowing I can not come

to meet you yet

not until the new year begins
makes the coldness harder
to live with

you might be gone

be somewhere else

by then

others may want to come

still, I Can't run away

.l am always looking hack

I keep everything

in boxes

hidden away. waiting ior me,
to open them

the boxes are full
with letters past memories.
and pictures of dreams in a drawer

knowing that

l remember them

they are there,

looked away, waiting ior me.

sometimes I Can’t leave
because of those boxesi

they keep everything in me.

I emptied all of them days ago
and now, with so little time left

l’il come
looking ior you myseli
