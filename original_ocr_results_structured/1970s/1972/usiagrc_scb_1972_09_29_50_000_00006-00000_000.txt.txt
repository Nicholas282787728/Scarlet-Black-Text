We invited a few friends for dinner
and they helped clean up the Genesee River.

With the aid of a few thousand pounds or microorga-
nisms, we’re helping to solve the water pollution problem in
Rochester. Maybe the solution can help others,

What we did was to combine two proeesses in a way
that gives us one oi the most omeient water-purifying sys-
tems private industry has ever developed.

One process is called “activated sludge,” developed
by man to accelerate nature’s microorganism adsorption
What this means is that {or the majority or wastes men can
produce, there is an organism waiting somewhere that will
happily assimilate it. And thrive on it

The breakthrough came when Kodak scientists iound
away to combine the aetivated sludge process with a trickling
ﬁlter process and optimized the combination.

We tested our system in a pilot plant for ﬁve years.

(At Kodak, we were working on environmental improvement
long before it made headlines.) And the pilot project worked
so well, we built a ten-million-dollar plant that Can purify
36rmillion gallons of water a days

Governor Rockefeller called this ”the biggest volun-
tary project undertaken by private industry in support of
New York State’s purErwater program."

Why did we do it? Partly because we’re in business to
make a proﬁteand clean water is vital to our business. But in
furthering our own needs, we have helped further society’s.
And our business depends on society.

We hope our efforts to cope with water pollution will
inspire others to do the same. And, we’d be happy to share
our waterrpurilying information with them. We all need clean

water. So we all have to work together.

More than a busmess.
