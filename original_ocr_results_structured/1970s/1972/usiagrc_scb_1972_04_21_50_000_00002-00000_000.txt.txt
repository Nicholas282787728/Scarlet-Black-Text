attempt to formulate plans to be

presented at the Monday evening
meeting

The meeting began with discussion

of possible “viable alternatives" to

a mass Des Moines demonstration.
CiVll disobedience, such as a guer-
illa theatre, was advocated by one
speaker who suggested that the group
either black major sidewalks iii
downtoun Des Moines and demon~
strate guerilla theatre to passers-hy
or "invade" a Des .VIOlnes high
school with a guerilla theatre group.
This latter suggestion was made af—
ter it was learned that a North Viet-
namese high school was supposedly
bombed by American planes.

After further discussion oftacllcs,
Mr. Nasser took the floor to express
his views on the issue. He inquired
whether those assembled were
satisfied with the present leader-
ship. “I'm dissatisfied - I've seen
them in action and it could be a bad
thing”, He added that his disagree
ment was political, not personal. He
concluded that the people wanted
militant action, but the leaders did
not.

Someone observed that “We don't
want to be labeled as just a student
group - we should involve the Whole
town ”

Another student noted, however,
that much of the college campus lie
self was apathetic to wind was going
on. He said that it would be neCESr
sary to “kick student‘s asses out of
their apathy" and suggested that
activists go into lounges, pull the
plug on the TV. and then talk about
the war in Southeast Asia.

Many participants felt that a student
strike would be an ineffective mea-
sure; that it would alienate much oi
the student body and faculty and pro
.bably do little good.

Mr. Nasser disagreed, citing a for
cent article by Clark Clifford which
stated that fear of strident strikes
had stayed the hand of both the John
son and Nixon Administrations from
escalating the war several times in
the past" He also cited statements
from Madame Blhh which purported
to show tne effectiveness of student
strikes.

Monday Evening

The Monday night Herrick meeting
drew over 00 people at its peak
Phil Sasich opened the meeting and
was retained as its chairman by ac~
clamation. He turned the floor over
to Shelley Floyd, who summarized
the events so far She noted that at
that time tlte only major protest in
iowa was one involving 1,000 stu-
dents at Iowa Stale in Ames anda
Des Moines demonstration planned
by Drake University for Tuesday
morning at the downtown Federal
Building.

Shelley also brought the first ole
ficial announcement of the NSA call
for a one-day strike on Friday to
protest the war, and thhe national
demonstration day which was set for
Saturday She added that strike votes
were being taken across the country,
and that Amherst was already out on
strike.

Art Andrews then took the floor with
the first of the evenings proposals,
He said that "a demonstration is a
one-shot thing" but that the gitiup
“want(s) action to move politicians
and the masses" He suggestcda
massive letterrwrltlng clll.ipaign

The Scarlet and Black

with each student writing to his Con-
gressional representatives, adding
that ii the demonstration was coor-
dlnated so that “500 typewriters
were pounding away on Central Cam—
pus" it could very well get excellent
media coverage,

Three alternatives for a mass de-
monstration were then presented.
One would involve a demonstration
in Ames on Saturday, where the
Democratic State Convention is be»
ing held, which would provide almost
automatic media coverage and
speakers and would also be coor-
dinated with the national day of
demonstrations

A Second suggestion tor a Des
Moines demonstration on Saturday
would still be coordinated with the
national efforts, but it would not be
aimed at any specific party.

The third proposal, a Sunday
demonstration, would allow an extra
day ior planning, but would not be a
part oi the coordinated nationwide
demonstration To some, however,
this could be seen as an advantage,
since a Grinnell demonstrationSuns
day would require separate media
coverage instead of being lost in a
long list of Saturday events. Action
on all three proposals was tabled by
acclamation until further informa—
tion could be available and other
alternatives discussed.

Steve Ginzbarg proposed an eXr
tended last, in which participants
would Sign a petition saying that
after a speciﬁc date they would not
eat until the War ended. After seve
eral minutes of discussion, his pro-
posal, too, was tabled lor later cone
sideratinn.

Greg Thielinan then rose to speak
to the philosophy oiproposed action.
"Any action should remind people in
a visible way that something is going
on in Southeast Asia that shouldn’t
be going on " He added that appar—
ently President Nixon felt he could
do anything he wanted in Viet Nam
without arousing any kind of public
reaction Any action should be de-
signed to destroy that illusion

David Abel, Mu5ic, proposed a
tactic which he said had been very
effective in San Francisco several
years ago. A group should, he said,
go to the Federal Building in Des
Moines and there stage a silent tast
tor a week, This tactic alienates
almost nobody, he claimed, and it
opens up lines of cummunication,

Alan Nasser, another of the seve
eral faculty members present atihe
meeting, rose to support a strike on
Friday. He cited evidence [roni Such
diverse sources as Clark Clifford
and Mme. Einh to support his argu»
merit that student strikes areatnong
the most ellective protest weapons
available at institutions of higher
education,

“We know the kind of tactic which
frightens the power Structure“, he
said, lie urged the students assem-
bled in Herrick to seriously consi-
der a strike as an alternative, since
to him it was the most effective ac~
tion yct suggested

But many students disputed the
Nasser vicw . especially those who
had been at Grinnell during the 1970
strike. LorenHart commented .“Nut
all students are going to be right-0n
for a strike” and added that he felt
a strike would polarize a large pore
tion of the student body and most of
the taculty, What is needed is soil»
(larity, not polarization, he felt.

Discussion on this point continued
inr some time, with the two oppos—

lnio Center Coordinates Efforts

by Merry Wiesner

During bursts of campus activism,
the most dominant feeling is one of
bewilderment at the plethora of ace
tivities going on all around Renliz»
ing that the campus community
needed a source of accurate infor-
mation as to yust What was going on,
Jack Doppelt and several others set
up the Information Center for anti-
war activities, located in the Forum
Basement.

Founded alter the Sunday evening
meeting. the Information Center gar
thers information from all the come
mittees and distributes it to 13 plae
ces in the 'ampus community in the
form of mimeographed bulletins. it
then releases it to KDIC andthe SKlB.
Phones are manned from 8 in the
morning to midnight, receiving about
10 to 20 calls an haul, Offering help

and requesting information,

Besides this public service
function, the Information Center
serves as a coordinating unit, in
contact with the National Student
Association headquarters in Chicago
and peace and dralt centers through-
out the nation, and keeping abreast
with national developments. Along
with receiving information, it sends
out news olactivity on campus to both
AP and UPI, along With the Grinnell
Herald—Register and the College Re-
lations Office. It also coordinates
on—campus efforts, minimizing dup-
lications oi activuy and assuring
that vital items aren’t left out in
planning.

Jack Doppelt comments that the
Center also serves as an adVisory
committee, assuring that new ideas
are brought out into the open.

AN SW E R5 7 meeting in llcrrick.

mg Vieupoints tossing the same
arguments hack mid loith. Tlieli,
several students who had attended
the earlier Nasser meeting brought
up two oi the proposals i‘uisctl there:
guerilln theatre in Des Monies high
schools and streets, and smnll
groups getting class time to speak
about the war.
Another student suggested that
"Grinneil has its very own draft
board, and as far as i know, nothing
has ever been done to obstruct it.
Maybe it's time to change that .,
Chairman Phil Saslch suggested
that the proposals so far presented
be divided into lonr categories
strike action, demonstrations, lasts,
and civil disobedience l-loiievel'.
Clayton Lee pointed out that there
were only [we real kinds ofnl‘tion:
a strike, which should be put to an
all campus referendum, anddemone
strations, lasts, and civil disobede
ience, all oi which were ltctioiis

Attention therefore turned to the
devising of an opinion poll to be
distrihuted to all members or the
gtudent body Wednesday,,; asking
whether or not a strike should occur
The primary question concerned
student support torn oneednystrike,
and an added query asked students
if they would support a longer strike
if such an action were indicated
Following a number oiamendments
and a good deal of confusion over
exactly what the referendum has
designed to accomplish, the group
voted both by acclalnation nnd by a
show of hands to approve the opinion
poll
Alter even more discussion. a mo—
tioii was made that those assembled
in Herrick "call for a strike along
the guidelines set lorth by NSA”
By an overwhelming show of hands

Wednesday Evening
The committees and ideas of TiIeSr
day and Wednesday were called to~
gether in a 10 00 meeting Wednesday
night in Herrick chapel. Phil Sasich.
again Chairman, noted that tho phi»
pose was to determine action, not to
“dwell too long on metaphysical or
philosophical implications."
Mike Fitzgerald picscnicd the For
suits of the strike opinion stll'vev.
in which 67% of the campus turned in
ballots or these, the vole was 38
to 236 in favor ofa one-titty strike
Friday and 391 to 373 in iavoi of
possible continuation into longer
strike action.

John Pieffer announced that the
Joint Board had also endorsed the
onerddy strike action by at 127571
vote, and had endorsed an antl»war
SAGA last on Friday night (with
certain stipulations) by a 13-373
vote.

Sign up sheets for the fast were
immediately circulated. Whenit was
explained that only 51; per partici-
pant was given by SAGA, one student
suggested holding the fast on Satur-
day night. However, Saturday lasts
raise exactly the same Sic per per-
son, and Sasich noted that “dedicated
revolutionaries that we are, we don’t
like to miss our Steaks.”

Activities correlated with the city
of Grinnell were then discussed. A
much involving townspeople, cane
vassing in the town, and information
booths downtown had all been pro
posed, but Michele Conway ad
dressed the meeting on the possible
dangers of moving into the town and
trying to “push” onto the townspeor
pie college ideas about the War, Such
action would do no good, and possibly
could cause a great deal of harm.

Bill Thomas agreed, adding that
“It‘s easy to go out and tell other
people about their problems. We
have to solve our own problems. We
don't have to go missionarying to the
towni” Both speakers received loud
applause.

Al Rosenfield then outlined a
revised schedule of events for Fri-
day. The day of the strike would
begin with a silent march around
the town starting lrom central cam-
pus at 7.30 a.m. Rosenfield emphar
sized that there would be no efforts
to "drag" people along who didn’t
want to come, After considerable
discussion, the assembled approved
the idea of a silent walk downtown

Scott Weil then presented a pro-
posal lor a 1/2 page antirwar ad in
the Des Momes Sunday Register
Silcli an ad would, he asserted, be
the most effective and least expen-
sive means of reaching the largest
number of Iowans with the unified
message ol Grinnell College against
the war

Several students expressed disape
pi‘Uval at the sheer amount olmoney
involved, arguing that the money
could be better spent on relief for
war viciiins A compromise motion,
for a 1/4 page all costing $1100.00
with anv additional money going to
the American Friends Service Com-
mitteejwas narrowly passed by a
99789 sllow of hands vote. Bill Thnr
mas will head ii separate fund for
Vietnamese relief

Discussion then turned to other an,
pronches to the city ol Grinnell.
Alter considerable debate, a pro-
posal was passed whereby activities
would remain primarily on the cam-
pus but with town participation in-
viteti Grinnell students also planned
to contact local civic leaders op-
posed to the war to see if college
students could assist in town»spon-
sored programs

The Grinncll Herald—Register
pliilincii to run an article on the
events at the College, which would, in
the words or one student, help to
nlliiy the towns fear of violent action
at the college. A group of Students
stayed lillcl' the meeting to help write
the article

Ai’t Andrews explained the second
nniioi item on the Friday agenda .
1i typewritnig "lellei' to your Cone
grcssninn" campaign to be carried

out on central campus between 1:00
and 2:30 Friday afternoon

A rally in Central Park was the
main item ofthe Saturday plan, After
more discussion of possible impact
on the town, it was agreed bya show
of hands that the rally would be held
at 1:30

Scott Wellmaii explained the Inter
faith Service [or Peace, which will
be held Sunday at 7‘00 pm, in the
Congregational Church (United
Church of Christ) Five area mine
isters, each of a different denomlr
nation, will take part in leading the
service, which will be open both to
students and townspeople In addition
to the worship, there will be an abs
breviaied performance of the
Catonsville Nine given during |he
service College students also
planned to make brief appearances
belore urea congregations to explain
their position on the war and an-
nounce the services.

Jenna Finch and Shelley Floyd dis-
cussed tlie various Des Moines doe
monstrations in which Grinnell stu-
dents might wish to take part. The
first will be a protest of Robert
Dale’s appearance at Drake Univer-
sity on Friday evening, Shelley em-
phasized that those participating
would have to be willing to work in
DES Moines both Thursday and Fri—
day, and would have to be “discreet”
in their activities.

Saturday morning at 1000, the
WIND Welfare Mothers plan a pro-
test march, They would welcome
Grinnell support, provided the prir
mary purpose was weltare rights
and the secondary purpose an anti
war demonstration Jenna pointed
out that the War was the cause of
much oi the welfare mother’s prob-
lems.

A rally had been scheduled for
a pm Sunday in Des Moines, but
the group planning it cancelled out
because of lack of time to muster
what they ran would be adequate
support. The Des Moines group
planned to concentrate their efforts
on the May 4 moratorium instead.
and the Herrick meeting endorsed
Grinnell’s support of that decision,

Jenna also announced that Luther
College students in Decorah had
formed ayvery elticient intcrmalion
gathering and dissemination service
called the.I Midwest Conspiracy to
Save Lives. She urged Grinnell in»
put into that group as an alternative
to forming a separate (and essentie
ally unneeded) group at Grinnell

Finally, a steering committee was
appointed to oversee all aspects ol
the anti~war movement, and also
to administer money from the SAGA
fast. SGA had stipulated that a mem-
her of the cabinet must be in this
group, and alter some confusion,
it was agreed that Terry Woli would
serve in that capacity.

The meeting nominated and elected
Jenna Finch, Joe Genereux, Susan
Arshack, Clayton Lee, Jim Diers,
Jim Jacobs, and Jack Conch as the
ongoing Steering Committee, and,
after a brief summary of times and
places, adyourned.

Thursday

The Steering Committee went into
action Thursday, planning a
schedule of lilms, speakers, and
discussions for Friday; finalizing
the route for the march from Grin-
hell to the High School and back;
and preparing tor the culminating
rally tomorrow in Central Park.

Meanwhile, both President Leggeii
and the SGA Joint Board issued
statements Thursday concerning toe
day‘s strike. Leggett commented
that he was pleased with the tone of
the activities planned, and asked
"the community to give them their
understanding and the benefit of an
exchange of VieWS, The campus is
and will continue to be open, and
our interaction with the city com-
munity remains and will remain
undisturbed "

The SGA statement again empha-
sized the voluntary nature of the
strike and the activities related to
it, and urged the respect of all
members of the college community
both for those who did or did not
take part in the strike

in addition to the strike, plans
were formulated for four lecturer
discussions The War’s Effects on
Vietnamese Culture in the morliing,
and The Philosophy and Practice of
Civil Disobedience, ProtestatGrinr
nell: 1970 and 1972, and Religious
Pacifism in the afternoon, An after
noon series of antirwar films, in-
cluding Once Upon a War, was also
scheduled,
