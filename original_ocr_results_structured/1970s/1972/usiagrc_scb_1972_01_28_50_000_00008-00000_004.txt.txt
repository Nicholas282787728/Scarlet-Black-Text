I’m in favor of a multi-
party system . . .

say from the left; and Humphrey cutting into
him, and it’s quite conceivable that no one
will go into the convention with more than
400 votes. This is further complicated -- you
saw David Broder’s column in the “RegiSr
ter” last week about how the new open con~
vention of the Democrats is going to give
all sorts oi advantages to the Wallace peo»
ple, and he suggested that it is conceivable
it not possible that Wallace himself can go
into the convention with as many as two
hundred votes, So I think that there seems
to be a disagreement as to what will nap»
pen. My own private assessment tor what
it’s worth is that Muskie has got it stalked.

Hottois: I think your assessment is cor-
rect. Muskie has Clearly set himself up
as the candidate to be stopped. He’s pulled
in a fair number of the cookies in terms
at organized support. The big ”if” this
year has got to he the primaries, because
the primaries under the new convention
rules are so important.

Moore: I think that is the point of Hughes'
endorsement ol Muskie, and others’ too,
But it what you suggest happens, and Mus»
kie doesn't go in as the front runner, then
the convention is going to split and Humph-
rey is going to be the man who’ll have a
majority. .

Hottois: Yes, Humphrey has a severe dis—
advantage though, Ed. He's got a laser’s
image going,

Moore: 1 hope he keeps it, too. But he got
it in 1963 without a single primary. II he
gets it started, unless its blocked at the
Convention, it seems to me that a lot of
the candidates who voted for him in 1968 are
going to be there.

Gilmour: Did you see what Kennedy said
just the other day? The word I had train
people in the slate of Florida who are pretty
close to the Kennedy organization there said
that he wants to keep his options open. He
does not want to be put in the situation 01'
being draited ii it appears that Nixon cannot
be beaten.

sols; How signiticant do you think the cut»
Ierences between Muskie and Humphrey
are? You’ve all mentioned that you preier
Muskie to Humphrey. It’s been suggested,
at least by Senator McCarthy recently,
that Muskie may be Humphrey all over
again.

Hottois: in some ways,

SﬂE: Well, there’s some evidence {or it.
Humphrey was the person who picked Mus—
kie. Muskie got into the limelight because
of this, and really the only distinction that
he gained was the contrast with Spiro Agnew.
Muskie was the person who fought lor the
pro—LBJ VietsNam plank at the Chicago
Convention. He was the lead person in that
debate,

Moore: I think that part at this is who can
heat Nixon. I just think that Humphrey might
be a disastrous deieat and Muskie might
have a chance.

sun: ldeologicaliy, is Muskie Humphrey
all over again, though?

Orr: Well, Muskie says that he was wrong
about the war.

8&8: So did Humphrey, didn’t he, at Salt
Lake City in 1968? He said at least he
tavored a diiierent proposal than he did
earlier in the campaign.

Gilmour: As iar as the tacts are concerned,
I don’t know that there is that much dit-
terence. I think it you were to analyze the
legislative records in the Senate of the two
men, Humphrey will come out measurably
better. In tact, the assertion has been made
that there is no man in this century that has
authored more progressive social and do—
mestic legislation, than Humphrey.

I’m merely pointing out that in the past he
has a solid domestic record that is un~
paralleled, including Lyndon Johnson or
anyone else. I think he became a partner
with Johnson, and I just think he’s passe
now. There's no point in considering him,

Moore: on, I think ll Humphrey’s nomi-
nated there’s no question that there'll be
a iourth party.

Hottois: I think that also related to this
is the sort of image which Humphrey pro—
lects. He tends to project the image that
Nixon was accusing Kennedy of having be»
fore the debates. You get a feeling when
you watch Hubert Humphrey on TV thathe’s
a teenybopper that’s never quite grown up.
I agree entirely with Ed in terms of his
domestic record: it’s fantastic.

Orr: WelI he's got the same problem
probably that Muskie has in that he doesn't
have a great appeal in some ways, I mean
the same kind of appeal that say Harold
Hughes has to the public here in Iowa,

Honois: Muskie presents a strong image,
which it you’re thinking of image politics,
which we may have a good deal 0!, he

presents much more than a Hubert Hum-
phrey does; probably a much more human
sort of image than Richard Nixon.

Gilmour: And here’s a real danger ior
academicians, students and laculty alike,
to measure Presidential candidates against
their own expectations and wishes. Cer-
tainly the intellectual community is not
going to determine this election. The typi~
cal man in the street 77 I think there’s
plenty of evidence —- responds to the image
of honesty, Iortllrightness, stability and
strength that Muskie presents. You remem-
ber in the 1970 campaign that Muskie was
chosen to answer the Nixon last minute
appeal and the contrast was positive and
most persuasive.

Hottois: Muskie can draw very strongly
on his ethnic background. we don’t get
this in lawn, but it you go into a commun-
ity like Bulialo ,, I was back in Buitalo
at Christmas time ,. which is a Polish
community or at least Polish dominated
community, there are stories in the paper
like Ed Muskie’s Mom and Dad got married
in such»and-such a church here.

Gilmour: I suggest that his Catholic back—
ground is going to be heipiul, too.

Houois: It ain't golng to hurt.

Gilmour: N0. Certainly in the center cities.
I just think that Nixon at this stage is
unbeatable.

Moore: I think he’s very beatahlel
Gilmour: I hope you're right.

Moore: In 'fact, I think that if Nixon is
reelected It’s going to be the Democrats
that reelect him, the way they did in 1963,

8&8: Could you compare Muskie and Mc-
Govern to some extent: their strengths,
their support and where they are vulnerable;
and then, alter we’ve done with that id like
to get into the substance ot their ideology,
why they are good, why they are not good.

Muskie presents a strong
image . . .
