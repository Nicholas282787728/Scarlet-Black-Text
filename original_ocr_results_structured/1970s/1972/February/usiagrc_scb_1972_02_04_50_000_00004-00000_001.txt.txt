Grinnell’s literary Craftsmen

by John Wylie

ideas waiting within Grinnell students burst
forth in the form oi poetry and prose. This
supplement contains examples of the work
some students have produced this year. In
the words of John R. Keebie, Grinnell's
Writer-in-Residence, writing
something which is bursting out from the
inside outside of yourself”.

How do Grinnell's authors translate that
"something inside themselves” into some
thing which can appear on the printed page?
We talked to a number ofthem, andtheii‘ ideas
spread across a wide range or experience.

John Hesshurg, a Grinnell treshman, has
been writing poetry since the nuns who ran
his grade school asked him todo workior the
PTA Newsletter. He worked on the literary
magazine in high school, sharpening his writ-
ing skills.

“It takes a lot ofetiorttoget an idea i think
hard about the events of the day - its a stream
or consciousness thing. ideas start to term,
then relationships among the ideas, images
come from these ideas. A poem starts out as
a formiess rock. I chip away atthe rock until
there is something worthwhile there",

Warm teelings, especially towards newly
made friends, Often inspire John to begin
work He likes to go into his room and sur-
round hil'nselt' with classical or Chamber
music, which he finds helps him reach the
proper mood to write, Then, he begins the
chain or thought and eventually the writing

Poems are not tinished, static things to
John, They mature as he matures. “A good
poem grows with you because it is a part or
you". Thus, poems written several years ago
are now all but unrecognizable, although they
are still based on the same Chitin of images;
the same “rock”.

BetseyDaniorth, a senior, uses poetry to
express personal teelings which she can't
express any other way. She began writing
poetry as a freshman at the University of
lowa, where new experiences and a good deal
or tree time combined in creating a desire
to write

Since then, she has cased moods of depres—
sion by writing When she is loucly, she uses
poetry as a way oi "talking to someone when
there is no one there The paper can Soak up
your problems when you don’t want to impose
on someone else".

' Writing is fin emotional release r through
it 1 can pour out something that is inside me.
It's almost like Crying". When she becomes
involved in the idea and creation of a poem,
she tinds that she is completely unrespon»
sive to anything going on around her instead,
she finds herself a part of the special mood
which the poem She is creating has manor
factored around her,

Any place that is relatively quiet serves as
a location tor writing. However, she preters
the cemetery “Quiet and peace are the main
marks at the cemetery, The knowledge that
no one Will disturb you, and the beautiful tranr
qullity make it a wondertul place to concenr
trate ”

is ”getting ,

Long walks are another source ofinspirae
tion. “I should learn to take along a pen and
paper when i go on long walks inthe country.
otten, I‘ll have to memorize a poem l'vejust
created so that I can write it downwhen i get
home.”

The different locations do have some eitect
on the content or the poems. "The poemsl
write out in the country have a diiierentrhy-
turn to them , a walking rhythm.lcan always
pick out those poems because of the way they
flow.”

Lonely, introverted people are those who
are most likely to write poetry, she says in
eiiect, the poems serve as a form or sell
treatment to soothe the ache oi loneliness.
Certainly,Eetsey uses them to reveal ieelr
ings to herseli and others that she cannot
tlnd any other way to express and to release
hemmed in emotions.

Science majors would not normally be
thought or as poets. But,Betseyis both “I
plan to go into some hranch oi medicine when
i am through. Actually, medicine and poetry
are closely related. both are connected with
knowing and observing people.”

She plans to go into either psychiatry or a
general practice , “a very tamily kind of
rural doctor”. She certainly explodes the
myth that poets live in a selt created but im-
practical dream world.

Alon Bensley, also a Senior, is neither a
dre. n»worl(l resident or a strictly part time
writer "Poetry is a cratt," he says,and as
such he feels a good deal oi energy must be
expended in creating good pieces

The most important task tor a poet is de-
veloping his personal voice, "A good poem
writes itsell, but you write the poem It’s all
involved in developing a voice ryou get caught
in the “tone" ot your voice You're writing
well when you've lound your voice ln tinding
his voice, a poet develops certain teachnioues
which he has talents towards - he speaks a
language native to the poetic part othim, that
part which can be articulated through the
poem AS he gets better, he speaks more and
more in that voice "

Alan wants to continue in the literary lield
in some way. He has applied to sum at Bui-

talo tor their graduate English program.
Eventually, he hopes to teach English. “i
would be very amenable to becoming a poet
in residence at a college, if lcould find
a job as one ”

Writers have many opportunities to pre—
sent'their works: At Grinnell, five writers
and five artists, under the direction of Mr.
Keeble and Mr. Klein, have the opportunity
to take their works from the idea to the
printed page themselves.

Le Corps Exquisites is the title given to
the fourrcredit special topic in Which all are
participating. Centered around a turnrofr
the century hand printing press found in
Mr. Keeble’s basement, the course is de
Signed to give the writers a true “t'eel”
for their medium,

Each author is expected to Write at least
one piece oi poetry or prose for the assemv
blage which will be the end result of the
project. individual authors will be expected
to hand-set the type [or their work once
it is,pi'oduced This will give the authors
something or the “physical aspect oi using
language" according to Keeble.

l-lopetully, but setting and printing their own
works, the authors Will begin to learn the
limitations of the print medium. "If the
medium Can‘t handle what you want to dowith
it,” Keeble Says, “you have to learn how to
change your work " Thus, the authors will
have a firsthand opportunity to see what
they can do With print, how they Can adapt
the medium to their Work and whenthey must
adapt their work to fit the medium.

At the end of the Course, each of the parti-
cipants will have the sheets they haveprinted
containing copies or his or her work. The
sheets Will be collected loosely in a box, to
be called an assemblage. Binding will he
avoided in order to maintain the “assem-
blage"chztr:tcter of the work, A few copies
will be put in the library, and the remainder
may bersold to the bookstore, uith profits
going to the General Literary Studies prOr
gram. ot VihiCh this project is a part.

Keehle sees writng as not an act oicrcating.
but rather letting what is inside the author
come out. --l tlon't compose when [ am writ-
mg. I just write down what is already there
inside me l don‘t know where the ideas come
from. The secret ot successtul writing is to
just let it become what it wants to become,"

Keehle sees a great need at Ul'inneli tor
more protessionals in the area oi the arts -
theatre, art, and music A triodneresidence
is good for music, hut he ieels thav Grin-
nell’s writers are neglected,

Releasing tension, expressing hiddcu feel-
ings, and developing voices, authors and poets
on the Grinneli campus are continu-ng to
express their teelings about themselves and,
the world around them. Although there are a
tew courses directly related to improving
writer's style and technical proticiency, it?“
Keeble press provides one practical expert
ence in translating abstract ideas into hot
type
