The Literary Supplement of a
recent sac served as a means ior
many Grinnell students to see poetry
that they have written in print ior
the first time. Irina Manurin, a
junior, did not need to take that op-
portunity; her book, Black Chicago,
has been in print ior the last year.
The book, a collection oishort poems
is published by Ranmck playwrights
Company, lnc., oi New York, a com—

pany which attempts to get wi‘iters‘

irom minority groups, blacks and
native Americans, in print

A natural interest in reading gave
irma her interest in poetry Her
poems are short, oiten terse, state
ments of black life in the Midwest,
from the city to the college. Irma
became interested in Grinnell when
her high school, Chicago's nearly
all black Lucy Flower women’s Irade
school, obtained its firstblackprin-
clpal. The principal’s son, Howard
Ward, attended Grinnell. The
Upward Bound program, summer
school at Yale, and a curriculum that
was slowly being changed irom a
simple trades outlook prepared irma
ior college.

irma met the owner and iounder

oi the new company at a Black
Writer's Conierence in Chicago, in
February oi 1911. She had been
writing ior as long as she could ree
member and had previously had
poetry about the death oi Martin
Luther King published She
describes the Conference as a
“group oi old people trying to do
something about things they have
written.”

She finds the staii at Grinnell, who
have interest in creative writing,
somewhat withdrawn, and wishes
that a program were started to help
students who write, “even it they

Applications
0n Increase

As of the end of January, 1972, the
Admissions Office has received ap
plications irom a total oi 903 prose
pective ireshmen, including all:
male applicants and 485 female ape
plicants. The total amount of fresh
men applicants ior this year shows
an increase oi 144 ireslimcn appli»
cants as to the total number (759) oi
prospective students tallied at the
end oi January, 1971. This 19% to
20% increase in the number of ap-
plications is heartily welcomed by
Mr. Nicholas Ryan and his Admis—
sions staii even though he expects
well over 1,000 applications by the
middle of February.

One item that has been a tilt bale
mug is the rise and tall in the num»
ber of female applicants. By the end
of January, 1971 there was a mayor»
ity of 397 male applicants as com-
pared to the 362 iemale applicants
This year the reverse is happening.
The Admissions Office can not
readily pinpoint the reasons ior the
rise in the number of female appllr
cants this year as compared to that
of last year. Although the reason tor
the 144 prospective freshmen in-
crease this year is not known, the
Admissions Office is nonetheless
delighted in the results It maybe
incidental lhal Mr. Ryan has just
returned from the Regional Board
Meeting in Chicago where he dis
covered that the increase lll ape
plicanls l0 Gl‘innell College is not
a trend among the other ACM col»
leges.

inst stick it in the drawer.” Toward
this end she would like to seepeople
get together to read poetry, perhaps
in the coffeehouse oithe Forum, “a
pertect place,” and thereby encour—
age iuiormhl Criticism.

Classes where writers would be
encouraged in the most modern
forms of literature she also sug-
gests, rather than courses based on
the traditional idea that stories
“must have a beginning, middle, and
end " ln an effort not to stifle Wrir
ters, irma suggests that such
courses he on a totally ungraded
basis. As to extracurricular writ»
ing projects, she doubts their ei—
iectiveness since both the students,
and the qualified writers on the stair,
have heavy class-loads,

irma was pleased by the sol; sup»
plement ior poetry and hopes that it
will remain a permanent part oi the
paper. Beyond that she’d like to see
Grinnell Create, and sustain, a lite-
rary magazine. She also suggests
that the Grinnell,Magazine accept
more student work, since it reaches
a larger audience, and perhaps an
interested alumnus who would help
a student Whose work he feels has
promise.

The philosophy of writing that irma
has adopted is slightlydiiierent than
the "organic” philosophy oi Mr.
Keeble, as expressed in the sets.
irma sees the artist as the “eyes
oi the people,” and attempts lohave
the poetry serve the iunction of in»
ioi-ming people oi things they know
but can’t express. poetry, she says,
can both be ”art for art’s sake” and
serve a propagandistic purpose.

lrnla plans to write professionally,
or perhaps to teach after she fin-
ishes school. The former alternative
may be hard; she has found, as must
write rs, that the wages are quite low.
Recently she received a check irom
the Times of India, where She has
recently been living. The payment
for a poem of hers they had published
was 25 ruppees, about threedollars.

Consider SAGA Changes

by David Crow

The subcommittee on Facilities
and Food Service of the Student Serr
vices Committee is considering sev-
eral possible changes in the Food
Service set-up.

One of these proposals, continental
breakfast, has already been adopted.
After a two-week trial period ending,
last week, it was approved as a
regular item. There has beenacom-
bined attendance (both Cowles and

Joint Boards Meeting
Two SGA Vice-Presidents?

A constitutional change lo abolish
AWS and C of HP Presidents and
replace them with two SGA Vice
Presidents and a resolution of sup
port for a change in the current
independent Study restrictions occu-
pied the attentions of the Joint
Board in their Wednesday meeting

Noting that separate boards ior men
and women “has become an anach»
ronisni”, the proposed constitur
tlonal amendment would abolish the
office of AWS President and C out?
president, and instead provide two
Vice Presidents of SGA. Byanﬂ—4—l
Vote, an addition was made to the
proposed change that one ofthe VP’s
must be male and one female. After
some discussion, the motion to sub-
mit the proposed change to a stu-
dent body referendum was passed
by an Bea vote, after some quick
telephoning by Kathi Ellis, in ord‘er
to reestablish a quorum.

A referendum on the proposal will
take place in the lunch lines on
Thursday. If the motions carry, it
will mean that all students will vote

for two SGA Vice Presidents. Also,
the idea of two separate Boards will
no longer exist . the organization
will henceiorth simply be the Joint
Board.

The Boards also considered the is-
sue of restrictions which are now
placed on independent Study. After a
good deal of discussion of the var-
ious departments’ concerns, the
Boards voted 7—3 to Support the re-
moval ofi the Current a credit
restriction in any one department.

The Boards then moved to further
consideration of the Student
Auditor's proposal to zero accounts.
After much discussion (which,
among other things, brought to light
the fact that $1900 out of the $2000
Culturalelnitiative Fund has already
been committed) the proposal to zero
accounts was defeated.

Registrar Charles Seller has
agreed to an informational meeting
with the Boards shortly aiter Spring
Break to discuss and clarify the op»
erations of his office and methods of
dealing with complaints.

THREE LEVELS OF SHOPS

Quad) averaging 75, and its cost,
while higher than expected, has not
been overwhelming,

The a la carte option (where each
item is bought separately) faces
difficulties. It would require a con—
siderable investment in cash regis-
ters and in new serving iacilities,
which, in order to be jusiiiied, would
require perhaps several hundred
students willing to take this option,
Few students, however, have so iar
voiced support ior the idea, cer-
tainly not to the committee mem—
hers, who must make the decision,

Most radical of the ideas being
discussed is the ”extende servmg
schedule.“ This envisions having
the dining halls open considerably
longer than they are now, though
with hour or hourrand~a»half breaks
between serving periods. This plan
is attractive for its convenience and
in that it would probably reduce
lines.

As with all things, though, it has its
disadvantages. it would be heavily
dependent on seli»bussing in dining
halls (especially Quad) not designed
for this. They could be altered, but
this would entail some expense and
reduce seating capacity, Sitedowns
would have to go, Students on par—
tial board would have to be limited
to certain times, to prevent them
from eating meals for which they did
not pay. And there is the basic prob-
lem oi preserving iood prepared
ahead of time such that its edibility
is not impaired.

New Tax Could
Allect College

by John Morrisssev

The lowa legislature is tinally
cracking down on the tax—exempt
status of religious institutions.

A bill currently before the Iowa
House places previously exempt sin»
gle-iamily homes on property tax
roles for the first time. This in-
cludes church-owned residences
such as rectories. But it also ap-
plies to single-iamily homes owned
by private colleges, such as Presi-
dent Leggell’s current residence.

The portions of the bill dealing with
one»family homes are designed to
make property taxes consistent and
fair to iowa homeowners, by sub»
jecting all such dwellings to taxa-
tion. regardless of their ownership.
Churches themselves, as well as
college dorms and buildings, would
not be affected by the bill.

Wednesday, the language in the hill
relating to parsonages was tempered
by an amendment making the first
$20,000 ufa reclory's actual propel”
ty value exempt irom taxation. The
amendment, submitted by Rep, Al-
fred Nielsen (Dem.Defiance), was
aimed primarily at keeping small
Church institutuions in operation.
Nielsen’s amendment was adopted
by a 66-26 margin.

No similar proposals have been
tiled, however, to establish partial
exemptions ior college-owned fam-
ily homes. This would mean that
someone, either the occupants or
the College itself, would have to
come up with an annual propertytax
payment on residences owned by our
academic institution. The College,
in addition to the President’s House,
owns a number oi iaculty-occnpied
homes within a three-block radius
of the campus.

The entire bill deals with much
more than the tax status of single»
family dwellings. Filed by the House
Ways and Means Committee, it is
designed to revise and refurm-iowa’s
outdated and porous property.tax.
code. Tax-exempt establishments
under consideration by the bill in»
clude cemeteries, municipal audi—
toriums, and fraternal organiza~
(ions.

The House was still considering
amendments to the bill at press
time. If it does pass the House,
it still iaces Senate approval.
