The Nixon Vacuum:

Four More Years?

Democracy is an unusual political animal. It toleratesdissent,
and sometimes is taken over by the dissenters. It espouses
the majority View, yet sometimes acts to protect a specific
minority. It is ruled by the few, yet is responsible, in large
part, to the many. Such a political system provides a singular
opportunity for the manwho canleadacountry, who can capture
its mood and its passwn, take over a social movement, and
shape it in his ownphilosophyto lend it credibility and success.

The Presidential election of I972, the editors believe, is one
in which such concepts should be uppermost in the minds
of the voters, for the primary issue in this election must be
the performance of Richard Nixon in the White House, and
that performance has been a comspicuous failure in terms of
the leadership model outlined above.

President Nixon is a man who buys time. Aiming primarily
to keep himself in office, he seems not to be able to grapple
with the fundamental issues of American society but rather
aligns himself with the likes and dislikes of segments of the
population, thus retaining a measure of popularity with the
people and also a measure of stagnation for the country.

People may honestly differ in their beliefs about things as
simple as right and wrong, as both Presidents Johnson and
Nixon have discovered. Vietnam may appear very moral and
righteous to the person who believes, genuinely, in the threat
of Communism and the thesis that it grows on the world like
a cancerous disease, while the same situation appears as
the height of moral flagrancy to others, who see civilians
suffering and a society up rooted by the terror of war. This
bind, however, does not justify an abdication of the search
for a solution.

President Nixon can be said in some sense to be appealing
to a true national mood: his stands on bussing, defense
spending, his Vietnam policy, and his non-action in the area
of Civil Rights have the support, surely, of many Americans.
The consensus, however, is not an overriding one, for he is
merely appealing to prejudices and the ignorance of the people
rather than recognizing realities of change. “He is a juggler
of creeds, a man of principle who is constantly shifting his
principles,” wrote Joseph Kraft in a copyrighted column in
the Des Moines Register last week. “His forte is keeping
the game going, avoiding the worst confrontations.”

The American people are entitled to more than this. In the
present day the country must demand a man who faces the
society's fundamental problems and tries, in honest and prag-
matic fashion, to solve them within our democratic context.
Senator George Mchern has long represented such a philo»
sophy, such a humanitarian viewpoint, which is necessary in a
time of conﬂict and division within the country. He appeals,
genuinely, to a heritage of American idealism which values
courage, torthrightness, and concern. Anddespitehis campaign
blunders he has been shown to have the willingness to face a
problem, and to move to solve it.

Perhaps the editors of the New York Times said it best
on September 28, when, in an editorial endorsing Senator
McGovern, they said ”We believe he can restore a sense
of purpose to the American people as a whole,asense of
participation to their component parts and a sense of integrity
to their government.”

Unless we restore that sense of higher purpose and that
sense of integrity, we lose valuable time in a world where the
problems are overbearing already. Four more years ofRichard
Nixon would be, we fear, four more years of time lost.

Snow: A Personal Involvement

by Jim All

Some oi you niny have seen me
out on centlal campus last ’ruesr
day night, shaking my list at the
sky and cursing my personal gods
for the snow that was coming down.
I feel that I owe you an explana-
tion.

You see, I take snow as a per-
sonal insult.

This may seem strange to peer
ple who know that I have lived in
Iowa [or twentyrone years now,
They may ask, “But don’t you get
used to lt'7”

No. A lifetime of shoveling snow,
getting car's stuck in snowdritts,
trudging through snow, and look
ing at big dirty lnuunds ct mushy
snow [or three or four months out
of the year has, ilnnything, intenr
sihed my feelings
Telling me to go play out in the
snow is like telling anyone else
to go play out on Highway 6.

SAGA Workers:
Complaint

To the Editors‘

The purpose of this letter is to
attempt an explanation of student
employment practices by SAGA
SAGA managers are currently at
tempting to cut costs by stretching
student labor. For example, three
students may be assigned itjob which
takes them one hour. SAGA must
therefore allow for three hours of
pay to accomplish that job. However,
if one student is not able to work,
two may be required to do the work
of three. It should he understood
that these two students may finish
their job In the some one hour,
but they must obviously work harder
to do so. Yet, SAGA pays only lor
two hours of student labor despite
the [act that the job normally re
quires three hours. Two students
work harder to do the work or three,
but do not receive the pay of three
workers.

SAGA stretches the work of the
student and benefits from 3 tier
crease in the cost of wages. Thus
Students work harder, not for their
own good, but for the benefit of
SAGA. We consider this unfair, We
believe that the total time allowed
for the job (in this case, three
hours) should be divided between
the two Students who actually work,
However, the Student workers seem
to have little Say In the matter. In
any case, We believe that Students
should be aware of these unfair
employment practices here on
campus in the hope that something
can be done about them

and fresh and spnl‘kllngﬁdon'l you
think that is pretty”

Well, sure. But come back and
ask me that in three months.

1 should also apologize to the peo-
ple who were walking around and
saying things like, “Wow! Isn't snow
just FAR OUT!" Iain afraid 1 may
have been a little rude. My mother
would be ashamed, although she
would share my sentiments,

It is justthal l haveallunrensonable
resentment or you carpetbaggcrs
who come 'to Iowa and enjoy the
snow, but who have never Shoveled
a walk or tried to drive in the show
You have never iormed tllepersonal
involvement with snow that Comes
with experience

When you leave at Christmas, many
of you worry that it might rain at
home 1 worry that our house is
going to disappear under an ava»
lanche, I hate people who comeback
from Christmas break with Sun»
tans.

Every day of Christmas break,
I will hassle snow in some way.
After a snow, the driveway must be
shoveled before anyone can leave.
it must be shoveled again after the
snowplow comes by and shoves all
the snow back into the driveway
For that reason, you develop mixed
emotions about snowplows

After you have shoveled the drive-
way, and shoveled it again, you can
jump in the car and take off if
it will start. 11 not, you learn all
about supply, demand, and price
levels from your friendly neignr
borhood servrce station. Bribes are
recommended if you are in a hurry.
Actually, driving anywhere in a

 

llul'l‘y dttring an Iowa winter is not
encouraged At an incppcrtunc moms
em, you are likely to iind that turn-
ing the steering wheel produced no
change in direction. and stomping
the brakes produces no deceleration.

If you are lucky, you will hit a
snowdrlrt and recover your car in
the spring thaw If you are like me,
you will hit something more subs
stanlial,

“But don't you enjoy winter
sports?" What winter Sports? Have
you ever seen an Iowa ski hill?
Have you ever l‘ztlnlned a four-man
lohoggan into a tree7 Have you ever
flipped a snowmobile”

Do you wonder, then, why the major
winter sport in Iowa is swearing?
You can understand why glrls' bas—
ketbnll is so big in Iowa; what else
is there in January:7

Well, there is the cold. Cold is
something unpleasant that comes
with snow Cold is what makes snow
squeak when you walk on it, rather
than decently crunching. Cold is
whirl kills cars and leaves you walk
ing through the snow,

if you had not guessed, I feel the
same way about cold as about snow,
only more so,

So in January, when winter is hap-
pening in earnest, you may see me
walking along the railroad tracks
and looking at the snow and thehare
trees, I will not he enjoying the
beauty of Iowa winter, but renewing
a relationship with a lifelong antag—
Onlst.

But who knows? With luck, I might
be enduring my last Iowa winter....
in which case, you might even catch
me smiling.

Butterfly Buffet

(Ed. note:

Butterﬂy Buffet, a children’s production written and directed

by Assistant Professor of Theater Bruce Halverson, is being presented this

weekend in the Arena Theater. Remaining performances will be at 4:15 p.m.
today, 10:30 am. and 7:30 p.m. Saturday, and 4:15 p.m. on Sunday. The fol»
lowing reviews were writteniyesterday by members or Mr. Moffett’s freshman
tutorial in Ltteater criticism.) '

by Allison Price

Butterﬂy Buffet is an unusual,
engrossing play for children. The
story is simple—--tllat of a bumbr
ling pirate and his mate, in search
of a butterﬂy with golden wings.
What makes this play unique, though,
is its atmosphere of dance and
rhythm, Abstract characters with
painted faces are a body of waves
one moment, then crawling into
every corner as Jungle animals,
then together again as a mum,
person caterpillar or spider. Such
agility is essential to the produce
tlonﬁpatterns move in the charac-
ters' faces and costumes and ac-
tions, against a background ofchantr
ing and drumming music and light.
To say what a child's reaction to
Butterﬂy Buffet would be Is dlf—
licult. The energy and clamoul‘ of
the production are enough to hold
interest, but is probably in the
antics of the captain and his one
man crew that traditional “story-
time” enterminment is found,
Butterﬂy Buffet is a creation or
happy dancing and fantasy. Rather
than remembering a structure built
of scenes andcharncters,one comes
away with a unitied impression of
rhythm and light and color, like it
kinetic picture,

by Alice Bernstein
To see Butterﬂy Buffet is to enter
a fantastic world of singing flows
as, screaming spiders, and silly
sailors. Bruce Halvel'soil llaswrltl

children to enjoy. it is the story
of a greedy pirate (David Gaines)

and his not-very-brlght crewmate,

Norvel (0. Barry Huﬂ) and their
adventures in their search for a
butterﬂy with golden wings. In
alliance with a nasty spider, they
capture the butterfly (John Benecki)
only to ﬁnd that the gold turns to
dust once it is removed train the
butterfly’s wings.

Basic lessons at good and evil are
inherent, however it is not the in-
tention of the director to teach ins
sipid morals, Rather, we are in»
vlted to participate in an exciting
theatre experience, Performed in
the small Arena Theatre with a
sizeable cast in colorful costumes,
the audience could not help but feel
that they were right in the middle
of the jungle Indeed, one child
joined in the animal chorus towards
the end of the play.

There was a great deal of beauti-
fully timed and perlormed action.
Animals stretched, scratched and
crawled ln wonderfully individual
ways. The spider and the caters
pillar were each composed oi seve—
ral actors who moved together in
rhythmic unity, There was a short
(lance segment choreographed by
Deborah Jafte indicating the change
of seasons in the jungle as the
caterpillar turns into a butterlly.
This and thc lew songs worled very
well. They were short, simple and
integrated very naturally into the
action.

Outstanding in the performance
were thld Gaines and Barry Huff
in the lead roles and narri Etta
