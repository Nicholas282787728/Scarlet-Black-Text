Communications Office Communicates

by Ann Cassel

Successful communication Seems
to be one of the biggest problems in
today‘s society. Successful com-
munication promotes better under-
standing and this is the purpose of
the office of College Relations. _

William Deminoff, DirectorofCol-
lege Relations, cites the prevention
oi misunderstandings about the colr.
lege among townspeople and those in
surrounding areas as one ofthe main
jobs of the office, Deminofl and

Dr. Sidney A. Rand, president of
St. Olaf College has left on the first
leg of a foreign tour the Hands are
taking during a leave grant Rand has
received from the Danforth Foun—
dation. The grant, similar to the
one received by Grinnell’s Glenn
Leggett this year, allows selected
college presidents to get away from
their campuses and gain "some
fresh perspectives."

Community organizer Saul Alinsky
spoke at St. Olaf and also at Carle-
ton College on January 19 and 20.

CUE COLLEGE
Senator Edmund Muskie appeared
t Coe College's Sinclair Auditorium
on Tuesday, January 18. During the
question and answer period, he clare
ified his stand on granting amnesty
0 war exiles. Muskie stated that
“repatriation of those young pens
ple" who fled the country to escape
the draft “must be a national ob
jective when the fighting and dying
has ended".
lowa Senator Harold Hughes, who
~arlier in the day had announced his
support tor the Muskie candidacy,
was characterized by the Maine
Senator as “an impressive man, an
mpressive Governor, and an im-
pressive United States Senator...
when a man like Harold Hughes
ays he's for me, he prods me
into being something better than
myself.”

The Coe College Senate is facing
an unusual problem in this age of
deficit spending -- it has a budget
urplus it can’t iigure out how to
spend. Student Body President Gary
Roberts feels that the money should
not be “thrown away” but also feels
hat it is unethical to retain too
large a surplus,
He pointed out that graduating senr
iors would be cheated out of their
share of the activity funds if the
money was not utilized until next
year.
CARTHAGE COLLEGE
The Carthage College StudentGov-
ernment Association declared

Schmidhuuse

by Don Homolka

John Schmidhauser, a professor of
political science at the University of
iowa and a candidate for the DemOr
cratic nomination to run for Cone
gress from lowa's first Congrese
sional district, spoke last Friday in
the South Lounge under the auspices
of the Program in Practical Politi-
cal Education. Schmidhauser was a
oneeterm Congressman (1966-67)
and is vying with Ed Mezvinsky, who
was in Grinnell last fall, for the nomr
nation.

A sparse collection of students and
interested townspeople heard the
candidate praise his role as an early
critic of the Vietnam policy and a
longtime champion of liberal res
forms. Near the close of his lecture
he dealt also with the environmental
issue as well.

stressing the fact that he comes
from a labor background, Schmidr
hauser generally attempted to idenr
tify himself with the little man and
the common people. His speaking
style was as drab as the overcast
Friday sky, and perhaps due to the
early stage of his campaign there
was a noted lack of specificity on
issues dealing with the future.

Schmidhauser was more impres»
sive as he dealt with specific ques-
tions posed by the audience. His
stand on issues is ofia very liberal
nature, except where they conflict
with his rather populist stand. 0n
the amnesty issue, for example, he
refused to commit himself since he
thinks amnesty now unfair to those
who have served in the military.

Schmidhauser noted that he was the
first Democrat elected to the House
from his district since the Depres-
sion. Although the statement was
true, one could also note that his
election came in the year of the
Johnson landslide, and Schmidhau-
ser lost again just two years later.
He seems to be a true system poli-
tician of good liberal stock, working
hard for reiorm in government and

office. In order to prevent the flow

oi unnecessary paper in orinneil
College mailboxes, the Campus
Mom has been introduced. The
need for an effective internal com-
munications organ is also recog»
nized by the oliice.

Writing brochures, ﬂiers, and
booklets, such as the new “Sharing
of Grinnell", used to present Grin-
nell to perspective students is an»

' other of the many duties of College
Relations. Ruth Prescott, Associate
Director of College Relations, is
in charge cl this facet.

The Grinneil Magazine, edited by
Gordon Brown, has a wide circulae
tion among alumni, students, par~

,ents and other interested people.

Deminoff stressed the importance
of technical excellence in all that
the otiicc produces. Recognition ot
Grinnell as the best small college
in the area of college relations by
the Association of American College
Public relations proves that they

1 have achieved it.

‘doubt if a student would take one of

; NIXON from pugel

, something to kind of overshadow
that. Here again he's making a short»
term political decision that's going
to pull the rug right out from under
the opposition. This is really going to

, hurt McGovern especially,"
i Mike also predicted a serious mili-
tary action by the North Vietnamese:
‘ “If I were in the North Vietnamese
. camp what lwould do right now would
be to have an incredible offensive
. and destroy any idea that Vietna»
niization will work. That would put
Nixon against a wall; either «holes
V have to get out, or he’ll have to get
, hack in some way, That could throw
: the election to the peace candidate.”

Junior Dave Rosenwasser was sus-
picious of Nixon, “there’s some—
thing missing, something he isn't
telling us. Nixon usually doesn’tlie,
he’s just very selective about the
truth.”

. Sophomore Karen Auerbach said
. “i think its typical of his shrewd
politics; he's going to end the war
just before the election."

“I just think its marvelously in»
dicative of the way Nixon does
things: at his own pace, at his own

‘ time, and by surprise," said senior
i Shelley Floyd.

Senior Chris Madsen felt that it
“was a pretty reasonable series or
proposals. The only thing i could see
that was any problem with it was that
he did not make any specific mention
of the airwar....l was kind of sur»
prised; I was particularly impressed

‘with his proposal tor reconstruction
after the settlement is made in North
and South Vietnam."

Junior Clayton Lee commented,
"It was a good move, but it was ex—
pedient for his party. Why didn’t he
do it before?”

Strabtsmic Paintings On Display

Eighteen sirahismicpaintings by Wendell Brazeau are now on display at the
Scheaffer Gallery. The exhibition, which continues through Feb. IO, was
first shown at the Henry Gallery at the University ct Washington at Seattle
in 1970 and is now being circulated by the Western Association of Art Museum
of Seattle.

Brazeau, a professor of art at the University'of Washington since 1963,
earned am. and M.F.A degrees there. Hehas also, studiedat th,e,Calitcrv—.
nia school of Fine Arts and at the Archipenko Art School in Woodstock, N.‘x'.-~
He has exhibited widely throughout the United States, with numerous cne»m an
shows, and has also received many awards and honors.

Brazeau says of his exhibition‘ “These paintings are based on two well—
known optical illusions. As 'f'ar as I know, these effects have never been
exhibited before as an art form. Although they may be viewed in a normal
way, their spatialeffect is enhanced by viewing them in a ‘stereoscopic‘
way —- that is, with the eyes Slightly crossed so that similar forms overlap.
This is, in eitect, like viewing the paintings as if they were closer than they
actually are.
