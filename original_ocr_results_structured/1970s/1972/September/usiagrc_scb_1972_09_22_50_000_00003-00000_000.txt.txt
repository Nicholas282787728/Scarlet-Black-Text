Off-Campus Program Analysis.
New Guidelines Next Spring

by Don Dagenais

A college committee of Students,
laculty and administrators is cur-
rently examining the multitude of
oiircampus study programs now
available to Grinnell students and
hopes to lormulate a Seriesoiregib
lations and guidelines governing
participation oIGrinnell students in
the program, DeanoiAdministration
Waldo S. Walker told the 5&5 Tues—
day. The committee, headed by
Pruiessor oiEconomics John Dawn
son, is scheduled to report to Walk-
er on Octoberls recommending col—
lege pohcy positions and regulations
Walker‘s cities will then complete
the task oi formulating the final
guidelines and regulations, a
process which should be completed
by next Spring.

The committee consists olDaWson,
(acuity members Victor Verrette.
Dennis Perri, Ralph Luebben, Ch»
arles Duke, Registrar Charles Sel~
ler, and students Kit Gage, Keith
Kozloll and Sue Grodsky.

Because oi a proliferation 0! one
campus programs in recent years
and because of the confused state
or academic aiiairs regarding the
evaluation of educational experi—
ences away from Grinnell, Walker

told the 55:8, the college is in
position of having to re-evaluate its

“philosophy" regarding the pros
grams.

An immediate problem racing the
college, according to Walker, is
“what the college will do about tie
nancial aid," presently only stu—
dents participating in oiiicial ACM
programs, the Washington Semester
oi American University, andthe Le-
Moyne-Owon program receive ii-
nancial aid while away irom campus,

"This," according in Walker, “is
nniair because oi the numbers oi
people on campus ior whom thereis
no appropriate ollrcnmpus pro-
gram.” Language students, in par-
ticular, may teel that a semester
in a ioreign land is essential ior
their education, yet the ACM otters
no programs in many ioreign coun»
tries “We have to reconsider
what our iinancial aid priorities
are,"

Further complications arise in the
area or how the college treats acar
demic credit earned away trom Gr-
inch, “The Committee on Aca-
demic Standing is faced with a tree
inendous problem," Walker says.
“There is a great ditterence in the
quality or various programs -- we
have to asses what that quality is ”
Some programs such as the Ar-
gonne semester and the Washington
Semester are tairly stable irom
year to year and so the evaluation
process will be, at least tor the
time being a onesshpt process with
other programs, however, the coir
lege may have to estalish an on»
campus agency to deal with the
evaluation problem

The college must also decide who
ther or not Gl'llltlell should Silhs
sci-inc to all the ACM programs
"Smile programs." Walker obs
serves. may not in our needs very
well "
presently it does so. although other

schools in the Conference do not.

A more dillicult question concerns
the types or programs ior which
Grinnell will give credit. Recently
several programs in “experimental
living” have been created, parti~
cular in ioreign countries, which
carry with them no iormal class—
room work. ”How Iormal must the
program be in ordgr for us to
grant oilscampus credit?” Walker
[eels that some Sort of guidelines
must soon be established,

Grinnell may also consider the
possibility oi establishing its own
programs abroad. Some proposals
ior Grinnellrspunsured programs
have been made, but the college is
still in the process at investigating
them.

Finally, the college must choose
whether or not it will limitthenumé’
hers at students and the types oi
students which can participate in
Study elsewhere. Some institutions
limit the number otstudents who can
be away irom campus duringagiven
semester, others do not allow
students in “marginal” academic
standing to leave the campus,
Furthermore, the college must
consider whether Or not it will deA
fine the semesters during which a
student may be gone Grinnell pre~
sently has a sevenrsemester resi»
deuce requirement and a regulation
that second semester seniors must
be on campus, but, says Walker,
“the college has been free and
liberal about those."

Once these questions are resolved,
the college must adopt a series oi
iirm policy statements regarding
the matters Approval by the Com-
mitlee on Academic Standing and
the faculty will be necessary, but
Walker hopes that the guidelines can
be established by "next March or
so" in order that students leaving
the campus during the l973-74 sch-
ool year willheahleto operateunder
the new policy
