The Iconoclast

Part 0“ Values: Their Origin 8. Nature

by Gregg Datiner

The purpose oiethicsisto discover
and define a code of values to guide
man’s choices and actions and it
is by these choices and actions that
the purpose and course ofman’slife
is determined.

One might suppose (and most do!)
that the first question of ethics is
”what code of value Should man
accept?” In fact, most philosophers
have taken the existence of ethics
tor granted—-as a sort or given,
historical tact. Consequently, few
concerned themselves with diSr
covering its metaphysical (i.e., that
which pertains to realitynthe nae
ture of things, to existence) or obs
iective validation.

The question is: Is the concept of
value (of good and evil) anarhitrary
human invention or convention, a
custom underived, unsupported by
the facts of reality, or is it based
on a metaphysical fact, on an un—
alterable fact of reality which deg
mands it? IS ethics founded on
whims, personal emotions, edictsof
God or society, or is it based on
reason? Is ethics a subjective lux»
ury--or an objective necessity?

“Value is that which one acts to
gain and/or keep”. But as such
the concept of value is not a pri-
maryﬁit presupposes an answer to
the question “of value to whom and
for what7”, and an entity capable
of acting to achieve a goal where
there is an alternative.

In the universe, the existence of
inanimate matter is unconditional.
The basic alternative ofexistence or
nonexistence pertains only to a
single class of entities--living Drv
ganisms (because the existence of
life is conditional). Life depends on
a specific course of action--with the
only alternative being--death, “Life
is a process of self-sustaining and
self-generation action”. If and when
an orgainism fails in that action it

tence.

Only living entities can have goals

the world, surpassing Hollywood and
second only to Tokyo, there is a
popular movie star, said to be a
sort or combination or Errol Flynn
and James Bond, who is seen as
the incarnation of a particular par
litical party, the DMK. This actor
apparently typiiies a cinema so
highly politicized that one panelist
claimed he could tell the po-
litical preterence at an lndian in
Tamalnadu from hi favorite movie
star, with 35% accuracy. What ex—
actly he was going to do with piece
of political legerdemain the analyst
did not indicate, except to say that
with more information he could be
even more accurate. Which would
seem likely. if he was much of an
analyst.

Cinema does not require literacy,
so it would seem an ideal propa
aganda medium tor India. But ans
thorities on Indian film who were
present said the cinema audience
there was primarily an educated and
literate one, and that the impres-
sions it gleaned from films seemed

or can originate them. Hence, it is
the concept of life that makes the
concept of “value" possible. Only
living organisms have the capacity
for self—generated and goal-directed
action.

An organism's life depends on two
factors: the material (fuel) which
it needs from the outside (physical
environment) and the action of its
own body in using that tuel properly
That is on the phySical level--all
functions of all living entities are
actions generated by the organism
itself and directed to that single goal
"the maintenance of its life (goal
-directed in reference to the auto-
matic functions of an organism
means that those actions are such
that their nature results in the pre
servation ot the organism’s lite).
The standard, therefore, which deg
termines what isproper in this Con-
text is the organism‘s life- that
which is required forthe organism’s
survival,

In this issue. no choice is open
to an organism, That is, the kind
of entity it is, determines by its
nature that which is required for its
survival. Whereas there are many
variations (forms) of adaptation to
its environment which are possible
to an organism (such as existing tor
a while in a diseased or disabled
condition)—-the basic alternative
at its existence remains the same.

it an organism fails _in the basic
iunctilm required by its nature--

it dies. Basically, it is in this sense
that stagnation is the antithesis of
life.

“An ultimate Value is that final
goal or end to which all lesser
goals are the meanshand it sets
the standard by which all lesser
goals are evaluated”. Since life can
only be kept in existence by a cone

stant process of self-sustaining ace
tion--the goal of that action (the
ultimate value which, in order to
be kept, must be gained at every
moment) is its life. Therefore, an
organism's life is its standard of

rather to reinforce than to,dis-
place or reshape those picked up
from other media.

Toward noon the panel seemed
on the brink of deciding it had got
the wrong topic and had better come
back another day to deal with film
and its eltects on what one pane
elist called the “manipulative~ex~
cuse me, the policy—making” elite.

All of which in the end leads to
a sneaking suspicion that movies,
like any other voluntary activity, are
of dubious value in )nculcating new
ideas.

As one panelist said, those who like
John Wayne probably don’t think too
highly of Jane Fonda, and viceversa.
This could be taken another step:
most Americans probably like to go
see “Patton,” not “The Battle of
Algiers," and most Chinese no doubt
prefer “The East is Red” to “Tales
of the Geen Berets.”

But exactly what does that tell us
that we didn't already know, in
terms of conclusions? Not much,
certainly nothing worthing hitching
down to the Hilton for Let alone
coming all the way trom New York,
L. A. and Tamalhadu.

value: ”that which furthers its
life is the good; that which threatens
it is the evil.“

Since a series of means going off
into an intinite progression to which
there is no existing end is both a
metaphysical and epistemological
impossibilityrrthere must be an
ultimate goal or end, without whch
there could be no lesser goals or
means. Only by the existence of an
ultimate goal (an end in itself) is
the existence of values possible.
On a metaphysical levelrrlife is
the only phenomenon that is an end
in ltself--a value gained and kept
by a continuous process or action.
On an epistemological level—-the
concept of “value” is based upon
(and theretore genetically dependent
on) and derived from the antecedent
concept of "life". It is impossible
to speak of "value” apart from
“life” because it is only the cons
cept or “life” that makes the Con-
cept of “value” possible.

On a metaphysical level-~liie is
the only phenomenon that is an

end in itselt—-a value gained and
kept by a continuous process of ac-

tion. on an epistemological level-—
the concept of “value“ is basedupon
(and therefore genetically dependent
on) and derived from the antecedent
concept of ”life”. it is impossible
to speak of ”value" apart from
“life” because it is only the con-
cept of “life" that makes the con-
cept of “value" possible.
Lastly--to antiClpate those who
claim that there is no relation that
can be established between ultimate
values or ends and the facts of
reality-~the facts that a living en-
tity exists and functions necessitates
the existence of values and further
of an ultimate Value which is that
entity's own life. it is by refer
ence to the facts of reality that
value judgements achieved their val-
idation. “The fact that a living ens
tity is, determines what it ought
to do (and this is the relation be
tween ”isi’ and "ought”).

Next week I shall continue this
discussion by beginning with the
manner by which a human discovers
the concept of "Value".

inmates in the Danbury, Connecticut federal prison in what they described
as a “fast for life”.

that he feels his fast will have some effect on the current policies of
the Nixon administration. He describes the Nixon record currently being

dent as a “record of deception.”

physically very otten. Yet spiritually I remain strong, convinced that such
an action is. . ,consistent with the life I have led the past four years, . .”.
