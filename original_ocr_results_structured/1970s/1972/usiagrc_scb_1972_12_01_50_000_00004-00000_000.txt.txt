Back On The Path

We applaud the faculty action of last week in restoring open
committee meetings to the procedural rules of the faculty.
Although the issue itself was not of paramount importance,
the policy direction it implied would have led to an amount
of distrust and alienation between the faculty and students
which would have driven a wedge between the strong community
relationship which has been one of the principle features of
Grinnell life and Grinnell education.

We do not argue the point that the college hasa bureau—
cratic structure and that the faculty as an administrative body
has the power to make decisions without including students
in the process. Indeed the very nature of the student-teacher
relationship implies a clear dichotomy of roles and respon-
sibilities. Open faculty committee meetings, however, do not
violate that dictum nor do they limit faculty consideration of
sensitive issues so long as the committees’ privilege to turn
to executive session is preserved.

Above all, the community sense of Grinnell carries with it
a mutual spirit of consideration and respectbetween the groups
in the decision~making hierarchy. Particularly in academic
matters students are the group perhaps most interested in
the process for they are the individuals most affected by it.
The faculty has in recent years made wise policy decisions
in this regard, aimed at taking maximum benefit from the
opportunity of consulting the truly interested students at

the college.

Liberal Grinnell, we believe, should be able to preserve
that sense of consideration and respect without letting bur-
eaucratic dictums interfereThe direction of policy for the
past several years has verified that belief, and the faculty’s

decision last week reaffirmed it.

Martin: More Than Pressure

To the Editors

I wish to call attention to a Sub»
ject of covert nature which mayhave
serious implications for Grinnell
College in‘ the near future. lam
referring to a certain atmosphere
of dissatisfaction held by a number
of students with regard to Gi‘innell
College its an institution of learns
ing, a place for acquiring ”seffr
awareness”, or for shaping the in
dividual’s character.

This feeling is hard to pinpoint
and even harder to expalln. EX,
amples manifest themselves in such
diverse forms and degrees varying
from complaints about academic
pressure to a disorientation ofonc’s
surroundings to existential depres~
sion. lnotice these displays of dis
content fall into two main categor-
ies: a questioning of the value of
an education at Grinnell, and com-
plaints of stress due to a confined
academic and behavioral environ»
ment.

I have participated in and over»
heard numerous conversations deale
ing with the “academic bullshit”,
as it is termed, presented at the
college. Facetlous remarks about
the “Grinnell Experience" reveal
a cynical attitude toward some as
pects of college life and a reeval-
uatlon of the objectives of the col-
lege. To many, the goals of intellecs
tuality attempted by the college turn
out to be little more than an exs
ercise in written composition and
reading comprehension, along witha
development of articulation above
the level of obVious mediocrity. Stu—
dents find themselves questioning
the relevancy of what they learii with
the way they live after college The
myth of the “real world" vs, Grin»
nell is highly played up, due to a
disorientation of one’s academic eXs
periences (usually theoretical and
idealistic in nature) to one’s per-
sonal life outside Grinnell College.
The limitations of a Grinnell educa-
tion are further illustiated by cases
of students out of college who find
themselves unable to pursue a sat
isfaciory career without first oh-
taining a teacher’s certificate or a
Master’s degree The advantages of
Grinnell’s “finding one’s individual-
ity" and developing personal qual-
ities are lost in one's ignorance of
basic practical facts,

The matter of stress on campus is
more widely evidenced, Cases of
temporary insomnia, ulcers, and

lack of exercise exist throughout
campus. At the end of the semester,

at nuerosis called “being burnt out"
is registered in the behavior of many
students. The use of drugs and alcor
hol, particularly on weekends, is
justified as an escape ordistraction
from academic rigors; concertsare
a safety valve, carefully scheduled
to alleviate tension at the most hec-
tic times of the semester, ACM pro-
grams abroad are more highly emr
ployed by upperclassmen as a

E-
“chance to get away“ rather than an
opportunity to increase one's educa-
tional experiences,

Upperclassmen are not unique in
the desire to get out of the hassles
of the college. Freshman residents
of only half a semester expresstheir
feelings of tension as a motivation
for dropping out. Sophomores also
feel the pinch, and transfers after
the second year are not uncommon.

Granted, this pressure is not in its
self necessarily harmful, and prob-
ably supplies the greatest incentive
for reading and learning. But when
the methods of teaching are such that
they cause psychological distress
among more than Just a few individ-
uals, a critical fault exists some—
where in the philosophy ofeducation.

There are, of course, those who
greatly enjoy Grinnell College and
may object to this argument. I find
many who do are compelled by a
“work ethic" and desire to achieve
intellectual perfection, For them,
their idientity has already been
found; it is wellrdeflned, highly mo—
tivated and Satisfied by whatand how
much they learn at Gi‘innell, Other
people feel tilat if they don‘t subject
themselves to intensive studying,
tlley are not “getting their money's
Worth".

I acknowledge the ambiguity dial]
the examples and of the argument in
general I can't lielphut feel, how
ever, that the duscussion 0fthe issue
raises questions and doubts integral
to the function and direction ofGl‘llt-
nell College. The points mentioned
indicate to me that these problems
are not tlypochondriacal instances
of student overpowered by the
amount of work near the end of the
semester hut chronic symptoms of
institutional Structure.

Voertman‘. Faculty's IndependentConcerns

To the Editors:

The faculty discussion of the cens
tral issues involved in the sorcalled
”open committee" rule was thin,
and largely not in focus, in my
view. I assume it was clear thatl
dissent vigorously lrom the action
of Tuesday, November 21.

The function of the faculty IS educa-
tional policyﬁthe design and opera-
tion of the educational program-eand
adjunct to the management offaculty
personnel policy. Now these mate
ters are faculty business because we
are faculty members, not because we
are “members of the Grinnell Col-
lege Community", or any other such
loose citizen—like principle Faculty
members are now, and ought con-
tinue to be, selected on the basis
of very Special criteria of skill,
training, and experience. Moreover,
it is indeed this professional selec-
tivity of this segment of the college
communitynnot the physical plant
staff, or the development office staff,
or the Student body-which vests it
with major powers and responsibil-
ities to operate educational policy
and faculty personnel policy.

Mr. Grey and Mr. Kagan spoke on
Tuesday as though they did not uns
derstand my statements about Grin-
nell being “essentially a bureau-
cratic creature” rather than a par-
ticipatory democracy predicated on
the principles of equal rights “citi—
sens." My use ofthe adjective “burr
eaucratic" to characterize Grinnell
was intended to identify a college as
that form of social organization de-
scribed by Max Weber and, Iihought
understood as such, especially by
sociologists and political scientists.
The overriding characteristic of
such an orgainization is that Crir
tical functions, and thus critical de-
cislon-making apparatus, are vested
in professional (expert) office not»
ders. Thus, basic legitimacy of fac-
ulty office holders, and offaculty de—
cision-making, arises from their
professional (scholarly) credenr
tials as chemists, economists, his-
torians, etc., and as teachersMore—
over, legitimacy for these pro—
fessionals, as such, to make pol»
icy in areas of their competence
is defensible on the grounds that

there are substantive kinds of
training and experience which are
the basis of professional status.
I had hoped the duscussion would
focus precisely here that is, wne,
ther the involvement of students in
the faculty’s “bureaucratic” orproe
fessional, decision»making process
is a result of invitation of the lac—
ulty, or whether it is a matter of
the “rightsH of students.

Why the fuss? Hasn’t the faculty,
after all, seen fit to invite students
to participate selectively With them
in the appropriate facets of their
system of decision-making? Andhas
this not been useful and productive?
My acute dissent from this latest
action by the faculty preclselyarises
because the matter has been formed
as an issue of student's “rights."
The issue was posed by the confrons
tation between CBS and the adminis
tration last year and it has been his
terpreted by the President and the
Deans as such a matter; i.e., that
students had been granted certain
“rights" to involvement in the la-
culty’s decisionrmaklng processes.
Further, the positions takenby some
students in the discussion oi the op
oration of faculty committees has
been that students’ rights are me
volved and that the recommendation
of the Faculty Organization Commit—
tee on Committee Policy impaired
these rights.

It is not at all clear to me that
the faculty's performance of its role
in educationalpolicy and faculty per-
sonnel policy has been substantially
improved by our present mode of
involvement of students. My belief
that student inputs can be very bene—
ficial depends upon the quality ofthe
communication' on matters Where
students are especially informed and
sensitive. I continue to expect that
involvement of students in these
matters can be useful. I think it
especially important that the black
student minority on the campus be
provided with unobstructed oppor
tunities to make known their ins
terests and their grievances. .. .

There are, moreover, matters
of student rights in the operation of
the educational program and it is
a part of the faculty’s professional

Youngberg: Change For Grinnetl

Open Letter to Glenn Leggett:

I think that there is a direction
Grinnell must change in to remain
a viable and competitive institu»
tion into the seventies.

Problem: The more capable and
competent students coming out of
American High Schools are increas-
ingly looking to college to supply
more than just a four year “grind”
which will place them in a position
to enter the best graduate schools.
No one doubts the need for rigor-
ous academicssspei‘haps, a new
“realism” has made their impor-
tance even more apparent-but
it need for the continual and con-
stant “humanlzlng” of our country
and culture has made intellectual
pursuits in a vacuum unacceptable.
The very practicality of [our years
of intellectual actiVity in a vacuum
can be questioned. A simple dic-
hotomy c‘ emphasis even for a col~
lege as small as Grinnell is called
for. By that, I mean that Grinnell
need not be so homogenous. Wecould
have programs and opportunities for
students who are not totally commitr
ted to the broadening oftheir formal
intellectual horizons. This wouldbas
lance our community and make this
a place where purely intellectual
pursuits would be complemented by
less intellectual ones-sand of
course, where community or Social
or nonlormal pursuits wouldbe com-
plemented by the intellectual atmos-
pherc
Therefore, a new emphasis on di-
versity is called for Course offer-
ings and academic policyare needed
which will encourage Students who
contribute to Gi'lnnell in nonraca-
demic ways This might go hand in
hand with an expansion of the sch-
ool, For example, specifically
Changes in the Art Department which
would make the facilities available
to llonrnlajors and non-academic
“artists". Generally: For you and
the Board of Trustees in conjunc—
tion with sources of input from the

rest of the Grinnell Community to
initiate a change in admission and
general policies to stimulatea more
balanced intellectual and social life
on campus. And thus deal with
our “social” problem For example,
“academic pressure" will increas-
ingly have to arise from “self-moi
tivation”--from within. The college
can offer a shelter for peopleﬁnot an
asylum. Graduate institutions and
the world at large areincreasingly
viewing initiative and selfrmo—
livauon as important and more im-
portant qualities in an individual.
Grinnell can not survive as at com»
petitive academic institution if it
does not attract and holderhope-
fully for four years-thinking, feelr
ing, and “committed” students.

r 5. Trying to change is alwaysaskr
mg for trouble. But, Life is change
and change is life. Certainly Grin-
nell policy makers have plans of
their own. college administration is
not my field. Nevertheless, Ithink
the effects of certain policy deciss
ions, whatever those decisions were,
can be felt adversely onthis campus.
You should not need to ask what
social problems we have. And, it
is apparent to me that our “social”
problem has importance beyond sups

business to understand and to pron
tect those rights. At the center of
these are students' rights to pro~
tection from fraud, incompetence
and various forms of malfeasance in
the educational operations of the
college. My View is the traditional
View, that it is the special profes-
sional role of the faculty to be in-
volved in protecting these rights oi
students. Now this is a sharply elie
tist structural proposition-sit posits
that professionalism is unique to the
faculty. As a faculty member I both
believe in professional discrimina—
tion and believe i understand the po»
wer limits for insuring that its func-
tioning is nonrabuslve, in any case,
i do not want the faculty, as a pron
fessional group, to encumber its own
professional sellrcritlcism and
operational flexibility by vesting any
non-professionals with “rights" in
its organizational structure. It is
hard enough to mobilize effectively
and to change organizationally when
it seems advisable to do so, without
having to go throuh some complex
routine of disestablishing vested pus
litlcal rights of students in order
to be able to move.

We now have a new procedure for
declaring the will of the faculty.
This procedure was set forth by Pro-
fessor Bodunrin in his presentation
to the faculty on Tuesday, November
21, and affirmed by President Leg-
gett. is I understand it, the pro-
cedure is as follows- if a state-
ment about Faculty will (custom,
common law, understanding, etc.)
be duly published in the Grinnell
College Scarlet and Black, and it go
unchallenged, then it is understood
to be indeed the will of the faculty.
I hereby hasten to publish my view
of the will of the faculty on the gen-
eral question of student participa—
tion in the faculty’s decision-make
ing system, to Wit: “Student partici-
pation in the business of the faculty
is by invitation of the Faculty. Such
invitation is not to be confused with
students’ organization and decision
making systemsor with the gener— ,
all rights of students as members of
the college community.”
