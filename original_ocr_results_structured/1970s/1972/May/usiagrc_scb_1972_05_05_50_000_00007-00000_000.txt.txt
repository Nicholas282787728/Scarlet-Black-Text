.lpparently at the time the contract

cording to lialph Pomerenk, the
cilthilck was ordered partly because
students were asking maids not to

on lllZHHIUIidHCL' costs, the college
decided to eliminate room cleanr
iiig arid assign two halls to each

several “float" maids to fill in
where needed No personnel were
tired in the process ol changing over

maids were hired to fill positions
vacated by retirement,

much work under the present setup.

situation is too Ilzld. One mziid,

At the time OI the union Strike,
there Wits much EM} sentiment
against director Dale ltawn Many
Ielt he wits ilndiplolnatic toward
workers, and was generally over-
heairng in his manner or manag~

ol this teeling still prevails, hut
in sorrie quarters it has been
countered bv ieelings oi respect ior

one housekeeper. Another maid
claimed that even though housekeeps
ers got a larger raise than grounds—
keepers in the contract, the pay gap
between men and women has be-
come wider through the years.
Pomerenk said the college believes
in the concept at equal pay ior
equal work, hut not all But; Jobs
require the same amount of work.
According to him groundswork and
janitor positions involve much more
heavy lilting and carrying, and the
weight of the work determines the
pay scale He Said there is no
specification or sex in ion deg
scriptlons, and women can apply for
positions other than housekeeping it
they so choose

Although there is some dissatis-
Iacilun in specific areas, the gene-
ral feeling toward the union is a
lavurable one, both among members
and among college administrators.
Among union members there is
satislaction With the guarantees of
lob and medical security. How-
ever, 3 prevalent View is that the
work ol the union is not yet com~
pleted “l’m satisﬁed to geta first
contract,” Said une Worker, “but
there's lots of changes to be made
now," ”NOW" refers to the nego-
tiations tor a new contract. Appa-
rently the idea of a written con-
tract was more important than were
the terms included in it two years
ago. As one B&G employee re-
lated, “a lot of things were accept-
ed to get the first contract, to kinda
get a tool in the door.” Further
progress uiTeamsters Local 30 will
be contingent upon the upcoming
contract negotiations.
