proposals, The task of working through
these proposals and lormulating a (com-
paratively) coherent statement tell to a
group of about thirty students who spent
their (all mid-sem in Grinnell, working
ten to eighteen hours a day in incredibly
lengthy meetings,

Finally, when the student body returned to
campus, they were presented with the “Stu-
dent Position Paper”. This paper outlined
an authority structure consisting of various
committees which administered four diff—
erent areas. “Student power” was achieved
in this perDSﬂl by determinations of the
ratio oi student, faculty, and administrative
memberships on the various groups. The
Position Paper also contained a lenghy ra—
tionale for student participation in “The
Decision-Making Process". The most
coherent proposals dealt with areas in which
students had had some experience: counr
seling, dorm lite, and administration or
some parts oi the college's physical plant,
such as the Forum, the food service, etc,
Proposals in the areas of academic admins
istration, participation on the Board of
Trustees, and general physical plant admins
istration betrayed, despite extensive re
search, the lack oi any real student experi»
ence in these areas.

Then came the problem of implementing
the proposals. Large meetings were held,
Votes taken, and dorms visited until strong
student support for the ideas in the Posir
tion Paper had been established. Discussion
and bargaining started, between representa-
tives oi the student power group andadmini—
strators. its Grinnellians began to assert
their innate inability to accept any proposal
as is, the Position Paper disappeared in all
but spirit, Also, as the year wore on, the
SGA members oi the bargaining group Der
gan to take over more oi the load, until,
with the spring elections, the SGA cabinet
(SGA president, C of HP president AWS
president, and student coordinator) became
the student reps in the bargaining group.
By this time, however, some progress had
been made. Committees with equal or ma-
jority student membership appeared in the
areas of student services, counseling, and
student rules and regulations, These groups
began to establish sub~committees to ads
minister their respective areas, As a re—
sult of some opposition and lack oi student
interest and knowledge, the matter of sins
dents on the Board of Trustees dropped
by the way. The main problems leit were
student power in the academic sphere, and
coordination of the various bodies already
established.

Discussion by this time had iallen into
a group called Committee A, a by—product
of one at president Leggett’s proposal
which was remarkably similar to an all-
college executive committee proposed in
the Position Paperi Committee A was the
SGA cabinet, leading administrators, and
leading laculty members. Through the
spring and fall at 1970, this group met, dis-
cussing proposals and Counter—proposals,
each group reporting back to its constir
tuency periodically. The question oi acae
demic participation was a sticky one, prim
marily due to extreme iaCulty resistance
to giving students anything more than ails
visory power. Although the discussion oi
the issue was occasionally overshadow ed by
the debate on requirements, a proposal
finally emerged.

Basically, it involved including students in
departmental and divisional EPC's and on
a new sub—Committee oithe Executive Coun-
cil, called the Alerollege EPC. This pro-
posal was eventually passed.

By this time, the student power movement
has ceased to exist as a separate iorce.
During the last two years, however, it
has at least produced something. Whether
it has been a success or not is still highly
debatable. The original goal of at least the
core group was substantive (that is, more
than advisory) student participation in all
decisions oi the college, However, people
realized early on that the ultimate power
in the college was the Board of Trustees,
and, the president, as their representative
Student control has been realized over much
of student life that was formerly under Con-
trol of the deans in the Office of Student
Ailalrs or the Business Office. However,
in order to deal with the problem, mentioned
above, or the indeiinite locus or power, a
bewildering new bureaucracy has appeared,
and its complexity discourages many slur
dents from participation, An additional
problem is that, although students have oir
iically been granted power, many people
still regard them as "only sources oi
opinion”, with the result that their (197
cisions are sometimes ignored or just not
sought. This is made possible by the maze
oi committees, in which students are often
unsure as to their Jurisdiction, and as
to who is supposed to do what with their
decisions

In some areas, oi course, students have
not even officially been raised above the

opinion source status. This is most ob»
vious in the nreli of academics, where events
oi this year have clearly shown the faCr
ulty’s tenacious hold on linal autonomy.
students have shown through the year that
they are yet interested in obtaining some
say in this realm.

The iailures oi the student power move-
ment can be seen as due to the tendency
to extreme bureaucratic solutions and the
resistance of Faculty and administrators
in certain areas. The successesnwell,
keeping up with the interminable committee
appointments is a hassle, but we do have
co~ops, changes in the food service, and
dorm selfrgovernment, among other things,
to show. Perhaps as students become res
cognized as legitimate iii the power struc-
ttlre, lessening oi the bureaucracy and
larger areas of authority will appear How-
ever, lt is iaii-ly certain that no extension
oi student power will happen without the
energetic assertion by students of their
demands for participation.

ROTC, Med
School, Are
Issues At Brown

by Joseph F. Wall,
Dean oi the College and
Parker Prolessor of History

Back in January, Just prior to my leaving

Grinnell, l promised the editors oi the
son that alter getting settled in at Brown
University, I would write a letter for the
paper, giving some impressions oi this aca-
demic community. Now suddenly lfind that the
semester is nearly over and little time
remains to fulfill that promise,

It has been a good semester, and the time
has gone much too quickly I have taught one
class, iormally labelled, An Economic
History oi the United States from 1865—
1915, but which I have interpreted rather
loosely as a socio-economic study
oi American industrial-urban culture during
that iormative period, and which is popu-
larly known on the campus as Carnegie 162
There are 25 students in the class, all men
uniortunately, and on first reading oithe Class
role. I was somewhat dismayed by the difv
ierences in academic experience among the
students, ranging irom one secondrsemester,
undergraduate ircshman to three second year
graduate students. Brown has a truly open
curriculum, and in the history department at
least there are no prerequisites ior any oi
the courses. Judging from my class, this
apparently works well, and with one or two
exceptions, l have iound my students to be
uniiormly good. I have established dliierent
writing requirementsnand expectations/for
the three graduate students, but the under
graduate students, including the lreshman,
have been neither inimidatcd nor outclassed
by the graduate students. This arrangement oi
shared classes is indicative of the general
academic climate at Brown. Compared to the
great state multiversities, or'even the large
private universities such as Columbia or
Chicago, Brown has continued to emphasize
its undergraduate liberal arts program, which
means an emphasis upon teaching and a
primary concern tor the undergraduate slur
dent.

Brown was one of the first schools to drop
specliic general education requirements. it
is now in its iourth year oi experience with
an open curriculum, and both the iaculty
and the students are generally satisfied with
that experience. I have heard no suggestion
that course requirements be re-estnblislted,
even irom among those who originally op-
posed the change. As has been true else
where, modern ioreign languages have suir
fered tlle most in declining student enrolls
ments, but as the French and Gei’lnandepart-
merits had originally taken the lead in iavoi»
ing the abolition of general education
requirements, they have not made any public
expressions of regret.

Both in the classroom and in respect lo
the curriculum, 1 have felt very much at home
here. In general campus mood, as well,
there are no marked differences from that
prevailing at Grinnell, Alter the storm and
stress oi two years ago, there is a quiet
which some students decry as apathy, which
some cynical fnculty attribute to students no
longer being so lnimediateiv threatened with
the draft, but which most students here can
simply ouiet desperation. l hail |o be in New
York on Friday, April 21st, so my win:
and I stayed over on Saturday to march in
the anti-war parade from West 74th Street

With most of the Concerned students either

this has due to absenteeism or protest, it
was hard to say. The lollowing week, u public

The most piessing issues on the campus
fills spring tiitvc been not the war but whether
Brown Should osirtlllish a medical school,

whether NRDTC should be Continued after
this year, and whether there is discrimination
against women in Brown’s admission policies.
0n the iirst issue, the administration won in
its push to get the first medical school in.
the state against the strong opposition of those
faculty who felt a) that Brown couldn’t afford
it; b) that a medical school would weaken
the traditional liberal arts character of the
university; and c) that the promised state aid
would be Just another step in turning aprivate
university into a public institution. 0n the
second issue, the administration lost in its
efforts to renew the ROTC contract with the
Navy Department. By 3371 margin, the iaculty
voted to cancel the program as of June lst
this year, The third issue remains unre-
solved. The present ratio of men to women
among the student body is 3 to 1, and with the
abolition of Pembroke College last year, stu-
dents are demanding "equal admission for
women” for the freshmen class next year.
Over all, oi coursenand this too has a
iamlllar ringuhangs the shadow of the
budget. Brown will have a budgeted deficit oi
one and a hall million dollars next year. As
is true [or most educational institutions, the
financial issue may be more critical to
Brown's future than either curricular changes
or admissions policies As We have been
trying to do at Grinnell, Brown is in the
process oi taking a long, hard look at its
priorities

Last week, Raphael Littauer in the New
York Times reported that the cost to the
American taxpayer for Just the actual bombs
that are expended in Viet Nam is 20 million
dollars every 24 hours. This would suggest
that the urgent need for considering priorities
should not be limited to Colleges and universi-
ties And like King Chai‘les's head for that
other poor Mr. Dick, in Dicken‘s David
Copperfield, Viel Nztin is our murdered
ghost that Can’t he wished or bombed away.
