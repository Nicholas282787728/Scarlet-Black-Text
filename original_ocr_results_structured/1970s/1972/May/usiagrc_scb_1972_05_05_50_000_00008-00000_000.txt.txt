The Scarlet and Black

Runners Encouraged

by Chris Madson

When we went to Central last week,
it wasn't miningrtlireatening, but,
tor the most port, a surprisingly
good day compared to what we have
heen running in. As i warmed tip
for the Vault, I contemplated the cold
east wind and the low tlymg murk,
amazed that there was no rain ltlllr

lng out of those clouds The sky
looked like a bad bruise, but there
was no min. As we got out oi the
station wagons, Conch Obel‘miller
started counting heads and made
another amazing discovery. The
whole team had come to the meet I
saw people there i hadn't seen tor
months The third amazing discov-
ery M the trip cztme when the dust
from the mile relay had settled,
and We [Dund out thilt We really
had won.

All the people that normally do
well did it again this tllne. Chuck
McGrthh got out of his Sick bed and
set new records in tile mile (419.3)
and the three mile Dart Hildebrand
followed him in to the tape in both
events. Dave Wright won ttie long
yump and was edged out in ttie
triple jump by hall an inch on his
opponent’s last jump The vaulter
hurtled over 14 feet, then [ﬁlled in
his bid [or it new meet record at
14’2”, Barry Hull took 21 Second in
the Shot put and It lourth in the £1157

the 440 intermediate hurdles, then
Came back wlth It line quilrtel’rnllle

tant second place John Hessburg
brought his quarterrmtle time down
