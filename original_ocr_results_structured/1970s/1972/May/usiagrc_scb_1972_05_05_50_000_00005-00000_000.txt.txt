Where To Vote?

We believe the arguments stated in a recent circular urging
students to vote in Grinnell this summer and {all are overstated
and incomplete,

May 5, I972

The writers of the circular -- one of whom is working for a
Democratic candidate lor Congress from this district ,, un-
doubtzibly have good intentions They feel the races in Iowa this
year are important, and they would like to have usually liberal
and Democratic students voting here. They apparently see
student voting as potentially decisive in the First District Cori—
gressional race, and important in the gubernatorial race, and
they hope to make it u major force in lowzt politics,

The fact is, however, that student voting is not powerful because

it occurs in one place or another, btit Simply because it occurs.
Students who vote at home will be exercising as much voting
power there as they would here ._ and in most cases (because
many students live in big cities and in large industrial states)
they Will be exercising ii in more races and more important
races.

The congressional race here, for example, iS perhaps the most
hotly contested and most marginal race in which students voting
in Grinnell are likely to become involved. The choice that will
be made at the polls in the August primary and November elec—
tion, however, is one of men rather than or policies or ideolo—
gies: the victor of the primary fight between two experienced,
liberal Democrats will [ace the incumbent, a liberal Republican in
November. If every congressional district had candidates of
of the caliber and ideas as the First District of Iowa, the nation
would be in much better shape politically than it is now, in our
opinion,

Other political races, both in the primary -- which will occur in
August, when most students are outside of Grinnell and would
have to get absentee ballots -- and in the election do not seem to
us to be races that Students Should go out of their way to vote in.
The Senate race this tall will pit a largely unknown liberal De-
mocrat against the very Widely known and popular incumbent,
Jack Miller, n conservative Republican. Miller’s victory might
its well be formal today for all the uncertainty there is in that
contest, Several of the lnost important races In lown ,, which
have in the past year received surprisingly little attention lrom
students 7— are similarly either between two or more progressive
candidates or are not close contests.

The above assessment is otir own judgment —— and Greg Vranicar
and Marc Talbert will undoubtably disagree, What is important,
though, is that students vote where they feel they are honestly
knowledgable about the issues and the candidates, and where they
feel their votes will affect signi cant contests. We suspect that
in many cases both of these conditions will lead students to vote
in their home states, They Will then be voting in states in which
they hztve (and have had) it long term interest, ones in which the
problems of government and the politicians who are asking to
deal with those problems, are familiar.

In addition, most students who vote at home will vote not olily
for President and representatives in Congress but for state and
local oftlcials e and generally. they will be state and city offl~
cials who must deal with the problems of urban society that the
student voters know well from their own experience. They can
much better judge between candidates for these positions than
they can for state dnd local officials in Iowa —- where the major
problems are related to agriculture in the state and new sewage
systems in Grinnell, issues which do not catch the imagination
of Grinnell students.

We do not want to downpluy what can be a constructive attempt
by some students to chose the area in which they vote, given the
options that most of us have, on the buSis of the ease of voting
and the most important contests. But we seriously think these
conditions will work in favor of students voting at home in the
great majority of cases, and we are arraid that the pressure that
is being exerted for students to vote in Grinnell may obscure
these advantages to voting at home Certainly any Grinnell
student from an urban area in the neighboring states of Illinois
and Missouri Will have u better chance to get at more corruption,
reactionary politicians, and general bad government simply by
voting zit home in 1972 than they could get at in lawn in the next
ten years.
