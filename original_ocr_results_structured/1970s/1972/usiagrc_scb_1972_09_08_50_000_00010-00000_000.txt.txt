Career Services.

“A student entering Grinnell to
day needs to realize that he or she
is no longer headed toward a one
choice career,” says Mrs. Daly."
Statistics show we can anticipate

The question oi Careers will go
deeper than Do I want to be a

I Want to do with my life?”

about what you want to do after
Grinnell or thoughts about what
you want to do with your Grinnell
experience, the Career Services ol-
iice is a good place to explore them ”

French Dept. Aide Finds America Differen

115;. v»

by Elaine Carey

Only a touch of nostalgia for the
food and girlfriends in France is
felt by Mr. Vincent Boutiu of Poi-
tiars, France who is this year ser-
ving as a language aid in the French
department.

Boutin, 24. is considering making
America his home because “in
America they look ior the iuture
and in France they look in thepast.”

Money is another iactor that leads
Boutin to believe that America would
be a good home because he says that
the French waste too much time
working and thinking about money.
Although they think about money in
America too, he stated, the emphar
sis is not as great as in France.

Coming irom a iamily oi iour in
Poitiars between Paris and Bor-
deaux, Boutin, attended high school
in Paris and majored in political
science at the University of Gre-

Grinnell Becomes 2 Pizza Town

A Grinnell College institution, of
sorts, died this summer, a victim

because they notonly provided sandy

During the rush season, (exams,

noble. He has also lived in Morocco
ior ten years. Hecompieted his miliv
tary service by serving six months
as a student pilot and six months as a
chiei secretary of an air squadron
at Tours. He is not the military
type he says, but the pilot’s school
was just to complete his duty.

Before arriving at Grinnell, Boutin
spent a month in England taking Eng-
lish courses at Portsmouth. His de-
cision to come toAmerica was based
on his desire to periect his English
and to know the American way or
life and civilization. The Amity In~
Stitute was responsible fordirecting
him to Grinnell.

Caliiornia, Washington, New Mexi-
co, Arizona, Virginia, Louisiana,
Florida, Wyoming, and Pennsylvania
are the places in the United States
he would like to visit most. Cali—
fornia was one of his choices be-
cause “it is the best place inAmerr
ica and all new things are there,"
while he listed Wyoming because
“it is more typical oi America.”
New Mexico and Arizona would prOr
vide a western atmosphere while
Washington is the home of a friend.

As ior Boutin's impressions oi
Grinnell College, he thinks it is
“very good" because of the small
student body, the organization oi
the school, and the arrangement
or the campus buildings “in har-
mony with nature,” Even though
Grinnell is a Small town, there are
enough activities ior students, he
believes.

In comparing the French and Amer-
lcan students, Boutin thinks the
Americans at Grinnell study much
more than French students because
the French study only two months
before [inal exams while here they
study all the time Although students

. at Grinnell study a lot he notes that

they Still find time for music, art,
and cinema while in France most
students must work constantly topay
their parents ior school.

It is also advantageous that the
students come from all over and
live at Grinnell all year, so that
students know people irom allover,
he added, commenting that in France

most students live with their pa
ents while attending school.

Boutin has [mind difficulty in getti
to know people very well becaiis
oi the language barrier. His voca
ulary, he tools, is too superiici
to enable him to form close relatlo

The only negative {actor oi Gri

has been the small amount of ii

Although Boutin believes the call

to most universities in France, t
French have more interest in gel

fied by the amount of space devot
in newspapers and magazines i
