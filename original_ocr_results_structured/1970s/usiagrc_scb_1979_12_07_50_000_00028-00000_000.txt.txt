He plays standing up (for the most

part) and flequently jumps in the air

and plays passages with his head and

leet. He does the vocal on the only
mellow piece in the sot.

Happy is quite a bit more restrain»
ed. He stands quietly off to the side,
smiling or occasionally saying a word
or two. Compared to the other three
out tront, he looks a bit out or place,
something like John Entwhistle of The
Who. (Funny how we keep getting
back to The Who), But the comparison
with Entwliistle doesn’t go much lur-
ther: ‘Happy is nowhere near as dar-
ing a bassist as his counterpart,
Nonetheless, he gets the job done,

Finally, there's Dennis Aalbers,
back behind the Ludwig drum set. He
looks more out of place than Happy
does. Aalbers' facxal expression rarely
changes. and it’s apparent he alwavs
has the situation in hand. His drumrr
ing is lovely and loud.

Put together, the Dentists pray rock

n’ roll as it was meant to be played:
loud and tight The sound is delighttul
to the ear much like a good
Bee'th‘oven symphony. But it s more
than that: that gets back to energy.

John Lennon once said something
like, “Rock ’n’ roll music skips the
head, and goes straight for the gut "
This probably best explains why so
many 'people like the Dentists. There’s
nothing radically dilierent about the
Dentists music compared with other
New Wave bands

Briggs explains, “New Wave' is
energyeit' s nothing new: the whole
energy of rock n roll, and the power,
the sheer emotion—that’s what its all

' , ,s_ a sort ot frustration. being
a teenager is a lot of it: being a kid
growing up: it’ s the energy"

That energy was apparent last Frir

day, especially as the band went
through an encore version of On thc
Verge, a song which is becoming thc'
Dentisls‘ trademark, The rousing pei‘r
tormance seemed to leave both the
hand and the audience exhausted.

Mastel'man said, “We have so much
energy when we're on stage, because I
know i don't have energy when we get
oti stage.”

But that kind or energy is allrtoor

lrequentl a destructive energy, The
Sex Pisto s, Keith Moon, Jimi Hen

drix. and probably some of those kill-
ed at The Who concert in Cincinnati
are some casualties to the hurningout
quality or this music,

But the Dentists don't feel they will
ever make the list oi those who have
”given their souls tor rock 'n' roll."
Grinker explains: “We‘re not stuck to

Mostermon gels into whot lie Singing
(obave): Mostermon and choker
per/eat an arrangement (let)

a certain type or music: we will he
playing punk for a while, but then
we’ll switch and do almost straight
rhythm and bluesiit's almost like
we’re a totally different band."

Masterman points out that they
have even composed a couple oi slow
love ballads, “just to prove that we
can be sens|tive."

The Dentists plan on being around
for a while, and, if things go as hoped,
they will be playing a couple more
concerts next semester. Their
manager, Joanne Davxdson, is also
looking into getting performances at
other places beSldes Grinnell.

This, however, may prove a pro
blem. Masterman feels that Iowa is
not the best environment for a punk

The Dentrsts’ (arm/y portrait

band: people here don't have the ex-
posure to New Wave that they have in
larger metropolitan areas.

Briggs points out, “I’ve seen bands
at hot clubs in New York City that we
play better than If we were in a dit-
ferent place, we would have no pro-
blem getting gigs, .Here, it s almost a
different culture "

Just how long the Dentists will last
remains to be seen. The fact remains,
each member is first a college student
and second a musician. As Aalbers
says, “There’s real potential tor the
group. However, i don’t think that
most members Will give up other
goals for the hand.”

For Masterman, that goal is to
become a “rock ’n’ roll lawyer," as he
sings in one of his songs. Briggs sees
himself eventually as a teacher.
Aalbers is unsure or his ruture goals,
and Happy and Grinker, while leaning
towards music, are also unsure.

But for the moment. the band is
playing together, and quite well at
that, They are happy together: “These
are the right people," Aalbers says;
Briggs adds, “I really do care about
the guys in the band, I think we all
do,”

And tor the most part, the campus
cares about the Dentists. There are
still some rough edges on their music,
but. nonetheless, the band is the most
exciting thing to happen at Grinnell
this year. As one recent graduate put
it: “When I heard the Dentists, I con-
sidered coming back and starting my
lour years over,”
