The sharing of
Grinne

by omnet J. Iiexter

One hundred and thirty odd
years alter Horace Greeley stood
by J.B. Grinnell and uttered his
words of wisdom. the President oi
Middlebury College looked AB.
Turner in the eye. and repeated
those timeless words: “Go West.
Young Man . So he did, and
soon after founded the first boys
club west or the Mississtppi .

Finals. spring '77. Time to look
back. Not just for Cumulative
exams. but to attempt to un-
derstand just what has happened in
the past reur years. in order to
possibly predict uhat is about to
happen in the next tour.

it is easy to remember my first
tew classes. Each protessor ate
tempted to make us think about
things most at us had never
thought about before. I remember
Mr Worley telling my lriends the
story or the student nho pushed
and pushed. but his typewriter
nevergot up that hill I think it was
called the luyth ot‘ SmithrCOrona
Still trash in my memory is litr,
Clottclter's lit-ave attempt to ex-

plain just why the ocean is near the
shore, Last but not least is Mr.
Grey's revelation that the
Lilliputians were correct in
cracking their eggs at the small
end. and why Brtmin never made
money off the discovery.

NOW We all know that too much
reminiscing is not good. We cannot
sit around and order another
Grabowski and at the same time
plan our tutures, But at the present
time it seems appropriate to think
about what we've learned. and Se?
how much or it can he applied in
the near future.

Maybe a good start would be to
think about the only time in my lite
I lived outside oi a large city. Most \
oi my friends were as surprised as
I to discover the student
musicians. actors, painters and
poets who have kept this place
alive after class each day Maybe
these people were just out tor the
applause, but 1 tend to believe that
they were actually the ones in
terested in the “Sharing of Grin-
nell."

What concerns me now is how
much the place has changed. How
many people will have the chance
to have the same experiences I've
had7 As alumni. we now can ask
questions or the administration and!
hope to receive answers which
satisfy our curiosities I'd like to
know how many black raculty and
students remain here in say. two‘
years. I’d like to know how many _
departments were toreed to close
oitlaeulty positions so that the new
football field can have astrOVturt to
match the grandstand. But most of
till I do intend to make use of the
best skill I have acquired here—-tlie
ability to identity BS by using my

AND BEST OF LUCK.
