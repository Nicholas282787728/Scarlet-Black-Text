ADVICE TD FRESHMEN.

Every class in college should have
its own distinctive cheer. A pleasantly
descriptive cry {or young heginners
like yourselves is “Rm 'a\\'-l‘£L\V.” The
chances are that that is what you will
he for at least onerhalf at your first
Year.

It. is well upon all occasions for
young collegians to get upon pleasant.-
ly friendly terms with their instruc-
tors, but the act of shipping the prose
ident of the college on the hacit and
addressing him to his lace as “Old
Hoss" is to he avoided,

   

Eschcw hazing ill so tar as you arc
able to do so. It is the height of tool-
islluess tor a boy i'rcsh iront school
to descend suddenly upon a group or
a dozen sophomores with tile intention
ot throwing them all into a duclonond.
We do not recall, in many years or ex
pcriencetl ohscrration or the ways or
college boys, a single case where such

an effort has turned out snccessl‘ully.|

Let your ambitions be in strict. ac-
cord with your physical ‘capaeity. A

he might reasonably hope to become

ion or his class.
