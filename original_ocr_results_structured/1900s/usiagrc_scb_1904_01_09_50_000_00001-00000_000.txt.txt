THE TRIP OF THE GLEE CLUE.

Me'rntiers Well Pleased With Success oi
theTtip.

The season of 19031904 marksi
the tenth anniversary of the Iowa
College Glee Club and makes the
club a continuous organization
equalled by but few or thewest.‘

During the Christmas vacation
occurred the annual trip of the
club. It was thought advisable for
various reasons to change the time
ofthetripfromthe Easter recessto
the Christmasholidays and the re
sult of this year's tour proves the
wisdom of the change, The club
lett Grinnell on Dec is and gave
eight concerts in all.

Owing to the change in the
management oi the club valuable
time was lost arranging the
itinerary and the idea ofa long
trip had to be abandoned. Yet
in spite oftltis handicap. owing
to the very efﬁcient management
of Mr. Hale Dottglass,tlle club en
joycd one of the most successful
and pleasant hips in its history,

Asrcgards the work done by
the clubit was of unitormly high
standard from start to ﬁnish and
proves the clubto be one oi thc
strongest lowa College has had.
The Griiinell quartet although
havtng but a short time to adjust
itself to the change in the second
bass part. wnsd valtlnblc and nlttcll
appreciated feature of the pro
gram. Probably no part of the
program was more pleasing to the
various audience-s than the violin
solos by Mr. Smith. fi‘Ir.Condit's

solos “are handled in his usual
masterly style and were (very
where warmly received. Good
and appreciative audiences were
the rule throughout, The home
concert oiiheclub will probably
be given March l8.

THE PIANOFDRTE AND SONG
RECTTAL

Thc chapel was nearly ﬁlled last
evening to hear the ﬁnal recital
at the series given by the school
of Music faculty during the ﬁrst
semester. It was gratifyin g
to Mr. Smith and Mr, Olds to
know that their productions are
thoroughly appreciated and en
joyed by Grinnell people.

The program was varied and of
such quality as to hold the close
attention of the audience during
the entire evening, Each number
was greeted with applause and
from the beginning of the program

to its conclusion everyone heartily
entered into the spirit of the pmr
ductions rendered.

Mr. Smith's is always
above par, and last evening he
was at his best. and it was difﬁcult
to say what piece was enjoyed the
most, Beethoven's "Sonata in F

work

sharp minor,op. 78," was interpret-
ed well, and the sllort runs in it
were perieci. Chopin's “Scherzo
in c slldrp minor. op. 39.” per.
haps, won the tuvorat the audience
moat. antl ill this Mr. Smith had a
chance to display histt-cliniqnc to
good advantage.

Large Number oi towactiilege Peer
pie Pres:nt.—Grinnell Spirit in
Evidence.

The annual banquet given by
the Des Moines alumni of Iowa
College at Plymouth Church. Des
Moines, on Thursday evening,
Dec. 29, was 2 distinct suc
cess from every point of victv.
About 125 alumni and friends of
the institution were in attendance
and it was purely a Grinnell affair.
The church was decorated with
the old familiar colors, scarlet and
black, and nearly everyone pres.
ent wore a badge of the colors
At frequent intervals the Grinnell
yells were given and tram the
noise which resulted, it was evi-
dent that the Grinncll spirit still
lived in the memory of the alumni
and that it could be revived at

the slightest provocation,

The ﬁrst address of the evening
was made by H, H. Slipp, presi»
dent of the local association, and
he took occasion to protest against
the commercial department of the
college, He said, “It should
be our aim, to maintain the
present atmosphere of the col-
lege, to strive after goodness, llot
bigness, and quality, not quantity,
We simulcl notjoill lnthe scramble
for more students, but should
rather keep up the requirements.
and in every way stiivc for the
of that
elevated point of
Grillnell
institutions.”

Dean Main and Prestdeut Bradr
ley responded to the remarks of
Mr, Stipp and assured the alumni
that it was not the intentions of
the faculty to saciiﬁce any of the
high ltlcals, already attatned by
the college.

The toast. “Griuncll \Ve Yell."
was responded to by Dean Mun
and in his cliaracieiistii: manner
set forth the aims and ideals ol
the college. He said. “Iowa Colr
lege has stiiven to maintain the
tdcnls for which it was founded.

and proposes to go on doing so.
lt,lias stiff requirements and pro
poses to maintain them.”

President Bradley spoke next
and gave an excellent talk on the
progressiveness and opportunities
of tlte college. He said, ”We can
limit the growth of the college.
only us the men and women, who
now comprise its faculty, go to
other places or are overwhelmed
by overwork.“

A sumptuous banquet was
served after which social toasts
were given by prominent edu-
cators who were present,£lnd the
