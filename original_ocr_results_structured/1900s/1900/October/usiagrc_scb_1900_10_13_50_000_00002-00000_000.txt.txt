Qﬁbitavial

Theselxlrinwhich society work
is being taken up this fall is cer-
tainly commendable. Society is
one of the phases of college life
which, though important. we are
wont to neglect. We do not ap-
preciate its value until our oppor-
tunity has vanished. This [all
more interest has been displayed
than in many preceding years and
we feel that it will never be res
gretted. Society work gives a
man poise when among his friends.
It also creates a fellowship which
in future years must certainly re»
call pleasant memories, and above
all we have that for which it stands
pre-eminentlyACulture in literary
work We would urge more to
embrace the Oppbrtullltyr It is
one of the best investments we
can make with our time. Do not
wait until your junior or senior
year, for if we can take the advice
of those who have entered into
this line or work, it pays to join at
once. Itisnotcollegecreditalonc
that we are seeking. but we are
striving to develop noble and in-
tellectual manhood and woman
hood.

HUMAN NATURE sometimes
shows itself in very contrary and
devious ways, and no where is this
more apparent at times than in
the average college student.
Sometimes this human nature is

in perfect harmony with its en-
vironment, ztncl then again it
breaks out diametrically opposed
to all conceivable circumstances
and conditions. The particular
point in the mind of the nriter is
one which has been there for some
time. and is being constantly
strengthened by experience and
observation. To exprcss that
point in a reworiei words, suppose
John is an oincialot some kind,
having charge of a Glee Club c’onr
cert or a track meet. Suppose
John asks Bill to give him a llttle
llelpiwhat does Bill do: does he
ask “what I do." Don't
thinl it‘ for a minute. His ﬁrst
thought and ﬁrst words are
“wllat’ll ye give nae“ This is the
point in mind. An ofﬁcial is ex-
pected to patiently and carelnlly
attend to all his duties at an tlnr
limited expense ot and
studies With no remuneration
whatever. But the idea seems to
be as ﬁrmly ﬁxed in the minds of
the majority or students as athle.
