The

 

Board of Control Act.
T0 the £001ch Mm a/Iowa College _.

The Board of Control of Ath»
letics hereby expresses its vote of
censure and entire disapproval of
a part of hinjesse Fellows' rela-
tions to the team in the season of
i900. In the question of Mr. Fel-
loivs' failure to appear at practice
during the last three weeks, there
has been a misunderstanding
which in a great measure excuses
him. Still the Board feels that
during the season he has failed in
several points to advance the in
terests of the team to the best of
his ability. In a school of this
size so much depends on the in»
dividual faithfulness of each ath-
lete that no greater cause (or con~
damnation could occur than a tails
ure to fulfill the trust given to each
by his position on any team.

One of the greatest athletic
needsin Grinnelltoday is the pres-
ence of a'traditio’n that every ath-
lete must give absolute obedie‘ cc
to every word of the coach. 'It
will be the policy of the Board of
Control to establish such a tradi-
tion by approving any extreme
measure deemed necessary by a
coach to enforce any reasonable
demands, even to the expulsion
from the team of any member
when such expulsion may mean
the loss of games or even chami
pionships.

In this connection Mr. Fellows
is not alone in overstepping what
was his duty to the coach. The
Board wishes also to condemn sev»
eral other members of the team
for the use of tobacco and for vials
ation of the hours for retiring as
required by Mr. Harris. A part
of the disgrace ot the large scores
run up against Grinnell rests on
every man who by violating the
rules at training has failed to per-
foot his physical condition to the
best of his ability. ”Grinnell

 

Spirit and Pluck” should mean
not only that dogged grit and en-
durance on the ﬁeld, but, as well,
taithfulness and obedience during
preparation for these games.
By order oi Board of Control,
I). E. SOMERS, Chairman.

The above reports in full the
action of the Board of Control
in the case recently referred to
them by the Athletic Union.
The statement appearing in the
last issue of the SCARLET AND
BLACK was very premature, and
apologies are offered tor making
public property at something
which was a purely private matter
at that time. The right of Mr.
Fellows to his “G" was not ques-
tioned by the Board for a mo-
ment. Atterhearingtheevidehee
from both sides, the Board found
that mutual misunderstandings
existed, and that both parties con»
cerned were in a measure at fault.
Mr. Fellows was out for practice
last night and certainly evinced a
desire to re-instate himself 'once
more in his tormer relation with
the team, ‘ v

Football Men.
Mention vlias made in last Satur-

day's SCARLET AND BLACK of the
meeting of all toothall men in the
gymnasium at I: 30 next Saturday
afternoon It is the intention to
have pictures taken of the whole
football squad, and so every foot-
ball man, regardless of whether
he is of the ﬁrst, second, third,
fourth, or ﬁfth team. or even if he
has only been out a few times,
should attend. The management
expressly desire that every man
who has had on a suit this year
should consider it his duty to be
present at the gymnasium next
Saturday.

Pres. Harper of the University
of Chicago at a recent meeting
severely criticized the action of
certain protessors who by their
indiscretions have lately aroused
the anger ofjohn D. Rockfeller.
