Rev, E H. H. Holman's Address.

‘ ‘l n: et-Lieei nt. Mr. Holman’s
address was “Christ and the labor
problem."

Of all the religious questions
the labor question is the greatest.
It touches the morals and habits
of all men. The kingdom ofGod
istoconquer the earth; sin and
despotism is to vanish when God
shall dwell with men.

God has aword for the individ~
rial and also for society, It must
be taken for granted that he who
changed the throne of God for the
manger deeply interested in
laboring mcn.

Conditions have come which
render the labor ploblem differ-
ent than it over was before. The
response of nature to our material
wants is wontlcrltll. Invention
has ﬁlled the land with machinery.
