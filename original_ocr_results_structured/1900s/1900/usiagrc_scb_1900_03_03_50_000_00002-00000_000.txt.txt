As HAS BEEh‘ previously men-
tioned in these columns, a gym-
nasium exhibition will be given
the latter part of the mouth at
the men'sgymnasium, 1n tormer
years when our gymnasium corr-
sisted ofa basement and a few
dumb bells andIndian clubs,some
efforts were attempted inthis line
and with remarkable success conr
sidering the scarcity ot apparatus.
Now that we are in possession ot
such an abundance or apparatus
and also of men, the old custom
can be renewed to good advan.
tage. Mr. Davis has charge at
the exhibition, and from what he
has seen of the men predicts a
very successtul affair, But to
make it a success, the men in the
gymnasium must do some hard,
earnest work and we \VlSh to take
this opportunity to urge the ne-
cessity of taking hold of this mat-
ter and pushing it to a successful
end. Let'each man select some
piece ot apparatus on which ire
can do the best work and keep at
it constantly rrntil he lrasmastered
the ﬁner points. In this way we
will be able to give a good exhi~
bition and inaugurate a good pre.
cedent to be followed in future
years.

Calocagathia.

Calocagathia met Friday after»
noon with an unusual number of
friends and visitors present. Al-
though a number of extra chairs
were brought in, alal‘ge number-
were compelled to stand during
the whole program.

The ﬁrst number on the pro.
gram was a vocal solo by Florence
Anger, with Ollie Myers at the
piano. Miss Anger's voice is
clear and sweet, and her song was
much enjoyed.

The rest of the program con-
sisted of a mock faculty meeting.

lasscmbled slouly about the table,‘r

some being late, as usual, Thei
customary line of business rvas‘
then taken up. Tire cases of sev.
eral ﬁunking students, and some
who were delinquent other
ways, were given a carclul and
impartial treatment. It was voted.
after much drscussion, that the
gii‘ls' petition for a tancy dress'
ball in the gymnasium be grantedl
lurss Martha Fulton presided over
the meeting wrtli selfrpossesslon
and dignity. Miss Nellie Clarke,
as Miss Millerd, made, perhaps,
the greatest impression on the
audience by her ﬁne acting, All
the protcssors were easily recog-
nized, the Misses Noel, Bruiitlett,
Miller and Romaine being espe-
cially worthy or mention, as they
had veryactivc parts. MrssHelen
Millerd gave a ﬁne presentation
ot Prot. Hendrixson and occupied
the ﬂoor a great part or the time.

The meeting, asa whole, was
very successful and very amusrng.

Cameo-Institute Play.

Tire custom of giving
society plays is one to be com-
mended. By it a very important
phase ot literary work is devel-
oped, while at the same time the
monotony of the regular society
program is broken.

This year it devolves upon Cal-
ocagathia and the Grrnnell Instir
tute to follow out this custom. A
joint committee from these are
ganlzations has been hard at work
the past two months, making all
preliminary arrangements,
their efforts lizivr: resulted in the
