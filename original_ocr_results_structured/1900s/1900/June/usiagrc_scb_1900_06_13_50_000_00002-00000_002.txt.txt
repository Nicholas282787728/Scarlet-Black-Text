ings. which in late years are grow-
ing more numerous Tire old no-
tions of a christian education, com-
ing only irom a church school, and
a godless education being the only
possible outcome of a state school,
are discarded. separation oi
church and state does not mean
antagonism; and severe sectarian
ism has yielded to a complacent,
eFﬁcicnt denominationalisnr

One criticism passed upon
church education is, that it does
not meet the test of the practical.
The college will exist through all
kinds of social and political evor
iution; for an ideal is the aim oi
the college man. and ideals are the
permanent goal oi young men and
women, regardless oi the changes
wrought by evolution.

The possibilities of Iowa's col-
lege and university graduates are
'limited only by the possibilities of
the nation. Iorva has great ma
terial resources. She has free lie
braries, free religions and sterling,
home-made virtues. From infancy

_ her inhabrtants have apparently
spent as much time iounding edu-
cational institutes as laying out
town.sites. In 1850, or there-
abouts, ﬁfty collegiate institutrons
were established; such was the
high principles and spirit oi the
pioneers.

The past history of Iowa Cole
lege. founded in prayer and cons
secration. has been glorious. What
of the future? 15 there any
danger involved in the many
changes which are about to take
place? The future of Iowa Col»
lege is as secure asthe past and
will be as glorious. She will go
on, and her graduates rvill go out
and redound honor to their Alma
Mater.

Horace Greeley once said to a
young man, “Go west.” Iowa
College is the result. President
Gates, in iollowing the same ad.
vice, carries with him the gratis
rude, affection and good wishes
of not only his own college but of
the state institutions amidst which
he has so long labored.

Sixty-six graduates received
diplomas at the hands of Pres.
Gates, and the commencement
exercises were at an end.

Changes for Next Year.

More changes will occur in the
faculty and various departments
of the college than ever before at
one time. The vacancy of the
president‘s chair is known to all
and needs no explanation. It is
still unﬁlled. Mrs. Cole. some
time ago, resigned her position as
head instructress in the piano de»
partment, but, being urgently re
quested by the trustees to with-
draw her resignation, she did so,
and will continue next year in her
present position. Miss Carrie

 

Rand re gns ironr her position as
dil‘cctress oi the larlies‘ gymna-
sium, allci seven years ol faithful,
unlemuucl'utive service ili that den
partrnent. Miss Raymond will
talrc hcr' place, and Mrs L. 1?.
Berry will be principal tor young
women. Principal Powell. of the
Academy, resigns to iirkc up other
work. Miss Warren is anxious to
irrrther pursrre her Latin studies
igns to. that purpose. Miss
Morris was absent during the past
winter on account of illrhcalth,
and not yet being able to resume
the work, her place will be ﬁlled
by Mrss Grace Henderson, as in.
structress and preccpiress of the
Academy. Proi,Enrery,desir-ing
to [urthcr pursue work in his
chosen line. Mr.Olds, of Beloit,
was elected to his position in the
Conservatory.

The iollowing gentlemen were
elected members ot the Board of
Trustees: Mr. Charles Duren of
Eldora, Rev. 1-1. M. Tuttle of
Manchester, Mr. N. B. Hawley,
'85, and Mr. H. H. Kennedy, '82.

The Alumni Games.

The baseball players (and some
others) among the alumni alight-
ed irom their respective trains,
asking it there was to be any
alumni games, and asserting that
“we heat you in ‘98.” To accom.
modate the “has beens" Manager
burd scraped together a ierv oi
our ”champions." and proceeded
to have a little enjoyment out oi
the boastful ”grads.” The ‘Varr
sity loated along each day until
the last innings and then won out
easily by scores o[13-9 and i2-io.
Tire star players were undeniably
upon the side of the alumni, espe
cially in their out-Field, where the
gymnastic performancesofClarke,
Powell and J. B. Grinnell were
phenomenal. Here Clarke‘s dive
under the carriages and Powell’s
long slide on one heel easily beat
any otGrinnell’s tumbling. Both
games were remarkable tor the
unquestioned decisions of the um-
pircs.

The attendance has not been as
large as expected. The games
were full oi fun and interest, and
repaid all who attended them.
