beneﬁt.

‘ Ellis.

Roll call at Ellis yesterday was
answered by the names and brief
sketches of prominent educators
of our country. ‘

The program was given over to
southern colleges and universi 'es.
The ﬁrst paper on Fiske Universi-
ty was given by Lena Ankerman.
Miss Ankerman gave a good ac-
count of the purpose and growth
or this important institution.

Gilinivere Craven next reviewed
the history of the University of
Virginia, dwelling especially upon
its prescl‘lt condition. The last
paper was on BookerT, Washing
ton and his work. by Clover Tallr
inon. Miss Tallnion's paper was
very well written and given in a
pleasing manner.

This was the ﬁrst appearance
otthesc three girls. Their work

on this program celtainly docs
crcdit to each. All spoke with
clearness and were not too closely
conﬁned to their papers. Ellis
will look forward to much good
walk from her new membeis this
year.

Music tor the program was
kindly furnished by Miss Forbnsh
and Miss Chase.

Calocagathia.

The program opened Friday
attcrnnon with a well given vocal
solo by Miss Portelﬁeld. The
work for the aftelnoon took the
term oi a debate, The question
was. Resolved. that the policy of
the present administration toward
foreign possessions is justiﬁable.
Miss Dryan and Miss Black very
creditaoly supported the afﬁrma
tive. while Miss Romaine and Miss
Goldsworthy did justice to the
negative. Both sides had done
good work in the debate. The
judges. Mrs. Robbins, Marie Sed-
ivick and Helen Starr, returned a
decision in favor of the afﬁrmative.
Miss Romaine and Miss Dryden
are to be especially commended
on the ground that they did not
depend quite so closely on their
written work. Miss Goldsworthy
presented her points from charts
ina business like manner that

would have done credit to a Cor-
nell—Grinnell debater.

The seniors of Minnesota Uni-
versity have adopted caps and
gowns. They are to be worn on
all prominent occasions through-
out the year.
