Athletic Union Meeting,

A meeting of tlleAtllletic Union
was held in Academy chapel ycs~
tcrday afternoon at three o'clock
The resignation of captain Foster,
oi the track team, was lead and
accepted. A committee from the
old track team proposed the name
of H, G. Lyman for captain, and
he was unanimously electcd. All
feel that we have a man at the
head of the team wllo will exert
every effort 'to make it a success.
Mr. Lyman immediately rcsigncd
as president of the Athletic Union
and Robt. McIntosh was elected
to ﬁll the position, L. L. Harris
was elected vice-president of the
Union to ﬁll the vacancy caused
by the resignation of Mr. McIn-
tosh. The Union decided to let
M. Blackburn and Austin Haines
settle the matter as to who should
have the “G” earned in the high
jump at the dual meet last spring,
between themselves. It will be re»
membered that they both jumped
the same height, dereating the
Iowa City men, but tailed to jump
off the tie, A resolution was read
from the football team, which pro-
posed to take Mr. Fellows’ “G“
away from him, and strike his
name from the roll of honor. It
was claimed that Mr, Fellows had
been disloyzl to the team. After
considerable discussion the matter
was referred to the board of Ath-
letic control. There seems to be
two sides to this question and the

matter should be thoroughly ins
vestigated bctore deﬁnite action is

taken.

Attention, Football Men!

This year is a notable one in
football circles, It has never been
duplicated in the past. and may
probably notbe repeated formany
years to come. Retcrcnce is made
to the surprising number of foot»
ballcandidateswhohaveappeared
upon the gridiron this tall. Fifty-

 

Flvc were reported to be out at
one time. We want this proud
record to be remembercd and per-
petualcd. No better way can be
devised ior accomplishing this
purpose than to have good photo-
gruphs scattered among the stu-
dents and friends of the college.
Arrangements have been made to
have such photographs taken at
Child's gallery on Saturday, Nov.
24th. Every football mall,whcther
of the ﬁrst, second, third, fourth
or ﬁfth team (if such a one is in
existence) is expected to be at
the men’s gymnasium, [:30 Saturr
day attcrnoon. Nobody must stay
away because he considers him-
self unimportant to our football
weltare. The photographs are to
be taken of all those interested in
football, and all candidates are ex»
pected to be there, Efforts will
be made to have the pictures ﬁrst-
class, and it is hoped a large num»
ber will be taken by college peo-

pie.

The Hacker Quartet.

A fair-sized audience greeted
tile members of the Hecker Quarr
tet at the Congregational church
last evening, The program was
opened by a string quartet which
enabled the entertainers to place
themselves in harmony, with their
audience at once. The hearty
reception of the ﬁrst number was
characteristic of the receptions of
all other numbers, every one of
which was excellent. It is not an
easy task for four people to fur-
nish entertainment to a restless
audience throughout a whole
evening. but the Hacker Quartet
seems to have done this lo the
entire satisfaction of its audience.
special mention should be made
of the vocal productions of Miss
Heclcer, who has a very sweet
voice, and ot the violin produc-
tions of Mr. Carl Hecker. This
concert was held under the sins
piccs of the ladies of the Congre~
gational church.
