Uitir—atter a ten years ot useless
and enervating competitioneuni-
ted under one management, The
double duties which by this are
raugement devolved upon the
Managing Editor were found to be
too arduous. and a separate editor
was soon chosen (or each publica-
tion. The two papers. however.
have Continued under one business
management until this year. It is
a pertinent {act that pertect syse
terns evolve but slowly from the
chaos of former attempts It is
now believed that a greater degree
of excellence can be attained un-
der separate business manage-
ment. and hereafter this plan will
be pursued. 7729 Unit board has
already elecied Mr. s. H. Crosby
Business Manager. and outlined an
aggressive policy for the coming
year: I/te Uni! will be greatly
improved in torm and makeup.
and it is the intention oi the board
to make it characteristically "an
exponent of the [ill/(try product of
the college." The SCARLET AND

and a few words of advice. New
students usually ﬁnd diFﬁculty in
determining just what amount of
time to devote to the various de-
partments ot the college. Some
have ﬁrmly resolved to study all
the limz; others are attracted by
athletics; still others by our muse
ical organizations. A true college
career combinesall these elements
and more. Don't study all the
time. Make it a point to exercise
daily between four and six in the
afternoon. the tlrne assigned for
recreation. Abundant opportunie
ties are afforded for systematic
exercise on the gridiron. track and
tennis court. Judicious tralnlng
aids the' stu‘dent’in his mental
work. Time spent thus is never
wasted Join one at the literary
societies which meets one evening
in the week. Don't wait until the
Junior. year. but join now that the
tull beneﬁts of the touryears may
be secured, From the society
halls come our orators and debat-
ers. In such an experience many
a public man ﬁnds the beginning
of his career. Make an early ac.
quaintance with the library; learn
how to use it for a library is the
greatest of educators. For one of
musical tastes, the Glee Club and
Amphion Orchestra turnish an
abundant ﬁeld {or work along that
line. The SCARLET AND BLACK
and the Um can give all those
something to do who wish to try
llterary work of any kind. 'These
departments embrace for the most
part all the phases ot our college
life. Each should be given its
share otattention. but just what
that share shall be the new stu-
dent may ﬁnd difﬁculty just at
ﬁrst in determining. Books he
will ﬁnd of paramount importance
of course. Other work, he will ale
so rind, will very soon tall in
its proper place Above all let
no new student get discouraged.
alittle time Is required for ad-
justment. Be patient and perse-
vering. and the year‘s work will
bring its own reward. SCARLET
AND BLACK predicts a strong year
in all lines of work. The indicae
trons point that way. Let the in»
terest and enthusiasm of the pres
ent continue. and theindicaiion

 

will he amply iulﬁllerl.
