Grinnell Defeated in a Fast Game
on a Muddy Field.

Playing the saino plucky gamc
she has played all season, Grin-
nell met another defeat at the
hands at Drake on Thanksgiving
day at Des Moines, Both learns
played tast ball for the condition
or the ﬁeld, mud being everywhere
and to almost any depth. Saw-
dust had been sprinkled over the
mud and improved matters some
what. About 2,500 admirers of
the two teams turned out to root
for the warriors whose colors they
wore, but in all the vast crowd of
enthusiasts not one tin horn was
in evidence. Capital City routers
had at last realized that for loot~
ing purposes lungs of leather are
tar superior to tubes or tin.

The game began promptly at
3o’cioc1. Grinncll won the toss
and chose the west goal. Drake
kicked 35 yards to Douglass who
returned 30 in one of the most
sensational runs of the game.

From the very ﬁrst Drake weight
had the best oi it on the slippery
ﬁeld. Her heavy line and backs
plungcd through the light Scarlet
and Black line tor steady gains.
Grinnell put rip a desperate de-
tcnsc but her opponent's offense
was equally determined. Drake
found the ends a haid proposition
but made gains through the line,

Score at end of ist half, Drake
i, Grinnell o.

In the second half Grinnell's
physical condition began to conic
into evidence. Drake secured
one touchdown and a goal in the
early part of the half and then
the wearers of the Scarlet and
Black took the offensive play in
to their own hands and iorcetl
Drake to the defensive. With
lthe exception of Drake‘s one
touchdown, the greater part of
the play was in her half oi tlle
field. Griniiell got [\et’ll‘ enough
to try two place kicks, one on the
lo yd. line, the other on the i5
yd. linc, but both were blocked,
At another time the ball was fum-
bled on the Blue and \Vhite six
yard line.

Presidency Declined.

Last week a formal statement,
declining the presidency ot'thc
college, was received riom Dr. F.
K. Sanders. This did not come
as a great surprise, because many
entertained doubts as to his ace
ccpting the cali, tor the reason

 

 

that hc was so long in announcing
his decision But it does come
as a great disappointment to truss
tees and students alike,
ders made a good impression
while here, and seems to be just
the man that ‘is needed totalt-e tip
the work which was so ably car-
ried on by Dr. Gates, ‘

Enlarged opportunities at Yale
is the reason assigned ior his de
cision.

A short extract tiom a letter
written by Dr. Sanders to agradir
ate of the college, shows how he
felt about declining. It follows:
“I appreciate all that you say
about town College, and it is with
real regret and almost disappoints
ment thatl have deemed it my
ditty to refuse the call thither.
There are virtually imperative
reasons whyI must remain here

at Yale, and thisI have come to

see clearly, i feel that there are
gieat opportunities at Iowa Col-
lege for a strong Cliiistian work.
and that a very consideiable de-
velopment of them is possible."

Recent Reports Concerning Dr.
Gates’ Future Work
Unreliable.

The daily papers or late have
contained numerous reports anti
alleged interviews in regard to
the future plans of Dr. Gates.
These reports assert that he has
decided to accept a call he has re-
ceived from a church in Colorado
oi-Wyoming,ivhichprovidcsabout
the kind of ﬁeld in which lie de~
sires to work. Such statements as
these are entirely unauthorized,
and, in the main, untrue. Dr.
Gates has been offered the presto
dency oi Talladcga College, Alas
bama, and has also received calls
to churches in various parts at the
country, but as yet has not accept
ed any call. in a letter to Prot.

Main, Dr, Gates expressly stated
that there were so many opportlis
nities opening up before him that
he was still undecided as to what
would be his future work.

,Thcre are several of the papers
of the state that seem to make it
their settled policy to distort anye
thing that refers either directly or
indirectly to Iowa College. The
tecundity and presumption of
some of these newspaper corrc~
spondents is truly wonderful, and
ifitwcrc not for the pernicious in-
fluence oIsome of their efforts the
result would be truly ludicrous.
