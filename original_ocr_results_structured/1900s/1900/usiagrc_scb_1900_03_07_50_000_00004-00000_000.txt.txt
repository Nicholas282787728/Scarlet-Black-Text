Scientific Association.

The Goodnow Scientiﬁc Asso-
ciation, at its meeting Monday
evening. had the pleasure or lis-
tening to extracts from Prof. Da-
vis'thesis, entitled, “Researches
in Cross Education." This thesis
was submitted to the faculty of
Yale University for the degree of
Ph. D. The subject was new to
the majority of the audience but
all were much interested, as was
shown by the discussion that fol-
lowed the paper.

Below we give ashort summary
of the thesis:

“The term, 'cross cducation,’
has been used to express the fact
that the effects of practice on one
side of,tlie body are transferred
to the unpracticed side.” In mak-
ing the investigations, three series
or experiments were carried out:
i. To determine the rapidity ot
voluntary effort. 2. To determine
the strength of 'voluntary effort.
3. To determine the accuracy oi
voluntary effort In 2I ”the re-
sults show very clearly that exer-
cise producing a gain in girth or
one arm causes a similar though
smaller gain in the other.”

"Here, it would seem, is a pron
vision by nature to prevent a one-
sidcd development, If the right
side of the body received all the
beneﬁt of its excess of exercise
over the left, it would tend to out-
grow it in much greater propor-
tion than is actually the case."

”An explanation oicrosseduca-
tion cannot as yet be completely
and satisfactorily made."

“The tollowingconclusionsmay
be drawn trom my own experie
mentsand those ofotherobservers:

The effects at exercise may be
transferred to a greater or less de-
gree trom the parts practiced to
other parts ot the body.

There is a close connection be-

 

tween different paits of the muse
cular system through nervous
means This connection is closet
between purts related in function
or in position.

Will power and attention are
educated by piiysicnl training
When developed hy any special
act they are developed for all otli~

er acts,
