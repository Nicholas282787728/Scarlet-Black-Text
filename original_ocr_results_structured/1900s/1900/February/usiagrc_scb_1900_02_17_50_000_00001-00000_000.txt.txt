Grinnell Institute.

Last Wednesday evening an ore
dinary program was given insteatl
oi the class program, so rnrrch in
vogue during the ﬁrst inontlt in
Grinnell Institute.

A leading by Craver was the
ﬁrst number, the selection being
one from Hopkinson Smitli’s“Tlre
Other Fellow.” The author was
very appropriately chosen. and it
was asort of prep' tion Ior the
coming lecture.

The second number was a man-
ologuc by Deiavan. The speaker
roamed at random among the cob-
webs of his brain. much to the
amusement of some or
ence.

Miss Kate Bray sang two solos,
which were treats to the soctcty.
The committee on music is to be
congratulated on his success thus
far in iurnislring excellent music.

“Some Questions of the Day."
were discussed by Staat. Socialr

Bryce say s our cillE\ are the true
conspicuous iaiIurc of the Amer

sorbs all the attention of men ‘and
politics is neglected and left to
political machines. Two problems
confront the city. that of organi-
zation and that of ctmtlol. An
equilibrum of political relations
and the proper placing or responr
sibility must be secured.

The question of the debate was:

has a right to compel arbitration
and an obedience to the decisrorls

The negative argued that the
decisions or an arbitrary court
