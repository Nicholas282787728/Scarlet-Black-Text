Q‘bhitnt u].

THERE is much on in
progress at the various tlnivei‘sir
ties, as to the ‘method to be
adopted otgr-antrng emblems to
members of debating learns. The
University otMichrgan darly says;
“It is the intention of the orator»
ical association to promote in-
terest in debating and oratory
by somewhat sirnilrnr methods, [7)
granting caps or ribbons, so that
‘lle who runs may read' and know
who the men are who have given
Michigan even a more prominent
name in debating than she enioys
in athletics. it is anticipated that
the contests for wearing these caps
or ribbons will be as great as now
exists tor the honor of wearing the
athletic “MN”

This seems to be it commend
able move and one which the crate
torical association and debating
league here might make to a good
advantage. While we would not
be in favor of the method speci-
Fred, oi wearing a ribbon or cap
as a distinguishing mark, yet we
do think that some emblem might
be easily arranged whicir could be
worn as a pin. 'The right to wear
this emblem could be granted Ultr
der similar conditions to those unr
dcr which the honor “G” is grant-
ed. For instance, the right tothis
emblem might be granted to any
representative of the college se-
curing better than fourth place in
the state oratorical contest or to
the members at a winning college
debating team. We are all aware
of the zeal with which our athletes
strive for the “G," and if this
change is made quite an addition
ai incentrve will be given to efforts
along these lines.

themselves in the hearty manner
characteristic of tool gatherings

Bright colored sheets of paper-

was the most artistic and amusing
assortment ot millincr-y ever exs

gentlemen were allowed to com~

Virginia reels, laughing matches

evening's enjoyment.

The fact that tile membership
of tool is smaller than ever this
year has lessened neitltel‘ cl; 5

Valentine Party.
In response to invttatrons issued

by the social committee, the class'

of 1903. kindly chaperoned by
Misses Millerd and l‘lnines antl
Messrs. Nolleli and Davis, met ill
the society halls last evening tor
a social gathering.

Institute hall was tastily decor-
ated with various valentines, reps
resenting different things, whose
rdentrty had been careiully cons
cealed. Most notable of these
was King cttpitl,wrtlr his never
tailing dart. Alter piercing two
large bleeding hearts he mounted
lrisgolden weapon’and glided sub-
tly through the air. and fortunate
indeed was lhe iiitlivirltiill who as
Caper] hrs enticing inﬂuence.

As the pleasurerseeli‘ers entered
the hall they were given paper
and pencil, and invtted to enter a
guessing contest as to what the
curiorrsly arranged valentines rep-
lesentetl,

After a great deal of merrimerit
had been created by the ludicrous
guesses, the judges awarded the
ﬁrst prizes to Miss Addie Morn-
son and Messrs. Young and wal
leser. Prof. Davis covered litm-
seit with glory by carrying on the
booby prize.

Suddenly nimble ﬁngers glided
over the piano Itcys and the ellr
livening strains oi “The Georgia
Camprmeetlllg” ﬂoated through
the air. “I’aitners for “The Vit-
ginia Reei‘” resorrnded through
the hall and youthtul steps were
soon tripping gayly to the charm
of muslc.

An oriental robe festoolletl with

a large heart quietly entered the
room and the astonished dancers
stood in blank amazement asthe
largehearttitasslowlytransformed
into many small hearts, seerng
their opportunity the young men
sailed bow and arrow and pro-
ceeclecl to shunt the little heart»
which, to their delight. contained
the names of the young ladies
whom they were to escort to re
fresllnlents.

Airer teasting upon lemon ice,
cakes and pleasant conversations,
the class dispersed, all rejoicing
that man is a social being.
