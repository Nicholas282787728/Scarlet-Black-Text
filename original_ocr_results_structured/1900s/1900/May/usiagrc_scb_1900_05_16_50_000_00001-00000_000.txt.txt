Academy Debate.

The ﬁrst annual debate between the
Lewis Literary Society and the Grill—
llell High
night. The High School auditorirrm
was packed with enthusiastic support»
ers of each side, ready to cheer their
team to victory. it was a typical
crowd, and the atmosphere was elecr
tric with intense interest.

Superintendent D. A. Thornburg,
who presided with unusual felicity,
announced an introductory mrrsical
number, a pleasing vocal duet by
Misses Sayre and Bump. Mr. Thorn-
burg read the rules governing the de»
bate. The question read: “Resolved,
that a constitutional amendment should
be secured by which senators shall be
elected by direct vote of the people."
The Academy was represented on the
afﬁrmative by W. A. Mcl 'ath, H. L.
James and C. R. Barnard; the High
School on the negative by L. G. Gay-
lord, G. Buchanan and Miss Kate Per-
sons. The judges were Hon. J. P.
Lyman, Rev. W. P. Stoddard alld
Prof. H. K. Edson. Each speaker had
twelve minutes in which to deliver his
argument and each side was allowed a
rebuttal.

Mr. Mcllrath opened for the aﬁirma-
live with the contention that the pres-
ent system is one of indirect represen-
tation and opposed to the principles
of free government. Reasons for the
adoption of the present system no
longer exist. Conservatism of the
Senate would not be lost, nor would
Slate Sovereignty be molested. Mr.
Mcllratlr spoke without notes and ill a
way that showed good grasp and
thorough knowledge of his subject.

Mr. Gaylord, the ﬁrst representa-
tive of the High School, began by
outlinirlg nine points which the attir—
mative mrrst prove. He maintained
that the conservatism of the Senate
depended upon the mode of election,
referring to the splendid history of the

Senate; ﬂhe proposed amendment

School was held last Friday '

he claimed is not the best. Mr. Gay»
lord ad his argument, and although
his voice was low, on the whole he
left a rather good impression on the
audience.

Mr. James, second speaker for the

aflirmative, began by successfully at-
tacking his opponent. He afﬁrmed
.that the people wish the reform; able
men will be sent to the Senate; dead-
locks will be prevented, present sys
tem lnay rob a state of its just reprer
seutation ill the National Senate. Mr.
James also spoke withorrt notes. His
argument was a valuable addition to
the afﬁrmative.
. Mr. Buchanan, Continuing for the
negative, said there would he an in~
crease in federal power over popular
elections and a closer fusioll of na-
tional and state issues. The proposed
system would terld towards a central
ization of power. Mr. Buchanan’s
argument was good, although he also
used manuscript.

Mr. Barnard tirade the, ﬁnal argu-
ment for the affirmative. He main»
tained that the proposed amendment
will improve the Senate by minimizV
lug corruption altd by removing pop
ular distrust; it will prevent the coil—
fusiou of state and national issues; it

with state legislative business. Mr.
Barnard showed great skill in present-
ing ltis argument.

Miss Persons, the last speaker on
the negative, declared that the pro-
posed system was more conducive to
fraud. There are no more rich men
ill the senate than in other public ofe
ﬁces ﬁlled by popular vote previous to
theirelection. Miss Persons was more
at ease on the stage than any of lter
colleagues, arld spoke in a low, clear
and impressive way.

Mr. Gaylord, in rebuttal, exhibited
several charts which he did not have
time to explain.

Mr. Barnard closed the debate in an
effective rebuttal, exhibiting two line
charts. The aﬂirmative had the best
of the debate in every way, their de»
livery being particularly good.

The High School gave two enjoya-
ble musical selections wllile the judges
were making up their decision. After
a series of yells from both sides, the
decision was ﬁnally announced as two
to one ill favor of the afﬁrmative.

Minneapolis Game.

The tirst big game of the season
will be played on the borne grounds
on Thursday afternoon, when the
Iowa college team will try to eﬁace
the memory of the two defeats rer
cently indicted by the ball tossers
from the University of Minnesota.
Since that time the team has been
thoroughly shaken rip and as a result
is able to play better ball than it has
been so far this year. Taft will be
ill his old place behind the bat; Fisk
will hold dowlt short»stop’s position;
Lindsay will be back at second base;
and Sanders will occupy the center
garden. In all pl'obabilty Clark will
pitch. The team have a long series
of defeats behind them artd will spare
no effort to make this game a victory.
Every student who can ought to go
and help them do it. The complaint
is often made that we have too few
big games here. Now we have a big
game alld it remains for its to patron-
ize it, ill order that we may have
more of the same kind in the future.
The Minnesota players have proved
that they can play good ball and the
game should be close and interesting,
and well worth the time and money
of those who attend.
