HOWEVER DISAPPOINTING the re
sult of the Dual Meet may be, we
cannot but feel some satisfaction at
the splendid spirit manifested through-
ollt. The continued evidences of sin—
cerity and good will existing between
the State University and Grinnell are
indeed gratifying, As a recent editor-
ial ill the Viclette-Reporter ably ex-
pressed . “We feel that the correct
way to look at the entire matter of
college athletics is that it does rlot
matter much what tlle results of the
contests, so they be clean, and pure,
and characterized by earnest endeavor
and friendly feeling to all.” it is
such considerations as these that make
the true success of athletic contests,
As an exhibition of college athletics
the meet was certainly all that could
be desired, and we have every reason
to feel prolld of tile showing of ollr
team. Grinnell expected every nlarl
to do his duty, and exery man re-
sponded nobly. in spite of the recent
reverses on the track, diamond, arld
tennis court, we have no reason to
be discouraged. Though we may
look back with longing to the times
when we won the state meet four
consecutive times and when we were
the undisputed champions in baseball,
football and tennis, we must realize
that only by hard, conscientious work
were these results attained Defeat,
instead of causing despondellcy,
should nerve us to rellewed ellorts.
Many times in the past has defeat
been turned into victory. Tlle season
has but just begun and there is ample
time to retrieve our fortunes. Every
member of our track, tennis, and
baseball teams deserves the heartiest
commendation for the faithful work
of the past montll. We ,may rest

assured that they will do their best.
Now is the time to give them ollr
lloyal support. We cannot all be
athletes or members of the respective
teams, but we call all give substantial
encouragement to their eﬁorts. Let
every student feel a personal respon-
sibility and we call bya united ex-
hibition of ”Grinnell spirit" contribute
materially to our success this spring,

Color Photography.

The fourth and last of the series of
lectures arranged under the University
Extension course, was delivered last
Monday evening by Professor Almy,

After giving brief mention of the at-
tempts made by recent scientists along
this line of work, Professor Almy ex7
plained and illustrated with stereoptir
con views the theory of light waves.
One wave may reinforce another and
thus produce light of more intensity,
or one may so cross another as to com-
pletely destroy its intensity and pro»
duce blackness Allotlrel striking per
culiarity of light is its composition.
Pure white light is composed of all the
known colors, which can easily be sep-
arated as is shown by the spectrum.
Scientists, by careful and painstaking
experiments, have learned to take ad
vantage of these facts, and, by means
of color screens, can produce natural
color scenes ill photography.

The lecture closed with some very
ﬁne slides of park scenes ill Chicago,
showing the beautiful eﬁ'ects and per-
fection to which color photography
has already attained.
