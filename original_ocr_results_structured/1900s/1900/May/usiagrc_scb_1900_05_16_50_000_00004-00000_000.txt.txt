Coe, ID; Grinneil, I6,

In a ragged arid lather uninterest-
inn game, Glinnell defeated the base-
ball aspirants thni Coe college at
Cedar Rapidslast Saturday. The Cedar
Rapids Republican lays all the blame
ot' Coe’s defeat on the absence of
Short-Stop Vetolicky, and it this is
the case, we are exceedingly tliallklul
{or Mr. Vetolicky’s failure to be on
hand, although he would have had
to be a player of unusual excellence
to bringl victory to his team on Sat-
urday. In the absence of Mr. Velo~
licky, the Coe team gave their battery
very imperfect support, and by dint
of eleven hits on their own part and
twelve errors by the enemy, Grinnell’s
representatives were enabled to win
without any undue exertion. The
Grillnell team showed the benefit of
several changes in position, and,
although somewhat careless, played
good ball for the most part, although
their Old trait of weakening in the
ninth inning was in evidence.

State Tournament.

The tournament of the State 'l'ennis
Associ ion, composed of the State
University, Cornell College, Penn Col-
lege and Orinnell, will be held on our
home courts on next Thursday and
Friday, weather permitting. Ill case
of rain, the playing will be carried on
in the men’s gymnasium.

The playing will begin pl'mnptly
at 7 0 o'clock each afternoon, the
preliminaries ill both singles and
doubles being held on Thursday, and
the ﬁnals on Friday. No admission
will be charged on Thursday, but for
Friday, when the finest playing will
be witnessed, the management has de-
cided to adopt the Y. M. C. A. plan
of admission, and all who attend will
be expected to contribute something.
Owing to the fact that the courts are
not enclosed, this is really the only
course which call be adopted, but it is
hoped that no student will attend the
tournament laboring under the delu-
sion that he is witnessing a tree enter-
tainment. All who are present will be
expected to pay something toward de-
fraying expenses, which are by no
means light this lyear. Seats will be
provided and every etiort made to en—
sure the comfort of the spectators.

The tournament should be well pat-
ronized as it will certainly be of inter-
est to all lovers of good tennis. The
best playelsin thefstate will be pres-
ent, and many of the matches bid fair
to be close and exciting, If well pate
ionized thisyeal', the tournament will,

in all probability, be transferred to
Grinnell permanently, which would
be exceedingly desirable We hope
that all who are iii any way able will
tuln oilt arid help make the tournar
ment the success which it ought to be.
