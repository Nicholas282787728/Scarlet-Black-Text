College Young Men's Christian
Association.

To the members and friends of
the Young Men's Christian Asso-
ciation this report is submitted:

The close of the Association
year is marked by the prevalence
or a hioad Christian sympathy in
the college community and a real
union of all Christian forces in
college. Particularly gratifying is
the interest and participation by
members of the Faculty in the
religious work.

The social life of the institution
is becoming more general and
democratic. It would be greatly
beneﬁted if there were some ade
quate social center. Little deﬁr
nite progress toward securing an
Association building can be re
ported. However, as the need tor
such equipment increases each
year this movement should be
constantly kept in mind and fur
thered in every possible way.

Social work is the great ﬁeld of
the college Association, and it is
the one ﬁeld here that yet remains
largely untouched. The large
numocrot men who attend college
each year, into whose lives there
comes little social enjoyment,
makes the duty at the Association
imperative to provide some sort
of social life for the student body
in common. The receptions given
in the (all when our enthusiasm
is high, are not sufﬁcient. In
the following weeks and months
when hard work claims the atten-
tionandinterest of the student.
when disappointment and home»
sickness are to be overcome, and
when temptations are to be met,
is the time comradeship should
be our tie and fellowship our com-
mon band. It would be wellto
eliminate the \vord “Association’
if only we could banish thereby
prejudices and mistaken ideas Cons

coining it, and bring in in its stend'

a siiong, manly fellow reeling
Two new features of iioik have
been added this year; Thc “As-
socvation" room. anti the “Ems
ploymeilt Bureau." Experiments
were made in both tllcsc lines and
some success attained in each, not
so much in what they havc already
accomplished, out as an indication
of the ﬁelds the Association may
occupy. The lecture colll'sc sup
plies a need of the community by
bringing eminent speakers and
entertainers llcl'c. Only the very
best available talent has been sc-
curcd. ’We havc had an excep-
tionally strong course this year,
and the committee deserves high
commendation.

The Bible study courses
ranged for, are of the very best.
but they should be biotight to the
attcntion of all students, anti spccV
ial efforts for lai-gcr enrollment
be made.

We wish to mention llelplul
visits from Fred 13. Smith, inter
national secretary, lri, c. Rose,
international secretary, and l. C.
Prall,state secretary. On glancing
over the ﬁeld and considering the
spirit Iowa College fosters, I am
most deeply impressed by the fuel
that the Christian Association
stands at the beginning of a giczit
work. It is to be stiongiy rcc~
omrnended that the tendency to
center in a comparatively low

men work and responsibility, be
counteracted and that special elr
torts be made to enlist all the men
in the work. There is a call from
no quarter calling upon us to sup
port the Association, but tl tale is
urgent responsibility upon every
man to he a liielid and comladc of
every tellow student. It is with
gratitude that it has been my
privilege to have been p’r itlcnt
