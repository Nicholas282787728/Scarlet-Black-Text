Qﬁhitorial

WE REGRET that W. J. Lindsay
‘Wilo has been the efficrent busir
ness manager of SCARLET AND
BLACK for the past two years has
been forced to resign because oi
his duties as captain of the base-
ball team. However it is with
pleasure that we announce to our
readers the‘ election of H. F.
Thompson, ’01, to the position left
vacant by Mr. Lindsay's resigna-
tion.

”—
ONLY Two weeks are left before
the date of the Cornelerrinnell
'debate, and as yet, nothing has
been done publicly to’ arouse
interest in this event. The time
is so short now, that immediate
steps should be taken. The seer
retary of the home league has
been making arrangements with
'tho railroad for a good rate and
undoubtedly will be able to secure
one that will permit a large crowd
. of students to attend the i900 de-
‘bate, Adeﬁnile rate will be an»
nounced in Wednesday’s issue oi
the SCARLET AND BLACK. The
disgraceful condition of affairs
which has characterized our form-
er debates at Cornell shoulrlnot
be repeated. Two years ago the
three debaters went to Mount
Vernon with absolutely no one to
support them. This year, With
the rate we will probably secure,
as large a crowd as usually attends
a big foot ball game or ﬁeld meet
should accompany them.
—o.s
SCARLET AND BLACK thinks it
not inappropriate to say a word
in recognition oi the gift of Mr.
E. A. Marsh, of a handsome clock
to each gymnasium.
