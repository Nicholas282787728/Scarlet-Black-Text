against 'Drake. relations between
her and Iowa schools have been
completely broken during the past
year; and, up to within a month,
these conditions seemed likely to
exist for some time to come. But,
about that time. Drake came for-
ward and frankly and honestlycon-
fessed that she was in the wrong,
and that the charges brought
against her were wellrIouilded.
She intimated tllat her policy here
after should be “purity in athlctr
ics," and expressed a strong de-
sire to again enter into athletic re-
lations with her neighboring cola
leges. Grinnellreeonsideredcare—
fully and, seconded by Iowa CltyI
yielded to this request. It is true
that Drake was in the wrong, but
who can say that this trouble was
all one-sided or that Gl'innell herr
selt was entirely free ironi blame?
Indeed, it is said. this Compliczlr
tion might have been avoided ii
mutual discretion had been exer-
cised. In View of these facts. it is
right thatwe meetthe candid, honr
est statements of a sister school in
the same spirit in whtclt they are
oﬁfered, and once more stand with
herupon an equal friendly looting,
The football management isplcas-
ed to inform the public that Grin-
nell has once more entered into
football relations with Drake. and
has already arranged two games
with her for next fall. It is hoped
that this period is only the begin-
ning ot a long era of successful

football games Rivalry there
must be, to be sure, btit only such
rivalry as is born of a true sports
man’s spirit; a rivalry resting up
on the solid foundation ot pure,
honest friendship.

 

is bound to protect from Boermis-
treatment. Sovereign states had
continually looked to England tor
adjusting their claims there, and
Transvaal representatives were ex-
cluded from the Hague Confer»
eucelastyearbecauseotEngland’s
relation to her.

In rebuttal otthe point made by
the negative, that England had re—
tused arbitration, he stated that
England could not arbitrate when
she herself was the arbitrating
power, without relinquishing her
sovereignty.

Mr. E. E. Blythe was the last
speaker for the negative. and de-
voted most of his time to rebuttal
and to strengthening the argument
of his colleagues. He referred
again to England's complicity in
the Jameson raid, stated that Eng-
land had relinquished her position
as the arbitrattng power by con-
senting to arbitrate in 1895, and
restated the Views oi the negative
With reference to the subject of
suzerainty.

Mr. Baker closed the debate for
the negative. and Mr. Quaiie for
the aFﬁrmativc. Both spoke well
and gave substantial aid to their
respective sides. Mr. Quaife’srer
huttal is worthy of spectal men»
tion.

During the intermission preced-
ing the decision of the judges, a
quartet consisting of Messrs. Par~
ish, Mitchell, Staat and Crandall
rendeied a number which was EX"
