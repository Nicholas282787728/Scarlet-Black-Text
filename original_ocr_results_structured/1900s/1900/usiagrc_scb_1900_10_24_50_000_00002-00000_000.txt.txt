This interesting trio of num-
bers is an invention of the second
team game played in Grinnell last
Saturday aIteriioon. It is a most
striking combination and has re-
sulted in a number of revelations
to at least one small party ot in-
dividuals. 97 represents the
number of tickets taken at the
gate; 24.60 is the amount of the
gate receipts; 39.05 is the debt
contracted by the game. 97 peo»

little team put up as gamy a ﬁght

A corporal's guard to encourage

This brings iorth the revelation
that Grinnell football is not a half.
nor a quarter. nor an eighth sup-
ported by her own college.
