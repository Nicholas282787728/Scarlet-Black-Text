Following the roll call. a piano
solo by Miss Verna Chase opened
the program, The curtains wercl
then drawn, disclosing a banquet
table, at which were seated twelve
aged Chrestos and Ellrses sup
posed to be present at a reunion
of the two societies ﬁtty yenrs
hence, in Manila. During the pro-
gianﬂ. a telegram from Pres. Gates
istill wcll and hearty, though al
most a Cc‘xltctlallangilllormed the
company of the reasons tor his
absence, Blanche Messenger. as
toastmaster. introduced each
speaker with appropriate remm I(S,
and the applause was tiequcnt
and hearty. The toast, "The El-
lis Girl 351 knew her," was re-
sponded to by Emma Johnson in
quite a witty manner.

Grandma Moody, a charming
old lady in her quaint cap and
gown, in her response to the toast,
"The Chresto Boy ct 1900,” re-
vealed some of the secret pranks
of those same boys. Susie Otvts,
the Ellis spinster, gave a history
of the members of the two sociee
ties, as she had learned of them
at a golden wedding recently at-
tended in Klondike. It was a (le-
cided comfort to learn that each
one had attained distinction.
Florence Anger, a renowned
prima donna, with Lulu Williams,
a distinguished musician as 30
companist, both of the next gen-
eration, delighted the company
withasolo, to which an encore
waskindly given. The Anniver-
sary Ode was given by Ruth Field,
whose volume of verses had been
translated into several languages.
Dr. Mary Coleman, in avery ine
teresting way, told ofthc changes
which had taken place on the
campus during the ﬁfty years
One innovation quite startling to
the company was the vast ball-
room in which Commencement
balls were held, The closing rcr
union songto the tune of “Suwr‘r
nee River," was read by Anna
Marsh, as the voices were too
cracked to attempt to sing it.

 

Calocagathia.

The program or the society Fri»
day afternoon was a little more
ambitious than usual, being a rep-
IC‘;6lllii\lOX\ in dramatic form of
Tennyson's “Dtcztm oi Fall’Vle'Il-

en." A stage background of pine

branches and olhei green gave lllei

sit estiun of the woodland sete
tings. Miss Katlleiinc Henderson
read the undrarnatic parts oi the
poem, and each character came
upon the stage and told her own
story, seveial historic women be-
lug added to the original to give a
greater vaiicty.

Millet-d Cleopatra
made a striking and impressive ﬁg-
ure, and gave her part with much
life and vigor.

Helen as

Olive Wilson as that Helen of
Truyforwhom”Munydtcwstvords
and died,” aetcd her palt Finely in
the little scene with lphigenia, who
was represented by Nellie Brow-
nell. Addie Morrison mutlc a
beautiful picture of that martyred
maiden, Jephthah's daughter, and
Nettie Sawyer as Joan of Arc,
quite captivated the audience.
Sappho, In the person of Man
garet McCormick Sang one other
own lyrics. A little scene be~
tween Queen Elizabeth and Mary
Stewart contained the most act-
ing quality, and was well rendered
by Ethel Salter-lee and Marion
Bruntlett as was also the part of
Ophelia by Blanche Noel. Othcr
tamotrs characters represented
were, Queen Eleanor by Hclcn
Leach. Fair Rosamond by
Teresa Black and Portia by
Orpha Pettit. A series of tab-
leaux was given at the last, color—
ed by calcium lights. The ef-
fect otthe whole was much heighte
erred by salt and dreamy mustc
trorn the piano, played by Helen
Thompson.
