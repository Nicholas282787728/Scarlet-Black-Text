As USUAL, at this period of the
the year, the college papers have
to face considerable hostile critic
cism. The assertiot’i is repeatedly
made that their columns are ﬁlled
with football matters to an entire
ly disproportionate extent and it
is occasionally even maintained
that football receives exclusive at-
tention. The present policy of
the SCARLET AND BLACK needs no
justiﬁcation, but because ive be-
lieve the above criticisms to be
unjust and untenable we cannot

Champion Iowa.

By ardecisive score of 28 to 5,
Iowa wrested from Michigan her
claim to the title of Champion of
the Northwest and now proudly
claims thattitle as her own. Nline
