Grinnell institute.

Grinnell Institute took a fresh
start last Wednesday evening
under very auspicious and inspire
ing conditions. A new constitu-
tion, new president and a good
strong program \vele the elements
which made the evening enjoyable
from start to ﬁnish.

Following the custom of assigns
ing every alternate meeting to a
class until all have participated.
the tvork of the winter term was
ushered, in by asenior program.
Philip Hadley Stevens led of! with
a talk on “Athletics.” The speak-
or took the conservative stand—
point that athletics occupy too
much time in college, brieﬂy re
viewed the history of Grecian
games. sports, cited the athletic
lite led by all people during the
times ot chivalry, afﬁrmed that
athletics are not at present a‘ dis—
tinct part of modern lite. but an
irrelative issue, and concluded by
saying that many people believed
that we were gradually working
toward the old Greek model.

Next came Parish with a “Chap-
el Talk" on the 'Uses of the Dic—
tionary." His talk was not only a
theoretical but a practical exam-
ple or the uses to which a diction-
ary should be put, as it abounded
in words whose volumninosity and
number were amazing. He cone
chided with many good sugges-

tions as to how our vocabulary can‘

be increased and our style perfects
ed by a wise use of the dictionary.

Crandall then read a true story
from Edgar Allen Poe, which was
belicvcd by everybody present,
Sonic of the more mature ones,
especially the seniors, looked a
little suspicious, but their suspic~
ion was ill-fountledi

The socialistic speech by Davis
was interesting and instructive.
He analyzed all people into two
classes, anarchists and socialists.
The anarchist believes in compe-
tition which is based on Selﬁsh-

 

iiess; the socialist believes in car
operation,based onthe law of love
and service. The Christian church
is necessarily socialistic as its one
great principle is that of service
and cooperation with teilownien.

Music was furnished by the
Misses Body. with which the so
ciety was well pleascd. A hearty
encore endeavored to elicit a secs
and selection, but in vain,

The program was concluded
with a "Roast” by Lindsay. After
tremblingly confessing that his
pure, chaste mind revolted from
“roasting.“ he launched forth into
a delineation of theincongruity
between the speaker on “Athlet-
ics" and the subject itself. Crane
dall. the true story man. so the
“roaster" asserted, is but an ex-
ample of the adage. “like mind.
like body." Hence his warped
and distorted physical appear»
Davis was likened to jet»
tcrson because he originated at new
constitution; like jackson because
he would not be downed, and like
Dicken's “Scrooge." because true
worth is hidden beneath his harsh
exterior.

Alter a stormy business meet
ing, in which both president and
members got no small amount of
parliamentary practice,thesociety
adjourned,

The program ot the society Frir

day afternoon was a Scottish pro

gram dealing with the life of the

people and with the poets and
writels of Scotland. Miss Addie

'Morrison. arrayed in a costume

or Highland plaids, gave a very
interesting account of the manners
of the people and their advance-
ment in culture, ending by sing.
ing a charming Scottish song
The costume added much to the
enjoyment ot the talk.

A sketch of the life of Robert
Burns was given by Ruth Brown.
together with a reading of seVr
eral or his best known poems.
Miss Brown spoke in a very pleas»
ing way. A sample or Scottish
music was given by Marie Bous»
quet, who sang “Annie Laurie.”
This wellrloved song was made
doubly enjoyable by Miss Bousr
quet's rendering of it.

Miss Mabel Richards spoke of
James Barrie and his popular book

 

“The Little Minister.” and read
some selections from the latter.

"Beside the Bonnie Brier Bush.”
and its author was the subject of
a talk by Miss Mamie Sto'erleiu.
One of the stories from this book
was read by Miss Stt'jerlein and
was one of the best numbers on
the program.

The singing of “Auld Lang
Syne" by the society closed a pro
gram every minute oi which was
enjoyed, but which. as a whole,
was a little too long.

Ellis.

The opening solo on Friday att-
ernoon, by Miss Stella Bartlett,
was exceptionally ﬁne, and the au
dience showed their appreciation
oiitby hearty applause. A large
number of visitors were present to
witness the presentation of “A
New Invention," under the man-
agement ot Eva Carothers. This
invention of Edison's, as Miss Ca-
rotliers explained, consists in the
application or electricity to rag
dolls. giving them a limited sup-
ply ot brain power, together with
the taculties of speech and loco-
motion. After a full explanation
or the apparatus used. as the prop-
er current was turned on. thc dolls
appeared betorethcaudicnce,each
in her turn. Rhyming Rebecca
delighted the audience with the
repetition of a number of her
rhymes. AgileAnn,whohad been
trained especially in music, sang a
solo, while the others joined in the
chorus. Greedy Gussie had not
been trained to pertorm alone, but
only in concert with Love-sick
Laura, Dancing Dorothy gave a
delighttul little German song, folr
lowed by a distinctly “rag dolly”
dance. Obstinate Ophelia was
lacking in some part or her make-
up, and consequently her actions
could not be predicted with cer—
tainty. Lively Lee gave an exhi—
bition of her powers of elocuiion.
and as a further accomplishment
was trained to quicken the move-
ment oi Sleepy Sally. who only
appeared after Lively Lee had
been sent for her.

A striking teature oi the pets
torinance was the singing of
“America" by all the dolls. Folr
lowing this part ot the program,
the dolls gave a series or tableaux:
