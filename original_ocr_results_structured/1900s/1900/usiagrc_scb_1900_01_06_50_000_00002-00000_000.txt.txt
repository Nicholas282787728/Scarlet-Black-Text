(Iléhitorial

Tue sweets-rs showed their ap-
preciation ot an opportunity of
hearing a wide-awake man like
Mr. Samuel Strauss, by their-large
attendance at his lecture last We
ening. That Mr. Strauss, a very
busy man,whose occupation needs
his especial attention at this time,
should give up one whole day tor
the students of Grinnell without
accepting so much as payment
for his hotel bill, shows afspirit
tor which we have nothing but
words of commendation. The
value of the lecture which was
along an entirely dirterent line
from any which have been given in
Grinnell in recent years, need not
be spoken or here, but we are sure
that we voice the sentiment of the
student body when we say that
another visit from Mr. Strauss
would be warmly welcomed.

THE SCARLET AND BLACK is very
glad to be able to‘ announce the
date tor a concert to be given un~
der the auspices of the Athletic
union. After much difﬁculty in
arranging a suitable date the Lon
don Glee singers have been see
cured for Monday evening, Janu-
ary 15. This company comes
very highly recommended and is
under the management of Mr.
Kersey, ’95. who writes that they
have given the utmost satisfaction
at every place where they have
been this season. We niighlstate
incidentally that they were se-
cured at Lincoln, Nebr., and they
drew a crowd of lgoo peoplc,while
many were turned away for lack
otroom. Theylmmedialelysigned

tor a return engagement. The

_ Athletic Union have gone to a

considerable expense in getting

these people here and it is hoped

that the students and citizens will

realize the merit or the company

and give them the attendance

which they deserve.

The ﬁrst program of the term
openened with the roll call, after
which tlle new president Miss Al-
lison, was escorted to the chair by
Eva Carothers and Susie Orvis.
In her address, the president
spoke ot the plan at work tor the
term. As is the custom of the
society, the subject tor study will
be literature, but no ﬁxed line of
work is to be followed. Every
fourth Friday a program will be
given under the management of
one of the seniors, the nature of
the program to be determined by
the one having that particular
meeting in charge. The ﬁrst of
such programs will be given next
week, under the management of
Eva Carothers,

Short talks on “An Ideal Christs
mas Vacation" were given by Fan»
nie Finer, Blanche Messenger and
Anna Marsh. The ﬁrst speaker
was especially ready and easy in
speaking, tho’ her voice was a lit
tle too low to be perfectly dis
tinct.

A piano solo by Miss Jessie
Harriman was heartily applauded.
The story describing Christmas
customs and festivities among the
Germans, given by Dorothea
Nath. was especially interesting
from the fact that the writer knew
so well whereof she spoke. The
closing number of the program
was the recital of Eugene Field's
poem, “The Night Wind." by May
McClannahan, which was com-

mendable for the clearness of
ellunclation fully as much as for
the sympathetic manner in which
it was rendered.
