Dual Meet.

The Dual‘ts‘ieldiMeet with the
State University will be held on
next Saturday afternoon at the
fair grounds, beginning promptly
at 2 o'clock. This will be the ﬁrst
dual meet which has been held in
Grinnell since 1896, as the one
which was to have been held here
in 1898 was called off on account
of rain. The meet this year prom
ises to be one of unusual interest.
Grinnell's best showing will prob-
ably be made in the sprints. The
wearers ot the old gold are sti Ollgr
er in most of the ﬁeld events. es
pecially the weights, and in the
long runs, while the hurdle races
should be close and exciting, The
side which wins the meet will
probably do so by a very narrow
margin, and victory will be un.
certain until the last event is over.

It is to be hoped that Grinnell
students will support their track
team as it deserves to be support
ed. We have had plenty of class
spirit this spring. but on next Satr
urday class spirit should be lost in
college spirit. our athletes need
all the support which we can give
them and are entitled to it. They
have done all that is in their paws
er, now it remains for us to do our
part.
