SOA RLE’ ‘ AND BLACK

are inclined to doubt that several
obyections were given all the atten-
tioir their seriousness entitled them
to when the rule was passed. The
following p'iints are submitted [or re-
consideration. A liberal interpres
trition leaves these objections as valid
as does a strict one:

It is not yust to make an honest
student wlio has had three h-
at driiererrt intervals during {our and
one-hair months share the pciraltyoi
a conﬁrmed ti-uant.

'It is a bad compliment to the in-
telligence oi the student body that
such coercive measures should be err-
forced.

For obvious reasons the rule would
re-act to the detriment oi debating
and athletics. What is the use oi
placing these enterprises undci- fur-
ther handicap?

The new rule does not allow nulli-
cieut room in which the individual
instructor may exercise clemency.

'It is said that the new rule is
but aterrtativo measure. The above
are only a few of the reasons why the
students are unanimous in the hope
that it may not outlive its period of
probation.
