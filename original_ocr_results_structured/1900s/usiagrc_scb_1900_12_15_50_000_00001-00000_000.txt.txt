almosttotally destroycdthegi-and
stand, dressing rooms, ofﬁces and
east and west bleachers at the
League Baseball park in Des
Moines, The ﬁre started in the
boiler room of the auditorium,
which adjoins the park, and was
under strong headway betorc it
was discovered. The stage Fix-
tuies and scenery oithe theater
were partially consumed, but the
building itself was saved. The
grand stand and bleachers, which
have been ﬁlled by so many en.
tltusiastic crowds of spectators at
the football games held in Des
Moines this season, were entirely
destroyed. The various struc—
tures at the park, including the
tencc, the greater part of which
was saved. were valued at 55,000.

Annual Oratoricai Contest.

The annual fall oratorical cone
test will be held in the college
chapel next Tuesday evening, be-
ginning at eight o‘clock. Besides
the SIX orations, there will be ﬁve
musical numbers, furnished by
some of the best talent in the col-
lege. The committee in charge
has taken especial pains to vary
the program so that it will not be-
cometiresome. The contest should
be spirited from start to ﬁnish, for
the boys have all worked hard on
their orations and each one is de-
sirous of winning one of the three
places and its accompanying prize.
The contestants are all under
classmen, and the judges on
thought and composition have
said that Iowa College is to be
congratulated upon the quality of
the work displayed in the orations.
This will be the ﬁrst public ap-
pearance for some of the compet-
itors, and citizens as well as stu-
dents should corne out to encoure
age them. Following is the pros

Extracts from a Letter.
EDi'roR SCARLET AND BLAC
Several of the alumni have felt for
some time that this column ought

the chief value of the paper to
alumni readers, but this year the
items are notably so inaccurate as
to make them absolutely unreli-
able. * * Many of the items
are due to carelessness alone. A
common error is in giving class
numbers. A faithful use of the
Quinquennial Registerwould rem—

supply alumni news to alumni

[SCARLET AND BLACK considers
the above letter as coming from a
true friend. The writer gave his
own ideas in plain language and
was not afraid to sign his name.
SCARLET AND BLACK is ever ready
to accept advice and hopes more

paper continues imperfect. But,
along with that advice, suppose
our alumni friends send occasional
interesting and reliable items
about themselves or others. Their
advice will then take a most sub-
stantially practical form, The
present weakness of this depart-

due partly to the faults cited above
and partly to natural dimculties in
the way. The staff has had rather
a hard time to ﬁll this column.

alumni centers through personal
appeal. It the alumni respond,

their labors to the utmost, and will
endeavor to effect the “reform” so
