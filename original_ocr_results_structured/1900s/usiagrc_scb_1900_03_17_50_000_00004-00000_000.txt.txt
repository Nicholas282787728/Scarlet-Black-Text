“Rcsnlvctl, That [I]. . Citalms

detrate uhich fotmtztl the literary

Misses Starr and Ilill, the itegar
live by Misses Martha Fulton
and Attwooli, Before the debate
opened, the ladies‘ quartet, Mes
dairies Vittum, lIcidct, and \Vhitr
eomh, and Miss Sawyer, sting one
number and responded to tire en-
corc tt'ltich litcii music coititl nnt
fail to win.

Miss Starr opened the debate
and made several good points tor-
the afﬁrmativc, among them the
facts that the present system tides
not represent the people, and that
choice by the people would der
crease the CUI‘ItlpthlL

The ﬁrst speaker- on the negzh
tive, Miss Fulton. said. among
other things,that tlicrc was no
reason to change iiniil thc prescnt
system was proved unsatistactory.
which had not as yet been done.
The pt eseitt system tends to check
hasty legislation, and has many
good points which the speaker
named.

Miss Hill up her cola
league’s line of argument and
added several points. Although
tlte speaker conﬁned her-scit to
her notes rather closely, her man
her and address were very please
tag and she made a good impres
sion.

Miss Attwoolt supported her
side or the question with some
arguments and spoke with an
easy and unconscious, manner.
After the rebuttal by the two
leaders. the decision of the judges
was given to the negative, The

and Atttvonll it was almost their
lﬁrst appearance in the society
work and they are both very
promising members.

After the decision Messrs, Eldr

suclcty with a banjo and guitar
duct and responded to an encore,
Both the selections neie ﬁnely
rendered and much appreciated.

The opening musical number of
the afternoon's pr ogram was given
by Lulu Williams, and met irith
the hearty applause which Itcrmti»
sic never fails to call forth.

Thiough the kindness of the E.
is. B, society, the society and vis-
iting iriends were favored with a
very enjoyable program. Tire
ﬁrst part consisted ot a scart Fun~
lAsthtte, given hynini: young Ia-
dics. ’l‘hc accompaniment of the
soft sweet music. the darkened
room, black background and arti-
ﬁctal lights, and the prnkeosiumes
ut the girls made the effect very
charming. The second part was
the recitation of “The Battle of
Blenheim" by Vinette I’lel’l'Oll,
with appropriate gestures by the
entire gtoup. This was so well
given that a repetition of a part
of it was necessary to satisfy the
audience. Tire program was con-
cluded by a number of beautiful
and effectively grouped tableaux,
The thanks of the society are due
the E, B. B’s for so pleasant an
entertainment.

At the business meeting the fol»
lowing ofﬁcers were elected to
serve during the spring term:
President, Fannie Finer; vice-
president, Ruth Field; recording
secretary, Grace Burton; correse
pending secretary, Eva Carotlters;
treasurer, Annie Slrrley.
