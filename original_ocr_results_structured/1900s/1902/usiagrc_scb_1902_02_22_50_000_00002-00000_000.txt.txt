HE amendment to the by»
laws oi the Intercollegiate
Association, recently adopted by
the games committee. will un
doubtedly meet with the full ap-
proval of the local unions. As the
rrrles were last year. it was neces
sary to send to the state secretary
a list of all the candidates com»
peting tor the team. and then
twelve days before the state meet
it was necessary to send a list of
four men for each event. tlle ﬁnal
contestants to be chosen from
tllese lists of four. Under the
amendment just adopted. the pro-
vision for sending in a list of all
the candidates is stricken otrt.
This will result in a saving o[ a
large amount or clerical work,
both on the part of tlle local and
state associations.

OMMENTING on the posi-
tion taken by SCARLET AND
BLACK in opposition to the giving
ot credit for college newspaper
work. the Daily [rm/m! closes with
this characteristic stir t e rn e n t:
"This sounds much like the pro»
verbial remark of the fox. in view
of the fact that the SC\RLET no
BLACK hoard tried to get such
credit not long since and were re-
fused.” Verily. one must go to
his neighbor's house to learn the
news of his own household. In
one very important respect the
statement quoted is exactly Sll’ni-
lar to that of our Cornell brother
git is not true. The SCARLET
AND BLACK board did not try
“not long since" to secure such
credit. No effort has been made
or will be made by the present
board to secure such credit. Fur
thermore. although editorials in
previous years have endorsed the
giving or credit. no cttort has ev
er been made. to our knowledge.
by any or our predecessors, to
get such credit. These statements
of trusts are given simply to keep
the records straight. They may
sound like the proverbial remark
or the fox. but they are true none
the less.

COMMENCEMENT Music.

It has been deﬁnitely decided
that the Musical Festival. given
by the Oratorio Association. will
occur at commencement time in-
stead ot in May as at ﬁrst under-
stood. There are many advant-
ages in this revised plan. The
longer time tor preparation and
the presence of commencement

visitors promise even a more suc-

cessful festival than last year. The
greatest result from the change is
that the commencement program
will contain a musical event of
the greatest importance. and art-
other reason is added why oul
next commencement will be of
unusual interest.
