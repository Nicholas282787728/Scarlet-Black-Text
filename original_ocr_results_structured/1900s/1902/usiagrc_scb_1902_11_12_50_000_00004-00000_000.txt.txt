FUDD‘NHEAD WILSON.

Tomorrow evening, Nov. t3,
MarkTwain'sgreat play will be
presented at the Colontal by Wm.
s. Gill and a strong company.
Pudd'nhcad \Uilson ts not
known to the Grinnell playrguing
public and those who have heard
him once are sitre to go to hear
him again. Mr. Wilson is a quaint
philosopher and those who know
liim ﬁnd that will each recurring
hearing there is more good sense
and quiet humor to be dlscovered
in the shrewd speech oi the law-
yer who never had a case out
who “limped to some day". This
is one ot the lew plays which is
presented season aitcr season
with undiminished sticc \Vhlle
lull ol his and bright humor it
has the touch of human interest

that arouses breathless inteiest
from the rising curtain till the
last act ol the court scene.

No one can help sympallllxing
with the hero norwtsliing to know
what the outcome ts to be. And
witlt itsstrong story and artistic
construction there is scarcely a
touch of the'larcical that hurts so
many otthecurtent dramas. The
play will be one ottlie best prer
sented in the west this season and
who does not hear tltc
will miss a

unr

story ot Pudd'nhead
great production.

MchlGANdoWA GAME,

Below is an account of
MinnesotafGrlnnell game as
printed by the [mud]: from a St,
Paul paper with names changed

to suit the Michiganelowa game.
lowaltas a profound contempt for
a team which would allow itself to

the

1' bebeaten bysuch an immense score

It further comparisons are neces
sary it might be mentioned that
Iowa has abouta thousand men,
students and boasts of a coach
whom they say cannot be equall-
ed. Grinnell has about one ﬁfth
as many male students. Names
have been changed to ﬁt the
tacts, “It was not a football game
it was a slaughter. Iowa came
boasting to hold the score below
twenty to nothing, Iowa staggered

 

off the ﬁeld too weak to talk and
almost too wenkto walk. For
about ﬁfteen seconds, while Pale
tner was preparing to kick off.
the game was exciting. The
kicking of the goals was the best
part of all for the Iowa players.
It gave them a chance to prepare
for the next smashing. The
game ended on Iowa's i5 yard
line and i5 yards looked like a
mere trifle to the Wolverines.
li a Michigan runner did not
make at least is yards, he was
denied applause. Anylhlng under
l5 yards was common place.
Alter the game the score was
ﬁgurcd up: Michlgan 107, Iowa 0 "
Belutvls also quoted a new
Iowa yell, said to have been sung
with great virn during the Michi-
gai. game.
~The third yell emphasizes the
weakness ot the varsity's oppoin
ent. It is sung to the tune.
”Here's to good old llarvard,
drink 'ter down, drink her down."
0 you'll be tired and sore,
Michigan! Michigan!
When you gettllrmlgh this
game.

You'll be sorry that you came.
