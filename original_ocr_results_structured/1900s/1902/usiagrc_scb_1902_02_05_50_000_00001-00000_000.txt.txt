The principle matter to conic
before the meeting Thursday was
the election of a president of the
Iowa Intercollegiate Amateur

A WORD ON MRS. BAKER.

The Next Number 0! the Lecture Course
to be a Rare Treatislatemenl from
Miss Smith,

For the beneﬁt of those who are
unfamiliar with Mrs. Beitha Kunz
Baker, who will appear in Grinncll
February r4, we give below the
opinion or Miss Gienna sinith con-
cerning this remarkable woman,
Miss Smith has come into person~
al contact with Mrs. Baker at va-
rious times. and her words, in cone
sequence have all the greater sig-
niﬁcance.

“The people of Iowa College are
soon to have the rare privilege of
hearing Mrs. Bertha Kunz Baker,
the woman who stands foremost
among the readers at this country.

“It is often unwise to speak in
too glowing terms of an artist in a
community where she is compara-
tively unknown, lest her appear-
ance bring with it something of
disappointment. Butamongthose
whose pleasure it has been to hear
and know this truly great woman
there is but one opinion, and that
is that she never fails to meet
every requirement.

“Mrs. Baker is the embodiment
of rare talents which she has wrse-
ly adapted to the great work in
which she is engaged. Supreme
among these is a deeply sympa-
thetic soul, and a personal mag-
netism which is not less than won-
derful. But Mrs. Baker does not
rely on natural gifts for her suc—
cess. She is a woman of scholar—
ly attainment, and the mastery of
her art is the result of earnest re-
Search.

“It would be well worth one's
while to spend an evening with
Mrs. Baker it only to see and teel
her noble womanhood, her genu~
lneness. her magnetic power and
her rare culture. Add to a won-
dertul voice, and a magniﬁcent
stage presence, a keen intelligence
and an intense sympathy with the
author's purpose, and the result is

a combination which gives [orce
and charm to her \votk.

“MrsBakeriswhatsheisthi‘ougli
conviction. She believes n the
nobility oi her art, and in its vast
opportunities. Shebelievesinmw
Z‘IZIN‘ﬂI‘L’IlZ/lO/l. In her there is no
artinciahty, no ettcct tor the sake
of effect, but [ml/z rings in every
tone and speaks in every move

“To miss Mls, Baker will be to
miss an inspiration"

c. v. HIBBARD IN GRINNELL.

Speaks to the Students about the Toronto
Convention eerinncll to Send
Delegation.

Yesterday evening in the chapel
Mr. c. V. Hibbard. secretary of
the Y. M. C. A., at Northwestern
University. addressed a small
number of the students. Histalk
was an informal one, but to the
point, and was deserving of a larg-
er hearing than it received. He
spoke in the interest of foreign
missionsidcaling especially with
the great international student
convention which will meet in
Toronto, Canada, on the twenty-
sixth of this month. This will
not only be the greatest misoionr
ary convention that has ever oer
curred, but will be also the larg-
est student gathering ever
held; and as such it is appealing
strongly to the students in all
parts oi North America. There
will. without doubt. be at least
twentyrﬁve hundred student dele-
gates present and the total enroll-
ment ot delegates will probably
reach the three thousand mark.

Just what part Glinnell will
have in the enrollment is not de
ﬁnitely settled. It is the plan, at
