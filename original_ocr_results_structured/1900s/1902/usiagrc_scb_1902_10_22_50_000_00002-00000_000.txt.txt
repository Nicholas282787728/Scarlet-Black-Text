team and on their victory
Saturday. but we do not admiie
the college spirit that shows itselt
in annoying women, as in snatchr
ing emblems and colors or making
ungentlemanly remarks. it is to
be hoped that those who were
guilty of such conduct were not
students of the State College.
Such conduct is disgraceful in
hoodlums from anywhere, but es-
pecially in those who, by college
associations, should have acquired
a better spirit,

HERE are some people who
cannot support a losing

team. we sincerely hope there
are no such persons in Grinnell.
Any one can support a team that
wins all its games but it takes
loyalty and courage to give the
same support to the team that is
beaten. For years Grinnell has
been second to none in Iowa athr
letics and more than once we have
defeated such teams as Minnesota
and Nebraska But we cannot al-
ways hope to win trorn schools
which have more men to choose
irom and more money to pay for
equipment and coaching. on
years lvill come. Indeed Grin-
nell’s success in football and track
has been phenomenal and such
success will not continue forever.
Nothing but the spirit of Grinitell
students and the support of town
and college have won these 5th»
cesses and when other schools,
xucl‘l as Drake and Iowa develop
a true athletic spirit. Grinnell can-
not expect to always deieat the
Universities. But the same spirit
may still exist and Grinnell will
still give her teams, whether
winning or losing. her hearty and
loyal support. The student who
hegins to deride the team or Com
plain ot coach and men as soon as
a game is lost is tar trom showing
a true sportsmanlike spirit. It
often takes more nerve to bea
game loser than to win athletic
contests. If Grinnell has her
limes when games are lost. we are
only going through what every
other school has experienced and
the thing to do is to lose gamely,
and support the team through
thick and thin,

A TALK oN THE COAL STRIKE.
Saturday evening, Professor
Wyckoff gave an interesting and
instructive talk to the members
of the Chrestomathian Society,
on the recent coal strike. Prof.
Wyckoff had found it difﬁcult in
his classroom work to obtain sat»
isfactory data on the strike or
1900. So when the present strugr
gle began he determined to visit
the mining region and investigate
the matter for himselft Circum-
stances made it necessary to post-
pone the visit and it was the
middle of August when he ﬁnally
arrived on the ﬁeld. Atthistime
the militia had just been called
out and the great industriallconr
test was in full progress.
l‘rot. Wyckoff gave a very clear
description of the industrial situa-
tion in the mining region, tracing
it back to the introduction of the
foreign element the early
eighties. the study and investi»
gation ot the subject have made
him a hearty believer in the jus-
tice of the miners’ side of the
dispute, as their wages are much
too low to afford them a decent
living.
