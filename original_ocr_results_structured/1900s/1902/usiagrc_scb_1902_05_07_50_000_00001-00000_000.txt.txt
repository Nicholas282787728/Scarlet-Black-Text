THE TRIANGULAR MEET.

Comparative Strength or Drake, Alncs,
and Grinncll as Shown by Records
of the Past Week.

One thing seems certain and
that is that no school is willing to
assert absolutely that it \Vlll win
tlte meet, wlltch will undoubtedly
be close and exciting, 1n the
dashes. Peck of Antes will win if
he is able to run, and this will give
Ames slightly the better chance
or winning the mcct. White of
Antes and Bait and Spaulding of
Grinnell will take tlle otller places.

The quarter lies among Cave
and Tenner of Amos and the
Evans brothers of Grinncll, with
Doll Evans the probable winner,
though the race will be close and
may go to any of the four. The
half is doubtful, as Coates and
Drcc" of “ j , 1353‘. ice
alld Moon: and Doll Evans of
Grinncll all have a chance to will,
The mile is also uncertain, though
Thompson of Drake and Coatcsot
Ames should win over McIlratll
of Grinnell, on account of experi-
ence and longer training.

lti thejumps, most of the points
will go to Drake and Grinncll.
Graham of the Christian College
and Haines will ﬁght for ﬁrst in
in the hrgh, while Brown of Grin-
ncll ought to take the other point.
The hoprstep lies between Graham
of Drake and Fisk of Grinncll. tf
the lattcrcan take part in the meet
with Graham the probable winner.
Pillsbury ot Ames or Spencer of
Grinncll will will the third. The
pole vault will go to Fell of Drake.
with Chapman of Drake second
and King or Grinneiltlrirrl,though
if any of these three are in poor
condition Smith ofAmeswill make
a good bid for a place. as he is do-
ing ten feet. In the broad, Pelt
should win, with second and'third
a close contest between Pillsbury
of Am‘cs and Hair of Grinncll.
Pell‘also seems to be the most
probable winner of all three
weights, with Orcbaugh of Drake
second ahd McClure ofAmcs 3rd
in the discus, HangcroEAmes sec-
ond and Orebaugh third in the
shot, Johnson of Drake second and
jorgenson of Ames third in the
hammer. The bikes should go to

THE WILLET LECTURES.

Monday evening's lecture at the
Congregational church, the ﬁrst of
the series being given by Prof.
willct, was marked by a disagrees
able,drizzlingrnin. Tllisotcourse
had its effect on the ntldiencc,l
which was very small. Ofthose
who did attend, the college peo-
ple predominated. Theattcndance
lztst night was much bctter, the
body of the church being well
ﬁlled. Because of a mistake in
nraking the preliminary announce-
ments, the ﬁrst lccture began at
7:30 o'clock, Last night’s lecture
began at 7, and this is the time set
for the remainder of the series.

The course being given is a
scriesofsludiesin tllelife ofCIlrist.
The subject tor Monday cveping
was “The Gospcl Record.” By
tvay of introduction, the lecturer
spoke of Christ’s central position
in history. A general view was
given of the tour- gospel narratives
iMatthcw, Mark, Luke and john,
with an account oftheir origin and
the manner of their preservation.

resemblances and differences in
style, spirit and contents pointed

terization. the reason for‘tlie ex-
istence of four gospels and how
they appealed to different audi-
cnces was shown.

Last evening’s lecture was on
“Preparations.” Ronle'sinﬁuence

CEDAR RAPIDS MEET.

Sutnmaly of the Dual with COIL—GHTIV
neli won an Easy Victory by a
Large Score.

The track men who went to
Cedar Rapids last Saturday for
tile dual meet with Coc have juS'
tiﬁcd the conﬁdence Grintlcll peo-
ple had placed in them. The
meet was held on a track whose
conditlon was fair alike to both
sides, but not favorable to fast
time. Allard wind blew up the
stretch and the track was soft.
Coo abounds itl good athletic
material but lack ot experience
and proper training counted much
against her. Our team has llntltr
ing but praise for the manner in
which it was received. Meals
were served them in the college
dining hall.

The ﬁnal score as will be en
below was 93% (ll 39%, but in
justice to Coc it must be said that
Groman, the all round winner who
was counted upon to offset the
points won by Bair, was not in
much of the meet, owing to poor
condition. although the fact that
he was not ﬁt to run was not dis-
covered until aftcr he had won
third in the 100 yard clash.

The mile run tvas undoubtedly
the most interesting event from
the spectators‘ standpoint, Mt}
Ilratll, Moore and Ricketls ﬁns
ishcd in order given in the satis
factory time of 4:55. Another
noticeable feature was the win»
nrng of a weight event by a Grills
nell man. Harris took the shot.
One of the best records of the
day was that of the hammer
throw by Currie of Cos. who hurl-
ed the missile 116 ft., 6 in.
