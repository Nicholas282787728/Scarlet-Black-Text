WASHBURN DEBATE.
[Continued ho: Ftrst Page)

ance with the subject, Grinnell’s
greatest weakness seemed to be
lack ot team work and thorough
division of points. and lack of
readiness in rebuttal, Apparent
ly each speaker tried to cover too
much ground and not be quite
sure otwhat his colleagues had
said or were to say. On the ollter
hand the strong points of the
Washburnteamwerethcirdelivcry
and platlornt presencewhich were
better than those of the Grinticll
representatives and their better
division of their side of the ques-
tion. Each man had his part or
the Field and hestuck to it through»
out his speech, and on the whole
made up a well uniﬁed debate.
Asindividuals the Grinncll team
were probably stronger at all
points excepting delivery but on
team work the visitors had the
advantage.

Several things are to belearned
from the result of this debate. In
the ﬁrst place as has been stated
and reiterated, three men cannot
win an intercollegiate debate.
The student body. in spirit, must
be behind the efforts of its repre-
sentativcs.

The attendance at the debate
Wednesday evening should have
been double \vhatit was. Instead
of half a dozen, there should be
twenty men in each society trying
to make the intercollegiate der
hating team. A spirit must be
aroused that will begin the pre-
paration for these debates three
or four years before they take
place. Experience and training
and nothing else will give the
readiness and skill requisite for
success on the rostrum ot debate.
Our debaters must begin in the
academy and work up, This year
a very systematic and thorough
attempt was made to make this

 

debatcavictory. Butthe hardest
work for three months will not
bring what should have been the
product of years of growth. The
spirit otenthusiastic support must
exist. and the college must take
the same warm interest in these
contests that it does in those of
the gridiron or track. Debating
must be made a part or our coir
lege lire it it is to be lolly success
iul.

And now that we have lost one
more debate. it is time to begin
work toward winning the next one.
Let a lull quota of men in the
societies try for the intersociety
debate next [all Make the pres
liminaries enthusiastic contests.
Let every man go in as if it dcr
pended on him to win the victory
for Grinnell in her next debate
with another college. Let each
menlberof acollegc society really
understnnd what responsibility
rests on his individual shoulders,
and let hiln do his duty faithfully.
It the work is doiie in this spirit
for a few years Grinnell will not
have to mourn such a series of
dcieats as she must now look back
upon. it is not the team but the
college that wins or loses debates,
and only the college as a united
whole can bring success in this
line of Work to the scarlet and
black.
