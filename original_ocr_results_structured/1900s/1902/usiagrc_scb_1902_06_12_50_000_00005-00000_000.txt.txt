COMMENCEMENT.

The exercises of the ﬁfty-second
antrual corrrtnencemcnt of Iowa Col-
lege took place this morning in the
Congregational clrrrrclr. The weather
was beautiful and the clrrrrch, deco»
rated in scarlet alrd black atrd in the
scarlet and white of the Seniors, was
crowded with friends of the college,
who have come from all over the
state and country. A number by the
orchestra was followed by prayer and
then Bralrrn's Hungarian Dance was
given by the orchestra.

Professor Josiah Royce, of Har—
vard University, who towers above

all contemporaries irt his chosen line
of work, \rrasirrtr'odttced to the audi-

ence. Professor Royce spoke over an
hour in an address that was one of
the most interesting features of this
commencement. His subject was
“Certain Limitations of the Thought-
ful Public in Amel" a.” Beginning a
consideration of idealism in American
life, Professor Royce deﬁned his use
of the term idcalist, by which he
meant nothing technical, brrt a man,
consciously guided in his life by a pur-
pose which was not entirely that of his
own personal ends. Deﬁning idealism
in'such a way, America is a nation
made tip of idealists. That is, the irr-
fluential men of America, the men
who grride, are those having high
ideals of political and social develop-
ment. It is the most common criti-
cism of foreigners, that Americans
are materialistic, that they airrr as a
nation, only toward the acquirerrrent
of material wealth and are lacking in
the higher aims, And we do have
materialistic tcrrtlerrcies,~tlrey have
conre with our rapid material growth,
they have been a necessary accompar ‘
ment of our rapid expansion in terri-
tory, commerce and inﬂuence, bttt
after all our growth is toward an
idealism. High as rations rule our
leading men, Evils in America are
nrrrnerorrs, as itr the case of our muni~
cipal governments. which are such a
blot on the American name. But
even here idealistic tenderrces are be-
ginning to crop out, Evidetrcies are
seen in rrrarry places that point toward

 

GEORGE I“, MAGOUN, D.

t
agrowth of the idealistic spirit even

amid the corruption of municrpal af-
fairs.

The greatest growth of idealism
among Americans, however, is in the
intellectual world. Broad minded
ideals, though often at ﬁrst rejected,
are ﬁnally received with enthusiasm.
If they have real elements of value
their favorable acceptance by many
thinking men will be inevitable.

New social doctrines which seem to
point to an improvement of social
conditions as they now exist, are taken
up even too quickly. Witness the
wide reading given to Edward
Eellamy's ”Loo/ting Backward." In
religion this sarrre devotion to
idealism may be noticed. No state
church could [rave gained the close re-
latiorrship to state and home and
every day life that has been assumed
by our voluntary forms of worship.

There are weaknesses it) this
tendency toward idealism, It is not a
movement which is perfect. These
same tendencies, that point to high
ideals, often go to extremes in their
excess of zeal for higher things. erd
theories about the ultimate facts of
life are prevalent, and are received by
thoughtful men as well as those who
have lacked the opportunities of cote
lege training Merr become anxious
to find short cuts to great successes,
and receive hastily doctrines, the in~
lrererrt weaknesses of which may
easily be discovered by a little thought-
frrl study, Such excesses are corn-
mon, yet are nearly always partly re-
sultant from a spirit that is good, the
desire for improvement, the devotion
to idealism. Devotion to ideals has
its dangers, which are only too come
nrorr, as its glories,

One of the greatest products of
American idealism is the modern edur
catiorral system, the constant reform
of academic rrretlrods and courses of
shrdy. The movement has furnished

 

D, PRESIDENT l364-ISB4

America a constantly increasing class
of cultivated workers. It has put op—
portrrnities beyond measure within the
reaclr of every industrious citizen.
Everything is done here to develop iii

,the younger generation a still greater

devotion to idealism.

What can be done to make our
idealism nrore intelligent and eﬂective?
The thoughtful public of today is not
as efﬁcacious as it should be. The
thoughtful people are often weak itr
their management of practical affairs.
The enemies to idealism, those who
are not working under the inspiration
of conscious idealism, always know
their purpose, while thelovers of ideal—
ism do not always have a deﬁnite con-
ception of the end toward which they
are working. Yet from east to west
Americans are men of ideals and high
ambitions in social lite, in religion, in
politics and morals. These men with
ends in view are not always as consid~
er ate as possible of means. Great
cities in America are usually models of
ugliness; forests are destroyed and
landscapes ruined, but always as a re-
sult of this ambition to change, to im-
prove. Soorr the church, college, the
school and library spring up.

Our political ideals are the highest
and noblest, yet weakness and rotten-
ness is comrrrorr in American politics.
There are remedies for these lirnita~
tiorrs on the thoughtful public. Unit-
ed actiorr on the part of the thought-
ful men in the application of ideals to
individual life is one remedy, By a
certain temperance in devotion to
ideals, by fostering a spirit of inquiry
and fostering the growth of conserva-
tive idealism, good results willbe gain-
ed. Over arrd above thoughtfulness
and a devotrorr to ideals, there must be
a practical application of ideals. And
this lesson is for all men, the men of
action and the men of study. But
often thorrglrt cannot show us the
happy ideal. In many acts men are

 

prompted by instinct. A wholesome
sentiment may be the saving power
where individual acts cannot be rea-
sotred out. What then is the happy

,medirrm? Shall we stop thinking?

By no means. Have some part of
life reasoned out. Have one region
definitely fornurtated~a region in
which your mind is at home Life is
vast atrd complex, artd in the rest of
it, know as well as you can, where
good leadership directs.
