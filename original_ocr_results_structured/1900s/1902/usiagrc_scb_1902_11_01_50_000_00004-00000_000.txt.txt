ADDRESS OF PRESIDENT DAY.

Thursday evening at the chapel
President Day of Andover Theor
logical Seminary addressed the
two Christian Associations on The
Christian Ministry as a Profession.
President Day showed how the
ministry is a great power at all
times. Itistheprofcssioninwhicll
men are reached on their noblest
side, the side of religion. There
is no busmess in which men have
more inﬂuence or can do more
towards serving the world and
shaping the thought and ideals of
men.

For this great work the candir
date must be thoroughly prepared,
No man can go into a profes»
sion which touches the dc e pe st
thoughts and ideals of men, and
do the work that must be done
without the most thorough train
ing. This trainingin the ministry
must include not only the study
and close thought concerning men
in society and concerning men as
religious beings. but also the train-
ing for the development in power
of presentation of the noble ideals
witll ivhich the minister deals.
This profession should only be
entered from zealand love for men
and for the work. Not the hard
ships nor pecuniary results should
be considered. but the work that
may be done and the results that
may be won. Men should recog
nize the splendid opportunities
that are before them and should
entertlie ministry from this point

of view,
