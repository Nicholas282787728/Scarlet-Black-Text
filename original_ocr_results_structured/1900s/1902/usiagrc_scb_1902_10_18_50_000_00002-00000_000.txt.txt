Grinnell, Iowa, Saturday, Oct. ts, rgc:

(libtttthal

OME complaint has been
g heard from members of
the women’s tennis association
that the men are not very careful
about trespassing on the women's
courts, While itis to be regretted
that the new courts are not in
.shape ior use, the men should
avoid using those of the women,
especially during the regular

recreation hours.

FTEN the theory of arbitra-
tion, voluntary and com-
pulsory. is debated in colleges, and
the principleas atheory is familiar
to all students; but rarely does a
more striking example of its use
occur than in the settlement of
the present coal strike. The
same plan, adopted at ﬁrst, might
have saved the two hundred
million dollar loss which the strike
has caused, but it seems as if
nothing but hard experience. with
actual suffering, will teach the

lesson,

AT seems as it a hoodoo has
struck the team this fall,
To play heavier teams has always
been Grinnell‘s part but this year
it seems as if the team must ale
ways play under conditions where
weight will inevitably be a very
important tactor in deciding the
game. To-day tor the third
time of the season the game must
be played on a heavy ﬁeld though
the grassy gridiron at Ames will
be better than mud. At present
the only thing to do seems to be
to play the hardest game possible
and hope for a better field next

time

attending from the northeastern
part of the state. Two members
of our faculty made addresses be-
fore the association. President
Bradley delivered a very interest.

ident Bradley will speak before
the Southwestern Iowa Teachers'
Association which is to meet at

AMES ls AROUSED.

If the student body is as full of
spirit as the 51mm, Ames has ex-
perienced a reVlval long needed.
A meeting of the Independent
Order of Chronic Rooters was
held Thursday and mass a meeting
Friday evening. The following
appears in Wednesday‘s 517111011:

The game Saturday will be the
last game on the Ames ﬁeld this
yeari Much interest centers in
the game because it is a meeting
of the two old rivals, In the his-
tory of the football struggles be-
tween the two institutions Grin-
nell's victories constitute almost a
case of history repeating itself,
Ames not having won their Grin-
nell game since '95, when our
score against the scarlet and black
was decisivei

Ifthe day is at all favorable.
the crowd that will witness the
game will beoiic of the largest
ever seen on our ﬁeld. and ii pre-
parations count for anything, the
rooting will be the best since the
Grinnell game of '99
