.TAYLO s ADDRESS.

Interesting Services on the Day or Prayer
istcreopricon Lecture on social
Seltlt‘menr Work.

_The day observed by Grinnell
as the day of prayer for colleges
has come and gone. and the stu-
dents have had another opportun-
ity to hear a man who is doing a
great work in a quiet but effective
way. The great majmity ot the
students used this opportunity;
some of them did not, and so
missed the inspiration and help-
fulness of the addresses by Dr.
Graham Tayloi, who was the guest
of the college for this occasion.
This is the third time that Dr.
Taylor has been in Grinnell for
the day of prayer, and during this
last visit. as on the two former, he
delivered addresses of eloquence
and power and added to the high
'csieem with which he is regarded.
Dr. Taylor is well ﬁtted to speak
to students on an occasion of this
kind. He is in touch with academ-
ic lite, and is thoroughly in sym-
pathy with students, but his sym-
pathy is not conﬁned to his semin-
ary Work, and therein lies his
power. He appreciates the debt
which college men and women
owe to the less fortunate, and by
his workin the Chicago Commons
is endeavoring to remove some of
the unjust inequalities that exist.
He has a strong personality; is of
pleasing address, eloquent and
scholarly. The ideal he set before
the students is high, but not too
high for his own life, nor too high
torpracticai application by sincere
men and women.

Dr. Taylor gave four addresses
on Sunday and a short talk at the
chapel hour Monday morning. and
in addition to these, held several
conferences with individual stur
dents during his visit. The ﬁrst
service was held in the chapel at
ten o'clock Sunday morning. The
theme of Dr. Taylor’s address
was "Possession ot Purpose.” and
was suggested by the passage in
Luke which relates the incident
which occurred between jesus and
his mother when He was found
questioning the doctors in the
temple. This was the most formal

addressofthe day and wasastrong
appeal to his hearers.

The men’s meeting at four
o‘clock was an intormal onei

Clean, Hard Game with our Baptist
Brethrencharlet and Black Scores
its First Victory.

Alter a tcdioiisjourney last Sate
llrday, long in hours but rather
short in miles. Captain McKeag
lined up his team oi basket ball
players agai at a similar aggrega-
tion [tom the Central University
with the result given above, The
game was wholly iree lrom bad
feeling and the boys speak in
glowing terms of the manner in
which they were entertained.

The game was a good one.
Much of the credit for the victory
is due to Fillmore and Cole. The
latter's man was an exceptionally
strong player but was not left un»
guarded an instant. Both teams
relied wholly on team work but
our boys were somewhat superior
in this respect. ltisa noteworthy
fact that our team did not have
the support of a single router and
there is hope in this [or us. Iowa
will be here next Saturday and
we cannot expect her to be any»
thing but strong, but we can meet
her with stronger and better play
than we exhibited at Fella if only
the galleries can be ﬁlled with
Grinnell enthusiasm, Our team
remembers the defeat of last fall
and will do its best to balance the
account. Tliestudetits,tacultyand
townspeople can do their share by
paying their quarters and giving
the teams the‘encouragement of
their presence. Let everybody go
and yell, and win.

Following is the lineup of last
Saturday'sgame. The same Grin-
nell team will be played against

N Ew DEBATING SYSTEM.

gress. According to the system
a second team consisting oi three
men will be chosen to give the
ﬁrst team opposition. Mr. C. R.
Barnard will lead the second team
but his twocolieagues are yet to

Robert Haines. Jr. has been se-
cured to coach the scrubs insures
them the best or coaching and
they will no doubt give the ’Var-
sity strong opposition. Several

CYRANO DE EERGERAC.

All things considcred, it has
seemed best to choose “Cyrano de
Bergerac" In pi-eierence to“L’Aig-
Ion." as the play 1.. the interpre»
intion of which Mrs. Bertha Kunz
Baker \Vlll be heard Friday even-
ing. Both are works of Edmond
Rostand ranking among the best
of dramatic productions. “Cyra-
no de Bergerac” is probably the
more brilliant of the two and is
also the better known in this vi-
cinity. Of its subjectrniatter and
the wonderful success it has met
with, nothing new can be said. In
presenting this brilliant drama
Mrs. Baker has scored the great
est success from New York to
Colorado, returning in some in~
stances for as many as ﬁve repeti-
tions“) 'st lingtiiet’uctthat
in the same city there had been a
prolonged season of the drama as
a stage production. The wonder»
ful ability of Mrs. Baker displayed
in the presentation of this highly
successiul drama will give an ev—
ening ot unalloyed pleasure to
those-assembling to hear it.
