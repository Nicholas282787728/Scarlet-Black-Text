RABBI HIRSCH SPEAKS AT
COLLEGE

Addresses Major Political Science Class
on the jews as Contributors

to Politics.

Besides being tavored by the
chapel talk Wednesday morning,
the students of Professor Macy’s
major political class were given the
privilege of hearing Rabbi Hirsch
speak for an hour on the contribu-
tions ofthe Hebrews tothe sciencc
of politics.

The jews have contributed to
the science of governmcnt no
speculative writings such as those
of Plato or Aristotle, The literar
ture of Hebrew history is found in
the Old Testament, and there we
learn that the jewish government
was a Theocracy. a government
where religious and civil govern-
ment were one, and all ruled, as
they believed, by God. Theearly
jews were organized as clans and
as subrclans or families. The bond
of the clan was blood relationship,
descent from a common ancestor.
Naturalization or entrance into
the tribe or clan was by the blood
covenant in which the blood of the
applicant was actually exchanged
for the blood of some member of
the clan. The men spoken of in
the Bible asjudges were elders, or
the oldest men in the tribe, asin
the Arabian desert the sheik or
old man is the chief, When the
shofet or elder was incompetent
or physically unable to attend to
his duties, the priests aided in apr
pointing another, These elders,
or shofets, or judges were of far
more importance as military lead-
ers and political organizers than as
judicial othcers.

At the time oi the judges there
was no llebrew nation but only a
number of clans or tribes. This
was followed by a monarchy on
the modcloftheAsinticdespotism.
The choice oi king fully shows the
power of the theocracy. Saul was
chosen by the people on account
of his physical attributes and was
conﬁrmed by Samuel, the reprer
sentativeofthepriesihood, Later
David was chosen in the same
way. In later years the kingdom
was divided and there are evi-
dcnces of a struggle between the
kings and the representatives of
the theocracy, The kings aimed

at the establishment of a despotic
monarchy the prophets
struggled to maintain the state and
religiousorganizationsasone. The
theocracy recognized the rights of
the weak and poor and tletended
them, Slavery was almost absOr
lutely prohibited and this. the
limitation of slavery, is the ﬁrst
contribution of the Hebrews to
political science. Their second
contribution was the restriction of
absolute ownership of land. The
land or the Jews they believed to
be given them by God, and hence
they could not sell it in perpetuity
but only for ﬁfty years. But the
most signal contribution was the
recognition of the individual, alr
most in the modern sense.
Crimes were to be judged by the
state and the right ot blood re
venge was donc away with, The
weak were protected and every
man's crime was to be tried by
the state, and he was not to be
subject to blood revenge until so
tried. This is the meaning of the
lex talionis, the law of an "eye
for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.”
It did not mean literally a “tooth
for a tooth” but that just pay
should be made for an offense.
Cities of asylum were provided
for innocent offenders and much
was done that showed the begin
ning of the modern idea of the
individual as above all.

SATURDAY, NOVEMBER I.

LECTURE 0F RABBI HIRSCH,

The ﬁrst number of the lecture
course ivasgiven Wednesday even-
ing in the Congregational church
by Dr. Emil G, Hirsch of Chicago
the subject,
Education,

on Libraries and

This subject was
chosen for the beneﬁt of the large
number or visiting librarians, but
it also proved very beneﬁcial to
the college and town people. in
opening their eyes to the import-
ant functions of libraries.

The librarian is more than a
collector and cataloguer of books.
He is an educator whose purpose
is just the same as the college
professor's and as such deserves

the sympathy and co-opcration of
all.

Mr, IIirsch's deﬁnition of edur

cation demands that it make a
man feel himself at home in the

world. Thepresentdaytendency

towards technical education will
make him a machine, ﬁnally a
mere automaton, and it is the duty
of the library to present to this
technically educated man, an op-
portunity for him to broaden out.
Its shelves should contain en-
lightenment ml the constitution
and life of nature, and it is fast
reaching a position when it willbe
able to place before the busy man
such works in the most convenient
way.

One at the most important
iunctions of the library is to imr
press a man with his own powers.
Man is not merely a creation but
is a creator. He must absorb a
consciousness of his ability
through wide reading, and the
librarian should help to choose
the books which will be most belle»
Flciztl. The noblest study of man
is man. The library also has in
its power to alleviate the social
strife to a certain extent, Men
should rise above petty racial,
social, and class differences, and
to do this they must know the
causcstor misunderstanding, since
to know all insures pardon tor all.
The ﬁction which is'mere gossip
should be left to the newspaper.
Other ﬁction has it legitimate and
very beneﬁcial uses.
