THE SIMPSON GAME.

On Friday the football team
goes to lndianola, where they
play Simpson.

Simpson has practically all or
her old men in the game this year.
and under the efﬁcient training at
coach Reid. they have developed
into a ﬁrst class team. Iowa de-
teated them by the low score or
lo to o, and last Saturday they
defeated Drake by a score of 6 to
5.

Simpson has tor several years
been trying to gain recognition
from the Big Four, and it looks as
though she would accomplish her
object thisseason withoutleﬁculty
Our team willbeseriously handi-
capped by the absence or D.
Smith and Welker, who were in-
jured in the Minnesota game and
who will not be able to play Fri-
day.

Simpson has never deteateil
Grinnell although last ycar they
were very. conﬁdent of doing the
trick but were painrully surprised
at the outcome. They again en-
joy that same conﬁdence which
we hope will be shattered again.

Our team has played against
odds all through the season so
it is only by the greatest effort or
both team and students. that we
can regain our position in the
front ranks.

A low rate of one fort: and and
tllird has been obtaincd and if a
large number go it will be reduced
to one tare tor round trip.

The team needs and deserves
support, and students can Show
their loyalty in no better way than
by going to Indianola and cheer-
ing for old Grinnell to the very
last.

MONTEZUMA DEFEATS SCRUBS m
A CLOSE GAME—THE SCORE
BEING 5-ot

Saturday the Iowa College sec-
ond team played the Montezuma
high school on the latter's grounds
at Montezuma. The second team
were handicapped in that the
'Varsity'took several second team
men to Minneapolis as subs. mak~
ing it necessary to play men in
positions that were entirely new
to them, thus to alargc extent ac»
counting tor the rumbles which
lestthe game tor Grinnell.

Montezuma made their gains by

 

wide and runs, making their only

 

touchdown on on: just after the
kickoff in the second half, when
they procured the ball on a fumble.
With this exccptlon the game was
played in the opponents' territory.

Montezumaiscoached by James
McKeag, '02. a former member of
the Iowa College 'Varsity. and ht:
has succeeded with fair material
in making a team that plays con-
sistent football.

These second team games are
no doubt at more importance than
atrirst appears in that some of
next year's 'Varsity must come
tram this years second team and
the experience ota tewgames is
very valuable.

oRtNNELLvs. WEST DES MOINES,

Saturday at Des Moines. Grin»
nelland West Des Moines played
one of the best high schoolgames
that has been played this season,
the score being 6 to o. The
game was a ﬁerce andclosely con-
tested one front start to ﬁnish and
showed abetter quality of fools
hall than most college games,
West Des Moines played a very
rast, snappy game and while
Grinnell also played a great game
the team can play better. Jensen,
the West Des Moines quarter,
played a star game till he was
obliged to leave the team, and
Reynolds, another Des Moines
man, was also a star. For Grins
nell every man played good ball
in the last half, though in the
ﬁrst part of the game there was a
tendency to let the man who was
carrying the ball do all the work.
The teature of the game, it there
was any part deserving that name
rather than another. was when
West Des Moines held Grinnell
for downs on the three yard line
Gilley made a couple of twenty
yard end runs. Des Moines'
touchdown was made in the ﬁrst
half on a fumbled punt while
Grinnell scored in the second by

straight hard foot-ball.
