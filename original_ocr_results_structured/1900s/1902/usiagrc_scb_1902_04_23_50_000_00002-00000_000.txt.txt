arrow; the many innovations

taking place this year is
that of requiring the Juniors to
pay admission to the Senior play.
In the days when the plays iveie
given in the Rand gymnasium
where a stage had to be erected
and all the seats carried over liom
chapel, the complimentary tickets
given the Junior; were more than

earned by them. With advent the
of the Colonial thelaborof prepai-

ing a theatre is clone away with.
Nevertheless, the courtesy QX'
tended the Juniors in the post
would very gladly be continued
by the Seniors, did not ﬁnancial
considerations prompttlieinother-
wise. Amateur theatricals when
properly presented are expensive,
Much more so is tllls true of a
play like “Midsummer Night's
Dream" which gives such unlimit-
ed opportunity tor scenic display.
The propel'staging ofthe play will
require a heavy ﬁnancial outlay.
Taking these (acts into considera-
tion it seemed best to discontinue
the issuing of complimentary
tickets entirely this year and not
only will the juniors be affected
by the change, but those members
of the Senior class who do not
talre part in the class play will be
required to pay admission

with the 16 pound shot. Dul‘liig

‘Tuesday several conrerences were

the Sophomores to contest again

this event was thrown out allo-
getlier. This leaves the result of
the meet a tie by a score of 6i%
to 61%. The dispute over this
event arose out of the disappear-
ance or the to pound shot about a
week previous to the time ot the
meet. Whetherthisdisappeamnce
can be attributed to either class

When it was found that the i2
pouiid shot was the only weight in
Grinnell, the captains of botli class
teams agreed to contest this event
using that weight, but the Fresh-
men were dissatisﬁed with tllc re-
sultand decided to enter a protest.
Accoiding to the rules of the state
association which governed the
meet. the shot must weigh to
pounds. and on this ground the
Freshmen protested. Tho soph-
omore classclaimedthe agieenient
between the captains was binding
and as a consequence refused to
consider another trial. Because
ot the inability of the classes to
agree on this point. the shot put

SECOND LEWIS-ATHENS DEBATE.

The second annual debate be-
tween the Athens society or Form
college Academy and the Lewis
society or Grinnell will take
place in the chapel some time
next month. The date has not
been deﬁnitely settled as yet. ll
the facultyconsents it will be held
May twenty-ﬁrst. The question
is in regard to the exclusion of
the Chinese from this country.
Gi-innell upholds and Penn
opposes this proposiiton, The
debaters forthe Lewis society are
McIIrath’oﬁ. Raley '06 and Tile
ten ’07. Mcllrath was on the
team which defeated the Grinnell
high school two years ago. and
also the one that beat Penn last
year. Tillon and :Raley have both
had considerable experience in
society work.

The history of academy debat-
ing presents a pleasing contrast
to the college record; the former
has an unbroken string of Victor
ies to its credit. Another evis
dence or the value of the training
the academy society gives its
members is the fact that every
man on the present college team
received his ﬁrst training in the
Lewis society.
