THE PURPOSE OF THE BOARD OF
ATHLETIC CONTROL.

Foratiumber or years many alumni
and students. as well, have telt the need
ot relorm in the management etallilctics
in Iowa College. Necessarily with tlte
system ot student managers iti rogue it
otten happened that an inemiient man
would be chosen manager. and in conse
quence ﬁnancial troubles resulted. Fur
ten years there has almost con tly
been a debt weighing douwthe AlMt‘tlc
Union. with constant struggles to avoid
gettingtn deeper. An occasional q‘IESr
tion in intercollegiate relations has otten
been unwisely settled.

These conditions prompted some tit the
alumni who were interested in athletics
to look tor a remedy. The system ot
alumnicontrol adrni stored by .t board
chosen by the alumni appealed to them
as the best sclteme. Accordingly two
yPats ago the matter was placed in the
hands ot a committee at our Chicago
alumni, consisting of Mr. F, w. Darling.
'95, Mr. I. F. Darby. '95. Mr F. M sar.
gem. lo, and ltlr. c, E Harris. on,

This committee drew up a constitution
and outlined a scheme by which athletics
in Grinnell tvere to be controlled bya
board, to consist of three alumni and one
member each item the Faculty and Ath.
letic Union. The scheme was approved
by the Faculty and adopted by the Athr
letic Union, This constittttton has been
sent to each graduate ot Grinncll,so that
all are probably tamihar with the worlee
ing details.

The board within the short time it ltas
been in existence has only begun to ten
arrange conditions and policies. There
has,oicourse. been a number of questions
as to the limits ot authority. but in gen.
eral the Athletic Union. Faculty and
Board have worlted together Vcryhnrs
muniously. By gradually establishing
changed customs and traditions in‘athletr
ic policy.it is hoped that a mttch improved
athletic status may result in later years.

What the scheme needs istlte cams
plete support (moral and ﬁnancial) of
alumni and students. Every alumnus
has been solicited to bccoinen member,
that Grinnell may be placed in a position
to maintainherpresent system otathletlc
development.

Some replies to these requests to the
alumni have denoted a misunderstanding
of the purpose of the alumni board in
supporting athletics. The ultimate pure
pose is not to will games. not to set Grlne
nell on a lotty pedestal among Western
schools. These are strong incentives
that help much to accomplish the real
purpose, which is to give Grinnell stue
dents systematic and scientiﬁc athletic
exercise properly controlled so that our
graduates may not be deterred by a weak
'physique froma tull realization oi the
possibilities which we all know Grinnell

To give the students this systematic

ATHLETIC BEGINNINGS IN IOWA
COLLEGE.

During the civil tvar, I do not ltnttw that
anything was done that can be classiﬁed
among things athletic. The men were ttw,
and those tew tottiid adequate physical
tralrtitig iii worlctrittheir way in college.

Among the earliest games to be intros
duccd was that ot toutball, which was
neither Rugby nor Association. I had
learned the game train a school teacher
who was a student at Earltiani College.
lndiana. This game was played by the
whole school. A rotitid ball was used.
and it was contrary lo the rules ot the
game to touch the ball with the hands. ex-
cept when it was thrown into the field alter
it had been klckcd out at hounds. In such
a case one might catch it and kick it Item
the hands it he could it was also contrary
to rule to use the hands and aims in inter
teiing with a player. The orthodox way to
interleie was to run over the player. or to
shove hiin over by a hip thiust. The score
was made by kicking the ball across a line.
lt was strictly a winter game. being too v
lent to be played in watnt weather. This
game was introduced about the year 1855
or ’66. and was continued lor many years.

[lite ot the first students to talre a direct
interest in physical culture was 5
Noah Cooper. ot the class at lo7. Ht’ tetl
a little tiind atid erected a stviiig among t‘”
locttst trees west ot Alumni Hall. He r is a
positive advocate at regular physical trains
ing. and was iii many ways a prophesy oi
the contiiig athletic enthusiast. Another
earnest enthusiast in the same line was Mah'
lan willett of the class 01’69. Hecontract»
ed a very uticomtortable habit ot risinx
earlyiii the morning and taking a brisk
walk or a ruti into the country before break-
iast. By downright persistancc. he sucr
ceeded iii iiidticiiig a score oi other boys
to join litiii in these early perantbulations.

Baseball was introduced about 1867.
There were then a tetv students in the col-
lege who in modern days would have been
heroes, Michael Austin was a soldier
186l and uiittl 1864, and then he was a stu-
tleiit in Iowa College trcni 1866 to 1371.
he was such an athlete as would have re-
joiced the heart ot the modern trainer. he
was the organizer or prominently associat-
ed with the ﬁrst baseball team. At the
same time there \vere“Big"0wcll and “Litr
Ile" Owen and Ed. Payne. who der mod-
ern conditions would have been distinguish-
ed. ltliitiktlielirst match game with an
outside team was played oit ground south
ol Alumni Hathabout the year 1553, In
this game. ittistiti atid Payne and the twins
were stars. and the home team was [I’iult‘r

For a long time, athletic sports were :n»
tirely in the hands ot the students, College
authorities took no aecottiit at them,
