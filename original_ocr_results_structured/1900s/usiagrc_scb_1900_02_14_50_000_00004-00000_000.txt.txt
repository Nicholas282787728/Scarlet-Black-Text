a Clcdit to themselves and to tile
society

Mr, Quaite again sustained his
reputation which he had won in
the previous contest, by again
making tile star speech of the
evening and getting ﬁrst place on

given since he has been in the so-
ciely, Mr, Hamlin, who rebiitted
for the negative, spoke well and
covered a large number ol points
in a short time.

The question tor debate was the
same as Will be used in the inter-
society debate. namely, Resolved:
“That the claims of Great Britain
in the controversy with the South
Atrican Republic, prior tolanuary
l, lgoo, are justiﬁable." Tile af-
ﬁrmative was supported by J. A.
Meade, Qtlaiie and McCarty, and
the negative by Hamlin,’ Dic ins
son and Jones. Eaehspealrer was
allowed twelve minutes and each
side ﬁve minutes for rebuttal. The
program was opened with a vocal
solo by Miss Couitney,acconipan.
led by Miss Nellie Boddy. The
two selections. “I Love,“ by Be-
atrice Hinds, and “Goodrby. Sweet
Day,” by Vannah, were rendered.

Mead-e then opened the debate
for the afﬁrmative by saying that
the afﬁrmative would admit that
England had made mistakes. The
gieater part of his speech was der
voted to the history of thequestinn
as seen trom the English stand
point. Mr. Hamlin, who opened
the debate for the negative, began
by stating the points which the

i
nntl speaker for the itﬁ‘iiintttivc

 

negative would prove, lle dwelt
for a considerable tinie upon the
treaties between England and the
noeis, Mr Qiinitc was the sec

His speech was well pi-rpnietl niidi

Dickinson, tool: two points which
he attempted to prove, Ile qttots
ed from International Law that
was favorable lo the Boers, and
computed their lath‘ to these or
the Unitetl States. The speech of
Mr McCitIly, the last speiiltei tor
the afﬁrmative, consisted mostly

of quotations from International) .

Law. and applying them to the’
question. Mr. Jones, itho closed
the debate tni the negative, tool:
up the moral side at the question,
saying that England was in the
\vlungin liei-encroaelnnentson the
Beets. Hamlin iebtitletl [or the
negative and Qtinite tor the amm-
ativc. While waiting for the de»
cision or the judges, Mi, Edsnn, at
the request ofthepresident, spoke
a tew words, which were much ap-
pieciated by the society. The dc-
cision of the St)Clt:ly on the debate
wasﬁtell votes for the afﬁrmative,
and six for the negative. Mls.
