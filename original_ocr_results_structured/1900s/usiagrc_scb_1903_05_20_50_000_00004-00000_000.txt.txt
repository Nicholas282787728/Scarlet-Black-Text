ATHENAgLEWIS DEBATE AT
OSKALOOSA.

The Athena Literary society ot
Penn College Academy and the

Lewis Literary society of the

GrinnellAcademy met last Fri-
day evening in their third annual

debating contest. About twenty-

ﬁve students together with two of
the teachers. Miss Spencer and
Principal Horn, accompanied the
team and enjoyed a trip made es-
pecially delightful by the hue
weather,

The subject tor debate was,7
Resolved, that the Unltcd States
should retain permanent posses
sion ot the Philippine Islands.
The resolution was affirmed by
Penn and denied by Grinnell.

The discussion was opcncd by
Austin Lewis of Penn who ably
represented his school, speaking
with a good degree oi lorce and
clearness. He argued that the
Philippines had been legally ob»
taincd by the three-fold process
of war, purchase and treaty. That
they were ours, and should be
treated as all other previously ac»
quired territory.

The second speaker onthe at-
ﬁrmative, Roscoe Woodard, pre»
sented the progress made by the
Islands under our government,
and argued that their greatest
possible peace and u-cltare would
be promoted by their permancnl
retention by us.

Burton Hadley the third
speaker for the afﬁrmative. He
gave avery tine exposition ot the
great natural resources and possir
ble wealth ot the Islands, and
urged that tor ﬁnancial reasons
we could not attord to give them
up. He also argued that they
otter-ed a means tor a great ex-
pansion ot our commerce in the
East, and that they must be
retained by us- in order to prevent

The third speaker on the nega
tive, H.I.Worth, puttorth strongly
the moral right otthe Philippines
to look forward to ultimate inde-
pendence. To deny this right is
to repudiate our own principles,
and would require us to adopt a
colonial policy, which would be
detrimental to our government,

All of the speakers deselve the
