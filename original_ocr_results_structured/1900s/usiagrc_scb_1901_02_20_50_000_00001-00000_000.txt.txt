PRES.

Senior Preps Successfully En-
tertain Themselves.

In response to the unique little
yellow and red invitations which
were passed drscr-iniinately around
the campus early last week, about
forty senior preps assembled in
Institute Hall last Saturday even-
ing for the ﬁrst ’05 paity ot the
20th century. As requested by
the invitations, nearly all present
were in costume. Almost any age,
sex or condition of sei vitude, from
the miller's roustabout the
queen of farries could be tound
represented there. The hall was
decorated with plants and palms
in a way that proved the social
committee to be willing workers
as well as tacilul entertainers. The
main feature of the evening’s pro
gramme was a carnival or indoor
sports consisting of various sorts
of appropriate contests Huge tin
medals were awarded to the vicr
tors in these events and they were
worn with a pardonable pride dur
ing the last short hour of the
evening. A tcw vocal and zobo
numbers lent interest and variety
to the occasion.

When the time for refreshments
came, partners iound each other
by matching the ragged edges of
the valentines which had been dis
tributed among the guests. Each
person present was provided with
a wide shingle and presently an
efﬁcient corps of waiters covered
these with a dainty repast ot icc
cream, coffee and cake, while a
“choir invisible" kept the air full
of music.

The departure of the chaper
ones, Prof. DEIVlSJKI'lcl Miss l'Iaines,
was the signal tor dispersion and
at eleven o'clock the company
reluctantly disbancl€(l,aiter voting
the adarr an unqualiﬁed success.

Norris was appealed to, with the
result that he willingly contribute
ed his services. The lecttlre was
so well appreciated that the re
ccipts were sufﬁcient to clear
away the deﬁcit and leave a bal—
ance of 515 on hand in the treas-
tiry with which the boys can meet
their spring athletic expenses.
