CHAPEL TALK.

Protessor Horn spoke a few words
at Chapel Monday morningon the pur-
pose of the Grinnell Academy. The
object of the Academy is twofold.
First, to furnish a. convenient pre-
paratory school for college students
who have deﬁciencies and “have to
Lake dutch.” Secondly, the Academy
is especially adapted for ,man who
have. fallen behind in their educa»
tlunal life and at the age 01 twenty or
twentyrﬁve years are just ready to
enter High School. Such men can
hardly look forward to a full college
course and the Academy aims to
furnish them a substitute for college
and give them an educational train»
ing that. will ﬁt them for life.

_..__.

The Association rooms were the
scene of 2: unique social function Sat~
urdny alternoon when the ladies of.
the faculty circle kept open house and
served Deli. and wafers to their friends.
The object was to bring the faculty,
town people and soudsnrs together
fora social chat over the tan cups,
but unlortunatelytlle students were
conspicuous by their absence. The
few students who where there surely
received a royal welcome sud enjoyed
tothe fullest extant the genial hos~
pltality of the iaculty ladies. It is
hoped that the ladies will again keup
open house in the near future and
that more of the student body will
avail themselves of this privilege Oi
mingling in a. social way with the

 

faculty and town people.
