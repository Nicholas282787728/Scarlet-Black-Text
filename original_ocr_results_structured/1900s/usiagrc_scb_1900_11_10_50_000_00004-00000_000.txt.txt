On account of the numerous

endeavored to devise a system
whicll may be equitable to all
parties, by eliminating all or the

Numbers for choice of scab: may

before numbers can be drawn. the
number of seats dcsircd must be

College Announcement 186076I.

The announcement of Iowa Colv
lcgc for 1860—61, which has both
framed and recently placed in the
library, suggests quite a contrast
between the college of tllat time
and the college as it is today.
From a single page the catalogue
has grown so that now 135 'pagcs
are required. Forty years ago the
faculty was composed of three
professors, now it has 33 instl‘ucr
tors, besides r4 other ofﬁcers.

The college is tortunate in still
having with it the principal ot the
school at that time. Then the
college was divided into three
terms of thirteen wcclts each. A
long vacation was had between
the tall and winter terms which
permitted the students to teach
during the winter season without

 

dropping out oi college wot it.
Tuition was from four to (we dole
lars per term board ranged
trout Sr.5o to St 75 in private Inmr
ilies. The curriculum elilbl‘I‘tC'
eel from eight to twelve studies,
being varied according to demand.
iowa college has certainty made
stcatly and continued gains in all
lines.

which was much appreciated, and
at the close of the program Miss

The stage was tastefully are
ranged to represent a small parlor
with a tea table etc., and was light
ed by candles which gave a sotr
effect to the whole scene,

The acting was certainly up to
the average of such pertolrnances
and in some particulars was better
than usual. Tire long soliloquies
were more than ordinarily hard,
but the girls succccdcd remarkr
ably well in keeping up
natutalncss and spontaneity of
their parts, The climax, too, was

well brought out where they den
ctded to send a note to the terri-
ble Will Shakespeare to warn
him not to write any such dread.
