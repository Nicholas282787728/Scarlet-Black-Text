CHAPEL TALKS 0F MELVILLE
DEWEY.

crivcn Thursday and Friday Morning on
Library Wclk.

In his essay on “The American
Scholar" Emerson lays emphasis
on the integrlty Ofman apart from
his chance occupation, So. tor
example, a man should not be a
farmer but a one who farms. Mr.
Dewey is notalibrarian, buta man
who uses books.

No digest of his two addressesI
given to the college on Thursday
and Friday morningscan be made,
tor both addresses were packed
so full of condensed and valuable
content that theythemselves were
digests of a noble life and of a
great life work, But the funda-
mental principles oi Mr. Dewey's
life philosophy can be outlined.

“All of us, who have commencr
ed to live, especially in this new
era of the twentieth century, it we
actually live in harmony with the
spirit of our time, are ﬁlled with
the ever newspirit of social service,
with the Christian spirit of helping
our brothers. in this way alone
can we ﬁnd the best value in life,
can we grow.—can we become
'worthily happy."

(“We must meet the economical
situations, aid the physical welfare
of our fellows, stimulate lh eir
mental progress, their moral and
spiritual growth or contribute to-
ward thc solution of the social
problem which we now face and
with which we must grapple in the
near future, if we would serve our
brother. Each profession meets
the demands of some one or more
departments and demands strong
men of good earnest purpose. But
the one protession offering the
most directopportunity otserving
men in all departments is that
which uses as its tools the most
potentofcharacterbuilders,books.

enceiall are requisite tor the
man who will serve his tellows tlirli
books. Such men are needed.
Such men can ﬁnd all they seek,
unlimited opportunity to serve, in
publiclibrarywork." .
THE CHORAL SERVXCE.
Vespers tomorrow will be in
the hands of the choir, and will
inaugurate a monthly choral sen
vice which will be maintained
throughout the year. The main
purpose ot these services is to give
an opportunity for the hearing of
such church music as is beyond
the scope of the regular scrvicc,
and to make us acquainted with

the best work of the devout com
posers of all ages. The service
tomorrow will consist of the
ancient Choral Evensong, ar-
ranged by Thomas Tallis in the
sixteenth century irom the still
earlier version of John Merbecke,
whose work was based on the
Roman chants usedin England be
fore the Reformation, The music
to be sung to~morrow is tor the
greater part many centuries old,
and is full of signiﬁcance, historic
cally as well as spiritually.

In addition to the service
proper, Bunnelt's Magniﬁcat and
Nunc Dimittis in F, and the Kyrie
Eleison from Gounod’s Messe
Solennelle will be sung.
