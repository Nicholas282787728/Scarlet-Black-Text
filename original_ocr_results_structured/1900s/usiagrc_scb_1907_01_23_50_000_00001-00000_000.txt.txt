COE MEETS A “.24 DEFEAT.

People irom Cedar Rapids Unable to
Win from rhe Wearers oi the
Scarler and Black.

With nearly twice as many scores
on their Own side 01 the board as the
Presbyterians could muster the Grin-
nell basket ball ﬁve sent the 005
people back to their city with a. sense
Dillaving bucked up against a real
team. It was an honorable defeat,
however, for both Learns played reol
ball all the time. The gallery sent, the
Cue oinciel away with an impression
of the sublimely inconsiderate “prep
ishness” which is more appropriate at
adog ﬁght than in a college athletic
contest. Any contempt he may have
for such an exhibition of vile mariners
is entirely justiﬁed.

Coe started oi? with a dash and held
a good pace throughout the game
A little more speed in passing and
additional practice at basket throw-
ing would have increased their score
to some extent. Their ability to get
in front. of the ball often prevented
the opposing side irom adding to
theirs. Aston's Work was of good
quality.

For Griunell every man played the
game. Both forwardsfcund the basket
repeatedly and McIlrath‘s two goals
from the center of the ﬁeld seemed to
be the result of more than luck. The
learn Work rather went by spurts and
the tendency r o long passes netted
little gain. N0 substitutes were used
by either side.

Owing to the weather not as large
an attendance was experienced as
should find its way into these games.
The Iowa College band showed its
good inrentious by being present in
goodly numbersand iurnisliing ashoit
program before each half.

A STATEMENT.

Sumers and Fisher Speak of a Mailer
which Needs Comment,
There is a. word which it seems to

us should be said at this time with

regard to the attitude of students to-
ward visiting nthletic teams. It is
not entirely nworil of adverse criti»
cism iorit is a noticeable fact that
the good work of our opponents often
receives hearty applause from the
spectators as it indeed sllould. On
the other hand should the rough work
of an opponent be open to more severe
criticism than the ioul playing of one
of our men? The case seems to be
that roughness by a member of 3. visits
ing team is met with ieers and hisses
while the same style of play by e
Grinuoll player is simply laughed at.
This attitude is entirely wrong The
members of visiting teams are probabe
1y gentlemen, as our own players are,
and at least this fact should be as-
sumed and Grinnell students as hosts
should treat them with as much con-
sideration as they do their own ploy-
ers, and remember that We Wish our
own players to be courteously treated
when on trips. Another case of rank
discourtesy is the ill treatment which
an ofﬁcial sometimes receives in Grin-
nell. Students should bear in mind
this fact, that the ulTrcial‘ whoever he
may be, has been accepted by the cap-
tain and manager of their own team
and any objections to him should be
made to those men personally and not
to the gentleman in question. His
work, no matter what it may be,sllould
be accepted without murmurs of dis'
approval and his mistakes iftlrere be
any should be assigned to errors in
judgement rather than pai‘tialit)‘ To
those students who are as yet young
in years and in residence at Iowa. Col-
lege we would respectfully store that
the Spirit of Sporismansllip here at
Gi’illllell ls somewhat higher than
that Shown at professiulral bilseball
