All who know anything about Iowa

College, its stand' ds, aiid its ideals
realize that it has qualities that dise

tinguish it from the ordinary weslcru
college. These qualities inevitably
come to the attention 01 all who “1*
vestigate American edunttllnuul instie
tutions, and in consequence, lowa Coir
lege was noticed by the General Eiiu-
cation Board oi New York, who have
the control at a tremendous lund, the
income train which is expended in
strengthening American colleges. This
board usually gives its aid to lusLILur
tions in centers of wealth and nopiilae
iion, but the undeniable worth ot this
College overcame the prejudice :tgniusl
colleges in the smaller towns, and the
result was, in substance, as follows:
This board, on November 27. 1900, vot
ed to contribute $100,000 to lawn Col-
lege, on condition that the College
add three hundred thousand to this
sum to enlarge its permanent endow»
meuti A little later, at the suggestion
or Albert Shaw, one at our alumuii
Andrew Carnegie ottered to contribute
$50,000 more under the same condi-
tions. This made it possible tor the
College to secure a premium ot $150;
000 tor doing what it must necessarily
do anyway it the College were to pros-
per. .

Such an otter as this could not be
neglected and the Board of Trustees
voted to accept it and to seek to raise
the necessary $300,000 hetore Jztuur
ary, 1909, as the conditions speciiied.
Steps were immediately taken to ac-
complish this task, and all the triends
or the College were most liberal in
their gitts. The citizens or Gi'iiiuell
volunteered to raise $50,000, tlie'aiuin-
hi suggested an equal amount as their
share, and the Board of Trustees
agreed to contribute $100,000 Lllemr
selves.

insures the prompt building oi: the
long desired addition to the athletic
equipment and, at the same time, adds
a very substantial sum to the amount
at the endowment rund. The other
classes have taken steps toward mak-
ing gitts and with this generous sup-
port t'rom the student body, a great
impetus has been given to the can»

Taking all things into consideration,
it becomes evident that lowa college
and its triends have no intention ot'
.tliuwing the otter to pass by, and we
iycliere it can be confidently predicted
tnat January, 1000, will see the tull
