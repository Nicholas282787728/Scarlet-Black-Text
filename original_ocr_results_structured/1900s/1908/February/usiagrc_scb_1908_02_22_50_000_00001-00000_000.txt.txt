Without doubt the most distinguish-
ed cl-eut of the College social year oc-
curred last evening at the Rand Gym-
nasium, where the Sophomores were
hosts to the Seniors at the annual in-
ter class banquet. The class of 1910
has long been noted for its social
prowess, and last evening's aitair
proved beyond dispute its right to the
name.

The Gymnasium was decorated with
hundreds of paper pennants of the
two classes, strung about the balcony
and walls and hung thickly along the
rafters. Tlle iflezl: was thoroughly
original and a pleasing variation from
the usual heavy decorations of hunt-
lilg.

Upon arrival the guests were greet»
ed by President and Mrs, Main, Miss
caroliuc Sheldon, and“ Professor
Charles E. Payne, who were present
as guests of honor, and by the 1910
social committee, composed of the ici—
iowing: Roscoe Applcgdte, Walter
Hammond, Harry hi-nntlage, Wyman
Hayward, Carl Klein, Bell Road, Mary
Sliitc, Mamie O'Neill, Elsie Shafer,
Florence Miller and Elizabeth Bed-
ford

The guests wcrc seated about large
tahlcs, art tically arranged. The col—
oi scheme was caiiied ollt for 1on1 in

words concerning the meeting oi the
two classes togcthcr, introduced Miss
Florence Nddler, president of 1910,
who paid an appropriate tribute to the
friendship enjoyed by 1910 irom the
Seniors, and spoke of the love and ad—
niiratinii of the Sophomores for the
class of' 1903. The response was made
by in. Warren Blossom, president of ,
