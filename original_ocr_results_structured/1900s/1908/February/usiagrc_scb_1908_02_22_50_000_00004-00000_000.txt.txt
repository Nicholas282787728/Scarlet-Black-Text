Senior Solidity. from the standpoint
of the Senior‘s love and loyalty to his

given by President Main, who spoke
in his most sincere manner at the ap-
preciation of such an occasion in Col»
lege life. of the superiority and worth
of the two classes, and, ﬁnally. of the
great \ﬂl‘le of the friendships, formed

priately closed b) the singing of “Good
Night, Beloved." by a. quartet compos-
ed of Messrs. Peck. Rowell, \Vestluke
