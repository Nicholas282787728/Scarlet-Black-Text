QBbi'torlal

After listening once more to the
heautiiul Alumni song of Iowa Col—
lege the question again osires, Why
doesn't. Grinncll have a good, rousing
college song that all can join in on
any occasion when college enthusiasm
demands it? Nearly every school has
a song that tiie students delight in
singing;
legev “sings" as they are called, are

in many schools regular col-

lield and on these occasions they prae
tice the songs or their own and other
schools. Glimlell has no college song
hecause we haven't the history or the
enthusiasm oi other schools. We have
no song hecause the students haven't
cared ioi one. it is simply because
no one has ever suhniittcd a song that
appeals to the College. Here is a
chance tor sonic student to acquire
lasting ianic around the College. Let's

have it c llcge song.

One or the iiiiest things tiltolll. cola
lege lit'e toda,_ " the dirteient inter-
collegilite contests which bring the
represcntutnes oi the various col
leges together and in this “in credo
mg non interest as well as non rival.
the

ry between students of r‘ollllti‘lr

mg schools, it is the ewpcctiiiiou oi
victory oler some other college that
causes the various activities to hour»
ish and nthletics or donating limited
to inter-class or inteiusociety contests
would soon languish. Ever s
has its own customs and peculiarities

iool

and it is part or the grand purpose ol
our colleges and universities that re
val contests should bring to closer
relationship these distiiign ~hing cllm'e

acteristics ot various schools.
