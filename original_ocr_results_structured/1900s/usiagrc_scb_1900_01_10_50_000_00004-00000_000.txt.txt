Senior Clube

The men of the senior class
have organized a club, the mem-
bership of which is limited to the
men ot the senior class. The pure
pose of the club is to promote a
closer tellowship among the men
ot the senior class, and to bring
them into contact with the alumni,
thereby torming acquaintances
with former students, They have
rented and ﬁtted up rooms for the
use of its members. Resident
alumni may enjoy the privileges
of the club by paying the regular
monthly dues, while non-resident
alumni are cordially invited to
avail themselves of these privi-
leges whenever in Grinnell. It is
the intention and hope of the pres
ent class that this club become a
permanent one, under the direct
control of each senior class. They
extend a cordial invitation to all
alumni to make these rooms their
headquarters while visiting Grin-
nell.

The Union decided not to give
medals at the Home Field meet
this year.

Propositions tor dual meets
irom Ames, Simpson and South
Dakota were considered. but de
clined, 0n the grounds of there
being too many meets on the
schedule to allow us to arrange
another.

Methods ot raising money were
then considered. The London
Glee Singers were engaged tor
January 15th, as one method.
