All Students Should be Vac-
cinated.

Mostunforlunaiely another-case
of smallpox has developed among
the college students, the second
vrctiin being W. 1.. Brown, ’04.
who livcs ill the eastern suburbs
ot the city. Previous to H. E.
Jones' quarantine, the two had
heen spending considerable time
together working up a debate, and
in all probability Brown tvas ex.
posed during the early stages of
the disease. This is the theory of
the doctors as no other source of
exposure can he found. As the
ﬁrst case was thoroughly taken
care of and all possible precaution
exercised, and as only one ex-
posure to this ﬁrstcase developed
after a period of totriteen clays.
there is how little darigei‘ of an
epidemic, or at any rate much less
danger than if the second case
developed front another source.
But the mere presence of such a
source of contagion in a some
mtlrlily,andespeciallyinacollege
community, where daily contact
with large numbers of students is
unavoidable, maltes all possible
precautionary measures almost
imperative Forourriiiitualbcne
ﬁt and preservation every student
in torva College, who has not been
vaccinated within the required
time, ought to do so immediately.
Not that there is any (car on the
part of the doctors of a dangerous
spread ot the disease, but merely
to forestall the thousand and one
different ways in which it is pos-
sible for smallpox germs to travel
and propagate themselves Stu.
dents should not wait for a man
date from the chapel platform or
the Board of Health, butsliould
show sufﬁcient thoughtfulness to

attend to it voluntarily. t r. H.
E. lanes reports hirnseit over the
telephone as doing riicely,arid Mr
Brown is afflicted with only a
light attack.
