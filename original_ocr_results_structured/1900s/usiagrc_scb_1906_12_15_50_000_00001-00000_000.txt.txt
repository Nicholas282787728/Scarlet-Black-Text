CHRESTO WINS DEBATE. i

Decision Isr’l‘wo in One in Their Faxing;

They also Have Four Men on
the College Team.

The ﬁrst intersociety contest in de-
bating was held last evening in the
college chapel at s: . The room was
iairly well tilled and each side gave
their representatives loyal support,
There was an enthusiastic delegation
irom each or the girls‘ societies and in
addition to the cheering oi. the two
teams manyof them put in aiew good
licks on articles ior the Christmas
bazaar.

The question discussed was. ‘l‘te-
solved: That in the twenty largest
cities or the l'nited states. municipal
ownership and operation or streetrail-
way systems is preierable to private
ownership and operation of the same.
The Chrestomathian society upheld
the allirmative and-was represented
byH. B. Quarton.il.G. Kinsley and
w. H. McClellon. institute had the
negative and her team was composed
of D. E. Breed, Lester M. Thompson
and c. W. Boardman. Professol'J. 1’.
Ryan acted as chairman of the even-
ing and alter a row preliminary re-
marks introduced Mr. Qllarton ZIS the
lirst speaker oi the evening. He
claimed that private corporations are
the inndamental source oi all corrup-
tion in our cities and until the private
iranchise is removed our city govern-
ments can never improve. He iurther
maintained that municipal ownership
would remove corruption. Mr. (.zuar.
ton is astrong speaker and his argu-
ments were, followed with interest.

Dwight E. Breed was the iirst
spealrer icr- institute. This was Mr.
El‘eed's iirst appearance as a debater
and he made a good showrng as add;
hater especially in his rebuttal speech.
He maintained that many American
cities had excellent service under pi i.
vote ownership and operation and
that the municipal ownership was
more pol‘ 'ch than economic. To
undertake municipal ownership would
putau immense tinancial buideii on
our ClLIEs. increase taxes, hurt the
city's credit and would be unwise ivom
a linancial standpoint.

The second speaker tor the ailirm-
atlvewasil. G. Kinsley and he pre—
sented the linancial argument lrom
an aiiii-inative standpoint. Municipal
ownership would be more economical
to the city. The private companies
make vast proﬁts in watered stocks
and capital which would go into the
city treasury under municipal ownei~
ship. iii. Kinsley presented a well
constructed speech with his accustom
ed ability.

L. M. Thompson was the next
speaker on the political side or the
question The boss is due to condi~
tions peculiar to American cities and
consequently machine rule and coir

tract grafts cuntinue. Politics and

street railway management cannot be

RECITAL COURSE OPENS,

Mr. John B, Miller, Tenor, Heard on
Friday Evening Ey Well.l=loased
Audience.

The ii-t oi the seriesni 'tist’s re-
citals was given on Friday evening at
the Congregational church by Mr.
John B. Miller, tenor. Mr. Miller's
voice is wouderinlly llawless, witha
pure legato quality, inll oi delicate
shades or tone. iii singing was al-
ways artistic and‘llnished, and his
songs well chosen. The group oi
French songs was perhaps the most
delightiui. calling ior less dramatic
power and more sweetness oi' tone.
or the English songs the iirstnuinher,
Handel’s “Love Sounds the Alarm”
irom AcisandGalateaivas charmingly
gracetul, while the beantiiul ”One
away, Awake: Beloved,” always a
iavorite, was especially so in Mr.
Millers handling. The “Recompeuse”
and ”10h LiebeDich" were a bihiuadr
equate in volume and dramatic force.
but the lock was amply repaid by the
Handel "0 sleep, why dost thou leave
me,” which was a marvel at legato
sweetness. Mr. Miller will be heard
in the “Messiah" Sunday night.

chancesnrWinningNarrowcdioAcademy
and roan—Games Thursday close
and Well Played.

The elassorlauois again in line ior
the championship in class basket ball.
The Academy team is the only one
that can prevent it, tor by winning
from the sophomores they can tie
them. it is not the general opinion;
however, that this will be the case.
The gomesThnrsday were probably
the best or the season, both in clean-
ness oi play and team work. Both
were close enough to keep it interest-
ing for. players and spectators and
were not won till the very end. A
close decision in either would have
changed the result. The first contest
between the Juniors and Freshmen
was exceedingly close and was a good
exhibition oi the game. No individ-
ual showed up especially well, but all
were in the game utter the ﬁrst few
minutesct play, in which the work
was slow, no score being made tor
some time and all of the baskets
coming slow. The score or ii to o tor
the ﬁrst liali shows this. The second
hair brought out some very iast play
and the linalscore one to 19 for the
Juniors is the record or a great game.
The line up was as follows;
