WE FEEL that mention should
not be omitted in these columns
of the Art Exhibit which has been
held in the Rand Gymnasium dur-
ing the week just passed and is to
be Continued during the coming
week, It has been no slight labor
to bring together a collection of
pictures so complete and extens-
ive as that nolv on exhibition, and
we feel that those who have had
the matter in charge cannot be
commended too highly. Notonly
are the pictures in themselves a
source both oi pleasure and in
struction, but the course of lec~
tures which have been arranged in
connection with them is of a na-
ture calculated to be of the high-
est value to those attending it.
The subjects are carefully and sys-
tematically arranged, a n d a r c
placed in the hands of those who
are best able to deal with them.
During the last week the lectures
have been of the highest interest
and have merited the liberal at-
tendance which they have receiv»
ed. We hope that many more
will take advantage of them dur»
ing the limited space ot time tor
which they are to continue. The
whole exhibition is a tribute to the
regard for the very best art which
exists among the people of the
town and college. We venture to
say that in few other places in the
state could such a project have
been carried out. The appreciar
tion with which the efforts of those
interested in the exhibition have
been met, will, we hope, warrant
other attempts of like character in
the future,

Chrestomathian.

The Wednesday evening meet
ing of the Chrestomathian society
this week proved a great auccess.
The attendance was good, and
the work of the society was car
ried thro' with Considerable enthu-
siasm. The program was started
off with an impetus that was tclt
throughout, by a solo by Miss
Lena Roddy accompanied by her
sisterI and a recitation of the mere
ry sort by Miss Marion Courtney.
The Contribution of these ladies
to the Chresto program was of a

high grade and very entertaining,
and for which the society is very
gratctul. Mr. James Meadc read
several short but tunny poems
from a negro poet. Mr. Mollcr
read a paper on tlle history of the
Healing Art. Mr. Hays iollowcd
with a paper discussing the Beet
Sugar Industry. A daily paper-
read by Mr. Way, who proved to
be the author of the same, con-
tained both fun and sense. Ex-
temporaneous speaking by Me-
Carty and McKee was unusually
spirlted. A debate between two
new members of the society re-
vealed the tact that good old
Chrestomalhia has recently ac-
quired some strong additions to
her membership. A certain phase
oi the liquor question was Supr
ported by Mr. F. Meade on the
afﬁrmative, whose arguments were
assailed by Mr. Monso. Owing
to the lateness of the hour the
customary recess was omitted.
and after a short but lively busi»
ness meeting the society was ad-
journed.

Ellis.

It has been the custom ever
since the Ellis society was found-
ed to give tlle best thought of the
spring term to the study of art.
This year the subject chosen is
Greek sculpture and architecture,
and more enthusiasm than ever is
expected on account of the awake
cited interest in these lines of
study due to the Art Exhibit and
the facility for study that it at-
tords.

After the roll call, responded
to by names of famous sculptors,
Miss Williams favored the society
with a pleasing piano selection.
Miss johnson iollowcd with an ex.
ceediugly interesting talk on the
Collosium, its architectural beauty
and historical interest. The use
of pictures added much to the

value of the talk. Miss Mehlin
gave a very unique impersonation
after which Miss DcLong read
one oi Edward Everett _Hale's
sholt stories, “An Unsuccesstul
Experiment,” the droll humor oi
which was thoroughly enjoyed.

RUBBING?

One of the most frequent symptoms
of eye strain is n desire to rub the eyes.
Itsnems n relrat to close the lids down
tight upon the eyeballs and to press
them with the lingers. This in particur
larly at reading. At ﬁrst the type is
clear and distinct, but in a raw moments
the ayes become tired. There is n burn-
ing or Itching sensation and the type
runs together. Atter rubbing the eyes
and keeping them closed it tow minutes
theronding once more clears upibut
only tor uehort time. In a tow seconds
the Burns trouble occurs IUZH‘D. There
never who u ones or this kind that gluon.
as did not relieve. u is simply n matter
at overworked muscles and by wearing
lenses the work is lessened, If your
eyastroublcyou in this way, cull nod
see me. Ido not churge tor the exuminr
ution. 7.9
