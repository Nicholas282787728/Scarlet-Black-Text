“B have no intention nnr de-

sire to enter into any con-
troversy with the students or au-
thorities of Drake Ulliverslty, but
the statements in 71w Drip/222's edie
tortal at last Friday. coupled with
certain statements in yesterday's
Des Moines papers, justity us, we
believe, in teitzrrillg once more to
what is, at best. a very distasteful
subject. We wish to state again,
our own position, which, we bcr
lieve, receives the endorsement of
all Iowa College people. The in
sinualton. which Y/M Drip/tic

makes, that Griniiell is scelting to
secure the ovei'tlti'owr:er, Gl'

er. in the hope or \vcakcnltlg the
Drake team, is entirely without
foundation, -.So far as Grinnell is
concerned, there is absolutely no
thing personal in her criticisms
Mr. Graeser was tot-motly a stud-
ent in Grinnell, played on the
’Varsity team, and has many
friends here, who are unwilling to
believe hint gutlty and who will
be pleased it he is proven inno-
cent. We say again, it is not the
punishment or lllr. Gi-aeser. we
demand, but the punishment of
the student who is guilty of the
assault upon Mr Lane, whoever
he may be, and whatever position
in the college he may hold.
Whether Mr. Grtieser is found to
be guilty or riot, the obligation
resting upon DrnIt-e remains the
same. it he is onilty, the Unlverr
versity should punish him; it he
is innocent the UiiiverSity should
ascertain who is guilty. and ad

Universny is not seriously doubt-
ed. for there abundant prooi, in
spite of The Dng/tzc's dcnial. that
the assault was committed by a
Drake student, and there is t’tbuuv
donrproohin spiteot T/tt‘DEl/i/lz't'x
denial, that Drake students did
form a mob about the prostrate
ofﬁcial.

There are. however, two things
in TIM Drip/tick editorial with
which we hearily agree. The
Lane incident has not closed yet.
and in our opinion it will not close,
until Drake University takes an
unequivocal stand against the
spirit which is responsible for it,
We agree, also, that it is no light
matter that incident oi this
kind should occur. It is so ser-
ious that we are compelled to
protest; so very serious, indeed,
