morning. They all appeared to
be very conﬁdent of the ﬁnal

say what the score "would be.
Doc Monilaw wore the same “I
told you-so” smile that he always
does and was in the best ofspirits.
It is reported that the genial

may accept.

The meet began at 1:45 this
afternoon under favorable condtr
tions. The threatening clouds

have broken away. and

with the cinder track in fine

shape good records should be

made. Grinnell is not in the best

of condition. although they are
making a stiff ﬁght. Several of
the men are out for various reasr
ons and the team is not so strong
as it will be later in the season.

The I’ennrHigh school meet is
being run oft at the same time so
that there are two attractions for
the price of one. The local high
school is not so strong as last
year. although there are several
promising candidates.

On Thursday afternoon the
iast team from the University of
Nebraska won a vtctory over
Grrrinell in a game bya
score of 9 to 4. A light shower
just at the opening of the game
made the titanium] sticky and
prevented tast playing. The
slippery condition of the ﬁeld
was also rcspotlsible for some ot
the errors

The Nebraska team played a
strong steady game and on the
whole supported their twirlcr in
good shape. At one time they
let up a little and as a result
Grinnell was able to score.

Swalm pitched for Grinnell
and served up a good article at
ball. although he was inclined to
be wild at times. He is rapidly
rounding into form, however. and
Will be mtlch more effective later
on. His batting was a feature.

The lirst league ball game of
this season has been played and
won by the Giirinell team. After
the hard luck our nten have been
playing tor the past week a de-
feat in tltr: game with Cornell yes-
terday would not have been a very
great surprise. It is to be hoped
that the chains are now broken
and that our team will experience
many more such victories. While
both teams played consistent ball
yesterday the feature was prob
ably the batting ot Fillmore.
