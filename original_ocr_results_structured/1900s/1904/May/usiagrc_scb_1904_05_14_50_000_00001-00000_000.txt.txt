Never was the game really in
doubt, it being evident from the

mercy. Grinnell’s one hope was

As it was he must be given credit
for a magniﬁcent effort, which in
nine games out of ten would have
landed the victory. Captain Fillr
mor's wisdom in selectinga ‘south
paw' to twist to a team trained to
pace only a right handed staff
was evident, and probably averted
a genuine slugging contest. A
pleasing feature was the support
given Sivalm, which was of a
superior variety. With Willett
behind the bat, Benson at second,
and Howard back at his old post,
the team presented the strongest

THE MAY FESTIVAL

The Most Successful Concerts Ever Given in
Grinnellc—An Appreciative Audience
Hears Fidelio.

The Grirrnell Oratorio Society
its animal festival Friday
afternoon and evening, May 13

gave

The society is to be congratulated
upon the splendid artistic success
achieved upon this latest occasion.
It is safe to'say that the produc-
tion of Beethoven's "Fidelio” was
as well done as any choral work
which the society has presented
in former years, while the after
concert has not been equalled by
any afternoon concert given under
the auspices of the society.

The ﬁrst number of the after
noon concert, the duct, Graceful
Consort,from Haydn‘s “Creation"
was well given by Miss McGrew
and Mr. Campbell. Miss )IcGrew
gave earnest in this duet of her
beautiful work in theevening. Mr.
Campbell impressed one as artis~
ticin the handling of his voice,
but sang with some restraint.
Tile duet of course was not calcu-
lated to do him justice as a sing-
el, It showed him however coma
plctcly master of the situation.

Misss‘chillci-'s group of songs
was exquisitely given. iIcr best
number was probably her ﬁrst, the
Mtcnzla Aria from“Carmen." Her
qt‘a<p of it was excellent. her
shading and expression ﬁne. or
the Schumann numbers "Soldatcn
Brant” and Lorelei were best giv
“Du blst wie einc Blunte"
was good [run] an artistic stand
point, but disappointing because
ofa certain lac]: olspirituai fervor,
which is the very essence of the
song. The Polacca from “Align
non" was extremely well done.
Miss Schiller has perfect technical
mastery. She is to be criticized
chicf'ly fora certain coldness of
manner and expression. which
will disappear as she grows older,
and appreciates that the thing the
greatest artists desire and appre-
ciate more than technic arid artis
tit: mastery, is warm human sym-
pathy.

The “Samson and D el I | a h”
music was wonderful. Tile chor-
us of . flower girls" was very well
given, Mr‘. Olds as the high
priest was excellent. Mr. Camp»
bell had little to do. but that little
he did well. Mr. Grifﬁth as Samr
son sang well. His failure to inis
press, as the great hero of the
opera. was not so much the fault
of the man as of the voice. Mr,

cn.

 

Grifﬁ'h has a lyric voice, but not
a dramatic one. It is very sweet,
but it lacks in masculine ring and
virility. The bright par ti cri-
lar star of the afternoon was Mrs.
Sclilly, Hcr interpretation of De—
liah held the audiencespellsbound.
it was great, artistically. dramr
aticaily. and best of all sympa
thctically. Mrs. Scully filmy.

The production of the Beethos
vcn opera “Fldello” was a note
worthy musical event.

Miss McGrew's singing of the
part of Lconora,or “Fidelio,” the
faithful one, was all that could be
desired. She possesses a voice of
great range and good quality in all
registers, and aﬁne artistic and
dramatic sense. . Miss Schiller as
Marcelline sang very beautifully.
Mt. Grifﬁth as Florcstan and Ja-
quino, interpreted his part in a
very musical and cnioyahle man-
ner. Mr. Olds' Rocco shelved
much insight and dramatic feel-
Mr. Lyman's ol
Fernando was a surprise and a
great pleasure to the audience.
His interpretation of the part
would do credit to a singer with
many more years on his shoulders

ing. singing

Mr Contlit's solo and his work
in the ﬁnal enscmbk: were done
with his usual rnasttey of musical
situations. Easily the most intcrc
csting and impressive from the
dramatic standpoint was the work
of Mr. Campbell as the villian,
Plerro. HIS big voice and un-
erl'ltlg dramatic instinct lent lite
and animation to all the ensemble
\vorl ,

The work of the chorus
good, both men's chorus and the
full chorus. The soloists anti ace
companist were both somewhat
to blame for some chorus work in
the ﬁnale which was not quite up
to the best of it.

Mrs. HeSSrBurr as the prime
mover in the working out of solo,
ensemble and chorus work is
greatly to be marvelled at. Her
accompaniments are both delir
catc, and broad and convincing; a
most worthy exposition of the
accompanist's art.

The Grinnel Oratorio Society
is to be congratulated upon its
festival, Those who came went

away more than delighted. Those
who did not come have punish,
mcnt enough in that: very fact
