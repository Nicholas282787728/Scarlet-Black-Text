violence, discord and destruction
seemed to reign supreme, out of the

and weakness of the colonies, and up
on the ruins of the old government,
had reared in his constructive mind,
the superstructure of the newimighb
ier, grander, abiding: out of the
gloom caine Alexander Hamilton, des-
tined to ioiind a nation, the most Tar
markahlc in history.

The colonists had come to realize
hut mengerly their dangerous situa-
tion, The scorn of other nations was
upon them. Disgrace, destruction
were imminent. The crisis called for
one to lead the people though this
e tical period, and to bring together
in union. the force now wasted in hos-
tility and opposition This crisis
Alexander Hamilton met when the
wavering people proposed to form a
conimert, l compact, hc grasped the
opportunity with quick sagecity.

organization oi a new government. to
the saving of a crumbling nation.
While other leaders stood hesitating,
doubting, Hamilton centered the
thought of the people upon their own
destiny; infused power and purpose;
matte possible the Constitutional Con-
vention, which changed a comparnr
ti ely petty commercial compact into
a union at national signiﬁcance.

Opposed and thwarted by his col
leagues, Hamilton exercised upon the
deliberations of the Constitutional Con
vcntion but little direct influence. He
gave to the delegates his plan of gov.
eriinieiit, the resultant of the exper
iences of the ages For the adoption
or this plan, he stood alone. Yet, with
the drafting of the constitution. his
untiring energy and efforts given
through years toward the formation
oi a Federal government, were crown»
ed with signal victory.

The Constitution was now submit-

the opening of the state convention,
twothirds of the delegates and tour

him. The most memorable struggle
for the adoption of the constitution
now began. As a bowling, frenzied
moh, led on by unchecked rage anti
unbridled hatred, inconsiderate or its

sweeps on in its work of violence anti
