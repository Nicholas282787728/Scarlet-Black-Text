Fiom the contestantstherew re

Grinnell Institute, Worth, Knowl-

treated the question front the
negative view point, contending
that the NorwayCompatiy System

thc Dispensary System although
granting indeed that the Ititter
was supeiior to the one noiv in
vogue,

Mr. Knowlton's chief aim
to set before his audience the in-
validity of such a. istem from a
constitutional consideration.

Mr. Blathertvick saw the merits
in the system as proposed. above
any other that could be brought
forward. The objectional features
of the present system are obviated
and the Dispensary mode was
superior to prohibition.

A notable fact in regard to this
debate isthatthe meti who won
