[US aiternoou occnri ed the tirst of
the basket ball games in the inter-
class series and troin all appearances it
was also the li t oi the most iutc‘r-
es'tiug series wc have have ever had in
Grinnell. With the growth of the
popularity oi the sport its claim on the
attention or everyone has become pro-
nounced whether he be an active [Jill‘s
ticipator or interesiod only through
his class patriotism. Ami there isa

tunity for quickness, accuracy or
maneuver and strategy odor-col by root-
ball and at the same time no ses few
or the drawbacks which handicap the
great outdoor sport. There is nothing
more spcctacnlar than the swift and
precise movements of good basketball
tcain work and nothing that will
arouse excitement to a higher pitch.
Grinliell’s varsity team or loot was
admittedlyastrorigeraggregauonthan
we have reason to hope for in the coins

material at liaud we are isutilicd in
zxpecting a team thatwill do us honor.
Certain it is that Captain Wildcr and

become a great sport and it deserves
zoriesponding encouragement.
