eolors they wear, It was further
riemonsirateci,last Saturday by a
certain lower class that the de-
partment to iihieli a class belongs

members. In stealing the laveJ-
der and purple bunting,
stances and conditions being as
they were, tlle class committed an
act which we deem unworthy ot
even an academy class.To be sure
the colors cannot be returned but
the members of that class may
perhaps proﬁt by the censure or
upper classmen under which they
have placed themselves, and ivill
undoubtedly in a ten years be
able to appreciate this criticism.
