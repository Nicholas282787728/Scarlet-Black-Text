THE LAST game of the season
was a success. The football team
was in the pink of condition and
played very tair ball, rolling up a
score suPﬁciently large to make
the victory decisive. The enthur
siasm far exceeded anything seen
on \Vard Field this tall. The con-
tinued and concerted yelling was
a pleasure to the ear.and the man-
agement informs SCARLET AND
BLACK. with a smile on their faces,
that the gate receipts were large
and the game paid to r itself.
These are the kind of games worth
having. It is the lcind our sister
institutions have, and Grinncll has
at the tail end ofthe season placed
herself on a par with them in re
gatd to enthusiasm and attend-
ance. It is a pity the revolution-
ary step didn’t-occur earlier in the
season. \Vhile the score was de-
crdedly in our favor. a few facts
should he brought to light cone
cerning' the circumstances of the
Ames team. As is well known,
typhoid fever depleted the ranks
of some of her best men. while the
captain oi the team was called
home the night before the game
by the suddcn death of his mother.
These losses left the team weak,
of course. and Ames is to be come
mended for pluclrily lining up to
her side at the contract and play
ing the game to the ﬁnish. While
all this sounds bad. the teams were
not as widely separated from the
vantage point of view as one might
suppose. Though Grinnell is not
weakened by a hospital list. she is

put very much below the standard
at tormer years by having a raw,
green teami‘the greenest team 1
ever saw," as Coach Harris said at
the mass-meeting. Considering
which it can be safely said that the
team did fairly well. SCARLET AND
BLACK is pleased to announce that
the last game at the season in
Grinnell was a success athletically
and ﬁnancially. and to note that
perhaps some ot the advice, offerv
ed so protusely from these col.
umns, bore fruit.

Y. M. and Y. W. C. A.

The Sunday evening meeting
of the Y. W. and Y.‘ M. C. A. was
last Sunday given over to Presir
dent Gates to be used as he saw ﬁt.
It was not in the form of a ser-
mon but more of a family talk of
president to student. talks which
bring both into a closer relation»
ship and help each to understand
the other better. Mr. Gates' talk
contained many helpful words
and much good advice and was
highly appreciated by these pres
ent. In one way it might be take
en as a summing up of the chapel
talks of the previous week, as he
occasionally referred to what had
been said in the morning talks.
Among some of the things he said
was that the commands of God
are not arbitrary. but all that He
would have us‘do is no more than
justice would demand of us, His

hearers were urged not to go out
into life and seek to ﬁnd the easy
places. but wherever work was to
be done and helpwasnecded, there
to go. There are three courses in
lite to pursue: the law. the pl'incl»
pie, andthe personal, and that per-
son is Christ. Thc man who takes
some great principle to tollow in
life is greater than he who follows
law. but he who takes the person
of Christ for his guiding star is the
greatest of them all. The burden
of his thought hung about the
scripturestext, “I am the way, the
truth and the life: no man cometh
unto the Father but by Me.” Att-
er the service in the chapel. Mr.
Gates spoke at the Congregation-
al church on the relation of the
town to the college.
