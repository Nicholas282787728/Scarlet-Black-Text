CHAMBER MUSIC RECITA L

Miss Alice Fisher Gives the Last

of Her Series oi Three
Rcciials.

Yesterday evening in the College
Chapel, 3 ss Alice A. Fisher gave tile
lust of her series of three recitals.
The programme was devoted entirely
to American composers and was excel-
lentthrollghout. Edward MacDowell
held for {lnumbcr of years the chair
of Music in Columbia University,
Horatio Parker holds a similar posir
tion at Yale. George W. Chadwick is
at present head of the Old and honor-
able New England Conservatory in
Boston. Frank Van der Stucken is
director of the Cincinnati Conserva»
tory. It is not surprising therefore
that a programme composed by these
representative. American musicians
should appeal very strongly to an
American audience and arouse a feel-
ing of just pride in their attainments.

MacDolvell is familiar insome meas-
ure to Grinnell audiences from the
programme of his compositions given
by the Grinnell Quartette last year
‘and from various other programmes.
The songs “From an old Garden" ale
exquisite and Miss Fisher interpreted
them Well, more especially the ”Yelr
low Daisy“uud“Bluebell.” “The Swan
bent low to the Lily,” lainiliar to
many ll'om Mr. Coiidio‘s singing of it,
was given with perhaps not, quite
enough oftlie dreamy undulating m0-
tioli which is characteristic of it and
yer. it was beautifully done. l‘E‘or
loves sake” and “Merry Maiden
Spring” were perhaps most enioyed oi
the remaining MacDowell composi-
tions.

The Aria, by Parker is an exquisite
composition, beautiful especially in
its ending. Miss Fisher sang it with
full appreciation of its possibilities.

It is hard [0 choose among the
Chadwick songs. all being wonderfully
line. The Nocturne recalls Mr. llam-
lin's singing, yet Miss Fisher's inter
pretation did not Suficr by comparison.

The two numbers by Van der Stuckr

the accompaniments in his usual symr
pathetic and l'anitless manner.

The audience is to be congratulated
as well as Miss Fisher upon the last
recital of asp ies so artistic and suc-
cessiul.

THE CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATIONS

A Review oi Pasr Year—Excellent
Results Shawn by Boll-l
institutions

The liscal year oi the Y. M o. A.
Just closing has been one of the most
successful in the history of this or-
ganizalion in Iowa College.

The budget is larger by mo than
last year. innlringa total of $430 which
the Association has dispensed this
year. This increase has been made
possible largely through the plan of
systematic monthly subscriptions on
the partof the members, and also by
the faculty subsription which has al-
most doubled in the past year. The
lecture course was a more ambitious
elloi't than any proceeding course—
some or the numbers costing from
5150 to $350. In conjunction with the
Y. w. c. A. the committee on Chapel
and Association Building have super-
vised the raising of $7000 toward this
project.

Tile membership of the Association
increased from so to 106, and the aver—
age attendance at regular meetings

from 30 to ‘16 rack. Perhaps the most

gratifying increase has occured in the
department of Bible Study. Last
year GO men were enrolled in the six
classes. This year the actual enroll-
ment has been 110 men in the twelve
classes. an average of 9 men per class.
The Y. M. C. A. had the honor of
sending the largest college delegmion
from Iowa to the Geneva conference.
This year in place of nine men the
Association hopes to send ﬁfteen.

Among the social functions of the
year were: the informal reception to
new men at the beginning or the
yoar;tlic general reception given by
the Y. \V. and Y. M, Associations;
and the Bible Study social given last
March, an event which proved a great
success to all concerned.

The Association has been fortunate
thisyearin securing a large number
or outside speakers to addiess the
meetings. Among these might be
mentioned Mr. Chas. Johnson, oi Des
Noines; State Sec‘y MaGee; Mr. Min-
e ‘, Suite Student See’); and Rev.
Dr. lhiird who was present during the
day oiprayei-lor colleges. Mr. Chas.
D. ilul'i‘ey who spoke to the students
on the 23rd and 24th of Feb, brought
amossage to every man who heard
him, and gavea new impetus to the
spirit of the Association. Likewise
Dr. C. Ii. Ilans in his address of April
5th before the student body gave a
new version or the iorcign work of
the Y. M. C. A. Of the faculty. PJoi.
Main, Dr. Steiner and Prof. Stoops
have spoken before the Association at
dilicl‘ent times throughout the year.

To anyone who has followed the

. progress of the Association during the

last year it, has become apparent that
the remarkable prosperity of the work
has been largely due to the faithful

and ellicienn eifortsof Pres. .7. J. IIeer-

DEEATING REORGANIZATION.

Many Plans Offered to Secure Wis:
Organization Opinions or chrc.
senialive Students.

An ellort IS made here to secure the
concensus of opinion In Grinnell upon
alyllestlon which is sure to demand
action soon, The opi 'ons quoted
Delaware all from men who have been
prominent in debating and society
work in Grlnnell. The object of the
[allowing is merely to promote dis»
cussiou and to make the question a
live one.

A well known member of the Chl'es-
tomathizl and an old debater writes
the following:

Even the casual observer must have
become convinced that something is
wrong with debating in Iowa College.
Moreover, it ought to be apparent by
this time that radical improvements
are imperative. To some of us it
seems that twothings should be done.

In the ﬁrst place we should have a.
system Oi'_dcbating which would not
allow any student to get on the inter
collegiate debating team until his
iuuioi- year, Our present system is
detrimental to both the Student and
our debating interests. N0 under-
classman can afford to take the time
from his studies that is needed for
intercollegiate debating. A greater
objection however, is the fact that
such uoderclassmen are apt to lose
interest so that they drop debating
when they are juniors and seniors,
when they ought to be at their best.

In the second place we should revo-
lutionize our methods of choosing
both judges autlspeukers in our prc<
liminaries and intersociety debates.
Aslongaswc adhere to our present
system we may expect to see new and
inexperienced men crowd out man
whom the whole school recognizes as
superior debaters. During the last
four yezlrswllis has happened more
than once. It seems that the Har-
vard plan, the Wisconsin pla-i, ora
modelled ioiin or the plan prescntcd
bytliclacillty two years ago, would
[enlarge extent. remove these dilli-
cultles.

Concerning the debating union our
views are even more pronounced. AS
a role during the last year the union
did Villilt the debaters did not Want it
to do and lulled to do what they ex-
peeled it to (10 Unless it is thorough»
ly l'cOlgallized it would be better to
have no union. Pelliups, (in execu-
tive columlttee chosen from both
societies and responsible to them
would be able to do satisfactory Work.

A member of the Institute Society
contributes the following:

All urgent need at present is a busi-
noss like organization oi the debating
union. To this end a feasible plan

seems tote (I. union composed of three
members from each of the men’s
societies. two faculty members and

one from the Lewis Literary Society.
