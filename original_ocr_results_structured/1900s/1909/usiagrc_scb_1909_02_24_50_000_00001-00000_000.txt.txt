with nearly every seat at the Co~

“Her Own Way" is a play capahle
oi presentation by such a ciuh. It:
was a good selection, we think. There
intense situations out some

oi the individual players. And these,
we are pleased to thinlt, were tor the
most part the situations most nearly
mastered liy the youthful players

The most or those situations fell to
lliss Dale Montgomery in the part o:
“Georgiana Galley.” Her "playing up

the man who tried to he Sam Coast
