THE MEN’S GYMNASIUJI.

The last three days the gymnasium
has been neglected, \'9 much to the
discomfort of the men who have been
compelled to use it. Dirt. no warm
water and a general ill-kepL condition
has made It anything but a proper
place {or carrying on the physical ii-i.
terests of the men of the college. Cold
water may be a positive menace to the
health of a man who is compelled to
use it when heated from violent exerr
cise. Whatever the reason for the
present conditions, tlicy should be
changed at once.

OUR CHAPEL Slo‘li’l'IC
President Main returned from Des
Moines to attend the Friday Chapel
service. About half the student body
did not go from their rooms and the
College buildings to join in this serr
vice. All the students of the College
want a uniﬁed. democratic college lite,
One of the most effective agencies in
securing tilis is the (in - Chapel Eel"
vice. President Main has extended an
invitation to you who were absent to
come. The students who go. invite you
to come. We all want a better Grin~
nell. All can cooperate through the
Chapel service in making a better and

more saiistaclory college life,

such a system He urged the students
0! this college to support the chapel
service, volunmri -, in a more l
