INTEREST IN CITIZENSHIP.

The announcement of the meetings
a! the GoodcovcrnmeutLeaguesbould
he of interest to every man in school.
“lith the enlargement of the Work
of the Political Science department
as is described in an other column of
this paper, the demands and obligate
ions of the privileges ot citizenship
will receive an attention which has
not thus far been accorded them.
Both the formation of the League and
the increase of courses in the Politi-
cal Science Department point to an
awakening interest along this line.

. SPRING ATHLETICS.

. It is hardly nECesSary' in a- school
like this Where participation in the
diﬂerent branches of athletics is Eu
general, to call the attention or the
men of the school to the Opportunity
before them in this ﬁeld, There is,
however, need for greater emphasis
being placed on the preparation for
me spring work. Only in conscienr
tious training is man to avoid the
extreme physical discomfort which
comes to the unprepared in hard coli-
tests. It is poor condition that causes
more pain and loses more points than
any other factors. Now is the time
to prepare for the Spring class meets.
not the last week in April. Every-
man has the possibility of winning
points [or his class, if lie will train
properly.

CLASS SCR “’8.

The report of the class scrap com-
mittee will probably meet with both
approval and condemnation. it is
hardly fair to judge a plan of this
sort before it has been tried but it is
safe to assert that if it has been
deemed necessary to continue this am
cient and obsolete custom some simu—
ier method of regulating the hush-
ities would stand a greater show or
success. Various plans have been
tried in other institutions but it is
difficult to ﬁnd one, where these at-
iairs are managed to the satisfaction
of all parties concerned. Frequently
all regulations are disregarded for a
free-lorrall uii why the Sophomores
should annually offer themselves as
a sacriﬁce [or the developmentct a
class spirit among the Freshmen is a
little difﬁcult to determine. Class
scraps are out of date when it her
comes necessary to appoint a special

board to manage affairs with the
prospect of arbitratillg a good number
of questions before the winner may
be determined. The experience ofthis
year establishes tlle fact that a class
may have an abundance of spirit,
without rolling all over the campus
to awaken it.

The Colonial party of the w. A. A.
on Friday evening was a splendid suc-
sess from every standpoint.

The Woman's Gymnasium was beau-
iiiully decorated with {lags iind red,
white and blue Wiper streamers. Cozy
corners were arranged
parts of the room, where the Colonial
names and their golisnt partners
might “sit out” dances, or Sip frame.

The costumes were unusually clev-
er and attractive, testifying in truth
the simple beauty and stateliness of
our toretalhers time.

Promptiy at eight o‘clock, Miss An-
dersnn‘ and Miss Hillman iod oi! the
Grand March, which was one or the
prettiest features 01 the evening. Af-
ter thnt the regular dancing program
began, interrupted only by s minuet
graoeiully executed by eight mem-
liers oi the committee. This was an-
other especially attractivc feature.

The balcony was crowded with spec.
tators the entire evening in spite or
the announcement that it would be
closed until ten o'clock.

Miss Anderson, Margaret Miller, Ada
Peterson, Juliet Buckley, Ruth David-
son, Ade Schoessci, Floy Korns, Dale

tive and, successful parties or the
year.
