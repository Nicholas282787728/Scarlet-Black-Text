Simpson‘s Challenge.

Simpson College has been making
2 great ado in the state papers with
res'ard to Griilllell's refusal to soiled-
uie a basketball game uitli her and
is even advancing some claims to the
state championshipv When the matter
was ﬁrst proposed to the athletic mane
agement here there were two reasons
why a game was not scheduled in
the ﬁrst place the schedule was as full
as experience had shown it advisable
to ‘ﬁll a basketball schedule and in
the second place our

to excuse defeat. had not been espe-

eiaily pleasant. They had shown no
disposition to abide by the state eligie
bility rules which we observe and her
home court was not or regulation style
or shape. All the reasons which were
opposed to the scheduling or a regular
game are also opposed to the art-ans-
ing or a post-season contest with the
additional iact that Simpson has not
made a record this year which entitles
her to such consideration. We believe
the scheduling of such a game would

be ill advised.

A great deal has been said and heard
the past rew days with regard to the
scheduling oil a. game or
games with Kansas University to de
termine the basketball championship
of the trans-Mississippi region. The
team this year stalling with only meti-
iocre material has developed into what
is generally conceded to he the most
efficient aggregation which has ever
represented Grinnell on the basket-
ball court. It is but fair to them. after
a schedule in which they have, so far

This communication comes to soar
let and Black headed: “One reason of
several why we don't have a band."
it is from the pen of a member of this
lens short ved band:

it uould seem, to the members of
the band, that before turning over a
"surplus,” the “Iowa College Republi
can Club" would have done well. or
better, to pay the band for services
rendered during the recent presided
Liai campaign at a meeting under the
auspices of the “I. C. R. Club."

Time is money: we used our time.
Music costs money; we bought the
music.

Moral: We need the money.

Ed.~lnquii‘y reveals this: That al-
though the meeting in question was
advertised as uiider the auspices oi
the College Republican Club, that ar—
ganization did not assume the ﬁnan-
cial end oi the transaction. The club
may be c ticlzed to a certain extent
tor neglecting to present the claims
of the band before the settlement of
airairs by the Republican County Com-
mittee. but cannot. truthfully‘be accus-
ed of retusing to pay its legitimate
debts,
