men of a season without a defeat.

The most surprising feature of the

game to those who have seen Gi-i .

Dell‘s forwards in action in other

games, was that Grinneil was not able

to score a single ﬁeld basket during

the entire ﬁrst half, so close and so
classy was the work of the Des Moines
guards, Hyland and Norton—inci-
dentally, an old Grinnell man.

The game started with a rush. The
Des Moines team secured ﬁve points
lead to start with. Then Grinnell got
a point on a free throw. This was
followed by a session of hard ﬁght
ing in which one field basket and two
free throws were made by the Des
Moines team. The Gl'inuell aggregar
tion got shot after shot, but luck seem-
ed to have left the team, for not a
single basket could be caged. The ﬁrst
half ended with the score 3-3 in favor
of the “Y."

INAUGURAL BALL PLAN;
DECORATIONS SIMPLE

Another of the Winter’s Pleasing
Social Aﬁairs Occurred on
Saturday Night.

The \Vomnn‘s Gymnasium was tbs
scene of one of the most pleasing and

original functions of the year, last

Saturday evening, when the Junior
class entertained the Freshmen at an
inaugural Ball.

The decorations, consisting entirely
of red, white and blue, were simple
and digniﬁed in eirect, but exceedingly
attractive. In the center of the room
was placed a large, white column.
from the top of which crepe paper
streamers in the national colors ex-
tended all around the room to the top
of the balcony. Pretty, red, white and
blue paper shades softened the glare
from the multitude of lights which en»
circles the balcony and added a quiet
lustre to the whole. i

When all the guests had assembled,
appropriate programs of the events of
the evening were given out. One or
the most pleasing numbers was a
Minuet, representing the First Inaugu-
ral Ball, and given by Juliet Burkley,
Helen McGlll, Ruth Harper, Hazel
Wagner, w. E. Proctor, E. A. Cupp, in
G. Hammond and H. D. McCullough.

At the close of the evening an elec-
tion was held to choose a President
of the evening, and a consort, R. R.
Gill, '10, and Harriet Eldridge, '12.
were the choice of the company, and
a public installation was held at once,
in which the oath of Mice was ad-
mi istered and the President's inau-
gural Address presented. During the
Grand March, representing the Last
inaugural Ball, a tiny fairy in her .
flower-chariot, presented each guest
with a carnation as a favor of the eve-
ning.

A novel idea, very prettily carried
out serving to
groups throughout the evening, (mm

ated with ilags and colored lights. The
refreshments, too, which were simple,
carried out the idea. of the evening.
The committee in charge follows: M.

say, Barbara. Cornwall, M. Clark, Hel-
eu Sinicoke, Lenoir Hood, A. McIn-
tosh, L. D. Brereton, Marian Frank,
Lois Baker, and R. S. Knowles.

Dramatic Club Meets.
Last night the Dramatic Club hold

its regular biweekly meeting. The
study of the evening was Clyde
Fitch’s drama, ”The Climbers.” which
was read by Deborah Wiley. In tho
business meeting nothing of particular
importance was done.

Freshmen Win Game.
Last Saturday afternoon, while en-

route home from Ottumwn, where they
were deieated the night before. the
Freshman team took on a mixed 93‘
gregatlon of Penn College and Osha-
loosa high school players at Oskaloosa
and defeated them by a score of 36-33.
