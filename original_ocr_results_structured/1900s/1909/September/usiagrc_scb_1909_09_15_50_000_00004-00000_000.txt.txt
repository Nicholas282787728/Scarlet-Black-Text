sentative men of the colleges of the
middle west have gathered for the
eighteenth annual coulerence of the Y.
M. C. A. Here hetween June eight
eenth and twenty-eighth, hundreds or
men enjoyed ten days of the mast ex-
hilarating recreation. Here these
same men received a new understand-
ing of themselves, their rellon men and
Jesus Christ.

It would he impossible to detail how
all the afternoons were spent in recre»
ation, boating, baseball, track work,
etc., or what part the Grinnell and
Iowa men took in the various contests.
It would be equally Impossible to out-
line the inspiring messages that were
presented in the Life Work meetings,
platform meetings and conferences.
Suffice it to say that the faculty was
composed of men of such heartrgl‘ip-
ping power as Fred B. Smith, “Dad”
Elliott, Dr. Bosworth, DI'. Henderson
and Bishop McDowell.

Grinneil was represented by Dr. E.
A. Steiner, J. Murray Flanagan, Ralph
H. Garner, Lyman V. Cady, Harry L.
Bruudage, Joseph A. Daiuer, Iii-rose
E. Boyack, Joe C. Watson, Leslie V.

rison. These men declare this one of
the greatest events of their lives, one
to be planned for at least once during
every man‘s college course.

One of the most pleasing events of
the sumiucr vacation to many College

said he wished to make the prophecy
that "o. rainy September maketh a

as I know," said President Mni . “The
sunshine in the heart or the Senior is
