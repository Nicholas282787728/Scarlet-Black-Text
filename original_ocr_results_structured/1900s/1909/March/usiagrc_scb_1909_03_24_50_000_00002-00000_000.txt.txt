A Communication.
There are two points in the new plan
for a student council which are funda-

mental. Other details may he or impor-
tance but upon these two points de-
pend the success or lailure ot the new
plan. The ﬁrst, is the nature oi the
constituency which shall make up the
organization. in order to give the
council the prestige, dignity and in-
ﬂuence which is essential to the suc
cess of snclr an institution, it is nese
essar-y that the membership be largely
conﬁned to the Senior class. Fresh
men and Sophomores have neither the
experience nor the initiative which
is essential to a body to be entrusted
with the powers such as will devolve
upon the proposed eaunLil. Juniors
although they might add something
to the emciency of the organization
would on the other hand tend some
what to detract from the recogni 'on
that would come to a Senior organi
zation. Tile nest emciency is to he
secured through Senior membership
with underclass representation as has
heen provided.

The second thing turrdenrerrtal to the
is the
interest, or
the people who are elected to serve it
makes little dirterence what particular

work at the organization, the par
lar httness which is required for suc
cessful admin tratiou or its duties.
and the opportunity ior iull unbiased
investigation of man's ﬁtness should
he entitled to the prixilegc of inahing
all nominations subject to the approval
or the class and laculry. It is not
eccential whether that number nomr
nated be ten or twenty as long as the
Council's experience is allowed to
count. (in the other hand it i simport-
ant that the best will or the people be
at all times expressed and through
their opwer oi selection or rejection oi
those nominated they may prevent the
council ircm tailing into the hauls at
any group or iaction, Here we have the
ideal of all eﬁicient and (lelnaclzttic
government combined, Through the
careful consideration possible on the
Council only those best ﬁttcd are homi-
nated while in giving the class comr
plete lrcedom to accept or reject any
number of nominations there s ainplc
protection given to the spit of de
mocracy.

A plan which falls to incorporate
the above two features has but little
better prospect DI ﬁlling a. place of

greater importance in our school life

than that which the rnncli maligned

student council now holds. We now

have in the student council an institu-
tion which is an ideal creation of the
democratic idea incorporating the fear
tnres or universal representation and

unrestricted freedom of nomination.
It has tailed to realize the need or
student government in Grinnell Col-
lege. The plan proposed avoids those
two evils, which have contributed most
largely to the iailurc or the council.
The plan proposed provides for a denr
ocratic anti eil'rcient organ or student
government. G. A. CLARK.
