Grim-oil, 1u., Suturdot, Feb. 6, 1909.

At one point in the writeup ot the

NUMBER Si.

intel'escciety debate in Wednesday‘s

issue the afﬁrmative was mentioned

as winning the debate. This was a

misstatement, tlte contest being non
by Chi-estnntnthilt who supported the

negalite side.

About three years ugo there was
don-ted to Iowa College the Proctor

base hall cup to he awarded to the

winners of an inter-class baseball

series and given with th object oi
stimulating iitterest in and developing

material for, the baseball teams.

Each year these games have been

played with a minimum at interest
and, absolutely no heneﬁt to baseball
interests. At its last meting the EXv
ecntive committee at the Athletic As-
sociation discussed a change in ar-
-rangements and promise a settlement
or the matter at the next meeting on
Wednesday night. There may he, to
one versed in base-ball, technical (lifs
ﬁculties which would he illsul'llloullts
chle, hut to the casual ohscrrer it
would seem timt the interests ot all
could best he sort-ed by playing this
series before the ’rnt-sity season opens
and admitting 'vot-sitr men to compel:
ition.

Grinnell has lit past years ohm ed
remarkable success on the basket-
bttll court anti to no one tiling is this
more directly all ’ ttohlc than lo the
scrtcs

When it is co'lsitls

snappy class preceding the
lvai-sity season.
ered that at the littlvcrsitv cl lllitiois
for many years the premier school ot
the west in base-ball, some two hiin-
dretl nicn annually appear as base-
ball candidates it \tottld seem that
such a series as is Drnpasod and tit
such a time. bringing at least 45 than
before the eyes or tlios whose dttll' it
is to 1'1le d team, were evaclly whzti
Grinncll needs to not her b ball
teams on an editrtl looting with her
teams iit other branchos ol othl~tios

It has been urged in optics ion to
this plan that the time :troilnble is
not long enough and is all needed tor
’vzti-sity practice but observation has
shown that the first \vecks' basesbnll
practice consists of little more than
the crudest ltind oi lilttting and ﬁeldr
in: practice which could certainly be
obtained in such a. sertcs. in addition,
it properly managed the series could
easily be disposed oi during the llrst
week after the spring recess.

There are certain objections to the
plans proposed but we believe the
advantages pointed out are more than
Sufficient to outweigh those object-

ions.
