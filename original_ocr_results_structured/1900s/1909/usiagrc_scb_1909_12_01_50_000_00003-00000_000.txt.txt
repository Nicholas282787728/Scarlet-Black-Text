The deans of the University of
Michigan are attempting to have it
rule adopted barring Freshmen from
all student activities, In the dean’s
office the literary department, where
the rule originated, there is nothing
but praise for its working. Dean J. 0.
Reed in his position is ztble to tell
exactly the benefit. "As an example,"
he explained, “take the presidents of
the Freshmen classes (or years back.
Drawn by their position into all sorts
of activities, almost every one of them
was dropped from the university be
fore their second year. Now We have
provided a remedy. The one great
thing is to get the boys started right."
