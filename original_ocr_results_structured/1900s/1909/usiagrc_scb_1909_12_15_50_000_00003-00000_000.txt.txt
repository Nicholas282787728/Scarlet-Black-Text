According to Dr.
Stilt”.

Saturday oiternoon a reception was
held in the Botany Laboratory for Dr,
Shun of Cold Spring Harbor, New
Yol' . Dl'. Silull talked ior a short time
on plant breeding and gave a tew very
intcrestiug facts about Luther Burr
bank. Dr, Shull told how the theory
of heredity can be applied in the
breeding oi plants and, with corn as
an example, evplained the process oi
selection used in obtaining hybridized
varieties which will site a greater
yield than could otherwise be obtained.
nr. Sllull has been working with
Luther nip-bank for the large part oi
his time during the past three years
and he told how ircm the basis of his
own experience and observation is
number or facts in regard to the "Plant
wizard." Luther Burbank has been
credited with having produced a great
number of species which he really im-
ported. For example, the Japanese
plum A great many stories or Bur
bank have appeared, which greatly -
aggerate the number or plants Bur-
bank has in his gardens. It was stat-
ed a few years ago that he had over
300,000 varieties oi plums and when
an inventory was taken the number
was actually round to be 572. Last
spring when Burbank’s potatoes were
set out it was reported that there were
4,000 varieties planted out oi 11,000
which he had. Dr. Shull upon actual
count found the number to be 398,
“Luther Burbank never counts the
things which he plants,” said Dr. Shull.
"But he is largely responsible for the
reports that are circulated as to the
number of his varieties. He merely

with, when if he would careiully' ac-

count for each one his work would be
simplified and results appear sooner
than they do.” We are then, to take
some or the reports which we hear oi
Luther Burbank, with a grain of salt,
remembering however, that he is per
fectly honest in what he does. but is
not a scientific or an exact man, Bur-
hank's work in propagation has been
done with cutting much more than
with seed and it is in this line of work
that his more remarkable results have
been obtained,

HEATING PLANT.

During the cold snap oi the last feu‘
days there has been no work
at the new heating plant, and things
are as they were a week ago. If the
cold had held oii one day longer the
brieirlayiug would probably have bgcll
completed and the other part oi the
work carried ahead, As it is now the
only Work that can be done is the
making oi cement blocks in the linse-
ment of the Ladies' Gymnasium. The
condition ot the weather will deternr
lne how long it will be betore the plant
is ready for use.

INTERVIEWER.

“I do not believe," said a junior gi
the other day, "that. conditions in the
main room in the library, or in the
stack room, will be very much im-
proved until ihe students are allowed
to use the downstairs rooms for study
in the ev‘ening. Very otten lessons
must he left until the evening, and as
there are only two or three lexicons
oi the diliercnt languages in the read,
in; room, two people must study to-
gether, Of course it is disturbing to
do this in the reading room or even
in the stack room, but it has to be
done, when the rooms downstairs are
locked up. Why can‘t these rooms be
opened to students who will use them
i

or duiet study?"

“I think the attention that football
has been given in the last two issues
at Scarlet and Black is a very good
thing." s id Prolessm- Gaiiuaway, “and
I should like to see more comment
along the same line. Tile interview
column is certainly a very valuable
thing. It gives the people who are in-
terested in things around the college
an opportunity to express their views
and brings about a good deal of Val-
ualllo discussion.”
