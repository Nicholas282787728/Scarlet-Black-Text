address was especially interesting in
that it dealt with tiiat stormy period
before Lincoln's nomination, during
which he spent so great a portion of

the endeavor to make the people see
the evils of slavery and the danger
in which the nation stood.

Mr. Sailborn compared Lincoln to

Mr. Saiiborn traced Lincoln's r' e
in politics and with it his growing
hatred toward slavery and his love
for men. He spoke at some length
of the great Douglas-Lincoln debates
in which Lincoln, more than anywhere
else in his life, showed his wonderful
sagacity and keenness of intellect.
The Kansas trouble was outlined and
a speech which Lincoln made in Kan-
sas, showing how nearly he agreed
with John Brown in his views at slaw
ery, was read in full.

Mr. Sanhorn expressed the thought
that Lincoln’s- greatncss lay in char-

Thu Program. .

Another of the notable events in the

musical realm, which is occupying so
prominent a place in the social life at
irinnell this winter, occurred Thurs-
day evcuiiig when Katharine Goodsoh.
the great English pianists, appeared
in recital at Herrick chapel. Natur-
ally, those who are interested in pl-
audlorte are wont to compare Good-
son with the other two great artists
who have appeared here recently—
Samaroff and Gabrilowitsch. She
Most of
us recognize in her playing greater
power, hroader tone quality, and a
holder and more maseuline style than
that possessed by Samaroit, while in

stands the comparison Well.

her playing is more pleasing and more
satisfying. Her interpretation seems
more sane, more like what we imag-
ine it should be.

There is an indcnnable something
about Goodson that brings her close
to her audience and makes her music
vital to them. It is something more
than her personality or her stage
pres'ence—Samarolf excelled her there.

The program was a splendid selec-
tion trom the greatest composers, and
it was so evenly executed that it is
well night impossible to suggest any
"best" numbers, The Schumann group
was as masterfully handled as any,
and was altogether pleasing. The sec—
ond movement from the Grieg Senate
was also noticeably good.

without doubt the Chopin numbers
were the most pleasing to the endl-
ence as a whole. In place of the ”N00-
turne,” the artist played the "Prelude”

D flat, one of the Gabrilowitsch
numheis. it was played fully as well.
While the climax was not so great,
still the breadth of tone was greater.
illlll the general quality better.

The “Aeolns,” by Cerusbeini, was
povlarmed with remarkable technical
ability which few in the audience not—
ed. The Liszt Rllitpsodio was the
crowning number. It was played with
a dash and a passionate intensity that
were thrilling. oiie ot the best known
