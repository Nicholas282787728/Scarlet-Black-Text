THE DEFEM which our reprer
scntatives experienced in the dee
bate held at Mount Vernon last
night is necessarily a disappoints
incnt to all who had been hoping
for a result entirely different, but
it should not be made a reason for
uttcr-discouragement, Thei-csults
of this year's work along the der
hating lines cannothe summed up
in the terms of one defeat. For
the ﬁrst time in the histoly of the
college, ourdebatlngwork is mark
aged according to a cleal'rctlt sys.l
tem. The choice ofspcakers thro'
interesociety debates has put an
end to the old slip~shod measures
once in vogue and we can test that
our debating is now on a basis
which is bound to bring usvietory
in years to come, if adhered to.
Moreover, during the year a
healthy interest in debate has been
maintained which promises to
produce a number of excellentde-
baters in the next few years. We
should not permit one deteat to
diminish our enthusiasm; its ef-
feel. should bejnst the opposite.
We have been defeated four times.
Let us see that it does not occur
again, It is the duty of every
man who can debate to go into
training in order that we may ef-
face the memory of defeat by a
victory next year. For the faith
ful and seltesacriﬁclng work of the
men who formed our debating
team this year, we have only
words of the highest praise. We

only hope that our future teams
will manifest an enthusiasm and
diligence equal to that shown by
this one.

Art Exhibit.

On Monday atternoon the art
exhibit was opened to the public,
and quite a considerable interest
has been manifested ill the open
ing days, both by the townspeople
and the students. The essential
completeness and the great edtie
cational value of such a presenta
tion of the best art deserves the
thorough study of every student.
The opportunity here presented
for study and to acquaint oneselt
with great art is rarely enjoyed
outside of our art galleries. Cone
sidering the immortal worth oi art
in its effect on the individual and
especially on the community lite
and spirit. it would be a beneﬁcial
custom to have an annual exhibit,
with a systematic and permanent

ence. It would be no very great
task, and the excellence ot spirit
created thereby would be highly

compensatory.

In the present collection the’

Greek sculpture is quite thorough.
ly represented and becomes more
and more interesting to one as he
studies it, because of its perpetual
treshness and purity. The Roman
sculpture grows perceptibly out oi
the Greek conceptions, so we ﬁnd
them closely akin in lorm and
conception. The early Italian art
is well represented and is of great
interest as showing the childhood
endeavors in painting. and giving
opportunity to trace the rapid den
velopment from the stiff lifeless
form to beauty of expression and
exalted conceptions. The three
great masters of the Renaissance,
da Vinci, Michael Angelo and
Raphael, occupy the deservedly
large place, The Venetian school
and School oi Bologna are quite
interesting and inspiring. or the
modern Schools, the French and
English are comparatively com-
plete. Lectures have already been
deliveletl by Miss Millerd on
“Greek Sculpture.” and Prof.
Green on “Greek and Roman Are
chitccture." All evening lectures
are to be given in the Rand gyme
