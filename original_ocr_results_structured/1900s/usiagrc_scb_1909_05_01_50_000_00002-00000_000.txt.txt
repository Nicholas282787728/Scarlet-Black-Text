. my Not a Band!

There is no one who attended last
year's State Meet nut remembers with
just a. touch oi shame, that the only
time Grinnell-s rrech men were per
mitted to hear their College song, it
was through the courtesy of the Ames
band. A year has passed since then
and the feeling in the henrt 0! ever-
Grinnell ninn st that tune, that heiore
another year Grlunell must have a
hand at State lleet, is no nenrcr renlr

zation than it then was,

The experience oi this tall and oi
previous years has dcinoiistriitcd coir-
cliisiieli that it is not incl: oi iiiiis-icul
ahility illllt has prevented the organ
izntion or d bond

rallgemcnts uliich have hurt the hand
but these ciiii. in no case, he attiihutod
to a scarcity or student support.

The reason we lltIVe not had a hand
is that the capable men have lacked
the spirit at sacriﬁce nliith is as news
sary to glue Iowa College a hand as it
has been to give her athletic teams
and debaters. The hand has assumed
the attitude at siipporiing the proverh
ial chip on its collective shoulder and
the leaders have been too prone to feel
the enormity of the sacriﬁce tlle)‘ arc
making,

The redsons why we need a lhiiiil
have beeii.olt repeated. We do not
hold {or a single moment the belief
that, in the time herore State Meet, a
ﬁnished band can be organized, but we
feel that an acceptahle hand could with

It is the duty of every man
