AUDIENCE GREATLY PLEASED.

Mrs. Baker Deiighiiully Entertains a
Large Audience With Readings
From uCyrano de Bergerac."

Before the coming ot Mrs.

Baker, her reputation as one of
the very highest in the ranks of
readers had preceded her to Grins
nell and people were looking for
ward to an entertainment of far
there than usual merit, and corn
trary to most artists, she left her
hearers with the satisfaction of
not having been disappointed.
Mrs. Baker introduced the read-
ing by a short talk about Cyrano
de Bergerac and compared its
spirit with the American spirit or
torday. Alter this introduction,
the reader began the presentation
of the story of the famous Gascon
with the remarkable nose. The
work requires extraordinary nhili-
ty. for only the grealest skill could
successfully make the quick
changes Irom one character to arts
other.

Mrs. Baker was fully equal to
the test and her presentation
brought only delight and pleasure
to everyone who heard. From
the ﬁrst word to the last she held
the closest attention and interest
of the audience. Hers is the art
or expression, and last night's
entertainment was an exhibition
of the highest and best in that
art. With a voice of great power
and penetration as well as com-
pass, and a splendid stage pres
ence, Mrs Baker is able to pre~
sent the most tragic passages and
those of pure comedy, with equal
effectiveness.

The large audience which at
tended the reading was very sails

tainment last evening. will doubt-

DR. SANDERS ADDRESS.

Interesting Discussion or “The Prophets-

and their Religious Ideas” Higher
Criticism and Interpretation.

Both iacultyand studcnlsturned
our en masse Wednesday night to
hear Dr. Sanders, and everyone
present was treated to a genuine
revelatron in the discourse pi'c»

senied. They could see, too, just

why Yale could notspare this man
a year ago, and they got some no-
tion of what we missed when Dr,
Sanders declined the offer of the
presidency ot Iowa college. The
talk was an interpretation of the
Old Testament prophets in the
light of modern study along lines
or critical analysis or the same
sort that has come into vogue in
all branches of historical iesearch.
The value or the prophecies. Dr.
Sanders said, depends upon the
fact that they deal with the rela-
tions of God to man. It is by this
modern plan of investigation that
the Divine Hand is revealed un-
mistakably in the Jewish history.
Applying new 'niethods or study,
as Dr. Sanders did, givcs us with
mathematical certainty number-
less demonstrations of the truth of
Christianity. The ﬁrst step taken
in the treatment of the subject was
a rearrangement of the order oi
the prophets. With this done ac
cording to chronological succes
sion. the speaker pointed out four
distinct groupsot prophets, each
of which was the natural product
oithc conditions of society and
religion. Thewordsottireproph
eis were suited to the needsolcon
icmporaneoussociety. Heshorved
what the several prophets in the
ﬁrst group had in common and to
what exlent and how the work nl‘
eztch strengthened and supple
mented that otevcry othcr. When
israel had forgotten its obligations
to Gntl, an Amos was needed to
warn the people of punishment, a
I—Iosen was needed to tell of God’s
motives and an Isaiah and ti Mir
cab to promise ultimate strrvival
and usefulness.

The connng or a speaker who
can trace evolution or thought and
environment as vividly as did Di.
sanders, will always be regarded
as an event ot special prominence
on the Iowa college calendar.
