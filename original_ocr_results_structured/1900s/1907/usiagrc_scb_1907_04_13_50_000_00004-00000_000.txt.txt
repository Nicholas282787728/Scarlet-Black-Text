DEEATES NEED SPIRIT OF
RIVALRY.

Continued lrom siirrulonicni,

printer-est. The cause lies rather in
apartial lack oi the spirit of rivalry
existing under our present Intercol-
legiate system. Herein lies the secret
of the signal success of the Grinnell
debating spirit when in compact with
Cornell.

This does not mean a complete con-
demnation of our present Triangular
system out it means that we should
ask each other, whether or no this
spirit of college many can he truth-
fully said to exist under its present
conditions. In not, the life or a certain
phase oiour Grinnell spirit demands
that debating be put upon anew basis
it is the groivrng Ames spirit that
is last bringing that institutruntothe
front in debating circles for at Amos
thissprritoicollege rivalry is strong
and itis this spirit of rivalry which
will alone determine the success 01‘
Grinnell‘s future debating. Whatever
system of Intercollegiate debate we
possess next year the success or failure
or Grinuell's debating for nineteen
hundred and sight is reliant upon this
fundamental principle. for college
rivalry is indeed the line of Intercol-

legiate debate. R. P. SI'EEli.
