Our \Abused Language.

It. is often the commonest faults
which are the most commented upon
and those often pointed out which are
the least liable to correction Likev
wise those which receive the must
emphasis are frequently ol little imr
portance. In the present case we are
taking it ior granted that the matter
in hand is important, but we do not
presuppose that the evil pointed out
will experience immediate correction.
Neither do we think that tlieiiuestion
has been emphasised any to much.

The point at issue concerns the
matter of pronunciation, a thing
dimcult enough in the English lan-
guage. even to the one who knows no
other. That which brings it to mind
is the contestin publicspeaking which
was so much enjoyed last evening.
One or the noticeable Iaults which was
present in every speech was the ten
dency to hurry over words, omit and
slur over syllables, a tendency which
resulted in a horrible slaughter of
what is considered good English. If
Raphael could hare heard the lu~
famous handling of his name we iancy
that the great artistwould have taken
steps to hare it ch an ge rl. The
"guv'menn" also sllﬁered us much as
usual.

The men who spoke last night are
by no means the only ones guilty or
these misdeeds. All of us are prone
to hurry ollr talk and sprinkle it with
incorrect pronunciations. Even the
SCARLET AND BLACK has been known
to iorget the right way to use English
and the professors themselves are not
free from the habit. It is only a mat
ter of carelessness which any one who
so Wills can lree lllmsel lot.

This is rather bluntly spoken, out
it is a disagreeable subject hurried
through to the end Let's do better.
Enough said.
