HUFF WINS NEW HONORS.

Grinncll‘s siar Sprinter Makes Fine Re-
cord During rhe Summer.

This year an Iowa College Athlete
iras met with phenomenal success in
eastern ﬁelds Hiiil has been running
under the colors of the Chicago
Athletic Association. He was very
successiui in the local meets held in
Chicago but it remained for his two
last performances to place him as one
of the premier sprinters of America
At the held and track meet of the
Central Amateur Athletic i‘uion held
in Chicago. Hull won the hundred
yard dash defeating ~woody” Hamlin
ton in the record time of 9+5 seconds.
In this race he lowered their. A. U.
record In") of a second. In the two
twenty yard dash he took second to
Hamilton in 21 4-5 seconds. At the
Jamestown Exposition on September
7th the track and ﬁeld championships
of the Amateur Athletic Union were
held. In this meet Hull took lirst iii
the hundred defeating such men as
Dan Kelly of the University of Oregon
also Parsons, another Paciﬁc coast
sprinter, and Patrick‘li‘ealy. The
time was 101-5 seconds. Hull‘ also
won the two hundred and twenty
yard dash in 221 5 seconds.

There is no longer any doubt that
IIuix is one of the greatest sprinters
that American Colleges ever turned
out. He has come upto and surpassed
the star recol'dsof Criim and "Speedy"
Rush because he has made records
euiiai to both and hisstar perform-
ances have been more consistent and
have coveredalarger range of time
All Iowa College students ioin with
the Scsirtnrzc BLACK in congratu-
lating “Doc“ on his excellent: success
and the new inme he has brought to
Griuneli. He will return to Grinneii

,Lhis week and begin his college work

again witii the iunior class. Iluii is
track captain for the coming year and
under his leadership Grinneii students
are expecting great things in this
year's track work.

“Iiedd . Hamilton, of sprinting
fame, is spending a few days in Grins
neii visiting his brother. He was pres
vented from taking part in the races

repairing has been done in Chicago

sign up on the general register in the

after by the Association. and is
necessary to obtain the names for the
General Reception. Any studeutfull-
log to receive an invitation is request-
edto make the fact known to the
committee (or in the large rush of
students some are liable to be over-
looked.
