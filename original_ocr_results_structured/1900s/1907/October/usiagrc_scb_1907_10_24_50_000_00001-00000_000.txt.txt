With a team rlclllomlized hy illiul'~
res and sickness and a back held his
most entirely new, lowa College did
well to deieat the uervi. hard-work
lug team ircm Des lioiues College by
a score of is to 4, Saturday at \vurd
Field.

Three touchdowns were made in
the nr-st hail, from none or which was
a goal mzlrlc and in the last hall Man
shall, a new man ut quarter, made u
pretty goal from ﬁeld, Marshall’s
work was the brightest ieature or the
day, his printing being unexpectedly
strong and his sensational run or 100
yards tor a touchdown alter an are
tempted goal irom ﬁeld, being one oi
the most thrilling performances or
the aftemoon. A iew weelrs ago the
great problem which ccnrronted
coach Hamilton was the development
of n quarter-hack. with such men as
Marshall and Bruudage, it looks as
though the problem was pretty well
solved. Des )[olncs scored on a goal
from field.

Team work was not noticeable to
any marked degree, which, howerer,
is not strange considering the‘new
men in the lineup. The result is not
at all discouraging and if the llooelioo
in the term of a large hospital list,
which has followed the team all ran.

gaged in lecture work.

Needless to say there is a. reason for
for Mr. \Vdrds’s success, and this
reason is round in the fact that he is
c genius, and withal, he is endowed
with a charming personality, , ﬁne
presence and great magnetism. He is
it thorough Shakespearian scholar. He

bearing, a grace of speech and gesture
that one can only attain by years of
experience, backed by natural ability.
In his lecturesispl‘inkled throughout
with remarksione learns more about
Shakespeare in two hours than the
average person would getinayear‘s
reading. It is a. delightful Shake-
speare that Mr. Waldo present Sm the
audience. Probably no man has sues
ceeded in placing him on the lecture
platform so sutcessiui as he has Mr.
Wards.
