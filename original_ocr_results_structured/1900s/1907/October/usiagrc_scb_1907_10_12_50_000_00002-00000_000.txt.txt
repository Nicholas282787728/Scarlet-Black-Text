scarcely :L college paper has come

some plans or an account on “reform-

and Freshmen. The annual class

seems to be under-going a radicll
change in most every school and the
general sentiment has become pre-

many schools a committee of upper
class men have been chosen to adjust
matters but we have it permanently
organized body for that purpose in
in the student Council. We would
suggest that the council put this
down as 'd sublect for future dis-

FRIDAY CHAPEL TALK.

The Friday morning chapel talk:
which was made by Professor lien-
llrixon, wasa plea iora larger num-
her of students to do graduate work.
The talk was alougaline or which
the average student rarely ever vhinlvs
and was most instructive and sup-
gestivc.

Proiessor Ileudrixson began by com-
plementing the college upon its stand
ard of work and its scholarship, Then
he made the point that [cw of the
students in college ever consider lur-
ther study in graduate schools, Our-
system of education was likened
toa pyramid, where all alike enter
the primary school, but where n grad-
ual process of elimination thru high
school and college leaves but; a. few lo
enter graduate schools.

The advantages ollsred to the man
who will undertake graduate work
are many. Through liberal scholar—
ships. he may do his work with proc-I
tically no cost to himself. Having
done it he need never fear for his po-
sition, for there are more positions
open than men capable of ﬁlling them.
Business men prefer the graduate stu-
dent ror technical work. Two other
opportunities are oosred to the man
who has done graduate work. He
may become a college professor and
thus spend his life moulding the
minds or others: or he may do re-
search work which will add some-
thing new to the world's store or
knowledge, ‘

Tile talk was illustrated oltsn with
iaors and ﬁgures drawn irorn actual
conditions existing today, and Lhzu-
out was most able and scholarly.
