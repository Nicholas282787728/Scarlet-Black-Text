BIBLE STUDY YEAR OPENS.

Classes Conducted By Y. M. c. A, Will’
Be organized Sunday.

This coming Sunday will be organi»
zation Day (or the Y. M. c. a, Bible
Classes. Some or the groups will meet
at 9:15 and'others at l . The Y.
W. c. a. classes will also meet ior
organization on Sunday.

The beginning or these classes marks
the opening or one of our most impor-
tant studentactivities. The manage-
ment is entirely in the hands or the
students. though heartily cooperated
in and approved by the faculty. In
this movement are united more stur
dents than in any other student activ-
ityexcept the Christian Associations
themselves, and last year the work in
the Men's Association interested
many who were not identitied with
that organization.

Grinnell ranks up among the leaders
in this new movement ior systematic,
deﬁnitely outlined Bible Study.
Among schools oi her type, Oberlin
and Dartmouth are the only colleges
in the United States which havea
larger enrollment, and on the basis or
the percentage of men enrolled to the
number or men in school, Grinuell
stands at the head. with seventynve
per cent. ‘

There isagreat deal or discussion
today as to the best methods in Bible
Study. The conclusion to which the
Association has been led by experience
is this: that the Bible can be studied
historically and yet derotionally. The
courses thereiore are arranged on that
basis. For Academy students and
Freshmen and ior such others as care
to take it. courses in the Liie of Christ
are oilered. For the more advanced
classes, a course in the Old Testament
is oirered. A text prepared by Kent
and Smith is used ior most of the
work, which treats the Liie and
Teachings oi the Minor Prophets The
prophets cannot. be understood, how-
ever. without studying the political
and social environment in which they
lived. The ﬁrst part of the course,
therefore, will trace the development
or the Hebrew people.

For Seniors an advanced course will
be oiIered. Proi. Smiley will lead the

group in the discussion or such prob-
lems of the application of 6113 Bible to
life as like men desire to raise.

The Association is looking fDrWard
to a successiul year in this Bible Study

the aria from "Madame Butterfly.”
Miss Abbott's interpretation was
essentially dramatic, [his seldom
