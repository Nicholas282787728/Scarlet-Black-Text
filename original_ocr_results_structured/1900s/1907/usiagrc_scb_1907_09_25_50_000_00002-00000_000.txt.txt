It is undoubtedly true that heat

and attractiie postcrs aid in the ad-
, verriseuierit or the Y.Mr and y. W.
o. A. meetings. but care should be
taken as to the iorni and subtect
maitn‘ oi the posters. One of the
posteisni rhis week, while being a
better rid. lor an animal show than a
Y. M. c A meeting. the reading
matter on the poster is nonsensical
and has no connection with bible

study so far as we can see.

In this issue ‘will he found an ace
counter the lecture course which is
oriererl to the students this season by
the Y. iii 0. A. committee. The ob~
JEGL of the course is not for ﬁnancial
gain, for the cuurse is so planned as to
just pay for itseli, but it is the aim to
place beiore .the college the best
speaking and musical talent that can
be procured. In our busy life in col-
lege we sometimes int-get about the
aiIairs oi the world at large and what
is being acoOmpolished and what is
being said outside of labramry and
class room.

The object of the course is educa»
tional and instructive, to bring beiore
our attention what active and pro-
gresstvo men and women are ac-
compolishing. The price is such that
it is within the reach or all and the
course is one of the student enter
prices that deserves support.

It was no idle assertion made by
our president a few days ago that.

highest and best in college work tor

A large number or college news
papers come to the Scarlet ard Black
every week and that these may be or
beneﬁt to the students, arrange
ments have been made to keep the
exchanges as usual in the newspaper

Unless college people iorrn the habit
of keeping posted on current events
and discoveries while in school the
chances are that they never will.

Among Lhe many student organiza-
tions which the Freshmen are urged
tnioin, none are oi any greater im-
portance than the literary societies.
No man can atlord to spend tour years
in college and not avail himseli ot the
training in debate and extemporr
aneous speaking that is airorded by
the literary society work and in
addition an excellent opportunity is
aliorded ior parliamentary la w drill.
Society work in Iowa College is not
campulsorynorrequired and as a re-
sultthe members are all interested
in the work of the sacleby. Nu ac-
complishment is so valuable nor is any
as liable to be asmucll use to a man
in his liie out oi college as the ability
tc’preserit a subject in a clear, li pical
and entertaining manner. Many men
prominent in the alrairs or the world
at large received their ﬁrst actual
training in speaking and debating in
some college society. The time spent
in attending society meetings and in
the preparation or subjects for the
program is small compared with the

benelit which is unconsciously gained.
