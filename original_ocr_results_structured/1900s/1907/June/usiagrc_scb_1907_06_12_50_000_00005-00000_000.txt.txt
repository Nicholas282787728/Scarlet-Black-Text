One or the best rhiugs oi the coin
mencement Week l\ as the address of
Dr. A. B. Storms before the Christian
Association Sunday evening. This
has grown to be a regular part or the
commencement program and such ad~
dresses as listened to Sunday evening
serve to make it one event long to be
remembered. Mr. Dawson and Miss
Evans had the meeting in charge.
Miss Alexander favored the audience
with a solo .

Mr. Storms extended to the local
association the greetings from the Y.
M. C. A, and Y. W. C. A. of Ames,
He Spoke of the interest and appreciar
tior they had of the work done here‘
in Grinnell, He took for his subject,
the signiﬁcance of the cross, taking
the wards of Paul. “Far be it from me
to glory, save in the cross or our Lord
Jesus Christ” as his text. He said in
part, Paul might have gloried in his
Roman citizenship, it was a thing
which any than might, well glory in,
he might have glorled in his rrioe,
coming as he did from a people who
have played such a noble part in the
World'shistory, he might have gloried
inhis education,ror he was an ably
trained man, he possesses character,
ability to discriminate, the power oi
initiative, all cliaraclerisrics of an
educated man Drlle miilht have gloried
in his religion, a vital [actor with
Such lenders and law givers as Abra-
ham and Moses, in the world‘s life yet
in none or these things did he glory
but rather in the cross of Christ.

Paul was an able historian he could
See things in their perspective, he
could See the power behind the cross,
he better than any other was able to
see the cross as ti connecting link be-
tween man and God In the cross he
Could see hope, the hope orimmnrtali-
ty, love and vspenrznce In the hope or
the cross there is an adequate motive
for life. Tllespeaker held the atten-A
tion oi the audience throughout.

Edward A Steiner, of Grinnell, has
just completed a novel, The Mediator,
that. gathers up into a stirring piece
of ﬁction the wealrh of romance and
passion of hope and feeling that hare
marked his many magazine articles
and his previous book, On the Trail of
the Immigrant. The Mediator breaks
ground ina. new hold on ﬁction, in
making its hero one oi the great num-
ber of foreign born Americans. The
central ﬁgure is the son ofa Jewish
rabbi on the border or Polish Russia:
revolts at his father’s faith. almost
completes his training {or the Roman
church, rebels against that and comes
to New York and ﬁnds true life here.
Mr. Steiner's pages seem to burn with
the passionate enthusiasm that clear
triﬁes his audience when he is leclurv'
ing. The Mediator will appear serial-
ly in three periodicals and in b'ok
farm irom the Fleming H. Revell
Company in the early iali.~Times Re-
