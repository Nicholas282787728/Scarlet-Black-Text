» oh Student Support

One oi the iunc'tiouswhicu a college
paper is obliged to perform is that or
oirering a medium through which
various college activities can be boost-
ed, To all projected schemes it. gives
its editorial support as well as art
vertising space and calls upon the
student body to be loyal to each and
every organization and team which
represents the college. This it does,
though it knows that everybody realr
iv e the reason and will thereiore take
little stock in what it says.

When it, cornea to the editor’s real
views it isa diirerent thing. Person-
ally he is obliged to say that in college
as everywhere else a thing must stand
on its merits and not demand Support
merely because the duty or the sine
dent body is to stand behind it.

(This little conﬁdence was necessary
because we wished to apply the last
named principle to a certain ac rity
which demands much attention at
this time or year )

Ii ever anything merited support
anti has fairly earned the right to the
conﬁdence oi the Student, body it is
the three athletic teams which so
well represented lows College last
Week. The little round package which
the track team passed out to Drake
on Saturday prores that they know

, their stunts perrecrly : tuohard games
won by the baseball team on successive

days is a iact to be proud or, while ‘

the overcoming or our Methodist
rivals by our tennis team deserves
praise. They are not through either,
and that's the best or it,

There are some who support an
athletic team under any circumstances
There are others who only do so when
the team is winning. To this latter
olaesweeay, brace up rind be some
body Yourleams have proved Llielr
ab LY, srishow them they have not,
worked in vain. Four contests out or
live in two days, What more do you
