Grinneii Defeats illiles on Track.

The end or a woman‘s tongue is not
tlieonly place where a hair an inch
makes an immeasurable distance, for
inst that much on the last and or a
broad jump was the deciding point in
Saturday‘s track meet with Ames
where Urinnell won by a score of 09 to
It was hardly that one thing that
won the meet for the loss of any oi a
half dozen thirds would have tied the
score. It. is merelyan example ofhow
close the meet was throughout and
What a little it would have taken to
make a great (lillerence.

In Spite of a cold Wind blowing
directly up the stretch some fast time
was made. and in spite of the Weather
a big crowd witnessed the contest.
Aines sent a good sized bunch or root-
ers who Look care to make it known
that they were on hand. The meet
was started almost on time and Was
run all with promptness while the
bilnd did its share of the rooting.

The Aggies showed o little more
conﬁdence in the outcome than did
Grinneli supporters. due to their ex-
pectations or winning the no and the
mile relay, [Oi'tllouglllhe latterionked

great all vantage which Ames' strength
in the weights and distancesgave her.
All dopesters ligiiied the meet very
closely and knew that it was only a
matter of a few polilrs one way or the
other.

Alter the ﬁrst few events Ames
took the lead in points and kept it for
agood part oi the time. Once when
the score was .ST {0 Eli things looked
pretty blue in the Grinnell sections.

pulled up though until the grand linale

The Inc and 220 came easy, Mar-
shall‘s race to take third place being
a crowning fe'iiLure (lull being one of
the things which kept the meet from

to win the hurdles, though Ames
didn't think so, but the distance
which he beat Henninger was 8. pleas-

May Festival Opens.

First Concert by Contrnlto nnd Tenor
who PleasaiDuers nre Especially
Well Sung.

The May Festival was opened last
night beiore a large audience, by a tee
oital sung by Miss Elaine De Seilem,
conti‘alto and Mr Edward Strong,
tenor. The program was in no sense a
popular one. but was rather educa-
tional and or great artistit merit.

Mr. Strong, whoopened the program
with all aria from La. Boheme. was a
singer ofmarkell reﬁnement, exllu isite
ﬁnish and technique. Ills manner
was quiet and controlled, his legato
being especially pure and sustained
although possibly used somewhat too
much. His best elrecrs mere Obtain-
ed in suchsongsas, ”Our Lite is Vain”
by Johns and particularly the “Mob
gen” by Strauss. The songs requiring
dramatic power and volume 01 tone
such as the encore numbers were (“57
appointing, but on the whole, on line
pi-essioii oi ﬁnished musicianship was
clearly leit by Mr. Strong’s sillging.’

Miss De Sellem possessed a charm-
ing personality which was no small
factor in the eil‘ectoi her rich sym-
pathetic voice, purely court-alto in
quality and skillfully managed. The
two French songs were beautifully
sung, but lelt the reeling somehow
that a soprano Could have interpreted
them more elrectirely. Miss De Sale
Item‘s German was true and rich and
produced her best ell‘ect.

The two duets were thoroughly liﬂ!’

GRINNELL NINE WINS AGAIN.

Cornell Loses. 4 to LAGrinncll

piuy the Game.

The Iowa College bisebcll team
added another to her School’s many
recent victories by‘taking‘ one more
easy gacne from Cornell Monday.
Four to one tells the tale, the reason
being twofold. E‘rei of Cornell was
the only opposition the Griuneil men
had. while all nine or them played
real ball.

Things were started in the ﬁrst
when a hit by Fisher and anothdr by
McCormick brought. in two runs In
the third a couple of errors gave the
chance for another run and just to
clinch it one more was added in the
seventh. Allthe While the Cornell
boys were wondering What sacoud
loolred like, though Barber was going
as slow as possible. In the sixth a‘
little encouragement was oifcred when
Gi'innell allowed the bliss to ﬁll up
with no outs. One run was present-
ed but the other batsmen died It sad
death. In the Seventh Blrber began
to pitch and the ﬁgures described by
the batsmen at the plate would be
worthy a Dutch Windmill. Flue busi-
ness.

lllrd oI Cornell pulled down a pretty
ily in tlieioiii-tli which would S'il'ely
have been a LAO bugger.
