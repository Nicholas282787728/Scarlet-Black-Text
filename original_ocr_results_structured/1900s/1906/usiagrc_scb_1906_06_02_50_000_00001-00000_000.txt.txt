though it is improbable that any class
will secllle more points than the Jun-

that ilccmlllt, the Freshmen and

second honors.

The System being followed out Is
this: Each OI the {our college classes

two sets out of three With every other
single team except his own olnssmate,

plnys every other double tcrun, for

fortyscigllt points altogether. Each
class has a possible twentyfour points
