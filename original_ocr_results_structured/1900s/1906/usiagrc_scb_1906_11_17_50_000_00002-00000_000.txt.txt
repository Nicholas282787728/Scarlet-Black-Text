Qﬁhiturial

Elsewhere in this issue is published
the question for the Freshman debate
between Uhi‘esto and Institute. We
would urgo all the Freshmen or both
societies to consider this matter care-
rully it they have any ambitions along
debating lines. In the past the Mad-
emy society was the only real prelim-
inary training a man could receive in
debating and after he had Joined 3
college society he stood on equal footr
ing with all the other men or the so-
ciety in the intersociety preliminaries:
But under the new system a debate
ior Freshmen only has been provided.
This gives men a chance to secure
valuable training in debate and to
ﬁt them for the intercollegiate can
taste later in their college course. Go
into the preliminary and whether
you win or lose you have been bene-
ﬁted by the practice and given that
much more ability {Dr future elrorts

Among the various topics discussed
at the meetings of the Student Coun-
cillastyeal‘, the social needs of the
College were brought. up for consider-
ation and acommiuee of tile council
recommended a reception at one
close of the football season in addition
to the customary receptions held. We
would like to see this matter given
some attention and We believe that
the present Council should take the
matter under consideration. The
general sentiment among the student
body is in favor cl such a reception.
One feature of such an event could be
the awarding of the “Honor G" to the
men who have earned them during
the season. We have had a good team
this year and one which has been a,
croditto the school. Every man on
the team is here for Work and it is
considerable of a sacriﬁce to spend
from two to (our hours a day in root»
ball practice for the lirst two months
of school. The school is ready to join
in and make such an event a genuine

the {all elections about the wonderful
increase in independent voting, due
partlyto the removal of the circle
from the ballot and due yet more to
an increasing attention and enlight-

political policy, It was the good [or
tune oi the students of Iowa College
when an able talk in Chapel last
Tuesday morning on the political sitr
nation in Philadelphia. by Mr. B. C.
Marsh, ’98. He showed very plainly
she importance of relorm in political
lines and the agency through which

and fearless men, not engaged di—
rectly in politics but in lines or work,

onthe purity of the political power

higher grade oi citizenship to study
these problems that he may be able to
cope with them in his lac-er lire.

In regard to the ﬁnal statement of
the question for the Triangular
League debates between Ames. Drake
and Grinnell. it has been necessary to
to call a celiierence of the three
schools. H. I. Worth is in Ames to-
clay us the representative of the De-
bating League.

FRIDAY MORNING CHAPEL,

The Chapel service on Friday morn-
ing was conducted by Rev. E. M.
Vittum or the Congregational church.
The central theme of his address Was
che call for leadership and the part
that college men and women ought to
take in being leaders. The principles
of democracy have always existed in
our country yet today the old standard
democracy of morals is gradually
slipping away. A new leadership in
morals is needed and college men and
women are looked to to assume this
obligation.

Many of the modern methods of
business are contrary to the old
standard of morals and men are re-
quired to do that which is against
their ideal of honesty. But even
leaders are not the best examples to
follow and pattern after. In the con-
sciousness of their leadership they
may become priggish and seli»esteem-
ed. After alltlie thing to do is to
live and live right. if We so live as
to accomplish those things which
are oestior ourselves we are doing
that which is best for the World.
