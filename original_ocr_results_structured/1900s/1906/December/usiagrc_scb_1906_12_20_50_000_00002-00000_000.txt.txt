Grinncil, Iowa, Thursday. Dec. 20, rgoo,

(‘Ehitati al

The approach or any public event or
holiday is always the occasion ior
editorial comment, and in college the
remarlrs generally build themselves
up around the idea of “spirit,”
college, class, or uliaterer it may he.
It is a rather roundabout matter to
connect college spirit with Christmas
but under the present circumstances
Grinueil Spirit and the Christmas
spirit may be brought very close to-
gether, First or all, don't forget to be
an Iowa College student while enjoy-
ing the Christmas vacation. This
does not implya suit case inlloi books,
loud college yells our long tallrs about
college “stunts," out it is possible, ii
one only tries, to carry home a Grin»
ncll atmosphere which will command
respect and iriendship. But most of
all there is a chance to exhibit a little
real love ior Iowa College while at
home The institution is beginning
on a iinanciai campaign which means
much. Through the eiIorts of oi our
iriends we are to he the recipients of
alarge appropriation from the Edu-
cational Board. Have these iriends
more reason to be interested in the
school than we who are not only close
to the college but are the college?
Here is the opportunity to do some-
thing. We can tallr Grinnell without
boring our irlends and ii rightly done
there is a chance or accomplishing
much in a very material way.

FRACTIONS,

Tilt) much heralded ”Paris of u
l'niL." appeared this weeli and is being
disposed of by the board of editors
from it sales table in the Library. The
book isa ctillectlon of ten stories se-
lected by the Unit hoard train the
ﬁles of the publication Since 1900. As
the editors have stated in Lheir pi'of»l
ace, the intention was to make a sou.
\‘enlr volume from the representative
literary eii‘oi‘ts oi Iowa College stu
dents oi the past ﬁve years, and lite
result» is Worthy of the high purpose.
The only Ci'ILicisiu is that; tho men’s
side of college liieis given more prom-
inence than the girls', especially the
athletic features.

The 1)on is neatly bound and pre-
sents an attractire appearance, while
the bypographioul work is fairly Well
done.

The contents of the book are: “The
Nerve oi It". by Evan Erans,

Game.” by Glenn Clark, ’05: “Me,
Nefs Love Story," George Richard-
son, ’04; “Laughely, Lord or Lost
Trail,” Curl Foster, ’05; "InaFrieud’s
Eyes," Adah Hopkins, ’05; “The Lady
ofDreams,”Emii Suckow, ‘08: “Jane,"
Gordon L. Berry, ‘06: “John,” Ilelen
Howat, ’05; God Will Give Sails,"
Ruth Green, '06: and “You Never Cruz
Tell,” DeWitt Spi‘ague, '03. Most or
these stories were published Within
the memory or the present generation
of students but lose none of their val»
Lie from being republished, All are
worthy a. place in such a book: none
are improper fractions.

It is the hope oi the present Board
that. the custom of publishing such a
volume will be continued, and that
every ﬁve years the best productions
of that period be put into permanent
form.

The present edition is one of 250
copies, most of which are subscribed

ior. They may be obtained at the
library any time this weelr. Although
it is not tiie idea or the editors that
this be a moneysmaking venture, it is
hoped that all will procure their cop-

ies as soon as possible.

"THE MESSIAH” is SUNG.
An audience which ﬁlled the Con<
gregatioual church to the doors, at.
tested to the delight; felt in the Sing-
ing of the Handel “Messiah" which
has not. been glvenin Grinuell [or four
years. Achoii'of sixty voices, under
the leadership or Mix Smith, did er-
cellent work in the choruses, although
the change of accompanist made
some confusion. Mr. Hlx of Marshall-
town did Well at. the 01’ng considering
the short time [or practice and his un-
familiarity with the instrument, ills
though it ls unfortunate that illness
prevented Mr. Scheve from playing.
The solo work was all careful and
musicirtnly, Miss Heller’s singing her
ing especially- well liked.
