Since it has become pub]

that the Sophomore class at its meetr
ing Monday night voted to publish
the names or those present and how
each voted on the resolutions adopted,
there has been conmderﬂblc discussion
as to whether or not the management
or the SCARLET {c BLACK would prini
the list. After serious consideration
We have decided that, such a proceed-
ing is not really the wish of the class.
evidenced hy the fact that people
from both sides have expressed regret
at the serious of the class. At least,
nothing is to be gained therer y. There
is no personal reason on the part or
the management nor any connected
with the paper, but it is evident to all
that to printthe names would make
permanent feelings which otherwise

Among the advantages which lowa
College OlIel‘s to its students there is
one which hardly receives the atten-
tiou Which the time and money ex»
pended on in make it deserving of.
The recital course as presented by the
school of Music has been under a con-
stantcourse of improvement during
the last few years and is now at a
place where a list or complete artists
is Oﬂemd on each course. Grinnell is
a musical town and deserves the rep-
utation. The recital course has done
much ro make it and keep it so. The
regular lecture course is made up al-
most entirely of lectures, musical
numbers being left, 06 purposely, as
much better results are obtained by
leaving this part or the work to a
different management which is in a
position to present better rnurnbers at
a more advantageous ﬁgure than
could be obtained by the regular
management. Many who have never
amended EL recital will be surprised to
ﬁnd how enjoyablethey are. Whether
you frully appreciate the music 01‘ not
there is much pleasure and good to be
obtained from attendance at these
recitals. The price asked places it
Within the reach of everyone. In is
an opportunity which lew places. even

college towns, ouer.

ON THE BASKET BALL COURT.
[Cominued [mill First l‘ag:(

Hopkins. Fouls, on Juniors
Academy 14. Awards, to Juniors 2.
Ollicials, Brundage and Valerlus.

Last night’s game nnnlly developed
into an interesting struggle between
the Seniors and Preps, the latter win-
ning by a score or 21 to 18. Although
the Seniors showed better iorm than
during their Saturday exhibition,
there was still something lacking:
Poor passing was directly responsible
iorthe loss of points and iailure at
easy baskets lost many more. Senior

W

team work was fair, except for the
passing, though a tendency to long
throws marred the work. Both sides
had dimcnlty in getting the ball away
[l‘om under each obller’s basket, each
side often making a haitdozen throws
for goals in succession, the inability
to locate the basket being the salva-
tlcn of the opposing side. The ﬁrst
hali started out witliaseeming ad-
vantage to '07, out on the whole it was
Academy property. The second half
was more exciting and the game was
not settled until the last pistol shot.

Although twc soph. players were
on hand and ready to play. the rest of
the team were wanting and the game
between them and the Freshman was
postponed.

The line up was as follows:
