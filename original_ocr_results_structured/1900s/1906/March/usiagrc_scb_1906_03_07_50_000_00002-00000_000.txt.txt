IXTY yearsot set me. That is
what Iowa College represents.
For thi-eescore years Iowa College has
been the aims mater or a vast number
at young men and women. During
that period Iowa College has risen
Iromzt dream in the minds of a'iew
Christian men to the reality of today,
with its numerous buildings and beati-
tiiul campus. “The environments
have changed, but. the ideals are tiie
same.” It is well worth while ior ev-
ery student to stop and consider what
those ideals are: We tear at times
that many students are rushing
through Gl’iuncll without, knowing
what Iowa College with its ideals and
its traditions means or represents. We
believe that Iowa College has today
just as many students of the Griunell
type as it ever had, and yet there are
times when some students seem to dis
regard all the ideals and standards
which are cherished by the best men
and women oi the institution. What
these onenses are, we will not say. It
is not necessary, tor every student
knows or should know the standard oi
lite which pervades here: We merely
call their attention to this fact. and
remind them iowa College stands tor
the highest and best in the world to-
day. Sixty years have brought many
changes but the ideals of our fathers
still remain. It is well for all at us to
lrnow what those ideals are and wlly
they have remainedunehnngenhle. We

CALL FOR RADICALISM.
Continued lroln ﬁrst We

young women, unless you propose to
be radicals in your day and generation
and get ready to do some lighting on

ibis ridiculous for you to pretend to
admire Washington an d Lincoln.
Oberlin has stood for radicalism and
its prosperity in the future will lie
along the pathway of tenrless opposi-
tion to wrong in any form.
