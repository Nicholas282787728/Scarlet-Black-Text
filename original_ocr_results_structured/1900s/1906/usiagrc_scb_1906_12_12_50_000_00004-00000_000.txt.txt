Kondo, the Japanese who lectures
under the auspices oi the Epwortll
League at the M. E. church next
Monday night, was greatly interested
when he learned that Sen Joseph
liatayamh,’512‘was a graduate oi Iowa

Japan,“lle said, and I have heard him
speakandsecn him oiten. But he is

and corrupters oi morals. The London

press the playhouses, hut owing to the
Court's iaroring oi actors could ac-
