THE CONFERENCE RULES.

c. E. Fisher 'gp Explains Some or the
Technical Points for the Scarlet and
BlackiThe Rules in Dciailr

At the Faculty meeting held on Jan-
nary 5. the athletic rules now in force
by the universities and colleges (‘Omr
posing the sorcalled Conlci-enoc, were
adopted, and as these rules include in
all but one detail the rules of the Iowa
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference,
the latter were also adopted. Tile
main difference between the two sets
of rules is in the ﬁrst article in each
set of rules. Whereas the Iowa. rules
require only an eighteen weeks’ resi-
denco rule, the Conference enforces a
residence of one semester before par-
tlcipation in athletic sports. Tile dif-
ference between the wording of these
two rules would be, that while accord
ing to the Iowa. Rules 6. man would be
eligible to take part in athletics on

' May 1, if he had entered college by
the middle of December, the Confer-
ence Rules would insist on his being
in college irom the beginning of the
college year in the tall. A second
point of diirerenoe is in regard to the
migration of athletes, or change from
one college to another, According to
the Conference Rules, an athlete gn-
ing from one institution to another is
required to have completed a years
work before being eligible to partici-
pation in athletics in the second insti-
tution, whether or not a year may
have intervened between hisresidence
at the two institutions. The Iowa
Rules also required. year’s residence
at tile second institution bciore par-
ticipatiou in athletics except in case
or a year’s time intervening between
such residences in which case the
eighteen weeks’ residence rule would
hold good. in case or both or these
diﬂerences in the sets of rules. the
Conference Rules will be enforced by
the college athletic authorities.

The {allowing is an additional stip-
ulation of the Iowa Rules which is not
included in the Conference Rules:

”All lists of players certiﬁed for in-
tercoliegiate games shall be mailed
prior to the ﬁrst intercollegiate game
to the secretary of the (Iowa) Confer-
ence signed by the president and the
faculty member of the athletic board
of the college, stating fully any special
conditions."

The adoption of these Conference
Rules will not make Academy students
ineligible for college teams, but on the
other hand, will allow an Academy
student to participate one year as an
Academy student on acollege team,
without having it counted against
his four year's participation as a col-
lege student. Each year in excess or
one year’s participation will count
toward thelimit or four years Tile
adoption or these rules will prohibit
summer base ball playing except by
special permission Irom the proper
athletic authorities, and then only up-

 

on nonrprol'essional teams which have

no permanent organization.

By the adoption or the present Con
ference Rules the faculty has not
bound ilseli to the adoption or all

changes to the rules which may be
made in the future by the Conference
Colleges, but any changes which may
be made will become operative only
upon special vote of tile faculty.

AN rLLUsTRATED LECTURE.

jacab Riis Comes Next Monday Night
iGivcs an Aurhnrirmive Statement
or lnreresring Fools.

\iery seldom hits the lecture ccul‘sc
colulnittecthougllt itadvisableto “re-
peat" an attraction. It is the inten~
tion cithe course to present as wide
arangc or talent as possible and to
bring before Gl‘irlnell audiences as
as many high class speakers as possible,
but men who are as active in the
allairs of the world as Jacob Riis der
serves extra attention. This man is
the foremost student of social con-
ditions in this country and has done
more active work toward the better-
ing oi evil circumstances than any
other person. Four years ago he was
on a Grinnell lecture course and
brought disappointment to none of
hishearers. Next week he is to be
here again to talk once more on one or
his great subjectsithe occupation of
which has received the elIorts of his
wholelifeinamely, slum and settle-
ment work in the places where social
conditions are the very worst. This
does not mean, however, that the
lecture Will be the, same. Even if it
were’no one should neglect the educa-
tional opportunity oﬂered by it, but
the title alone is old. Four years
of Work have given new insight and
new evidence and material so that the
subject is presented in a wily entirely
new to those who have not heard him
for four years. To those who have
never heard Jacob Riis. his tall: will
be a revelation of truth,

Mr. Riis started active liie in this
country as a police reporter on a New
York paper and there got his first in-
ﬂuence in the direction which he has
progressed further than any other
investigator in the land. After obs
serving conditions in the slums of the
city it came to his mind that it was
somebody‘s duty to ameliorate the
will circumstances in which children
of the lower districts were brought
up. He took up the work with a de.
termination to do good where it was
most needed. His labor has been un-
tlrlog and many of the great reforms
and institutions which make the slum
conditions of our cities many times
better than they were twenty years
are directly traceable to his eil‘orts.
Part of his success has been due to ills
fearless exposition of civic Vices. He
has published many books on the re»
sults of his Work. His lecture is fully
as interesting as his books.

There is nothing or the imaginary
in MLIH ’ lectures. He is telling
What he knows, for he is one of the
men who has “done something.”
