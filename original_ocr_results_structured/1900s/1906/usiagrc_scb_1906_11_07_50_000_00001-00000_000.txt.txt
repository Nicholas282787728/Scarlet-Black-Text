Miss Wilbur chose ior her subiecl.
the mooio oi ihe convention “11' ye
abide in me, and my words abide in
you.yemayask viliaL ye will, and ii.

and the real service of'

shall be done unto you.” Considered
merely as a promise wiilioub the con-

pnrboundless power into our hands,
yet if it could ha liberally carried out
would not the conﬂict; 0! Wishes which
would inevitably arise dissipate that
power? Unconditional Ilse of this
promise would be valueless, bubtllel'e
is an all-inclusive condition imposed—
“If ye abide in me and my words abide
in you."

The speaker devoted the body or
her address to the discussion of this
“abiding" in him, which she said
might be accompllsherl by the union
of three methodsiﬁrst, the Observr

Study oi Christ’s words, and lasbly by
communion with iiim through praycr.
We must keep the commandments be-
cause our abiding lullst be a conscious
ohm-r, not, merely an attitude oi mind.
We cannot Ll'easlll'e Christ's wards
unless we know and undersiand them,
and this rciiuires study. Finally,
Christ liilllselflmstaught us rho use
oi prayer ior truer communion with
God.
