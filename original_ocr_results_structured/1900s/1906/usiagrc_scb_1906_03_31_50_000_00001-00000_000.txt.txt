audience would hare been unbounded.

The mixture of music and fun, so
cleverly arranged and rendered in lasc
year‘s concert. was enrirely lacking.
The innovation of singing no encores
and or withholding the humorous
parts until the last could hardly be
termed salislactory. The element of
glee winch usually characterizes such
concerts and which makes them eu-
joyable was conspicuous by its ab-
sence. On the other hand, the audi-
