The class basket ball games which
are now being played iorrn a very inn-
portant part or Grinnell athletics.
The athletic management counts very
materially upon the proceeds from the
admissions to these games as they
i'orm an important source of income,
Basket ball is a good game to watch.
All the play is open and the simplicity
of the game makes it possible iorevery
one to understand it. Firty cents is a
very low ﬁgure at which to put the
price for ten games so that matter
should trouble no one. Let nothing
prevent your attendance at the class
games which begin alter Thanks-
giving. One other word is necessary,
however. In the enthusiasm for class
and the desire to see one’s team win
let not the real object of these games
be lost sight of. The aim in these
contests is to bring out varsity ma-
terial and to give it the beneﬁt or ex-
perience in real games. The best
possible Iowa College team is the big
thing in view and all spite orhard
feeling between classes should not be
allowed to adulterate the true spirit
which will mean the greatest good or
the varsity

We evidently were wrong in sug-
gesting the removal of the gauntlet DI
Water spouts across the library walks
for they still proudly occupy their old
positions, yet we cannot refrain from
pointing out another source or neglect
which at this time oiyear iseven more
dangerous to the physical welfare or
the student body. The conditioner
the steps or the various buildings dur-
ing snowy weather reminds one old
well greased toboggan slide with the
exception that the coasting is entirely
involuntary. It will require some
chart to orercome the trouble but the
frequent application oi the broom or
a sprinkling of salt or Cinders is
certainly lustined since it will help
prevent more or the dangerous kind oi
accidents such as the one which oc-
cured at the library yesterday.

Without a doubt the Ames rontball
team is an aggregation of wonders,
and we hesitate locriticiso their play-
ing ability, but we cannot admire the
lack oi reeling which they show ior
the athletic editor of their school pit
per. It is a severe disappointment to
see them fail to live up to his early
prediction or a loo to 0 score against
Grinnell. or course they could have
done soil they so desired (ircni an

PUBLIC SPEAKING PRIZES,
(Continued ham rirsi l’agei

shun) H. Hill and Rev. James L. Hill
set aside a sum of money for a prize in
public speaking. Later the amount
was increased to $1,400, so that now
540 is awarded to the winner oi the
ﬁrst place; $20 to the secnnd and $10 to
the third. The pr 9 is given for
“excellence in extempni‘aneous ad-
dress.” The founders believe that
public opinion was olten made by the
speaker. It was, therefore. their pur-
pose to establish “a contest that
would develop in college students the
ability to inﬂuence public opinion.”
So the speaking is always in the line
or an argument, an appeal or an ex-
hortation.” and is Judged according
to its ”effectiveness.” This contest
being extenuporztneous in character
does not admit oi special preparation.
One’s whole college course, and one's
attempt at speaking in the literary
societies should not only give one
ideas to present, but also the ability
to presenthis ideas effectively. This
contest completes in one way the
Work in the societies. From each of
four literary societies two representa-
tives are chosen. These eight meet
during commencement week and com-
pete for the prizes. Some time ago in
aletter to the President of the college,
Dr. James L. Hill summed up the
purpose of the prize by saying: ”The
Hill prizes are designed to be an in-
centil'e tn exteinpcraneous work all
through the college year."

2nd. Recognizing the importance
or debating and the great part extenu-
poraneous speaking should have there-
in, a prize in debating was established
in 15105 by the Hill brothers. This
prize consistes of a. gold honor ”G”
pin and is awarded to those who make
the intercollegiate debating teams.

HYDE mum.

The last prize in public speaking
presupposes that the student has a
deﬁnite message; and he wants to
give it to others; and he has mastered
the technique of speaking. r-lie elrort
to give the people his own thought in
an artistic form results in the oration.
The prize for the best English oration
was established by William Hyde. of
Ware, Mass. The lirst prize clean is
given to the competitor who presents
the .best English crittlon. account
being taken of the thought, of the
composition, and of the delli’ery. The
second prize $20, is similarly awarded
for Llle second best English oration.
Students are urged to select early in
the year special topics or ﬁelds [or
study. Those who Wish to enter tile
Hyde contest musthund their names
to the ploiessnr or public speaking be-
fore April 15th, lmtl their nl'zttions
must be ill belore the 31er of May.
The contestants will be chosen from
the literary societies, and the contest
will take place commencement week,”
