It. is becoming painful to remark
upon the persistanc indillerence oi
the spectawrs at football‘games to
the progress the team is making up or
down the ﬁeld. We are all interested,
or course, and want. bile varsity to win
always, but the lack of willingness to
show any enthusiasm is suddening.
Yellieadel‘s should not be needed to
arouse ll. body nf scudentswho lire fully
alive to the necessity or supporting a
team from the sidelines. The Very
suggestion that the Iowa College team
is playing ball under our very eyes
should bu enough to start a. cheer
which would make IL political rally
sound like a graveyard.
