An entirely exteinpovaneous pm'

with several very enjoyable musical
numbers After 2t piano solo by Miss
Jones, Miss Elizabeth Allen spoke on
the subject, ”Pianists, Past and Pres
ant.” some of the most dramatic and
interesting lives ever lived have been
those of musicians, usually poor, or
veering suddenly from poverty to
wealth and back again, irresponsible,
and fascinating,

Miss Allen treated her subject
from the more personal standpoint
rather than the technical and gave

many characteristic incidents from
the lives of a. few of the greatest pian-
ists. Miss Beth Ames followed with
a. talk on English artists in which she
compared the recent society of English
artists with the Royal Academy. Miss
Rachel Harris sang, “A Winter Lullar
