WILSON FOR PRESIDENT,

The Chier Executive or Princeton Univer-
siry is suggested as the Presidential
Nominee ror ipoa.

The suggestion of Woodrow Wilson.
president of Princeton University. as
the democratic candidate for president
in 1905, is receiving Very favorable
comments from the press and leading
thinkers and politicians at present.
The Iollowillg characterization of Mr.
Wilson. from Harper‘s Weekly, may
perhaps be or interest.

(1] Mr. Wilson is more than the ac.
complished scholar, the practical edu-
cator, the competent executive he has
proven himself to be: he is, in truth. it
statesman or breadth, depth, and ex-
ceptional sagacity. (2) He is an ideal-
iSC, yeti notably Stine. (3) He is a gen-
uine orator whose words ring true and
heal- conviction. (4) He stands for CV7
erything that is sound and progressive.
(al He holds the respect or everyone
with whom he has come in Contact,
and the admiration. especially. of the
college bred men. to) His ﬁdelity to
the interests oithe whole people is as
unquestioned as his integrit . ,
represents no class, no creed,an hob-
by, no vain imaginings. to) no is at
the inllness or his power in age and
experience. (9) He has profound con»
victions from instinct and learning
and the courage of fearless expression.
(10) He has no enemies, his is a clean
slate, (1!) He possesses. to a degree
unequalled since the days 0! Elaine,
that indeﬁnable quality known as per»
Sonal magnetism. (12) He is not. only
high minded but strong minded. (13)
He was born in Virginia. and hails
from New Jersey. His nomination
would be a recogni'. tion of the South
which Lhe South nobly deserves His
election would be an everlasting pledge
oiacountry united in (act, in deter-
mination Lo Sol\eall besetting prob»
lems, in inspiration to iullil America’s

CHAPEL TALK.

Dr. Sleiner Explains the Attitude We
Should Take Toward an Art We
Cannot Appreciate.

I’erllups the luckiest days of our
lives have been those when we were
introduced to certain people. Many
of the students of Iowa. College will
remember Friday, April (ith as one of
those days. when they were introdnc~
ed by Dr, Steiner to one oi the greatr
est Englisllmen,Robert Browning, We
Should noL criticise art like Brown-
ing's, Ilr. Steiner said, merely because
we do not lind anything in it that ap-
peals to us. We all enjoy the account
of “the Rakish Maiden in the Hay,”
andthe "Charge or the Light Brigade”
because Llley deal with things with
Whlcll we are familiar {Butnltliough
they are truly artistic, We mustl'e»
member that there are other kinds
Diart, Though We feel pretty high
on the top OI a. little hill We must not.
deny that there are mountains. Our
attitude should be, not to criticise
but enlarge our grasp.

Browning, Dr, Steiner Said may
sometimes seem barren itlmosblike a.
rough desert, but in the judgement of
strong: cultured men he never lacks

the element. of viril thought, and ex-
pression. All the circumstances of

his life were favorable for the produc»
tion or a great man. He was born in
an age of greatness, in the time of
Scott. Dickens, Thackey and Eliza-
beth Barrett. I-Ie inherited astrong
a strong mind and body and alove of
music. Even when achild he ran cry-
ing to the arms of his mother, over-
come by some music he had heard.
Iris feelings were strong. At 'ten
years or age he had fallen deeply in
love with a married woman iirteen
years his senior and wrote bushels oi
verses to her. Thus at an early age
he passed through the inevir;
able “Mal do nciii.“ IIe w strongly
influenced by Shelby. Dr. .steiiier
read several typical passages irom one
of Btownlngs that works “Paracelsus,”
which is run or sentences one would
Iiketo store up in the memor such
as‘The earth changes like ahuman

Iace’ and “Death, who blobs 50 Bit
the lollieslof the world." We were

given it bit or explanation or the poem
"Pippa Passes." and ”Saul" Perhaps
[his sentence stands out as sample of
\lllztr. he read to us from “Pippa. Pass-
ei'." “All service
with God."

After hearing so many wondei-inl
words that we had left unnoticed, we
certainly agreed with ill: Steiner
when he Said there were many of the
great authors that were lonesome over

ranks the same

at tile Library. Sometimes ZI. girl is
seen reading for the love of it, but. the
boys are so busy with the questions of
reciprocity and the [mill that they
ﬁnd little time to devote to literal tire,
