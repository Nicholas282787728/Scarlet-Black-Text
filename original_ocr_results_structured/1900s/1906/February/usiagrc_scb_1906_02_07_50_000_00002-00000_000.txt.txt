Grinnell, Iowa, Wednesday, Feb. 7, rgot

@hituviui

IFE is only worth living when we
know how tolire. and lil'C as jD

ously as we know how,” so some phll'
DSpher has remarked. This remark
would hardly apply to G rinnell student
life as viewed by some friends of the
instillltion. It has often been said
that Grinnell students tulle life too
seriously. Studentlire to them is a
serious business and the majority are
here to work: Whether that he Lrue
Or not. It is a (act that the student
actlvltes Of Grinnell pass along with
a regularity, which at times becomes
painful. To quote the words or a re-
cent speaker, “There is not a ripple
on the Surface.” of course this is it
matter of gratiﬁcation t0 the [0nd
parents who send their Children to
Grinnell for a deﬁnite purpose, but at
the same time it is a cause for discon-
tenton the part of the students.
We would not speak lightlyot this
condition or in anyway attempt to in-
stltuteareform, for we realize that
the present demands requires the
close and persistent attention to your
work. We are only led to comment
from the fact that we frequently hear
remarks from students which indt
(late that they are not satisﬁed with
existing oonrlitions, and on consider-
atlon oi the question, we do not won-
dor that they are not satisﬁed. Grin-
nell student life as a whole lacks some-
thing; what it is, we are not prepared
to say. We {car there is a tendency to
units into cliques and crowds and to
associate only with those who we term
our friends. ltis only on rare occa-
sions, that the students come together
and unite to accomplish a common
end. This may be satisfactory to the
great majority but such a condition is
not productive of colle ge spi t;
neither is it attractive for the stu-
dents who are left Out in the cold.
Forthis reason discontent arises uhd
many are disappointed in Grill-
nell and its life. We are too self cen-
tered and too much engrossed in the
everlasting struggle to make a good

grade or to secure the favor or the in-
instructorsl At the same time.bear in
mind that we are only commenting on
these CODdi ons and that if the in-
di dual students are satisﬁed we have
no reason to complain. We only be-
lieve that there would be less discon-
tent and that agreaterspil-it oi unity
and fellowship would spring up, under
conditions which would pel'lnita little
more or jollity and good reeling in our

i‘:l‘ily x'liilent life.

BASKET BALL,

they will play Simpson this evening.
Little is known oi Simpson’s strength,
but a hard game is not anticipated. .\
return game will be il'alrd in the
Men's Gymnasium on Friday after-
noon, February 9. The Minnesota
trip which had been planned ior later
in the season has been given up. Lack
oiliinds and the great expense made
the trip inipractible. A suirlcienn
number oi games could not be soiled-

it. w. c. A. CANDY SALE, FEB. 13

Notices have been posted announce
ing a Y. W. candy sale Tuesday next,
and requesting that all wishing candy
in boxes sign up for the amount desir-
ed at the library desk. This candy is
to be made by the expert confection-
ers among the girls, and needs no fur-
(her recommendation to the Grinnell
students. Every one knows that we
are to have a new chapel and that the
Y. Wu 0. A. will need funds for fur-
nishing their new rooms. Tile pro-
ceeds or this sale are intended for this
purpose, and the purchases will be
placed in the Y. W. ofﬁce for the pres-
ent. We know of no valentine that
could be more acceptable than a box
of delicious home-made candy, and no
student should miss the opportunity
of a good investment by railing to sign
up at the library desk.

THE ALUMNI BANQUET.
[Continued [min lirsi pale]
These oﬂioers were unanimously elect-
ed for the coming year.

When the gathering broke up it
was with the general opinion that the
ﬁrst annual banquet of the Grinnell
Association 0! Iowa. College Alumni
had been an undreamed of success and
that the new organization, launched
under such auspicious circumstances,
would prove a thing or value both to
the graduates of the college and to
their alma mater, socially and mater-
ially. It is conﬁdently expected that
the annual banquet, to be held the
ﬁrst week in February will, with pass-
ing years, come to be more and more
an event looked forward too with keen
interest by local alumni as an occasion
for an enthusiastic and sincere out-
ward erpresslon oi the spirit and
ideals for which Iowa College stands
to those who know her bestiher sons

and daughters.
