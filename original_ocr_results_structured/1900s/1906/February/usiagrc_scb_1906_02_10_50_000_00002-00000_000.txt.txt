E desire to call the attention Of
our readers to the advertislng
columns of SCARLET AND BLACK. It
is an established fact that the ad Vera
tisers of SCARLET AND BLACK receive
the long end of the student trade.
This is a fact Which is not always 19'
preciaied by either advertisers orslu~
dent and yet past history clearly
proves the statement. Advertising
always pays and pays even in a college
paper, It is but right that the ad-
vertisers in student publications
should receive the college trade and
We believe that they do. » A special
feature of this department deserves
attention and thatis the local column.
The low rate makes it possible to
secure not only the best but the cheap-
est kind of advertising. People are
just beginning [0 realiae the results
which are obtainable through this
medium, and consequently our locals
have increased. The “Want Columns”
of our dailies are always a much read
department, inst so the locals oi
SCARLET AND Btlclr. Lost or Found,
For Sale or Exchange notices are sure
to attract the attention of the reading
public if placed in our local column.
Time and again our lccals have bcen
the means or making people happy.
Investigate this department; give it
a trial and you will become fully con-
Vinced. Get the habit.

The college authorities have been
rortunate in securing Rev. Barton,
