sickness is now post in most cases and
the new student begins to t' e a

to feel that life is room worth living
even at Grinnell. Now is the time [0
think about your literary work and to
make plans for doing something along
the society lines for Surely lulystudeut

is ollered in the college at the present
time. Of course, We have heard the
old story of not hnving time to do
literary work but any stuéellt whohus
not time for the society training will
ﬁnd that the world has not any time
for him when he comes up ngtinst the
cold realities of life. There is de-

friendship and commdesllip whichin
itself is a most valuable part ol 1 Cole

A spirit or reform has suept orcr

will now permit ten cuts a year from

The Glee Club men at Oberllli will

ed that the Grinuell Glee Club men
would not object to receiving some-
thing more than glory in return for
the time spent in prmtiee, etc,

After Friday morning‘s chapel talk,
the students in the rear ought to spare
the Dean the trouble of calling the
”gentlemen Of the southeast. section to
Older” as he was obliged to do several
times last ye at.

The pastor of the Pilgrim church,
llevelund, Writes that he would rathr
er have had the demonstrations of
that Friday morning than to be the
possessor of Roeliefeiler’s millions. We
can assure him that while the former
would not buy him mztny luxuries, yet
it was not ”tainted.” It was an ex-
pl'ession of love and gmtitnde, direct
from the norms,
