Alumni Address.

Mrs. Davidson of the class of
’78, who has become quite widely
known for her work in the study
of Literature, spoke to a large an.
dience of alumni and friends last
evening on the “Creative Art of
Fiction."

The speaker ﬁrst showed the
present inadequacy of university
causes, critical methods and or-
ganizations of technique and cone
structive principles in the novel
as compared with the elaborate
system and critical formulas gove
errring the drama. It is easy tor
one to achieve a momentary suc
cess in a story quite devoid of the
art that should constitute its liter-
ature. And yet story-telling is an
art, with laws and principles as
imperative and necessary itless
fully apprehended than those ot
the drama. One has only to refer
to the letters‘and unpublished pa~
pets of George Eliot, Balzac,
Scott or a dozen others to realize
how painfully and constantly
these great writers studied the
masters before them to grant the
laws of unity, theme, economy,
movement, etc. of the novel,

Passing to the materials of the
creative work of ﬁction, the speak—
er touched upon the difﬁculty of
judging the elcmentsof permanent
value in a novel and the frequent
transitoriness of popular approval.
As the four essentials to any work
ot ﬁction being worthy ot being
called art. she named theme, plot,
characters and setting,

The theme is the underlying es
sential of any work of art. Witlr
out defending the sorcalled "pup
pose-novel,” the speaker insisted
upon some vital message from art~
ist to public, some necessary and
impulsive thought, which she hap-
pilycallcdthe“hidden meaning of
art,"to which all the other ele-
ments are accessory, which con-

trols the whole work and without
which no worlr could command
otlrattcntion. Thiscentralthemc
is not to be stated in thesis-forms,
but is to be involved either in the
characters, or their relations or in
the sittings of the story.

in a very masterful way the
spealrer treated the subject of plot,
which she deﬁned as the “dramate
ic pl'csentallon" of the theme. It
is to be absoluteiy deﬁned and (ice
termined by them, no item in the
plot structure being justiﬁed ex
cept a logical outgrowth and ex-
pressions of it. One ofthefun-
damental principles of plot lies in
this selection of critical moments,
essential to the whole work and
determining all the phases ot subs
sequent action. Dmitri armada
and Silos [liar/Mr are great works
illustrating the handling of the
principles of selections by a mas-
ter artist. No chance device as
such is worthy ofa place as a mo~
tive, Action should be the result
of an inner and not of an outer
force. An inartistic use of acci~
dent as motive force is iound in
77m 1llﬂ7bwmm,‘ A just and admisr
sable use of it in 7:1: as heightens
ing the artistic effect without de-
stroying the integrity of charac-
ter motive. The climax is the
turning point of the whole action,
beyond which nothing may be inc
trodueed that is not an organic
result or what has preceded it.
say Gov/gr Treasury is a notable
failure to connect the catastrophe
organically with the character or
theme.

Characters are also accessory to
the theme, but must be studied
from real life. The measure oi
truth in an artist's creation is the
same as his insight into life. The
element ot setting is one most dif-
ﬁcult to handle altistically. It
must give tone, color and atmos-
phere to the whole work. with as
little direct statement and refer
once as possible.

Mrs. Davidson’s deﬁnition of
art is "the transferring of the ideas
of our imagination through visible
means to the imaginations of 0th
ers.” While devoting much of
her address to the analytical ele
ments of ﬁction, she insisted at the
end on interpretation before critr
icism, and the absolute necessity

 

ofa sympathetic awareness of the

 

artist's thcmc before a, just judge
nient can be made.

Theunusually latehour at which
the banquet adjourned before the
lecture was not only annoying as
keeping a large audience waiting
for forty minutes, but as cornpell»
ing the lecturer to omit several im-
portant and interesting items trom
her address, which the audience
would have enjoyed hearing.

The Promenade Concert.

One oi the most
events of commencement week, is
the promenade concert. Though
it threatened to rain and damp-
ened the spirits of those who had
looked forward to this event, it
proved almost an ideal evcning.
As in ancient times all roads led
to Rome. so now all roads seemed
to lead to the campus. People
came from every direction. Old
”grads" sat beside the youthtul
"preps," members of the faculty,
digniﬁed seniors and tricky freshe
men all sat together.

To the old ”grads” it brought
back memories of college days
gone by, it renewed their love tor-
their Alma Mater; while to the
present generation of students,rt
gave more spiritand love tor Iowa
College. It was a sort of connect»
ing link between graduates and
students, it made them feel some
relationship and interest in each
other.

The glee club occupied thestone
steps in front of Blair Hall, from
where they sang the college songs,
which never grow old, and espe~
cially on such an occasion; then,
too, they sang the lively. spicy
song, and did not fail to give a
partrng word oi advice to treslr
men. Mrs. Winslow's Soothing
Syrup was kindly recommended
to them.

The opening number was, “Vile
meet again tonight, boys,” fol-
lowed by other tarniliar songs.
Macartney sang, ”Massa’s in de
cold. cold ground," in his usual
pleasingway. "Ourcollegeisour
castle,” which was sung with gene
uinc feeling, was very appl'oprie
ately the closing number.

The concert left upon all a feel-
ing of love for Iowa College, of
love which can not die out. even in
atter years,ot a love which means
something and wili do something,

enjoyable,

 

Commencement Address.‘ '

To the gay measures of “The
Beautiful Galatca," played by the
Amphion Orchestra, the Senior
class, robed in cap and gown,
walked in stately procession down
the centre aisle of the church and
occupied the seats reserved for
them. Sixty-six strong they were
7the largest class ever graduated
in the history oi the college. -In
flont of them sat the trustees and
members of the faculty. who have
taithtully and patiently guided
their efforts during the past tour
years. Behind them were the rel—
atives, friends and alumni, who
are always interested in old Grin-
ncll's graduates, and who have
only good wishes and a God-speed
ior their tnturc.

In this, the culminating scene
of the year’s drama, the Senior
class was the pivotal point. In
them centered all the interest. to
wards them all eyes looked,
to them the speaker addressed
his words of wisdom. Commence-
ment exercises are a happy, yet
sad event in the life of the gradu~
ate, fora happy part ot his life is
gone forever, and he must say,
“Here cndeth the ﬁrst lesson.”

The program had been advere
tiscd to begin at 9:30 o’clock, but
owing to some accident which un-
avoidably detained PresMacLean,
the speaker of the occasion, the
program was slightly rearranged,
bringing some musical numbers at
the opening instead of at the close,
Attertheopening prayer,Pilgrim's
Chorus from “I Lombardi,"was
rendered by the Orchestra, and an
Offeitoire In D mirror was played
on the organ by Prof. Cole.

The main theme of President
MacLean's thought seemed to be
the proper relation of the church
college and the state university.
our public school systems. our
colleges, and our-state universities
should, in these days of industrial
and political cooperation, torm'a
confederation, of which thetstate
university, while not usurping in
any way the place of the school
and college, should, by virtue of
its facilities for specialization and
higher training, he the head or
heart. And the infancy of such a
confederation is clearly foreseen
in the state teachers’ associations
and national educational gather-
