CHANGES IN CHICAGO HALL.

During the Easter recess sever-
al changes were made in the places
Hall.
Owing to lack ofroonl Dean Main

of recitation In Chicago
has moved his ofﬁce from room lg
Noble
and Whitcomb will occupy as an
ofﬁce the room vacated by Dean
Main. Room 22. formerly used
by Prof. Nollcn has been ﬁtted up

as an ofﬁce for President Bradley

to room 23. Professors

who will arrive here April 22nd to

assume his duties. The president

will be in Grinnell for two weeks
and then will be gone for a short
time, returning about May l3th.
Miss Millertl will hold her recitar
tions the rest of the year in room
27 and Prof. Nollen will meet his
classes in room 30, vacated by
Miss Millard.

Until the arrival at Pres, Bradley
his ofﬁce will be used as a confer-
ence room by Dean Main, as the
two ofﬁces are connected by a
door. The locating of these two
oFﬁces together will be of great
convenience to the President and
the Dean, and although the
changes have occasioned some
coniusion among the students, the

new arrangement will no doubt‘

prove more satistactory than the
old.
