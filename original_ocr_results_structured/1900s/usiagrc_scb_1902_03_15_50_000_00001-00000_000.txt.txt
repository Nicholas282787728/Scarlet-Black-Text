Gymnasium Team Competes at Madison
March 12. in Second Contest at
Marshalitown March 17.

Monday afternoon at4:t5 o'clock
the third annual gymnasium exhi-
bition will take place. A greater
interest attaches to the exhibition
this year than to preceding ones,
for on the showing made will de»
pend the ﬁnal selection of the men
who are to go to Madison. The
exhibition will consist of work on
the horizontal and parallel bars,

‘ rings, horses, pyramid building,
tumbling and club swinging. A
special feature will be the spring-
board tumbling by a team of high
school boys. Last but not least
will be thegame between-the town
and college basketball teams. In a
practice game a short time ago the
’Varsity beat the town team by the
narrow margin of 35 to 34. The
game Monday willheanotherclose
one, and the team that wins will
have to play good ball.

The ﬁrst Western Intercollegi-
ate Gymnasium Meet will be held
at Madison March 22. This is a
new venture in western athletics
and lowa College is the only insti-
tution in the state which received
an invitation io participate. A
team of tour or ﬁve men will be
sent. Its personnel will not be
deﬁnitely decided until after Mon-
day's exhibition, but it will prob—
ably be chosen from the following
list: Walleser(captain),Burnside,
Parks, Harvey, Saylcs, Davis, LR.
Marsh and C. G. Benson, The
contest will consist of tumbling
and work on the horses,rings, par-
allel and horizontal bars. lri addi—
tion, Burnside will do some exhi-
bition club swinging.

No forecast of the outcome of
the meet can be made at this time.
Our men will be under the dis-
advantage ot competing with men
from runiversities like Chicago,
Michigan and Minnesota, which
have possessed gymnasiums for
many years. But whatever the re-
sult Director Davis says the men
sent from here will reﬂect no dis-
credit on the college, They are
doing good work, and some of it
will compare favorably with that
done in the eastern schools.

The last meet in which our team
will take part will be held at Mar-
shalltown March 27th under the
auspices otthe Y. M. c. A. oi that
place. Tile team sent there will
be about twice as large as the one
that goes to Madison,

the year, and later by formal
notice, invitations were sent out
asking for contributions from any
one who might wish to hand in

Brilliant successeColonial Filled by
Enthusiastic Audience.

Sioux Falls, 5. D, the Siayton
Grand Concert Company arrived
in Grinnell last eveningjust in time
to keep their engagement at this
place. A tull house greeted them
at the Colonial and their enthusi-
astic applause for each number
gave amp e proot of the high iavor
with which their efforts were re-
ceivéd,

Both Mme. Linda and Mr, Car-
berry were afﬂicted with bad
throats. resulting from exposure to
the bad weather. Consideringthe
physical fatigue the party was suf-
fering from, their performances
were truly remarkable. Grinnell
audiences, traditionally conserva-
tive, warmed to them at once and
each number was encored enthusi-
astically.

Mme. Rosa Linde tully came up
to. if not surpassing the expecta-
tionsthatwe‘re raised tor her. Her
magniﬁcent voice displayed all its
breadth and volume;hertechnique
was most perfect and withal'was
combined a sweetness and purity
most charming to her hearers.

Miss Georgia Bentley, although
entirely unknown to her audience,
had a warm place in their hearts
assured her, owing to her connec-
tion as a student with Mine.
Bloomﬁeld-Zeisler, but hercharm-
ing personality and perfect rendi-
tion made tier appearance the oc-
casion or a complete capture or
the entire assemblage, and her ef-
forts were received with an atten»

tion and appreciation most grati-
fying to a true artist. She is an
accomplished pianists and gives
evidence of a rare musical instinct
in her artistic interpretations.

Mr. Frederick Carberry has been
heard in Grinilell before. His
work here has placed him among
the ﬁrst of the_emlnent tenors and
last night's efforts fully sustained
him in his position, His voice is
wonderiuily rich and pure and has
a sweetness and depth at feeling
which casts a spell over all who
hear him. He is an artist who is
always sure of a hearty welcome.

Although the last to receive
mention. Mr. Paul c. Beebe is by
no means the least in the scale of
excellence. His performance on
the violon-cello was most master»
