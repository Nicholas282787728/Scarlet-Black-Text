COE IS DEFEATE .

Our First Game thh the Presbyterians

R ults Diszst ously for Them

The defeat of Coe by the de-
cisive score of 20 to 0 on Satur-
day last is a very encouraging be-
ginning for our varsity, The game
was won by hard, straight foot»
ball, unmarrcd by a slngle Fluke.
When the short halves, ﬁfteen
minutes, and tlle earllness in the
season are considered. the score
seems eminently satisfactory. At
no timewasthe game in doubt.
the play being in Coe’s territory
throughout both halves. The
teams were nearly matched
in weight, but Grinnell's superior-
ityin both offense and defense
was marked, lack Watson sus-
tained his reputation as trainei,
not a man being taken out lorany
cause.

Coe won the toss and chose the
ball. Grinnell licked off, secured
the ball, and pushed steadily

down the ﬁeld, Robinson being
sent around the end for a touch
down within ﬁve minutes of play.

Gilley missed goal. On the next
kick-off Coe again chose the ball.
We held for downs. Grinnell
worked it toward Coe's goal,
sending Robinson over forthe sec
ond touch-down and Gilley missed
goal, When time was called at
the end of this half, Grinnell had
the ball on Coe‘s iour yaid line.
This probably would have (lcvclr
oped into another scoie. Coe
lucked off at the beginning of the
second half, when Atlrachcr made
a pretty retuin through almost the
entire Coe team. The rest oi the
half was but a repetition of the
ﬁrst half. Robinson scored two
touchdowns, and Doran missed
both goals.

Rohlnson wasthe most consis-
tant ground gainer ofthe
though his laurels were shared
with the other backs. His gains
weie made possible by tnemagnh
ﬁcent interference of Carson and
Gilley. In the line Handel, who
hashadthe misfortune of being
injured at Gilmanwhiie returning
home. and will not get into the
game again until the Iowa game,
at least.—-was the star of the
several men, time and again
breaking ofplays, making holes
in the Coe line whenever required
The game was played upon a
muddy ﬁeld, when Grinnell‘s
speed could not show what possi-
bilities it may have.

By takingjadvantage of thenew
rule which givesthe team scored

diy,

 

upon the choice of the kick oif
Coe prtibablykept down the score
This demonstrated the bent‘ﬁl a
weak leam obtains the
change of rules. No quarter
back runs were tried. The rule
requiring seven men in the line of
scrimage within
yaid lines, will naturally assist
our light teamthis year, by pre-
ventingtheexhaustingmassplays,
such as were down our defense in
the Minnesota and Drake games
oflast season. This same rule,
applied to offense. will of‘icr an
opportunity for fast. snappy end
runs, where our speed and condi-
tion will tell. The quarterback
rule will. as it now appears, effect
tls but little.

one orto diminish the attendance,
but that the attendance at all oi

THE INTER-COLLEGIATE PROHIs
BITioN ASSOCIATION.

Something About the New Society Which
Has Been Organized Heie

There has probably been no
college movement in the country
which has had such a rapid and
extensive growth as the Inter»
collegiate Prohibition Associa-
tion.

Built up largely in the lasbfour
years there are now active Prohibi-
tion Leagues in most of the col-
leges of the northern states. In
some states from a fourth to a
third of all the college men of
the entire state are enrolled.

The object of the association is
to promote a broad study and dis-
cussion of the questions arising
from or connected with the liquor
trafﬁc, to advance the principle
of prohibition and secure the pars
iicipation of college men and woe
men in this reform.

Tuesday night a league was
formed here and the purpose isto
hold meetings once in two weeks
at each of which there will be a
dlscussion of different phases of
the liquor problem. following the
outline of topics furnished in the
“College Cltlzcn," the organ of
the national association. In it
three or follr topics are suggested
for each meeting, references are
given to books for material and
different members are assigned
these topics for reading and pre-
paration of ieports to be given at
the meetings. These repolts will
be followed by informal disr
cusslons and the purpose is, with-
out talting a greatamount of time.
to familiarize the members with
the most important facts on the
liquor question. This year a
special study will be made of the
methods ofdealing wlththe liquor
trafﬁc and to some extent of the
political and economic aspects of
the problem.

An interesting featuic of the
movement is the system of inter
collegiate oratorical contests. It
is_ planned to hold a local contest
in February with orations on some
phase or prohibition, the winner
of which will go to the state con-
test to be held at Cornell college
in April, at which cash prizes will
be given. The winner of the state
contest represents the state in an
inter-state contest and ﬁnally the
the winners of the three inter-
state contests for two years meet
in a grand national every second
year making the largest oratorical

.competition in the country.
