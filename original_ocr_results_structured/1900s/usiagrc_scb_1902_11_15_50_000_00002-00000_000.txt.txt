as long as such a spirit reigns

Nov, :5, Ion:

at Minnesota as has been
shown this year Grinnell will win
few games with the University.
There were days when Grinnell
had the spirit and Minnesota had
the numbers and weight. but with
the spirit Minnesota has shown
this year she will always rank
among the strongest schools in
intercollegiate athletics. After
herﬁrstfewgamesthe University’s
prospect for a successful season
was very poor, but the enthusiasm
and support of students and team
has put Minnesota in the race for
the championship. No one can
help admiring such spirit. The
Minnesota Daily, in the darkest
time, just after the defeat by Ne-
brasla, devoted whole pages in
every issue to calls for support
and the students responded nobly.
Look and learn. Grinnell has no
right to be discouraged when de-
feated by ateam with such sup-
port. But the lesson ot clear grit
when the team had taken a slump
may he learned by all,

will be the trying time for
the coach and trainer, This IS
the time when there is an almost
uncontrollable tendency for the
men to let up. But just now is
when every man should be out on
time every night for practice.
Grinnell can ﬁnish a good season
in many respects yet and all tootr
ball men should help do it by
faithful work to the very last.

MASS MEETING.

Harris, evinced the same llvcly
interest in the team and school as
of old. After music by the band
the meeting adjourned to re
assemble this afternoon at Ward
Field. Before this reaches our
readers the game will be a matter
of history but whatever the result
of the score one thing is assured.
Grinnell will have attained the
great object of all student cntcr»
prises, the enthusiastic and con-
certed union of the school in an
action in which all are interested.
