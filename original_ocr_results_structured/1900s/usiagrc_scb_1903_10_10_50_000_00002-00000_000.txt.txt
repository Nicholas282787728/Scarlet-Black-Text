OBODY doubts but that the
chiet source or personal
proﬁt in a college course is in the
association it gives the student
with men whose lives radiate an
uplifting inﬂuence. This is the
kind of men who have gathered
around the standards at Iowa Col-
lege as its faculty. and it is the
kind of a man who is now making
abriefsojaurn among us in the
interests of Christian work. ProA
tessorBosworth'svisithere affords
additional opportunity for what
we may call for lack of a better
phrase. development 'by absorp-
tion. No one who has heard him
will need to he told the meaning

of it.

WE WON THE DOUBLES.

Wilder, '06, returned from
Ames this morning with the gratie
tying report that our team had
won the doubles in the dual tour-
nament. although we lost the
singles. No details of the en-
counter are available at the time
we go to press. The return meet
will be held in Grinnell some
time next spring, date to be deﬁ-
nately settled later.
