FROM DR P. E. SOMEksi'ge.

A number of messages have
oometo me trom Alumni during
the last two or lllrct: weeks, re~
gal'ding the Grinncll football team
of 1903 and the universal ev-
pression in them has been one of
satlsraction anti Iii-idem onrtcani's
it and grit. Willi largely in
experienced men the has
played consistently against heavi~
erantl more L’xpellellced teams

any game. Perhaps a game en-
joyed nearly as much as some of
the victories this fall, was the out
played against Ames. In that
game against 0 v e I‘\\ h elm i ng
weight and strenglh. our team

fought with desperation every

minute and though buried by a
score of 4176, left no chance for
complaint or condemnation from
Grinuell enthusiasts. If Grinnell
is to continue playing such heavy
schedules with lalger schools, her
supporters must learn -the lesson
that it is not all to win. TlllL‘
sportsmanship glories not
victories alone but in games last
well, if lost after such
glorious displays or team
and individual efforts as we
have seen in Guinnell this fall
We expect eaeh new Grinnell
team to develop tlte same char-
acteristics even it made up of it
new men, But after a season like
this one Gl‘innellites cannot help
hoping that every member- of this
year's team maybe with us again
next year.

ill

as

Mention of this;ear‘s football
season would be incomplete with»
otittiibute to manager Crowley
Cole's conscientious work and
eareinl management. And oi
course the value of \Vatson’s
wort- lias;oeeonie so well known
that we almost take it forgrautetl.
Certainly a season with so few in
juries and the substitution of only
one or two men for injuries in
games during the whole season
speaks volumes for the system oi
training Gl'innell gets undel him.

P. E. SOMERS.
