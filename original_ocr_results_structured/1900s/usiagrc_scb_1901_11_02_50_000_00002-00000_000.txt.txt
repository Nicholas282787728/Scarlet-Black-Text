SemiJVQekly News

®N next Friday aitetnoon at
‘ Ward Field occurs the
game with Simpson,—the only
game scheduled tor the home
grounds. The Methodist boys
are coming prepared to win, and
are planning to bring a large deler
gation ot sympathetic rooters,ivho
are tull to overﬂowing with enthu-
siasm for their team, Simpson
has brolren in upon the iancied
security oi the “big tour" in a ivay
that is remailable to say the
least, and she well knows that a
victory over Grinnell will place
her in the (rent rank in this state.
To win this‘ victory she will put
up the hardest ﬁght oi the season.
She will contest every inch oi the
ground until time is called. The
interesting‘ question to Grinnell is
whether or not Simpson can carry
'out her intentions. The answer
o this rests'entireiy with the
udents. Unless we suddenly de.
velop considerably more genuine
enthusiasm, than s'eems to per
vade the college at present, it'is
quite possible that Simpson will
make good her intention. What
is absolutely necessary for this
gameaand for the other games
of the season, too, for that mat-
ten—is a revival of the spirit

which prevailed when Grinnell was
the recognized champion of the
state. Without this spirit the
game is lost; with it, there is a
chance oi winning.

HARGES of professionalism
seem to bespecially rile dul~
ing these baliny Indian summer
days. Captain Williams, oi town,
was debaried from the Minnesota
game, and is still resting underthe
shadow, because ot the charge
against him that he had played
professional baseball. under an as
sumed name. And now comes
the charge that Mueller, the iam-
ous right guard on the Minnesota
team, has violated the rules otthc
conterence colleges, bv partici-
pating in a Fourth ot July race,
in which he won a purse oi ﬁve
dollars. No ofﬁcial protest has
yet been entered, but the charges
are of a serious nature. and if sub-
staniiated will no doubt disqualiiy
Mueller {mm the team.

CHRESTO-ELLIS.

At the same time as the 1906

room. For a time the room was
lighted only by jaelelantcrns
whose subdued light added to the
fun of "Ruth and Jacob.”

Each person was then supplied
with a list of questions; the an
swel’ing oi these caused much
scratching of heads, and the read-
ing of the ansuers inucli laughter.
