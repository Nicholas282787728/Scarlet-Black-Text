MODERN JOURNALISM.

Lecture by Samuel strauss or Des
Monies

Another number in the series of
practical talks on great businesses
was given last evening in the col-
lege chapel. The stibject was
“Modern Journalism";the speaker.
Mr. Samuel Strauss ot the Des
Moines Register and Leader.

Mr. Strauss began his talk with
a description of tlte modcrn metro-
politan newspaper ofﬁce; the tele-
graph room where the news is re.
ceived, the editorial room, the
press room, and ﬁnally the mails
ing of the papers. The newspaper
asit exists today rs of conrpar-a.
tively recent development. The
art oi printing inane practically
no advance {or tour hrrndred years
after its discovery. The modern
daily springs lrcnr
lsloc's printing press invcntcd in
i853. James Gordon Bennett,
father of the present Bennett was
the Frrst to realize its importance
with and Mcrgcntltalcrs linotype
machine tor mechanical type set
t'ng it gave the physical possibil-
ity ol the modern daily. This
brings us down to 1530.

In 1386 the battle of Maluba
Hill was reported in the New
York Herald in six lines. In 1902
asimilar event in Sotltll Africa
was illustrated and reported as
tully as though rt had occurred in
the United states. Tile possibility
at this is due to the decrease in
cost of producing the paper and
the increased revenue from the
development of advertising.

Having described the pro
duction ot a newspaper and traced
its evolution Mr. Strauss next dis
cussed ioulnallsm as a protession.
If one desires to be successful in
the ordinary acceptance of the
term he should let it alone, Brit
it he has the newspaper instinct;
if he wishes to llVC in and for his
work there is no more attractive
or fascinating occupation.

Mr,Strauss hasa warm place

in the hearts of Grinnell autli-
enccs. No speaker who comes
to Grinnell is listened to with
more pleasure than he. His talk
.last night while of a different nae
ture than his previous addresses
here was fully as interesting and
instructive, audit is to be regretted
that the duties of the students
prevented a larger attendance.

COLLEGE MEN WIN.

Defeat High School Nine in Rather
Ragged Game by Score of to to s.

MnrshalltownTinics necrruircan,
Grinnell College won from the
the

local high school nine at

Finkle Park diamond Saturday
atter-noon in a rathcrraggcd'gamc
by a score of to to 6. While the
home team hardly expected to
win, it would have come nearer
doing so had it played the game
it is capable oi puttingup. Grin-
nell's victory, and cspccially the
manner iii which it was attaincd,
was of but little credit, Superior
helding and battingon the college
men's part won the game, the
home team at trmes when most
wanted being especially weak in
these particulars.

It t'cqnii’cd two innings for licnt
to settle down to his customary
form, and during that time he was
lztndctl on for ice salt: lllL
two passes to ﬁrst, which, ass died
by a wild pitch and a ct
errors, resulted in
the plate, Again, in the -th,
the wcarcrs of the scarlet and
black got a sale, two ttllobaggcrs,
materially aided by errors, giving
them it bunch of four. Another
one by ct'l'ors tn the eighth, tells
the story of the visitor's tally

Up to the fourth inning the
locals knew ofhome only as an
object to be attained, but in their
turn that timeatimely two-baggcr

full, sent two home and started

the crowd had been cleared back
from the b' 'c lines and the dust
hadsetrled. two more scarnpercd

which Mattin failed to connect
wrth. An error, a sacriﬁce, and
a sale one to center. put another
along stde llle quartet iii the ﬁfth,
and more errors, with a base on
balls, made the sixth and last in

oftlic best of it in the pitching
game, getting eight strrke outs
and one bztsc on balls. He was
hit for safes three times, andtwicc
tor two base hits. Kentgotsevcn
