TUDENTS will ﬁnd it well
worth while to attend the

state meet at Des Moines next
Friday. Tile meet, this year, is

is'an iin-

ot unusual importance. and, lrom
the fact that the lending teams are
so nearly equal in strength. it will
be of extraordinary interest. In
fact it is likely to prove more in-
teresting and exerting to the spec-
tators than any meet that has ever-
been held in the state. This. and
the fact that the Grinnell team
needs the vigorous support of a
large number of rooters, make it
imperative that as many as earl
should be on hand next Friday.
We make no claims as to the out
come of the meet, but whether
Grinnell wins or not, our delega
tion should be as large and enthus-
iastic as possible. '

glad to announce that, at
the
board of the Inter-scholastic Athe

school buildingsaturday morning,
it was unanimously decided to hold

Statement From Y. M. C. A.

We desire to call the attention
of the College and senior Acadr
emy students to the Bible classes
for next year. Too much emr
phasis cannot be placed on the
systematic daily study of the
bible by the college student. It
is of great importance in develnpr
ing the lrie ot the irldividual. help-
ing him to obtain a truer concepr
tion of the fundamental principles
of life. Then. no education is
complete without a thorough
knowledge at the bible. It has
contributed more toward the de
velopment of the English lane
guage than any other-book. Reir
erences to it are found tlrrougllr
out the realm of literature.

The bible courses next year
will be conducted under the same
system as tlrrs year’s. Student
leaders will be provided. The
ﬁrst year's course is a study of the
life and teachings of Christ, giving
especialernph rstothcleaehings
and their hearings on modern
problems. Studies in the life of
Christ, by Sherman will be used.

The second year’s course is a
study oi the Acts and Epistles.
It is intended for those who have
completed the First year’s work

If there is suFﬁcient'dcniand a
third yeai course will be offered
in the old Testament. It is the
intention to do the work as carer
fully and systematically as p05

siblc. and we trust that a large
nurnberot students may take Liti-
vantage of the work.

The committee expect to make
a canvass of students during this
term and anyone desiring to enter
the classes next year will confer a
tavor,by handing his name to the
president of the Association or
any menrberot the Bible study
committee.
