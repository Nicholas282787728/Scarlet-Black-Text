Mrs, Beecher and Glenn Hall.

The next entettainment of the
Y. M. C. A. course is one that
merits the liberal patronage of the
people oi Grinnell. The program
will be or a high grade, but at the
same time of a popular nature,
and with a pleasing variety.

Mrs. Beecher is a woman of
national reputation in her line.
The Lectule Committee secured
her for the reason that Grinnell
audiences have heard few readers
of merit, and because Mrs.
Beecher, so far as collld be learns

‘cd. is as ﬁne a one as is now
available in the country. The
management oi the Midland
Chautauqua, of Des Moines, have
recently annonnced her as one of
their star attractions for the come
ing season. A number ot ourstus
dents have had the opportunity of
hearing her in past years at the
Spirit Lake Chautauqua and they
speak with great enthusiasm of
the excellence of her work. Of
her appearance at the Waterloo
Chautauqua Assembly, Supt. F,
J. Sessions says:7“We have never
had a reader on our platform that
began to compare with Mrs.
Beecher in artistic and popular
delineation of the characters re-
presented in readings alidrecitals.
I believe her to be one of the few
great readers of the country.“

Glenn Hall is ayoung tenor.
whose success has been unusual.
He has studied with some of the
best teachers of this country. and
with George Henschel in London,
and is now employed as teacher
of singing at the American Con-
servatory, ot Chicago, His voice

 

is spoken oi as one of unusual
clearness and sweetness, and
whenever he appears he proves a
favorite with the audience,
Though a less experienced singer-
than Cliailes \V. Clark. he has
sung on programs in Chicago
with Mr. Clark; he had a solo part
with the Apollo Club, of Chicago,
in their rendition of "The McsA
siah” a year ago; he has sung with
the Pittshlilg Symphony Orches-
trzl. with-the Arion Club, of Mil-
waukee; and has been favorably
received in many oi the cities of
this country and in London. His
appearance here with Mrs.Beecher
is by special arrangement or the
Lecture Committee.

Mr, Geo. R. Kurtz, who comes
as Mr, Hall's accompanist, will ale
so furnish an organ number. The
full program of the entertainment
will be announced in the next
issue of SCARLET AND BLACK.

VEuterhé Club Will Appear in the
Home Concert.

Considering the {act that the
Euterpt Club is in its ﬁrst year oi
existence and had to overcome
the many diﬁﬁculties always inci-
dental to newly organized illusi-
chl clubs.its progressand improve.
ment have been very good. Hav-
ing no traditions or past experi-
ence to draw lrom, and no older
members to give it support, the
twenty tour young ladies under
Mrs. Cole’s directorship had to
begin at the bottom and lealn the
lessons, which in a club or longer
standing are rather absorbed than
learned by‘new members. lnone
respect, however, they have an
advantage over the Glee Club.
Nearly every girl learns to read
music to a greater or less extent,
while probably the average boy
does not. This naturally allows
more rapid progress in acquiring
new music.

No deﬁnite plans were develop-
ed last fall as to just what the
Club would do. Of course it was
decided to give a public performs
ance of some kind somewhere;
butjust how was not ﬁnally do
termined until last week. At that
time it was decided that thc Cltib
should be given a place in the ans
nual Home Concert, March 8.

This will be a good arranges
men: all around. The Euterpe

 

Club will have its wished for op»
portunity;the program will ple-
sent a new teature;and tor the ﬁrst
timea tull representation ot all
the musical departments, both
male and lcmale, will appear in
one evening. The program will
certainly be a very attractive one.

As the concert is less than a
month distant, the ﬁnal touches
are being added. The Euterpe
Chrb practices regularly three
times a week, and Prof. Cole has
taken charge of the Glee Club.
Tire Amphion Orchestra never
played more difﬁicult music in
better style. From all sources
indications point to a very success-

ful concert.

Visitation of High Schools.

About four years ago a com mite

ers'Association for the purpose of

of which Iowa College is one. are

This year for the ﬁrst time, Iowa
College has taken an active part
in the work at the committee and
has sent out men to examine
schools. schoolsareapportioned
among the committee, and. if a
school makes an application to be
examined. preparatory to being
accredited, sometime before the
date of the committee meeting,
one of the examiners drops in on
the high school unexpectedly and
