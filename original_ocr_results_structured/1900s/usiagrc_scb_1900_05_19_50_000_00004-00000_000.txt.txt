Minnesota. 7; Gi-innerr, 5.
the weather ’l'hnrstlay was a tiisap»
iiointntent, and caused what would

have otherwise been one ol the hest‘

games of the year. to become It
rather loosely played exhibition.
The game started oﬁ well and for the
ﬁrst four innings was a pretty exhibi-
tion, when the ball becnme wet and
muddy and both teams went to pieces.

Thielnian, for the visitors, threw a

good game in Spite ol the diﬁicnlties, i
and was well Supported, the Minnesota’

ourlielil being last and sure.

The tirst inning started 00' in good
shape for Grinnell,the Minnesota men
going out in one, two, three order in
their half, giving Lindsay two assists
and a put-out. For Grinnell “Adam”
Fisk sent a warm one down to third,
which the third baseman was unable
to take care of,
and errors, charged up to Minnesota,
Fiske scored and was tollowed by
Clark and Doc, which completed the
scoring for the ﬁrst inning. Both
teams scored in the second, but the
third was unproductive for either side.

in the fourth, Minnesota took a
brace and landed on the ball for some
good long hits, succeeding in bringing
three men over the plate and tying
the score. At this point the rairt bee
gan but was not heavy enough to stop
the game. and from this on to the
eighth the scoring was due mainly to
errors and bases on balls, making the
score at the end of the seventh, 7-5, in
Minnesota’s favor. In the ﬁrst half of

By good stick work »

{Minnesotzn but the game was called
