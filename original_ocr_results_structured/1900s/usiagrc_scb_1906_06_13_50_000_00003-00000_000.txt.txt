but in the approach toward Iowa Col~

the crises and her future is assuredly

rious. We hare long needed one to
lead her to the glory of success and at

President Main l\ill not lead the “ﬂy

all lhat belongs to it is behind him.

For lhe ~tudenis .Ianria, 'ui, was a
highly pie n; and sutisiactoi-y repre~
sontaril'e. lie pointed out that Mr.
Slain is president not of the faculty,
not Of the alumni, not of the trustees.
but of Iowa College as represented by
her students. The bond between the
student body and their president is
marked, He is Siriug hislile for their)

sacriﬁce with honor and loyal eilorl.
As students We honor Presulent Main
on account of his devotion Lo dirty and
his slricer ve respect hiln because

is our friend.

Each of these speeches was radiant

with enthusiasm and loyal apprecia-

tion of our president. The love of all

Dr. Biadr'

the college was expressed sincerely and
respectfully by representative iiieri oi
all the college's connections and el cry
speech tinglcd wrth gratitude for
what President )llin has done for us
in ihe past and loyalty
shall do in the future:

After [he Glee Club, in its erer
pleasing way, had sung asacred melody
arranged by Prof. Smith, the new
president whs formally installed by
Dr. Clark, who gave the trust to its
new keeper in a few simple and cries-
t c words of profound belief in his
ability to safely keep it. The trust
was accepted impressively by President
Main, who, after a prayer by Rev.
Adams, our oldest lriend, geve his
inaugural address. Butasmall and
incomplete idea or its magniﬁcence
and allrelllbracmg comprehensiveness
can be gireu here. It presented an
indescribable charm and inspiration
which attracted and held theaudience.

Among other things he asserted
that (nu-institution cannever advance
in the spiritoi sympathy and ldeallty.
These have been set at their utmost
limit by the founders or the college.
However. we do bore a challenge to
service in the building up and perrect»
in}; of our educational machine. Al-
ihougli unchaiigeable, we must have
our idealsin mind. They are genu-
iuencss, i‘earlcssuess, concern iorliu-
man needs, comprehension. all or
which willingly has been sacriﬁced and
which have the immortality of eternal
)Olilh.

There are always criteria by which
a college is ludged. It must recognize
democracy, adequacy of equipment
and quality of teachers iIi ability and
sympathy. Iowa College can stand

and scrutiny
along these lines. but there are still
needs in our general outline of courses
which must be filled in as rapidly as
possible.

These are buta felt of the many
beautiful and excellent thoughts
which were a part or the president‘s
address.

for all he

llis never-fading genuine-
ness and sincerity were abundantly
manirest and not a soul feels but that
lowa College is in the hands or a man
whose ability and strength or charac-
ter will lead her on tortiulure even
more glorious than her resplendent

and successhil past.
