try. The practice has not fonnrl
much favor in Grinnell. owing to
the intermittent and irregular ac-
tion of the various classes and the
factional differences thereby enr
gendered. Opposition has been
further aroused in the past by the
spasmodic appearance at seveial
caps and gowns on all sorts of oc-
casions throughout the year; and
also by the refusal of certain re-
bellious recusants, for this reason,
to abide by the decision of the
class. The class of loot has wise-

THE FIRST football game of the
season occurs next Saturday after-
rioon. No ﬁtter opportunity could
be found than the present moment
for presenting a few thoughts,
which have been lingering in the
minds of the football management
for some time past. To»\\lit: the
Athletic Union needs the support
of every student, every alumnus
and every friend the college has
A large debt, contracted through
misfortune,mustberaised,andthat
raise can only be made through
the hearty support of the aforesaid
individuals. But particular at
tention is Called to a particular
feature ot the kind of support
asked for and expected. Let the
following words sink deep into the
minds or all readers. No business
man of Grinnell. alumnus or friend
of the college. will be asked to
make any ﬁnancial gifts for the
support ot tootbali this fall. No
student will be asked to subscribe
to a coach fund. The only kind
of support the football manage
ment asks foris agood and enthur
siastic attendance on the games.
This does not read like an unjust
proposition, but rather as a most
moderate expectation on the part
of the management. The ﬁrst op-
portunity for patriotism to show
itself comes next Saturday. A
large crowd ought to be present.

Y. M. C. A. Notes.
Perhaps in no aciivny ot life is
the need for systematic and dc»
votional Bible study so much felt
as In the college days of the aver»
age man.
It has been with a sense ot this

need and a desire to meet it that
it has been deemed best to in-
augurate the system of student
leaders based upon the tour year
cycle plan prepared by the Inter-
national committee of the Y. M.
C. A.

Out of 250 institutions repre
sented at the Lake Geneva con
ference in June. rooo. 95 per cent
had adopted the above system
with excellent lesults. The
classes will arrange hours ior
meeting and a plan of the work
will be given Sunday morning.

The ﬁrst year class will take up
a study in the lile of Christ based
upon a Harmony of the Gospels,
by Stevens and Burton and studies
in the life of Christ by Sherman.
The second year class will have
a course in Acts and Epistles.
This course presupposes the ﬁrst
year's work.

The next number on the pro-
gram was undoubtedly the most
interesting and instructive of the’
evening. To hear, of the early
days oi the society by one who
had helped to start it on its suc-
cessful career was indeed a treat.
Mr. J- P. Lyman brought with him
the early records of the society
and using these as a sort of text.
told of its early history, On mo-
rion Mr. Lyman was unanimously
made permanent custodian of the
society’s early records.

The society was then favored
with a very pleasing eornet solo‘
by Mr. Way. who kindly respond-
ed to a hearty encore. Mr. Way‘
was followed by extcmporaneous
work from Messrs. Hunting, Mes
Keag and Dickinson.

The program was closed by a
wellrrendered piano solo by Miss
