Rise During “B00111.”

In almost every school in the coun-
try, there is some song uith signiﬁ-
cance that it has become
customary for the student body when it

such
is heard, to rise. The genius has not
yet shown himseli who is to write
the real Grinliell song for which the
College has been so long waiting. but
until that happy tiulc arrives can we

gestion is a good one. it can on ’ he

The Council Constitution.

lege Council placed before the student
body for its consideration a constitur
tion for a new College Council, Scarlet
and Black attempted to point out the

recently submitted a new document
to the classes.

We feel that the new document is
far from perlect and that it contains
many provisions which might. better

hand, many of the most ﬂagrnnt abuses

The new constitution is the work of
a joint committee oi the classes and
as such probably expresses reasonably

accurately the sentiment of these

classes. In addition it is of immense

importance that a live, active council
be substituted for the present decrepit
organization, and that right soon. All
things considered, Grinnell College’s
best interests will he served if the
classes see ﬁt to adopt the constltntion
now submitted to them.
