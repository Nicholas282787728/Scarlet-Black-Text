TllE ELECTION of Dr. F. K. San-
ders to succeed President Gates
was announced this week. Scarr-
LET AND BLACK (eels tllat it
speaks for the students when it
commends the actlon of the Board
of Trustees iii th e i r selection.
While the students are not quali-
ﬂed to select a man tor president.
and their judgment in regard to
such a selection could be ques-
tioned. no one doubts butthat they
thoroughly appreciate the task
that was before the trusteesI to ﬁnd
a man to take up the work where
President Gates leaves it. The
trustees are conﬁdent that they
have at last found the man to do
it; and.trustingintheirjudgment,
the students are ready to extend
to Dr. Sanders a cordial welcome,
and hope that the same thorough
understanding now existing be-
tween them and President Gates
will continue after Dr. Sanders
takes up the work. Dr. Sanders
will have a difﬁcult task to follow
a man who is in such close touch
with the students here, and who is
held in such sincere esteem; but
he nlay feel conﬁdent that he will
be received and treated in the
same spiritthathas been accorded
to President Gates tor so long.
But it he can take that place and
ﬁll it as President Gates has ﬁlled
it, he will need no words of this
paper to assure him how he is re-
garded by the students. SCARLET
AND BLACK extends to Dr. Sanders
the hearty welcome ot the sine
dents oi Iowa College.

THE OUTLOOK for a winning
track team in Iowa College, during
the present school year, is quite
promising. In spite of the tact
that the weather of the past two
weeks has not heen the most on-

collraging, a tavorable number of
men have reported tor daily work.
To the most of these men, track
athletics is a new thing. Few of
them know for which events they
are ﬁtted, and it will require a great
deal of hard work to put them into
proper condition. A good track
team has always been one of the
essentials conducive to the success
of Iowa College athletics. This
branch ot College life, especially,
needs our assistance this y ear.
The State University has won the
annual state meet for the past two
years. it they succeed this year,
they will win the cup. The ques
tion which confronts every Iowa
College man is: “Are you going
to give every bit oi your athletic
ability to prevent the defeat ot
our track team, The success of
our team in the past has been due
to unanimity. To that it must be
due in the future. We have said
that the outlook for a winning
track team was quite promising.
This assertion depends upon one
condition. to-wit: That every man
capable ot taking part in track ath-
letics will do it. The team needs
more than the support ot your
goodwill—it needs a part of you.
It you are not playing tootball or
tennis, it is your tivoefold duty to
report for track work: you owe it
to your health; you owe it to your
college. Show your college spir-
it by reporting tor duty at mm.
It is only by the co-operation ot
every student that wc can hope tor
the return ot those days when an
Iowa College victory at the State
Meet was as certain as the coming
of daylight and darkness.

The Bible study committee
wishes to extend a cordial invitar
tionjto every new student to join
one of these classes. II. is hoped
that every christian man, new or-
old, will Considcl‘ it one of his
college privileges to aid in this
branch of Y. M. C. A. work.
Everyone will be more than \velr
conic to the classes.
