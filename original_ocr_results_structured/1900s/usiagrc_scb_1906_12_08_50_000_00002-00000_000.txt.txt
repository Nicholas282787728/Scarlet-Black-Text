Qﬁhitoriul

In times past when the question oi
abhleoic ideals has been under discus-
sion the case has usually been one per-
taining to the college as a whole. In
such cases the settlement has always
‘heen in favor of the right. At the
presenc Lime a question is up for set-
tlem entl which is going to establish a
.precedent lo! cases of class athletics.
and if the ideals 0! Iowa College nth-
lebics are going to be maintained at
their present high standard it is abso»
lately necessary that this case be set-
mlcd on a college basis,

It is a hard thing to say but withoub
c. doubc the place than the present
Sophomore class holds in the estima-
tion of the school is. to say the least.
‘far from enviable. although it is gen-
Qrally recognized ohah all of its recenc
needs were not. performed with the
sanction of all the class members.
‘There are Lwo reasons for complaint.

”Glass and the other upon the class as a
whole. Of the ﬁrst we propose to Say

lelm that she has in her student body
a group or men who exhibit so deplor-
able aspirit. The second reason must

in it lies the only salvation for the

slon, for she has allowed wrong action

will G! the class. She has shown her
true spirit once, however. and upon
that spirit she must stand ii she will
regain her position in the college.
The Sophomore clans now has a ﬁnal
opportunity L0 condemn the acclon o!
'chose who have deliberately misled
her. She must seize upon it and snow

honorable means” is he): standard.
She must do this for the good of IDWI
College and for her own good. The
‘ldee of “win all any cost, of honor and
‘j ustlw” has no place here and will'noc
‘ba tolerated. The precedent. which
would be established by allowing any
'Clasl to violam the traditions. ideals
and very rules or me insoicucion.
would be as bad as if this nation should
allow any one shape at the union to
‘pass a law admitting slavery. The
cases are exactly parallel.

Furthermore. the class cannot zi-
‘d’ordm tolerate Buch aspirit Within
itself. The idea of allowing a small
fflction to dominate the class actions

cos: the class may hope no mm in
college. Already the spirit. or dirty
politics has entered in to corrupt. class
manuals which Call (or honest and

must go.

The class should have the op-
vportnnity to right itself in tho eyes a!

more to its credit. The sentiment of
Lllecluss individually is against the
actions iili'cli have gone Llirougli in

gecller and lolra a right SLalld They
should be wrlhng to go to any lenngi
to regain tile position Which they dr-
serve. Ii necessary a renunciation Oi
all claims to past vchories which have
been unfairly won should be made.
Not that anyone else would leol great»

cause the class needs to do something
honorable.

Tile properstaud in chose matters
is the ching we look for from the
class and the clung which is necessary
to its Welfare as Well as that of the
Whole school. If ”naught. nine”
is to be “ﬁne” she must ﬁrst “get
square".

FRIDAY CHAPEL.

The students and visitors at Fri-
day morning’s clizlpel had the pleasure
or hearing a short address by liiss
Harris. Her remarks in substance
were as follows: Providences of God
are not always recognized as answers
to prayers buc those who some years
ago atasmall meeting near Pekin in
China prayed for the evangeiization
of the World have every reason to be-
lieve their prayars are being answer-
ed. Near ohab city some 20 years ago a
small band of missionaries mat. to-
getllerand prayed for the Christiani~
ration of the world and linked Lheir
hearts in a solinen vow co give their
earnest and strongest eirnrlscoward ac

iuiility of working by themselves.
They needed help. They lrnaw ll the
world was to be Christianizsd the
work must. be accomplished no more
by the missionary in cho deld than by
the active work at home of thought—
in] Ind earnest men and women A! a
result of this conclusion attention has
turned homewnrd and after some
earnest labor Lhastudent was interest-

lege men was called at Mt. Herman
near Norchﬁeld. at which 281 students
were present. representing sr colleges.

That, was the launching of the
Student’s Volunteer Movement of
which Miss Han-is is the ambitious
exponent and which throughout the
