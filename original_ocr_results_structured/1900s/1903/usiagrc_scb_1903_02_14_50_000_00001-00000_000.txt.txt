ENTR ANCE REQUIREMENTS.

The College Adopts the Credit Sysiem
Degree or Bachelor 0! Science
Proposed.

A radical change has heen rrradcl
in the entrance requirements oi;
Iowa College, by the adoption oil
thecrcdrts cm. Theeronrronoil
the new clrnrr- ol Botany has matte
it possible to ochr three
groups, in addition to those thcy
already have, making a total of
tourteen groups. The new sys
tem raises the standard for en-
trance to the two degrees oi
Bachelor of Art and Philosophy.
Solid Geometry and Plane Tug»
onomerty, which were formerly
given college credit, have been
placed _in the requirements, and
Chemistry and Botany, taken in
the high schools, will be given
credit. The _proposed degree of
Bachelor oi Science will only re-
quire (2) credits or two years of
Latin; while this lowers Ottristandr
ard somewhat, it will ﬁll a long
felt want, asa large number at
students. who desired ti science
course, did not ivtsli to take the

These changes wrll undoubtedly
be welcomed by a large iiunlbei
of irrcnds and prospective sine

uliuziual

The Calocagathian Society was
rounded duriiigthe dark days ot
the war when there were not men
enough in the college to ﬁll the
ofﬁces of a literary society, for
nearly all the college students at
Grinnell were in the ranks of the
Union army. Ever since this time
Calocagatllia his been a source of
growth and inspiration, one of its
marked characteristics being the
spirit of harmony and coopera-
tron among the members. The
girls' socreiics in the College otter
splendid opportunities to their
members of coming into intimate
relationship and contact with the
other women of the ir rrlutron in
a way that no other orgarrizrtinn
