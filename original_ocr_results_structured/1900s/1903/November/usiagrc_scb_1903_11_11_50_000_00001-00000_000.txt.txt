We Lose Another Hard Fought Battle7
The Team Played Nobiy.

Allies slipped a cog Saturtlay'
by taking a second consecutive
victory tron. Grinnell. Thestory
is one of beet and lack of speeilr
against a light line and fastbacks.
Any time a play was aimed at the
the Griniicll line it was sure to go
through, wiuleainrost as surely, a
Grinnell half made good gains
aroundtheAmesends. Thegalne
was not nearly so attended as the
score would indicate, In the ﬁrst
half Ames carried the ball 270
yards as compared to 240 forGrinr
nell, and yet the score was [7 0.
There was a remarkably small
amount at tumbling. each team

the ﬁeld three times in the ﬁrst
haltwith scarcely any rnrshaps.
The only difference was that
when Grinnell approached the

Robinson and Webb played
brilliant football on offense and
Shipman anti Van Liew shone on
delense. \Vebb railed only once
to remove Tellier from the path
of Robinson and when he carried
the bd” himself he was nearly all»
ways sure at a good gain. Robin-
son chle several very long runs
and played a star game through
out. Grinnell‘s only score cam:
in the second half after a forty-

fourth down brought only a few
inches from the goal but Ames
was held on the eight yard line

IOWA COLLEGE, GRlNNELL, IOWA, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER ll, l903.

PRESIDENT GEORGE 1N GRINNELL.

Some or the Thoughts Set Forth in Hrs
Addresses.

Sunday was the ﬁrst day of the
week of prayer and Ill accordance
with custom special servrces were
held at which the speaker was Dr.
J. 1i. George, President oi Chica-
go Theological Seminary.

At ten thirty Dr. George spoke
to a large audience ct students in
the chapel. his subject being
"Simple Goodness," claiming that
that commendablevirtue has been
lanicntably lost sight of. one or
the most strihing thoughts, as the
speakerdrew to a close, was that
a doctrinal union ot the many
churches ot the present day isim-
possible; but,as the radii of a
great circle in converging toward
the center, approach each other.
so the churches, in coming nearer
to Christ, came into closer touch
with each other.

At four o‘clock Dr, George
gave an inspiring talk before the
Voting Men's Christian Associa
tion in Institute IIall.

At ﬁve he led the regular Coir
lege Vesper service, taking his
text Irom the twe'ftli chapter of
Hebrews: “Therefore let us also,
seeing we are conrpassed about
with so great a cloud ct witnesses,
lay aside every weight, and the
sin which doth so easily beset
us, run with patience the race
that is set before us, looking un-
to icsus. the author and pertecter
of our faith.” Dr. George call»
ed special attention to iour points:

(i.) “Laying aside every
weight;” (2.) "and thesinwbich
doth so easily beset u. ” (3)
“run with patience;” (4.)"look-

ing unto Jesus."

THEY DIDN’T HURT us.

All or the orinueii Players eamc Through
without Inrury.

Gr-innell‘s light team came up
against another moiintaui of beef
in the game with Anrcs Saturday,
our team was even lighterihan
usual owing to the absence of
Carson and Barber. In spite or
the fact that Ames’ plays were
in shape oi line smashes for the
most part, yet owing to their ﬁne
physical condition, our men came
through in ﬁne shape with not a
man disabled. The practice work
has been stiff so far this week
andnoletupispromisedbeforethe
game at Des Moines next Sature
day. The team was lined up for
thirty minutes hard scrimmage
work last night and played some
fastball. There is considerable
doubt as to whether either Car-
son or Barber will be in the line
up against Drake. Aside from
the possible absence of these two
men. Grinnell will beln shape
to play the best ball of which she
is capable and those who take
advantage of the exceedingly
low rateto Des Moines next Sat-
urday are sureot seeing a hard
tought game, notwithstanding
the {act that the Scarlet and
Black will again meet a team
which is far her superior 'in
weight.

Much stress has been put upon
the value or support tror-n the side
lines in the past iew games and it
IS even more necessary and hence
more valuable when our team is
away irom the home grounds.
This sllould be borne in mind by
those who are in doubt about a:-
tending this game.

THE NEW BUILDING AT AMES.

the building is without adorn-
