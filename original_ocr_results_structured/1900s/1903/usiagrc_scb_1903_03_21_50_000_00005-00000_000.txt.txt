in their college press, one is stiuclt by a
strange s nilarity oi tone. Almost without
exceptioni seems to he a custom tor the
athletic manager iii tlte western college to
begin lns season's report by apnlo_ iiig ior
the ﬁnancial status ot the team and by
showing why lot this unexplainable reason
and tlial unavoidable cause the season has
ended with a ﬁnancial loss. And so while
they have ito deﬁcit to explain aivay the
manageis oi the was teatn will oﬁ'er iio
apology ii cointoriiiabiy to manage .i
custont they state a iew reasons wlty
the season iust passed tailed to art a larger
proﬁt.

From the business standpoint tlte season
had a most remarkable combination
or cit-cuiiistances tending to limit its
entire success. Fit-st and toremost the
management itselt ivas eiitircly lacking
in husinessexpetieiice. Secoiidly,the learn
had to contend witii one or the most in-
clement seasons iri the history oi lowa

the two days downpour piecediitg thcﬁrst

season oi was involved probably theiargest
necessary ruiiiitng expenses ot any hitherto
attempted.

The accompanying ﬁgures will give a

BASKETBALL

The basketball season iust closed has
been the most successiul yet played by a
crinneil team. in the ﬁrst place the
majority oi the games have been won;
secondly. the ﬁnancial support has been
sufﬁcient to pull the team out ahead in
the season, and last but not least the
past season has seen iowa College ac.
cept basketball as a permanent branch
at athletics in that the students have
taken an interest in the game.

The team started out with very good
prospects and early in the season won a
close game irom the Des lttoines v. M.
C. A. by a score oi to a A Des hiolaes
newspaper characterizes the game by
the phrase, “G nell showed great cili-
ciency in breaking up the team work oi
the y. M. c. A, team."

The class games brought out some
very good material and when regular
practice was started a very strong scrub
team was in the ﬁeld, which gave the
'Varsitystitt practice every night. The
good results ot this were seen in the Fella
game. which was won by a score, 256.

A nortbcrn trip was next taken which
brought our team against three ot the
strongest teams in the country, Al-
though none oi the games were won, the
trip was very proﬁtable in several re.
spects. it gave the team experience
and an example oi what coaching and

 

team work willdo. The team wasnow
in the pink oi condition and won the rivo
games with the strong lowa team by a
close scorcin each case. The ﬁrst game
on the home grounds was won o; in one
oi the closest games ever seen in Grille
neli. The next game at lowa City was
won by Grinnell. l§-|3.

lathe Independence trip an cxpcrir
ment was tried, in that the independence
team is practically a town team, and
Grinnell is not in the habit at playing
town reams. Grinnell won by a score oi
25 to win a rough and tumble game.
Cue college was played on the same
trip. The team was not in very good
shape on account otbeing up all night,
hutmanaged to win, tsetg. The true
comparison of the two teams was shown
the nest Saturday on the home grounds
when Grillnell won. gsro.

The team now had the best claim to
thechampionship oi any team in the
State. Aseries ot two games was are
ranged with the Des Moines y. at. c. A.
in the ﬁrst gamccrinneliwas swamp.
ed by a score, 2&6, in the second game
on the‘home grounds the team was de.
ieated by a score “2042 in one ot the
iasiest games oi the season. Had the
home team been able |o Connect with
the basket they would have won easily
as they outplayed the Y. M. it. Am
teamwork and shots at the basket.
Thedeteat may be laid to the tact that
thescrubs ceased to get out alter the
second trip and the 'Varsity had nogood
practice. The teams to begiven credit
tor playing a good, \Ip-hill game and
ﬁghting to the last. with the true Grin-
neilspirit.
