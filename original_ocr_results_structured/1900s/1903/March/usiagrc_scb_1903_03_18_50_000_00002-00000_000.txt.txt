THE INTERVSOCIETY DEBATEo

The second intel‘rsociety debate
otthc year. and the ﬁist to be held
llndCr the new systen1,will be given
in the Chapel Saturday evening,
March 21st. The question that
will be discussed isa timely one
in view of certain recent events.
It is, “Resolved that the use of
injunctionsinlabordisputesshould
be dispensed with" The Insti-
tute has chosen the negative side
or the question and the men who
will defend it are \Vebcr, ’04,
Brundage, ’04. and Benson '04.
The Clirestomathian speakers who
wrll uphold the afﬁrmative are
Leyenberger, '04, lrieeren, ’05, and
Collins, '04,

Under the new plan or inter
society debating. three contests a
year are to beheld instead ot one
in the tall term as ioi-nierly. The
taculty has promised to provrde a
suitable trophy to be contested
tor and the society which ii-liis
two debates in any one yeti is to
hold possession or it tor the en-
suing year. The Clirestoniatliian
society has already won the fall
debate this year but the Institute
shouirl win Saturday evening as
their rivals are burdened with the
coming debate with Des hIoilIcs
College, Ifsuch should be the re-
sult great interest will attach to
the spring debate as it will be the
decisive contest of the year and
the society winning then will hold
the trophy next year.

Considerable interest is being
talren in the coming contest trom
the tact that it will afford the
ﬁrst test or the new plan in actual
operation. Some have thought
that it was unwise to provide tor
holding an interrsoclety debate
each term for fear that their tre-
quency will cause a lessening ot
interest and ot rivalry. But
from present indications it would
seem that this fear is unfounded.
The Institute team has been hold»
ing trequent debates tor several
weeks with an opposition teain
chosen from their society, and the
Chresto debaters have been work—

”ing as taithiully as circumstances
would permit, so that the ﬁrst de~

bate promises to be a hard fought
contest well up to the standard of
previous inter-society debates.
