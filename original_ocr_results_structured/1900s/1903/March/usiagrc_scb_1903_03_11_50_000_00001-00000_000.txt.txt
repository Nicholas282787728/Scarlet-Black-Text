HAMILTON w MABIE.

Last Number on the christian Associne
7A Splendid Lecture,

rion Cour,

The last lecturc of the V, M.
C. A. lecture cottise was given
last evening by ltamllton W.
Mabie on "Literature as a l’ere
sonal Resource.” Mr. Mable came
to us with an exceptionally good
reputation, which he sustained
most admirably in his address be
tore the large audience which

greetedhim last night For an
hour and a halt he held not only

the attention, but deep inteiest of
all present, His deﬁnition and
discussion of "The Great Book"
was tull ot ncw thoughts and sug-
gestions in which one recognized
the spirit of the true critic, who
strives to aid his hearers in their
conception ofgieat and good liter-
ature. He traced the line of
great authors from the illustri-
ous Homer down to the famous
men of our own age, pointing
out the characteristic beauties of
each onc's works, their effects on
the literature of later generations
and above all the great ideals ot
lite in which the great master-
pieces abound,

His statement that a single man,
the author, does not make a great
book, but that it is the result of a
nation's growth and tile develop-
ment of the ﬁner senses is quickly
recognized as a historical [act or
great importance. As the best
example ot tltis in our otvn age,
Mr, Mabie spoke of the Scotch
people, with their love or nature
and wild romance, which ever “1'
sures to us a ﬂowing stream of
beautiful romances and flesh
poetry. The pure and happy lite
of a man, like Olive: Wendall
Holmes, who gave so mtlch in
his writings to bring real happiness
into our own lives, is certainly
most beautiful and well deserves
the high tribute which the speaker
paid it.

Certainly, Mr. Mable saitl much
to make its icilllYt: more than ever
bctore the value oi literature as a
personal resource in our own lives,
as it brings us into acquaintai-ice
with so many at the greatest and
truest men, who so freely give to
us all their noblest thoughts and

ideals.

BASE BALL.

A Veteran Team With Which to Begin'

the Season—Many sworn; candidates
Among the Now Men

Athletic prospects are bright
for the coming season. Thcti-ack
team has a (me bunch ot promis-
ing candidates hard at work and
the base ball team promises to be
one of the strongest that has cvcr
represented the Scarlet and Black.
Last year's team tvon the champ
ionship of the state college league,
composed of Ames, Iowa, Cornell
and Grinnell and is now in pos-
session of the silver bat, which
must be held three years in suce
ccssion by any college that is to
retain it permanently.

Oflast year‘s team, two otthe
strongest players were lost in Fisk
and Clark and their places will be
hard to ﬁll. Cole is the only other
member of the team who is not in
school. Altho there are a number
ot old men to try tor places, every
new man who does faithful
work has a chance to make the
’Varsity. It is a fair ﬁeld and no
favors, and the men who play the
best ball will get the positions on
the team.

For pitcher thch is a strong list
of candidates. including King, who
did his full share of the work in
the box last year. Fillmore, who
shall be mtich stronger this yeai
than ever before, and Swalluni,
who is probably a better man for
the posttion than either of the old
men, Marsh will probably retain
his old position behind the bat,
with Benson as a strong substitute
in case of accident. All of the
other positions are open to the
best men with a chalice for every-
body. King will probably hold
down the third bag when not in
the pitcher's box.

For thcoc positions a large num-
ber of strong candidates will make
warm competition.
play second base and Fillmore
will probably nitrite the team in
the ﬁeld, with Gilchrist anothcr
probable 'Vaisity man. la’ridgcns,
oi Iildora. is a new man who will
undoubtedly make the team this
year or next. and Shilling is the
strongest candidate for short stop.
At least thirty candidates will be

at work as soon as the weather

vent this a few things should be
done: (a) The public should be
enlightened as to the adequate
provision already made for any
man willing to work for it should
be encouraged to refer all appli-
cants to the proper places for in-
vestigation, care and treatment,
should stand ready to help in the
treatment with both money and
service, but at the same time,
should be persuaded not to give
money to any stranger on the
streets or at the door. (b) Insti~
tutions such as 1 have visited and

their supporters to provide some
kind of work test. to cease selling
tickets to be given away and to
make the bath compulsory, (c)
Cheap lodging houses should be

that the regents of the University
