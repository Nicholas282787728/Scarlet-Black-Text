IOWA COLLEGE GR'NNELL IOWA SATURDAY, MAR H 7, l903.

 

THE BROADER GRINNELL SPIRIT

A Different Phase of the celebrated Char»
acteristic ei town College students.

The faculty andsttrderrtsoflowa
College are going to attend the
big intercollegiate debate next
Friday, united in spirit, and with
the common thought: We mm!
lit/‘17 zit/ml CW‘UMZ.

The men who have been select»
ed to represent the college in de-

bate with the best debaters oI
Cornell College have been Cons
stalit and untiring in their cfforts
to ﬁnd every possible fact and
ﬁgure which will aid them on
their side of the question. As the
time approaches when they shall,
in a few short minutes, give to
their hearers the results of months
of unrenlitted toil, they feel the
need of every good inﬂuence
which we can bring to bear in
their favor. More than anything
else, it was the poor support
which we students gave our men
in the debate with Washburn Col-
lege last year that caused them
to be defeated. This year it is to
be the loyal support ofevcry one.
both of the factilty and student-
body, which will help them to
win.

The interest and enthusiasm
which are everywhere being marl»
ifested are propitious for the comr
ing event. “Grinnell Spirit” in
Debating and Oratory bids fair
soon to equal that in Athletics.
This is as it should be, This is
the condition which the Faculty
of Iowa College have long wished
to bring about. Well trained
muscle alone is a splendid thing
to have. but brains and muscles,
both well trained, make a combi-
nation that is simply irresistible.

Inanticipation ot the crowd
which will attend the debate. the
Colonial theatre has been special-
ly secured. The unavoidable
price of admission has been cut
intwo so that there will be ab-
solutely no excuse for anybody's
feeling lonesome. Special ad.
Vance tickets are now being sold
and after Wednesday noon they
may be exchanged for the regu-
lar tickets. Regular tickets may
be purchased on Thursday and
Friday preceding the debate.
Special reservations will be made

for Cornell's big contingent and

for the S arlet and Black slur
dents, The colors or the tub
Colleges will be Conspicuous,
Music bolh before and after the
debate will add to its

merit.
Judges ofthedcbatewill be Hon.

Edward Aylsworth Ross. Prof. G.
E. Finch and Judge Horace E.
Deemer. Governor Curnmins has
been invited to preside over this
meeting of Iowa's two leading
colleges. but owing to his absence
troni Des Moines his acceptance
has not yet been received.

Y. M, C. A. COURSE LECTURE.

Don’t forget the lecture next
Tuesday evening by the brilliant
author of “My Study Fire” and
other books and essays. It is the
last number of the course and
probably the strongest number.
Mr. Mabie stands in the foremost
ranks of the literary world of to
day and is a man whom it will
not do to miss hearing. He com-
bines qualities that are rare in
literary men, those of great liter»
ary talent and especial oratorical
ability. He is a man who can
not only write, but who can talk
almost as well as he can write.
Seats on sale at R. R. Rust& Co's.
Price so cents.

MISS WILLARD'S PIANOFORTE
RECITAL.

The second numberin theSchool'

of Music series was given in the
chapel last night by Carolyn Wile
lard, pianist. In spite of the in.
clement weather the audience was
fully as large as that which heard
the ﬁrst recital; a fact which is due
to the plan of selling only course
tickets.

The best indication of Miss Wil~
lard's ability lay in the fact that
she was able to retain the interest
of her hearers throughout a long
and very severe program. Either
of the two ﬁrst numbers, the Bach
concerto or the Schumann, would
have furnished sufﬁcient backbone
for a substantial program; the
placing otthem both together was
a hard test of otrr appreciative
ability. The contrast between
these two numbers is very great;
the one purely classical, polished
and graceful in every phase, mel-
odious and tender, but altogether
unimpassioncd, and always pretty.

 

The fantasie, on the other hand,

 

is as perplexing a composition as
Miss Willard could have chosen,
and the ﬁrst hearing leaves one in
a state of doubt as to its precise
meaning. As the Bach number
portrays formal music in its pen
fcctlon, the Schumann number
goes to the extreme of Romanti~
cisni. it is passionate, headlong
and full ofabrupt contrasts, only
now and then giving the headlong
llttleclue to its intention. I! is
no discredit to ﬁnd this work at
ﬁrst hearing unintelligible, for
Schumann was given to express-
ing himselt in just such vague
forms; perhaps after the sixth or
six hundredth hearing some struc-
tural idea might be revealedI and
the dark, muddy, background con»
vey a sinister meaning.

Ofthe remaining numbers on
the program, the Rubinstein etude
and the ballade by Chopin were
the most interesting. The Rubinr
stein was played with thorough
mastery of both its technical and
musical content; the same is true
ofthe Ballade. The ﬁrst really
tuneful music on the program was
in the Chopin number, and even
this is less tuneful than nine tenths
of Chopin’s worlr, The opening
melody of the ballade is a tender,
mournful strain, evidently a folk-
song ofPolish origin. Thestorrny
interlude between the stanzas of
the foilesong is one.of the most
passionate outbursts in all the
Chopin ballades, and we can read
in it the patriotic indignation of
the composer over the wrong to
which his fatherland had been
subjected.

Miss Willard’s playing, on the
whole, impressed one as being in»
tellectual rather than emotional.
Her phrasing and feeling for tone
values are ﬁne, her pieces are care»
fully wrought out. and nothing
seem to be left to the inspiration
of the moment. She seems to
have a fondness for the involrcd
and problematic in music; and
from her program it is evident
that she has little regard for mere
tuneiuluess. Her strong point is
intellectual grasp and clear structr
ural conception; and she shows to
least advantage in the simple and
prrrely poetic music or the type
shown by MacDowell’sWaterLily,
which she gave in response to an
encore.

The graduates and friends of
Iowa College held a very enthu»
siastic reception for Pres. Bradley,
following a dinner, at the Hotel
Bellevue, Boston, on Monday
evening, March 2,1903. Besides
a number of Visitors which includ—
ed many Congregational preacl‘h
ers and journalists, of Boston,
there was present a large number
of alumniia list of whom I en-
close. There was much love and
hope for Iowa College expressed
and much Grinnell spirit in evid-A
ence. The success of the occa-
sion was due largely to Dr. Hill
who had charge of all the prelimr
inary arrangements.

A New England Association of
