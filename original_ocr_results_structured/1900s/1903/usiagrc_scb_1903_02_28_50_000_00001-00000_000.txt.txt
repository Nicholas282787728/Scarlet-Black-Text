ERNEST GAMBLE CONCERT.

The Second Concert on the christian A545,
sociation Lecture Course Given to a
well Pleased Audience.

One otthelaigest audiences oi-
tlre’year came to the opera house
lastThurs ay evening to hear the
Elitestbnniblc Concert Co. hitss
Dow. the Vlulillltil, was unable to
appear and her place was taken
by the Iowa College quartet.

Interest in the concert centered
largely in Mr. Gamble, who has
achieved considerable reputation
as a concert singer, Mr. Gamble
rs the possessor ot a rarely ﬁile
bass voice, rich, smooth and of
good compass. Like most conr
cert singers there are somethings
on which Mr.Gainble may be ad-
versely criticised, but tor a popu-
lar concert, the lecture course
committee would have found difﬁ—
culty in Finding a singer who
would give better satisfaction.

otThursday evening, but were well
pleased by all of Mr. Gamble's
numbers. .

Mr. Morley, the pianist, aeconr
plished the task oi playing Mr.
Gaiiible’s accompaniments most
satisfactorily, but his solo play»
mg was eliective in grace, charac-
ter or expression.

It was to be regretted that Miss
Dow was llnablctotukehci part
but her place was veny accept
ably ﬁlled by the quartet whose
numbers iieie received almost as
enthusiastically as those or Mi.
Gamble. Among the songs oi
the quartet, nits art original setr
ting. by Mr. Ohls, of "The Night
Has a Thousand Eyes." This
quartetis ati oiganization to be
proud oi, tor the quality of its
iiorlt is excellent and it sings

listed for the event and followed‘
each other in quick

succession
a series of well prepared
tricks, ranging in difﬁculty from
the kip lo a giant string. Next.
seven men lined up tor work on
the parellel bars. Greatirnprove-
ment over the work oi last year
was noticeable in this event, and
several new men did very eonlr
mendabe work.

The exhibition- of the horse
which followed was exceptionally
good, and was, perhaps the most
interesting part of the apparatus
work.

Next came an exihition of club
swinging by Burnside, which was
characterized by a grace and tree
doin of movement which always
pleases as was inanitested by the
rounds of applause which follow
ed.

The men then crime out for the
rings and did some good tt'olk,
hardly attaining, hotievcr, to the
high standard of the preceding
performances. ‘

During the few ntiniil which
elapsed bctireen the ambition
proper and the circus, Mr. lvlitr
chell gave an exhibition of torch
srringing. This rtas a very pleas-
ing ieattrre and allorded sortie-
thing in the way of variety to the
program,

The lights were turned on once
