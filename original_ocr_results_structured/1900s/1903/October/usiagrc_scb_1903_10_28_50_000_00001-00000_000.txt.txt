MISS GRTSWOLD’S PIANOFORTE
RECITAL.

Our New instructor Proves Heiseir an
Accomplished Plano Artist.

on Monday evening, October
26., Miss Minute lI. Griswold
made her debut as a pianist bee
toreaGrinnell audience. The re-
cital was a pronounced artistic
success. The program
romantic one. and replete with
brilliant technical work, in which
Miss Griswold showed much ease
and lluency or expression. Her
handling ot delicate passages. as
in the Piernt‘: Serenade and the
Chopin Spianato, was a delight
to the listener. and the heavy
chord work of Rachmaninoff Pre-
lude and the Polonaise in E ﬂat
was handled with equal ease and
effect.

The Rachmaninoff Prelude in C
sharp minor is new to a Grrnnell
audience, though it has created
constder‘able furor In musical
circles. and appears on many
concert programs. It is of the
modern Russian school, a “basso
ostinuto." worked otrt tvith con-
summate Miss Griswold’s
handling of the bass melody and
her brilliant playing of interposed
technical passages, her grasp or
interlocking chord passages and
her artistic conception of the
Prelude as a whole. all
remarkable. and thoroughly ap
precialed.

The Pieriié serenade in Ab. a
fragile thing. was delicately han
dled and warmly applauded.
Sinding's Marche Grotesque is a
deliglttiully humorous Composir
lion and Miss Griswold played
it with excellent appreciation of
its possibilities. The Fruhlingsr
rauschen escaped her. however.
The tempo was too rapid. and
though it was a brilliant tech
nical study, the breath
ot Spring was not upon it.
The two Schubert paraphrases
were remarkably well done. Scliu
bcrt is heard far too little on
modern piano programs. Miss
Griswold may feel sure or our
gratitude in giving us thistasteot
the work of the most exquisite
song writer of the Fatherland.

The Chopin compositions all re-

ling and were played with insight
and artistic feeling. ”interpreta-

wold assuredly takes high rank.

All in all the recital was both
proﬁtable and enjayable—a dis

THAT IOWA GAME

Grinnell Loses to a Heavier, Stronger and Bet-
ter Team--Score Exaggerates
Iowa’s Superiority

For a good many years back in-
to the misty past Grinnell his
cherished a mud trope or some
day wrestlinganother victory from
the. clutches ot the State Univer
sity. But it was decreed by the
tates that that happy event is to
be once more indeﬁnitely post-
poned. when, being surpassed in
two of the prime requisites ot a
good football team. the Scarlet
and Black yielded the palm of
victory to the warriors of the old
gold at the close of one of the
hardest fought games Ward Field
has ever seen. Amidst the cheers
of the victors. the deﬁant yells of
the vanquished and the mournful
signing of the loyal cottonwoods,
Iowa marched off the ﬁeld last
Saturday the winner by a score of
I770, She owes her triumph to
her superior weight, to Jones and
to Grifﬁth. As a ground gaining
halt back the former named player
lived up to hrs reputation. As an
able ﬁeld general and a runner
back of punts, Grifﬁth is an un~
qualiﬁed success. Grinnoll owes
her deieat to her diminulive

Iowa college people but whcnhe
was compared with the Iowa
linemen he was a mere boy in size.
Our [umbles otpunts were many
and costly.

Not a man on the Gritrnell team
failed to play the game well.
Though it can truthfully be said
that the play often did not do the
players and Coach Erickson
justice. yet at times the Grinnell
defense proved as strong as the
strongest a Scarlet and Black line
has ever presented and Grinnell
charges never
resistible.

The ﬁrst halt was decidedly in
favor of Iowa. but in the second
the Hawkcyes were tairly out-
played. Time and. again would
Benson or Van Liew stop the ball

ON TO CORNELL.

A Rate or One and One-third Fare has
Been Secured ror the Trip to
Mt. Vernon.

Another Sllllrdiy brings an—
other contest for Grinnell upon
the gridiron. We compete ontlie
3ist with a team which is some<
where near our equal as regards
weight and available material.
Cornell, tints tar, has played
rather inconsistent Iootball if one
canjudgebycomparisonotscores.
Coc College met deteat at their
hands by the score of only Io—o,
yet Cornell played what looks,
from the score. to have been an
excellent early season game with
Iowa, holding the Hawkeyes
down to one touchdown and a
goal kick. We wonder at the last
mentioned score when we think of
the poor showing made later
against Highland Park. Never—
theless comparison oi scores is
but a poor means ot judging any
team and Cornell will no doubt:
play the game or the season
againstus. Arateotoneandone-
third (are has been secured. This
offers the student body a chance
to see a good game ot tootball,
and a good school where it will
receive the most courteous treat-

ment.

THE HUMBOLDT SOCIETY,

On last Saturday evening, de-
spite the excite'ment otthe after-
noon. the members of the Hume
boldt Society and friends to the
number of ﬁfty gathered in the
lecture hall of the Chemical
Labratory to listen to the address
of Prof. L, W, Andrews of Iowa
City. The recent improvements
in this hall have rendered it one
or the most pleasant rooms ot the
college ior meetings at this sort.
The paper read by Prot. Andrews
on "Science in its Relation to
Ethical Sentiments" wrs in sub-
ject very scholarly and in term
very interesting. The address of
thirty minutes was ﬁlled with
many valuable deductions and im-
portant conclusions along the
line of thought.

The extreme popularity of this
course ot lecture is evinced by the
number who have recently joined
the club and by the number ot
visitors who attend each meeting.
or Wednesday, November tr,
l’rot. Hendrixson will entertain
the club with his lecture on
“Viodern Application of Electri-
city to Mnnulactureing Industry,”

This will afford those interested
in the subject of Electricity some
very valuable hints by one or

 

authority.
