THE UNCLE SAM CLUB.

The Uncle Sam Club has just
closed another very successful
year's work, While the success
ot such a work is not to be iudg-
ed by numbers or by anything
that could be put tnto ordinary
statistics, the growth of_this club
has been signiﬁcant. Starting
three years ago with a halt dozen
members, it grew in the ﬁrst two
years to about 60 members and
in this the third year of the club's
work about 85 boys have been on
roll, The new Club House has
now been occupied for several
months and has proven the ad-
vantages ot good quarters in such
work

Two separate clubs have been
run thisyear, one ior boys under
eleven years at age, and the regu-
lar club for those over eleven.
Next year it will be necessary to
run at least three clubs, forming a
new on: for boys over fourteen,
The club will be handicapped
next year by the loss of Mr. Don-
lson, who has been the prime
mover in the club since its organ
ization, but thevery crhciency ot
his past work is the best guaran-
tee oi the permanent success oi
the club.
