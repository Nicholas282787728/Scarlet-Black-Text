Football Situation Encouragingiwho

are the Promising candidatess
The East High Game

The wtrni weather of the past
few days has not been the kind to
put the football cttididates iii the
hardy coniitiin needed for the
game. Although the East Des
t\‘loines game Monday wasa short
one, it was plainly evident that
some of the men are “soft"—too
much so when it is taken into
consideration that the Coe team.
which Grinnell plays Saturday at
Cedar Rapids, has been in train»
ingfor almost three weeks. There
were streaks in the High school
game which showed possibilities
of a good team later. but the play
in general was ragged. Last
night’s practice was the hardest
this season. and though Robinson
made two long runs for touch-
downs against the scrubs, yet the
latter made stubborn resistance,
Saturday when the East Des
Moines team did not arrive owing
to delayed trains. the scrubs and
the Varsity had a few minutes try
out. One of the bright features of
the situation is the fact that the
scrubs are strong. This is in itself
an assurance of a hard playing.
team all through the season.

The unexpected departure of
one man who played on last
year’s Varsity, Milo Smith. leaves
a vacancy at end. lint no place
is assured to anyone. with the
possible exception of Van Liew's.

Theindividuals most prominent
in these candidacies fol-the several
places are, Sliipmaii, Tool, and
Muyskens,center;Handel,Doran.
Evans, Furls, Clock, tor guards;
Dack, Auracher, Valleau, Glenn
Clark and West at tackles; Carl-

son, Barber. Webb and Walleser
at ends; van : Liew will play
quarterback. while for the halt-
back positions, in Robinson, Fuls
Ier and Mullen we ought to get
two good sets of backs, strength
ened by the men trying at present
for fullmo'Grady and Gllley.

Mr, H. D, Rawson. of Hallet 81

yesterday and presented revised

With a special View to our needs

different buildings, besides the
collection of library planswith Dr.
DeweyinAlbany. Thecommittee
has wasted no time and it has col-
lected much information which
will count in the new building.

so carefully have the plans been
made, that, attention having been
called to them at Beloit, where a
college library is to be bllilt, Pro-
tessor Chapin of that college came
in yesterday to confer with Mr.
Douglass. It is planned to perfect
plans now and to let the contract
in January, so that work can begin
as early as possible in March.

The new library is to stand just
north of Goodnow Hall. The
chapel will be placed north of the
new library.

THE xEu' CHAPEL.

Work upon the new chapel will
be deferred until spring. not only
because the iund is incomplete,
but on account of the unexpected
cost of the building as planned,
and the hope that prices and labor
will be lower next season. Many
churches have promised to con.
tribute to the fund this fall and it
is hoped to complete it during the
winter.

THE ENLARGED COTTAGE.

Almost 59,000 is being put into
tlieenlarged cottageiorgirls. The
work was begun about the middle
otiuly, Mr. H. L. Triplett having
charge of the construction. There
will be twelve new rooms; the old
rooms are being reiurnislied and
reﬁtted. Many modern improve
ments have been introduced: sta~
Iionary lavatories, call bells and
single cot beds will be placed in
each room. The old dining room
is to be used as a parlor, and
kitchen and laundry arrangements
are very complete. The new
dining room will seat eighty peo-
ple. The whole building will be
connected with the central steam
plant.

FALL TRACK WORK BEGINS.

Large Number of Candidates Arc out7
More Men Are Wantcd.

The pleasant weather
past iicek has brought several
men out to train for the Fall
Handicap meet, which \\'ll| be held
the fore partot next month. With
the exception ottlie stars in last
years senior class, most of the old
men are back in school. All these
have had some of the green taken
off them by a season's experience
and can be relied upon for a good
showing next spring. In addition
to the old men there is some very
promising material in sight among
the new comers.

The fall handicap meet holds
an important place in Iowa Col-
lege track athletics. It serves as
a test for new men, by means
of which they can get a line on
themselves and also show what
they can do. Capt. Templeton
has seen many of the new men
but no doubt there are many
more. Every new man who is
not trying for the football squad
should train for track, the exer~
cise alone is needed by every
man. No one knows what he can
do until he tries, and this is espec
ially true as ragards track work.

THE GENERAL RECEPTION.

With dtie regard to the behest
of the President that the general
reception should commence at
an earlier hour than formerly, the
company gathered in Rand Gym-
nasium on Friday evening to open
ly congratulate the new protegecs
of Iowa College.

With the usual care and tasty
ideas the socialcommittee or 'the
Christian Associations had draped
the scarlet and black, and placed
the palms and banners so that
trom the galleries above as one
looked down upon the throng, a
more harmonious or brilliantscene
could not be desired. Accord
ing to custom cards were given
out and the introductions
and signing of names consumed
an hour, which would have other-
wise been very uncomfortable and
embarrassing. Numerous punch
bowls around the room were tend-
ed by the young ladies of the
High School. During the course
ofthe evening in a few informal
addresses from Pres. Bradley.
l’rof. Burnet. Prof. Steiner and
Prof. Main the new students were
again welcomed. some of the
old students ofthc classes of IgoI

The emphatic and liberal way
in which the Alumni have been
responding with items of news for

Alumni interest in Alumni news.
It shows also a general approval
of any efforts of SCARLET AND
BLACK toward the bettering of

the Alumni department, In fact

it has warranted an enlargement
of space given to alumni news to
such an extent that the manager
of that hitherto single front es~
tablishmcnt has decided to move
his stock and ﬁxtures around the

with this issue his sign hangs out
on page four. The entire two
columns will be devotetl to that
department as long as enough ins
teresting and reliable facts can be
found to ﬁll it.

Here is acliance for co-opern-
tion in a business that will be
proﬁtable to every one. Fill out

ORGAN RECITAL BY GEO. w
ANDREWS.

George W, Andrews, of
Oberlin College. gave an organ
recital in the college chapel Sat-
urday evening at halt past '
The recital was originally' an»
notinced to be given at fouro‘clcck
but on account of delays in trains
from the west it had to be post»
poncd to the later hour. which
was very unfavorable, permitting
only a very small number to hear
him out of many who were look
ing torward to the occasion.

Mr. Andrews plays with vigor
and great rhythmic power, and
in his recital brought forward
many new examples of organ
music, showing some ofthe later
tendencies ot organ composition.
The tonal effects obtained by Mr.
Andrews were very eitective, and
many of them novel. Mr. An»

drews also played at vespers Sun»
