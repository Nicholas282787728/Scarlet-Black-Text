SCARLET AND BLACK BANQUET.

The annual banquet given by
the management to the staff of
the SCARLET AND BLACK was held
this year as usual at the Chapin
House on the evening of Satur-
day. April 4th. Out of town vis-
itors. who enjoyed the evening
togctlter with the local netvspapei
men were Mr. lohnson Brigham,
slate librarian and former editor
of thc Jill'letl/ta’ Mont/ll] and also
Hon. Samuel Strauss, editor of
Riga-rim and Lair/N. At 8:45
o‘clock the guests were tislteied
into the dining rooni. where cove
ers had been laid lortwetlty-tlil’ee.
An elegant tour course dinner
was served. earnations being used
as lavnrs and at the conclusion of
the repast Toastmaster Bair cal|~
ed upon Mr. Biighani to address
the cornpany.\\-ho respondeil with
“The Country Newspaper, Its
Prospects and Limitations." Isle
declared that the young man who
starts out in journalism with his
personal ideals and because oi
inﬂuences of certain individuals in
the community. is obliged to
publish a paper, which caters to
their private beneﬁt—that the ex-
ample ot this young man is not
typical oi the large class of coun»
try journalists. as has oiten been
declared. No journalism can be
as unsuccessful as that which per.
sists in publishing lies scandals
and theories on suspicion which
sevei communities, disgraccs tam-

_ ilies and nourish the germs ot

public sensationalist-n. Editorial
Opinion should be subordinate to
the idea of crystalltzing right
public opinion.

MLStrnuss‘s address was on.
“Intense Dangers injourilalism.”
llis views were somewhat at vare
innce with those of Mr. liiigllam
along pdrtictilar lines. For a
paper to have influence it
have a circulation. Ail editor can
not be individualistic, apart from
the community but must synie

pathtcally delll the sctisar

in list

iiith

 

tions and local prejudices, which
constitute the public mind. His
idea may be of the very highest;
he may believe that the summit
of his success is not reached until
he has obtained one hundred per
cent of all he desires. But
Roosevelt has often said. he is
happy ii he can get one per cent
of what he wants.

Fl‘CS. Biadiey spoke on, “The
Relations of Faculty the
College Paper.” Tllccoeoperntivc
spirit of the community is clue in
part to its inﬂuence. and what
ptospet-ity may come to us is
brought about partially by the
excellent management and well
directed el‘lurls of the SCARLET
AND BLACK.

It is cliFﬁcult to ﬁnd

to make of the ‘JcaitLET AND
