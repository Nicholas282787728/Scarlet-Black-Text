NCE on a time there was a
college where manyyoung
people were gathered together.
Long had the college prospered
and always the students were
loyal. returning withal a tuition of
ﬁtty dollars per annum. And
ever ambitious torall that is good
tor the students. the Rabbis wlio
iostered the college thus had he
thought them: We should have
forthe men a gymnasium, like the
one that otir women are using.
that also the men may render
unto themselves greater physical
proﬁt. And they did as they
pondered. .

And anon when the students
assembled in autumn alter the
Summer vacation in which It was
builded. the Rabbis spake to them
saying: Behold we hate now a
gymnasium tor men as well as
one {or the women. Much \\'lll
it cost to keep in repair the par
titions. the lockers and bath tubs.
Your tuition is now only ﬁlty.
We must raise it. a little to pay for
repairingt‘hebuildingond keeping
the ﬁxturesin order. Fifty ﬁve
dollars is all we shall ask you.

Pleased with the structure and
prospects, the students gladly
assented. renderingyearlya rental
or titty ﬁve dollars.

Now as it happened there was
in this college a full generation of
students, and the scholar who
stayed there the longest was gone
by the end of four summers; so
when the ﬁlth came around no
one in college knew that
tuition had ever been lower. This
was the summer when nothing
was spent in repairing the build-
ing and keeping it cleanly. l’lasi
Ker fell off from its ceilings and
the lockers were easy to open.
Mud came in on the ﬂoor and
departed not with the bringcr. but
stuck here and there on the
asphalt. Porcelain tubs were
neglected so that they rusted.

 

Cold was the water that ran
through the pipes to the shouers.
Cranniesand nooks were lett ﬁlthy
with refuse. The smell of the
basement was bad to the nostrils.

And on lived the students com~
plaining one to another. In came
the visitors often. to comment on
the condition. All of the Rabbis

seemedto forget that the building
needed attention. e'en while storr

, ing away in their critters the shek

els levied to clean it

They are living there yet. the
students rightly complaining. the
building slowly decaying and the
Rabbis continue to slumber.
