on Friday the
baseball team will play Drake at

Iowa College

Des Moines, this being the second
college game played this season
by Grinnell. Although Drake is
not in the lioseball League. yet
she is o Ie of the strongest college
teams in the state which Grinncll
meet this season. Drake
has played more games so far this
season than Gl'inttell, and has
crossed hats With some strong
teams. Iowa’s fast team has plays
ed hcr twice and won both
games. though it was far from it
Walkaway. Cornell also defeated
her 6 tn4,thle wetteleated Cornell
the next day in a close game. the
score being 4 (03

Although they have met with a
number of dclcats,Manager Utter-

turning point and |hat from now

not appear so strong, will no doubt
