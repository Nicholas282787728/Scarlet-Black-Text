WE ARE glad to notice the in—
terest which is being taken in the
athletic line this fall. It certainr
ly shows a ﬁne spirit of co-operzi-
tion and this is something which
is very necessary, itwe wish the
position which we have held here-
tulore. The class ot rooo took
with it almost the entire football
team as well as a majority of the
baseball team, so that the outlook
forthis year was not overly bright.
But the men seem to realize the
Situation and have turned out in
amazing numbers. Thursday night
we noticed thirty'ﬁve men out in
football clothes. Rarely, if ever,
has Grinnell been able to muster
out three full teams. Moreover,
that same night. there were men
tyrsih candidates out on the track
This, too, is an amazingly large
number tor the fall when there are
no contests, as in the Spring. But
[lie‘ men seem to realize that in
order to turn out a good team next
year they must work faithfully
and thcy have certainly shown, by
turning out in such numbers, that
they will make the best of it. Be
sides the football squad and track
lnen,scveral baseball men have
been getting out every evening.
As yet we can say nothing about
the prospects, tor the material is
for the greater part, new, and a
little practice will bring about
wondertul results, Judging from
the number of men who take part
in athletics this fall it certainly
augurs well for Giillnell. It was
practice which made tormcr gen-
erations of students accomplish
what they did for Iowa College,
and with all the facilities we have
this year let us put our shoulder
to the wheel and maintain our po-
sition of former years, which is
one of which we may well feel
proud.

THE GLEE Club is one of our
most nourishing organizations.
and one of the tnost popular. It
has had six years of successful
history, maintaining a high stand»
ard of excellence and winning an
enviable reputation throughout
the state. This record isthe more
remarkable when the fact is re-
membered that the personnel of
the club is undergoing a constant
change. Each year sees old men
depart, and new rnen enter. th
under tlle guidance ot Prct. Cole.
the excellence of the club is pre
served. No better proot of his
untiring labors could be found.
An unusual number of vacancies
occur in the club this year, all of
which must be ﬁlled with new
material. Vacancies occur in
each of the four parts,‘ ottering
opportunities to all of musical
ability. Any number ot Candis

talce the examination. Ability
alone makes one elegible to the
club. and each stands upon his
own merits. A laige number of
applicants should respond to the
notices of examinations

It is ﬁtting that a few words be
said in the SCARLET AND BLACK,
concerning the mission study
classesfor the coming year. This
has always been an important do
partment in the work of the As
sociations, lowa College now has
seven at her graduates in the
foreign held,

For the fall term the text select
ed to. study IS John R. Mott’s
“Watcllword of the Movement.”
This is an intensely interesting
and instructive boot: and any Stu»

one of the mission study classes
which will be organized the Com»
ing Week. ‘
