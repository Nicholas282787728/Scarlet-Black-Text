Qﬁhitotiul

As EVERYONE connected with
the/college takes a breathingspell
from tarday until Monday. the
SCARLET AND BLACK force con-
clude to do the same—they think
they need a rest about as much as
anybody. Consequentlythere will
be no issue of this paper Saturday.

THE FACT that the fate of the
Honor System hangs in the bal~
ance aiidthat the result of the vote
will determine whether it is to be
reradopted or abolished should
command the serious attention of
every student. It is no light mat-
ter to changeasystem which so vi-
tally affects the moral atmosphere
surrounding the student body
and which is such a potent tactor
in the problem ot student govern
ment. Every student should give
the question the most thoughtful
consideration, and then cast his
vote for what he honestly and
conscientiously believes to be the
best tor Iowa College.

STUDENTS or Iowa College have
abundant reason for thanksgiving.
We have the best that is going,
and why shouldn’t we be thankr
ful? OE couise we have to make
one exception to this Statemenli
but so do Chicago and Michigan.
It does seem that Iowa is a little
ahead of us in football matters.
But even in this we should be
thankful that we have a legitimate

We Q NEWW

 

' claim to the iiex terbest place in

this statcia position equal to the
best before Iowa's sudden rise to
championship honors. We hope
to see our claim made good to

morrow.

AS WE see it, the Board of Con
trol at the State University has
done right in rejecting Wisconsm‘s
challenge tor a game to be played
at Chicago December s. If a
game with Wisconsin would def-
initely settle the championship
problem, Iowa would possibly be
justiﬁed in arranging for a game.
But this much mooted question
could nctbe settledivith one game.
Minnesota has some good claims,
and possibly Nebraska would have
to be considered. Under the cirr
cumstanees the o‘ecsiou of the
Board of Control is a \v' e one.

Y. W.C.A. Fudge Partyr

Y.W.C.A. entertained her mem-
bers last Saturday afternoon in an
inlornial way by giving a “fudge
party." At four o’clock the girls
began to assemble in Institute
Hall bringing work bagsaudchat
irig dishes,

Misses Cadwell and Porterﬁeld
sang several very pleasing numr
hers and Miss Courtney in her
charming way entertained those
present by readings.

This social gathering had a
large attendance and seemingly
was greatly enjoyed by everyone.
It gave a good opportunity for
old and new girls to become better
acquainted and it is hoped that
thus it may aid in carrying on the

Association work this yeai.

Generally, at about this time of
the year, the Yale football team
consists of eleven chronic invalids
who have never seen a football
who come to the ﬁeld on crutches
and go away on stretchersint
least, according to reports from
New Haven. At about the some
time the Harvard teami resting
on its lauicls, and admiring itself
inthemannerofNarcissus. When
this is the case Harvard generally
does not win.— Ial'vard Adi/050”,
