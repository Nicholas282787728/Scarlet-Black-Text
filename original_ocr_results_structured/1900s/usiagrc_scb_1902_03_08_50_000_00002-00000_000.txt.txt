MEMBER of the athletic
board at the State Univere

srty has stated that Manager Me-
Cutchen has spent. during his
three years as general manager.
over 51500 more than his salary
in order to maintain his position
creditably. and the best inter-

is only one thousand dollars a
year. Mr, McCutchen has not
yet resigned. however.

HE visit from President
elect Bradley. though but
a briet one. has undoubtedly been
productive at much good. Dr.
Bradley has met with the greatest
cordiality from both faculty and
students. and is evidently in
hearty sympathy wrth our college
lite. Grinnell people are cons
ﬁrmed in thelrbelief that the inter-
ests of the college are In safe
hands, and that it is entering up
on a period ot prosperous growth,

mm; principle, which might
be called "equality oi op-
purtunity”has come tolbc so clear-

ments. that any deviation from it
meets not only with protest, but
with the strongest condemnation.
By the slow process of evolution
the lecture course committees
have hit upon a plan tor the selle
ing of seats. which. though possi-
bly not approved by all. gives to
all the same opportunity. and
prevents any scheming by whlch
one portion of the community is
tavored at the expense oi ans
other. The management ot the

method. which untortunately. has
proven very unsatistactory, The
number drawing. followed by the
lecture course committee. was
omitted. and it was made possible
for enterprising individuals who
rose early and secured places at
the head of theline.to buy tickets
for all who were willing to pay
them the mere triﬂe. I2” cents
per ticket, tor so doing. About a
hundred ticlrets were purchased
in this way by the ﬁrst twoin line.
while those behind stood patient
ly by. watchingthe tickets for the
best seats disappear. We do not
see that any blame is to be put
upon those who did this. because
it was simplya part of the system
and advertisedl as such by the
management. The plan itseli.
however. is a decidedly unfair one.
and is out of harmony with the
spirit that prevails here. We are
very glad that the seat sales for
the
lecture course and the Glee Club
and Orchestra concert are to be
conducted according to the sys
tern winch has been developed
through years of experience.
