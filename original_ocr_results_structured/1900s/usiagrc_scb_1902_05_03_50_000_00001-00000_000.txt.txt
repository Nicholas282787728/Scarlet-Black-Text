IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL, IOWA, SATURDAY, MAY 3, 1902.

 

A DESPERATE GAME.

Aitcr Eleven innings of championship
Eall Knox Loses to Grim-toll by
Score or 4 to 3,

Friday afternoon was an ideal
day for base ball—sufﬁciently
warm for both players and tans
and hardly a breath or air stirring.
A hard game was expected with

Knox aiid the hundred or so loyal i

rooters present were not disap-
pointed. Grinnell has a cham-
pionship team this year and all it
needs is the hearty support at the
student body, It is to be hoped
that the depressing ertect oi the
Iowa game will be counteracted
by the ﬁne wo'rk of yesterday
afternoon.

The game started with snap and
vigor. Knox went to bat ﬁrstand
was retired in one, two, three
order at First. Grinnell also was
blankedin herhalt'. Inthe second
half of the second inning Clarke
pounded out a tivo-bagger, Benson
rapped out ahit, Fillmore liew
out to right ﬁeld, and Schilling
made a single, scoring Clarke,
The next two men struck out, In
the 4th inning Knox bunched 4
hits and scored McMillan, making
the score I to I. No further
scoring was done till the last of
8th, when Cole iventto ﬁrst hit by
a pitched ball. Fisk walked, Marsh
negotiated a single, Cole scored
on a passed ball, King ﬂew out to
center scoring Fisk and Clark rc-
tired the side by aﬁy to rigiit
ﬁeld, Marsh having been thrown
out at second. In the ﬁrst of the
9th Knox again bunched her hits
and ran intwo scores, tying the
score at 3-3. Neither side scored
in the mm. In the nth, Benson
was hit by a pitched hall and ad—
vanced by timely hitting crossed
the home plate winning the game
tor Grinnell by a close score ot 4
to 3.

The game was muchmore satisa
iactory in every waythan the Iowa
game of last week. Knox defeat-
ed Iowa on Thursday by a score
or s to 2. Clark pitched giltacdg-
ed ball. being as steady and reli.
able in the Ioth and 11th innings
as at the opening or the game. No
tault could be tound with any
member oi the team. The dispo-
sition to go to pieces at critical
times, so lamentably manifest in
the Iowa game, was entirely lack.

 

ing.

The Knox aggregation are
ball players from start to ﬁnish.
The game with them at Galesburg
next Saturday Will be watched
with considerable interest.

Postlude,

NEXT WEEK'S LECTURES.

Professor Herbert L. Willet, of
the University of Chicago. will
lecture in the Congregational
churcii next week, beginning Mon
evening. Mi. Willet comes to us
very highly recommended tor his
clear and powertui presentations
of Biblical characters, and those
here wiio have heard him declare
it a great treat to hear one of such
rare ability. The Young Men’s
and Young Women's Christian As-
sociations have secured him at a
large expense, but it has been
made possible to give the week's
lectures witlioutany charge for ads
mission. The ﬁrst lecture will be
given Monday evening at 7:30 and
it is hoped that the students will
arrange their work so that they
can attend all if possible.

 

THE WASHBURN DEBATE.

GrinneII Loses to Washhurn by a Vote
of 2 to 1.7A Good chate
in Every Rcspcct.

Another intercollegiate debate
is history and although Grinnell
was defeated, her representatives
were in no sense disgraced. A
more systematic effort than ever
before was made to win victory
for the scarlet and black and even
though Washburn received the
decision, the contest was by no
means oncasided and the visitors
earned their victory. Victory or
defeat, it was hoped that this
year would mark a change in the
interest in debating at Iowa Col-
lege and that hope is unchanged.
In this sense the debate was a
victory that marks the beginning
at such preparation for debates
that victories must ﬁnally come.
From Griuilell will
learn how to win victories, One
debate lost does not mean that
the next one will be lost, but that
greater effort will be made to
change the record next year. We
have the men and they have the
brains and with the spirit of
never-surrender the time is sure
to come when Grinnell will take a
higher place in intercollegiate de-
baring.

Before a moderate sized audi-
ence, which attended closely“'te
every word oi the speakers, Wed-
nesday evening at the Congrega-
tional church, occurred the second
annual debate between Wasliburn
college, ot Topeka, Kansas, and
Grinncll. The question was:

Ruck/ed, That all executive
duties in the cities of the United
States should be vested in tne
mayor, and that his appointments
should not require conﬁrmation.

The judges were Judge L. G.
Kinne, ot Des Moines, Judge H.
E. Deemer, of Red Oak, and
Judge T. L. Norvai, oi Lincoln.
Nebraska. Each speaker was
given twelve minutes tor direct
debate and ﬁve minutes for re-
buttal, excepting that the last
speaker on each side received ten
minutes tor rebuttal. The pro.
gram was opened by the college
Glee Club.

Both sides went at the question
in a way that showed long pre-

paration and thorough acquaint-
