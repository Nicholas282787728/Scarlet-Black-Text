THE LITERARY SOCIETIES.

Much Carerul Work Being Done in the
SocietieseProgram or Gnn'
nell Institute

Although they are not publicly
advertised, the literary societies of
Iowa College are thoroughly alive
and are doing aciive work. The
societies offer splendld opportuni-
ties for development along certain
lines and contribute a very deﬁnite
part to the college liie. Literary
society work, like any other work
in the college is in preparation for
the serious life that is to follow
graduation. No one who wishes
to gain the best the college has to
offer can afford to neglect this
work and that most students
recognize this is evinced by the
fact that nearly all otthe most
thoro students are members of
some literary society, As a rule
the work done hereisofa high
grade’. The aim of all the societies
is to develop by practice some
degree of grace and ease in public
speaking and the work done is
very valuable in attaining this end.

A series of typical programs oi
the fourcollege andtwo academy
societies will be published in the
SCARLET & BLACK beginning with

LECTURE COURSE.

The tickets for the Y. M.‘ C. A
lecture course to be given in the
Colonial are now in the hands of
the Committees and the sales are
not occurring as fast as they
should. The tickets for six num
bers sell at 51,50 which makes the
cost of each number twentyeﬁve
cents, Such entertainments as
these are not often to be had at
such a price and any one of them.
if it alone were to be attended
would cost ﬁfty cents. Many
people who really intend to pur—
chase tickets, keep putting the
matter off till the time of the ﬁrst
lecture. This leaves the lectbre
course committee in doubt as to
the supportthe course will receive
and also makes it difﬁcult to meet
the current expenses. The tickets
will Cost the same amount now or
later and it will be of considerable
help to the committee in charge
if the tickets are bought now, or
at least ordered so that they may
know what to expect. The ﬁrst
number, the lecture by Rabbi
Hirsch, willbe given in two weeks
and a half and will be one of the
strongest of the course.

ATHLETIC UNION,

The secretary of the union has
received a snug little sum from
members of the last year’s gradue
ating class who voted to pay athe
letic union dues each year. Afew
more payments such as this and
the debt will be no longer an ob
ject of constant worry. Some of
the young women oi the college
are also helping the union in this

way,

THE TEAM OFF FOR AMES.

This morning the team left for
Amos over the Iowa Central. The
requisite number signed the lists
and a rate of $1.50 round trip was
secured, tickets good till Monday.
A fair crowd attended the team,
and the men will receive support
from the meters, on the Ames
ﬁeld. The heavy ﬁeld will be a
drawback, but every man goes in-
to the game this afternoon pree
paredto do his best. The men are
in good shape and will play the
last half better thanthe ﬁrst, Ames
has made every possible effort to
win and the game will no doubt
be one of the best of the season
for both teams.‘ ' '

 

THE HANDICAP MEET FOST-

This will give the men ans

make the meet even
closer and more interesting than
before. Considerable interest is
evinced in the outcome of the 100
yard clash, in which twenty-one
men are entered, the handicaps
ranging from two and one half to
thirteen yards. The ﬁfty yard
dash for new men who do not win
places will also be interesting.
Owing to the fact that there is no
outeof~towngame, for the scrubs a
number of men in the squad will
probably take part in the meet.

come to hand. Such men as
senator George F. Hoar. Frank
B. Sanborn, Edward Everett Hale
and our own alumnus, James
Irving Manatt, spoke eloqently
and wisely on that occasion, and
no man has received more ﬂatter»
ing press notices than Dr, Manatt
and no one deserved the eulogy
better than he. It was a great
occasion and neither Iowa nor
Iowa College will blush when its
western born oratory is compared
with the best of the eastern.
