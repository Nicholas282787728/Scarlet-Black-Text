T the meeting ot the debating
team this evening an ex-
periment will begin which will be
watched with interest by students
of other colleges as well as our
At that meeting H. H.
Stipp, '96, ot DesMoines, will be-
‘gin work with the team in the
capacity of debating coach. The
work of the debating coach was
clearly set forth in the article
quoted sometime ago from the
Harvard Crimwzz, and need not
be repeated here That the re
sults of the work of the debating
coaches in the large universities
are satisfactory cannot be ques~
tioncd. Whether the results here
will be equally Satisfactory re-
mains to be seen, but there is
good reason to believe they will.
The present team is composed
ct men, who are good students.
keen thinkers, hard workers. and
who have had experience in inter-
collegiate debates. Mr. Stipp is
in every way qualiﬁed _to assist
them in preparing for the contest
with Washburn. He not only
was a leader in debating circles
while in college here, but was one
of the most prominent men in
this work, while taking his pro-
fessional coursein Harvard. The
men of the team have the great
est conﬁdence in Mr, Stipp, and
he in return is directly interested
in the-team, so that the college
has a right to expect some good
work in the debate next April,

The securing of a coach is an ex
periment hut SCARLET AND BLACK
believes that the societies have
done wisely in taking this step.
The defeat of our teams in the
past has not been due to a lack of
eifort on the part of the men, so
much as to a lack ct knowledge
ot how to prepare their debates
in the most effective way. The
duty of the coach will be to sup
ply this need, and there can be no
reasonable doubt that it will be
well done. Interest in debating
is slowly, but surely increasing in
Grinnell, and any effort to in»
crease the efﬁciency of the de-
baters should be gladly welcomed
by the students. Our record is
not an especially inspiring one,
astlle world goes, and yet we have
no reason to be ashamed of it.
The application at the spirit
which prevails in our athletic con»
tests coupled with hard work and
good coaching is sure to bring
ultimate victory for the scarlet
and black.
