D'RAKE vs GRINNELL

On accountot the lateness of
the game today at Ward Field,
SCARLET and BLACK cannot give
nnaccountotitlnthisissue. There
is no doubt however but that a
good exhibition ot ball is being
watched as we go to press, The
Drake team is under independent
management this year and it has
a large and loyal following at
home. Drake is rully up to their
usual standard and Grinneli is not
below hers, The records of the
two aggregations show Grinnell
to havethelongendottlicchances
for today but comparisons never
give any certainty. This game
however may be the means or
