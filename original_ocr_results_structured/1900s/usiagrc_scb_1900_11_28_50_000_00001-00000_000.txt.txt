inations. All cases of fraud are
passed upon by the Student Counr
cil and in case of conviction re
ferred to the Faculty for ﬁnal
action. The system was thoroughv
ly discussed at the mass meeting
last Monday evening but it is de~
sired to have the ‘expression or
the whole student body. and to
this end ballots will be mailed to
every student in the college.
The answcrs as to whether you
favor the system and whcther you
will report cases of cheating or
not, must be in by Tuesday, Dec.

The Merits of the Honor System.

The great merit of the Honor
System is that it dispenses with
faculty surveillance and makesthe
students directly responsible for
the honesty oIcIassrroom exams
inations. No system will entirely
do away with dishonesty, but this
system will accomplish the most
good in this direction with the
minimum of objectionable fear
tures. Its effectiveness lies in the
fact that some will not cheat while
on their honor, and that those who
would use iraud anyway. are de-
terred from so doing by the pres
ence or persons all around them
who will report any dishonesty.
In fact the Crucial test of the et‘ﬁr
ciency or the system lies in the
willingness to report. A person
who cheats in examination harms
himself, exerts an injurious inﬂu-
once upon the morally immature,
and loweres the moral tone of the
whole institution, It isamistaken
idea of personal loyalty which
prompts one to shield such an act,
for the one who commits the deed,
if not caught, is encouraged by
his success to further deeds of a
like nature. The contention that
the deterring or the act of cheat-
ing does not beneﬁt the individual
is unsound, because it ignores the

psychological fact that habit has
quite as mtrch to do with moral
life as principle The moral re~

 

sponsihility cannot be sllifted.altd
the failure of a single individual
to report is not a fztilule ofthc sys~
tcm but a failure of the individual.

The ﬁrst twoyears during which
this system was tried rt was man-
ircstly of considerable beneﬁt and
a great advance upon the experi-
ence of previous years. Last
year the attainment ofthe best re
sults greatly hampered
by unfavorable conditions, and it
is unfair to take it as a criterion.
A realization oi responsibility is
necessary, and anyone with any
moral strength should be willing
to shoulder his part of this re-
sponsibility for the sake of the
general good which would result.

The Weakness of the Honor

system.

Iowa College students are. on
the average, intelligent and have
some moral conceptions. It the
Honor System is a good thing.
why does it not ﬁnd itself in bar
mony with the student body? Is
there, then, not something wrong
with the system itself? Many of
the students believe that there is
something petty and in a way de~
grading in such a system. Tire
reeling that you are continually in
the mind of your fellow as a pos.
sible cheater, and. moreover, the
knowledge that you yourself must
be ever ready to detect a sin in
your fellow, is at once unchari-
table to the other and degrades
your own innate feeling of self-
respect. There is in everyone a
spirit of iairn'ess. of highrminded-
ness. The thing essential is the
means to draw it out, The Honor
System does not do this. Rather
it stiﬂes it in an air of suspicion,

The best resultsin a classroom
are obtained by fully trusting a
student and by letting him know
that you trust him. His spirit of
fairness and honor will. in nine
cases out of ten, arise to meet the
conﬁdence reposedin him. More-
over, the system is impractical.
Professors are complaining of
the lack of charges of cheating.
Last year btrt three cases were
brought before the Student Coun-
cil and these charges were all pro»
ferrcd by the professors them
selves. Not one student reported
on another.

Those who still favor it. say that

 

whrle the system does not prevent
cheating, yet it prevents
cheating than any other system.
This is a mistake. There is con-
slant cheating and lots of It. In
a recent examination a dozen stu-
dents had their notebooks open.
No charges were preferred, how.
ever. Two students were recently
overheard to say that they would
vote for the Honor System, be
cause under that system cheating

All Abuard for Des Moines!

There are plenty of good
reasons 'why the football team
should be accompanied to Des
Moines. tomorrow by a large and
enthusiastic delegation of rooters,
ifGrinnetlhad no possible chance
to win It would be only right that
men who have been as faithful to
their trust as have those Compass
in; the team of 1900. should rer
cerve loyal support. No school
can hope to win it it retuses to
support its athletic organizations
in defeat. Our colors should be
seen on every hand in Des Moines
tomorrow and our yells made to
echo through the streets of the
capital city. no matter what the
result of the game, Anyone can
yell in the hour of triumph but
only patriots will sound their war
cries under the sting of deteat.

But it is no toregone conclu-
sion that we shall lose. Under
“Jack’s ” skillful care nearly all
the men have been brought to the
very pink of physical condition.
The ’Varsity will start the game
with its regular line up and while
one or two of the men may not
last through the contest, good
substitutes will be on hand to
take their places. Grinnell has
better team work and a more
varied attack than at any time
during the season and may be
counted upon to gain a good bit
or ground unless Drake .has a
more stubborn defense than re—
ports indicate. The clear weather
at the past three days has done
much to dry the ﬁeld and it is be-
lieved it will be hard and fast by
Thursday afternoon. No matter
what the result, Grinnell's team
will be a credit to the school. 'It
deserves support. Let us see
that it has it. ,
