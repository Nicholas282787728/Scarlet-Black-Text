Improvements About the
Campus.

Plans are on foot and
executed In the future for
providing better and more per
manent sidewalk facilities about
the campus. The board wall
from Chicago Hall to Alumni
Hall will be taken up and
placed by one built of sawed
stone; not, howcvcr-, in its present
form, but,in the shape of an
ellipse with the curve running
just below the steps ot Blair Hall,
From this walk a straight cinder
path will be built uortlrwatd, runs
ning west of the men's gymnasium
and curving around to meet the
crossing already built there across
the street. From the north and
south side entrances oi the gym
short board walks lvill be built to
the cinder path. It is thought
these board lvalks will prevent
considerable mud and dirt ll'om
being carried into the building.
Incidentally this cinder path will
furnish a straight away course
tully a hundred yards long.

Work on the new trackin Ward
Field will not begin until next
spring. Planswerctullydevelop-
’ed and tunds provided. but no
laborers could be procured to
undertake the work this fall.

Is.
Liquid Arr.

It is probably sate to say that
the Y. M. C. A. lecture to be
given next Friday evening will
prove of more general interest
than any that has been given in
Gl'innell [or a number of years.
Liquid air possesses so many re-
marltable properties that the em
perirnents which will he performs
ed will in themselves prove very
entertaining. But more than
that, the practical uses to which
liquiﬁcd air may be applied, are
so many and valuable as to make
it a matter concerning which every
intelligent person should be in~
formed. Prof. Woodland, who
presents the subject here, has
been for a number of years a
science teacher, and the lecture
promises to be at real scientiﬁc
value.

Mr. Tripler. who has made pos-
sible a general use of liquid air by
ﬁnding a process by which it can
be cheaply iormcd, claims that by
.nrcans of it the temperature of a
lioom may be easily reduced; that

it will prove of value commercial-
iy {or rctrigratiun; that it has
various uses in medicine and sure
t;cl'y; that it is a poweriul e

plosive; and that it will prove in.
valuable tor pnrposes of motive
power. Such subjects as these
will be discussed in the lecture.

 

 

which cannot fail to prove of
value to those who hear it.

The Honor System.

By a very decisive vote thc stu-
dents or Iowa college have dccid
ed against the Honor System”

i

rOuly i6: votes were cast. and ni'

these no were opposed and 52 in
(avor oithe system. In counting,
only those straight ballots which
both favored thcsystcnr and promr
iscd torcport were counted in the
aFﬁtmativc, while all split ballots
which either favored the systenr'
but would not report. or would re
port but did not tavor the system
werecountcdintlrenegattve. The
vote is a rlissapointment in several
respects. The smallvote polled
shows an indritcrence among the
students, which in itself is fatal to
the success of the system. while
the fact that only 52 out of about
262 in the college department
would actively support the systenr
is certainly to be deplored. It
was :ire almost unanimous opinion
at the mass meceting that a two-
thirds afﬁrmative vote would be
necessary for the best working of
the system. The Honor system
in examinations was inaugurated
by the students. has been conduct-
ed entirely as a student movement.
and this vote conclusively shows
that the students do not care to
continue the system any longer.
The Faculty have considered the
vote decisive and hereafter they
will bear all responsibility tor dis.
honesty in examinations.

May Festival.

Too mu'ch credit cannot be giv»
en to Prof. Cole for his tlntiring
efforts to obtain good musical con-
certs for Grinnell audiences.
Every year we have one or more
high class concerts due to his in-
ﬂuenceandindustry. Nextspring,
about the ﬁrst of May, we will
again be indebted to Prof. Cole.
A May Festival will be given, cone
sisting of three concerts. The
Chicago Symphony Orchestra, as-
sisted by a local chorus of sixty
voices, will produce two evening
concertsandan atternoonmatinec.
For one of the concerts Mendelsr
sohn‘s “Elijah" will be given.
Mendelssohn spent nine years up
on this production and it is his
most tamous. The opportunity
we shall have otseeing it will sure-

 

ly be a greatfreat.
