THE VESPER SERVICE.

New Departure in College Services.

Not the least element in whatis
known as the Grinliell spiiit is the
feeling that each member ofthe
college stands for the whole, that
his interests are to a large extent
identiﬁed with those of a large
body oi people. To say that this
is the ﬁnest element in our college
liie is a commonplace.

It is not easy to say from what
source has sprung this spirit of
unity. It is certain, however, that
our daily chapel service, simple
as it. is, has done much toward
fostering it. The voluntary unite
ing of so large a portion ot our
student body in a common exer
else would have tremendous force,
even if the exercise in itself were
of slight value. It has long been
thought that this feeling of college
unity would manifest itself still
more if there could be a similar
assembling or our whole college
community, faculty and students,
at a time when we are freer from
the pressure of work, and when a
little more care and thought could
be put into the service.

The task of arranging a service
in which all may join, whatever
their relationship to the religious
life of the college is not an easy
one, and it is hardly expected
that the plan ﬁnally adopted will
prove to be ideal. It is hoped,
however, that it will furnish an
atmospherethat may be genuinely
helptulto everyone, provided he
wtll approach it in an attitude of
hearty loyalty and cooperation.
This does not mean that criticism
of it is out of place. On the con-
trary criticism which will reach
those who lt’lve charge of tlit‘ ar
ranging oi the twice is qur'e in
the spirit of genuine cooperation
Changes in its Form will doubtless
be made from time to time. as we
learn irom experience what will be
best adapted in the iicecls of nut
college lite.

it is not intended that this serr
vice shall furnish an t)CC»)~‘ilin for
a formal address The ﬁlteeii or
twenty minutes talk will be simple
and direct, The ﬁrst meeting
will be held at Five o’clock Sunday
afternoon, Oct. 6. This service
will be in charge of Acting Presi~
dent Main.

The mustc WK 1 be olle of the
most important elements in the
service. The best effort of the
college Wlll be put into it, for it
is thought that it will contribute
perhaps more than anything else
to the creating of the sort of
spirit which this meeting should
have. A special chorus has been
arranged which will furilish the
basis of the music.

EDSON HOUSE GIRLS ENTERTAIN

entertained about one hundred
and ﬁfty of their young lady
friends at an “at home" party this
afternoon. The interior of the
house had been converted into an
autumn palace. The bright red
and gold leaves of autumn interr
mingled with the ﬂaming scarlet
and sombre black of the college
colors created an appearance
which seemed to make merry the
already light spirits of those who
Came.

A large honor G was suspended
behind the trappe bowl, where
the different hostesses took thin

itying tor the ﬁnal, were Conger,
scratch; Burnside Byards handi-
cap, Harvey, 6 yards; Nelson, 6
yards; Benson, 7% yards. The
ﬁnal was won by Burnside in the
satisfactory time of i2 3~5 seconds.
Although there were horas many
in the race as had been expected,
it was a good try out for the new

ment to all.

To the older students, at least,
this little statement, taken from
T/ie Daily [owmt’s comparisons of
the different teams, after last
Saturday’s games, will be or in-
terest. “Yale, too. who has been
sending out the most dismal tales
for the past month, until it seem»
