GRIDIRON PRACTICE BEGINS.

Ward Field rhc Scene of Greer Acrivliies
iFisk: Expnclcd Nexr WeekﬁThe
Schedule.

A goodly bunch oi brawny looking
iellows are now doing daily stunts on
Ward Field under the direction or
Trainer Fisher. The coaches Fisic

and Bergen hare not arrived yet but
Fiske is expected to come so as to take
charge nf the players the ﬁrst of next
week and Bergen will come later.

About thirty ﬁve have reported for
practice but more are expected out
next Week. Among the old men that
have donned uniiorms are Captain
Auracher, Muyskens, Clack, Samlnons,
J a q u a, McKean a n d McDonald.
Among the new men Valerius will
make a strong bid (or quarterback,
but it is diiilcult at present to tell
much about the material.

There seemsto be plenty or heavy
men however and it is more than like-
ly that candidates for the line will be
numerous. Light work has been the
order of the week and no uttemptS
have been made to line-up,

The schuduie is published below
and We believe that the management
has acted wisely in arranging games
with colleges more nearly the size or
Grinnell. Heretorore Grinneli w its
able to do battle with much larger
schools but that time has passed to a
great extent. We can no longer ex-
pect to meet such schools as the Un -
remit)! of Minnesota. or Nebraska and
do justice to ourselves. It is the
height or folly to attempt. it and the
management deserve commendation
forgiving up the games with those
schools. ,

Another noticeable feature is the
large number of home games. Here-
tofore the rooters had to be content
with one good game and a practice
game but this year there Will be tour.
This will give all an opportunity to
see some good football and to give the
team loyal support. The games with
Ames and Simpson will be ﬁerce ones
and the strongest kind of enthusiasm
will be needed to book the team.

Every man who has time ior root.
ball at all, should don a uniiorm and
report for practice. Grinnell needs a
good team this fall and depends on
every man to do his best. Get our.
and see what you can do. A winning
football team this season will restore
Grinnell to her former position among
the leaders in Iowa Athletics.

CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION WORK. l

The Y. M. C. A. Begins rhe Year Wllh
A Strong organizaricn_crrear Op-
poriuniuss for New Men

At the beginning oithe year every
new student is concerned with the
new opportuniries oiiered by the dir—

ferent student organizations through
Which he may come into closer con-
tact with his [allow students, and
which will help him to become a betw
ter and more developed man. Among
the diiierent organizations of men the
Y. M. C. A. stands pro-eminent in our
school.

The Young Men‘s Christian Associ-
ation is the largest student organiza-
tion among the men in college and the
men, who are doing the things worth
while in college, are the ones who give
their heartiest support to this organ-
ization.

The diiierent phases of work taken
up and olrered by the Y. M. C. A. are
Well worth the careful and considerate
attention of every man in school.
Bible study has been proven to be one
or the most popular studies attempted
in the past. The fact that over half
the men enrolled in school last year
were enrolled in Bible Study goes to
prove this (act. Mission Study is also
an important phase or the work and
n0 student should leave school With-
out having a knowledge of missions so
necessary to a Well rounded education.
The Y. iii. C. A. also conducts a
lecture course which will be better
than ever this year.

The prospects for the work in the
association are very bright. Hereafter
the headquarters Will be in the
new zoom on the second ﬂoor of Good
now Hall. Every new man should
feel ita privilege to take some part in
this work and thus help to make the
most successfulyear our Y. M. C. A.

has ever experienced.

THE CHAPEL SERVICES.

The Opening chapel service on
Wednesday morning demonstrated
more than words can tell the pressing
need nia new chapel. The room was
packed and even standing room was at
a premium.

The congested state of adairs has
existed at every service this week and
if the attendance is maintained. it
will be necessary ror the students to
take turns as the room cannot accom-
modate them all at one time.

The venerable Professor Parker conr
ducted the opening service and called
the attention 0f the students to the
responsibilities of American citizen
ship. On Thursday, Rev, E. M. V
tum of the Congregational church cr-
tended an invitation of Welcome to
the students from the oi zens of
Grinnell.

The Friday morning service was lead
by Dr. Steiner, and he spoke of his
travels during the sum mer, He paid a
ﬂattering tribute toGrinnell when he
said. that “Grinneil was not orer-
shadowed by Harvard.” He urged the
students to live the righteous life, but
not to live the Christian life in plots

The latest reports from the Iiegis.
trars Indicate that the highest hopes
of the friends of Iowa. College have
been realized and that from the pres-
ent outlook. Grinnell Will have the
largest College attendance in its his»
tory.

The attendance is due not. to any
special action on the part of the cole
legc but rather to the standing which
Grinnell enjoys among the colleges of

Iowa. Some of the pessimism had

predicted that on account of our stand
{or pure athletics that young men
would be turned away and attracted
to otller schools, but they will be sur-
prised to learn that the proportion
of men to women is greater than ever
before. It is one Oi the hopeful signs
that Iowa College is not going to be-
come oladies seminary as some had
feared.

The Freshman class numbers one
hundred and sixty three at present, it
record which surpasses all others by
far.

There are ninety eight Soplimores
registered and while the number is
about the same as usual, yet there are
more men than women in the class, a
condition of affairs which has never
existed since the famous class of 1900.
The Juniors come back full and strong
with ﬁfty eight, while the Seniors
number forty sex-eh. it is expected
that the Seniors will number about
sixty beiore graduation.

THE STUDENT RECEPTIONS.

New Srudcnrs Are Dclighriully Emer—
iained in Sociery Halls Friday
Aiiornoon and Evening.

Institute Hall was the scene last
evening of a most pleasant aﬁair. The
opening reception given by the Y. M.
C. A. to the new men was a Success
in every respect. This was the ﬁrst
real opportunity presented to new and
old to get acquainted and no time
was lost by either side in forming new
friendships. It is one of the pleasures
or college lire to greet the new men
and to initiate them into the myster-
ies of their surroundings.

The society hall has been the scene
of many a similar reception but never
beiore has a spirit or optimism and
good cheer pervaded the men as
seemed to exist last evening. The
speeches were more serious than are
accustomed to be made at such places
Yet the usual amount of Wit was not.
lacking.

Alter considerable time had been
spent in introductions and hand shak-
lugs, Mr. Lyman, oi the reception
committee, introduced Dean Main
who welcomed the men on behalf of
the college. His word of welcome was
rollowed by speeches by Dr. Steiner,

Professor Stoops and Professor Peck

THE W My RECEPTION.

In accordance with the long estab-
lished custom the young women or the
Christian Association held their re-
ception Friday arternoon between the
hours of four-thirty and sir in Calo-
oagathieu hall. This event is prob-
nbly the best opportunity adorded
whereby the new and old students
and laculty ladies may become ac«
quainted. The plan of old students
escorting new ones was used this year-
as iormerly. The afternoon was
almost entirely spentin meeting stu- '
dents. Some music was iurnished by
the committee in charge and dainty
reireshrnenrs were served in Ellis
hall.

The spirit oi the college is shown in
the interesttaken by all the war en of
the institution in these receptions.
Each seemed to feel a personal respon-
sibility that she should attend and do
her part in acquaintiug herseli with
new students and in helping them
to reel at home.
