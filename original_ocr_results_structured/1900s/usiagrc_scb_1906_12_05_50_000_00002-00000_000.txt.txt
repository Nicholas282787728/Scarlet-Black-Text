Inquiries have been made lately as
to whether or not the columns of the
ScrtiiLls'r 8: BLACK are open to coul-
municntiens from undergraduates. It
is the recognived right or students to
publish their ideas in this Way and the
practice Will not be discontinued.
Frequently there are matters which
need comment which are better known
to people not on the stair oi the paper
and such comment, as long as it is
honest and sincere. is invited. It is
customary for such communications
to be published over the signature DI
the author, the reason thereIor being
obvious. IL is necessary at least that
the editors know the author or any
communications published. Incidentv
ally, it is much better form tor those
who are subscribers to avail them-
selves of the privilege, though the
management alone is aware of whether
or not they are so.

In consideration 01 the present rush
of social functions and other events
attendant upon the season. it appears
Wise that there should be some hesita-
tion as to carrying out plans for the
proposed football reception, Not only
are studies beginning to interfere
with college work but the demands
upon OJe's time for periormance of

merous as to cause Conflicts The time
is already more than ﬁlled and any ot-
tompt to increase the already uurner.

The ireshmen oI Grlunell Institute
took part in a Preliminary debate

the second intersuciety debate. The
question was, resolved, that in cities
iuthe United States or over 100,000
population the executive and ad-
ministrative powers should be vested
in the mayor, the comptroller and
creasurer to be elected independently
and the veto power to be granted the
mayorasalegielative iunction. All
the men did their work in a very
creditable rnauncr, especially in con-
sideration DI the dilllculby and com-
plication oi the subiect. The, places
were awarded as iollows: Murphy ﬁrst,
H. Bruudase second, Lockwood third,
Clark alternate. The ﬁrst excelled
in delivery and was the choice or all
for the place. Clark showed
celleut preparation and had a good
outline outfailed in an attempt at
an :extempordneous speech. Lock~
wood's speech was learned entirely
and though delivered Loo slowly was a
good ell'ort. All the markings were
close. Asatealu the men will put

upa strong debate and the second
contest or the year promises to be
Very interesting. The judges were
