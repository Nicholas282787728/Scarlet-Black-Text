THE COE GAME.

The second college game to occur on

evening with Get as the opposing team.
A hard game had not been predicted
by [he [uilowers of the sports and chair
expectations weiei'uiiy satisﬁed. BoLh

eight o‘clock and \lel‘e greeted by a
small and coirlalldrence. TimLIeeiing
of conﬁdence which had been so much
in evidence throughout was responsi»

Tire gariic was in the hands of the
home team from the ﬁrst. minute of
play and nt. no time was an adverse

and general lack of smooth team work
