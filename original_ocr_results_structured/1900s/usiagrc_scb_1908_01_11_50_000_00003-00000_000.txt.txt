Among "I0 Stimulus.

Many of the students were joyfully
surprised on attending Chnpel Tucs-
dm- morning, to see the space reserv
ed for an organ in :. dismantled cons
dition and the ﬁrst thought was that
an instrument had been secured for
the place.

President Naill explained to the slur
dent body at Chapel yesterday morn.
ing the circumstances which made
possible the scouring oi an instru-
nlellL for Iowa College at this partic-
ular Lime. Somo sir weeks ago Press
idcut Main received a letter from Pro'
iossor munch, formerly director at
the School of Music, hut now head of
the Lyon & iioah- organ depot-uncut,
that the him was going out of the
hnsiuoss of handling organs and that
a ﬁne instrumcut built to demonstrate
the ﬁrms ability and almost an exoct
ﬁt lor the space rescrvcd in the Chapel
could be secured at a very rcashnnblo
price. The. matrcr was considered for
n time (lull ﬁllztll' [lie Women's clubs
oi Gl'illuell were oshcd to unpu- lllcll'
iunds toward the purchnsc oi the or-
gan, which would cost $5,000. This
they agreed to, although they did not

 

loci able to provide the entire amount.

Dur‘ .z the holidays the executive

such that it could not be roiuscd, and
the purchase nus made. 0.. last Tucs-
day President Minn nccompcnicd Rev.
Suclmw to Manchester to interview a
Citizen oi that place who was intei»
ested in the proposition, and gore liis
verbal promise to stand the complete
cost of the organ and installation.
Thus the organ is assured and will be
in place and ready by the middle of
February. The instrument will he one
oi the best in lows, and will be it
great addition to the Chapel exercises.
The cost or the organ, made especially
tor the Chapel, would have been about
$10,000; but as the ﬁrm is retiring
from business the olier of $5,000 was
made. The College is particularly
iortuuute in securing such an excel.
lent proposition. The organ will he
