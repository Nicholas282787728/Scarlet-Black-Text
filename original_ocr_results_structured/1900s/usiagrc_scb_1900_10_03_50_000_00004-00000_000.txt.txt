The football management feels
that an apology is due tor keep-
ing thepuhiic so long in the dark
regarding the season’s schedule.
Other managers in the state an-
nounced their schedules eaiiy
alter the opening or their respec-
tive schools. Gl'inrtell would cer-
tainly not have been behind the
times in this matter had notan
unavoidable delay in Ft.
two dates made an earlier publir
cation of the complete schedule
impossible. The schedule as given
above, however, is complete and
can he relied upon.

It. will be noticed that athletic
relations have been resumed with
Drake and that the ﬁrst game
takes place next Friday evening
at Des Moines. The game will
be an innovation in this state, in
that it will be played by electric
light. Forty arcs strung around
the side-Iines,togetlier ivith head-
lights set to make high punts eas—
ily seen by both players and spec-
tators. are expected to make the
grounds as light as day, The

 

scheme is an experiment in a way,
and should it prove successful
from an athletic and ﬁnancial
point ot View, night games may
become a regular feature of the
Iowa football season.

Another game on the schedule
which will excite remark is the
Iowa City game. it will he played
at Iowa City this year, although
by precedence it would ordinarily
be played in Grinnell. This are
rangement was made for the mu-
tual convenience ot Iowa City.
Grinnell and Amesv Hitherto,
Grinnell, tor instance. had two big
games on her home grounds with
Antes and Iowa City one year.
The followingyearshe had neither
of these games at home. Grin»
nell’s case was identical with that
of Iowa City’s in this respect. As
the games are now arranged. each
of the three schools will have one
of the three games between them»
selves on the home grounds once
a year. The advantage of this
scheme is apparent at a glance.

Another feature of the schedule
is the games arranged tor the sec
ond team. A good “scrub" team
is always necessary to asuccesstui
'Varsity. and the services of the
“scrubs” should be recognized.
The lot of a scrub is a hard om: :it
best. and the management has ens
deavored to make possible some
kind of reward [or all their hard
knocks and bruises, The schedule
at present contains three games.
More may be added later. Nor is
the third team to be torgotten.
Their season will open with a
game against the Brooklyn high
school on Ward Field, Saturday.
at 3 p. m.. and, the management
ivill endeavor to arrange other
contests if the candidates main-
tain proper interest.

The schedule is an unusually
hard one, embracing tour state
universitiesalld offering three long
trips, besides several short ones,
Theseopportunities ought to keep
alive football enthusiasm during
the entire season. If such is not
the case, the hopes and aims of
the football management will not
be fulﬁlled.
