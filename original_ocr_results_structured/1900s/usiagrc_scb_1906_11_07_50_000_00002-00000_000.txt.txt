Bible Hour.

The ﬁrst of the Bible Hours was
observed from eleven uutil twelve
o’clock on Friday morning, led by
Miss Kirk, Secretary oi the Associa-
tion at Sioux City and Bible Secretary
01' the state. Miss Kirk tool: the place
of Miss Elizabeth Wilson, Secretary of
the Seoretaries’ Training Bureau of
Chicago, who was unable to be present.

Miss Kirk took for he? sllbyect “The
Holy Spi L”, which slle said iuust aid
us in fulﬁlling the mission of our lives,
and considered tlie'work of the )irit
as being threefold: to reveal Christ
to us, to reveal Christ in us, and iilr~
ally to reveal Him tilru us.

Christ can be most periectly
vealed in His disciples, because only
a character can reveal ti character.
AS Christ reveals the Father SO must
we reveal Cllrlsi'r, Iol‘ belng revealed in
in us, He attracts others. “'9 reveal
Christ by having in our lives the quail-
ities which made His life beautiful.

Finally, we must let Christ be re
vealed Lllru us by service and the se-
cret oreilective serlice is a constant
Close touch with Him.

In brief, the three-[old Work Oi the
Holy Spirit brings a Vision, the trans-
formation of our lives and service.

The talk was very llelplul in i
simplicity. earnestness and spiritua -
ity. The iiieetiug closed with player
by the leader.

to come to the Association licoms and
and feel at home there, In Cedar
Rapids, on the contrary. they do not

would come. Tile girls ire very en-
thusiastic and come in crowds. They

take cure notlo put the iiictory girls
oil by themselves, but all Sorts and
conditions of gills meet in the Associ-
atlou Rooms, and the mingling is
good ior botli. An Extension Com-
mittee has proved very helpful to the
Extension Secretary and are being
trained meanwhile for independent
work. in Ottumwu they have no
Extension Secretary, but practical ex-
tension work was begun through the
appeal or a West End pastor. A gym-
nasium class has been organized and
Bible classes Will follow soon. Also at
the packing house talks are given
every Wednesday noon to ironiaito
150 girls.

The second topic was Traveler’s
Aid, None of the Associations repre-
sented carry on this work, but in
Sioux City the Methodist Deaconess’
Home has done agreat deal of very

successful work along this line. In
some places cards in the station in-

crease largely tlie number or strangers
coming to the rooms.

Third, local papers, the advertising
can usually be made to pay {or a little
lortnightly or monthly publication
containing Association news and
announcements. On the whole, how-
ever, Association notes in the daily
papers oi the city are more desirable,
as reaching more people and present-
ing news more olten. A newsletter
sent once a month by the National
Committee and printed in this depart,—
lneut would be helpful and interest—
lug.

Miss Mcnli-oy, oi Bombay, India,
occupied the last lifteen minutes of
the hour, speaking on the Relation of
Local Associations to the World's Y.
W. C. A. Her words were an earnest
and powerlul appeal ror the cooperav
tion of lndividval organivations with
this great indtlstl'al movement. Fair-
ness requires our interest in the

world‘s work. l'oi- ir Y. w. c. A. has

Sludcnl Conference, ‘

Miss Ilerlsildw took as the central‘
thought DI the coniel‘ence Acts 1: 8:-
“But yesliidl receive power. when the
Holy Spirit is come upon you; and ye'
shall be my witnesses both in Jerusa-l
lem and all .llldea and Samaria, and
onto the utlerlllost partoi the earth.”
Our association work must be progres-
sive. A re we advancing? We must

.\ r'rrzllxuos.

 

urst have phony. What is the scopeol‘

the work? In our own college ﬁrst,
then out to the iittermost parts oitile ,
world. Christ’s liie is the greatest or
211 lives, and We are his ambassadors.
We must lirst wait upon our Lord,_
and have thorough preparation. Then}
when the Power comes it will show
itsoli in us as wituesses in three ways.
In what we are, in what we say.
in what, we‘do.

The strongest efiolt is personal.
When we start in Bible classes, we
realize that not only a public meet-
ing is necessary, but individual work.
It takes more courage to talk person-
ally to people than to speak general-
ly in a meeting. It is not enough ior
us to try to show our Christ by our
lives. Are we honorably exempt irorn
the duty or telling others or the
source oi our happiness? It is tant-
alizing ior a girl to see a peace and a
joy in anotller's life which she wants
tor her seli and not know the source.

Miss Ott of Cedar Falls presented
the organization side or the associa-

tion. The purpose or organizing is to

win girls to Christ. To do this, we
must choose spiritual girls for the re-

sponsible positions. Keep in mind
the character oieaciigirl asyou choose
her for (I. committee member. l’ut her
on the committee she is particularly
adapted to. Have some strong and
some weak girls on each committee.

The policy should contain the aim,
that oi winning girls in its own wily.
Have a regular committee meeting
each month, and ii the girls aren’t
there ﬁnd out wily they are not.
There should be as much time spent
in prayer (ls possible.

Alumnze ConferenceiAddress by Rev.
G. L. Cady.

Society has invested d. great deal in
a college girl. There are 160,000 stu-
dents, and an annual expenditure or
3 00,000. lVith so much greater in—
stitutions than one hundred years ago,
the grade of men and women should
be so much the better. in 1340 there
were no institutions or learning open
to women. Today there lire 170 worn-
an's colleges, besides many coeduca-
tioual schools. TlleAmerican woman
has every door thrown open to her.

Society does not demand that wom~
an invade man’s sphere nor become a
social leader. The poorest return a
college girl can give the world is to be
admired by society. Responsibility is
commensurate With endowment. A
college woman must put her education
to better use, remembering that edu-
cation is a means, not an end.

Again, ii woman is not expected to
join the third sexithe ranks or the
New “onion. Man cannot light to
bring God’s kingdom upon earth with—
out woman‘s help. There are splendid
examples or women who do not marry,
but mother the entire worldmsLICll i
women as L l‘ances Willard and Julie
Addams but they are the exception,

Woman‘s business is to teach the
World the ﬁrst values. Her business
is to keep alive the tenderer part of
life A woman cannot give the best
to the “mid unless she keeps herself
distinctively a woman. l

'Cllilirman introduced the speaker oi

“if ye abide in me and my words abidelI
in you, ye shall ask what ye will and
it shall bedooo unto you." llecn»
larged upon this theme in a way which

 

showed the power of prayer in the lilo
oi n Christlun. rliter tracing the lie
velopnlcot or scientiﬁc discovery in
pust centuries and showing tile hear-
ing it has had upon the worlds belief
in God, he also demonstrated that ill
spite or learned scientiﬁc and philo-
sophic objections to the value of
prayer, it has remained a great. factor
in the liie oi humanity. Everywhere
that, man is found his religion, what-
ever in is, has in some form the use of
prayer as a strong element. This pow-
er of prayer has ﬁxed because men
have come to recognize the lact that
God does answer prayer Why should
not God answer prayer? He is the
Heavenly Father, and just as the
earthly father is anxious to give his
children the things they really desire,
he is waiting to answer our call for
help.

The full power of may er has not yet
been tested, because we have not yet
Iuliy realized the extent of the power
of Christianity. As long as our relig-
ion continues to grow and develop, so
long will its new beauties anti re-
so nice: or power come to light. Each
one o[ these means something more
which can be attained through the
power ol’ prayer.

Tile llu man individual is not the on-
ly one who is anxious to see pl'ayel
used. Not only does God want. us to
give ourselv es to him through prayer,
but he is ready and Willing to give
Himself to us through the same
medium. Only when this is uppreciu~
ted will the full power of communica-
tion between God and man be realized.
Not only are we to be guided by the
more material and tangible things
which come as answers to our players,
but the very spirit of God which copies
must be a large element in tile belles
fits which accrue.

Miss Mary Carpenter, llean oI Wolnen
