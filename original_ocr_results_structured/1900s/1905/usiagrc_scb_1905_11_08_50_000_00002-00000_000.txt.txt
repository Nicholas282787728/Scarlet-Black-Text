ed an overwhelming defeat, but tiie
team or the institution was not dis-
graced. Do not sulkin your tent or
begin to criticize. Tile season is not
over and we have yet to meet one of
our strongest Opponents. One neieat
does not signify that we sliztllbede-
feaLed by all other schools. Iowa has
defeated us continually for twelve
years and yet we have won other
games,aud even with this handicap
have made a creditable showing in
lowa football circles. Stand by the
team and give the players the support
which they deserve. Victory is not
the only thing which counts in a game.
It is so easy to knock, especially in
times of misfortune.

it is reported that aeounic or Grinv

The latest football casualty is relat-
ed by ll. neighboring paper ill the fol-
lowing words which contain it wealth
of information which does not appear

We wish IA) inform the I. S. C. Siti-
dent of Ames that Iowa College played
Drake on October 28, and not Simpson
as they announced in their columns.
If We remember correctly it was the
Iowa State College of Agriculture and
Mechanic Arts which met Simpson
on that Saturday. It is all right this
time but We don’t want to take the
glory of that game, although we do
need a little Something just at pres-
out.

A Grinncll alumnus was heard to
remark Saturday that iowa had the
