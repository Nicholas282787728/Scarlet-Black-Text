A DOUBLE BLANK.

Neirher Grrnhcll nor Des Moines Scores
in Saturday's Gan-lei}! Fair
Airendance.

Des Moines College sent niteen loot-
ball men to Grinnell last Saturday to
see to how small a score they could
hold the Iowa College team. How
well they succeeded is told by the two
ciphersit takes to record the result.

A discouraging d it started early
in the alrernoon but in spite of the
dampness a lair crowd of rootcrs was
early on the scene and with the Iowa
College band to cheer them up kept
warm and hopeful throughout g lg
iortlr a good sample of Grinnell yell-
ing. The referee tooted his whistle at
2 30 and called the teams to tlleil‘lpoA
sitions in the ﬁeld. Des Moines had
won the toss-up and chose the north
goal, The ﬁrst kick on was well fol-
lowed up by Grinnell and only a short
run~baclr was allowed. Des Moines
won their ﬁrst down by linerbucking
but on their next try were pushed
back twice and forced to punt. Ve-
larius ran the punt back to the center
of the lield and then began the march
which almost meant a touchdown.
Steady gains or three to teir
yards through the line by the backs
advanced the ball steadily toward Des
Moines’ goal. Then with the ball on
her own Live yard line and with tirrce
downs ior Grinnell to make it in
Des Moines put up a line quality oi
defense which saved her life. They
took the ball, which was separated
from a touchdown by a heartbreaking
two ieet and started in to take it out
oi danger. A penalty ior holding
helped them to the extent of live
3 ids, and then began an un-
certain march up and down Des Moines
territory, Grinnell never getting close
enough to warrant a try for goal.
Pierce got ahaulrle twisted and was
forced to leave the game, Clack taking
his place. Each side was iorced to
punt time after time, the lrali ending-
with the ball in Grillllell’s possession
on Des Moines forty yard line.

In the second half )lch'eun‘s place
was taken by rluraclrer whose position
at end was lilled by )lcilratll. Des
Moines kicked oil and held Grinuell
iora punt, then taking the ball to
Griilnell's thirty yard line, the closest
it ever got. Their came more or the
back and forth business1 neither side
seeming able to endanger its oppon-
eilt’s goal, though oiten making twen-
ty or thirty yarr before losing Llle
ball. Finally Des Molnes weakened a
little and some extra hard work by
Grinnell worked the ball down to Des
Moines’tell yard line, a touchdown
seem'lng sure. Inst here holding by
Grinnell caused a iliteen yard penalty
which really lost her the game. That
tiresome exchanging oi the ball began
again without material result Ior any
body, until at last time was called

THE SCIENCE DEPARTMENTS.

Some interesting Fncts Concerning our
Laboratories which are nol Generally
Known by me Public.

In the slﬂtenlenls of the ncedsoi‘
Iowa College there has usually ap-
peared that or a science building. The
ideallas beelltlulb there should boil
birildingcapableoihouseing adequare-
ly and conveniently all the sciences.
The new building has not come, but
re-adyustments have been made, par-
ticularly in the past summer, and the
science work has Ilereloped until it is
safe to say that the original idea of II
science building may as well be given
up. The work has grown beyond the
capacity of ally one building that the
college would be at all likely to secure.
As the college grows the needs will be
for a building or buildings, each to
accommodate or're science or at most
two closely allied sciences.

In the recent shifting of depart
ments physics and mathematics have
gone to Goodnow Hall. Mathematics
occupies the lirst lloor. The old read-
ing room has been divided into two
recitation rooms, all oliice and a room
for drawing. Physics occupies thc re
mainder of the building. The second
iloor contains an oillce, shop room and
a large general laboratory, The open
space between the ﬁrst and second
Staci: stories llils been ilool'cd over,
giving the building It third std The
central portion of this is occupied by it
well appointed recitation room \HLh
raised iloorl On each side, north and
south, are Well lighted laboratory
rooms for advanced workers. The a -
rangernent is excellent, and in point
of space and convenience, and con-
sidering the number of Students,
physics is now probably theben‘t housed
department, whereas it was formerly
the Worst

1n Blair Hall, botany occupies the
space vacated by physics, bilt labora-
tory space has been enlarged by IDs
moving partitions, giving a general
laboratory room the [oil length oi the
building. The former shop room has
been converted into a bacteriological
laboratory. The whole arrangement
is convenient, and the rooms are well
lighted and dctrdcl ire.

By the siriiting oi botany, zoology
gains the large laboratory room on the
third floor, which nearly doubles the
laboratory space oflhis- department.

Though the arrangement oi tlic

on the presentstate oi the work, and
the space allotted to it. Fifteen years
ago chemistry had the only laboratory

equipped. At present there are four

wellequipped laboratories capable of
accommodating more than two llunr
dred students working at the same
time, and the plants may be con. dered
adequate for the science work demand-

THE OCTOBER REGISTRATION.

The Compilation ar Ihls Time Shows a

Remarkable Increase m Comparison
wiih Former Years.

We publish toda) the complete reg»

istratiorr as given out each year on the
ﬁrst of October.

The ligurcs inrliche
wonderful growth ill the College of

Liberal A Its and Show many lULBl‘eSt‘
ing comparisons. The Senior and Soph-
omore classes have

about the usual
umber but the Junior and Freshman

classes show surprising increases. The
one hundred and Sistyrnine Freshmen
is a remarkable number Ioi Iowa col-
lege, although a class wilh sixty Jiiu-
iors is no less astounding. Thc SOpllDr
mores deserve special mention chieily
because the men out-number the Wom-
en, while in the Senior Class the ratio
is almost three to one in favor of the
[air sex. The Freshman class shows a
considerable increase in the number of
men in comparison with other years.
All things considered, the friends of
Iowa College have every reason to be
pleased with the prospects which are
before us.
