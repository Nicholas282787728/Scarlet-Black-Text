PREDICTIONS REAle ED.

Threstening Aimnpheric Conditions
Mnterinhze and the xpee Cyclone
StrikesiThe Havoc Wrought.

Yesterday dawned gloomy ztnti told,
and the oldest inhabitants, alter coin-
paring the direction oi their whiskers
with the direction or the smoke, pre»
dicted a rainy day and trusts, but the
scientlsrs at the head of the Junior
Weather Department knew better.
They, accordingly issued bulletins,
warning the public of the approach
oi a twister oi huge proportion which
should reach the college campus about
4:15. All day the excitement ran high
and the college was crowded with
fugitives.

In order to discredit the oldest in-
habitants, nature did her best to look
pleasant and, as so orten happens, the
Cyclone came from aclear sk .

A booth covered with blue and white
hunting had been erected on the south
campus, guarded by junior girls in
white duck suits and blue ties, and
the college band near by prepared to
drown out the cry oi the wounded.
At the hoot of an automobile horn
was heard and four touring cars bear-
ing the Annual Board of 1906 dashed
down the campus from the north,
while the sun shown and the band
played and the junior yell resounded
over all. Then began the mndrush
of the crowd for the books and the re-
treat to some shady corner to laugh
at the jokes on tlle other fellow and
to become indignant at the jokes that
strike nearer home.

The annual board oilcod have proven
themselves capable oi periorming in
a very creditable manner. a task, that
is yearly becoming , m u re ditl-icult.
They are m be congratulated on the
book they‘ have produced and the class
is to be congratulated on the board it
elected.

The 1006 Cyclone iS bound in brown
cloth with gilt decorations, producing
a very pleasing appearance. Besides
an exceptionally large number of ex-
cellent cartoons or students and l'acul-
ty and the usual hits at college hap-
penings, the Cyclone contains an ap-
preciation oi I‘rof. S. J. Buck and
several contributions by membersof
the alumni, New and beautiful
pictures or the campus furnished with
a brown tint and mounted on heavy
brown paper are scattered through
the book and will make it especially
desirable to the alumni.

Indvidually and collectively the 1906
board are deserving or the highest
praise tor the work they have accom-
plished. The board dined utthc Mon-
roe iast evening and werelnter tender-
ed a banquet at the Met by theirclass.

There will be i]. \‘iolin recital by pu-
pils of Miss Rew on Saturday after-
noon, June 3, at three Women The
minuet and iinale from a Haydn Toy
Symphony will be played by a juvenile
orchestra of ﬁfteen members.

MR. MATLACK'S RECITAL.

Former D rector of Grinnell Conserva»
toly Enlertains Course Patrons with
Organ Selections.

Yesterday evening in th e College
Chapel Mr. Henry w. Matlack gave
the twentieth and last recital in the
School oi Music Recital Course. Mr.
Matlack was Director or the School or
Music 1901—1903, and did much to shape
the musical policy or the institution.
In lact it may he said that the work
of the School at Music at present is
but the deﬁnite carrying out or Mr.

Matlack’s ideals. .

The program at last evening was a
characteristic oneilih e in b e r g e r,
Bach, Elgar and Winn. The Rhein-
berger A minor Sonata is not his best,
the Fuga cromatica showing the most
inspiration of the three movements.
It is written however throughout in
Rheinberger’s b r o a d eontrapuntal
style and with characteristic sweep
and mastery. In Each Mr. Matlack is
thoroughly at home, and the Bach,
numbers were thoroughly enjoyed.

The Saint d‘Amoul' by Elgar is very
skillful and was played with great del-
icacy and ﬁnish. The March requires
a larger organ and a larger auditor-

‘inm, but did not fail or its inspiration

even with out these advantages.
Both movements or the Wider Symr
phony are exquisite, the Allegro with

 

its varied dynamics and line rhythm
appealing to the audience.

It is a great pleasure to Grinnell to
see and hear Mr. Matlaclr again, and
We trust that this will be but tllei’irst

XOWA WiNs STATE MEET.

Grinnell takes 33; points and Second

pnrntmenv.

Iowa. College was well represented
at Des Moines last Saturday, both on
the track and in the grand stand, No
less than four hundred students and
citizens of Grinnell were present at
the last and best State meet ever held
at the fair grounds and the team that
wore the scarlet and black was the
strongest aggregation that has con:-
peted for Iowa College since 1901. The
day was won by the State University,
Grinnell taking second honols, with
Drake child and Normal fourth. The
men ironi Atnes, who had been picked
as winners oi the meet, were some-
thing of a disappointmentm their ad-
hel'ents, they being unable to land

more than 17 points and ﬁfth rank.

As had beell anticipated Grinnell’s
strength was in tile dashes, the hur-
dles and the weights In the relays
excellent form was shown by every
knight 0 f the Maltese Cross b o t h

heavy track, one that was fully a, see

covered in 1:32 4-5, or one ﬁfth oi a.
second slower than the record. Mc-
Kean’s handling ol the weights was re-
rnarkahle and consistent. The heavy
boy [roln Grinnell won both discus and
shot put, taking the state record in
theldtter event at 40 lb. ﬁve. Mis~
fortune however befall him in the
hammer ior he barely broke ground
outside of the circle at two diﬂerent
times after throws that were long
enough to win the ﬁrst by several feet.
Kisser had the some bad luck with a.
throw that should have landed him
a plane ill the ﬁnals. Neither Grinneli
man qualiﬁed,

It can scarcely be said that any one
