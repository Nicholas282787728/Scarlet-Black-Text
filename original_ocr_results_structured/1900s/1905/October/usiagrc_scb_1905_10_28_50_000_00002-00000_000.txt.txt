HE announcement in the Unit of
it prize song colllest has hl'OiIght
up the old question again, ”Why don't
Grinnell students sing?” A few Ol‘
the pessimisls might answer that we
have nothing to sing (or, hilt ScAl:LET
AXD BLACK believes that the trouble
is [I
This lack hits already been pointed
out in the Unit and one of the objects
of the contest is to remedy this (lil-
ﬁculty. Surely we have plenty oi
singers, or lilloost alhrge numher who
pl'oless in be able to Cltrry a time.
Another reason which we believe
has served to quiet our sougsiem is
that any attempt on the part or stu-
Lleuts to show their enthusiasm has
been frowned upon by Lila college
authorities. By tlint statement we do
not. wish to give the impression [hilt
singing has been prohibited by 2)
faculty rule but that any display of
enthusiasm except on speolal occasions
has not been encouraged as at other
schools. At the University DI Min-
nesota the college song is sung at
evely Friday morning chapel and one
of the ﬁrst things which is required of
the freshman is that he learn the col-
‘lege song and be prepared to sing it
when called upon. We believe in
that Sort of thing although We realr
ize that it would he the height of fully
to suggest such nthing to {my Grinnell
proiessor. However, we are permitted
to sing America now and then and
why not a college song. The one isan
expression of our loyalty lor our
Country; the other would be an ex-
pression of our loyalty (or our college‘
:0: course, (J, third rensou is that stu-
dents do not come together us o oody
except at chapel or at a mass meeting
called with some delillite aim in View,
and consequently we have no singing.
Perhaps, singing is not a necessary
part of Undergraduate life but [01’ our
part We should like to have the 0p-
pol’lmlity of hearing the Gl'inrlell Stllv
(lent: sing just one good old college
song before we take our 62 tune for
other lands. The nlullllli song is all
right in ils placo hut it is only ““8th
ed [01' Ll‘ltlllell voices and even than,
it becsmes somewhat tiresome at
timbs. No, what “0 want is a. Com»
position which e\ ‘esses the true
spirit of the inslltllliou and which
can be sung at each and ovary Occasion
when it is needed. Tile composer “ho
will give to us a good mllicing College
Song flesei‘vesd place in the Hull OI
Fume, eien though he doesn't get it.
At any rate we wil' see (0 it that he
or she, as the case may he, gets a vote

of thanks ill addition to the live pieces
of silver. This surely ought to be sufr
ﬁcient inducement ior every hard to
get busy.

The Unit Board will meet Monday
at 4:15 p. u, in Professor Stoup's room
at the library.

The SCARLET AND BLACK staff will
meet Tuesday evening at 5:30, in the
