MARTIN ]. BERGEN ARRiVEs,

Grinneir's Famous Coach Takes Charge
or the Team—A General Shake-up
Probableitoe Game Saturday.

There is joy in the Grlnuell camp
in Martin J. Bergenoi Princeton, or
“Mike” Ashe \Vasitir'eutlonittely known
in iormer years when lie was the idol
of the Grinnell squad arrived Monday
anddt Once assumed control of the
team. Coach Bergen is the Same Old
Mike or ten years ago and the years
evidently have made no impression on
him. He is rust as quick and spright-
1y as ever and has lost none of his old
time enthusiasm ior the game.

He was very iavorably impressed
with the material at hand, although
he refused to make any statements as
to the prospects.

The coming or Ber-gen :could hardly
be more opportune and his presence
has inspired a new feeling or con-
ﬁdence among Grihnen rcoters. It is
no secret that the poor showing of the
team in the last two games has been a.
cause for disappointment and there
has been a feeling prevalent that the
record of last yea): would be repeated.
The team has not gotten into the
game in the way that was expected of
them in the early part of the season.
0! course the warm Weather has had
some reﬂect and the men have not dis-
played the ginger that they will when
it becomes cooler. The players have
not showed any tendency to loaf, but
they simply have failed to work Lu—
getncr and to use team work necessary
for good football. The season has
barely begun and [here is still time
for improvement but what Grinucll
wants and what we have the right to
expect is hard, consistent Work by
every min) who has donned a uniform.

Coach Bergen ha. brought with him
a number or new plays andan entirely

play. A general shilkll‘grup iii the

the scrimmage work has bcen cs

good share or his tinze to coaching the

there has been adecidcd improvement
along that line already.
