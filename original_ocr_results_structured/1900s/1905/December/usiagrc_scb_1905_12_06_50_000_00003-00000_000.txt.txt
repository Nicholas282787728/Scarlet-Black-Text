FOOTBALL AT GRINNELL.

A Summary efrhe Facts and Ever-us in
fire Annals of this Span at
Iowa College.

(l‘y .i, \v Mcmnur.)

The page in the history of our col-
lege which tells the tales of the grid-
iron is one which deserves not only
interest but pride. We are fortunate
in having bright prospects for the
future. We have no reason to con-
sider the present as worthy of any-
thing but honorable mention, but we
are in a still more pleasant position
when We consider that we do not need
to fight to redeem our past; that has
taken care of itself Wonderfully well.

Football was organized at about the
same time at Iowa City and Grinnell
and the state contests Of the ﬁrst
three years were conﬁned to these two
schools. Each year was a Victory for
Grinneli, for the University went
down before the Scarlet and Black in
’89, ’90 and ’91. Victory was temper-
ed by defeat, however, in the two
years last mentioned, for the Univers-
ity of Minnesota succeeded in doing
what. in three years no other team in
the state could do. From that time
on football became a better known
game in the west. The Grinnell sched»
ule gradually enlarges from one of
three games a year to its present size
of nine and ten games. Ames was the
next school in the State to demand
close attention, playing heriirst games
With Iowa College in 1893 and suffer-
ing two defeats, one of 36 to G and one
0138 to 12. In 18% She won her ﬁrst
victory by a score of ~10 to 0. This Was
also her last victory until 1902. Out-
side schools continually demanded at-
tention, half the schedule often being
composed of games outside the state.
Nebraska and Wisconsin were able to
score victories over Grinnell in the
majority cfthe games they played her.
We were more successful however in
the games within the state, for up to
1898, Iowa and Alnes were the only
schools needing serious consideration.
After that Drake entered the lists and
demanded her share of victories.
Lesser schools have never threatened
Grinnell's place in the “Big Four,”
unless it was in the disastemlls season
of 1904. Of the “Big Four” games
Grinnell has Won sixteen out of thirty-
eight, though often by narrow margins
while the scores in her defeats have
run high. A summary of the scores in
all her games show that she has come
out. very nearly even, both she and her
opponents having in the neighborhood
of 10 5 points to their respective
credits.

A glance at the whole football period
in the college brings to notice two in-
teresting facts. The scores have grad-
ually diminished 0n the losers’ side.
In few games now- -daysdoes the loser-
get more than one touchdown, scores
like “-10 to ‘24” and 22714” being very
scarce. Defense has had a greater de-
velopment than offense, evidently, for
the number of “shutouts” gradually
increases. The days whehapoor team

the failure of her teams to increase iii
weight in the same proportion as those
of her opponents have done, has been
to her decided disadvantage. Other
schools have increased in size and her
teams have accordingly become heave

Iowa College in the early nineties were
as heavy as those which (50 battle [or
her today. Perhaps this explains in
part why her privilege has been taken
away from her.

Grinnell has had comparatively few
professional coaches. Tile ﬁrst one of
any kind was in 1893. He was followed
the nextyear by Martin Bergen, Whom
we all know and respect. With three
other exceptions Grinnell’s coaching
has all been done by graduates who
have come back for love of their Alma
Mater. Dr. C. E, Harris deserves
credit for much of this work, for Since
1896 he has been a regular attendant
and helper at all the football practices
in Iowa College.

It is impossible to give here details
ed statemenls as to all the games and
scores in which Grinnell has had a
part. We are not ashamed of them,
and prove it when We say that in all
her history. Iowa. College has won (5-!
games and lost 46. A half dozen have
been ties. This surely should speak
for itself. But if football has done
nothing else for this scllooliii every
game had been lost, there is still one
thing which justiﬁes the whole. Early
in her football career there was some
thing which appeared in the college
and has been there ever since. It has

spread into other branches of athletics .

but it came with foot ball and still
stays Withit. Let us hope that. the

Grinnell spirit will ever he with us.

“MIKE” BERGEN WRITES:

To view the season of 1905 at Grin-
mail as successful or unsuccessful one
must depend on the point of view of
the observer. The team (lid not win
the championship, nor could it have
been expected to do so by the must ope
timistic- A man does not become .1
football player in a month and no one
could expect or hope that the team
could cope with the heavier veterans
of Iowa City, Ames and Drake when
the season was but that old. In
judging this year’s results, it must.
not be forgotten that. we presented
but few veterans in our line, and our
greenlless must bring us forgiveness
for some scores made against us.

There is another way to view this
season‘s work, which must give great
pride to Grinncll men. Whatever the
social status of its players may be,
football requires of them their best,
which necessitates denial of much of
the ﬁligree of life, self control, perfect
good faith, entire elimination of
pain and disregard for 0112’s desires,
and demands this for a space of over
two long months. All these things
the Griiinell team showed in the high»
est degree this year.

The members of the team were men
of the best type, they trained honesc
ly and conscientiously, and slinwed
the spirit and determination which

 

makes victors in all ﬁelds of life.

Each of them tried his hardest and
the atmosphere of the ﬁeld was that

_of a set of gentlemen doing their best
to succeed in that which theyliad un-

dertaken for their college. Their
thoughts were entirely impersonal,
their work was for the success of the
college in that in which they had
been delegated to bear forward its
name. The entity, GrinnellCollcge,
shonlrl be proud of its 1905 team. It
was a pleasure to coach and to be as-
sociated with them,

The recent agitation against foot
ball cannot help but make us college
men who are believers in our game.
question whether the game is worth
while, and if it is, what our-stand is
in reference to it. To my mind there
is no question about the game. Fool.-
ball isa manhood’ssport: it requires
men to play it, and it cultivates the
spark of manhood which everyone
possesses until that spark becomes a
name illuminating the whole charac
ter. It has trained up, and is train
ing up today. in every village and
hamlet. vvhereacollege or school ex-
ists, a race of men that is the equal oi
the spartan manhood. I cannot but
think that Stephen Crane's descrip-
tion in his “Red Badge of Courage,"
of the long line of slightly wounded
who were winding from the battle
front, could not be written or the
present day manhood of our country.
It was so shown by those football men
who were present at Santiago. His-
tory has always recorded that the
best soldiers are gentlemen, and any
man who has passed through a collar
giate football season can be none
other after such a training. The
manhood as taught by football reach
as to all spheres of activity. It is
simply doing one’s best, irrespective
of difficulties and obstructions. A
game cannot be allowed to perish
which aims at and accomplishes such
results. Granting its qualities, all
college men must stand to their coir
ors. They must treat the game with
seriousness; never lightly. It does
not need defense. but needsa wider
knowledge of its qualities among its
defamei-s, and more seriousness and
honest outspoken advocacy by its
friends,wlth more truthfulness and
less baseless criticism by men ignor-
ant cf it. _

Football as it is played to-rlay by a
college team, must be regarded by the
men of a team, to make it a winning
one, as asci-lous task. It is the most
public contest in which the colors of
that college are brought into competilr
tion and placed side by side with the
colors of another college. The men in
this contest do not meet each other as
individual against individual, butas
college against college. A college
entity consists not alone of the stu-
dents but, in addition, the Alumni
and friends of that institution, who
outnumber the students perhaps lif-
tecn to one. A man‘s college is his
college as long as he lives, and to the
alumnus the undergraduate body is

merely the temporary keeper of his

household idols, the present of his

 

past youth,

v
bearing his own banner
. a. ,

 

and haunting his own colors. This
student body is, therefore. responsible
to this host of alumni for the proper
keeping and preservation ofthc college
ideals. That is the task of the under-
graduates and each has his part; and
the men of the football team are
merely those who are delegated to
beara more prominent part in this
most advertised presentation of those
ideals before the public. But the
alumni of Grinnell must not forget
that they have recripiocal duties in
return for this tremendous burden
which college spirit has placed on the
undergraduates If they do not do
theirshare, that burden may become
tooheavy for the undergraduates to
bear.

Tile alumni must help them ill
every Way. They lnllst See that
proper supervision is given. They
must show active interest. And they
must above all give the most practical
assistance by seeing that the boys of
their respective communities go to
Grinncll, which result, a little persons
al attention will very frequently bring
about. Each alumnus has his part

He has had one year football experi»
ence with the State Center High

Wilford O. Bleamaster, '08, has,
somehow, won from his friends the
sobriquet of “Jimmie” but we prefer
calling him ”Sunny Jim” for that
title seems to typify remarkably well
one of his many valuable assets which
unite to make the all around football
man. “Jimmie's” optimism always
appears uppermost and more than
once this fall has it won the respect or
the observer. We are glad to say that
Mr. Bicamaster is elected Captain of
the team for the coming year. His
work this year at left half has been
sufﬁciently good to give him a place
on the all Iowa team. Bleamaster
weighs 152 pounds, stands 5 it. 9 in. in
height and is 22 years old. He was
captain of the Lyons High School
football team two years before coming
to Grinnell. He has played here two
seasons on the varsity and one as sub
athalfback. Lives at Lyons, Iowa.
