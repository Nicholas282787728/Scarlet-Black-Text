THE GAMES ARE ON.
[Continued lmm hrsi nuns]

The second day of the basketball
games brought two surprises. the poor
showing oi the Senior team, and the
defeat of tile Sophomores by the Acae
demy. Both gnmes were very rough. as
have been all the games thus far. The
games nre so rough that there can be
no team Work. and thus there is no
interestin the game lor the spectn»
tors. A person'does not go up to the
gymnasium to see a football game.

SOPIIOFIUILErACADEln'.

The ﬁrst game was between the
Sophomores and Academy which DhE
Academy won hyn score of30to 23.
The Sophomores at the end of tile
first half seemed to have the game
well in hand. but the Academy came
back strong in the second half and by
hard consistent work overcame the
lend oi the Sophomores nnrl won by a,
mnrgin or seven points. The Sopho-
more team went to pieces aitcrtlie
Academy tied the score and could do
