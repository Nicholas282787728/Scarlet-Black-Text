A DECIDED SUCCESS.

The Juniors Entertain the Freshman in
a Royal Manner st ihe liner.
class Party.

The Rand Gymnasium has been the
scene of many sooililevents but no class
has ever l‘eccivcdamore royal welcome
\yiLhin those walls than the class of
190-. did on last Satiirduy evening.
The lnter~olass parties are always the
chief Social events 01' the year and for
that reason much rivalry exists as to
“ho shrill carry oi! ﬁlst honors as
hosts. Since Saturday owning the
general opinion is that the palm
of victory belongs to the Juniors and
that they have Set a Standard which
has never before been equaled and
which will he diillcult to maintain.

The decorationstliough simple, were
ell‘ectire and the whole interior of the
building was one of beauty. The
scarlet and black colors were me,
dominant and were used to the very
best advantage. A very pleasing cilect
in the decorations was the arrange—
ment of the college colors in the back-
ground for the platiorm. The dim
limits, together with the palms. gave
the whole an oriental charm. A novel
feature was the use made or two lawn
swings, which proved to be very
popular throughout the evening.
These were tastefully decorated in
the class colors of the respective
classes.

The new feature iortheclass parties
was the introduction Of outside talent
for entertainment. Mr. Sidney Lan-
don,opi~ofossional i-eadcraiid imper-
senator. connected with the Midland
Lyceum Bureau of Des Moiiles,iui‘nlsh-
ed the entertainment of the evening.
Mr. Landon came direct from Clayton,
Illinois, where he closed a successful
four molltlls’ tour as an entertainer.

His work was of high order and he
showed himself to be an artist of the
ﬁrst rank. His impersonations were
exceedingly good and he kept his
audience interested during the whole
time. His presentation of Riley’s
poem, “\Vhen the Train Cumesin,”
and Kipling‘s “DunkrarDee” Were es-
peoially good and captivated his audi—
ence. 1115 “makeup” as a homesick
Swedo was :true to life, and and as a
German orator, he would have passed
for a native of the fatherland. IIis
program in irs entirety was that of an
artist and was the some as given in
the regular lecture courses.

Immediately following the enter-
tainmellt, refreshments were served.
alter which the grand promenade
was enroycd by all before departing.

The chaperoiis were Professor and

Mrs. Heidel, Miss Pattie, Miss Fisher,
Mrs. Bradley, Mr. Frampton, and Mr.
Ryan. ,

Thecommitteein charge were Laura
Withington, Edna Sears, Louise Miles,
Walter Williams, Robert McCandlass
and Arie Muyskens.

DEAN SANDERS LEAVES YALE.

Has Resigned From the Divinity
School in Accept a Posi-
tion in Boston.

Iowa College people will be surprised
to hear of the resignation 0! Dean
Flank Sanders from (he Yale
Divinit School to accept the pus ion
oi Secretary for the Congregational
Sunday School and Publishing Society
of Boston. Dr. Sanders will retain
his present position until the opening
of the next school year in October.

It will be remembered that in 15101
when the ollice of president was ten-
dered to Dr. Sanders by the Iowa Col-
lege trustees, that one of the reasons
for his refusal was his election atlthe
same time to the allied of Dean and
Professor of Biblical History and
Archaeology in the Divinity School,
an oilico which was specially created
for him. It now developes that the
olllce was a provisional one and than it
was hoped that a founrlaciou fund
would be Secured to Support the ofﬁce.
The failure to do this has brought
about the above results and Dr. San-
ders will leave Yale.

Dr. Sanders has performed agreat
work during the Limo that he has been
connected with the institution and his
elicits have reaped good results. His
absence will be sorely felt and his
work will receive a serious reversal,
especially since he leaves because of
ﬁnancial reasons.

one, in criticising the American Board
of Foreign Missions in accepting the
Dr. Bradley said:
“Whatever may be righc or wrong the

gift of Rockefeller.

American Board is the trustees of
these educational institutions that
would be assisted by Mr. Reelielellel’s
gift of $100,000. Whatever the board
may think of Mr. Rockefeller, per-
sooolly, or how he made his money,
it must keep in mind the condition of
these people that the money will bene-

ﬁt, and how badly they need it."—

THE TRAINING SEASON.

IAilileies atall rho Colleges are Working
. Hay-(lAA Few Side Lights
on Spring Mccxs.

“The green is on the glass again”
alldonce more the sprinter does his
daily stunt Oil the cinder track or
oounis the tics for a mile or two in or-
der to get into good form for the
spring meets. This is the period for
hard work and now is the time when
both trainer and athlete say nothing
but keep busy. Later on the famous
alumni of the various institutions Will
have their little pipe dreams and then
the newspapers will be ﬁlled with con-
tradictory reports as to the hopes and
ambitions of the various teams.

At present. prospects are bright
everywhere and no hard luck stories
have appeared. Ame: with cwchun-
dred and lilty men training and with
Jack Watson as trainer expect toshow
the other fellows a few things this
year. however they have put [orth
no claims and are only-smiling to them-
selves when the wily Jack tells
them what he Will do. At Drake, the
prospects are just as bright as ever
and already Dr. )Ionilaw's squad has
begun to break records indoors. The
absence of Chester Main is sorely felt
but nevertheless Drake will be repre-
sented by astrong aggregation when
the time comes.

Iowa is jubilant over the aqusitlou
or her two trainers, Rule and Delaney,
who promise to revolutionize the nth
Isles of the old gold. A large squad is
in training and several pi-oinising men
have shown up.

At State Normal, Doctor Fall is
working hard to produce a team which
will surpass the record of last year’s
team and according to reports, he may
surprise the big four at the State meet.

1n base ball, the air is iull of rumors
and everything is rather uncertain.
Iowa reportsa goodly number 01 prom-
ising candidates and expects to pro-
duce a Winning team. At Amos a
large squad is out, but it is not. known
whether Brown will be permitted to
play or not, so that the success or fail-
one or the team depends largely on the
one mall.

Cornell has secured a ﬁrst class
coach and is determined to auto ﬁgure
this season on the diamond.

Gl’lnnell is probably in the poorest
condition diary of the teams, since
She will be handicapped by the lack of
strong pitchers. The team will have
very few veteran players and it will
require hard. consistent work to pro
duce a successful aggregation.

EXPERlENcES AND IMPRESSIONS

As Told by n Rhodes Scholar in the
Educarional Review——A Brief
Resume.

The Educational Review for March
contains an interesting article by IV.
E. Sclllllt, an A lnerican student
at nrrsenpi-e College, Oxford. Mr.
Scllutt tells some of the principal
things Which have impressed him dur-
ing his three month's sojourn at the

alma mater of Cecil Rhodes.

One of the things which ilnpl'esm’l
him most was that on their ‘ -ill,
they were nssigned Lo rooms in the
dormitories, and that in case the quar-
ters wove nor. large onough,tho Seniors
gave up their rooms to the Freshman
and sought quarters elsewhere. This
is exactly opposite to the custom in
America where the poor Freshman is
compelled to seek other rooms when
the fraternity rooms are too Small.

In most colleges, chapel attendance
is compulsory and failure to attend
will result in the refusal to grant you
your degree on graduation, consequent-
ly chapel cutting is an unknown prac-
tice at Oxford.

The Social life is very impultant and,
is a special feature. Each student
dines in his own room, but. he .iS ex-
pected to entertain his fellowstudents
so many times each year and in return
invited to enjoy their hospitality.

Athletics are a very essential part
or their college training and are em-
phasized even more than in America.
After lunch the colleges are deserted
and nearly everyone goes out to the
athletic ﬁelds Dr to the river to low.
In athletics, llr. Schlltt says tlint the
American students have not lived up
to their reputation and that their
athletic deeds are not much higher
than those of the average Oxford
freshman.

One of the unpleasant features is
the strict rules and customs which are
in marked contrast to the freedom of
the American Universities. Students
out after nine in the evening are ﬁned
and if out after twelve are subject to
expulsion. Gowna must be worn in
the presence of tutors at dinners, lec-
Lures etc. i

Life at Oxford is very expensive and
many are compelled to economize in
order to make his ﬁfteen hundred lost
him through the year. One Scholar
said, "We pay every time we turn
around and when we don't turn around
We are Lined for not having done it.”

However American students are
rapidly accommodating themselves to
the existing conditions and are be-
coming an important factor in the
University life.
