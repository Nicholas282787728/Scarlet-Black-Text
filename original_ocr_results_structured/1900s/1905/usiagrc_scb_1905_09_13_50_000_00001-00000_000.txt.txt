The question uppermost in every
ones’ mind at present: is “What are
Grinnell’s prospects this year?” The
disastrous season of last year is re-
membered with aslluddel‘ and better
things are hoped for. Many 01 the old
men will return and with the large
number of new men registered, it is to
be expected thatarairly good team
can be produced. Atany rate, We will
have a, team which will represent the
college iuacredltable manner. The
players will report for practice the
latter part of this week.

As to couches and trainers, Iowa Colv
loge could hardly have selected it more
Competent set of men. Tully Fiske,
\VllO will be remembered as the fast
quarterback 0f the 19 .. team and ll
plu-cr who has had no superior in

of the team lor the greater part of the l

season. He will be assisted in thc‘

the following to say of Bergen: ”Sclellr

modern sense may be said to have bar

Mr. Bergen, or “Mike" as he was
known among the boys, had played
with Princeton in 1392 and acted as
coach in 1893. But besides bcinga
good player. llc understood football.

the [bum States and no man in thcl

this 'Lime the “Princeton system” was
adopmd, which with some “Gl'innell”
modiﬁcations, remains in use at the
present time. The next season lound
“Mike" Bergen back with the team
once more and under his master hand
was developed what was probably the
best team lowa College ever sent out
to do battle for the alma mater."
Trainer Fisher will again look alter
the physical conditions of the team,
and we can be assured of a strong set
ol players. Tile Milwaukee high
