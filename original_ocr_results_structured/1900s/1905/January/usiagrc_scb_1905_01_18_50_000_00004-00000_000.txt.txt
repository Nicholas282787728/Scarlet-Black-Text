Widor Andante was beautifully ghen.

The Science Gallon was exceedingly
interesting composition, and its bril»
lionoy contrasted well Wth the re-
strained melody oithe preceding num-
ber. Very interesting lrom several
standpoints was the last number of
the program. Mr. Andrews or Ober-
linis one of the commanding ﬁgures
in the musical liistory.and musical
education or the middle west, and it
was good to have a composition iroin
the pen oia musician wlicm we can
claim as our own which measures up
so well with all that is excellent
in organ music.

. The tact that Mr. Erampton is a pupil
‘or Mr. Andrews and that the sonata
was dedicated to him gives it on addi-
tional interest to Grinnell people.
The worlr is very musicianly and en

ceedingly beautiful in both move-
ments played. it is hoped that some-

time the entire composition may ap-
pear on a recital programme.
