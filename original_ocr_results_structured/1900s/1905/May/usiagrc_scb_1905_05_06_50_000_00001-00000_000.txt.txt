AMES 5, GRINNELL 2.

The Scarlet and Black Loses a Hard
Fought Contest.7Sl—nithson
Fans Twelve.

Andes and Grinnell crossed bats yes»
terda)‘ on the Ames ﬁeld in the lirst
hard college game oitlre season for
either team. The scarlet and black
met defeat at the llallds Of the Farm-
ers as had been generally expected but
a lierce light was put up throughout.

The grounds were in line condition
and with crowded bleachers on both
sides, everything with the one excep-
tion of threatening rain was favorable
for an exciting contest. The Grinnell
aggregation appeared on the diamond
ﬁrst and soon made it, evident
through their preliminary work that
they were not new to the game. A
feeling of conﬁdence seemed to prevall
among the routers irorn the beginning
which was only moderated by the
whirlwind start. or the Congregational-
ists. Gl'innell was ﬁrst at bat and
succeeded in tallying run number one.
The brill was Well hammered and
everything pointed towards an ilscell-
sion. Riley (lid not receive the proper
supnort from his team mates during
the early part of game and things
looked bad for him. Smithson pitched
for Grinnell and made a record for
himself. Although a trifle nervous at
times he succeeded in pitching out of
all tight places. The record or allow
ing only Live hits and with twelve
strikeouts to his credit against a ham
hitting team would do Justice to the
best. 0] then). The Grinnell bulloh
did excellent ﬁelding throughout and
much can be expected from them in
the future.

Allies, in good iorm, demonstrated
that she will make a strong race ior
lirsr place in the state.

The Grilmell team stayed in Des
Moilles last night and left for Indian-

ola this morning where they will en-
deavor to take the Methodists into
camp. It is likely that, Smithson
will work again todayas yesterday’s
performance had little or no ellect

YESTERDAY’S CHAPEL TALK.

Taking his theme from the texts of
three cirapel talks recently given from
the same platform Professor “305’ yes-
terday morning delivered a convinc-
ing plea for the cause of education
along‘rines relating to live subjects.
A higher level ol’scholarslrip in gener-
al for Iowa college students had alv
ready been urged on at previous ooCar
sion; a warning against the danger of
letting education lead one away from
the real life had been held up only
a week beiore and not long ago a
faculty member had outlined the ad-
vantages and opportunities of politi-
cal careers. It was Professor Macy‘s
aim to emphasizerlre ideas previously
presented and to point our the need or
persistence and industry it one chooses
to follow political or economic ca-
reers, Thelives of President Roose-
velt and Mr. Gladstone furnished the
illustrations bearing on the point at
issue and their examples, so far as the
strenuousnessshowuin them is con
corned, was commended to zlll whose

LECTURE COURSE NEXT YEAR.

Attractions ror reps-do wul be Best Ever
Produced Here—Adolph Hahn
Appears Firsz.

There are many reasons wiry the
students of Iona College should look
[Olll'ald to next year with a great deal
oipleasure, but none is more potent
than the, iact that there will be
brought to Grinnell the strongest leC»
tore course ever presented in the
history orthc college or town. Un-
like many all star companies in which ,
each euviously strives to outdo his fel-
low. each number on this course is de~
signed to cover a deﬁnite ﬁeld, so that
in the whole area covered there will
be something to attract and interest
every person, no matter how small the
space upon which his attention is, can»
tered. A glance at the personal of
the course will show a remarkable com-
bination of talent, suolras iew towns
of the size are privileged to enjoy.
The Y. M. c. A. committee in charge
oiler the iollowing attractions: The
Hahn Festival Orclrestraof Cincinnati,
llon..lohn Barrett, Mrs. Maude Bal-
liugton Booth, Mr. Jack London, Opie
Read and Mr,llervey Smith McGowan.

The Orchestra, secured as a special
treat to the patrons or the course, is
one oitlre very best in the country,
It is composed of thirty members of
marred ability. each one a trained
artist and is under the leadership or a
man who is daily growing in iavor in
the musical world. Mr. Hahrr,ns well
as a large number of his men, has had
wide experience in his work and has
won much renown. lie was a rnuoh
admired member or the Van der-
Stricken Orchestra also or Cincinnati,
and many oilris men, iii taco nearly
all. have been or arestill members of
that organization. No one who has
heard either orchestra has anything
but words or highest commendation
ior them, so it is not too much to say
that ball the price or a course ticket
would be wellspeno to hear this one
musical number. It will open the
course here and will set a high stand-
ard [or the rest of Line season, so the
committee has l’elr obliged to keep up
to that mark of excellence by procur-
ing speakers who are as popular and
successiul in their lines as Adolph
Hahn and his orchestra,

Tire committee feels that rnlaok
London it has a man who will sustain
the reputation oi the course very cred-
ltilbly. Anyone who has kept abreast
oftlle tilllesin the line or literature
wrll not need to be told why he is suo
cessiul. llc has Written two oi the
