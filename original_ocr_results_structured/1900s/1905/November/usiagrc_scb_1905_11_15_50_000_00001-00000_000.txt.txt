THE BENEFIT CONCERT.

Lnsr Evcning‘s Entertainmznl sir rhe
Colonial is Enjoyed by a Goodly
Number oi Students and Towns-
people.

The entertainment given last even-
ing at the Colonial by local talent OI
town and college. for the beneﬁt oi the
Uncle Sam Club. was a success in eve
every way. The theatre was not
crowded although the attendance was
all that could be expected, and the
Club secured a Snug Sum of the coin oi
the realm to use in settlement Work.

The program was varied and pleas-
ing throughout. Each periorrner was
greeted with an encore and the audi-
ence was especially sympathetic. The
solos by Italph Lyman, ’07, and the
Quartette music were exceedingly
good. The club swinging by Raymond
Cary, ’06, would have done justice to a
professional, While the Negro MDHOA
iogne by Win. Cochran, ’07, was way
above par, The jokes by “Mike and
Ike” were somewhat antiquated, but
their singing more man made up [or
that defect. The Colonial Minuet
was not executed as well as it has been
before and the participants seemed to
be somewhat stage-struck. The solos
by Miss Fisher and Mr. Brande were
of the high class order Which is char-
acteristic of both artists.
