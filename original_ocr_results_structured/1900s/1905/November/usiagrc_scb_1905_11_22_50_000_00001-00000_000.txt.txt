THE SAME OLD STORY. 3

The Wearers ol the Scarlel and Black
Once Again Deleat ihe Royal Purple,
Score 5 to o.

In a game characterized by your
playing on the part of Grinnei] and by
a Stubborn defense on the part of Cor-
nell. the Methodists were Once more
compelled to submit to the inevitable
and to acknowledge that the time had
not yet come when the Royal Purple
should wave triumphantly over the
Scarlet and Black. Although the
Cornellians had no license to expect
victory, they went into the can-
test with (t vim and a spirit which at
times seemed almost irresistible. They
played desperately, but in mint Grin-
Dell on the other hand showed a
tendency to loaf, and it was not until
near the end of the second half that
the Scarlet and Black players awoke
to the iact that they must play toolr
ball ii victory was to be theirs. When
they did regain consciousness they
played iast and furious and scored a
touchdown in short Order.

The day was ideal for the popular
game and all or Mt Vernon was out in
force on the side lines. Cornell chose
the south goal and Valerius kicked
off. From the very start it was evi-
dent that Cornell was playingaliie
and death game and she surprised
both her friends and opponents by the
ﬁerce assault which was made on the
Grinnell line. Neither side was able
to gain consistently but Grinnell was
really outplayed the ﬁrst hall. The
half closed With the ball in Cornell’s
possession on her own in yard line,
Score 0 to 0.

In the second half, Griunell began
the attack which ultimately resulted
in ntollclldou n. End runs by Blea‘
master and smashes through Cornell‘s
right tackle by Elannigan, slowly but
surely forced the ball towards the
Methodis 5 goal. ‘Vith the billion

ways been interesting and exciting.
Last year’s contest was won by Simp-

game that Joe Wallesar, Grinnell's
midget end, secured the ball twice on
fumbles and ran the whole length of

be postponed and every Gl'innell root-
er needs to bepn the Side lines. This
will be your last opportunity oi seeing
the team in action, Let every rooter
be present to cheer the team on to
the greatest victory of the season,

SCRUBS WIN FROM NORMAL.

The Iowa College Second Team Surprises
ihc Newmn Normaliles and
Wins a Victory.

By a series of fast, well massed plays
Yhe Scrubs succeeded in defeating the
much lioavierteam oi' Newton Normal
School, Saturday by a score of 18 to or
The game throughout was hard fought
and void or any sensational features
with the exception ofcnce near the
latter end oi the second ball when the
Normal securing the ball on the
Scrubs’ forty-ﬁve yard line by repeated
line smashes forced it within one foot
ofGrinnell's goal line. The Scrubs
braced here however and forcing New~
ton to give up the ball punted out of
danger.

At the beginning Newton won the
toss and received the kick but failed
to make her gains. The Scrubs then
took the ball and Jacobs, around the
end for ten yards, went overi‘or the
ﬁrst touchdown witliiu ﬁve minutes
from the time the referee’s whistle
announced the ball in play, The
second score was made in about the
same length of time with Clinuiniu
around the end for seven yards. The
third touchdown was made near the
middle olthe second half when Clin-
diuln with n boostfrom Jacobs hurdled
the line in: a three yard gain and
landed directly between the goal posts.

Traiton, who because ofan injured
arm did not enter the game until the
lirst half was about over, was easily
Newton’sslar. He played the posi-
[ion or lertlialrnnd had speed which
combined with his weight, ifproperly
supported, would have made the
Scrubs a dillicult proposition, but the
Normals team work was not good.
They played much better ball during
the second hull and near the end their
weight began to tell edecciicly against
their light oppoiienis. At no time in

the game were they able to make cou—
sistenr g1 - around Grillllell's ends,
