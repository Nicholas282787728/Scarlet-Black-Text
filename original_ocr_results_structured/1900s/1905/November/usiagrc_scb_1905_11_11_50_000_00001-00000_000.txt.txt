lOWA COLLEGE, GRlNNELL, IOWA, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER ll, 1905.

THE UvaERsiTY PROBLEM.

Dean Muhiui ihc Chapel Services, Sug-
gesls a New Phase or the Preseni
Discussion in Educational
Circles.

The quest on which has been uppen
mostin (he minds of erlllclltols in re-
cent years is, "\Vill the small college
sul’Vi 9‘?" It has seemed as though
the small college holild be entirely
crowded out of our present education
:11 system. More and more has the
high school on one side and the univer»
sity on the other ellcroaehed upon the
ﬁeld oi the college proper. But recent
discussions have suggested anew point
of View, and it was to ”The Problem
of the University” that Dean Main
called the attention 01' the students at
the Friday morning service.

The Dean lirst dehned a university
as it is represented in the great insti-
tutions of America and then described
the German universities. From our
standpoint the university is a central
college and a group or schools or
colleges, such as the colleges or medi-
cine, law, etc. The university in a
broad way represents universal knowl-
edge. The college of Liberal Arts in
a university makes the same require-
ments ior graduation as does a college
like Grimiell. In their schools of law
and medicine, however, their admit-
tance requirements are much easier.

In short, our American universities
arc ior the most part iilled with com-
mon school students.

In Germany the conditions are vast
lydiiierent. The university student
has had thorough training beiorchand
in the gymnasium and other schools.
Helms acquired the theory oi knowl-
edge in his preliminary woili; he now
learns the practice at the nnirersi .
There is no basis or comparison be.
tween Bellih University and Ilarvard,
or any other Amel can university, un.
less it be in the graduate department.
There are only two graduate schools or
medicine in the United States, liar-
vard and Johns ilopliins. and linriard
,and co. ihia cm L! only two hot n
gridu ilc schools oi w, in all oi ihc
[grddualc lloolsLllei‘eiii'e only about

_ Thus we scuihere is no comparison

between the two.

The ll'H on now ccniiontiiig lhe
univer icy i “Ildsll't theliniit olelli»
ciency been reache The univer-
sity, strictly speaking. is just beglih
hing to be. The uni ver ties have
grown in numbers by encroaching tips
on the work 01' secondary schools, but
they should grow at the top and do the
proper worlv oi a university. The real
diiliculty rests not in the college but
in the university. ii the university
problem is settled, the college problem
becomes easy. it will throw imma-
turestudents into the college where
deﬁnite ideas can be Iormed. The
small college will survive, ii itdesei-ves
to survive. There is a new day for the
college in the educational development
which is before us. Thecollege assucli
has a contribution which no other in.
stitution can make. The college is go
ing to becomealnoie dominant factor.
It has to do permanently, with life it-
self. Lite will have more value in the
future.

WiLL PREVENT BRUTALITY.

The Grinnell Humane Society Will Have
Ofﬁccis on Field Today in Prevent
Rough Playing.

The iollowingestruca liom last even-
ihg’s Hoiulll shows the attitude which
the peacciul-loving citwnsoi Grilillell
have towards the game. The society
has become convinced that President
Roosevelt is right and they are going
to ZlSSlSL hiin intlie wicidingol the big
stick. A low arrests this aitcrnoon
would add special interest to the game
and ii the practice was continued, we
predict that Ward Field will be
crowded with interested spectators at
the next game.

When the great annual! football
contest between the teams or the
Iowa State College and or Iowa 001-
legu is called on “hard Field tumor<
rcw niieincon it will be in the pres-
(more of representatives of the Grin.
nell Humane Society who will be

whether or not the players on either
