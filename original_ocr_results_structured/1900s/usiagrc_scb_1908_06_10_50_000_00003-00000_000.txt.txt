Yesterday a new feature of com.
iueiicenient week was inaugurated
when the alumni picnic was held on
the campus. At. noon the various
classes arranged theihseli'es'in groups
and an adequate picnic lunch was
served. alter which an hour or two
were spent indulging in reminiscences
of college days. giving the old familiar
yells and eniov ig lite as only an
alumnus is ng his aims mater
knows liow‘to enjoy himself, There
was no set program or formality of
any sort and indeed it was this in-
formality which made the affair so
great a success.
