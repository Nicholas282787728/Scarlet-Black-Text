Of the most enjoyable features of the
le program was the vocal solo by
essie Christian. who ’

\Villlain E. Paul of the Olli'estos
lnatllian Society had chosen for his
subiect "The Art of Home-making,"
‘and inadetile ﬁrst address. He brielly

traced the development OI tllc home:
the gradual transi’ei or the government
of the home from the hands 01' the
husband to tlloseof tile win ontvast-
ed the conditions of the c unLry and
. ‘llome: and round the principle in-
ved in real llolnesbuildiug to be that

Miss Currie Ulil of the Ellis Society,
who was the socond speaker, gave an
interesting tail; upon “Tile Greei:
Dlama. Miss Ulll’s words were Cares
hilly chosen and her thought clearly
evpvcsscd. The origin 01 the Greek
drama was given and the development
and decay of the Greek chorus A con-
trast was drﬂiin between the Greek
and the mod Il drama. Unlike the
modern author wiio tries to have orig-
innl Characters, the Greek author
sought to have his characters represent
a type. Miss Uhl closed her remarks
with a statement of the iulllience of
the Greek drama upon succeeding
ages.

Henry L. Janles oI Grinnell Institute
ricxt spoke upon the subject, "The
Final Standar: of Worth." .‘Il’. allies

delivery, and showed ma od
improvement over his wcrir of ist
3 ear. He discussed the dillei‘eiit aims
OI hie as propounded by dill'ereilt
philosophers and found the real oblect
is the highest development of the in-
dividual. Character is the great aim
of life.

Charles R. Barnard, DI the Chrestos
m athian society followed with a speech
upon “The Justiﬁcation of a Coliegeof
the owa Type.” lIcfound tilislllsti»
ﬁcationln the work that the sinzill
college can do for young people, which
cann t be done by the large uiii-
vel es. The college iiasa work of
its own and its importance will not be
overshadowed by the position and in-
ﬂuence or the university.

Miss Eleanor Lowden of the Calooa-
gatiiian Society, was the next Speaker,
her subject being “The Criticism of
Cc-Educatiori.” he was particularly
strong and received vigorous applause.
The principal criticisms or the co-
educational system were clearly stated
and eoectively answered. These crit-
icisms are that it tends to eﬂ'eininize
the institution; that certain sublects
cannot be taught So well in mixed
classes; that it tends to make‘ the
work of the college we emotional and»
sensational. Our whole American
life is basedon the rinei 19. involved
in oO-ellueation, an woul ‘ need to be
Completely revolutionized if its prin»
ciplcs were abandoned.

Miss Katharine Macy oﬁ the Ellis

01

society chose for her subject, “The

Arts and Cram Movement.” The

Clear thought and ,-

oblect of the movement is to secure
individual expression on the part of
workmen. This was possible in the
middle es. beroi-e inventions had
revolutioui d industrial liie. But the
use of machinery has tended to make
the workman himself a mere machine
line this is not an inevitable result
and the object or the arts and crafts
i movement is to developa taste for the
aesthetic, and a purpose to make the
niachiuescrve individual expression.

Henry G. Weber. oi orinneil Instr

in a clear manner the southerlier's

COMMENCEMENT CONCERTS.

On Tuesday between the hours or
2:00 and 2:30 p. m. occurred the after-
noon program of the Griiiuell Oratorio
Society, composed of selections by the
artists, together \v' ll Mr. Dudley
Smith as accompanist. who were to
assist in the rendering oi llaydn’s
“Creation” of whichthe evening pro-
gram consisted.

The RiedelsbergerrHeiglltonString
Quartet opened the program and was
very well received. Mr. Cowper, who
is no stranger to Griiincll audiences,
sang two selections from Handel’s
“.leptha" and in responsetopcrsistent
applause lie pleased the audience with
the old favorite “Belldelneer's
Stream.” Those who love the violin
ivci'c not disappointed in the double
number by Mr. lliedelsberger. Mrs.
ivilsou’s part on the program was
very warmly appreciated and as a re-
ward ror their persevel" nce ti audi-
ence received “Ah Irish Folk" song.
M Wilson uotonly has a beautiful
voice but also a gracious manner-
i\liicli is very acceptable to a Griniiell
audience. Although the audience
was not large it was enthusiastic and
the program even if less elaborate
than last year- compared very [oven
ably. Only those who w -e not pres-
out have cause for regret.

THE minimum.

In the evening Ilaydn's “Creation"
was presented by the Oratorio Society
under the direction of Henry \V.
Matlzlclt. Mrs. lVilsou, Mr. Cowper
and \Vllllam l3. Olds took the lezi ling
parts, and the Quartet and Mr. smith
were the dccolllpailists.

The work of the chorus was exceed-
illgly good and it surpassed anything
that has ever been given before. The
voices all blended together in perfect
harmony, showing the good training
they had received under Mr. Matlaclv‘.
They were somewhat handicapped by
riotliaving the organ, as the chorus
was rather too heavy for the Quartet
but all things considered their work

was excellent.

STUDENT LIBRARY FUND.

The movement ivlllcli was started
among the students a row iveelrs ago
by Mr. Williams, has been brought to
asiiccessiul close. Near] ‘ )Dllas been
pledged for the new library bythe stil-
dent body. This exceeds the sum
which was originally planned by $100,
and it speaks \vell tor the interest. that
tllestudents have taken inthismatter.

The majority or the students signed
pledges, although there were several
who refused for various reasons.

Thelibrai-y is now an assured tiring
and Wllen it iscompleted. the students
who have contributed now, can in
after years look back with pleasure to
the part which they took in this
matter.
