Underclassmnn on College Council
Editor 3. to 3.:

Tlie proposed

oil, it seems to me, is radically

wrong. ”President Main in his

annual report sars: “The pur~

pose of the Council is to engender

the spirit of democracy." Surely
any plan which would keep the
underclzlssnien from participation
in the carrying on 01 College nt-
lnil‘s, is not only undemocratic,
but «unfair in ei'el'y particular.

Reorganization is doubtless Wise,

but along the proposed lines, is

radically undesirable from the
underclnssnien's view.

EiiFrom the record of the pro-
ceedings of their meeting last night
the above communication from a
Freshman would seem to be typical of
the attitude of that .cldss.

What is the function of the College
Council as it was created three years
ago? As we understand it, the idea
uppermost at the time it was formed
was the establishment of at body which
would keep the Faculty in touch with
student opinion. What are then the
essential features to secure such u re
sult‘? De-
mocracy? Certainly, dud, although we

Rem'esentatirelless? Yes,
know not what plan the Council may
be considering. we would surely on»
pose any plan uliich did not giro el'r
ery class representation

Above other things. the
Council must have snuitr and reason.

This end, we bclicrc, can best be serv-

A Communication.

This communication. coming irom
an upperclnsslndn, contains at suggesr
tion at least worthy of consideration:

Any one who has poked around

the library looking tor a inﬂgu
zinc. soon rcnlizes that it would
expedite his business as well us
keep him from disturbing others,
it the magazines were to be tound
on the magazine rack. This would
be very convenient also.

In all libraries where such cons
rcnieoce is desired, one is re-
quired to return magazines to the
rack. And such or rule would
not only prove convenient and ex-

pedite one's business, but would

was to have consisted of the works of
Nordish and Italian composers. It is
probable that the last program, an-
nounced as a request program, will

be abandoned and the one postponed
from today substituted [or ’ Fur~

ther notice will be round in those not

unius.
The cause for the postponeni’eut is
the Professor’s poor physical condition
and s physician's order that all unr
necessary work be dispensed with.
