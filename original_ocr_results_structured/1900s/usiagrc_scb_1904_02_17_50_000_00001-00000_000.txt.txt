The Vesper service was also led
by Dean Main, whose address was
an cnlargementupon the last sug-
gestion in the morning's lesson.
Christ constantly exhorted men
to do, not merely to think. He
himself set our great example by

,choosing to live a liie of rich ser-

vice rather than to formulate a
creed. Itis only in giving the
“cup of cold water" that man at
rains his highest spirituality,

The rendition of the last num-

from Lougtcllow's Hiawatha, the
music of which was written by
