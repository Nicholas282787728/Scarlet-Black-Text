HOUGH the failule of stur

mentioned in these columns in

0 every human being will
come times of hittersor-
row, when nothing seems at any
use for lessening the pain. In
such times friends can only look
on in silent sympathy, tor no
words can wipe out the present.
To the family of Mrs, R. Gonna-

extends a must sincere sympathy
in their recent bereavement, and
a hope that their strength may be
made cnough to bear their great
sorrow
