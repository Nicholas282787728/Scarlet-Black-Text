TAFT FAILED To APPEAR.

Cause not Known, but Arrangements
will Probably be Made tor a
Later Date.
A more unfortunate incident
could hardly be imagincd than
that which Dcfell the audience as
scmblcd to hear Lorado Tait

deliver his lecture last night.
The nonrarrival of a lecturer who
is expected to appear is a hereto-
fore unknown experience in Grin-
nell. although other towns have
at times been visited by the inis.
fortune. That it was the opening

number of the lecture course
makes the matter all the more
deeply regretted by the commit»
toe in charge. It is customary
for a'lecturer to notify those hav»
ing the matter in charge as soon
as he ﬁnds he cannot keep nis ape
pointmcnt. and the absence of

such notiﬁcation is considered
sufﬁcient guarantee of his appear.
When Mr. Taft failed to

appear on the attcrnoon trains. a

ance.

telegram was setit to the western
oﬂ'ice of the lecture bureau which
scheduled his dates, asking tor an
explanation. butnnne earns. and

all that could be done was to
trust to his appearance on the
early evening tiains. His iailure
to do so caused the kcenest disapr
pointment and regret to those
striving to make a success of the
course. It is sinccrcly hoped that
a like inconvenience will never
occur again and all possible pre-
cautions will bc taken to that etr
tect, although the local cominit-
tee is practically powerless in the
matter. The movements of an
individual cannot be controlled.
At present no explanations can
be given for Mr. Taft's failure to
appear. Telephone inquiry re.
veals the fact that he was to have
come out from Chicago, but why
he did notI cannot be ascertained.
Holders of tickets are requested
to keep their seat checks and as
soon as deﬁnite arrangements are
made for supplying the vacant
date, announcement will be made
through SCARLET AND BLACK and
the town papers and the checks

may be exchanged for tickets.

 

ATHLETIC UNION MEETING.

Don Evans, ’03, Elected Captain—E. H.
Spaulding Declined to Serve as
Manager Next Year.

A meeting of the Athletic Union
was held in Blair Hall yesterday
afternoon at one o‘clock to con
sider the recommendation of the
'Varsity for captain and manager
of next year's team and listen to
the report of committees. Don
Evans called the meeting to order
and. in the absence of the secre-
tary, appointed James McKeag
secretary pro tem. Acting asa
committtee from the ’Varsity. E.
HSpaulding presented their re-
commendation of himself for
manager and Don Evans tor
captain of the [902 team. Mr.
spaulding stated, however, that
he was not present at the meeting
of the ‘Varsity, when the recom~
niendations were made. and took
the opportunity for declining the
proHered ofﬁce.

Mi. Evans received the urn
animous vote of the Union for
captain, but the question of see
:eeting a manager was reterred to
the ’Varsity for further recom-
mendation.

Mr. H. G. Lyman, asa mem-
ber of the committee appointed
to investigate the promiscuous
wearing of the letter ”G" and the
track emblem on caps and college
pins, reported that according to
the constitution of the Athletic
Union. which was adopted in 1900,
there was no such a thing as the
honor ”G". The Committee rc-
commended. however, that a
committee be appointed to center
with some institution such as the
University of Wisconsin and
learn the conditions under which
the initial letter is worn as a re-
ii-ard of merit. The report was
acceptcd and a motion carried
that a committee be appointed as

recommended by Mr. Lyman.

LECTURE 0N ART.

Samuel Strauss to Lecture in chapel
To.morrow Night—A\ Business
Man and Art Critic.

Thursday evening the students
of Iowa College will have the rare
opportunity ot hearing an address
on “Art” by one who has devoted
much time to its study and who
is eminently ﬁtted to speak on
such a Mr.
Strauss is one of the proprietors
of the Des Moines Lead” and
will come to our college out ot the
whirl oi ahusy man’s lite. He is,
however, not alone a successful
man of the business world but al-
so a student and scholar of much
culture and reﬁnement, Popular
fancy has sometimes connected
Mr. Strauss‘ name with the
“Matclot on Themes Dramatic"
«it the Des Moines Lmd’ll, which
has attracted considerable notice
among eastern dramatic critics.
However that may be, he is known
in Des Moines and throughout
the state as a speaker and critic
of unusual ability, on literature
and art.

A wide traveller, Mr. Strauss
has just returned from a trip
abroad during which he was study
ing art in European galleries and
comparative religions and it is
superﬂuous to say that he hasa
wealth of knowledge, from which
to speak to Iowa College students

To those who heard Mr. Strauss
here two years ago when he spoke
on the subject, “The Jew," further
notice is unnecessary. To others
SCARLET AND BLACK would say
that they can hardly afford to let
pass such a chance of hearing one
of Iowa’s foremost scholars and
busmess men.

THE INTER-SOCIETY DEBATE.

Annuni Contest Between the chresto
and Institute Societies, Saturday
Evening. in the chapel.

We wish to call the attention of
every student and member of the
taculty to the coming Chresto-In-
stitute debate and to brieﬂy ex-
plain why you cannot afford to
miss it. First, you will be enter-
tained. Thedehatersareeach pre-
pared to give a live, interesting
talk. Miss Smith has been faith-
fully training them in delivery and
this fact will no doubt be made
evidentSaturday night. Moreover
the contest will be close; it is gen—
erally conceded that the negative
have the the more favorable side
of the question, and the aFﬂrma»
tive the more experienced debat-
ers.

Second, you Will be instructed.
The question is alive ‘one. The
ship-subsidy bill aroused wide-
spread discussion last year; the im~
portance of the question was em»
phasized in Roosevelt's annual
message last week; and only this
week a new bill was introduced in
congress. In no other way can
you gain as much knowledge ot
the question in an equal amount ct
time as you can by hearing this de<
bate.

Third, you owe your support to
the college. Our debating repu-
tation is not what it should be. It
takes the whole school to produce
a successful team. Let us show
our college spirit in this as we have
done in football. Let us begin
now to win the Washburn debate.

and on Saturday night let us ﬁll
the chapel to the doors.
