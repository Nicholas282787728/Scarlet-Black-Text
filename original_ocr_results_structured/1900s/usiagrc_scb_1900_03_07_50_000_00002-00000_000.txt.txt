Qﬁhitorial

WE ARE GLAD to note the inter
est in basket ball which is being
aroused by the series of inter-class
games now in progress. Basket
ball stands at the front among in-
door sports, and no college or uni—
versity which has adequate gyms
nasium accommodations is with—
out a team. During the winter
just passed, intercollegiate basket
ball games have been ot common
occurrence. Teams representing
the universi es of Iowa and Wisr
cousin have played the University
of Minnesota team in Minneapor
lis, and the Minnesota team has
also taken several trips while bas-
ketball games have been common
among the colleges ofIlIinols and
Wisconsin, To bring the matter
yet closer home, we may say that
within the last few days a proposV
al from the Des Moiues Y. M. C.
A.. with reference to a game to be
played in Des Moines. has been
refused, owing to the fact that we
have no strictly college team
This goes to show the prominent
place which basket ball has as-
sumed, and thc still more promi-
nent position which it bids fair to
occupy Allhouvh the unavoida
ble delay which dlldlllled the be
ginning of work in the new gyrnr
nasinm, last winter, madea college
basket ball team an impossibility,
we feel that there is no reason
why, in another year. Iowa Col.
lege should not be amongthe ﬁrst
to enter the new ﬁeld which is
opening. The classgamesalready
played have demonstrated that
we have good material and if the
enthusiasm which now exists can

President Gates spoke on several
matters only directly conterning
“the family” and hence the gist of
these remarks must be‘ held' ‘
conﬁdence. ‘Theeﬁort was str
ly of the “heart to heart',’ variety,
so characteristic of Friday mom‘-
ings, and iouncl a hearty welcome
by the alumni present.
