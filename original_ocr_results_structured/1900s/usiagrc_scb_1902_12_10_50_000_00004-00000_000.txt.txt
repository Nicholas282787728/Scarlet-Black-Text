ADVERTISXNG IOWA COLLEGE.

The campaign of college adverr
tising which was begun two years
ago is being continued more vigor
ou'sly than ever this year. Results
are already favorable, as is shown
by the increase of ﬁfty students
this year. The policy of the col
legc executives is to advertise the
school ,in .every legirnate way.
Grinncll's courses are the highest
class, no College in the state does
superior work and her reputation
iii the east is greater than that ol
any other-Iowaschool. The worh
done is thoroughly and the iti-
structors are far above the average

henslve and extended, including
university extension lectures by
the taculty, glee club and arches
tra trips, and other methods, be~
sides various pieces of college
literature, such as the News LII/(r,
Circular, SCARLET AND BLACK and

others. Two productions will

soon be ready for distribution
that will he very appropriate and
useiul in spreading the name or
Iowa college. The new twelve
panel calendar will soon be ﬁnish-
ed, and is a beauty, while the new
red book that is soon to come out
is certainly a ivork' of art. This
is somewhat on the plan of the
red book of two years ago, erir
larger] and improved. Both will
be ready for distribution before
the Christmas holidays and both
are very appropriate bits of col
lege advertising. The calendar
will be sent to nearly all the
prominent high schools of the
state, and the red book will also
be distributed where there are
prospective students.

It is to he hoped a laige crowd
will be present to give support to
their respective teams. The stip-
port which these games have will
to some extent determine the
nuinbcrof outside games to be
played here.

If basket ball does not have the
loyal support of the student body
it will be necessary to arrange to
play the games on grounds other
than our own.
