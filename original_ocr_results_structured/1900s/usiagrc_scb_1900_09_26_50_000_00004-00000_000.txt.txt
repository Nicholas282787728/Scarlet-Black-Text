Arrangements are bclllg made
to have the Fall Home Field-
mcet some time in thc very near
future. while the weather is favor-
able. In previous years. the meet
has lrequently been placed at such
a late date, that cold weather and
the poor condition of the track
has forbade having any meet at
all. it is especially desirable to
give the new material a handicap
experience this tall. not only to
encourage them but also to enable
the management to get some kind
ot a torecast on our showing tor
next spring. Capt. Foster will
complete his plans in a tow days.
and acquaint track men with the
same in another issue of the SCAR-
LET Axo BLACK,

The Alumnl Llne-up.
Manager Somers, ot the alumni
football team, is not able, at pres-

ent writing, to say just who will,

compose the lino-tip in next Sat-
urday’s game. The positions will
be ﬁlled, however, from the fol-
lowing candidates: J. F. Reed,
'95. Chas Rawson, e. '38, c. E.
Harris, ’96, J, B. Grinnell, '94, C,
M. Calderwood, ’00, R. M. I-laines,
Jr ’95, P, E. Somers, ’94. J. F.
Dai‘by,’95, A. R. Ctaty, ’94, w. 5.
Pierce, '99, Paul Norris. ’98. w.
Knapp. '00. B. B. Gray. '97, Chas.
Halnes, ’98. J. F. Darby, A. R.
Crary and B. B. Grey may not be
able to come at the last moment,
which leaves the probable line-up
in some doubt. It is the aim of
Manager Sonnets to put as strong
a team on the ﬁeld next Saturday
as the alumni can furnish. He
wishes to inaugurate the custom of
alumni football playing with as
strong a showing as possible, and
also to give the 'Varsity plenty of
hard \VO|l(.

Football.
Just previous to the ﬁrst foot-
ball game at the season, it is in-
teresting to look over the general

condition of affairs up to present
date and to speculate upon prob-
able prospects for the future.

In the ﬁrst place, Coach Hariis
arrived this morning and made his
ﬁrst appearance on the gridiron
this afternoon, He enters upon
the work of coaching the team
with his oldstime energy and en-
thusiasm, which can not fail to in-
spire. to some degiee at least, the
same qualities in the men under
his charge. Thus far, the teams
have been considerably handr
capped through lack of sufﬁcient
coaching, though Paul Norris, one
of our former backs, has most
hindly given his services and done
all in his power to supply the
pressing needs in that direction.
But, now, with “Jack" to put the
men in conditioniantl we have
had previous examples oi Jack's
ability in that line—and “Doc" to
teach the science at the game,
things should take on a brighter
hue. Speed, more perfect forma-
tion and better team wotk in run-
ning inteticrcncc are some ot the
particular articles Grinnell must
have it she desires to make any
hind or a showing in the coming
games.

The candidates, who will rcpt-c.
sent the college in the alumni
game next Saturday, will prob-
ably be picked from the following:
Center#l%aggs, Dunn, Blather-
wick; tackles—Zeigler, Fellows,
Mdclnryl‘e, sruith; gttal'dsiKels
ley, l-loivell, Lewis, McKeag,
Parks; ends7Chase,Boyle,i\’loore,
Digitan. Benson Day, Illeld;
qilal‘terbacks— an,Smith,Fisite,
Morrison; halves Evans. Lyman.
Fostet. McCarty, Walker, Listet,
VanDike; full—j. Clark, W. Clat k.

Three positions on the team can
be assigned with tolerable accut's
acy. Fellows returned to school
Monday, and will doubtless play
his old position at tackle. Fislce
is almost ccttain to occupy his
position at quarter, and Capt.
Douglass will play end. The re
lmatntng eight positions must be
ﬁlled with new men and at pres-
ent writing it is extremely proo-
lematical just who ot the new ma-
terial will be chosen.
