Commissinuei' Dl' EduCﬂLIOil the fol-
lowing lncts lire taken:

In the college. Illie Knrih AL

including New England. Vew York.
Pennsylvania allil some others, the
ratio 0 Lilrlenls to one college Leach-
el‘is9 [O l. in the North Central
which . our own division the ratio is
10m 1. The statistics are lion Very
reliable. For examine, Harvard has
the low i‘aLio of 8 7 Lo 1, but a large
share or her teaching ioree is engaged
in teaching Very Small classes or grad-
uate SLurleiirs, while in the under
grnduute work there are some classes
of 200, 300, 400 and even 5 0 students
On the other hand many institutions
enumerate as college teachers those
who also do preparatory work. Again,
in some cases assistants are listed as
instructors. According to the last
commissioner's report there are
rourteen colleges in Iowa hav-
ing fewer than one hundred stu-
dents each, and the ratio of college
students is 3.3m one instructor. Any-
one acquainted with Iowa conditions
knows that these instructors are
doing largely preparatory work. From
the statistics and personal
knowledge of conditions in cer-
tain schools, it would appeal' that.
for the best sort of college work there
is ii. ratio that should not be exceeded,
and thatit is about ﬁfteen students
to one college instructor.

Equrrimhr.

Tile equipment of a modem, good
college is Very expensive. It is selfe
evident that a. college must have room
adequately to house its work. It must.
have also adequate laboratories and a
good library.

Thus far I have been talking about
things that are measurable, Which
are necessary to the carrying on or
good college work. There are other
things quite as real and quiteasiru—
portnnt. though not so easily subject
to any Standard of measurement. We
sometimes refer to them collectively
as the spirit oracollege. Let a few
words silﬂlce.

Colleges like indi iduztls have their
dlﬁerent personalities and tempera-
ments. 1 am convinced that colleges
are not so dlEferent in this respect. as
we sometimes imagine. Neverthe-
less. while some appear rather stupid
and slow. others appear iull of energy
and enthusiasm; while some are rather
selﬁsh and mater listlc. others are
markedly altruistic and spiritual; in
some divlslori and disc/0rd seem to
reign.in others unity and brotherhood.
In the good college, there must. be a
wholesome and stimulating academic
atmosphere. Thereinustbeiritellecl‘r
iml and moral enthusistm; there must
boasplrit of loyalty to the college,
and of unity. cooperation and help-
{illness not only between Students and
Students, but also between teachers
and students. The goorl college must
be intellectually free: that is. it must
not be under the intellectual duminion
of any other necullar system or creed.
bull must be frPe to discuss. adopt and
Ranch the best ideas the world lizis to
