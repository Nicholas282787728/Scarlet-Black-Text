QED ﬂuvial

IS mind withstood the strain
lot two long weeks without
a half dozen items coming to him
through the mail, but now that a
iortnight more brought onlyatour
short messages with which to ﬁll
eight columns oi alumni news the
haid pressed alumni editor has
plunged into hopeless delirium.
”There would be news,” he moans,
”iftheywerealive,"andnoamount
or reasoning can get out of his
head the notion that most ofthose
- who have taken degrees in tormer
years troni Iowa College have
lately been swept into the other
world by the ravages or a dreadiul
malady. his thought thattwelve
letters a day tor six weeks \l'lll
restore his wandering intellect to
its normal condition. \Vill the
alumni subscribers of SCARLET
AND BLACK rally to his rescue?
Orif his frenzied dream is not
fancy but tact will some surviving
graduate mail us a few hundied
obituaries?

ELDOM has there been a
deed performed at Iowa
College or elsewhere that speaks
more for the loyalty, the spirit
and tlte unity of an institution
than does the act at the young
women ot the college in raising a
fund to provide ottr football team
outﬁts commensurate with ils
dignity. The ladies went to the
Ames game expecting to see a
hard con’est with a close score
and even with hopes lot a Grin
nell v.ctory. They came away
disappointed but more fully con
vittced than ever that Grinnell
plays better football pnnnd tot
pounil than can he iound any
tthcre else tllltler the sun.

us that he will be thoroughly ene
joyed.

Dr. Hetbett L. \Villet's extene
sion lectures two years ago
aroused mtlch enthusiasm. A
more ﬁnished and genuinely elo-
quent speaker has not been heard
in Grinncll for years.

The name, McCutclleon the
cartoonist, suggests all sorts of
pleasant associations. Hundreds
of people are looking forward to
seeing and hearingthe man whose
pictures they look tor daily.

l\’l|2 Samuel Strauss, of the New
York Commercial Advertiser, will
speak on the American drama.
All those who have heard Mr.
Strauss before are anxious to hear
him again, and all others will be
interested in his theme. It is a
subjectoi broad interest and Mr.
Strauss will treat it intelligently
and well.

Altogether the course
strong and as costly a one as has
ever been given here and itmerits
t'he patronageoi all good meme
bers of the community. The ad
vancc sale of tickets has been
fairly large, but a good many
more should be sold to make the
course ﬁnancially successful.
