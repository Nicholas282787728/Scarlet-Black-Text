Faculty Changes ior Next Year.

Nearly every year sees not only
a constant change in the pdrsmmzl
of the student body brrt chang-
es in the faculty as well. Students
and triends are particularly sorry
to learn of Prof. and Mrs. Cole's
resignations lrom their positions
in the School of Music. They
have been so closely connected
with college affairs outside of
their regular work that their loss
will be asevere one. Prof. Cole
has made no deﬁnite plans for
next year other than that he dee
sires to pursue more closely his
favorite work of composition.

_They have many, many friends
among former graduates and
among the people they will leave
in Grinnell. The resignation of
Miss Hill, piano instructress, was
also accepted by the faculty com-
mittee of the trustees. She has
been connected with the conserv-
atory for the past three years.

summer resort in the state of New
York. whereaChatanqnaassembly

A Call to Debaters,

bates.l<ind otworkdone,rimespcn;

good scheme for all those who
have taken part in past debates.
who intend to do so in the future
and those who merely have a gen-
eral interest in debating matters,
to meet in conference and draw up
a paper containing all the data
useful to a solution of the problem
now confronting lowa College.
This paper might then be submib
ted to the faculty. The matter of
inter-collegiate debating and how
it shall be encouraged is certainly
a problem not yet solved. The
taculty oi Iowa College is always
disposed to be fair and to meet
the students half way in all reason-
able undertalrings._ If students
and faculty cooperate, debating
arrangements may be tnade more
satisfactory. The students can do
their part by submitting the paper

The May Luncheon.

For several years our sister in»
stitutions have served May Morti-
ing breakiasts, through the aus»

pices of the Y. W, C. A., which
according to reports were very

pleasant and proﬁtable. Cone
sidering the fact that the May
Festival is to be given next week
it was deemed best by those in
charge to serve a luncheon next
Monday trom 5 o'clock to 7. The
campus is at present so beauliiul
that it has been decided it‘would
be very pleasant to serve the
luncheon out of doors, The south

Sophomores Give Program.

The third or a series of class
programs was given by the Sopho-
mores of the Institute society
Wednesday evcning. The scene
of action was that of a country
school room where the school-
master’sgreatest ﬁeld or labor lay
in the disciplining of his six rustic
pupils who made life miserable for
each other as well as their in-
structor.

Dressed in the garb ota coni-
mon country lad they read such
compositions and essays as would
do a college rnan credit, making
new and then a pun on some of
the unfortunate people in their
audience. It is needless to say
that they created much laughter
and comment in the audience.
These class programs have proven
very favorable to the society work
of this term. affording much
amusementandstillbringingiorth
some good work on the part of
the society members. The next
class program will occur one week
from next Wednesday and will be
in charge ot the Freshmen.

A Long-felt Want: Supplied.

Arrangements have been made
whereby a longefelt need of the
students will be supplied. At the
beginning of the ensuing fall term.
Librarian Douglass willdelivertwo
or more lectures upon the use of
the libi ary. This information will
be given especially tor the beneﬁt
of the new students who are ex
pected to enter college at that
time, but it Will be to the advant-
age of all to attend the lectures.
tor there are comparatively iew
students, especially amongthe un-
der—Classmen, who have a requisite
knowledge of the library and its
system of working. That these
lectures ﬁll a longish need is
shown by the fact that Mr. Doug-
lass hasthCe been invited to speak
rrpon the subject before the college
literarysocietiesthisyear. Sever~
al charts have been made to illus~
hate the system upon which the
library is conducted. Every stu-
dent who rs not thoroughly ac»
quaintedivilhthelibraryshouldat-
tend these lectures, for so many

library books are used in our col-
legeworkthat aclose acquaintance
with them is necessary both in
saving the time of the librarian and
that of the student.
