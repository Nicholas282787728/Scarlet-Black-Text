FOOTBALL COMMENT.

Alter the gttmc Satttt day. sever
al things are \l'orlhy of notice.
More through the poor playing of
Antes. perhaps, than through the
good playing or Grlnitell the game
was a tie. Yet the result ought to
be pleasing to Grinnell. Ames
has trained longer. has had a coach
with her team right along. and in
every position but one had heavier
men. Ames‘ men were most of
them new to college football. but
so are several of the Grinnell team

Another noticeable point about
Gi-tnuell's game at Marshalltown
was her team work. The only
reason why Ames. ivrth her heavier
line and backs. was not able to
tvalkthrougltGrrnnell tvas because
of the latter's superior team work.
It is a matter oi congratulation
that there was no attempt to do ine
dividual playinggran‘drsland play
ing. by any Grinnell player.

While the team showed many
points where there is room [or im-
provement. on the whole theshow-
ing made was very satisfactory.
Grinnell held the heavier team for
downs time after time. and when
they rcccivcdthe ball. managed to
keep it in Ames' territory most or
the time. twice coming within a
few feet of a touch down.

Butthereisanother point where

the game was not so pleasing.
Ames brought to Marshalltowti
nearly four hundred routers, while
hardly morethantiventy-ﬁve Grin-
nell students accompanied the

HANDICAP RACE AT THE FAIR
GROUNDS, FRIDAY
AT 4 F. M.

The following men are expect
ed to take part in the one hundred
and twenty yard handicap race
next Friday afternoon. The list
is not complete owing to the [act
that a number of football candi-
dates who expeci to compete.
have not handed in their names.
Trainer Watson wants every foute
ball man to compete who does
not play in the Drake game

Owing to the Ward Field track
not being cleared. the contest
must be held at the Fair Grounds.
The ﬁrst heat will be started at
four o'clock.

Thecli'dilge rrom Saturday to
Friday is made necessary because
of the change in the date of the
game with Drake.
