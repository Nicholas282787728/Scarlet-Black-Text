Last Wednesday's program at Insti-
tute was given entirely by the older-
members and was a good illustration
of the ability which work in a literary
society gives, Each number- was well
prepared and well delivered. Ilerhert
Wintersteirr opened with a prepared
oration on “Henry George and His
Theories". Scott )iciiaoliron spoke
extelnporaneouslv on "The Xelv Cabl-
iiet Members," and Louis Hopkins
read a humorous sketch entitled "Pigs
is Pigs.” The regular discussion oi
the evening iollorved. It was upon
the evils of tree railroad passes and
the two sides were led by XOI‘man
Blatlrerwick and Earl Smiley. Dwight
Breed then gave an exteniporancous
tall: on ”The Two Iowa Political Plate
forms,” and Miss Suckow closed the
program with a deliglitiul solo, The
Institute society is considering the
adoption or a society pinu

Lewis LITE n .

The Lewis Literary society held a
rather unique program Wednesday
evening, in the loot that. it was a pier
gram devoted to the study or social-
ism. A single diversion Ir-onr this pro-
gram was made at the beginning when
II. 1]. Whoaton, ‘01, addressed the so-
ciety on "How to prepare for the Pier
liminai-y Debate." Mr. Wireaton‘s
talk was iull or good aillice which he
had learned from e. erience. l‘icams
then spoke on “Socialism: What is
it?“ and showed considerable knowl-
edge of the subject. Clark cleared up
a inuclidiscu sed question by speaking
on "Socialism distinguished irorn
D‘l'iltel‘ualisnl.” lie spoke ind, very
interesting and iluent manner.

The program “as closed with Euler
hate on, It’cmlltd: That Socialism or-
Iersthc best solution of present day
eVlli The alllrinntive was upheld
by Lincoln and .T, A. Wilson, while
Kensiriger and Iliener supported the
negative. Although the ailirrpative
won, special mention must. be made or
the work or both new mell, uhich was
exceptionally good

cni . ro.

Tire political program which was
given Wednesdc , night proved agrear
success. The society was divided into
iactions which supported and acclaime
ed their r-espectives candidates as
they look the lloor. J. E Nyllrlll ilrst
entertained the company with a well
prepared stump speech supporting the
principlesoi prohibition. L. D Hart-
son iollowed wrtlr a eulogy on Social»

ism. Music was given by Miss Engel-
brethen in the I'm-m of a piano solo,

Harold Lamb presented the lrrstory
oi the great ”American campaign
songs, old and new.” treating the su b-
,iect in an historical manner. The

NEW LITERARY ENTERPRISE.

Best S‘Oiies oiPast Volumes of Unit to be
Published in Book Form by Board.

Two years ago the hoard ol Editors
oi the hurt cancelled the idea of pill»
lislrirrg every nitli year abooki oise-
lectcdstoriesir-omthe magazine The
plan was thoroughly tallied over and
it was decided that it should be done,
but on account or var-ions delays the
book was not published. This year
the lloard has taken up the matter
and arrangements are being made to
have the iirst volume ready roi- sale
beiorc the Christmas holidays. Tire
methodoisule will be that adopted
l'orthe Junior Annual, bysubscription,
and the blanks will be ready for dis.
tribution in a iew days.

In attempting tocari-y out this plan
the lloard has several considerations
in \ ielv. Among the ﬁrst. is to collect
in compact; tom the best literary
ellor-ts oi the students during a given
period of tiine,and to put it iir such
a shape that it may be easily lrept and
relerred to, Thus the book will be in
large measure representative oI Stu»
dentliie and ideals as they are ex
pressed by the students themselves.
The ten stories which have been
selected cover a wide range oi student
thought and activity. The book will
be attractively printed and bound, in
size and shape convenient for a gilt
boolr or [ol'onc'soliu use and pleasure.
It will also bea nor-thy represelltw
tron oi the literary uoilr oi the stu—
denrs oi Iowa College during this
period,

Tire price oi the volume has been
placed at seventy—live cents per copy.
This is air exceptionally moderate cost,
but since the book is by the students
and for the students it has been judg.
ed wisest to make the price even less
than the value given in return. Furtli.
or notices will he made in a short
time, and an opportunity cliercd [0
