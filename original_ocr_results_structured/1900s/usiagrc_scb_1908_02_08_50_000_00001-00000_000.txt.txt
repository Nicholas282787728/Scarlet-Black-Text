Last night in the chapel, iliss Clu‘cr
line Sheldon prcscutcd a very inter-
esting talk on art windows or the
past and present. She, began with a
briel description oi the Gothic style
of architecture which by eliminating
the largo unbroken wall spaces and
substituting

between apertures ior light, made it

narrow stonc divisions

ation by the windows themselves since

Miss Sheldon next spoke oi the use
at color in window making, explaining
how stained and painted windows are
Ccnstructed. Colored slides oi rare
beauty were used with this part of
the t k.

in closing, Miss Sheldon sketched
the modem work in window making.
speaking of some of the artists who
are proving very succcsslul in the
Work, and brieﬂy describing the pro-
cess of actual window construction.

were worth ‘adlnirntion and

study. The west window is a line
modern Mosaic, the cast a painted Mo»
saic and the _aisle window is painted.
All of them have appropriate dignity
and simplicity and a duo glow or color
in which the greens and blues of the

modern school are most prominent.
