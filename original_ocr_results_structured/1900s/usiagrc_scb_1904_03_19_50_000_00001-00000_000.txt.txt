THE GLEE CLUB CONCERT.

The Great Event of the Season meets all
Expectations.vsuccessful Reception
Hold.

The Tenth Annual Concert ol
the Glee Club and Orchestra
which was given at the Congrega»
tional church last evening will go
upon record as one of the best
musical efforts yet attempted by
the local organizations As the
placards ﬁttingly put it, the Glee
Club was better than ever; and
certainly as much can be claimed
for the Quartette and Orchestra.
The attention of the audience was
held closely from the ﬁrst chords
of the ponderous Frithjof to the
highly emotional last moment in
the Alumnisonp when the "Old
and the New” dwelt lovingly for

the last time upon the verse—
"Come ye back,ye students loyal,

come ye back to old Grinnellr”
And "come back” the students
will if only the present standard
ismaintained, During the tenyears
in which the home concerts have
been offered to the public. they
have steadily grown in favor une
til they have become the social
occasion of the year when gradus
ate and student rally from tar
and near to via with one another
in honoring the scarlet and black.
Here the grad as it were, feels the
pulse of the college life, he exV
tilts in its strength as his strength.
and blushes for its shortcomings
as for his own.

The program as offered was
somewhat novelty. The
ﬁrst part was taken up with a pre-
sentation of Tegner's “Fritlij it
Saga." This is perhaps the heav-
iest production yet undertaken by
the G'ee Club and was creclrtably
rendered, although less appreciats
ed by the audience at large than
were the lighter parts at the pro-
gram which {allowed In the
leading parts Miss Katherine
Brayaslngebol'g and Mr. Olds
as Frithjof were beyond reproach,
and the accompaniments by Miss
Thompson were the teatur-c of the
number.

The program proper began
with a DeKoven number by the
orchestra. which, though marred
byaslight nervousness, won an
encore. A feature of this year's
concert is ilie evident fact that
the orchestra has gained a posis
tion in the popular tavor fully
equal to that enjoyed by the Glee
Club.

Mr. Condit's rendition of "Dore
i " with slrlliged accompaniment
was the most artistic number on

the program
