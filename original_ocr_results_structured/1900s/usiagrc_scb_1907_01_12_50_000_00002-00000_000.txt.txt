In spite of all calculations it is often
impossible to avoid a Conﬂict of dates
for diﬂerent college affairs. The
lecture course committee and the
managements of various other
college interests have been lustly
criticised for placing entertainments
on week nights and especially upon
Wednesday evenings which are sup»
posed to be given over to the literary
societies. Of course these troubles
cannotalways beiorseen or prevented.
Nothing can be done but make the
best of it. E’orlastnight two events
were scheduled but fortunately neither
wasto take an entire evening. By
careiul arrangement both were pro-
vided for withoutconiiict. The plan
of having the recital come ﬁrst and
the basket ball game second suited
very well and those who desired to
attend both are justiﬁed in feeling
that it was a mistake to change the
arrangement. It is to be hoped that
the students’ convenience will ﬁrst: be
considered when there is a choice to
be made and extra. effort put forth
that as nlany conﬂicts as possible may

be avoided.

At iirst glance it does not seem
lustiﬁable that a body of Students
should incur upon themselves as an
organization a money debt wllich
they alone are responsible for. It is
generally known that the Glee Club
did not receive enough to pay their
total expenses on their long trip but
it is not so generally known that the
management expecis to have Iitile
diiliculty in removing the incum'
brance. Itis Impossible to estimate
the Value or the Organization to the
college for so much of its inﬂuence
hears iron. in a way not to be ﬁgured
in dollars and Cents. Financially
there will be no embarrassment by
the end of the year and all the orher
income to the college which the trip
through the \‘Vest will produce is still
to Come in. This trip is only a start-
ing point or what will eventually
prove a valuable thing to the college.
The spreading of knowledge of and
respectand enthusiasm for our in.
stitution in a. country where it is
little known will be the result of the
club's efforts and is surely worthy or
them. It would be interesting to
know just how many students come
to Grinnell Whollyor partially through
the influence of the Glee Club. We
think the knowledge would show that
its elicits are worth whilst

the western cities is a worthy testi-
monial, then the ultimate Success or
the recent trip is assured. And since
the experiment has met with approv—
al it is possible that the club may un-
dertake more extensive plans in the
future. The {not that the Iowa Col-
lege glee club has met with Success
outside oiits home territory gives it
prestige airing with the clubs of larger
schools. if the larger colleges send
their glee clubs on extensive trips.
why cannot Iowa College?

Many receptions and dinners were
tendered the club by students and
alumni along the line. Grace Dough
lass Orr at Lincoln: our many alumni
at Kansas City: iriends oi Prof. Smith
at Atehisun; rleni-y Weber. ‘05, at
\‘illisca; Stella Doris. :07, at Corning
and the Slutz girls at Ottumwa all
entertained the club and helped make
the trip pleasant.

Three days were spent in Colorado
Springs. Two concerts were given
and the rest of the time spent in
mountain Climbing and Sight seeing.

On the last trip from iIcCook to
Denver the Conductor lost his hat and
Kibby his glasses While going between
cars.

Christmas day and night. the Club
was at Denver. Noconcerc was given
and 8. Christmas celebration was plan-
ned and carried out in the evening
A tree was set up in the car and pres-
ents given. Mrs. Douglass furnished
the candy and VVestlake acted the
part of Santa Claus.

The Cardinal quartette sang at a
wedding in Franklin and were treat-
ed to relreshments.

At Kansas City Dudley got lost in
the crowd and though periorming a
hali mile sprint inJess than 2:05 miss-
ed his train oy a hands breadth,
hisser nearly got,lost on the same
train but got back in time to enable
the i'illisca concert to be given.
though Dudley was still missing.
Peck played one or the violin solos

and Mrs. Douglass played the piano
accompaniments ior Lyman.

Slaght, as cook, did himsell proud
and established an everlasting reputa-
tion for himself by the way he tickled
the palates of the whole club. His
culinary ability made him popular
and his resourceiumess kept everyone
guessing though many attempts were
made to exhaust it. As a ﬁnal test,
which failed to embarrass the cook, a
iarewell spread was ehioyed Tuesday
night, Jan. 1 at Ottumwa. Througlla
out the trip Waters was Slaght’s able
assistant.
