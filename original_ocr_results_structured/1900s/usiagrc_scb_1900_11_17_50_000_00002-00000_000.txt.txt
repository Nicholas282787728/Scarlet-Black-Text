I-r scans well at this time to
call attention to the plan for the
‘sale of seats that the lecture com-
mittee is to inaugurate for the Y,
M. C. A. course this year. It is
very difﬁcult to devise a plan for
the selection of seats that will
work injustice to none—next to
impossible to make one to which
some one may not ﬁnd objections.
The plan that has been used dur-
ing the past few years has been a
very good one in many respects;
but many patrons ot the course,
particularly the ladies, have had
reason to feel that they tvere at a
disadvantage in the matter ot sea
curing seats, as compared with
the men or the college.

In order to secure a greater de~
gl'ec of justice to all parties, the
committee ltas hit upon the tale
lowing plan, which it would seem
ought to be effective, and which
will be ﬁrst used for next Friday's
lecture. Numbers for the choice
of seats may be drawn any time
from Tuesday morning to
Wednesday noon; but before any
person is allowed to draw a numr
her he must pay (either in cash
or advance course tickets) for all
the seats he wishes to secure on
that number, thereby giving as
surarice that the drawing is done
in good faith, and that all the
numbers drawn will be used. Re-
ceipts tor the tickets thus paid [or
will ot course ‘be given, and the
proper record will he made on the

list tit the place of sale. For the
actual selection 0[ seats, the coin—
nrittee will commence to call num-

bers at one o'clock Wednesday.

Persons failing to be prescnt when
their numbers are called will not
lose tlteirtrirns, but the committee
willselect for them the best seats
then available. Those wishingto
leave the matter of selection to
the committee may indicate when
they 'draw their numbers where
they would like to sit, and the
committee will do its best to se-

cure for them the seat desired.

The Olympian Games.

Mr. James E. Sullivan, present
secretary of the American Athlet-
ic Union,is authority torthe state
ment that the next international
athletic events will be held in the
United States. Mr. Sullivan was
in Paris when the negotiations
concerning the next international
‘nieet were in progress. Accordr
mg to the new union recently
formed, the Baron dc Courbcttn
has not, as formerly, the privilege
of saying where the next events
will take place. With the eXr
ecptioir of England, the
union will be thoroughly repre-
sentative of all countries that take
part in the Olympian games and
will have authority to decide upon
the place of meeting. Buffalo.
where the PaitrAmerican Exposi-
tion is to take place next year.
has sent in a bid for the honor of
holding the games next year and
will undoubtedly be selected by
the American Athletic Union.
There is nothing to prevent Cllls
cago holding the meet in [904,
provided the other delegates to
the international union will agree
to hold the games in this country
that year.‘ President Harper will
have to apply to the new union
tor this privilege. as it will be im-
possible to hold a successful meet

without the consent of that body.

Harvard has established a ﬁxed
system of pensions tor retired

new

 

professors of that institution.
