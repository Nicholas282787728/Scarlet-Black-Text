As was predicted in on. last N‘

To be sure our past experience is

Two noveltics on the program
call for special notice. The ﬁrst
isGiieg’ “llocl eilstagnui'l‘rold
llrlugcn.” (Wedding day at Troid
haugen), in I'yllil‘nlcandlial'mtlllr
ic material this composition re-
calls the popular Norwegian Biid.

 

‘al Procession. a Similarity which
is llOl to be wondered at, since
both pieces have the same gener-
ill theme and both are built on
characteristic Norwegian airs.
ll‘uldhzltlgen is Gricg'5 country
villa. .

'i‘lic otiicr novelty is the suite of
nniiqiic dances hy Eugen D'Al.
bcrt. D'Albert is more famous as
a pianist than as a composer, and
made a highly sticccsstiil Ameri-
can tour some ten years ago. The
suite was the ﬁrst extended instrur
mentalformtotaltedeﬁnitesllape,
and was the forerunner of the
sonata. It consisted of a group of
movements in the rhythms and
forms of different dances, cons
trasting with each other in cllarace
ter and ltcy, In later times the
suite broke away from the ciance
forms, and nowadays the term is
applied to a group of pieces tree
in regard to {dim and somewhat
less closely reiatcd than the moves
mentS of a s iata. The D'Albeit
suite, however, is written in the
ancient Style and consists or ﬁve
old dances. The allcmande is
characterized by “lich harmony,
earnestness of expression, and a
moderately ‘quick movement.”
The courallte is thus quaintly dee
scribed by an oldwritei “The pas
sion of teinper which is expressed
in the courante is that ol a sweet
hope,and we detect initsomething
hardy, ambitious, yet cheerful.
It tries to do honor to its name
by an incessant hustle and hurry.
but in such a way that tenderness
and grace are not absent." The
sarahnnde is ot Spanish origin.
Translerrcd to ltnly, it became a
stately, earliest and solemn dance;
“a measure tull ot ponip and an
clentry;" as Shakespeare cliarec
terizes it. The gavntte is oi
Flcncll oiipin and was originally
the dance of the Gavots, the ins
habitants of the town at Gap, in
the Alps. its expression is that
or “a right iuhilant joy.” The
niuselte is peculiar in that it has
thcsalnc bass notes throughout,
imitating the quaint monotony of
the bagpipc. The gigiie is the
most elaborate movement in the
suite, Iris lively in movement.
yer 5 construction is solid and
artistically developed.
