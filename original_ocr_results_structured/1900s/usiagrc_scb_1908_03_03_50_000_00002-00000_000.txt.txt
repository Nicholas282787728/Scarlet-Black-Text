Stuteniciit By the Secretary or the Col-
lcgc Council.

The college Council has been the
subject at more or less criticism be
cause it has not “done things.” it has
passed no rules or regulations tor the
College; it has not assumed the con-
trol oi athletics, or or any other coir
lege organization; therelore its critir
cizers conclude it is a useless body.

Perheps it would be timely to point
out a few facts in regard to the Col-
lege council and its tunctiens.

In the ﬁrst place. Iowa College's
methods of doing things must be un-
derstood. lowa College does not em—
ploy written rules and regulations.
The faculty and students ot lowa Cole
logo are not here to inalie and obey
rules, but are here ror mutual lielhr
fillness. it has been found that all
that is necessa y to make er p [ling
run smoothly is a guod understanding
between the faculty and the students.
This is the thing of prune importance.
The purposes ol‘ the iaculti and the
students
mums that they should ruin the best
means to work together, that is it ill".
tiiel understanding.

with this idea in mind, the college
council was created, in order that the
