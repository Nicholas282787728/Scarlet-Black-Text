The two concerts given by the Ora»
torio Society on Monrlayafrernoon and
evening June 12 were well up to the
standard oi former years, and (lesei'w
ing ciaiariarger audience than was
accorded them. The afternoon pro-
gram was In the nature oia tribute
to Mr. Herbert Miller, formerly of
Grinnell, who sangavery line group
orsongs with beautriul tone quality
and much dramatic appreciation. Mr.
Cowper‘s group was also very well
done and warmly applauded. Mr.
Cowper’s work is always iiiastci'iiilalirl
musicianly as evinced in his three
appearances of Sunday and Monday.
The Persian Garden was beautiful
as ever, and the quality of tone and
tone blending in the quartettes was
marvellously heautilnl.

The work of Miss Bray and Mrs.
IIeidel did not surier a particle by
comparison with that of the other
soloists. Grinneli owes a debt of
gratitude to them both which is im-
possible ever adequately to repay.

The “Swan and the Skylark" by
Goring-Thomas was remarkably well

atrocious order. The won: or the
chorus in the accompaniments of Mr.
Cowper’s and Mrs. HeiLlel's solos and
in the chorus ”Higher still and
liighei” was beyond criticism. One
could Wish for more volume in the
lrnal chorus ”0 thou art mighty,“
out the rendering or it was in no
other Way to be criticized. The work
or the soloists was so uniformly good
thatit would be unwise as unfair to
draw comparisons. Tire bass mono-
logue, the song or the dying Swan for
tenor, the alto interlude, and the
sopranosongoi' the Slrylarlr all.were
equally line and enroyable in entirely
different ways. Mr. E‘rampton's clean
out and beautiful accompaniments
added much to the musical Success of
the evening. The Oratorio Society is
