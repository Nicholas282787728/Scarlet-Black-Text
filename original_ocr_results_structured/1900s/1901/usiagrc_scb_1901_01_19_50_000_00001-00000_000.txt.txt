MusicrLitcrary Soclety.

A glance at the outline of work
for the Music-Literary society for
the present school year appended
to this article gives one some idea
of the earnest work done by the
“forgotten people on the third
floor."

Tlrrs society was organized in
the year ot’g7498 and was in a
large measure the achievement of
a long cherished purpose oi Mrs.
Cole's. The work was to be an
assistance to conservatory pupils
not only in their regular line oi
musical study,but also in opening
to them ﬁelds of research but
brieny touched upon in their daily
work, best exempliﬁed in the lit
erary ieatures oi their programs.
The society was launched with
abouttwelve charter membersand,
with the exception of last spring,
has carried on its work. uninter-
ruptcdly.

The ﬁrst year the member’s
turned their attention to German
Music; the second year to French
and Italian Music; the third year

 

to the Opera, and during the cur-
rent year they are studying the
Music oi the rgth Century.

The enrollment at present is
twenty-two members, its growth
attestingtothe appreciation ofthe
conservatorystndentsiorthebene
ﬁts delived from its meetings.
The society meets every VVeclneSr
day evening in Proi. Cole's room
inChicagoHall. Aitereaclrpapcr
some member of the faculty or-
student of the School of Music
gives an illustration of the work
commented upon, either vocal or
instrumental as the case may be.

It has the distinction of being
the only sociely in college in which
the students and faculty meet on
an equal rooting, The iunds oi
the society are used in procuring
standard musical publications,
both periodicals and books. Vis-
itors are welcomed at all of lhe
meetings. The work of the pres»
ent year is more enthusiastically
and faithfully carried otrt than that
of any previous year, and in its un»
obtrusive way, the organization is
developing a very beneﬁcial ﬁle»
partmcnt of musical and literary
work.

Drake’s Track Prospects.

Track talk is already occupying
the attention ot others than colr
loge students and trom recent re
ports in the papers we notice that
the prospect at Drake University
is not very brrght.

Chapman, \vho,it \villber'emcnl-
bered, broke the state record in
the pole vault last year, is captain
of the Drake team, Many of the
old men have left the university,
and competitors in the weights
and sprints seem to be very scarce.
She will have to devclope a great
deal of new material, according to
reports. and is even hampered in
this respect by a lack oi proper
training facrlilies. Her present
gymnasium ism the basement of
the science hall, and Grinnell stur
dents can sympathize with her for
this state ofaffairs. The construcr
tion of her new gymnasium will be
a happy event.

A Communication.

IowaCollcgc Alumni Association.
Ens, SCARLET AND BLACK:

In the SCARLET AND BLACK of
jan. 9th., 1901. I notice an article
entitled the Iowa Col/cg! Nu”:
Lﬂlli’, which impresses me as be
ing along the right line. The
writer says that the mission of the
ncw pnblication,“is to give inform-
ation to the Alumni and friendsof
the college who can be reached
in no other way." It is stated
that Prof. Maru is to collect the
news and also have charge oi the
publication. It seems to me that
