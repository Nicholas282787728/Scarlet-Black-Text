g1T cannot well be questioned,

that it the best results are
to be attained, an nistructor should
have the respect and conﬁdence
of his students. That this is not
true. oftentimes, in the case of
individual students, is by no means
proot that the iristuctoris at fault;
butltthe generalsentimentamong
the students of any instructor, is
one ct criticism. mingled with
more or less discontent, it is'at
least not unfair to the instinctor.
to question whether the students
are to blame.

It is equally trite that astudent,
in order to do good work, should
have the respect and conﬁdence
of hts itlstluctor, That this is not’
always true is, oftentimes, due to
the student himself; but that it is
always due to the student is by
no means true.

In either case the situation is
bad. But when both are true,~
the instructor lacks the respect
and conﬁdence of his students,
and the students fail to receive
the respect and conﬁdence ot
their instructor,7the situation is
immensely worse.

Owing to the scientiﬁc spirit
and other progressive inﬂuences,
it is seldom that am instance of
this Irintl occnis in institutions
like Iowa College. When one
docs appear, it is to be regretted
all the more. It would seem that
a condition of this lcind could not

long continue in an atmosphere
such as is found in this institution.

It would seem, also, thata little
largerappreciation otthestudents'
motives, than is sometimes shown,
might legitimately be expected
from their instructors. Thcgrcat
majority of the students are here
for a serious purpose, and are not
so apt to run away with the cot

are here to learn and need not he
forced to work. not ,treated like
rebellious children. At least the
Seniors, and those taking major
work should be credited with a
slight appreciation of their privi-
leges, and a willingness to do
conscientious work. Surely it is
notnecessary to make use of petty
punishments, such as are ﬁtted
tor grammar schools, even it a
student is one minute late at his
recitation. or fails to answer some
important question.

A feeling of spite should have
no place, either in the mind of
the instructor or the student.
Kindly helplulness and coropeiar
tion will accomplish much more.

the Senior class has pro-
ceeded to an early selection ot
commencement speakers and
committeesiscet'tainlycommend-
able. The experience of several
preceeding classes has shown a
tendency to defer most of this
important business until late in
the spring term,7ottcn with dis-
astrous results. It is evident that
the class at 1901 does not intend
to pursue any such procrastinatory
policy, Such an auspicious begin
ning presagcs well tor the success
at the ﬁrst Commencement otthe
