HE plans adopted by the
Ellis and the Music-Lit
erary societies might be proﬁtably
followed by the other societies of
the college. Deﬁnite courses ol
study have been prepared and will
be taken up in regular order. The
MusicrLiterary society, for in-
stance, has an elaborate course ol
study mapped out for the whole
year, and at the end of the year
their programs will have fairly
covered the ﬁeld of music, In
this way their work is carefully
systematized, and is given a unity
which could not be attained in any
other way. It is too often true in
our society node that the pro»
grams are arranged in a careless,
haphazard way, and without any
deﬁnite purpose in View, except to
take up the usual time at the socir
ety meeting. The natural result
is that the preparation of the pro-
gram isliablc to he made in a hap-
hazard way, and the society suf-
fers as a consequence. By the
adoption of some such plan as the
one mentioned above, these difﬁs
cultics could be removed and the
interest in the work of the socie-
ties be greatly intensiﬁed.

Dr. Herron's Future Plans,

It has always been the policy of
the SCARLET AND BLACK to give
only thoroughly authentic news.
A recent article inregard to Dr.
Herron was inaccurate, though at
the time the veriﬁcation seemed
to be reliable. It can now he
stated authoritatively that Di,
Herron has no connection what-
ever with the various educational
and colony schemes with which
he has been connected by many
newspapers.

For several years Mr. I. Stitt
Wilson, his brother, Benjamin F.
Wilson, and Mr. William H. Wise,
all otrlicni pastors ot prominent
churches in Indiana and Illinois,
have been living a communistic
life and leading a movement
called the “Social Crusade,” Dr.
l‘Ierron has taken this movement
and organized it into a social
apostolate, using these young men
as a nucleus around which to form
a devoted band of active workers
torsocialChristianity. Thcideaol
the apostolate (which retains the
name of the “Social Crusade") is
that it shall become to the social»
ist movement what the Francis-
cans uerc to middle age Europe.
or what the Lollards were to Eng,»
land. The members of the apes
tolate are to be sent out over the
country, following the plan of the
old circuit riders, to preach to the
Common people a social interpre
tation ot the teachings of Jesus.
Dr, Herron will begin the crusade
by a threesmonths’ course of Sun-
day afternoon lectures at Chicago.

It is said that Princeton Uni-
versity has a president who is not
a citizen of the United States, as
he was born in Beiuitlda and has
kept up his citizenship lllCH‘)"
