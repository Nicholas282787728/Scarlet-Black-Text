LTHOUGH the interests and
energies ottlre studentbody
are becoming deeply absorbed in
the all imporlant subject of track
athletics. nevertheless it is, per
haps, not entirely inoppol‘tune to
call attention to the debating
status ot Iowa College. As yet
our achievements in that line have
not crowned us with honor and

fame,as have our athletic victorie
In tact, our triumphs in the forelle
sic ﬁeld are rather more conspicu-
ous on account. of their absence
than for any other reason. Dur-
ing the past four year-s rve have
met an annual defeat at the hands
ofdebatersfromasisterinstitutlon
till they, apparently, have sought
a toe more worthy or their steel.
We do not know how to account
tor these successive triumphs ot
our opponentsand to explain that
part at the question is possibly
not necessary, but it would be
highly gratifying could some kind
seer suggest the source of our fail
ure. We cannot be content with
the answer that our representar
tives were of inferior ability. for
in that case we must admit one of
two alternatives, either that we
are unable to produce man of su—
perior ability, or else that we call-

not induce men of calibre to enter *v

into socrety work, It seems pret-
erable and more reasonable to ac-
cept the latter alternative as our

 

 

working hypothesis. And in sub
stantiation ot this conclusion, per.
mit us to state that one of the best
efforts of that nature we have
listened to lately was given by
a person not in society work.
From personal experience we can
say that three and tour years ago,
and possibly since. much of the
desirable material was not in 507
ciety work, or being tllele, did not
use their talents in the illieresi‘of
intercollegiate contests. The ex-
planation of this state of affairs
lies in a few words: “Lack of in-
celltive.” The person of superior
ability saw that his efforts would
bermore appreciated in the class
room, and there, at least. conscien-
tious and diligent labor would ob
tain its reward. We believe that
the students and taculty are too
prone to overlook the sacriﬁces
made and work done by those wllo
enter these contests, and too often
to minimize its importance. Lack
of general college interest and
sympathy in this kind ot work is,
perhaps,anotherelementthat must
be regarded as the source of this
absence ot incentive. It is, per-
haps. not too late to extend exe
pressions or good will to our rep~
resentatives in the annual VVash-
burn debate which is to be held

soon.

many peanuts as possible, in a

citement grew apace with the
game and the busy “spearers”
heaved a sigh ot regret when the
last progression was made.
