Last Game of the Season at Des Moines
Next Thursday.

Great Preparations Being Made for the Annual Struggle
Between Drake and GrinneIl---An Immense
Crowd Expected.

NEITHER SIDE CONFIDENT, AND IMPOSSIBLE TO PICK THE WINNER

on‘next Thursday atternoon,
the tootball teams representing
Iowa College and Drake Univer-
sity will line up for their ﬁfth an-
nual Thanksgivingrday contest at
Des Moines and thereby close one
of the most successful football
seasons in the history of Grinncll
athletics. There are ﬁeld days
and baseball games which in their
season have their partisan der
votees but atter all is said and
done the one event in the Iowa
athletic calendar which arouses
the greatest degree of interest
and enthusiasm in the hearts ot
both Drake and Grinnell support»
ers, and which appeals thestrongr
est to the friends ot athletic sport
in the Capital City is this annual
struggle when twentyrtwo canvas
clad lnights meet on the gridiron
to do battle for the honor ot the
scarlet and black and the blue
and white.

Nor is the present year any eXr
ception to this rule and much
speculation is rife this week
among Iowa College students as
to the possible outcome of our last
and in many respects mostimportr
ant game. At such a time it is ot
interest to glance over previous
records ot Grinnell-Drake strug.

essential 'in football as are beef

day 1898 after a most desperate
battle Iowa College lost by the
close score of 18 to 16.

In 1899 no game was played
owing to differences which arose
between thetwoschools. Thestory
of the season of 1900 is too fresh in
every mind to need repetition.

The question on every lip is
"What are our prospects?” At
present it is hard to say. This
much is certain; Grinnell will
have to do herbest. Stinging un-
der the humiliation of many cle-
teats every ~man on the Drake
team will go into that game with
a do-or~die spiritwhich isunknown
to "quitters." As for the local
team ”Gi'innell expects everyman
to do his duty.” And this is appli-
cable notalone to the members of
the team but to every boy and
girl in Iowa College. Let every
student that possibly can, cheer
for the scarlet and black through
thick and thin Thursday, for it
will mean yards ot ground in vic-
tory and a stubborn resistance in
defeat.

The Grinnell Institute and Cal-
ocagathian societies renewed ac-
quaintances again Friday night in
the society halls; and again cele-
brated the happy union which,ex-
ceptingthe years ’8‘! and '32, has

from their organization. This
time the function was a socialone,
all participants appearing in paper

which the entertainment was en-

twosongs; and thesamemembers
gave a select whistling number,

“Alumni

Mrs. Fannie L. Alvord, of the
class of '74, passed from the earth»
ly to the heavenly life, at her
home in Battle Creek. Mich., Oct.
3:), Igor.

Fannie Little was one of the
most gitted and popular young
women that has ever graduated
from our college, Vivacious, ver-
satile and attractive, her acquaint.
ances were all devoted friends.
She was ever ready to use her
time and talents for others, and
her many Grinnell friends will re-
member her years of service in
the Sunday-school as teacher and
organist.

A friend of her later years ren-
ders the following beautiful trib-
ute to her life and Christian char-
acter:

It is ﬁtting, whenit is written of
any lifeI “Itis ﬁnished," that com-
rades and friends of life's lighter
hours should make mention ofthe
one who has “passed beyond" and
speak to those bereft, such words
at sympathy as the language of
common sorrow may suggest.

A beautiful ‘life. begun forty-
eight years ago, in the heart ofa
noble and reﬁned tamily. has just
gone trom our midst.

Mrs. Fannie Little Alvord, who,
for nearly twenty years, has been
a resident of Battle Creek, passed
from this mortal life at “Evening
Time” October 30, Igor.

Agolden sunset is often more
heautful than the early dawning-—
so it was that Mrs. Alvord’s life
took on new graces and beauties
in the passing of the years.

Of many and rare gifts, of a
large and cultivated mind, she en.
deared herself, in a remarkable
degree, to those who lived near
her.

Her rare mind. her ready wit,
her kindly manner brought her
hosts of admirers, who mourn,
with us, that she is to go no more,
in and out among us.

Her place in the clubs which
she honored with her presence, in
the community of which she was
a large part. in the church she
loved and helped, can never be
ﬁlled.

mertime" when heaven bends
