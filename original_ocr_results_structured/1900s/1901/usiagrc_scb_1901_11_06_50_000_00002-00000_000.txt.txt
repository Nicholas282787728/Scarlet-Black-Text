@N Friday evening at the Con-
' gregarional church, the
students will have an opportunity,
at a low cost, to hear a violin re-
cital ot a very high standard.
Those who have heard Miss Fee,
speak other playing in the most
enthusiastic manner, and there
can be no doubt that a most der
lighttul evening is in store for
those attend her recital.
This entertainment is the ﬁrst of
a series of high grade recitals to
be given under theauspices otthe
school ot Music, providing the
students ot the college and the
people otGrinnellshow by their
presence Friday night, their de-
sire to have them continued.
The desirability of entertainments
of this kind for our student com<
munity cannot be questioned.
Norcan there be any question ot
the impossibility ot securing these
recitals, without the ﬁnancial sup.
port ot the students. This would
need no further comment were it
not for the lack of support which
has characterized similar events
during the last fetv.years. ScARr
LET AND BLAcK urges all to attend
the recital Friday evening, and
show their appreciation ot Mr.
Matlaek's effort to build up the
School of Music

W
WORD of caution will not
be out nt place, we believe.
with regard to our coming game
with Simpson. Let us remember
that the Simpson boys and their
triends are our guests, and apply
the golden rule. There is a leeling
among many of the students here,
that in our last game with Simp-
son, she was not treated altogether
fairly, and it may bethat a similar
feeling is still in the minds of our
Methodist friends. Fair and cor-
dial treatment ot our visitors
should be a dominant feature of
the game, both on the part of the
players and the rooters. There
is no occasion for anything but the
most pleasant relations between
the two schools and the opportunr
ity to manifest this spirit next
Friday should not be neglected.
QB]; wishto make one more ap—
peal to the students to turn
out en masse atthe Simpson game
next Friday. Too much emphasis
cannot be laid upon the need oi
organizedrooting. Thebeneﬁcial
results of this kind of support are
so manifest that they need no re-

statement at this time. In many
institutions permanent organiza-
tions of rooters are maintained.
and the work they do at their
athletic contests has proven very
efﬁcient. Inasmuch as we have
no permanent rooters’ club we
must do the next best thing and
organize temporary yelling
squads. With this purpose in
view, a‘mass meeting will be held
on Thursday afternoon at 4:15, in

earnestly urged to attend this
and help stir up some real enthu-
siasm for the team. Make your
plans to be there. and don't let
anything keep you away.

“A Lite tor a Life” brought out
a way in which this need tor God
could be satisﬁed. The talk ot
Sunday aiicrnoon laid the ems
phasis on lite. The thought was
that one’s lite may be the only
Bible some one. may have. A lite
should theretore be the "concrete
gospel,” the lile oi Christ himselt.

The tour talks given by Miss
Ruth l’axson were deCIdedly
practical and helpful to those who
heard them, The thought at the
ﬁrst meeting wasi“every human
heart needs God.” Education,
fashion, wealth. do not satisty
this want. Miss Paxson next
showed how this need could not
be satisﬁed by the “Hi try" or
the good resolution method but
rather by "I will."
