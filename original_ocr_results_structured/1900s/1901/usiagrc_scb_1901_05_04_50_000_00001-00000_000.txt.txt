Mrs, Berry Talks to the Men.

The announcement that Mrs.
Berry would speak at the Y. M.
c. A, meeting Thursday evening
was received with pleasure by the
men or the college, arid a large
number were present at that time.

Mrs. Berry's talk was an in
iormal one. but tull of interest to
her audience. After speaking of
some of the fundamental require
ments ot good society, such as
self control and generosity, she
used the rest of hertime in speak-
ing ot several important things
which affect our college lite in
various ways It was a very ins
teresting and helphil talk, which

the young men appreciated great-
ly.

Professor Nollen Writes his
Views.

Prof. Nollen, who is now in
Berlin, has written an article
which appeared in last Saturday's
issue of the Boston Irorrrm'pz,
which is causing considerable
comment. He discusses the
changes which are taking place in
Berlin,#changes which the Des
Moines Lard”, in its editorial on
the subject, calls the “Kaiseriza-
tion” of Berlin.

Prolessor Nollcn argues that
the rapid growth otBerlin is along
commercial and military lines,
while the educational and art in-
tercsts are being neglected. To
quote from his letter, "The spirit
or the times and ol‘the powers
that be' is evidently political. com—
mercial and industrial, rather than

 

intellectual and aesthetic".

 

Kansas Wins the Prize.

Robert Loufbourrow of Baker
University, Baker, Kansas, carried
off ﬁrst honors and a prize otcne‘
hundred dollars in the twenty-
eighlh annual contest of the Inter-
State Ol'atorical Association, at
the Auditorium in Des Moines,
Thursday night. His subject was
“The Orient and the Occident”.
William R. Davis of Ripon Col
lege, Ripon, Wis, won second
honors with his oration entitled
”Hamlet". Clark E. Cavenee of
Iowa Wesleyan University, Mt.
Pleasant was third. the subject of
his oration being “The True Res
publicanism”. Ten orators rep-
resenting respectively the states
of Kansas, Wisconsin. Iowa, Intlir
ana. Nebraska, Colorado, Ohio,
Illinois, Minnesota, and Missouri
contested for honols andit was
certainly no disgrace to be deteat-
ed in such acontest. The con-
test was a success from every
point or view. The greatest e‘n»
thusiasm prevailed and the hun-
dreds ot college students who
packed thc auditorium, made the
air ring with their choicest selec-
tions of college yells.

A reception was tendered the
delegates ot the convention at
parlors of the Kirkwood on Thurs
day afternoon and everythingpos-
sible was done to give the visitors
a pleasant impression of Des
Moines and her hospitality. At
the business meeting held at the
Kil'kwood the same afternoon,
Mr. Ewing of Knox College,
Galesburg, 111., was elected presi-
dent for the ensuing year. Mr.
MacKenzie of Hamline Universir
ty, St. Paul, Minn., was elected
vice-president, and Miss Minnie
E. Troop, ot Nebraska Wesleyan,
was elected secretary and News
urer. Since the contest goes with
the oFﬁce of vice-president, the
next one WillilJE held at Hamline
University, St, Paul, Minn.

May Luncheon.

The girls of the Y. W, C, A.
will serve a May Luncheon on the
campus May 14th, from ﬁve until
seven o’clock. The proceeds are
to be given to the Geneva tund.
It is thus hoped that more of the
girls will be able to go to Geneva
and bring back to the association
the ideas and helps which the
summer conlerence always gives.
Tile luncheon will be ﬁfteen cents.

 

Grinnell Lost Again.
'crinnell has again met deteat
on the diamond, this time at the
hands of the State Normal. The
score was s to 2 and it shows very
well the relative qualities of ball
put up by the two teams,

It was the same story that is be
coming so tamiliar to those who
have watched the career of the
team this year. Excellent ball was
played tor six innings and then
the Normalites batted out avic»
tory assisted very materially by a
few errors. This seems to be an
invariable program. The men
played listlessly and seemed to
lose heart as soon as they fell be-
hind a little. This is not charac-
teristic of Grinnell athletic teams
and should be remedied, Every
man must set his teeth and work
all the harder if a little bad luck
falls to his lot. It is this element
of grit that has won for Grinnell
in the past and there is even great-
er necd for this spirir now.

High School Home Meet Held

Yesterday.

Friday afternoon the athletes of
the Grinncll high school held a
ﬁeld contest at the fair grounds
tor the purpose of giving the men
a good “tryrout” before the ane
nual State High School Meet.
The “C” class challenged the re
mainder of the High School and
proved to be easy winners. No
surprising records were made,
which was due to the lack of com-
petition and also to the stiff wind.
The point winners ot the alter-
noon were Fuller, Keisel, Parks
and Myers. Fuller was an easy
winner in' the broad jump as also
in the lOO yard dash and high
jump, Kcisel won the runs, while
Parks took both of the bicycle
races and Myers the hurdles.
\Nlth the addition of Longshore,
who was unable to run because of
an injury which he sustained a tew
weeks ago. and who will add greats
1y to their strength in the clashes,

the High School will have a
Strong aggregation to represent
them in the state meet which will
be held here on Friday, May r7.

The student who retuses to sub-
scribe for his college paper and
their reads it overthe shoulders
of a fellow student, is short enough
to tie his shoe strings with his
necktieriEx,
