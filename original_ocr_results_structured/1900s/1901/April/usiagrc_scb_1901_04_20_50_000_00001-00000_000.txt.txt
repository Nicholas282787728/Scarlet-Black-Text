[owa College vs Washhurn
College.

Thursday evening, April 18,
Grinnell suffered honorable defeat
at Topeka in the ﬁrst of the two
debates which have been arranged
with Washburn College. The
great enthusiasm of the audience
and’the uncertainty as to the out-
come until altergtiie decision of
the judges showed how closely
contested the debate was.

Governor Stanley ot Kansas
presided and introduced the de-
bate with afeiv appropriate re-
marks. The question, "Resolved
that the permanent retention of
the Philippine Islands would be
detrimental to the United States,"
was ﬁrst taken up by Geo. L.
Seely ot washburn, Mr, Seely
maintained that permanent re.
tention meant either that the U.
S. must hold the islands as a ter-
ritory or must hold them as de-
pendencies. He took the stand
that the Philippines are worthless
and peopled withalow class ot
people and their retention would
pile up the difficulties of adminis»
tration and increase the problems
of the country, Secondly, to be
in harmony with the Declaration
of Independence we are in duty
bound to give the Philippines
their independence, Liberty at
home and despotism abroad will
never harmonize with our govern-
ment. Thirdly, our government
is not the right kind lorthe ruling
ot'colonies. We rnustgivc up our-
colonies or centralize our govern»
ment. .

Crosby for Grinnell next spoke
and outlined the burden of proof
which the afﬁrmative must sus-
tain, as follows: First. how we
can withdraw without greater
detriment than would result from

permanent retention, Second.
that we should now abandon our
position in the concert of nations
which the islands entitle us.
Thiid, that we can maintain our
trade in the east and the open
door in China it we should wirhr
draw. He also showed conclus
sively that the retention of the
islands would be beneﬁcial to the
Filipinos. to the people of the U.
S. and to the world.

Mr. Leach. the next speaker,
said the negative must show what
the U. S. would do with the Philips
pines it we keep them, and also
that the afﬁrmative will prove that
the policy of the U. S. should be
to hold them for a while and then
give them their independence.
This interpretation of the ques»
tion gave the affrmative a great
advantage, and enabled them to
ettectively evade the burden or
proot.

Mr, Dennison discussed the com-
mercial aspect oi the question and
showed by charts that the U. s. is
a great manufacturing nation and
needs an outlet for the goods. He
showed that we need a power in
the east to keep the open door
in China, using a large map to ex-
plain our position.

Mr, Anderson argued that the
commercial aspect otthe question
was relatively unimportant and
tried to show that trade did not
necessarily tollow the ﬂag.

Swan met the interpretation of
the afﬁrmative by saying that we
are talking or present day condi-
tions and that the tuture ot the
islands is‘already in the hands or
the American people and that
permanent retention reasonably
interpreted means indeﬁnite re»
tention. He also proved that
these possessions did not demand
a large standing army.

The afﬁrmative used direct and
forcible speeches and had an im»
mense amount of facts at com~
mand.

The negative used a large num-
ber pl charts very effectively, Mr.
Dennison being interrupted sever»
al times by applause as No rapidly
unrolled chart atter chart and ad-
vanced pointaftcr point unanswer-
ablc. The afﬁrmative was worst-
ed by the commercial argument
but had rather the best of it in the

 

moralargument. Thejudgescon-

 

sidered the moral aspect more ini-
portant and therefore decided iii
favor of the afﬁrmative. Crosby
spoke in his usual effective way
and Swan proved to be the best rev
butter upon the ﬂoor. The mem-
bers of the Grinncll team were al-
most equally efﬁcient speakers
and all deserve the greatest credit
for their efforts, The Washburn
students proved ﬁne entertainers
and nothing is to be regretted ex-
cept—our defeat,
THE SOUTHERN TRIP.

For the ﬁrst time in the history
of base ball at Iowa College, the
team was taken on an extended
Easter trip. Early in the spring

a series or six games had been ar-,

ranged by Manager Thompson
with the best college teams in
Missouri. Because of the ex-
pense of transportation only nine
men were taken. These are
enumerated belowin their batting
order. Fisk. s. 5., Capt.; Clark,
p; Schilling, 2b.; Wilcox, i b.:
Marsh, c.; Thompson, r. L; King,
3 b.: Fillmore, c. f.; Manatr, l, f.
Following is a brief MJ‘HMP of
the trip:

The series was begun Monday,
April 8, at Kirksville with a game
against the American School of
Osteopathy. Kingpitchedsteady
reliable ball for Grinnell but was
poorly supported. The
perience or most or the team was
evident throughout, Score: Grin-
nell, [3; A. S. O., 18.

Tuesday at Columbia the strong
team or the State University was
met and defeated by a decisive
Clark was in the box and
did excellent work. Marsh’s back
stop work and throwing to bases
was almost faultless. But for
two consecutive errors, a muffed
ﬂy and an overthrow to home
plate, the score would have been
i3—I. Three double plays were
executed by Grinnell. Score:
Grinnell, I3; M. S, U., 4.

Wednesday a second ame was
played with M. s. U. Fillmore
was batted hard while Grinnell’s
work with the stick was very poor.
Six ot Missouri's runs resulted
from two home run hits. Score:
Grinnell, 2; M. S. U., 8. ‘

An entire night on the road
lett Grinnell in bad shapoto meet
Central College at Fayette on

inex~

score.

 

_lOWA COLLEGE, GRlNNELL, IOWA, SATURDAY, APRIL 20, l90l,

Thursday. The men played list-
lessly and with freqhent errors.
Both King and Fillmore were
batted freely, Central College
had the advantage of knowing the
geography of the ﬁeld, This
knowledge was essential to good
ﬁelding. Score: Grinnell, l4;C.
C., 19.

Owing to the necessity of leav-
ing Fayette at 11:00 a. in. Friday,
the second game with Central
was declared on, '

Atter a day's rest the team
played in ﬁne form Saturday in
the ﬁnal game with A. s. 0.
Clark and Marsh again did good
battery work and in general were
well supported by the team.
Better batting and ﬁelding were
done by Grinnell than in any pre-
vious game. Wilcox's work at
ﬁrst was'especially good. Schil-
ling, as heretofore. played well
and consistently at 2nd. Score:
Grinnell. 25; A. S. 0., 6.

The scores all seem large but
they are characteristic of spring
base ball. In‘general the pur»
poses or the trip were secured.
The experience gained will be of
immense value to the team and
the trysout has shown just about
what may be expected ofthe men
in the way of individual playing,
It is hoped that the trip may be—
come an annual event of the
Easter vacation.
