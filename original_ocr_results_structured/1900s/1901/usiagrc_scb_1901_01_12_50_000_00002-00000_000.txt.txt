Attempts al; Wit.

\Vit- is the power of readily
combining objects in such a man»
ner as to create a pleasant sur-
prise.

In its place, and as a creator of
amusement, the use of a little wit
is highly pcrnrissrblc. But an at-
tempt at \vit which does not meet
the requirements is doubly obnox-
ious.

1n one'scollege course, one has
many occasions to come into Done
tact with some really humorous
and good natured features. Their
pleasant errects, however, last
only so long as the bounds at
propriety are not overstepped,
and as long as their occurrence is
not too frequent.

In the past year we have had a
few occasions to behold attempts
at wit, the latest being Cupid's
Herald, no doubt, it seemed grati-
tying to some, but did not meet
the sanction of the strrdent body.
These hand hills are mere spas»
modicoutbursrs,rvhich to the more
mature students become rather
stale.

The Museum.

At a very great expense Iowa

uncommonly well equipped mur
scum. All the departments of
natural history are represented,

Engravings ofthe Pan-American
Exposition.

The commrttee in charge oi the
FanrAmelican Exposition have a
very unique and instructive man»

They have some engravings of
