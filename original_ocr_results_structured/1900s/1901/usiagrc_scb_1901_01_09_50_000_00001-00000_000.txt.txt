Glee Club.

The glee club and orchestra
have decided not to give a series
of outiottown concerts during the
coming spring vacation. The mat
ter was ﬁnally settled at meetings
of the two organizations held dur-
ing the past week. A serious con
sideration or all things concerned
led to this decision, which, ale
though not in accord with the
custom or previous years, will be
readily understood by those lvho
have in any way been connected
with the two organizations in the
past.

Tire importance of the regular
spring trip cannot be overrestir
mated, for it has been a healthy
and eitective means or bringing
the college beiore the people or
the state. In order to make this
inﬂuence as widespread as possible
the management has endeavored
to cover drtterent territory irom
time to time, but the arrangement
of a suitable trip has become more
difﬁcult each season. This is due
primarily to the fact that the state
is being overrun with numerous
musical organizationsiboth good

 

and badiall being tor advertising
purposes. especially college glee
clubs. People in general do not
take the trouble to distinguish
between the two types and con-
sequently are rapidly losing all in-
tercst in both.

Tire ultimate success ot the glee
club and orchestra along this hnc
depends then eutllely upon a re
vival ot interest in general. and
the step they have taken is mere-
ly a temporary one towards the
accomplishment of this end. Fur
thermore, the northern and west
ern parts of the slate have been
visited on two successive occa-
sions, and in other directions ﬁnall-
cial considerations demand a more
extensive tlip than would be {case
lble this year.

Let it not be understood that
this action was taken because the
organizations are not up to their
usual standard. As a matter of
[act, the material in the glee club
is as good as cvcr and rs rapidly
developing under Prof, Olds' ef~
Flcicnt leadership; the orchestra
also is doing nluch better work,
comparatively, than other
years.

The home concert will be given
about the same time as usual, and
the efforts or both organizations
will now be directed exclusively
towards meeting the highest eXr
pectations of their Grinllell audi-
ence. A number of concerts will
also be given in neighboring towns

later in the season.

Preliminary Debate

The fact that arrangements for
the intercollegiate debate with
Washburn College. of Topeka‘
Kansas, are almost completed,
lends added interest to the inter-
socicty preliminary debate. It
had been the interltion to hold the
preliminary debate next Saturday
evening, but unavoidable circum~
stances make a' postponement for
one week necessary.

Tire question tor debate, chosen
late last spring, isas follows: “Re-
solved: That all exccutive duties
in our American cities should be
vested in tllc mayor and that his
appointments should not require
conﬁrmation.” The Institute up-
hold the arﬁrmative ot the ques-
tion and the Chrcstomathian socir
ety the negative. The men on

 

both teams have been hand at work
and as the question is a vital one,
we may be assured or an interest»
ing debate. Arrangements have
been made to secure separate
judgcs tor the selection at speak-
ers and the deciding or the ques-
tion. A fuller announcement of
the clcbatc will be givcn next week.

Iowa College News-Letter.

The Iowa College N’ws-Lz't/M
made its ﬁrst appearance during
the Christmas vacation. Its mis
sion is to give intor-mation to the
alumni and friends of the college
who can be reached in no other
way. At present it has no deﬁn-
ite date of publication, but wrll be
put torth whenever there are sufﬁ
cient items of interest to warrant
it. It contains general news or
the college and alumni, collected
from reliable sources and pub-
lished by Pro[. Main. No sub-
scription is charged for its circu»
lation. It at any time in the fu»
turc the demand is sufﬁcient and
the support given it is encourag-
ing enough, it rvill without doubt
have a ﬁxed form alld have a
stated time of publication, assum-
ing somewhat of the functions of
a bulletin. It will not be distrib-
uted among those who are direct-
ly in touch with the college,

Revolving Book Cases,

The college is indebted to the
generosity of the Senior class for
three handsome revolving book
cases for the library. These cases

larsappropriated bytlre class trom

Annual. Two ottlrcnrarealready

One otthc cases will be used ex»
clusively for the books temporari-

he may place the books which he
wishes to have retained for the use
of his classes, and such books will
not be allowed to go from the li-
brary. Another- case is being
used tor general rcterence \vorlts.
Dictionaries and lexicons which
