B‘nsltet Ball Prospects.

At the last meeting of the Athe
lctrc Union, dcr‘rnrte plans were
entered upon [or making bash-ct
hat: a pclmiuicnl icaturc oi lowa
Cullcgt sports. llitlrerto it has
cxrsretl as an isolated gamenntl
has received no systematic over
sight and support tronr rlrc Atlle
letic Union, such as lli\5 been uc~
corded baseball, tennis, track, ctc.
But from this time on, a regular
college team will be in organiza
tion, havmg a regular captarn and
manager, subject to rules governs
ing college spnlls, and r-cady to
issue and accept challenges tronr
neighboring teams.

Harris was elected temporary
captain and Digital] manager. No
plans have [materialized as yet. at
least not sufﬁciently so for public
cation. But games will certainly
bC played here in Grinnell with
visiting team, and against other
teams on their own grounds. In
the meantime, regular practice is
going on at the gym preparatory
to the games, wherever they arc
scheduled.

Another good tcaturc or basket
ball spirit is the class games, ar~
ranocmcnts and schedules nt
which appear in the locals. These
class games are the material
which produces the college team
and should be well patronized.
To turthcr encourage aspirants.
provision should be made [or con-
ditions tor Wearing a basketball
“G,"the supposition being that
some time basket ball will be a
state championship affair.

Grinncli has bcen slow in adopt-
ing the game. In the days of the
old gymnasium facilitiesweielaclt‘r

excellent opportunities, it is hoped
that this nlidewinter sport is fairly
cstabl“

Grinnell Library Bullding.
The city of Grinnell has res

ceived a gift which is as pleasing

to the college community as rt is
to the citizens. The Hon. joel
Stewart, a resident or the city,
proposes to erect a new building
to be used tor library purposes
only. The plans tor the building

 

have not as yet been deﬁnitely
decided upon, but it is safe to say
it \\‘lll be a one story blick builds
trig, with a library room and wilds
ing room, and when completed
\\'lll cost about Sr5,ooo, ltisto
be erected on the lot north of the
church on Broad street, This lot
was given to the city for this pure
pose by this Congregational
church, which organization had
been reserving it for its own future
needs. To give turther proctor
the goodwill Grinnell's citizens
hear her, Mr.
offered to duplicate any amount
of money which would be l'aised
among the busincss men for the
purchasing of new books. With
scarcely any error-t, pledges
amounting to Si,5oo were secured

and Mr. Spaulding at once pledg~ . . '

ed it like amount, placing $3,000

at tho disposal of the library for =

new books. This has since been
raised to about 53.500 and will
without doubt. pass that mark.

The unselﬁsh spirit manifested by
the donors is to be commended
and that their libcraliry is not unr
deserved is proven by the fact
that the Grinnell library has as
large a number oi books out as
many libraries have in cities much
larger.

(Continued lrotu First Page.)
“Poole’s”andthe "Cumulative” in»
dices and various other reference
books One side of this case has
been set apart tor new additions
to the library, so that those inter-
ested can keep posted in regard to
what rs being received. The tlrrrd

case will be used tor the century

Dictionary andtlrcEncyclopacdia
Britannica.

By meansot the newbook cases
it will be easier than formerly to
keep track of the reserved books.
and misunderstandings in regard
to them will be spared. Altos
gather, they ﬁll a long telt want,
add to the general appearance of
the library, and serve as an appro»
priatc memorial to the class ot
igol.
