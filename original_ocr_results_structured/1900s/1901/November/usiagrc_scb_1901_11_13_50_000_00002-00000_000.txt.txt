@biturinl

we more game ,—-—witllout
doubt the hardest games of
the seasoniremain on Grinnell‘s
schedule. The more important
one will be played with Iowa next
Saturday, when the question of
the state championship will be
decided. TheThanksgivinggame
with Drake, however. is.hardly
lessimportant. ltisthecommon
expectation thatboth these games
will be among the hardest and
most interesting games that have
been held in the state. We are
not prepared to make any state
ment as to the resttlts, except to
state ottr ﬁrm conviction, that in
both games the victory will he
won only by the ﬁercest kind of
playing, and that whatever the
scores may be. Grinnell will have
reason to be proud at her team.

vespcr meetings have good reason
{or self congratulation upon the
success of then undertaking. In.
terest in these services scents to
be incrcpsing-a rather noteuorty
condition of affairs for Grinnell.
Their success lies in the fact that
those who are responsible tor the
meeting. are making it worth
while (or the students to attend.
As long as this is tiue. intereston
the part of the students will con.
tinue; when it ceases to be true,
interest can nolonger be expected.
The only criticism that can be
made is concerning those who rec
veal the seemingly inevitable tens
dency to be late at the meetings.
The beauty ot the services is
greatly marred by the interrup-
tions of those who come late.
With only this service during the
afternoon, it is not too much to
expect all to be on time. if this
is impossible, it would be better

postpone their attendance at vcs-
pers until the next meeting.
HIE work of the scrcalled
Students’ Conference, is
proving so sueecsstul that it seems
quite possible that other depart
ments ot the college might ﬁnd
it proﬁtable to follow the example
that has been set. As is fairly
well understood, this conference
is composed of the professors and
students ot the major Classes in
the History, Sociology and Politi-
cal Science departments. The
primary object is to conduct a co
operative study of the current
articles relating to these subjects,
No hard and fast rule is establishr
ed. however, as is shown by the
arrangements that have been
made to have an address at their
next meeting by Mr. Wennertrunt,

of the Iowa Bureau of Labor
Statistics.
