State Championship Goes to Victor-"Odds in Favor of Iowa
but Victory for Grinnell Possible

SPECIAL TRAIN LEAVES GRINNELL AT NINE O’CLOCK

The eyes of football enthusiasts
all over the state are turned to the
Iowa~Grinnell game at Iowa City
next Saturday. Not since the
IowarGrinnell game of '99 has a
struggle between Iowa teams exr
cited so much interest. The tum-
ble Iowa has taken from her last
year's position and the unexpected
strength shown by Grinnell make
the outcome somewhat of a doubt-
ful proposition, with the odds a
triﬂe in favor of Iowa. Although
she has suffered defeat,it has been
from teams that rank among the
strongest in the west, while Grin-
nell’s games have been with teams
which do not ﬁgure at all in west-
ern championships,

The scores of the two teams in
their games of this season may be
glanced at, not with any idea of
making comparisons, but only as
interesting facts. Iowa hasplayed
6 games, winning 4 and losing 2;
she has scored 57 points to her
opponentsgd. Grinnell has played
7 games, winning 5 and tying i;
she has scored I35 points to her
opponents IO. Both teams have

IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL, IOWA WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER I3, IQOI.

WORK IN MEN'S GYMNASIUM
BEGUN,

Advanced Class Organized. Arrange-
men‘s Being Made for Ex‘hibition
by Iowa, Drake and Grin-
nell.

\Vith the coming of cold weather
the gymnasium season has begun.
The ﬁrst class was called to order
on Monday of last week. It was
director Davis's plan to have the
boys take exercise in the open
air as long as possible, but the
coldness has made such exercise
uncomfortable and has created a
preference for gymnasium work.

In the three classes which have
been organized there are about
one hundred and thirty boys.
Two of these classes are beginning
classes and take work adapted to
their needs.

The advanced class, composed
of men who have had experience
in gymnasium work. is a new de»
pariure, for heretofore all classes
were on the same basis and took
the same work, A new system
will be followed this year. A pros
gressive method of work will be
followed and the most proﬁcient
in each of the two lower classes
will be promoted to the advanced
class, The work of the advanced
class will consist of military drill
and calisthcnics, but most of the
work will be on the apparatus, on
which they hopeto develop: such
a high grade of skill and ﬁnish
that they may be able to present
a first class gymnasium exhibition
later in the year.

Director Davis has been carryr
ing on negotiations for some time
with the gymnasium directors of
Drake and Iowa for a triangular
gymnasium exhibition to be held
at Des Moines. These will prob
ably be carried through and the
meet will be held some time in
January.

This year the basket ball games
betiveen the various classes will
be played before Christmas, so as
to give full swing to the college
team who will be chosen from the
men who compose these teams.

The east basement of the gymr
uasiuin is being ﬁtted up for track
work which will be carried on dur
ing the winter underjack's supere
vision. The following schedule
has been arranged:

‘VARSITY SHOWING GOOD FORM.

Great Improvement Made sincethe Ames
GameiTeam-Work Specially Prom-
inent in Simpson Game,

The victories of the last tivo
weeks show that our team has been
making rapid progress in learning
the game since the ﬁrst of the
season, An immense improve-
ment in team-work has been made
so that Coach Knipe of Iowa ex~
pressed his surprise at Grinnell's
splendid interference in the Simp~
son game. Butbesidesthese points
the individuals on the team are
making great improvement.

Baggs, at center, plays a steady
and strong game. Both theguards,
Smith and Dunn, have improved
rapidly in knowledge of the game.
Dunn especially in the Simpson
game was quick to get into the
interference and help the runner
with the ball, and time and
again he or Goode broke through
and tackled Simpson's backs for
losses. Smith is still slow in run-
ning interference, but is doing bet-
tcr there, and is playing a ﬁerce
defensive game. Collins, at right
tackle, still has a tendency to play
offside, but is as sure a ground»
gainer as there is on the team.-
His work last night at right half
extraordinarily successful,
Marsh and Moore both play ﬁerce,
hard football though the latter is
sometimes a little slow on de-
fense.

Back of the line Captain Fisk
gets into every play better than
ever before and is playing perhaps
the best ball of any man on the
team. His generalship of the
team is simply remarkable and
had as much to do as did the
strength of the team in piling up
the large scores of the last two
games. Fisk's steadiness and
coolness do a great deal to inspire
the team with conﬁdence. Don
Evans has probably made more
improvement over last year than
any other man on the team and is
called on to carry the hall moer
often than any other man, He
still has a disposition to fumble in
the early part of a game. Evan
Evans is still liable to over-excite
menis but plays good football on
offence though he is not so strong
on defense. Lyman plays football

all the time and is a power to the
