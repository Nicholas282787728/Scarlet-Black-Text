Grinneii, Wednesday, November an, rpm

@hitumnl

UR deicat last Saturday is
sweetened by one veiy
consoling tact. The Grinneii spirit
has had a genuine ievival, and the
game at Iowa was an occasion tor
a further revelation of this inter-
esting fact. The cordial interest
shown by the students during the
entire season, the hearty enthusi-
asm which prompted three hun-
dred Grinneli people to accom»
paiiy the team to Iowa City. and
the spontaneous and eﬁcctive root-
ing ot our delegation, in the race
of deieat, substantiate the asserr
tion,madeatterthe Simpson game
and here repeated. that the Grio
nell spirit is a glorious living re
ality. The charges that Griniiell
had been relegated to the rctii iii
intercollegiate athletics, and that
the students no longer taie pride
in the success of the scarlet and
black, have been retuted and prov-
cn to be entirely without iounda~
tion, The support given the team
last Saturday was all that the
most exacting could demand, and
undoubtedly gate encouragement
to a team‘that was ﬁghting undei
very adverse conditions,

mm“! people seem to have

mistaken the purpose of
the new track at Ward Field. It
is not designed to he a driving
park, and should not be spoiled in
this careless way. The manager
of the track team, or ‘whoever has
the necessary authority should see
to it that the track is not used for
purposes of thin kind,

T would seem to us that the
time is ripe for a thorough
investigation of college athletics
with regard to professionalism.
and acomplete expulsion of the
objectionable elements, or else a
change in the regulations which
are causing the commotion and
uneasiness which prevail among
several of the leading colleges.
Iowa has already suffered, Mlnne
sota and Wisconsin seem pal‘ar
lyzed with tear. and now comes
the news that l-Inrvard is playing
several men of unclean records.
It is highly probable that other
institutions ot high standing might
be touched by a vigorous over-
hauling of their athletic affairs,
