The establishment of any insti»
tution on a ﬁrm basis demands
scrutiny of its weaknesses rather
than a complacent regard tor its
strong points. In this connection
sufﬁce it to say that the football
season at 1901 has been, from a
Grinnell viewpomt, eminently sate
isfactory. Manager. coach, train-
_er and team are to be cottgratu
iated on arecord successiui beyond
the dreams of the most optimistic.
Let us now look to the future and
our faults.

It is said that the past season
has witnessed a "genuine revival
of tiie old Grinnell spirit." For
this all should be grateful. It is,
however, an easy matter to sue
thuse over a Winning team. Isup-
pose, torinstance. that all Grin
nell was ltoarse the night of Nov.
8. Now,just how hoarse do you
think, kind "rooter." you would
have been had our friends from
Indianola gone home with the
long end oi the score? In shori,
isthe Grinncll spirit a creature of

vigor on steal? What we m
learn is, 3 fun that.a qti'i'ttcr'

cur after a defeat is just as con-
teinptible as ilie sprinter who
“drops his ﬂag" because beaten
at the start at a race.

We have made a (air start this
[all toward regaining sortie of our
former prestige. How can we im.
prove our position? I don’t pre—
tend to know all our needs but
here, in part at least. is the pro.
gram 1 should like to see carried
out:

First, a loyal student body. de-
termined to stand by our athletic
teams through thick and thin.

Second, a due nppreciation of
the tact that an athlete who turns
“qiiitter” is deserving of nothing
better than ristracism from the so
ciety of his fellow students.

Third. more encouragement tor
athletes of mediocre ability.

Finally, a lull attendance at all
athletic contests and a determina
tion to treat the visiting represen-
tatives at other colleges with gen-
erous courtesy.

express on the part of the team
their appreciation ol the hearty
and contintious support and co
operation given them this season
both by the faculty and students.

The manager, hythe closetouch
with the students necessitated
by his work, has had brought
belore him very vividly the spirit
that has animated them.

This year one could not but be
impressed by the purposetul spirit
that has governed Grinnell‘s root-
ers on all occasions. This augurs
well for the future. Let us hope
that this trait Will never be oul~
gruwn.

A word here may not be out of
place in iegard to the coaching
facilities necessary tor a success-

‘ful season.

The scantiiiess ol material wliic'

as ever been Griiinell’s fnrititici

in'alres'tbatl- the more imperative
that the position ol coach be

men we do have, receive the best
instruction possible. To insure
the best results from the team.
good coaching must be had to
supplement the good training now
provided. To obtain apocd coach,
a suitable salary must be quaran
teed. The expenses for this pur»
pose in an institution like ours
must practically be borne by the
Studﬁntrbody. Thus in this way
are the motors again indirectly
responsible for the success of the
season.
