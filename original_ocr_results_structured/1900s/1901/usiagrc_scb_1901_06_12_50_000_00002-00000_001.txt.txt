The Promenade.

A very pleasant evening was
enjoyed by those who attended
the promenade last evening, Part
of the campus south of Blair Hall
was lighted with Chinese lanterns
and seats placed here and there
gaye the scene a cozy and pleas-
' ant appearance. A large number
of people came out to enjoy the
music and the evening. The Glee
and Euterpe clubs in song after
song ﬁlled the air with music. The
evening was warm and balmy, the
stars were bright, and the glim~
mering lanterns and moving crowd
made a pleasing sight. As one
college song after another was
sungmthc air seemed to be ﬁlled
with patriotism for the college,
that all are to leave fora short
timeandsomeforever. Students,
friends and alumni thronged the
place and made up a typical Iowa
College gathering. For an hour
and a halt the music gave pleasure
to all, and the crowd of people
that left the campus did so with
theirlove for Iowa College strong.
er than ever. This isa very ap-
propriate way of ending the col-

lege year. It gathers the students
and friends of the college, new
and old, into friendly assembly
and strengthens the unity and con-
tinuity of the college life.

Commencement Exercises.

The Stone church was prettily
decorated in scarlet and black for
the 53d commencement exercises
of lows College on Wednesday
morning, June 12.

l’romptly at 9:30 the exercises
were opcned by the Amphion Or»
chestra playing a Mazurka from
“Coppelia” by Delibes, to the mu-
sic of which the Senior class, 48
in number, marched in to their
places. ushered by Miss Helen
Millerd and Mr. Gerard Nollen,
members of the Junior class.

Rev. A. L. Frisbie of Des
Moines then asked for divine
blessing.

The audience was again favored
with a number by the orchestra,
rendering the quartet from “Rigo
letto” by Verdi. In the minds of
many was the realization that this
was the last time that organiza~
tion would be heard under the
direction of Prof. Cole. The or-
chestra retiring at the conclusion
of the piece, the members of the
board of trustees present in the
city and the faculty took their
places upon the platform,

Acting President Main then in-
troduced the commencement
speaker, the Dr. Emil G. Hirsch.
pastor of Sinai congregation in
Chicago. who spoke on “Culture
and Scholarship.”

The Rev. Mr. Hirsch proved
himself to be a man whom it was
well worth listening to, for he is a
man who has something to say
and who, in saying it, speaks di-
rectly to his hearers. His plea
was for education, ill defense of
the college, asserting that culs
ture was an essential ancl not an
incumbrance. In his words, “Cul-
ture is interest, not information;
attitude and not attainment." The
interest once awakened would at-
tain its own end. The need of
culture in every department of
life is imperative. Both the lim-
ited space and the nature of this
article forbid any attempt at sum-
marizing his most excellent ad-
dress. snrﬁce it to say that it was
one of the very best Grinncll was
ever favored with. l

Prof. Cole then.dclighted the
audience by playing a piece othis
own composition, “Marcia Col|e~
gensia,”

Hill Prize Contest.

The annual Hill Prize contest
has always elicited considerable
interest, and the contest this year
was no exception. The fact that
the donors of the prize havc gens
eronsly doubled the amounts was
an added incentive which tended
to bring out the best efforts of the
speakers.

It has often been remarked at
these contests that the speakers
show a remarkable familiarity with
their subjects. and in some cases
doubt has been expressed as to the
fairness of allowing speakers to
choose subjects which they have
studied especially during the year.
These objections, however, rest
upon a misconception of the real
purpose of the contests. As the
donors of the prize have repeat-
edly said. there is no such thing
aspurely cxtemporeaddress. The
ability to make such an address
depends upon the preparation and
study of the preceding years.
Natural ability, of course, is an
important factor; but even natural
ability becomes stilted without
proper cultivation and is often
outstripped by consistent applica-
tion. So it has been the aim of
the donors to make the Hill Prize
the consummation of the previous
year's work-the goal which the
Literary Society student should
strive to attain. The effort of the
speaker is not intended to be an
oration but a spontaneous expres-
sion of the results of previous
thought and study. That this re—
sult has been attained in a highly
satisfactory degree, everyone who
has heard any of these contests
must candidly admit. The Con»
test held Tuesday morning in the
Stone church was well attended
and well worth the appreciation
of the audience.

There were eight speakers in the
extempore contest, each society
having two representatives. Each
speaker chose his subject from a
list submitted three hours before
the time of the contest, In the
sightsinging contest there were
four contestants from the School
of Music, each having received the
music two hours beforehand.

Miss Annie Shiley, of the Ellis
Society, was the ﬁrst speaker, have
ing the subject “The Social Settle-
