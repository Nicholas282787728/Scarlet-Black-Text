51—”; statement was made from

the chapel platform some
time ago that the lecture course, as
arranged for this year, approaches
closely to an ideal course. Cerr
tain it is that if Mr. Taft’s enterr
tainment last Thursday night may
be taken as a type of the others,
Grinnell people have every reason
to be satisﬁed. It was a strong
opening numberiintcresting, enr
tertaining and instructive. It
showed conclusively that the
course is deserving of better sup-
port ihanitisnowreeeiving. The
course is an expensive one, and un-
less many more tickets can be sold,
the deiicitorlastyearwillbe much
increasedr Such a result ought
not to be permitted. The efforts
of the lecture course committee to
furnish us a course of the highest
quality should meet with greater
favor and a united attempt made
to bring the course through with

out a deﬁcit.

FACULTY RESOLUTION.

The following recommendation
which is of interest to students
was adopted by the faculty at
their meeting last Friday:

Recommended that a standing
committee be‘ appointed whose
duty it shall be to watch the work
of students engaged in intellectual
work outside of the class, such as
public debates, oratorical contests
and dramatic exhibitions and rcr
port to the faculty when the gen-
eml work of the student seems to
be suffering from their outside
engagements.

Recommended further, that to
all said engagements involving a
public appearance, the same prinr
cipal apply that is now applied to
the Junior Annual board: viz.
that students taking part in such
public contests or exhibitions
must maintain a grade of c or
above and must not take more
than ﬁfteen hours of work or work
in morethan four departrnentsoi
study. To avoid triction in en.
forcing this principle, the stand
ing committee bnextra classroom
work shall report to the faculty
the names ofall students entered
for said contests as soon as possi-
ble alter the assignments are
made, and to facilitate this it
shall be the duty of the ofﬁcers
otthe student organizations con-
cerned to furnish the committee
withthe names.

SPECIAL RATES OFFERED.

It has been the object of SCAR-
LET AND BLACK so far this year to
increase its local subscription list
and so bring ic in touch with a
largernumberoilhestudents. To
a limited extent they have done
so,butit has been only to :l limited
degree. and not to a degree which
will insure the paper a continued
growth and prosperity. Believing
that SCARLET AND BLACK can be
made a more potent factor in the
life of the college than it now is,
the management wish to make a
special rate for subscriptions for
the rest of the year. Beginning
with the ﬁrst issue after the Christ-
mas vacation, the subscription
price will be seventyrﬁve cents tor
theremainderofthe yeahsubscl'ipr
tions to be paid any time before
June I 1902 We believe thatthis
is an opportunity that no student
who is not a subscriber can afford
to let go by. Iiyou do not know
what your college paper is like,
you are presented with a splendid
opportunity to ﬁnd out. This is
not to be taken, however. asapplw
ing only to students, but the offer
will hold good for anyone who
may wisll to number SCARLET ma
BLACK among his list of peliodir

cals. l

ART LECTURES.

The disappointment felt at the
non-appearance of Mr. Taft at the
time set for his lecture was very
keen, but his appearance in Grin-
nell on last Thursday night, the
date given him by the buleau,
furnished a very pleasant experi-
ence to those who heard him in his
"Clay Talk.” Mr. Taft was an
nouncccl to give his lecture on

of Today," but came prepared to
give his “Clay Talk," the more axe
pensive lecture by ﬁfty dollars.
He pleased the audience from the
start and gave one of the most en
tertaining lectures ever presented
in Glinnell.

Just preceding Mn Tart's lec»
ture, Mr. Samuel Strauss. of the
Des Moines mm, spoke in the
college chapel on "American Art,
VA Hope or a Fear.” The lec~
ture was especially interesting and
instructive and held the closest air
tention of the audience,

The Orchestra will have 3 re-
hearsal Thursday evening at 7:00
o’clock.
