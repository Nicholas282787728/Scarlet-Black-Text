LECTURE COURSE TO BE PRE-
SENTED IN OPERA HOUSE.
Arrangements Finally completed

After a period of uncertainty,
duting which it seemed as if the
Stone church would again have to}
be called into requisition. it has
ﬁnally. been deﬁnitely decided‘
that the last tour niirnbc" of the
lecture course will be given at the
Colonial Theater. The ﬁrst
lecture will he held at the church
as the opera house will not be
ready for occupancy so early
as December totlr. The outcome
is pleasing to everyone as tlle new
building is so splendidly adapted
to all enterprises of a public
nature that it seemed regietable,
to say the least, to tliinlr that tlte
church might be called upon to
answer tor a purpose for which it
was never intended

new structure can not be secured

the need of hearty support trom
students and citizens is more itn»
perative than ever before. The
numbers comprising the course
this year are such that no one
need be in doubt concerning a
singic lecture or concert as to
whether it will be tvnrthy of at-
tending, or not, for they tire all of
the highest class procurablc. The
announcements, giving more tier
tailed information, will be ready
for distribution the latter part of
next week and the ticket sellers
will then begin an active canvass
ot students and townspeople.
The prices this year have been
placed as low as they possibly
could be with so expensive u

MISS REW’S RECITAL

The chapel st gc was beautitully
decorated with auliirnn lcrtvcs anti

The order or pieces was well ar»
ranged to bring out the contrast
or the lively and slow movements.
The ﬁrst number was a pitce winch

The Rubinstein sonata was pet'-

of the program. It IS sut‘ﬁcrcnt in
itself to show the versatility ol the
player.
