Address Before the Christian
Associations.

in accordance with a long-estabr
iished custom, Sunday eveningr was de-
voted to the address belore the Young
Men's and Young Women’s Christian
Associations of the college, The
meeting was held in the Congrega-
tional church and was presided over
by the newly elected presidents of the
associations, Mr. S. H Crosby and
Miss Cynthia Meyer.

After the opening exercises and a
beauiit'ully sung trio by Mrs. Vilttlln,
Mrst Heidci and Mr. Brande, Ml.
Crosby introduced the speaker of the
evening, Dr. Shaiier Matthews, Dean
of the Divinity School of the Univer-
sity of Chicago. Dr. Matthews chose
for his subject. “The Christian Scholar
in an Age of Transition," and without
any attempts at eloquence or oratori-
cal cii'ect, proceeded to discuss it in a
very clear and scholarly manner. His
remarks were based upon the ﬁfty
ﬁrst and fifty-Second verses of the
thirteenth chapter of Matthew, in
which Christ recognizes the function
of the educated man, and hints at the
things expected of the Christian schol»
ar. The use of facts is the great ca-
pacity which an education gives to a
man. Hence the christian scholar
rrrust be wise as well as learned. and
be able to distinguish between word
and fact.

In any age of tinnsition, like the
present, the great truths which have
been revealed in the past must be lec-
ognizeci and not discarded. Christ
used the past, and so must the chris-
tian scholar. Scholarship in itseli’is
conservative. but it is also progressive
its progress, however, must be a coil-
scrvaiive progress, and its conservar
tism a progressive conservatism. The
christian scholarhaspassion for action.
but in his action he is guided by the
past.

There are ihree great contributions
which the christian scholar can make
to an age like the present: The ﬁrst
is the maintenance of mor ai valuation.
in an age of transition, right is apt to
be judged by success, but life is more
than success and scholarship is more
than a trade. The cllristlan scholar
is the only one who can bring to the
world the right valuation of m dilly.
The second contribution of the chris-
tian scholar is the maintenance of mor-
al and intellectual honesty; and the
third is the maintenance of spiritual
valuation. Spirltauiily is the ability
to trace God in life. In the minds of
many law is supplaniing God, and
God is being wedged out of the world
by law. God is thus being deperson-
alized, and in the process all Spiritu-
lility is lost. To deper‘sonalize Coulis
to unclnistianize society. God is not
an abstraction; he is more than a mar
