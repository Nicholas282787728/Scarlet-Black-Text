CERTAIN class of students
in this institution are not doe
in; the square thing. They are
not behaving in the classroom and
showing the respect for tllcil ins
stl‘uctors which is to be cxpccled
from college and even academy
students. It is not a digniﬁed pro-
ceedure to invent and cxecutc
many little acts for the express
purpose ofdistulblng and prevent-
ing the class 'room work and of
making the lnstluctol' miserable.
Yetthis isthe exact thing which is
being doneby aC€I‘li\ll} clitss,whicll,
it is at least a pleasure to say, her
long to the acadcmyinol the eulr
loge. Students should realize
what they come here for; they
should have a purpose and at the
same time should exhibit some of
the home training which it is pre-
sumedtheyhnvereceivetl. Gentler
manly conduct embraces all that
is expected trom young men, and
that much we have a tight to cxr
pect. No argument will be pre
sented to support that statement,
for it is self evltlent and needs no
sup port 7 the old tlll'catlrbare
phrase "conduct becoming gentle-
men" will be omitted, Itis Cnougll

to say that upper clue-sullen consid-
cr some things as simply rude, and
are no: at all inclinctl tnjoin in the
laugh which sometimes follows
the recital eta fresh mis-tleecl.

Home Concert Seat Sale.

Notice of the seat sale for the
Glee Club and Orchestra conceit
appears in another column ot this
issllc. but an additional word of
explanation is perhaps necessary.
The plan adopted by the Y.M.C.
A. Lecture Course Committee has
been lountl vciy satisr’actury and
practically the same method will
be used on this occasion. Num-
bers for choice of seats may be
drawn at Alley's Pharmacy from
Tuesday noon until 12 o'clock
Wednesday noon. Tickets are to
be paid tor betore numbers can
be drawn. Receipts will be given
nut and these will entitle their
holders to thc proper number oi
reserved seat tickets at the reserv-
ed seat sale which begin. 1! l p
in, Wednesday. This plan may
reasonably be expected to letlilcc
to it minimum the llnlan'llcss ntltl

large seat sale.
