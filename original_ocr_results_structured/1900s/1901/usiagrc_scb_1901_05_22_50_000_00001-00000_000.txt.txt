The Senior Boys’
Entertalnsi

Saturday evening there suddene
1y appeared in our midst, like a
meteor, a senior boys‘ club last-
lng tor about three briet hours
and then as suddenly disappear-
ingr All year there has been a
growing sentiment among the
senior boys that the senior girls‘
club wasjust a little too exclusive,
and was appropriating too many
Saturday nights which otherwise
might be spent by more repre-
sentative class gatherings. This
brooding over their real or fancied
injury culminated last Saturday
evening in a senior boys' club
which during its brief existence
entertained young ladies picked
from every class in school except
the senior. Senior girls were ab.
solutely barred. The meeting
place of this club was at_tlte home
of Robert McIntosh where about
twentyrﬁve members and their
ladies gathered for a good time.

After the guests arrived pro-
gram cards were distributed to be
ﬁlled a partner tor each
event. The program consisted of
the games of wishes and stabbing
peanuts ﬁrst. alter which the umn~

pany was iavnrrd with a well apr
preciated violin solo by Mr. Parks.
Following this came the event
of the evening, strolling and re-
freshments. While half the come
pany was being served the other
half spent the time in strolling in

 

the large yard lighted by Japanese
lanterns or in the immediate vicin-
ity of the club house. Asa ﬁtting
climax to the events of this club
formed tor purely social purposes.
the company indulged in the old.
classic Virginia Reel. With this
the club disbanded and nothing is
now left of that meteoric appari-‘
tion but pleasant memories.

Chances al: the State Meet

The coming State Meet will
probably be the closest held for
years. First place seems to lie
among Iowa, Drake and Grinnell.
Neither school is certain of win»
ning for the smaller schools may
spring surprises at any time and
disturb the most careful calcula-
tions. Yet a pretty close summary
of winners maybe made now. Res
cent meets have shown that
Conger of Grinnell will probably
win the too with Peck OfAmes
second and Wolfe of State Nor-
trial or Coye or Salisbury of Iowa
third Wolfe isan unknown quanr
ity but is said to be speedy. The
220 lies between Peck of Ames
and Lyman and Conger of Grin-
nell with Wolfe of State Normal
or Arthur of Drake as possible
point winners. The quarter will
probably go to llrown oflotva.
though he is not showing up as
well as usual this year. The other
places will go to Tenncr of Antes.
Kies of Drake or Lyman of Grill-
nell. Brown alSo has the best
chance at the halt mile with Em-
erson and Jaggard of Drake pltsh~
ing him hard. C. C. Smith of
Simpson may come in for points
in the half, In the mile the chancs
es tavor Emerson of Drake with
Coates of Ames a close second
and Brdclcctt of Iowa third, The
weights will probably be divided,
the discus gotng to Gridley, the
Amcs giant, the shot to Warner
oflowa and the hammer to Pell
of Drake.

Drake’s chances are the brigltlr
est in all the jumps though the
the State Normal has a high jump-
er who may push Graham, tvltile
Raynor of Cornell and hair of
Grinnell will come cloSe to Sela
lards ill the Dl’Othl. Graham in the
hop stop and Chapman in the pole
vault seem to have a sure thing,
though no one knows yet how
high King of Grinnell can vault,

 

O

The bikes will go to \Vclln'el of
Grinuell if nothing unexpected
happens, while Porter ot Antes.
Annesburg of Drake, Clients of
Iowa and Firsel of Cornell will
ﬁght for the other points, Chnater
being the favorite for second,
The hurdles are conceded
Crouch of Grinnell with Lamb of
Amen a probable second and
Chapman of Drake and Call and
Anderson of Iowa coming in for
points. The relay race is doubt-
ful, Grinnell tvon it in the Triangu-
lar meet May H, but was declar»
ed to have fouled and the race giv—
en to Ames. Iowa claims the relay
but will have to run under state
record time to get it. Antes also
may come in to bid for first place
in the relay. Surprises will of
course come. No one knows
anythingcertainconcerning Wolfe
the State Normal sprinter, or
Read the Simpson ltammerthrowr
er, or Smith, Simpson’s half mile
runner. The meet will probably
be undecided till the last two or
three events. Chances for ﬁrst
are slightly in favor of Drake
though they are absolutely uncere
tain. The records made in most
of the events Will'probably be
good it the weather l3 favorable.
Almost all of last year's records
will be improved upon and it is
believed that the state records in
all three weights will be broken.
Besides this. a new record will be
made in the mile bicycle, and the
relay record will probably be low-
ered. *

Everything contributed to the
success of the affair. The day
was an ideal one tor picturing,
Dante Nature had on her best atr
tire, and not even the command
of the “powers that be" that the
crowd must be home by ten
o’clock, could check the ﬂow of
inn and gaiety. All‘lved at the

Seniors Get Week Off.

The Seniors ot the present year
seemed to feel compelled to follow
the precedent set by Seniors or
former years in petitioning the
faculty for exemption from class
room work during the last week
of school. This was donemprob-
ably without a dissenting voice
from any member ofthe class, and
the faculty has granted the peti»
tion. Those who are secure grad»
uate then will have full play dur-
ing the last few days of the colle-
giate year for clearing up matters,
preparatory to a ﬁnal departure
and farewell to Grinnelli
