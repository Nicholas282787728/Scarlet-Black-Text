TO THE STAFF.

All members of the SCARLET
AND BLACK staff are asked to meet
in my room for a few moments at
8 o’clock next Monday night. It
is highly desirable that no mem-
‘ber shall absent himself, as impor-
tant affairs of next year will be
considered. NAT P. ELLIS.

l-lE presence of Dr. Emil G.
Hirsch here Commence»
mcnt day will be greatly apprecir
ated by Grlnnell people, The
disappointment at the inability of
Protessor Palmer to be hereat that
time was keenly felt. but the sub-
stitutioll of Dr. Hirsch insures an
able and interesting address.

T was with a great deal of re-
gret that we have noticed the
laclt of interest in tennis this year.
Last year the State Tennis Tour
nament was held oh the home
grounds and our team showed
up well. This same event was
held at Cornell last Thursday and
Friday and Iowa College was not
even represented. This branch
of athletics should not be neglect-
ed toril deserves a place along
with the others. The tennis en»
thusiasts of Iowa College this
year are about six in number and
it is only lately that they have
done any practicing. Last year
more than double that
her of men were doing hard work

numr

 

 

on the courts as Soon as spring
weather would permit. Surely
with the results attained ill this
line by Iowa College representa-
tives last year we have every rea-
son to be hopeful. It these men
will only keep up their practice
they will eventually receive just
compensation. Tennis is an en
tertaining, wholesome game, and
we see no reason why it should
not have its admircrs the same as
any other branch of athletics. Of
course it is too late now to do
much for tennis this year, but the
organization, which we are in-
iornlell has been inactive, should
meet and elect oFﬁcers for next
year who will put some enthusiasm
into the work. SCARLET AND
BLACK sincerely hopes that tennis
will be a permanent game in Iowa
College.

HE interest in the outcome
of the state meet manifest
ed by the citizens of Grinnell was
very noticeable. Old and young,
alike, were eager to read the bul-
letins, and the expressions oi sat-
isfaction at Grinnell’s victory were
as cordial and sincere as those
fromthestudentsthemselves. All
otwhich goes to strengthen the
already'cordlal relations between
the college and the town,

Armour Institute, with a fund
of 53,000,000, will probably go to
Chicago University within a short
time. This school has thirty-eight
professors and a thousand stu-
dents. During the past ﬁve years
the University of Chicago has ab-
sorbed or afﬁliated nineteen
schools, not includlng Armour Inr
stitute.7T/M Um‘mn'zy Cynic.

President Carter, of Williams
College, has Just handed in hisxes-
ignation to take effect next Sep-
tember, During his administl‘ac
tion of twenty—two years he has
been very successful in building
up the material resources of the
college. Over 31,000,000 ‘hilve
been added to the endowment.
The number of students has been
doubled, and the taculty increased
from ten to thirtyrtour.
