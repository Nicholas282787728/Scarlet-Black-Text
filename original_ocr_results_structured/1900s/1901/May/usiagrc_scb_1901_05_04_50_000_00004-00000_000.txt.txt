consented to permit those who
had paid so IittIc attention to the
published notices to begin, at. a
tlme so neat Commencement
what would be necessarily a Very
hni-iicd and inadequate prepara-
tion for stlch an occasion; and it
did not appear to be for the crcdit
of the college to hold a contcst
withonlytwospcnhcrs. Thconly
proper course seemed to be to
omit the Hydl: Pl'lZE Contest from
this ycnt's Commencement pro-
gramme.

While we deeply regret the
situation. our hope is that good
may come out of it for ill: cause
of oratory in Iowa College. It
the students interested in public
speaking will see that. at least six
irorn each class enter for the pre—
liminariesiif these will pay nt-
tention to tllepublislled announce-
ments. decide early in the year to
entel the contest, begin promptly
and prosecute diligently the pre-
paration of their oration5#\ve
may hope for a contest of which
we can be proud. ,The slack, dila-
tory, half-hearted action which
has prevailed in this matter could
result in nothing creditable; and
thcrc has been some justiﬁcation
tor the severe judgement
presscd by some wnnn friends oi
the college that it: would be better
to abolish the Hyde Plize Con~
test than to continue such ex-
llibltlons as those oi recent years.
