MARKS are now and then

heard from some members
of the Senior class to the effect
that they are not going to wear
the uniform gown during Come
merrcemerrt week adopted by the
majority of the class. SCARLET
AND BLACK has nothing to say
about the appropriateness or in»
appropriatenessot caps and gowns
but upon another point a protest
is raised. In every comrrrunity,
association and class there are air
ways and ever will be some people
who do not fall in line with the
will ot the majority just because
they themselves have a different
notion. The civilization of a body
ot people is probably marked by
the greater or smaller number
of these people, but they are
always present. The Senior class
seems to have them, Some will
not concur in the will of tile class
through sheer indifference, la
ness to put it truthfully; some will
not through pecuniary inability
and some through anhonest opin-
ion. Granting good arguments
for not supporting tllc cap and
gown, it is the duty of every
member so tar as possible to sup-
port the class, It is easy to bc in
constant opposition to the choice
of the majority and to live in isor
lation trom the customs ot good

people; in other words, “Ol'lle

ness” is a quality that needs llttlc
Cultivating. Brit to merge one's
self into the choice otthe majority
and become one of them ill union
and strength, requires the exercise
ct higher qualities. The appear--
ance of a few members on the
plattorm not unitormly gowllcd is
all eyesore to the spectators. It
the Senior class could be putdown
as harmonious and as working to
gether in this matter as well as
otllels. then it could intleed‘be
called an exceptional class. Sell-
lots are urged to forget the ' pets
ty selves ill a case of this kind and
become a true and real mclllber of

the class.

Why the Hyde Prlzc Contest is
omitted

The decision of the Faculty not
to‘llold the Hyde Prize Oratorical
Contest this year calls tor some
words ot explanation. The tacls
are as tollows; The preliminary
contests were announced early in
the year to take place on Wednes-
day, April 24. The date for tllc
orations to be ill the hands of the
English Department was set in
the same announcement for the
Saturday preceding. The ztnr
nouncenlenls were posted in two
conspicuous places; editorials in
SCARLET AND BLACK repeatedly
called attention to them; they
were repeatedly spoken of in the
Required English classes. On
Wednesday, April 24, two oralions
had been handed in by members
of the Flesllman class, and so far
as the Protessors or English lrncw,
no one else intended to enter.
No other orations appeared. No
one hard declared an lntention to
compete. Under thcsc Cil'Clll‘nr
stances it seemed to the Faculty
unwise to attempt to hold the
contest. Although some stu-
dents cxprcsscd their willingness,
“for the honor of the class,”to
enter, the prospect at that late
date for a satisfactory contest was
poor, It seemed unjust to all
