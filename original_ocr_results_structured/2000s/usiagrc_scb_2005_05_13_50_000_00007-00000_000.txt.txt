Bradley Iverson-Long's last
movie-reviewing hurrah

This week we bid farewell to our most esteemed movie
reviewer, who has had a review in every issue of the 5 Et B since
his first year. Good-bye Bradley, hello Spongebob Squarepants.

A Very Long Engagement (R)

In these ﬁnal days orcollcge,I ﬁnd niyseltlook-
ing back and asking important questions like,“VVhat
were the top ﬁve movies otrlie past five yeaisv’Diiks
ing it out with Y Tu Mia/mi 7hrll£~iin and Fm'fnzm
Hem/err is the lovely, Frenchy touiancc Arne/b.

No other movie shows how computers and special
effects can turn a cute story into magic.The combinar
tion orstar Audrey Taton's spritely smile and director
JeansPierre Jeunet's creative eye is transcendent.

Now they went and made a war movie.

A Vii-y Long Engngrnrent, like its predecessor, has
some lovely special effects and a central romance that
is either timeless or tired, depending your level or
cynicism and the amount of play you’re getting.

The story goes something like this: Mathilde
(Tatou) and Mancch (Gaspard Ulliel) have been in
love since they could walk.

Wait.acrually Mathilde has nbnm leg, so she can’t
walk so well. Still, she's hot, and Mancch is lucky.

Wait, actually Manech gets drafted into World
War L In the trenches at the Somme, he is court—
martialed and cast out ofthe trenches into the deadly
no man's land,

After the war, Mathilde knows that Maneeh
should be dead, but still believes he’s alive, so she goes
searching for him. Given her bum leg, it's a long, slow
search.

Flashes of Ame‘lie's cuteness and whimsy are
sprinkled in A Very Long Engage/IteirziMathilde
plays the tuba, which, like everything else she does, is
cute.To appease the NASCAR dads, though, there’s
also a hunch or gory war scenes. And then there's all
the ﬂashbacks and mystery about what happened to
Maneeh.

in case the previous paragraph didn’t make it ob-
vious, there’s a LOT going on int/i Vci y Long Engages
merit. Probably too much. The fantastic visuals left
my eyes reeling as the confusing plot did the same
to my head.

This film is part romance, part mystery. part anti-
war polemic and part tuba showcase. Jeunet,Tatoii oe
co should have dialed down/I Vei y Longciigagemrnr
a little ifthey wanted It to be as classic as Ami/is.

The Aviator (PG-13)

Do we ically need another movie about a rich
Hollywood ecccntiic who ﬂies airplanes and sleeps
with moVie stars,.only to be brought down by his in
net demons?Therc may not be other movies that ex-
actly fit that description, but The ﬂol‘aim’s plot reads
Like an amalgamation of movie clichés,

Just like drinking on Wednesday nights, The/111i-
mm‘ is wholly unnecessary yet highly enjoyable. From
the very first scene, in which a young Howard Hughes ,
is painstakingly bathed by his mother, an act that fore-
shadows his issues with cleaniness and abandonment,
I was captured by the beauty and skill haunted by dis
rector Martin Scorsese and much of the A-list cast.

The story is typical biopic, After the initial scene
from childhood, we see an orpliancdsandsallegrowed»
up Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) beginning direction
on hIs ﬁrst ﬁlm, Hell'rziinglr.

Over the course of170 minutes—it’s a lung study
bleak—Hughes has his shares of successes, not the
least ofwhich atejean Harlow (Gwen Srcfani), Kathe
erine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner
(Kate Beckinsale). It must be tough for actresses to
play actresses. Hughes also breaks an air speed record
and buys TWA airlines, but it all comes crumbling
down because drama is ieqiiired.

771: debtor is completely Hollywood—liigh~ﬂy-
ing, opulent, superﬁcial and totally insular. yet Holly»
wood is damn entertaining. Scorsese, best known for
his gritty New York ﬁlms like TIIXI Driwi' and Mum
Strum, perfectly shows ottHolIywood at the height of
the studio system with elegant premieres and happen—

movie fare Tor/roiaro will have you singing its praiSr
cs, but not contemplating its meaning

for channeling Hepburn, play along in the game.The

agenda that involves forcing homosexual propaganda
upon children, Ifyou want to preserve your carefully
guarded innocence, avoid this movie.There are mul-
tiple subliminal messages that not only insinuate that
Spongebob himseltis gay, but that you should engage
in homosexual behavior as well.
