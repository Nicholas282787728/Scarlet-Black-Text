Coming together against hate

 

Student targeted by
homophobic vandalism

EYAEBY RAPOPORT

When Anne” arrived back in Halnes at 2
a.m. Sanrrday, she groaned at the torn posters
around her floor. Another party that didn't get
cleaned, she thought. It was particularly upsek
ting when she saw that mess extended to her
room.

But as she got closer to her door, she has
ticed that much of the clutter on the floor were
things she had pinned to her bulletin board.
As she got closer she saw the word “DYKES”
written on either side orthe hallway. When she
arrived in front or her room, she saw a largely
illegible message on her white board with one
line that stood outi“Stop it dykesl"

“It hit me that it was directed at me," she
said. Anne had become the target of irate.

Saturday, after sleeping late, Anne reported
the event, after talking to her girlfriend. “I was
taking a deep breath before,” she said. “I knew
it was going to be a big issue and I needed to
digest it myself.”

This incident, which has sent shockwaves
across the Grinnell campus, culminated in
Thursday night's rally or over 400 members
of the college community, with students, start
and faculty all in attendance (See accompanye
ing story). Police and security will continue to
work together over the next week to find the
perpetrators, hut Annes own healing process
will take much longer.

Two years ago this week, four Grinnelllans left Mardi Gras in St. Loui tt 3
am. to drive through the night back to scliool.}ust outside oflowa City, the stu-
dent driving fell asleep at the wheel and the car rolled into a ditch, sending Liza
Colburn '09 and Yuki Goto (formerly ’08) through the car’s back window.

While the other students eventually recovered from the accident and returned
to school, Goto sustained traumatic brain injury, slipped into a twmweek coma.
underwent a temporal lohectorny and is still, two years later, in expensive rehah in
New York. Knowing his family’s insurance money is sapped after two years ofirr
tensive rehah, Goto‘s friends are now organizing a fundraiser, determined to help

Students, staff,
faculty rally

HY DAVID LOGAN

Justhefore 8 pm. on Thursday evening three
rallies left Norris, Rathje and Main Halls and
started toward the IRC. One group marched
through the south Campus loggia chanting
“Hey hey, ho ho, hate crimes have got to go"
as studcnts carried signs proclaiming “HATE
FREE"and “Spread butter not hate,"

With rhc chants reverberating down the
loggra other students heat drums, pots and
even trashcans. As the march filed out of the
loggia toward the pic, onlookers joined in and
the doublcsfile line stretched from the loggia’s
entrance to the train ttacks.The three marches
arrived together at the JRC for an open forum,
meeting in a cacophony ordrums and chants

The night’s forum and march were the to-
cal point ofa two-week-long slate of activities
responding to an incident or homophobic van»
dalism deemed "a bias-motivated incident" by
Director'of Campus Security Stephen Briscoe
(see accompauying story),

Before the march snidents met in lounges to
prepare for the night s events by making posters
and Signs and practicing chants for the march
Over 130 students gathered at Main Hall,
around 80 at Norris and 40 in Rathjc.

More than 400 students, faculty and staff
eventually packed into the room, with many
climbing onto the rear staircase and balcony,
in what vwrs almost certainly the room’s largest
crowd ever.

Goto get the therapy he needs to return to Grinnell,

Goto’s friends said that the ultunate goal of the rehab is to help him return to
Grinnell as a fullsnme student. “The goal ofthrs rehab program is basically to get
him up to the cognitive ability where he can come back to Grinnell," explained
Cohurn. “We're hoping to raise as much money for him as we can."

After a year ofrehab in his native japan, Goto's family secured him a spot at
the Rusk institute in New YorkAa top-of-tlic>linc (and top-dollar) traumatic
brain injury facility. One semester at the Rusk Institute costs $55,000, and Com
is currently working through his third semester there.

To help the family and Goto himself, Coburn, Emily Stewart '08, Ben Schrag-
er ’08 and Jelal Younes ’08, are planning an exhibition ofphotographs taken by
Goto during his time in rehab. The exhibition will be a fundraiser and Goto’s
friends hope raise 55,000 to 510,000.

“For people who knew vulci, it's just such a huge part of him. He is always
carrying a camera and always taking photos," said Cohurn.

During his tune at Grinnell, coto was an avid photographer. "He has a good
eye for taking pictures." said schrager. Goto captured his friends' daily lives and
artistic shots, especially of the horizon and train. Goro continued exploring his
passion even in rshah hy photographing scenes in New York and his hospitals.

Goto's photos are professionally printed and mounted and will be up for sale
at Giinnell coffee Company on March 8.1n the week leading up to the sale, the
friends also plan to sell tsshnts outside of the dining hall, Sehrager is hoping to
see the same outpouring ofsupport that Grinnellians made visible in the weeks
just after the accident. “There was a lot of pubhc displays of supporticounseling
sessions that ran way late and people writing notes,” said Schmger.

Motivation for the exhibition went beyond merely financial goals as Goto's
frrends wanted to show their continued support for him.Though it has been very
difficult mentally, physically and tinancially for Goto to recover his cognitive abil—
ity, Coburn says Goto has come to understand that “his friends are what really
matter."

Coburn and other Grinnellians remain in frequent contact with Goto and
