The lollowing is the innct voice given thought. Read ifyou will, but

of its people This ptefetence has often,‘ in the past (and hopefully will
continue to do so in the tutute) heen so heavily to

it's not just that I know Kant’s categotical impeiative. That in and of

now stand as a fasclnzting, hottitying testament to hteakdown. I cannot

The college would do this community a setvice by implementing a

this campus. New student otientation Week is an ideal time to talk to
students, evetyone is ttying to ﬁnd theit ditcction at the heginning of the
