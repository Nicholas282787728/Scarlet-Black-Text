SGA reform remains

SGA, cont. from p. I

sion would be made this year. However, to aid next year’s Joint
Board with the decision, a third document contains the points
of reform that everyone could agree on what drawn up and ap
proved.

Vice President-elect Michael Billups ’07 pointed out other
areas where he could continue to help bring about change. “The
biggest issue is reform," he said,but also ofgreat importance is
improving Judicial Council, pushing for further student wage
increases, and “carrying on the ﬁght, making the sure the (Us
irion increases are legitimate."

Anna McNulty ’06,
an SA on Norris third
who worked closely
with Hobbs, said that
no one on student staff
suspected theft. She said
that people knew Dobbs
could get students into
places it’ they needed to set up for events, but “no one pieced it
all together." McNulty said that the student staﬂ" reaction was

mixed and that the student staff meeting after the incident “was
very somber."

According to SGA Treasurer Matt Cleinman ’06, Dobbs'
receipts for the HSC study breaks aroused suspicions after her
arrest. Student Affairs requested all copies of the study break
receipts from accounting while SGA looked into the charges
made for the Fetish Harris Party. Cleinman turned over all the
receipts to accounting for investigation. According to Cleinr
man, Dobhs spent 3586.78 of her 3700 budget for the semest
ter but several charges “seemed off." Cleinman said that with
charges that seem “semi-plausible we give them the benetit
of the doubt” because “procedures to conﬁrm student staff pur-
chases were used for ﬂoor and hall events would he unwieldy."
After taking a closer look, it appeared that some of the charges
had been for personal use.

Syrian visit causes controversy

Ambassador spars with Gibel-Azoulay, Noga Ashkenazai ‘09 during Q&A

BY DAVID MONTGOMERY

The years schedule of Rosenfield speakers closed with fires
works.

Dozens of students and faculty—and one Grinnell police
ofﬁcer—gathered in the Forum South Lounge Monday eve-
ning for a presentation by the Syrian am-
bassador to the United States, Dr. Imad
Moustapha. The event, sponsored by the
Rosenﬁeld Program in Public Affairs, Inter-
national Relations and Human Righrs,began
with a half»hour presentation about the offr
cial Syrian position on Iraq, the Arab-Israeli
conﬂict and Lebanon.The question-and-an—
swer phase that followed featured a brief and
sharp exchange between Moustapha on the
one side and Noga Ashkenazi ’09 and Katya
Gibeerzoulay, Anthropology, on the other.

Ashkenazi, sitting in the first row of chairs, asked the ﬁrst
two questions to Moustapha. After he answered her ﬁrst about
the peace process with Israel by defending Syria’s commitment
to peace, she asked a second question about human rights vio—
lations against Kurds and women in Syria. When Mousrapha

dismissed part of the criticism as “thirdrrate propaganda," Ash-
kenazi interrupted him to reference an Amnesty International
report. . .

While Ashkenazi read from the report, Mousrapha turned
to Wayne Meyer, Political Science, who was moderating the
discussion. "She has interrupted me while
I was trying to answer her question. is this
permitted?" Moustapha said. After Moyer
told him to go ahead,Mousrapha resumed.
“Look, it’s very clear to me that you came
here not to discuss things with me but to
make my life miserable," he said. “You were
not successful."

Gibel—Aaoulay then stood up from the
audience and interrupted Moustapha in
turn. “This is not Syria, this is the United
States," she said. “When a student asks a
question, she is given the respect to ask the question fully and to
be answered rcspcctfully,"Moustapha and Gibeerzoulay then
both began talking simultaneously and loudly, with Moustapha
