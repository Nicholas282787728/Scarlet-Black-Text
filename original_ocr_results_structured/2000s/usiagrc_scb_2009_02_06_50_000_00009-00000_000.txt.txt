Changes on campus: alcohol task force and budget cuts

Reviewing alcohol policies

This past week the administration
announced the formation of the Task
Force on Alcohol Policies and Issues, a
body consisting ofsrudenrs and admin»
istrators charged with examining the
school's current alcohol policies.

The Task Force is mandated by
federal law but is also being conceived
in the midst of growing
concerns about alcohol
consumption on carnr
pus. We hope these con»
terms are addressed but
in a way that is trans .
pucnt and proportional, not excessively
i'enctional’y.

This year has seen a noticeable up-
tick in the number of alcohol-related
hospitalizations, which is certainly of
concern. However, Giinnell‘s alcohol
policies have kept students safe foi
years and we are confident enough in
the policy and the student body that
last semester represents a mere abcrr
ration and not an indictment of the
school’s entirt: policy

Compared tonianyschools,crinnell
is unique in its alcohol policy. Instead
of RAs at other instimtions patrolling
the halls on Saturday night. Grinneli's
SAs help introduce new students to re-

sponsiblc habits and are there as a sup
port instead ofa police when things go
too far.This approach meshes perfectly
wirh the school's cspouscd philosophy
of self-governance, in which students
take responsib ity for their own actions
rather than hi mg rules imposed upon
them.

There are many dangers nssoci»
ated with moving to a drier campus.

When first-years (e—
ccivc RLCs warning
them not to drink
in the hallways, they
may be too inclined to
pound too many shots
before going out, for fear of being an—
nblc to continue drinking elsewhere, If
rrndenrs are afraid of overly draconian
drinking rules, rather than calling the
RLC on call to hclp a sick friend, they
may mistakenly put them to bedwhen
they need help. While last semcster's
hospitalizations are obviously a prob
lem, they at the very least indicate that
students are unafraid of asking for help
when it is most needed and using the
system of selfrgovcrnance that is cur—
rently in place,

We hope that this commizrcc will
not suggest changes rhat impinge upon
the core principles of self-governance
that are central to our successful alcohol

stripping them ofresponsib w,

policy. To ensure that the Task Force
conducts its examination in line with
the tenets of self-governance it must
seriously incorporate student input in a
meaningful way. Students are not only
the ones most affected by these poli-
cics, they are the ones most knowledge-
able about the policies and their role in
campus life.

Committee members have already
suggested a renewed emphasis on edur
cation. lfthis is not accompanied by a
sharp change in policy or enforcement.
we drink diis is an admirable starting
point—educating students instead of
dictating to them helps them make
better decisions on their own terms, in
essential part of a liberal arts education
and selfrgovernnnce.

There are ways to keep Grinnell
students safe and responsi 6 without

For trustee consideration

With the current financial situa-
tion, it is reasonable that the school has
to reduce its budget for the upcoming
school year. While certain miscella—
ricous items can be out, items directly
related to the education of the students
must not be cut because Grinnell is,
first and foremost, a place for higher

learning.

There need to be enough qualified
professors in every department for stu-
dcnts to have the small-class liberal arts
experience that they were promised'l‘o
ensure all domestic students can com—
fortably complete their education, 100
percent neerlrbascd financial aid must
be met,

The administration has done a
good job of planning to increase the
ﬁnancial aid budget by 15 percent;
however, there is no gumntec that rhe
budget will be enough support for stu-
dents.The FAFSA computes the previ-
ous years income and earnings, but for
many families the ﬁnancial situation
has changed.

We can endure the current eco—
nomic conditions better than other CO1,
leges because even with a $400 million
dollar loss, the school continues [(7 have
a higher per-student endowment than
its peer institutions.

We ask the trustees to exercise fi-
nancial caution when approving the
budget because according to the college
mission statement: “The College exists
to provide a lively academic community
of students and teachers of high schol~
arly qualiﬁcations from diverse social
and cultural circumstances."

Consider possible outcomes of 100 days debauchery

Erin McBurney ‘09 waits in anticipation for one of the most talked about seniorronly traditions at Grinnell

comfort levels.

100 Days is quickly approaching, and 1 can’t stop
thinking and talking about this notorious tradition for
seniors. This Saturday, a majority ofthe class onOO9
will head downtown for pizza, drinks, and well
lots ofmaking out. From what I've heard from many
of my senior friends in the past three years, once you
get past the first few partners and the first few drinks,
it really stops being awkward.

But can kissing at this school turn from sexual are
traction and desire to a standardized sign of affection
and comfort with noirpartncrs? It scams that's been
the case in the past years at this event. If that's true,
I can't wait, I love kissing and 1 low: fricndsl I'm nor
sure ifI lovc kissing friends, though.

I've done it before and, well, combined with rhc
peppermint schnapps, I woke up with the strangest
feeling in my stomach. Straddling one ofmy best hud-
dies on my bed in cowles,I
knew that what I was doing
felt weird and wrong-*but
what's the difference between
making out with him behind
closed doors then and in the
bar oflimho's this weekend?
What I've decided about 10
Days, though, is that it's dif
fcrcnr from waking up and realizing you probably
made a mistake that shouldn't have been, This time
around, we all know exactly what we're getting into
and we all know to respect each others’ wishes and

When we're creating a safe space for affection, it
doesn't matter that those two haven't stopped mak-
ing out underneath that table for 15 minutes or that
you aren't on someone’s kiss list. What matters is that
these kisses can be meaningful and steeped in love or
just a reflection of purely superficial adoration of and
attraction to someoitc’s face or body,

Despite the fret that we all know we're probably

Maybe dangcr's the wrong word. Perhaps we're
just finally going to freely explore and qucstion and
chcrish each other within those brief, incbnnrcd four
hours. There's opportunity for growth and change,
not to mention new friendships and budding ro-
mances.

We’ve been building up to this moment fol seven
semesters, more or less, We’ve been together for so
long, We deserve to celcblfttc with each other, having

 

going to be making out with each
other with relatively little bag
gage the ncxt day, there's always
the danger of going past your or»
pcctations, and plenty of us have
nlrcady created and debated rules
about the night. I know plenty of straight friends
who don't know if they're comfortable making out
with those of their same gender. One
hasn't quite decided whether he's okay with
making out with guys. And what about
facial hair?

Should I make a concerted effort to
avoid kissing my best friends because it’ll
be weird, or should I go for it after assuring
it won't ruin our friendships? What if]
kiss someone and then decide, in the heat
of the moment, to take that person home? These are
moments that may make or break our sexual idcnr
tirics, boundaries, relationships, friendships, cx-ro-
mnnccs, and crushes.

made unique yet parallel jourr
ncys to our shared destiny on
May 18, I'm excited to show so
many ofniy classmates affection
and solidarity in a space where
love and excitement rcign.

And when 1 see you on Sunday afternoon in
A&M, both ofus drinking coffee and water smelling
faintly of bleach like it’s our lifeblood, I’m not uwkr
wardly going to try to be the same person I was when
Iwoke up on Saturday morning. I'll try to be better,
because I’ll have only 99 days left to know all I can
about you before we pack up to sum new and terrifyr
ing and exciting lives in all the corners of this earth,
Maybe we‘ll reach in through the hazy mists of the
night and our three years prior, pulling out strings of
memory and wcaving our stories together, and we can
laugh and cry and hug,

It's going to be so weird and it's going to be so fun,
like riding on rhc back of an elephant or wrestling in
spaghetti, and I can‘t wait to share it with you.
