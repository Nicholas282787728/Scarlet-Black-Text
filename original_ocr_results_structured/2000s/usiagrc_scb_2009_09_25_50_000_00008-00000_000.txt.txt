Many Grinnell College students wnh a shared passion for
art Aspirin, lsooctanc, Penicillin G, Polyethylene, Nylon no,
DNA, Progestin, DDT, Prozac and Buckyball and Carbon
Nanotubes are all making an unusual, artistic, appearance in
Faulconer Gallery

Molecules That Matter opens today in Fauleoner Gallery.
Brought to Grinnell from the Frances Young Tang Teaching
Museum at Skidmore College, this unique exhibition blends
seulptures, paintings, models and photos throughout the
space to tell the story of 10 molecules that changed the face
of the 20th century.

The exhibit follows a progression through the decades—
individual space is devoted to each compound, centered upon
giant models ofthe chemical makeup The rods and spheres of
the molecules are suriountled by related arrwoik.

MoiecnlesThat Matter is intended to reach across vaiious
subjects,

“You can say this about artyou can say this is about science
but it's also about ethics and it's also about social sciences and
history," Tilly Woodward, curator of Academic and Come
muniry outreach at Faulconcr. said.

Essentially, the show aims to achieve a balance between
what is aesthetic and what is Cthicﬂliﬂ difﬁcult line to tread.

One or the pieces, by Fred Tomasclli, is comprised of
13,000 Aspirin tablets glued to a back wood panel,

“I’d hate for people to go up to that and see just Aspirin
and think, ‘Oh, this is just about Aspirin and not necessarily
about human consumption or experience or interaction with
the world,” Andrew Kaufman, Art, said.

With this qualm in mind, Kaufman and Donna stack,
Art, will focus on bringing the inherently artistic nature or"
Molecules That Matter to the ﬂoor with their lecture on'Oct.
14: ArtThat Matters.

“I‘m able to privilege the art over the more scientiﬁc as»
pect," Stack said. “[The audience will be] able to walk away
and understand more clearly why a specific piecewas chosen."

“[The lecture] will reintroduce the idea of the content of
that piece. really looking at it
in a different way," Kaufman
said.

The show is intended to
celebrate art and science in an
interdisciplinary manner——
yet it is this combination of
art and science that has raised
questions.

“What’s the result of
juxtaposing these things to—
gether?" Kaufman said. The
answer may be, unfortunately,
less appreciation and examination of the actual art, in favor of
a focus upon the chemistry

“1 question if this is collaborative or interdisciplinary,
or if this is just a different way to get information across,"
Kaufman said.

The catalog produced by the Tang about Molecules That
Matter is entirely science-oriented. “All the images are just

with our exhibitions.”

sort of illustrative [of the science]...nothing in this text m,
ﬂects how this image is a collaboration.,.5o for us it was a
little disappointing and confusing, not having
that spelled out," Stack said.

Ironically, it was the collaboration between
science and art that brought the exhibition from
Skidmore to Grinnell.

“The primary reason is that it is an intensely
interdisciplinary show and we’ve been working to
find ways to reach out across the campus with our
exhibitions," Lesley Wright. the Director ofFaulr
coner Gallery, said.

In an effort to support the show’s interdiscir
plinary aims, Kaufman and Stack plan to examine
Molecules That Matter as an explicitly artistic ext
hibit."[We will be] trying to re-contextualizc the whole event
paying critical attention to how the show was generated...
how was it labeled and how should it be labeled and then try
to place these artworks outside of the show and reintroduce
some ofthe content that might not have been thought about,’
said Kaufman.

Faulconer Gallery shares this focus on the art in Mole-

Coun'mev Moon]:

eules That Matter. Woodward contacted Kaufman and Stack
to put together their lecture and the gallery has produced a
collection ofinformation about the art and artists.

“We've put together a big binder ofinformation about all
the artists in the show because the catalog is very thorough
about the molecule, but doesn’t show as much about the art,"
Wright said.

The actual design ofthe exhibition is also aimed at high
lighting the art. Milton severe, the exhibit designer, noticed
that in other installations of Molecules That Matter, the art
had been more in the background. ”The art sort of got lost,
seemed a little incidental," Severe said.

At Grinnell’s installation, he worked to avoid just that
phenomenon."One ofmy main considerations in laying it out
was to separate out the nonrartstuffin order to give the actual
works ofart space to breath,“

Fauleoner Gallery’s twist on Molecules That Matter
may be enough to engage viewers in the science and the art.
Enough, even, to solidify the balanced, interdisciplinary nae
ture orthe show. in many ways, the final judgment rests firmly
in the viewer’s hands. “[A]ll you need to do is come in and let
it be what it is," Severe said. “Just enjoy"

Professors share insights via films

BY Max CALENBERG

lryou've never watched a movie just be
cause someone smarter than you suggested
it, this weekend Could be your first screening.

The Better Know a Professor series be-
gins at Harris Cinema Wednesday, Sept. 30
at 7:30 pm. The program will start with a
discussion with David Harrison, French, and
then move to a showing of his chosen film,
Sherlock Jr.

originally released in 1924. and directed
by Buster Keaton, Sherlock Jr. is considered
a classic ofthe silent film era.

Keaton not only directs but also plays the
main character, Sherlock Jr., a projectionist
in a movie theater, who is bored with hisjob
and drifts offinto a dream which causes the
story to take a dramatic tum.

Harrison, in part, chose the film because
of its innovation.“lt's a great film in that it
shows techniques of cinema and ideas that

would later come out in films that we associ-
ate as classics," Harrison said.

Harrison also sees these techniques as
providing an excellent segue to discussion
because ofrhe pl ot s content

“Sherlock Jr. is really a film about ‘the
movies’," Harrison said. “so it's perfect to
talk about for film studies, or classic films."

Harrison first saw Sherlock Jr. during
his youth at a family friend's garage turned
homertheater. That garage pioved pivotal to
Harrison's development ofa love offilm.

"I saw a lot of [old 20s, 305 and 405]
films...in that garage,"l~larrison said.“it was
sort of my introduction to film history."

Teri Geller, English, began The Better
Know a Professor series last spring. The se-
ries is part of larger effort to build a cinema
culture on campus. In addition to teaching
ﬁlmenSCd classes, Geller also heads the
Cultural Films Committee.

Each segment of Better Know a Pro-
fessor looks to build a connection between
students and professors through film. Gellei
also wants to expose students to films they
may not encounter on their own.

“i want to bring a different type of films
to the study body," Geller said. “Films pcor
ple have never heard of."

The inspiration from the program, how-
ever, canic from a source very familiar to the
Grinnell College demographic.

“The idea was based on Stephen Colt
bert's ‘Bctter Know a District’ scries,“Geller
said.

Every semester the series will take on a
new theme, this first semester's is, fittingly,
“Classic Films."

“It doesn't have to be classic Hollywood,"
Geller said. "Although that's what people
tend to thing when they hear ‘classic films.”

The second showing in the series, Oct.

28, will be All About Eve, chosen by Astrid
Henry, Gender and Women Studies.

If not for the good cinema, or the engag—
ing conversation with a professor, students
maybe interested in the series for the simple
reason that the program was inspired by a
staple ofour generation.

“The idea was based on Stephen Col-
bert's ‘Bettei' Know a District' series, where
he sits down and talks to representatives
fiom different state," Geller said. “Instead
this is a representative from a different
[Grinnell College] department, so it brings
a very sort ofdepartmental look, but you also
get to know your professor better because we
all share this love ofcinema."

The series promises good cinema, inter-
esting discussion and professor access—all
in one sitting. Almost never before has the
Harlis cinema been so rewardingThcre may
even be free popcorn.
