It was the top of the seventh with two outs,
and the Pioneers were trailing rhe Kohawks 7'5.
but they had a man on boe, and cocaptain Matt
Teerers ’05, Iasryear's Pioneer-MVRwas at die plare.

Earlier in die day, in their ﬁrst game of dreir
doubleheadu against Coe, the Pioneers were
crushed 18-2. but Testers ensured that the second
game was more closely contested.

lrorner on thefirst pitch he saw
to rie the game at 7.7 and send
it ro extra innings,

“l was looking [0 hit some-
thing hard forsureand the ﬁrst
pitchlgorirasagood one,” said
Teeter-s. “I swung and it
dropped over rllclcﬁ-centcrﬁcld
fence. It's one ofthe best feel-
ings to know that you‘ve yust
picked up yorir team. To be
honest, I was thrilled. There’s
nothing more cxhllarallng in sports than ro hit a
horrre run, especially in that situation."

Teerers' effort was part of a fourrrun Pioneer
rally in the top oftlre 7th ,After a Pioneer ground
out ended dre inning, Grinnell hoped to hold coe
scoreless in the bottom of the seventh and move
the game-to extra innings. But the Kohawks scored
in the bottom ofthe 7th to pull out an 87 win.

The previous day, Grinnell dropped rwo games
to Moiriiioiirh, Iasr year’s MWC Division Sonrlr
Champion and MW: runncrtup. 1n dre hisrgmnie,
die Pioneers were leading 1-0 after me rlrird In-
ning, and were tied after ﬁve. But Monmouth role
lied in the bottom ofth: sixth, scoring four nlns to
rake the game 5.l. ln the second game, Monmouth
took a 3.0 lead in the ﬁrst inning and never looked
back. They shiir down Grinnell's offense, posting a
7-0 victory and holding the Pioneers to iust one

hit.

“were a little bit disappointed,” saidTeeters of
the team’s four losses this past weekend, “cspcclally
because of the way wed be playing up until this
weekend. but we're not by any means our ofth:
conference race."

CoachTIm Hollibaugh charaeteriaed his team’s
performanee an “subrpar compared to what we’ve
been doing,” noting that the Pioneer pitchers

struggled, walkmg too many
batters. Poor pitching is un<

: usual for the Pioneers; going

pointed, bui’. we're not
by any means out of

into this weekend’s games,
Grinnell pitchers had the low»
err earned rnn average in the
conference.

According to Hollibaugh,
the break from competition
this past week has allowed the
Pioneers to “get guys refocused
on the team goals and heal our
injuries." The Pioneers had
four starters in last weekend's game who weren't
100% healthy

The Pioneers have a chance to bounce bark
from their losses this Saturday at l pm. when rirey
hosra doubleheader against conference rival Knox.
During ihe. past two seasons, Knox has taken 52:}
ond place in the MWC South Division and
knocked Grinnell our ofthe playoffs, Knox has yet
to play a MWC gome, and with a sweep the Pie»
neers could get an early jump on the 6.12 Prairie
Fire in the conference race.

“Especially playing at home, 1 expect to sweep
two from Knox and the same from Central," said
Teeters. “They'rea team we usually play well aganst
at home, and hopefully our offense we’ll get going
sooner than it did last time. \Vc’rc nrore talented
than they are. it just comes down to a matter of
cxccution."

they frgnrc thcy’ll be just ﬁne.

“It takes us a while [0 warm up," said second baseman Lorraine
Gaynor ‘04. ”We played all those games in Florida and then had 10
days offWe did have a week ofpraetice bur ir inst rook us too long to
get going."

A year removed from its best season in school hixtory, Grinncll
softball has been hot and cold rhis season, losing
fonrofirs first five, winning four straight and, most
recently, dropping four conference marshes in a row
last weekend, All told. they’ve compiled a 5-8 overall
record (04 Midwaxt Conference) heading into thix
weekend’s Herec'l—oumamenr at home, where the
Pioneers will play two games each against William
Penn and Simpson College.

“This weekend’s tournament will be a real El'ml-
lenge," said head eoaehTom Sonniehsen. “Simpson
is almost always nationally ranked, and rs an lowa
Conference school, and Wlillam Pmn is a scholar»
ship NAIA promm. we have played each of them
in the past and we have won some and lost some.
Our chances ofsnocess are always rherc, bur a lot
depends on how we generate offcnsd l know we
will be nails on defense."

The Pioneers have developed a formidable defensive unit and are
giving rip only three runs per game, bur have been inconsistent of
fensively. Giiniiell scored inst three runs in four games during back»
to-back doubleheader losses to Knox and Lake Forest on the load
last weekend, and {JR Rionceix have already been shut our four times,
twice by tho Foresters.

“This years team is very solid defensively. brrr has yet to replace
the bar strength and speed ofa couple ofthe players who graduated

better.”

’We were a little rusty
coining off break, but
now we’ll be in good
shape for this week-
end and start hitting

you need to score runs to make that pitching effective 1 know that
we will improve as the season progresses."

Despite the lack ofoffense to dare, the Pioneers are still hopeful
about the upcoming weeks. This weekends tournament will mark
the team’s ﬁrst home action, and next weekend is the allimportant
Midwest Crossover Tournament in lancsviilc, Wis, where Grinnell
will meet all five members oftlre Midwest conference North Divi-
sion in aspan oftwo days.

“I feel excited forwliat we can still do," said
Gaynor “we had a rough weekend last week—
end. we lost all fonroforn- games and they were
all conference games, but it's still early and I
feel like we were a little rusty coming off the
break, but now we'll be in good shape for rhis
weekend and start hitting better."

“I hear that drey‘re tough competition, bur
if w: can get our bats going we’ll do well,"
backup pitcher and third bmeman Emily Kolbe
‘07 said. “Our defense has been pretty strong.
onr hitting is lacking, but I drink that'll come
around and we’ll be a tough team to beat ifwc
can get our bars going."
