Samuel Walker fills in the S&B on justice in America

Samuel Walker, a professor of Criminal Justice at
the University of Nebraska at Omaha, spoke about
“The Future ofJustice in America," on Nov. 9 in F07
rum South Lounge. Walker focused on the increase
in the number ofAmcricans being incarcerated, what
effect this has on America, and what we can do to
stop the “incarceration binge." His presentation was
part or’rhe Rosent‘rcld symposium on incarceration in
America. The sens caught up with Walker at Grins
nell House to ask him a few questions.

Q. Why tire dmiimtic indet’lse in t/Jz mimbcr affec—
pIa being inmrteraled?

As'l think that public attitudes have shifted since
the 1970s. There was just an increase in the fear of
crime.The response has been ‘we
want to lock more people upxi
think the public opinion data on
the death penalty shows this ladi—
cal shift from declining support
ot the death penalty It changed
around 196879 and suddenly
there’s more support.

Q. Do ycm arc paint opinion
[hanging anytime soon i’
A. There are straws in the
wind but it hasn’t coalesced into
a national movement. There’s ins
creased concern on the fairness of the death penalty
and increased concern about the cost ofincarceration
but it just hasn't become a political movement.

Q. W/mttm tl7£ impace aft/ii: imrcased rate cfi'n—
cartemtian?

A. I think in some neighborhoods, the really poor
minority neighborhoods, arrest and incarceration is
the norm. That's what happens, that's just what is
expected, That really shapes people’s attitudes about
their sense of society and what the opportunities are
and the lack of opportunities. it has a very dcvﬂsmts
ing street.

Q, Why [ml crime decreased in rcccatyom?
A, 1 think a strengthened economy is one reason.
There’s some very good evidence on the change in the

drug culture. There's a shirt away from crack, There
was a dramatic increase in violent crime starting in
the midrSOS when cra ‘rived. And it’s very much a
cultural thing. Cracki ‘ool, it's not the thing to do
anymore. That’s very true in New York and Washing
ton DC. and some other big cities. There have been
many studies attempting to investigate the deterrent
effect of imprisonment and the incapacitating effect
and none of them have shown a clear and consistent
impact.

Q. Why are ntnrefeu‘ﬁlz icing incarcerated colic"
Icrt crime: are icing mmmitted?
A. Well, imprisonment is driven by prrblic are
titudes.1 don't think public opinion has caught up
to the reality of the declining
crime rate There's a discon-
nect.

Q. Do yon/cal ilrc criminal
jritiite ryrrcm is racist 11ml ifrr,
[am can we change that?
AsThere's racialdlscrlmlnn-
riou all the way through and it
really has kind of a cumulative
effect'l‘herc’s some in the area
of arrests that is compounded
by prosecution that is come
pounded by conviction that is
compounded by sentencing itself. There‘s an attitude
all the way throughrThcre's race discrimination in ev-
ery aspect: education, housing. jobs, and in all the oil:
fcrent stages ofthe process. For example, the policing
for drug offensesThey put their enforcement efforts
into low income minority neighborhoods. There‘s
plenty or drug dealing in other neighborhoods, but
they don't put the same enforcement effort there,

Q What doyaii think aboutremcnciirggnideliner.?

A in principle, sentencing guidelines are very
good. We want to control the discretion, we don't
want to give judges unlimited authority to sentence.
We want to structure that and guide it, but you can
guide it like the federal government gaudes it in the
direction of more punishment, or you can go in the
direction of less imprisonment. I tend to think that’s

the more sensible approach. B th
Q. How do you roar/e the rat: vfllle warfl] oicaor Us Y e
cori 11m criminal justice tyrtcm ?

A, I don't really know because I haven‘t talked with
or read anything that indicated what their sense is,
It's very strong in terms orrhc death penalty because
Western Europe has gone completely away from it,
They must look at us in horror. I’m sure they’re just
mystified and horriﬁed, midszoog

Q. Haw bnlpnlr'ring roarigari?

A.l think their idea now is that we can't do it all
alonc.Wc depend upon people in the community and
so we actually have to talk to them. We need to estab»
lish good relations. The old model is were totally in
charge and we don't want your opinion. Shut up and
go away.'An attitude orthat sort is in its worst form in
LA. because it’s very militaristicTheres a new open-
ness to experimentation, theie’re a lot of experiments,
It‘s an exciting area. it's not clear how many or these
work but the fact that [they're] trying something, it’s
really just amazing One ofthe things I've learned in
the past ﬁve to six years is how drttererrt police de-
partments can be in terms ofthe culture and thc fittls
tudc.1 have an increasing sense otthis and have never
gotten to the bottom ofir,

Q. Do yaiifec] that the rig/m gained liming/a II]!
prisoners‘ri‘glm itinvenicilt/JM/e been trade/I?

A. one of the major gains was just in terms of
basic living conditions and how many prisoners are
in a cell of a given size. That has to do with privacy
and that has a huge impact on your personal feels
ings.Therc's all this lack ofprtvacy and that results in
conﬂict and violence. So providing space for people l
reduces violence and conflict. You’ve got too many
pcople.When you've got three to four people in a ceu
built {or two, there's a loss of privacy and a loss of
dignity. Cram any four people in a small space...ifyou
cram {our people in a dorm room built fol two, you’re
going to get the same kind ot’reaction. And here we‘re
talleing about people with histories ofviolence.
