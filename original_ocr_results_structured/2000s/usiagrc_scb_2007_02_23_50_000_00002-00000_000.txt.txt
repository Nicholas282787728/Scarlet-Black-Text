Americanelranian rela-
tions, strained since the 1979
lslamic Revolution of Ayatole
lah Khomeini, are quickly dere-
riorating and approaching armed
confrontation. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a
populist ruler and Holocaust denier, is accelerating his coun-
try's nuclear program. Yesterday, international Atomic Ener-
gy Agency reported that, in defiance of the United Nations,
Iran is much closer to acquiring nuclear weapons than pre-
viously thought. some American military officials contend
that Iran is encouraging autieAmerican hostility in Iraq.

There is debate over whether Iran’s apparent belligerency
stems from aims at regional hegemony Or trom genuine insee
curity in the face ofhostile parties.The Bush Administration
and others, seeming to believe the former motivation, are
adopting a less conciliatory stance. Despite iidministration
assurances against war preparations, its rhetoric has grown
increasingly hostile; two American aircraft carriers are cur
rently situated Offthe Iranian shoreline.

Those who believe Ahmridinejad‘s moves are an effort to
salvage his dwindling domestic popularity urge moderation.
An overly aggressive stance against the state would, they ar»
gue,prove counterproductive by further damaging America's
reputation in the Middle East and uniting the Iranian people
around the beleaguered president. Instead, they urge a more
conciliatory approach, like the negotiations that couvmced

Will Grinnell have a pom squad?

BY AMELIA Korono
Grinnell's up at the half
but it’s still close enough for
the game to be interesting for
the rowdy crowd. Suddenly,
the lights go down, music
booms, and eight girls come
out and dance pcrrectly. rcve
ting the crowd. That was the
image Veronique Porter ’08
and Gwen Carter '08 had.
Butilleeigl‘ltrwomanPon-i
Squad has not yet performed
at a game due to disagree
ments between squad mem-
bers and thc Athletic Departs
them about their routine.
Porter and Carter started
Pom Squad last semester.
“Veronique was joking around
about it," Carter said, “and I
said, ‘Ifyou really want to do
this, we can actually make it
real.”
Pom Squads routine is

choreographed to the song
“Give it Up" by Sean Paul and
Keyshia Cole. According to
Porter, the routine is about 80
percent dance and 20 percent
cheer. “There's no rump shake
ing, Nothing is really raun-
chy," she said. “it’s pretty ape
propriate.“

Carter described the style
ofthe squad, whose members
are mostly women of color:
“We take a lot from hip
hop... [and] we took a lot
from reggae music.”

The squad contacted the
Athletic Department, hoping
to organize their first perfor-
muncc at a halftime baskets
ball show. These interactions
included two meetings With
a committee of Athletic De
partment faculty and several
e-mail and phone exchanges
with Director of Athletics

Dee Faii'child and Director of
Intramural and Club Sports
Nikki McLellan.

Throughout these or
changes, the Athletic De-
partment members expressed
concerns about the routine
and suggested changes. Ac-
cording to Porter, the coaches
wcre consistently unclear
about the requirements and
constraints for the routine.
“We felt like they were giving
us answers hcrc,'and then they
would change it," said Porter.

But Fairchild said that the
department is not prohibiting
Pom Squad. “We want them
to do this, we want them to
succeed, we want them to
perform," she said.

The main problcrn, aCr
cording to Fairchild, was that
the squads moves were out of
sync. Sheworricd that the fans

would react negatively to the
squad, especially ifthe routine
had flaws. “I heard that they
wanted to make a statement,
but the best statement they’re
going to make is if they wow
the croivd,"she said.

Fairchild and the coaches
are also concerned that the
squad's selected music is not
appropriate to the venue and
that the routine is excessively
long. “We were confused
about what they thought a
pom squad does, because we
think a pom squad is en-
ergetic and enthusiastic," she
said. “We just thought the
music should be a little more
upbeat we wanted to keep
the emotions high."

On Jan. 26, Porter, Carter
and Tamrah Collins ’07 ten
quested that Jim Swartz,Dean
of the College, intervene in

North Korea to forestall its nuclear ambitions.

' “in general 1 think negoe
tiations tend to facilitate is—
sues in this manner in a bet-
ter way than force, especially
with nuclear weapons. With
nuclear weapons, you're not
just affecting leaders, you're
affecting populations.

“I think America has
,..battered its own name in
the Middle East and I'm
not going to say we deserve
the hostility...but we need
to clean up and we need to
start by taking less aggres-
sive actions."

mily Stewart ’08

~Compilcd by DavidLagml

“We’re a very aggressive
nation. I would urge not to
take too rash an action as we
are often prone to do.

“With North Korea, it
was [different because] it
was up in the air for a long
time and there wasn’t the
waremongering as like some
other areas in the Middle
East such as Afghanistan
and Iraq where we had plans
to go to war for a long time.

Sanrese also said he hopes that the town of Grinnell will
join in the efrcrt. A visually impaired person would likely have
ditficulry when approaching the crosswalks, which lack any
kind ofauditory signal that the light has changed.

Planet aflhc Blind, and Rosemarie Garland-Thomson, author

tors on Tuesday to point out features of the campus that might
trouble the visually impaired.

Yesterday, there was a display of assistive technology 7 tools
that can make college easier for disabled and non»disablcd stu-
dents alike.

Gotera, Krandel and Savarese are a few of many hoping
to get more students interested in disability issues at Grinnell.
“You’re involved with the issues that affect you, because you un-
derstand them,"l(randel said. She hopes that Disability Awarer
