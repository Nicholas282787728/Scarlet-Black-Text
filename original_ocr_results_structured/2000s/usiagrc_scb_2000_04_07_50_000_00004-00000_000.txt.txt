Book Review: Suicide Hill

By Joseph Michaels
Staff Columnist

I’d like ro srarr wirli a solemn oarh on my morher's grave that
this will be the lasr review 1 wrire about a James Ellroy novel,
Thar said, my morher isn’t dead yer, so I can swear all I want ro,
and rhere’s not a rhing anyone can do abour itl ofcourse, rherc
are rhe possible Cxceptions ofGod smiring me or rhe ediror nor
prinring myarricle/alrering my wording andvasrly changing whar
I say...Anyway, saicrde Hill is rhe final insrallmenr in Ellroy's
“uninrenrional rrilogy," and, quire frankly, rcads iusr like ir is an
episode in a serial. An extremely sub-pat episode.

Elltoy again uses Der. sgr. Lloyd Hopkins as his main chars
acrer, who is well revered among his peers but fairly universally
despises among his superiors. He has solved rwo major homicide
cases (the subjecr of rhe previous books in rhe rrilogy, Bland/m
ireMorm and Become the wig/re) and is now in rhe rhroes ofbee
coming a burnour. His adversary is a convicred car rhiefby rhe
name ofouane Rice and, I’m sorry, bur i just have an extremely
difficulr rime raking rhe name Duane seriously as rhe rirle ofa
supercriminal. Ofcourse, Duane (can’t you jusr hear rhc rwang
behind rhe harm?) is a fairly idioric person so ar leasr Ellroy is
nor asking ro suspend roo much disbelief While Duane was in
jail, ir seems his girlfriend, a rrarnpy, cokeeaddicmd wannabe
singer, ran offwiih one ofhis friends who could supply her wirh
coke and had “connecrions.” Theobvious rhing for Duane to do
when he is released is ro rrack her down and rry ro gcr her offrhe
coke (he's a sainrly fellow, he is), which he ofcoursc cannor do
wirhour some quick cash, and what's easier rhan robbing a bank
for quick cash?\X/ell, robbing ir when someone else already came
up wirh rhe plani Duane picks up rwo accomplices who “can be
rrusred <snickcr>" and goes ro work. The firsr nvo heisrs, rho
ones he srole rhe plans for, go off just abour like clockwork with

rhe cxceprion of one accomplice gerring a bir too...excitahlc
around women. ofcoursc, rhey don'r make nearly as much
money from rliesc hcisrs because Duane, criminal extraordinare,
failed ro complercly research his rargcrs. But Duane assures his
accomplices rhar everyrhing will be hunky.dory because he has
rhoughr up a bank.hcisr of his own. of course, he fails ro rell
rhem that his exeprison supervisor is now working as rhe head.
ofvsccuriryat rhis bank and rharhe inrends ro kill him. Details,
details! Third rime being me charm, and wharnor, rhey ger a
lor of money, but four people end ofdead and one just hap.
pens ro be me son ofa capiain on rhe force, who narurally
becomes consumed by vengeance. Everyrliing explodes inro
chaos here and tire problem is rhar rhesiruarion is wholly unin»
reresring. The main conflict simply was nor appealing in the
leasr and co make marrers worse, Ellroy racked on a final reso»
lurion ber ween Hopkins and me vengeancerdrivcn caprain
(who, coincidcnrally, hares Hopkins). The aurhor was aiming
for some sorr of supenresolurion rhar insread comes off as a
silly, humdrum sorr ofendlng. on rop ofall this, Ellroy com»
promises rhe inregriry of Hopkins’s characrer, which was one
orrhe major areas ofinrcresr in rhe previous novels in his tril»
ogy In sin-ride Hill, Hopkins is consigncd ro being fairly brut-
ish and his actions, which are supposed ro represent an unmr
lenring pcrsonaliry, come across as ovcrly dramaric and just gen—
erally excessive. The one parr ofrhe novel that does hold slighr
inreresr is whcn Hopkins attempts to reconcile with his cs—
rranged wife and children bur rliere is far roo lirrle ofrhis ro
mainrain any sorr ofintcrest.

SiiiridtHxll, when all is said and done, stands as rhe weak.
esr Ellroy novel i have yer read and is a poor ﬁnish to the “un.
inrenrional trilogy," Then again, rhar may be rhe problem;
wirh a lirrle foresighr and sharper planning rhis book could
have been an excellent coup.de-graee on an intentionaltrilogyr

BOOK REVIEW: John Irving’s ‘My Movie Business’

By Pat Rosette
Iowa S’roie Dolly (Iowa State U.)

(U—WRE) AMES, Iowa ilohn Irving's
new book, My Mai/1': Brooms explains rlie
difﬁculty in rransforming a book mm a
movie, Throughour rhe memoir, one can
sense the longevity and parienoe it took for
Irving to ﬁnally release the ﬁlm The Cid”
Home Rule:

The book dclivcrs a summary ofthe pro-
cess of Finding a producer, actors and a ser-
ring for CiderHoiaeRri/er, lrving also wrestled
with several versions of thc screenplay.

In the ﬁrst version,
rhe bleak one, Irving did
not want the movie
turned into a love story
because it is not what the
book is about

Though rhar would
draw some people away,
lrving wanred ro focus
more on Dr, Larch, Rose Rose and odter char-
acters. The first of four directors, Phillip
Borsos, liked the idea. Once he died, the
bleak version died with him.

Afrer Borsos’ dcarh, lrving needed an»
other promising direcror. Afrer a few days of
bickering wirh the second direeror, Wayne
Wang, lr was on to a third director.

Although rhe new direcror wanred rhe
movie fixed on a love triangle bcrwccn Wally,
Candy and Homer, lrving was less argumen-
rarive afrer rwo directors and several years of
struggles.

The disagreemenrs became more inrensc,
and Irving eventually discovered his fourrh
arrempr, Lcc Hallsrrom. Finally, ir was time
to start finding actors and actresses.

House Rules

“One can sense the lon-
gevity and patience it
took for Irving to ﬁnally
release the ﬁlm The Cider

// al istic ﬁlm from such

Alrhough. early on, both lrving and
Hallsrrom had wanred Paul Newman [0 play
rhe role ofor, Larch, Newman rejecred rhc
chance because of too many scenes by rhe
incinerator. Irving lalcl' found the wise. dra-
matic Dr. Larch in Michael Cainc.

since rhe movie was being altered so
much, lrving was nor serrling for inaccurate
characters as seen in the movies

Wirh rhe losr characrer developmenr in
convening the book ro a movie, lrving re»
duccs rhe importance ofsome ofrbe charac»
rers’ roles, bur srill rries ro keep rhe sroryline
focused on Dr. Larch and Homer.

Reading rhc
memoir proves rhe
movie took a tree
mendous amount of
time and effort in
order ro presenr a re»

a descriprive book.

For example, rhc

srory was supposcd ro rake place in rhe fall

when rho apples are ripening, bur afrer tak-

ing 13 years to finally premiere The Cider
Horirc’ Rain, lrving serrlcd for spring.

Along with rolling about hardships inThc
Cider Horne Ru/tr, lrving also emphasizes
orher books he has rried ro convert to mow
ies bur srill has not been able to do so, such
as The San rf/t Circus.

Two orher books of Irving's have been
transformed inio movies, 7/” unrudcrord.

rhough lrving had norhing to do wirh rhe

The main idea in wriring rhc book was
to explore rhc fickle narure ofrhc movie busts
