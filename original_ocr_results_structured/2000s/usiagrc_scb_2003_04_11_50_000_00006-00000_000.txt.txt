" for new custodial positions

Student
Initiative
#1

In the November campus
election, the following
initiative, sponsored by
Michael Andersen,
passed with 9d purranl
approval.

Because there are more
important things in life
than efficiency, the
student body urges
Facilities Management rd
maintain its traditional
practice of assigning each
residence hall to an
individual custodian rather
than moving the dorms to
a ”team-cleaning” system.
We also ask that the
college cease its year-old
policy of shifting these
jobs into a 4 AM»12:30 PM
shift. These new polities,
opposed by many
custodial stair, would
assign Custodians
undciimhlc hours, putting
especially unreasonable
demands on staff members
with young children. They
would furthermore
undermine Grinnell’s
unique dorm community
by interfering with
student-staff relationships
and removing both the
Students' and the staffs
sense of Shared
responsibility for the
places in which they live
and work.
