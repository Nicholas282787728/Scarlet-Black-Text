SGA on Initiatives

An article in last week’s issue of the SE97?
addressed the controversy over snidcnr initiar
lives, in particular the tnllying orthe “No Pref-
erence" vote. On behalf of SGA, I'd Like to
explain the process behind this decision and
how it will be handled in the future.

The purpose of a “No Preference" vote
is different from that of a “For" or “Against"
vote, rather it is an abstention from opinion
and should not be included in the ﬁnal tally.
However, the wording of the constitution re-
quires 2/3 of all votes cast to be “in favor” for
the initiative to succeed.

Since a “no preference" vote seems to in-
dicate the vot r has no opinion regarding
the speciﬁc in iative, and the Vote needs to
be counted according to the constitution, we
chose to includc it as a “For"votc as to not per
nalizc the initiative. Lastyear"No Preference"
votes were excluded from the necessary 2/3
tally; while this is the most appropriate way to
handle those votes, it also directly violates the
constitutionTo rectiﬁy this mistake, the SGA
Cabincr has proposcd a resolution that would
exclude “No Prcrorcnco"ror all purposes other
than reaching quorum. In addition, had rho
votes been tabulated in this fashion 12 of the
15 inirnitivos would have passed. We'd like to
thank the student body for engaging in this
dialogue in a constructive manner.

“No preference”

Last week's startling piece in the was
about election board's reinterpretation of the
“No Preference" option should concern ev-
eryone involved in the initiatives process. In
matters ofboth practicality and values, the rev
interpretation of“No Preference"damages the
initiatives process.

Election Board’s reinterpretation will also
erode rho long-term legitimacy ofsmdent inr-
tintivcs. Put simply, ifiniriarives come (o be
known us rubber stumps, wherein to pass all
an initiative needs is a majority ofstudents not
to care, then initiatives will losc my pets k

Johnston ’09 pointed out, then initiatives will
be dilutcd to thc point of urror impotcncy if
Elecuon Board's reinterpretation becomes
permanent.

For initiatives to accurately represent
student opinion, “No Preference" must rec
ﬂect exactly whut that option means. parhy,
not support, Uniormnnrcly, apathy cnnnor
bc wishcd away from tho clcction proccss.
When Election Board reinterpreted (lie By-
laws without any communication—much less
consultation—with the voters, that body did
the voters a disservice. More importantly, this
episode reveals a rather distressing ﬂaw within
Election Bo rd: it either lacks competence, or
lacks objccri L’y. If, on the onc hand, rho roins
tcrprcration of “No Prcicrcncc" was the rcsult
of Election Board's failure consult precedent,
then one must question the competence of a
board that not only forgets its established prov
cedures, but furthermore cannot even bother to
look them up. If, on the other hand, the reins
tcrprctntion was meant purposefully to "ensure
the success of [rnorc] initiatives," as it stated
in the SSH, then one must question Election
Board’s objectivity in the outcome. Indeed,
Election Board’s statement suggests that the
body is not beyond changing the process after
the factjust to guarantee the results it prcfcrs.

IiEicction Board wishts to cornbnt npnthy,
it should morc vigorously ndvcrtisc Initiatives.
This hns always been Election Boaid's job, and
it has done it quite well in the past. But let’s not
rewrite the rules just to change the results Put
simply, Election Board cannot merely popor
over studcnr apathy/ill must get to thc roor or
the problem, and persuade studcnrs tint initia-
tivcs are worth a lirdc nrrcnrion. Otherwise,
who knows what other “reintcl'plclalloIls” will
arise next time around.

Drunken debate

I was shocked and appalled to read the
gross misrepresentation projected onto the
collective Grinnell student body by one oflast
week's editorials. In “Not getting punk’d," the
otherwise usually accurate and informed SEE
cdirors commcndod students for watching
the first presidential debate when they “could
easily have spent that time getting drunk." 1,
lot one, resent that. With this statement, the
editors complctoly ignorc we studcnts ability
to inultitask. I am certain that most of those
Grinncllinns watching the debate were in the
process orsornc form or incbriarion. I would
further state that awaieness and drunkenness
are not mutually exclusive. In fact, I would
argue alcohol consumption can enhance the
political process, igniting passion in the timid
and mobilizing rho silcnrly cnrngod into ex-
pression. thn done in (ll: presence otpccrs,
drinking cnn encourage conversation, which,
at the least, will expose an individual’s true
polnicril knowledge. I myself have exposed
my lack of intelligence several times to those
more “\‘Vill'C7ﬂiKl more drunkithau I. So, I
humbly risk the honorable editors of the 5&3
to gct out more and see what ically goes on at
Gtiiinell. ll'yoit still do not believe me,l invite
everyone oi‘thorn to shine .r bocr with me over
