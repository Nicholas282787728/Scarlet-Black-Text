Confrontation
at Joint Board

at DAVID ARCHER

At ajoint Board meeting Tuesday night, an accusation of lying
provoked Vice President for College Services John Kalltbrenner
to confront SGA Assistant Treasurer Matt Cleinman ‘05 in an
apparently physically intimidating mariner, according to several
Witnesses,

Kalkbrenner said he was “absolutely not” trying to intimidate
Cleinmnn.“1was trying to get Matt to calm down for a minute,"
Kalkbrenner said,"l wanted him to slow down and have a meanr
ingful discussion."

Cleinman stood to ask Kalkbrenner to address “inconsisten-
cies” concerning how Student Services has incorporated student
opinion into its decisions, and he accused Kalkbrenncr of lying.
Cleinman said Kalkbrenner had been implying without evidence
that student opinion had contributed to the decision to close
southern Express

Kalkbrenner asked Cleinman if he was calling him a liar. Cle-
inman said he was not, but rather that he was trying to clear up
some inconsistencies. Kalkbrenner then slowly walked across the
room toward Clcinman, who was standing behind a table, until
the two stood {accrtOrface at opposite sides otthe table. As Kalk-
brenner approached, soa President Mark Henry “05, who was
sitting two seats away from Cleinman, stood, prepared to inter
vene. Henry said he worried that Kaikbrenner might punch or
grab Cleinman.

p.m.7and because Joint Board was "extremely disrespectful" to-

Henry said it “appeared to everyone involved as an act of in-
timldarion."

As students unsuspectingly waltzcd the
night away at Harris on Saturday, their wallets,
cash, P-Cards, and cameras were being stolen
from the coatroom.“At Harris Center over the
weekend we had nine incidents," said Steve
Briscoe, director of Security. "One may have
been from a previous weekend at the Harris
Center, theft of a camera.”

Students at Harris are not the only victims
of recent campus (118le Computers, an iPod
and money have also been stolen in the past
month.

Molly Miller ‘06 was one of the students
who had items stolen at Harris. “My wallet
was taken, and then found again by Security."
said Miller. Miller had to get a new post of
ﬁce box and have the lock on her dorm room
changed: “They took my keys from my wallet
and my cash, but they left everything else,"

Waltz was not the first time this type of
crime has occurred at Harris. At Fetish on Nov.
2' Pavitm Knnnnn ‘07 had her digital camera
stolen, The camera was in the eoatroom “in
my purse, on a hanger, covered by my coat, [so
that] you couldn‘t see my purae,"said Kannan,
who reported the theft to Security that night.

The thefts at Harris have led some stu-
dents to question Security. “Hopefully, they'll
start doing something different to prevent this
from happening and it wont be an issue," said
Millerr

suyog Shresrha ‘06, one of rho security
chiefs at Waltz, said Security was trying to

watch the eoatroom during the event: “I had
that in mind becausel had also worked a cow
ple of weeks back when we had a couple of
thefts. I was keeping an eye on the eoatroom,
but because 1 have to keep running around, I
can't always be there."

Shrestha warned members of Security
standing near the stage to
watch the eoatroom al-
though he said these stu»
dents’ primary job was to
watch over the stage. He
also pointed out the dif~
ftculty of distinguishing if
someone is stealing: "It's
hard to tell if someone is
rummaging through some
one clse’s pockets or trying
to find their coat,"

Some students have sugr
gestcd leaving the lights on
in the eoatroom to prevent theft. As Shrestha
pointed out, though, this was not a deterrent
at Waltz: “From what I remember now, the
lights were on almost all of the time in the
eoatroom."

Saurabh Saraf‘OS, Clo—Security Coordinar
tor, said Security does not normally leave the
lights on in the eoatroom because “we use ul—
traviolet lights for our stamps and we can't see
whether someone’s got a stamp or not if the
light is on,"

After reports of the first theft, Shrestha
said that security changed procedure. “Every

“1 never knew that a
laptop had ever been
stolen on this campus.
Had I been notified
that these things had
happened previouslyl
would have taken my
laptop with me."

time someone went in there and spent more
than a minute let's say, we would turn the light
on.”

In his post~Waltz security report Shrestha
suggested a coat check system or assigning
someone to watch over the coats. “We would
need an entirely different position,"said sarat.
“Basically we would need
someone to stand at the
coat check. That alone
wouldn't be enough, ei-
thcrrWe'd need some sort
of token system so pcople
could check in their value
ables. That would prob
ably complicate things a
little too much"

Despite disagreement
on how the problem will
be solved, members of
campus Security who
spoke with the SE37? all said there would be
discussion in the department about potential
changes

Perhaps the best solution is for students
not to bring their valuables to Harris. Saraf
said,“Maybe the problem is just people bring-
ing valuables. If you’ve got a eoatroom that is
not being gniarded in any way, it doesn't make
sense to bring something very expensive.”

After having her camera stolen, I<annan
has changed her behavior: "I don't leave any»
thing valuable in the eoatroom anymore. I
leave it at home or carry it on me."

Miller seconded Kantian, “If I were to go
this weekend, I would deﬁnitely pretty much
only bring my P-card and keep it on my per
son
One of the most visible victims of recent
campus theft is Miriam Stanton ‘05. Stanton
put signs up around campus after having her
Mac PowerBook taken while studying in an
art history seminar room in Bucksbaum on
Monday night. “I hadn't heard anybody around
for hours," she said “I turned offthe light and
closed the door, went to the Forum for a cup
of (0366. I was gone 20 minutes, mltybe 30 at
the most, and i came back and my computer
was gone."

While Stanton had received the email
about the Waltz thefts, she said, “I never knew
that a laptop had ever been stolen on this
campus," In speaking with Btiscoe, Stanton
discovered she was not the first victim of this
type of theft: “Had I been notiﬁed that these
things had happened previously 1 would have
taken my laptop with me,”she said.

Briscoe said that items stolen earlier this
month include an iPod from a dorm room
in East Hall, ajitcket from the Forum, and a
computer, money, a lab book and an iPod from
a dorm room in Cowles.

Briscoe was not sure whether there has
been more theft on campus this year than in
previous years. “Every year, about the end of
the semester, the theft rate goes up,” he said.
"it's Christmas time. People are looking for
money.”
