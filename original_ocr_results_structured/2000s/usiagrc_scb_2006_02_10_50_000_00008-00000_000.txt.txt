Black History Month elicits mixed feelings

or CAITLIN CARMODY

Vthn Dr. C l|"[CI G \Noodson started Negro
History VVeeL In 1926, he hoped that someday the
nation wouldnt need a yearly remindei thatblackhis-
torywas a pair ofAmeIlcan histon.

Eighty years later, Negro Hlstory Week has her
come Black History Month and many Glinncllians
me still waiting. Many question whether black history
has Ieally been incorporated Into the white American
narrative, and whether devoting {our weeks to black
history can produce productive dirloguc about Issues
that are usually consrdered taboo.

This month the college is sponsoring several
events in honor of Black Histmy Month, including
a presentation this Tuesday on the Negro Spiritual.
Concerned Black Students (CBS) is also hosting
events throughout the month,including panel discus-
sions, ﬁlm showings and theme parties.

The question for some, however. is not just how to
celebrate Black History Month, but whether to “I,
ebrate it at all.

Katya Gibel Azoulay, Anrhropology, said she sees
Black History Month as an “insult" and agrees with
actor Morgan Freeman that “we don’t have ‘White
History Month’ because we have white history 12
months ofthe year,”she said.

“The AnglorAmerican Protestant experience has
been normalized to such a degree that every other his
tory that makes up the American narrative is singled
out."

Some see Black History Month as an attempt to
fulfill politically correct expectations without actually
addressing problems orracism.

“we, the privileged population, know [acknowl-
edging black history] needs to happen, but we’re not
willing to give up all our white history or change the
curriculrn of the schools, [so] we’rejust going to make
it into a holiday," Emily Danielson ’06, member of the
Coalition of Anteracist Whites (CARW) said.

But Ralph Russell, Music professor and director
of the Young, Gifted and Black (YGB) choir, said
that while there are still problems regarding race in
America and at Grinnell, he thinks Black History
Month is important,just as Women’s History Month
is important.

“It gives us an opporninity to recognize the ace
complishments and contributions black artists, comr
posters, leaders and social activists who have given to
America and to the global community,"hc said.

Despite reservations about the value ofa months
ly designation, some Grinnellians are utilizing it as
an opportunity for education. Veronique Porter ’08,
vice spokesperson for CBS, said that CBS events are
meant to be informational and open to everyone, res
gardless of their race.

“In a lot ofmys, ignorance causes racism, and r
lor or prejudice comes from Incorrect teaching," she
said.

Porter thinks that the dedication of Hannibal
Kershaw Hall, currently East Hall H, on Feb. 23 is
an important milestone for the college because typir
cally buildings on campus are named after generous

donors. Kershaw, however, is being honored because ,

he was the first African»American to graduate from
Grinnell.

“For the college to acknowledge that money is not
everything is a step in the right direction,” she said.
“Most minorities don’t have a lot of money, and the
college Is acknowledging that and It shows they do
care to a certain extent.”

The college hrs made an effort to change the pre-
dominantlywhite composition otthe campus; over 20
percent of the entering class of 2009 were students of
color, up from 12.7 percent in 19% and 13.2 percent
in 2001, according to the Admission ofﬁce.

But Azoulay said that’s not enough.

“The assumption is that [the college] will remain
predominantly white, but we don’t say that. The as—
sumption is that new faculty will be predominantly
white, and then a special el‘rort will be made to find a
person orcolor," she said.

Talked about or not, racism is still there, Russell
said. He said that he often talks with students who are
Ignored by professors in class, or who feel excluded In
study groups or projects with other students.

According to CARW leader Jane Hereth ’06,
many students are surprised that racism is still a prob-
lem at institutions like Grinnell, which prides itself
on open-mindedness and acceptance,

“For white people learning about racism, it is
sometimes a shocking experience, and it takes some
adjustment and some hearing a couple different times
for white people to realize that this is going on," she
said.

This discomfort is reﬂected in the level of para
ticipation at campus events about race. Porter said
that race is something students are wary ofdiscussing,
noting that at an afﬁrmative action panel, for example,
‘only the bold will come out to even listen.‘

“When it comes to certain things, Grinnell gets
hesitant and quiet, and not as happy and quick to act

and participate In things that have to do with race,"
she said.
