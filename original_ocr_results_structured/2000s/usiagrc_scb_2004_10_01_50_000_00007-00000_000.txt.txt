Grinneil independent Theatre gets in touch with it’s in-
ner child this weekend in The Neverland Players

By EMILIA GARVEV

Once upon a time a young girl
named Kat Henry saw a play called
Grifﬁn's Tale at Northwestern Univer-
sity. This girl was intrigued. She loved
seeing stories written by kids being
performed and enjoyed by children and
adults alike. So after a year of dreaming
of doing it herself, she called out to the
four corners of Grinnell College came
pus for other creative souls.They came
bearing gifts of song, laughter and a
few feather boas. And so was born the
Neverland Players, Grinnell indepen-
dent Theater’s newest creation.

The group turned to the 3rd and 4th
graders at Davis Elementary School to
write short stories that they could turn
into scripts. “If they couldn't think of
something, we gave them prompts to
use, likezTclJ us about one of the scari-
est dreams you’ve ever had, tell us how
you feel about your siblings, or if you
were going to make a movie, what
would it be about?" Henry said.

The group narrowed a pile onOO
down to 20 stories with widely vary
ing themes, from frog dissection to a
superhero sleepover. Members of the
cast will play multiple roles, including

teachers, dinosaurs and parts ota spi-
der.

Since the Players'scriprs come from
such a unique source, the cast has taken
a unique approach to interpreting the
parts In early rehearsals, the lorpcrson
cast worked on the stories in groups of
three, then reconvened and discussed
who would be best for each role and
how to bring out the meaning of the
scene.

This creative process has its pitfalls.
When trying to draw out the humor in
their scripts, they sometimes get carried
amy.“College students get into dlscusr
sions about humor that can just turn
into being humorous discussions off
the track of the play," said Henry.

With a mixed cast, including a
member of the Ritalin
Test Squad improv group
and Sara Scannell ’05,
who worked in children's
theater this summer,
another challenge was
incorporating the wide
range or skills and spas
cialties the actors bring
to the performance. But

ties them together, according to Henry.
"What all the actors have in common is
an appreciation tor childhood nostalgia
and the ability to be silly."

During an early rehearsal, the Nev-
erland Players gathered to work on a
scene about taking over the school. Ben
l<im ‘07s keyboard had just arrived and
heimprovised arockand roll soundtrack
as Laura Marx ‘07 shouted out her lines,
as other cast members commented on
the scene under construction.The anir
mated cast will be aided by music and
costume accessories since the set will be
minimal, apart from a colorful patchr
work curtain that frames
each scene.

As musical director,
Kim has tried to make
the music “catchy, corny,

nd a lot offun,"

. He has written
original songs with Kat
Henry and parodies, like
“Ride of the valykries"
which has become “At-

om.
& 8 p.m.

tack of the Dinosaurs.” He has also
composed a special effects soundtrack,
simulating footsteps, door creaks and
cheap electronic video game music to
set the mood ofthe scenes without mu-
sical numbers.

Costumerwise, actors will wear
simple street clothes, but they have
dressed them up with accessories in—
eluding feather boas, aviator sunglasses
and cowboy hats. “It adds spice," said
Henry, “it's kind of like playing dress
u .

P Since the play is only about an hour
long, the experience will seem a little
more like a wacky variety show than
a traditional play. “The show is really
energetic, really silly,” said Henry. “It
combines the tmditional things that we
remember about our childhoods with
interesting twists." This weekend the
Neverland Players will present some-
thing rarely seen at Grinnell—chil-
dren's theater (or all ages. And, having
brought their dream to life, the Never-
land Players will live happily ever after.
