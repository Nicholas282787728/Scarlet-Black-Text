"It makes me Slth to think
about it. i don’t think its
going to be good tor our
economy: I don’t think it’ll be
good tor our international
reputation. Even if it were
good tor our economy, to
rather be in a recession than
have mass murder on my
conscience, i don't understand
how George w, can sleep at

"If Bush's reasons were just
what he says they are, which
is that it is for the good oiall
countries, 1 might have given
him a chance or deiending his
actions, but since it is obvious
that he has economic
motivations, going to war is
iust incredibly imrnomlx'

”i think the prospect or
unilateral action on the part
oi the us. is very dangerous
as far as our relationship with
Europe goes. ihis could
potentially lead to a pretty big
hit in the developed world.
It’s not worth the lives that
could be lost just to remove
Saddam Hussein when there
are a lot of other means that
could be used to rectiiy the
situation."

”Either way he's going to lose.
As it stands, if he doesn't go
to war, itll look as if this huge
superpower can indeed be
swayed, and Bush will look
like a real big idiot making all
those accusations if he
doesn't go to war, he’s got
public opinion against him,
with regards to the
internahonal antiwar opinion.
ljust see it as a norm
situation for Bush."

Faculty members examine their

For Ralph savarese, English, the ideal
protest begins with painr, posrors, drums, a
barbegue and a trampoline.

The last protest Savarcsc arrondod, which
began with a party at his houso complotc wnh
the posters and trampoline, was rho March
on Des Moincs that took place last fall. With

Since then, things have slowed down a

“I took that as a sign

Some also feel the conflict between civil

rho problem of balancing rho roles orrducae

Despite ncademra's reputation for clenchv

ures to keeping rho srudonrs grounded in

you a ready—made community in which you
all have discussions. "

McClelland agreed and :mphaslzcd that
rho quality ofsuch discussions are greatly ens
hnnmd by the diversiry of the contributors.
“it's much more likely in a collogo to run into
people who have a global vision about these
things," he said. “When you're in a college
atmosphere, you at loasr havo people who have
an international porspocrivo, who understand
that all Muslims are not osama bin Laden,

The classroom is not apolitical eirlror.
somo professors argue, and many find that
rho subject oflnlq comes up in class discuse
sions. When rho topic came up in Knpila’s
class on postcolonial lrroraruro, she thought
it was a good thing. She stressed the impor
ranco of boing able to “connect [current
ovonrsi to zdebarcyou’rc havingwirh Ilium»

rions with what you’re reaching,"

Addressing politics in the classroom nlso
requires caution, savoresc said. "One has to
be verycaieful about imposing ones political

view in aclassase pier
ressor," he said. “It's
clear where my own

in the classroom is
