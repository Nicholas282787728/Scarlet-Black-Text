Pub staying put, but may receive remodeling

Despite several rumors, the owner of the Down
Under Pub confirms he IS not moving, but may
begin changes to make the Pub more welcoming

 

HYJEI‘F RADERSTRONG

Popularly known simply as “the Pub," the Down Under Pub, a popular meet
ing place for students and community members alike, will very likely be under
going a transformation. For several weeks, rumors about the fate of Grinnell’s
downtown pub have been circulating widely among students who frequent the
Main Street bar. “Everyone that I heard from has said that the Pub is closing
and being renovated into an Irish pub,"said Becca Werner'os. “People said that
an alum bought it, which I thought was strange.”

The Pub has long been a Grinncll college tradition and the rumors ofit dist
appearing were very haid for some to hear. “I never connected with that feeling
or being upset about a space disappearing until I thought about the Pub going
away, said Jayn Bailey as, assistant director ofAlumni Relations. Fotmnatcly
tot weiner, Bailey and other Pub frcqilcntcrs pub owner James '"jimbo Tan-
zosch 88 has a lease on the building until at least 2010 However, Tanzosch
conﬁrmed that there is truth in some of the rumors Currently, he' is planning
on doing some remodeling to potentially convert the Pub into “The Grinnell
Ale House."

A pending renovation is likely to change how snidents use the space and
ultimately transform the culture and atmosphere of the basement bar The
downstairs will be more otaparty room with the orlgmal characteristics, said
Tanzosch. The upstairs will be more like an irish pub." This renovation will
provide a warmer atmosphere. as well as a larger food selection. With these
changes, Tunzosch is trying to move away from the current atmosphere of the
Pub to a more welcoming place for all students and townspeople.

“It will be really nice when it is done," he said.

Much of the speculation about the Fub‘s tunire, however, was fueled by a
recent purchase of the building that contains the Pub by Dick Knapp ’74. But
because Tanzosch and the other parties involved, including Knapp, are still in
the very early planning stages, it is hard to say when the remodeling will occur,
ifever, “Right now the plan is to look at it [the remodeling] starting to happen
in February to March But six months ago it was October," said Tanzosch. “It
is something that will take a lot ofmoney to do, so i don’t know if it will ever
come about."

Tunzosch sees the potential renovation as a way to stay competitive. “With
other businesses opening, with the campus pub, we have to do something to
be more attractive to students," he said, “The market for students has gotten
smaller each year. It's hard to base a business model on a shrinking market."
Tanzosch also ownsJimbo’s Pizza, which is moving to a new location Nov. 1 on
Main Street. It will he a few doors down from the Pub,with an expanded menu
and larger seating capacity.

Although a new name and a different interior may change what the Pub
means to students and other patrons, “Wednesday Night Pub Nights"are a pop
ular way to derstress in the middle of the week and the 100 Days senior party
occurs at the Pub each year. “I know that if students are going drinking in town,
it‘s more than likely at the Pub,"said Colin Thompson ’09.

But Tanzosch said is still trying to keep some of the old traditions alive. “I’ve
already said that the earliest we could start [remodeling] was after the senior
party," he said.“Because I thought that was important."

Seth Allen, the newly hired dean of Admis-
sion and Financial Aid, has been spending his
first semester on the job trying to personally
spread the message or the value of a Grinnell
education. Of the
10 weeks that he has
been with Grinnell,
he has spent six
traveling around the
country to meet with
prospective students.

Allen is one part
otsignincant changes
within the Admis-
sion ofﬁce this year,
following the recent retirement ofJim Sumner
and the addition of six new staff members.

Sumner was criticized as he exited for
comments about the “gayrfriendly” nature of
Grinnell. His retirement and the overall staff
shakeup represent a new attitude and changes
in the Admission Oﬂlce that may ultimately
reshape the makeup ofthe student body.

Allen said that Grinnell will always attract
intelligent and talented students but that there
is still room for improvement “I want to make
sure we have a consistent, robust and exciting
message to share with students early in [lie

process," he said. “I think this place is uniquely
situated to attract some of the most intellec-
tual and talented students."

Allen added that currently the college rails
to let people know that Grinnell is an educa-
tional environment
distinct from other
colleges. The Admisr
sion office is hoping
to spread the message
furthel by revamping
both the website and

means of communicate
tion with prospective
students. Allen would also like to see more
feedback about admissions services and the
campus from visitors and prospective stu»
dents.

Another new start member, Bryan Coy ’02
the coordinator of Multicultural Admission,
said that by ﬁnding creative ways to bring pro-
spective multicultural students onto campus,
the college can improve its diversity. “We are
at a good starting point,” Coy said, noting that
Gtinnell is pretty diverse in terms of race, reli-
gion and socioeconomic status.

But much of thc multicultural recruitment

process is separate and isolated from general
recruitment efforts. Coy said that he wants to
better integrate the two. Coy and Allen both
agree that teaching students early is essential.

Coy hopes to find ways to establish strong
relationships with guidance counselors as well
as connect with parents, since they are inilu»
ential in students’ decisionrmaking processes.
He said that this ﬁrst year will mostly serve as
an evaluative year to gauge potential areas of
improvement in multiculr
tural admissions

Despite the signiﬁcant
tuition increases, the Board
of TrusteesY recent an»
nouneement ofplans to cap
needrbascd loans should
help in improving diversity
on campus, and both Allen
and coy are hopeful that
this will help recruitment
efforts

Allen also said the office plans to utilize
technology to help manage workload and save
paper. In previous years, applications submitr
ted online were printed out and then data was
recntercd. This year applications will be read
on thc computer and no duplicate data will be
entered. Admission counselor Eli Best '07 said

’We need to work hard to gel
people to vii/[campus because

he was both surprised and embarrassed that
it has taken a school as environmentally cone
scious as Grinndl so long to go paperless.

Allen directly address the concerns that
many student have with Grinnell’s recruitment
policies, and said that he is dedicate to increas
ing multicultural, regional and socioeconomic
diversity. According to Allen, regional recruitr
ment practices an be improved by giving
greater respons ‘ty to regional admissions
ofﬁcers.

He also emphasized the
need to identify pockets of
students around the country
and the world that would ﬁt

With the new efforts
within the office to improve
overall admissions, Allen
said he expects to see results
of an increase in applicants,
selectivity and increasing di—

Best emphasized the commitment to con—

"We need to work hard to get people to visit
campus,"lie said. “Because once they visit they
tend to {all in love with this place."
