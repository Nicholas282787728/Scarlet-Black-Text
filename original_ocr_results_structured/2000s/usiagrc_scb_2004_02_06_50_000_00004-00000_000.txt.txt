move to Forum basement next summer, while the SRC will relocate to the Loose Pit lounge

by Leslie Boyadjian and Lau ren Standifer

Future demolition of the Younket Memorial Rsource Center (YMCA)
will necessitate the relocation of both the Mental Health and Health Celi-
ters and the Stonewall Resource Center (SRC). Before next fall, the Meli-
tal Health and Health Centers will move to the Forum basement and the
SRC to the Loose Pit lounge.

The current loatton otthe YMCA will be needed as a “staging area"
to accommodate equipment required to remove Darby Gym and build

the new Campus Center, A date has not yet been set to demolish die
YMCA.

Mental Health and Health Centers

cht summer, the Mental Health and Health
Centers will move to die Forum basement. The health
centers will occupy thc spacc in the Forum bascmcnt
currently occupied by the Private Dining Rooms
(PDRs). The FDR; will be renovated this summer
to accommodate the health centers.

Thc planning committce chosc thc Forum to
house the health centers bccausc it is handicap ac.
cessible and offers a large enough area to house both
scrviccs.

“We think it's important to have health and coune
seling together,” said Tom crady, Vite President for
student Services. "That’s working really well.” Coune
seling was added to the services offered by the onetampus hoalth cone
tcr last fall.

The health centers' moves will in turn displace other groups and
services. The Forum basement currently holds the SGA ofﬁces, Stun
dent Affairs, the PDRs and the Forum Terrace Gallery

Next year, the Forum will continuc to house SGA and studcnt
Affairs as well as the health centers. It is not yet known what will
happen to the Terrace Gallery Were going to be crunched up for a
couple ofycars while this is happening," Crady said.

Once the Campus Center is complete, rhc Mental Health and
Hcalrh centers will be moved to the space currently occupied by Cowlcs
Dining Hall. “We have to have good Health Ccntcr spacc and good
counseling," said Crady.

“We’re going to be
crunched up for a
couple of years while
this is happening.”

Stonewall Resource Center

The SRC will move to Loose Pit during Campus Center construe
tion,

The administration of thc SRC was given a choice for their new loca»
tiou at tho beginning ofthc scmcstcr bcrwccn a room in the Forum base-
mcnt and the Loose Pit lounge Alfredo Rivera ‘06, the assistant director-
or the SRC, said that the group those Loose Fit because it orfercd slightly
more space than the Forum, However, he is very concerned that the lounge
may not be large enough to contain all or the resources in the current
SRC.

The SRC is a multieroom Complex with a com»
purer room, kitchen, meeting room, library, bathroom
and social spate. Rivera is worried that the SRC might
have to get rid of some of its materials, perhaps by
giving away or throwing out books in the SRC library
that are outdated and materials they have multiple cop.
ies of

In addition to the problcm orspacc, Rivoia thinks
that the change or location could damage the atmo
sphere of the SRC, The current SRC was designed
with the intention otcteatiiig a space where students
would feel comfortable and secure. “The big issue is
how to find a safe, comfortable location," Rivera said
He considers the future home orthe SRC an lnconve»
nicut location bcoausc it's in a dorm and right next to
a laundry room, which may compromise the privacy of the area.

Associate Dean for student Lifc Michael sinis was the administrator
assigncd to find a new location For the SRC. “Wc’ic trying to make itsti1l
a convcnicnr placc and [affect] tho least amount of people," he said,
While he is not tntirtly satisfied with the arrangement, he said that tho
SRC’s placement in Loose Pit will be temporary and a hotter location will
be found after the Campus center is completed.

Sims believes there will be cnough spacc in Cowles to move both rhc
SRC and the Health Center in once the dining hall facilities movc [0 the
Campus Center. If the SRC does move into Cowlts, he‘ said thc area would
be renovated to accommodate its needs. possibly making it an even better
space than the current sac building. “In the long run, its going to be
better," he said. “Most people will adopt and tcalirc that this is what we
need to do,”
