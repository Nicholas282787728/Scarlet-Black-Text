Rape policy
protects students

Dear Editor,

1musr respocrfully disagre wirh columnisr Ben Brefman’s
asserrion rhir rhe college’s policies on rape are in error (“1ch
rhinking rhe college’s peliey on rape," April 20), rhough I do
applaud him for iniriaring discourse on such a crucial subrccr,

Mr, Brofman isserrs rhar rhe policy sends rwe contradic»
rory messages aboiir a srudcnr's responsibiliry while under rhc
influence oralcehol The conrradicrion srems from rhe follow.
ing clause in rhe policy: “college policy teeogni'acs rhar some.
one who is under rhe influence efdrugs and/or alcohol is un-
ablc ro givc censenr. Furthermore, being drunk is never an
excuse for raping or sexually assaulring someone." Mr. brofman
wonders why rhe college wouldn'r hold a drunk srudenr rcspanc

sible for giving censenr ro sexual inrcrcourse, when ir would
hold rhir same rrurlenr responsible for having sex wiih some
one who has nor given eonsenr ro sex, or for rhir marrer, drive

To say rhir vicriins of mp1: will be rrcared as such by ihe
college even if rliey were under rhe influence eralcehol when
rhey were raped, is nor ro conrradicr rhc message of texponsi»
biliry The college can emphasize iespensibihry while under

A policy in which eensenr given under rhe influence is valid,
for cxample, would eerrainly nor piorecr srudenrs who did nor
knew rhir subsraiices had been forced on rhcm. srudenrs who
“blacked out" dsrudenrs who clearly did norwanr ro cngage

under adiffercnr policy Sam and Alex ire daring. one nighr,
sam is very drunks sam doesn’t eensenr re sex wirh Alex, bur
rhcy have sex anyway. When 5am wakes up, Alex lies re sim,
relling sam rhar sam had given eonsenr. 5am feels guilry abour
having eensenrcd ro sex and does her approach Srudenr Ar
fairs or seek medical arrenrion. This is an insrancc where rape.

nor addressed.

1 wanr re address rwo oer. Brofman's other poinrs. He
asks “whatever happened re rhe ‘one nighr srandr" 1 would
argue rhar rhe growing recognirien of rhe rerrifying realiry of
dare rape killed ii. The college's policy canner prerecr rhe one.
nighr srind ar ihe expense of vierims of dare rape, Students
need re recognize rhey inay unwirringly huir rheir parrners when
rhey engage in one.nighr srands.

Mr. hrofinin also wrires rhar “no rapisr is going ro spend
rhe nighr and rhen wanr ro go our for brunch rho noxr day." A
rapisr who is anonymous ro his or her vicrim isn’r going re sriek
around, rhar's rriie, But most rape is ner anonymous, parricu.
larly en i college campus as small as oriiinell. seeking around
re have brunch is whar dare rape is all abeur. A rapisr who
sucks aroundsrill has powerover his or hervicrim and in many
cases will mainrain power for a long rime.

1 hope rhir srudenrs are rhinking and ralking abour rape
and rhe college’s policy because rhir is rhe way rhar we will
prereer each orhcr. For whar irs worrh, rhe college's definirion
of rape is iusr abour idenrical ro rhe srarc or lovva's donnirion.
This doesn'r mean rhar we should acccpr ir unquestioninglyr
bur ir does mean rhar Mr. Brofman’s argumcnr "seems re grare
againsr a cerrarn attitude" nor just in Grinncll, bur in lewa as a
whole, I’ve rried ro demonsrrarc rhar rhe college's policy, while
sensirive ro student’s emoriens, is a very reasonable plan.

Murray srraiis, a sociologisr and co.direcror for rhe Farms
ily Research Laborarery ai rhe Univ. echw Hampshire tar
porrs rhir ihe 1985 Nariunal Family Violence survey revealed
ihar among 1000 collplesi
rheie were 124 assaulrs by
wives agiiiisr husbands
and 122 a lrs by hus-
bands againsr wives. A
1998 srndy by rhe Univer-
sinrofpennsylvaniaschool
oflvledicine found rhar up

rhe Unired srares have

scx rclarionships. While
srarisrics on doinesric and
sexual violence are always
low because ofvictims’ re.
lucrance re reporr, rhc
numbers fer men even
more drisririlly undervttpresent rhe real siruarion, since men's
“masculiniry” is ar srike ifrhcy admir re having been abused,
and ofrcn rhey are nor raken seriously by police.

But someone needs ro rake ir seriously.

A boyfriend of mine was severely physically and sexually
abused by his previous girlfriend she hir him in rhe head wirh
a phone. She pur his head herwcen rhe marrress and box springs
and sir eu rhe marriess, She knocked his head forward againsr
rhe windshield when he was asleep in rhc car. When she ivanrcd
ro have sex and he didn't, she grabbed hold ofhis genirals and .
squeezed as hard as she could. one nighr she ivrnr so far as re
rear rhe foreskin from where ir arrached ncar rhe head of rho
penis; when he came back from rhe barhroem ifrcr washing off
rhe blood. she asked him ro go down on her. He did.

Anorher parrncr of mine was sexually abused by his older
sisrcr. 1r began when he was ran years old, and conrinued on a
regular basis for a year unril rhoir paranrs found our and interc
vcncd, Thcir family does nor rilk abeur ir now. She is now a
kindergarren reachcr.

Thc poinr is, sexual violence happens ro men. too; men
we know and love and go ro classes and parries wirh, 1r is nor
rhcir faulr any inerc rhan iris women’ssTo ask why rhcy allew
ir is re blame ihe victim; re assume rhar men should be berrcr
able re avoid ir or fighr ir eff is also blaming the vicrim, oucsc
rioning his masculiniry or manlincss. insrcad ofaddrcssing rhe
problem.

I fccl rhar Take Back rhc Nighr is nor really rhc righr place
ro ralk abour women abusing men The problem is rhar rheie is
no place for us so ralk abour women abusing men 1r is consid-
cred an aberrarien, pracrically a srarlsrical ﬂuke; ii is ree cmv
birmssing for mosr men ro ralk abeur. so ir doesn't gcr ralked
abeur.

But I have woken up nexr ro rhe man I love who is shak.
ing and crying because he iusrdreamcd rhar l was choking him.
1 have been woken by rho phone ar 3 am, because rhc man I
love nccds ro rell me how rhe girl who kcpr hirring on him afrer
he’s said “no rhanks" broughr baekall rhc rage and helplessness
he fclr 13 years ago in his sisrer’s bed.

There musr be a place for us ro ralk abour sexual violence
by and againsr borh men and women. Ws havc ro srirr speakc
ing abeur domcsric and sexual violence as a human problem,
nor a gender problem. We have re srarr ralking abeur peeple of
berh sexes rrcaring rheir parrners and famil lies wirh rcspecr and
inregriry and solving rheir problems wirhour violence we can.
nor ignore and rrivialirc rhc man who have been abusrdsimply
bccause rhey are in rhe minoriry. someone needs re lcr rhem
speak. roo. someone needs re ler rhem be able re sleep rhreugh
rhe nighr. 1

While it is true that
the majority of
sexual violence and
abuse is perpetrated
by men and boys
against women and

to acknowledge that
it does work in other

ways too.
