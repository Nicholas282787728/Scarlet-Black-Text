Au Fait

by Sarah Aswell
Ar‘ls Editor

As I am currently deep
in the thmws Ufa black,
black week of midsems,
I’m not going to shoot for
quality this week (as
usual, you ask?) but rather
for time. I understand that
the less time you put into
something, the worse it is.
I would have trouble
believing, roi instance,
that Milton's Paradise Lost
was written in "like, ﬁve
minutes." But i also
understand that I have
other things to do that
will ultimately be graded
on quality, not speed. This,
on the other hand, does
not get graded (and hardly
read) at all. In ratt, 1 get
paid in this, no matter
what I write

Anyway, this rambling
column is a welcomed
change from the English
papers I have been
wnting, which tend to
contain complete
thoughts, complex analysis
and words like elucidate,
astertain, discern,
obverse, pontiricate and
transpituous — words that
no one, with the exception
of your English teacher
and the people on
Hardball, use outside of an
analytical English paper.

or course, during
stressful academic weeks
such as these, you might
start to see the lines
between real life and
anademic life start to blur,
too might hear someone
looking to ascertain a
bagel in Quad or asking a
friend to elutrdate her
plans ror the weekend. You
might also rind yourselr
examining and scrutinizing
everything you see, be it
Joyce's use or
environmental writing in
Dubliners or pn‘me time
television,

“I don't mean to
pontificate," you might
say, "but I think that
Joeys motives and
feelings pertaining to
Pacey are both
tianspicuous and
decerebrate. to cite my
brother (2001) in reierence
to Joey’s actions, 'bitches
and lines, man, bitthes
and lives!"

In fact, I am
uncomfortable with this
column n'ghr now because
it does nut have a thesis
statement. Perhaps I’ll add
Brie here at the end so
that, in had the time to
sleep, 1 would sleep
soundly here it is,
Although doing a halts
hearted iob on my column
may upset my small
readership (hi, mom and
dad) as well as the overall
kamiatic state or the
universe, it neither hurts
my GPA nor greatly bothers
my conscience.
