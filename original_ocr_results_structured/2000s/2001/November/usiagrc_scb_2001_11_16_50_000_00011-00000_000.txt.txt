Contraction can’t,

America needed a national pastime. baseball was there to ml the spur.

won’t, musn’t be stopped at baseball

too many professional sports teams that aren't turning a big enough
proﬁt, instead orciirring teams, i think we should maicc it easy on
oilrxclves and cut whole sport leagues. Goodhye, Professional Bowl-
ing Association, Maioi League soccer and any league involving Lhc
word “extreme "

- Grinncll could rise some contraction, too. The college is giving
good money to the Classics and American studies departments to
ttirii out mayhe one mnjur and one concentrator each year between
(iii: two or them. We con easily cur both these departments, and
displaced majors could ahvnys he drartcd by other departments who
need a good Latin speaker or a solid, tim, American studier.

- Grin neil .itiiierics mil follow hasehail's lead and got rid oisome
orirs terms. Wliyshould tans he forced to choose hetwoen going to
a ioerhali gumc or a soccer game on the weekend? Let's get rid of
soccer and moire all the cX-socmr players punters on the football team.

- We lch too many medii outlets at Giinneii, too. The GUM
and KDIC can he combined into one super»olganiutlon. That way,
rather ihan inst attending people on campus, we can offend people
