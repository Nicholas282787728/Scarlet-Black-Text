RC, You lived in Ngerin for ren years. Lee‘s srnrr wirh rhe
pioeess oideeolonizarion rhcre. WlmdidAlgcria reel hire in 1962’

DB: I visired Algerin a few nines during rhe war oflndcpenr
dense. bur I serrled rhere wirh my ethusbnnd nghr nircr hides
pendenre, in 1962. Whnr 1 ﬁnd reinarl-oble is rhe very rapid elinngc
Alger in undenvenr in ﬁlm: and in menrohry. Arrer independence,
in 1962, end ror nvo or rhree years rirci rhnr, Algerin was biirsring
wirh enrhnsinsrn. Everyone thoughi rhar rhcy were going ro ere.

would, ar rhe some rinie, be very open ro rhe world. Many even
rlrougiir rhnr rhis wan o revoluiion, in every scnsc of rho word
eeonomie, social-rhar Algeria wns going ro experience There was
rhus grenr endiusiosin, espeeially nmongleirw rgeireles, rind many
revolurionaries from nines, from rhe Americas-from Cubnrwcm
ro parrieipare in rhc crenrion oirhis new Algeria Bur soon a npid
and regreriable change occurredThc revolurionsry srnre oimind
was rnpidly eondenined by rhc governmcnr end even rhe pm or
public opinion whirh wenred ro build a complcrcly nrnonnl srore,
one rhar would nor be revohirionary or all,

RC: Was rhe governnienr srill in rhe hands of rhe FLN (rhe
polirieal wing of rhe guerrillas who liberared Algeria from rhe
Freneb).>

DB: Yes, rhc FLN, uniorrunrrely. wns rhesole poliricol party,
and rhis sole perry wns allied ro rho ermy, as Algerinn ilidcpcn»
denre was grined rhrongh war. Thus, rheie wns :u'l ellinnre be.
rween rhe perry, rhe Nsrional Liberarion Bionr, end ihe rrmy, rhe
Narional Liberarion Army. 0irhese rwo forces, which rook power
inro rheir hands, neirherwanrcd ro haves revolurion in rho sense
rhar European leiowing pirries, iorexarnple, orrnbnre ro rhe word.
Thus, one soon undersrood rhar rliere would be e srrong onc-
pnrry governnienr wish a very srrong army and police, And rhere
was 2| eonp d’e'rnr which pur a soldier or rhe head orrhe govcrnr
menr. This was Preridcnr Boumediennc, who was, on one hand,
d soldier, end on rhe orher, a quite aosrerc Muslim. There was in
underseoring oirhe idea oirrndirion and she idea oinarion, end
rho Algeriin norional iden eould be summenred in one phrase i a
single narion, nsingle religion, and a single lingnnge.

RC: And so rhere was nor a role roi rhc Berbers.

DB, Righr. There wn on imporranr quesrion posed or die
riine abonr rhe Berber minoriry. The Berbers, pnrrrrulorly rhe
Knbyls. were oiren very acrive during riic period ofdecoloniinrion.
They were oiren rhe rnosr edaeared people. They do nor, how»
ever, regard rhemselves es Arrbs nr all. They consider ihernselves
ro be profoundly diirerenr. By rhe way, Kabyls are Muslims, bur
rhey do nor neeepr rhe norion oiAlgerin as an ArnboMiislini
counrry. This is somcrhing rher is imposed upon rhem, and is o

very big problcm, l<nbyls fccl rhemselves excluded from rheeoun.
try ind rhus eonsrirure quire r srrong opposirion.

RC in an Algerian dociimenrnry [ have recenrly seen, 1 was
surprised by do ouahry oirhe Flench oirhe women inrerviewed.
Whar is rhe linguisiie sirnarion in Algeria?

DB : 1 \er myselrsurprised by rhe very high quality oirhe
ircnrh rhey used. I think rhe direrror seleered women who were
very cuirivireol nnd heovily inﬂuenced by Franee, beenosc she knew
rhiir rhe ﬁlm would be norehed mainly in innee. There are srill
ninny people who sperle French in Algeria, bur ii is no longer
everyone. Besides, rhe l-‘renrh iliey do spenlr is oiren e bod French,
reduced ro a few words, and spoleen wirh n very bad erreanhis
is doe ro “Ambization.” One oirhe obyeerives oirhe postrcoionnl
governmenr wis rherirabnirion oirhe ednearional sysrem. Bur ir
wns poorly enrned our, and Algerians soon became illirerire in
rwo nguagcs: rhey did nor really rry to leirn Classical Arabic,
and rliey losr rheir isnowledge of French. The usage oiwrirren
lengurge is now reserved ro an ehre who go ro privare schools and
go to univeisiiy abroad, because is is very dimenlr ro ger a good
ednenrion in Algern. There is a shorrrge ofxvelleedumtcd rench.
ers, end a very high number oiyoungehildrcn ro pur inrosehools.
so in primiry sehools, mosr children go to sehool for rwo hours i
day Each rereher has a group 050 pupils, and several groups use
succeed ceeh orher chronghour rhe day.

RC : ler's go on so SubeSaerali Africa. In your opinion, whar
are rlie big diirerences berwoen Norrh nnd wesr Africa?

DB : Firsr, more is rhe nuesrion oilslain in do norrhern pair
of siib.5ah.-rrnii Airioi, rhe Chrisrinn mlsslonarics’ presence has
leir very iew rraees, cxccpt in certain eounrrics, where one srill

siib.3nhninn Airioi, rhcy do nor elosc women up. Women have
Freedom ofmovclncm, 1 would nor sny, however, rhir lerving rho
house is rlweys plensiiiir for rhcm : they ire heavily esploired ecor
nomicelly, bur or leasr rhey have a freedom oinerion rhnr is much
grenrer rhrn in Norrh Airien And rhere hes nor been nny lslamic
riindnmenralisr rerronsm in Sub-Saharan Arrirr, unlike in Bgypr
or Algeria. Conﬂicrs do :xlbr in rhe region, bur rhey rake rhe iorrn
orinrenerhnicwirinre. One oan iaie rhe example oianndo and
Burundi, rwo Cerirril Airienn eonnrnes, which used ro be called
rhe Swii-eerlend oiArrieo These rounrries undcrwenr horriiyrng
mnssneres lr is obviously impossible ro say rim rhings are berrer
in Silbrsalinran Arriei rlinn in Norrh Mrien. Then rhcrc is rhe
oriiei- problem, ind a very considerable one AIDS. iorrnnareiy
for Norrh Airici, ir seems rhar AIDS has iorgciy passed ir by, bur
ir has niviged orhcr pnrrs ofAFriczi, more so in rhe sourh nnd em
rhrn in rhe wesr. lr is on niilierion which makes one worry abour
rhe inrnre orihese eonnrrics, as rhcre is a considerable process of
depopularion in progress,

RC: According ro some ionrnnlisrs, rho mnssneres in Algeria
are rerunily rhc work oirhe governmenr, as n mcnns oieowing rhe

popularion, rerher than rhar or fundrmeniahsrs. Do you iliinle
rhis may be rhe use?

DB: Ah, rhis is rhesubieer oia maior debare righr now. There
are people who think rher rhe governmenr hrs on irnporranr role,
or in any case, a nonnegligible role. in conducting die massacres.
I musr say diar rhere are some extremely rroubhng has. Every
rime rhere is o missacrs, one noriees a surprising abseneo of gov.
ernmenr milirrry forces, rhey never inreivene, rliey are never even
rhere, There have been resrimonies by oiTireis who have lcir Alge-
ria, and who now sry rhor rhey wirnessed mossaeres eonducred by
rhe army irseli. There mighr be cerrnin :xaggcnnons, bin, in my
view, if r lsrge and welieouipped army like rhe Algerinn army
does nor proreer civilians, iris because ir does nor wanr ro.

RC: Finally, whar is rhe giearesr problem {need by Airiee ro.
dey, and how do you think ir oin ir be solved.)

DB: I'll rell you in ndvrnee rhar l don'r have rny solnrions For
any problem. Although your ouesrion nslrs for a preeise answer, I
cannor name only one problem; I'll menrion rwo. one is rhe
polirioal problem: rlie esrablishnienr oi democracy, rhe end of
rliesc horrible governinenrs whose only rim is rhe enrichment oi
rhe head oisrnre and rhe lirrle mihrery elire rhar surrounds him.
Obviously, :5 long assueh governmenrs oeisr in Africa, no progress
is possible. The second problem is AIDS, nnd rhar is a dtmuV
gmphic problem oiinronresiable gmviry. i think rhe rieher coun»
rries have x responsibiliry, r role ro play here. uniorrunarely, ex-
perience shows us rhar rhc role piaytd by rhe richer counrriesa
Wesrcrn Europe end rhe Unired srareshos orren been a negirive

enough ro rhinle rhnr rhese problems do nor concern us, They
ecrrrinly do.
