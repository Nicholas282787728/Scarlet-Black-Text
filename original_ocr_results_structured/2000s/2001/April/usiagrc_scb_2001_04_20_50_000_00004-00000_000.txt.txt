Making the world ours

1 don’t have time to sleep,
and this is a problem. To
solve this problem, I do
what I always do to solve
my problems: I hopped
onto the internet and
typed the keywords of my
problem into a search
engine.
The internet showed me a
picture of ozzie Osborne's
head grafted onto Miss
April’s body. More
importantly, it told me
that all I need to do is
take Short 20-minute
power naps to feel
refreshed and ready to
face the day. The experts
said that power naps are
”just as good as eight
hours or sleep” and that
they felt “as good as a
blood transfusion” and
would “replace [my]
coffee intake."

' For their lame evidence,
these experts cited that
hmous successful people
like Winston Churchill and
Thomas Edison relied
heavily on the power nap.
They implied that we
wouldn't have things like
light bulbs or capitalism if
people didn’t go lay down
for a few minutes.
of course these experts
did not take into
consideration that
Churchill was merely
ﬁghting a world war, not
attending a competitive
liheml arts college. Sure,
he had to sit in on a few
meetings and save the
free world from
oppression, but he
certainly wasn’t carrying
17 credits, didn’t have
play practice right arter
addressing his nation and
didn’t have a paper due
the morning after Why.
And he certainly never
had to attend Joint Board.
All things considered, 1
still attempted to take a
power nap yesterday of
the allotted twenty
minutes, I spent three
minutes locating my
pillow, two minutes
setting my alarm, one
minute opening the
window, four minutes
trying to decide if was too
cold to have opened the
window, ﬁve minutes
cursing my loud ﬂoor
mates, one minute closing
the window, two minute
changing my mind, one
minute opening the
window, and one minute
dreading the sound of my
alarm going off.

After this nap i felt
neither refreshed nor
rejuvenated. In fact, I
felt upset, confused, cold
and a little hungry, Not to
mention that I didn’t
come up with any
humanityealtering
inventions or conquer the
Germans. I need coffee for
things like that.
