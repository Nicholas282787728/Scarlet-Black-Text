We asked several members of this spring’s

 

alternative breaks to share their projects,
insights, and experiences with us. Their work
was diverse, including community gardens,

housing construction, anti—slavery work and

Projects: Reach Out and Read, American Anti Slavery Group

In Boston we spent the ﬁrst week
with Reach Out and Read, a nationwide
program headquartered in Boston that
works with area hospitals to distribute
books to both pediatric in—patients
and well children in waiting rooms.
Our group split into six groups and
volunteered at six different hospitals
and clinics reading to children,
organizing and ordering books, and
helping our coordinators to spread the
word to parents and the community
about reading and how much good it
does for kids.

The second week we spentwith the
American AnticSlavery Group, an
organization that primarily works to
combat slavery in Sudan, where tens
of thousands of Sudanese in the south
have been taken and captured,
brutally tortured and kept as slaves

 

by those in the north. The AASG also
works to fight slavery all over the
world, however,including (illegal)
slavery in the United States.

While some of us called supporters
and posted fliers in churches and
schools about the annual AASG
Freedom March to take place later this
month, others worked the “phone-a—
than“, raising over four thousand
dollars for the organization. All of us
spent three or four hours petitioning
every day and educating the public
about the issue.

In our downtime we kicked around
Boston, saw the sites, walked the
Freedom Trail, got lost->3 lot. But had
much fun! The experience was
exhausting, physically and
emotionally, but overall a very positive

one.

For the first week, we worked with
Martha Goodlette and Friends of PcPatch
on organic community gardening
projects throughout the city. We worked
primarily in low-income housing areas
and had a chance to work with residents
and community members, often
southeast asian immigrants, on a few
of the gardens.

For the second week, we worked
three projects: The Gi ng Tree
Woodshop, High Point Community After-
School Program, and some parks and
recreation work in the south division.
The Giving Tree Woodshop was created
to offerjobs for men 55 yrs. & older
who have been chronically homeless for
at least a year. The shop make wooden
toys which it sells (the proceeds of
which go to homeless families) and also
donates to children who are homeless
and/or in need.

We had a chance, also, to take a
tour of “The Real Change"~~$eattle’s
homeless newspaper-as wellas tour the
city with Jim Diers ('75), an alum who
now works as thd Directorof the Seattle
Department ofNeighhorhoods. Between
the two weeks we camped on the San
Juan Islands north of Seattle

break experience was having the
opportunity to work outside in the
communitry gardens of Seattle. The
second day we worked in the gardens
we had a real challenge in front of us.
We were supposed to tear out the old
terracing system of a garden on a hill
so a new, more stable system could
be installed. The land had not been
gardened for a couple years and there
was a lot of general cleaning up to
do. The most difﬁcult part was trying
to get the heavy boards, bedframes,
and other miscellaneous items
embedded in the mud out of the
gmupd. The next challenge was
getting out of the way quickly once
you moved the larger objects so you
weren't caughtin an avalanche of mud
and little. The work was physically
demanding, tiring, dirty, and
wonderful. I fell we all bonded over
the experience because most of the
objects were too big to be moved by
one person and required group effort.
When we were done at that garden I
think we all felt a sense of pride. We
could see what our work had yielded
and imagine what the garden would

\ One of the best parts about my alt

Debate team scores at nationals

As many of us were relishing in rho dclighrs
of laziness during Spring break, {our crinndl
students were in Denver. Colorado, represent»
mg the college at the National Parliamentary
Debate Assocranon’s National Championship
Tournament.

The two roams, onc composed of Gal-re
Rosenberg ‘03, and Geoll'chnson ‘03, and the
other ofNull-nn Smith ‘03, and Matt Blake ‘04,
Went to [hoopen tournament, dong with around
270 other teams from various collogiaro institu-
tions across the nation,

Rosenbcrg and Swanson, borh ofwhom have
been involved in debate during the past two yum
ar Gl'innell, argued themselves through qualilye
mg rounds and three rounds ofslnglevellminn»
lion, to be defeated fmnlly by one of uc.
Berkeley’s cop reams. Although they did not re-
ccivc a specific ranking, lllc run that Rosenberg
and Swanson mode it to “doubleoclos” means
that they were on: of rho [op 32 team: at the
conference. Smith and Blake, a more novice
team, did well in the preliminaries, but not
enough so to make u mm any oFthcslnglc»elllnl»
nation rounds.

The debaters conveyed strong Feelings that

surprisingly, however, when the debate team
members explained what rhuy had learned, their
comments focused not so much on the sharpen-
ing oforzll expression skills, bur rather the diver-
Qty in thoughts and styles ofdifrcrcnt debaters
and Judges. chnson, Rosenberg, and Smith mch
mentioned that reams ofall difrcrcnr skill levels,
educational institutions, and geognphl: regions
of the counrry attended the (ourrnmcnt.

Not only did mcy debate against learns horn
schools such as Berkeley, Washington Univcn
sity, and Rice, but they were also competing
against mm from community colleges It was
also interesting, as Smith pointed our, to argue
with debaters who had very different sets orbs.
licfs than What is often found 1! Grlnncll: “oc-
casionally you will ﬁnd yourself arguing with
someone who assumes that iryon no call :in

ali'lmlons about the students who attend these
debate tournaments, such as they tend to be mom
politically liberal and a great number are pre—
law polltlml science majors, u is largely a racially,

sociocconornially,andgcographrcdly diverse

Even more diverse than {he srudcnc de—
batting were the judges, whose poluical views
and dcbarc experiences mngcd the spectrum.
Rosenberg and Smith horh described this di.

because ic meant that you had to adopt your
debate style when presenting before different
people. It's one dung, smith said. to convince
something to a socially llbeml college student,
and quit: anachcr to ny to convince n right-
wrng middle»ag:d worker,

Ofcoursc, the debates often forced (hcstu-
dents to rake on poinu ofvicws with which
they didn't agree. As Rosenberg sud, “I’ve ar-
gncd for communism, I've argued ngnrnscoom.
