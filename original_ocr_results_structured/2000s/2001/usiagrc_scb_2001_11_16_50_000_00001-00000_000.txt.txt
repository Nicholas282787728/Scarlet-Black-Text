When philanthropists around the world turned their
attention to New York after the Sept. II terrorist attacks,
many predicted that other charitable organiaarions would
soon feel a ﬁnancial crush, As Dan Inkowitz ’02 pointed
out last week at South Beach, this made last week’s
fundraiser by crirrnellians Escalating AIDS Response
(GEAR) all the more important.

The Friday night event, which was headlined by rolk
singer Brenda Weller, raised over $2000 to beneﬁt
MasHarnbaneou, an orphanage in Zimbabwe for children
whose parents have died ofAIDS.

Roger bauman, REC. employee and brother orcowies
supervisor Lyle Bauman. presided over an auction that in.
chided such items as handmade crafu, home-baked foods
and dinner with Steve Larson.

The evening began with a performance by brothers
Fradteck and Samuel Mujuru, the Cowles visiting artists.
The Muiuru brothers play the mbira. a Zimbabwean folk
instrument that resembles a thumb piano.

Since the Muiuius are from Zimbabwe. itseemed ap.
propriate that they kicked oirrriday's event to raise rrroney
roran organivntion in theirown country, thousands ormrles
away

Btencla werler topped orrrhe evening with an moving
performance, singing songs ﬁom her latest live album and
taking requests from the audience. She sang on a darkened
stage surrounded by lit candles rot over an hour.

sic scene in 1997. She has performed at Grinneil several
times, and asked only a nominal fee torsingirrg at the AIDS
