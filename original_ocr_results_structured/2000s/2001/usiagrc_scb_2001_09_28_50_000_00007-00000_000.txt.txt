roux Hmn?
[here have been some really fun things that happened
down here. I can remember the first or second week
we were open we had a Saturday where the place was
just packed to the gills. A couple of students came in .
. . and there were only two places to sit and they were
at a table where there were already a couple of
businessmen and a couple of little old ladies from the
Mayflower. So, they got their coffee and just kind of
stood there. I came around the counter and ushered
them over to the table and said, ’Here are a couple of
seats; have a seat: I think they were a little
uncomfortable at first, but by the end of the morning
they were just having a great old time talking to
people. Actually . . . one of the girls ended up making
friends with the people from the Mayﬂower home and
they would meet down here a couple of times a month,
I couldn't ask for anything more than that, That’s
really the sort of thing I’ve been looking for, in terms
of the effect of the business on the community. I
really like the idea that people can come in and feel
comfortable in the store; there needs to be more
places like this in Grinnell. 1 have great hopes for The
Mainsqueeze. . . [he more opportunities the whole
community gets to intermingle, the better off the
whole community is going to be.

Interview with Café Phoenix proprietor

WNV om ran (one no Gnrunttt?
Illked Grinnell when Ifi'rst moved to Iowa. . . I loved
the old architecture Other things that attracted me
[to Grinnell] that day were the hospitality of the old
proprietor of the longsgone eating institution, the
Longhorn, and [the] freestanding newspaper store. I
hadn’t seen one anywhere etse in Iowa.

Wntnt ARE you onrrruattr than?
I was born in Egypt, but my home is Chicago. I got
sick and tired of the corporate world, and I had the
chance to open the place in Grinnell and I did. I
opened it in '92.

"Int putt" was WE Cart PHOENIX?
No, in ’92 I opened one right next to the newsstand,
called The Last Egyptian. . . rhat lasted for a little
over two years, [until] Ilost the lease on it. t . Some
of the customers who got used to what I served didn't
want to see me go, so they ﬁnanced this place [cafe
Phoenix]. I closed Ihe Last Egyptian in the December
of '94 and I opened here in May of ’95.

Community businesspeople describe
their lives and livelihoods in Grinnell

town, and because it is a Small town arid a small
college, there is . . . much direct interaction between
the college and the town. [Grinnell is also] a small
Iowa town, I saw some support [for the restaurant],
and I probably would never have found this kind of
support in a bigger town, or anywhere else. So. it’s a
combination of my wife not wanting to move anymore,
[that] l love the architecture of the town, [and that] I
love the sense of relative ease of conducting business
here. The people here were great supporters, and, in
business, your mainstay is your customers. If you have
their support, why go elsewhere?

How on You MEASURE GRINNELL [attic-E's mm UN "is lowii?
when I started, one or the handicaps 1 had was thatI
refused to offer the mainstay of meat and potatoes. I
wanted to do something that I’m familiar with, good
at, and something that I enjoy making and eating, and
that’s MiddlerEastern cuisine, A lot of the Grinnell staff
are wellctmveled and that colors the community at
large. Many people in the community abo travel, and
the students come from all over the horizon.
Consequently, people who come to visit the town come
from allover. . . The influence of traveling cannot be
measured at all, [because] when people travel outside
of their immediate comfort zone . . . they will start to
understand the real world, rather than Poweshiek
County, or Jasper County, or Polk county, which could
be a very closed society unless you blended it in with
the rest of the worlds

tumMEx EASE?

A substantial portion. In many ways [Grinnell
students] give me the renewed vigor of youth. Every
year I see a new class, and they are different, but they
are the same. One of the things I ask prospective
students and their parents is, ’Are you a nerd where
you are?’ And they look at me like ’No, Iani not a
nerd.’ I say, ‘Well, are you different from the rest of
your class?’ Uh, yeah: you will ht in fine: Grinnell has
a tendency to attract really, one way or the other,
highecaliber students, regardless of where they come
from. [hey are, in a sense, estranged in their own class
where they come from, but, at least from an outside
perspective, they come and they find camaraderie
between them and their fellow students Many people
[already told] them, ’You are not alone.’ Once they
meet other people like them, they really know they are
not alone. That’s what makes them stay and continue
with higher education,

My first staff member ever in town was my adopted
son [Cory 2oll '92],- his children are introduced to me
as This is Grandpa Kamal.’ Many of them [Zoll's
classmates] still come and visit, and many of them
stay in touch, This is because I don’t particularly want
a business: I try to establish a community.
