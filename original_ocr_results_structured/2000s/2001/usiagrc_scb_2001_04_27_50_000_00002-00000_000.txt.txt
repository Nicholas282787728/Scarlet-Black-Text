R0 U 9 h D rafts: Week-end news briefs

Coke cause pulses out

No further nctions to persuade thc college's ad-
minisrrorion to withdraw from January’s exclusive
controcr with a CocaeColn border are planned for
this school year, say members of Grinnell students
for Choice.

GSC was organized early this semester, in response
to Dining Services head Dick Willrarns's signing of
the contract. At one point the group discussed ine
voking a seldomused portion of the student hands
book to call for an emergency referendum which, if
passed, would have institutionalised a student boy.
cott by requiring the college to identify “boycotted"
food and to provide alternsrives. The group neither
organized this referendum nor submitted any stan-
dard student initiative to the campus last week.

“it seems like student interest has really flagged,
partially because of the break. and partially bccsuse
there was what was perceived to be a concession.”
said Gabe Rosenberg 03, referring to an agreement
in which the border gave permission for some brnnds
of Nantucket Nectars iuice to be sold at the Forum.

nomination ofBrandon Zicht ’02 as next year's SGA

A number ofsrudents spoke in Zicha’s defense,
including Ford, current AC Don Morgan '01, and
former AC iim Dinnerville ’01.

“Brandon is an aggressive person," said Ford.
“There is a difference in behavior between profes-
sional and personal behavior, Brandon did not per.
haps [in the past] have the same guard: on his cone
tact that i think he would have in the position of
AC."

“1 was not necessarily sold on Brandon," said More
gan, who worried about Zicha’s temper and patience
until a telephone interview with the candidste. ”He
said that being a senator is fundamentally different
from being to A0, bio behavior on the phone was
very indicative ofwhar an AC would be."

"I would ask the Senate to consider whether Ins
ing aggressive as a senator is the best way to be a
senator," responded Melis. “Brandt" wasn’t wearing
a different hot when he came to me in my room—
there me many different ways people interoct as sena.

The new policies would apply to tiny “all—cam.

Harris Center on weekend evenings. Details still
need to be hammered out, she said, avchGAcon-
cerrs and other non-ACE cvents.

“Is it going to drive more students back in the
halls? I’d think that's a good possibility,” said
Krohn. “The lssr thing we want is to go back to
where we've been in the past,whero we find people
under bushes, in their rooms. I have lots of faith
and trust in our students, that students will watch
out for each olhcra . ,. our hope is that people un-
derstand that we're under o pretty close eye right
now, and we will be next year."
