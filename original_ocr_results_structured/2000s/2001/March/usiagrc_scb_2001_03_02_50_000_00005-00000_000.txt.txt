Seniors Carissa Page and Tor Janson share their plans for the future

Staff Writer

Carissn Page had decided long ago rhnr
she was headed to graduarc school after she
finished at Crinncll. Her studies abroad last
year, however, forced her to chsngc her
plans. Now Page is heading for Guaremnla
to work as a pcscc observer in warvrorn
communities. Tor Jonson's Story is strik-
ingly different, for lhroughout his entire
undergradunrc career he has been directed
rowards environmental protecrion. Since
graduating lnsr December, he has been
working in lowa wirh an environmental
group reconstrucring prairie. Ycr ncirhcr
Page nor Jansen have decided cxrlcrly What
rho fururc holds; insmacl rhey are enjoying
rircse temporary. unique oppoiruniries

Page, a political science major wish a
Latin American sludics concentration, was
planning on heading ro graduate school imc
mediarely afrer graduation, mosr likely in
inrcrnarion‘al relations or Lnrin American
studies, This plan was altered, however,
when Page made the choice to srudy abroad
during rhc spring ofhcr junior year, Afrcr
spending her ﬁrst monrh in San iosc, Page
spcnr rhc rest of [he semesrcr in Nicara-
gun, and (hen stayed for rhc summer
through a Noun lnrcrnship Granr work
ing on a project documenting elderly
women’s oral histories,

Page repcorcd rhcsame messsgc lhar has
been reircrored by many srudenrs who have
srudied abroad: experiencing a differenr
culrurc firsrhand can be lifccchanging. ln

mnny ways, she reels rhrrr she learned more
in Latin America in rhesc scvcn nronrhs
rhsn she did in oil of her previous rime

imporrsnr lender in rho civil war nnd she
spoke re people everydsy who were going

about. Through her ex.
pcricnccs living in
Nicaragua, she cl:-
raincd an educarion
rhar simply cannor be
achieved on the second
floor ofARH.

“I an an inrensc
need to go back drier
studying sbrosd," Page soid, and rhis dc»

and instead rhere wss a focus on finding
progrsms working wirh people in Larin

Page decided rhai her inrercsrs werc roo poe

Network in Solidariry wirh rhc People of
Guatemala _ which is a nongovernmcnral
organizarion working for peace and stabll»

communities in Guatemala rhar have
sought assistance from NISGUA as refuc
gees from the civil wrrrnrc returning ro rhcir
abandoned homes. As one oleSGUA’s inc
rernarional accompanicrs, Page will live and

Page is connecrcd ro NiSGUA’s Rapid Re»

sponsc Network, which will immediarely

nit-n a larger international community of

people to pull rogerher rheir resources ro

After rhe year that
she spends in Guam-

on going to grsduare

rimarcly obtain a

In many ways, Grinnell was rho perfccr
place ro prepare for this type of Job. Janson
recognizes rhe biology department as pro-
viding excellent preparsrion, and he also
feels that as Grinnell he was able to develop
strong writing and research skills. Grinncll

college also helped to connecr him (0 inc

Janson‘s work with ss a coordinalor wirh
EAG on campus augmented his ecologyc
focused educanon and provided him wirh
experience in organizing and dirccring
people and events.

The job conrracr is for two years, and
“we'll see what happens from there,” Janson
said. He is srill learning whar he wants to
do, and mosr likely rhis job will give him a
clearer sense ofwhar he wanrs ro rry nexr.
Wharcvcr rhc furure mighr bring, Jansen
remains oprimlsnc: “I feel like i'll olways
be able to find s job that I like and find
mcsnrngful, even ifir’s nor my dream job,”
His commcnrs reflect an zcccpmnct ofun-
ccrrainry in exchange for being happy. ll is
rhe same arrirude rhor Carissa Page carried
as she explained how she vvssn'r guirc sure
how rhis Guatemala rrip would rie inro her
future plans, especially since her longcrerm
plans are srill in developmcnr. This attitude
is somewhar comforring for rhose ofus still
undecided about our furures, Twenty-two
is young enough to be still working our rhc
dcrails _ cvcn rhc basic srrucrurc is srill
ncgorinblc at rhis poinr, yet even if the
grand picture is nor complerely worked our,
Jansen and Page show mar rhcrc are some
remarkable things to do in (h: mesnrime.
