week-old Cairn Terrier named Euzn.

Euzm, who has been a member nfrlie Osgood Family for abour rwa mnnrltx. is
named nftcr Presidenr Osgood‘s greur—grear—grendferher. John Guthrie. Euzn IS
the Gaelic form of rho name John. Osgood has two orher dogs besides Euzn, a

_ King Charles Spaniel end s rerrier. According to Osgood Euan does nor get along
very well wirh rhe orher rwo dogs T"hey are borh quire old and sednred. and he's
frisky and Jumps around.

Euan was chosen by Osgood because he is reminiscenr or a Cairn Terrier rher
Osgood had when his children were young. "We hzd enorher cairn Terrier and he
lived to be very elderly and grew up wirh all of our children. Now rhor iny ehiie
dren are all grown rhey’re rhriiled ro have another Cairn Terrier. They're great wirh
kids; they’re Just wonderful dogs,"

Osgood chose to get another dog as : slirprlsc for his wife. "I had always
weiired [anorhcrdog]. said oegeod. so when he sztw an sdyerrisernenr in rhe Des
Moines Register for s Calm Terrier. he and his daughter wenr re ger rhe clog
without telling his wife. When Osgood wenr ro see rhe dog he looked litre our
orher [Cairn Terrier]. He was sure."

Euzn hrsheen errreeringr lotofattenuon around esinous, alniesr "roe much”
jokes Osgood. He recently attended an SGA ioinr Board meeting with Osgood,
who thought ir "might he nlc: ro hay: an animal at Joint Board,”

In fact. Osgood mainly took Euan to Joint Board in order ro give his wife a
break from caring for the dog. Osgood nored that the dog corrinunded a
lor afarrcntion at rhe meeting. "There weren't many quesrions [at the meeting]
and I wondered afterwards if rhe clog had mesmerized people,"

Euan is described as "very urreerionare" and has even managed ro make a friend
during his shorr stay in Grinncll. an Airedsle Terrier that he visits every week.
according ro Osgood, Euanls hobbies inelude ”chasing ball: around.” playing oiire
doors despite the cold weather, end oteouree yusr heing ”frisky” and happy re
have been so well received by rhe rrudenre orcrinneli College.
