Artists-in—residence and Grinnell
dancers bring Active Space to life

When 1 was younger, 1 loved to go to the
science museum. The dinosaurs were a lug draw,
but the best thing was the staircase. 'l'hc stairs
were musical Each and every footfall elicited this

better, they were arranged from low notes .tt the
foot of the staircase to high irotes at the top.
Running up the starts, as herds of kids did on
every class ﬁeld trip, caused a rising scale io msll
up the stairs too. it was magical.

Grinncll dancers and performing artists have
recently been working with a similar, if much
more intricate, brand of magic. It’s called Active
Space and, according to Theatre Technical As.

The basic idea is to enable performers on a stage
to directly affect the sounds and images of the
stage environment through their movements

The technology consists of three main par i

software has three compoirents. The Very Ner.

grammed in beforehand. Finally, the various
audio and visual signals are sent to the appropri—

MIDI interface to create (h! actual environment

While 1 initially imagined that such a sys-

component.

The term “Active space" courts from the idea
of “activating a space.” says Naugle. The idea
originated, she said, over the summer of 1992.
She was attending a conference of artists who
were interested in explorllig the relationship be-
tween tethnology and art. It was there that she
met John Crawford, a software designer who had
begun to see the possibilities dance could hold
for furthering the development of technology

Since then, the technology involved in digi—
tal dance has advanced significantly in addi.

lust as much as the technological processes.
Naugle stresses the importance of the emotional
processcsofthedanctrs usingActiveSpace, one
ofher goals as a teacher, she said, is to help her
students feel better about their bodies and their
presence in the world. and to emphasize that ivc
humans are not iust passive recelversy but active
members ofthe world around us. Naugle said
that being in an environment like Active space
reinforces the importance ofdancers movements
and gestures, which also enforces selfesteem.
The impact of movement on the environment
tells the dancer “my gesture was meaningrul,"
Naugle said. She also emphasizes the role ofAc»
rive Space as a new mode ofcvpression, one that
affects dancers even as they afrect it, “Technol—
ogyeoupled with imagination pushes you to new
levels oresptessivity," she said.

Another emotional effect of using the Arc
rive Space was noted by Dante Troupe advisot
Teresa l-lcilaird. She noticed the inhibition the
dancers experienced in Active Space. Normally,
she said, improvisation is fairly stressful in this
Context, though. “itwas more likea toy," Hcilaiid

Scholar speaks on afﬁrmatlve action

Professorjenlufer Pierce ofthe University ofMinc
nesora gave her presentation “Racing for innocence
Wluteness, Corporate Culture, and the Backlash
Against Afﬁrmative Action," to a full house on the
night of February 27 if many more students or pro-
fessors had tried to attend the presentation, which was
held in ARH 302. they might noi have found an open
seat

The interest of both raculty and students was
piqued by Picrce‘s 20 minute talk, which addressed
the racial rcrrsiorrs ofemployces iii a large corporate
law firm and the role ofaffii-mative action in todays
workplaces The tulc, Pier-ccexplainsd, came from air
interview with air African—American attorney work-
ing at a predominantly white firm. According to
Pierce, the attorney described his white cn-worken as
“racing" to deny their accountability for the syslcm»
atic discrimination facing minority members in the
corporate workplace.

in her inter-views oieorporate attorneys in this pare
tlcular law ﬁlm, which Pierce called “BC Law Firm,"
she discovered several disturbing trends ln the relac

tions among employees. The ﬁrm had instituted a court.
ordered affirmative action program after being sued for
discrimination. Many or the white employees viewed
the minority lawyers hired under the program as ”unc
qualified,"de - he fact tlratsome orthem hadgmdu»

thermore. l’iclce said, most orihe attoiireys wlro were
parirciilarlyciitieal oftlrc minority presence in the ﬁrm
were wellcestahlixlted lawyers who would irot have been
in direct competition with airy employees hired as a
result ofthe afﬁrmative action program

Among the white attorneys, Pierce also found wide
spread negativity regarding the personalities ofthe Aft
ricau American lawy s lhe minority attorneys were
seeir .ts “"deirianding, abrasive and is having cashed
in" on the employment opportunities mandated under
arlitiriativc action. The same lawyer who coined the
phiase "racing for innocence” also described his co.
workers as actiirg extremely defensive whenever he tonc
fronted them about their behavior

In the lengthy question and answersession.students
and facultycxplorcd the idea of”rnclng for innocence."
soareqiiestioired thelegitimacyofthe“innocence," pro.
posing that it was drlven by more than simple oblivi.

ousiress, and possibly by a very educated and racist
agenda, Pierce also observed that while members of
previous generations may have been described as
openly and clearly racist, the present generation has
given rise to a more coded, and covertly hostile envic
rorrment,

pierce also noted that she has seen the backlash
against affirmative action grow stronger in recent years.
She expressed concern over how perceptions regard.
ing affirmative action can be changed in a climate
where incidents ofprejtidice are often seen as isol ited,
rather than as ongoing racism

The talk was, both in terms ofattendarrce and feedc
back, highly sutc sful. “it was a fantastic turnout,"
said Susan Ferguson, .osociate professor orsotiology,
who encouraged professors to make announcements
iii theitclasses regarding the talk, While many profes-
sors invited their classes to attend rew were required
it. Ferguson attributes the topics popularity to its pei.
vasiveness in many areas, including sociology, Americ
can studies, and Africans studies. Pictce's presenta—
tion was part ofthe Sociology Roberts Lectures and
was sponsored jointly by the sociology department
and the Wilson program.
