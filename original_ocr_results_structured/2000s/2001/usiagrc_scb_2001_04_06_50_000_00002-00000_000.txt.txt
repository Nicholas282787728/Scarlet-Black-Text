ted rapper Shawn “Puffy" Combs, Grlnt
nell College president Russell K, Osgood

hasdropped his longrime“Rusty K” nick. .

“it was just time for a change,"
Osgood said. “I feel the ‘Russ Diddy‘

administrative salaries.

“The ‘R—Diddy’ name is a symbol

science building

The Grinnell College Board orl‘rustt
ees voted in an emergency session yestert
day to auction off the Noyce science
Center to compensate for the deprecla»
tion ofrhe endowment that has followed
in the wake of plummeting stock prices,

“We didn’t want to have to do this,"
board president Caroline Little said, “but
we see no other viable option to save our
endowment."

The auction was not the only method
suggested for bringing in hands suggested
at the meeting. other options included
a bake sale, a car wash and an alltyou»
anteat chili fundtialser,

“Wt- looked at these other options,
but they did not have the viability of the
Noyce auction," Little said. “i mean, rc-
ally, who, will buy a plate ofcookrcs for
$500,000?”

several parties, including the
Dagorliir swordfighring club, Coe Col-

Football player lost for two
dayspn South Campus

When cornerback Mike Wilson '01,
missed a football team meeting last week,
his coaches knew something was wrong.

“lr‘syust not like Mike to miss a meet-
ing," coach RustyThompson said. “We
knew something bad had happened, like
kidnappingorspontsneouseombustion.”

Nothing so dire had happened to
Wilson; instead, he had wandered onto
South Campus and gotten lost in the tin.
familiar territory.

“Dude, l crossed 81h Ave; and it tvas
like a whole different world. i was wan.
dering forseven oreight hours lost in the
stairway of some boost place," Wilson
said.

Wilson was helped back to his native
North campus by a fricndiy Quad
worker, who knew something was amiss
when she spotted the football playcrloade

Stupid bastard applauds tu~

Norris resident and geneml asshole
Paul Mathew told reporters that he wasn’t
especially upset about the ridiculously
large tuition lrike “Maybe the one bil-
lion dollarcndowment and $25,000 from
each and every student just isn't enough

for the administration to get by on. i
don't mind giving a little extra." Mathew
went on to Explain that his rich Daddy
was going to take up thesiack. "After all,"
the fuekhead said, “what’s another
32,000?" Mathew responded to our fur-
ther prodding by yowling, “hey, stop
tharl" and trying to defend himself.

Coke now coming out of the

faucets, showerheads

“My eyes!" screamed yunior Emily
Hoover as she leap out of the shower
elutehing her face. She is one ofme many
studene who are upset that the eampus
water has been replaced by Coke in act
cordance with the new contract. “Not
only is brushing my teeth oounter pron
ducrive now," grumbled first—year lane
Hackert, “but noiv i am having trouble
enioying the liquid as a beverage." stu
dents have also reported having trouble
with other things, like washing clothes.
“all I know is that my water heater is
making runny noises," whined Hoover,
“They could have at least made it Diet,"
she sighed

Words “dove, glove,”
“above,” don't really be-
long in this sonnet, says
professor

'l'ousled, lovable Lyric professor
Michael Cavanagh gave a student a poor
mark dais week fora poem urat Cavanagh
says “really put a strain on dae language
in order to include those words“ and
“deﬁnitely included gratuitous use ofthe
phrase “hand in glove

“It's not like this is a new problem
forstudtnts," Cavanagh explained “It's
just that l couldn’t take it any more, it's
like that “again' thing. l/rrte that."

The student, Bill Williams ‘01, eit-
pressed appropriate anguish, “I wanted
to do well for MC," he sobhed during an
interviewwitli the 503. “He's so touslea,
and lovable. And I would have stic-
ceeded, too, if it weren't for that damn
Pcrrarchan sonnet and its draconian
rhyme scheme!"

Grinnell professor and linguistic
scholar Eliubeth Dohhs thinks Williams
is taking this too personally. “The fault,
Mr Williams, lies not in ourselves but in
a larger soci linguistiestrtteture," she CX-
plaincd to him. “Due to the hybrid mt-
ture ofrhc modern English language, rot
suiting as it does from the elass.tinged
ll“ century inrermingling of French»
speaking Germanic nobility with Saxon
arid Briton serfs, our tongue simply
doesn't offer the numbing uniformity of
sound called for by the traditions of our
Lntlntbased cultuial predtcmsors, Perv
haps you should experiment with the
newer, rrendier Shakdpearean sonnet in
future efforts."

A fellow Lyriesnident,Tom Eliot '04,
said Williams’s poem made a more basic
mistake. “only dweebs use rhymes any»
more," he explained, “This is stupid stuff.
It comes offas so, like, hollow, man."

Grinnell to change name to
”Garleton"

In anothererforr to “stay competitive
with our peer institutions" the Grinnell
administration announced that the
school would have to go through “a few
more changes." The biggest of these
changes involves the college switching
names to “Carleton," When questioned
about this decision, trustee Robert Wells
explained that changing names is not a
new idea: “Why do you think Grinnell
changed its name from Iowa College to
Grinnell in the first place? It wasn't be
cause ofsome guy, we were Just trying to
get an edge on Cornell." otherchanges
that the school administration is looking
into include moving the college to Min-
nesota, forcing the students to wear cargo
pants and baseball hats, and ﬂanking
Carleton on all sides and attacking on
Ch ristrnas morning.

Ifstudents do not like these sugges-
tions, “Gamiasrer” is also being consid-
ered.

Diversity problem tackled by

attempt at recruiting a diverse student
body faculty, and staff, the college ad
ministration developed a new, lame pro

commented Frank Thomas, "we have
kids coming in from all over: Minnesota,
Michigan, Wisconsin, Missouri,
Nebraska...the list goes on and on until
I've mentioned all of the Midwestern
states “ This program. dubbed the Difr
ferent shades of Bloiidc Program is de.
signed to attract people from all over the
upper middle United states. These slut
dents will also have a variety of religious
backgrounds. “ We're bringing in Prote
estants, Congregationalisrs, Methodist,
Unitarians, Lutherans, . .but mostly prote
estants," Thomas was also very excited
about a brunettestudent coming in from
Ohio- “Ohio? he said, “That’s practically
