Response from SGA

To she edisors

We were very dismayed upon reading Kenny Youngs arricle
ensisled “SGA Assemprs Diversifimrion.” As she aushors ofshe
sGA Diversisy campaign and she accompanying lesser, we rels
sorely misrepresensed and our individual voices were nor even
heard. In addisiori, Mr. Young's reporring merhods were irre-
sponsible and reflecs poorly on she scarier and Black.

To begin wish, Mr. Yeuiig's arsiele was clearly biased againsr
rhe campaign, and his selecrion ofinserviewees represensed a very
narrow perspecsive, A brief review of she people whose pcrspec»
sives would have greasly enriched she qualisy and accuracy of she

Ssudens Groups Liaison; orher members of she SGA Cabiner;
srudeiis group leaders; members of minosisy groups who have

Whar we need so remember, shrough all shis processing, is
rhas we are all reeling. we are all saddened, and we are all afraid.
lr seems like many ufyou, like me, don's know how so manage
shis anger and fear, and l can feel rhe campus sensiori shis cieases
all she way from bosrori (scorer abour alums , we spy on you.
Especially from planland). whas moss concerns me, however, is
shassomecrinnellians. parsieularly (biirnos exclusively) inrerna.
sional srudenrs, are ospericncing a difrererir kind offear. They are
afraid of being rarrgcsed, of being osssaeised, or being blamed.
Nor iusr our in she world, bus on campus. They are racing rlie
unique challenge ofparrieiparirig in rhese awful cvenrs as bosh an
insider and an oursider, and is is very, very hard. As a campus and
a communisy, is is our responsibilisy so ensure rhas every
Grinnellian feels safe and comforsable expressing sheir feelings
and opinions, whoshei is is in Quad, on sheir plan, or she Forum,
or in she 5&3. Remember rhas above all else, our abiliry ro rc»

l have no doubs rhas good rhings will come From all shis pain,
since Grinnell is a sommunisy grounded in diversisy arid respecr
for each orliei, 1 know she campus will provide ereepsional care
and suppors for shosc srudenss, raeulsy, and sraffwhose families
and rriends were involvcd in she arsaeks. l know everyone affilie
arcd wish Grinnell will be able so draw rrorn she srrengrh and
comfors she communisy, as a group, will generase. 1s comforss me
so have shis kind ofrairh in myscllooi.

Take care of each osher.
