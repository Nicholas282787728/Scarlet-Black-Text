Athletes forget how to talk the trash rout

When I rad an arriclc in rhc onlinc edition of my hometown
neivspaper about a young football player swearing ar e ooach,1kncw
something was gravely wrong with sporis.

The article iold ora high school football playerwho, after a close
win over a crossrown rival, looked die opposing coach
square in the eye and said, “we kicked your ass."

Tin sure this report caused guirc a srir in my
little Nebraska homerowii. Having worked for the
local newspaper ihioughoiir my high school years,

T know prinriog ”ass" in an issue is on par

with printing things like “[ hare corn"
and “I supporr gay righrs." 1 can
imagine letters ro rlie odiror pouring ,
in written by people who wriro “ass"
like 3","

The ariiclc stirred oinoiions in me, recs. I didnr mind the “ass"
pair—lye already said “:55" five times in this column. Whar really
borlrcicd inc is the downfall ofspoirs signaled by ibis young man’s
commcnr, i'in not talking about rho uricrlock ofsporrsmanrhrp the
player displayed; I’m talking abour the orfoll trash talking.

Tnlkrng trash is an essential part ofsporrs, sports experts like
psychologists and rhai annoying drunk giiy who always rirs behind
you in rho srnnds or home football games say rlror pinyiriganysport is
as much a mental ncriviiy as it is n physical one. Trash mlklng, rlrcn,

two balls, no 'strikes

is as important an activity as running, throwing, kicking and cheer.
in ,

g When done correctly, crash talking can demoralize opponents. 1r
can make a lineman miss his block bcuus: he’s thinking about wlrar
you iusr said about his mama. it can make a forward miss a kcyfrce
throw because she’s too busy worrying abour all rhe smack you're
planning to lay down on her,

Unfoiiuiiarcly, rrash talking is clearly becoming a lost arr, Telling
a coach nhor rho game you kicked any part ofhis anatomy is nor the
proper way to talk trash. Today's young athletes need its learn how to
ralk better smack.

Tho firsr lesson they need to be
taught is char [rash ralking is not
moanr ro insult an opponent per se;
ir"s meonr io ihrow him orrhis game.

For example, rolling on opponcnr he's far isn'r going to do any goudi
it wont break his coiiccniraiion. Telling an opponent he'd look mnrr
velous in your mother's wedding dress will. crcotiviry is rho key to
trash rnlking MuhninmadAli didn’t move fasrnnd hit good. he floored
like a burierny and siuiig like a bee.

Cronrivo trash inlkiiig can take many forms. Back in my days of
playing catcher in pccwcc baseball, i thought of inysclfns the most
ciciiivo [nsh tailor our ilrcrc instead of bnigging up my skills or
cloivnpliying my opponents, 1 rank the silent approach, choosing

nicholos johhsori

not to say a word when 1 was behind the plate. some sayl was just
mock, bur 1 know rhar my silence would raidc rho batter more than
muttered accusations that he was adopted. 1 also knew char the barter
had a big moral bar, and more was no way i was going to start chzt»
coring while he was holding that thing.

unlike The asyluclung football player, i also knew that there was
a proper time and place for trash talking. My preferred time and
place was never and nowhere, but bolder talkers orirash know when
and where to sound off. one good rulcorihumb is nor to talk rrosh
around rcporrcrs who can overhear you and wrire about you in the
paper

Whats most disheartening aboui ihe cllrrcm snr: ofrrosh mikv
ing is how unnecessary iis demise is. Trash talking resources are cir—
crywhere. even on ihc Web, My quick search for “Trash talking" on
the lnrcruci revealed dozens ofwebsircs that reach you how to rnlk
trash. There were sircs with spormpcciﬁ: trash talk, sires that ler you
rare your trash cilkiug skills and even a Japanese trash talking siro.
l‘m not sure ofevciyrhing that LEI site said, brrr I’m prerry sure 1 can
talk aboui your mom in ai lonsr one other language now.

I can only hope Tin wrong and good trash ralkiiig isn'r guicldy
disappearing. Some may cut trash talking unsporismonliko and me
sulring. i think it‘s a necessary part orcompeiuive sports.

And besides, those who dont like crash rrlkingwould look mar»
ircloirs in my mothers \vcddlng dress.
