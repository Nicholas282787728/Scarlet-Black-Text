 

Central Park is family-oriented

BY CAuoLlN SCHOLZ

Located right in the middle of downtown Grinnell at the corner of 4th Avenue and
Broad Street, Central Park has a wonderful family atmosphere. The park isn't big, but it's
big enough to take a little detour while on a stroll through the town. The park seems to
attract mainly families and children, as evidenced by a kid's bike that was left in the gazebo,
which stands in the center otthe patk. Given the number ofswings at the park’s playground,
the family feel comes as no surprise. In part due to its location in the middle of downtown
Grinnell, the persistent trafﬁc noise makes it a little hard to just relax in the shade while
catching up on some reading. Overall, it is a nice park, in good shape, but other than families
and the occasional dogrwalker, not many people seem to frequent the park,

many visitors, the parks manunade lake,

bass, catﬁsh and more, while boaters can
