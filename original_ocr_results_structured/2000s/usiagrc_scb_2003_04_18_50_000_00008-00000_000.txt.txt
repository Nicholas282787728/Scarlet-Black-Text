by Leslie Boyadjian

This is the [Ime or year when student creativity runs
rampant; one product ofthe outburst ofartistic endeavors
is the annual 'l‘Itulat Held Film festival. Seventeen films
were submitted this year and 16 of these are up for the
unique awards, such 3 a baby doll head, an image ofa

clude a ﬁght ﬁlm. a romance. a music video, a horror fdm,
a documentary, a star wars remake, and lots of cameos
and appearances by mmpus celebrities including Riosoll
Osgood, Darcy, Russ Motta, Lyle Bauman, sieve Larson,
and several professors.

Titular Head began as a Ellen!
show as the ﬁnal event of Relays
weekend over 25 years ago. Back
then the event consisted of perforc
nrances in Darby Gym for a ptncl
offour profcssots, chswcrc present
and studentwould express their dist
approval ofskiis in an unusual way.

“It involved the actual chuclo ng
of beers," said Adam Portilla ’03,
“which unfortunately we don't have
at recent Titular Heads."

NoncLhelt‘ss, studcns continue to submit ﬁlms and
attend the festival; in fact, the tickers forTitular Head sold
out in less than a day.

David Whitwmb '03 submitted 2 film for the third
year in a row. “It’s so much fun to make [a ﬁlm]," said
Whitconrb “Titular Head is probably my favorito cvent
of the year, It's better than Disco lt's hotter than soccer
Ball."

Whitcomb's ﬁlm is a sequel to his ﬁrst ’l‘itular Head
ﬁlm, which was about racquetball “Racquetball Hustle"
was shown at the 2001 Titulat Head This year's ﬁlm fea-
turcs cameos by various high proﬁle campus ﬁgures, al-
though Whitcomb would not say whom.

I think people like campus references," said

“Titular Head is probably
my favorite event of the
year. It’s better than Disco.
It's better than Soccer
Ball."

mg to be more impressive than in years past.

“The quality is going to he so much better," said
whitcomb. students this year had acctss to better equip.
menr like digital cameras for the ﬁlming, as well as editing
equipment that made the ﬁnal product impressive.

jeremy Blodgett '03 and hem Simons '03 were able to
check out equipment from the Av center and ﬁlmod their
entry using digital video, “mini D.V.." as well as external
microphones. Additionally they used the editing software
in the AV ccntcr,

“[Wc played] around with moving stuft half a second
in one direction, halra second in the other direction until
it was right," said Simom.

blodgttt made two movies this
year with two very different themes.
“Ioneofthefrlmsl is astorytlre nu.
thence will be into, but [its] irot the
typicrl crowd pleaser." said blodgott
about the film he made and simons.
“My other ﬁlm is the typical crowd
pleasct."

“[lt's] a documentary with a
musicvidco feel," said Simons about
Blodgett’s second ﬁlm.

While it was a great deal ofwork
Blodgett enjoyed making the two distinct ﬁlms, “I feel that
both of these movies really needed to he made and Titular
Head is the forum [for that] he said with an air otmotlt
dignity “I nccd a cigarette."

Blodgott and Simons were not the only ones who had
to put a great deal otenergv into the ﬁlming and editing
process. \vhitcomh said that it took around 20 hours to
film and 40 hours to edit this year, Mark Gardiner '05, Per
ianson '03 .rnd johanna Marvel '05 also put rortli great
efforts in editing, smoothing transitions between scenes
and coordinating musical ciics,

Editing their ﬁlm was not an easy process; Gardiner
even ventured to (afrectionatcly) refer to his cohorts as

from Adam Portilla ‘05, who madc his own Titular Head
film and was also a member of Gardiner, janson. and
Marvel's cast. The two groups worked togcdier, even shat»
ing iast like Lara lanson ‘05.

The Titular Head ﬁlm festival is an opportunity for
students like Lara to shine, showing oirsoctet talents.

“There was a tall for stupid human tricks' and 1 had
one," said Lara, “Basically i did crazy back tricks in
[Gardiner Jonson, and Msrvcl'sl movie."

Lara also had tho chance to stand in |l1e middle of the
street wearing a black sheet one Saturday night 3 a part of
Portilla's ﬁlm.

“High school kids would drive by and say ‘that’s so
dark man,” said lam.

The experience was made even more unusual by Pet's
role. Pet's running around in about 90 percent of the
movi , .aidIJOrtilln.

Lara's strange experience is not unusutl in the ﬁlm
making process. Ben Hancs

‘New twist’ on Monologues

This year, The Vagina Monologues combines Eve Ensler’s play with vignettes written by students at Grinnell

by Eva Constantaras

This year's staged mdingm of The VAA
grna Marmbguer will feature “a new twist
on an old szOIch." said Betsey Blanche Y05,
coordinatorofthis yiair’s presentation. The
twist? The Magma Mrmolaguzr are going to
get personal.

Getting more personal than vaginas
might seem an impossible fear, but this
years inst has risen to the ocusion. on
April 20 anle at9 pm. in Main Lounge.
the cast will not only present Eve
Ensler‘s famous version of The Vagina
Manobgw: but also Grinnell Vagina
Monologues, written by Grinnell stu.
dents.

“By. . .adding new monologues it’s
impossible to forget that these women
are real women, not justactors, said
Blanche. The experience ofbeing a
woman and having a vagina is some
thing that is both dimcult to explain
and, at times. uncomfortable to even
bring up."

Blanche explained that beanie women
“rarely have an opportunity to talk about
[vaginas] or hear about them," it is impure
tant (in! the audience fccls comfortable. A
high comfort level is much more likely with
fellow classmates revealing their own
thoughc and feelings on the subject along
side the prcsentztions of the published. and
also very powerful, monologues.

When Blandie approached the rest or
the Feminist Action Coalition, the spon-
sor of the event, requesting volunteers to

“By...adding new mono-
logues it's impossible to
forget that these women
are ‘real’ women, not just
actors.”

—Bettey Blanche ‘05

write their own monologues, Elisa McCool
’06 and Alice Haltiwanger '05 overcame
their fear and agreed to give it a try. Al-
though Mccool “ﬁgured it was going to
tolte bravery" as neither woman had ever
performed in the Monologues. they shared
Blanche: sentiments about the importance
about making the monologucsspeak to stu.
dents on mmpus in a more personal my.
Another rcison the two wanted to write
their own monologues, according to
Hiring
was to
c x .

s u b c
j e c t s
t h e y
feel the
p u b .

logues
neglect but that “lots offemalcs can relate
to." Furthermore, both women had very
personal masons to take up the challenge
and write about the subjects they did, rea.
sons that are revealed in their monologues.
Haltiwangers piece, eniitled “roost,"
begins by identifying the two connotations
the title takes on in reference to vaginas.
thcn relates those deﬁnitions to
Haltiwanger's own experience. she explores
how girls deal with accusations of promis.
ciiityand the idea that “good girls dorirslccp
around and some guys want girls to be

tight" as well as how “as a female you are
either classified as a prudc or a slut."

Haltiwangcr's monologue tracts hot
personal struggle to rise above societys la.
bcls cod reconcile with her own tamily's
traditional moral ideas nboutscr. Sheavene
iinily arrives at the conclusion that "you
have to decide that you don't care what
people all you...You have to make your
own decisions as far as Sex goes."
Haltiwangcr chose this topic and message
because its “something lots of girls think
about but don't talk about," and bcuuse it
had a cathartic eirect on her own psyche.

McCool also chose to contribute her
own monologue, “VaginaEduation,” par»
tially for herselfand also to address issua
that she feelsare relevant to a lot ofwomen.
Her monologue follows her life from when
she got her first period to when she feels
she reached sexual maturity. A map ofher
vagina, visually depicting journey from
childhood to adulthood, accompanies
McCaol’s monologre. The focus of her
monologue is gitls' sexual education and
where the iniormation, or lack thereof,
comes from and how it impacts grrIs’ de
velopment.

Mccool decribcs her own confusion
ofhaving a period that loted two months
while she was in elementary school; the
prevalent attitude was to “hush this up and
lteep it quiet McCool feels this is just one
symptom orthe general neglect oftheedu»
cation ofgirls about sexual subjects, paint»

ingout that many girlsdontiarow drat they
can have orgasms until they have reached
scxual maturity.

“Patents dont tell their children what
their parts are and that could be detrimen.
nil.” said McCool. “All girls growing up havc
questions about their period.“ Everything
concerningsoiis leftasone big mystery for
girls even though “everyone has that awk—
ward time in their lives." McCool feels that
guidance andobtsiningcorroct information
about “how the vagina works" is essential
during this awkward stage.

Mccool is sure that many Grinnellions
have found themselves confused and um
sure and hopes that by “relating my expert
ence to other people itwill make rhemcom.
fornble enough to relate theirs."

Blanche is pleased with the results.
Haltiwanger and Mccool "blended per.
sonal experienaewirh misconceptionsabout
women and vaginas," said Blanche. “[They]
do a good job of talking about things not
included in EvcEnslet’s Vagina Monologues
to make their own unique and even more
personal."

Blanche thinks the experiment should
continue and hopes to see more student
involvement from boih tamaics and males
in the form ofboth vagina and penis mono-
logues. “The original monologuos aroaniat.
ing," she said. “butt think there’s a lot more
to be said and I feel that many £160le
men and women~at Grinnell are willing
to say it."
