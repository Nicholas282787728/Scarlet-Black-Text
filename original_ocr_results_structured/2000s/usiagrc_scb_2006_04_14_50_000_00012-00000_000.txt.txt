Grinnell is the team to beat
as conference app

5v LOLA GARCIA

The men's tennis Pioneers had a busy but SUCCCSS’
hi1 weekend last week. The team kept up a winning
streak in three matches ovei the two days.

Simpson foil to the Pioneers 7-0 on Saturday,
which Grinnell turned into another pair of back-to-
back victories by shutting down Central College, 7s0.
Both matches were at Central in Fella, Iowa.

Last Sunday, Grinnell took on the Augustana
Vikings at home. Grinnell took the match 6-1 with
Augustaua athlete Torn Gnoebel's defeat ofNate Fox
‘09 in the numberrtwo position the only norrPionecr
victoiy of the weekend in singles play.

“We're finally getting to the heart of the season
and pcoplc are starting to realized their potential on
the court," said Eric Ohrn ’07, who along with dou-
bles paitner Jordan Lee ’08 came away with victories
against both Cential and Simpson.

These most recent victolles and Grinnell’s win—
ning season tip to this point make continued success
against Midwest and Iowa Conference teams scent
assured.

"1 think we have a really good chance ofwinning
the rest of our matches, but we realize we have kind
ofa target on our backs," said Ohm. “There are teams
thatwe have had histoiical rivalries with, and whether
they've played good tennis all season or not are really
going to bring it against US. Even if the other teams
aren't as talented as us there's an emotional force that
[makes the matches for them] more important."

After an imprcssive weekend of play, the Midwest
Conference also named senior-captainjulian West’Ob
as the Midwest Conference Performer ofthe Week.

The league office recognized West’s perfect sine
gles play, as the Dccomh, Iowa, native helped pace the
Pioneers to its three team victories over the weekend.

“When I saw that I had been named Midwest
Conference Performer of the Week, I felt glad that
Grinnell is getting the attention it deserves in the
Midwest Conference," said West.

“We’re excited that people in the Midwest Cons
ference recognized Julian’s strong play last weekend,"

their matches in mole convincing fashion as Julian."

West started his weekend with a No. 1 singles vic—
tory (6st, eel) over Simpson’s top player and followed
that performance with No. 3 singles wins against
Cential and Augustana.

West, who teamed with Eli Best to win the duo's
only doubles match ofthe weekend, improved to 16-5
iii singles play this season.

Hamilton said thatJiiliaii would be an important
asset in conference competition.

“He has been a backbone on our team, which has
won backstorback Midwest.Conference Champion-
ships and is shooting for its third straight."

This weekend the men‘s team will head to Wis—
consin to face conference match-ups against Ripon on

said Coach Andy Hamilton. “No one our team won

Softball has a lot to

The Grinnell College softball team
is on a roll, keeping up their strong
performance on the road and winning
three of the five games it played at the
Midwest Crossover Tournament last
weekend.

The Pioneers picked up three wins
on Saturday against st. Norbert, Beloit
and Carroll.

on Sunday, the team lost its first
contest 20 to Lawrence and later fell
to Ripon by a score of5sl.

The conference tournament was
.Grinnell's only opportunity this year to
face off against teams from the North
Division of the Midwest Conference,
so it was important for Head Coach
Tom sonnichson and his team to play
‘well right away and get a solid start
within the conference.

“I felt we played great defense on
Saturday and against Beloit and Carroll
our offense was vcry productive,” said
Sonnichson. “Sunday was a different
story Sandra King ’03 pitchcd a good
game against Lawrence and we hit the
ball hard, but right at their fielders.
Against Ripon, we made physical errors
and, most importantly, mental errors."

The pitching was certainly a strong
point during Grinnell’s trip north. All
three of the victories for the Pioneers at
the tournament were shutouts.

In a 1-0 contest against St. Norbert,
Gaby Flores '09 picked up the win and
King earned the save. Lee Anne Stein-
berg ’07 pitched a complete game shut-
out in a 7-0 win against Beloit and Tess
Cohen '09 repeated the feat against

Carroll, shutting them out 9s0.

“On Saturday I feel that we went
out with something to prove. We had
been ranked ninth out of 10 teams in
the conference and we knew that we
didn’t deserve that ranking,"st Steins
bcrg. “Our defense was really solid and
our bats came through. Our pitchers
shut out all three teams on Saturday
All around, we played like real pros."

The offense that was present on
Saturday simply was not there for

coach sonnichson on Sunday against
Lawrence and Ripon.

On Saturday, the Grinnell offense
put up 17 runs on 17 hits. They also
had a good eye at the plate, coaxing 11
walks from the opposition.

In their two games on Sunday, the
Pioneer offense managed 11 hits and
three walks, but was only able to plate
one run in 14 innings.

“There was a remarkable change
from Saturday to Sunday," said Stein-

prove

berg. “Our offense did not come
through as it had the day before and we
made a couple of mental errors. Men—
tully, we were just not thcrc the second
day. we were passive.“

The softball team found its spire
it again for the doubleheader last
Wednesday against Cornell Colicgc.

The Pioneeis split the two gantcs,
winning the first and dropping the
second, but their played much more
consistently compared to their perfor-
malice last Sunday.

Grinnell shut out the Cornell Rams
in their first match, 5,0, securing the
victory with a monster grand slam off
the bat of freshman Darcy Ward at the
bottom of the fifth inning.

The Pioneers lost the second con-
test by only one run after battling back
from a 2-0 deficit halfway through the
fifth inning to tie Cornell 3-3 before
falling +3 at the end ofthe seventh in-
hing.

The Pioneers hit the road again this
weekend, traveling to Knox for a done
bleheader on Friday and to Lake Forest
for a doubleheader on Saturday.

This will be the team's first look at
conference teams from the South Divir
sion, and Sonnichson and his team will
look for his pitching staff and offense
to step up.

“If we can reach a consistent level
of performance against each opponent
on our schedule then we can attempt
to elevate it against MWC opponents"
said sonnichson. “1 think that in trying
to be consistent, it takes the pressure off
the ‘big gamc’ owac play."
