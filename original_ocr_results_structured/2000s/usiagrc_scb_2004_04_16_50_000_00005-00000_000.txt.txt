Memories of the massacre

On February 13, 1982, Dominga’s tarhcr went ro rhe marker and
never returned. He and 70 other men in Rio Negro were massacred by
rho Guatemalan Army and pammilitnry soldiers.

One month later, when Dominga was nine years old, Guatemalan
soldiers bargcd inro hcr tarnily‘s home and srarred rorruring her mother.
Wanting to prorocr her children, Domingn's mother srrapped her young.
esr daughter to Dominga's back and told Dominga ro run as at away
as possible. That was the last time Dominga ever saw her mother alive.

Domingo ran into the mounrarns to hide. She squeezed berry iuice
into her sister’s mouth to try to keep her alive but her sister died.
Dominga wandered in rhe wilderness for over rwo weeks.

“I was so hungry that rhcre was days when i wouldn’t get up be—
cause I was weak," said Becker.

Her relatives round herand smuggled herro an orphanage in Giiav
temala City ro prevent her from being killed. After two years in rhe
orphanage, Dominga was adopred by a family from Algona. The tam.
ily knew ncirhcr Spanish nor Achi, Dorrunga's native language. They
did nor know that Dominga was a survivor ofrhe Rio Negro massacre
and Dominga‘s arrempts to communicare memories ther life in Guar
remala were misunderstood and cvcnrually suppressed.

“I‘d sit at home crying, and they would hold me and comfort me,
but rhey couldn't understand why I was crying," Becker said or her
adoprive parcnrs.

Domingn's peers at her small Algona elementary school ridiculed
her crhniciry and inability to speak English, Her second grade class-
mates hurled racial slurs at her and disbelieved her when she tried to
rcll'her srory.

Dominga slowly adjusted to living in Algona. she was renamed
Dcncse Joy Becker, She learned to speak English. She excelled in school,
went on to James Mason College where she obtained a degree in cos—
metology and later married and had children.

But she cominued to have nighrmnres abour rhe massacres and
wondered irher memories were real or imagined. Her adoprive cousin

Becker began researching rhe massacres. another survivor called ro say

rhe help ofhcr Guatemalan relnrlvcs and rhe local Algona eommuniry,
Becker raised $2000 for rhe rrip. “I just wamcd ro step on the land, no
complete my memories, to make sure rhar I was nor insane," she said.

Completing memories

her home, the people and landscape orrbe Rabinal rescrrlcmenr com»

children dressed in Mayan clothing and all i could sea was me as a
little child and my mother," she said,

A sea of relatives and community members surrounded Becker to
greet her. Tears streaked the faces ofsonre older women who remem-
bered Dominga‘s childhood and had lived for years uncertain of her
whereabours, or oven whether she was still alive.

Rio Negro village. ”there are people that have moved into
Rio Negro and pretty much live in stick houses hanging on
the side or the mountains,” she said.

Due to the possibility of arson, Becker advocates the
construction or new homes that would be "harder to burn.”
She plans to promote the education or Achi children by
