Students
essential

Staying mentally healthy at Grinnell is '

challenging. It’s a great place to receive
an education, to experience living in rural
America, and to experiment intellectually
(and otherwise, wink, wink). But a place
to overcome emodonal trials, Grinnell is

not. The students are isolated, under in- .

tense pressure and in a socially claustro-
phobic environment. Adding depression,
anxiety or other disorders to this brew can
be almost too much; in certain cases, it is
too much.

Such was the experience for at least
three of my fellow Gnnnellians four years
ago. Jonathan, Lenko and Amy's suicides
drew stark attention to the students who
were falling through the cracks, with the
illness of depression compounding our
shared pressures. The school reacted as
well as they could have,1 suppose. Putting
pressure on the county mental health cenr
ter to take on more of our load and having
counseling awilable at the Health Center.

But the most amazing development
that spring was not the result of an instir
tubional effort. We, the students, worked
hard to keep an eye out for each other.

Perhaps not everyone was sincere, and.

maybe not every student felt the concern
and fellowship that grew out of those crag—
edies. But I felt it, and] tried to commu-
nicate it to everyone. I was lucky, though.
I had some very, very good friends 7 as
close as family or closer. I had a network
of support, and even though I wasn’t al—
ways aware of it, my friends and 1 took
very good care of each other.

Two years removed from my under
grad life, I don't have much to say about
how the administration is continuing to
care for the students' mental health. I
hope they are doing everything in their

I desperately hope the students are
ing to look out for one another.

But if I could oFfer some insight
from beyond that handshake with the
be—blinged Russell K: the post Grinnell
transition is not easy. I moved to Chicago,
and I am surrounded by 3 million city
residents, under hardly any pressure, and
have been (at times) so socially alone it
hurts. I’m in the opposite situation from
a current Grinnellian, and it can feel very
remote,

In talking with my friends, many now
living across the continent, this has been a
very common theme. We’ve all dealt with
it in our own way, but for those of us who
struggle with depression, the new social
paradigm can be jarring and ultimately
dangerous.

Again, I have been lucky. I have de-
cenr health insurance, and loving and able
parents, both of whom subsidize my work
in therapy. I have an amazing therapisr (a
Grinnell alum, 1 might add), who I deeply
respect and with whom I genuinely cons
nect. Finally, not all my friends are far
away, some are physically near-by. And
I’m getting better at keeping the others at
least emononally nearby.

What I mean to say with all this is
that depression is not a Grinnell problem.
And it’s not an I-hate—my-job problem.
It's not an I’msunderssosmuchspressure
problem. And it’s not an I'm—not—chal—
lenged-enough problem. Depression is a
mcnrsll illness. It comes with us when we
go, and as much as we had to look out for
each other at Grinnell, we need to keep
on doing it. .

Mental Health Special

May 12, 2006

No clear answers to questions

one spring night in 2003,
shortly after Jonathan Raxtcr had
committed suicide, Kate Strangio
and I wrote an article about the
rememberance service that the
Stonewall Coalition held for him,
the fact that gay teens are more
likely to commit suicide and the
fact that Jonathandid not Corns
mire suicide "because he was gay.”
Four years later, I’m writing about
these issues again.

The college has changed
things for the better. The elimis
nation of mental health contracts,
the free visits to the Poweshiek
Mental Health Center and the
establishment of onscampus,
walkrin counseling show that the
college wants to take care of its
students’ mental health needs.

I think the campus culture
surrounding mental health fosters
openness, too. People can and do

talk about some issues, like de-
pression, openly and without fear
ofsrigma. In these ways, the cola
lcge community helps meet pEOT
ple’s needs fairly well.

A gay-orientated online news-
paper, 365gay.com, notes rhar the
suicide rate in gmy youth is three
times higher than in the normal
population. This is a common
ﬁgure. When Kate and I wrote
about Jonathan, we worried me
mots would circulate that " om,
than killed himselfbecause he was
gay” The situation with Jonathan
was far more complicated than
this.

A better way to phrase it: “be—
ing gay placed Jonathan under
certain kinds of strain that made
him more susceptible to depreSs
slon, mental illness and suicide."
A researcher at the University
of Minnesota did a comparative

study that agreed there was a link
between homosexuality and at—
tempting suicide but did not find
any kind of universal quantiﬁable
connection [http://www.yourh.
org/loco/PERSONProjcct/Rer
sources/ResearchSmdies /sui-
clch.html]. Young gay people
are in rroublciwc just don't know
how much trouble it is.

But if] lay aside the College’s
institutional changes and the sta-
tistics, what's left? I’ve seen bad
things happen here.

I know suicide attempts have
happened on campus since that
spring i watched a close friend
struggle with depression and suie
cidal tendencies for over a year
before finally making the deci-
sion to leave. I watched another
friend on a mental health cons
tract be sent home aginst her
will the same spring I wrote about

Jonathan Raxter. Did the college
handle their cases as it should
have? DidI treat them as a friend
should have? These are questions
I don’t know how to answer.

I know that our community
has done a lot of things to ad-
dress mental healrh concerns. I
know that the campus doesn’t do
enough about eating disorders,
cutting, anxiety and mental health
concerns resulting from sexual as
sault.

I hope Student Affairs is
working to make this a better
place for people with those con-
cerns. 1 hope the people reading
this article are working on this.
Most of all, I hope it doesn’t take
a rememberance service to involve
people in the ongoing discussion
about mental health that this
community needs.

Faculty affirms support

It is now four years since the Grinnell community lost two bright,
well-liked, but significantly troubled young men. While everything
fades with time, I know that many still feel the pain of their loss. For
some unclear reason, particularly since most of my collagues are sig
nificantly more articulate than I, the SEE has asked me to reﬂect on
what has changed since four years ago. (Perhaps it’s my parenthetical
writing style.)

There are many things that have not changed. Grinnell continues to
accept signiﬁcant numbers ofbrighr but troubled young people. Should
we stop doing so? 1 don't think so, These young adults should be able to
attend college, and I hope that we do a betterjob than large, imperson-
al, institutions at supporting them. However, accepting such students
means that we'll always have real worries about many students.

The final weeks of the semester continue to be a time of signiﬁcant
stress for nearly everyone on campus, students, faculty and staff alike.
(Yes, the highest level of stress is on the students.) I'm also not sure that
this is something that we can change.

Yes, I would prefer that students feel less stress at this point of the
semester, but I also know that for many classes, the most pedagogically
sound approach is to have work due at this time. (Unfortunately, there’s
also some evidence that ifthere is not signiﬁcantwork at the end ofthe
semester, students don’t make as much effort to learn the material that
comes at the end.)

Some of the stress that comes at the end of the semester continues
to be because many students lack appropriate organization and time
management skills. Often, the final papers, reports and presentations
that are due at this time are such that much of the work could have been
done in the preceding weeks.

However, it seems to be a Grinnell student tradition to wait until
the last possible minute. (As a worldsclass procrastinaror, I sympa-

thize.) Academic Advising continues to provide excellent support to
help students improve their organization and time management skills
andI hope that more students will use that support.

So, is anything different? It’s certainly much easier to get to the first
level of support. A few years ago, it often seemed quite difficult to get
a counselor quickly for a student who clearly needed counseling. Now,
walk-in services and an increased availability of appointments make
that task much easier. I realize that the student-counselor match is not
always excellent, but we have made signiﬁcant strides.

Followup referrals also seem much easier to get, and appointments
are made in a much better time frame. I very much appreciate the work
that Tom crady, his stattand the members ofPowesheik county Men-
tal Health have made in improving these services.

In the year immediately following the suicides, members of the
community were clearly much more open about admitting that they
were troubled and asking for help. We remain much better about tolk~
ing about depression than we were four years ago, although it does seem
rhar we've moved backwards somewhat from our most open point.

What else? I’m not sure whether it’s changed in the past four years
or not, but as I’ve said in the past, drinking to excess is clearly a current
problem on campus, and it certainly contributes to other problems, in—
cluding problems with depression (and problems with students ability
to complete work on time, which leads to more stress, and, in many
cases, more drinking). 1 hope we’ll fmd ways to address that problem.

one final thing remains the same: The faculty care deeply about the
welfare ofsrudents at Grinnell. We wouldn‘t choose to teach at a place
like Grinnell and we wouldn't spend the amount of effort we spend on
teaching and advising if we didn’t care about our students. I hope the
students reading this remember that.

Moving beyond just coping

l have lived with varying degrees of dcr
pression for over 10 years. However, 1 was not
conscious of my depression until last semester.
In middle school I was the fat, isolated, super-
srnarr kid. I found a way to cope with my doc
pression in seventh grade.

It was not a conscious decision. I began to
rationalize and objccufy everything in my life.
I became distanced, objective and neutral, alr
though I was never happy, capable of love or
felt passionate about anything, I was not sad
and thatwas better than dealing with my emo-
trons.

Three weeks before last semester ended,
I crashed. Hard. I cried for the first time in
over eight years. it was uncontrollable and (Cir
rifymg, I saw a counselor the next day. It was
wonlilcss'7hy the time I saw the counselor
I had recomposed myself and was guarded I
again convinced myseltthat 1 was fine,

For four days I was in ii state of shock. I

was completely devoid of.lll feeling and emo-
tion and did not care about anything, Looking
back, I was not “depressed."l was so down that
I could not feel anything, could not cry and
could not even think. I felt dead,

The Monday of finals week 17M throw
out some of my cutlery. That threw me over
the edge. Again, I cried for several hours.
Then I felt that same ccric calm void and was
indifferent to everything in my life.

But this time 1 ms not able to cover it up.I
began curring myself I needed to be reassured
that 1 was alive. Iconremplared suicide and
came up with elaborate plans. I was not able
to sleep for foul days and spent the time I was
not cutting or contemplating suicide staring
at a will, I went into rhc Health center again
that Friday.

The second time I was not able to hidc
behind my guarded rational obiccriviry and
l brokc down and cricd again. But 1 acnnlly

communicated with the psychologist, I felt a
lot better] left feeling dazed and confounded.

I went into Academic Affairs and met with
Joyce Stern, because for the first time in two
weeks I realized that school was over in just a
few hours and I still had a lot to do, I was not
granted an extension because my condition
was not deemed extenuating enough. So I said
to myself, “Fuck it,” went back to my room,
and cried some more.

I remained down for three weeks after
school ended. I was at least able to sleep. And
I did. For 14 hours a day, sometimes more.I
starred antidepressants when 1 got home and
evennnlly felt good enough to start function-
ing on a somewhat normal basis again. Now,
thankfully, I feel better than I have in years.I
have an entirely new outlook on life and I’m
learning to LIVE, I know not all stories end
happily, but mine has,
