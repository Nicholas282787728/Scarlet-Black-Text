It’s no lie:
Liars rock

While many Grinnell students view the
weekends as their best opportunity to ‘experi-
ment'in college, this upcoming Monday night
will offer students a new deﬁnition ofthc word
when the Liars and No Age, two experimental
bands, play at Gardener.

The Liars have been a mainstay ofthc indie
rock scene since their 2001 debut album 7722}!
Threw Us All in n Trend] and Slut/t a Mom:—
7712711 ml Top. Initially associated with the New
York dancetpunk scene of the early 20005, the
band later moved physically to Berlin and at
the same time moved musically toward a more
experimental sound,

The title oftheir third album,2006’s Dmm’l
mi! Dead, sums up one or” the main strengths of
the band. Their songs that emphasis drums
and rhythm make the most impact, like on
“Let's Not Wrestle Mt. Heart Attack," where
the drums take charge and propel the song
forward. The toree of rhythm in the songs is
counterbalanced by singer Angus Andrew's
whispery falsetto vocals. Andrew is known
for his energetic stage performances, though
this might be tuned down when the Liars visit
Gardener, as he recently threw out his back and
has performed recent shows sitting in various
cushioned chairs. _

While the Liars may be headlining the
show, No Age, the opening act, may end up as
the highlight of the night, Having only per
formed their ﬁrst show a year and a halr ago.
the band has already gained significant attent
tion from blogs, and was the subject ofa prot
file in The Nt’wyﬂrl’ﬂ in November. The LA,
based band, consisting of diummer/vocalist
Dean spunt and gmirarist Randy Randallpro-
duce a sound larger than most two piece bands
can manage, largely due the loops and feed-
back on Randall’s guitar.

When the band leans more heavily on
these effects, their music could easily be con-
sidered in the experimental genie, bu; when
the vocals and drums kick in, the inﬂuence or
the L.A. punk scene starts to shine through. In
the course ot’a single song, the band can oscil»
late between the sounds ofexperimcntal noise
to a traditional gar-age punk band, or layer the
two styles on top ofonc another.

The band has only released one album so
tar, last year’s Weir-do Rippers, a collection of
songs previously released as vinyl-only EPs,
and are set to make their semi-major label die
but on Sub Pop in MayThey gained their reps
utation throughout last year for their energetic
live shows. and Gardener’s intimate setting
should be an ideal venue to showcase them.

Someone still loves you Someone
Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin!

Even thelate Russian president’s liver might be a fan of this indie pop band

In high school,l wrote a play from the per—
spective orBoris Yeltsm's liver.I can't begin to
imagine the fury that that liver would have for
a band whose name celebrates its cruel master.

But maybe, for the hell of it, that liver
would go to a someone Still Loves You Bo-
ris Yeltsin concert anyway and be surprised to
find that hatrcd melting away.

The songs are warm and powerful 'The lyre
ics are intelligent but not pretentious Caught
up in the joy that only expertly crarted pop
music can provide, that liver might even buy
a Ttshirt.

And perhaps being condemned to a liter
time ofsmarttass comments about your smart-
ass band name isn't so bad. Mostly without the
help ofa label, SSLYBY has iiddcn that name

and an excellent debut album to become it feels
good, democratic Internet triumphrThcy were
even invited to play a festival in Moscow where
they entertained hundreds of bewildered Ru5t
sians.

Mostly though, SSLYBY is perfect int
die pop, In a song, you might recognize bits
of British invasion harmonies or Weezer, but
these inﬂuences have inspired more an appm~
priarion of spirit than sound.They seem like a
band that loves the medium ofpop.

They understand that in roughly three
minutes and 30 seconds, perceived riivoliry
can contain giavity. “Pangaea," they lamcnt on
the opener to their album, “\vliy’d we have to
drift apart?”

Most important, however, their love {or

pop transforms their live show into a joyous
celebration of Rock n’ Roll.You leave thinking
that they seem like awesome people.

incidentally, they are awesome people. A
few summers ago SSLYBY was playing a show
near where I was living but, sadly, the venue
was 21v and I was a mere twenty.

But a friend of mine knew the band and
told them about my situation. The hand then
called the venue and reported that they had
added a sixth member who only played the
tambourine and who, being underage, would
need to be let into CllllJr

They handed me a tambourine and let me
rock onstage with them (or the whole show.
Damn,
