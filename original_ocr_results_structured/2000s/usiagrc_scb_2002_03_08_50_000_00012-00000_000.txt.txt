First hockey game leaves (mostly) happy memories

From the time 1 woke up last Saturday, I could harclycontam my
cxcltemcnt.

Not only was i visiting Los Angeles for the very rust time thanlts
to a college newspaper conference being held there, not only was the
temperature there a very un-Grinnell 76 degrees, not
only did i get eight hours orrontinuous sleep the
night herorc, out I w going to see my very ﬁrst

There's asemipto team located about
an hour rrom my hometown that I‘ve
seen herore, hut, sinee most orthe play.
ers on that team are younger than I am, my ego reruses to believe
they could he pro anything. The L A. game was thus to he my virgin
hockey otperienre.

Like any ﬁrst time, I was both nervous and oteited. Sure, seeing
the game, between the Los Angelee Kings and the Columbus Blue
ladrets, was going to he an amazing, hut was I really rmdy? Would I
be able to at in with the other fans who had ymrs or experience?
would I know what to do when the home team sound? What in

watching?

it was with all these quotions in mind that l approached the
staples Center, home ordie Kings, with opinion editor Sarah Alward

The game was diherent than I expected from the beginning. The
seeurity eheelt at the door was smrlcr than ld thought it would be, as
the guards checked not only for the

usual hanned items (sloohol, drugs,
Blue leeltet paraphernalia), hut also

Clearly they had every intention or

Luckily, things got hotter item there. There were plenty of nice
ushers to ease our rears, helping us ﬁnd outseao by saying things like
“Keep going up" and "Keep going up some more." When we ﬁnally
got to our seats, there were plenty ofniee fans around to malte us feel
at home, like the juvenile detention center on a held trip diet sat a
section away from us.
