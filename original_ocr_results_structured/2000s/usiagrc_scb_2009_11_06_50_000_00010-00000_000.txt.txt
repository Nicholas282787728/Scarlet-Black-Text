Volleyball makes
MWC tournament

EYNAINA CHHIBER

The Grinnell Volleyball team got a an extra special treat
this Halloween. on Saturday, the Pioneers learned that they
made the Midwest Conference Tournament. Following their
defeat of Knox College in their home ﬁnale on Oct. 28, the
Pioneers had to wait to find out winner ofLake Forest Col-
lege vs. Lawrence University and Ripon College vs. Carroll
College. Lawrence or Carroll had to win in order for the
Pioneers to move on.

News ofa Lake Forest victory hit the team first on Sate
urday and the tournament hopes for the Pioneers seemed
false, as Ripon had already clinched a tournament position.

_ But they continued to wait for the news, and eventually, the
Pioneers patience was rewarded.

“An hour later, we were all sitting around the table in
Portillos when we got the phone call that Ripon had lost and
we were going to the tournament,"Mo Gallo-Chasanoff’lo
said. "Everyone screamed, chairs went ﬂying, people were
laughing and crying. It was one of the best moments of my
life."

Due to the nature of the Ripon loss, Grinnell was cata-
pulted from on the bubble of a tournament berth to the third
seed in the tournament. St, Norbert clinched first place
with a conference record of 870. Beloit and Ri on round out
the tournament as the second and fourth see s respectively

In the first round, Grinnell will face Beloit, who they lost
to 1-3 at Beloit on Oct. 14. The Pioneers will lean on their
stats and starters to make it through the tournament.

"Claire Reeder [’11], Olivia Wilks ['12], Carlie Beach
['10], Bonnie Kitcher ['12], Liz Davis [’11],Michelle Briggs
[’13] and Erin Labasan [’11] will take us to that [Beloit]
match and hopefully on to win conference," Caitlin Helter-
line ’10 said in an esmzil.

After ﬁve years of winning [the Midwest Conference

Championship, the Grinnell Women‘s Tennis Team lost 4-5
in the ﬁrst round of the Conference tournament to St. Nor-
bert Coils on Oct 16 in Rockford, Ill. The Pioneers ﬁnished
third and t. Norbert went on to beat Beloit College to claim
the tournament title.
‘ “There ,wtte tears shed and there was disappointment,”
Head Coach Andy Hamilton said. "But we had a very ﬁne sea—
son, we went 15-3 and all is not last. We did mm around in
the individual ﬂight at singles and doubles competition and we
played extremely well."

With the wounds of the St. Norbert loss only an hour old,
the women had to play in the third round match against Lake
Forest College. They defeated the Forresters 5—2.

"For Lake Forest, we were all down from the previous loss
but beaten Lake Forest during the season and we knew that if
we went out with clearer heads that we could deﬁnitely take
home third and win again.” Kelsey Picken '10 said.

Despite losing the team title, Grinnell had two singles
champions and two doubles championships. Constanza Alarv
con '13 and Tatynna Sukharnikova ’12 won in the No, 3 and No.
4 position respectively on Oct. 18. sukharnikova’s victory was
her second singles championship. Last year she won in the No.
5 division.The doubles team ofAlarcon and Catharine Fitch
’13 took ﬁrst at No. 2 doubles and Kelsey Picken ’10 and Jill
Akiyama’lO won at No.3.

“1 was going to get gold ‘cause last year we got silver and
there is nothing more perfect than going and getting gold as a
senior,"Picken said. "Constanza played really well and it was
obviously a great win butTatyan-a’s match was the most ridicu-
lous thing I’ve seen. It was probably the best match f the whole
weekend." ‘

Hamilton was impressed with the maturity his team dis
played after the loss and in the Lake Forest match.

“If our women are able to carry themselves in other parts
of their lives under difficult circumstances like they did in
the Conference tournament, they’re going to do very well for
themselves," Hamilton said.

The Pioneers will continue their 200940 campaign this
spring when they play in tournaments over Spring Break.

“Our two seniors will be focused on ﬁnishing otfgrear ctr
teers,”Hamilton said. "And we have a nice opportunity to rack
a very good record again. I’m sure that each one of our players
can say, ‘Hey,1 need to work on this, this and this,' and that will
be their focus [this spring]."

Both Men’s and Women’s Basketball fill their roster with several first years

BYDARWIN MANNING

Grinnell Women's Basketball is looking to build oﬁ’a 4-19 sea-
son last year with a rewrmped term that includes seven ﬁrst years.

“So fin we have been working towards [improving this year]
with our preseason preparation being a lot stronger this year
than it was last year," Conch Gluckman said.

Although the team has only lost shooting guard Jody VVnt»
kins '09 to graduation, the team almost doubled in size with the
addition of the first years. Since the team is so young, the ﬁrst
years are a vital component to the team and have already been
included as such.

“Our team atmosphere is very welcoming and our ﬁrst years
have already found a home within our program,"Gluckman said.

Though they will also face the challenge ofberng torced to
rely heavily on ﬁrst years.

"This year our team is relying pretty
strongly on the ﬁrst years since they are
about half of the team," Forward jessica
Shorts '10 said. “We are going to need n
lot ofthem to play some minutes."

The freshman class includes four
guards, two centers and a forward, giving
the team far more balance than in previ—
ous years.

"We will have an inside and outside presence this year, and
so one otour strengths will be our vetsatility,"Gluckmnn said.

Thcwomen's Basketball team has also adopted a new style
of offense.

The new style “requires athletes to be very smart on the
court, and should be something that will fit in well with the
strident athletes on our team, but [it is a] slight switch in mm,
tality,“ Gluckman said,

Despite the excitement over the new offense, Coach Gluck-
man still believes that defense will be the key to the team’s success.

“Our biggest challenge by for will be in sustaining a relent-
less and aggressive defense,"Gluckman said.

The Grinnell VVomcn’s Basketball team will begin the seas
son on the road against Cornell College on Nov. 15, followed
soon after by their ﬁrst home matches against Bucna Vista
Univeislry on Nov. 20 and then against Martin Luther Collcge
on Nov. 21.

Men’s Basketball at Grinnell over the last few years has
played to outstanding success including advancing to confer-
ence ﬁnals last year. This year however, the team will be debut-
ing several ncw players in order to continue their tradition of
producing one otthc most potent offenses in NCAA basketball,

“VVe’tl like to win our conference and lead the country in

”The first years are play/n9 like first
year:...But they are a talented group
who wi/l eventua/ly figure things out,”

Men’s Head Coach David Arsenault

scoring and three-point shooting," Head Coach David Arse-
neault said. “The key to this will be developing team chemise
try and amping up our defensive effort so we can better create
scoring opportunities."

That said, team cascaptaln Ross Preston '10 can’t wait until
the season gets underway.

“l’m most excited to continue playing in the ‘system’ and
exciting the crowds, home or away," Preston said. .

The “system" began under Arsenanlt and relies on three
point shooting and turnovers to rack up a high number of points.
The key is trading two points for three. In addition, substitutes
are handled hockey style with multiple players coming on and
offin order to keep the players on the floor as fresh as possible.

The team has lost several key contributors to their success
over the past four years.

"We lost three players, David Ar»
seneault [’09], john Grotberg ['09] and
Bobby Long ['09],who combined to score
7000 career points. We also lost two valu
able role playersiAhmed ldrissn [’09]
and RJ. Roewe [’09],"Arseneiiult said.

In lieu of these graduated players,
Gtinncll’s basketball team has added eight
first years including forward Grifﬁn Lentsch ’13, their top
prospect, and must now develop these new players.

“The first years have been playing like first years. Lots of
ups and downs. But they are a talented group who will eventus
ally ﬁgure things out,"Arsencnult said.

Captain Preston also emphasized his faith in the new plityeis.

“Our new freshmen are an integral part to our success this
year and I think the campus will be getting to know them
soon,” Preston said.

Arsenault plans on stressing the Pioneers' advantage in
games~their athleticism and their overall size. However, per
haps evcn more importantly they will need to overcome their
greatest ﬂaw.

“Our weakness is our propensity for turning the hall ovcr,’
Arsencault said.

The men's team Will need to develop their first years and
solve their turnover problem quickly in order to stay compcth
tive both in and out ofconfeicnce phy.

“The noneconference schedule is the roughcst we have ever
had Past championship teams would have struggled with this
schedule," Arsenelittlt said.

Finally, the wait for the “system" will soon be over, as the resin
opens it home versus Waldorf College, a team who defeated
