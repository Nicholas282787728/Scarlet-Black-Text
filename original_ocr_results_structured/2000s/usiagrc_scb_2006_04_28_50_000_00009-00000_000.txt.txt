Letters to the Editor

The Salad responds to editorial

Since April 12, 2006 you have been In possession of our letter to
the editors of the sen? regarding our criticism and republication of
the Danish cartoon. Although you confirmed both over email and
verbally that you would print our letter last week,

you chose Instead to suppress our letter and sup- In your ed/larra/ you appropriated
many aft/re arguments (untamed

plant it with your staff editorial entitled‘ Keep the
Danish out of TI]: Sula. " .

In your editorial you appropriated many of the In aur/ener
arguments contained in our letter and passed them
oer as your own. Additionally, you made fIlse claims regarding our
initial criticism ofthe ideologies contained in the Danish cartoon we
reprinted.

We will not ask why, when you had our letter since Monday
April 12, Ind told us you would print it, you instead stayed up late
on Thursday night to write a disingenuous staﬁcditorial.We do not
ask whether you also chose to print your staff editorial mther than

letteIs by other students who may have written to the stair about the

cartoon.

We simply demand that you print this letter, along wuh our at—
tached etplanation, which can be found taped to
the back ofall issues of 772: Salad that remained in
the post ofﬁce on April 14. We hope community
members will read our belatedly printed letter, as
well as the second issue ofThe salad and judge
the SGB’s claims to superior “civic responsibility"

for themselves.

Additionally, we suggest that a responsible campus publication .
would promote and cover the events that T,” Salad editors-in-chief
and the Muslim Student Association cabinet members worked to-

gether to organize.

not because they are idolattous, but because they may
