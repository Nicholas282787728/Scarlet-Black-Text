It’s big, it’s coming, it’s The Dick

BYJi‘il GARG

Every year, hundreds ofarhletes make rhe journey to Grinncll
College to compete in pantheon orall Grinnell mick events. 0t
course,Thc Dick young Classic, or just “The Dick” for shon, is rhe
only Grinnell track event of the season. Nonetheless, the amount
ofefrort and manpower that is put into making this event happen
is worthy of the Greek gods.

on April 19,Thc Dick which starts at 9 am. and goes unr
til 5 pm ,will have competition from is different teams in every
imaginable crack and field event, from [be running and relays to
the always—entertaining javclln throw,

The teams that come to The Dick come from all over the
heartland as well as places as far as Colorado. Most of the teams
that are in the event are non-conference teams but constantly par-
ticipate year in and year out. “A lot of teams come and compete at
the cvent,"s‘.iid track and ﬁeld athlete Fernando “Fonz"Jenkins'lO.
“Everybody gets to compete and show off their abilities."

To make sure that the events go on without a hitch,a lot ofstu-
dent volunteer ofﬁcials are needed to conduct the events. “It takes
about a 100 ofﬁcials to run a track meet,” said Women's Track and
Field Coach Evelyn Freeman. “Grinnell College students do not
have the time to ofﬁcial the entire event, so I double the amount
ofoFﬁeials."

Officials do get some perks from volunteering, rhey get a re
shirt rhat rhey can keep as well as the always-appreciated food and
drinks. “This is how 1 bribe them," said Freeman. “Every yedr,l
have a diﬂ'crent color ofﬁcnil Trshirt.”

Many of the volunteers are friends and teammates wirh people
on the track team and daus have additional motivation to be at the
event. To make sure that people even more ofa reason to volunteer
Freeman tries her best to make sure people are ofﬁciating cvenrs
in which their friends or reaminates might be participating. “1H
have football players working, then i try to have them olticiate the
throwing events because they are teammates with the rhrowers."
said Freeman, “It gives them an extra incentive."

The Dick is large enough that almost all ofrhe funding is builr
into the track team's budget.That includes the t—shlrts, the Porra~
Johns and the awards that are given out for each of the events

Apart from the budget, the scope ofThe Dick goes much air-
rher than just the oﬂieials who volunteer in four-hour shifts.There
is student security that is needed ro work ir, the manor of accomr
modnring all ofrhe reams that show up, and someone to announce
all of the different events.

To carry out the announcements ro all otthe athletes, volnnr
teers, and spectators former President and Professor Emeritus of
History George Drake 'so graciously voiunreers his time. A former
runner himself, Drake has been announcing the events for many

ars.

Even with all of these tlungs happening behind thc scene.
come April 19 the focus will be on the athletes. Both the men
and women's mick coaches put a lor of focus on preparing for this
event. “All or are schools are pretty competitive," said Jenkins.
“Other than conference, this is the meet the coaches concentrate
on the most,”

Athletes go beyond the game

ll\' CLAIRE REEDER

Grinnell athletics are prominent on campus, be it in the preva—
lence of Honor G logos emblazoned on tvarmrup jackets, the
posters constantly advertising weekend home matches hung out-
side the dining hall, or the famed basketball “System” that ESPN
promises to broadcast (though sometimes to no availl). Despite
the high proﬁle of athletics at Grinnell, the activities and role of
rho student Athletic Advisory Committee, the group which rep-
resenB athletes, is relatively unknown.

Student Athletic Advisory Committee (SAAC), a group manr
dated by the NCAA, advocates for athletes and acts as a liaison
between student-athletes and the college. SAAC caters to athletes
and makes sure their needs are met. For mmple, SAAC tried to
extend dining hall hours on Friday evenings to ensure athletes
could car dinner afrer practice.

With two representatives from each sport sewing on the corn~
mince, all teams are equally represented and ottercd an arena to
voice concerns,while also building connections with other athletes.
Other campus issues involving arhlcrcs have included requests to
build an ice rink, managing scheduling and space in the PEC and
the eventual dociSion to tear down the energyrinefﬁcient PEC
once Darby Phase 11 is completed in approximately rhe fall of
2011.

A big project for SAAC this spring is rhe organization of a
sports camp for local kids on May 10rThe camp will help towards
fulfilling communiry service goals of Grinneil athletics The idea
for a sports camp stems from the Midwest Conference SAAC
convenrions held each fall and spring and attended by one female

and one male representative from each school.

“We're trying to start a new t-tudinon where each school in the
conference holds a sports camp and collect old sports equipment
to donate to people in need,"said Vice President Cardin I—lelrerline
’1 ‘Eventually we’d like to take our donations and help internar
tionally.”

SAAC also does volunteer work outside or just spons and
sporting equipment. “We've also sponsored FacultyrStaﬂ” Night
out as a chance for the faculty and staffro go out while we babyr
sit their kids,"said SAAC President Alex PCllZ '10. Student-ath-
letes play games and watch movies with children tor several hours
at no cost to their parents.

Other current SAAC projects include holding cookours ar
baseball and softball games this spring on April 19 and May 3.
GOAL awards banquet at the end ofthe year culmmates SAAC's
activrties each spring and recognizes the accomplishments of sur-
dentrathlctes.

Next up, SAAC is sponsoring a nutritionist speaking on nulﬂ’
tion and athletics. She will highlight the benefits and disadvan-
tdgcs ofencrgy drinks and bars, when and whar ro eat before, dur-
ing and after competitions, vegetarianism and athletes and offer
general nutrition advice.

“The nutritionist should be of particular interest to NCAA
athletes, bur also intramural sporr playeis and the general student
body are welcome," said Helterline.

The nurririonisr Will be speaking Thursday, April 24 at 7:30
pm. in Jim loll—he talk will be open to all of campus.

It’s knuckle-
puck time!

I’ve got to bc honcst,l am a huge fan of terrible, terrible sports
movies. Sure,l like the classics like Bul/Dllr/yam, Caddy/snark and
Slap seer, bur that’s not where my real passion lies. My favorite
sporrs movies are in the vein orLin/e Big Leagnc,/l//ey Call Sarita
and Tilt RIp/amllmlriunabashedly horrible movies that i find
myseifwarching over and over again. i love rhese type of move
ies so much 1 would go as far as saying that wirh Isaiah Thomas
on his way out as the coach of the Knicks (and well he should
be) there is clearly only one person that can truly turn that team
around: Whoopi Goldberg. Sure instead ofonc stncy Patton on
the team, there are at least half a dozen, but ifshc can't motivate
them, no one can.

Naturally, as you might imaginc, these types of mones are
prone ro misrakes such as plor holes and problems wirh rhe rech-
nical aspects of the sports they are portraying, but the average
moviegoer easily overlooks most of these. And normallyl can
put rhese mistakes out of my mind. But 1 have an unfortunate
tendency to oveninalyze sports movies, and there are some plot
points I just can't manage to gcr past. Here are some examples.

Now, I've
seen D2 The
Mrglly Diner
over 50 times,
and by so I’m
nor being like
Will Chamr
bcrlain estir
mating he had sex with 20,000 different women.l have actually
sat down and watched the movie from beginning to end at least
50 times. Having seen the movie so many times. the main thing
that irks me is how nobody is a defenseman. Really I would say
that Fulton and Foirinaii arc dctcnscman, and probably Russ, but
Russ is a terrible puck handler wnh no speed or agiliry and is only
good for one thing, Making him, at best a sixth defenseman, and
maybe even a situational sevenrh,

I've come to the conclusion that the problem really lies with
the fact that the USA Ducks are about 6‘7 players short ofa
ﬁlll ream.Thcy only have 14 players (including the two goalies),
which makes for only two lines of forward itnd six D, or three
lines- and three D, or something like three lines of wings with
two centers rotating through and four D, none ofwhich would
he even remotely feasible on even a local level, much less an inv
ternational one.

It becomes even morc ridiculous when you rcaliu rhnr when
Banks comes back rrom his wrisr injury they have to make Char-
lie a healthy scratch. Which means that, by the rules of the Junior
Goodwill Gaines, they can only dress 13 players total (for a frame
ofrefercnce, NHL teams dress 20). Are rhey trying ro kill these
kids)

Another moviel have
a problem with is [loo/tie
off/MYMI. And no, my
problem is not that it has
rhe Cubs winning the
World Series, aldiough it
is even more absurd when
you realize their two best
pitchers are hurr. No, rhe
part of the movie I can’t
get over is how a kid with
only a hundred mile per hour fastball can be so dominant No
matter how fast you rhrow, pro hitters are going to be able ro hit
it

Jordan Kujala'09
Minnesgta Miracle Man

W/‘th lSOlali Thomas on no
way out (and well lit‘ should
be) [here l5 clear/y only one
person that (an truly tum
Illa! team around: WllOOpl
Goldberg

In addition, the net that Henry is tiny is not going to help
him out; it’s of extreme beneﬁt for a pitcher to be taller in or-
dcr to get leverage on rhe bnli. There is a reason why after the
1968 season they lowered the mound from “15 inchesllto ten, as it
was giving pitchers too much ofan advantage Maybe his Nuke
Lalooshriike control early on was enough to get batters slightly
uncomfortable in the box, but eventually he was going to have to
learn another pitch. And, in all seriousness, if he hadn't ended his
career by slipping on a baseball, he most certainly would have had
to undergo TommyJohn surgery with those tcrriblc mechanics.

Fortunately, the problems I have mentioned pale in compari-
son to the Bob Costas in BASE/eerie” level of joy and ereircmcnt
these films bring. It doesn't matter that it’s completely unbeiicvr
ablc that Luis Mendoza is the fastest skater on the team but can't
stop, or that a team full ofptofessioniil baseball players is going to
listen to some eleven year-old kid, because ir gives you a chance
to discuss those errors and bring in your own sports knowledge
while simultaneously enjoying an entertaining movie, making for
an allraround fantasric spans etperience.
