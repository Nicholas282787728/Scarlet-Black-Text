Bowling for (a) dollar

BVNIKKlJAMESON

Saturday afternoons are typically quiet on campus. Most
of the time, you either find diligent Grinnellians getting ahead
on their work or overworked Grinnellians catching up on some
sleepTo find some atmosphere, you have to get offcar-npus and
go bowling.

For the past two years, a group of three Grinnellians have
run the Grinnell bowling club, which allows students to ﬂock
to Grinnells local bowling alley at Fifth and state to spend
their attemooo knocking down pins and forgetting about work.
The bowling is free Students just have to put up a dollar for
shoe rental

“It started as my friends and l trying to get free bowling
from SGA," said Mike Fenster ’08. “When we started putting
up signs, it really exploded." ,

Brandon Retcher'OE, the second ofthe club’s three founding
members,was the driving force behind the club’s expansion

“When I started the second semester my trcshinan year,"
Retcher said, “we had maybe eight to nine people coming.
When Mike [Fenster] studied abroad, I really tried to promote
the club by advertising and telling people to invite their friends.
Now we get on average 30 people aweelt."

Even on Saturday, a slow week by this year's standards, seven
of the lanes were occupied, filling the alley with the sounds of
crashing pins, balls rolling down the alley and expletives from
those facrng a split. The week before, all 10 lanes filled with
other bowlers still waiting.

But the club's humble beginnings are well suited to the
humble alley.

The aura of the alley can undoubtedy be called a draw to
the club as well. .strikes and spares bring incredibly cheesy ani-
mations to the scoreboard. The decor of the alley itselflooks
like it hasn't changed in at least 20 ycars,The walls are a dingy
brown color and the carpet is well worn The shoes seem even
uglier than at other alleys, ifthat's possible. Combined with the
occasional equipment breakdowns, all ofthis tells you that yes,
you’ve reached a small—town bowling alley.

“At this time of day it s either homework or bowling," srud
Lindsey Helmiich 10.

“Its a great way for people to just rclav,"said leffSinick '09,
the third co-lcadcr, “There is no pressure. People just come in
bowl and have ,1 good time with thcir friends,"

The club welcomes all bowlers, cxperienccd or not, Coﬂl’
petitivc or not, anti it takes almost no time to figure out who
had been around longer and who was really just thcrc for fun.

“We do offer advicc"Sinick said.

Most of Sinick’s advice dealt with the most fundamental
bowling strategies. He advises that bowlers eventually learn
how to curve the ball, giving them a better chance to hit the
pocket (the area between the first and the second pin).

After all his technical advice, be promptly left himself a
split.

BYMARKJAPINGA ANDJM Cant:

just as Oceania has always been at war with Eastrsia, it
seems Grinncll college has always been under construction
Even with Noycc complete, studcnts will only have a bricf
reprieve before cranes and bulldozers return to campus. Con~
struction is scheduled to begin in the spring of2008 on the next
project, Phase 11 otthe new Athletics and Fitness center, and
should be completed no later than the summer of 2011.

This Tuesday, architects Brad McCord and Darin Cools,
the same architects who oversaw Phase I of the athletic expan-
sion and the joe Rosenneld ’25 centenjoined Athletic Director
Greg Wallace to formally present the plans for Grinnell's latcst
athletic additions.

The two major additions, a 74,000 square—foot pool and a
125,000 square-foot fieldhouse, will be the latest in a series of
athletie expansions designed to give Grinnell some of the best
facilities in Division HI.

With building plans set and coaches eagcr to see the begins
ning of construction, Vice President for Institutional Planning
Marci Sortor said that one obstacle stands in the way.

“All ofthis is contingent on the trustees approving it during
their October meeting." The total cost otthe building, Current-
ly unavailable,will notbc approved until then,rncaning that the
current plan may be tweaked again.

“If thcy approve, [the trustees] will probably say you can
only spend a certain amount,” sortor said, which could poten—
tially deal a blow to a portion ofthe project.

Assuming trustee approval, though, here’ a brief overview
ofwhat students can find in thc new complex.

Pool

The new pool is “tiled for construction iust west ofthe curs
rent football parking lot, taking up some ofspnngcr Field, and
probably impacting the intramural clubs who rise springer lot
practice

The building itself will mimic the architecture of Darby,
adding to the campus’ recent boom of modern, \VllldOWTl‘illCd
and bland brown buildings. Inside, the Olympicssized pool
will attract most ofthe attention,but the new building will also
contain a new rock climbing wall and a dance studio.

Erin Hurley, the men’s and women's swimming coach, was
excited that the new facility will solve the I’EC’s greatest \vcaka

ness: overcrowding.

“Right now, [practices] go from 2:30 to 6:30 during the sea-
son, because thcrcs no time for an alternative," said Hurley. As
Grinnells only swimmin pool, the PEC must currently servicc
both of Grinnells swim teams, Grinnells high school teams,
local swim clubs, community lap swim and other community
events, creating many instanccs where the pool is either quire
crowded or closed to the general public,

The new pool should diminish these problems, “We're able
to section off the pool with bulkheads so that the community
can swim at the same time as the swim team,” Hurley said.
This guarantees that students and Community members will
no longer have to deal with the inconsistent hours that have
plagued the PEC since it opened in 1974.

While the pool seems isolated from the rest of the new athr
letic facilities, an underground walkway will connect the pool to
Darby and contain a new locker room.

l—lurley hopes that the new facility will raise Grinnell's pro»
file to prospective swimmers, drawing students out to Iowa and
away from other D111 powers,

Fieldhouse

Noith of Darby, the new fieldhouse represents the other
halt of the Phase ll project. A zoo-meter running track will
encompass four tennis courts, and the building will also include
new facilities for field events The building will resemble the
room in the PEC that contains the same r ties, bill will be
larger, more open and able to support multiple events happei‘r
ing at the same time

Tennis coach Andy llamilton, like Hurley, is also look-
ing forward to practices [2 no rl ice concurrently in the same
building. “Inside, you can have a unpus event Outside you
can have community use ofthe tra ," Hamilton said.

Outside, an open loggia will face the football field and cr-
tend down its entiic eastern side, allownig fans a view of a home
game, inside the fieldhousc antlthc possibility ofa party deck.
Just south of the ficldhousc, racquetball courts will be placed
next to the new athletic ofﬁces.

What happens to the PEC’ As soon as the new tacilites are
finished, the PRC will be demolished to make room for a pos-
sible parking lot, more green space or even a new dorm. Thats
right: more construction
