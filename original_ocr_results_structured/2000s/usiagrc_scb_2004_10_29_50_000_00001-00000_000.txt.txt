notice the car driving up behind themThe student
heard a click that sounded like a gun and then was
hit with what seemed like a small pellet or rock, said
Steve Briscoe, director otseeurity.

The student’s coat defected most ofthe harm of
the object, according to Briscoe.

The vehicle is believed to have been a red Escort,
and it may have also been involved in another incr
dent last night, also on Eighth.

In this incident. motorists swerved towards a col-
legc staff member walking on the sidenralia'rbe car
drove by, went around the block, and then came back
to yell at the staffer.

surroundings. We’ve had a number of harassment
incidents, assault incidents in that area,"he said.
