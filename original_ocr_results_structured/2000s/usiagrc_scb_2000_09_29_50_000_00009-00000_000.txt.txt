A brief treatise on flirting

Alliso . here are those times: you spot that t-rber
cutie across the room at a party, not into that tab Friend
standing in the Quad line waiting rot CPI", etc. ..
your tummy goes squidgey (which could. in tact. bc
the CPP itself), you make eye contact and ﬂash the
smile, and then you're lost, Now comes the hard part
a how to get and keep ihis Wlindcrkind's attention
That's where ﬂirting coincs in, we realize that the
prospect of ﬂirting can be absolutely mindr
numbingly terrifying _ especially to

vice Patrick and i will bestow our
grand wisdom onto you,

I’m not a tlirr. well, I guess
everyone is a rim to a cer—

just be thought ores i

honest, 1 don’t even
really understand ﬂirt.

understand. that was made clear at the training ses.
sion, but the general idea behind it and how to do it,
well i missed the bus on that one, But asAlli informs
me, 1 apparently am one orthc oftvmisconstrlicd types,
so, to clarity. this is an article (or those out there who
are actively seeking to ﬂirt.

A: There are a couple routes to take. The ori i-
nal intention or this article was going to be to dis.
suadc people from resorting to obscene levels otsub.

1‘, Saying “Hey Baby, how YOU dolng?" and
strolling np casually is not a good idea, t. this sets
you apart from everyone else as an avid tan or
“Friends." A great show. yust not realistic.

A: Actually, with the proper tongue in cheek and
delivered perrectlyi liloeyTribitni, that phrase could
be construed as cndcanng, You‘d be surprised at the
number ofclosetcd “Friends" fans out there. Dcliw
ered seriously. howcvcrr look out for the smaekdown

P: All right, I admit it , . . 1 like “Friends " But
let’s move on. some Dos: well there's the obviousbe
polite and friendly, blah blah blah. one would hope,
however, that we don't have to tell you that and can
move on to someorthc ﬁnu’ points ortlirration. First

things First: rake stock or your ﬂirting ability. Nov.
iccs should start small. Try out
some or your techniques on
your roommate. If he or she
has no clue what's going on,
you'rc being too subtle. 1r
he/she ﬁgures it out.

to intermediate level.

A: Okey dokey onto the intermediate level: this
is the big time, kidsrspending time together. i know
’gasp slinck,‘ but iryou’re up to this level, then we
think you're ready rot it. There are the sneaky ap
proaches to this: maybe you accidentally run into each
otherat the Forum or ,ust happen to Oops! switch
your keys. wait. no, rharsstalking (well
talk about that later) But seriously, ask the cutie it
they want to go for a walk or do homework together
orsomcthing chill and noneommittal like that. That
way the pressure ortlie situation is reduced and even

bravo! You no longer need our sorry help.

P: Expert levclt Ifyou really are an “export," why
are you even reading this> (You should be out there
right now, killer!)

A: Now onto the Gooeroeron’ts: 1) Don't
hover. Everyone needs theirspacc, and sad to say, but
that might mean that they don't want to be sharing
space with you 2) Donrsttlk it makes you lookdesr
perate, nutty, and downright psycho Limit your calls
andvisirs to reasonable, non insane times (even ifyour
erush is an insomniac Although we do hear those in.
somniaes are way cute . . .). it's best for everyone ira
restraining order need not be ﬁled. oieourse, these
suggestions apply only to those situations where they
seem to be'inappropriate and possibly unwelcome. If
she person is happy to see you and sits up and blithely
chitchats with you despite the crazy late hour then it’s
probably No K.

P: if, however, the person screams “stalked" and
promptly slams the door, you might want to reevalu.
atc your relationship.

To summarize: Don't be so subtle that your abjet
dkﬁdwn remains utterly clueless, and so unsubtle as
to drive him/herawoyscrcaminginab)ect horror. Re.
member the key is to hopefully get them to like you,
not to drive them to swear orr romance forever, Re.
ally though, just be mature, sensitive, and considerate
orrhc other person and you should do ﬁne. Really.

DULUTH, MINN.: A small group oi Min.
nesotans oiseandinavian desoent has organized to
protest the long.running cartoon “Hagar the Hot-
rible," on the grounds that it is racist and promotes
an inaccurate and negative view orNorse culture.
The working namc orihc organization is “Hagar
IS Horrible." The current president or the group,
Lcir Hendrickson, told reporters, As scandina.
vitns wears proud orourheritage, but being Norse
is more than raiding and plundering We are not
all named Helgaor Hagar or Hamlet and many or
our ancestors wcrc hcrdsmcn, or producers oreloth
and handictarts." The group stated in a press re.
lease that they wish that the Vikings could be re
membered for their cxtcnsivc exploration of the
northern Atlantic, which occurred well heroic the
days orColumbus. Recent archaeological cxcnva»
tions in ctsenland have turned up early Norse farm-

ing settlements, and the group wishes to point out
that many more Scandinavian men and wom:n fit
this model than the model that has been ottered by
Dik and Chris Brown: since 1975. The group also
mentions that those helmets with the horns on them
were mainly ceremonial, were not worn everyday,
and were never worn by women, and says that this
is just one example oinumerous cultural in.
