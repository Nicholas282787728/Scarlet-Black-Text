Track championships underway

av NATE LINDSEY

The indoor track season, which has given a chance for star
runners and new participants alike to prepare for the upcoming
outdoor season, ends this weekend with the MWC Champiom
ships in Galesburg, IL. Wellrknown runners like David Monte
gomcry'lo and Sarah Spencei ’08 have headlined the Pioneers'
three meets, but a new partnership with the football team has .
brought Coach Will Freeman some new athletes.

The first meet of the season was at Cornell college in rhc
beginning of February, the second at Bucn‘ii Vista's Dennis
Young Classic in Storm Lake, IA., and the third last weekend
at the University of Iowa Open in Iowa City.

Pioneer runners took first in both the men's and women’s
zooormeter (two mile) run at the University otlowa. spenccr
turned in a time of 10:28.67, the best individual 3k time in
the MWC this season. Montgomery overtook the leader ofthc
men’s race in the last lap to finish first with a time of 8:48.15.

In the pole vault, Cassie Sims '08 took third in the Dennis
Young Classic with a heighr of $00.50” despite never vaulting
in high school.

“I get to throw thyself nine feet into rhe air- over and over
during practice," srms said,“It's pretty awesome and also really
challenging.”

While Sims is a veteran at track meets, new participant
Nick Merklin '08 is using the indoor season to find his paiticu-
lar niche before heading to the outdoor season.

“Indoor track gives the freedom to try out different athletes

in different spots to get a feel for who can do what," he said.

Merklin, a defensive back on the football team who earned
Honorable Mention All—MWC honors this past season, joined
as part of a combined effort between the track and football
teams to strengthen both programs and improve the teams‘
athletes,

"A deal was made between Coach Fletchct and Coach Will
Freeman in which the track coaches would help out the football
players with their running form...and Coach Fletcher would
help out the track athletes in the weight room," Merklin said.
“This started my interest and it just took offfrom there."

Mcrklin has found success on the track as a sprinter. In his
first meet at the Buena Vista Open, Mcrklin lcd Grinnell’s
times in both the 55 meter dash and 400 meter (lash

A number or young football players are getting their feet
wet in track with competitive showings in their first collegiate
meets. Andrew LaRue ’10, Mike Hagardine '10. Fonz Jenkins
’10 and Tim McDonald '10 are among those who have pats
ticipated in meets so far, with others focusing more on training
leading up to the outdoor season. That season begins when the
Pioneers travel to Orlando over spring break for the Disney
World Invitational.

It’s awesome, baby! One fan’s salute to Dick Vitale-

I like my sports announcing loud, passionate and enthusias-
tic—-except for john Madden. Few things excite me more than
a soccer announcer yelling wildly after an exciting goal, Bill
Walton emphatically begging NBA star: to “throw it down,"
or former Chicago Cub Ron sanro cycling between legitimate
color commentary, incoherent babble and cheering for rhe
Cubs. One might question their sanity,
but there’s no questioning their passion
for rhc games they love.

Nowhere is this enthusiasm more
necessary than in college basketball,
where student sections, pep bands and
players who care about more than a
paycheck combine to create an atmosphere that cries out for an
energetic announcer to communicate all the excitement.

ESPN announcer Dick Vitale is that man, although he is
the most polarizing figure in sports announcing, His shouting
has annoyed countless fans and caused widespread headaches,
One biogger described Vitale during a particularly enthusiastic

gious rapture every fiber in his body twitching, forehead veins
pulsing, as he strained, like a pit bull on a leash, ro eirplodc."
While everyone else sits in a “Dickie V” induced rage, I
crank up the volume. Vitalc embodies college basketball and
has probably done more for the national profile ofthe game
than any other ﬁgure, not because he’s
the most knowledgeable commentator
or most accurate assessor of talent, but
because of how much he enjoys every
game he announces.
‘ Spoils are first and foremost about
fun and entertainment, and everyone
should agree that Vitale's excitemcnt adds to the overall enter-
tainment value ofan ESPN game. My favorite college basket
ball game of all time, a double overtime clash between Duke
and North Carolina from 1995, sits at the top of my list not
only because the game was fantastic, but also because ofDickie
V's unbridled exuberance, highlighted by his demand that rlrc

game go to “three, four, even five overtimesl"This was topped
off by 20 seconds of nonstop shouting after Jeff Caple hit a
40-footer to send the game into double overtime. I’m getting
excited jusr drinking about in

I've heard all the arguments from the Dickie V haters: he
has a Duke bias, wants to marry H. Redick, loves the ACC,
hates any school not located in one ofthe original 13 colonies
and thinks he can substitute catchphrases for actual analysis.
All of those are true to an cxtent, but one can find biases in
most color commentators I can acknowledge argnrnreuts about
Vitale's decibel level, but no one can survive 27 years at ESPN
by being iitcompetentialthough Joe Morgan is getting close.

My only hope for the next 27 years ofDickie V commons
tary is that he avoids becoming too much of a parody of himself.
While some would argue rhat happened 10 years ago, he still
seems coherent to me. Most irnporrantly, he still has as much
fun announcing as anyone around, and his infectious cnthlisir
asm resonates every time he shouts, “it’s awesome, baby!"
