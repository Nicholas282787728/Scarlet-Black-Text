Emily Reiersgaard ’08
spent her spring break in
the Oregon woods, trekking
through mud, freezing in
rain and sleeping in a tent, all
without showering once,’l‘his
spring break,she is going back
to do it again,

“What made it so me
credible," she said, “was the
fact that we were a gioup
of strangers who collective-
ly thrust ourselves into a star
ation so far removed from
comfort, familiarity and cw
eiyrhing academic.”

Despite experiences like
Rciersgaird's, Alrcmarive
Break may have trouble set
curing adequate funding, pres
hibiting some students from
participating in the future.
Uncertainty over the pro-
grams own fundraising and
the funds it receives from the
Community Service Center
(CSC) has left many wonder~
ingwhcte to go for permanent
funding. Currently. the CSC
proVides the majority of Alt
Break’s budget, which is then
supplemented by participant
fundraising and SGA.

Bur SGA ﬁlnding for Alt
Break is a contentious issue.
Nick Blencowe '08, Adminisz
trative Coordinator for SGA,
voiced concern “It does not
make sense for Alt Break to
receive funding from two
sources," he said. “Because
of Grinnell’s commitment to
social engagement, the CSC
should fully support this pro-
gram, rather than using the
student actiVity fee to fund
community service.”

This year alone, SGA has
given nearly 53,000 to Alt
Break, in part because there
were not other readily Avall’

able sources of money. “Alt
Breaks funding wrll not Slip
below $21,000, bur could
not continue to exist without
SGA's help,"wrlla Campbell,
an Alt. Break coordinator,
said.

This problem is nor new.
In the s " g of 2004, avail-
able funding fell short and
participants wrote letters to
their families and friends
asking for additional money
The effort was a success and
Alt Break received nearly
$15,000,

Because of conﬂicts with
Alumni Relations in the
spring of2006, Alt Break was
told to stop the lettcrrwriting
campaign, Alt. Break wrote a
student initiative to increase
funding for the CBC and in
the next semester received an
additional 53,000 in their ant
nual budget. Though able to
address every request for fr-
nancial aid, the program still
charged a 3200 participation
fee this spiing, the highest
ever

This spring, rhe program
received $51,800 in ﬁnancial
aid, all of which came from
SGA. Campbell said that
Alt Break has been able to
meet the demand for finan-
eial aid “purely wirh the help
of SGA," and because this
spring is the highest amount
of aid ever given. “[This is a
sign] students do not need to
consider the participation fee
[when] applying for trips."
she said.

Last spring, the cooidina-
tors of Alternative Break met
with Steve Langerud.rtliei\
Director of Internships and
Employmentcounselingand
Amy craves, rhcn director of

the CSC. to address the fu—

rure funding of the program
Together with the CD0 and
CSC, the coordinators wrote
a plan rhar would increase
rhcir budget to $100,000 by
2010 This would mean that
Ah Break would not have use
money from SGA or fund
raising to meet the demands
of students.

“Steve’s gift was as a vi-
sionary," Graves said in an
czmail.

But when Langerud left
the college and Graves took
over his job, Alt Break, like
many other community ser-
vicc organizations, no lonr
ger had an administrator to
guide its budget. Currently,
RLC Jennifer Bieniek works
10 hours a week in the CSC,
down from the formerly full-
time administrator position
Graves occupied.

“What feels like uncer
tainty over support for com—
munity service at Grinnell is
definitely a reflection of the
reorganization of the Ofﬁce
of Service, Employment and
career Development,"Graves
snid,“We are short staff"

While Campbell is corr-
ﬁdent about the continued
existence of Alt Break and
funding from somewhere, the
ambitious plan to increase
rheir budget has been put on
hold because ofthe uncertains
ty m the CSC and the lack of
a full—time administrator.

“Although I am not aware
that commitments were made
to ensure our plan through
2010, no one said "no”cithcr,"
Graves said. “one simply cont
tinucs to submit budgets each
year that reflect ones hopes
for their programs."

 

Storm tytoiden
from p. I tify those
people with health issues,"
said Ness, noring that these
efforts will help should the
next storm hit.

The Mayﬂower retire-
ment community in town,
which includes private and
assistcdzlivmg housing units,

is home to many with health
issues. According to Execur
tive Director Bob Mann, the
Mayflower campus, which has
both apartments and assisted
living facilities, lost power for
about twelve hours. While
its health center immediately
switched to a generator, many
of the private apartments lost

electricity and by extension
heat,

But a second generator
kept the administration room
heated during the last storm,
and Mann encouraged those
from the community to come
to the building if they need a
place to stay.

As many prepare for an—

other storm to sweep across
the state, all members of the
community have various op-
tions for safe shelter. But
even as they get ready, some
hope these plans will all be
for nothing. “We’re all just
praying for nice weathei and
spring." said Williams.

 

SPARC

Last year, SPARC approved similar funding

Petric '07 and Justin Riley ’06 say they sold rhe book tor less

f’o’" p' 2 for two KDIC employees to attend the fesri-
val, picking up the check for airfare and a hotel room while the
students made connections with music promoters and bands.

SPARC also slashed the budget of The Cyt/Dm’. The year
book was “the one publication that goes way off budget,” said
SPARC Business Manager Eric Omwega ’07. For the last frvc
years, The Cyrlaiit has been locked into a contract a past editoi
signed with an expensive publishing house. “Thar contract, it
was sort ofthe opcn wound ofSPARC,"says Omwega.“lt was
so expensive." The contract expires this year and Cytlme edis
tor Evan Pctrie '07 has already found another publisher whose
costs are 30 percent less.

The Cyr/on: also ran over budget because the editor has been
paid to work on the yearbook over the summer for the pasr
several years including a stipend for food and rent. “This yearr
we’re not paying anyone during the summer because it costs too
much," Omwega said.

Miscommunication issues are also to blame forbudget prob
lems with The cyr/ona, SPARC rhoughr rhe majority ofrevenne
money from last year's yearbook disappeared. but editors Evan

than SPARC thought. “These are the kinks that SPARC is
working on smoothing out," says omwega.

This semester, the commirrcc is changing payroll procer
dures to create more checksups on publications. While stu-
dents working on publications were previously paid in lump
sums throughout the semester, now SPARC will only release
payment after their publications have been released

“SPARC has always seemed like the biggest mess in terms
of budgeting and accountability," said SPARC’s Assistant
Business Manager Megan Goeringos, who also writes for the
S83. “We'd all heard rumors of corruption, of SPARC funds
going to fund personal rrips." Goering and several other cur-
rent SPARC members ran on reform platforms for election to
the committee last year. Now, Goering and others are discuss
rng whether SPARC should be an elected body at all, instead
proposmg the idea that interested students submit applications
and the business manager (who sits on the committee for rwo
years) chooses who makes up SPARC.Tliis could increase the
number ofstudents competing for spots but, some fear. create a
less responsive committee.

Segue connects
Jesus and poor

av CAITLIN CARMoDv

For Michele Goad ‘07, social justice is fundamental to her
Christian faith.

“Jesus was homeless for most ofhis ministry," she said. “He
identified with the poor, he came to preach to the poor and
brought good news to them, he brought hope,"

Goad and other members of Grinnell College Christian
Fellowship (GCCF) were inspired by the emphasis on poverty
and economic injustice they saw in the Bible, and decided to
make poverty and economic injustice the theme of this year’s
Segre. Throughout aweek otevenrs,many GCCF participants
tried to establish religion, and Christianity in particular, as a
means for addressing poverty,

This is the second year GCCF has put on Segue (last year’s
theme was racial rcconcil'tation).This year’s program consisted
ofa weekrlong series otcvenrs, including a hunger strike in the
Spencer Grill and a discussion and keynote address given by
Ron Sider, professor ofTheology, Holistic Ministry, and Public
Policy at PalmerTheologicltl Seminar in Philadelphia.

According to members of GCCF, the purpose of Segue is
both to engage the campus on asocial issue and to explore how
Christianity can aid in addressing that issue. “As a Christian,
I believe Christians should care about social justice and eco-
nomic injustice," said Kirsten Aho ’08, a Segue organizer. “We
sort of want to demonstrate how [poverty and Christianity are]
connected and in what ways, and [ask], ‘What does that mean
in the future for people?”

Goad said Segue was relevant to everyone, regardless oftheir
religious atfiliation, and marry events did not place any empha-
sis on Christianity. The coffeehouse discussion on Tuesday fo-
cused on what part Christianity plays in poverty, and what Jesus
had to say about helping others. But at the fundrarsing dinner
in Quad on Monday night, attendees are porridge usually given
to people suffering from starvation and the emphasis was not
on religion, but the reality of poverty.

“Segue is very much about meeting people where they're
at,"coad said. “lfyou dour want ro talk about Jesus. poverty is
still an issue."

An inreracrrvc exhibit in JRC 101 included several displays
such asposrers with provocative povertyztclatcd questionswhich
included room for participants to add their own thoughts.The
result was posters containing conversations about many topics.
including whether or not charity is a condescending endeavor,
who rs to blame for poverty and the role ofChristianity in ads
dressing social issues,

Christina Wagner '09, another Segue organizer, felt there
was a negative perception of Christianity and its relation to the
pooria miconception that she hoped the events would dispel.
Wagner said this perception was incorrect, that Jesus preached
“what you do to the least ofthesc you do unto me."

According to GCCF, its concern for poverry extends well
beyond rhe exhibit. The group is, for example. fundraising for
Kids Againsr Hunger, an organization that sends food aid to
starving people around the worldThey made over 5400 at the
Quad dinner alone,

“A lot ofrrmcs rcl ion, and especially Chiistianlty, is sepa-
rated from social justice when really in the Bible rlrerc is a very
strong component of social justice," said said Wagner “It’s an
integral part ofthe Christian faith.”
