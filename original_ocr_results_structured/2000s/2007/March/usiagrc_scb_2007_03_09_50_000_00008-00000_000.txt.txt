Babel (2006)
*it* it

Impressive film meditates on,
is lost in translation ‘

Babe/s plotlinc and title convey the film’s primary
predicament: the breakdown otiauguage across cul-
tures. The film is the final mmmiw 771m! in Mexican
director Alejandro Gonzalez lnritritu’s “death trilogy,"
which includes two ofhis earlier works' 1417mm Pli'i'ol’
and 2] Gi-a'mr. Its organic and intricate interplay of
images, sounds and themes yields something close to
cinematic poetry.

Using Inarnnis iccognizable style of fractured
storytelling, Balm/juxtaposes four stotics set in loca—
tions ltctoss'the globe, Each story spraivls out across
the map—and the movie itself~like the exploded
fragments ofan ignited powder keg.

Barri begins with a wealthy American couple,
Richard (Brad Pitt) and Susan (Cate Blanchett), tour
ing Morocco on a bus. At the same time, two teenag-
ers (Boubker Ait El Caid 8c. Said Tarchani), who live

nearby in the arid Moroccan foothills, toy with a riﬂe -

their father gate them to fend offpredzltors from the
sheep they are guarding. Bored, they the shots at rare
dom targets: jackais, parched rocks and a passing tour
bus. As a result, Susan, who is sitting in the bus, is
wounded and later taken to a remote village where she
and Richard wait for medical assistance

Concurrently, in san Diego, Amelia, a Mexican
nanny (Adriana Barraza) to Richard and Susan’s chilr
dren (Elle Farming and Nathan Gamble) is forced
to take the two young Americans across the border
to celebrate her son's wedding. Meanwhile, in ja-
pan, a dearenaite teenager named Chieko (Rinko
Kikuchi) struggles to live her life as an average adoe
lescent. Shadowed by the mysterious suicide of her
mother, her own isolation, and her concerned father
(Koji Yakusho), Chicko wanders Tokyo with friends
and strangers, walking the uiban bedrock along busy
streets, surrounded by the lonely wlow ofncon signs

Thc stories are knit togctliei through various
plot points, and ill the coincidences and accidents
might be ottepiitting for an audience member. The
entire scenario seems impossible. However, Bale] is
concerned not with realism, but with insisting on the
gravity of each emotional event. Enamored with the
terrible possibilities of tragedy, Inarrini and screen-
writer Guillermo Arriaga work to express the complie
cared relationship between love and death, conclud~
ing that love, specifically that between a parent and a
child, speaks as the universal and enduring vernacular
of hum'mlty

Babel isnt afraid to illuminate what it values. lts
ambition isn’t mobilized through indiiection. Rather,
the film elevates itselfinto the realm ofallegory. Even
then, both the careful cinematography of Rodrigo

m Child (LEN/(i712) is a iiioyic that. while charged

with dramatic potential, keeps its characters at arm‘s

lives day by day from his small-time thievery

Bruno seems to have aged much faster than he has
matured. He displays all the responsibility and moral
values ofa child, a trait emphasized by his criminal
partnership with 14-year-old steve (Je're’mie Segard).
Bruno refuses to get a steady job, insisting that work—

mg is for chumps, but doesn't have a problem begs
ging for change on the streets, or housing his wife
and child in a homeless shelter. As his bad decisions
start to take their toll, Bruno reacts with such naive
astonishment and pathetic attempts to resolve con—
ﬂicts that it’s hard not to feel sorry for him.

The directors, Belgian brothels Jeaanierre and
Luc Dardenne, followed realist tradition in shoot—
ing the tilm very simply. There is no background
music; the only sound is what the characters would
hear (often car noise, since most of the scenes take
place on streets), Sometimes the audience is left to
watch Bruno ciossmg a street, or walking up a ﬂight
of stairs. This is not a movie for those with short at-
tention spans.

The bright side' is that the actors rise beautifully
to the challenge, performing naturally and believably.
Despite this, it is difficult to really connect with the
characters, and it is clear that Bruno is wholly respon-
sible for the situations he finds himselfin.

Rather than hoping that things turn out well for
Bruno, we are left hoping that he will accept respon-
sibility for his life, so that he might eventually find
redemption. Although T12: Child is not without mo-
ments of poignancy, be prepared for intellectual exert
cise rather passive consumption of entertainment.
