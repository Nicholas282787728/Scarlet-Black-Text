The time of year for Brut cologne and gold chains

It's that trrnc of year agarn. The soccer
players are wearing polyester, sunglasses and
grant lapels while they hawk T—shirts outside
the dining hall. The spring draw is takrng its
sweet time and we’re itching for spring. You
tool like you haven't been to l-larrrs enough
this semester, Disco rs upon us.

For me, Disco—with a capital D—represents
the zenith of the Grinncll patty spectrum.
some prefer Fetish or Halloween. malty prefer
Mary B. James. but for me Disco has always

. hold some superror, rnhercnt glamour. Perhaps
because my mother was (and to my father’s
great chagrin, remains) an avid fun of disco,
this affinity of mine has dccpcr roots than I
might acknowledge. i remcmber a particular
afternoon, while preparrng
for my very ﬁrst Disco (The _
Inferno- seniors may recall), Same ptelerFet/sh
I mentioned the party to my
mom and was shocked by
her excitement, and by the
exhaustive nature of her adv
vice. Both her counsel and
second-hand jewelry have
proved invaluable in the years since,

Disgust of others

Recently, some random mnts have pointed
out how disgusting it is when guys pcc with
the stall door open (good golly, don't men to
alize how ttaumatizing it is for others to see
their completely clothed, utterly innocuous
backsides when tlicy’rc performing a natural
bodily function?), or when individuals blow
their noses in thc shower (I can think of few
things coarser than disposing ofmuctls down a
drainl). These rants merely address the symp-
tom oftltc real problem, however. i, personally,
am disgusted at the mere sight ofu student c”,
renug thc bathroom, knowing what vulgar ucts
they surely intend to perpetrate.

Further, the sound of a shower—even bar-
irng distasteful nose-blowing—is disgusting in
and ofitsclf, as ifthcsc students feel it impetus
rive upon tlicmsclvcs to broadcast to all the

many prefer/Wary B. James, but
latme DlSCD has always held some
super/oz inherent glamour

was paved tvrtli a series of the most festive pic-
parties the enjoyed in four years at Grinneii.
I will forever rcmcniber visions of former
SGA President John liohntan be jumping
and dancing wildly in the basement of Blitll’
robe House (now
the Pom), his slitrt
unbiittoned, gold
chains flying. lmct
a lot or people {or
the ﬁrst time that
night, i danced
with strangers and
shared champagne with new acquaintances
somehow, the horrifying scent otBrut cologne.
the sounds otsynth and slap bass, and the sight
ofour classmates gussied up
in vintage clubwear combine
to create something bigger
than the sum of its parts, a
perfect social cocktail.

Last year’s Disco (the
Carwdsh) was a hard-earned
return to beloved Grinnell
traditions after a semester
abroad. By that time, I knew what I was in
tor and could fully appreciate the full Disco

0r Hal/0 ween,

woild that they are (shudder) naked! What
Grinncll studcnts as a whole need to realize is
that the human body is a ﬁlthy, nasty object
that does filthy, nasty things. If wc could all
just agree on this and be properly ashamed of
it, the campus worrld he a rat more acceptable
place to two, ladvrsc all otmy readers to lcccp
in mind that we are not all boors, I, for one,
am a delicate flower, and could do without
constant rcininders that we are, in fact, living,
breathing, pissing, snot-producing organisms.
Thank you,

Comic hilarious

cracking open the champagne on the South

glrng brushes and
the drying fans at
the end of the ens

Sitting throrrgh
pictures of the
past thrcc years’
celebrations, I can
fool mysclfgctting unreasonably excited at the
prospects ofyet another Disco (this year: Disc
co in Space) I've bccn playing the mix CDs,
lovingly burned and mailed by my mother up
in Wisconsin. Softly though, above the tri-
umphant cries ofKool n' the Gangi also hear
a little, taunting voice, “But this is your last
Disco..."

Yes it is. And each consecutive year has
surpassed the one before it, Thrs year I’ll be

of the GLBTQAI community on campus,l
actually thought the comic was hi1arious.The
joke in question was ﬁttrng, as Purim is one
of the most quccrsfricndly Jewish holidays.
Therefore, labelling Chalutzrm’s Purim ads as
“bigotry"would be a grave faux pas. l happen
to have a noanC sense of humor, but that

queersﬁrendly nature ofthc holiday, secondly
he should think more carcﬁlllv before making
such grandiose accusations (“smalls inded

not assume that the GLBTQXI community

One student’s call for assigned seating

Most obviously in my Sociology classes,l
have noticcd a distinct racial division in who
sits with whom.
Even at the recent

panel discussion
“Perceptions of
Race and Inequals
ity at Gtinnell”, it
seemed that, ironi-
cally, the audience
was not truly integrated, These divisions are
symptoms ofa large problem. it is one thrng
to have a multicultural (or multiracial oi mul-
ticlassial, etc.) campus, but it is an entirely
different thing to have a campus frcc ofracral
divisions, stereotypcs and tensions,

While Grinnell has recruited a diverse
student body so that we eat in the same din-
ing hall and attend the some classes as people
wildly different from us,
how many people still make
an effort to meet new pccrs
after the third week of our
ﬁrst semester? Whrle many
events and activities gather
diverse groups, the groups
often remain divided in
the audience, at the discussion table or in the
classroom.

How many people still make an
effort to meet new peels alter the
thlrd week olout lint semeileﬂ

Brrdgrng racial and economic divides rc-
quires more than just placing a collection of

people on a small
plot of land in town,
and so, i believe that
one of the best and
most direct ways to
address the segments
ed student body is to
manually force us to
sit together through the institution of assigned
seating. By our second semester, we all have our
friends that we search for on ‘
the ﬁrst day of classes. We

create an unofficial seating Seanngrhartiineven/(lars
would constant/y expose us to new

chart and that is that. The
boys Ell together, the girls
sit together, inter-national people.
students sit together, white
students
sit together, and so on. In
my mind, it little institu—
tional help could push the
student body, slowly and
surely, toward a more unis
ﬁed campus

I do not mean to say
that students hrwc not attempted to trikc
strides toward solving this problcm — sriitlcnt

groups constantly bring parts of the campus
community together to view cultural movies,
listen to foreign music and eat foreign foods
~ but conditions on campus still leave much
to be desired.

seating charts in every class (maybe even
ones that shift cvcry thrcc to four weeks)
would constantly expose us to new people and
would, bit by bit, take a bite out of the prob
lem or insularity on our campus. Classes are
the place where we often first meet the people
who later become our friends. Even if we do
not become friends with
everyone we sit ncxt to, we
are more likely to sit next to
them at a concert or at least
smile at them in the loggia.
Further-mote, working with
people we would not other
wise interact with forces us
to accommodate different working styles and
a wide range ofopinions.

A counteratgumenr to assigned scars and
groups might articulate that we work bet-
tct with people wc know and, therefore, learn
more. But Grinncll is a liberal arts school. and
if we ncver break out of our comfort zone,
what are we really learning.>
