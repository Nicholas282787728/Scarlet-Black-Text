Something constructive

Random rants shouldnt he inst a place where
angry kids dump their complaints about the
world Lets try something else. When you ate
checking emails on rhe fiathetically fcw corn
punters outside the Grille, have you ever wondered
how to access anywhere other than Outlook Web
Access? Here it goes:

(1) Click the top-right red thingy (even com
would look better than this emblem).

(2) Click the button under the toprright rcd
thingy (thank goodness USNcws doesn't rank -
college website appearance).

(3) Select “Search the Web" (and get ready
for the only time when the college search engine
actually finds what you mm).

You are now in Googlc. You know what to
do next. As Confucius said, “To Inﬁnity and Bo-
yond!”

Less guns needed on campus
Drawing on Grinnell’s past with ROTC 1nd

. shooting ranges, last week Jacob jSsdahl muted

against a wimpy, fearful, ignorance of the 1111111111-
ness of violence permeating this campus, chnn‘r
pinning rhosc halcyon days when gun toting was
cool I dis1gicc. I draw on a more inﬂuential (I
hope) Grinncll tradition: erirital thinking. Put
violence in context. Can you equate assault with a
game? To argue the merits orplayrnl Violence, all
sl Ls must be willing participants. Irwas not out of
“ignorant fear” but reasonable concern for my safety
and the sai'cry of other Grinncllians when, after .I
pickup truck ofstrangers pulled up next to me and
shot me with a pellet gun,1 reported ir to security,
who sent out that memo. Discounting Context and
disregarding other pcoplcs'experiences-4h“! is ig-
norance,
