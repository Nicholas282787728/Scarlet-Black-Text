New campus group
to give micro-loans

BY ARI ANlSFELD

Luciano Cabrera is a tree farmer who needed $1,075 to
pay for fertilizer and machinery on his farm in Baha, Ecua-
dot. Though he lives thousands ofmiles away on an entirely
different continent, members oftlie new student group, Social
Entrepreneurs of Grinnell, intended to raise money to make
the loan for him.

social Entrepreneurs, which was created two weeks ago
by left‘Radcrstroag, who is also opinion Editor for the soda,
aims to supply micrOrloans to entrepreneurs and businesses
throrrghorrt the world The group rs partnerrng with the inter
national organization K' iorg to and prospective borrowers
who require the small loans to finance small-scale agriculture
enterprises or local shops,

The funds for the groups loans wrll eoine exclusively from
donations from the college and comrnunrry. Accordrng to group
member Eric Nost’09, Soeidl Entrepreneurs will start canv
ing on campus within the week to solicit donations. They ni
also place collection cans at Saint's Rest and other business in
town, and apply for Fog Fast, an event through which students
can donate their dining hall meals to help feed the poor.

The entrepreneurs hope to work with other groups on carn-
pus to facilimte grouprdireeted loans, but “at this point [the
Social Entrepreneurs arejust] trying to get off the ground,"said
Elizabeth Jach ’09, another member of the group.

The group originally planned to collect for Cabrera after
they were matched with him. But a few days later, Cabrera re-
ceived his loan from other lenders before Social Entrepreneurs

_ could collect their funds. “We thought we designated our first
person and the next day he was funded in full,” said Iach.

Impressed at how quickly people received loans, the social
Entrepreneurs decided to wait until after they had collected the
money to pick their beneﬁciary. In identifying a borrower, they
will be "looking for somebody in agriculture. ..[who] needs

money to buy

they intend to
tarloan the money and hope to create a longrlerm pool of funds
with which to mrcrofrnance.

Kiva.org, according to its website, is a growing organiza—
tion that “allows you to connect with and loan money to unique
small businesses in the developing world." Lenders choose a
recipient from a selection of prerqualiﬁed entrepreneurs and
businesses. The organization then transfers loans to its “field
partners,” or microﬁnance banks, which then give the money to
the entrepreneurs, Kivaorg has held partners in more than two
dozen countries all over the world.

The organization is funded by donors and does not charge
interest. However, they “intend to be fully selfssustainable by

2008,” and “will begin charging a small (approximately 2%) fee,

to [their] Field Partners in 2007,"aceording to the website.

Though the principal ofthe loan is generally paid back in
full, lenders do not receive interest payments. Microfmance
throughout the world has a 97% rate ofieturn, according to the
United Nations Capital Development Fund, and so far Kiva’s
rate of return rs 100%,

“Making micrOrloans through l<iva.org is “a really great way
ofhelping projects in developing countries get under way with—
out it being a charity,"Nost said. “You can spread out what you
are doing [and] encourage people to invest wisely."

Students upsetkover‘housn‘ig decision

BY CHRIS NEUBERT

For Lindsay Robinson ’09, living in Multicultural Manor
this year has been an inspiring experience. “Multicultural stu-
dents don’t have any space to gather outside of the multicultural
wing, said Robinson “The Manor is homey, and provides a
space for groups that dont have a space Next year, however,
there will be no home offreampus speciﬁcally designated for
multicultural students, after the nine-member Housing Com-
mittee voted last Monday to award collegerowncd houses to
the Frisbee Team, Debate Club, and Dag.

Typically, the offrcumpus housing application process ins
volves two critical components — a proposal and a later prev
sentation. Speaking about the presentation to the committee,
Molly McArdlc '09 said, “We came in confident.., and that
was to our detriment," MoArdlc said that she thought that
“the committee was much more aware of the importance of the
Multicultural Manor than they were... We felt they under-
stood why we necded this safe space." Ultimately, however, the
committee rejected the students proposal for a house, a decir
sion that was reached “out of ignorance toward the multiculs
rural community,” she said. “We are students, not tokens.”

Kim HindsrBrush, Loosehead RLC and member of the
Housing Committee, said the students “never made a eonnec-
tion about why the house was needed and what it would cone
tribute to the community. They talked a lot about what they
were doing this year, but didn't describe next year," she said.
“We couldn’t give them a house with a set of expectations if
they couldn’t provide us with any expectations for themselves.”

Hinds—Brush also said that the students who presented
“talked about what they had done individually, but not what
they had done as a group," The Housing committee did of»
fer the students a themed ﬂoor, and eight of the 15 students
involved in the proposal will be living in Cowles third next year,
McArdlc, however, said that a themed ﬂoor“ is less of a safe
space and in response to the Housing Committees decision,
members of the Multicultural Manor have Wrrttcn a letter of
protest to the committee.

The protest letter ourlrnes many of the events, activities
and contributions to the campus community thatMulticultural
Manor has made this past year and Is included in this week’s

$81? as a letter to the editor. According to Merdle, these
activities included a play, two drag shows, and an HIV/AIDS
awareness week that she felt contributed significantly to their
efforts to connect to the community. The letter also sharply
criticizes Megan Goering ’08, a studentral-latge member orthc
committee, for not excusing herself from the proceedings de
spite what the letter calls an “obvious conflict of interest” stem—
ming from Goering's role as President ofthe Debate Club.

Hinds-Brush disputed that claim. “While technically she
may have had a conflict ofinterest, she didn’t inﬂuence the doc
eision of anyone else," HinderBrush said. “It is unacceptable
that this letter being circulated attacks an indrvrdual member
of the Housing Committee.” According to Hinds-Brush, there
are nine members ot’the committee: two other RLCs,Dean for
Student Life Jen Krohn, three students from SGA and two Mr
large students, who all have an “equal voice and one vote,"

“While it would have made sense to step downl didn’t behave
inappropriately,” Goering said, “I just didn’t think about it."

Both McArdle and Goeting said they are hopeful that this
eontroversy will start a dialogue about multicultural issues on
campus. While the committee initially felt that adequate space
was provided through the Black Cultural Center and the Mule
ticultural suites, Goering said, “There is a need on campus for
a safe space on campus that is not provided... the committee
didn't understand that through the application and presentation
process." Goering was scheduled to meet with students from
Multicultural Manor today to discuss changes to the housing
policy and the need for a safe space. “The need for actual sup
port ofmulriculruralisin on campus is clearer,"Goering said.

MeArdle said she would ﬁrst like to see signiﬁcant
changes to the Housing Committee, to allow some form ofapr
peals process. “This has been erhausting," she said, “We have
been unable to file d formal complaint." In addition, there are
still no definitive plans for a place on campus that the students
ofMulticultural Manor feel would adequately qualify as a safe
space, That leaves students in this year's house disappointed
and disheartened. “The multrcultural community has come tor
gcrhor in an extraordinary way this year, and these relationships
will persevere," McAidle said. “It’s a shame that new ones will
not be added."

Students prepare for this weekend’s room draw

BY ALEX GREENBERG AND CAIT SCHERR

some Grinnell students would find a popvdlffeientinlequur
tions exam more attractive than the upcoming room drdw pro-
cess, students must balance a host ofpcrsonal concerns with a
number ofsocial pressures from friends in deciding where and
with whom to live All of these factors will come into plily this
Sunday as students gather outsrde the Harrrs Center for the
annual room—draw process.

The primary determinant ofwhcrc a student will live next
year is their room draw number. Students with very low room
draw numbers have few options and may have their future room
essentially decided for them. “I have a bad number firstly, and
I found a roommate, but her number is even worse than mine,"
said saida Avupova ‘10. “[So] where were living is not a really
big issue... it's not like we have a lot ofchoice.”

Dean Retinard '10 said she planned on heeding the advice
ofa fellow student who recommended creating a list “of all the
rooms you want [because] that way you can go faster and are
more likely to get something you want,”

While choosing where to live is difﬁcult, Rennard said that

“finding a roommate" is the hardest part of the process The
room draw process often tests relationships as students are
forccd to choose between friends or decide to live alone. Rene
nard and her roommate have not yet discussed their plans in-
depth Others must decide about how close they want to live to
their significant other.

Beyond social issues are the personal needs ofspacc, privacy,
companionship, allergies (for which the East campus dorms
would be safer, for instance) and proximity to one’s academrc or
extracurricular “second home” such as Bucksbaum. Add to that
classrspecific difficulties, such as ﬁnding alternates for your ju-
nior roommate who will be abroad, choosing between on or off
campus housing as a senior,or entering into the process for the
first time as a rising sophomore.

For students living off campus or in themed houses, their
room draw number becomes irrelevant but there are still con—
ccrns, Seine students, for instance, have been frustrated by the
college's procedures for approving offrcampus housing. Steve
Johnson ’08 said that he had been approved for offrcampus
housing for hrs current year as ajunior, but that his application

for offacampus housing for next year was denied.

Molly Thompson '07 also expressed confusion over the
deeisronrmuking process, “I don’t understand why people are
denied in the first place," said Thompson. “it seems arbitrary
to me.”

Other students, like Andrea Albrrght ’09, said that because
of the current process some students will inevitably have to
settle. “someone is goingto get the short end ofthe stick,” she
said. Albright said this was especially true {or those juniors who
are studying abroad and must find a student to share the room
with durrng the different semesters.

But not all students experience problems with room
draw. Thomspon who, along with five other friends, “got lucky
[and was] immediately okay-ed" last year for off-campus hous-
ing despite being abroad during the selection process.

Despite the difficulties of the system, most students
eventually find a room that they are satisfied with and hope in
the meantime for a higher number next year, “I guess certain
things [about the process] don't make sense," chnard said.
“But that willjust come with time"
