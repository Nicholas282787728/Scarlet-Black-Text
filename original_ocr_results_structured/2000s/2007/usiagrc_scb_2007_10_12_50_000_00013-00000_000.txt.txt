Not the frontrunner here

Students for Hillary leaders reveal that Hillary—and maybe Bill, tooiwill be
coming to Grinnell later this year to try to attract student support

quUua BOTTLES
Hillary Clinton continues to climb in the polls, appearing
a dominant frontrunner in the Democratic presidential prima-
ries. But on campus, Clinton seems to be far from a favorite.
“There's a lot less support for Hillary than the other two big
three candidates,"said jordan Levine '09, co-lcadcr of Grinnell
Students for Hillary. “I think she's the

top tier, but on campus she's probably Campaign Noteboo Clinton
third I’d say." ,

Despite her apparent popularity problem, students still
ﬂock to see surrogates speak on her behalf Former secretary
ofState Madeline Alhright came to Grii aell in September to
campaign for her. Earlier in the year, Terry McAulit‘fe, Clint
ton friend and former DNC chair, arrived to otter his support.
Although they could not disclose the names yet, Levine and
Emily Jacobs ’09, the other co-leader of Grinncll Students for
Hillary, hinted that there are some other big names that will be
coming through Grinncll on behalfofClinton,

Jacobs and Levine also revealed that Clinton heiselfwill be
making an appearance at Grrnnell, though the date other vrsir

Despite the glamour of candrdate's and surrogates visits

working since August to get word out about the Clinton earns

We turned the corner, walking briskly past the ride board
and pushing the door open to a welcomed breezei cleared my
throat and glanced both ways before reaching the train tracks
separating the JRC from south Campus.“Sol have this Obama
meeting at 7:30 ...”My voice started ott quietly, knowing that
my prospective student was a conservative from Arizona whose
views about social issues like abortion were, despite the political
debate we’d had in my room a few hours earlier, set in stone.

I was confused when a smile crept across her face and even
more puzzled when her voice, high with that typical I'm-so-ex-
cited-to-be-ar-Grinnell tinge, rose above my own, "OBAMA?
1 love that guy!"

I didn't immediately respond with words, but I'm assuming
my eyebrows did all the talking,

“I mean my parents are hardcore Giuliani lovers, but if he
doesn’t get the Republican nomination and Obama gets past
l-lillary, 1 would deﬁnitely vote {or him over any other Candie
date,"

This was not the first time, nor the last time, that I've heard
something along these lines. Just 45 mrnutcs later, 1 drscovcred

alsojust started with students dialing registered voters on their
cell phones while lounging at German House. Efforts continue
to canvas, poster and phone hank, "We’re deﬁnitely interacting
with the people in the area," says Jacobs.

These tasks are all the more difficult given that younger
demographics are less enthusaastic about Clinton. “In the 18s
[42]-yenr-olds there isn‘t a lot orsupporr
for Hillary Clinton, and most ofthe sup
port comes from the aseplus. So were
kind otrarc in the fact that we're supporting her,"

A lack ofenthtisiasm from their peers hasn't deterredjacobs
or Levine. Both are rnterns for Clinton's “Hill Yea!" program
that seeks to train Iowa students to whrp tip support for the
senator. As interns on the campaign, Jacobs and Levine have
already played a large role in the citort in Poweshiek County,
and they plan to expand their activities.

One ofjacobs and Levine’s biggest responsibilities is mole
bilizing the volunteers that carry out tht- necessary tasks in
getting to vote our. Emily said, “were in charge ofall of the
volunteers, so our ioh is going to be, especially after Fall Break,
to get more people to volunteer for the carnpargn so we can get
more done,"

Although then support group on campus might be smaller
than other campaigns,lacobs and chint rhrnk that their role
untccrs :u‘c up to the rack at hand. “i think what sot rs apart
is that we've got moi-c people on the ground .rnd w to more

Grnrncll students for Hrllary are still hopetirl that students
will come around to e l’llllmy Clinton as the best candidate

the White House, not just putting a good candidate to win the
nomination. That is our number one goal. \Ne’re not looking
for another John Kerry or- Al Gore. We’re looking to go all the
way this time,"

it was certain

that Obama not only is viewed as the most wellclikcd, charisc
matic candidate out ofcither party, but also that he is the third
choice candidate {or Republican caucuchoers, a ranking that
separates him from any ofhis opponents.

All of this informationﬁftom my prospie’s passionate rant
to the empirical evidence I was offered later that night—moves
me to support Obama like never before. in a divided nation, he
is the only candidate who can trlily bring people together, not
only within the Democratic Party but also across party lines.

1 encourage all ofyou SéfB'ers not only to like Obama for
his handsome good looks and his genuine, down~ttreartla per-
sonality, but also to watch how he brings people together, There
are plenty of opportunities to gain a better understanding of
what Obama’s all about.

In my mind, this election is not about settling on a candi-
date, it’s about putting someone in office who cart make every
one excited about politics again. In my mind, that someone is
Obaina and I'm ready for him to Barrack our worlds.

“Desperate”
campaigning

Cate Edwards, sit—
com plumber visit
campus

By SARAH MIRK

Saturday afternoon, students
and older town members packed a
corporate—feeling room on the sees
and ﬂoor of the IRC, Some brought
notebooks and questions, others
brought cameras to snap photos otthe two Edwards campaign
notables who'd drawn them there: Cate Edwards, daughter of
the more famous John, and James Denton, the studly plumber
from “Desperate Housewives."

Cate Edwaids, 25 and a student at Harvard Law, was re-
fleshingly ungroomed in her responses, stumbling through
some responses and losing track of her thoughts like a not"
inal human rather than one of the soundbite-emitting robots
who litter the campaign trail.Alrhough shc campaigned for her
father in 2004, Edwards said she received “Zero training" this
time around and w. a little i-tisry At times, she was hesitant to
answer questions, a rid otmaking a mistake, and deﬂected au-
dience members to gcr ini‘ormatrorr from a man named Oliver,
who stood in the corner wrth a notepad and professional an.

do much morc than get people in the room and then tousle
his hair at them while listenrng intcntly to the main speaker,
Cate Edwards, but he did talk foi roughly ﬁve minutes about
Edwards’s electabilty. A Tennessceebom Republican, Denton
now supports Edwards, saying, “Not only do I agree with him,
but he can win."

Cate Edwards and Denton have been sent out to help the
Edwards campaign drum up college support, Their weekend
tour across town began saturday morning among crowds of
(already drinking) Hawkeye fans at a giant University otloun
tailgate party which was “mostly girls running after James" as
Ms. Edwards described it. After stopping at Grinnell, the duo
was headed to Des Moines to get out the starcstruek female
youth vote by joining a Democratic happy hour.

Young, attractive speakers are part of Edwards’ new “Innoc
vative Outreach" campaign, which revolves around promoting
Edwards via Myspace, Facehook and, yes, text messaging. The
organizers ot' the Grinnell campus Edwards group advertised
their event on Facehook Via the ecstatic invite, “Meet Desperate
Housewives Starlames Danton and Care Edwards!"”l””ll!!"

Grinncll might not be the best place for gathering young
caucus voters, however, since the caucus will fall over Grinnell’s
winter break, when the majority of Grinnelli-ans will be home
outside the state. If every Iowan student votes, that's still under
200 potential voters. Cate Edwards didn’t seem fazed when I
asked her whether she felt stopping by such small colleges is a
waste of precious campaign time.“1've been working for four
years to get young people involved when it had nothing to do
with the caucus," Ms. Edwards said. “Now it also has to do with
diawing young Voters to the general election."
