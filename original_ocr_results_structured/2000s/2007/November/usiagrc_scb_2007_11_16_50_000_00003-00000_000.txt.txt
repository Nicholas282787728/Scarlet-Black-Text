Science librar

hours extended

After its first few months open, stu ents find new library to be a comfortable
place to study despite inconvenient operating hours that have since changed

By An Salaam-r

The new Kistle Science Library, with its graffiti-free walls
and neWebuilding smeu, is a pleasanr srudy environment for
anyone looking to clear their head, Klstle opened at the start of
this year, a welcomed improvement from the cramped fourth
floor of Burling that until previously had been masquerading as
a science Library. As students adjust to studying and researching
in the new space, concerns about the availability of rhe library
and access to resources prompted library administrators last
Thursday to extend the hours of operation.

Located on the second ﬂoor on the recently completed
Phase II section of Noyce, the science library attempts to pres
vide a welcoming study atmosphere for all students. In addition
to scientific reference books,journals and periodicals, facilities
include study carrels, meeting rooms, a photocopier, printer and
scanner and 13 dualrboot computers. For some students, this
attention to creating a comfortable study space is a welcome
alternative to Burling Library. "It’s a lot closer to where I live,"
said Anna McCoy ’10,who comes to the library every day after
class. “I’m pretty much here until it closes,"

“Burling’s far, there’s no lighting and its ugly," added Laura
Garcia ’11.

Student complaints about timing, however, convinced ad-
ministrators to extend the closing times from Sunday through
Thursday to midnight. “I think they're aware ofstudcnr com-
plaints and they really try hard to address them," said student
librarian Rosemarie Offord'DS.“Extending hours during critic
cal study weeks would be nice."

Still, most students want even more time, especially during
the weekends when the science library closes at 5 pm. Student
librarian Geoffrey Jacobs '09,who opens the library at 1 pm. on
Sundays, said there is often a crowd lurking around Noyce waits
ing to use the space. "Right now it’s mainly an issue offunding,"
said Jacobs. Fundingwill only be increased when students make
it clear that they would take advantage of extended hours.

And employees insist that they are consistently evaluating
and reporting on library usage. “Every hour we walk around
and count up how many people are using the library,"said stu»
dent librarian Ian Bishop ’10.

“It's mostly just computer use that gets crowded," added Ja-
cobs. “And group study rooms are taken up most ofthe time.“

As long as the new library continues to attract students, Jar
cobs and the other librarians hope that funding will increase
and the library will successfully address students needs.

lntl. recruitment
facing changes

EV DANIEL MOSKOWITZ

After srudcnrs recently passed an initiative demanding
need-blind admissions for international students, the office of
Admission has given renewed artcnrion to the process of iris
ternational recruitment. Though the administration may not
commir to any needeblind policy, discussions are underway and
the recruitment of international students continues to face new
challenges.

As other Englishrspenking countries have entered the mar—
kct wrth lower tuition bills and simplified visa standards, com-
petition has become increasingly fierce for the top international
students. Jon Edwards, the new coordinator of International
Admission, said that much like domesric admission, successful
international recruitment relies on convincing prospective in-
ternational students that Grinnell would be a comfortable fit.

“Students are going to go where they feel most welcome,"
he said,

While domestic and international admissions share similar
recruirmenr techniques, a campus Visit is a primary goal of do
mcstic admissions. For international students, visiting campus
is generally not feasible, and the office must redouble their efe
forts to bring Grinnell to prospective international students.

Edwards is considering making a DVD that would allow
for international students have a better feel for the campus

since most are unable to visit.

He added that since many pro~

spective international students

know little about the Midwest,

a visual presentation may pro-
vide them with a better understanding.

In this competitive and restricted environment, Edwards
and the office of Admission have no easy task at hand in spread-
ing the word about Grinnell. One of the primary methods
that the ofﬁce utilizes is establishing relationships with college
counselors at international schools.

Camila Alarcon Cordon '08 of Guatemala first heard about
Grinnell from her high school counselor. Alarcon Cordon said
that in her opinion, “recruitment for international students is
not good.”

"I was never contacted," she said. “International students
come here mosrly by chance."

Saugar Sainju 'oe ofNepal first heard about Gtinnell from
his college counselor, who went to Princeton. She told Sainju
and his classmates about the “special scholarship opportunity"
that Grinnell offers for Nepali students. Both Alarcon Corr
don and Sainju decided to apply to Grinnell after hearing from
counselors at their schools or talking with family members who
new about the college.

"The college needs more active recruitment," said Alarcon
Cordon,

In order to develop a more active recruiting stance and fos-
ter relationships with international guidance counselors, Ed-
wards is frequently traveling to schools around the world. At
times by himself, but earlier this year, he traVcled to India with
admissions officers from a large group oforhcr schools, and he
just recently traveled to Norway, Wales, Bosnia, Italy and Serbia
with a group of other administrators from liberal arts colleges.

Because the concept ofa liberal arts education is unique to
the United States, while other countries’ educational systems
are more vocationally focused, Edwards said it could be “tough
to explain the beneﬁts” ofa liberal arts education, He said he
would like to consider profiling international student nlllms to
illustrate the positive outcomes ofa Grinnell Liberal arts educue
tion.

Nancy Mily '61, interim director ofAdmission and the first
coordinator of International Admission, said that this element
of international recruitment is a long-standing and essential
policy “This college has always becn supportive from the rop-
down ofthe recruitment ofintcrnational students,"shc said.

Maly said many schools do not have rhc funding for travel,
so they rely strictly on the use of “armchair rccruirincnr tech
niques." Grinnell also uses these tools in sending both printed
and electronic materials to prospective international students
and schools, but the personal roneh gives Grinnell a needed
edge.

Additionally, Edwards wants to find ways to incorporate
interested study abroad students in the recruitment process.
He said the office would reimburse the costs associated with
recruitment trips.

Ultimately, while no decision has been reached about the
future of necd-blind international admissions, the Admission
office hopes that by personalizing the iecruitment process, pres
spective international students will be convinced that Grinnell
is a welcoming and viable place to develop personally and pro-
fessionally.
