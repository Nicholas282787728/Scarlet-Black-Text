Which would you prefer: paper, plastic or propaganda?

The most succcssaii campus campaign
isn‘t run by SGA, noi does the most succesy
ful campaign support SGA‘s puppet dictator,
Wedge Antilles. No: the leafyrgtccn folks of
Free the Planet take home the prize.

It seems that since the time FTP fell like a

nut from Yggdrasil, the Norse Tiec of Life. its
mission has been to pollinatc our minds with
spores of propaganda: save power, paper and
perhaps even our blemished souls, beating the
original sin of the devcloped world. At times,
it’s overwhelming.

But plcase,don't
misundei stand my cynicism I loved T/rc Lﬂl'llx
and i have a great deal ofrespect for FTP prcc
cisely because they have been more successful
in their campaigns than anyone else. They've
brought us tccycling rooms, turned wasted pa-
pcr into notebooks and have had an incicdr
ibly positive, concrete impact on the trustees’
decision to build wind turbines, all of these
wonderful srcps in reducing our environmeir
tal impact.

My concern is not that we help our the
envuonment; it's that we are told to help out
regardless of the costs. FTP is certainly not

the only organization that packages recycling
is a moral imperative, beyond the veil of rear
son. Recyclers seem to say, “C'nion, guys. We
HAVE to SAVE the Earth from our garbage."
As if I don’t have better things to do?

In the words ofChazv, Miller, an editor of
thc Klgldirlg Timer, “[Rccyeling] should be a
business, not a religion " The uninentioned
part of the argument to recycle are the costs,
which air real and significant

Curbside ieeycling programs have mas
sivc costs arising
{mm the extra
vehicles, fuel and
labor needed to
pick up recyclable
and non-recyclable
garbage. The New
Yeti Timer rcporrr
ed in 1996 that, in NYC, it is three times more
cxpenstve to collect a ton of recyclables than
disposable garbage. With recyclables, each
stop yields less material Every ton of glass,
plastic and metal costs the city 5200 more
to recycle than to bury in a landfill (more on
landﬁlls later),

ifyou hope the city can recoup its expenses
by selling the recyclables, think again: recy»
cling centers often charge a fee to process the
material because the resale value ofrlie mate
ml is so much lower than the input value. By
2002, the cost of recovering a ton of material

was down to sioo,whieh is still grossly ineffir
cicnt, especially considering that NYC should
be beneﬁting from economics of scale. The
city could do more good for its environmcnt
by paying for litter collection and then burying
garbage instead oftvasting the money on fuel
and trucks.

Burying garbage in landfills makes more
economic and environmental sense than any
alternative. Landﬁlls have become a profitable
busmcss of areas with lots
of land (such as Grinnell),
which can import garbage
fiom cities like New York.
They exchange their land
for jobs and tar revenue.
Currently, 45 states import
garbage from 47 states that
expoit itThcsc landﬁlls do
not take up nearly as much
space as one might expect. ifAmtricans cont
tinuc to produce garbage at the current rate,
a land fill 300 feet deep and 10 miles squared
could contain all ofour refuse for the next cent
tury.
And burying garbage is not as environ-
mentally damaging as we've been lead to
believe. Modern landﬁlls must satisfy strict
EPA guidelincs, which have proven effeec
tiv at environmental protection Clay and
plast led landﬁlls almost never leak, and
when they reach capacity, they're covered in

My amtern is not that we help
out the environment; it’s that we
are told to he/p out regardless of

dirt and grass and turned into innocuous parks
or developments, Superfund sites, which do
threaten the environment, occur when compar
nies illegally dump a hazardous material into
municipal landfills instead of properly dispos-
ing of it. Even recycling can’t stop cheaters.
Most times, though, garbage never leaves the
dump. Because there's very little biodegradar
tion in the compacted, oxygen-deficient land-
ﬁlls, chemicals don’t enter the water table and
organic compounds don‘t
decompose to release
methane or carbon dioxide.
Everybody’s a winner at
the dump.

Over fall break, Grinnellian Anita went to visit her boyfiiend on the East
Coasr for a week, She spent her vacation at another school. in other dorms and
eating in other dining halls. In between reminiscing and steamy dates, she spent
her time wandering around unfamiliar dorms and trying to make friends with a
pair of cantankerous roommates. '

One day Anita went for a run in town before the
boyfriend returned from class, it was a gorgeous day
and the foliage was just beginning to emerge. She
ran for a while on sidewalked, suburban streets, and
then ran underneath a bridge. Once on the other side
of the bridge the neighborhood shifted. As she ran
by in pink running shorts listening to Andrew Bird
on her iPod there were people staring at her.

She ran by an apartment complex. A man on his porch began walking to
wards her waving his hands and gesturing. But immediately, Anita realized it
was not friendly gesturing, but an obscene statement directed at her rear end.
Anita kept running hoping he would just stop and she could get back to campus.
But he began to follow her, Adrenaline kicked in and she was no longer stiain-
ing to run the last mile; she was sprinting trying to get back to the other side of
the bridge. A few other people noticed a girl in pink running shorts ﬂeeing from
a man walking behind and joined in the jcering.

By this point Anita's cycs had begun to water and she was thinking about the
suburbs ofGrinnell. In a desperate attempt to ward off the pursuer, Anita ran up
to a nearby fire truck and looked up at the man sitting inside, She couldn't hold
it in any longer and she started bawling uncontrollable into the stranger's face.

Remember that lime

In the midst of sobs and stammers, she told the ﬁreﬁghter that someone was
following her anti she didn't know how to get back.Thc bewildered fireman got
out of his truck and walked With Anita, back to the bridge, He suggested that
maybe she should stay on the other side from now on. Anita thanked him and
ran back to campus, not looking forward to the looks
of shock the roommatcs' faces when she came back
sweaty and tear-stained.

Unfortunately,l know exactly what this situation
feels like in real life and then it's hard to think about
anything but the intense fear. But when i first heard
Anita’s story I could barely hear the whole thing as
I choked on my own laughter. I like to tell this story
because it ends in awkwardness and sheepishness. It
reminded me of the safety lessons 1 received in elementary about screaming,
“Stranger Danger, you are in my personal spacci"

My first reaction would have been to act like I was an extremely dangerous
person. I would have run faster, puffed out my chest and attempted to exude
sticngth and confidence. 1 probably would have yelled obscenitics back in the
direction ofthc man, only getting myselfinto more troubleAlthough (as many
ofyou know) I will challenge anyone to a physical fight, in real life this might
not be a good idea. Anita followed the protocol perfectly and for the simple fact
that she left the incident behind only to chuckle at herself, I laugh with her,

After break as we walked to the gym, iPods in hand, she told about me her
only concern about that day. The fireman did not offer her a ride back in the
fire truck.
