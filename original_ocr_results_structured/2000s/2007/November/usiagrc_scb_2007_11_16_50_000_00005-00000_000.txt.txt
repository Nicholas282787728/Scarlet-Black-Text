New professors adjusting to campus

iii/Antsy thi-oronT

With pro-registration cndrng again yes-
terday. seemingly little had changed from last
semester. Students are stressed about getting
into classes, and Registrar Gerald Adams has
once again assured students there will not be
onlinc registration in any foreseeable future.

But new professors are no longer sources
ofstrcss and uncertainty. As second semester
approaches, many students feel more comfort»
able signing up for classes with new faculty,
given their teaching reputations from this SC,
mester.

Katie Johnson ’08, who rs currently taking
three classes with new professors, was initialT
1y concerned about the new classes that had
replaced her initial schedule. But she found
as the semester progressed, hcr professors be-
came more accustomed to a discussionrhcavy
style ofteaching “The professors need time to
figure out the Grinnell dynamic,"she said,

Erin Duran ’09, who is also taking a class
with a new professor, agreed. “I don't know
how familiar [my professor] was coming in
what how things work at Griiinell,"shc said.

Even professors with a clear sense of lib-
eral arts colleges have to adjust. Rob Lewis,

History, arrived this year after having attended
Carleton and taught at Oberlin. “I felt like I
had a basic idea ofwhat students would be like

,. and what we'd be able to do in class." he
said.

But Lewrs agreed that some adjustment
was necessary. “It’s been exciting for me to ad-
just to a much more discussion-oriented class,"
he said, “and that’s something I want to keep
going into spring."

Bccausc of the steep learning curve, hoWr
ever, Johnson thinks that new faculty should
wait on teaching advanced classes until they've
spent a semester at Grinnell, “There are some
that I think are still figuring it out [first semest
ter],” she said.

For the most part, students like the Grinncll
hiring process, and try new professors with op-
timism. “I've been trusting that Grinnell does
a good job at finding new faculty," Johnson
said, noting that Lewis in particular has “fills
the void in the History department that was
left when Professor Spohnholtz left,"

Lewis, as a new faculty member, has had
good experiences as a new professor. “The stu-
dents have met or exceeded my expectations
across the board," he said. Lewis also noted

the flexibility the History department gave
him in his teaching. “[The department] gives
us a lot offrecdom," he said.

Many also note the advantages of new face
ulty. “A new professor coming to Grinnell is
always excited,"sald MikeTtan’OB. “Although
they don't have the experience, they’re eager to
work with you."

Johnson has had similar experiences. or
her five classes with new faculty, she has liked
four. “They'rc some of my favorite professors
here," she said

But despite such experiences, students gent
erully prefer taking classes when they know a
professor’s reputation.

“If I had to choose between two professors,
one experienced, one not, teaching the same
class," said Tran, “I’d definitely go for the ex-
perienccd one."

With new professors, Johnson noted. "you
never know how it’s going to turn out."

Duran looks forward to next semester,
when new professors have fully adapted, and
students know what to expect of them. “We
need to be mindful that Grinnell’s a very dif-
ferent place,” she said, “and it's going to take
some time to adjust"

Grinnell Corps goes
down on the Big Easy

HY STEPHANIE NORDSTROM

Grinnell’s homegrown service corps will be adding a new location to its list
of established service sites This February, applications will be acceptcd for a
Grinnell Corps fellowship during the 20084009 school ycar in New Orleans.
Unirke other Grinnell Corps programs, only one fcllow will be sent to New
Orleans per year.

The program Gtinncll Corps ultimately settled on rs the Jericho Road Epifr
copal I—lousing Initiative, a nonprofit affordable housing developer in New or
leans. According to Doug Cutchins, associate director of Post Graduate Service
and scholarships, Jericho Road was chosen because they were most “enthusias-
tic" about the program.

Money was set aside in this year’s budget for an addition to Grinnell corps,
and so in September Cutchins spoke with four organizations in New Orleans.
He approached the organizations asking them,“What would you have a Grinnell
Corps fellow do for you?"

Expansion of Gtinnell Corps is nothing new, and growth has long been
institutionalized. “It's been a stated goal of the college—it's in the strategic
planito expand the Grinncll corps,"said Cutchins.

still, establishing a new program is not without its challenges. “it takes a
lot ofwork and time and energy to create a new Grinnell Corps program," said
Cutchins.

“There's a strong Grinnell presence down there," said Elizabeth Carrier
'07, a leader of ReNew Orleans who has done a lot ofvolulitecr work in New
Orleans. “You hear that it's bad, and then you go down there and it’s worse than
you imagined."

Demonstrated student interest also played a critical role. “When you create
a program, you want to create one that you know is going to be appealing in
students,"said Cutchins.

Going to Chicago?

av DRAKE BALLEW

A new service to bring a regular bus route to Chicago from
Grinncll promises to ease student travel stress before breaks and
on weekends. On Friday, Nov. 9, the first ofwhat will be week-
ly bus trips departed from in front of the Roscnfreld CCntctr
Thanks to this service. students who are having trouble frnding
a ride back to the Chicago area for winter break or even those
who simply want to take a weekend and vrsrt the city can do so
at much less ofan inconvenience.

The bus service has been arranged by Burlington Trailways
Transportation system. “There’s already an existing scheduled
route," said Trailways Sales Manager Trevor Olson, "and we
thought it would be beneﬁcial for Grinncll College students."
Buses will depart from the Rosenfreld Center at 4 pm. each
Friday afternoon and arrive back on campus at 10 p.m. on Sun
day night. The fare is 345.50 each way, and stops in Iowa City,
Davenport, Moline, Naperville and Chicago.

The idea to run the service through Grinnell came from
Trarlways itself "Trailways just called us out of the blue and
wanted to see ifwe wanted to be a part of the route," explains
Dean for Student Life Jen Krohn.

“[Facilities Management] thought is was a great idea," adds
ed Olson. “The college says there’s a need, and it makes sense
to stop."

Such a bus service to the college has been long—awaited by
almost all students, not just the many Grinnellians from the
Chicago area. “Catching rides to O'Hai'e can really be a pain,”
said New Yorker Marc Armbruster ’09. “This line should help
everyone out,"

Olson is optimistic that the new service will be successful
“I’ve already had scventl emails about the service." Olson said.
“VVoi'd is getting around,”
