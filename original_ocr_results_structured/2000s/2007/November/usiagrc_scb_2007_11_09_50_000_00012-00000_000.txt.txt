Forget esperanto: smut is universal language

Lets face it. My picvitius columns liavc boon to

in, sex dominates AlnL‘l’l’
can culture. It’s just that
everyone has thc good tastc not to mention it. Dcspitc
the overwhelming silence, I am forced to conclude
that Americans aie either playing a very big joke on
me, or that underneath that veneer of disapproval,
America isjust as kinky as the next nation’smtc.

When you got right down to it, Americans are a
pcrvcrtcd pcoplc. Not as pcrvcrtcd as, say, the Greeks,
wlio havc morc sex than any other country (I guess
olives and feta arc aphrodisiacs), but, still, Amcricaris
put up good stats in terms of the horizontal mambo.

But how dccp does thc rabbit hole go? 1 dccids
