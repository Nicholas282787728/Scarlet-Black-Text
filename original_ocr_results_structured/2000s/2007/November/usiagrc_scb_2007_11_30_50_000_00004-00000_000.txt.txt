Harry Potter;
(2 007)

Fifth Harry Potter film good
enough even for non-fans
(and it’s playing at Quad!)

A disclaimer: I am not a huge Harry Pot»
ter fan. In fact, I have only read the first two
books. And neithei do I believe that a movie is
necessarily inferior to the book it is based on.

Having said that, the ﬁfth installment in
the Harry Potter movie franchise (Hﬂl'l'y Pvt-
ler and M: Order aft/J: Phoenix) is one of the
best of the series and Potter fans can take some
satisfaction in a sleek, swift and exciting adapt
tation of the novel.

The movie begins. as most of the otlk
ers have, with a spot of unpleasantncss at the
Dursieys, and ends with Harry facing down
Lord Voldemort. The climactic battle between
the young wizard (Daniel Radclifre) and the
Dark Lord (Ralph Fiennes) foreshadows a ﬁ-
nal showdown in Book Seven.

Director David Yates explores the themes
of power, deception and deeeit, which depicts
a wizard world rife With factionaljsm and
threatened by chaos and inﬂexible authoritarr
anism.

While Cornelius Fudge. the Minister of
Magic (Rohcrt Hardy, maintains his highly
suspect denial ofVoldemott’s return, a coup at
Hogwarts threatens the benevolent adminise
tmtion ofAlbus Dumbledore (Michael Gam-
hon). Harry, meanwhile, has gone from prince
to pariah,smeared in the magical press (where
his name is rendered "Harry Plotter”) and
subject to cold states and whispers at school.
in this episode, the boy, ityou can still call him
that, encounters the darker side offame.

One ofthe best aspects of the movie is its
swiftness (the fact that it is shortest movie of
all five in thc franchise, despite being based on
the longest book).Thcrc is no Qlidditch, and
not many boarding school diversions.

Instead, the movie, which begins like a horn
tor ﬂick with a Dementor attack in a subur-
ban underpass, proceeds as a tense rind twisty
political thriller, with clandestine meetings,
bureaucratic skullduggery and intimations of
conspiracy hanging in the air.

Harry’s character development is another
highlight of the movie. The movie demon»
strates that the pressures of being designated
a hero havc begun to weigh on Harry, isolate
ing him from his friends and coming between
him and thc possib ity of a normal teenage
life. 11: also experiences his ﬁrst kiss with Cho
Chang (Katie Leung) in one of rho {cw light
moments of the movie.

There are some wonderful special cttccrs-
aided set pieces—notably an early broomstick
ﬂight over Londoniand the sound effects are
not overdone. And the production design and
the cinematography are frequently astonishing
in their aptness and sophistication,

On the flip side, the first 20 minutes ofthe
ﬁlm, when Harry is put on trial for performing
magic outside otschooi and threatened with
expulsion but is cleared of all charges, does
nothing to advance the plotr
