Dodgeball, gimmicks and all, returns to Grinnell

BYJULIA BOTTLES

Two years ago, a league formed that otrcred
students the chance to show off their wilincss
in an opportunity most haven‘t had since the
fifth grade. Every Monday and Wednesday 15
teams gather in the Darby Auxiliary Gym to
test both skill and strength in the most noble
ofintrrimural athletic pursuits: dodgcball.

Dodgcball works well as an intramural bee
cause it's a simple game. Two teams orsix each
chuck soft,ycllow balls at each other, trying to

~ pick off the opposition. A hit to any part of
the body is considered an out. Teammates can
bring players back into the game by catching
a ball orr or the opposing teams throw. Play
ends when a side is completely eliminated or
ﬁve minutes passes'.

several elements of intramural dodgeball
jump out at the casual spectator. The most no-
ticeable is that teams are comprised ora wide
variety of students. Although some teams
have athletes looking for sports to play in the
oFfrseasonirhe team Soc Big is comprised
exclusively of football playersin-iost groups
simply pull enough players from a group or
friends to form a team.

Then there are the team names. With
GrinneLl’s varsity teams sporting names like
the Purple R005 and Skullcrushers, it is hardly
surprising that dodgehall teams do the same.
The Colbert Nation, Hawaiian Punch Gravity
Bong, Balls to the Wall, and the Sweatband
Maﬁa ate all teams in the league. -

Although some traditions remain constant
in Grinnell dodgeball, new student coordinar
torJacob Danknet’ll did make some notable
changes this year. “I shortened the games [and]
made very speciﬁc rules trying to get every-
thing very organized," he explained.

The biggest change in rule: is that players

starting pitching—With the impendr
ing retirement of Andy Perrirrc, the top two
starting pitchers on the market are (drumroll)
Carlos Silva and Kyle Lohse. Quick, what
reams did they play for this year? By the hamr
mcr ofThor,l hope youi team doesn't need to
bolster the rotation with these gems. Rational
people would offer these guys one year, 54.5
million ﬂyels, but since the tree agent market
did away with rationality about four years ago,

two teams will be really disappointed come
June.

Torij Hunterivvhile I'm glad I got to
watch Hunter these past few years, it’s time for
him, his bum ankle and the Twins to move on.
His defense has been on the decline, and even
though he had a career year hitting last year, he
was still overpaid at $12 million. Keep this in
mind when after your team gives him a five-
year $75 million contract, he swings wildly at
breaking balls, and his aging legs prevent him
from making all those highlight reel catches
you expected him to. Look for the Rangers
to get him when they continue their streak of
ov)crpaying center ﬁcldcrs (see Gary Matthews
lr.

Kosuke Fukudomﬁrrobably the only
Japanese player to make an impact this year,
he's been widely touted as a Bobby Abreu type
(read: patient), but with less power. But really
he’s only on this list because I hope he signs
on a team whose announcers are terrible at
pronouncing foreign names, which is almost a
guarantee. It's tookoodouglrmay, if you’re
somehow above the childish phonetic pronunr
ciation. Which means 1 will be giggling child—
ishly throughout the summer.

expands three sizes, but instead orsitting down
with the VVhos fol Chiistmas ioast beast, it
explodes from all or the supplements he's been
taking.

no longer sprint to the mid—court line, emu-
lating the hit movie DMgeba/I, to pick up the
balls. Instead, each team starts at the far of the
court with three balls each.

Along with the alterations to the rules,
Danker tried to ensure that refereeing on the
sidelines improved as well. “The whole pmr
ccss is kind ofstreamlincd,” he said.

Banker’s work might seem like overkill for

an intramural league, but many of the students
take playing seriously. When asked what 500
Big’s team strategy was, Mike Connolly ’11
answered simply: “Dominate".

Luis Arizpe '08 from The Spectre Bret
tors factitiously said, “We basically just want
to destroy the other team We want to use
intimidation." Indeed, every Spectre Erector
comes equipped with a bottle ornike blood to

each oftheir matches,

Veterans “And the Chuckcrres" combine a
recognizable gimmick with a cunning game
plan to create one of Grinnell’s most unique
and recognizable teams, “It’s a strategic advan—
tage for us to wear tight short shorts and wife
beaters,” said Josh Weber ’09, “because then
there's less clothes for other people to hit."
