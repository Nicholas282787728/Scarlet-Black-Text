More should be done to attract excellent RLCs

Over the course or this week, students across campus have
been submitting surveys to review the quality of their Resi-
dence Life Coordinators (RLCs). Student feedback about
RLCs is essential; they have an important and unique role on
campus. Every year there is an unacceptable disparity in the
ability and job performance or RLCs.

Even the most qualified applicant would find it difﬁcult
to balance all their responsibilities while simultaneously acclie

collcgc should provide more rcsourccs to help RLCs in fulfills
ing their responsibilities such as better
training in crisis management or the
aid of a support staff. Administrators
should provide broad guidelines to help
each RLCs understand their function

But the requirements of the job

The school should start by increasing salaries and other perks.
The collcgc could consider providing RLCs with separate living
arrangements, or at the very least, a scparatc entrance. Creative
and aggressive strategies are required to attract and maintain
quality RLCs. A larger applicant pool means more candidates

Attempting to unlock the secrets of Central America

an informational session about all the terrible

dealing with the common houseslock.

On my first day of classcs in Costa Rica,
my host mother issued me a key to the barred
gate that surrounded the house I was able to
open the gate with ease, but when I tried to
shut it, the sucker lust would not close. For
several minutes I ﬁddled, I finessed, 1 sweet

Suddenly it dawns on in: that I don't know

With sufficient practice,I was able to open

accidcntally lock my key inside the room on
four separate occasions, to get caught using a
giant butcher knife in a vain attempt to gain
entrance, and to get locked in the bathroom
from the outside for over 20 minutes with no
water and a case of dengue. I had to pound
and scream until some random guy passing the
house heard me and set me free.

certainly getting locked inside and outside

Don Inmus and Rutgers: Its implications for Grinnell and beyond

Last weck, I performed with Grinnell College’s Young,
Gifted and Black gospel choir at a local church, where well
over 90 percent of the congregation is white, Despite the
name of the choir, almost half of our members do not idene
tify as black or African-American. some people think the
choir's name is inappropriate or
outdated considering the evolu—
tion the choir has undergone sincc
its inception in the early 1970s.

During the lunch that followed
our church performance, I sat next
to an older whitc womrrn who was at
least in her 70sThe woman inquired
about my thoughts concerning Imus‘
remarks. At that time 1 was quite ignorant about the actual
words he used to describe the Rutgers team. One of my white
choir members kindly informed me that he called the Rutgers
women basketball team a bunch of“lmppy-hended hos."Aftcr
hearing my friend recount this phrase word for word, the older
woman at my table attempted to convince me that Imus may
have been trying to complimciit the girls.

The words of Don Imus were much more than insensitive,
theywercdegradingand dehumanizingl purposely have chosen
not to use the words sexist and racist to describe his comments,
although they definitely fall into these categories, because these
e‘ismstoo often move us awayfrom discussions ofhuinan dignity.

Her response seemed to reﬂect an ignorance ofthe meaning
and cultural implications ofImus’statements. It is much easier
for me to forgive this old woman's ignorance than the rcccnt
