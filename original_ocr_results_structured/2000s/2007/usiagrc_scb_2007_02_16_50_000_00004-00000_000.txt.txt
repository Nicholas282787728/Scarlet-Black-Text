After much planning, SOL finishes mural

Group hopes mural will educate about Latino and Latina culture, encourage dialogue on campus

By T} HAWLEV

After weeks of preprirnuon 1nd unforeseen
setbacks, the Student Oiganizaiion of Lati—
iioS/Lnlmns (SOL) inaugurated their inuial
last Friday, Feb. 9 at the SOL ofﬁce on the seen
and ﬂoor ofthc JRC.

The inuiiil, which was originallyt the idea
ofDaisy venrnrn 09 is intended to be 1 repre
sentation of Latino and Latina culture.

The go 11 was to educ1re the Grinncil com-
munity and to provoke dis
cussion about Latino and
Latina culture.

Each pait of the mural
represents 1 ditrcienr cem-
ponent of Hispanic culture
and Latin American history.

According to SOL lite
eiature, the mural includes
such iconic images as labor
leader Cesar Chavez, the
ancient city Xochirnileo and
the Lilly, representative of
Mexican painter Diego Rivera.

According to member Danny Zamora
’08, the mural is intended to “bring 1warcr
ncss about [Latinos and Latinas] and express
who we are as 1 people in Grinnell". SOL also

hopes to display the 1n1n-1l 1n the student in
gallery of the JRC next semestei once spiicc
becomes available.

The muial was chiefly the effort of SOL
membership. SOL leadership asked its mem-
bers to bring images, ideas, or items “that
meant home to them," said Melina Rivera’07 a
COTlCi’lLlCI ofthc organization,

SOL membeis Rivera, Zamora, Paula Mar
tallana ‘10, and Jasmine Sanchez ’10 compiled
the ideas, created sketch-
es, and then combined
them into n cohesive
mural.

"[The whole process]
probably tooka good two
weeks meeting several
times to talk about [the
design]," said Sanchez.

The members then
projected and traced the
design upon three wood
panels they had earlier
primed.

The mural was then set on the courty1rd
between ARH and Noyce alongside painting
supplies so that all members of the Grinnell
community could contribute to it. Participa—

tion, 1ccording to
SOL leaders, was cone
sidcriible and helped
connect the organizar
tion to the rest of the
campus community.

Due to inclem-
eiit weather, the initial
painting process took
longer than expected
since it was difﬁcult
to work outside, said
Zamora,

The project was
put on hold for much
of the second half of
last semestei.

SOL hopes to use
their leftover paint to
create a second mural
sometime in the future,

The eventual gonl is to assemble panels
done by each Grmnell multicultural group into
one giant mural to facilitate better communi—
Cnﬁon among the organizations.There are also
tentative plans for an SOL food bazaar and a
celebration for The Day of Children.

SOL hopes to use these upcoming events

to increase pnrriciparion and membership in
the organization and get more exposure for its
campus activities, For Sanchez and the others,
it is a noteworthy step for Latino culture at
Grinnell and 1 great accomplishment for SOL
in general, said Sanchez, "1 just enn't believe
we did that"

sent an email to O'Neil
with a flier attached.

In addition to ex-
plaining the website was
hacked and the hack-
ers had possible access
to passwords and user
names, the flier asked
students to consider
“How many people‘s r1-
nancial data was put in
danger by the plans ad-
ministrators’ decision to
be less than forthcoming
about the nature of the
threat?"

O‘Neil and Postman
spent much of Sunday

“He forced us to

According to O'Neil
and Sidonie Straughn»

“The obligation of
plans in this situation is
to do whatever they can
to get people to change
their passwords," he said.
“I think they grievously
failed in reviewing their
obligations and chose to
cover their own asses."

SrrnughnrMorse
thinks otherwise.
“There’s no evidence that
passwords were compror
mised," she said, “We
wanted to post accurate
information we didn’t
want to cry fire."
