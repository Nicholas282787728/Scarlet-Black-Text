The men's basketball team locked up sole
possession ofthe regular season MWC cham-
pionship with a 109-86 victory over lllinois
college last Saturday, moving its current win»
ning streak to 13 games. While the Blue Boys
kept it close in the ﬁrst halfand trailed by only
three at halftime, they were never able to pull
even with the Pioneers. Grinnell went on a 10»
0 run in the second halfand pushed the lead to
25 before shutting down the system.

Jon Grotberg '09 led the team in scoring
with 31 and Dave Arseneault ’09 put up his
eighth double-double of the season with 14
points and 11 assists.

The most notable stat of the day, however,
was senior Doug Tieus’s four steals, which
pushed his season total to 85, a new school
record

“I think the biggest reason I was able to
get so .nany steals this year is the pressure the
front or the press puts on people,"Ticus said.
“Experience also played a big factor, since my
coach in high school also focused on hill-court
pressure."

By winning their ﬁrst conference chame
pionship since 2003, Griuuell clinched home
court advantage for the MWC tournament,
which will determine the conference’s repret
sentative to the NCAA Division III national
tournament,

This afternoon at 5 pm. secondeseed Care
roll College will face number three seed Rie
pon College. Grinnell defeated Ripon in their
only matcheup this year, 120118, at Ripon.
Grinnell split with Carroll, with both teams

winning at home.

Grinnell will race off against fourth-seed
Lake Forest tonight at 7 pm. The Pioneers
suffered their last loss of the season against
Lake Forest on Jan. 6before beginning their
current winning streak. Two weeks ago, the
Pioneers avenged the loss with an impressive
100—65 victory in Darby Gym over the For-
esters—the game that saw Lake Forest coach
Chris Conger get ejected after receiving two
technical fouls.

Hosting the tournament will give Grinnell
multiple advantages in the eyes orthe Pioneer
players.

“We will be able to sleep In our own beds
and avoid a five to eight hour bus ride," said
Tieus. “Our legs and minds will be fresh all
weekend.“

Ahmad Idrissa ‘09 feels the crowd will
provide an additional advantage. “The crowd,
especially the guys courtsidc, acts like a sixth
man on the court for us and provides us with
that extm energy,”he said.

That extra energy led Grinnell to a 10-1
home record during the regular season.

In anticipation ofa large student turnout,
the college is expanding the student section
more towards the half-court line for the tour»
namenc security will allow students to stand
on the floor as long as they stay behind the
line ortape placed there, according to athletic
director Dee Falrchild.

secutivc team victories in dominant fashion, winning 25 of the

beat their opponents by a total of 24 games to five.

out Westminster College’s top player, Myles Yokeley, in straight

sets, and the Pioneers won all nine matches on the day.

Grinnell got another sweep from their top man last Saturday
when LaFountaine downed Zac Kerr to guide the Pioneers to a
hard-fought team win over Nebraska-Wesleyan, eight matches
to one. Fox and Best also cruised to victory in the numbers two
and three slots, but DJ. Warden '08 needed three close sets (4-
6, 673,105) to win the number four match-up.

tories in the number five and six slots.The doubles team ofBest
and Jordan Lee dropped the number thrcc doubles match, 5-8.

victories, LaFountaine is expecting a more challenging road
ahead.

ule this year that will challenge us, he sai 1 “We have a number
of ranked Division HI teams and a Divrsion 1 team [schcde

uled]."

a big individual challenge from the returning MWC singles
champion. The singles championship is likely to go through
St. Norbert s Aaron Sunday, who Will he looking to become the
only four-year singles champion in MWC history this season

My personal goal' is first and foremost that the team wins

only two losses last year. My goal is to win a singles conference
title and repeat as a doubles champ and a team champ,"

Finishing strong: Women’ s basketball team wins finaltwo games

av NATE LINDSEY

The womens basketball team finished
their season last week with a pair of wins to
put their ﬁnal record at 9-14 overall and 5-11
in MWC play. The ﬁnal buzzer: against Knox
College and Illinois College brought reflection
for seniors about their careers and speculation
about next season's outlook.

The Pioneers snapped a ave-game losing
streak to defeat Knox 74-62 on Valentine's
Day. The team bounced back from a rough
ﬁrst haltshooting performance to knock down
13 of26 shots In the second half, including five
of 11 three-pointers.

Hannah Wolf ’08 led the team with 33
points whilc Anna Friel '10 snagged nine rt:-
bounds.

The Pioneers then ended the season with
a 8448 victory over illinois college at Darby
last Saturday. Wolf again led the Pioneers in
points with 2; while Caitlin Shannon '07
hauled in a teamehigh seven rebounds to finish
her collegiate career, The victory also marked
the ﬁnal games for seniors Emily Kolbe and

Veronica Clark.

“It means a lot to the seniors to have some
good memories on the last day to look back
on,” Shannon said. “What came together for
the team was the fact that we started playing
for each other and nothing else."

Despite Shannon feeling frustrated with
the program doling several parts of her career,
she felt she came away with an experience that
positively affected her charactel.

“Discovering how strong of an individual
I can be and determination, peiseverance,
focus, and love of the game can trump a mule
titude orrrusrrations,” Shannon said. “Playing
four years ofbaskctball at Grinnell College has
been one ofthe hardest things I have ever done
in my life."

Shannon believed the best advice she could
give to her teammates returning for another
season was to make the team their own and
keep personal frustrations from becoming
team frustrations.

“Remind yourselfevery day ofwhy it is you
play," Shannon said. ”Appreciate at least one

good thing every diiy you get to play, and let
that help you keep things positive

Wolf, who led the team and conference in
scoring this year at 22.3 points pc‘r game, be-
lieves next year's team has the potential to be
more successful on the court.

“I think that we have a dccent chance to
Improve next season, especially if we get ev-
eryone back who isn't graduating," Wolf said.
“Losing our seniors this year will be rough,
though, as they were big contributors to our
game. They will deﬁnitely be missed."

As far as replacing the outgoing seniors,
Coach Andrew Hamilton is well on his way to
filling out the roster with two players commit-
ted and enrolling in the college next fall.

“As we look to the future, it is kind ofhard
to make a projection about how strong we will
be," he said. “I’ve been around college sports
enough to know that two things cm help im-
prove a team 7 hard work in the oiteseason by
the players and recruiting by the coaclung start.
with a couple more commitments, we should
fill the holes due to graduation."
