Kyle cr-nufrll likes ro unnder. The past six yerrs of his life hnye
rnken him ro mnny differenr plnces, from rhe army to Oklnhomn State.
from Los Angeles to rhe wilderness of New York, and from Norris
ﬁrst to Loose second.
Before Grinnell, Cmnﬁll spenr rwo yeors on neriye duty as n Com-
hnr Engineer in iire Nnrionnl Gunrd, assigned re the joh ofgllardlng
chemical weapons. “Seriously, sounds Cool ...isn’r," snicl Crunﬁll. “1
menu it wns n group of300+ guys rrnpped together for over n year on
n ernppy lirtle hnse doing the snme boring job over and overwso we
found shit to do most oi‘it drunk albeit, but we amused ourselves."
This “xlmusmicnt” on one particularly boring dry entailed srenlr
mg n whire yon nnd dressing up in nll block in order to lead n “sem'r
successful nssnulr on rhe securiry guard hendousrrers for the exterior

basaf’scild Crrlnflll. “W: all go: in a lot of trouble, but hellI rllnr's half

ofwhy we did it. \Ne were bored."

Cronfrll's expellence in the nrrny prepared him, in n sense, for life
or Grinnell.“The nrrny nus Very much so n self govermnee enricy,”snid
crrnfrll. “As long as n selgeanr dldn'r know something was going on rr
didn't marten, you took care ofsruﬂ‘intemully."

Afrer his time in rhe rrrrny, Ci‘ailﬁll srudied chemical engineering
ar Oklahoma State. Now rm Economics major at Grinnell, Crilnﬁll are
rrihnres hrs serdemie wondering ro horedorn.The summer before his
second your or Oklnhomn. crnnfrll took on economics course heennse
he had norhu-rg horror ro do. in firm class, Cmnfrll surprisingly found
the philosophy he'd been looking for. "I’ve nlwrye thoughr of things
in whar turned out to be economical terms," said Cl'ﬂl’lﬁll. “I think it
reolly was nice ro frnd somerhlng rhnr .nnde sense or a paint in my life
where I nos looking for an ideology"

wrih n new ideology, cmnml ulso hegnn looking for s new oollege.
His wnnderings led him here ro Grinnell

Cmnﬁll’s first impression of Grinnell was memorables After drops
plug off his belongings rn his room in Norris, “I wandered into rhe
lounge and I saw David Blumc ('08) passed out on the couch with his
pants undone and around his knees and his hands down his boxers
wirlr Sports cenrer on TV."

Usually when Cmnflll is monndering nround cnmpus, he enn he
sporred wirh his standnrd riCrdyed r-shirrs nnd bare feer. “Afreryou‘ye

get enuuses," snid Cianﬁll. “seinerimes 1 just can’t frnd
my shoes nnd rr’s hundy to he nhle to rrrn to class hnrefoor
and nor hove to worry nhour sropping on pinccones or
something.”

CY‘JHﬁU roamed from coast to coast in rhe summer
of 2006, when has decided to ri'nvel around the states via
Greyhound Bus nnd Amrrok. He spent rime in horh Los Angeles and

a friend. “I an n lor of‘growing in rhur rune because I had time to
