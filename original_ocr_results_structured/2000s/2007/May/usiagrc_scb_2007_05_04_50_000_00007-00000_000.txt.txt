Almost every yeai, the
559’]? runs a columnvor
an aiticle, or a letter to the
cdimI—dcclaring that self-
governance is dead. in 2005,
Brendan Mackic '07 referred
to sclﬁgovcrnnncc as a “ghost
on campus", a specter that
only reveals itself III “mail—
ings to prospective students"
and in the wistful tales of
upperclassmen. Yet on a cam-
pus where dorIn windows
are frequently broken and
loggia posrcrs Irc rorn down
every weekend, students still
defend and applaud the idea
of self governance. It’s nevel
easy to re-evaiuate a campus
institution or admit its fail-
ings, but with rhc arrival of
new campus buildings and
the removal of distribution
requirements. perhaps sells
governance should also be up
for review.

Grinnell ofﬁcially in-
stituted its unique brand of
self-governance in the 1970s,
when dorms rapidly changcd
from separare singlcsset sides
of campus to coed ﬂoors.
Caught up in the antivau-
thoritarian spirit of the age
and protesting the strict lIIni-
rations on malt/female visita-
tion rights, students called for

Istration

students mutter about it. Ac-
cording to SGA President
Chris Hall '07, howcvcr, self-
govcmancc is alive and well,
evident in the“subtlc nuances"
of campus life “SclrsgoveI-s
nancc is srill very much In cfr
fcct,"said Hall. “If someone Is
brcakingabottleon Cleveland
beach, for example, someone
wIll piobably say, Hey, that's
not the Iight thing ro do.”
Lousehead RLC Kim
Hinds-Brush agrccd with
Hall, adding that while sélfe
governance exists, it could
“probably ﬂinction better."
According to HIndssBrush,
“The most Important thing
is students being willing to
talk to people on rhcir ﬂoors,
and IrSAs nrc willing to do it,
rhcn pcoplc at large arc more
willing ro do it themselves,"
For this reason, Grinnell
student staff is expected to
play an essential role in up—
holding the ideal of self-
governance. Unlike colleges
whcrc paid rcsIdcncc advisers
are required to report student
delinquency, student ndvisors
at Grinnell are unpaid so they
can be nonsmnndatory report~
ers. Instead of functioning as
I kind of police force for thc
residence halls, student ZldVl’
sets are generally expected to

w o u"l d
treat them
as adults.

Despite the apparent faith
in sclisgovcrnrncc, however,
hall ﬁnes and campus vandal—
ism still occurs on a regular
basis. Younker Hall alone has
sustained thousands ofdollars
in hall lines this semester. and
students regularly complain
that nonsYounker residents
use the dorm to hold destrucs
tiwc parties. “People not own-
ing up to things is a maon
problem," said Hoffman".
“ButI also think that the ﬂoor
fines system is very unfair."

Duc ro their pcrceivcd
lack of transparency, ﬂoor
fines at Grinncil are a contens
tious issue. Floors are often
fined more money tor clean-
up than they expect, and
many ﬁnes are not even pro
