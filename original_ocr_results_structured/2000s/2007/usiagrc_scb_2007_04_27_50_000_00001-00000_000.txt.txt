SAs work to ensure
support for students

By REBECCA PARK

Last weelt, ClangIala staffl'leard 11un1or th1t when a student, upset about the death ofPaul
Shuman-Moorc '09, asked for an extension on a presentation, the professor refused the request
and failed the student. Though the tumor was actually false, Clangi'ala staffbegan Work to make
sure the situ111on would not happen.

At a s11ff meeting last Thursday night, Clangrala student Advisors discussed how p1ofessors
were handling the complicated reactions re the events ofrhe weck. The studentwlio was deiued
111 extension was a prominent topic. “We started talking about each ofour individual prorcssors'
responses to whats been going on on campus, s1id Bnanne Benness 03,1 member ofthe Clan-
grala student staff. “We found th1t all otus had very different expenences. After the meeting,
some student st1ff members decided to draft a letter to address concerns that professors were not
meeting academic needs in the situation.

According ro Benness, they sent the letter to all student staff members outside the Clangrala
cluster, encouraging them to forward it to their floor community, faculty and deans. Friday cvc-
ning, college administrators held a meeting with student s11ff members, Present 11 the meeting
were Jirn Swarrz, Dean of the College, Jeyee stern, Dean of Student Academic support and
Advising, Eliza Willis, Political Science Chair of the Faculty, and Jon Chcnette, Associate Dean
of the College

At the meeting, student staff members expressed their concerns over academically stressed
students to college administrators. “I think we had 1 re1lly positwe response from the people we
talked to," said Benness, "The biggest thing it earne down to w1s that faculty are ac1ing on their
own and faculty are just as uncomfortable as we are in bringing 1111 the situation.”

Over the weekend, Chenette wrote an email to faculty, presenting strident concerns. Stein
explained that Academic Afrairs was responding to the minority ofcascs where student needs
were not adequately met, and that these ongoing discussions were not intended as a definitive
solution. “My sense is that 99 percent ofthe t1eulty responded very compassion11ely," she said.
“And there may have been some isolated incidenrs with students feeling as though thelt current
situation wasn’t dealt with in a productive way." In such instances, Stern encouraged individuals
to come to Student Affairs to seek assistance.

The strident staff hoped to encourage professors to communicate more directly with

STIFund: New possibilities to initiatives

STIFund Committee starts meeting and will address what isses to support with the $10,000 fund

13v PATRICK CALDWELL

Student initiatives have long been a mech-
anism ofcxpressing student opinion. Past inl»
tiatives have endorsed 1 range ofissues from 1
Middle East Studies concentration to 1 Bean
bag Chair room. Over the ye1rs, few of these
initiatives were implemented, instead serving
as symbols ofstudents’ frustrations. But many
students are now hopeful thar their proposals
may become reality, thanks to the newly chr
ated STIFund.

Earlier this semester at his State of the
College address, SGA President Chris Hall
07 introduced the STIFund, a special SGA
fund intcnded to help implement successful
initiatives Two weeks ago, the S FIFund com

mittee, which is responsible for the managing
of the fund. had its first meeting and discussed
how to use the money,

The 13rmember
committee, which con,
sists of SGA Cabinet
members, senators, and
students at large (which
include 5553 editorrinr
chief Cnirlin Carmody
’08) while only having
met twice so far, is al—
ready deciding on initia-
tives to fund before the end otthis ye1r

For the first ycm' of operation, STIFund
is working with 11 somewhat smaller budget

”Should we be paying our
money for something that the
school should be paying for?”

than it will in the future. This year's budget
is coming out of the ﬂuid balance. or ‘slush
fund,’ which contains past years' SGA buds
get surpluses. In the future, the
STIFund will become it 1cgul1r
part of the SGA budget. “We
have 810,000 for this first se-
mcster since it wasn’t budgeted
in [originally],"sa'id Hall.“l\'ext
semester we’ll have more."
While next y:' 3- budget has
not been decided, SGA TICSUI'
er and chair of STIFund corn-
1nittee B11d Bishop '08 said they hoped to set
aside $25,000 for STIFund in future SCIHC’ST
(CL. With the cieation of STIFund, Hall said

Chris Hall
SGA President

the goal is to "make sure no money is added to
the slush fund balance."

The committee has started to narrow a
list of initiatives to potentially fund for this
year. The list covers a range ofissues such as
increasing pienie tables on campus, opening
Quad for student usage, ereating 1n Atriearn
Studies concentration and a school swing set,
among others.

Acetnding 1o Bishop, in deciding
in ives to fund first, “the list ofpossib
. weighted toward more recent initiatives.”
While Bishop said the committee is hoping
to fund recent initiatives first, every initiative
