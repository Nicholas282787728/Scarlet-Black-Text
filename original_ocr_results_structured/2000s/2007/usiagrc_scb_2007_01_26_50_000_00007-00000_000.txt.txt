BY Nit-rt; LINDSEY

The women’s basketball team continued
a roller coaster season over winter break by
winning just one of their sbt games, coming
away with a big win against Lawrence Uhir
versity but dropping close contests against
Beloit and Ripon, A bright spot came for the
Pioneers when Hannah Wolf '08 became the
fifth Pioneer woman basketball player in his
tory to reach the 1,000 career point mark, and
Grinncll got back on track Tuesday with a win
over Knox College,

The Pioneers went into the game on Jan.
12 looking for an apset over MWCrleading
Lawrence. With 21 seconds left and the score
knotted at 5565, Hannah Wolf’OS took a pass
from Miki Nakamura ’10 and nailed a shot to
give the Pioneers the win. Wolf ﬁnished with
21 points and eight rebounds, and Emily Kolbe
’07 chipped in 10 points and six boards.

Following the Lawrence win, the Pio-
neers dropped a tough game to Beloit that
was decided in the final second. A loose ball
foul called on Caitlin Shannon '07 with just
two-tenths of a second left in the game put

Buccaneers playei Katie McCool on the line
with the game tied, where she knocked down
the winning free throw to give Beloit a 57-56
victory.

The Pioneers lost their next thrce games,
including the match against Ripon during
which Wolf poured in 42 points to pass the
1000 point mark. Wolf was happy with the
achievement but expects new challenges to
arise as teams look for ways to defend her.

“They’ll be pressure for me to continue
scoring as well as extra defensive pressure from
other teams in the conference," she said,

Coach Andy Hamilton has been impressed
with Wolf's ability to spread the ball and set
up chances for her teammates in addition to
hot scoring. As for her 1,000 point milestone,
Hamilton cited a more well-rounded offensive
game as Wolf’s biggest improvement.

"Hannah’s hard work in offrseason strength
and conditioning made her not only a great
shooter, but a great scorer as well,which is what
our program needed," he said. “I'm excited to
see how the rest ofher career pans out."

After the game, Wolf was presented with

a basketball Signed by her teammates and
coaches.

“I guess it means that I've done what I'm
supposed to do here, which is to score," Wolf
Sﬂldt

Wolf continued her frenetic scoring pace
against Knox on Tuesday, pouring in 28 points
as the Pioneers earned a 8976 Victory. Grinnell
led by as many as 24 points late in the second
half, but a fullrcourt trap by Knox closed. the
grip during the final moments.

Katie Schumacher’07 added 18 points and
seven assists, and Anna Friel ’10 recorded a
doublerdouble with ten points and ten boards.

“We had some people that were really on
last night that hadn't been on in a while or
hadn't gotten shots in a while," Wolf said, “It
was really nice to see Katie [Schumaeher] get
the opportunity to knock down some threes,"

The win moved Grinnell to 7,9 overall (3,
6 MWC).The Pioneers travel to IllinOis Cole
loge (3,13) 1r8 MWC) tomorrow afternoon
before heading to Monmouth College on
