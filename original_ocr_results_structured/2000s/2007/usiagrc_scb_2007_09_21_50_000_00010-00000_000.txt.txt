Students worry that Quad will remain locked and quiet

nanFr RADERSTRONG

For over a century, students living on south
Campus walked south through the loggia two
to three times a day to eat their meals in Quad
dining hall. But now, two years after dining
has moved to the Joe Rosenfleld Y25 Center,
many ﬁrsk and secondryears may not recog-
nize the stained glass windows, high ceilings
and old wooden tables that made glad the
next best thing to Hogwarts.

By centralizing campus, rthRc has elimir
tinted some of the NorthrSouth divide, but in
the process has made (luad obsolete. While
the old Cowles dining hall was quickly reno-
vated into apartments, students do not want
the same changes to be made to Qiad's unique
architecture and atmosphere. Although the
space has recently begun to be used for spe
cial events, many students see {ﬂuid as being
wasted, sitting empty with the doors locked to
most students.

Since it stopped functioning as a dine
ing hall, around 20 events have been held in
it. These have ranged from private wedding
receptions over breaks to student-run events
like a Free The Planet burrito dinner and the
Gtinnell College Christian Fellowship’s Hunt
get Banquet,

Right now, however, it does not seem like
Quads usage will move beyond these periodic
special events.

“Are there things that could be done to
make it a more usable space?" said Rachel Bly
’93, director of Conference Operations. “Sure.
But I don’t think they are on the top of any—
one's priorities list.”

When Quad first closed, the administra-
tion waited to decide what to do with it. “The
message we got from the administration last
year,” said Jan Koszewski ’08, vice president
ofStudent Affairs, “is that we would let it sit.
And this year we'd actually move forward with
using it."

Last year, a strident initiative passed, call-

ing for Chlad to be used as a study space. “We
decided we need to open [glad] up in some
way,"said Whitney Knopf '09,one orthc write
ers of the lmlmIlVCt “Why not turn it into a
study space>"

Knopf said that making it into a study
space would be the easiest thing to do, as rherc
are already tables and chairs inside. After the
initiative passed, little was done to fulﬁll its
stipulations. Currently, anyonc can reserve
Qiad for a special event, as long as the event’s
needs are ﬁllﬁlled by the (and space. How-
ever, if there is no event inside, the doors re-
main locked.

Both Koszewski and Knoptwant to see it
used more, even irthat simply means holding
more events in it, However, Josh Weber ’08,
who ate at Quad as a ﬁrsrryear, thinks that it
should sometimes be used for special meals.
“I’d like to eat there at least once and a while,”
he said.

The logistics for holding allrcampus meals
in Qlad as well as orherallrcampus events will
be hard to arrange. SGA is planning on us-
ing the space by showing a Harry Potter movie
soon and also putting on a concert. But be-
cause there is no AV system and the tables and
chairs are heavy and hard to move, using Quad
as a multipurpose room {or more events like
these will be difficult. And if (Liad is opened
as a study space, it will virtually rule out sched—
uling more events or meals in it,

However, that does not mean Quad will
remain locked. “I think almost anything is rea—
sible," said Bly. “Nobody wants to see it there
sitting doing nothing. "

What accomplishments of Free the Children are you
most proud of?

It depends on what you think will bring about the greatest
social change in the end, because the easiest answer to your
question would be to say 250 schools. It’s easy to print, it’s
something people understand. But I think the greatest accom-
plishment or Free the Children is something that goes much
broader than than it's creating a movement that is entirely led
by students and young people, on a global level, showing that
it is possible.

Willi that youth we’ve been able to create partnerships with

in bringing schools and supplies, ﬁghting this, you’d have a hUr
manitarian disaster in this region.

Do you ever run into any [cultural] problems when work-
ing in these countries?

One of our requirements is that 50 percent of students at-
tending out schools are girls. So in order to establish that, it
takes a lot ofwork in the local community,

When we do development projects, we have a philosor
phy called ‘Drink Tea.’We literally sit for six months before a
brick is laid. In the case of Sri Lanka for example, a tradition-
ally Muslim community, historically the girls there didn't go to
secondary school, so we sat down with the community leaders,
and we sat down with the fathers and mothers, and we had
discussions to learn what could we do to support girls going
to school. And what we could do to make sure the community

 

Oprah Winfrey’s Angel Network, or the United .
Nations, or institutions around the world, to create
a cultural shitt among young people, try to raise
an army, literally a generation ofyouth that are so~
cially conscious, who are going to vote with a con-
scious, who are going to shop as consumers looking
at organic and fair trade, who are going to raise
their voices politically, who will volunteer, who will
choose different careers and give back.

Where do you see the most problems with
child labor issues?

 

would support it. So talking with all the people,
and ofcourse the girls themselves,\ve found that
in the end, they uceded us to design the school
differently.

Do you agree with the stereotype of the
current young generation being apathetic?
Do I think that the generation is apathetic? No.
‘ But do I think that we’re as active as we should
be? Absolutely nott think that we leave places
of higher learning today with the idea that ml,

 

 

Each continent still has its pockets. For exam-
ple, Asia has made amazing strides in the fight against poverty,
but when you look are rural communities in parts of south
crn India, for example, the boom ofMumbai or Bangalore has
passed those regions. When we work there, its children making
ﬁreworks, children who sit everyday loading ﬂammable chemi-
cals into tiny tubes and all it takes is a single spark and the
entire place is up in ﬂames.

Even when you look in China. We see China, we see thc
Olympics. But where we work we see a per capita income that
works out to 30 cents a day, a third below the UN's deﬁnition
orabsolute poverty. Ifit wasn't for food aid, for groups coming

lege is about getting ajob, and the point oftliat
job is to earn money.

I think that colleges and universities have to shift and be
far more critical in the role they are in, they're not just places
to prepare a study to go get a job, and they have to challenge
students, like bring in a mandatory community service require
ment for graduation. Look at forgiveness in debts to service,
pausing studentloans ifthey’ll serve. Look at a campus becom»
ing free trade. This has to come at the highest levels of the
administration, and it also has to come from the students ask
ing for it. Do I think they’re apathetic? No. but also think that
there's a lot more youth can and must do.
