Tornado spares campus, but
leaves students confused

BYJULl/l BOTTLES SLMATT ZMUDKA

Grinnell narrowly avoided a reenactment of its devastat—
ing 1882 cyclone encounter on Sunday, Sept. 30. When severe
storms threatened campus early in the evening. many students
were left confused, worried and stuck in random basements
across campus as a tornado warning was issued for most of
Poweshiek County. The tornado came as close as five lniles
from campus, causing damage rn the nearby town otMalcorn
but leaving Grinnell untouched as students took shelter for
over an hour.

The first sign nftrouble came just before 7 p. in. last Sun-
day evening when supervisor Lyle Baurnan
instructed everyone in the dining hall to
leave their trays on the tables and head to the
basement ofthe JRC. “ Some ofthcln have no
idea what a tornado is or what it can do, and
you know what, we have lots ofglass in this
building," Baumall said. “lfsomething would
happen to even onc [student] where l was on
dirty in a case like that, I would just be sick."
As students made themsc 'cs comfortable in
the JRC basement, confusion about the alert system left stue
dents clsewhcl‘c on campus confused about how to react.

While drnncr patrons were trapped ln thc whitewashed halls
of the jRC basement, four students in Lazier found thcmsclvcs
trapped in an elevator for 30 minutes. “Our first reaction was
kind of, ‘that sllcks.'\’l’c weren't scared. it was more like, lel's try
and get out of here," Mark Rosenberg '11 said. “So we called
security, they told us to hold on, which was horribly ironic be—
cause we had no choice."

Mark Godm', director of Facilities Management (FM). ex-
plained that the problem was the result ofpower interruptions
that occurred when the elevator was sensing its location. “With
the power down, even for a second, at that precise moment,

’lfiomelh/‘ng WOU/d happen in
even one [student] where / war
on duty. I would just be st tk.“

it creates an error condition and the. elevator shuts down," he
said

The foursome tned ringing call buttons, signaling SOS us:
ing the alarm bell and pressing ﬂoor butrons, to no avail. ““76
all kind of realized they would come and get us so it was use-
less," Mali McCullough '11 said. A little over a halfehour after
they entered the elevatOi, continuous restarting of the elevator
system in Lazicr basement set them free.

When the tornado warning was finally called off around
8 pm. many students trapped in the JRC basement found
then elves back in the dining hall. “We opened back up for
20 minutes so that we could be sure to meet
the needs of all the diners," Baum-an said,
adding that students, both employees and
uollrelnployees, helped clean the dining hall
afterward.

Amid all ofthc confusion on campus (lur’
ing rhc warning, Dilecmr of security Steve
Eriscoe felt that his department perrorrned
successfully. Currently, Security relies upon
an an l and rorce message system to alert
students. “There’ ornc things I would like to see done better,"
Br iscoe said, "[lurr] l thitlk we did a good job with what we had,
the e mail Sl stem. While student complaints about confu ion
caused by Seeunty e rnails were widespread Briscoe rn »
that the Sc lrity Office did all it could to ll'lim’ll'l student

Security also exploring options to add a text messaging
program to improve the alert system, while acknowledging that
a perfect system may not be possible,

“If we get all three or all four of those things in place,l
feel that we‘ll have a system that will be capable ofgetting the
message our to most people on caraprrs,”l3riscoe said. “Can we
develop a system where every-body's going to get the message?
I don't know ifwe can,"

It was Rachel's first night back ln Grlnncll, the first night
of New Student Orientation weekend untl Rachel, a senior,
showed up ro the High Street parry around 10:30 p.m. She
knew who owned the house, the rooms were full ofold friends
and when the keg ran out ofhect, everyone in the kitcheni
people Rachel didn’t recognize and doesn’t remembetiall
pollted parts oftheir drinks into a cup so she could have some,
too. Caught up in conversation, Rachel didn’t watch liei drink
closely and put it down a couple times on a table ncar the door
Thirty minutes later, still only half way through her ﬁrst drink,
Rachel started feeling woozy and strange. Her boyfriend found
her wandering outside on the front lawn and walked hm home.
She couldn’t walk straight. She wasn't speaking coherently. At
the paity of friends and students, someone had slipped her a
date rape drug

In 2007, three students lravc reported experiences that
strongly point to the use ofdate rape drugs. For everyone in
volvcd, predatory drugs appearing on campus rs as confusing as
it is alarmingithere are no clear motives and no clear suspects.
Fortunately, all the victims who have reported their experiences
wcrc surrounded by close tricnds In familiar environments and
all returned home safely. Still, ruinots abound about who could
be behind the druggings, which occurred at the orientation
week High Street parcy, the Pub and a dance party in Gardner.
The drugs could be the work otoae person or many, a student
or someone from town, and it is not yet clear itthere are other
victims. Whatever the case, Grinncll’s tight, trusting campus
community has, for some students, proven to be potentially
more dangerous than anyone wants to believe.

The Grinnell women slipped date rape drugs often aren't
sure how to react. All of the reported victims got home safely,
after all. But weeks after the incidents. the psychological effect
ofbeing slipped a date rape drug is still taking its toll.

“I have foggy memories ofthe night, they're like snapshots,"
said Rachel.When she woke up confused and disoriented, Ra—
chel didn’t know what to believe had happened the night be-
fore, but she deﬁnitely didn’twant to think her strange behavior
was the result ofRohyphol, GHB or Ketamine. the three main
date rape drugs. She decided not to test herselfwith one ofthe

Trustees visit

lw Clilus'rlul: STODDARD 8c Clllus NEUBERT

After much anticipation, the trustees arrived in Grinncll
yesterday to once again consult and deliberate on the fate of
the campus. At last night's trustee open forum, students had
a chance to voice their concerns to trustees and question them
about the direction otthe college. issues addressed ranged from
supporting the new climate commitment, to inibiming the
trustees about ambition student plans such as Rchw Orleans,
and the Social Entrepreneurs of Grinnell.

For some trustees, the open forum offered the first chance
to interact with students in their new iole. Trustee Paul Risser
'61, said he was excited about the opportunity to meet with
students, and offered a vision for the Board ofTrustccs that
would keep“ a good balance between leadership excrcised bv the
President and the Trust

ansrees should of r ideas about the general direcrion oi
the college's resources," he said, bllt added that students and
the administration should take the lead. Rissei- said that there
are three key issues the college should address, creating a more
“intcinational campus“, increasing the use of teclinologl’r and
promoting education .tl diversity.

Trustee locl Spiegel ’78 ameed with Risset, and added the
board's fundamental respousi 'Ity is to sound governance and
fiscal responsibility Spicgel said that the college must also to-
cus on making Grinnell affordable and accessible.

“We are a top tier institution,” he said, “and we have the
ability to bc'morc and do more.“
