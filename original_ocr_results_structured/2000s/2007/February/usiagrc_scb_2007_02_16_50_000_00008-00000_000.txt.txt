The Notebook (2004)
iii 32m?

Cuddle up to someone for this '
sappy, sugarcoated romance

Okay, i admit that Nick Cassavctcs' T/e Nu/ebuolr
is even more predictable than Strata an it P/nue, All
right, it’s sappier than your riin-of—thcm‘iill Betty
Crocker fair. And yes, it's chock full ofsrock characters
and no one,iestassured,is going to mistake it for high
art. But ifyou're up for an oldrfishioned tearjearkcri
who cares? This is a movie you watch on a date, and
it doesn’t make the mistake of trying to be anything
more. So when, one summer, poor, sensitive country
boy Noah (Ryan Goslrng, who is nominated for an
Oscar for HAyNzlrmi) sweeps rrch, attractive Allie
(Rachel McAdams) off her feet with pancakes and
poetry, we basically know where this train is headed,
and can probably guess all the stops summer comes
to an end and Allies bitch- --on -wheels mother (Joan
Allen) hides Noah’s letters and forces the couple’s
separation. Years later, engaged to successrul nice guy
Lon (James Matsden), Allie, by chance, spots Noah
in the paper and goes to see him. Obvious problems
ensue.

Theres nothing new in this film, but thats not
important. What The Natalya/.- manages to do, thanks
in large part to Gosling's frnely calibrated perforr
mance, is to get you rooting for the characters. You
understand that no one comes out unscathed, and
that Noah and Allie’s respective lovers have to pay the
price, but who are you to stand in the way oftrue love>
This sugarcoated fairy tale is a guilty pleasureiwhy
not indulge?

Director Cassavetcs doesn't take any chances with
this film, and it’s pretty heavy with birds, sunsets and
a weepy dramatic scoie. Stalwarts James Garner and
Gena Rowlands, as a much older Noah and Allie,
frame the storyand provide narration.VVatch for sam
Shepard in in unusual amiable turn as Noah's loving
father.

The li attle scenes are deftly directed, at times
matching the quality of the Battle of Normandy
scene in Slit/mg Private Kymz.Thc ruovic is it its best,
however, when it focuses on the soldiers' rcturn home
after the photograph becomes famous, when they are
invited on 1| publicity tour to raise money for the WM
effort.

The three soldiers cope with their return in differ»
ent manners. Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford) enjoys
the hero's welcome, while john “Doc” Bradley (Ryan
Phillippe) struggles to deal with his inability to save
his friends during the battle, But it is Adam Beach's
portrayal of Ira l—layes which stands out in the en.
semble cast. When he returns home for the publicity
tour, Hayes struggles with being called a hero for the
photograph while his unit is still fighting abroad, and
deals with his problems by drinking. Beach’s strong
performance makes the movie not simply a war story,
but a human story ofsoldiets dealing with the experi-
ence of war,

The movie is not without ﬂawerhile it is strong
when in the World War 11 time period, it becomes
boggedrdown and tedious when it moves to the pres»
ent day. Luckily, these parts only constitute a small
portion of the frlm.

Flag: ofoar Fatbti‘l has not received as much attent
tion, especially with regards to award nominations, as
Clint Eastwood’s other mov1e released last year, Leis
[err/ram Inm/i‘mri, the story of that same mythic hats
tlc seen through the eyes ofthe Japanese. But while
the latter has most of the accolades, FMIm-r showcases
strong directing and expert acting that should not be
forgotten.

feeling physically and emotionally separated from the

i‘rb Aparzmmr As Xavier involves himself m incan-
ingless one-night stands and is forced to write soap
operas to support his livelihood, the film teeters hack

old friends intersect with Xavicr’s,as when he falls in
love with a former friend and travels to St. Peteisbuig
to witness the marnagc of another:

The Rim/mi Daily is a mediocre but interesting
romantic comedy. lts ending is a little too near and
tidy in comparison to its generally pessimrstrc and
meandering style. 1 recommend that anyone inter-
cstcd in watching T/M Rmriml Dal/r see 7711 Sprint's/1

insights into love and life seem incomplete, and the
two movies complement and interact with each other

visual pastiche th. s sometimes scntrmental but cclr
ebrales ‘tl kaleidosc pic look at how various med 1a and
