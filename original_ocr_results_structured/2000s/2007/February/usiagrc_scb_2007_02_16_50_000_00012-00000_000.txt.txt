Women given 15 min.

A headline in the Feb.18,1966issuc ofthc
SGB announced, “Senate DISDHSSCS Women's
Lute Penalties." That would be late penalties
for being outside of her dormirory after the
lockdown hour. The system at rhar time penal-
izcd fcrnalc students every time rhoy railcd to
make it back before the
key was tumcd. In this
new policy, proposed by
the powcrtul anti myy
tcrieus AWS bound,
:1 ridci was attached
granting cach and cv-
cry woman is "grace

used up these minutes, “A woman must serve
the normal one night of hull conﬁnement for
every ﬁVC lute minutes."

Nor everyone was pleased with thc Board's
allowance of a graco period though In an
unattlibuted editorial in the same issue, the
editor suggested: “While evciyone else who

5&3: Newsweek knack-off

I am sick of the damn "arbitrary analysis." It’s
notjust a pistentious, cheap knoekroffethvwr-
ton/é, it‘s an unfunny knockoff, The selfnimn
porranr, pseudo-tilsaﬂ’ectien present every week
is instilling the intelligence of any Grinnrllian
who feels compelled to devour the 351? every
week. We can't even get sudoku cvctywcck, but
every damn edition of the contains garbage like
“Shooting people with pellet guns. THUMBS
DOWN." No kidding?

KDIC music in the Grille

I spend a lot of time in the new grill’é, which
I like to call the {hum-um. It's a nice social place
to pretend you'rc doing work. But what bugs
me about it isn't the 55 Naked Juice or the cold
air whenever someone uses the sine»wai7e doors,
it's the endless repetition of music. Hearing the
some songs over and over, night after night, isjust
not my cup of tea, and I think regular patrons
agree wirh me.

It wouldn’t hug tne so much if there were
not such an easy solution. I don't expect the
Spencer Grill employees to roduce a new mix
every night, but rhorc arc 5N cnts who have volv
untecrcd to do so. Little known fact: we have
a campus radio station on 88.5 FM, KDIC. So
let’s tune in to our classmates instead of leaving
the CD player on repeat.

Greasers, preps, and chains

Chains is possibly the greatest vehicle {or bring
lug high school feelings to a college campuc
of two scenarios occurs: 1) you get the e-m.
pretend to not care. “Are you going to chains
1 don't know,l might," you say casually to a trionri.
Secretly, orcuursc, you rccl likc such hot propcrry
you may just ‘go hook up with thc guy down the
hall that youjust noticed. If, on the other hand, you
are not chaincd, you casually pretend you dont to
ally care cithcr. “Have you been chained?" “I havcn't
really checked my email," you reply, looking at a
monitor to make sure you’ve logged out ofOutlook
and Gmoil, just in cast: SGA got confused on your
address. "Not really my thing," you say. Well, we all
know that means some Dashboard Confessional
and black cyclincr. Mryhc I’ll see you smoking bc‘
hind the gym while those Chains poset's are at the
pcp tally.
