In addition to its size
and teaching philosophy, the
college often must reassure
prospective candidates about
its location in a small Midr
western town, “The location
is our biggest challenge," said
Brown.

rounding area.

“When [they] become
vexed about diversity issues,
they become very sensitive
to it [in the hiring process],"
said Brown, “People pause
and they need to be reassured,
they need to be comfortable
with that."

To alleviate these fears,
the college makes a concerted
effort to connect prospective
professors and their tannilics
with local realtots and public
school teachers,

“We will behaving a party
at which we will be bringing
numerous children ages two
to eight and talking about play

candidates visit, the school
emphasizes the intimacy of
both the institution and the
town. “We try to sell a sense

speech was looking at the big picture. asking. “How do we take
what we do well... and apply this toward continuing to increase
our capacity to advocate for student interests?" Hall's offered
STIFund as a possible answer.

Before his speech, Hall said that SGA wants to focus on
making initiatives eﬂ’cctive because “student initiatives are the
most grassroots form of political advocacy available" to students
on campus. He hopes that the STIFund will provide the moti—
imt'ron needed for students to take an active role in the direction
ofthe campus, as well as to give that motivation needed support
when students approach the administration.

According to Hall, it is the dirrerence between going to the
administration “with an open hand" versus showing the ad
ministration that SGA is “willing to contribute to the student
initiatives."

Generally Joint Board members and the audience responds
ed positively, and Hall received a standing ovation at the cons
clusion of his speech. Amanda Slams '07 said the resolution
was “a really good idea that could get people to stay involved
with SGA.”

Loosehcad Senator Suzanne Polivy '08 echoed this senti-
nicnt, “It's a useful and practical plan," she said. “[lr] will put
a little more power behind Joint Board... the administration
centers around money more than most students would think "

Students attending the address raised concerns over how
the new committee would operate and remain accountable to
the students. Hall and Brad Bishop '08, SGA Treasurer, both
pointed to the text of the resolution in addressing these con-
cerns, saying that the voters degree of preference, feasrb ty
and potential impact of any initiativc will drive the prioritizas
tion process. Since the committee will be made up of SGA
cabinet members, Joint Board Senators and students at large,
Hall hopes that the group Will be able to “turn the slush fund
into something more accountable and transparent.”

Clangrala Senator Junayd Mahmood '09, however, is cons
cerned that the resolution will lend the administration to “shift
the burden"ofenacting initiatives onto SGA. Mahmood hopes
to alter the resolution to include protections against the ad»
ministration “using SGA funds as a much," but is generally
optimistic about the proposal.

With student initiatives due on Monday, Hall hopes that
SGA will work to enact the initiatives as soon as possible, Joint
Board will consider the resolution again next week,

less tune to convrncc students to Vote, Despite the special nan
turc of this electron and the short period of time between the
proposal of the initiative and the student vote, both Edvmrds
and Blencowe agreed that the process went “very smoothly.”

Blcncowe and Edwards disagree, however, over whether or
not students will be more inclined to invoke the emergency
student initiative clause in the SGA Constitution in the future.
While Blencowe feels that students will be "more inclined to
have emergency initiatives," Edwards worries that too many
initiatives would decrease voter turnout and would strongly
discourage students from pursuing emergency initiatives in the
future.

As for the future of the resolution, Schicrcnbeck and the
Dems will soon be coordinating with campus groups around
Iowa to present the results to the congressional delegation.
Schierenbeek also hopes that Jornt Board will reconsider the
resolution, but adds that with the strident approval of the initia-
tivc, SGA action is no longer necessary And the Dcrns will not
allow themselves to become idle after this success Schicrcnbcck
said that. while the Dcms will probably “lay low for a while i . it
