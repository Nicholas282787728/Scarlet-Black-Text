On the weekend of Grinnell’s Halloween
party, the men's and the women's soccer reams
ended their season with eerily similar losses.
Both teams fell to Carroll, also nicknamed
the Pioneers, in the semiﬁnals of the Midwest
Conference tournament on Saturday. The
only difference was the scores, with the men
losing 170 and the women losing 21.

On the men's side, the battle of Pioneers
quickly became a test or each team's dcfcnsc.
Grinnell's broke down just before halftime,
when Carroll‘s Craig Carlson fired a shot past
goalkeeper 5am Lancaster ‘08.

“Their goal capitalized on one or the very
few mistakes [the defense] made back there,"
said Andrew Walsh ’09.

The goal ended the momentum Grinnell
had established in the first half, Grinnell led
Carroll in shots on target 5-2, and the team
was surprised that they weren‘t leading after 45
minutes.

“We controlled most of the play [in the
first half]," said Walsh. “So to gilIe up a goal
so close to halftime was very tough as well as
unlucky"

Satisﬁed with their goal, Carroll settled
into defensive mode for the second half, allow-
ing Grinnell to attack and control possession.
But Carroll's increased presence in the back
prevented the tying goal, sending Grinnell
home with a semiﬁnal defeat for the second
consecutive year.

But Grinnell has reason to be optimistic for

next season. The team returns eight starters
from Saturday’s game, losing Sam Lancaster
'08,Milan Popovic ’08 and Calvin Dane '08.

The women’s game was a story of two
halves. Carroll came out ﬂying early, as Hills
ary Reichardt put in the ﬁrst goal in the 11th
minute, while Cody Callender added a second
four minutes before the first half ended.

With its season on the line, Grinnell te-
sponded quickly in the second half. Katherine
Ni '09 scored her sixth goal of the year 15
minutes in, and the team felt sure they could
tie the score. But Grinnell couldn’t find the net
a second time, forcing Carroll keeper Sarah
McLaughlin to make ﬁve saves in the second
half.

“We definitely pressed them,"said assistant

coach Liz Carrier '07. “We were ultimately
happy with the way the second half went."

Carrier stressed that even though Grinnell
fell behind quickly in the ﬁrst half, it took until
the halftime locker room chat to really make
signiﬁcant changes. “You're yelling things
from the sidelines," she said,“but it’s a lot easir
er when everyone's in the room together."

In addition, Grinnell had to deal with Car
roll’s home field, meaning that the game was
played on field turr", not grass, and on a ﬁeld
shorter than Grinnell's. This catered to Car»
roll's strength, speed, and might have played
a factor in Carrolljumping out to a two-goal
lead.

of graduating seniors. The team only loses
two starters, Hannah Sayle '08 and Soﬁa Sk-
raba ’08, leaving weakness at the midfield
but nowhere else, and putting the Pioneers,
Grinnell not Carroll, in prime position for a
return to the top of the conference.
