The theater crowd “really lived in each
others laps," according to George Drake so,
Professor Emeritus of History and funnel
President of tho college. And Students living
in cowles ”welt considered more indepcrr
dent” because of the numerous singles in the
dorm, he said. These are the kinds of julcy
oldcsehool Grinnell tidbits Drake recounts to
Brendan Maekie ’07 and the several listeners
in Radioland on each edition of their weekly
KDIC iadio show.

The show,cal.led“Senior Momeiits,"allows
tlic two to reﬂect on the themes and moments
otGrinncll past and present. “How did we get
here and how we have change "Drake asked,
only somewhat rhetoiieally, m pleased to

Maekie sees it a hir ditrcrcnrlv I tccl that

after being approached by Wainright, agreed
to do the show.

Some ofthe topics that Drake and Mackie
have discussed over the last few months iii-
clude josiah B. Grinnell and John Brown, the
development of the dorm system, the 1882
tornado, and changes in social life. Diakc note
ed that rhe now-beloved loggias were origi:
nally built to separate the sexes: to keep South
Campus women in and men out.The doors to
South's exterior loggia were locked at curfew.
“It was very sexist,” he said. “They controlled
the men by controlling the wotnen.

Drake also likes to share the spotlight.
