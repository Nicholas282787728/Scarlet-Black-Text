Superbad
(2 007)

Chicka, Chicka, yeah!
Apatow comedy so good
it starts dialogue

Mark: 50 what is it about Judd ApntOW
that makes me think that he shadowed me
throughout high school?

Between Freak; {1nd Gee/o and Aparow‘s
latest, the utterly fantastic Superiud, I’m con-
vinced that he won’t allow these memories to
leave me.

Pat: Yeah, I feel the same way. I’m afraid
that in two years, I’m going to knock up a hot
E! News anchor' in a one night stand.

Mark: But at least we’ll get to go to Cirque
Du Soleil on shrooms.

Pat: But we shouldn't get ahead of our—
selves.

Espeeially because our personalities are
eerily similar to that of Sully-buds main char—
acters, Seth (Jonah Hill/Mark) and Evan (Mk
chael Cara/Pat).

Mark: Olei might need to clarify this a lite
tle bit, since I don't think my personality quite
matches Hill’s sexierazed lunatic, penlS’drﬂV‘k
ing peisona, determined to go after my high
school crush at all costs.

I must admit. though, that I love duty
jokes, would totally tell teachers how stupid
assignments are and just might boop my best
friend on the nose as a show ofaffection.

Par: 1 might be even more or a perfect
match with Evan.

Shocking as it may be,1’m slightly socially
awkward, have a horrible singing voice and
would never make the move on the girl every
one knew liked me. And I would need you to
drag me on a boozesbuying
excursion designed to get
girls wasted.

Mark: True, since I’m
sometimes convinced you
wouldn’t leave your dorm if
not for me.

But while I may be ad-
venturous, I would still pre-
fer if an old lady asked if
she could buy booze for me
rather than muster up the
courage to steal it myself.

Pat: Our friend group
even has a Fogell (Chris
topher Minterlasse), the
third member of the trio and the truly socially
inept character who at heart is really the cool
kid.

Especially when the local police officers
(Seth Rogen and Bill Hader) take him on an
allenight joyride ﬁlled with gains, beer and not
nearly enough Van Halen

Mark: Indeed Bur while out Fogcll may
not greet us with a hearty (that s up gangsters"
every morning, he does have an afﬁnity for
throwing “suck it" into everyday conversation.

(Real life McLovin, you know who are, and
you will be typecast for the rest ofyour life.)

Pat: Now, beyond our narcissistic dreams

Evan (Mirbae/Cem), logo/(Cirillopiti Mintz- -P/lm:) ml sew (faint/l Hill) enjoy a iiol- ro- openers/night iii superbad.

ofseelng ourselves on screen we should probe
ably address why Ell/Irrblld could be one of the
hnniest comedies' in recent memory.

Mark: Definitely. The
movie portrays high school
incredibly well, probably
due to the fact that writers
Rogen and Evan Goldberg
started the screenplay when
they were in high school.

Add the combination
of modern day comedy
genius Apatow producing
the ﬁlm, and you’ve got a
brilliant combination of
awkwardness, sot jokes and
throwaway pop culture ref-
erences.

Pat: The cast certainly
helps. Anyone who watched Ai'i’tlltd Deals/life
men! (which should be everyone) knows that
Cera plays young and awkward better than
anyone else in Hollywood.

It’s great to see Hill in a leading role are
tcr some stellar scenes in Knot/ml Up (think
“shmaslimortion”).

Regen is excellent as always and Hader
actually gets to prove he's funny after suffer-
ing through some terrible seasons of Saturday
NIgIIILi'ue.

Mark: But for all the talk about the movie’s
hilarity, none of the punch lines are over the
top, keeping the movie grounded in a state of

relatable reality.

Almost every joke is something rhar one of

us would say in high school, or just wished we
were funny enough to say.

Pat: And while Sit/kitted may look like
any other guysmhusingrgitls teen comedy, the
movie goes beyond that in its nearsperfeet
portrayal of guy love,

Every guy knows that they had a stronger
bond with their guy friends in high school
than with any girl they might have dared.
Would they go up to the rooftops to express
their love?

Mark: No, but we've definitely all thought
about it.

Pat: so with the summer ofJudd Aparow
now long past, can we make it so he comes out
with a movie once a month?

Mark: I don’t know if the human brain can
comprehend that many dick jokes and movie
references.

But it would give the group opratow dis
covered actors (Rogen, Hill,]enna Fischer and
Jason chel among them) enough roles for the
rest of their career.

Which might be the greatest thing to hap-
pen to Hollywood since the Brat Pack stopped
making movies.

on that note, I'm off to rhe nearest rooftop
ro profess my love for the Apatotv machine.

Pat: Samesies.
