Amendment
passes by
big margin

av Abav RAPOPORT

Around midnight Wednesday, just as stir
dents could begin to vote in SGA elections,
members of SGA Cabinet set out across carn-
pus in the freezing cold to respond to post-
er-s attacking their proposed constitutional
amendment,

The amendment added a second Vice»
President to the Cabinet, responsible for stuV
dent life issues in SGA, shifting the duties of
President,VrcevPresident and Student Service
Coordinator.

The amendment passed with over 75 per—
cent of student support, but caused controversy
among SGA members that may not disappear
so quickly.

Laura Lienneman'OS returned from abroad
to discover the amendment and quickly set to
workin opposing rt, plastering the campus with
anti-amendment posters. “I want to make sure
people know it’s okay to fight against Cabinet
sometimes," she said.

Her opposition to this issue is not new, but
instead came out ora year otdebare in SGA
last year.

“[The amendment is intended to] make
the President a more avarlable person, a better
ﬁgtrrehead for SGA,” said Michael Billups '07,
SGA VicerPresrdent.

The new position takes many committee
duties away from the President, particularly
regarding student affairs, leaving him or her
more time to iirteract with students. In ad-
dition, the new president would take a larger

Investing
with a heart

BY ARPI KARAPETVAN

Grinnell College's billionrdollar ens
dowment is generally considered one of the
school's greatest assets, but some students have
recently highlighted it as a potential concern.
Approximately half of the college's endow-
ment is invested in unknown equities. This
secrecy prompted some students to investigate
the college's investment practices.The colleges
opaque investing practices, they feared, might
allow or encourage the college to invest in run
ethical companies it might avoid under public
scrutiny.

Latona Giwa Y09 and Linn Davis ‘08 took
the ﬁrst step towards increasing student in—
volvement in the school's investing practices
by researching the institution’s policies. Later
joined by Rebecca Chohlas-Wood ‘10 and
SGA President Chris Hall ’07, the two pre»
seated a proposal to the board of trustees in
April 2006 to make the equities more transr
parent and release all the school’s investment
practices. Though the proposal failed, student
concern over the issue persisted.

According to David Clay, Treasurer of the
college, Grinnell does not want to release its

Tuition sticker shock?

BY MATTHEW HOROWITZ AND
JORDAN LEVINE

Joe Rosenfreld '25 often said that aftcr he
came to Grinnell,“you couldn't have driven me
out of there with a team of horses." But with
the impending tuition hike, many fear that it
may take less than n ream of horses to drive
prospective students away.

The proposed tuition increase, which will
be ofﬁcially approved by the Trustees some-
time this month, raises the price for incoming
ﬁrstryearsi The class of 2011, the ﬁrst to expe-
rience the new rate, will pay 12.5% more than
what firstryears paid this year as Grinnell's tur
ition wrll pass the $40,000 plateau. Returning
students will have to cope with a smaller raise
based on inﬂation. Some worry that these dnrr
marie changes will lead to a more privileged,
less diverse student body.

Because the greater tuition increase does
not apply to those students currently enrolled,
much of the concern over the rise has been
over its potential ability to deter some sni-
dents from applying, Low or middle income
students may be dissuaded by the cost of the
school, hampering the institution's ability to
attract a more diverse student body. “If they
raised tuition [for me],i might struggle to stay
here,” said Mike Kober ‘10.

Some students suggested that the true m0r
tivation behind the tuition raise is to attract
more students from wealthier families. Aer

cording to Mark Haley '07, “They are doing it
to add prestige to the school.They don’r want

’ it to look like a cheap school,” While wealthier

students would be able to help make rrp the
gap between costs and revenues, “More amn-
ent students are good for networking," said
Haley. “But it's not worth it if it comes at the
expense ot‘someons who's disadvantaged."

“Itwill be interesting to see how next year's
tuition hike for
ﬁrst-years will
affect diversity,”
said Emily Ja- in)
cobson 09. It is a
common concern
among students
that the tuition
raise will affect
not only prospeCr
tivc students from lowincome families, but
also prohibit many rtpplieanrs from middle
class families from applying.

Jim Sumner, Dean ofAdmissions and Fir
nancial Aid echoed some of these concerns,
also mentioning a fear or sticker shoek drin
ing down the number or applications. Sum'
ner sought to assuage concerns by pointing
to Grinnell’s generous financial aid program.
"Consistent with Gtinrrell's egalitarian history,
students that can afford to pay, ought to payA
student that cannot afford to pay will not have
to pay." The college is adamant about keeps
