It’s away promote economic diversity at Crinnell.At the end of each year, the
school looks at the ﬁnancial records ofall graduating students and ﬁnds those that
have excessive need-based loans. A committee of administrators reviews those
students and decides to reduce or forgive the loans of some.

Fmgiwr the rotations 2/» imminent! tbzm a rate o/mority?

Not really'lhe school turns either all or a portion of students’loans into grants,
which don’t need to be repaid.

So how fun I be one aft/me linden“?

Well, the only loans that count toward “excessive" are need-based ones. The
deﬁnition of excessive changes every year, since the college just forgives those
students with the very most debt in their r1ass.Wltcn rhc college has a lot to give
out, that can mean everyone with loans over $20,000 is in the running. Other
years, youd have to be in the hole more than $35, 000. And students must have
contributed to their college expenses bvwotking during the summers. If you took
out more loans than the school calculated you needed \ou re out of the running
tor forgiveness. From the pool otpcoplc who meet all those crircriu only some
are chosen.

Sn tub)! didn‘t I know "bruit Ibis?

Administrators don’t want students to expect to have their loans forgiven,
since even all those students with CXCCSSIVC loans don't get the lASt'Ihlnum help.
Financial Aid Director Arnold Woods describes the process like a scholarship in
reverse — a grant given at graduation instead oi’when you arrive on campus.

Hutu ”mtg/people gar Maren?

When die school has a lor of money to give out, they have forgiven rhc loans
ofas many as 70 students. in leaner years, the number is around 20 or 30.

Win-e dim l/JL‘ money came/win?

It’ s money thats left over in the college budget and also donations that are
earmarked for the program. In the past six years, thats amounted to between
$53, 000 and $170, 000 Some years get lucky and some dont. With the tuition
hike, though, the school is going to set aside $150,000 aycar for loan forgiveness
and Russel K. Osgood has discussed upping that number to 53 million in the
future — enough to forgive all seniors' loans.

Swt'lt, n7 tuba mu I paper a: gut my [1mm feign/m?

No one. Lucky seniors receive surprise letters

Is there another way?

MONEY MATTERS!

A run-down of the facts and numbers
about the proposed tuition increase

av SARAH MIRK

News ofGrinnell's tuition increase madc the front page ofthc
Des Moines Register last week, but if an administrator dropped
phrases like “market adjustment" oi “loan forgiveness” to a room
full of students, they’d probably be met Witl‘i awkward silence
and confused stares. Much of campus has no idea what the basic
elements and eflects ofthe increase actually are.

Schools around the country are in the midst ofmnjor rewrites
of their tuition policies, Princeton, for example, recently chose to
freeze tuition. Grinnell’s ﬁnancial plans aren’t just important to
curient and (especially) future students; the school’s policies and
the students'i'esponse have national ramiﬁcations as other colleges
and universities look for examples to follow, Pay close attention to
this quick and somewhat painless tuition tutorial and next weekend,
Feb. 9711, when the Trustees visit cimpus for their annunl spring
meeting and the SGA»organized open forum on Feb. 8, you’ll be
well-equipped to speak your mind and actually know what you‘re
talking about.

Think ofrhc tuition increase tliiswny: the real Cost ofntrcnding
Griunell, including everything from thc pennies spent on dining
hall potatoes to the cash expended on student summer research
grants to the paychecks handed to professors, is about $54,000 a
year. Interest on the much-loved gigantic college endowment pays
for about 50 percent oirhc cost ntrunning the school, and college
ﬁnancial aid meets 100 percent ofstudents federallyrdctctmincd
need so the average Grinnellian only has to shell out 48. 9 percent
of the cost ofliis other fairly priccy education.

For the last year and a halt, the Budget Committee and the
Trustees have been working on a plan to brrrnp the strident (and,
ahctn, student’s pnrcnts) contribution to education costs by 12.6
percent. That's the controversial tuition increase which will be
presented to Trustees at rhcir meeting next week and is vcry likely
to be approved.

Some students are upsct because it seems like Grinnell tuition
is on rise with no end in sight. Indccd, it has incrcnscd'evcryycar
students at here. Tuition docs increase a hrdc bir cvcry year in

But this year's announced tuition increase is making headlines
because it's much larger than the average 4 pcrccnr. Next years first

What about, uh, no tuition? No, seriously.

When the college ie-evaluated the
Strategic Plan three years ago, several
professors proposed an intcrcsting and
radical idea: abolishing Griuncll's
tuition altogether. “It seemed like if
this could happen, it could happen at
Grinnell," explained Clark Lrndgrcn,
Biology, who, along with Mark sch-
neider, Physics, drew up a rough plan
of how a tuition free Grinnell would
work (Mark Montgomery Economics,
also created a plan).

We were pretty convinced it could
work in a ﬁnancially neutral my,” said
Lindgren. “We proposed some num-
bers and made some big assumptions."
Big assumption number one is that
a tuition~free policy is so innovative
and progressive that it would bring
Grinncll major national publicity—and
major donors Itrherc are enough phil-
unthropic millionaires out there who
think a free liighereducation institution

churning out motivated and socially-
progrcnssivc students is exciting enough
to make them cut a check, then Grinnell
could bringin enough cash to onset thc
loss of tuition dollars. “Is this as much
as a potential goldmine as it seems like
it could be?” asked Lrndgrcn.

According to the professors’plan, in
a worst cast: scenario, rhc school would
lose $150 million. “It’s nor like we’re
going to go broke ifwc try this for ﬁve
years and it doesn’t work." Lindgrcn
noted that several famous and success
ful secondary education institutions are
tuition-frcc—America‘s military service
acndcmics. But for now, said Lindgren
“the plan is nnwhcrc."1r is a risky long-
shot and while the administration is
currently moving in a different direct
tron, there also wasn’t a groundswell of
faculty support for the plan when it was
pitched three years ago.

I think the big rdiﬁerence between now rind
[2005] is then, the news of the increase didn't
come out until very late in the process. It was
deﬁnitely sprung on students. Actually, the
reason it came out- is that Matt Cleinman 705
leaked it from Budget Committee [on which
he sat at an appointee]. Budget Committee is
kinda conﬁdential, but Matt leaked' it. Maybe
the administration saw that the reaction that
fostered is that people felt hermycd. 1 think

this time, they really did a better job prepar—_, ,

ing people for it, of explaining the rationale
behind it

I wouén’t characterize it us, “Wow, there

call a protest tomorrow and they’d probably get
