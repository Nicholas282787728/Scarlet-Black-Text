unfortunate fact for Grinnell students Whether one realizes' it
or not, those lovable, 'slcdabic,’ markablc old red (or maroon,
ifthey’vc been through the dish rnielune enough) tmys serve
several impoitnnt functions at this schoo

some of the rrsys, like rl1e ‘Trily Amigos or that awesome
e1gle rhnt someone carved were truly works of art, 11nd dee
served to be hungng tight lilongside rhe Mon1 Lisa or holding

What's more, people will have to sredl hordes ofthose ‘une

because they will lose more nfthem.

Carving on [rays didnr uppeel ro those worldly virtues
that Grinnellinns are supposed to have, but maybe students at
Gunnell simply don‘t h1ye those virtues. VVhltt we do know
is this: Dining Services could have just retired the really old
rod ones and replaced them with new rctl ones, and we'd all be
super happy.

Tripod Bob sez, “Tip well"

When frequenting Bob‘s Underground Cote,
if your bill'ista is especially nice. or makes your
drink just the way you like it with whipped
ererrn 1nd sprinkles, or plays 1 song 11 your
request, leave a little something in the tip jar. I
know, we’re all poor snltving college students, but
throw a little, something in there for the speciﬁer
ulﬂrly friendly service they always provide, Go all
our, empty your piggy bank, whatever. anpier
bnristas = happier Bob's.
