Arab-American
act'vist speaks

James Zogby, president of the Arab-
American institute, critiques action by
U.S. leaders in the Middle—East

What’s the one single biggest thing that students can do
to engage this debate?

Well, 1 think taking advantage of the fact you're in Iowa.
You get a oncerinrarlifetime opportunity as students to learn
about a process that very people in the country have a chance
to engage in. So, wherever you’re from,register to vote in Iowa,
and caucus in Iowa, and become a pait ofit, because the cducae
tion in this election isn'tjust during the campaign. But also the
caucus itself is, i think, a wonderful learning process of nego-
tiatiiig, orbargaining, ofclelmting issues. Because you not only
vote fol candidates at caucuses, but you also pass resolutions
that you can: about, So,1 think that would be my point to stu-
dents, is that you're here to learn, [and] one or the great learn»
ing experiences you can get is to caucus.

What theme runs through Middle East policy since Viete
nain? '

The biggest problem with US policy is that it's based on
ignorance.VVe do not know the rcgion,we donor know its his
tory,wc do not know its people, and we do not know its culture.
And because of that, we have based historically our policy on
issues other than those responsive to the peoples of the region.
Things like the imperial requirements of Britain and France,
or oil, or our need for oil. Issues like the Cold War, issues like
domestic politics, with some candidares being rather craven in
courting the vote of the prorlsrael community, whether that
was vote in some areas, or others areas where that was the relic
gious rlgl‘ir, the Christian right vote. So l think that ignorance
is the single most important factor, we don’t know the history,
we don‘t know their needs, and so based on ignorance we’ve
created bad policy.

As a corollary to that, you mentioned diplomacy, so may
be not in the last 30 years, but in the last seven, what have
been the problems with it?

So in the last seven years we haven't used diplomacy Dipltr
macy is not going and visiting people and talking to them. Dir
plornacy is what you talk to them about, And in the traditional
sets, diplomacy recognizes that there are different systems, and
there are competing ideologies, and there are different interests.
It is, by deﬁnition, seeking ways ofrcconciling differences.This
administration, having this neoconservative and Manichaeistic
