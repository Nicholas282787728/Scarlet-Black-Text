Cultivate home-grown talent at Grinnell

At the heighrol‘thi silmme' \velter,whcn most
ot‘ us were distracted by summer harhecues or interns
ships, Grinnell Couegc made li‘tnlttpagc news The
Do Mriiiri Region, Iowa's largest newspaper. put
Giinnell on the front page to cvplorc our scarcity of
iii-state student

Most ortlie cle points to Grinntlrs piice as the
cause {or our shortage of Iowans,
because “the Iowans at Grinnell
said they balance a stellar C(lllcar
tion with the stress of taking out
loans." But the ngult’l' decided to
end its article witll an incongruous
accusation: “It costs are perceived
to be out otbalance, so is Grin iell’s longstanding rcpr
utation as a liberal haven in mainstream Iowa."

The chntdr's shor glued and unfounded as
scssment of“conscrvative" Iowa values is selling Iowa
short. Iowa is not hoinogenous, politically or other
wise.

The Register aeted iriespoiisibly in ending its
[tonttpage article on Grinnell with a pithy adden-
dum.They spoke only with Jim Sumner, former dean
ofAclmissions and Financial Aid, who suggests that
Ioiinns “see our students as being a little too ortbeat,
activist, lettsleaning, a little too gayrtfi'iendlynnTo print
surnncr's point orview without asking Iowans if they
agree amounts to a shorttsightcd and unfounded as»
scssmcnt orowa values.

The Region insiniiatcs that Grinnell is fundat

mentally at odds with town. on the contrary, thc libt
tral arts—and Cllmlcllilnost certainly have a place
in this state, Oul “libelal"valiies are innovation and
inclusivenes .Thcse are two 01' [l‘iC units that make
Iowa a welcoming place to live.

In many ways, lnwa shares the values of other

Midwestciil states. And Midwesterncrs are not in
short supply at Grinnell.
You can't deny the (acts,
though At the moment, Grinnell
Couege is 13 percent Iowan, tar
short of tlle “ideal" 25 percent in-
state students that some tiustccs
refeience m the Rugii/ 's article.
The newlyratrlved class of2011,in particular, heasts
only 10 percent Iowans.

If Grinnell’s valiles and Iowa’s values are Compﬂk
rhle, why are Iowans tewei and runner between on
campus‘ Since we reject the assertion that Grinnell
and Iowa are incompatible, it follows that the college
is underpertoiming in terms otoutrcach. Low intstate
enrollment is not indicative oridcolog cal incompatt
ability hut seems rather to be a railtirc oroutreaeh to
Iowa communirics during the admission process.

Students from small and medlllm’SlZCd Iowa
towns frequently echo this assessment, shaiing that
they received few or no promotional materials from
Grinnell. Foi Grinnell to be a truly welcoming place,
the college needs to step rating it tor granted that lot
wans will know about Grinnell and feel wanted here.

Yet the presence otlowans on campus is also an
intlitator otstudents’ financial health

Iowans should be those students most educated
iihout and aware ofGliililell, and inclined to shell out
the big bucks to come here tor a homegrown cdtlcat
tion. But they aren’tﬂsr can’t. That's another reason
why the shortage ofloivails , troubling.

Tieat in-statc enrollment as a litmus test for the
ability oi‘niiddle- and lowcrrcl‘aso‘ students to afford
Glinncll. Tuition .lnd fccs now reach $42,422. That
price tag doesnt say, “Welcome," to the town stu—
dents who do hear about Gtinncll,The RL‘glJZtﬁ'l' did
get somcrhrrig right when they noted the huidens et
loans that Grinneuians are taking on.

In the last sentence ofthe Register-’5 articlc,Ttustce
Fred Little expresses his support or Grinneus val-
ucs. “Despite the ideological gap [benween Iowa and
G icll], Grinnell is not about to change its image."

Sounds like Little is proud of Griililcll's values
We are too. But if this “offbeat," “gay-triendly" c ins
pus doesn't do a bettel job of making a space for lot
wans,we undeiniine these values.

We reject the Region's insiriuation that Grinnell
is fundamentally at odds With Iowa The liberal
attsﬂiid Grinnelliinost Ccttainly have a place in
this agricultural state. Now we need to make it place
for Iowans, and in doing so, show em commitment
to attracting a diverse student population from all so-
cioeconomic backgrounds-Thurs just good Grinnell

Journalism at a small school often
feels like a juggling act with bowling
pills, Our pins—maintaining personal
relationships, trying to hold people
accountable and making the paper a
forum to student cxprcssimlgoftcn
seem to ceuide Inldrml as we attempt
to ltecp everything going, So this year
we want to rocus on making the paper
a forum, and we'll do our best to keep
everything else in the in,

To this end, the KGB is ﬁnally (ﬁ-
nallyl) getting a website. soon, we’ll
have a full-featured sitcwith articles ill

coming soon, until then check thct
sandhhlogspot coin) will hcconrc the
place people loolt to tor the latest ncns
from Grinnell,

We're also going to take advantage
ot‘a unique opportunity this semester:
the Iowa caucuses. We‘ll he running a
special caucus section every two weeks

with news, inteivicws and other inter-
lrlarioii related to this year's campaigns.
we want to work with student groups,
as well as community campaigner , to
give students a roller picture (For more
information, see page 4),

And as pundits ﬂood the state, we
want to emphasize the opinions on
campus. We're looking for more col-
umns this ycarv' i news, in spoits and
in aits. Some stories wrll lic more pcit
spccrive drivcn, Everyone should reel
welcome to contribute

Ultimately, we are reminded that
this is the student iitwspapei, a vehicle
rot debate and discussion on campus.
But the task of both reporting on stu-
dent . tivlties and icpiesenling the
students themselves can sometime
reel paradoxical, We will try to inv

the groups, we want to eiitrtpie and

so we'll continue to juggle oui- roles
