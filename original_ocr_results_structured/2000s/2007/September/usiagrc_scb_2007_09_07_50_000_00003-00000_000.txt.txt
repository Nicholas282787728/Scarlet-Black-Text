427 members
of class of 2011:
Biggest yet

While numbers from Iowa fail;
numbers of international students
return to prior levels

BY CHLOE MORYL AND
ELizAisErH Luqu
As students returned to
campus this week, may Ex-
pressed surprise after rumors
circulated that the first year
class had reached an un-
precedented population of
approximately 450 students.
While the ﬁrst-year class
has indeed exceeded initial
predictions, rhc impact was
not as large as first thought.
“There are 448 total
new students this semes-
ter," senior counselor Jim
Sumner clariﬁed. “With
448 new students, and 21 of
them transfer students, the
firsteyear class is about 427
firstsyear students. The goal
was 415, so we have 12 more
ﬁrstj’car students than we
ected,”
Seth Allen, dean ofAd—

”The head/inesscream ’Grl‘nne/lhasmised
luiiion!’50 we omit/pared a change in the

behavior of our applicants.”

Seth Allen, Dean ofAdmission and
Financial Aid

mission and Financial Aid,
said that the unexpected
over»enrollment reﬂected
an increase in demand for
Grinnell College.

“The headlines scream
‘Grinnell has raised tuition!‘
so we anticipated a change
in the behavior of our up—
plicants," said Allen. “As‘a
result of raised tuition, we
admitted more students, but
as it turned out the yield was
signiﬁcantly higher than we
expected.”

But with an increase in
numbers, the bar Moirrrr
Riga/tr and others have
raised concerns about the
decreasing number oflowan
students coming to Grinnell
each year.

Sean War-lick ’08, a nae
tive Iowan, said that while
the decision to come to
Grinnell was not difficult
for him, other Iowans see it
differently

“People at home are bar
sically in the box of going
to either the University of
Iowa, Iowa State, or the local
community college," he said.

Sumner explained this as
more ofa problem ofi‘epurae
lion.“EverytopIowastudent
should look at Grinncll," hc
siiid,“bui what we're fighting
is a reputation that says we're
too activist. too lefrrlean‘lug,
too gityrfricndly and to a

ior of iowan parents, that's
worrisome."

Warllck said he was not
concerned about his par»
ents’ views, but rather with
his friends’. “My parents
were indifferent, but they
understood the choice was
up to me and were proud
that I had gotten in," he
said. “Some of my friends
didn't quite understand
it the little they knew
[about Grinnell] was like,
‘Why would you choose to
go there? It‘s kind of out
there)"

Allen argued that the
difference in Iowan srur
dents was not unusual, “The
number of students from
Iowa [this year] dropped
from 52 to 46, but histori-
cally it's pretty much in line
with where the college has
come in past
years.”

And ale
though the
number of
Iowans is
lower, the
number of
i n t c r n a -
tional iirst‘
years has riscn, from 38 in
2006 to 60 this year. which
is closer to the numbers for
international enrollment in
2004,

Sumner said that this
ﬂuctuation is the result of
significant changes in ildr
missions and financial aid
policies for international
students, including adapts
ing to the elimination of
international needrbljnd
admissions.

“Last year was the first
year ofthe new policy ...we
thought [the number of in-
ternational students] would
skyrocket, but it didn’t," said
Sumner. “We just rinketed
with that onerycal’ history
with this policy in place.
Before, we had no history,
which is why we ended up
shy, and now after this one
year of history we overshot
our target number."

As a secondary reason,
Sumner cited the boom-
ing Asian economy and
increased cooperation with
foreign embassies.

Overall, Allen and Sum-
ner viewed the total increase
as a positive development
for thc college, “Demand
for Grinncll is high,” said
Allen. "it's 1| good sign for-
rhc collcgc that wc have a
large class on campus."

Student misses SA training

Despite permission, some student staff and RLCs question ability to serve

llY KENDALL Hibonnmrv AND MATT ZMUDKA

The Grinuell residence life staff operates as a tezimistiir
dcnt atlvrsois, residence life coordinators and administrators
work together for the safety and beneﬁt ofstudents.When one
SA could not attend iequiicd trarning, however, controversy
erupted within this usually cohesive and peaceful team,

Citric Scott '10, the SA for Lazrchhird, was unable to
mend studcnt stiff [ruining three weeks ago due to an unr
crpctrcd opportunity with her internship. Scott was told shc
could continue as an SA. After her return, however, some staff
members protcsrtd thn dctrsion,

Scott had contacted Sheree Andrews, associate dean of
Housing and Residence Life, and Jennifer Bienick, RLC for
East Campus, prror to returning to notify them that she would
be riiiiving latcr than erpccrcd, “[An-
tlrcws] told me that shc was happy that
I had this opportunity and moral me to
honor lhv corumlrrncnls,"Scott said.

According to Andrews, internships are
out: of the most common conﬂicts with
trrrrnmg ”An rrrrcrnship is a once-in—ar
lifetime opportunity," said Andiews—who
noted that as the number ofstudents with internships increases,
tramrng might have to be modified. “This is part of their life,
but they need to be making connections for the rest of their
life"

SA training is a six-day program,duiing which members of
student stafflearn relationship skills and first aid, how to deal
with mental health issues, and how to respond in various crisis
situations. “We don't want to disrnrss its importance by allow
ing students to miss training," said Andrews. “It’s an integral
part ofthe program." Although Andrews and Bieniek approved

”/f/ hadn’t felt Mic I (all/ll do iii/5,
/ would have backed out. ”

her absence, some RLCs and SAs felt that her absence was inr
excusable.

“When the student staffacccpts rhc position, they sign a
contract saying that they'll be back by the start orrrainmg,"said
Brad Menard, RLC for Smounkcr,

“Some student staffrclr strongly that anybody who missed—
and some of the RLCs, too," added Andrews, "that anybody
who missed training should not be on staff," She also said that
being an SA is a volunteer position, and that the sittration’s ours
comc may have been different if it was a paid position.

“There was some conﬂict, definitely, that we had to work
through, so we listened to everybody’s sides and came up wrrh
some options,”Andrews snid.Alternate SAs are trained for each
dorm cluster, but they are allowed to decline an open position.

After these options were discussed with
residence life staff, other student staffaud 3dr
ministration, Scott was allowed to continue.
She is now receiving oneronronc training
that Bieniek described as “intense.” ScottY
however, had hoped she could begin her in-
dividualized training carlierr “I planned to be
busy when 1 got back, and instead I've spent
time in meetings," she said, Scott added that although she feels
unsure that she will be allowed to remain an SA, she is still
conﬁdent in her abilities, “Ifl hadn't fclt like I could do this,I
would have backed out,"said Scott

Resident of Lazier Third David Garson ’11 did not fccl
that Scott’s delayed training would have any effect on her per-
formance. “She seems like a nice person. I don't see what else
someone would cxpccr an SA to have done so far,"said Garson.
“it seems like it's being blown out ofproporrion.1 don't under-
stand what the big deal is,"

NSO

from p. l Wye"

The initial portrayal ofGrinnell was
not the only issue. “There were a lot ofproblems that added
up to bigger problems," said POD lcadcr Christy Boeckholt
’02. One such problem occurred with the annual NSO program
Sex Srgnals, which uses improvisation to examine the toprcs of
relationships, sex and date (ripe.

During lunch the day after thc program, it was intended
that ﬁrstsycnr studcnts would meat in rhcir mm to discuss
the program and to prepare first—years for the diversity pros
gram, American Voices, which was to take place the following
mghr, However, this discussion ncvcr occurred. “I don’t really
remember any discussion," said Lynn, “the PODs were weird
because you met only a few rrmts and ncvcr saw anyone rrfrcr
thatYou could do the same rhing with ﬂoor groups."

“We went in rhcrc thinking there would be specifically lat
belcd rabies it."s:id POD leader Lindsay Dennrs'os in regards
to the lack oforganizarion tor the Sex Signals discussion. “At
11:00 (here was nothing on the tables."For reasons that remain
unclear, thc labels rhar were supposed to be on the dining hall
(ables allowing POD groups to meet were not there. In fact,
gtncral conhrsron seemed to be the norm with regard to POD
discussions, “There was no set time for PODS to meet, Last
year they met rrttcr talks, but this year there was no set time.“

For Dennis, the lack of discussron suggests that Grinnell
was not interested in making discussion of sexual assault an
importanr parr otho. "On the onc hand you can say rhrs is a

small thing or a miscommunication," Dennis said,"but it's still
something that's very any to do that didn’t happen."

Firs .lr Lynn, however, felt that the Sex Signals play con-
veyed a w‘ guess on the part of the campus to be candid with
new students. “It's important not to hide these things from you.
I like the openacss of the campus."

The lack of discussion distressed Krohn as well, who re-
mains hopeful that the conversation regarding Sex Signals will
strll happcn. “I know people wcrc upset about [the lack ofdrs-
cussion] and I was upset too,” said Krohn. “I still would like
to have rhat discussion with our ﬁrst years because I think
the topics are two very important components of our educa—
tion here [at Grinnell] and we will be doing a follow up."It is
intended that this future discussion will take place through the
residence halls, facilitated by the residence life staff.

Regardless of the problems that occurtcd during NSO,
Krohn felt the program succeeded in its overall mission. “There
are still some rough spots that we need to work on further and
have more conversations about, but I think we did what we
set out to do which was get students ready for the first day of
class,” she said.

Plans for next year's NSO remain unclear. Krohn intends
to bcgin meeting with the N50 committee this fall to receive
feedback for next year's orientation so that they may begin
planning next year's intricate orientation. "1 would welcome
feedback from [firstrycdr] students and whether they thought
they were ready for Thursday," said Krohn.
