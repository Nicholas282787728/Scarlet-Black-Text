There is no bigse et )0"! the divide
between local Grinncll c an and Grinncll studcnls.
While many individuals on both sitlcs contribute to the
pioblenis, others, like women's basketball captain Emily
l<olbc '07, are trying to tear down the wall

“Not a lot of students from Giinncll High School
choose Grinnell College,” Kolbe said. “Everyone is kind
of aware ofa discord between ‘townics’ and college stur
dents," Kolbc physically adds the quotations to the word,
because she hetselfis a “townie".

Coach Andrew Hamilton recruited Kolbe duiing his
first year coaching the womcns basketball tcam “When
lbee'ame womens basketball coach in the spring ofzooz
I vowed that I would ieciuit any playei from the com
munity ofGtinnell who showed inteiest in the College,"
he said.

The college was not an easy sell to l<olbe, who was
stiongly considering Kenyon College in Ohio until she
finally buckled and took a visit to Grinnell College to
meet the women’s basketball team. Kolbe now believes
the college is a perfect fit for her.

“it's nice because I've bccn able to separate from the
town. so i feel like I'm getting a true college expericnce,"
she said. “At the same time, I'm able to discover new as
pects ofrhe town, like the peispeenves ofall the students
that come fiom so fai away to attend school here."

Hamilton believes the assets Kolbe brings to the
college and the team extend far beyond hei play on the
court.

“The benefits of having a local player on your team
are many," Hamilton said. “Since Emily is so well—re»
specred in the community ofGi-innell, our program has
gained support and attention from people in town,"

Emily agrees, and she has seen the benefits firstr
hand.

“I think it's nice for people to see that there are
Grinnell community students attending Grinnell Col-
lege," Kolbe said, “People who watched me play in high
school came to the college games, even iftliey didn’t be—
fore. It gives people a more intimate view ofthe college
and connects them closei to the students,"

Despite being a hometown celebrity, mainly for the
kids that play basketball at halftimes in Darby Gym,
Emily is finally ready to take a look at things outside of
her hometown.

“I’d like to move away from Grinnell after gradua-
tion; I’ve been here for awhile," Kolbe said. “[0 innell]
has been such a huge part ofmy life I can definitely see
myself if not actually living back here, at least visiting
my parents all the time. Its a gieat place to be and it will
always be a part of me.

Both Grinnell citizens and college students can catch
Emily and the Pioneers in action tonight at 5.00 pm.
against Carroll college in Darby Gym.

Keith Chamberlain the “main guy"

by DAN HARDIN
When I told Coach David Atscneault I wanted to
ask him about one of his role players, Kcith Chamber»
lain '08, he was quick to correct me. “Role player?" he
asked, surprised. “We go as Keith goes. He is the main

gu)That may come as a surprise to Grinnell basketball
fans, who follow the awards, headlines and statlines atr
tachcd to the names of John Gtotbetg ’09 and Dave
Arseneault ’09. But while those two aie providing the
offense through their scoring and passing, Chamber-
lain is anchoring the defense.

At 6'8"(7’5" with the Afro...or so it seems), Chums
betlain is one of the most recognizable students on
campus and one ofthe most intimidating on the hard
wood. When the Pionceis’ opponents break the press
and charge down the court for a 2~on~1 or 3ronri fast
break, Chamberlain is the last line of defense. Shorter
opponents will often turn back, fearing that their shot
attempt will only end up increasing Chamberlain’s
MVVCrleading block total (33).

This intimidation reinforces Chamberlain’s value to
the team. “It feels good to know I’ve made the other
guy nervous, that 1 know I've made my presence felt,"
he said. “Aftetl block a guy once, 1 can tell he’s thinkr
ing ofme the next time he goes up."

Because of his size, Chamberlain feels as though it
is his role to block shots and grab rebounds. Offen-
sive rebounds are especially important to The system,
and Chamberlain does his job well. His 7.3 boards per
game are good enough for fifth in the conference, and
his 2.55 offensive rebounds place him at third.

While his rebounding and defensive skills have

filled a big need for a Giinnell team that has no other
player over as”, teammates and coaches alike Want to
see more offense from the big man.

“Coach wants him to demand the ball more,"sald
Ahmed Idrissa '09. "People think we just shoot threes,
but we want to establish a low post presence, too."

Coach Arsenelult is aware ofthc added strain such
expectations could put on the Chicago native, who is
also battling a nagging ankle injury, “The System is
harder on big guys," he said. “And we have been asking
for more out ofhim even though his body is aching."

But Chamberlain has hardly been a slouch on the
offensive end of the floor. He is averaging 13. 2 points
pcr game and shooting 63 percent from the field in
MWC play Chamberlain has also thrown doWn some
rim iattling dunks at home games this season caus-
ing a pandemoniurn in Darby Gym. And, since this is
Grinnell, Chambeilain steps out behind the lite on ocr
casion, where he is a respectable 729,

“If [the point guard] sees five defenders in front of
him [as he brings the ball down the court,] 1 will get
the ball at the top of the key and shoot a wide open
three, Chamberlain explained, “That's about the only
time you will see me shoot a three."

His ability to make that shot is important to The
System, forcing defenders to account for him and not
double the point guard as he brings the ball up the
floor.

Chamberlain and the test of the Pioneers host
back-to-baek MWC opponents this weekend in Darby
Gym as they face Carroll College tonight at 7 pm. fol—
lowed by st. Norbert tomorrow at 3 pm.

What is your role on the team?

Myiolc is to catch cvcry pass tliiown
at me, finish undei the basket when
i get the ball and rebound. in geneial
the best players around the league
are post players. My job is often to
shut down the oppositions leading
scorct and deﬁnitely their leading
rcbounder, and I love it. This year
as a captain, my role has been to
keep things positive and constantly
encuuiage my teammates.

My iole on the team includes just
about cvciything, both on and off
the court. As a captain I look at my
iolc as an opportunity to biing the
team together and develop a winning
attitude. in fact, the team cohesion
that we have is one of the main
reasons for our recent success,

What drew you to Grinnell consideringy‘o u may not be a

"typical: player here, and how do you ﬁt in to

i had no idea 1 was not going to be
a “typical player here. When 1 was
recruited, the team was graduating
an allrconfcrencc post player
and much of the Grinnell offense
to that point includcd the post a
lot. That changed my sophomore
year when we experimented with
running the system, something that
many current team members who
remember that year call the biggest
mistake ever.

What is it like playing
with Hannah Wolf, and how
does her scoring ability affect
what the team can do?

Hannah is one of my best friends
on the team, so I love [playing
on a team with her]. . I have to
echo Coach Hamilton’s words
of her in last week’s 5&3 about
how she has risen her complete
game this season. One of my best
basketball memories from this
year was the Cential game, the
reason being is that I felt Hannah
and I were completely on the same
page. I knew instinctively all of hei
movements that game, and it felt
like she knew mine, I don‘t think
I have ever felt as connected to one
of my teammates on the floor as
I did with her that night For the
most part, 1 love playing with her,
and she knows the few occasions
when that has not been the case.

he System?

I feel that I bring a unique aspect
to the team because of my more
conventional game. I think that
I bring balance to the team. I came
[to Grinnelll as a baseball player
and student. However, I couldn't
stay away from the game that I love
and decided to play [basketball] my
freshman year. In fact, it has been
one of the best decisions that I have
made.

How do you feel about all of
the publicity that the leading
scorers get, and does it affect
team morale?

If anything, all of the attention
that [John Grorberg and David
Arseneault] receive actually boosts
team morale.The system was actually
invented to give the team numbers to
look at in losses, which used to be
more frequent, so any attention that
we get from individuals or from the
team is good for our program we
have a great group of guys and we all
pull for [each other].

What are yourlgoals for the season and your basketball career

in general? How
as a player?

I want fans and coaches to remember
me as someone who always left her
heait on the ﬂoor. As far as goals.
we have the top 3 teams in the
conference coming into out gym
and a really tough road game at
Monmouth that account for four
of our remaining six. 1 hope above
ull else the team is extraordinarily
positive and supportive of each other
like we have been for most of the
season.

0 you want fans and coaches to remember you

This season I am focused on winning
a MWC championship and making
it to the national tournament. I would
like fans and coaches to remember
me as a player that did whatever it
to k to bring the team together and
wm,
