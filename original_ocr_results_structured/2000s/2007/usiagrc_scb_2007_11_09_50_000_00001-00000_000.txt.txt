Sexual exploration was in the spotlight
this week, as the Feminist Action Coalition
(FAC) sponsor-ed another seven-day celebra—
tion ofthe body Despite initial problems with
ol'grlniz ion and funding, Love Your Body
\Ncek kicked off on Monday, Nov, 5. with a
full schedule ofold and new events.

Usually, the annual week long celebration
is organized by FAC, but this year the Stones
wall Resource Center (SRC) and Bi Focal lent
support and funds to put together a setics of
speeches, discussions and movies that support
the week’s focus on body image and sexual
awareness.

Several new events made an appearance
during this year’s Lovc'vour Body Week: the
male masturbation workshop on Tuesday night
and the Let’s Talk About Sex (And Other
Srufll) discussion on Wednesday Both events
sprung from an effort to be more inclusive of
males and orhcr groups who have complained
in the past ot’a lack of opportunity to Patrick

are not normally mentioned, either m classes
or in the media, said workshop co»leadcr

the body and disorders and stuff, it‘s always
about women."

Proposed in-house drugpolicy stalled

Administration hesitant to move forward with initiative after negative police response

ixvjuua 3011‘th

Following months of discussion and ne-
gotiation between administrators and the
Grinnell Police Department, plans for the imp
plementation of a new college “imhouse’ﬂrug
policy have stalled in light of the department’s
“uneasiness” with the potential changes,

"I don't want to be in the position where
our polrcics conflict with the police bccduse
that sets up a bad relationship," explained
Crady. “I respect where [Police Chief] Jody
E‘Miltherly] is and we're going to do what we

The iii-house drugs policy, strongly sup-

Violence
on— campus

. BVJULIA BOTTLES

This year’s Halloween Harris party ended
violently for some students and staff mem*
bers after police were called to campus twice
to respond to r student who assaulted several
people. While Grinncll College Security is

,usually capable of handling parricrs who turn
violenmhc escalation ofthe assaults on Satur-
day promplcd Security to contact the Grinncll
police,

According to Grrrrnell Police Depucment
Chicfjody lVlathcrly, officers responded to it
call from the Grinnell College Security oftice
late Saturday night. Appearing on the scene of
a domestic dispute. the ofﬁcers calmed those
involved in the situation, “The officers' initial
reports just told me they were able to handle
it verbally,"Matherly said. “And they were able
to handle the problem without making an ar-
rest, which we usually try to do."

But when the police left the scene they
were promptly called once again for an assault
in progress involving the same individual.
“I’m told, and I'm still looking at reports, that
they only got a block avmy and said, ‘Get back
here,"'Mathetly said. “So something happened
almost immediately"

The polree turned around and responded
to the assault in progress, Members of the
campus community including students and
staff were involved in the altercation during
which Matherly conﬁrmed the officers “did
deploy a taser." With the assailant subdued,
the police then made an arrest.

Veronique Porter ’08, one of the heads

of All-Campus Events Security, said that an
incident involving the police is unusual. Still,
snidents working security at Harris must as,
casionally confront violent partiers. “Most of
the time, when ACE steps in to try to diffuse
the situations, they incur the assault," Porter
said. “It’s not like it happens a lot, but we've
definitely had spitters, people throw beer. oc-
casionally the assault It comes with the
ob,"
J From Porter's perspective, the need for
police on campus was unusual. “This year in
particular, things have been very, very chill as
far as stuithappening at Harris,"shc noted. “1
can only think of one time last year when we
actually had to call campus security It hasn’t
escalated to larger things in awhile."

The incidents of Saturday night have
prompted many questions from members of
the campus community about the prevalence
ofassault on campus and the college's policies
regarding its handling. Although each event
is different and must be handled individually,
there are some normal channels that students
may go through from reporting the incident
to Security to the ﬁnal charges laid out by the
Grinnell College Hearing Board.

Both Director of Security Steven Briscoe
and Marherly agreed that students most often
call Security rather than the Grinnell Police
Department when an incident breaks out, “if
it’s a fight, an altercation, generally the sure
denrs call Security fun because rbntsjusr who
they call,” Matherlv said “Thins who they
know

When a Security offrccr responds to an ass
sault, they assess the severity of the incident.
