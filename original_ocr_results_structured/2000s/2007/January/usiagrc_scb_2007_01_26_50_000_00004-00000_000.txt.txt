Ev ANAND BALASUBRAHMANVAN

For a few years when l was growing up, my
father celebrated Christmas Eve by plopping my
brother and me in the family van and driving us
past the Twin Cities airport to the sprawling park-
ing lots of the Mall of America. Inside, mobbed by a
frenzy of last-minute shoppers fighting for novelty
T-shirts and high-brow Arnold Schwarzenegger
comedies, my father would declare, "Boys, this is

capitalism.”

This year, I arrived home
from a semester abroad in
Turkey two days before
Christmas. Being back at
homeI felt a little out ofplacc,
like bits of the American in
me had bcen drowned in yet
gun and lentil soup. Rather
than draw out the long, pain-
ful transition into rc-bccom-
ing an American, I decided
to revive my father's tradition
and take an immersron crash
course in Americanism, drag-
ging my 17»year-old brother
to the Mall of America, per
haps purchasing a cookie the
size of my head from the fine
dining kiosk of RB. Loco’s
Peanutbutterliciaus Cafe. Be»
sides, after two days fumbling
for an answer to “How was

Turkey?" for each and every
member ofmy regrertably ex-
tensive family, I was ready to
cut and run from the whole
grandparents and gingerbread
thing.

My brother drove and the
parking lots were so crowded
he parked in a spot labeled
“Reserved for Expecting
Mothers" (“They can't prove
shit," he reasoned). We en-
tered the mall through the
sears, flanked by a colossal
wall of cordless drills and a
coffee shop blasting sugar
Ray. Stepping into the vast
inner circle of The Mall, we
were immediately greeted by
a plusrsize debutarrtcs' clothe
mg outlet and a Cinnabon.

We stood there, stunned

for a minute by the four
stories of novelty boutiques
spiraling upwards above us
and the sheer mass of people
swarming through the ﬂun-
rescent-lit canyon between
storefronts. To convcy some
scitse ofthc scale of the Mall:
there are sit stores which are
Minnesota themed, two of
which are named “Minnc»
sot-ahl"
slogan is “I want it,l need it.
I have to have it!" From our
place outside Sears, we saw
old men in camouflage hunt-
ing gear drinking in a Ca-
ribbean-themed bar. Nearby
were petulant goth prcetecns
hanging outside ofHotTopic
wrth shirts that read “I see
stupid people."

My brother elbowcd rnc
in the ribs and pointed to the
counter of“Sacks in the City."
I turned in time to see an cl-
derly white woman in a pink
velour swcatsuit physically
grappling with a young black
woman in a red velour sweats
suit over position in the check
out line. All around us ﬂowed

Elsewhere, a stores

a mix of cthmcrncs that
would probably never bc seen
together outside or rhc us
and deﬁnitely nor in a place
like Turkey wltcrc identify
ing with certain ethnic groups
is discouraged or prevented.
Somalis, Hmong and Irish
all jostlcd each other in rho
Mail's overcrowded corridors,
like wc'd fallen into a middle
school MLK Jr. Day mural. It
occurred to me thatThe Mall
is it distinctly American uto-
pia where vague patriotism
and sliopaholism unite even
the most diverse customers.
Then it occurred to me thatI
really wanted a Crnnabon.
Ripping sugar-soaked
dough from my pastry, my
brother and I moved further
into the Mall, Around the
first bend, the storefront can—
yon opened up to reveal an in-
door theme park reekirrg with
that distinct blend of CthT
rim: and funnel cake. When
I was growrng up rn St. Paul,
this park was called camp
snoopy and had ridcs based
of? the comic strip Peanuts,

My brother winced and told
me about being forced to man
the Spongcbob Sqaurcpants
ride for an more Saturday,
with that horrible theme song
playing on rcpear, for a char»
ity event. As I got older, park
offrcials must have slowly re
alizcd that their target demo
graphic had either never read
or heard of the comic and
replaced a ride based off the
character Woodstock with a
giant swinging axe.

Overall rhc feel of the
mall hadn't changed much
since I was younger, except
for the Mail‘s OC-inspircd
insistence on bcmg called “the
MOA. The whole placc ace
tually seemed kind of quaint.
It didnt take as long as I had
remembered to walk around
the entire Mall, and the giant
Christmas wreaths that hung
from the ceiling had a cer
tain Minnesotan modesty. It
was comforting to once again
be surrounded by a familiar
consumer culture and under
stand the impulses behind
different marketing ploys

 

and fashion trends. When a
man in a large carroon shark
suit marched past me it made
complete sense: that man
was advertising for the large
est underground aquarium
in the United States. I never
found the headtsized cookie
store, but my brother com-
pensated by buying a Teshirt
with a sombreroewcaring frog
announcing “I'm Toadsrly
Wasted!” As we left thc Mall
we stopped at a bargain bin
of straightrtovDVD movies. I
pulled a Rob Schneider film
out ofthc bin. Even though I
hate malls, I was reassured to
be in a familiar place. For me,
the chaos of The Mall was
steeped in tradition and, like
an old TV Christmas special,
its stale lessons didn't teach
me as much as they made me
feel a part of a shared cul—
ture. thn I told this to my
brother he told me that the
only reason I felt comforted
was because I liked to sneer at
people i feel better than. This
was also the truth.
