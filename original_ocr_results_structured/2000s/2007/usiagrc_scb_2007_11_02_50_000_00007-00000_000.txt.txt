 

Giving back to its residents: Shabby-Chic House

IivCIILoEMoIle

"I like to think that our house used to
be shabby, and now it's becoming chic,” said
Sarah Boyer'OS, inhabitant of1132 Broad Star
which residents refer to either as “Shabby-
Chic House" or “The Giving House."

The ﬁve members of the house, all class of
H08 lIke to ﬂunk of themselves, and not just
their house, In terms of stages between slIabe
by and chic.' The) agree r°harl>hocbe Souza
and Mary Pat Twumey are nearer to the side of
chic ness, whereas Nora Shields Kate MoIley
and Boyei tend toward shabby. ”

The house. on the otheI y,liand was une
doubtedly shabby when the ﬁve of them
moved III "When Sarah got here, there was a
mold infestation' In the basement, and probe
abli about 10 yeaIs worth of trash and junk
said Shields Vl’hile the basement now is com-
pletely clean and erupt), it remains unused as
a result of its “assihapping cold" temperatuie
and copious spiders.

“The spiders are HUGE! I tried to vacuum
one up, but it was so strong and mutant that it
was able to avoid the suction of the vacuum
cleaner!" Boyer said.

Another distinctive room for the residents
is one they started to call “the
stupid roomf'l‘hs room is full
of, for lack of a better term,
stuff. When the five of them
ﬁrst moved in, they went
through the kitchen and re-
moved any extra items to this
room. "I like to think of the
stupid room as more like the
Room of Requirement," said
Boyer, teferencing the Harry
Potter series.

“We had like {out can
openers and a random toaster oven, some
‘SWCSICI'Sr a boy scout shirt, disco attire, downs
hill skis, just random stuff," said Souza. This
is where the name [he Giving House comes
from, as the house itself has arbitrarily pro»
vided useful things.

However random the room may be, the

stupid room holds value for Shields: “It's not
stupid! It makes coffeel"

The house, afteI its shabby—torchic trans-
formation. now has brightly colored rooms.
with no two adjoining rooms painted the same
colort

One ofMorloy's two rooms, complete with
a swing, is now a sunny yellow wirh mange
trIm though the paint color was not always so
cheerful “The girl that used to live here tried
ro convince us rirar it was maroon Nope Deﬁr
nitely poop-brown," said Shields.

“With electric blue trim!” chimed In Boy-
ct,

The house member's didn't keep the drab
coloring rot long “One or the iirst things we
did was turn on some really loud music and
painted the room yellow," said Souza.

1n addirion to this bonding acrivity, the
housemates try to haIe fam' diuneIs togeth-
el on Sunday nights and have lunch together
on most weekdays Other activities are more
seasonal “Remember to bring stuff tonight,
Sonzit reminded Twomey. We re making a
dav-of- the-dead altar tonight!"

The bonds between the housemates have
also led them to make up nicknames for each
other, from “MP"forMary Fat to
“Nunu Louise" for Nora. “Most
of the time when 1 get emails
from any of them, they won't
be addressed to Phoebe; instead
it'll be ‘Dcar Plioebemama’fsaid
Souza.

These nicknames could por
tentially have been developed
during their “game-hunting trip
for wildebeest and carnivorous
squirrels endemic to Namibia,"
which is how they all met, 21:7
cording to Boyer.

“Sadly, there’s no real interesting story as
to why we all live together," said Shields. “We
knew the people that lived in this house when
we were freshmen because we partied here a
few times, and since then we've wanted to live
in this house."

 

 

Though these girls are very cohesive and
close as a group, they all like the house for dif-
ferent reasons. "I live in LA. and I've never
lived in a place where I can look out my w' .
dow and see trees and grass!" said Souza. As
their house is full ofceilingeto-ﬂoor windows,
Souza can admire the fall foliage from her
bedroom.

For Twomev, her favorite part of the house

is the sizable sun porch attached to her room.
“The only problem with it is that there's no
door handle so I have to open it by jamming
a pair of scissors in it," said Twomey."1 haven’t
been out there since {all break rhough ... prob-
ably because 1 can't and my scissors"

Boyer helpfully added that they might be
in the stupid room.
