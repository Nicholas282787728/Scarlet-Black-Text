This wcckwc join our heroes as they discuss the merits and
drawbacks of their lair in the Cowles apartments. Tim, Mike
and Wyatt are sitting on the couch in their llving room which
ing Wyatt play video games while Sipping some beers. on a
Monday dftelnoon.

Tint: Listen, guys, I’m sick of people telling us how nice
our apartment is. All 1 heat is, “Oh, wow, you have air condr
(inning! How nwcsomcl" Well guess what; our air condition
ing only goes down to a balmy 50 degrees. and it can’t even
maintain that temperature with the windows open‘ That might
be acceptable it‘ we lived in Alaska, but after spendlng a day
barefoot in the apartment with the air conditioning set as low
as it can go, my toes STILL didnt have frostbite. Now all my
tnittens and scarves ate wot-thl , .. all I need is slippers and
a blanket.

Wyatt: And without subezeto temperatures, how am 1 supe
posed to accurately recreate the Donner Family Experience?

Mike: Come on, now. We have it a lot better than most
students. After nil. the school gave us thisTV.

Tim and Wyatt: Shut up, Mike!

Best Senatorial

This year was a break with tradition:
Wedge Antilles, perennial black sheep, re
ceived very few write-in votes in the sena-
torial race. Maybe his campaign is ﬁnally
giving it a rest since they got the campus
pub named after him, Here are our other
favorite political never-beens. pulled from
this week's votes.

Hey Virgo, you might be loose, but you are not
ready. stay in this weekend and make yourself useful.
By the way, the person you’ve been making eyes at
all week totally saw you walk into that pillar in front
of the JRC. You might want to stop staring at the
ground all the time. And get a new shirt. That one
you've been wearing all week just isn't that ironic.
Also, avoid all Libras they’ve got it out for you.

the things it's been working on littely—ljke ex
