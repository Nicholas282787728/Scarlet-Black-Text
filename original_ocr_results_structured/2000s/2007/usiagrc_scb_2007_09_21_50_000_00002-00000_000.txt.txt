Frenetic clocks
find their rhythm

BY KARI DiEDRlCI-is AND VICKY OGRODOWSKI

For students who spend most oftlieir class time watching
the clocks, the first few weeks ofihe semester have been a little
olrkilter. The second hand on clocks in all academic buildings
would pause every five seconds, jump to the next fivcrsecond
interval in a spastic fashion and continue to do so all the way
around the clock. For many, the odd jumps were causing mic

nor distractions in class. “[The clocks]

are unique timekeeping instru-

ments," said Karl Kremling

'10, “and mildly perplexing.”

Kremling was not the

only one perplexed by the

clock antics. When asked

about the confusion, Asso-

ciate Dean for Student Life

Michael Sims said,“l’mjust

as Confused as you.“

The Primex clocks, ins

stalled in academic buildings

this past summer, were intended

to be completely synchronized to

each other, explained Associate Di-

rector of Facilities Management Rick Whitney. Ideally, the

second hands of the atomic clocks would move smoothly and

keep perfect time. Because the clocks are atomic, however, any

loss of power causes the system to go into what Whitney called
a “learn mode"[or 24 hours.

It is this learn mode that created the oddjumps last week.
Whitney said that“powerwas interrupted to the Primex trans-
mitter several times last week,” and each time the power was
interrupted the learn mode began again. This week. however,
the jumps have stopped and the clocks appear have “learned"
what they need to and are working normally. The second hand
is moving smoothly again, and will hopefully prevent any fur
ture class disruption.

rues-w:
- Last week‘s Joint Board election results misspelled Harry
Krejsa '10s name.

- The caption for last week’s story on Ultimate Frisbee gave
the incorrect class year for Brigitte Anthony ’08.
~ The caption for the 9/7 photo of a women's soccer game

mistakenly identified the Grinnell player in the photo. Pic-
tured was #14 Ellie Deal ’11.

from p. 1
tional.” She also said that more than half the applicants were
asked to come in for interviews.

One applicant who was not asked for an interview was Nick
Blencowe ’08, who applied for All Campus Events (ACE) cor
ordinator. Blencowe served as SGA administrative coordinator
(AC) for the 200672007 school year and had run for vice presi-
dent of Student Affairs against Koszewski.

Blencowe. who said that he does not “begrudge [SGA] in
any way” for their decision, said that Goering told him "she
was pretty unhappy with the content" ofhis application, which
Blencowe found surprising.

“To some degrcc ifyou don’t want [someone on cabinet],
don’t put them on," Blencowe said. “I would rather have them
say, ‘I don't want you on."’

’1‘.J.Hawley’10 was ultimately chosen for the position. She
had applied tor administrative coordinator and had also ex—
pressed interest in ACE on her application. Hawley had served
on ACE in the past and said she was not surprised to be chosen
for the ACE position “because that was something on my ap-
plicarion."

“lfit had said ‘concerts chair,’ that would have raised some
eyebrows," Hawley said. “It wasn't something that seemed off
or odd to me."

Kirby Ramstad ’08'5 application process was also more
complicated than most. Ramstad, who was chosen for student
services coordinator, had applied while she was abroad in India,
and said that power failures and travel had left her unable to
reply to an interview questionnaire by e~mail. When Ramstads
application did not arrive by the deadline, SGA executives cons
tactcd Ramstad's girlfriend, Liz Carrier '07, for a proxy inter-
v-iew.

Ramstad said that she felt that applying from abroad gave
her no iinfair advantages in the process. “Ifanything, I think it’s
a detriment to me," she said.

Despite this detriment, Ramstad was chosen. She said that
she was not surprised by this outcome. “I was quite confident in
my application," said Ramstad.

The choice of films chair was also complicated. Previous
chair Jeff Sinick '09 was accepted for another year, but then
decided to go offcampus for the fall semester. (Sinick later re»
turned to campus.) Following this, applications were reopened.
Ultimately, Anand Balasubrahmanyan ’08 was chosen to be
films chair for the fall semester.

Members of cabinet and the executives strongly insist that
they chose the best applicants available.

“Judging every applicant on the basis ofrheir application
was hard," said Koszewski. “There was a lot of back and forth
on basically all the applications."

“I think there were many right choices," Goering said. “We
would have been hardrpressed to make a wrong choice.”
