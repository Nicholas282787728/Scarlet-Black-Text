straited a violation of SGA bylaws. Election Board convened
the next day to assess the validity ofthe charges,

ELECTION BOARD

According to Bishop, Licnemann‘s violations of election
policy would normally result in Olson forfeiting his status as
an ofﬁcial candidate; he would still be able to participate in the
election, but only as a writestn candidate.

But because the election was a runoff, according to SGA
Bylaws, Election Board could not simply remove Olson from
the ballot since doing so would have left Cnrmody as the only
ofﬁcial candidate. Election Board also decided that it could not
legitimately invalidate Olson's candidacy or declare Cnrmody
the winner. “We solicited assistance from past members of
Election Board to see ittlns had happened before,“ said Bishop.
"It had not. We had a constitutional crisis."

After much deliberation, Election Board decided to hold a
second runoffwith Carmody and Lindsay Dennis ’08 as official
candidates while allowing Olson to participate as a write—in.
“The...action was agreed upon by consensus," said Bishop. “No
one on Election Board disagreed with the decision."

Upon hearing these results, Olson appealed Election
Board's decision, which meant Joint Board had to convene an
emergency meeting in 24 hours.

JOINT BOARD

As the meeting beganJoint Board voted to make it a closed
session, but included Election Board members, as well as Cars
mody, Olson, and interested students in the gallery. At the end
of thc scssionJornt Board voted to reopen the session and make
the full minutes public. According to the minutes ofthe session,
Election Board offered senators four options based on whether
or not they believed Olson to have vrolated the constitution and
whether they thought Election Board’s decision should stand.

Only Election Board members were aware of the election
results and Joint Board members on Election Board did not
vote. Those with this dual membership were Bishop, Mirane
da Paley ’09, Harry Krejsa ’10 and Julie Edwards '08. Dennis,
Lienemann, Billups and Blencowe also abstained from voting
because ofconﬂicts of interest.

Olson and Lienemann said they did not know about the
rule, and believed they had respected the intention of the rule,
if not the rule itself. “ityou're going to do a technical reading of
the constitution, yes, I violated it," said Licnemann. “However,
I don't think I violated the spirit of the laws."

According to the Constitution, Election Board must public
cize the election rules,butwhat this means is up for interpretar
tion. “I think it‘s the duty of Election Board to make available
the rules ofelections," said Bishop. “But I feel it's the responsi-
bility of candidates to inform themselves."

Billups had a different take. “[Election Board should offer
a bullet point breakdown of the rules," he said. “Technically,

Election Board is to publicize the documcnt."

Some took issue with the rule itself. believing it to limit
speech. “On an individual level, we should never try to stop
people from expressing preference,"said Olson. “There’s a line
between the office and the individual holding the office."

After much debate and several strawVpoll votes,]oint Board
senators voted to support “Option D" which declared that
Olson had violated the constitution, but that the rule he had
violated was unfair. “Option D" involved enacting the elastic
clause, which allows Joint Board to temporarily suspend por—
tions of the Constitution. By enacting the elastic clause,]oinr
Board could suspend Article III Section I of the bylaws which
had been violated.

Only the president or vicespresident can move to enact
the clause, and since SGA President Chris Hall ’07 was out of
town for thc wcelcend, Billups was the only person who could
do so. Ultimately, Billups approvcd the motion for the elastic
clause and while the support of foursfifths oroint Board was
required, the motion was passed unanimously

No SGA member who was aware ot’the election results was
allowed to vote. Senators Nate Lindsey’09, Rachel Osborne'07
and Suzanne Polivy’08 wcrc not present at the meeting and did
not participate in the vote. Senator Allison Amphlett ’08 left
the meeting early and also did notvote.

While some members expressed reservations about enacting
the elastic clause, they believed it was the best option available.
East Senator Mike Kober ’10 said, “The most important thing
is we thought people would be very upset about the election
being thrown out, that it didn't count for anything.”

some members expressed dislike of the rule, and hoped
to later rewrite it. “Finding that V'PAA-Elect Olson had not
solicited a senator truly would have been an act otcronyism,"
Jamaland Senator Zach Razavi '08 said by email. “Instead, our
decision to suspend the clause and reveal the votes which we
unanimously agreed were unspoiled by the solicitation should
reﬂect our belief that the bylaw was well-intentioned but poorly
worded and in need ofreform."

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Because ofBillups’ endorsement of Olson, he was in a diffi—
cult position. “In hindsight.1 probably wouldn’t have [endorsed
Olson]," said Billups.“I guess on principle [1 shouldn'thave1."

Vice President of Student Affairsselect (VPSA) and
Loosehead senatorJan Koszewski ’08 agreed that the simation
was complicated. “[Billups’] endorsement was, to be quite hon~
est, out of place," he said. “He was well aware of the awkward
place in which he was caught."

While others were displeased by Billups’situation, no one at
the meeting felt the conﬂict of interest was signiﬁcant enough
to prevent the motion. "1 think [the endorsement] was a con-
ﬂict ofintercst and a double standard,"Lienemann said. “Burl
think he did what Chris [Hall] would have done."

“I’ve said before and maintain that ifit happened the other
way around, 1 would have done the same thing," said Billups.
"I acted in the most principled manner] could 1 feel like my
personal relationship didn't come into play."

Billups was not the only one whosc participation was quesr
tioned. Bcforc discussion began. Joint Board members agreed
that due to potential conﬂicts of interest, senators Lienemann
and Dennis, as well as those senators serving on Election Board,
were barred from voting. only two members of cabinet, Mi-
chael Van Hull: '07 and Karly Newton ’07 were considered far
enough removed from the situation to vote.

Some of those not voting did not think the clause should
have been enacted. Blencowe, who abstained because, as a for»
mer member of Election Board, he had advised the Board on
the situation, was vehement in his opposition to use ofthe elas-
tic clause. “1 don't think it was appropriate for them to use the
elastic clause to exonerate people that should have known bete
ter," he said. “What we saw is essentially [SGA] doing favors
and fucking with our constitution when we shouldn’t have."

Blencowe also thought this use ofthe elastic clause set a bad
precedent. “I understand the reasoning on [invoking the elastic
clause},”he said. "But I think this is a bad time to start picking
and choosing what miles We follow."

Because so many people abstained, some took issue With
Koszewski's decision to vote in the matter. “As someone who
had just been elected to be either Eric or my counterpart, for
him to be making decisions to allow even the slightest advan-
tage for one ofus seems to be a huge conﬂict of interest,"said
Carmody Koszewski said in hindsight, he wished he had abs
stained. “I tried to keep my participation at a minimum," he
said. “I felt I had a duty as an active senator [to vote].”

Billups said he would have abstained had he been in Kosze-
wski’s situation “in light of the fact that you’ve got a whole oth-
er six weeks as vicceprcsidcnr-elccr to build relationships'rhis
really sets the tone for your whole vicerpresidency, whether or
not you’re going to act in a principled manner."

Koszowskl and Olson will join Megan Goering ’08 as next
year's SGA Executive, but some are still pondering the election.
“I still have doubts [about the decision] ," said Billups.“I feel for
public officials who have to make those decisions that can be
seen as overly political.You do the best you can at the time."

Hall agreed. “I really wish that I would have been there
at Joint Board to share the burden of making a decision with
them," he said. “I think they handled it to the best of their abili-
ties at the moment.”

SGA members interviewed agreed that the clauses in ques
tion would have to be revisited to avoid similar situations in
the future. The responsibility for evaluating the rules will fall
to SGA’s Reform Committee, which is currently assessing the
SGA Constitution line by line. If nothing else, the election has
sparked student interest.The first Reform Committee meeting
following the election was, said Bishop, “very well attended."

Despite the CD05
efforts, students may con-
tinue to not use the center due to time con,
straints. Anderson said he was “going to apply
for an internship this time around, but then
the semester was really hard and I didn't have
time."

With students already trying to balance
demanding academic and extracurriculai ice
spons' ‘lities, other concerns, such asjobs and
internships, sometimes rakc a lower priority,

But an early deadline may, in fact, be the
biggest reason many Grinnellians did not 3}),
ply for internship grants for the coming sum
mer.

Because a student must have been accepted
to an internship site prior to the April 4 dead-
line, some students were ineligible to apply for
a grant. Many sites do not send acceptances
until May.

According to Cllulklns, the early deadline
is necessary because "many internship sires
want to know as soon as possible iftlaoy have
someone to accept their positions."
