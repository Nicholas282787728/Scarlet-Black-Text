Returning to Zimbabwe with hope and disappointment

Walking the streets of Harare, Zimbabwe
during last summer I couldrrt help but rcel a
sense of pride. Three years had passed since
I had left the city and unlike in rhe past, the
streets of Harare were new clean, Gone were
the irritating vendols and their concomitant
beggars and even the fountain in the central
business district was now working. school-
children in u rm passed by and imported
SUVs drove by. I felt that rhe city authorities
had done a good job clearing off the undesirr
ables,who had turned the city into a bastion of
all that eould bcwr-ong r a city. Had 1 been
a black nationalist from Ameriea champion-
ing black advancement or a foreign Journale
rat on a governtiieiit~managed tour ofthe city.
concluding that all was normal in Zimbabwe
would have come to me naturally.

but after a closer analysis, this aura ofnor-
maley soon vanished, to be replaced by the
grim reality that the average worker experit
enced every day. The agriish-eloiided faces of
the workers 1 saw rold a story of a country in
decline, a country with no hope for recovery

In under a decade, workers had seen the
GDP shrtnk to about three billion USD, the
unemployment rate seal to 80 peicent, exports
decline from to Just uiidcr 1.81) USD. alld
theirlifc expectancy decline [0 41 for men and
38 for women, About 4 million of then col—

leagues had fled the country. inflation had gals
loped to almost 1700 percent, the highest in
the world. The public health delivery system
is incapable of treating people when they are
ill, their children are hungry because they can’r
feed rhem since the price of goods increases
every dayThe few children who had managed
to go to the college were back at home, their
dormitory tear-gassed by riot police.

While the workers were struggling to make
ends meet, in the corridors of powei it was
business as usual. President Robelt blugabe’s
government was busy hatching straregics to
prolong its stay in power through the cnactr
merit of repressive laws that have eroded the
woikers constitutionilly guaranteed right to
freedom of speech and association. Brandish-
iiig draconian laws like the Public Order and
Security Act (POSA) and the A ss to Infor»
matron and Protection of Privacy Aer (AlPr
PA), the state security apparatus had tortured,
beaten, imprisoned and dragged the workers
to court every time they had attempted to c
press their anger through peaceful street pio-
tests,

Few had come to the aid of the workers,
Although images ofwoikcrs being beaten by
the police had ciiculated across the world, none
of the progressive governments in southern
Africa had stepped forward to help, reluctant

to criticize Mugabe’s government. Given that

the workers helped extinguish the apartheid

flame, rhc citizens of Zimbabwe initially be

lievcd that the government oleiabo Mbcki in

South Africa would come to their rescueTlie

old repressive regime ofIan Smith (the colo-

nial ruler) acquiesced to black popular majori-

ty rule when the South Africans threatened to

sever all supplics to landlocked Zimbabwe.
on the contrary,

the current South

African govern-

ment has not raised

a finger in proresr

ofMugibc’s human

rights abuses or his

haiassment of the

judiciary.

Instead, the South Afiican government has
preached sermons like “Zimbabweans should
solve their ploblems," desprtc the presence of
repressive laws. Mbcki forgets that apartheid
in South Africa was vanquished with help
from abroad

Apologists for Mugabe like Mbeki are
fond of tpiotrng figures showing an increase
in the number of schools and hospitals since
he came to power in 1930, A recent rssric of
Th» Emily/1m! even dared to praise Mugabe,
portraying hurt as someone who has done

more good than harm to the country As its
evidence, it cited the presence of SCl’iOOlClHl'
dren in neat uniforms going to school in the
stleets ofi-Iarare.

What these apologists fail to comprehend
is that although the number of schools and
hospitals has increased, they are understaffed,
devoid of furniture, and undersuplied. The
question is which is better: 10 schools with
no teachers, where
students sit on the
floor,or two schools
with teachers and
adequate supplies?
Even those in gov
ernment know very
well that they have
killed the education system ofthe country and
heiice send their children to school in the US,
and Britain,

Time is the only solacc for many workers.
They know that Mugabe is the source of all
their woes and that he is 83 years old.Thcre is
a strong beliefon the streets in Haiare that the
old lnaii will die, soon followed by the delivei-
alice onilnbabwc from evil. 1T he Archbishop
of Euliwavo, the second largest city in the
country, was quoted by the mcdia urging all
the people of Zimbabwe to pray fol the death
ofMilgabe. we can only hope rt comes soon.

Guest Column

Using involvement and politics to heal from tragedy

forces...

and so on.

During a week like this one, a columnist’s job is hard. Do 1
continue on with the normal themes ofmv column, pietending
like nothing happened,> Is there really anything I ean say thats
going to make things better? I doubt it, but I will try anyway:

Confronted by tragedies, differ-
ent people look in different places
for comfort, for hope, or even for
answers to The Big Questions.
Whether it's religion, solitude, a
great book, mindless primevtime
television, family, or friends, we all
need to do what’s necessary to cope.
But ordeals like these have a tendency to make us feel power-
less, and that feeling is scary,

In times like these, I don’t want to be cynical anymore, I
don't want to be cynical about life and, in particular, about polir
tics. 1 want to believe that America is ready for “Big, Bold,
Transformational Change," as Presidential candidate John Ed-
wards so strongly claims. 1 optimistically recall John McCain's
belief that “Our political differences, no matter how sharply
they are debated, are really quite narrow in comparison to the

remarkably durable national consensus on our founding convicr
tions." I keep telling myselfthat our society can improve itself
7 that things are getting better all the time.

I want to feel hopeful for the funire when I hear John Kerry
call for a revolution in our country's
mental health system by providing
“full mental health parity once and
for all” in public and private health
insurance. Something drives me to
believe that more sensible handgun
policies or more effective public
safety programs might be enacted
to prevent future tragedies like the shootings at Virginia'l‘eeh.

And even in the face ofunlikely odds, l cling to the ldeal~
istic notion that, any day now, the world and America’s policies
towards it might become more compassionate: that our occur
pation of Iraq will someday end, that peace in that region is
possible, that fewer people around the world and cven in our
own country might starve every day, that fewer will suffer from
curable illnesses for lack of adcquate care, that fewer will have
to live in fear of terrorists, their own governments, or occupying

'07

But at my core, what I most want to believe 7 w/mZI need
to tit-lime that by getting involved in our communities and
our government, we can make a difference. Whether it’s true
or not, its all Ive got.

No one who claims to know how to fur all that is wrong in
the world' is telling the truth, and we shouldiit fool ourselves
into thinking that every tragedy is preventable But dwelling
on questions of “what we could have done" or "what others
should have tried" is less healthy rhan looking towards the fu-
ture: “What can we do now to improve life for ourselves and
for others?”

Trite sayings about turning lemons to lemonade and the
like seem to ring hollow right now, but the underlying message
is worth thinking about. When you're ready ro feel empowered
again, consider getting involved in a cause that you believe in
r orjust something that you man! to believe in.

For me, at least, the feeling that I am actually doing rot/me
lbing— however fleeting that feeling rnrghtbe — provides a pro-
found and deep sense ofcomfort that I haven‘t found anywhere

Abroad, confronting inner dilemmas and xenophobia

Ltired by the prospect of .i ninerdollat
flight. during a week~long break from our pro
gram iii swedeir,Chris humor; and i decided
to visit Maiseille, France's secoudrlargesr city.

On. first day there was marked by a terse
interaction. While I was photographing a
brook ichr having wandered away a
gentleman passing by me stopped and ms
quirod something in French. Aftcr stuttering
"Je ne parle pas fiarrcars," he briefly welcomed
me to his city (in English) and admonished
me to be careful. all in the same breath. Mart
settle, like any major city, has its troubles and
as a female traveler I am used to, and tired of,
such warnings.

That admonislnncnt i-esouiitletl in my ears
the next morning when a transieiit~looking
man shouted uncndingly at me as I crossed a
street. Having approached lrrrn from hehind,l

cd richly brown dirt eaked in the creases
ofliis neck, his matted hair and unidentifiable
blotches on his faded green sweatshirt Smells
ing slightly stale as I walked past,I re' ed the
angry rant coming from his mouth was not in
French and directed at me,

At first, I refused to allow my unease about
the shouting to dampen my spirits. I awoke
eaily with the intentions ofsccuring a croisr
sant and ofrhcn walking down to Fort saints
Jean and watching the sun rise from there in
solitude.

Shaking off any discomfort, I continued

on my stroll towards the Fort when this man
appeared again. I had been walking somewhat
slowly so it was possible for him to have passed
me without me noticing and done an about-
l: That was the only wiry he could have been
behind me minutes earlier bur now walking
towaltls me. When this occurred two more
times in the next is minutes, I began to feel as
though i were being circled by a buzzard

Prior to this visit, I read that bliiiscille IS
troubled by in irnnugiant population tl'
not rich integrated with its society. compi-
ing sir percent of the population, 1? ncc's imr
migrant groups eome mostly from North Afr
lien and the Middle E11<r,PCl'\’fiSl\’C mama and
xenophobia are barriers to social cohesion in
general, anrl this is also true in alaiseille.

Other potential barriers are religious dit:
l’crcnccs and the connectedne. to “home" i’i
internet and satellite TV. In France, the interns
ployrnent rate among male immigrants is 20
percent, two times as high as that of the na—
tive-horn population, Despite only being . ‘<
percent othaucc's total poprrlarron, 2e percent
ofthe country's prisoners are immigrants.

Based on his daikcr-tliaiirFtench skin color
and unidentifiable language, the man circling
me could have been Nor-iii African Having
studied and witnessed first hand what can hapr
pen when people are disconnected from their
old communities and not fully integrated in
rheir new ones, I became especially wary of

him. It is when aiiomie sets in that there is
an lnciease in clinic, destructive behavior, and
often iiolence because auomic individuals no
longer adhere to social lestiiunts.

With all of this in mind I contemplated
the man who ap-
peared to he circling
inc. I became painfully
aware that the way l
was dressed and my
deportnrenr identified
me as a very alone, f
male, Ameiican tiav—
eler (Europeans can spot Amctic us from 1.5
kilometers away).

All inwaid bittlc ensued I was aivrile oftl lic
unfairness ofnlv lineal 1001C. He looked honic-
less and non native Probably unemployed
and lionielessi'l‘lii probably meant he rot
well integrated into French society iAlienr
atloti can lead to anomic behavioriAnomic
behavior is a thieat to me

i he independent part ofine assured myself
cveiything would be fine. I knew the niimbel
for the pol ice, Chris would be wolried ifI did
not return from my walk, and that my desire
to see the sunrise should supercede any silly,
paranoid thoughts I was having. Did I actually
feel threatened? or was 1 automatically assunr
irrg an rinslravcn, unwashed, lrornclessrlookrng
man who “looked like an ittimigrant"rlwulri be
a threat based on what I had read about the

city Perhaps he was a traveler like me but her
cause I am a white woman in a white countiy
I was privileged to not have anyone suspect 'I
did not belong Shouldlit I be fiir aiid stop
being suspicious ofhim:
the pragmatic side
of me recalled those
warnings from my
travel guides. the other
strange man who had
cautioned me a day
earlier about being
careful, and the special
pamphlet given only to women by Grinnclls
Studv Abroad oliicc waining us of the daiir
geis of tiavcling alonc. My priiriouslyv negative
experiences with be’ g followed by white men
AND men of color, "gentlemen" or not, were
also surfacing,

A growing pit of unease was developing in
mi’ stomach fiom the stress ofbeiiig followed
and my attempts to reconcile thoughts I was
frustrated to be haying

When the man in question appeared be
fore me for the fourth time,I decided it was
time in make a decision about my morn-
ing. Feeling defeated, disheartened, and ur-
terly disappointed in myself,l nrrned around,
walked back into the lieait ofthe city and had
my morning ct ant and cafe’ au lait in a
crowded brasserie.

What would you have done?
