From the outside, 1027 Elm St. looks like
a typical college housc.The exterior is deteritr
rating, couches and lawn chairs cover most of
the front porch and bikes are parked against
the side of the house. But upon entering the
front door oprt 3, it becomes clear that the
$lum is no ordinary student house.

The walls are plastered with a hodgepodge
ofvarious items, including signs, grllﬂltl, postr
ers (several of Steve Pretontarne), photos of
semirnudc runners, track spikes, trophies, ar-
rest records and almost anything else that can
hang on a wall. “We didn’t put any ofthis stuff
up," Charlie Knuth ’08 said. “It came with the
house."

Knuth, along wirh Ben Raphelson, Davc
Kris! and Conor McGee, all class of ’08,are the
tenants ofthc $lum this year. Knuth and Krist
presently run on the crossrcountry team and_
Raphelson has ran in cars past, but Mchc
b has no formal
association
with the team.
Instead, his
connection to
the other resir
dents is that

Knuth during

their rrrsr year,

The shun was first occupied by runners in
the 198586 school year and, savc one year, has
been occupied by a group of runners (and ac—
casronally an outsidcr or two) sirlcc.The slum
(originally just the “Slum”) received its name
from an alum visiting the house in the mid to
late’sos. “It got rhc dollar sign when it became
capitalist," Raplielson said, He estimates that
this took place about six or seven years ago.

The residents said that one of purposes
of the Slum is to preserve the team’s history,
describing themselves as “curators more than
tenants." But its purposes also
extend beyond historical pres-
ervation. Raphclson said, “We
just make sure dudes have a
place to rock out and beer to
drink"

Thirryrracks ﬁlled with
empty cans of Pabst Blue Rib—
bon, Natural Ice and Old Milwaukee line the
wall of the dining/recycling room. “we prob—
ably play more moose in here than we actually
eat," Raphelson said.

Th lum hosts parries and several orhr
er act s every week. For instance, every
Thursday is movie night in which people come
over, drink forties and watch a movie. Possibly
to the surprise of some, the slum also hosts

pours and

grandmother’s house.”

a bible study on Wednesday nights. Although
that doesn't mean Wednesdays are quiet at the
$lum, as Knuth said people generally venture
over to the Pub afterwards.

Two of the biggest $lum parties are Whis—
key Weekend and Green Weasel. Green Wea—
sel is the weekend of the Dick Young Classic
and Whiskey Weekend is held around the Les
Duke Invite and attracts many alumni, who
come back for the weekend.

Some favorite tunes at parties include
“Roxanne,““Cum on Feel the Noize" and any
Guns N' Roses song. At the end of a $lum
'party when the alcohol supply has run dry, all
ofthc party»goers circle up in the Party Room
with their arms around each other and sing
BillyJoel's “Piano Man."

Both Raphelson and Knuth accuse the
swim team of coroptlng the “Piano Man"
tradition from the runners. “I hate the swim
team," Raphclson said.

“Swimmel House is like my grandmother’s
house,” Knuth added.

Raplielson said the $lum has so many par
ties and events going on all the time people are
often surprised when they come over and there
is not a party. "People live hetc,"he said.

“People sleep here, they don’t really live
here," Knuth added.

Over the years, rhc runners have not al-
ways been kind to the $lum and the Slum is
not always kind to rlrcm in returnThc “Party
Room"—a room in which people dance and
thrash during partiesillas several holes in the
ceiling from people punching through ltwhile
dancing on the couches.

The wooden stairs- arc rotting and “eteak
with every step as a result otdozens ofdrink-
rng games called “vertical pour-s." In a vertical
pour, a beer is poured into a tunnel and ﬂows
through thin plastic piping until it is released
about six feet above the head of a person
sprawled out on the stairs. The majority of
the beer does not make it into
the person’s mouth; instead the
stairs, as well as the person’s
clothes, absorb most of it.

The damage does not end
with vertical poursr Raphclson
also plays a game in which he
lights a bottle rocket on the
stove in the kitchen, runs through the dining
room and tries to make it to the stairs before
the bottle rocker sets off.

The house does not seem passive towards
these actions though, reciprocating unkind be-
havior back to the residents. Recently, a large
chunk of ceiling, unrelated to rhe punched-
through ceiling, tell and struck Knuth. “I was
walking out ofthe bathroom and then a light

ning bolt struck and it fell,” Knuth said.

The door to Raphelson’s bedroom was not
closing early in the year. He assumed it was
the humidity until the door fell off the hinge
one day. “You don't so much live here as wage
a (glistant battle against the Slum,”Raphelson
sat .

When asked about the worst part of liv-
ing in the $lum, residents complained about

the mess, the ﬂies and having to pay an extra
month’s rent since they acknowledge they will
lose their damage deposit. McGee said only,
“Runners."

When asked about the best part. there was
a period of silence and the residents looked
around deferring to each other. After the pause,
Raphelson said,“Knowing that you've hit bot—
tom and there is nowhere to go but up."
