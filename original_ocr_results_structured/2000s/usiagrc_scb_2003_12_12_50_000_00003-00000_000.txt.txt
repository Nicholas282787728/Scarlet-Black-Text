No more dining music

”I was born here in Iowa and was raised on
holiday and Christmas music," said Lyle Barman,
supervisor ofCoivles Dining Hall, referring to the
music that has recently filled Cowles at mealtime.
But following complaints from students, Dick
Williams, the director ofCrinncll dining services,
decided to eliminate the music, prompting debate
over the decisio .

Baurnan disagreed with she new policy. The
practice ofplaying musicwas a new concept added
to the dining halls, Bauman said, “to bringa comfy
and homey" atmosphere to students under “finals
stress" during their meal times. “I think the majorc
ity of the students are in favor of us playing the
music," Bauman said.

However, not all students appreciated the ges-
ture. Bauman confirmed dratastudent or two went
to Williams and raised a complaint to the effect
that “we don’t want music in the dining halls."
According to baurnan, the reason given was that
the “music goes againrr our religions” The direc.
tor rhcn proceeded to shutdown the music. a dctir
sion that some students disagreed with

The dining hall is public space, said Nii A
Cogo 07. You canrgo intoarestaurant and tell
them to stop playing music because ir goes against
your religion"

“It is very unfortunate that the majority ofstu»
dense are losing out to the minority." said bauman,
Bauman pointed out that the dining hall workers
are also disappointed. “We spend eight hours here
working and we like to hear the music playing and

.. it is surprising that some students don’t appre—
ciate that," Bauman said. “That doesn't mean we
don't respect their religion."

Grinnell College has undergone many changes
in the past academic year. The new East Campus
dorms, a larger student body, the suicides of last
spring and continuing concerns about tuition. ﬂ»
nancinl aid and faculiy salaries have raised many
challenges for the colleges budget ofapproxirnately
$64 million. Meeting them in a way that satisﬁes
the needs ofstudcnrs, staff, Faculty and trustees is
difﬁcult, but not untenabic. Financial goals for the
next two years include an ongoing commitment
to needvbiind admissions, providing better {inane
cial aid packages. funding mental health, raising
faculty salaries and paying for new buildings and
lciiovarlolls. The question is, how will Funds be
allocated to each priority.>

Budget steering committee

The group responsible for allocating all bird.
gets, including tuition, financial aid and depart.
ruentai budgets, is Griniiell College's Budget steer.
ing Committee. The committee has 15 members,
including the president, the chair of rho faculty,
and the academic dcans. The only student meme
ber oftlre committee is student government trees
srrteriacob Kaufman-Osbornn/i. BMIcaally. hesaid,
the committee includes "everybodywlio's anybody
and me,"

Kaufman-Osborn said that in the process of
financial planning, “trustees address the long range
issues ofthe college," whereas “students address the
short range issues I try to represent current is-
sues." Kaufmancosbam said drat hereinrs “to make
sure people are at least aware of the short—term"
coliccriisof“cuir:ntstudents." KaufmancOsborn
wants snideiits to approach him to discuss the buds
get, bursard that “students at large don't come and
talk" to him because they are unaware ofhis posi—
tion as a committee mcmbct.

Tuition, grants and scholarships

MargarerToorney, the co«lcadcrofGrinncllians
for Economic and Social Diversity (GESD), had
many unanswered questions about the uses of
Grinnell College's budget. Toomey noticed a lack
ofstudent knowledge about how the administra-
rive policy of recruitment ofstudenrs who could
pay full tuition would affect the student body. “of.
ficially GESD hasn’t really looked at that as part of
our group prerogative,” Toomey said “within the
group members have expressed concern about [the
budget for financial aid], but we feel that the col-
lege isn’t giving us enough information to make a
iudgmcnt.”

Jonathan Brand, vice president ofinstitutional
and Budget Planning, said that Grinnell College’s
budget for grants and sdiol.
arships would irot decrease

we're giving it to students who have the greatest

to decrease, Each ycar that we'vc [2]de about
trying to generate more tuition revenue, the ﬁnan-
cial aid pool has still gone up by a significant

Tom Cnidy, Vic: prcsidcnt for Student Affairs,
said that this year “there is a $400,000 ovemgc in
financial aid." Crady said that during the 2004 to
2005 school ymr, “we have proposed an increase of
approximately $1.7 million" in ﬁnancial aid. “This
proposed increase will include the overagc from this
year which rattles forward for the next three ymrs,”

iim Sumner, the dean ofAdmissions and Fr
nancial Aid discussed a resolution by trustees ro
reerriit more full paying students in order to iris
crease tuition revenue, “The resolution that the
trustees passed in May ofzool was the result ofa
committee ofsrudenrs, trustees and administrators.
The lead point was rhar we will remain nerd
blind and we will continue to meet loo percent or
the need of the admitted students. .,.'rhat's one of
the reasons thatI came [to Grinneill. And i have
every reason to believe itwiil continue."

Sumner said that of more than 5,500 colleges
in corinrry, fewer than 40 give need blind admiSs
sion and meet full need ofstudents. “I think wc’d
like to continue to be in that small caregory," he
said,

Sumner stressed that "that resolution has not
had a mayor impact" on the socioeconomic com
position of the student body. "our student body
continues to be, certainly among the iirost elite
colleges in America, one ofthe inostsocioecoiionii.
cully diverse. Period," he said. “lfwc were to have
a more socioccconomimlly diverse student body,
rhc only way we could do that would be to enroll
more students with more money:-

Although attempts to enroll higher percentages
of full paying students have been unsuccessful.
Sumner believes that the student body could bane
efit from enrollment ofstudents
who do not need financial aid,

Toomey said, "The col»
lege may say that ifwe put in

students but] . .. that may not

Although it is possible
that the money would be spent on other things,
such as buildings or maintenance, sumner thought
that providing better financial aid packages was im»
porrant to the budget steering committee. “1ch

Faculty salaries

“Fach of the last (int: years, that: hzvc been
two really high priorities, which has been the ﬁ.
nancial aid pool and faculty salaries that are eorrr
petitivc with our peers,” said Brand.

Brand explained that in order to attract quali—
ﬁed profssors to Grinncll, salaries must meet or
exucd professor salaries orrcied by comparable col.

compare [Grinnell‘s raculty and staff salaries] to
peers, and we ﬁgure out are we losing ground or
are we gaining ground. we want competitive fnc»
ulty and staffsalaries And on the starrside I think
most would say we're doing a ﬁne job, we're in the
range. with faculty salaries there’s a lor ofevrdence
tosuggest, particularlywith assistant professors that
we're not where we need to be," said Brand.

Mental health

other priorities this year include strident mens
tul health and new campus buildings. Subsequent
to last year's suicides, the budget steering Corns
initiee has “allocated more resources to mental
health, and to the whole range ofservices that we
offer ourstridents," said Brand.

There has been a “$00,000 increme in tonne
se ling services, said Cradv. Walk in counseling
has been averaging 45 hours per week along with

ing use has basiotlly doubled since last year at this

Crady said rhat because ofthc increase in coiln<
seliiig services, this year’s student activity fund of
$30,000 has been eliminated, He stressed that
money allocated to counseling services “docs not

things when necessary,”

New buildings

The new cast urns
pus dome and plans for
renovations will also af-
fect the budget, but
Brand does not know
exactly how. “The buds

always a question of cutting. but its figuring out
how you're going to spend the increased revenue,"
he said. “With these buildings, we’ve got to hear

them clean, which means custodial services, Some»

The financial future

The plan for the budget of die next academic
year is still in the works, according to Grinncll’s
Institutional and Budget planning website. The
Budgetstcerrng committee plans to work on mak—
ing Crinnell College more ﬁnancially attractive to
profcsors. The committee predicts that nestyeat's
budget will includc $3 million of additional rev»
cnuc. This will be used for a ﬁve percent increase
“in die faculty salary pool, an additional $1,000
per assistant professor (totaling approximately
$80,000) and a 3.5 percent increase in the staff
salary pool."The committee also plans to fund "ﬁve
new tenure track faculty positions, four ofwhich
are diversity positions and a term position in Japa-
nest.

Additionally, the committee plans to decrease
reliance on the billion dollar endowment bcczuse,
according to ils website. “in the event ofa sustaincd
downturn in the stock markct, this revenue source
will decline." Consequently, the committee plans
to balance niitiori revenues, gifc and grants against
the cndowmcnt's contribution.

Over all, Brand, Cindy, Sumner and Kaufman
Osborn are pleased with this yar’shudgct. “It seems
like the budget has a pretty natural flow I think
the [budget steering] Committee does a great job
and hopefully they‘ll continu: to do 50," said
Kaufman-Osborn.
