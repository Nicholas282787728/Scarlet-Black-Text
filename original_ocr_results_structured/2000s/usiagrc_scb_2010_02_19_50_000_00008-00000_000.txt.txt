Jacks WIII be missed

Last week Concerned Black Students (CBS) met; with
admission counselors Seth Allen and Doug Badger to discuss
the ﬁring of Chicago recruiter Marlene Jacks. egos and oth-
ers familiar with Jacks tried to convey that she was the only
adult at the college that many smdentsvespecinlly students
of colorwrrusted and with whom they felt a strong relation-
ship Students also spoke about how Jacks was the reason that
theywent not only (0 Grinnell but to any college, Despite
these voices of concern, the office of admission went through
with her employment termination.

The magnitude of student response to her dismissal reveals
that Jacks had a unique ability to connect with the students
she worked with. She not only became active in students lives

during their college application and decision- -making process.

but maintained relationships with students as they adjusted
to college life Having known snidents Earn the beginning of

However, that does not mean that other recruiters cannot

have an equally positive inﬂuence on students lives. We of- ‘

ten think of admisslom as a domain separate from student life,
but Jacks proved the value ofrelatjonsliips that carry over from
wideeeyed prospies to jaded seniors.

Support for GALFA

As growing support 'for rhe local foods movement at
Grinnell becomes gradually more apparent—the local foods

be making a come back as well.

The rcsbirth of the Grinnell Area Local Foods Alliance
(GALFA) is essential not only to Grinnell College but
to the Grinnell community as a whole, since it cone

and farmers interested in supplying and eating lo-
cally grown food .

GALFA has the potential not just to market local foods

Gemﬂttln'g old and forgetting how to live the dream‘

So this one cime in college, on our way to
48 hours of freedom, a friend of mine hit me
with some knowledge.

“You're one ofrhe mosr age conscious peo~
pl: 1 know, Tim" she said, or something to that
effect.

“Well that sucks, I guess" was my retort,
as I began to drift into an internal dialogue
which would later become this very column.

I come here to you all with a concern ad—
dressing matters that are poiendolly ageisrand
parernaliscie in nature. Here I am in my ivory
senior tower of ethical philosophy, trying my
damdest not to sound too cliche as I spit hot
fire about what it takes
to “live the dream.” But I
remember perfectly well TIM
being a loud mouthed
skinny and anxious ﬁrst
year. complaining abour
the unfortunate reality
that it would take some
time before people started to like and respect
me. When it presented itself, I was overly ex-
cited by the prospect of making friends with
people older than I was. Hell, I was pretty
much blown away,

Take for example the regularly occurring
off-campus after party. Many of you Ol‘rtenors
out there probably remember that what is now
Soccer House had a briefjaunt under the ex-
pert tutelage of some dirty and abrasive senior
type folk, not unlike what I envision my own
friends to be. At least, that's where I know I
draw my own senior image inspiration fromi
the ﬂannel and beards and penchant for loudly
played oldies that typified my ﬁrst-year mish-
es like Ben Weyl and John Guittar to nnme a
few, Man, I thought all those seniors were plit

together, that they were just partying nonestop,
reading important books, doing cool stuﬂ" and
more or less living the dream.

But here I am three years later in their
worn out Nikes and feel none of that magic
which I imagined them to have.Wlis it alljust
a dream to begin with, or did i miss somerhing
along the way? I also bet that I’m not the only
one here in senior Land without any of those
super powers. Now I bet you others might be
wondering like me—was that dream living
even really what we all thought it was cracked
up to be?

What is more, the problemthat we are
now facing
is what to do

HEDERMAN ’10 with those
m e m o r l c 5
now that we
ourselves are
seniors. How
am I supposed
to deal with knowing that it’s perfectly posr
sible that any first year I’m talking to might be
thinking um I have it all figured out. Because
I deﬁnitely don’t. But at the same time, isn’t
there a lot that we've learned in three years
that sets us apart from students who have only
jiist started this ‘bogus journey"? How about
your secondryeers. even you guys must feel like
those awkumrd Nso pods are part ofrbe dise
tant past?

lt' is my contention that there are several
psychic dimensions that go into tiny given
inter yenr communicatory act. Usually alcohol
helps to level out the chaotic EQof this pro~
vcrbial Jam session, but like a great philosopher
once said, “You always sober up." So let's run
through a few. For example, at any momenr

DREAM

of my talking to someone younger than me, I
might possibly consider:

1. What does this person think about me and
my being a senior and how does that texture
our conversation?

2. What did i think when 1 ms his or her age
and how would have that affected me in such
a scenario? .

3. Does this person think about me in any way
similar to the way I thought about seniors at
his or her age, or is he or she way out in left
ﬁeld?

4. What do I cvcn think about myself as a son
niar in reference to what I thought about sc-
niors when l was his or her age and how does
that effect my relating to this individual?

5, How do I delicately navigate the vast ocean
of possibilities that lie between these two poles
in order to minimize alienation and maximize
connection? _

6. Wait, what were we talking about?

Here’s the short end of what I’m strug-
gling with—«is there a my to avoid reifying
ageismithe privileging of one age group as
a better, more knowledgeable, more valuable,
etc.~w‘lthout throwing out all that I think
there is (0 be gained from having seniors drop
their knowledge on first years? Because in
a wily, seniors must have some stuff on lock
down, at least as much n5 anyone can when he
or she has mastered the art of using the Lise
toning Room as a encyclopedia of procrastie
narion or generated unique ways ofsmuggling
exquisite sandwich crcnrions ollt of thc D—hall
(Yenh, I ‘carc to eat’ this sandwich wherever I
damn well please.)

But ar the same runs, its downnghr illogie
cal to punish younger students for not having
been through a college experience thar has

just begun. Certainly we seniors aren't so es
tablished to be beyond the likes of partying
with younger students, or even the occasional
hookup. How can we fairly delegate the value
ofstudent experiences based on accumulated
knowledge without hailing kids by their year
within a discourse in which we supposedly
value difference as much as wisdom? '

Where this discussion brings us to is the
question ofwho it is to whom Grinnell culture
belongs. Well, obvi it’s not just seniors who get
to say what’s what, but it's also the role of the
under-classmen to receive some “The Giver"
type gifts that get passed on through the ages.
But how do you say, “Hey you, you're unique
and importanr to Grinnell” while still letting
people know that die stresses of deciding a
major, making new friends or going abroad are
all common, if not entirely anticipated prob-
lems?

The goal obviously isnt to trivialize the
experiences that end up being shared by most
students, but instead to let everyone know that
there was a Grinnell here before them that
merits communicating. No, seniors aren‘t put
together, but they do have great stories about
the time before you were barmThere’s some
thing so be learned from Grinnell's past. and
that’s what I’m going ro assume that most sui-
derlts are committed to believing in.

- -So, with that daunting list of conversa-
tional possibilities aside, maybe my next move
is to recall those first year memories which I
cherish so much and actually ask a first year
wlicther he or she would like to hear them or
not. Either my I’d hope wed learn something
about Grinnell, or atleust just oliiselves May
be then wed be living the dream

Not satisﬁed, deal with it.
