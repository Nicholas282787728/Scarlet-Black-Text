Who will win this week’s Grinnell tickle city award?

Andrew Walsh ’09 asks the big question: who or what has been the most ticklish in Grinnell this week?

Grinnell is a place hill ofincrediblyticklish things. By that,
I obviously mean things that are amusing, exciting, pleasing,
enchanting, In casual conversation, groups of Grinnell stuc
dents have even been known to bestow the honor of“tickle
city“ on the most extraordinary. Starting today, I‘ll be per-
forming an exhaustive ongoing scorch for ticklislineSs in all
the nooks and crannies of Grinnell, selecting the most im-
pressive and reporting about them here.

But what can win the Grinncll Tickle City Award, you
ask? In short, just about anything.
It could be a student band that puts
on a ticklish show or a spectacular
play in rntramural flag football. it
might be an unlikely study spot
wheie some students get their most
ticklish work done. It could even be
a student who puts away 20 cod nuggets at lrrrrch or earns the
first ever frce spenccr Grill parrinr after pulchiising ten with
their sandwich card. or a heroic campus brke that just won't
grvc up even after losing both handlebars

Most often it is these little things that combine to make
Giinnell a rruly trcklrsh place, Each week I will focus on one
or two of them and explain why I've chosen them for the

A thank»you note to the Crinnell community

This past Saturday, SEptember 4, my dad, Mike Mallberg
was doing what he loved best: offrciating football. This Sate
urday he was at Grinnell College, a school he’s visited many
times, a place my famrly has enjoyed watching hnn “work” his
second job.

This game ended early for my dad. Near
the end of the first quarter, he collapsed on

mediately and a local physician joined them

at they began resuscitative measures. The

Griniiell team, coaching staff and athletic

department stood by, assisting as needed. My father was revived
after three minutes of CPR, and became alert and conversing.
After being assessed and stabilized at the Grinnell hospital, he
was transferred to Methodist Hospital in Des Moines by the
same EMS team from the field.

After a scary frrst 24 hours in the ICU, my dad is doing well.
He has stabilized and is awaiting his aortic valve replacement

1 am writing on behalf of my family: my parents, my sister
and our husbands and children, to thank the communities of
Grinnell and Grinnell College

Speciﬁcally, we would like to thank A.D. Greg Wallace,
Coach Max Hawsey, their staff and teamr coach Wallace bcgan

college has always been a class act in my father's opinion.

The ER staff at Grinnell Hospital cared for my father and
informed my mother of his status We’re grateful to the nurse
who broke the news to my mom of the situation and assured
her ofDad's condition.

Our deepest gratitude goes out to the EMS frrst respondr

The dangerous implications

1 am neither a student nor Grinnell Staff; instead I am a
factory worker who recently read your “Two views in the Line
eral Arts.”I saw words such as “critical thinkingtand “personal
responsibility” and wondered what they meant to other readers
I was curious if it includes ethics and if ethics is discussed in

TICKLE CITY

Grinnell Tickle City Award. it you think someone or some-
thing you know is deserving, don't hesitate to tell [walshand]
wiry. it could even be youl

This week we’ll get going by introducing a couple can-
didates for my next column. the first official Grinnell Tickle
City Award.

Authentic Mexican food, for one, rs strong out ofthc garc
and is presenting a good case why rt may prove to he tickle
city this {all We already know and love Casa Margaritas,
serving up big plates and gigante
margaritas. When the iestaurant
opened back in 2004 complete
with a 12 piece mariachi band, it
satisfrcd a bioticarr craving that
had been drivrng some Grinncll
students mad But like aTV sitcom
in desperate need ofnew characters, the Mexican food market
is looking at an injection ofnew drama this upcoming season,

Two new restaurants, La cabana and Lasfiijltas, comically
situated less than a block fioni each otliei on Main Street,
approach their own grand openings. Tire three restaurants
will fight hard to claim the spotlightWhich will succeed and
which wrll get pushed into the hac ground or dropped entire-

all of your classes (not .is a separate course). Oi does it sound
ridiculous to interrupt calculus with a discussion ofthc ethics
of math (including whose deﬁnition ofethics)?

1 am wondering: Is our ever increasing knowledge resulting
in more ways to kill in higher numbers? Are there more people
in the world than ever before suffering from inadequate food

and water? If so, how could that be with all
our knowledge? is our rncreasing knowl
edge increasing or lessening pollution?

Is the United States truly a democracy
if such a small perccrrragc of the population
votes? Are we rather a market-driven police

state? Aren’t there laws regulating every ac-
tivity of our existence? I heard that the US
prison population is the highest of any country ever, includ
ing China and the former USSR. Is that true?
What are our liberal arts contributing to that?
Do we think that we can create an ideal peace-
ful world through laws and imprisonment? Do
laws on drugs help our populatron? Do thcy
limit the possibilities of investigating altered
states of consciousness? Why does the US in
particular seem to so afraid of mood-altering
drugs? I wonder, has there been an evaluation
to see ifall our knowledge is resulting in im-
proved conditions throughour the world? is
our market driven globalization depriving othe
er cultures of their existence? Are liberal arts
compatible wirh cultures which are focused more on the spirit
or hcing in tum: with the rhythms of the earth? Do our new
technologies result in new ways to attempt to control/alter m,
nrre and subjugate its inhabitants in some beneﬁcial way? Is our
US focus on the materialistic aspects oflife contributing to the
degradatron oflife? Do we take advantage otour affluence and
technology (particularly in weaponry) to control other cultures?
What are we neglecting with all our affluence and liberal arts
education? Do all my questions seem unrelated to each other?

Again, perhaps it seems ridiculous to have an crlucs of
math, but where is ethics discussed? I picked on math because
1 have heard over the years various people say that the laws of
the universe and ofexistencc can be explained through ninth.
Is that true? is there at r? Is it explained by math? is math
untouched by etlrrcs? is ethics discussion done only in a philos
ophy or religious studies class which not everybody wrll take?
Are these questions drscussed when you do a lab experiment or
is it left for some other class to discuss.>

Where is it appropriate to discuss ethics? Why not now?
Why not in your very next class?

How to remember September I] today

Today is the eighth anniversary attire terrorist attacks that
shook both Amerrea and the world. We probably all rememr
ber exactly where we were when the planes hit, but we've been

1y? Will restaurantgoers become flustered and rush to familiar
Taco Bell for bacon cheesy potato burritos? Stay tuned to find
out. Authentic Mexican food—definitely looking ticklish so
far...

Heading back to campus, Phase 2 ofthe Athletic and Fit
ncss Center looks like it's been getting pretty ricklish since we
all left it alone a few months ago, Not to be confused with the
Phase 2 Consignment Shop on 912 Main st, the ncw nata-
torium and freldlrouse are really starting to take shape after
looking like little more than holes in the ground when we
last checked in. According to Grinnell's onlinc update, these
facilities are an integral pan of the liberal arts tradition and
even inspire the human spiiit.

In addition to looking foiward to the SO—metct pool, “1’
door track and tennis courts, student excitement has also been
teaching a fever pitch over the 132-well geothermal freld.
When the project is ﬁnally done in 2010, Gr-inncll is expected
to never losc another l\/Iidwcst Conference rirle rn any sport.
Phase Zilooking pretty ticklrsh so far...

Be sure to check back next time when we'll see who has
won the Grinnell Tickle City Award. And ifyou have a good
idea, be suic to let [walshand] know

Giinnell, you are tickle Cir}!

hearing that since thc day it happened. What I want to know
now is ifthcre even is a way that I am supposed to be reflecting
on such a terrible event. Is there ever a way to do September 11
justice,w‘tthout coming offtis trite or insincere?

While a year or two after each plane crashed in Manhac
ran, virgrnra, and Pennsylvania, the wound may still have felt
fresh for many of us. but has a seemingly openrended war in
the Middle East, with increased casualties by the day, left room
for any potential closure or healrng?The United States military
rnvaded Afghanistan within a few months ofthe September 11
attacks, and continues today in its war on ‘terror’. So how then
do we deal with the responsibility of remembering something
that is so hurtful, even as our nation continues to ride its shock-
wave on missiles and bullets?

I say that we have the responsibility of making sure
that September 11 is remembered in away that
pays respect to the dead, rather than a way that
justiﬁes an endless war ofmilitary and cultural
imperialism. However, with image after image
ofexploding planes crashing into buildings en~
trenched in our hearts, and with an overﬂow
of cultural artifactsifrom blockbuster movies
to a multitude of swngiwe may find ourselves
feeling confused, angry, or even indifferent to
what it ‘really’ means to remember September
11th. What would be the best alternative then,
for reﬂecting on such a well-documented and
commoditized rupture in the fabric ofour nan
tion’s history? Can one choose to compare this tragedy to otl‘r
ers around the worldigenocide, bombings, disasters, famine
and so forth—without disrupting the integrity of America’s
Sense of‘horror at home’? Or would that wrongfully privilege
the Scptcrnber 11 attacks over srmilar violence in Rwanda, su—
dan, Israel/Palestine, and countless other nations torn by war
and hardship in the recent past? While such tragedies do in-
dccd need to be remembered or resolved, putting one in com-
petition with another may prove harmful to the peculiar nature
ofeach individual atrocity. Perhaps then September 11 rightly
belongs to those it hurt, rather than the irresponsible contest
oflisting ‘The World's Greatest Tragedies’ of the last 10 to 15
years.

in trying to remember September 11, the dominant choiccs
for mourning seem to be divided between two poles. Either
there is buying into a prepackaged account of remembering
past harm in order to justify contemporary violencc, or there
is going about business as usual. Bill at not that simple, and
rf you don't know horv to reel, that's ok. There isn't a right
Way to deal with something so terrible. Vl’hat I recommend
is remembering the day and its events in a way that optimizes
healing and understanding, rather than perpetuating anger and
violence. Whether it’s calling your parents, saying a prayer or
starting a conversation with friends, there rsn't one righr or eas ,
answer. However, I am hopeful that there are stcps that o ~
can rake towards a positive future, all the while remembering
“never" to “forget".
