Po'nys almoSt as awesome as opener

Last Friday, the Ponys performance in Gardner Lounge
gave Grinnellians an invigorating start to a well-deserved
weekend. In a time where the pop tones ofLady Gaga reign
supreme on the charts, this band offers a refreshing way for
listeners to get their kicks. Although the vocals aren't much
in the way of a purring soprano and there’s no intensely
throbbing beat, the vibrant garage band sound srlll manages
to energizes listeners just as much as, if not more, than "Bad
Romance.w

Starred in 2001 by guirarist and vocalist Jered Gum-
mere, The Ponys are currently comprised of three other
members—bassist and vocalist Melissa Elias, guitarist Brian
Case, and percussionist Nathan Jerde. Based out ofChicago,
Ill, The Ponys are imbued with a type of indie/punk rock,
relying hea' upo a strong guitar sound and lead singer

Gummere’s strident singing.

During their concert, The Ponys led the listener to a
place of fervenr movement and energy. The majority oftheir
songs are high intensity, and, as I witnessed at the concert,
perfect for the quasi moshing scene going on at the fore»
front of the crowd. You cant help but move your head, tap
your foot or jump up and down excitedly. The kind ofmusic
the Ponys create leads me to reminisce about what garage
bands used to sound likeilively, unedited and fresh.

On their Myspace page, the Ponys cite such things as
“"friends,""hotmbs and whiskey" as inﬂuences asurprising
breath of honesty that differs from other bands who might
feel inclined to cite more elevated and less ordinary sources
ofinspiration. However I think these normal and commons
place inﬂuences are what gave the band a certain “"oomph
factor and made their show so perfect for a Friday night.

Noll-Love, New York

BYTORREYMACGREGOR

Christopher Morley, an American
journalist and essayist, once -said that
New York City was “the nation's thy-
roid gland," According to online medical
sources, the thyroid gland controls how
quickly the resr of the body uses energy,
and how sensitive the body should be
to other hormones. In effect, it helps to
regulate many bodily functions.The mosr
common problems for the thyroid gland
are, on two ends of the spectrum, too
much activity or too lirtle acrivity. And,
just as Morley notes New York City’s
symbolic signiﬁcance in the context of
the nation's collective health and well-
being, he also points ro rhe most common
problems with one of this weekend’s Val-
entine’s Day-themed ﬁlms, “New York, I
Love You".

The “film” actually consists of“) short
vignerres, in similar fashion to its patent
piece, “Paris, je t'aime." This Gotham-
based collection is the second installment
of the Cities of Love franchise created
and produced by Emmanuel Benbihy.
Thankfully, each segment of “New York"
clocks in at around 10 minutes. so the aur

dience’s attention is kept relatively intact'

for the duration of the film.
Unforrunarely, the redeeming quali-
ties of rhe vignettes, individually and
collectively, are few and far between.
Though the cast of characters is, admi-
rably, as ethnically and religiously diverse
as the City itself, the problems begin to
mount within the first scene, in which
an attractive young girl allows herself to
be followed inro a neatlysempty bar by a
suspect man in dark sunglassesThe scene
ends peacefully enough (in that no one is
hurt or worse, as onecxpects might oc
cur in a similar situation in “the real New
York,") but the barrage of chance meets

ings and absurd verbal exchanges between
strangers has really just began.

The vignettes, though each one Cons
cerns itself with the problems and tri-
umphs of love, are poorly tied together.
Characters from the early scenes make
cameo appearances in later ones, but to
no greater purpose than to suggest, in a
manner vaguely reminiscent ofPaul Hags
gis’s “Crash," that we are all really cons
netted, even in a big, dirty city like New
York. Repetitive slow—and fast—motion
traffic visuals and shots of bridges from
moving cars serve to “transition” the audi-
ence from one scene to the next, in that
typically artsy, oh-so-quirky New York
fashion.

While one respects the endeavor, it
would be unfair to suggest that this ﬁlm
works, in any way, to bring together its
disparate parts. Unlike the thyroid gland,
which usually has to deal with either too
much or too little activity, “New York, 1
Love You" suffers from both ailments at
once. Ten vign‘ettes are perhaps a few too
many, in that at the end of the film, one
finds it difficult to recall the events of the
earlier scenes. And yet, the collection is
palpably repetitivcialthough there are
intriguing moments to be considered
along race and gender lines, the storyline
of each scene is, in effecr, rhar strangers
meet and carry on uncomforrably familiar
conversations until some twist about their
relationship is revealed to the (supposed)
shock of the audience. Add to the mix
a terribly contrived sense» of New York
style, complete with chain-smokers on
sidewalks, artists in eccentrically-tilted
fedoras and cafes littered with Molese
kine notebooks, and the result is a wholly
uninspiring medley that would turn the
stomach, or perhaps thyrotd, of any film
lover on Valentine’s Day.

This band wasn'r being pretentious, and i think because of
that people were able to key into and resonate better with
what they have to say, and how rhey say ir. Who doesn't
love friends. hot tubs and whiskey? I know I love their song
“Little Friends," which reinforces the candidness and fresh
sound that gives this band their spark.

Although I enjoyed their opener Rank Strangers more
rhan the Ponys themselves, the liveliness and buoyancy the
Ponys created was definitely an upper that left me feeling
more energized than when 1 came. They were happy to be
up on rhe stage, and we were happy to be listenin to them.

The band currently has three records out, " aced with
Romance,” “Celebration Castle” and “Turn the Lights
Out."My personal favorite, “We Shot the World," appears
on “Celebration Castle."
