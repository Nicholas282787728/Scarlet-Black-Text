A day in
the life

12 P.M. I wake upjust as my
roommate walks into our room
carrying my presents from last
night's birthday party. 1 play
with my gifts, which look like
they're intended for a prepubes
cent Child. Thereafter. Itake a
shower and go to Quad.

1:15 P.M. Walking back from
Quad, 1 come across an ad
For new 5&8 Columnists. Figurr
ing thatI need a reason to
procrastinate on homework, I
begin an earnest attempt to
write a column, One lost EsBay
bid, several Seinfeld episodes and
Four hours later, Ihnish writing
approximately 600 loosely-strung
together words.

6 P.M. I make plans to go to din—
ner with my co-host on Teabag
Attack (a KDIC show), where
we toss around ideas for our raa
dio show. We discuss instigating
some warmongering. the plunder—
ing of nearby villages and per
petuating stereotypes

7 PM. Dinner is over, and upon
exiting Quad, Istand ﬂahber-
gasted as rriends nrle through
sameone’s open bag to read the
label on their prescription bottle,

8230 PM. Alternative Break
meeting in the Forum. I am still
lamentingnnt leading a trip as
originally planned. However, my
co-leader was remiss of her prior
commitment to the cause and
pulled out abruptly. Now i stand
by, embarrassingly unable to
apﬂlogize lo the Alt. Break coma
mittee for our seemingly capris
cious behavior, but still manage
to nab an Alt. Break application.

10:45 P.M. I head to the library
to type my Research Methods
homework, leaving my stuff in
Bob's with my roommate and his
girlfriend. It's almost 11 pm.—
ﬁnally time to buckle down.

11:45 P.M. I return to Bob’s to
discover that my friends have
left my things unattended with
a note intended to ward oh‘
potential thieves. Unfortunately,
the note did little to prevent
three audaciously rude juniors
who felt it was their place to
sit in my booth and stuff their
faces full of food despite the Fact
that i still had my things strewn
about the table, I collect my
things as one of them halfheart-
edly apologi s to me and head
home. I’ve ﬁnished my homework
and intend to go back to my
room and play with my new toys.
