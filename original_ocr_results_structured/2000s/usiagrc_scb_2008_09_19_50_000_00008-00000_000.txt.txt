night adventures, Grinncllians
have Bill Hansen to thank, the
creator of the famous bakery rims
and current owner ofThe Danish
Maid Bakery.

The Danish Maid has been a
ramily-run operation since Han—
sen's father founded the business ‘
in 1949. Through I-lanscn's years
of helping his father at the bakv
ery, he has been actively involved
in the changes and growth of
the business while making sure
to keep the personal, small-town
charm.

Hansen started the tradition
of bakery runs in 1969 after be

create their products. One fateful
day, the student asked if he could buy something, and
the rest is history.

Hansen said the bakery run became a “quirky
thing" that characterized student life at Grinncll in
prior decades. “Kids came and would line up in the
ally, and they would wait 20 to 30 minutes to come
through,” Hansen said.

Present—day Grinnellians are just as enthusiasV
tic about their bakery run experiences. “I love going
on bakery runs,” said Kathleen MurphyrGeiss '11.
"Their stuffis really delicious, and I think it's reasone
ably priccd."

As a popnlai- student cscapade, the bakery rnn
quickly became a way for Hansen and his family
to develop personal relationships with the students
Thanks to bakery runs, Hansen said that he has
grown close to some Grinncllrans over the years, and
when alumni come back years later to visit, he still
remembers their faces. “Seeing them keeps me young
at heart," he said.

The N50 bakery run introduces firstryears to the
specialties that have kept Danish Maid Bakery in the
spotlight. such as the Coney, a crcamehlled pastry so
delectable that it was number 52 in the Des Molnes
Registers list ofIOO things to car in lowa before you
die.

Although The Danish Maid is already a town
staple, Hansen still strives to make the business grow
and thrive. He has recently added new creations, like
Pink Champagne Cakes, to thc menu,while keeping
old favorites such as Danish creme rolls. "Dad made
more stuff,” I-Iansen said,“but I make more ofa vari-
ety than he did."

While one otthe unique aspects ofThe Danish
Maid is its familyeowned history. when Hansen steps
down, the bakery will leave the family's hands For
now, however, Hansen remains the solo baker, kccpe
ing alive what is now both a family and a college
tradition “We remember them," Hansen said of his
Grinnell patrons,“and they remember us,”

Yummy new
Yumi's bakery

13v MORGANMERCER

Aftcl years creating baked goods from Grin-
noll’s familyerun bakery tradition The Danish
Maid, Grinnell students are just starting to icalize
that they have a choice in where to buy cinnamon
rolls,

Last March,Yumi's Bakery opened undcr the
ownership otl-lcidi Rockwell, and it has just re-
cently started getting attention from students as
another swcet place to satisfy a sweet tooth.

Rockwell. who came to Grinnsll to be With
her family, used to own a bakery in Maine, spee
clnlizing in decorated cakcs. Earlier this year shc
created a chocolate cake with raspberry filling and
a personalized computer decoration on the top for
a Grinnell first years birthday. Rockwell encourr
ages customers to special order anything they can
think of. I want it to bc a personal cxpcricncc for
someone who gets something from us," Rockwell
said,

In addition to cakes and other baked goods,
Yum i's also sells wraps,sandwiches, and smoothies.
Always eager for a new creative challenge, Rocke
well hopcs students will make suggestions to add
to the selection. “Ifyou arc missing any munchies
from home and want them here,let us know," she
urged.

Despite Rockwell’s enthusiasm for reaching
out to students, some Grinnellians are not aware
ofthe presence ofthe town’s new bakery. But YuV
mi’s quiet, relaxing atmospherc, wireless lnrcrnct,
and plans for a delivery service will likely soon
attract students‘ attention. Some students have
already caught on. “Their smoothies are really
delicious,” said Carly/Jerome ’11,

Before becoming a ﬁlll’l’lmc baker, Rocks
wcll worked as a traveling oncology nurse for six
months out of the year and found her days full of
emotional stress.

“When I came home,” Rockwell said, “I wants
ed to hit up my creativity outlet," She discovered
baking as the perfect way to rejuvenate her spirits
and ﬁll the other six months when she was not
serving as a nurse. Despite lack of formal train-
ing, Rockwell channeled her energy into perfect-
ing her family’s traditional recipes and opened her
ﬁrst bakery

With fellow Grinnell bakery The Danish
Maid already a landmark for Grinnellians. some
students have questioned whether Yumi’s pres-
ence will Icad to tension between the two bak-
eries. The rumors started mostly in response to
Yumi's decision to remain open on the night of
the scheduled bakery run during Nso.

“I don't know ifthcre was any tension," Rocks
well said. “We had hardly any customers, but we
were open."

Grinnell may be small, but the one thing a
college town can alvmys make mom for is another
purveyor of sweet and gooey treats. With their
spec‘lalized cakes and gooey Pecan Rolls, Yunii's,
like the Danish Maidqvill no doubt ﬁnd a special
place in all ofotlr stomachs.
