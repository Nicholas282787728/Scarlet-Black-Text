PEC problems pack on pounds

When I go to the PEC only to discover the weight
room is closed because the scheduled student worker
has failed to report, it’s like a punch in the stomach.
No, wait. It's not that at all: it's like another pound
slapped onto my stomach. No stairmaster means no
sweat, no calories burned. The most recent time the
weight room was closed when [came to work out, Isat
and read 3 YM magazine that was lying around1YM maga-
zine! The ﬂuffin that alone is enough to tip the scales.
The most exercise I got was when some mysterious adult
supervisor, wielding an ominous ring of jarigling keys,
chased me out and aggressively locked the door. Why
couldn’t I stay? Why couldn’t this keywlrielding guy have
called somebody? Ijusl don't get it. Yes, I could exer—
cise somewhere else, but no, I don’t enjoy that the

The good life ”back in the day”

Maybe 1 am only saying this because I am a ﬁrst—
year and this is my ﬁrst hell week, but college is
hard. Frankly, why can't Grinnell he more like high
school? Don’t we all reminisce about ”hack in the
day?” Everything was better. Even gossip: when ev~
eryone got to talkin giggles and whispers about who
"did it" with whom in the backseat of what. Here,
walLs are paper thin, so the rest of your ﬂoor knows
at the time, and everyone else ﬁnds out by the next
morning. Orpassing confessionalnotes toyourcrush
in English class, whereas now you have to dealwithin
drunken declarations, and than live awkwardly with
them every single day The best part was that when
classes were over you could go home, cuddle up on a
couch that wasn’t covered in cigarette burns, watch
an episode of Blossom, and fantasize about how great
college would he.

skateboarders and sleep deprivation

Skateboarders in the loggia need to go away. (30
outside. Go on the roof. I don't care, just go ﬁrthei
than two feet from my pillow Though we are few,
people n0 live nextto the loggia Every drunken shriek
at 3 a.m., every word about last night’s hookup, and
EVERY SKATEBOARD, we hear. Every time I'm either
taking a nap or studying, you start doing hips and
crashes and hangs. I don’t mind ifyou're skateboard-
ing by once on yourway to class, ﬁne. But every time
you go back and forth, and crash,jump and make lots
of noise, you are making me madder and more sleep
deprived. There are sidewalks all over campus, please,
have some respect, and stay out of the loggia while
you are doing your tricks, it sounds like a train two
feet from my head.
