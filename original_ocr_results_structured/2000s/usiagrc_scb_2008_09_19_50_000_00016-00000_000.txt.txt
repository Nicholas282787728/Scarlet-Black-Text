80’s Harris: This is quite possibly the most fantastic Harris party next to
disco. Not only do students get to prance around drunkenly in spandex,
but we also get to use phrases like ”as if”, ”like, totally”, and ”duh”.

 

 

 

PARENTS’ WEEKEND; It sure is great to see our families, but after goe
ing out on Friday night, it isn’t always easy to stomach their affection on

Saturday morning.

 

 

 

TOO MUCH ON SATURDAY: It seems as though there isn’t really
anything going on this Friday and yet there are a million different

things to choose between for Saturday.

Two things about laundry

1) Please do it when you have time. lfyou
know you're going to have to leave it in a ma-
ehine that’s no longer running to: more than 10
minutes, do it another time, especially ifit’s busy.
Delft inconvenience others.

2) Ifnll the machines are full, don't just (lump
out all the contents onto the ﬂoor. Duh! They
were just cleaned! Wait 10 minutes and if no
one comes to claim their stuff, then place the
clothing on top of the inuchine or in your bits~
ker. Clothing is personal, so be respectful to the
other person

Thanks!

What’s with the WaI-mart ads?

We were saddened and disheartened to see two
fullepagc VValrMnrr rids in tlic last issue of the m3.
There can't be many reasons, ﬁnancial or otherwise,
for the mouthpiece oru . rpposcdly socially-conscious
huetui arts college to prostitute itself out to what is at
best a morally dubious superstore. So what the hell?
Our expectations oryou nit already pretty low, hut we
couldn‘t see this one coming,You‘d might it well just
save some time and put some issues of the Ptnnytuvei
in the mailroom instead.

Hot Dog Vomit is cool, but...

Iryuu‘ie going to throw up hnifu hot dog onto
the set: ofthe toilet in Main Lobby, please, at least
push it oﬂ’ the rim and into the toilet bowLSome
ot' us ieiy on that co'Ly enclave to get us through
the day, and while I wouldn't mind ﬂushing your
evucuutions,touching your unchewed sausage is just
too much. I must give props to the bathroom next
door, though. because even though there are [W0
stalls and no run length mirror, Elle sunlight coming
through the window is pretty nice.
