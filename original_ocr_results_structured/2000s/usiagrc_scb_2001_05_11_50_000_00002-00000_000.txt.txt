A TRUE Smllv.

I breathed a sigh of relief as I
ﬁnally ﬁnished wn'trng the paper that
went along with the statistics project
I had been working on all semester
longr 0ur pror asked us to put our
projects in a public rolder so the in
formation could be accessed by ev-
eryone. I dragged the folder I had
been using to store my project in over
to the folder that the pmfessor could
access. It gave me an error sign.

What happened? I double clicked
on the folder I was dragging to, Where
was my project? I clicked Undo. Nothr
ing happened. lelieked Undo again.
Nothing happened. WHERE WAS MV
PROJECT? It was gone. Gone. A whole
semester of work down the drain.

where did I go wrong?

1, ldidn't print out the paper before
Itlled to move it. Always make hard
Copies. That‘s what printing double-
sided with two sheets per page was
made for!

2. I didn't save my project in mule
tiple locations. Save your work to the
Desktop, to the Documents folder, to
floppy disks (only as a back-up), and
go ahead and send yuurself a copy
throughyouremailiryourrolderisn‘t
nearing quota. Just make sure you
save it somewhere else!

Don’t be me Be smart.
