Brentano String Quartet
Mon. Oct. 6, 8 pm.
Seliring-Lewis

One of the world's most renowned classical quartets
will be performing at Sebririg-Lewr's Hall. The lluartet
has made appearances throughout the world in many
major music venues in cities ranging from New Vork,
Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles to London, Rome and
Paris.

Eugene Gaub, head oi the music department, said, “I
was impressed by how serious they were, and the
quality, and really their proiundity especially
considering how ygung they were."

The group iormed in 1992, borrowing its name from
the Antonie Erenmno who was believed by some to
have inspired Beethoven to write his infamous love
confession. The group includes Mark Steinberg and
Serena Canln on the violin, with Misha Amory on viola
and Nina Lee on the cello. All but Canin. who
graduated from Swarthrnure, hold degrees from the
Julliard School.

The quartet performs a fusion of modern and
classical music, They are currently on a tour celebrating
their anniversary by performing Bach Perspectives: ran
Composers React to the Art of Fugue. The quartet
commissioned leri composers from around the world to
write pieces commenting on one of the fugues from
Bach'sArt ofthe Fugue, his last written composition.
Each of the pieces involVes a dualism between one of
Bach’s fugues and the composer's commentary that
contrasts contemporary music with classical Baroque.

The tour serves as a conduit from past to present to
celebrate the progression oi classical music through the
ages, The quartet plays a juxtaposition of "classical in
the sense of older music and contemporary pieces in a
variety of styles ranging from jazz cross over to very,
very intricate intellectual music," said Gauh.
