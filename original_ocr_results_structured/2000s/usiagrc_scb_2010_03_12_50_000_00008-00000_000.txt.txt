Student perspective on printing

, As a student body, we use an excessive amount of paper. How-
ever, student printing comprises a small Etactlon of college print-
ing: last Fall, Bill Francis estimated students print about 2.2 million
pages ayear at2.37 cents a pageihat comes to alittle over 352,000,
about 5% of the 31,000,000 college printing and copying budget
President Osgood mentioned in his Seprem r 15th budget email.
But regardless of the cost,we have a responsi ility to self-govern our
printing.

.Thus far. the dialogue has centered around a costrbased punk
' g system. It is clear that many students don’t want to pay to print,
it’s also clear that many students want to save resources, While a
cost-based system rrtight appear to be the most effective way to save
paper, this makes the assumption that our primary concern is saving
paper. At an academic institution like Grinnell, dtis isnt the case.
The merits of reducing our paper consumption must be balanced
with other omemely important goals These goals include ensuring
all students, especially those with limited ﬁnancial resources, are still
able to print whats academically necessary Were here to learn; any
system that cunails academic' inquiry isn’t irt line with that primary
institutional g.oal

Such a balancing act extends beyond values. Practically, the ad-
ministrative overhead involved in managing a costebased system ,
and managing it fairly e is high. How do we resolve the aforemene
doned ﬁnancial concerns? How would an appropriate price he set?
A price that's too low provides little disincentive ro print. while one
that's unnecessarily high punishes studan for simply printing what
they need for dass. Determining an appropriate print quota presents
the same dilerruna. Furthermore, students with diﬂerent majors hav:
different printing needs. a Political Science major might print 200

pages in a week, while a Computer Science ma or prints none The -

system would need to appropriately resolve rhis dilemma, and do it
dynamically as such needs change. And as proposed, a costrbased
system would be implemented on only the printers publicly avail-
able to students. But lhere are multiple semi—public, departmental
printers to which many studenB have access. If students have access
to a bee printer and a cost—based printer, it’s obvious which printer
they'll use, Students outside the depanrnent would likely ﬂock to

these printers. as well. Many departments don't have the resources to
police the use ofrliese printers; without a costrbased system to man
age them, they'd become a freely-available, black-market resource,
hurting the department in the process. In such a model, the insti-
tutional FEE costs wouldn’t drastically decrease; they'd simply be

shifted to ‘ erent lines of the budget.

This list of questions and concerns is not exhaustive or com
plete. But it highlights the central problem: the administrative eirort
involved in implementing a smart and fair cosrebased system could
prove to he exhaustingAt rhe very least,it's going to be complicat d.
However, ignoring rhese issues altogedier violates Grinnell's cgali
tarian principles. There must be a compromise.

And in fact, there is. _The central issue is not cost or budget,
but resources. A cost—based system is not a prerequisite for reducr
ing waste, all we need are a few institutional changes and individual
solutions.

The institutional changes are the most effective the smallest
technological changes can make a large difference when deployed
campus-wideThese diangu are also die most csscniinl:‘lfwc'rc to
ensure a long-term solution to printing reduction, the changes we
make must be institutionalized and maintained at the highest level.
As students come and go, institutional solutions remain.

Practically, there are a number of things the college can do to
help reduce printing. Installing stations that queue print jobs (require
ing students to swipe a Pecard to release ajob>,but do not charge for
those jobs, eliminates the wasted paper that might get printed but
not picked up. sottvnre could be installed on campus (and personal)
computers dtat prompB the user to conﬁrm ajob before printing,
and even warns users when printing an excessive number of copies
or when printing singleesided, Set up all campus printers to duplex
by default, and make sure rhey stay that way throughout the year.

According to 1T5, when you factor in paper, toner, rhe cost ofa
printer, and maintenance on that printer, the cost of a page of paper
comes out around 2.37 cents. The actual paper contributes little to
dtis amount, toner is the bigger culprit. If we’re looking at reducing
the printing budget, we should also consider reducing the amount
of toner we consume. Ecofont is a good start: it’s a font that's dots
ted wirh small holes that reduces the amount of toner used by up
to 25%. The company (of the same name) provides educational
packages that integrate well into die Microsoft 033:: suite. While
this would help, many of the documents we print are not papers
we create. but rather documents from Eereserves and various other
sources.To reduce the amount of toner we consume when printing
those, printers could be set to default to "EconoModc", which prints
lighter, but less toner-intensive, documents.

Individually, more are a number ctways students can stir-govern
their printing. It takes only a little effort to save a lot of paper, Paper
does grow on trees; it’s a resource that we can and should attempt
to conserve. If at all possible. keep it electroni if you don't have to

print a document (for class, research, or otherwise); do your best to
read it on a computer. And when you do print documents, consider
printing doubleesided and two pages to a side, Print posters twtr
to-aes'tde, as well, halving rhe amount of paper you use to advertise
evens. If you own alaptop, consider bringing it to class to take notes.
The bins of one-sided paper are also great for notes or problem sets.
Neither ofthese lists ofsuggested changes is obviously compre—
hensive Our college breeds creative minds with potential that has
no limits. Let’s embrace this potential and brainstorm more creative
ways to reduce our pruning, eliminating the need for a costebased
system entirely

Dear Kington, meet the NLP

Dear Raynard,
Congratulations and welcome to the Grinnell Community: We
are very excited to have you as our new president and look forward
to the positive presence and energy we are sure you will bring to our
carnpns. As the new president, you are inheriting an institutional
legacy ot’acdvism, global consciousness and critical engagement.

As a group otstudents deeply committed to upholding the pro-
fessed mission and values of our institution, we would like to take
this opportunity to tell you about the No Limits Project, a student
group founded in the spring of2009. We hope this letterwill be the
start ofa healthy and productive relationship that will continue into
the future .

The No Limits Project is a non-hiemrdtical coalition otstudent
activists who came together' in die spring of 2009 to reclaim our
institution in the name of what we believe are the administration's
unmet commitments to social responsibility and jusuce. We are a
group comprised of a’diverse array ofstudents from various campus
activism groups who care deeply about issies including environe

tncntalism, religious and student life, mental health, and responsible

investment, to name a few. Togedter, we compiled a list of fourteen
demands highlighting unresolved dialogues with the administration
about long standing campus issues. Each of these demands reﬂects
longstanding campus issues. Despite numerous attempts by star
dents to engage with the administration over the past decade, these
concerns have been largely neglected and student errorts to work
with the administration considerably undervalued

Despite initial resistance from the insrjmtion, since our forma-
tion as a group this past year, administrators have begun to engage
with our demands. we worked closely with administrators as they
presented a comprehensive Hate Crimes/BiaseMotivated Incident
Response Protocol. Additionally, we secured partial ﬁnding for
AJust Grinnell, a peeretoepeer education program rhar seeks to {as
cilirirc workshops and discussions around issues ofoppression and
privilege. Most recently our work with rht Student Government
Association, Vice President for Development Mickey Munley and
the student group Free the Planet has resulted in a new my for
seniors to give money towards budding wind turbines to‘ power the
campus. In the future, we hope to work with the admissions ofiice,
the Ofﬁce of the President. and the Trustees of the college to reins
state needeblind admissions for International Students:

We believe that you have the unique opportunity to reorient the
college in both word and deed to its stated core values of social jus-
Lice, diversity, and excellence in liberal am education. As you men-
tionedin your introductory address, these principles have infomicd
your work and beliefs and we look forward to seeing the ways in
which these mines manifest themselves in your work on campus.

If you would like to read more about our group's history and
demands, please visit our website: http://nolimirsgriuncll.wordprcss.

Best wishes,

No Limits Grinnell

Direct donations to wind energy

Each year, the Senior Challenge is met by the graduating class
wirh a range of emotions running rhc gamut from enthusiasm to
deep resistance. The Senior Challenge seeks to raise money for the
Pioneer Fund, the majority ofwhich is used as unrestricted funds
to enhance the College's operating budget in things rangmg ﬁom
ﬁnancial aid to scholarly symposiums. Giving to the Senior Chair
lenge is the easiest, most direct way to contribute to Grinnells eve
eryday operation.

However, many seniors and alumni do not participate. some, in
seeking ways to demonstrate support for the college’s core value of
social responsibility, find this structure lacking. Many Grinnellians
are project—oriented; they want to contribute to more tangible ll'Li’
natives or seek an inspiring and speciﬁc nairarive of social jusrice.
Some Grinnellians have had disagreements wirh College policies
or allocations offunds, and feel that giving to rhe senior Chaucnge

With Alumni Relations and Development to create a more targeted
“Green Giving" campaign to capture the imagination of the larger
Grinnell community and help ﬁscally and symbolically steward the

We are theretore pleased to announce a ncw way to direct gifts
through the Senior Challenge on each pledge form, you will now
ﬁnd a line to denote your gift in support of the College's current
wind energy initiatives and the legal fees and research oosu incurred
in that process. Additionally, each donation in support ofwind en-
ergy will be tagged as sucli,heginning a record of how donors are
voting with their wallets

Anyone can donate to the Senior Challenge, and we encourage
everyone to join us irt our Green Giving project this semester Not
only is this is a great opponun‘ity to support an important, ongoing
project here on campusbut its also a chance for the student body to
set a precedent for greater engagementwirh the broader direction of ,

Response to Conlin article

This past Tuesdaywe spent some time with Roxanne Conlin, as
well as thirty five supporters and local activists at Uncle Nancys Cote
ice Shop in Newton During the question and answer periodJordan
Levine '10 asked about how we can reform primary education, and
whether inerit pay and charter schools are good ideas. Character-
istically, Roxanne put Jordan on the spot and asked him what he

. thought. It seems that on her 99 County “Fight to in It’lrcur she

has done almost as much listening as she has talking, With her visit
ro Jasper County, she has now heard the stories and policy predilece .
tions of Iowans in 73 counties aﬁross the state, a hill eight months
before the election.

The reason whywe bring thi up is that the article in last week's
edition, “Senatorial Candidate v its Campus," condensed this part
of her Grinnell Visit into one line. This entirely missed the pointi
Roxmne's tour isn't about drawing the biggest crowds or putting on
a show Instead, Roxanne calls on people individually takes the rime
to hear what rhey have to say and continents candidly.

Certainly, incumbent Senator Chuck Grassley can draw a crowd
at his town all meetings, but is that really what matters when he is
idling us boldface hes such as the government wants to "pull rhe plug
on granny/P Roxanne feels that Senator Grassley is our oftouch and
doesnt undcisrand the needs ofihe average rowan—tints why she's
running While her events have yet to yield crowds are size othiss-
ley s, that doesnt make them‘ train wrecks. "As Kathie Obmdovich
wrote in the Des Moines Register last week It might be a waste if
Conlin were just telling the same stones over again and checking the
coimties o3 her list. But time listening to voters is neter wasted. It
will make Conlin a better candidate andiif she gets the chance—a
much better senator.”

Iowa needs someone to ﬁght for us With the advice the com of
political activists who attended her February event, months in 'ad-
vancc of the election, we are conﬁdent that she will adequately be
able to.’l‘hese are the people she needs to talk to before die rest of us
become interested in the raceThat’s why she made Grinnell the ﬁrst
college she visited in the state: she thinks our students and residents
are an “inspiring bunch." and she remembers that we nearly helped
her win the govemorship in ’SZint wasn't Febrri ,we ould have
been upset that a community that prides itselfon its ac 'sm didn’t
come to engige the greatest lhreat to Senator Grassleys reign But
its early and the initial signs are positive. then the author of the are
ticle we are responding to admitted himselfthat he ms won over by
her substance, even ifthat part ofhis article was edited out.

Grinnellians have never been afraid to stand up for what’s right,
even ifit's unpopular We hope in the hittire our newspaper wont be
afraid to follow our lead. ~
