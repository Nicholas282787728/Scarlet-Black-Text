Latin American jamming

Energetic Latin American Ensemble performs this weekend

BY CAIT Scum

Gabriel Espinosa, lecturer rn Music, drives sew
cral times a week to Grinnell from his home in Pella
where he teaches at Central College. He treks from
one small—town college to another in order to direct
Grinnell's Latin American En-
semble,a group oils students or
varying class years and musical
backgrounds. The Latin Ameris
can Ensemble will perform to-
motrow night at 7:30 pm. in
sebring-Lewis Hall.

The group consists of eight
singers who also serve as percussionists and dancers,
in addition to five instrumental musicians, includ-
ing guitar, bass, two pianos and drums. Many of the
instruments are owned by Grinaell and speciﬁcally
designated for Latin American Ensemble. Singer/
percussionist Neo Morake ’09 described one of her fa-
vorite instruments, the guiro, which is a gourd-based
percussion instrument that makes a “frogslikc sound"
and, she said, is played with particular energy by Daisy
Ventura'09.

The Ensembles repertoire includes a variety of
Latin American genres. “we are playing everything
from boleros to sambas to bossanowis and cumbias,"
singer Elena Rubin '07 said by email.

Some members ofthe group have concerns about

”Hopefully it can lift people’s spirits.”

the ensemble's relationship with the Music departr
merit. "The fact is, I don’t think Latin American Ens
semble gets the respect it deserves,” Rubin said. “We
have been asking the Music department for a PA
system for who knows how long, and they have yet
to give us one. The fact is, we
are a good group who have the
potential to do a lot more than
we do now but we don't have the
support we need."

Many students sign up for
the group as a class for credit,
but it is also open to students
participating “just for fun," said Nathanial Gailcy—
Shiltz ’09, the ensemble’s bassist. Gailcytshiltz said
that one or the most enjoyable aspects orthe group is
its energy and ability to focus on “just having a good
time" while still maintaining the diligence of“a seri-
ous musical group.”

The tragic events ofrhis week made some ensemt
ble members question the upbeat nature of the pieces
they will perform this Saturday. Morake said that she
and several other singers “were talking, saying how we
didn’t know if we wanted to sing this songAit was
just too happy. But i think it will really help people,
reminding us that there is more to life at Grinnell
right now [than the sadness]. Hopefully it can lift
people’s spirits."

Mirror Monologues
Student-directed dramatic reading of Fires in
the Mirror addresses Black/Jewish relations

3v CAIT SCHERR

Angela Davis won’t be speaking
at Grinnell until next month, but you
can hear her meditations on commut
nity and racial solidarity tonight in the
ﬁreplace Lounge, Davis is depreted in
one orthc monologues in the play Fire:
in r/va Mll'l'm. Cl'a'lun Hug/22:, Brace
lyll, mid Ollm' Dim/flier, which will be
perrorrncd this weekend as a dramatic
reading as part ora Social Justice week
organized by Multicultural Manor and
other student groups.

Firm in t/ve Mil‘lm' is a provocative
collection or monologues addressing
to the 1991 Crown Heights Riot in
New york City During this threetday
conﬂict, violence broke out in reaction
to accusations of meial and religious
prejudice between the African-Amelie
can and Hasidic Jewish residents ofthe
neighborhood. The riots were sparked
when a car driven by a Hasidic man
escorting the Grand Rebbe hit two
Guyanese—American children. A prir
yateJewish ambulancc arrived and took
the driver and passengers but left the
injured children to be picked up by a
city ambulance. This event was the
breaking point or a long local history
ofviolent acts ofhate between the two
groups.

Foo in If): Minors playwright,
Anna Deavere smith, compiled the
19 interlocking monologues from in»
tcrviews she conducted. According to
organizer and director Molly McArdle
'09, many monologues are from crown
Heights residents a year after the ri-
ots, and others are from people such as
writer Ntozaikc Shange, MIT physicist
Aaron Bernstein, activist Angela Dar
vis, minister Conrad Mohammed and
writer Letty Cottin Pogrebin.

The play’s title refers to both the
riots (the ”Fires") and the unavoidable
ﬂaws in attempting to define identities
(the “Mirror").The mirror metaphor is
drawn from one of the monologues in
which a physicist describes ﬂaws round
in minors and their destructive effect
on an experimentr “We look at mirrors
when we want to form our own ident‘r
tyibut all mirrors have their own tiny
ﬂaws," said McArdle by email. “We all
look at the world, especially the fires of

the Crown Heights Riots, through our '

The event is primarily sponsored by
Multicultural Manor, with Concerned
Black Students and Chalutzim can
sponsoring, “The larger the collabora—
tion ofa production, the more people
get rnvolved, and the more people are
involved, the more people know about
it," said Jayson Wright ’09, one of the 19
performers. “And since the whole point
is to bring awareness to the community,
it accomplishes that goal." The event
is part of Social Justice Week. which
is organized by Multicultural Manor,
Social Justice Action Group, Student
Organization otLatrnas/osconeerned
Black Students and Chalutzim.

McAidlc described Firm in 11::
Mirrlil' as being “a lot orveryreal voices
coming at you all at once,"and that the
first time she had experienced this Pm,
duction it made her “think about race
identity and the politics of suffering” in
an entirely new \Wy.

“At Grinnell, we have the tens
dency to think that because we are
Grinnellians and we are liberals that
we’re above issues like racism, sexism,
homophobia, et cetera, and I find that
extremely dangerous," said wright.
“Any chance to confront these issues,
we need to take" A

Performances are Thursday, Friday
and Saturday at 8 pm. in the Fireplace
Lounge.
