central issue in his cam-

piign, “The tiustecs believe that our tuition should
fall in line with our peer institutions and that tuition
is directly proportional to value,“ he said. “I plan to
revisit a Strategic Planning documentwrirrcn in 2003
which highlighted the possibility of a ‘tuition trec
Griunellt’”

Some senators voiced concern that a North Cam-
pus smoking lounge was needed. other issues of
concern included the Coca»Cola boycott, a strategic
endowment spending plan and addressing issues of
sexual and mental health.

smaller, but no less important issues to the attention
ot Joint Board this session. “More than anything I
want to improve the openness of our Grinnell Col-
lege community."

In an effort to inciease the pool of candidates,
SGA President John Bohnian ‘06 and SGA Vice-
prcsident Chris Ochoa ’06 sent letters to over 80
students whom the Cabinet recommended as strong
leaders. Of the 17 elected senators, six had received a
letter asking them to consider running for office.

On July 1, 2005, users of the on-
line Grinnell Plans community were
greeted differently than normal when
logging into the systemt The welcome
page displayed a message from alum-
nus Sechyi Laiu ’04 announcing that he
was now in control of Plans. Although
a few users had already noticed that the
front page's dist
claimer now
mentioned

as a surprise to many,

bltili said that

Laiu did not
have legitimate
access to the server account since he
was not an administrator. “Instead of
complaining and talking about what
his problems were, he did something
that was totally bizarre and tincthit
eul,"hc said.

Laiu said that his actions were
justified because of evidence of ne-
glcct by the previous administrators,
including unread e-mails, failure to

renew the domain name and lack of ac»
countability with Plans fiiianccs. Laiu
was unable to grant the $81? a phone
interview due to his schedule and rcsit
dance in Hawaii, but he answered sevt
eral questions by c-mail. He said that
his goals were “to see that Plans sur»
vived [fiom neglect], that emails are
answered, that things
just work and move
administration to
cuti cut students,"

Roscnbluh called
Laiu's actions "(luv
main squirting," te-
feriing to the practice
ot claiming anotlier's
domain name and
selling it back at an in
flared price. Laiu said in an e—mall that
his renewal of the domain name was
an attempt to save Plans from domain
squatteis.

Shortly arrer announcing that he
was in control of Plans, Laiu posted
aiiotlict notice on the welcome page,
this time declaring his intent to trans-
fer contiol to a third party. Under the
heading, “So you think you can run
Plans?" Laiu invited groups or indie

In an e-mail, Laiu said,“I was hope

hands since I knew since the beginning
that I didn't have time for Plans.” Laiu
set up an election for users to decide
between the ten proposals that were

votes, there would he

posals. In addition, at least 750 Plans
users had to vote for a majority propos-
al to win. After extensive criticism and
wrangling on Plans over the fairness of
the election criteria, the second round
of voting failed to reach the 750 person
requirement that Laiu had insratcd and
the election was declared void.
