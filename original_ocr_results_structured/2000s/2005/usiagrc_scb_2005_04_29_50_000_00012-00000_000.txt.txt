Herz also ran a strong individual 800 meter time of
1:58.13 that placed him second—less than halfa sec-
ond behind Simpson's Nick Sorbe (1:57.67).

“I felt I should've been a little more aggressive in
my 800. I feel like I should've won, but sometimes
that's the way things shake down in a race like the
800," Herz said.

Other strong performances were turned in by
Tschida and Dave Honig ‘06 who placed 3 4 m
the 1500- Chad Rapp ‘07, who garnered a fourth

and a fifth place finish in tlilowing events and Ross
stuteman '07 who tied for sixth in the high jump.

“I'd say ovcrall we did pretty well," said Herz,
“considering there were some pretty good teams there
like Monmouth and \Nartburg. We had a bunch of
personal bests, and people ran rough races."

The women were led to their sitthsplace finish by
Sarah Spencer ‘08'5 win in the 1500 (4:56) and runs
ner-up finish in the 800 (2:26). Meredith Gloves ‘08
and Katie Ryan ‘07 also placed second and third, re-
spectivcly, in the 5000 meter run while Kate Dicdrick
‘07 clocked 13.27 to cross the line sixth in the 100
meter dash.

“I'd say overall, considering the weather condi-
tions, the team was pretty happy wnh their perfors
mances,” said sophomore Laura Zdunek, who ran a
personal-best time of 2:35 ovcl 800 meters. “Home
meets are a good time because everyone comes out
to the track and there's always a good flow oipeoplc,

whether its people walking by from the baseball game
or professors coming out. It‘s nice since we only have
one home meet a year."

Several members of the 1955 Grinncll track team,
which still holds sevelal school records. attended the
event this year and talked with the team.

“I got a chance to talk to the guy who holds the
record iii the 800.":aid Hetz.“1t was really nice to get
a chance to meet them," .

The men's and women‘s teams will continue their
season this Friday at the prestigious Drake Relays and
the Simpson Twilight lnvnarionrl. The Relays con-
tinue on Saturday.

Only a few mole tune-ups remain before the
Midwest Conference Track and Field Champion-
ships take place May 13714 at Monmouth college.
Last year, the men finished third while the women
placed eighth, but both teams, laden wrth young tale

In a season already full etwinning
streaks and losing sneaks, the Grinncll
softball team looks to end its s‘otsgame
losing streak Saturday at home against
Illinois college on senior Day

The Pioneers have lost three
straight doubleheaders after winning
five games in a row in midrApril. Most
recently, the team was blanked in two
contests at Coe on Wednesday. Grin-
nell also dropped two games at Lurher
College over the weekend, despite nvo

from Emily Kolbe ‘07 and Emily Stew
art ‘08. In the Contests, Stewart was
able to cxtcnd her consecutive game hn
streak to 14 games.

coach Tom Sonnichsen, as he has been
blessed with stellar starting pitching

“Ouroffcnsivcprodncnonmeasured
by runs is not wliele we would like ro

putting the ball in play and getting on
base, so this is a big improvement over
last season, Remember, we have a young
ream and we have a very challenging
schedule. Many of the teams we play
will be playing in the postseason. This
is great training and will really pay off
down the line."

Coe was one of those teams who
will be reaching the postseason tlirs
year, and after their trip to cedar Rap-
ids the Pioneers have scored six rims
in their last six games, none in their
last three. Heading into Saturday's ate
tion, Grinnell stands at 3-8 in Midwest
Conference play, and two wins on the
road would be a step in the right dlrce
