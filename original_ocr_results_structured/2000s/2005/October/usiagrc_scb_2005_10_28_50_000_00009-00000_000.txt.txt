Gab & Go must
remain an option

Fresh, delicious wrffles and eggs made-to-ordcr are
rwo ofrhe more convincing reasons co be up for breakfnsr
in the morning. But after spending an entire night writ— ‘
ing a paper, sleep is usually the frrsr rhing on the menu.

The new dining oprions that will be available the nexr
academic year are a large step forward for dining ser
vices. Grinncllians will ﬁnally have several different din-
ing options, including a pizza bar and an expanded vegan
secrion.1n addirion, rhe dining fuciliry promises greater
ﬂexibiliry, offering extended hours as well as diverse seat-
ing options.

Nonetheless, the new dining sysrem fails to consider
the student who docsn’r want to go to breakfast after
pulling an dllsnighter. It has no response for the student
who doesn't have class on Tuesdays and Thursdays unril
1:15 and doesn’t want to go to the dining hall for brcale
fast or even lunch once in a while.

Those students will have re use their own money to
by merls when rhey have time.Thnt's right, rhe proposed
dining system has no meal equivalency program.

For the pasr few years, Grub 8:. Go has functioned as
an effective meal equivalency program. It gives students
rhe option ofpicking up meals their they are planning to
miss or have already missed in a day.

Students sornerimes use Grab 8:. Go because they
— feel like eating lunch out-
; side on rhe lawn wirh rheir
friends or have meetings or
class. Ideally, meals could
be redeemed in the same
week or even semester to ac-
commodate studenrs‘ busy
schedules.

Grinnell already has an
unfair system that forces all
students to purchase plans
with more meuls rhan many
students will ever ear.

First-semester ﬁrst years
have no choice but purchase the 21»meal plan and every-
one else living on campus must sign up for rhe 10 meal a
week plan at minimum.

For those who don’t make all the meals, their money
is lost to Dining Services unless they gcr Grab 8c G0,
which is stocked with inexpensive and limited variery
bagged lunches already

By gecring rid of Grab 8c Go and ofrering no meal
equivalency, Grinncll would be ignoring the individual
needs of students in order to make more ofa proﬁt.

There are several cost—efficient alternatives that
would allow students to adapt the mandatory meal plans
to their individual preferences.

For example, dining services could resinsrnre Express
to provide students with snacks and beverages on rheir
own schedule, ofrer meal equivalency at die forum, con-
tinuc ro offer bag lunches and supply groceries for stu-
dents who prefer to cook in groups in the dorm. This
way, srudeurs won't feel like rhey are being cheared by an
unfair system. ‘

A large number of students believe (hat the Grab 8:
Go, or some similar program, should be continued during
nexr academic year. Dining Services, on rhe other hand, is
considering dropping menl equivalency altogether. 1f the
past is any indication, the administration’s interests will
trump those of students,

Two und a hulfycars ago, students vored overwhelm
ingly (over 95 percent) for a srudenr initiative to keep
Southern Express open as a meal equivalency.

Dcspirc rhc support, Dining Services stuck to its
doublespeak nbour sourhern Express us a rip off, rcsolw
ing the matter by unilaterally eliminating the program
without a replacement. lfsrudents are not vocal, the same
will happen with Grab Sc Go,

Dining Services

altogether Iflhe past

is any indl'mll'an, the

will {rump those of
students.
