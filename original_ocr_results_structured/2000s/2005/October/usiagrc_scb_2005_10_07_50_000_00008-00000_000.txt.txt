A unique rant

Their beauty was undeniable, but their ride is in-
creasingly unreliable.

The other day I bmught in a campus bike whose
rear fendcr was crumpled like a piece of aluminum
foil and was almosr complerely torn out. There is ab—

. solutcly no way that could happen with normal use!

So in echo of all those who have come bnforc me,
STOP ABUSING CAMPUS BIKES!

It’s not coolult's not fun. It‘s expansive. It is de-
structive behavior, and it is simply ridiculous. You’re
destroying campus property, and more importantly.
you are endangering a popular student program. At
the momcnt, SGA is currently talking about pros-
ecuting and potentially ﬁning known and future bike
molesters in judco. I think that is a great idea. Bike
abuse shouldn't be expensive to the student body,
Let’s pass along the cost to thcjerk who through the
hike off the loggia in the first place.

Tuesdays better

without

During my senior year or high school, my bags
lish reacher would read a chaprer from Tritrdnyl wit/1
Mollie to my class cvcry (get ready to (railway) Tucs—
da .

yAnd dcspire Mirch Albom‘s book dorninaring the
New York Times Bestsellers list for over four years,
every Tuesday as Mr. Tarian read about Morric’s dye
ing days, and the rest of my classmates fought back
tcars, I was desperately trying to stop my gag reflex
from firing.

Now before 1 receive a mass ofangry eemails nee
cusing me of being an insensitive ubcrrbitch, allow
me to defend this rcactionJ am usually prcrty scn-
sitivc about sad happenings. For example, Mufasa's
uneimoly dearli in Tim Lion King, pairod wirh JTT’s
incessant sobbin over his
motionless s, 1|lWllyS
movcs me to tears.

But although I did ﬁnd
Albom's story tragic, it just
didn’t move me in the way
that Slmba 8c company
did. My rhen 18rycarrold
sclfvicwcd the novel not
as the liforchanging epiphany so nanny had experi-
enceel, but as a conglomeration of sappy clichés on
how ro live a meaningful life that everyone had ale
ready heard a million times.

What’s that you say, Mitch
Album? All you need is love?
Money can’t buy happiness> We
shouldn’t worry about the small
stuff? Man, that’s deep.

Pardon my cynicism, Mitch
Albom, but I 1mm all that. I
know that in the grand scheme, all the little things
we worry about don’t really matter. I gotcha.

And then one day i lost my 575 tom: ofEnglish
Literature for my Brit-Lit class, and reacted as if my
beautiful puppy Snickers had been rrampled ro dearh
in a tragic neighborhood stampede of dogrwalkers
that had bccn instigated by hot
evil sister, Scarf, in a callous vi:
for ulrimare doggy power. In other
words, I overreacted. I swcatcd the
small stuff.

And here I realized, yes, quips
on how ro live a meaningful life
are cliché. lndubitably. They make
us roll our eyes, sigh in exaspcru»
tion at their trireness, and all times have even trigr
gored that undesirable salivation in the back of your
throat that only occurs right bcfote vomiting.

But the reason rhesc ideas still have meaning for
so many people, the reason Mairiz'r teachings tend
to resonate so deeply, is because no matter how many
timcs we hcnr them, no mnttcr how many ways thcy
are rehashed rhrough our minds via iilspitdtionnl
books and afrcrrschoolrspccials, we still need ref

no thing.

It was only a cookie

The orher day I was walking out of cowlos easing
a conkic,with a second cookie in hand. As I walked up
the staizs, the clicckcr spoke to ma. l-Imm...I thought,
perhaps she is wishing me a good day as mandated by
the new“Checry Checker” initiative. But alas it was not
to be. ,

Instead she chcuily informed me that I must take
a bite out ofthc socond cookic ifI muted to remove it
from rhe dining hall seriously Dick, an asinine policy
is still an asinine policy regardless of my cheery check-
erness that accompanies in For the love of God, you‘re
bti'ng UNREASONABLE.

What’s that you lay, Mitch Album?
All you need is love? Pardon my
cynicism burl know all that

Grime/l has the tendency {0 make
us worry. To make us aver/earl. But
you know what Grime/[.7 You ain’t

Morrie'

minding. Bcenuse we forget.

And though I am certainly one ofthe biggest for-
geriers west or the Mississippi, I’d like to otter you
(and myself) .1 little reminder: Grinncll makes us
worry a lor, but it shouldn't.

A lost textbook is not a big deal, nor is Younksr
computer lab printer running out of toner for the
thirteenth tiinc this weak, nor is an ex pretending
lie/she no longer recognizes your face, nor is the FX
not having any more soy yogurt.

It's okay if a professor uses up all the ink or his
brand new ted pen grading your combo resr, if that
cute guy in your Spanish class calls you "Lupe" when
your name is “Margarita," if the only mail you ever
get is your phone bill, if that TC kickcd you out of
ARI—I at 2 in the morn»
ing even rhough you
weren'r donc updating
your plan.

You will survive when
your favorite mechanical
pencils eraser goes missr
ing, when you don’t get
into a class you want, when your roommatc locks
you out, when you have a paper due at 8 am. and it
is currenrly 3.

Grinncll has the tendency to make us worry. To
make us overreact. But you know what, Grinnell?
You ain’t no thang. And so again,
I remind my fellow Grinnellians
(and myself) not to let our won
ties, the small things that don’t
go exactly th: wny w: want them
to, defeat us. Because that would
make Mitch and Morris really, res
ally sad. Plus, it makes life a whole lot more unpleasr
am.

And that's all I havc to say about that. In case
my spewing oi’clichc' ideas has been roo much for
your tummies to handle,please remember to request
a vomit cleanrup kn from your RLC. (Selfrgovcm

nance, pcoplsl)

But if you're still yearning for
more advice on how ro make your
Grinncll experience more means
ingﬁil, then by all means, check
our Tuesday: Witt Marti: and
give it a go. Morrie will remind
you about what’s truly important
(I’ll givc you a hint: it begins with
an "1" and rhymes with “dove"l and emphasize that
we needn't get so worked up about this thing we call
life.

But ifyou're like me and prcfcr your life lessons
delivered in a more musical, more Disneyesque, and
less gagrinducing way, forger about Morrie and in
stcad hcccl the advrce of the most famous warthogr
mectkut singing duo Africa has ever seen and
Hakim” Mam/i, It mcnns no worrics. -

Three strikes and you’re out

That’s it Grinncll, I've had enough. For two
weeks in a row 1 have had to solicit every rant that
has appeared on this page.

I’ve always hated those silly rants and I'm more
than willing to watch them whither away likc sclf— .
governance, Darby and orher failed Grinnell oudie
tions. In the spirit of all of the nerdy baseball fans
on campus, lct m: say that 1 hope you strikooiit and
never cnjoy rants again.
