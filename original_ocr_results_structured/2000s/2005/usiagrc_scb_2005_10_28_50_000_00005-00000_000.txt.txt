Calla, Celebration, and Princess
Friday, 9 pm.
Gardner Lounge

One—word band names must be in vogue these
days because tonight they’ll parade through Gardner
Lounge in the guise of three bands: Calla and their
openers Princess and Celebration.

So let’s free-associate. Calla sounds to me like
Calla lilies: elegnnt, sleek, a little upperclass — seme-

ﬂew

thing you have mostly nr weddings or funerals. The
fourtman bond is .1 little bit rougher and darker than
that. Touring for their most recent album "Collisions,"
they bring together their rockyTexus roots with a sleek
sensibility cultivated by their move to New York City.
Although they look like a wellegroomed bunch, they
use alleAmerican rock glitars with more electronic
backup to keep their songs cooking. Expect lots of
music in u slightly spooky minor key, with growling,
sultry vocals, which end up sounding a little like the
Stereopltonics.

Celebration sounds like it should be all candy and
cookies and pink and purple streamers and indeed,
the band has some fun with its style. Katrina Ford
does vocal acrobatics that walk the ﬁne Line between
screeching and low howls, without getting lost eome

plerely in either, Scan Anrnnaitis, who plays every—
thing else except the drums, celebrates thejoy of mu-
sicemak‘mg too. He bucks her up on the “guitorgrm,”
an electric guitar he modiﬁed to make organ sounds.
Strong punk singing strangely overcome by organ
music creates ‘tl circus of sound for which Celebmtion
is rightly named,

Finally, Princess will open first. The group tits its
name best, with one fellow in 2 tutu and a mustache
and the other looking like a sensitive indie kid.

They hail from Chicago and do their own brand of
artrrap with ironic herderoek references. They touch
on everything from Osama to enemas.Thcy seem like
they could be great or nwﬁil, but who isn't a sucker for
a guy with a tutu and a ‘stache?
