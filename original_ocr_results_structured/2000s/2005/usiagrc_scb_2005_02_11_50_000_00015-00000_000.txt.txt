record to sew, as the Pioneers were led by frrseyear
guard Hannah wolr; who scored 23 points. Katy
Bowen no also had a key pertottaanee, dropping 21

“It was huge for us to upset
Ripon," said Wolf, "especially

since we all knew we could do it.

The men's basketball team is also looking to tin—
ish a disappointing season on a high note. In their
latest aetion, they suttered a defeat to Ripon 112-
102.

The Pioneers were led by Paul Notdlund ‘06 and
Toby Carlson ‘06, who both eonttibuted 15 points
in just 15 minutes of play. Brock Martinez ‘08 had

Wolf. who has scored 20 or more points in each
of her last three games, was recently Midwest Con~
{erenee Player orthe Week. During her stellar week,
she racked up 72 points, 8 assists, 7 rebounds, and 12
steals. She also leads Divismn III in three pointers
made per game with an average one. Her play and
the combined eiTart ofcl fast and quickemeshoot of—
fense have shed some positive light on the end ot’the
season. The team will head to Fayette, Iowa to play
Upper Iowa Wednesday, and then it is haelt home
for the remainder of the season, beginning with 11-
linois college on Saturday,

“1 think that we deﬁnitely have the capability to
finish out our schedule with wins," said Wolf. “The
only thing we need to do is work hard in practices
and get up tor eaeh game. We also have to stick to-
gether, which we've done the whole season no inat-

HannahWolf'OB no shot at making the confer»

games are not meaningless to the
players, though, as the team wrl.l attempt to maintain
focus and ﬁnish the season with wins.

“Keeping toens has only been hard for me the
night atter we lose games." said lVIiIltlnez, “but the
ncxt day at practice 1 go out with the mentality that
we are going to win the next game we play, no matter
who it is. You need to learn from losses, but don't live
by thernThese next few games are going to be very
key in determining pieces for nest year’s puzzle as
well as giving the seniors a proper sendoff.”

The men will be baelt in action Saturday at llomc
against Illinois College at 3pm. The Pioneers beat
the Blueboys early in December for one ottheit two
conference victories,

“We just need to play like we did against them
the first time—relaxed,” said Martinez, “We came
out relaxed against Ripon and shot the lights out.
Towards the end ofthe half, they made a run and we
tightened up and the energy beearae very negative.
The key is positive energy.“
