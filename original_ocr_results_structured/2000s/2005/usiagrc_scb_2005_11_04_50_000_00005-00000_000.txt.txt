Bestill his heart

Although some Grinnellinns might feel ind look
“dead” from time to time, Linn Davis '08 has them
boat, at least for rhis wcckcnd. Sporting more than
sallow skin and baggy eyes, Davis is u zombie, and n
heartbroken one at that. ’

Directed by Lnura Mnrx '07 nnd sponsored by
GIMP, Zrmbic Pram, by Dana P. Rowe and John
Dempsey, features everything everyone loves and
hates about high school, dances, singing and the un-
dead.

The musical presents a fairly simple boysmectsV
girl story line but with on: major twist: its protagonist
locks n pulse. The boy, Jenny, played by Linn Davis ’08,
is from the wrong side of the tracks and falls in love
with Toffee (Stevie Schem '08) during a lunch room
nuclear muck drill. After her parents and Principnl
Delilah Strict (Katherine Jarvis ’09) pressure Toffee
into breaking up with him, Jenny throws himselfinto
a vat of nuclear waste. He hears her voice from the
other side, and wishing only to return to his beloved
Toffee, go to prom and graduathonny returns to his
high school as n zombie. Ace sleaze reporter Eddie
Flagrant: (Ben Baker’Oé) and Miss Strict add to the
drama.

Though its ending may seem to be tense and drain
matic, Zambia Pram is overall a light-hearted musical
and the actors have fun with their parts,whcthcr sing-
ing, dancing or acting. Their comedic timing rarely
fails to amuse,

With a good cast, from the extremely energetic
Davis to the delightfully almosr draconian Jarvis, and
an abundance of zombie and ractless death jokes,
zbmrrc prim is worth sccrng for uny fan of musicals,
comedies or zombies.
