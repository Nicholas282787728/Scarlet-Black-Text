After the most recent departures, Hill helped
mobilize the Coalition for a MllltirClllrural Campus
(CMCC). “The issue is much deeper than that sper

“make Central College the Safe, welcoming and die

Prior to the conference, Grinnell students had
been in contact with Central activists to support their
struggle against nicism On campus. The White Privi»
legs Conference allowed Grinncll students Liliana
Renteria ‘06, Sarah Lu ‘06, and Elena Rubin ‘07 to
continue dialogue with Central student activists.
