grammlng, President Russell Osgood said he
would like to ﬁnd someone who would be able

The Chalutzim Committee has expressed
a concern that the new associate chaplain

have threatens religious programming, and m,
hgions programming is a valuable asset,” said
committee member Daniel Foilmer ‘05.

“I feel super conﬁdent that we’re adequate

After a \WOryciil' absence, public hikes l‘CT
turned to bike racks across campus lnstThursr
day. some have alicady faced vandalism.

Foul students, including SGA Adininistr -
live Coordinator Mike Mnloney ‘06, worked
resulted in the purchase of the 20 new, bright
yellow Atlas Industi ial bike last summer. SGA
and Student Afta' spli<thc $1800 cost.

Foul to ﬁve bikes will be kept at the Forum
and can be checked out for personal use (or

teied around campus.

Craig Cooper, owner of Bikes to You,
helped pick the model and order the bik ,
He said they are meant to be tiseablc by eye
eryoncihence the steprthrough frame and
quick-release seats—as well as be “simple and
durable.” The bikes have steel frames, core
rosionrresistant Chains, and sturdier wheels,
spokes, and tires,

The signiﬁcant fendei and ﬂame dents,
popped tires, and loosened bolts on several
bikes are not a result of normal use, said C007
per. “They are probably next to the most due
table bicycles that can be purchased. Wear and
tear did not damage those bicycles; it was bla-
tant vandalism."

Five to ten bikes are currently sitting in
SGA ofﬁces waiting to be ﬁxed. “I think it’s
unfortunate,” said SGA Student Services Co»
ordinator Drew Blackmail ‘05, who oversees
the campus bike program. "It isn’t something
we foresaw."

Some bike seats have also been taken. Ac-
cording to SGA Vice President Rebeeea Miller
‘05, some of the seats have been brought back
to SGA oﬂlces. SGA is considering buying
seat locks to alleviate this problem.

A similar program failed two years age af-
ter many or the bikes were vandalized or stOr
len or fell into disrepair. This time, however,
Blackman will be hiring one or two students to
maintain and keep track of the bikes.

Previously, “the biggest problem was they
didn’t have anyone to maintain the bikes,"
Blackman said. “That’s important to me, to
keep the program running.”

The bikes were also a hassle for SGA, said
Blackman,as many ofrhem ended up in disrer
pair, indeﬁnitely set aside in the SGA Ofﬁces.
A new work and storage space will soon be
opened in Gates 4012,a former single, accord.

will encourage people to keep them in better

gram has been working well.

”People are dedicated to maintaining the
program," Blackman said. “Everyone seems to
be really excited.“

According to Maleney, plans are already in
the works to purchase more bikes later this see
mester or next year. The college also will apply
identifying decals, he said.

“I think now that they’re out there, stu-
dents are really enjoying them." said Crady.
“People have come up to me and said ‘thank
you,'which doesn't happen very often."

Anyone interested in helping maintain the
campus bikes is encouraged to Contact Black-
