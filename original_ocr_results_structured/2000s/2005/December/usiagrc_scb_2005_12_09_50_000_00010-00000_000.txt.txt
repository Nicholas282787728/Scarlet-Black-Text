Mark Finkelstein should recognize the tremendous difference between anti-Semitism and valid criticism

One wonders if Mark Finkelstcin, who
“supports the establishment of a Palestinian
state aside a secure Israel" (12/2), had even
bothered to read “TheJerusalem Sabeel Docu-
ment,"which supports the exact same scenario.
This document, which was distributed dur
ing the Sabeel conference on the IsraelisPals
estinian conﬂict, discusses in great detail the
Sabecl's “Principles for a just pcacc.” Sabccl’s
vision for the future, as it is described in their
mission statement, “involves two sovereign
states, Palestine and Israel. This scenario
envisages the total withdrawal of Israel from
all the occupied territories
including east Jerusalem
according to the United

and 338. . ." (The Jerusalem
Sabeel Document).
Finkelstein
claims that Sabeel “ate
tempts to delegitimize 15,
rael" and is “aimed at doing away with Israel.”
However, if he had taken the time to read sec-
tion number six on Sabecl’s List “For Endur-
ing and Comprehensive Peace,”he would have
stood corrected: “The Palestinians and all of
the Arab states must recognize and accept the
state of Israel within the 1967 borders. This
could be done through “The Saudi Plan”
which gave lsracl full recognition by all Arab
states at the realization of the complete and to-
tal withdrawal from all occupied territories."
lwas especially disturbed when I rcad Fins
kelstein’s misleading paraphrasing from the
Chicago Tribune archive. According to Pin-
kelstein, Sabeel's president and director Rev.
Naim Ateek had said that "the presence of the
Jewish state is temporary, only to be subsumed

okay that interest in environmentalism seems to have ebbed.
My qualiﬁcation “as long as students still care about and work
for other good causes" should have followed. Students here
certainly are involved, and what I meant to convey was that I
understand we all have a limited amount of time to apply to a
broad array of issues, and that the issues to which we apply our

time are bound to vary from year to year.

As long as we arc active for the good or others, the details

are less important. I must admit, though, that

in a Greater Palestine which would end Is-
raeli sovereigiity"(17inkelstein 12/2). However,
when going back to his sourcel discovered that
Ateek had never said this. In fact, he said the
exact opposite of what Finkelstein has quoted
him as saying. Ateek said that “Sabecl pros
motes a tworstate solution 7 a Palestinian state
alongside Israel," and did not at all mention a
“Greater Palestine”. He also said that he is “not
attacking Jews or the existence of the state of
lsracl, but rather is only criticizing thc policies
of the Israeli government." (wwalﬂiidwillllll.
lam/Ill’wlﬁﬁﬂllﬂil) ?NPl:4t?0)

criticizing Israeli policy
is exactly what I have been
trying to do in my last colt
umn for the SBB. Finkel-
stein‘s claim that I could not
differentiate between critir
cism and anliTsemitiSm is
based on a series of quotes
which have been misinters
prctcd by him, and which he has taken out or
context in order to alter their original mean-'
ings.

The same strctcgy was also used by Fins
kelstein to try and discredit renowned Jewish
and antirracist actiVist Tim Wise: “Mr. Fin-
kelstein decided that because I have written a
few articles that are critical of Israel and that
question the validity of Zionism as a political
movement, he should seek to torpedo my con-
tribution I—Iis blatant misrepresentation of
my views is truly shameful." (btqtsﬂwwuaxi-

resentation taken from his last letter to the
S658 regards Professor Jeff Halpcr's remark on

Additionally, the congressman my subgroup had bccn lob-

in context, Halper is describing his vision for
a ﬁlnire democracy that equally serves all of
its citizens: “Since the Palestinian and Jewish
populations aie so inter-
mingled (a million Pal-
cstinians live throughout
Israel while some 400,000
Jews live throughout the
Occupied Tcrritorics)

[116 most practical solution
seems to be a unitary democratic state offering
equal citizenship for all... onc Person, One
Vote."

He thcn movcs on to explain the demOs
graphical problem that Israel is gradually faCs
ing, trying to maintain aJewish state on the base
or a “dwindling chiah majority" (III/p mow.
fromwaifid/fﬂ/ca’l‘X-VIAUrg/nﬁdafbp?! e 72).

Jeff Halper, an Israeli Jew, is definitely not
the first to call for the establishment of an
Israel-Palestine democratic State belonging
to all its citizens. Martin Buber (187871965),
perhaps the most important Jewish religious
philosopher of the 20th century, “was still liv»
ing in Germany in 1925 when a numbcr ofhis
followers in Palestine started an organization
called Brit Shalom (A Covenant of Peace)
which based their ideology on Bubcr's writs
ings, advocating a democratic birnational state
in which Jews and Arabs would be completely
equal." (www.kebi[lar}1nznggue.brg/Ke/yi/IAMEs
PMM/DbmmenLIIlbIm/J

Sabeel agrees that “the ideal and best so,
lution has almys been to envisage ultimately
a birnational state in Palestine—Israel where
pcoplc arc free and equal, living undcr a con»
stitutionai democracy that protects and guars
antees all their rights, responsibilities and

Unfortunately sharing Will never

learn to communitate and

duties without racism or discrimination. One
state for two nations and three rehgions" (The
Jerusalem Sabeel Documcnt).

Although reminding us ofJohn Lcnnon's
idealistic lyricsi‘imagine
there’s no countries"*5a—
beel maintains a more
practical and realistic view
point by advocating for a
tworstate solution which
will “provide the minimum
basis for a iesolution,”and that is exactly what
Ateek means when he says that “The only
way forward is by sharing the country" (www,
107nm: [mil/m [blwl/julyOI/OI07057.1erl).

Unfortunately, the signiﬁcant idea or
sharing will ncvcr be rully accomplished uns
less people learn to communicate and listen
to one another. Conﬂict is known to occur
when people choose to hear what they want
to hear instead or listen to what is really be
ing said. Finitclstcin’s interpretation ofsome of
the things that were said by Sabeel speakers
is just another example of a selective hearing
that takes things out of context and creates
conﬂict.

Furthermore, his repeating attempts at
discrediting renowned peace activists through
false allegations of anti-Semitism are extremely
dangerous and unacceptable ways with which
I-‘inkelstein hopes to stiﬂe any critical discus~
sion on the subject of this conflict. With this
article, 1 wish to cncoumgc proplc to go at»
tor the truth behind thc quote and get to rhc
bottom of what the source is really trying to
convey, instead of reacting in an impulsive way
that rejects even the most legitimate criticism
against a government's policy.
