Mental health, trustees, security,
CoerrCola.These are among the many
issues the S {51? has covered over the
last semester. In most articles, several
srudciirs are interviewed. Hoping to
discover the wider mood of the college
on some of Grinneil’s most important
issues and institutions, the S U B eons
ducted a lsequcsrion
survey with 79 runs
clomly selected stu-
dents.

Students an
swered questions on a
one to live scale, one
being very positive,
three being neutral
and five being very negative.

The survey addressed the following
issues and organizations: RLCs, SAs,
Senators, professors, administrators,
trustees, security, SGA, student groups
and the S (3E.

The survey also asked students if
they thought Grinnell'was a healthy
campus, whether they thought posi»
tively about the student body, whether
Grinnell prepares students for the fit-
ture, whether the college is headed in
the right direction and whether they
were proud to go to Grinnell. '

Trustees faied poorest in the survey
with administrators coming in second.
No srudcrit surveyed rated them in the
highest category of approval. only 11.9
percent and 39.2 percent of students
agreed that trustees and administrators,
cared about their concerns, respectively.
31.6percentand 35.5
percent of students
were neutral on the
issue, while 54.5 per-
cent and 35 .5 percent
of students disagreed
or strongly disagreed
with the statement that trustees and
administrators cared about student
concerns.

“I think [trustees] are too focused

”I think [lruslees] are loo focused

on making this school match up to
competing schools," Zach \ilcgcr-rnann
‘08 said. “People choose Gtiimell for
what it's stood for in the past, and they
should stick wtth that.”

Professors earned seine or the high
est marks. sol percent of respondents
agreed or strongly agreed that plofesr
sors cared about their academic success.
12.7 percent of students were neutral
and only 1.3 percent di. greed.

“1 have had only one exception of

really was not ace

who categorically
was just very rigid,"
Liz Ward '07 said.
“Aside from that, the
faculty is definitely
one or the college's
strongest suits."
students gave mixed results on
many of the organizations that com~
prise student life. About one-third
of snrdents surveyed were neutral on
whether SGA and their senators were
doing a good job.

About one-third
also rated student
groups and the s to
B neutrally. The re-
mainder were mostly
split between positive
and negative tniuks.

Respondents
were also divided on
whether Grinncll rs heading in the
right direction or the wrong direction.

percent disagreed and 30.3 percent
were unsure.

right track," said Megan de Arniijo
v09. “There are some things I wouldn't
agree with. For example, they are ralke
ing about getting rid of merit aid and
I think something like that would de-
crease the diversity."

Despite the divided opinion on
many of the issues affecting campus,
the survey results demonstrated that
Grrnnellians were overwhelmingly

proud to attend their
school: 82.3 percent
of students said they
were proud or vety
proud to Grinnell.
Only 13.9 percent
were neutral on the
issue whiic 3.8 per
cent disagreed. Zero
respondents said they
strongly disagreed

"I'm really conﬂicted in the sense
that I'm really proud of the academic
work I do here and that takes place
here,” Lay said “I’m really proud to be
associated with that part. But rhcre is a
lot of hypocrisy tied up in the school
I feel Like kids get screwed around with

“1 like going here, and I know that
it’s a good school," Ward said. “I know
things are changing, in terms of the
student body and the image, not neces
sarily in a good way, but I’m still proud
to tell people that I go here, if they’ve
even heard ofit."
