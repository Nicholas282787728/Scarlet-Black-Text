Former director
of UNICEF to
speak Monday

Carol Bellamy’s controversial
decisions appealed to Com-

mencement Committee

at LINN DAVis

Carol Bellamy, former eaecutive director or
UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund,
will speak at commencement on Monday

Arrer [on years with the organization, Belt
iamy left her post in April. She has since taken a
job as President and CEO or World Learning, a
Veirnontehastd non-gorernmental otgllnizlition
focused on international education.

“We‘re really glad to have her and lucky to
catch her lit the end of her UNICEF tenure," said
Rachel Bly ‘93, director of contorentc operations
{oi the office of Communications and Events. “I
think the timing for this was fortuitousThis gave
her an opportunity to give a major address at the
end other tenure."

Bellamy took over the organization in 1995
after two years as directoi ofthe Peace Corps In
two terms as head of UNICEF, she broadened its
objectives to include advocacy and onerheeground
work for women's ights, education and heairhcare.

UNICEF maintained loi1g~s . i ding child
medical cart and hunger relief programs, but 13617
iamy argued that improving women‘s lives aided
children's interests as well.

This move, however, wen Bellamy her share
of ciities. In 2003, the Catholic Family and Hut
man Rights Institute published a report stating
that Bellamy was a “radical feminist” and a “fervent
abortion proponent,"

Detracto claimed that Bellamy’s nevv direee
tion to. the organization was dangerous, degrade
ing to males 1d anri child They recommended
that the United States by {at UNICEF s lnigest
supporter, wrthhoid is Contributions

In the end, Bellamy did not change her policies,
and the Bush administmtion did not deny UNI-
CEF funding.

“i think that’s one or the things that appealed
to us—that she hasn't been afraid to get out there
and push the envelope,"Biy sai .“She's been a little

controversial. in a good way."

According to Bly, Bellamy has been to Grinncll
before,when she was director ofthe Peace Corps in
the early 905. Grinncll has long been one of the top
colleges in the nation in the number oraluinni who
join Peace Corps following graduation.

“I know she thought highly about Grinneil
even befoie she was asked," Biy said.

Names ofpossible speakers cum: from a variety
etseuices, said Biy, including ratulty, start, students
and lists ofpast candidates.

The seniorrun Commencement Committee,
along with Bly, then narrowed the list or names to
a handrul of potential speakers and ranked them.
The committee, which is also in charge or orgih
nizing events such as 100 Days, Baccalaureate, the
senior Showcase and the Senior Party at Han-is,
did not iron out its ﬁnial chaices until after winter
break.

“We try as much as possible to make it the de-
cision otstudents on the committee,"l31y said.

The faculty will also award Bellamy an hon-
orary degree at commencement. This is custom-
ary, although not obligatory, for commencement
speakers

Ann veaeman, former secretary ongl'icultute
during President Bush’s ﬁrst term. has replaced
Bellamy at UNICEF. Veneinan is eipeeted to rce
mm the organization to its more traditional cliilde
focused policies.
