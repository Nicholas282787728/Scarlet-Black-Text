Fabulous
fibers

An SEtB reviewer visits Grinnell FiberWorks,
the new quilting store in town, and happily
ﬁnds both fabric and friendly owners

BY Atv BEERV

My mother is a maker As a cirrld,
this meant several things. One, my bed
was (and still is) always covered with
something she made. Two, our dining
room table was never (and still is not)
prrnrarrly used for eatingialways cut-
ring and piecing. Three, shopping trips
for supplies were (and still are) the best
part about quilting.

I loved going to quilting stores—
shelves full of patterned fabrics orgae
nized by color (I was drawn to the neon
shades nla 1991), fabric paints (which
came in similarly obtrusive shades),
beads and buttons by the baslietful, and
samples ot’quilts, skirts,
shirts, baby clothes and
pillows covering every
bare inch of wall and
shclrspace. .

I got the same giddy
feeling when l unrlkcd
into Grinnell Fiber
Works, a two-month-
old store in downtown
Grinnell that carries
some of the most w,
brant and beautiful
fabrics I've seen in one
place, in addition to
a colorful and diverse
selection or yarn and
knitting supplies, beads,
fiber art, and materials
for tatting, crochetrng,
doll making and de-
signer pillows.

Melissa Lewis (who rnitiall , helped inc),
moved to Grinncll, the two ofthem loved
to talk aborrr how much tlrcy admired the
town because it was unique, small and in
retesting, but there was something miss
ingia qllilt'sltop. “We're not out just to
make money, but to bring something to
the community," stud Shannon.

When the space at 831 Main Street
(across from Godfather’s) became ltvailr
rrblc, Shannon and Lewis got to work,
even though Lewis was pregnant. “It
wasn't planned that way, brrt Shane

classes the store has held so far are um—
br‘clla painting (which I was skeptical
of, but quite impressed by when 1 saw
the end result), amulet bag necklaces
and Dllarma blanks (blanks are white
clothes that yorl dye, paint or mark up
with markers). Lewis did that they hope
to have ilmng classes soon, and more
classes are being added as artisans make
themselves available rot teaching.

The store generates the most sales
from rabric rust and yarn second, and
the patterns and
styles they are '
fer are different
from what can
be found at VVrtl-
Mart, Michacls.
Hobby Lobby or
even most small
quilt shops in this part oflowrt, Shannon
buys het fabric from small companies
and intentionally purchases items that
would be hard to find elsewhere. “We
can't compete with chain srores,”she said.
“I won’t carry big company patterns l
buy mostly from designers who are doing
their- own marketing.”

Shannon gave me a mini-tour of the
fabrics, Frtsr, her ravorite: “These are my
cowboy and cowgirl prints," she said,

cows, lassos and, of course, cowboys and
cowgitls.

“And these 1116 the ﬁesta prints,"

pointing to two rows of br ightlyecoloted
fabrics with ﬂowers, ash and other rrop-
ical partyeinspired prints We walked
past two shelves of fabric that resembled
many of the patterns seen in the spring
JCrcw or Urban Outﬁtters catalogues.

“And here is the produce isle," she
said, and stopping in front ora shelfthat
held fabric dotted with fruits and veg
etablcs such as kiwi and carrots.

The fabric isn'tjust for quilts. “We’re
hoping that the wearable arts take off,"
Shannon said. I had to have her say it

I got it—ah,

world is much more fashionable than
out Home Ec horrors.

“It brings the rndrvidrralism back to
style," said Shannon. “People up there
[in h'lirirlcapolis] love rtl" Grinnell Fl-
berWorks has the materials and patterns
for many wearable arts, such as ponchos,
skirts, sarongs, baby clothes, shawls, wine
ter apparel, bags andjewtdry, for starters.

My biggest complaint about Grin-
nell FrberWorks is the amount of mon-
eyl could spend there. I was impressed,
however, that even though their more
chandise is gorgeous, a lot of it is very
reasonably priced for a retail store (see
sidebar for some sample prices).
