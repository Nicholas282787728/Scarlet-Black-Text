Students hauled a cow up the

myth:

The entire myth goes like this:
Several years ago, mischievous
students hauled a cow up the ﬁre
escape and onto the Cowles’ roof
loggia as a prank.

However, the joke went morbidly
awry when the cow refused to walk
back down the stairs, and Facilities
Management had no other choice
but to butcher it right there on the
loggia.

Since then, the school has added
a policy that dictates immediate
expulsion for bringing farm animals
onto loggias.

was forced to butcher the cow
to get it off the loggia.

”That’s a story that has perme-
ated most colleges, butin 50 years,
it hasn’t happened here,” said Wally
Walker, professor emeritus of Biol»
ogy, who has worked for Gn'nnell
since the 19405. "Though," he addr

conﬁrmed that she has personally
never heard of anyone bringing a
cow onto the roof of Cowles, but
said there would probably be some
sort of administrative action taken
if such an event were to occur in
the future.

Ira Strauber denies having ever
failed an entire tutorial. Like many
other long-term faculty, Strauber
does not frequently teach tutorials,
and the rumor likely started because
students believed there was some
reason that Strauber did not seem
to ever teach tutorial. In his thirty
plus years at Grinnell, Strauoer has
gained a certain amount of no-
toriety for being both tough and

sarcastic, which is why the rumor
probably stuck.

"’Myths' get started for a variety
of reasons (or causes)," Strauber
told The Scarlet and black via email.
“It is a safe presumption that this
’myth' served someone’s self»inter-
ests."

Strauber will be teaching a tutor
rial in the fall entitled "liberal Edur
cation and Critical Citizenship."

John Mutti, Economics,

myth:

Although John Mutti did work
for the Reagan administration as
a senior staff economist on the
White House's Council of Economic
Advisors from 1985 to 1986, Mutti
claims that his advisory group was
just "one of many" and that he
had ”very little" inﬂuence over the
President.

In previous administrations,
someone with his job would have
occasionally sat at a large table of
economists and helped bn'ef the

myth:

An anonymous Grinnell student
told the 5&5 that several summers
ago, he and some friends pried up
a manhole between ARH and Noyce
and crept into a small tunnel be
low, "There were a lot of hot pipes
in there We crawled through the
tunnel for what seemed like a long
time,” the student recalled. After
all that effort, the tunnel ended
anticlimactically in an empty room
on the Noyce side and the slightly
more spacious ARH basement on
the other.

According to Wally Walker, a
professor emeritus of Biology who
worked at Grinnell for over 40
years, the current Grinnell tunnels
are a shadow of their former gran-
deur. Earlier in the school's history,

president. However, under Reagan,
those meetings were too often
leaked to the press so the admin-
istration "threw out all the underr
lings," Mutti said. Thus, these "uni
derlings" had to resign themselves
to positions of reduced influence.

Teaching at a liberal college
after having served under Reagan
might sound strange to some but
Mutti said, ”I wasn't even a Re-
publican, so I was working for that
President."

Walker recollected that "the last
really serious blizzard" to hit Grin-
hell did so on the night or Spring
Waltz sometime in the mid719605
and kept the prom-polished girls
on South Campus from walking
outside to Darby, where the prom
was held. So, said Walker, the girls
went underground and walked
through the tunnel to get there.

However, the heating pipes in
the tunnels were insulated with
cancerrcausing asbestos, so the
college was forced to close the'
tunnels and fill them in. The re-
maining tunnels are for Facilities
Management use only and full of
steam pipes and wires.
