\Vorkplace '[ncq lialily Awareness
Survey Results

in order to assess workplace inequality awareness,
a group of four students from Professor jennifer Ryan’s
GWS class surveyed ISO people within the Grinnell
College community (94 women, 54 men, and 2 who
did not identify as either) Some of the results were as
follows:
Question: How would you qualify people’s awareness on
the issue ofpciyment inequality between men and women7
A. Unsatisfactory: 33% of men and 56% of women
B, OK:46% of men and 35% of women
C. Good: |5% of men and 9% of women
D.Very good: 6% of men and 0% of women
To the same question, among those who responded,
“unsatisfactory," 33% of them also felt they had been
discriminated against in some way in the workplace;
of those who answered “OK,” 22% had described
discrimination; and of those who responded “good,"
|9% had felt discriminated against. Our research also
revealed such misconduct as pornography displayed
in the workplace. sexist jokes and comments in male
dominated work environments. denial of promotion
based on gender and sexuality, and even unfair treatment
based on status as a parent. More information can be
found in accompanying ﬂyers available in the post ofﬁce.
