WAKING UP SCREAMING AND REALIZING
YOU HAVEN'T FALLEN ASLEEP YET.

Response to Postman

Boycott, cont. from p. 9

The more attention a particular issrre
garners through protest, the more voices
are heard screaming, "Someone With the
power, for this nowz" It is a nice idea to
offer solutions, bur the protest itself rec
ogniacs that solutions are outside of the
protesters’ power.

1 suppoit the coke boycorr inase
much as it says, to rwisr a phrase from a

friend, “You shit the bed! Clean it up!”

Or, ifwe plan on blaming this thing on
the companies Coke pays to bottle their
products, “Your friend shit the bed! You
invited him, you clean it upl" We could
care less what cleaning methods are
used; we just want a clean bed agalui

Frankly,I do not care how Coke fixes
the problem, Solutions, as a consumer,
are not within my jurisdiction, Cons
suinprion is. Consumers have every right
to withhold their consumption for any
dissatisfaction. Corporations, especially
those as large as Coke, have the power
(rend: money) to do a lot ofthings.

Our voice is our ability to give rhem
that money. This is the point of the boy-
cott: to make Coke effectuate changes,
because if they do not, they will not be

so profitable anymore. They will lose
the power they are trying to maintain by
shipping cheap labor overseas.

Nevertheless, as an exercise, let me
see ifI can be more imaginative than Mr.
Postman in conjuring up possible solu~
tions to the problem, other than forming
a militia and closing plants. How about
Coke building and running its own
plants in Columbia, rather than hiiing
thirgs and warlords to do so?

How about coke enforcing conr
tracrual minimum wages and humane
working conditions in all its herding
factories that do not require workers to
strike for better wages and conditions?
How about Coke investing in the coni-
munities its workers live in, so so al
conditions do not promote violence and
murder? I do not know how feasible any
of these solutions are.

1 wish I had rhe money to institute
changes that would make workers'overr
all living conditions more amicable; yer,
I do not. I bet, however, that someone
does—maybe someone else should say
something to them,

Alcoholism at Grinnell must be addressed by campus community

When I received the invitation to submit a column
to the S813, many ideas went through my mind. I
could write about the wonder that is computer science
and why more Grinnellians should take CS, but that
would be perhaps too selfrserving, 1 could write about
conﬂicts between faculty and student views of self
governance, but that topic has probably been visited
too much of late.

I could write about my Tutorial’s work to rewrite
the College’s intellectual property guidelines, but we
are still early in the process. I could write about why
faculty don't like to accept requests for interviews from
the SE53, but that is probably not a topic of general
interest, I could write about the need for gadﬂies at
Grinnell, but that topic clearly belongs to John David
Stone (and perhaps he will write about it for a future
issue).

In the end, I decrded to write about something
that I care a lot about and thinkwe need to address as
a campus a community: problems with student alco—
hol use on campus I apologize in advance that I lack
knowledge about key issues, that 1 will appear judge
mental, and that part of this column appeared previr
ously on my Plan. HoWr
ever, I also know that we
have significant problems
and believe that we need to “
address these problems as a “
campus community lhope
that this short piece con-
tribures to rhar dialogue.

Do I think it's a problem that many students drink,
and that many are underage? No, not really. Drinkr
ing is a normal part otlifc, and a normal part of colr
lege life. Do I think it’s a problem that an increasing
number of students are arrested
for underage drinking or tor dis-
tributing alcohol? While I don't
like having our students arrested
(and don’t agree with our national
diinking age), l accept that when
you violate laws, even bid laws, you
may be arrested.

so,what do I see as the problems? one huge prob
lem is rhar some Grinnell students regularly drink to
excess, Some students may know how common etcesr
sive drinking rs, but I don’t think faculty realize how
often students drink enough that they are sent to the
emergency room.

I would consider it a problem rfwe had two stri-
dents visit the ER for drinking each semester,and it is
my understanding thitwc have significantly more ER
visits than that. Tile first problem we need to address
is this excessive drinking,

But it's not the only problem to address, A related
problem is that students often choose bad reasons to
drink (and yes,l realize thitl am being judgmental
when I write this). From my perspective, there are re-
ally only two good reasons to drink alcohol in mode
cririnn (there are no good reasons to drink to excess):
You like the taste or you enjoy the way it makes you
feel. I suppose that it's okay to drink to moderation to
socialize, although I would hope that one would drink
nonalcoholic beverages in such situations unless one
of the prior two icnsons hold.

Democracy died?

“Democracy died on November 2nd, 2004!”

“Umm didn't George Bush win the popular
vote?"

“Didn't you hear me? Democracy died!"

“Actually, Bush's victory was more an airirmation
ofdemocrdcy."

“Democracy. Died."

“Bush won the popular vote. it’s as simple as that.
ldon't like him, you clearly don't like him, but de-
mocracy didn't die that die. If anything, it showed
up stronger than ever judging by the increase in turrr
out.“

“Ali, 1 see your pointr Thank you, you have really
shown me the error nfmy ways,"

"Not a problem, Hey, they're serving pizza at
Quid today. Yon coming?"

“Fizz/a)! I‘m in like John Roberts after the Senate
votcl" And everybody learned a valuable lesson, but
forgot it later that weekend. '

Faculty Guest Column

Our sense of community is one of
Grinne/l’s grearsirenglns, and we
thou/d take advantage (if/I.

Unfortunatelylhearawidevarietyofotherreasons
that students drink. Here are some common ones,

“I drink because there’s nothing else to do in the
middle of Iowa after 9 pm. on a Friday night." 1
would hope that students as bright as you are could
find more creative uses ofyour time,

“I drink because I'm shy and drinking makes it
easier to talk to people.” Although that may seem like
a tempting reason to drink, it is worth your time and
effort to overcome your shyness without alcohol.

“1 drink because I experience a great deal of stress
at Grinnell, and drinking helps me avoid or cope with
that that stress." Stress is unhealthy. Doing something
else unhealthy is not a good response Dealing with
stress is hard, but there are healthy ways to cope. (Ex—
ercise is a good way to start.)

“I drink because all my friends drink, and it's not
much fun hanging out with them when they’re dmnk
unless I’m dmnk too." I would hope that Grinnellians
were mature enough to resist peer pressure (or to pro-
vide peer pressure to ﬁnd other things to do).

These two problems are clearly not our only prob
lems with alcohol I also think too many of us (cer—
tainly faculty and students,
perhaps also some adminisr
(rotors) are in denial about
the depth of the problem.
I’ve heard students say (ap—
proximately). “My friends
and I don't drink, so it’s not
a problem." Many people
accept that college drinking is a normal rite ofpaSr
sage ln America, and don‘t worry too much about the
details I've certainly worried less about Grinnell than
1 should have, partially because drinking is so much
more moderate here than where I
previously taught. But when snir
dents regularly need medical care
for their drinking, and regularly
drink for bad reasons, we need to
do something.

What should we do about
these problems? Here we begin to go beyond my ex»
pertise. l have heard some great student and alumni
recommendations for better local counseling for those
with drinking problems, for better places on campus to
drink socially and for revised Harris party rules.

I don’t have great suggestions of my own, other
than that we need to acknowledge the problem and
address it as a community. Our sense ofcommuniry is
one of Grinnell's great strengths, and we should take
advantage of it.

As a communiry, we successfully addressed another
significant (and related) problem, depression on cam
pus, and we did so through a variety of techniques.
Perhaps most importantly, we admitted we had a prob—
lem and we reminded each other regularly about the
problem. We also took rcsponsibiliry for each other.

When Grinnellians see students who seem to be
depressed, we talk to them and try to get them help.
Perhaps if we all made it a point to talk openly and
caringly to people who are clearly having alcohol
problems,ivc could at least start to address these prob
lems. It’s probably a naive response, but 1 hope that
it's a stair.

Test failure blues

Among all mings in the world, poverry, oppresiori,
,violence etc, the thing that irks me, that brings out my
dark side the most is walking out ofa test and immedi—
ately figuring out the answer to the test question I was
lost on. What an awfid feeling, as if my own mind her
trayed me and would not, for that short period of time,
allow me access to the needed information.

What follows is a week or so ofwaiting for my pro-
fcssor to return the test, knowing that it will only can—
ﬁrm my suspicions. I knew what I did wrong a week
ago, and ir took you that long to tell me? Maybe I'll

‘ try to avoid this painful process next time by actually
studying.
