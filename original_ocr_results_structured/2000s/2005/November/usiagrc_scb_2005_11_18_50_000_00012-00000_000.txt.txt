As Thanksgiving rapidly approachs
es, Grinnell College sports fans should
be thinking about the many things they
are thankful for: KGRN 1410 AM.
thermal underwear and of course, the
women’s soccer team.

The Pioneer women have given
students something to look forward to
for more than two months. Now that
their season has ﬁnally come to a close,
it's time to look back and remember
why we should think of soccer and not
turkey this Thursday.

The women’s soccer team had an
amazing season. They posted a total
of 11 shutouts and went Sal in the
Midwest Conference, making it to the
second round of the NCAA Tournan
merit before falling to Macalester last
Saturday

The Pioneers ended the season as
the MWC champions for the second
year in a row and this is the first time
in Grinnell women’s soccer history that
a team has had a NCAA tournament
victory

To top this on: six players were
awarded AllnMidwest Conference ti-
tles. Rebecca Mackenzie ’09 and Julia
Bradley-Cook '06 were given Second
Team All-Midwest Conference titles.
Kara and Rachel Moskowitz '06, Kate
Kiedrick ’07 and Liz Carrier ’07 were
given First Team All-Midwest confer—
ence titles.

This didn’t come as a surprise to
many, given the stellar performance
by the women’s team throughout the
season. There is no question that these
women are competitors

The Pioneers went out like chamn
pions, making their presence known
in the NCAA Tournament by handily
defeating Lakeland last Wednesday be»
fore their loss on Saturday.

The Pioneers came back' hard after
Lakeland scored during the sixth min-

with a goal two minutes later, sending a
solid header past Lakeland’s goalkeeper
off a corner kick by Rachel Moskowitz.
Kara Moskowitz scored off a break
away in minute 26 and Gabi Maldos
"ado-Bell ’09 scored 23 minutes into
the second half.

“I think it showed a lot of heart by
the team that we didn’t just give up af
ter one goal,” said forward Katherine
Ni '09,

“They probably caught us on our

‘heels a little bit, which is why they

scored first," said defender Emily

Scholten ’06. “But one ofour strengths
as a team is that we can really rally. We
pretty much dominated Lakeland."

The team went up to Minnesota on
Friday night in order to have plenty of
time for the big game they had ahead
of them.

“We had a lot of meetings where
we just talked about our goals for the
game," said defender Kelly Brouse ’09.

“For every person on the team, we
wrote something either to encourage
them or pump them up," said Ni.

Macalester scored three times dur
ing the match on Saturday, defeating

the Pioneers 3-0, and taking the wom-
en out of the tournament.

“We lost 370 and that was lame
but we played with them,” said Schol~

en. “We created good opportunities
against them and theyjust finished and
we didn't."

Only time will tell how far next sea
son will take the women’s team, but un-
til then, the women can be happy with
the way the season played out.

“Its the best we’ve ever done,” said
Scholten. “I can’t ask for a better sea—
son."

Neither could we.

Season at a
Glance

' Women's soccer
closed the season with
a record of l4~4-2
overall and a record of

year in a row

Women' s basketball preview

The women’s basketball team is coming off of one
of its most difficult seasons since Head Coach Andy
Hamilton’85 rebuilt the program three years ago.

The Pioneers’ challenging schedule was exacerbate
ed by the construction of the new gym,which forced
the women to play more than half of their season on
the road.The women have a lot of room to improve
this year after posting a 6—17 record last season, but
they are more than up to the challenge.

“I think both the members of the team and the
coaching staff are excited this year," said Hamilton.

Although the team has lost three of its guards to
graduation, five new freshmen and a junior returning
after being absent for a season will fill the gaps.

“The major difference between last year’s team
and this year’s team is that we have more players who
are taller," said Hamilton. "We have six players who
are either 5'9", 5'10" or 5'11", which is double the
number we had last year.”

The Pioneers will be led by co captains Lauren
Meredith 06 and Katy Bowen oo.

Bowen has been instrumental to the transforma-
tion of the womcns basketball program.

“If you can point to any one person the team has
been shaped aiound, it’s been senior Katy Bowen,"
snid Hamiltonr “She has a chalice to be a four year all-
confcrence player Shes a three year captain which is
kind ofcxtrltordinary and will probably pass the 1000
point total sometime this season.

The Pioneers will begin their season with a home
game on Nov. 22 against Central College.

“We’re excited to open at home [this] Tuesday,"
said Hamilton. “We have this wonderful facility now.
which has helped us in practice, but we have to find a
way to make it a home court advantage for us."

Show your support for the Pioneer women and
teach Central the meaning of home court advantage
this Tuesday at rhc new Darby Gym.

A lone figure steps onto a three-meter diving board at Obers
miller Pool, concentrating on the few seconds of action just ahead.
Hours of weekly training would soon culminate in one ﬂeeting mo-
ment of athletic free-fall. Suddenly, speakers switch on below and
“I’m Too sexy" begins to bounce off the walls ofthe pool.

Showtime. Without hesitation, the diver sashays down the cat-
walk and flips gracefully into the water.

Thus began the annual swimming and Diving Alumni Meet,
Alums from as far back as the class of ’72 returned to compete in
the water and on the diving board at Obetmiller Pool on Nov 12.

li was it much lighter mood compared to the previous day. On
Friday, the team competed in a more formal meet to set individual
starting points for the rest of the year.

“The improvement we made in one week was really encourag-
ing," said Head Coach Eric Hurley, noting that she had felt last
week’s times to be somewhat disappointing

The enormous improvement since the time trials last week gave
everyone on the team a boost ofconfidence.

Spring Knapp ’07 came within twostcnths ofa second of reach-
ing her season goal for the loosmetcr breaststroke, 1:235, in the
very first meet of the year.

“That kind of time drop this early in the season is mind blowing,
especially for someone as old as l am,"snid Knapp. She felt confident
in the team’s ability to clinch its eighth consecutive conterencc title
after Friday’s peifoirnunce, “We had a lot of really talented seniors
leave but we’ve had a lot of really talented first years come in,"

sophomore Sean Wal'lick was also plenssd with his Nov. 10 per
formance. “Swimming well this early in the season is a really good
indicator," he said.

Wm lick swam the freestyle leg ofthe ZOOameter rncdlcy relay in
22.7 seconds, one ofhis fastest times.

Last Saturday’s alumni meet kept the positive momentum going
with an exciting and entertaining array ofshort relayst The swim-
mers divided themselves into odd and even graduation years, allow
ing firstycars of’09 to team up with alums from ’83.

In some relays, recent graduates also had the opportunity to
compete against the current swim team.

Although the current women's team beat their alumni competi-
tion, the men's team split the races against the alumni, winning one
and losing another.

“They just managed to squeak a win out," said co-captnin James
Taggart 06.

The most entertaining theme of the alumni meet centered
around alum Erie country" Blevins (is, a former diving captain
who went to nationals his senior year

Tnggart found rhe wcckcnd encouraging for both swimming and
diving. “1 think [both teams] will be really strong this year," he said,

Although diver Garnet Smith ’08 will miss six weeks of the SENT
son due to a ruptured spleen,Tnggnit is confident that smith will is-
turn strong and help lead the diving team to a strong scison finish.

Watlick ended the weekend feeling confident about tlle team’s
prospects “We should win conference again. We don't want to make
any predictions, but it's a very real goal."
