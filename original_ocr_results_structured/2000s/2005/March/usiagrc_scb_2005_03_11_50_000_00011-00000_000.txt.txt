A: Canriy, LIS Lt btskLrbnlI LoLLLiL, you're di~
recting the players to play cohesively and to play
off each other's strengths. Basketball, by some
accounts can be described as the greatest team

In tennis, my job is to help our individuals evaluate what their op-
ponent’s strengths and weaknesses are... In tennis, the preparation is
done more at prnLtiLL nLLd less during the match. Although probubly
my greatest strength as a tennis coach' is my ability to see opponent's
weaknesses and communicate it to our guys.

point win, and our senior anrnin cried in the locker room because she
hadn't won many contests,

We hnd un unbelievable match ngninst Ripon in men's annis in

6-1 two weeks prior to the Conference semiﬁnals. We pulled out a
