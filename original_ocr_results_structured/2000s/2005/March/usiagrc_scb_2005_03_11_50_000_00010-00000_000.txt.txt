At the point that we have stlbslaiiccrlrcc
housing, at the point that the administration
blatantly ignores the concerns of a majority of
students regarding tuition increases and other
matters, at the point that swastikas can appear
throughout campus and the only response of
students is to “match against prejudice and hate
crimes" and form a committee “to discuss hate
crimes and discrimination," selfegovernance is
dead,

Selftgovcmancc is really qull’c simple, how-
ever, it seems that many of my fellow smdents
either have no clue as to what selfrgovernariccr
or invoke self-govemnnce as a trump card to eat
plain why they should do whatever they umnt—
much like the right wing otrhe Republican party,
which now makes every issue a moral issue (if
anyone can tind the verse in the Bible that says
“social security is iininotnl,”l will personally give
them $20). Self-governance can be boiled down
into two simple points: (a) take responsibility for
your actions and stupid things you say; and (b)
be respectful of other people, even ifit means not
doing everything you want to do.

What are the implications orsuch n simple,
boiled down, easy to understand interpretation
of self-governance? For staitets, it might mean
not puking in the hallway, and ifyou do cleaning
it up yourself instead making the janitor clean up
your own bodily ﬂuids. But it would also mean
that substance-free housing would not be needed
on campus because those who want to get drunk
would be respectful of those on their ﬂoor and

on campus who do not want to deal with bodily
ﬂuids all over campus. It would also mean that
people who dont want to drink would lime to
interact and ask that their position is respected,
lets say at least 90 percent ofrhc time, Sclfegow
ernance would also mean that you don't vandals
ize campus, and if you do you immediately take
responsibility for it and pay to get it ﬁxed. Those
who take part in hate crimes, should go before
the campus community, publicly apologize and
be willing to carry out whatever community tern
vice, or other requirements that their peers feel
ncccss aty to repay the debt they owe to die carn-
pus community
At the point that all individuals cannot figure
out how to m/Ilal/y practice self goveinance. we
must accept the administration doing away With
selftgovcrlmncc The college must seek to stop
vandalism iffor no other reason that it is expensive
to consorntly replace windows and other broken
property, but more importantly because vand Il’

cannot stop their pccrs, or are unwilling to torcc
their friends to be accountable for their actions,
what choice does the administration have other
than allow the police on campus and set up other
rules that infringe upon selﬁgovcrnance? itstu-
dents cannot practice selfrgovernance which we
all love so very much do our words actually mean
anything? lfour words don’t mean anything why
should the trustees care what we think in regards
to steep tuition increases?

“Liberal and accepting?” I think not

It was around 12: 30 a. in. when that e mail
was sent out. I don‘t think I need to tell you
which email I’m talking about. Needless to say
I was shocked. Not that somebody had scrawled
such a thing onto a poster. No, that's expected.
It's a reality of life that no matter how liberal
and open an environment is, there will always be
people with narrow minds and angry hearts in in
It’s an unavoidable fact

Nor am I shocked because of what it reprer
sents. I am used to hatred, threats and violence.
One of the lessons I learned in Indonesia dur»
ing my eleven year tenure there is that is so easy
for other people to misunderstand one another,
to prejudge, to let hate take the place of under-
standing. In the years following 9/11, I became
a target for being an American, despite the
fact thatI in no way agreed with anything the
U.S did overseas. Perhaps even worse 05 were
those who were targeted not for being Ameri-
Cm, but merely for associating themselves with
Americans, Numerous terrorist threats against
my school and others shut it down for almost a
month. I lost a teacher in the Bali Bombings.
However, one can always take comfort in the fact
that, ultimately, those that hate most hurt them
selves. I know for a fact that multicultural groups
can, no, should get along, and I know what hap—
pens if they don’t.

The reason I was so shocked by this was be-

cause ofhow whoever did' it chose to s it. This
is not representative ofthc Grinnell spirit, Grins
nell rs better than this. such a supposedly liberal
and understanding community should be able to
listen to all opnrions, no matter how controver-
sial or disagreeable that opinion might be. The
reality, however, of Grinnell is that it's not as u“,
derstnnd'tng and accepting as we’d like it to be.

The recent reactions to the campus Repub-
licans'postets is endencc enough of that. Is it
any wonder that whoever scrawled those swasxit
kas inside Lazier would do it in the middle of the
night and without letting it be known who he/
she was? Can you imagine the backlash that this
person would’ve gotten from our "liberal" and
“understanding" Campus? Perhaps it's time to be
honest. We're not as open as we so often like to
hype, and not all views will be accepted. Hell,
even something at relatively mild as Republicans
are frowned upon here!

What Grinnell seriously needs is a good, hard
look at itself. What whoever wndalized Lazict
needs is a forum for otpressing himselfin a mans
net that will not immediately draw boos and
protests, but create a serious discussion in which
prejudices on both sides will be cast off and ev-
erybody will be heard equally and fairly. Then.
and only then, will Grinnell truly be deserving of
its title of a “liberal and accepting community,”
and until, well only be fooling ourselves.

Perpetrators should read Holocaust lit

The svmstikas round on campus over the
past weekend have left many Grinndl students
feeling hurt and tnistrated While originally a
positive symbol in Buddism and Hinduism, the
swastika has been morphed into a symbol that
many people see as representing deep hatred and
bigotry It also represents the ideology dint fueled
the destruction of millions of people in Europe
during World War II.

There are almost thirty students enrolled in
the course on Holocaust litcmture, taught by
German professor Jenny Michaels, this semester.
The students have had the opportunity to read
several survivor testimonies, such as those by
Elie Wiesel, Prime Levi, and Gerda Weissmann
Klein. Students have also read in depth about the
history of the Holocaust and done their own 1“,
dependent research.The large enrollment Dfsrur

dents in the course demonstrates that Grinnell
students are interested in learning about these
important issues of racial hatred and the desmlc-
tion that can stem from it. As we have seen on
campus this past weekend, acts of racial hatred
under the banner of the swastika continuer

However, as students of Holocaust literature,
we ask those who drew the swastikas to perhaps
read the story of Elie Wiesel or Gerda Weiss-
mann Klein. Read how the Nazis systematically
destroyed these authors’ communities, families
and souls and those of millions orothers simply
because ofwho they were Maybe after reading
these works they will see the mic signiﬁcance of
the mstikn.

Diversity more
than skin deep

Dear sore,

As I read the article on V? jouarhan
Brand‘s new appornuncnt to Doane Collegc,l
was simultaneously relieved and distresoed. In
the article, the SEER notes the continued lack
of race and gender diversity in our adminis-
tration. The article seemed considerably less
cynical than a similar one published several
years ago, when the sail} ran its first version of
“Whos in Charge Here?

The level-mindedness of this article was
pleasing because it seems as though the tag
has changed its stance on blindly criticizing the
administiation based on gender and skin color.
1 hope that this change reﬂects an increased
awareness and appreciation of the genuinely
dimcult task or hiring new faculty and staff.
While such a task is difficult anywhere, it is
especially rough in Grinnell, Iowa.

The college only receives i lrrnited amount
of interest iii many of its hiring searchesThe
best and the brightest nationwide seem m,
lucrant to move then lives to Grinnell, wheie
linding challenging work for spouses and
strong education for children can be real chals
longesThe town lacks not only the entertains
ment and excitement of larger towns, but also
the economic and cultural appeals that invari-
ably accompany onr nation's largest cities. But
more importantly, the town lacks something
else — diversity.

Apart from college faculty and interna-
tional students, Grinnell is as white as its
administration. Local businesses seem just as
prone to gender politics. Still othei minorities
— such as GLBTQQmembers — remain mar—
ginalized to varying degrees both within the
college and the town,

For all of these reasons, it is rough to are
tract the best faculty and administrators. Ac
cordingly, when the college deer and someone
who is the best, they should not hesitate to
offer them a position just because their skin
color or gender will not help improve our Stu»
tisrical numbers on diversity.

“Diversity" is a misleading term. It overcme
phasizes artiﬁcial (and by thntl mean humanly
created) distinctions between skin color, gm,
der, birthplace, or even hobbies. Most of the
time, the terms use gives no consideration to
thought or action. These are areas where die
versityis mosrvaluable,whieh brings me to my
point.

Over the last few weeks, Grinnell had the
opportunity to hire one of the best teachers
that 1 have ever met. Professor Caterine, who
is on the cutting-edge of his held, is here this
year as a temporary hire in Religious Studies.
The college, much to their credit, considered
oerering him another year at Grinnell because
otsrrong enrollment and praise from students.
When that consideration became a challenge
to create a new position, the college gave up.
And as a result, one of the best professors on
this campus will end up teaching somewhere
else

Although 1 have no way of knowing for
sure, it is my suspicion that the college would
have made a different decision ifrhis professor
had been some “race" other than white,

At any rate, the college passed up it wont
dcrful opportunity for diversity. Professor Ca-
tcrine specializes in Latin American and La»
tino/a religions. More importandy, his ideas,
methodology, assignments, and communicar
tion with students are all unique.

Professor Coretine also constantly inspires
his students to challenge the hegemonic dis-
course of race, gender, and class in our society
And by our society, 1 also mean Grinnell. At
every level — from the classroom to the town
to national politics e Professor Caterine is one
“white” guy who embodies the term diversity.

Sustaining the protest

Gi'innell has a long history ofpolitical and
social activism, and the iecenr march against
hate and accompanying discussions are a pow-
ei-ﬁil testament to that heritage. The campus-
wide outrage regarding the swastilcrs scrawled
in Lazier bathrooms and on Nollen House was
appropriate. such a symbol represents a horrilie
time in history and has an undeniably hateﬁil
connotation.

Such symbols should never be ignored, lest
we forget the tragedy they represent. Specue
lotion as to who drew the swastikas has been
oﬁﬂedda drunken strident, a bored high-
sdiooler, a Grinnell student trying to provoke
apathetic peers, or, worst of all, a neoeNazi
intending to Express the hatred and prejudice
the swastika implies. Whateter the motive, the
swastika: brought up issues that desperately
need to be addressed, and many on campus are
trying to address them

But the activism this event triggered should
not stop.The hatred a swastika represents exists
before, during and after someone draws one on
a bathroom Wall, and we should not just ads
dress this hatred and prejudice when a tangible
event draws our attention to it.

CBS held an open forum on race at Grin-
neil last Thursday and as was pointed out at
Monday night’s meeting at the Forum, the
event did not draw as large a crowd as did the
forum after the swasrilcts were found. It is easy
to get caught up in friends, homework and try»
ing to catch up on sleep. We know the news
paper staff was too athausted from newspaper
layout to attend the forum on race.

On a campus that is generally more open-
minded and accepting than the average campus
or town, however, it is also too easy to forget
that such ignorance and prejudice exist. But it
does, as we were reminded by the stories shared
on Monday about acts of discrimination stu-
dents have experienced one and offtcampust
The swastika: make it even more obvious that
we need to have a sustained conversation on
these issues again.

Forums,mcerings and marches have always
helped, and will always help, address such emos
tionnl and pervasive problems as anti—Semitlsm
and racism. Butit is unfortunate that nextweek,
most of us will likely stop doing anything to
address the problems we need to be addressing
We haveth tackled the cause of hatred, only the
expression ofit.

There are no easy and ung'iblc solutions to
such diﬁicult issues, and sometimes remain-
ing silent about them is easier than trying to
address them, But lack of dialogue leads to
ignorance, which can quickly degenerate into
subtle and oven: racism and discrirrbinatiou.We
need to be talking about prejudice and raidsm
on a rnicrocosmic level—in our dorm rooms,
over dinner and in class. We need to look each
other in the eye and admit charm/int or without
swastikzs, there are silent tensions and preju-
dices on campus that we need to dixuss with
one another.

Acu'vism on this campus should be more
than just a sudden reaction to speciﬁc events.
The outrage these swastikas triggered contrasts
sharply to the apathy generally so pervasive
on campus. It's good that we were angered by
this, but there are countless other things that
we need to be ﬁghting against—not the least of
which are the underlying prejudices that per-
meate our lives in more ways than mistilsas on
a bathroom wall.

The presence of swastikas reminded us of
how strong symbols can be. But symbols of
resistance and hope can be just as powerful<
such symbols can remind us that prejudice
and racism can only be overcome with uniﬁed
activism If we truly want to address the prob»
lems these sumstikas represent, we will have to
do much more than have one match and one
meeting. We need a movement.
