Bohman, Ochoa
elected to top
SGA offices

For first time in several years,
election doesn’t go into run-off

BY LOLA GARCIA

Student voters broke away liar“ recent tradition
in this year 3 soil election for plesidcnt and vice

- - 'dent oracadom - units by avoiding a

and not electing a retard SGA ad-
ministrative coordinator (AC) to ofﬁce.

This year's AC, Mike Maloney‘Obdost his bid for
the presidency in a one-lound election on Monday
Cownibblc Joint Board senator john Bbhnian ‘06
won a decisive victory, taking 551 votes to‘Malouey’s
308.

The margin of victory in the vice presidential
clcctien was even more signiﬁcant. Loosehead Joint
Board Senator Chris Ochoa ‘06 took 697 votes, beat-
ing East campus Senator Jason Chen ‘07 by over 550
votes.

Write-in candidates took less than ten percent of
thc vote in the presidential election and about 11 per-
cent of the vice presidential election.

For the first tune in recent memory both the
presidential and vice presidential elections had only
two official candidates and neither went into a ruli-
off election, According to the SGA Constitution, ifa
candidate does not receive at least fifty percent oftlic
vote, there will be a second tunroff election, usually
between the top two candidates. In past years, with
students having the Optlon orthree to the candidates,
runroff elections were almost guaranteed,

In another break from recent years, the ACiusur
ally an electoral favorite—was defeated. This year’s
previous vice president Andy Grimm had been an
AC. Liz Allan ‘04, president for the 200372004 aear
demic year, had served as AC the previous year under
President Alejandro Oyarzabal ‘04,who had served as
AC in 2001-2002,

Despite recent history, Maloncy denied that Acs
held any advantage in president and VP elections.
”I'm not really sure the AC has an advantage,"he said,
“if you look farther [than the past three years] that is
not the case,”

Maloney attributed his loss to the strength otthe
opposing candidate rather than to any negative assoe
ciations the student body had with the current SGA
administration. ”John’s a great candidate with a lot of
great ideas,"hc said,“l feel that even though I lost the
election, the student body isn't losing anything."

Bohman attributed his victory to students wanting
more out of the SGA. “I think the students of Grin-
nell know that they are capable ormorc and voted tor
a candidate who will help them realize that potential,"
he said. Bohman ran on a platform ofa “new SGA,”
and said that under his administration SGA would be
“seleassessing and scll'rimproving."

“i hope to achieve greater transparency, greater
engagement with the student body, and greater drive,"
he added that he wanted this effort “not just from
SGA, but from the entire campus community."

He also said he was looking forward to working
with Ochoa, despite the fact that Ochoa had openly
campaigned with Maloney. He said his relationship
would be "a friendly and productive one."

“Chris is someone i have a great respect for," he
said. “He has invested a lot in the campus commu-
nity, and 1 don't think I could have picked a better
VP myself."

Ochoa echoed Bohmau’s optimism. “I think John
and 1 will have a great working relationship" he said.

Early Sunday morning, students in Laeier Hall
found swastikas drawn in black Magic marker on the
shower, mirrors and walls of a first floor bathroom.
Swastikas were also drawn on posters and windows in
the entrance and computer lab.

1n the south campus loggia, swastileas were found
on a Disco ﬂyer and on a campaign poster. A swastika
was also drawn on the door of Nollen House, which
houses the office of the president and other admiri-
istrative ofﬁces. Some students who live offrcampus
reported ﬁnding swastika: drawn at their house, ac
cording to Security

swastikas were ﬁrst sighted
at 2 a.m., said Adam Btumer
‘07, but it took until 10 pm. for
students to organize in response
to the incidents. “It's just odd be-
cause if they were indeed there at
2 o’clock in the morning, and ob
viously ifyolt're going to the balli-
tooth or going to the computcr lab
throughout the day, why wouldn't you take it down ..
or why didn’t you report it?" said Leah Roscnbaum
‘08.

Roscnhaum described her initial reaction as anger.
“Irina [Ushcrenko ‘08] was really upset by it, close to
tears, and I was more angry, because I couldn't believe
that somebody on our campus would actually have the
nerve to do that," she said. “After I found out about
the nationrwide srurr that’s going on, it turned into
more scared, because as a Jewish student, it’s scary
how much antirSemitism there is.”

A couple of hours later the students, including
Brumcr and Roscnbaum, sent an email to campus
groups and individuals calling to “mobilize this came
pus."

“Even irit was just intended as just a crappy joke,
as serious, because it's such a strong hate symbol,”
said Brumer. “And we don’t take it as ajoke.”

“I think there are people on this campus whojust
don’t understand there were people who were really

”Even If/t waS/usl intended as/ust a
crappy/joke, it’s set/nus, because it’s
such t1 strong hate symbol"

hurt and really threatened by that,” said Elena Rubin
‘07. “This is not new on this campus.This is not new
in this world.This is just something that was just add-
ing up."

The appearance of the swastikas triggered an open
forum and a march through campus and town against
prejudice and discrimination, as well as discussion of
ongoing concerns about student and academic life, ts-
pccially racial discrimination and prejudice.

The incidents are currently under investigation
by Security in conjunction with the'Grinnell Police
Department, said Director of Security Steve Briscoe.
Though the intention orthc pcr»
petrators is unknown, theories as

to their motives include white
supremacy,anti-Sernitism,eritis
cism of the college administra—
tion and intoxicatcd attempts at
humor.

The police department
has classiﬁed the vandalism as
hate crimes, or bias-motivated
crimes, which are crim gainst persons or proper-
ty wholly or partly motivated by the offender's bias
against race, religion, disability, ethnicity, national or‘lr
gin or sexual orientation

In an email announcing the irate crimes, security
also announced an allrcampus meeting to be held at
9:15 Monday night in Lazier Hall.The small lounge
on Lazier Third filled to capacity at about 9:10, and
Vice President for Student Services Tom Crady led
the crowd of 1007150 students to the Forum South
Lounge.

Brumer said that they assumed that more students
would attcud than would fit in Lazier, but they started
the meeting in Laeier because “we need to reclaim
that.”

Briscoc began the meeting by giving a synopsis of
information about the incident and a list of possibly
related events. Briscoe speculated that the swastikas
were drawn by someone with P-card access to the
