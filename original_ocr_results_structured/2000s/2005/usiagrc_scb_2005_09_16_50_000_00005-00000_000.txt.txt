Shannon Edwards '07 is an anomaly in Griiiricll's
dance world.

She is a member of both Dance Team and Dance
Troupe,- groups whose smdenr membership does not
traditionally overlap, and spends twelve hours a week
on two entirely different forms of dancing

Both groups draw experienced—and sometimes
inexperienced—dancers who want an oudct for dance,
but for very different reasons,

“Dance Team is entertr‘ningi [while] Troupe is
about showing you something about modern dance,”
said Edwards.

Dance Team was started by Angela Sparks ’04 and
Dree Cullopy ’04 for students who wanted to dance
for rain, while Dance Troupe was born out of a need
for dance in Grinncll's academic curriculum.

In the 1970s, dance classes were a part ofphysical
education,but the theatre department’s two classes on
contemporary dance weren‘t enough for students who
were interested in the technical aspect of dance.

"Dance Troupe is a good supplement to the lack of
technique classes at Grinnell,” said Sarah Davidowitz
’07.Troupe moves past the basics and offers one credit
per semester in the theater department.

Edwards initially signed up for Team at the aCIlV'r
ties fair and was immediately hooked on the informal
group that welcomes anyone who wants to dance.

It took Edwards a little longer to audition for the
more technical Dance Troupe during her sophomore
year after taking one of the theatre department’s can,
temporary dance classes. '

Like many members ofboth groups, Edwards has
been dancing for years.

"I want to do as much dance as possible," she
said.

The Dance Team, which does not require audi-
rions, is 100% student-run and is choreographed in
Grinnell's haven for informal dancing: the Harris
Center. '

”It‘s an amalgamation offive or six different dance
forms: jazz, tap, kick. hip-hop and lyrical," said co-
caprein Niyantri anakrishnan '05. Teams formar
tions are “visual," according to co—captain Besty Root
'06, culminating in a performance at the end of se-
master,

“It’s a lot ofwork for one evening," Root said. "But
the important part is having fun together and dancing
all semester.”

Dance Troupe, led by Shawn Womack, Theatre, is
choreographed by faculty and students in alternating
semesters. This group also ends the semester With a
performance, but not the kind set to the popular mu-
sic traditionally heard in Harris.

Troupc’s focus is on technical, contemporary
dance. "Contemporary is what ‘modern’ has evolved
into,”said Edwards.

Troupe’s structure is also more formal: auditions
are held every semester to keep the Troupe to about
ten dancers, whereas current Team membership is
twenty-five.

Both groups require 'six hours a week from
their members. “The time commitment is a lot for
a Gtinnell student,” said Ramakrishnan. However,
since rheTeam’s performance consists of about seven
different dances, participation is not set in stone.

“You can pick and choose what you want to be in,"
said Brenna Houlihan 'osTronpe is a bigger commit-
ment, said Edwards: “You have to be there."

Despite contemporary dance’s ties to theater,
students from many disciplines want to study dance
technique. '

“When 1 came (0 Grinneii, the majority orTronpe
members were science majors,"said Womack

However, Dance Team would prefer to leave
studying out ofilr “You learn a lot about dancing, bitt
it's about the people and having fun,"said Hoiilihanr
