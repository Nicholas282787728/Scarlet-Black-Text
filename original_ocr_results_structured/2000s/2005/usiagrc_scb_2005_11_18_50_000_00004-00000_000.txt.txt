'Mad hot weddings and heart palpitations

Ten-year-olds shaking their groove thing, two men scoring some ladies and a French gangster playing the piano

Mad Hot Ballroom (PG)

When i was nine, 1 got second place to the boy
i loved in the school spelling bee. This past summer,
that same boy was obsessed with Dmm‘ng mil/l The
Sim-r. If we had combined these two pastimes as chil—
dren, we might have gotten along a lot better and a
lot sooner.

in Mad H02 Ballnmm, New York city public
schools have captured that combination. Competition
and cooperation form the allure of the documentary,
straight out of Brooklyn, Tribeca and Washington
Heights. The ﬁlm focuses on public schools ptactit
ing for the city ballroom competition, as well as on
students and teachers while they are not on the dance
ﬂoor.

Unlike my friends and I, who were trying to prove
our mastery of simple English, the elementary school
students in MadHur Bid/mam learn the thrilling 1m,
guage of ballroom dancing. Teachers force the boys
and girls to work together. As it turns out, the girls are
often taller and more in control, and the boys fumble
as they ﬁnd ways to avoid touching their partners,
eventually getting the hang of it.

or course, as the movie-going public has long
known, dancing is never just dancing. Herc, it’s about
kids growing up, learning how to work together and,
from a Grinnelllan standpoint, learning about class
and gender roles. Especially in a New York City pub-
lic school, ballroom dancing provides a poignant al
ternative for learning about interaction between the
sexes, and we see the students become aware of this as
the ﬁlm goes on. on a larger level, the ﬁlm focuses on
children learning to be proud of themselves for doing
something unique and the struggles they encounter
on the way.

Since it's about a competition, Ballroom also asks
us to look at the teachers, their methods and the at
titudes they instill in the children. One teacher takes
all her girls out to get matching clothing and speaks
candidly about her stagermotherresque need to win
the biggest trophy. Aside from ten-year-olds, there
are also some really sweet male teachers who wow
the audience with their dedication to dance. Later in
the film, after seeing the teachers tackle their prob
lems, we see the alternative: a fascist, perfect-posture
teacher from a school with more resources and less
soulfulness.

Then we get down to the nitty-gritty: the guts and
glory of elementary school competition. After dwdl-
ing on and growing attached to three unique schools,
we cheer them on through various rounds oreompes
tition that end at the Winter Garden of the World
Financial Center. The talent of the students and the
drama of the competition made me want to giggle,
sympathetic to the participants' awkward, youthful
dedication.

The Beat That My Heart
Skipped (unrated)

This summer was good for the international gang-
ster film. And, while the British Lay/Ir Cal's may have
gotten more U.S. attention, FICnChTm‘rIClB Th Bear
lh/Il My Hem-l Slipped is a fine gangster film equally
deserving of attention. Aside from that, it has little in
common with Layzl Calm More ﬁtting comparisons
could be made to Truffaut’s Show [/16 Piano Player or
Scorsese’s Mum Smelt, for this film is in many ways a
character study within the gangster setting.

The story follows Thomas, a welledressed thug
with an identity crisis. As his “real estate" business be
gins to falter, Thomas begins to chase the fantasy of
becoming a concert pianist, in emulation of his dead
mother. As a college student, I related well to these
questions of worthwhile life pursuits. And, while
Thomas may be lusting for a higher calling, he doesn't
fail to leave in all the good gangster bits that make any
ﬁlm compelling. In between intense brooding and an-
gry piano playing, Thomas makes sure to leave rats in
apartments,l.ight kitchens on fire and generallyinﬂict
a lot orphysical pain.

Overall, the ﬁlm succeeds at making us identify
with Thomas and creating an intense, uncomfortable
feeling. The director here has always chosen shaky
over slick, which is not a bad decision. The overall efa
fect is a very interesting, emotionally gripping story.

The Wedding Crashers (R)

Based on its name alone, Tl): Wedding Cmrbm
seems destined tojoin many ofits highsconccpt com,
edy predecessors in cinema hell. However, due to a
great leading duo and well-executed raunchiness, the
ﬁlm manages to turn a ridiculous premise into one of
the better, and more financially successful, comedies
of the

Jeremy Klein (played by a typically manic Vince
Vaughn) and John Beckwith (Owen Wilson' in full
sweet-talking surfer mode) are divorce mediators who
crash weddings with the dual (and rarely mutually ex—
clusive) aims of getting laid and having a good time.
They have wedding crashing nearly down to a scis
ence, with elaborately constructed false personas and
a set of wedding crashing “rules” that allow them to
successfully crash Jewish, Irish and Hindu weddings
alike, with predictably hilarious results.

In the free-ﬂowing first ha]! of the film, Vaughn
and Wilson are in their element and have tremendous
comedic chemistry. However, when they decide to
crash the “Kentucky Derby ofweddings," the nuptials
ota prominent politician William Cleary’s (played by
an underutilized Christopher Walken) daughter, the
film slows down and loses some of its edge. At the

wedding both John and Jeremy become romantically
entangled with Cleary's other daughters (Rachel Mc-
Adams and a delightfully deranged Isla Fisher) and
end up securing an invitation back to the Cleary fame
Ily compound, where a weekend of hilarity ensues.
As the film leaves its witty and bawdy origins for
a more general romantic comedy, the outrageous nae
ture of its premise becomes somewhat burdensome.
Nonetheless, the talent of Vaughn and Wilson man—
ages to keep the film aﬂoat. Many critics have righdy
hailed m Wedding crowed as the triumphant return
of the Rrrated comedy. Bare breasts and offacolor hue
mot do abound, but the movie is ultimately successful
not because of its raunchincss but because it plays to
the strengths of its leading men. Director David Dobe
kin gives Vaughn and Wilson the freedom to play off
each other and the result is a pair of performances
that improve nearly every other aspect of the film.
Tb: Wedding Crdrderr is, if nothing else, a good
time. The ending may be cliched and some of the
jokes a bit revolting, but the film features high-qual-
ity presentation of lowbrow comedy and two of H017
lywood’s funniest comic actors.
