The non-winning teams were not

the A team finished near the middle

Grinnell‘s ever played since I’ve been
here,” he said.

The women's team ﬁnished lower

Football team goes to the air to beat Macalester

av KEVIN BVRNE

After 50 minutes, 154 plays and 872 yards, the
dust finally settled and a team emerged victorious.
The Grinnell College Pioneers came out on top last
Saturday, edging their way past the Macalester Scots,
31-23.

It was a close contest but the Pioneers were up
to their usual tricks, scoring big in the fourth quarter
With several clutch performances from a handful of
Pioneers.

The only scoring ofthe first quarter came off the
for ofkicker Bud BIIunIgartner '07 on a 287yard field

oal.
g The second quarter was a bit more action-packed,
with both teams combining for I total of 23 points.
Grinnell scored on a run by Clarence “CJ”MoOIe ’09
from 12 yards out to make the score 10-0.The Scots
answered with a field goal and a touchdown, but failed
to convert the point after touchdown.

After Kyle Perry ‘08 hauled in II pass from Sean
Pfalzer'07 from 27 yards out fol another touchdown,
the Pioneers Weill into the locker room at halftime

leading 1779.

“The O-line did a greatjob of getting to the pe-
rimeter of the defense and tangling up Macalester‘s
linebackers," said tailback Lance Ellrkholder ’08,"but
a lot of key blocks were also made by receivers and
backs."

Burklaolder led the rush att1ck in both halves for
the Pioneers offense, racking up 99 yards on 25 car7
ries His steady ground production gave quarterback
Pfalzer time to find open receivers duling the second
half. PfIlaer found Perry once again forascore and hit
Marcus Plouzek 09 with a 697 yard touchdown pass
to put Grinnell In the lead for good.

Aftel a Macalester touchdown In the fourth quar-
ter, two Grinnell defensive stops led by Leo Martin
'06 scaled the 31723 victory for the Pioneers.

Martin was a very stlong defensive presence on
Satulday, finishing the game with 20 tackles and a
sack,

“I think the defense plIwcd fairly solIt s Iid line7
backei Blert Maloney '09, who had two *5 of his
own last Saturday. “Their offensive numbers were

rather high biit when it came down to crunch time we
did what we had to do. About 70 of their yards came
on a reverse flea ﬂicker, but the rest was mainly short
to intermediate length plays,"

Although Maloney was satisfied with the defense
he felt they could have performed better. “We played
well, but look for the defense to step it up more next
week and hold Illinois College to much less than 400
yards and 23 points."

Illinois College is coming to Grinnell this Satur-
day tor a 1:30 pm, game. The Blueboys are currently
171 overall with a record of071 in the Midwest Con7
feIenee. _

Grinnell lost only one game at home last year and
will be looking to defend their home turf once again
this weekend.

“We have to continue to woik on execution on
both sides of the ball," said Defensive Coordinator
Tim Hollibauglr “On defense, the hig plav continues
to hurt us. On offense, penalties in clutch situations
ale proving to be oul tle ‘e. If we can take clue of
these two things, we no going to play hetter football."
