Emily Matkovitz has never
gotten a speeding rickct, and it’s
not because she drives slowly.

“I don’t get speeding tickets
because cops think 1 have can
car, and it doesn't bother me that
cops assume that, but it makes
me feel bad sometimes, having
people tell me about losmg their
prostate and things like that, are
a little awkward," Markovitz
said.

She has an autoimmune dis
ease called alopecia, which in
Latin literally means lackofha'ir.
Markovitz got the disease when
she was three, and ever since has
had no hair on her body,

Matkovitz notes cheerfully
that she often gets asked why
she is bald, but that it doesn't
bother hert She has a remark-
ably good sense ofhumot about
having :llopccia and talks about
it easily

Explaining that there is no
known reason for alopecia, Mare
kovttz notes that sometimes it is
caused by stress, but says that
probably wasn’t the cause in her
case because three-year-olds
aren’t very stressed out.

“It wasn’t like, ‘Oh no Moms
my, the dog moved!’ and 1 lost
all my hair," she joked.

Matkovit1 says she often has
people ask her irshe is a survi-
vor, meaning a cancer survivor,
and she says it's hard to think of
a tactful responset

“I kind of feel like I should
somehow know what to say, but
in not good with people,” she
said. “They’ll ask me if [I'm] a
survivor, I’m like, ‘no shit, I've
survived nothing.”

But Matkovitz is too busy
to let the disease bother her,
especially because there are no
adverse side effects.

“I don’t remember having
hair, so it's always been kind of
the same,” she said. “It's kind of
hard not to be used to it."

After graduation, Markovtiz
plans to work on an island oft
the coast of New Hampshile,
and after that she will likely
move to Denver for awhile to

seriously, I just have a general
interest in technical theatre, sct

Markovtiz has also acted in
several productions, including
The Marian, Waiting fat Godot
and last semester’s Lai‘MummJ,
but says that she doesn’t aim to
make it a career.

“I have trouble taking most
things seriously, 1 just think it's
more ofa personal love of it. I
feel like I get a lot of a senpt
