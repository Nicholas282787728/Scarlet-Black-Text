THE INTRODUCTION

The five iesidents of1205 Broad
St. spend most oftheii time debat-
ing the most serious of topics; for we
ample. they attempt to assign everyr
one in the house special roles. “We're
like Sex mid the City. JJ. gets to be
Stanford, Rose gets to be Saman-
tha," Borkan said. Oliver disagrees,
interrupting with “Wait, I would not
be Stanfoid. I would be Charlotte’s
friend, the gay guy."Thc girls try to
figure out who the character is and
speculate for several minutes, until
someone remembers. “Yeah, the really
Jewish guy," Borkaii said. The group
has been friends since their first year-
at Grinnell. when three of the girls
lived in the same dorm, and J J. and
Rose were self-described groupies.
The friends have all dated many or
the same people and have proved that
the “house is livuig testimony to the
incestuous web or Grinnell," Wilson
said.

The Name

“The Four Breads and a Boy"
name is not unanimously agreed upon.
“There’s still contention about the
name,” Borknn saidThe current name
originated from an e-mail sent out for
a party. “jamic was writing an email,
and just made it up,”Wilson said. “We
needed something to call ourselves."
Most, however, know the house by
another unique feature: only three or
its sides are painted, “People in town
know it as ‘that house. They’ re like,
oh yeah, that house that's only painted
on three sides." Golden said

The Guests

The house has had several unwel-
come visitors while the residents have
had the house,“We have hats," Borkan
saidThe small Cieiitllres ﬂy in through
the eaves and terrify the resident, I
trapped one in noolt,"Wi .on s;
shut the doois and let it ﬂy around all
night.”Tivo bi ' have be i dealt with
since then illi

 

by a friend. “We tried to save it. it was
over the door and 1 opened the door
and it just sat there," Then it started
ﬂying in the other direction. We threw
balls at it to make it go out,” Borkan
said while her house mates laughed.
“You can't touch it, it'll just start ﬂying
in the other directionl"

The Change

Their humble abode has under-
gone other changes as well. “It's never
been a house before,” Borkan said. “I
don’t think the people have known
each other.”The newest residents have
had to work on cleaning the house up,
espeeially the upstairs. The previous
residents were “a hnneh or duty boys,"
according to Wilson, “We have people
come and try to retrace their steps be
cause they dont even re Iszc thevre in
the same apartment, Golden said. The
house itself has been around since the
early 1900s, complete with little nooks
and lead paint. “They had to repaint the
outside because it was all lead paint,"
Hollificld said. “When we ﬁrst came
here, we each got a little booklet about
how lead paint is poisonous and we
shouldn‘t eat it." Golden agreed: “Yeah,
we try not to eat the paint chips on the
ground. It's hard."

The Danish

Grinneil's far-reaching alumni sys-
tem has outdone itself when it comes
to Four Broads and a Boy. “We've been
getting anonymous postcards from
Denmark,"13oritin said. “People claim-
ing that they used to live in our apartr
ment."Aceording to Wilson, they start
ed coming the first week ofschool, and
the second one arrived about aweck and
a half lateri But there is a plus side to
having eontaets with random Grinnell
alums in a foreign eonntiy. “They say
that they'll reimburse out next party if
we send them the receipt,"\’Vilson saidi
oteoutse for every yin there is a yang
and the Danish alums occasionally
share more than the residents want to
know “They've also told us about peer
stuns they left on the eupet, which is
always good to knaw,”\Vilson said,“lt’s
a mystery ot’our house.”
