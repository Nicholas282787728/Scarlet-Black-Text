Coke debate

SGA resolution, failed initiative

leave student position unclear

av KATIE lAREs

When Jenny Dale '06 was younger her parents
“took a rwo—ycar-old and a four-year—oid to live in a
war zone.”

For four years ofher life, Dale lived in El Salvador
amid that nation’s civil war, She says her experience
led to a deep shared connection to Latin America.
Years later, her father went to Colombia.

Her father's reports moved Dale. rhen a junior, ro
help organize last year’s CocacCola boycott With the
Latln American Solidarity Group (LASG).

“As a consumer on a campus that supported Coca
Cola exclusively this is one small, lirrle thing 1 can
do,” she said, "Corporations have a lot ofpower in the
world they need to take responsibility."

Dale and LASG wrote and advocated the Cocos
Cola resolution through Joint Board this year. At least
20 percent of the student body must vote in favor, in
addition to a SGA resolution, for a boycott to go into
effect. The SGA standards for student initiatives are
different. In order for an initiative to pass, 50 percent
of students must vote, and twocthirds of student votes
must be in favor of an initiative. only 55 percent of
students who voted cast their votes in favor of the Nov.
9 student
initiative to
boycott Coke.
The initiative
failed.

The im—
pact of last
year’s Coca
Cola boycott
was hody
debated on
campus and Plans Proponents of the boycott say last
year's boycott caused a 40 percent decrease in Coke
consumption on campus.

“The reduction was more like four percent," said
Director of Dining Services Dick Williams. “There
was some effecr on fountain synip and in the vending
area." Still, both Williams and John Kalkbrenner, vice
president of college services, said local Coca»Cola
employees took notice,

“The managers at CocacCola were quite con,
cerned about the boycott. Last year they sent rep-
resentatives from a number of Coke entities to visit
campus and talk with a group ofsrudenrs, faculty and
staf ," said Kalklorenner. “I believe that they sent a (or
rrl of seven managers from such locations as Ames
Iowa, Coke headquarters in Atlanta and from Coca-
Cola FEMSA in Costa Rica."

Since more than 20 percent of students did Sllp’
port a CocacCola boycott, there could be a debate
over whether stickers announcing the boycott should
go back up on tounrain dispensers and machines.

Though rhcrc is no certainty about whether boys
cott stickers will go up, Coke alternatives are available
in dining halls and the Forum. Tea, coffee, milk, V8
juices, most fruit energy drinks sold in Forum Ex-
press and any beverage at Bob’s Underground Cafe
are noneCoke brands,

Williams hoped that confrontation can be avoidv
ed.“l do notwish to get caught between the two sides
of this issue," he said. “I would prefer for the student
groups and SGA [ro] resolve differences amongsr the
student body."

”i do not Wish to gel taught
between {he lwo sides of this

Students may find getting their mail in the Campus Center next

Hordes of impatient students shoulder their way
past each other, brushing against ajury-rigged fence
of chicken wire. A line stretches up a staircase, par
tially blocking the main door, as students wait to get
their packages. Most Grinnellians go through this
scene on a regular basis in the post office tucked b5,
neath Carnegie Hall.

When the post office, like many other college ser-
vices, moves into the Joe Rosenficld
’25 Campus Center next year, the
cramped space appears to open. up.
But students and staff are concerned
about how changes could af-

“I’ve heard the post ofe
fice is not designed by ‘post
office guys,” said Andrea ;‘ —
Mattcr'07."Tlic ﬁrst thing i
is that it must be designed ,l
as a post office not just re
a pretty thing."

The new post office
is a “functional space," according ro Tom Crady, vice
president ofStudent Affairs "It will be much bigger,
nicer and has more storage," he said. “The window
is much bigger, and the ﬂoor-to-ceiling mailboxes will
make it easier for srudenr accessxThe new posr office
has an ATM and two entrances,
one facing toward South Campus
and one into the Center.

Currently, professors have
their mail delivered to them in

post office moving away from the
academic buildings, processors and
scoff members worry that this could change.

"The staff brings the mail up to me and it's ac-

Mail?

he had heard that some faculty members would have
their mailboxes in the Campus Center. According to
Vice President of College Services John Kalkbrcnncr,
mail deliveries to faculty will continue, “If a faculty
member feels strongly about having a mailbox in the
Campus Center, [we] can work with that," he said.

Crady hoped that many professors would choose
to get their mail with students. "It would be great to
have people come to the Center," said Cindy. “We
want it to be a vibrant place
[that] encourages inter-
action."

Support staff worried
that sending large packv
ages would become more
diﬁicult with the new loca-
tion. “The problem is with
getting mail out,“ said Acac

demic Support staff mem—
ber Karen Groves, whose
office is in Carnegie “if
we have overnighr dec
livery and packages, we
can’tjust go downstairs any more."

Some students and staff are looking forward
to the new post office. “The post office sometimes
floods,” said Adam Barrett ’08. “When I worked as a
dispatcherl kept getting these calls that water collects
cd because of a huge rain storm
since it's in a basement below
ground level," The new posr of
fice is raised above the ground.

Ed Phillips, Classics, is also
looking forward to the change.
“[The currenr post orfice] is
cramped and difficult to get in and
out of," he said.

“I think it will be a good transition," Kalltbrenner
said. “ [A] nicer facility, bigger space, because students
will ship u lot of things in rhe fall and spring from
homc.Thcre will be more light and it will be cleaner,”
