Disorders Awareness Week; some
college staff members report in-
crease in eating disorders on campus

On a campus rhar prides itscltnn an assumption that stu-
dents love their own bodies, addressing body issues can he dirfi-
cult for those who srrnggle with them, especially for those who
suffer from fulleblown caring disorders.

“The fact that only three students show up to a discussion
indicates that it's still such a taboo subject," said Alissa Briggs
‘05, an organizer for this year's Eating Disorders Awareness
Week.

The week's events, 5 onsored by the Student Health and
Wellness Committee ( HAW), included a Tuesday round-
rable discussion on eating disorders, yoga on Wedneday and a
movie and discussion entitled Eating Dim'dn's and (/Jr- Family
on Thursday.

Though some of this week’s events had low turnouts, this
year there has been a “spike [in] people coming forward saying
they’re concerned about their friends and people selfridcnrifyr
ing" as having eating disorders on campus, said Briggs, Karen
Cochran, director of health sertlices, agreed that more incidents
ofeating disorders have been reported to her this year than in
the past few years.

“It's been more frequent with men that we've seen before,"
said Tom Crady, vice president for student services.

An increase in reporred incidents and seltridenriﬁcations
do not necessarily indicate a higher incidence of eating dis
ders on campus, however. “Sometimes it’s a random thing,"sard
Cochran.“It depends on who comes to me to report it.”

Lisa Bard of the Poweshiek County Mental Health Center, _

pointed to a gradual change over the years. “At first it was difr
frculr to talk about, bur people really wanted to help," she said.
“Now there's a culture ofheing really, really thin. It has become
more normalized, because we used to be able to generate more
discussion and more concern."

Briggs and her boyrriend Paul Dufrm ‘05 have been in
volved in raising awareness ofeating disorders on campus since
their sophomore year, when they started Healthy Body, Healthy
Mind as an “informal peer support group," Briggs said, The
group later merged with SHAW.

“I'd been in remission first year, and i had a really strong
base ofpeer support at home, and i felt there was a lack ofthnt
here," said Briggs. “My friends and my boyfriend were absor
lutely clueless. They just hadn’t been educated about it, and if
they had it was the same scnsationalized health class videos.”

Starting Healthy Body, Healthy Mind helped provide
Briggs with an informal peer support network, and an academic
project in which she used herself as a case study was another
imporranr part of her recovery from bulimia.

Though college studenrs are already among those most
likely ro suffer from an eating disorder, a prestigious residential
institution like Grinnell has its own set of factors that affect

incidents oteating disorders on campus.

Those considered to be at high risk are often characterized
as over—achievers and perfectionisrs. “We have the demograph-
ics rhat suggest high numbers of this kind of behavior," said
Dufﬁn.

Briggs characterized Grinnell as a “high-stress, high-pres-
sure environment,"but she cited Grinnell’s “close-knit commu-
nity" as a plus. “It's a little more difﬁcult to hide, especially in a

get process,” said Brand. “The budget process is not where the
battles are supposed to occur," Rather, he said, they are supposed
to occur in master planning.

The primary way that faculty input is heard is through the
non-decision-maldng Budget Steering Committee, which in
cludes several administrators and deans, as well as two faculty and
two students, according to Wayne Moyer, Political science, chair
of the faculty and member of the committee.

"The Budget Steering Committee is more ofan information
advisory committee. It has the opportunity to mercise some in—
put—v‘We'd like to do more of this and more of that‘—but we
don't take a vote on it,"Moyer said. Still, “the question as I see it
is [whether] the faculty [should] have more influence in setring
overall priorities, not making the actual decisions." Moyer believes
that they should.

Nevertheless, according to Schneider, “the amount of faculty
input into the total budget has increased over the past decade."
Moyer agrees, although not all professors do.

“The faculty doesn't have the say in the general budget that it
used to,”Daniel Kaiser, history, said, pointing to a time abour 25
years ago when the faculty Executive Council exercised irnrnedi»
are influence on the president. “In a college like the onel imagine,
the enterprise oflcarning is a cooperative one [in which] the face
ulty is integrally connected" to the workings otrhe college.

Capital Reserve Fund

One major long-term men of contention is the Capital Reserve
Fund, a rrusreer and president-controlled account that provides
budget stability among market ﬂuctuations. The fund, which is
currently funding the various construction projects on campus,
is spent on special projects that don’t require an even stream of
money each year.

Currently, according to Brand, otthe 4.25 percent taken from
the endowment every year, at least 1.25 percent goes to the Capi-
rai Reserve Fund, while the remaining portion goes to the base
budget, which funds personnel, fuel and other everyday costs.

The fund's lack of openness has met with some resistance
among faculty In response to Standifer’s assertion that trustees
sought to focus on salary issues during their most recent visit, Kai-
ser identiﬁed the Capital Reserve Fund as an issue rhat ought to
be debated.

“I think $100 million plus in buildings is a good leverage point
to discuss,” Kaiser said.“It’s a good srraregy by the trustees to push
it off the table, but I don’t think that's fair. These decisions were
not subjected to the same discussion as the rest of the budget."

In about five years, much of the major construction on campus
will be ﬁnished, and new questions will arise about how the fund
should be used.

“There will be an enormous amount of pressure to spend that

“It can be hard to get a handle on who has an eating disorder
and when it can be called an eating disorder,"said Cochran.

Briggs encouraged students who may be concerned for their
friends to “ﬁnd ways ofcaring that don’t involve food ...Just be
a resource, but be nonreonfrontational,” she said.

Crady encouraged concerned students to visit walk-in
mental health services. “It’s a very secretive i1lness,"he said. “It

money, and I’m fearful that bad decisions will be made,"Schneider
said. “I personally believe that tuition, or better yet, aggressive fl»
nancial aid would be a more efrective way to spend that money."

Additionally, Moyer said that, “the faculty’s hope is that at
least a large portion of the money will go into the academic bud-
get,” in order to expand programs for students.

“I think that there are real beneﬁts in making an attractive
campus where students want to come, but I think it’s time to
make a switch," Moyer said.

Because the deusionrmaking for the fund is done behind
closed doors and is not open to public discussion, few students
and faculry know much about it.

“We don’t talk enough about it,” Schneider said. “Few faculty
really understand how [it] works and why we have [it]."

Faculty budget awareness

in general, according to Moyer, faculty members don't widely
discuss budgetary issues at meetings, pardy due to a lack ofeasily—
accessible information. “lfyou push for information you can get a
good bit, but you have to make an effort to get it,"Moycr said.

Moreover, according to Kaiser and Moycr, some faculty mem
bers, especiady newer protessors, find it unnecessary for faculty ro
be involved in any budget issues but those that are directly rele-
vant to their teaching. Like nearly everything budchelated, said
Kaiser “there are divided opinions on this.”
