Admissions

Dean of Admissions said class is most selective ever due to
smaller class size and more applicants, but is much more diverse

By DAVID MONTGOMERY

Next year's incoming first-year class looks a bit
different than the past several years. For starters, it's
much smalleriappl' ately 380 students, accord
ing to Dean ofAdmi lOliSJlm Sumner. It’s also more
diverse, with moie than 20 percent of the class self-
idcnrifyrng as students otcolor

“The freshman class is intentionally smaller than
the past two years, said Sumner. The past two years,
we vc aimed for about 410 and ended up around 440
This you we set a goal ofabour 385 first years

As a result of the smaller class size, coupled with
a continued rise in applications to Grinnell, Sumner
says that this year’s admissions were the most selective
in the college’s history,

Griiiiiell, likc othei colleges, has a mathematical
model used to estimate how many accepted students
will choose Grinncll.That model hasn’t been .I very
accurate piedictor of yield over the past two years,
howcvcl.

“We took a look at the people who had applied:
they came from frrrrhcr away, they had better grades,
they had better test scores, they had more money, they
applied to more colleges, and they were more ethni-
cally di\lcrsc,"snid Sumnerf‘Wc looked at those things
and thought, ‘Wow, the number who say yes to us is
going to decline.’ So we admitted more students, and
the number who said yes actually [went trpl."

Sumner credits the higher yield to the college's
rising reputation. “we do market research, so we
know that our reputation is improving,” said Sumner,
though the college's market research is limited by cost
to a few large metropolitan areas.

At the same time that Grinncll has become more
selective,it has also become nioie diveise. Due in pait
to the college's corrtlrrucd association with the Posse
program, thc next class is more ethnicallv diverse than
the curient student hotly. Final number are uncertain
at this point, but Sumner said he expects well nioie
than 20 percent of new domestic students to be stu-
dents of color.

“We‘ve been intentionally attacking the problem
ordiversity," said srrmner. He cited the example ofa
summer program run by the college where Grrnnell
professors teach science to minority students In the
past, we vc assumed that they ll trill iii love with the
place and come here but now we re heing much more
intentional [in I'ccrtiiting]," Sllmncr said

The numbcro itternutional students will decline,
compalcd to the class of 2003. Sumner said that the
college is simply returning to its historical levels or
foreign enrollment after a very large inter-national
class this past year.

Dcsprre rhc increasing selectivity oi‘ Grinnell,
Sumner dcu‘lcd claims that the college risked becom-
ing more clitist.“1scc those fears as being unfounded,"
he said. “Our commitment to the neediest students
has never been greater. If you look at the amount of
money wc’ll spend on neodrhased aid this year, all
increase greater than the pricc"of the school.

Sumner said that the college’s continued commit—
ment to need-blind admissions and the faculty-de-
signed admissions forrrrula will continue to combine
to get the most “academically superior people" to are
tend.

West Coast education cuts

forced recruiting changes

By DAVID MONTGOMERY

Over the past several years, ﬁve West Coast
states—Californra, Colorado, Oregon, Washing
ton and Alizonu—I'Iavt: placed caps on the amount
of property raves that can go towards education. As
a result, Dean of Admissions lim Sumner says that
west coast high school quality has been “somewhere
between a little bit ofa decline and a free-fall."This
has led the Adinisslons department to change some of
their more traditional recruiting methods in order to
meet more students.

Ordinarily, Admissions tries to arrange for college
counselors to sit high schools.where they meet with
prospecnve students. However, due to budget cue
backs, sumner said that many high schools don’t have
the counseling, li‘to arrange vi 5.

“The question .lrow do rve get to the great snr
dcnts?"SIImncr said. “One thrrrg is a huge direct mail
and clectronic mail campaign. But it’s also good to
meet face to face"

Sumner said that one strategy he s increasingly us
ing is shifting meetings from schools to hotels. “I llgo
to the west, ient a hotel room and invite five alums.I
then invite all the interested students and parents to
come, give a PowerPoint presentation, and have the
alums tell their story."

Grinnell’s peer colleges, according to surnncr,
often have “feeder schools," making recruiting easy.
Grinnell, howevei, doesn't draw large numbers of
students from any particular high school. Because of
this, Sumner said, “We have to rely on methods of
communication other thanjust the traditional school
visits."
