Cech

him out!

Gmnneutruﬁee,Nobeleze
winner and Howard Hughes
Medical Institute president
Thomas Cech ‘70 will speak
about the enzymatic activity
of RNA this weekend

Dr. Thomas Cech ‘70 (pronounced "Check") is
probably best known on campus for being Grinnell’s
only Nobel Prize winner (Chemistry, 1989). But in
the decade and at half since the Royal Swedish Acadr
emy of Sciences honored him, Cech has moved on to
other notable projects. He is currently the president of
the Howard Hughes Mcdical Institute (HHMI), the
secondrlargest nonsproﬁt organization in America.
Cech, a Grinnell College Trustee, will be on campus
this weekend for the trustee’s meeting on Friday, and
will give a talk on Saturday,

(L What is your talk on Saturday going to be
about?

A: It's going to be about the discovery that RNA
can have enzymatic activity. It’ll be both a review of
the discovery that lwas given the Nobel Prize for, but
also a continuation.

Q What research have you done since winning
the Nobel Prize?

A: For a long period of time
we were dedicated to figuring out
the mechanism, how it worked.
We wanted to understand what
happened to each atom, and how
it was possible that RNA could
speed up a chemical reaction by
such a high amount and with such
specificity. This is a reaction that
takes place in a millisecond. If it
were not catalyzed, it would take
a few hundred years.

@Who is fundingyour re-
search?

A: Both the Howard
Hughes Medical Institute
and the National Institutes of
Health.

Q What does your role as
presidentofrhe Howard Hughes
Medical Institute entail?

A: We have a 314 billion endowment, which we
run out ofonr headquarters in Washington, Dc. We
also do human resources, legal, finance and purchas-
ing. l—lalfofthc job is similar to running, say, General
Electric. We’ve got about 300 employees at headquan
rers, mostly not‘rscientists.

The other half is science— and education-ori-
ented, devising new piograms, making decisions
about whether current programs are working as
well as they could. and bringing the people that we
fund together in vibrant new ways. lfwe just fnnd
some good work at some university, we feel that al-
though that’s okay, we feel that we’ve failcd because
we haven't added anything to the mixture, We only
feel that we’ve been successful if we make the whole
bigger than the sum ofrhe parts, and bring different
people together.

(L How does one become a HHMI Investignr
tor?

A: you have to be nominated by your university.
We have competitions ivlicrc we ask 200 top nnivci»
sities, medical schools, and research institutions to
nominate their best people, We'll convene panels of

”/fo student’s only going to take
one or two science classes in than

to be memorable!”

experts who are not themselves funded by the insti-
tute, and have them give us advice about which are
the bcsr [ptospccts].Wc want those who ate the most
innovative and have the best part oftheit careei ahead
of them, but also someone who might particularly
respond to the extra infusion of ﬂexible support for
their work.

We actually employ oui investigators; it’s not a
granr.There's some work to be done in making them
Howard Hughes employees. making them comply
with our standards. We fund them and their research
for five years at a time, and then they come up for a
revtew.

The HHMI
grant

The Howard Hughes
Medical Institute
(HHMI), or which Thom-
as Cech '70 is president,
has given Gn'nnell 52.7
million in grants since
1988, including $14
million in 2004. What

QHow is the HHMI trying to improve science does that money pay
education in America? for?

A: Well, today science is taught in a way that
makes it seem either inaccessible or boiing. The irony
is that the way scientific research is done is completely
transformed from the way it was done ten years ago,

and another planet from wherc it
was 50 years ago. But what hap—
pens in the classroom is often the
same as where it was 50 or even
100 years ago We want to improve
science education for majors and
nonrn‘lajols alike.

It'a student's only going to take
one or two scicncc classes in their
careers, wouldn’t you want them to
be memorable? on the flip side,

if you think you’re going to be

a science major. you're often less

interested in majoring after
taking college-level courses
than when you began, We're
driving kids away from their
natural love of science.

There's a natural inclination
for most kids to want to be in»
terested in science, but a school
system that succeeds in drin
ing this interest out of them is
counterproductive. We ate try-

ing to seed many pockets of excite»

ment around the country We are seeing
that this has an effect bcyond just the places whcrc we
provide funding

0‘; would you say Grinnell's science education
is like the general state you just described?

A: Not to be Pollyannarishd think it's an example
of a better education. It’s especially because of the
faculty, their Willingness to engage students at every
level, not just in class but in then laboratories, for ads
vice at all different levels,

QVVhat’s your most memorable class at Grin—
nell?

A: Freshman humanities, taught by john Cros-
sct. lrlc w. a very conscrvativc professor during vcry
ii nil times on campus, rhc Vietnam \Nar cra. He
taught cla cs using the Socratic teaching method. It
was so different from what I had iii high school and
was vciy important in my dcvclopmcnr as a wit -.
onc ofthc most important things as a scientist is to
write well.

the life

Brian Perbix,

Prospective
Student

8:58 AM. Waking up at 7 am is
starting to seem like a bad idea right
about now. However, the reception’s
continental breakfast proves to be
worth it: having spent Thursday
lunchless and scrounging for veggies
at Quad (I’m of the 0/L persuasion),
bagels and cream cheese are amazing.
Though the ceremony is marred by
tragedy as I manage to spill my orr
ange juice all over the table, I do get
to make friends with other prospies.

10 AM. As we scurry out of the Harris
Center to the next box on the sched»
ule, my complimentary tote bag leaves
me of its own accord (really, I don’t
know what possessed it t“).

3:14 PM. First trip ever to a col-
lege bookstore and I leave before I
can make up my mind to buy some—
thing While there, I run into Heidi, a
prospie from Vermont. We sit outside
in the grass for a few hours saying
things like, ”Wow. This feels like col-
lege." Oh yeah, cheap sentimentality.
I also notice that Iowa squirrels are
damn friendly compared to their cous-
ins in tha ’Nati.

9:38 P.M. Earlier in the day, I’d met
various Joshes and Anands (actually
only two), and I run into them again
a little after dinner. It turns out that
they are musically inclined, and be-
fore long, I go with the two of them
and prospie Sarah up to the loggia,
To jam! Well, that’s not entirely true.
The jamming is left mostly up to Josh,
keyboarder (Mark? Sorry if no ...),
and cross countryerunning trombone
playeri And, as an addendum to Heir
di’s musings, standing on the roof in
the middle of Iowa at night listening
to a keyboard—trombone rendition of
”Jump” deﬁnitely feels like college.

12 A.M. I can’t say it’s my first time
but donning a skirt and dancing for
hours at the Mary B. James dance still
strikes me as something altogether
different. While this may owe to my
never going to a dance in high school
(I’m one of those), Ithink there really
was something exceptional going on
here. Apart from it being a certifiably
trunk affair.

i A.M. My night and prospie visit wind
down in the wee hours and sparse
tables of Bob’s. Here I consume a
number of cheese bagels to sustain
me on what will be my ﬁnal adventure
at Grinnell: the hike back to North
Campus to find my pants. Thanks to
Emma and Walter, and everyone else I
didn't mention!
