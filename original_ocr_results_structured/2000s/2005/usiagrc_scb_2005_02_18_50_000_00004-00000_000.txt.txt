Team America: World Police (R)

The satirical geniuses behind Saul/2 Part, Trey Parker and
Matt Stone, decided to rake a break from their paper ctltnouts
and try their hand at a more sophisticated art form: puppetry.
Ti’mll/Imei'rm: WarldPa/ite strives to be Slim/J Park with puppets
and blood, as well as a biting commentary on the state ofaction
movies, movie star activism and American foreign policy That
list could as likely comprise a sociology thesis as a marionette
movie, but the latter is certainly funnier.

Team Jnltrim is, you guessed it, a secret world police force
set up to stop terrorists and blow stuff up. However, when more
stealth is needed, they bring in Gary Johnston, one ofBroadt
way’s finest actors, to go undercover by, yes, putting on a turban
and fake heard to inﬁltrate a terrorist cell.]ohnston’s story leads
the police to the lair of Kim Jong ll, North Korea's bespectacled
dictator, who has a cunning plan to take over the world.

Team America’s aims are simple and extreme. Show lots of
puppet blood and violence—check. Mock celebrity activists by
making absurd puppets and voices mimicking their likenesses
icheck. Offend the political right and the left equlillyimoslr
ly check. Entertain the audience—not quite check.

All of the peaks and pitfalls of Saul/1 Park are visible in Tin/n
Amnim. Parker and Stone have strangely comedic voices that,
coupled with their boundary~shirking senses of humor and
clever song writing, are often an incredible package. They tack-
le contemporary issues, here mostly out government's defense
buildup and counterterrorism doublespeak. However, Parker
and Stone tend to be one-sided and histrionic with their mes
sage, not allowing you to agree with their ultra—libertarian po-
litical views. After eight seasons in television, Parker and Stone
seem better suited for a 22tminutc time limit, as parts of Tart/n
Arno [to drag.

Though I couldn't possibly explain Kim Jong 11's motivation
for evil in this him, except to get revenge for dropping his r‘s,
Team Almcrr'm has some funny moments. It’s a movie that will
make you believe a puppet can bleed, and perform the entire
Kama Sutra.

Shaun of the Dead (R)

Movies can be quite scholarly and tackle key legal and moral
issues. For instance, the key holding of the Supreme Court case
Dims/anal ‘l/r United Sam: is a person’s “right to be left alone."
The government doesn't have a right to control what you do
in your house, except for a few obvious restrictions. Perhaps
this right should be extended—shouldn't a guy, be be American
or otherwise, have the right to be left alone from anyone who
wants to force him to change his lifestyle, be it cop, mother,
girlfriend or zombie? That’s where sraaa 0/le Dead comes
in.

Slmlm of”): Dead is the story ofa guy (Simon Pegg), con»
venicntly named Shaun, who has made a nice British life for
himself, consisting largely of playing video games, working at
an electronics store and hanging out at a pub with his friends,
including his hot girlfriend. Not a cinematic life, but not a
shabby one, either, Things take a turn for the worse when his
girlfriend dumps him due to his monotonous schedule. Shaun's
routine is really rocked, though, when everyone in his town
turns into zombies and tries to eat him and his friends. Some
days, a guy can't get a break,

While the above is a formulaic zombie movie plot, S/mrm
aft/ac Dead, like 2003's 28 Dayr Lam, takes afresh approach
to the genre, laying a British comedy of manners on top of the
rotting walking corpsesr chg, the film’s co-writer, deftly intro-
duces thezombies into an ordinary day, showing busy urbanites
unaware of the monsters all around them. Slowly, the film {01*
lows convention, and as the hordes ofzornbies multiply, Shaun
gets his posse together in a facenff with the zombies for the
fate ofall mankind, or at least the fate ofthcir pub.

It all gets very violent, very chinlrous/patriarchal, yet also
rather farcical. Sir/um 0/212: Dead truly blends zombie and come

the scarlet and black

The Life Aquatic with Steve Zis-
sou (R)

Come and revel in the joys and tragedies of the making of
marine documentaries. Sound absurd? It kind ofis, but in the
most endearing way possible. The Lye/iguana with Sam Zir-
ran stars Bill Murray, Owen Wilson and, in one of his stranger
roles, Willem Dafoc,

Steve zrssou (Murray) is a wannabe Jacques Cousteau, a
leader of the Zissou society, captain of the Belafonte (an old

WWII boat), documentarian and owner of Zissou Island. He
is on a quest to find and destroy the mythical shark that killed
his beloved partner during part one of his newest documentary.
Murray turns in an excellent performance, taking his character’s
idiosyncratic absurdity very seriously.

Ned Plimpton (Wilson), a pilot from Kentucky, shows up,
claiming that he is Zissou's son and joins the team to help hunt
down the killer shark. Spoofing Cousteau, the cast even wears
red stocking caps throughout the film and follows some very
strange and hilariously fake sea creatures. The film is less about
storytelling and more about obscrl'ingid'lrcctor Wes Andep
son has assembled an amusing and touching bunch of charlie
ters for his latest off-beat ﬂick.

Only a director like Anderson, who also olchcstlarcd TIM
Raya/honorarium, could pull off this strange mit ofcampy, se-
rious, sad and happy that even feels like a budget documentary
throughout much ofthe film. And where else can you see Bill
Murray diving to techno music?
