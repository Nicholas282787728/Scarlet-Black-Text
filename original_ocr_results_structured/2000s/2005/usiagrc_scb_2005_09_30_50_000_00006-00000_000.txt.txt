As students prepare to scavenge
for dinner it (and, Marie Hasley wel-
comes them with a “hello" and swipcs
their indispensable Pic-lids granting
admittance to meals. When the trans-
actions at Cowlcs, Qiad 'and Gribrnr
G0 are added together, about 2,500 1),
card swipes are made each day.

With all this activity, Director of
Dining Services Dick Williams hired
Hasley and six other P-Card checkers
to “communicate policies in a friendly
and respectful way," he said. But as
some students have noticed, gone from
the checking roster is Darcy Noel.

The new PrCard checkers con—
stirutc the inaugiral group of Cheery
Checkers. Williams created the Cheery
Checking program to ensure that the
checking positions are filled by trained
employees.

According to Williams, “The
Checkers represent consistency and
stahiliry, so you see a familiar face each
day." But Williams may have neglected
that Darcy worked at the entrance to
Qiad for 23 years. She was told this
semester that she was needed behind
the scenes and would not be part of the
Cheery Checker program. According
to Bella Homing '07, “Darcy can seem
a bit prickly sometimes but she is actu—
ally pretty friendly"

Dining Services advertised the
Cheery Checker positions in rhe
Grimm/1 HeraldrRegilter and the Perle
nymwr.Williams conducted interviews
over the summer and said that the ape
plicants were interested in interacting
with studenrs, raking or. n few hours of

work and making some extra money

Kelli Bladshaw is a nurse at
Grinnell Regional Medical Center and
a mother of two, who works nights at
Grabrano. She said she enjoys meet
ing students. “I’m vely outgoing and I
like people."

All the while, she exhibits a nurse's
perspective on nutrition. “Sometimes
people come in and get all three meals
here," she said. "I would be concerned
ifI was their parent." After a student
stuffs a bagel, chips and a tiny carrot
package into the familiar white paper
bag, she chimes, “Have a good nighrl"

When Darcy checked PrCards, she
also interacted with students in the din-
ing hall. Gina Tumllo ’06 remembered
Darcy dressed up as a cowgirl during a
special dinner. Megan Niffencgget ’08
recalled sharing an experience with
Darcy regarding a funnyetasting apple.

Experiences over the years led Elia
aheth Lay '06, JJ Oliver ’05 and Meg
Ford ’06 to write a petition to get Darcy
back as a checker. They have collected
over 65 signatures so far and will com
tinue to pass around the petition. Darcy
said. “The petition is fmc with me.”

Some students have declined to sign
the petition. Allie Berger ’08 recalled
interacting with Darcy as a prospective
student. “I had unused lunch and dine
ner meal tickets, but no breakfast ticket.
Darcy wouldn’t let me eat breakfast.”
But others miss the familiar face out
front. Grant Custer ’08 agreed, “She is
a campus character. "

For Lay, the importance of Darcy's
presence goes beyond simple renown.
“Trying to explain why we want Darcy

back is like being demanded to defend
cir rationalize a longstanding friend-
ship,” she said. “I think that for most of
us, all we can say is that we miss her."

Assistant Director of Dining Ser-
vices Terry Waltersdorf wrote in a
recent email to Lay: “We have to use
people to the best benefit of the orga-
nization." Rita Vogel, the student em-
ployee supervisor of mud, said that
Darcy is doing a combination of things
in food production.

Oliver hopes to return Darcy to
her posr ar Qlad. “Ideally, I'd like to
see them give Darcy some shifts back
without dismissing the other Cheery
Checkers, ’he said
