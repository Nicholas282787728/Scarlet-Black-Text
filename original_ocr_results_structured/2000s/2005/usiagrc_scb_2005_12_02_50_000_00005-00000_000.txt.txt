Given your academic background, you've hccn cxposcd to a num-
brr orcriticrd thconts. Does this background affect how you ap-
proach art?

Well, I mcan.I do a lot ofrescarch before I watch a performance
or make a film. The difference between doing something prags
mstically in busmess or engaging in scholarly rrscarch and making
art is that art doesn’t always have a purpose — at least not a direct
purpose. You can opcn up a scrics ofqucstions and allow people to
explore the questions ifyou want or you can provide them with an
experience. I’m not so sure ifart always has a direct purpose. Do
painters have a purpose whcn thcy paint paintings? Probably not.
other than to make a paintingl don’t ask myselfwhar the purpose

Do you ever consciously
decide whether you want to
make your an more or less
controversial?

The topics that interest me
are topics that trouble the culs
ture in a more general sense, so
some ofthc work I’ve done is in-
tcrpreted as critical of or dealing

with difficult questions or things
like that. But those are just things [in which] I’m interested.
How do you formulatc a mcrhod to approach your an? Takc us
through that process. How do you move from an idea to an end
product?

Well, a lot of times the ideas that I want to deal with inform
the strategies that I’m going to use. In the case ofAKA Mrs. thrgt
Gilbtr:,I was interested in photography ofAngcla Davis from ’69 to
'72. She was one of the most photographed black women in Ameris
ca from that time. Her story becamc a national drama in which all of
America mntcd to participarc in some way, and all of America was
being culisrcd to participate by helping her be pur into prison and
ensuring she was executed or by defending her. So I was interested
in how the images functioned as part of that struggle.

But] thought about how] [could] reﬂect on that sum: 35 years
later. I had to have a filter through which to see these things I
needed to create a story in which viewers from the right and viewers
from the lcft would face off with on: anothcr, so my convcrsation
with the FBI agcnr is a way to bring to the foreground the fact
that it's not just the left that's interested in Angola Davis. It's rare
that a president. a governor and a head of thr FBI would be so
focuscd on making surc that a black profrssnr gets killed. And here.
was an instance in which Governor Reagan. President Nixon and
J. Edgar Hoover, who was head ofthc FBI. were working together
consciously to try to get her executed.

To what extent would you draw a parallel between the Vietnam
War era and today’s “War on Terror?"
I think thc difference is thc role of the media for me. I think

COURTESY KAMBUI OLUJIMI

thc media played a really critical role in the war in Vietnam in gal—
vanizing public opinion to be against the war. I think the media
has pretty much abdicatcd its role as a critical viewer of thc contllct
with the exception of a few independent sources. The American
networks are prctry pro whatever the U. 5. position is. In that scnsc
I see a big difference.

In Nixon's time the atmosphere of war allowed certain laws to he
passed that wouldn’t be permitted otherwise. just like today's Par
txiot Act. How do laws that arejusciﬁed by extreme circumstances
rather the work that you do?

The Patriot Act is extremely invasive, and it affects basically
any person in the United States because it jusriﬂes the unwarranted
search and seizure ofyour concspondcncc. Anybody's emails can in
read, anybody’s letters can be intercepted and you don’t have to be
under investigation for anything.

Also. thcrc have been attempts to criminalize things like rranslas
tion oftexts from sescalled enemy states.Well, that affects scholars
who are crying to get access to information about other societies and
othrr countrits [with which] wc may hr in conﬂict. What ifyour
specialty is Iranian cinema and you want to nanslare a text from
Persian script to English? Are you going to go to jail because you
translated an Iranian text?

There arc other problems that have to do with artists being ac-
cuscd. Several of my colleagues have been investigated; one guy ms
indicted. Several other artists have been arrested for performances
and artwork that at: critical of the government. Shows have been
shut down. It’s that climate of anything critical of the presidency or
of the war can come under scrutiny at any time, And that is some-
thing that is directly and indirectly a result of the Patriot Act.

There have been culture wars that led to a spread of cultural
values in organizations and universities for a while. I teach at Co-
lumbia. and there's bccn some controversy there in the last two or
three years involving professors who spoke out against the war and
involving professors who have been accused ofbcing pmsP'llestins
inn and anti-Semitic.That has led to the creation of tribunals where
professors can bc tried bccausc studcnts feel that they arc being prej»
udicial towards them in the classroom or intimidating or whatever.
So thcrc’s n climate of paranoia about expressing certain points of
view that sccms to be sprcading.

A lot ofnrtists involved in activist projects have come under scru-
riny or been harassed by authorities and so have professors who have
made statements against the warTherc’s the case of War Churchill
