At times, Grinnell's Residence Life
Coordinator apartments seem to have
revolving doors, The RLC's go in one
year and come right back out the next.

In the past two years, seven RLC's
have left: Don Weston, Mandy Fox.
Arny l<uipcr anti Trm Bosler in 2004,
and Jennifer Cobb, Tlavis Wilson and
Lucy l-lublrle rn 2005.

It might appear that Grinnell’s
Ofﬁce of Student Affalis is having a
problem letainlng its Re dcncc Life
Coordinators. Student Affairs staffand
current RLC’s insist that tllis is not the
case.

“RLC turnover is no diffclent than
it's ever been," says Tom Crady, vices
president of Student Affairs. “if any
thing, they have stayed On a bit longer,
on average, in recent years.”

Cobb and Hubble were the only

the scarlet and black

High RLC turnover actually a myth

RLC’s to stay for fewer than two ycars.

At the beginning ofthe 2004 school
year, when {our new RLC's wcrc hiied
to replace those who had left, Student
Affairs began to cmpllrlsi7 a new three
year rtilc. This came after two RLC’s,
Weston and Fox, left after a founyear
tenure, the limit is intended to Ensure
that RLC’s do not burn out.

The RLC position is an clitl'yslevel
job that usually leads to upper level
positions in Student Affairs or other
departments within three years, Genet-r
ally, RLC's will move on to be assistant
deans of student life, area coordinators
or other positions that do not involve
living with students.

Grinnell RLC's are salaried at
324,000 a year. According to Sheree
Andrews, they also receive free rooms,
14 meals a week free in the dining halls,
free laundry, professional experience

and academic advrsrng for those who
plan to return to 001.

“Overall [there is] generally a lac];
ornntlcr ding orwhatouriobs. e
like at other places and how staying for
one to two years is actually the norm,"
Stcplitnic Masta, RLC for Cowl cs,
Norris and Dibhlc said 'Staying {or
three years is really the erccptron ’

As for those who only stay on for a
year at Glinnell, Clark, Lnllgtlu, Gates
and Rawson RLC LcAnne loncs said,
"when pcoplc leave, it’s often Ithrr
Gi‘innell is] just not a good ﬁt."

While reasons {or early dcparnrrc
vary from person to person, Ci'ady
stresses that Grinncll RLC s are probal
bly sought out more frequentlv than on
other campuses citing self— governance
as a major tacror.

“Its a high stress job," Crady said.

Projectionists see films already' Improving

Films, Cant. from p. l

ForsterrSmith said that the current
training doesn't always help projection-
ists in avoiding mistakes, especially cars
ly in the year. "The big problem is, it's
an experiential learning curve," he said.
“You have to do it a bunch Oftimes.”

After initial training this year, pres
jectio’nists have had to learn as they go
and scramble to ﬁnd help when things
go wrong. “Many projectionists are
only showing movies once every couple
weeks Sims said Sometimes theyll
‘forget to do certain things even if the
directions are right in front of them,”

But depending on the problem, the
directions may not be there

“It’s not that they don’t want us
to know what we’re doing," said Isis-
Brown. “But we need to have a projecV
tiOnist checklist in the booth and we’ve
never had one." '

Sims said that he would Like to put
up more signage and that he is working
on a handbook for the projection booth.
“That would help with the some of the
delays, but not with problems like film
breaking, he said

Sims rs on call on weekends during
projections and said that he' is almost

always available. Projectionists can call
him for help, but sometimes don't.

“It’s sCriry to call me at home,”said
Sims, “but they can save the headache
by calling then instead of much later.
it’s part Ofmy job.”

Isis-Brown and Forster-Smith both
had positive outlooks for Films.

“It could be much worse, consider-
ing the number of new projectionists,"
said Forster-Smith. "At this point. I
only see it improving."

“I think this year will go mueh more
smoothly than usual,"Isis»Brown said.

g ASK THE PRE:

We see you running around the neighborhood

a lot. What' IS your weekly running volume? DO
you run in races? What other exercise do you do
regularly?

1 run and swim every day. 1 run early in the morning (at around
5 a.m,) and the distance varies between three and eight miles.I don’t
nln in races and rarely run with Someone else. I like being outdoors
and like the quiet orthe early morning. Occasionally 1 will run again
at around 5 p.m.1 started doing this when I was in college. I swim
about forty laps in our pool. usually at 11 a.m. or noon. I hope all or
you do something similar to Stan and stick with an exercise routine.
It has helped me a lot in remaining relatively trim and also staying
relaxed especially when there is stress,
