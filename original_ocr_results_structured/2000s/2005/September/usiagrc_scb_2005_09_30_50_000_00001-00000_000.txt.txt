Trustees arrive on campus for year ’5 fall meeting

Board to hear presentations of gender neutral housing, discuss budget issues, present endowment information to students

By BRIAN PERBIX

This morning marked the years
first meeting of the Board ofTriistees.
For students, it's something less than
pomp and more than circumstance as
the highest rung of the Grinnell Colt
lege hierarchy come together at th Old
Glove Gactoiy to discuss the future di-
rection of the institution.

Last night, trustee Clint Korver
’89 held an open disucssion in south
Lounge concerning the Board's en-
dowment philosophy. Over a dozen
tiustees attended and answered student
questions, The Board’s meetings will
last through noon on Saturday.

During theii stay on campus, the
trustees will meet with President Rus-
sell K. Osgood. Osgood said he will
make a presentation to “bring [the
board] up to date on where we aie re-
garding strategic planning."

The Strategic Plan is a document
that the board adopted in 2005 that
sets out the board's goals for the fur
cure of the college. The Plan contains
a controversial passage calling for tu—
ition increases. There are also passages
that form the basis of the Expanding

Financial Aid budget will also increase, but students question tying tuition to peer institutions

av REBECCA TAYLOR AND ARUNABH SINGH

The Strategic Plan approved in April 2005 by
the Board ofTrustecs outlines the future direction
of Grinnell very broadly. Among all the vows and
promises, one detail stands out especially to students.
"Implement a sustainable comprehensive pricing pol-
icy that reﬂects the quality and cost of our program.
Based on our current program, this Will require a
comprehensive fee increase that places our fee in line
with our Midwestern peers."

Last year, trustees proposed a 6.5 percent tuition
increase. Hundreds of students
protested in front of the Old Glove
Factory while the trustees met, but
the tuition increase was approved
anyway.This year, some SGA sena»
tors concerned about rising tuition
are trying to get their point ofview
heard earlier in the budget drafting
process.

The Budget Steering Committee meets monthly
to craft the budget. President Russell K. Osgood said
he would have an estimate for the 2007 Budget in late
October.

A senator for Loose, Read and Haines, Max Posts
man’08,said thatthe protest lastMarch came too late
in order to meaningfully express students’ concerns.
"We're not respected when we come late to the game
like that," he said. Postman hoped for increased stir
dent engagement on the tuition process this year.

“The administration is reasonable, but you have to
be able to speak their language," said Postman.“To do
so, you need to have certain facts."

Trustee Clint Korver '89, who gave an open prev
sentation on endowment spending Thursday night,
said that while Grinnell's endowment appears impress
sive, since 1998 there hasn’t been very much growth
adjusted for inﬂation in the educational sector. “Ifwe

get into a bad way, he said, we have to start cut-
ting programs or people."With the goal of reducing
potential risk to the endowment, the trustees are in
the process of reducing the amount the college spends
from the endowment annually from 4.25 percent to 4
percent. This has been coupled with tuition increases
to avoid cutting spending.

Financial aid will increase along with tuition.
Trustee Harold Fuson '67 said that one effect of rising
tuition will be to shift more of the total burden onto
those students whose family assets enable them to
afford an expensive higher educa-
tion. “It’s not inappropriate to ask
families to regard higher education
as a major family investment,” said
Fuson, who sent his two children
to Grinncil in the 1990s.

The tuition policy will also be
based on the comprehensive fees
that other com,
petitivc midwcstcrn liberal arts
colleges charge. Osgood says that
this is a good thing for students.
“Adopting that standard will hold
tuition from going above average.
He thinks that this standard will
keep Grinnell from charging the
amounts demanded by some small
liberal arts colleges on the East
Coast.

This does not alleviate concerns. “I think that
we’ll lose certain groups of students," said Senator
Davis Hart '06.

“One or the things that deters [prospective stu-
dents] from thinking about Grinncll, period, is thin
out niinun price is quite high,"said Fuson. “But I don't
think it matters iflt’s 535, or 540, or $30, All three of
those numbers are quite high ifyou don't have strong

merit.”

family resources.

Many students were critical of the plan to link
Grinnell’s tuition to midwestern peers. Postman said
that Grinnell's tuition increases need to be justiﬁed
in some other way. “We’re here because there is no
where like here."

Grinnell has been frequently listed as a Best Val-
ue College by the Princeton Review It is difﬁcult
to estimate how Grinncll’s position as a Best Value
College affects prospective students' choices to attend
the school. The most recent class went down in the
books as having the most applications ever, highest
yield ever and fewest transfers out.

Grinnell boasts an endowment that is among
the ten largest nationally in terms ofcndowment per
student. One idea with a strong hold on student
imaginations is that of a tuition-free Grinnell, which
was proposed several years ago. The Strategic Plan
does not mention the idea, and Hart, 3 member of an
SGA tuition committee, said that
the idea disappeared.

“The problem was not that the
idea was killed," Hart said. “It just
didn't gain momentum." Hart be
lieved that alumni would support a
tuitionsfree Grinnell.

In order to uplore tuitionsfree
nnell and endowment reliance,
Hart is planning to model nitrite

financial risk. “Trustees are always speaking of
risk," he said. “We want to look at how much ‘risk’ we
are willing to take." Grinncll relies on the endowment
for nearly 50 percent ofthe operating budget, and the
trustees are trying to decrease that reliance. Convorsv
ly, net tuition and alumni gifts supported more than
50 percent ofthe Opcrating budget in 1980 and nOw
