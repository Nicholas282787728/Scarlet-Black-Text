Last weekend, as alumni presented
the fniits of their posr~Grinnell fclr
lowships, as students crowded cential
campus to enjoy a riotous comedic
performance by their peers, as new a or
B reporter-s gathered to learn the tricks
of the rrade, something was missing.
Not a single minute on the college cal-
endar rvas set aside for remembering
the fourth anniversary ot‘arguably the
deadliest attack on the United States
in history.

The absence of shared renlcmbcr~

the scarlet and black

9/11 pasSes with little notice

ance can partially be explained by the
absence, for the first time, ofa student
body who was on campus when the lite
tacks occurred,

In most of our minds, Grinnell is
not strongly associated wtth September
11. We watched the news duinbfoundr
ed at home, not in a dorm lounge. We
learned details of the attacks gradually
in the hallways ofour high schools, not
in the loggias. Most importantly, we
shared our confusion and vulnerability
with friends to whom we may not have
spoken in months or ycats, not with
those we helped sober up last wcckend.

\thn federal ofﬁcials told Aincrir
cans to return to life as normal, it was
well undeistood that nobody actually
meant it: the everyday routine had her
come unthinkable in a nation where the

twin towers had been felled. Four years,
however, appears to have been enough
time for the Grinneu College comrnue
irity to heal.

Yet certainly anyone who made an
appointment on September 11, anyone
who saw that fateful date in an c—inail
header, anyone who
entered campus job
hours worked last
Sunday felt a twinge
of emotion. Emo-
tion dampened by
time and muddled by the political con—
notations that honoring the sactiﬁcc"
of the dead has acquired, perhaps, but
emotion no less,

It was, atter all, still September 11.

ultimately soothe our aching souls, but
we didnt sccm to need each other last
weekend.

Perhaps our ability to move on is
admirable. Perhaps we have finally re-
stored a sense of normality and have
nirned our eyes toward the present and
future

But even as we
look ahead, we must
not forget that we
live in precarious
times. We cannot
be oblivious to the destruction waged
on our earth, be it by war or storm.

Life is shalt. Don‘t be afraid to
show you care. Airer September ii, a
little more love in the world can do no
harm.

Taking on a congressman full of hate

For Iowa congressman Steve King, an ideal vision
ofAJnerica includes a razorwire rence spanning the
U. S. Mexico border, denial of citizenship to many hits
bies born in the U S. and
the annihilation of labor
unions,

I learned the details
of King's career last Frir
day at Central College in
Pella, where he spoke in
honor of “Constitution
Day." Central's coalition '
for a Multicultural Campus (CMCC) invited the
Grinnell Multicultural Alliance (GMA) to attend
this event in solidarity against King’s advocacy of laws
and constitutional amendments designed to further
marginalize oppressed social groups.

Kings belief in divine guidance is the cornersrone
of his belief that disenfranchised people should stop
demanding rights, He cited the Bible as a supreme
divine document and added: “I believe that the Dec»
laration of Independence is written with divme guide
ance—just a slighrly lower standard,"

After a vehement diatribe against what he viewed
as “activist courts" that “can make law from the bench,"
King outlined some of his own proposed Amends
merits to the U.S. Constitution.

He would amend the Constitution to deny US.
citizenship to babies of non—citizens born in the US,
outlaw tlag burning and define “natural" marriage
1 asked King how he reconciled his viewpoint that
the Constitution should be preserved with his own
propositions to amend it (an apparently hypocritical
stance). He replied that he represenrcd “the people."

Like King, Andrew Jackson promised to represent
the people. “The people,"in both cases, turned out to
be wealthy white men.

King used catch phrases like “we protected the
rights of the minority” to portray detractors as against
minority rights or in favor of “judicial activism,” In
fact, “judicial activism" is a term constructed by con-
servatives, with a political rather than historical

meaning. (I could cau King an “activist congressman"
because of his threat to try to abolish courts for failing
to rule in accordance with his interpretation of the
constitution.)

Liliana Renteria Y06
exposed King's lie about
“minority” rights. She
said, “Ustcd mcnciono
quc la Constitucion de
los Estados Unidos esta
disennda para protcgcr a
la minoria de las dccis r
nes quc potencialmenre puede romar la mayorl'a. gPo~
dria explicarme su definition de lo que es una minoria
o mayoria?"

Renteria torced Krrrg to acknowledge hrs Ignm
rancc of the languages and viewpoints he attempts to
erase with the “English only” initiative.

King advocated erasure of anything not part or
“the foundation that’s based on JudcorCliristian vale
ties." He framed his frightening desire to wipe out

as a patriotic expression of God’s
will

one of God’s children with an
equal opportunity?" he asked, and
added: “Assimilation is an Amerir
can value," In fact, the “American
value" of assimilation dates back to the lounding fa-
thers King invoked in his speech. King failed ro rrrcne
tion, however, that America's history of assimilation is
a history ofracism.

After slavery was established, “Civilization" and
‘Assimilation” to an Anglo standard became the terms
to define rhe racial hierarchy and justify the economic
interests ofthe ruling class. A policy of“civilizing" lns
dians allowed Thomas Jetrerson to begin expanding
into their land. This “assimilation” initially took the
form of cultural destruction, as the US. government
torccd Indians ro speak English and change their
daily lives. Under Andrew Iaekson in 1830, Congress

passed the Indian Removal Act. The United States
Army invaded sovereign Indian nations and commit—
ted genocide in the name of “Manifest Destiny," the
idea of white responsi i].ity to civilize inferior people,
After the Mexican American War ended in 1848, the
[1.3 annexed one third of Mexican land and used
the same rationale to justify stealing the land of the
people living there.

And King wonders why anyone would resist “ass
similntion."

King asserted that he was color-blind. King’s
statement is not only dishonest, it ignores centuries
of legauy sanctioned discrimination and torture of
people ofcnlor in the United States.

Blaming historICiIlly and currenrly marginalized
groups for their own oppression, King said, "[Multi-
culturalism] means to tear down the United States of
America," He explained, “I've seen it cause people to
line up in groups and demand rights based on their
membership in groups."

The way the Cherokee people demanded the right

to maintain their sovereign nation.>
The way blacks protested for equal
rights under the law?

Countless historical docu-
ments rind current news Sources
prove rhir iden tysbased discrimr
ination exists. S lies of black peo-
ple and poor people left behind in
New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina demonstrates
we are a long way from achieving social equality in
America.

To deny this tact and shape policy or choose Su-
preme Court Justices based on this denial is not only
dishonest but also dangerous

Any American who claims that identityrbasecl
ﬁghts for survival by marginalized groups are the
roots of, rather than reactions to, social divisions needs
to be locked in a room with a good history text. Any
elected ofﬁcial who denies people’s right to demand
justice from their government should be immediately
impeached.
