Tupac Resurrection (R)

The afterlife hiis been good to rapper Tupac Shakur. since his
death in 19% his record sales and status as a hip-hop legend have
soared Trip/rs. RtrI/Vrt'f/imi is the latest contribution to the Tupac
legacy, a documcntary with an autobiographical twist.

Using archival interviews and family footage accumulated over
Tupac's brief but meteoric life and career, director and producer
Lauren Lazin (an MTV executive) has enough material to allow
Tupac to narrate his own story. Using ruminations on his first brush
with death (Tupac was shot once before the drivcrby shooting that
took his life), Lazin constructs the illusion that the rapper is narrat-
ing and reﬂecting on his own death, as well as life-Tho result is eerie,
and packs a strong emotional punch,

The bulk of the documentary is a rcilection on Tupac's path
from a troubled childhood to an elite performing arts high school
and eventually to the challenges and turmoil of the Los Angles
hipshop world. In his patchwork reflectionsTupac comes across as
thoughtful and sincere, a consistent and meaningful narrative voice
emerges as he tells his story. His mother Afeni Shakur (who is also
the films executive producer) provides a wealrh of material from
Top acs childhood and teen years, adding a heartfelt dimension to
theP film as well as a unique level ofinsight to what could have easily
could have been merely another film idolizing the “thug life".

The one shortcoming of Tuprit: chlli‘i‘lc‘hml is that it is too quick
to minimize the contradictions inherent in the title chatactcrfupac
speaks passionately about crime and the socioeconomic problems
facing the black community, and he comes across as earnest and
heartfelt. YCI the film glosses over his own arrests for violent crime
and the often misogynisric and violent messages of his music.This is
fitting for a homage, which the film clearly is, but does little to fully
explain him. However, regardless of its slant, Wilma-Rcirrriwrzimi is a
wcllrctaficd and strikingly fitting homage to one ofhipshop's most
talented and enigmatic performers,

Batman Begins (PG 13)

After the apparent demise ofthc Batman series with the income
parably awful (critically and financially) Batman a Room, Warner

Brothers must have noticed the piles of money that Fox and Sony ‘

were bringing in with the X-Men and Spider-Man movie adapta-
tions, and decided to give the ol' Capcd Crusader another go. Rising
like a phoenix from the ashcs of previous cinematic adaptations of
the classic comic book hero, Enrrlmii Brgiiri represents a rebirth of
the series. This is not a sequel/prequel: this represents a complete
retelling ofthc lcgcnd ofthc Bat.

Whilc Tim Burton’s Barman films are told like a nightmarish
fairytale and Joel Scltumacher’s are all explosions, glitterati and
glamorama, director Christopher Nolan, best known for directing
Memo/o, brings Batman back to his psychological archetype, and
brings realism to the forefront of his ﬁlm.

Nolan tells the story of Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale), the bilr
lionaiie playboy whose parents were murdeied before his cyes as
a child. Bruce inherits his father’s fortune, but can never find true
happiness while he hung - justice. 50 at night Bruce dons the
persona ofBatman and admi crs his own brand ofvigilame his
ticc to the streets of Gotham City.

Christian Bale was a fan-favorite for the role of Btucc Wirync/
Batman, and delivers with a performance that is an interesting
plunge into the depths ofthe psyche ofrhc tormented Bruce Wayne.
Cillian Murphy, Morgan Freeman, Michael Cain and Liam Neeson
all give memorable performances in supporting roles. Katie (“Runl
Now’s your only chance!") Holmcs' acting is not quite up to par with
the rest ofthe cast, and honestly, her role only exists because orthc
demand for a romantic interest. The romantic subplotjust seems to
distract from the real story.

The story, written by David s. Goyer (Dar/t City), tells the ori-
gins ofthe Batman mythos: Batman's crimc fighting carccr is youn
he’ is inexperienced and hasn’t quite perfected his techniques yet,
The plot is swccpingly epic; with young Bruce Wayne first trained
by, and later brought into conﬂict with, the mysterious League of
Shadows The film's action sequences havc all the style and ﬂair of
a good kung fu flick. Unlike most recent comic book film adaptar
tions, computcr generatcd imagery is sparse, and with the exception
ofthc Batmobilc sequence, human action and solid cinematography
create the thrills in this movie. Although the ending is a bit cliche,
Nolan’s direction of the first two thirds of the film solidify it as the
best Batman film to date.

overall, Brit/unit Regina presents Batman as moic realistic and
gritty than any other Batman lilm to date For rhosc who know your
comics, this is more S/mri'a'w Aft/lt- Brit than DUN/”Jr Cumin. For

ood Bye Leni l (

1 like German people a lot. Maybe it's because my last name is
the German word for plum or perhaps it is because Germans pros
ducc wonderﬁll and innovative ﬁlms,such as the 2003 ﬁlm GardBye
me’, a witty film portraying life in Germany during and after the
fall ofrhe German Democratic Republic, Rather than being a social
commentary, the film focuses on the relationship between an activist
son and his orthodox Communist mother.

The film begins with student and activist protests against the
regime and particularly a student named Alex (Daniel Briihl). Dur-
ing a chaotic protest, Alex and some of his comrades are arrested.
The scene is profusely violent and disheartening for Alcxs mothcr,
Kathrin (Katrin Sab), and the shock ofwitncssing her sons disloyal
activities and his incarceration induce her falling into a coma.

Kathrin iiwakcs to a new, united Germany. Together with his
sister Lara (Chulpan Khamatova) and their companions, Alex tries
to prevent his mother, a faithful East German, from discovering the
unification As she moves (mm the hospital bed to her apartment,
Alex struggles to recreate the old country.

He devotes all his time (when he s not courting a bcautiful nurse
it the hospittl) toward creating the illusion Assisted by friends
who help him create specious news reports, convince young chilr
drcn to lcarn old Communist anthems and even locate the cherished
East German stylc food, Alex is fairly successful in masking the
changes Germany had cnr
durcd during her time spent
in o comar

While the film might
have been tedious if (hi: ens
rireryhad focused on creating
these illusions, there are ad-
ditional cvcms such as Alex
courting the nurse, changes
happening in Germany and
reflections upon former life in East Germany that prevent the film
from becoming paliid and repetirive.

The film is touching, but not profusely emotional. While Alex
could be out enjoying his new country, he instead dedicates his time
to his delicate mother‘s happiness and health, despite their conﬂict
ing political proclivirics.

Although the film contains dialogue criticizing both East and
West Germ-any, l was relieved that the film remained fairly objec-
tivc. Wolfgang Becker, the director, adroitly avoided creating an
overly rcpctirivc film through convincing character development,
intriguing characters and clever scenes,

Rather than focusing on the bleak political milieu, Wolfgang
Bcclccr demonstmms that there is still altruism during the worst
of (iihL‘Sc Most of the differences illustrated in the film between
the communist cast and capitalist west are humorous and faccrious,
rather than hostile.
