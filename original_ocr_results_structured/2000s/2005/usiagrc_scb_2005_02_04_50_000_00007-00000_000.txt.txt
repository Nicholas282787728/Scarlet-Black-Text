Charles, Ron
Ray (PGv13)

There has been a lot of Oscar buzz about Jamie
Foxx’s performance in Ray. The truth is, he deserves
that Oscar, Ray is a biography of jazz great Ray
Charles (Foxx), and Porn is stunning in his portrayal,
mastering Charles’c tracteristrc head tilt and chlitmr
rng open-mouthed smile.

At the beginning, the movie seems to set up a Cin—
derella story, as Charles goes from growing up poor
in the Deep South, watching his younger brother’s
drowning, and going blind at age seven to becoming
one of America’s greatest musical icons.

However, the film doesn’t hesitate to be frank
about Charles’ struggles~his battle with drugs, ins
eluding his rehabilitation, his multiple affairs and
even rougher battle with segregation—and it is this
honesty that gives the movie its depth. But while the
film does give us biographical information about the
artist, the movie is largely about the art itself and fo—
cuscs more on his transformation as an artist than
biographical details.

While the movie is excellent overall, the second
half drags, mostly due to the fact that we already know
the ending, and director Taylor Hackfotd doesn't do
a good enoughjob of spreading out the material over
the two-and-a—haLf hour movie. At these dragging
moments, the music makes the movie worth watche
iug, as each scene pulsatcs \vith Charlcs' music The
movie undeniably fosters a greater appreciation for
Charles musical genius and the way in which he lash»
iontd his own brand 01 music from Jazz, gosp,cl and
orchestral background.

In the end, the movie degenerates into bickering
between Chailes'managers before tying the movie up
neatly with Charles remaining faithful, drug free, and
a must i icon. Obviously, the real story is a little more
complicated, but Hackford, unfortunately, doesn't give
us the full story.

Nevertheless, the movie does what few biographi»
cal movies achievciit presents a vivid, riveting poi-e
trait of a musical and cultural icon and is a worthy
tribute to the late Charles.

The stuff of legends: Ray

Burgundy

ism. In this film about friendship, love, and death,
Remy (Remy Girard), a Montreal history professor,
is diagnosed with a terminal illness and hospitalized
indefinitely.

Remy, a self-defined “sensual socisilist" has est
rranged his evavifo Lousie (Dorothee Berrymin) and
son Sebastien (Stephane Rousseau) through a life—
time of enjoying too many women and too much fine
wine. However, in these last days, Remy’s cx-wtlc asks
Sebastien, a conservative London l-Bauls ', to return
to his father's bedside for what is expected to be the
last time. The two butt heads when Remy accuses
Sebastien, and by extension, his generation, oi’being
seduced by capitalism and wealth and bringing about
the end ofintellectualism, academia, and literature. It
is clear. however, that this issue, like life, is murky and
nuanced and blame lies with both generations.

Eventually, Sebastien realizes that he is one of the
only people who can provide comfort for Remy in his
final days, and succeeds in reuniting his father with
old friends, lovers, and acquaintances who arrive to
discuss subjects ranging from sex to politics to rciie
gion,

While the reunion of former and current lov-
ers and friends is inevitably awkward at first, it is a
touching and poignant wav for the seven characters
to relive their younger days and reconnect as they say
goodbye to one oftheir own. Arcand skillfully directs
a movie tltat cornmentatcs on the Canadian universal
health care plan, the generation gap, and euthanasia.
He deals with the gravity of life and death without
resorting to rirerl cliches.

Anchorman: The Legend of
Ron Burgundy (PG-13)

Any man can tell ajoke. Maybe it’s because worn-
cn have convinced us that a sense ofhutnor is a man's
most attractive trailiso Jude Law must be hilarious.
Above the level of the evervrnan, though, stands he
who can make ajoke out of'something mundane, like

carton of milk. a pct dog, or out societys rampant
sexismVVill Ferrell is one of these men.

Heteronormativity aside, Will Ferrell was our
generations best Saturday Night Live performer
The big hairy awkward bundle of energy was great
at portraying President Bush, but was even better
at sketches wrth nameless characters, like the naked
dirty homeless guy or the beiligerenrly drunk father.
Thus far in his film career, he has stuck with the same
twwcl'tmens‘ionol characters, be it old frat boy, El or
Atribarman.

Ferrell’s Ant/20mm: is Ron Burgundy, the witless
yet popular newscaster who dominates 1970s San
Diego TV screens. In an era without cable news net-
works and the Equal Rights Amendment—too bad

Tbt/r/rn ‘Rny" ir a biograpbim/pbi-

we only got one of those—Burgundy rules the roost
with his three on-air sidckicks, the most mcmotable
being Brick Tambland (Steve Carell), a weathermatr
cumrmoton. However, the TV sausage party is broken
up by the arrival of veronica corningstone (Chris-
tina Applegatc) a hot-yet»ttrifuiiiiy ambitious reporter
with eyes on the anchor chair.

Little of Ant/wurmu'r humor stems from its
mundane plot or Ms. Corningsrone. Instead all the
laughs—arid there are many—come from the news»
men, Vi’hile it's distressing that they couldn't find a
capable comedienne, Ferrell, Carell and the multitude
ofcameos pick up the slack. Ferrell’s doltish yet dev-
ilish delivery saves Arrrbbnnmr from being a soulless
comedy like Dar/gem]! or Shorty andHritrb.

Ferrell is the best pure comedian working today,
and it would be nice if he went after material that
matched his talent. But I’ll still watch him call Chrisa
tina Appiegare a whore any day.

BY ERIC Ronu

Even after seeing countless brief video clips and
reading newspaper descriptions, Taniango’s Urban
Tap still manages to defy an easy description, This
unconventional group combines dance, music, and
video in a mesmerizing performance Not limited to
any one style or set for their shows, the skilled group
of artists improviscs much of their performance each
night, giving the show a raw and organic feel.

The group's founder, Tnmango, a multi-talented
tap dancer, musician and artist, founded Urban Tap
in 1993, and soon the group gained a great deal of
recognition after many club performances in New
York City.

The group performed at the Bilckshtiilm Center
for the Arts Feb. 2 and 3 in Roberts Theatre. The
music for Urban Tap is performed by a ltvt: ensemble
of musicians from around the globe that play, among
other things, Haitian drums, cello, didjcridoo and
trumpet.

The music mix the styles of the group's highly
talented and largely inter onal rnusicrans and pm,
vides the base for the dance element of the showThe

groups dance element, though, is the real highlight of
the performance. The Urban Tap dancers make dif-
ficult dance moves look effortless, and lend ﬂuidity to
tho pcrfonnancefthe dancers take the foreground in
the show, giving a focus between the rhythmic music
and mesmerizing video that serves as a backdrop to
the performance.

Urban Taps unique melding of styles can likely
be attributed to Tarnango's global upbringing. Born in
French Guinea,Tamango later moved to Paris where
he learned tap until moving to New York City, where
the Urban Tap group began. covering a wide variety
ofsrylcs, the dancing in the Urban Tap shows incote
porates elements oftap, hipehop and African dance in
a unique blend of its own.

Uibin rap’s unique blend is what makes it such
an enthralling piece Drawing the audience in initial
ly with its traneclikc, almost tribal sounding musrc,
Urban Tip ieally shincs when the dancers perform
The entire pcit'oimance cxpciicncc blends modern
elements such as video and electronic effects on his
strtinicnts with thc organic and riveting nature of its
dance and rhythms.
