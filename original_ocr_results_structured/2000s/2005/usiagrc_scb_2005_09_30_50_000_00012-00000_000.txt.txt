The Pioneers had a sluggish start
against the visiting Blue Boys fiom Illi-
nois College last Saturday The football
team had difﬁculties on both sides of
the ball that started early in the game.
The offense struggled with moving the
football and the defense had problems
with stopping the run.

Illinois College used these setbacks
to pull ahead to a 27-0 lead by the end
ofthe first half

Despite a solid push by the Pioneers
in the second half, Grinnell lost the
contest 47r21, dropping their record to
173 (073 MW C).

“The first half was no fun at all,”
said Head Coach Greg Wallace as
Grinnell headed into the locker room
with a large deficit after two quarters.

The Pioneers took control dur-
ing the second half, thanks to the arm
of quarterback Sean Pfalzer ’07 and
the legs of fust—yeal running back C}
Moore.

Grinnell outscored Illinois concge
21,20 during the last two quarters of
the game.

Pfalzct connected with Ben Remt
ington '08 on the opening drive of the
third quarter for a touchdown and later
hit I<yle Perry '08 for another score.
Moore ran for 69 yards in the second
halfand 87 total yards in the game.

said Moore “We went in at halftime
and just told ourselves that we are here
ter than what we showed in the fiist
half."

The Pioneers' second wind was
more than a change of hear.

“The coaches prepared us very well
for that game and it was up to us to
do what we knew we could do," said
Moore. “Just too bad we couldn't pull
off a win."

“1C basically dominated the Line
of scrimmage the whole first half and
took advantage of our lackluster perfor—
mance," said Leo Martin '06, who led
the defense with 19 tackles.

Brett Maloney ’09 also contribe
uted with 15 tackles and Pat Fauter
’09 rounded out the top three defent
sive performances of the game with 13
stops and one sack.

Both the offense and the defense
will have a week off as Grinnell enters
their bye week.

as well as for their performance.

“We have 6 games remaining and it
is imperative for us to get healthy," said
Conch Wallace. “We need every player
ready to play. We had several players on
the sideline in street clothes that we
need in uniform when we play in two
weeks. our players are working hard
in practicc and we will focus on fundae
mcntals and execution this week.”

Coach Tom Sonnichsen sen. “That not only affects contests,

but ‘it also affects practices."

The Pioneers are still struggling to settle into a
comfortable rhythm,which is difficult due to the fre
quently changing setup for the team.

“Volleyball is a game inﬂuenced strongly by mo—
mentum," said Sonnichsen. “You need to be strong
mentally to maintain focus through the shifts in mo,

The Pioneers put up a good fight in theii first
match of the tournament against Beloit, which is
ranked second in the North Division.

Grinnell pulled Within five points of Victotv in two
of the three games against Beloit, but failed to come
away with a win

“We probably played our best this season [in that

having a more consistent starting l1neup which always
helps get some stability in the team. Before we didn't
know who was going to play where and how things
were going to go in the game."

Coach Tom Sonnichsen was also encouraged by
the team’s performance against Beloit last weekend,
“It was an indication of what we are capable of if we
execute consistently,"said sonnichsen.

The Grinnell mens soccer team suffered two
tough losses last week. The Pioneers lost 2,0 to Beloit
on sept. 24 and then fell to Monmouth last sunday
in a difﬁcult 3‘2 loss at home.

Goalkeeper Sam Lancaster '08 was disappointed
by the team’s performance against Beloit. “We didn’t
come out hard against Beloit at all,” Lancaster said.
“We can't seem to put together a game whcrc our der
fense does well and our offense does well."

Sunday’s game against Monmouth started out
well. Ben schrager'oz scored both ofGrinnell‘s goals
during the first half of the game, putting Grinnell
ahead with a comfortable 270 lead at halftime.

Monmouth regrouped during halftime and quick-
ly changed thc tide of the match. The ﬁrst Mone
mouth goal was scored during the beginning of the
second half and it was followed up by another goal
three minlltcs afterward. The final Monmouth goal
was scored off a free kick during the last minutes of
the game, clinching the victory for the v ting team.

The Pioneers were surprised by th performance
during their game against Monmouth. “This team’s
really been about hard work and playing for each

 

other, said forward Andrew Walsh '09. But then [in
the Monmouth game] we just fell apart, which isn't
something we’d usually do.”

The team needs to focus on “playing all 90 min-
utes,"said Lancaster. “We get scored on in the last ten
minutes ofgames all too often."

overall, this has been a disappointing season for
the Grinnell mcn, bllt they still have faith In the team
as a whole

“We to deﬁnitely upset that we ’re not playing well,
but were absolutely going to continue to play hard,
theres no doubt about that,” said Lancaster. I feel like
we’re a better team than our record would suggest."

The team has a pair ofdit'ficult matches coming 11p
this weekend against Lawrcnce and St. Norbert, two
of the best teams in the Midwest Conference.

The games will determine the fate of the soccet
team's season. The Pioneers need to win the remains
tier oftheir conference matches to make it to the Mid-
west conference Playoffs.

“ 1 think ifwe put in a good week ofttaiuing we
may even do better agaii , he tougher teams than the
easy teams," said Walsh. lhat's kind of what we do,
We're the underdog."
