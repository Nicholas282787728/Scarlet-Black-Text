l have a headache and a Iran I have a
headache because I’ve been sitting here for
two hours eariug Nutella out of the jar with
a baby spoon while working on a presentation
on three Picasso paintings. I have a hat that's
black and a little poofy with a small bill so that
I match the artists in the paintings. It’s offi—
cially become my Picasso hat: my artist hat: my
crazy fashion hat: my Spain hat.

It'll be my reminder of my crazy time in
Spain,rhe Spain ofPicasso's painting: rcd Spain,
8 Spain of blood, passion and love and black
Spain, a Spain of intolerance and death: two
traditions that have run parallel throughout
Spain's history. But back to the her.

It’s not just me in the strange hat.

They wear some crazy hats in Spain,

but there aren’t enorrgh of them to

cover up all the horrible haircuts,

The fru- coat choice is logical for

the Furs for Franco crowd and the

way European kitls tiress is adoir
able, brrt one particular fashion 1
will not miss is the Euro-milk
let not to be confused with the
Euro rattai1,\vliicli I think is a
runner up for worst fashion
faux pas, followed closely by
the pointystocd shoes

Getting orl the riietro
today I got funny looks for
wearing my slippers (flip
flops) before lune lwiiitcd . .
to grab them all by their
mullets and rattarls and drag
them ovei to a minor and
ask them if rm really the
one with the problem; at least I don’t look like
a hockey player from the 80s with the feet of
the Wicked Witch of the West.

Once I had them captive and on the topic
of current culture, I would also like to talk to
them about the paradox of Spain's passionate
nightlife. I’m perfectly fine with waiting urn
til 1 arm. to go out and staying out all night
to have chocolate and churros in the morning,
sincc really, life during the day is not all that
taxing here, but what I want to know is why
todo el mundo chooses to stay at the clubs until
6 am. every weekend dancing to techno.

They got it so right with tapas, well, besides
bartenders conveniently forgetting to upgrade
foreigners from chips to cheese, but sometimes
1 just want to shake the DJ for playing so much
damn techno.

The good, the bad, the ugly of Spain

If it does get to that point, I dont know
if Spaniards, at least the younger generation,
would take offense with being pushed around-
it's generally a pretty physically demonstrative
culture that reﬂects its “red side." Ifthe leaders
or kids at the youth center where I volunteer
want someone to move, they yell move, often
addressing each other as “chino,”“negro,"“gorc
do," as the case may be.

When you greet and say goodbye Spaniards
kiss and in between they do what it takes. I
ﬁnally ﬁgured out the most effective way to get
Oliver back on his side ofthe field at the center
is just to up and grab him by the arm or back of

the shirt and shove him over, yell move, and
no one thinks anything ofit.

Granted, when it comes time to play

with water balloons at the end ofrlic day,

having 8 13-year old boys turn on me

is kind ofinconvcnrent and unpl eaSr

antly squishy afleiwaids, but there

is no place for tirnidity iir Spain.

interfering wrth anybody, they're allowed to
be who they are and ifyou want to give them
a bug or a shove or, you're free to do so, but
nobody has to pretend to be removed or coolly
distant and they have every right to douse us
with freezing water if they want to. They all
treat each other straightforwardly in a way
thatjust wouldn't be cool or P.C. in the States.

That’s not to say that they don't have stan—
dards for courtesy, too. The younger generar
tions can yidl and push and shove, but it’s a
high crime in the eyes of old people to sit on
the ground, stretch or yawn in public, and vmlk
around the house without slippers (bedroom).
My senora was certainly not pleased when
I sloshcd in after the water balloon fight, in-
sisring I walk back to my room sliding towels

,along under my feet.

Adapting to these rules is important,
though, because family rules and blood ties
rule supreme in Spain and it's just not smart
to go around pissing off tr family member. It's
simplcr just to slide along on towels, car wlrao

The vibrant, passionate people or Spain
seem completely indifferent to the plight orthc
gypsres, choosing to treat them like lepcrs and
accusing them of every problem imaginable
that they aren't already blaming on the lVloioc—
cans, from violent crime to a bad crop year.

While hladrilcnos snub these groups, the
leaders at the youth center analyze and treat
them, helping each child find his or her way
in a country still divisible into red and black. I
now know that on psychoanalytical rests Mos
roccan kids still draw their houses with flat
roofs and lots of immigrants draw trees with
deep, complicated roots for stability. A lot of
South American kids at the center have sib-

xenophobia is an embarrassment for Spain and
a hindrance to needed immigrants,

Some Madrilefios commit acts ofviolence
to keep others out while Basque terrorists
(ETA) attack journalists to get out of Spain
themselves. 1 tagged along on a tour of El

Investigating the legends ofthc two Spains
takes a whole lot of field work. Most practis
cally, I’ve learned that Spaniards don't like it
when l speak English loudly and no one can
hear me ifI speak Spanish softly. I still don't
know why techno is so essential to nightlife or
why gypsics are treated like lepers, but I know
how to go about finding out.

Generally, Spaniards want to communicate
just as badly as 1 do, so 1 might as well give it

Sakartvelos gaumarjos: democracy the right way

Okay, “Ich bin ein Berliner" it's not. But when President
Bush declared “Glory to Georgia“ in the Georgian tongrc before
150,000 people in Tbilisi, it vars probably received just as pointr
edly in Russia as John F. Kennedy's German utterance. As for-
merly soviet states slip one by one our of the backwards-looking
Russian orbit, Vladimir Putin is worried.

At no time was that more pointedly obvious than durs
ing President Bush's recent trip to Russia, the Ealtics
and Georgia. His Texas two-step between condemning
Russia‘s slide into tyranny and praising the soviet Union's
sacriﬁces against the Nazis in World War II made for his
teresting viewing for those of us who get our kicks from
CsSPAN, at least. ,,

Agree or disagree with Bush’s democratizing
goals in the Middle East (or, more to the point, his
militaristic methods), it’s hard to find fault with
America's steadfast support for budding denim
crats in formerly communist states. The preva
lence of semi-authoritarian states around Russia
has long cast a blemish on the aftermath of the
soviet Union's collapse, and finally this seems to be changing.

The president could leam a few things from how Georgia
overthrew their autocratic leader. President Shevardnadze was
ridden out of town on a rail despite licary Russian support bcr
catrsc his own people decided he had to go. While the Geor-
gian opposition parties got western support, including from the
National Democratic Institute and the International Republican
Institute, it was a homegrown revolution.

In fact, the New York Time: on April 26 described support
for the man who led the "Rose Revolution" against Schevard-
nadze, Mikhail Siiakashvili, as so strong that Americans had to

give some support to a smaller political party to avoid a total rout.
Contrast that with the mixed reception that the new government
in Iraq has gotten.

During this fall's Rosctrficld symposium on worldwide des
inocracy, Cornell University Professor Valerie Birnce gave a con-

vocation speech entitled “Demociatic and Other Transitions:

Posteommunist Eurasia.”One of the most interesting things

she said was that the string of democratic revolutions in

formerly communist countries is ccrr
rainly not a coincidence.

The process began in Yugoslavia,

following the NATO bombing cams

leaders from Geor-

gia were on planes to

Belgrade as soon as

they could arrange it. As democracy has

spread from Yugoslavia to Georgia to the Ukraine to Kyrgyzstan,

it’s been because people in those countrieswantcd robe frec,aird

got help.

This demonstrates that complexity of dcniocratization On
the one hand, by far [liC most efficient (and preferable) way to
topple a dictator is from the inside. on the other hand, l'ocal
opposition leaders usually need help, even military assistance. Af-
ter all, even America's own revolution was dependent on French
troops.

The way things are going in the world right now, it's especialr
ly important that we get this right, Prcsidcnt Bush has admirably

were also doing it against considerable opposition.

Authoritarians the world over have learned a very different
and much less inspiring lesson from Yugoslavia, Georgia, the
Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan: none of the ousted leaders in those
countries used violence to subjugaie protest-
ers. All otrhcm are out orwork today.

Most significandy, Russia itself this year was

Vladimii Putin’s campaign against the in-
dependent media, his use of the judicial system to jail political
opponents and his constitutional reforms designed to cripple any
possible opposition make the most ardent Democrat feel posir
tively cinpowcrcd.

President Bush's sclfrproclaimed dedication to democracy
promotion abroad will be judged primarily in two arci , the
Middle East arid the former Soviet Union. The former is likely
to be viewed in a partisan manner for years to come at the least,
but everyone can be inspired by the Rose RevolutionThe ques-
tion is wlicther the president will be willing to lay as much on rhc
line elsewhere after his Mesopotamian misadventure. Let’s hope
he learns the right lesson,
