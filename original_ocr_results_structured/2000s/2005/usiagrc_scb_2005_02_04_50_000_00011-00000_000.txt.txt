The Monmouth victory, the nation-
al attention from ESPN, and a lengthy
stay at home in Darby should help rho
Pioneers sustain a srrong push rhrough
the rest ofthe season.

The women's team also beat Mon-
mouth substantially, to the tune of an
86-71 ﬁnal score. Hannah Wolf‘08 led
the way, dropping 25 points, including
seven threespoints
ers, and picking up
seven steals. Katy
Bowen ‘06 also had
a big game, scoring
16 points and tally-
ing eight steals

“It was nice

to get home and play,“ said Bowen. “I ,

think the win has given us a lirtle more
conﬁdence in our abilities, I think we
have a very ralenred team, but being
young and roadsweary we haven’t al-
ways played to the best of our abilities.
The win was huge in boosting our cons
ridenee and letting ourselves know that
we can do this."

The women’s win also calne after
a long string ortough losses, six on the
road and two at home. Grinnell bear

and St. Norbert at home, and Carroll
and Lawrence on the road again.

The Monmouth victory pulled
their record to 443 overall and 2,9 in
ch play.

The women’s team was also excited
about the prospects of playing More a
large crowd on Thursday night against
Beloit,

“We went to the wire when we
played Beloit ar
rheh- place and lost
because of some
mental errors at the
end or the game,"
said Bowcnt “We
need to have men,
tal toughness down
the stretch against
them. They’re going to make runs, it
basically comes down ro our ability to
respond. They are also big in the post,
so it's going to take a big game from
our post players defending tllcm and
our guards keeping up the pressure on
their guards. Our key is ro keep pres
sure on the ball and force them to make
mistakes." .

Borh tennis play today as well

gmme begins at 5 p.m., the men’s game
at 7. Both teams will also host Illinois
