It’s game time

After winning the Student Showcase contest for his sheep-
herding video game "Mutton Mayhem," John Edwards '06 will
travel to San Francisco for the Game Developers Conference

av MAC POHANKA

Next weekend, john Edwards ‘06 will travel to
San Francisco for the Game Developers Conference,
not only as an observer, but also as a presenter. Ede
wards, in physics major, will showcase and demon-
strate his computer game, “Mutton Mayhem," which
won the Student Showcase contest for the Indeperr
de‘nt Game Festival (IGF), Part of the overall cone
ference.

The contest was for strident game developers.
The only major requirement was that games be dce
signed and created solely by students. As the ﬁrst
place winner, Edwards won a free trip to the Game
Developers Conference, which lasts from March 7
to 11, He also gets to have his game on display at
the IGF.

The Games Developer Conference is one of the
largest game conferences in the countryThrouglrout
the weekend, there will be lectures, panel discussions,
tutorials, a game expo and many other activities re—
lated to game development.

Although three of Edwards' friends from his
hometown otShoreline, Washington. were involved
the creation of“Mutton Mayhem," Edwards coded
the majority of the game and did about half the art.

“Mutton Mayhem" is a multi-player game for
Windows computers. Edwards described it as and
“action strategy game" that was "designeled" rather
than concepteled. Instead ofstarting with an idea of
what they wanted the game to be about, Edwards and
his friends started out with an idea ofwhat functions
and features they wanted their game to have.

Edwards and his friends decided to build their
game around character types with checks and bal-
ances to create a “self-balancing game."“we came up
with a basic rock- aper-scissors economics model"
where “the game would] revolve around some re
source that was in short supply,“ Edwards said.

“Once we had our model, we looked for a re-
source and scenario that would ﬁt it,” Edwards said,
The group decided on sheep as the resource because
they at the design and sheep itre “kind ofﬁmny in
general."

Thus, “Mutton Mayhem" is a sheep herding
game, with three character types: sheep herders who
collect sheep, poachers who kill sheep and necroe

mancers who raise sheep from the dead. Each of
these character types alters thc supply of sheep for
the other types.

Bcc so of this “self-balancing" relationship, Ed-
wards said, the game and play vary quite a bit de
pending on how many people are playing and what
classes they are playing as. Edwards speculates that
this complexity helped his game win the Student
Showcase contest.

Edwards originally began designing and cod—
ing the game, which was written in C++, last year
at Grinncll. Partway into the project, however, Ede
wards' computer crashed, and all his work was lost.
When Edwards returned home during spring break
last year, he began working on the game again with
his friends

The group worked on “Mutton Mayhem" over
the break and here and there during the rest of the
year. Over the slimmer, they leatned of the Student
Showcase contest and decided to rush to finish the
game before the deadline.

Although they did not have time to put a single
player mode into the game as they had hoped, Ed-
wards and his friends did manage to polish many
aspects of the game. Edwards believes they caught
many of the bugs and errors that other entrants
might not have had the time to search for.

Edwards has always been interested in games of all
kinds, he said.When he was younger, he created board
games. During his sophomore year of high school, he
taught himself C++ and began designing computer
games. Edwards has designed several games, most or
which are available on his web page, firlnrbiapmdute
Iivrlr,mm. “Mutton Mayhem" is also currently availe
able on gamer/tamam, a popular video game website.

Edwards would like to continue working in game
development and plans to ﬁnd a career somewhere
in the ﬁeld once he leaves Grinnell, he said.

Edwards saw “Mutton Mayhem" as a test to see
if he and his team could successfully make a game
together. Now that they have created one game, they
are working on a new game, currently referred to as
“Code name: Dark."Edwz\rds described it as another-
economics action strategy game that will be “more
graphically and technically advanced” and also "pole
ished up and deeper" than ”Mutton Mayhem."

Choosing chairs

BY BRENDAN MACKIE
Have you ever noticed how uncomfortable most
Grinnell chairs are? Sure, i bet you’ve been in
class, half-asleep, and thought of the hard chair
beneath you as just another inconvenience, in be-
tween lack of coffee and inconsolable despair in im-
portance. As boring as chairs may be, everyone must

sit in them now and then. So to inform our community, |
undertook a survey of a couple of our seating options.

Those wooden

Comﬁness: I cannot imagine the
person who decided these chairs would
provide anything even remotely resem-
bling comfort to any human beingThcy
seem to be designed for a British public
school, or, barring that, a prison. When I
first sit in one, I can fool niysclfthal I’m
play for two, maybe 10, minutes.

But as soon
as l gel to the
point in the lesson
where I have to
start pay
tion, I 1
butt is hmnﬁcally
pamlyzed horn
sitting in a chair three sizes too small for
a hobbit.

I spend the next 50 minutes shift-
ing my weight from one butt chcek to
another in an attempt to kick-start the
ﬂow of blood to the lower half of my
body, so that when the lesson linally tine
ishes, I can stumble out the door with
enough dignity for \hc cute girl in the
hack ol’rhc class to not think I'm ‘d dick.

chairs in ARH

God, they could have at least put a ntcle
ing cushion somewhere. Cornﬁness:
2/10

Practical consideration: One of the
armrests or each chair has been magi»
cally turned into a table or sorts, thus
eliminating any need tor real tablcsl I
appreciate the functionality of this fear
trite but cannot help thinking that these
chairs are relics
from some Cold
Warrcra streame
lining initiative in
which a Repub-
lican government decided tables were
useless frivollties, Whatever. It's cute, in
a kinda kitschy wiry. Practicality: 6/10

General coolness: If you take a left-
hnnded chair and a right-handed chair
and put them together, you can pretend
you're sitting in a throne! You can have
literally hours of enjoyment ln‘mgln’
ing yourself sortie ' g and the rest of
the class lowly se ,ust make sun: the
protessor docsn‘t notice you looking too
sinugl Coolness: s/lo

Those red chairs in‘the Forum

Comﬁness: These chairs look ins
noccnt enough. Even when I ﬁrst sit in
one, 1 reel ﬁne. But as soon as I get nice
and relaxed, rake the introductory sip of
my coffee, open up my book and begin
my reading,1 realize that the chair sucks.
The backrest is made of gloriﬁed chick»
en wire, and after a hmldﬁll ofhours site
ting and studying, it imprints a pattern
on your skin. And, while the chairs are
perfectly comfortable while you're sitting
up snaighr,as soon as you lean forward or
cross your legs, the marvelously designed
arty chair decides to wreck vengeance on
your body. Conrﬁnesst4/10

Practical consideration: I have
lost days of studying to these chairs. I

sit down hoping to get work done and
spend the next four hours convincing
myseltrhat I'm actually comfortable and
attempting to keep up a deccnt posture
so my back doesn't break. I then 5th
back home with a bad back to collapse
in my bed and weep because I'm such a
wimp. Plus: there's no place to put your
books! Practicality: 3/10

General coolness: I can imagine
captain Kirk testing in one of these
chairs in some alien's space statiorr,drink—
ing some multiecolored drink. They are
very ‘705 space age/retro. They are Grine
nell‘s high-fashion chairs: they make you
look really cool when you sit in them but
hurt like a bitch, Coolrtess: 7/10
