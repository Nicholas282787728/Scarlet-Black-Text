Baseball triumphs vs. Knox

NICK HECKER

The Pioneer baseball

Doubleheader with lllinois College is next; Pioneers back in the playoff chase

BY JUsTlN WALLACE _

After sweeping conference foe Knox in a home
doubleheader last Saturday, the Pioneer baseball team
split a Monday doubleheader with local rival Central
College to move their record to 65 since their Flore
ida training trip,

In the first game against Knox, sophomore right—
hander Bow Brannon pitched a complete game, al-
lowing only a single run on four hits, to lead Grinnell
to a comfortable (r1 victory. The score was tied after
two innings, but a threerrun Pioneer third inning,
capped by a Leo Martin ‘06 triple, put the game out
of the Prairie Fire's reach,

Martin started the second game on the mound
and hurled seven stiong innings to lead Grinnell to an
8-5 win. Martin allowed only two hits and no earned
runs, although four unearned runs were scored Thc
Pioneer offense pounded out ten hits, including two

doubles by Chris Villa ‘05, to overcome Knox's den
pleted pitching staff.

On Monday against a perennially strong Central
club, Mark Henry ‘05 threw Six strong innings and
went sea from the plate to lead Grinnell to s H split.
Junior Kevin Byrne hit a threetrun blast with two out
in the bottom of the third to lead the Pioneer’s ofr
fensive attack.

thn asked if Henry's strong performance on
the mound last weekend was surprising, tlcvcnthryear
coach Tim Hollibaugh replied; “Not by any means. If
Mai-k were not an outstanding shortstop, he would be
pitching for us more often."

Conference rival Illinois College (3,3 MWC,
12—5 overall) comes into town next weekend, as the
Pioneers begin to airive at the meat oftheir schedule.
Grlnncll. also as in conference play, are only 942

“In regards to the overall records, it is hard to say
what they mean." Holliballgh said. “We’ve played a
difficult nonrconference schedule in order to better
prepare us for the conference season. We will learn
against Illinois College it’ that scheduling has paid
off"

Two wins against the Blue Boys would move
Grinnell to 5~3 in conference play, and put the Pier
neers ‘in position to make the Midwest Conference
tournament.

“[Iii order to get into the Conference tournar
merit], we have to take care ofbusiness this weekend."
Hollibaugh said. “This team has the physical talent
to beat anyone we step on the hold with in or out
of conference, It now comes down to the mental side
of the game Are they going to be prepared during
practice [this week] to compete at the highest level
on Saturday>"
