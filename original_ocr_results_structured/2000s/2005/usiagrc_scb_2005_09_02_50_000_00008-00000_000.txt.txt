Preview, cont. from (7.7

The 2005 Pioneer football team is
coming off one of the most successful
seasons in recent memory. A high
powered offense and a stingy defense
helped propel the 2004 team to a re—
speotable 6-4 record.

This season, under the leadership
of head coach Greg Wallace, who will
be entering his 18th season at the helm,
the scarlet and black will attempt to
build offoflast year.

“Last year was a very good year for
the Pioneer football team," said Wal—
lace, “but we graduated 16 seniors. we
are [now] a young football team, but
our new players have eome a long way
over the last two weeks.We are excited
to see what these new players mixed in
with the Veterans can do."

Among those key veterans isjunior
quarterback Sean Pfalzer. The Pioneer
signal-Caller is coming off his best year

KEVIN BVRNE

by far, having started in all 10 games,
completing 194 oflé‘? passes for 2,446
yards and 17 touchdowns. By the end
oftlic season, he led the Midwest con-
ference in passing yards per game and
aurpurpose yards per game, while also
amassing the most passing yards ofany
uarterback in the conference.

"The conference |S pretty tough this
season," said Pfalzcr, “We may not have
the same depth as most teams due to
our numbers, but the off-season and iri-
season conditioning has prepared us to
go strong through all four quarters,"

Pfalzer and company will get their
first chance to show how ready they are
on Saturday, when they travel up to Ri-
pon, Wisc. to take on the Ripon Red
Hawks. Grinnell stole the show last
year With a last-second touchdown to
beat Ripon 27rz4 on the Pioneer home
field.

WOME s GOLF

The women’s golf team hopes to
cement their place within the top five
schools in their conference this ycatr
Their goal is to surpass their fourth
place ﬁnish at the 2004 Midwest Cone
ferenee Championship. “1 look at us as a
top three team in the conference stand»
lugs,” said coach David Arseneault.

The Pioneers have a strong founda—
tion to build upon this year. The entire
2004 women's golf team has returned
for the upcoming season. There is also
some new blood in the lineup this year.
“We are adding two new players to the
list," Arseneault said. “Jordan Hcguy
[’09] from Denver and Amy Livingsr
ton ['09] from Illinois both have the

potential to make us better."

The team is taking the game more
seriously this season as well. “We’re
sliding towards being more competitive,
which is refreshing,” said Arsencault.

“The work ethic has improved. SEVT
eral players have worked very hard over
the summer, Haddie’s swing is much
better than it was a year ago and last
year she finished top 10 in the confer
ence."

Haddie Dowson'OS is one of severe
al undetclassmen who led the Pioneers
to their strong ﬁnish last year.

the season with a game on Saturday at

seasons ever. The 2004 Pioneers faced
Division 1 teams as well as several of

niors, a starting middle and a starting
opposite, Sonnichsen does not seem
worried. “l’m encouraged by the way
our team has practiced so far,” he said.

hard."

sense, The Pioneers have a new home

tion will be in the new gym," said Sons

a home court advantage we'll certainly
take it."
