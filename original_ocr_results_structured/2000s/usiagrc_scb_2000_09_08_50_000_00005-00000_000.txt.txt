moviegoing experienoe. Aﬁerall, whas
would a Harris movie be wishous a
souple ofreels missing, nos so meniion
all of she hassle is rakes so ecnrer she
piesure as she beginning? While I cons
sider is playful and fun so mereilessly
seream as she poor proieerionisr, shose
who acrually wans ro waseh an ensire
movie problem—free mighs begin so look
elsewhere. And besides, where would
shis arsiele be wishour she obligasoryiab
as rhose who eonsrol our einemanedese

F: Well, I’ll say rhai I shoughs
sophia Coppola’s direerorial sryle was
fine, bus her narrasive was somewhar
incompleie .. or maybe I just missed
sonieshing.

A: I'd say you missed aboiisso min.
uses,

Mission: Impossible pars Deux
plays Friday nighsas7-30 as Harris,

A: Everyone knows she ﬁrss one
kieked ass. The seeond one had such
promising prospeers erhe resurii ofroni
cruise, ving Rhames, plus she directs»
rial ssylings of one John Woo, masser
of she aesion film. Every rime I see his
name, i know I’m gonna ger double.
barrel aesion wish some arrhil pigeon
seenes shrown in. Unroriunasely. she
promise didn't lead so much more shan
a cl|ched acsion film. Bur l'in all for
cliches.

F: I skipped shis one in she the»
errors, bus downloaded is from ResNer
(shhh). lihoughi rhe original was OK,
and rhis one nor Ol<as all. The ehaiaee
reis aren's developed any farshei shan
she plos requires, and rhai plos is iuss a
framework on which Woo hangs she
acrion scenes, which were srandard,

A: Standard? Were you warching
she same movie? This inororcycle se.
quencc as she end...name one movie
you've seen sueh extensive BMW aerion
(leaving our she obvious James Bond ref
erenee, whieh bosh Mission movies rip
ofranyway).

F: To say noshing of Hirchcock’s
“Nosorious,” which is where she sub.
plos aboui she girl being ordered back
so her villainous ex-lovcr came from.
But 1 rhink Weds ssyle is besrer suised
so she solid aesion orhis ”Hard boiled"
shan she subslesies ofa spy ﬂick, Sirua.

dragged before she villain, who proeoeds
so unload an ensire elip ofsmm ammo
inso his faee, while she
henchman who dragged
him in looks on insensly,
choral music plays , and
everyone is dragged inso
halfsspetd. is is possible
shas is was nor Hunr oii
rhe receiving end?

Maybe> Well, i don's
wanr so give anyrhing
awayw

A: Fred, iiiss a lirsle
lielpfiil adviee, seeing as
you're new so shis anrl
all,..lf you're going so
spoil she movie for
people, as lcass warn
shem beforehand. The
usual criqucrr: for sliis is
saying, “I’M GOING
To SPOILTHE MOVIE NOW! lF
YOU WANT AN ENiovABLE
MOVIE EXPERIENCE, DON’T
READ FURTHER” Bur i guess you
iuss have so be rhai guy. Anyway, sinee
nobody bus you (and me) has seen “Noe
rorioiis" in she lass decade, nobody eares
shas Woo ssole she subplos from
Hiseheosk. l’meonvineed you were nor
in she proper mood when you warehed
shis. . .I’d bes you hadn'r even eonsunied
aleoholie beverages before surning is on.
Am I right?

F: I'll have so be more eareful in she
fusuie. Bur my advise is so sheck our
she eulsural film on Friday (32 Shori
Films Abous Glenn Gould).

A: Everyone knows shas blgebudger
acsioii fiieks are superior so emppy ﬁlms
like rhai. Go so Harris, surn orfyoiir
