Staying fit at Grinnell

When well-administered, intramural sports offer a chance to keep healthy amid winter’s woes

Last finals week,when classes were
supposed to have ended, Grinnell
enticed hundreds of students to take
a course left unlisted by the registrar
called “Eating Your Way to Happir
mess."

it began with the Pancake Study
Break and its glut of whipped cream,
powdered sugar, and chocolate syrup.

As the week progressed, the course-
load kept getting heavier as SAs, RLCs
and student groups ﬂooded South
Lounge and residence halls with junk
food and pizza.

It’s revealing that so many people
at Grinnell believe eating sugary and
greasy foods somehow improves stu-
dent life or functions as an appropriate
study break.

Thephcnom-
enon of viewing
these junk foods
as a curerall is
contagious. ,

In truth, the
cookies and pizza
make our heads
hurt and leave us le-
thargic.

When junk food is coupled with

winter weather, an unhealthy, seden-

tary lifestyle for students is often the
result.

Recently, however, there has been a
glimmer of hope from the likeliest of
places, the new PEC, bur from an un‘

Dodgcball, which was just intro-
duccd this year, nicely complements
other popular intramural offerings in
football and basketball.

We encourage intramural organiz-
ers to offer one more ﬁrst semester
sport so that students can remain aCs
tive year round by playing intramu-
rals.

Of course, to be effective, the sports
have to be properly administered.

Unfortunately, this year, the intra-
mural football season started late and
was cut short because of poor planning
on the part of ("gas
nizers.

Intramural or»

dodgeball.

The sport was
wellepublicized and
has run smoothly thus far. Hopefully,
we will be able to say the same for bas-
ketball come spring.

Promoting reylccing at Grinnell

The recycling program at Grinnell College has
come a long waysince its inception in the residence
halls and campus»owncd houses in 1991; it has also
received a lot of attention in the 5558,

In November 2000, two students publicly called
for more recycling containers and a general improve-
ment ot’the program.

In April 2001, a subgroup of the Environmental
Action Group and Mike Burt in Facilities Manage
ment wrote a letter to the campus community about
the amount of contamination in campus recycling
bins and its negative effects on the program.

December 2002 brought about an article regard

The progmm has evolved enough for the college

Campusrwide, however, it appears that only about
20 percent of trash is currently recycled; more accur
rate estimates will be available in
April at the end ofthe contest.

The key to a successful recyr
cling program at Grinnell College
is responsible recycling. Contam-
ination is still an ongoing probe
lem.

Trash in the bins or canrcans
and mixed recycling insures that
cite whole bag will get thrown
away.

However, some recent changes have occurred to
comply with the City of Grinnell’s recycling stuns
dards and to mikc recycling easier.

These include combining colored and white of-
{ice paper in the same bin, combining magazines and
newspaper, and putting brown and green glass in the
redeemable bin instead ofin with clear glass.

So next time you throw somcrhing away, look for
a recycling bin instead and make surt: it is the
correct one!
