At 1:25 am. on Nov. 4, Grinnell police are
rested Brett Maloney ’09 for assault, disorderly
conduct and interference. Tire following clay,
Maloney saw a judge who charged him with
two counts of criminal mischief in the third
degree and one count otassitult wrih no intent
ofinjury. His arraignment is scheduled for Jan.
11.

The arrest came after the Harris Hal-
loween party and after an earlier call to the
police to settle another dispute involving
Maloney “They had just left and were called
[hack]," said Cﬂpmln Theresa Peterson of the
Grinnell Police Department. The second call
came after Maloney allegedly assaulted RLC
Kim HindstEruslr, whose name is used with
permission. Jodi Mathttly, clrietotPolice, con-
ﬁrmed that in making the arrest, ofﬁcer's “did
deploy a taser."

Though claims of assault are not com-
mon on campus, when a violent crime is re»
ported, Grinnell administrators follow speciﬁc
policies to deal with the situation on campus.
students dealing with legal charges regarding
on-cnmpus behavior usually also face college
discipline.

Tom crady, vice president for Student Sets
vices, speaking in general, said in cases ofvioe
lence, a student is normally suspended with a
college Hearing Board meeting coming soon
after. While college ofﬁcials refused to conﬁrm
Maloney’s suspension, his name is no longer in
the college directory.

“it's a serious matter it’ people assault other
people," crady said. “it‘s not uncommon for
something like that to result in a suspension or
a dismissal from the college."

The College Hearing Board, made up or
three staﬂ’ members appointed by President
Russell Osgood, operates independently or
JndCo. Sheree Andrews, director of Residence
Life and crady advise the Hearing Board, and
its members are generally stuff or occasionally
faculty who are not teaching.

“The Hearing Board is generally harass-
ment, assault," said Andrews. “JudCo's more
of it violation of the community in terms of
alcohol and drugs.”

According to Crudy, Security brings cases
of assault or violence to Andrews, who then
hands the case over to the Hearing Board.

But in cases in which students fact: both 16*
gal and on—campus charges, thc Board's inect-
ings almost always occur before court dates,
This can be difﬁcult for students, who gener»
ally are advised not to speak until they're seen
in court.

“VVc [the Hearing Board] use the standard
ot’clcar and convincing cvidence,which is like
saying that it’s real clear that that it happened,”
said crady. “People have been interviewed
there’s cuts and bruises, there might be dams
aged things in the hallway, there's no question
that something happened."

In general. the college tries to handle is
sues of student behavior on campus rather
than involving the police, Crady said. “But if
someones hurt or in a dangerous situation,you
bet we're going to call the police."

Public intox levels on use? Maybe not

While public intoxication arrests are not necessarily increasing around campus, the lack
of clear regulations in state law makes enacting the policy ambiguous for local police

BYMATTZMUDKA

The Saturday after Thanksgiving was
supposed to be an ordinary night {or Megan
Nittenegger '08 as she walked home from a
downtown hat. As she neared home around
midnight, however, she was stopped by a po-
lice ofﬁcer. “It was a slippery and windy night
and he yelled again from beyond my periph-
eral vision," she said. “I slipped, and he more
in his report that l was drunk." Subsequently,
she was arrested for public intoxication.

Niti‘enegger, who was of legal age, is not
alone in her experience, Despite the seeming
invincible, seltegoverning nature oiiorinnell,
public intoxication arrests occur frequently in
Grinncll.

While snidcnts are relatively iininuno on-
campiis, the journey from downtown bars to
homes on or off campus can be dangerous.
And while public intoxication rates do not up
pear to be increasing, recent arrests highlight
many ofthe ploblcms created when a policy is
inherently ambiguous.

compounding problems with public in
toxicittion arrests among students is the can,
fusion that exists in Iowa law. Cutrcntly, the
Code oflowd states that"a person shall not be
intoxicated or simulate intoxication in a public
place," but does not actually give a deﬁnition
for intoxication or a necessary blood alcohol
concentration.

According to Jody Matherly, chiet’ of the
Grinnell Police Department, “That leaves it
wide open for interpretation. It comes back
down to the ofﬁcer using their training, their
experience and their judgment for enforcer
ment purposes."

In all of Poweshiek County (data was not
available for Grinncll or the college) there has
not been it dlscclnable rise in public intoxicas
tion arrests, 83 through the end of November
versus 100 all oilast year,

According to Mathcrly,
police do not speciﬁcally
target Gtinnell students for
enforcement of public in-
toxication laws. “We don't
target certain areas," hc said.
“we may do ti-nttic around
the bars." Matherly reiterr
atetl this point at a recent
Joint oard meeting, noting

Niffcnegger disagreed, and believes her or»

police oiliccr definitely pursued inc more once
he found out, when he had my ID, that l was
a Grinncll College strident," she said. “There
was a litany of drunk people crawling out of
bars. I would say that they were mainly non,

”it comes back down to the

Nirtennegger's experience also highlights
the dilemma students face when making
transportation choices after drinking down
down. “We’d rather have someone on foot than
operating a car," Mathcrly said, “That said. we
want to make sure people are getting home
safely on foot,"

However, the chance ofpublic intoxication
arrest makes walking home lcss viable“ “l was
drunk, but 1 saw no probable cause to appre-

vices available from the colt
loge. “It seems like there’s
not a reasonable option for
getting students the two
blocks between downtown
and campus," he said.

The security escort
service only serves people
returning to campus, leaving oft-campus stu-
dents to find their own ride. “There’s such a
heavy push on the students to not walk home
drunk and not to drive drunk but ifyou live
ottecampus, whlch is most people who are 21,
theies nothing really you can do." Pohanku
