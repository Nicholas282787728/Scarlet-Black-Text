Intermediate Sculpture

As Zach Dewitt '04 pointed out, when most people think
about a sculpture class, they think of clay. They would be
surpnised at this sculpture class, which employs a diversity
of media, from metaL work to video sculptures. Taught by
William Pefgl, intermediale Sculpture is only offered spring
semester: students need to take either Intro to Sculpture
or Ceramics hefole this course. Don't be intimidated by the
welding assignments; take the class for a chance to use
the entirety of each hand instead of the mere ten ﬁngers
required for typing a paper.

“1 think its really important [to take art classes]; it’s
another way to express myself creatively. Von get to work
with your hands, and with a different part or your
hrain..,1t's a nice change of pace from staring at a
computer screen, although we did do a video pioiecc,
which was kind-of stressful and involved a lot of computer
work...Welding is by far my favon'te part of the class...!'ve
never created anything so substantial before, something
that i can’t pick up by myself.” —Zach newm '04

So you want
to be an artist

t’s hard to try your hand at art if your creative niche
hasn’ t previously included it. Here are three courses
in the Theatre, Art, and Music departments that
deviate from what some might think of when they
think about ﬁne arts classes; you may discover a new

outlet for your savvy self.

Intro to ’Stage‘craft

uttered ooth fall and spn'ng semesters
without the hassle of a prerequisite, intro
to Stagecraft gives an introduction to
elements of theatre such as costuming,
makeup, lighting, sound design, dratting,
and much more. The course includes one
three—hour lali session per week, hut this
lab allows you to play with carpentry tools
and get sawdust all over your clothes as
opposed to running polyacrylamide get.
The class helps to construct sets tor theatre
productions, and each student is required to
work on a crew for one major theatdcai
perroimance during the semester. titer
taking stagecraic, students are qualiﬁed to
be a student start memher in the scene
shop, the costume shop, or the tax ofﬁce,
ihese positions are not only paid, but otter
valuable experience in different aspects of

theatre. Pip Gordon and En'k Sanning teach
this (lass.

”A lot of things that you learn in the
context or theatre you can apply in realistic
settings. For example, you can identity a lot
of things around your house: you can go to
your circuit box and see how many amps,
watts, and volts are running through it
pecause you know the formulas .The class
is not only a great introduction to all
different aspects of technical theatre, it
also applies them to the historical contexts
in whith they were developed, and the class
gives you a strong case in technical and
manual skills. We have people who take
stagecratt who go on to build houses or
hm‘dges.” iEliut Spencer ’05

Electronic music, which requires Harmony as a prerequisite, is practical,
technical, and artistic all at the same time. The two main software
programs used ior this class are Digital Performer, a Mini (Musical
instrument Digital Interface) program; and Pm Tools, a digital audio
program. Entering the electronic music lab, where the hulk or the work ior
this course occurs, is like walking into an egg carton with lots of shiny
objects and black cords strewn around. Take this class to enjoy sitting in a
room where no one will hear you scream if the thousands or electronic
chard: connecting the mixing hoard, Pm Tunis, electronic keybuard, CD
hurner and player, DAT player, microphone, and two sets or speakers decide

to take their revenge Juhn Chenette will teach you everything you need to
know and perhaps save you from the electronic monsters.

"From what I learned in the class, I could go out and produce a rock
hand. Well, no i couldn’t, because I don't have the experience, but you see
what i mean...i can take sounds, make sounds, and turn sounds into things
that they weren't. 1 can take the sound of somebodys voice, slow it down
eight times, and turn it into a groovin' hass line ior an acid house piece.
How cool is that?" — Jae Geni '05
