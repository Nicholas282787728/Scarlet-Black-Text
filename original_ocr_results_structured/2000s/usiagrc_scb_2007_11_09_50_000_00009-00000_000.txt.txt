Grinnellians caught in unhealthy downward spiral

In my four years on campus,l have noticed a harmful
trend: as individuals and as a student body, we deprioritize
health. Mentally, physically and emotionallywe are simply
too hard on ourselves, and furthermore unwilling to admit it.
We've stalled, and need to take a ﬁrst step toward a change.
We can and must do a better job oftaking care ofourselves
and those around us.

Pushing ourselves to within an inch of the brink has
become a mark of pride. We
compete to see who is the "better"
student by comparing hours slept
in the past week; if your total is
over 20, you’re automatically out
othe running.We drive ourselves
into the ground on the weekends,
with Harris parties. lots of alcohol
and morningsafter stress. For if you haven’t consumed
your weight in Jen-o shots in the past 24 hours, then you
clearly aren't worth your salt. And the number of times you
visit Out Takes in any given week is seen as mark of true
productivity; nutritional, sit-down meals are for the weak
The busier we are, the more were accomplishing, regardless
of quality or resulting anxiety level.

one ofthe most immediate negative consequences of
this culture is the effect it has on the important people in
our lives.When was the last time you talked to your grand
mother? It takes four minutes to write a quickletter. “Dear

Grandma,l was thinking ofyou and thoughtl would write
you a quick note. Iatc stewed peas in the Dining Hall today.
Hope you are enjoying the beautiful {all colors as much as 1
am. Love,\’out Favorite Grandkid."[n the words ofFTP,
“simple, easy and fun." Not to mention good for your mental
health and an allraround positive life choice.

We can't altord to ignore the people who mean the most
to us because we're too wrapped up in school. We'll be
wrapped up in school until the
day we graduate. A spare block
of time that can effectively be
used as "me" time isn’t going to
spontaneously pop up and take
a nip at your nose. It will take a
concerted effort to set aside time
to appreciate the people around
us, and it will likely come at some ntpense. But 1 think that
it is a sacriﬁce that is well worth it.

Clearly, there are times when you just leave put your
nose to the grindstone. That clghrrpugc history paper on
the Battle of the Little Bighorn isn’t going to research, write
and edit itself. On those nights, when academia needs to
come ﬁrst, every 107minute study break directly translates
into 10 less minutes ofsleep. And when you're banking on
a grand total ofthrce hours, 10 minutes is quite signiﬁcant.
But those nights should he the exceptions. And they are
fast becoming the rule.

Guest Column

We all take part in perpetuating this problem. As
aware as I try to be about almys treating myself well, I
still internalize and enable these harmful expectationsflhis
situation needs to be addressed both on an individual and
a campuhwide level.The solution is simple, but it is not
easy: taking time out to genuinely care for ourselves is both
necessary and ignored.'Ihe brutal irony is that, as hard aswe
are on ourselves,we're not even willing to admit that we’re
not OK. Acknowledging that you're sick, stressed, beaten
down, conﬂicted, depressed or in any other way unwell is a
confession that is seen as defeat. When I look around me,
I see a community that values the ability to sideline prob-
lems more than it values the ability to ﬁrst recognize that
something isn’t right and then do something about it.That's
just wrong. More than anything, we need to be supportive
when someone makes the difﬁcult and at this point deviant
choice to take a step back and/or ask for help.

This is an issue of concern for the whole campus. The
idea that school needs to supercede all other aspects of our
lives is pervasive and insidiousWe are people and friends
long before we are students. Appreciating that our classes
and even our attracurriculars inﬂuence do not deﬁne us will
require a major shift both in collective consciousness and
in everyday actions.

We are fully capable of making this change. All it re-
quires is ro take that ﬁrst, scary step and start. Ready. Go.

Solutibns to stress besides milk and cookies

Midsems are over—breathe a sigh of
relief! Throughout those long weeks, the
only things that kept us going were cook—
ies and milk in Butling, and the promise
we’d do a better job of working ahead
next time. But
when ﬁnals roll ‘
around, we’ll ,
inevitably face
marathon ses-
sions of papers

and tests again,

We allknow
that stress is
more than an
unpleasant reeling. By itself, it causes
mental and physical distress; add sleep
deprivation, and you're particularly vul-
nerable to being sickwhen you most need
to be well. Even more anadetynnducing,
the quality ofyourwork snftcrs from the
stress of academic anxiety and physical
illness. Just come by the publications
room on a Wednesday night to see some
of the horrors of stress.

StaﬁEdralitol‘ '

Academic stress can be particularly
frustrating, because we usually see it com—
ing. Unfortunately, many students aren’t
planning ahead. And nervont ﬁnd solutions
to academic anxietyby crossing our ﬁngers

a n d h o pi n g
that multiple
syllabi coin-
cidc nicely.
Grinneli gives
us the resourc-
es to deal with
foreseeable
s t r e s s 7b u t
these resourc»
cs are underutilized.

The Si‘iB is hardly known for unadulter-
ated praise of the administration. Or praise
at all. But then and again, the JRC third
floor can provide a lot. And as several of us
have discovered when we thoughtwe might
keel over from work, Student Affairs can
sometimes be warm and cuddly.

In partienlar,wc highly recommend the
resources in Academic Advising. Many of

 

us didn’t know what to do come midsems
week, until some of us tried a meeting with
Brad Menard or Joyce Stem. We all had
very positive experiences with the staff. who
dedicate their time to helping students plan
ahead The ofﬁce assists students in creat—
ing a schedule, chiciendy managing their
time and even finding a good study space.
Academic Advising also arranges tutors for
students who need them.

Stressful syllabi,ofcourse, aren’t the only
source of anticipatory anxiety Procrastinas
tion. depression or learning disabilities are
easiest to tackle when we plan aheadAgain,
Academic Advising can help in a one-on-
onc meeting or a group workshop'lhey can
also assist with academic concerns more
‘mguc than handling your current schedule,
like deciding on a major, ﬁnding an adviser
and devising a foursyear plan.

Even in last-minute emergencies, Aca—
demic Advising is an impormnt source for
helpThe oﬂiceworks with students on com,
inunicating with professors whereettensions
and rescheduling are needed for whatever

 

legitimate reason Academic Advising
helps students devise strategies for talk—
ing to professors outside ofclass, and will
communicate directly with professors
(usually via c-mail) if need be, assuring
the validity of student requests.

ideally, professors could suspend work
over break. or centrally coordinate the
timing ofmajor assignments. But profess
sorial freedom is valued too highly for an
administrative quick-ﬁx decreeAnd diat's
as it should be, at an institution that puts a
premium on intellectual exchanger

So Grinnellians shouldn't cross their
ﬁngers and hope that syllabi will coordis
nate themselves. It doesn't help to wait
imtil those last two stressful weeks before
finals to realize youie in over your head.
Throughout the year, Academic Advising
exists to meet with you and oﬂer advice to
make classes rnn a bit more smoothly.

Of course, if this method of stress—
management doesn’t appeal, we also rec-
ommend cookies and milk in Burling.
