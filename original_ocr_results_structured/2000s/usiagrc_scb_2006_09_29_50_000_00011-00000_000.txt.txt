While the fust- -_vcitr Ultimate Frisbee play-
cis did not actually suffer from lymphatic
filariasis they did get a chance to experience
“Elcphantitis” for the ﬁrst time last weekend
on Mac Field. The nniqnclyenamctl Ultimate
Frisbee tournament hosted by Grinnell wel-
comed 14 teams rom around the Midwest
represented by both men and women.

The meet was sanctioned by the Ultimate
Playch Association (UPA) and had an ens
trance fee of 5150 pct team. Grinnell ﬁelded
two teams with a focus on getting the new
players at much experience as possible.

“We have a lot of freshmen this year,"

said tournament director and participant
Noah Bindman '07, “So we decided to space
the teams out evenly between the people that
have been playing for a while and those who
haven’t.”

. In the past, Grinnéll has
ﬁelded ”A" and “B" squads that
were designed to make the "A"
team as competitive as post

designations signiﬁed that the bracket”
teams were more even in tal» '
ent,

“The guys ended up wins
ning the losets’bracket, which is

pretty fun despite it being the losers’ bracket,"

Bindman said. “The second day we put both
[Grinnell] teams together to form one big
force in the losers bracket, and we dominated
everyone."

Grinnell wasn't the only team at the tour»
namcnt that tried to give their younger plays
crs experience. Both of the [cams in the men’s
championship match, the Winona Experience
and Iowa State Ultimate, had the same strat-

pericncc Tim Corcoran said,“We tried to have
four Ieturners and thIee rookies on the ﬁeld
the entire time.”

Winona won six games in a row, four on
Friday and two on Saturday, to reach the men's
championship matchsup against Iowa State
Ultimate,

“We gave the freshmen playing time even
In the ﬁnals and we still kept It close," Iowa
State Ultimate’s Mike Lun said. “We had a
plan going in to give our young guys experi-
ence and we stuck with it and did wclIAthc

While Iowa State lost to Winona in the
men’s championship 1544, the Iowa State
women’s club beatTIuman in their champion—

Winona and the fourth
for Iowa State. Both
teams said the tournas
ment and the atmo—

“I hear the parties
are always great." Lun
said. “I never go, but
the players that do alt

had a great time."

Tournament directors Bindman, Misha
thtmann ’07, and Arie Pearson ’07 not only
planned a party Saturday night for players and
teams, but also gave the champions a victory

"We gave the winning teams a couple of

really crappy wine."

Millikin University lnvite' In Decatur, Ill.

“A big part of golf Is the mental game You have to learn
to let It go and move on, ”said Goggin of the stress of hitting
a bad shot. “It s a huge strength because a limited number of
people are able to do that” ,

Daily practices begin with chipping and putting at
Grinnell Golf and Country Club, important skills because

Japinga: Drop the football team

BY MARK JAPINGA

The football team is adveItised as the pinnacle of any col~
lcgc's athletic program. Each Saturday's home game is designed
to unite students around their classmates’epic on-field battle.

The quality of the football team is a statement of pride
amongst both students and alumni, who follow the team for
the rest of their lives. Success on the ﬁeld translates into more
alumni donations, more prospective student applications and
greater school visibility and status.

Funny, I don't see our football team coming close to ﬁtting
that description.

Instead, the football team is a converse»
tion topic that evokes eye rolling and cringe
ing, and it's easy to see why. A In? record last
year is bad cnough.Whnt's worse Is that last

loser John Kerry, whose sarcastic dubbing of
Grinnell as a football powerhouse Icccivcd
uproarious applause.

With the football team showing no signs
of improvement (0-4 this year with a defense
determined to allow as many points as the
men's basketball tcclm),1 propose a measure
that 1 have not yet hcard on campus: 1ct’s drop the football
team.

Blasphemy? it's not like anyone would miss them. Qiicki
name Grinnell’s leading rusher. Better yet, name the coach,

Stumped? Most Grinnellians probably are. Last year's box
scores show that an average of 400 people attended last year's
losses, the lowest in the conference. Our anemic crowds beg the
question,“lfQB scan Pfalzct gets sacked by three defenders at
the 50»yatd line and no one is there to see it, will he still have
a concussion ?”

so what happens when Grinnell looks at campus apathy
and drops the sooepound athletic department gorilla knoWn

”lt’i time for {be adminiilmlion

year's most memorable momentcamc not on m “(iplagleﬁélW/l by dléié’dafdr

(ll/{flies ofa poor football learn,”

as the football program? Other sports will rcccivc a share of
the football budget. These other spoils actually win conference
titles and give Grinnell’s athletic progiam a good name.

The monetary share that football hoaIds is significant.
National surveys conducted by the NCAA clearly show that
football programs command more dollars than any other sport,
even at the division III level. Football teams have higher-paid
coaches, more staff, higher recruiting budgets and require more
ﬁt as than any other sport,

Using that money for Grinnell’s proficient athletic teams
can bring those programs to the next level.Whatwould beneﬁt

Grinnell more: hiring more coaches and ex
panding recruiting for what 'tports we have
left, turning perennial conferencerwinning
sports like women‘s soccer, eIoss country
and swimming and diving into bigger play-
crs on the national scene? Or recruiting
a couple of Joe Linebackers to make the
football team 278 instead of 0710>

Let's face it, the football team has
reached the point where its only benefit to
campus is the salute to Frank Sinatra every
December.

It’s time for the administration to act
progressively by disregarding our stereotypical ”need" for a
football team and doing what’s best for all of Grinnell athlet-
ics: releasing the school from the money-guzzling clutches ofa
poor football team.

Maybe the next time a has-been politician is on campus,
he can congratulate us for our national success in soccer or
swimming instead of taking an easy potshot at out most glatt
Ing fault.
