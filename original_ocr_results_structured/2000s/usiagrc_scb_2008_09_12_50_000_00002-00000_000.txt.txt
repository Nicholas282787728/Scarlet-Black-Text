Andiews's status at the school was first disseminated to Stuv

RLCs held meetings to inform their staffs. However, the SAs
were given no further information about the circumstances be-
yond the fact that she was on leave.

Since diat night, no further information has been provided to
Student Staff or SGA. Due to the lack ofinformation provided
to students, and the confidentiality oftllt: situation, it is unclear
when Andrews's status with the school will be fully resolved.
