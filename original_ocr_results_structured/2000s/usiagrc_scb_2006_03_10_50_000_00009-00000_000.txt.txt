Conscientious Patriots and the Peace March
struggle with low student participation

BY KATIE MCMULLEN

If President Bush gave the order
tomorrow, a draft could be fully operar
tionul in 75 days.

Aware of the very real possibility of
Selective Service in the United States,
members of the Grinnell community
formed Conscientious Patriots last
winter, a group committed to encour—
aging reﬂection and dialogie about war
and the option ofbelng a eonselentious
objector (CO).

Conscientious objection is deﬁned
as it sincere conviction, motivated by
conscience, that forbids someone from
taking part in organized killing and
legally recognized by the us. govern
ment.

“We’re not saying everybody who
runs Selective Service is the enemy or
villains or anything," Charles Pope, vicr
ar of St. Paul's Episcopal Church and
co-founder of the group, said. “Vi/Ere
just saying that as Americans, there is
[a] choice. On the law there is the
option to object to going to wai."

Pope formed the group last winter
with several other local ministers. The
groilp holds monthly events about the
war in Iraq and possibility of a draft,
such as speakers and ﬁlm screenings,
but have considered going to every
other month because of low turnout.

“We don't know why snidents aren't
responding like we hoped they would,"

Pope said. "All we’re saying is we want
yoil to think about the pros and cons,
[and] where you smnd with this. lryou
want to go tight, then choose to do that,
but think ahead.”

Morgan Wajda-Levie ’08, a mem-
ber of Conscientious Patriots, is .i cone
scientious resistor, meaning he refuses
to even register for the draft, and came
to Grinnell partly because it promised
to pick up the tab for loans the govern-
ment will not provide to resistors.

”There is a strong sense of attior
tisnl and certainly nationalism in the
U.S.], so [the group is] trying to scpae
rate that from militarism and say that
there’s more to patriotism than war and
ﬁghting in war," he said.

Pope said he is motivated by his eye
perience during the Vietnam War.

“We were all telrified as high

t~scliool students," he said. “The closer
to graduation we all got, the more (Ctr
lified we got. We didn‘t lealize there
were any options. "

Group members are willing to dis
cuss the war and implications of the
draft with anyone, regardless of their
stance on participation.

Conscientious Patriots also provides
individuals With proof of their interest
in peace-oriented events and assists
students in the creation of a CO file

“If you wind up being a conscienr
tious objector, you’re going to have to

prove it to a draft board. You're going
to have to provide a file that shows lon-
gevity,” said Pope.

Conscientious Patriots members are
not alone in trying to raise awareness of
the implications of war. Every Thurs-
day a group ofstudents and statrgarher
at Herrick Chapel for a Peace March,

The point is not tint we are a small
group in Grinnell, Iowa . ..but that we
are one or many groups of hopefully
hundreds of thousands across the nae
tion who are actively protesting for
peace" said Emily Kugisnkj ’09.

The marches began in the spring of
2005. Faculty members were the drin
ing force in organizing the march.

“A lot of [faculty members], like

myself, [are] relies from the 1960s who
were somewhat disturbed by the lack of
activism among students today in the
face ota war that's just as outrageous
in many ways as the Vietnam war was,"
Kent McClelland, Sociology, said.

Despite the direct effect war can
have on students, they have had difﬁ’
culty gaining student participation on
campus.

“[Students’] attention needs to
be dragged to the fact that this war is
dragging on, [that] it was started on
false pretenses, [that] it's been a truly
disastrous policy for the Us. and that
it affects them and that they should be
doing something about it,”McClelland
said.
