Adapting back to Grinnell

It can be hard to come back; that’s why movies about troubled people and war are on campus this weekend.

Bradley: Man, spring Breaksure was relaxing. And for me,
at least, the break continued into this weekil only had
two huge papers duc, Fortunately, my mental breakdown

B. it's deceptively easy to categorize dais movie in which
thestar plays the rwrn screenwriters that wrote the movie.

wrote a hook that this movie is oh so loosely based on.
What category does it fall into? Astoundingly good.

Jeremy. or perhaps just gimmicky. Nick cage doo
play screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, who in real life wrote
the ﬁlm with his ﬁctitious brother Donald. Confusing?
The premise oiaidaprrorori is that as Kaufman struggles to
write a ﬁlm based on a plotless book, The Orv/rid T/m/hy
Susan Orlean (Meryl Sneep), he ﬁnds he has written him»

B: Also part ofrhe movie, thanks to ﬂashbacks, is oilean
interviewing iohn Laroche (Chris Cooper), die gregarious
titular orchid thief All three main actors were nominated
for Oscars. but Cooper was the only one
to win. it’s wrong to say that he steals
every scene he's in, because all of the
acting is phenomenal.

JzThe first two thirds ofrhis
movie is great. cage is fun to
watch (rare in itself), the
storytelling devices are on
the mark, and there are
many intriguing ideas. ’
Burright around me time

Sam Cramer '04 is the ﬁrst to admit it. “There’s no
reason we should be on the air."

Both he and fellow D] Leah Bry ‘04 freely acknowl-
edge their flagrant disregard for certain FCC regulations.
“We playstuffrhat would violate the FCC rulcS four times
a show," Bry said.

They are also quick to point out that any listener rune
ing into “The Return ofSydxilla" in search of musical cor
heience Will he disappointedTheirshow, which allSTi‘lurs»
day morning from 11- 12:30, strives for something greater.

“Other DJ's like to pick themes," Cramer said. “We’re
breaking down the walls of genre, man. We're tearing it
the underbelly of mtcgoriution."

“And we're pretentious," Bry added.

While quick to deny that they adhere to any particular
genre, Bry and Cramer agree that there is an underlying
element to their show—“whimsy.” They also agree, and
want to make sure everyone understands, “We like to play
the punk rock."

Another underlying theme of the
show seems to be sex. Between the Bic
kini Kill song “Suck My Left one" and
the subtly erotic “Superscx” by Mot.
phine, the show is somewhat sexually
charged, or, as the DJ’s describe ir, “liotr
with two t’s." “Superstit” has additional
merit, according to Cramer. “It rust
drives," he said. “And plus, it talks
about Bill Clinton having ‘xupcr super super scr,’ so it’s
got eultni-sl value as well."

When asked about the musical interests ofthelr inno» -

cent youth, Bry admits that her first tape was The 5/91 by
Ace by Base. Cramer raiused to comment on his ﬁrst al.
bums, saying he'd nrher keep his “dirty secrets." However,
Bry speculates that his fiisr CD was The sign, me.
Despite their sclfeeffdcement and questionable early
musical tastes, Cramer and Bry seem to know what they're
doing. Theirselections are undoubtedly cclecric. Beethoven,

time. Bry and Cramer are well informed and opinione
ated enough to debate the merits oiMoaart, Patsy Cline,
and lots ofpeople in between. (Their Consensus? Mozart
is technioilly good, but somewhat "ﬂippanr" when com.
pared to Bccdloven. And parsy Cline,
though she doesn‘t quite “iive,” is not
had.)

While their mmial standards are
generally high, Bry and Cramer Dc»
casionaiiy indulge themselves. When
playing a song by the cosmic
Roughridets, a band whose obscu»
rity is probably ior the best, Cramer
coniessed, “rm so ashamed I like d-iis music because it's
so vapid." .

Despite their roekehard, or hard rock, exterior: and
high aesthetic standards, Bryand Cramer have theirown
soft underbelly. “Sydzilla” refers to bry‘s car. Sidney. The
ear, Cramer said, is a major selling point of the show.
“it's named after the cutest tat in the world, so why
wouidnt you listen, really?"

For those who need another reason to listen, Bry
promises, “We'll rock you like a roiiercoorer."
