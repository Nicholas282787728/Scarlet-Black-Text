The Grinnell Women's Christian
Temperance Union was indignanr.

“Are the moral standards of the Col-
lege to be lowercd?"tliey wrote in the stab
in 1914. Lomcming the rise ofsmoking
among rlioboysofcrinncll Collcgc,zhesc
women bopcd ro convert college boys ro
"clean habits."

But as far back as the 19205 Griiiiicll
students were often more interested in
being cool. In 1928, an SEE editorial
noted that, “girls smoke because it is sup-
posodly the rasbionablo rbing to do: they
are termed ‘old fogy' ifthcy dork."

Though women were smoking. men
could smoke in their dorms while women
were only allowed to smoke in the Hailies
Pit lounge. A struggle ensued. A headline
from 1934 declared that “Recent Action

ofGovcmilig Body Ends Coeds Figbr for
Fag Freedom."allowing women to smoke
in public, and in the men's lounges on
North campus. By the midisos, an sol;
statistician reported that women account-
ed for halfof Grinnell Cigarette sides.

Students and professors lit up in resi-
dents halls, academic buildings, at Biirling
Library and in the dining halls for decades.
“At the time it wasn’t an act of defiance,"
said Don Smith, History, “I: was just what
people did."

But in the 705 and 80:, anti-smoking
advocates began to speak up. In 1978,
a letter to the S53 noted that though
rbere were designared areas in the dining
halls for smokers and nonesmokcrs, some
smokers would “forget" and light up at
will. smoking in classmoms wils phased
out in the late 19705, but professois still

smoked in their ofﬁces. “Many people
thought that a professor's oiﬁce was bis or
her eastle,"said Smitli,"and that a profess
sor should be able to smoke there."

Opposition to smoking persisted,and
students held a Smokeoiit in the Foium in
November 1986, with no smoking allowed
for 24 hours. In 1987,tobacco sales in the
campus booksrore were banned because
they wenr against the college’s omcial
nonsmoking policy.

compromises and new provisions {or
smoking and non-smoking spaces wele
instituted throughout the 805 and 90s.
“When we built the Harris Center we
decided that it would be nonsmoking to
begin with." said Tom Crady. Crady said
that cost played a large role in this decir
sion, citing costs the college incuired when
Bob‘s Underground allowed smoking.
