Swimmers host MWC championships

Ev ELI BEST

The swimming and diving teams took to the pool for a final
ninetup last Saturday in preparation for this weekend's MWC
championship meet.

Both teams earned victories in Dubuquc, IA over Loras
College, with the women taking the meet 153-79 and the men
eruisrrig to a 157 70 win.

We were really happy with our results coach Erin Hurley
said. we had some awesome swims tor that time ofyear

When the MWC championships kick oiftoday, the women
will be looking for their ninthrsu'alghr conference champions
ship and the men will be looking for their sixth in a row. Both
teams are approaching the meet with confidence but are being
careful not to crown themselves prematurely.

"ﬁvmtime Midwest Conference Performer of the Week
Meghan McDaniel '10 believes she and her teammates are
ready for the meet.

“We have trained hard, and we are ready to do some out-
standing things in the pool,” she said.

Senior Nate Kimball shares McDoniel’s conﬁdence in his
team's level of preparation. “Each swimmer [has] set themselves
up for incredible swims,“ he said. “Extremely few swimmers
have poor performances during Conference. "

On the men’s side, Lake Forest and Monmouth look to be
the biggest threats to the Pioneers' bid for another champions
ship. Both could provide a bigger challenge than the men have
faced in other years of their Streak» The women will have to
ﬁght off strong (cams from Lawrence. Carroll, St. Norbert and

Lake Forest.

Tlierc are several MWC champions returning for both
Pioneer squads. Valerie Stlmac '09, Erinn Croco '07, Amanda
Kolcdjian '08 and Julia McHugh '07 will be looking to repeat
for the women, while Nate Kimball '07, Nate VVittnam ’09 and
Kevin Wood '07 will look to do the same for the men.

But the Pioneers will need Strong finishes from more than
just the top swimmers if they are to take home the trophy, and
coach Erin Hurley points to stiengrh of Grinnell‘s teams from
top to bottom as an advantage. “A lot ofthe schools have great
swimmers," she said. “But i don't think anyone can show up
with the depth we have ”

The team’s focus for the final days orpractice is ﬁllertunr
ing training and getting some rest. Leading up to the meet, the
length and intensity ofthe workouts decreases dramatically and
the Pioneers pay more attention to smaller details.

“we have spent more time with our relay exchanges and
starts,” Hurley said.

Along with the physical training and rest, the Pioneers are
preparing themselves tor the meet mentally “We ve done some
relaxation training, Hurley said “[Wc have] done some pretty
fun bonding rituals."

Grinnell has the psychological advantage of hosting the
meet For over A week. Obermiller Pool has been set up as it
will be for the Conference meet, giving the Pioneers the op—
portunity to practice within the tract setting of the big meet.

The meet begins at 10 a.m. this morning and will continue
through Sunday.

Sports Analysrs

BY PATRlCK RITTER

“The system" started over fifteen years
ago as a way for some lowly Grinnell hoops
teams to have fun playing, win or lose, and to
occasionally sneak out some wrns against more
talented teams along the way. A lot of people
found it extreme, and some saw it as a “bas-
tardization" of the game.

But sometimes you have to do whatever it
takes to win.

Fast forward from the days of corduroy
jeans and bad Grinnell basketball to last Sal’s
ur-day in thc new Darby Gym. The Pioneers
dismantled what was supposed to be a formi-
dable St, Norbert team, a day after they led in
40 minutes against a Carroll team that had en—
tered the weekend tied for the MWC lead.

The game started out close enough, with
the Pioneers trailing 15—17 six minutes into
the first half. Then the iout was on. Backttot

MWC, led by David Arsencault '09, who
seems to never turn the ball over and who
makes just about everything within fifteen
feet. John Grotbcrg 09 has legit 25 foot range
and' is quick enough to get open against den

Wing player Doug Ticus '07 is one of the
most underrated players on the court, and he
does everything on the court except shoot the
longball. He rebounds, blocks shots, scores
around the basket and has the athleticism and
instinct to average nearly four steals a game.

Keith Chamberlain '08 has blossomed
fiom an awkwaid and newous offensive li-
ab ty when he stepped on campus into a
well- 'rounded big man. Not only does he block
shots and hit the offensive boards, he also' is
skilled enough on the low block to demand a
lot ofattention when the ball is in his hands.

Long has become much more consistent
with his outside shot this season. VVingmen
Schmidt and Trek Langenhan '07 serve as value
able outside shooters, while guard Sean Pfalzer
‘07 brings ballhandlmg skills along with some
athleticism and a tpiicktieleasejump shot.

Women’s hoops team eliminated from tourney, plays pressure-free

xv NATE LINDSEY
The women’s basketball team fell victim to the St. Norbert
Green Knights last Saturday at Darby, 7458.
But the Pioneers are going into their last three games with
a positive attitude, starring when they host Lake Forest tomor-
row at 1 p m
Hannah Wolf'08 led the team with 23 points against St.
Norbert, with Katie Schumacher 08 chipping in 13. Grinnell
pulled out to an early 11 5 lead thanks to three- -pointers from
Shumacher and Mikiy Nakamum '10. But that lead quickly win-
ished, and Grinnell could not cut the St, Norbert lead to loss

than six during the second halfThe loss was the fourth straight
for the Pioneers, and the going does not get any easier against
a Lake Forest team that is 12,1 in the MWC and won the first
meeting between the teams by24.

“Our team’s goals for the remainder of the season are to
strive to play our best basketball [and] to finish out the season
on a positive note,”Jodi Watkins ’09 said.

The season has had its positive notes to this point, particu-
larly a 57-55 victory over Lawrence University (9-4 MWC) on
Jan. 12.

“our successes in the games we have won are deﬁnitely that

we played together as a team,“ Watkins said. “The weaknesses
in our losses was that we didn’t come to play Many games we
smrted slow and dug ourselves a hole."

Grinnell heads into the game against Lake Forest with little
pressure, having been eliminated from making the WC tours
nament. The Pioneers hope to play relaxed and keep their effort
level high

“I think that a lot of us are looking at it like we have noth-
ing to lose, so we arejust going to go out and give it everything
we have,"Haddie Dowson ‘08 said. “Try to have some fun and
maybe we will come out on top”
