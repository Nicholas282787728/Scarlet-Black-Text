Cold War'role reversals abound in-Olympic Hookey'

These 2010 Winter Olympics is perhaps
the most anticipated event in the history ofin-
ternau'onal ice hockey. Why? Well, it helps that
the games take place in Canada, rhe birthplace
of hockey and home nation to approximately
so percent of the National Hockey
League The best way 1 can de-
scribe Lhe popularity ofice hockey
in Canada is this: if football,
baseball and basketball made
love and conceived a love-child
superssport containing only the
elements of each game that ev-
eryone likes...thar sport would
still not be as popular in America
as ice hockey is in Canada, How
ever, these are not the ﬁrst winter
games in Canada, and the host
nation is not the only reason why
this ice hockey tournament
holds such promise.

No, what makes these
particular games so special
is the parity. Canada, Rus-
sia, USA and defending
champion Sweden may have
fielded their best teams ever,
and all of these nations have
a legitimate shor at a gold .
medal. Below these four nations he a multitude
of countries with top—end NHL talent on their
rosters, chomping at the bit to upset one of the
big four. The Slovakian Team, a team not even
expected to finish in rhe rop five, still boasts
13 NHL players and three more former NHL

players on their 23-man roster. In facr, I think

it is pretty evident that the global diversity of

the NHL has caused a ‘closing-or-thesgap; in

international play. Twenty years ago, roughly

10 percent of players in the NHL hailed from

outside North America. Today, that num-

ber is somewhere around 40%Fthe

openness to diversity rhar rhe

NHL exhibits has allowed the

best players in the world to play

against each other, regardless of

nationality This has allowed a

small nation that may not boast

the same resources as Canada

and USA, such as Slovakia, to

eompere successfully. I could go

on about the implications of the

inﬂux of inremational players into

American leagues, but I would

much rather break down some
sweet hockey Eeams.

Personally, I am root-

ing for Team Russia. othen

wise known as the Moscow

Capitals, Red Red Wings,

or .the Kremlin Kings. How

can 1 turn my-back on the

USA. you may ask? Simple,

my allegiance lies ﬁrst and-

foremost to the NHL’s best team, my home—

town Washington Capitals. Three Caps will

suit up for Russia in Vancouver, including the

best hockey player in the world, Winger Ala

stander Ovechkin. If you still haven’t heard of

the Great Eight, he’s basically LeBron James

on skates, At 6'2" and 235 lbs., 0V is the pet»
fect combination of size and speed, and he also
happens to have a wicked wrist shot. The other
winger on Ovechkin’s line is another Capi—
ral, Alexander Semin, aka. Captain Dangles.
Centering these two teammates will be a man
who arguably possesses the best ice-vision in
the entire league, Detroit Red Wing, Pavel
Datsyuk Though Russia has always had the
firepower, what makes this year different is that
Russia finally has the goaltending to make up
for a suspect defense. San Jose Sharks Goals
render Evgeni Nabokov is in the prime of his
career at the ripe old age of 34. He is ranked
in therop five of the NHL in save percentage,
goals against average and wins. We'll see how
he handles playing in front of a less-than-srels
lar defense.

While Russia may be the most top-heavy
team in terms of talent, Canada deﬁnitely
boasts the best roster from topstoebottom. Chi—
eago Blackhawk fans, this is your team. Center
Jonathan Toews, Defenseman Duncan Keith

‘and Defenseman Brent Seabrook will all suit

up for Canada. Pur rogether by. NHL legend
and Canada General Manager Steve Yzetman,
this team is the perfect mix ofscoring and de-
fense, finesse and power, youth and experience.
I have a huge grudge against Yzerman because
he left Capitals' Defenseman Mike _ Green,
the best scoring defenseman in the leagie, off
the roster. I guess he figured that Canada had
enough scoring up front wirh their impressive
stable of forwards—I can’t really blame him
for thatiCanada hns Forwards Joe Thornton,

Patrick Marleau, Dany Hearley‘, Sidney “not
Ovechkin, bur still a hockey god" Crosby. Be-
tween the pipes theyie solid—the best goalie
in the history of hockey, Martin Brodeur, will
start for Team Canada. There is no weakness in
this team, not a single chink in the armor, and
yet 1 do not think Canada will win the gold.
This is partly because ofthe whole Mike Green
situation but mainly because I rhink the pres
sure to win a gold in front of the hometown
crowd will get to them and they’ll choke.

Clearly Russia and Canada are the two
best teams, but Sweden and the United States
are not far behind. Not only are the Swedes
the most attractive team on the ice, but they
are loaded with scorers, including my boy
Center Nicklas Baeksrrom, another Capital.
The Swedes have four Red Wings on the ros-
tet, smack dab in the middle of an era of Red
Wings dominance, which explains why they
won the Gold in 2006.Team "Miracles are for
an older generation" or the United States is an
intriguing team because this team is loaded
with under—thc-riidar NHL talent and fantas-
ric goaltending. 1 know you Blackhawks fans
are proud to see Winger Patrick Kane suit up
for the Red, White and Blue. Ryan Miller at
the goalie spot for America should help temper
the offensive onslaught of Canada and Russia,
but alas, this team is bound for a tragic ending
offrhe podium. ~

When Ross Preston '10 saw the Gtinnell Men’s Basketball
earn play in the ﬁrst Division III regularsseason basketball
game ever aired on ESPN in Pebnrary 2005, he know thar plays
rig for the Pioneers would be a special experience,

“They didn't even win the game, but that it was that style
fbasketball that 1 just immediarely fell in love with,” Preston
‘aid. "And when I realized that Grinnell was the kind ofschool
wanted to go to anyway, it was just a dream come true in that

ago, and many wins later Preston and fellow senior John ans

owe'ver, the Pioneer squad (6-15, 4—10 in the Midwest Cons
erence) faced serious adversity after losing last year's talented
enior class to graduation.

“Last year we had three superlative offensive pluyers in my
on [David Arsenault], john Grotberg and Bobby Long who
ever panicked if we fell behind,” Head Coach David Arse-
neaul‘t wrote in an e-mail. “They knew thatrhey had the ability
o score in bunches and usually did.This year's group tends to
orry too much when we go ‘cold’ and tends to lose offensive
confidence quickly."

Bruns explained that this team’s youth made it difﬁcult to
ecute the system on a consistent basis.
“When your core is a freshman class ofeighr gniys that have

ar basketball, and you're relling them, ‘Hey, go play system ball
and score 130 points,‘ that's really hard,”ans said.

With so many young players on this year’s team, Couch
Arsenault called on Bruns and Preston to step into leadership
oles. ,

“l rhink that's been one ofmy favorite things about this year-
s getting to know all of [the fust—yeru plriycrs]."Prcst aid.
‘l've tried to be kind of a big brother to them, in the of

ave arrived at the finale of their collegiate carccrs.This season, .

never played system ball and are coming out from playing regu- .

sarily as someone that has been a leading scorer, but as someon
who has watched several people succeed in that type ofrole."

“That's all I've known since being in this program is to hav
those guys lead the way, so this year was kind offun because we
got to show some new guys the ropes a little bit,"Bruns said.

Arseneault noted that even in what he called "a down year,‘
the Pioneers are still on pace to bring home the NCAA title in
several statistical categories.

“We still are poised to lead the country in scoring and.
three-point makes for the 15th time in 17 years and, in Dylan
seelman, have a first year on pace to lead the nation in three—
point makes per game," Arsenault wrote.

After 'an astonishing 131784 home victory over Knox an
a 95777 road loss to Illinois College, Grinnell hits the road t
rake on Knox yet again on Thursday. '

"Given our load record this season, there is no reason to ex
pect anything but a dogﬁght at Knox,"A.rseneault wrote before
the game. “We have been very erratic in our play this season
Hopefully, we will have learned our lessons from these game
and not let last week’s result versus Knox at home have artj
bentlng on the effort it will take to beat them at their place."

The Pioneers will not ﬁnish in the top four in the Mid-
west Conference and rhereforc are not playing in the Confer.-
enee Tournament. Grinnell will host Monmouth for their final
game on Saturday in an attempt to ﬁnish the season on u wins
ning note

“That's definitely what we‘re playing for, and as a team ifw
end the season [with a win] it would give everyone a positive
memory and sumeuiing to build on," Preston said.

Btuns also sees a‘foundarion that will 1Lll0W the Pioneers t
build a bright future. .

"I rhink there's a great core group that just really gets alon
with each other and they're going to have a lot of ﬁin tigurint
