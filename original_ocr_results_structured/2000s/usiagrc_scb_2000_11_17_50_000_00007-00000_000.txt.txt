bishop snitl the problem arose because
Harms. in the course orbible study, determined
for herselrthat the Bible did not approve orho.
moserunlity, since Harms’ own beliers were dif-
ferent, she was not holding completely true to
her own interpretation of scripture, and was
thererore violating her agreement to hold the
Bible as her ultimate authority.

it is unclear whether a student who believed
that the Bible did permit homosexuality would
have been allowed as an intervarsiiy leader,

on January 21, 1997, six leaders or
InterVarsity signed a letter to thenrresident
Pamela Ferguson detailing their position on ho.
mosexuality, “While we reeogmae that within
Christian churches there are a variety afopin-
ions concerning the Bible's teaching on home-
sexuality," the letter read, “as nn evangelical Chris.
tian group, we hold to n conservative interpreta—
tion ofRomans I as well as other passages in the
Bible which pronounce homosexual activity
immoral."

The letter continued, “we do not discrimi-
nate in our leadership selection on the basis of
scxuul orientation, but rather on the basis (7be-
lieh Rebecca Harms is notahomoscxuul. She
was asked to step down beause ore diirerence
in theological beliers. someone who is a homes
sexual, but agrees wid1 our interpretation orstiipt
ture, might well be invited to lead in our group."

According to Shotb. this represented a
change in the groups ointial position. “What
they were saying then was, a homosexual could
be a leader as long as they understood their stxue
ality as sinful and they were trying to change
[their sexuality],"shc said.

She added that group leaders were less than
cooperative in meetings with the Executive
Council. “intervaisity wouldn'tdinlogue. They
would only repeat the sentences that were their
standard response about homosexuality and the
authority or the Bible."

On February 28, 1997, after consultation
with the oollegos attorneys, Ferguson announced
that she would uphold ciady's decision to me
voke the group's omeial status. Intervarsity
would no longer be listed in admissions 11mm»

, Free Trade coffee

Bob’s begins to make the change to the organic brand that buys directly from growers

by Sarah Reinhard
Staff Writer

Genetically engineered foods and cloth
ing made in sweatshops have become issues
of widespread concern among college Stu»
dents. A similar problem, concerning farm»
ers who work for less than a living wage, is
also mnking its way to the rorerront.

Trey Reasonover '01, who is currently
pushing {or new coffee-buying policies on
campus, learned about “FairTratlc Coffee"
while interning at Oxfiim America. 2 Bos-
tonebased nonpront that seeks practical so.
lutions rot hunger and poverty worldwide.

The notice industry is an important place
to enact change, considering that coffee is
one of the most heavily traded commodi-
ties in the world, second only to oil, and
that it require: the labor of 20 million
people in nearly so Coun»
tries.

Transhair, an organi-
zation dedicated to climi-
nating uniust working
conditions among Latin
American coffee farmers.
buys eorree from small
family {aims at a fair
price then gives it the
“FairTradc” label.

"Farmers can't sci] the
coffee themselves," said
Reasonover. “They have
to send it through middlemtn."

Middlcmcn buy coffee from the farmers
at a price drastically below the actual value
ofthe harvest, than sell that coffee to com-
panies abroad for personal profit.

The independent farmers, lacking the
support or a union arrangement, have no
cholc: but to work through these middle»
men in order to sell their erop,

They earn on average less than 35 a day,
which is lass than what most Americans
(who dish out 518 billion a year for their
daily brew) spend on a Starbucks latte.

TransFair seeks to intercept the Farmers
before middlemen can and buy coffee at a
price that guarantees the farmers receive a
living wage for their work.

While farmers only rcceiye nn average of
about 5,33 per pound through middlemen,
Trnnshair guarantees at least $1.26 per
pound, nnd nlso assists rarnrets in forming

"The quality [of Fair Trade
coffee] is the same, and the
coffee is organically grown.
It's no more expensive than
other gourmet cot-fees."

working cooperatives.

Reasonovar came back to Grinnell anx»
ious to see the college supporting this grow»
ing cause. He reamed up with Bob's Undcrt
ground Manager Lauren Martin '02, and
Assistant MnnagerAdam Gtatch ‘01, to start
circulating Fair Trade corree at Bob's.

Gratch, who orders coffee from a toaster
he worked with in Madison, says they can
actually purchase Fair Trade products for a
cheaper price than the gourmet coffee usu»
ally sold at Boos.

“The quality is the some," said Starch
“and the coffee is organically grown. It’s no
more expenslve than other gourmet entrees."

Reasonover emphasized this advantage
as a basic cause ror enthusiasm about Fair
Trade. “Usually when people think orgzntcr
they think more expensive," he said. “In this
case, the prices and
product quality are
equal.”

What is import
tani, Reasonoversaid,
is to raise awareness
about and demand
ror Fair Trade prod.
utts in the United
states, in order to
provide the organieat
tion with means to
reaeh more (armors in
their errotts.

BecaustTransFair is runded through pri.
vate donations, they can only work with
about a very small percent of family torree
farmers. Informing people about the cigar
nization would increase funding. and
thereby give it more power to instigate
change.

“it‘s just simple eeonomies," said
Reasonover, “It’s all about treating dce
mands.“

Martin emphasized that Bob’s is in a
unique position to help Fair Trade.

“we have a secure market," she said,
“and a lot offreedom orwhat we can order,
which is unique For a college."

Mnrtin explained that she and starch
“make all the decisions" about what rood
gets sold in Bob's, and that the crif: begnn
entering to vegans and students interested
inorganic products about nine years ago.

Both plan to phase the new corree in

slowly The first couple pounds arrived last
week, and by next semester, “it should be
about hnltandhelr,” according to Gratch.

A few other cones companies, as well as
universities like Turts and Brown, have al-
ready begun using Fair Trade corree.
Starbucks, which also admitted Fair Trade
to be cheaper than other brands, has promt
ised a year—long trial with the product to see
ireustorners receive it well.

“in this case iris a matter orgetting that
money into the pocket orthe ramily farmer,"
said Starbucks senior vice president Dave
Olsen. "in out eoriee mission we challenge
ourselves to improve eorree qualiryand qual»
ity oiliie for the people growing it.“

Seattle's Best, which the rorum sells,
“pulled out or the agreement at the last
minute because. among other reasons, they
wanted to differentiate themselves from
Starbucks," said Reasonover, who hopes that
Fair Trade corree will eventually become
wellsknown enough to be less a cause of
competition between eorporetions than an
established standard.

Both Grateh and Reasonover are opri.
mistic about perceived Grinnellian responses
to Fair Trade. “we've been talking it up
among stair members," noted Gratch, who
hopes [a team up with Trey to “create eon.
sumcr awareness" on Campus.

lteasonover plans to work with
GRINI’AU and possibly the Sweatshop Coat
lition nert semester to further inform stu.
dents orliving wage and working issues.

“I think it would be cool if we got
Seattle’s Best and the Forum to switch over."
he said. “The dream in the future is that
everything could be Fair Trade,"

students interested in learning more
about Fair Trade corree are encouraged to
look at weosites ortwo nonproﬁt organizae
tions involved with the torree issue
(www.crfmrmerieeeeg and
www,rretirfeirwra.orgi, and to go order a
fresh.brewed cup at Bob’s.

Neither expects Fair Trade to encoun.
ter much adversity. Though Reasonover can
see middlemen potentially threatening
farmers by no longer buying from those
who’ve gone through FniiTtade, he doesn't
see an immediate threat,"Wc'rc just not at
that point yet," he snid,
