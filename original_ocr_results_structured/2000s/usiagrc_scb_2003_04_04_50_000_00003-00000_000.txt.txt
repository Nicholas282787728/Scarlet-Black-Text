Lockdown due In part to

hate-motivated incidents

Grinnell security chose to keep the school’s dorms
on 24—hour lockdown not only bemuso of federal law
relating to the current “orange level” rerror status, bur in
response to several specific incidents, some ofrhem ap.

Department.

side. Nothing was damaged.

security director sieve Briscoo said his decision over
break to place the dorms—and the college’s chemistry
storeroDm—on full iockdown was based on concern for
student safety in a relatively dsngerous time, Knowing
that the us. government has identified colleges as ”Suﬁ
targets" for terrorist atraclt, and rhat many Grinnell stu.
dents leave their doors unlocked, he decided rhat the ad»
ditional securitywas necessary to keep unwanted people
outofthe dorms,

According to assistant security director Russ Motta,
one of the stipulations of the orange alert is that colleges
are held liable for any damages thar occur to their stu.
deno as a rosulr of terrorist acts such as these incideno
seem to be.

Marta said that the polrtical atmosphere in the coun-
try was unlike anything he'd seen since he was in college
during the Vietnam War. The extraordinary situation, he
said, has led the security Department to take extraordi.

“We’ve never been here before," he said. “I’ve never
done this in my life.”

Briscoe said he has contacted die 1:131, the Depart
ment of Homeland security, and the AntirDefamation
Imgue about the telephone calls, which seemed to be
racially motivated. The security Department and the
Grinncll police department are investigating both Inci-
dents.

Satirical magazine draws
criticism

Members of the Student Organization of Latinas/
latrines (SOL) have formed a committee to discuss con»
tent in the Feb. 2003 issue of the GUM that some stu-
dents have found offensive. One article, entitled, “The
GUM Stefﬁ Multicultural Connections," featured an inc
terview of Latino GUM staff members Adam Portilla ‘03
andjohn Chavez ‘05. Another story, “Understanding Each
Other." listed srereorypes associated with various groups.

“Right now rirere are a variety ofopinions among the
membership,“ said SOL member Lola Garcia ’06, “That’s
why we've set up a committee rvithrn the group to get a
feel for the group's opinions and come to some kind of
consensus on 501: response, rfany.”

According to Giovanni Cortu ‘04, a discussion of
the GUM’s content has also been added to the .13ch of
today’s meeting of mmpus multicultural groups. which

will take place at noon in the lower level conference room
of the John crysral Center.

“1 found this edition of the GUM to be distasteful
and highly offensive," said Cotter, who is not affiliated
with 501. “Moreover, 1 would have to say that events
like these go to show that there are Grinnellians who don't
understand the dynamics of racism and privilegc."

According to GUM editor Sarah Aswell ‘03, “The
article in question was intended to be a satire about ste.
reoryping."

The GUM staffhoped “to convey how useless stereo,
type and essentialist views ofrace, gender, religion. setue
ality, and dass are," Aswell said,

“1 do regret that others did not see the article in the
sarrre light, and 1 do respect meir thoughts and feelings
on the subjoct," Aswell said “1 urge everyone to speak
out on the subicclt” The GUM staff plans to hold an
open forum ricxt week to invite student discussion.

SOL is also concerned with facilitating dialogue be»
tween the two groups, Garcia said, “We are talking to
GUM people and right now trying to keep the lines of
communication open between the GUM, SOL, and ad
miiiistrdtors,” she said

1f the events of Septemher 11 may
have piqued Grinnellrans interest in ere
ploring the world outside the United
States, the events that have followed may
have dampened it,

The off-campus study Board re»
cently approved 188 students’ proposals
to study offecampus during the 2003.
2004 academic year. This marks a signiﬁ-
cant drop from last year, when the hoard
approved 251 stu-
dents, and a small
drop from the were
age of beiween 205
and 215 in previous
years. said Director
of off.campus
study Richard
bright.

Why the drop
from last ycar? “Last
year’s larger appli-
cant numbet can be
parrly explained by
the fact that the
sophomore class was
bigger," said Bright,
“but it also seems to
have been part ofa
larger phenomenon, since higher nume
hcrs were also reported at several other
colleges.

“Some think that the Initial effect of
September 1 i was, unetpecredly, a greater
interest in studying oficampus," he said.
“Perhaps September 11 had the effect of
underscoring the importance of gaining
a better understanding ofthe world and
led to more studeno applying.”

The current international situation
may be having the opposite effect, Bright
said. He noted that the number of ap
plications for study abroad were down or
colleges and universities across the Couli-
try,

”When it became clear that a war in
lrrq would probably happen, 1 think
nrore people started perceiving the world
as a nruch less stable place, and some just
feel safer staying at home," Bright said.

The number ofsrudenrs planning to

similar to thenum.
bers in previous

This year, only 17

This shift, cxplainchnnc ceissinger,
the administrator who oversees GIL and
GIW, is probably due less to political
evcirrs than to rhevirrucs ofthc new City
and GIL spring programs, which focus
on internships rather than classroom
study

lm not surprised that the GIL spring
and GIW programs are popular.

ties provide real work expcrmncc and can
be very formative for students when it

Federal government
could View ILL

patron records

by Leslie Boyadjian
Staff Writer

Studcnc borrowing boolc from other colleges' llbmr»
iris could find records of their requests subieer to federal
scrutiny. according to Grrnnells librarians,

The US. government’s efforts to prevent future terror-
ism have taken many forms. One is the Uniting and
strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools
Required to intercept and Obstrucherrorism Acrofzom
or the USA PATRIOT Act. The act seeks to “atpand law
enforcemenr's surveillance and investigative powers," inc
eluding the power to investigate patrons' records and come
purer usage.

Grinncll faculty librarian Gail Bonath said the act al-
lows officials to “seire . .. records without specifically idcn-
rtfying what they're looking for."

The American LibraryAssooiarion (ALA) has cxprcscd
concerns about the act, saying that such oversight violates
patrons' privacy and undermines citioens’ constitutional
rights and the free ﬂow of information that libraries are
designed to provide

The ALA has established procedural guidelines for li-
brarians to follow if approached by a law enforcement of
ficial and presented with a subpoena Burling Library fac»
ulry received training forsuch an instance in a teleconfer.
enoe last December,

If presented with a subpoena, librarians are instructed
to contact asupervisor who in mm is instnicrcd to contact
a lawyer. Grinncll College librarians are instructed to con-
tact the college attorney if presented with a warrant, lie
brarians are instructed not to interfere, but to contact a
supervisor nonetheless as soon as possible.

Are records being held ofall ofthe books that students
have checked out, just waiting for some government offic
cial to thumb through? No, According to Bonath, library
records are held onto only as long as materials are checked
out. When a book from hurling is returned, the patrons
account is cleared. This has been library policy since 1989
when the library switched from a card system to a com.
puterized system in the interest of patron prrvacy,

Records including materials checked out through the
inter—library loan (ILL) system are another story, however.
Copyright laws require that lit records be retained for
one year lfa library is too frequently requesting a oeriain
publication, the reasoning goes, it may become necessary
that rhar library subscribe to or purchase that item rather
than repeatedly borrowing it. As a result, ILL records will
be available for federal investigation,

Government officials will not be allowed to peruse
records immediately upon presenting a subpoena Librar—
ians will talk to the college's lawyers first.

“We would want somebody else to look at it,” said
Bonath, “before we just handed that information over."

But Jonathan Brand, vice president for institutional
and budget planning, said that he or other legal counsel
for the college wouldn’t be able to do more than look, as
long as the papers were in order.

“Under civil or criminal penalty. we are bound to one
swer lawful subpoenas,” he said,

The library has reviewed its policies on this mattersince
the teleconference, using the recommendations oftheALA
and the policies of other libraries as models. These policies
can be viewed on the Grinnell Collcgc Library website,
