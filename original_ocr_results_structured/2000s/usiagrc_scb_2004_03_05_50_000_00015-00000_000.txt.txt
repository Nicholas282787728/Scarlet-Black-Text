“we played hard." said Choquettc.
“Some things happened this season that
were loeyond our control. Who knows
where we would have been tfwe had been
hmlthy the whole season, Early on in the
year when we had all our guys hmlrhy and

able."

Grinnell opened (lit: year 134) but hit
a brutal Stretch ot road gsmes late in the
