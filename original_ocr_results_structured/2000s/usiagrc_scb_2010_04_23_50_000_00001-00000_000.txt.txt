Raynard Kington
visits campus,
talks 2010-2011

BY DARWIN MANNING
President-to-be Raynard Kington,
made his much anticipated second visit to
campus this past sunday and Monday. He
spoke to students in the JRC 101 at 7 p.m,
on Sunday. then to staff at 9:30 am on

Monday and finally faculty at 2 pm, with

ofwhich were in the South Lounge,

All three meetings were meant to be
(LISLA sessions, in which the Grinnell Com-
munity could gain a better understanding
of who Kington was and what his plans
were for the College.

Kington’s last time on campus was Feb,
24, when Chair of the Board of the Trust-
ees David White '90 announced his presi-
dency to a packed Herrick Chapel. He was
received to much tanrare and made appears
ances across campus throughout the day,

However, as the current Deputy Dir
rector at the National Institute of Health
(NIH), Kingron's stay was necessarily short.

tied to

work at
the NIH, his contact with campus has been
limited,

The session with students felt informal
as charts were arranged in a grant circle,
with Kington sitting at one of them, pure
ting him on a level playing ﬁeld with the
rest of the students. Meanwhile, the other
two sessions adapted a far more formal feel
with him standing at a podium and the au-
dience in rows.

Along the lines of the relationship be
tween students. faculty and staff, the issue
of a lack of transparency was raised in all
three QM sessionsr

“All three groups asked to be more trans-
parently integrated into the process for the
development or policies and for making
decisions in the administration of the Col»
lege,“ Kington said. “All three groups also
asked for better communication about how
decisions are made and the rationale for {1’
nal decisions”

Sociology Professor Ke-
sho Scott asked Kington
how he thought his experi-
ence as a black man and an
administrator who must res
solve policy issues Will allow
him to produce an environ
ment of civility and respect
for others,

Kington responded by
discussing how if you don’t
give everyone the same chance then you
will lose out on a lot of valuable minds, and
thus it should be a college's goal to accept
students needrhlind,

“Dr. Kingtou answered my question by
pointing out that he will draw on his mul-
tiple experiences, ‘As always being an out
sidei,’... to make the kinds ofdecisions that
will help us do ouriob better and push the

mission of the College forward," Scott said.
“I thought it was informative and hon-
est and drawn from his philosophical and
operational goals approach to the kind of
leadership he
intends for the
College.”

about how he
viewed schol—

grams such as
Posse, which
provides full scholarships to several dozen
students on campus, and whether he would
try to promote these even more as Presi-
dent.

“The fact that he spoke about how it’s
a waste that all those minds aren't going to
college, he showcd a very positive attitude
towards it," A .ll\\l)Lllr\ , id. “I feel that 1-

showed that he’s really thought a lot about
bringing in a more diverse background of
students when he is President."

At the student session, Aurora leinn’
Elmore ‘12 started the forum by asking
about Kington's research regarding college
drinking and how that would play out in
his new role as president.

He stressed that the goal or his past
work on issues or alcohol consumption was
not to ban drinking from college campuses
altogether, but rather find a healthy bale
anee. “Selagovernance has been distinctive
part of experience here," ngron said in
the student QM, adding that he would al-
low that policy to shape attitudes towards
alcohol on campus.

Finally, the President stressed how cns
thusiastic he was about looking ahead to
August and how impressed he is already
with Grinnell, “What artracrcd me to this
institution, was one its strong academic
quality, but two its social consciousness and
its commitment to make this woild butter "

Block Party to
host more Johns

BYEMILYBAJET .

Block Party is bringing more than just a
beer truck to High Street. In an eﬂ’ort to reduce
public indecency port-a—johns will be added to
Block Party this year Block Party coordinators,
the Harm Reduction Committee and Grinnell
Police Department ho that the rt-a-johrisY
presence at the party PCwill discourage studmts
from urinating in public.

“We’ve seen them urinating near the
train tracks, which is not only against the law
and ayinst federal law for being on the train
tracks unauthorized, but it's also a dangerous
situation,” said Gtinnell Chief of Feline Jody
Matherly“So this yearwe recommended port-
a—johnr.“ .

Although public urination is typically come
man during Block Party, as it takes place on?
doors from the late morning to the early after-
noon on the last day ofﬁnals, the rainy weather
lastycm’ led to a much larger number of students
partaking in the practice. High Street home
owners seeking to keep muddy footed individtr
315 from using their bathrooms caused students
to ﬁnd their urination stations elsewhere, which
usually meant outside and in public.

“Our house was cotered, literally, in mud
last year after Block Party and didn’t recover for
some time,” said two time High Street resident
and Block Party coordinator Chad Christoff
'10. “It was deﬁnitely an inconvenience for us,
but we were not about to let rhe weather spoil
Block Party"

Besides the mind, he port johns will
hopefully limit damaged or stolen property
on High Street, which has been a problem in
past years. Additionally, wristbands will also be
distributed to eryearrolds in compliance with
the law, a rule last year’s coordinators forgot to
enact.

"Wristbands have been a protocol for the
College every year, and last year they forgot
about them [and] we made sure that it‘s go,
ing to be taken care orthis year," Matherly said.
‘We could certainly take action and ID people
ifwe thoughtwe needed to but by and large the
coordinators of that event have acted responsi-
bly [and] we allow them to take that taskon.”

By ensuring that those only 21 and older
sport the wristbands this year, the unspoken
trusting relationship between the Grinnell p0,
lice Department and the Grinnell studentbody
will continue. This healthy relationship ensures
the continuation of Grinnell timerhonoted tia-
dieions, such as Block Party. _

“The police want everybody to have a good
time, Lheyjust don't want anybody to do any
thing stupid or cause any d'mxactions that take
away from the party," Christoffsaid. "They will
arrest people for urinating anywhere in the
block, and people who leave die block with an
open container will deﬁnitely be on grounds to
be attested."

Matherly hopes the Block Party tradition
can continue and that students remember not
to leave the parameter with drinks, or to urinate
in public.

"l'vc been here seven years and I've support-
ed it everyyeat,"Mmherly sai ‘Do what you’re
supposed to throughout the year. treat out of
ﬂoors right, and, if you are arrested, be nice, and
by and large it's a great relationship. I think it's
a good thing ﬁx the students. a good thing tor
the city, good thing for the College. As long as
they're doing it responsibly and legally they’ll
always have my support."
