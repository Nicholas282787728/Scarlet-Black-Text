Despite the strain of the Depression and World War II,
Grinnell had a thriving dating scene in the 19405

Dating at Grinncll in the 19405 meant actually
going out on dates with a boy or girl. “Dating was
the big thing for us," said Audrey Howard Swanson
‘44, "Students had dates or went steady, which was a
popular way to go We didn't go so much in groups,
as the kids do today"

Hot spots 0 mplrs included the original
Strand Theatremnd r tatlrllllts like Candy/land and
rhe White Spot. According to George McIntosh
‘45, though, "social life cenleled on the campus,"
with activities such as organized dances, hayrides,
picnics, Homecoming festivities, bridge games and
dormirory open houses.

“Dorm life was fun: tlc,"sald Lucia Taylor ‘44.

“The rich man and rhc poor
man both walked," Charles Mac
Murray ‘49 said.

"We had come out om years
otDopr-ession, said swanson, so
we were used to everyone being
equal and no one having very much in the way of
material things"

The cultule of tlatmg also floulisherl because
all housing was gendetcseglegated, with women’s
dorrns on South Campus men: on North and Slh
Ave. acting as a campus wide Clmstir} belt.

said Taylor, “but whoever invired him would have
been cxpellcd."Bccr\usc ofthese rcstricrions, strong,
unique hall cultures formed. Each hall had their
own page in the Cyclone annual, listing off exploits
of their residents as well as hall jokes. “We had ll
ﬁerce hall loyalty,"said Taylor, a proud Haines Hall
Heller.

Reﬂecting the moral standards of the time,
women's dorms “had all kinds of terribly resn lttlvc
rules,"Taylor said. In rrue Grinnell spirit, she went
on to say, "we challenged every rule char the college
had, and we man god to lircak most ol'lhem."

one dcmlty not proscribed, however, was
smoking. “In rhose (lays, everybody smoked, but
not in your room," Taylor said “You were ﬁned
