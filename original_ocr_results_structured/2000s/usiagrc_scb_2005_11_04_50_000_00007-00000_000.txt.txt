How It Is

Often students are oblivious to problems within the
house or apartment they plan to rent and only discover
them after they have begun to live in the house. Unsusr
pecting students can fall prey to rusty water pipes, water
stains, signs of insects and exposed electrical wiring.
Students can get more information on aspects of their
temporary home at the website of the American Society
or Home Inspectors, www.ﬂrhi.org.

AllisonTobey’07and her roommate Rachel Walman
’06, who live on the ﬁrst ﬂoor of the Brande, found that
the state of the house often depends as much on the
previous occupants as it does on the landlord. When
they moved in to their apartment, the place was cock-
roach—infested.

Walman said that the family that had lived in the
apartment for seven years before them was probably
responsible for the unwelcome guests.

Their landlord, Latcham, said, “Very seldom have I
heard anything Like that] think sometimes [the tenants]
bring them in with them."

Walnian said that Latcham took
care of the bug problem by boarding
up a wall and have since not had any
trouble with the roaches.

Many Gtinnell landlords often do
not respond to complaints because they
know that students will be gone within
two years.“'Ihe landlords won’t do any-
thing unless they have to,"Walman sa
“Unless you get a speciﬁc complaint,

they're hard to pin down."

As the inhabitants of933 High Street Jessica Peltan
'06, Nicole Bungert '06 and Lauren Page ‘06 found,
sometimes a dump is a dump.

As it turns out, the house has serious plumbing
issues. Water drips down the wall day and night from

the chimney. The housemates remedied the situation by
painting the wall green, which hid the
water stains.

Their landlord, while not insisting that they pay the full

bill, had not repaired either the mll or

the shower at the time of interview.

What to
watch for

. High ceilings and big
rooms ralre lots oi
energy to heat in the
winter, so be wary of
pricey utilities: il you

are looking at a house,
efficient furnaces and in-
sulation in the attic can
make a big difference

. aucecs shouldn't
drip: also. water stains
on ceilings or noors
often indicate previous
plumbing problems that
might not have been
addressed.

-When it comes to
visible damage. such as
rusted pipes or rotten
woodworkalmys re-
member that what you
see is only the beginning
oi what you gse it is
likely that there is much
more damage behind
the walls or under the
floors.

- Check for scorched
wires in electrical boxes,
3 sure sign of damage
and a potential ﬁre hax—
nrd.Also, ask about. the
wiring: in the off chance
thata house has alumi-
num wiring. that poses a
ﬁre danger roo.

- Cockroaches scurrying
about! Mouse traps in
the cellar? You might

have to decide how
comlortahle you are

with a few more room- '
mates.

'The house or apart»
merit should have spaces
that suit your individual
needs. If you like to
cook. make sure there

is plenty of counter
space and that the oven
and stove work wellflr
you plan to have parties
make sure the living
room and porch are big
enough.
