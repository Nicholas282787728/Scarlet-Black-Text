Bv RACHEL FIELDS

I'd consider myself sex-positive l have
discussed the clitoris, said “penis" on occasion
without giggling and contemplated, for long
seconds, enrolling in Human Sexuality. But, in
real life, far away from the Grinnell Female-
Only Masturbation Workshop Bubble, talking
about sex can make me extremely uncomfortr
able. The possibility of havrng to make small
talk with a middle-aged male store clerk while
he rings up my vibrator isn’t exactly pleasur-
able. There comes a time, though, when we
all have to put these fears aside. That is how,
boyfriend in tow,I set out on 1420 to make my
first visit to Iowa’s most prominent sex shop:
the Lion’s Den.

we pulled onto the highway at 11:30 pm,
an eerie time reserved for overrcommitted colt
lege students and tired truckers] love Grinnell,
but leaving is exhilarating - merging with the
rest ofworld in pursuit of somewhere farther
than the Grille, Fog settled over the highway,
and I wanted to ask Jon if we’d actually m.
aged to get lost on 1-80. Highway Iowa isn’t
exactly chock-full of landmarks, and at night,
it feels so empty that you almost forget where
you are.

But all too soon, the Lions Den loomed
yellow and red on the hoiizon. I needn’t have
worried thatrwe’d miss the SIDp', places Like
this have to be wellrlit, tempting people who
have been driving for 14 hours. The exit sign
indicates a town, but it must be miles away.
Another helpful sign stands just beyond the
parking lot of sinners: “Jesusl The Adult su-
per Savior!” But the sex store itself doesn’t look
controversial rs all I can see from the highway
is its forryrfoot billboard and an unassuming
shack on the side of the road. Looking for all
the world like an abandoned Pizza I'IHI in an
empty parking lot, the place is actually a little
sad.

As we parked the car besrde several picks
up t‘riicks, I admitted that I‘d never actually
been to a place like this before. I had an ime
age ofa dark, smoky room with glowing dildos
on the walls, rncn stepping out from behind
beaded curtains looking pleastlred. The lobby
of the store was appropriately odd. The wall
sported a map of the country showing all the
Lions Den locations in the cotrutry (this is, ape
parently, the only one in Iowa). and a vending
machine sold lots ofGatorade and one plastic»
wrapped hamburger.

I took a deep breath, braced myself, and
pushed open the door into the store. To my
surprise, the store was brightlyrlit and colorful;
if not for the cornucopia of porn and vibrators,
it could have been the inside of a Blockbuster.
Valentine’s Day decoratrons hung from the
ceiling, and l imagined presenting a significant
other with a faux vagina or a bondage chair.
Not this year, I don't think.

Aftei a brief, awkward ens
counter with the gruff, middle-
aged man on dury,we wander-ed
around the store for a while. I
don’t think of myselfas extremes
ly immature, but it‘s haid not to
unleash my inner thirteen-year-
old boywhcn faced with an aisle
of animalrthemed vibrators. I
wanted to take a picture with a
dildo about the size ofmy entiic

torso,but the employee had already told us
that photography was forbidden, Smelling the
different varieties of flavored lube, luckily, was
arokay. I tried to remember the waiiiiiig advice
Jens mother gave us when we informed her
(under some duress) of our upcoming advent
ture: "Don’t touch anything "This turns out to
be a' very difﬁcult urge to quell when one rs
presented with a “realistic fake vagrna."l will
vouch that it feels nothing like the ieal thing.

Aeurttc tot a CHEAP,
EASV ADVENTURE?

We perused the “bath products" for a while,
debating as to whether the warming lube
would actually be extremely painful. If there‘s
one thing I really don't want to do whrle hav-
ing sex, it’s feel like I’m on fire. There was a
box of Kleenex and some toothpicks at the end
of the shelf, and after a few minutes ofconfu
sionJon asked the employee what the (OOKlr
picks were for. Apparently, they help to test the
lube on your skin so that your hands “don’t get
all sticky.”

Eventually, we decided to spring for a pair
of huge, inﬂatable crotic dice and a Neverr
HaverIrEverresque car-d garneThe packaging
advertised the dice as being for “pool play”,
but I have trouble imaging a situation where
I’d be swimming and want someone to eroti-
cally “massage ear". After realizing that I didn't
have any money and that Jon would have to
make my illicit purchase on his credit card, we
thanked the man and left. I blew
up the dice in the lobby outside
the store, and we laughed so hard
that the man came out and asked
us if we needed any help. Leave it
to me to make uncomfortable sex-
stote-visit experiences even more
awkward

1n the car on the way home,
I realized that my two purchases
were somewhat problematic. In
the frrst place, most of the words
on the two erotic dicc don't go together at all
(“Rub lips"? And why is there no side that has
any kind ofgenitalia?). Secondly, the questions
in the Never-Have-I-Ever card game were a
little disturbing. After “Have you cvcr tasted a
turd?" and “Have you ever sniffed an animal’s
butt?",Jon and I decided to put the game on
the back burner and just talk the rest of the
way home.
