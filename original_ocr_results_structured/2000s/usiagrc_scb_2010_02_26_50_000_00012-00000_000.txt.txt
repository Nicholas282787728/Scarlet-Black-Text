Staff turnover troubling

Next year, Dr. Raynard Kingwn won‘t be the only new face
on campus. With the de atture of Residence Life Coordlnr
tors (RLC) Eric Voss a Katie Lau, Student Affairs will be
hiring three new RLCs.

Hiring halfa new stalffor the sition ofRLC is not ob
aerly a new endeavor for Student airs. In recent years, irl~
dividuals hired into this position have stayed on campus for a
maximum ofrwo years, for a variety ofdifferent reasons. Seeing
as the projected dose for a student to graduate from Grinndl
College is four years, it is an alarming wake-up call to Student
Aifairs that every senior at this college has been at the college
[or longer than an RLC has. Furrhcnnore, the class of 2010 has
been here longer than the grand majority of Student Affairs
Administrators. Granted, the College's determined shelflife for
an RLC is a (preferred) maximum ofthree years.

But why three years? ifa student lives in the residence halls
for the duration of their Grinnell College career, they will, at
minimum, have two different RLCs. At the rate ofrecenr Stu—
dent Affairs turnover, it is likely that a student will have a new
RLC every single year rhey remain in the residence halls. How
does this beneﬁt students?

If the preferred maximum tenure of an RLC was increased
to five years, an’RLc could logistically actually maintain a
relationship with a student for the entirety of the student’s
Grinnell carecrrArld isn’t that kind ofthe point ofan RLC—lo
form a bond with students in their residence hall, something
that might not happen to its fullest potential in a single year?
The brief description ofeche RLC position, as shown on the
Grinnell College website, is, “All of the Residence Life Coot-
dluators are Masters level professionals who have training in
worldng widi you, listening to you and helping you gain com-
fort with your academic workload and other eooccnis you may
have."This might not be exactly how a student would describe
the position of RLC, but regardless, RLCs would be able to
orcsl at these three facets ofthe job description iftheywete able
to stay ar the college longer.

But then again, these are young individuals with mastms
degrees. Why would they mm to stay in Grinnell for three
years, let alone four orrnorei A main problem lies in the fact
that, at Grinnell, from the position of RLC there is no room

The B8c§ summarized the administration in one headline,
“Some Idiot Accidentally Fires Kim HindseBrush." Later in
the article, they made the point that the class of2011 will have
more experience at Grinnell than any ofthe RLCs on campus.
A week later, I heard that the administration ﬁred Associate
Dean of Admissions MarleneJacks.

I remember being a senior in high school and five mine
utes after being accepted into my dream school, MarleneJacks
called me and [Old me to visit GrinnellThe energy and care

ed the energy that the school puts into its students. Marlene
stayed in touch with me throughout my four years at Grinnell
and still asks about my mother. This is the kind of attention
that Marlene paid to her students.

I am shocked and disgusted with the administration in
ﬁnding her no longer an asset to the institution. Marlene Jacks
is more than an asset, she is a staple. Nowhere in her job de-

At least not anymore. Kim Hindszrush, the campus~beloved
RLC who exceeded the three year maximum for a fourth year,
stayed on campus this year in a new position, Associate Direc—
tor of Residence Life 23: Orientau'on, one which the College re»
cently terminated. Before the creation of the Associate Director
of Residence Life 8c Orientation, with the departure of Sheree
Andrews, there was student conjecture that HindsrBrush should
occupy Andrews' old posidcn,Thls notion was largely a result of
the fact that Hinds-Brush is a valuable student resource. and.
like Andrews, is someone that students feel comfortable with.

However, no such move was even considered, as Hinds—
Brush was determined to not have sufficient credentials for
the position. Such a move in Student Alﬁirs Was not
almys so rcadily dismissed—-former Vice President
of Student Services, Tom Crady began his Grinnell
career as an RLC and moved upwards through the
Student Aﬁairs ladder. Two years ago, Crady was
hired to the position of Dean of Students at Darts
mouth University.

Let's ger honest llerhsmdems would beneﬁt if
RLCs were on campus longer. lfour shining personalities
and Iowa's temperate climate alen’t winning them over, there has
to be some kind of incentive to not only draw an RLC to the
College, but to keep them here.

More communication
would be constructive

The 5&5 hears its fair share of nasty minors that have to be
chased down only to discover that somebody cried wolf and got
everyone riled up. Occasionally however, these rumors that we
think are ridiculous somehow actually become reality.

We thought that Cleveland ms just being paranoid when
we heard that Facilities Management was building a door to
the Computer lab so that some authoritarian entity could lock
the lounge at night. “They" want to crack dovm on smoking
and partying and everything that makes college fun—or at least
that’s the way the rumor goes. , '

Demite our doubt,we looked into it, and that story is on the
from page. But as we learned more and more about the installa-
tion ofthe door, we began to doubt: the complaints less and less

Her ﬁring forces me to question the administration’s intenr
tions. What did Marlene lack that other recruiters had? Are
there too many minorities at rhis school? Are we simply re-
placing one AfricanrAmeritan staff member for another? ls
minority presence too much and too fast? Marlene Jacks has ll

Is the administration afraid ofexperience? I’m disappointed in
the school's decisions, and as Charisma said, “There are some

and that’s what most disgusts me about this situation.

First off, construction started without so much as an email
to students. The email from RLC Eric Vos was a day late and
rather uninformative. It gave no explanation, no end date,just
an announcement that construction had started, which was a
moot point. We understand that there was a communication
problem between Vos and FM but frankly, the lack of concern
about communication is an ongoing problem that this space
discusses way more than it should. We hope that Cleveland
will accept the apology from FM, but an apology is only sin~
core when there is action to prevent the event from happening
again. We hope that FM could take a page out of Security Di—
rector Steve Briscoe’s book and send out the emails themselves.
Two weeks ago, we used this

> space to advocate under—
standing concerning the

Cleveland patrols be-

cause smoking is against

the law and trying to re-
strict onvcampus smok-
ing is within the College’s
prerogative. However, we
think that locking the lounge is
extreme [or two reasons. Firstly, it’s unproductive. The admin-
lstrallon should know through their previous experience with
Cleveland that restricting the area in which people can smoke
does nothing to restrict rhe act ol’slnoking. People have legsi
they will walk somewhcrc else and enjoy a cigarette.

On a deeper level, the act of locking the lounge assumes a
relationship between students and administration that should
no: existThere was never any student input in this project, de
spite it direcdy affecting their living arrangements. Addition—
ally, the communication problems mentioned above regarding
the construction reveal a lack of concern for student opinion.
The panels by security—which have worked—operate on
system of trust that preserves student autonomy, locking the
lounge does not.

The solution is clear to us and we have already made steps
towards it, Andrea Conner should go on record saying that
they will never, ever lock the lounge. Conner already said that
they do nor plan on locking the lounge because the patrols
seem to beworking. But a promise that the lounge would never
be locked would show that Reslifc is sincere in their apology

It’s easy to recycle at Grinnell — each hall has its own recye
cling room, not to mention those in the Grill and other bulld’
ings. Here at Grinnell, we recycle Redeemables, Clear Glass,
Plastics numbered 1*7, Tin and Aluminum, Newsprint,
Glossy Paper, Cardboard, and Mixed Paper. There is even a
bin in the rnailroom in which you can recycle batteries, and
ifyou have your own printer, you can place your used print
cartridges in a box or envelope, address them so “Chris Bait,"
and drop them in the intraeeampus mail slot in rhe mailroom.
Be careful with what you recycle; if you put something wrong
in a recycling bin, everything in the bin will go into the trash,
and no one wants that!"
