Baseball struggles with slump

BY ABBY RAPOPORT

Every sports team struggles to overcome tough
losses, but some defeats are easier to accept than oth-
ers. Unfortunately for the baseball team,last Monday’s
match against Simpson was not one of these games,
The Pioneers fell to the Storm 27s6 during their first
home game of the season on Monday, April 3. The
defeat was a hard blow for a team that had concen-
tmtod on keeping all orirs gimcs close.

Thc 21 point loss was a wakcup call for some of
the Pioneers

“We realized we had to do something," said pitch-
er Michael Rosenbaum ’08.

The baseball ream won two ofrhc five games after
the loss to Simpson. but all of the losses were within
a twirpoint range. The improvement came after the
team began to emphasize offense.

Both Rosenbaum and CJ. Chamberlain ’08 bee
licvc that timcly hirring combined with stringing hits
together win turn the team’s close losses into wins.

The Pioneers Cllme out of spring break with a 5-4
record, one of the best records for the team in sev-
eral years. However, -thc baseball team has had trouble
winning since returning to Grinncll.

“Our defense keeps things close," said Chambers
lain, “We need to finish them off through the last
inning."

Afrcr Monday's loss, the team played two backs
tarback doubleheaders on Saturday and Sunday.
The Pioneers won their ﬁrst game against Knox on
Saturday but then dropped the next Contest against
the Prairie Fire, The baseball team also lost its two
matches against Coo the next day as well.

The Pioneers pulled out or rheir slump last
Wednesday with a 473 win on the road against Wils
liam Penn University

The team has tried to incorporate numeious
freshmen into its roster in order to build conﬁdence
and hclp bring rhc team rogcrhcr.

“We have a pretty deep team," Stud Chamberlain.
“At evcly position there are a few people who could
play it well."

But even so, the rcam cannor seem ro pull our wins
in tight games.

Rosenpiurn believes the Simpson game was an
anomaly. “Their liming was contagious all day," he
said, noting that as the hitting continued, it became
harder and harder to maintain defense,

But as rhc season progresses, the ability to win
close games is beginning to become a major factor as
the Midwest Conference looms ahead.

Losses like the Simpson game increase the pres-
sure which hurts rlic team's ability to play well.

Sports Brief:

“To win we [shouldn’t] be thinking as much,” said
Rosenbnum, “enjoying [the game] instead orrccling
pressure, loosening up and just having fun,"

“We just need to bring the team together and .
that'll help us win all these close games were losing,”
said James Bird 07.

No matter whar rhc strategy is, rhc players hope
that their season will improve.

“we just haven’t had things go our way," said
Cliamhcrliin. ”It'll just build oncc wc gcr the winning
streak on."

Thc Grinncll men's golf icam gor off in a rough
start it the VViIrtlmrg invitational last Friday but fine
ished on a high note on Saturday, beating out Car—
lcton College and rho University of Dubuqu: to rin-
ish' in 16‘" place The (com finished with 3 two round
total score of 659.

Fridays round was played at Centennial Oaks
coir Course in Waverly, lowa, and Saturday's round
was held at ancrly Golfand Collntry Club.

Michnel lnman '09 was Grinnell's low scorer,
carding i two-round total of163 and finishing in a
no for 59" place overall Ryan Long ’08 tied for 74m
placc with a score of168,Wcs Barber '06 finished in
76'h with a 169 and Benjohilnnsen'Oé finished in 81“
with a score of 172.

Saturday's round was considerably hcrrcr for the
Pioneers Every golfer lowered their score and four of
the Pioneers carded scores in the 70s.

“The first day of the competition wits i hit disups
pointing for a few of us,” said Johinnscn. “The reim
plnycd wcll on tho second day, though. We counted
four scores in the 70s, which we have only done out:
orhcr time in the four ycilrs 1 have played."

All the Grinnell golfers had to battle the elements
at ertburg, as the wind and cold temperatures mndc
for some prcrry drrricirlr playing conditions.

“The weather was less than ideal on both days of
the competition,” slud lohannscn. “On the first day
the Wind blew hnrdcl than I can remember ever play—
ing in before and rhc second day smrrcd out cold.”

The Pioneers improved rhcir pcrrnrmincc during
the week placing 13‘" nr the Simpson invirnrionul on
Tuesday.

Head Coach Greg Wallace and the Pioneers
will be hoping for better wcarhcr for the upcoming
Monmollth Invitational this Saturday at the Gibson
Woods Monmouth GolfCourse.

Wallace will begin to select his top golfers for the
conference matches by evaluating their performances
in the upcoming practices and competitions.

“We need to develop our number five and six
positions as much as possible," said Wallace. “Tl-lose
scores become very important in the team standings.
We have five or six players that will battle it out for
those two spots over the next two weeks,"

During the short golf season, it is important for
the team to get on track early and remain focused. .

This is especially true In the Midwest Conference,
where the tight competition forccs rooms to lock in
early and stay consistent in order to remain competis
tivc.

The Pioneers will have to rind rlicir groove soon
with rlic ch championships rapidly approaching

"We hitvc a very short season, said Johannsen.
‘Aftci this weekend, the only competitions we have
left are (lit: Southern Division competition nnd coli-
forcncc."

“We need to work on our short grime, the shots
around the greens to save strokes, said VVallricc. It is
imperative for us to drive the brill better off. the tee
wc will spcnd n good imonnr orrimc on work .ironnd
rlic greens, bur focris‘on competition as much is poe
Sible.”

“The conference tournimcm will hi: i thrcedny
event for the fiist time," said Johannsen. “We have to
mnkc sure we don't shoot ourselves our orrlic Camper
ririon with one big number,"
