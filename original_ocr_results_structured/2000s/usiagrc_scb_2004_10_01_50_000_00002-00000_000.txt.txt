KDIC begins broadcast-
ing Monday

Two weeks ago it lookcd like it would be
months before Gtinncll College’s radio star
tion, KDIC, went back on the air. However,
after getting a Special Temporary Authority
from the Federal Communications Commis-
sion (FCC), KDIC will go back on the air-
waves at 88.5 FM next Monday morning.

After moving their antenna, KDIC needed
approval from the FCC for broadcasting, ripr
prorai which can take many months.

However, after Huntcl, the cngrncerrng
company contracted by Shocn to do the pa—
perworlt tor the antenna, managed to get in
contact With an actual pCrson from the FCC,
they were able to gct papCrwork sent and ap
proved in less than 72 hours, according to srms.
“Everything just fell into place," said Michael
Sims, Associatc Dean for Student Life.

Huntcl's contact got KDIC a Special
Temporary Authority from FCC to continue
hroadcasting. This temporary license will sup.
port the station until the ofﬁcial paperwotkior
the antenna move is processed, which could
take as long as four months.

The original paperwork for the new an-
tenna location, which was lost, has now been
rcsubm'tttcd,and this process as well as the star
tion broadcasting license renewal processes are
hoth on track and moving along, according to
Sims. The station is expected to have its pCr-
manent broadcasting license renewed by the
time it is supposed to run out in February.

SGA VP considers leave
of absence

On Monday, SGA Senators rcccivcd an
email from Mike Maloncy ’06, SGA admin-
istrative coordinator, reporting that SGA Vice
P , ent Andy Grimm ’05 was talcingnlcavc
of absence this semester. However, around
noon on Tuesday, Grimm decided to stay.

Grimm dismissed the possibility ottrrltrng
in emcrgcncy niedrcrtl leave tor the rust otthe
school year With thc SGA Cabinet and Slu-
dent At r iis. lle cons lercd taking a leave of
absence due to high le otsrrcss and depresr
sron, he said,

Grimm said lllal too otten he was ignoring
othcr aspects of his lrtc, especially endemic
responsibilities, because of his substantial at-
[Cnuon to SGA. “I’m going to have to work
to ﬁnd a balance between this and class and
time [01 myself," he s d. I’m a little bit too
dCCliCath to thisjoh at t mes."

However, Grimm also cited SGA as a
major factor in his ﬁnal d1: sion not to take
a leave of absence. “I love this job. I love the
Cahinet," he said. “It’s very rneaningtul to me.
I want to stay here and continue the wolk that
1 reel is really important and try to make some
sort oflastirlg impact."

If Grimm had vacated the tree presidency,
the position would have been filled imme-
diately hy a special election, as per the SGA
Constitution. Grimm could not have returned
to his role as SGA vice president had he res
turned after the end of next semester.

Broken glass, but safe
meteorites
Around 8 pm. on Thursday, sept. 23, a

piece of glass was broken in a meteorite dis
play case in Noyce. Physics professors William
Cast: and Damon Spaydc removed the meter
or-rtcs, hut in the ncxt {cw days, rumors tlew
that the mcteoritcs had been stolen,

Charles Cunningham, cluur or the physics
department, said via email that it is uncertain
whether the glass was broken in an attempt
to steal the meteorites, an act ofvantlalism, or
was mCrCly nn accidentwhen Professors Case
and spaytic mined at the exhibit, thc glass was
broken but not dislodged from the case. After
some students touched the glass, it hrolte and
fell loose on the ﬂoor and insIdC the cabinet on
the sliclfwhcrc the meteorites were locﬂlcd.

At that point, Case and spaytlc removed
the meteorites from ll display case, in order
to protect them, according to Cunningham.

The cast: is part oftlte display known as the
Pl 'slcs Historical Museum, and a description
of the meteorites still remains in the mostly
empty case. It explains how Grinncll's ﬁrst
mctceritcs came tron. H.H. Nininger, founder
and director ofThc Amcrican Meteorite Labs
oratory, Niningcr used the meteorites as pit/'-
mcnt for his daughter, Doris, to attend Grin-
nell. When she attended in the 19305, tuition,
loom, and board were only $700.

Since then the collection has bccrl expands
ed through exchange with other Observatories.
Cunningham said the physics department
plans to put the collection of meteorites back
on display soon, but is looking for ways to bet-
ter protect them in the future.

Fire in Younker

losses are," as he does not have any other form
of insurance and he was “an innocent bystandr
er,” said Mulholland.

This was thc first ﬁre in a student room
since Sept. 16, 1991, when a room on Clever
land Second caught ﬁre. According to the
SSH, rhcrc was a “tentative understanding that
it was started by candles.”

The 1991 file in Cleveland Hall spread to
two additional studcn t rooms and caused more
damagc to Collcgc propcrry than thisTutzsday's,
as sprinkler systems were not installed or resrr
dcncc halls liiltil 2001.

In regards to the College's policy on opcu
names in residence lralls,1orrr Cr-ntiy,vrce pres.
ident for strident sCrVicCs, notcd that hc wrotc
a policy hrnning Candles even before the 1991
ﬁre.

Jennifer Klohn, dean for student life, said
that Tuesday's ﬁre served as a reminder that,
“lust one candle is pretty dangerous.”

However, there was no mention etthe Open
ﬂame pohcy in the 2004-2005 student Hand-
book’s section on “Residcncc Life ixLl-lousing."
Furthermore, the “College Housing Informar
tional Quick Guide" distributed to student
rooms by Student Affairs this Fall only cau-
tions that “Candles, Bunsen burners, barbCCuC
grills. . .should never he left unattended." Crady
said that the clause in the Qrick Guide was
“unintentionally worded that way. We don‘t
want Bunscu burners in the residence halls."

Student Affairs plans to hold another “ﬁre
safety" study break in Youniter and to publicize
its policy against open tlamesme as caretul as
you can," said Mulllouand. “In this case, we’re
veryluclcy somehody didn't get injured."
