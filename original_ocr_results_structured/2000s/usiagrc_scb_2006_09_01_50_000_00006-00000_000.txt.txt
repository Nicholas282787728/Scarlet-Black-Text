Inside Man

tttﬁti‘t

Ahhh, heist movies. Be it a
straight-forward “gun and run" like
Dog Day Aﬂcmmm or a multi-faceted
thriller like TI]: 31mg, hci. movies can
otter something for everybody. That
is, ofcourse, unless a hcist movie does
try to offer something for everybody,
which is what [midi Matt attempts
and fails to do.

It starts offsimply enough. Bank,
Robbers led by Dalton Russell (Clive
Owen). Hostages. Negotiatois led by
Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington).
Clevel schemes and nothing what it
seems. Watching these‘ elements come
together in the ﬁrst halt-hour or so
is vastly entertaining. As the plan
became more evident, you start paying
more attention, looking for clues as to
the identity of the “inside man” that
the title promises.

But then something goes wrong.
An entirely out—of—nowhere subplot
appears, involving a 90—something—
year-old wealthy bank owner and the
secret of how he got so darn rich in
the first place,leading to the entirely
unnecessary introduction otMadeline
White (Jodie Foster),whose role is
never ﬂeshed out beyond this one
simple fact: She has a lot ofpolitical
connections. Woopsdesdoo. At this
point, the pace absolutely screeches to
a halt.

While the wheels spin in this
ditch, director Spike Lee doesn't stop
doing his own thing. He keeps things
interesting With some sociospolitical
commentary: Sikh gentlemen being
labeled as “A.tabs”by the police and
young children playing Grand Theft
Auto-esque video games. Ofcoursc,
the problem with this is that these
mini-commentaries are far more
interesting than the sralled main plot,
so we are reluctant tojump back into
the actual movie,

This subplot distracts so much that
when the “inside man" is revealed (and
that’s stretching the term quite a bit),
we have no clue who he is.

The savmg grace for this picture,
however, is the performances. Denzcl

Washington is kooky as hell here and
he’s great at it. Clive owcn's pertur-
mance makes me wish he were going
to be the next James Boiid.Jodie
Foster overacts, but at least this gives
us a good reason to hate her smirky
attitude. Christopher Plummet may
not look 90.131“ he certainly sounds
and ‘JCtS like a haunted bank honcho.

All in all, this movie would stall
a lot more ifit wcrcn't for some grcar
performances to keep things interest
ing.

The Confederate
States of America

tittﬁ

05/1: The Colﬂrlemfe Slam tif/Imel—
in! is based on a simple premise: what it
the South had won the American Civil
War? The film bases its alternate his—
tory entirely on speculation and wild
postulations. Nonetheless, anyone in-
terested in the dynamics of American
history is advised to watch this ﬁlm. Be
mindful, however, that some ofthe con-
tent could be offensive.

The ﬁlm is a mock documentary (or
mockumentary), complete with grainy
piccures and interviews with “hismr
tians.” It is framed as a BBC telecast,
and even includes advertisements with
racist themes and negative portrayals of
blacks, imagining the culture of a slave—
holding Confederate states.

CS/I gives an accurate portrayal of
events up to the battle of Gettysburg,
but everything afterward is ﬁctional.
English and French intervention in
that battle produces a rousing Conrede
erarc Victory that results in the sack
ing of northern cities like New York.
Meanwhile, Abraham Lincoln is exiled
from the former US. to Canada, which
becomes a stronghold for annslavery
groups, and Jefferson Davis assumes
the presidency.

Highlights in this alternate his-
tory include the sale of slaves in the
North, the outlawing of non-Christian
religions, the incorporation or South
America into the CSA, and a cold war
with Canada. Women never get the
vote, either.

Though the falsity of (38/15 assets

A mm inferraglllim in Inside Man.

trons is plainly obvious, the ﬁlmmakers
still did a wondrous job of marketing
the material as fact. Even with this in
mind, the implausibility of the sug~
gestcd events is excessive. The film
becomes childish and ridiculous by
commercializing slavery in the extreme
and portraying a society that tolerates it
unthinkingly
Whether one observes the film in
the mind frame ofa skeptic or a belieVr
er is contrary to the point, however. It
is, itnothing else, a series ofmusings on
what might have been in this country,
and a humorously biting satire of some
contemporary issues, such as present
race relations and questionable wars.

Before the Rain
tittﬂt

Film is a visual medium. Director
Milcho Mnnchevski was fully aware of
this when making E: or Mr: Rain, an
atmospheric moVie set during the Bale
ltan unrest of the ’90s. Rich imageryi
dreary weather, deserted Macedonian
landscapes, opulent religious artwolki
develops the story and characters, illu-
minating truths in a way only picniies
could. Excessive dialogue would dis-
tract from the impact of the ﬁrst en»
counter between a Macedonian Chi-is-

COURTESY ARENACINEMA.COM
tian and an Albanian Muslim and the
haunted eyes ofa war photographer. A
compelling and talented cast—along
With Manchevski‘s intimate storytell-
ing style, dependent on close, revealing
shots of his actors—delivers the emo»
tional intensity and sympathy needed
for the film to succeed. in particular,
Gregoire Colin gives a noble parrots
mancc as Kiril. the silent monk whose
facial expressions and simple actions
open the movie and establish its medic
tative tone.

Using these tools of images and act
tors, Manchest produces a tale (Clair
ing the lives of three people in vastly
different situations that, despite its
foreign setting, maintains contempos
mry significance. The destructive force
of hate is alvmys a popular theme, but
Manchevski's unique approach avoids
war movie cliches and presents a story
relevant to any viewer. Through the
intricate relationships between the
characters and their reactions to the vi—
olencc surrounding them, Manchevski
poses poignant questions about how
one interacts and participates in one's
community. Just as his characters find
that their lives are linked in unexpectr
ed ways, viewers of Manchevski’s film
connect with the larger woild as they
witness the hate common to all human
experience.
