more ralenred rhan rhey are direeied. bur rhere's a huge upside ro rhar in rhe
sysrern," head coach David Arseneaulr said.

- Team screngihs: Grinnell will once again be running "The sysrem" of
Casi—break. threeapolnl oirense coupled wirh coproirs subsrirurions. Everyone
on rhe ream shoors ar leasr 100 rhrees in every praerice, and Arseneaulr said he
is seeing a lor ofgood shoorers emerging. "Overwhelmingly, we're going ro be
very rough marehups Cor reams, because we can piir Two guys on rhe ﬂoorwho
can shoot," he said. "There are lors of reams wirh rhrce good perimerer der
renders, bur I don'r know any wirh hve."

- Team weaknesses: The Pioneers losr a lor of leadership to graduarion,
and Arseneaulr said a new leader will have ro rake eonrrol during games, "Ar
rhis poinr, no a lirrle brr ouier on rho iioor." Arseneaulr said,

Wood said serrrng rhe rrap could give the ream rrouble early on as well.

- Early indicators: Arseneaulrsaid he is happy wirh rhe overall look oflhe
ream so far. "Talenrwise and skillwise, we're probably boner rhan we were lasr
year," he said. "The question is wherher or nor we can form rhar same cohe»
siveness we had lasr year."

Players agreed. “This year, our ream looks very sharp for ihe beginning of
rho season." Nick Malinowski '04 said. “We have a grear deal ofralenr, and
rhis helps things come rogerher a lirrle more quickly in the beginning ofthc
season.

“I feel rhe ream will be berier overall than lasr year's championship ream,"
Wood said.

- Conferenee ourloole The MWC is improved From lasr year with Ripon,
Beloir, lllinois College. Monmourh, 5r. Norberr and Grinnoll all rerurning
srrong reams. "We could be berrer than base year and srill nor ﬁnish ar rhe iop
orrhe conference, hurl don'r rhrnk we'll go down wirhour a ﬁghr," Arseneaulr

~ Tearn srrengths: Players have been in werghr irarning since lasr spring,
and Wood said rlie ream is in berrershape than ever-

The iearn also has a new arrirude rhrs season "We're nor riisr saying, 'Ler's
ger rogerlier, be a good, closedcnir group. have run and lcr rhe score fall where rr
wrll,"' Wood said. “We really cvperr and believe rhar we should be making
irnprovernenrs. We'll hold ourselves aerounrable."

The Pioneers also reriirn srrong posr play in HAM-r50“, lensen and Tai
Duncan '04, who ﬁnished rhird in rhe eonlerence in rebounds lasr year wirh
114,

- Team Weaknesses: The small roster is making ir hard for die Pioneers ro
be a “40-minure ream," Wood said, Also, much of rho ream has never seen
collegiaro playing crnie. “We know wliar ir looks like in praerioo, bur not against
orher college players yer," Wood added.

- Early outlook: Despite rrs 220 record lasi year, rho ream is oprrmrsric
aboui in prospecrs. We look promising rhis year," Duncan said. “I don'r know
oranyorie in our conference rhar will be able ro sueecssrully conrain our big
people. Our girards have been working really hard on defense and per-recririg
rheir shors, and will dehnirely be mulriraeered rhrears ibis year."

Wood echoed Duncan's oprimism, “Every year you srarr our cnrhusi'd ie,
rhen you ger a rasre or realiry and back off," she said. "This year, we are nor
going ro back off."

- Conference ourloole Lasryear's champion Lake boresr losrsome key srarrers

Duncan said she is looking forward ro rhc challenge. "We plan io hnrsh
