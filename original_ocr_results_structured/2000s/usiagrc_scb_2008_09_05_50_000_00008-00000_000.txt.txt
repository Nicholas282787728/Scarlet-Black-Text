Before you even see the new RLC of
Clangrala, Rachel Meseke, you will notice
her voice, which she describes as a southern
twang mixed with a Chicago accent."
Meseke may sound like an outsider, but as
. ii small town girl herself, she’s actually right
at home. “I grew up in Shoboniet, Illinois. an
hour away from St Louis and went to school
at Illinois Wesleyan, so ‘l’m used to the whole
small town thing,” she said
Like many students, Meseke was especi ,

It is hard not to smile when you enter Chris
Bylone’s ofﬁce. You are greeted not only with
upbeat tunes and large jars otcolortul candy,
but also with Chris's bright, chccry faceHis
positive attitude
and outlook on
life makes it very
easy for students
to come to him
for help it they
may need it.

Bylone, the
new RLC for
N o r t h r E a s t
campus, grew up
in New Jersey and attended Rutgers Univer—
sity, where he received his bachelor’s degree in
science and Agricultural Ecology.

While attending Rutgers, Chris met his
role model in life, a dean of students named
Francine corlcy “She’s my motivation tor go-
ing on as far is l have, and has not only helped
me but I’m sure other students as well,” Chris
said.

Before he had received the phone call about
the RLC job opening, Bylone, like many othr
ers, had never heard of Grinnell College. But
shortly after he had accepted the job, Chris fell
in love With the campus.

“I really loved the idea otseltrgovernance, it
spoke a lot to me,” Bylone said. “There should
not be a disconnect between the student body
and the professional staff members. We're all
here as one big community and we need to be
creating the rules together."

In keeping with his upheit personality, Bye
lone has a passion for music and dance. “On:

”We’re all here as one
big community, and
we need to be treating
the rules togethet”

ernance policy Self— -governance is important
because part of college should be growing up
and beco ng an adult, ”Meseke said

Such insight comes naturally to Meseke,
whose patentbboth high school teachers—
inspired her to pursue a career in education.

, “I always had the education hug," she said.

Her favorite experiences as an RLC so
far this year have been meeting all of the
students in her cluster and being constantly

on h favorite baseball team the Cardinals,
knitting a scarf for the winter months ahead
or sirnplv reading a book in the company 0
her betta fish Phinnens.

And ifyou enioy watching (751', The Claret,
or L011, feel free to stop by her apartment and
catch an episode. Meseke doesn'r eat choco—
late, but she will most deﬁnitely provide you
with some Cheetos, her favorite snack food,
instead,

So if you're a Cardinals fan. a CSI butt,
or just hungry for some cheesy snacks, make
sure to stop by Langan for a friendly face and
some soothing twangy words.

of my not-so-hiddcn talciits is that i know
how to teach dance," Bylone said. “I want to
start teaching and dancing again just for fun."

In addition to possible dancing sprees,
Bylonc’s job as an RLC will no doubt s'oon
provide him with other forms of fullrfronr

most bizarre thing he's experienced so far at
Grinnell, Bylone responded, “The year’s only
just begunilisk me again afterl see the track

Jim McCarthy
Smounker

EVANALYSSA MARTINEZ

From his love of T/Jlmdm'Ca/r'to his obses-
sion with Rachel Leigh cook, Jim McCarthy,
the new RLC tor Smounker, just might be the
sweetest guy on campus.

Residents of Younker Hall who haven't
seen him yet may have already heard the souls
ful sounds of his piano or guitar music, since
McCarthy can play both instruments by ear.

lfyou're still not convinced ochCarthy’s
sweet nature. just consider his main role model
in life 7 his
mom. “She’s
the most int
crerlihle per
son I've ever
met in my
life,” McCa-
rthy said, “and

”/justrea/ly love talks
ing to people,"
Jim McCarthy

slic’s overcome so much,"

A horn listener, McCarthy is naturally
suited to the role ofan RLCJ‘I love getting to
know the students and their personalities," he
said.“I guess you can say that's one ofmy hohr
hiss. I really just love talking to people."

When searching for a job, McCarthy aCt
tually had his choice between 15 different int
stitutions, but ultimately decided on Gl‘lnnell,
in part, peihaps, because it reminded him of
his hometown, Buffalo, New Yolk. “The diive
through Grinnell was much like the falmlands
ofBuffalo," he said. “I felt right at home."

And so fat, McCarthy’s time at Grinnell

Brenda Hunt
Jamaland

BY SUNANDA VAIDHEESH

With her passions for cold pizza and Bar-
rack Obama, Brenda Hunt, the new RLC
for Jamaland, is just like rhe. average college
student—only with a better dorm room.

Before she had ever eien thought of colt
iege, Hunt had big dreams of becoming a
doctor or a fashion designer. But those career
aspirations quickly fell to the side when she
realized Ll'iat she could pursue her true pass
non—working with students. ‘I asked some
people, and they told me I could do this tor a
living-work with students for a living—and
l was like, ‘yay!"’I-Iunt said.

As a native of the Grinnell-sizcd town
Mount Pleasant, Michigan, Hunt said she
particularly loole fonvrud'to huilding rela-
tionships with her residenns, and she hopes to
be very visible and make her presence felt in
the Gnniiell community.

A true college student at heart, Hunt can
relate to the. average Grinnellians unhalanced
diet, since her favorite food is pizza and she
“can eat it cold five times a week." Hunt

warns all ﬁfsf‘yeals (due to her own personal .

eStperiences at Central Michigan University)

. against taking otit credit cards and trying to

drive home from a party 60 miles away at 3
a. m. with no maps oi a sense ofdirection

In addition to her a a. m. road trip, one of
her most vivid college memories is when she
shared an apartment with a guy Guys are
. a lot more different than girls are," she sai .
“That’s a year or my life l’ll never get back."

Many Grinnellians have already taken no
lie: of Hunt’s energetic and sassy personality,
something she in part attributes to the duality
that comes with being a Gemini. "I’m all over
the place!" she said. “I have two very separate
ways ofdolng things." And ifHutit were to

said, I’d deﬁnitely take somebody/s money to

Like any qualiﬁed RLC, Hunt already
believes herself to he a good judge of char-
acter, but she would still love to be able to
read minds. In particular, she’d like to spend
a day' in Barack Obumas mind. “We all be-
lieve in him,” she said “Blrt does he believe
in himself?”

Even though she may not b ble to read
your mind, Hunts cooking abil es are sure
to entice many visitors. Her spe alty' is sweet
