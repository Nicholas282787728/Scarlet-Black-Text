Storm causes millions of dollars in damage to city

The storm that tore through the city of Grmnell last
week lasted only 20 minutes, but caused over a million dol-
lars worth of damage to city property, and perhaps millions
more to private residences.

Hailstones traveling over 100 miles per hour ripped
apart vinyl siding, destroyed roots, dented cats and sent
several members of Grinnell College's track team to the
hospital with windewhipped bruises after being caught in
the storm mld'run,

The storm hit Grinnell the hardest out of all the towns
in the county, according to the national weather service in
Des Moines.

At the College, the storm left 10 trees damaged, scare
tered debris, wrecked several windows and screens. dams
aged the roof of the new athletic facility and blew part of
the pole vault measuring standard into a fence near the
track,

"Compared to the west side of town, I say we got orf
pretty easy,” said Mike Burt, Assistant Director or Facili—
ties Management. “It only took us about five work days and
six people to clean up campus”

For the city of Grinnell, cleaning up from the storm will
cost a lot more.

“For City—owned property, I‘m roughly guessing it’s go-
ing to cost $1 million,” said Grinnell Mayor Gordon Can-
f‘icld. Most of that will be spent on repairing the
damage done to city buildings such as the Drake Library
and Stewart building, and removing dents from police cars,
according to Canﬁeld,

The storm affected more than two thirds of the city of
Grinnell, and damaged most houses and structures on the
west side of town, according to Ryan Ness, Building and
Planning Assistant for the town of GrinneIl.

“My house alone will be in the tens ofthousands ofdolc
lars to repair,"Ness said, referring to the halfinch hail balls
that crumpled his shingles, siding and wmdows on his old
Victorian house on the West side. “It's probably just as bad
or worse for the other houses near me,”

The massive damage to homes has brought in a horde
of contractors from Illinois, Minnesota. Kansas, Nebraska,
and even as far as Texas looking to profit offof the storm.
Roughly 40 contractors from outside the state applied
for solicitation permits, according to Ness. Solicitation
permits allow businesses to go to residential homes and
promote their services after the police department runs a
background check on the company, and the individuals.

So far one company has been turned down, and Ness
warns residents to be wary ofconrractors that ask for large
sums ofrnoney up tronr, and to look up all contractors on
the better business bureau website.

“There have been a handful ofcomplaints when signing
contracts with outside contractors,"Ness said. “I think a lot
ofit was the person signing the contract didn’t understand
what the contract entailed."

The inﬂux of outside contractors hasn't slowed the
frenzy of phone calls to local carpenters from residents
looking for home repair. In fact Fred Billion from Fred’s
Maintenance had to turn people away.

“Our phone won‘t stop ringing," Billon said, "Given the
damage to my house, and the rest of the town, it's hard to
keep up,"

The storm shattered his windows, ﬂooded the inside of
his house with ice and glass and stripped off vinyl siding
and part orhis root, all ofwhich has to be replaced. He said
he can't even begin to imagine the cost.

“The insurance will help greatly,” Billion said. “This is
an experience I don't wish to repeat,"

Billion‘s insurance agent, Bob Larson of State Farm.
one of 22 insurance agents in Grinnell, has received 200
homeowner claims and 150 automobile claims, and pre-
dicts more will follow.

“We'll be working these claims for three weeks or a
month," Larson said. _

Like Canﬁeld, he is unable to estimate exactly how
much all ofhis claims Will be worth, but he's sure that there
will be lots ofwork in town for residents and independent
contractors alike.

“It won’t belong for [outside contractors] to find work,"
Larson said. “The local folks can only do so much work,"

Outside contractors like Ben Schmitt ofSchmitt Roof—
ing from Burnsville, Minn. has already completed over five
dirferent repair jobs since they came into town Monday.
The company has acquired a solicitation license from the
town of Grinneli.

“We’re not here to steal work from the local people,"
Schmitt said. “We thought coming here would be a good
opportunity for us, and to help the town here."

Schmitt Rooﬁng, which has ofﬁces in Des Moines,
Colorado, Kansas and Oklahoma, has already done cons
struction in other areas where last Tuesday’s storm hit in
Cedar Falls and Waterloo. ’

Schmitt Rooﬁng opened an ofﬁce in town with the in»
tent ofstaying here for five years in order to establish cred-
ibility in the community, and allow costumers to approach
them if there is a problem with the repair.

“A lot of people don't know which are the good cone
tractors and the bad ones," Schmitt said, “That becomes a
problem {or the good contractors to assist people."
