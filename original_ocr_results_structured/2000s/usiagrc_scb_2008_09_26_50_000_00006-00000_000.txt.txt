At o: 00p ..in on a sunny Friday afternoon, when the week»
end dismissal bell ﬁnally rings at schools across the Midwest.
two Grinnell Sixteenthrgruders wait on the stoop orthe CDO
for a ride to the local middle school. Victor Colussi '09 and
Ben Howort '09 are the leaders of Kids'Art, a group that helps
Grinncll middle schoolers to complete weekly art projects.

On the way over to Grinnell Community Middle School,
Marisa Whitley '09, another member of the club, joins them,
and the three make a quick stop at McNally’s to pick tip some
after school snacks

“They re gonnago crazy, "Colussi said, picking upapackage
of Peanut Butter Oreos.

As it turns out, middle schoolers go crazy even without the
added inﬂuence of sugary cookies. “I was a little freaked out
[the first time I went] because it was a buncll oflittle kids runr
ning around with scissors,” Coliiss‘i said.

He speciﬁcally mentions one girl who was fond of chasing
boys around the room.

“Oh, I loved her,"I-Iowart said, while Colussi and Whitley
describe her as “feisty."Still, the group is pretty relaxed when it
comes to dealing with such feisty youngsters. “One rule,"HOWr
art said. “Don't die."

When they get to the art room they're greeted loudly by 16
children ranging from fifth to eighth grade. Before they start
the projects, everyone goes around and says their name, grade,
and favorite food: chocolate and mac rind cheese are givens,but
olives and brains come as a surprise,

Since it is early in the year, the project for the day is to make
signs to hang up around school advertising the club, though as
the year goes on the group will use more materials and tech-
niques. Kids'Art has created tierdye, gingerbread houses, paper
jellyﬁsh, masks, toothpick houses, and once “had a dance and
drawryour-feeljngs kind or thing,” colussi said.Once a month,
Tilly Woodward, curator at the Faulconer gallery, comes and
leads the group in bigger projects, the most memorable of
which was a giant ceramic birdbath.

Kids’ Art—or “Art Club" as the kids themselves call it,
(since they're NOT kids)—has been around since many current
Grinnellians were in middle school themselves. Colussi and
Howorr, who currently run the group, both became involved by
chance, and Colussi and Whitley aren’t even Art majors. Artis-
tic ability is deﬁnitely not a prerequisite. “It’s not an art thing,
it's a kid thing for me,” said Whitley.

For the kids, too,Art Club is more about the company than

. the art itself. “It’s not serious," said Eleanor, eighth grade, as

several years. “It’s an indescribable pull," she said, with a touch
of sarcasm.

Art Club does seem to have a cult followingrmost of the
kids have been coming since firth grade, and many of them had
siblings that participated before them. “I kinda got hooked,"
said Amber, eighth grade. “I love doing are] like to draw dragr

Hopefully once the word gets out, more Grinnellians will
be as enthusiastic about Kids Art as the kids are about Art

Club. “We are looking for people to join us,"Howort said. “You
don't have to have experience with kids."

And as realvworldrdeprived college students, there are oth
er advantages to Kids’ Art thanjust crayons and Peanut Butter
oreos. “it's a really relaxed Friday afternoon activity,"Whit.ley
said. "You get to hang out with people younger than you, which
most college snidents don’t get to do."

And for the kids, hanging out with college students isn't
so bad either. “Victor's cool,"Amber said. "At least, he is at art
club."

JRC student art program grows, faces problems

Student Affairs to purchase works of art made by students and hang them throughout the Rosenfield Center

sociate dean of students, Dougharty said he

For student artists at Grinncll, the Smith
Gallery and the Student Salon offer the best
chances to exhibit work and learn the process
of installing art in a public space. However, the
proposal from Vice President for Student Af-
fairs Houston Dougharry last year to buy stur
dent art and exhibit it in the Joe Rosenﬁcyld 25
Center offered a new opportunity for Student
Affairs. It began with the purchase of four stu»
dent works by Student Affairs and SGA and
could create even more options for student tittr
ists in the future.

Three of the works bought last year came
from the Student Salon and one came from
the Salon de Reﬁtsees, an alternate exhibition
held in a house offcampiis for works that were
not accepted into the Studentt Salon. Dough-
arty said theJRC was an ideal location.

“It’s a very central place, and it has a lot of
spaces for students to do what they want to
do,” he said. “We’re trying to make it less ster-
ile, because it does feel that way sometimes."

The idea of putting art in the JRC came
from his first encounter with the building,
but the importance or the idea orbuying stu—
dent art came from two earlier experiences in
Dougharty's career. As an undergraduate at
the University of Puget Sound, which bought
student art and displayed it all around mm,
pus, he would often see alumni who came back
with their families to show them the art they
had created as students. “It lets alumni feel
like they are a permanent part of their school,"
Dougharty Said.

At Iowa State, where he also served as as

liked how the art they bought became part of
a larger, permanent collection of alumni art
that also expanded our of the student union,
where it was housed, and into student rooms
on a rental basis.

At Grinnell, he said he envisions this
“Rosenfield Collection" as eventually doing
the same thing, and inaybc even more qurckly,
since the JRC, despite its size, does not offer
many walls that accommodate artwork.

“The architect [Cesar Pelli] sees this build-
ing as a piece otart, so we have to tread lightly,"
Dougharty said.

Student Affairs and SGA have enlisted
Milton Severe, the Director of Exhibition De—
sign at Falconer Gallery, to help them install
the works in the JRC. He saw the problcnis
ofinstalling art in the JRC not only in terms
of artistic intent but also in terms of practical
matters.

“Most of the white space that’s [in the
RC] is in .1 dark hallway that's really skinny,”
said Severe.The only student art placed so far,
by Knmnll Gin ‘10 (and star; ad designer),
is in such a hallway on the third ﬂoor of the
building.

Severe also thought that the rental system
might be difficult to accommodate. “We used
to have a rental system, and you could rent
stuff for about three bucks a semester," Se-
vere said. “The problem was that the logistics
were a nightmare.” The inability of the busy
Falconer staff to regulate how students treated
the collection and the chaos of the check-out
and chcckrin days, which no one In the Galr

lery had the extra time to work, led to much of

it eventually being sold off or incorporated in
the permanent collection, which then became
viewable in the Print Room of Burling.
Despite these issues, students were still
energized around the idea, “We need art that

Eliyah Afzal '11. “It depends on what the art
