Police search three rooms on campus

One arrest warrant pending after marijuana seizures; police may bring more charges, says officer

BY DAVID ARCHER

Last week local police seriiched
three rooms and seized "high-grade"
rnanjuana,hrrr they made no arrests and
have yet to press chargesaccording to a
representative of the Jasper/Powcshick
County drug task force involved wrth
the case.

Shortly before 4:30 pm. on Tues-
day, Jan. 25 two task force agents with
a search warrant entered East Hall
with the assistance of campus security,
searched a room and seized evidence
that supported their ongoing inver
tigation. The task foice had seized “a
large quantity of high-grade marijuana“
from rhc suspect elsewhere. A warrant
for the suspects arrest is pending in the
prosecutor’s ofﬁce of the Poweshiek
County district court house, but the
student left the state before the search
began, according to CaptainTim sittig
of the Grinnell Police Department,

The police department has not yet
decided itthe Case is serious enough to
ettradite the suspect, according to Sit»
tig. The agent directly involved in the
case, however, said they would “absot
lrrtely exrradite" him and that ﬂeeing a
criminal investrgatiorr is a felony

Tom Crady, vice president for SIU‘
dent Services, said the police departs
mom was ripped off by a pacloage ret
ceived by the city post office. The task

force agent would not conﬁrm the tip
but said, “It's common to woik hand~
inthand with the Postal Service, FedEx
and tips, regarding suspicious pack-
ages.

The second and third searches out
curred on VVednesdnyL an. 26 in Cleve~
land Hall and were not directly related
to theJan. 25 search and seizure in East
Itlall. Two drug task force agents ens
tercd Cleveland with campus security,
but did not have search warrants and
instead say they intended to “locate,
identify and spealt” with someone to
hclp an ongoing investigation.The or:
ﬁeer then asked the student if he could
seaich the room, and after receiving
consent, found and conﬁscated "user
amounts” of “high-giade marijuana,"
according to the agent. The ofﬁcei said
interviewing pcoplc is standard proce-
dure, and that people orton Consent 10
searches in residences and vehicles even
when ofﬁcers lack search warrants.

The ofﬁcers said he then smelled
“burnt marijtianu,”coming from Cleve»
land Pit.Thcy knocked on a dorm room
door, and according to some witnesses,
initially said they were “housekeeping.”
The officer would not conﬁrm whethei
he had used such tactics,but said courts
have previously ruled that ofﬁcers may
use deception to advance an investigat
tion.The agents asked to search a room,

where they contiscated drug piliilpliert
nalia and higl grade mntijuann and
poured out beer because the students
were under 21 No airests have l>ccn
made and no charges pressed, as the in
vestigariorrs remain open. Charges r .
pending on three to ﬁve individuals, he
said.

The agent said the marijuana from
the three incidents has not yet been
tested for THC content, but that his
years of experience in law enrorcement
led him to believe the marijuana was
porcrrt, high-grade. it is gene rally imt
ported from the west Coast and true
dents often obtain it directly from out
ofstate, oi from other students with out
ofstate contacts, according to the Ofﬁ’
car, He added that students rarely have
much contact with local drug dealers.

“I haven’t seen a lot orcrossing over
those boundaries," he said.

Some students have questioned
what right police ofﬁcers have to step
foot on campus, but Tom crady said,
“It's an absolute fallacy that the police
cannot come on campus."

"We view the police as providing
security, and they've got to have access,”
crady said.

The Grinnell Police Department
said officers may legally walk through
out campus, including through res'it
dence halls without ofﬁcial consent of

SERGE GIACHETTI

the college. The right or privacy starts
at the dorm room, not the hallway, they
say, adding that the police patrol the
campus altnost every day via foot or
bikcr “Nothing forbids us fiom taking a
stroll through campus," ati ofﬁcer said.

ctady said the polrcc have been
on campus to investigate drug activity
nrore in the last year, in part because
lawn is in the midst of a methams
phetnminc (meth) epidemic that has
increased funding for drug task forces
around the state.

The Jasper/Poweshielt county drug
task force, for instance, receives fedeial
funding fiom the Justice Department,
which it uses for searches such as thosc
performed on campus last week.

Although meth has been the pri»
rnary concern ofmany ofthe drug task
foices, a representative of the Grinnell
Police Department said they have made
more marijuana than meth arrests in
the pilst six months, though the reverse
was true a year ago,

“The feds are all over this part of
town," crady saidThe college has been
cooperative with the police department
because they view it as the only really
successful deter-rent to drug use on
campus. “All the awareness programs
we've done have failed,"Crady said.
