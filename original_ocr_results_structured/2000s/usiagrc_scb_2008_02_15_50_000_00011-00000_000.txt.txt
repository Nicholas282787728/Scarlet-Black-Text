\Nhelt thc nustues rpproucd Grinncll's
new ﬁnanciul aid plan, tlrc cxcrtcrnc-nt out—
weighed the xpoctnncy. By 2016, graduat-
ing seniors will have a maximum of $8000
in neednbased debtiand hopolnlly no debt
at all. Accordrng to
the new plan, not
only are debts li
itcd. but loan for
givcness programs
will be beefed
up. Additionally,
Grinnell will ﬁnally
recognize socially
conscious activities by extending $2000 or
loan forgiveness for students who engage
m a “socially responsible summer."

But Grinncll's revamped System comes
months after other colleges, like Swartli—
more and Williams, announced more dras-
tic and dramatrc
plans to target ﬁr
nancial aid. While
Grinnell has been
working to organ
nizc this new sysr
tern, it was only
after other schools
announced their
plans that we came
forward—arid halﬂreartedly
at that. Grinnell is constantly a half-step
behind innovation.

Grinncll tends to wait too long and
constantly judge its progress by its peers.

instead chose to the cautious and conservative
route to become just another competitive libr

limiting loans to $2,000 and relying on

have sent a strong message of commit-

with a wellnmeaning and positive program

spirit of equality that motivated the Fret
gram initially.

Grinnell College is an amazing place,
but it constantly falls short of its potential.
wt are always afraid and conservative when
it wines to running the school—we spend
little and hesitate often. Had we acted
quickly, it would have been our school, not
Williamsy that was hailed as a leader. Let’s
hope that in the future, the college chooses
to act boldly and take risks, rather than set»
tling for beingjust one of the crowd.

Grinnell on its list of schools where “stu-
dents ignore God on a regular basis.”That's
