Framing place photography

“Druid ciiltule” may seem dead, but some humans still
dwell ‘in those intricate spaces between spirit and nature,

Bill Witt, an Iowan photogrnphcr who finds spiritual
solace ‘in the prairie, epitomizes the modern druldilnT
sofrr as he remains powerfully connected to the natural
world around him,This past Wednesday at 4:15 in Bucks-
bauin 152, Win presented a select collection of his pho-
tos to the Grinnell community, primarily faculty. While
Witts photographic career did not reach fruition until afr
ter retirement hes been snapping prairie landscapes since
he was 18.

Witts presentation serves as the third and final ins
stallment of the “One Place, Three Lenses" photography
series arranged by the Center for Prairie Studies. “The
ObjCCIlVC of'One Place,Three Lenses’was to examine the
work or photographers at work in Iowa, and discover our
identity as Iowan inhabitants," said Director of the Cen—
ter for Prairie Studies Jon Andelson, Anthropology. The
series investigated other facets of Iowan cultureirhe two
preceding guest photographers presented on urban work
as well.

Despite proceeding more or less informally, the presen-
talion was smooth and welcoming. After brieﬂy introduc-
ing himselfand his work,Witt read a lengthy excerpt from
his most recent publication “Enchanted by Prairie." Ac—
companied by poetry chock-full of double entendres that
reference nature, the publication catalogs over 30 years of

Witt’s visits to 29 prairies—only one ofwhich is an arti»
ficial reconstruction, all the others have endured naturally.
To 'visiially convey his message, slides of Witt’s photos
glossed over the projector screen throughout the reading.

When his reading finished, Witt asked the audience
which direction they would like the presentation to a",
sueihislorical anecdotes about the photographs or ar-
[lSUC analysis. The latter received unanimous agreement.
Many insightful critiques were offered from both rhe
creator rind the audience. This reporter especially enjoyed
local photographer Barb stahl's distinction between pere
serial and representative photographs. While personal
photographs are artistically subjective and capture pree
cise moments, representative photos portray scenes more
conventionally and objectively. “The close proximity and
unique conditions in certain photos show that [Witt] was
keenly observing the prairie,” Stahl said. one particular
photograph capturing a monarch butterﬂy perched plumb
upon a trill purple snapdragonjustif‘ies a personal phot0*
graph. However, Witt is more renowned for his reprer
sentative depictions of vast rolling prairies and immense
sweeping skies.

As expected, the event closed with a brief commer-
cial advertisement for his book. As a true prairie fanatic,
however,Witt said The performances ofa prairie will go
on regardless ofwhether we are there The prairie doesnt
need to advertise."

The ﬁlm follows th feot’ a half-Yup’ik 13'-y

brought toge aver‘the past few rrion’ths

The teehn n1: side- of trying to put together-r a ﬁlm
event IS incredibly complicated We are having an HD cairi
rented from Des Moines, we have to make sure it works
with our tape,’ said Cultural Films Committee Member
Terri Geller, English “It takes a lot of work and a lot or
money to make state of the ar ‘inema toduy.

Moisan hopes the relationship between the school and
the Strand will continue to grow into the future

"We hop e to be able to do it next year, on a more regu-
lar basis, Ivfoisan said. “Maybe once a semester or twice a
semester It is always very difficult because they have dis»
tribution contracts to meet for other films”

The event is part of the Cultural Films Committee’s
effort to give just a bit more to the cinematic experience
for the audience,

“We tire always trying to find uewways to attract more
people, last semester we did the music and cinema together:
We are always trying to find new formulas to show films,
just not a film, but something else," Moisan said ,

» Due to the films family friendly content and univ ~
sally rclatable themes, Moisan sees an opporru niry to bri g
together the entire Grinnell community.

“We want to bring in students and people from town
to the same event,I think this is the most iniportantthing
aboutthis project;w Moisan said. 7’
