This semester's issue of the Grimm/l [ti-vim,

pnnk .1: fuck," siiid thnat‘elll. She explnned tlnr
both ilie eoiirerir and d ign orrhis iiisgiriiie will
be “.i little edgier" than :tst issues of tlie Grinncll
Review. Co-cditor Liz Allen, ‘04 said that the hiy-
out editor had :i “clear artistic vision," with a black
covet inrl new design for pages. “It's golng ro look
very cool." siisl cereditor Skye l-lilolsniol, ‘04.

one ofthe biggest change: in rhe oigsnirnrion
oftlic GrinnellRmiew is in the review committee, .I
group orsriideni yolnrireers who meet ro review
and evaluate submissions. Last year, d-ie review come
mittee reviewed submissions electronically and sub
mitted numerical rniinpsIhis year. d’ie review some
mittee meets twice before the publication of each
issue, which Gennarelli said fostered a “sense of
eornrnuniry among rhose people that were interv
esied In irrirlng" and give more runs for pieces ro
be reviewed. “lryou rush through 80 pieces in one
night, each one doesn’t receive individual attention,"
she explained.

The Grim!!! Rivitw's new approach empha-
sizes learning through dialogue wirh 1 community
of writers and artists. “The whole point is to imr
prove ivrrririg,”snid Hibbatd. Now, the review eoin.
mirree otters oonsrruerive criticism to every writer
who submits to the Grimm/Z Rtl/itlll.
