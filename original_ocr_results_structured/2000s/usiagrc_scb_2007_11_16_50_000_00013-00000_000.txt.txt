Two weeks ago, 19 teams set out to dominate and ultimately win this time—honored tradition of Assassins. You all
probably know how it works: teams must take out their targets with water pistols, while also eluding assassina-
tion from the team targeting them. it sounds easy, until you realize how obsessive some teams get when they start
worrying about their enemies. Unlike any other event on campus, Assassins forces people to sleep in bathrooms,
pee in bottles and lie to everyone around them. it creates rifts among friends and gives people reasons other than
Halo 3 to avoid leaving their room. Assassins: the cause of and solution to many Grinnell problems.

The James Gang

The team of Joey Wendel '11, Johnny Buse
’11 and A] Anderson '11 knew they had to
eliminate their targets quickly. So they tracked
down and surprised an unexpectingJohn Bur-
rows ’10. He had no chance. “We thought he
wouldn't be too hard of a ﬁgure to ﬁnd,” said
Wendel. Burrows appeared out of the corner
of Wendel’s eye at Friday’s Mountain Goats
concert, and Wendel quickly approached him.
After a friendly greeting and some drinks,

Wendel dealt a fatal H20 blow to Burrows’

chest. “I followed it with an apology and a
hug, said Wendel. But his karma evened out
the next morning, when the team pursuing
Wendel arrived at 8 to stake out his room. “I
had to pee in three Gatorade bottles,"Wendel
said. He knew he had to get out and called his
teammates, who arrived to assist him in an es-
cape out the window. But this escape wouldn't
prolong the game. All three teammates were
quickly killed by another member of the at-
tacking team hiding in the bushes.

One assassin’s training regimen

Most Assassins players know srories abour the orploirs
of Brad Bishop ’08, and each year, he tries to outdo himself
Many can claim to love this game, but it wouldn't be excessive
to compare Bishop’s relationship with Assassins to that of a
mother's love for her child. “it provides an outlet for my ten-
dency towards obessiveness,"said Bishop. Proving rhar he will
do anything for the kill, Bishop stood on a chair in a closet for
two hours. Perfectly hidden, he could see rhrough the crack of
the door as his target left her room. She left, thinking she was
safe. But she should have known better—with Bishop after
you, you are never safe. An even longer stake-out involved him
waiting in a car for three hours. Bishop refused to divulge all
ofhis tactics; he plans to play again, and hopefully win. But he
would admit that he did not sleep in his room for the length of
the game. One of his sleeping arrangements? The bathroom
ﬂoor in the basement of Steiner.

Since Andrew Fair ’09 and his teammates, Sam Tape '09
and Scott Melntyro '09, all lived on James 2nd, they decided to
use the help of their ﬂoormates to survive. When they traveled
to the dining hall, fellow James 2nd residents would form a
protective circle around them. Walking in the side door by the
loading dock, their assistants peered around corners until they
reached the coatroom, where they could sprint into the dining
hall. a safety zone. But the paranoia remained, even when in—
side a safety zone. Andrew more than once left his table with
only a cup, pretending to be reﬁlling it. He instead had one
of his friends clcar his tray while he sprinted back to James.
When his putsuer realized he had escaped, he had enough of
a head start to make it back safely. Escape plans didn’t always
run smoothly, though. Fair would sometimes put his tray away
and would give the evil eye to anyone who followed them, then
turn around and get more foodﬁven if they weren’t necessarr

il afterhim.

Konnor Clark .11 found out that his HSC, Josie Gerri—
erts ’10, would be his first target. With HSC responsibilities
rrumping Assassins seclusion, it didn’t take much pondering
for him to come up with a strategy. “All i did was go to her
room to see ifi could reserve rhc lounge for the night," said
Clark. Vthn Clark round the room empty, he pulled Gerv
rictts' cell phone number off of plans. “She was like, ‘I’m just
out and about; becausc she didn’t want to tell me where she
was." so Clark reigned anger. “in in Younker waiting to ice
serve rhc damn loungc,"hc said. Gorrictts told Clark that she
would be back in 30 minutes, and Clark staked out her door.
As she strolled up the stairs, Clark ovcrlroard ocrnetts state,
“I know who two ofrhcrn are, but not the other one." Before
Gertictts could tcact, Clark sprayed her', ending her assassins
experience just because she did her job.

The winning team,Alissa Fleck'10,Meredith Pain'lO and
Nora Frazin '10, decided that coverr ops were not for them.
Playing on a whim, a joke on all those who did not believe
they actually would, rhey used a combinariou of luck, cunning
and the ability to taunt unsuspecting males into coming out of
hiding Knowing that one of their targets did not know them,
one ofrhc girls hysterically cried itbollt a boyfriend while the
others comforted her. The turgers checked up on rho girls and
were surprised to find themselves shot. As for their other ex-
ploits? “A lot ofthe kills were accidental," said Pain. Although
they often killed without planning, Assassins still consumed
much of the three ladies’lives. “Going into it, we didn‘t know
how intense it would be,” said Fleck. “It was all I could think
ilboulim class, falling asleep. There were deﬁnitely things that
l rook for granted, like going ubour life withour paranoia."

. and quick exit

HVMIKE KOBER

In order to develop a steadfast mind and
rigid physique, 1 prepared hardcore for Team
Assassins. I rook on the training regimen of
Nicholas Angel, the over-achieving police ofﬁr
ccr in Ha! Fuzz, who does his duty so well that
he makes everyone else look bad. In addition
to developing u stark British accent,i practiced
jumping out ofWal-Murt aisles and developed
a key eyc for hiding places, such as the srrcks
oquuafrnu. Unlike last yeni,Assnssins’07 in»
volved “teams," so I decided to study the team-
work of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence in
Bad Boyr I and 11, reciting “Now back up, put
the gun down and get me a pack ofTropical
Fruit Bubbalic‘ious, and some Skittles” over
100 times to various confused customers.

In my opinion. the best strategy for Team
Assassin is to (earn up with two partners who
no one would expect you to working with. For
this rcason,l left it up to Greg Hudson ’09,
Assassins mastermind, to assign me to two
random partners. My teammates, Liu Hiurr
ing '10 and Josie Gerriets ’10 made up Team
QC, and we were assigned to assassinate Nora

Frazirr '10,Meredith Pain ‘10 and Alyssa Fleck
’IO,Team Jigsaw.

Our strategy was simple, stay low, until af—
rcr rhc l-lallowccn Hillris parry, and then to nt~
tack with the fervor of Lee Harvey Oswald. In
an immediate, unforseen test to my training, I
icimcd that I hid to host a prospre on the first
day ofthc game. When he arrweri,l brought
him to Rock Creek. where our team made
him practice quick getaways and llldeouts. l
icnr him some military clothing to holp him
blend into the Gtinnell landscape. Because I
had a prospie, I was forced to ignore the first
commandment of the gamc; ““Thou shall not
be soon in the dining hall," the worst possible
move you can make.

Yet bypassing rhc law worked to my ad
vantage. on rhe way out of the dining hall, 1
saw Alyssa Fleck. In the rush of the moment,
I went to pull my gun out of my pockcr too
quickly, and was neurralizcd. 1 now realize the
importance of the second commandment of
Assassin: “Thou shall act stealthily and prepare
for the kill."

For my foolishness, l deserved a quick

death, and my assassin had also seen me leave
the dining hall. lthoughr I saw two girls stalk-
ing me as l walked ro see a movie, but my pros-
pie thought I was just being paranoid. Sud-
dcnly, one orrhe girls pulled a super soaker out
and began to fire away. My prospie and I ran
for our lives, straight through Mac Field and
then onwards past North Campus. We were
pursued until Norris, where we hid for several
minutes and then crept over to Harris. Fortrrr
nately, our first assassins were mere amateurs
(firstryears wrth poor arm) and were eliminated
while I hid in the theater, on the ﬂoor, below
the seats and in the dark.

The next day, Brad Bishop YOS. one of our
new assassins. hid in the lounge of Smith 3rd.
whcrc my teammate Liu lives. He propped
open the door,only one room away, and turned
ofrrhc lights. 0n guard, Liu peeked in through
the door as she passed by, but did not see any
one inside. As she went to unlock her door, she
heard someone run up behind her, and shot her
water pistol on instinct. She hit Brad and was
sate. Withour rhc same luck, Josie was assas-
sinated later that day.

With one reunimntc down, my paranoia ale
most provonred me from going to Halloween
Harris. But because I knew two or my assas-
sins, Brad and Konnor, .md donned a clever,
concealing Halloween costume (Edward Scis-
sorhands),I decided ro give it a go. Ar a pre-
party in Loose,l sawjosie, walked towards her,
and subsequently broke the final command-
ment ofTeam Assassin: “Never speak wirh an
already eliminated teammate in public." It led
to my dcirth.Josic was unaware thar our rhird
assassin, Toby l<athan ’10, planned on hanging
out with her the entire night.

In a hotshot superhero costume, Toby
waited for Lru and I to talk toJosie, and when
i did. he expertly carried out his assignment.
With a jolly killing dcmcanor, l wholchcrrtr
cdly believe that Toby would have won Ass
sassins if not for my doing. I told my target
Nora About their new assassins, allowing them
to neutralize Toby at Harris, where they othr
crwisc would have been killed. My tcrlnl may
have lost, but when Toby, Brad and Konnor
(Term Aviida Kedavms) wound up as the run
ncrs-up ro Team Jigsawl had the last laugh.
