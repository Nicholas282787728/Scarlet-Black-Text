Awaiting the opening of Faultoner Gale

Jinn/ram? Corr/empomryﬂrtﬂ'om Pat-ti} ar, the
crowd grew outside in rhe Bucksbauin otiin-
da last Friday. Virtually unacknowledged by the
public, a woman quietly made her way through
the crowd, Handing out pins, she asked indi-
viduals to mark where they were rroin on maps
posted at the entrance of Fauleoner Gallery

This.unexpected act allowed the audience
to answer the very same question facing the nth
ists. The 21 Portuguese artists featured in the
exhibit trained their responses though a myiir
ad ofartistic media. Rife with ambient sounds.

Fall/rarztr Gar/aye itiiiitotiooa exhibition, Where are you from? contemporary Art from Portugal, attracted a timer-re mix ofGn'mlc/lxluderir: and
irrcirlbur oft)» tammum‘zy. The opening highlighted to: artwork of 21 Portuguese om'm

South'African‘ group to play Sat. night

At the most basic level, the South African
group Ladysmith Black Mambazo just sings.
Eight men use their voices to make beautiful
music, working together to achieve a cohesive,
warm and satisfying whole. A professional and
crisply sung show can be almost guaranteed.

The group had been together for over 30
years before performing at Nelson Mandela's
inauguration in 1994. Even ifyou'rc not a cone
noisseur ofworld music, you may know them
from when they played with Paul Simon in
1985 on two songs oifof his Grate/mil! album.
His controversial move to break the artists'
boycott against South Africa has been debated
since that time,but for Ladysmith it was a nat—
ural step out of the country where they already
had a near-legendary status.

As author Carol Muller explains in her
book stature Afri'rao Merit; A Century ofTrr/rlr
lion in Tiara/initiation, the growth of Lady
smith came out or the isicarhamiya singing
style. Men working in the mines would join
together in groups and practice during their
free time. sometimes singing at major social
occasions in the town. After joining some of
these groups in the factory town of Durban,
Joseph Shabalala came back to his hometown,
Ladysmith, and formed his own group with
ramily and friends.

As one or the best in this style, distin-
guished by a baSStheaVy sound (women were
never in these groups and aims were hard to
rind) and traditional, sometimes strange»
sounding rhythmic accoinpanilntznts, Lady
smith distinguished themselves by their dckll’
cation and tight sound.They received a recortl
deal by 1970, and bcgan iccoidiiig at a quick

pace. which would eventually set them on a
pace to be the preeminent isicathamiya group
in the country .

The group started collaborating with other
artists in their region early, setting a precedent
that would go all the way to Grate/and. In
“Homeless," their strongest collaboration with
Simon, they imprint the song with the sounds
of the aforementioned mining towns Like
most oftheir songs, it evokes a range ofsensa-
tions in the listener: think of dawn breaking
early, of shared experiences, or a tradition or
Willing happiness into a community that has
little reason to be.

Their othei Grate/anti track, “Diamonds on
the Soles of Her Shoes,” doesn’t showcase the
group as well. It doesn‘t as clearly evoke South
African traditions, and the song’s lyrics are so
disposable and vopid as to make Ladysinith’s
presence almost irrelevant

In the context of the platinum-selling
Grace/mid. “Homeless" is almost disquiering
in the sea of synths and '805 snare and Chevy
Chasercoverecl pop tuneswnh Simon's addir
tional singing and lyrics, however, it is becomes
more than an isicathamiya song but rather a
successful blending of that form with Western
musical traditions.

Later collaborations with other Amerir
can singer-songwriteis since haven’t diluted
the cohesiveness or the group. Shabalala still
teaches In South Africa and has recruited his
sons to continue the group in the riiture.Tlicy
still refuse to sacriﬁce the core oirheir music,
to collaborate but not to act as mere “world
music backdrop.

Rcaching out to thc woild tlocsni require

LAWRENCE SuMuLoNo

Ladysmith to sacrifice the principals of the
group. Sometimes world music has a tendency
to be known only for its exotic qualities, or
for a tendency to change its character into
something soulless, more palatable for mass
international consumption. Ladysmith Black
Mambazo, thankfully, has not done either so
far in their long career.
