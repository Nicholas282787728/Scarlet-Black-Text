afraid of cutting and running.

“We need to see this thing to a Slﬂblllzik
tion and not yank the rug out of it," he said.“I
lived through the Vietnam era and afterwards.
We left a lot of people hanging. Three million
Vietnamese died. They got destroyed.”

Bunnell, logically, is leaning toward voting
for Rudy Giuliani, the New York mayor most
Republicans associate with homeland security.

State representative Betty De Boef (R)
echoed Bunnell's statements. “I feel like people
really identify with what the congressman had
to say,"said De Boef.“They're passionate about
issues like Iraq and illegal immigration."

But in all the discussion of kings speech,
no one seemed to remember that itwas Brown»
back who was running for president.

Albright took to the stage after an intro
duction delivered by Wayne Moyer, Professor
of Political Science, and director of the Rosen—
field Program on campus. He noted that the
former Secretary of State has ties to Grinnell,
having delivered a Rosenfield talk in 1990
prior to her association with the Clinton ad
ministration.

The opening comments Albright gave
were succinct. She familiarized the audience
with her work as a part of Clinton’s admin-
istration as well as giving her opinion about
the current state of American foreign affairs,
She criticized the war in Iraq's effect upon the
surrounding area, but also chastised President
Bush for continually failing to pay greater ate
tention to China and Latin America, calling
him “unkdimensional.”

Albright warned that the next president
would have to deal with the situation in Iraq as
well as the countries Bush has ignored. “There
is a great deal to be done in the international
relations area," she said.

After brieﬂy giving her endorsement for
Hillary Clinton, Albright quickly turned at-
tendon to a question and answer session. She
ﬁelded questions from the Grinnell commur
nity—ineluding several students—on topics
as wide ranging as relations with saudi Arabia
and foreign policy in China and the potential
for a reemergence of Russian power in the
world.

Mikel Shybut ‘10, a volunteer working at
the event, believes that such a talk holds spe-
cial signiﬁcance for his generation of voters.
He said the event was “very important for
students of our generation who may not have
been able to experience her when she was in
omce as our parents did or maybe our older
siblings.” He added,“Now is the chance to see
her, ask her questions, and get her thoughts on
the war in Iraq."

Serving up good food in

liv SARAH MIRK

Tuesday night at 6 p.m.,vo1unteers for the
campus John Edwards group wererlt knocking
doors for their candidate: they were chopping
carrots. As part of an emphasis on getting the
Edwards campaign integrated into local com,
munities, the student organizers signed up to
host Community Meal, a free weekly meal
served in the Davis Elementary School caf—
eteria. A half dozen or so members of the ap-
proximate 20 in the group turned up for the
low—key grassroots effort.

There were no banner, no proselytlzing
pamphlets, the only visible signs of the cam-
paign were small John Edwards buttons stur
dents wore as they tossed a vat of salad, ﬁlled
rows of milk cups and helped unfold long eats
eteria tables.

Ellie Shook, county supervisor and an Ed-
wards supporter, watched as John Bohman ’05,
a ﬁeld organizer for the Edwards campaign,
strained the fat oFf a small mountain of ground
beef.

“Edwards is a downhomc type of person
who an relate to everybody," says Shook, who
is from Montezuma, “and he hasn’t taken any

PAC money, there's no one telling him what
to do."

Soon a long line of Community Meal
regulars formed; senior citizens, families and

students stretching to the cafeteria door. EV’
ery week, the meal is cooked and dished up
by a different group from the college and thus
theres always new races behind the serving
table.

Hannah sagin '11 was one ofthe new faces.
She’d come along with the Edwards group and
wore an Edwards pin on her shirt but claimed
to be still undecided on who to vote for in the
caucus.

"I just like plns,”she explained. Sagin, like
many other Grinnellians, is holding off on
pledging herself to one candidate until she
feels there’s one she really trusts and believes.
“It’s really easy to find stereotypes," she says,
“but it’s difﬁcult to find actual unbiased inforc
motion."

Matt Horowitz ’10 stood behind a fold-
ing school tablc piled with silverware as

he explained why he believes undecided
Grinnellians like Sagin should lean toward
Edwards. Horowitz, founder of the campus
Edwards group, says Edwards is the most
progressive candidate on healthcare and en
vironmental issues, noting that he’s laid out a
solid plan for universal healthcare and began
running a carbon-neutral campaign a month
before Clinton and Obama. “I also admire the
connection he had with the middle and work-
ing class" at a campaign event, says Horowitz.
“His campaign isn’t just about becoming presi-
dent, it’s about making a change."

Having the campaign’s social justice ac
tions speak louder than its words part of the
philosophy behind doing community service
events like Community Meal, in addition to
meeting potential voters and raising Edwards
visbility overall.

Sarah Bayer '08, who helps lead the weekly
community meal, thinks the campaign did well
on all three fronts.

"It definitely made Edwards more visible,"
says Boyer. "The old women who come to the
meal always ask who’s hosting that night. It’s
really important to them."
