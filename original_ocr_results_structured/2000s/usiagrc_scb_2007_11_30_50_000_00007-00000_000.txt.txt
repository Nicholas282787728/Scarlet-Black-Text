fAsk Mitt anything—but don’t
fexpect him to be excited

vajetr RADERSTRONG

Mitt Romney stood between the Ameri-
can and Iowan ﬂag, in front of a fireplace
and next to a large sign that read “Ask Mitt
Anything.” His tie was slightly crooked and he
moved around stage
in short, method
ological spurts. His
words were delivered like they had been said
hundreds oftimes before.

The former governor of Massachusetts
spoke on the night ofTuesday Nov. 20, at the
Newton Country Club for about 45 minutes.
During his spccch, Romney hit all ofhis talks
ing points—from lowering taxes to strength
ening family values—as well as getting a few
laughs from the crowd. He
did not linger on any point
too long, even when it came
to the questions at the end,
and at times seemed a little
insincere.

The crowd reﬂected his
luck of fervor. The setting
was very intimate, With
Christmas trees in the back and coffee served
in china cups, making it lcss ofa political rally
and more of a low-key community meet and
greet. Over 100 people made up the crowd,
mostly elderly white persons, with the ocean
sional baby wearing a “Romney 2008" sticker.
They only gave halirhcartcd responses to

Where else he wanted to be.

many of Romneys points and the ﬁrst sponr
taneous applause occurred after a declaration
that young people should wait until after mar-
riage to have children, about midway through
his speech.

Romney took six
questions from the audi-
cncc,and rushed through

each one. once thc question was askedirangr
ing from Darﬁlr to religious tolerance—he
spat out the answer just slow enough for ev-
eryone to catch, and then quickly moved on.
His answers did not go into much detail

It was only after the questions were over,
and Romney began shaking the hands of
those who wanted to, that it ms clear that the
crowd really hoped this man
would one day be president.
Most lined up to get his au~
tograpll, take pictures and
ask him their own personal
questions. Romney obliged
with a smile on, although
without much more enthua
siasm than that. Throughout
the whole cvent, Romney appeared as if he
had something better to do, somewhere else
he wanted to be. It was like he had promised
someone he would run for president, and now
he was just fulfilling that promise,

In town politics, things aren’t always red and blue

IfGrinnell Collcgc was the only source ofpolitical informa-
tion for the upcoming election, there would invariably be only
on: way to vote: Democrat. Both John Edwards and Bill Richa
ardson have visited campus, along with representatives tor Hill-
ary Clinton and the other Democmtic leaders, while the major
Republican campaigns have bypasscd Grinnell,This oncrsided
representation makes it difﬁcult to mediate between the needs
ofRepublicans and Democrats, both on campus and OH.

Most people consider Grinnell to be a left loaning college
Because the Republican representation is low on campus, it is
difﬁcult to attract conservative candidates. “When it comes
down to crunch time here In Iowa, it’s hard [for candid-rites]
to make Grinnell College a priority," said Derek Bates ‘08, co~
leader of the Campus Republicans.

In addition to the luck of Republican candidates, Grinncll
also does not host may conservative speakers, makingit dit-
ﬁcult for those viewpoints to be heiirdr'The

and, among other roles, coordinates cam»
paign events on campus.

Being an active student chublican can
be difﬁcult. In the past, Bates has been as-
saulted for his bcllefs. "I've been called a
Nazi." he said.

“For a kid to bc Republican on this campus takes an cnorr
mous amount of personal courage,” said Dan Bunnell, the
former county chairman for the Republican Party. Bunnell is
very vocal about the negative impact of college student politi-
cal participation “When you get down to the local level, the
college makes a huge difference," he said. “A big vote hero is
5500 people and the College Democrats try to turn out 1000

candidate, but only by a majority of7s votes, Bunnell says that
this was due to the studentvote.
Others share this view, but the political division comes at
the county level, not at the town level. In the 2006 clecV
tion for state representative, three of the four wards
of Grinnell went to the Democratic candidate,
Eric Palmer. All of the outer townships went N
to Danny Carroll, the Republican candidate.
With respect to the 2006 county supervisor
race, when two Democrats defeated two Re-
publicans, “even ifthe student votes had been
left out,I think we would have carried the two
[Democrats]," said Don Smith, chair of the
Poweshiek County Democrats.
Much ofthe argument ofcolleg: students
voting in local elections and having political
inﬂuence over the town and the county stem from
a fundamental question of where colv‘
lege students actually live,either In Grinnell
or back' in their hometown‘ Because I live
here, I'm subject to Grinnell, Poweshiek

Alec Sehierenbeck 09, president ofthe Cole

right and obligation to take part in the politi-
cal process"

This argument is sharcd by othcr stu
dents, especially members of the Campus
Democrats, who urge students to vote in each local and na-
tional election. For major elections, they set up satellite voting
stations where smdents cast early absentee ballots.

But students are not the only ones who feel that they can
vote in Grinnell. “Most students don't vet: in school board,
mayor [elections] But I don't'see why they shouldn’t," said
smith. “snidents are part ofthc community They can vote in
any election they want.”

Looking at the 2006 elections, it can be inferred that college

students will sometimes vote “straight ticket," meaning for all
candidates in one party without reference to their policies. In
the absentee precinct and the ﬁrst ward, where most student
vote, Republicans running unopposed in the 2006 elections
received far fewer votes than a Democrat running
unopposed. Bates said that “or county level, it's
not the party, it’s the character,” and voting
a straight ticket is not an appropriate way to

vote.

The college is located in the first ward and
many students choose to vote absentee at the
satellite voting stations, Both rhosc precincts
contain the majority of the student votes.

Bunnell agrees that students can be unin-
formed about local elections, “If you can’t tell

the names of the people you are voting tor, that’s
criminal," said Bunnell.“And then you leave That
puts a real strain on communityrcollege relations."

But others, particularly students. contest that they are
informed about both national and local elections, and the idea
that they are not is merely a perception. “It‘s really easy to say
Grinncll students are ignorant about local issues and they’re
changing elcctions on blind party preference," said Schicrcn-
beck, who is also a ctr-leader of the Campus Democrats,

Regardless of the arguments, tensions remain between the
conservative activists in town and liberal students on campus,
without out much opportunity for resolution. “The town needs
to understand college perspectives and the college needs to un-
derstand town perspectives," said Bates.

Schierenbeck agrccs. “College students often have a lot of
incorrect assumptions aboutwhat the town is like," he said.

To bridge this gap, some argue the campus should host
more conservative speakers. “If we want to follow the mission
statement [of the college] we have to bring different views to
campus," said Bly.
