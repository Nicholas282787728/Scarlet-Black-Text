Chilean folk octet to appear

lnti-lllimani merge Chops, progressive ideals in beautiful music

BYJUSTIN ERICKSON

Since 1973, the once-exiled Chilean folk
octet Incl-Illimani havc become one of South
America's most outspoken voices for the coir
tinent's oppressed
through their 17
beautiful, distinco
rive music,

Sittcen years
after their ﬁrst
visit to Grinncllr
IntieIllimani will return to continue to spread
their message or hope at 8pm. in Herrick
Chapel next Tuesday. Although the group
now includes a few new mcmbcrs due to r:-
tirement, Inti-Illrmanr continues to perform
various musical styles, including Afro-Carib-
bean rhythms, Italian tarantellas, and Chilean
folk music.

Given the group's political importance and
their wide diversity orstyles, they were a per-
fect fit for Grinncll Collcgc's Public Evcnts
Committee, who discussed the importance or
artistic diversity when selecting Inti-Illimani
to perform on campus, Jon Andclson ‘70, An—

Latrn American group," Andelson said, “The
fact that [Intitlllimani] has existed as long as
they have testiﬁes to the enduring quality of
their music.” '

The group creates its
sound by utilizing over
thirty wind, string, and per-
cussion instruments, In
addition, their “astonishing
vocals [are] dclivcrctl with

Students on the committee expressed a
desire to include more people in these events.

Following the concert, the audience will be

an interaction especially
fruitful for Grinncll stu-

said.

The closest most or us have gotten to In-

that Fab Four knowledge ﬁrsthand, however,
all you have to do is go to scoring-Lewis at
7:30 pm. tonight and see “Divine Melody in
Rhythm Fantasies", a concert from south In-
dian Master Musicians.

Even in Indian music as a whole, south
Indian music, which grew out of Hinduism, is
less \chl-ltnown than its northern counterpart,

which has a stronger Persian inﬂuence. The
focus of this music, which the title of the coin
ccit demonstrates, is on fantasies, or the tells
ing of myths, within an instrumental concept
bascd on rhythm variations on top of divine
mclodic drones.

Roger Vetter, Music explains that the Mus
sic Department, who brought the concert,
“seeks to expose the Grinnell community to
musical experiences they're unlikely to err
counter after their time at Grinnell." Western
music, as a whole, generally hasn't incorptr
rated the unique system of South Indian mu-
src, and given the large part of the world that
listens to it, this concert is a vital way to gain
cultural knowledge while being entertained by
the meditative quality orthe music.

In particular, the audience should focus on
the varying permutations ofmodcs ormelody,
ragamt, and time cycles, rho/nan. that pro-
duce intricate and complex rhythmic patterns
unique to this music.

South Indian music is diffcrcnt from
Western classical music becausc it is not based
on the premise ofan underlying tune and hat-

subtle melodlt line agalhsl a sure

mony layered over a melody. Rather, as Pro—
fessor Vetter explains, “thcrt: is a greater focus
on the subtle melodic line against a sustained
drone, layered with complex drumming."

In addition to the performance, th: Music
Department is also hosting a workshop with
the performers tor the Grinnell community to
interact and engage with them. The workshop
provides the opportunity for students who play
Western instruments to ask questions to these
performers, see the differenccs in their playing
styles and to get a hetter sense of the cross
cultural differenccs and similarities.

So, whether to broaden your musical hoe
rizons, to get in touch with your international
roots, or to :njoy a musical evening orelahoe
rate rhythms woven in with unique melodies,
considerlistening to these South Indian music
masters perform their hearts out.
