Crunch time

In the lame duck Physical Education Complex, practice space is always a hot commodity in win-
ter, but with Darby gone the squeeze has gotten even tighter as a plethora of athletic teams,
club sports and rec ballets jockey for limited practice time and space on the athletic courts

Winter typ‘rcally wears out its welcome in
lowa, and spring break usually marks the end of
chilly mornings. However, studncts and protes-
sors aren't the only ones eagerly awaiting those
warmer days.The Athletic Director and various
athletic teams are also waiting for spring break,
though they may be more focused on what
awaits when they return: the
possibility of more practice
space.

Every winter, a great
number of teams rely on
the Physical Education
Complex {or space, but this
year’s practice space crunch
is particularly acute. Ber
cause Darby Gym was torn
down last year, and Phase
I or the new Athletic Complex is still deemed
a construction site, it is unusable as practice
space. The only remaining option is the PEC,
which had to deal with the demands of eight
sports—men’s and women’s basketball, men’s
tennis, baseball, softball, men’s golf and men's
and women's trackiafter students returned to
campus in midannuary.

To help basketball players, a portable wooden
ﬂoor was brought in to use in the PRC earlier
this season. In lanuary, the new athletic center
was opencd brieﬂy to allow them to use that
gym as practice space.

"VVc always had enough practice space," said
basketball player Caitlin Shannon ‘07,”although
at times it would have been nice to be able to
clean the ﬂoor under the bleachers so that the
bleachers could be rolled back and we could
have used six baskets instead of two."

However, this privilege otusing the new gym
will not extend to spring training for the basket
ball teams, and some players report rumors that
the men’s team will actually be traveling to local
high schools to get more practice space.

“It is very frustrating to have no place to
play,” said basketball player Katie schumachcr

Right now, the PRC has four practice spaces
(including the weight room). sports have to
schedule their practice time around Physical
Education classes which are held during the
day, and open gym which is held from 9:4541
pain. As a result, many varsity sports are having
practice at odd hours,
“For sure [there is a lack of practice spilccl,"
said baseball player Kevin Byrne
‘06. “We have four or- ﬁve teams
all trying to use the same space
which is not even big enough
for one of these teams. Because
there’s so much competition for
space, we end up only getting
an hour and a half on the actual
PEC ﬂoor.” Most teams try to
have two hours or practice each
day
Men’s tennis players were also feeling the
crunch. Neither the PRC nor the new athletic
complex have an indoor tennis
court, something several players

inconvenience is any more extraordinary.

The only exception this year is the lack of
room for rntramurals or unofﬁcial sports, such
as intramural basketball and Grinnell Ultimate
Frisbee.

“We’ve had Darby (for intramurals) but this
year we don’t have time or space for them to
practice," Fairchild commented. While Fairchs
ild suggested unofﬁcial sport teams could use
the gym during open hours, she said she pre-
tcrrcd open gym be devoid otany type of organ
nizcd sports.

For some club teams, however, this has
meant that the already difﬁcult task of getting
quality practice time in inclement weather is
even harder.

“We practice indoors when it’s too cold and
when there's snow on the ground," said Dan-
ny Marks ‘05, a cmcnptain for the men's tris-
bce ream. "we've always had problcms getting
practice times, even before the construction of
the new athletic complex.
Because all the ‘ofﬁcial'

feel is needed.

“Since the track intersects
with the courts, we have to al—
ternate times," said lord-an Lce

”We have four or ﬁve learns all

trying to use the same space which
it not even big enough for one of

sports teams have schcds
uled practice times, we get

nis team, who wished to remain
anonymous, added, “they get prir
ority because they are in season,
which is somewhat unfair since the tennis sea-
son has started too, and we don't get the same
priority"
Dee Fairchild, Grinncll College's Athletic
Director, agreed with the students’ concerns.
“It really is a problem with schools like us,
academically strong, Division 111 schools, such
as Carleton, Wesley, and Smith," said Fairchs
ild, “especially the northern schools who really
have a problem starting Feb. ,1 when the avail—
ability of practice space becomes dependent on
weather. When it is 32", 34", 36”, teams are our
side practicing." However, Fairchild went on to
explain laclt or practice space has always been a
problem and she doesn't feel like this year the

Organizers and Faiichild hope tempcraturcs
will warm soon so other sports will be able to
practice outside. therefore opening up some
space for intramurals at this time.

Fairchild said she hoped all problems as
sociated with the annual practice space crunch
would be alleviated with the completion of the
new athletic center, which will have six prac-
tice spaces, not including the racquetball courts.
However, the new athletic center will not be
ﬁnished until graduation or later, too late to at:
rcct this year's teams.
