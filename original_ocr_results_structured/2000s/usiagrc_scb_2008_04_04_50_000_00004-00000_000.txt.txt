Sweeney Todd
(2007) ‘

Bloody good time with
singing, murdering barber

stationery Todd is a bloody good timcialitl
I do mean bloody.

Tim Burton has adapted Stephen Sont‘lr
heiin’s musical {or the screen, bringing just
enough of his characteristic style without
ovetdoing it.

The hair is extravagnnt, the blood splatters
are a garish red-orange, but he’s smart enough
to let the music and songwriting speak for
themselves,

Sweeney Todd (Johnny Depp) was once a
naive barber named Benjamin Barker. Falsely
convicted by the corrupt, lecherous Judge
Turpin (Alan Rickman), he was torn from his
lovely wife and daughter and transported to
Australia.

After 15 years away, he returns to London
with a new name and nothing but vengeance
on his mind.

Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter).
proprietor orthe pie shop below Sweeney's old
quarters, remembers him and happily takes
him in again, informing him that his wife rook
poison long ago and Judge Turpin is raising his
daughter Johanna in near isolation.

Mrs. Lovett fancies Sweeney, but he has
eyes only for his straight razors and the judge.
This subtle, onersided relationship provides
much oftl-ie ﬁlm's dark humor and depth.

There's a subplot concerning Johanna and
a sailor who befriended Sweeney on the voyage
to London, but it's not nearly as compelling.

While the plot lsjust an especially dark riff
on the standard revenge fantasy, the musical
numbers are the movie’s taison d'étte.

The choreography is understated but are
ting, the score fantastic and the lyrics devils
ishly clever.

“A Little Priest,” as Sweeney and Mrs.
Lovett discuss how to dispose of bodies, is
a wickedly fun highlight of the film, and
Sweeney’s bloodthirsty odes to revenge (“My
Friends” and "Epiphany") are guilty pleasures.

If you don't mind a little murder amongst
your song and dance, Sweeney ﬂuid is an en-
tertaining way to spend a couple ofhours. It’s
over the top, but has enough subtle touches to
keep the observant viewer laughing. And res
ally, can anyone get enough of johnny Depp?

Lavish production brings

Atonement might be one oftht: most fine»
ly crafted movies I have seen in the last six
months.

From start to ﬁnish, the creators of the
film have rendered the landscape, the charac-
ters, the music and the story to a degree both
opulent and easily approachable. Armenian/i
ﬁrst scenes in and around the English manor

Turner (James McAvoy) is tragically cut short
when Cecilia's sister Briony (Saoirse Ronan)
makes a shocking (and false) accusation. Brie
ony spends the rest of the movie (and her life)
coming to terms With the consequences of her
actions.

The ominous score, with the aid ota type-
writer as percussion (the movie was adapted
from a bestselling book), only heightens the
feeling that the characters are trapped in a
world ofdelieious foreboding. They are swept
along in the scope of the grand narrative,
which covers almost a l'mlf’Cenful'y in the life
of one girl (in three distinct parts), but never
seems like more cutsoutsr

I'm not really much of a fan of Knight
lt:y, but she gives a performance that at least
does not detract from the much stronger ones
from McAvoy and Ronan. McAuoy especially
deserves the praise he has received {or a rc-
strained pcrfutmance that shows most coin-
pletcly his character's disgust for all the factors
(class, wai, societal humiliation) that get in the
way of the true expression ofhis love.

one of the grand old dames ofBritish cinema,
dramatically changes the scope of the story
and helps to create an ending both unexpected
and entirely fitting to the emotions evoked in
the previous two hours.

It's a conclusion that. like the rest of the
movie, does not feel forced or sentimental or
pretentious.Aronnnmt runs on richly evoked
scenery and deeply felt emotion, but unlike
many of its genre, reels entirely real and enter-
taining while doing it.
