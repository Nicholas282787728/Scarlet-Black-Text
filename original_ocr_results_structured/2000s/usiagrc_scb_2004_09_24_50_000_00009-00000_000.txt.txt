Presenting Grinnell's ﬁnest Mexican food

I have been a Mexman cuisine enthusiast for as
long as r can remember. I wouldn'r exactly call myself
a connoisseur because my knowledge OfMeXlCLln food
does not extend beyond the fact thatI like it. Salsa,for
example, is my favorite and most flcqucntly used con-
diment I'll put salsa on most things, and the results
are often better than you’d expect. Rice and beans are
a perfect side dish combination, if you ask rnc. And
don’t get me started on anything “con qireso,"

anicdly, 1 really like eating Mexican food (yes,
yes,I reallyllke eating most things, butMexican food
really is high on my list.) And luckily, I've always had
friends with families that took amazing Mexican
meals and lived near restaurants that serve Mexican
food as it should be: authentic, tantalizing, spicy, de l’
clous.

Until I came to college, that is,

spot in my heart that had previously

Last year, I drove to Newton n
few times in order to visit the Gl‘lnnellﬂtnuwned La
Cabana Restaurant, known for being the only decent
Mexican food you can get ‘raund these parts.Thc rLs7
tauraot was about what I expccrLd—ti ne atmosphere,
fine service, fine food, but nothing to write home
about, It was definitely a step above the dining halls

Bill how, you may ask, was the food? Well, the

vegetables thrown LLL as Ln aftcttllought. It was
still tasty (as almost any salsa is,) but maybe we
were just so hungry from staring Lr rhe chips for
' so long that it didn‘t matter. I ordered the “chef's

sauteed with cilantro and other spices. It was
a little on the salty side, but I have :l strange
afﬁnity for salt, so I liked it. My dining
companion ordered an intense dish,

tortilla and dCCP‘fﬂtd, then covered in more cheese
and smothered in L creamy sauce. He seemed to enjoy
it. I didn’t dare try it, One the whole, the food was

It’s not amazing, but the food is comparable to La

some time on your hands.

My most sincere thanks

I am so glad that there’s ﬁnally a club on cani-
pus dedicated to taking my rights away. Why, just
the other day l was thinking to myself, ”Vou know
what sucks? All these nghtsI have. .who can keep
track of em?! I wish someone would get rid of some
of them, but who?” Luckily my prayers were an-
swered, and so I owe much thanks to you brave few
who work so hard to eliminate women's rights. It's a
refreshing dose of regression for which Gtinnell Col-
lege (and the whole country) was long overdue.
