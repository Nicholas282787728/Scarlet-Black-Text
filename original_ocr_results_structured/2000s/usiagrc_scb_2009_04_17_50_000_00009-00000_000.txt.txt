On Monday, Tuexday, and Wednesday went to Lion’s Den, Raébitt’x, Eaglex Club,
P/joenix, and 1/be Ham [aﬁnd nut tbe animal/lyric qualifies offbeyefine extaé/is/amenta, T/yzk i5 Meir tail:

‘ ' ' . ~- , . 1" Lion’s Den ”9%.!

The unassuming exterior ofthls roadside store belies the raunchy interior oflowa’s premier
adult superstore. As a business catering exclusively towards humans,we felt the Lion's Den
didn't have too mneh to offer for animals. However, the suspiciously “Lion King'uthemed
logo and a feature ﬁlm entitled “The Cougar Hunter" brought their animalist rating up
somewhat. That, and the Triple Pleasure Dolphin.

Phoen X ”GEM!

Nestled away on the corner of Paris and 4th, Cafe Phoenix emerged flan] the ashes of
owner Kamnl Hammouda’s previous restaurant, The Last Egyptian, From the locally
raised and cured meat to the cute little deereshaped porcelain salt and pepper shakers, this
restaurant's food and decor eould satisfy even the hungriest oft-casts.

 

Also winning points tot Café Phoenix were its various animal~rhcmcd drinks, such as
Goose Island beers and Lobo Loco wines,

Represented by the most noble ofbeasts, a bald eagle, the Fraternal Order ofrh: Eagles is
a eharitable organization rounded in 1892. Inside, a friendly officer gave us a personal tour
of the facilities. showing us the truly generous spirigofthe eagle. This impressive organi-
zation is responsible for a number of good deeds in the tornmunity, suth as provide tree
use of their function hall to people in need for events such as wakes and f\lndraiscrs.Th:
Eagles Club's selﬂess eomtnnnity service would malte any person or animal feel at home.
The walls on the basis room were also adorned With awesome paintings orbald eagles.

(2) Rabbitt’s ﬁﬂﬁm!

This longeestablished Grmnell watering hole is moving up the food ehain from a .nere
bar to an all-inclusive hangout zone, complete with drinks, smokes, and gyros, With an
name ofundiscloscd origin, the neon Budweiser pheasant hanging out on the wall invites
patrons into Rabbitt's, the perfect place fol all you pool sharks to hon: your skills.

With its wide array ofproducts and activities, Rabbitt's is the perfect place to indulge and
get in touch with your inner animal. But don’t get drunk as a slsunlt, because you might
ﬁnd youlself at the zoo, or at least behind bars at the local preeintt.

(3) Wolf Haus 996’.

Though not a commereial establishment, Wolf Haus, or 1015 High street, is a local bas-
tion ofanimaliry. With a pair of deer antlers lying in the from yard and 12 steaks in the
freezer, Wolf Hans immediately impressed upon us its true animal nature. The tesidents
noted that they frequently wear sweatshirts with wolves and deer on the front and once
had a PeriodicTable ofMal-nmals hanging on the Wall. Woeraus' name originated over a
hypothetical conversation in whieh residents jok:d that they should lseep a paek ofdogs in
the basement ofthc house to release in the ease ofunwanlcd guests. Fortunately for those
of us who wish to experience Wolf him for ourselves, the residents are in reality quite
weleoming of all guests, animal or otherwise, who may stop by.
