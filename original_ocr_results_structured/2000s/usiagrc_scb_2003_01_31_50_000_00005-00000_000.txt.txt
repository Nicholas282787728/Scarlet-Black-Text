The 8&8 talks with Bill Francis, Dirctor of Information Technology Services, about last weekend’s computer virus ’

Q: What's the virus called? Has it been
removed?
A: Slammer or Sapphire, and yes.

‘ a Q: Exactly what effect
' did it have on Gn'nnell’s
network?
A: Flooded both onrcarnpus
network and our connection to a
flooded Internet

0: Are personal machines at
. risk from the virus?
' A: Unlikely. A few pieces of personal
software could be infected, like MS-
Project.

0: Does it happen often?
r it happened last year a few times when we had
email problems.

0: Enough people around the world got this
virus that it made international headlines. Is

this a historically signiﬁcant event?

A: To show the magnitude: 200,000 machines, mostly
servers, second largest global attack ever, veny fast. It took
only ﬁfteen minutes from inception to Grinnell’s infection.

0: Will viruses continue to damage the
internet periodically, or are the techies of the
world getting better at dealing with them?

A: Techies are getting better but this will continue since
hackers are smart techies tour

0: We heard that networks would have been
immune to the virus if everybody had
downloaded a particular update to the
software that the virus exploited. If that's
true, why didn’t Grinnell have an updated
version?

A: Variety of reasons. For example, some (non-

Microsoft) vendors that use the Microsoft 50L or Microsoft
SQL DE as one of the underlying pieces in their software
applications have not certified their applications to work
with the latest (patched) versions of sql or SQL pr.
Another problem: some software vendors have embedded
SClL DE in the server applications and there is no indication
of this when you purchase, install, use/manage or look at
the documentation for the application. The first indication
of the presence of the MS piece for dozens of products was
the virus infection itself. Surprise! Finally, the MS patch
does not work as slick as MS suggests. in some cases the
software vendor has to give personal assistance to the user
for the MS patch to install.

0:15 there anything users can do to help
prevent viruses from spreading?

A: set their Windows 2000 and Windows XP machines to
auto-update security software from the web.
