Russian mobsters and English spies, oh my

Eastern Prom-
ises (2007)

Strong acting adds to com—
plex character-driven film

Ear/em Prolmiel is a fascinating combinae
tion: it appears too quiet for a thriller, and yet
violence fuels every character, breaks through
at any moment and masks surprisingly dcnse
thematic layers. At times the emotional cons
nection we have with the characters can seem
tenuous, but the movie holds true to its me?
sage of ﬁnding identity.

The movie delivers this message in two
ways, The first is through Anna’s (Naomi
Watts) unsettling discovery of the inner workv
ings of the Russian mob in London through
a diary found on one ofrheir victims. Her ins
volvemerrt draws her closer to Nikolai (Viggo
Mortensen), ii driver for the mob boss’s son
who is working his very up through the organiv
zation. The mob, as seen through Anna's eyes,
becomes startlingly and frighteningly real as
the brutality behind organized crime explodes
across the screen.Tlris is the movie at its most
alluring: when people and situations change
from innocent to inescapably dangerous and
the close presence ofcvil in the world becomes
all the more apparent.

The evolution of character intent contrib-
utes also to how the movie builds its message.
It is less Clear to the viewer, as both affection
and brutality reveal themselves unexpectedly
in characters previously straightforward in
their motivation. Unfortunately, the often du-
plicitous motivations leave a trail difﬁcult to
follow, and affection is lost for characters we
can’t frilly understand. Even with this prob»
lem, the characters never fail to bc compelling,
thanks to stellar performances. Mortenscn is
particularly frightening in his committed por—
trayal of a Russian mobster, and Watts carries
her characters complicated background with
an endearing grace.

While many themes run through Barrera
Prami'rer, like familial duty, justice, hope, and
history, the movie carries all of them with a
subtle and thoroughly satisfying balance. Its
power lies within its depth, and the slow rev-
elations so quietly orchestrated in such an un-
forgiving world.

Bond spoof amuses

but confuses

What would you say ifl told you there is
a James Bond movie featuring such film 1w
minaries as Peter Sellers, David Niven, Orson
Welles and Woody Allen? Youd probably say
somerhing like “You must be joking!" And
you'd be rrghr. The movie in question is the
1967 version of Carina Raye/c and it very difr
ferent film than the solemn and intense Dans
iel Craig affair of 2006. Rather than a canon
Bond ﬂick, the earlier movie is a spoof of the
genre,

Viggii Mar/mien, N/wml Walla mid/t lent: elimiulm in Eastern Promises.

CminaRayrI/t' finds the originaljames Bond
(Niven) brought our ofretiremerrt in order to
stop the evil organization SMERSH, which is
killing the secret agents ofall the major world
powers, in order to confuse the enemy Bond
recruits even more “James Bonds," including
master Baccarat player Evelyn Tremble (Sell-
ers), in order to bankrupt SMERSH agent Le
Chiffre (Welles).

In addition to confusing SMERSH, Cam
Jim Royals also confuses rhe vieweL so dif-
ferent directors worked on the film during its
troubled production, resulting in an almost
episodic format with dramatically various die
rectron styles. The story feels pieced together
and chaotic. since the movie is very much a
parody and really not meant to be a storyr
driven pieee, this is somewhat forgivable. But
a few ofrhe segments are so surreal that they
appear to come out of nowhere, and it is only
because you’re seeing the same actors that sug
gests you're watching the same movie.

Thankfully, the movie proves to be genus
inely funny it's stuffed with sight gags and the
sort of verbal d ’rity that makes you either
groan in disbelicfor slap your knee in a fit of
laughter. Much to my delight. there wcrc even
a few absolutely terrible puns thrown into the
mix, Are these comedic clemcnrs enough to
overcome the bizarre plot structure? No, but
they defrnitely soften the blow a great deal.

Resident Evil
(2 007)

Expect a video game: you
won’t be too disappointed

Ever since the guys working at Taco John’s
recommended Resident E1)”, Extimtimz, I was
sure that seeing it would infuse my life with
fresh meaning and inspiration, Alas, the film
turned out to be far less intriguing and stimu-
lating than a potatoes 016 .To be fair, potatoes
016 are extremely inn-igu' and stimulating,
and the min is based on a vi :0 game or more
accurately, is a video game

I don't think any Video game is exhilarating
in itself. The act of defeating a difﬁcult level,
or crushing your cocky friends spirits can be
sublimely exciting. But simply moving your
way through a digital world is fun and exciting
the way surfing the web is: you're never really
that entertained or fulﬁlled, but for some con—
founding reason, you keep going watching

until brain functions settle into a pleasant
rhythm, a lazy hum. Watching Milla Jovovich
kick zombie ass has a similar effect. The film
skimmed over my consciousness, failing to stir
any real emotions, but keeping my attention
with an inside our dog here and a crotch close
up there,

The movie is set on Earth, where a devar
raring virus has converted all animal life into
rabid zombies,Thcrc are some survivors, who
roam about the lifeless desert with the primary
purpose of not getting eaten. Alice (Jovovieh)
is a genetically enhanced chick whose hlood
Contains the antidote to the virus. We watch
her kill zombies, arch lrer eyebrows seductively,
and elude an evil corporation intent on using
her blood to create an antidote.

Perhaps thrs film, in creating a parallel be
tween the Zombies and the corporatron, rs tryr
ing to comment on the universally destructive
nature of greed. On second thought, I would
be more inclined to read the Teletubbics as a
NIarxist allegory, Rm‘limll Evil: Exliiltrirll is
dumb,plain and simple Accepting this fact off
the bat is crucial to enjoying the film. If you
look for sound acring, you’ll only find Ashanti
and Mike Epps flirting so poorly it seems srre
castrc. tryou listen for a suitable score, you'll
only hear the same mintbnnmhing video game
music. But rfyou turn you higher brain off, and
ler rhc action sequences and slrek visuals tickle
your senses, you may walk away with a feeling
other than regret.
