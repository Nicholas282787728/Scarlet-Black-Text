The three men competing to be l>owcsluck
County’s next slictiffdldn't get as much attention li’l5(
week as the candidates for State Reprcsclitntivc, but
their exchanges during the 90-minute League of
Women Voters torum brought their opinions on law
enrorcomcnr in the county inru sharp teens. The de-
bate focused on drug enrorcemcm, ihe state or the
counry jail, and allegations or past r.usmr agemcnt
ofthc sheriff’s ofﬁce .

Tom Kricgcl is the Democratic nominee. Toni
Sheets the Republican. Marty Dllffus elected to run
for the office as an independent after he lost Ill: Re
publ primary to Sheets last June.

At ast week's toriun, no candidate emerged as
dmmatimlly more qunllflcd than the others The three
men have over so years or law enforcement cxpcii»
ence between them, his clear that they all possess, at
least on paper, the crcdcntisls necessary to be sherirr.
Conscqucntly, discussion ccniered on the candidates
views or past ariminisriarions, and what tlicy'tlicm-
sci 5 would do with the OlTICC,

while all thi cdmlidnmngrecd on the need for strong
drug catorcemenr, Durrus said he would assign one
or the deputy circuits to work solely on drug cases.
Neither oihis opponents thought that was necessary,
preferring instead to have drug enroiccment handled
by the entire department.

Duitus talked about his mle in sctring up the
laxpcr-l‘owcxltick Drug rash Force, while Krisgcl
emphasized his ability to bring together local police
departments from Grinncll, Brooklyn, Montezuma.
and othct towns. “That's where I think I have an
advantage, because l'vc worked closely with all or
them," Kriogcl said.

Duirus and ins opponents also disagreod on how
big the new county iail should be, with Dnrrus advo-
cating a very large building ”W: neecl to build a {as
cility that is large enough to hold more than what we
absolutely liccd," he said. He proposed construcring
a prison with 40 or 50 beds, instead of the 25 bed:

recommended by consultants, and renting space out
to other counties to hclp pay tor the tacihty.

Kricgel was skeptical “Do we want to pimp tram
scvcn lbedsl to 502" he asked. “we know how hard it
is to sell a school bond lror funding] in this county.
can you imagine how hard it will be to sell a jail
bond?”

Sheets also seemed disinclined to build a large
raeiliry “I'd like to see some kind or committee
termed" to look at what thc county nccds, he said.
“l'cl like to look at all the options available and not
dedicate mysslrto just one option."

Both Sheets and Kricgcl indicated they would

that to do so would be irresponsible.

Durrus said that he had wanted to run forshcriff

Sheers said he belieycs the sheritrs ofﬁce has good
people, and simply needs good leadership. He prom.
ised to provide that leadership.

Knegel, who also ran for the mm in 1996, closed
by promising to be an industrious leader. “Folks, l
promise I’ll work hard for you," he said.

Controversy in the sheriff’s race

The three-way race for Sheriff
has turned into a kind of circus in
the final days of the campaign.
with independent candidate Marty
Duffus engaging in a public feud
with the current holder of that
ofﬁce, in the pages of the
Grinnell Heralchegister.

The HeraldrRegistel’s lead
story on Monday concerned
Democratic candidate Toni
Kncgel's criticism of the way the
sheriff’s ofﬁce handled a 1999
marijuana investigation.
According to acting Sheriff Tom
Law, a farmer from Searsboro
came to the sheriff's ofﬁce in
November 1999 and told Deputy
Tom Sheets that he suspected
someone was growing marijuana
on nearby land. Sheets found
some 500 marijuana plants, which
were then destroyed.

Duffus, who was chief deputy
under former Sheriff John Grifﬁn,
apparently took over the case
from Sheets, but no further action
was taken. When Law took over
after Griffin’s resignation, he
asked Duffus to contact county
attorney Mike Mahaffey to try and

_close the case. when Duffus did

not, law said, he asked Duffus to
hand over all the maten'al he had
on the case. Duffus complied.

In the candidates' forum last
week, Kriegel alleged that
inaction on the case resulted in
Poweshiek County losing about
$40,000 in forfeiture fees.

Duffus, in response to the
Herald—Registrar’s questions, said

he did not comment on the case
because it would be "unethical
and unprofessional.” He accused
Law of playing politics, trying to
discredit him just before the
election.

"I am deeply saddened that
county politics, especially a
sheriff's race, has sunk to this
level," Duffus told the Herald-
Register

The same issue included a
letter from Law, unrelated to the
drug case, in which the current
sheriff said that Duffus, in his
interview with the Herald-
Register, ”seemed to belittle what
we [Law and chief deputy Larry
Wray] have accomplished in our
short term as interim sheriff and
chief deputy of Poweshiek
County."

Law wrote that while he
intended to stay neutral in the
race, he wanted to defend his
record. He criticized the previous
administration, and Duffus by
association, on a number of
issues ranging from weapons
policy to accounting for drugrbuy
money.

this spat between the current
sheriff and one of men seeking
the position, carn'ed out in such a
public arena, promises to add an
interesting twist to next Tuesday's
election. How the feud will affect
the election, or indeed the future
of law enforcement in Foweshiek
County, remains to be seen.

Making the choice

Students try to decide between Gore and Nader for tomorrow’s potentially tight presidential race

Back in August, when he addressed the Democratic Cons

Later on, the Campus Democrats used Hattkin’s line in 1|
poster But it wasn’t long before one sign, in the north campus
loggia, was slightly altered. Someone scribbled out the word
“Democrat" and replaced it with “Green Party." And next to
“Republican" wcrc the words “or
Democrat... same difference."
The third-Party candidacy of Ralph
Nader has driven u wedge into the
liberal community, here it! Grinnell

Nader supporters argue thar although their party designa—

that it doesn’t really matter who’s in the White House," said
Matt Ewing '02, a member of Free the Planet.

Ewing conceded that Gore has a stronger record ofenvir
ronmcntal protection than Bush, but said that “regardless of
who's in me White House, were going to have to work really
hard to makc sure the environment is protected,"

A Nader supporter in 1996, Dcnveller wrote that he will
deﬁnitely cast his ballot for Gore this year.

Many liberal voters, however, ﬁnd
themselves torn between a candidate

and one who has nochaneo orwmaing.
Ralph Nader likes to call it voriag your
rears versus voring your hopes. others
call it voring with your head as opposed
ro your heart.

Mair couch ‘03. is one such voter.
Although Nader‘s candidacy appeals to
his idcalism, he is also sensitive to the
value for liberals orhaving a Democrat
in the White House for the next four years.

Congress might be behind the party's shirt toward the center.
IfAJ Gore wins the presidency and Democrats rcgain power in

“Despite the similarirics between the two parties, and pal»
ticularly the two candidates, the Democratic party is still a cen.
teralert parry." Couch said

couch feels the Green Party's strongest argument is that
the time to build a viable third party is now. “It would provid:
an alternative to the system that at lcast 50 percent ofrh: popu»
larlon doesn’t have any desire to participate in," he said. “If
rhcre was a Green Party, then more people. particularly young
people, people orour generation, would get involved in poll»

A number orcommeatators who sympathize with Nader

Whether Gore wins or losrs. whether or not Nader gets
