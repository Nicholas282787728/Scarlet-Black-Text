the scarlet and black

April 22 2005

What's behind that veil?

Lasr Friday nighr I was ar a presparty for the annual “Mary B,
James" crosSsdressing party, checking our all the lovely attue. Men
wore bras, lipstick and tight~fitting skirts; women wore suspenders,
loose clothing and ties. We were showing that gender is socially con»
structed, we were making fun ofbeauty iiorms,wc were dancing.

My heart skipped a bear when rwo srudenrs walked into the party,
One of the students were a gauzy veil across his face, and was draped
With cloth from head to toe; the other wore a kcichief tied with
string around her head. In other words, they
were wearing inurauons ofrhe burqua worn by
some Muslim women, and the head covering
worn by some Arab men. I watched as other
partygoers congiatulated them on their inven-
tive outfits. I walked out of the party, walked
back in. I approachcd the students. “Excuse mc,"l said. “Are you
making some kind ofpolitical statement?"

The students replied that they hiid dressed this wayjust for fun,
with no political purpose. They had checked with friends before
donning the attire, and it had been approved. “1 am Turkisli Ameri-
can, and l have re tell you rhar I don't think it's ﬂinny. especially
in light of the current antirMiddle Eastern political climate ofthe
United States,"1said. I told them that they were free to wear what-
ever rhey wanted, but I was obliged to communicate my negative
response to their outfits.

They were polite, and the veiled one even said “thanks for tells
ing us instead of yelling at us." I saw them milling about in their
stereotype—reinforcing garb over the next half hour. I thought I saw
that one of them had changed clothing as I was leaving the party,
but may be misraken. Regardless, 1 want ro give rhese two students,
as well as friends who did not understand why their outfits put me
off, an explanation.

My erhniciry is not what caused me to rake offense to rhe outfits.
Nor is my religioniln fact, 1 am not religious and was raised to
despise Islamic fundamentalism am concerned, as is any politically
conscious resident of the U.S., about widespread Western misinfor-
mation about Islamic practice. The myth of the “Muslim World"
perpetuates a false stereotype of homogeneity about countries with
diverse religions, governments, languages and cultures. The current
administration is using the “Muslim World” stereotype and the im-
ages that convey it in order to jusrrfy arracks on Middle Eastern
people both domestically and internationally

This stereotype includes the fetishization of “the veil" worn by
some Muslim women. “The veil” has come to inaccurately symbol-
ize many things in the Western mind. This was evident in the writ-

Reconciling

Since joining Grinnell‘s community, I have been tempted to
write a letter to the editor a number of rimcs by various debates or
clashes of personalities on campus, bur 1 generally saw a voice of
reason that expressed more articulately than I could what I wanted
to say. However, now I see two extreme camps Without a voice for
people feeling pulled between the rwo.

First, I want to address the administration’s action against Paul
wainright ‘07, and in particular Katy Bowen no and Denise Flores
‘OS‘s letter to the editor supporting the administration’s actions and
Paul's arrest.

I should initially say that I do not fault
the student or students (so called ‘rats’ or
‘narcs’) who reported Wainright's post. I
think it is too much to ask a student to cons
front another student they are legitimately
frightened of in the name of self~govcr~
nance. After all,we live in a community full of non-confrontational
introverts, inyselfiiicludcd.

Sclfsgovcrnancc is not abour confronrariou, bur accepting per
sonal responsibility, It is part of the administiation’s job to solve
student concerns where self-governance can't, especially when a stu—
dent dues not feel safe.

With rhis in mind. I vehemently disagree With Bowen and
Florcs’ claim that the administration was in a “liarwin situation." I
think there is a lot of middle ground between ignoring a student’s
concern and turning a student in to the police. While I think it is
too much to ask .\ student to confront another stlldcnt,l think the
college iidiiiiiiistratioii is in an excellent position to do so.

The administration could have called Paul, Paul's patents, Paul's
friends, or even Paul's passing acquaintances; all of whom would
verify his “threatening communication" was satiric and not at all an
actual threat. I'm sure the administration could have come up with
a variety ofother solurions more reasonable than turning Paul in re
the police, but instead I believe they acted rashly.

Further, i become very defensive when I'm told to “stop using
the free-speech card," i don’t think a police force should ever act
preernprively when u infringes on someones constirurionally pips
tected rights. Denise and Flores’ reasoning to do so is the same
reasoning that was used to pass the more egregiously offensive parts
of the Patriot Act.

Letters to

ings of Chrisrian American women missionaries visiring Middle
Eastern countries to “liberate” their “poor sisters" behind the veil,
as it is in modern rhetoric surrounding what some Americans took
to be a moral imperative to invade Afghanistan and Iraq in order to
“liberate” the women oppressed by the “evil Islam."

President Bush's “War on Terror" has heighrened propaganda
caricaturizing Middle Eastern women as submissive veiled creatures
to be pitied, and Middle Eastern men as ieligious fanatics and ter—
rorists.The Bush regime uses these stereotypes tojusrify
wars in Afghanisran and Iraq to the American public.

Domesrically, the anrirMiddlc Eastern stereotypes
cloak civil liberties violations. Last week, two sixteens
yearrold girls were arrested and detained with no law-
yers and no evidence rhrt they were, as alleged, ti“thrcat
to national security.”The Mary BJamcs outfits ofthc two students
too closely mirrored ethnocentrrc caricatures used to excuse vior
lcnce.

Growing up in America, 1 know that having honest discussions
of freedom and human rights is more difﬁcult for Americans than
the popular media retrain “War on Terror" lets on. Ar Grinnell Cola
legc, it is easy to tell a man his lipstick shade reminds me ofsprings
time. It is hard to tell a man his veil reminds me ofpatriots prepar—
ing for war.

At a basic level, one must question the rcplicarion of an im
age stereotypically associated wirh a racial or ethnic group for the
purpose ofbeing funny. Religious fundamentalism is a terrible re-
pressive force in many parts of the world, and changes in degree of
freedom or repression in many countries are symbolically signified
by changes in dress.

From my own experience studying at a university in Turkey last
semester,I know the power ofdtess as a symbol offreedom. I learned
about a legal shift to modern dress during formation of the Turk-
ish Republic, and heard debates about whether to continue banning
headscarves ar public universiries as part of the separation of relis
gion from rhe secular State of'rurkey. A few Muslim women were
headscarves to our classes as part ofsparking a discourse around hu-
man rights. In contrast, in Iran, a country under religious rule,some
women fight against the obligatory coverings in public space.

What is a form of political protest in one place becomes some—
thing very different in another context. The eﬂ’ect of non-Muslim
students wearing imitations oflslamic coverings to a costume party
in rhe Unired stares seems analogous to that otwhire actors per-
forming in blackface. Please, let us know the histories of the images
we replicate.

differences

Again, I think rhere was middle ground the police could and
should have taken before arresting Paul. I think it is pretty clear
they didn’t investigate the situation any further than reading the
“threatening communication." An arrest based on poor information
is a damned poor arrest.

Second,l think the outward tone of the campus reaction to
Wainright's arrest, and in particular the tone of the group [solid], is
counter—productive.

First,I concede that [Solid] is full ofindividuals making (not alv
ways good) individual decisions. With rhis
is in mind, I think [solid] can still be held
accountable for the way it presenrs irself ro
the campus. For example, putting up post
ers that imply you’ll kill ‘rats’ and drawing
parallels to WWII propaganda is hardly a
way ro sell yourselfas the voice ofreason.

Ifyou want the administration to start taking students and Stur
dent’s concerns seriously, setting as at odds as opponents against
them is far from the best way to accomplish this. Also, the tone of
the “ask me about" protesr, with unitorrn, grunge-inspired t-shirts
seemed militant and hostile from an outsiders perspecrive, which
serves to weaken the gioup’s message.

I think the group [solid] can create something positive, and I
think it already has in creating a forum for students to vent and
discuss, butl think that the outward image and tone the group has
chosen will alienate moderate students and keep the administration
wary.

1 encourage [Solid] to work closely with the SGA, out already
established voice to the administration, in order to strengthen SGA‘s
legrtimacyanti power through actual studcnt inpur. 1 also encourage
[Solid] to keep in mind that the student body isn't uniﬁed voice
that can be rallied with ﬁsts iaised against the admin ration, but
rather a diverse group with diverse opinions and sensibilities.

On the other sidc,1 cncoiiragc rhc adiniiiisrration not to think
ofus as a hostile force that you need to defend againsr. We are in so
many ways atyoui mercy, and I encourage you not to abuse that fact,
bur rarher to lisren, and more importantly to care.

I am open to cvcryonc’s input to help better inform niy opin—
ions,
