Making the
ballot

SGA student services coordina-

tor rejects 'rant’ initiative
BY LoLA GARCIA

This Thursday, students voted on four student
in iatives, a referendum and a constitutional amend-
merit.

The voting officially ended Thursday night at
midnight, and results were released shortly thereafe
ter.

At least fifty percent of the student body must
turn out to vote and each initiative needs rwtrthirds
approval to pass.The referendum is nonebinding and
is meant merely to estimate student support.The con-
stitutional amendment requires fifty percent turnout
with sixty percent approtml.

The laundry referendum was initially publicized
as an initiative. At Wednesday's Joint Board, Treat
suret Matt Cleiilman ‘06 clariﬁed that it was actually
a nonbinding referendum, He said that the primary
aim was to determine student opinion as to whether
the laundry system should be included at a fee paid at
the beginning of the semester and allowing an allot-
ted number of
wash and dry
loads. The
new system
would replace
the current
paysassyous
go system.

A n d r e s
Chang ‘05 and Wesley Beary ‘05 submitted a ﬁfth
initiative, but Student Services Coordinator Drcw
Blackmail ‘05 refused to put it on the ballot. The im-
tintive, which is three singleespaced pages long, is a
series of grievances against SGA, Gruuiell college
administrators, film projectionists, Vice President of
Student Affairs Tom Crady, trustees, students’ par—
ents, students on cell phones and others
. The students first submitted the initiative shortly
after midnight on the morning ofWednesday, April
13. Blackmail responded an hour and halflater, stats
ing that the initiative was not eligible to voted on and
would not be included on the ballot. Blackman sug»
gested several revisions to the "statement" and “plan
of action" portions. According to the email, unless all
revisions were made the initiative would not be ac~
cepted. The deadline for submitting initiatives was
noon on Wednesday.

According to the SGA Constitution, student init
tiatives must be submitted to and reviewed by the
Student Services Cooidinatot and the coordinator
can offer recommendations. The Constitution also
requires that initiatives receive 100 student signatures
to appear on the ballot.The student Services coordie
nator is given the power “to review all proposals seeke
ing passage through the student initiative system.”
The constitution does not give the Student Services
Coordinator the power to exclude initiatives hour the
ballot and states that all recommendations given to
the sponsor are “nonbinding unless absolutely neces
sary to fit the proposal into an actionable form."

“I was determined to cooperate," said Chang, who
wrote the bulk ofthe initiative. He said he removed
cxpletives and omitted items Blackmail had deemed
offensive and untrue. The recommendations with
which he did not comply included written justifica~
tions, and Chang offered to include a disclaimer. At
3:20 that afternoon Blackman emailed Chang to in-
form him that his initiative would not appcar on the
ballot.

“My reaction was one of surprise because 1 had

Hoofin’ it hardcore

av MARGARET TOOMEY

Last Saturday morning, despite threatening clouds
and occasional drizzles, 286 participants gathered at
Merrill Park for the Hoofin' It 5K Run/Walk. Run-
ners and walkers registered, socialized and warmed up
until shortly after 10 a.m., when George Drake so,
history, rang a cowbell to start the race.

Some participants ran the course pushing stroll-
ers, while some powerwalked with fitness walking
poles, Track team members ran the
3.1 mile course just northwest of
the college instead of their regular
workout, while others walked at a
leisurely pace,

Mortar Board, members Lisa

the event to raise money for Heifer
International and lVIIdTIUWil COITIT
munity Action (MICA). Heifer international gives
sustainable gifts oflivestockto communities i’l‘llollglr
out the world, and MICA provides goods, food and
services to underprivileged iriiuilies in Giiiinell and
the surrounding area

The three organizers began working at the bcguie
ning of the spring semestei to prepare for the event:
getting permission fiom the city of Giiiiiicll and
Poweshielc County, purchasing insuiante, gathering
prizes from local businesses, making t-shii-ts and go-
ing dooretoedoor along the coursc to notify rcsidcuts
ofthe race. They publicized the event in church bule
letins and campus publications, on KGRN and iii
sidewalk chalk around campus.

The event raised over $8,600,iiic1uding registra-
tion fees, a $750 donation from President Russell

grant from the Alirens Foundation. Local businesses
donated over 51,000 in “straight up money and gift
certiﬁcates and donations of goods for race prizes,"
said Neidergeses,

After the race, participants hung out at Merrill
Park, Listening to the Too Many Strings Band and
snacking until the winners were announced and prizt
es given away.

The organizers also hoped
the event would promote fitness
and foster positive towuegowit
relations. About 150 college stun
dents and about 120 other Grin-
ricllians completed the course,
according to Ncidcrgescs.

some time off, and i ﬁgured the race was a good way
to pinpoint my junipingeofi' point," were Hughey “I
liked the cause as well.”

The three organizers expressed hope that the
Hoofin’ll SK would become an annual Moitar Board
event, “The most touching moment for me was not
the lace at all but the next day,” said Nicdergeses via
email. “1 talked to an oldei woman (who had ostcot
arthritis and a handicapped sticker for her car) who
said that she was so proud to finish that she was go-
ing to hang thc racc number on her wall, and that her
children will have to sec her differently, I wanted to
empower people in this community and I hope that
that is what we did."
