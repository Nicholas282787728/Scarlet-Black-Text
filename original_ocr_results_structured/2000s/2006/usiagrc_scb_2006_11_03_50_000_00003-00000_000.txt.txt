Students face issues old and new

sv CHLOE MORVL

Every semester, student initiatives put a motley assortment
ofchuracters and issues before the student body for its approval,
This year's unusually large batch of 15 initiatives includes the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Wedge Antilles and another call for
a boycott orcoca-cola products.

The many initiatives surprised SGA Student Services Co-
ordinator Julie Edwards '08. “Fifteen initiatives is a large numr
bet compared to years past where there have only been five or
10," Edwards said. l‘A lot ofthe ideas are also really tangible."

The initiatives this year have a wide range of goals. one
common theme is a call for changes in Dining Scrviccs. out of
concern that diners with allergies could suffer reactions from
dining hall food, one initiative asked Dining Services to label
all ingredients.

Another initiative asks the school to hire a nutritionist.
“While this may be difﬁcult to accomplish
because it creates an entirely new position,
it would beneﬁt students in many different
ways,” said Edwards. If passed, the nutritionist
could advise dining services on ways to make
dining hall food healthier, as well as counsel
students with eating disordcrs, and liclp atht
letes plan diets to enhance their performance.

Nora Skelly ’08 sponsored the nutritionist
initiative.“Wc have support staff for every othei aspect of cltmr
pus life, including academics, athletics, the health center, really
great reference librarians,m Skelly said. “I think ' ' 'mportant
to remember that our sustainable physical health is just as im-
portant as any of those things and we currently dont have any
support for that speciﬁc part ofstudcnt life.”

As in previous elections, students are faced with a call to
boycott Coca-Cola products on campus. Activists want to plesr
sure Coca-Cola to address labor problems in Colombia and
environmental complaints in India. Vthn students ﬁrst faced
a boycott initiative in spring 2005. they approved it, but the
measure narrowly failed the next semester.

Edwards said campaigns against CocatCola had reached
students. “This initiative has had a lot of success in the past,"
Edwards said. "Students are now more aware of the human
rights violations with large companies. The question is now
more whctlicr or not students are willing to stop drinking
Coke."

Ben Colin ‘08 and I’lelily Reich ‘09 sponsored the ﬁlial (lint
itig initiativc. It calls on the college to improve the offelings of
rho OtlzTnkcs service to the level students previously enjoyed

”I think it’s a lesidmenl in
student mil/olives that we have
Our lakes dial ”

with Grab 8c Go.

“I think it’s a testament to student initiatives that we have
Our Takes at all,l don’t think we would have that without the
initiative last year." Cohn said, Students overwhelmingly ap-
proved an initiative last winter asking to keep Grab 8c Go in
the Campus Center, and the new out Takes program was in
troduccd. “I think the next stcp is to try to improve OutTakes,
to get it back to how Crab and Go used to be, and better,“
Cohn sa’

Other i natives address academic issues. Laura Cathay '09
wants the college to reinstate the Africana Studies concentrar
tion eliminated in 2005. Students will also be able to endorse
the request by Solcil Ho '09 for the college to keep lists ofin-
dependent majors, whose specialties are currently quickly for-
gotren. “nght now, there are really no solid resources or prior
knowledge ofwhat independent majors have been in the past,"
Edwalds 'said. “This initiative would get
that knowledge out and make it more
feasible for students to have independent
majors,"

The Grinnell Students in Solidarity
with Israel and the Palestinian Solidarity
Group put aside theil differences to m,
sponsor an initiative asking for classes adr
dressing tiu» Israeli-Palestinian Conﬂict.

On a more comedic note, one initiative calls for Star Wars
cliitlitctcl Wedge Antillcsiol'tcn featured as a writcrin can-
didate in SGA elections—to be mlnslillcd as the General of
Grinncll College. “There’s always at lease one amusing initiar
(lVC I'm not sure what the obsession with Wedge Antilles is,
though,"sald Edwards,

Other initiatives iilcludc extending hours in the Fitness
Center, putting convocations back in Herrick Chapel, and
clarifying the policy on independent student travel to ﬁeld trips
and sports events.

For an initiative to pass, 50% ofthr student body has to cast
it votc, and from that two-thirds of the votels have to vote in
favor for the initiative to p. .Onc otthc big problems SGA
faces with initiatives is getting students to vote. “We want peo-
plc to vote,” said Edwartls,“Thcse are issues that arc important
to Grinnellians.’Y

snidcnts can vote on Pioneechb on Monday, Nov 6 from
12 a.ni. to 11:59 pm. computers will be available outside of
the dining hall during lunch and dinner during the day for 5hr
dents to vote,
