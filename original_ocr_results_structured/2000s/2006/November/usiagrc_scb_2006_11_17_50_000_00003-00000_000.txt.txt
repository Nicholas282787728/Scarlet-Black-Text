Yes, I am very pleased. I dont think it
could have gone much better than it did.
I think that GrinneIl smdcms made a big
difference in contributing to this clcction.
A lot of kids spent a lot of time and they
did a fantastic job to make a lag difference

throughout the area, here in town and in towns ilcross the
county. Grinnell students made a real, concrete impact to affect

the lives orowans and all Americans.

I guess just try to contribute as much
as you can while you‘re in school and then
there should just be opportunities available
to you in a lot of places. especially with the caucuses [and] the
2003 elections. Just apply for jobs,

Poster vandalism raises free speech questions

Posters, cant. from p. l

inson '09 said. “We ﬁnally had physical proof;
we had these signs that had ‘fag’ written all
over them,"

Vice President for Student Services Tom
crady said students should report such incir
dents directly to Security

“With seirgovetnance, we want students

,. to approach one another in a respectful
fashion," Crady said. “Where [administrators]
get involved is when there's something that
crosses the line into a hate crime or into an
incident ofharnssment."

According to Robinson, QPOC reported
the defaced posters to Security but has yet to

respectful and hateful,"
said SOL leader Melina
Rivera ’07. “It was not just
as if they were drunk."

on March 6, 2005,
wastikas were drawn on
South Campus posters,
us well as a Lazier bath
room, NoIIen House and

off campus, sparking a 250-person anti-hate

In Sept. 2004, posters for a new proelife
group were vandalized and torn down.

Other campuses have also struggled with
free speech questions, including an incident at
Columbia University in October.

In regard to many of these incidents, stu-
dent debate centered on questions of tree
speech. The Coalition of AntirRacist Whites
(CARW), a corsponsor of Muscio’s visit,
hopes to address the issue further in an ups
coming open forum.

“Free speech is the right to say what you
need to and the responsibility to think about
what you say publicly,” CARW caricadct Sal“
ah Lu '07 said, “but it is also the responsibility
to respond in a dialogue ifyou disagree."
