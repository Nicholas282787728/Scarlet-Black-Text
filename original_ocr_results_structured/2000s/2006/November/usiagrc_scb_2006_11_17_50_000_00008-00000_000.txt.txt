Administration must fully fund service

the number or college student vol- .

the number tllree years before

support {or community service. Grin—
nell's community service budget has
come up short by about 510,000, and
the college has not stepped forward to
cover the COSL

A $10,000 shortfall, the cost of a
pane of glass in the JRC, is signiﬁcant
enough to pre—
vent students
from aiding oth—
ers, but is little

scheme of the

94 percent of
students slip-

college to increase its community SCI"
vice funding, but as them has been no
response from administrators.

Previously, community service re»
ceived this money from designated gifts
from alums and other dollars. But now,
in an effort to increase overall donations,

alumni relations is soliciting more nu-
rcstricted donations, discouraging gifts
to speciﬁc groups, like Alt Break.

in last weeks 5513, Tom Crady
argued that the money would have to
come out oi another college program,
pointing to mental health services as
one potential source.
But neither of these
twoptogtams should
lie considered as
possible casualties?
instead, there should
be money coming
from elsewhere to
fund the program.

Both melltallleirlzh and community
service should be high prior-rues for the

Honestly, irony holds our generation back

in this column, I try to be completely holiest. It’ s
easy ellougll nor to lie, sure. All you need to do is not
say anything you know lsnt true. But to say what you
actually bellCV67illiii can be harder than it looks,

I thought I'd start this column by telling some
sneerrng, rronie anecdote about how nobody believes
anything anymore and we’re all so cynical we don’t
even believe in not belicv~
ingl ivordcd rhnropening
because it felt dishonest

But that brings me to
the somewhat morall'r
illg point of this column,
I rhink rhar our genera-
tion of Americans finds
it hard to be honest. We
may hold opinions about
the world. We may go to church, We may write pr
pers with actual rllcses and arguments. But when it
gets down to it,wc have a really hard time believingin
things, or- at least honestly telling other people about
die things we believc,The problem,l rhink, is that our
generation is so totally ironic.

But our irony makes it almost impossible to all-
swer the moral questions that life will call lls to an-
swcr again and again. I'm rnlking about those (our
inrrhcrmorning questions. chrcstions I feel a little bit
embarrassed to ask in print,

Like: Why are we here? How am 1 going to be
a good person to my friends and ramilyi Why .m I
miserable? Arc my actions really good.> Tire type or
questions I might wince or in saw a clmracrcr on a
prime time drama ask them aloud

To answer these qucslions,1 believe we need to be
utterly honest with ourselves. But we’re a very media
savty generation. We know all the tricks, all the girli—

micks. We don’t fall for all that crap about ﬁnding
yourselfand personal growth.

I overheard one sopllomorlc Grrnrrcllirn muse:
"What do pcoplc mean when they say bc honosr with
voutselP We're all just socially constructed lr we,
indeed, think that our souls are socially constructed,
that we lnusr answer the big questions with a witty
barb and a shrug and a
swig of Mountain Dcw,
then I'll be surprised if
we can ever feel comforts
ttbleim our own skins.

I’m conscious that
while I'm making irony
out to be some dark
rorcc holding back our
generation’s selfractualr
izalion or whatever,l might seem merely precocious
and dire. But I think rllal irony is a really big problem
in our daily lives. How many times have you been in
a situation where, instead or say
ing something honestly to somv
one you care about, you were just
ironic?

Because honesty sucks. When
I say something as honestly as I
possibly can,1 open myself up to
a lot of criticlsm. Were a very
critical culture. Our national ptls~
time—watching TV—lncans that the majority of
American leisure hours are spent judging orher pcoplo
and then trying to rgnorc a parade oradvcrrisemcnts
trying their best to try to convince us that ifoilly we
bought this new product or that new lifestyle or some
new slogan or creed We would be happy.

You know what? It probably is.

So, when we have a chance to say something
honestly, we mighrjust get the point across by being
ironic, by knowingly and slyly saying the opposirc or
what we mean.

“1 feel like my life has no meaning," we might
say, jokingly, when we really have been wondering
whether our life has no meaning, and we want to tell
our friends that we vc been thinking about this but
