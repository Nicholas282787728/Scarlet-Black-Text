Images of the familiar and foreign at Faulconer

BY LAWRENCE SUMULONC

Although the photographs in An-
gela str-assheinr's Lef/ Be/Jl'n/l series
have an eerie, toorptrrect quality, they
are much more mainstream than her
earlier work photographing cadavers.

Although strassheim is interested
in forensic photography, she realized
lier attraction to pictures ofcorpscs and
autopsies as art was not wrdely shared
by the public. She worked to make her
work more accessible without cornptoe
mising her interests, “I knew I really
named to do art anti so Ijust stuck
with [photography], and decided to go
to graduate school and try to reﬁne rt
instead orshoelo'ng pcoplc,"sard StraSr
sheim. “I feel like I've ﬁnally done that,
but it has taken 30-somc years to get to
that point."

The fruits of her labor are show-
cased in a series called 1.th 81/111th
which is on display at Faulconer Gallery
along With a series by Dutch photogr
raphet Marco van Duyvendijk called
Par‘lmitrﬁom Arin.The exhibit will run
until Dec, 10. As different as the two
featured artists are in their styles and
sensibilities, they both engage the audit
ence with snapshots of a world that is
both familiar and foreign

Strassheim started taking pictures
when she was 14. Later on, she purr
sued what she called “a very traditional
photographic education," attending the
Minneapolis College of Art and De-
sigu as an undergraduate and Yale Unir
versity as ii graduate student.

Strassheim's Llﬁ BE/Ji/ld series was
inspired by childhood memories. The
photographs are seemingly immacu-
late portrayals ottarnihar suburban and
familial scenes. However, Strassheini's

clinical attention to detail and siirgir
cal representation orpeople cand obj rs

unseitle the audience with its insights
into death and isolation.

“The title [of the Ltﬂ Bt/nm/ see
ries] just being surrounded bv death

.is about the people who live on, the
people that catiy on, siid strasshcim.
“It’s also as mueh aboutTim Lal—layes’s
book called chz [fr/11ml, which is about

.. the end of the world and [how] all
the people that believe in God go to
heaven an ill the people that don’t stay
here. So i just as ruuch about , the
fear ofth' being left behind."

While hlaico Vin Duyvendiiks ear
hibit, Pm n-nizrft 0m 111m, dilfers greatly
from Strassheims, the Dutch photog»
tapher's artistic beginnings wcre similar
to his contemporary's. “I was always
taking pictures as a teenager," he said.

“Ijust had fun taking pictures. It suds
denly orew over the years, at a certain
point photography (001: over

In contrast to Strassheiin,
Duyvendijk is a selfrtaught photograr
pher with an educational background
in psychology “[Psyehology] gave me
a lot offree time just to put into phOr
tography," he said. “After graduating l
decided to continue wrth photography
and to do nothing with psychology.”

“Both photography and psychol-
ogy come from the same interest. I'm
interested in people or- how people to
act to each other, or society, culture,"
Duyvendijlt said. “But along the way, 1
found out that photography {or me is
a much better way to investigate those
things that interest me,"
