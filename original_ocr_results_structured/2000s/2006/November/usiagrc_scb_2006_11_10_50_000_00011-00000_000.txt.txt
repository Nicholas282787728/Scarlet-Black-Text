For a nickel a day

My income to this point has been mosdy non-disposable (ale
though I'm hoping tor a big win at PowerBall on Saturday). So
when cash appears in the mail, I get pretty excited.

You see,I recently received a nickel from UNICEF. That’s light,
instead of sending a packet of“rellydmtion salts” to a ﬁve year old in
Uganda, UNICEF sent me a nickel. Let me explain,

Since high school, I occasionally have “given genetouslbels,
say—to charitable organizations, I appreciate what they do for the
world, and I appreciate the complementary backpack, tote hag and
sniffed wolf cub, too. I don’t even too much lnind the solicitations
from other organizations that seem to eolne part-and-parcel with
any donation.

They give me a reason to twirl that little mailbox knob every
morning. It's like spinning a tame wheel: After about four tries,yon
get a prize, and while you usually throw it away, sometimes it‘s pretty
cool, My lifetime supply of animal—adorned address lahcis, tor ex-
ample, arrived courtesy of these mailinghnlthottgll now that the
college relocated its post ofﬁce, I’ll need to give someone another
donation with my new address.

But this envelope from UNICEF was a little overtthettop.

More wasteful than the environmental group that printed all of
its information on plastic stickers.

More guilt—tripping than the 90 percent of
charities whose postage-paid reply envelopes
say, “attaching a stamp here will leave us more
money for kitty neuteringFOr whatever,

Yes,UNICEF sent me a nickel.

To boost its impact, the coin was even view—
able through a little plastic window and was ac-
cented with the words, “This nickel could save
a child's life." “Then why'd you send it to me?”l
blurted in sudden nilivcté.

In two swipes I had the envelope open. Aside
from the nickel, which I added to the 14 cents in my pocket already,
UNICEF, in its thoughtfulness, enclosed a letter. At the end of the
letter, in lnock cursive, was printed,“P.P.S. In the time it took you to
read this letter, dozens oryoung ciuldren died painful, preventable
deaths..." It’s a good point. and luckily for those cllildren,l didn't
actually read the letter,

UNICEF, listen. I understand the gimmicks, and for a lot of
people, I het they work, I feel guilty, honest. Ifl had money, I‘d give
you some, and I’ll even volunteer at your holiday store this winter,
likeI used to. prostage didn’t cost seven nickels more, I’d send this

”The can was even Viewable

through a little plastic window and
was accented W/lll the words, This
nickel (all/d save a (hi/d3 [,fpj" would understand that they might not agree on

nicitel hack to you—along with the one I ﬁshed out nfa heating vent
the other day

And maybe after a few years in school, I can help you out mone
etaiily, or maybe I’ll even he lucky enough to work f0l an NGO Like
you, myself.

But I’m not there yet, so please don’t waste your paper, stickers
or nickels on me.

Dreams a dream

We all have a vision for a greater nation, and I'd like to share
mine with you,

I dream ofa nation free ofoppression. A nation where people are
free to think and aet as they please.This nation would not dictate to
its citizens what they should think, or what they should conform to
as citizens. These citizens would be free to do what they wish, and
not feel threatened by the nation, or other citizens,

This nation would he rrce ofdichotomy, Dicholomy only leads
to stereotypes and hatredCltizens in this nation would understand
that there is no right or wrong, no this or that. This nation would
let people choose what they wish, and every other citizen would
appreciate them for their choices.Their choices may differ amongst
themselves, but the citizens would understand that not everyone
sees life and their nation as they do, and thus
understanding would be reached and hatred
would be avoided.

Every citizen would understand that no two
people are the same. Even if two citizens had a
similar stance on one issue, these two citizens

everything.

Under no circumstances would any ofthese
citizens feel like they had to make all the same
choices as another, even ifthey agreed on lnost
tllings.Tliese citizens would understand the complexities of the na-
tion, and understand that not everything and everyone can he sim-
ply rcduced to a label, A label that may he shared with, say, half the
members of this nation.

This nation would he a nation of understanding, Not harmony,
but understanding. Citizens would disagree, but no lesentment ol
oppression would result from these misunderstandings. No one
would feel the pressure to tell others how to think, or how to act.

This is my dream.
