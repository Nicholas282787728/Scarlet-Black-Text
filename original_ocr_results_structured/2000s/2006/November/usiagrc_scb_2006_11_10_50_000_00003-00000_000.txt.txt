years a boycott of CocatColaifailcd
to meet the required twrrthllds approw
al rating and therefore did not pass.

The voting procedure was changed
from previous years, eliminating op-
tions to abstain or mark “present not
voting." Administrative Coordinator
Nick Blcntowc ’08 said this was intend—
ed to address ms! critic , n, “Before, by
clicking abs , you were essentiall
harming that initiative," Blencowe said.
Since an abstain or present not voting
bid would count towards the total numt
ber of people examining the rnitiative,
it would be detrimental to passing the
initiative with the two-thirds approval
provision. Bleneowe said the new sys-
tem should alleviate much of the confu-
sion otpast years.

Qrorum, or the required number of
students voting in the initiative process
for the ballots to be considered efﬂtlf
tivc, was not reached until 9:50 pm.
on Monday evening, only a few hours
before voting was scheduled to close.
Despite concern about the slow rate of
student voting, the tally passed the 773
mark with plenty oftimc left in the day.
The quorum requirement is designed to

keep the whole student liody involved
in the process ,

Chloe Neely '10 said she felt his
vested in the voting. “i thought it was
important to get my voice out there and
support initiatives," she said

Students voting
this year might have
had momentary dc’ja
vu reading the initia-
tive calling for a boy-
cott ofCoke products
on campus, the tlnrrl
time in two years slut
dents have had that
option. Despite the efforts of boycott
promoters, the initiative fell short of
the required twotthirds approval. Last
fall’s similar measure also failed. This
initiative comes in the wake ofGrinnoll
hacking out of its exclusive contract
with the CocdtCola at the urging of
students Tire dining halls now offer
other brands in addition to Coke.

For spring Melody Knapp '07, the
calls for boycott were getting old. “I
kind of trunk that people are getting
tired ofrt," she said.

Four-teen other Studenttwritten
initiatives were up for voter perusal.
Several of the issues were calls to rot
verse changes made in recent years. An
initiative calling for greater nutritional
value and meal selection in the current
out Takes meal equivalency program
harkened hack to Grab 3:. Go, the meal

Environmental Coordinator reﬂected
a push for further progress on envis
rorrmcnral issues on

pus, One ofthe
in rativc's authors,
Heidi Connor ’09,
was pleased with the
support the measure
received among stu—
dents. “Students and
the greater world
and community realize that environ-
mental issues arc pressing," she said.

Despite the overwhelming support
some of these measures received, the
passage or a measure does not nCCCSt
sarily guarantee action. initiatives arc
essentially surveys of student opinion,
which allow organizations such as SGA
and the administration, as well as indiv
viduals, to set: what issues are important
to the student body.

Yet some students sccm conﬁdent
that the initiatives are important and
actionable. “It brings forward issues
that i might not have necessarily have
known about or cared about but I think
are good for the community in gens
eral," Knapp said, She said the initias
dyes are valuable because “it is good to
bring these ideas forwards and let the
administrators know that, yes, smdents
care.’
