Individual accolades pour
in as Pioneers roll through
Midwest Conference play

5v NATE LINDSEY

The Gtinnell women's soccer team has
yet to allow a goal rn MWC play this season,
recording shutouts agarnst Illinois College
and Beloit College over the past two weeks.
Grinncll’s shutout of Illinois College last Sate
urday was their fourth shutout in four confer-
ence games and eighth overall shutout in ten
games.

“The game went really well," Sophia Skrae
ba ’03 said. “We never play very well at [Illinois
College] because they have a really small field,
and we are a team that likes to stretch the op
posing team out a lot."

Collegiate ﬁelds can differ in size within
certain parameters. Small ﬁelds like the one at
Illinois College mean less working space for
teams that use long balls and speed like the
Pioneers.

The small ﬁeld proved to be merely an an
noyance, as Grinnell downed Illinois College
3-0, out-shooting the Lady Blues 10~2.While
Grinnell came into the match heavily favored,
Skraba still took the match as an opportrrnity
to improve.

“it was a good warm up game before we
took on Macalester the next day."

The Pioneers go into this weekend with
a similar schedule of a lower-tanked Mid-
west Conference team, Ripon college (o4 in
MWC). on Saturday and a more challenging
team, Carroll (270 in MWC), on Sunday.

“Right now we are undefeated in confers
cncc. but we haven't faced any solid opponents
yet," Skraha said, “Coming up this weekend,
we're playing Carroll. They'll he out for our
blood."

Macalester edges Grinnell again

Gnnnell can’t seem to get the Macalester
monkey off its back. Macalester’s 1,0 victory
gave them six wins over the Pioneers in the
past four years.The scots‘ Maggie Yates scored
the only goal ofthe game in the 70,-, minute.

“I thoughtwe playetl fairly weu," goalkeep-
er Liz Carrier '07 said. “We took it to them in
the ﬁrst half, but it was harder in the second
halfbecausc we had the wind against us."

Because of the teams' locations, it is likely
that, like in the past two years, they will find
themselves in the same bracket during the "a,
tional tournament.

Grrnnell continues with conference play
this weekend at Ripon and at Carroll. The
Pioneers will be at home next Saturday agarnst
Lake Forest.

Accolades abound for pioneers

Wins and shutouts are not the only things
the Grinnell Women's soccer team collected
during the ﬁrst half of their seasoanhe Pics
neers, from their ﬁrst-years to therr senior
veterans, have collected individual honors and
awards both regionally and nationally.

Most recently, Carrier was named to the
dSkicltscom National Team of the Week. At
the time of the award, Carrier had been held
rrrg opponents scoreless for 350+ minutes, and
she posted another shutout against Illinois
College in the game following the award ane
rrouncement.

Carrier said that she “sometimes"visits the
d3kicks,corn website, “I'll probably go more
now that they put my name up," she joked.

Along with Carrier's national team recoge
nition, she has earned two Midwest Confer
ence Defensive Performer of the week awards
this season.

Kate Diedrick'07 and Miki Nakiimura '10

“I was in the right place at the right time
to score and get the ball to my teammates,"she
said.

Nakamura, who comes from a private
school and soccer powerhorrse in Honolulu,
l»li., did not play much on her high school vare
sity team, but has found her niche on the field
at Gi'innell.

“She brings another forward with speed to
our front line, which is a nice compliment to
those players we already have there," Benning
said. "She's very quick with the ball.”

While Nakamura speaks strongly with her
play on the field, her teammates say she could
say a brt more off the field.

“She's quiet off the ﬁeld, but she does a
good job of doing what needs to be done on
the ﬁeld." Carrier said. “She's a very creative
player."
