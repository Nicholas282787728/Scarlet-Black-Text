The Grinnell softball team was six
outs away from winning the 2005 Mick
west Conference title last weekend in
Lake Forest, 111., losing in the champ'r
onship game on a dramatic seventh—in—
ning finish after taking a shutout into
the sixth, The team rode strong pitcl’r
ing performances to advance through
the first rounds and earn a shot at Lake
Forest in the championship.

The Pioneers began their road to
the finals against the Ripon Red Hawks
in the opening round of the doubles
elimination tournament. Lee Anne
Steinhcrg '07 pitched a four-hit shut-
out, striking out five, to carry Grinnell
to a ZeO victory. Steinberg got help of
fensively from Emily Stewart '08, who
went 3-for-3 with an RBI.

In the second round, Grinnell gave
up eight runs to Lake Forest and lost
872. Because of the doublenelimination
format, the Pioneers could still advance
to the championship game with another
victory over Ripon.Thc Pioneers took a
20 lead into the seventh before Ripon
plated two runs and foiced the game
into extra innings. In the bottom otrhc
eighth, Darcy Ward '09 hit a dramatic
rWD'mn walk-offhomerun to send the
Pioneers into the championship.

“When we played Ripou earlier
in the season, we had an off day," said
Karyn Wieland ‘06. “At the tourna—
rnent, we played to our potential in all
ofour games, and we dominated Ripen
on offense and defense."

The victories over Ripon meant
Grinnell would play Lakc Forest again
and have to beat them twice in a row

g in the ﬁnals to win the conference title.

Having already lost to the Foiesters,
Grinnell was looking for some clutch
pitching and some big hits.

“Lake Forest is a tough team, but
we came into those [finals] games with
a lot ofintensity and a great game plan,"

said Wieland. “We rotated through
three of our pitchers each game so thnr
they wouldn't ever get comfortable
at the plate Also, our hitting was
consistent and we kept the pressure on
them."

The Grinnell offense came out
swinging in game one, as a threeerun
double by Katie Bartlett ’09 gave the
Pioneers a 3-0 lend in the tirst in-
ning. Lake Forest would plate just one
run en route to a +1 Grinnell victory
thanks to solid defense and pitch
ing performances from Gaby Flores
’09, Stewart and Lee Anne Steinberg
'07. Flores started and pitched three
scoreless innings, Stewart relieved her
and recorded the win, going three in—
nings and allowing one unearned run,
and stcuihcrg recordcd the save with a
scoreless seventh.

in game two, Grinnell again took
an early lead, this time on a solo home-
run by Bartlett and an RBI single from
Madison Sillander ’08. They took this
are lead into the smh befoie the‘ Lake
Forest offense plated two runs to tie the
game. An RBI single in the bottom of
the seventh capped the exciting victory
for the Foresters, leaving the Pioneers
just short of winning the champion-
ship,

Despite the loss, the Pioneer soft
ball team finished a winning season
with a mark of23-15 over-all and 8-5 in
the Midwest Conference, Head Coach
Tom Sonmchsen could not be more
pleased with his team’s effort and looks
for more of the same next year.

“I think the’accomplishmcnts of
this team is a result ofa fine group of
young ladies working towards a single
goal, that being improvement every
game," said Sonnichsen. “Many out-
standing players were asked to play
various roles. Each member ofthe team
made their contriburion. As these play-
ers gain more experience, they will just
get better andlg tter.’

Last Thursday, the mens and womens track teams
sent a small group ofathletes to compete in the For
rest Ringers Invitational hosted hy coe college.
Men's coach Will Freeman called the unscored meet
a “jumping board" to the Midwest Conference oue
door Championships this weekend.

some athletes took the jumping board metaphor
literally, as Scott Schmidt ’06 took ﬁrst in the pole
vault, clearing 13’. Anna Gilbert ’09 vaulted into the
record books, clearing a personal-best 10'6"ai1d mov-
ing into second place all-time at Grinnell.

“It felt great to set a personal record last week,"
Gilbert said. “It means I am improving and hope to
keep improving through the conference meet."

While neither team sent many distance runners
to Coe, both teams used the meet as a chance to fine»
tune technique in the field events. On the men's side,
Willie Stewart'OS ﬁnished second in the javelin with
a throw of179’2". On the women's side, Caitlin Shanr
non ’07 broke her own school record with a hammer
throw of 114'.

Most of the runners that went were either using
it as a workout or going for lower seeds heading in to
the conference meet. Nick Sparr ’09 came in third in
the 1500m with a time of 4:12.83. Allison Louthan
’08 also moved up in the record hoards, moving into
fourth alhtllﬂc in the 800m with a time of2:20.68.

Several runners on the women’s team are at or
near the top ofthe conference rankings heading into
the meet this weekend. Sara Blady ’07 is ranked first
in the 10k and second in the 5k, right behind her
tcammdte Sarah Spciiccr’08,who is also ranked third
in the 1500, Louthan is second in the 800 and second
in the 15 00.

The women also have the top—ranked 4x400 team
ofMarta Grabowski ’08,]ulie Ault’OS, Kate Diediick
’07 and Molly Kratz ’08. Kratz will contend for the

Gilbert is ranked third in the conference in the pole
vault. Bartlett has not made many throws on the track
during this outdoor season, because the two-sport
athlete was making throws from behind the plate for
the softball team.The Des Moines native won the “'1’
door shot put championship and is currently ranked
second in the conference in discus, despite not throw-

 

that the women can improve on their fourth place fin-
ish from last year and, in doing so, ﬁnish a great year
for Grinnell women’s athletics. “Unless we all get the
mumps, we should win the [Midwest Conference]
women's allesports trophy,"she said.

The men's team will look to the senior duo of
Justin Riley and Dave Honig to lead the way. Riley
is ranked second in the 1500m and third in the 5k,
w'hile Honig is just ahead of him in the 5k and leads
the conference in the 10k. These two are backed up
by Nick Fogg '06, ranked fourth in the wit. sprinters
Benj Wagman ’08, Joel Huisenga ’08, Kyle Perry ’08
and Patrick Laine ‘08 hope to steal some points in the
4x100m and 4X400m, with Laine as a potential scorer
in the 400m hurdles.

In the ﬁeld events, Schmidt is the team’s top pole»
vaultcr and ranks sixth in the conference. Despite not
throwing the javelln iirany meets last year, Grinnell
native Stewart has surprised the competition this
year and heads into the weekend ranked second in
the conference. Darren McNahb ’07 has also become
a major factor on the team and is ranked fourth in the
hammer throw

“We have a number of top athletes in this meet
who have a chance of winning their events," Coach
Will Freeman said. “It will be an exciting weekend
for everyone.”

Coaches and athletes from both teams look for-
ward to hosting Grinnell’s ﬁrst conference champion»
ship meet since 2001 and emphasize the importance
ofa high level offan support and attendance.

“or all the meets this year I enjoyed the Dick
Young Classic the most,” said Stewart. “It really

and I hope we can get a good crowd out there this
weekend.” .
