Musical mixes potty humor and political message

BY Rcaeccrt PARK

Urinmnmr: T/M Murr‘r/r/ features all the classrc musical thee
atre conventions known to even the most casual theatergoer.
Boy meets girl. Boy and girl face some unforeseen relarlorrshrp
obstacles that would easily have been avoided if actual toms
rnrrniearion hadn't been replaced with soaring love ballads and
snazzy choreography.

And, of course, boy and girl plot to overthrow evil, corrupt
corporation.

Granted, it may not be Rodgers and Hammer-stein, but one
could think of Unlil'lotim as a contemporary Okla/Jamal, update
ed for cynical 21st century audiences. With dark, absurd humor
and a story that addresses relevant social issues, this semester’s
GIMP (Grinnell Independent Musical Productions) show ap—
peals both to musical fairs and to the more
jaded amongst us, who could never quite
reconcile random outbursts of song wrtlr
rcaliry, Here we have a producriorr pert
fectly willing to acknowledge the inanity
of musical theatre, with even our narrator
Lockstock never failing to remind us just
how silly everything on stage really is.

The story is set in a modern day wasteland, where water is
in such short supply that public pay per use rollers are the only
available ainenitiesﬂ perfect opportunity for a monolithic
company to profit. Our hero Bobby Strong doesnt believe that
it should be“ a privilege to pee and starts his revolution despite
rlre ominous specter of"Urinetowii,"where drssenters go and
are never heard from again, Romantic complications ensue afe
ter he falls for Hope, the daughter ofthe show’s villain Caldwell
B. Cladwell. Not only are we following the standard musical
plotline, but we also have the requisite ridiculous names.

such a great job that my biggest worry about opening is that
I don't know ifI can make it through a run-through without
laughing out loud. I feel rhat’s a pretty good worry [0 have."

Nor that the ofihcat should be a surprise, considering
GlMP's history, Frrst organized a few years ago rn response
to the Theatre Department’s preference for straight drama, the
group “grew out ofa desire to do musical theatre," Leda l-Ioff—
mann '09, the show's director, said. Filling tlml void in previous
years with productions of shows as varied as Hair, The Last
Five Years and Baby, GIMP continues its tradition of unconr
ventional musicals this semester wrth Urinetown.

This year, though,brings new opportunities and challenges,
representing a pivotal point in GIMP’s development. Most
notably, the produetron features one ofthe largest casts in the
organization's history: 20 actors, 15 of
whom are ﬁrstryeiirs. Hoffmann said
this large pool of new talent confirms
GIMP’s ability to strengthen and grow
in the coming years.

The class diversity contributes to
the dynamics of the cast. “There is a
large diversity ofprevious theatre expe
rience in the cast ranging from senior Theatre majors to people
who have never been in a full length production, Hoflman
said Having a diversity of experience means that there rs a
great opportunity for everyone to learn from each other."

The beneﬁts have been mutual, “GIMP has been a great
way for me to get into theatre at Grinnellfbosworth said.“It's
lovwkey but everyone is committed to the show.”

Along with its unique title, Urinetown presents the cast
and directors with the unique problem ofhalarrclng the show's
social message with its rampant sarcasm. But herein lies the
beauty of Urinetown As Hoffman“ said, “It’s a show with a
social message, but it s also about pee!"

New art gallery benefits student artists and Grinnellian meal- -goers

BV RAQUEL MORALES

some Grinnellians may have been surprised to frntl an art
gallery near the backpack-crowded entrance to the new dining
hall rn the campus Center. However, one cannot help biit agree
with Matt Kluber, Arr, who oversees the gallery, that visibility
is outstanding'

The three artists featured in the new student art gallery so
far, Natalie Larson 07, Amos Goldbaum 08 and John Bell 08
are happy that their art is more accessible to the campus corn-
muniry, The art creates "a dialogue between Grinncll artists and
the campus in general,"Bell said.

Larson’s exhibit, whreh went on display in midrOctober,
was a collection ofblaclt and white monotypes of nude ﬁgures.
“It seems that there are a lot more people coming to my show
than the ones rhar would have come if rhey hadn't just passed
by,"she said. .

Goldbaum, the winner oflast year’s Grinnell College third
year portfolio amrds, was the second artist to exhibit. His
screenprints are based on popular art and contemporary culture.
“Pretty much anything visual, ifyou address it as a visual expo
riencc, then you're addressing it as a piece ofart," he said.

Bell was the winnerofthe second-year portfolio award'rhe
main idea behind his abstract show is the tension between sym-
metry and asymmetry. The result is an exhibition consisting of
large panel paintings, crossrscction prints and ink designs. Bell

wants to show that abstract art doesn't mean something “pre»
renrious, or high art that you’re not supposed to understand."
Some students and faculty have expressed concerns about
various aspects of the gallery. Goldbaum said he worries about
security issues. The gallery is monitored by the Information
Desk staff. During his exhibition, one of his pieces was rce
moved from the crystal display case next to the entrance ofthc

dining hall “It was a piece of cardboard that had before and
after pictures and an advertisement for Hydroxyeut, a weight
loss formula," said Goldbaum in an email. “Someone may have
thought it was an advertisement."

Others have raised concerns about the room’s architecture.
one of the walls is curved, which makes it difﬁcult to display
framed artwork. There is also a small, square window in the
middle of that wall, which decreases available space. "That was
the architects work and architects areift always sensitive to the
needs [of art galleries]," Kluber said.

However, these inconveniences have been minor so far.
“We'll just take it from show to show and see what we need to
do," said Kluber. Exhibits have contained art that can be dis
played on the crrrved wall, and the window will eventually be
blocked by a window plug.

Currently, only art majors are eligible to display work in the
gallery, but Kluber did not rule out the possibility that non-art
majors or student groups could use the space. "It’s so new at this
point and it really would depend on the quality [ofthe art],"he
said. Students who want to exhibit in the gallery submit short
proposals, which are reviewed by art department faculty,

After Bell’s exhibit, the art gallery will feature the three-
dimensional art of Ross Koon ’06, the recipient of the ninth
semester art fellowship. Exhibition proposals for the spring 56*
rnester are currently being considered by the Art department.
