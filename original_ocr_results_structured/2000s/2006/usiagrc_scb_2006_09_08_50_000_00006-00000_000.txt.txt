Rebel Without
a Cause

*ittﬁ

Relxr/ ”Growl/A Cﬂlllt' features
Jamcs Dean in his hrciltout role as
Jim Stark, tlic nttlucnt youngster
who's looking to rebel against .. well,
whatever they got,

Dean's character Stark, as well as
John “Plato"Crawfoi'd (Sal Miuco)
and Judy (Natalie Wood) all seem
to have pretty lous reasons for their
misﬁt ways. But regardless oitheir
motivations, James Dean is {into c.
the quirky acting gives teen angst a
voice before teen angst even existed.

Female lead Judy is less inspiring.
It‘s fitting that she only has a first
name,because she's the most confus~
ing ofthe lot. We’re talking about a
woman who bursts into tears while
talking about her abusive father, but
states over the edge of the cliff her
boyfriend just plummeted ortwith a
look ofmild fascination on her face.

Thankfully, Stark is enough ofa
powerhouse character that he can cart
ry this entire damn thing by himself
ifneed be. For the first hour or so, he
doesn't need to; watching this cool kid
deal coolly with romance and scuriles
is entrancing enough in its own right
But once the boyfriend takes a dive,
things start to sputter a bit. The end»
ing will draw you back in, though, and
be glad of it. Overall, this movie isn’t
quite the classic it's built up to be, but
it's a damn good ride nonetheless.

The Holy Girl
*titﬁ

The opening scene ofwriter/direCt
tor Luereeia Martel’s second ﬁlm, The
Holy Girl, shows a teacher giving her
class of Catholic students a lesson on
the importance of being receptive to
God’s signs. The teacher’s claim that
“you can't confuse ugliness with beaur
ty" proves to be tenuous, as one of her
students, Amalia (Maria Alche), soon
thereafter finds the profound in the
profane. During a street performance,

n man presses himself provocatively
against Amalia from behind. orcouise,
she interprets the lewd gesture as a sign
that God wants her to save this man’s
soul, The than (Curios Belloso) hap-
pens to be a doctor attending a medical
convention at the hotel where Amalia
and her mother live, The icst of the
movie takes place primarily it the hot
tel,wllcre we sec Amalia stalk Delano,
who, in turn, feebly flirts with Anialia's
mother H I (Mercedes Morin).
Some clitics have complaintd that
Maitel’s work is too understated, but
for this film, less is indeed more. By
honing in on mundane details, such {is
water droplets on a face, Martel keeps
us fiom generalizing too much about
the hig picture. ls Dr. lino u pervert,
or just halmlessly horny? ls Amulra’s
mission a facade, or do her players ﬂow
trom a pure liealt? lt can be frustrat—
ing that the ﬁlm does not spoon-reed
us simple answers to these questions,
but ultimately the ambiguity holsters
the film's ccntml theme. By throw-
ing us into the hullabaloo ofa hotel at
awkward camera angles, Martel helps
us accept that there isn’t always a big
pictuminoi’ every man is a hero or
a villain, not every woman a slut or a
saint. So, in the spirit of rejecting tired
dichotom‘ies, this movie is neither good
nor bad. It‘s just honest.

Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
ﬁttiﬁ

KISS Kiri Bang Bang is not your
typical movie title, nor is it your typi»
cal movie. At the end ofthe film, you’ll
still be wondering about the relation
between the movie and its title (also,

, incidentally, the Japanese press’s nick-

name for James Bond), out at least
you’ll be wondering With a reel-good-
movie grin.

Put together a heartdown Robert
Downey In, a studly Val lCilmer, an
eagerstosimpress Michelle Monaghan
and an always imaginative Shane Black
and you have a fully engrossing con-it
say/action/thriller. Downey, playing
Harry Loekhart, delivers a riveting
performance, transforming from petty
thief to actor to private eye. Writer

Cir-Meta his up arms in City or God.

Black enlivens Lockhart’s saga with
hilarious onetliners. Val Kilmer’s chart
actor, a tough, sassy gay detective who
is anything but effeminate, blends per
fectly with Downey’s character.

Kiri Kris Bang Bang. would deﬁ-
nitely have been a ﬁve-star ﬁlm but
for the clumsy ending where Downing
appears all too magical in his Rambo»
style killings, and everything wrong is
predictably rightcd out.

Kin Kiri Bang Bang is hilarious and
provides a welcome change from more
stereotypical movies of the genre,

City of God
*ittﬁ

It all starts with a runaway chicken,
It’s a scene from a quaint neighbor
hood barbecue~until triggershappy
children chase after the illtfated poult
try with their handguns.

Welcome to the City of God (Cit
dade de Deus), a Rio de janeiro slum
circa 1960, where drugs and guns are
inescapably dominant features of the
landscape. It‘s a cruel world, with vi-
cious children and teenagers heading
gangs, lording over drug rings and fu-
eling personal enmities in attempts to
gain money, power, or both. First-time
director Meirelles delivers the convo»

—t

COURTESY WW\\’.FOLLO\V-ME-NOW.DE

luted essence of the Cidade de Deus
through the naive eyes of the teenaged
Rocket (Alexandre Roderigues).

As gang leader Li’l ze sheds blood
to seize power in the neighborhood,
Rocket tries, and repeatedly fails, to
lose his virginity and start his photogt
raphy career. His is an often comedic
personal narrative that frequently
intertwines, segues, then rejoins the
larger story of Cidade de Deus's rule
by the gangs.

Through Rocket's eyes, Meirelles
is able to depict the ultra-violence and
inimitable brutality in the slums with»
out plunging into heavythandcdncss
or glossing over it with nonchalsncc,
Cinematographer Charlone’s use of
Dutch angles, dizzying cimcm paths
(ie from u bullets point ofview) and
Rocket's own photos gives the audi-
ence insight into life in the slums of
the Cidade de Deus.

What begins with a chicken must
end with a chicken, and in circular
fashion, the children chasing the abs
sconding poultry rise as Li'l Ze’s reign
dissolves. There is nothing remotely
divine about the City of God , it is,
more than anything else, Hell‘s Paras
dise. Despite the misnomer, the movie
irselIis rich with authenticity and car»
ties a powerful message that lingers
long after the violence onscreen has

ended.
