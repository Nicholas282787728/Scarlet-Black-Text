A: it's a thing that people have done
since the movie came out. There tire
people that do rhe show every Saturday
at midnight. It’s a lot of fun for every
one. It’s something people do all over
the country and it’s cool to know we're
part of that community. The movie its
selfis kind ofdumb and stupid,but the
ethos of the people who do the show.
We're all weirdos and bizarre. 1n Reaiy,

there’s no limits or rules about who can

be a part ofit.All you have to do is like
Italy and like yelling obnoxious things
and that's a pretty big percentage of
this campus.

Right. Cuz they don’t get it. And
that's just to make fun and tease. it’s
not scrious. There’s a
semblance of hazing, of
an initiation ritual. It’s
kind of a perverse sil—

The first time you
go, you don'r know any-
thing about it. People
are yelling and throwmg things and
making bid puns. It's like, “Why are
people doing thisl> That‘s not even fun—
ny, why are people laughing?” But it's
not about what they’re saying, it's about
that they’re all doing it together.

Yeah, there are
people who do
know the show and
know all the catcalls
but who aren’t in it.
We try to get them
to come and they always do because it’s
Risky.

Frank's kind of evil, when it re-

sympathize with him.

David DeGeest’06

Yeah, you could see it that way. But
really he's kind ofjust using cvcryonc in
the show for his own ends, to give himr
self pleasure . ..Whethcr you see him as
a tragic hero depends on whether you
see rhe pursuir or his own pleasure as
a good thing or not. He's just perverse.
He does these things and he’s aware
of his actions, but he‘s very self-inter-
cstcd.

Yeah, I'm wander-
ing around in tight
pants and to some ch
tcnt the show is kind
of about me whipping
Riff Raff or strutting
around in high heels,
But on some level you
have to sympathize
with the character in
order to get the right
facial expressions, the right movements

.. It’s somewhere between acting and
performance.

mixed?

No, I know everyone who's in the
show I’m sure there will be someone
who feels embar-
rassc‘ﬂ for me I
told my dad about
it and he was really
excited about it. He
was like, “I rcmcm»
her Ratky Horror,
that was a good
time!"

Ave you afraid
ofwimz people are going in Mint ofyou
Monday rimming?

Not really, I can’t imagine people
getting upset about it. Probably some-
one will make a little snarky comment
about my ﬁshnets But that’s part of
the whole thing. I‘ll feel a Little insulted,
in fact, if someone doesn’t at least say
something.
