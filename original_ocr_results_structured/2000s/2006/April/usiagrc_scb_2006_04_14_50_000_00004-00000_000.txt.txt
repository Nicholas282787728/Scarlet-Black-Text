The ‘Huck Finn’ of biochemistry A uaporins

Dr. Peter c Agre gave the schol-
ar 5 Convocation Thursday. Agre won
the Nobel Prize in Chemisty in 2003
for his discovery of aquaporins, a roll
structure used in osmosis.

This is a new ofﬁce at Duke that
was conceived by the chancellor, who
just arrived a year before I did, Vincenr
Dsau. He came from Harvard, and I
had been interested in several things
in addition to lab science, so this ofs
ﬁce allows me to pursue several things.
The major thing I would be doing for
Duke is spearheading the M.D./Ph.D.,
special graduate program for medical
students who want to pursue research
careers. Also, I’m involved in educa~
tional outreach opportunities for Duke,
and some science policy issues, which
I am personally very concerned about
directions of science in the U.S. [The
ofﬁce] will also give me a platform to
chair the committee in Human Rights
for the National Academy of Sciences.

Our own lab has been working on
these proteins that we termed the
aquaporins, that channel a
lot of water across cell
membranes They're
involved in many dif—
ferent physiological
parhways and clini
cal disorders, and we
are still working on
them I am travel-
ing a lot, trying to visit
young scientists around
the country, around the
world and [show] them
that the projects we are pursuing With
the aquaporins are ﬁllly Concrclc and
have strong CLInchl relevance.

working on the molecular basis of the Rh blood anov
gen, which is very important clinically, but is not
understood on the basic level, or was not at least
when we started the studs
w ies more than 15 years ago.
In the process of isolating
the core protein of the Rh
anogen complex, we made
vertently isolated a second
protein that turned out to
have the function of the
water channels. It was re—
ally screndipity. It was not
a planned scientiﬁc goal, it
was something that fell into
our labs.Then, of course, the
challenge is to ﬁgure outwhat it

did, and all that worked out really well.

Millions ofpcoplc around rhc world
who believe in nonsv‘lolence resistance
movements follow the guidelines that
Srdja Popovic, the distributor ofAmztoe
my of 0 Revolution, authored.

“When you go to dcrnonsrrarions
there are u few things you must learn.
First you must keep people busy,” said
Popovic, “[Thcn], you put the banners
in trout because you don't want your
people to see the enemy"

Popovic brought his experiences to
Grinnell for two days of activities. On
Thursday he hosted a discussion of the
ﬁlm Bringing Down a Dlrzolar and to
day he leads a workshop on noneviolenr
resistance.

Popovic is a co-leader of CANVAS,
an organization that teaches nonsvio»
lent resistance to authoritarianism.

The organization has successfully
worked with Egypt, Iran, Lebanon,
Georgia, Belarus, Azerbaijan and other
countries to develop and implement
movement strategies.

The talk by Popovic is sponsored by
the Center for Peace Studies, which was
jointly established by Grinnell College
and The Iowa Peace Institute.

“That didn't seem like a fair come
