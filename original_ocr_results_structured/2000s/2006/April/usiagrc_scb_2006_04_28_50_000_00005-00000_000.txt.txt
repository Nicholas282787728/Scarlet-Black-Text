Fantasy book tLIrned reality

Claire Wenngren ’08 self publishes politlcal science ﬁction novel

av SARAH MIRK

In eighth grade, Claire wenngren
'08 made a promise to herself to be
published before anyone else in her
family. Driven by sibling rivalry as
much as her own need to write, she
self-published her 350-pnge novel
[Yuri earlier this year. “It's a political
science—fiction thriller," chngren
said, "and it’s very dark."

While Auri fulfills her publishing
pact, it is not Wenngren’s first novel.
She wrote two complete novels in
high school and partially ﬁnished a
third. “They wcre terrible,” she said
without hesitation, adding that she
hasn’t seen the manuscripts in years.

wenngren began Ann her senior
year in high school, envisioning a
book with a more political angle than
her previous purely fantasy and scie
ence-fiction works. She centered the
plot around a charac»
ter named Nebbe, the
closest adviser to a
“greedy capitalist over-
lord" who he is secretly
working to undermine.

“It’s science-ﬁction
with a racial tension
component," she said.

The story is not uplifting.
Wenngren finished the book and
then was forced to take a year off af-
ter high school to recover from a see

Ieruion component”

rioiis illness. Additionally, “it‘s gotten
darker since I’ve been at Griniiell," she
said. Wenngren modeled the setting
of the book utter grim
St Petersburg weather
and several of the main
characters meet grisly
deaths, such as starving
and death off a cliff. going it? app
"Whilelwas writing

it, I was thinking, "This ence.
is probably not going to
appeal to a wide audi-

she said. Despite

”WW/e / was

ence,
this self—professed unmarketability of
her novel, Wenngren sent the manu-
script off to major science-fiction pub-
lishing house Tor Publishing “They
sent me a letter that said ‘Auri' does not
ﬁt our current publishing needs,” said
Weiingren.

Next she tried a smaller publisher,
Vantage Press
“They told me
they don’t accept
submissions with
out an agent and
I deﬁnitely didn’t
have an agent," she

said.

With that, she shelved Aui'i for al-
most a year, instead turning her atten-
tions to the her first year at Grinnell.
;When the homework onslaught
slowed, wenngren again began itch-

CIaireWenngten’OS

thinking This is probab/y not

ing to get published and googled
“independent publisher." She came
up with the website authorhoiisccom
which, for 3500,
would print her
book and even
send her one
complimentary
copy. wenngren
revised her
n o w- d u s t y
novel,toning
down the thick
dialects the lan-
guage lover had 'given so many char-
ﬁcters.

Ami went to press in January, and
so {at has fulﬁlled Wengrenn’s cynical
prediction: it has sold five copies, in-
cluding three bought by her mother

“My dad gave up reading it,” she
said, saying he couldn’t get through
some of the still difﬁcult dialects.

Currently-shes petitioning the
campus bookstore to order copies of
the novel. “I know at least 10 friends
who would buy it. Well, wait, with
Dag, maybe more like so."

In the meantime,Wenngren plans
on reading Tie Communirl Marinara
to see if it as similar to Alm‘ as her
friends have told her and also work—
ing on Ann’s sequel, Gaul'iana, which
she promises will be “more depress
ing" than the ﬁrst.

Beyond Nature. Landscaping at Grinnell

bv KATIE MCMULLEN

Barefoot students wallt across campus while trees
and flowers blossom.

These signs of spring are the result of Facilities
Management efforts. Crews spend months planning
and planting In preparation for spring. Beautiful gar-
dens that seem to burst forth with a little rain and
sunshine are actually carefully cared for, and cotter
spond to an overall design.

“I have two people who spend the nine months of
the growing season on ﬂower bed maintenance
mulching around, the clean up work associated with
it,"said Mike Bun, a Facilities Management Associr
ate Director, Landscape and Hauling. Everyyear, Burt
and his staff plant hundreds of
flats of annuals, colorful flowers
that only live for one year. The
ﬂowers themselves are locally
grown and purchased from a
family—owned greenhouse in
Searsboro.

“This time oryear were do»
ing a lot of ﬂower planting In
the beds near Herrick Chapel
and Steiner," siiid Kip Kelley
or, a tour- -year employee ofFacilities Management.

Burt, along with horticulturist Ralph Eyberg and
grounds man Doug DcIong, oversees planning, in-
stallation and maintenance of Grinnells landscape
Most recently, maintenance has become the greatest
concern tor Facilities Management.

“Seventeen years ago when I started, there were
two ﬂower beds on campus, two places for ﬂowers.
Now we have a lot more than that."

When it comes to designing these new gardens,
the Facilities Management landscapers abstain from
careﬁllly manicured landscape art. Instead, design has
recently fallen to people who don't actually do the
planting. “With the recent new construction... the
architects are having some involvement in the design

it was.”

”We noticed [the ﬂowers] but
/ never assumed [I was inten—
il'anai. / just assumed it’s the way

Kevin Potter’09

and I 11 review it some and then that will be planted
by an outside contractor or landscape company. And
then we begin the maintenance on it," said Burt,

But even with the alteration in the design pro-
cess, Eyberg, with a degree in landscape architecture,
continues to design certain aspects of Gtiniiell land~
scoping.

“There's an overall master plan," said Eybcrg.
”[when people like] President Osgood wants a land
scape done or some people landscaped mound, we’ll
do a drawing out. They'll either have a professional
firm do it or I could sketch some stuff out."

Throughout all the planning and implementation,
Grinncll landscapers hnve tried to develop a simple
style, reminiscent ofold England.

“I don't know if you’d call it kind'
era pastoral landscape look,"said Eye
berg, that would be one way to look
at it [like some] landscaping in Eng-
land back around the 1800s and a lot
of the campuses theyre big central
campuses with wide, sweeping areas
of open space with your groupings of
trees and shrubs."

“It feels different, it feels like
spring," said Irinayd Mahmood ’09. “The landscaping
in Mac field reminds me of Ireland because every
thing is so lush and greenThc ﬂowers in particularI
see them around, like Ill the bases of trees lt lends
the campus a bit of a ‘spring renewal reeling."

Even with the apparent beauty, students aren’t ale
ways aware of the time put into bringing beauty to
the campus.

“I've noticed [the ﬂowers], but I never assumed
it was intentional. I just assumed it’s the way it was,"
said Kevin Potter ’09.

Ironically, the ﬂowers spring up right as snidents'
schedules get more hecticwitli the rigorous last stretch
of class assignments before graduation.

“This year I've been kind of not noticing them as

much,” said Anna Prescott ’07. “I’ve just been kind
or really busy this year and haven’t even stopped to
look."

Taking pride in his work, Burt encouraged stu»
dents to take a minute to appreciate the beauty of the
campus.

“Get out and enjoy the weather and the campus.
That's what it's here for."
