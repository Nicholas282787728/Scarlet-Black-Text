Cartoon, cont. from p. 8
nearly as many words proclaim the irrelevance of religious concerns
as actually critique the cartoon.

Although the editors state that many Muslims view depictions of
the Prophet as sacr'ilege. they abruptly dismiss this claim and assert a
right to criticize religion. In addition, the next sentence subordinates
this Islamic faith claim to that French saint of Western liberalism and
religious skepticism. Voltaire. Just as the editors speak up for victims
of racism. they should have championed (rather than dismissed) the
cause of Muslims who felt that their religion was attacked,

In the aftermath of publication. The Salad has partially corrected
its error. On their oft-updated Plan. its editors have admitted to re—
ligious insensitivity and pledged to not post the cartoon in their web
edition.They. however, continue to erroneously insist that they must
choose between printing the cartoon and ignoring the whole matter
altogether. Tbs Salad needs to explain why describing and criticizing
the image is insufficient.

In the S i‘iRs eyes. the broader cartoon crisis shows the importance
for journalists to balance free speech with civic responsibility. Vicwcd
in isolation. it may seem crazy and wrong that poorly drawn cartoons
could provoke embassy burnings and bloodshed. Free speech, after all,
is a ﬁindamental right and essential for the functioning ofdcmocrncics
cvcrywhcrc. Ifyou are offended by speech. you should write a letter to
the editor or pickct a building, When journalists and arn'sts arc int-inns
dated. they stop pushing society to improve and everyone loses.

Still. possessing the right to free speech does not mean we should
invoke it in every situation. For atamplc. when the Danish newspaper

Letters to the Edito

fyl/amir-Painen printed its cartoons ridiculing Muhammad. it knew
that Europe was a underbox and many Muslims would be incensed.
Western powers were waging war in two Muslim-majority states and
anti-Muslim xenophobia was running rampant. In fact. according to
the Danish Institute for Human Rights. racially motivated crimes
doubled in Denmark from 200472005.

Given the delicate cultural context, the Danish newspaper proba—
bly should have refrained from printing the cartoons immediately af-
ter they were printed, the situation could have exploded. But. it didn't.
Danish Muslims peacefully protested and pleaded with politicians for
empathy After seeing the public outcry, a socially responsible and un-
biased publication would have: a) printed it retraction and apology, or
b) used the furor to bring attention to the marginalization of Muslims
and explore the reasons behind their resentment.

fy/[arids-Peltzn chose neither. After months ofbeing ignored, local
Muslims found a sympathetic ear among radicals abroad. Shared rc—
sentment quickly turned into violence. We don‘t condone the violence
and intimidation that occurred, bur wc understand why it happened
and how the press could have helped avoid it.

Unlike Denmark, America is an international behemoth that led
the wars in Muslimemajotity countries. Our sweeping and insensi—
tive domestic and international policies have bred deep resentment
in many Muslims everywhere In our predicament, it is ofvital ima
portancc that journalists actjudiciously so as not to contribute to the
reputation of American media as biased and insensitive. By not [er
printing the Danish cartoons. mainstream American media took a
step in the right direction.

Looking for solutions, not cheap entertainment

“You ask her what her breast size is and if she shaves anything
other than her legs.” Chris Hansen, the host of the Dateline NBC
series, “To catch a Predator." noted. “Are you awe that you're saying
this to a girl who you believers 14-years»old?"Undcr Hanscn's gaze,
a Aanearaold man just stared at the ground, concealing his face and
sinking further into his chair in embarrassment.

I stared at my television screen In disbelief. looking at my family
as if asking them to reaffirm what my eyes had just seen on primetime
television. Moments earlier, stone Phillips breathy and exaggerated
voice had ﬁlled my ears: “They’re back!" he announced,“More online
cluld predators showing up for what they believe Is a date with an
underage teen!” Yet I hadn‘t exacrly realized what I was about to see.
A 4oeycareold man confessing to sending a preadolesccnt girl pictures
of his genitals destroyed any doubts I might have had about where
Datcline’s story was heading. For the next hour I watched in shock
and revulsion.

For those readers who are not familiar with the series, this par
ticular Dateline investigation deals with cyberptedati'on. According to
the show’s host. Chris Hansen. child predation via the Internet has, in
recent years, become a disturbingly widespread national “epidemic."
Federal authorities note that between 5007700 thousand child predaa
tors prowl through the blogs. spaces and online diariesof children
every day. looking for preadolescents with whom they hope to commit
lewd acts. Indeed. 20-30 percent ofall prison cells are estimated to be
filled with sex offenders. In response to the prevalence ofcybcrsprcdaa
tion. a number ofotficial and unofficial organizations have formed in
hopes ofcombating internct pedophilia by posing as 14—year—old boys
and girls. ﬁnding potential predators and disclosing their information
to authorities

For their report. Dateline producers enlisted the service of one
such organization. Perverted-Justice. Allowmg trained volunteers
to work according to their normal standard operating procedures.
Dateline arranged for Perverted-Justice to send porcntial predators.
with whom they had had sexual conversations over the Internet. to a
predetermined house installed with Dateline hiddcnscamems. From
there on. it was Hansen’s job to confront these men With not only
the transcripts of their inappropriately rank internct conversations. but
also with an audience ofAmcrican viewers backing him up and pass-
ing judgment. The show, designed apparently to bc educational for
children and informative for parents, quickly pushed. in my opinion,
the boundaries ofwlint can be shown and said on television in good
taste.

I was not only appalled with the men presented to Americans as
Immoral. pathetic and reprehenSIblc cybcrprcdttors (which were all
justifiable adjectives). but also, with Dateline NBC itself As a guest
in my family’s homc, had producers really elected to present a story or
this kind. shrouding it with a claim of journalistic and moral responsi-
bility to “save our children” from perverted adults?

To Hansen. Datehne’s motives were clearly justiﬁable. Their inves
tigation was vitally important to the mission of educating Ameiicuns
about the prevalence ofchild prcdarion. to catching their men in the
act. to taking them off the proverbial street and.us a result, to making
the Internet a safer place for our children to enjoy. I readily agree that
these are all honest and justifiable goals. Child predation is a tragedy.
The painﬁJl stories ofadults and children retelling their memories of
sexual molestation by adult strangers and perverted relatives make this
phenomenon all too real. I agree with society that soliciting sex from
a minor is wrong and that those who commit such actions need to be

unmasked and apprehended.

What does not follow. however. is why Datclinc feels the need to
expose these men on national. primetime television, to parade them
around like uncivilized circus animals before millions of American
viewers. and to recount their unseemly sexual fantasies from Internet
transcripts Indeed. it seems that the show is incapable ofmaintaining
at least a trace of journalistic integrity and consideration of its status
as a guest in our homes. Although predators have broken the law by
agreeing to meet with underage children for sex. should they really be
exposed in every American living room? And even though the show
is important to raising awareness. should the smutty sexual desires of
men really be read during an hour when our children haven’t yet gone
to bed? Indeed. it is possible that in trying to expose the dark comers
otour society we can overreach our jurisdiction and shed too much
light on them

The question then is: has NBC gone too far? I a'sk you,Dateline1
Is it really necessary to show these men squirm and writhe as Hansen
looms over them judgingly? Is it really necessary for Hansen's voice to
resound in our homes, "And you say ‘would you ever try anal? ‘ouch.
that could hurt,’she says. ‘Not ifdone right,You have to be very gentle
with that.’ you say. Qiite the Romeo?" Is it really necessary to confront
a man with his desires for sex with a dog on national television? Is it
really necessary to ask a man to take his clothes off in the garage be-
fore entering the house, and then marveling that he would actually do
so? My response is a resounding NO!

I realize that these men planned to take something away from mil—
lions of children. leaving memories that would never be overcome and
forgotten. but they are still human beings, and therefore, should not
become entertainment for Jane and John Doe America. Stories that
increase pubhc knowledge about the dangers of cyberpredadon are
indeed vital But ones overlaid with adult material and pornographic
conversations cross the Iine.Thcse men have tiansgrcsscd the bound-
aries ofsocially accepted norms, morals and laws. but in a sense. hasn't
Dateline erred as well by bringing smut into our homes?

Perhaps the way in which we respond to child predation is inapa
propriate Rather than exposing predators on hidden-camera inves-
tigations and hoping that the next batch" will get the message we
could respond by seeking to understand this problem. treating it at
cordingly and combating cyberpredat‘ion at the root. Indeed, Hansen
is astonished that after Datdine’s efforts cyberpredatots still haven't
been frightened and deterred.

But three investigations that humiliate and apprehend predators
are not going to solve the problem. Scared by Dateline or not, potena
tial predators will continue to have their fantasies about our children.
The fact that Dateline found this problem to be rather heterogeneous.
affecting indiw'duals ofrnany backgrounds. social strata, and occupa-
tions. testifies to how pemsive this “epidemic" is and. therefore. to
how a ﬁindamentally new direction is needed to curb predation.

Have wt: indeed become so blind to the truth that we no longer
have the ability to critically examine our own responses to social prob-
lems? Do we only know how to condemn and convict, rather than to
innovate and brainstorm? I hope that Americans can pursue both p01.
icies of protecting our children against the dnngeis of cyberpredrition
and making sure that predators’prison sentences are not in vain. Per-
haps when Americans find themselves watching “To Catch a Predator
IV."thcy can search their hearts for a more efficacious solution, rather
than satisfying their eyes and judging from their easy chairs.
