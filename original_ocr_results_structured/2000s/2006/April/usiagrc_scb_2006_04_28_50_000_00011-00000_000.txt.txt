Both the mens and womens track 8c field teams
ﬁnished near the front of the pack in the 2006 Dick
Young Classic last weekend at the Les Duke Track,

The men placed fifth out of 18 teams, and the
women placed sixth out of 17 teams, with many
athletes fiom both teams writing their names into
Gtiunell College's record books.

Nick Fogg 'oo earned Grinnell’s only ﬁrst-place
finish with it time of 33:11 in the IOk run. Willlc
Stewalt '08 claimed the only second-place ribbon
for the Pioneers when he tossed the javelin 182'2,"
rourrhebcst in school history,

Molly Kmlz ’02 was one of thlet: Pioneers to place
thlld In an event with her time of 58. 96' in the 400*
meter dash, good for third best in school history.

The other two Grinnellians taking home white
ribbons were Allison Louthan 08' In the BOO-meter
run and Sara Bmdy '07 in the 5k run. Both runners
who ﬁnished ahead of Brady were unattached, mean-
ing her time of18:53 was lower than any other runner
affiliated with a college.

Bmdy’s performance this season comes as an une
expected boost to the team. She had never run (melt
at any level until this year.

“Anyone can be a distance runner with time," she
said, emphasizing that distanCe running is more about
putting in the time and effort to train than natural
ability.

several other Pioneers chipped in wirh finishes
high enough to score points for the team, including
Scott Schmidt '06.

His pole vault of 13' 5.25" got him sixth place,
but he took home more than a ribbon. During his
first attempt, the pole snapped back towards him and
slapped his forehead, leaving a welt.

I-lis minor head injury aside, schmidr enjoyed the
meet, especially the level of involvement from the rest
otcampus.

“It was nice to see everyone from the college come
out," he said, noting that over 100 Grinnclliatts vols
untecred to help with all ofthe work rhar comes along
with a large track meet.

Two throwers moved near the top of the school
record books over the weekend. Darren McNabb '07

tory and took fifth place at the meet with a toss of
151’. Katie Bartlett Y09 tossed the discus 1297" to also
ﬁnish fifth at the meet and second in the school res
cord books.

son now with just two team meets remaining before
