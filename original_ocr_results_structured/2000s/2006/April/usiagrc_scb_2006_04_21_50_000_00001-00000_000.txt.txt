Grinnell's popular Alternativc Break program, its
frrnding under threat, sent out emails urging pair
ticipants to support the group‘s student initiative,
and tried [0 get a strong showing together at Mon-
day night's initiatives forum. But the proposal that
received the biggest applause at the forum was not
Alternative Break’s or a proposal to curb incidents
of date tape on campus, but an

Awesome."

On Tuesday, strident voters
approved four initiatives, a mix
of serious and frivolous. Three
others, including the name
change, were rejected. Between 878 and 885 votes
were cast on each of the seven initiatives, more than
the 50 percent ofthe campus necessary for irritiatires
to count,

Endorsed were continued Alternative Break fundr
ing, date rape prevention, a proposal for “toaster oven
equality" and a call for beanbag chairs in the new
Campus Center. A proposal for the college to make
“socially responsible” investments and an initiative
criticizing Security’s proposal to place surveillance
cameras around the Campus Center were also not ap-
proved by the necessary tWOrthirds of voters,

Tom Baldwin '08 sponsored the toaster oven inie
tiative. "There were two types ofinitiatives,"Baldwin
said. “There were the ones that took themselves seri-
ously and tried to accomplish things outside of stus
dent reach, and joke types. My aim was to split the
middle. Humorous, but accomplishable."

Tire past years are littered with initiatives that
have been voted on but not enacted by the college,
including repeated calls for a roof over the statue of
Ganesh outside Noyce, Initiatives forum moderator

might have a better chance oflong—term success.

“Usually the initiatives that are acted upon are
smaller things" like toaster ovens and bcairbag chairs,
she said,

The Alternative Break initiative was neither small
nor humorous, but program coordinators say they are
optinr tic about seeing their initiative enactedt The
initiative, which was supported by 902 percent of
voters, called for the college to
recognize Alternative Break as
"an institutional priority in its
budgetary process,"

Alternative Break coors
dinator Kevin Wood '07 said
that the group plans to fol-
low up the successful vote by
working with SGA Presidents
and Vice President-elect Chris Hall ‘06 and Michael
Billups '06, “We're going to try to talk to [them] so
[Alternative Break] can be on the agenda when we
come back in the fall," Wood said.

Willa Campbell '07, another coordinator, agreed
that it was important to follow up on an initiative.
“Any initiative is only what you make of it," Camps
bell said.

Though it showcased the humorous initiatives,
the Monday night forum received praise.

“It seemed like serious debate," said Baldwin.

Patterson agreed. “It was pretty good [given] that
there weren't many controversial issues [like last se-
mester’s CocaeCola boycott proposal]," she said.

The student campaign for Increased Political
Engagement (SCIPE) developed the idea for the for
rtrm last semester with controversy surrounding the
coca-cola boycott.

“We came up with the structured format last 58,
mester because we knew there was going to be the
Coke debate," said Patterson, a leader of SCIPE.

Behind the mysteries of room draw

BY LOLA GARCIA & DAVID MONTGOMERY

Patrick Murray ’08, like every other non-senior,
received his room draw number for next year after
spring break. He immediately began plotting how he
would use his room draw number, 1,010, to get a nice
room.

“I would sayl have a Plan A, a Plan B and a Plan
c," said Murray.

Due to the confusion of the room draw process,
Murray is not sure where he will end up.“1 would say
1 don't really have one plan that's really solid."

This year’s room draw will be Sunday afternoon.

Every year, in the first or second week ofMarch,
cvcry enrolled student who wrll be returning in the
fall is assigncd tr number through a random nrrmbcr
generator. 1,130 students (the 1,430 students Curr
rentiy enrolled, minus the secoridrsemester seniors)
were given random room draw numbers between one
and i,ooo.Atter that the students are grouped firstby
their class standing and their by their randomly as-
signed numbers for the master list.

Because of the random nature ofthc room draw
numbers, and because draw order is determined first
by class standing and then by room draw number, a
student‘s actual number can be a somewhat ambigw
ous reﬂection of what order one draws.

There are 272 rising seniors, of whom approxi-
mately 125 will live on campus and participate in
room draw. Four hundred rising juniors and 384 rise

ing sophomores have room draw numbers
In a newprocess this year-,students studytngabroad
in the fall are asked to partner with someone study
ing abroad in the spring to occupy the same space for
an entire year. One hundred forty-two students are
studying abroad in the fall and 103 in the spring, so a
more realistic number of juniors onrcampus is 292.
This means that the person With the best room
draw number among rising juniors will be about the
145th student to draw. The best rising sophomore will
be about the 4515t student.
For many students, mostly
sophomores and juniors, the

hate everything about living on campus."

Barker was one or 250 students to sign tip for oft-
crrmpus consideration, and one of the 150 students
who were granted permission to escape the dorms.

Eighteen rising seniors were not given permission
and two rising second-semester juniors were not.
