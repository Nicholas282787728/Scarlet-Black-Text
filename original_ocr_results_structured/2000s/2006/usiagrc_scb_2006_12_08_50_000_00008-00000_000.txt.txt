In his tenure at
Grinnell, Green also
saw some things change
for the better. Primarily,
Green was hopeful about
a dying: in tire make-up
of the Student body, and
he hoped the shift might
break down barriers be-
tween groups,

For example, Green felt that the student
body previously might have frightened oihny
approaching conservatives. Although Green
labeled himself radical, he suggests Radian/r

Should we take com—

confront the same issues

did in 1976?

Let me take a cue from Green's style: it’s
nice to know Grinnell hasn’t changed much,
but it is a little disappointing that Grinnell
hasn't changed.

Dear everyone, ,,

When usin your email, dicrcis afiinmon called

grill frigid and' is even unlocked from the outside r , , , is growing weary.
so you don’t need to knock to get someone to let , ‘ , , ,
you in. Thanks buddies. ,
