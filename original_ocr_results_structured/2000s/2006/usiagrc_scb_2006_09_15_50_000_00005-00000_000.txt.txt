A different battle of sexes:
Aiming for equal faculty gender ratios

BY CAITLIN VAUGHAN AND HART FORD-

HODGES
When Janet Davis, Computer Science,
arrived on campus, she quickly realized that
Grinnell had something her past experiences
had notiii high percentage of female faculty

cording to Grinncll’s Addendum to Afﬁn‘nﬂ’
tlvc Action Guidelines.

Departments must not only seek female
and minority candidates through women’s
caucuses and minority groups, but must also
include statements emphasizing a speciﬁc in-
terest in fcmalcjob applicants.

Even when departments are not hiring, the
college will in some cases cicate a position for
a promising female academic.

on Jan. 21, 2000, he said that Grrnnell was
“committed to attracting through our adn‘llS’
srons and hiring decisions those people who
have been traditionally underrepresented in
Amciican institutions."

This leads to different experiences and
awarenesses, as Christine Lemley, Education,
noted. Lcmley said she examines ”classroom
dynamics considering pieces of gender" as she
approaches her reaching. When she walks
into a classroom, she said, "[1 count,] ‘How

said Davis.

The SOrSO faculty gender ratio at
Grinncll is not coincidental, but is part
of the attempts by administrators and de—
partments to recruit promising female and
minority academics for job positions.

Despite these efforts to creme a work-
place with gender equality, there remain
male and female faculty members who
sce sexual discrimination as a problem on
campus and within broader academia,

college, Grnrnell rs legally bound to hire

women, how many men?"

But some say that merely bringing
more women to campus is not enough.

According to Mark Montgomery,
Economics, some students treat male and
female faculty members differently,

“I believe that any woman that steps
Into a classroom to teach has one strike
against her already just because she is a
woman," Montgomery said.

After working in the same depart
ment with his wife for 25 years, he said
he experienced ﬁlbl’hnnd how students

scholarship and teaching skills, rather
than gondci.

Using Davis as an example, Swaltz de
scribed the hiring process: “we didnt go out
saying we wanted to hire a woman. We went
out saying we wanted to find a fabulous com-
puter scientist find if she’s a woman, that’s
great. And we found a fabulous computer sci-
entist who happens to be a women."

But departments do net’s-imply hope to
find a “fabulous" professor who happens to be
a women.

instead, there are highly specified proce
dures dcvclopcd “to lnCIcase the likelihood of

But even with rhcsc provisions, many fac-
ulty members do not see Grinncll as free of
gender discrimination.

”The average differences between mcn
and women do get played out in a classroom,"
Laura Sinnett, Psychology said.

According to Sinnctt, gender remains a
“salient variable," She said, “Gender is one of
the first things we notice about others and all
our stereotypes and our ideas about what men
and women should be are going to influcnce
our reactions and our behavior."

ently. These drfterences, however, are not
always obvious. “You aren’t always aware
of it,” he said.

Monrgomery argues that differences in
treatment are not as apparent outside the
classroom as in it.

“My real feelings about gender in the
classroom have to do with how professors are
treated," he said.“ i really do think that wom-
cn professors have to do more to be accepted
less."
