Seven part-time positions to lose benefits in July

BY DAVID H. MONTGOMERY

In 1991, Christine “Chris” Gaunt started working part time
in Burling Library cataloguing. She only worked din-lug the
school year, and the job amounted to around 750 scheduled
hours per year—well short of the 1,000 hour cutoff necessary
for full benefits, After just three years on the job Gaunt's situas
non improved markedly. The college lowered its qualifications
for beneﬁts to around 700 hours, enabling Gaunt and others to
receive health insurance, tuition remission and other campus
nents ofGiinnell's generous benefits package

“That was the greatest thing that ever hap
pened to me," Gaunt said. Now, she said, she
principally works here for the beneﬁts.

Come this July, Gaunt may have a hard
choice to make. That is because the college
has changed its beneﬁts policy back to the
system of the early ’90s. Gaunt and six other
employees who work part time over the school
year stand to lose their beneﬁts if the college
doesn’t transfer them intojobs with more year-
ly hours.

It is unclear now how many of the seven will retain their
beneﬁts. In the past, many, including Gaunt, have worked hun-
dreds of hours more than their schedule lists. Because health
insurance cannot be granted retroactively, only scheduled hours
count toward eligibility. President Russell K. Osgood said
that the college hopes to recognize that many employees have
worked more hours and change their positions to make those
hours scheduled.

“One ofthe reasons we did this is to look at these positions
and say, are these really ZOshourssasweek positions?" Osgood
said. “Also, some of those people may leave and we may com
bine positions."

The change was effective last July for new hiresThe college
gave current employees an extra year under the old system.

Many of the halfenmc nineernonrh employees affected here
work at their eollegejob primarily for its generous beneﬁts p01.

school, one in the Health Center and two program assistants

Osgood said that under the prevrous system, it was actus
ally Easier for staff to gain beneﬁts than faculty, and that the
administration wanted to change the rules
to set one standard. He‘said the colic did
not consider lowering the faculty elig ility
threshold to match staff.

“You can't have different beneﬁt eligi-
bility rules Within an institution," Osgood
said. “You want to have one standard.
The standard for faculty is basically what
comes out from the underlying law for
pensions."

The Federal Employment Retirement Income Security
Act requires that beneﬁt-giving employers pay retirement
beneﬁts for employees who work more than
1,000 hours per year, Under the new change,
Grinncll will use the 1,000 hour mark as the
threshold for both retirement beneﬁts and
the rest of its beneﬁt package.

Assistant Treasurerjim Mulholland, who
handles beneﬁts for rhe college and played
a central role in formulating the change in
policy, said that the decision was not based
on ﬁnancial imperatives.

“It’s not about whether we’ve got the
money to pay for it or not,”Mulholland said. “It has to do with
whether you’re providing benefits on a reasonable basis."

Mulholland said the old benefit policy was “not appropri—
ate." “You don't provrde beneﬁts that cost more than what you

Making

pay somebody," he said.

one possible consequence of the change will be to make
it more difficult in hire and retain talcnred employees for the
halfetimc, nine-month positions. Gaunt said that for her posi-
tion, a weekend circulation desk librarian, offering beneﬁts is a
“teall smart move."

“[an a nonsbeneﬁt position, you’d probably be hiring and
training someone every year,” Gaunt said.

Mulliollantl agreed that offering beneﬁts for positions that
does not usually receive them was a competitive advantage for
the college, and that it was possible that the college would see
more turnover as a result.

While Osgood and Mulliolland insisted that the beneﬁts
change was the right decision for the college to make, the affect-
ed cmployees see things differently. Mitchell, who has worked
here for 11 years, said he enjoys working in the library and is
hoping that he can keep his beneﬁts andremain here with more
hours. He worried that individual employees like himself and
Gaunt could be forced to leave their positions here.

Gaunt is in a unique position. She spent six months in priSs
on last winter and spring after crossing a police line at a protest
against the Western Hemisphere lnstltutc for Security Co—
operation, formerly known as the School of
the Americas, and was terminated from her
position when her sick leave ran out. After
reconsideration, the college decided to keep
her on thejob, but since returning Gaunt has
been restricted to only her scheduled hours.
As the college looks at which positions regus
larly work more than 1,000 hours ofwork per
year, Gaunt—who in the past has worked as
many as 1,400 hours yearly—could he at a
disadvantage.

She sees the issue primarily in moral terms. “This decision
seems so utterly and totally unsGrinnellslike,"Gaunt said. “It is
not like Grinnell College to take away a beneﬁt package from
employees."
