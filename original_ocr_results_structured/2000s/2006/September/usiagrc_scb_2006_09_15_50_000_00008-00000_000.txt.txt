SPARC-ing dialogue

Last week, every student waited
with baited l7l'.€‘dtl‘l We shredded naps
kins into tiny strips, impatient to hear
the results of SPARC elections?

Unlikely. If
the 13 percént
voter turnout is
any sign, {cw stur
dents even know
that the Student
Publications and
Radio Commib
tee (SPARC) exists.

The committee is independent of
SGA and charged with overseeing stu-
dent media (including the SEER). But
this obscure committee is one of the
most ﬁnancially powerful on campus.
SPARC allocates 353 psi student pcr
scmestcr.That translates to $148,400
each year, or an amount equal to half
of mm budgct. And this money
comes directly from'the Student Ac-
rivities Ft: we pay each year

If wtrc prying for these publicaa
tions, SPARC should be transpllient
and accessible. But lack of visibility
and gencml disinterest made financial
mismanagement possible.

‘Stafwa'd orig] ,

SPARC has been plagued with
financial problems rrr past years Thc
committee historically met once, or
maybe twice, each semester. When
few of us know
that SPARC 8X7
ists, it is nearly
impossible {or
the student body
to affect how its
money is spent.

With only
one returning committeermcmber,we
hope that SPARC will take advan-
tage of their fresh perspectives to fol-
low though on refoims. A committee
that oversees such a large allocation of
funds should exercise that responsibil-
ity judiciously.

Student oversight is essential for
transparency, and communication
is key. The seven SPARC members

Megan Gocring ’08, Traxig Nguyen

responsibility for initiating dialogue
With the student body and maintains
ing an active role on campus.

Socially awkward for minimum wage

I spent the majority of this past summer working
as a cashier at a Safeway supermarket in Poltland,
orc Though 1 could ptctcnd that my tcnurs at this
particular establishment was actually part ofa larger
sociological field study on the circumstances of the
American rniuirnurn»wagc earner. this is not the case,

In reality, 1 unlike
many of true-note ambit
tious peers, failed to plan
ahead for summer by upT
plying for interesting [2*
search opportunities or
meaningful jobs. As a
consequencel was felced
to cam my textbook
money the oldrfushioned way: by sellrng pilrsnlps to
thc cldcily.

Upon completion of a rigorous screening process
rlurt required me to pcrtorru clcmcutnry math and ex-
plain how writing ISeyiagc term papers had prepared
me for the challenges ofa Safeway career, I was of-
fered ‘il position as 11 Cashier, which includes such ext
tiring perks as a snazzy black apron and rrcco to tbc
employee microwave. Needless to say/,1 was ecstatic

As the weeks wore on, however, tlrc job htgnn to
lose ’ liarm.TlioughI did derive a certain amount of
satisfaction from being able to successfully memorize
obs-curt pioducc codesil cven inemmizetl the Clinic
11 digit pioduct codes for certain heavy itemsitl'ie
pitfalls of working with the general public soon began
to get to me.

As an archetypal Grinnclltrn,1 am academically
keen but somewhat lacking rn social graces. As such,l
never really managed to dcvelop the rapport that my

colleagucs seemed to have with many ofout customs
ets, With some effort, I was able to become adept at
rudimentary small talk: “Hi, how are you? Hot today,
isn’t it?" such stilted genulity wrs effective m about
90 percent ofsituations. But, some customers seemed
to lack all knowledge oi’nppiupriatt. professional dis
tance in a supermarket
context.

The most common
norm violators I encoun—
rcrcd wcrc peoplc who
wcre just plain dcp'ress-
ing. As n part ofirlyjob,l
was required to grccr cw
cry customtr 1 madc cyc
conrrcr with 1 usually did so by smiling and saying

lli how are you? crpcctrng that rht person would
rcply Good thanks, or, 1m alright how are you?
sotnc people, though, took this simplc social t‘trrmiln
ity As a legitimate qucstion and responded with COm’
mcnts such as “Bad!" or, “Well, I just buried .r friend,
so not too g "

Interesting, enough,thuugh such pcoplc neglect-
ed the social contention of tcrgniug conrcnrcdncss,
ihcy ncarly Always remembered to rcciprocnrc my
question, As such,l was put in the rtlutiucly awkward
position of having to declare my emotional srnrc to
someone who just returned from a funeral. 1 usually
just mumbled that l was OK, rather (lmn articulat-
ing my full thoughts, which were something along the
lines of"Well,l hate myjob and I feel really awkward
right now, but my friends arc all into, so I guess I’m
dorng tine”

More interesting than the depressing people, but

1 from?

\liil’llli’l

harder to rcspond to, are those who are really freak-
ing weird. These are the folks that feel the need to
articulate completely random ~ind situationally inapr
proptiare thoughts'l‘hcsc run the gamut from mildly-
demented old people who grumble about how the
goveinment is stealing all their money through taxes
(an interesting complaint to hear in a state with no
sales to) to those who simply share way too much
personal information.

One woman came through my line asking its-ht
could return a product she’d purchased m a different
Safeway. lsaid yes, and shc handed me the product.
51 'lng, “Yeah,l bought this butt paste in Seaside, but
it turns out it's the wtong kind of hurt paste!" in a
voice loud enough to be heard seveidl aisles ovel.

HowCVCr, thc prime example of a too much in—
rorrnnrion oddbrii custo not was mined to mc by my
uuclc who also works cashier. Appnrcnrly, an old
man onct approached rlrc (Cl, placed a big of
iicctarincs on the belt, and , ‘Tlicsc nccmril‘ics are

Wliilc Im sure the model cmploycc pur or my
pcrsomlrty would want to respond to such a corurucur

been in that situation myself, I would have said “Oll’l’

1 like to consider my caleel lit Safeway a learning
experience. Most orthc knowledge 1 acquired had to
do with the price of yams and the mystery location of

a right and a wrong kind ofburt pastc.
