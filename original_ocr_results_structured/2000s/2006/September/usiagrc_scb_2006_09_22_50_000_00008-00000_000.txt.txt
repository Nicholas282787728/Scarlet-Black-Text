The mus'c blares with Justin Timberlake‘s “SexyBack.” The lights darting back an’d forth,

the cup in hand almost empty. Everyone‘s moving to the beat, a quick glance at a silhou-
ette, and two pairs of feet stumbling home on a Saturday night maybe morning, it doesn‘t
matter. Heart pumping, face flushed, all sense of reason gone. Whoa! The silhouette is the
kid in Bio class, maybe Lit. He's safe, I know him. Half an hour later, top off, pants unzipped,
the question lingers in the air, “Do you have a condom?"

After a week ofacademic overload, one thing to look forward
to is a stress-free, relaxing, party-hardy weekend. Add a few
drinks, loud music, maybe a round of beer pong and it's unyone's
guess what the night will bring. Whether it he a friendly ﬂing, a
serious monogamous relationship,or a rendezvous with a complete
stranger, sex happens.

With Grinnell famed for its liberal, anythingrgocs attitude
and isolated rural location, the meaning and attlmdes of safe sex
are arguably unique in comparison to other schools.

College students have long been perceived as a particularly pro-
miscuous demographic.Tht: archetypal undergrad pervades all forms
otpopulnr culture; a drunken hooligan, soliciting multiple sexual
partners with apparently little concern for STDs or pregnancy,

According to the Medical Institute
for Sexual Health, Americans between
the ages 18-24 are at the highest risk of
any age group to con—
tract an STD. Over 60
million Americans are
currently infected with
an STD and twosthirds
of all new STD eases
oceuramongindrvitiunls
younger than 25.

The greater risks for young people
stem from a lack of awareness and
education about safe sex practices. And
Grinnellians are no diaerenr. According
to the college's 200472005 Hera/II] Sure
my, a comprehensive survey conducted
among the student body about health
on campus, 69.3 percent of Grinnell
students said rhcy have “little" or “very
little" knowledge of STDs.

Grinnell’s Sexual Culture

Tlmlc no a number orfeatuies par—
ticular to Gilnncll that work to cicatc a
distinctsexualculmle.Giinl‘icllsmdcnts
ale generally considered, to be more
socially liberal than their counterparts
at other schools, and some believe that
this stance fosters an atmosphere that
advocates multiple partners and unsafe
sex,

”The WarstS TD you (an get [at
Grime/I] is a kid.”

Others disagree, arguing that this atmosphere advocates safety
hy virtue of its more accepting quality. “I think maybe we do have
more sex here, but we're louder about it," said Erin Daugherty ’09.
“I think talking about it is what we nced because when we keep
it behind closed doors, misinformation never takes us anywhere
good,"

Students interviewed said the small size ofthc student body and
the apparent campus intimacy that follows encouraged sat’e sexual
practices. “You go to a state school and you hookeup with somebody
you may never see them again,"said Nick sparr ‘09. “[Grrnncll’s
size] sort of reduces that feeling oranonyrniry so you pretty much
know you’re going to see that person the next day You’re more aware
ofthe consequences and you're reminded ofthat daily."

But not all of Grinncll’s conditions are conducive to safe sex.
Students generally agreed that dating was all but absent from
Grinnell’s social scene, with relationships at either of two ends of
the spectrum: the random hookup or the
commuted relationship

Faced with the choice of celibacy or
random sexual encounters, most students
choose the latter. If this propensity trans-
lates to having multiple sexual partners,
risk otndverse consequences
increases.

students also said weekly Harris parties con trihe
uted to the campus' sexual culture. “It seems likc a
lot ofpeople go to Harris with the sole intention of
ﬁnding some to hookup with." said Span, Others
contendthat Hanls interactions are a fact of college
life, aiitl would occur elsewhere ifnot at l-lalris.

According to Shyuan Yang ‘08, “The w
STD you can get [at Grinnell] is a kid.”
In 771: Hell/1}) sin-ray approximately 50 pcrc
of respondents reported using a condom
the last time they had either vaginal or anal
lnteicourse.

The percentage, at ﬁrst glance, appears dist
concertingly low. But in 7712 HAW/Mi Survey nearly
45 percent ofall students identiﬁed themselves as
being in monogamous relationships.’l'hese students
may be using alternative methods ofbirth control,
like the pill or patch.

While the likelihood of pregnancy or STD
contraction is not reduced by virtue of emotional _
attachment, partners in a monogamous relationship are more aw
of each other’s sexual history and thus more comfortable with th
relative risk.

studenrs'views on safe sex during vaginal or anal intercou
did not, however, extend to equally safe habits during oral s
Those interviewed unanimously agreed
that truly practicing safe sex would mean
using some form ofprotcction—condom,
dental dam, or other dcvtcc'while giving
or receiving oral sex, but rhcy said that
using protection during oral sex was rare
at Grinnell This is likely due to the fact
that oral sex carries no risk of pregnancy
and the mistaken belief that STDs can
not be transmitted
through oral sex.

“I should use
condoms when
giving oral sex,
but the risk fat
tors in my head
are so low," said
Daugherty. “And
the taste of latex
sucks." While it is
true that the risks
associated with oral
sex are lower, the
practice is by no
means completely
safe, The Center for Disease Control
(CDC) has placcd the numbel of ncw

high as 1 in 10.
