lesbian relationships ror which pregnancy is
not a {cart According to the CDC, rncrdonce
ofAIDS is 17 times higher among gay men than the general
public.

This fact, according to some snrdents, means gay and bisexual
men on campus have to be more conscious
of sate sex. “If you're gay and you're going
to have anal sex you want to use a condom
because you don't want to die ofAIDS ...."
said Saul St. John ’07. “If you're a woman
and you’re haying sex with a guy and the
condom breaks I imagine there’s more you
can do. lfl’m having sex with another guy
and the condom breaks that’s it."

Among lesbian and bisexual women,
there are tower concerns about STDs because most are in long
term relatioships. according to Kirby Rilmstad ’08. “But the way
the campus is structured. ifyou'rc in a queer relationship, you have
to rely on your own experience,” rather than having easy access to
information about safe sex, she said.

Another important factor contributing to unsafe sex is alcohol
consumption While students interviewed believed the campus
generally practiced safe sex, they thought rhat alcohol could lead to
students not usrng condoms and having multiple partners.

But according to The Hex/ta Savory, only 5 percent of
Grinnellians attributed some of their sexual encounters to the
use ofalcohol.

Students who do not use protection seem to lcarn from their
mistakesAccording to ﬁgures provided by the Health Center and
We Heal/1; Savory, very few snrdcnts rrse Plan B on more than
one occasion (Plan B, also known as the morning iiftcr pill, allows
women to prevent unwanted pregnancy after intercourse).

While condoms are the most widely used method of safe set
on campus, Plan B rs employed as well. “we give it out about 100
times a year," Health center nurse Karen Cochran said. “It's very
effective.”

Cochran said she tries to emphasize safety during visits with
students seeking Plan B,“lfwc do [see a student more than once],
then we get a little more direct about how
they deal with keeping themselves safe," she
said “Very seldom do we have more than two
incidents per person."

Resources on Campus

students are not the only ones talking
about sex: the administration had adopted a
decidedly progressive outlook and prioritizes
providing resources to aid in safe sex practices.
Cochran said responds to the realities afsexunl activity on campus.
“I have to have a pretty open view on it. some people would say safe
sex is no sex,"said Cochran. “Eur I’m very realistic about what safe
sex needs to be in my setting and among the college community."

The report surveyed 16,832 American college
students on their sexual practices and found
that while students believed their peers had
ahnost four sexual partners, the average was
less than two per year.

Saul St. John ’07

The College provides condom dispenscrs in several
dorms, setunl health study breaks, HIV testing and Plan 13.
studenrs rnttzrvicwcd said that, overall, Grinnell adequately
pro , motes safe sex through resources and education. span noted
the availability or condoms on campus: “Every time I see an SA
they’re like,‘Hey, I have condoms. Come by my room or go by the
health oﬁicc, they have condoms there.m
St. John agreed that the health center provided adequate rct
sources and noted that the procedure tor HIV testing was especially
convenient. “[The Health Center does] the 20 minute quick test.
You walk in, get the test, slt there and watch TV for 20 minutes
and then they come in and they say ‘Hey-you've got AIDs,'or ‘Hey,
you don’t have Ale,'said Strlohnr
Cochran said Health Ccntcrtsponsored study breaks are the
most etiicient method of promoting safe sex, “lVly main goal is to
give study breaks and have as many people as possible attendwlh:
lrght—bearted events occur approximately eight times per year
and usually include information about condom usage, STD
transmission, Plan B and HIV testing
“We've done condom sculptures and
condom races in the past, and students
seem to have a good time during it,”
Cochran said. “This rs informa~
tron but also adds a little bit of
a relaxed atmosphere so I think
people out of this setting will
ask more questions and nraybe
feel free to COIHC over herc and
get the frce condoms and know
that we’re usettfrlendly.”
Sort, however, was skepti—
cal of the efﬁcacy of the study
breaks, noting studenrs‘ apathy.
“They are pretty well publicized,but
I don't think people care enough," she
said. "They don't go to the snrtly breaks
because they don't think they’ll help,
which is lame,"
More often, stu—
dents go directly to
tlle I'lcrilth Center.
Cochran said that
students arc Mt
sci c about
their needs,
“Our klle here
are pretty out-
spoken about
what they want and what they're
concerns ntc,"shc said.“'lhcy’llcome
in and say, ‘I need to see a mental
health therapist,’ or, ‘1 need Plan B
today: or, ‘Do you guys do pregnancy
tests here?”
Cochran added that students have no
reason to {col intimidated. “I think that
students for the most part fccl comfortable
coming hcrc,"shc said. “Jean [King] and l
are not very scary"
stlohn agreed.“l am perfectly comfortable
walking into the Health Center and saying
just about anything," he said, “I think that
most people have had it beat into their heads
that the Health Center is kind of there so
thatyou can go in and , oshock the lirrle
old ladies with your sex lilo" (though that
rarely works).
_ While most students relt p vely
towards the schools' efforts to provide
resources, some students have cxplcssed
concern that the Health Center rs closed on
the weekends,when Plan B may be needed.
Cochran said that technically this should
not be an issue. “The morning after pill has as
72-hour grace period, so the only time we run
into grcnr problems is rvhcn we have a three
day weekend," she said

While resources may be available and students are aware ofsafe
