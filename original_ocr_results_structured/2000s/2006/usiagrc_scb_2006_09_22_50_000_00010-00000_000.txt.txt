Iivtrv Wodiicsdiw evcrnng on rhc second
ﬂoor of the Joe Ros field '25 Center, a room
is filled with laughter. This is where the Inr
tornational Student Organization (150) wel-
coincs everyone on campus to enjoy a meal
while learning about cultures across the globe.

ISO seeks to cncornp all nationalities
and promotc international understanding;
however one nationality is often missing.

“They tell me, why do intcinational stu-
dents sit together in the cafeteria?” said Janet
Alexandei, Director of Inteinationnl Student
Scrwccs “And I tell them, why do Aineiican
students do it too?"

This typical scene in the cafeteria reﬂects
a situation that is gaining attention on cam-
pus, srudent Affairs is conducting .i study to

tween international and domestic students.

This is also one ofthe main concerns ofInr

cording to 150,75 percent orthe .nemhers nie

past it has been populai with both intei nntiotr
al and domestic students.

However, these efforts do not seem to draw
180 much closer to its goal of meiging the
two sides.

Blair Brown '07, former prcsident of ISO,
said that when people would tome to events,
“the inrtrnirionils would sruy in one group,
and [lit Americans would be in their own

“I have learnt so much about how hi5y the
world really is but at thc same time how small

and ﬁnally the presidency

ISO represents 60 nae

multi-cultural groups exist

struggling for the attention
of domestic students.

Shc explained that this is caused by subtlc

the problem actually is.

“Of 162 international students, 42 are
ﬁrst-year students who can’t choose their
roommates and 19 live offcampus,"Alcxander
said. “That leaves 101 international students
who can choose their roommates. Ofthese, 83
choose to live with American students." She
also stressed the role of ISO as an “umbrella
