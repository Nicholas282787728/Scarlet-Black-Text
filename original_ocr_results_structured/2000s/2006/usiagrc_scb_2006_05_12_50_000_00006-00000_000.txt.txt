A warrior from another planet

Night Watch (PG)

Mglvr Wire/1 is an entertaining, mod»
ern take on fantasy horrorThe first ora
trilogy otmovies based on a book series
by Russian author Sergei Lukyancnko,
it tells the story of the uneasy peace
between the forces of Light and Dark—
ness. The two sides have maintained
a delicate balance since their leaders,
Gesser (Vladimir Menshov) and Zn-
vulon (Viktor Verzhbitsky), formed a
truce long ago to end a bloody battle
between their armies. However, a pow~
crful Other has arrived who may tip the

scales in favor of one side or the other, ,

and Anton (Konstantin Khabensky)
must mce to find him before the vams
pires and witches orDarlsness do.

Though the movie was shot on a
budget of $4 million, its cinematograr
phy rivals that of the most expensive
American blockbusters. It is packed
with stylistic ﬂair and surprising vi»
sual tricks that keep the intensity high
throughout The camera is occasions
allya bit too frenetic, but for the most
part it lends a very modern feel to what
might otherwise seem an old-fash-
ioned tale.

It is obvious that the story is better
suited to a longer book format than a
movie. The plot sometimes gets lost in
the overwhelming amount of mythol-
ogy and symbolism packed into the
movie’s two—hour running time. Many
events and characters are simply not
explained, leaving the viewer confused
about what is happening. A little less
content and a little more exposition
would make the movie a lot less bewil-
dering for viewers unfamiliar with the
book trilogy.

Still, none of these problems pier
vents Nay/n Watt/J from being an eats
citing and clever horror movie. if you
allow yourself to be taken along for
the ride, you will find yourselt holding
your breath as Anton and his comrades
square off against the warriors of Dark
ness.

warrior, Lafcadia (Irfan Khan), and his
son Katiba (Punt Chibber). Lafcadia
works with other ﬁghters {oi the war-
lord to punish local residents to coerce
them to contribute money and food
to the local warlord. Tlrey behead or
tortuie those who come to the warlord
empty-handed and mercilessly raid vils
lages.

Kariba is training to become a wai—
lord's mercenary, like his father, and is
friends with a peasant girl from a lo-
cal village.The theme ofviolcncc in the
film becomes more complex when the
warlord orders the warriors to punish a
village for failing to pay enough tribute.
Tire warrior recognizes a small girl he
is about to slaughter as a companion of
his son and has an epiphany about the
immorality of this violence against the
weak.

Tire film does not focus upon this
instantaneous epiphany but rather the
later ramifications, After realizing his
immoral doings, Latcandia must go on
a sojourn to escape.

The warriors sojourn is as much a
mental journey as a physical one. He
must evade other warriors, but he must
also come to terms with the grave injus-
tices he has done throughout his life

During his journey he meets other
immoral characters who are judged in
a similar manner. One character the
warrior meets is an orphaned teenagei
named Riaz (Noor Mani), who sur-
vives by stealing and betraying people
he knows and works for, but also steals
from the wealthy to give to peasants.
The ﬁlm conveys a powerful message
that there is truly no good or evil in the
universe and that people often just do
what they have to or what they are told
to.

I had planned for this review to
be another love letter to Cillian Muir
phy, who really, in my eyes, can do no
wrong. Lets recap: he's Irish, hes tall
and skinny, he‘s somehow both unas-
suming and intense.

But I think this time around. he
should be congratulated on his acting
skills, because it was not Cilluln on the
screen at all but Kitten, the soft-spo-
ken transvestite who sashays starry-
eyed through the streets orlr-eland and

Kitten, abandoned at birth, develr
ops an attachment in his youth to old
film stars and attractive women‘s cloth-
ing, He writes dirty stoiies about his
own conception for his catholic school
composition class, informs the princir
pal he’d like to be called Kitten instead
of Patrick and asks the priests about
getting a sex change.

Until then, everyone had looked the
otherway from his softly curling hair
and ﬂared pants, but at this point, his
foster mother gives up and kicks him
out. He hitches a ride with a rock band,
falls hard for the lead srnger, who puts
him up in a trailer by a beautiful lake,
where it just so happens lRA operatives
come to stash their guns. From here.
kitten meets up with different people,
gets a gun held to his head, almost gets
blown up in a London club, gets beaten
up by police ofﬁcers and works at a
peepslrow.

That said, this is the feclrgood
movie of the year. Kitten also keeps up

earnestly searches for his mother, who
he calls the Phantom Lady

Normally, ifwe want a movie about
lrislr life during the struggles, it's gar
mg to be bloody and bitter And a good
gay plot is going to be about struggling
against an unaccepting society.

Break/rut on Plum touches on these
themes, but makes rhenr pleasant. Kite
ten never raises his voice, never gets
mad about his outsider status and looks
pastjust about everyones mean exterior
to find the best in them. And everyone
sees it too—it would be cheesy if Kitten
wasn’t so damn sincere. And that sincere
ity makes the optimism so believeablc.

Im not going to say this film has a
great,coinpelling plot ltamblesthroiigli

Kitten is not only goigeous, but good
