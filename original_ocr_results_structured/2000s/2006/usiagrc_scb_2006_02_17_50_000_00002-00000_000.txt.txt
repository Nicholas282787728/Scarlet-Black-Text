Students to learn
to run meetings,
handle conflict

Conﬂicts on campus may be a bir more moderate
after this weekend. _

On Saturday, Feb-18, professional mediaror Annie
Tucker will come to Grinncll to perform a thrcerhour
Meeting Facilitation Training at the Chrystal Center.
She hopes to teach students how to lead meetings in
a productive and respectful manner.

Tucker, who is director ofthe Iowa City notrforn
profit group Mediation services of Eastern Iowa, has
been a mediator for 12 years. She earned her Masters
in Conﬂict Resolution from Antioch in 2001. She
uses activities, group discussions, role-playing and
other techniques in her training.

"The goals are the same for a facilitator as for a
mediator: to better understand nature of a conﬂict,"
she said. “1 think most people are uncomfortable
when a conﬂict comes up, when people are emotional
about their differences. One of the goals is to under-
stand why and how that happens.”

Val Vetter, coordinator of the Peace Studies Pres
gram, is responsible for bringing Tucker to campus.
She says many students have reported feeling their
voices are not being heard in meerings ofvarious cams
pus organizations, creating the need for this training.
Vetter met Tucker while working at the Iowa Peace
Institute.

Linn Davis '08 first suggested the training to Vets
tar as one of the leaders oftho Student Campaign for
Increased Political Engagement (SCIPE), as well as
a member of the Peace Studies Program. Davis says
he noticed that many studentrrun meetings “weren't
being run in the best way." He added that “running a
good meeting takes a lot ofsltill and experience,"

The trainings usefulness is not necessarily limited
to running meetings, says Tucker. “When you learn
this, it’s a transferable skill for the rest ofyout life. It
helps you be more comfortable when conﬂict comes
up in your personal life"

Four FrP protesters arrested

Four Grinncll student environmental activists were arrested Sat-
urday evening at Merle Hay Mall in Des Moincs, following a protest
targeting rhe clothing retailer Victoria‘s secrer.The students, Heidi
Conner ’09, Holly Edlin ’08, Sam Gault '09 and Britta Nordberg ’09,
will be arraigned Monday.

The four declined to comment on their arrests until after the
trial has concluded.

The protest ms organized by the Grinnell chaprer of Free the
Planet (FTP), of which the four students are members. The protest
was part of a National Day of Action against Victoria’s Secret, coorr
dinated by the national environmental group Forest Ethics.

Victoria's Secret is a major producer of paper catalogs, and envi-
ronmentalists claim that most of the paper the company uses is made
from pristine forests in Canada and the southern United States.

Limited Brands, the parent company ofVictoria's Secret, coun~
tcrs that the company is introducing more recycled paper.

"We have initiated a major effort to use more postrconsumer
reeyeled content paper, reduce direct mail and conduct more eerie
cicnt targeted mailings of other materials sent to customers," said
Anthony Hebron, VlCCTpIesidcnt for external communications.

The protest follows a training session conducted on campus two
weeks ago by former Grinnell student Shayna Ortman, now an or—
ganizer for Forest Ethics. Ortman was one of three FTP members
arrested in April 2003 for civil disobedience against Office Max.
