As Patrick Lyons Y09 walked to the mound
in thc cighrh inning, he felt the weight ofhis
team on his shoulders. A victory would secure
a berth in the Midwest Conference tournat
ment. Two men stood on base with one out
and the tying run on deck. But Lyons pulled
through, allowing only one run in the inning
and the Grinnell oﬂ’ense scored
four runs in the following int
ning to secure a place in the
tournament.

The Pioneers are the num-
ber two seed out of the South
Division and will face Ripon,
the number one seed from the
North Division.

The tournament appearance
for Grinnell today and tomors
row will be the school’s ﬁrst since 2001 and
comes on the heels of doubleheader splits
against both Monmouth and Illinois College
earlier in the week.

In game one against Monmouth, Sam
Eaton ’07 tossed six shutout innings to lead

Grinnell to a 20 victory Kevin Byrne ’06

Daniel Clark ’08 had two hits and an RBI
in the second game, but it msn’t enough as
the Fighting Scots touched up Gary Kahn '09
for three runs in the eighth to down Grinnell
5-3.

A loss ro Illinois College
in the ﬁrst game of the week’s
second doubleheader left the
Pioneers only one shot to earn
a berth in the playoffs,

"We put ourselves in a
must-win situation,” said Rick
Berdelle ’09, who pitched two
and twmthirds innings and 31,
lowed one run in the decisive
second game.

Fellow freshman Gary Kahn ’09 started
the game and pitched four and twmthlrds int
nings, giving up three runs and earning the
win. He was relieved by Berdelle, who was
later relieved by another freshman' in Lyons.
The three freshmen combined to hold the Big

Blue to four runs on 14 hits en route to an 11-
4 Pioneer victory.

Lyons was hesitant to take credit for the
win despite entering into a pressure situation
and holding Illinois College scoreless through
an inning and a third. “It helped [that] our
team scored a lot of runs early." he said.

Freshmen also took on a lot of the run
production, as shortstop Ben Mendoza ’09
went 35 at the plate and knocked in two runs.
Catcher Mark Wilcox '09 chipped in another
two RBI on 2-4 hitting. Seniors Byrne and For
ter Leo each made it on base three times, with
Byrne going 374 and Leo hitting a single and
taking two walks.

Berdelle felt the win showed the team's (6*
silience in bouncing back after a disappointing
slump in the middle of the season.

“We were really good in Florida but then
we had a lull. But since the lull, we’ve gotten
better,” he said.

The Pioneers will look to continue their
improvement today. They opened the tour—
nament at 10 this morning against Ripon' in

'Galesburg, 111., and will play their second game

mlp.m.

Men’s golf has best MWC finish in years

BV KEVIN BYRNE

The men’s golf team had one of its most successful Midwest
Conference Championships in recent history last weekend.
Jack Kennedy ’06 led the Pioneers with a fourthtplacc ﬁnish,
and the Pioneers placed fourth out of nine teams at the Aldeen
Golf Club in Rockford, Ill. Gtinnell improved their team score
each round during the 54»hole event and got solid petfotmanc~
es out of all of their golfers.

“As golfers we always feel like we could have played a little
better," said Ben Johannsen ’06, “but this is the first year since
I have been here that we have been pretty pleased with our
performance. Our fourth»place ﬁnish doesn‘t reﬂect that our
team had the second-best score on the last day of the touma

ment or thatjaek ﬁnished fourth as an individual. Both are big
accomplishments for the team."

Kennedy shot 76-75-80 for a tournament total of231. Mi-
chael lnman '09 carded a 240 to place 11th and Johannsen shot
244 to ﬁnish 16rh.Trek Langenhan ’07 ﬁnished in a tie for 26‘“
with a total of 254 strokes, Ryan Long ’08 tied for 28m place
with a 255 and R] Roewe '09 rounded out the scoring with a
threetround score onS9 and a tie for 32‘” place.

The parity at the top half of the conference was reﬂected
by Grinnell finishing closer to ﬁrst place than fifth. They beat
fifrhrplace carrou by 37 strokes but were just 28 strokes offof
Knox College’s championship pace and just 12 strokes behind
Lawrence for thiid.

“For us to go out there for three straight days and have four
to five solid scores each day was sort of unprecedented until this
year, It was a great team effort all around," said Roewe, adding
rhat the course was not easy. "If the Pioneers are to perform at

‘the same level next year they will need to replace some valuable

members Kennedy and Johannsen are among those graduatt
ing, along with Wes Barber, Rob Pedersen and Jeffery Wallace.
The importance of the entire team ms not lost on the gradu-
ating seniors, and they realized that next year’s club will be in
good hands."Every player was playing their best golfby the last
day of the season,” said Kennedy. “Our freshman showed what
this program can be in the next three years. That's all we can
