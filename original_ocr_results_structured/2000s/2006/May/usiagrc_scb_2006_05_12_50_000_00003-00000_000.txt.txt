Class of 2010

BY EMILIA GARVEV

Four members of the class onOIO will wind their
way up to Grinnell from Alabama, up from zelo last
year. The 55 students from Illinois who have accepted
Grinnell’s offer of admission will have an easier time
ﬁnding a ride home when fall break comes around.

Admissions deposits should be postmarked by
May 1, but don’t always arrive until well into May. As
otMay s, 414 students had made their deposits—21
mo than this time last year. "We like to have about

het deposits," said Jim Sumner, dean otAdmisr
sion. “So we‘re right on target."

So tar, despite some policy changes, there are not
many big surprises with the incoming class of 2010.
The majority of students, about 223, will come from
the Midwest.

The college might still be waiting on students
who live further away. International student numbers,
speciﬁcally, may see some changes as transcontinenr
tal mail trickles in. Although the new needrsensitive
policy for international applicants meant that fewer
international students were admitted, as of May 8, the
number of international students who have accepted
their offer of admission is only down one from 30
to 29. “The preliminary indication is pretty encour-
aging," said Sumner. “The international deposits will
take a little longer to com: in.The number ofinternar
tional students was over 40 last year and will be over
40 this year."

Grinnell accepted more domestic students otcol»
or than in any previous year, but as of May 8, three
fewer domestic students of color had accepted than
last year. “Since we admitted more students ofcolor,"
said Sumner, “we’re still optimistic on that front."

takes shape

incoming students must make their decision on a
number ofﬂictors, including ability to pay. This year,
Grinnell began decreasing merit aid and working to
make need-based ﬁnancial aid better. “We know that
we’ll be giving less merit aid by at least a few hundred
thousand dollars," said Sumner. “This is a positive
thing for needier students."

Although,_t_he class demographic won't be com~
pletely clear ui'itil the fall, students were eager to save
their spot. once the college receives all deposits from
admitted students, it turns to the wait list to fill out
the class. Sumner said that because more admitted
students have sent in their deposits, it is possible that
not as many wait-listed students will be accepted this

car.
y As the months lead up to the arrival of the class of
2010, things may change. “Until students are actually
here, and register, there are always little shifts," said
Sumner.

Admission measures the success of the yearlong
efforts by yield and retention. Yield is the percentage
of admitted students that accept, and retention is the
number who remain after their initial enrollment. “It
doesn’t do any good ifstudents get here and say, holy
mackerel, what is this?" said Sumner. “We’ve put out
a new Iowa-focused viewbook and students seem to
be responding."

Grinnell works to attract a diverse, far-reaching
student body, one group will have the shortest disc
trince to go. Though students come from Oregon,
New York City, Greece and Thailand, one student
population has seen a notable rise from last year. The
class of 2010 will have about 51 Iowan students, up
from 35 in the class of2009.

Police search
Dibble Annex

Beginning at 1. 30 p. m yesterday, the Dibble An-
nex was visited by Grinnell security, Vice President
for Student Services Tom Crady, Dean for Student
Life Jennifer Krohn, CND RLC Stephanie Mastai
and the Grinnell police.

In the next three hours, every room on the ﬂoor
was searched ‘use of an incident that ﬂoor resin
dent Tim B’ ion ’08 called “a misunderstanding
about a poster."As of press time, neither the Grinnell
police nor Security had published their report of the
incident. No arrests have been made.

Billion said that when the police arrived, they
asked permission from those on the ﬂoorihim and
Michael Inman ’09—to search their rooms. Both con-
sented. The police then proceeded to search the two
rooms and then on a security warrant, the rest of the
rooms in the hall.

Floor resident Jacob Simmering ’09 said that “the
stuff they did ﬁnd was minor." However, none of the
floor members would say what was conﬁscated other
than a camera that had been checked out from the
AV Center. All the members ofthe ﬂoor will be meets
ing with Crady tomorrow morning.

Members of the ﬂoor were upset that the situation
had risen to the level that police would be involved.
"It got blown way out of proportion," Billion said. “I
think it’s kind of sad the way that it went straight
to the police instead of through normal self—gover-
nance."
