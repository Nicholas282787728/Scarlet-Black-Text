How to deal With distress

l’ve always been an avid reader of advice columns.
Growing up, 1 found reading thc questions sent into
Abby, Ann Landers and even the mascot of Boyi Li 2
magazine, Pedro the Burro, extremely entertaining:

“My sex life with my husband is nonexistent, and
Hans, the Swedish guy from work, seems interested
Should I stay with my man, or sample the smorgase
bord?”

“My bo riend is addicted to porn. How do 1 get
him to quit?

“Dear Pedro, what is the easiest way to tie a bOWT
string knot?"

Then, entertainment aside, 1 would pour over these
columns and try to find connections between the prob-
lems strangers shared and thosc of my own, in some
fanatical attempt to pull an easy solution out of my hat
of despair. I was constantly ,
irked when taking colum-
nistsY advice never drastir
Cally improved my quality
oflife, albeit I learned more
about knot tying.

After 10 years of read
ing such columns l've
learned that very rarely can
life-altering advice be dispensed in a brief paragraph.
There are no quick fixes. No magic buttons or wands
exist to instantly eradicate unpleasantncss.

Which is rather unfortunate, because post spring
breakl find myself re-immersed in the grind, looking
for my own solution for dealing with too many things
to do.

I’ll admit that my first instinct upon coming back
to school to face the workI had neglected over break in
order to Watch the My BAX! Frizmi’r Wedding marathon
on TBS was to hide under my giant green coat with
the hope that somehow, ifl stayed hidden long enough,
everything would be okay.

Luckily, it didn't take me long to realize that such
a tactic would be rather unproductive And for me to
remember some of the coping methods I've used in the
past would redirect my worries and disappointments
into something more positive

While Grinnell’s mental health center is a fantastic
resource, sometimes I don’t have the time or volition to
go. In such cases, 1 like to take my mental well—being
into my own hands.

For me, the symbolic removal of aggravation from
my life can be quite useful in turning a bad mood
around.

The next time a negative mood takes you hostagc,
I suggest going outside and ﬁnding a pretty leaf, Use
a ballpoint pen to mark on the leaf everything that is
currently bothering you.

Write down the class that is less than inspiring, the
grad school that chose not to accept you, the name of
that certain boy or girl who seems to be having difi‘lr
culty realizing how wonderfully amazing you are.

Fill up the leaf with all your worries, your concerns,
your fears.

When the leaf is full,wait for a nice gust ofwind to
pass your way, and then rip up the leaf. 1 find it’s helpful
to ﬂail your arms around and yell during the ripping.
The emotional release is intensiﬁed greatly that my.

Watch the tiny pieces ﬂutter amy from you, taking
your worries and negative energies along.

lfit is a \vindless day, and the learpieces rail straight
down and cnshroud your toes (an action which symbol-
ically suggests that your troubles will continue to weigh
you down), consider locating a body ofwater. (I suggest
Arbor Lake or the country
club’s artiﬁcial pond). Drop
your leaf pieces in the was
ter, and watch your troubles
ﬂoat away.

It's simple. It's free.A.nd
it feels oh so good.

A similar tactic We used
to reduce negative energy
in my life is blowing bubbles. Unt’orurnately, a disturb-
ing 86 percent of students have a college experience
completely devoid of bubble blowing. Don't become a
statistic.

Instead, if you're feeling upset, get your hands on
some bubble solution and one of those Little plastic
wands.

Then put it all in a bubble and blow it away.

so-so grade on paper Blow it away.

Moroccan Cous Cous in the dining hall. Blow it
away.

Fear of the future. Blo‘w it away

Girl/Boy who still doesn’t realize how wonderfully
amazing you are. Blow it away.

Then, after you’ve had adequate bubble time, get
back to living.

Because again, there is no miraculous or quick solu-
tion to all the difficulties and worries that plague us.

It is pretty blatant that leaf ripping and bubble
blowing will not literally make all your problems disape
pear. And that after the leaves are torn up and bubbles
blown, life will still have to be dealt with.

We can't make all the icky things go away.

But we can aim to reassess our attitudes so we are
in a better state of mind to effectively deal with the
icky things.

Leaves and bubbles help meThey might help you.
too.

And ifthey don't, well, you could always ask Abby

Sindenltll-Id

Malarkey, why are you dressed up?

“Why are you dressed up,>"l ﬁeld this question ev-
ery few days. Even after two years, many students at
Grinnell are shocked thatI
went dress shirts and ties to
class, My style goes against
the prevailing fashion at
Gi'inncll, a fashion based
on sportswear that does not
villorizc putting effort into
getting ready for class.

It seems to me that Grinneilians, who like to call
themselves noneconforniists, in fact conform to a uni-
form e tennis shoes, sindals,jcans, swcarpants, hoodics,
sweatshirts, jerseys, trshiris and baseball caps. Messy,

unwashed hair. It is very a la mode to brag about how
little time it takes to get ready, some students even
come to class in sleepwear,
pajamas or sweatpants.

And if, by chance, 1
compliment someone on
her shirt, she takes the de—
fcnsivc.“1t's my last piece or
clean laundry," “1 found it
in a dumpster" (Serge Gian
chetti ’06 recalled these lines). Such comments show
that studcnrs, by and large, want to seem as irthey put
no thought whatsoever into their dress.
