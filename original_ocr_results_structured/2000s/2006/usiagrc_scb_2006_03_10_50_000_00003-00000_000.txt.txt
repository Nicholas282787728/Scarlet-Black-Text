Mixing Bush

and biology

Professors often bring their political views into classroom discussions, to illus-
trate ideas or just make jokes. Does this create a hostile learning envionment?

BY ABBY RAPOPORT

Rachel Fields ’09 began her Intioduction to Sociology class
expecting class debate and an emphasis on analysis. She found a
professor who willingly argued with and debated students with cone
servative opinions.

Fields sat in class as the professor openly told students with difr
ferent opinions that they were wrong and their positions stupid.
Her professor found “it hard to accept that students have a different
opinion than she does,” said Fields. Fields became so worried about
disagreeing with the professor that she stopped raising her hand if
she thought she would be at odds with the professor.

The question ofwhether liberal professors are accepting ofother
points of view has been raised nationally by Daniel Horowitz, a
conservative political activist. Horowita, along with other Repube
liean leaders, has traveled across the country promoting his “Bill of
Academic Rights," which argues for equality between liberal and
conservative viewpoints.

Few dispute that Grinnell professors are predominantly liberal
and aren't shy about expressing their personal views. “The average
[opinion] is certainly more to the left in general," said Jim swarta,
vice president for Academic Affairs. The effect this has on class-
room discussion and the educational process is less evident.

Alan schrift, Philosophy, thinks that the goal of those attacking
politics in the classroom isn't objectivity at all, but instead making
higher education more conservative. Horowitz is “turning political
discourse to where he wants ll’Wl‘ilCh is somewhere between the
right and the far right, ”said Schrift.

Swartz said that professors can use their political opinions “as
long as it isnt asserted' in a way of this' is what others need to think’
it’s not a problem."

some professors, like Schrift, think objectivity is impossible in
teaching. “We’re always affected by our own politics," said Katya
Gibel—Azoulay, Anthropology. “There’s no syllabus that does not in
some way reﬂect a person’s political predisposition."

To counter this subjectivity Amulay tries to acknowledge her
biases, as well as those of the
class readings. “In my celecr
tion of syllabi, I make an ef~
fort to find material that is
analytically sophisticated
rather than polemic,” she said,
"and where the politics of the
writer are made clear to the
reader."

Not all professors are so
up from about their biases.
“I dont make a bi point of
saying here i stand in politir
cal issucs]," said Jack Mutti,
Economics.

According to Mutri, ecor
nomics presents a specific
world view, so during class
disagreements, he asks, “Are
[the students] disagreeing about how the economy works, or are
they disputing value judgments?"

The key for Mutti is to distinguish between teaching facts and

expressing opinions. Im not trying to convert people, Mutti said
"I don’t try to come up with a final conclusion."

Gibel Azoulay tries to temper personal attacks in her class by
focusing on reasoning and substantive defense. “1 do my best at the
beginning of the semester [to say] thatl am going to discourage
opinions and emphasize understanding,” she said.

Regardless oftheir personal politics, all three professors felt that
current politics made good examples to help students relate to abr
stracr concepts. 1 dont find any problem with using political ex-
amples, said schrift who often compares current political ideology
to much older philosophical ideas.“I don’t steer away from political
events at all."

Cat Pietro ‘08 has taken
multiple classes with Sclirift
and says this use of politics
in class can be helpful. "He
does not state a political
opinion generally however if
it relates to philosophy and if
he can use politics as an exr
ample, he’ll bring something
in," she said.

Some students agree that this is helpful. “I actually enjoy it
when we can relate what we're doing in class to current events," said
Freedil Brook’07.

Classes in the hard sciences represent more politically neutral
territory. “It’s not somcrliingl really talkabotit,"saitl Damon Spayde,
Physics. spayde cannot remember any student making a political
point in class, although he occasionally does make a political joke.
“I“ do make a comment, there’s usually chuckling," he said.

”We had a tonservah‘ve kid

in (lass, and when hed say

someything, [the profeiior

wou/d]ju5t5hur him down,”

professdrs"

As opposed to some disciplines in the social sciences, spayde
believes all students should feel comfortable in science classes. “We
deal in physical reality,” he said. “We have enough to do in the class
room just teaching our subject matter.“

Gibeerzoulay does not worry that students in disagreement
will be less inclined to participate. If they're paralyzed by feeling
intimidated, they can’t learn," she said.

Dilara Yarborough ’06, who has taken class with Gibel Azous
lay, believes Gibel- -Azoulays
willingness to acknowledge
her own biases improves
students’ abilities to find
their own opinions. ”The
professors who have been
the most open [about their
political positions] have led
the best dialogues," she said.
“Professors who are afraid to
go out on a limb ...are not as

’lffsrudehlsl are para/ﬂed by
fee/[rig intimidated then they
can’t/earn.”
—Katya Gibeerzoulay,
Anthropology

able to do that."

Schrifr echoed these sentiments, stating that the primaryjob of
a professor is to upset the thinking of students and force them to
question their positions.

Swartz hopes that by raising their own positions, professors also
encourage their students to speak freely "1 hope people feel free to
challenge and say what they think," he said.

Despite these intentions, examples like Fields class imply that
some students find the politicization of the classroom to be prolr
lematic. According to Fields, when a student is in the minority, he
or she is far less inclined to participate in class dialogue. “You don't
want to risk being the kid in class everyone is looking at and looking
down on," she said, noting that she did not raise her hand ifshe did
not think her professor would agree.

Others, like Francis O’Rourke ’08, have had similar experiences,
even in English classes. “Whenever I read a book with a dumb leads

, i,” use ,- er, 1 always dread the inevi-
table Bush reference' in class,
he said

Fields worried that stur
dents and professors assume
that others always agree and
do not know how to respond
to those who disagree. “Peer
plc think, ‘Oli, I’m so liberal
and really dccepting,’ except
everyone who’s conservative
is wrong" she said.

Students who agree with
a professor’s politics can still
ﬁnd their mention uncoi-nr
fortable. “The politics ofmost
Grinnellians are tcrribly lib—

” M “l ”1,: écA
era] and unifoim and insenr

oli tics
sitive," O’Rourke said. “Even

though 1 am somewhat liberal, I get annoyed by it."

Uday Chandra loo sees students as more a problem than faculty
in terms of homogenoiis opinions. “There isn’t a lot of ideological
diversity on campus among students,"he said. "That's a much bigv
ger concern for me [than professors politics]."

The dynamic between professor and student can create difficulr
ties, acording to Fields, who thinks that professors should be aware
of the influence they have over students. “A lor of people take the
professor’s word as law,”she said.

Yarborough disagrees, arguing that debate with professors imr
proves her own critical thinking. “Anytime someone who I respect
intellectually has a different opinion than I do, it makes me think
more critically about my own position. And that’s never a bad
thing,” she said.

Chandra also finds disagreement between professors and stur
dents useful. “Grinnell students aren’t easily intimidated," he said,
and he believes they can actively debate with their professors.

Brook, Fields and Yarhorough agree that the professor’s attitude
towards discussion can determine whether openness about their por
iitical positions helps or hurts class discussion. “Even my professors
who do tend to be more vocal have demonstrated that they know
when to stop," said Brook.

Using politics in class can be effective for many students."1 don’t
think it detracts from the atmosphere of the classroom in anyway,”
said Pierre about her experience in Schrifts class.

Fields has had vcry different experiences in her classes. we had
a conservative kid in class and when he'd say Something: [the profuse
sor would] Just shut him down, she said

0 Rourke agrees that conservatives do not have equal voice at
Grinnell. “IfI were conservative, I would feel" .'5ilcnced," he said.

Many professors and students see political biases as incvitablc
and better stated than iinspokcn. “All learning is political," said Yarr
borough. “You may as well acknowledge it."

I was a child when my mother managed to get
a visa for me to go to Hong Kong. I was 11 at the
time. The visa was actually for someone else but we
scratched out the other person’s nameand put my name
on it. The visa wasn’t free; for 20 years they extorted
money from my mother. And my mother couldn’t
leave because
then they couldn’t
collect money
Experiences like
this, either they

I learned to cope

always knew that I’d be landing on my feet.

Well, I didn't set out to become a human rights
activist. It is something that happened In 1972 I
went to China. [The Chinese government] obviously
wanted me to see the best of China. But what I saw
I had to
make a decision at that time, whether I was going to
believe my own eyes or believe my ears and I decided
to believe my own eyes. lfyou decide to believe your
own eyes you have to do something about horriﬁc
conditions. And it is your country, too. You cannot
just sit on your hands and do nothing

The first major success I had was at the UN. in

knew about the structure of power in China I was
at that time teaching in Hong Kong and my students
were gaing up to Beijing to protest in solidarity with

because I knew that the Chinese government [was

...To cut the story short we won. Unheard of, the first

Essentially, the U. SrChina policy siviugs between

of those solutions will work You cannot talk China
into changing voluntarily, but you can defeat their
ideas. You don't defeat them militarily: you defeat
their ideas.
