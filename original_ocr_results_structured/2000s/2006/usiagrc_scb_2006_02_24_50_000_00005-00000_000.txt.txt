Daniela, a ﬁfth-grader from Mexico who
attends Grinnell Middle School, answered eas-
ily as her tutor, Hanna Hakim ’08 pointed to
parts ofthe race on an open workbook page.

Daniela is one of 15 students in the Kle
English Language Learners (ELL) program
within the Grinnell/Newbutg School Dise
trict.Twelve Grinnell College students and six
community members students act as tutors in
the program.

The ELL program began in rhc 1970s
in response to the arrival of
several refugees from Laos,
Cambodia and Vietnam.

"At the time we had
to get pictures and get books

sorr ofwing it,"Twila Rose»
now, ELL coordinator, said.

Thirty years later, the
program has more materi-
als, more students and more tutors Nine of
the 15 students in the program this year are
native Spanish speakers and the other students’
primary languages are Cambodian, Chinese,
Japanese and Russian.

According to Don Longhurst, business
manager of the Grinnell—Nevvburg School
District, the district receives additional fund-
ing from the state for each ELL student who
has been in the program less than three years.

Rosenow said funding has never been
a problem, "It seems like when I’ve needed
funding, I've received it,"shc said.

No formal lcsson plans guide the turoring
sessions, but often teachers will give tutors a
list of things they want them to cover with the
student. Two weeks ago, the tutors began using
a notebook to record what they covered that
day with their student.

“It’s pretty frustrating,” Emily Kugisaki ’09

sai “Sometimes I don’t know what I’m do-

in .
gKugisaki recalls disapproving or tcacltcrs
that put on the backburner students whose ﬁrst
language “ms not English. “Now I’m wonder'
ing how you can balance all rhe backgrounds
and ﬁnd a common language," she said.

Rosenow works closely with teachers. She
said that they are enthusiastic about having
ELL students in class,
and teachers who have
had Spanish in the past
have refreshed and used
their skills.

Chris Coffman, who
has an ELL student in his
third grade class at Dan
vis Elementary school,
agreed. “It seems kind of
scary but it’s been rewarding and you see progn
ress daily, which as a teacher is great,"he said.

Roscnow has been tutoring for over 25
years, but the Grinnell College ELL tutors do
not receive much training. In an effort to hone
the tutors’ skills, this Tuesday Doris Knight,
ESL tutor and activist, and Barbara Dinnen,
pastor of the Spanish speaking congregation
in Des Moines, conducrcd a workshop in the
Forum.
