in Grinnell

Jane, a Grinnell resident, has struggled with poverty her whole
life, in part because of drug addiction and domestic abuse.
Her story is unique, but is also indicative of a wider problem in
Grinnell that organizations such as MICA are addressing.

jane ('name has been changed) works six to eight
hours a day at the Westside Diner to support three
children. Despite governmentsubsidizcd housing,
child support and the help ofMidtIowa Community
Action (MICA), Jane lives paycheck to paycheck.

Jane is one ofthe 10 percent of Grinnellians who
live in poverty. “I’ve struggled throughout my life,”
Jane said in an interview in the basement of the First
Baptist Church before spring break. Her family ties
velopment specialist, Mindy Clayton, and her uncle
both accompanied her. “My entire life I've had to deal
with huge hurdles,"}ane said, “Whether it be family
or friends or addiction or abuse." While Jane’s story
is unique, she has encountered problems common to
many

Poverty in Grinnell

Jane is 28. She has four children, the eldest of
whom now lives with his father. In the last ten years
she has lived in nine different places, mostly in
Grinnell. For six months she was homeless, sleeping
in her car or in friends’ houses. "It's frustrating," she
said. “Sometimes there are things that Ij'usr can‘t do.
It’s hard to accept that. My kids don’t get to wear the
designer clothes and the Nike shoes.

1 had nothing. The only thing my Life consisted of
was drugs."

Jane started using meth seriously when she was
20. With an alcoholic mother, Jane was often left
alone while growing up and fell victim to peer pres-
sure. For jane, drugs were an escape from life's disap—
pointments. "1 used meth to make it all go away." she
said. “To make the loneliness go away, to numb the
pain and the crap that life has handed me."

Jane got treatment and has been clean for two
years. “I thinkl knewI needed to change for several
years before I did," she said. “I just needed enough
courage to step up to myself and look at myself and
say, “It's time.”

Domestic violence made recovery more difﬁcult

Jane had to shake both her addiction to meth and
an unhealthy relationship with the father ofone ofher
children.“1t’s an addiction, in a way. You get beat on
and treated like crap and talked down to for so long
that you just think that that‘s all you are and that‘s
all you can do and you're scared to get out because
on several occasions he could’ve killed me," she said.
“I didn’t have anywhere to run. I had a choice ofbe-
ing in a women’s shelter, but I couldn't do that. It was

degrading to me, maybe."

1 can't afford that. They're spoiled
enough but they know they have to
work for what they want."

' Many of the long-term poor,
like Jane, face complicated prob
lems in getting back on their feet.
"Most families are in poverty for a
short duration," said Dick Stock-
ner, MICA’s director for Poweshiek
Count-y.

According to a Domestic
Violence Alternatives/Sexual
Assault Center (DVA/SAC)
counselor who has to remain
anonymous because of DVA/
SAC’s confidentiality policy,
“domestic violence can often be
harder to escape for poor women
who must rely on their partners
for financial support."

“When women try to set
off on their own in a country

and leaves," usually caused by an

, unexpected and catastrophic event.
“But what you’ll find with most at-
risk low income families that we’re
dealing with is that this |S a long term enterprise be
cause of extreme barriers to sclfrsufﬂcicncy.” Drug
abuse, a history of domestic violence and a lack of
self-confidence can present seemingly insurmountr
able barriers,

lane's is a success story “This is my second year
working. Before that I hadn’t worked for seven years,”
she said. “So it helps,being out among the public and
doing something, earning my keep."

According to the federal government’s poverty
guidehnes, a four-person household like Jane's is liv»
ing in poverty if the family's annual salary is below
$20,000.

on a good day, jane makes $30 in tips a day at
the Westside Diner, but often comes home with less.
She has to budget constantly. “Let's say I make 315
in tips and I necd diapers, formula and food. So 315,
what does that get me? It gets me either a can offor-
mula, and maybe a loaf of bread,”]ane said. “Or we
can go diapers and some food. But it doesn't get all
three. And that's where MICA comes in."MICA has
a food pantry, which can help lowdncome families fill
emergency gaps.

Drug addiction played role in poverty

Two and a half years ago, battling with an ad-
diction to methamphetamincs, Jane was forced to
put three of her children into foster care. The eldest
moved in with his father. Meth had taken over Jane’s
life. “I didnt care about anything. Ilove my kids, dont
get me \viong, it’s not that I didnt love them, ’Jane
said.

“Its not that I didnt care for them; 1 fed them,
clothed them. But I couldn’t be there for them. It was
a hard realization to come to. I was at the point where

good alsomethirlg.”
Jane, Grinnell resident

in which the minimum wage is
not enough to get by," it is of
ten impossible for them to “get
an iipaitinent, get ajoh, get a car
and support their kids,” the counselor said.

The economic aspect ofdomestic violence “is one
of the most insidious kinds of abuse because it's too
difficult a lot of times to express it. It's haid to say,
‘My husband who makes all the money won't give me
any.‘ People will often take that with a grain ofsalt."

jane could not stop her children from Witnessing
her abuse. “You can't shelter them from it at all. If
you're in the other room and he’s beating you, or if
you're standing right in front ofthem and he’s beating
you, you’re not sheltering them from it," she said.

“It’s something we have to deal with still. Espe-
cially with my daughter, to know that it's not appror
priatc that men treat her like that. And to my boys,
it’s not appropriate that men not treat women like
that. Hopefully they won’t be too affected by it."

According to the DVA/SAC counselor, 1.3 mil-
lion children witness domcstic violence every year, 90
percent ofchildren are aware of the violence and 30 to
70 percent of batteiets abuse the children as well. But
even when childrenj‘ust witness the abuse, they have
behavioral, social and emotional problems more often
than children from healthy families.

Jane says she would not have gotten sober without
a strong support system. Her uncle plays a large role.
“He helped me understand that I'm an addict and he's
been with me the whole entire rime."1‘le’s also Jane’s
ride. “He deserves an award,"she said.

Her family development specialists from MlCA,
Mindy Clayton and Rachel Poratb, help too, both as
emotional support and as advocates who can refer her
to social service agencies and speak to people on her
behalf.

Still, many people close to jane l).\l'l'lt: addiction.

“It's hard to support family members and friends who
use. It’s hard to point yourself away from that. Most
of the family that I'm close to, they’re all alcoholics
and addicts.w -

With MICA‘s helpiJane has become a success story

These days, jane has a stable job, is off meth, and
feels in control of her life. “I don't really feel Like using
anymore. 1 just have people who 1 can call. People
who 1 know can help me through that."

Jane and three of her children have been living in
the same apartment for a year now. She feels proud
that she now provides a good example to her children,
and that she can give them a stable home. “Knowing
that they can grow up and choose a different life than
I did is inspiring.”

Although much ofjanc's life is difﬁcult, she still
keeps some time for herself.“My kids now go to their
fatheis’ every other weekend. So that’s a big help. I
have at least a couple hours after I get home from
work to do what I need to do for myself You know, if]
need to just sit down in a corner and cry somewhere 1

can do that without upsetting my childien. Working, '

although it ‘s stressful,‘ is time for myself, too. It makes
me feel productive."

Yet some days Jane gets frustrated.“There will be
days when I will be angry and say to myself, ‘Why
does everything have to happen to meP’This person
gets everything handed to them, they have this sweet
life and Im angry, jealous and resentful but 1 think
that everybody’s different. Everybodys good at some—
thin

line wants to go to college to study psychology
She mnts to be able to help out other addicts. The
stress now, however, is too much. “It’s hard to deal
with, knowing that I had potential to be more, that
1 sun have potential to be more, but it would n huge
struggle for me right now to cvcn try to attempt to go
to college. I was thinking of going back to college just
last semester and at this point I think that my life‘s
just too chaotic."

Yet despite these frustrations, Jane is able to see
how far she’s come.

“Knowing that you can’t provide for your children
is horrible. It brings you way way way down. Then
you start feeling sorry for yourself, making excuses for
yourself, and that just doesnt work. You 0always have
to step out of that,’ she said. “You call your friend

[and say], 1 dont have any formula, can you get
me enough formula to get me through tomorrow so I
thnt I can get diaper-s, so that I can feed my kids?‘ And
you always have food. You ulwnys have those crappy
vegetables in yolli cupboard but you cnn lllwnys find a
way it might not be a gourmet meal but your children
are fed They have food' in their stomach It might not
be what they wanted, but thats life."
