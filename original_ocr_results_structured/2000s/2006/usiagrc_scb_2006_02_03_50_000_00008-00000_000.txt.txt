Men’ s basketball needs w1ns on the road to

KY KEVIN BVRNE

After their toughest weekend of the year, the
Grinnell men's basketball team emerged battered,
bruised, but still in contention for that coveted belth
in the Midwest Conference Tournament.

After two hilid’fougl‘ll’ losses to #25 Carroll Cola
legc and #3 Lawrence University, Grinnell posted a
victory in a must-win horue contest against Mon-
mouth College, man. As they currently prepare
for an extremely Important road trip to Wisconsin,
the Pioneers ale in the driver’s seat in the MWC.

Grinnell got off to a hot start on Friday against
the visiting Carroll College Pionccts, lohn Gritbetg
'09 poured in 31 points and Mike Schmidt '08 hit
six three-pointers on his way to 25 points. Unfotnr
natcly, Carroll also started off strong, keeping up with
Grinnell and pushing the system to its limits. At the
end of a fast paced game, Carroll came out on top,
150-138.

They never really took us out ofrhythm. we did
score 138 points," said Jack Kennedy '06. “They did
slow us down a bit by trying to double tcam John
[Grotbelg], but we still had our opportunities. They
simply outscored us with great open court offense.
They were not afraid ofthc speed ofthc system."

.The tough loss to Carroll did not make things any
easier on Saturday, as Grinnell hosted Lawrence Unis
versity, ranked #3 in the country and the only team in
the nation with a perfect record.

Lawrence displayed excellent defense and limited
the Pioneers' offensive pioduction. Grotberg scored
27 points, Keith Chamberlain ‘08 had 10 points and
Doug Ticus '07 had eight points and nine rebounds
as Grinnell put up a seasonslow 79 points in a 9849
defeat.

”Lawrence is a very solid defensive basketball
team," said Ticus. “They have the mentality, strength
and speed to play straight up,hard nosed man to man
defense against us. They were able to bump us and
take us out of what we usually do. They were by far
the best defensive team we have faced all year, and I
would not be surprised if they are one of the [op de,
fensive teams in the country."

After two difﬁcult ma‘tch-ups, Grinnell had an-

Forlordan Allison '09, it was her first threesmeter
dive. For sprinter Peter Brown '06, It was a chance to
swim long distance. For Liz Mallot’Oo, itwas the last
meet of her swimming career.

Lastweekcnd the Grinnell swim team participated
in a double duel against Coe College and Monmouth
College, winning comfortably in both competitions.
Because it was the last meet of the season, Coach
Erin Hurley allowed 62 team members to compete,
the most she‘s taken this year.

“We wanted to take as many could go,"said Hur-
ley,

For those team members who are going on to the
Midwest Conference, the meet allowed for some ex»

strokes they hadn't tried before,"said Hurley

For the swimmers whose seasons were coming to
an end, the meet gave them the opportunity to swim
their strongest, a feat exempliﬁed by Mallot, who
dropped 20 seconds from her 100 breast stroke.

Co-cnptttln Sarah Stayet ’06, who was an Allr
American diver last year, provisionally qualified for
Midwest Conference in the three meter dive This
qualification was especially impressive as Stayer re

Hurley was impressed by her ability to adapt so

Stayer's last chance to qualify for nationals.

Nate Wittnam ’09, has confidence that both teams
will perform well.“We'te really in a position to drop a

A win in conference would be the eighth consecu-
tive for the women’s team and a fifth for The men.
The dominance of Gtinnell's swimming and diving
team: in the conference puts a lot of pressure on the
athletes.

“Every year you win another, the other teams want
to dethrnne you even more," said Hurley,

For now, both the men’s and women’s teams will
enjoy their new, relaxed schedule and the lingering
mtcitement oftheir last meet ofthe season.

The Grinnell womens basketball team had a difficult weekend
falling to two of the top teams in the Midwest Conference on bac —
tosback days.The Pioneers went into the weekend with a record of
778 (375) MWC, confident that their best basketball could defeat
the competition.

With one of their top scorers, Hannah Wolf ’08, out with a leg
injury, the Grinnell offense struggled against Carroll College on
Friday, as they fell 6448.

The two seniors on the team led the way on the scoreboard.
Katy Bowen had 18 points, including two three-pointers and Lau—
ten Meredith tallied nine points, going four-for»four from the field
and converting her only free throw attempt. However, a late first-
half surge from Carroll was enough to take the Pioneers out of the

amt.
g “We had a bad 10 minutes at the end of the first half against
Carroll which ultimately gavc them the margin for victory," said
Head Coach Andy Hamilton.

The Pioneers gave Lawrence a mllch tougher game on Saturday,
outscoring the visiting Vikings in the second half, thanks to strong
performances from Bowen and Emily Kolbe '08.

Bowen led the way with 19 points and Kolbe had seven points
and seven rebounds. However, Grinnell could not manage to break
through in the end, falling 51-54.

“I think we were all disappointed with our performance versus
Carroll," said Kolbe. “However, we came out ready to play versus

Lawrence and put up a good fight. We played well, but our shots
just werent falling when we needed them to We put ourselves in a
position to win that game, but wejust couldn‘t make it happen."

Grinnell did make it happen three nights later, when they took
on Monmouth College at home in Darby Gym.

Bowen led the way for the Grinnell offense once again with a
total of 21 points.]odi Wdtkins ’09 went six-fortseven from dowm
town for 19 points, Kolbe had 12 points and Meredith had six points
and a team-high seven rebounds.

The Grinnell defense held Monmouth to just 39 percent shoot-
ing and came outvictorious, 73-63.

“The win against Monmouth was extremely important," said
Watkins, “because I think it will be the spark that leads us to have
a great final stretch of games. Having just come off a very tough
weekend oftwo really competitive games and coming up short den
spite our efforts, the Monmouth game was a well-deserved temtd
for our hard work and desire."

Grinnell will have to continue to train hard because they have a
difficult stretch on the road ahead of them. The Pioneers will face
conference rival Ripon Collcge today in Wisconsin and they will
play against Beloit College, another conference opponent, tomor-
row.

"Success in the next few road games will be contingent upon
us making some shots," said Hamilton. “We’re doing as well as we
can on defense right now but our shooting percentage could use a
boost."
