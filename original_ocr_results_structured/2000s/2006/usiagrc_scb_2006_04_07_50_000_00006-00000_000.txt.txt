Broken backs, broken promises

Brokeback M ntam( )

It seems that a safer way for st ight dudes to get
out otseeing Bottom Moimmm is not to argue that
the movie is too gay, but too girly.l Notjnst a a story
about homosexuals, it has also been callcd a “chick
ﬂick,”a label that cattle: implications that Ang Lee's
film does not deserve. Tlmt particular classiﬁcation
coujurcs images of turgid, wccpy melodrama or ge-
netic and industrialized romantic comedy. Although
there is both humor and tragedy in Biwkubnrll Moore
min, iti-iscs far above such minimal expectations. The
world that Ang Lee manages to capture with his cams
era is a richly authentic fully developed world where
the lives of two men gradually unfold with both great

dignity and an honest sense ofeveryday life

Part ofthe dignity comes from the way in which
the characterization of the two male leads, jack and
Ennis, dodges stereotypes, nnd notjust the stereotype
of the eftetc gay man. What this film allows for is a
multitude of homosexual personalities, these men are
both tough ranch hands,but they have wildly different
sexual Lives and demands. As they fall back into their
closeted public lives, the differences between Jack and
Ennis become even clearer. Their lives are shown not
as a judgmental good and evil duality, but rather as
two fascinating stories of psychological struggle that
remind us what the gay rights movement has been
fighting for all along.

Thankfully, the story is told to us through good
old-fashioned quality film making, rather than heavyr
handed rhetoric. The cinematography captures the
Rocky Mountains with grace and seemingly efforts
less skill, and the acting is almost without exception,
superb.

PHopcﬁLLly, there will come a day when we will not
have to be so grateful for film making that depicts
homosexual drama with the same level ofqunlity and
nuance that we would expect from a heterosexual
drama otserious concern. Until that day, Bro/errata
Mountain remains a powerful example offilm making
that refuses to give easy answers and cheap satisfac-
tion, and so shall be held up as one the best examples
ofn hopefullyemetgening ﬁlm movement (along with
the incredibly brilliant Swedish ﬁlm Fucking/11ml.

vesting them has become the surrounding area’s prir
mary economic opportunity, This context creates a
series of tragic situational ironies. The people around
Lake Victoria oversa'turate the European market with
ﬁsh while they themselves suffer through famine.
Also, the elimination of native species caused by the
arrival of the Nile Perch has destroyed Lake Victoria's
natural cleaning system and the lake will soon be one
able to sustain the fishing economy

The general tone of the ﬁlm is rambling but it is
interspersed with intense moments of brutality. Scenes
that can be hard to watch include orphans ﬁghting
each other for food, a security guard who shoots in-
truders with poison tipped arrows and the most heart
breaking usage ofBilly the Loud Mouth Bass I have
ever seen, The conditions shown are harrowing and
the communities around Lake Victoria are decimated
by AIDS and poverty The film shows the Tanzanian

fishing industry’s neglect of these issues and the rise
ofprostitution, disease and homelessness.

Darwin’s Mgitmore even suggests that the planes
that carry the fish back to Europe are smuggling in
weapons and that African nations crave war because
wartime is the only situation in which the internar
rional community pays enough attention to send aid.

While the evidence for these final claims is a little
suspect the film does an excellentjob of documenting
the abuses ofthe ﬁshing industry and how they are igs
noted by Western markets. Despite its many effective
scenes, the ﬁlm can at times be frustrating long and
contains more shots of airplanes followed by shots of
the shadows of the same airplanes than is truly nccch
sary For most of its length though, Darwin} Nigh-
mm is brave enough to ask some radical questions
and is a through mtpose ofa truly horriﬁc situation.
