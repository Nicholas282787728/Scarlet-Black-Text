The Tw ns f

~ The pitching staff is
the worst in the majors,
but I think rhat’ll come
around.
~ It would really say
something if they trade off players
who’ve been the face of the team for
the last 10 years.
' The AL Central got better, All the
Twins players, the veterans that made
up the dynasty, got too expensive for
the Twins to hold on to.
'There’s no disappointment with how
Joe Mauer’s doing this year.
- The worst off-season move was not
making a move for a better offensive
designated hitter,
- Our team isn’t as bad as they've been
playing.
~We have the best pitehing prospect in
the majors, Francisco Liriano. He got
shelled last time out, but so did everys
one else their last time out.
~ It's May 3. You can't say ‘wait till nexr
year' at least until the end of June. As
long as there’s a statistical possibility
that they could make the playoffs, you
have to think they will

- Grady Little has a little more poison-

The softball team teetered on the edge of the bubble last week,
with only two doubleheaders left before the end of the regular sea
son and a south Division Midwest Conference bid still up for grabs.
The Pioneers were still struggling to close their doubleheaders
as a mustrwin situation with their final pair of games rapidly ap-
proachedThe Pioneers dropped the second game eta nonreonterr
ence doubleheader against buena Vista last Thursday, only inereasr
ing the pressure as they headed into the weekend.

The softball team looked unfazed as they stepped onto the field
in Monmouth, taking down the Fighting Seots 5st and orz, breakr
ing out of the second-game slump that had followed them for the
four doubleheadcrs before Monmouth.

The softball team was led by the pitching ofLec Anne steinberg
'07 and Gaby Flores '09, who held the Fighting Seots to 1 and 2 runs
respectively in the games against Monmouth. The Fighting Scots
put up their first and only run of Game One with a solo homer in
the bottom or the seventh inning. Monmouth rated a little better in
their second game against the Pioneers, plating two runs and lead-
ing 2,0 until the bottom ofthe fourth inning. The softball team tied
the game with a two tun triple off the bat ofSandra King ’08, who
had an RBI-double iii the first game against the Seots.The Pioneers
ﬁnished their sweep ofMonmouth with a three run double by King
and an RBlrsingle by Katie Bartlett'09 ending the last game or the
regular season in a eonvineing fashion.

The pair ofvictories gave the Pioneers a reeotd of20—13 (srs
MWC), which was good enough to push them into the ’06 MWC
tournament as the number two seed in the South Division, follow-
ing close behind Lake Forest,

The softball team is in Lake Forest, Ill. today, wrapping up
a game against rival Ripon College. The Pioneers will finish the

- A lot ofpeople’s problem with Dusty

give him credit for that.

to wonder about ‘thc curse' and what
