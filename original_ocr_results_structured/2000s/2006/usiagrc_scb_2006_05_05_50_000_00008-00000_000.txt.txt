Why don’t you get a job?

Wc are so busy that studying can somtrimcs seem like an or
tracurriculnr. Amidst the barrage of classes. meetings, clubs. emails.
pnpcrwork, phone calls, photocopying, community scrvicc. lccrurcs.
lunchcs and conferences. our academic laundry never dries.

On top of all these obligations (and opportunities). many stir
dents take part in a fedeial work—study. or work to help pay for their
education. while attending Grinncll.

Workrsrudy came inro bcing whcn rhc Economic Opporrunity
Act of 1964 was passed with its rlzirarz dim being to encourage and
to help low-income families send their childrcn to collcgc. Though
it has been amended since, the original
and primary stipulation for workrsrudy
was that "the work is related to the

student's educational objective" (blip-ﬂ Dan Malarkey ‘08

wwwmmparmrg) A

Perhaps Grinncll can return to the
root ofthc term workrstudy so that Stun
dcnts’ work is actually study. related to
thcir "cducnrion objcctivc."For academically inclincd smdcnts, a Sort
ofapprenriceship could bc developed in which n student worked as
an assistant to a professor. doing secretarial work. while at the same
time helping the professor with her academic rescnrch by tracking
down sources, editing hcr papers and more.

Some students work for professors. but as far as I understand.
there is no program that facilitates such a partnership. The Summer
Research and Mcntorcd Advanced Projects (MAP) at Grinncll are
paid programs in which studcnrs work closcly with fnculry during
the summer; but MAPs completed during a semester are not paid.

Ispokc with several faculty members who have taught at Grinncll
for more than 30 years. and thcy agreed that cvcn though rhcy reach
fewer courses than 20 years ago. they have less time. partly due to
an increase in bureaucratic and administrative commitments.Thcy
could use a hand. maybe two. Student apprentices could lighten
thcir workload without displacing Grinncll’s talented sniff,

Diligent apprentices to faculty members could advance Grin’
hell’s prestige. With surdcnts’hclp, Gtinncll professors could pub-
lish more. which would in turn increase the prcsrigc of academic
programs at the college.

The students could also help the professors prepare state of
the art audiovisual presentations for conferences. For example. this
scmcsrcr 1 voluntccrcd to hclp prepare n Powchoint prcscnrrrion
with video that Professor Ellen Mease used at Beckett conferences
worldwide.

This apprenticeship program would not only help professors but
also students. Students would better understand the process of re
search, publishing and teaching, and could mnkc a more informed
choice on whether they would like to go to graduate school. They
certainly would bc more than ready for ir.

L tters‘to the Editor

This suggcstion for a rcform of workrsmdy is not exclusively
geared to students interested in academia. Students interested in
landscape architecture. the hcnlth professions or food scrvicc could
work with Facilitics Management, the Health Center. or Dining
Services. rcspccrivcly,

Thus, the college would be crcntrng mini-paid inrcrnships dur-
ing the semester that would be study clirccrly rclarcd rc smdcnts'
academic and Career objectivcstThouglt this happens in some cases
on the campus. such as in the case of computer science students
employed by Information Technology Scrviccs.l think a greater
commitment to work that is study could
be institutionalized. .

This progressive change in work-study
would seem to agrcc with the thinking
of some trustees. Just last week a trustee
ﬂoated the idea of having the Economics
department pick a student or two to sit
on Grinnell’s investment committee. Turn
this into a paid position, and work-study will finally be living up to
its promise.

As it stands. most workrst’udy is seen as a break from studying,
and falls under the second prong to the Economic Opportunity act:
“or such work will be in the public interest and is work which would
not otherwise bc provided" (trip/mourntripping). Under this
provision. several of my ﬂoor mates, who are members of Phi Bctn
Kappa, excellent researchers and closc renders gust ask rny of their
professors), work in the dining hall — rhey‘vc bccn working there for
four years and enjoy ir.

And yet. maybe the college is not tapping into thcir economic
potential. As a student research assistant. the college could pay my
floor mates the sum: wagcs as a student worker in the dining hall

But because rhcir research skills cost morc, economically speak-
ing. than those of a student worker in a dining hall, the college could
beneﬁt greatly from employing its young scholars.

In January. I had received no pnid offers to do work at Grinnell
that was dirccrly related to “my educational objective." I’ve had a
vcry positive working experience at the Admission orficc. and a
mixed experience at Harris as a projectionist (please don’t throw
tomatoes at me). but nothing in terms of my academic and artisr
tic endeavorsThat is until the SEE came along. For this semester,
1 have been paid by Grinncll College to work on my writing by way
ofopinion articles.

so. next nine you find yourself laughing your sweatpants otfnr
articles (and their errors) in the 388. maybe you should think about
working for it (or for other publications that pay. like The Srquzmc).
From “Millions” to “Headlines.” from “Fashion” to “Gossip,” my ar-
ticlcs have nmuscd some otyou. and annoyed orhcrs. And now it’s
your turn to work. Simply put: “just gcr a job. man."

Docs the invitation to the Syrian ambassadoi con-

couragcd to ignorc Syria’s rccord on human rights?

Should we overlook the signiﬁcant fact that unlike
Egypt and Jordan, both nfwhich have n 13ch: ngicc- ambassador?
mcnr and diplomatic ties with Israel (nebulous or not,
these trcitits hivo bccn upheld). Syrir his not conrriburcd ro pcncc

Or shouki wc non: with disrury that. conrrury ro rhc spirit ofrhc

Has Grinncllian conccrn over human rights and freedom of

the Syrian government has aggressively stiﬂed internal opposition.

you can fool nil the people all the time. So of ill the
Arab countries in thc Middle East. what motivatcd the
invitation to the Syrian nmbrssndor?

We are near the and of the semester. Faculty and
students are all tired. eager to get through the next two
weeks.

chcrrhclcss, will rucmbcrs of rho campus com-
munity who idcnrify rhcmsclvcs wirh progrcssivc

resolution rather than intimidation and force—maintain polite si-
lcncc at the claim that “Ambassador Moustapha‘s visit to Grinncll
