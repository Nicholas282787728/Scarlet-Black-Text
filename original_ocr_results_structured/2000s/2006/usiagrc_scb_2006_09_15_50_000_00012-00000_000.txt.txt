September 15 , 1978

"A new brctd or Student rs inﬁltrating
Grinncll, arising from thc teeming, atrluenr
suburbs ofour nation."

This is not another plea from an embitr
tered upperclassman raging against changing
demographics and cell phones. Indeed, when
Dave Blatt wrote this warning in the SUB, cell
phones had not even been invented.

Twenty-eight years ago, Blart cautioned
his fellow students against “a growing wave of
terror which threatens to engulr us up to our
chins, our mouths, our nostrils, our tent ducts,
etc.”

What was this terrible trend?

Where does the cash go?

In three weeks at Gtinntzll I have spent $13.70 in
campus cash. What happened to this money you ask?
Have i done excessive amounts of laundry? No,you‘ve
seen me wearing the same pants everyday. That mon-
e'y has gone to photocopying. In three Weeks, at 5.05 a
page,1 have photocopied 274 pages for required class
reading. When 1 pay $35,000 to attend this schooli
plus upwards of $300 on books, imd can make 100
photocopies ofa stick ﬁgure (because I'm in some ob-
scure graphite appreciation club where the only other
member is my next door neighbor who doesn’t even
know the club exists) FOR FREE, why am I wasting
my time and money going to Burling, looking up the
call number, waitin (im)pat‘iendy at the circulation
eleslo checking out t e book, making the photocopies,
and bringing it back?

Absence of remembrance

Crikey! Last Monday, the PioncctVi/eb's headline '

was something to the effect of“Good-b re Steve"with
a link entitled “Crikey” which led to a NN headline
report about the unfortunate death about Steve Irwin,
”Crocodile Hunter." ,

However, THIS Monday was the ﬁve year anni-
versary of 9/11. There was no headline on Pioneers
Web on Monday. simply the customary: “Welcome,
Shannon,”

Have we become so stuckup that we can’t express
any sort of feelings fox our own countiy? Did I see
any signs of remembrance posted anywhere around
campus? No, Did we observe anything remotely 1c-
larcd to a moment of silence? Not that I know of.
Did I hear anyone talk about it? Maybe one, pos-
sibly two. The high school can observe a moment
of silence; why can't we? What‘s wrong with us, the
students, at Grinnell College?

Throw open the doors

1 know you think that I’m gonna whine about
the new Campus Center, but I love the new joint
its prerty awesome, and we're not even done with
construction! But every night between midnight
and 1:00 am, the CC closes up tight. Ifyou‘i-c in
the middle orworidag there and you’re walking
back from your dorm (with a bounce in your stop
and a smile on your race), as soon as you pull on
those big glassy doors; nothing. You only went back
to your room for some snacks and an extra book,
but suddenly you’re outta luck. There are card read-
ers next to all the doors, but they're turned off 24
hours a day. Cah’twcjust open the CC so that stu-
dents can take advantage of a campus centcttthat’s
supposed to be convenient for everyone? It would
work ifwc were all responsible We are responsible,
right?
