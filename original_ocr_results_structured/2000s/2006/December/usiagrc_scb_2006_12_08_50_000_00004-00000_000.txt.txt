Little Miss Sunshine

Wacky family = great film

Valerie Paris and Jonathan Dayton's
stunning debut is one of those ﬁlms
that defy deﬁnition: though oversthes
top funny, LiII/c Mitt Suns/line delin
ers a surprisingly understated message.
And while plainly not a family trim, it
is a certainly a film about family,

The Hoover clan has seen bets
(or times: deluded dad Rachaid (Greg
Kinnear) is banking on a bad deal for
his “Nine steps” motivational program,
while mom Cheryl (Toni Collette)
attempts to keep the family emotions
allv and financially aﬂoat. Meanwhile,
Cheryls suicidal brother Frank (Steve
enroll in a surprisingly nuanced pets
formnnce)7rhe country's leading
Proust scholarihas been entrusted to
her care, Richard’s freewheeling dad
(Alan Arkin), kicked out of his retires
ment home for snorting heroin, has
settled onto their couch and Dwayne,
Cheryl’s Nietzche-obsessed 15-year-
old son from a previous marriage, has
taken a vow of silence. only adorable
7-yearrold Olive (an endearing Abigail
Bresljn) is anything at all encouraging
for the crestfallen family, and it's her
Little Miss Sunshine pageant dreams
that put the family on the road and
bring them together.

Scenes with the police_ and the fam-
ily' 5 broken- down VW are particularly
hilarious, while Olive s pageant perfor
mance is well worth the price ofadmise
sion The film is about real family dy-
namics, and the cast members play well
off each other. Writer Michael Arndt's
characters are no one trick ponies, and
he IS careful to give each genuine feelv
m gs and perspectives.

ing Bee). The movie follows New not
Timtr crossword editor Will Shortz
and a few or the 50 million people ch
cry week who attempt his crossword
puzzles, which are widely known as the
creme de la creme ofthe puzzle world
The story follows three main sub
ject groups through the duration of
the ﬁlm: Shortz himself and his rise to
“Puzzle Master," his band of dedicated
high—proﬁle followers and some of the
fastest crossword competitors in the
United States as they take on the Na»

Director Patrick Crendon artfully
mixes snspense and humor as he cuts

Stewart and President Bill Clinton at-

’ tempting to explain their obsession

The film tries to explain why so
many people sit back every morning
and attempt to solve the New Yin-It
Tmm puzzle; the answer seems to be
that crosswords feed humans’ innate
need to be challenged

Creadon succeeds where many
documentary makers fail. He brings
his audience through a whole gambit
of emotions, leading them to discover
something intrinsically true in theme

selves.

With so many of Hollywood's films
serving as nothing more than eye cans
dy, Wordplay succeeds in engaging the
viewer's attention and intelligence. It
is a gem of a documentary that is ac—
cessible, entertaining and stimulating—
something that does not come around
very often.

Jesus Camp (2006)
attempt

Creepy indoctrination in
more ways than one

Although the documentary jinn
Camp preaches against the dangers
of indoctrination, propaganda nd a
closedrminded perspective, it is itself
a propagandistic and closed-minded
ﬁlm whose bias is apparent from start
to ﬁnish. The ﬁlm focuses on a Chris
tian children's summer camp and three
campers who attend it. Recently, thanks
to rabble—rousers such as Michael

Moore and films like Super Sizc Me,
this kind of“shocksdoc" has gained in
popularity. Most of these films claim
to have an objective viewpoint, but in
fact do not. [mu Camp falls into this
category Ifyou have something against
evangelical Christians and want to hate
them more, this is the film for you,
since you can’t help but be manipulated
to that view by the filmmakers.

You can make a biased ﬁlm about
General Motors, gun control or fast
food, but taking pot shots at religion is
taking it too far. If this movie criticized
any other religion it wouldn't he plays
ing at Grinncll, I'm not even going to
call this film a documentaryzjeanvLuc
Goddard said it best when he labeled
this type offilm a “crock-umcntary."
