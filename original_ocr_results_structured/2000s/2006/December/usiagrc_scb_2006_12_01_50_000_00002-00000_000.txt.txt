Technical problems keep KDIC radio off the air its first semester in the JRC

liY CHLOE MORVL

After months of setbacks, postponcmcnr, and waiting, the
student radio station KDIC has officially been cancelled for
this semester.

originally housed in Darby, KDIC temporarily moved two
years ago to Younker Pit, With rlre building or the JRC, KDIC
made yer another more. However, this relocation has caused
many more problems than expected,

“KDIC didn't run this semester due to complications re
lated to constluction,"said Station Managcl Daniel Fuluta‘OB.
“The location wasn‘t completed until late in September, and
then everything didn't get connected and running until the
weekend before Thanksgiving break,"

Program Director Paul Vl/aintight ‘07 said new problems
continued to occul. “We just had a whole slew of problems,"
he said.“Sometlling was installed upside down, we couldn't get
a hold of our engineer to fix it, and then he didn’t ﬁnish comr
plctcly, so there were like five weeks after fall break where we
expected to go on but couldn't,"

Jim Davies, based
in Iowa City, is KDIC's
engineer. He is confl-
dcnt that KDIC will
be ready by next set
mester. “I’ve got about
95 percent of it done,"
said Davies “Part of the
reason it didn't get done
is my time. I do a lot of
work with other stations
and being such a small station, KDIC is low on the priority List,
and there really aren't a lot of extra folks that understand how
to do all this,"

Both Furutli and Walnright are disappointed that KDIC
would not be up and running this-semester, but lemain positive
tor next semester. “The lack ofraditr for the people involved
with KDIC is unfortunate," said Furuta. "thn KDIC starts
up again, our presence will deﬁnitely be noticed."

Tommy Olson '10 said he had been disappointed to not

”/ do a lot of work with other
stations, and being such a small
slat/0n, KDIC is low on the prior
fly llsl”

have KDIC around,“1
can't wait to have the
KDIC around because
I’m looking forward ro
listening to a college
radio and seeing what
type of shows and
music other students
are interested in,” he
said “i keep on seeing
posters, but I have no
idea what KDIC is all

about.”

Louis Gulino '07

was slated to D] a

hip-hop show on KDIC this scrncsrcr "1rd be nice to have a
show in the Campus Center." Gullno said, “Last semester we
broadcast from the basement in Ypuiikcr, and I don’t think that
anybody really enjoyed that.“

Wainwright, who is gmduating in December, was wistful
about KDIC. “There are just a lot of little things that make
KDIC great," he said. “I've always really valued the presence
of this unique, diverse, and generally pretty thoughtful radio
presence in my vicinity. I don’t know how many people listen
to the radio, but NPR
doesn't always do the
trick, so in just a lot of
ways KDIC not being
on the air does have a
detrimental effect and
that’s why it needs to
get back on the air."

Wainright said the
focus is now on next
semester. “We have stu-
denr shows, some with
professors, and hopefully with a syndication or two, KDIC will
have a lot more rcleVant and interesting programming," he said,
“We’re going to have a lot less dead air and a lot more quality."

 

”I’m looking forward to listens
ing to a (allege rad/0 station
and see/mg What type ofshows
and mus/r Olht’lSll/(lfﬂls are
lmeresled In.”
