A wcckirom now, after the inevitable all nightci‘s,
the illshed essays and the even more rushed goodbyes,
we will leave our college empty. This seems as natural
a time as any foi us to take a backwards glance over
0111 collective sliouldcis and sec wlieie we‘ve come
from and what we've lcairlcd.

Ifyou’rc still reading this column aftci a whole sc»
mestci- and aren’ty'nst reading to feel a rush ofslightly
iighteous indignation,
you know I've been thinks
ing about some things. So
I'm going to share some
of what I've learned over
the past semester with
you, silent you, with little
pomp or anything.

I‘ve learned that we all
worship something. by woiship 1 mean what we value
above all else, what becomes the index ot‘our lives. I
can worship beauty, or 1 can worship intelligence, or
I can worship sadness, or i can worship a crush, or a
god or science, or Wesleysiiipes The problem is that
most ideas Just arcnt big enough to hold all my love.
lfi love my intelligence, I end up feeling stupid lfl
love my beauty] end up worrying that Im ugly. ltI
worship someone else, they might not really want to
be worshippcd by me, or even be worth it. What I
realized is that you can worship whatever you want,
And it's up to me how 1 Worship. And that the real
problem is finding something 1 can worship wcll.

1 ve kept on reminding myselfihai no matter how
much i ccms llkC it, Im not the center of the \llll’
versel just so happens that everything in my life
seems to have me at the center ofit, every event, ev»
eiy sensation. But I'm not actually the center ofrhc
uiiivcise. Not every ielationship I’m in will be hit
changing. Not everything 1 do has carthesliaueriiig
importance to the history ofWestern civilization. Not
evei-ybody's looking at me
all the time.

I’ve learned and IC'
learned that I’m the only
person who's responsible
for my own life. Not my
friends, not some girl I
have a crush on, not my
family. If I have to be
saved, I have to save myself

I've lcained that college isn't the end ot everything
Iliat I can relax sometimes because lfl don't do well
on this paper, or with this iiicndship, the world vvont
burn down.

And that's it. I hope you take care ot'yoursclfthis
next week. I hope you get a chance to sit down with
youi friends and take ~ me time to laugh with them
and speak in a funny voice othei people would think
was stupid. I hope your next semester is great. Finally,
since 1 spent all semester telling you what 1 thinlt,I
want you to tell me what you think, Send me an or
mall.

Back in the day, fantasy lit had standards

And now that
I'm 18, that window of fame and op-
portunity has passed. Now that I’m
an adult,l can't get published for the
mere fact that I’m young and writing.
Now my work actually has to be ofdes

pound my keyboiid, spew out a word

character (El-ago .tutn the D into

I suppose 1 could start writing for

.Wizards of the Coast (the company

that took social ineptness to a new
level when they invented Magic Cards)
and work as piooi’ editor, then slowly
work my way up
to Head Vi/ritet of

take much effort
I guess, because
kids seem to be

they can these days

put my English degree toward somer

major in literature), and make millions
by throwing old fantasy classics into a
blender and making 1] novel out ofwhat
