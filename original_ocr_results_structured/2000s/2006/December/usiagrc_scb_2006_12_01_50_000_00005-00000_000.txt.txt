The Sting (1973)

Prepare to have your
mind blown

A good movie, like 7715 lW/n‘iix.
makes you think by altering reality in
a vaguely plausible way. A great movie,
on the other hand, blows your mind
thle keeping IealItv intaet. Take a
wild guess which one The Sling Is. Its
no coincidence tliat' it wonzl 1Best Pit;-
turc Oscar, people.

The titirlat Sling is one carried out
by con man Johnny Hooker (Robert
Redford) in revenge for the slaying of
his partner Luther Coleman (Robs
cit Earl Jones, aka James Earl Jones
dad), or course, the man hes going
after, Chicago crime boss Doyle Lona
negan (Robert Shaw), is no easy target
and won't fall for any ol’ con game, so
Johnny enlists the help of seasoned
con artist Henry Gondorff (Paul Nth

, man, akzl the salad dressing guy) and a
troupe of amiable old crooks to help
him “trim" the “mark" good in one last
big con. Throw in Hookers continus
ing evasion of Crooked cop Lieutenant
William Snyder (Charles Durning)
who wants a kickback and/or to kick
Hooker‘s backside, and you’ve got an
amazingly tense picture that keeps your
head spinning.

As to how exactly they get Lon~
negan and remove snyder from the
picture well. I can't tell you that, for
therein lies the beauty of this movie.
The perfectly laid—out plot keeps you
guessing but never loses you. indeed,
the plot is a con man (con entity?) in
its own right, lulling you into a false
sense of security and then pulling the
rug out from under you time and tune
agaIn. The movie throws you enough
red herrings to feed the Swedish army.
Needless to say, they save the biggest
eon for the finale, and let me tell you7
it is a whopper.

One cannot talk about T17: Sling
without mentioning the soundtrack A
lightly adapted version of Scottjoplrn's
“The Entertainer"starrs it off, and then
it's almost exclusively ragtime music
throughout, which fits perfectly with
the 1930s setting ot‘rhe movie The
producers even dug up the old 1936

Universal Pictures logo for the begins
ning instead ofusing the contemporary
version. The only slightly stylized vi»
sion or Depressionscra Chicago we're
treated to is beautifully laid out, and
the cue cards used to signal shirts beT
tween .Icts feel right at home and not
at all hokcy,
777i- szing is what a movie should
be. It‘s got ii little something for every-
body: high stakes poker games, shoot
outs, restaurant romances. prostitutes
on carousels (yes, you read that right)
and imaginative twists that you don‘t
see coming but can accept as realistic
once thcy°ve passed. The only draws
backl can see is that after you ve seen it
once, you '11 want to see it a second time
just to catch the clues you missed the
first time around. Come to think ofit,
that’s not really a drawback at all.

The Da Vinci Code (2006)

*tﬁiﬁrﬁ

Blockbuster book yields
extremely lame movie

After the literary phenomenon
that was Dan Brown’s thriller The DH
Vinti‘ Code. most people expected to
see the Hollywood version of the story
splashed across screens all over Amers
ica. What they didn't expect, however,
was for the movie to be one of the big-
gest cinematic disappointments of the
last decade.

The movie might not have been so
problematic it it had not been tor the
whirlwind of hype that surrounded it
from its conception all the way to its
general release. The movie follows Dr.
Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and
the beautiful French ctyptologist Son
phic Neveu (Audrey Tautou) on a fast—
paced, intrigueshlled murder mystery
rife wIth narrow escapes from French
authorities and (questionably accurate)
references to great works otarr.

Dan Brown’s book practically dcs
livered director Ron Howard a movie
on a silver platter, with its cinematic
writing style allowing readers to easily
follow along from scene to scene. Yet
the 149-Ininute movie fills paInfuily

short. Tom Hanks lacks the under-
stated, scholarly sex appeal that Brown
emphasizes in Langdon throughout
the book. Tautou, so enchanting in
films like Amelie, boldly takes on the
task of handlIng the extensive English
dialogue, but the effort appears so great
that it detracts from what should be
an emotionally loaded role The only
redeeming part of the film is watching
Sir Ian McKellen camp it up as the Da
Vineisobscsscd Sir Leigh Teabing.

All in all, TIM Da Vimi Code success
fully proves only one point: the bookjs
always better than the movie.

(1998)

Sweet but not shocking

In this brief, lou/ekey but interest-
rng documentary, Marlene Booth tells
the story or growing up as a Jew in Des
Moines, Iowa. Noting that her par-
ents grew irp as ostracized minorities
whereas her children are almost fully
accepted, she decided to document her
life as a case in the middle"

Do not go to this movie expecting
a great deal of excitement or drama.
While Marlene faces the iisual' issues of

TUESDAY

a girl who does not feel she entirely fits
in with her peers, and there are a few
stories of some interest about her and
her family’s adventures with their dual
Jewish and Iowan identity, hcr troubles
related to her Judaism are relatively
few and not particularly remarkable.
The problems of growing up Jewish in
Iowa rarely seem to rise above the level
of mild discomfort. The closest thing
to drama comes during a brief dispute
about allowing Jews into a country
club.

Still, the movie is warm and lovable,
and contains a good number orendears
ing moments.There's a very cute bit in
which the young Marlene, distraught
that the Ellis Islandtmandated name
Booth doesn’t sound terribly Jewish,
starts pretending her name is Finkcl-
stein and even develops a family tree.

Much of the footage is old home
movies from Booth’s childhood, and as
such Is blurry and shaky. But the docu-
mentary is welltedited, making good
use of old and new footage and deliw
ering a lot of content in a short span
of time.

Above all, the film is short. It is
hard to begrudge too much the failings
of any movie that ads for less than an
hour of your time. Yidl iii (/7: Mold/c is
an entertaining and sweet reminiscence
on growing up.
