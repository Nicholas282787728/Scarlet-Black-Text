Do not address me while you are naked

I'm just going to come right out and say
it. I'm awkward. In case you hadn't noticed
from my column title, subject matter or your
own personal strained interactions with iire in
the loggra or Grille, I am essentially bereft of
social graces. But i
get by. I take com—
fort in the knowl-
edge that many
of my peers share
my handicap, and
we delight in each
other's company,
having bizarre
nonelinear discussions about lizard eye herpes
and the like.

Unfortunately, there is still one social sini—
ation in which my sense of humor cannot
overcome the intensity of my awkwardness:
streaking.

Don’t get me wrong. I have a healthy ap-
preciation for gratuitous nudity. l was delighted
when I transferred to Grinnell and found that,
at this campus, streakers are cheered, whereas
at Wellesley they were prornptly arrested by
the campus police, The first time I saw the
swim team streak exuberantly down the North
Campus loggia one balmy spring night, chants
ing and screaming,I felt a profound sense of
respect for these people who loved their bed

ies and hated the Man enough to stage such a
spectacle tor all ofcampus to sec

1 also recognized my own need for a healthy
distance from the horde, and scurried off into
the shadows of Mac Field to observe from a
distance.

My apprecia-
tion of streakeis,
much like irry
appreciation of
bears, is contin-
gent upon my
ability to maintain
a safe distance and
avoid direct interaction. As such, my first eve
pcrience with streakers was arguably my best,
because I knew no one involved.

But the more time i spend at Grinnell, the
more people 1 meet, and the greater the probe
ab' ty that someone I know will be ensconced
within the gyrating throng of nakedness. To
compensate for this, I avoid close interactions
with streakcrs, moving quickly yet nonchae
lantly aside at the first sound of an approach
mg horde, Unfortunately, one lovely day last
spring, during the track team’s publicity cam-
paign for the Dick meet,I underestimated the
size of the group and returned to my business
a little bit too early.

A friend and I were walking down the

noun

south Campus loggia toward Hain to leave
harassing notes on our animal friends’ white
board Suddenly, we heard the telltale shout
ofa streaking squad (i believe it was “lock up
your daughtersl"), followed shortly by a llootl
ofnudity spilling out the Loose loggia doors,

We quickly escaped through the closest
doors to watch the scene from the relative
safety of Haines beach, We watched what we
thought were the last ofthe strcakers run past
)amcs and ventured hack into the loggia, As 1
reacircd into my pocket for my Pecard wallet,
I realized that we had made a dire mistake.

A subgroup ofstreakers had run into Read,
and as they reemerged
into the loggia, my worst
streakingerelated nights
mare came true. I instinet
lively turned my gaze to~
ward the commotion, only
to see Calvin Heiling ’08
(Younker 9315) whom I
had known for only about a
month. As soon as he saw
me, he looked directly at
me and shouted, “Lindsay, come to the Dick!"

To this day, I have incredible difficulty a r
trculating my feelings at that exact moment. It
was as though an atomic bomb of awkwardr
ncss had detonated within me, and the shock

it was as though an atomic bomb
olawkwardnesr had detonated
within me, and lheshotlt wave
continued to radiate out through
all ofmysotlal interactions.

wave continucd to radiate out through all of
my social interactions throughout the rest or
the (lay.

sot months later, the day finally came that
lwas able to put aside the awkwardness to dis-
cuss the event wirlr Calvin. I'm not really sure
what 1 was expecting, ifl thought perhaps he
would laugh, or oftcr an informal apology. In
reality, he merely sat in silence for a few mos
ments (a somewhat cruel gesture to make (or
ward someone as unbearably awkward as my
self), then said, “I really don't understand why
it's awkward for you ifyou're not the one who’s
naked."

Maybe he was right.
Maybe it is all in my head,
and there really is no rea-
son for me to feel intimi—
dated by random nudity.
Maybe this realization will
allow me to have a greater
appreciation for sneakers,
and to even develop the
presence of mind to come
up with a snappy come-
back to those naked people who decide to ad-
dress me in the futirre.

I doubt it. 1 know that 50 percent of my
friends have penises, but I still never expect the
oneeeyed monster to look me in the face,

 

Seek to translate

Last weekend, I discussed the SEE]? article “Wanted:
American Students" (sop 22, 2006) with some or my Ameri-
can friends. I found out that Am 'lCtln students are also face
trig similar diilicrrltics [to international students] in lnlcl'ncllng
with American students.

ln fact,while some international students felt uneas among
domestic students because they lack topics ofconvei-sation, doe
mcstic students also felt that international students often talk
about cultural 1things thrt they dont understand Sometimes,
they thought that Far East students always exclude themselves
from others and are hard to approach. In addition, while we
blame Americans for their lack ofinterest, my domestic friends
said that instead, they were afraid to bombard us with “stupid
questions" that we have to answer all the time.

Therefore, it is my understanding now that integration of
domestic and international student communities on campus
requires a mutual effort and communication is necessary; and
thus, when the president anSIA boldly claimed that "Unless
[international srudcnts] are like them, [and] are Americanized;
[domestic snrdcnts] arcjust not in!erestcd,"I felt that her claim
was not justifiable because she is blaming Americans students
alone and discounted that we international students are also
part of the Grinncll community and bears responsibility to the
harmony on campus.

Now, the campus should widen the road to domestic and
international integration. Multicultural groups on campus have
to organize more activities where, in addition to drinks and
cookies, students can enjoy a cultural experience through cul-
tural sharing. and l think one ofthe most feasible ways would
be to include short presentations by international students dur-
ing ISO/ASIA study breaks. International students, in turn,
would have to invite their American peers to participate and to
produce a welcoming environment for them.

After all, all Grinncllians want to become educated global
citizens, and neither side can achieve this goal by cxclllding
themselves from the other.

Gorng eye for eye

President Bush and his cxtrcmc right-wing apologists de-
t'cnd the rise of cxn'cme interrogation methods (torture ifyou
please) by wheeling out a straw man. This is an evil-doer rcr-
rorisr that has sccrct knowledge that irforcetl from him (they
are not yet pteparcd to say “lrcr") will savi; millions upon mil-

lions of our fellow cit crrs from a hoi'r 1r: death from some
catastroph vdcsrructirc act

I propose simple solution to rhi- hypothetical situation
(“i potlrclrcal" being the word that President Bush used in his

- s conference to disparage any probing questions). Coir
, houltl enact a law thrt, in the above suggested situation,
author es the president to sanction the use of airy means, [or
true included, to secure information that will save the day—so
to 5| ak.

To ensure tlrar it is only used in such a situation, the law
should further state that after such torture has been admin-
istered, it will be the responsibility or the president to dem-
onstrate—beyond ri shadow of a doubt-that millions oflivcs
have indeed been saved because he has authorized this k d of
treatment ofa human being.

The law should further provide that the president is \an
able to provide such proof. he and his most trusted advisors will
be subjected to the exact same methods and duration oftorture
that has been used on the suspected terrorist. You know, sort
ofan eye for an eye.

Since President Bush is so courageously certain about the
saving value of“necessary" nreans,l am certain he will agree to
this compromise.

Pro-Israel absurd

After reading Alex Mullers keen observations on the state
ot affairs in the Middle Last, 1 was prompted to write a letter
in the intercst of highlighting some of the absurdities of his
proposal. Basically, Mr. Muller's argument deviates little from
the hawklsh chauvinrsm of the 01’ “might makes right" school
ofroreign policy.

ln this ca c, ifIsracl had not acquiesced (presumably as the
iesultof Aineiicrn pit urc) ind withdrawn from tcrrirorics it
had been illegally occup ng (in violation of UN Resolutions
242 int] 425), the problems .rciny US troops in Iraq would be
either non cxr tutor at least inconscqucnrial.

Not only is tl s rather simplistic argument raise historically,
but by its very uarur-e emphasizes a foreign policy based on a
notion of “might makes right," regardless of the moral aiubir
gu ies oi‘its application,

If Israel had not withdrawn from the Sinai Peninsula in
1979, pe -c with Egypt would have been impossible hostilities
would have likely continued and escalated into 21 much larger
conﬂict involving the whole of the Middle East, rl not the
icstofthcworltl. lnstcati or pcacewllh Egyptialbcita ‘cold’

oncierr Muller would have liked Menachcru Begin to rebull
Iimiuv Carter and ’\iiw:u Sadilt 2“ Camp Dru rd, ostensrblr be
cause men l/lfm n yarn lei o/n a 71/“! v Iii/tr a strong military pres-
ence rllegallr occupying the Sinai Peninsula would somehow
thwart the net .uious activities ofrnsrugcnts in war torn lriq.

To posit such a simplistic causal relation as the explanation
for such complex problen157thc sectarian violence plaguing
American forces in lraq and the growing tensions between l-le-
zbollah and Israel—betrays an ignorance of the fundamentrl
historical factors that led to the development of these prob-
lcrns.

American troops are being killed in Iraq not because Israel
withdrew from the Sinai in 1979 and from southern Lebanon
in 2000. American casualties and sectarian violence are the
unfortunatc result of, among other things, the destruction and
destabilization oflraq endemic to almost four years of morally
reprehensible occupation by the United States Armed Forces.

Moreover, Mr. Muller reduces the rationale behind Amerir
can pressure oflsrael to wrthdraw from illegally occupied tern
ritoiies to an emascularing appeasement of“Arab and Muslim
rage," as ifthis “rage" was ofa fundamentally irrational nature,
warranting little attention.

In doing so, Mullet trivializes the legitimate grievances
held by the sovereign nations adversely affected by the illegal
occupation of their territory by another military power. The
United States did not pressure Israel in 1979 to appease "Arab
and Muslim rage”; pressure was put on Israel in the interest of
promoting a just and lasting peace with Egypt, a peace founded
on a cessation of hostilities and the mutual recognition of In’
tcr'national borders

Ultimately, Mr. Muller's valiant proposal tor a foreign poli-
cy “that places security above popularity" reveals nothing more
than the conscious privileging or American and lsraeli lives at
the obvious expense ol'all others. And he wonders why America
spends so much time appeasing “Arab and Muslim rage".
