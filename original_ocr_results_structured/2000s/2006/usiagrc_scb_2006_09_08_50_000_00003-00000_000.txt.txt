Bad list of off-campus students
delays Joint Board election

A problem with SGA’s list ctottlcampus students
led to the decision to postpone the Joint Board elccv
tlon from Monday to Wednesday.

SGA Administrative Coordinator (AC) Nick
Blencowe '08, who oversees elections, said that on
Sunday night it became apparent that there were 200
more names on the off-campus lists than there should
have been.

A number of ﬁISt’yeﬂl’S were on the List, as well
as high school students who‘ve taken classes at the
college.

The ITS employee who oversees such problems,
Wayne Twitchcll, was at a conference on the West
Coast. Twrtchell tried to help Blencowe over the

phone but wasn’t able to help from ottrcampus.

“I couldn’t do anything,”Blcncowc said. “[Twitch-
ell] couldn't do anything either, because he wasn't into
the network. It [was] just too much of a mess. We
decided to move everything to Wednesday."

Election Board did consider holding omeampns
elections as scheduled on Monday and offrcdmpus
elections later, but rejected that plan,

As a result of the delay, the Student Campaign
for Increased Political Engagement (SCIPE) was able
to hold candidate forums on Tuesday SCIPE didn’t
contact SGA about the forums until Monday, but ore
ganized and held them Tuesday night.

Expensive Noyce addition to be done in spring

av ERIN MCKEE

As students enter the 540 million Joseph F. Rosenfleld '25 Cam-
pus Center, they’re standing across the street from an even more

cxpcnsivc building project.

Because ofthe renovation, .nany ofthe classes held in the Noyce

building had to be relocated. Noise, dust and vibrations have also
been an issue, especmlly dnnng the ﬁrst three weeks otAugust. "I

live a little less from breathing in the poisonous fumes," said Jonav

The college is currently building a large
addition to the Noyce Science Center as part
of the second phase of the building’s construc-
tionThc addition is expected to he ﬁnished
in May 2007, after which other parts of the
building will undergo a yearlong renovation.

The new addition will include more class-
rooms and laboratories, a greenhouse and a
tworstory math and science libraryTotal cost
is projected at 344 million,

The new construction, or Phase Two, be-
gan in lane 2005. Henry Walker, computer
Science and the building liason for Noyce,

suid that the Noyce construction is largely on schedule. "There are
“When you have that
runny people, you can do some juggling” Walker is conﬁdent that

85 people working on that area,“wallecr said.

the entire process will he ﬁnished in the time planned

than Lee '10, who participated in Grinnell
Science Program and is taking two classes In
Noyce. “But that was in the summer, I don't
really heal the constiuction now."

Others agree that while construction
has been inconvenient in the past, rhc situa-
tion has improvcd as the project progressed.
“There were problems last semester when
they were demolishing and it was loud," said
Keri Kornelson, Math/Statistics. “Coin-
parativcly, wc havc it easier than some otrhe
other departments now. "

The ﬁrst phase ofNoyce, named for Intel

co-fmlnder Robert N. Noyce '49, was completed in 1997. Phase Two
of the project also included improvemcnts to the Cunard Environ-

Gender-equal
class of 2010

By Becca CHOLAS’WOOD AND CATlE ScotT

A number of prominent articles and studies re-
leased over past months have examined the phenomcc
non ota gap in performance between men and women
in higher education. Many liberal arts colleges have as
many as 60 women for every 40 men, and Grinnell
itself has a female majority.

The class otzom didn't get the message.

This year’s first-year class is only 51 percent fe
male, a striking departure tram national trends. Ad-
mission ofﬁcials aren't certain what led to the balance,
but aren’t complaining.

“I don’t know ofa single liberal arts college in thc
country, a top place, that’s that close," said Dean of
Admission Jim Sumner. “Women really dominate lila-
oral arts colleges."

With only one class so balanced, some students
have not noticed a dieterancc in campus dynamics,

“This is the first I've heard of this," said Jessica
Bralley '10, “I don't know, 1 don't think it will be any
diffelent."

Thc other major change was that the class of 2010
was the first class for which international student ads
missions were done on a “need sensitive" policy.

Admissions hoped that by admitting ntotc wealthy
international students, they could better support those
who couldn‘t pay their own way.

This year's international class is slightly smallel
than previous years, something that Sumner said
wasn‘t expected.

“There are slightly fewer [international students],
said Sumner But to a certain extent that is our fault.
What we thought was going to happen was, by ad-
mitting fewer and giving them better aid, a higher
percentage would say yes.

The 29 intcrnational first-years include the
school's first Cambodian and Uzbckistani students.
