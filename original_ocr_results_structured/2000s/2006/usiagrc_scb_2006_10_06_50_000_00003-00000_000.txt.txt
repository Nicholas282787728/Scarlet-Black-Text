Heroic in normal life

Feedback, mm. from p. 1

Likewise, Arherton‘s teat-hers were impressed by his dedir
cation and enrhnsiasrn “Matt was optimistic and deliberately
uphcar toward any work he did here," John Stone, Computer
Science, said, “He smiled a lot for a Crinnell student."

When critiquing and eliminating eontesranrs on “Who
Wants to be a Superhero?" Stan Lee emphasized the impor-
tance of always being helpful and considerare otorhers. Ather-
ton took these lessons ro hearr, “Being a superhero isn‘t about
nipping ort roots, it's about helping orher people," Arherton
said “You don't need a costume to do that."

Wirh his lifelong fascination with superheroesiand espe
cially Lee’s creationsithe chance to meet his idol and fulfill his
dream was a once-in-a-lit’etime oppominity.

“I decided that I really had re go all rhe way, and put in as
much energy as humanly possible ro make rhrs happen,"Arhen
ron said. "I eouldn'r really think or any reason for me [o be on
(ch planet other than to do the show."

Willigeonwuachi was not surprised by Arherton’s cur
rent happiness. “I’m sure he feels like us some calling or his,"
Willig-onwuaehi said. “It’s something hes pursued tor along
time,”

Though Atlicrmn
has less time and more
responsibility after
winning the show, he is
rhrilled Lee recognized
him as a superhero.
— “superheroes have ale
Ways challenged rm: to bc herrer, to make rhc right decisions. to
be creative, to use my imagination, to have a moral code and re
try to think ofothcr people,"Atherton said. “i think that’s what
superheroes do, they think or orher people before rhey thinlt
of theuisclvcs. Sometimes it will get them into trouble, and it
has gotten me into trouble, but I wouldn't want to live life any
orher way."

”i wouldn’t want to live life any
olhti way”

High aid to remain

Tuition, cam. from p. 2

With that of East Coast institutions like Amherst, Swarth-
more and even Harvard,

Despite the tnistccs' enthusiasm for the tuition increases,
SGA President Chris Hall ’07 is concerned that “the [inn
creased] sticker shock mighr be enough to deter middle and
loWr [income] students from coming here.“

SGA Assistant Treasurer Brad Bishop agreed. “Grinncll
has consistently attracted students in the low end of
the middle-income bracket," he said. “I feel like that could
change."

sumncr is lcss concerned about demographic changes
because ofGrinnell’s needeblind admissions policy and com-
mitment to meeting domestic students’ ﬁnancial need. While
comprehensive fees have increased by 39 percent in the past
six years, Sumner said the student body has become more
diverse, with more first-generation college students, more
people of color and more Asian students,

Osgood is also convinced that the tuition changes will not
arreer the demographies orinconnna classes “Ifwe saw a sly
niﬂcnnt impact on the student bodyTas a resulr ofthc upcom-
ing tuition hikeJ," he said, “we would rethink the policy.”

In fact, several years ago the trustees instructed Sumner
to increase the number orwealthy applicants. The college has
done exactly that, but Sumner said the composition of the
studenr body has nor changed.

Despite these assurances, Hall hopes to gauge student
opinion on the matter before determining whethci SGA will
organize students against the increase.

Korver is wellraware of the impoitancc of Grinnell's
commitment to meet demonstrated need. “[I] would not have
come to Grinnell were it nor tor a generous aid package," he
said.\1\’hile his long-term perspective as a trustee has led him
to support rhis series orrncreases, he empathizcs with cur
rent students as well. “Anything to do with tuition has serious
tradeoffs,“he said.

Students have “been beaten over the head” with peer institutions

Peers, cant. from p. i

argues should he equivalent ro our peers. There hrs been no
major effort to persuade students about why this should be so,

dnd the arguments rhat have been made are unsatisfying.

Even when comparisons are fair, they can be misused. SGA
Pl‘CSldCl‘ii’ Chris Hall ’07 reﬂected the thoughts of many stu-
dents when he said that references to “peer institutions” have

come too fast and furious in recentyeais.“We’vejustbeen beats
on over the head with that term," Hall said. “Therejust needs to
he a much more eonsideiare and thoughtful discourse herween '
students and administrators."
