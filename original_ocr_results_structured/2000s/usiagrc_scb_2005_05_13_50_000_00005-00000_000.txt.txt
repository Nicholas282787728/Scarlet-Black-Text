New for
next year

Students leaving in the spring
will come across several chang-
es come fall, here is a preview

Sub‘Free dorms: This past
year, Smith Hall was the only
substance-free dorm on cam-
pusr Next year, it will be joined
by an East Campus dorm, the
newly christened Kcrhsaw
Hall (for story, see page 3). La-
zicr Hall was originally chosen,
but Jen Krohn and Tom Crady
changed their mind after stu—
dent input and survey results.

Floor composition: Floor draws have been
discontinued after a one-year experiment.

Dining Plans: All residence hall dining plans
will now include ﬁve guest passes next year. The
“Breakfast Bch gcs to Cd'plltn means nine ortor-
let will be moving from Cowles and Qlad [0 meme
IngclaSscs.Tlicrc's n ncwoprion {a purchase 5100 in
Dining Dollars at a discounted rate.

Buffcrdnys: Mondays will be the only pro-anal
buffer day next year, but SGA is lobbying to add
Thoradtys and Fridays to the list for future years.
The buffer days were a recommendation of the
Mental Health Task Force, and were supported by
a resolution in Joint Board, a student initiative last
semester and the Committee for Student Life.

New PEC: The new Physical Edu-
cation Complex will be entirely ﬁnished
by the beginning of the next school year.
That means that fall sports will have
their locker rooms in the new PEC.
The. basketball teams will also have a
home gymnasium for the entire season
this year.

Student wages: According to
an allreampur interview by Pam
Sittig, Assistant Director of Stun
dent Financial Aid, student wages
will increase actoss the board next
year. New wages will range from
$6.60 to $735 per hour. Student
protests against the 645 percent
tuition increase this year had de-
manded an increase in student
wages.

Noyce Construction:
After classes end this
year, the northern wing of
Noyce will be torn down
for a new pliasc of con-
struction. While the new
wing will be two stories,
it also won’t be done until
the end of the 200672007
school year.

Tuition increases: Nothing’s
been announced yet, but more hikes
are anticipated. The recently ape
proved strategic plan includes a pas—
sage alluding to price increases to
raise tuition revenue. Trustees have
pledged to improve communication
with students about upcoming tu-
ition increases.
