Jay Marcus, a Republican from Fairfleld, town, is challenging in
cumbent Congressman Leonard Boswell for his seat in the House of
Representatives. This is the third time each man has run for the pusie
tion, but the first time ihey have faced each other as majotrparty an»
didates. Boswell, a Democrat, was elected in 1996. That year, Marcus
ran as the Natural Law Patty’s nominee; in 1998, hc sought the Re»
publican party nomination but lost to state senator Larry McKibbcn
of Marshalltown.

On the surface, Marcus looks like a traditional Republican. He
quotes Ronald Reagan on his campaign
website, supports a reduction in capital gains
taxes, and says that “ifGod had intended us to
live in such a permissive society, he would have
given us the Ten Suggestions." Boswell, by
contrast, is a fairly liberal Democrat by most
standards. He favors capital gains axes, most
gun control proposals, and aborrion rights in
most cases.

Both Boswell and Marcus oppose the sac
called “partiaihirth abortion” procedure, and
Boswell voted for a bill banning the practice.
Marcus runs to the right of Boswell on the
issue. “I'm against abortion once we detctminc,that there is a life
there,” he said, He supports legal abortion in the first trimester of
pregnancy only. While he is sensitive to a woman's right to choose. he
said, “we always balance choice against other values in society,"

But there Is more to Marcus than traditional Republican rhetoric
He opposes capital punishment and supports research into renewable
energy. two positions which seem more il\-illlc with the Democrats 7
or perhaps the Natural Law Party.

Indeed, Matcus’ candidacyseems to be an interesting mesh of Re-
publican and Natural Law Party ideas. His campaign website states
that “government should be funding only programs that have been
proven effective by competent scientific evidence." While the appeal
for limited governmcitt is classically Republican, the emphasis on Sclc
entirically proveu solutions for problems is a Natural Law Parry trade»
mztrlt.

Marcus has made a campaign issue out ofthc state Farm Bureau,
which he says ctiiinot effectively represent the .urcrests ofsmali fnrin.

Boswell’s reaction to the farm issue was not available :5 ofpress
time, but according to the Project vote smart website, he does sup.

Marcus agrees with Vice president Al Gore on the need for renew.
able energy research. but disagrees with tapping the strategic oil te»
serve. The government plans to release 50 million barrels of oil, he
said, while the united states consumes 13.5 million barrels per day.
“When you look at all that, it's more a politiai ploy than anything
else, and it's not going to do anything in the long term,” Marcus said.

Marcus, like many in the Natural Law Party,
stresses preventive approaehes to problems. This
includes finding alternative means ofreducing the
Country's dependence on oil. “The direction for
the Future is renewable energy,” he said. Wind
power, ethanol, and hydrogen are among such
resources, and Marcus said he would like iowa ro
beoeme a leader in alternative fuel research. “let's
become the renewable energy capital ottheworld,"
he said.

Again according to the Project vote smart
website, Boswell supports alternative iuel research.
He also wants to strengthen rhe Clean Air Act

Staff Writer

In a rally organized by crinnellstudenrs, diirrocn Ralph
Nader supporters from across town gathered Tuesday out»
side Des Moines‘s Democratic Parry headquarters to pro
test their candidate's cxclusion from the presidential de-
hates.

The ﬁrst ofthrcc scheduled presidential debates was
to be held that evening, featuring two orthe six candidates
who could theoretically win us. presidency in the Nov. 7
election. Earlier in the year, the Commission on Presiden-
tial Debates resolved to close the debatcs to candidates
pulling under 15 percent in national polls. Nader, the Green
Party's presidential nominee and third-most popular cane
didate. has mptuted between 3% and 5% support in re-
cent surveys.

The demonstrators, comprised of {out Giinnellians.
four Simpson College students, one Iowa state student,
and two Des Moinesarea Green Party supporters, fanned
across Fleur Drive holding signs saying “Democracy is on
Death Row" and chanting “Let Ralph Debate.”

Shannon Anderson ’02, a Gtinnell Students fctNadet
coordinator and the primary organizer of the event, con-
ducted interviews with two Des Molnes TV-stations.

Democratic Party representatives said that they have
no influence over the Commission. which is a private, non»

The Commission, formed in 1988. is co-chaittd by

variety ofprivateotimpanies, Speaking for the oftiee, Chris-
topher Moody, coordinator of Gore's campaign in Iowa,
said he had not known this,

“I don't thinkwc havc :in opinion on thejackson hill,"
he added. “The Vice President supports the decision of
the commission."

Moody also said that though rhe presidential campaigns
had influenced the Commission's decision on the format
of the debates, inclusion of candidates is an issue decided
independently.

Neither Democrats not Gtccns. interestingly, believed
that Nader's appearance in the debates would cut into sup
port for Cote in the general election.
