Pineapple
Express
' (2008)

Stoner movie his hard, often
watching Pineapple express, you might

wonder iryou’ve seen it before, more likely, you’ve
seen one otits many inspirations. Ifyou can die
gest the fact that you’re not being dished out any
original rare, the film delivers plenty of fun.

writren by seth Roger] and Evan Goldberg
—who turned their adolescenr agonies into
Superbad, a charming smutfest about three horr
monally freaked-out teenage boys—vPineapple
Express delivers plenty of laughs.

The two scieenwriters have become major
since then, in particular Rogan, who also starred
in the family-values comedy Knocked Up and
has recently lent his voice to one-too-many chil—
dren's movies. In some respects Pineapple Ex~
press plays out like a louder, nastier, more violent
and ostensibly adult follow-up to superhad. The
exception is Rogan, who had a supporting part
in the first film as a slacker cop, has moved tar
enough up the studio food chain to now take a
starring role,

Essentially, the plot revolves around the
blissfully funny James Franco as saul, the drug
supplier who finds himselfrunning for his barely
cognizant life with steady customer Dale (Ros
grin), a 25ryearrold daring a high school senior.
They’re running because Dale witnessed a drug
related murder and then dropped a precious joint
(a joint of the particularly rare and exquisite
brand of weed the ﬁltn is titled after) at the scene
ofthe crime. Unsure whether they're in a comedy
or a drama, Gary Cole and Rosie Perez play the
ruthless criminals who want the Witness dead,

The entire cast delivers smart performances
(as ironic ‘as that sounds), and the whole ﬁrst half
of the movie brims with the humor we’ve come
to expect from Regen. some or the gags involw
ing the side-winding conversational riffs are "T
credibly funny When Dale explains to his denier
that he's a process server, he rcplies,“Yon’re a ser-
vant.> Like, a butler?" As written, that line could
go either way, but Franco—ﬁllly invested in this
stoncr’s stoncr—makes it singt

There are two aspects of this movie that

keep it only a sorso, rather than great, stoner
movie. First, it goes on for an extra 15 minutes
too long. A movie like this needs a running time
of less than 100 minutes to be effective. Second,
the movie never really makes up its mind about
its genre, Around the midpoint, “Pineapple Ex
press" falls apart and keeps ﬁlling, and the come
edy, spiced with considerable, unevenly effective
violence in that ﬁrst hour, goes out the window.
and in comes all the gore and the bonercruncha
m .
g All in all, don’t expect a well thoughrrout,
insightful movie. Just go in seeking a few laughs,
and ifyou are willing to take in all of the movie’s
absurdity and suspend your disbelief, you'll at
least be entertained.

the United States. After writerrdirector Joshua
Maiston created the script for this, his debut
ﬁlm, he spent time in both Columbia and the
Columbian neighborhoods of New York before
ﬁlming.

The time spent there, combined with the
documentary style of the ﬁlm, inﬁises every
frame with the heart and emotional honesty
lacking in other “issue"themcd ﬁlms like Trafﬁc,
Steven soderbcrgh's 2000 film about drug traf-
ficking, or Rendition, Gavin Hood’s 2007 ﬁlm
about the CLAs use oterrraordinnry rendition.

Those ﬁlms, as is the hip trend in Hollywood
today, embrace a multirvocal, mulrisrorylinc ap-
proach. Marston smartly bucks this trend—he
seems to understand and appreciate that focus-
ing on one incredibly rich storylinewith a strong
and umque character at its center, can produce
ﬁlm that truly affects us.

At the center ofMarston’s ﬁlm resides his (lr
rle character: 17-year-old Maria Alvarez. Maria
lives in a small Colombian village near Bogota,
and works at a ﬂower factory, stripping thorns
from rose stems. It’s a thankless, monotonous
job, but it’s onlya part ofMaiia's deadrend, caged
existence—and we can see that she wants to, or
maybe needs to, escape. She lives in a crowded
house with her older, unmarried, suiglermother
sister, and nor-so—bright boyfriend. Maria, as
played by the luminous Catalina sandina Morer
no. is not only intelligent but also courageous and
captivating.

Early in the film, when Maria and her boy-
friend are out {or some alone time, they stop by
an abandoned building. In a moment that tells
us much about who she is, Maria impulsively de—
cides she wants a boner view of her town, and
climbs up the wall of the abandoned building to
the roof Her boyfriend is too afraid to follow

Maria knows then that he’s not ready to fa-
ther their unborn child

Rebutftng his awkward and poorly delivered
marriage proposal, Maria turns to how she’ll

Adapted from the novel by irvine Welsh,
Trainspotting stars Ewan Mcoregor as Mark

You're intmduccd to Renton and his SCIEW’

Ralltont Sick Boy has a penchant for James Bond
and Sean Connery impressions. Goofball spud,
oblivious to everything and everyone, walks into
a job interview after taking some speed.

The last two friends, Tommy and oeghie,
have somewhat more normal lifestyles. Tommy
is a peaceful guy. He likes playing football, work-
ing our, and making sex tapes with his girlfriend.
Begbie is a violent and shortstempercd drunk
who looks down on those who take hard drugs.
Throughout the ﬁlm, he purposely gets into bar
ﬁghts with people who haven't even said a word
to him,

As you follow Renron and his friends from
heroin den to rehab, crime to court, you can easily
see the artistic excellence of Danny Boyle's direc-
tion, It borders on surrealistic at times and seam-
lessly mixes fantasy and reality

For example, in one of the opening scenes
of the film, Renton tries to retrieve some speed
that he dropped into one of the ﬁlthiest toilets
in EnglandThe film enters a sequence where he
dives into a toilet and swims around underwater.
Later In the ﬁlm, in a scene of Renton's with-
drawal from heroin, Boyle makes the atpcricnccs
of his hallucinations of his girlfriend and friends
seem frighteningly real.

Boyle mixture offantasy and reality requires a
lot of skill, but his nearly ﬂawless fusion ofcome-
dy and tragedy really makes this movie powcrﬁll.
Without feeling awkward or forced, Trainspot-
ting gracefully moves from heroin overdose and
death to clumsy crimes and embarrassing sexual
situations. Itwill leave you broken. overwhelmed,
and strangely enough, ﬁlled with the joy ofbeing
alivet

Tomi/among, though weighty at times, is a
lot ofrun,and,unlike your typical drug ﬁlm, it re-
spects you as a vieweriit never shoves the hack-
neyed message of “don't do drugs, kids" down
your throat. Trainspotting spits in your face, puts
a cigarette out on your arm, punches you around,
and says, “How's that for a message?"
