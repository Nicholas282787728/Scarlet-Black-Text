I would like so sespond so Ms, lunges lesses fsom she pen, a
edision ofshe son. I shink shese need so he a rev shings eleesed up.

To pus is simply, immediasely afses seading shis losses 1 was lefs
wondesing execsly whas is is shas Junge eapeeis. Ho slammed sevenil
longessanding feasuses in she 5&3 shas 1, along wish many oshes
ssudenss, enjoy, andl wondeswhas he wanss fsom a eampus newspm
pes shas would iussify his words

peshaps i am nsissaken, hus a campus newspapes is iuss that~a
papes psoviding eampus news. as news on eampus, ifyou will. He
made a sefesenee so she offending psesenee of “usually insignificans
evens" (“Alsesnauve spsing Break," “Proﬁts Down," ese.) and yes
seems myssified as so why she edisoss and ssalrwnsess would feel shas
a complcx analysis of Massin Lushes Kings life shouldn't be psinsed
alongside she assiele feasused lass week. Now, dons ges me wsong, l
have woslds ofsespees fos Di. King and all he has done fes she good
of humanisy shiough his aesions and seaehings, husl ssill rail so see
why a weekly pulalseasion should feel sesponsihle fos psinsing pages
of masesial (fos is would sake many pages so do she sopie iussise) on
a sopie shas can he seseasehed as one’s leisuse in Busling, Afses all,
shouldn’t we save some soom fos infosming ssudenss ofways shas
shey ean sassy on Dr. Kings message ofunisy, such as snking sime
ous ofous lives hy snveling so Mexico so help people in sheis sime of
need?

Junge shen psoeeeds
so slam she Arts session
fos devosing an ensise
page so salk about mov.
ies. He esisieiaes shis see.
sion hemuse is psesenss
she “supposed
Gsinnellians pesspeesive
on movies," I did a lissle
seseaseli inso shis masses
and diseovesed shas she
aushosofdse assiele, Joe
Miehaels ‘02, is indeed
a ssudens as csinnell. is
is my pessonal obsems
sion shas she aniele dc»
livesed exactly whas is
psemise . a Grinnellian’s
sake on movies, So again
I fail so see she psolalem.

The lasssweepingassaeks same on swo eolumns whieh have been
asound fos quite some sime. lunge is seemingly quiie upses by dse
”pettysbourgeoisie”sness of people assending sessausanis. God for
laid. May He also foslaid shas we have any clue whas is on she menu
os whas mighs he good so ssy should we eves enses sueh an smblishs
mens, I’m sossy, bus I don't know soo many people who feel upses
aheus ssading she monosony ofdimng in Quad fos someshing he.
sides haked sesod and lensil chili evesy onee in a while. And as fos
Nieks eolsinsn. whieh l have ofsen found funny and ensessaining, I
suggess shas Junge try aesually seeding is fsom sime so sime and ask
himself if he is ssuly supposed so sake is so sesiously. someshing sells
me shas Niels isn’s quite so milisandy proscommercizllsrn as lunge's
esisique seems so imply.

l hope nos so sound ensisely critical onoun lessen sam, hus
give me a hseak You admis so having only a semesses undes yous
hels, hus I've gos seven. And I have leasned a few shings in my sime
hese. I've leasned shas is doesn's do much good so bitch so people
ahous how you aren't sepsesensed unless you haek is up wish aesion.
If you dosis like she papes, ssy wsising a eolumn and see ifyou eau
ones is someshing you feel is laeks. Or ssass yous own papes. But

You admit to havmg only a
semester under your belt,
but I’ve got seven. And I
have learned a few things in
my time here. I've learned
that it doesn’t do much good
to bitch to people about how
you aren’t represented un«
less you back it up with ac
tion.

Deas 5&3,

Lass week Sam luuge wsose a lesses deplosing she faes shas she

I'm willing so exchange money. Luckily 99,99 peseens os so, people
in Amesiea feel she same wayl do, so shis maskes exchange is allowed
so oonsinue.

While I would like so eonsinue a diseussion ahous she existence

mose shan lissening so diseussion ofusilisy sheosy (sossy Ms. Mont»

Reades," and neishes "sessanmns" nor “food" make a single appears
anee in she index.) csinnell is u-sdisionally a psogssasive college. Pres
gsessiveness does nos equate wish fullessale aeoepsanee ofall Mansian
values (or misundesssood insespsesasions sheseof) and a seieesion of

Dear ITS

Students speak out
aboutwhat’s on
their minds in 142
words, and you’re
invited! If you have
a random rant, email
it to me at
alwnrd@grinnells2du.
After all. complain-
ing in a public forum
is always more fun -
than doing it alonei

So what does Facilities Management think they are do-

ing outside Langananyway? They began dismantling what '

looked to me like a perfectly harmless concrete slab—
right before ﬁnals week when students need quiet and
sleep the most! I assumed the idea was to ﬁnish what-
everthey were doing over winter break, but no—North
Campus is now besmirched by a construction zone, walled
off with orange plastic and apparently designed to pro—
tect us from falling into a mysterious vnid, covered by a
plywood board and cryptically labeled "HOLE." What's
next? I suppose construction resumes around midterms
week? I'm just glad I don't live in Cowles, where power
plant construction has made this year an industrial night-
mares Ii our professors insist on making this school the
stress capital of the Midwest, FM should not contribute
to the ordeal.

Lately I have found the dinning halls to be even more

frustrating than usuaL Why? For the simple reason
that there are too many people who feel that they have
the right to talk at meal times. Talking in the dinning
' hall is a major cause of social disturbances. The orderly
flow of students getting their food is destroyed when-
ever someone feels the need to stand beside the sabad
bar and have a conversation; people to stay at their
tables longer to ﬁnish conversations, making it harder
for the next wave of students to ﬁnd a place to sit; and
it causes that horrible din that nobody wants to hear.
I think that the world would be a better place if penple
would just shut up and eat while in the dinning halLs.

I sincerely doubt that the trouble is with my network
card, given the mt that every person who has switched
roams between semesters is having the exact same prob
lem that I'm having 50 while purchasing a new network
card may very well fix the problem (DHEP might recognize
it as a “nevf‘ computer, rather than a previously registered
one), blaming the iaults of the network’s spotty 1P auto-
conﬁguratian upon'the studenB network cards seems like
irresponsibly passing the buck, bath ﬁguratively and liter-
ally, It is my hope that ITS will continue to work on recti-
fying this problem, and if you dedde that the replacement
of properly operating student-owned equipment is name
sary, then it seems only fair to me that Grinnell College
should supply such equipment, since it is Grinnell [allege
that is denying me internet access because of the ﬁults in
their own system, not mine.
