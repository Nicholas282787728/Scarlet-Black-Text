Impressionism sheds light on Grinnell

av DAVID DRISCOLL

It's not often art shown at the Met makes it to Grinnell.

Claude Monet's “Chrysanthemums" is one of the few pieces
that has. A simple still life of red and white ﬂowers in a green vase
against a mottled background, the painting captures the effect of
light on the object. lts Impressionism shines through as the rapid,
tight, clearly visible brush strokes that emphasize the colors and
light over the subject. The ﬂowers glisten from the layering ofoils.

The Fauleoner Gallery’s current exhibit, “An Impressionist Eye,"
shows this and 28 other late~nineteenth and earlyrtwentieth century
paintings and sculptures, including works by Pablo Picasso, Edgar
Degas and PierrerAugmsre Renoir, All were in rhe Met and are now
displayed "along with several others donated to other museums or
under conservation. The exhibition is labeled “Impressionist," but it
extends earlier and later, with as many'posr-Impressionist pieces as
Impressionist proper.

The works were originally collected for a private home, and not
surprisingly they show domestic life, including a man reading in an
armchair in Edouard Vuillatcl's Al'ﬂzur Fan/nine Reading in In; Salon
and a couple eating in Pierre Bonnard’s Therm/mane common
theme makes it “an impmrtant Impressionist collection because of
how the pieces interact with one another," said Lesley Wright, the
director of the Gallery. “I think the opportunity to see a range of
works that a family wanted to live with is always insightful, to see
how people shape their own personal taste."

The small and somewhat obscure exhibit also illustrates the large
changes over time. Susan Straubet, Art, said,“[Vicwets] would learn
a lot, and would also enjoy a lot, about later 19tl‘rccntury French
painting and early 20th-century."

Eszrer Csicsai '07, an intern at the Gallery, said that because

these particular works are lesser—known, they “display the broad
range ofthc abilities of the artist, [so one doesn't] just pigeonhole
them into one thing.”

Csicsai thinks that these paintings are particularly interesting
because they show “how active the artistic scene was around the turn
otthe century and how much ideas were spreading and how much
cultures were mixing,"

The works are "part of the history of all cultures," Sttaubct said,
“It’s important for us to know about our own history and culture,
and that no one society or time or group has a claim to that."

The Gallery expects people to be drawn to this exhibit, particu-
larly from outside the College. “This is the sort of exhibition the
town gets very excited about, said Wright, who hopes that “[the
town] will get increasingly comfortable with coming to the Faul-
coner Gallery to see whatever it is we have."The lasr Impressionist
exhibit by the Gallery, two years ago, drew over 24,000 people, com
pared to 2,000-3,000 for an average exhibit.

The Gallery has a parallel exhibit of its own collections prints
from the same time period and by some of the same artists. It in
eludes Jacques Villon’s 1905 Normandy Farmhouse, a postrImpresr
sionist work with a green bush in the foreground, a house in the
back and a woman and trees to the right. Although more realistic
than many Impressionist works, the vibrant use of color, which takes
precedence over realistic representation, suggests an impressionist
heritage,

Sttiluber will present on the exhibit Nov" 16 and Rebecca Rabi-
now from the Metropolitan Museum ofArt will give a lecture Nov..
29 about its contcxt.

Fast Facts:

Edgar Degas heirs might have been put on aca-
demie probation ifthcy had been forced to sign Grin—
nell's academic honesty policy

When Degas died, his heirs found more than 150
pieces ot’wax, clay and plastilinc sculpnlres in his sni-
dio that were used as models for his paintings. A year
after their discovery, they authorized the creation of
bronze editions cast from the originalswhile there is
disagreement about whether Degas would have want-
ed thcsc replicas made, two ofthcsc bronze sculptures
are on display in “An Impressionist Eye," an exhibir
tion of impressionist art in the Faulconer Gallery.

Though some call these editions fakes or counter
felts, the process of posrhumously casting from origi-
nal molds is not unusual. According to curator Dan
Strong, an artist hardly ever actually casts a bronze
sculpture himseltor herself, butideally is able to over
see rhe process.

“To say that they're not Degas would also be to say
that they're not good enough," Strong said. “I think
most people agree that there is enough of Degas in
rhern that it tells us something about him as a sculpr
tor."

Strong said that the debate is not so much about
the authenticity of Degas works, but rarher rhe qualr
ity. “The thing that would he more pressing in scholr
arly circles is whether you think they’re good or not,
nor whether they’re Degas,"he said. “I've heard people
say they think [a Degas sculpture] is one ofthc ugliest
things they’ve ever seen, bllt I’ve never heard anyone
say [it’s] not Degas."

The two sculptures now in Faulconer Gallery can
be called original editions, reproductions or fakes, but
Strong said that's not the issue and emphasized their
cultural value.

“he a part of history. Whether it's right or not, or
whether you would do this with any artist, or wheth-
er a famlly now would choose ro cast a dead family
member's work, then you can debate the ethics," he
said. “But the fact of the matter is that it was done,
[and] it's a part ofart history"

From Strong’s point ofvicw, the viewers can de-
cidc how to value the pieces.

“I think to call them fake and counterfeit is miss
leading," said Strongt ”I've always approached it as
‘thctc they are and you can either take them or leave

them .
