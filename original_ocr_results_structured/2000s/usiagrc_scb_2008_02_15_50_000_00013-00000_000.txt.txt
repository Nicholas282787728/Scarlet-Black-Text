Discovering holes to new dimensions

This weeks adventure. in which our heroes explore secret dulting grounds on their continuing voyage orselrediscovery.

A friend eta cousin ofmitic—John—rccently recounted to
me a fascinating tale, whose veracity is altnost certain.

Late one sleepless Noyce night during rhe heyday of our
perpetual Age of Construction, john was utilizing the math
wing facilities, Glancing upvmrds from his throne, he noticed,
as if for the first time. a sheet of plywood covering what once
had been a secondeﬂoor bathroom window.

“It looks like that sucker isn’t really screwed in," he thought.
“It's barely held in place by tiny little plastic arms, I’ll bet 1
could take it out no problem," And he did. Like the young pmt
tagonists of Narnia, he found himself staring quite suddenly
into a world wholly different from his own.

While the bathroom shone ofbeveled plaster and burnished
tile and smelled (at best) ordisintectant and naphthalene, John
peered outward into a land orrickety ladders, exposed wires and
buckets orrivets and screws that littered the ground.

Like a parakeet that has discovered how to open his cage,
my cousins friend hopped onto the window ledge, tlapped his
wings once or twice, and flew,

John strode through Noyce, the maze orprogress, and gazed
in at the gerbils crunching problem sets on their wheels, They
would never know his freedom. Perhaps they wouldn't want
[07thcy seemed pretty happy on their wheels. He hopped
back through the wardrobe into the sterile bathroom, closing
the window behind him.

John went back several times, but on his last return, the poly
wood sheet had been bolted shut. No magical mystery landi
just a bathroom.

At first, the Forum basement ladies' room looks like any
other bathroom. But do not be fooled! As I descended the stairs
and made rnyway toward the back end orthe bathroom, I spied
something pcculiar.Thcre is a small opening benveen the back
wall and the last stall. Secret passageway? I decided to investie
gateArtcr all, a time portal is atypical as far as bathrooms go,

My heart raced as 1 peered anxiously through the space in
the walls. lvwis that stupid character who haunts horror-movie
audiences everywhere.The one who decides to take a short-cut
home. Maybe through a dark alleyway mid-rhunderstorm at
3:30 in the morning with a serial killer on the loose. Any~
thing could have been lurking behind those walls. An alien or a
homesick Tom Crady.

Instead, I discovered an oddly shaped room with a bizarre
compartment attached at the back left corner. The room its
sclfis about 7x4 and the compartment adds an additional 3x3
space. Tire smaller part is completely hidden from the main
bathroom. In order to find that secret nook,l had to walk into
the ﬁrst roonr. Tricky

currently, this space is sparsely decorated with supplies
for the FM employees who diligently and graciously beautify
our public facilities. However,1 think there are countless pos-
sibilities for this little enclave. A secret society meeting place.
A Dag storage closet. A new site tor Grinnellian Grafﬁti. it
would have been the best hiding place for a rousing game of
Hide 8c Seek, except I just revealed that to the entire campus
community

By far my favorite idea for the space: Intimate timing.

Okay, so this isn’t actu—
ally a look back on Grin—
nell’s past. But, future
generations, take heed:
100 Days can set off a flu
epidemic. In this week
in Grinnell history, the

- plague struck campus.

Get well soon, Grinnell.

Bogeyman 101: locating invading axe murderers in ARH

Rachel Fields engages in comparative, interdisciplinary scholarship: like, seriously, is Herrick freakier than the Forum?

1 am no stranger to the concept orcreepie
ness. A few weeks ago in the dining hall, I
started playing a game called “Awkward or
Not Awlnvard?,"irvherc I walked around, ob
served people rutrrung into each other, and do
cidetl whether the interaction looked painfully
uncomfortable.

Then I reels
ized I was skulke
ing around the
dining hall like a
homicidal maniac,
staring at people,
and the whole
thing took an unpleasant, ironic turn,

Combine this with the fact that I couldn't
sleep for three weeks after watching “Scream,"
and what do you have? Iryou said, “A Rect‘
pc for Finding the Foul creepiest Places on
Campus,“you're righrl And also an eerily good
guesscr.

Grinnell is a relatively safe place, but don‘t

Ediﬁce Complex

let that curb your paranoia — there are still
plenty of opportunities to encounter a ciazed
serial killer.

Ifyou'd rather eat your Paarm and remain
ignorant, well, I henceforth sever all ties with
you. Ifyou're lucky enough to still be my good

side. read on.
4. If
nized religion
isn't enough to
make you trem-
ble, the basement
or l'leitick gets
trusty spot #4 for
the scariest place at Grinnell. Mannequins
sheathed in 80's wedding dresses? Religious
texts belonging to people who later aharr
doned God for a lifc of cynicism and Hawks
eye? Vl’oodcn chairs iliat are not conducive to
hooking up? I am scared already,

3. Noyce: both rerrrtyrngly huge and filled

with people who like “cutting limbs on atri-

organ

trialsm and “numbers." I would ratliet spend
time at the PEC, and that's saying something.

2. Have you ever noticed the weird,broken
ﬁle escape hanging off the side of Cainegie?
Why hasn’t that been iemoved? Is it perhaps
because a group ot‘idealisnc
schoolchildren were lured
to their death by a savage
ghoul, and their torrncnteri
souls haunt its tustystcps? I
mean, I'm just saying.

1. The scariest place on
campus, without a doubt,
is the women's bathroom
undei the Forum. I’m 50,,
ry, bur who designed that
placeiMichael Myeis?
Every time i go in rltere,1 make peace with
my lift: ﬁrst. because there's a 90/10 chance I'm
going in die. There's even a weird, shadowy
littlt; cor-net, perfect for sharpening a butcher-
knife! The single-person bathroom may smell

The star/est plate on tampus,
without a doubt, ii the women’s
bathroom under the Forum. l’m
sorry but who designed that
placeierhaelMyersi

like someone's stoiing a rotting steak in thcie,
but at least it doesn't have blood dripping from
the walls.

1 may seem a little overesensirive,hut keep
in mind that I had to take a running leap into
my bed until age 15 to
avoid the person inevitably
hiding underneath. Fooled
you, abnormally skinny se-
rial killet-l Seriously though,
while it's unlikely that any
or us are actually going
to be dismembered by a
clown. it doesn't hurt to be
cautious. Watch out' Are
those footsteps signaling
the approach ofa mentally
disturbed rn‘ get wielding an axe?

Oh, no, it rctually inst a ﬁrst-year srunr-
bling into your remit to urinate in your laundry
hamper. Well, either way, you’re going to have
nightmares for at least a week
