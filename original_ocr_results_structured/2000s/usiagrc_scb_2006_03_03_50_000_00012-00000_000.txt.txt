Tennis picks up three wins over we

at ANDY CHON

The Grinnell mens tennis team is making its presence known
early in the Midwest Conference this season, taking down three
more schools during the second busy weekend this season for the
Pioneers.

The tennis team picked up a win on the road against the Uni-
versity if Wisconsin, Oshkosh, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa on Friday
and another pair ofwins at home the next day against Cornell and
Buena Vista.The three wins give the Pioneers a record ofo-o only
three weeks into their '06 season.

Grinnell had no problem defeating the University ofVVisconsin,
Oshkosh, handily taking all of the singles and doubles matches and
shutting down the Titans, 7-0. Nate Fox ’09 had a great game, tak-
ing down his opponent in straight sets, so and sea. Fellow first
year, Dan LaFountaine also gave a strong performance, defeating
the Titan’s number one, 6—1,6-0.

The Pioneers did not waste any time on Saturday, taking on
Cornell at 9 a.m.on the indoor tennis courts in the PEC. Rick Fen-
bert '06, LaFountaine and Fox all took down their singles opponents
in straight sets.

In the doubles competition, Eric Ohm ’07 and Jordan Lee '08
swept their opponents seo, closing their match without dropping a
single game. LaFotIntaine and Fox left no room for doubt, ﬁnisht
ing their sweep ofCornell by shutting down the Ram’s number one
doubles team 8—0.

Cornell did manage to take a point from Grinnell by defeating
Julian West '06 who forced his match into a third set before falls
ing to Cornell's Tom Jennings, but the match wasn't enough for the
Rams,who fell 671 against the Pioneers.

Grinnell took on Buena Vista University Saturday afternoon,
putting up another perfect 7-0 victory and sweeping the Buena Vis—
ta Beavers into a rapidly growing pile of scoreless opponents.

“Buena Vista hasn’t really had a lot of time to build their pm,
gmm up, so we kind of played out secondary lineup against them,"
said Ohm. “We got the chance to play a few guys that don’t usually
get into the lineup.”

Ohrn defeated his singles opponent without losing a game and
Lee only lost one game before winning his match, 6-1, 6'0. Joe
Jankolovits '07, took down his Buena Vista opponent, 6-1, 6-1 in his
ﬁrst singles match of the ’06 season.

The Pioneers are in good shape for their upcoming match against
Carleton College on March 4 in Bloomington, Minn, which many
Grinnell players view as their first true test ofthe season.

”We played our full lineups against both Cornell and UW Osht
kosh because we wanted our best players to get in as much time and
experience as they could before going into the game against Car-
leton," said Ohrn. "Carleton is our first real challenge ofthe year and
we’re all real excited to have a school coming up that is around the
same level as us, because you only get better playing against quality
opponents."

Men’s basketball falls in MWC semifinals

BY KEVIN BVRNE

It was Pioneer against Pioneer last
weekend in Appleton Wis, as Glinnell
College went up against Carroll Col—
lege in the semiﬁnal round of the Mid
west Conference Tournament.

Unfortunately for the men's basket-
ball team,carroll college and Grinnell
College share more than double 1’s and
a mascot. The Carroll Pioneers are also
very comfortable with a fastepaced,
highescoring game, which has made
them a consistently challenging opptr
nent for Grinnell.

Last Friday
proved to be no ere
ception to the mic.
The Grinnell Pro-
neers had an amaz-
ing game against
Carroll on Feb.
25 and the system
was in full effect
as the men's baSt
ketball team shot
their way to a toml of 127 points, with
seven players contributing points in the
double digits.

However, Carroll was more than
up to the chtdlenge, ﬁnishing the game
with the highest score a team has put
up against Grinnell this year, sweep-
ing Grinnell for the 06 season Cart
roll moved on to the MWC ﬁnals on
Saturday after a convincing victory over
Gtinncll With a ﬁnal score oflS3-127.

“Carroll was able break our press
rather quickly rind then they were able

last forever”

’7 have never had more fun
Wit/7 a group ofguys and their
friendships and memories wri/

Paul Nordlund ’06

to ﬁnish strong at the offensive end,"
said Toby Carlson ’06. “We were able to
force turnovers early and hold a short
lead, but once they ﬁgured out how to
break the press and we tired a bit, they
were able to take advantage."

The Carroll Pioneers put pressure
on Grinnell early in the game and the
men’s basketball team went into the
locker room at halftime down by 21
points, trying to find a way to claw back
into the game.

“At halftime we knew we were in a
tough position, but
we knew we had the
offensive firepower
to strike quick and
jump back in it,”
said Carlson. “We
were able to score
quite a bit against
their defense, but
it all came down to
not forcing enough
turnOVers in the
backcourt.“

The loss ended the Grinnell Pio—
neers' ’057’06 season with a record of
1479 and without the MWC title.
However, despite coming home without
the MWC championship, the Glinnell
Pioneers did not end the season empty
handed,

The Grinnell offense ﬁnished with
the nation’s highest points per game
average and firsteyenre John Grotbeig
and Davie Arsencdult were both voted
to the All-Midwest Conference men's

basketball team this past Monday.

Grotberg was voted AlltMWC
Second Team and Davie Arseneault
was nominated as an Honorable Men’
tion All-MWC pick.

Grotberg led the MWC in points
per game (31.4) and Davie Arseneaulr
led the nation in assists per game (85).
Grotberg’s 31.4 points per game was
also good enough to be the second
highest scorer in the nation

The '05~'06 season was a clear
step forward from last year, with good
memories for the seniors and a solid
foundation for next year's squad.

“1 have no regrets on the year ext
cept for the fact that we lost our most
valuable player, Paul Nordlund, half
way through," said senior Jack Ken-
nedy. “The fact that he couldn’t be on
the ﬂoor with us is still hard to accept.
1 have never had more hm with a group
ofguys and their friendships and mem-
ories will last forever."

Next year’s team will return sortie
valuable conference leaders and the core
of what should be an exciting team to
watch. Offrseason training and a good
recruiting class will also be invaluable
the team.

“We will need 'a good sized recruit-
ing class to continue our playoffrrend,"
said Head Coach Dave Arseneault.
“We could Ilse a rcbounder or two but
mostly we just need numbers so none
of our returning players feel compelled
to play more minutes than_they can
handle."
