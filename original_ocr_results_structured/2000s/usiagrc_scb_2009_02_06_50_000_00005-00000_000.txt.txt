FAC nUde for Media Awareness Week

BV SARAH BLACK

On Thursday night over so students attended a clothes-
optional photo shoot commemorating the 40th anniversary or
Grinnell students challenging a representative from Playboy
magazine with one of the nation’s ﬁrst “Nudeslns.”

The shoot, a preview for the Feminist Action Coalition's
(PAC) ﬁrst Media Awareness Week spanning Feb 9 through
12, was intended to celebrate body diversity and confront
beauty standards in the spirit of the 1969
protest Media Awareness Week. which cos
incidcs with February's designarion as Eat-
ing Disorder Awareness Month, will feature
cvenrs on a range oftopics includrng media
inﬂuence on eating disorders and portrayal
of gender roles and relationships.

Attending students, invited to “come as
naked as they want" according to CoordlnﬂT
tor Emma O’Polka ’12, were photographed
behind a divider by FAC members Emma
Lawler ’09 and Kate Baumgartner '11. "We
don't want to do a naked protcst aminst Playboy, but we do
feel like what they had to say about it is important and relates
to Media Awareness Week because we believe that people that
do have bodies that don’t meet today's standards of a beauti-
ful body should be able to show them and Celebrate them,"
O’Polka said. ‘

The original 1969 Nudesln occurred during a presentation
from a speaker from Playboy magazine sent. along with a carns
pus recruiter, to participate in a Grinncll symposium on inter-s
personal relationships Tcn Grinncll students, horh male and
rcmale, rose from thcir scars, undressed, sang a song in protest
proppressrve media standards of beauty, then distributed ﬂiels

”We believe lhalpeop/e who do
have bodies [bill don’t/nest [o-
day’s standards ofd beautifu/ body
should be able to show lbem”

Emma O’Polka ’12

accusing Playboy otdegrading women and explaining that their
actions were intended to demonstrate the beauty ofrcal bodies.

“I hope it gets to be a part of Love Your Body Week," said
attendee Kelsey Morse—Brown ’09. “I think that would be really
exciting as a way to help people get in touch with and maybe see
their body as beautiful through more artistic nude images."

Participants chose to have all or parts ortherr bodies photos
graphed and copies ornonsrdentityrng photos will be made into
posters advertising Media Awareness week
with the subjects'consent FAC also plans to
create a display in the JRC rcanrring images
from magazine and intcrnet sources that
O'Polka said “will be replaced by images or
real bodies ofreal Griltncll students to show
the diversity and beauty of bodies” over the
course of the week.

FAC member Katie Jones '10 said that
Thursday's shoot “is not antrpomogmphy.
It‘s in a similar spirit as the Nudesln,but not
a protest ofany specific organization."

O‘Polka said that the 1969 protest “received a lot ofnational
media attention. so Gtinnell ms a trendsetter there. FAC really
wants to commemorate this particular incrdcnt ofactivism, be-
cause it’s a major part of Grinnell's history oractivism."

Attendees, such as Morse-Brown, said that the history or
the shoot was less impottattt than its contemporary social ramis
ﬁcations. “1 rlrink [the history’s] less important to me because
l don’t entirely agree with what it is commemorating, but I
deﬁnitely think that this method of talking about body and the
media rs inrportant,"MorscsBrown said.“l agree with the spirit
orthe protest a lot, but that's less nnporranr to me rhan dealing
with things that are going on now."

Boswell heads ag subcommitte, local iarmers unaffected

BVJEFF thocnstrtowc

Lasr month, Leonard Boswell, House Democrat represent—
ing Grinncll and lowa’s 3rd congressional district, was appoints
ed to Chair ofthe Agriculture Subcommittee on General Farm
Commodities and Risk Management for the 111th Congress

As chair, Boswell, who has been serving in the house since
1997, wrll oversee pricing for crop commodities like corn and
soybeans. Commodity pricings are maintained by the govern-
ment through payments to farmers in the tom of subsidies.
The subcommittee also regulates crop insurance, which helps
protect farmers against sub-average harvests.

Boswell’s new position gives Iowa—and the Corn Belt7
more political sway

“I think any appointment of this nature of our reptcsentm
tives iit government should be a good thing for our state,"loWa
General Assembly Representative Betty De Boef wrote in an

email.

Susan McAvoy. Chief of Staff for Boswell, said that he is
very pleased and honored to serve as chair or the sub-commit~
tec,onc orrhe largest under the House Committee on Agriculs
nrrc. McAvoy said Boswell will keep farmers and consumers
best interests in mind through these economically hard times,

“His goal is to make sure producers and farmers can manage
this [economic crisis] and food prices cart stay where they are in
the supermarket," McAvoy said,

Local support for the appointment, however, has not been
as enthusiastic. Several local farmers said they were not cons
ccrncd with Boswell's new position, as they did not grow crops
regulated by the sub-committee.

Barney Bahrenfusc, or’ 8&3 Farms, said he did not follow
commodity pricing because he sells only meat and poultry Cine
ger Werner, a farmer in Chelsea, grows a variety of products.

‘ikc vegetables, {nut and herbs. unrelated to commodity prices.

Steven Paul, orPrtul’s Grains, docs sell corn, wheat and soy-
reans, some or the crops rcgulatcd by the subcommittee, bur
he said he does not support the committee's actions because it
creates too much government intervention.

“I'm for a free marker price, not bigger government." Paul
said. “That's whar made our country strong, our constitution
provided for a tree market, not socialism."

one oftllc major critiques ofthe crop payments regulated
by Boswell's subcommittee is that most go to larger agribusi-
nesses and local farmers do not see many ofthe beneﬁts.

Boswell also serves on the Agricultural subcommittee on
Livestock, Dairy and Poultry, which he chaired last session, as
well as several subcommirtces in the Committee on Transpor—
tation and lnrrasrrucrurc.
