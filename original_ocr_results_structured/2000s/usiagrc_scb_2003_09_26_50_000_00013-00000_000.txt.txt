Cavemen vs. slow connection

A lor of people have been complaining about rhe

invited! If you have
a random rant, email
it to me at

After all, complain-
ing in a public forum
is always more fun
than doing it alone.

for a few minutes. you siart to worry and wonder iryour
friends are doing okay 1would like to ask everyone to step
back a moment, take a deep breath, and think about how
it was in rhe mveman days. The dinosaurs had no internal
connection; Lhey had to use eoeonurs eenneetod wiihvinos

could train squirrels to errry bits or paper aeross mmpus.
