Two towering
feature films

Bradley & Jeremy debate the brilliance of The Two Towers, and
praise Far From Heaven. As always, the Forum movie is ignored.

Bradley: Adaptation didn’t make ir ro Grinncll lasr
week. I'm sorry rhar some oryou had ro endure Mnr‘dirr

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers
(PG-13)

Here's rhe Pitch' Here's another three hour movie
about hobbits!

B: The seeond highesr grossing ﬁlm oi lmr year (ro
SpldneM/ln). which everyone doubrlessly has seen, is
upon us. The second parr otherer Jackson’s epieTollu‘en
Middle Earth rrilogy pielss up where The Fri/brainy: af
vie Ring abruprly ended: rwo hobbirs. Ftodo (Elijiah)
and Sarmvise (Sean Asrin), are nudging towards Mount
Doom ro desiroy the rirular ring svhile rwo othels, Merry
and Pippin. are being rescued by Atagom (Viggcr
Mortcmen), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), and Legolas (the
arrmrrive Orlando Bloom), rhe orher surviving mem-
bers of the fellowship. The two towers our heroes are
indirectly battling arc- in lsenprd, helmed by the villain-
ous saruman, and Mordor, eonrrolled by the speerer or
ssuron, rhe ereasor oirhe ring, Lspeer a good deal oiore
deaihs._

Jeremy: Three hours orvrsual speeiaele, amazingspb
cial effects, ore-killing excitement. and exposition that
builds and builds and builds and then tells you to come
back nextyear for the climax and resolution. Three hours
of what would generally be die boring middle ofdac movie
where you gor up so go ro rhe badnoom. The Tum 721mm
plays ar one level, dict: um are dynamic conrrasrin mood
and rone rhar made TbeFrllau/slrip afrlraRr'ngbrile

BUT, this is a ﬁlm that suffers out
ofnecessity. The two ﬁlms surrounde

eepr all rhree are segmenn ofthc same
ﬁlm. The Two 777mm is Lbeweak link,
bur when pur in context srands up rce
niarkably well

B: I disagree svirh you, Jeremy.

ro the ﬁnal pair ofthe rrilogy, but rhey are more
