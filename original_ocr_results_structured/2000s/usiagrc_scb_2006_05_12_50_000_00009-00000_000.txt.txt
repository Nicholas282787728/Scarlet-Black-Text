Student Affairs increased funding and training for mental health, but some problems remain

BY LOLA GARCIA

The summer after the spring 2003 suicides,
President Russell K. Os ood sent letters to par-
ents of all enrolled studgents announcing that a
Mental Health Task Force would meet to create a
list of recommendations to address mental health
and suicide prevention on campus.

As of last semester, with the addition of one
buffer day between the end of classes and the
exam period, nearly all of those recommendations
had been instituted accordin to
Vice President for Student airs
Tom Crady.

spring of €03 was so the earli-

Stu ems who have used the mental health
center have found it useful. “I was feeling really
stressed out about school and my boyfriend," said
one junior, who asked to remain anonymous to
protect her privacy

The student said she had used the walkrin cenr
ter about ﬁve times in the last year, and althou h
she was always able to see a counselor that ay,
she said, wait time could be a roblem.

“There was only one time had to wait less
than an lions," she said, “and it was when I was
havin an anxiety attack and was counted as
a stu ent in crisis.” She said that according to
the staff, she would only have to wait “15 or 20
minutes."

Still, the walk-in counseling center is a major
change for students. Andrew Wislocki ’03 rcr

”Itjust seems like much more than we had at?

to mental health was much more limited when
you had to leave campus."

As a whole, funding for mental health services
has continued to increase since 2003.

For the 2003-2004 school year $162,000 were
committed to maintaining walk-in counseling,
training faculty and staff and providing emer-

cncy psychiatric services. Now
t ose same services have an an-
nual budget of $234,000.

This budget covers training

He said that he wanted to remain vi ilant to
issues of mental health on campus. “ e most
important thing is not to be—

“We need to really be sure
that services evolve as students
evolve.”

For some students who were
not here during the suicides,
the cam us does not feel like
a relaxe environment. “'l'here

She sai that before comin
to Grinncll she had heard that there was a hig
suicide rate, and while she found that her initial
assumptions were exaggerated, she said that she
did not think that Grinnell has a good mental
health environment. “Sometimes when I read
Plans, especially the ‘Secrets’ section, I get really
worried.

Crady said that despite all the efforts that
Student Affairs and the administration has made,
they could not provide a perfect solution.

‘Wc realize that you could do everything in
the world and still have a suicide " he said.

For members ofthc Student Afairs staff, the
suicides of three years a 0 still inﬂuence how they

“When I hear sirens,l think about three years
