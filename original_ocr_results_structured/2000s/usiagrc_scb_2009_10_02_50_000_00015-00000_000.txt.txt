With two harsh home-ﬁeld losses to Macal-
ester College and the University of Wisconsin
Platteville this past wedtend, the Gnnnell Men’s
Soccer Team (475) is learning from their nus
takes, crying out a new system and getting ready
for another twogame weekend with matches
versus Beloit College at 4:00 pm. Friday in Be
loit, Wis. and a home game against Monmouth
College at 1:30 p.m. Saturday.

Despite a 0-2 loss last Saturday, Gnnnell
played a hardefought gamth Gnnnell Pio»
neers only had one shot less on goal than the
UW-Platteville Pioneers.

‘1 thought we played well both gnmcsi
there were no individual mistakes that hape
pened," Matti Sahel ’11 said. “We wanted it, but
they capitalized on their goals so you can’t really
blame it on anybody~we just didn’t get lucky as
a team."

The Pioneers tried out a new system against
UW-Platteville, a Mes—comprising of three
defenders, four midﬁelders and three forwards.
This system allowed the Pioneers to have an ag-
gressive offense, which they attribute to the of
fense’s continuous improvement.

“In the beginning of the season our defense
was really good and our oriense was struggling
a little bit, but now we’ve got both aspects of
the team playing very well," captain Andrew
Stephenson '10 said “This weekend should
deﬁnitely show us a little about how we'll do in
conference play and we expect nothing less than
two wins."

Last year, the Pioneers posted a 1-1 tile with
Belolt and a 3—0 victory over Monmouth, With
their offense in gear, the Pioneers can look for
ward to a consistenly strong defense, largely at-
tributed to goalkeeper Ben Scliemper '11, to
bring two wins to their 1r0 conference record.

 

“Schempet has been playing phenomenally,"
Stephenson said. “He came into shape this year
for the season and really has been better than he
was in years pistﬂnd he was great even back
then."

“He lets us play rnorc offensively because its
not a spot we have to worry about," Alex Kohut
'10 said.

Schcmper, who had nine saves in the UW7
Platteville grme, is conﬁdent going into the
weekend.

“I’ve been making saves that need to be
made so I think that I’ve helped the team a101,"
Schemper said. "A lot of that comes from the
atmosphere that our team has right now—it’s a
really empowering atmosphere, everybody is re
ally positive."

This positivity was not evident from the
slmtistephenson cited that they came into the
season considering themselves a skilled team, but

CMT DEMOTI' GRADY

After two losses, Men’s Soccer on the offensive

after a few losses, the team united in a new, hard—
working mindset.

1 think we've deﬁnitely come together as a
team, it took a lot of hard, close—fought losses, it
took a lot of running, but we are now working
for each other and that’s something thatl really
minted to see," Stephenson said.

Ultimately, the men’s soccer team hopes their
rekindled hardworking attitude and adjust—
ments from pn'or losses will lead them to Victory
not only this weekend, but through the end of
the season as well.

“Last weekend we were putting sentences
together at times, getting close to paragraphs.
And ifwe can do that this weekend it'll be a step
forward," Schemper said "Then we can move on
to maybe putting everybody on the same page.
Once that takes place it‘s going to be really hard
for people to beat us."

Pioneers shut out Lawrence in first win of this season

Football firing on all cylinders heading into this weekend/s game against Midwest Conference powerhouse Monmouth

BY MOLLY MILLER

The Gnnnell Pioneers Football Team shut out the Lawrence Vi-
kings this past Saturday 4243, the first shut out Lhe program has seen
in its past 11 years. It was also the ﬁrst win ofthe season as the team
currently stands at 1r3.

“This has been a long time coming,"Tearn captain Curtis Mar
Coy’10 said.“'lt's great to make great strides as a program. It’s an ode
to how much this program has come along"

The team accomplished many of their season goals in one game
by shutting and blowing a team out.

‘When we have a great e, it’s because everyone does their
job,” McCoy said. "It’s a team effort. The deﬁning characteristic of
this team is that we don’t have one superstar."

ltwas truly abrmkout day for the teamronensc had many players
step up, going without a single mayor and putting up a total of 410
yards, while defense gave up a record low for the season of186 yards.

Quarterback Mike Bogard '12 commanded the offense, having a
hand in a total of ﬁve touchdowns.

“Bogard had his best game of the year,” Head Coach Max
Hawsey said.

Bogard had three touchdown pages in addition to his two touch»
down runs, throwing a tool ofzoo yards and rushing for 55 yards.

The only stat that seemed to he not in the Pioneers favor was

time of possession. Lawrence held on to the ball for 33:02 to Gtin-
nell's 26:58, but even this held good news.

"It means the offense was crediting," captain Marquis Bradley
’10 said, “They were getting on the ﬁeld, getting the job done and
getting on."

After putting up only one touchdown in the ﬁrst quarter, the team
forged ahead in the second quarter scoring three touchdowns.

"We started having fun,"Bradley said. "In the second quarter, we

shut them down right oﬂ’ the bat, And that's when we thought, rWe _

can play with them} Our offense got rolling, and there was no stop-
ping them."

Special teams also came through with some big plays, protecting
Lawrence’s "0" on the scoreboard. In the fourth quarter, Lawrence
drove to within field goal range, jeopardizing Gnnnells chance to ac-
complish their season goal ofshutting a team away. However, this was
the play in which Mart John'lz earned the special teams player ofthe
week a\vard.]ohn moved in to block the ﬁeld goal, forcing Lawrence
to end their drive empty-handed

"We were all praying for a miracle,"Bradley said. “And Matt John
just came out of nowhere"

In the last halfof the game, the second team was brought in, with
great sumess. Running backTJ. Schaid '13 played notably well, scot—
ing his ﬁrst collegiate touchdown, and hurdling over a defender late

in the fourth.

“[itwas] like something out ofavideo game," Brian Taylor’13 said.

‘we’ve been waiting for him to have a breakout game," l-lawsey
said. "He‘s going to be one of our top skills guys."

(Luarterback Mike McCabe ’13 led the team in rushing with 71
yards while only playing for a quarter and a half.

It's been a rough season so far, but the program has taken ime
mense strides.

"We could have easily been 4—0," Sdiaid said, "The games we’ve
lost were heartbreakers."

Those three losses were only by a total of 17 points, and after last
week's win, Gnnnell have actually outscored their opponents 95 to
70. The team sees the game against Lawrence as tumaround for the
pro .
“All the hard work we’ve put in, coming oifthree hard losseHr
made a smtement in the conference,"Taylor mid.

This coming Saturday Gnnnell will play Monmouth college
in Monmouth, III. at 1:00 pm. While it will be a challenge—Mon-
mouth won the Midwest Conference Championslup last season and
is ranked 11th according to the popular website DJ/borra/ltowlast
week's victory gives the team the conﬁdence to hold their head high.

“Our biggest thing is we're not going to be afraid," Bradley said.
