Seeing past
the rhetoric

I still remember the summer of1999,whcn
newspapers, cable networks and websites in
China ﬁlled their headlines with stories about
the bombing otthe Chinese embassy in Yugor
slavia by the USeled NATO forces and images
of frenzied students protesting the atrocities of
“American Imperialists.”Six months later came
the case of Dr, Lee Wen H0, at Taiwanrborn
Chinese American wrongfully accused ofspy-
ing for Beijing. When 1 had a chance to revisit
Dr. Lee’s story,I was struck by the tribulations
that still traumatize many newcomers who
embark on their journey to the New World
with unwithered Amer- ican dreams.

Yet he
neath the
turbulence of
ethnic pol}
tics, a greater
problem is

that, as long
as the t w o

 

countries, China (Mainland) the United
states, cannot comfortably trust each other,
mistrust toward the frrscgeneration Chinese
Americans, especially those who work with
politically sensitive, stttte-of-arts technolo
gies like Dr. Lee, will persist in cvcry corner
of the social and political paradigm. Similarly,
the several E’COll’COnlﬂinln‘dth food recalls
this ycar by American companies from do-
mestic markets certainly cannot compete with'
the similar incidents on Chinese cakfoods in
terms ofpublicity and degree of politicization,
Most media news sources will keep on telling
the fairy tale that, when there is no more im~
port from China (tomorrow, maybe Vietnam
and Thailand as well), the prince and the prin-
cess can live happily ever after.

At the Democratic debate in Chicago, cane
didates refused to clarify whether China is a
friend or adversary but agreed to call China a
"strategic competitor.” It is not entirely obvi-
ous what the euphemism is alluding to, yet one
thing is clear: as China exuberantly marches
towards industrialization and modernization,
fear toward this export juggernaut will not
evaporate any time soon. But pointing ﬁngers
at China does not teach one how to make
structural adjustments or how to take care
orthc poor in an age of globalized economy

without shutting down trade: China is also

bogged in its own incomergap problems,
American people and their leaders must call
on their own wisdom to sort out the mess
in domestic distributive justice. But, so far,
aside from typical fanfares condemning the
evil of corporate America,ch politicians
have elucidated the practical economics of
trade and taught hardworking Americans
how to take advantage of globalization in-
stead of being taken advantage of,

In fact, a more rational voice on trade
will {it comfortably into Democrats agenda
along with other proposals on healthcare,
education and green energy. A successful
healthcare reform that enables American
workers to switch jobs easily without los-
ing healthcarc coverage will greatly reduce
anxiety in the midst ofa structural adjust
ment. By improving the education system,
America will have an oven more competitive

workforce that can quickly adapt to the de
mands otthc lllnrkct By developing tcncwablc
or alternative energies, Atnctica will not only
bc able to reduce its reliance on Nlldi‘llC’Ean’
cm oil, but also foster a whole new industry
that creates jobs, exports and revenue, lVlcrm-
while, ratsrng import standards and the level of
inspection for imporrcd goods would not only
ensure that American consumers, cspccially
lowcrrincomc iamilics, obtain cheap and sate
commodities, but also push producers abroad
to adopt bcttcr practices in manufacturing,
This list goes on and on, but no one in this
campaign has even started telling the other
side of the story,

Therefore, Dr. Lee Won Ho's story is still
not the most inconvenient truth for the xe-
nophobes, The more troubling truth is that,
as the wind orpopulism blows, many citizens
are too easily driven by the campaign rhctoric
while shying away from trying to think in a
rational my

Edwards will
change DC.

I would like to tell you that I know who
our next president will be, or even what party
they will be a member of, but I cannot. Noth-
ing is guaranteed. something I can tell you
however is that our next president will be left
with an enormous mess, and it won't be easy to
clean up. Getting us out oflraq is just the be—
ginning. Our government has been hijacked by
big corporations and their
armies oflobbyists, Ifwe
want to provide the fun-
damental human right
of health care to the 47
million Americans who
arc currently uninsured
we need a president that
will stand up and ﬁght
these insurance and drug companies and their
lobbyists that derailed universal health care
reform in 1993794. lrwe want to stop global
warming we need tt president who will stand

Democrats.

It’s not enough to rep/ate a
bunt/l oftorporale Republicans
Willi a bunch oftorpomre

up to these oil and coal companies and their
lobbyists. lfxve want to stop exporting Amcrir
can jobs to countries that have children work-
ing 14 hours a day for less than 7% of what a
comparable job in thc us, would pay we need
a president who will oppose trndc deals, like
the recent one Obama and Clinton voted for,
that are pushed by the lobbyists of big corpor
rations that want to increase their profits by
dodging U.S. cnvitonmcntal and labor laws.

It’s not enough to replace a bunch of corn
porate Republicans with a bunch of corporate
Democrats. We need to nominate someone
that has a history of fighting and winning
tough election battles and ﬁghting and Wine
ning.That’s why I'm going to caucus for John
Edwards on Januarys, John was the ﬁrst mem-
ber of his family to go to college and when he
got there he fought his way to the top of his
class. After graduating from law school,]ohn
became a lawyer and fought for individuals
against corporations, Often these individuals
were injured by products that the corporations
know were dangerous but continued to sell to
maintain their proﬁtsjohn relentlessly fought
against those corporations and beat them again
and again. John then entered the political
scene and ran against Republican incumbent
Lauch Faircloth for one of North Carolina’s
us. Senate seats Although a clear underdog,
John fought hard and defeated the sitting Re-
publican senator. In his Senate campaign, dur-
ing his ﬁrst presidential bid, and now John has
never accepted contributions from Washing»
ton lobbyists. He is the only candidate in this
race that can say that.

As a child,ln the court room, in his Senate
campaign in North Carolina,
and in his unwavering stance
against taking contributions
from Washington lobbyists
John Edwards has a clear and
lmpresswe record of ﬁghting
tough battles and winning. In
such a crucial election, with so
much at stake for us and the
rest orthe world, that type ofrecord is exactly
what we nCCdr Let’s take our country back.
