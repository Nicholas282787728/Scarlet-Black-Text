the Beatles topped the album charts. contemporaries

estimated that no pertentofall singles sold in the firstthtee

months of 1954 were beetles records. These were the top

songs, in descending order: "Can't Buy Me Love," ”TM“ and

Shout," "She Loves You," ”I Want to hold Vour Hand” and
“Please Please Me.”

With the January indictment of Jnseph Massino, all ﬁve of
New Vork City’s Mafia bosses are, for the first timey
simultaneously behind bars. (Massino was indicted on charges
related to a murder that occurred after Psi agent ”Donnie

United Nations membership swelled at the end of the Cold
War, as newly-organized countries were recognized and
accepted by the body: 25 new nations joined between 1990
and 1994, for a total of 135 when we were in middle school.
Since 1999, however, the number has risen again (to 191) as
a few existing countries have opted to join. The hodys newest
member is Switzerland, whose voters approved a referendum
on the issue in March 2002.

Though by some accounts Switzerland is the world's oldest
democracy—citizens have voted at town meetings since at
least the 13th centuryeSwiss women could not vote in
national elections until 1971. Some parts ofthe country still
prohihit female suffrage in regional elections,

starting with New Zealand in 1893, almost every country in
the world has granted votes to women, usually after protracted
political struggle. in many countries, especially in latin
America, it was left-leaning politicians who worked hardest
to withhold female suffrage: on a global scale, women tend
to Vote for politically conservative candidates.

Afgentinlan populist Juan Peron oversaw the introduction of
women's suffrage to his countryatthe urging of his wife and
political ally Eva Peron, “Evita,” who considered running tor

HE FELT MUCH BETTER
NOW THAT HE UNDERSTOOD.

A senior’s dying words

My time is coming soon. in a matter ofwceks, i will leave
this world for a different, Real one. I can already feel my strength
leaving me, Looking back on my college experience, I can say
that much more than regretting things that I've done, l regret
not doing some things that I could have done. It is useless to
dwell on the many missed opportunities, as it‘s much too late for
me to do them now, and impossible for me to turn back time
pick a different path. But i can tell you about my faded dreams
and missed chances, with the hope that you may pursue
them yourselves.

Get a Davis Buddy. in this cruel and unfair world,
its refreshing to spend a few days a week with an en

thusiastic and naive eighteyearrold, probably cheating

at Go Fish and picking the wings offofflies. Davis

buddies are just as much fun (and just as

mature) as your college friends, except that ,

you don't even have to get them drunk for

them to act silly and crazy. Plus. they think

that you are really awesome, because you’re older and have prob.
ably kissed girls, Buddies are a constant reminder ofwhat’s really
important in this world, like laughing, riding bikes, eating sun-
daes. and not have children ofmy own, ever.

Play an intramural sport. When I think about an activity
that is fun and involves excrcixc, I think oftunniiig from a mute
detoiis grizzly bear. Then I remember that's not fun. But intta.
mural sports come close to ﬁlling both requirements, Winning

isn't important, and neither is looking good. Not to mention that
you have the chance to throw your elbows up in the face ofthat
kid in your Soc class who talks when he hasn't done the reading.

Hang out offcairipiis. Although 1 sometimes visit the offcain.
pus houses and apartments of other Grinnell students. and al.
though 1 sometimesshop oreatdowntown, 1 rarely got the chance
to really explore the town or the parks or the people. Sure, the
Pub bouncer knows my birthday, and sure, the high school kids
have somehow found out that I’m a fuckin' hippie dyke, but other

than that I don't feel that 1 ever connected with Grinncll oute

side of the college.

Drop a class. ifby the middle ofthe semester you really
don't like one of your classes, don’t be afraid to drop it, it
doesn't matter ifit's the subject matter you don’t like, oi the

teaching style or the other kids in the class, don’t think

that you're a failure for getting out ofa

bad learning situation. Don’t think of

dropping a class as failing, think ofit

as not being good enough to succeed.

Don’t let Grinnell get you down.

Like many kids in at Grinntll, I’ve spent a little too much time

letting Grinnell get me down. sure, things will be frustrating and

angering and hard to deal with, but it won't be anywhere near as

frustrating and angering as i hear the Real world is. You might

not notice it now, but you really are learning and growing a lot

during your timeherc. Soon you'll have hair in places where there
wasn’t hair before,

 

Hello.

The other day I was reading the paper online and couldn't
help but notice how similar the images from the ‘die in’ outside
the bookstore were to footage of the Kurds after they had been
gassed by Hussein. So. since the paper seems contained about the
war, 1 figure I’d send in some suggestions on how to make peace
protests more effective. These suggestions were intended for some
one I know (and aie taken from a letter), but l imagine that they're
fairly universal:

1)Thc pointahoutnotbotheringto dialogue wnli your lessets,
or people who don't use the same words as you . . .well, there you
have the mayority of the problem. The only people who you are
willing to dialogue with are people who share your opinion.

2) Us primitive Americans really hate people who brag about
their degrees and academic credentials, This isn't just because iis
plebes are just as smart as you but didn’t go as far due to econom.
ics . , . it's because the academic community only produces worth.
less —stuff.- You‘re bragging about being smart, yet your brilliance
can be pulled apart by a fiveeyeateold. For example, ‘A certain
persons pronouncement on PLANS“ thatAmerica todayisworse
than imperial japan in WWII . . . Really, extraordinarily stupid
*stuff- like that just makes us uneducated types, who may have
had relatives in Japanese POW camps, laugh at you guys.

3) Fashion . . . a large portion ofthe peace *cause' just comes
off as fashion.

4) Adult ‘studcnt aciivixm' . . . when Peter Jennings gives a
sympathetic interview with two-college activist leaders, and they

turn out to have already graduated, activism looks llke a yoke.
The average person. who has a iob they hate, iust sees rich -fel.
Iows‘ whose parents suppoit them. Activism doesn’t pay for it.
self. right?

5) in regards to 4), no one takes protests that occur between 9
am. and s p m. seriously. for reasons you might not get.

of Your protests look more like parties than protests. Bud-
dhist monks setting themselves on fire is a protest . , , Some
college kids singing along with a rock band at a ‘protest' is a con.
cert.

7) Walking out on classes. . . walk out on work. That would
be respected,

s) Laughing at people's fears, especially after 9.11, just seems
naive, cruel, or arrogant.

9) Calling people who disagicc with you your future gardener
..,iust emphasizes l to 8.

10) Making fun ofPOW: who have just watched their come
rades get executed , , , not acceptable outside of the Al iaieera
viewership, Again, look backar ] to a, sorry those enlistees didn't
have rich folk as their parents,

11) Buying anything the lraqi government tells you. . , when
you accept wreckage from a cardboard ‘cruisc missile' with 1945
U5. markings on it as evidence ofan atrocity. . . you look gull.
ible. Yes, America has, too, but at least out has aren’t apparent to
anyone who knows the difference between aluminum and card
board.

12) When you call people ‘nurs' or stupid for pointing out
that islamic Fundamentalists want to destroy the {1.5. . . . well,
you just look like you believe in politicallycorrect ideology more
than you trust your own eyes. sorry to sound so bitter.
