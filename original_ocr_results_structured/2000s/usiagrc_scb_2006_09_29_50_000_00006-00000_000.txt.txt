Putting on a play is a lot ofwork. Organizing and directing
a completely student-run production that involves ZO stolics
written by third and fourth graders well, let's just say Sally
Webster '07 and Christian Ricci ’08 have a lot on their hands
this week,

Webster and Ricci are firstszime directors ofThc chcrland
Players, an independent production group founded two years
ago by Kar Henry ’06. The Neverland Players compile their
production from stories written lav local elementary school stu—
clents.They will pciform this Fri y and Saturday at 7:00 pm.
and Sunday at 2:00 pm, at the Wall in Bucksbaum.

The Players solicit stories from classes at Davis Elementary.
“We get maybe 50, 60 stories," said Webster. They draw_ from
this large pool ofideas to create the 15 to 20 skits that compose
the performance. “The Neverland Players serves the purpose of
a connection between the community, the Davis Elementary
School and the college," said Rieci.

The snidentsrtm nature of the production presents some
difficulties for the directors and actors. “The challenges are
Coming up right abour now," said Ricci. “The problem is ger-
ting tickets, posters, programs And so I’d say that‘s the hard-
est part.”

Another challenge will come next year with the loss of mus
sic directorBen Kim '07. Kim's piano accompaniment has been
a part ofthe Neverland Players since its founding. “When the

_ actors start workshoppi nd rehearsing, i go in and I just
wareh rhem," Kim says. “I imagine what kind of background
music and sound etrects would be appropriate, and then 1 just
put them in."

Because Kim's musical score is such an integral part of the
production. both Ricci and Webster expressed concern regard
ing his departure at the end at this year, “Ben Kim has been
doing rhe music from rhe very beginning," Webster said “i’m
hoping, because he graduates this year, that he can train
somebody who eonld possibly replace him, which 1 doubt."

Despite these challenges, the Neverland Players aren't likely
to go away any time soon, In the years since its founding, the

Players has established itseltas a popular campus ﬁxture and a
creative alternative to formal theater productions. “Kat Henry
originated this sort of far less, nonacademic type of theatre,
where there aren't huge study books, study guides for each play,
and it doesn’t require dramaturgieal research,”said Riccr. “It's a
lot more of a liglitshearted, imaginative type of theatre."

The Neverland Players relies heavily on collaboration be
tween directors rind cast members. “It focuses a lot on the ac»
tors‘ creativity, and the actors’ working together, because they
are the ones who come up with the ideas {oi the stories,for the
sketches that we have," Webster said “We’re not imposing a
certain directorial Concepts"
