SGA Fall: Two VPs, two checks

in a recent nationally
televised address President
Bush announced his decision
to dispatch over 20,000

more troops

continuing the war.

“I think that, despite all
the rhetoric, [the American
presence] is basically an im-
perial occupation I don't
think the competing plans
by either the Democrats or
the Republicans are going
to change that. i feel like
wharcver‘s going to happen
is going to be in the inter
est of the U.S. government,
and not the Iraqis ...I would
advocate whatever the Iraqis
want."

to Iraq in order to shore up security and iestore order in the
increasingly chaotic country. Dubbed the “surge" plan by
conservatives and called an “escalation"by liberals, itwould
increase Army personnel primarily in and around Baghdad,
hopefully providing the needed security to begin recone
struttion of the country and transfer power to Iraqi leadeis.
Senate Democrats, continuing their oppostitioii to the
President, have introduced a nonsbinding resolution that
would exprcss disapproval of the “surge" plan. There are,
however, less symbolic measures floating through Congress
such as denying the president the frrnding necessary for

Chris Hall iuid Michael Billups, SGA piesident and vices
president, came rnto office with an agenda ofSGA reform _ d
student financial issues. But ru rmplcmcutrug their plans, they
also had to tackle a procedural roadblockitheir own hick of
time to rncct and interact with their peers,

On \Vednesday, SGA will hold it campus~wide referendum
on ‘ti bill to allow for two vice-presidents in the SGA Cabinet.
This amendment passed Joint Board last semester and marks a
major procedural shirt aimed at giving the SGA president more
time to spcud with students,

The nine SGA Cabinet members often run from one meet-
ing to the next, splitting their time betweeanint Board meets
ings, Cabinet meetings, and various committee meetings.

Hall and Billups also have birweelely meetings with Presir
dent Osgood and Jen Krohn, dean of student life. These coin-
mitments, which help run SGA, can take time away from meet-
ing with students—which Billups and Hall agree is essential
for bridging the gap between students and the administration,
faculty, and trustees. “We are a thermometer,“ said Billups. “We
take the temperature ofcampus."

Currently. the president oversees student life and the vice
president, academic affairs. if a new vice president is added,
she would share what Billups called the administrative responr
sibilities or the position. Right now, “the SGA president and
vice president are on two parallel tracks," Billups said. “Having
a second VP will let the President be in chaige of an umbrella
organization and free up him or her to spend more time with
students."

Anowing the SGA President to spend less time in meetings
and more time with students would, according to the adminis-
tmtion, be an important step towards reform and strengthens
ing SGA-student relations. Max Crowder ’09 said he hoped
SGA would act as an “Accurate representation ofwhat the stu—
dent body wants and needs."This representation can only exist
through active discussion between students and SGA, he said.

Assault

from p- 1 tr ing it, Martyn did not hear again from
the police department.

“From the sounds ofit, they weren't going to make it a tore
mal case or anything," he said. “Maybe just talk to the kid’s
parents." Martyn is skeptical that security can have an effect on
these types of incidents. “Unless there’s a gate preventing cars
from coming on campus there’s nothing you can do,” he said.

But the police department will continue to search for cars
matching the description. “We want to try to get the word
out," said Sittig. Sittig hopes to find some ofthe students who
were leaving the campus center when the incident occurred.
He hopes to find someone who saw the plates or model of the

Th move for another position reflects the current admin»
istrarion's attempts to respond to student concerns, such as the
controversial tuition hikes To address this ssuc, SGA created
a booklet titled “Tuition Stories," distributed to trustees over
winter bleak, The booklet e itiiins 25 student testimonials
written about how tuition increases will affect thcii lives. SGA
created the publication so that student voices could be heard
before board members participate in the final vote on tuition
that Will occur in two weeks.

SGA has also been sensitive to srudenrs’ financial needs in
other ways, for instance in their modiﬁcation of student pay-
check distribution, Next year, student workers will be paid twice
a month instead ofthe current once-a-month checks.

“The Assistant Treasurer, Brad Bishop, put in a great
amount of work to get this done," said Hall. More frequent
paychecks will help students who have bills due in the middle
ottbe month. SGA is also reportedly working on pay raises for
student workers.

SGA also worked to help student organizations secure ads
cqunte funding. SGA temporarily fixed the problem in come
muuity service project funding when it earmarked 310,000 of
its own budget for the ReNew Orleans after the community
Service Center was unable to provide the necessary funds. SGA
administrators do not know whether itwrll be able to continue
allotting so much to community service nextyear and has yet to
frnd a permanent solution,

But some student concerns have not seen similar progress.
Despite student suppott, a dark room wasn’t a priority for the
administration because EXCO, Grinncll's experimental college,
provided a course on digital photography This issue, although
important to last year's SGA President John Bohman ‘06, has
been put on the back—burner this year.

Other Grrnneliinns would like to see more progress made
on implementing the student initiatives that were passed last
semester. “I would like to see something come out of the stu—
dent initiatives, not just words," said Ashley Baccam '10.

Yearbook

WM ‘7. , eeived complaints from people who had

already paid for the book through Jen
Krohn, Dean for Strident Life.

Omwcga said he did not wanr SPARC to be “meddling
[with] the affairs of the publications. We’re supposed to play
a guiding role."

Petrie will be the sole editor of the 2006-2007 yearbook
and believes that he will encounter fewer problems with the
new printer, Acme Printing, which also publishes the crime/i
Rcoirro and is based in Des Moines. A previous yearbook edi~
tor had agreed to a three-year contract with Walsworth that
expired this year.

omwega also said that with the new publisher there is a
“great chance" that the yearbook will come out earlier next year.
