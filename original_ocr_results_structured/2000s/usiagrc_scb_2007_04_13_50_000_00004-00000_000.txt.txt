SMITH '05

On the first Saturday of Spring Break, Grandpa Lloyd
drove up to my apartment at 7:50 a.m. to tell me I was al-
ready missing the potato peeling. He anxiously rushed me to
the car. Today was one of Reinbeck, Iowa's most important

social gatherings: the Isaac Wa

lton League’s annual "Game

Feed." By six p.m. people had converged from all sides of
Grundy County for what one awed attendee called "the big—
gest pile of meat I’ve ever seen.”

Grandpa and Uncle Jerry were both
League Chapter Presidents and Grandpa {cit
pressure to be at all stages of “feed preparar
tion," so we drove north on a nearly empty
Highway 63. in Toma, Grandpa poinred out
a public sculpture by my great-aunt Duffy.
Grandpa doesn't ralk about my mother's side
of the family since the divorce brit everyone
likes to talk about Duffy. She recently retired
as sculptor of the annual butter cow in the
Iowa State Fair.

Many other people have treated butter
cows for many other state fairs, but Duffy has
stretched the medium to its limits, are ng
birtter horses butter pigs,
butter goats, a butter Elvis
and an original lifersize
interpretation of the Last
Supper in butter.

Past Tama, Grandpa
explained the story of the
Abraham Lincoln histotir
cal site. He tells the story
every time we drive between Grinnell and
Reinbeck. Prior to his presidency, Lincoln did
something that the governor of Iowa viewed
as beneﬁcial re the state. Grandpa doesn't re-
call what this service was. but Lincoln received
a tract ofland from the governor orowa.The
future president never visited the land and al-
lowed it to lapse back into state control to
avoid paying property taxes on it. There is a
small memorial on the land and several high
way signs tell you how to get there.

After Grandpa ﬁnished his memorial star
ry,l told him I’m applying for a job in scot-
land and he launched into an excited rccole
lection of our family's SCOiClPIl’iSh heritage.
My greatrgreatrgrandfather, an immigrant
blacksmith, ms the leader responsible for
bringing over most of the Scots who settled in
mostly German Reinbeck. People used to call
him “Bull.” My grandfather claimed “numers

“Brill was the strongest man in all of Grundy
County.”

Reinbeck lies 45 minutes north ofGrinnell
and, in comparison, Grinncll is a sprawling
metropolis. We parked under the old sign for
Your Place or Mine, Reinbeck's only restaurant,
a small town family diner confusingly named
like a gay singles bar. lts next door neighbor is
the Congregational Church and it sits across
from the American Legion. The name doesn't
seem to bother them. Or at least no one's ever
brought it up.

The Isaac Walton Leagueis (they call
themselves the lkes) rent-
cd out rhc Legion Hall for
the feed. My father and
uncle were in the kitchen
when we arrived, but be-
fore I could
say hello, I was
conscriprcd \0
pick up sups
plies with Tim Middleburger and
Jim Pairot.Thc lkes are an environ-
mental group distinguishable from
Grinnell's environmental clubs by
their love oftrucks.

As middleragcd guys in baseball hats
go, Tim and Jim pretty much ﬁt the mold.
erilc we picked up various boxcs,I asked what
the case ofBaretta Gun Lubricant was fotrTim
said,“That’s a prize for tonight’s raffle."On the
drive back to the hall, Tim explained how he
believes in seat belts. He credited this beliefto
an event he offhandedly referred to as “the time
I killed Blome's cow."

Back in the Legion Hall,l drifted into the
kitchen looking for cooking work. My dad had
a cigarette clenched between his teeth and a
frozen pheasant in each hand we exchanged
greetings and he chucked the pheasants in a
toaster. The Julia Child disciple in me shudr

dercd inrtrnally. I told my farhcr rhar he
should defrost rhc pheasant first. He slanted
his cigarette upward resentfully and replied
that "defrosting and cooking are pretty much
the same thing."

Dad’s always defended his worst opinions
the most aggressively (like rhe time he bought
everyone in rhe family marching shoes), I don

do better for itselfin the next world

Taking a wider view otrhe kirchen, l realr
izcd my father's judgment wasn't the excepr
tion to rhc rule, A group of men were “sans
te’ing" onions in a quarter
inch of lukewarm water
in order to “soften" them
before they were put in
the baked beans. I began
a perhaps inappropriately
long definition ofthe word
saute’ and questioned the
need to sorrcn somerhing
that’s going to be put in a
pressure cooker. They re
garded rrre with suspicion
and distrust.

My rrnt piqued the ins
teresr of rhe only woman
in the kitchen,MaeJenn,a
woman in her
80s who was watching from the
rear corner. She asked me to sweat
the cclcry and onions for her stuffs
ing. Our mutual outcast status so,
lidificd into an alliance to defend
the stufﬁng from (he incursions or
those wishing to “improve" it, At
one point I stared down a burly
man rn camouﬂage coming at us with a mo
pound bowl of turkey livers while Mae Jean
physically interposed herseltand the snrmng

Soon a man circled the kitchen yelling,
“Deer sticks!" He handed a handful of deer
jerky to the Ikes. Deer sticks paradorieally
manage to disappoint by tasting exactly like
you expect them to. Out of the corner of my
eye, 1 saw my father holding a cigarette with
his right hand and awkwardly trying to chop
onions onerhanded with his left. In his mouth,
he had a deer stick and he tried to feed lumr
seltmore ofit by jerking his neck backward to
propel the deer meat into his throat.

This multitasking terminated in a com-

my father was having his first beer of the day.
It was 10:34 am.

As noon approached, Mac Jean and 1 mixed
nearly so pounds or stufﬁng, Since we didn't
have bowls for the job, we mixed everything in
three giant military sinks, Shortly after that,
Grandpa told me we had to get back to their
house because Grandma had prepared lunch.

The noon meal consisted of loose mcat
sandwiches, soda and pudding. This meal was
the tipping pointwhere the day’s narrative got a
bit hazy, I'd been living a neatrvegan lifestyle at
Grinnell and by this time I had become sort of
“meat drunk." The remaining hours ofthe days

passed as more ofa series ot
hcnty impressions viewed
through a gauey veil ofchOr
lesterol and protein. I spent
most of the early afternoon
face-up on my grandparents
floor- before we ventutcd
back to the Legion Hall for
the final game feed preparar
tion. Now, describing meat
as “a pile” ls mther cliche.
For instance, one might say
n subway sandwich is “piled
high" with nrrkey. This is
an exaggeration. But at the
game feed dinner, no cxagr
getatlon is possible. The
meat was piled high, in the sense that it was
actually served as a giant pile.

The peak ofthc evening was the rattleTlre
prizes were procured by a couple of the lkes
that went on a 32, 000 shopping spree at Walr
Mart. Aunrlulie won a beefjcrky maker. Iwon
a case ofnroror oil and a jug ofwrpcr ﬂuid. The
available prizes ranged from posters of kittens
to shotguns I was informed that the shotguns
were safely hidden under my uncles bed prior
to the arrction. Throughout the auction, Em,
ple kept cxclaiming what an excellent job my
uncle was doing ofcmcccing rhe evenr. This
confused me, he was mostly reading offa series
of prizes and winners without much comment.
Eventually I ﬁgured out that “excellentjob” was
code for “not drunk."

And then it was allover. After rhe guns and
the meat there was nothing to do bur sleep. 1
gave the wiper fluid to my Grandpa. He seemed
to appreciate the gesture.
