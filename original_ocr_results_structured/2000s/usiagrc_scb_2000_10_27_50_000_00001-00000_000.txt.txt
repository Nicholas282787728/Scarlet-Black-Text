architectutal ritm stsgman Plus Associates
ptcscntcd thcit tentative plans Tuesday for
ctinnsll’s ptoposcd student housing
renovations and discussed them with the
eight students and one RLC who attended

Janet stegman, whose previous housings

colleges and universities. asked and ﬁelded
questions on offvcitmpus housing plans,
envitoninental and economic tesponsibility,
and the nature ofliberal arts edtication for
appiotimatcly ttvo home in the Harris
Cinema not talk, she said, would hopefully
be thohtstiuascncs ordialcctic negotiations
with the student body, administration, and
architects; the second would occur in mid-
November.

The presentation had been intended to

Master Plan sketches had provided for the
demolition of Norris hall and a number of
off»campus collcgcvowncd houses and the
construction of: new set of dorms east of
Mac Field and a pait of large apartments
style complexes across East siteet.

The ﬁtst set of housing eonsttuction,
stcgman said, would most likely be
complete by autumn of 2003 ot
(optimistically) by autumn of 2002.

sevetal students immediately btought
up concerns about :i reduction in oileampus
houses. “There’s an incredible demand for
offccampus housing,"
said Katie Simmons ‘02.
She and Jesse
McClelland '01
described the success of
Music House and
sticssed the iinpottance
both or potential rot
themed housing and or
outsidecworld
interaction. Each of these functions, they
said, is cuttently fulﬁlled by occo
housing.

Many attendees wetc also skeptical of
the value ofcollcgvowned apattmentstylc
housing, which some students thought
would be unsightly to neighbots and which
might not orret the same advantages as
downtown apattments do today. “Having
yout own apattment with your own

tespuns‘ lity to clean is totally dittetcnt
[ftom dotm life]," said Simmons. ”You can't
match having your own apattment with
college-owned housing. it's not possible."

Stcgman said she, too, had been
skeptical at the otiginal proposal rot off-
eampus housing, and would ptoposc
changes in the longstange housing plan.

Most ofthe balance oftltc meeting was
spent discussing “the ideal building."
“We’ve got this design philosophy: you statt
with the student moms and you build out,”
explained stegman,

“\V/ltat we want to
do is to continue to
imptcve the quality or
intemttion bﬂwccn
students to encoutago
incidental meetings,"
she added. “we have
this goal to mix
populations actoss
this campus. . . .
Maybe it's a question of balancing ptivate
space with intetaction."

All students in attendance seemed to
tgtee to some extent with this goal of
integmtion. “we have relatively few cliques
on this campus," said McClelland.

“The ptoblem isn't that we don’t want

that we don't have enough space to shate."

students also discussed the possibility of
studcntrtcltdcd gatdcn space, the
maintenance of accessible hte escapes,
possible reatute that could teduce student
sttdss levels. and the importance or
continued student input dunng the housing
design process.

“I would hope that the housing aspect
is mote in line with students," said
McClelland, who said he had been distutbcd
by a lack orstudent input in othet ateas or
the Mastet Plan. “I’m almost glad I’ll be

“We nccd yout help in getting people
