Hate crime legislation

BY DAVID LOGAN

in February, two homophobic acts shook
Grinnell College. The Grinnell Police Der
partment issued awarrant in connection with
the first crime and classiﬁed it as a hate crime.
But the second incident, which involved lets
tcrs with homophobic slurs speciﬁcally tare
geted or members of the crinncll College's
queer community, cannot be classiﬁed as a
hate crime under Iowa lnwr Some Grinnell
students are working to change that.

Upon learning that the letters could not
be prosecuted as a hate crime,]ordan Levine
‘10 and Meredith Decker ‘10 began working
toward promoting a law that would allow
law enforcement agencres to classify lnCl’
dents similar to the mailings as hate crimes.
“It’s more than just harassment," said Levine.
“And we feel it should be punished as such."

Alec Schictenbeck '09, who is currently

interning in the ofﬁce of State Representa-
tive Eric Palmer and providing assistance
to Levine and Decker, said that it was too
late to present any legislation in the current
legislative session and that any attempts to
change the hate crime laws would have to
wait until the next session. “They’re in the
middle of the budgetary process which prev
ty much sucks out all of the oxygen of the
legislative process," said Schictellheck. “And
they're close to adjournment."

Levine and Decker are trying to draft an
ofﬁcial consensus statement to disseminate
among state legislators in order to, according
to Levine, “start a dialogue on the issue.”

In the meantime, Schierenbeck provided
Levme and Decker With a list of potential
contacts through his role as President of the
Young Democrats and campus Democrats

Assault at Grinnell

Student’s history of violence raises
questions about college’s policies

BY SARAH MlllK

Gerad Ryan, formerly ’09, had trouble living peaceﬁllly in
Grinnell's small community, Poweslllek County court records
tell part otthe story of the tworandrarhalt years he spent as
a student here: arrested in November 2006 for ﬁghting and
disorderly conduct, in August 2007 for public llltoxlcation and
ﬁnally pleading guilty to thirdrdcgrce harassment this March.

Ryan’s experience at Grinnell reveals how the college deals

of the community lice

the college’s case-by-

violate school policy, the
question lingers as to where administrators should draw the

One of those reported assaults was when Ryan allegedly
wrapped a belt around his hand and punched another student
at the Fetish Harris party in November 2006. The case was
dismissed in courtY but according to his friends, Student Affairs
decided to suspend Ryan for a semester.

Rcturning to the small campus after the semcstsr suspenr

Norman Finkelstein
to speak at Grinnell

BY SARAH ERVIN

on Monday April 21, the Palestinian Solidarity Group
(PSG) will bring controversial scholar Norman Finkelstein to
the campus. The political science professor was recently denied
tenure at DePaul University for, according to Finkelstein, his
inﬂammatory views about the Israel-Palestine conﬂict. Finkel-
stein's strong support of Palestine and vocal disdain of Jewish
scholars like Alan Dershowitz have made him a contentious fl -
ure in many academic circles.While the campus has not seen any
noticeable controversy about Finkelstein, there is some debate
about how much his divisive reputation affected the decision of
some college ofﬁces to provide ﬁlnding for the event.

In October, members ofthe group traveled to Chicago
to hear Finkelstein. Noam Chomsky, and others speak at a con»
ference called “In Defense ofAcademic Freedom."PSG mem-
bct Rcbecca Johnston ’09 said she was impressed by his speech
and decided to look into bringing him to Grinirelmale's a smart,
funny guy,"she said.

According to Johnston, PSG hopes that Finkelstein can CX’
pose students to a point of view outside of what they see as heavt
ily pro-Israel media coverage of the Middle East. Johnston said
that, despite Finkelstein's contentious views, she has not yet ens
countered any negative reactions to Finkelstein's visit, although
she understands sonic people’s feelings of resentment toward
him. “It’s a really touchy subject,"shc said, “but 1 think that we're
a relatively mature campus.”

Some rudcnts, however, feel that his rhetoric is aggressive
and polarizing. Chalutzim member Rebecca Heller ’11 said, “I
wish a speaker would have been brought who would encourage
dialogue on both sides. That’s the biggest disappointment."
