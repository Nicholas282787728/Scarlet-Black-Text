There and baek again: a DAGtale

iiYJAMEs ANTHOFEK

Daghorhit (DAG) has always been something ofan enigma
for the typical Gtinnell student. From unfounded rumors of
DAG orgies to the group’s ramhunctious l-ielcl Day (a gather-
ing ofGrinnsll DAG participants past and present, and DAG
groups from other colleges) and the whimsical Remnssanee
Fairc, the ﬁghting club often seems to be regarded with a ln|X’
ture ofadmiration for their amhition and apprehension ofthe
lifestyle that accompanies such antics.

Fear not. DAG house, which has been a collegesowned offs
campus project house since 2003. is, at its heart, just like any
other messy and anarchic off-campus ltousciexccpt for the
basement full ofweapons and the sewing machine on the din-
ing room table.

Visitors are greeted at the door of1023 Park street (kitty-
cornet from Bucksbnum) by both Halloween and Christmas
lights, and a snowman with an arrow through his heart. There
is no question that it is DAG house, home to Denny Vaccaro
’11, Brooke \Nebei ’10, Hugh Potter '10, Alex Peterson ’11,
M.E. Kennedy '11, Natalie Clark '12, and Alexi Brooks '10. I
later found out from Kennedy that the proper way to describe
the decoiations is “midway between Salwyn and Solstice," two
pagan wintei holidays.

sitting in the living room,with swords mounted unsteadily
on stands on the wall, 1 learned that the seven people who oc-
cupy the house recognize then mysterious status on campus,
but are not sure they really deserve it. “Besides sharing the
house with ﬁfty different sorts of foam weapons, it's basically
a normal house," said Kennedy. who genemlly speaks for the
rather quiet household

In fact, DAG house is quieter than it has ever been in its
five-year history. “The social scene has totally switched around,"
said Hugh Potter ’09,who lived in the old DAG house at 1128
East street last year. The reticent, neatly alvmys shoeless Pore
ter gave a simple explanation for this switch. “A lot of people
graduated last year, and so the house kind of lost that heavy
drinking culture"

Still, the residents’ relationship with Facilities Management ,

may hordet on hostility, but that is not because of party clean
up, and is rather due to their dcfccatlonapmne pet bunnyThis
yearshouse generally identiﬁes as sub free and has not hosted
the parties and social gatherings that made it such a huh of
activity last year.

Neat midnight, one is more apt to find the houses residents
umtehing an episode of 051 in the living room than drinking
mead and shooting each other with arrows “It might change
when alumni come back in April [for the annual Field Day
event] but that’s about it," Kennedy said.

The current location only houses half as many people as the

old DAG house. which means a lot ofinherired weaponry for a
much smaller army, “The basement is full ofweapons from the
old house," said house resident Danny Vaccato '11s “We only
really use it as a storage space, but it scares me."

This also means that the house has less space to design and
create new weapons. which explains the sewing machine, foam,
and spray paint on the dining room table, which has yet to host
a house dinner. “I remember last year, when I lived in Laziet,I
used to go over to DAG house all the time to create weapons,"
kennedy said. “That doesn't happen as much this year."

The low-key atmosphere does not mean the members of
the house do not host plenty of prospies or continue to play
a large role in community outreach. “Plenty of prospies still
sleep over,” Kennedy said. "We also had a bunch ot[professors’]

its departments come over fall break, because we have a lot of
professors kids who go to practice, though you have to he 14 or
over to participate."

such community building events prove DAG will endure
as a powerful force on campus, whether or not the house is as
crazy as it has been in past years. Especially since their com-
munity building events on campus might get a little crazy to
make up for it. “I thought of Steam Punk [a sci- -ﬂ theme' in a
Victorian- -era milieu] Harris a long time ago, but I‘m not sure
about it ’Potter said.

“We might Just stick with the Renaissance Faire,’ Kennedy
added.
