BV MERRICK MEYERS

Take heart, casual dressers: since inv
digo (lye is a traditional sign of wealth,
your wonrout blue jeans may acmaliy
be the snazziest rhing you own.

An exhibit of indigo-dyed quilts,
“Indigo Gives America rho Blues," is
currently showing in rhe Faulconer
Gailery in the Bucksbaunr center tor
the Arts.

The display includes a wide variety
otquiits, selected from over a period of
centuries, with only one common teas
tore: the use ofindigo dye,

The exhibit is on loan from the Inc
ternational Qrilt Studies Center at the
University of NebraskarLincoln. The
Curator of Exhibitions of the Center,
Marin Hanson ‘95, is a Gtrnncll alrrm.

There were several exhibits avail—
able, brrr, according to Faulconer Di-
rector Lesley wright, "Ofthe ones that
were available when we were looking,
this one looked particularly strong and
interesting." The cxhibit's curator and
an assistant came from Nebraska to
help hang the show.

Indigo, said Wright, is a historically

With rhe advent of indigo dye,
blue clothing (and blue quilts) became
more affordable for all. Today, rhe dye
is used to make, among other things,
blue jeans.

The Faulconer director's said that
the quilt show is to a certain extent
a “crowd plcasct" designed to attract
viewers tor the Frank Btcucr photor
graphs also being displayed there, but
stressed that the quilt exhibit also has
great artistic merit ofits own.

Faulconer hosted a concert ruspiretl

American composers. The concert, en-
tirled “Simple Gifts," was performed by

Grinnell’s utility
poles appear in
photo series

xv MERRICK MEYERS

The exhibit by German artist Frank
Breuer contains photographs taken rn
diverse locations from across Europe
and America, but you ean’r tell by look
ing at them,

The photographs are otrailway box-
cars, utility poles, roadside signs, plain
burlrirngs and ubiquitous corporate lo-
gos'7things found nearly everywhere
in the modern urban landscape.

Breuer's photographs are currently
on display at rhc Faulconer Gallery in
the Bucksbaum Center for the Arts,

The photographs are meant [0 de
picr themes orcomrncreialisnr and her
rnugeneiry, Breuer explained in a talk at
Faulconer onThursday, Sept, 7.

The corporate imagery depicted in
the images has pervaded every aspect of
our lrves,but, ire stressed, natural rmags
cry can also be seen creeping into the
pictiitcs.“The romantic idea of nature,"
he said,“takes back its territories."

Many of Breuer's photographs were
taken in Europe, but his most recent
series, that of utility poles, was done in
the Unrted States. Four of the photos
were taken in Grinnell last year.

This is the first time Breuer’s work
has been exhibited in a museum setting
in the United States, though his pirates
graphs have previously beeoreatured in
gallery shows in New York.

Faulconer associate director Dan
srrong praised the images for rheir ex-
ceptional crispness and clearness, and
the "almost abstract"qualiry of Breucr's
photographic technique.

The gallery had planned to exhibit
Br-eucr's work last spring, bur rhe plans
were put on hold until now so as not to
conﬂict with other exhibits.

The exhibit was designed by Brcuer
himself, a rare event for Faulconer Gair
lcry. Brcucr said he was daunted by the
exhibition area's large size, which was
mueh bigger than he envisioned.

He had the college create the series
of white walls that now'stands in the
center of the gallery, thus creating the
impression of a smaller, more intimate
space.

The photographs wrll remarn rrp
until sepr. 17.

In a gesture of thanks foi putting
on the exhibit, Breuei will be giving the
college one photograph as a gift.
