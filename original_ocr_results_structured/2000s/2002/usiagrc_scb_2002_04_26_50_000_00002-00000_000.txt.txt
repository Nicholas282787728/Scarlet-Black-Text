p.m. in the Flanagan Studio Theatre. The play, by Caryl

GOV. TOM VILSACK's budget standoff with Republican
Lawmakers continued this week as both the House and
Senate adjourned without anyact'ion. VilsacKs proposal to
divert £60 million in highway funds to education was
rejected. "It’s really a choice of kids or 20 miles of concrete,"
a Vilsack aide protested. The legislature also cut funding
for the in-your-face "JUST ELIMINATE LIES” antirsrnoking
ad campaign by $4.3 million. Legislatures said the cuts
were a matter of priorities. "Our choice came down to
providing basic health care for children or continuing this
smoking-cessation program," Senate President MARY
KRAMER said. STATE SEN. DENNIS BLACK (D-Grinnell)
said he plans to run for re-election, but because of
redistricting, he will no longer represent Grinnell or
Poweshiek County. Despite his Grinnell address, Black
actually lives in Jasper County, which is no longer part of
Gnnnell’s district. . The price of mailing a letter will go
up again this summer, as POSTAGE COSTS increase to 37
cents for a ﬁrst-class stamp and 23 cents for a postcard
stamp. The increase will go into effect June 30,
