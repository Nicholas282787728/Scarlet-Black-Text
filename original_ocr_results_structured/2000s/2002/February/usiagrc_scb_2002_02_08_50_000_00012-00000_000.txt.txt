Freezmg and failing in Cleveland

Every night when I’m walking home, [anticipate go-
ing to my nice cozy room. I open the door to ﬁnd an ice-
box. Errrrr. Everything I touch is cold. I can't touch the
furniture, I can’t touch my books, I can’t touch my com-
puter, I can't touch the floor, I have to put on six sweaters,
In the morning I can't even get out of bed. This whole
situation makes it very challenging to put much energyinto
my schoolwork, since it is presently being channelled to my
homeostatic processes 1 continually deciding between my
physical health and my education. In fact, I am so cold
right nowI cannot even write a coherent mndom rant. So if
anyone asks you why I’m failing, you can tell them it’s be—
cause my room is cold, FM, get your act together.

Penonologues
As we came upon another year of vagina-centric cel-
ebrations, i ﬁnd myselrwishing for a male equivalent. Per-
haps we could have a "love your penis week" during which
we could host phallus craft-making parties, sponsor a phal-
lussthemed special dinner, and, of course, produce a hilari-
ous, yet heart wrenching, set of monologues aboutthe male
genitalia To tellyou the truth, I’ve actually spent a consid—
erable amount of time traveling the country, talking to men
about their penises, and gathering their tales. My working
title furthis production is The Penanologues. To begin, we'd
wow audiences with a 45-second single orgasm. Then, jo-
vial shouts would erupt as we announce the "penis happy
fact": men control 97 percent ofthe world’s wealth. Only to
be followed by the tragic "penis sad fact": we still have 3
percent to go But, I don’t know. Perhaps such a crazyidea
is too progressive for this age. Who's to say—all I know is
that, men, we’ve done a lot over the years, and it’s about
time we celebrate.

Behold the power of no!

Adam Portilla ‘03 argues that the world would be a
better place if we all said yes more often. i encourage you
to answer him with a rousing, heartfelt no! From now on,
you will only do the things you really want to do; every
other invitation will be met with a resounding negative.
This does not make you a negative person; in not, you will
ﬁnd yourself more energized for those activities you can
sciously choose to do. How many times have you silently
dissented when a proressor tacked on another reading, when
a supervisor told you to get busier, when you're volun»
teered in a meeting for a task you don’t want to do? Try
saying no, and sense the awe and surprise or those around
you. It’s a strength that can he quickly regained and inﬁr
nitely repeated. Take control of your rambling life—just
say no!
