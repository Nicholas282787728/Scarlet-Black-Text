rhere's a good chance that you won’r see me whole movie.

irs course, and rhrough some serendipiey, or "maldng tor—
runare discoveries accidenrally," rhey ﬁnd each other ten
years and a million and a halfhours later. Ofcourse, there
are sire rypiral orher “wedding plans" ro break up.

B: Like always, it’s the girl that mass up the relationa
ship, This movie is a :ypial romantic oomedy, akin to Skep-
zerr in senate New York Ciry looks magical rhroughour
the film. It has an excellent cast. Cusaek has made a mteer
out of romantic comedies, and Beckinxalc never looked so
cure. The superb Jeremy Fivcn, Eugene Levy, and a sur-
prisingly rolerable Molly Shannon add much ro rhe movie.

J: The grrl always messes up rhe relationship? lrrhcre
