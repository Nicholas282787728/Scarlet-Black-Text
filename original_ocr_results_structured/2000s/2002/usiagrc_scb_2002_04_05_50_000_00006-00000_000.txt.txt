His joy

Greg had a lively, impish quality about him, which manl-
fested itself all the time in our ballet Has He'ahd Erin were

constantly up to some kind of Pilubolus- like moves, and he '

had plans to make a dance Titular Head movier Somehow,
even the clothing Greg wore communicated this vivacity
Not only did he have a pair of very saucy black shorts with
the word “banter” scrawled across die butt, but he would
also routinely wear some women’sblack stretchy bellbottom
pants. Very fetching His most infamous garment, however,
was a pair of shrunken wafﬂeeweave long underwear that
had somehow seemed like a good ‘ ,
class. Apart from looking very Sillyﬂtli‘
ripped audibly at every plie that Greg!
grand plie (a' dance move that-

whole class heard a huge RED? .and Greg: face turned
bright red. Luckily, Greg had worn boxers that day, so no
vital parts were exposed. Nevertheless, those long-under-
wear pajama bottoms never showed up in class again, and
Greg went back to his former "Dancer” shorts, Thankfully,
these shorts had plenty ofspandex. ,

Ballet 103 will he a very differentplace without Greg, and I
will miss him.

Then, aft a

I met Greg when he came back from his semestei abroad.

'I was completely intimidauad by all of his accomplishments,

and was pathetically trying to be professionalwherl talking
with him and the ctr—leader of our subgroup about the up-
coming semester in HP. About midway through my plans to
take overenvironmenmlism in the state aflowa, Greg stopped
me. He said, "Just don’t forget that this is supposed to be
fun! ’Have fun and get shit done! That’s all you have to
wony about.” From then on, I got _a veryrdil’ferent picture of
Greg. In countless road trips to Des_Moines and other Iowa
cities and towns while planning a conference, Greg would

tell stories about all the amazing thingstliat he did in tho,

ﬁeld of environmennllsm, his work on
paign and as. a leader of campus'De

ear to bauet 1'

a great deal on a keg for a party, or had found the best bar in
Costa Rica, I can't imagine how Greg found time to drive me
across Iowa, but he would, and would wake up at 6:00 am in
whatever City to drive me back for my 8:00 a.rn. class, He was
supportive, eneounging and full or ideas to get me on the road
to my dreams, He was especially concerned with me stepping
ourside my boundaries; whenever i was uncertain about lack-
ling a new project, and hesitant about even starting, there was
Greg with another motto: ”You can’t procrastinate if you are
going to save the planet!" Greg knew the value of every day,
and I wish that he knows how I treasured then, and even more
so new, every moment I got to spend with him.

—Terrill leguen’ ’05

”The semesters going well," Greg Schriebei told me shortly
before spring break. "Classes aren’t that hard, I've got a girl-
friend, and we’ve had a party every weekend," These consistent
social gatherings that only added to a now sociallyewatered
down campus were very reflective of Greg’s charisma and charm.
While it may seem on the surface that his perpetual party-throw-
ing was only illustmtive of an insatiable appetite for keg bear,
it was more of Greg’s inner desire to keep everyone entertained,
everyone happy. He even sent out emails completely illustrated
in eolor photos advertising for his soirées at his house on Sixth
Ave

His donation of keggers to a party-bereft campus mirrored
his love for a rich environment, the latter a natural one and the
former a social one, While Greg’s desire for unity and friendship
emanated from within, his casualwlt and subtle humor kept his
party guests in proverbial stitches.

I loved Greg for not only who he was but also what he
wanted to become: a universal friend, an environmental merce-
nary, and a generally good person. I can’t grieve his absence as
much as I can delight in the past his soft voice permeating the
synapses of my recall. I get through the day with the knowl»
edge of Greg's presence not only in my memory, but also my

’. heart; he will always be there.
