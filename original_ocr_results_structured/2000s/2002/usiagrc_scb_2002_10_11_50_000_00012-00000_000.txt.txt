During the recent loss of hot water, Quad used dis-
posable dishesi We know this was unavoidable. But why
the insistence on baking these nonebiodegradable dishes
and throwing them away? Since the dishes are simply
going to take up space in a landﬁll, why shouldn't stu-
dents take the ones theyve already used back to their
rooms, wash them, and get a few more uses out or
them? Two of us at least attempted this. We were
stopped at the door and told that we HAD to throw
those dishes away Why? The only reason we could elicit
was, ”We'd ratheryou didn’t do that," Lest we become
Quad outlaws, we ﬁnally did as instructed. Was there a
logical reason why we were not allowed to do anything
to mitigate the huge waste of resources involved in
using disposable dishes? can't think of any.

Two weeks ago, someone shit allover the carpet
and in the men's bathroom on Read 3rd. Our carpet is
still stained. But beyond my outrage at your inconsid-
eration and repulsiveness toward me and everyone else
on Read am, I'm curious if you lhought or the poor
oppressed janitor who had to pick up feces on Thurs-
day mornlng because you couldn't trouble yourself to
sit down, I’ve had it with this sort of lack of respect for
the campus and for the people who have to clean up
after us. Ican think of numerous examples: the bloody
handpnnts, those who glue their signs to bulletin
boards, the assholes that stash campus bikes in the
bushes, and of course my friend who desecrated our
carpet. For all of the liberal Sentiment around here, it
sickens me that certain persons can’t trouble them-
selves to treat their own damn campus with respect.
Come on people.

Sidewalk chalk: those two words bring the great
warm fuzzy reeling of kindergarten back to me
without fail each time I hear them.

I’m always glad to see that Grinnellians have not
forgotten the greatness of their kindergarten days.
Preserving the craft of sidewalk writing is a noble
cause that we must keep no matter how many classes
we take for $30,000/yr. I don’t always agree with
other students, but I always like to read what they
have to say.

Each time I pass a colorful message, Itry to read
itas I walk by. however, despite my conscious efforts
to keep moving, some messages grab my attention
and become my honest excuse for being late to class.
Some of the "coming out" messages this week have
grabbed me in just that way, and I commend their
artists for enlightening my day,
