Peace Corps couple sets
out to change the world

It won‘t be yoirr typical honeymoon.

The Peace Corps doesn't send iis volunteers to tradi.
tional vacation spots, but a row months after their wetl—
ding in September, Pete Olson and Janet McLaughlin will
be heading orrier parts unknown on a twoycar stint with
the international service organization.

They don't know where they’ll be yer,The Peace Corps
tries to march volunteers to places where they'll be happy
but Olson and MeLaughlin weren't too spcclﬁc on their
applications. “We’d like to go to Afrlcn or Latin America
or someplace in the southern Paciﬁc, but we were pretty
open," Olson said.

“We’ve both seen verylrtrle erthe world." McLaughlin
added “we havent traveled much, so anywhere will be
exciting,"

Olsensaid he thought aboutstudying abroad, but never
went through with all the steps involved in spending a so
mester orr.campus. He ﬁnally decided it would be better
to “live a real lire abroad" instead oriiist taking classes

Getting married allows them to ask the Peace Corps to
assign them to a Iocluon together. Though they'd marry
anyway, Olson and McLaughlin, who met at the begins
ning of their sophomore year, say being able to enlist to»
gerhet gave them a reeson to do itsooner.

The most frightening thing about going into the peace
Corps, Melaughlin said, is not the move to a new coirn.

be In two years."

The “Star Trek" tutorial

“You go to a really cool collegel" Or.
"What kind creollcge do you g0 tow"

Aimee Hutton gets both those ttsponses
from other people when she confesses the
subieer other ﬁrsreyezr tutorial: star Tye/e.

Ten members or 1998': sire Trek tutee
rial will graduate this month, Four years ago,
they spent the early morning hours on Tues
day and Thursday in the basement or the
scienoe building wirh lantt Gibson, Psyv
chology, reading books on the physiCS,
metaphysics, and biology or the 1960s TV
show and its many spineoirs.

The group also took a ﬁeld trip to the
supposed birth plate omer Trek character
JamesT Kirk in Riverside. Iowa. The town
boasts a “big model ofrlxcEnthrlxt," said
Hutton.

“A picturestrll hangs on my omee wall
ora group or us who went to see the Enta-
ptne," Gibson said.

several students also went to see the
eighth stat we movie, Insist-mantra in Des
Memes and ate dinner at ihe spaghetti

Olson added. “The worst thing will be missing Tamrly
and Frlcnds, and the chance that rri two years you’ll fall out
orcenracr with some or those friends."

The Peace Corps tries to pirt volunteers in areas where
they have some experience. Olson, who grew up on a farm
in Nebraska, listed fanning, animal husbandry and con.
strntrion work so his areas ofcxpcrtlse McLnglllln, who
was a summer camp assistant dirt-trot last summer, listed
gardening, health care, and community scnice work.

Neithcr knows what kind orjob they will ultimately
end up doing for the llcxr nvo ynirs, but McLaughlin knows
where she doesn't want to be: enclosed by (our walls

“I want to be outside," McLaughlin said, “really cxpe»
noticing that tonstantly 1 don't want to be stuck inside
reaching bemuse you’re teaching whatever you do."

MtLaughlin, an art lnxjm with a ton ntration in Latin
American studies, graduated last winter. Since then, xllc's
worked hrlltime as a temporary office assistant in the ﬁ-
nancial aid omoe.

Olson will graduate this month with a degree in Palms
cal science.

Then plans Tor after the Peace Corps are up in the air.
“I've kind oreonseiously tried to avoid [plarirrirrgl," Olson
said. “Ifl have more oran open mind, I'll be willing to let
wherever happens happen,"

Although some doubt that a Tv show
could be rhesubyeer orserious study. Gibson
said, she believes there’s a lot to learn from

“People tease me about the tutorial but

Freshen! Paroda

Opportunity knocks

thalu Paroda phrases his past, prtsent, and {more around the word
“opportunity." In a 45—minute description eihrs rout years at Grinnell, he
uses it perhaps two dozen times. Sometimes, he knows. this tan set him
apart From the perceived mainstream culture orcrinnell College.

“My Free the Planer fricnd suggested that i go work for Green corps,”
he said in an interview this week. “I was like, ‘Tliey'll look at my re»
$ume~Grlllnell Entrepreneurs, student Endowment investment Club. .
Paroda trailed eerin a laugh.

An Economics maior from New Delhi, India, Paroda has surrounded
lrimseliwirh variations on the theme orenterprise during his rouryears in
lowa. Rounding out his resume are his years as strident government trea.
surer and assistant treasurer and an internship last summer at the World
Bank in Washington, DC, Nextycarllc’s going to New York City to look
for a Job in investment banking or consulting, with an eye towards even.
tually becoming a private—sector investor tor the World Bank.

When he came to Grinncll in 1998,
Paroda wouldn't have expected anyone here
to have anything but pmisc for, say, the kind
oremployment he found last summer. “lsort
orthought orthe us. as a capitalist zone,"
he said, “I was sort of shocked."

Though he smiles at Grrniiells generally
lertrst reﬂexes, Paroda is serious about the
problems ornarrewamindedness.

“I always think there are two ways to
ehange the world," he said. “One is by aetiv.
ism and one is by actually entering eorporations and changing them.
Nor everyone who works tor a big company is :vllirhcy'r: just working
as hard as they can."

Paroda hopes that he's done his part to battle knceierk antieapitalism
at Grinnell as president orcrinnell Entrepreneurs this year, The group's
events, he said, have attempted to communicate the cxcltemenl and hm
or the business world.

“it's not just about big corporations." he :xplnineni "Its about :nlre»
preneurs, it's about ideas."

Orrnnell deviates rrom mainstream Amerian culture in more ways
than one, though. The college's awareness or the world outside the us
and the actions it takes to improve the world through groups like Am-
nesty lntcrnational. is admirable, he said, and helped to break downsome
ofllls own prejudices.

“It iiisr changed my idea orwhatrt means to bean American, and how
many drrrerent kinds orrlmerietns drere are," he said.

And in the end, Grinnell may orrer oxattly the sort orsoeiety that
Paroda is looking for. “I don't think anybody ean think about going to talk
to trustees at a school eiaoooo," he adds. “I think in crinnell, ifyou try,

you cm change a lot."
