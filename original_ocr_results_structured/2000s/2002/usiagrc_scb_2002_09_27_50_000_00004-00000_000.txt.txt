What do students need to
do to use the wireless
network?

1. Buy a wireless card
($130)—avaibble through
Karen [McIiitchie] at ITS.
2. Insert the card into your
laptop.

3. Most computers should
conﬁgure automatically.

Plans for the future?

0 Email kiosksistudents
can check their email while
waiting in line at the
dining halls. One computer
at each dining hall would
most likely be locked down
on tile Webmail page, so it
can only be used for
checking erriail. Possibly
also available in Bob's, ARH
hallway, and the Forum.
