The 8&8 talks with SGA Student Services Coordinator Christina Doxsie ‘03 about campus bikes

0: What do students have to do to use a campus
bike? Are they stored somewhere, or do they
need to be dropped off anywhere?
A: The campus bikes are stettered all over campus for
anyone to use If you see a neon orange bike that is
not lurked, you son hide the hike wherever you want.
When you are ﬁnished, you can leave the bike anywhere on
campus. Feel free to ride the bikes on rampus, butjust be
sure to return them to campus when you are ﬁnished. in
make the bikes more identiﬁable, we plan to
add streamers to the handlebars as soon
as we find some at a reasonable price,

0: How many are there?
How many have been
broken so far?

A: SEA currently owns ten bikes,
Three bikes have been broken so
rer, one or which is beyond repair.

50, there are seven bikes in working

condition on campus right now, but
soon there will be nine.

0: Are there more coming?

A: There are no deﬁnite plans to purchase more bikes, but,
judging by the favorable response to the bikes thus far, it is
very likely that more will be added. If anyone would like to
donate or sell a bike to the (ampus bikes program, they
should let us know.

0: Who fixes the bikes when they break?

A: They are taken to hike: to You in downtown Grinnell.
Craig, the owner of Bikes to You, donates his time to ﬁx the
bikes, so SGA only has to cover the cast of parts.

Q: How much do they cost to repair, and to
buy? How expensive would they have to
become before SGA would stop repairing or
replacing them?

A: SGA has allotted approximately 1350 per semester to
maintain the bikes, purchase new bikes, and cover any
miscellaneous expenses that may arise (for example, spray
paint and streamers). Repairs on each bike range from 521)
to 340. since seven or the bikes donated to the program
last year were in need of repair even before they were

pleeed on campus, we have already spent use. Although
we are hesitant to pour too much money into this program
until we are convinced that the bikes will not he stoten, we
plan to look ror other sourtes or intone tor the campus
hikes program,

0: What ifpeaple stash them in their rooms or
off campus ar something?

it: Our hope is that this will not happen, Since the campus
bikes are part or the public domain, everyone should take
iesponslbillty for the" proper use. If you see a bike stashed
behind bushes or in someone's room, please move it to d
more public location. Also, if you see a bike in need of
repair, it would be greatly appreciated ifyou would take it
to the SGA Ofﬁces in the Forum basement.

doxsie invites questions, comments, and suggestiuns about
the program [email service@gnnnell.edu or roll x3315.
