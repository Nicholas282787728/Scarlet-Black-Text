Field of Dreams

Grinnell's slate-of—ihe-ai’t new athletic facility needs only a name

by Aly Beery
Staff Writer

It's a common beliefthat Grinncll College is
conﬁned to the area between Eighth Street
(Norris/PEC), Park Street (ARH/North Cam-
pus), Sixth Street (Fine Arts, Main), nnd East
Srrccr (South Campus). Aircr nil, within these
boundaries, one can cor. sleep, go so class, study,
play pool, take a banjo lesson, work our :it riic
PECin‘lI! more could there possibly be?

Ask any soccer, softball, or football players
and rnsy will undoubtedly cisirn ro spend quite
a bit ofrnns north ofElgl-ith Street. What is un—
charted territory ro many srudcnrs is z drcsrn
come true for oll1el’s—-—l.)mnd
new athletic fields. Five
ﬁelds, ro be precise: two seer
ccr practice ﬁelds, a soccer
performance Field, a softball
field, and a football practice
field, In addition to the
fields, several building were
constructed: observation
towers, srorsgc buildings,
and a dugout.

The new ﬁelds are“awe-
some", according ro men's socccr player Joc
Hansen ’05.

“I've been plnying soccer for ﬁfteen yCJN.ZI1d
our game ﬁeld is rns best onc I’ve ever played
on,” Hansen rnvcs. “I've pisycd on 50m: nice
ﬁelds."

Worncn's socccr pinycr Amonds Bushman
’04, shares Hansen's sentiment.

“We played in Boston, at MIT, and it was so
uneven and holey. It's amazing to be able ro ploy
on [this field]."

So, thI makes these ﬁelds so great? Mike
Burt. Associate Director of Facilities Manage-
rncnr, has the answers ro this question. First of
all, they are sand»bascd. With Ill: crcsprion of
riic softball outﬁeld, riic grcsn crrpcr orrurriiss

of the impressive new drainage system and riic
rapid percolation speed orwsrcr through ssnd.

pretty unusual ro l-iave ssnd.bsscd rurf," said
Burn “What makes us unions is that Wt: have
practice ﬁelds rinr :ir: sandrbased [in addition
to a porrorrnsncc ﬁeldl." Thor's nor nil—Burr
worked with Dave Ditzler, Fnciiirics
Management’s Torr/irrigsrion Specialist, ro es-
tablish the ﬁelds from seed, as opposcd to sod.
Think obour that: growing grass in sand, It’s n
very risky operation, and the isndscnpsrs knew
ir. They iilso knew that ill: highest quiiry rurr
for the rrcids wouldn't comc from sod. so, they
grinned, planted, nnd prayed for good wcnrncr.

Forrunsrciy, the inndscsoo rcsni didn't hztve
to rely principally on the ﬁckle lows ciirnsrc ro
make the grass grow. Tiic
new ﬁelds are equippsd
with underground sprlllv

Bcnnlng also explained that n huge bcncnr

teams now play on s diitsrcnr ﬁeld rhsn they

marlly for club sporrs.

There's ,usronc problem; right now, rnc ncw
ﬁelds don't have nsmcs, so some sriiicrcs nnd
coaches have taken to referring to them ss “ill:
compisx".

“Psopis love the option to put rncir name
on n nsid," noted F:irclii1d,by dunatlng moncy

Niind Heto ‘05 describes the dirrcrcncc between

' the new ﬁelds and the old ones as “heaven and

hell.” And there is cvcn s sidewalk stretching ro
them from Eighth Srrccr.

Overall, gcncroi consensus is that the ﬁelds
