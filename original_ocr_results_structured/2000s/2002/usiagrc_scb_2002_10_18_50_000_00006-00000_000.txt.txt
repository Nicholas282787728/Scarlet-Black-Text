YoUr Favorite CD5

"I've got many iavorite CD5, but Daf Punk’s homework
albumis awesome, 1 can cruise, workout, study, chill, and
ance to those bad ass beats. I never get sick of listening
to it."

—Eraden Pence 'th

”Kind‘afBlue by Miles Davis. Vou can't go wrong with UIVS
aLbum."
I~Jce Benson '03

”I think it’s deaf: Built to Spill, Keep It Like 11 Secret. Wily:
because it has the necessary combination of rock, tempo
h e, valume variation, and male Tack, all topped off
just a hint oi melancholy."
Carl Damemw ’05

Lenny Kiavitz's Are You Going To do My Way because it runs
the gamut of human emotion."
—l)aniel Pederson ‘04

write Cl) is lame Credit Union's 18 month stepup.
’terest rates are always competitive, the minimum

deposit is surprisingly low and the penod oi nunrwilhdrawl

is relatively short."

iﬂavid Honig ‘06

‘de liver Troubled Water by Simon and Garfunkel. what
impresses me about this album are the perfectly matched
dual voices without sophisticated digital touchups. The
lyrics are reflective; the music is energetic, yet chill."
—Marian sourgeon "ad

“Dualirtle by The Pixies. Why: you listen to Doolitle and
suddenly, your head turns into a pumpkln! voui hands are
sLSb's of yellow waxl The Pixies rock your socks off and eat
them for breakfast—and you, 0 slimy, smiling iiend, are
\left lying on the floor, your bonny box oi brains changed
‘,into a mass of steaming bliss."
iiElena Bakaitis '04

“Marlee Macleod, there We Are iirst off, I‘m a sucker for a
concept album. Second, it's great ior everything, cleaning,
homework, drinking and singing along, and impressing my
friends with the duality of Minneapolis music. Great guitar
licks, diverse song structures and styles, and slick word
choices that only a someone with a degree in English could
I“ A relationship irom start to iinish, so you can have
or every mood you might be in regarding that
special or nat—so-special someone."
ikachel F rniag "02.5

you‘ve never heard oi. Latec‘SOS acid house pioneers do
gritty drum-'n-bass, jazzy wash electiardance, and a
spattering oi gorgeous, inindblowing vocal cuts with ii.
Doughty, louise RhUdes, James Dean siadheld, etc. The
only to 1 would ever think of taking drugs to listen to. A
litileknown classic nf its genre, it it has one."

——Joe Gem '05

”I guess I‘m a "bad boyfriend" for my cm; 1 tend to get
passionately attached to one ior about six months and play
it almost constantly, then throw it over for something new
which 1 then end up treating in approximately the same
fashion. Most recently, 1 listened to Dar Williams‘ Green
World practically until the laser chewed through to the
other side, then T got interested in The Sundays' Reading,
Writing and Arithmetic."

iMaik aaechtel, English

"l‘m so indecisive about calling something my ’favorite’ so I
have to pick two cds ihe Piano Soundtrack and CatPoweT‘s
MoonPix, oh wait, and any hadiohead album (that‘: three, 1
know, I know), hasically anything that's going to make me
have a good cry and depress the hell out oi me I‘m going to
love, Masuchisﬁc isn't it?"

—Oiailoue HESS ‘04

"I‘ll take John Coltrane‘s lush Life, the soundtrack of my
early teens and probably the record I most aspire to imitate
as a musician. As a lad, 1 dubbed my father's LP and wore
out the cassette in a Walkman doing my paper route every
afternoon. The album only has a few tracks: a handful oi
standards (including the famous title track) and ’Trane's Slo
blues."

iErik Simpson, English

“The Joshua Tree by uz, because it iades in at the
beginning, fades out at the end, and reilects so many
diiieient moods and feelings. And it makes me happy.“
—5arah Helgen ‘05

"My iavonte cd is by Jill Scott, called Who is Jill Scott. 1
like it the most because it is very mellow, and T can
(attempt tu)sing along."

~Megan Beam" '03

"My favorite co has to be Odelay by Beck. it has breadth;
the CD contains hip-hop, honky tonk, metal, iunk, indian
music, rock, hillbilly, electronica, folk and so much more. it
also has innovation. nothing really before of since has been
so avantrgaide, yet popular. 1 mean the guy had hip-hop
songs about truckers with him playing bany'o. who the hell
else does this, not to even mention pulling it off?"
h‘n going '05. ‘

"My favorite cu is Gaihage's beautiful Garbage. Garbag has
really opened my eyes as to the incredible variety oijniusic
that a single band can incoiporate into theil music and stlll
maintain a sounds that is unigue and exciting every inei
listen to it," «‘
4am Beaudin '03

”At the moment, it's tatPowers WaonPix. Perfect for a rainy
day, ior studying. Ideal to sing along with when drunk
because 1 can belt it out and not care at all thatT can't
sing it I'm sober. It‘s kind oi a calming anchor and the best
cure I've got for rotten days,"

ikachel oreyer '04

”Afghan Whigs’ centlcmen. It‘s an intoxicating so min
at sexual pathos, tortured soul man vocals, and blues~
meets—noise guitar solos. The whigs were one of the r
bands to merge indie rock and past-punk with a deep
knowledge or has phrasing and ieel. lyrically, Greg Dulli
makes you want to purge any Czthulic sexual guilt you
might have along with him even it you‘le not Catholic."
—tolin Seiler ’04

“My iavonte to totally depends on my mood, bull
narrow it down to two in general, so take your pi
Maduna’s Immaculate collection and Dirty dancing, be

I can sing along, 1 can dance to the songs, they both
improve any mood that I'm in, and i can iantasize aboii
Patrick Swayze while listening to it." ,
—Alisun Phillips '03

”Die Presidents of the United States oi Amen‘ca, self. ’
titledThey were the iirst band I saw live, and I also saw
their final live show, The album‘s so bursting with energy
that makes you laugh and sing along. Arid, after all,

'tverybody wants to be naked and famous.
iﬁiadley lveison-long '04

"My tavonte CD right now is Blue days Black Nights by
Ereedy Johnston, the guy who opened for Billy Bragg when
he came to Giinnell in 1999, Unlike his other, slightly
cheener albums, this one is all about a man, his
heartbreak, and a guitai~and he writes lovely, mel,
lyrics that don't get whiny. These are songs for com,
home alone attor a really suck~ass party."

iLuia Barber '03

"My favorite cd is Bob Dylan like who: Free Trude Hall

like this album because the ﬁrst half ofthe concertii Apu‘l’e .
folk: Dylan, a guitar and a harmonica. In the second half,

to the crowd‘s dismay, he comes out with a rock band and
launches into a bunch oi aggressive bluesy stuif, The sang’
'vis' Johanna’ on the acoustic set is perfect."
