Hoping to generare a wider audience for rlre 2003 yearbook, irs
editors tum to a banned book for inspiration.

In uddiu'on to irigir quality photognphy and minimal use ofrexr,
rlre 1966 yearbook features images depicting marijuana use, and
erireizes sex-based eollege policies as unfair ro women.

Cutmnt eclirors do nor expect rlreir book to be banncd, erring die
absence ordrugs in rlreir bookand a more ptogtessiv: college mindset.
“No, our book isn't going to ger banned," said (creditor Jenni Wu '05.
“We're not stupid (or mnybc brave) enougir in put in plrorogrdplrs of

Co-gdltorTon-l Beaudln also expected that modern {YCEdOmS will
aid in the publlmtion and distribution of the 2003 book “I'd like to
ftcl that the coll:g: has grown enough in the last 36 year: to undtrr
stand that rire yeubook needs to be a Composition that rruly reﬂects

piroros instead ofwotds," wu sru'd. “This book iris tczlly strong pho-
togtrlphs and a lor ofwcll-used white space."

Tirese changes have resulred in srrﬁelrenges, as well. Reeenr year-
book suits have consisted mainly of wrirers, wirlr d (aw photogra-
phets. This year rlre srdiirirus one wrirer.

“Our sraltwos very edreiirlly eirosen." Wu said. “This was slrgirrly
controversial, but we rirougirr that it was important to more a group
ofpcoplc wiro wt: knew eould produce quality work and work well
wirir rire other stafflncmbets."

The yearbook'x new vision has also resulred in new funding t:-
quests. Editots' accouan oirireir meetings with rire Student Publica-
rions and Radio Cor-omissee differ. Deuing with SPARC “has been a
debacle." said Wu.

Beaudln was more oprinrrsrie rbour smc funding “1 don't
envision ﬁnding my problems," ire sud. “Some upgrades in equip-
nrenr and supplies were necessary. bur only because th:y have been
negleered for so many yearsduem alack ofmoncyavailabl: ro SPARC."

past," sord Jacob KaufmnneOsbom '04, smncs business manager.
“My main concern is Lhatlthe book] won’t sell well. It'd be i concern
with my ofthe publications, except riris is the only one that sells."

Thc magnitude of the yearbook changes also makes Kaufmzn»

Tire editors expressed fajd'l in th: ibilirres of riroir suit. “The

that more talentcd photographers would come out orrlre woodwork
