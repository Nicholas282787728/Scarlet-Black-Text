To whom ir may concern:

As srudenrs ofa Gender and Women’s Studies course here ar
Grinnell college, we have begun ro norree flaws wirhin rho sysrem
concerning sexual misconducr. lr is a common nriseonceprion on
due campus rhar rape and sexual assaulr simply don’t happen here.
The facr is ir does and ir does so wirh alarming frequency we are
wriring ro encourage awareness ofrliis facr and re bring ro lighr (err
rain problems in rhe way rhings currcnrly are handled. we feel rhar
m rhe pasr, vicrims seeking help have nor been adequarely supperred
by rhose who deal wrrh eases involvlng sexual miseondurr. Also, we
feel rhar srudenrs are nor properly edueared abour rhe srudenr code
ofeonduer or encouraged ro review rhis eerde ror themselvcsi Why
does discussion of mu subieer end afrer New Saudenr orienrarron
week? The issue of sexual misconducr is complicared and many fac.
ered. Example #1 of possible sexual misconducr rhar is offered in
your srudenr manual mighr surprise much of rhe campus, we need
us know our rights and whar we can and mnnor be punished For. we
hope rhe adminisrrarion will encourage furrher discussion of die
subrlerres of our srudenr code of conducr and rhar srudenis will rake
rhe rime ro review and be respecrful of rhem.

I admire and applaud rhe proponencs' (Mails French ’03, Gabe

one of rhe main argumenrs for rhrs change is rhar ir will allow me
SGA presidenr ro berrererpress hrs opinions because a good preside

rhar rhe arrrele was very negarive roward rhe enrire sysrem To rhe

gone above and beyond call ofdiny is help keep me in school, Even
