grizzled talent are just two reasons why
this team - with a chip on its shoulder
after ﬁnishing 1/2rgame out of the
playoffs last year . is predicted by many
to win the tightly contested conference.
Grinnell is deep and talented across the
board, and with co-captain defensemen
John Wray '03 and Sam Taylor ‘02.

led by playmakers like Joe hansen '05 .
will be able to more than hold its own.

Key Game: vs. Lake Forest, defending

Volleyball

Last year: tied for 7th place, MWC

The skinny: Middle hitter Lura Barber
'03, setter Stephanie Schmidt ’03, and
outside hitters Maria Hiharger’OS and
Dinah Zebot '03 are just four of the
reasons Grinnell should he formidable.
The Pioneers return all but two players
from last year, and all their experience

Pioneers against topﬂight competition.

The skinny: The team lost four—time MWC
champ Hilary MinnicK, but the Pioneers
aren’t down thanks to two—time top-10
conference finisher Ashley Pausig '03

Women’s Tennis

Last year: 5th place, ch

The skinny: Unfortunately, Grinnell lost
top singles player Maiko Morotarii to
graduation. Fortunately, doubles ace Sid
Khajuria '05 returns. Unfortunately,
thanks to a host or players studying
abroad, Grinnell returns just two others
from last year’s learn. Fortunately,
thirdryear coach Barb Waite has
routinely gotten the most out of young
talent. Don't be surprised if she does it
again.

Football

Last year: 5-5, 5-3 uwc (4th)

The skinny: Greg Wallace's Pioneers were
at least the Midwest Conference's HZ
team last year until the injury bug hit.
Assuming good health all around,
Grinnell could well get that high or
higher this time with 17 returning
starters from last year’s outﬁt. DE Zach
Fletcher '03 and DB Jim Schueller ’03
anchor the defense. Offensively, the
Pioneers return RB Adam Wallace ‘03 and
an experienced front line will block for
Shawn Sigler '03, who has 9 career starts
and replaces the departed Jeff Pedersen.

Key Meet: @ St. Norbert, z-tirne defendr
ing MWC champ, Nov. 2

Men’s Cross Country

Last year: ch Champs

The skinny: Will Freeman’s fooisoldiers
continued their mastery of the Midwest
with their 15th tonfererice title in 15
years, and there’s no reason to believe
they can't do it again. Defending
individual Champ Adam Booth ’04 returns
and will be (la-captain with Matt Shamey
'03, Add to the mix one of the best
,incoming classes in Grinnell history, and
the rest of the conference has many
reasons to fear the Pioneers.
