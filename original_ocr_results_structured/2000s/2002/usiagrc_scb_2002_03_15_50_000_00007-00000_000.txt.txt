she typiully purs in ii ro
20 hours a week.

Boyd's sdiedule makes
ir difheiilr for her ro keep up. “I really don’t have have a lor
orrime ro srudy; lonel rhar] aifeers my perrorinonee in class,"
she said.

Her work sehediile has also our esrraeurrieuier attivle
ries our ofBoyds life. She had hoped ro run eross eounrry
ar Grinncll hur said she would have no rime for pderiees.

The only diings rhar I have rrme ro do are work rry so go:
some sleep, end srudy." she said.

And sleep is limired. “Usuellyl don’t manage mueh
sleep,” Boyd said, “Even ifl go ro bed or a deeenr hour.
in worried ahour whar I’m nor gerring done." Boyd said
she is lucky ro ger four or five hours ofsleep a nighr.

Boyd aeknowledges rhar Grinnell has helped her a lor
financially, olfering her a large gram. However, due ro her
unique finaneial siruarion, she also had ro rake our loans
and work long hours.

“lr's exrremely dimrulr for me ro pay ror eve
rhar Grinncll requires me ro pay for," Boyd said "I feel
rhar rhere's a lot more diar [Grinncll] eould have helped
me our with."

Boyd has been on her own, unsupporred by her par.
enrs, sinee she was 14 _ hur Grinnell looked or her par»
:nts' ineomes when assessing her need. “They rook inro
eonsideraeion my porenrs ineome level even rhough l did

Boyds experiences wirh people in rhe finaneial aid or.

like rhey really wanred ro help mes she said

Bur rheir eoneern wasn't enough ro improve Boyd's
fmaneial siruarion. “It was like someone up shove rhem

she said.

Boyd will rrarisfer nexr year for a numher ofreesons,

“better" finaneial aid paekage, she said, slong with a lower
eomprehensive tee.
