Admittedly fascinated by pain, Quellhorst sees
a link between hurting himself and his chosen
hobby

“I have a terrible tendency toward masochism,"
he said. “Anyone that knows me can tell you that."

Though he may take pleasure in the raw blis-
ter: and aching muscles that result from 26 miles
or running, Quellhorst finds little joy in the race
itsclﬁ It is in “getting it th: hell over with" dint he
finds gmtirrcation. “I enjoy the accomplishment at
the end," he explained, “I don't necessarily enjoy
the actual act,”

“Tall spikes are to s sloppy course as tailboys
are to a sloppy dninki essential."

These are the words ofAdilm Booth ‘04, who
ﬁnished ﬁrst out ora pool orover 300 runners last
week at the BK Pie»Nationals hosted by St. Olafin
Nanhﬁeld, Minnesota.The course that he and Ill:
rest ofGtinncll’s men's and women's crosSrcountry
team ran in was deﬁnitely sloppy. "We woke up to
rain Saturday morning," women’s head coach
Evelyn Freeman remarked “Theeoursewas muddy
before rho rams even started and by the time the
men got through with it and the women started, it
was in pretty bad shape."

The men did do some tearing up otrhc course
on Saturday. Booth led the way, posting a time or
25:59.00 against a ﬁ:ld ofﬂine top-25 teams and
many of the top individual runners in the nation,
This was good for a ﬁrst place ﬁnished and an.
other notch In the belt for Boothi

“He won convincingly in very diiricult condi-

tions," raid men’s head conch Will Freeman. “we
have been fortunate to have Adam leading the
squad. He will be one orihc favorites for the na.
tional title this year."

The rest ofthe men's ream did not fair as well
as Booth, however. Two of the team's top 10 run.
ners, including No. 3 runner Mart shnmey ‘03,
did not run at all because oriniuries and other ob.
ligations. Coach Freeman still felt the men had a
great group running and it would be a strong com-
petitive meet throughout,

lt wns i different story at the end orrhe mcc,
however. Freeman was happy to see Booth win,
but felt the room’s performance Wnn'l up to par
with the expectations the team had set. "Adan-l
showed today that he is r deﬁnite eonrender for
the national title. The team as a whole inn some.
what flat after a couple or hard training weeks. A
tough aeademie period also may have horn a cul.
prit." Justin Riley, ‘06, was another runner who
had s strong race tor the Pioneers. He placed 27..
ovendl in his first national race at the collegiate level.

As a term Grinnell plaeed 1 1m in the ﬁeld. 327
runners partieipated in the men's race thstwus won
by 2nd»ranked North Central College.

The women's team also had to deal with some
slower times because orthe courscconditions. They
were without their No. 1 runner, Nnomi Marsh
‘03, who was in ,urcd. so they knew going into the
nice that their mm seore would suitor. The women's
top ﬁnisher was Mary Parsons ‘05. who posted a

Sd1mirL ‘05. Stephanie Mclrady ‘03, KateMoreom
‘05, and Ursula Hill ‘05 rounded out the top ﬁve

for Grinnell. Grinnell ﬁnished last in a field of 22 .

reams, bnt this placing did not really reiioet the
team's skill level.

Along wiih the men's team, the women's cross.
country tmm is focusing on conference, coming
up after Fall Break on November 2. They used the
Pte»NiAtionals as a ﬁne-tuning for this very import
rant race on the 2nd.

“Right now we are starting the last phase or

our training known as h taper.” said Mclcady. “All
season we’ve had relrtively high mileage from as»
60 miles a week and we’v: been doing long inter.
valr. Now we are euning back on our mileage and
runnrng shorter raster intervals, The combination
orlower mileage and raster paced workouts should
make us speedier."

“The women are a solid. uniﬁed ream," Evelyn
Freeman remarked, “They have great work ethic
and our workouts hove been inspiring for me to

Both the mens and women's crosseountry
tenms look to place well at conrercnoe and NCAA
Regionals in mid—November. Their iinal woek of
competition before the big events will take place
Saturday, oct. 18 at the Lords 1nvirarional in
Dubuquc, IA. This will be another rice that will
not be a very large focus for either ream. Many
runners will be held back, and the teams will begin
preparing tor the final stretch of important No.
vember mces.
