quite depressing,

The Bourne Identity (PG-13)

Here's rlie Pitch: Co hunting Good Will I—Innong!

1: Matt Damon stars in this movie b1rsed on 1 Robert
Ltldlum novel, the hot in 1 planned trilogy otnlms. secret
agent Jason Bournc (Damon) is discovered ﬂoating in the
Mediterranean by 1 group oikiiidly ﬁshermen. He doesn‘t
remember what his name is, how he- might have gotten
into the middle ofrhe ocean in a high-tech wet suit. what
the secret code imphnlcd into his skin is to, or how 1 Se»
crei code got implanted into his irrekin’ skin in the First
placel

Getting hack to shore, Bourne begins piecing together
his identity, starting with ﬁnding 1 safety deposit box full
oicrazy cool spy ge1r (1nd loo 0' cash), successfully avoid»
ing ageno trying to kill him to cover the governments as,
and meeting the world’s ﬁrst
Boumc girl (Franka Potente, Run
[on Ron).

B: Theres 1 copy otrlus
ﬂoating around on
Resnct, but it's very
poor quality, See it at
l-larris. instead, I
missed it in the.
atres. so all I can
offer is the advice
of others. Care
B1rdelson, rumored
knitter and Read 1“ SA, has seen this “amazing movie" six
times. And Kevin smith, everyones favorite purveyor of
ﬁlthy movies, has this to say “Iffor no other reason, see it
to watch Matty (Damon) hen the livingshir out orpeople.
He comes offvcry Batman (comics Barmnii, not movie
Batmm)!‘

J: What makes The Baum: Merino work is the intelli-
gence, style, and Freshness brought to ordinary, genre ma.
terial. This is the kind of worthwhile action flick that makes
you wonder how the makers of worthless tripe like XXX
could even spell the title or their movie. let alone dress
themselves. Director Doug Limari (Swingers, Ga} brings o
brilliant, youthful flair to action sequences, at once avoid»
ing the prim Bond look and the ADD. MTV, chnmei
unfortunate look of most new action movies for our dc-
mogmphie.

J:To the credit ofthe movie.

the characters are remarkable

drawn and vividly portrayed

by quite an 1ccomplished

cast of actors. The dialogue

is snappy and thc scen1rios 1re brilliant. Plus, this movie

Features the only watchable scene ever filmed in a fast food
