Obstacle course

iiyou're fortunate enough to live in a dorm with a

advantage of those nice chairs for a little indoor spotting

wouldn't have wheels.

Those recyeling bins make great obstacles. Drag them
out of their niches and stagger them around the hallway
Then divide into teams oftwo: one person sits in the chair
while another pushes them down the hall at blukncck
speeds, trying not to hit anything.
