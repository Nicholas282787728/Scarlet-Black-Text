And ro some cirrenr, rhar seems ro be just whar direcror Rod

A complex tale of two love triangles

Bradley leaves Jeremy behind to review a French film classic, Le Reg/e du Jel/ or, The Rules of the Game

Columnist

trs Friday, and your weekends already packed. lfyou can man.
age ro cram some rime in bcrwecn drinking ronighr and romorrow,
and srudying on Sunday, ler me recommend to you a French movie
you've never heard of.

It's miled Le Regze do 1m, or, as anyone nor rrying ro sound pre.
[cnlious would call it, Th: lea/at af/lze Grime. It was made in 1939 by
Jean Renoir. rhe son orsome guy an Arr History mnior could roll you
all about.

The plors a joy ro warch, but a pain to plain. I'll do my besr:
Andre, z famed pilot, is obsessed with Chri nc, which upsets her
husband, the Marquis dc la Chesney. So much so, that the Malquis
tiles to sever tics wldi his mistress Octave is a mutual friend ofChris'c
tine nndAndrc, and has :lsmall ail-Fair with Christine’s Scrvunt, Liselte.
Liscrte’s husband, rhough is more ﬂusrered wirh her ﬂing wirh Marceu,
a lowly poacher. Basically, us a complex rate ofa rwo love triangles
rhar tum inro orher shapes. Trusr me, I aced geomerry.

You've never heard or rhe movie, and sure enough, you don'r
know rhe casr. Acrually. Marcel Dalio, who plays rhe Marquis, had a
bit pair as rhe croupier in Carib/(mm. Being shorr and rather ugly, he
doesn't looklikc a marquis, but is excellent as a wealthy man with too
many hobbies to have clear priorities. Renoir plays Octave, a failure
or all he's anempred. t-ie deriiiirely is rhe mosr syinparheric characrer,
and holds rho picrure rogerher, The mosr inrriguing casring choice is

Like most ﬁlms prior to rhe rechnical advances in Orson Welles’

simple and hid backi Renoir conﬁdently uses long rakes, shining rhe

Renoir’s name, 1’“ just posir that irrisric ability runs in his Family

The inrrodiicrion ro rhe min reads, “This film is inrended ns
enrerrainmenr nor socul criricism," bur rhnr's a lie. Throughour, ir
scrurini-ies rho socieral rules otrelorionships, which sire dependonr on
class. Chrisrine, Andre, and especially rhc Marquis belong re s higher
socisl srrsrum, and have more idle rime ro her over romsnces, yer sie
required to keep rheir emorions In dieck. Andie is consrsnrly chirled

Because of irs somewhar harsh criricism of French sociery, ir
