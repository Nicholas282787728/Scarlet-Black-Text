On September 19, three Gtirincll Alumni Found
themselves in the middle of an attempted coup dent
in the ivory Coast. Jennifer Hendlcy ‘01, Sharyn Roilth
‘01, and Lillian Benjamin ‘01 were serving, along with
130 other volunteers, in the Peace Corps when the up»
rising occurred. All volunteers are now safe and have
been consolidated in Accra, Ghana.

History

The nrrcmprcd soup is the rotulr orrisurg tensions,
which bcgan in 1999 after a popular presidential candi-
date, Alassanc Ouattnrn, was disqualiﬁed from the clot}
tions because of his nationality. To have ststus us nu
Ivorian citizen, all ofoue’s direct dcscendents must have
been born in the Ivory Coast. Personal documents of
Ouattara’s datingback to 1962 have indicated his mother
was born in Burkiiia Faso.

The election winner, Laurent Gbagbo, has since
given much aid to the southern purrorrhe ivory Coast.
deepening the geographical split in the nations [6 mil-
lion Inhibitanls between the Muslim North (who sup-
port Ouartaral and mostly christian south (who sup.
port ohagho).

“There are many people who feel he does not look
after the needs of the country as a whole, but rather,
[those of] his political parry m (Front Populsire
Ivorian) and the southern half of the country." said
Headlcy, Benjamin, and Routli.

it appears that the rebels who arrcmprcd the coup
are from the northern part of the country. which has
long complained ordiscrimination from Southerners.

“When it all started, . . . it seemed as if the rebels
were just soldiers upset about being defected from rhc
army," said Headley, Benjamin, and Routh. “Now, it
seems as it they are anti»Gbagbo . . . and righting for
free elections as well as a government that it leprestnta»
live or people [otmrious ethniciticsl."

Since the attempted coup, the rebels. whose fund-
ing and motives rcmain somewhat unclear, have murv
dered approxrmately 300 civilians, and there seems to
be little hope for an immediate resolution.

The Uprising

At the time otrhc uprising, Headlcy was located in
the village of Dediaﬂa, which is at the border of the
North/south divide. Most of the people in the village

arc Southern sympathizcrs and belong to the PM party,

Though Headley heard about the uprising on her
shortwave (than: are no phones or electricity in
Dediaﬂa), the villagc remained calm and safe, and she
united there to hear more news.

"Five or six dayt into the uprising, I received two
written massages asking me to contacr the Peace Corps
omcc," Headley said. “I was aisle to ﬁnd transporr to
another town to call into [the capital] Abidjan. [where]
l was told to consolidate to Daloa, my regional city.
Once there, i met up with rwo other volunteers, and we
were told to continue onto Abidjan."

From Ahidjan. the volunteers were able to move just
across the border into Ghana and ovontually into Accra
where they now remain.

Because the rebels had taken
over many parts or the country al-
ready it was difﬁcult to travel.

"Gas had horn cutoff and was
getting hard to ﬁnd, so wcwcrc lucky
to ﬁnd rransporr." Headlcy said

Benjamin, who had traveled Lhe
day before to Bouakc to reﬁll hcrgas
horrlc. awoke to gunﬁre and a call
from the Pence Corp: securityomce
rclliughtr that there had been an at-

temptcd coup d’ctat.
Bouake is the second
largosr city in the Ivory
Coast and was one orrhc
ﬁrst to be taken over by tho rehth. For the next
eight days, Benjamin and eight other volunteers
romainedcaprive in die regional housoin Bouakc.
“We were able to hear the gunﬁre and heavy
artillery around us," said Benjamin. “We wcrc told
to lac ready to he evacuated at any moment."

Water and cellular service were cur while they were
rhcrt. They wore this to go into the city daily to get

food. water, and supplies. and they hnd conmcr with
many people in the city.

"We \vcrc able to talk to some otrhc rebels and
many or the regular citizens or Bourke." Bone
jarnin said. “The people thatI talked [to] donor

want this ror their country. Thcyalc awareotwhnt
the consequences would be, and (ht: majority or
the people want peace "

Finally, Benjamin got a call from the Peace Corps
saying the rebels had agreed to a 48-hour cease—rite and
she would be evacuated that arrcrnoon. Missionary cone
voys drove her and the other voiunrcorr to Yarnoutsouluo.
where the us. military met them. They were then placed

Routh was located in Djedjeopaitgnoa, which is in

the south otthc country and not far from the village of
President Gbagbo, where nearly all orrhevillagcrr heavily
support the m. Dcspite the news, life did not change
much in thevillngc in the days following the attempted
coup.

“A few days arrer the initial news otthc uprising I went
into the ncarhy crryofcagnoaro phone my paronc," Routh
said. “My rrgiorr had not hton vitihly airccted hywharwns
going on in other parts orthc country."

Though lire did not change much in the village felt

the village were consolidatcd to Ghana heoaurt the peace
Corps wsnrcd to ensure the saicry ofall volunteers,

“I stayed at a friend's house in [Cagnoni tor a few
days until the other volunteers
from the region werc consolidated
to Gagnoa." she said. “Then we all
traveled togsrhcr to Abidjan and
then on to Accra.”

Their Service
Bcrorc the coup, the three
alumni were involved in several clif-
rcrtnt projects in their respective lot
carions across the ivory Coast.
Benjamin was working on a
public latrines project for her
village's mnrkor as well as weigh-
ing babies at a hcalrh center,
Routh was continuing work on a school latrinc
project in two dirrerent villages. She was also working
closely with the community health agents orscvcn vil—

when she was forced to leave her village. She was a “ﬁrst
generation" volunteer, meaning tlrnr she was the ﬁrsr
volunteer ever at that site.

Co ncl usion

On Oct. 2, the Peace Corps Ivory Coast program
was suspended, leaving Hendlcy, Benjamin, and Routh
with several options: transferring to another country;
waiting to see ifl’cacc Corps Cote d’lvoire is reopened
after several months; starring the application process over
again tor another Country: or taking a cos (close of
service) and returning to the States. None have decided
yet what they plan to do.
