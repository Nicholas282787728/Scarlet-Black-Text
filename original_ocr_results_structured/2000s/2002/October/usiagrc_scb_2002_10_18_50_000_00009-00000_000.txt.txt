Smkrng or swrmmmg In college

Everyone knows thatyou can’tjustjumpinto a swim-
ming pool without thinking. You ﬁrst have to be able
to swim, If that seems like a straightfowvard statement,
think about this one: does high school prepare stu—
dents to "swim” in college?

Ido not think so. I rarely wrote papers because my
teachers didnt like grading them I took open note»

‘ book midterm: and ﬁnals or simply none at all. The

classes required only a little effort and intelligence. In
the "difﬁcult” classes, earning good grades meant re~
gurgitating information provided by the teachers. We
rarely thought about what we learned.

Then I come here to Grinnell, where suddenly prev
fessors want me to draw my own conclusions, plan ex-
periments on my own, and think for myself. It was a
shock. Why don’t high schools prepare us for college?

Crazy lines for Cowles food

Ishould be used to waiting in line at Cowles. My
friends and Iwait ten minutes to get into the dining
hall, and then wait for another couple minutes just
to get ourtray and plate. After that we battle through
the crowds to get salad, soup or to use the micro—
waver Recently, there have been incredible lines just
to get ICE! I could handle those annoyances of Cowles,
But now, after we spend twenty minutes just getting
to the point where we could sit down and eat, Cowles
has gotten to the point where you can’t even ﬁnd a
place to sit. During Mondays dinner, my Friends and I
prowled around Cowles for ten more minutes just to
ﬁnd a few stray chairs. I just want a quick, easy,
painless meal. I’m not even asking that it is good.

On order and entropy

Are you the One? Or the zero? I ask you, All actions
are somewhere on a scale of zero to One, Zero means
you are purely contributing to entropy; One is ecstatic
order, By reading this, you are closer to the One. When
you’re crying alone, zero When you talk to someone:
One, depending on the eonversation. Playing with
building blocks: One. You have cmshed something,
spent the subtlety of a life on a moment’s sad bluster:
Zero. Here is the equation for our being: MV/r - p
Mass times velocity divided by distance equals
potential. The atoms that compose our souls—heating
against one another, darning and knitting, the skeins
patterning into thoughu... We are the sum of our
actions—our interactions. We create ourselves. Sartre
said that. don’t laugh, it is sort of funny though—
we're alive! Zero or One? ,
