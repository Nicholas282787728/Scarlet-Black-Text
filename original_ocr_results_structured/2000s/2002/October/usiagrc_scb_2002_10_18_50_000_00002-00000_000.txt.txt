Two delegations of Grinnell’s QUIZ BOWL TEAM placed
third and fourth, respectively, in their ﬁrst tournament
of the year at Iowa State University last Saturday.
Grinnell’s B team fared poorly in round-robin play, but
their unexpectedly meteoric rise in the last four games
led to a ﬁnal match against their teammates for the
third place title. Arteam captain Steve Ford ’05 took
home two indivrdual awards from the ﬁeld of over 40
students: a third-place score for points earned, and a
ﬁrsteplace score tor the most incorrect answers . . .
Members of the ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION GROUPjoined
Cowles’s TBD line last Wednesday in an effort to assess
the amount of organic waste that would be reused in a
possible composting system at the new dining facilities
in the Campus Center. The day’s three meals generated
a combined 375 pounds of potential compost, ranging
from an average 9.18 pounds per breakfast-goer to 0.38
pounds per dinner-goer.

A new BLACKBOARD DISCUSSION ON STRATEGIC
PLANNING, which aims to solicit campus opinion about
the college’s long-term goals, will be the ﬁrst such board
to allow users to post their opinions anonymously.
Administrators of past discussions had interpreted
anonymous postings as violations of the self-governance
requirement that students "take ownership for
actions, opinions, and beliefs," Strategic Planning
Committee Chair Mark Montgomery, Economics, who
helps administer the board, said that since non-students

would be involved in this discussion, special
considerations were necessary, "When you're dealing with
start and you’re dealing with faculty whose jobs are
untenured, theirjobs are on the line, and they may be
hesitant to speak out," he said. ”I would rather err on
the side ot making it easier for people to speak their
minds, in this particular case," . . . SATELLITE VOTING
drew 125 Grinnellians to the Forum South Lounge on
Wednesday, 20 days before the November 5 election,
National news outlets reported this week that up to 15
percent of us. voters may cast their ballots early this'
year . . Seven of Grinnell’s nine remaining CAMPUS
BIKES had been broken by Monday. Craig Cooper, the
owner of Bikes to Vou, should have them allln working
order by the time Students return from fall break, but
Student Services Coordinator Christina Doxsie '03 said
that SGA was unlikely to pay ror further repairs it the
bikes are damaged again.

corrections

Last week’s 5&3 misidentiﬁed the subject of its front-
page photograph. Darin Cook, not Phil Nelson, ﬁelded
most of the questions at last week’s open forum on
CAMPUS CENTER CONSTRUCTION. . . A separate article
on the open FORUM WITH GRINNELL’S TRUSTEES
contained two inaccuracies: the student who asked the
trustees to aim for ”bronze level or above lEED
certiﬁcation" in construction or new campus buildings
was Avrarn Lyon ’06, not Eli Zigas ’06. In fact, LEED’s
system of environmental standards no longer stratines
clients into ”gold," ”silver," and "bronze” levels . . . An
article on the possible expansion of GRINNELL’S CINEMA
THEATER incorrectly referred to its owner, the Fridley
Theatre Corporation, as the ”Fidley Theater Corporation”
. Grinnell High School’s HOMECOMING PARADE was
on Thursday night, not Friday, as reported last week.

The 5&3 regrets these errors.
