SGA Vice President-elect Devan Mchmlmn ’04 says
s adnrrnrsrrarion will continue pushing for true
like the proposed tuition gr. ice, but the tone

“Our adminrsrrarion maybe signiﬁcantly different in
its dealings with college administrators than the current
adiiunlstrntion," McGr ahan said. “1 cxpcct [Prt‘sldcnir
elecri rueiyandro Oyzirmbnl '04] and i to be a little less
combative and a lrtrle more appreciative uiconrpromise "

O Inbal and McGraiiahan plan to meet with some
administrators this spring in order to start for ming friendly
relationships before they take office.

i MeGianahali said
he hopes to avoidsiru.
ations like the one’thai
oecurled last semester
when Dining Services
director Dick \Vill»
iams spoke to a Mon-
day night session of
SGA Joint Board.
“That inst turned into
a lot orienting at Dining Services and Diet Williams pmc

rally, and i think there were more professional ways or
randlrng it," he said

McGranahan cited the way rhe ciirrenr administration
have been handling the iecent debate nvei luitinn lnClEMES
it the kind ofelemplc he plans to follow, Student lcrdcrs
are in the process ofcollecting student opinions and ills!»
hand accounts of ﬁnancial problems in a written packet
and “submitting it in a piofctsronal manner, instead ofiutr
bringing people in and grilling them like oicle Williams
was [gtllled]."

At the same time, McGrﬂnﬂthl said, ‘vaeii though
we’re not going to rush into a room and make demands
that doesn't mean we’re going to be weak e nu e budding
to administrative resistance to something students want to
see happen,"

McGrairahan has been easing into his job by attending
meetings of the college curriculum eomrnitrec with the
current V'P/PAA, Gabe Rosenberg '03.

The curriculum committee has to sign orion all pro
posed changes to the curriculum. At one meeting
McCranahan attended, the psychology department pre.
sented its plans for next year's courses. “The choices this
commirtcc makes. In this case. will affect anyone who srarrs
into the pwch department" next year, he said

once the school year gers underway, McGlanahnn said
he plans to pursue the possibility ofcxpariding the science
division’s mentoring program into other academic departs
merits. Noting that the curriculum committee has referred
back to a sunrcy Rosenberg conducted about Mentored

Adimnced Projects, he said he will work on a survey to
determine whether expanding the mentoring program
would be useful,

Though McGranahans future plans involve mentoring
for college classes, he has devoted much of this year to
meirrorrng students at Grinnell Middle school rhrough a
program designed to help children who seem likely to drop
out orsehool.

McGtanahzn’s other focus outside ofschool is running
forGtinnell’s track and cross country teams. He’s been ham»
pared by injuries. he said, but “for me, the most lmponant
part has been thecamaraderie ofiti"

in a way running is the reason MeGi-anahan got into
SGA in the first place. After getting an email urging stu.
dcnrs to run for Joint Board, be asked a few ordre crane
country captains ifhc should run. “They said, ‘Yeah, that's
a good thing ro do, youd be good at dare.” he recalled. "So
i ran, and i won iwas sold on it immediately."

Argentine
underdog

by Whitney Carr
Staff Writer

on March 12, election day, Alejandro Oyareabal ’04 stopped
by every open door he could find from Main ro Norris. Then he
repeated the trip. Two and a halfmore times.

After holding only 265 votes to Katie Pieper‘s doc ehcr the
first round ofvorrrrg, oyanabal was the underdog or the SGA
presidential race. Loving a challenge, the knowledge that he was
an underdog only increased his enjoyment of the campaign,
Oyanabal estimated that he campaigned for 30 hours during clec.
tion week, 10 ofthose hours solely on election day. The dooreto-
door canrpaign worked: Oyai-rabal slipped ahead orrieper by nine
votes to Win the election.

Feeling like the rrndcrdoguas nor a new sensation foroyariabal.
His family left Argentina when he was four to move to Iowa. He
remembers having choppy
English in elementary
school, and not feeling truly
comfortable with his new
culture until he reached third
grade. Even once the lane
guagc and culture were fa»
miliar to him, he often felt
lilre he was constantly “on:
step behind" everyone else. He felt pmsure to assert himself. “[There
were] opportunities there (but I] never fclr they ever opened up to
me,” said Oyttnabal. “There was always some hill to climb "

Oyambal admitted that his perception ofa “hill to climb” was
based more on intuition than feeling like a victim of mcism. He
stressed that the two communities he’s lived in, Ame: and Des
Moines, are “very tame, very accepting" places. While his parents
encouraged his accomplishments, Oyambal's drive to tackle ch11»
lenges and be a leader were selhrmposcd. “I always forced myself
into the spotlight," he said. “I felt like [in order to gain a leadership
role] 1 had to push harder [than others]."

Oynnabal was forced to htinc his leadership skills early in life.
By the time he was five he was translating for his Argentine parents,
who knew some English but weren't comfortable with the language
until years later. spcaldng for his parents didn't phase him at ﬁve bemusc, as the oldest
child, he was already accustomed to speaking for his little brother. Though he had no
difficuhy with translating the language to his parents, he did encounter some problems
translating the culture to them. Situations like accompanying 2 friend on vamtion bewila
dered his parenrs, but they encouraged him to participate in alemeriian activities like
Boy scours and marching band.

Despite their positive feelings about moving to the 11.5., his parents were relucont to
give up theirArgentmc citizenship. The Oyanabals only recently applied to be American
citizens. While Ombal admitted that he identiﬁes more with America, on a “basic
lev " he is more Argentine. He admin though that while he understands the “essence” of
Argentine oilnrre, the only Argentina he knows is the one his family lcrt sixteen years ago.

As a Des Moinss resident. Oyambal was aware of Grinnell when applying to col-
leges, bur it was his father who encouraged him to consider crinnell seriously. From
recommending boolo to acting as a role model. Oyzmbal’s father has been very inﬂuen-
tial in shaping who he would like to become. “[Looking it my dad] I‘ve learned what
character traits I want to keep and fit to my owrr personality." he said.
