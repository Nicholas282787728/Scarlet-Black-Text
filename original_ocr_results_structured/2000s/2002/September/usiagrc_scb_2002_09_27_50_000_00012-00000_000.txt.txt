Wasting energy

For a campus rhar prides melt in being so liberal, I’m surprised by
how often rhar ir comes orrsounrling eomplerely reaeuonary lnStL‘Jd.
1n rhe pasr rwo issues or rhe 5&3, every orher page eonrained a hatch
line about somesorr orehange on campus rhar is somehow eompierely
unaeeeprable. They ehanged rho paper in die eompurei- labsl They're
changing rhe number orocco housesl They changed the eigarerre
sales polieyar BobslThey rlianged rhe number othours die PEchight
room is open, and now somesrudenrs have re ehange rheir workaour
sehedulesl They're going to be changing rhe dining halls evenrualiy,
and the arriele wrirren about ir did nor siimeienrly eonvey rhe level or
srudenr dissatisr‘aerionl

And yer, amidsr all rhe big
headlines orrlae things rhar rhe ad.
minisrrarion is ehanging and rhe
srudenrs are eranky abour, rhere are
omerehaugesgoingon quierlyrhar
rho srudenrs don'r seem to mind.
Ar rhe very borrom of “campus

wirh no pubiie ourery, is the an.

wanr ro abandon a rradirion like that? Or: do any eurrenr srudenrs
have any idea what dae campus relays were> Probably nor many, sinee
I don't rhink rhey've been held sinee spring or 1998,

Ir just seems sad rlaar so mueh energy is being wasred raising a hue

Concerned juniors and seniors

Kindly go stuffyourselves and your lessons on Quad
dining. We ought to embrace Quad line formations as a
beautiful and anarchic natural function-as gift giv ri
to us by architecture. Your desecration orthis rare, cri
cal exhibition oi the chaos of social spontaneity with
ﬁscism insuls the fundamental freedom we cherish as
Grinnell students and as human beings. Maybe when
the weather cools the line will naturally divert into Main.
Perhaps, instead, the system prefers the loggia and the
cold is a natural method of keeping the wait brief. Ima
posing your social control on what is clearly a self-
organizing system, with specious and pseudo-scientiﬁc
”evolution” as support, destroys its fragile harmony. In
short: if you want the line to go your way, get there at
the critical moment orshut up We have our whole lives
yet to stand in deterministic lines. V

Further instructions

And about the Stirling graffiti:

You want to comment on someone eke's statement.
To relate your new statement to the existing one, you
draw an arrow.

BUT REMEMBEhi The arrows don't point from your
new grafﬁti to the old piece you’re commenting upon.
They lead from the old piece of grafﬁti to yours. This is
because the Burling bathrooms are evolving works of
art with shared authorship. The pbjeclifying “at”aara
row, like Medusa’s gaze, degrades object and subject
alike, paralyzing the one and alienating the other. The
gentle "frorn"-arrow, by contrast, serves as a guide, not
an adversary: instead of directly attacking the work of
a rival artist, and conﬁning debate within the petty
barriers of context, it directly engages the audience in
the ongoing process of creation.

“If you choose," says the "from”aarrow, ”g lance this
way."
