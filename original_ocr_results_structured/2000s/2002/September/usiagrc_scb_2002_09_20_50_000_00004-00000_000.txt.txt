That’s whatAthcLic Director Dec Fairchild says about rhc change:
in rhe rec rhis yar. “It’s nor abour me budget, it’s about making
everyrhing rnore emeienr," she said,

For most students, the most vislble changes in the PEG involve
rhe weighr room’s ayailalsiliry. The weight rooms hours ofopererion
have been on by 3.5 hours aday. Unlike rhe previous schedule, 7am.
ro 10 p.m., rhe weight room now serves srudenrs and heulry from 7
ro 9am, and ll:30a.m.ro 3pm.

The cur hours are historlully rirnes in which she weighr mom
does norexperienee mueh rrarhc, based on “sign—in sheer and visual"
information, according ro Feirehild.

lnrorrned char rnany sendenrs ignore rhe sign-in sheer upon env
rering d-ie weight room, Fairchild said. “It's a possibiliry, but [Assis
uni Football and Truck Coadi] Dan Immekcr's ofﬁce is there If

people donk sign In, we don'r know who’s rhere.”

While some crudenrs are unaffected by rhe new weight room
schedule, odiers rnusr adapt rheirsehedules ro ﬁr rhe new hours, “Ir'll
rake some nrne ro get used ro dress ehanges," said Ellen Gibson ‘05.

in addirion ro rhe weighr roomsehedule changes, rhe recs work.
sruely hours are reduced. In correspondence wirh rhe new weight
room hours, rveighr roorn rnonirors now work 245 fewer hours per
week, PEC rnonirors arc aireered as well, in rhe past, rwo srudenrs
monirored rhe rec at a given rrme, one on eaeh level. One srudene
are rime now serves as sole mac rnoniror. “we feel that one [moni-
ror] oan handle rhe work of two," said l-‘airehrld.

Some srudenr workers expressed rrusrranon wirh rhis deeresse in
working hours “1 rhink ir is ridiculous rhar rhey cur so many hours
that srudenrs Can work," said Man Dank ’05. “Many [srudenr sreri
members] welked our when [rhe adminisrrarors or me PEC] rold us
how many hours rhey would out. Now some people who wanr ro use
rhe reerliries will find ir more difficult ro rind e rnoniror."

Fullrrime srerremployrnenr eondirions have changed in addnion
ro srudenr ones. Roger Kendall, rhePEC's Equipment Managerslncc

shsenoe, Fairehrld refused ro eomrnenr.

siill, Fairchild mainreins that any ehangu in rhe rec are unrer

Fairchlld exprrssed hope that PEC changes will serve srudenrs'
