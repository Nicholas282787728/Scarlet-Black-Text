Thar rhyrhiri was deﬁnitely iaeking iasr sarurday when Grinn=ll

a big put ofthcir season, and that Ripun, m—mnfcmnce champions

“This is a must-win for us," said defensive lineman Mark Pituch
’06 before ri-ie game. “They’re a grear ream, bur I know we can play
with them,"

“Ripon is one of our biggesr rivais and rhey know it," added

Aiiroirio Harrison '05. “Theysrep oirihe bus with a swagger, a siing.
