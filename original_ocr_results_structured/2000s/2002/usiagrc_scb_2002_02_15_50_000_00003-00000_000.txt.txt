College changes off-campus tuition fees

Students will now pay at least Grinnell tuition no matter the price tag on the program

by Kate Mannion
Staff Writer

Last week, smdenrs who wished to study off. .oampus next year turned
in their appliearions for college approval to study abroad While nothing
has elianged about rhe appliearion proeeas ro study abroad there has been
a ehange in policy for paying tuition to olr. .eampus study programs- Stu»
dams who plan to go abroad near year will have to pay Grinnell tuition for
their oftoampus study program, regardless orwhar program they apply
to, even ifrhar program would have been less eapen.
sive.

This change in policy was first considered two
years ago by the Board orTrrsrees. Dean Jim swam
said that in reviewing the college's budget, dich'ust—
e6 norieed "rhe way [rhe oollege] handled OFF-mm-
pus srudywasvery unusual among orher institutions,
and it made a variety ofaspece of[r.he college’s] bud.
ger really hard to compare to other institutions.'

Swarlz said rharsruolenrs applying to study abroad
had also found fault in the past ﬁnancial aid system,
heeause rhey had to apply for financial aid through
whatever program theywere applying to. swans agrees
that the old way or applying for oliteampus study
ﬁnancial aidwas “very eonr’using" for students, and is
conﬁdent rhat under the new policy, the application
process will be simplerand more straightforward

Under the new policy, rhe eollege eherges Grinnell tuition for all off»
campus study programs whose ruirions are equal to or less expensive than
Grinnell’ s tuition fee. The college in turn calculates the studcnr’s ﬁnancial
aid, and pays that students ofﬁumpus study program directly. This al—
lows rhe eollege to figure living expenses, such as housing and tnnspurme
tion, into the student's overall financial aid package.

”[The college is] paying
substantially more in fees
for students to attend pro-
grams than students are
paying to Grinnell, so our
off<campus study program
really costs Grinnell quite
a bit of money to maintain.”

“The whole polieywassortoflumped up to make

there," swaro said.

While the new poliey may make the hnaneial
aid appliution process easier. the policy's impact on

is, but decide to make it hnaneially more difﬁcult for people who wanr to

Faces of
death row

Grinnell-sponsored summer
internship in Chicago to work with
a ‘92 alumna on death penalty

As an example or this use, Peterson talked about a
man namedWlll. who was found guilryorniurder Peterson
discussed attending the scntenclng itself, emphasizing the
“emotionalintensity.” Her role or die senteneing was mostly
to talk to witnesses and spend time with Will’s family.
Through talking to Will and his relatives, Peterson learned
lhe story of his life, including childhood abuse. and :pi»
sodas of paranoia he experienced prior to committing the
murder. Will was sentenced to the death penalty

She then asked Will if he would like to tell people any.
thing and he said “Hey. fight injusriee, recognize the bias
in the system and the nae in the system and if [I] was
White, this wouldn't have happened,"

The third use Peterson discussed was that of a man
named Max, who was the first person she met on death
row. in this case, mitigation was being used for Mass apa
peal. peterson described the process orenrering the prison
rhrough five or sit padded doors, being searched. and he
nally sitting with an unhandeuifed Max in asmall cafetc»
ria. Max, Peterson said, had been on dearh row since 1988
and “reminded me
of a child."
Peterson explained
that she and Tatclli
had four months to
try to put togcrher
a case for Max's apt
peal. peterson held
up a sraek of paper
about four inches
thick as a demon

The mitigatel’sjob is not
to excuse the defendant’s
responsibility or say the
crime didn’t happen, but
to "put a face on the per-
son and say they deserve

err—anon of [he «5. to live " Peterson sal

nal product." At _—
one point in their information-gathering plocus, Peterson
and Tarelli drove ﬁve hours in rhe middle ofthe night to
talk to the neighbors Max had had m a child. Like many or
their mes, the outcome for Max's appeal is still unknown,
said Peterson. There is the possibility that he would only
free a life sentence.

The roorrh and ﬁnal phase in whieh mirigarion ran be
used is in aclemeney petition, Peterson deseribed thcclem»
ency petition and eventual execution of a man named
Jerome. she described her main role as support and “me-
dia work, trying to get interviews." As it turned our, both
Jeromes sister and the wife of rhe man he had killed were
named “Sarah." The wife of the state trooper wanted an
apology from Jerome's family. Although Tarelli tried to art
range a meeting or the two Sarahs, it didn't happen. The
meetingwould have been an attempt 2! what Peterson railed
"restorative jusriee." As Peterson explained, “The victims
are often left out ofthe ireriee system." The idea or miter»
atiye justice is to “let oirenders know [yictirns'] needs and
let rhe offender rake responsibility.” Often, Peterson said,
rhe victim's family isn't looking for the death penalty.

getting the person to an okay place in their own head."
Tarelli added rhar Will said, after his sentencing, "Now

Reneering on Peterson’s talk afterwards, Toteili said, "I
hope rhar these people came a little bit alive tonight . . .
