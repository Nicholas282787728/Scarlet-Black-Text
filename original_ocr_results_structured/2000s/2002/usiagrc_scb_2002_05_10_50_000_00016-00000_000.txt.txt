Negative changes

To she Edisors orshc scarier dis/om

As I prepare so graduase and leave Grinncll, I'm saddened by
many orshe changes shas are raising place on daiscarnpus. Irs pasrly
scnior nossalgia. bus slias isn’s diconly reason. Besweera she inrroduc.
sion orrhc monssrouslyinconvcniens P-Card, she conssrucsion ofan
csssraneous welcome senses. and die rcccns announcemens shas more
compuser labs will be loss, is seems so me shas moss orshe changes
raising place are achcsing ssudcnss nemsively. In my humble opin.
ion. diass nos she way shings should be.

I wish shas she presidcns, she srussccs, esc., would shwarr rhc selfc
serving acsions oradminissmsors and campus ofﬁces. Is seems shas
many ofshcrr policio are designed so soueesc every eens possible our
ofrhc ssudcnss. Moss orshesc policies, such as rcouiremsnss so live
on mmpus and be on a board plan unless given special permission,
are nos complcscly uniussiﬁed, Bur iss obvious so everyone shas shcre
is no valid reason so ges rid or she eompuser labs. Thcy’n: already
overﬂowing wish irazsled scholars as I wrrse shis.

Bur or course she labs will be removed, because shere is more
moneyin is for ITS adminissrasors irssudenss are roroed so buy come
pusers ﬁom shc mllcgc,

Sol aslsyou, People in Charge, weren'ssome shrngs good enough
she way shey werc.> And ireveryshing has so be changing conssausly,
why can’s she changes be besscr for she smdcnu? Could we have
besscrdeslss and air condisioning in all she dorms? 1 could go on
and on, bus I’ll be gone in rwo wselcs, so whas does is mauer?

Dear Editor, 4

When I came so Crinnell in 1997 on a subssansial scholarship,
mycompusercsspcricnccwas misedsopubliclibraryelecsro'nicesrd

program, l ryped all ormy college applicasion essays on a manual
sypcwrirer.

The season for my laels orcompuser cxpcrlcncc was primarily
ﬁnancial. Iwas home-schooled by “If-employed parcnss in a rural
locasion. My rarnily could nos aﬁosd a reliable car, les alone a com.
purer Is was diiﬁculs for us so malsc our wccldy excursion; so she
closcss public library (is miles away), inconceivable for us so enroll
in eompuser sraining classes as a seehnreal college equally rar away.

1 lsnew lwould have so learn abous compusers as Grinnell burl
paniclsed on she ﬁrss day of class when my susorial prorcssor, John
Mohan, assigned a paper for she next day, I could wrise a drais by
hand, bus who would show me how so sypo my paper before my

new friends see iusr how lissle l kncw. l decided so mcsswish Mohan
she ncss arscrnoon and sell him abous niy inabilrry and she reasons
ror is, I asked in could give him a handwrrsscn copy or my ﬁrss
paper. He loolced as me wish a befuddled expression and nodded his
asscns, He seemed more worried abous my general wellbeing as
Crinnell shan abous his assignmcns and poinscd our shas 1 really
muss learn how so use compusers as soon as possible. I prornrsed so
lcarn before my ncvs assignmens and iled his oilicc so ﬁnish a near,

handrprinsed draft of his paper before 5:00 shas day

Now I aim an MFA, srlldcnl all Ihc Unlvcrsir)‘ of \Vlicolhllk

even cdised a video ass piece l orseu round snyscli helping nus in

social enough so allow my rricuds so make nry lessons less painrul. l
also needed a place shas ssaysd open all nrghs because is soole me a

Dorm compuscr labs rcm insd csscnsial so my life as Criniiell

posed Grinncll assracss and admiss many lsiuds cfsmdcnrsa Many
lack composers and some lacls basic eompuser knowledge. Moss or
shcsc ssudcnss casinos afford compusers. When 1 was a Crinnell ssu—
deiir, many lsinds or ssudcnss could assend Crinnell and succccd.
Had compusers been mandasory, I would nos have even applied so
Grinncu. My dseision hinged on as little as she $500 more Griunell
offered me in ﬁnancial aid shan she oshcr schools I applied so.

Irpublrc oompuscrs remain diliiculs so access and personal coma
puscrs become mandasory, I will nos recommend shas any kind of

sidering how much I beneﬁrcd from my classes wish Mohan and

Dear Edisor,

Bill Francis, direcsnr of ITS, suggesss shas compusers have
dropped in coss; unforsunascly, is will be scvesal years before shey
become affordable so moss ssudcnss, In slreory, a decens lapsop
can be boughs for abous $900, or a dcslesop for 3600; howcver,
shesc machines conic wishous princess, reliable word processing

orbuying a lapsop easily comes so $1,500, a sall order on sop of

Speak out against
ITS changes

Two weclcs ago as Joins Board. as much of she campus has ale
ready been made aware, Bill Francis and John l<allsbrenncr announced
plans so eliminase slrc YMCA and Helpdcsls from she YMRC by
ness (all, so salsc over Norris compuser lab as she ﬁssure home or
Helpdesls, so ehmmase Cleveland eompuser lab for ssudens housing.
and so double RcsNesTl bandwidsh. As Kallsbrenncr oversees ITS
and Dining services, shcre is also discussion orsalsing over Younkcr
pis lounge (and nearby eompuser lab?) so house she new compressed
Lsprcss.

All orshis is being done wishous creasing more ssudens (ampul-
ing space on mmpus (bemusc prcscnsly sherc iuss isn'r any space—
dorms are already overcrowded and due so consrsucsion, rrec spaces
have been absorbed by displaced campus ofﬁces—bus is is clear shas
shey do nos plan so crease new labs when space becomes available),
wishous planning dorm eompuser labs inso she new Eass Campus
dorms, by reallocasing compusers shas ssudcnss are already using, nos
by upgrading so nerves machinavnll because ResNes is so damn
popular.

These changes are being made as she salcc ol‘all campus lab users
(which includes a number ofResNes users who own sherr own com-
pusers). all ssudcnss who prins so campus prinscrs (including sliosc
who prins irosn ResNes), all ssudcnss who need speeialiscdsoirware
{or academic purposes ((hcrc are no plans so lseyserve shis soﬁware
for use via ResNes), all ssudcnss who do nor compose in she science
building (Francis consinually erred she number orlabs available in
science), all ssudcnss who sypc papcrs when she IIF, Burling. and
Inslab are closed, ssudcnss who work on group projeess, and all ssu.
dcurs and Faorlsy needing eompuser resources heroic and during exam
wcelc, rvhcn usage is as in highsss.

To many, shis seems a plan so enforc: mandasoryconrpuserownr
ership on campus (Francis is already encouraging ssudenss so “bring
a compuses" ifrhc labs are crowded), movc closer soward she ever
hased lapsop proposal, and, as rss moss basic, pir ssudcnss wish re.
sources (shose who can airord so bringacompuscr so campus) againss
ssudcnss wishous shem.

Bill Francis argued shas hc doesn'e see compusers being used when
he checlss labs osi campus. Any lab user could (and many sried so as
113) sclI Francis shas shis impression is nrissalscn, and perhaps rccouns

Gchomp when is was simc so bcgin ﬁnal paper #5 or ﬁnrsh shas bro

ITS is clearly moving away from suppers of lab compusi rig be
cause of she popularisy or Rcchs. However, 1 reel shas many ssu.
deuss who use Rechs also depend heavily on mmpus resources, as I
do; and I feel ssrongly shas snidenn should nor be cvpecsed so invess
