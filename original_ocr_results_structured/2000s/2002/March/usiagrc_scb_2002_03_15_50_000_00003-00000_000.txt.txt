Grill shakeup.

by Michael Andersen
Staff Writer
Following a major employee reorganization at
the Forum Grill, two ofits seven student managers
have resigned and more may leave in coming weeks.

“Things have been frustrating and rather disas-
trons all semmter,” Samantha Garrett ‘04, a student
manager, said this week. “People started threatenr
ing to quit right away.”

At the beginning or the semester, Rita Vogel
and Denise Kaisand. who had been full»time Grill
employees, were moved to Quad dining hall. Ruth
Graﬂ', dieir supervisor, remained at the Grill full-
time, supported by 24 new pnrt.time student posi»
tions. Administrators also created and sought to fill
a new fullrtime position at the Grill during week.
day evenings, a shirt that had previously been cov.
ered only by students.

The night position was ﬁlled three weeks ago
by scottAllen, a ten-year veteran orrestaurant man-
agement.

students otter a number ofexplanarions for the
“pandemonrunr” that some say rollowod these
events. Training the flood of new employees put a
sudden burden on student managers, they say; the
delay between the creation or the evening position
and Allen‘s hiring threw shift schedules into chaos,
as students tried to cover for n full»tlme employee
who didn't yet exist: eliminating two daytime adult
positions increased student employcs' workload;
Allen himself needed a great deal ofassistanee dur-
ing his ﬁrst weekr at the rob; and through it all,
student manogersl meetings, which occurred twice
a month last semester, seemed to have been my
pended.

"it's affected more than ruststudent managers,"
Garrett said. “It’s affected the entire environmento
I think they’ve severely mixtmatcd a lot of the adulu
who have been working here,., I told Dick WYJIA
iams that when i talked to him and he told me he
didn’t know where studenc were getting that idea,
and that he didn't think that theyd mistreated any
one."

Garrett later rewunted the conversation to an
adult who worked at the Grill last semester, “She
just laughed." Garrett said.

Eff ciency movement

Williams, who supervises the Grill and dining
halls, and the reorganization was intended prim}
rily to increase the Grills elherency. Employing two
adults at the Grill simultaneously was a waste of
their talent, he said; professionals weren’t needed
“to make sandwiches or to get a beverage out orthe
cooler. and the two would be better employed at
Quad, as a student employee supervisor and a
kitchen utrlrty worker, respectively.

The remaining full time employee would both
supervise and motivate student employees, work.
ing through the day in two-hourshrro. Meanwhile,
Wrilianns hoped, weekday evenings would beneﬁt
from the same one-adiilt-severalestudenn model.

“We need somestahility," he said. “Seottshould
be the anchor. He gives us that stability."

one adult who worked at the Grill lost some
tor, who :5de not to be identified, said that die
work of keeping die Grill quick and sanitary was
very dilheult with only one full-time employee. “It
was like a tight and a lei"! hand,” she recalled of the
two-adult system. This semester’s Grill, she contrne
ued, seems to have an entirely different and less en-
ioyahle working atmosphere.

One oftlre transplanted employees said she felt
her work at Quad was easier, not harder, and agreed
that the Grill seemed to have suffered from the re-
organization

Though every adult interviewed said that true
dent employees worked hard, all these statemenn
imply studenrs' relative ineirrereney compared to
Fullttlrne employees, due to students potential lack
orcommitmenr to, and experience with, the job.

Allen says he picked up a similar perspective,
“From what I understand, there were a lot ofthrngs
not being done," he said, "They needed some-
one who actually eared. lm not saying that the
kids dont, but yust saying that they needed some
one who deﬁnitely mred wharwas going on. ”and
the only way they felt they could do that was by
bringing someone in from the outside."

Student managers at the Grill disagreed, saying
thatAllen was lowering erhcieney, and ﬂu! students
were apable ormastering their duties through less
than a semester ofontthetjob training.

Several students said that food lines had been
unusuallylong recently. Willams, however. said his
sotistrrs showed that purchases per minute and
quarterehour had not decreased since last semester,
even during the lunchtime rush.

Possible theft

Garrett met with Williams Tuesday to discuss
me reorganization of her night shift, “The explicit
reason Dick Wlliams gave me," she said, “was that
sales were going up and food costs were going up
and the only reason he could think of was too
much free food was going my."

In an interview the next day, Williams said that
though theft was not the primary reason for Allen’s
hiring, the thought had crossed his mind.

“It’s more ofa side beneﬁt," he said.

Garrett said this mistrmt seemed to her to via-
late Grinneu's principles ofself-govemance and said
she “would be willing to bet" thar nightrshrrt stu.
dents had actually given away more food than be.
fore, “just out orspite."

“No one cares anymore," she said, “No one has
any respect {or the situation anymore because we
weren't trusted with that respect."

erlrams said that he generally trusted his ems
ployees. and that no amount orsupervrsion could
make their morally eorrerr.

Purrui Pai'sanl '04, a student manager who re.
signed this week, said that food giveaways at clos-
ing time had also been criticized by administrators,
but that Allen had been correcting die problem by
cutting or? food produttion well before the Grill
was scheduled to close. other Grill employees con.
ﬁrmed that this had happened, but blamed Allen's
inexperience at Grinnell.

Dining Servioes assistant director Mary Kirk
suggested that losses be credited to poorly trained
employees, who might stack sandwiches too high
or pour beverages too liberally. Garrett suggested
that experiments such as peanutebutter pretzels
might have sold more poorly than expected.

Employee dissatisfaction

l Employee shufﬂe causes ‘pandemonium‘ among
student managers; resignations threatened

failing to respond to employee needs. Shirt alloca-
tion was discrganizrcd, he said, training demands
were overwhelming, and student managers advice
on ﬁring employees had been ignored.

other student managers disagrocd wirh Parsani's
judgment ofKirk, saying mat they felt her hands
were tied by higher powers. They agreed, however,
that scheduling shirts and tmlnlng novices had be
come unreasonably demanding.

Laura Krartowin, ‘04, a manager who resigned
recently, said her reasons for leaving were largely
personal and worried that other managers were over.
reacting. She said the "drama” at the Grill hnd not
helped her situation, however, and that work had
become less enjoyable

students also erpreeed confusion over the lack
ormanagers' meetings, which occurred every two
weeks last semester and had provided a forum for
conﬁdanially sharing information,

Williams and Kirk said that the schedule had
ﬁrmed up srnreAllen began work and that the stove
of trainees was a necessary but temporary negative
consequence orthe reorganization.

Kirk acknowledged that managers meetings
should happen more regularly, saying. With break

An employee who was moved to Quadsaid she
was upset by what she perceived as a lack orehoiee
in the matter,

“We were told that our jobs were no longer rat
the Grill] and that we had a job at Quad,” she said
adding, “we were thankrul that we had a rob we
could go to.“

Both transplanted employees had first been or.
