For many, activism is a very personal activity, involving spirituality, community and
deeply held values. A handful of Grinnell activists explain what motivates them.

When Emily Fresh ‘02 was a junior, she completed an ethc
nographic research project on student activism at Grinnell.
During her research, she wanted to interview both activists and
non—activists. However, she realized that ﬁnding members of
the latter group was difficult. She recalled, “i realized that nearly
everyone here, at this point in theireducation, had a ﬁrm grasp
on the necessity ofaction." While the “firm grasp" doesn’t mo.
tivate all Grinnellians to participate in sustained activism, there
are deﬁnitely those who do. The reasons that these people are
active are both personal and diverse.

Religion and spirituality

Many students attribute their activism
to the tenets ofrheir faith and spirituality.
Laura Polstein ’04, for example, who is Cur»
rcntly working with the local group assiste
ing the newly—arrived Afghani refugees, sees
her reasons for activist involvement as both
educative but faithrbased, stemming from
her Judaic worldview. My reasons for poa
litical activity are rooted in my faith. The . .,. ..
development or my faith taught me lovingkindness, Polstein
said, using the translation ofthe Hebrew word chesed. " “This
is the basis for my spiritual energy which motivates inc to be-
come active."

Paul Ford '02, SGA president and participant in such groups
as the Grinnell Coalition to Frcc Mumia Abu Jamal and Grinc
ncll college students Against Sweatshops, also participates in
political causes for faithbased reasons. He cited his experience
in thcAmetican Baptist and United Church
of Christ as motivating factors. “I cannot
separate spirituality from activism," Ford
said. “The former informs the latter.”

For some students, spiritual reasons for
activism were instilled at a young age. Peter
Lavelle ’02, former member of RISE and
active opponent of US. sanctions against
Iraq, is another activist who named his faith
as a role in his political undertakings. “My
activism is a way to perpetuate those values
I learned in the Catholic Church," Lavellc

said,” those values which my rearing has enforced."

Common values

Brian Turner ’02, eclectically active but especially involved
in EAG, attributed both his vocal person: and also his value
system as compelling reasons to be involved in activism. “I feel
like I share an identity witlrthese people," Turner said. “Through
them I have established a value systemireasons to love Grin»
ncll."

Therefore, activities like the protest of the destruction of
the Eddyvilic Dunes his sophomore year were not only fun, but
a way for him to “spend time with those who share a similar
identity."

Member ofthe FTP clean water subgroup Emily zabor '03
said that her activism had its roots in some ofher earliest friendc
ships at Grinnell. She was motivated when her ﬂoormates fresh-
men year were also looking into activist group participation.
“one day theywent to a meeting and I followed,” she explained.

Through his activism, Joe Mowers '02, member of FTP, re-
alized that he could become more autonomous and indepen-
dent. Mowers' reasons for being involved in environmental ac-
tivism were initially esttremcly personal. including his peren—

trial concern for the environment. Later, these personal inter.
ests evolved into “exploratory learning," where he lobbied for
the education on and regulation ofhog factories his freshmen
year. Along with other environmentalists, Mowers founded lowa
studcnisToward Environmental Protection, a organization that
coordinates rallies and other organized activ ies between co]-
leges statewide. He feels a career in environmentalism would be
most fulfilling, “encompassing the necessity for a job with [his]
love ofthe natural world."
Vanessa Pierce ’02, a leader of FTP, sees activism, with its
sociallyeonscious implications, as underly.
-ing academics. This, said Pierce, is one rear
son why she is consistently motivated to be
politically active. Pierce’s environmentalism
is an issue that “has always been close to [her]
heart." Like Mowers, Pierce sees activism is a
way to feel empowered as an individual. She
asks Gtinnellians, attending this school in this
intensely scholastic environment, “How
could you not want to change something?”

Family
,. Lavelle was also inﬂuenced in his active
ism by his family. He was taken to his first a missile protest In
Puget sound at the age orrwo. other students experienced simi-
lar family inﬂuences Beth Kochs OZ activist experiences inc
clude being a member ofRosenfield Committee, participating
.on numerous international human rights issues like medical re-
lief work in Haiti, interning at an organization in Sarajevo for
returning immigrants following civil unrest, and most rcccntly
interning in lsrael and urging for more hu-
mane treatment ofPalestinians,

Koch said her familial inﬂuence was
her biggest motivator. Her sister has
worked for various rcfugcc organizations
in Sarajevo and Bclgrade, and her mother
is a professor ofwomen’s health at the Unis
versity ofNorthern Iowa in Cedar Falls.
“My family has always instilled in me the
values to be concerned with general hue
man rights and welfare," said Koch. She
consistently involves herself in projects
that will resolve human rights violation is-
sues, like her continued work in Israel.

In her research, Freeh conjectured that Grinnell students‘
leanings toward political activism is directly related to the school’s
rural climate. “People feel so isolated, they try harder to be
worldly," said Freeh. This need for increased awareness of the
world informs their public activism, allowing themselves to fecl
better about the world around them.

Within Freeh‘s conclusion lies the irony of Grinnell active
ism: students undertaking many issues that are concentrated as
far away as other continents and hemispheres while working
from rural Iowa. The discrepancy in space and student's immca
diacy towards issues they ﬁght for evidences the importance of
political issues to Grinncllians.

The real results, according to Pierce, are through awareness,
"People fcel that just because there isn't policy change means
you aren't doing anything," she said. “As long as people know
the issues and what’s going on, there is success because this aware
ness changes people's perceptions of the corporations that are
violating the environment. Pooplc’s awareness will make the com.
panies aware oftheir own wrongdoings and will then perhaps
motivate them to change their own policies and practices."

Ride on the w'ld side

(in midnight the day after this past Christmas, Brad liuelllmrst
’05 rode his bike through the freezing streets of Iowa City to the
Greyhound Bus station. HE had his bike, forty dollars, and a
change of clothes. He talked the bus driver into allowing him,
against regulations. to pack his bike on the bus, which soon after
left for Chicago.

Several weeks later, ﬂuellhoist was riding through downtown
Chicago, making one or his many package deliveries of the day,
when an suv going 35 miles per hour hit him from behind. He
was thrown into a parked car, and as his bike ran into him from
behind, the driver drove on, talking on his cellphone. Quellhotxt
got up, pulled his handlebars hack into line, and took off after
the SUV.

"Bike couriers," ﬂuellhorst says, ”are usually slower or on par
with trafﬁc, but beat them at intersections. Couriers do not
stop." He continued, ”The job is fuckin' ilin. There's a kind of
energy you get from being down there in the city. By the time
most people were awake, I’d have delivered a million dollars of
paychecks to them.” Duellhorst's descriptions of the job fit fully
with the cult-like status hike couriers have attained in
tontemporary urban culture,

When he caught up with the SUV which hit him, ﬂuellhorst did
what he claims to be ”standard practice” among couriers; lie
bashed out the cars' tear windows with a U-Lock. Speaking of
such practices, Guellhorst stated flatly, ”If you work, you will get
hit.” He went on to describe tabbies passing two inches from his
elbow, and people who would run out into the street and start a
ﬁst ﬁght with a courier who cut them off,

Guellhorst ﬁrst had the idea to become a courier from a show
he heard on NPR when he was 13. Another NPR piece late last
fall, about NYC couriers in the wake of Sept. 11, further sparked
his imagination, and led to his seemingly unprepared departure
from his home in Iowa City in late December.

When he arrived in Chicago, he spent several days riding the
mean, getting used to downtown, and looking for work. He
ﬁnally found it, as an independent contractor for a major courier
company. "It used to lie that all couriers were independent
tontrattors," Quellhorst said, ”no hours, no rules. If you deliver
the package, you get paid." the corollary to that is no health
insurance or job security. Recently, job reform has come to major
titres with extensive tounei systems, and tourieis are hired as
permanent company employees with benchts.

”Almost without fail," said ﬂuellhorst, "couriers are single men
between 19 and 23. About 50-50 Black and White. I knew two
female couriers, and I probably knew every runner in Chicago."

Quellhorst worked on commission, ”12 hours a day without a
break.” HE estimates logging ”50 miles a day that were spent
hanging off produce trucks and going all out. Ihe first three days
of work I came home and couldn't walk. I had to crawl up the
stairs to bed." he slept four hours, and woke up at 4 d.m. to get
a ride to the train to get to work on time, to do it all over again.
Would he do it again?

Laura Gaasland-Tatro (2) is a ﬂintknapper

Caught knapping

Lara Gaasland-Iatro '05 breaks things when she wants to relax,
Gaasland~Tatlo'is a flintknappcr. someone who practices the
prehistoric craft of making tools from glass_in her case, either

plate glass or glassy stories like obsidian.

By breaking chunks off of a larger piece and then shaping
those chunks with a Cnpper~tipped hand tool, she treates
arrowheads and other miniature glass pieces that can be either
decorative or functional. the copper tool gn'ps the surface of the
glass, allowing the flintknapper to flake pieces off with pressure
rather than by chipping.

The eventual shape of each piece, Gaasland-Iatro said, is
determined by “what pieces you break off.

"You start out with a fairly large piece of stone, and end up
with something quite small compared to the piece you had
originally," she said.

rlintknapped ioob aren't just attractive; theyre also useful.
”It actually works quite a bit better than anything eke for
cutting leatherim, say, steaks," she said.

Some of Gadslandciatro's friends like to cook using
ﬂintknapped tools, because ”when it comes to slicing, it's the
best kind of tool you can have." this is because glass can hold
the sharpest edge possible, down to a thickness or one molecule.

Flintknapping can pose ethical issues for people who prettier
it because some people try to pass their pieces off as ancient
artifaca. To prevent that, Gaasland~Tatro sign all her work with
a diamond engraver pen before each piece leaves her control.

GaaslandJatto's hobby is a kind of meditation, she said. "If
i'm stressed out, I tan just work on flintknapping for half an
hour and feel completely calm afterwards." —En'k Gable
