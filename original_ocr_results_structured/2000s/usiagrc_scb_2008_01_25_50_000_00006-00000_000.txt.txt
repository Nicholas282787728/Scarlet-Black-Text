An RLC and her husband moved to Grinnell from Las Ve-
gas, and created a home in a dorm-like apartment

“Sex!" reads a calendar in the kitchen. “For
what college costs there should be more of
it." A Reefs-r Mmlrlzn poster
decorates the wall above a

huge drum set. South Park ”We only [Jerome aware of

memorabilia sits along
shelves, hangs on pegs in the
living room and the show's
characters form the pieces
of chessboard on the coffee
table. Loosehead RLC Kim-
berly Hinds—Brush and her husband Randy
Brush are sitting in the living room as an old
episode or Cbm'mﬂd plays in the background.

“South Palk's not my favorite,"said HindS’
Brush, “That would be Randy. I like crime
dramas." Her TV interests also include a love
for Joss Whedon creations Biiﬂy lire Vimlpirr
riayeaziagei, and Fitz/7y. She owns the DVDs
orthese shows, part ortheir massive movie col
lection. which she often lends out to students,

The couple left Las Vegas two and half
years ago to make their way to small-town
Iowa “1 was looking for ajob at a small school,"
said HindstBrush,"and Randy wanted a small
town."After landing a job offer rrom Griiiiicll,
a short visit to campus sealed
the deal. “It was spring and
there were mbbits hopping
around everywhere,” she
said.

“She called me that night
and said thatwe had to move
here,“ said Brush. Although
the rabbits are still close to
her heart, HilldS’Bl‘lISl'i said that her favorite
thing about Grinnell is the friendliness ofthe
college community,

Brush has also made Griiinell his home.
He plays with four music groups at Grinnell,
including a punk-klczmcr band. “l was a pro
fessional drummer until I was thirty," said
Brush, "and I must be setting a record for the
most percussion equipment crammed into thc
smallest space.”

Besides the huge drum set in the entrance,
Brush has African drums in the living room,
drumheads hanging on the wall, and various
other percussion equipment on shelves all over
the apartment, “And I’ve got a didgeridoo on
orderl" he exclaimed. Luckily, the apartment

is separated from the Loose dorms by an enr
trance hallway, so Brush can play “\‘vitl‘iout ch
eryone hearing nit all the time."

This separation also
means that their weekend
evenings usually aren't dis-
turbed by Grinnellians' noisy
antics. “We only become
aware of parties when people
get too exuberant," said
Hinds-Brush, laughing.

Brush and HindsrBrush
hope to stay on at Grinnell for as long as per
sible. “Ifthete’s any way for Kim to get a per
manent position we would love to stay here."
said Brush.

The couple met while working for Equr
nox International. a company that was shut
down by the Federal Trade Commission for
defrauding individuals and using illegal re
cruitment methods,

“But I swear," said HindsrBrush. “We were
just working in the warehouse! We weren't
writing contracts or anything." After Hinds-
Brush got her dcgree in education leadership
at the University ofLas Vegas, Nev, the couple
was ready to leave the big city.

“We love it here,” said

Hinds-Brush, “but some-
times it would be nice if
there were cities closer
the weather doesn't usually
bother me. We bought warm
clothes."

HindsrBrush said that
she socmlizes with the stir
dents in her cluster frequently and still keeps
in roueh with Grinnell grade. A painting by a
past Loosehedd SA covers it wall of their 1in
iiigrooi-n.

“The students are great," said Hintlsr
Brush. Even student partying has not been a
large issue during her time here. “I knew it was
something I would be dealing with," she said,
“It wasn’t like, ‘What?! Students here drink?!w

Hinds-Brush is hardly naive when it comes
to college life. Instead, she and Brush have
taken some of the best of doim life and in-
corporated it into their only semi—adult apart—
merit.

“Living here." said Brush, “is like being a
student without the responsibilities ofclass."
