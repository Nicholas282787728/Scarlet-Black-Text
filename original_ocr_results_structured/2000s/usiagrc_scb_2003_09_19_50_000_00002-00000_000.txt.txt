Memo switches to
online format

Srartrng thewcok oiocrober 7th, rhe campus
Memo will be almost exalusivcly published unline,
Mickey Munlcy'87. vree presidentfor Communi—
cation and Evenrs, sard rhar while prrnted copies of
rlre Memo will still be avail-ble, rlre Merrro will
probably no longer be 1ch out rn the posr ofﬁce.

“By having the Memo onlrne, we not only wrll
be saving paper and make drasric cuts or costs, bur
we’ll be able to grre more flesrbiliry in what makes
it into the Memo every week," Munley said.

Because oFrhe proposed switch to orrlrne fore
mar, rhe deadlines on the Memo will be cxicnderl
From 0 am. Friday ro mrdnight Monday

Some worry that making the Memo web-based
will unfairly disadvantagestatrmembcrs who don’r
have regular acoess to the rnterner. “I'm eoneerned
that making the Memo available solely electron.-
cally curs a whole los oimembers of the Grinnell
College community out ofan importanr commu-
nrmrioo medium," said Sabrina Ross ‘04.

Jon Perit '01, drrecror of Conference Opcme
tions said that the memo would nor be published
exclmively online and rhar stair would only need

FTP makes Grinnell a

Members ofFrcc the Planer (FTP) achieved a
major goal this year when information Techrrol.

in campus computer labs from 30 percenr poste
consumer recycled paper so 100 percent post—cone
sunrer recycled paper.

in order to make the switch and accomodare
the higher price ofrlre new paper, members rafFl‘l’
needed ro ﬁnd a way ro reduce paper consump.
rion rn rlre campus computer labs. The group do.
erded rlrat rhe best way so do rhis would be re edu-
cate Gr-innell sruderrrs on how they could each do
their part to conserve paper. ,

By making a eorrsciouselrort ro prrnr less, prrnr
doublersided whenever possible and refrain from
raking paper out of she labs For other uses, Grlnncll
students were successful in reducing their paper
eonsumprion by over 20,000 sheers rn the 2002.
2003 school year. This was enough ro allow For

eonsumer recycled paper. “I belreve it would be fear
sible for every departmenr on campus ru purchase
100 percent post—consumer recycled paper, iFrhey
are rvrllrng to rcduoeeensumprionwrthin rherr de.
partmenr." said Linda wells '05, rhc FTP foresr
subgroup co.leader

Because ir is more expensrvo, using the new
paper prmenrs some ditheulrros “In order ro save
on shipping, 1 had ro order a year's supply at a rime
so it filled a semioailer," said Karen Mchlchic,
the head of ITS, “Thur gave us srorage problems."

Storage was nor an rtsue before ITS switched
to 100 percenr posreconsumer recycled paper be.
cause she company they purchased the old paper
from, Boise caserde, was able to deliver ln smaller
amorrnts at a lower eosr thanks ro rheir business
relationships wrrh nearby srores. Tire Recycled
Prodrrers Coop, lTS’s new paper supplier, currently
lacks business partners that would reduce rhe eosr
otshrpmenrs.

MeRirehie remained optirnisrie, however, “Th:
Recycled Producrs Co-op is working wirh Sraples
ro provide delrvery service of recycled products,"
McRitchiesard. “irrhat happens, we can order from
rlre Marshallrown [Sraplesl store and get weekly
delivery."

According to FTP, purchasrog 100 percent pose
consumer recycled paper will save 120 rrees, 20,500
kilonorrs orelecrricity, 35,000 gallons onatcr and
300 pounds of air pollution rlris year alone.
