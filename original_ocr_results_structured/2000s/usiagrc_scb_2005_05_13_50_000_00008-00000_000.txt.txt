Straight

to court

Sara Thomas '08 sued her Colorado High School when they
wouldn’t allow students to start a Gay-Straight Alliance

av SARAH MIRK

Sara Thomas ‘08 did not intend to sue her own high
school. What she did intend was to stair a chapter of
GayrStraight Alliance (GSA), a nauomvidc network
ot’ school clubs rhat light homophobia on campuses.
The situation spit-tied into the courtroom from there.

There is “a strong voice for homophob' “ in Thom-
as's hometown otcolorado springs, she ,bur shc
ienlizcd how srrong rhis voice was while attending
Palmer High School.

“A lot ofmv friends weie starting to come out and
they \vcic being ticated with some hostility" she |CT
rncnrbcrcd, A lot ornarnc calling Peopl c yelling gay
slurs at football games. It got me to realize just how
much homophobia existed in the school." Thomas
decided to stun a GSA, hoping
it would provoke hcr classrnarcs
into thinking about homosexuality
more deeply than the slurs thrown
around the hallways.

Thomas and several odacrs CICT
ated a school club application and
submitted it to the principal who,
Thomas said, rejected the club
without even looking at rhc «pr
pbcation," The principal claimed
she was worried that if GSA was
allowed on campus, student hate groups might form
in reaction, Thomas was ﬁnally told, “Palmer High
School isn‘t ready for a GSA." However. she was not
ready ro give up on the GSA.

At the advice of the American Civil Liberties
Union, Thomas began keeping a detailed rccord or
all of her GSA-related activities. Her records now ﬁll
three giant binders,wirh newspaper articles, emails and
summaries ormcetings side by side with the names of
lawyers and trial dates.

Thomas submitted modiﬁed GSA applications
twicc more.The last application spanned 17 pages and
addressed not only the standard goals of the club, but
also concerns Thomas has heard people raise at her
own school and elsewhere like, “The GSA will not be
a sex club."

In December of 2003,Thomas and rhe other club
founders ﬁled a lawsuit against their high school with
the help ofa pro bono lawyer. They riled the lawsuit on
a Friday so that they would have a weekend to get over
the “shock” before they had to fact: their classmates and
administrators

Thomas was not looking forward to string the
school from which she needed to graduate, but felt like
she “couldn't back down.’“‘l felt like I would be giving

people

”ll’s a scary issue for a lot of

Bur / think people are
talking about it a lot morei
what/imam; to be gay and how
people should respond to that"

into the homophobia, she said. “I'm'lucky that I have

. parents and a church community that raised me to
be an actitnst so that 1 can stand up tor whar I helrcve
in and not be at t id ”

Even so, Thomas “olnCL‘l about how the school
community would react especially hcrtrrentis. She told
her best fiiend about the lawsuit during the weekend
after its tiling, she said confessing to her rhat thc road
ahead would be difﬁcult and “controversial,"

Thomas' fears were well founded; as the main
founder of the club,Tliomas’s name was “dragged ev-
erywhere By rhe end, 1 had lost my friends,” she
said. “I think no scary to be in that conrroversral placel
was being labeled ‘lesbian,’ and what did that mean for
them, was is still okay to hang out with me?"

The largest negative reaction
from rhc snidenrs was due to the
school's response: on the day that
schools response to the lawsuit was
due, the principal announced they
were changing their club policy to
a “warrior system."

Certain previously school-
sponsored groups would now
become “independent srudcnr
groups," which ineanr thar, while
they were still allowed to meet on
campus, their rights to use the PA system, post posters
on school walls, receive teacher stipends and have their
pictures in the yearbook were revoked,

The clubs that were renamed, including cancer
education club and community service clubs, are all
gone now, said Thomas. “They didn't have access to the
school community" without announcements or post-
crs,Thoinas said. students directed their anger over rhc
lost clubs at rlic GSA plaintiffs, “We were deﬁnitely
blamed for that," said Thomas.

The situation started to “Lighten up”on campusjust
this year, said Thomas, after an antiegay activtst from
Kansas caught wind of rho case and drove his church
congregation to protest Palmer High School. While
the protesters held ilnfl’gity signs and shouted “God
hates tags" in front orthc high school, a crowd of 1,000
community members and students gathered on the op-
posite side of the street to show their support for the
gay community

“It's a scary issue for a lot ofpeople,”Tliomas reﬂect—
ed. “But I think people are talking about it a lot moth
what it means to be gay and how people should respond
to rhar."Thomas testiﬁed at a preliminary injunction for
the case over winter break, but, with the lawsuit still in
the courts, Thonias‘s battle is far from over.
