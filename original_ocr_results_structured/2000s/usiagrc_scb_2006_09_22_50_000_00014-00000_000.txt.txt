and points while defense struggles

BY MACAELA HOLMES 81 PATRICK RITTER

The Grinnell defense gave up 49 points to Carroll College
last Saturday in a 49—14 loss at Roscnbloom Field, a defeat der
fensive lineman Matt ”Tiny" Vigil ’07 attributed to the defense
being “one step off." The sour orthe game looked plomlsing
for the Grinnell tealn with a kickoff rctuln to Carroll’s 30-)mrd
line, but things went downhill from there as Cal-roll scored 28
straiglir points in the ﬁrst half.

Grinnell’s offense moved lllc hall throughout rhe game,
passing for 215 yards and running for 124, but was unable to
convert the yardage into points as they went scoreless through
the ﬁrst three quarters.

They did post 14 points in the fourth quarter off of a 13s
yard Sean Pfalzel '07 suamble and a newt-d pass from Pfalzer
te Kyle Perry'os. Perry leads the ch in receptions through
three games and Pfalzer leads in total offensive yards and is
second' in passing yards.

Jonathan Antr'lm 09 said. “We have all the weapons but we
havent put it together as a complete effort yet.’

The Pioneers are tied for ﬁrst in the M\VC in offensive
ﬁrst downs and are fourth in total offense with 347 yards per
game. But the defense is last in every major category, allowing
522 yards and so points per game. That is 140 yards and 23
points more than the second-(mlasl teams. They gave up 517
yards to Carroll.

Carroll running back Bryce Crocker ﬁnished with 141 of
those yards rushing on 25 carries for two touchdowns. Start—
ing quartet-back Chris Rogers was 13-18 for 126 yards and
two scores before being knocked out otthe game in the second
quaiter by Brett Maloney ’09.

Maloney led the Pioneer defense in tackles for the second
time in three games with 11.}ohn Hereford’lO recorded Grin»
nell’s first interception of the year at the end of the first half.

Vigil believes the defense is getting better but needs to
make fewer mistakes.

“Wey'usr missed a few steps that caused us to lose momenr
