random Being a bit excessive?

Man, I never sleep

Students speak
out about what's
on their minds in
142 words, and
you’re invited! If
you have a
random rant,
email it to
almid@grinneii.edu.
After all.
complainaing in a
public forum is
always more furl
than doing it
alone.

I've seen two of them in the l ttwe days: people

wandering around the general VI ty of Cowles, chat»
ting merrily away on . . . cell phones? Beyond that,
there seem to be an increasing number of pagers and
other communication devices riding happily on the belts
of students. What, I ask you, do Grinnell students need
cell phones and pagers for? Are they drug dealers or
something?

If they have to drivelong distances pr something,
and have a phone in the car for emergencies, I can
understand that, That makes sense. But the last per-
son lsaw using one was right outside the dining hall,
within about 20 feet of both the public phone in the
computer lab and the phone closet in the hallway.
Doesn’t that strike anyone as a little excessive?

Sand. It's in my shoes. my sucks, my bed, my res
frigerator. it has most decidedly NOT made the ice go
away, but it sure has made the floor of the Forum Grill
more treacherous than ever. it has turned my room
into a bigger sandbox than my Daddy ever built. And
this afternoon, after 1 swept my floor twice and shook
enough send out of my rugs to replenish California's
disappearing coastline, the thought struck me: I have
had enough of sand. It’s time to do something else
to make our sidewalks Safe. After all, if I wanted to
live at the beach, I wouldn’t say in Grinnell. I'd
move to a small island in the Mediterranean,

Welcome to Grinnell, race Bell, you shall be my
excuse to rant. A couple nights ago I tried to visit
our new Taco Bell, and when I pulled through the
driverthru around ll pm i was informed that they
were Closed, Needless to say, I was shocked and dis-
appointed having nevor encountered a Taco Bell clos-
ing before 3 am. This brought an issue back to my
mind: we are students in a college town (face it, city
of Grinnell, we make you) and Subway is the only place
open after midnight. What Grinnell needs is a 24-hour
diner, coffee shop, or restaurant (he. Perkins in Ner
ton, alas, a long drive at 3 am) where students can
go in the middle ofvthe night to talk, study, and down
copious amounts of lire-giving coffee. We are 1300
potential late night customers, when will someone
get the clue?
