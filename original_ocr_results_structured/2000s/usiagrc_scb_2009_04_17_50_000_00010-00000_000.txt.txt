Ornithology takes flight for Grinnellians

Dylan O’Donoghue ’11 and Joey Wendel ’11 share their experiences with their offbeat passion for birdwatching

BY MANDO MONTANO

When walking back to Main Hall from ARH. the ﬁrst thing
that Dylan O’Donoghue '11 names is the pecking mm: in the
bushes outside ofMear’s Cottage, She then tries to identify with
greater speciﬁcity exactly where the pecking is coming from.
She learns that the loud hollow tapping is a Woodpecker, a com-
mon bird on campus, and continues to try to identify it based
on weight, color, and distinctive marks. “There's very rarely large
woodpeckers," O’Donoghue said. “That’s sacred sort of shit.”

Dylan O'Donoghue is a birdwatcher.

O'Donoghue began birdwatching when she was in ﬁrst grade
after learning that she was allergic to most household pcts’ fur
and saliva. As a result, she was only able to have birds and lizards
growing up. “What really sticks is that those are the really wack
animals to play with," O'Donoghue said. “1 found that studying
birds was my way ofplaying with them."

However, O’Douoghuc's hobby soon turned into a passionate
lifestyle. When she entered her senior year of high school, she
started birdwatching With her teacher, who was once the presir
(lent ofthe New York Audobon Society.

“It was always him and this one other teacher throughout
high school who were really into bird watching, so wed always
go together," O'Donoghue said. “When I wanted to do an inde-
pendent study, he told me, 'tl'ils is what you have to do to become
good.“

O'Donoghue’s life adapted to birdwatehing; she woke up at
6 am to ﬁnd birds and entered in bird watching competitions in
order to hone her birdwatching skills.
Although O'Donoghue doesn't now wake
up at six in the morning to bird watch, she
still observes birds around campus and
tries to identify them either on purpose or
accidentally. “When you walk outside, you're
hyperaware of birds, it's kinda like voices in
your head," O'Donoghuc said. “The birds are
always singing songs and doing sruit, so it's
kind orhard to carry on a conversation out»
side because I’m always paying attention to
the birds."
O'Donoghuc's easual birdwatclung is fuss
quent enough so that she is able to give names
to the individual birds she sees and remembers.
“Each bird has a unique voice,“ she said."lfl see
the same bird or hear the same voice over and over
again l'il name it, usually like Bob or Jared."
Though O'Donaghuc names speciﬁc birds
like old friends, for fellow birdwatcher Joey Weir
del ’11, birdwatching takes on a different role in his life. “Bird
watching is a spott,”Wendel said.“l try to bring a notepad, bins
oculats and write down the attributes of the bird."

Wendel, like O’Donoghuc, is an avid birdwatching enthusir
as! who also began birdwatehing in childhood. His mother was
the President ofthe Birdwatching Club as an undergraduate at
the University of Michigan, while his Dad would birdwatth fre-
quenrly. "On road trips they would always point out birds and
we’d stop to look at them,”Wendel remarked.

For Wendel, birdwatching doesn’t fill a pet void but
instead he admires birds for their natural beauty, “ Birds are
really mysterious and beautiful," Wendel said, smiling. “I
guess it's the mystery element. you see something that's
so colorful and beautiful, it’s just so incred-

ible to see it and appreciate it.”

Both O'Donoghue and Wendel's
love of birdwatching caused them to
form the hirdwatching club at Grinnell,

Even though the club only consists of the

two of them and a handﬁll oftheir friends,

they have plans to continue birdwatch-

ing and hopeﬁllly get more members of

the Grinnell community involved as

well. “We’re not sure what it’s going to

amount to." Wendel said. “Even ifit’s

not a very ore ganized club, we hope that it’s a my for

people to communicate birdwarehing. and organize birdwatchr
ing Lrlps outside otGrinntll,"
