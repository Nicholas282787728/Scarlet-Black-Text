for others it's the fourth.
Students offer their
perspectives about what it
means to be in Grinnell.

in some ways lam vcrycxclied ro be rsrurning ro Grinnell
ibis semesrer. lger ro see my old iriends, nieer new ﬁtsirycnrs ro
rermtire, and enroll in challenging classes like Chemistry is
Everywhere (remedial ehemisrry tor English mayors) andWords
are Everywhere (remedial English for English maiois),

However, die new year docs not look to be all daisies arid
roses: 1 have noticed a lot of troublesome changes on campus.
It seems that Grinnell isn’t fully as diifcrent from the rcstofr‘hc
eounrry m we would like to rhini. in her, Grinnell is sadly
beginning ro go the ivny oi rhe no or rho rounrry. I eould
blame diis on rhe piovalenee ofeell plums on Campus, rhr new
rerruiring siraregies orrhe eollege, or even our dear presidenr.
But alas the fault is in ourselves. not the ﬂdmlnlstmllﬂl’l.

The rurning poinr lorcrinnellseeins id have been the Eire
tiori Day Riots oFZOOO, hetrer known to the mi of the country
aSSlmply the Grinnell Rdots.Thc riot activillcxwwhlch included
random fires. acts ofkindnzss and cannrhalism—took a heavy
toll on the Gtinncll COmmun It was not long after Election
Day that Ctinnell students, fearing for rhcir own IIVCS a: well as
ihose otrbeir spousﬁ and children, began ro arm ihemseivcs
heavily. It srnrred with pocketknives, sluiiiyiiiorhing is way up
