How we come to grips with dropping the ball

After eight years of stagnation, Americans should choose change when choosing their next leader

1 often wonder what the president thinks at nrght,
when left alone to his thoughts. Does he lament the
fact that his presidency has failed, that hrs legacy lies
in tatters or that his [HTCOHCCIVBL‘ policies have (lﬂ’
strayed our nation's prestige around the world? Surely,
after one peels back “layer A" (that of the stubborn
Texan who refuses to admit mistakes), “layer B" (that
of the stubborn child
who lacks the foresight
or a leader), and “layer
C" (that of the stubborn
son who competes with
his father), there is a man
somewhere, deep down
inside, who realizes that
he dropped the ball.

President Bush’s stewardship of the nation has
been marked by Little more than mediocrity and in-
eptitude, and his tenure in ofﬁce seems to be one that
most Americans would prefer to forget, For liberals,
conservatives and independents alike, there has been
no shortage orrnstancos to complain about, and cers
tainly, the president has disappointed on both the for
eign and domestic stages.

Yet the criticisms of Bush often focus on the
drsastrous lrnq War, the insufferable secrecy of his
administration, the dangerous repercussions of the
president’s haughty style of governance and the sheer
inability of the White House to provide for the basic
needs of the nations people. And while these are all
legitimate grievances, Bush's greatest shortcoming, in
my mind, is that he has failed to inspire the American

people and to call upon us to combat the consequenc-
cs oran irresponsible, scltish and burgeoning civiliza-
tion—Washington corruption, world poverty, global
climate change, ethnic discrimination and health care
reform, to name a few.

And, sadly, Bush had an opportunity to ‘tht. After
the carnage in September 2001, the president, wields

irrg newtound polrrrcal
capital in one hand and
worldwide sympathy m
the other, had the abilt
ity to enlist the American
people in a new campaign
to fix our broken system
and to treat our ailing na-
tron. However, President
Bush predictably disappointed: he wasted the good
will or the world atter a series of unnecessary and
ill-conceived moves that lead to the War on Terror.
Bush's actions had consequences; the War on Terror,
the ccntcrpiccc of the president's program. disapt
pointed, gradually extinguishing the postt9/11 tire
that burncd in the hearts ofthc people and replacmg
that fire with bitterness and anger.

As a result, whrle Americans have been eagerly
waiting to repair a broken system, a system in which
coitntless individuals lack health care and the means
to subsist comfortably and in which the government
no longer acts on behalf of the people but is consumed
by its courtship oi'pctrolcurn, insurance and business
lobbyists, they have been saddled with a president
who has been content to merely administer the nae

tion, not to lead it forward,

As Americans are forced to hide their time, the
condition ofour nation, the cleanliness of our envr
roruncnt and the quality ororrr lives gradually woir
ens. Indeed, as presidential candidate John Edwards
explained two nights ago during the Democratic
debate, “The truth is, when this election is over, I’m
going to be fine. Senator Clinton is going to be fine.
Senator Obama’s gomg to be due. The question is:
VVrll America be fine? And will we ensure that our
children have a better life than we have had? That’s
the responsibility we have—and I think this is the
great moral test of our generation." And Edwards
is absolutely right. For eight years we have been led
astray, and it is time to find our way back onto the
correct path.

Perhaps eight years or a divisive administration
interested more in its own preservation than the int
tercsts ofthe people is what our nation needed, rronly
in the sense that it has made us realize the kind of
leadership we wish to have no more of. By repudiat-
rng Bush 5 style ofgovemance, Americans have shown
thatwe are still hungry for change and ready to -ive
towards great goals. Whatwe lack now is a leader with
the rhetoric to inspire, the ability to guide us forward
and the talent to channel our impulses and infantile
ideas into a coherent program. In 2004, we made the
mistake or reelecting President Bush and thereby
condemned our nation to another four years offailure.
In 2008,we have a chance to right this wrong. And if
we make the same mistake twrce, it will be President
Bush who has the last laugh.

lntramurals take off

Most Grinnellians aren’t star atht
letes. and not everyone on campus could
tell you who won last week’s World See
ties. But that alone shouldn't discount
the importance of having a strong intra—
mural program
full of oppor-
tunities for stu-
dents ot'all skill
levels to get a
team of friends
together and
have fun. Ins
tramurals will
always be important for wellness and
for a break from the rigors of Grinnell
academic life.

After last year's ermtic season of
intramurals, the consistent sight of soct
cer, ﬂag football and ultimate Frisbee
has been welcome, More students part
ticipatcd in fall intramural sports this
year, and the trend will continue, as 15
teams have signed up for this comes
ter’s dodgeball league, almost doubling
the number of teams who played last

spring.

Much of the credit should be given
to the new director of intramurals,Tim
Hammond. Advertising on campus
has been more noticeable, meetings
with captains have been instituted to
clear up rule disputes before they hap-
pen, games have run smoothly in the

future, though,
we hope to see
fall intramural
sports spread out
throughout the
week. This year,
they took place
on the same
night, prevents
ing students rrom playing more than
one sport.

The next step is ensuring that numt
bets stay high. Encouraging wellness
should be a top college priority, and
continuing to uphold a strong intramu-
ral program should be an integral part
of this effort.

Caucus planning stalls

on Jan. 3, thousands oflowans will
meet up in living rooms and prrblrc

places to help choose the Democratic
and Republican nominees for president
of the United States. With no incum—
bent in either race, the Iowa caucuses
could have a tremendous impact on
who wins the nominationiand thus
the election.

It’s a pity that most students might
not get a chance to participate.

Thanks to competition between dif—
ferent states, this year’s Iowa caucuses
are earlier than ever—and unlike past
years, will take place while Grinnell
College is on break.

For many students whose homes are
far away from Grinnell, this makes ate
tending the caucuses all but impossible.
others, however, might be sufﬁciently
interested and close to Grinnell to
make the trip back to participate in this
important and unique political event.

Unfortunately, even these students
might find caucusing this year difficult.
Because Grinnell college has a closed
campus over winter break, students
who want to come back to caucus may
not have any place to stay.

Student political groups have been

range for students to return for the caut
cuses, but January keeps getting closer
and we have heard no further word
about whether this will be possible.

There are logistical problems wrth
reopening the dorms in the middle of
winter break, but the reasons for do
ing so far outweigh the reasons against.
VVouldsbe caucus—going students are
one important group whose interests
are harmed, but the whole college
would suffer.

The possibility of attracting the
support or hundreds of Grinnell stilt
dents gives the college political promit
nenceiund attracts visits by major
political figures, including presidem
tial candidates. A decision to keep the
dorms closed would send a message
that Grinnell College is not a worth--
while place to campaign, and deprive
the college of the intellectual enrich-
ment that comes from direct engage—
ment with America's future leaders.

The administration should open the
dorms for the Iowa caucuses, and ans
nounce this decision soon so students
and candidates alike can include that in
their plans.
