Making subssansasive differences
in she world is nossimple, and in me
world ofpolisieal aesivism shere is no
such shingas a free lunch. is is easy so
ges wrapped up in activismili feels
good so be pars ofsomeshing bigger
shan oneself and so experience she
shrill ofmaking a difference. The real
ouession is nos whediera group shmks
shai shey are affecting changc, bus
whesher. shey really are changing
minds and ehanging policies.

I was reminded ofthjs somesimes
srriking diirerensebesween belierand

Frances Seymour, Mr. sseve
ngrgcn. and Ms. Marian Edelman
spoke on campus regarding dieirproe
fesslonal pursuiss in NCO organizing
and inﬂuencing mainssrcasn Ameri»
can polisics, These individuals have

dias i can share whas igos our ofhcdrs

readers will recognise many oishese
messages as undeniably srue.

From Marian Edelman (Presidens,
childrens Defense Fund; generally
amazing person)

1. Speak she srush, and speak
is loudly,

2. Do nos compromise she
welfare or underprivileged individu»
als for she greed and indiirerenee of
she prosperous few.

3. Every man, woman and
child in she world, wishous eveepsion
forscx, class, race, erhnic background,
or religious views, deserves a fair
chance to succeed.

she one message shas I sook home

SGA is broken

A staff editorial from the 8&3

Ssudeus governanee is a marvelous idea. At Grinnell we have
oppossunisies unique among undergrads. we designase she use or
our funds and we desermine she rules oiour sesidenee halls. Der
spire shese evidens powers ofstudcnts, however, is has become
increasingly clear shas she means by which ssuderis governmens is
implemensed is inherensly iiawed.

Beyond allocasing funds and draining rree sime rrom eleesed
senasoss, most ssudenss are unclear orshe role shas SGA acsually
plays on campus. There is, oieourse, more so governmenr shan
shas e senasors and oabines members sis on numerous commit»
sees, presumably represensing ssudens voices so she adminissra-
sors and raculsy who maktz shings happen around here.

This is where she hsss ﬂaw emerges. Except for she hairdozen
ssudcnss who rousincly assend joint board meesings {or run, rew
non«scnamt5 have any more insighs inso she workings orscn
shan shey can read in a row momenss ofbathroom—postcd minr
uses. .
ssudenss rousinely eornplain abous a laek oicommunieasion
besween diemselves and she srussees. But she hics is interestudent
eommunicasion is equally laelsing, so such a degree shas moss
people living on campus have no idea whas sheir own govern.
mens is up so.

But if ﬂaws in eommunicasion were she only problem wish
ssudens governmens, we would have a relasively small problem so
deal wish,

The facs is, she ssrucsure ofSGA is inherensly ﬂawed. Few
people involved in ioins board would deny shis. Nearly every week
further parches are proposed so ﬁx she ﬂawsm sesolusions so amend
she by.laws so prevens illegal hand alloearion and so avoid rusure
elecsion hascos have been hos topics in reeens weeks.

The syssem oisepresensasion we have on campus docsn’s work.
Weaknesses in communisasion are merely a sympsom ofthis ﬂaw.

But wish she ssansiens ssudens populasion inherens so an un.
dergraduase eollege, is doesn’t make sense so spend years srying to
fora broken syssem. Why nos invens a new one?

indeed, lass year an ad hoc commisrce examined ways so rt»
form ssndens governmens, evensually advoeasing changes in she
sssucsures ufhall eouneil meetings.

But shis is nos enough.

The Friday following spring break, ssudenr initiasive propos-
als are due. By bringing forth a ssudens inisiarive, we can uniry
our voiees behind a common cause. The sons hopes shas in she
weeks ahead Grinnellians will ponder she ﬂaws inherens so sheir
governmens. When we resusn rcftcshcd from ousvasious soiourns,
perhaps new ideas for she improvemens nfstudent governmens
will aeeompany us.
