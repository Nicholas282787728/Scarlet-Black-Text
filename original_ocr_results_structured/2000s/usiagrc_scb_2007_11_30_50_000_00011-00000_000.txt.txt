Bangkok and Michelangelo in; food form

Pineapple, chow mein noodles and candied pecans: secrets of the Comeback Café

BYSARAHMIRK
How does a small town keep a secret this
good? Few students eat at the Comeback Cafe,
probably because it is farther than one block
from campus and because the establishment
is mysteriously lacking a sign, But this does
not trouble me; I don't want students to know
about the Cafe. 1 like the restaurant the way
it is: it laid~
back, clean
lunch

and beautiful natural light. Students would just
clutter it up ifthey realized it is the most fans
lastlc sandwich place in town. Stay away If too
many sandwich-grubbing college hoodlums
start coming, distinguished se-
nior citizens may have to wait
for seats.

on Tuesday, when the sky out-
side was cold and a cruel blue,
but the warmth and charm inn
side shone out the restaurant‘s
large windows, I had been to
the Comeback Cafe four times
before this trip and I ordered
the Bangkok wrap ($5.95) all
four times.The Cafe’s menu contains three key
secret ingredients: pineapple, crunchy chow
mein noodles and candied pecansThcsc three
simple items deliver an unexpected sucker-
punch of deliciousness to many of the Gates

what could make that complex spiral offlavors.
The Bangkok wrap combines all three of the
Cafe’s secret ingredients with cheese and spicy
Thai vinaigrette sauce. I can’t stop thinking
about it, Late at night in Burling, staring at the

Today. hOWa
cver, I decide 1
must force myself to try new things, such as the
Michelangelo wrap ($5.95) which promises a
new world ofred bell peppers, pesto and black
olives. The waitress comes: she is young and
friendly. 1 really, really want to
order the Bangkokwmp. I want
to eat that wrap everyday ofmy
life, but especially right now I
reluctantly forcc my mouth to
form the word “Michelangelo"

The Honey Club arrives, a charmingly
normal wheatrbrcad sandwich layered with
deli meats, just like your mom would make
it. The Michelangelo is, indeed, filled with
red peppers, pesto and olives, but 1 wish the
cheese was melted and the whole thing was
more saucy, My friend’s Crispy Chicken salad
is sprinkled with pineapples, candied pecans
and chow mein noodles I scrape up the last
remains from her plate and swoon over the
Bangkok wraprlike ﬂavor.

“This place is the best in the world," my
friend says, grinning at the newborn and wrinr

6:45 a.m.The General. my guinea pig, starts
squeaking. I pretend to ignore him. I tell
myself no one else can hear him.

7:00 a.m,Myalarmgoes oflzl giveThe Gen-
eral some spinach so he will stop squeaking.
I pretend to go back to sleep while he chews
and rustles.

7:15 a,m,l give up, take a shower and won-
det ifI am enabling the guinea pig by al:
ways giving him spinach to stop the squeak—
ing. Decide that there is no alternative.The
pig always wins.

7:45 am. Have an ice pop for breakfast on
my way to the Grille for coffee.

3:30 am. I wonder if the General squeaks
while I am not around, Do my neighbors
think I am mistreating him? Wonder i€I
can casually raise the topic without appear-
ing defensive.

8:45 a.m.I decide that I think too much

about the guinea pig.

9:00 am. Wonder if my parents would be
really upset if I took the guinea pig home
for fall break and forgot to bring him back.
Am sure they would take good care ofhim,
but afraid that the pig would not miss mco

9:13 ant. I wish I was at the A&M instead
of drawing my shoes. But very happy with
my drawing. I see a glorious career for my
selrin drawing shoes.

11 am, Done with class for the day. I go to
l-‘iberwotks to buy some beads and fabric for
an art bra contest next week. Excitement.

12:15 p.m. Worry that 1 am too excited
about art bus and what it sitys about me.
Surely any reasonable person would be err
cited about art bras. Probably shouldn‘t talk
about it A lot, though. Play iteool, like we
always had art bras at home.

1:15 pm. I take the guinea pig outside to
play. I wish you could train guinea pigs,
They are so darn cure though.

2:00 pm. Take a nap with dreams of spin-
ach art bras. Pretty much occupies the rest
ofmy day.
