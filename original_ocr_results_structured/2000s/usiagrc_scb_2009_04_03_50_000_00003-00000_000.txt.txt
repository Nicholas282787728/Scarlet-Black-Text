How does your upbring-
ing in the Arab world uniquely
shape your perspective on the
conﬂict?

Thar peace can [and] will
exist between jews and Arabs
because we have so much in
common From the Qir'au
and the Old Testament we have
so much in common. As I said
before, the ﬁve pillars of Islam
can easily be reflected in Judar

ism. You know, like sawm [fasting], like giving aims to the poor.

Like prayer—you know Muslims pray ﬁve times a day, we pray

that only on Yom Kippur, the day of atonement, but we pray

three times.'I‘he ptlgtiniagerwe’le supposed to go at least once

a year to Jerusalem for pilgrimage, the same thing as in Mecca,

So there is a lot in common, and as I co 'lstedilym not
saying that I lived fiee like I‘m living in Ameritt From time to
tinie,I have to be caieful, but I know I was tolerated as long as

I lived iindei Islam. I think this ability to cocxtst [can come],

providing that the Arab world can accept an independent Itwr

ish entity in the Middle East.

What is the national mood with regard to iran in Israel?
Good question, There is a lot of fear, a lot of apprchcrr
sron. Israel cannot undertake by itselfany attack on Iran. [Iran
PreSident Mahmoud] Ahmadincjad, his two program would
have been fine if its not combined with the ideology of anni-
hilating [and] destroying the state ofIsrael.That combination,

the Israelis feel, is very dangerous,

\Nould they undertake an attack? I don’t think they can do
it by themselves. But, they ate very frightened by the prolifera-
tion of nuclear weapoirs especially when they have a theocracy
like it is in Iran.That thcociacy can govern an individual to do
certain things in the name ofGod and covei up everything else
crin be dangerous.

W hat do you think the prospect of peace is with the new
right wing government in Isrnel, especially Foreign Minister
Avigdor Lieberman?

Lieberman is an issue But, he is only one minister. It's Nee
tanyahtl And thanyalitl already admitted that he will not do
the mistakes that he did when he was prime minister. So,I
think the prospects are much better because he is also older, and
he is also, let's put it this way, he is also more mature and I think
with the Obama admi stration, he cannot do something that
would upset the Americans.

Why is a post-ethnic and post-racial society in the form
of a one-state solution no longer possible?

Because Israel will no longer be a Jewish state. The Jews
have escaped Etiiupe, have left the middle east and north Afr
rice to have like Egypt, its primary Muslim, you have Muslim
holidays, Iiltn, you have Muslim holidaysThey don't cilll theme
selves Muslim states, but you know, look at the constitution
in Egypt. Number one, the religion rs Islam after the name of
the state. And cvei) state, including Morocco, including Libya,
all these places have at the basis of their state the religion of
Islam.

If the Jews in Israel would allow for a one state solution,
the demography will obliterate the nature and character ofthc
Jewish Statcr Because the Arabs have 3.2 births per fa ly while
the Jews have to In 30, 40 years there will be a majority Arab
and a minority Jews. Ifthat happens and its not solved,you will
have an apartheid state.

Do you feel that settlements, checkpoints, the wall, and
the occupation in general are obstacles to peace?

Yes, they are obstacles to peace, but on the other hand the
Israeli leadership is caught in the middle. As in any state whose
citizens pay taxes, the state is obligated to defend its citizens.

When you have suicide bombing and rainpant attacks likc we
heardjusryesterdayin theWest Bank, ifsuch a thing is ﬁnished
and over with,I think the Israelis miist take offthc checkpoints.
But ifthat is not the case, then you need it to protect the citi-
zens because in the middle of the day in Jerusalem or in Ne-
tanya, ‘boom boom' and children and people in buses and all
that That’s why there are checkpoints.

Israelis are not interested, yoll have to understand, in can—
t‘inuing the conﬂict. They want to have peace. They piay for
peace daily, it's part of their culture. It’s part of the name of
Godipeace, shalom, siilaam. But they are afraid that when you
say salaum it is only ti truce and not really a final truce, that
you cannot really have peace with the rnfrdels. This rs the crux
of the problem, and therefore you need reform and education
to accept the Jewsitlic human beings entitled also to exist in
the world.

What role do you think that the U.S. should take in the
conﬂict?

I think it should emphasize the commonality that exists
between them. What unites them, and what projects, mutual
piojects that they can do together to promote the well being
ofthc Palestinians, and not the leadership of the Palestinians
because those aie coriupt. But the people, the common man of
the stieet, his children, education, health, like Israel is doing in
Israel,

We need a Marshall Plan for the Palestinians. And the Eur
ropoaus have understood that, They say that 4,5 billion dolr
lars have already been allocated. Where do they go to? In the
leaders pockets or go to the people? We in Israel criticize very
much our leadei‘shipsinot one leadership, but leadershrps at
every level, okay, There, they are afraid to ctiticm: we know
that, \ch know what happensle media doesn't talk about it,
But Hamas people have shot Fatah people among themselves,
so we know these things but the media covers up such things

But this is unfortunate because they are divided among
themselves and the people cannot rise up because the leader-
ship and say they don't want this- they say I want to have my
home, I want to have good home. That l-Iamas indirectly, intel-
ligently is buying these people.

Hendrickson
from p. 1

you were so into it," Cheek said.
“Whenever I did something that
maybe mrned out to be snrpid, she was usually present. once
I jumped offa pier because she was like, ‘Let's do itl’I’m really
bad at swimming, and my biggest fear was
drowning, but still."

There are a thousand stories about I’len-
drickson, but one clear consensus emerged:
she loved people, and people loved her.
Danica Radoshevicli ’12 met her in sixth
grade, when Hendrickson was performing
in a production of “A Christmas Carol.”
She saw l-lendriekson on stage and waved
to her. Undetcrred by the ongoing produc-
tion, l'lendrickson waved back.

“I was just like, ‘Oh. I want to be friends
with her,” Radoshevieh said.

Hendrickson brought the same energy to her life at
Grinnell. Before they went out on the weekends, Kristen Mus
maw ’12 and Hendrickson would meet in Mumaw's room and
sing rap songs to each other. For Halloween. Hendrickson built
a pinata costume out of crepe paper and candy/7a dress that
looked surprisingly real, her friends say, until they started catr
ing the candy off her.

“She was likc, ‘Guys, stop it! This is a pieccl It’s not for
coiisumptionlmChcek said while laughing

Brad Gordon ’12 met l—leirdrieksou after a night ofparties,
when he and 15 mutual friends decided [O climb the big tree

What/Imam,”

”She wanled l0 ﬁnd beauty in every-

thing. Her dad said something recently
that character/zed her perfectly/fine
was loo busy living life (0 worry about

on Mac Field. They happened to sit on the same branch, and
quickly exchanged names and phone numbers, For the next
week and a half, Gordon texted Hendrickson regularlyiuntil
she agreed to go on their first date, ii bike ride to Taco Bell

“Whitney wasn’t the kind of pore
son who needed romance thrown in
her face." Gordon said, “She wanted
to ﬁnd beauty in everything. Hcr dad
said something recently that charae
tcrized her perfectlyishc was too
busy living life to worry about what
it meant. "

Gordon and Hondricksonr who
dated for six months before Heli-
driekson's death, spent a lot of their
time just talkingion Gordon's com-
fortable bed. or in the park a few blocks from Norris. They
could joke about anything, Gordon said, even things that other
people would ﬁnd offensive or strange.

“We were constantly berating each other, for lack ofa bet—
ter word," Gordon said. “That's how we worked off each other.
Everything in life was funny."

I-lendrickson did not fight with people much, her friends
said, She didn’t see the point. With a whole world ofcostumes
and rap battles and sunshine to be experienced, she wasn’t one
to waste time on petty differences.

"She was always so aware of how precious things are, wasn't
worried about the future as much its living life for what it was,"

Brad Gordon’iZ

Radoshevich said,“Any time I’d meet up with her, she’d seem to
be enjoying whatever she was doing."

Like all Gtinnell students, Hendrickson wasn’t peifect,
but her friends laugh thinking about it. She was forever los-
ing things, they say, and she was constantly late. If she left
something in a friend's room, it would be theie for weeks, even
months, before they finally forced her to take it back.

“I think she lost five p-cards,” Pbdair said. “She’d lose her
phone, and well go across canrpiis looking for it, and she’d be
like, ‘It might be in this person’s cat from two days ago. Oh,1
don't have the keys, though.”

Even in the midst afhis grief, Gordon is trying to focus on
the best parts of his time with Hendrickson. He thinks about
small moments with lleriv‘lslhlng her after she had ﬁnished
her homework, watching Arrested Development, and witness-
ing her obsession with anew/iiiylpfetoni,

“Whitney just brought so much happiness to my life, and
my entire world centered around making her happy," he said. “It
was my goal to see that smile and hear that laugh every single
day. I can say with all honesty that my biggest achievement at
Grinnell so far was getting Whitney Heudriekson to love me "

A service to celebrate Hondrickson's life will be held on Fir
day, April 3 at 4:30 PM. in Herrick Chapel, with a reception
following in JRC 101. At the service, her friends will be able to
share their favorite memories ofl—lendrickseir and pay tribute
to the girl they say made every day better.

“Of my entire life, so to 90 percent of my most hilarious
days were with her," Radoshevich said.
