Embracing The Vampires—as long as they really suck

Let's get one thing straight: Edward Cul—
len sucks.

Or, to be more clear, I should say he (idir
ornaucally) sucks as a vampire because he

* doesn't literally suck as a vampire, and being a
vampire is supposed
to be all about the
sucking.

To be honest,
l’ve only read the
first “Twrlight” book
and I don’t know
how the rest of the
series plays out.
Maybe Edward becomes more interesting, but
I really don't care to find out.

Vampires are everywhere these days. The
success of Stephanie Meyer’s abstinence alle-
gory, the “Twilight" series, has led to all kinds
ofvampire tales filling the shelves ofrhe teen
sections of bookstores and multiplexes across
the country.

What accounts for the resurgence of The
Vampire these days? Why are they such a big
part of the zeitgeist at this particular moment,
and will their popularity outlast other recent
fads like The Jonas Brothers or the Internet?

The new Vampirism finds its origin, I
think, in “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” Joss
Whedon’s exquisitely crafted seriorcomic
horrorshow soap opera. “Buffy" skillfully ren~
dered the high school-as-Hell metaphor in
its ﬁrst three seasons, and it (along with its
spinoff "Angel") proved that vampires could
be presented with sophistication and serious-

As much as Angel is the hero, it's the souls
less Angelus who steals the show. And nothr
ing compares to the sheerjoy conveyed by the
sublimejames Marstcrs as he transforms from
William the Bloody to William the Bloody
Awesome Ass~Kicking Vampire.

No wonder that, at least with these two,
she became Buffy the Vampire Layer.

The real visceral pleasure of reading or
watching a vampire story comes during the
reveal of the inner monster, and this is where
"Twilight" fails but shows like “Buffy" and
“True Blood"succeed.The Vampire’s masking
builds tension that is supposed to be resolved
when they give in to their darkness and we
give in to our own, not when they show the
chronically-bland Bella that they sparkle in
the sunlight.

Vampires feed off of the blood of living
creatures and have the ability to turn a victim
into a vampire by first sucking the humans

blood and then having that human suck the
vampires blood in return Vampires typically
appear hypcrrattracrive, which allows them to
seduce their Victims, and their method ofgen-
elation means that anybody could potentially
become a vampire,

What makes vampires scary rs their ability
to walk among us undetected, their incredible
physical strength and the fact that they feed
offofthc living to continue to exist as undead.

Also, they're real.

In an age when presidential administra—
tions can gain power by exploiting tragedy and
asking its citizens to shed blood in a war of
choice, when men like Bernie Madoff fatten
themselves on the trust and wealth of their
fellow citizens, when baseball players inject
Human Growth Hormone into their veins
in order to increase their physical prowess,
it’s not hard to see Vampirism
mn amok. We then need to
find answers as to how to
stop it.

We can't help but
wonder if our own necks
are exposed, and whether
our victimization might
mean our untimely end or
our continued existence as one
ofThem. To be a vampire is as
attractive as it is terrifying, and any
good vampire story plays on this ambivalence.

The problem with Edward Cullen is that
he’s not scary, that he doesn’t force us to con,
front his demons or our own.We know that he

is on our side and that we should be on his.
It’s all too easy.

We need vampire stories to present an
alternate world that looks like our own so
that we can learn how to spot the real vain»
pires—political, ﬁnancial, emotionaliwalkr
ing among us.We need a space where we can
safely explore what it’s like to lay our necks
open to the fang, or to admit that what drives
oui obsessions with 24-hour news coverage
of scandals and murders, our need to tune in
to the mindless tragedies ofrealiry television,
our utter complacency in corruption and eats
ploitation is our insatiable desire for the taste
of blood.

We need to know that at the end of the
day we can leave the darkness and walkin the
sunlight, not necessarily to sparkle but simply
to live.

Ultimately, our fascination

with vampires has less to

do with our fear of what‘s

out there than our fear of

what lies within. it's only

by facing that fear that

we can overcome the inner

darkness and come out of the

shadows. We need to watch or

read the vampire tales so that we

can write our own in which we feel
the fangs but choose not to bite.

That would be a vampire story with a
happy ending. That would be a vampire story,
as Buffy might say, that doesn’t suck.

Happy Hallo-what?

retreat?

Grinnellstudents and residents
weigh in on whether or not there is
an age to ditch the ding-dong

By SARAH SHAUGHNESSY

It's Halloween night and the doorbell rings. You go to an-
swer it with a bowl of candy in your arms, expecting a neigh-
borliood assortment of miniature vampires, witches,princesses
and ghosts. Instead, however, you encounter a trio of college
students in hastily assembled costumes in search of some free
chocolate.

Grinuellians, members of both the college and the town,
have mixed feelings regarding a Lrick—or~trearing age limit.
"I think it depends on what you’re trick-ot-Lrean'ng for,” said
Tom Falls, a Saints Rest patron. "I’ve seen college and high
school students going around collecting cans and spare change
for charities, which is completely acceptable.”

Leslie Bean ’13 shares this attitude. ‘1 went trick-or»
treating for cans with my theater group all four years of high
school," she said. Beau admitted that they always collected
candy afterward. ,

This illustrates another trickror-treating philosophyiit is
acceptable to give candy to those who earn it. "I think if you
can pull it off you should go for it,” another Saints Rest patron
said. “I might look a little strange, but if you’re a high school or
college student with a good costume, why not?”

A few others disagreed, feeling that regardless of costume
quality, tnck-or—treacing after high school is inappropriate.
“After about 25, you need to have a small child with you, baby
sitting or something,” says Christian Loggins ’12. “Otherwise
it's a little creepy.”

While trick or treating may have an expiration date—
however variable—Halloween memories do not. “It was ale
ways fun when it snowed on Halloween," Alexa Reynolds,’13,
a native Iowan, said. "But the worst was when your arents
would make you wear snow pants under your costume. think
that may have been the source of some tears once or twice.”

“Halloween isjust a lot of fun,”commentcd a Grinnell res-
ident. “I love the porch decorations and the costumes. 1 think
you can really be any age to appreciate that.”

ijuMl BELLO .

Hallowccnia raging inferno ofwacky cosnimes, candy exn
ploitation and overall trickery that all Grinnellians know and
love. or do they? Halloween is a customary American holi-
day. On Gtinncll’s campus, the average international students
experiences of Halloween range from absolutely none to the
original experience of Halloween when skulls are made from
sugar and citizens believe in ghosts.

Fatemeh Elahi ’12, an international student from Iran, is
among thosewho had never heard ofHalloween for the major-
ity oftheir lives. She discovered it on her first day orscnior year
of high school, which coincidentally happened to be Hallow
son. “I saw them dressing all weirdly," Elahi said. “I didn’t know
Americans dressed like that. I didn’t know about Halloween
at all."

While Elahi had never heard of Halloween, Pavlo Nikos
laidis ’13, from Greece, was familiar with the October celebra-
tion and knew ofonly one holiday in Greece that was remotely
similar to HalloweeniApokries, a carnival where Greeks wear
costumes in celebration of the approaching of Lent. Samrday
will be Nikolaidis‘first Halloween in the United States and he
plans to participate in typical American fashion. “I'll be going
around, exploiting people for candy," Nikolaidis said. “I plan to

go as Tinker Ben,"

South of the border, Mexicans have a completely different
take on Halloween—or rather, the original take on which ours
is a takeroff. "The American version of the Halloween is spun
off the actual Mexican tradition," Pablo Enriqucz—Dunkel ’12,
from Merida, Yucatan said.“We still operate on it.”

Enriquez-Dunkel reﬂected on his past years celebrating
Dia de Los Mucrtos, the Day of the Dead. It is the day where
the dead come back to visit loved ones and their families pre-
pare for their arriml. “In my town’s version, we set up altars—
one for children, one for adults. The children’s altar is usually
colorful, with toys, pictures of dead children," said Enriquer
Dunkel. “You'll put a picture of the kid, candy, toys, stuFf the
kid might have liked.”

Instead of the American collection of commercial candies,
skulls are created from pure sugar with decorations of even
more sugar in different colors.

Despite his native country's history in celebrating the dead,
EnriquleDunkel is intrigued by the American rake on honorn
ing the dead. “The American version ofthe Halloween is spun
off the actual tradition. We still operate on it. [But] it’s one of
my favorite holidays actually" EnriqueZnDunkel said. “I love
how people put so much effort into dressing up.”
