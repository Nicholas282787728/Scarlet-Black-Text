rhe college would need ro hire seven new remporary

servarive esrimaie based on rhe faculry reaching parrerns
ar rhe college over rhe lasr six years. He added rhar rhe
college’s demand for remporary faculry would be even
grearer if rhe new policy encouraged faculry ro reach
more independenrsrudies rhan rhey raughr over rhe pre»
vious six years.

Demand for rempcrary faculry would be grearesr in
the science division followed by the social studies and
rheri the humaniries divisions, corresponding to she

swarrz said rhe faculry have yer ro formally discuss
rhe proposal and rhere ls currenrly no consensus on rhe
issue. However, some professors already oppose rhe pro.
posal.

”Unril we have a larger raeulry, rhe poliey would
srrain rhe curriculum," Mark Monrgomery, professor
of economics and chair of rli: faculry, said, citing (lie

rhar rhe policy change would require. Monrgomery said
he believes fnculry should be compensared with course
releases for independenr srudy during the summer bur
nor during rhe academic year.

The proposal may face furrher opposirion from rhe
Trusrees because hiring more remporary faculry conrra.

The ouesrion ofhoiv ro compensare faeulry for reach»

said he doesn'r expect rhe college ro approve any changes
