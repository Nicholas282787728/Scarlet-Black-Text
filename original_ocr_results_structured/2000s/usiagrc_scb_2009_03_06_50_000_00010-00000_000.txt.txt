20 years, returned to Langan to spend the
weekend, only this time with two kids and
his wife.

With the departure of former RLC Ra-
chcl Meseke this past week, the Larigan RLC
apartment was left vacant posing the ques-
tion of what to do with this prime campus
real estate. Cutchins saw the open apartment
as an opportunity to foster a deeper rclatione
ship with the student body after SGA’s rec
quest for more contact with administrators,
“I thought it was a great way that we could
just be very human and get in the dorms and

The Cutchins gills also spent some time
scoping out the apartment and the dOImKO’

as a paddle ball and plastic hand clappers.
They also discovered the posters that list the
residents’ birthdatcs and were pleased to find
that they shared birthdays with other north-

* Doug Cutchins, hrs wife, Anne Geissrngcr, and therr two
kids, Emma, seven, and Bea, five, had a packed weekend
on campus. They participated in the 150 Cultural fashion

The Cutchins clan even made an appearance in Darby
to cheer on the men’s basketball team in their tournament
game against Lawrence.The girls brought theirAegame and

cookies because it meant they could interact with the “big

Overall, the family felt that the experience was a success,
“It was really about interacting with the students and having
fun with them and I think we definitely did that,"Cutchins
said.

Although no more stays have been officially planned,
the RLC apartment is open for more Student Affairs visits.
When asked ifthey would return the girls responded with a

Grinnell, as intensely academic as it is,
offers a variety of places with different cnvi»
tonments and settings for students to study
in. While many choose quiet
libraries, others find it comt
fortablc to work amidst the
crowd of the Grill. However,
there are other areas on cam-
pus that could be a perfect
setting tor students to study
in, but are absolutely under-
used,

The Black Cultural Cen-
ter (BCC), serving as an air-campus house
for Gina Physic ’11 and Alexis Castle ’09,
has a arudv c with cornpu '5, “lt has

i y s] act for anyone who would

innmeni.”

like to study ‘in a quiet environment," Physic
said. “Although the library needs renovation,
there are many resources available there. If
you want to work on a paper or something,
it’s a good place to work or,"
she said, She also said that the
school needs to advertise the
place more in order for people
to even know that the BCC
has such a nice studying area,

However, places like the
fireplace lounge fly under the
iadar of most students. On

here, they are very comfortable If you are
reading, this is a nice place to be at,"said Liz
Dreler ’11,

But when it comes to hours of working,
Dreier prefers the library because of the re»
sources available thcrc, “When it comes to
doing math problems, I go to Noyce because
of the white boards available there," she said.

Similarly, Andrea Loiscr '11, a circulation
desk monitor at Kistlc, said she goes to Burl-
ing whcn she needs to study for a long time.
“Apart from the fact that there are more re-
sources there.I feel much more comfortable
studying rhere,"slr- aid

seemed to have been “underused" is when
people leave their bags on desks or study
rooms indicating that the area is already “oc—
cupied" and don’t come back for a long time.

While Kistle is bustling with students
and study groups, places like the BCC need
awareness on campus. “One or the reasons,
apart from the lack of awareness, for the
Bcc not having too many students study-
ing in it, is its name," said Physic. “Because
it's called the Black Cultural Ccntcl, many
students who arc not black fccl like they can-
