like the majon'ty or
colleges in the United
States, Grinnell College
seems to have issues
with binge drinking.
Binge drinking, for those
of you who were smoking
in the bathroom during
this particular D.A.R.E.
lecture, is when you
have a number of drinks
in a row (ranging from s
to 12, depending on the
person) with the
intention or becoming
intoxicated, Binge
drinking is a serious
problem and can lead to
alcohol poisoning, loss
of consciousness, weight
gain, catwalk activity
and, in extreme cases,
kissing that prospie with
the weird smell in front
of everybody.

The Harvard School of
Public Health did a study
last year on binge
drinking and found that
almost hair of college
students binge drink at
least once every two
weeks. I did a similar
study this weekend and
found that if you leave a
half-consumed beer
unattended on the floor
in Harris, it will be gone
without a trace by the
time you get back from
the bathroom.

How should we stop this
problem before it gets
out of control? Past
solutions such as looking
after the well being of
your relluw friends,
better adhering to and
understanding the
philosophy behind self
governance and not
drinking so much that
you target the name oi
your roommate but
suddenly remember all of
the lyrics to ”November
Rain” seem to have
failed.

Perhaps if, in place of
binge drinking, students
were to spread their
alcohol consumption
throughout the week we
could combat this
problem. That is, instead
of dnnking, say, 21
drinks on the weekend,
one would drink three
glasses a day. This would
translate to a glass or
wine with dinner and
two shots of vodka right
before econ,

Of course, this solution
comes with its own kinks
and problems. For
instance, it will be all
the more difﬁcult to do
things like drown your
sorrows, forget you are
in the middle of Iowa,
lose your equilibn‘um, or
repeatedly confess to
that girl you always see
in the loggia that you
think she has a nice
rack. Not to mention
that it will be impossible
to get through econ on
just two shots.

Turn it on and get turned on

“Equal Parts of Boredom" brighten up monday afternoons with indie rock and a talented DJ

by Jenni Wu
Stuff erier
“You can't help whar
rurns you on," rciids rhc
disclaimer [0 the Show
manned by DJs Hung
thm and Adam Smith,
Perhaps nor. bur rhose
wirh an amniry for, whnr Smirh described as, “wirry onenii baiircr,
technical prowess and reﬁned taste in music.”‘will dcnnirely rccl rhc
glow of“Tum You On," which airs every Sun-
day from 6,8 p.m. In seeking to deﬁne rhc
Show, Smith claimed “Our theme song would
probably be ‘Cool Like Thu.’ by the Digablc
Planets, though that might hurt our indie cred,"
m which Phim counrcred. “Oh yeah. I dig
‘Cool Like Thar,’ and cvcryrhing, bur no way
in hell is ir our theme song."

With a combined nine semesters of KDIC experience berween
them, the two veteran DJs have courted audiences since the begin
ning ufrheir Grinncll careers. ”Hung and I were both interested in
doing shows our ﬁrst year. I guess we wcrc just rslkiiig snd rhc idea
came rogerlicr. We weren’t really friends sir rhe iimc, really. i rhink
l inirnily hgurcd neirher or us could ger our own shows," remcme
burud Smirh. “Hung pin up ivirh rhc facr rharl insisted on playing
Morrissey every so oticii, andl rhink he likes rhe idea othaving a
bitch, or or leasr someone he can drop science on," he explained at
rhe duo's successful rapporr. ”For his parr, Adam purs up wirh rhc
facr rhar l insist on playing ‘Here's Where rhc Srory End:’ by rhc
Sundays as our closing song For each show. Also, he makes me
sound like a music Snob, which l’m not," Pham added.

“We don’t do gimmicks,
we just spin discs"

Running rhc show has nor been wirhour its bcnehrs. “it's just
cool to pl ay music and sheer the shir wirh someone for two hours.
Having people call up and say rhey like what youre playing ncver
hurrs, cirhcr, exp lained Plum. For Smith, one or rhc best parts
abour being a KDIC D] has been the ladles. We wouldnr be the
DickiccAward-Winning producrion rhar we at: wirheur our tans."
However, borh confessed ro minor blotchcx on rhc pair's illustrious
career. “Hung curscs a lot and has these really humiliating bouts of
gas, bur 1 cover tor him. We've done all rhe ciasric shit like playing
two songs sir once or broadcrsring nothing but silence for a while,
bur such incidents are few and tar bcrwecn,"
cited Smith.

”Adam usually runs rhc equipment, so
blame all the technical ﬂubs on him. Also, i
do not have gas, My chair iusr cranks, hon,
csr," said Pham in his defense.

or rhe Shaw’s conrcnr, Pham said, “Twee‘
pop is dchnircly our calling card, burwe play
other arurr, [00. Lot: othiphup and aircrnorivc rock in all in ﬂa-
vars. Back in rhc day, we used is rcaily focus on playing an cclccric
mix ormusic. Bur now, not so much." While Smirh saw “Frecstyling”
in rhc immediare future or“TurnYou on," he mainnined rhe show's
focus on music, as "We don’t do gimmicks, we just spin discs." As
for rurrher down rhc road, Smirh foresaw, “l’vc got another year or
i<DiC letr in me, rhough i doubt I'll work wirh music in rhe rurure.
Someday, I’ll have us ger a iraljbb is support ihc kldx and my harem,"
Pham, tor rhc most part, seconded Smith's predicriun, all “cxcepr
tor rhc hsucm parr.”

S: You're a prerenrlbus bnsrard. I really liked LA.
comma/clinic one IS easier ro follow, bur ir didn’t
always go rhe way i rhoughr it was going to be,

Dancer in rhe Dark
F: l—icrc's whnr i knew abour
this movie going into it: ir srnrs
lcelandic pop sensation brork. She
won best actress at Cannes, and
rhc movic won rhc Palmc D’Or
(big huge pri’le) ar that formal. She plays a Czech
immigrrnr and single mom who is going blind, and
working very hard to gcr an opernnun for her son,
who has the same genetic, uh, rhiiig. And lore and
lors or bad srufr happens to her, and the ending isii'r
ham
S This movie is messed-up lrs depressing :is hcll,
and it's gar musical scenes in ii.
F Yeah. Byork lives formusic and it obsessedwirh
musicals. So she daydreams songcnnd-dancc num-
bers. i guess the polnt is rhaicven though she’s going

blind, she can imagine happiness. I rhink ir works,
because it's abundanriy clear (by an incrcssc in color
saturation and by rhe way rhc numbers end) that rhc
peoplcarcnr really singing and dancing, shes just image
ining ir.

S. The whole rhing is ﬁlmed digiraily, and looks
prcrry washed—our, which is hrring, sincc ir keeps pil»
mg on horrible rhings tor this poor woman. Appar-
cnriy rhc director made things so hard on Bjork rhar
she never wants ro act again.

F: Which is roo bad, Sock. bemuse she's really rcr.
rific. All rhe acrors (including Coen Bros. hvorire Perer
Srormare and classic French-ﬁlm horric carhcrine
Dcnauvc) are quire naturalistic. They talk like real
people rather than a scripr, and the hand held (and,
again, low to video givcsthe impression that rhe ﬁlm
makers are just moving cameras around in these
peoples lives.

3: Which are bigger downer: than theVikings’ rc.
ccnr post-seasons, and much less realistic

F: Well, Sock, when
I watched ir i just sort
