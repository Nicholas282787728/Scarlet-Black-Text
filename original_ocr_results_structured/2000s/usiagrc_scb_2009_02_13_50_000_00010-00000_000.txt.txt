Security Officer- Put Rum ’08 an Ear! Campur.

There and back:

BYTORREY MACGREGOR

For many Gtinnell students, the prospect ofleaving the Lib—
eral arts nest is daunting to say the least. Against the backdrop
of a waning job market and economic instability, many may
start to wonder, “This road to a place of endless possibilities »
where exactly is it taking me?” For Pat Ritter ’08, the answer is
right back to Grinnell College.

Raised in Waterloo, Iowa, the current Safety and Security
Officer for the College served in the Marine Corps for four
and a halryears before enrolling at crinnell as a
ﬁrst-year. An English-turned-political science
major, and former sports Editor of the soda,
Ritter alvmys envisioned a career not far from
his roots, “I'm from Iowa originally and my
wife has ajob in Des Moines, so we're kind of
anchored here,” Rittet said.

After graduation last May, Ritter took some
well-deserved time offbefore beginning his job
hunt. “Everybody who leaves Grinnell should
take some time off," Ritter said. “Gtinnell is very demanding,
obviously, and it can burn you out."

For Ritter, though, working in a familiar environment
proved to be a good fit, Having seen a listing on the Grinnell
College website, he felt that working for the Security Office
would be a job he was both interested in and qualiﬁed for, with
his military background.

Another major inﬂuence on Rittct‘s decision to return to
work at Grinnell involved the character of the students. “I re
member from when I was a student here that we had a pretty
good relationship between students and security relative to
what goes on at a lor ofcollegcs,"hc said.

Ever the true Gtinnellian, Ritter cited his desire to have a
positive impact on the way Security works here. “I felt that if I
could make the transition, that it would be a good way to be in-
volved in the community and help stridentsil‘Rittcr said. “Most

ofwhat we do is helping students,"

Although he enjoys his job, Ritter said that it has been a
little strange being a security officer so soon after graduating.
“The weirdest part about being here now is that I don't know
anybody from when 1 was a student you realize how much
of a dynamic thing it is, and how the only things that stay here
are the buildings," Rittet said. “students come and go so quick
lyia lot of the traditions stay the same and it’s still the same
Gtinnellibut with an entirely new set of faces."

While some students may be reluctant to
approach a Security Ofﬁcer, Ritter insists that
his concerns are not focused on getting stu-
dents in trouble. “It’s tough in that, I mean, you
just want to take care of the students,” he said.
“I know that Student Affairs is really interested
in keeping the students educated abour helping
each other,"

Ritrer’s presence has leant an air of youth
to the group of Safety and Security Officers on
campus, something that students and dispatchers alike point
out as a positive way to facilitate communication between stun
dents and the Security Ofﬁce on campus, "It’s nice to have
someone who actually has some perspective on being a student
or who knows what we're going through," said Maia Olsen ’11.
“It's refreshing that there's someone younger on the security
sratfbecause they're closer in age to us and they don’t necessar-
ily have the same authoritarian role as maybe an older officer
would,like a patent-child thing.”

Ultimately, Rmet hopes that by being here, he will help stir
dents feel safe while doing what he lovesitalking to people. “If
I‘m out hcre talking to students, I’m actually doing myjob
just being seen, so people know that Security is around and that
if they have problems they can talk to us," Ritrcr said. “\bu’re
like, wow, I get paid for this."

recipes you (probably) won’t mess up

or friends. That's all you‘ll need for these two recipes (plus
maybe a dishtowel or washcloth to use as potholdcr),

There are all kinds of arguments about what constitutes a
healthy diet, and since I spent most of high school nutrition
class writing a spy novel, I'm not going to try to dictate the

ideal diet. However, most people
agree that vegetables are good for
you, and in light ofthat.l offer two
easy vegetable recipes that require
, no specialized equipment or cook-
ing talent, just the aforementioned
sharp knife and pot with a lid.

Yes, these recipes make too much
for a normal person to eat in a single sitting. You can invest in
some Tupperware or eat with your friends.

Recipe 1: Glazed Carrors

lfyou don’t like glazed carrots, you clearly had some kind
ofchildhood trauma. These will help ease that pain. For this,
you’ll need: 3 cups water, 5 tablespoons butter, 3 teaspoons
sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, and 2 pounds carrots. Peel the carrots
(knife or vegetable peeler) and slice rhcm into 1-inch chunks.
That's about the width of two fingers. Put everything into

the pot, and put the pot on the stove on high. Cook, cow
ercd, for about 7 minutes. Then remove the lid and cook until
rhe carrots reach the tenderness you prefer (generally about 5
minutes). Drain and serve hot. Increase the sugar if you like
sweeter carrots.

Recipe 2: PanrRoasted Broccoli

I know lots of people hate broccoli. Frankly, I'm not the
biggest fan ofsreamed broccoli. This is different. You need a
head of broccoli, 2 tablespoons ofvegetable oil, l/r teaspoon of
salt, and 3 tablespoons of water, Cut the broccoli into bite-
sized ﬂorets, and then peel about Vi inch offthe stalk (it's dcli-
cious) and cut it into ‘4 inch slices. Heat the oil in a pot or
pan on medium until it shimmers and add the broccoli stalks
evenly. Cook without stirring for 2 minutes. Add the ﬂorets,
stir, and cook without stirring for 2 minutes more. Sprinkle
with salt and then add the water, covering immediately. Cook
2 minutes more. Uncover and cook until broccoli is crisp but
tender, about 1 or 2 minutes. Serve with lemon or butter or
both.

Recipe for Pan-Roasted Broccoli is from Carib Illultmtrd.
