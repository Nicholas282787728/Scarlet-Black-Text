campus news

 

 

 

A miscommunication between different administrative offices
apparently led to recent confusion over the STATUS OF THE FORUM
NORTH LOUNGE, which is likely to remain unavailable to student groups
for the rest of the semester. The Office of the Registrar and Ofﬁce of
International Studies shared the space throughout the 2001-02
academic year after the demolition of their former homes to make way
for the Chrystal Welcome Center. With the new center’s completion,
the Registrar left the room, but International Studies, slated to move
to Mears Cottage, has remained in the lounge awaiting the complete
remodeling of Mears, despite assumptions from some members of
Student Affairs that the lounge would be emptied after fall break. In
the meantime, a glut of student activities this week pushed several
events into odd locations like the south gym of the Physical Education
Complex, which will house today's blood drive. Dean of the College
Jim Swartz, who has overseen the juggling of campus offices during
recent construction, said the college would do its best to complete
the move as soon as possible . . . The ongoing CAMPUS STRATEGIC
PLANNING process has been divided into eight broad topics for
exploration, each of which will be adressed at a trio of all—campus
open sessions to be held in the next two weeks. Grinnellians can discuss
student life, social commitment, and community enhancement at 7
pm. on Thursday, Nov. 14, in ARH 102; faculty and staff and instruction
at 4:15 p.m. on Monday, Nov. 18, in ARH 302; and facilities, external
relations, and ﬁnancial balance at 7 p.m. on Thursday, Nov. 21 in ARH
302 . . . The secondrtorlast of this semester’s SEA-SPONSORED VAN
TRIPS will leave the Forum parking lot at 10 a.m. tomorrow for
downtown Iowa City and the Coralville Mall, and return by 6:15 p.rri.
Reservations on the two 15rpassenger vans must be placed today by
1:15 p.m. at the Forum desk . . . Four dining services directors from

colleges around the Country will visit the College's food outlets
sometime in the near future as part of a PEER REVIEW OF GRINNELL'S
DINING. At unannounced times, they will visit the dining halls,
restaurants in town, and the Grinnell House . . . Campus cash from the
PIONEER ONE-CARD may be accepted at some businesses around the
city of Grinnell in the next year or two. Readers for the card, which
cost around $5000 each, may be difficult for small businesses to afford,
and administrators are discussing the amount of assistance the college
would be willing to provide for the installation.

Joint Board minutes will now be available late each Week on the web-
based Plans community. Users should ﬁnger [SGM]. . . Next Mondays
Joint Board will consider a resolution Calling for the RE-EXTENSION
0F FORUM GRILL HOURS into the wee hours of weekend mornings.
Advocates say it would provide a gathering place for students interested
in non-alcoholic events; critics argued Monday that it would place
unreasonable demands on Grill employees, particularly student
managers. . . Senators overwhelmingly approved six separate
AMENDMENTS TO THE SEA CONSTITUTION Monday. Along with a few
minor rewordings of the document, the changes would remove the ban
on students on academic probation serving as senators and subject
senators who miss more than two JB meetings to impeachment rather
than outright removal. Each proposal must now be ratified in a
referendum by 60 percent of the student body and signed by college
president Russell Osgood. . . STUDENT INITIATIVES are due next Friday,
Nov. IS. Forms are available in the SGA offices. Students can propose
intiat'ives on any topic.

correction

In our Nov. 1 issue, an article on the antivwar movement at Grinnell
incorrectly stated that the Grinnell Antirwar Alliance was formed directly
out of a meeting of the Radical Students Collective. Though the groups
have worked together to coordinate demonstrations against militaly
action in Iraq, the ﬁrst Alliance meeting was not organized under the
auspices of the Collective. The sad regrets this error.
