Last November and
the minimum wage

“Have you voted yet?l.>l>l" lfyou heard that more than once
or twice (or ten times) during the months of October and No»
vember 2006,1’m sorry It probably wasn’t me asking you each
of those times, but 1 can assure you 1 had something to do with
it.

In this column,1 try to make up for whatever inconvenience
that oucstion might have caused you by talking about what we
achieved together last November. And I don't just mean that
we got people elected or that we
“threw the bums out" or anything
quit: so superficial or ephemeral.
Herc,l plan to document the things
our government is actually doing
for peopleiftom the courthouse
in Montezuma to Capitol Hill.

It's not always glamorous, and
it's seldom perfect. But it's wottli talking about nonetheless,
because too often it goes unnoticed.

For instance, the week that President Bush proclaimed his
urge to surge (by increasing troop levels in Iraq back up to the
level that they were already at a year ago, when we were still
losing), the US House passed a bill increasing the minimum
wage to $7.25 per hour. Unless you make an effort to seek out
political news,you wouldn't have licartl about it,

And you almost certainly would not have heard that, in that
same week, both houses of the lowa legislature passed a simi-
lar minimum wage increase, and that Governor Chet Culver-
signed it into law. Our new State Represciitatiiic, Erie Palmer,
was the only freshman in the town House invited to speak in
support otthe measure.

However, rt rhc Democrats had really wanted to improve
conditions for workers for good, they would have added a pro-
vision to index our minimum wage to inﬂation, or to increase
it by a certain percent each year in perpetuity. They didn’t, and
this was mainly t’oi political reasons: big businesses like Dairy

Smo

Chase Mart n'07

Queen were strongly opposed to any automatic increases Big
businesses have a lot of money, and Democrats don’t want all
that money to be used to defeat them in 2008.

But don’t let your cynicism get the best or you here, be
cause raising the minimum go is still a big deal. This was
the ﬁrst increase in the ini imurn wage in a decade, and 89
percent ofAmcticaiis support it, A workingrclass family could
now earn an average of 54,400 more per year , enough to pay
some health care costs, start a child's
college hand, or buy the family's first
computer.

And il in another few years the
Democrats get to campaign on a
minimum wage increase again, that
can't be all bad,

So think about the contributions
we made the next time you watch or read the news Remember
that the Democratic National Convention's top priority for ins
cumbcnt protection was Leonard Boswell, and that the number
one pickup opportunity for Democrats in the Iowa House was
the seat now held by Eric Palmer.

Grinnell College students were a major force behind both
Boswell’s and Palmer’s successes. It's easy to forget, but we
shouldn’t, hecause we really did help mrkc it happen.

In the coming weeks, this column will become signiﬁcantly
less opium ic and noticeably more cynical. t can only hold
on on talking about crazy Republican Presidential candidates
for ii little while longei,1 suspect, as they persevere down what
Sam Bmwnback calls the “yellow-brick road" towards Pennsyl-
vania Ave. (And given the way things usually work, Democrats
will probably start making some notcworrhy mistakes here and
there. too.)

In short,1 hope not always to bore you. For a preview ofan
upcoming column, google “Tom Taneredo" and “Team Ameri-
ca." The results may surprise you.

On a Minimum Wage Increme

“I believe we should do it in a way that does not punish the
millions of small businesses that are Creating most of the new
jobs in our country. So I support pairing it with targeted tat and
regulatory relief to help these small businesses stay competitive
and to help keep our economy growing.”

—Prcsident George W. Bush, 12/21/06

“It has been nearly 10 years since Congress raised the minimum
wage, President Bush has repeatedly blocked any increase.
And that speaks volumes about how out oftouch he is With the

needs ofwotklng Americans.“
—SenatolTomI'Iarkjii,1/31/07
