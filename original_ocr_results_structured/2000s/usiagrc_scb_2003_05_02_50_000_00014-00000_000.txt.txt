Article response

Deer Editor,

I reed with lnlc|ﬁfr then bewilderment end hnelly greet sorrow
your recent ertrcle entitled “A different kind oriaduodtion" byMicheel
Andersen, the news direetor of the we}. The interest, orcourse was
driven by the subject mutter, while the bewilderment was due to
dubious reporting. Esemples orthis include; but ere not llmlrcd to
the following

“nauti when et two in the morning or et ten et night, tenlcs end
bulldozers come into their cities and mid e bunrh ofhomes end beet
e bunch of people up . . , i den undersrend it someone wents to
defend that city."

This quote gives the impression thet the IDF rendomly etteeles
Pelestinien hornet However, nothing could be rerther irorn the truth,
The destruction oi the homes is a direct result or the lsreelr polrey
thet rtrnrlies who support homicrde bombers will lose their house.
To avoid the destruetron ofrhcir houses ell rhtt would heve to hop
pen is for the homicide bombing of rnnoeent women end ehildten
to be stopped,

The nest instenee or bio reporting occurred when Andersen tee
lryed Krertowri-r's view of Pelestinren housing:

“Knitowitr's spceks more quietly when she tellts about the ﬁrst
time she sew the houses in men. They're like these big ugly grey
cement hosts with rebet sticking out orthe top wertrng hit the next
ﬂoor to be built, she said These ugly grdy boxes seem to be these
symbols ordertence, ornsistenee in the most besie wey And there
are e lot otthings like that in Pelestine ‘

The poor infrastructure in both the West Bank end Gare strip
ere the direct result ore eorrupt Pelestinien leadership who choose to
use aid money to line their own pockets and pay homicide bombers,
tether then burld sehools, sewers end lronres,Taleing Krertowri-r's logic
to its logitel eonelrrsion would result in the etgument thet Palesnnt
ien eorruption is in ttselre symbol ordenenee and resistance

But the questionable reporting does not stop there. In a phone
interview with Krartowitt's, Audersen reports: “Tom Hurdall, e Brit.
ish [SM activist who wes shot in the heed nvo weeks ago while trying
to help a pelestinien women ind her child escape isreeli gunnro.
Hurdell is now breindeed end lying in en israoli hospitel."

From this eetount you might get the unprosion thet Herdell
was shot by the [DP when in Feet he was shot by Palestinien gun.
men Moreover, es e non tombetent he should not heve been in the
eree. Remember it is the Palestinian inilitery who lreve edopted the
strettgy orhiding emong the civiiien populetion

Frnelly, my sorrow \V:ls the result that my sehool wes esperieno
ing the anurlsmell rhetoric thet is so prevelent in some or the best
tollegos end universities in Americe. 0n severel occasions. Andersen
end Kreitowite mike homicide bombing end the Holoeeust as well
es the eetions orthe lDF morally equivelent. 1 rerer to the i'ollowing:
“It's myobligation tosey no, this ean'tbedonein my neme. .. irlews
in Europe htd Ind more people hiding them, more peoplespeeking
out, any one spetking out, [the Holoteustl wouldn t have lreppened

And when at two in the morning or at ten et night, tanks and
bulldozers come into their titres end reid e bunch orhomes end beat
a bunch of people up. I een understand irsomeone wents to defend
thereity"

To equate the policlu orthe lDF with homieide end then eornr
pert the homicide bombers with murder ore million people, 15
million children, is both rnorelly reprehensible end indefensible.
Moreover, 1 would likeAndersen end Kntftown-e to cxplnln how the
killing oriews et e seder dinner or the sleuglrtcr of teens at e pt-ersr
restturent helps defend e city in care,

Petheps Andersen's article would be e better ﬁt tor the opinion
section rather then the news section es the erriele wes far more opin»
ion then news. However, all i know is thet es Grinnellienswe should
know better end epply more intellettuei rigor to our work.
