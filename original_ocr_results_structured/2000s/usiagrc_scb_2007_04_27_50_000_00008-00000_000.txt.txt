Picking rip Inwlltary by visual artist Amos
Goldbarrm ’07 feels almost like perusing his
personal sketchbook. The 120 pen and ink
sketches of everything from hamburgers to
horned creatures are rendered in purple ink
and crowded onto the page without comments
or captions, inviting the book’s audience to in-
terpret snippets from the artist's imagination.

Iziwnlozy marks the third release for the
founders and sole employees of the SPARC-
funded Press Publications, Mdc Pohanka ’08
and David Barnctr'os, and exhibits the young
organization's continuing tradition of produc»
ing offbeat and original publications.

Loosely divided into sections, Goldbaum's
eyercarching images seem ro slowly slide and
spill into each other. Inventory represents a bye
btid between Goldbnum's predilection towards
presenting his artwork through the personal
space of his sketchbooks and Press Publicatiun's
dedication to creating bound books. “In the
end,1 thought [the title] Inventory summed it
up because part of is notjust about catalogue
ing things, part of it is inventive fantasy work,”
said Goldbaum. His sketches convey this sense
of conflarion, gallivanting in between reality
and fantasy, mechanical and organic forms and
ecological spheres and urban landscapes.

Since its inception at the end of Pohnnka
and Barnett’s first year, Press Publications has
always aspired to create a liaison between idior
svncratic stutlenr art and publishing, while also
allowing both Pohanka and Barnett to experir
inent in a pie professional endeavor

“Both Mac and I had this desire to print
and be involved in publications, wrapped with
the possib' 'tics of print as a medium and an
art form, and we didn't feel like there were any
outlets on campus," said Barnett. “we came
up with this big plan to make this microcosm
publication company that would function on

A

-,l

campus. We had [intended] to do a magazine
that would feature a bunch of people. a bunch
of our friends that were writers or artists, but
instead we found Aaron [Bernstein 'Oél's work,
which ended up being our first publication. It
was basically a novella length, a shorr story
with thirty pages. We thought it would make
a really good standralone publication."

That book, entitled fruit Octagon, not only
tested and demonstrated Pohanka ‘and Bar—
nett's pragmatic acumen, but also established
the organization‘s dedication to a distinct aes-
thetic. “Withjnrll Dulllgmi, one ofthe main el-
ements was that it was 21 vignettes that didn't
really have an order we would move away
from some ofthc publications that had already
been on campus and do something in terms
ofstructure and design that was conceptually
differcrit,"said Pohnnkni

Released in the spring semester of 2005,
the handrbound Joi- Ottrlgmz, winch mrght
be best described as a ﬂipbook, established the
organization's interest in the unconventional,
Pohanka said that was the duo's first and only
venture into the timereonsuming process of
hair 'nding. “It took a team of kids getting
paid in cigarettes and pizza about a rveek to
bind 500," he said

However, the release of the Grin/tell Cur
lt'limy Survival Coo/weal: their second pub-
lication by another Grinncll graduate, Paula
Forbes '06, Poll‘anka and Burnett's emphasis on
the cutting edge moved towards a more acces»
sible,btrt nonetheless creative, piece ofrvriring
“We wanted to show that we weren't inst about
artsy prose. we had done this abs . ,rrrcted
ibly rvellrwrrtren novella, but it was nonetlrer
less lll'll|i(’gdl(lb, something that pee} on
campus might have trouble relating to," said
Barnett. “We’re not trying to ma zrnes, but
we’re also irot trying to be esoteric."

Snow White like you ’ve never seen her

Mainstage dance performance reinterprets movement, grief and fairy tales through new choreography

BY LAWRENE SuMuLoNc

oftrnwavering inertia.

Much like the dual wave-particle char-

vcrsions is that [fairy tales] become j

ust for children, cleaned

“It’s much like a carnival telling rhe story rather than char
acters," said Celeste Miller, describing her newest production
Snow White Returned, which she wrote, choreographed and
directed. Her statement is an apt appraisal of the panoply of

dances that Will be performed this weekend in Flanagan The: ,

atet during Bari, Grinnell college’s spring dance Mainsrage
performance. Featuring new choreography by Shannon Ede
wards ‘07 (ream nySI/Mnmrtry), professor Shawn Womack, Art
(Bartram/cc), and visiting performance artist Miller (Snow While
Rely/med), their distinct visions create an exquisite triptych that
strikes at various emotional registers.

Danced to an industrial and austere electronic soundtrack,
Edwards’s piece, rnre/ [Ulrf/irbemirlry, approaches dance and
movement through a scientific but nonetheless poetic lens.
Orbiting each other through a series of weightless movements,
the dancers appear to shift from frenetic states into moments

aeteristrcs of light, dancers have a personal-physical duality,"
said Edwards.“This dance moves between the simplc,scicntifrc
world and the complex, personal world,"

The idea of chemistry subtly radiates from the movements
in Bath/wit. Womack, who choreographed Earl's/wit: in 1999
but testaged the work for four members of Grinnell College's
dance troupe, sets her piece to the third movement ofclassical
Polish composer Henryk corecki's Syria/teeny N0, 3, 0pm 36,
Syrup/awry amel'a'wﬁ/l Stings, which addresses the relati nship
between a mother and a dead child. lmbued with a prayerrlikc
atmosphere with an empathetic feeling as expansive as a cather
dral, Batkrllwke portrays bodies movrng and meditating on loss
and renewal.

Concluding the progmm is SVW‘IU Willie Reunited, a unique
display of danecrtheatet that presents a retelling of the snow
White story. “[What] happened in the history of the movie

up, sterilized, fixed,” said Miller. “And in addition to the tidying
that happens, stereotypes are dmwn...so what I’m interested
in is retracting, taking back the tale,” said Miller. The dance
embarks on its magical realistjorrrney through a discontinuous
narrative comprised of a myriad of scenes. Filled with mor
rrrcrrts of song, dance and spoken word, Sliaw While Reunited
delights in a playing-cards aesthetic, indicated boldly by shades
ofrcd, black and white on each ofrhe 14 characters' costumes.
The productions use otdifrerent modes ofcomniunication
and language, which Miller said questions “how we can move
forward into maturity in a youth culture," speaks to a prevailing
social issue. “were branded by Hollywood,” she said. “Especialr
ly how women are supposed to.be, there's a specific age we are
allowed to be young, an age that were allowed to be sexual, and
an age range in which we are to become invisible. And I think
the Snow White story encompasses a lot of [those issues]."

Student films unleashed at Titular Head

or PAULA MATALLANA AND REBECCA
PARK

His first frlrnmaking experience was at Boy
Scout Camp Then some of the footage got
leaked to the Internet. Now the latest film by
Dan Blees ’10 will premiere at Titular Head,
Grinnell’s own Cannes without the multimilr
lion dollar distribution deals or, some would
argue, the class.

Begun as a live theatrical event, Titw
lar Head evolved into the short film festival
it is today in the late 19805. While the skits
morphed into frve—minrrtcrorrless videos. the
booze and boos never left the building, The
vocal reactions ofthc cncr ally drunk audience
continue to characterize the cvcnt,ovciscen by

a panel of Judges that includes sea members,
raculty. RLcs, and hopefully beloved dining
hall supervisor Lyle bauman.

Like all great art,Titular Head films earn
respect when they speak to the audience; in this
case, that calls for probing the inner depths of

college life. Dan Neely '09,rl member of thc
thtccrpctson committee that organizes the
festival, explained that for submissionstto be
popular “[t]hey have to be funny and involve
Grinnell themes, sexual themes, or alcoholrrcV
lateti themes."

Blecs contributed one ofthosc submissions
this yeal and, keeping with Titular tradition. it
is sincerely silly. It's a superhero movi ,whcr-c
one member of a crirncfrglrting duo is killed

and his partner, traumatized by the experience,
gets in touch with his dark inner self. The
film fits into the offbeat comedy genre Blccs
has been developing since he first tasted tame
when his tapes satirizing his Boy scout patrol
leader elections found a following on the In»
ternet. "Then I get liere,‘Vl/hat? Film festival!’
and I basically had to make one,"lie said.
While the ridiculous tone ofTitulnr Head
movies is generally embraced, the rowdy nudi-
cnce response provokes mired feelings. Blccs
admits that the rampant incbriation reduces
prc e, but he would appreciate more
con ructrve reaction than merely critical, “1
mean, the tree of the event is still go
ing ro get my video out in the open, seen by

people," he said, but I prefer that it be in a
sober atmosphere."

Neely, however, sees it all as part ofa hale
lowed tradition. “It really brings the campus
together, there's a lot of solidarity,” he said.
“Everyone's here, we make a few videos, and
we're all laughing together. It’s a really fun
event.”

Wharcvcr rhc arguments for or against
the current program, it is unlikely to change
anytime soon. conor McGee '08, the leader
ofthc festival committee, explained his role as
taskrnastcr, ensuring the event runs smoothly,
not tilstcnrtilker “I think it's really important,"
he sa' “for the Titular Headmand here I'm
