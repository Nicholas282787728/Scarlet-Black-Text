Joseph, who enrolled at the school last year, led the Permian
High School basketball team to the state playoffs, emerging
as one of the most promising teenage players On the team.
But there's one problcmil'le's not a teenager. Authorities
say that the 22-year-old has been posing as a 16-year-old
sophomore all year, with none the wiser until three Florida
basketball coaches recognized the 2007 Dillard High School
graduate last month. “Everyone just thought he was a big
gory," Permian senior football player Steven Pipes said. Joseph
has been jailed on fraud charges and faces a maximum ofsix
months in jail.

SGA calls for gender-neutral mission statement

BVJ. FRANCis Bush

In their final act ofthe selnester,]oint Board hopes to make
Grinncll a more accepting institution by encouraging change
at the mostbasie level: by updating the College's mission stator
merit to be gender—neutral.

on May 12, Joint Board passed a resolution proposed by
Administrative Coordinator Ethan Struby '10 calling for the
College’s mission statement to use gender-neutral language rue
stead of diction that enforees the gender binary. The specific
phrasing that SGA called to change involved the words “men
and women” in the context, “The College pursues that mission
by educating young men and women in the liberal arts through
free inquiry and the open cxchnnge ofideas" and “The college
aims to graduate women and men who can think clciirly,"itcr
cording to the Joint Board agenda for May S.

“I noticed the mission statement reads ‘men‘ and ‘women;

and that bothered me a little bit. I'm comfortable identifying as
a male, but I know a lot otpeople at this College, some ofmy
triends, don't like usmg erthcr ofthose categories," Struby said.
“It seems likc that should be reﬂected in the mission statement,
particularly since the mission statement talks about diversity,"
According to struby, the prerogative ofchangrng rlre iniSr
sion statement can come from the president’s office. Due to

President Russell K. Osgood's forthcoming departure in July,
the push for a change in the mission statement would likely
come from incoming President Raynard Kingtun.

Regardless of hrs power, Osgood supported the general
idea ofthe resolution and saw it as feasible.

“The current mission statement is in part drawn from the
precise language or the original charter of the College,” Osr
good said, referring to the over 150—yeur-old statement that
brought the then lowa College to life. “I think the gender
terms on it are not exactly as they were in the original lane
guagc, and so I think that is somethrng that could be changed."

Osgood added that changing the mission statement is
no simple task. When the mission statement was updated in
2002. a faculty cuniiiiittcc drafted the document, which was
then approved by faculty and the Board oanrstees.

Furthermore, Osgood said there are certain phrases, viewed
by the Trustees as “magic," that the Trustees would never
ehangc.These phrases do not include gendered language,

“Students who are prepared in life and work to rise
their knowledge and their abilities to serve the common good,’
That’s magicithat will not be changed.” Osgood said, reading
the mission statement. “But you’ll notice it’s not the gender
language."
