Financial aid, cont. from p. 1

This new system would not reduee the total amount orhnanelal ard
alloeated to international students. It would simply eoneentrate the aid on
a select group or npplrmnrs. The committee would deny admrssron to
students with moderate qualrheations who would not be able to atrotd
tuition, and grant adnrission to wealthier, “hill—pay" applicantswho, though
still “qualiﬁed," may be hrrrher from the top orrhe applicant pool.

with the money saved by admitting more Fullepay ourdidates, the
college eould arrord to woo the most academieally qualiﬁed appllanrs by
offering them more aid. Stub believes that diesehool
ean afford to go needesensitive without diluting the
overall quality otinternatlonal students beeause in
the last ten years, the number ormternatronal ape
pllcanrs has tripled, resulting in a mneh larger pool
or highly qualiﬁed sandrdates

l—le elarms that even rrrhe college denies admis-
sion to some highvnccd students who are nearer to
the top of the pool, it still has many very quallrred
candidates to choose trom.

Part or the issue ls mat rnternatronal students.
on average, need mueh more ﬁnancial aid than their
domestic counterparts. Erin Sinogba '05, from the
Philippines, :xplained that there are many issues for _
internnrional students that other students don't have to worry about.

Travel :xpensts, tor one, add up. Sinogba anticipates spending over
$2000 per year on travel alone. Also, the standard ofliving and the eosrs
or rood and other necessities is much higher In the us. than in many
other eountries. Moreover, international applicants do not qualify for fed-
eral aid or loans.

Currently, the admissions eornmrttee evaluates international candle
dates the same way that it evaluates domestic candidates, that is, wlrhuur
regard to need. However, staab says, the eollege mnnot afford to give the
same treatment to internatronal applieane. While the college guarantees
it will meet the lull demonstrated need ofa domntic applimnr, rt oannot
afford to do so for those from outside the us. were the tollege to meet
the full demonstrated need orevery international applianl, it would be

"If Grinnell were need-
sensitive, I wouldn't have
applied here. Lots of
applicants will be discour-
aged if Grinnell'gets
need-sensitive."

College could roll back need-blind policy

spending roughly “hve to lo million dollars on oath incoming class," esti»
mated staab. The collegc currently spends about 2 million.

Although Grinnell is among the most generous liberal arts colleges in
terms othnaneral ard, it cannot alrord to be that generous. so, sometime
in the 1930s, “in order to make international studenc affordable," said
staab, the college put some caps on the amount othnaneial aid is would
award international students—a taetle that most schools employ.

under this poliey, international applicants ean reeerve up to halhtu
ition in grants. At the same time, the eollege also created ten “sptcial schol»
uships," whreh are geographienlly distributed to en.
sure diversity. These cxri'cmcly competitive sehol.
arships orrer a hall rrde to ten very qualiﬁed stu.
derrts with hrgh need.

Suyog Shrcsihri ’06, an international student
rtom Nepal, worries that a change rn the needeblind
policy may cause the number otlnrernational ap—
pllortions to drop. “listlnrsell were necd»s:llsirivc,
[wouldn't have appllcd here," he said. “Lots orape
plieanrs will be discouraged rrGrurnell goes neerle
sensitive.“ The school’s reputation for generosity.
he explained, is a large part orwhat makes-students
want to some to Grinncll.

staab disagreed. “I get a few times people ape
ply, and they say, l’m applying beeause you are neodeblrnd.” he said. “But
to be honest with you, 1 think many people don't know what mat means.
Even Ameriun students a lot or the time don't know what that means, so
international students rypieally wouldn't know either. "

Also, he said, bemrrse orthe ten special scholarships, the eollege is still
going to get “droves of applications" from hlglienced students that are
extremely qualitled.

The bottom line, said stnab, is [lmL “instead or giving so rnueh atten-
tion to a lot ortvonderful lads who wrll never be able to enroll, we’ll give
more attention to the wonderhrl kids who are more likely to be able to
enroll." .
staab deehned to comment on the likelihood that thrs proposal will
be adopted, citing the high number ortaerors rnvolved.
