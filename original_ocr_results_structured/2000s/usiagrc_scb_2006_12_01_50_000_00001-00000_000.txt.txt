The next step
for initiatives

at REBECCA PARK

Anyone who was eoiiceined about the lack of a roof over Gar
nesh has reason to tear successful student in ativrs will disappear
without a trace, Recent history is littered with examples ofstudent-
supported ideas that went nowhere. But SGA leaders and adminis-
tratois say that many of this year’s initiatives will probably be imple
mented.

Immediately after the voting, the SGA cahinet met and picked
which proposals to roliow up on. These decisions were haseri on
both importance and feasibility orthc initiatives.

Often the initiatives most likely to be enacted are simple ones
that do not require much investment. Already, a requested copy
machine has been installed in the student organizations workroom.
Another initiative calling for an elected Student Environmental
Coordinator was discussed and voted on in Joint Board recently.

The proposal for extending hours at the ﬁtness center has also, so
far, met with success. Lindsay smith '09, the initiative sponsor and a
SGA senator, explained that she has received positive feedback and
has addressed the biggest issue arising from longer hoursistudenl
employment—but still needs to meet with members of the ﬁtness
department. The initiative could be implemented as early as next
semester.

One reason that this inie
tiative could be enacted is
its practicality. “Like saying,
‘Well we should lower tu-
ition,'" Smith said. “Yes, we
should, but that's not some
thing that’s necessarily easy
to do, whereas this seems to
be something that has a lot
or support and also seems
very feasible."

Other initiatives, particularly those requiring changes from
administrators, are more difﬁcult. Substantial changes like an im
proved OutTakes service can take both time and determination to
implement.

Time is a major factor working against the implementation or
passed student initiatives. While some proposals may be popular
and feasible, there is not enough time to address them, especially
now when the administration is busy planning next year’s budget,
SGA President Chris Hall’07 said.

“It’s tough sometimes to get all of them ,passedjust for the fact
that we've got two semesters to do a lot or things and we can only
push for so much and expect to get it done,”Hall said.

Feasible initiatives that could be realized in the future, if not
now, include the proposals to open Quid rot study space, clarify
the school’s travel policies for student athletes, and hire a campus
nutritionist.

’lEXpa/rded ﬁtness center hours]
seems to be something that has
a lot of support and also seems
very feasible.”

Money is also a signirr
cant obstacle to progress on
initiatives. Vice President
for College services john
Kalkbrenner, who oversees
Dining Services (the subject
of several initiatives), said he
liked many or the proposals
but was not sure if he could
act on all ofthem. “All those
things are certainly worthy causes," Kalkbrenner said. “When you sit
in my chair, the balance is always between cost and services."

Other issues impact speciﬁc initiatives. Expanding Out Takes,
for example, would require not only more money, but also more
space. Listing ingredients would prove difﬁcult due to the fact that
most food is purchased in bulk, exempting companies rrom the laws
that regulate consumer products.

Initiatives that are not acted on this semester are not necessarily
dead. A feasible proposal could still have a future, such as opening
mad for study space. "Because or that initiative, we’re sitting off
a lot better,” Hall said. “We have solid numbers for sup ort and
student interest, and next year tlicte’s a good possibility ‘it could

irappeni.”

”When you sitin my chair, the
balance is always between cost
ondservites.”

Char! Zimi ’07 mo: an eric armpit/er in 1/2: Forum} new Creative Computer Lab.

What if they built a new
lab and no one came?

The new Creative Computing Lab in the Forum has state-of-the—art tech-
nology, but limited hours and minimal advertising have led to low usage

The fuzzy early afternoon sunlight
shone through the glass walls to where
Jessica Rhoades’07 was sitting. In front
ora huge screen, she laid back in a cozy
chair, listening to the computer reading
aloud the paper she just edited. “1 am
a very audio learner, and 1 can hear er
tors in my paper," Rhoades said. “That's
why I like these computers."

Rlioadcs was one
or the only three
computer users in '
the lounge at the
time. Here in the
Forum is the Cre-
ative Computing
Lab (CCL), which
opened in Octohcr
but is still a mystery to many students.
The lab provides cuttingvedge hardware
and software that many students do not
have access to elsewhere. Limited hours
and a lack oradvertising, however, have
limited student usage orthe CCL so rat
this semester.

The new lab helps to ﬁll the area in
the Forum that was previously helovcd
public space. It contains a coffee mat
chine, a wireless bar, comfortable chairs
and a bank orcompurers, mostly high—
end Macintoshcs.

While most lab computers on carn-

pus are PCs, the CCL Macs have POW*
crrul photo- and video-editing softt
ware, including Adobe Photoshap and
illustrator. “Atgmbly [Macs] are just
made to do [multimedia editing] bet-
ter,” said Eryn O’Neil '07, the Technole
ogy Consultant Helpdesk coordinator.
“The [multimedia] software is better
on Mac a lot of the times."

However, the lack of Windows
systems is a con,
cern. “[The PCs]
have huge monitors,
and they are really
quick, but there are
only two of them,"
O’Neil said. Us»
ers more familiar
with Windows can
bring in theirown computers ornsktl‘ie
Helpdesk to open their lS-PC training
room adjacent to the main lounge.

Soleil Ho '09 the
SGA liason for the
Student Academic

mittee, said many
people seem uncom-
fortable with the new
lab, "The changes are
so drastic compared to the old Forum,"
she said. “It kind of freaks people out."

Some students have complained
about the shorter opening hours of
