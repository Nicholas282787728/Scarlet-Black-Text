Three eligible bachelors
in this weekend’s films

Take your pick between scary Harry, sexy Adam, and Pee-Wee
at the movies, or go to Waltz on Saturday night

November 30 2001

laym Well, this is going to be a frightening weekend.
First up. we've got a creepy French thriller and then a eieepy
Paul Reubens chasing a bicycle. What is the world coming
to?

Brad: Oh Jayn, don't worry, Harris will be emptier than
Cowles on sunday morning, mainly bemuse rherc won't
be a new movie on Saturday night due to Walo. Also, sube
titles never seem to draw out a crowd.

Before we begin, though, I’d like to reinforce the mile
darity ofcrities around the country by bashing Hany par.
ieri Actually, the movie's quite good—it trims the plot very
well. but lacks the eharaercr development, description, or
magic ofrhe book. Now for another chap named Harry:
