 

Open Letter, Regarding The Coca-Cola Company’s
Commitment to Labor Rights

As someone who has devoted my career to labor issues, I share the concerns of student activists
regarding labor conditions around the world. Through my work with the United Nations
International Labor Organization, I have seen ﬁrsthand the manifold difference it makes in the
lives of individuals, families, communities and entire countries when employers live up to their
responsibilities to workers. ‘

Committed to Fair Labor Practices.

My employer, The Coca—Cola Company, is committed to fair labor practices everywhere we
do business. Around the world, Coca~Cola workers are free to exercise their rights to union
membership and collective bargaining without pressure or interference. In fact, we are one
of the most highly unionized multinational companies in the world, and we keep working to
improVe our labor relations practices

Given the state of the world today, many of the countries where we operate are burdened with
ongoing conﬂicts. Concerns have centered on Colombia, where violence against trade unionists
and many others has been going on for decades and has deterred most people from joining
unions. Even so, more than 30 percent of Coca—Cola workers in Colombia belong to unions,
compared to a national average of 4 percent.

Working to Keep Employees Safe.

We share the concerns that many have expressed about the violence in Colombia and we are
Working to keep our employees safe. Coca—Cola bottlers work with unions and the government
to provide emergency cell phones, transportation to and from work, secure housing, and a host
of other measures to protect employees. Additional security measures are routinely provided to
union leaders and special measures are undertaken when a threat against unionized employees
is brought to the attention of the bottler’s management.

 

Committed to Colombia.

We are proud of our 70—year history in Colombia and our contributions to local communities,

and we are committed to supporting the country’s progress. We invite universities, non— '
government organizations, as well as our critics, to join in a constructive engagement process

to improve the conditions for labor in Colombia.
