Marcus Eagam: How do you deﬁne human rights?

Jack Donndly: I use the literal dcﬁnitionﬂ list of rights that

people have, simply because they’re human. Being someone that

has worked in international rclations,l think the easiest thing for
us to do in terms of specifye
ing that list is just simply look
through the body of Human
Rights Law.

Eagnn: In your published dis-
sertation, T/Ie Ctmu‘pz‘ o/Htmmn
Rig/its, you state,

“Rights can be claimed.” Could
you elaborate on that assertion?

Donnelly: There’s this whole
idea otelaiming rights, ofassemng them, of demanding them. It’s
actually central to human rights. being right makes you an active
participant in shaping the world, rather than just being the beneﬁt
ciary ofsomcbody else's obligations. That’s why we vlmnt rights. I
think the whole idea behind claiming and entitlement is this spe
cial kind of empowerment. When you have a tight to something,
you’re empowered in a particular way It's not just that it's good,
yours entitled to claim it and that alters the relationship.

Eagant What about the notion of two separate groups having
conﬂicting claims?

Donnelly: That happens all the time. I think that's one thing we
have to realize. [Humans] hold lots of rights that conﬂict oxcr
n‘me.Thc idea that morality or politics is a neatly ordered series of
righrﬁthatjust isn't realThe real world is a world in which there
are deeply conﬂicting claims of human rights. one or the things
that is invole in the claim of human rights is that they tcnd to
have some kind of [prioritization] of some claims over other kinds
of claims. So, this idea of conflicting rights, tights conflicting with
each other and conﬂicting with values is absolutely ccntml to the
whole idea behind human rights. At the moml point there certain
kinds of claims that take the highest priority. Some people talk
about human rights as “Pammount Moral Rights."Tllar, sort of,
gets at the idea that there is ranking but also conﬂict.

Hagan: I have a particular context for you [on tanking rights],
Moshe Yaalon, the fan-net chief of army and current minister in
Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet, is quoted in Israel Today and vari-
ous other publications saying, “Jews have an unassailable right to
settle wherever they please, particularly, the land of the Bible.”l
just want to ask about when a man makes a claim for a up of
people he identiﬁes with as having an “unassailablc right" to settle
wherever [they desire]

Donnelly: Two kinds of questions there: One, where does the
right come from? Two, how, then, does it rank with other rights?
The “unassailable” says that it is never overridden by any other
right, the implicit claim is that, somehow, Jews have it and Jews
must have gotten it through a covenant with God. Now that is an
interesting set otclaims that 1 think the majority ottsraelis dorit
believe in, let alone, people who don’t have this kind ofhisroryBut,
I think there’s the point.

We're going to have to ask where the rights come trorn and
how they relate to others. i think the answer is, that’s a large part

ofwhat political conﬂict is about. So, Palesrinians will assert the
“inalienable righo of the Palestinian people."Thntls the laagiage
that has been used in the UN context for a couple decades now,
and is one set ofclaims.

Palestinians also assert a different kind of historic right, con-
nected with having lived on the land for a certain period oflimc,
right? [They have] their international legal rightsl think the point
is that any sort of claim that one right, or one set oftights, from a
single source always takes priority, is almost certainly wrong.

What we really have is a world, as you put it before, of compet
lug claims. A large part of political conversation is about how do
we resolve these competing claims—even accepting them as valid.

Hagan: [In regard to] social contracts, which you mention earlier,
do you think that our human rights are substantiated in the Bill
of Rights? If not, do you think that social contracts can ever come
plerely deﬁne our human rights?

Donnelly: Not completely, Let's think about the U.S. Bill of
Rights, which is usually as close as most Americans get to talking
about human rights" iwe only talk about human rights overseas.
we talk about Hconslil’ulional rights in the US. Noticc that these
rights dont appeal, explicitly to any standard beyond the U S co“,
stitution. So, there is a contractual basis time, right? There's not
cxplicit appeal outside otwhatever kind of implicit social contract
lics inside the constitution. I think one otthe interesting questions
is whether thcrc is somc ofkind ofnioral or, kind of, human rights
basis tor these rights. If thcre are, how these two sepamte rights
relate.

Think about for example, Guantanamo. Whether or not con-
stitutional rights apply to the prisoners of Guantanamo, thctc are
interesting questions about whether international legal rights apt
ply to them or human rights, understood in more moral ten-ns, apt
ply to them.The idea that a social connact can completely deﬁne
rights, even for people who are partied‘ to that contact, is pmbr
lematie. it can be what's central, what's politically and legally most
central. Usually, that contract appeals to some deeper, moml, or
religious theory

Then, certainly, those who arcnt partied“ to that contract must

have rights in some other way Again, what wevc go is, hope-

fully not deeply competing rights, but different strands of rights,
that interact in complex kinds otways. So, notice that conservative
Americanjurists are reluctant to make appeals outside of the con,
stitution.Trying to treat die constitution as if it is a complete states
mom of the legal system.This is, sort of, a Scalia kind ofline, right?

other sounds or inrerpr ation emphasize the importance
of going back to underlying principles,which have a religious or
moral or International basis of some fashion. It’s really a matter of
going back to the Israeli example, where do rights come from, and
the idea that [humans] have multiple sources ofrights.1 think one
of the interesting things about the US. case is the typical American
assumption that the constitution and international human rights
law are essentially the same. International law is broader than that.

Hagan: But,wllo—

Donndly: You’re looking for an answer about who decides? 1t de-
pends on who, what, where and how.

Eagam Who is the intemationalf

Donnelly: There is no authoritative decision. There is authorir
tative decision. There is no body that has the legal right to have
binding legal judgment on human rights.

Eagant That’s you!

Donnelly: No, that isn’t me. It’s hard to think of a domestic legal
analogy, but what we have is a process, by which can agree on rules.
But not process, by which, those mles are authoritatively interpret»
ed and authoritatively interpreted. And, that’s the state of Human
Rights Law. That is the state of most international law.

Eagan: I’m sure you have traveled across the country to various
universities, what is your impression ofGrinncll?

Donnell : Iwas here this summer actually, seems like a nice place.
1 certainly like the history. ‘Founded by abolitionists' can never be
bad. .
