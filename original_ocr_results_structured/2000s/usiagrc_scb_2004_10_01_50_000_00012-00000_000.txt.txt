Defending pro- In our defense
life is fascist

In the editorial included in the Sept. 24
edition ofthc SEE, the editors make the case
that in order to have meaningful dialogue
ALL opinions and views must be equally
respected, as “there is an inherent value in
allowing students of any ideology to freely
associate and express their beliefs,” and that
“students [in disagreement] should see it as
an opportunity to engage in dialogue that
will broaden both sides view points."

Let me be the first to say not only do I
not give any credence to this myopic adher-
ence to some lofty egali-
tarian fantasy of rational
debate, but I would fully
support SILENCING
this idealistic and harmful
notion by any means.

What sort of notion of
constructive debate do you
have? I was at that David
Horowitz speech last year,
and I was embarrassed not
by the behavior of students, but by the fact
that students at my collegerrsupposedly a
place with a rigorous academic discipline"
would pnd that charlatan’s salary.

One of the ﬁrst things I learned in ANY
class here at Grinnell is that you have to
have some standards to be considered aca-
demically relevant, which includes, namely,
a coherent point backed by meaningful evi-
dence, refutations of arguments to the con-
trary, and a selfecririquing method by which
one proves their argument valid and pertir
nent.

That pitiful excuse for a scholar failed
on all accounts. Why any idiot with a talent
for ﬁring up an equally academically irrel-
evant partisanship should be allowed on the
grounds of a supposed institution of learn—
ing, let alone given a microphone, let alone
paid is beyond me.

But of course, fire back the judges of
fairness and equality at the SE53, everyone
is given their own fair voice in a democracy,
regardless ofhow nsinine they or their opin—
ions may be. BULLSHIT.

For one rhing, there has never been
frccdom of speech and expression in this
country for people who are ACTUALLY
ﬁghting for their rights
(think: right to safety,
well being, control of his/
her body, and food. NOT
the right to expose fascist
dogma) as I tried to point
out to Horowitz when he
was here; why are conserva-
tives so marginalized when
over 1,000 minorities die in
police custody a year and 3
our of4 women are raped? THESE are the
people who deserve to bc championed.

I won’t even ger started on the sham of
a ‘representation’ system we claim to have.
Equal voice? Perhaps in a Norman Rocks
well painting, not in this country.

The opinion that the SGB is presenting
is reactionism, to its core. When a fascist
position such as ‘pro—life’ is protected from
people DEFENDING THEMSELVES by
those claiming to be working in the name
of freedom. that is a reactionary measure to
quell a natural response to a threatening
posture.

to control their womb, they should be sup-
portcd. Proelrt’c’ is not a legitimate point of
vicw, it is fascism.

Fascism is a movomcnt of group hysteria
by which singular idealist notions ofself and
society are propagated at the harm ofany ins
dividual or group standing in its way (not to
go into the relating material and economic
factors, read Theodor Adorno or Hannah
Ateiidt for a much more detailed analysis).

If you are tiying to force youi notion of
life, identity, or morals ns port of a move-
ment onto others, you aie
fascist.

Some may call this argu-
ment extreme. However, it
is just that sort of fear of
calling what looks, acts, and
feels like fascism what it is
that allows fascism to re
main a force not only in the
world bur most assuredly in
this very country.

I, speaking only for myself, have no prob-
lem ifsomeone wants to believe that a fetus
is a human being. However, the very INr
STANT you try and enforce your beliefonto
someone else (e.g. institute laws regarding
someone else's bodily organs) you put your
selfat risk for any sort ofmethod of self~der
fense that someone at risk may invoke.

This could go as far as heckling, grafﬁti,
or even in extreme circumstances, physical
violence.

The same goes for any point of view. If
someone was to come to campus and espouse
not an academic opinion, but a threat to my
way oflife, 1 would respond accordingly.

This pro-life group is definitely not a
real threat to me or my loved ones, and that
is why I decided to ignore them and let rhem
have their fun creating moralistic slogans to
try subjugate other’s bodies and minds to
their idealistic notions of‘life’ (as if they had
any grounding in actual evidential accounts
of real life biology, philosophy, or experie
cnce) although I respect the light of otheis
to defend themselves as they see fit.

However, if any campus organization is
going to try and argue that promoting fas-
cism is a legitimate form ofpersoiial expres-
sion, I will fight THAT by
any means necessary.

1 voice my solidarr
ity with any person who
fights to defend her/himr
self against those parties
(those actually proposing
fascism and those allowing
its proposal), and 1 hope
that the rest of campus
would nor stand idly by as
fascist mentalities and the CORRELARY
reactionist liberalists that allow that cancer
to take root do as they please.

I would hope that the staff of the 5:".th
would reconsider their defense of idealism
at the expense of women’s rights to defend
themselves.

lfyou need any further examples ofhow
this process occurs, I suggest you investit
gate the history of the rise of fascist regimes
abroad and at home, as evidence, not ides
alism, is the better indicator of normative
choice.

We are writing in response to the ethe
toiiitl and cover story in last week’s 8&13
regnrdmg the first meeting of rhe ProrLife
Club. As pic-choice students we decided
to attend the meeting to
objectively gnin first-hand
information regal-ding
the new club’s mission on
campus. Disruption and
offense were never our
intent and we absolutely
agree with and respect the
founders’ rights to form
this group. We also agree
that the vandalism to their
signs was completely inappioptiate and
substandard.

What began as a discussion of the
group's mission statement developed into
a somewhat contentious interaction as We
sought to clarify their plans for campus,
We did not engage in “heckling” of any
kind and, as Grinnellians, would ourselves

S&B, campus need
to reform views

Dear SGB,

1. I think we would all like the old logo
and letterhead back. We gave it a chance,
but it just isn’t doing it for us.

2. Can we please see relevant opinions in
the opinions section as we were promised?
The Editorial was relevant
and Well’fl‘ﬂmed, but does
not go beyond the scope of
what is going on at Grln’

I thought we were
supposed to be

party. We are now nothing more than a
conglomeration of many disparate interests
(organized labor, the srnollefarmer lobby,
the AfricantAmerican and Latino groups,
the elderly, the gay rights movement, Cnvl’
ronmentalists,‘ etc.). These are certainly all
valid issue-focuses, but we
need to express an over-
arching theme that in-
cludes everyone in a great-

nell college. I thought we
wcrc supposed to be getting
pieces of a broader nature,

getting pieces of
a broader nature,
addressing current

er scope, and not issue by
issue, ifwe are going to re
gain control. We, not they,

addressing current nation-
a1 and global issues. The
closest thing was Benjie’s
comedic opinion piece,

3. Benjie’s piece, while welleinrended, is
factually inaccurate. Conservatives, despite
all their faults, are actually far more consis
tent than libelals, This is why they are far
more successful in the present day Benjie’s
attempt to unveil an inconsistency is an act
of “inherent silliness," as he puts it. The
Neocons and the Christian Fundamentalists

issues.

. are. two entirely different groups of conser—

vatives with entirely different agendas, and
neither is the same as the gun lobby! There
is no major inconsistency within each of
these groups.

As for the Democrats, we have unformr
nately very little cohesion. Speaking from
experience in Democratic Party politics, and
as a Delegate to the Democratic National
Convention, I can tell you this is a serious
issue. It is because ofinconsistency that libs
erals have lost power regularly for the last
10 years. we have, as a party, flip-flopped
on many issues while the Republicans were
steadfast. This is what his scared so many
away from the Democratic Party.

On a larger note, there is too much in-
fighting, too much singletissue, special-
interest focus. We used to be the people’s

national and global

are inconsistent.

Case and point is
Grinnell’s current contror
versy with the pro-lifets.
Liberals proclaim they support free-expres-
sion and free-association, bur they only re-
ally do so when they agree with a group's
agenda, We lack sympathy for those who
we are supposed to protect. (Here at Grin-
nell, the proelifers need standing up for.) I
personally know both Cathy and Mary, and
have found them to be two of the sweetest
people at Grinnell. They think for them
selves, express their views, and defend them
(self-governance, helloill. 1 may not agree
with what they have to say, but I will tie
fend to the death their right to say it. Same
thing with David Horowitz last year. our
reaction was NOT an expression of self—
governance. it Was an embarrassment. It
was far worse than a group otconscrvnrives
would have treated a liberal speaker.

Let’s be more tolerant, more \VCll-in-\
formed, and more willing to hear oppose
ing viewpoints. Essentially, let's get off out
high horses and grow up. Ifwe want to take
power back, we have got to earn it. Gtinnell
would be a start.
