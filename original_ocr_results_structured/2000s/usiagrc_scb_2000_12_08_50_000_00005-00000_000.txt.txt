Joe does not exist

Dear Readers,

we have a confession ro make. we are nor really indcpcn»
deur editors ofGrim Ice reinberg. we are rhe voice efan as»
sembly oisrudenrs (mainly philosophy majors) who are work.
ing ro promore mediocrity on campus rhrough a rejection of
everyrhing rhar is nor us (because we like art, bur haven'r the
courage ro admit thatwe’re awful arrisrs). The rrurh is rhar Joc
deesn'e even exist: at leasr nor as rhe capiralisr world once knew
him. we have taken over his body and soul, having rhoroughly
cleansed him of all ambirion and resson, and trained him ro
make correcr decisions. This was achieved by sysremarically
weaning poor Joe from popular culrure such as Chrisrina
Aguilera and rhe like (after we rore him from the window ofan
lowa Ciry Abcrcrombic or rirch). As a resulr, he was nor able
re engage in any of the parries ar Harris center, which made
him feel invisible on campus; in a sense. he did not exist. He
came re us on a sarurday nighr, begging for his confiscared
Backsrrcee Boys baseball cap, and demanding to know why he

eouldnr danoe rhe Masarena wirh rhe orher kids Being good
friends we promptly dropped ourinsrrumencs (we were rrying
desperarely re derune our guirars and ro play as disjoinredly as
humanly possible |n prepararion fer a Gardner concert) sar iec
down, dried his rears wirh some Threw/l Pisatt/n WTO leak
less, and read ro him. What did we read so him my breehers
and sisters? First, rhe opening passages of Sarrre's Being and
Noni-signer, ro convince his poor seul rhar he really did nor
exisr. Second, we read to him from Marx, to convince him rhar
capirslism was rho roor ofhis woes. Ofeourse, we were able co
crush any dissenr sremrning from logical or rcalisric thinking
by manipularing rhe vocabulary and grammar ofour argumems
so rhar any cxixrenrially weakened being could nor help bur
agree wirh us. Once we had taken eonrrol ofhis soul, we named
him using Pavlov's condrriencd response merhod ro regurgrrare
radical ideology on command. This was done by placing our
recruir in a cage and administering high volragcs efeleerrieiry
every rirne he reached tor a big Mac. Before you lump to con»
clusions, you musr realize, my dear readers, rhar we are not
cruel. We are doing rhis for Joe and you, nor for ourselves. Joe
was nor punished ineessanrly in the cage, only when he erred.
Every rime he ignored rhe juicy all-bcefpatty in favor ofNoam
Chomsky or Plato, we rewarded him wirh an apperizing Vegan
Souree meal and a her beverage brewed from organically grown
cofree beans While rherc were some side effecrs (namely an
inronse jitter due ro caffeine addicrion; embarrassingly obvious
arousal ar the mcnrion of words like "capital," “society." and
"politics"; and an inability ro write coherently—which we have
continually apologized for) we neverrhelcss had Joe on our side,
And that's whar counts. Because ears arr ugly, And rhere ir a
definite hierarchy in rhe worldeiusr nor rhe way capitalism
would define ir. And philosephers should rule us iusr like Plero
said (we'd never soil ourselves by actually working). And we
should nor be subject ro constrainrs like pragmarism, competin
rien, er inrelligenr arguments because that is for the lesser masses

Coincidence? I think not Super-power!

A terrible mistake

Madame Editor.

1 fear rhar a rerrible misrake has been made. It appears
rhar someone has confused rhe lsrh cenrury Spanish Monk

lished as Mr. reinberg's work originared, in faer, from rhe lirrle
known Alscaeian Philosopher Suckaelius. please make sure rhis
misrake is rectified.

i have never been asked to answer the “Across
the Tracks" section. I attend lunch and dinner fie.
guently and at random times. The probability of
running into an 5&3 staff member during the poll-
ing process is in my favors However, this never hap-
pened. This leads me to conclude that the entire
survey is bogus. it is some scheme initiated from
someone on top, probably Rusty l<. himself, to make
it seem as if there is no difference between North
and South campus. whether North campus is com~
posed of clueless jocks and South campus resides
the pot-smoking hippies is irrelevant, What does
matter is that we be allowed to formulate our own
opinion and beliefs, without this Osgoodisitc pru-

We're all familiar with ink-blot tests and personality
surveys, but how much do they really say about us? 1
think a far more telling indicator of ane's personality is
to askthem; If you had a super—hero power, what would
it be? laser eyesi inﬁnite Strength? People skills? My
own super-power would have to be mental»time-travel,
the ability for your mind to travel back in time within
your own body. Unhappy with that test you just took?
Memorize the answer sheet and ZaaAAP! Suddenly you
become yourself on the previous day, armed with the
knowledge to succeed, This of course reveals the inse—
curities I have about consequences and ramiﬁcations,
my need to know what will happen before taidng any
actions Now is the time for a revolution of personal
discovery and self-empowerment; let’s all pick out our

super—hero powers! So what can you do?

AS ! waited in a hugely long line to get into uuad
the other day, i couldn't help but wonder what was
so specialabout specialdinner. The food seems to be
different, but only in the sense that they put really
weird combinations of ingredients together in one
dish, covered it in fennel, and called it something
foreign. other than the small happiness 1 get from
seeing the confused looks on the vegans‘ fates and
the slightly greater joy I get from seeing the first
years burning themselves on the candles, I don’t re.
ally enjoy the meal at all. The worst part or it all is
that since it is called special dinner, 1 am indeed eXr
peeling something special, and not in the ”cousin
Jed’s special” sense. In not sure if all of the lines,
crowds, and contusion are worth a twice-baked per
tato and a tablecloth. _Smh Am“
