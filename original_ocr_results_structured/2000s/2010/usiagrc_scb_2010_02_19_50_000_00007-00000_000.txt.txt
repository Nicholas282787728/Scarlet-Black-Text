o, 25 InIlcs later you’ll come upon Ladora. It would be easy
to pass through this town of 287 people without much ofa
pause—right past the tightly clustered rows of houses. the
boarded up main street, the non»desclipt city hall and fire
station, and the Ladora Stora gas station— ifit weren’t for

. the majestic old Ladora Savings Bank Bistro IIght In the
mid'dle ofit

Its classical stone architecture and the triumphant

. engravIng above the entrance— the wealth of tho
community embodies the rIchness ofher soil, the Integrity,
frugalIty and diligence of her people; are a remInder of
an earlier time In- Ladora, the year 1920, when high gram
and land prices drove a prosperity and stIaIghtfonaId
optImIsrn that has long since disappeared, along wIth
Ladora’s main street businesses. Even by the time the bank
opened In the summer of 1920, the post-world War 1
afﬂuence that drove its construction was drying up.

The Ladora Bank was only able to survive as a bank
for 11 years, closing down In 1931 during the onset of the
Great Depression. Since then It has played many rolesia
communIty center, an Insurance ofﬁce, a civil defense
shelter, a voting station, a place for truckers to sleep
(before the completion ofl— 80' In 1964 drew commercial
trathc and busIness away from Highway 6 and Ladota), an
attorneys ofﬁce an antique shop and a drapery busIness.
The bank’s latest one, a wine bar and bistro, may be the
strangest and most ﬁtting one of all.

Brad Erikson, a Grinnell resident, first saw the
bank on a motorcycle'ride through the country in 2003.
“Look at this jewel in the middle of nowhere," Erickson
recalled, recalling sporting the bank for the first time.
it Is an Impression probably shared by many travelers
on Highway 6 over the years. Brad Erickson, unlike -
other passers- through, decIded to buy the bank In 2004,
intending to make it a home. As he worked to restore the
marbled, hIgh-ceIled Interior ofthc bank, he found vIsItors
wandering In and peeking through the windows, thinking
it was museum. He eventually had to lock himselfin when
he was working and rethink how he was going to use this
85 year old edifice.

After four years ofrestoration work, he and his wae
colleen Klainert opened the Ladora Bank Bistro In May
2008. At a glance 'Its easy to think that an upscale wIne bar
and bistro, with wines ranging in price from around 320 to
two a bottle and appetIzers running between :8 and :10,
would be a gentriﬁed establIshment in a place like Ladora.
Although Erickson notes that they rely on a fatsranging
customer base from urban areas like Iowa City, Cedar
Rapids and Des Moines, with people coming from as far
as ﬁve hours away to vIsIt, locals and outeofe'towners alike
have embraced the Bistro.

There is even a group oflocal farmers who formed a
club based on Dom Perignon, the Bistros most expensive
grape delicacy. Brad also noted that the Bistro has become
a halfway meeting point for Grinnell College faculty and

Grinnell. including students, will make the drive out to
Ladora.

While the BIstro serves only drinks and appetizers,
rather than entrees, Brad and Colleen encourage customers
to stay for while, to savor their food and drinks and
to share. The appetizers incorporate a number of local
ingredients, including Maytag Bleu cheese, Dayton Locker
meats and Amana Colony preserves.

We tried the artichoke s read and mini mushroom

Chicago recruiter was essential to student life

BYJUMI BELLO

For most ChIcago- -brcd Grinnellians, their yourney to
Grinnell usually begins the same way—Marlene Jacks. it
starts with a high school college fair but after a few phone
calls from Jacks, most current Chicagoan students would
ﬁnd themselves on a bus on their way to GrInnell college.
Though Jacks oversaw the admissions process for many
students, keeping in contact-with them throughout their
Grinnell careers, Gtinnell students now feel her absence
on campus acutely. Through a string ofrurnors that led to
an emergency CBS meeting with the administration, the
news was released that Jacks was recently let go from the
admissions staff.

Jerl Fields 11, Jeremy Johnson 11 and Victor Golden
'13 were all recruited by Jacks in their

The news of Jacks' removal began as

a rumor, according to Monfort. She then

went to a number of different college

to be guIded and have somebody to hold our hands but

'somebody to understand that sometimes Grinnell really is

an uncomfortable place."

With Jacks' absence this semester. students are

beginning to realize the repercussions of no longer having

her at Grinnell. Where do all the students of color go to?
Thats a big deal. I have no one to go to now, Golden said
"lfl needed help,who do I go to? I don t know anyone from

who do 1 go to now?"
