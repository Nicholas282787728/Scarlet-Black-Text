Or: how I learned to stop worrying and

Well, this is my last article and I thought I would end with
something I'm sure many people have wondered about. whyI
don't wear a shirt. In response to the question of why I don't
wear a shirt, I respond with a question: “Why would I wear
a shirt?” or coursc what most people would respond is, “Cuz
that's just what you do" or, “Cuz it's indecent not to wear a
shirt.” sure, that's rhe European cultural heritage of America
speaking. but it doesn‘t answer my question from a functional
perspective, People who move to new environments often retain
maladaptive traditions for a while such as the Norse setuers in
Greenland retaining Scandinavian style clothing although his
uit clothing was far more efficient for that environment. I Will
therefore examine what i think are the reasons why Europeans
(U.s. included) developed their clothing habits.

The first and most obvious reason for wearing clothing is
that it keeps you warm. I agree with this usage of clothing—it
is very efficient to insulate yourself to retarn heat. In winter I
do wear clothes but I find that when its warm this reason does
not apply.

I believe that the reason why there is a taboo of covering
the chest in Europe even when vmm is ultimately the result of
intensive agriculture Bear with me. In Europe in summer it's
warm enough that you don’t need to wear a shirt in order to stay
warm. In fact, it serves to make you hot and sweaty, Why then
would people cover their chests? I believe that it is because of
risk ofskin cancer. Based simply on environmental factors (lati-
tude, cloud cover, etc), people in Paris should have around the
same skin color as Ioways and Meskwakis (indigenous people
from around here). However Ioway and Meskwaki skin tones
line up more with people from Tunisia. The question is then,
why are Europeans so abnormally white? The answer lies in the
people who live at a higher latitude than the white Europeans
and yet are still a little bit darker: the Sami.Thc Sami are highly
dependenton fish and wild game.The theory is thatwhen peo-
ple switch from diets heavy in wild meats (which are heavy in
vitamin D) to grain heavy, vitamin D deﬁcient diets they have
to get more of their vitamin D from the sunﬂnticulnly in
winter. When UV rays hit the skin the skin creates vitamin D.

OPINION

The more melanin (l.e,, the darker your skin is) you have, the
loss UV rays you let rn.Thorefore, since agriculturalisrs were no
longer getting as much vitamin D from meat, they had to get
more from the sun in winter, Therefore, they evolved lighter
skin. In summer, this came back to bite them, since they were
now lighter than they should have been from a sun protection
standpoin(.Therefore they developed a taboo against exposing
the torso (since that takes the brunt of the sun). Unfortunately,
this taboo was then spread to many parts of the world where
the people were dark enough that they did not need it.

At any rate, now that I've estabhshcd the why I believe our
society wear clothes, on to suggestions and predictions about
clothes. I think that

ncr once and it quickly stopped feeling unusual. In fact, I would
argue that clothing often serves to accentuate breasts and in-
crease their scxualiry. The basic act of covering something int
herently increases its appeal by making it the unknown.I pres
dict that the move to toplessiiess will eventually happen anyway
and is already in the process ofhappening.T-shirts were con
sidcrcd underwear 100 years ago and would have been consid-
ered scandalous to wear in public.Tank tops or camisoles would
have been scandalous cvcn 50 years ago. I predict that upper
garments will continue to diminish (i,c., tank top, to sports bra.
to mesh bra, to nothing) over time. Try it. I guarantee you that
it'll feel better on an 80 degree day to not be wearing a shirt.

indigenous peoples) are slowly replacing Whites in the us (by
2050 Latinos are projected to be 30% of the US population),
meaning that burning will become progressively less ofa prob-

outside and would mean that we could waste less energy on
air conditioning. Toplessncss is legal in many states, including
10%. Also, seeing breasts quickly stops being a sexual thing if
it is not treated as something unusual. My house did naked dint

Using technology and openness to bridge the distance gap

Dear SHIC,

My boyfriend and 1 want to stay together over the summer,
but he'll be in Wyoming and I live in Iowa. Honestly, I’m wor-
ried about how well our relationship will hold up without the
sex. What’ll I do without his disco stick? More importantly,
what'll he do without mine? I’ve been thinking about cyber sex
but I'm embarrassed to ask.

Please advise,

Shuckin' the Corn

Dear STC,

Don't worry. People have been maintaining lost distance
relationships for a long
time, and they’ve been
getting busy at a dis-
tance for just as long.

If you’ve got a strong

stomach, check out the

love letters james joyce

sent to Nora Barnacle.

In any event, you have

plenty of options (in

cludmg the Us postal

service). The first thing

you need to do, though,

is talk to your boyfriend about it. it's always important to get
consent for any sexual activity, and to be any fun, this kind in
particular requires mutual enthustusm.

In fact, phondcmail/Skypc/insranr messenger/telegraph
sex can be a great way to really find out what turns your boy
on and develop your sexual relationship. You might find that
the sex is better than ever next semester! Do yourself a favor,

Ifyou don’t want your picture to show up on 4chan.com, make

agreeing to treat each others' messages as borrowed you can
ask for yours to be deleted at any time. Really, though; this can
only work ifyou trust each athcr.

If you’re both completely comfortable with it, you might
also consider agreeing to sleep with other people for the sum-
mer. Again. set the rules before you have a chance to break them:

Photos III “IE WEEK

Love Your Body week. Getting to know your own body can
only make sex better.

Maintaining a long distance relationship isn’t just about
sex, though. You need to make sure you're comfortable work
ing through conﬂicts with your boyfriend wirla words, because
that’s the only medium you’ll have, and fights have a way of
getting magnified by distance and frustration. Reassure hirrt
frequenrly about your feelings for him. Find a way to visit if
you both can and want to. Send love letters. Do whatever the
spirit moves you to do.

One last thing: if you don’t think you can do it. don’t. It’s
probably better to be honest with yourself and break up now
than to wait until you have a bigger reason to. This is going to
take commitment no matter what you decide the rules are. A
thriving long distance relationship can have all ofthe intimacy
ofbeing in person, minus the touching, but you're going to have
to try for it.

Love, SHIC
