Talking About The Weather: It’s an anachronistic,
overplayed and Draconian policy of the 5&3’5 to
avoid writing on the weather, but hey—it’s nice out!

Saturday night sexism

Dear Men’s Soccer Team,

A campaign to end all campaigns It’s not lazy, just business savvy!

Dear people running for sea ofﬁce: Kudos to Scott Cofﬁn for pulling out the mic

Students speak
about what’s on
their minds in 142
words or fewer,
and you‘re invited!
[f you have a rant,
e-mail it to
[sargenta]. Com-
plaining in a public
forum is always
more fun than do»
ing it alone.

While I am endlessly excited for the epic
night that is Disco and appreciate the creativ-
ity that went into the T—shirt designs, I ﬁnd the
message "Saturday Night Beaver” olIensiye. The
obvious euphemism for a certain prur of rhe fer
male anatomy coupled with the portrayal of [he
beaver on the shirt as female sends a message
of male sexual prowess. I feel that this message
is hardly gender neutral—a value that is, and
should be, important to the Grinnell community.
Disco should be about everyone having a good
time rather than ﬁnding a “beaver” to take home.
I hope that next year you can ﬁnd a design that
includes nll members of the communiry.

it accomplishes is convincing more and more
