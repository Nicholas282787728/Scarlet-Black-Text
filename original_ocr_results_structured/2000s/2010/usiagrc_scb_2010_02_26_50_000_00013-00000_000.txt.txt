To Rudder or Not to Rubber?

Dear Rubber Hamlet (Rubber OpheliaP),

This is a sticky issue indeed! And our expert opinion is
definitely ‘To Rubber.'Your boyfriend is technically correct—
pre-cum itselfdoes not contain sperm. However, leftover sperm
from a previous ejaculation up to 24 hours beforehand can be
come mixed with pre-curn. While urinating will likely clear the
urethra, sperm can he very tricky and stubborn, and it is core
tainly best not to risk it.

It is also important to know that sometimes people have
less control over when they ejaculate than they might think.
Even ifyour boyfriend successfully withdraws before he ejacur
lates, he might not know if he has already pre-ejaculated. Also,
prercum can transmit HIV as well as other STIs. In all hon-
esty. pregnancy scares or STI mishaps could ultimately be more
damaging to your relationship than a tiny layer of latex, one
in seven HIV diagnoses are for people who believed that they
were in a monogamous relationship prior to the diagnosis.

While we don’t want anyone to be pessimistic, we definitely
want everyone to be pragmatic and proactive milking sure that
they stay sexually healthyl You can try ultrarth'm condoms as
well, with five different varieties available at the Sexual Health

Information Center. All in all, it’s deﬁnitely a smart idea to
keep using some type of contraception and protection, as it’s
always best to choose the safer option.

Love, the SHIC

that every birth control pill is different and you should read
your individual pill's instructions before altering your pill
schedule no matter what.

With that said, for most oral contraceptives, if you realize
that you’ve forgotten to take your pill within 24 hours since
your last pill, you can take it as soon as you remember and
resume your regular pill schedule. Many people think that if
you miss a pill one day, you should take two at the usual time
the nert. However, you're actually supposed to rake the forgots

Dear Frantic and Forgetfulr

First off, we'd like to congratulate you on your hot hook up,
although we hope you had the decency to shave off his tacky
bleached or dreaded hair first. Why the eye candy of winter
athletics goes to such unfortunate pains to sabotage their own
good looks for the sake oftheir sport is heyond us.

But back to the problem at hand,..It’s important to note

. ception until your next
cycle.

It sounds like you're doing this anyway, which is great.
Especially if you have multiple partners or are not in a mo—
nogamous relationship, you should be using some other form
of prophylactic in order to prevent the transmission of STIs. If
you have any more pill related questions, deﬁnitely come to the
Sexual Health Information Center and ask a peer educator, as
we have lots more information.

Love, the SHIC

A new vision for neighborhoods: more nature, more community

In my last column, I brieﬂy described a system ofrotat‘ing
cooking duties so that people can continue cooking (which
is part of our human heritage) while still being efficient
This sort of thinking could be extended to other areas like
dog walkmg~dogs should be walkcd about two hours a day,
which is too much for most people. However, 1 think that the
way that our communities at: set up are not only antithetical
to the development of strong communities but also damage
the environment. Things do not have to be this way. I be-
lieve that we can develop neighborhoods that both promote
healthy and friendly communities and actually improve the
environment rather than damaging it.

i believe that we can make our communities stronger by
walking and biking more and driving less. When you walk
more, you see people around and talk to them. Rather than
driving straight from your work parking lot to your garage at
home, you pass by people and places and experience them on
a differentlcvel than from a car. You notice the changcs in the
seasons more. Just walking or biking a little bit every day also
is good for your health~a very important benefit in a coun»
try where according to the National institute ofDiabetes and
Digestive and Kidney Diseases 31 percent ofadults are obese
and no percent overweight.

{course this all sounds well and good but when you
want to get somewhere, odds are you will reach for rho car
keys out of convenience. What is the 50*
lution to this? Redlite the convenience of
driving, Some may cry foul with claims
of socialist control of personal life, but as
we have all—hopefullyilearncd from our
mothers—doing what is convenient is not
always what is best for us. certainly adults
are better at realizing this than children,
but evidently not enough (see obesity fig-
ures above.)

Therefore, I propose vastly reducing
the number ofroads in our neighborhoods
and having people walk or bike to park
ing lots next to main roads instead. lncon-
venient? Yes, Better for society> Maybe
People could still drive cars up to their
houses'tor large deliveries and such but for
that you would only need one lane. Alleys would disappear.
The elderly could cluster in houses closer to the parking lots
since it is less convenient for them to walk (although cone
tinuing to exercise into your later years can help prevent the
deterioration of the body). Everyone would be within five
minutes walking distance of a parking lot and most would
be within two minutes,You would be surprised at how many
roads this eliminates, saving lots of money for maintenance
and snow removal. We would still need to remove snow from

these one—lane roads but it would be a smaller total area
and there would be no cars in the way. See how few roads
Grinnell would have under this plan (roads adjacent to the
still commonly used roads would be converted to parking
lots.) is walking 10 minutes every day really that difficult?
This is just an idea and it would work better in a community
that was designed for it, but I wanted to throw it out there.
Reducing the prevalence ofroads in our communities would
have other benefitsiit would be safer for children and would
reduce rapid runoff into local waterways—a major ecological
problem.

Also, although they look green, most American neighbor-
hoods are deserts for most life forms.
The native environments oflowa (prai-
tic, savanna and woodland) contained
a couple hundred species of plants and
thousands of species of insects in every
acre. That acre would have been visited '
by dozens of species of larger animals
every year. from birds to the magniflr
ccnt bison and elk, An acre oflnwn has
maybe a dozen species of plants (un-
less you spray it u lot, in which case it ’
only has one) a few specics of insects
ilntl rabbits. Water runs off of lawn much fnster than off of
native ecosystems, stressing out waterways
Most Americans only know nbout a dozen me
tive species of plilnt57if that—meaning that
we are largely ignorant of a huge part of our
natural heritage.

For these reasons, I suggest that we stop
using non~nativc planls in our landscaping.
People might say, “but that’s what we have nae
turc reserves forl"lt is true that there are nature
reserves and they are very important. However,
as suburbs gobble up more and more land~
and especially in lowa where most ofthe land’s
already been gobbled up by row crops)—srnall
islands of nature just don’t cut it. Would you
rather see your yard as strangling out nature or
as a natural paradise? Also, the nature reserves
are not doing rheirjobs as far as educating the
public goes, People get to know things that they see every
day, not things that they visit once a month. Why not just use
non-native plants that aren't lawns? 400 species are depen-
dent on a speciﬁc kind of tree in Australlaihere it is used
by less than 10. Native plants are designed for this place and
have many complex interactions with many different species.

What about lawns for kids to play on? We could retain
lawns in parks for children to play ball type games at. This is
better than playing in the wrd anyway, since kids would play

‘ Traditionalist

with other kids at the park, which is good for their social der
velopmenc Also, children can play in a non-lawn yard as well.
In fact, it is much more stimulating to play in a varied envi-
ronment that is constantly changing than playing on a blank
slate on which you project your games. As a child, I grew up
in a second growth forest east of Seattle and was fascinated
by the insects,ﬂowers and ferns I saw. I like to think that this
is part ofwhyl love nature so much today. My neighbors had
lawns but I never played in them, preferring to pick blackber-
ries and thimbleberries instead. Only when we moved into
a more typically suburban environment did I start to play
games on lawns, Believe me, children do not need lawns to
survive—they had gotten
by just fine for millennia
before the lawn was even
invented.

1 don't want to pore
tray this as the only way
to organize a communi-
Q’iln Europe they have
a very different way of
organizing their comuur
nities, which seems to do
a pretty good job of pre-
serving the envlronrncnr, (mdillon, health and community.
This is just one idea of how to make an American way of
organizing our communities that avoids sonic of the prob
lems of our current system. I welcome people's alternativc
ideas and criticisms,

You may ask what you can do about this. on a grand
scale, you can push local governments to move away from a
road centric system. on a more personal level you can start
trying to walk and bike more than driving.Try making a rule
where you don't drive anywhere that's less than a 20 minute
walk/five minute bike ride. For example, bike to Fareway and
just balance the bags on the handlebars or get saddlebags
rather than driving. As for native landscaping, many ofyou
are students who do not own property. However, you can ask
your parents to try it or can try it when you get a house of
your own. Startwith just 500 square feet, Native landscaping
is still a fairly new field so the process is something of an
adventure at this point, but it's worth it to change a piece of
lawn into a wildﬂower oasis.

After doing a small piece you can decide if you like it
and expand it or you could convert it back to lawn easily
if you didn't like it. But I’m pretty sure you’ll come to love
native landscaping once you get to know it. Every year you
Will notice new species appear and every week during the
