What were some of your goals when you ﬁrst came into
the college?

I did think the place needed to do better on diversity. There
was so much rhetoric and the results were so poor, that was one
thing. Second thing, we obviously had a lot of ferment of plan-
ning that started actually before I came that revolved around
buildings at ﬁrst and then was also aboutiwas the curriculum
in need of augmentation or change or modernization I think
those were second and third goals. 1 always thought that this
should be a town that contributes to the community in which
it exists. A healthier city of Grinnell will be good for Grinnell
College and also again it’s the appropriate thing to do. Those
were probably the four biggest goals.

It‘s interesting, because something came up when you
were talking about your goals. In a February piece for Forbes,
you advocated for fewer largbscale buildings, yet the college
is finishing the construction of a s77 million athletic facil-
ity, and duringyour tenure. there’s been szoo million of con-
scruction.

This has been Grinnell's history. Grinnell is not like a lot of
p1aces.We're not a constant construction zone.Wc have tended
to build a lot ofthings all at once and then not build very much.
thn l camc in,wc had essentially gone 40 years without mar
jut construction. We had done two signiﬁcant projects, when
my predecessor was in ofﬁce. One was to start the Science
Center Project, she did about half ofit. The other was Bucky
baumilhe fine arts center. But our facilities were in need of
signiﬁcant renovation.Why? For one thing, students no longer
like to live in quads,so you had to add more residence halls and
reduce the number of students ‘in the roomsl think students
are right. You had to add more bathrooms.

The way people live their lives has changed. Most of our
reSldence halls are seventy, eighty, one hundred years old. We
had to modernize, A third ofthe residence halls are not acces-
sible for students with a disability at all. Fourth, our class size
has changed dramatically since rho close ofWar II. We used
to teach classes of60. 70. 80. We don't do that anymore. All of
our classes are 25 or less. Our average class size is 16 [u] And
the shape of them is oil. We no longer lecture. Most of it is
discussionThird, a lot of the legal rules, like our athletic center,
have changed. Our pool is not long enough, not wide enough,
to technically host a competition Out indoor track cannot be

used as an indoor track because of the design of it, which

is uncorrectable. It's too narrow and it encourages people to
develop injuries because there is too tight of a turn.

So some ofit was necessary. The goal ofall ofthis was not
to turn a small town in Iowa into Manhattan, but to make sure
that the buildings continue to serve the needs ofa residential
college of about 1,500 students, and that didn’t change.

I remember one student said to 1116.6“ an open forum
at the beginning ofthe residence halls, “Why the heck are we
building more residence halls,why are we wasting that money?"
So I said “how many people [are] in your freshman room?" and

- he said “Four," [...] I said what did you think and he said “I

wanted to drop out".

That’s no one‘s faultv that’sjust how society changes. When
I grew up, kids shared bedrooms with their brothers and sisters
all of the time. The average student who comes here has some
experience, but much less experience, so that reﬂects itself in
the kind ofhousing.

Having said that, we might do one or two more projects,
butI think we’re going to outer a nonrbuilding period, and it
should go on for along time. Because we’ve done a lot, and it’s
time to step back, not spend money on that. Absorb these new
buildings.

What are we doing with our library, should it be bigger,
should it be difrcrcnt. should it be replaced‘ That's a very ex-
pensive project. Two, we need more classroom modernization
in ARH and Carnegie, and more sophisticated computational
labs,

In your time here, a lot of money has been put toward ﬁ-
nancial aid as well. can you tell us why thats been a focus?

Grinnell's history was that it wasn't as well offas it is today.
We were not need-blind, And then at some pointiprobably
near the end of George [Drake ‘56]'s presidency—tho endow»
merit started to rise, and we started being more generous abotir
financial aidlt’s a setofpolicies that we now articulate as being
nccdtblind. When l came, those policies were in placeilhis
tremendous consensus for those policies for domestic students.
But my observation was that our students were graduating with
too many loans, even with those policies. So my own focus has
been to try and figure out how to push down the amount of
loans, because ideally I think everyone should graduate with
undergraduate college with no loans, zero, in could control the
world that's what I would do.

You have so many choices to make in your life—[such
as] graduate school, and you’re going to borrow for that. Or,
you might want to go to work for Teach for America and I
know you get loan defcrral for that, and your life should not
be hemmed in by big overhanging loans. So it's a combinar
tiou otour history and my own views. And I think it's a broad
community consensus that generous financial aid is a hallmark
of this place. [With] international students, it's more compli-

catcd, When I came here, we were covering roughly 50 pets
cemt of the [financial] need of international students. That’s
been increasing. But it’s a daunting prospect to cover the full
need of all admitted international students and no one does it.
We’re one of the few who does it for domestic students. A lot
of our peers havejetnsoned it in my time~including Oberlin,
Carleton, and Macalesterithose are our three biggest overlaps,
and they‘ve thrown it away.

Talk about Oberlin, Carleton, and Macalester. Two of
those three schools' presidents were recently featured in the
Wall Street Journal. As.werc you—you wrote an admissions
essay, which I thought was very important for prospective
students trying to get a leg up on the campeﬁﬁoni on how
to write an essay. I think that did a lot for Grinnell's national
reputation,Why did you make that decision, to write that es»
say?

We reach out to the national media a lot,We have a media
ﬁrm in New York that advises us because that's how people like
the two of you make decisions although you may not know, A
lot or students say “Oh, i don't like [public relations] stuff," so
I say “How did you decide to come here?" and they say, "Well,
I was reading this book about undergraduate colleges and it
sounded like a neat place."

Well you're not craech have to be constantly reaching out
[to] all media, not just thc Mil/Sllcclfamlml, but digital media.
the web, everything, to say, "Well, this is a neat place, if you
want to come. It isn't necessarily tor everybody" So when this
opportunity came up I immediately wrote about it.

In the Forbes article I mentioned earlier, I also noticed
this “three-segment academic calendar” idea. We've talked a
little bit about ﬁnancial aid and about your belief that stur
dents should graduate with no loans. To make that a more
feasible idea, maybe the three-segment calendar would help
us graduate earlier. would you like to elaborate on why that
would be beneﬁcial and the speciﬁcs?

Let mejust say that the president in places like this does not
set the calendar, generally. It is mainly a faculty responsibility.
I am not convinced, I'lljust be honest, that two fourteen-week
semesters is the best way to deliver the education, forget wheth-
er it would save money, just educationally. Now, every place I've
taught at has used the fourteen-week segment. I have done
accreditation reviews at places like the University of Chicago,
which has the three segments, and I'm pretty impressed with it.
Iwould like this place to consider are calendar. IfI were presi-
dent still, I would not be able to and would not mnt to dictate
the solution. But I would shorten the academic year, I think
we’re here too long, 1 think the winter break is too long; i think
it should be a substantial break but not as long as it is now. I’m
not convinced we should have a two-week break in the spring.
And Iwould look hard at, should we have a trimester approach?

But it has strong opponents, typically; interestingly I’m lead
to believe in the sciences, who like the fourteenrweek system
better. But in the courses I've taught in history and political scir
once, I think shorter courses might be a better option,

Is this something you would recommend to Dr. Kington?
I know you told him coming in that you wouldn’t necessarily
tell him to pinpoint that issue.

Here's my view of college prcsidents~l don't think you
should stay in ofﬁce for too long.I think you have a lot ofpowcr
when you're in otfice, and 1 think it's great when someone new
comes in with all new ideas. No one will ever hear what I say
to Dr. Kington. And 1 Will be honest with you, I’m not going
to press him hard "do this do that."I don't think that’s how the
system should work. I think he should come in, should listen
to you guys, educate himself. He brings a whole set of life ex»
periences different than mine, and that's fantastic. He’s a doc-
tor and I’m a lawyer, that’s fantastic. He's AfricantAmerican,
I’m not, that’s fantastic. It would be presumptuous of me, if he
called me up and said "Russell. there's this guy named Marcus
who's driving me crazy, tell me about Marcus,"l would respond
to that sort of thing, but I would be unlikely to tell him, “you
should do this." and by the way ifanyone ever calls me after he
decides something and says “do you think that’s a terrible idea?”
you’ll never hear me say a critical word about Dr. Klngton. My
job is to support him completely.
