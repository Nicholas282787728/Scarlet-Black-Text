Baseball 6-0 in
conference play

BY DARWIN MANNING

Like those students who nctunlly worked
hard at the beginning of the semester and
got A's on all their assignments, Grinnell’s
baseball squad couldn't be happier with
where they arcThe squad is one in Confere
ence play and 15711 overall and with the
roughesr part or the regular season over, the
team is confident heading into the romaine
ing nine games.

“I’d be surprised it we lose more than
two games for the rest of the season, be-
cause we've gotten so much better," said
pitcher Ben Pope ’12.

In addition to the success on the field,
the Pioneers also fulﬁlled the four goals
that Coach Tom Hollibaugh gave them at
the start of the season.

“We had four goals from the starterhe
first was playing every game to win, second
having fun playing together, third keeping
things simple by not looking ahead and the
fourth was taking care ofbusiness one game
at a time, Hollibaugh said.

The teams recent success can be partly
attributed to their schedule, which was par-
ticularly difficult during their Spring Break
trip, including two games against last year's
Division III Champion, the University of
St, Thomas. Despite the competition, the
team ﬁnished the trip with a record of Sci).

"We intentionally made the schedule
more difficult, because we wanted to com-
pete against harder teams, to prepare us for
our Conference opponents,” Hollibaugh
said.

It appears that the tough early schedule
paid off—since returning from the Spring
Break trip, the team is 9-2 at home and on
the road.

“The offense has been consistent
throughout, not being shutout and scoring
at least three runs per game," Pope said “I

think our pitching could be deeper, but for
a D3 team we are pretty darn good"

This past weekend Grinnell’s squad
played a double header at Illinois College,
in which they dominated both games, 1271
and 10»3,Thcy then played Coc College at
home and were handed only their second
loss in the past 11 games, 3-8.

“Coe was deﬁnitely better than [Illinois
College]. bur I don't feel they're better than
us,"Pope said. “It sholild have been a close
game, bllt that's just the way baseball works
out sometimes."

Pope saw a lot of success this season,
with a 1.49 era and a H' record over six
games started and his control over his
cutveball and changeup came along way.

“In my t’reshmen year I was a bit nctr
vous, thinking, “This is college; bur in real-
ity I just had to realize that I don't have
to pitch around guys and that I can throw
it right in the Zone and challenge them,"
Pope said

offensively, the team has been successful
throughout, and Greg Suryn 11 feels that it
improved thanks to the chemistry that the
current starting lineup found. Suryn, a key
contributor this season, posted a .451 bate
ting average and says that his success has
been due to Coach Hollibaugh’s focus on
situational hitting.

“My most important role on the team
is being a'situational hitter," Suryn said.
“That means knowing what the siruation is,
if I’m the lead off batter it's getting a hit
and if there's men on second and third it's
getting them in."

it doesn't appear that the headaches to
which they’ve been subjecting opposing
pitchers will end anytime soon

“I’m pretty conﬁdent rhat our whole
lineup can hit the ball—even out nine-hole
has two home runs this year, and ir gives me

conﬁdence that I can just throw strikes,”
Pope said.

coach Hollibaugh emphasized focus at
the plate and waiting for the right pitch as
opposed to trying to do too much

“The only team that can beat us are
ourselves,” Hollibaugh said. “Against [11-
linois College] we had a good approach at
the plate, but looking at the Coe game, we
needed to be more patient at the plate.”

The last goal for the team is to continue
their perfect Conference record and play
host to Conference on May 14715,

“Hosting Conference is a pretty big
deal, because the mounds at other places

are terrible, at [Illinois College] the' mound
is like a nipple, and later in the game a hole
develops where you step, forcing you to
throw upwards," Pope said.

The Grinnell squad is looking forward ‘
to three games at home this weekend, a
double header against Ic on Saturday 10
and 12:30 am, and then a 1 pm. start-
time against nonrconfcrence opponent,
Cornell College. If the team can complete
a sweep ofthe games on Saturday they will
need just one more conference win to host
the tournament.

Golf team ready to surprise at Monmouth

BY MICHAEL SCHOELZ

While Tiger Woods‘ misfortunes may dominate the na-
tional headlines and even an appearance in the scans the
Grinnell Mens Golf team has had plenty of misfortune of
their own Injuries, theft and historically low numbers have
all plagued the team. However, the Pio—
neets will arrempt to put all that behind
them when they travel to the Fighting
ScokPrairie Fire invitationalitheir
final tournament before the Midwest
Conference Championship—hosted by
Monmouth College and Knox College
at noon on Friday in Monmouth, III.

"This weekend we get to play against
the top [conference] teams on the same
course and see how we stack up the week
before conference,"1an Luby"13 said.

This tournament is especially impore
tant because it will be the first time that
the team will face some of their MWC
opponents such as Monmouth and
Knox. But the focus isn’t on those other
teams—instead Head Coach Brian Ja-
worski expects his team to focus on the
team‘s success

“It’s going to be fun to see how we
stack up against Monmouth and Knox
on their home turf,"Jaworski wrote in
an c-mail. “But the truth is that no team
will have any effect on how we play this
weekend, My expectations for our team this weekend arc
the same for any team I coachiget yourselfmentally ready
to compete, s'tay in the moment and play to win, I know my

guys and they'll be ready."

jaworski's conﬁdence is rooted in the Pioneers' perfor-
mance throughout the season.With their team score of301
in their victory in the Des Moines Area Community Cole
lege (DMACC) Invitational, the Pioneers proved that they
could shoot with the best schools in the
area. The Pioneers hovered under the
320 mark for rest ofthe season, but have
steadily chipped away at that numberr It
was the first team championship in over
20 years and the victory did a lot to re-
shape the mentality of the team.

“No one can take away from us what
this team has overcome this springivan
being stolen, clubs gone, sickness, MCL
injury (Peter Marsho ['121), toe injury
(Nathan Clubb [11]), our home driv-
ing range closed all spring," Jaworski
wroter“But not one single team member
complains, feels sorry for themselves, or
looks to find an excuse for the days we
wish we would have played a little here

“Now that we‘ve done it, it's like this
isn'tjust a hopeiit’s something that we
can legitimately do," Ethan Kenvarg '12
said. "I wouldn’t say it’s an expectation,
but...there's no reason for us not to and
if we just concentrate and play well, it
could happen And everyone on the
team is feeling that and that vibe is really good."

Lastweekend. in the Buena Vista Invite, the team placed
12th out of 24 teams with scores of 317 on the first day

and 316 on the second, but they did so Without Kenvarg
or Marsho. Kenvarg, whose clubs were stolen over Spring
Break, recently recovered his clubs and will be able to play
this weekend. Marsho also recovered from his MCL tear
enough to join the Pioneers at Monmouth.

“l’mjust hoping to go out there and get a feel for tour-
nament golf again and being competitive," Kenvarg said.
“on everyone’s mind is how the other opponents in our
conference are doing—what numbers are they putting up,
how are we competing with thatmbut I think we’re come
ing into it now with a mindset of how are we doing as a
team...and that's going to allow us to focus on our game,
every stroke, taking it easy. "

Kenvarg attributes the success that this team experi-
enced this season to a strong year last year combined with
stronger team mentalityisomcthing that Coach Jaworski
began emphasizing very early this year.

“We lost a lot ofpeoplc at rhe start ofthe year, we had
a talk and Coach Jaws said that one of the big weaknesses
on our team was that we weren't a team," Luby said. “And
this year, with this being the seniors last chance, Carlos
[Lu '10] and Pete [Kieselbach 10] are really working to
make' it a team and its working.”

But perhaps the most important aspect of this tournlk
ment will be to tune this team up one last time before
the MWC Tournament, Bur Jawotski believes that after
everything that has happened this season, his team will be
ready, as individuals and as a group.

“We are right where we want to be heading into the
MWC Tournament,"]aworksi wrote. “We‘re battle tested,
we're strong together, we know we can do it, and we have
something to prove.“
