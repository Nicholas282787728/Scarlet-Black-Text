Thank you for taking the time out to sit
with us.

Not much longer will I be President
Osgood.

I thinle you stay president forever.

That maybe, but I’ll be Russell os-
good again, which is very pleasing to me.

The weather’s been beautiful. Have you
and your red shorts been out, with the
dogs?

Yeah, I have as a matter of fact. I
showed up at the track meet with two
dogs and red shorts and then I went
home and had to come back with blue
shorts and the do s because I went
swimming in the re shorts.

Did you get those dogs while you were
here?

All of my dogs are lowaehred farm
dogs. They are Cairn Terriers. C terriers
are big in Iowa, probably bigger than in
any other state. Probably because they
are too little to bug farm animals, but

. they are great ratters so they kill rats on
farms. So they are very common.

Did you start collecting the red shorts
when you came to Grinncll?

Here's the real story. I run early in
the morning, really early. And I refuse
to put a reﬂector on. Someone said, “No
one will ever see you." I thought, “Well
what can I do?" So I started wearin red
shorts, or for a while I had white s orts
that I would wear running. That’s how it

got started.
When was that?

I started running
when I was a fresh
man in who ’, are ou
ready for that,’196§l.

A more serious uesr
tion, can you tel us
a little bit about your
time at Yale as an
under raduate, then
the a , then law
school, t ion Cornell.

Yeah, I could fill
our tape for hours,
l was .r hip y under
trraduatc. The one
fund .of cloud on the
horizon was the Victr
nam \Nai was buildlnt7
up. 1 can't say I had
given a lot of thought
to what I was oing to
do right outo college.
I thought I was going
to' go to law school or
graduate school in his-
tory.

So it came to my
senior year and the
war was at an [apex].
But Nixon was elected

resident. And no one
, . . ere remembers this,
but Nixon was sort
of promising he was oing to end the
war. That seems odd or a Republican,
but that was in effect what he was says
‘ maybe in a violent way, but he was
oin to end the war. In my senior year,
tghe graft was there, so I was drafted, but
just before I was inducted I volunteered
to join the Navy

By the way, then the war starts to re-
ally end, so by the time I go on active
duty, they don’t want me, or anyone,
they’re trying to get rid of people. So
that turned out to not be a big thing, but
I was in the Navy then. It was the most
important experience ofmy life. Because,

grew up, not in a rich family, but in a
moderately well-off family, in a suburb.
There were never poor people. I had all
of my grand arents, it was a big, success—
ful, extende family. The only two racial
minorities in my town were two daugh-
ters of black maids, and they were in high
school with me. There were no Asians.

So I go into the Na , and I'm in this
division of 25 sailors. one of them had

raduated high school. They were all

‘nds of eopleiAfrican-Americans,
Eoor Appa achians and southerners. I

ad one guy with no teeth. I had guys
who were in bankruptcy, who were bee
in divorced. And here I am, 21 years

1 ,and as I said, it was the most imporr
tant experience of my life. I really llked
them, we had a great time to ether, and
I learned that there is this w ole world
that I don’t know much about.

I learned a lot about life and how you
relate to eople in those two years. I was
only in the Navy two years because they
threw us all out cventuall because they
had too many soldiers. Ad of my sailors
were trying to stay in because it was ajob.

I came out, very suddenly. I didn’t
know I was oing to come out, and I
made a sna lfFecision to go to law school.
I went to ale Law School because it was
very small. I ot into Harvard and Yale
law school an I went to Yale Law School
because it was very small. And I had gotr

 

tcn married to my junior high school,
high school, college sweetheart and we
alread had 1.5 kids. So, I thought, law
schoo is shorter than graduate school,
this is how] make decisions in life. And
I think it was the right thing.

Then I became a tax lawyer in Boston,
then I became a facult member and the
test ou know about. s an undergradu-
ate, majored prettyhcavily in English,
History and literature, and then I took a
lot ofmalh courses. All ofthcjobs in my
lrfc have revolved around math and Eng-
lish lllsmry, so the thing that I would say
to _ udents hair, you think, “I don't know
where I'm going in life" and that's true in
a minor sense, but in a major sense, you
understand yourself better than anybody
else, and you're usually pretty close to “CT

'Culiltc about what you’re interested in,

At some point rifrcr I hatl been teach—
ing along timc,I became the Dean ofthe
Law School, so I did that for 10 years,
and then 12 years as the President here.
I am ready to never be in ever adminis
tiator again. I’m not at all unhappy with
it. Ijrist, when I started out, if someone
had said to me, “It’s goin to be 22 years,"
Wow.I always assumed would go back
and be a faculty member and that's what
I’m going to be doing.

How did your 10 years before Grinnell
in an administrative position pre are

you or not prepare you for wor 'ng
ere?

"It was ret ood re aration. It was
a little bitgliffgegnt. I’th nit trying to in-
gratiate myself with ou, but I basically
ike dealing with un ergraduates better.
They are more interestin than law stun
dents, and I love law smgcnts, so this is
not a negative comment about them. I
knew that before I came here because I
had tau ht undergraduates at Cornell as
well as aw students. So that was a ood
change. Having more of an array o dis—
ci lines is something that I like because I
lilEe lots of different thingsiTo be honest,
I like the liberal arts format a lot because
you're not tradin off good things at one
school for good t in s at another school.
It’s one school, and like that.

One of my favorite things about your
tenure here is that you've managed to
compete with all of these other nation-
ally acclaimed liberal arts colle es that
are located in densely populate , coast-
al areas. Grinnell is in the middle of the
cornﬁelds, one of the most

ethnicall homogenuus

states. H)ow have you man-_

aged, and why is diversity

so important?

I would just start off and
say that, one of the irrital»
ing things when I came here
is that you would hear. two
things about diversi . One
group would say, “ e are
at ground zero, we haven't
done anything." That was true by the
way. And then shortly thereafter they
would say, “It‘s hopeless."Because, fill in
the blankiwe're in Iowa, we’re not near
a big city. Well the most ethnically di-
verse liberal arts college has always been
Amherst College, which is not in a bi
city, although it’s in a more populate
state. So the idea that your precise geogr
raphy makes it impossible struck me as a
bad excuse for not tr ing.

Then, the other t ing I learned a long
time ago in life, is if you say something
will never happen, it will never happen.

It's a self-fulfilling rophecy. The other
thing about Grinnclfthat was odd is that
we actuall had a more diverse past. Back
in the mills we had many more African—
American undergraduate students. We
had nevcr had a lot of Asian students,
and there weren't that many Hispanic
students. So those were areas that we
would grow inevitable, but there was no
reason why we couldn't have more Afrir
can- American students.

The other thing 1 would say, and some
would disagrcc,is that there was never any
opposition here in the faculty or among
students. You think, “Well, there are bars
l'lcrs,"The barriers- here were strictly syn
chic.Thc coplc thought that we couldn't
succeed, ‘Ilwing said that, that was one
thing. The second rhing is,I think before
1 came and pro lc started to think more
about it, we ha n't done enough to focus
on roccsscs by which we hire people and
lool: for students. Ever one sa rs, “Let’s
glft more diversity."well, how c you do
[ lit.

1 think that the faculty have done
an excellent job in making that m,
ccsses more likely to turn up candi ates
and then more likely to hire them. The
students were always going‘ to work out
more quickly, why 0 you t ink that?

Because it takes seven years.

Exactly The number of diverse stun

_ dents in the applicant ool is changing

dramatically every year. f we couldnt do
better, we were losers. That has now also
begun to happen in the faculty pools, but
the student pools chan c more quickl
than the faculty pools. ou also ick ad
of your students in four years. ou pick
all ofyour faculty in a period of 25 years,
so you’re not turning over as many people
at once.

Why do you think it's so important to
maintain a diverse education commu-

nily?

There are several reasons. For one, I
think it makes, and this is actually the
most im ortant reason—it makes for a
better e ucational experience. You learn
from your fellow students, you learn from
the facul and you learn on all kinds of .
different imensions. You don’t 'ust learn
what they assign you for class. ou learn
in the dynamic in the classroom and in
the dynamic in our residence halls. If
there are more different people, you learn

from that.
Little experience, one of
. - my close friends at Yale Cole
, lege, this doesn't sound like
' diversity but it is, he was
in a horrible car accident
while we were in college. It
left him substantially dis—
abled. I learned a lot helping
him learn to live a new life,
which was a life in which he
was disabled. If ou expand
that out to peo le of differ-
ent races, coming from di ferent coun-
tries, different reli ious backgrounds, you
learn more. The educational argument is
the strongest one.

The second at ument is that it is a
just thing to do. eople have been op-
pressed or denied equal opportunities
and society is here to ensure that every-
one can be on a ath to success in his or
her life. Grinnel should and has, made a
contribution to that.
