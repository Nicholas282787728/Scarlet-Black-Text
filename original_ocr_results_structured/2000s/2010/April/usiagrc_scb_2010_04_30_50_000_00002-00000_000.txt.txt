The 5&8 Presents

Student Staff to rece'

BvJa FRANCls Bust;

In response to campus climate concerns, Joint Board passed
“The Resolution Concerning Campus Climate and Continued
Discussion"on Wednesday, April 28. The bill aims to combine
the pre-evisting support roles ofSrudcnt Staffwith facilitation
of meetings to discuss issues of identity and discrimination on
campus.

“We want to use things that already cxist."suid Luis Vallejo
'13, a sponsor of the resolution. “It's going to impact the next
generation ofGrinncll that comes in,"

The resolution will mandate diversity training for student
Staff. The training will be om: of the many rcsourccs that stu-
dent Staffcan use to support their peers.

According to Vallejo, the idea for the resolution sprang from
the Campus Climate Assessment, in which 35 percent ofstir
dents of color reported being harassed. Another inspiration
came from the success ofihe forum held after the biascmotivutr
ed vandalization ofthc posters ofscA Vice President-elcc't for
Student Affairs (VPSA) Graciela Guzman Yll.

“It was very touching whcn several people showed up to
support Graciela. Imagine ifcvcryont on campus could count
on their ﬂoor if they ever had such similar Situations?" said cor
sponsor CyrilAfeku ’13.“1 feel that Grulnell is [suffering] from
a lack ofcommumty and this would go a long way to help

The resolution also includes a clause that pledges support
for Faculty/staff movements to form groups similar to student
organizations that currently exist, eg. AJust, Real Men, and
Posse.’

The resolution Is the product ofcollaboration hctwoen sew
eral firstycar students, AssistantDean ofSrudcnts and Director
of Residence Life and Orientation Andrea Conner and next
ycar's executive SGA cabinet. Vallejo,who plans to run for Sens
ator next scmestcr. and Afeku, who will be a Student AdVIsor
in Rathjc Hall next ycat, combined their original proposal with
a similar idea under the guidance of SGA President-elect and
current VPSA Ben Offenhctg ’1 1,

“It was [Christian Snows '13 and Kathy Andersen: ‘13's]
idea to have regular dinners/lunchcs m the dining hall. Ben ba-
sically decided to mesh both ideas together into one resolution,
Vallejo said.

This summer during RLC training, Residence life will
decide thc specifics of the training in time for student staff
Training in August, according to Conner.

“we did have onc session with AJust and we had one ses-
sion where Adam Lange ['11] and another student talked about
self gov, 'Conner said referring to lastyears student smfftrain»
ing She said that this year she hopes to triple the number of
training sessions about issues Ofdivcrsit’y.

However, holding discussions on race, class, and gender will
be left up to indmdual staff.

we diversity training

“We're not slamming down requirements on anyone." said
Lange, who will be beginning his third year on Student Staff
next year and has been a leading proponent of the resolution,
according to Vallejo and Afekui

According to Guzman, a previous draft of the resolution
was initially tabled at the April 21 session oflomt Board so that
she and Offenbcrg could collect feedback.

The two attended every residence hall clusters staff moor
ings and tahlcd to talk to students at large about thc resolution
The resulting draft rcmovcd quantifiable requirements for SAs
regarding study breaks, but kept the call for student stafftrnin—
lng,

Our original draft would havc saved a lot ofour relation-
ship with a lot of student staff because it was directly asking
them to do things which we dont want to put on them yet,
Guzman said And I think putting it in training and having
those solutions comc out of them as opposed to Us saying Hey,
we re SGA were telling them what to do [is better]

SAs will have no responsibility bcybnd attending the train-
ing, which is one of several mandatory events during their
week-long orientation.

“In an ideal world, every SA would feel comfortable leads
mg in this situation. And ifthey do not .. . I would want them
to feel like they could meet our expectations in a diffcrcnt way
by asking me to come, a new RLC to come, Alust, or another
identiryrhascd [group] to caine,”Conncr said. “There are other
ways to do this.“

Regardless, Offenberg, Guzman and Langc all agreed that
the majority of Student staff will use the training as part of
their roles as 5A5

“It was overwhelmingly supported," Oftenherg said refer-
ring to responses from current members OfStudent Staff.

According to Guzman topics of racism, classism and cul-
tural differences are often avoided because Student Staff worry
they do not have the ability to properly handle the situation.
Following the training, she believes conversations will open up.

“I think a lot of Student Staff have wanted to be there for
their ﬂoors and for the people in their halls this way, but they
just haven't necessarily had the direct kind oftraining you need
to feel comfortable with that,"Gu2man said.

Conner said she hoped to incorporate facilitation training
into Student StaKTraining when she was hired at the end of
the last academic year. When Afeku met with her two months
ago about the issue, her “instincts were confirmed,” she said.

“There's always a place for baking htownies and painting
your nails," Conner said; adding that the tried-aud-true meth-
ods offloor bonding should increase in frequency. ”But there's
also an opportunity for student staff to be a part oflarger con-
versatrons."
