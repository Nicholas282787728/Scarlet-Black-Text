Russell K. Osgood is not the only important ﬁgure to leave
our midst at the end of this school year—after serving the
Grinnell community for 22 years, Director of Health Services
Karen Cochran will be retiring at the end ofthis school year.

“I think it's a good time in my life to retire," Cochran said.
“I do a lot of things outside ofwork and it feels like the right
Elmer"

Cochran announced her retirement to the college on Au-
gist 10, 2009, prior to the start of the new
academic year. Though Cochran and her
caring demeanor will be missed, the ad
ministration decided to utilize this oppor
tunity to implement some changes to the
College's Health center. starting next year.
the Health Center will not only acquire a
replacement for Cochran, but will also add
new position as well.

The College has hired Stephanie Brown
to take on the responsibility of being the
Director and Lead Psychologist of Health
Services.

“It's the model they decided to set up now because of
Grinnell [College] getting its own Mental Health Services
instead of staying in the contract with Powesheik [County],"
Cochran said.

student body in late April, Brown hails from the University of

Some students strongly believe the campus would directly

benefit from having a hillyestarted mental health services.

“I think that [mental health services] is a valuable resource,"

said Scott Klris '13. “It should be here"

Klas was not the only Grinnellian who believed that men-

tal health services should already be incorporated in the health

services orthe college.

“That would be amazing,” said Hana
an Romodan ’13. “Especrully since a lot
of ﬁrst years need this kind ofresource."

Romodan addressed the fact that the
transition to academic and social culture
of Grinnell can be intimidating. By hir-
ing a lead psychologist, the Health Cen-
ter can start to more effectively address
this issue in the coming years.

"All of [the students] need
someone to talk to, to talk about
their classes," Romodan said

“A lot of [them are] frustrated and lonely"

Cochran has rrequently been asked why she has chosen to

stay at Grinnell for such a large part of her career.
