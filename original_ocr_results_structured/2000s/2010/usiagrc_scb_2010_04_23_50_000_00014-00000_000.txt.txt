Softball looks
for three wins to
make tournament

BY MAX CALENBERG

After a tough season, the Grinnell Softball team will face its ﬁnal hurdle
to the post—season this weekend,when they play a doubleheader against Mon-
mouth on Saturday and another two games against Lake Forest on sunday. In
order to reach the Midwest Conference Tournament, the Pioneers will have to
win three of their four remaining games.

“were going to have to play very well, play solid defense, get our pitchers
dialed in and then keep hitting the ball like we have," said Interim Head Coach.
Craig Arendt,

The women are coming off a tough weekend where they went 2-2 against
two MWC rearns.The squad won their ﬁrst game against Knox 4—3, then lost,
7-10, in the second half of the double header. Against Illinois College, they
{aired similarly, winning the ﬁrst game 978 and then losing Hi.

“I was hoping to win three offour of them, but we did a lot of good things,”
Atendt said. “We‘re still in the thing, and that was the number one goal. to have this
weekend mean something, and it does."

The team scored 21 runs and batted .342 as a team over those four games.
One highlight was Brianna Gallo’s ’11 setting ota new school record for stolen
bases in a season with is so far, topping the previous record at 15 set in 1991
by Dori McClennan,

"She came to me at the start of the season... and she said, ‘I can steal more
hases than they let me last year,’ and I said, ‘00, green light,”’Arendt said. “She
gets a good read on the Catcher and the pitcher and she understands what she
has to do take that base, she is very good, especially at coming from second to
third and reading the short stop and realizing, heyl can beat her."

Most recently, the squad played two games against nonaconference foe
Simpson College at home on Tuesday, losing both, the ﬁrst by a mark ones
and the éeoond. 377. ,

“We like to play teams like that to get better for our conference game,’
Jayme Wiebold '12 said. “It is good to have games in between important week
end games," CONTRIBUTED

No matter the outcome of next weekend, Atendt, who for the two previous I I
seasons volunteered as an Assistant Coach. will not be around next year in his I
patron, a as mi a, a peanut rear oar. menu, We Th e D | c k sat | sf | es Trac k tea m
.way. Regardless of his short stay at the top, Ardent is just happy to be able to ' .

take part.

“I would love to be involved as long as thcy would allow me to be involved
with it," Arendt said. “I enjoy it immensely, 1 played the game for years, coached
the game for years,..l enjoy being around the game and will keep helping out
here as long as they let me do it."

Wiebold said that establishing a long-term coach is the key to building a
successful team and future seasons, but she's glad for everything that Arendt has
been able to do to help the team,

“I hope we can get a solid coaching system, that will really help us,"Wiehold
said. ‘There is a lot ofpotenrial, but now we need to refocus this club to get the
most of that.”

A small team, shaky coaching situation and a plagie ofinjurles resulted in a
tough season for the Pioneers, who now stand at 5725, However. the season is
still not over and next year can only bring more improvement,

"I think our chance ofteaching the tournament increases exponentially next
year, we're going to lose one player but we’re going to have a key group of six
seniors that are going to be the leadership ofthe team that have seen four years
ofvaluable college playing time," Kelsey Montgomery’u said. “We're going to
return wonderful players, both otour pitchers are underelassmen and this whole
year of pitching and coming back next year With that experience Will just help
so much."
