Softball season
plagued by injury

BY CASEY STRICKLER

As the weather gets hot and the humidity reaches a new
high, the Grinnell softball season comes to a close. The
Pioneers finished their season Monday with a split dou~
blc header «3' ist Lotas College. Despite a disappointing
6-28 record, bookcnded with wins in their first and last
games, the Pioneers found many positives about the season,

"We did a lot of good things but 1 wish we could have
turned it into some more wins on the score board," interim
coach Craig Arendt said. “[There were] a lot of positives,
we set a lot ofscliool records and all those people are back
[ncxt scason.]"

staying healthy was the biggest obstacle for a team ale
ready low in numbers.

“What really hurt us were injuries," pitcher Hannah
Bauinan ’13 said. “You can’t account for that."

With 10 oi‘ the 11 players fighting an injury at some
point in the season, the team's primary goal for next year
is to stay healthy and augment their numbers. The team's
growth next year will depend heavily on the yet—to-be-de-
tetmined head coach. Presently, the athletic department is
accepting applications for a new head coach for the fourth
time in three years. The players and the athletic depart
ment have communicated about what the team is hoping
for in a new coach

The team wants a coach “who's going to be committed,
who knows a lot about softball," Bauman said. “[Someone]
in line with Gtinnell’s valttes...somcone who is motiva—
tional."

However, the job listing was not posted until recently,
so the players may not have the opportunity to interview
candidates before the school year ends in two weeks.

“I think that waiting so long to post the job was not
what the girls were looking for," Julia Reese '10 said. “We
were hoping they would post the job sooner so that we
could he more involved in the selection process."

Arendt hopes to continue his involvement with the pro—
gram and plans to apply for the head coach position.

“[Arendt] has shown the most dedication to softball of
any faculty member at this college." Reese said. “I hope

he's involved just because his level of dedication has been
greater than anyhody else’s."

A senior leader, Reese's absence next year will be sorely
felt, though the young team is excited to return 10 play*
ers. “We only lose one senior and she's going to he a tree
mendous loss hut we've got 10 people back that have all
played signiﬁcant minutes." Arendt said. “We're going to
have people that hold school records, there are all confer-
ence performers back next year, and that’s a lot to huild on."

Some of the important players that the team hopes to
build on next year are the three Pioneers who broke int
dividual records this season. Amanda Stromquist '12 hit

6 homeruns in one season, hesting the previous record of
4 set in 2000. Brianna Gallo Y11 stole a record-breaking
18 bases this season, five of them against Washington and
Jefterson college to set the program's single game record.
After only her third season Gallo has eclipsed the record
for most steals in a career with a total of 38, oesting the
previous record hy 13 bases, Kelsey Montgomery'll anni-
hilated two put-out records at ﬁrst base with 336 put-outs
for a season and 697 in her career.

Bauman summed up the feelings of the team tottering
on the edge ofsuccess— “Come see us next year!"

The season ended abruptly and with
much disappointment for the Grinnell
Men's Golf team last Saturday at the Mid—
west Conference (MVVC) GolfChampione
ships. The Pioneers had been anticipating
this tournament all season with hopes of
biiuging home the title. Unfortunately,
they did not perform as well as they would
have liked. However, in a field of nine
competitors they still placed a respectable
fifth overall with a total score of 994,

Head Coach Brian Jaworski said that
the team was disappointed hecause they
weren't expecting their season to come to
an end quite so soon.

"We take responsibility that we did not
play anywhere near what our goal was, [hut
the ream] never gave up," Jaworslti said,
“There is no place to hide on a golf team
and when things don‘t go your way it takes
extra special competitors to keep grinding
and show no signs ofgivmg up,"

At the Wye Championships, Peter
Marsha Y12 was just three shots from the
lead on Thursday, the opening day. on the
second day he fell slightly to six shots off
the lead, and was tied for fourth place in
the tournament. He ﬁnished as Griltncll's
top performer in 15th place with a score of
244. Carlos Lu '10 and Ian Luby '13 both
tied at 27th place With scores of 255. Alex
McDonald ’11 tied for 34th place With a
score of 258.

Marsho, who had a successful weekend
as an individual player, was quick to dis-
count his personal accomplishment iri favor

ofteam solidarity.

“In order to be a team you have to he
ahle to trust every single person. you have
to be an ideal team member."Marsho said.
“[The tournament was] a clear disappoints
incur, we went in thinking we had a chance
ofvictory. But that doesn’t define a season.
We had a lot ofother successes."

The weekend's results aside, the
Grinncll golf team has had a successful
and even historyrmaking year, setting a
new school record with a low score of 301,
They also won the first golf meet title for
Grinnell College in more than two decades.
Pete Kicsclbach '10 won the ﬁrst individual
title for a Grinnell player since 2002,

In addition to their early accomplish
ments, at the end of April the team nearly
matched their new record with a 302 at the
SCOITFHC ClasSic, Along with Kieselbach
and Marsha, Lu, McDonald and Luby led
the team through the season with strong
perfoiiuances.

“I’m disappointed that the season ended
without an ch Championship because
that was our goal going into the season,"
Kieselbach said. "Even still, I've never been
more proud to say I'm a part ofthe Grinnell
Men's Golf team. It's been an honor and
privilege to wear the Honor G logo for four
years, and that is largely hccausc I've been
lucky to have great teammates and a coach
that 1 consider to be a mentor and major
inﬂuence in my life, coach Jaworski, One
tournament can’t and doesn’t change that."
