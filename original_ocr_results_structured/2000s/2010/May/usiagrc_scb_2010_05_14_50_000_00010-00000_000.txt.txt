Breaking up is hard to do: Kramer’s last hurrah

Ah, dear reader, parting is such sweet sorrow. We’v: been
through thick and thin together this year, but we stayed strong.
From LaGarrette Blount decking that dude on Boise State
who kind of deserved it to the Kansas Jayhawks' epic disinans
tling of my Missouri Tigers and subsequent, equally epic loss
to Northern Iowa in the NCAA Tournament, it’s been quite a
ride, I’ve tried to be an engaging columnist, slipping in liipper
references than a “Pitchfork" review and talking about teams
in states that you’re from. My only hope for this column is
that it has atleast provoked an engaging discussion about
sports for you and your friends, probably while you’re all

drunk. But that's OKil know you still mean it.

some people think sports are part ofa solipsistic,
appearance-obsessed popular culture that interpolates
the American people with the dominant discourses
of capitalism, patriaichy and heteronormativity, and
through distraction precludes consciousness of such
issues. But to such effete quacks 1 say, “Huh?"

sports distract us from the drudgery ofdaily life not
as some terrible opiate of the masses but rather as an
enjoyable diversion and exploration of the human
potential. For that, they should be appreciated. To
that effect, I’ve tried to share my enjoyment of
sports with you through this column, and I've
been very ﬂattered to hear seine fans’ (tepid,
sporadic) responses to my work. To echo Ku-
nal's sentiment from last week, yes, our col-
umns have been great. Maybe not great like Tim Arncr, but at
least like Tim Hederman. 1 did it for you, the little people. But
after you brought me so close to your bosom, Grinnell, we must
part 1 hope the following sports analysis will help with what
I'm sure must be a very difficult time. Without further ado, here
are two possible offrseason farewells that might be even more
painful than this one, Don't ever let go, Jack.

Good Night, Cleveland!

One caveat before I begin this section: I have to turn in
my column before the CavssCeltics game on Thursday night,
so I don’t know the outcome of game six, or, if there is one,
game seven. If Cleveland improbably wins both games against
a deeper, more balanced, more experienced Celtics team, I still
think they'll lose to the Orlando Magic. If they somehow mi—
raculously overcome Dwight Howard and Vince Carter, they'll
almost deﬁnitely lose to the Lakers in the ﬁnals. But if hell
freezes over and Katy Perry is die hottest woman on the planet/

the Cavaliers win it all, King James mightjust stay in the Rust
Belt to build a dynasty.

Unless the Cavaliers win the NBA Championship
this year, and maybe even if they do, I think LeBron James
is done in Cleveland, I’m sorry for Clevelanders like my main
man Thomas Neil, but I can’t see LeBron re-signing with the
Cavaliers when he becomes a free agent this summer. The Cavs

don’t have the cap space to significantly add to or al»

ter their current line-up, and Shaq and Antawn
Jamison will be another year older and slower.
LcBron needs an elite supporting cast around
him to win a championship, just like the oth
er great players did. Jordan had scottie Pips
pen and later Dennis Rodinan; Magic had
Kareem Abdul-lobar and James Worthy;
Bird had Kevin McHale and Robert Parish;
Kobe has Pau Gasol and now Andrew Bye
uum, too, LcBron is in the company ofthose
star players, but Mo "Larry l-lughcs"williains
and company aren't on the level of the besr
supporting guys. There is just one team that
can give James the inatimum salary he
will demand and aggregate the right
complementing players to compete
for a championship almost immedis
arelyithe New York Knicks.

James would give himself a better
shot at the title than he has in Cleveland by going to The Big
AppleThe Knicks are in a unique position for the summer of
LeBron because they have enough salary cap room to pay two
max free agents, This means they could potentially add LeBr
ron and Chris Bosh, Joe Johnson or Dwayne Wade and resign
David Lee. Count on G Toney Douglas and F Danilo Gallic
nari developing further, and you've got a contender for years to
come, With such a talented young core and Mike D’Antoni's
highsflying offense, the Knicks would quickly ascend to the top
of the Eastern Conference] still think Kobe’s Lakers would
crush that Knicks team in the 2011 NBA Finals, but probably
not in 2012 At that point, the LeBron-led Knicks will have
the opportunity to create a dynasty nearly as enduring as Dr.
Awkward, my Spring Championship-winning Pub QJlZ team.

speculation as LeBrons next move (see above) recently has

The history books were dusted off and

been possible NCAA conference expansion. Reports surfaced
Monday that the Big Ten had extended offers to Missouri, Nee
braska, Rutgers and Notre Dame tojoin the conference. All the
parties involved quickly issued denials that any offers had been
made, but the incident and the responses from other conferenv
as revealed the fragility of the current conference structure. If
the Bichn expands, it appears that the Big 12 is posed to unite
with the PacrlO in some fashion as iI response to the threat of
a Super Big Ten, possibly including a satellite/cable network
to compete with the lucrative Big Ten NetworkThe Big East
and ACC have said they will not be proactive about conference
expansion, so it’s all up to who, if anyone, the Big Ten invites.

I believe the report from Monday, even iferroneous, names
the most likely candidates ofBig Ten expansion. Missouri and
Nebraska both get the short end of the stick in the Big 12's
revenuersllnring scheme and have a financial interest in join-
ing the Big Tent Rutgers has been trying to push its football
program into the country’s elite, and a jump to the Big Ten
would help in that regard and give its basketball program the
fighting chance it is denied in the cutthroat Big East Notre
Dame really doesn't have an incentive to join the Big Ten ex
cept to arguably provide better competition for non—revenue
sports, which everybody knows Notre Dame doesn't care about
anyway, independence and a separate TV deal with NBC give
the Irish all the money they need and more, so the only wayl
can see the Big Ten luring them is by first getting RutgersThis
would mean the end ofBig East football and thus probably the
conference as a whole, which would force Notre Dame’s hand
and would probably result in the lrish joining the Big Ten, too.
At that point the league would have 13 teams, so I imagine
they would only want to add one more to prevent the continued
problem of scheduling an odd number of teams. At that juncs
ture, I would think Missouri would get the nod over Nebraska.
Missouri has a larger population than Nebraska and thus more
TV viewers and is a better fit geographically. Maybe then the
Big 12 could partner with the Pac-10 to somehow start includ-
ing Boise State, Utah, BYU, in football and New Mexico and
Gonzaga in basketball in a Western Super Conference. Nam-
rally at that point the ACC, SEC and Big East will probably
all start poaching each other tojockey for position in the new
conference world order, Time will tell how this plays out, but
maybe Big 12 Commissioner Dan Beebe will understand what

Raife wins fourth title

able to,“ Raife said,
In addition to maturation on the court this

amended last week when Sam Raife '10 cap—
tured his fourth Midwest Conference singles
ritle, an accomplishment only six others in
the history of the league can boast. At the
same tournament, Raife took home his third
doubles championship and his fourth team
championship. Despite the wave of accolades
though, Raife remains a quiet and humble
teammate; when asked about his history
making match, he applauds the performance
of his opponent and when pressed about his
own achievements, he defers credit to his
team.

"Everyone played well," Raife said. “We
went into the day conﬁdent, knowmg that as
long as we play well and play smart that we
should win and everyone kept their wits about
them. It feels great to win."

As great as wrnning feels, the sensation is
hardly a new one for Raife. Since he stepped
onto the courts his first year, he has proven
himself a veritable force to be reckoned with
both in singles and doubles play. Raife boasted
an intimidating 48-33 singles record and an
equally impressive 3944 in doubles entering
the 2010 season. It wasn’t until this spring,
however, that Raife fully came into his own as
a tennis player.

“I think I’ve developed a lot of more of
an allscourt game, I’ve become more rounded
as a player, I’m a lot more confident in my
tennis game. I’ve developed a more concrete
strategy that 1 know I can use to win. The
confidence has helped me pull out wins,
whereas as freshman or a sophomore I wasn’t

season, Raife also took on a more serious role
on the sidelinesAs the only senior, Raife had
to adapt immediately to a leadership position.

"It’s kind of a new role for me. We had
two strong senior leaders last year, so this is
a whole new experience for me," Raife said.
“I think with the support of my coscaptains,
we’ve worked to create good team unity espec
cially because a lot of the team is pretty young
beyond myself."

As the 2010 season came to a head at the
Midwest Conference Championships, Raife
knew he would be setting a new precedent
for Midwest Conference tennis with his series
of victories, but not without some bittersweet
reﬂection.

“After the match was over it was a sigh
of relief knowing I completed it, but also sad
knowing I was done with at least conference
play in college.”

While Raife may be finished with confer
ence play in college,we can be sure his talents
won’t be left on the Grinncll courts.

“I’m considering trying to teach tennis,
not full time. but as some sort of part time gig.
I hope 1 can at least come back every year for
alumni to meet with the guys and play on my
own here and there."

Rlllfe’s more immediate future is a bit
more relaxed though. His plans for next year:
“I'm going to go into brewing. My plan is
to get an apprenticeship in a small brewery
hopefully in Belgium and eventually open my
own microbrewery,"
