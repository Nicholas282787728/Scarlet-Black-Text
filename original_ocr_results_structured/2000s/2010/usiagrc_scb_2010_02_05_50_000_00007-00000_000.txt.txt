Students, faculty open in Faul'coner

Two'collaborative shows opened in Faulconer this past Friday—one student-run, one faculty run

int EMILY 13ch

Last Friday, the Faulconer Gallery opened two new
exhibits Curated by Grinnell College students and faculty
members. The two exhibits, student’s “Repeat, Reveal, Res
act: Identities in Flux," and the faculty’s “Inﬂuence," while
separate, demonstrate the bond and inﬂuence people have
upon one another. ,

The student run exhibit, “Repeat,” was created by 11
art students in Professor Jenny Anger’s Fall Art Exhibition

. seminar. Held triennially starting in 1987, this unique op»
portunity allows students to use Grinnell’s extensive col-
lections of art located within its print and drawing study
room and shape the pieces they found there into a compre
hensive Vision.

“We do this in the department to give students the ex-
perience otworking with actual works of art and trying
to think through how difficult and how important it is to
display them in a way that makes sense,” said Anger.

However, contrary to past exhibition seminars which
focused on a particular time or place, this year's theme,of
repetition' allowed students to choose from their own in-
terests and relate those to a wide spectrum of time periods
and places that otherwise wouldn’t be connected.

“They took some very abstract ideas about repetition,
and they very perceptively were able to look at the art in
our collection and decide that this theme of repetition was
most interesting when connected with the idea ofidcntity,"
said Anger. ' .

Maddie Cargas '10 agrees that a more coherent theme,
such as identity through repetition,was the most interested
her and her classmates. '

“[It was] very much a class consensus on issues of cula
tural identity, gender identity and racial identity,"said Car»
gas. “Ifyou go to rhe exhibition you can see pieces that deal
with all of those and more." ’

Displayed alongside the studenrs’efforts‘are the compi-

ciplines: They include English Professor Shanna Benjamin,

Reynolds and Catherine Rod, Library. This highly varied
group ofindividuals came together this past summer to 5X,
plore Grinnell College's art collection and create an exhibit
beneﬁcial to their spring semester classes.

“I asked them to develop their exhibitions based on
what they might be reaching this semester,"said Faulconer

Gallery Director Lesley wright. “1 wanted what they put -.

in the gallery to be something that would he a living re
source for their classes coming up."

The faculty members decided to display their artworks
in a fashion following a Renaissance trend known as a
“Cabinet ofCuriosities," in which owners collected and ar-
ranged miscellanea in accordance with their own interests
and method oforganization.

”One ofthe things we wanted to do in our cabinet was
not provide too much information,"said co-curator Librar—
ian Catherine Rod. “We really wanted people to go and
look at the objects and figure out how did they influence
the viewer and how does the viewer’s background inﬂuence
how they look at the different collections."

Although these faculty members come from seemingly
diffcrent backgrounds, through the curatorial process ofass
sembling their separate exhibitions, they realized that the

ways in which their lives connected testiﬁed to the inﬂu-
ence people have on one another.

' , “The Way that their thinking was inﬂuencing one ans
other, the way that their discipline inﬂuences them, the
way that being at Grinnell College inﬂuences them or
that their students will inﬂuence them, all became a part
of their mix, and they wanted people to be aware of that,"
said Wright.

As for the exhibition’s inﬂuence on those who attended
the opening Friday afternoon, sara Lowenburg '13 was
impressed by the array of materials on display from the
Grinnell collection, and surprised by the impact-they had
on her.

”I like that everything is fiom the Grinnell collection
which shows how complex and diverse the collection is,"
said Sam Lowenburg ’13,who attended the exhibits open—
ing reception. “There are so many different interpretations.
The idea of identity is really interesting and something
that you could get a lot out offor yourself”

The exhibits are open from Jan. 29 until Mar. 21.

RUSsi-ans ”run Circles around lyrics

The three-man band coming to Grinnell’s Gardner this Saturday needs no words to cover layered sounds

av MIKE KLclNc

Attentioni

You won't need to speak a second lan»
guage for this Saturday's showiRussian
Circles is an instrumental threespieee
band from Chicago. As a matter of fact,
English isn‘t required either—these guys
just aren’t that into singing so don’t go
expecting to he moved by any deep or
meaningful lyrics. Russian Circles keeps it
pretty basic. It‘s three dudes: a guitarist,
bassist and drummer. Anymore_and they'd
be like any other musical act. Well, almost.

Nowadays, anyone can make a song.
The "one-man band" phenomenon is all
too common and the laptop is quickly be-
coming the replacementsdrummer or even
backup singer for many modern acts. lns
strumental music is nollonger associated

with the jam band or psychedelic outfit.
That was back then—now it's 2010. Ask
around and most kids will probably tell
you that instrumental mu c means that
it’s most likely eleCa
tron'ic. Russian Cir—
cles thinks otherwise.

it all began in
2004 when guitarist
Mike Sullivan teamed
up with bassist Colin
DeKuiper to form the
band. Shortly ,after,
Dave Turncrantz also
joined and took over
drumming duties. In
late 2007, DeKuiper left the band only to
be replaced by Brian cook, ofThese Arms
Are Snakes fame, a similar cohort.’I‘heir

instill-metal”

”0n the Whole, they’re a bit math-
rockty, s/l‘ghI/y almospherit and piys
medal/t arm/rs, burmostimpartanr/y

first record, “Enter"is certainly impressive
and many of the tracks suggest a sound
similar to that ofExplosions in the Sky, ex-
cept much heavier. For aspiring guitarists,
music theorists,
eXadrummers and
general apprecia—
tors of music, this
Saturday should
be fantastic.
Think about
it4how are three
guys supposed
to entertain an
entire crowd for
more than a few
minutes if there is no singing? Here's
how—when performing live, in order to
recreate that rich sound they are known to

produce on their studio tracks, both Sul-
llvan and Cook employ the use ofmultiple
effects pedals and loopsstations to layer
their soundThe end effect certainly reads
like there are more than just three guys
on stage. Side note—it may be hard to tell
two songs apart since their heavy use of
feedback allows for seamless transitions
between songs.

Musically, Russian Circles is posts

'everything. This makes it even harder to

classify them, let alone explain their sound
to the uninitiated. On the whole, they're a
bit mathsrockey, slightly atmospheric and
psychedelic at parts, but most importantly,
instru-metal.
