No rest for Rodriguez

Some people may view college as a
time to kick back and drink beer before
real life sets in. Not Frlda Rodriglezr Ever
since Trustee Robert Austin invited her to
Grinnell and she fell in love with the school,
Frida has made sure to
make the most of her
time at college.

A Spanish and
Sociology major,
Frida has been the
House Coordinator
and Student Adviser
for Spanish House for two consecutive
years, which means that she is in charge of
organizing events and parties at the house
and making sure that everyone gets along.
Some of her favorite memories at Grinnell
are the Cenas Privadas (ptlmte dinners)
that she started two years ago at the house
to help her housemates connect with one
another and desstress. She said that though
many events at Spanish House are open to
the public, the priwte dinners are just for
‘family' members as a way to build a strong
community in the house. Frida explained
that at each dinner members are “supposed

to cook something they totally love and
we eat with the living room with candlelight,
it’s really a lot of fun."

It's good that Frida has the occasional
priwrte dinner to relax, because she is one

busy girl. She is
, the Multicultural
‘ Leadership Council
Liaison, where she
brings in guest
speakers, plans for
the meetings and
prepares for projects.
She also works as an intern at the Office
of Intercultural Affairs, is a member of
the Ambassadors Program, a met at the
Spanish lab, a professor's assistant {or
sociology professor Cook-Martin. a member
or the sociology and spanish SEPCs and
a member of the student Organization of
Latinos/Latinas.

On top of all of that, Ftida ﬁnds
time to shadow and work oneeon-onc
with her mentor Elena Bernal, the Vice
President for Diversity and Achievement
at Grinnell. Though this might seem like
an overwhelming number of commitments,

Frida enjoys them all and is hardrpressed to
pick a favorite activity.

“I like all of them because they give me
different things to do, the interaction that I
have with each ofthem is very different. I've
really enjoyed being in all oithem," she said,

When asked ifshe ever gets any rest, she
laughingly admitted that there is “not so
much ofthat."so is she planning on taking a
break after college?

Not a chance.

This summer, Frida will he an intern with
NASPA, a higher education administration
organization in Washington, D.C., where
she will prepare for conferences and help
to train the next Fellows, or students who
are interested in higher education. Next
fall, Frida will dive into Teachers College at
Columbia University to pursue her master’s
degree in higher education administration.

Though Frida is jumping whole
heartedly into life after college, that doesn’t
mean that she won’t miss Grinnell. She said
that she is “going to miss the people," and
even the “interactions in the classrooms.
Really," she said, “I will miss the whole
Grinnell idea." ,
