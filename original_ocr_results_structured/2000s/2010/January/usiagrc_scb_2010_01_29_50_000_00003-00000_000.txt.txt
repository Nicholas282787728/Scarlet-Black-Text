Haiti
from p. 1

day in Forum South Lounge.

David Harrison, associate professor of French and di-
rector of the Center for International Studies. wanted to
address the larger issues surrounding Haiti and came up
with the idea to hold a panel discussion.

The panel discussion will examine Haiti from various
academic perspectives, with the expertise of faculty mam,
hers Eric Cartcr [Anthropology],Jan Gross [French], Irene
Powell [Economics], Sarah Purcell [History] and Eliza
Willis [Political Science] and will ralte place next Tuesday
in JRC 101 at 7:30 p.m.

“It's important when something like this dominates the
news, for us to try to understand what’s behind Haiti’s eco-
nomic and political situation," Harrison said. “We have a
number'of people on campus, faculty, students and staff
who could provide a broader context and allow rhe campus
to understand Haiti as notjust the site of this disaster.”

Shorh wants to co»lead a service trip to the country,
similar to ReNew, before the end of the year in order to aid
Haiti in its recovery.

“We will try to listen to what we're being told as an
international community what the needs ofI-laiti are and
see how we can respond," Shorb said. “The idea was'to
get the word out as much as possible and invite others to
bring their creativity and their interest and their skills and
their knowledge into a collaborative Grinnell community
effort."

Students'interested in future Haitian relief efforts can
contact the Center for Religion, Spirituality and Social
Justice tor more information.
