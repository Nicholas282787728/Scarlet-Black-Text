Fundraisingv for
Haiti begins

by KATl lERINE CHUNG

Following the College s stated commits
ment to social justice, Grinnells students,
faculty and staff began the spring semester
by launching a series offundraising efforts
and educational events in response to the
Haiti earthquake.

The magnitude 7.0 earthquake, that
struck near Haiti’s capital, Porteau—Prince,
on January 12, 2010 has killed an estimated
150, 000 and injured 194, 000, over a third
of the population according to CNN. As
the Western Hemisphere’ s poorest country,
Haiti largely depends on the outside aid for
recovery from the disaster.

“As a community, the students really
felt that it was time to try to respond as a
Grinnell community to this tragedy," said
Deanna Shorb, Dean of Religious Life.

Fundraisers placed nine donation bins
around campus to collect change from stu»
dents and staff and set up an online dona-
ti'on page for those who want to donate
more than spare quarters and dollars.

A beneﬁt concert will be held tonight
in Herrick Chapel to gather the Grinnell
community and further raise money for
Haiti. Student groups such as Con Brio,
Latin American Ensemble, a jazz trio
called Phoenix Trio, Young Gifted and
Black Chior, G-Tones and Grinnell Singers
will performThe concert will begin at 8:00
pm. and the suggested donation is no.

' As ofThursday, 22 people have donated
roughly 31,300 online on behalfofGrinnell
for a total of about 51,300,]onathan Richr
ardson ’10, one of the student organizers
behind the fundraisers, expects that most
of the donations to come from tonight‘s
beneﬁt concert.

“Hopefully [the donations] will get
around the 35,000 mark, and I would be
very pleased with that," Richardson said.
“But I would also love $100,000. Anywhere
between those two would be good."

The proceeds will be split between Parts
ners in Health and Stop Hunger Now, or
ganizations that are distributing medical
assistancc or food to Haiti

SGA President Harry Krejsa ’10, Ethan
Struby’lO and Richardson started planning
college-wide fundraising efforts days be'~
fore the spring semester.

“It took the support of Elena Bernal,
Deanna Shorb, David Harrison and Sarah
Purcell [who] helped us from an admin-
istrative standpoint, from an institutional
place to make sure we have the support that
we needed," Richardson said.

Because of Haiti's urgent need for food.
water and medical care at this stage ofrcco-
operation, the organizers behind the week's
events assent that financial support is the
best way to alleviate the tragedy.

“This ﬁrst week is primarily about raisv
ing money and about responding to the crir
sis, said Richardson This is rust one step
of whats going to be a long term kind of
awareness raising program around Haiti."

Fundraisers want the college commu-

nity to understand Haiti as more than a’

disaster area. “The Agronomist" by Jonas

ist Jean Dominique, was shown on Thursr

Kim Hinds-Brush to leave at end Of this year

BY ELIZA-EVE LEAS

Grinnell students must say goodbye to a truly
beloved campus feature due to budget pressures,
This time, Grinnell loses more than a few hours
at' the Grille or some money for study breaks.
Instead, it is for-mu RIC Kim Hinds-Brush,
Associate Director of Residence Life and one of
the most prominent ﬁgures at Grinnell. Student
Aﬁairs is not renewing her contract, and instead
will be hiring another Resident Life Coordinator
(RLC) for North Campus.

‘we've been short this year on RLCs and felt
that. So the plan' is to move back to six RLCs
which will cover all areas ﬁilly y, "said Director of
Residence Life and Orientation Andrea Conner.

By cutting Hinds Brushs position, which
was created last year, Student Affairs can pay
a new RLC, as well as‘covet Smounker RLC
Midrael Hunt’s salary He was previously paid
though the Lily Intern by the Center for Relie
gious Studies and Socialjustiee (CRSSD,whiel-l
expires at the end of this year.

Students in Smounker said itwas diﬁicult to
have Hunt 5 lit his time between his RIJC du-
ties and the RSS}, according to elmluations they
completed last year. Canada and Clangrnla also
suffered from the lack of RLCs, according to the
evaluations.

Katie Lau, Assistant Director of Residence

Life and Orientation, manages most of north'

campus with along with the aid of P] Mnhaﬁ’ey
’11, Senior Student Advisor. Mahaiirey‘s position
was created this year to deal with the gap left in
Clangala, because Lau lives in Canada. He keeps
inventory distributed room keys and handles the
trunk room The EBB reported on his appoint-
ment in the September Stli' lssue in 2009.

Even with Mahaﬁ’ey's help, two clusters is
too much for one paid employee to .manage, act
cording to Conner

“Having one staff member oversee multiple
clusters, it makes me worried that there is some
student in crisis that we aren’t aware of," Conner
said.

Student Affairs discussed at least three or
four possible constructions of the coordinator
and administrative positions, and could not ﬁnd
funding to cover all of the coordinator positions
along with Hinds-Brush’s position.

“In order to retain someone with Kim’s ext
patience and leadership, you’re going to want to
promote her and have a salary that’s oomrrrissary
with that," Dean of Students Travis Greene said,
"and Kim, rightfully so, is getting paid at a certain
level that is worthy oflreryenrs ofertperience and
dedication and years of service and loyalty but
that meanswe weren’t able to have certain dollars
to (ill for that Clangrala RLC. "

As a result of mass tumover in Student Af» '

fairs over the past three years,when Hinds-Brush
leaves at the end of this semester, senior students
here will have spent more time at Grinnell than
anyone in Residence Life. In fact, HindscBrush
was promoted in part to introduce the new
RLCs and Conner, to Grinnell culture.

“We had a lot of transitions going on, so we
checked with Kim to see ifshe was interested in
another leadership position," Greene said.

The transitions included a new Dean ofStuc
dents, Greene,a new Director of Student Aﬁairs,
Conner, and a new Vice President of Student
Affairs, Houston Dougharty, as well as four new
RLCs,Dan HirschJVLidiael Hunt, Eric Vos and
Rachel Wike since 2006.

“We're going to be missing out not_just on
the knowledge she provides but the experience
she’s had with students," said SGA President
Harry Krejsa 110. "As much as she’s a source of
insritutional memory, she’s also a counselor for a
lot of the organizations she works for.“

Hinds—Brush advised Student Government
Association, Lyle’s Pub, Bob’s Underground and
the Mock Trial program, along with monitoring
alcohol contracts, determining fees for residence
halls and assessing residence lite on campus.

“She's very focused on what needs to get
done,"Jon Ismail '12 said oinnds—Brush.“That
type of leadership in terms of interacting with

students and having that kind of rapport, that’s
not the type ofvoid thatwill be easily ﬁlled.”

connerwillpick up some ofthe responsibilie
ties, and the RLCs will cover the rest. However, ;
they do not have the'éame level of experience
that Hinds-Brush has, according- to Conner.
“She very competently accomplishes a lot of
projects in her oﬂices that are now going to be
divvied out to entry- -level epop le."

Students admired Hinds Brush ability to
treat her residents as adults while watching over
them at the same time. “She makes sure that
everyone’s safe, but shes also reasonable in un-
derstanding what everyones going to do.They‘re
going to lose the insider’s view on what student
life is like," Loosehead resident Ashur Bratt Y12
said. He described her motherly instinct, and the
care she showed for him and his friend last year
during finals week

SGA expressed Hinds—Brush’s importance
to the College in the letter they posted on the
popular cyber forum GrinnellPlans. "While'
signiﬁcant administrative changes have shifted
around her, Kim has remained grounded as a
well-known and thoroughly-trusted advocate for
students and is without a doubt one of the most
respected and admired public ﬁgures on cam~
pus." Krejsa, Vice President ofAeademic Affairs
Joanna DeMars and Vice President of Student

, Affairs Ben Offenberg wrote in the letter.

~Krejsa wanted the letter to stress to Stu-
dent Aifairs, Hinds-Brush’s im omnce on
cam us. , “we did make clear to Student Afr
{airs that we did strongly believe that Kim’s
retention needed to be a budget priority."

HindsrBrush begn her job search at dif»
ferent institutions across the country, includ-
ing positions for Director of Residence Life.
Considering the two promotions she received
in the past five years, administrators are hopes .
ful that she will land in a good spot.

“I would not be surprised at all ifKim were
to become a Director at another institution,”
Greene said.
