Perhaps one of the most rewarding and entertaining
study break options available to students at Grinnell, Nev-
erland Players, is preparing yet another host of stories Dr.
seuss wishes he wrote. There will be two evening perfors
mances at 7 p.m., Friday and Saturday. and two matinee
performances, 2 pm, on saturday and Sunday.

The members of the cast all seem to agree that the ex-
perience has been irreplaceable. “This is the second time
1 have done Neverland, and considering my experience
with it last semester. there was no doubt in my mind that I
would audition again," Natalie Elsenberg '12 said.

Unlike other plays or productions in which auditioning
can be quite competitive and rehearsal for the show can get
pretty tiring, Neverland Players prides itself on its relaxed
and fun approach to theater. “Actors and actresses are chos
sen through a really short audition process, where we ask
you to show us your childhoodibe open to us and we’ll
be open to you," said director Alexis Leuszler ’12 (Leuzler
co-directs with Johnny Buse ’11, who also serves as Editor
for the SUE.)

Far from an added stress, many cast members found
rehearsing for Neverland a welcome break from the days
to—day seriousness of schoolwork. "Just everyday going to
rehearsal has been really fun, which is really different be-
cause usually during a theater rehearsal, it can get really
tiring, but the rehearsals for Neverland are never like that,"
Grace Carroll ’12 said.

“I think anyone that is in Bucksbaum during our res
hearsal times is can hear how much fun we have during
practice,"Eisenberg sai .

Each production wi last somewhere between 45 min-
utes to an hour and will involve several short—skits. The
preparation for working on a skit involves a special ritual
that gives the performers the chance to appreciate the work
of the elementary school student.

“Before every scene we state the title written by the kid
and the kid’s name, and thus we always start by giving the
kids recognition and praise," Eisenberg said.

The roles the actors and actresses will embody are quite
playful and imaginative. “1 play many different roles rang.
ing from a dog with severe gas, to a door that raps, to a
talking stuffed seal that is more dramatic than anyone I

have ever met," Eisenberg said.

The stories also vary quite signiﬁcantly in subject mats
ter. “Some of them have real interesting topics like writing
a 20,000 thousandsdollar check to Davis and tater tots in
the cafeteria again," Leuszler said. “It’s just truly rewarding
to bring the imaginations ofthese terrific kids home."

cast members are fully anticipating the moment when
they will actually get the chance to perform in front of
the youth. “I’m really excited to have kids in the audience,
because I think they amp up the energy a lot, they laugh a
lot more than adult audiences,” Carroll said. “Since these

are their stories it will just be really cool to have them say,
‘Oh I wrote that one.’"

Playwrights will also be given the chance to come up on
stage for full recognition oftheir work. “After each perfors
mance we ask any playwrights in the audience to come up
on stage. and that's so rewarding, because they have their
parents, peers and Grinnell community applauding their
work," Leuszler said. “It gives them the chance to feel like
they’ve reached this certain creative level where everyone is
exploring their adventures with them."
