Hopi clowns disseminate justice

3v ALI SARGENT

Grinnell College has campus security, New York City has
the NYPD, but the Hopi people of Northeast Arizona have
a law-enforcement system that you would never dare to mess
with—clowns. _

on Tuesday afternoon, around 30 college faculty, staff,
students and community members gathered to hear Profes—
sor Louis A. Hieb '61 give a talk entitled “The Judgment of
Laughter:The Hopi Clown," about rhe role ofclowns in Hopi
culture.The lecture was sponsored in memory of the late Ralph
Luebben, who was Grinneil's ﬁrst ever Professor of Anthropolr
o .
it would probably be good to clarify that Hopi clowns
aren’t so much a physical police force as they are a moral police
force—calling out negative community behaviors during the
annual Katsuna ceremony. They are thus tied to Hopi religion,
which sees the year as divided at the solstices into two halvesi
the period following summer solstice marked by the coming of
the Katsunns,

Kntsunas (pronouncedﬁnd often spelledi“kachina") are
good spirits that, according to Hieb. are essentially “the em-
bodiment ofthe Hopi way" Katsunas, then, are the ideal Hopi
role model. and clowns, or “tsuku,” are rhe exact opposite, since
“the clowns depict life as it should not be," Of the two main
types oftsuku—there are about 12—one resembles the stereo-
typical western clown—a large griinacing srnile painted on its
face with dust—vwhile the other tsuku looks like a cross between
a zebra and a teletubby, with hair antenna; and black and white
striped garments. The Katsuna ceremony has multiple elements
and Is loaded with symbolism, but the basic role of the tsuku are
to usurp the performance plaza form the Katsinas and perform
a variety ofskits that Hieb described as "farcical morality plays
that reﬂect current conﬂicts in Hopi society."

Topics range from language usage—the ceremony is per-
formed in the Hopi language, except when English and other
languages are relevant to a topitchlo gender roles, to traditional
meal preparation, and sometimes target individuals in the com-

munity, their names pinned to a clowns back. There are some
very personal and very pointed things addressed by the clowns,"
Hieb said, citing the example of a skit that critiqued a man for
cheating on his wife.

While the clowns used to deal mainly with conﬂicts and
issues within the Hopi community, the ceremony has been
adapted to address more modern questions, “Today the con,
cern seems to be‘Inore with external boundaries—maintaining

Hopi identity in rhe face oran Increasingly dominant culture,"
Hieb said.

The Hopi do not have an official police force. Rather, as
the title of Hieb’s talk suggests, behavioral standards are main—
tained in part by threat of public humiliationilhe laughter of

the community standing in for the judgment of the court. Hieb'

suggests that laughter has potenrial in some ways to be more
effective than law. “I would never want to be hauled down to
the plaza," Hieb said.

Many are not used to seeing clowns play a serious role as
law enforcement. “it's interesting how it’s a means of social

control," said Becky Lyons ’10, who attended the talk.“It’s dif-_

ferent from what I think of when I think of clowns."

Whnt seems different. however, is actually not so far off
Hieb notes that average circus clowns also critique human be
havior, in a more commoncsensical way, citing slipping on bare
nana peels as the original behavioral counterexample.

The Hopi Concept ofclown as societal critic led listeners to
consider the similar role humor plays in mainstream American
society. “it's kind oflike an SNL skit in away," Lyons said.

Hieh, too, pointed out the Ho -csque clowns hiding like
joy buzzers in mainstream media. People like Jay Leno and
Johnny Carson are clowns dealing with much more secular hu-
mor," Hieb said.

Turns out, that while clowns reveal actions that are deviant
and unnatural within their society, there is nothing that comes
more naturally to society than clowning. “Nearly all Native
American societies had clowns or humor figures in some sense,"
Hieb said. "Clowning is truly a nearly universal phenomenon.”

& Friends fosters art as open discourse,

BY CHRISTIAN CAMiNITI

Grinnell College’s newest art and liters
ary magazine, tstI'eadr, deburs this spring
with the ambitious intention of establish-
ing and publishing a shared creative dis-
course between students from all reaches of
campus.

The publication aims to unify Grinnell
artists through its experimental format.
Initially, students provide an artwork—be
it a poem, a photograph, etciwhich is
placed in the center of a page. Other stun
dents, inspired by the primary artwork, n,
spond wirh marginalia that eventually. after
enough students participate and the page
becomes suitably concentrated, comes to»
gether in a sort of cooperative grafﬁti. The
final product then consists of an array of
varied student voices all conversing with
the original piece.

"We started With the idea that we want
ed to include as many scripts and forms of
art or ways to create as possible." said {3’
Friend; Editor-in- Chief Patrick Kijek 10.
“It s really an experiment in collective arr.

The primary pieces of art for the first
issue of as FI-readr will be poems by Win—
some Eustace ’12 and Paul Tavarez’iz, who
both welcome the unique opportunity to
watch discussion and further creation une
fold based on their work. "Poetry is sup
posed to evoke an emotion, and E5 Friend:
speaks directly to that,” Eustace said. “It
takes the emotion you left someone with
and they give something back. Art can be
a dialogue."

In addition to fostering a singular-

ity amongst the many and varied voices of
Grinnell, editors of [5’ Frimrir also hope to
build an allrinclusive tent for student reprer
sentation. In fact, the genesis of {:7 Friend:
can, in part, be traced back to the feeling
that many student publications tend to be
dominated by rhose with a strong back»
ground in the arts and the resulting desire
for an alternate option.

“Most publications tend to consist of
only English majors," said oi Friend: Arts
Editor Gustavo Arambula ’10. f’We’re try—
ing to incorporate as many majors and
people into the publication as we can. For
example, in the first issue we have a Cheme
istry major who responded to a poem by
writing an equation in the margin."

By offering a crearive outlet to everyone
and anyone, fr Friendi aspires to succeed
both as an art project and a social project.
An ambitious goal, no doubt, but Kijek is
conﬁdent the unique opportunity to engage
fellow studenrs and represent oneself will
catch on and enjoy a time at Grinnell lone
gcr than his own

“After I graduate, hopefully 8i Fricmir
will become a series that fosters a Collective
community, instead ofthe alienated poet or
artist,” Kijek said.

3Frimdr is still accepting student Inar~
ginaha submissions for its first issue which
comes out finals week, Ifinrerested, you can
pick up a page with poetry at the Info Desk.
Meetings will be held on Tuesdays ar 9 pm.
and Wednesdays at 10 p.m. in Forum South
Lounge.
