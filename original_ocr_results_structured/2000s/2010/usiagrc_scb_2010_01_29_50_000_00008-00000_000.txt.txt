The house ofmargaritas 1s certainly
that, ifyou are looking for a good night
out, no place in town serves a better or
bigger marg. The food is plentiful for
its price and can warm you right up in
these cold winter months While the
tacos are not as good as La Cabana,
they certainly give you much more for
the price. Go during lunch for some
superb deals, or on Friday or Saturday
as a great pre—game to the night.

Walking into this brand new insti-
tution, one can already feel a welcoming
atmosphere. Not only Is the aesthetic of
this place wonderful but also the food
The tacos are delectable and do not
pinch your wallet I would recommend
the Super Burrito during lunch along
with Jumbo Marg arita—all for under
10 dollars! In fatng on most days you can
get a 12 ounce margarita for only 81.99!
And unlike its closest competitor, Casa
Margarita, it is located just minutes

from the Grinnell College camius.

The most popular taco place in.the
country is adored by many for its late
hours and cheap eats, Certainly, you
are not going to get the quality of food
that Casa Margaritas or La Cabana
offers but you will get the best bang
for'the buck. Also, this place's quick
service makes it great for a quick bite
when you have way too much stuff to
do. I recommend going on Tuesdays
when hard shell Tacos are only 65
cents!

It's right down the street on Sixth
Avenue, and 'has wonderful hours, yet
chances are you have never heard the
statement, “Guys, I think I am going to
Taco John’s tonight instead of the D-
1-131me:}; be told, the DAHall puts
this place to shame. Anyone who has
taste buds would certainly agree, as I
ate what they call a “Tex—Mex” creation
I was wondering if they were playing a
practicaljoke on me. I recommend stay-
ing away or walking the extra block to
Kum 8L Go and getting the. frozen bur-
rito. Your stomach will thank you.
