RAD course teaches women’s self-defense

nvMicliAELScHoELz

For the past foul weeks on Thursday eve—
nings, l-Iariis Centei has been filled with a
different type of activity. At 4:30 pm, the
concert hall, usually packed with hundreds,
opens up for 13 women. For the next two
hours, the typical noises of parties and move
ies are replaced by discussion and instruction.

With its last meeting yesterday, Rape Age
grcssion Defense (RAD) wrapped up a four
week women's selfedefcnsc classi Taught by
Grinnell College Security Officer Arny Van
Mannen and Grinnell Police Officer Thee
resa Petersen. the class teaches women how
to avoid and escape dangerous circumstances.

“We teach the students basic techniques
that don't require a weapon," Van Mannen
said. “We want to empower them so that they
can help and have more conﬁdence in theme
selves. we spend the first day in the class

ioom talking and then the rest of the class
is getting comfortable and [working on] seir-
awareness.”

The techniques do more than just teach
the class how to hit and draw attention—
they give the women a greater awareness of
their own ability.

“I've never known how far I could actually
go," said a student who is contractually oblis
gated to remain anonymous. “If my ability is
short in one area, the training taught me how
to make up for that in a different area and
that was extremely important for me. , . that
knowledge gave me a lot more confidence."

The class teaches a variety of skills from
how to set up your dorm room to how reee
ognize an unsafe situation before a problem
arises.

“[I’ve learned to] pay attention to details
in other people’s body language, the way

they’re speaking to you and to know your own
comfort zone and what goes beyond that,"
another student said.

Van Mannen and Peterson have been
teaching the class on and off for the last nine
and ten years respectively. They are devoted
to the RAD curriculum and said they believe
that all women should know these basic techs
iiiqucs orselfederense.

“I put my daughter through the program,
and she's 12."Van'Mannen said.

Van Mannen and Petersen’s experience
puts a lot ofthe women at ease.

“They both have strong peisonalities,"the
second student said. “They deﬁnitely are very
vocal and they can both be very physicali I
have a lot ofiespect for both of them."

Van Mannen and Petersen’s roles are to
facilitate a comfortable environment so that
the women can safely exploie their learned

techniques.

“They're always like ‘do it, don't be scaled.
Like. punch haid. be vocal,"’said the first stu-
dent, “I think the way they express themselves
telling us to do this stuff not be scared and
just go out there that vats a big motivator."

Yesterday's class was the culmination of
the program and each ofthe girls fought with
Griiinell security Ofﬁcer Bob DeBerg, an»
other RAD instructor.

“On one hand, this is an environment
where you know you’re going to end up win»
ning,"rhe first student said. “But on the other
hand, when i ﬁrst saw [DeBerg] come out I
was like he is really big, I didn't really freak
out but I was like ‘How am I going to tackle
this problem? It was an interesting cxperle
ence having to ﬁnally apply everything I've
learned and remember it in the actual Sims
ation."
