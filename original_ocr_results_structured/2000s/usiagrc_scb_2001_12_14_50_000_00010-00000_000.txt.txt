Grinnellians? Stressed?
Don’t be absurd

If we really wanted to keep up with our peer institutions, or even if we
just wanted to be reasonable. we should give ourselves a couple days

OﬂThose of you who read my plrn know rhar in rhe
wake of my eolumn of rwo weeks ago. I promised ro
insrirure a lirrle qualiry oonrrol in my lasr column ofthc
semesrer. As I wrire rhis ar ii on Tuesday evening, a
period or rime rhar is looking very much like my lasr
signiﬁcant chunk ofﬁce time unril ﬁnals are over, signs
poinr ro rhar srareinenr being a lie.

Thus far, I have really been unable ro come up wirh
a snirable ropic wirh whieh ro end rhe semesrer. This is
admirredly parrially my raulr, as rhere have been a few
insranees in beiween rhe rruekloads orwork
that I've had some rim: to think of a
ropie and faded ro do so, bur by and
large I blame said rruekloads ofwork.

Now. eerrainly whar I consider a lor
or work a senior would no doubr disr
miss as a parherieally small amounr
(and as such will not be lisred
here), bur considering rhe relze
rive ease wirh which i sailed
rhrough my firsr year here ir
seems like a lor ro me. And be.
cause i was nor adequarely prepared lasr year for rhe
onslaughr rh is year, a vieious eyele ensues.

lr srarrs wirh rhe reeeiving of rhe work, which in
rurn creares srress. For me. ar leasr, excess srress resulrs
in an inabiliry ro sleep properly, whieh ereares a rlred.
unmorivared srare of being. In
this unmorivared stare, little ro
norhing gers done, which brings
the deadline for the work closer
wirhour anyrhing real being no
eomplished on ir, More srress is
rhus ereared, and rhe downward
spiral eonr‘inues.

l’m sure rhis isn'r just my
problem, errher. Everybody ar rhe
school has subsranrially more
work to do around (his time of
year, and while some people are
acrually spurred on by rhe chal-
lenge, ir seems more likely rhar
my scenario will occur Thinking
abour one’x grades and how mueh
work one musr do re make rhem
be or leasr passable is indeed a
very depressing rhooghr.

The professors don’t really de.
serve rhe blame for rhis srare or
affairsiafrer all, it IS the :nd of the semeslcr. Stress is
whar rbe end of rhe Semmrcr is all abour_rurning in
liepagc papers rhar were assigned rhe hrsr week ofelrss,
snidying rhe dneumenrs rhar you only scanned when
you were supposed ro read rhem for class discussion7
and ro ask rhem ro rone ir down would be futile, sinee
in a lor of eases rhe amoonr orwork you have ro do is
your own rauls.
