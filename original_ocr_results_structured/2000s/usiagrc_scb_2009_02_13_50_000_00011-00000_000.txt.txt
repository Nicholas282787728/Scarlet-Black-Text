Flea and praise: on letters, the 3&8, and activism

The staff of the 5&3 asks students to write letters, salutes the B86, and acknowledges recent student involvement

Please write us letters

The letters to the editor sec—
tion ofthe strs provides an open
forum for students to share their
opinions about sues concerning
the student body. Writing a let-
ter to the editor is a great way to
challenge the ideas of thc 5&8,
our peers and administrators, as
well as to show support to the
things that we \lrc‘ad) loic about
Grinuell Collcg '

Though we know it gets a
little old licarinrv that \'ou should
be the clianm: you want to sct‘in
Grinnel1,u yo are looking {or a
new and relat ely simple way to
get involved in the Grinnell eonis
rnunity, writing a letter to the edir
tor is a productive way to do so.

Last week, the StiB received
a letter to the editor concerning a
controversial publication recently
distributed to students. This let-
tcr has since spawned in open
debate about free expression and
misogynous language on campus.

This kind of debate is perfect
for a letter to the editor, and we
hope that it inspires future discus~
skin, so rather than complaining
to your friends about current is-

sues involving the state of the Col»
lege, why not form .t coherent argu-
ment and share your opinions with
everyone.

8&5 you made us laugh

As a student publication, We Like
joy in reading, watching, listening to
and smells
ing other
publications
on campus.

So {at this
year, the
most plot»

:tut sensory .
data has
come from

our negative
image—the Bias.

The Bass is in the unique posi-
tion or being able to openly share
opinions on the state or the college
in a satirical fashion, and we think
that they have done a greatjob come
menring on current events. While
they may make r mockery ofour AF
iicles, satirizc our'fcaturcs and will
undoubtedly larnpoon this editorial,
we'll still be laughing.

So here's to you, Ross, Matt and
Adamikeep it up.

Student activism high

During the recent Trustee week
end, several student groups made prev
seutritions on issues pertinent to the
College SEG talked about their ef~
forts to receive nonproﬁt organization
status, and A Just Grinnoll will train
students over spring hrenk to etlucarc
G r i n n e ll
and the
wider com-
in n n i t y
about soei
justice
sites. These
presenta-
tions were
well re»
ceivetl, and
provided an opportunity for open
debate and dialogue for the students
and faculty alike.

Though Grinnell has a long hiss
tray of social activism, we are not
consistently as active as we strive to
he. However, some student groups are
leading a wave ofinvolvement.

These students are doing some
thing that matters to a wide range
of people. Rather than continuing to
talk about what needs to be changed,
they have taken the initiative upon

themselves. As students, we should
use their examples as a kick in
the butt to actually go out and do
something.

we as Grinncllians have many
resources available for letting out
our inner actiu . Even in these
tough economic times when hurls
get cuts are prevalent, community
service budgets are increasing. One
iCSUlE of these intrease has been
DVA/SAC ability in end their
focus to female members ofMitcll-
eliville Correctional Facility who
are seeking parole.

We are ill constintly straining
under mounds of homework, but
thi ould be no leason to shirk
our social responsibilities. If you
are passionate about an issue, fol—
low these students examples stop
just talking and do something
about it

Let’s finally give [IVA/SAC,
SEC, the Social Justice Peer Edu-
cation Group, and other student
groups the recognition that they
deserve for holding up Grinnell's
reputation for social activism in
ways just ahout everyone can get
behind. And remember, do the
right thing.

Ch-ch-ch-changes hitting Grinnell College campus

Carlos Lu ’10 ponders the effects "of the changes, both physical and social, that are occuring all around us

Hey. do you guys remember a year
ago when Oharnn had just won the

Well, unless you've heen sitting to the

their comeback standup touridon't
worry, they're still touriugiand can't
remember the past 12 months, you
know exactly what I'm referring to:
“Yes We Can" and “Change." Duh.

Yes, I know that thongs is not a
phrase. lt's it Wold. But it's this very
word that I want to talk about, and
what it's currently doing to out be—
loved Grinnell College.

There is no doubt in my mind
that Grtnnell is in the midst of a

eyes to you, oh oh oh), And, our ath-
lctic facilities wrli soon double the

So, Grrnnell, do we like all or
these changes”

Recently/,1 was walking home our:
night with a friend, and as we were
crossing Brh Ave, we stopped to drss
cuss the newlypavcd, hrickroud (we're
off to see the wizard ). as well ilS
the medians that guard the entrances
from Farlt and East St I don't rot
member how the exact conversation
went, but it pretty nurch wear some

thing like tins. “Dude, they should
just block on this street and make it
into, like, a Clock 'outtyald.” “You
mean, like, with benches and pillars?"
“Yeah dude!"

At times, it is easy to iind the
things around us to be ridiculous. lr
can he ridiculous- in it funny way or
ridiculous in an ihsurd way.

in reality, this current i'acc-lii't has
been ongoxng for almost 10 y ars now.
The physical n ~thctics oi this turns

I suspect that as 10ng as the en—
dowment icmums as big is John But-
iows’ love for the students of this
campus, more buildings and more
changes will come. I hope that as
long as Grinnell students know no
limits, that chnnge will he trier with
openness and understanding, if nor
opposition and uproar.

And by “know limits", I mean in»
tellrgcnce and a knack for social jus-
tice. Duh.
