PC troubles con nue

1n die past week. sturienrs have been having
trouble connecting to the lnterner. The problems
are eaused by conncciing new personal eompurers
(PCs) to Resner, whieh students use to eonneer to
the Internet,

in August more than 900 smdenrnowncd PCs
were eonneered to kesner. Eaeh time a eompurer
is eonneerad to Resner more is a ehanee that it will
spread a eompurer worm or virus to other com»
purers on Resnet. Computer patches and anti—vi.
rus software can proteet PCs from most worms
and viruses, bur aeeording to Bill Franeis, the die
reeror oilniormarion Technology Serviees (ITS).
“The vast majority orrhese PC’s were not patehed
against worms released in August on the 1nrerner."
This means that many of the pcs on Resner were
vulnerable ro inreetion, “Infected PCs on Rcsncr
are elogging Resner wim trams, whieh eauses (one
neetion dimeuluos," said 1=raneis

ITS staifand HelpDesk workers have been as
sisting students in proreering rherr pcs They have
also been eontaeting students wnh lnfccmd PCs
and informing them that they need to bring them
to the HelpDesk to have rhem eleaned.

Francis eneourages anyone with a PC that is
not yer eonneered to Resnet ro eontaet ITS before
doing so. This will allow ITS to make sure the PC
is proreered belere ir has the opportunity to eause
any problems

otherwise, Franets said, “For rhe good orrlte
community, after multiple attempts to eommnni.
eatewirh smdenn using inreered PCs, we will evene
tnally bloek me porr eonneering any mirered Pc
to Rcsncl."1fn studenr has their port bloekrd rhey
