Davis Buddy gives wisdom ,

This semester I return to Grinr

nell fiom a summer- and semester off
campus. 1 thought 1 would write this
column with my fresh insight into the
real world and thus the way college
really is.
' lhave noticed some things. Err
press is in thc Fer
illniil think that is
convenient. There
are many new first
year faces to sec day
in and day out. My
English class is full
of friendly, familiar
faces.

And all of the
people in Harris
look familiar, when Harris is dark,
and you are drunk, and looking is
mostly feeling, In short,I came back
to school jaded and ready to lrve the
passage from innocence to aperiencc,
and also to write a column about it,

One thing I thought it would be
okay to look forward to was a reunion
with my Davis Buddy, who is now in
4th grade. After catching up on boys,
we had to talk about school, It came

up that l didn't actually have class
most ofthat day, which is hard to ex-
plain to a nine year old sitting in the
elementary school cafeteria,

I told her, “College is kind of like
having recess all the time." “Weird!”
she answered, “that is wicked cooll”

I would not mis-
ejuotc rny Davis
Buddy,

Especially be
cause I think she
is tight. Although
by their third year,
. most college snrr
dents do consider themselves wicked
cool,l personally never thought ofmy
undergraduate experience as weird.

Boring, stupid, hopeless, tcr
dious, expensive, exhaustingil have
thought these things. Also exciting,
great, meaningful, and fun, of course.
But it’s true, and weird: collcgc is a
playground

motif to scholastic disciplines, social
hierarchy and High Street.

On the play-

learn how to play, plus how to gang

Doesn't that sound kind of like social

that are wrong, or did not attend a

small, intensive liberal arts college in

lowa. My Davis Buddy thinks that

I am weird, and maybe the fresh

comparing notes on corporate
imperialism,

I'm surprised that I still

have my heating at all. I'm

surprised can still 'tiiemr

I do.

\ Then again, I
still have a year
of learning left
to go. A Junior

English major

might say that
although recess does not last forever,
we will always carry that time within
the schoolhouse of our hearts. Or, to
quote poetry and not my Davis Buddy,
“to see heaven in a wild rose/ and the
world in a grain orplayground sand.”

Learning lessons from life in Spain

"Cuchillo" is knife, “Cuchara"is spoon. “Cuello"is
neck. “Culo” is butt.

This is what I learned today, not in school, but af-
ter school. Manuel, a waiter at an Italian {CSmU*
rant, taught me. I taught him to say, “How’s it
goi.rg.>"bccause he doesn’t like to say,“What’s
up?" We were both very proud of ourselves.

Ibet Richard Bright is laughing; his ploy
has succeeded yet again. Every year, he
takes some 250 typical Gtinncllian jut
niorsifull of their literary cultivation,
postmodern worldview, and social con-
sciotisness: a bunch of kids eager to
prove their intelligence, individuality
and ability to rcgurgitatc Socratesi

Suddenly “Everything you c

ever need to know you learn in EVA CONSTANTARAS
English and Spanish. Since most

kindergarten" is the motto for

American students have taken for»

basic survival. And in our rush

to be well~edticared couege kids,

we somehow slapped that critical eign langiagcs as an afterthought and heard “redo cl
mnndohn American English for the last 20 years, the
clamor orArnerican voices has drowned out the pos—

to the bar.

In Grinncll the disjoint is obvious; most inter

national students coming to Grinnell from non-

English speaking countries speak English better

than most of us will speak a foreign language

when we lcavc, even if we are foreignrlant

guage majors. American students in Madrid

ask me why an English

major wants to study

the waiter would have had brought me a knife anyr
way."l’rn much more likely to say that ignorance is a
pain in the neck or a pain in the ass, since now I know
how to say that, but of course I'm sure that doesn’t
translate directly and I’ll have to wait until the next
time I go out to inquire about idioms.

But not cvcrywaiter is as friendly to groups ofselfr
absorbed Americans fumbling loudly in Spanglish.
Generally, their responses involve
muted condescensioa, indulgence,
confusion and patience. Spaniards
are a pretty noisy hunch of people.
but as a whole they seem bafﬂed
by Ametreans’ expectation that in
a foreign environment, the native
group should be understanding
and accommodating to American
linguistic ineptitude,

In my evpcrrence, Spanish
noisincss typically mvolvcs everyone trying to corn
vcv their opinion about a given subject at the same
time, usually about a topre that most everyone can
partr~' to in. Where American nolslness in Spain
consists of cach pe on lying to talk about himself

This term can refer to anyone, from the people in
