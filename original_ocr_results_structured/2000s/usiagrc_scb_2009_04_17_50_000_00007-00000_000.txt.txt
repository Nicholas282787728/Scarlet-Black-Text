Doubt
(2 008)

Excellent actin drives an ex—
hausting but fu filling film

John Patrick Shanley's “Doubt"—hased on
his Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award winning
play—is a series of battles, tvirh the feature
bout between Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Meryl
Srreepl and Father Flynn (Philip Seymour
Hoffman).

It's 1964 in the Bronx, and Father Flynn is
the new guy in town, armed with a fresh may of
interacting with students. He has a laid back
demeanor, and is conversational and friendly
with the kids at St, Nicolas Church School.

This is work based on theatre, so of course
his character is the polar opposite of the rigid,
traditional, unsmrling Sister Aloysius. They
exist in an uncomfortable balanceishc's the
school principal, he’s the parish priest. Streep,
the greatest actor of our generation, and Hoff-
man, an actor of enormous depth and honesty,
crackle in their scenes together. We know
there's a storm coming.

One o‘f the best things about “Doubt" is
the way it plays the audience. We don't know
what to think when the freshtfaced Sister
James (Amy Adams) tells Sister Aloysius that
she thinks something improper may have hape
pened between Father Flynn and the vulnera-
ble and friendless Donald Miller, the first ever
AfricantAmerican student at the school. 515’
ter James is ﬁghting with herselHust as we
areiwhen she confesses het suspicions. She
nails the difﬁcult role of the audience’s moral
compass. Has she done the right thing? We
can’t be so sure. We have doubt.

You can't take your eyes off of Meryl
Sttccp, whose-character takes no time at all to
make her mind up that something awful has
happened. Her face is stone as is her will. l'ler
selfebelief secms unshakeabl:7but watch her
eyes. They dart about, trying to ferret out the
truth. Does she really think that Father Flynn
is guilty, or is her personal dislike for the mart
obscuring his innocence? It's difficult to like
her at fitst, but we slowly come to see that she
is a weary seeker of justice, and so we can at
least respect her,

Hoffman’s Father Flynn is effective here
because he plays him warm and likeable. He
doesn't see himself as a predator, so how can
we? When he is confronted by Sister Aloyt
sius with Sister James present, his reaction to
the accusation is disgust, anger, and, most ef-
fective, a great sadness. He says what we all
know: that even a whisper of such an allegae
lion would kill his cartoon

“1 can fight you," he says resolutely to
which Sister Aloysius quickly rejoins, “And
you Will losc." “Where is your compassion?" he
asks. “Not where you can get at it,"she replies.

The battle lines are drawn when Sister
Aloysius summons Mrs. Miller (Viola Da-
vis) for a chat. All hail Viola Davis. In the
best scene from any mOVIe I've seen all year,
she gives us a ﬁercely maternal but deeply
wounded and conﬂicted woman who is strug-
gling to love and protect her son in the best

Davis was robbed at this year's Academy
Awards. She deserved to wininot just roe

heart and soul of an already emotionally en-
gaging and extremely intelligent ﬁlm.

Shanlcy gives us no easy answers in
“Doubt." 1 found my loyalties shifting long
aftcr the movie had ended. There's an n\‘\l*
ﬁll lot to digest here, and while the film can
be cxhaustingly intense, it is also wonderful,
ﬁlled with sharp writing and powerful pelfors
manees that achieves a relevance and urgency
that most films lack. 1 found myself shaking
both during and after “Doubt." It’s a powerful
experience.

into the sights and sounds ofcincma, and blow
them up until they stretch across the Harris
projection screen, and then deal with it for two
hours.

That's what it’s like to experience \vriter/
director Charlie Kaufman’s “Synecdoche, New
York."I highly recommend it.

The importance of the plot is debatable,
but here goes: successful playwright Caden
(Philip Seymour Hoffman) thinks he’s dying.
which he is. His body becomes a shrine to this
tear, habitually manifesting his neuroses in
gross expulsions of various bodily ﬂuids (lots
of ﬂuids in this one). His wife and daughter
leave him, but at the brink of despair, he res
ccives a MacArthur Genius Grant and decides
to make a play about his life. Predictably, he
hurtles right over a brink, and the rest of the
film plunges almost gleefully into the most
unnervmg ofmetaphysieal quandaries.

Narrative becomes irrelevant in light of
self-reflexive ruminations on a myriad ofsyn»
ecdochCSVparts that stand for the whole.The
film abounds with them. the giant sct Caden
builds inside a warehouse is synccdochical for
New York City, the parts he casts are synec-
dochical for the real people in Caden's life, his
relationships With the actors are synccdochical
for his relationships with the people they play.
Simultaneously, the ﬁlm itselt is synecdochieal
for life—“a fraction ofa fraction ofa moment,"
an event you erroneously think you control,
a spectacle for you and others to observe but
never truly understand.

In order to grapple with all of these con-
voluted parts and elusive wholes, all sense of
time is lost as Caden catapults back and forth

along a muddled temporal trajectory, leaving
us with innumerable questions. What if the
voice mail message on your cell phone today
outlives you 40 years later? What would it be
like to perpetually experience the event ofyour
house burning down, never arriving at the root
ment when it is burned down?

Caden’s futile search for a static selfhood
mirrors the title he momentarily Considers for
his play: “Srrnulacrum,” or postmodernist Jean
Baudrillard's theoretical concept that there is
no real, no core kernel ofseLf, no spoon—only
copies ofcopies.

Why such a nauseating waltz withuhe
most troubling of questions about life, death
and art? Because Charlie Kaufman, the screens
writer who brought you such brain-skewering
rate as “Being John Malkovich," “Adaptation,”
and “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."
has finally taken his first spin in the director's
chair, and he wants to share his deep dark
thoughts.

Kaufman's style does make the movw int
credibly sclfrindulgent, though, and only be-
comes increasingly more noticeable the more
Caden spirals into the bile ducts ofdeath. At
least it also admits to its selftdeprecating m,
velegazing.

We might get some explanation from this
little Kaufman gem that he recently lamented
during an interview with “Wired:” “Then: res
ally is only one ending to any story Human liie
ends in death. Until then, it keeps going and
gets complicated and there’s loss. Everything
involves loss; every relationship ends in one
way or another."
