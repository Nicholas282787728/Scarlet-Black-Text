The Chicago Cubs: love ’em, loathe ’em

thol-INNV Buss

Anyone with the slightest knowledge of
Major League Baseball's most "lovable losers"
can tell that the Cubs own Grinncll. As the
Cubs experienced a short-lived playoff run
early frrsr scmcstcr and approached their sea-
son opener a few days ago, I began to notice
the domination] of red C: and bright blue t-
shirts. Certainly, the amount of Kerry Wood
jerseys on campus outnumber those of any
other player by leaps and bounds, if not all of
them combined.

I have been subject to countless blind exV
pectations that I, too, am a fellow fan when I
have asked a Cubs~clad Grinnelljan or townie
about last night’s score or tomorrow’s starter.
Later, I’m subjected to condescending apolm
gies or outright jeers after my true identity
is revealed, But I am okay with it. I am okay
with the mindless masses of Chicagoans and
bandwagoners, the Cubsenormative baseball
subculture, the insults hurled at mi: harder
than a Wood fastball. I soldier on and take
the ﬁre in stride, because I bleed Cardinals
red.

Within inc exist memories [1].“ are un-
known to every cubs fan. These are the sighrs
and sounds ofn World series Championship,
of winning in its purcsr American essence.
Ofcourse, 1 have hid tears ofsadncss, as any
sports fan has, in smashed homers and blown
saves, times of despair
and finality. But I have
also shed tears of joy
that needed no hope of
another win, tears that
came at the end of it
all, in the face ofa glor
rious, massive. heaving
sea ofred and ﬁreworks
and beer and baseball. I have tasted ecstasy,
swaying in a drunken circle singing Q1561) as
postegame shouts of joy blared from the TV
behind me and my friends beside me. Tears
that I need not be ashamed of.

My hopes and dreams of17 years have
been fulﬁlled, and all the jeering in the world,
all the Cubs fans in Grinnell, can’t take away
that cool ocrober night.

Growing up,1 didn't have much to do

during the summers; my family wasn’t keen on
imcations and I did not stray too fatiutlier than
to go to the neighborhood park to play Little
League baseball. Otherwise,I would read books
and watch
'whatever was
on the TV in
the afternoon.

_ you don'r have

‘ - ' r ‘ cable, means
only one thing

in Chicago: a

At first, I only watched to keep myself en—
tertained during those long summer days, but
soon it became much more than that. When
September rolled around and it was time for me
to start the third grade, all I could think about
was rushing home to hopefully catch the last
few innings ofa game.I was eight years old and
the Cubs had already transcended the label of
just a baseball team.

April I], 2008

Despite the fact that the Cubs were so dear
to me, my father despised American sports and
had yet to take inc to a game at the Friendly
Confines. After begging and begging him, he
ﬁnally caved in and took me on a fateful August
evening. Kerry Wood was pitching, the wind
was blowing out, and the woeful Cincinnati
Reds were in (own; the stage was ser for a magie
cal nighr.1n (he fourrh inning, Kerry Wood was
up to our. and rhe Reds had just scored the pre
vious inning and taken the lead. But then I saw
it, a home run to rhc Wrigley bleachers.

Five innings and a couple of hot dogs larer,
1 was the happiest boy in the world taking rhe
train back home. As I sat next to a total stranger
on the train, I realized it was no stranger at all,
but rather another faithﬁil Cubs fan. I told him
how this was my first Cubs game and without
hesitation, he reached into his pocket and gave
me a batting practice ball with a blue C on it.

Since that night I have witnessed the highs
and lows.I have witnessed blown saves and walk
off home runs. Yet everyday] pray to witness
the Cubs win the World Series. So until that
fateful day, next year is here.

Stop complaining about the S&B and do something about it.
