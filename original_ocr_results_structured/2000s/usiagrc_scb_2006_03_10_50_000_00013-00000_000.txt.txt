Finding a prize at local flea market

Saturday morning, 7:50 am, Grinnell Vere
eran's Building: The ﬁrst vendors arrive to set
up shop, straining to hide their irritation when
they find me camped outside the darkened
building. Their ruinous efforts have been in
vain. I am here.

by ﬂashy adver-
tisements for the
Brooklyn Fire
Department Fish
Fry and upcoming
PAW cat show, the
Penny Saver's ant
nouncement of the monthly ﬂea market was
suspiciously small, perhaps in a failed attempt
to conceal it from my unfailingly thrifty con-
sumerist gaze. And yet I can not he escaped.

Slowly they unpack their hoards 7 Used
door hinges (4 for so), giant lockets featuring
scenes ot 17th century peasant debauchery,
towels sewn in the shape of an elegant dress,
half of a best friend necklace (poignantly
reading just i-st —end’), every Menudo record
ever made (84 for the set) 7 I scour the room,

searching for my prize. And theii,,.,then....

I see her. Yes, of course she is here, his
sutiablc in their rudimentary sabotage, the
panicked vendors have no doubt called for
reinforcement. My whole body tenses M the
presence of these two feminine aging bodies
morphed into one
formidable oppo—
rient.

The unsuspectt
ing crowd sees only
Vl‘vlcnl'm and Bev—
erly: Hardee’s unde-
feated Wednesday
morning Bingo champs. Only I who know
the true nature of... Viverly.

suddenly I see what they are protecting
so desperately Ibound across the room, just
missing the 5100 lifersized palm tree lamp.

Viverly stands innocently over the comet
table, feigning bewildered amusement at the
priceless artifact that lies before her, It is a
find most ﬂea market enthusiasts can only
dream of: the lower iight mandible ofa spire
rm Caﬂat, the elusive African cape Buffalo.

“Well now isn't that funny? What is that,
a cow bone?" Coy and composed, Viverly slyly
plays the fool.

“Found that in the back yard. Couldn’t
really say where it's from. I thought maybe
some kid'd want it or something.” The vendor
responds with equal deception.
Slowly I realize he’s iii on it too.
"I’ll probably just end up givin
it away."

Ah ha, a new tactic. Know
ing she would inevitably fail in
a corporeal melee, Viverly now
seeks to defeat me through psychological mac
nipulation.

Her not-so-witty banter can only be a
misguided attempt to convince me of the
mandible's worthlessness, thus discouraging
my acquisition of this rare artifact. Oh vi-
verly, how sorely you unmisunderestimate me.

As Viverly feigns interest in the cubic-
zitconia studded ash tray at the next table, 1

proach the conspiratorial vendor:

“so here’s how it's going to be. I'm going

me

to give you this,"I slip a crisp 20 across the
table, “and you are going to give me what I
want.” Placing my diminutive body between
Viverly and her precious “cow bone,"I gesture
discreetly toward the mandible.

“This thing? You sure you wouldnt rather
have one ofthese — ”

“Look buddy, I don't need
any of your games. Now do we
have a deal or not?" Silence. “So
that's how it’s gonna be, is it?
Alright, I'll go to 40, but that's
it, you understand?"

It is useless to resist. Slowly he hands over
the mandible, trying to conceal a desperate
glance over to Viverly.

Victorious, I walk to the door with my
prize held high: undisputed proofof the Afrit
can Cape Buffalo’s presence in North Ameriea,
a reality that until now existed only in legend.
I steal a glance back at Viverly.

She smiles and waves, as if to mock me.
But we both know I’ve won today’s battle.
Until next time Viverly, until next time.

Within the last three weeks, Grinnell College students have
been overwhelmed with information about the new Recycle~
Mania Program that we have been enrolled in. We have received
emails and read articles all about how Gtinnell doesn’t recycle
enough. One cannot even use the restroom without being ,3,
minded about recycling. Have you ever see
riously considered where the 3 R‘s (Reduce,
Reuse, and Recycle) came from and why
they are so important that we teach them
to children in elementary school?

Here's the skinny from John Tierney's
I996 New York Times article that helps
explain the recycling craze of our genera
tion. In the spring of1987, there was a gar—
bage barge named the Mobra. The ship was
exporting 3200 tons of New York's trash to other regions of the
country The owners of the private disposal company, hired by
local government, were trying to ﬁnd the cheapest landfill to
dump the garbage to maximize their profits.

They initially had a deal in Louisiana, but found a more
proﬁtable location ‘in North Carolina. Unfortunately, the ship
landed in North Carolina before they could finalize the paper
work; their early arrival caused the North Carolina site to worry
about what was in the garbage. So, the folks in North Carolina
decided to back out of the deal. In addition, they forwarded
information about the hurried delivery to the original dump
location in Louisiana.

Once the other site heard about what was happening, they
too pulled out because they thought there was something il-
legal in the garbage. As a result, the Moors traveled two months
and 6,000 miles looking for a home for the garbagei All this

We are not running out of natural
resources! Here is the paradox:

we are using more reiourres, but
those same resource; are becoming
available as technology enhances.

time, the media hyped that there was a nationwide landfill
shortage because the Main; supposedly couldn't find a site. In
Response, the Environmental Protection Agency created the
3 R‘s to solve a non-existent problem with recycling as the es-
sential component.

The media hype surrounding the Mar
ho was undue and there is not, nor ever
was, a landfill shortage. More safe, modern
landfills are opening all the time and their
carrying capacity has actually increased the
amount of space available for trash. HOWT
ever, the total number oflandﬁlls is decreas-
ing nationally because older landfills cannot
meet the strict regulations imposed by the
EPA.

As stated by Daniel Benjamin in his essay Eigrir Gizn/
Myth: afRer cling, “The EPA itself acknowledges that the risks
to humans and presumably plants and animals) from modern
landst are virtually nonexistent." The garbage industry has
become a :54 billionrpertyear business that is centered on inter-
state trade. So in many ways,having New York ship its garbage
out ofstate is good for the national economy.

Now I am sure you are thinking, “Mir, I [bong/1r Mir article
aiar about recycling?" Well, it still is. One of Benjamin's myths
is that “We squander irreplaceable resources when we don’t rec
cycle." This is totally false! We are not running out of natural
resourcesl Here is the paradox: we are using more resources but
those same resources are becoming more available as technol—
ogy enhances. Let’s take trees for example.

Despite the amount of logging that occurs in the temperate
forests ofNorth America, Europe and Russia, over the past 40

Knowing where your food

one hundred years ago life on the plains was tough; we cer-
tainly have it a whole lot easier today. In the past however, the
landscape and technology forced people to rely on community
and the food raised locally by friends and neighbors.

Even though we no longer need to live in such a way, many
ofthe values such a food system engendered are still important.
The rise of a fasttpaced economy and interstate commerce have
fragmented the rural landscape and monopolized how we get
out food.

Such a system poses grave risks such as food shortages if
transportation is disrupted, as well as a loss in taste and quality
of what we eat.The solution to this problem lies right outside
on the land ifwe return to a community-based economy and a
revival of the local food system.

if you’re not from Iowa, there’s a good chance you had
heard about it only as an agricultural state. But as you might
have learned traveling down [-80, most of the farm land here is
devoted not to human food crops, but rather to industrialized
monoculture.

The bulk of the land is used to grow feed for cattle, hogs
and chickens that are then shipped to animal confinemeuts
across the country This is part ofa trend that began 50 or so
years ago.

This trend destroyed the small family farm as the backbone
of rural communities as well as resulted
in the devastating loss of genetic diversity
among agricultural crops.

This type of agriculture produced a
huge corporate industry that controls
nearly every level of food production and
distribution.

This mealls that most of the food we
eat every day in lowa comes from outside orowa— and most
likely it has traveled over 1500 miles to get here. This tact has
a big impact on all ot’our lives.

This semester John Andclson of Prairie Studies and Eli
Zigas ’06, us well as nine other motivated and committed stil-
dents, have organized an independent study to assess how the

Busting Grinnell’s myth Of recycling

years these forests have expanded. Even more, the average price
of most raw materials has decreased by roughly 80 percent since
1845, according to Benjamin, after adjusting for inﬂation.

Recycling is a business and it needs to be seen as such. Like
all businesses, it has its environmental issues. Do you realize
that the process of recycling materials can create more toxins
than ifwe simple threw garbage away in to safe modern landr
fills?

Think about it: for every garbage truck there is also a re-
cycling truck. And the recycling truck uses the same “non»
renewable” resources as the garbage truck including, iron ore,
coal, steel, rubber, and petroleum; all of which then double the
amount of air pollution that would otherwise have been cre—
ated by a single garbage truckThe City ofDes Moines, whose
residents pay over 51 million every year to recycle, switched to a
once-a-month collection of recyclables a year ago and has since
saved over $250,000 in transportation and labor costs. Without
government subsidies and accounting tricks recycling would be
more expensive than throwing everything away!

The 3 R‘s have been forced into the American subconscious,
so that people today ‘feel good’when they recycle, and yet pushy
recycling programs like Recyclchania only serve to make so-
ciety worse off.

Who wants to mste time and separate out trash into seven
categories? Not mel Recycling costs too much (in time and
money) and no matter what can be gained (if anything) from
recycling, it is still too expensive. What this school needs is a
reduction in the amount of recycling. And in the future, if tech
nology still hasn't progressed to make recycling more economic
cally efficient, then we should stop recycling entirelyl
