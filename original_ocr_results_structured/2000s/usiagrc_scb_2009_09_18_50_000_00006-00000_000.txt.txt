Many Grinnell college students with a shared passion for
art and relaxation may not realize that these two interests can
now be combined with yoga classes in the Faulconer Gallery

Taught by instructor Jenn Mavin at 12:15 pm. every
Thursday, these classes not only provide a way to center one—
selfin the midst of a busy day, but also allow students, faculty
and community alike to enjoy the cthibits that Faulconer ot-
fers.

“I think sometimes people will say, ‘Whar does yoga have
to do with art?’ but I love the way the breathing and the see»
ing work together," the Curator ofAcademic and Community
Outreach at Faulconer, Tilly Woodward said. “I think somer
times people spend more time looking at the artwork when
they’re doing yoga than they would while just casually walk—
ing through the gallery."

The impetus behind the more regularly scheduled yoga-
in-the-gallery program is the recent partnership between the

Wellness Commrttec and Faulcouer. Not only does yoga in the
gallery provide a unique venue for classes but it is also the only
time each week that yoga classes are offered south of 3th Av-
enue, providing those with a limited amount of time the op-
portunity to attend a class.

Erica SeltzerrSchultz ’12 and Lauren Flynn both '12, the
leaders of Yoga Club this year, are both excited about the in-
creased number ofclasses in the gallery

“it’s a really cool way ofblcnding an art form with physical
movement," SeltzertSchultz said.

The blend is so thorough that the class will modify to ac-
commodate the space, “The instructor often changes the class
to revolve around the art," Flynn said.

Currently, Faulconer Gallery is changing exhibits. The new
exhibit, entitled Molecules that Matter, interprets tcn molecules
discovered in the past century through both the scientiﬁc and
visual arts, as well as through the social sciences.

“I think the new exhibit will be wonderful with the yoga
program,"Woodward said. "It’s interesting to contemplate how
very small things have very large impacts. Breathing is a very
small activity, but it’s a very vital activity. 1 think that same met-
aphor can be applied to the molecules themselves.”

Although this new exhibit is larger than many that the gal-
lery shows, space is reserved for the yoga classes. Lesley Wright,
the gallery director, emphasized that the beneﬁts of yoga in the
gallery go both ways.

"It gives us a way to attract people who might not be as
regnrlar at viewing art," Wright said. “Ifwe can get them con-iv
fortablc that this is a space for them, whichever way they ﬁrst
start to come here, then we feel like they’re more likely to take
a chance and come to other programs."

This is exactly what happened to Ellyn Ochs '13, who at'
tended the yoga class in Faulconer during Nso week. “IfI
think the exhibit is interesting while rm doing yoga, 1 would
be more likely to come back and check it out later," Ochs said.

Overall, the yogarin hergallery program has been well re:
ceived.Whilc the classes in the gallery had previously consisted
mostly of staff, with a more consistent schedule this year, in—
creasing numbers ofstudents have attended each week. Woodr
ward and Wright also expect the new exhibit to generate intcrt

Breaking Away, doesn’t

BY COLIN CARR

Peter Yates Breaking Away may spin
a familiar comingrofrage yarn, but does
so with dedication and sincerity that ulr
timately wins us over. It tells the story of
four teenage boys who just graduated high
school in a blue collar Indiana town strugr
gling to frgure out what to do next.

If this sounds like a familiar premise
allow me to assure you that the familiar
tics don't stop thereThe stat of the clique
rs a sunny and handsome renegade named
Dave (Dennis Christopher) H: has one
passionibicyclc racingiirn obsession
complemented by a love for Italian culture,
He doesn't understand how to commit to
anythingolhcr than the thrill ofthc rrrcci
bad luck that his disapproving corrservrltr
dad (Paul Dooley) nags hrs son crrtllctsly
and occasionally laments hrs existence.

As the comingrofrage genre convent
tions in play already indicate, the rest of
the movrc will consist in Dave proving
himself as a true athlete and finally wine
nrng rhc approval of his dad.

Despite the story’s refusal to bike
off the trodden path, director Yates and
screenwriter Steven Tesich infuse the ﬁlm
With some winning idiosyncrasies, Dave’s
unabashed Itirlophilia works in hilarious
contrast to the alermcrican fervor of his
provincial hometown, Covering his walls
with Italian posters and blasting Enrico
Morticone from his bedroom, Dave drives
his father so crazy that he refuses on prinr
ciple to have any Italian food at the dinner
table.

A more dramatic element that separ
rates Breaking Away from [he comingrofr
age flock comes via setting the story in a
college town. This forces the four work
ing class teenage denizensto think about
their own prospects in comparison with
the more upwardly mobile careers that the
local college students seem to be leading.

It's not an unheard of dynamic in a come ‘

ingrofrage filmiGoodwill Hunting comes
to mindibul Yates focuses on it With pent
etrating seriousness.

Addrtionally, a remarkable performance
by a young Dennis Quid cnlwens this cont
ﬂict. Quaid plays Mike, the toughest and
gruffest of the four teens. In a poignant
scene at a college ball game, hc discusses
the agony of reading about the athletic ac~

, eomplishmeuts of the college kids in the

town paper. lie knows that he’ll grow old in
his hometown and that the college athletes
will stay young. A new batch will come ev-
ety year and he’ll stay on the sidclincs, still
reading about them in the papcu Quid
avoids playing the scene for easy pathos.
IIc instead remriins severe and restrained,
letting the drama stem from his pensive,
lcvcl gaze

Likc Matthew Broderick in his Foi-
ris Bueller heyday, Christopher-a natural
chunu allows him to litrm up his pcrfor~
mance without annoying us. He can play
zdiiy and vulnerable, cocky and gawky and
sometirues all or these things at once. IIis
versatility allows him to stay true to the
contradictions inherent in adolescent bee
havior and carries the ﬁlm through its
highs and lows.

complimenting Christopher’s perforr
mance eloquently is Peter Yate’s directorial
restraint. Yates avoids wrenching up the
tension ofthe material with schmaltzy mo'
tivation music or emphatic closerups. He
keeps his camera steady and avoids unnecr
essary editrng. He has enough confrdence
in the young actors’ performances to give
them room to breathe and this conﬁdence
proves warranted.

Breaking Away isn't a great frlm. Much
of the screenplay lacks inspiration. But it
is carried out without conﬁdence and care
and is secure enough in its emotional depth
to avoid heavyrhandedness.

est. “In general, there’s just a lot of enthusiasm,"Wright said.

on Sept. 4, the Giiiincll community Art Center opened r tuo shorv exhibition

with works bi Sara Peak Convcrv and Driitiri Stepiinek. Located on the second ﬂoor

oftlic Grinnell Communit) Center, on Park Street between 4th and 5th rventtcs, the
Griiincll Community Art Gallery is a faith small, but nonetheless l1\’l(l"g space.

The current exhibition features two collections of vcrv tr ting work Peak
convcrys picces mostly consist of highly colortul, energetic oil p intings ofwedding
scenes. The celebration depictions are beautifully crilfted, with layers of oil paint
swirling and mixing, lending a feeling of dance to the worksia testament to the
human spirit. Mixed in with dynamic works are a few etchings and engraves that,
while smaller in scale and seemingly serious in comparison, are nonetheless striking.

By contrast, Stepanek’s work consists of photographs thar she rook while in
Prague. These six photographs were digitally manipulated, adding the appearance
of rainbows to what would otherwise be dire subject martcrisccncs of a jcwish
Cemetery, a torture museum, and an abandoned coalminc. The most striking work, a
close-up photograph ofa gas mask with a rainbow covering one of rhe eyes, offers a
glimmer afhope and happiness in an otherwise ominous setting.

Staffed by rotating volunteers, many of which are from the Mayflower Retire-
ment Home, and sponsored by Wells Fargo Bank, the exhibition of32 total works,
all ofwhich can be purchased, will be open and on display until Sept. 24.

The Grinneli Community Art Gallery is open Monday through Friday from 3
pm. to 5:30 pm, or otherwise by appointment. Information about upcoming exhibi-
tions can be found at wwwgrinnellartsorg/gallery.
