Life and death, truths and charades

Harold and Maude

Classic film deliv-
ers staged suicides,
cleaned-up hearses
and warm fuzzies

You'll be 1ch with a warm and
fuzzy feeling after watching Hive/r1
anlemidt', a classic "let go and love
life" film from 1971. The Titettlnyr
”lull/I Moi r fresque plot, combined with

‘ quirky tidbits it In Garden Store tar/rive-
ltr, destine the film to rarikamong your
favorites. (Unless, of course, your {a
vorrte film is Dit’ Hard in which case
this movie isn’t for you.)

It’s easy to giow a stlangc attachr
ment to the scrawny, pile and death-
obsesscd character, 20-year-old Harold,
who manages to steal your heart while
staging cvcry suicide in the book to rile
up his hoightyaoighty mother-

His world is jolted when he meets
Maude, a vivacious woman appi‘oachr
ing 80, who, like Harold, enjoys ate
tending the funerals of strangers The

whirlwrnd begins as Maude casuallv.

steals Harolds car, which is, I kid you
not, a cleaned- -up hearse.

The all-but-subtle theme of death
trails their wacky udventuies and their
search tor heaury in everyday lite, de-
picted by Maude's classic quote, “A lot
of people enjoy being dead.

But they are not dead, really.Thcy’rc
just backing away from lite. Reach out.
Take a chance. Get hurt evcnr But play
as well as you can, Go (cam, go!"

Maude’s afﬁnity for the world
around her, coupled with a soundtrack
by Cat Stevens, transforms what would
be a movie with a perverse sense orhue
mor into a lovable tale,

Harald arr/I Maude has been gloiir
fred over the years for its cinematic
brilliance, Many shots are taken from
unexpected, yet clever angles that can
sometimes be alaimingifoi instance,
a subtle crotch shot as Harold's chair
is slung backwards during one of his
many suicide attempts.

Things to notice? Besides the ri-

diculous harrtlos, look out for symmcr
try in scenes, like Harold and Mantle
milroling each others’ postriresronce
you see it, you'll soon be ﬁndmg it in
every scene.
so come out and take this opporr
ninrty to sit, relax and enjoy this clearly
progressive ’70s ride ofdatk humoi and
the will to live.

The story behind coat/rebinvolvr

Grant, iicvcr better.

By sheer power of their chemistry
and charisma, these two legendary stars
could make even the most mediocre
movie agreeable.

In Cbnma’r, though, they are magr

a terrific cast, which includes Walter

Despite a few yawns,

Al Gore’s film delivers
powerful warning and
tangible suggestions

Are you one oi‘the cynics who think
that global warming might just be a
little oveiexagetmted? This movie is
hound to give your stubborn mindset a
massive revamp.

Former us. Vice President Al
Gore, in a quasi-presentation, quasi-
documentary style, serves as the nar-
rator, detailing the Earth's impending

wocs in pictures, graphs and humor

He takes viewers on ajourney across
the seven continents, and with anima-
tions and startling graphs, predicts the
arrival of doomsday and many more
Katrinas in our lifetime.

The movie paints a horriﬁc picture
ofhow Earth might end up irwe don't
start recycling and saving energy,

Gore also shares important events
from his own lire which, surprisingly,
help give strength to his story.

He talks ofthe death ofhis beloved
sistei to cancer, the near loss of his son
to a car accident and the disappoint-
ments of the 2000 elections.

Although the documentary style
element or the movie does bring in a
rcw yawns every now and then, Gore
succeeds in delivering a powerhrl mes-
sage and providing tangible actions the
viewers can take

Ahnost motivational, he appeals to
the audience's emotions and shows his
conviction that an end to Earth's looms
ing catastrophe is a realizable goal

This is Gore reinvigorated with a
poweiful message since the 2000 eletr
(ions.

True, the man has gained a few
pounds, but he seems to have finally
left the election defeats behind him
