V On May 9, 1754, the hrst political cartoon to be pub—

lished in America appeared in the Pennsylvania Gazette.
It depicted a snake, chopped into eight pieces, labeled
with the caption "JOIN, or DIE." Accompanying the graphic was an editonal
by Benjamin Franklin commenting on "the present disunited state of the
Bntish Colonies."

Unlike many reptiles, a snake can't detach its tail when a predator grabs it.
The ability is called autotomy, and appears in salamanders, most lizards,
and even a few rodents, As a lizards tail develops, each vertebra includes a
weak spot which can snap under heavy pressure. In most cases the tail can
grow back, although it's never quite what it once wast And because the tail
is usually an important storage space for tat, the lizard may have trouble
surviin'ng the winter.

Regeneration of body parts is quite common among invertebrates, No, you
can’t make two earthworms by cutting an earthworm in halfiearthwovms
are too sophlsﬁcated~but you can make lots and lots of ﬂatworms by
cutting some ﬂatworms into lots and lots of little pieces, If you cut a
ﬂatworm's head in two or three, you can make a two or threecheaded
flatworm.

In one famous expen'merit, flatworms were placed on a v.shaped path and
taught to turn in a particular direction when they came to the fork. The
worms were then chopped up and fed to other ﬂatworms—and the second
set of ﬂatworms learned more quickly which direction to turn. scientists
speculate that this might be due to some chemical change ﬂatworms unc
dergo when they learn things: the second set of worms, therefore, vvould
have had a head startin producing that chemical, whatever it was.

Cannibalism, it seems, may not be illegal in the United kingdom. One eigh—
teenth—century naval court case did hold it to be a crime, but in was the
British government said it had no plans to explicitly forbid the practice. It’s
harder to find related u.s. law, but the Iowa Code contains no mention of
cannibalism, either in opposition or in support.

An old Iowa law did forbid kisses from lasting longer than ﬁve minutes,
though. (Don’t fret, It isn't on the books any more.)

According to a recent study, about twice as many couples turn their heads
to the n'ght when they kiss as turn to the left. The tendency doesn’t seem to
correlate to handedness; rather, humans in general tend to choose to use
their right foot, ear or eye on that same 2-to-l ratio.

left-handed Ameﬁtan: are slightly more likely to get into car accidents
than n'glitchanded Americans, because when startled they tend to veer to
the left, into incoming trafﬁc, rather than to the nght, into the curb.

Increased numbers of tratﬂc accidents have always been one of the major
arguments against daylight saving time, when congress called for year
round daylight savings time in 1973, the number of morning school bus
crashes jumped, One study also found an eight percentiump in car crashes
the Monday after daylight sawng goes into effect, presumably because ev-
erybody loses an hour of sleep. The strongest opposition to the system,
however, has always come from farmers, who observe that cows and most
ers don't understand daylight saving time.

The first person to suggest daylight saving time was Benjamin Franklin.

'l‘he rimc has come, Finals arc irporr us and graduation
will soon be at hand Since employment (for some reason)
scems to be an unlikely possibility for me, l've decided to
exploie postgraduarion plans B ihru E, siiic rhcydon'r liavc
the prestige ofatrcnding “graduatc school" or bcing able to
”move our ofyoiir parcnu house," but 1 think they present
a host otivondcrful options tor rhosc who dam to stray from
tho bcarcn path. Let's take a loold

plan B'; Take massive dose otlemalc hormones withrn
72 hours of graduation. Hope to god that graduate status
passes and swear never to make same mistake again, send
thank you card to the ladies at the health center,

Plan C; stay in Grinncll, grow board, can stories bout
the old daysr lryou’vc ever seen a crazy old man wandering
through (own and thought, ”hey. I wish I were him," this
might be just the plan for you, Like in days of yore, you'll
still be able to attend all ofyour lavorrrc college cvcnn: Bob's
open mic nights, campus speakers. house partras, dorm
rooms. The only difference is that no one will ltnoiv who
you are and you'll hc looked upon in drtgust Did 1 mcnc
iion you'll got to attend house parties.)

I’Ian D: Move to Chicago and iehrse to spealt to any
one who didn’t receive a on. from Grinnell. .. cause, like,

rurdiry, and fond memories of pacing on the zirldc. This
plan also affords you Ihc opportunity otlivirrg near Oprah.
plan E: For tear or the unknown, marry another
Grinnellian. Upon leaving Grinnell, many students are
frightened to learn otsomcrhirig called “daring." which single
non-Grinncllians do in rhc “real" world While we might

Opening communication
about mental health

ln liglirofthc r-cceni passing ofa valued member otoiir
community, many questions havc bccii raised about tlic
general mental hcalrh otour campus As a gioiip ofcollcgc
students, stirring to do well in drmcult classes, challenged
by the social scene otri small campus secluded in rural Iowa.
dealing with growing up and lcrwirrg hoiiic rid struggling
to find tridcnibrtcc our individual pcrsonalirr ,ir is all too
easy to. us to ﬁnd oirrsclvcs dcprtsscd and strtsscd out. 1
have personally ('xpcncnccd rhcsc rssiics, hit rock bottom,
and worked to pvt-iconic ihcm as best 1 can. as have many
orhcr people. uniorriinatcly, ihc pasr year has shown that
these problems have become too frequent and too serious.
Conquering mental health problems can be very difﬁcult
when trying to work through the Pouitslrick county Mane
ral Health Center, .i system designed for a and {aiming
community's needs, riotucollcgccirnpus. Furthermore, dirt-
to a general lack of public luiowlcdgc about mcnral hcrilth.
many people Find it difﬁculI to discover sources for mental
care, and rear bcingstrginaritcd tor rhcir problems. lr should

be of grave concern to the community as a ivholc wlicn
society imposes a tear or ﬁnding hclp upon its members
when thcy need it the most. Whether ﬁnding help means
talking to a friend, an SA, an RLC, orseclting professional
assistance or medication, it needs to be as socially accepted
as stopping by rhc health center for cough drops and
ibuprofen. we need to raise varcntss and liridtisranding
ofrhcsc pioblcms, and start tilting about solutions a

crcry.

My proposal: to start communication about mcnral
licilrh Prublcmb on campus, roshoivsolrdaniyand support
for those who have mental health problems, and to raise
awarcncss ofsoluiions arlable for mental health problems,
