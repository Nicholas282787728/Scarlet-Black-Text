Enrering rhe ineering, rhe srrnregy was in rhe “our" earegory otideas
that might go inro rhe rinal srraiegy _ rhe oiliei uvo earegoiies were
“in”and“11111mbo."Chnlr otFaeulry Mark Monigoinery placed rhe
snaregy on ihe “our" list as a resulr otnegarive responses expressed in
focus groups eondueied earlier in die semesrei.

However, by rhe end orrlie meering rhe nusiees vorcd ro rnove
rhe sriaregy io rhe “in" lisr. The vote ineans rlie steering eoinininee
will rurrher consider addressing ideological diversiiy as one pair of
the ﬁnal strategy they will submn ro rhe Board next May.

The sriaregy to “become more ideologieally diverse" was origi.
nally pair ottha “Enhancing Our Connecuon ro Iowa" srraregii pan
ofwhidi miled for a plan io “eveieoine Giiiinells image otbeing too

Some rrusrees said ehey eould nor divoree ideology From a dis»

nomic, in ihe planning process,

Tom Cindy, viee presidenr {or srudenr his, ﬁrst moved io keep
ihe srmiegy on ihe “1n”lixt. He pointed to a parre‘in ol religious
intoleranre on ampus as a reason io tuirhei consider how the sine
dent body/s ideology iniluenees members orrhe communiry, Citing
Mormons as an example ora group for which rhe sehool is a hosrile
environmenr.

GabeRosenberg ’03. however. argued rhar ihe college is perceived
as an intolerant and exclusive place because it roleiares behavior and
ideas thar mueh orsociery rejects.

“l’ni nor sugesung thar we should become a less rolorani place
for any number otrhe minorities we embrace here," Rosenberg said,
"Bur realize ihai when we stake our rhar posirion we are eommiriiug
ourselves in some way to a general discursive eoinmuniry rhar may
be hosrile to some people in our soeiery "

gesred rhar when people call Grinnell college a “lettisr place" rhey
really mean its a “rolenini plaee,” and said she would nor supporr
any move away from rhai pereepriou of rolerance.

As the discussion evolved inro an assessmenr ofthc cuiienr srare

ofideologiaal diversity on campus, Chair ofthe Faculty, Mark Monr- ’

gomery inrerveiied “This is abour ihe planning process, us nor abour
the ideology," he said.

“Can you imagine ruining in a doeuinenr rhar says, ‘wc reeoin.
