It was a blustery 33 degrees Fahre
enheit in Mt. Vernon Iowa, as the Pio-
neers prepared to compete in thc Hille
top open on Feb. 4. Erin Sindewald '08
nervously toed the starting line, com-
pletely unable to relax before her one
mile run. At the sound of the starter
pistol she was off, racing among a pack
of other runners wearing nothing but
a spandex uniform, just like everyone
else.

Another season of Pioneer Indoor
Track and Field had orrieially begun.

The first meet {or Grinnell college
was hosted by Cornell College. Nine
Division III schools competed at the
meet. The competition was tough, es-
pecially because Grinnell was not com-
peting with all ofrheir team.

"A lot of guys felt that they weren’t
in a good enough shape so they are go-
ing to hold back and run at a later date,”
said Tommy Jamison '09. “Also some
of the guys are being saved for bigger
meets down the road."

In spire of rho short-handed roster
at the meet, there were several outstands
ing performances in individual events.
Darren McNabb ’07 broke GrinnrJl's
record in the weight rhrow with his toss

ley or, finished second in the mens one
mile with a time offour minutes and 22
seconds. senior Nick Fogg won thc 5k
with a time of 16 minutes flat,

The women's team also gave a very
srrong performance. Anna Gilbert, a
first year, started the season by taking
second place in the pole vault, clearing
an impressive height of nine feet and
6.25 inches.

Liz Ehlinger '09 also scored for
the team with a leap of 30 feet and 1.5
inches, which was good enough for 7th
place. sara brady'o7 and Emily Lynam
’09 showed ﬁnished 6th and 7th res
speetively in the 800 meter run.

Although Sindewald did not score
for the team, she ran her personal best
at the meet for the mile with a time of
five minutes and 40 seconds.

The next meet for the team will be
held in Buena Vista this weekend with
the ultimate goal of placing second
in the Division 111 Conference at the
end of the season. But Grinnell has a
long struggle ahead ofthem in order to
reach that goal.

Despite the slow start to the season,
Head Coach Will Freeman remained
upbeat. “I liked what I saw for the
group. They have a great potential but

right now the focus is on training."

Two tough losses on the road for women’s basketball

suffered two losses this past week as theytook to the
road and battled conference rivals Ripon college and
Beloit College.

The Pioneers are officially out or playorlreonten-

points came by way of the three»

Grinnell as a team shot 13 for 37 from behind the
arc. However, the rest of the Pioneers had some dif-
ficulty generating offense and despite a solid first-half
effort, Grinnell fell 77760.

“We came out strong against Ripon in the first
half, but had trouble keeping things going in the sec-

ring to the bus/tel and gel [0 the
foul line and knock down Shots.”

Giinnell had another difficult task the very next
afternoon, as they drove up to Beloit,Wisc. to take on
the Buccaneers.

Katy Bowen ’06 led the way for the Pioneers, score
ing a game—high 23 points.

Unfortunately, Grinnell once
again had difﬁculty ﬁnding offence
anywhere else.

Beloit had three women score
in double ﬁgures and although
Grinnell forced 15 turnovers, it
was not enough to close on the
Buccaneers. After trailing by nine
points at halftime, the Pioneers
eventually fell to Beloit, 65745.

“Beloit had a really good matchrup zone that
didn’t allow us to ever really get into a rhythm," said
Bowen.“Wc didn't have enough movemenr in our of-
fense to be able to counter their zone and it left us
kind of standing around on the perimeter rather than

attacking the openings."

Grinnell has another challenge in front of them
as they head to Illinois college on Saturday Grinnell
sits in front of 1C in the Midwest Conference stands
ings and this is certainly a winnable game in the eyes
ofboth the players and the coaches.

“We need to go out there expecting their best ef-
fort," said Bowen. “We‘re still ahead of them in the
standings so they'll be gunning for us,We need to be
aggressive getting to the basket and get to the foul
line and knock down shots."

With only three games left on the schedule, every
contest is important in terms of ending the season on
a high note and carrying some momentum into the
next season.

“At this point in the season, I think our team un-
derstands thar staying morivared is importanr," said
Head Coach Andy Hamilton. "We have ‘rl chance to
send [seniors] Lauren Meredith and Katy Bowen out
on a positive note by winning in our remaining games.
Victories will not come easy rhough, as we are still
trying to find offensive consistency

The Grinnell college mcns basketball squad is currently sitting
in third place in the Midwest Conference and looking to secure a
trip to the MWC Tournament, All they need to do is win.

A split on the road last weekend put the Pioneers one step closer
to their tournament goal.

Grinnell beat Ripon college last Friday, giving Head Coach
Dave Arseneault his ﬁISITCVEl' win at Ripon, but the Pioneers

dropped a rough contest at Beloit College the next day. The split '

pushed Grinnell's Iecord to.12-7 overall and 8—5 in the MWC.

At Ripon, John Grotberg 09, who holds
a narrow lead as the nations leading scorer,
dropped 45 points on the way to a 124 110
victory.

, Davie Arscncault '09 had 18 points and
seven assists. Mike Schmidt ’07 had a @mes
high five steals along with 15 points and
senior Toby Carlson followed close behind
with 13 points.

After nailing by four at the half, Grinnell
came out firing, hitting 23 of 59 three points
ers, taking control of the tempo of the game and bringing in a win
for the Pioneers.

“The win was really important,"said Bobby Long '09."Not only
did we plant ourselves ahead of Knox for the third playottspot but
basically knocked Ripon College out orplayoereontention."

The Pioneers took their momentum down the road to Beloit,
Wise. to face offagainst a middleeorerheepack Beloit team. Howev—
er, there was nothing middle-of-therpack about Beloit last Saturday.
The Buccaneers had Grinnell off-balance for much of the game on

their way to a 120 112 victory over the Pioneers

Long was the leading scorer for Grinnell, putting on an impres-
sive shooting display on his way to 26 points. He went nine for 10
from the field and he was six for seven from behind the arc.

Grotberg scored 24 points, Keith Chamberlain '08 had 12,Trek
Langenhan '07 had 11 and Davie Arseneaulr had 10 points and 10
assists.

Unfortunately the Pioneer scoring was not enough to overtake
BeloitsJosh Hinz, who scored 50 points and grabbed 36 rebounds,
which' is one rebound shy ofthe NCAA Division III record. Beloit
had thiee players score over 20 points during
the game, which allowed rhe Buccaneers re
pull away in rhe second half,

“Beloit did a great job of breaking our
press and keeping the ball in the middle of
the ﬂoor,” said Long. with Josh Hinz on
the other ream,wc had a difﬁcult time getting
offensive rebounds. He had 28 defensive res
bounds by himselfand we had 27 as a team."

Grinnell takes to the road again this
weekend, as they try to secure their playoff
spot with awin at Illinois College.The Pioneers defeated the Blues
boys ofIC earlier this season and are now looking for the season
sweep.

"I'm not sure there are any keys to beating IC on Saturday,"said
Head Coach Dave Arseneault. “After beating Beloit at home by 28
and then losing to them on the road by eight,l would hope our guys
would not be thinking that this will be an easy contest simply be-
cause we beat them soundly at home in earlyJanuary. If we come to
play and continue to shoot the ball well, I like our chances."
