Cross country is Conference Champions

BY BRADLEV IVERSON'LONG

The Grinnell wornen's cross country team started a new legacy.
while the men’s team rolled up another number on their odometer
of dominance, as both teams cruised to ﬁlst place finishes at the
Midwest Conference Championship in Appleton, Wis. last satur—
day. "Having both the men and women shock the conference this
year was amazing" said Justin Riley 'oo. Both teams will next race at
the NCAA Regionals meet in Waverly, Iowa next Saturday.

The path to victory was not an easy one, as the course at High
Cliff State Park was rainesoaked and hill of dangerous trails that
made passing other runners and getting solid footing difficult. “We
were lucky we didn’t have any injuries,” said women's coach Evelyn
Freeman.

The women's team led the waywith 44 points, winning their first
Midwest Conference Championship in nine years. The Pioneers
placed six runners in the top 20, the benchmark for AlleConference
honors.“The team did an outstanding job preparing throughout the
season for the conference meet," said women’s coach Evelyn Free-
man,“and we came through with flying colors,"

First-years Sarah Spencer and Meredith Groves paced the Pioe
neers, finishing second and
fourth overall. Spencer says
that sticking to her game plan
led to her strong ﬁnish. “Eve
eryone went out super fast,”
she said, “My goal was to run
a more even race and a smarter
race. I went out in control and
then was able to pick people
off in the middle when they
were tired."

Also named to the All
Conference team were Katie Ryan ‘07, Lola Garcia ‘06, Erin Sinde»
wald ‘08 and Erin Booth ‘07. Rose Hendricks ‘05, the team's seventh
finisher, crossed the line in 21st place, just missing AlleConferenee
honors "Our top seven were just fantastic,"sa'td Freeman.

The heavily favored Grinnell men’s team won their 18th confer-
ence title in 19 years in commanding fashion, totaling just 25 points
and ﬁnishing 8 runners in the top 14 spots. “Across the board I
thought they were terriﬁc,”said men's coach Will Freeman.

David Honig ‘06 led the Pioneers, ﬁnishing second overall. Othe
er Grinncllians named to the Aleronference ream werejustin Riley
‘06, Colin Tschida ‘05, Mitch Herz ‘05, Omondi Kasidhi ‘05, David
Krist ‘08, Charlie Knuth ‘08 and Adam Beals ‘06. Krist and Knuth
were also the fastest ﬁrst-years overall at the conference meet.

Unlike many opposing runners, the Grin nell men were not train—
ing speeifieally for the conference meet, “The front eighr trained
through the meet” said Freeman. "They didn't back off at all (in
training), because they’re shooting for the NCAA Regionals.”

“This season we've really been working on getting our ducks in
order," said Beals, “and try that I mean seulpring our shelves. our
pecs are like whoa. Chiseled inanehoohs arc the key to sustaining
speed over long distanees, and the rest of the conference simply has
not caught on to this facl.They never stood a ehanee."

In addition to both teams' terriﬁc performances on the course,
both Evelyn and Will Freeman were named Midwest Conference
Coach of the Year, with Will sharing the honor with Monmouth’s
Roger Haynes.

“It's a nice gesture on the part orthe coaches and i appieeiate the
recognition” said Will Freeman. “But truth be told, these [runners]
will make any coach look good."

““The team did an
oustandingjob prepar»
ing throughout the
season for the confer-
ence meet."

Conference
done, it’s
on to
Regionals

With Conference out of the way,
both teams prepare for the next
step—Regionals. The Regional
meet this year will be run at Wartr
burg College in Waverly, Iowa. Both
the men's and women's teams Ian
there a month ago in the Dan Hus-
ton Invite.
The top four teams at Regionals
advance to Nationals. Last year.
with Regionals held in GrinnEll.
the men's team ﬁnished seventh.
Wartburg, this year’s host, ﬁnished
first.
“They know what we’re up
against,” said head coach Will.
Freeman of his runners. "I'm just
trying to keep it low key. They
know what’s on the line.”
On the women’s side, Grinnell
hopes its recent rise in the cross
country world will give it the ele-
ment of surprise.
"We are excited that we are an
unknown,” said Sarah Spencer
’08. "No one has any expectations
for us... but if we all go out. and >
compete welL we have a chance at
making the fourth spot that goes
to Nationals.”
The Pioneers ﬁnished 12th at Re-
gionals a year ago, but have sights
on a much higher ﬁnish this time.
"I think we could make a good
run at trying for Nationals,” said
women’s coach Evelyn Freeman.
