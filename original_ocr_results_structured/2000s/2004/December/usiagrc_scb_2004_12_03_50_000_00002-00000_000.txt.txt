businesses would have to pursue a strategy of
focusing on personal service and higher quality
products.

The Renaud family is interested in selling
their land to Magnum Development Corp, a
ﬁrm from Omaha that does projects through-
out the Midwest. Wal-Mart contacted Mags
hum to express preliminary interest in build
ing on the Renaud property. “I’m looking to
develop 25—26 acres," said Magnum’s Joe Ku-
tileck, “and would like to have WalsMart a part
of that.” If the city approves the annexation
and zones the Renaud property for large-scale
commercial stores such as a Super wal-Mart,
he thought that Wal-Mart would also like to

pursue an expanded storer

The annexation request was originally
rejected, 3—2, hy the Planning and zoning
Committee after high turnout at the commits
tee meeting to speak against the annexation.
Council member Shannon McNaul urged
Planning and Zoning Committee members to
”take the personality out of it.” Legally, the city
couldn't refuse a voluntary annexation request
“just because a particular store might come in
some day," she said. If the motion to annex is
approved, or no action is taken by the 90rday
deadline that arrives in mieranuary, then the
property is added to Grinnell and the issue of
zoning must be discussed.

Protesting the SOA

Grinnelll’ans attend largest protest yet at Fort Benning

BY CAlTLlN CARMODV

Under public pressure, the Pentagon made
public in 1996 an instructional manual used at
the School of the Americas (SOA), 21 training
camp for Latin American military and para-
military forces, that explained how to torture
people. The school has since been closed, rer
named and opened as theWestern Hemisphere
institute for Security Cooperation (WHISC).

The new name hasn’t changed the annual
gathering of protesters in Fort Benning, Ga.
On Nov. 2021, twelve Grinnell students and
a staff member joined 16,000 other protesters
for a twmday demonstration.

On Saturday protesters held an allrday role
ly outside the gates of Fort Benning with mun
sicians and celebrity speakers such as Martin
Sheen and Susan Sarandon. Torture survivors
and children whose parents’ deaths or disap-
pearances have been linked to SOA graduates
also spoke. These graduates are considered re
sponsible for an extensive number ofdeaths in
Latin America.

“Bush said we need to shut down every
known terrorist training camp, and abuse the
countries who harbor it," said Chris Gaunt, a
campus employee who has attended the pro-
test for seven years. “But we’re doing it right in
Georgia, training international terrorists,"

In 2002, Gaunt “crossed the line" and tres—
passed onto school property. Gaunt served 90
days in federal prison and was fined $750, “I
knew I was risking my marriage, family, and
job," she said. “But I stood in front of this big
sign with doves on it and stopped and thought,
‘This is why I’m here."'

Since 1990, when 500 people attended a
reenactment of the murder of six Jesuit priests
in El Salvador, protestors have become increas-
ingly conﬁdent that the annual demonstration

is helping force the nholition of the school. “I
think it will deﬁnitely be shut down soon,"said
Molly OffcrrWestort ‘05. “I would expect it in
the 11ch couple ofyears.” Each year since 1996
there has been a bill in Congress to shut the
school down.

“When you send people like me and priests
and nuns tojail for some peaceful protest, the
word has to get out," Gaunt said. “Butl think
it comes down to a matter of faith and convik
tion and believing. [I] cant say that 1 know its
effective, burl know that I am being faithful to
my inner being."

On Sunday, protesters participate In a
funeral procession, placing crosses with the
names of those whose deaths have been tied
to SOA graduates on the fence of the school.
Meanwhile, these names are read aloud to
those gathered.

For the first time this year, there were two
fences between the protestors and the school.
Now when someone crosses the line, it is al-
most guaranteed that they will be sent to pris»
on for six months—the maximum sentence for
such an oefense. This year, 15 people crossed.

“[The protest] always had a grip on me
from the first time, but this year there was
this hopefulness that came through that just
amazed me," Gaunt said. “it was a group pf
people that was really positive.”

Traditionally, many attendees have been re»
ligious protesters or protesters of college—age.

“The most positive and hopeful thing for
me to see happen was the increase in diver-
sity,"Guunt said. “It used to be all white older
people. [There has been] a real attempt within
movement to increase diversity, and it’s hapr
pening,”
