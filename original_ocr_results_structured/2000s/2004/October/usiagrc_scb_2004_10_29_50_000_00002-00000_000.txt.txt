Students share dining services
concerns at ‘coffee with the
president’

This semester, President Russell Osgood and Vice Presi-
dent for student services Tom Ctady have begun holding
open afternoon coiiecs with snrdcnts.

While the date of the first coffee, in September, was m“,
fused, leading to a lack of attendance, five students attended
the second coffee, held at 4:15 on Monday, Oct. 9 in the Forum
Grill.

several students uscd the time to air grievances about
changes in this semester's dining plans, particularly the abolir
tion of Southern Express. “My primary concern was that there‘s
been a lack ormeal equivalency,” aid Eli Zigas loo.

Osgood and crady cited mainly ﬁnancial reasons for end-
ing the Express meal equivalency. While GrabeNrGo had
been gaining popularity since its introduction, Southern Exr
press had been steadily losing customers, said crady.

Both stressed the transitory nature ofcarnpus amenities as
Grinncll prepares for the construction ofthc Rosenrreld Cam-
pus Center. “We're experimenting," said Osgood.

Matt SChiirr ‘08 pointed out that because first semester
freshmen are required to use the 21 meal plan, they hare no
access tO dining dollars. Osgood claimed he was unaware oi”
this situation and would look into it.

The “Coffees with the prcsidcnt" were the brainchild of
Dayis Harr loo, according to Osgood. “ll-[art] sent an email
with the idea, and we scheduled the first one thinking we’d do
several," said Osgood.

Osgood said rhe cotter discussion went as he had antici-
pated and that he and Crady hoped to Conduct more meclin
ifstudcnts would attend, perhaps on a birweekly hasis,“Th
what I like to do for a living,"said Osgood.

The next “coffee with the president" will be held the week
of Nov. 8,

planned for Halloween night

This Halloween, students will get a chairce to do some old-
school trick-or-ttcating—tight on campus. From 5.5; pm. on
Halloween, more than 40 5A5 and four RLCs will be in their

trickrorrtreaters.

Information will be posted outside of the dorms, giving the
rooms inside each building where trick-or-trcatcrs can receive
candy.

Aurcarnpus triclsrorrtrearing was sraried last year lay Kat
Henry ‘07, with the assistance ofstudent staff members. “I hope
there’s a good turnout," Henry said. “People who did it lasr ycar
had a lot of fun." Characterizing it as a kind of study break,
l-lcnry added that she had high hopes for success.

Scheduling is tavoralrlc to a stronger turnout than last year,
said Henry. Halloween is on a Sunday night this year, “Last
year was a Friday night,” Henry said. "1t’s dimcult ro compete
with partying.”

l—lcnry also added her hope that students with Dayls Buds
dics will participate. “It’s difﬁcult to bring the community to
campus nonnally, especially with the dorms being loc» she
said.
