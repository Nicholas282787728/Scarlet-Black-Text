Why weddings can wai

New Student Orientation has two
purposes: 1) helping the freshman to
make friends, settle into college life
and generally feel the love, and 2) scar-
ing the freshman to death. For every
run and enjoyable ice cream social
that I attended over that fateful
long weekend three years ago, 1
also attended at least one session
about the dangers ofcollcge hfc,
which included alcohol poison-
ing, sexual assault, academic
probation. and marriage.

Yes, marriage] have a vire
id memory ofthe daywhen
some college offrcral
stood up in front
of several hundred
firstrycats, welcomed
us to Grinncll, and informed us that
statistically, well over half of all Grins
nellians marry other GrinnclliansrThcn
he cheerfully told us to look around the
room and see if we spotted any potential
future spouses in the vicinity.

Well, that was enough to make al-
cohol poisoning seem like a day at the
beach. I immediately imagined a hora
rible Princess Bride resque scenario, in

tnuch adohbbut nothing

which a large group of college offrcrals

abducted me from class, put a gun to

my head and marched me to Herrick

chapel, where I would be forced to wed

some Prince Hurnperdrnck clior

sen at mndom out of directory

search. Even the prospect of

rescue by a handsome and

dashing young hero was not

particularly comforting to

me, if such a person had

appeared I probably

would have shook his

hand formally, smrleti,

and said “Why thank

youi 1 hope we can

be friends." Then I

would have retreated

to the ftrCrswamp,

because Rodents of Unusual Sizc don't
require any vows of lrfelong loyalty

Aftei a tow years in college i was

shocked to discover that nobody actur

ally forces Grinneliian corrples to get

married; they actually do it because,

I don't know, they love cach other or

something. They love each other decir

sively. Just think: rrght now, Grinnell's

married and engaged couples are prob

ably contentcdly reﬂecting on the fact
that they know exactly who they want
to spend the rest of their lives with.
Meanwhile, last time the checker at
McNahy’s asited mt: it] wanted paper
or plastic bags, 1 nearly threw my hands
in the air and shouted “I don't know! I’m
still in collegei Don't ask me any real life
questions until May!”

No, dccisivcncss has never been
one of my strong points, and I‘m not so
good at planning the futuie, eithcr.Two
weeks ago my sister called me from
school in Vermont to tell me all about
her new hamster Minerva.

“She’s so cute.’Y Hayley told me Mr
crtctily. “I bought her a wheel, and food,
and I took her to the vet. ,."I hstcned to
all of tlrrs, feelrng ticcply rmpressed, and
thinking “A hamster, wow. I just don’t
think I could handle that kind of coin-
mitmcnt."

I'm telling you these things because
lately I feel like thcrc have becn an
extraordinarily large number of Grins
nell engagements and weddrngs lately.
I picked up the first issue of the 8&3
this semester and found that out of four
opinion columns, one mentioned the

author’s engagement, and anothcr was
all about a wedding, All ofthis nuptial
bliss makes me feel that irritating kid
in your History class; I have an over»
whclming urge to play Devil's Advoe
Cater

I think there are .1 lot of us who
think marriage is pretty much the oCﬂKk
est thing imaginable iight now. Person~
ally, in order to avoid even the most
Britney Spcars-csquc marriage, I would
happily rake the GREs several times
over. I would even take the biochemist
rr-y GR}: wrrlr Darth Vader as the procs
tor. Hell, I would do this just to avoid
weddingrgown slroppurg, let alone act
tual matrimony

So, if you are a committmentophobe,
I want you to know that you are not
alone. 1am wirhyoul weltlam with
you in a completely platonic sort ofway,
no pressure implied, i swear. There will
be plenty of time for our sort to worry
about marriage in the far offdistant ﬁle
turc, like maybe when hell freezes over.
If you’re feelrng ambitious before then,
though, I hear that hamsters make nice
companions, and even R.O.U.S.s aren’t
all bad.

Pirate adventure in the modern world

The Strait ofMalacca is casilyone ofthc world's most
important waterways. Tens of thousands of shrps yearly
pass through the strait, carrying a quarter of the world’s
oceangoing commercial cargo. The us. earlier this year
expressed concern that the strait may prove a target for
terrorists seeking to disrupt rhc world economy. How»
ever, Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. the countries
bordering the Strait, have a more immediate concern:
prracy Not software prraey, but piracy on the high seas.
with looting, pillaging, plundering, and all sorts ofothcr
fearsome activities. The Strait and neighboring wateis
are the world's center ofcontemporary piracy, with well
over a hundred (documented) attacks each year menac-
ing travelers and traders and the commerce of littoral
nations.

Amidst the struggle against the pirates, Malaysia’s
most famous agitator, Anwar Ibraliim,was recently re,
leased after six years rrr jail as the Federal Court Over
turned his conviction of sodomy. In 1998 Mr. Anku,
then die deputy prime minister and finance minister,
took the wrong position on then Prime Minister Maha-
thir Moharnad's emergency economic policies, and was
accordingly fired. Mr. Anwar began opposing the gOVr
emment,a disposition that Mr, Mahathir never apprecir
ated, and was promptly tried and convicted on trumped
up charges. Hrs release, while technically because the
case against him was obviously inadequate, is widely
seen as being at the behest of Dr. Mahathir’s recent stic-
cessor Abdullah Badawi.

Tire opposition may hope that Mr. Anwar’s release
will be invigorating after a sound defeat by the ruling
party in parliamentary elections earlier this year, but

what fallout is to be on the Malaysian political landscape
is not easy to predict. Mr. Anwar is stilled ban-ed from
public office, as a separate conviction foi corruption
(also on questionable grounds) has not been overturned,
and Malaysian law prevents a convict from holding of
frcc for frvc years after the completion of thci enrencc.
The sentence for the corruption conviction crp' d only
last Apr-ii, nit, Anwar- is still rryrug to have the second
conviction overturned in court, and should that fail may
still present a charismatic face for the opposition,but his
release rs one ofa series ofprogressrve decrsrorrs grantrng
Mr. Abdullah a robust popularity, and perhaps enough
so to steal the opposition’s reformist thunder.

As pohtical repression is (maybe) gingerly
receding in Malaysia, across the strait Indone-
sia’s first ever direct election of a president has
been concluded, seemingly with successThe
ballots haven't been entirely counted, but
enough have been that the winner rs clear,
the challenger susilo BambangYudl'ioytr
no defeating the incumbent lvlcgawati
Sukarnoputri handily Tire ruuotf
is the third successful poll of the
year, being preceded by a parliar
mentary election in April and
a ﬁrstrround presidential poll
in July. The elections are at the forefront of a remark
able reversal in Indonesia’s political character. While the
Asian ﬁnancial crisis of1998 set off little more crisis in
Malaysia than some small rumbhngs ofdissent and the
jailing of Anwar Ibrahim, Indonesia, seemed about to
come apart at the seams, rocked by protests, riots, racial

violence, and a regime change. Now ludoncsia's gover-
nance appears substantively more democratic than Ma-

laysias even if its resilience remains to he tested
The more Malavsia and lndonesm change, the more
Singapore stays the same. Lee Hsreu Looug became the
city-stares third ever prime minister who he rook ofs
fice' in August. Singapore‘s first prime minister was Mi.
Lee's father Lcc Kuan Yew, who assumed the post on
Singapore's birth as a nation in 1959 srngapore's second
prime minister, Goh ChokTong, quite willingly handed
over power over to Mr, Lee, and remains a senior adr
visor and member of Mr. Lee’s cabinet Mr. Lee offers
little ieason to suspect anything but more of the same
foi Singapore under his reign; competent, peacer
ful, and not very dcmocmtic rule, likely for a long

, time to come.

Of course, what pohrical reforms there
may be in countries neighboring the Strait
ofMalacca has little directly to do with the
pirates therein, and an astute reader may notice
that Little room remains in the column for
diematic development along that line.
To be honest,I only mentioned pl’
racy because I needed more words
for this column, and pirates are
thought to be exciting, and I
was just hoping to lure the dimmer and less avid of the
stat; readership into reading about the social affairs
of forergu peoples. And you know what> Pirates aren't
fun, or cool. They re a murderous menace to decent
p.eople Why dont you stop daydreaming about pirates
and get a fucking social conscrence. Jerk

The ultimate badass

i’ve been thinking about this a lot lately, and i’vc
concluded that' i am the ultimate badass. 1 am in a con—
stant state of rebellion against any and all ﬁgures of
authority that may or may not control any aspect of
ﬁle status quo, and not onlytl-iat,buti also rebel against
the major rebel groups. the state, the communists, pop,
., gjpprnative, tap, etc. i ﬁéet them all, impossible as it
ay seem, and reﬁne to conform to any standard or set
of rules that society or anyone else may create for me.
the nudists want me to not wear clothes, i wear em
sodety begs me to wear clothes, i take em oﬁ'. the real
te’bcls'are the ones who refuse both to rebel and not
to rebel, the ones who are in a constant state of being
half—dressed and half naked. the ones who have no real
taste for music or much of anything really. in short, the
true rebels arc the kevin marcotis of the world, i'd ask
you to join me in my apathetic rebellion, bur then i‘d
be selling out now wouldn't i.>
