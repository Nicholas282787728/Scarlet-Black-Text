"Coming Out Week is a week of events

make Grinnellians know that Gtinnell is a
safe plac: to come out if they are at a point
in their life when they are thinking about it,"
said Sarah Lu ’07, a co-leader of StoneCo.

coincide with Oct. 11, National Coming Out
Day.

Changes

At the beginning ofthe semester, SGA ins
stituted several changes aimed at simplifying
the process otapplying tor SGA funding.

Doja Kliandkar ‘05, treasurer of SGA, il-
lustrated the changes with an example. ”Last
year, when Derek Chandler was trying to or—
ganize the hipehop concert, he had to apply
for funding to three different places 7 us, the
concert chair and ACE [All Campus Events],"
he said. “Under this new structure, he coultl
obtain funding by just one application to one
fund."

Last year, SGA had five financial Commlt’
tees: ACE, Finance, Concerts Discretionary
(CD), sports Club Discrctionary and Cabi—

co-sponsored the event.

“This year tour otrhe eight people on the
leadership of the Stonewall Coalition and the
Stonewall Resource center
are people who identify as
people of Color," Lu said.
“The gay rights movement
is traditionally a very white,

Monday’s “Sex Signals
Gone Cheer” was an event
in “response to the Sex Signals performance
during orientation," said Lu, which “while
funny, informative, and educationally valuable,
only addressed issues regarding heterosexual
relationships." lr "ended up being an improv

pottant perspective and it has the potential to
be very, very entertaining.”

Other new events for Coming Out Week
were a showing of the movie But I’m 11 Come
lender and a “Gender 101 Discussion," which
focused on transgender issues.

While it was not in-
volved in planning this
week’s events, the Coming
Out Group is another cam-
pus organization dealing
with issues of sexuality. Lest
tct Aleman ‘07, a facilitator
in the group and the assise
tant director of the Slonbr
wall Resource Center (SRC), said the group is
a discreet group, "a safe space for people to talk
about their sexuality.”

The group does not openly advertise its
meeting times and places.‘ ‘preople are intel'r

about their sexuality, they email the group aCr

count [cog@grinnell.edu]," said Aleman. The
idea is not for students to come out publicly,
but rather “to engage themselves in what they
think their sexuality is," he continued

other Stoneco activities this year include
organizing Pride Weelc events in April and
working on bringing Queer studies classes to
Grinneu. “We’re trying to er a queer studies
class on campus [next years, and before that,
for next semester, there will be a guided reads
mg on queer studies," said Lu. “Just like race,
class and gender are frames of analysis that
people view history and sociology and asthma
pology with, we’re trying to make sexuality one
of those, too."

organized under two large funds a ACE and
and the newlyeformed Student Programming
Committee (SPC).

The SPC funds eveiything that is not a
campus event, and, according to loiaiidkar, is
basically an enlarged Finance Committee with
a new name. "Now, sports clubs cum in their
budget to SPC instead otto the rieasuier,”said
Klmndkal’. “This is a mom democratic process
of giving out money In addition, it is easier
for the clubs because if [they need funds in]

The former CD fund now falls under the
purvrew of ACE, With restrictions lifted on
funding for food, lodging and transportation.

The Cabinet Discretionary Fund has been
replaced by an Enieigency Fund. Also, the Stu-
dent Educational Policy Committee (SEPC)
fund has been dissolved; the SEPC now ap-
plics to ACE for funding.

“We didn't really have all these different
committees to begin witli,"says Doja. “We just
made various interim committees when the
need arose. For example, last year we had a lot
of people asking for performance/concert type
funding, so the informal Concerts Discretionz
ary [was] set up.Whatwe are trying to do now
is to organize these funding committees that

were informally set up to meet student de
mands."

The budgetrmaking process is at the dis
cretion of the SGA treasurer, but this year’s
changes reﬂect the recommendations of last
springs SGA Budget Steering Committee,
