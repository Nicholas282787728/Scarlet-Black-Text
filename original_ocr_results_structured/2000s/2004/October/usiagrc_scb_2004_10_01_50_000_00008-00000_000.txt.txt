Rivers and Tides (NR)

One model for artistic output is Henry David
Thoreau, who lived a secluded life within nature to
produce an Walden Pan/l. Andrew Goldrworthy fol—
lows a different model—instead of using nature as a
barrier and ﬁlter from society, he uses nature to create
art that is wholly a part of an environment,

River: and Tidnxﬂrldy Goldiwmt/i l Walking with
Time is a chance to hang out With the British “envi-
ronmental altist” and watch him build super art from
supplies he finds in narure. Thomas Riedclsheimcr,
the man behind the camera, includes interviews with
Goldsworthy, but most of the film is spent watching
him take nature walks and create new pieces.

Yes, Goldsworthy spends his time making glori-
fied salidcastles and snowballs. Hc is the prototyin
cal artist that contributes nothing of substance to
society. All his arrangements ofdandelions remain in
wild meadows and his ice sculptures can‘t last more
than a few hours. However, Goldsworthy does give
to his fans and movie watchers the inspiring vision
that, withjust a little rearranging, we can unleash the

sublime beauty of our world.

To combat the temporary nature ofhis art, Goldr
sworthy rakes photographs, and new stars in a movie.
This film works well with his art, since so much of
nature, like rivers and tides, is in a continuous state
ofﬂux.Thcn again, Grinncllians can see a real Golds
sworthy piece. He constructed a limestone cairn on
the prairie at CERA ‘in 2001 that still stands.

Riam and Tide: is not a ﬁinny movie for wasted
people. You’ll have to wait until December for Harald
and Kumar Ga Ta Whit: Carl/c. But it is a meditative
movie that might inspire you to ﬁnish your submis»
sions for the Grime/l Rea/ism or take more walks

Meet the Parents (PG-13)

Ben Stiller is back, and less funny than ever in
a movie thar tries to make jokes out of male nursr
es, milking cats and overﬂowing septic tanks. Stiller
plays Greg Pocker (yes, almost an F—bomb), a nice
guy nurse who meets his girlfriend’s parents, includ-
ing Robert DcNiro, who are crazy.

While this movie strip mines all the awkward ma
terial of meeting funire ln’lﬂWS, it doesn’t reﬂect the
experiences of myself or most of the Grinnellians I
know. Girls’ parents are awesome Moms especially
have the best gossip and aren't afraid to sell out their
daughters. Heck, my girlfriends' parents have gorrcn
me Christina Aguilera tickets, let me sleep in their
house, and occasionally even done my laundry. So
while Ben Stiller may hate all your parents visiting for
Parents'Weekend,1 wish you all a pleasant stay and
remind you that my hamper is full.

Cold Mountain (R

Although you may be ﬁred up for an intense his
torical drama,lude Law with an unkempt beard is as
good a reason to see this ﬁlm as any. Cold Moun-
tain, a movie about the Civil War filmed in the foggy
hills of Romania, stars an Australian, an Englishman
and a Texan in a battle for America’s heart. I was a
little skeptical from the start. Also, knowing thatJude
Law's character, lnman, ﬁghts for the South reluc—
tantly, made me worry that the ﬁlm would not be as
impassioned as I have grown to expect a Civil War
drama to bet

The ﬁlm is exciting but somewhat formulaic. Boy
(Law) meets pretty girl (Nicole Kidrnan), boy goes off
to war, girl meets another less— cultured girl (Renee
Zellweger) and they set up house and wait for boy to
come home Meanwhile, the boy, having deserted the
army. hangs out with just abour every colorful charace
ter in the South, including Natalie Portman and her
baby and an old lady who heals his ills by killing a
goat. Perhaps Cold Mountain is best watched by the
non-discriminating movie-lover—it manipulates at
every turn with death, suffering, bad weather and just
a little bit orbnby-making. Plus, it's simply beautiful.
The Romanian “Blue Ridge Mountains," Kidman's
rosy Australian cheeks and a bluegrass soundtrack led
by the exquisite Yankee Alison Krauss sink you into
the luscious sadness of the film.

At two and a half hours, Cold Mountain, is a good
Family Weekend event to take your morher [o ifyou
want to hear hcr cry about somcrhiug other than how
much you've grown up and how lonely ir is at home
without you. Or you could go just for Jude Law. 567
cause he is ﬁne as hell. And your mom will probably
agree.
