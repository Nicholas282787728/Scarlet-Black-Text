Working hard for diversity
We, the members of the Advisory Board of

the Center for the Humanities, are committed
to the importance of diversity as a core value
of the College and the Center. That is why
we extended three of our ﬁrst Six invitations
to reininist scholars of color when we began
organizing this year's activities on feminist
scholaiship.

We regret that none of these invitations
were accepted. However, contrary to the stag
gestion ofa recent column in the 5658, the ab
sence of racial diversity among the four visit-
ing professors this semester was due neither to
complacency nor to a failure to follow through
on our commitment to diversity.

In the future, we will continue to work hard
to attract scholars of color to our activities,
In the four years since the Center for the Hus
manities began operations, ‘thit-rititins to serve

X-amine your YKK

Dear Sir,

start it my crotch long enough and you
will see a top quality zipper bearing the trade
mark YKK. The Yo shitla Kogyo Kabushikir
kiisha Group controls almost 45 percent ofthc
543 billion annual zipper market Founded in
1934 by Tadao Yoshida YKK Group now opr
crates in no countues employing some 37, 000
people, with a Us plant in Macon, Georgia
producing 7 mi on ippers every day. It was
in Macon that Yo. iirla’s intimate and lasting
friendship with Jimmy carter began. Yoshida
was not a figure tree from controversy, allega-
tions of his cult like worship within the corn-
pany persisted up until his passing away in
1993, fuelled by his alleged ban on golfplaying

by any YKK employees. His U,Srcducated
son and the YKK Group’s current head,Tadar
him Yoshida, is no stranger to the pleasures of
a day on the Links.

Alas, all is not well for Japan’s and the
world's #1 producer of clothing fasteners.
Roughly 30 percent of global zipper produc—
tion is in the hands of small Chinese firms,
some of which illegally brand their zippers
with the YKK trademark, cutting into YKK's
business and lessening the reputation for pro-
ducing none but the highest quality zippers
that \’KK Group has nurtured over the last 70
years.

\oshidii imputed his personal philoso—
phy to the company that bears his name, the
Cycle of Goodnc . . lccinctly starcs ”No one
prospcrs unless he renders benefit to others". I
implore this newspaper's readers to keep this
in mind should you encounter difficulties with
what may appear to be a YKK Croup prod
uct.

Respectfully Submitted {oi the Consider-
azion ofrhe College community,

Past-break stress disorder

I believe that students are suffering from :m epi-
demic ofpost-breik stress disorder. Fall Break strips
dwayall motivations to be productive during students'
week-long stay in bliss: it state of happiness that oc—
curs when students are freed from the pressures of
the standard work week and are allowed to venture
forth from campus and travel to elsewhere, which
may be defined as “:inywhctt: but academic build-
ings," engage in sleeping--a state ofuneonsciousness
that is purported to have revitalizing properties» rid
eating healthily by avoiding fried edible products
from (hind or Cowles. Upon returning to uncom—
fottablc. squeaky chairs in frigid ARI-l, cut-naps in
front‘ot computers, and consumption of expensive
(yet unappetizing) calories, 1 have decided that there
is only one possible recourse: emit blame. sadly, the
true culprit is Fall Break, as upon its conclusion we
must now transcend our complaints, for what we
Want and what we need has been confused.

What’s up?

Instead of Hi,"“Hey," or even just a head nod,
people continue to baffle me by inquiring Whats
up? as a means ofacknowlcdglng my presence as
they saunter past me on their mei-ryway It doesn‘t
even sound like a question People say it like its a
statement of some sort. I don’t know what to do with
that. You isked me what‘ 5 up and now you re
walking tiwa Should I run after you and tell you
that] got 2 5 hours ofslccp, didnt do any of the
homewmkl should have, have no clean clothes, can't
find my shoes, ate shit for dinner (as usual), have a
5200 cell phone bill to pay, and am, in fact having
the day from hell? Because that's “what’s up". May—
haps a simple “Hey"would suffice.

SGA voter suppression

The Blackboard voting systemis conducive to
voting failure. If you follow rlre link to the onlinc
elections, then select the link to view the candidatcs’
St‘awmml!§,)’0ll get locked out nfthe ballot. It is dif-
ficult to say how many people have encountered this
and similar problems but in an electoral process where
decisions are made by as little as 19 votes (Grimm
V's. Barnum - March ‘04) the disenfranchised voters
could make all the difference. I warn Fill students
voting in future elections to, after selecting “take this
assessment now,” complete and submit the ballot imr
mediately. 1 also call for a redesign in the system such
that: the ballot window does not have links to other
parts of the website that would invalidate the form,
and candidates’ statements appear in a new window
once a user has opened the ballot page.

‘ Students speak
out about what's
on their minds in
142 words or less,
and you're invited!
If you have a rant,
email it to
rathooja@
grinnell.edu.
After all, com-
plaining in a pub
lic forum is always
more fun than
doing it alone,
