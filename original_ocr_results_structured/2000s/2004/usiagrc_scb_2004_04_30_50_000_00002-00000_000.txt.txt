Playing with sex toy

by Lauren Standifer

Laura and Gypsy from Ruby's Pearl in iowa
City were a little late getting to Grinnell, but
once they were ready to set up, a series ofritillal»
ing, fascinating, romantic and sometimes just
plain funny objects started appearing from their
giant cardboard box of tricks. Some ofthe items

some, like Anarchy magazine and the feminist
publication Birch, were a bit more ofa surprise.

Gypsy opened a package With a light prnk

were ready to start teaching Sex Toys 101.

rolling to bring Laura and Gypsy to campus she
was inspired by an incidcnrslie heard about. I was
told daat somebody asked their HSC about where
they could get vibrarois in Grinnell, and the HSC
was kind afar a loss," site said

Winter was eager to fill the gap. The massive
rumour for rile Masrurbarian Workshop liosrcd
by the Feminist Action Coalition last semester
made her conﬁdent that there was a, demand here
for sexual information. “Ir seems like people or
Grinnell, when rhey’re given an outlet m discuss
sexuality, are really excited about it,” she said,

Members of GASP were also eager to have an
event that would include men as well as women.
“The masrurbation workshop was specifically for
women," said Elisa McCool ‘06, anorher GAS?
member, “and we nonred to open that up.“

Winter heard abour Ruby’s Pearl from orher
Grinnellians. McCool rhinks it was an :xcellenr
choice because Ruby’s Pearl is an explicitly f:mi»
nisr store. “It’s a cool activist organization, so
people can Feel good about sexuality rather than

one ofonly seven sex shops in the entire country
owned by women.

when Winter visited, she found that she
greatly preferred the atmosphere of the store to
othetsimilarshops she’d been to, “it’s a very com»
fottable space," she said. “They have all sons of
other things there that are women-friendly and
women's political things, Thay’rc also very y}!

When Winter contacted the store, she found

would pay $200 for a two.hour presentation. For
the ﬁrst hour iaura and Gypsy would lecture,
and for thesecond haltthey would open the ﬂoor
to questions and take orders rot various prod-
ucts, as well as selling some books, magazines
and smaller merchandise on the spot. Depend.
ing on how much they earned from sales, the

rrnrron wns supportive and gave the group iund.

When the hour of the event arrived, prusersby
peering inro the window of loose lounge could
see a circle of about 30 students, mosdy female,
listening to Gypsy and Lauracncrgciicallycxpound
on a wide range ofscx-rclatcd topics. Aside rrom
discussing rhe use or many or their produers and
passing a few, such as the renowned Rabbit vibta.
tor, around the room, they candidly informed ea.
ger listeners about erogenous zones on men and
womenfemaleeiacrdntion and laws that make nm»
ning a sex shop difﬁculr.

“I think that enhancing pleasure and reach.
ing people about their bodies and how to get the
most out orrheir bodies and their lovemaking is
really important,“ Gypsy said afterward. “it’s an
important part of the balance ofhealrh.”

GAsP, which was created last year, has no
intention orsropping here when it comes ro
opening Grinnell up to public dialogue about
set. “We never had time to really get any events
going.” eo—iounder Josh Rosenbiuh '05 said, “but
i'm really glad to see that things are starting to
come about."

The organization plans to follow up rhe Sex
