Thoughts on smoking from the VP

Arrer consideiarion, rhonghr nnd discussion, I have decided rhar
lam wholehearredly in favor oro rota], complcre ban on smoking—
in Mnin Lounge. As (or rhc resr ordie campus, however, I have no
indiearion rliar nny policy which devisrss rrorn rho srnius quo is nee.
essary, beyond ineorporoiing addirional doiins inro rhe eurrenr syse
rem. Thanks in blnekbonrd, l don‘r feel alone in rhese sentiments: in
rhis week‘s poll or rlie srndenr body, 69% of respondenrs did 'nor
snpporr Lhe iiiiplemeiirnrion orn smoke-free residence life sysrem is
early as nekr seincsrer. Even in rhe context on longer rcmpornl scnlc,
dnsric resiricrions ngainsr smoking nrc nor supporrcd by rhc vise
mnioriry ofstudenrs: under 16% onolled students wanted ro see
smoking banned on an indeﬁnite rime senle and under 17% orsrue
denr Iaponse supporred even a gindunl iinplemeiirnrion ofslizli a
sysrein

on rhe oilier side orrhe mnrrer, rhe srudenr body hns roundly
reiccrcd ividcsprend smoking privileges, as only 10% orrcspnndcnis
indieneed support for o pnliey ihnr perinirs smoking in in residence
areas by dernulr. wirh no oprion For n ﬂoor vore,

These data lend me ro eonclude rhnr rhe eurreiir sysrein is Mir

Which brings me ro comiiieni on whnr broughr obour rhis disa

Response
to Ben Gum

Seiler, cont. from p.11

pnrrinrchnl and porroniiing ro srudenn, rhe majoriry oiwhom are
considered adulrs by law.

1 agree wirh Mr. Eeksrur rlior rhis should be a selngovernanee
issue, because enforcemenr ofany policy rhar bans smoking in rhe
dorms will inevirably involve what srudenrs can and cannot do in
men own living spooes. securiry cannot police rlie lloors ofrhe dorms
all hours or rhe day irihe policy does nor perinir smoking even in
ones own room. Will sns be made in rcporr violarors orrlic policy
on rheir ﬂoors? And ifrhis is rhe cast, rhen whar will prevenr rhem
from being made to reporr aleohol in rooms ofrhos: under twenty
one?

i do nor mean ro suggesr rhor rhis will occur or all (since I have
heard sceand-lialid rharTom Crady hos srored rlinr ifrhe ban is insri.
rured, ir will be a selr.governsnce son or enforcement), bur ir re.
mains a fearsome possibiliry i do nor wish ro see rhe speerer oﬂn hm
pnieiim revived as Grinnell policy and despire Professor Gum's valid
concerns forstudenr heolrh, rliis issue should be resolved only vvirh a
subsrnnriol emouni orsrudenr inpur. Even ifrhe lounges and com»
mon areas are made nonsmoking (and rhere are valid nrgumenrs for
rhar). I would hope rhar rhe ndminisrravion will allow snidenrs ro do
as rhey please in rheir own living spaces, ar rhe very leasr.
