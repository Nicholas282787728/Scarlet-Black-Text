September 3 2004

Over the summer, one ﬁlm served as a re-
minder thatin each of us there lies a really awk—
ward nerd who likes drawing monsters and play-
ing tetherball poorly, a nerd who fails' In nearly
all‘social interaction, has pathetic friends and
whose family is even more ridiculous and awk-

_ ward then he. I was reminded of this twice.
_ Yes, I saw it twice, and willingly, the ﬁrst
viewing Was a planned prologue to an Im-
planned night of chain smoking and wandering
around Providence, R. 1. until morning. The sec-
*ond time was in a spontaneous and incoherent
attempt to buy a kiddy pool at CVS, because it
,was wicked hot ouBide, that instead Landed me
in, yes, that’s right, Napoleon Dynamite. How
I actually got there Is unimportant; the thing
that matters is that it was totally sweetl.
. , Looking back on my Napoleonﬂynamite er
pen‘ences, I see that the awkward randomness
and use of the words "gosh!" and ”sweet!” over
and over again sum up my, and probably lots
of other Gn‘nnellians’, summers pretty welL My
family tends to take on ridiculous ventures just
as Napoleon’s does; I’m not ven] good at drawA
ing but think I am: and yes, ”ligers are pretty
much my favorite animal. It’s like a lion and a
tiger mixed... bred for its skills in magic."

Also Napoleon Dynamite, in many ways, is a
look into a microcosm very similar to the one
that exists here at Grinnell, so it serves not only
as entertainment, but also a way to ease In to
life in our small Midwestern town.

Christopher Pike
The Wicked Heart '

Stumbling upon the teen paperbacks shelves in Stewart Library this July, I
picked the strangest looking book, whipped out my bright orange library card
and dove into the strange concoction that is Christopher Pike’s The Wicked
Heart.

The wicked heart in question belongs to Dusty Shame, a misfit high
schooler who smashes girls' skulls in with a hammer while they Sleep~MaX~
well's Silver Hammer comes to mind—and spirits them off, leaving only a
swastika-embossed card. We follow Sheila Harboldt, his amiable classmate, as
she tries to decipher why this is happening.

Oddly enough, Heinrich Himmler, the head of the Nazi 5.5., playsa part in
this unlikely‘history lesson. Let’s just say that his evil lingers, as evil is apt
to do in a horror novel. Our heroine Sheila’s hopeful approach and far»reach-
ing quest for justice against any and all evil would tug at any Grin'nellian’s
heartstrings.

That’s the problem with teen paperbacks—you pick them up for a quick
read and they stick with you for the rest of the summer, for better or worse.
Christopher Pike’s books tend to do that, with their often apocalyptic prem-
ises and seemingly random twists. In the battle against evil, this belated
convert to teen horror novels will be armed with the knowledge gained from
her trashy summer reading.

It takes a pretty good album to drag me away from playing Super Nin-
tendo in the summer, but when Iﬁrst heard The Killers on the radio I didn't
waste time in picking up their debut album ”Hot Fuss." Nearly all of the 11
songs are fast and loveable rockers filled to the brim with driving guitars,
retro—synthesizer lines, and catchy lyrics. While most ”summer albums" lack
substance, "Hot Fuss” holds up even after repeated listening. The album's
first four tracks contain the two singles and immediate favorites, “Somebody
Told Me" and "Mr. Brightside.” But it's the brilliant retro-rocking tracks later
in the album like ”Midnight Show” and ”Change Vour Mind," with more lyri-
Eal complexity and inventiveness, that prove that this album is built around
more than just a single song. Like Super Nintendo, it’s clear that The Killers'
”Hot Fuss" won't be falling out of my favor anytime soon.

Some remember the summer of 2004 as John
Kerry’s emergence from the pack as a middling
presidential candidate. For others, it was the
summer of Trading Spouses, Foxs superb gender
critique. For me, though this has been the "SurII~
mer of KenJen”

Ken Jennings, for the unenlightened, is the
awe- and ire-inspiring 38»time champion of Jeop-
ardy! His knowledge is as deep as his Mormon
beliefs. He knows all the potent potables, despite
being a teetotaler

Besides being a walking, talking, always— —smil-
ing dictionary, Jennings hasjust enough personal-
ity to be a cult hero. Fans tuned in for the nightly
variation ofthe KenJen show‘ What shape will he
write his name? which of his many great accents
will he use? Will he ﬁnally break the single- day
record of $52, 000 (which he ﬁnally did on day
38, after tying it three times)? Will Alex Trebek
act on his visible urges and make sweet love'to
Ken, behind the blue screen podium? ,

Jennings’ run has inspired drinking games,
fansites and endless debate about who could ever
beat him. Bill Gates? No! Steven Hawking? No!
Me? But of course!

A little part of my summer ended on July 23,
when KenJen won $75,000 on the Jeopardy! sea-
son finale. Sure, I could go out at night, but I'd
have nothing to talk about. Kerr filled the sum
mer TV gap so perfectly. Fortunately, that gaping
hole in all our lives will be ﬁlled this Monday,
when Jeopardyl, with KenJen, starts its let 5er
son. I'll see you in loose at 4:30.
