Carfounders of the Students for the
Smoking ofHookahs (SSH) Joseph Gryklt‘Oé
and Davis Hart‘Oé have yet to hold a meeting,
but the group’s existence and budget have al-
ready raised questions for Student Amers, the
Student Programming Committee (SPC) and
SGA.Altliough SSH was granted othcial stir
dent group status, the budget Hurt and Grykn
submitted to the SPC last Monday, Sept. 20
included $99.95 for a hookah.Tlie budget was
not unanimously approved by the members
present nr rhe spc meeting and was rhus put
on the Joint Board agenda for rho following
nighr.

“What 1 was really concerned about was
the liability factor," said Doja Kliandkar ‘05,
SGA treasurer and liaison between the SPC
and Joint Board, Khiindkar did some research,
which included speaking to Vice President for
Strident Services Tom Crady and Vice Presi—
dent of Institutional and Budget Planning
Jonathan Brand, and deduced that rhere was a
risk that whoever purchases the hookah could
be held responsible should the hookah test
positively for traces of marijuana. Crady was
told by a trooper in the State Patrol Office that
he would consider a hookah drug parapherna-
lia and would arrest someone in possession
ot’one, then test the hookah for non»tobacco
substances.

The SPC deliberated whether or not they
could tnist a student group with an item that
could possibly be used for pot. “We were not

convinced that they could give us adequate re-
assuianee that it would not be misused in the
future," said Kli-dndkai. “Even though we can
trust these people to lead the hookah group rt:-
sponsibly, wherhcr future leaders could do that
is not a risk that we wanted to take."

In order ro remain under the purview of
the SPC. a srudenr group's budget must be apt
proved unanimously; irir is not, the budget is
then presented in front of
Joint Board.

“We want to ask them what the law is from
an unbiased legal cxpert,"snid Harthnformr
narely, that takes time,"

Although rhey admit that rhe approval of
their budget hinges on the issue of liability,
Harland Gryka believe that the group is being
judged on moral or personal grounds as well.
“This whole issue I think is tied up in people’s
moral and ethical beliefs about smoking," said

Hart. “There are studenrs

The budget went be-
fore Joint Board and was
tabled last week after SGA
requested more informa-
tion about liability issues int
volved in the purchasing ota

cerfoundcrs requested that
the issue he tablcd again
this week to give them more
time to investigate the po-
rential for SGA being held
legally responsible for the
purchasing of the hookah
should it be labeled drug
paraphernalia.

“l think it‘s important
not to associate any
valuejudgments about
purchasing a hookah...
I think ultimately it
needs to be clear that
the reason we are
staying away from this
is that it has the po-
tential to get us into

Joint Board, Does SGA m,
ally want to sponsor an imr
healthy thing? Judging by
the fact that SGA sponsors
Harris pi\rtics,l don’t think
there's too much concern
about that"

Khandkar, however,
said than hc is proud orthe
SPC for not passing judge
merits on budgets in the
past and he didn‘t feel that
it was appropriate to do so

Hart and Gryka requested another week to
give them more time to hear back from sev-
eral legal consultants'l‘hcy have coniacred the
district attorney, a county attorney, the state
attorney general and a civil rights attorney in
Iowa and have not yet received a straight nnr
swer about liability.

in this case, either. “I think it’s important not
to associate any value judgments ubour pure
chasing a hookah "

“I think ultimately it needs to be clear that
the reason we are staying away from this is
that it has the potential to get us into trouble,"
Khandkar continued.

The SGA Constitution says that the eolr
loge cannot grant “any requests that fund alco—
hol or tobacco purchases." lorandlorr says that
he tends to read the constitution fairly liber-
ally and felt that as long as the college was not
paying for tobacco itself, the purchase would
nor he a violation or the Constitution. Crady,
however, is still concerned with this bylaw in
relation to the purchasing ofa hookah, as well
as the more serious issue ofliability.

To curtail the issue of the college paying
for the hookah, the suggestion was made at
both the SPC and Joint Board meetings that
the members of SSI—l pool their money and
purchase the hookah themselves. Both Hart
and Gryka felt like the private ownership of
the hookah would defeat the purpose offormr
ing a student group.

“By having SGA buy it, it is explicitly
purchased with the intent of being used by
the students and owned by the snidents," said
Gryku. "If it’s owned by any private party, then
there's no incentive for that to happen."

Hart agreed. “The point of the group re-
ally is to get money to purchase a hookah from
SGA,” he said. “It’s a cheap rhing. Five people
could ger together and throw in 20 bucks each,
but it’s not owned by the students. It's not the
same ideology."

Assuming they are ready to present their
budget next week, the co—foundets of SSH
will ﬁnd out at Tuesday's joinr Board meeting
whether or not SGA will purchase a hookah
for their student group.
