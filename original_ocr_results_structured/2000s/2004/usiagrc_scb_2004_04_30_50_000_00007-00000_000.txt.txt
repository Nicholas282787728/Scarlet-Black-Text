Jason Carpp 06 and Mark Gardiner '05 stare
out over the heads of the audience, looks of an»
guish and rear on their faces, the hopelessness or
their characters laid bare. Within the span ofsec-
onds their comical hauter has given way to dead
time. Pracrioed silence interrupted by short, des-
perate lines make the tension born orsheer deadly
boredom tangible to the audience This is a scene
from the masterpiece \V/Iitr'ligﬁr Godot that direc»
tor Miguel Train ‘04 has decided to mke an dais
semester. which will be performed May 1 and 2 at
a p.m. at the Wall.

Withigﬁn‘ Godot is a play by Samuel Beckett
that is ahour just that two people named Estntgon
(Gardiner) and Vladimir (Carpp) waiting rotsorne—
one named Godot who never comes and trying to
{end on boredom day in and day out. The other
characters they happen to encounter in their wait
are P0110 (Paul Wainrrght ’07), Lucky (Emily
Markovirz, ‘05) and an anonymous hoy (Nick
Timmct ‘05)»

Some members oFrhe cast, like Wainright, read

the play earlier
and loved it. “I
was really ex.
cited about
having some-
one do a pro
duction of it,"
he said. Trejo,
like many orhet
ﬁrst-time teard-
ers of Waiting
ﬁr Sadat, was
not an instant
fan. He said
that when he
read the play in
high school, “I
didn’t under»
stand it and I
didn’t like it, frankly." It wasn‘t until Ttejo worked
with scenes from swear the National Theatre
lnstitute rhar he developed an appreciation for the
plays nuances 1 really found out what a lot of the
roots arthe play are: hesaid. Knowing the ongms
or the plays style ut Vaudeville, Victorian music
hall and slapstick comedy helped him understand
the play and increased his admiration for it.

Sinee‘l‘rejo ﬁrst found a tam for Cadet, he has
come to deeply respect playwright Samuel Beckett’s
works particularly Wiringﬂir Sadat. Treja said that
part oihis attraction to the piece comes from his
sympathy with what he believes Beckett’s message
is. “I think in the play there's this idea that things
are really bad in the world," said Treio. "You have

”It's not everybodys
cup of tea, but at the
same time it’ s
entertaining and I
think a lot of people
haven't seen it in a
way that brings out
the humor.” .

Gardiner. “you have to ﬁgure out a my to inc
ruse [the silence] with energy. But at the same
time you want to evoke that same feeling cfdis-
comfort. frustration and anxiety that comes along
with along pause." That discomfort ﬁles at the
audience in many orthe play's anrielimaeric mo—
ments. such as a long, stiﬂing gap herween the
end or a magniﬁcent monologue delivered by
P0120 and the next line.

Despite thestigma sometimes associated with

'tl‘e absurdity of the play, Trcjo, wainright and

Gardiner are conﬁdent that the audience will ap-
preciate its various facets “[Cnda/ is] really po-
etry in theatre," said Wainlight. “It tries to true
body so many dirrerent facets orerisrence as w:

Gardiner also thinks that many people will
enjoy the play “its not everyhody's cup ortea,"
he said, “but at the same time
it is entertaining and I think a
lot or people havent seen it
done in a way that brings out
the humor.

Treio thinks that showing
the play here will help promote
the production or Becketts
plays in general. He said that
he would like to see more di.
rectors work on pieces by
Beckett hecause “I think his
plays are very understandable.
You just have to see them done
and they aren‘t done as much

as they should be."
