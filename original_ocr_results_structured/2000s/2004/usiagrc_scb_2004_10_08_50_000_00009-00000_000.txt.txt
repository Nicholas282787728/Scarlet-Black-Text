MONDAY, OCT. IS
Oddbar Quartet
A Fungus AmangUS

What better day forjust relaxing with your

friends then the fourth day of break? You travel
Friday, have fun Saturday, recuperate Sunday, then
just hang with people for awhile. I ask, what music
is better for hanging around and relaxing than jazz?
For this i recommend, A Fungus AmongL/S from the
Oddbar Quartet. The CD opens with a hip hop track,
"A Fungus AmongUS,” that has scratching and rap
over the top of the jazz quartet, a bass, guitar and
trumpet. The Song drives hard through the melody
and an excellent guitar solo. The CD continues in
this upbeat vein throughout. irack four, "Parametr
ric Equations,” opens with an amazing bass solo on
an extended acoustic bass. The song descends to
chaotic points twice before bouncing back into the
melody. The closing track, ”Unconstitutional Blues,"
a more standard blues song, ends the CD on the
same upbeat vein it began with.

It’s two weeks until the election that, like the pill, needs

returnsiBen Kwellei’s ”Jerry Falwell Destroyed Earth" comes

close—it does have soft songs afﬁrming your right to free

Like any album, a few songs suck—I'm looking at you

Blink-182—but A Future Soundtrackfm Anien’ca is for a good

The Postal Service
Give Up
Sub Pop Records 2002

Driving back to Grinnell will be a let down for me.
After having seen a special someone in New Jersey
and then being in my sisters wedding, I’m gonna need
mellow, contemplative and somewhat lieartcwrenchc
ing tunes for the ride to fit my gloomy mood. Give Up
by The Postal Service is Benjamin Gibbard and Jimmy
Tamborello of Death Cab for Cutie. The electronipop
keyboard/guitar combinations, melodic vocals and
simple but pleasant rhythmic lines might help you chill
out a bit—just ignore the words if you don't feel like
listening to “depressing music.” But you’ll be missing
out—Gibbard applies fresh language and metaphors to
hum-drum cliches such as lost love, loneliness and the
state of the world. A few examples: "I am ﬁnally seeing
why I was the one worth leaving" ("The District Sleeps
Alone Tonight"): "What does it take to get a drink in
this place?” ("This Place Is a Pn'son"). Ijust might need
a drink after getting off of 1-80 at exit 132.

The Black Album
Rocafella 2003
After being on top of the
rap game for the better part of eight years, Jay—Z
ends his charttopping career with one of the
greatest LPs in hiphop history, The Black Album.
Loaded with nostalgic rhymes, smooth beats and
top-notch production, The Black Album will cerc
tainly get you through your long ride back home,
The primary theme of the album, breaking ties

 

Sigur Ros
( )

MCA Records 2002
The sonic textures and ambient beauty of Sigur Rus’
() make it my mellow, ﬁrst—Sunday-of-break soundtrack.
Though all of the album's tracks lack titles, the music is
full of grand Soundscapes and intricate instrumentations.

 

with what has deﬁned life’s greatness thus far,
is fitting for any student trying to construct a
positive reality of high school life that, let's be
honest, sucked. The positive nostalgia theme is ‘
best expressed on "Encore" and ”AllurE,” pro-
duced by hip-hop giants Kanye West and Pharrell
respectively.

 

 

Sung entirely in "Hopelandic," a madesup language based
on the band's native Icelandic, the album has a haunting,
almost spiritual quality to it. Sigur Ros relies heavily on the
alternation of soaring vocals, bowed guitar and symphonic
washes to create an album that fits together amazingly as
a whole. While nearly all of the album is enjoyable, “Un-
titled 4" and "Untitled 8" blend the conceptual elements
and compelling melodic lines with brilliant effect. Great for
an afternoon ofjust lying on a bed and daydreaming, {} is
perfect music for a mellow Sunday.

Rilo Kiley
More Adventurous
Brute/Beaule Record 2004

Rilo Kiley's third album, More Adventurous, has
already gotten me through a month of WedneSc
days, and if you’re ready to come back to school,
it’s the perfect thing to listen to. It sounds kind
of like the friends you haven’t seen for a whole
five days. It’s full of manic-depressive hopeless
romanticism, swinging between the polar extremes
of "I am flawed if I'm not free" and "Maybe ours
is the cause of all mankind. Get loved make more,
try to stay alive.” Then there’s strangely intelligent
social commentary: ”We’re just recreation for all
these doctors and lawyers." And then there's the
line that reminds me of Harris parties, ”The talking
leads to touching, and the touching leads to sex,
and then there is no mystery left." Hints of old
school country, Queencstyle rock, electric pop, and
big orchestra bombast blend into one warm fuzzy
ideologically diverse community of sounds. So in
case you’d forgotten what college life was like, or
wanted to, kilo Kiley’s part-ironic part-dead seri—
ous sound will be happy to quietly remind you, for
better or for best,

Cranberries
No Need To Argue
island Records 1994

Back at school, but not quite. It's the last Saturday
before fall break ends and, although you did kind of miss
that one kid on your floor who likes to blast Nelly at 3
am. after Harris is done and forgotten, you would prefer
to bask in the silence and remember home. Relive the
beginning of adolescence with The Cranberries’ sophomore
effort, No Need To Argue. You’ll have fun with definitive
middle school classics like “Ode To My Family," "Can't Be
With You," and, of course, "Zombie," underscored by clean,
mesmerizing guitars and Dolores O’Riordan’s haunting
voice. Though things have changed since then, like the
crack in your voice and the fact that the band broke up,
that shouldn’t stop you from trying to imitate Dolores's
wailing. It sounds even better in an empty loggia.

Cold Duck Complex
Live
2003

On the second day home for fall break, nothing can con-
sol or bolster the hazy "I have no idea whatI did last night
or where I am, but it’s a Saturday, so I'm going to keep
going" state of mind quite like a vulgarjazz-funk/hip-hop
song to the beat of the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air theme song.
That is why as I’m dn'ving home at 2 p.m., just after I wake
up, I'm going to listen to the Cold Duck Complex Live 2003
album that I downloaded for free off their website. Cold
Duck is one of the best hiprhop groups with alive band that
I've heard. Makaya, Joe C. and Jeff D. are the sickest musi
cians around and Platypus Complex, their M.C., has haidrhitr
ting, political rhymes and mind-blowing skills on the mike.
with their improvisation-based music, Cold Duck sets new
standards for both live and recorded hiprhop.

THURSDAY, OCT. 2]

The Police
Live!

Thursday always seems to be the lull day in the week,
right before the final weekend of Fall Break franticness.
For a lull day you need a decidedly non-lull CD. Yeah, the
Police broke up before half of the current student body
was born, but everyone remembers their songs. Go back
and pick up this sprawling doubledisc and remind yourself
how bloody exciting pop can he sometimes, not to men-
tion how bloody talented Sting, Stewart Copeland and
Andy Summers all were back then, Disc 1 is an old-school,
lo—fi dip into the group’s frenetic, borderline punk roots
with a 1979 concert, Disc 2 is from the Synchronicity
Tour, which is about as synchronized as it can get, hitting
you with a breakneck collection of one fantastic song
after another, enhanced with the raw energy only a live

_ show can give. This music has withstood the test of time.

See for yourself.

Monkey bowl FRIDAY, OCT. 22

Plastic 350
Inrinixy Cat Recordings 2004
The New Yorker describes the band Monkey Bowl as
“a cross between the Fugs and Ali 6.” All you need to
know is that the band's CD, Plostlc 350, is 3 light
hearted, wonderfully sarcastic collection of music. If
you need one reason to buy Plastic 350, then buy it
for "Al Gore," Monkey Bowl’s tribute
to the vice president. Beyond having
an amusing cameo appearance, it
also happens to be a wellrwritten and
funny song with a catchy melody.
But there’re more reasons than
one song to buy Plastic 350, Listen-
ing to Monkey Bowl, you’ll notice
wry sarcasm and melody—driven tunes. whether lead
singer Bob Something is pining in the style of a
pop love ballad or drawling ribald lyrics in "Hip Hop
Bunny,” you can both hum and laugh while you put
off packing.
