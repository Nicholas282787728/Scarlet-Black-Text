Goals were hard to find last weekend in VViston—
sin as two more solid defensive crtotts by the Gtinnell
College men's soccer team went unrcwlu'dt‘d. Playing
on the road, Gtinnell hold conference foes Ripon and
Carroll to two goals apiccc, htrt carnc try on thc short
end in both games.

Last Saturday, the Pioneers all 271 at Ripon dcs

the Red Hawks. First—year staitci
Ben scltiaegei opened the scoring
In the «ﬁst minute, and the Pioneers
took a 170 lead into halftime. Not
to he denied, Ripon scnior Tommy
Becker recorded his 17th and 18th
goals of the season in the 56th and

the hosts.

“We had them down and we
didn't do enough to put the game
away when we could have," said
ﬁrstrycar coach Brian iaworski.

“Vi/e lost 271 but that game could have been 772
in our favor,” said midﬁelder Gideon Erkcnswick ‘06,
echoing Jawoiski’s frustration.

One highlight, Etkcnswick said, was the contin-
ucd support or Grhtrtcll stair rncrnhei- Lyle Badman.

“I thought 1 was dreaming this Weekend whcrt we
went out to the Ripon ﬁcid,a 7 hour drive from Grins
nail, and there Sitting on the bleachers was Lylc Bails
man with his whole family waiting to cheer as on," he
said. “I can’t even desciibe the type of difference that
kind ofsupport makes in our play."

"Although we may not
end up with a record
as good as past seas
sons, I think we are
actaully playing the
83rd minutes to seem: victory {or game better than we
ever have before."

“We scared the crap out of them in the first half,"
Erkenswiclt continued, "I don’t think they expected
its to play like we did,which was bt‘ttcr than thcrn (or
those first 45 minutes."

Two goals cat-1y in thc sccond hall'spoilcd a strong

The losses dropped the team to
+9 overall, 26 in conference plliy,
but the Pioneers feel its record is
not indicative of the progress they
have made this season.

“The guys on this team did a lot
ofwork in laying a ncw foundation
for the program and I am grattrtil
for their honest, hard work all sea~
son,” said ratiroisla. “One, five, ten
years from now, our seniors and all

back to campus and hayc senior
thing they know they rebuilt and I think that will be
a great feeling for all of them."

Erkcnswick spokc highly of the transformation
enacted byJaivorslti in his first season as head coach.

“This is my third season with the Grinncll men's
soccer tcarn,"said Erkcnswick, “and although we may
not and up with a record as good as past seasons, I
think we are actually playing the game better than we
ever have before."

Without a berth in the conference touinament,
the men conclude their season at Illinois College (2-
11, 1-7) this Saturday. Jaworsiti, as always, expects
quality play from his tcatrt.

“1 cxpcct us to play our hcst sncccr,“ the head
coach said.
