While an audience looked on, Rahmaan Statilt brought
a race to life with quick, sweeping passes ora spray can.
with a forgotten crowd behind him and three vast pieces
of plywood in front ofhim he began his work. A patch of
brown quickly became a nose and two eyes emerged from
a pair of yellow streaks, rausing to change cans, Sratik
seemed to suddenly recall his specrarors and he slowly
turned to speak.

statik was addressing the crowd of approximately 40
Grinnell students and visitors who attended a grafﬁti work
shop last Wednesday The workshop, a pan of this week’s
hipehop festival, was designed to promote awareness about
gramti art, one of the four elements ofhip.hop culture.

Ned levy ’04 and Derek chandler ‘04, the primary
organizers ofthe Hip Hop Festival said that the main goal
of the graffiti workshop to Grinnell Wu to teach people
here about the true nature of grafﬁti art. “These things
have a history that is worth knowing,“ said levy, “it is a
cultural phenomenon worth looking into." Chandler hips.
lighted the equalityorthe rour elemenrs orhiphop. “Graf-
hri is just as important as the other aspects thip-hop,"l1e
said, “lfyou exclude one, you're doing a tremendous disc
service to the culture."

The workshop featured Rahmaan Statik, Max Sensing
and Zeek Ctowe, the three founding membets of the RK
Design, a well-known Chicago based graihti crew.

Organizations frequently commission the crew for
murals that can cost up to $16,000. Their current project
will be unveiled and presented to Grinnell College today
at 4:15 pm.

cance ofgrarfiti art, statik described gramti as “ a modern
art movement, a network and a scene of its own," After
the introduction. statik led a doeminure question and ant
swersession that covered everything from the different
ofcaps for cans ofspray paint ro the cones orgraehti on
the street. The workshop ended with a preview orthernural
in progress behind the ﬁne arts building

listatik seemed slightlyseli—eonseious before his audi-
ence in she North Lounge, it was all left behind once he
was in fronrofrhe muml, with aean in his hand and the
plywood in from ofhim, he was home. He danced back
and forth in front orrhe mural, looking at his work from
dirrerenr anglo and adding lines to the wood in what
seemed to bean arbitrary manner uneil an imagewas maxed
from the surface. As he described the diiierent processes
involved in creating a gtaihti mural, such as the oil painlr
ing technique of layering from dark ro light, it was hard
not to see his passion for the medium.

As starik worked, students had a chance to talk to rhe
members of rhe RK Design. Crowe spoke to a tow stu.
dents about a distinction made earlier in the workshop
about the dirrerenees between gmiiiri an and gang grarfni.
While mg grafﬁti is usually iusr an individuals name or
gang symbol on a wall, murals involve the community.

This philosophy is reﬂected in the uplirring murals cre.
ated by RK Design that can be round in many orthe im—
poverished neighborhoods in Chicago. Crowe said it
was “important these murals have positive messages that
the community can relate to." He also described the sense
ofuniry and culture that could he expressed through graf»
fiti murals. “You can't paint for yourself, you have to paint
for the people."

The organisers ofGrinnell's week—long Hip Hop Fes»
rival hope to pack Harris Friday night for a concert femur»
ing three uprand—cnming groups:The Usuall Suspeclz, 50/
so and TeWes.

The Usuall Suspccu, who played here last semester.
are a nativc Chimgo band that got together in 2001 and
released their ﬁrst album, U; m Tim”, soon after. The band
is made up of seven artist/producers who call themselves
Vizion, Trigga Trife, Ready, Qhazi, Nes, Kurse and
Mastamynde. Ned levy ’04 knew some of rhe members
and thought they would make an excellent addition to
the Friday-night lineup. The band deﬁes attempts to place
it in a predeﬁned category within tap, and instead the
members all themselves “street poem." (1: v5 Tim has
received radio play in Chimgo. The group also worked
with the duo Spike N Jamahl to produce US or Bobby
Dmlze Univeniry Mixtape.

The other two bands performing 50/50 and T-Wcs,
ate horh from Kansas City. Isom Winston ‘04's aunt man-
ages rhe groups and the committee decided the festival
was a good opportunity to give the groups some exposure.
50/50 has come out with several songs including Hum»
blngzv Hill and Somethingdmrmg/o. some ofrheir lyrics
deal with common topio, like getring burned by a lover.
T»Wes has an album out called up Close MPmon/IJ.

Festival organizer Derrek Chandler ‘04 thinks that hav-
ing the bands perform here is mutually beneﬁcial ior the
artists and the college. The bands are all new and there
fore Within the eomminees price range and rhebands could
use the experience. “Helping artists out was very impor.
