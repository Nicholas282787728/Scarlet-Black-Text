Burton’s laresr quasismastcrpiecc. The lead eharaerer, Edward Bloom is,
like rhe ride, a lie. As an old man (played hyAlherr rinney), he rells rons of
rail raies ahour himselfas a young man (played by Ewan MeGregor), like
rhe rime meers a gianr, or is saved ar war by Siamese twin spies. Mosr of
rhe masrerfnl sroryreilers yarns revolve around his devorion ro his doring
wife Sandra (young version Alison Lohman. older Jessica Langel One
person, in addition ro some audienee memhers, doesn’r like Ed’s srories:

his son Will (Billy Ctudup). As Edward lin on his deathbed, Will seeks to

figure our yusr whar really happened in his fadrers life.
K: Billy somehow manages ro eome off all gung-ho
like he was erusading for rrurh, rhe whole truth and noth-
ing our rhe rrurh, His dad's srories are all ahour his Father’s
grand deeds, whieh is selfserving in some sense. And lo:

it’s avery sweer family movieizll Ewan Mecregor's mov—

B: Amen. But if it doesn’r sausiy you complctcly, go

Kill Bill Vol. 1 (R)

B: Irever a movie didn'r need a plor summariou, it’s
KillBill The ride gives it away, Bur, ifever a eollege didn'r
need longovinded movie reviews, ir would he crinnell,
wirh irs all around hesrness and lireraresrudenuwho could

just log on to rorreuromaroeseorn. so, for preservaiiun of .

my redundancy, I’ll eonnnue, uma Thurman is due Bride,
Bill (David Carradine) killed the resr oirhe wedding parry
so now Uma will kill Bill and his posse, The (yes, say ir
wirh me) Deadly Viper Assassinarion Squad. in volume
one, she rakes on a hlaek homemaker (Vivioa A. Fox) and
aTokyo gang lord (Lucy Liu).

Basimlly, she kills many people, but wrirer/direeror

K: us nor rhar naivel This is a musr—see. not just be-
cause everyone is ralking about it. Taranrino doesn’t heed
rhe Ameriean definirion of rhe highbrow movie, but ctr»
rainly he did a fanrasrie job in paying homage ro rhe kind
ororienral euh movie rhar fmeinared him hook in rhose
early days he had ro work in a video srore. This movie is
grear heeause when an Asian like me warehed it, I don’r
feel my eulrure heing slanred and disrored to earer for the

rasre ofAmerioan rhearer goers. KillBr‘ll is nor an exotic arrifaer displayed

for rhe sheer purpose ofouirural awareness , it’s anAmeriean movie made
