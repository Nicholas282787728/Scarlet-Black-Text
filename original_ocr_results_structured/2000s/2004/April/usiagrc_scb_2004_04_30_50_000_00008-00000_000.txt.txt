Pella: going Dutch

Visit a little piece of Holland in Iowa next weekend at Tulip Time and discover the wonders of Dutch food

by Eva Constantaras

When Grinnellians drive an hour in Search ofan international
refuge in the midst of the American Midwest, Holland isn’t the
firsr counrry rhar usually comes ro mind. But srudenrs should
rrade in their sarnosas and bruscherri for Durch lerrers and bolo-
gna the weekend of May 6 ro s ro parrake in she 69th annual
Pella Tulip Time Festival. Besides good food, the festival will fear
rure Dureh folk dancing, Tulip Queen Coronarion and bear of
all, srreer scrubbing:

. Alrhough an afrernoon spenr in a normally quiet lowa rown
may nor be the Grinnellian definirion ofa good rime, Pella isn'r a
rypical Midwesrern rown. Rather, ir's a charming New World
Dutch village, down ro rhe Iasr lace currain, poinred clog and
nodding rulip. .

Every year, rhe citizens of Pella don rheir clogs and Dutch
duds, bust out their Dutch dance moves, roll up their sleeves to
scrub rhose brick-laid srreers and parade around rown ro celebrate
rhe blooming of tulips, the ﬁrst sign of
long daysand warmcrnighrsThey'vegor
sausage, vegerable and mear markers,
food stalls that serve fries with maycn»
naise (acrually a good rhing), as well as
crafr shows, games and all rhe Dutch
rrappings rhar one would never exprcr
to see outside of Lissc.

The girls oflasrweek’s Maichite re
view made the rrek ro Pella ro preview
rhe fesrival wirh rhree primary goals in
mind: scoring some Pena bologna ar
Ulrich Mear Marker, gorging on Durch
chocolare ar shocpwinkcl’s candy store
and wirnessing rhe rown‘s gianr glockenspiel as irs carved ﬁgures
do their dance every half hour. That’s right: we were in it for
mear, candy and freakish figures.

We went in knowing all about the history ofPella, founded in
1847 by Dominie H.l>. scholre and his 800 Durch buddies. The
cown didn’t have rhe charm of coday unril rhe citizens of Fella
began a bcaurlficarion projecr in thel960s, jazzing up Fella to
look like an authentic Dutch village. The name ofrhe town means
"saferhaven” and we, in our overrworked stare, went to indulge
ourselves, pushing rhe hisrory and culrure ro rhe backofour minds.

Apparrnrly Pella is nor known for irs nighrlife, or irs lare af-
rornoon life. because once we rolled in at about five on a Friday
afternoon, half the town was shut down. That left mostly the
hisrory, culrure and personaliry ofrhe rown for us in enjoy on a
leisurely walk in rhe sunser. We encounrered rhe fields of rulips

House and Gardens is the hot-

so once we were our ofour cynical, haldvmclmpress Grinnell

Nibbling on her Dutch lerrer, Erin profoundly commenred,
“I rhink ifl lived here I'd be like happy or something." To avoid
degenerating inro a sappy nosraigia rrip, (Erin and I borh spenr a

Bolstered by our sugar rush, we wandered pasr closed srorea

cosrumes fearured in rhe Window displays. We heard the
lqokkenspel play and ran shouring in rhe direcrion ofrhe sound,
rrying ro carch sighr ofrhe ﬁgures. It rurns our we were running
rhe wrong way. The famed Kioidrenspei is acrually a bunch of
bells ar rhe rop ofa really rail building and we never did see rhe
eighr fourcfcot figures depicring rhe hisrory of Fella. So we «bane
doned our creepy fascinarion wirh rhe l<lokenspel and headed for
rhe rulips.

The scholre House and Gardens, locared on rhe edge of rhe
rown square, originally belonged ro rhe founders ofPella and now
provides a place for rourisrs and locals ro srop and smell rhe, um.
rulips. We were sold on rhe place before we even ser foor in rhe
gardens because ar rhe enrrance ofrhe garden is rhe horresr grandpa
name—well, maybe rhe only hor grandpa srarue ever made. Plus,
we gor ro climb on him. The Gardener is a lifeesize srarue of an
elderly Dutch man in gardener garb chilling our on his bicycle.

Next, we srrolled leisurely inro rhe garden itself. This garden
rivals rhe garden in Notting Hill for irs secluded. cozy beaury. The
meandering parh wound among near rulip beds, each labeled with
irs name, none ofwhich i remember, well except “cum Laude."

We proceeded obedienrly down rhe parh and in rhe cenrer of

while her daughrer peaked around rhe hack of her dress. And
while rhis sraroe ﬁrst elirired a, “Doesn’t she have enough rulips

By rhis rime, rhe lighr was fading fasr and rhe srreers of Pella
were becoming descrred. We rerurned ro rhe car, hurrying a little
