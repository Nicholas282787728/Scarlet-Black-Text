On Monday ar noon approximately
100 Students garhered no smoke in from or
rhe Nollen House in prorcsrorrhe proposed

nounced it at ’I‘itular Head.

Vice-President for Student Aﬂ'aits'l'om
Ciady arrended die proresr. He discouraged
the demonstrators from entering the Nollen
House and discussed their concerns. “I
rhink irs hue ro proe

priarc to preresr,"
Crady said. “\Vc’d like
ro have an open panel
about this and talk to
people."

Many proresrers
reacred skeprically ro
ci-ady's suggesrion.
Adam Schwartz,

addressed the assema

srai-red acring by presence," schwai-o said.
“It's much easier to ignore 500 emails than
it is 500 srudenrs in your omce or ounide
your oFi'lce building. The idea is that we do
something rhar is impossible to jusr dise
miss."

ciady said rhar rhe pi-oresreis’ reacrion
was nor surprising. “When in or a proresr,
which I have been many times before,
people seem skeprical abour wharcver we
say,“ Crady said. “in a siruarion like rliis,
why would we not try ro have an open dis

Many demonsrrarors expressed con.
eerns rhar a smoking ban imposed by rhe
adminisriarion would be in conﬂict wirh
rhe policy ofselrgovernance. “The whole
rhing wirh rhis is Lhat rhey didn’t ralk ro
us,” said non-smoker GinaTarullo ‘06. “It’s
roraily undermining Self-governance,"

”Even ifl'm nor addicted ro robacco,l
minkorher people should be allowed ro he,"
said Hannah Phelps ‘04,

From rhe megae

rhe proresr was nor
solely abour rlie po.
renrial smoking ban
“This is just one site

abled us ro gcr roe

iilryand srudenrs,” he said,

Cassie Donnelly ‘06, who cieared some
or rlie signs announcing the pi-oresr, also
perceives rlie smoking ban as air issue or
self—governance. “I see rliar rhere is a big
problem riglir now with selfegovernancc
and wirh the sermon orselregovernanee,"
Donneilysaid. “The goal [orrhe proresrl is
ro ciilrivare an environmenr in which diae

“Even il’ir is iior so, we have only ever
been given rlie impression rliar rhe admin-

isrmrion . ,. solicits inpur, opinions and gen-
eral discourse only to give rhe illusion rhar
srudenrs have a voice,” said Schwariz.

Crady does nor see rhe smoking ban as
a clear—cur issue orselrgovernance. “Many
srudenrs are making rhe argumenr rhar
smoking is a healrh and safety issue bmusc
ir altecrs rheir health," crady said, “You
cannor dispure rhe srudies rliar are our rhere

Crady recalls orher marrers concerning

Remembering
Pam Ferguson

Family, faculty, administrators and students
reﬂect on the generous contributions of former
college president and mathematics professor

by Amanda Davis

When Pam Ferguson came to Grinnell in I991, the football team was
a disasrer. ir was too small. As her husband Roger Ferguson said, “it ms
almosr dangerous to be a player,”

Ferguson told rhe direeror oradrnissions rhar she wanred ro build up
rlie ream. She didn't care wherlier rhey won or losr, Roger said, “she .usr
wanrcd asquad wirJi enough players so diar rliey wouldn’r be purring their
lives ar risk." She asked for 20 or so more players for rhe next year's ream.
When only six were added, she Found a new director oiadmissionse

Such tenacious. focused decisions soon became hallmarks ofFetguson's
leadership. “It was very clear rhar she hir rhe ground running.” said George
Drake, currenr hisrory professor and Ferguson’s predecessor as President.
“She was an eirecrive, srreng presidenr righr from die beginning."

Ferguson's tenacirywasn’t lirnired ro her performance as criiineus ﬁrst
woman president She battled cancer on and orrror 21 yeais, before dying
lasr sarurday ar rhe age oroo. In rhe years arrer she srepped down as Presi-
dent in 1997. she continued to teach in the math department and to
travel, despite the diﬁiculties caused by the disease and her treatments,

Generosity

As borh President ofthecollegeand pmfesmrofmathematics, Ferguson
highly valued her relationship: \vith Emily and smdents. “She was defie
nirely a presidenr orrhe raqury and (or rhe srudenrs," Roger said. “Those
were really the constituents that she believed in and tried to serve."

As Presidenr, she was especially
dcdieared ro arrending campus
events, said Charlie Duke, Phys-
ics. “Whenever she was in town,
she was ar an evenr almosr every
niglir. I couldn’t keep up wirh her,”
he sad “It was clear she really liked
to be with studenu and took the
time to do it."

Students and co-workcrs Said
rhar she generously shared her
time, experiences and even her
money far beyond whar rhey expected. Paul Fasquai ‘01 recalled her en»
rhusissm tor and generous hiridingorsrudcnr endeavors, including a cross
eounrry ream ska band named weasel 97. The band was “by no means
good," Faseuesi said. “They had no hope really" But when one or in
members came into her ofﬁce and serenaded her. she has so charmed that
she gave rhern money in pur our a CD.

Other students recall times when Ferguson went out of her way to
supporr rhein cmorionally. When senior Felicia barriga’s morher was ill
with mncer, Ferguson asked Barrip ro come ro her once and ralked abour
her own experience with cancerr “She was so honesr sharing her experi»
enee and her pain wirh me. She was so supporrive because she knew how
hard ir was for me ro wareh my mother die slowly over two years orrigiir.
ing againsr rhe disease," Barriga said. “I will be forever grarerul {or rhar
rime she ralked ro me. She didn’t have ro share somerhing personal like do
details other disease. Yet, she didn't care to seem vulnerable, shejust wanted
ro give me supporr and a lirrle bir orhope cven rhough I was, in a way, a
stranger "

Members orrhe raculry have similar experiences or Ferguson's genei»
osiry. even when rheir diﬂiculties were conipernrively sinall. During her
firsr semesrer ofreacliing, Karen Sliuman, Marheinerics, rold Ferguson,
rhen her hciilry nienror, rliar she was worried abour not getting any m<
Sﬁarcll done. “She said, ‘Let’s go to lunch and talk about it? We sat For an
hour and talked about diffeicnt strategies," Shuman said, She desctibed
Ferguson as honesr bur reassuring. “She rook rne veryseriously even rhough
in the big scheme orrhings, it wasn'r a very big problem."

From whir Siniman saw, Ferguson rreared lier srudenrs die same way.
“she would sir and work rh rough a problem unril ir was berrer," Shunun
said. “She didn‘t rry ro solve rhem all, butshe iiisr really cared abour people
who weie snuggling enough rheir oivn rliings,"

Ferguson, com. on p. 9

"She would sit and work
through a problem until
it was better."
