A word on make believe

Paraphrasing die dierionary, ranrasizing is rbe free play orerearive

From analyzing fantasies as rbongk rliey are real
evenrs. Fanrasies are a dilierenr animal rban rear
iry . and so daey need a new ser orerireria from
wbieb ro iudge iiiem as good or bad, I propose a
very simple rule, rrom wliieli we ean exrrapolare
more. Jusr ask yourself: does imagining dais rum
you on, do norliing ro you or rurn you om Em-
pbasis on rlre word "you."

Everyone will ranrasiae abour an enormous
range or rliings. some or your ranrasies end up
being eesrarieally arousing and exeiring and al.

go rlirougb your mind make you feel all kinds of
badness . sliaine, anger, guilr, sadness—maybe all or die above. Fan-
rasies rliar inspire rkese reelings are orren suppressed, denied, avoided
