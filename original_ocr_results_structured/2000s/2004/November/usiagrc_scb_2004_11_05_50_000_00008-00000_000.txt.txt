Election Day

9:45 a.ml, Tuesday

Cars began lining up along Eighth
Avenue, windows painted with party
slogans and presidential posters,
ready to transport students to the
polls.

10:30 a.m,

Poweshiek County’s Ward One
precinct, Fain/law Elementary,
opened at 7 a.m. with all other Iowa
polls, and by 10:30 a.m. had already
processed over 250 voters. The en-
tryway was crowded with registered
voters ounched closely together,
trying to avoid extending the line
outside into the chilly November air.
A hectic buzz of excitement hung in
the air, and the atmosphere seemed
rather friendly and comfortable.
Election ofﬁcials and poll watchs
ers maintained a serious demeanor
as they worked out their system of
recording each voter.

11 am

According to Jeff Garland, a Grin~
hell attorney who served as an elec-
tion legal observer, the entire day
moved smoothly with little or no
problems aside from the occasional
unregistered voter. ”We’re trying
to get people moving through Our
number one goal is to get people
to vote,” he said as the line wait
jumped from ﬁve to 20 minutes with
a surge of community members and
students.

Even as early as 11 aJn, on a 14‘
hour voting day, several of the poll
watchers and election ofﬁcials Corns
