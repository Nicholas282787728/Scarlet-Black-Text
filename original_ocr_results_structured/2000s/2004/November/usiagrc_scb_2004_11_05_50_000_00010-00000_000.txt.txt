Mean Girls (PG- 13)

Mean Girl: would be just another
teen comedy ifitweren’t for Tina Fey’s
witty writing and some very funny
character parts. The film is like many
others of its genrerra commentary on
the high school social hierarchy and its
effect on the losers at the bottom of the
ladder.

Cady (Lindsay Lohan) is transt
planted from Africa, where she has
spent most of her life, to a typical sub-
urban high school wrought with cliques
and drama. After a period ofeat'lng her
lunch alone in the bathroom stall,]anis,
(Lizzy caplan), rhe token goth kid and
her equally quickwitted ay t’riend,
Damian (Daniel Franzesei befriend
Cady and vow to teach her the ins and
outs of high school.

But Cady’s innocent charm attracts
another clique’s attentionttlhe Plastics,
the group of girls everyone secretly
hates but pretends to worship. The
Plastics is headed by Regina George
(Rachel McAdams) and supplemented
by two ditzy and sclftabsorbed cronies,
played disturbingly well by Lacey Char
bert and Amanda Seyfricd. The girls
offer cady a spot in rhe Plastics and
Janis and Damian jump at the chance
for Cady to spy on their enemies. Carly

It’s a bird.
It’s a plane.
It’s a movie.
Wait no, it’s
FOUR great
movies! And
many a sad
tangled web.

soon learns, however, that “it is better

to be in the Plastics, hating life,” and-

gets sucked into the group’s twisted
mind games and petty “burn hook."

Fey's writing is, predictably, a witty
notch above such classics as Clut-
[LU and Fey herself contributes to the
film in an understated but appealing
teacher role. Other SNL vets include
Amy Poehler as Regina’s mother, who
desperately V'mnlS to be back in high
school, and Tim Meadows as the high
school principal,

Mean Girls manages to strike an
appealing balance between cynical sat-
ire and a light-hearted chick ﬂick. It is
very much a parody, at times amused by
silly teenagers and at others horriﬁed at
the hell some kids go through in high
school. For the most part, it doesn’t
take itself too seriously,

By the end, however, we are sitting
through lessons in being true to your
friends and doing the right thing and
the movie loses its sassy attitude. It's
worth seeing because Fey's writing is
fresh and fun and the characters are
very entertaining. Just plug your ears
for the parts when they try to teach you
worthwhile life lessons.

Spider-Man 2 (PG-
13)

Movie studios talk a lot about (cnlt
pole movies, the summer crowdtpleast
ers that draw audiences to this movie
and the studio's other releases. With-
out a doubt, the comic book story ofan
everyman who gets superpowers and
saves both New York City and Kirsten
Dunst while defeating a fat, evil Euro-
pean scientist would make the pole In
any studio executive’s tent rise, Esplk
cially ifit’s a sequel.

Spider-Man 2 did not disappoint
the chiefs at Sony, and itwon‘t let down
audiences, either. When we last left our
geneticallytendowed hero Peter Parker
(Tobey Maguire), he was friendless,
penniless, and hopeless, yet willing to
dawn his redrandrblue webbed rubber
suit and thwart criminals at the drop
of a pizza box. Mary Jane (Dunsr),
the love of his life, is in an off-Broad-
way play and engaged to an astronaut.
His former bcst friend Harry Osborn
(James Franco) is pissed at his alter ego
and is funding the klndil’évll, kindat
European scientist Dr. Otto Octavius
(Alfred Molina),wlio in a freak fusion-
testing accident grafts four metal arms
to his back and goes crazy, it won’t be a

carefree carnival for the ol'webslinger.
There are several things that blew
about Sfidel'—Mmi 2, though All of
Peter Parker’s peers had purrid pertor-
mauccs. Before joining this blockbuster
series, both Dunsr and Franco appeared
to have actual acting ability, but now
that’s debatable. To paraphrase most
movie critics, Kirsten Dunst: ugh. The
only explanation for Franco's hammy
dialogue was his characters excessive
underage drinking. Also, the conscious
ness, persuasiveness and ambitiousness
of Octavius’ arms are, like Spider»Man’s
“organic webshootcrs,"an unneeded res
vamp of the great fourtcolor stories.
My ranboy quibbles aside, Spider-
Mzm 2 deserves the possibly pejorative
title of Best Comic Book Movie Ever.
It wins mostly with its frenetic action
scenes displaying superpowers, but the
dialogue by Alvin Sargent and Michael
Chabon has plenty of levity and very
few groantcaliher linesThe bland mor~
als of being yourself and using power
responsibly won’t stay with the audit
ence as they exit the double doors of
Harris, but the greatness of the central
character, a superhero who’s really an
anonymous adolescent, with or without
a mask on, has staying power, It must,
because the movie’s last five minutes
sets up future tent-pole Spider-sti 3.

Two full length films and six shorter ones will be playing
throughout the month of November, educating viewers about what
it means to be Latino in America and throughout the world. Lori
Cooke ‘05, chairperson of the SGA Films committee felt there was
a need for greater cultural diversity in rhc films at Grinncll.

Melina Rivera ‘07 explained the desire ofthc Studcnt Organiza-
tion orLirinrts/os (SOL) to “promote awareness as it pertains to life
in Latin America," The two teamed up to fulfill both goals.

Cine Las Americas, rhe main source ofthc films, is a notrploflt
organization that puts together a ﬁlm festival each year with movies
from around the world that address political. social and cultural is-
sues that Latin Americans face. Rivera, who became involved with
Cine Las Americas tluling high school, screened iilms for the festit
vnls and helped ivnre grant applications.

Rivera and Cooke chose the movies based on what would at
tract and inform the most Grinnellians. Rivera said they selected the
movies based on “if they had a large attendance, were good politi-
cally and talked about social issues in Latin America." Cookc then
cut the list down to fit the budget.

“it is important for all Grinncll students to be able to see Latin
America through the eyes of all the people who make these ﬁlms,"
said Marcela Conicz‘07, a member ofSOL. “Plus, for Latin Ameri»
can Grinnellians, like me. it helps relieve honicsickncss."

The full~lcngth films will be showing on two weekends. This
weekend is Urn/1 0min Na At; a Blazilian film based on a true story
about in unregistered radio station in Belo llorizonte. It follows
four young men who live in a iavtln (shnnryrown), who broadcast
about social issues in their neighborhood, The shorts will show her
fol: other feature length films.
