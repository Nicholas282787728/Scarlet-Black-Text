Students plan
Thanksgiving potluck

BY BROOKE LANSDALE

For those worried about spending Thanks
giving Day in the computer lab on Facebook
with their sack lunch, Grinnelllans for Eco-
nomic and Social Diversity (GESD) is spon-
soring aThnnksgiving dinner in Main Lounge,
Fredo Rivera '06, of GESD said, “There's a 98
percent chance that the Thanksgiving dinner
will be great this year.” Although, he did ad-
mit this will be the first time he has cooked a
turkey.

The event began last year when GESD
“organized a Thanksgiving dinner for students
who are on campus because the dinning hall
does close Thanksgiving evening," Although
the dinning hall provides bag lunches for
students on meal plans, the group wanted to
sponsor a "nice, homey Thanksgiving,” said
Rivera. Last year about 40 students attended
the event,

While students do not have to cook to
enjoy the festivities, Fredo said, “We highly
encourage students who are attending to at
least try to cook something. It could be tapi—
oca pudding. That’s not difficult," students
will be reimbursed for the food they cook and
GESD will try to provide pots and pans for
students to use.

Student Affairs will be funding the event
and last year, professors also donated food to
the event. “If professors wish to do that this
year that would be nice as well,” said Frcdo.

The group is not overlooking minor details
in creating a familial ambiance for their feast,
either. River said oflast year's meal, “ we tried
not to use paper plates, so we could make it
feel like a real thanksgiving." He hopes this
year will be similar.

Students interested in attending the meal
should email the group account, [Gestalt
“While we do expect a certain amount ofwalk-
ins, we highly suggest that students email us
so we have some idea of how much food to
cook. Students who volunteer to cook will get
emailed information regarding how the fund-
ing will pay for the food,” said Rivera.

Lourdes Portillo shows his docu-
mentary on murders in Juarez

On Nov. 17, independent ﬁlmmaker
Lourdes Portillo scrccncd her new documelk
tary, Selim‘im Exltltwada, and answered stue
dcnr questions in the Forum South Lounge.
The film explores the brutal muidels of 400
young women in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.
The sexual violence and killings, which hrsr
appeared more than a decade ago, continue
today.

Suspects include an Egyptian national,
local gangs, drug trafﬁckers, and, to many
victims, the police. Nearly all
of the cases remain unsolved.

A lack of substantial develop-

ments in the investigations

has led to charges of govern

ment negligence, covettups,

and even direct responsibility,

but mounting pressure from

victims' groups and human

rights organizations has brought about some
recent action. After the film, the SSH asked
Portillo a few questions.

Q: Do you leap in comm with thepeople
you interwiewed in the movie, and [row are
Ibey/Iuingnnw?

A: Yes, I do. I still definitely have a re-
lationship with all of them. I have [been
back to Juarez] several times. They're doing
much better. I think that there’s more of a
big international movement to stop this, so
they feel more protected. They teel more
supported. That's wonderful because before
they felt alone.

Q: Catholic ryoihols featured prominently
in rznrmlrrmr oft/Jefilm. How did ttligion
play into the reaction: ofthe people mla'ynur
filmmaking?

A:I used the religious music in the film
[because,] for me, it was very, very important
to make a film that was like a requiem, In

Margherita Pizza

Pesto gauce, ”comatose,

orhcr words, it evokes the girls [and] who they
were in the ﬁlm, rather than focusing on their
deaths and their spectacular killings and all
that. That would be a very gory ﬁlm. I wanted
to make a film that was evocative of the sim—
plicity and the beauty and the worth ofthese
girls, so that's why it's a requiem. And the rea-
son that it's a requiem also is because Mom
is a catholic country, and 1 was brought up as
a catholic, so that is howl can do a requiem
in the Catholic way. it seems ﬁtting to me.

Q: Shah of the dry and in
rtmormrlings are uftzn Iped-IIP

dawn. Why didyau plume tn treat
the image} tbir way?

A: its a stylistic choice, rer
ally, to show chaotic and con
stant movement with camera.

That's the first partilt shows you that Juarez
is like this frantic, chaotic place. And when
you start telling the story, there are these mo.
rncnts where it goes into darkness. Everything
slows down, and the cuts come up slowly fl om
darkness into the image and the movements
are very slow. This was a decision that was
made between myself and my editor because
the information is so horrific and so holren-
dous that people cannot digest it If we went
fast, you know, like MTV style, it would be
impossible. You couldn’t digest all of that has
formation. It was a way to have the audience
go slowly with all the information and make
sense out ofit.

Q: This it it very political film, with apati-
tian unda movement behind it. How Iii/Lt :er
mmpared with tome afyaurpre’uiourfilmr?

A: Well, there was one very political film
that helped a lot, which was La: Mather: TIM

film that came out about these mothers who

wete struggling to get justice for their chilt
dreu who had been killed during the dlclﬂ'
torship in Argentina. And it was very, very
crucial in bringing that out in the world.
The same with this—«it just brings the
information out, and that's what, for me,
making some ofthese documentaries [is all
about]. I don’t just make political films; I
make other things. But for me, they're very
important because I think that our press
is not talking about the truthimaybe the
rruth as I see it, you know, as I experience
it,We need a press that's very independent,
and we need a vision that is artistic that
touches people’s hearts.

Q: In men: timer multinational magni—
Iadoma, ar orsrnthlyfactorier, have moved
into Juarez rapidly In take advantage oft/)2
cheap labor andlargr altar/giant. Haw much
have globalization updated the environment
ofrhoot and the murders?

A: I think immensely since NAFTA,
the trade agtcement between Canada, the
United states, and Mexico. It really opened
up the ﬂoodgates. Once those factories
[came] and they nced[ed] 5,000 people
[each], everyone from the South [ofMex-
ico] started coming to look for jobs. so the
infrastructure starred falling a art. It's very
recent; I'd say in the last ten 63!] 12 years,
everything fell apart.

Q: Has there always been corruption in
jtmrez?

A: There has always been corruption.
The border towns have the most corruption
because this is where the ﬁrst world meets
the third world. The discrepancies between
those two worlds are so great that there's
such a great big space for corruption.
