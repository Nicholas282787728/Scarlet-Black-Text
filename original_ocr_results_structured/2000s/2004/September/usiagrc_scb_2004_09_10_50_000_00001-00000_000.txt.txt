Assault and bur-
glary top Security
concerns so far
this year

BY BROOKE LANSDALE

In addition to the normal Security incidents cont
ccrning propped doors, noise complaints and students
locked out of their rooms, since the start ofclasses,the
college has seen two serious crimes, an assault and a
burglary resulting in the theft ofa skid loader,.

Near midnight on Thursday. Sept. 2, two students
were assaulted while walking near the John Chrystal
CenteriThe students, one male and one female' were
Verbally assaulted and then attacked by three men
claiming to bc trom out oftownt

According to Security's incident report, the stu-
dents were near the corner ofS'ixth Avenue and Broad
Street when the men drove past in a truck yelling ha-
rassing comments at the female student.

The male student responded with a hand gesture,
and they continued walking up the street. By the time
they reached the corner of Sixth and Park Street the
truck had returned and parked. Three men got out of
the truck and approached the students.

After making what stcphcn Briscoe, director of
Security, callcd “some pretty harassing comments,"
one ofthem grabbed (hC male student‘s shirt and then
his neck, According to security, the student was held
for some time, tightly cnough to leave marks on his
neck.

Eventually one of the other men was able to pull
the perpetrator off the male student and both students
were able to get away. Briscoe said both students were
pretty “upset about the incident."

Briscoe said he was unaware of the motivation of
the assailants, but that they may have been under the
inﬂuence of alcohol.This is the first assault of this
type this year, but Briscoe said similar situations in
which people in passing vehicles shout insults. throw
things, or even swcrvc off the road toward students,
will probably happen several more times this year.

Briscoe urges students to “try to gct the license
plate numbers orrvchicles“ and to quickly write down
vehicle descriptions He also advises students not to
react to the agitators in these situations but rather to
kccp walking and ignore them.

The men were driving a silver pickup truck,
thought to be a Dodge, with an extended cab and a
row of lights across the top. Security urges anyone
who sees a truck matching this description to contact
them immediately.

in the early morning hours omng 30 an attcmptr
ed thcft ofa skid loader at the Joe Rosenﬁeld Campus
Center ended m the arrest of two suspects, who now
race chargcs of burglary {or breaking into the fence
sulrounding the construction site. one ofthe suspects
also taccs drug charges, according to Briscoe.

The perpetrators,also identiﬁed as being from out
of town, rammed thcir truck into the construction site
(once, knocking it down.They also caused damage to
the skid loader while trying to start it,“w1ien we tried
to approach, they took oﬁ‘running," said Briscoe.

Security immediately called the police and both
perpetrators were apprehended. a male on the corner
at Pinrose Street and Sixteenth Avenue and a female
on Sixth Avenue,

Within the bounds of more common campus
crimes, Security is also still investigating graihti
painted on Cleveland Beach, on the evening orAug.
25, and triconragcd people to report anonymous inv
formation We talked to some people with reg lrds to
lthe incident], said Briscoe, but still believe thcrc are
some pcople out there who were involved in it."
