- “After this past weekend, we no longer
eontroi our destiny as far as winning con-
ferenee, so we need some help," said guard
Tohy Carlson ‘06.

Unbeaten until last
weekend, Grinnell lost
two key road games and
may have lost their ehanee
to host the conference
tournament for the third
time in tour yearsa The
Pioneers had to travel to
Carroll college on Jan. 23
to play an evening eonrest
against the Carroll Pine
neers in a typiral highe
reoring attair, Grianeli
ms edged'l34e129. Unr
able to execute the full»
eourt nap ro porreetion, Grinneil did not
get as many turnovers as needed, and Wm
unable to outshoot the home team. Grin-
nell then had to travel to Appleton, Wise,

"We have to protect
our house. Playing
at Darby gives us
that extra some-
thing that’s tough
to find on the road.”

—T0by Carlson ’06

the next day to play the ﬁlth-tanked
Lawrenee Vikings. Tired from travel and

again unable to generate a large :tmnunr or

turnovers, the pioneen fell to the vikings
125-1 ll.

crtnnell has taken a hit

Ecloit and cat-roll come

Grinnell hasn't lost a
