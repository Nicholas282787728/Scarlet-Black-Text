Very
Dairy

A writer compares the respective merits of
Dari Barn and Dairy Queen and proclaims
one establishment the clear winner

by Amanda Davis

lwill begin this food review as I began my last, by confessing my
parrialiry. I am nor unbiased. I am neirher fair nor balanced. IfDari
Barn were rhe Dcmocraric parry and Dairy Queen were rlre Repub-
lican parry, I’d be a srrsighr ticket Democrat. Thar said, i sincerely
believe that the evidence will show that Dari Barn is the better candi-
date.

I will also acknowledge that I received valuable input from a few
lce Cream Reviewing Colleagres (ICRCs). I was .oined not only by
Fernando (also ofﬁce-reviewing fame) buralso Shakiraand Corndog,
two other ice ((91111 aficionados

During our visir to Dari Barn, rlre lCRCs were quick to point
out that the ice cream mere tastes more like ice cream than the Dairy
Queen sorr serve. I would acrually need ro do a rasre rest to support
that conclusion, but I will acknowledge a deﬁnite diFFerence in tex-
rure benvcen rhe rwo. Anorlier aspecr ofthe Dari Barn cyclone rharl
appreciared was rhar they left a lirtle unblended ropping on, er, rop. i
do nor know irrlrar's company policy or employee whim. Eur I liked

in terms ofptice and qualiry ofservlce, the esrabllshmcnrs were
prcrry comparable. in my Experience, Dari Barn service can be slower

more, so I’m sure ir evens our in rhe end.

The biggest, and lcrsrdispurablr dllrerence berwcen rlre Da(i)r(y)s
is the variety. Dari Barn has more of both ”hot ears" and “cool treats"
to mercilesslysreal rhe comperirion‘s catchphrases. Probably rhe mosr
useful oprion for ice cream consumers is rhnr rhey can, for a slighrly
higher price, subsriiure rrozen yogurr for ice cream. Also, nobody

Grinnel ans win Fulbright Scholarship

by Ben Weyl

Aldrouglr Grinnellrans are very familiar- with post-college opportunities like dre
Peace Corps and rlre Watson Fellowship, rhc Fulbright scholarship is often noron rlrc
radar of many students, “Gtinnell College does nor have a fantastic history with the
Fulbriglrr program," Doug Curclrins ’93, Director ofSocial Commitment sard. ACr
cording to Curclrius, Grinnell only had three to five srudenrs apply and win in the
1990s. The program has gained popularrry rccenrly, though, and rbcre have been eight
winners and alternates in she last three years.

Ofthe 12 current and Former Grinnell students who applied for the Fulbright this
year, nvo won, one was picked as an alrernare and one is still awairing ofﬁcial word or
her aceeprance. Elaine Twohy '04 and Jessica schniidr ’02 each won. and Holly Maness
’04 is an alrernare. Georgia Hart ‘04 has learned unofﬁcially rlrar she is n Fulbrrghr
recipient, bur has yer ro recrlve her ofﬁcial lerrer.

Fulbright grants are made to U.S. citizens and nationals of other countries for
several types oredncariond ncriviries, such as university lecturing, advanced research,
graduate study and reaching in elementary and secondary schools
Eileen Twohy

Twohy decided to apply after a lirrle caioiing from a friend in India who is currently
in rhe Fulbright prognrm. Even sosTwol‘ly said she was not set on rhe idea lasr fall when
rhe applications were due. “Ar rlre rrnic, lapplied becauscl didn’t have any idea ofwhar
else I was going to do," Afrrr she applied, she srill was nor sirrr iFshe warned to do it,
perhaps opring instead for a less structured year,

However, her feelings soon changed, “As I read more about Korea and talked to
people room it, i realized that ir vim a perfect rhing ro do next year," Twohy said, “l'rn
really pumped." Twohy will help reach English for one year in South Korea after a
seven week rrarnrngsessron to help lrrrndjirsr lo rlre clilmi‘c. Shc Wlll rcaclr students in
middle school or high school for about 20 hours prr wrrk. Hrr rclnalnlng time will be
spent doing a Communityrelatcd acriviry or engaged in research.

Twohy has no npcrlencewirh rlie Korean language, and although none is needed
(shes reaching Englishl), she bougbr a CD and hm lisrened ro ir a link. “lr‘s rornlly
dilreienr from orhcr languages," she said But Twohy does know Spanish, and ex»
pressed cxcllcmcnl about cxpcrlcnclng the new language.

Twohy is looking forward to spending time wrrlr rho students and said rhar work-
ing with kids is one oilicr favorite things to do. She nlso is looking Forward ro living
with a host family, “when l was in Costa Rica, l had two lrosr families and ir was rlrr
best thing about being there." she said, “it has the potential to be the best my to
experience Korea and ro ger ro know rhe people."

However, she acknowledges rlrar getting to know her students might not be easy

and rhar rlre our day will probably be do roughest, snll, she is looking forward to
reaching and said rlrar she is going to bring menus to the students so they can learn
conversational English.

Twohy encouraged students to consider rhe Fulbright program. “There’s no reason
not ro apply," she said. “Things sound presrigious and impressive unril you get (l1:m,"
She also warns srudenis to know rliar u is probably easier ro get rhe reaching asslsramr
ship (her program) rlran rhc research grant (Harr’s program).

Georgia Hart

Han applied for a Fulbright scholarship because she “was looking for a way to
combine rny inrcrrsrs in Spanish, larin America, and biology,” she said. “Ir sounded
ideal " Hart added that even if she did not win, “the process would be worth it."

Hart hopes to embark on a research mission to Kora, Ecuador where she would
srrcnd san Francisco univei-sinr for a year. raking mostly courses in applied ecology
Hart especially looks forward to hopefully getting to know new people and a new
crrlture. as well no the chance to use her Spanish. She said that the Fulbright is more
than just an academic grant, “its about Cultural interchange," she said. ‘

Her advice to current students is to apply despite the sense or inrirnidarion rhe
name Fulbright ofren carries with it. People like me dont apply because rlrey rlrink,

scholars was a good way orprcparing rorl tl re process.

Holly Maness

Mnncss was chosen ro be an alternate for a fellowship in rlre United Kingdom.
Only 18 people were chosen [0 be winners and'nlrerrrares our of the 690 that first
applied. Maness wants to do a one year Mnsrrrs program in applied rnarh and theoreti-
eal physim nr Cambridge.

Manrss knows rhar she wanrs ro srndy physics bur does not know whar subheld she
wants to cover “It would help me make a better informed decision ,u to what aspect of
physics 1 want to do,” she said. she also wanted to participate in the Fulbright program
because she never srudrcd abroad and rlroirghr the program would “expose me to people
horn dinercnr countries who would be my future colleagues.”

Like ltlarr, Maness found thin the crprrirnce or gorrrg rhrouglr the application
process woo helpful in itself, “It wrrs a good process [0 go through," she said. “I learned
skills drrorrgh the interview and the personal starcrncnr helped me focus on wlrnr I'm
looking ror and whar I warn ro do," Mdlicss encourages current snidcnrs to apply.
“Everyone should apply. You can learn so much abour yourselrnnd others."
