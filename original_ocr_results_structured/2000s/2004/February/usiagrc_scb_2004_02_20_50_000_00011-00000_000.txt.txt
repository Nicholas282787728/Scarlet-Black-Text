Makin’ itgreat? Pizza Hut vs. Pagliai’s

by Carly Schuna
l recenriy drned at both Pizza l-iur and Pagliai’s to compare
and rare each in caregories ofservicc, arnroephere, food, and gen-
eral perks and drawbacks. I first brought Alex Leach ’06 with me
to Pizza Hut, and then brought him and Betsy Root ’06 with inc
to Pagliai's rhe following week. Here are our experiences:

Pizza Hut
Service

Our server at Pizza Hut was friendly and courteous. \Y/hen
Alex and I walked rn or 8:20 pm, he approached us rrnmodrarely
and said, “Just so you folks know, we close at 9," and explained
why tabs couldu‘r he eredrred to rhe system airer 9 p.rn. We hadn't
(hECked the hours, so we were grateful to
he told our time limits,

Through the night, however, our
server seemed to grow slightly more dis-
tant. I ordered a glass of milk with the

mar rhey had no milk. The server didnt
provide any alternarrvee. or explain which

oevoragee they drd have, so i just ordered
water.

When our drinks and pizza came, the
server set rhern down wirhour eayirrg any-
thing. Though Alex claimed this was “he-
eause irhe server] was roe. cool for me," I
found it alittle impersonal. i also rhoughr
ir would have been considerare for rhe server to approach us midv
meal and ask us how everyrhrng was, but instead he approached
us midemeal and asked ifwe would mind if he vacuumed the
carpet while we are,

Atmosphere

The armospherc of Pizza Hut wae predicrahie and comfort-
ing. It was nearvalenrine'e Day when we are rhere, so red rnerallie
hearts were stuck on the walls, and roses were stationed in the
middle ofthe lunch buffet bar.

The hoothrwere comfortable and the Kablﬁ clean, but it was way
roo ooid in rhe restaurant. l was rempred ro pur my eoar on whrle we
are, and even Alex agreed that it was prerry chilly. We were eirring
immediarcly next [0 a window, so that could have hecn why.

One advantage of eating at

always tastes the same, so if
you're in the mood for a cer-

Pagliai’s
Service
The service at Pagliai's was leagues herrer than that of Pizza
Hutv our warrress seated us almost rrnrnednrely arrer we enrered.
and asked us righr away if we wanted anyrhrng to drrnk, Our
drinks were brought out less than a minute later. and then our
waitress left to allow us a few minutes to decide on our meal.
We ordered a large (14") halppepperoni/sausnge, half-cheese
double crust pizza. In addition, Betsy ordered a salad and Alex
ordered a piece ofcheese breada After the waitress rook our order,
we rasred our drinks, Alex’s Pepsi and my sierra Mist were ﬁne.
but Betsy had ordered water and said it was “nasty" and tasted

like “355.) From pace experience iagree wirh her

Betsys salad and Alexs cheese hread were delivered prompriy,

Alex already had his, “I don't know whose this is, then." We didn't

Atmosphere ,

The urrnoephere ar Pagliel's was also farsuperior to Pizza Hur's.
The booths were soft and comfy, and the sound level was a dull
roar despite the numerous kids in the restaurant. Alex said the
arrnoepherc “was very personalized," and generally more inviting
than at Pizza Hut. “The low lights make it like you're not at the
dining hall," he added.

I also liked the open kitchen ‘JE Pagliai’s, where it’s possible to
see cooks poundrng out bread dough and adding on toppings
from almosr anywhere rn rhe resrarrr-nnr, since chere’e somerhrng

Food

in a lirrle biased, because I've never really Irked rne pizza at
Paglial‘s. I don't find it very ﬂavorful, I think the crust is too chewy.
and I don‘t think there's enough tomato sauce.

Despite my eornplurne. however, rhe pizza wee hor and all of
rhe rngredienrs raered fresh. ordering rhe double rruer pizza gave
us “deceptively more food," eaid Betsy, who was ruli arrer only a
couple of piecee,

All in all, Pagliai's pizza is obviously ofheuer quality, but mine
and Alex’s more mainerreanr tastes prefer Piua l-iur,

Perks/Drawbacks

Soda refills ar Pagliai's are free. and rheservice is very quick
our przzn arrived yuer under 15 minutes after ordering.

Drawbacks rnclrrde the bathrooms having only onesrall. Betsy
also thought that the resraurenr was a little roo chilly.
