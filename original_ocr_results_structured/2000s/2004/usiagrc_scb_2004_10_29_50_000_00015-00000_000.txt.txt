Senior linebacker Charles Blake
knew that it was only a matter of time
last Snturndy before his Pioneer footr
ball team would start putting points
on the board. ltiust took a little longer
than expected.

“We just told each other to settle
down and lock them down, because we
knew that it doesn‘t take long for our
offense to ignite, es-
pecially in our house."

When it was all
said and done, the
Grinnell offense had
treated the home
crowd to another
fourth quarter come-
back, this time with
a 30—27 victory ovcr
the visiting Lawrence
Vikings.

The win follows
a 37-6 vicroty over Knox the previous
weekend that left Grinnell with .1 +3
overall rot-old, 3-3 MWC, with thiee
games remaining.

Gi-innell got on the hoard ﬁrst
thanks to a Bud Baumgartncr ‘07 28
yard field goal in the first quarter.

touchdown pass in the second quarter,
and Pioneers went into the half down
by only four points.

“We are preparing the team mcn-

Hollibttugh. “We do not have to do
thing different, we just have to tak
of the ball, stop hurting ourselves with
penalties and the defense must i‘nrcc
some mrnovcrs.To me, this game is go
ing ro come down to the team which
plays the best. Sure, St. Norbert may be
bigger, may he srronger and taster, but
we have great rcntn dynamics The best
athletes in team sports do nor always
win. It is the team which plays together
that usually wins on Saturdays.”

Women’s cross coun-
try, fresh off a win at
Dr. Tucker, is eyeing its
ﬁrst MWC title since
'95, while the men’s
team is primed to win
yet again at Conference

BY BRADLEY lvERSON'LONG

The women’s and men’s Pioneer
cross country tcrirns will descend upon
High CiirrSrare Park in Appleton,Wis.
tomorrow for the Midwest Conference
Championships. The course for the
race will be a challenge for Gi'innell,

“There are some sections ofnarrow
trails and the footing may be less than
ideal in places” said women's coach Ew
clyn Freeman.

Nevertheless, both teams are flying
high into the race.

“we’ve got a lot ofconﬁdence goe
ing into conference," said Freeman.
The women’s team won the Dr. Tucker
Invite in Dubuque on Oct. 16, with -.1
strong team score of45.

“It was outstanding," said Freeman.
“Our times were incredibly fast." Sarah
Spencer ‘08 ﬁnished first with a time
of18:39, and last week was named the
Midwest Conference Runner of the
Week.

Going into the championships, the
Grinnell women have some or the top
times in the conference, Spencer has
the fastest time this season, while Mer~
edith Groves ’08, Katie Ryan ’07, Erin
Sindewald ’08, and Lola Garcia '06 are
all in the top 10. Monmouth is the only
team to have two in the top 10. The
Pioneer women last won a conference
championship in 1995.

Meanwhile, the Grinnell men's
team has won 17 of the last 18 confer
ence championships, a streak of domi-
nance mending buck to before some of
the current Pioneers were born. They
are expected to extend their run' of sucr
cess.

“We feel pretty good about our
chances," said men’s coach Will Freer
man.

The men last ran on Oct. 9 at the ,
Dan Huston Invite, taking second place
in the 4k racelusrin Riley '06 paced the
Pioneers, ﬁnishing third with a time of
12:25.

“Our main goal is to get to (the
NCAA) Nationals," said captain Dar
vid l—lonig ’06. As part of their quest.
the team’s top nine runners will not
taper off their tiaining this week. The
next step toward that goal will be the
NCAA Rogionals in two weeks Over
all, Will Freeman said his team “has
made a commitment to the training
and 1 think it‘s going to show up this
weekend, i think- they're ready to go
