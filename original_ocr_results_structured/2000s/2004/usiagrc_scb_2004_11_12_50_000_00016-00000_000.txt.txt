For the ﬁrst me in team history, all G nnellswrmmers had
to pass a minimum requirement test to Join the varsity team.
Each swimmer had to legally swim 100 yards of all four strokes,
freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, and butterﬂy, at last
weekend's intersquad meet to make the team According to the
coaches, there were no cuts, as all swimmers who tried to join
the team made it.

Part of the reason for the new policy was the overcrowding
of the swim team in past years, "Last year we had 80 people
on the team" said coach Erin Hurley. “One of the reasons we
had so many was that there was no other option (or organized
swimming." Last season, the team had to hold two practices to
have enough pool time for all the swimmers.

"For varsity swimming, we feel that [swimmers] should be
able to do the basic skills, which is 100 (yards) of each stroke”
Hurley said. "Everybody on the team made it... Ithink we're a
tougher and stronger team."

This year’s team is also smaller, but there is another option
for Grinnellians who want organized swimming sessions with
instruction Grinnell swimmers and coaches have organized
Club Swimming, which meets ror an hour every Sunday, Tues-
day, and Thursday evening. ”Club Swimming is a good avenue
for some people that didn’t want to make the commitment from
now until February but they’ve been able to work out with a
group of students that are more serious than lap swimmers,"
Hurley Said.

Club Swimming is planning to host an allncampus swim meet
next month, open to all students, faculty, and staff members.
Anyone interested in participating in club swimming can email

The title defense for men's and women's swimming and diving
begins ronighr, as rhe Pioneers will host a dual mccr wirh Mona
mouth at 7 p.m. at Obermiller Pool in the PEC. However, Grinnell
will have more pool time this weekend. Tomorrow at noon is the
Alumni meet, which will usher in the return of dozens of Grinncll
swimming alumnir

Neither meet should worry the Pioneers, as Monmouth is fields
ing its first varsity swim team since 1982, and rhe Alumni meet is
an uthihirion of odd relays and a chance to reconnect with former
rcammarcs. “Alumni's just a really fun rimc with old friends,” said
Erinri Croco ’07.

“It’s just a well-rounded team
that I think a lot of schools in

The men's team rs srockcd wnh speed. The 200 freestyle relay
team ofBraden Pence ‘05, Gene Peterson ‘05, Erik Larson ‘06, and
Pcrer Brown '05 broke a conference record last spring. Grinneu
also returns Brett McMillan ‘05, the 200203 Midwest Conference

ing Andy Dickens, Mart Rcmissong, and Eric Thumma.

The women’s team boasts 40 members, including Croco, the den

conference champion and All-American diver Sarah Staycr ‘05, who
is studying abroad rhis semesrcr. Amanda Keledjian ‘08 swept rhc

The Pioneers title defense will not go unconrcsrcd. The main

While capturing conference titles are the teams main goal,

The Grinnell swimmers are not gluttons for
punishment, but since they crave victory, they
endure their ‘r share of pain The Pioneers
stepped up their preseason training this year with
strenuous workouts out of the pool. "The dry Land
(training)’s really tough,“ push-ups, pull—ups, sit—
ups and all that," said Kevin Wood 0% "No one
really likes that because it’s hard”

"It’s been really intense” said Allie Kossoy ’08,
”We've been doing a lot of muscle work pertains
ing to muscles we use in swimming, andit sort of
overworks your muscles"

The mastermind behind the dry land training
is new assistant coach Alex Kuhn, also a senior
consultant for Fluid Mechanics, a swim technique
program. He said that the new training isolates
swimming-speciﬁc muscles, including triceps,
quadriceps and lateral muscles,

"A lot of times for example theyll do regular
push-ups, which for a swimmer really has no benn
eﬁt," Kuhn said. "So we modify the push-ups so
their elbows are closer to their body which would
incorporate more of a swimming movement. It’s a
lot harder pushnup for them because theyve never
done push-ups like that, and it’s using a much
smaller muscle group to move their body,"

Kuhn concedes that the workouts, which also
include wall sits and using medicine balls, have
been hard. "The [exercises] are pretty tough" he
said. "The swimmers complain sometimes but they
are performing really well at them right now.”

Head coach Erin Hurley has been impressed
with the team's resolve so fat "It's been pretty
tough" Hurley said. "The swimmers have had re-
ally good attitudes and given it their best shot.

I know theyre pretty sore, but they’re going to
be really strong and very ﬁt and I think their ap—
proach has been outstanding"

Many of the swimmers are also starting to see
results from the new training. "We're working
harder than I’ve ever seen the team work before,"
said women's co—captain Kathryn Croco ’05,
”People are faster [and] had lifetime bests at the
intersquad meet after only two weeks of practice.
Ithink we have the potential to be really fast."

So while it may seem like some of the swim—
mers are participating less often in classes since
they can’t raise their arms, their participation
points will Show up in the pool this season.
