Respect

I'd like so respond re Jennirer Reeces leircr so ihe edisor in she

free housing to “grow up." She implie shar rhe push among some
rncmhcrs of she ssudenr hody for a substancefrcc dorm is so srus
dcncs can isolarc rhemsclvrs from drinking and she says ihas dunks
ing will he going on around snidcnrs “for she res ofrheir lives.”

1 dons rhink it’s fair so group all ssudenrs in favor ofsubsmncev
frss housing or even all who wanr so live rhers, es wishing so isolars
sheinselvcs from drinking. People would choose suhsiancefrec for
any numher of reasons; she moioriry ofsrudcnrs who will live rhere
next year will noi he fuseycars and consequensly came so Grinncll
despise iis lack ofsubsrancesfree housing end so should alreedy he
used so she armosphsre of drinking shas ls ofsen pressns. l helieve
shas a lor of ssudenis simply appreciase rhe addirional living oprion,
in she same way shar ssudenss who live in smokefree housing do. ln
she same vein, 1 don’t rhink shar nonsdrinkcrs condemn shose who
do drinkil just believe rhor rhcy wane and deserve a living armor
sphere which reinforces shsir own choices.

The addision ufsubsrancefrtc housing as Grinnsll will nor ISO»
lase ssudenrs who choose so live shere l douhr shes any of she non»
drinkers living rhere will complerely confine rheir friendships or in.
rerocrions ro orher nondrinkers, nor do l rhink that non-drinkers
don-s know “how ro deal" wlrh drinking, as Rccce suggesrs. Sub-
ssanceafrec housing is nor a “solurion” so any sorr ofprohlem; rs's yusr
anosher living opsion ror ssudenrs.

Lesily, Reece is only perrly righi when she seys rhss drinking will
