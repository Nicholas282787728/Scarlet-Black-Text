Clark Kopelman Y04 describes his substance
abuse eounselor as erraerly like John Goodman's
character, Walter Sobchak, in The Big Lebmwlei.

“He was from southern Iowa and he has a
Ior offamous sayings. I rold him rharI had gone
haek ro Grinnell onee during my rrenrmenr, rhar
I didn’r use [but] wenr baek ro visir my user
fri:nds, His ﬁrst remark was ‘You know Clark. no-
body goes to Lhe Wl‘iDr: house to look.‘ He mad:
me really rhink ahour my personal responsibility.”

In rhe spring semesrer or his junior year in
2002, Clark Kopelman '04 was aeoepred ro
Morrar Board, a narional eollege senior honor
soeiery devored ro seirolarship and serviee, ar rhe

Realizing rhar he had spenr a good parr of his
$16,000 rrusr aeeounr on marijuana and was
unable ro funerion wirhour being high,
Kopelman know he had ro srop.

“What srarred off being somewhar mrnrmal
usage quickly led ro everyday usage and using all
the time," said Kopclman. “It didn’t strlk: mc
unrrl larer jusr how our ofeheraerer irwas ro be
spending rm much money wirh very IirrIe eon.
rroI over whar I was doing,"

Kopelman admirs rhar marijuana abuse is nor
always rhar eommon, bur when eompounded
with his own mental health issues. it lucamc a
difﬁcult habit to break.

“I've :xpericnccd a number of people sinee
I’ve com: haek saying. ‘Well, it’s just weed. You
ean'r have a problem wirh weed.’ They should
realize rhar people have problems," said
Kopelman. “Most people don't develop sueh a
serious problem wirh por, andl rhink irwas rhe
faer rhar I had severe underlying depression, se-
vere anxiety rhar really perperuered rhe eyele and
made rr really hard ro quit."

Getting treatment

At rhe heighr of his use, Kopelman had
gained close to 50 or 40 pounds and was both
severely depressed and suicidal. “The world iusr
seemed ro be so fucking gone rhar ir was going
to come to an end, I felt in crisis. It was hard for
me ro reeogniae ar firsr rhar rhe drugs were the
leading eause of this."

After the Scmcsler ended, Kopclman talked

wirh his parenrs ro ler rhem know whrr was go» ,

ing on. He'd originally planned ro sray in Grin.
nell rhar summer and do research. But he needed
some rimeoifin order ro gain oonrrol over hrs abuse.
Kopelman decided ro quit eold rurkey, srarr a re.
hah program and rake a medial leave from Grinr
nell. Throughour his deeision process, several ade
minisrrarors were helpful and he found few battir
ers in gerrlng permission ro leave.

“I only wenr [as far as] Iowa City, bur ir was
very helpful ro ger our ofbad hahirs here," said
Kopelman, "It was defrnirely one day ar a rime,
one hour ar a rime for rhe firsr few monrhs. It
was errremely hard."

The rehab eenrer, associared wirh an Iowa
Ciry hospirnl, had borh overnighr inparrenrs and
orhers, like Kopelman, who were only rhere dur.
ing rhe day as parr of rheir parrral program.

“I spenr a few monrhs jusr being rhere all

In rhe lasr rwo years. Kopelman said he has
srrengrhened hrs relarionship wirh his family,
espeeially wirh his farher. He keeps in eonsranr
contactwith Kopelman and calls him every single

Having played rhe guirar for nearly a decade,
musie Is anorher aeriviry rhar helps him ro sray -

solurion ro all hrs problems. “It wasn'r a savior,”
Kopelman said. “It was just anorhor aeriviry."

Kopelrnan goes ro bed early every nighr and
makes sure ro sleep ar leasr eighr hours. “Ifl’m
nor resred l’m nor going ro make decisions as
well," he said. “I'm nor going ro view rhings re.
alistically.”

one ofrhe rriekiesr rhings has been learning
how ro eope with his emorions in new ways and
find healrhy ways ro deal wirh anxieries, “With-
our rhe subsranee abuse, I prerry mueh iusr have
ro dealwirh my feelings, depression and 0CD,"
said Kopelman. “It’s very rempring nor ro deal
wirh rhar. The healrhy way so deal would be ro

always rhe remprarion rharl eould iusr go ger high
and forger abour [wharever is borhering me].”

Coming back to Grinneil

Kopelman has now been substance free for
over a year and a half. He rravels ro Iowa crry

cording ro Kopelman, rhe hardesr parr has been
making rhe rransrrion from Iowa Ciry ro Grinr
nell, where he has srrong assoeiarions wirh drug
abuse.

“I’m around a lot more drugs here than I was
in Iowa City." said Kopelman. “it was hard ro
com: back and see a lor ofpeople rhar l used ro
use wirh. I dorr'r rhink ir was GrinneII per se; I
iusr have sueh srrong assoeiarions here and drugs
are so easy ro ger here."

Through loyee Stem, Kopelman has mer
with orher srudenrs who have drug abuse prob.
lems similar ro his. He ofren sees rhe same par.
terns ofabuse in orhers rhar he saw in himself.

“one ofrhe problems when l was using was
rhar I was real good ar hiding it." he said. “I was
an SA, I had a lo: ofdriferenr responsibiliries on
campus, and no one realized. I had a few friends
who knew whar was going on, bur I rhink rhey
were iusr roo-shoeked ro know whar ro do. Ir
was a big shifr in my behavior."

The higgut shrfr in Kopelman’s behavior hap.
pened jusr a few days afrer enrering rhe program.

“My subsranee abuse eounselor sar me down
and said very srrnighr—forwardly, ‘wlren are you
going to srop fuekrng around? When are you
going ro srop playing rhese games?’ At rhar point.
I hadrr'r rhorrghr of it as a game. All rlre urges
and drives I had ro use drugs were so srrong that
I didn’t reeognrze rhar rhrs was something I we
playing games wirh, rhar ir was sonrerhirrg I re

on I drd see is as somerlrrng I could eorrrrol, as a
