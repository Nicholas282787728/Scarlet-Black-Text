minute offa pass from ﬁrstrycnr starter Hannah Sayle.

Sunday's match wouldn’t he decided so early, however, as a stub-
born Lawrence defense withstood Grinnell's Bil-shot offensive bare
rage (while only recording six orrhcir own) {or the ﬁrst 90 minutes.
It was Sarah Evans ‘05, a threertime allrMidwest Conference ﬁrst
team membel,who ended the game for Grinnell (7-3,4-1 in confer-
ence play) with a penalty kick less than one minute into the over-
time session.

"The team had an incredible challenge presented to us after the
Lake Forest game," said head coach Heather Benning. “We knew
that we had the physical talent to win the matches [last] weekend,
what we needed to prove is that we had the mental resolve to come
back after such a heartbreaking loss and battle against two quality
opponents.”

Lastweekend‘s results suggested the team had more than enough
mental resolve.

“This is my 10th year as a member of the coaching start, “ said
Benmng, “and I have never worked with a group otwoinen so to-
cused, positive and understanding of the process that goes into wnls
mn .’

§Nhile St. Norbert and Lawrence field respectable women‘s
teams, the men faced an emerging national contender in St.Notbert
on Saturday followed by a physical Lawrence squad with a mislead-
ing 2—1-1 conference record (the Vikings tied Lake Forest and lost
to undefeated Carroll college in overtime) on Sunday,

St. Norbert struck early and often scoring four goals in the
opening seventeen minutes to down the hard-working Pioneers 6-

2. Firsrrycar Delncttio Rojasl scored off a pass from Jultan Peters
‘06 in the 39th minute and senior captain Joseph Hansen netted a
header offa Zed Yllma ‘05 free kick in the 79th minute

“The first thing that makes St. Norbert college a reauy darr
gerous opponent is their team speed," said rrrseycar coach Brian
Jawotslti,“l think even more important is that when they get orrthe
bus, they expect to win,"

A reasonable expectation, as St. Norbert currently sits atop the
conference at 4-0 (9-0—1 overall) and intimidated the Pioneers with
their stature.

"Against us, we gave them no reason to second guess that type of
mentality,” added Jaworski.

Lawrence, while perhaps not as skillful as st. Norbert, provided
a more physical test for the Pioneers. The Vikings Joe Sluhoski
scored what proved to be the game winner in the 22nd minute un-
assisted as the Pioneers work ethic again could not and its way to
the scoreboard.

“Our game versus Lawrence was a very entertaining game to
watch," said Jaworslti. “I thought both teams played attacking soccer
that was both physical and fair. 1 an. very proud that our guys rose
to the occasion and played their best game orrhc year at the most
important time."

The Pioneers (3*6 overall. 14 in conference play) hope to shift
into gear for the second half of the season, and Jaworski believes
that it begins on the training pitch. “We have gotten to a point in
practice where it is not only okay to challenge the other gnly, but it
is expected," he said. “We are just beginning to play {or one another.
The best is yet to come.”

The old adage "you’ve got to score to win” applies
with extra force in the case of GRINNELL WOMEN'S
SOCCER. In the Pioneers' three defeats, their
opponents have tallied six times. By contrast, all
of Grinnell’s seven victories have been shutouts,
including two this past weekend, and the

Pioneers have scored 33 goals in those games.
GRINNELL WATER POLO upped its mark to 9-0
with four victories last weekend. The Wild Turkeys
upended Knox, Carleton, St. Mary's and Macalester
by lopsided margins. WOMEN'S TENNIS defeated
Central and Augustana last weekend for its seventh
and eighth consecutive victories. The team has

no remaining ofﬁcial games until the tonrerencc
Tournament on Oct. 15, meaning that the Pioneers
will ride a 37—day unbeaten streak into Rockford,
Ill. next weekend. VOLLEVBALL Went 0-4 at the
Elmhurst College Tournament last weekend, running
