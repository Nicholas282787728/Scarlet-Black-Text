Grinnell activists protest
curtailing of civil liberties

Activists react to November protest arrests, including the arrest of Grinnell librarian Chris Gaunt, and recent attempts by the
federal government to subpoena records from Drake University’s National Lawyers Guild’s anti-war meetings

by Diiara Yarbrough
On Nov. 16, 2003, Grinnell llbanIan Chris Gaunt was ar-
rested when protesting in Des Moines, lowa. “I rate charges of

assault on a peace omeer, interferenee with arrest and trespass,"
said Gaunt. “My plea is ‘Not Guilty,"-

The Nov. 16 rally took place at the lows
National Guard headquarters, and 12 protest.
ers were arrested,

These arrests were part ofa ehain orevents
that led Grinnell college aetivists as well as rep.
resentatives or national organizations seen as
the American Civil liberties Union and the Na.
tional Lawyers Guild to question the motiva—
tions or government omeials in their interac—
tions with lowa protesters.

Grinnell anti—war eetivists Eli zigas .06 and
Matt Cleinrnan ‘06 believe there is a relation.
shi p between the arrests oraetivisrs at the rally
and recent subpoenas otdoeuments from Dials
University's ehapter or the National Lawyers
Guild by federal omeials.

A federal judge demanded that Drake uni.
versiry provide detailed information about an
antiwar meeting sponsored by the Drake ehap.
ter orthe National Lawyers Guild and held in
Drake's student union the day before the rally at which Gaunt
was arrested, Doeumentation or the names or all participants and
intended participants and the names of otheeis was subpoenaed.
Four Des Moines aetivisrs were also subpoenaed.

The subpoenas have since been dropped, an aetion Cleinmen

A REAL, LIVE

PUPPY IN

“I've already spent three
days in the Polk County
Jail for my actions on
Nov. 16. Anyone who
knows me knows I would
never assault anyone,
especially not a police
ofﬁcer. My life is about
peace and nonviolence.”
—Chn'5 Gaunt, librarian

attributed to "the support eoming in nationwide for subpoenaed
individuals," including artieles in the Des Monies Rtgim-i'and the
New yir/e Timer.

Both Cleinman and Zigas attended a demonstration against
these subpoenas in Des Moines on Fcb. 10,
2004.c1einman estimated that there were 150
protestors In attendanee, a number he said
“may have seemed small" but “was lowaehuge.
The largest lowa antiwar protest had 500
peopleiaftcr months or planning. word For
[the Feb. 10] demonstration went out less than
40 hours before the event.”

”I felt the need to be voeal in rallying
against what i pereeived as an unrusiined abuse
orgovernment power,” and zigas. “This rally
against these subpoenas demonstrated oursup.
port for the ability to have these types otmeet.
ings without a future threat oreourt aetton for
what was said or done at the meeting. Basie
tally. the eivil liberties related to peeeerul as»
sembly and exchange or ideas were being
threatened."

“I think that what happened to me on Nov.
lo, followed by the reeent subpoenas of the
tour peaee activists from Des Moines and the
subpoenas and gag order at Drake University, ate mieroeosms or
what is happening all over this country," said Gaunt. “I see it as a
huge effort to stiﬂe dissent."

According to zigas, the federal government choosing to sub.
poena reeords from a university anti—war meeting is without pie.

I’ll chew on almost
anything. And the

petitioning ourgovernrnent in the form orprotest," hesatd. “HavA
ing been involved in anti-waraetivreyon an lowa eollege eampus,
these subpoenas eould well have been diteeted toward me. My
reaeuon was one or rear. Fear orwhat lines the government was
willing to eross in order to prove a ease."

“This is a level orgovernrnent surveillanee that rriany are eoin.
paring to McCarthyism," said Clernman. “I believed that there
was a good ehanet the government was trying to intimidate pro.
testers while learning more about their tasties, In my opinion,
the government's delay and subsequent eaneeilation or the sub
poerias veriﬁes my tears,"

“[Tlie Feb. to protest] was dii-eetly about subpoenaed anti.
war aetnrists, but I would argue that it was mush bigger than
that,” Cleinman said, “This is the latest in a pattern or poliee
repression ordissont. This was about ensuring all dissenting voiees
ean be heard." '

Cleinman attributed “an inereased police response to protest.
ors" to the “FBI JointTerrorism Task Force," Arrest orptotestots
lilse Gaunt indieates that “police are keeping a elose wateh on
protesters," said Cleinman.

“l‘ve already spent three days in the Polk County rail for my
aetions on Nov. 16," said Gaunt. "Anyone who knows me knows
I would never assauIi anyone, especially not a poliee omeet, My
