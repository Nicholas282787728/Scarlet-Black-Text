At the and of last Semesu‘r. Stove Larson loft Grinnell for a job
at Utsinus College. Larson had worked in Grinncll for eight and
a haliyears, originally as an RLC, then as interim housing direc-
tor and finally as housing director. When the administration den
dried to combine the Residence Lire and Housing departments,
Larson was put in charge ofbothi

With Larson gone, the administration has made changes to
the structure of Student Affairs, dividing Residence Lift; and
Housing authority into two different jobs Sheree Andrews now
heads Residence Life, while RLC Mandy Fox is in chaIgc off-{oust

ing.

Sheree Andrews

Andrews was previously the director ofstu.
dent Activities, a position that entailed coordi—
nating student use of the Forum and Harris as
well as overseeing New student orientation
(NSO). With the promotion to assistant dean
and director of Residence Life, Andrews re»
sponsibiliries have changed. She now hires and
trains all RLCs as well as student advisors. Dc-
spite the change in position, Andrewswill con-
tinue to work on N50 in the future

“I really like my new role," Andrews said.
“it fits with who 1 am as a person and my expe.
ricncc." Andrews said preparation for her new
position consisted mostly of oncthe-job training. She met With
Torn Crady, vice president for student Services, and Jennlfer
Krohn, dean for student Life, as well as all the RLCs. Andrews
also worked on the transitioning process with steve Larson be.
fore he left Grim-tell.

Many students considered Larson to be one or the strongest
advocates ofself governance, Andrews plans to continue his 3pc
proach. I too, am a strong proponent of self governance be
cause it really fits with my parenting style, Andrews said People
should be rcsponsibl: for themselves."

Andrews does not believe the change will greatly affect stu»
dents. “There will be some change because I am a diitercnr per.
son than sreve Larson with a dirierent personality, but we want

things to be as smooth as possible for the studcnts," Andrews
said. “I’m ieaIIy eacrted, and I’m looking ronvard to working with
all ofyou. I want to hear about what people think about icsidcn.
rial lire and any suggestions they have,"

Mandy Fox

Fox was previously the RLC for Main, Cleveland and James.
Although she is maintaining her role as an RLC, she now also
acts as the lnlcrli‘n director oil—lensing. Fox said that before Larson
left, he gave hcr a list of49 different tasks the housing director is
responsible for. Some other new jobs include making housing
changes and assignments. working with the Housing Committee
and billing students for property damages.

despite this increased amount ordorm space,
getting people signed up for next year's holis-
ing is going to be “quite a task," Fox said.

Fox thinks she may have been promoted
to inreiim director of housing in part due to
her long experience working with Housing. “In
some ways 1 was uniquely qualified tosrep in,"
Fox said. “I was the assistant director of Hons
ing (or two years as an RLC. l've been on the Housing Commie
tee for three years, I've been part ofthe room.draw processes for
three years, I have a good sense ofwhat steve Larson was doing
most orrhe time and I already know most of the people on the
Housing Committtea”

Fox’s experience has helped her adjust to her new role. “I think
it’s been mostly a good transition," Fox said. “I don’t have every-
thing ﬁgured out yet, but i do know who to ask ifi have a oucs.
rion.

Fox's workload has increased. “My email volume has doubled
or tripled immediately," she said. “It’s difficult.but1’m managing
and I’m enjoying the challenge of it. us a perfect challenge for
me in my career at this point in my life."

The future

Both Andrews and Fox an: a little uncertain about the future
structure ofStudcntAfFans, “I thinksonie decisions need to be made
burl think that the structrrrc will stay the same," Andrews said. “Tom
[Crady] and Jennifer [Krolm] are going to assess the situation, burl
thinkwe can kind oraseume that things won’t change too much,"

Fox echoed Andrews. “1 think that studcnr Airtirs still needs to
make some decisions about how things are going to go next year I
don't know ifrhars omcially decided. I think they want to continue
this structure, and that‘s probably what will happen but it’s not been
sorted out for sure.”

stove Larson was the only dean who had supervised both Resi»
deuce Life and Housing simultaneously, Cmdy said, “We're going to
try this sriuctuio for a while i , and reassess it this spring," Crady
said. “Typically Residential Life and Housing were split, so we are
implementing a structure that we havc used before.”

Crady said that the decision to combine thc two jobs after Larson
left was also due [cl the need for increased funding for counseling on
campus “We had seen an explosion in the use ofcounseling on cams
pus, so we took the money from the reorganization [ofStudelIt Afr
fairs) and put it in counselingservices," he said. “That’s clearly what's
going to have the most impact on students." Aside from more access
to counseling services, Crady does not thinlt that the students will be
affected by the structural changes of student Ali'airs.

The organizational changes in student Affairs have forced RLCs
to take on additional responsibilities, creating a concern amongsome
students that access to their RLCs has become limited, Most RLCs,
however. do not seem fazed by the changes. Stephanie Masra, the
RLC for Cowlcs, Norris and Dibble, who now also works in Ame
dcmic Advising, said, “I don’t think our time for students has re»
ally changed, burl know the shift in my area ha given rnc the oppor»
tunrry to work with students in a different way. i don't think that any
orus really reel like we don't have as much time with students, but it's
different time."

Fox agreed with Masta. “it's a little too early to determine. I'm
not going to be hanging around my apartment as much, but, andl
told my start this, I am your RLC and I will be there when you need
me," she said. "on the ﬂip side, they know where they can find me
for three and a halrhours orthe day. So daeir accessibility has changed,
in some ways improved and some ways not."

said Rosenbaum. “Asubstrmcc-frcc space on carnr
pus, that was clearly advertiscd as such, could
provide a meeting place for students looking for
something to do, who might currently fcel like
they have no options but drinking."

The Housing Committee has yet to give a
clear definition of “tubsranceftce” and hopes
that next year's Smith residents will agree on
dorm policies, laying out when and irintoxicated

students will be permitted to enter the dorm.
According to the Grinnell student handbook,
“residence halls at Grinncll ideally are intended
to be self-governing units subject only to broad
parameters ofallrcampus social policies and rcgu»
Iarions.”

Though the statement on substance-free

Larson, claims rharstudents living in Smith Hall
