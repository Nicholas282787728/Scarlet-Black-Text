College rslog‘avnvrltrend‘lealreg’students feeling fearful,

5v MATT ZMUDKA

Grinncll college has limits. You can only
take one piece offruit at a time from the dine
ing hall,you cannot earn more than 18 credits
in a semester, and you cannot burn down any
collegeeowned buildings,

Unless one is a prospective student, in
which case you can do all of these things, be-
cause Grinncll has “No Limits.”

It sounds like a contradiction, but from a
marketing perspective, it isjust another way to
sell our dear college. Grinncll is not uniqule in
joining the trend ofcollcge marketingw here
branding and catchy phrases trump pictures of
the grassy lawn at the center ofcampus

The “No Limits" material rs part of a cor
ordinated effort including direct contact, elec-
tronic marketing, and visits to college fairs
and conferences, all to promote Grinncll and
what it means: “We go on high school visits
and connect not just with studenls but €01,
leagues in counseling offices we give them
the language to articulate what Grinncll is to
high school students," said Seth Allen, dean of
admission and ﬁnancial aid.The three things
he talks about when promoting Grinncll are
the open curriculum, international presence,
and self-governance.

“No Limits“ was developed in 2005 by
consultant Mark Edwards of Edwards 8L Co.,
who has left his slogancering mark on places
from Hobart and William Smith Colleges
(“Ferociously and Totally Liberal Arts") to
Skidmore College (“Creative Thought Mats

ters") and Macalester College (“Education for
a Global Stage"). Edwards, who could not be
reached for comment, also helped develop the
All-campus science Cclebrarion as part of
the Noyce dedication

Allen is not thrilled with slogans as a
marketing tactic, hc docs not have particular
objections to the “No Limits” campaign. “To
distill it down to a few words really doesn’t do
the institution or the students oi the faculty
justice, Allen said. But if you have to do it,
I think it fits as well as any other slogan out
there.

Julie Hoye '09, SGA vice-president for
academic affairs, disagrees and said she takes
issue with “No Limits"on many levels, the first
being the slogan itself. “I've encountered a lot
ofliti-iits at Gr'innell. We don't have limitless
resources the classes [students] want to take
aren't offered all the time, they get cut out of
classes all the trme,”she said,

Many students agree that the slogan sends
the wrong message to both perspective and
current students. “Do Grinncll students really
want to he the kind ofpcoplc who think rhcre
are no limits in life)” asked Nathan Pavlovic
'10.

But the greatest problem students have is
with the Concept ofrcducing Grinncll to a slo-
gan. “We’re a unique population and we don’t
think we can be reduced to two words or a
single phrase,“ said Hoye.

John Burrows, SGA vice-president for Sm‘
dcnr arraits, agreed. “Grinnell students don’t

like going to a slogan school/They don’t want
to try and confine [Grinncll] into one slogan,
even ifit is limitless."

catchy phrases have become the norm
for college institutions and if, like l-loye, you
are not quite the limitless type, then perhaps
Oberlin College ls a better choice,where view
hooks created by Edwards advertise that its
students are “Fearless.” Isabel Roth, an Oberr
lin seconthycnr, doesn't agree, “we're not exV
actly a bunch of daredevils," she said. “People
feel Like it's trying to change our more hippie,
peace-loving persona."

Oberlin had a former slogan, “Think one
person can change the world? So do we.“
Gr'innell's previous admission material was a
hit of a hodgepodge, according to Allen. ”It
was more adrhoc, which is the way it used to
he everywhere."

some of the images used to advertise
Grinnell are still a hit or a lrodgcpodgcma
hodgepodge that does not accurately i-cprcr
sent the campus. There are no giant peas in
the swimming pool or cows with saddles at
Grinncll, but these ate some ofthe images dee
picted in the monstrous Grinncll View book,
measuring twelve inches on each side and
brimming with glossy images and foldout
pages.

Ohetlin’s view book is a similar size. “The
aesthetic changes of the brochure are very
modern and seem to be cateting to a much
more preppy-oriented incoming class,“ Roth
said. Edwards said in an intetView with the
Oberlin Review that his materials are designed
for 17 year olds, not college students,

Allen said that 18 to 20 thousand of these
books are distributed to prospective students
each year nd that it has a shelflife of five to
eight years. "In this view book, when it was
architected, we decided to go with a very rhe-
milllc approach to Grinncll. The idea was to
make this a construct or what the college was,
and I think that has been successful." he said.
mentioning that the next iteration might be
more realistic and include more pictures of
Grinncll.

However, I‘onc thought the content (or
lack thereof) ms a bigger problem. “There
was a ballet partnership doing a dance in a
barn. Where on our campus is there a barn, or
a ballet class that does partnering? she said.
‘Are we educating people adequately about
Grinncll before they get here?

Despite its ribbing by students, “No Lim-
its” appears to have been successful in recruit-
ment. Last year's class was one of the largest
in history and Allen said that even more stu»
dents have started Grinncll applications on the
Common Application website this year than
in previous ones.

At Oberlin, students are beginning to “c,
cept their marketing,“thn the Fearless Came
paign first came out, there was a lot more tips
roar now it's more sort oflike an old joke,"
Roth said, adding that their college president
cven jokes about it now. “No Limits” seems to
be following in the same path. “1 feel like it’s
kind of just become a campus-wide joke," said
Glen Clark'lO.

Students may be amused, but the higher
ups are not yet convinced. At the May trustee
meeting, them was a presentation and discus
sion on the success of the admissions came
paign, where Edwards presented a “really in
tense PowerPoint display that had different
slogans he tried with different focus groups [of
prospective students]," according to Hoye,‘“No
Limirs'was the most exciting and the most m,
ticing . but what about accuracy?" she said.

Whr e there may be tweaks, the premise is
staying the same for the time being. “Is it suf-
ficient in and ofitself? Absolutely not. It needs
context," Allen said.

As for Oberlin’s slogan, Roth and her
friends thought that “Oberlin—hug a tree" or
“Grassroots learning" would be better slogans
than “Fearless." She was also confused by “No
Limits", saying “The first thing I thought of
was binge drinking." It appears that the Cree
ators oflast year's mug for 100 Days, proudly
emblazoned with the phrase “.08 , No Limits"
thought likewise.

 

If we no longer had "No Limits”:

your genitals. Or at least the
inside of your mouth.”

”Cooler than you since 1882...
wait, is that when we were
founded?”

—Ben Flebbe‘ll

”Sex, drugs, and indie rock,"

”A lot of limits and a lot of
money.”

”Grinnell: Where even Student
Affairs will teach you critical
thinking.”
