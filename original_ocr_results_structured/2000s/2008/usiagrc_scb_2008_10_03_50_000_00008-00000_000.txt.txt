GIT brings the apocalypse to Grinnell

BVALISARGENT

A pseudo-hippie stoner and a stuckrup
socialite walk into an elevator, and the hip-
pie says to the socialite, “Are you going to the
fourth floor?" Sound like the start of a dirty
joke? It's actually the end of the worldi and
the start of Grinnell Independent Theater’s
new production 77;: End (atNt'tc ShaeVr'A Port
dper/l/y [it Sartre. The show, which opened
Thurs ay night, is the first full-length GIT
show in recent memory.

In the spirit of GIT, even the script for The
End came out of an odd process. Sean Dune
away '09, the director of the play, chose to edit
his older brother Gavin's play, which he wrote
in high school. At first, “it was just about two
women ﬁghting over shoes at the end of the
world," said Dunaway. The play was 72 pages
long, with a run time of three hours and the
cast and crew ended up cutnng the show to 52
pages and a run time just over an hour.

The play became a reality when Dunaway,
Aja Saunders '09, and Sabrina Eatdonille ’09
applied for an open space Production, an op—
portunity sponsored by the Theater Depart-
ment which gives a gtoiip of students 6100
and access to the department’s facilities to put
on a short independent production,

GIT is best known on campus for the far
mously ridiculous (and often inappropriate)
student-written one-acts. Lucky for us, TIM
End is no different, and like all things GIT,
it was conceived with little regard for con-
vention,The plays follows the relationship of
Rachel (Lexi Leuszler '12) and hippie stoner
Jamie (Kelsey Tollefson '12) who are the sole
survivors of the apocalypse that was sent by
“The Keepers" to wipe clean the slate of hue
mankind.

“It’s more ofa project than a performance,”
said Saunders, assistant director of the show.
“We had to make the characters seem more
human."

While the final script has more than its
fair share of sex jokes and absurd dialogue, it
stays true to its characters, and "it’s not over
the top," Dunaway said. ”There were a lot or
overrrhertop lines we cut out.”

“And a lot of overrthertop lines we added,”
Saunders interjected.

“I thought it was a really great satire ofmar
terialjstic America,” said Leuszler, of her ﬁrst
reading of the play. “I thought it was very well
written. Really witty. "

The show may need a few more touch-ups
before it hits Broadway, but the crowd is sure
to be pleased. “It's deﬁnitely written for college
students," Saunders said.

“Rachel is a rich, socialite hitch, I guess,

essentially," Leuszler said. “[She’s] very smart
though she knows how to manipulate."

Rachel's chief manipulation is her body,
which is described as being so enhanced by
plastic surgery her gender is ambiguous.Throw
in retail worker Jamie and a pair or six»inch
black leather heels, and the apocalypse-level
catfights, emotional breakdowns and laughs
are destined to ensue,

Two more characters try to reign in the
chaos. Ben Tape '12 plays the Time Keeper,
who is essentially the narrator ofthe show, and
along with the Future chper (Ashley BaCr
cam '10) observes the two women from their
bureaucratic lair up in the sky. “[They‘re] the
civil servants of the universe," Dunaway ex—

plained. "Doing the nitryrgritry ofkeeping the

universe in line.”

Tape’s character has the vibe of a sports
newscaster, while Baccam’s character looks
like a schoolgirl out of TtaMam-ar. “Basically
I crash the show. it's a whole diirerenr play
when I come in,"Baccam said “Did I forget to
mention I'm bisexual?"

Despite their low budget, the production
crew does a clever job using light and sound to
create an elevator in a vision of a post-apoca-
lyptic worldThe nuclear wasteland set pieces
include burnt up Barbies, army men, and toy
guns, and various rusty metal objects they got
from scrapyard 15 miles outside ofrownr “[Set

Both consumerism and classism are major
themes, but by the end of the play, like the end
of the world, what it ultimately comes down
to is relationships. “It's a stoner and a socialite
in an elevator in a postrapocalyptic world and
they’re trying to figure their shit out," Saunr
dets said.

And then, of course, there's the obvious
message the Apocalypse hrings. "In the end,
we're all gonna die,” said Saunders.

Open mic night fosters creative mood

Sunada Vaidheesh ’12 enters unique world and emerges amazed by community

By SUNANDA VAIDHEESH

As I entered Falconer Gallery Wednesday
night, I realized that the backdrop of Shimo-
mura's paintings would immediately impact
the creative works of the writers who would
soon speak at the open mic, The cartoonish
t’aces intensiﬁed the echoing voices of the write
ers, and the creativity shown in
both mediums shone forth in
brilliant color.

Open mic nights,which usur
ally occur two or three times a
semester, are hosted by Grinnell
Libraries and Falconer Gallery,
and all are invited to come rind
share their own work or of an
author who Inspires them.

The pieces presented by
students and staff ranged from
light-hearted poetry to a hltmtly honest and
humorous short story to an excerpt from a

ranrasy novel written by a student. While each
reading was vastly dirrcrcnt from the last. what
was particularly notahle was how the changes
in genre and tone oteach reading weren't jolt-
ed or awkward in transitioning.

As each writer stepped back, their message
comfortabl faded into the scene and set the
stage for the next read
ing The atmosphere
or the gallery, with the
bright colors and poi-
gnant images surround-
the audience in a
comfortable cocoon,
ﬁlled the dramatic anSr
es in the readings with
even more signiﬁcance.

The evening hcgan
with a poem by Elizar
beth Rodrigucs, Burling Staff (“Of the Many
Names to Which I Could Have Answered")

that aptly set the tone for the night.The pieces
by Elliot Karl ’12 (“Losing My Place in Line
on Judgment Day") and Chris Davies ’11
(“Mirror") evoked dynamic images and did not
venture anywhere near cliche.Tliey made their
carefully crafted words appear to fall together
as though the ph'tases were always naturally
strung together.

The short story, “Chevrolet Bel Aire" by
Carolyn Jacobson, English, captured the audit
ence's attention with a scathingly blunt openr
ing Line about how the narrator “f““d up her
uncle‘s death,” and proceeded to weave the
narrative in a humorously realistic fashion.
The excerpt from Zyme Burris ’10 book “A
Bedtime story" poscd an intercsting contrast
as it explored the fantastical journey of the
narrator through the land or“lnsanity,"

While the evening showcased some of
Grinnell’s finest writers eager to share their
literary prowess, l have to wonder how much

more talent there is in our community. lfmore
students were to sneak out from naps in the
Fireplace Lounge or their dorm rooms to
share their jaunts into creativity with fellow
Grinnellians and staff, open mic nights such as
this one would be even richer.

Even for those who do not want to share
their work but want to experience Gtinnell’s
literary grandeur in a nutshell, nights like these
provide a great opportunity for them to celr
cbrate each other.

As i gathered my scarf and slung my back
pack over my shoulder, I couldn't help but no-
tice the writers around me as I exited the gal-
lery The formerly shy smiles and nenous eyes
ﬂitting around had transformed into relaxed
and shining cheeks, glowing with the adrenar
line rush ofwords and color.
