heroes will be announced in 2008.

The Spanldutg Buggy Factory, whose
building will house the museum, was a ma-
jor factory in Poweshiek counry from 1902
ro 1917. The rectory produced 16,000 bugr
gies per year at its peak prior to switching
to the automotive industry in 1908, and was
Poweshiek county's largest employer, ac-
cording to the museum's website.

The museum is being funded by a com
bination of state and federal grants, as well
as by private donations. Grinnell college
provided matching funds in the amount of
25,000 dollars to help buy rhc Spaulding
Factory property, according to Amy Kalke
brenner, Acting Director of Community
Enhancement tor the college.

To supplement this funding, the muse-
um is seeking local money and involvement,
“We’ve had a lot of support from the local
people," said Brooke, “and we’re hoping to
get some more support going locally."

The idea for the museum originated in
Ames, where retired Department ofTranse
portation personnel imagined a museum that
would preserve the history oftransportation
in Iowa for future generations. In 2001, they
decided upon Grinnell as the future site for
the museum because of its rich transportae
tion history and central location.

The museum planners intend to bring a
considerable number ofvisitors from in and
out of state to Grinnell. “It’ll be a tremene
dous asset for Grinnell as far as bringing
people to town," said the President of the
Grinncll Area Chamber otcommeree Larry
Goodrich. “It will draw people to the shop-
ping disrricr and restaurants," he sald.“Some

people will stay in a hotel for rhe night and
go to the museum the next day.”

But in order for this economic lnv'tgorir
tion to occur, the museum must be exciting
and attractive to tourists. “They have to have
something that will draw people, something
exciring enough to pull someone off Irso,"
said Howard McDonough, president or
the Grinnell Historical Museum. Mr. Mc~
Donough is a consultant for the museum.

According to Kalkbrcnner, the new at»
traction will improve life for Grinncll StUT
dents too. “Anything that increases tourism
will also improve restaurant options and the
quality oflife downtown," said Kalkbrenner.

A public presentation of the proposed
interior design plans will be given on Tues
day, February 19, at 6:30 pm. The presenrar
tion will be held in the Veterans Building
in Central Park, and the museum’s architect
will be present to answer questions.
