Activists have to make us care

Cant. from pg. 11

they will have a huge and immediate impact on the
world. Wind turbines have probably done more
to put Grinelliuns’ collective environmental cone
science at case than prevent the catastrophic cori-
sequences of global warming. To be fair, efforts like
the student anti-apartheid campaigns of the 1980s
certainly led to great changes, but would it be too
shameful to admit the real value of campus activism
is what we get from participating,

As college students, we simply lack the time
and resources to contribute signilicantly to a variety
of deserving causes, But we do have the opportur
nity to learn from activism to become more effect
tive agents for change in the future. Involvement in
campus activism and groups provides opportunities
to learn about a fascinating array of issues, mcct in—
teicsting people and in many ways learn a bit more
about outselves.

Campus activism isn‘t an issue of how much
change is achieved or how fast it happens, but of
what we learn in the process. It is a significant coni-
ponent of the liberal arts education we’re hen: to

acquire. One of the most important pars of that
education is learning how to make our knowledge

 

relevant to everyone else.
It’s not a simple matter of talking about the is-

 

sue. Magnifying the significance of every issue ul-
timately trivializes them. While there are examples
to the contmry, Gtinnellians tend to be informed

 

individuals, familiar with a variety Of issues and
their potential importance. Appeals based on the

 

 

vital importance of the issue at stake aren't persuar
sive. so instead ofrehashing old news and painting
scary pictures, perhaps other approaches should be
considered.

I’m far more intrigued by a person’s unique in—

 

 

 

terest in an issue and why they believe it warrants
the use of their time, It’s harder foi me to ignoie
someone ifl know and respect what makes them
so passionate. Encouraging campus activism is an
issue of the intended audience. As frustrating and
upsetting as it inightbe that most people iirent ime
mediately engaged by the seriousness of the issues
that are frequently promoted, students are never

Striding, not crawling, through Grinnell’s bars

Nine enterprising student explore all that the bar scene has too offer—with mostly positive results

In an attempt to recreate the mirth
and meiriinent cxpeiienccd in the
“good ol’days" by his older brother, Wil-
lic Stewart '085 suggested that a team
of brave souls venture forth into the
now Pubeless world, It was time, he as-
serted, we discover what lay beyond the

Rallying behind Willie's idea, Brie

gamerplan, accompanied by a map, for
our ambitious night. There was only
one rule: everyone was responsible to
purchase one pitcher over the course of
the evening. Two pitclicrs, eight drink-

The third pitcher consumed too
quickly, our time at Game was up,
lsoisrerous goodbyes to all the patrons
earned us an invitation to return at any
time. For a group of nine 21 year olds

like a vote of confidence in our favor,
The short walk over to the Eagle's Club
was more ofa stride ofpiide.

Unfortunately, our time in the Ear
glc’s Club was marred by a dlscourter
ous bartender intent on accusing us of
sneaking in undemge. our IDs were
ridiculed and a ﬂashlight shone in each

cr customers had to endure. Before the
two pitchers made
it to the table we
resolved to leave as
quickly as possible,
