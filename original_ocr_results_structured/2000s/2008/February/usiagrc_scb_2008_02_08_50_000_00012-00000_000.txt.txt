Can you ever go home again?

Returning from abroad, most students expect relief and a return to the familiar. But many find that between re»
uniting with friends and reconnecting with Grinnell, coming back can present as many challenges as leaving did.

Everyone knows that going abroad can be
frustrating, difficult and lonely. Few expect
to feel these same emotions coming back to
Grinnell, but sometimes the return journey
can be almost as difﬁcult. “They're uncomfortr
able in a place where they used to feel perfeetly
at home,” said Director for OffrCampus Study

Richard Blight.

Josh Burdick'09 is still adjustingto Grinnell

after spending last semester in Costa Rica.

“It’s like ieverse cul— tuie

shock," he said.
“It's familiar, but then it's
because you feel like you're new."

Burdick has struggled to leave his new
home and renrrn to old friend groups. “I had
just gotten used to all these new things." he
said, “and suddenly I was thrown back into
friendships 1 hadn't maintained for eight
months."

According to Bright, such feelings are
fairly common. “Life has moved on in their
absence," he said. “They're trying to get used
again to a place they knew well but now see
differently."

Chris Farstad’09 arrived back from St. Pe-
tersburg and is having similar problems figur-
ing out how to talk to his friends about his ex»
periences over the past few months. “Kind ofa
wall is set up. You want to talk about things but

you don't want to come off as always talking
about Russia," he said. “At the
same time, it was a growtng CX’
perience in general. it's not just
that i went abroad,l was also
getting older as a person."
Many students who go
abroad face changing perspeo
tives and new experi—
ences alone, and upon
returning, they face the
task ofshowing the rest
of campus their ”new
selves”. Complicating this
attempt are the friends
who did not go abroad.
Many struggle not to feel bet-
rer than the triends who stayed be-
hind.
“it's a cliche that people defir
iiitelyreactagainst,"saidFarstad,
“and I understand that com,
pletely. You shouldn't look
down on people that don't
go abroad just because you
did."
But Ruth Manski '09,
who just returned from sri
Lanka,nonerhelessstrug-

rior snooty thing in my
head sometimes," she said.
students may struggle with such
feelings, because experiences abroad
can feel transformative, leaving them
to explain to friends what they’ve
learned.
“It was like reaching the top of

Burdick’s experiences in Costa
Rica altered many of his views, em-
phasizing family and necessity over
materialism. He is eager to retain his new per-
spective, but worries he will not be able to. “It's
hard to come back to where people are less
motivated by family," he said. “It's really easy
to come back and slip into the old life without

"Your values get resors

things you never used to
criticize, and appreciating
what you never appreciated."

Farstad finds his pers

since returning. “1 take less

“And [I] am more conscrous
ofwhat I waste."

periences in Botswana. “It’s not

abroad," she said. “It’s more a
matter of wanting to share your
experiences.”

Kaiser, who went abroad to
Botswana last fall, misses being
in an environment where help
is always offered without the eXr
pectation ofverbal thanks. “The idea of recir
procity is different,”she said.

Bright understands these needs among m,

The “reverse culture

however.

Food is one of the most welcome changes
for many students coming back. "I was excited

Farstad did not even wait to get out ofthe
airport before frnding a bagel. After living on
meat, potatoes and pasta with mayonnaise, the
bagel was one of the first signs he was back in
the States.

some were just ready to speak English
again. “1 was so tired of the extreme effort
it took just to think," said Burdick, “It's nice
to come back and be able to express yourself
comfortably all the time. And not stand out

Farstad, who does not speak Russian, still

The Office of off
Campus Study at one
pornt offered welcome-
back events for students,
hoping to ease the transi-
tion. However, attendance
was consistently low. “We
thought to ourselves, this isn’t what students
want,” Bright said.

Despite this setback, the office is now
working on a student symposium to discuss
experiences abroad. Bright hopes to help fa-
cilitate students settling back in at Grinnell.
“1 think many of them feel as it they're being
uprooted," said Bright. “it's important that
people realize they’re not alone, And that's
part of what we can maybe do for them. To
bring them together."

Manski still misses parts of her Sri Lank-
aa experience. “There are a couple of other
Grinnell kids who went to Sri Lanka with
me."she said.“and I keep ﬁnding myselfwantr
ing to go hang out with them and talk about
Sri Lanka."

Burdick is also getting back to life as usual.
“I’m getting back into the rhythm of being a
college kid on a college campus," said Burdick.
“You can’t expect yourself to readjust right
away."
