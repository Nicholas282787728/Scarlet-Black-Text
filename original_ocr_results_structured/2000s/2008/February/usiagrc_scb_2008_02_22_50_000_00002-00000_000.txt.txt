Experimental College classes to begin

mt KAI IlItvN BENSON

This semester, Grinnellians who long to juggle, learn how
to cook or study Poi spi g have an outlet for their curios-
iry—Grirrnells Erperinieutal college (Erco) ExCo is a proe
grain that allows students to teach classes on topics or their
choice to fellow students, faculty and members
ofthc community.

Suzanne Polny ‘09, EXCD co-organizer, ate
tributes the programs popularity to a new, less
rergerous application process for teachers and
a more casual enrollment process for students,
which makes it casier {or students to sign rrp
for classes.

ExCo was ﬂoundering at the begrnnrng of
the 200d 07 school year, ”with a significantly
diminished number of both classes and pal-
ric‘tpants. That year, the program came under-
new leadershrp, and thanks to a revised appli—
cation process and more aggressive public'
its popularity has steadily grown ever since,

The program is funded with an allocation oftlre SGA budr
get, and because ofthis year's popularity, the program’s budget
has grown to 32,000. Funds are allocated to teachers depending
on the size of each class,

This year, ExCo offers classes both on tratllrional academic
and nonracademic subjects. Rachel Walberg '09 is teaching
“Knitting: Basics and Beyond,"which will reach students basic
knit and purl stitches and allow students to learn more advanced
techniques ofthcir choice, such as shaping, lace and cabling.

This is Walberg's third semester teaching an ExCo class,
and she has been knitting for about four years. She says that the
crart is ”something that a lot ofpeoplc think is a lot harder than
it is," This semester, students will start the class by making a

JeffSinlck '09 will teach a course entitled “Basic Wine and
Food." in which he will teach students about different types
of grapes used for wrnc, regions of the world which wine is

produced and rhe pairing or wine with food.
Sinitk also taught the course last semester, but
said that the enrollment for this year is signifi—
cantly higher. “Probably three times as many
people signed rrp as last semester,” he said. In
addition to his class sessions, Slnick also hopes
to include a field trip to r local vineyard in the
semester’s activities.
Both struck and walbcrg praised the car
sual atmosphere ot’ExCo for its ability to M,
tract a wrde range ofsmdcnts who might have
a casrral interest in a subject but not enough
time to study' it in depth.
VValberg said she feels really need about
providing somerlung non academic, and is
even considering applying for a Watson fellowship to study
how extracurricular and craft activities foster a more positive
state ofmind in our rapidrﬁtc culture.

Sinick said ExCo is a good diversion from Grinncll’s usu-
ally rigorous academics and helps students relax. The EXCO
classes. he said, are “kind of a way to relax, and to learn about
rhrngs you can’t get the college to teach.”

If ExCo's popularity this semester is any indication,
Grinnellians are embracing an opportunity to unwind and cater:
crsc their creativity. Polivy said that she was pleasantly surprised
by the participation this year and hoped it would continue in
the future. ExCos a really great program, she said. Were ex-
cited that people are embracing it so much the year.

Hamenn said that the mental health services Grinncll pro-
vides are inadequate and that the recent restructuring of the
college's mental health services created the potential for insrir
tutional breakdowns similar to those that may have occurred at
NIU after the shooter stopped talking his rncelication. “Follow-
ups wrth prestrrptrons are not enforced," she said. “They don't
require students on prescription drugs to meet regularly, and they
