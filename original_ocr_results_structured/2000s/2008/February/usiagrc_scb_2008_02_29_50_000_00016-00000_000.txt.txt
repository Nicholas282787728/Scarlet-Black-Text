Done before, done better

Diablo Cody won the Oscar? Are you kidding
me? Juno was written like an episode of Gilm—
ore Girls. Cultural references are more important
than a joke’s content. Every character in the mov-
ie has the exact same manner of speaking and the
exact same sense orhuinon It’s like u monologue
with different faces. Thank God some the'actors
were good and actually differentiated their unr-
acters. Frankly, I feel sorry for Ellen Page, who
was handed the jokes ofa had stand up comedian

,then asked to integrate them into a person's life.

Honestly, I didn‘t hm the movie I just hate
that it got so much credit. Everything in . this
movie has been done before and done better. A
lot of the elements of the movie were done well,
but it’s really too bad that the worse categorical
aspect ofthe movie won an Oscar.

Students speak
about what‘s on
their minds in 142
words or fewer,
and you’re invited]
if you have a rant,
'e-mail it to

plaining in a public
forum is always
more fun than do-

, Open up the comp‘uter lab

It seems to be the attitude of this institution
that we can govern ourselves in the science build
ing, in the residence halls and with our illicit sub.
stances, but not in computer labs. The new lab in
the psychologywing orNoyee —which used to be
my bastion of sanity, quality computing, and late
night work— is now locked when no TC is present.
In spite of our percicved desire to destroy compute
ars, labs sueh as the MrthLAN manage to survive
without too much guidance or looking. I don’t see
any reason to keep people our of this particular lab.
Especially since. it has specialized software-found

on only a few computers and is an important re:-

lease valve for people wanting to use the Science
Library. '_

Compttters?'No. Frustration? Yes. Respect for
students’ need ro do work? Apparently nor. ITS,
this lab is the “Apple" of my eye, keep it openl

NBA corhmencement talk -

With the increased budget for the 2009 Com-
mcncemcnt speaker, Grinnell really only has one
option: Sir Charles Barkley. This makes sense for
three key reasons: 1) the trustees want to increase
Gtinnell‘s proﬁle. Getting Charles Barkley would be
national news.Also, he would probably talk about his
uperienee at Grinnell on Inside the NBA1 the Emmy
Awardewinning show which he caehosrs; 2)Charles
Barkley can speak insight-fully on both race and aniv
mal-welfare. For example: “ColonelSanders is the
greatest white man that ever lived.’ 3)Ch2rles Bar-
kley can give live life-long advice, e.g.: “Sometimes
the light at the end of a tunnel is a train." So that ‘
we can hriug Charles Barkley to campus and fulﬁll .
our destiny, please write to meinhere of the Con
mencemenr Committee and tell them, “I WANT
CHARLES BARKLEY!‘
