Saturday Noise Nights

BVJAMES ANTHOFER

What does one do on a typical Saturday
night at 7:30? A movie always remains a possie
bility, as does a quick Facebook or email check
before any festivities get started. But truly ads
venturous students might want to think of a
different way to start the night: Noise Night
at Bob's. .

Each Sat. around 7:30, Boh’s comes alive
with music, often from unexpected sources. At
this showcase ofavanttgarde music, pcrrorine
ers tend to be whoever happens to be around,

1 had originally planned to merely observe
the exmtement, but Emily Iwuc '08 convinced
me to just join in. “It wouldn’t have been any
fun tojiist sit there and write a story,” she said
later.

I agreed, since i was one of about only
three people sitting observing the musicians,
which included up to six players/performers
at once. 1 participated in the strangest of the
weird nights, Acoustic Noise Night, which
meant small and quiet, not perhaps the image
one associates with “avanvgarde.”

We made music out ofpipes, metal grates,
a cello, two acoustic guitars, a bass pedal)
trashcan combo and some old Jello boxes.Thc
sound of clapping hands, stomping feet and
various phrases, drones and screams also pro-
vided some texture.

I didn't feel separate from the group, but
we didn’t necessarily play off of one another,
and instead broke apart typical structures
rather than creating them. Daniel Fumta ’08
contributed guttural mouth noises, with Iwuc
providing cemmenrary from time to time in
the form of competing growls or the status»
tic “Why don’t you go cry about it>,"which he
usually answered with a plaintive tug on the
cello.

Chris Farstad ’09 and I played the guitars,
usually playing single notes or off~keyechords.
The time passed quickly—it was a quarter af-
tcr eight More I looked at the clock once, and
when the playing sort of slowly wound down
around 8:30, I didn't feel like I had been part
of a laborious or difficult process.

we made some great sounds, buried in
light dissonance and outright weirdnessl felt
welcornc even though I didn’t know any of the
rest of the group very well or at all, But once
Furilta packed up the cello and the baristas bet
gan to prepare to serve, we knew it was time

Survive the cold with spiced-up take on college classic

You’ve probably noticed that it’s cold outside. 80, if you just happen to have a few things on hand (or have taken a hint from our squirrel friends and
stocked up for the semester, or have a raidable fridge at your disposal), you can stay in your warm, cozy dorm rather than brave the windy, ice—covered
tundra of the Grinnell campus. Granted, there are a few necessities that you might not have, but remember—RLCs are your friends, too, and they’re oft
ten willing to loan you what you need if you ask nicely. Assuming you’ve managed to scrounge up a few ingredients and cookware (an excellent reason
to have voted for the initiative to make cookware available for checkout inthe lRC), here's a new twist on an old classic: Ramen.
