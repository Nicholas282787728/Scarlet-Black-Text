Revolution! Sixties, Vietnam and self-deprecating Disney

Enchanted
(2007i

Disney pokes fun at itself
and princesses grow up

Movies in which the Walt Disney Corpoe
ration mocks itself are few and far between.
But the venerated film company may recently
have acquired a sense ofhumor in Enchanted.

The movie opens in an animared rairy
land, where a beautiful young woman named
Giselle (Amy Adams) sings and dances with
her animal companions as she awaits the are
rival ot her Prince Charming, Enter a con-
veniently placed ogre and a handsome prince
who comes to her rescue (james Mardsen),
and Giselle thinks she's found her happily~
everraftet, But through the conniving or the
princes wicked stepmother (Susan sarandon),
the princess ends up in New York City

The llvcraction Giselle goes in search of
her Prince Charming with the aid or a cyni-
cal divorce lawyer (Patrick Dempsey) and his
young daughter, who truly believes Giselle is
a fairy tale princess. The lost maiden’s inno—
cence is off—putting at first as she attempts to
naively navigate her way through life in the big
city, but as Giselle begins to adapt, real world
audiences will ﬁnd themselves drawn along
with her on her adventures.

The brilliant: of Enchanted lies in Dis-
ney’s decision to ﬁnally ﬁnd some humor in
its saccharine happily-ever-after fairy tales of
the past. References to Sleeping Beauty and
Snow White abound in the film. Yet the movV
it: cannot stand on this device alone, Instead, it
relies heavily on Adams’ ability to breath life
into Giselle's character and endow her with
intelligence, sincerity and determination. The
growth of the fairy tale princess is what ulti-
mately makes the film such an enjogmble two
hours,

hodgepodge musical homage to rhe Fab Four
and their era was a purely cinematic one, May
be it rhere was something more on my iPod
than 011: I would have found Bono's cover of
“I Am the Walrus” a bit more exciting. As it
nus, like the rest of the movie, itjust struck me
as a cheap ploy,i easy way to spur nostalgic
feeli that the viewer might mistake for are
null excitement and emotional connection.

Hey/ride. dudLui-y, and Sadie, anal/ha, midllvc east of)!” Bear/cranirpn-edgang in Across the Universe,

of"Hcy Jude" was intended to be moving, but
was instead sterile in its predictability.

Visually, Tayn-ior does some interesting
things, playing with montages, perspectives
and occasionally crossing over into the sure
real, But every time I was about to be drawn in
and get lost in the images, the too-close musi-
cal overlaps threw rhe tanrasy back to earth,
Nothing original was actually happening,
only a decades-old mood was being toicibly
brought back to life,

The movie only begins to cross over into
creative territory with its covers of Beatles
classics, occasionally radically retashioncd, in
particular, TV. carpio's slow, melancholic in-
terpretation of“l Vi/ant to Hold Your Hand"
almost made vmtching at least part ofthe film
(i.e the first ﬁve minutes) worth itThen again,
the original isn’t so very sacred to me. But, afs
ter watchingAnorr (1M Uriiario, it doesn't seem
like such a had idea to keep some distance her
tween our cultural icons and us.

them even further.

Brought to you by Stanley Kubrick, the
ﬁlm begins with the story orPrivare Pyle, also
called Leonard Pratt (Vincent D’Onoftio) _
who just does not belong in the Nlatines. He
is overweighr, unmotivared and somewhat
of a simple-minded tellow. Pyle's experience
in boot camp isn'r a pleasant one—he does
everything wrong from packing food in his
unlocked footlocker ro chickening out in the
obstacle course.

You feel batl for poor Leonard, but that
doesn’t lesson the reprimands and ridicule of
his fellow boor campers, led by “Cowboy"(Arl-
is: Howard) and “Joker" (Matthew Modine).
Eventually he arrives at a bitter end that will
certainly squelch any interest in the Marines
(ityon had any inclination toward rhe Marines
to begin ivlth).

Here the movie shirts gears ro show us what
war is really like but slows down considerably
We followJoltel' to his career 5 iijournalist for

in contact with Cowboy who has been fighting
in “the shit" since boot camp.
