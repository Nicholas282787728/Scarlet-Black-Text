Twentieth century Fox’s Fem Gully: To Last Rain am!
(1992) has all the makings otn classic. It stars big names, tea»
tines distinctive animation, and bears a stillerelevant environ-
mentalist message.

Unfortunately, Fern air/1y has not aged as well as its cartoon
tools from Disney and Pixar, despite featuring Robin Williams
(still riding high on the success of his Genie in Aloddin),Tim
Curry playing the terrifying villain Hexxus, and Checch and
Chong ﬁlling out the cast for additional comic relief.

The movie revolves around the ottorts ormngicnl rainforest
fairies to prevent evil loggers from cutting down the forest. It's
basic Hollywood liberal values, but for kids, so it’s fun, and as
Wall—E so aptly proved earlier this year, the ideas behind Fem
Gully's message have become even more, important recently

However, unlike Pixar, which seems to imbue all its ﬁlms
with a timeless quality. Twentieth Century Fox, for all their
trying, have yet to achieve anything that isn’t easily disposable.
The jokes are just too dated and {all ilat after 15 years in the
can. The songs, too, do not achieve that magical quality that
makes Pixar or Disney ﬁlms stand out as great artistic state—
ments; rather, the songs plunder the pop culture oi the time,
and become little more than poor imitations of already poor
co)ntemporary rap (think Marky Mark without the Sexy sing—
er.

The film confronts deforestation with power and panache.
chxus, the slime-monster villain, is just as frightening, if not
more so, than even the scariest ﬁends from the other studios.
He delivers such shocking lines as, “Mmm. that's a good smoke,
like mother's milk," with vicious lellsh itnd is sure to terrify all
the kids (and adults) in the audience. His horrifying trans
formation from harmless slime to skeletal demon serves

Canadians critique capitalist cronies

In many ways, it is uncannily appropriate that The Colpoe
valiim is a Canadian production, because such an unabashed
critique otthe corporate world is unlikely to be an American
veirnire, However, such a perspective doesn't necessarily make
it a movie that's anything bUt painful to watch.

Essentially, The Cmfal‘ﬂll'un is a series or interviews and
slides and video footage wrapped into a polemic about the evils
of its namesake,

With examples as {arranging as IBM's role in the Holoe
must, to the suppression of an investigative news story about
Bovine Growth Hormone on a Fox News Channel afﬁliate
television station, the movie pulls no punches in its attack on
that paragon ofAmerlcan capitalism.

The movie raises mnny pertinent questions considering the
modern corporation as a class orperson and evaluating its bee
haviot towards society and the wotld at large as a psychologist
might evaluate an ordinary person. The overarching theme is
otcorporatc social responsibility, the notion otlimitcd liability,
the corporation as a psyclrapath, and the corporation as a pore
son.

students looking for excitement on Friday ni in will

likely ﬁnd themselves in Main, with the horror Elm fest

uad and “The Main Patty” throughout the rest of the
building. out the primary draw of the night will definitely
be in the basement, as Brooklyn's Yeasayer performs in
Gardner Lounge.

Yettsaycr's inns should mix well with the rest of the
Halloween night festwities. The band’s live sets are usur
ally accompanied by trippy visuids projected behind them,
and the haunting, almost spiritual sound oftheit songs may
cause a few ghouls to rise from their graves.

Selfdeseribed as “Middle Eastern-ps_vch-snap—gospel,"
the band‘s inﬂuences are often atuihutcd to the vague cat-
egory nf‘world music.’ But while they may draw many of
their sounds from outside the United States,they have be-
come known as part of the growing Brooklyn music scene
of Grizzly Bear and TV on the Radio

With their love of world rhythms (malty reminiscent
otthe'ralking Heads), matched by Beach Boy csque har-
monies, the songs rake on a transcendentaleeven spiri—
tual—quality. But these grand sounds are matched with a
general sense of gloom in their lyrics On their standout
song “2080 " they sing "I cant sleep when 1 think about
the times were living in, I cant sleep when I think about
the {um I was born into,’ concluding that since we’ll all
be dead by 2080 so we might as well live in the moment ,,
