What was your experience like in Red
Stockings and the Gay Liberation Front?
on one hand, 1 was very happy in joining
Red Stockings because they had a political
analysis of what was wrong, you know, how
women were replessed. They had developed
consciousness raising. And, I participated in
consciousnessuaising groups. My unhappiness
with Red Stockings was tliatwllile tlieybelicvcd
the personal was considered political they did
not feel the same way about lesbianism. They
felt that lesbianism was personal and the rest
was political. So, when the Stonewall Uprising
happened, I joined the Gay Liberation Front.
And, there were other women like myselfwho
came there from the women’s movement. But
there were also people who were street transs
vestites, people from leftist movements, and
people with no previous political experience.
So, it was kind of interesting. It was a mixed
bag ofpeople. And,l had a great time in terms
of things that we did like orga izing dances
and marches and political acti ties. On the
other hand, there were some of the problems
With the men that I had encountered With the
straight women. So, some of the gay men were
sexist, And, eventually a number of the women
from the Gay Liberation Front split off into
a group, which became the Lavender Menace.

1n the prologue of your memoir Tale: of
the Lavender Menace, you wrote, “Naturally,
young people assume that anyone their par-
ents‘ age is no longer sexually active, Their
mistaken perception that I'm some kind of
eunuch has been shaped by politicallyedriye
en historical accounts that paint a picture
of radical feminists as an anti-sexual." How
would you speak to such misconceptions?
on one hand,l have to say that the stereo-
types served to protect people like me who are
radical, because it wouldn‘t be as comfortable
if my students saw me as some sexual radical.
And, on the other hand,l think that, you know,
people like myself who have fought for this,
wc don't want it to bc cnlscd.l think a lot of
lesbian activism on behalf of sexual freedom
has been erased, And, we have been viewed
as these people who are somehow polrrrcal
but not ﬂesh and blood. In writing the mem-
oir, I tried to balance those issues out. I think
part of righting is to write a memoir and to

be honest about the kinds of sexual act‘

I engaged in and not to try to cover them up.
One of the things that I feel fortunate about
is that I lived in an era in which sexual actiVe
iry was very safe, relatively, The worst thing I
heard of someone getting was a gay man gets
ting a case of the clap. But for lesbians, we just
never heard of things like herpes

and chlamydia. So, I think that

people were able to live in the time

ofsexual freedom. And I think that

the danger underlying that is that

today its a very different world

sexually The world has become a

lot more sexually drngerous for

young people. We were quite free

to sleep wirlr whomever we want-

ed to, and that's how I lircd luv 1' A \\’c bce
lieved that monogamy was a war ot ticatirrg
your partner as a piece of property. And, so
very few people I knew were monogamous
That's just how the era was, I think that most
of the people I knew back then have changed.

Why do think that students today are not
protesting like tliey were in the sixties?

It’s easy to look back on those times and
think that people were more heroic in tclms of

taking on universities. But I think that history
has changed a lot. I think that people today are
in a difﬁcult spot. That spot may change ifthe
wars were engaged in continue and students
wind up being drafted agniiit Thar was one
of the big differences between then and now,
which was rhe draft. And when you’re person-
ally involved in a war because you

or your friends are being drafted,

, it really changes the way that you

see that activity when your friends

come home boxcsr And I think

that college students today are

somewhat exempt from what's

happening in this real world orwru.

What do you think college
students have gained from the ’68 Columbia
Universitynptisings?

On the one hand, 1 thrnk that rdcnts
demanded that faculty rind adminrs r. ion in
universities be more receptive to their needs.
One oi’rhe drri renccs that I see today that
came out of that is that college presidents to-
day ure like real life people. When I was going
to college, we vaguely knew who the president
was and we certainly didn't know the deans,
The only time you ever knew who these

people were was if you were in trouble. It was
like being sent to the principals ofrrce in high
schoolr We really didn't have any interaction
with these peoplel think that college students
today have demanded accountability from
people, and the students have been empow-
ered by that. When 1 ms in college, I never
heard a student complaining about anything.
We never complained about grades. We never
complained about abuse by faculty members in
various ways. I had one Italian professor who
uscd to slap us in class. He'd coir you in the
head. And, I complained about it. And they
did nothing.That was the attitude. I think it's
changed today. I think that ifa professor was
bopping you on head in classrhc school would
step rn immediatelyl rlrrnk thats it big gain
7 the empowerment of students, the cmporw
ctlnent of student organization What hisn'r

r:'l\angcd m a way is that the university holds
your degree in their hands ind they hold the
funding that you ve given them for student ac-
tivities. So, that sr‘ill makes the power structure
very unequal in the way that univo rrres are
run.

FTP asks for pledges of support for environmental position

Liv HANNA LiELlL

Among the Campus Democrats and party
collectors- knoekrng on dorm room doors some
new faces beating bright vrcen pledge cards
have also begun crnvassing for signatur.cs

Members of Free the Plrrrct (FTP)l \avc
been collecting pledges over the past month
for Power vote, a national,bipartisan campaign
organized by 46 environmental and social jus-
tice organizations and over 700 local groups to
mobilize young voters concerned about global
climate change and to pressure politicians to
address environmental issues

According to its website, Power Votc's
platform Is a call “to lead the world towards
a just, clean energy economy that moves be-
yond dirty energy, creates green jobs for all,
and secures our climate." It further states that
its young signatories “commit to holding
leaders accountable through their sustained

involvement, and create a Pow-
chlilft."

Power vote's organizers aim
to get one million young votels
to support then platform pilot
to rhc election, said Juliana
Will s, the Mitlw-sl crmpus
o rfor the Si StutlcntC ,

a n, one of the organizations work-
irrg on Power Vote. As ot'l‘hursclay the
campaign had 300,000 signatures.

According to willrams, frlling out a
pledge card is a way of“saying that you
are a part of this movement of young
people who want to see our leaders do
more about clean energy,"she said.

After hearing about Power vote
from Williams. FTP members Caroe
lrne Kory '11 and Alcnka Flga ’12
brought the campaign to crinnelr.

Despite a late start and fall br ,
as of Tuesday, cruwassers had
received no pledges flom SUIT
dents and hope to reach 300 by
Electron Drly,

According to both Kory and

ta, trrrdcnrs reacted positively

p 'gn. “I feel good about

signing it," s d Kathryn Vanney '11,
an FTP member who tilled out a pledge
when VOlLInl’EuS knocked on her door. “I
think us a good way ofdemonsttatrng my
commitment to alternate forms ofencrgy

and chang s i environmental policy."

According to Susan Hildebrand '08,

a Power Vote organizer in Madison, WI,
the presidential candidates are aware of
and responding to the campaign often
calling organizers to see rfthey will he

“They know who we are—

Kuly and lrga hope that signature cole
leered at Gnnnell will also be used at tl u ,,.
pus level to add weight to arguments about
environmental issues presented to college ad-
ministrators. “We [hope to] get solid numbers

is great," Hildcbv

Crrmpargn leaders both on turd offermpus,
scc Power Vote as a strong, gras roots youth
movemen with the potential to radically die
rect polui ans focus towards environmental
issues in the coming years. “Nationally, the
strategy is to demonstrate our power to
show leaders at all levels that they have to pay
attention to this," Kory said, “And that their
political futures rest on our shoulders, because
we’re awnre, and were voting."
