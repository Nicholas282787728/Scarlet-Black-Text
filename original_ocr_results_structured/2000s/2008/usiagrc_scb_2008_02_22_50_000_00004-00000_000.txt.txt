Award-worthy films playing this Osca

Michael Clay-
ton (2 OO 7)

One of the year’s best films

George Clooncy stars as an attorney and
former gambling addrcr in the title role ofthis
slick legal thriller. He works for a prestigious
law firm in New York City as a “fixer," sonic-
one who rectifics difficult situations, often
through unconventional or expedient metlr
ods, It’s a story about ethics and their absence,
a slow-to-boil requiem for American decency
ur which Cloeney, the ultimate name in luxury
biands and decadence of the Western woild,
taiscs the sword in the name of tiuth,justicc
and good.

As for the riveting plot, after meeting with
a colleague‘s key client who had accidentally
stiuck a pedestrian with his car, Clayton sees
some horses near the side ofthe loud. I-lc stops
driving, leavcs his car and climbs a hill to go
admire the animals. erile ire is watching the
horses, his car explodes in a ﬁreball. Then the
movie ﬂash back to four days earlier, and the
ﬂashback involves a signifrcant portion oftlre
plot. 1 don't want to give the details away, be
cause this is, after all, a thriller, and spoilers just
hurt the overall impact of rho movie.

Clooney gives the ﬁnest performance of
his career as the morally complex Michael
Clayton, Hrs screen presence, dialogue delive
ery and acting are all perfectly in sync, and he
stands head and shouldcrs above the rest of
the cast.The supporting actors are no slouches
themselves, witir Tom Wilkinson playing one
of the frrm’s leading attorneys and Tilda swin-
ton as the firm’s largest client’s (an agrichcmir
cal company UsNorth) chief counsel.

Tony Gilroy directs with a steady hand and
a steady eye, with none of the visual frenzy
that characterizes the Bourne thrillers. His
film moves rather than racesThere are no real
downers to this movie, except maybe a disapa
pointingly neat climactic encounter that seems
designed to give Clooney the last, rousing
word, or maybe just a shot at an Oscar.

Miabar/ CI/Iylorl is a morally alert, persua-
sively realistic and suspenseful melodrama,
with impeccable acting and handsome dircca
tionr Dark in color, mood and outraged world
view, it is a frlm that speaks to the way we live
now. This is modern Hollywood cinema at its
finest.

the tyrannical and frighteningly calm Nurse
Ratchcd (Louise Fletcher) and her rule over
the ward. McMiirphy attempts to cure his {61,
low patients with unorthodox treatments like
pickup basketball games and sneaking ofrfor
a day affish'mg.

The cast is what truly tlrrves this movie.
The various mental patients each add a dark
humor to the scenes, providing the punch lines
in their responses to McMurphy's sctaups. One
particularly memorahle scene involves Mc-
Murplry introducing rhcm as doctors, followed
by closeups of every patrcnt's face, complete
with what they presume to he a very doctor-7
1)! look. Nicholson and Fletcher both earned
Oscars for their performances in this movie,
and it's not hard to see why. For every bit of
a wild, anarchrsric yet strangely noble person
that Nicholson portrays, Fletcher is his icy ope
positeiunwavcrmgly cairn and collected even
in the midst ofmadncss.

Iftlrere is a flaw to this movie, rt is rn how
rt bends reality to put out its parable oficbcl-
lion. All of the residents of the ward, besides
McMurplry, act as little more than comrc foils,
The only exception is the Chieflwm strmpa

Strong short films make
up for weak stretches

Film shorts should he a huge part or the
popular culture landscape. Ar their best, they
can explore topics and media and ideas not
possible or necessary to convey in a feature
length frlnr. Howcvcr, they are too often ig-
rrorcd, often in ways that seem to defy artistic
intentions, like whcn Vl/cs Anderson’s T/JL'DIIY"

its companion shoit film, Halal Clown/in

So I want thcsc film shorts, culled from \‘C’

really did love most of the second half ofthc
almost tlrrcc hours ofshorts, from Family Tau

actors in tlrc shorts, l-larlantl Williams, and

But the first half of this collection suffeis,
almost without exception, from sloppy writing,
