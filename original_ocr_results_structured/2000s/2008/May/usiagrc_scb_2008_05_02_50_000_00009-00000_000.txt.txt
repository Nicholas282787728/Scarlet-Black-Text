Theatre and Dance “spring” into season with
show choreographed by students, visitors

nv REBECCA PARK

This past weekend, the temperature may
not have agreed,but students were in a warm—
weather state of mind, metaphorically trans-
ported outside of Grinnell by the leaps and
bounds of the Department of Theatre and
Dance's “springl" dance performance.

The eclectic show drew on a widctrange

of styles, themes and talents. Faculty, student.

and guest choreographers represented both
Western and African modern dance in pore
tormances ofvarying theatricaliry.

Kathleen Hurley, Theatre, kicked off the
show with her sparse and thought-provoking
“Grotind-Floot Arrangement." Incorporak
ing the spoken word with modern dance, the
piece was a meditation on interacting with
the domestic environment.

“My husband is an architect, so all over
our house is all kinds ofblueprints and archi—
tecture hnnks, and we're always talking about
architecture," she said. “It just kind of pops
into our coiwersiition, and so I started being
interested in the idea of choreographing in

relation to the space."

Hurley also choreographed the second
piece,“Shifted in Flight," performed by mem-
bers of the Dance Troupe. Depicting a 19305
airplane voyage, it featured original music by
Des Moines musician Rob Lumbard, who
played onstage with the dancers.

“He's not afraid to try new things, he
takes risks," Hurley said. “For him to actu-
ally be onstage, in costume, to be a character
in the dance was something really different
for him."

The next dance was a solo performance
or the wol'k-in-pl'ogrcss “Ninga,” by guest
choreographer Christian Bambara, Barnbara,
who is from Burkinit Faso, combines modern
dance with elements of traditional African
dance. Originally scheduled to dance with
his wife Celia Weiss Bambara, the piece was
modiﬁed as a solo after she injured herself.

most eerie lack of music and dramatic light-
ing that often hid the dancers in shadows or
complete darkness.

The finale, the ensemble piece “Tanks
rumstaak," highlighted choreographer Bnm~
hara's unique style of modern African dance.
Language Assistant Christian Kittety, one of
the dancers who performed the piece, corns
mcnted on the challenges African dance
poses.

“It’s. totally different, the music is differ-
ent, the rhythm,” he said. “So we cart try to
ﬁgure out to put like European counts in this
kind of music to make it easier to learn, but
it’s much more a question offeeling, breatht
rag, because it's really demanding when you
do all these movements and you need to find

once inside yourself to be able to do all

The diversity or performances meant
there was so ‘tl‘ung for everyone. “It seems
like people ei iyed the variety of the show,"
Hurley said. “Overall, it [has] been very posi-
rive."

 

A student salon to
make Monet proud

BYALI SARGENT

Alongside the French academic salon in the
19th century, the Salon de Refuse arose as an
avaritsgartlc alternative. Nov/,unore than a hun-
dred years later, it’s about Lime Grinnell had a
Salon de Refuses of its own, and this weekend,
thanks to Sarah Mirk '08 and Becca Taylor ’08,
the school will,

Hosting it at their off-campus house, Mirk
and Taylor conceived the Salon d: Rc’ﬁisés as an
alternative outlet for art the schoolrsponsored
Student Art Salon rejects.

“A lot of my friends made art and submitted
it to the Salon, and because the Salon is so selec-
tire, that means a lot or my friends got rejected."
said Mirk Hosting a Salon dc Rc‘fusés was a Corr
cept Mirk had been thinking about for a while,
and tinally “we were like, ‘This is the year we're
doing it," she said.

Mirk and Taylor’s Salon de Re’fuse's is a reﬂec-
tion of the spirit for spontaneous an outside more
traditional settings that has been taking over
campus, seen with the demand for more public
art, a plethora of new campus hands, and the tor—
mation of the club ARTRA. “Lots of students
are excited about making art outside the box right
now,"Mirk said.

Because of the number of mists at Grinnell,
Mirk sought to create another type of space so
that the year didn't have to ﬁnish with any rejec-
tion,“l don't want there to be any negative energy
for art at the end or the year. I want it to he posit
Ewe."

Despite her ercitement at anally carrying out
a foureyeareold concept, Mirk is apprehensive it
will he taken the wrong way as an attack on are
schoolesponsored etent. “I was a little nervous
telling professors about it because I thought they
would get upset," she said.

But unlike the original Salon dc Réfusés,
which was a rebellious protest against a sturiiy,
academic, deﬁnition of art, Mirk notes that her
salon is meant more as a complimentary alternate
rive. “I'm really glad the salon exists. it's good to
get that recognition for your work,"said Mirk

While she recognizes the importance of
a more professional salon setting.th hopes
to broaden the palette of the campus art scene.
“'I wanted to have a little bit more of a mucous
space," she said. “Ifwe have a space and a time to
throw a party for everyone who’s not in there, why
not do it.> Why not have more art on campus?”

organizers of the Faulconcr salon share
Mirk’s scrrtimerrts,“lt's really great that Sarah and
Becca are arranging it," said Veronica Erb '08, a
member of the Art SEPC who is also involved
with the Faulconer Student Sulon.“It’s not a hos-
tile thing whatsoever.” Many students, including
both Etb and Mirk, will have pieces shown in
both salons.

In preparation for the erent, Mirk and Try
lot are taking down all other decorations, and the
whole house will be open for installation. Mirk
urges anyone on campus not only to attend, but
to participatwthcy'tc taking any and all srrbmise
sions. “I want to sec art in the kitchen cabinets,”
says Mirk, “I want to see an in the bathtub."

The Salon de Rehrscs begins Saturday, May 3

Average ice: A Bizarro Story by Mike Kleine

I sometimes have this recurring dream. In this dream,
I'm falling from heaven, and heaven is New Jersey. Since
I have been conditioned to believe that heaven is situated
'above my head, my dream appropriately places New Jersey
somewhere in the sky, amidst the clouds. On the map, in
place ochw Jersey, there's China. They had to use a lot of
vegetable oil to make China fit. I don’t think China is happy
with its new home.

in my dreams 1 eat cars. sweat treat my toes, use Gri'r
zly bears as transportation vehicles, and sometimes go back
in time to slap the doctor's race as rm being born. l'm a
pretty simple guy: I like pickles in my coffee, occasionally
get married and repeatedly curse at little kids that eat too

much candy.

I sometimes get super powers Tire problem is that they're
singlesuse super powers so once they're expended, 1 don't get
them back. I’ve only gotten three super powers in this lifetime,
My first time was in twelfth grade.While sitting in Super—Sci-
ence class, I envisioned an Otiental elephant inhaling oatmeal
through holes in his tuslts, and in a matter of thirteen scconds,
my Science teacher was crushed by an aging oriental elephant
directly imported from Japan (with my mind.)

Right now, my seventh year in community college, I’m sups
posed to be taking my Alaskan Politics filial in two days, biit I'm
not going to do it. l'rn hoping to get an apprnptimely-beneficial
supcl‘ pnwtr able to help me out with this situation. Instead nl'

studying for the final, I am currently standing over a pool
orwhat appears to be a puddle made of mud and saliva. I
have no idea how it got here. Wearing sandals and a tuxedo,
Yd 1i to say that I invented the look, but that would be ii
lie it was inspired by Jesus, who I'm srrre would have worn
a tuxedo had he been able to wear one back then.

I haven’t slept in 37 days and now, it’s gotten to the
point where I'm talking to a man made ofcar parts. I'm sure
he's imaginary but my mind would like to tell me other
wrse. As the days go by, the air starts to smell even more like
pineapples. Ovcrsatuiat‘ion can become a deadly thing.

I always wonder why bnrvling halls aren't made ni‘ ivo-

ty.
