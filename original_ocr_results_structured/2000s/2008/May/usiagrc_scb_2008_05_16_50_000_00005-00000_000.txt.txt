Elderkimronicles: Born to Dag

With an Elf-like last name, Topher Elderkin has been a Dag mainstay, while also diversify-
ing his presence at Grinnell through theater, modern dance and religion

Wlule some students may question
whether to participate in D.rg,'roplrer- Elder-
kiii has not wavered from his commitment
to the group Whrle not tlic stereotypical
“Dag Kid"—he avoids “hard scmlices" when
possible and does not speak ElvishiEldcr-
kill has been an acrrve participant since he
rrrst laid eyes on the foam longswords and
clayrnores.

But this brave
swordsman is by
no means one»
dimenstonal. He
has been an ac-
tive participant in
the Theater Der

Grirrnell, playing
such illusti'ioiis loles as Oberon iii A Mid-
sununer Night's Dream,

Elderldn has been a part of the Tlicatcl‘
Department since his ﬁrst year at Grinnell
and, with the freedom to mice what classes
ire wanted, began to diversity lus experi-
ences by taking voice lessons and Modern
Dance classes,

“I wasn't in public high school anymore
and didn’t have tons of [other] academics
taking up all otnry tim "he said.

Elderkin, a Religious studies major,
found that the Modern Dance class he took

last semester was one of the most insightful
classes he has taken.

Having always been interested in ex-
pressive movement through yoga and Dag,
he found that there was something special
about iiiodcln dance because it “wasn't like
jazz ol ballet, With some framework," he
said. “It focused most on authentic motion
and not ﬁtting
your movements
into some pariic»
ulat dance move."

After life at
Grirrnell, Topher
plans to work at
one of the cola
legcs in his home

back from the Center for the Humanities
regarding whether he will receive an offer
to do his own Religious Studies research
throughout ncxt year.

Ideally, Elderkiii plans to go into a career
in chaplautey. choosing to avoid preaching
doctrine in favor of“cncoutagiug religious
life and helping people and something that
works for them, [which is] intuitively more
natural for me, i don't know tny own road
well enough to tell people which one to
take."

Piano player pursues musical dream

Allie Kieffer forgoes law school to study critical music theory at Yale graduate school

When we were talking several
years ago, Allie Krcticr asked me
to give her sortie moral reinforce
rntnt “Ifl cvet waver," she said,
"just tell me to go to law selrooi."

Kleffer was wrestling between
two competing desrrcs. pursue a
career in law, wlricir she irked—or
an academic career studying mu»
sic, which she loved. it was a rough
choice.

to a n tr a,
however, Kleffer came to the ﬁrm
conviction that law “is iust not
who I am" and that slat should
rollow her heart and study music
Krerrct will go to l'ulc University
in the fall in l1lll5\ll(0(t\ Hi I). in
Music History and hopes to one
day teach at a liberal arts college
hicc Griniicll.

On one level, it is not too sun
prising that [Gaffer ended up pure
suing music. She has been playing
the piano since she was eight, and
unlike malw young musicians. she

- never had to be forced to pr tree.

“I was always really cxcttcd
about the idea or pi ro lessons,"
Kieffcr said. “1r was always some

sons.

Even today, Kidler spends
much or her tree no practicing
the piano. "Exccp ts not really
tree rune, it's pracrrcc time," she
said.

Allic's adviser and piano teucie
or, litigant: caub, Music, describes
Allies personality perfectly “She
can be so unassuming. yet that

takes you oh grind, because she's
absolutely brilliant." Gaub said.
“it's a brilliance combmed with a
complete lack orprcteosion that i
had very reficsl'iing,"

This semester alone, in the
span ofa single week, Kicher both
performed a senior piano recitale
more than hair an hour long, all
the songs but one from memos
ry—aud presented her MAP on
competing French and German
styles in the music of Romantic
courposer Gabriel Fauré.

'rhc recital was “the most
stressful thing l"ve done at
Griiinell," Kieﬂ'er said. “That's a
lot to keep in your head. You have
to practice it an absurd amount
iusr to reel secure. You think rt’s
rock solid, and than whcn people
arc there it's really easy to doubt
yoursell‘."

Kjeffet's technically demand-
ing performance or works by
schubcrr, Fauté, Beethoven and
Ravel was exceptional, and, in a

typically conscientious gesture,
she baked her own ceoldcs tor the
postrrecital reception.

l—lcr MAP prcsentation, an
application of critical theory to
music history, roreshudorvs her ﬁr
ture caleer, “I really hitc thinking
about a dominant way or hearing
music, and then a way that other
people might have heard music,"
Kieffer explained. “I'm interested
in Romanticism and the way
that ideas about sclt and identity
in that time period changed the
ways that people thought about
and composed music."

Unless she changes her mind
one more time—a rernote but
horriryiuglr possible prospect tor
Kroner—her oscillation between
law and music has finally ended
with what she always wanted,
deep down to do urost. “I think
I'll be happ‘ in can ware about
music and teacir,"l<rel’tersaid “It's
doing what you like {or a living
and getting paid tor it."
