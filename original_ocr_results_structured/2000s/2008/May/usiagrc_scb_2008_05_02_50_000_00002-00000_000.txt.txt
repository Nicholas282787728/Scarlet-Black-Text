SEG to expands direct loans

ovTortiuzyMAcGrtccon

Starting i business can be difficult for anyone, In developing
countries, where bank loans are often hard to obtain, the task
can be nearly impossible. But a group of students at Giinnell
have taken notice and are doing their part to help small busi-
nesses get off the ground,

The Social Entrepreneurs ofGrinnell (SEG) are a group of
students who raise money to give out low-interest loans to indi-
vidunls in underdeveloped countries so they can start or expand
their own businesses. When Jeff Radcrstrong '09 created the
group in April 2007, the majority offunding was done through
Kiva, n website with a network of community organizations.

But recently, SEG

began to look for.

a new way to loan a

[the new goals of
the SEC] over the
slimmer," said SEG member Jamie Zwicbcl '08 “I thought if
they didn’t want to loan through Kiva, why didn’t they loan
directly to these entrepreneurs or directly to the community?”

When Kiva is in charge ofdisrriburing funds, loans are done
through a series of middlemenThe drawback is that Kjva and
the companies they work through charge interest rates around
In an attempt to bridge the gap between themselves and those
who receive the loans, SEG began to work directly with entre-
pteneurs. By partnering with new organizations in Malawi and
Nicaragua, the group can offer lower interest rates and create
closer bonds with the people they assist.

With over 85,000 in its budgetisome ofwhich has come
from repaid loans—the group could afford to implement less
secure directeloau partnerships, which would be without the
protective umbrella of Kiva oversight. The new partnerships
were forged with two organizations: the Centro Promocional
Cristiano (CFC) in Nicaragua and the social Entrepreneurs of
Chivwauo for Development (SECFORD) in Malawi.

Zwiebel had been working with sewing collectives in Ni-
caragua but knew that the CPC also had a credit department
that was in need of more money for loans. After she joined
SEC in the fall, she participated in meetings where members
of the group debated whether or not the CPC could be de-
pendable enough and initiated a dialogue with the CPC about
their plans for the money. “We decided to go forward with it
because it’s a really worthwhile organization—it does have a
lot ofcxpcriencc with credit," said Zwicbcl. “So far we’ve given
four loans out [or a total of 3600,"
Mark Root-Wiley ’09 initiated the contact With SEC—
FORD, which SEG is still developing a partnership with this
spring, "1 had a

done all this trains
ing, but they didn’t
have access to the
capital" said RootsWilcy, “I think that's where we can really
come in...find these organizations that wouldn’t have access
to capital and try to bring them into this whole new world of
microﬁnancer"

RooteWiley sent SECFORD a message, and the organiza
tion responded back with a comprehensive business proposal.
“It was really overwhelming," he said, but noted that the bene-
fits ofseeing a partnership grow are well worth the difficulties.

Creating permanent relationships with NGOs all around
the world could be the next step in the evolvmg goals of SEC
and may be one ofthe most exciting developments to come out
the group. “We've already got feelers sent out to a third parte
ner,"said Harry Klejsa’10,a coaleader ofSEG.

SEG began as a fairly simple project, but recently students
have grown increasingly excited as the group grows. “It's a re-
ally good organization for casual microfinancing, but we're get—
ting more hnrdcore,"sa'ld Kresjn,
