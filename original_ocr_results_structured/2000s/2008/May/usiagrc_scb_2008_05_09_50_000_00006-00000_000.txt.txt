Crowe, Bale face off in wild

remake of Western ClaSSlC

A remake ofa 1957 film ofthe same name,
3:10 to Yuma is probably the best Western pmr
duced in Hollywood since Clint Eastwood’s
Uly'izrgiwn. Viewing it this Saturday evening
in the JRC courtyard, underneath the setting
Iowa sun, can do nothing but further bring out
its greatness.

The plot in 3:10 to Yuma, as in most
westerns, moves in a straightforward fashion.
Dan Evans (Christian Bale) is an impoverr
ishcd rancher and a Civil War veteran and Ben
Wade (Russell Crowe) is an outlaw who loots
an armored stagecoach early in the movie.
Without wasting too many words on details,
Evans basically agrees to hold Wade to make
some money while they await a train to go to
court in Yuma at 3:10 in the afternoon. Chaos
ensues.

The movie sets itself apart from a generic
runrofrthermill Western through excellent
performances. Bale is one ofthe few screen ace
tors who can convincingly shed the trappings
of modernity. His character is no mere movie
star in costume. With his gaunt, haggard face
and wide, awerstruck eyes he seems to have
stepped out of a daguerreotype or a murder
ballad.

On the other hand, Crowe’s character, the
prodigiously effective outlaw, is a more familiar
creature a sociopath whose twinkling charm
masks both his ruthlessness and perverse inc

tegrity. Bale’s haunted teticence complements
Crowe’s roguish relish rather well, and their
interactions form the selling point ofthe mov-
ie, which seems a bit ironic, as Crowe (from
New Zealand) and Bale (Welsh), are acting in
the quintessentially American format of the
Western

Perhaps the alleAmcrican supporting cast,
comprised ofPeter Fonda, Gretchen Mol, Ben
Foster and Dallas Roberts, help the film still
feel authentic.

3:10 To Yuma skillfully captures the rug-
ged landscape of New Mexico, and James
Mangold's direction is up to the mark as well.
The screenwriter has also deﬁnitely earned his
money by penning the witty dialogue.

Only two factors prevent 3:10 To Yum/l
from being a classic. First, it’s too long. At 117
minutes it goes at least 25 minutes longer than
the original, although it adds nothing substanr
tial to the new version, Second, the script is
rather linear. There's an air of predictability
about the action, and the length only accentu-
ates this drawback.

In all, however, 3310 to Yuma is an excellent
movie that definitely entertains.

ment, critics from many publications ap-
praised the film to be something ofa rare gem.
Regardless of its place in history, the film as—
sures Anderson’s status as an auteur and Danr
iel DayaLewis's virtuosity as an actor.

The plot seems fairly straightforward. At
the turn ofthc century, the ambitious butstrug-
gling silver miner Daniel Flainview (Lewis)
accidentally discovers oil amidst the haggard
deserts and gaunt homesteads ofthe American
West. The movie then follows Plainview’s rise
into fortune and descent into madness as he
slowly Withdraws from the world in building
his empire ofoil.

The interpolation of greed with corruption
seems as old as sin, Furthermore, the trailer
and the title itselfseem to suggest that the film
might be little more than one ofthc innumerr
able cautionary tales concerning money and
corruption. The brilliance of this film arises
from its eccentric and elaborate articulation of
such themes and its selfrconscious design.

The film is based loosely off of Upton
Sinclair's novel Oilf, a book which combines
Sinclair's abilities as both a muckraker and an
eloquent writer and John Huston’s classic ﬁlm
The Treasure D/Sltl‘l'i’l Math-z. It remains well
aware of its roots and the cultural and cine
cmatic contexts it inhabits and departs from.
As a resulr,l believe someone may dismiss the
breadth and ambition ofthc movie as preten-
tious.

However. the visual and auditory experir
encc that I felt was well worth the 150 minutes
1 set aside during Hell Week, and could not,
at least to me, be defined by its inﬂuences or
self~consciousness

Beyond Anderson’s clearrheaded direc
tion and Lewis’s intimidating performance,
the film also succeeds with its emotionally taut
and unnerving score by Radiohead's lead gut

tarist, Johnny Greenwood. Most noteworthy
might also he Robert Elswit s austere cinema-
tography. whose long tracking shots endow
the film with a quality that could be likened to
metaphysical artwork.

In presenting seemingly naturalistic fig-
ures, objects and actions in a controlled scenic
space, the universe depicted in szre Will Be
Blood appears mysteriously still, clegiac, once
removed from the historic'rzcd Wild West.

I think 771th Will Be Blood is a fine film
to end the semester with. The final 30 min-
utes of the film might be the most comedic
and tragic sequence ofevents l have ever seen.
Regardless of whether you view the movie as
a political allegory or just a joke (with quite
possibly the most elaborate and psychologi-
cally involved set up to date), this movie asks
for a reaction.

I Tampop’o
(i 985)

Unique film combines
West and East in love

lfyou love crazy ‘805 style cinematography,
old westerns, weird sex scenes, and rnmen soup
(among a plethora of other Japanese foods),
then you’ll love Tampopo,

Thc eponymous main character (Nobuko
Miyamoto) owns a ramen shop in Japan and
makes awful noodles. In a style reminiscent of
the Old West, milk-truck drivers Goro (Tsu-
tomu Yamazaki) and Gun (Ken Watanabe of
The Last Samurai) stroll into her restaurant
to rest their weary eyes from along night of
driving and to satisfy their appetites, Their
entrance sets in motion the long chain of vi-
gnettes and adventures that the movie goes
through to eventually transform Tampopo’s
noodles from the bottom to the top ofthc rat
men shop heap.

The ﬁlm as a whole should not be taken
too seriously. Tampopo’s escapades are,for the
most part, adorably absurd, She and Goro pick
up a noodlermaking master by saving an old
man's life, recruit a defeated opponent to help
redecorate the noodle shop, and meet a gang of
“renegade-hobo"goutmer chefs who also help
teach her the secrets of fine ramen,

Their predicamenrs usually end up in their
favor and are at least in good fun. The movie
also includes random interludes that take what
would be dramatic scenarios and infuse them
with culinary ﬂair. Among the many bizarre
and humorous scenes, one intriguing side story
follows a man in a white suit and his mistress
(this is the infamous "egg yolk sex scene").

Tampopo's other fine qualities include the
dialogue, which was never overbearing, hut in-
stead remained light and witty. Though itwas
spoken in Japanese with subtitles. the director
Juzo Itami (who has near-legendary status in
Japan) gets across a quick and humorous tone
that everyone could relate to.

Also, character development was excellent
in the Tampopo storyline and even somehow
surpasses expectations in the short time frame
of the scattered shorts.

The Films committee has organized a sper
cial event for the viewing ofTampopo on Frr
day night at 7:30pm in South Forum. in honor
of this cinematic masterpieces rich apprecia-
tion for fine cuisine, free ramen and tea will be
served to all.
