BYMA'IT ZMimKA

Strolling into Kershaw Hall, one notices a dcpnr
ture from the typical Grinnell dorm. Finger paintings
ndom the walls, the density and quality of door decorae
tions seems greater than usual, and the

. dominant smell is cookies, not last night‘s

Natural Ice.

Welcome to the world of substances
free housing, now entering its fourth year
as part otthe Grinnell culture. Smith Hall
became sub-free in 2004, while Kcrshaw
joined the lanks in 2005. The dorms
remain a haven for some, while sparking
debates about their image in the campus
communiotnrsteyear housing procedures,
and what “subsfrec” really means.

Different factors draw people into subs
free housing. hie idea ofa culture without drugs or alco
hol was appealing to smith Annex resident Nahila Mirza
’11.“Personnlly,l don’t drink or smoke, so Iwouldn't like
being around alcoholics and smokers," she said,

«Beyond the lack ofdrinking and smoking, students are
attracted to suhsfree dorms forvarious reasons.“lt ms the
community feel of my friends over here that drew me to
it,"said Allie Greenberg'll), an SA on Kersliaw third.

Ben Hallibunon '03, however, drew on his past CX’
perience to choose to live in Kershaw during his senior
year, “After coming back from abroad, 1 had a single in
Cowles, and'itwasjust a mess,”he said.“'l'he lounge got
wrecked every other night I just wanted some peace
and quiet."

Brynn Leland ’09 Lived in Smith last year but left this
year because he had “moved past the subaftec stage.”l-lc
admits he “drew in to sub—free mostly to get a triple,"

although being subefree was part of his motimrion.
Suhefree, in casual conversation,often gets a negntive
stigma for being dull and antisocial,“lt’s true that there is

a stigma about that, which is sad,"Leland said.
However,Hal.lihurton didn’t notice much of a negative
attitude towards sub-free in the campus
community. “The only crap I get about
living in subsfrce is that [friends] can't
.bring over a bottle ofwine when we’re

having a parry," he said,

Greenberg tried to dispel the com
mon campus stigma that sub-tree
residents weie quiet and dull. “Sub-free
does not mean serfree or quiet,” she
said. “People here are very crazy~we
just don't need alcohol to be crazy,"

Hallibutton said that he had not
imagined the boisterousness.“instead or

drinking, they're playing dodgeball in the hall—which is
more annoying in some ways."

Sub~free dorm pol iéy

Smith and Kcrshaw house 141 students between
them, yet ﬁll up very quickly with ﬁrsteyears. According
to Emily Wax’o9, a member ofhousing committee, one
third of incoming ﬁrst years request sub-free, a number
that drops signiﬁcantly for upperclassmen. “Doubles for
sophomores usually have a hard time ﬁlling up,"wat said,
although singles tend to be popular. _

Due to possible concerns of too many incoming
students requesting sub-free, changes to the sub-free ape
plieation process have been discussed heavily this year in
SGA Housing Committee. According to Wax, a section

 

has been added to the ﬁrst-year housing torm explaining
in more detail what sub~free housing is. “We'll see if this
new form actually cuts the people who use sub-free by
explaining exactly what subsfree means,"Wax said.

She hoped that reducing the number of applicants
would help balance out age ratios in the dorm.“ltwould
be awful. I think, to make all of those [sophomore]
doubles ﬁrstsyear," she said. “You suddenly have a ﬁrst-
year dorm."

For those who do not make it into a subsfree dorm,
unothcinl clustering of sub-tree students has been praee
ticed in the past; Norris Fourth has been an example in
past years, and Greenberg spent her ﬁrst year there,“Those
don’t always work out as planned," she said, noting that
it ended up “very subefull."

The idea of ofﬁcially creating subvftee ﬂoors has
bccn tossed around, but Wax, a former HSC, explained
concerns about usage ofthc common space.

Questions have been raised on how suberree one has
to be to live in sub-free dormsAccording to Wax, subs
free is not binding but based a contract otgood faith, and
there is no enforcement “apart from glares.”

“lfyou draw into thatand you're not actually suberree,
people will look down on you," Leland said. He said that
there were problems with people keeping alcohol in the
fridge in his dorm lastyear.

Greenberg mentioned some initial conﬂicts on her
ﬂoorwilh people who did drink outside ofKershaw.“They
wouldn't even be anywhere near tipsy, and some of the
ﬁrsteycars would be freaking out,” she said.

Mitzn, like many others, did not mind when her
doormates went out and drank elsewhere. “They go out,
they have their ﬁm, they sometimes come back drunk,
but they don't make a mess,” she said.
