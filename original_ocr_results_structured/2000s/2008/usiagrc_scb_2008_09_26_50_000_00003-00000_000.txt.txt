College to study campus attitudes about diversity

BY]! M MALEWITZ
Over the course of the next year,
Grinnell College will develop and conduct a
survey to investigate whether changes need to
be made to improve the campus climate with
respect to diversity. The
pioject, in which the col—
lege will work with private
eonsulring ﬁrm Rankin 8c
Associates, will address rhe
openness otrhe campus' en-
vitonmcnt to everyone on
campus, including students,
start and faculty.
The 2004 Strar
rcgic Planning. in which a
group composed of admins
istration, faculty and trustees
set goals for strengthening
the College. emphasized increasing diversity
at Grrnnell. The plan called {or “allrcamplis
discussions about improving the classroom
climate and the overall campus climate with
regard to diversity." While lasr semester's anri-
queer acrs added urgency to the survey, ir rvas
not the impetus for the survey.
President Russell K, Osgood said that
increasing and accommodating diversity has
been a longrterin objective for the college, As

an example, Osgood pointed to the increased
number in students of color on campus in the
past decade.
The snrdy began the first week of
September when Rankin 8c Associates met
wrtlr 15 fact-ﬁnding groups.
The groups understanding of
Grinncll campus culture will
inform the creation of sur
vey questions, as mcmbcrs of
Rankin chssociarcs gain an
inside perspective on life and
diversity at Grinnell.. “1 am a
believei that [choosing quesr
tions] is not something I can
do as an outSider,"Sue Rankin
said, who is leading the con—
sulting team at Grinnell along
with hei associate, Stefani

Elena Bernal ’94

Bjorkland.

With the approval of the Internal Re-
view Beard, a college committee rhar decides
on which research proposals rho college will
pursue, rhe survey will rhen be made available
to all students, faculty and start, Atrer spring
Break, the data Will be collcctcd and analyzed
by Rankin 8c Associates, who will prepare a
report to be presented to the campus commir
nitv.

According to Osgood, Rankin dc Associr
ates, administrators and the campus con-is
munity will determine methods of change on
campus. “Whenever we do a survey, we don't
do exactly what they
suggest." Osgood said,

“We take it into ace
count and talk with
people on campus."

Berna] and Rankin
agree that what those
methods will look like
is impossible to detei-
mine uiitil the survey
is conducted.

While the
college has made
progress, Elena Ber»
rial, special assistant
to the president for
diversity 8c achievement, feels there is more
work to he done.

“There’s a lot ofgood talk around dis
versity, and then rlrcre still seems to be things
that are broken . ifthe walk and the talk are
matching, rhcrc s a problem,"Bernal said. Es
sentially. the campus climate assessment pro
cess is to help us identify and to narrow the
gaps between the core values for diversity and

the lived experience around campus around i5r
sues ofdiffeiencc."

“Oftcntimcs you identify things that
people had no idea was going on,” Bernal said

of the survey process. At the same time, she
added. “them are some things that we thought
for sure were going on that might be lore."

Rankin’s other clients, including schools
such as Carleton College and Iowa State Uni-
versity, have taken actions ranging from rhc
creation of new courses to the creation ofncw
departments or resource centers.

Students create website to share DVDs on campus

With numerous DVDs ﬂoating around college campuses, it

This summer, Rosenberg, rdong with David Carson
’11 and Yale student Dan Tureza, founded the movie
sharing website Penguinsliare.eoni.The site, which acts
as a platform for stutlentrtorstudent lending and bore
rowing of movies on Grinnell‘s campus, launched with
the beginning ofthe current academic year.

Users can sign up with a Glinnell e-mail address
and lisr the movies they own. After rhar, they are tree
to browse other users' DVD collecrions and request
to borrow speciﬁc DVDs. “I've let others borrow my
DVD, 10 T/iing: II-[nfc About You." said Guillaume Dc
Perlinghi'll‘And l myselfborrowed Tarzan,"

Rosenberg and Tutcza came up wrth the idea tor
Pcnguinshaie.com over the summer of 2007, when
Rosenberg was entering his first year at Grinnell. Ac-
cording to Rosenberg, he and his friends were brain-

once the domain name was in place, Rosenberg and Carson
said they wcnt ro rvork cnsurrng that the web e would both
look professional and have users ricndly qualir
tics.

With Penguinshare.com only three weeks
into existencc, it is still too early to determine its
success. Many students just use the website to see
who else has certain DVDs and not necessarily
request to borrow it drrecdy through the site. “If
there’s a movie I'm dying to see," said Ellie Deal
'11,“it'd be great to be able to log on and see ifonc
of my neighbors owns it.“

Pengurnsharecom has already spread to 17
other colleges and has garnered over 400 users so tar. “It looks
like with the iiglit effort and marketing, this would be more
successrul at bigger schools,“ Rosenberg said. “The problem is
we are three college students with full course loads."

But with the economy in a tailspin and college students tryr

Rosenberg and Tui'cza had to come with a
