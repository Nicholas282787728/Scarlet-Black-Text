Bill/e! r pi edurlion of Carmen REBECCA TAYLOR

There is always 1 moment in 1 public Perfots
mince when everything teeters ou 1 precipice,. .1
moment when the audience's vacillation between
incredulousness and belief begins to stabilize in
in unequivocal choice, 1 choice rh1t will uItir
mately determine the apparent success or failure
of the act.

When the St. Petersburg State Academic
Ballet Thentre performed it Roberts Theme on
Saturday night, this moment came at the start of
the second hultwhen 1 member ofthe campany
pumped much-needed dynamism into 1 hitherto
l u k e w :l r m
show with an
electric pet-
foimance of
the bullflght-
er Escamillo
(Sergey Davi~
dov).

His shiny
crimson and gold costume added pizzazz to his
charmingly lieentious potti-1y1l or the matador.
The eyes of the female dancers who surrounds
ed him sparkled for the ﬁrst time rh1t evening.
Childrlike amazement and unabashed grins
flashed across the faces ofrhe spectators.

The show started with Don Jose’ (Vladimir
Dorokhin) whose face recalled, ever so slightly,
that of the figure skatei Evgeni Plusheuko. His
inﬁnite muscles and Baryshnikovesque leaps made
thcawrgoers swoon (ruther loudly 1r times).

Carmen (Alisa Sveshnikova) then entered
from the back ofthe thc1tte Walking up the aisle,
she then turned and passed the front row starring
down the audience members in 1 c11cul1ted pan.
We got rl ie pointithis 1vom1n could glvt: n .u1u
ecstasy, only to castrate him 1 second l1ter without
tlinching, Her sturdy hur slim form added ﬁre to
her grsce.

St. Petersburg Ba'l Iet

February I 2008

The two dancers reached exciting
heights in the ﬁrst 1ct during their love
making temp in almost transparent tan
rights. it Wis however in the second act, afr
ter the comma of Escamillo, th1t Don José
and Carmen showed off undeniable charm
and bravado. ‘

In the fantastic last number, the chorus .
ordnnccrs lined up in rows as the principnl
characters took turns gr1cing center sr1ge
with physical ﬁreworks. The tone of the
music and the fast pace of the dancing elic-
ited a feeling
similar to a
Baz Luhrman
number—an
elated,bouncy
reeling.

W l t h o u t
being 1 cons
noisseur of
ballet, I could not help hut notice small miss
rukes, timing mix-ups 1nd fumbles. mainly
by the young d1ncers in the chorus, who
lacked physic1l 1nd mentnl intensity. There
was one dancer in particular who rubbed
me the wrong way. With her gaze forever
turned downward, the dancer teed her way
around the space like 1 wilted peony.

But despite 1 few weak links, the show
stole rat meme/ll. The 1udience, who packed
Roberts Theatre, celebrated the dancers and
the radiant artistic director (Yury Petukhov)
with a standing ovation.

Perhaps the ballet did not send emotion-
al volts through my system, but don‘t get me
wrong: the glitter of Davidov 1nd Petukhov
taught us an important lesson—“style al—
ways wins out in the end."
