is different than high school softball," said Veronica Rcav'ls '11. "The hlrrers are
more aggressive."

Last year the Pioneers went sale with a conference record ofssx and railed

Water polo requires a level ofendurance that ls matched by
only a handful of other $potts.With the possibility oflcaving the
starters in for the entire game all but impossible, at certain level
of depth is required, “It's like soccer, but it's got the aggressive
ness of rugby and football," said Man Gunman ’09. “And there’s
water!"

The Black Sheep, the women‘s water polo team, has yet to
lose a game this season, and have won all their games by more
than five goals.

this weekend,"sald Gunman. “We have been working extra hard
because it would be great to represent Grinnell at the national
level.”

If the Black Sheep are able to will conference {cl the ﬁrst
time in their history, they will be beaded to nationals.That being
said, they have come a long way from their humble beginnings.

Grinnell went two years wrthout a women’s mlel polo team.
All that changed in 2004, when renewed interest in the sport
provided a full roster and a triumphant return to the league. This
return also brought a new name and identity to the team. “We
were suspended for two years, but we came back, we were the
Black Sheep." said Brianne Benness ’08. “Plus it was a name of
a brewery."

As a club team, the
Black Sheep do not at
tually have a coach to
make sure that practices
are efficient. The team,
however, ls able to come
together and support one
and another in making
sure that practices are
beneficial. Furthermore,
the Black Sheep face an
additional challenge in
that practice time is limited; as a club sport they can only pmctlee
when they find open times in the pool.

Even with those restrictions, this year's team may be the
strongest Grinnell has ever seen. “This year's team ls by rat the
best team since l have been here," said Guttman. “Never before
have I been on a team where everyone performs so well."

While the VVlld Turkeys. the men's water polo team, have
gained prominence with their second place in nationals last se-
lnestcr, the women have yet to teach that notoriety,

Both teams compete ln the Heardrlntl Conference, which
has a different mixtulc of tellms than the traditional MVVC in
which our sports teams competednstead, the Heartland oncoma
passes Knox, Lindenwoorl, llllnois Wesleyan, St. Mary’s, Iowa
State and Carleton. The Black Sheep's toughest competition
may come trorn an undereaterl Carleton squad who also hope
to reach nationals.

A nutnbersone ranking, however-,will be on the Black Sheep's
side as they head into pool at Iowa state University this week»
end,“l really hope to go to nationals this year,"sald Benness.“lt's
in Oregonl”

Even if the team docs not manage to reach nationals after
this weekend, they have come a long way from where it was four
years ago. “This season has been wonderful," said Guttmnn. " l
have never seen such dedicatlon and hard work"

”We were suspended for two
years, but when we tame bark
we were the Blark Sheep... plus it
was the name ofn brewery”
