The dos and don’ts of prospie season

Jim Malewitz ’09 lays down guidelines for insuring that prospies enjoy their time here

Have you recently found yourseltstroliing
about campus without the need to wear cloths
ing that makes you resemble the marshmallow
man?

Do you dorkily get a kick out the fact that
you can new exercise your mental protractor to
ﬁnd the most direct route from your dorm to
the dining hall across the snowlcsa grass?

Have you
begun think-
ing that living
in Iowa is not
entirely depress
ing.>

If you've
answered yes to
some of these questions, you are most likely
experiencing the commencement of a Mids
western spring.

Besides creating in us a greater urge to skip
class in order to acquire that essential base
can (or base burn for my {aireskinned fellows)
what does this mean?

It's prospective student limeﬁto the maxl

April's pleasant climate shirt corresponds
with Grinnells annual inﬂux of accepted stu—
dents.

Thus it is now the time to Showcase our
campus in its most heautirul and least gloomy
state.

So how can we best act as ambassadors for
our hcloved college?

Since everyone enjoys ﬁlling in, try con-
viu ug prospective students that you share.
or will at rhc very least tolerate their political
values.

Undoubtedly you will come across many

prospies that embody the same liberal views
which attracted a large percentage ofour stu-
dent body.

But what about studcnts falling on the
opposite end or the spectrum? The follow
ing is a list Dos and Don'ts (as per stereotype)
to guide our interactions with prospective
Grinncllians who may double as prospective

political minorities
on campus.

1. Talk about
where you were on
9/11.

2. Let them
know that the Creds
it crisis has no ettcct on the price of campus
housing.

3. Make sure to wear a
ﬂag pin on your lapel at all

symbol ortruc patriotism.

4, Initiate a conversation
winch casually brings up
the fact that Grinnell E007
nomics protesscr Jack Murri
was an economic adviser to
Reagan—they love that guy;
apparently he was pretty
dreamy hack in the 1940s.

5. Make it Chuck Noiris
joke incorporating the Clintons’ luck oi that-
acrer into the assekickmg punch line.

6. Be sure to point out that Grinnell docs
house a chaptcr of Campus Republicans,
showcasing our political opcueinintiedness.

Don‘t:

1. Laugh while carrying out the last item
on the “Do" list.

2 Say anything ahour Dick Clieneyihcr
cause you know you can't say anything nice at
all.

3. Try to convince them of the existence of
a CRmpuS’WldC. water conservation program
called “shower buddies” (uue story—they get
a hit twitchv).

4. Show them the booklist from your Intro
to Global Development studies class last year.

5. Let them near overactive members of
Campus Democratsiwc want them to feel
welcomed. not guilty.

6. Let them near the cross country team.

So there you have
it. By following the
preceding simple
rules, you will be sure
to make sure that our
campus appeals to a
much wider domes
graphic.

By doing so, we
will improve our al-
ready stellar iecord of
political tolerance. But
if for some stiange rea—
son the items on this
list prove inetrcctivc,jiisr watch an episode of
Total chuest Live with the difﬁcult prospie.

I'm ptctrysurc that all high school kids still
love that show.
