When most people think of female friendships, the ﬁrst
images that come to mind consist of pillow ﬁghts, gossip, cell
phone conversations, and multiple viewings of Mean Girls.
For seniors Soﬁa Becker and Brianne Benncss, being friends
revolves around a more unusual activity: water polo. Benness
and Becker, who are roomrnatcs,are the senior stars ofGtinncll's
club team.

When considering their history, it is easy to realize how
these two make such an eitective part. They were both serious
ﬁgure skaters for several years as children. Then. sometime in
the middle of high school, both girls, (who were more than
a thousand miles apart), took up the swimming When they
came to college, their love for the pool evolved into water polo.

“it was a strange transition," recalls Benness, “going from
ﬁgire skating to water polo." This is because water polo,
according to the women of the Black Sheep Women's Water
Polo Team, happens to be a particularly violent endeavor.

Take for instance one memorable cxpcrience the two friends
shared: Becker, who has been through one concussion, was in
a particularly competitive mood during a mundane section of
practice. Benness describes the incident: ”Soﬁa gave me a fat
lip during warm up. She was shooting at the net,..trying a
really hard shot where you aim for the net, and she hit me in
the lipl" Luckily, the incident did not stiﬂe Soﬁa and Brinnne's
friendship, though it altered Brianne a dose ofinjury herself.

By the time they were upperclassmen, the contrast between
their ﬁgure skating years and water polo couldn’t have been
more drastic. Benncss recounted a strategic move that Becker
had developed throughout the years; Benncss says that Becker
makes noises that resemble a sheep to intimidate the goalie.

Apparently, this tactic has been reserved for practice, as both
girls have their doubts about how eirecrivc it would he during
regulation. "She does it when we play s-Alivc [a game where
players take shots at the goal,and whoever misses has to be the
goalie]," said Benness, “And Soﬁa makes sheep noises. Baring.
She Baas. They aren't normal sheep noises. They are a psychotic,
drugged-out sheep!"

it seems like such strategies have paid err. Becker and

Bel-mess, since the time they were freshman, have turned a
lackluster program into a quality team that routinely wins. “We
were really had our ﬁrst year," recalls Becker.

Since water polo is a club sport, the two girls have enjoyed
a lack of authority, which not only has enabled them to play
under less pressure, but has let them partake in team activities
that don’t quite involve mler polo. For instance. the team
will soon be going to Skate Castle in Newton, where they
are excited about an unusual opportunity to roller skate. The
women's insistence on making time for diﬁ’ercnt, completely
random hobbies has also been a perpetual aspect of their close
friendship.

In addition to regularly romping their opponents in matches
and skating, Becker and Benness have an extensive and
demanding schedule outside of the pool. Benness is a double

This past weekend, the school saw an inﬂux of capes, foam
swords and mock amputations as battles raged on Mac Field A
yearly convention of Grinnell students, alumni, and members
from other realms swarmed Grinnell as the college played host
to Dagorhir’s (Dag) Field Day. “Field day is just an excuse to in—
vite a bunch of people down, so we can get together and fight big
battles." said Hugh Potter ’10.

The group was larger than any general Dag practice or com-
petition. Another Dag group, also known as a "realm,” dmve to
Grinnell from Ames to participate in the event. In addition, Field
Day is comparable to other sports alumni weekends, as dozens of
alumni trekked back to Grinnell to don costume and wield swords.
“We can pull anywhere up to 40 people," said Potter.

A team with a lot of spunk. Grinnell's Dagorhu club stands
somcwhcre between sport and art Competition and athleticism
are integral to proper participation in Dag, creating a fastrpaccd
contest, or in other words, a sport. But at the same rime,the role-
playing elements and otherworld qualities of Dag durei much
from the unimaginativc real-lire mushy-level sports,

The physical aspect ofDag comes in its fighting nanire. Play-
ers urilize a variety of weapons, all covered in protective foam to
avoid injury or extreme pain'l‘hc weapons themselves vary from
ranged items, such as bows and arrows, to unique melee items, ljkc
maces, and all weapons are homemade.

Fighting styles are varied, highly individual and depend gready
on each player's strengths and weakncsses After hurting her right
wrist her fust year of participating in Dag, Erika Graham '10
switched styles. “I fight sword-board now," said Graham, “which
means I fight leftrhanded With a sword and a shield,"

But beyond just ﬁghting, Dag functions as somewhat of a
hobby group as well, facilitating role-playing and fantastical inter
actions. Players are assigned names and also participate in building
their own weapons and armor, mostly designed oer ofa series of
plans Dag owns

A group ormastcrs help keep the Dag group and games run
ning and are appointed every year during Field Day “We have
masters that make sure the weapons are safe," said Potter. From
refereeing games to helping with building weapons, Masters reln~
force the structure of Dag.

Though Field Day has come and gone, as the weather gets
warmer, students wandering around campus will definitely see
more of Dag as they play afternoons on Mac Field and Forum
Beach.
