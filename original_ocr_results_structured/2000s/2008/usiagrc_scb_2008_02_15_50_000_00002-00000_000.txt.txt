SEC challenges Grinnell to use less energy

by CLAIRE REEDER
Grinnell students usually are competitive and like
to WI". But when it comes to energy ethereney, it seems they
couldn't care less.

SGA Student Environmental Committee (SEC) has en-
tered Grrnnell college in the National campus Energy Chal-
lenge (NCEC) fol the month or February, a contest among
colleges, universities and high schools from across the country
to see which school can must reduce their
energy usage in a month. SEC is sponsor-
ing campus-wide events and themed weeks
to promote the Energy Challenge and re»
sponsible conservation habits.

“There are so many simple things you
can do to save energy," said SEC chair
Becky Lyons '10.

To promote energy saving, the commits
tee has teamed with Free the Planet (FTP)
to host a number of sexually suggestive
events. Last week's “Do It In the Dark"Harris Party turned off
more lights than typical parties; other weekly themes include
“Shower with a Friend” to encourage responsible water use and
“Pull lt Out" as a reminder to unplug computers, power strips,
and other electronics when not in use.

Grinnell frequently enters contests like the NCEC or Re—
cyclemania, which has been held over the past several years, but,
despite its reputation as a progressive, environmentally—aware
institution, Grinnell rarely wins. Compared to peer institutions
such as Oberlin (named the most eco—t’ricndly campus by the
Sierra Club), Macalester and Carleton (both of which already
utilize wind power), Grinnell has the greatest ﬁnancial resource

”It’s really hard for us to thallenge
the notion that we’re not that
environmental/y progressive here.”

es, yet continues to lag behind in competitive assessments of
cnvimnmcntalism,

“It’s really hard for us to challenge the notion that
aver rot tharem-ironmcnrally progressive here,"said FTP Cos
Chair Caitlin Vaughan '10. “If we really want to cut down on
our carbon footprint,we need to invest in technology."

The administration is currently making efforts to make the
school more environmentally friendly including a wind turbine
project by the Board ofTrustees and the
signing of the Emissions Reduction Pro-
posal by college President Russell Osgood.
The school is experimenting with Dorm
Envrronmental Coordinators and the ad-
dition orrecycling bins in each dorm room
in Hannibal Kershaw, Haines, and Langan
Halls.

Despite these ettorrs, Lyons said stu-
dent apathy proves to be the most difﬁcult
problem.“1t’s hard to get students inspired,
to make them recognize all the lrttle ways that energy is waste
ed," Said Lyons. ”lcicle lights in the dining hall, or lights left
on in academic buildings or the ﬁreplace room after hours [all
waste eiiethJ,” she said.

Regardless orhnal standing in the NCEC, Vaughan
hopes that the data gathered from the contest can be used to
evaluate where Grinncll stands in terms of “green" efforts, and
as motivation for future projects.

“I'd consider this contest an unofﬁcial audit, where we
are, and maybe what we can do better," she said. “It’s kind ofa
contest against ourselves."

portunities to help accommodate the large amount of appli-
cants, according to Assistant Director of Off—Campus Study
Neela Nandyal.

Bright said that students who are interested in the interti-
ship component of the program but do not receive one have
been given other options for studying abroad. These options
include the Grinnell-iri-Wnshington or the Obcrlinein-Lonr
don programs, both otwhich provide internships,

According to Bright, students who are approved by Grinnell
to study abroad but not accepted to the Gtinnellrianondon
program will get help from the OffrCampus study Office to
find another program for the same semester that students find
acceptable.

Tetenbaum said he would consider applyrng to other p|o~
giams,but because their application deadlines are soon, he will
have little time to ﬁnd another program and complete an ap-

Unique Bexley '10, who also applied to Grinnell-in-Lon-
don, said that she had not yet made changes to her study abroad
plans. Bexley said she may consider studying abroad her senior
year, but because of her four-year plan, she may not be able to
study abroad if she is not accepted to Grinnell—in-London.

Despite this year’s number otapplicanrs, the on campus

) Bright said that the ofﬁce does plan to address part of
the problem by creating better communication with students
that the program is competitive, so that students realize from
the beginning that they may have to go on another program.
“VVht-thcr this is just ill] anomaly or a trend we’ll see," said
Bright.
