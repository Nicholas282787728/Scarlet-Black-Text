At the final game of the Grinnell men's basketball seas

“Goggles! Gogglesl" The target of their heckling is a player on
the opposite team who rs sporting a pair of prescription atl‘r

Grinnell community and are not directly afﬁliated with the Cole

the court reads, “Cheer for your team,
not against the visitors", the basketball
devotees take pride in the creativity of
their taunting.

Fans Nate “Gtizz” Lindsey ‘09 and

favorite visitor pet names have been

Volleyball player Liz Davis ’11 (who wore the letter ‘1") says
she comes out to the games to support friends on the team.
"They get the busrness done," she said. "They’re awesome guys,
obviously."

Other members of the audience include Barb Pettigrew,
basketball fan and mother of player Kale Knlsley ’11. While
Pettigrew enjoys the enthusiasm of the fans, she feels that
sometimes fans become negative. "1 just don't like it when they
turn their backs on the other team when they’re introduced,"
said Pettigrew. “It’s poor sportsmanship."

some Grinnell students would also prefer that fan support
stayed a little more positive. “It can definitely be fun but other
tirrres they cross the line,” said Emma Willenborg ’11. “It's not
necessarily a good portrayal of the student body as a whole."

A majority of the fans, however, seem to feel that the cheer-

opinion: “Ali's fair in love, war, and Grinnell basketball."

Tennis seeks competition outside of MWC

After a somewhat disappointing see
1055 to nationally ranked Graceland Unis
versity last Sunday, rhc Grinnell man's tcnc
nis team is preparing for a full season or
play both in and outside ofthc Midwestern
Conference.

Within tltc conference, the team must
defend its {ourcycat title from other teams
in the region. The first
conference match ofthc
season takes place today
against the University
of VVisconsin-Oshkosh
at coe College. There
will be a split squad on
Sunday. with half of the
team traveling to Ne-
braska to play Nebraska
Wesleyan University and Bethel Univcrsity
while the other half of the team plays car-
roll College and Augustana College on the
home courts.

Although the team has gained assets
such as strong new talent while maintains

”i feel like our program is getting
stronger every year W/li/e our
abi/ity is improving, our (all/er-
ente stays the same.”

ing experienced playcr-s, the players have
found that ltr order to rcnrain competitive
they must play matches with more chalc
longing noncconferencc teams.

“I feel like our program is getting
stronger every year.“ sard Ryan Lyci'la ’08
“While our ability rs improving, our corr-
tcrcncc stays the same."

As a t, the team will play more
matches outsrdc of the
conference this spring.
The team will compete
against Gustavus Adolc
phrrs College and Carleton
College, both nationally
ranked teams, on March 8
and 9, respectively.

“It’ll be a real test,"said
Nate Fox ’08 about the
team's upcoming nonsconference games.
He anticipates that this year's team will be
more careful not to let close matches slip
through their ﬁngers. “Hopefully we can
turn some of those 4-5 losses to 5-4 victo-
tics," he said

One way the team is improving its game
is by developing rts new talent. Freshman
Juan Carlos Perez has been an exciting ads
dition to the team as he qualiﬁed for the
quarterﬁnals or the ITA Midwest Regions
a1 competition in the fall and is currently
ranked 10th in the region. Felipe Bau ta,
Perez’s coach betor-c entering college, ' an
'02 alum [might by Coach Andrew Hamil-
ton. and was the frrst Gi‘inncllian to qualify
for the national tournament. Last year,
Dan LaForrntaine '09 became the college's
second national tpralifrer. “I hope I‘ll be the
third one," said Perez.

The top 13 players on the team will
travel to Orlando, Florida over spring break
to play matches against teams ranging front
Cornell Univcrsity, a Division I team, to
Division III teams from across the nation.
Coach I'Iamilton believes that this trip not
only brings the team together, but is key
for later Victories. “It’s a nice opportunity
in the early part of the season to get valu-
able experience, which is a building block
for our success."
