On the evening of Jan 21, students and faculty gatheied in
the JRC to commemorate the life of Martin Luther King Jr.
The highlight of the e -ning was an original recording of his
1967 address “Remaining Awakc Dining a Revolutioifwhich
was delivered 40 years ago during a week of symposia called
“Liberal Arts in a World ofChnngc."

As the audience listened to the address
that King gave just live months before his
death, a repeating slideshow displayed pair
gnant images ot‘the time highlighting racism
and the civil rights movement, Some of the
slides even showed King during his visit to
the college as well as shots of Louis Arm
strong and Ralph Ellison, both ofwhonr had
participated with King in that week's convo-
cation.

lu his speech, King speaks about the darn
gtrs orheeoniing too comfortable with racial and religious bigt
otry or of becoming too stagnant to act for change “Human

progress," he said, “never rolls in on the wheels ot‘rnevitabrlrty."

For some of the audience, the presentations history lesson
was still relevant. “It’s pretty awesome that he was here and
that so much still applies," said Grace Marengo saachcz ’10
after attending the presentation. “Everything still pertains to

”A comment! heard from alot

of people afterwards was how

re/evanr the speech was with the

/taq war and tom/justice issues.“

our world today:

Nkcmditim Offer '09, a member of Concerned Black Stu»
dents who was present at the event also found Kings speech
relevant. “A comment I heard from a lot of people afterwards
was how relevant the speech was with the linq war, and social
justice issues,” he said

In addition to the speech, the evening also featured hum

dreds of luminaries covered with photos of
King,somc ofwh'ich I luded lines from the
speech. As the reco g played, the candles
ﬂickered inside the room and on the cement
pathways leading from Mae Field to the
JRC.

Dean ofStudents Kathleen Skelrett and
Rosenfrelcl center Program Director H.
Wayne lVloyel helped organize the event,
which Meyer said gave students “the opt
poitunity to reﬂect and to hear what [King]
actually sounded like."

Oiioi agreed that hearing Kings voice was beneﬁcial, “[Prer
vious symposia events] were from the professor perspective
and alumni perspectives," he ids “It was nice to hear it in the
raw.

Marengo Sanchez was impressed by the speech, but was
taken aback that only about two—thirds of the chairs in JRC
101 were filled. She sard,“l’m surprised that more people didn’t
come, but it was ieally nice with the candles and everything."

 

Campus Pub

from p. 1
Bauman. A Budweiser sign imprinted with Bauman‘s face will
hang on the wall.

Lylc’s will serve food and drinks mostly unavailable else
where on campus including mozzarella sticks, Ben and Jerry's
ice cream, French flies and onion rings. Beverages served will
include soda, beer and Bacaldi products, all sold in bottles.

Students, faculty and stafthave largely reacted positively to
the creation ofthe pub, and its student organizers say they are
eager to see all members of the Grinnell community utilizing
the space.

Some students had expressed concern that a campus pub
would take away business from local bars and discourage stu-
dents from socializing oft-campus.

But Jeff Sinick ’09, who has solved on the Pub Committee
since Tom Crady oversaw its inception in fall 2006, said that
local vendors were not at all hostile to the idea.

“None of the owners of hats in (Own said they'd have a
problem with [the pub]"wlien the Pub Committee approached
them with the idea, he saidThe same was true for Bob's U",
derground managers, according to srnrck.

Grinnell’s last campus pub closed in 1934,jirst after the tra-
tional minimum drinking age was raised to 21. The previous
one, located in Bob's current location, was known as a place

where students, faculty and staff all gathered together.

A standing pub board, composed of three students, one
other faculty member, a representative of the Trustees, and
pub advisor and Associate Dean Sheree Andrews will replace
the old Pub Committee.Thc pub board. Andrews said, will be
“handSrowahen it comes to dayrtorday management, persons
nel and ordering decisions and assume responsibility for more
longrterm decisions.

The project has seen tremendous student involvement
throughout, said Andrews. “The thing that‘s so exciting is that
it's student-run," said Andrews. Students taking the lead in
choosing color schemes, layout, decor and staff. Pub commits
tee membcrs taste-tested beer and snack choices.

The Pub Committee originally said the pub would begin
operation after fall break oflast semester, but tr rg, licensing
and construction delays pushed back the opening. ‘All the way
along it was a huge learning experience," Andrews said.

The ﬁnal word on the new pubs existence and funding lies
with the Trustees, and Slnlck hopes that its first few months
will prove its value to the college community.

“This is an important semester," he said, “so that next year
we can say to the Trustees that [the pub] is a positive thing
for Grinneli, that it's something people enjoy.”
