Student Staff

terns collegial nature.

Other changes are not official yet, such as expanding the
role orthe SA in opening and closing residence halls and adds
ing paid student assistants to help RLCs with administrative
duties,which Greene wrote will not go into effect next year.

That last point was particularly contentious among SAs
and other students. Toby I<athan ’10, an SA in Younkcr Hall,
said that paying student staff members would be detrimental
to selfrgovernnnce because the position would shirt to regulate
students, and would be more similar to a “resident assistant,”
RA, than an SA.

“By [creating paid staff positionslv you are elevating stu-
denrs above their peers," Kathan said. “Thi is a culture that
they are creating now, that has the potential to really snowball
into big changes."

According to Katie Lulu. CND RLC, assessing ﬁnes would
not be included in the SA or proposed “paid assistant" job der
scription.

”They already help with opening move in so some or it is
just getting them to help with move out, not necessarily as-
sessing room ﬁnes or anything, but being more active in the
process,” Lau said. “I think it would be determined by the RLC,
what they would need help with, but they wouldn’t be assessing
fines or anything like that."

Greene said he understands the general arousal of conccln
that accompanies the addition of a paid position to student
start. “I know people are concerned about selrsgovernance be—
ing eroded or getting people who want a traditional setaip with
an RA," Greene said. “That won’t happen here. The student
start position works here. so why would you want to change
something that works,"

However. Jamie Stomberg'os said she thinks these changes
would hurt the culture ofsclfrgovctnancc. “I feel that selfrgow

ernanee can't be a policy once these things are enacted selfs
governance is about students trusting each other, respecting
each other, being comfortable talking with one another about
what’s troubling themibeing able to communicate,"Stomhetg
said.

SAs and HSCs interviewed said they were told early in the
year that the administration would be available to “listen to any
concerns or ideas", a sentiment echoed in Greene’s letter. Yet
currently, SAs, such as stomberg, said they believe this comr
mirmcnr has not been a priority.

“I feel like we were led to trust them but by now, most
ofus just fccl bcrrnycd by them." Srombcrg said. “They haven’t
consulted us on anything and ...I feel we should be suspicious
of them because the Lines of communication have been come
pletely shut down."

Kathan, on the other hand, said believes that it has more [0
do with the newness of the administration. “They are just try-
ing to figure out the Grinnell culture. A lot of it isjust that we
need to tell them that even throwing [these ideas] around,even
at an RLC meeting is not acceptable."

L‘rlu said that student staff should have been consulted. Lau
said administrators were already working to increase student
participation, by creating a “Student star; Advisory Commits
tee" that would "have input, especially for hiring the new use
socintc dcan and the new RLCs that we would be hiring next
year,"she said.

Greene also knows that he would nccd to consult the genere
a1 student body betore administering any major changesThcte
would also be the addition of a core group or students, “a stus
dent startadvisory board."

"Naturally, we'd start with student staff because we work
and partner with them already," Greene said. “[Bu't for] bigger

f’°’" P- 2 Will a major international crisis erupt
between India and Pakistan? In 2001 a similar incident nearly
brought the two countries to war. In December of that year,
ﬁve armed gunmen, believed to be Pakistani, stormed the In-
dian Parliament building in New Delhi, killing nine people.
India blamed Pakistan for the attack and demanded that the
Pakistani government take responsibility {or the attacks and
cxtradite 20 alleged terrorists to India. The crisis ended
when President Pervez Musharraf announced that Pakistan
publically condemned such violence and would crack down
on terrorism within the country. While the President did
not agree to adite the alleged terrorists, his actions dees~
calated the crisis nonetheless.

Will the current situation bring the countries to the brink
ofwar? Following the 2001 attack on Parliament, India mar
bilized around 500,000 troops along the lndo-Pakistani bore
der. Given the scale of violence associated with the Mumbai
attacks, it is quite possible that such a mobilization of force
would again occur.

One key difference between the Nov. 2008 attacks and
the 2001 attack, however, is the actions of the current Paki»
stani government. President Zardsri has already made some
progress in addressing some of India's grievances, such as
cracking down on terrorist groups. However, Pakistan is cur-
rently not willing to give in to all ofIndia’s demands, particu—
larly in terms of extradition. An international crisis between
India and Pakistan is quite possible over the next few weeks,
but sudi a crisis is not likely to lead to war as long as Zardari
continues his willingness to take a harder stance against terr
rotisrn in his own country.
