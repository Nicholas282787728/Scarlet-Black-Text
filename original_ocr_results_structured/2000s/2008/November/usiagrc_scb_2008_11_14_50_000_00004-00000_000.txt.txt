Dark as night and nearly as long, T/rcDar/e Kriig/Il is pitched
at the divide between art and industry, poetry and entertains
ment, and goes darker and deeper than any Hollywood movie
based on comic books. Director Christopher Nolan and his
crew ensure that this one will be remembered as nothing short
ofrn epic,

Picking up where Barman Begun ends, we are introduced to
The Joker in a stunning opening heist sequence. It is no secret
that Heath Ledger dedicated his heart, soul and tragically his
life to this role, and it shows on screen, resulting in an iconic
performance that no one will forget. A sclfedcscribed agent of
chaos, the Joker arrives in Gotham abruptly and quickly seizes
control of the city’s crime syndicate and Batman's attention.

Ledger disappears under the character’s white mask and
red leer. The Joker isn't a terrorist, he's simply terrifying iis
lines are highly witty (“Did your balls drop ofo") and his ac—
tions maniacal (the ones in which he makes a pencil “disape
pear,” and “hides" a cell phone are especially memorable). As
he so succinctly describes himself, he is a freak, and a cuieftee
one at that.

On the other hand. Batman (3 visibly buff Christian Bale)
has plenty of problems to deal with. Does his crusade have an
end? can he quit and have an ordinary life? Eventually his
struggle becomes external rather than internal because Nolan
gives him rivals in love (Aaron Eckhart, playing Harvey Dent
or Two Face) and war (The Joker) During a key confrontation
between The Batman and The Joker, The Joker says “What
would I do without you? You coruplete me," summing up the
impeccably complementary nature of the two main characters,
one ﬁghting for control and the other creating havoc.

Harvey Dent, hailed as the "White Knight" of Gotham
City because he nails one criminal after another as the crusad—
ing DA, also happens to be courting Rachel Dawes (Batman’s
Childhoodsweetheart).Dawes is played by Maggie Gyllenhaal, , . _ . g . 2 Africa

Action movies rarely get this good, and the only gripe might"
be the releirtless emotional hammering the movie subjects its
audience to, But the excellent script, peerless performances and
immense entertainment will make you at least respect, if not
enjoy, even that aspect of the movie.

Student creates road-tripping musical

BYBRIAN SHERWIN plays ayouug woman in the musical He saw her male friend (Nate Redman 09) we hear sounds, the numbers maintain a sense of bal-

Have you ever been on a bus and wondered
who the strangers traveling with you were,
or where they were going and why they were
going there? In Brian Cavanagh-Strong's ‘09
Travelm‘r/I Marital in Ont/1U, we get to peek
into the worlds of the strangers who travel
with us and what a strange, beautiful trip it is.

Tim/elm is a tragic yet humorous musical
about a group ofpcoplc travelling on a Greys
hound Bus from Annapolis, Maryland to Don
ver, Colorado. This unprecedented production
premiers tonight at 7:30 in Sebring-Lewis
Hall, and will also be shown on Saturday The
music, lyrics, and story were written by Cat
Vanaghrsu'ong this summer as a culminating
senior Mentored Advanced Project, though
the journey was certainly collaborative.

Last spring, without even writing a note of
music or a line ofdialoguc, Cavanaghestrong
'09 sowed the first seeds for Tram/all when he
met wrth hrs eventual performers and listened
to their voices. “[Brian] did a lot of vocaliza-
tions with us," said Kelly liosworth ’10, who

what worked best' in our voices and wrote the
songs based on our voices."

Piece by piece, the musical cmerged.“1 used
the little musical and thematic ideas that I had
and as the summer went on I was able to pile
them up," CavanagheStrong said. “They grew
on each other. As I talked to my advisot and
the cast, things started to come togetl‘lcrr”

As a culmination of personal effort and
collaboration, Tram/w: runs a gamut of char
acters, emotions, and musical styles.

Tl'ﬂ’l/L'ft’l'l opens up with the passengers
peacefully taking their seats on the bus. How-
ever, tlre happy mood is suddenly torn apart
by a tnisanthropic businessman (Tyson stock
'09) who boards the bus late, He enters bitterly
about the passengers, especially Bosworth’s
character, ofwhom he sings: “Who's the girl,
and why is she so f7 ing happy.> / I bet
underneath her life's real crappy,"

As the bus continues on itsjourney, each of
the other characters also sings ofthcir own per-
sonal journeys. From Boswotth’s character and

about their desires for something more than
friendship. From Agnes (played by Katharine
Jarvis '09), an 87-year-old woman, we learn
that she's suffering from amnesia, believes that
she will see her dead husband in Denver, and
enjoys socivl. “She's kind ofmappropriate, and
i feel like she’s one orthose old people who
says whatever she wants,"jarvis said.

We also go on an LSD trip with Anju (Su—
mana Shatrlstr '10), a young drug addict, an
experience that Cavllnngl’trstrong deﬁnitely
needed to draw on all ofhis musical skills and
imagination to invoke.“I can‘t necessarily speak
to the specifics of an acid trip," cavanagh-
Strong said. “I believe a lot of different things
could happen dnnng one, so using things like
the gong, the military snare drum, and the dift
ferent kind ofstring techniques will hopefully
heighten that experience musically."

To build the audience’s visceral experience
ofthc mustcizl, Tran/wt incorporates an eclec
trc (“IX of instrument throughout (not just

during the acid trip). Despite the diversity of

ance

“The show embraces a fairly wide range
of styles,” said John Rommereim, Music, Car
vanagh—Sttong's adviser for the MAP. “Brian’s
musical voice shines through in each song and
gives the work an admirable unity."

The music and lyrics also serve to bring
the characters together. At each rest stop, the
characters sing about each of his or her own
thoughts; however, at the end of the songs,
they come to the same chorus: ”And I know
these people don't know me. /They might not
care who I am. / But whether or not I like it,
1 know where I’m going. / i know that we are
going to the same end / We are traveling to-
gethel'."

Though sad, the rest of Trace/err contine
ties to remind us of our interconnectedness,
certainly an ambitious project for someone
in their early twenties to attempt, We realize
that we often share the same regrets and fears,
hopes and dreams. Ifonly that stranger sitting
next to us on the bus had a stage to sing on.
