NEW DINING HALL BOWLS: They are sturdier and rounder and allow
students to consume larger helpings of cereal, ice cream, and apple
sauce.

 

 

GUSHERS: Though the fruity ooze in the center is such a delectable
surprise, it is unfortunate when one pops in the bag and you are left
with such a sticky mess.

 

 

HOMEWORK ON ELECTION DAY: Dear professors, it seems unrea-

 

sonable to assign homework to be clone on a night when students
should be focusing on the goings-on outside of Crinnell

Fern Gully review too harsh A limerick for Dining Services

Last week’s review of Fern Gully was unduly
harsh. The ﬁlm was incommensuralcly compared
to Pixnr movies—products or n completely dif»
t‘crent moment in technology. The fact thnr Fern
Gully Wasn‘t produced by n corpomlc conglomer-
zit: in the let century does not demict from its
vnlu s it film mending to an important issue. It
was also criticized for its “outdii lung," but we
don't stop wntehing 803 movie t because we
no longer say “tubula " The review proposes a
cariclntioil between nctors'famc and their value,
no if all worthy performances evenrunlly lend to
Hollywood stardom. This kind ot‘ priori
ormtlues constructs wlmt the review aptly
“til: business," But is this really how we w t
to wntch mnvies~as n comparison of products
mtlicr than an engagementwitl‘l an?
