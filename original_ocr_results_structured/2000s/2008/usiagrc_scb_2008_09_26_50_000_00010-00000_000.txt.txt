Some know hei on a first name basis while others
simply refer to her as the ”really friendly smiley” lady
at the information desk. but every Grinnell student has
shared a hello with Joe Rosenﬁeld ’25 Center receptions
ist Connie Coleman.

it is difficult to imagine spending more than a day
on campus without receiving one or Connie's patented
smiles Although Coleman's warm, calming personality
is widely known on campus, few Grinneilians have had
the opportunity to extend their conversations with her
beyond a friendly hello. Here is your chance to get to
know the spirit behind the smile.

Constance K, Coleman grew up on a farm iii tiny
Malcolm, Iowaﬁust 15 minutes east of Grinnell. As
the oldest orrour children, and the only girl, Coleman
found herself assigned the traditional farm girl chores.
"I always got stuck doing the cooking, the wash and the
dishes,” she said.

To escape the mundane rigors offarm life, Coleman
often turned to books. “I just loved to read," she said.
“Anything away from the farm was great then."

Despite the few shortcomings offarm life, Coleman
had trouble tearing herself away from home. While she
moved to Davenport after getting mariied at age 18, she
could not hear to stay away permanently. “I had to come
back every weekend because I missed [home] so much,"
she said.

Coleman has since returned to Malcolm and set up
a permanent home. She resides just a block away fiom
her mother and within several miles of two ofher farin-
dwelling hiotheis.

Love for family is an overarching theme in Coleman's
life, She has two children—Steven, twenty-two, and Pat,
twenty seveniaud two grandchildren with a third on
the way. When asked to identify her current passion
in life, she immediately mentioned her grandchildren. 1
would spend time with them everyday, but their parents
object." she said, .

Coleman’s road to Grinnell has not been without
speed humps. “l was a single Mom and 1 had worked in
a restaurant for 12 years making as an hour,"she said. “I
decided i wanted something better."

Coleman found this “sorticthing better" at Gtinnell.
She has spent over is years at the college, including
about 10 years walking in Grinnell Dining Services
bakery and three ycais at Grab and Go—the predecesr
so of out leesiiuid has enjoyed cacli of thcse jobs
“I loved working in the bakery it was really fun at Crab
and Go, and i love this job,’ she said

In her current position Coleman especially enjoys
interacting with students “I really like to see the kids
every day," she said. “It just makes me happy."

With some students, Coleman has grown particur
larly close. This summer, she received mail for an alum
searching for a permanent address, And a few summeis
ago, another student nearly boarded at her house. “I get
to know difrerent students every year," Coleman said,

For any Student‘ivl‘icthcr she knows them well
or has simply shared a smile as they pass through the
JRC—Coleman is always willing to lend a hand. “Ifl
can help,l do," she said. “Ifyoii need a hug, you got in"

Local

Although the main pur—
pose of the potluck was to
celebrate local foods, the main draw was not
the locally grown produce, but the locally
slaughtered goat. Animal rights activists can
rest assured that the goat lived out the last of
his days frolicking in the peace-
ful prairie lands ofCERA.

The goats were provided
to MAP researchers as part 0
a pasture agreement, in which
Grinnell farmer Barney Barr
henfuse “loaned" the research
ers 21 goats in exchange for grazing rights at
CERA.

According to Perbix, the MAP tested the
effectiveness of goats to remove the invasive
plants, multiﬂora rose and mirm [riparian

weeks ago, the researchcrs returned all but

goat was then slaughtered.

“[Thc goat] was shot in the head With a

to describe in detail the hutchering process.
which included using one ofBathenfuse's traCr

he and about ﬁve other Grin»
nellians took turns taking bites

Before he supplied the colv

lcge With goats, Barhenfuse

already had a history with the college. In the

early 19905, he was invited as a guest speaker

to an ngricultulc class, and he said he giiined a
lot from the experience

“I found out how little they knew about

faiming,"he said, “which told me how ll“l)0r*

rant it was that i had an opportunity to give

them an opportunity to learn about farming."

Since then, he has continued coming to
Grinnell as a guest speaker and also accepted
student interns and partnered in research, Bat»
henﬁise has also expanded his audience, visits
ing community colleges in the area and even
preschools.

Barhenfuse has been involved in local food
for around 18 years and has worked closely
with Practical Farmers of Iowa, a sustains
ahle agriculture organization. “[Thc group is]
just looking at nonetraditional ways or doing
things," he said. ”Or in some respccts getting
back to traditional ways."

With Grinnell students starting to go back
to traditional ways as well, it is lucky there
aie experienced local eaters like Barhcntiise
aiound to help them. “We’ve hecn doing it for
a long time." he said. “I really believe in local
foods."
