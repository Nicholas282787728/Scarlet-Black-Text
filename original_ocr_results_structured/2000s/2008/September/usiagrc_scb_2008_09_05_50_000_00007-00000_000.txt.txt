In the backyard cfEcohouse, an ontnge spider hung precar»
iously from a clothing line, unaware that Neal Wepking ’10 was
aiming a walnut at its fragile weh. Ecohouse resident Christine
Grumman ’11 intervened at the last moment, “Don’t i‘ck with
its home, Neal!" ,

, Wepking paused and dropped the weapon. As the house-
mates headed out of the yard, Wepking delivered a parthian
shot. "We should figure out a way to use those wnlnuts," he
said.

The ten students living in the stucco house on East Street,
Wepking, thrnmon, Hnrr Ford-Hodges '10, Eric Nest ’09,
Jacob Gjesdahl ’10, Alex Reich ’11, Hannah Sagin '11, Shyam
Deshpande '11, Nathan Pavlovic ’10 and Sam Calisch '10. are
training themselves to use local, sustainable resources as much
as possible in their everyday lives.

Ecohouse is both a home and an experiment in energy cfe
hcicncy and green living, “We knew the scope of it would be
much bigger than the normal project liousc,"Grummon said,

The residents of Eeoheuse already have a list of goals that
they hope to accomplish hanging on their wall in the living
room. They are interest~
ed in getting rnm barrels,
chickens, and they have
already committed to
helping get an electron-
ic energy consumption
monitor installed on the
Grinnell cnrnpus.

The electric monitoring system will moderate the tempera—
ture, electricity, naniral gas, and water consumption. The goal
is to have “the raw data come upstairs through cthernet cables
to a computer in the kltchen,"said Nost.

The data will then be easily accessible, and Grinnell stu—
dents will be able to discover what they most need to cut back
on. “By knowing how much you use, you will know to decrease
it," said Pavlovic,

In addition, the members of Ecohouse have each commit-
ted to do an independent study project, Pavlovic’s project fo~
cuses on “ecceviﬂages and the soeinl components ofwhat keeps
them together, and how we can apply lhal to Eeohouse,"

Ford-Hodges nnd wepking are working together on n proj-
ect mining to expand a local foodebuying coeop. They will ulso
be learning how to do ethnographic tcstntch, nnd FordrHodgcs
will be focusing on federal policy regarding innning restric-
tions. “And we’ll be doing a one hundred-mile dict starting at
the end ofthis month.”siutl Fordel‘lodges,“Scar)c"A lOOemile
tlier consists ofonly curing ind drinking produets thntnte made
within 100 miles of Grinnell. “Luckily, Hawkeye is included,"
said Wepking.

Despite the stresses of caring for Ecohouse while keeping
up with school work and extracurricular activities, the house

rnntes seem remarkably relaxed, and Ecohouse nlrendy feels like
a home. In the living room, which is covered in environmene

Consists of sunﬂowers, squash, corn, rind beans. The Ecohouse
members have already reaped the beneﬁts of this garden many
times by snneking on and canning these different vegetables.
This vegetable garden is especially helpful, considering half the
house is completely otrrhc meal plnn.

Although most of the residents of Ecol-louse were origi*
nally members of the campus organization Free the Planet, it
wns not n prerequisite, But it looks like Eeohouse is soon to
become a club all its own,“You'll know the house by the Greek
sign rnnde by Eric rtnd Neal," Grummon snid, enthusiastically
reteiencing the wooden pseudoetrnt sign on which .i sigma, a
snicwnys omegn, rind n theta tire carved.

Like nny decent frat—even a fake one—Ecohonse nhendy
has one successful party to its name. Last weekend, the houses
mites threw a “House wnrnung not Global wni-rning" putty,
where revelers were asked to bring their own cups to avoid
wisring plastic. “We hnd to clean up ulmost nothing,” Grunts
tnon said. “People reiily lespondetl and it was awesome"

Ecohousc will continue opening its doors to other Grinnell
students, with screenings of the Discovery Channel series
Planet Earth, monthly local food dinner parties and other
events to learn about sustainability. “We'll be having sustains
able living events throughout the semester that will be less
intoxicating," Pavlovie said, But as Ecohousc will soon teach
the Grinnell campus, piotecting the environment is the most
intoxicating drug ofall.
