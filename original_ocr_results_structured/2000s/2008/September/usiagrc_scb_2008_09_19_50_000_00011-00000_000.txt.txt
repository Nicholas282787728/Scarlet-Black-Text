The mysteries that lie off campus

Adam Barrett ’08 takes readers on an adventure to Arbor Lake, a treasure hidden in Grinnell, IA

Grinncll college does a row thrngs very
well. You probably know this. It is why you
are licrc.

one or those things rs kccpntg the srur
dent body busy.

Look at any one day or the week at
Grinrrcll, and you wrll ﬁnd enough activi-
ties to entertain you for threeiilssuming,
of course, that you do not have 27 hours of
homework to pack into the next 24.

Small wonder. then, that many ofus never
escape our little bubble between Highway o
and 10th Avenue.

Sittrng smack in the middle ora universe
of wonder, dclight, and tree rnovles, who
could ask for more>

An advcnturcrithrit's who.

outside the warm, asphyxi Ibg embrace
of academy, there is a world to discover, and
our own littlc corner of it is not without its
delights.

Gitd your loins, ready your
buckles for swashing, and pre-
pare yourselffor adventure.

Each week, I intend to
reveal more fantastic locus
tions and suggest fun things
for each of them. Let’s begin
with ,

Arbor Lake

Tucked away on of Highway 146, Arbor
Lake is a quiet, tree-lined body orwater cnr
crrclcd by a gravel trail.

It is a wonderful place to go for a stroll in
the autumn air or just sit and watch the ducks
swimming merrily about, quacking to one our

”Perhaps a sword fight on a
stream bank? Makesliifisabers
should be plentiful bull/(lull need
[a bringyuur own pirate llai."

olhcl (lfthat's your idea of adventurcl)

First, the dileL‘tiUlis’VVi‘lk or bike west
from the Chrystal Ccntcr until you hit
Spring Street, one block past two, lrtrnmc rs
light, you n go
up Main i ad
or sprrng
ﬂatter ridc— ut
you’ll have to
cross 146 unrudr
ed by stop lights.

erenyou hit
Washrngron Avenue, hang a
right. When you rrrn out orroad,you'rc rlrerel
(Total distance from campus: 13 blocks)

Now let's have some fun.

Before you make it to the trail itself, take
advantage of the fact rhar Washington ends
in a ridiculously long downward slope.

Get yourself giddy running or rolling to
the parking lot below
thc! (Note to bik-
ers: fun stufflikc this
is why I wear a heir
mot.)

once you hrt the
trail (which is, sadly,
not terribly brkeable>,
take a minute to catch
your breath. Enjoy the sounds and smells of
nature. Walk around a bit.

Then I suggest that you take advantage of
the fact that nature is full ofhiding places.

Bchind the row of trees on the west side
or the trail, for example, ls a long stretch of
tall grass, ﬂowers, and thorny bushes.

 

I'm sure you can think ofall kinds offun
things to do in there! Whispered meetings of
a top-secret Adventurers' Society, anyone?

Falther down the trail |S a secluded ci‘c .

tron,

Tray water
falls tinldc on,
walled in bytrecs
on both sides,

This is the kind

or place where I

like to get creative,
crossing the stream and crossrng back.

Perhaps a sword ﬁght on a stream bank?
Makeshift sabcrs should be plentiful, but
you'll need to bring your own pirate hat.

Ifyou go back to thc trail and head farther
along, you’ll ﬁnd a small prairie, It's pretty,

Ityou’rancy hiding yoursclrin tall grass so
you can jump out and yell “boo‘”, then this is
rho place {or you.

At the edgeorthc prairie,rhc path swerves
back into thc woods.

There's some pretty tun stuff in there,
but I'll leave that for you to discover on your
own.

Incidentally, rr you glanced to the right as
you started down the trail at the very begine
nrng, you might have seen the Hazelwood
CCmCtCl’yr

As you pass back on your way out, you
may want to pay a visit. Personally, I’m not
much for telling spooky stories at dusk, but
that doesn’t rule out a respectful cartwheel for
the dead.

 

SGA clarifies
self governance

AS thc liaison between the students and
the administrators, it is only logical that we
have been rrelded questions on what ls go-
ing to happen to the selfrgovernance policy
on Campus

We do not feel that the increase of ale
coholrrelated incidents on campus, the ap-
pcarance of administrators at parties and the
placement of Sheree Andrews on adminiss
trativc leave indicates the weakening of sclfr
governance.

President Osgood and Houston Dough-
erty have repeatedly said that the administrar
tiun has not made any moves to change the
sclrsgovernance policy on campus.

Why is it that we, as a student body, per»
ccivc the administration as the sol: dcfincrs
ofsch—govcrnancc, when that duty falls to the
community as a whole.

The philosophy of self-governance has
been around at Grinncll College evcn bcforc
it became a
policy in 1968.

Sclfrgovcrr
nance is meant
to stress the
importance of
holding each
other accounts
able for our actrons to ourselves, our peers,
and to the community as well as caring for
one another. It is a philosophy that is highly
dependent on the actions of the students.

Even in the Selfrgovcrnancc Handbook,
there is no mention ofthc administration.

ls self-governance alive when, already,
multiple students have been transported to
the hospital for alcohol related incidents?

As we see selregovcrnancc, it is the respons
sibility of every rndividual in the community

fellow Grin/vellum.”

"AS we see selfsgovemance, iii: the
responsibility ofevery individual in
the community to take care of our

to take care ofour fellow Grinncllians, even if
it means being the obnoxious person asking,
“Have you had enough?"

Irresponsible drinking is not a failure of
salt-governance, iris a r ’lurc ofsclfrconrrol,

As a student body it is necessary that we
align our actions with our values and behave
as the responsrble adults that we are.

We should challenge ourselves to keep
self-governance strong.

It is up to the students to uphold its prin-
ciples and to take care of one another. That
is what it means to be a Grinnellian. Rcmcmr

Self governance
misunderstood

Your oprnron last week wrth regard to
seltegovcrnancc misses a fundamental irony:
student self-governance is imposed and dc
fined by the administration ofthc college.

When an authonty requires a Commu—

nity to sclfrgovcrn and at the same
time deﬁnes this governance as the
responsibility oflndividuals to in-
teract in specified ways, there is no
true sclfrdeterminatlon,

Rather, there is an attempt by
the authority to reduce its work-
load while maintaining the ability
to specify the range of acceptable hehavrors
and relationships.

Any real self-governance must not be
mandated by an entity external to the sclfv
governing community, as is Grranell Coir
lege’s student self-governance policy,

True salt-governance would arise from
the student body collectively agreeing on
responsibilities, restrictions. and methods of
enforcing accountability. At present, these
policies are all decided by the college's ad-

ministmllonillie apparent recent shift in air
cohol policy is an cxampchy ﬁrstyear, there
was a lot otralk about sclfrgovcrnancc bcing
broken and of thc nccd [D fix it.

or course, this talk went nowhere; “self-
governance" is only broken to the extent that
the administration is unhappy with students
refusing to follow its policies, and there is no
real self-governance to for.

Students should
vote October 1

I'm voting here in Grinncll on October
1 because in 2004, Iowa went for Bush by a
margin of 10,000 votes.

This year, the race is even closer, The
ObamarMcCain race isn’t the only one that
matters, either. Representative Eric Palmer,
who helped raise Iowa's minimum wage to
$7.25/hr, faces a tough race against Danny
Carroll, Whose scat he won in 200d

State Senator Tom Reilly is running for
re-election, as is your congressional represen—
tative Leonard Boswell.

I understand the impulse to vote whcrcvcr
you're from. I'm a native Oregonian, and this
year we have the chance to oust an entrenched
Republican senator.

But I'm voting in Iowa because I know I'll
have the biggest impact here.

In 2004, Poweshiek Counry went Repub—
hcan by the smallest of margins and contrlbr
uted to George Bush’s victory, Tlrrs year, make
sure your vote really counts - vote in Iowa.

Early voting will be hold all day October
lst in the Forum, Students will be outside the
Dining Hall with voter registration forms at
lunch and dinner next week.
