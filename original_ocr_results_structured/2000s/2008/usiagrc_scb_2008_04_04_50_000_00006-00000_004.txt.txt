The character will be “a nice blend ofhnmor, intensity and sexual appeal,
with a scarred past that will come into play at a crucial point deep in the sea-

I've never seen a grown man cry like thar before."

Silence in_art
changes lIves

Bl JAMFS ANTI IoFEIt

in articulating silence and distance Guy Leattistier, a visit-
ing seholar from the Gland cultdre Ministry ofOld Europe, on
international organization that spreads the best in Old European
culture, has expanded the art world or Grinnell by a quantum
leap.

Almost simply by virtue of his auanogarde reputation,
Leartistier destroys our very conceptions of meaning and inten-
tion and replaces them with a newly fashioned paradigm of ex
isrenrial angst and brokenehearted acceptance of the vicissitudes
ofljfe,

As part of his current art installation in Grinnell,“Reclain-r
ing Desire; or a Portrait of Baldness: Coming Through, coming
out", Guy placed nonefunctioning radio receivers throughout
campus this week and enlisted randomly chosen disadvantaged
Americans from the streets of New York City, Los Angeles, and
Chicago to spread the gospel of résistancc and transcendence
through silence throughout the student body

Guy recalls that the idea had come to him all the way back in
1981,when he took a class at the Institut Pretensiuscier, a small
liberal arts college on the outskirts ofParis “I learned about the
true pioneers orsilence I mean silence is really the noisiest
sound ofall,"said Guy “I think ofour world as one srmng up on
a giant pole, rotating around an axis ofpure love. When that love
is attacked by the darlt forces of rallt radio, zoology, and extrem-
ism, we should all feel threatened."

In one of the other deﬁning moments of his life. this time
at a commune in the Pyrenees, Guy met his spiritual gaide Sky
Blue Redfellow, who introduced him to the concepts of dis
once, resistance, defiance, and radical action pioneered by the
Little-known grerrilla artist known simply as A (pronounced by a
sound similar to a mooing ofa cow).

A organized many of the Dadaisr riors during the 1960's,

Hip-hop confuses hipsters

Concerts brings another non~indie band to campus: widespread panic, angst

BY REBECCA PARK

This weekend’s Gardner concert promises to shock more
than a few hipsters. Instead of the White Rabbits or the Blue
Stars at the Purple Shirts, Concerts is bringing, for the ﬁrst
time in recent memory, a noneindie band to campus.

“I really don't know how it happened," said Concerts Chair
Josh Lindgren '08. “They just seemed to slip in the schedule,"

Not only does 13sz not hail from Brooklyn or Portland,
but they also don't play acoustic guitar, and none otthe band's
members wear skinny jeans. Their musie, which could best be
described as a mix between house and hipehop, doesn’t even
compare to the follrdhonorary indieugroups that concerts
sometimes sponsors.

The general response has been one of surprise and confue
sion. “Yeah, I’ve had some people contact with concerns and
questions," Lindgren admitted, "Like, ‘What do I wear?,”How
should I danceP,’ ‘What kind of substances should I be taking
beforehand>"' But, Lindgren assured, PBR and pot are still ac-
ceptablc,

Even with all these pieces or advice, Lindgren is worried,
“I just have visions of all these dazed hipsters swaying and
stunned, clustered in corners in Gardner,"he said.

So what can one expect ar such an unexpected show? Turne
tables, pants that aren't skin-tight, and dancing that involves
more than just jumping up and down. And sad, lost-looking
hipsters.

which often involved toilet seats, giant poles, and the creation
otnew alphabets and language-wide really created a way for an
artist to make unscnse of his or her metaphysical exastcntialist
crises," said Redfellow over the phone. “I can't believe he's not
better known, but I love the way Guy is carrying on his legacy."

Tonight, Guy will complete the installation, which he starred
on Tuesday afternoon at rwilight, by drawing a giant spherical
ring around Mae field with chalk he had bought while in Tibet
over the summer at a peace conference. "Peace, and distance, and
openings, and closings and other ideas were ettrcmely impor»
tant to me in this part ofrhe installation," said Guy. “I thought of
A,I thought ofThoreau,I thought ofAllcn Ginsberg and John
Zorn. Mostly, I just thought a lot."
