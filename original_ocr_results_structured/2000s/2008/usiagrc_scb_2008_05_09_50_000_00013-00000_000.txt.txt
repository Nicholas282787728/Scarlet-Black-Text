Substances galore: improve your athlethic performance!

in their final appearance, our heroes proclaim how much and which substances to take before stepping up to bat

BYJOHNNY Busra

Forget the conrbo of booze and baseball.
Maior League Baseball needs another sort of
pregame substance added to the mix: ste—
roids.

Don't get me wrong rm all for prcegame
drinking. \thther the moderate,Gin &Tonic
before a sweaty game ofcroquer back in the old
country, or the excessive, kegs and AOrycarrolds
at a summertime slow-pitch softball game, im-
bibing is a great way to make otherwise point-
less sports enjoyable, and even exhilarating.
But when there are faithful fans such as my-
selfwatching a sport, I want to see sometlrrng
more than the sauce. I want the juice.

Steroids, while illegal. saved baseball, After
the 1994 strrke, baseball was slowly slipping
out of America's conciorrsness. Players came
off as greedy, games as boring, and the whole
sport as distant. Then, transported out of the
cost pool ofcalifornia and dropped under the
great blue Midwestern sky, Mark McGwire
landed as a savior in St. Louis.

McGwire was huge and he could hit, far.
He was a serious B.A.M.F., and captivated
America as he chased down the comparatively
weak Roger Maris. He brought baseball roars
ing back to life with his 70 home runsr and
ticket sales and frindom have been riding high

server to hate.

In those gloriorr days of 1998, we trusted
McGwire and his intense work ethic as the
leading producers or his widogirth biceps.
When his steroid use became evident, part of
America pulled the plug on their hero. Detrac-
tots and pretentious “purists" kicked Merire

Burwhy? Why
do we shun baseball users and their steroids? Is
there anything more exciting than a 500 foot
home run? By bannrng steroids, we prevent
already Ruthian players from becoming some
thing greater and even more badass, With the
issue of steroids, we should turn to baseball's
most pure fans-children. And I promise you,
next time you’re watching a baseball game, find
your 5 year old cousirr/sister/babysitee and ask
them what they want to see happen next. I
promise you they'll say a home run.

It was brisk autumn nrght, and the B05-

proverbial hell from which no team had evel
emerged the \ucmrtTl 's, however, was no ore

be stopped. a bottle ofjack Daniels. 25 shots

defeated the sober and uptight Yankees. jack
and the Red Sox did not look back, as they
reeled off 8 wins in
a row on their way
to vanquishing the
so-yeat-old curse
that plagued them.

It doesn‘t mat-
ter if it’s a beautiful
Sunday afternoon
baseball game or a Saturday night at Harris,
Americans love drrnlcing, In fact, per capita
we consume 2.24 gallons of grain alcohol a
year, a staggering number considering all
those among us who don’t indulge in the nec-
tar ofthe gods.

Studies have shown that alcohol increases
blood ﬂow to the brain and in moderation
is even good for your heart. Given its physi—
cal beneﬁts, it's surprising that alcohol con-
sumption isn't more prevalent in the sports
ing world. For too many a timc,1 have seen

consrder a first-year, right before the frrst
game of the season, never having played colt
lcge competition. Nor only would the nerves
be full octane, but also the lack of confidence
would be apparent to anyone watching.

Now, let’s consider the same ﬁrsl'yeﬂl af-
ter a shot ofJack What one would see is a
mote relaxed and conﬁdent individual, ready
to conqllei and defeat the opponent at a mo
ment's notice. All of this, without the harm
ful side effect of being drunk, while still have
ing the attrrbutes necessary to succeed in the
sporting world,

1 am confrderrt that there are many arhe
letes who have consumed alcohol right before
a game and righteously so, as there are no
NCAA rules against it.

There is no one who can argue consum-
ing alcohol before a game does not have a
plethora ofbenefrts, rncluding alleviating the
hangover from the nrght before.

So even though your coaches might not
approve, next time your lacing up your shoes
before the big gamc, reach into your gym
bag, kick back a couple shots and win one for
home team.
