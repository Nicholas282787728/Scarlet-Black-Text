Extending awareness beyond this week

Dealing with hate

The hate crime perpetrated in Haincs
Hall last Friday came as a shock to most
everyone at Grinneli. our communit'r
known for its socially progressive policies
and liberal student body/7‘ ced an HIV
pleasant truth. Namely, that intolerance
and hatred still exist on our campus.

A week later and the same questions
seem to be circulating around campus.
Who did it? Why did they do it? How
many people harbor homophob' are

the problem of intoleranceinot just hoe

Reaching out

Like marry others, I was deeply saddened
and distressed by the hate crime that was
coinmittcd on earrrpns this weekend I spent
the weekend at the Midwest GLBTA (Gay,
Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgcrrder, Ally) College
Conference, patting us on our collective back
as I listened to students from other schools
talk about problems with intolerance and ha-
tred on their campuses, only to be reminded
upon my return to Grinnell that our commu-
nity is not free from these issues.

However, while it is easy to take my feels
ings of contusion, sadness, hurt and frustra-
tion and bottle them up into anger at the one
or several students who committed this hate
crime, I recognize that cursing out these stu-
dents will not undo this action, nor prevent it
from occurring again. We need to question
what lack of communication and understand
ing has led these students to take such hateful,
thoughtless actions.

We need to question ourselves: have we
been guilty otspcnding too much time parting
ourselves on the back tor our acceptance and
embracemeiir of diversity without providing
an outlet for discussion for those in our com-
munity to whom acceptance does not come as
naturally?

I hope we can take this terrible, hurtful ac»
tion as a lesson. To those otyou who chose to
commit this hate ciime: I am sorry that you
have not found a better way to express your-
selves in Grinncll. To those of you who, like
me, want to be able to give us a morc well-
deserved pat on the back, please be Willing to
engage yourselves in mature, patient dialogue
and help us to cultivate love and understand—
ing by demonstrating it towards those whose
views are different from our own.

been organized to show
that no one at Grinnell
should feel threatened

But these tormrrl events bring to light
larger questions that individuals must cone
tinue to ask themselves, even as the activist
fervor otthis week petcrs off. What prompt»

consider themselves homophobic, may only
feel a further division between themselves
and the loud mothhc noise pollution made
by banging pots and pans will be disruptive
and could verge on violent. it will be a brazen

What worries inc is that this fervor to rnoV
bilizc has more to do with emotional excites
ment and outrage than a srrrcere platform for
reconciliation and change. It is rare that such
enthusiasm lasts for morc than a few weeks.
Like most activism events on this campus,tlns
one will probably go down as reactionary and
brash (like the “Hate-Free Gtinnizll March"
in 2005, or the “Darfut D' -In" in 2007).

SGA is preparing legislation to form an
Ad Hoc Committee to confront issues such
as “bii motivated acts,” which could be a
good thing — but I have my reservations (and
not the space to speak ofthcm hcic). For now,
why is it that we only react to problems on
campus when sensational events occur? And,
will this initiative to build bridges really last.>

Yes, any act of hateful violence should be
condemned. But no, violence should not her

We would like to respond to the state
ment in last week’s S85 editorial that cut
mulative graderpoint average (GPA) was
the “principal factor" used to determine ade
mission to Grinnelltianondon (GIL) for
next fall, GPA was determinative in only a
small number ofapplications, and although
these students were not admitted to GIL in
this extraordinarily competitive year, most
were judged to be suitable candidates for
other offeeampus study programs and gin
en the option of applying to one of their
choice. In the vast majority of cases, where
GPA was not an obvious issue, the admisr
sions committee selected students on the
basis of a broad range of criteria. includ
ing written academic rationale, suitability
or program courses in the roureyear plan.
recommendations, and GPA.

All students who were not accepted
were offered other offrcampus study op
tions, which included Obcrlin-in-London,
a program very similar to GIL, operating at
the same site and under the same director.

The “unexpected" rush of applicants
to Grinuell-in-London—thc ﬁrst time in
twenty years that there have been more -
plicants than places—managed to surpr
everyone, and we agree that there is a need
to plan for the possibility ofsiich an occur—
rence in the future,

Next year, we intend to revise the ap-
plication torm so that all applicants select
tirst- and second-choice programs, thus
bringing GIL in line with standard ocs
procedures. We regret that we were unable
to accommodate more students in GIL this
year.

In closing, we would like to note that we
shaied essentially all ofrh‘is information in
an eatenslve interview with the 565’}? more
