Crrinnell College in the tumultuous period of

the 19605 nnt‘l'705,

The liltc 196 to the early 19705 was n
time orglobal actiiisin, ch gc,nlld discontent
(see article, page 2), and Go lell College was
no exception. “In many ways '68 was a world-
wide phenomenon," said Bob Grey, Political
Science. “There was a sense that electoral poll»
tics would no longer solve problems."

Throughout the lure ’605, American ﬂCllV’
ism ﬂourished, with events such as the Chit
cano walkouts in Los Angelcs that protested
immigrant bushing throughout the city and
public schools and the famous protest at the
Democratic National convention in Chicago,

According to Victoria Brown, History. said
that the assassinations of several prominent
political leaders in the ‘60s, such as President
John F. Kennedy, Malcolm X, Martin Luther
King ir, Mrdgir livers and Bobby Kennedy,
created a sense of rebellion and revolution in
the collegeraged youth orthe late 19605.

“Young people were in many ways left on
their own," Brown said, referring to the death
of the political leaders. “Sixtyreighr undercut
the credibility of the government so much so
that it gave antirwat protesters more credibil-
ity, and so the polls shifted towards the anti-
war etiort."

John Andelson ’71. Anthropology, said that
student activism at Grinnell was impossible to
ignore. “I remember wilting up one morning
to see 500 white crosses throughout south
Campus with the names or people in ROTC
at the College, as well as college graduates who
were in the Vietnam VVnr,"Andelson said. “It
was supposed to represent the threat or death
on a large scale."

The protest was initially intended to prov
test a Marine recruiter's visit to campus, but
quickly turned into a broader demonstration
against the war in general. “[The protest] got
all wrapped up in the question ‘15 the war
worth dying tori“ Andelson said.

Thirty years later, the United States is
again fighting a controversial and protracted
foreign war, but the spirit of activism. while
still present, has changed. “Your generation
sees problems in a much more global wiy You
don’t seem to be native about the issues,”Browu
said.“ I can‘t imagine my students sitting in my
ofﬁce, talking about revolution."
