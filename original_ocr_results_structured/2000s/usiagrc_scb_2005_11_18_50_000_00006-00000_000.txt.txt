International students struggle to obtain visas to study and work in U.S.

BV MARISA WHITLEY

Most students don’t need to 3}),
ply to apply to Grinnell. That's just
Jingkan Cu '05 had to do to obtain a
hardrsought student visa. Gil, a student
from China, had to apply for his visa
{our times before being approved. on
his tourth try, he convinced rhe enr
bassy ofﬁcer that after graduating from
Grinnell he would seek his PhD. at
London‘s School of Economics.

”It's excruciating when you got into
a good college," he said. “Later on,1figr
ilred out what [the ofﬁcers at the em~
bassy] want.”

In countries not on the best terms
with the Unilcd Statcs, students must
go through a particularly difﬁcult Pm,
cess to gain permission to come here.

“It has just been historically dif-
ﬁcult for some students to get visas to
the United States. Chinese students are
an example,” Director of International
Student Services Janet Alexander said
via email. “During the last 7 years,
between 20—50 percent of Chinese
students applying for visas to study at
Grinnell were denied annually. "

This trend has attended to stur
dents across the globe as the number
of international students studying in
the United States has decreased mark-
edly over the last few years. “Aftcr 9/11,
many students from many colleges
and universities experienced difﬁculty
or delays getting visas," she said. Ac-
cording to Alexander, Grinnell has not
experienced a decline in rhe number of
international students emailed.

Students who want to study in the
United States can apply for either a Jr
1 or Frl visa. All
visa is a program
sponsored visa in
which students
study in their home
country for two
years before ﬁnish-
ing their B.A. at an
American college or
university. Students
on Jrl visas must
return to their home country immedir
arely after graduating to fulfill u river
year work requirement.

Kholoud Hassan ’06, a student
from Egypt is at Grinnell on a Jrl visa.
“1 will probably [return to the United
States], but I'm gorng to go home
and see how the job opportunities are
there," she said. “1 think ifl apply later
for a master's irwill be good to have job
experience."

tional Practical Training (0.? The
student mustwork at ajob in her major
and at a level “commensurate with their
education level," said Alexander. “They
may be an economics major, but that
doesn't mean they can sell french fries
at McDonald’s."

Students here under the F-1 visa
can apply for O.P.T. through the Unite
ed States Citizens
ship and Immigrar
tion Service. The
authorization of
the visa can take up
to 90 days. Having
to apply for 01> .
three months prior
to graduation can
be an inconvenience
for some students,
although it’s not
required for rhem to have a job when
applying for the program. “There lire
a lot of hoops students have to jump
thlough,” said Alexander. “I'm not sure
i would know all the things they have
to know early on."

If students want to stay in the
United stares past their O.P.T. period,
rhey must get their employer to sporr
sot them for an HrlB visa, a thrcerycar
working visa that can be extended for
another three years.

Obtaining an Hell? has recently

become more dinicult since the pool
went from 195,000 to 65,000 visas in
2004. Grinnell alum j.P. Ramos ’05
learned this the hard way. He was unr
able to obtain a job before graduating
and didn’t find one until October.

The capacity of H-1B visas had
been reached in August, so he will to
turn to rhe Philippines when his O.P.T.
runs out in July. He will then have to
wait there for about three months until
his 1-1-11: visa comes through.

“I found ltvctyfrusttating some
times you’re not so lucky to graduate
with a joh,"he said. “To add to the dif-
ﬂculty, I was having to tell my poten-
tial employers that I would need to be
sponsored for an HrlB and take a few
weeks off work."

The Student and Exchange Visi—
tor lnformdtion System (SEVIS) also
serves as a bump in the road for internae
tional students wishing to stay SEVIS,
implemented after 9/11, requires col—
logos and universities to track all lnrctr
national iiliinini under OFT. Students
are required to report their dependents,
residency and employer.

Gu was uncomfortable with the
system at ﬁrst, but “I understand from
a U.s. people's perspective," he said. “It's
part or the experience of living abroad
by yourself. .. even the visa application,
it toilgliens you up."
