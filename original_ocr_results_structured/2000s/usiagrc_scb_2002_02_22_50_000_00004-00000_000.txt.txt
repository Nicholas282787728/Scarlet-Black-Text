Working in SSA, I' ve seen the
advancement of several ideas which
would benefit the student body.
These ideas include the tuition
guarantee, the increase of student
interaction with the board of trustees,
the need for student space, and the
desire to create discourse on budget-
ary matters, Iwill continue to work
towards these goals: Additionally, my
administration will develop new goals
such as 1). Clarifying the colleges
alcohol policy 2). Making a concerted
effort for more diversity on senate
and cabinet, 3.) Presenting the
implementation of a campus audit to
the Board of Trustees

I am running for SGA President because
I am a highly qualiﬁed and concerned
student. As an individual I am
qualified and as a woman who has been
involved with SGA, I am concerned. My
leadership experience and involvement
in many campus groups speaks to my
commitment to Grinnell. And the
under-representation of women in SGA
greatly concerns and motivates me.
Take this into consideration when you
are deciding who will be your next
representative.

lam a Poi ical Science major/Latin
American Studies concentrator, born
in Argentina and raised in Iowa. As
SGA President, I know I can maintain
the student-administration contact
and facilitate the actions necessary
for students to engage sucessfully in
selrgovemance My experiences as a
former Senator and as current
Administrative Coordinator have
inﬂuenced my Presidential bid in two
major ways. Firstly, I have realized the
imminent need for broad diversity in
order to attain fair represenation and
create a sense of alliance with the
campus community. Secondly, SGA
must be efﬁcient. This can be
achieved by electing experinced
leaders who will appoint an experic
enced Cabinet and ensure that
students' needs are met fully and
promptly.

Kenneth Yeung

My fellow Grinnellians,
My name is Kenneth Yeung and I
would be honored to serve you as SGA
Vice President and President of
Academic Affairs. I’m currently a
junior History major. In the past, I’ve
‘ actively participated in the SGA,
including SGA Senate, Curriculum
Committee, Student Council on
Curriculum, History SEPC, Executive
Committee, and many others.
As your Vice President, I will maintain
an open channel with the administra-
tion. More importantly, I will
faithfully serve as your conduit to
reflect our voices to the administra-
tion and seek to strengthen and
expand the academic curriculum at
Grinnellr

I would like the Student Government
Association to be more accessible to
the student body. I feel that many
individuals are uncertain about how to
conduct a Mentor Advanced Project or
become a member of a Student
Educational Policy Committee. Thus, I
would encourage the administration
to make these speciﬁc services more
known to the college community as
VP/PAA. The exact policy issues thatI
support include: the remodeling of the
current MAPs system, pursue bringing
diversity to the members of Cabinet
and Joint Board, and encouraging
SEPC representatives to participate on
the Student Council on Curriculum.

The student body needs experienced
personnel at the helm of SGA in order
to achieve the standard of
representation with the
administration set by past and current
SGA leaders. To maintain the accuracy
of this representation, the leaders of
SGA must tap the wide variety or
student groups and interests. I have
the experience necessary to carry on
the work with the administration. I
also possess the appreciation and
dedication to diversity concerning
SGA affairs. This commitment, through
work on van'ous curriculum
committees, will also ensure that the
quality of Grinnell's education meets
the high expectations of the student
body.

Hi! My name is Tony Pham '03 and
I'm asking to be your next SGA
president. From leading as spokesperr
son of Asian Students in Alliance
(ASIA) to making budget decisions on
Finance Committee, I have the
executive expen'ence necessary for the
job. What sets me apart from the
other candidates is my enthusiasm,
reputation for bringing together
diverse groups on campus and ideas
for building a better Grinnell. Instead

, of SGA merely expressing opinions, we

need to have actions that directly
beneﬁt students. Some of my
proposals include lowering airport
shuttle costs, facilitating exchanges
with other colleges and creating
weekend excursions to chicago and
Minneapolis. Please don’t hesitate to
get in touch with me [pham] with
your questions and concerns. lets
build a better Grinnell together:
