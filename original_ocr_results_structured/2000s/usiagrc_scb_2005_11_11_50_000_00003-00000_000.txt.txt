Students who are considering an independent ma
jor inJapanesc Stiidics,or luc dccitling whether or not
to begin studying the Japanese language anytime soon
face uncertainty in the next few years. From course of—
ferings to professors, it seems that nothing is for sure
with this non-department,

The Japanese program exists under the umbrella
of the Chinese Department, a permanent and fully
staffed department The Japanese program is language
sequence that has never evolved into a ﬁlllrﬂedged
major program of its own.

Following the departure of the
popular Japanese professor Kenji
Takahashi, Chinese last year, Miho
Matsugu, Chinese was hired for a
tenure track position. The future
of the other two professors remains
uncertain, according to Jim Swartz,
vice president for Academic Affairs
at dean of the college.

Jin Feng, Chinese, said that
Marnie Jotenby, Chinese, has been with Grinnell
since 2004 on a grant from the Freeman Foundation
that is set to expire in 2006.The Freeman Foundation
is a philanthropic organization founded in memory of
Mansﬁeld Freeman, cerfoundcr of the international
insurance, is a financial conglomerate American 1n-
ternational Group, Inc. Among other things, the Free
man Foundation funds Asian studies departments at
numerous colleges across the us.

As there are additional funds available, the college
has requested and been given permission to continue
to use these until 2008. Whether or not Jorenby will
continue in that position remains to be decided by the
Executive Committee.

a faculty exchange program. Feng said that Kltagawfl
will most likely not he returning next year, “We typir
cally have a new instructor each year from Waseda as
according to mutual agieement,” Feng said.

As for the future hiring of permanent professors
or the establishment ofa permanent Japanese departs
rncnt, no solid plan has emeged, “The faculty Execlr
tive Council and the president have considered this
issue on a regular basis,"said Schwartz.“No decisions
have yct been made but considerations ofthe available
resources and other needs will certainly be a part of
the deliberation."

Nathalie Lnuze loo is the only
Japanese Studies Major. She said
theindependentmajoratGrinncll
has always been somewhat of a
“dicey proposition."

In a typical year, beginning,
intermediate and acbmnced Japa-
nese will be offeredThcre are no
permanent nonrlanguage classes
that students can use to build an
independent major. This, coupled with the common
practice of choosing classes based on the reputation of
the professor, discourages many students from comr
mirting to long-term study within the Japanese curr
riculum.

“It's almost insulting that it's coupled with the
Chinese department," Lauze said. ““The college rants
about their peer institutions, and quite honestly a lot
of other colleges in the United States have Japanese
departments and have had them for so years. one
hour down the road we have the University of Iowa
which has one of the best Japanese programs and we
use the books they wrote."

As a result, according to Feng, there is only one
student who is close to declaring an independent ma
jor in Japanese Studies.

its US. New: ranking, something that Grinnell itself has organized

a group to do.

““The college is more concerned about doing things to improve
the quality of Grinnell and the experience of the education here
for current students than we are concerned about the ranking," said

Mickey Munley '87, Vicerprcsidcnt for College
and Alumni Relations.

Munley admitted that the school is aware of
the importance of the us. News milking. ““A lot
of other people do care about it," he said. “We
can't ignore it." As such, a small adrhoc commit-
tee meets periodically to discuss the us, Nev/l
ranking. Munley said that the group analyzes the
rankings, and watches for anything that might
unfairly lower Grinnell’s ranking. Dean of Ad—
missions and Financial Aid Jim Sumner denied
that Grinnell is dishonest in how it presents data.

"One of the things [the committee has] done is being really
super—careful about adhering to [us Ncwr'] definitions," Sumner
said. For example, Grinnell College considers anyone who attended
the college, no mattci how long he or she was here, to he an alum.

sumner said that while many schools fudge their data to improve
their ranking. Grinnell tries not to. Grinnell's closest peer schools,

nely consider partially completed applications to be

“actionable,” and reject those applicants to lower their acceptance

does not do this.

Many students utilized the rankings
to one degree or another during their
college search.

“The ranking system was kind of a
starting base,"said Kate Morley’OS, who
was not interested in Grinnell before she
saw the college's ranking in us, Newl.

Margaret Smith ’09 said that college
rankings influenced her “initially" in her
college search. "My decision to come
here, though," she said, “was based on
visits and such.”

Sumner said that the US. NC?“ is one of the least valuable iesources

As a result, a student may get into a highnanle

not a good fit.

“as. Nle completely ignores the notion
that school number five might be better for a
given student than school number one," said
Sumner, who also said that he saw no difference
in quality between a school ranked number is
and a school ranked number five,

Sumner also doubted the accuracy of the
