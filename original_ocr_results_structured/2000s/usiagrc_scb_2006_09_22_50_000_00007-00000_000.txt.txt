Advice

Don't trust anybody here. Everybody here is a liar. If
they’re not a liar, they’re a thief. You don‘t want to hang
out with a liar or a thief. You know what they do, light?
They take things that don't belong to them. You may think
they won’t do it to you. You're the exception, right? People
have always made exeeptions for you beeause they ean sense
Quality And you're Qlalil’y people. 1 ean tell. You don't
have to tell me. You're Quality. It’s in your bearing. That
says it all

Bur you cant trust a thief. They prey on people like you
People like you dont know what the real woiId s aII about
Dont get me wlong. You probably know more about most
things than I do. I can’t hope to know about impmtant
things, things that matter. I've been living here too long and
its sucked it out of me. Sometimes I wonder if I've been
living here too long

But people like you know a lot about the world and,
still, people like you are essentially innocent. I can tell. You
went to private sehool, right? You've never had to suitor too
deeply. Don't kid a kiddcr.

I'm not trying to put you down, Take it as a compli—
ment: I’ve seen suffering. You’ve never suffered. You look
forward to things.I bet when you were a kid you even had
ambitions. People like you always have ambition, People
like you take it for granted that everyone has ambitions.
Having ambitions is a normal thing to you, like eleetrieiry
and running water.

You know, a thief, he has no ambition. His only ambi-
tion is to thieve. It’s what he was brought onto the earth to
do. He doesn’t have a mother or father like you or me. Hc
doesnr have people who love him A tliiet is an orphan at
heart. Thats why he sees a person like you a person with
ambitions, and he feels he has a right. Where do you get off,
all high and mighty?Thats what hes thinking Thats the
thinking ofa thief. I'm just calling it as I see it: tlrars what's
in a thief's hcad.

You’rejust minding your business, getting on with your
life, you say. But a thief is a low down dirty creature. He
looks up at the world from a pit and he sees someone like
you and all he ean think is where does he get oil? That’s
what he's thinking. A thief, he sees you; he is a peasant look
ing at a prince.That’s right: to him,you're a royal prince in
a purple robe on a white horse. You're six foot two and with
a eleft ehin and every ineh ofyou looks straight ahead into
the distance.You don’t have time for the petty stuff. You are
living in the horizon He looks at you in awe and he hates
you. He hates you because he really loves you. He hates you
as much as he loves you. He cannot help it and he hates
himselffor feeling what everyone feels toward a prinee. He
wishes he could killyou but let me tell you this: he will not
kill you. A thief is a eoward. All he ean do is take a pieee of
you when you're not around and make you feel like he feels
every day ofhis blessed life: like there's something missing
big inside and you don’t know how you lost it.

“Desperate, With High standards,"
reads the top of the Plans page of a
cappella group Vox. At the beginning
of this year, this taglinc exemplified
the situation of the allrfemnle group,
whose membership was signifieanrly
diminished after nine founding men‘r
bers graduated last spring

“We only had five [members] left
this year,"said Sarah Berghardt'07,Afr
tei three rounds of auditions, though,
Berghardt has confidence that Vox will
be as strong as ever. “I think [the group]
will be wonderful, because the girls we
admitted were incredibly talented," she
said.

The new Vox will benefit from the
diversity in elass years ofthe members.
"We had no diversity whatsoever in
[previous] years, which led to this crir
sis this year," said Jessica Rhoades '07l
“We have the tools to make a fantastic
group," she said, “but we shouldn't ex-

not only Vex, all male group G -Tone5
and mood group Con Brio, but a newly
formed voeal lazz group as well IVIcmA
bcrs of the groups are confident about
the year and not concerned about comr
petition for members.

The new uoeal jazz group, founded
by Elizabeth Greenbcrg '07 and Alisha
Saville '09, includes both women and
men.

“Since my freshman year IaererI’ve
wanted to start this group,"said Green»
berg. “There is really no venue on cam»
pus for vocaljazz at all, and there aren't
enough a eappella groups for everyone
who wants to be in one."

Saville said that there is enough
student interest to round out the new
group. “I have quite a few friends in the
other a cappella groups, and they've all
expressed interest, or at least support,

for starting this vocal jazz a cappella
group,"said savilie.

Adam Lorton '07 of Con Brio said
that a cappella groups are not overly
concerned about competition for mcmr
hers. “A lot of the crowd that turns out
for Con Brio is also associated with
Grinnell Singers, and so as far as I’ve
seen, in the kids that auditioned for usr
we didn’t seem to have any erossorers,"
he said.

Membership in con Eric and the
GrToncs has been relatively stable this ,
year. While both groups admit that
important members graduated last
spring, neither group feels they have
lost any ground. “We dont like hav-
ing to replace them, because they were
really great singers and fun people,”
said Lorton, “but it’s going to be niee
to have some new faces in the group."
And despite losing one ofits founding
members, Derrick Mitchell ’05, the G—
Tones auditioned 20 singers {or three
spots in the group this fall.
