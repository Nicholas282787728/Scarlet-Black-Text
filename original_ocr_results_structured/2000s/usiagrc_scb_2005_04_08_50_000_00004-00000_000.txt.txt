Fulbright

Created with the
intention of fostering
”mutual understand
ing" between the lls,
and other countries,
the government-tunded
Fulbright Foundation
sends 800 college
graduates abroad every
year. The foundation
provides travel and liv»
ing stipends for each
scholar. Applicants for
the award choose from
a list of participat-
ing countries and then
craft a research prOr
posal explaining what
they want to do with
their year abroad.

Watson

The 50 yearly rer
cipients of the Watson
Fellowship spend 12
fully-funded months
conducting research
projects abroad. The
scholars cannot return
to their home country
during the year and are
encouraged to choose
a place of study where
they have never set
foot before.

The research that
Watson Scholars con-
duct is important, but
Doug Cutchins, advisor
for the application pro-
cess, says the award is
really more about how -
the year Spent inde
pendently researching
in a foreign country
will "impact you as a
person."

Truman

A Trurnan fellowship
is a 130,000 graduate
school scholarship to
each of 75 "collegejur
niors with exceptional
leadership potential
who are committed to
careers... in the public
sen/ice." In addition to
the scholarship money,
Truman scholars also
receive "leadership
training" and graduate
school counseling.

Upon completion of
their Truman-funded
degree programs,
Truman scholars are
required to work in the
public service industry
for 3-7 years. This can
rnean working tor the
government, a horn
proﬁt or public interest
group, or a public or
private school.

MIRK

This year, Grinnellians won ﬁve
Fulbrights, two Walsons, and a Trur
man scholarship

The class onOOS’s number ofFul-
bright winners exceeded in one year
Grinncllian's roral number of Fulr
brights in the 1990s,and Eli Zigas ‘06'5
Truman Fellowship is Grinnell’s first in
15 years.

Since there are so Watson recipi-
ents and so nominating institutions, it
is unusual for a school to graduate more
than one recipient a year. Grinnellians
Watson winnels are Omondi Kasidhi
‘05 and Kyle Marquardr ‘05.

Kasidhi will study the sociocc0r
nomic impact of African runners in
Botswana, Suth Africa, Ethiopia, Mo-
rocco and Nigeria.

Meanwhile, Marquardt will study

identity and language in Azerbaijan,
Kazakhsran and Turkmenisran. Marr
quardt also won a Fulbright, but turned
it down for the Watson.

Before Doug Cutchins, Director
of Student Commitment, was hired in
2000, rhcrc was no one charged specifir
cally with advising scholarship applir
cants. But in the five years since then,
more students have learned about these
awards and applied. "The most impor
rant factor has been increasing students’
knowledge about the scholarships out
there," Cutchins said.

Cutchins stressed the importance of
recognizing all the nominees, nor jusr
rhc winners, In rhc compcurivo world
ofscholarships, “95 percent ofthe time
you don’t win,” he said.The application
process itself gives young people “the
opportunity to drcarn and plan what
you would do ifsomeonc gave you the
money to go abroad for a year."

 

Ell Zlgas
Tru m an

Before receiving the Truman Felr
lowship, Eli ngas “oo had doubts
about whether he would attend grad-
uate school but the award has provid-
ed rhc “srrong incentive" he needed
to clear his doubts. Still, Zigas is glad
that the scholarship can he used up
to four years after he graduates from
Grinncu, giving him some time be-
tween schooling.

Doug Cutchins, Zigas’ application
advisor, said that one of the environ-
mentally active Zigas’ lifetime goals is
creating "a local environmental initiar
live that can be seen nationwide as a
model." Hearing the announcement
of his “enormous" monetary award
while currently abroad in Costa Rica

has been an interesring experience for
Zigas, causing him to reﬂect on the
economic and social differences bcr
tween Costa Rica and the U.S.

The award did not come easily, as
Zigas began the intensive application
process lasr spring along wirh four
other students.“Ar limes Ijusrwanred
to scream in frustmtion while I was
trying to answer questions about my
lire plan seven years down the road
when I hadn't even studied for a rest
the next day," Zigas wmre.

In the end, Zigas said, the ﬁns
lration and planning was exceedingly
worthwhile. "The Truman proccss
taught me a lot about myself and was
valuable in and ofltseLf. In some ways
the scholarship is icing on the cake of
what I gained from the process...re-
ally thick, really delicious icing."

 

 

 

 

Joe Hansen
Fulbright

“It’s always good to go to anothr
er country as an American and pres-
ent yourself as someone who doesn'r
necessarily hold ro rhc views of our
current administration," wrote Joc
Hansen '05 via email about the year
he will spend teaching English in
Chile.

Hansen decided several years ago
that he wanted to spend his first vear

our orcollcgc teachlng English abroad.
The Fulbright “ottercd an ideal way to
do this” because he will be able lake
university classes while teaching,

The Fulbriglil Foundalion offers
Teaching Assistantships in several
countries, but Hansen wrote that he
was won over by Chile because it is
Spanisllrspcaking and has mountains.
His plans for after his ycar abroad
“change every week." l—lc'll probably

“end up as a professol "Hansen wrote.

 

 

 

Anne Salomon
Fulbright

Having traveled extensively with
her family when younger, Salomon
‘05 has visited Asia three rimcs but
never been to South KoreaThar’s one
ofthe reasons why she chose to teach
high school English there next year.

“I knew it would give me rhc ex-
perience of.., learning a new culture,”
she said, as well as “learning a new
language, but most importantly it
would challenge me." Although flu-
ent in two languages, Salomon docs

DAVID KENNEDY
not speak any Korean and said shc is
masochistically look- g forward lo the
“commonplace activities that I regard
as simple and effortless in the us. or
a Spanishrspcaking country... becom-
ing daily challenges" as she struggles
to communicate effectively

As an economics major and and
violin player, Salomon is also inter-
csrcd in Korea for scholarly reasons,
planning to study music and investi»
gate “first hand how .1 capitalisr sySr
tern has lead to a prosperous economy
in south Korea, especiallyin compari-
son ro its neighboring countries."

 

 

Lara Janson
Fulbright

Lara Janson ‘05 first learned abour
“interculniralism” during a semester
abroad in Ecuador. Interculturalism
is similar to American multicultural
attitudes about race and religion, but
“more active and uncompromising,"
Janson wrote. Interculnlrallsm places
“robust, open dialogue between ab
solute equals" as a foundation ofde—
mocracy,

Although she has not always
known that the study of inlerculmrr
alism is her calling, she recently won
a Fulbright scholarship to enroll in a
oncrycar graduate program in Latin
American Cultural Studies at La Unir
versidad Andidna Simon Bolivar in
(Line, Ecuador. Intercultumlism orig—
inarcd in Ecuador, and Janson will be
completing a rhcsis based on a com-
munity where Ecuador’s ﬁrst indigr
enous mayor uses lnterculrumhsm as
the foundation for his administration.

 

 

 

Zeke Hausfather

Fulbright
During his rirnc abroad in India,
Zeke I’Iilusfilllim ‘05 read about the
Netherlands’ cnvuoninental taxes,
Now he will be doing some research
ofhis own on the Topic while living in
rhc Nothcrlands ncxr year,
Envuomnontal rims are “a polw
ciful tool in changing behavior,.. to
make decisions that icﬂecl the c of
production and consumption on soci-
cty" bur are “somewhat taboo in rhc
U 5,,” Hausfather WHICS. “largely be-
cause of the word ‘tax’ in their name,"
Such raves ale common in Euiope,
however. Hausfather believes that
The Netherlands is a: the forefront
of markerrbased environmental poli-
cies, having implemented such taxes
“on landfilling, heavy metal wasre,
and energy use," he said. “Revenue
from the tax was used-r0 reduce taxes
on income and payroll, hclping boost
employment."

DAVID KENNEDY
After the end of his year of re

search, Hausfather hopes to publish
his findings in a journal and use it as a
stepping stone for later work. Eventu»
ally, Hausfather is considering studyr
ing sustainable development for the
World Bank or the UN.
