Naked Bake Night | Eco House | Sunday, November 15

llike to tell people that 1 look better
naked. There's something about the
curves and indents otmy body that work
better when seen in the ﬂesh, compared
to packaged and wrapped up in pretty
clothes. But standing in front of the
mirror, preparing to show the rest ofthe
world my betterenakcd body, I wasn't so
sure.

The pimples on the back ofmy thighs.
the ones you get right underneath your
butr> They were a personal aeront The
red lines from last night’s ‘Fetish I-larris'
costume screamed, “i wear clothing
that's too right on a body that can’t pull
it off."

i thought i looked better naked
because usually, while naked, I'm too
preoccupied with the activity at hand

to actually examine my ﬂesh for all of its
oddities und leftover tan hnes and stray hairs.

So no, I didn't go to “Naked Baking"
naked. I showed up fully clothed but I walked
in to see two girls in no-pants, and one boy
sporting an apron and nothing else, i knew
them, but not in the kind ofwny that lends
itselcto comfortably removing my clothing.

I instantly regretted my choice of attire,
I just couldn't see myself taking oh” the
sweatpants and shirt I'd slipped on over my
undies, right in the middle or this kitchen.
It felt highly inappropriate, if not downright
dirty. So as a compromise, I took ortmy shtrr,
and began to bake cranberry chocolate chip
cookies wearing a tank top and sweat pants.

Thus began the prolonged strip tease. I
put back on my shirt, and took off my pants,
And then I took oer my shirt, so that l was

wandering around in my most conservative
black panties and a tank top. And then
ﬁnally, ten minutes before leaving,I took
ort that binding last shirt, and hated my
lace—covered nipples to the world.

The funny thing is, the cliche is true.
Being almost—naked was liberating. i
laughed at the way my butt shook while
1 stirred the dough. l bent over to get the
cookie sheet from beneath the oven and
noticed the exact muscles that tense in my
thighs in that position

I wasn’t worried how these almostt
strungets saw my body. And I wasn't
worried about how I saw it, either, It was
tliereipatt of the decoration. No better
and no worse than anyone clse's. 1 think
ncxt time I’ll lose the bra, too.

Fat Acceptance Discussion |Younker Lounge | Monday, November 16

l examined my body carefully
yesterday when I was preparing to
broadcast it to the world at Eco House,
but I felt more self-conscious of it
tonight, sitting fully clothed in Younker
Lounge. 1 was distinctly aware of the
two cookies, piece of cake, slice of pie
and three chocolate kisses sitting in my
stomach. i felt the waist of my jeans
biting into my protruding belly.

I felt fat.

So it was a good thing i was sitting
at a fatrucceptznc: discussion. Except
that I don’t identity as fat. I recognize
rhar, to the rest of the world, my body
is ﬁne. It is attractive even, for those

who appreciate the exaggerated cokkboltle
shape.

Yet sitting in Younker, l was fat. Partly
because I’ve got the curves to claim it, and
partly because of the speeitic mood 1 was in.
It depends on what exactly is weighing on
my stomach and how much l’ve worked out
and what jeans l’irl wearingieven who l've
hooked up with lately and how it went.

We talked about this issueﬁone's
personaltidentiﬁcatlon versus society’s
deﬁnition of them. We also talked about
how society attaches other stereotypes to fat
people, and I realized 1 subscribe to a lot of
them.

In fact,l connect being fat wtth a lot of

things about myself that I don't like~my
lack of sclfecontrol, the obnoxious, loud,
insecure aspects or” my personality and
my inability to change my own body.

Fat acceptance is about moving away
from these ugly and untrue stereotypes.
It’s not about accepting unhealthy and
potentially dangerous lifestyles, it just
shifts the emphasis from skinny to
healthy, which is something achievable at
a wide range ofweights.

The discussion wrapped up on a note
or politically incorrect laughter, “In my
country if you've got curves and a big
ass, you’re worth more cows," called out
Nadine Baranshamay'e ’11.

Female-identified Masturbation Workshop | Main Lounge 1 Wednesday, November 18

Masturbation is a touchy subject
for me. While male masturbation was a
main topic of conversation all through
high school, the idea of girls servicing
themselves was beyond taboo.

My own hesitancy to discuss
masturbation stemmed from the fear of
being the only one to do iterhe only one
who had sexual urges and the only one
who was able to express them without a
partner.

Turns out, I’m not the only one. The
masturbation workshop assuaged all of
my high school tears of being deviant
or out oftlie ordinary in any way. By the
end of it,l was almost worried that I’m
unoriginal in my methods, experience
and the supposedly uncommon settings

in which I’ve practiced them.

Unoriginality wasn’t really my main
concern though, to be honest. Instead, I spent
most of the hour and a half discussion wishing
desperately that somebody had sat me down
tor this conversation {our years ago.

If somebody had actually discussed
masturbation with me,I could have begun the
exploration of my body with self-conﬁdence
and curiosity, instead of confusion and
emblm‘assment. ,

We were still embarrassed tonight, but it
wasn'tbom from feeling dirty or inappropriate.
Rather, it was the embarrassment that comes
when discussing something that is deeply
intimate.

The intimate details of my sex life were
aired as we talked about the different things

that we did to get off, and I brought up
what I thoughtvm a strange turn-on.

Despite the fact that l identify as a
straight female, I fantasize about girl-on-
girl, boy-oneboy, and occasionally girl—om
boy-on-boy interactions. Not many other
girls in the circle related to this, but I did
learn that there’s been a whole study on
how women get turned on by all sexual
activity, regardless of orientation.

I found myself laughing—is nothing
I do weird or unheard of? Still, my sutunl
uniqueness matters less to me than just
knowing what I like. After all, as the
masturbation 101 handout told us, “It's
important to know what excites YOU.” So,
yon—go ﬁgure it out, And if you already
know, practice it.
