Faith, family and freedom—and apple pie

Republicans may be rare on campus, but not in town. Sen. Sam Brownback (R»Kan.) and
lowa Rep. Steve King came to town last Saturday to fire up loyal conservatives

Patriotic music blares from a karaoke mas
chine. Pictures of national monuments and
a kitschy American ﬂag made of Christmas
lights line the wall. Portraits of the president
and visaspresident frame the “stage," where
the speaker stands in front of the state and
national ﬂags. Food is served, church potluck
style, from crock pots and large aluminum
trays, and the apple pie is nothing
short of amazing. This can mean
only one thing: a dinner held
by the Poweshiek County Re—
publicans, complete with special
guests senator sam Brownback
(RsKansas) and Representative
Steve King (km).

The crowd seems like the
typical small-town Republican
voter of the past few elections:
white, middlesaged, married and
patriotic.

Brownback spoke clad in a sweater vest
that allowed him to come off like a cross be
tween Mr. Rogers and Ned Flanders, the per-
fect family man. His brief 10 minute speech
stuck to the same core values that have fos—
tered his rise in support among social comer,
vatives, emphasizing "the basics of America:
faith, family, [and] freedom."

“If we get them right, we soar," he said. “If
we get them wrong, we sink." This means a
constitutional amendment on gay marriage, a
ﬂat tax for all Americans, and a major cracks
down on illegal immigrants.

Brownback received a lukewarm response,
though, possibly because supporters were dis-
appointed with the truncated length of the
speech, possibly because Brownback himself
had been oh the campaigning intensely all day

and Grinnell was
the last stop.

"I couldn’t res
member anything he said," said attendee Tom
Pierce.

It took King to really fire up the crowd.

King spoke to the same core values that
Brownback emphasized. but with more zeal

and ﬁery rhetoric; he drew the crowd in,
speaking for over forty minutes to a
rapt audience.

“We need to build a
wall, a double wall," he said
regarding illegal immigras
tion. “We need to force
all cargo, legal and illegal,
through the ports."

to then moved to gay
marriage, inspired by the
recent decision of a Polk
county judge to legalize

gay marriage in low.

“Marriage is not a right, it's
a permit," he said, arguing that per-
mitting gay mars
riage would send Iowa into
a tailspin matched only by
the horrors currently taking

place in Massachusetts.

King seemed convinced
that legalizing gay marriage
would cost “thousands of
marriages" and would turn
lowa into “a mecca from
all over the country the
rainbow Las Vegas for mars
riage in this nation.”

With a state constitutional amendment uns
likely to appear on the ballot until at least 2010,
King maintained that the only way to success-
fully end this danger is through a constitution-

Campai

States Congress.”

”The only plate we ram (055 that
war is an the ﬂoor ofthe United

. al amendment

0 Republicans in Congress.

Even though the

amendment has failed every time, this crowd

didn't seem to care, cheering King‘s proposal to
uphold marriage and keep their lives normal.

Moving down the list ofissues written on
his hand, King ﬁnally reached the elections
core issue: Iraq.While many Grinnellians may
he cut off from those who still support the war,
they exist, and King knew exactly how to pink
der to them: blame the Democrats for their
cut-and-run tactics.

“The only place we can lose that war is on
the ﬂoor ofrhc United states congress,"l<ing
said. He referred to the questioning ofGeneral
David Petraeus that had occurred during the
week in Congress, and talked about how he
sought the help of the thesaurus so he could
call the Democrats rreasonous without using
the Constitutional deﬁnition.

In all, his argument came down to the core
Republican argument of the war: fighting over
there will prevent attacks from occurring over

here. Fear again. Regardless
ofhow the war is going, the
fear card is one that Re»
publieans can always play
“Don't think about how
the war is going," they say,
“think about what would
happen if the United States
left."A takeover by Iran. Al-
CLaeda's return, Greater dan»
ger for Israel. A total loss of
control. It's enough to make
Ted Kennedy vote Republican.

Dan ”The Colonel" Bunnell, director of
forensics at Grinncll, was one of the attendees

Grinnell’s
caucus
problem

Key political event is
scheduled to occur before
dorms open this January

Few students on campus now were
here for the 2004 presidential caucuses, but
many have heard stories from now»gradu-
atcd friends about how exciting it was to be
a part of such an important political event.
This January will bring another compet‘r
tive caucus, but an early date may make it
difficult for students to participate.

The scheduled mucus is forjan. 14, five
days before residence halls open.This is the
first time in recent memory that the dorms
will be closed for the caucuses, and so far
the administration has made no plans for
student early reentry

This is a great concern for political ac-
tivists on campus. “At Grinncll we have so
many students that work tirelessly," said
Alec schietenbeck ’09, president of the
College Democrats of Iowa. “[For] them
to be denied this once in a lifetime oppor-
tunity I think would be to deny a part of
Grinnell’s identity. ”

schierenbeck and other campus Dems
ocrats are currently working with Jennifer
Krohn, dean for Student Life, and other
members of the administration to try to
negotiate early arrival for students in some
capacity. Krohn declined to comment for
this article, saying in an email that at this
point, she did not have any information to
share.

Students and the administration are
still in early stages of talks, but Schierens
beck thinks students will be able to return
to town early one way or another, even if
they are not allowed into dorms. “Frankly,"
he said, “even if there isn’t an accommodas
tion with the college, we’re going to find
ways to allow people to come back early."
