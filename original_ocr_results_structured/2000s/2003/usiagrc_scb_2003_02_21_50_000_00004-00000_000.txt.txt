it ran be easy to forget that the Internet is a very public world where
anyone, anywhere can see what anyone else posts. This weekend Grinncl-
lians were r:m|nd:d ofthe public nature ofthe Net when they found their
smalled privacy compromised in the webelsed Plans system.

users of the system update their "plan," a sort of online iournsl, with
whatever material they want to post, and read the plans oforhers with the
help of an “autoftnget list" of their favorite plans, Last Saturday night
Daren Brantley ’04 wrote a program that made it possible for students to
see who had their plans on their autohnger lists. With Brantley’s script,
users could easily learn. for the first time, who read
their plan regularly.

When anllcy found the code that did die job
he posted a link to the hack on his plan went to
bed. in the morning he met up with Jonathan
Kenslcr ’04, who runs Plans. H: showed Kcnslcr
the link, diey laughed and then anrley removed
the link from his plan. Meanwhile, however, oLher
studenn had seen and posted the link on their own
plans, so students continued to use Branley’s pmr
gram.

As they discovered Biantley's program. some stu.
dents felt that their privaoy had been invaded and
that it had created a security problem in the plans
system. Some students, however, had known for a
while that such a trick was pmlblHBrantlcy wasn't the first to try to
treate the program to allow students to view autofinget lists.

“The way most people have been doing it is by hacking into the dams
base," Brantley explained. “[1] wrote [the piogiaml because a lot oirhose
people, I think, don't really know their way around a database system, i
thought it would keep people from logging into the database and at the
satne time push Jonathan to make the system more secureand it just got
out ofhand."

Brantley and others emphasized that Plans are not as private or secure
as some may think and that rho incident is an :xampl: ofiust how public
plans really are.

“I think that students think the.e's a lot more privacy than there is,"
said Brantley, “There‘s an idea that your plan only has a primte audienee
and so looking at a plan of somebody you don't know is kind of like
reading their diary, sticking your nose in their private life "

The myth of private life?

A student-programmed tool intended to demonstrate a technical error in the Plans system
touches off a controversy over the nature of, and right to, privacy on the web

in aetualrry, plans are very much a publie forum, aeressible to anyone
with an lntetnet connection. Brantley noted that. for example. Plans are
indexed on Google

Even among users who acknowledged that plans are public, some felt
that Biantleys discovery was not handled In the best manner. James
Michael Hill 04 said that Brantley eould have provided students with
proof that the code existed by allowing students to see who viewed his
own plan,

“nutofinger lists aren't meant to be viewed by the general public,"
Michael-Hill said

Mosi users operate under the pretense that whose
plans they read is a private thing, he said: making
the link available was "kind ora betrayal of trust."

However, Jaeob Kaufmali»05bom '04 argued
that Brantley "didn't do anything wrong by writing
[die codel," aldiough he aeknowledged that “using
it is probably not sueh a good idea "

Kauimanosborn argued on his plan that pose
ing die seripr was not inherently wrong. All that
does, he wrote, is provide “an avenue for someone
toaeses informationifslhesodesires."Hewent
on to say that, since Plans are a public system, using
voluntary file sharing programs like Napster or
Phyiid is similar to using Enntlcys strips

it is unfairand illogial to blame [Biantltyl and
useand praise Phynd at thesame time," hesaid. “If
you're going to say that a program that does a ‘bad‘ thing is wrong make
sure you say the same about all programs that do ‘bad' things "

John stone, Computer scienee, offered two suggestions for ensuring
the future seeurity ofthe plans system. one fis, hesatd, would be to set up
aseparate database server forstoting plans. This way only those who work
on Plans maintenance would have access to the Plans files, His other sug.
gestion was to “run the programs that aeetss the Plans database in aspeeid
‘safe mode” set up to solve seeutiry problems with shared servers.

stone said that he prefers the first option, and Brantley and Mlzhzidr
Hill seemed to indiiate that a new server would indeed be the solution to
Plans setutrry pioblems.

it is not expected that the link will be posted again

"I didn't mean for it to be such a big thing," brantley said. “I think
people need to know the truth and I don't think that they should be fore
stalled on this preretise ofsccurity and privacy,"

Funding process

Funds, cont. from p. 3

trons could be considered on more even terms.

Thcsc days Osgood reserves his remaining cash foroom»
pletely “unexpected and unbudgerable" projects like the
Trinana trip and the cricket broadeast.

Even this new centralization hasn‘t solved every prob.
lem, Osgood said. in 2000, his ﬁrst full year as president.
an over-budget Grinncll singers tour of Eastern Europe
had exhausted his newly-shrunk disereiionary fund in one
fell swoop. Sinor then, he requires a spceific budget, with
contact iniormation, rrorn everyone who asks him for
money.

Tom Beaudm '03, who as SPARC’s bioiness manager
approved handing for Kirkwood's book of photographs.
said his experience with that protect led him to a similar
eontliision,

“After a protect like that goes bad, there is no way to
rteoiip the money," he said. Future SPARC protects, he
said, should be rigorously planned and biidgetod before
any money goes out. so future committees wouldn't be
obliged to keep investing in a repeatedlyexpanding project.

Even budgetary rigor, though, wont be able to provide
for every application, Osgood said With a limited set of
ﬂexible iunds in the colleges huge budget, students look
ing ior short term financial assistance can only eut costs
and hope for the best

“Not every good idea is un emergeney," said the prcsir
dent “There are more good ideas on this aim pus than we
can fund,"

The tnost important eharaetetistic ofsuccessful grants,
administrators said, is that thcyeannot be funded by any.

from otlicrsourcs, applicanu may find themselves passed
around the campus in a game uihseal hot potato,

The best way to estape that cycle. administrators agreed
is to have a proieet that‘s either academiially useful orsoiiie.
how important to the mission of the college. it also helps if
you have preeedenr at your back, either in the form ofa
longstanding eampus tradition or a longestablished stu
dent group

ultimately, however, the iunding protess is one otedur

well.

“There's a point when: you have a high level of trust,"
he said, “That goes with salfrgoverndnce and having an
open currieiilum. I think students are worth every penny
we can put in "
