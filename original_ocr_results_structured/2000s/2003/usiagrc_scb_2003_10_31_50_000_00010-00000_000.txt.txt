The world of HAIR, full of sex, drugs, political activism and nudity is reminiscent of the lifestyles of many Grinnellians.

Perhaps the reason that HAIR resonates with
so mdny here is heenuse Grinnellians often see
the world of HAIR as Similar In their own The
show npens tvirh “The Age oerusrius,“ the
musical number llmr many in the cast call "orgy
rifle." This introduction is only the beginning of
the mnny rtnirs thnt mak: HAIR nddly ﬁtting for
Grinnell.

The basic plot, without giving ntvny the
ending, is as follows: in 1968 New York, o group

Otren, this simply enrnils n lnt ofsex end drugs.
The character Claud: shows up and he is not

Tribe and he begins to live with Berger nnd
Sheila, a enuple in n rocky relnrionshtp. The show
progresses es the male ehareerers get their drttr
notices. The story eentrrs on Clouds, who gets
his draft erud and is tnniiiered ebout what type or
hie to lead. The story niso Focuses on how eneh
member oftheTtib: deals with his or her own
situations and how Claudc's decisions affect the
Tribe.

Tribe tones in HAJRsre nnnlogous to prnblems

Emily Danielson ‘06 (Shells) snid, “HAIR has n
really powerful message thrt 1 reel like only this

The nudity in the show is slsn quite ﬁtting
