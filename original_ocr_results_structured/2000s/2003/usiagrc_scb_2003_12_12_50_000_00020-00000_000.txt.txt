Both the men's and women's basketball teams will be traveling to
Colby college in Mame over the winter break. Both teams fly out Dec,
31 to play the college and return on Jan. 4. The men and wonien will
be taking this trip because Colby is inen's head tooth Dave
Alseneaull's alma mater and he promised his old coach that he would
take the Pioneers to play Colby before the Eolby coach retired. The
Maine weather will certainly be a change iron the warm weather or
the usual winter vacatlan spots or Florida or California, but the team
understands the coach's loyalties.

“We're looking forward to going out their, beeoiise colliy plays in a
really tough tonrerenee, and they should be one of our top opponents
this year,” said Paul Nordlund '05. "Other than that, we look forward
to rnreting coach's frat brothers from so years ago. Hoperully, they'll
tell us all the stories tllat math won't tell us." — Kevin Byrne
