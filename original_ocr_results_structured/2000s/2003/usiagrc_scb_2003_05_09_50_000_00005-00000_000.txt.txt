Ending on a good note

Grinnell Symphony Orchestra, Singers and Community Chorus Collaborate to
perform Beethoven's Ninth Symphony in Darby this Sunday

by Carly Schuna

Doug Diamond, conductor ofrhe Grinnell Symphony orchestra, is
llghlrllppcd about the message behind Beethoven’s Ninth symphony.

“I'd love to [say]' but I can't," said Diamond. “I’m saving it for a pre-
concert talk, ifl can get a piano moved into Darby for the event."

The event is the upcoming performance ofBeethoven's Ninth Sym-
phony by the Grinneil Symphony Orchestra, the Grinncll Singers, and
the Grinncll Community Chomskl‘he concert was rescheduled from April
25 and 27. and will now take place in Derby Gymnasium on Sunday,
May l l , at 2 pm,

A timeless piece

Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is air enormously popular classical com-
position, universally renowned for in technical excellence and unusually
long duration. “There's nothing else quite like [it] in the orchestral Tapers
mire," said Diamond, “Thework really is a triplewhammy: tlrcsize, length,
thTlllcs, and the nvelltyrlive minute finalc with chorus and soles added
are all historically unprecedented in symphonic writing."

The not ' com plcxiry and cohesiveness are especially evident as the
piece piogresscs. “The extent ofhasie motivic development throughout
all loiii movements is astonishingly high; and the entire group of four
movements was conceived as a single, philosophical dialectic on one of
the most basic of natural human concerns. A work of art like [that] is
ctpceied to be rirnclcss,“ Diamond stated.

impairist Abb Arnold '03 agreed. “Beethoye Ninth is a classic
piece of music," she s cl, “The ‘Odc to loy' section is known by almost
c one, even thosewithoutclassictl training For enthusiasts, the Ninth
is the beginning ofa trend ullcd
organic growth in classical
music. Also, the Ninth
goes into great depth
about humanity and
the brotherhood we

shorild all cherish,"

Beethoven’s inspiration

For many, what is most intriguing about Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony
is that it was writtcn while the famous composer was almost completely
deaf The idea of such a musical fear is daunting at ﬁrst, but seems plau-
sible when explained by Diamond.

“[lt's] acrually a lor less bathing in purely technical terms than it might
at first seem; any decent professional musician with a well-trained inner
ear ean hear music in his or her head to varying degrees ofaccuracy. and
Beethoven was considerably more than just a decent professional," said
Diamond.

Diamond also proposed that “the more interesting question is how
anyone... could have conceived ofsuch a work in the first place." No one
knows for sure, but Diamond has his own opinion on the subject, “[I
think] that the guy was able to conceive of it precisely because of» rather
than in spite of— his deafness," Diamond contended “I’ve a fairly strong
hunch that had the composer's hearing remained unimpaired, Western
music would forevei be withoutsome ofits most remarkable treasures."

john Rommereim. conductor of the Grinncll Singers and Grinnell
Community chorus, echoed Diamond's words. “it seems as ifBeethoven's
deafness, though it was a heavy, painful blow to him, also had some pme
found effects on his art," Rommetcim said, “When Communlmtion is a
struggle, [one is) less likely to waste... effort on trivial expression. and
more likely to focus on things ofsubstarrce,"

The performance

Romnrereim explained thatwhile the first performance ofsomerhing
such as Beethoven's Ninth Symphony would be intensely practiced and
perfected today, that wasn't the case in the 1800’s. “When the Ninth Symr
phony was [originally] premiered, the chorus was about the same size as
the chorus in this concert. and it was made up of amateur singers," said
Rommcrcii-n.

The concert was also not up to today's rigorous technical standards.
“[ltj was a poor performance by modern standards," Rommereim said.
“The music was woefully under—rehearsed. Audiences tr the time were
perhaps less focused on technical perfection than... listening through the
performance to hear the artistic vision ofthe composer."

The original performers also received personal thanks from Beethoven
himself. “After the premiere, as the chorus ﬂied out, Beefhovm grcttcd
each ofthtm with an embrace," Rommcrcim Smtcd. “I think ichcthoven
were here. he would embrace the performer: in Sunday's concert in thanks
for (hair hard work and dedication."

Lengthy anticipation
“I’m incredibly excited [for the perfornranoej." said
Rachel Brummel ’03, principal French horn player
, for the Grinncll Symphony orchestra. “Ifwe
\ play well, this ootild be an amazing perfor»
v' / mince."
l Sarah Alward '03, concert mistress,
. agreed with Brummel. “Beethoven’s
re ./ Ninth is one of the most amazing pieces
evcrwrirten, so it's pretty incredible to get
to play it in my lot eoneert," she said. “I
just hope that we can all keep up the en.
ergy and enthusiasm for the hour and a
half it should take to get through the
whole piece."
Brummel also expressed concern at
the length of Beethoven’s Ninth. “The
most difficult part is the physical and men»
tal endiirauiee it takes to perform this piece,
andl haven't even done it all in one sitting yet,
You have to be paying attention at all times, even
when you no nor playing."
brummcl seemed very excited, however, about
playing beethoven's Ninth at her last Grin-
nell performance “I know that i
am going to reel emotional when
I play the last note of my college
orchestra citrecr , and thatTHAT
note is the last note ofbccthosen's
Ninth," she said. “I’m glad l’m
going out with a bang,"

Concert Preview

Grinnell College Jazz Band
Friday, May 9
7:30 p.m. in Sabrina-Lewis

0n fri. May 9. Sehrlng~Lewis Hall will take a
breather from the serious and carefully rehearsed
notes of most student recitals. Instead, student
instrumentalists will be making it up as they go
along.

"That’s what the music is about:
improvisation," said Jazz Band Director Brent
Sandy,

The songs, drawn from the standard jazz
repertoire, will consist of two big band tunes and
four combo tunes played in smaller groups. The
piece that the bond is looking forward to playing
most is “Work Song” by the famous jazz musician
Cannonball Adderley, Sandy describes the song as
having "a funky groove... suuljazz with nice
harmonies to improvise over."

Colin Seiler '04 will kick off the piece with an
unaccompanied guitar solo and is "excited and
nervous to see how it goes. I don't want to flub
it!" '

Colin Tschida '05 is more conﬁdent, claiming,
"we’re going to work it good."

Seiler said that most of the members are good
friends outside of the band, Sandy also
emphasized that the band is close-knit and
members have conﬁdence in their ability to work
together.

However, as Sandy pointed out, "The bond is
not only a fun situation and a family
environment, but also an educational
environment." Despite their light-heartedness,
being in jazz band is a serious commitment and
requires unique musical skills, notably the ability
to improvise during concerts.

According to Sandy, who directs four jazz
bands during the school year, Grinnellians are
particularly well suited to jazz. ”They are
intellectual, articulate and openeminded, which
has a lotto do with being able to play the
music. They are attracted to the opportunity to
play creative music, improvisational music. a
different stylistic type of musict”

"[The band members] are playing some
challenging music on a very high level," he said.
"Each and every musician is showing growth."

Seller joined jazz hand because ”the
experience of playing together is just
invaluable.” Playing jazz fostered in him a
”curious musical appetite" that made him want
to learn more about different styles of music, he
said.

In this performance, Grinnell Jazz Band will
face the challenge of not only improvising in the
traditional jazz style but also develop their own
unorthodox techniques to compensate for their
limited diversity of instrumentalists. ”What
people might call a limitation, we can use to our
advantage," Seiler said.

The group doesn't have a bass player, and ”our
rhythm section is me and the drummer," said
Seiler, who often plays bass lines in addition to
the traditional guitar part. "It forces me to be
much more accurate and know what 1 am
playing, and it makes me a much better player."

The musicians devote themselves to their
music both for their own sake and for that of
their director, "We love Brent very much, but we
don’t want to be called out for not having
practiced," said Seiler. "He is a really good guy,
knows his stuff, really knows how to direct."

Tschida sums up what drew him to jazz band in
simple terms: "I love jazz. I love playing jazz. I
love being with people who love to play jazz,"

The concert program "rocks...I mean swings.“
he joked.
