“our group worked with Habitat for
Humanity, putting up siding, installing
windows, creators," said Michele Goad ‘07.
“[We] also worked with Salvation Army and
cleaned out a men's shdtcr and helped set
up for the winter."

The unique communal living cxperi»
encc Alternative Break
provides was familiar to
some participants, “1
come from a country
where people survive by
relying upon one another,
cithcr by a system or ex-
trcmcly extensive ex-
tended families or by
forming groups that are
similar to what you call
troops here," said Lenta
Yolranncs ‘05, an international student from
Ethiopia.

Yohanncs was able to explore not inter.
ests more thoroughly through the trip than
she’d been able to in past experiences. “I
volunteered at dirrcrcnt places when l was
in high school and I’ve wanted to particlv
pale in service projects here but a demand»
ing schedule has not allowed me to fully
immerse myself in it," she said. “So I
thought this would be a great introduction
to Hahitat for Humanity. I‘ve always been
interested in working with them.

“In nddltion," Yohannes continued. “I
Wanted to do ‘rcal’ work, I've been to too
many service programs wherci eithcrduc
to my inexperience or an overabundance
of volunteersi I have not been allowed to

experienc

again."

”I had such a great

would love to do it

truly work I thought that Alternative Brcak
was a wonderful medium to take willing
volunteers to wherever the need is found,"

Codeader Rose Wilson ‘06 also found
rdtcrnntive break to bcvcryprocluclive, “We
saw the changes in the building: we were
working on, and the generosity of the
church and community in Mankaro was
inspiring," she said, “I
ritualstr very proud otall
the participants. When
they were bored they
found work to do, and
when they were tired the
kept a positive attitude."

“I intend to participate in Alternative
Break again because it is such a unique and
altruistic endeavor and hccausel might he

Wilson's co.leader Matthew Ptiaum ‘00.

way to feel like youarc actually doing some
thing as fat as community service goes,"

rundmising sometimes is. You are a part of
the community and the proper you are
working on,"
