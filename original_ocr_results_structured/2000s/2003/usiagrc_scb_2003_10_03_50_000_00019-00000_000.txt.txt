On Sunday, Sept. 14, the men's rugby team faced a
dimcult reality They had been suspended for the year by
the lawn Rugby Union's executive board for failure [0 hand
in its player certiﬁcation dues in e nrnely manner.

Mosr of the players had expeered the executive board
to take acrion to punish rhe rearn. but they lud’nnly exs
pccrcd thern to suspend the team for
eight days, which is the standard punr
ishrnenr levied for breaking rules in
rugby

“My lrnrncdiarc reaction was nur

ingly broken the rules, but it felt it had
done everything in irs power to got the

In fact, the (mi-n wasn't even able to hold
a practice until almost two weeks after
the union dues were supposed to be
turned in

“We’re a colleg: team. “06:: no( a

he felt diar rhe league should give a few weeks extension 10

added that it was extremely drificulr for college teams lik:
Grinncll and Central to rum in their CIPP (Certifiution

However, lows Rugby Union sccrcraiy Dan

an incident from rhc pmviom year's all—Iowa rournnrnenr,
where only five ofihcir fifteen players were registered with
the union. “My understanding is thathremiali [Johnsom
the union president] said ‘We'll let you [Grinnell] play in

“I understand they're waiting for people to show up,“

he said. “bur they didn't even have one

Differing
opinions

The Griiliiell rugby team and
the union's executive board
don’t exactly see eye to eye
on this issue. Each side’s
main points ave below.

Gnnnoil rugby says:
- Grinnell was suspended
because they didn't turn in
their ClPF certiﬁcation on
time and played with
untertiﬁed players

~ Eight days is the standard
suspension

- College teams like
Grinnell need an extension
to get their players
together

- Theie seems to be a
grudge against urinneil
rugby by a certain member
of the exncutlve board

The executive board says:
- Griniiell was suspended
because they needed to
have 15 players certified,
and they had none

I The boald had no chuite
but to suspend Grinnell for
the entire year

~ Grinnell got an extension
dating back to Last year
that they failed to take
advantage or

' The entire board voted
unanimously to suspend the
team for a year, so the
personality dispute between
the boaid membei and the
Grinl'iell coach had no
bearing on the decision
