Rant apology

I apologize ro rhe Grinnell cummunrry and parricrrlariy ro rhe
vierims ofrhe sexllnl usarilrs and choir close friends ror my insensirive
scaiemenrs rn rhe Ocr lo 5&3. I was misinformed aborrr rhe narure
ofrhc crimes and I failed ro research rhe crimes or consider my srarce
nrcnrs carefully I did nor rnrend ro offend or hurr anyone rhrough
my commenrs i did nor rhinh rhai an informal random rani would
severely ofrend peoplc because a random rain is uiidersrood ro be
somerhing char is wrirren on rhe spur ofrhe momenr as opposed ro
somerhing carefully rhoughr our. My choice ofwords such as “bo-
geyman" and “spam" were inrended as pare orrhe narure ofa random
ranr, iaihcr rhan acarcfrrllyconsidercd opinion in realiry, crimes are
definiiely not commirred by begeymen The emails and posrers from
security were nor spam, brrr rarhcr imporcani informarion. I do nor
mind having ro carry my Pecard around. Evenrs offeamprrs do, and
should, have an impacr on campus lire. Had l known people would
have ralcen rhe ranr so seriously, or had I bccn berrci informed as re
rhe narure of rhe crimes, 1 would nor have expressed my opinions on
rhe increased secuiiry in a ram, bur rarher in a carefully worded and
thoughtcout lerrer ro rhe ediror, irar all.

Based on rhe minimal descriprion ofche crima given in rhe Sepr
19 secs, which neidaer referred ro rhe crimes m rapes or arremprcd
rapes nor menrioned ro whar extent rhe vicrims were physically in»
jurcd, I was unable in properly gauge rhe narure orrhe crimes, Per»
haps I should have inferred somerhing more {ram ch: police chiefs
use of rho word “serious" in his rerse descriprion, bur insread my
opiimisric narure gor rhe berrerorme In Ohio, where I'm from, rhc
law names rypes ofscxual assauhs dinerenrly from lowa law in pare
ocular, ro rhe besr ormy knowledge, ifs reone is sexually assaulred
in any way rhar involves 2 penerrarion, i s referred ro as a rape and
she newspapers reporr is as such, whereas Iowa law uses rhe rerm
“sexual assaulr" ro rerer re many crimes ofvarying levels of severicy
including rapes. When I heerd that thesc snideirrs had been sexually
assaulred i figured rhe crimes were nor rapes or arren-ipied rapes and
did nor involve physically impairing violence or else I would have
heard rhem referred ro as rapes or arremprcd rapes or heard more
dcrails abour how badly rhc vicrims were injured. This is nor ro say
char a rape is rhe only rype ofscxuai assaulr char can be rraumaric, on
die eonrrary, all scxunl assarilrs can be emorionally rraumaric, even if
rhey involve neirhcr pcnerrarion nor physically impairing violence.
Even ifche crimes had indeed been of rhe narure I’d imagined, my
commcnrs would have been insensinve, brrr nor ro rhe same degree.
My misundersranding ofrhe crimes narures helps ro explain why I
made such inapproprrare commenrs,

Furrhermore, i did not mean ro say rhar ihe crimes did nor dc.
mand any addirronal securiey, bur rarher (bar 1 was concerned abour
the ways in which we increased securiry. I was parricuiariy concerned
abour rown police using the sicuarion as an excuse ro increase rheir
presence on campus. I used the alcohol—relared crrarion as an example
ofonc ofrhe negarive rmpacrs ofrhis increased presenceThis is prob.
ably rhe mose concrere negarrve impaer we've experienccd so far, bur
iris by no means rhe only one possible, in general, an increased pee
lice presence anywhere will lead ro an increased possibiliey {or viola»
(ions of privacy and unfairly discriminarory enforcemenr ofrhe law,
our campus, rhough cerrainly pan of rhe rewn, is also selfgovern.
ing, As a civil liberrarian and a believer in selrgovcrrrarrce, l was nor
comforrable wirh (own police srcpping in ro solve a problem rhar
could possibly be handled berrer by campus secuiicy. However, given
rhar rhe rown police have rypcs and amounrs ofrcsources unavailable
ro campus securiry. and given rhar rhese crimes were more severe

Grinnel and Iowa
are Ideologically
diverse

As borh an ahrm and now an employee or Grinnell College, 1
read wirh borh rnreresr and skepricism abour che “spurred debare"
over “ideological diversity" rhar rvns reporrad in rhe lasr issrrc orrhe
8&8.

Who: I round rnesr rnrercsiing was nor rhe impliearron rhar
crrnnell does nor already possess a diverse range or ideologies, nor
wherhar icwould in facr be in rhe college’s bear rnreresr ro increase irs
ideological diversiry, nor even how rhe College would ser abour :ch
tempting ro arrracr srirdenis ofa less "lefrclibcml orientation," ale
rhough rhese all are imporranc nucsrions,

No, i found ii mosr rnreresring rhar rhe discussion ofrdeological
diversiry was rramed in rhe comexr of“cnhancing our connecrion ro
lowa," as rhough rhe College rnrisr become more “rrghr” or “conscr—
varivc" ro march rhe .esr of Iowa. 1 feel rhar rhis iniplicarion._rhar
rhe resr of ihe srare oflowa does nor have a “lefcliberal orienrarionL
is nor accuiare Iowa's senarors and rcprcsenrarives in rhc us legisla.
rurc arc a mix or Democracs and Republicans, liberals and
conscrvarives. And lowa vorers have nvice elecred Democrar Tom
Vilsack as rheir governor, who hiu responded re rho desires of his
consrrruenrs by pursuing such “lien-liberal" agendas as improving
public schools, proiecring rhe eiivrronrnenr, expanding healrhcare
coverage and supporiing women's healrh and reproducuve righrs.

lr seems ro me ihar lowa has a mix oridcologies, bur char cur»
renrly ir seems ro lean a lirrle more ro rhe lefr rhan ro rhe righc And
I woirld argue rhar Grinnell College is roughly die same—ideologi—

Reconsidering
a leftist campus

I read with no small rnreresr rhe brief news arricle published in
lasr week's 5&1}, “Triisrees warn ideological diversiry." Regardless of
ourcome, l’m relieved rhar rhis issue is finally on rhe rahle arrer years
orapparenr neglecr and denial. Afeer all, is anybody really surprised
rhar Grinnell has “an image of lacing reo narrow in rrs lcﬁ-libcml
orientation"?

Addressing Crinnell's lack ofideological diversiry need nor even
be a moiccr ofrrghr erwrong, bur simpic Padagogy: rhe college has
done in srudcnrs and alumni an edrrcarional disservice by insiilaring
us from rhe views erhundrcds ofmillions ofpcople. How orrcn have
you argued wirh a genuinely conservarive viewpornr in class? When
was rhe lasr rrme a prolifc or rree market demonsrrarion was held on
campus.> Ever made fun ofMormons or evangelical Chrrsrians. us»
ing insuhs you'd never apply ro anybody else,) lrhoughrso, (And
I've done ii coo.) When nor aerively confronied by these ideas, we
fell rnro easy habirs ofdemoniaauon and dismissal,

I was a bu fiabbergasred, rhough, by Professor Vicroria Brown's
published remarks, which were cririsal cfrhe commicree's decision,
I, for one, am pierry srrre rhar when people ml Grinnell “a lefnsr
place,” rhey mean precisely rhar, They mean. for :xarnpic. char niosi
srudenis welcome sexual proiniscuiry and oppose rhe expression of
puriran moi—alicy. Eqriaring “leﬁlst” wirh “roieranr” jusr dodges rhe
whole issue, which is rhar meyhe were nor so roleranr ofpeoplc and
messages we don’rwanr ro hear. Cultural ciiric John Derbyshire has
suggesred rhar no rnsriruiien can welcome borh homosexuality and
corrseivarrve Chrrsrianiry, one or she orher always ends up on rhe
margins. He mighc be righra rid maybe rhis kind orrradeofflies or
die hearr ofCrinnells idenriry. in any case, we don't do ourselves airy
good by precending ro be open ro ell cxperltnccs ifrhar's nor aerually
rhe (15:. Can “liberalism" be an honesr mode ofinquiry, rarher rhan
a preordained ser of prejudices like any other? I’m srill crying to
figure our rlre answer and am glad ro hear rhar rhe planning and
sreering Cornmirree is asking rhe same ouesrion,

Edwards on
campus

lam writing in response re an arricle ivriuen a couple erweelcs
ago abour senaror John Edwards' visir ro ampux, A eommenr was
made abour rhe evenr's ”terrible planning." lrwas no ones inrenr ro
inconvenience anybody wirh such a rrivral rhing as a presidenrial
candidare’s visir ro our campus. The even: was scheduled around rhe
senaror’s agenda and nor our midesemesrer examsi The rrming clearly
had no effcer on arrendance as over 200 people were presenr for rhe
evenr. in addnion, I believe rhai many would agree that a main
focus on campus is finding a candidare who can defear George Bush
in rhe upcoming elecrion. Given his background as a man who has
worked for everyrhing rhar he has roday, senaror Edimrds is more
rhan capable ofsrandrng up lmxr ro Bush as a viable mndidntc. His
plans for healrh care and idcc forcrearing jobs in rhe Unired Srares
will appeal ro many Americans. This, coupled wirh his abiliry ro ice
lare re “real people," make him rhe righr candidare ror rhe presidency
of rhe Unired scares. He knows rhe challenges Americans race in
rheir daily lives, and when he talks abour whzu he'll do for America,
irshows.
