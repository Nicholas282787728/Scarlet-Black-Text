Katie Kleese,

Measure for Measure
stage manager

No less than 25 hours a

week. No pay. Others

repeatedly questioning

'why are you doing this?’
For Katie Kleese ’05, these Come with the job.
Kleese is stage manager for Measure For Measure.
”Basically I’m in charge of making the show run
smoothly," she says. ”Making sure everything is
where it needs to be and everyone is where they
need to be. It's a lot or responsibility."

Nightly rehearsal (before tech week)
6. 40 p m.

Arrive at Roberts Theater. Sets out her paperwork
and any that the cast needs, gets ready her “big
book or the stript and all the blocking notes".
Assistant stage managers arrive to sweep and set
the stage. kleese makes sure the props are out for
the actors: it there are new props, she “gives them
straight to the actors" and talk them what they/re
for, etc.

6:A5 pm.

Takes attendance as people arrive. Rehearsals are
often staggered, so attendance taking is continu-
ous. If they don’t get there on time, ’time ﬁnes’
accumulate: “Every minute they're Late, we keep
them a minute later...it's not the best, for any of
us."

7.1 30 pm.

During rehearsal, takes extensive notes, Follows
along in script to see it the actors get any blocking
directions wrong: if they ”get things really wrong,
I'll stop them and tell them what to do". Notes
anything related to blocking, props, tasks needing
to get done, and rehearsal notes—in other words,
anything the director or actors say that could
pertain to costumes, set, or props.

10:30 pm.

Rehearsal ends. Sticks around until acturs leave,
”which is usually pretty quickly,” and asks the
director if he has any other notes to share. Asks any
questions she has.

10:50 p.m.—12 a.m.

Goes home, sits down at computer, and types up
the notes, then emails them to the cast, crew, and
designers.

12-1:30 aim.

Schoolwork. Next morning wakes up at 8 and
does work before class at 10. Weekends are the time
for big chunks of schoolwork: "I work to catch up.“

Kleese has duties outside managing rehearsals.
She is hired and gins work even before the actors
start, and heri ' al input helps shape the produce
tion. “Before auditions," she explained, "the
director and I meet and make sure that we're both
on the same page about how we want auditions to
run. I make sure that I have audition forms for the
actors and posters to advertise."

She often meets one»nrr-ane with other directors.
She'll spend preparatory time with technical
directors, learning and recording the different
lighting cues, and then spend additional time
reviewing what to say and when to say it when she
"calls a show“ by giving cues through a headset.
Kleese is also responsible for helping those actors
or crew members new to the theater know what to
expect from rehearsals and technical demands.

Kleese says she likes her job and misses it when
it’s over. "Once it‘s done," she said, ”I always feel
like I should go to the theater. Be in the theater
Its kind otlonely. ..it’s like a big happy family, and
all of sudden, we're not a family anymore.

”One of rho rhin rhii makes .1 pliya
classic is its ability to my relevani, said Chris
Connollydiedr This weekend Shakespeare’s
play Murmur/2, Murmur will be performed
in Roberts Thcatcr.

Through rho use or unique seis, music,
eosrunung, and modern social issues, Con-
nolly and his cast use rhe stage to portray rho
relevance ofshakcsprnrc’s words. They use the
show not merely to oineirain, bur to make
nudlcncc members challenge and uh quesiions
of themselves.

A (very brief) summary

simply put, the play l5 abourrr man named
Claudio who faces a dearh sentence afrei
brcaiong a law that forbids one to have sex
oursidc ormnrnnge. His sister, Isabel, is rold by LordAngolo that ifshc will
sleep with him, thus sacriﬁcing her greatest possession as a nuniher chas-
riry :lncl commilmcnt (o God—ho will ler her brother go free, Angelo is
conflicted over his love for Isabel and his more] and legal constraint: under
the hw. The play illustrates, among other things,
their struggles.

Grinnell’s unique twist

A major difference bemeen the original Shakes.
peare play and the one being performed in Roberts
Thearer this weekend lies in rho sorting. While

cast member Inga Jacob: '04, who plays lsnbcl,
grow up in Caperuwn. South Africa under the spare
heid regime and was able to bring that experience re
the play,

”Having these experiences definitely help me
with bringing a new reality to. . .rhe production,”
she said. “I think for most or the other cast mem—
bers. . .whire American or African-American, it's
Pretty difﬁcult for them to ncrlully rationalize rhis or visualize the effects
orivhnr apartheid did because it's such a ludierous regime."

There cxlsrcd r law in apartheid South Africa lulled the Immoraliry
Act that forbade sexual rolanons between people ofdifferenr races. The
law is integrated into rhc adapted version or Mr/Lrurrﬂrr Mr/ere in place
or rho low in the original version, which rorbide sexunl activity outside of

sized.

“In the Shakespeare version. Isabel is faced with a morn]
dilemma,“ sud Jacobs. “Do you save your brothers life by
sleeping wirh the authority . .or do you remain chaste and
virtuous . .[doing] whar is morally good? This is the prob.
lem she rates. {In this production] rho decisions she has ro
make are just a linlc more difﬁcult because of this racial
aspect,”

Angelo struggles. wondering how he, a racist, came to
ﬁnd himseltlusring after a black woman.

Adapting ihe play to rho apartheid sorting allows for
modern issues to be portrayed through rho nearly 400 yuan
old Script.

“[ roally like rhe fact rhnr ir's been adapted in this see.

“one thing rhar I like that's changed (in the play) is char its not simply

Jonson, too, see: the poignancy ofrhe music. “[The anthem] sets die

stage in a way and certainly it contributes a great deal emotiondly”

Racial division

“In many ways the production is about diversity
and the need for equality.” said Connelly. “That’s not
what Shakespeare is about, but that’s what this is
about”

Ironically. in order to make this poinr Connelly
had to rormln from his custom of “colorblind cost.

"For this show ir really, really mattered," Connolly
said. Isabel and Claudio had to be black; Angelo and
the Duke had in be whiie. Connelly had specificav
[ions for each character. While that could have been
very controversial. Connelly says that lr worked our
well.

“I did not encounter any sun ofrescnrmenr," said
Connolly. “The people in rho cast have been very en.
Lhusiastic about doing this."

Thankfully, the Llrcalcr doparrmoni had a diverse group to draw from.
When Connolly first arrived tour yeiis ago rhere was a lot less diveniry in
rhe dcparlmcnt.

Cast member Joseph oppang '03 remembers back to when he ﬁrst
participated in a show at Crinncll. “In rhir fusr show there were just two
black people," he said. “I think Chris has made : ior ofelron to bring

diversity ro rho lhealer."

Connelly, too. is grateful for the increased diversiry in
die depurmcnr. The racial diversity in Maumtfar Mm»
rim, however, portrays the problems facing South Africa
during the apartheid regime, The racial divisions within
the rest at: evidenr in several ways. Cosrumes scr Ll'ic rwo
groups apart. The white cast members dress proressionaily
in gray: and whites. The black list memben don colorful
costumes. Jacobs describes rhe )uxlaposirion as “black ver—
sus white; struggle versus steriliry."

The set, roo, is divided right down rhe Center. One side,
the “white" side, is Just rhal—whilc.The orhcr halfofrhe
set is covered in grifﬁn reading “Now is me limel" and
“Frecdoml” and “Viva, Mandela!" in Xhosa (pronounced
kosa), rho native language orsiiuih Africa. These phrases
capture the feelings ofprolesl porrmyed in rho play,

The objective

Apartheid laws have since been abolished. So why perform a play ser
during the apartheid regime ifir is over.> Connolly and rho as: members
cmphasim rhar while rho apartheid has been abolished, the issues and dan»
genius srrirudes ornparrheid still exist.

“It is important to understand char issues of racism, oppression, and
injustice still exist," said Oppong. “lflhis show changes even one person's
life I believe this production would have been a success."

“There are snll leclSlly issues, . ,lhcrc are srill diffcrcna: between
people," mid Jacobs, “As long as the human race exists you are going to
have these difference. For me at least, apartheid has nor died. us still
enshrined in the menrnliry of the people."

Connolly hopes to bring these issues to rho nrlcnlion ofthe audience,
“It’d be great irwo lived in a world where play: about nclsm weren'r rel»
cvanr," he said, “bur wo don'r live in rher world,"
