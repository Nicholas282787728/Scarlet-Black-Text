A game show and a girl’s story

This week the SGA movies have different takes on The Dating Game and Free Willy

by Bradley Iverson-Long and Kay Nguyen

B: Some times I really miss not being in Grinneli. All this weekend's
movies look great, except. orcourse. the French movie that I haven't
heard about, Then I remembered that hit going to London this
weekend, to visit the formerly humble sacs copy editor, and currently
boastful SSLB columnist Elise “."i. Lenssen. So you can have your Win/ll:
Rid", Harris, I’ll take a Guinness.

Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (R)

B: Finally, a movie about the making or The Gong Show. Chuck
Barris recently wrote an “unauthorized autobiography" in which he
claimed that in addition to creating popularTv game shows, he also
destroyed people's lives as a CIA operative. Now director George
Clooney, portrayor oihunky Dr. Ross, and screenwriter Charlie
Kaufman. portrayed by a crazy Nicholas Cage in Adoration, portray
Barns' (Sam Rockwell) story ordating games and death

K; Yes, the star power of this movie is phenomenal: Kaufman from
the Oscar-winning Beingjrlm Malkrul‘r/y, pretty women‘s Julia Roberts
as a darkly charming spy, George Clooncy a man ordangcr and sweet
Drew Barrymore hewired to the devil. And you'll see 5am Rockwell
rocker to stardom after this irig hit!

This look at the underbelly of the game show world follows the
career oFChuek Burris. The kid who polluted the American mind with
llls dubious entertainment turns out to be ri barrel ofCiA toxin Wesce
llls rend to perdition after he decides to lead a double life, sweeping
turmoil over Mexico, Helsinki and East Berlin while chaperoning
vacation—winning show contestants and mixing it up with a vicious
femme fatal 1c (Rohcrts) spy game, satirical comedy and romance are
nearly twisted into an intriguing plot yet we still have room for a
disturbing moral ambiguity. This crossing ofdiﬂ'cicnr genres, with its
non linear storytelling and a host oihrilliant actors, surely ducrves 115
minutes ofour precious nonehomeivork time.

B: I wish I could see this movie tonight. Instead, I’ll past have to
settle for people saying “cheerio.”

Bud's Fun Swedish Fact: Swedish people think the Swedish Chef
(rrom T/thrlP/tht) is runny, and not nxcnopllobicstcrcotypc.

Whale Rider (PG-13)

B: Without a doubt, Whit/e Rider is one oftllc 17 best movies I have
seen this year Parker (Keisha Castlc<Hughcs) is a Maori preteen girl
whose name and trihal role helongs to man, Her grandfather Koto, the
leader of the faltering tribe, is sealehing for the next leader, the next
whale rider. His Search among the tribe's ﬁrst born sons excludes Pnikcn,
who struggles relentlessly for Koro's approval and love. Throw in a soenc
with the electric slide, and you have this year's best movie about whale
riding.

The movie is adorable! Very feminist, very inspiring. 1 like the
kiw sh atmosphere, it's wild, treespirired and fascinating. New
Zealand’s exotic landscape is beautifully depicted. This is one ofthis
year's sweet surprises from independent movies. like My Big Fat Cree/c
Mdding last year.

B: I agree, although this ﬁlm’s far better than My Big For Green

\Vrddmg. castleHughes is amazing in this movie, Her struggle is a hit
cliche girl-makesegood, but she is both emotional and strong. Without
her determined performance, this crowdeplensing conquest would hc as
dreary as any ofHollywood’s summer movies. so see this film, but
mainly for the cute lz.ycar.old. Wow, this sounds like my review or
Spellbnundlast week.

Sous [e Sable

Under the Sand (NR)

B: under my radar.

K: Well, 1 love the language! Plus, French movies used to be
awesome, wtth Alain Delon, Catherine Deneuve and other brilliant
actors. Ever since Hollywood claimed center stage, Paris has lacked its
former luster. But, you should give Sons re Seize a chancel

B: Um, Hollywood's heen krngsincc afterWorid Warl. Eversince,
l-‘rancc has been trying to compensate by making arty (read incompre.
hensihle) cinema. This little on orinoomprehensihiiity covers a womans
search for her missing husband on :l beach. All, it’s [int beach-search
movie that everyone's dreamt ofbut director Francois Ozon had the guts
to make. Bravo.

Rushmore (R)

B1 Max Fischer (Jason Schwatl‘Lman) is an overlyeinvolved, yet
academically—underachieving, scholarship—supported private school
student in love with a professor, He also wants to build an aquarium.
He's definitelysomeone Grinnellians can relate to. Bill Murray's in
Rut/711mm, too.

Cultural Film

The Wind

8: Much like Trafﬁc/Am a couple weeks ago, there’s really Five
different movies called 77:: Wine! I hope this is the olle about the

ancient wind that makes college kids go crazy. That’d play great at
Grinncll.

Yo La Tengo

The Aislers Set
Friday, Sept. 26, 8 p.m.
Ham’s Center

On Friday, Sept. 25, acclaimed indie band Va La Tengo
will be arriving in Grinnell with The Aislers Set for your
entertainment.

Tengo has recently returned to the U.S. train their
European tour, and are now traveling across the continent
to promote their latest album, Summer Sun from Matador
Records.

Yo La Tengo, which means ”I Have It" in Spanish, just
in case you were wondering, is a tub from Hohoken, N. J.
consisting of Ira kapian (vocals, guitar) Georgia Huhley
(vocals, drums) and James McNaw (bass, backing vocals).
Kaplan and Huhley suited the group as a married couple
to years ago and went through several hassisis before
settling on McNaw.

Their music is distinctly mellow and surreal, with
subdued vocals and quirky song titles like "The Love Life‘
oilhe Octopus.” The artists experiment wiih a variety oi
sounds, frequently playing instruments that they are
unmmiliar with. Unobtrlisive electronic sounds and subtle
vocal harmonies are thrown into the strange hill. enjoyable
mix, but the core of the music is in the echoing, distant
guitar melodies and undulating rhythms.

The overall result is an ambiance that lull: the listener
into a platid state of mind, a perfect way to unwind alter
three hours of homework. Yo La Tengo bears some
similarities to The Velvet Underground .or Sonic Youth, who
they cite as some of their major inﬂuences.

The Aislers Set, from the San Francisco Bay Area is the
opening act. The gmup was started by Amy Linton, a
former member of HenrYs Dress, Go‘sailor and The Softies.
Linton teamed up with Wyatt Cusitk (guitar), Alicia
Vandon Hueval (hass),Voshi Nakamoto (drums) and Jen
Cohen (keyboard) to create a light and breezy sound
reminiscent of 605 folk music. Their music revolves around
dreamy vocal harmonies and simple rhythms. The
arrangement is usually kept la-ﬁ, lending their recordings
a markedly hipp -like quality.

So far The Aislers Set only has three albums to their
name: Terrible Things Happen (1998). The LastMatth
(2000) and their recenily released How I learned in wine
Backwards (2003)
