Though Ftaiicis did not otret any

leased a ptlhlicxtatemeht that Plans had
”too many technical and administrative
problem: and limitations to continue in
IIS current form."

The ttsponse ttoin usets was rotce.

oiitii Plans was i-cinstatcd. By ptess time this week. the
petition had ovet 700 signatiitct.

On July 24, in yet aiiotliet memo posted on the

“it was actually a telativciy simple decision, Kenslet
said LCtrlng Plans die oitwas simply not an option and

said in an e mail interview

Actotdtng to Kenslet, the biggest change to Plans is
not technical. but legal and administrative. ”in the old
venue, on college computets... plans fell undet the Aca—
deinic Computet use Policy," he explained. ”Now that
iiitiis is no longet airiliated with the college, it tequites its

was still left [ti wonder why Plans had been shutdown so
suddenly and wiih so little watning.

“Letting plans die off
was simply not an op—
tion, and the terms of
the new policy were
simply unacceptable."
7Jonathan Kensler ’04

in a meeting in February, Bill Francis 7 in the tom—
pany or ienniret Krohn, dean tot student life 7 asked
Kenslet and stone to make substantial changes to Plans.
Ftaneis made thtee teoucsts: that pians be testticted to out.

side usets, that it be inaccessibie thiough intemet snatch
engines, and that selected pottioiis orthe Academic Com-
putet use Policy be posted on the
opening site.

Accotdiiig to Francis, these tee
quest: wete not met, and between
liebiuaty and the shutdown in July,
he sent them wete about ten com-

plaints about “eithet siandctous ot
thtcatening comments" posted on
Plans.

Ftaiicis cited these complaints,
combined win. the ratiute to com.
ply with the demands made in Feb»
tuaty as the teason tea the shutdown
in July. Thebteaicing point was that
I had seen «buss. .an esmlation ot continuation otptob.
lems that wete alteady theta, he said.

Some usets speculated that one fctmttraeulty membet's
aliegtdiylibelous postings had been involved, rotmet dance

Ahet being told that hot postings wete libelous, siie edited
hat plan and moved the sections cited as liabilities, The
next day, Plans was disabled. Betson

was not available rot comment.

Neithet antis not any othet start
membet has cited Betton-s posting as a
teason rot the shutdown.

At an August open rotum, rtesi.
dent Osgood brieﬂy mentioned that
some health inronnation had been
posted on Plans without that pctson's
consent: a violation ofrccentlyvpassed
redetai ptivaey laws.

Changes to the computing
policy

still othet questions teniain con.
oetningctinncil'sAcademicComputet
Use Policy (ACUP). which ITS
amended on July 21 without communicating with any
membets or the student Academic Computing Commitv
tee.

The new policy outlines a sttingent seties or tulcs rot
students running inttual communities on ooiiegesystems
The new node tequites maintainois to ensute compliance
with college policies tegatding accepted community stone
dards in addition to academic computer use." It also to»
quires a set standatd or due ptocest tot usets who violate
those policies and a nightiy iogging system that allows tot
the collection oFevidence in such cases.

It is my belief that
Grinnell College students
ahve the right to form
virtual communities, just
as they have the light to
form non—virtual ones."

7Prof. John Stone,

computer science

Ftaneis pointed out that plans' lack ofa logging system
wﬁ one otthe main teasons that Plans could not continue
in its outtent rotm. “People would make complaino and l
wouid have no way orinvestigating them," he said, “yout
evidence base was iust not out them"

The new policy has a rait shate otoutspoiten and in.
iiuentiai enties including John stone ptotcssotorcomputet
science, iotwhom Plans was otiginaiiy wtitten. stone has
been one of the most outspoken ethics or the tccent ad.
ministtative decisions and ACUP changes.

“it is my belief that ctinneii coiiegc students have
the tight to rotm virtual communities. just 3 they have
the tight to iotm non<vrrrual ones," ttoressot stone wtote
in an online posting, “students ate tot, in genetai, obli»
gated to help the college authotities enrotce coiiegc tuies,
and I see no gtounds rot the implicit ptemise that the use
otcomputet netwoth in (he totmation ota student com-
munity genetatc ot heightens such an obiimtion."

“ [The changes] diteaten Ill: coiiege's tmditionai com.
mitment to student seltegovetnanoa. shutting down the ntst
major experiment in building a studenenin oneline com.
munity and biodcing rutute attempts," stone said at an
open rotum on the changes August 29.

lTS’s alternative to Plans

As ptotnised in July, a new vittuai community became
available berotc tall semestet classes began. Pionectlog is
accessible thtottgh Blackbeatd and olrets an account to any
cuttent student, start ot raeuity. Alums cannot access
“PLog.”

"Functionally, [PLog] is similat
[to Piansi," said Francis, “administta-
tively is what is dinetent." Accotding
to anois PLog allows all membets
ot the onecampus community an ac-
count, and complies with the new
ACUP where Plans did not.

Thectinneil Online Community
Otganitation Advisory Committee is
a committee ctcated by Francis and
led by Deputy ITS Ditectot Mails
Millet and is chatgod with ptoviding
advice on the fututo otvittuai oom-
munitiesfl'h: committee has two our
tent studeno sitting. The gtoup will
ptovide advice to imptove and publl»
ciao PLog.

mantis is optimistic about the {stone ofPLog. “i think
it will build up an audience," he said

Case is one of die few students to log into PLog since
its inception. “1 logged in and basically evetything I saw
said 'go use Plans," he said, “it's not going to be very suc-
cssful."

“Plans will likely remain the unofﬁcial [virtual com-
munity] otctinneii because it has so many loyal and ac.
tive usets, stone said in a scpzmrc intetview, it is unrot.
tunate it cant have ofﬁcial Sums
