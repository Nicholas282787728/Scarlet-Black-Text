FTP wants wind turbine at CERA

Free use Planet (FTP) and Facilities Management (FM) held a
meeting with the administration this week to urge the college to
agree to build awind turbine at the Conard Environmental Research
Area.

“As a liberal arts institution, this college must invest in sources of
renewable energy," said Zeke Hausfasher '05 of FTP. both FTP and
FM want the touege to build a 750 kilowatt wind turbine at CERA
to supply about ten percent or the college's electricity need. lfthat
fails, the groups hope for a loo kilowatt nirbine to meet the power
needs ofCERA

“FM has been pursuing a wind generator installation idea for
several years now, predominantly a 750 ldlomtt utility generator lo-
and at CERA,” said RickWhitncy. ossociote director of FM.

However, the final decision to install either of the turbines is not
in the college's hands. It's up to local power utility, Alliant Energy.
“Putting a 750 kilowatt generator out at CERA , . would not make
any sense unless Alliant permits us so use remote metering. Alliant
has already said “no" but I recently wrote them a lesser asking Alliant
to reconsider in position end also asking them to exphm the rosin.

tioml and budget planning.

I-TP and PM are holding out hope for the wind turbine. “At the
meeting we had with l=M end Osgood, the president reacted rovor.
ably to the ideo orthe college building a wind turbine, Housfother
said. He has not committed to any particular project yet, but we are
pretty confident that the administration and the board of trustees
will accept our project

“We are hopeful that a wind turbine installation could happen
roughly in conjunction with the new CERA facility’s construction,
slated for 20042005," added Whitney.

Getting ripped off"

by David Archer

A: tcxtbook prices continue to rise faster than inﬂation, students
are finding new ways to keep from going broke. Many have started
searching for used books on the internet and some have even begun
to look overseas to ﬁnd the lowest priccs. And although the faculty
and administration find themselves handcuffed by the powerful book
publishing industry, they are aware orthe problem and some profcs.
sors are taking measures to rcdu'ce the costs for studenu.

Book publishers and sellers were recently thrust' into the focus of
higher education when an article in the New York Timer (Oct. 21)
highlighted how publishers set dirferent prices for the same book in
different countries. Publishers defend the practice as normal in busie
nos: and legal, but the National Association ofCollcgc Stores (NASC)
is now calling for the industry so standardise book prices across bore
ders.

Book publishers have used price discrimination for years, bus, as
the article illustrated, only since the advent ofthc internet have stu-
dcnts been able to exploit the price differences. chxltﬁ that re-
import books have recently cropped up, catering to thriftyAmerican
students, but publishers have already saken measures so keep the
markets separate. bookcensraleom said that as a result ofthe article
in the Timer, a number ofpublishcrs are “preventing us from ortesirig
steep discounts so students on many popular titles."

international dirrerenees in prices are drastic for textbooks in par.
ticular, frequently leaving studeno in the sci»
enees with the highest book costs.

example, Costs $134.90 new on Amazoncom’s
American site, but only 345.6 for the same edi-
tion on its British site'. principles efEconrmits
by N, Gregory Mankiw costs $118.95 at
Amazontom‘s American site, though the same
edition costs only $52 on its British site.

Some international students already know
about them differences and buy books in their
home country when possible. Saurabh Smf’OS
said he buys his math and economics textbooks
in his home country, India, where he says they
cost about 90 percent less than they do in the
us. “The only difference is shot they were put
perbacks and had no color," scrofsoid, "something l've been used so
since day one, since lndian textbooks never use color for ﬁnancial
reasons."

Eric Wu '05, aTaiwanese student from Bangkok, bought Biology
(oth ed.) by Campbell and Reese for l MOThai blur in Bangkok, or
$27.14, whilc the same book cost: $121 new in the US. He said he
also bought Organic Ckemiscry by Jones for $43.13 in Taiwan.

“lfI an, i will definitely buy my textbooks overseas." said Wu.

The college's bookstore does purchase books from foreign mas.
kets but only to ﬁnd titles that are unavailable in the U.S.. and never
solely to bargain hunt. They ovoid buying books from overseas bc-
Gus: delivery costs tend to be higher and returning books is usually
prohibited onto the store has tried to resell them, said ]. Harley
Mcllmth, assistant manager and tcxt and tndebook buyer at the book-
store. Domestic sellers, on the other hand, allow booksellers to me
turn unsold books for little or no diasge, except shipping costs.

To lower costs for students, the bookstore marks up books less
than most college bookstores, charging 25 percent more for used
books and 20 percent more for new textbooks _ die national aver,
age is 22.4 percent,

“It’s not run like a business. It's run really as a service," said John
Kalkbtcnncr, vice president for college services. And unlike other
bookstores, tho college's does not turn a profit, though it is expected
to cover in own costs. “It’s kind of a break-even," said Kalkbronner.
"Usually we're a little bit behind every year"

However, although the rnsernct has made foreign markets acccst
sible to Americans, all textbooks cannot be purchased from overseas.
Bookstore managers J. Harley Mctlrath and Cassie Wherry suspect
publishers will find ways to erect barriers to foreign markers before
they yield to demands for standardized, or reduced, prices.

so in the longeterm, high book prices will likely join the mp and
gown as pillars of higher education in American.

However, faculty and administrators, restricted as they may be,
are finding ways so mitigate the high costs.

“This is not an issue that the science Division has addressed col.
lectively, but is certainly is an issue that most if nos all faculty mem-
bers in the division are quite aware of," said Mark Schneider, physics
professor and science division chair.

The college's commitment to academic freedom is one of the
primary serous the administration cannot enact institution-wide
policies on book buying. Ultimately, professors withhold the right to
choose which books they want their students to study, regardless of
price, explaining why costs can skyrocket, said Mark Montgomery,
economics professor and chair of faculty.

“Grinncll college is too small and too respectful offaculty pre.
rogatives to have any collective impact on the behemoth known as
she textbook publishing industry, said Victoria Brown history pro»
fosor and social science division chair.

A: much as textbooks cost. rhey account for only a small fraction
ofth: comprehensive fees by one etimare, Grinnell snidents spend
$750 on books per year 7 and most professors are unwilling to
sacriﬁce quality to cut oosis.

“The quality ofinstruction often depends heavily on the cluality
ofshc textbook. so most faculty are reluctant to choose asignihcandy

poorer quality text so save a few dollars,"
Schneider said.

some professors have taken the initiative
to lower costs for students by reducing the
number of books required and by using the
library and electronic reserves foreouise docu.
ments.

”Personally. I do factor into my required
book choices their collective cost, and i would
guess that many colleagues do as well," said
Jack verses, music professor and humanities
division chair. “I make every attempt to keep
she total book costs for my courses under
3100."

Montgomery said he rarely uses more than
one book and has increasingly used electronic
reserves out or concern for high costs.

Professors have also begun to use course packets as a way to can»
solidase myriad readings and reduce costs. Brown said professors have
”discusscd at great length" course packets, copyright permission fees
and articles on blzeserve on behalf ofssudenss.

“1n sharinsiance, there has been tremendous faculty concern about
students costs and, i think, real oltoro made to reduce these costs,"
brown said.

verses and other professors also heouenrly plaoc expensive text»
books on reserve as the library for the semester,

“I will sometimes decide not to require a book (often a hardback
not available in paperback) for a course because of its expense, and
instead negotiate with the library the purchase ofthree or four copies
ofthc book so be placed on reserve," said verses.

sometimes book prices are so high snidenss end up not buying
required texts or order books on the internet and fall behind as they
wait for them to arrive.

“This cessainly continues to be problematic for a few snidents,
who may delay getting a book, or attempt to get by through sharing
or borrowing a book, or who end up selling a book at the end ofshe
semester that might serve as a valuable resource for more advanced
courses," Schneider said.

Montgomery also said he hm taught students who did not have
enough money to buy all the required books.

The Ofﬁce of Financial Aid does consider book costs when rel.
culating awards for students. However, [he oltrtc does "not adjust
the booklinc-item in our financial aidbudgcs rotstudcnrs each year,"
said Jim sumnes, director ofAdmisiions and Financial Aid. “And, in
fact, we have been talking about the possibility that is may be too low
at the moment."
