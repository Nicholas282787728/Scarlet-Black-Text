“Bubble”
misconception

While I also find rhe increased police presence on campus and
24.hour lockdown ro he excessive. I would like so respond io Norman
Perlmurrer's commenrs ahour sexual assauli (random ianr, 10/10).
Norman inenrions ihar “yes, ihere were some sexual assaulis. Bur
rhey were off-campus, We don't even know rhe derarls, hur, ar any
rare, ihey weren’r rapes." Firsr ofall, wherher rhe assaulrs occured off
campus or onemmpus is irrelcvene srudenis spend rime offcampus,
and sexual predarors can enrer ihe “bubble” of crrnnell College. 1
ihink a common misconceprion ahour ihis mmpus is “bad srufr"
can'r inrrude onro college properry, which chvrously is nor rrue. Seer
ond, saying rhar ihe evenrs are less signrficanr hecaiee ihey weren'r

ro arraek and grope someone, just as long as it’s nor rape? i don’t
