On March 119, 1794, Eli Whitney patented the cotton girl. A

Massachusetts native and would-be lawyer living in Georgia,

Whitney was struggling to pay off debts accrued while studying at Vale

when he came upon the idea of making some money off the patent Actai1793. his

invention revolutionized cotton production (and institutionalized slave labor), but his

demand that farmers turn over twoeﬁfths of their profit for the use of a girl led to

widespread circumvention of the patent. Miied in lawsuits, Whitney failed to draw
substantial royalties from the gin for another ten years.

from 1942 to 1979, all royalties from sales ofMein Kampfwele channeled through the
U.S. government into the repatn'ation of World Waillvittims.1n 1979, the government
offered to sell the rights back to the original American publisher, lloughton Mifflin-
for 537,254, the book's esomated future sales. between 1979 and 2000, the company
made $400,000 on Adolph hitlers opus, until a sen'es of articles in U.S. News and
World Report persuaded the company to donate those proﬁtsiand any others, in

Gerald Ford is the last living member or the Warren commission, the committee

Kennedy died the honest of any u.s. president up to that time, with a fortune of no

Total solar eclipses wouldn't happen ifthe ratio between the moon's and sun's diameters

if the moon were a little smaller, or a little closer, it couldn't cover the entire sun.

Astronomers once speculated that the thin ring of debris around Jupiter might have
been formed by a moon that swerved too close to the gas giantand collapsed underits
gram‘ty. NASA’S 199a Galileo probe, however, revealed five separate rings, most likely
made of dust blasted off Jupiters moons by meteoroids.

According to Admiral Ackhar, the climax of The Return of the Jedi takes plate on and
around ”the forest moon of Endor.” In that movie, Endul is a gas giant orbited by a
forested moon. in 1984’s The fwok Adventure and 1985’s Ewaks: The settle for Endar,
however, Endof seems to he the name ofthe forest moon itself.

Technological upgrades to Reagan's star Wars program required it to negotiate with a
long succession of different defense contrattors. in order to keep its eouipment
standardized (so parts could be replaced by different tontractors) a common descnptive
language was developed. The result, VHDL, is one of the two most common hardware
descriptive languages in use today.

tontrary to American myth, Eli whitney never developed a working system of
interchangeable parts. (he did sell 4,000 muskets to the Us. military, but his
demonstration of assemblysllne production was a hoaxihe’d handcrafted them each,
then disassembled them.) The actual inventors were french gunsmiths in the 17205.
Napoleon, however, forbade mass production in 130a, because it undercut the power
of governmentecontmlled trade guilds. Half a century later, french military officers
were shotked to see the method in use in the u.s.—they'd never heard of it.

Creating an image
of success

when l was four years old my grandma decided it
was about time that my brother, sister, and I learned
how to play bridge. Our grasp of the game was very
limited at the time and mostly involved playing only
those cards that we deemed the least aesthetically pleas.
ing; the others we wanted to keep, This, of course,
aggravated my grandmother who was quire certain
that without the grasp ofsuch a simple game
as bridge we would never fall into success/9d
company.

“Denny, why in God’s name did you
play r/rnt card’" she would mutter.

[would drool in reply.

“You know, when your grandfa—

gotta regularly with somt of the
most important people in the
city. Do you think playing like

I would pick my nose and fret
about the thought ofroiccrion by the social elite,

“Well, I think not. And stop picking your nose.
You're being disgusting. "

lswitchcd to the other nostril, continuing to fret.

Interactions like these were common when
grandma came to visit. She would stay with us for
three or four weeks each winter, determined to use
that time to criticize every aspect ofmy mother's be.
ing and, hopefully to instill in its children an appre.
ciation for the graces and habits ofthe civilized class.
She came into town like a winter storm of pink cash.
mere, tasteful jewelry, and frigid
classism; just the thing to liven up
the holiday season.

one of her favorite instruc.
tional tales was that of my
grandfather's death.

“Have I ever told you how
your grandpa died?” she would
occasionally ask us, with a glint
orpride on her face.

This was our one to gather
around the old woman and learn
from hot ngcd wisdom. We would
meander over to wherever she was
sitting and plant oursclvcs close
enough to hang on her every
word, but far enough away that we would not risk
physical contact. Shewas adlgniﬁed woman—not the
type to express Eimilial affectioniand practical, too,
realizing that young children were like mud or moist
dog poop and could easily ruin onc’s clothing.

“Well, it was the spring of 1954 and your grand.
father and I were going to fly down to California for
the weekend with a couple ofgood friends." She was,

This thought gives inc great
