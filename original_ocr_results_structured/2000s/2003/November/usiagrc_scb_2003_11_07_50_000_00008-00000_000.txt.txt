9. Fill your bathtub with hot chocolate spiked with
peppermint schnapps and have the party, or bathing
experience, or your life,
at Wear a ski mask. Just make sure you're not also carrying
a baseball bat, because that would look suspicious.
7. Flood Mat Field, wait for it to freeze and have naked
skating day, Anything is lun when you’re naked and outside.
6. According to all old hiddy '04-er, knii. a scari while
watching ”WI-reel of rortune” Tuesdays at 6 pm. It will
give you something to do and keep you warm later on.
5, Move into Burling 4th. rhey won’t notice a sleeping beg,
you can shower in Fine Arts, and it’s closer to class than
your dorm.
4r Spend your time trying to get some, just please keep it
inside.
3. Watch old reruns of MTV spring break-«not that anyone
