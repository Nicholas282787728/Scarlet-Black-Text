stocit facilities tarot the farmers. they say, and they
want more control at the county level over who
can build what sort oflivcstoek operations in their
backyards.

The issue came to a vote on Sept. 18 when the
three-member Poweshiek County Board OFSHPEF
visors rejected; moratorium thatwotild have halted

voted for it.

The moratorium was designed to give the
County Board ochalth time to collect data about
how CAFOs affect public health before any more
permanent measures were taken.
