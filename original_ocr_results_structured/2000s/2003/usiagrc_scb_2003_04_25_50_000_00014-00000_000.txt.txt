By myendorsemenrorinrormed use, i by no means inrend ro

wisdom may only be round in one's own mind; ifon: inrends ro

will be profoundly disappoinring. However, such marerials drae

In short, by hosting Alice
1 hope to some small
degree to legitimize the

Why you should
come and ﬁght

on May 3rd rhcre will be perhaps 100 or more people cure
side ofLoose having a barbecue, gerring rheir races paiiired, hire
ring each orher wirh roam swords, and generally just having a
good riine.

You should be among rhem.

There are a lor ofrnyrhs and srereorypes abour bag on rhis
campus, some well-founded and orhers ,usr plain wrong. All or
rhem needlessly discourage people from coming our and ﬁnding
our for rhemselves whar Dag is all abour. I pcrsonally didn't do
Dag unril rhe end oriny sophomore year because oronc orrhese,
and now ihar I'm graduaring i sure wish I’d had rhose rwo more
years orrun. so look ir over and come our licxr sniiirday and ﬁnd
our iusr how much run roam swords can be.

Myth: Dag is comperirive.

Face Though you are always ﬁghring againsr someone else,
everyone is very laid back abour Dag, and mosr people only com.
pare wirh rhemselves, ro do berrer rhan rhey’ve done before.
Everyonc's happy so see someone have a good day, and no one
ever says “ha, I gor your"

Myrh~ lr won’r be any fun because 1 don’r know whar I’m do-
ing, so I suck.

Fact: Everybody sucks ro srarr wirh some people (myself, for
example) srill suck a long rime laser. But even when you barely
have a clue whar's going on you’re and useful ro your reammares,
and you can seill have a
lor oirun. What’s more.
we always have plcnry or
people ar all skill levels.
so rhere'll always be
someone your level so
spar wirh, and we have
rraining sessions regu.
larly rliaryou can arrcnd
if you're really worried
abour ir. Field day is a
grcar rinse in srarrl

Myrl-i: bag is vioe
lcnr/Dag hurrs/l have so liurr people io righr in bag,

Fact: We're big pansies. We spend a loi of time and alien
making sure rhar all ofoiir weapons and equipmenr are safe and
rhar everyone knows whar rliey‘re doing. Heck. we’ve even gor ar
leasr rwo Quakers who ﬁghr regularly myselrincluded,

Myrh: bag is ﬁlled wirh freaks/geeks/aiirliro majors,

Fact: Alright, rhar ones rriie. Bur us also full of nerds/dorks/
cs majors! l-loiiesrly, Dag isn’r roo much frcnkler rhan any oiher
random segmcnr orciinnellians. The {nor is, bag is iusr a laid,
back, bur run and exeiriiig, way ro spend a nice aﬁernoon, and us
full orgrcar people. come meer as, men decide whar you rhink.

Dagorhir has been one of my besr experience: here as Grin-
nell, and I wanr to do whar r can re make sure rliar orher people
don’t make rhe same misrake i did for lack of knowledge. Field
Day will be a blase; food, music, race painring, Dunk—rheslownie
(we love our rownies), and nilry demonsrrarioiis will abound. as
well as more ﬁghring man you can shake a glaive ar. come and

There are a lot of myths
and stereotypes about
Dag on this campus, some
wellsfounded and others
just plain wrong.

Basic rules you should know about

Alright, this isn’t even to the level of self-gover-
nance. This is basic human society rules here Don’t
use in public. Don’t pee in a place where people are
eating. Don’t pee into a cup that lots of people (would)
use to drink out of. Don't pee in a cup and then send it
on to let someone else clean it up

Maybe Ijust had to be there to see the humor in
the situation... or maybe it’sjust foul. In any case, I’m
glad I eat in Cowles.

A fun game to play at Ham's

Hey you! Yeah, you Do me a favor. Next time you
go into the Harris Center, just stop for a minute in
the vestibule and take a look around. Even better,
bake this newspaper with you and go right now I’ll
wait Now that you're in the right pbce, what do you
see? Four walLs, a ﬂoor, and a ceiling? What does this
tell you? By any reasonable standards, this would imply
that you are inside. You came in through the doorto
get here, didn't you? So, ifyou’re inside the building,
and it’s a non-smoking building, that means you
should“. what? Not smoke, you say? That’s right! It
was a tough question, but you figured it out You’re
so clever. Do everyone a favor. Don’t smoke in the
vestibules of the Han-is Center or any of the other
buildings. If you want to partake in a disgusting habit,
ﬁne, that’s your problem. Just don’t make it my prob
lem, just to get into a public building. Too cold out-
side? Put on a jacket —Mark French :03

Taking candy from a stranger

Thank you, Grinnell students for being completely
trustworthy This morning [went to James pit kitchen
to cook myself some lunch, and found sitting on the
table a box of cookies with a sign on them saying,
“Please help yourself.” They looked quite delicious,
so I helped myself to one, as it suggested Later, I
thought of the old words of wisdom, “Never take candy
from a stranger," and thought back to my cookie. Its
really a wonderful thing that 1 can ﬁnd random food
offered namelessly to me in a kitchen, and feel per-
fectly comfortable taking it. So thanks again, for be-
ing honest and worthy of my trust, and thank you for
the cookie.
