Writing on

The Burling bathroom walls remain a forum for
self—expression while changing with the times

by Sara Millhouse

For as long as Biirling mﬁ‘ members can remember, the walls orrho
library bnrhroorns haw been covered with sriioenr gramrl ranging From
polirieal statements to sexual innuendos to offensive remarks. Notably,
riie basement woman's room has become a place of“afﬁrmation" through
artwork, quotations and student poerry. The bathrooms have even been a
stop on college rours, slid Rebecca Stuhr, Collection Development and
Preservation Librarian.

“People really do come ro Grinncll based on what is wrirren in rhere
srslls; people really are inspired," roads one piece ntbarh room wisdom, “It
does matter. 50 write, draw, imagine "

Faerhries Management (FM) rcpzulils rhe Burllng bathrooms reini—
annually, over winrer and surnrner breaks. Semirnnnual repniirring has
been rhe policy Since rho bathroom walls beearne a publicly accepred foA
rum for expression. PM may also pninr over grnmri in which “iridcpcne
dent people are targeted in inappropriate ways," said Jen Krohn, Dean for
Student Life,

The women's bathroom hosts lists ofcool women and hot seniors, as
well as guorarioirs ranging from DarWIlliamS and Car Stevens ro Emily
Dickinson and Lord Byron. There are also comments on the costs ofwar,
Grinncll lite and relarionships, “In a lot ofways, it's been eorrsisrenr in
being Focused on solﬂirnage, on feiniirisr and gayrlcsblan istues," said Sriihr.

Over rhe years, however, bathroom grafﬁti in Burling has grown miicli
less oeeiisive, reﬂecting changing values nationally and in Grlnricll, as
wall as rho acceptability ottxpressing certain sentiments publicly.

In 1986, Grinnell rrurlenr Sarah ciofr dld :m errenslyr paper about
graffiti in which she copied examples from the bathroom walls. Corn»
merits included racist and homophobic SmICmcnlS from both the women's
and man's bathrooms

However, Croft found a large difference between the grafﬁti in the
two bathrooms. [n rhe women's bathrooms, "the ropies are very personal,
sex, sexuality, selr , ,, personal relationships. The rnen's . ,. toplcs receiving
the most attention at: racism, Power, politicsinauonal and international
and Grinnell student government," she wrote.

In 1993, grafﬁti topics were much the same. “The women‘s bathroom
gramn may be described as ‘suppottive’ and ‘almost like a sacred place:
while men's bathroom grafﬁti seems to be more of‘rn ourler for things
that aren’t PC at Grinncll,” wrote thenrstudcnt Nate Lange in [he April
16, 1993 issue of the Scarlet and Bbub

begin again,

“Ir‘s about arr in public places. and you can sue how people progress in
rheir thinking," said Stulir. “Sometimes when people ﬁrst come here, rhey
have a more black and whire view, and they develop a more tumplex view
You can ,udge a persons progress."
