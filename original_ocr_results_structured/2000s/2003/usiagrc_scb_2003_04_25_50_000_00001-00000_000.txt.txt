Former Grinnellian supports nonviolent
Palestinian resistance in the Gaza Strip

by Michael Andersen

IAum Kraﬁowin doesn’t think she’s coming back to Grinnell.

She left last May, at the end or her sophomore year, when a disagree.
merit with her parcirrs led them to our orrher retest to money designated
for her education

“Unlike many Grinnelllans, I have no desire to be severely in debt at
the age of 21 she said.

so. after traveling across the eountry during the trimmer and spend-
ing four months in her native Pittsburghiqbeing depressed with my de-
pressed friends who don’t want to be in Pittsburgh," she said—she ene
rolled in a program promoting Allyn/t. the temporary or permanent in-i-
migration oriews to Israel.

The people who run the program, she said, probably did not have the
same plans for her time in Israel that she did. After aeeepting their trnvel
money and taking a two-week course from the program, Kraftowitz be-
gan work at what she called a ”JewishrAnb cultural exchange center" in
Haifa. in northern Israel.

After sevenl months there, Krartowrrc took a three-day vaeation to
visit a friend In Rafall, a Palestinian refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. 'I‘llere
she met a handful ofynung members ofthe International Solidarity Move-
ment (ISM), :i Pnldsilmanded organization that brings volunteers from
around the world to support nonviolent resistanee against lsiael's occupa-
tion of Palestine.

Aweek InECl’, on March 16, her friend called her at work. Rachel Conic,
one oftheAmericans she had met in Rafa, had been killed an hour before,
The Evergreen state College student had been standing in front ora Pal-
estinian house that was slated for demolition by the Israeli Defense Force
(IDF). According to witnesses, a military bulldozer slowly advanced on
her until her body was dragged beneath its blade, then dragged the blade
back over her body, mangling it,

Corrie was the first Amerimn killed by Israeli fares during the cur»
rent uprising in Palestine. A subsequent investigation by the IDF con.
cluded that its members had been blameless in her death. ISM actrvists
said there was no way the driver could have missed Corrie. who was stand-
ing at the driver’s eye level and wearing a bright
orange vest,

Kraftowiu immediately left her job and went
to Rafah to see her friend. A month Inter she win
still there, visiting hospitals with Carrie’s former
companions and using the ﬁrst person plural,

“We’ve been working on a lot of community
work, like talking with students and teachers and
getting students to meet with internationals,“ she
said in a telephone interview after a day visiting
the family ofTom HutdaJIi a British ISM activist
who was shot in the head two weeks ago while
trying to help a Palestinian woman and her child
escape lsraeli gunfire. Hurdall is now brain-dead
and lying in an Israeli hospital, “Right now every.
thing is shot [0 hell, basiully."

Besides Hurdall and Corrie, an ISM-affiliated Arnenran named Bl ian
Avery was shot by the IDF last month in lenin. He is also in a hospital.

“Everyone's reevaluating," said Kraftowirz. “We're not effective as hu-
mair shields lfthey’rt: going to shoot us as they do Palestinians,“

Because Gaza is not technically occupied, residents of Rafah seldom
see IDF soldiers in person. The army, however, has retently been focusing
on widening the no-man’s-land between the edge of houses in Rafah and
the lZ»meter wall that lsrael has erected near the refugees’ camp.

“Israelis, to [Palestinians], are machines," said Kraftowitz, “Big tanks."

"Kids are running around,
too many of them with
bullet holes somewhere.
Too many of them that have
seen their friends shot,
their parents shot.”

The proeess involves unexpected requests rot Palestinians to Vamte
their homes. and. frequently, violence. Accompanying the desiruetion since
the beginning orthe current palestinian uprising, have been eeonomirslly
erippling restrictions on Palestinians ability to travel anywhere.

“There's not a lot orrvork," said Kraftowiiz,
“so they reel bored and they feel helpless and they
feel depressed, Kids are nrnningaround. too many
or them with bullet holes somewhere Too many
or them that have seen their friends shot, their
parents shot.”

Living in Rafah

Krairowirc isn’t sure how long she'll stay with
the ISM in Rafah, and it's hard for her [0 easily
summarize exactly what has kept her there.

“Everyone's reasons change as we learn more,"
she said.

“One ortlre huge reasons I‘m here is bcuuse
I'm Jewish," she eonrrnued. after a pause, “It’s my
obligation to say no, this can't be done in my name. If Jews in Europe
had had more people hiding them, more people speaking out, anyone
speaking out, [the Holocaust] wouldn't have happened "

Israelis don't rend to see her work in rhe same light.

“The individual conversations, l'vo had a million times," she said, “They
go Exactly the same way."

Lately, she has merely told lsraelrs that she volunteers with children.
It’s a necestary concession, she said, to n society that she thinks would
beneﬁt from her experiences lfll eould accept them,

Alcohol-related
hospital visits
up this year

Some say higher numbers reﬂect
increased reliance on RLCS

it was the night orDiseo and Maya~ was with some
friends, getting ready for the dance and drinking vodka,
“Getting mught up in the moment, Iwasn’t paying a lot of
anenrion to how much I’d had to drink,” said Maya.

She got to Harris, where Disco was being held, and
soon realized she had had too many shots. “I was very
drunk, she recalled. "After a while, I went to the baLhmom,
and vomited."

security and an RLC. SoonMaya was in the hospital,

“The RLC, who knew about a mediation l was tak—
ing, was very eoneemed. and made the decision that i
should go to the hospital," said Maya, whose blood alco-
hol level was .146 that night, which equates to about four

lzed beeauso or drinking too much this year, This figure
represents an inorease from the six hospitalizations reported
lass year. but it remains below the 21 experienced in ‘00-
01.

According to figures compiled by Jen Krohn, dean rot
student life. student emits has seen an overall rise in the
number of alcohol and drug related incidents involving
students this academic you

There have been nine arrests for alcohol related inei.
dents, up from one last year. But the tour alcohol-related
iarlings mark a decrease from seven a year ago.

Although these numbers are not as high as they have
been in the past, some administrators still worry about
drinking on eampust “were obviously really concerned
about the aleohol problem," said Tom Ciady, vice presi-
dent ofstudent dam.

The college plans to focus on alcohol education pro-
grams during New student Orientation next fall, and in a
more direct way than in previous years. Liz Allan '04,
sea presidenteleet for 2003—04, said she plans for SGA
to eonduet more selftgovernance education programs dur-
ing Nso next year as well.

“I would like to see self-governance awareness prompted
by students not administrators," Allen said. “it's about
people learning the philosophy orselegovernanee."

“We've never done a studenteentered education prev
gram, which all ties baek into [how] we envision Selftgov-
ernanee," said Allan.

some administrators say the rise in hospitaliutions
might rerleet that students simply know how to use the
available support tcsourccs better than they have in the
past.

“it is possible that students are seeking out RLCs more
this year than in past ymrs," crady said. Aeeotding to crady.
some rind this years RLCs are ”more approachable."

Mayz’s experience demonstrates the procedure tharstu.
dent affairs would like to sce members ofthe eommunity
follow when handling excessively drunk students.

While Steve Larson, director oiresidenrial life, said diet
he is always concerned about students drinking too much,
he also emphasized that tlreavtilable support system works.
“I don't see these numbers and go, ‘we have to get tougher,"-
he said. instead, he believes that students simply know how
to use the SAS, RLCs and security to get help when some-
one has been drinking too mueh,

The eollcge doesn’t neoessariiy have more problcms;
there might rust be more people getting help in ways that
are reported to student straits. sartl Larson.
