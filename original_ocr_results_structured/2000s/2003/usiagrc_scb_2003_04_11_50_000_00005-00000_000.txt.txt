A monthsold problem with the library's

Ar rhe same rims. during rinals week,
Librarian of rhe college Chrrsropher

she brink of bankruprcy.

Faxon had already billed its customers.
including Grinnell, for she year 2003. But

lixllcrs around the country decided to halt
sending magarincs and iournals ro any h»
biary nztlonwid: rhar subscribed to Faxon
unril rhey received rheir paymonr.

So despite the $200,000 to $300,000
rubscriprioii fee Grinnell paid to Faxon for
rhis year, she library sropped receiving
roughly 100 magazines and Journals.

“The bcaury of rho deal." said McKee,
“is rhar libraries aren'r going ro lose any.
