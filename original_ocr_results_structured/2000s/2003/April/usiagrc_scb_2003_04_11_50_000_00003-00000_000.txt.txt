Students, colleagues and family ﬁnd art, home and challenge in the life of John Mohan

John Mohan learned about classical music from his Esther. lama Mohan
was a coal miner inAshland. Pa., before the andincite market collapsed in
the wake ofthe Second World War. He was also a pianist, who would play
for his family in the evenings.

John, born in 1936, never had a knack ofhis own for the piano, but
he eontinued listening to other people’s music as he went to college and
became an English teacher at a public high school in Baltimore. After
learning Russian during a stint in the us, Army, he began to teaeh in that
subyect as well, and In 1973 he found a Job in the two-peison Russian

department ofcnnnell College.
for the next 29 years he taught a seminar on Tolstoy in the fall and
on Dostoevsky in the spring. Everyone remembers the last day of

Dostoevsky each year.

As accompaniment to Dostoevsky's deeply optimistic epilogue to
his final masterpiooe The Erin/7”; (armour, Mohan would play the
fourth movement of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, the “Ode to Joy."

“He puts on the tape in silence, and the class sits corn-

pletelystill,” said Jamie Bourdon '03, who was in the course
last spring. “Save their tears."

W'licii he learned that the Grinncll Community

Chorus was performing the Ninth Symphony at the

end ofthis semester, Mohan showed up unexpectedly

at rehearsal,
“I hadn’t known of his interest in Beethoven’s ninth,
but he said he'd wanted to do it his whole life,” said

John Rummeteim, Music, who directs the chorus. “I

don‘t think he‘d done a lot ofsinging in his life.”

"He had one note and he stuck

to it," said Alidmw Grecnlce ‘04, who

stood beside Mohan in the chorus.

“But he was probably the most enthu-
siastic person there}:

Living
Mohan was the first ofhis family to graduate from col»
lege, from Mount st. Mary's in Maryland in 1953, After two
years teaehing English, Mohan worried that he might be
drafted into military service, so he volunteered for a
noncombativc position, Though he'd never had great proﬁ—
ciency at foreign languages, he learned Russian in a year at the
Army's Defense language Institute and was sent to Turkey for
two years to listen to radio waves from across the Black Sea.
“He was a language speeialist," recalled hls wife Joan. “le.

work on his doctorate.
ltwas a turbulent time at universities everywhere, with black
students wielding rifles on the COVErOthu/Iwnk and FBI visits
to the doors of Russmn scholars Mohan apparently got his
name on ri list by receiving grants to study at Moscow state
University in 1969 and 1971—72 (the second time as a
Fulbright scholar).

friend named Sheila MaGlltlly hadjust been accepted to fill one of

John arrived in Beth Holmgren “7on sophomore year, The man whose
position he filled had been widely loved, she remembered. “I was a little
skeptical because I figured, ‘Who’s going to be able to top this guy." And
John was great. He took a subJeer very seriously, but he did not take him-
selfseriously. There was sort ofa twinkle in his eye, and he had a way of
advancing the discussion, and we didn’t know what hit us until it was too
late."

Holmgten, who said Mohan inspired her to enter teaching and who is
now the chair ofthe Russian department at the university ofNorth caro-
llnaeChapel Hill, said he was always more spiritual counselor than aca-
demic mentor.

“we used to joke about how he should have been a priest," she said.
“But he mlly enjoyed being married and doing all the things diat priests
should not be doing." .

The Mohans' two sons, John Paul and Joseph, were born in the years
that followed. Though Joan said her husband was a devoted father, he was
committed to his work at the oollege, teaching students, researching, and
tracking down faculty for a growing department.

“He was gone a lot,” she said. “I remember once being near tars—rt
was February registration, and I was standing there at die back stairs with
the baby on my hip I said, ‘Wcll, I'll see you in May: He said ‘Dcclare

“He was much more into reading books. discussing them with “W
dents, talking to oolleagues. discussing literature or tmching language,”

saidAnatoly Vishevsky the current department chair
and a 1994 recruit ofMohan's. “He did not like pa.
perwork."

“He was extremely democratic in the way he ran
the department," said Todd Armstrong, Russian.
“Though he had his own way there was never a
sense that he was in charge."

“He never had much tolerance for power struc.
tures at all, actually," hunted Kelly Herold, who, with
Armstrong and Raquel Greene, makes up the rest of
the four-member department. All were hired by
Mohan.

This was to be Mohan’s last semester as a full-time raeulty member,
though he planned to continue taaehing his popular literature seminars
during retirement. Colleagues said he was looking forward to the freedom
to focus on classes.

classes, of course, were enough work in themselvd. “He was just
shocked at how much preparing he had to do." Joan said. “Every Sunday,
Tuesday, Thursday night I'd know the ﬁrst thing he’d do when he came
home. Had go sit upstairs and hed prepare."

strong lectures and discussions, however, bred strong and lasting relae
tionships with students in a field that, at many us. colleges, struggled to
attract students after the end of the Cold War.

“He would go to a conference and by the way tell us that he was going
to meet with several alums from different years and they all knew that he
was coming and they would be very happy to see him," said Vishevsky, “i
think it is due to his vision that the department is so popular with stu
dents. we have basiaily. to the best of our abilities, eontnbuted to this
vlslons”

“He was Just a real programbuilder in a way that 1 don’t see the like of
in the rest of the field," said Holmgren, who saw Mohan regularly at Rus-
sian literature eonferenres.

“John was part of the reason Grinnsli reached the level that it did in
the early 805, or whenever it beams one ofth: top 20 or whatever,“ said
Armstrong, “And he often would say that rather than always striving to
emulate our peers or to see what other people are doing, let's not forget
what we did to get here paying attention to detail, caring about sm-
dents."

“He’s the most incredible professor l've ever had," said corinneweible
'03.

Teaching

“it's impossible to differentiate between John Mohan as a professor
and John Mohan as a human being," said Rosen, “because I feel like zny
interaction that I had with him, whether it be social or amdemic. I learned
something and l gained from it."

“He helped me a lot freshman year," said Angela sparks '04, whose
first elm session at Grinnell was Mohan’s tutorial Can Emmy Say: the
War“? “1 deﬁnitely kind offclt like he took me under his wing."

“He had so many wings, though," said Elizabeth Clark ‘045, another
member of the class. “He never tan out. "

Mohan shared the joys in his life wid-i diose around him, said Rosen.
“Every time we would meet, whether it be like for coffee or to talk about
a paper, he would always bring up something that Joe had done or John
Paul had done. It was really tourhlngt He was ﬁlled with an endless
