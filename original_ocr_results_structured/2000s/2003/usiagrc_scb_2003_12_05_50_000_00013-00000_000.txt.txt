In Defense
of Dan

since l fir-sr ei-rived Glllmcll College. l have been proud ro be a
parrofsuch e rolcienr end ope. irrindcd coirrmnniry. However, in
reccirr weeles, my confidence in rhis oomrnnnrry has been slowly nire
dermined and firrelly sherrcred. l arn wriring here because I believe
rhis is en issue rher irnpeers rhe enrire eempns eominuniry. lir rhe
name oerlferlghteousness end indignarion, rve heve eonrmirred e
hypocrisy by wrongirrg one ofonr ovvn in rho seine way we eecuse
him ofvvronging ns.

Dan crossberg has been my friend from rhe rirne he arrived er
rhis iirsrirnrioir. l neirher agree ivirh all ofhis lifeson decisions iror
do I mean ro say rhar he is enrirely blameless iii whar has happened.
However. in no way have
his eerions merired ehe
kinds ofoueiageons rumors
rhar have been debasing
him. I personallywirnessed
rlre firsr, and only, iirsrance
ofhemssrnenrcvcrrcporred
egainsr him and rhongh he
may have been our ofline,
his eerions in no wey can-
srirnred harassmenr. nor
were rhey sEXunL nor wes
he ever forced ro lenrve any
school as a resulr of any
sexual offense. indeed,
Dan, rogerhcrivirh orir ed.
minisrrerron, has arrively songhr ro disenss grievances orlrers have
hedwrrh lrinr, bur no one hes come forward

Due ro Dans forward per-soneliry, many people, myselfinelnded,
have or sonre riine fclr ill er ease erourid him. Though his is nnii
rcnrional on his pen, when rho slighresr riimorofslserehincss is added
ir is iior dimculr ro see how peoples perceprions could be elrered and

Well, if rhe frfrh principle ofsclf-govcmancc leaves Gririnellieirs

roo have a concern ro voice. ln Demo Mecronehen's lerrer ro rhe
