in John hommereim's ofﬁce, an unusually Large
choral book e so big it hung over the sides of the
music stand — was open, displaying pages upon pages
or staves and penciled names. he looked at it awhile
and then said, ”Someone should really come take a
picture of this.”

The book contained the sheet music tor a AO-yaice
piece. The ones who will bring it to lire are the
Grinnell Singers.

The 52 person choir will hold its ﬁrst major concert
this year on Friday, 14 Nov., 7:30 pm, at storing
Lewis Hall. A new and diverse repertoire will showcase
the choirs versatility.

”We are performing pieces dating from the 16th
century all the way up to the 21st,” said Nick
Malinolvski '04, a member oi Grinnell Singers.

are of the highlights of the upcoming performance
is Spem in nlium, a Latin piece by English composer
Thomas Tallis. This ho-vnice motet divides the choir
into eight groups.

The majority or the members sing a numher of
separate parts. hommeieiin, founder and director at

singers, described the piece as "aheutthe Creator of .

Heaven and Earth, so a lot is going on and bouncing
around," adding, "I thought it would be a fun
challenge.”

Members of the choir agreed. "We've been learning
this [piece] since the beginning of the semester,” said
Sarah Burghardt’oé.

”Every Sunday would be spent just for [Spem],”
Lorin Ditzler ’05 said, ”I have deﬁnitely had to spend
more independent time this year."

Rommereim shares his (half: dedication. The eight
separate choirs for Spam met for an hour each with
hommeieim every Sunday. “Everyone has to pull
together,” he said. "or else it won't work.”

Another featured piece is Leonardo Dreams of His
flying Mozhine by contemporary composer Eric
Whitacre. “It made a splash when it premiered in 2001
at the National Choral Directofs Convenilﬂn,"
Rommereirn said. The piece focuses on Leonardo da
Vinci and his discoveries with ﬂying. It also includes
direct quotes from da Vinci’s notations in Italian and
whitacre's unique harmonic and rhythmic techniques,

Kalisiratov, who Rommereim met while in Moscow; the
Kyn'e from "Mass for Double Choir" by Frank Martin,
which the composer wrote as his gift to God and left
unperiormed lor thirty years; and An die steme by
Robert Schumann, which Rommereim describes as the
composer “conversing with the stars.”

With this collection of pieces, the members of
Singers proudly emphasize their growth. ”The pieces
have made us better musicians,” said Elizabeth Simon
'05, They believe that the group's growth will make
the concert a positive experience. ”Even it you don’t
know a lot about music, you'll ﬁnd it enjoyable," said
Simon. ‘

”And even if you do know a lot about music, you'll
hear a lot ofinteresting new things,” added Ditzler.

Ifthat is true, then Rommereim won't need to ask
for pictures.

Grinnellrans write
novels in a month

by Brendan Mackie

Many people see wriring a novel as an unattainable
dream rher involves simply too much croariviry, work.
time and commitment. Calling itself“: fun, smterr
youreosnrs approach ro novel writing," National Novel
Wruing Month, or Nanownmo, seeks to change rhis
altitude. Naneivrrmo challenges people to write 50,000
words cha novel in the month of November. Four
Grinnell students have taken up the challenge this year:
Carly Schunn ‘06, Jacob DeBower ‘06, Amanda King
’07 and Mary Parker ‘06, Eryn O’Nci1’07 and Elizabeth
Greeniocrg '07 were parricipanrs losr year.

Nanowrimo encourages aspiring authors to ﬁnally
start writing that elusive navel, rind because ofirs time
constraints, expects its participants
to “aim low M."

“I acrually rhought ir looked
prcrry stupid," said schunu,
“occeuse rhc emphasis vies on
quantity otivords versus quality oi
vvriring and normally I would have
rhoughr rhsr [hill was not a good
rhing. Burl decided jusl ro give it a
char anyway just beans: 1 thoughr
it was such a cool concept.”

The project hopes to encourage writers to wrirc by
providing them with a deadline and wirh a sense of

community. The Nanowrimo website said that: “[o]nc of

(he hesr rhings about NeNowrih/lo is rhe way it spreads
the agony olcrcerion throughout a Large community of
cosuiicrers."

King said. "Beam: no the national novel thing char-s
my moriintion rode it; 1 normally wouldn'r get inro ir
otherwise, l'rn iusr like: I can do rhot later. But now
there’s a deadline :lndl Feel like I need to get ir done.“

And getting it done is rhe rocus uFrhls month.
Everyone who completes the 50,000 words chdlenge is
declared e “winner" and has their name primed on the
page of winners. The event has gemerccl rmmcnse
inreresr in recent years: only six participants completed
novels in 1999. while over 2,000 pnnicipnlus completed
novels Lesr year. This year rho group is expecting 4,000
purple to ﬁnish novels.

But what hincnS In those novels once they are

written? Grecnhcrg, who parucipared last ymr, said char
her novel is soil “on my computer back homc. I was
actually Looking back or. it this year. and I was drinking:
1 didn’l like the way char it turned our. 1 rhoughr I could
rewrite it this year our 1 didn’t feel like I had enough ofa
sense oran overarching plor olche whole rhing." Most
participants do nor even ﬁnish the challenge. O’Neil said
that her unﬁnished novel is “in a closer somewhere,"

King. who had erremprcd a novel lasr year and is
crying again, sud, “whar's going our at rhis poinr [in the
process] is n hunch ofprcteniious crap. so no one will
mud n. Possibly nor ever."
schuna, however has grander ambitions. “I’m going to
have to Ler [my novel] sir for maybe a couple ofweeks.
rhen I’d go back to it and revise ir
and work our some orrhe plot
holes. And rhen, depending how
good 1 dunk ir is, iflt mighr he
publishohle [I mrglrr send ir to
some publishers], I’ve wanted to
ho a published aurhor since 1 was
six years old. It’s my ulrimare
dream."

The pardcipane agree char rhe
projecr is very time consuming.
schuna said, “i usually just make sure char i get all my
homework done as soon as I possihly can and then I use
all my free rime to write and reach the word count that I
need every day.”

undoubtedly, rhe writing ofa novel in a month rake
time. Greenhcrg said char lasr year wriring her novel
“look up maybe one or two hours a day." Smdenrs cope
with the increased workload in different ways. King said
diet "it's weird, like, somewhere in my head this last
week ir switched that since 1 was working on my novel I
didn't have ro do my psychology reading anymore, an
rher's not been working our so well asl have a rear this
Friday so I'm klnd orhaving to sacriﬁce rho novel today
and tomorrow ro carch up on die reading for char. so it's
kind otgcrung rhc balancing not right as the momenr."

At the cnd otrhe ordeal, hopefully wirh a novel
under her holr, King said, "[1 am] deﬁnitely planning on
hovmg on end of rho monrh perry or something. Just to
rhank God it's over."
