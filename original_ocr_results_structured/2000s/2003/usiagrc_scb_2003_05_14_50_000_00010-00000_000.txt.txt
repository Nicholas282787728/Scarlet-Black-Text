Death as a life
expeﬁence

Aftcr teaching two courses on dcarh and dying, I am, more than
ever. profoundly moved by rhc impact ordcath on our community
ofcrinncll College. Nothing intrudes into rhc rhythm orevcryday
he like death, and we often try to push it to the margins and reclaim
normalcy as quicklyas possibleThe students and l who have snidicd
and talked about death together have discovered the posiuvc trans.
formauon that can occur
when wc move the "death"
cicphanr from the corner to
rhc center or the room and
give voice to our recognition
that we arc mortal creatures.
painfully and wondrously
human, oll ofwhom will ul»
timorcly die.

I believe nothing related
to death is harder to under-
stand than suicide, particu.
larly the tragic ending ofrwo
young lives orsuch promise
oneofmy textbooks quotes
rhc father ofa young man
who committed suicide, who says, “Everyone has skeletons in their
closer, but the person who kills themselves leaves their skeletons in
mothers closet." Along with grief come the guilt and sclfquestion.
ing ofcach oFus: “What might we have done to prevent this?"

We are most healthy
when we stop, absorb
the feelings, verbalize
our rage, weep until
there are no more tears,
and embrace each other
so we know we are not
alone

Whatl hav: seen since Friday gives me hope in and {or this com.
munity Friends from all over the country have shared emails ofsui.
cidc experiences, and i am convinced that Grinnell college is not
unique or unusual because ourcampus has been touched in thisway.
Death happens. suicide happens. it’s wrenchiugly painful that it has
happened here, but that pain is a measure ofour mung about each
other, and that is good. Death, when it happens to anyone, deserves
to be rah by those who live on. We usually don't think ofdearh as a
lira experience. and yet it is, and we are most healthy when we stop,
absorb the feelings, verbolise our rage, weep until there are no more
rears. and cmhmcc each other so we know we are not alone. Further»
more. we gricwc in our bodice. in many diiferent ways, and they need
rime ro heal and be restored to normal equilibrium.

I have heard amazing remembrances this past week otLenko and
lonarhan. We can only hope they had some sense ofwhar they meant
ro us when they were alive. We can't understand their dearhs. and we
can’t provide the answers [0 why we die. Bur I believe we live [0 love
each orher and this world, and to celebrate life as precious. {cm long
as we have it and for all orthose creatures with whom we share it.
Grinnell is hurting because it is a caring place. and we are talking
about how we can be more attentive and caring here. For that I aru

thankful.

Reconciliation

This semester, I have had to face my depression hadron. I'm
glad I did, or I very well might have becn number three last week.
Before recording my comments about the college, I’m going to write
a bricfhistory of my illness, That way, perhaps my comments about
Grinncll can be put into context and hopefully others will gain the
strength to share their stories.

1 have an Atypical Major Depressive Disorder. Despite my un»
happiness as a child, I didn't see my ﬁrst psychiatrist until 1 Wu 17
because I was afmid. Sinc: then, I have gone from one medication to
three, visited our Mental Health center many times, and checked
myselfinto the Mercy Franklin Mental Hospital in Des Moinu early
last April. I've surrered one mayor panic attack, one major anxiety
attack, and several breakdowns. I olso arremprcdsuicidc twice in high
school, and used to be a regular cutter.

After checking into the hospital this year, i am determined to
overcome my depression. in the pasti have only tried to survive each
individual episode. but now i wont to prevent nature episodes. i am
trying to become kind oran expert on my condition. so I have read
books, talked willingly to proresionals. and am now working on die
long process ofrccovcry. Depression cannot be “cured," but it can be
pushed into a kind of remission.

Naturally. I have a lot to say about the suicides ofAmy, Lenka
and Jonathan. as well as
about Lhc college as a whole.
In my experience, the num.
her one method to begin
helping those with depres.
sion in a community is to en.
courage opcn dialogue. For
cramplc, if we discuss dc.
prcssion as a physical illnss,
like mono or canocr, data de—
prcsscd individuals may be more conﬁdcnr to reveal rhcir miscry to
others and get help.

Given what I have now revealed, I’d like to trprcss some recent
thoughts for rho sake or/lmy, Lcnko and Jonathan.

A month ago, Jennirer Krohn told me rhor about four rimcs the
regular number ofstudcnrs had checked into the mental hospital this
semester.

When was the last time you heard of the kind ofdiscussion about
mental illness that rhcrc is about sexual harassmcnr and abuse? 0r
about orhcr personal and scary issues, such as homosexuality?

When was rho lasr rimc you heard jokes about how it seems like
everybody at crinncll is on medication for mental illness? When was
the lost time the collage ofﬁcially disclosed any formal statistics on
the issue:

Tell people you love
them before you leave
for summer—it can
make all the difference.

- Has attempted suicide herore,

' Has had recent severe losses.

- 1s preoccupied with death and dying.

- Prepares for death by making out a will or ﬁnal arrangements.

Many people commit suicide two m three months into their recovery
from depression. This may be the ﬁrst time they see the problems
the depression has caused or have the emotional energy to act on
suicide threats. Because these people may not have overcome the
hopelessness and negative thinking that commonly accompany
depression yet, the increase in energy may lead to a suicide attempt.

When was the last time you felt as though a friend or yours (or
you, youisclfi needed to go for help, but ncvcrdld? lfyou did go, did
you got the help you ueededi

When we the last time you wished you had someone to turn to
late at night when you felt horrible. bur couldn't comc up with any
serious rcason why you felt that way?

I plan to tacditatc a group next year mlled [he Mcnral illness
Discussion and Support Group. Email mc iryou want to help, have
questions. or post want some advice. lm not holding any secrets.
And rcll people you love rhcm before you leave (or summer—it can

make all the diKcrencc.

Discussion and
remembrance

on sunday night rhcquttr community came together to mourn
the loss ofone ofits members. ionathan Raxler was an out gay man,
and as a community we miss him. It is borla wrong and unhir to say
that Jonathan killed himself because he was gay, but it is equally
wrong to ignorc his quccmss as we rcrncmbcr him.

As we remember, we all start to scorch for answers. and in our
scan-h for answers, we will never be able to answer rhc qucsrion of
why on one hand, to say that Jonathan killed himself because he
was gay, to make him a statistic orthc higher suicide rate ofyoung
gay men and women, would be a fallacy. on the other hand, queer
life resrs the metric orall irs members, and rho strength required to
survive in a homophobic society oncn puts addcd pressure on the
minds and hearts ofmany ofus. Sunday nighr we honored Jonathan
through discussion and remembrance.

We remembered his insane competitiveness while playing gin
rummy: remembered his love or bong islands; wc remembered
his generous cigarerrt donations, wc remembered his cvaluarions of
rho mmpie directorys photographs ormcn, we rcmcmbcrcd his pm:-
ence at the big gay conference, we remembered his willingness to
listen

in sharing our stories aboutlonothan, Concerns about discussing
his death arose, and we also started to talk about the tear orsimplisa
ricallyoquoring hissuicidcwirh his being gay. Discussingsuicrdcwhilc
recognizing ionarhans quccrncss in that discussion risks losing
Jonathans personality and uniqueness to a marginalisation ofhim
both as gay and as a suicide victim. This was the roar ordaosc who
came to remember him; however, we gathcrcd together to promote
discussion both about the loss ofhim and how his death has harmed
die alreadyavulncrable queer community

The pain orionarhan's loss hurt those who gathered in many
ways. asides the general fears and worries that Vex is as well as the
rest of the Grinncll community while we all head from his suicide.
personal reactions ofionarhan's friendkmany ofwhom were queeri
helped to begin the formerly silenced dialogue about general and
oommumtyspcciric dcprcssion. Among diosc prcscnr in the forum
that night, many shared their own experiences with suicidal thoughts,
depression and the pain of isolation. For rhosc members orour gath.
cred community without supportive families. the forum provided on
opportunity tosofcly articulate concerns about the torture as they face
rhcsummor and rheworld without rhesupportrhor mony ofushavc
bccn lucky enough to find here at Grinnell.

Amidsr our remembranccs of Jonathan, a feeling ofconnezredr
ncss and safety came out, enabling us to talk as a quccr and allied
community As much as Jonathan’s loss caused us grief, We were still
able to come together and discuss his death, queer suicide, and how
much both ordacsc separate issucs affected the queer community in
profound ways. We understand die ways in which identifying as gay.
lesbian, bisexual, transgender. or queer isolates each orus in a world
that harbors hare and homophobia. As qutcr studcnrs and human
beings, we understand the added stress of being queer and mourn
ionadians loss docp ly.
