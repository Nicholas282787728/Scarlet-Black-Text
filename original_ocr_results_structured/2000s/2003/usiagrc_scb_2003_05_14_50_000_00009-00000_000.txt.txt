On rhe plane home, numb and unable ro aeeess or

I now believe that our
grief, though we feel it
will kill us at times, is a
gift our dead give to us.
If we can ﬁnd the
courage to bear it, our
broken heart eventually

didnr do much ralking abour whar was going on wlrh me.
The norron of ralking seemed fuule. And even ifl had
known how to esk for help wlrh whar wm going on wida
me, Idon't know ifrhere was anyone around me who would
have known how to give ir.

I share mls now by way of asking you4ven plesdsng
wirh youim reseh our, now, ro rhose members of our
community whom you know and rrusr, so rhose people
available ro you who do know how ro help you deal wlrh
whats going on within you now. Share wioh rhem Muf-
Mr you may be feeling now, You needn’r be alone wlrh
how confused, frighrenod, angry, and existentially shaken
all this has made you.

Reaching our now may be rough or even impossible ro
imagrne. lr may mean breaking down barriers of privacy
and auronomy you've workod very hard ro erecr. I rhlnk
rhar was parr ofwharwas going on wrur me all rhoseyears

do exaorly whar I'm counseling you ro do, when my mom
rook her own life. i mighr have felr rhe pain more sharplyr
and rhe pain ofsueh loss ean be searrng indeed. Bur is
would have been vasrly berrer rhan rhe
numbness I felr, and rhe numbness
rhrough which I suffered for years if»
rerwards.

I finally drd ger help wiLh my feela
ings, and rhls changed my lrfe in ways I
eouldn'r have ansicrpared. l'll close now
by sharing somerlring I wrose so some»
one else who was snuggling in rhe af—
rermarh of John Mohan’s death, abour
whar rhe srruggle ro cum: ro rerms wirh

Though 1n the momonr ofoursuf.
fering 1r we feel rhar grief musr rear us
apart, ir actually ends up being one of
life's grear blessings—nor rhe grief ir-
self, bur our abiliry to grieve. Grief ul-
rimarely rises our ofrhe surfelsofour love forone modieri
a love rlrar is so great shar, ulrimarely, rlre world and our
morsal bodies mn’r supporr rr. I fnsr began ro realise rhis
when I was ralking ro a very wise older frrend of mine one
day abour my morher's dearh.

This was rwo ymrs after my mom had died. I was feel.
ing srunned, as I talked to my friend, rhar rhe gnefl felr
was srill so fresh, I rhoughr rhere musr be somedaing wrong
wirh rne rhar I was shflgrreving_rhar rhis was evidenee of
some weoknesr or flaw in me.

My wise frrend heard me our, and rhen he said some.
rhrng ro rne rhar I knew. rhe momenr I heard ir, I would
any wirh me all my life. He said (in pan) rhas for me ro
rell myselfl oughrquiekly and msily so ger over my mother's
death was ro prsume rhas her life wasn'r ofanyreal impor—

ranee, and rhar rho lovel felr for herwas rransirory, as llghr
as Brazil and as passing.

In due momens, raklng inwhar my friend said, irmade
sense so me rhas she griefl feir was so sharp, and rlrar pass
of whas made 1r so sharp~what made is feel a sickness ro
me insread ofslmpie loss—was rhas I was rrying ro push is
away, ro deny 1r. The rhing rs, ro deny my griefwas to deny
my anhcrs rmporranoe ro rne, rhe meaning of her life.
Tim: was rhe problem nor rhe griefirsel If. A single human
life is rerribly imponanr, and when ir ls losrilosr through
an aer as senseless m suiorde our seem ro irs survivors—
rhar loss ran seem infrnisely more sernble.

What are she survivors ro do? How are we so console
ourselves? I now believe rhar our grief, though we feel ir
will kill us ar runes, is a gifr our dead give ro us. lfwe can
frnd rhe courage ro bear ir, our broken hearts evennaally
heal, They’re never the same, of sourse, and that’s righrr
Orherwise, ir would be as rfour dead had never lived, as if
we had never loved rhem

And when our hearrs evenrually heal, they’re aerually
larger. I would never have chosen ro lose my morher, of
course, bur there drd some a day when i realized I knew
more about rhe world bemrue ofrhis loss, several people

rually rhe world itself, and knowing rhls and ehoosing ro

courage in allowing ourselves so feel is, despise our fear,
rruly herois, one ofrhe reasons rhe angels musr envy us.

I don'r know ifany ofrhls speaks ro you ar an where

When someone
you know has
committed
suicide

Common emotions
- Shock. Shock is typically
a sunrivors' first reaction,
along with emotional
numbness. They can‘t
believe what has
happened.

- Cnnﬂlsion. Survivors
may never know why a
person felt the need to
take his or her life,
Realizing this is part of
the healing process.

. Grief. Many upress
their grief through crying
often, easily or
unexpectedly after losing
someone they care for.

- Despair. Feelings of
sadness and loss can erode
sun/ivois’ appetites,
ability to sleep, energy
and relationships, oﬁen
leading to temporary
depression and, in extreme
CASES, to more severe or
clinical depression.

. Anger. Survivors might
become furious at family
members, friends,
community members or
themselves for not seeing
a suicide coming. rhey
may also feel angry toward
the person who committed
suicide for hurting so
many people. feeling and
expressing this anger is
part of the healing
process.

. Guilt. The ”if onlys" may
come back to haunt
survivors. "If only ! had
noticed the warning signs,
contacted someone or
insisted that the person
get help,” many think. In
time they will realize that
it wasn't their fault.

Seek help

It’s fairly common for
suicide survivors to
develop a mental illness,
especially depression.
Others experience intense
reactions similar to post-
traumatic stress disorder.

If you're having trouble
dealing with a loss, don't
hesitate to seek help from
a mental health
professional. Support
groups made up of other
suicide survivors also can
help you find your way
through the maze of
emotions and physical
changes you may be
experiencing.

Many suicide survivors
refuse to seek help
because they think its a
sign of weakness. But it’s
just the opposite: seeking
help when you need it is a
sign of strength, a sign
that you're taking charge
ufthe problem you're
facing.
