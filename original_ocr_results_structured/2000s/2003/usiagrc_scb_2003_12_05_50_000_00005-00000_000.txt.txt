student initiatives

. and obstruct the core values oi the College by interiering with

'=‘ students’ ability to form and participate in open communities

1- containing alumni, students at other institutions and members

oi the world community, the changes oiJuly 2003 should be

' revoked. The misguided and destructive nature of the changes
became immediately evident with their iDrCEd removal of the
Plans community irom the Grinnell servers in July 2003. For
example, the arbitrary nature oi the changes chills iuture
innovation, as potential developers have no assurance that
policy changes will be transparent.

Grinnell College vould beneht irom a legal ﬁle-sharing system
that provides lawACost and legal access to music and other iiles,
similar to the relationship between U. Penn and Napster.

Cognizant oi the imminent shutdown oi inﬁnite Technologies’
Webmail, 115 should provide and support an alternative to MS
Outlook Web Access (UWA), incorporating the security ieatures
oi WA and preserving the low bandwrdtb and simple interiace oi
Webmail. rhe incompatibilities between WA and various
operating systems, email clients and browsers make it a poor

. choice ior the sole web mail reader ata college with diverse
computing resources.

We the student body oi Grinnell College acknowledge diversity
in religion and respect the religious beliets or the Gn'nnell
college student body and community members. it is in this
spirit that we propose to provide a rooi ior the idol oi the Hindu
god Ganesha, located on campus between the town and the
iiobert N. Noyce science building.

Ganesha is the prominent hindu god oi success and the
destroyer of obstacles. He is one of the most familiar fates of
hinduism. An idol oi Ganesha was brought to Gnnnell following
the death or a student, Jamison Russell Curran '01. A Hindu
brahmin (priest) was called irom Chicago and the idol was
installed in 1999. According to Hindu theology, successivl
installation oi an idol results in the presence oi that deity
within the idol. while the original plans did mention a shnne
with a rooi, it seems, that the root was forgotten,

As a result, the idol is vulnerable to the torces oi nature and
to the droppings of birds. The ideal step on the part oi the
administration would be to build the ”slime” walk and a root.
By passing this initiative, the Giinnell College student body
would be respecting the beliets oi a religion and would be
preventing any more dishonois to a god.

A reference for those who are still fuzzy about what each choice really means

We propose that a swingrset be built on campus, preierably
west oi the South Campus dorms. ihis swing-set would provide
joy and entertainment to all students, start and iaculty,
including their children. the community and oiiice of
admissions would heneiit as wellihoth Davis buddies and
prospective students would be drawn to the youthiul structure.
Swinging promotes ﬁtness, and allows students to revisit their
childhoods. Have you ever met a stressed out kid? Well, we
haven’t. We think that swing sets are a key part oi a child’s
happiness and social development. Like younger kids, college
students could use the swings to interact with one another in a
socially appropriate way, and ﬁnd this healthy activity very
stress—relieving. Don't iorget the endless study break
possibilities, such as iumping-oii contests, pumping
competitions and synchronized swinging. Please, as you cast
your vote on this initiative, imagine yourseli swinging and how
awesome that would be.

Students have thus iai been unable to remove compact
disks irom hurling library on the grounds that students may
make copies oi them. This possibility will always exist, given
the iact that most iorms oi media are now susceptible to
reproduction. However, this issue seems to warrant a cost-
beneﬁt analysis. Copies (an be made oi books, journal
articles, sheet music and videos; however, these diaivbacks
are clearly outweighed by the potential beneﬁts. The iree
exchange oi iniormation is much oi what makes our society
iree. This tree exchange is signiﬁcantly iacilitated by access
to multimedia sources. Thus, it follows that students should
not be denied the ireedom to check out CDs. this level or
acces 'lrility, this iieedom, will also allow ior more individuals
to utilize this large, diverse and robust resource, in order to
better themselves and their communities.
