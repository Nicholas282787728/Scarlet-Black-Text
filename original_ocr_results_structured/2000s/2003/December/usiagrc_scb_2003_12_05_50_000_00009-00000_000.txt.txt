“Weird things happen" during rehearsal
according to Kyle Schmidt ’04, student dic
rcctot ofll/lrztc/J Palm. Quite a few of the
directors agree that the process orditecring
the One-Acts has taken on a life ofits own.
Schmidt l‘cCOlanCd rehearsal: in which tht-te
were times when mistakes which ended up
with Schmidt telling ills actors “I don't
know what you did. or how you did it. but
that's deﬁnitely going in the play"

lohanna ivlarvel ’05, one ofthe actors
in Alt/amoral»: said that Gtinnell’s Ollc»r\ct
Festival allowssriidents who would not nor»
mally participate in theatro to get a taste of
ivliat it's like, Therefore plays that perhaps
stray From the tiorm riro ploduccd and
shown. Marvel said, “It’s a more experimen-
tal chil'onlncnt, whereas the rest of the
Theatre Department is it little more Struc-
tirrod, I would say. It gives us a chance to
see what we, as stud “S, can do on our
awn.n

Adi icnnc Celt '06, also ofMatchpolnt,
said “Our GUI has, multiple timrs, consid-
ered dropping rhowholo onc-tlcr thingand
piiisiiing siich oiitside careers as a circus
tronpe or professional mquetbull squad.
Though none orthose ideas has yet come
to fruition, we've genemlly had hm anyway."
Carpp, an actor in TbcM/m Who Cort/dot
Cry, echoed the sentiment that “rohcarsals
have heon prion ridiculously silly. but nirvt
ortheless productive. "

So what are the One-Acts?

student directed One»Act5 are part of
the Theatre 208 rt-quitemcnt for tllcThc-
atre major, According to Chris Connolly,
Theatre. who is the faculty advisor for the
course. the One-Acts have hocn aiound
since way before his time. it is only in to
coat years however, that the emphasis has
been on smaller class sire and the handsmn
approach.

According io Connolly. the students
"choose a onceact play, develop a concept
for ii, which they then present to the class,
revise that, make a iirritten report, and as .t
gioiip, cast their shows and then hold tcc
hearsals "

These rehearsals aie limited to eight
hours a week, while plays are limited to 13
pages and to a cast or hire characters.
Connolly said that these limitations arc to
ensure focus on the two core concepts or
directing; working with the text and worlc
irig wiih actors. Research forcncdcl plays
starts the summer bclure fall, according to
Hannah Phelps '04. one ofthc student di»
rectors.

Who’s involved in ii and what‘s
it all about?

The eight student directors this some
tet are Mark Bourne ‘04, Kirsten Plowman
'04, Care Bardelson ’05, Hannah Phelps
'04, Jenny Nelson ’04, Margo Gray '05,
Jennie Moscori '04 and Kyle J Schmidt '04
They chose a wide range or playwrights
from David Mamet to Frank Gilroy and
Romtilirs Lindlcywhilo content oiihc plays
range from all lawyers going to hell, to an

internal tennis game that's going on in the
world to the power oflost poetry.

The casts for the one.Aco consist of
actors from the intermediate Acting class
and those selected from campus wide audic
rions. The student directors were required
to incorporate actors orditi'erent experience
levels. While that was considered a poten—
tial hurdle, most ditcctors' experiences
proved orhonvise .

Schmidt’s cast orcharactcrs will dem
onstrate how actors with dirrerent levels or
experience ht iogethtr in a short. Jenny
Rosenhaum ‘07, Adrien ~Cclt no and
omondr Kasrdhi ’05 have widely different
acting Experienccs. Schmidt pointed out
also that the actors have become role mod»
els for one another, and often sct rho pace
for each other

Nelson, who has two relative novices

said. ”Oh rriy god, my actors

, \c!" Nonetheless, she said that

she's “seen them grow so much" and that

“thcydon't {all into thesame little traps [that
other more cxpcricncud actors do]."

On Directing

Although Connolly sits in on a couple
ofrchearsals, he does riotcornmiinicate dic
rectlyrvirh any orthe actors. Rather. he tako
notes, mosily in the term or qllcstlonsr
which in theory, he said “the directors .uc
frcc to rise or ignore."

Phelps said that avoritahleand oﬁclimtd
mantra is that Connolly gives the student
directors “enough rope, but hopefully not
enough to hang ourselves with!”

Schmidt alluded to a level ofrcsponsi-
billty as a dlrecrot that most of them have
not expcrienccd herore There’s a lot or
preparation that goes into rehearsals, and
according to Schmidt. “the actors know
when you don’t know what you're doingl"

The actors themselves realize the effort
that tho strident directors have put into this
proyect. Gina Tariillo ’06, an actor in
Alt/irritant said, “[My director, Gray] ho
taught me so much. I have been really im.
pressed by the power ora strident director,
and how seriously she has taken this role."

The strident directors act as “sounding
hoaids roteath other." according to Nelson,

According to Connclly, there is a lot of

with. However, Connclly hopes that in this
case, it will provide a learning experience
for boat the student directors and actors
The directors do not only give the actors
grades, out the actors in turn will he hulpc
ing grade their respective directors.

Phelps, who identiﬁes herselras an ac.
tor by trade, round it interesting to have to
"put yourself into their shoes as an actor,
and then give them notes as a director."

The actors’ One-Act experi—
ences

Tarullo revealed that Gmy, as a student
director, had gone to great lengths to en»
sure that the .rctois gained a hill undeﬂtﬂnd»
ing oftlio world in which their play is set.
”And I do mean ‘giveat lengths“ the said.
“\X’c‘vo done everything from singing to
acting like dogs to dancing to sitting under
a stairwell for an hour."

Nick Santiago '05, another actor in
Alt/rrrroiooa said, “Though the onencts
have bcctl an crazy experience. it has also
been a positive one." He attributed the posi—
tivcctporionocot‘studontsworkingtogether
to create theatre to the “talented and dedi-
cated directors "

“in exchange for no more than eight
hours a week or my time, I have enjoyed
the company and knowledge orrhree grtar
cast members, explored my abilities as an
actor, and got to do weird cruir that only
actors in a closed space could ﬁnd normal,"
Kasidhi said, “i have grown as a porsorr, and

-that makes me feel good."

similarly, Glapa, said “it [the whole
experience]; been a challenge, but a lot or
fun. it was a good opportunity to work
intensively on a short piece ., to really dig
in." Carpp, on the othcrhand, enjoyed that
the One—Acts presented him with the per—
foct opportunity to get his feet wet in a
small. low-stress, and close—knit group of
people. He added, “despite whatever jenny

What should the audience ex-
pect?

The ﬂuLllEncE wlll be exposed to differ

Phelps, strident directors this term consists

cial lies, heaven and hell, crazy swimming

Glapa admits that she’s “cxcitcd to see
