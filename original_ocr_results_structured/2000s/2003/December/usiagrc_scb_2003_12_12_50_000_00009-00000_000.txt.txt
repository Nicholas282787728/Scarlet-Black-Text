Band to perform
upbeat concert

by Trymore Magomana

Instruments have been wiped elean, guitars elaborately tuned and
musical skills honed for the upcoming Grinnell Jazz Ensemble concert,
come Friday 7:30 pm, the group, conducted by Sandy Brent, is slated to
stage its ﬁrst concert this academic year in Bucksbaum’s sebring.Lowis
Hall.

“The good thing about the concert is that you ean danee if you want
to," said Amy Donahue '05. the only female in the ensemble.

It is widely anticipated in the szpus music eireles that the concert
this year will be utterly diirorenr from the previous ones. Problems that
the group experienced last year when they staged the same concert haven't
recurred, members said. Last year, the group had no bass player.

“The good thing about the concert is that it’s short and upbeat," said
Sam Cntmor '04. one or the soxophon: players in the ensemble. The con.
eett is expected to last a little less than two hours.

“Anyone rain come and join" as long as he or she is ”able to play an
instrument or have some idea about how it works," Ctamcr said

The jazz ensemble holds is practice lessons every Tuesday evening in
Arts loz. Those interested in watching practice are iveloonie.

that practice started at the beginning or the semester, taking rive days to
learn eaeh dance. “we do everything from jazz. tap to lyrical, hip-hop."

“A lot orthe sturrwe're doing this year is more challenging" she also
said. “It doesn't require as much sloll as it does cndunnoe."

Along with their independence, Dance Team is also unique in Grin-
iiell for being the only dance group involved in eompetition. Root said
that the group will be returning early from winter br=ak to take part in
one competition and are looldng Forward to more in the earning semester.

Despite the efforts or Danee Team to be distinctive and make a name
for themselves, Tran and Root tool that danee in Grinnell needs to develop
further. “For one thing, there's no dance mayor," said Trans “and we eanlt
danee at games."

“I think the problem is that some people think our danees are cheer-
leadenlrke." said Root, “But these dances rok: time and errort, and we
know they're not something silly."

Both Tran and Root express excitement about Friday's show. “Ifdre
audience is into it, it makes it more hm," said Root,

“I enjoy Dance Tam," she added, “it's rull orgood people. and its
good exercise."

average a cappella group," said Lorin Under
’06 of Con Brio, Grinnell College's only
coed student.tun a oappella group.

The rest or the grorip laughed and
Jonathan Horowitz '04 added. “GrinncL
llans do not realize how little Grinnell 1
cappdla names such, really,” he said. ”All
orthese other a cappella groups rrom omer
universities have the lamest names."

Horowitz was rererring to the other a
cappella groups that Con Brio competed
with at a Truman state a oappella festival
several weeks ago in Missouri, “We had a
wild, great time." he szld.

Con Brio received high honors at the
festival for their performances and student
arrangements All but three members orthe
group have arranged songs at one time or
another, and AycockY Rohan Mandelia ’05
and Alex Lmeh '06 have arranged songs to

Lounge.

“Something that’s sort ofunique is we’re

doing lots or student arrangements this
time," said Mandelia. Can brio's perforr
mance will include ﬁve old songs and ﬁve
new ones, such as minderﬁrt origin and
The \Who's Pin/ml! lVilerd.

“[Likc the erronesi, we both do Corr
temporary pop songs," said Dialer.

“[but] we ean sing diiierent pans and
more music, [since we're coed], “added
Mandelia.

The group uses a demoeratie process

going to have reheatsals, and he ﬁgures out
the sehedule rot caeh rehearsal, when we
do eaeh song. [and] how long we spend on
eaeh song, it’s quite scheduled; we follow it
pretty well."

Con Brio was founded in 1998 by Nate
Gagnon '02, Gina Diﬁno '01 and Adam
Gratch '01, “They decided they wanted to
sing a whole bunth ijau’rgospel nrmngcr
ments, and they couldn’t do it in [Grinnell]
Singets, and so they got together," said
Horowitz. “They picked some really stu—
pid name, like ‘Walkin' on sunshine or
something, [and] almost dissolved several
times during their ﬁrst year."

The name Con Biro, meaning “with
vigor" in ltaliair, was devised by later mem.
bers or the group.

Group names at the Truman state a
