Grinnelliarls register with INS

New federal immigration requirements on visitors from Islamic countries take up students’ time and energy

At 6:40 Tuesday morning. four crinnell students
gathered at the Forum parking lot to travel to Des
Moines for their 3 am appointment with the Immi»
gratlon and Naturalization Service (1N5). Under new
policies passed after the sept. ii terrorist attacks, male
international students of cerizln nationalities are now,
suhyccr to special registration with the INS.

“I just want it to he over and done with," said Don
Khandlcar '05 on Monday. “Just put me on file, what.
ever. I just hope it doesn't get
worse. I don’t think itwill, buryou
never know."

At the INS ofﬁce, a line of
people waited to register with M
ofﬁcials. Grinnell students were
called forward, photographed, fine
gerprinted, questioned and asked
to take an oath that the informa-
tion they gave was valid,

The INS asked Khzndkar for

information on his parents' ages

credit card information,

Security checks for nonermmigrant foreigners come

tional students that hegan with the passage ofrhc USA
PATRIOT Act in Oct., 2001. On Feb. 19, Director of
International Student Services Janet Alexander held an
information session outlining new regulations.

At Grinncll, male international students from
Bangladesh and Pakistan are suhiect to special registrar
tion. “They say they haven't selected [countries whose
residents undergo spccial registration] hecause rheyre
Muslim countries, said Alexander. Its true that North
Korea and Cuba at: on the list, and they're not Muslim
countries." Students attending the Infosessicrn in South
lounge laughed.

“Muslim countries are definitely ta.gctcd

day. “The INS is traditionally understaffed and under.
funded," said Alexander. “How in rho world arc they
able to keep up with nil this on top ofthcir regular work?"

With integration of the INS inro the Department
of Homeland Security, the INS focus has hcen moved
away from service. With a flood ofnew paperwork and
regulations, offices are understaffed and information
processing goes much more slowly than expected.

This year, Pakistani and. Egyp-
tian ﬁrstcyents intending to attend
Grinncll were subject to special se-
curity clearance hy the state Dc.
partmenr. insrcad of taking 30
days, the process took up to five
months, said Alexander.

As a result, one ﬁIstcyur
missed International and New stu—
dent orientations, arriving rust in
time for the start ofclasscs. A Pn-
kistam first-year and an Egyptian
first-year were delayed so much
rhar they were unable to attend
Grinnell this year and will have to
reapply for their visas at Ameri-
can embassies hcginning, at the earliest, May 20,

lntcrnntional students are now expected to carry dreir
passports, visas and other official immigration docu-
ments with them at all times. “I don't know anyone who
does that," said Uday Chandra ’05. Though students
carry their documents when they travel, especially our
otsiate. very few actually rake their passportwith them
to the PRC or class in ARH.

if it were up to oinna Solomon ’05, his passport
and visa would never leave the hack of his desk drawer.
For many other international students, losing their docu-
mentation is a major fear, and this possibility increases
significantly when one has to carry documentation and
identification constantly. Ifstudents are found not car»
rying documents, they could he detained until they can
produce identification or until their identity is deter.
mined,

For Alexander, one of the challenges ofworhing with
the INS is the lack ofcontact. Questions on INS regu.
lotions are sent through an intermediary who deals with
all college representatives in a frvostare district and for.
wards their questions and comments to INS represen-
iatives.

When Alexander does have direct contact with the
INS. responses can he heavyehanded. At an INS forum
in iowa City on Oct. 23, 2002, Alexander asked ifstue
dents could fulfill thclhls requirement hy carrying cop.
ics.

INS representatives responded that “copies are no
hctrcr than no documents" and that students could he
detained until official documentation could he obtained.
The this also told Alexander that she could he arrested
for telling students not to comply with federal regular
(ions.

By Aug. 11, every international studcnr at Grinncll
will is supposed to he entered into the student and Ex-
change Visitor information System (SEVIS), a fcdcr.
ally sponsored web based daiahasc that Will iracic infor.
mation such as courses taken, employment, declared ma.
iors, and any conviction ofa crime by an international
student that the college takes judicial action on, stur
dents must inform the college of any change in resir
dcnce within ten days,

students who are suspended or dismissed must leave
the country immediately. and international students
must maintain a full course of study unless they have
authorization of academic difficulties or other :xtenu»
ating circumstances, Failure to report information to
the lNS could result, in worst—case scenarios, in depor—
ration.

Once again, governmental deadlines may he prov—
ing impractical. Though crinnell was certified to use
SEVIS in January. many colleges have not yet received
certification and SEVIS frequently experiences techni-
cal prohlems.

At a small college, said Alexander, students may have
an easier rimc than at a large university, “were working
very hard to keep studcnu informed, and we want to
reassure students that we are advocating for them."

"The government can’t use all the information, and
ldon’t know why they need it," she said,

on iull-time tacultyr We should increase and dryer
sify our full-time faculty. We also need to pay our
assistant professors more and develop better mecha-
nisms for turning temporary positions into peimz~
nent ones,

0n diversity: I honestly thinlr this school's diversity
is embarrassing (I'm tallnng numbers as well as rela-
tions)... ruinnellvn'll neither attract many minority
students nor create an atmosphere of support arid
understanding without increasing its faculty diver
sity, in the past ﬁve years, the number of minority
raculty has increased 50 percent, which sounds trite
unlilyou realize it has merely gone from 10 to 20.

Mostimportant goal: Opening up new and fresh ways
of getting student input and connecting the student
to the administration 30 they do not feel so helpless
regarding the academic system. 1 would hold infor-
mal strategiring meetings on issues of academic
concern as they arose. I'd also like to develop oetter
ways of getting student input on academic issues,

0n full-time faculty: We need to look at creating some
program to hire those who are already teaching here on a
tworyear temporary tontratt and also interested in my

ing a little longer... I would argue that a higher percent
age of the tuition increases should be directed towards
trying to make professor pay a little more competitive.

0n diversity: 1 do not believe that recruiting people hased
on their skin color and rrhat race they are is “diversity”.
Diversity to me means thinking about someones cultural
hactground, the views they would hold hetause of a dif-
ferent economic backgiound, and what their intellectual
views are.

Most important goal: focusing more on out ahility to ofe
fer a more diverse range or courses, such as Arabic, and at
the some time heing able to iorus on getting programs
such as the Dance curnculum and Japanese department
on more stahle ground.

0n fullatiine faculty: [MtGianahan and SGA President
Alejandro Dyanabal'usi proposed increasing assistant pine
fessor salanes in order to mate iohs here more appealing,
a proposal independently elahorated upon hy the chair of
the faculty. I feel that setting starting salaries at its
percent that of our peerinstitutions is a reasonahle prior-
ity.

On diversity: [increasing assistant professor starting sala-
ries will] lead to more competitive hiring and possibly
more tenure-track professors, Whith will give us the abilc
ity to diversify among new hires. Programs like Posst
that reach out to entire groups of students that couldn’t
otherwise attend will do wonder: for increasing the diver-
sity of our student body.

Most important goal: o increase student involvement in
the curricuur infrastructure. 1 was sort or iaded hy the
dismally low turnout at scc meetings last semester, but
through further education about what we have and how
it works, as well as hn'bery with pizza, 1 hope to get the
SEC and SEPC: more adivt- outside of their departments.

On full-time faculty: We need to ensure that base
salaries increase in order to attract better and more
diverse faculty. This will help Grinnell retain and at
tract those professors that we are currently losing.
Aha, increasing base salaries will likely give each
and every department a shot in the aim—revitaliz»
ing academics at Gn'nnell.

(in diversity: When we talk about diversity, there is
student diversity, iatulty diversity, and academic die
versity and all need to he dddiessed. A commitment
to lower tuition will attract more people and thus
increase the applicant pool. An increased applicant
pool wrll allow for greater selection in terms ofdivere
sity while maintaining high academic standards. fat»
ulty diversity is important in minon'ty representae
timi, ideological representation, and academic tuba
ﬁelds oi interest. We need to commit to ﬁnding the
most diverse faculty we can ﬁnd. The way we can do
this is to increase starting proiessors salan'es, since
this will attract more applicanu.
