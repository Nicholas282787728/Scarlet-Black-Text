they're mad as

hadly, nor to be angry wish them. Your
job is so do she best job you ean, even
listening to why rhey are mad as you. Pars
of being a presidenr or a dean is shas
somosimes people are screaming as you
unfairly, and if you lisren very elosely,
they're rorally righr ahour somerhing,
they're yuss being unfair in rho way rhoy
