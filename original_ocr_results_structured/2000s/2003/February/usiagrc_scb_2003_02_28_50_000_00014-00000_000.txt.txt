unconvinced
on Iraq

on Nov. 2, I told a crowd orcrinnell students and many other
Iowans in Des Moines marl was not convinced that we needed a war
with Iraq, Since drat time, inspections have proceeded. Hans Bllx
and Colin Powell have made presentations to the united Nations,
and the window for striiring Iraq in decent weather is nearly closed.
Yer now, four months later, I am still unconvinced. I am still
unconvinced that the threat ofIraq necessitates a war.

What threat dos Iraq pose and what roponse does that merit?
This direct has varied over time and relates in part to what weapons
Iraq controls. Iraq did develop and use chemical and biological wcap.
ons and had Interest in nudear arnrs. This is not in question. How-
ever. we cannot lools at this historical fact without also mmgniijng
our countrys supportive role in arming Iraq in the late l9sos' .Then
later mine the inspections posteGulanr. Until 1998 when UN
inspectors were pulled out ofthe country the inspectors oversaw the
destruction ofhundreds ofmissiles and other weapons as part ofthe
U.N. sponsored disarmament process, The question now is, what
does Iraq still have.) or. what has it developed since 1998? Here is
where much ofthe debate lies.

The Bush administration strongly believes that Iraq is hiding
chemiml and biological weapons. The inspectors have been unable
to ﬁnd anything more than emptywarheads to corroborate this claim
and Hans Blix has stressed that there has been no “smoking gun,"
The failure ofinspectors to ﬁnd the alleged material may be due to
dues things. one, Iraq is evading the inspections (or die inspectors
are inept). Two, the United states is hindering die inspections pro
cess with its reluctance to fully share intelligence with the inspec.
(01's.: 0r three, the us. may be exaggerating or fabricating the alt
leged Iraqi stockpiles. Without full cooperation in the inspections
process from the us or Iraq. those without access to classified infer»
msrion have a hard time evaluating the current situation. Evm sup.
posed intelligcnce should now be subjected to estreme skepticism,
During his proentation to the Security council, secretary ofstate
Colin Powell showed two satellite images ora quationable facility in
Iraq He used the photos to claim daat Iraq was evading inspectors by
moving things around before the u. N. visit. He neglected to mcnc
tion that the photos were taken two weeks apart 3 Questionable in.
telligencc is in even higher profile across the Atlantic. It has been
revealed that a British "dossier” on Iraq’s weapons capabilities was
blatantly plagiarired with some sentences being tweaked to rnalte
them more menacing.‘ I have to question why it seems that the us.
and britain have to make “intelligence" more convincing. Should
not the threat be evident enough.>

Beyond the question ofwhat weapons Iraq actually possesses, the
threat Iraq poses can also be examincd by evaluating how likely
Saddam Hussein is to malsc use of arty weapons he may have. In
otherwotds, can Saddam Hussein be containCd?Tl-lcrc are arguments
for and against this and I would concede rlrar neither 1 nor anyone
else can foretell the future. However, with the inspectors in the coun.
try. the world on the verge of war, and a French plan for stronger
inspections ifnecessaty, I believe that Saddam Hussein can be cone
rained. I also wonder why it is that between 1998 and 2001, when
there were no inspectors in the country, there wasn't the same em.
phasis on Iraq as there is today Why is it that the threat ofIraq is
such an issue now when it wasn't two years ago?

Many argue drat 9.11 has changed things. They contend that
now we must reevaluate Iraq in light ofterrorism. My response is
that there is no substantiated connection between Iraq and AJ-

Unfair portrayal

To the Editor:

I am writing in response to an article appearing in last Friday's
issue of the 5013 about student projects (“Finding the funding,"
Feb. 21). While I thought the article did bring up some important
issues, I also felt that the Tiiuana bools proycct was unfairly portrayed.

one of the areas the article focused on was concern over the high
cost of the project and of the increase in costs over the span of its
production. Having been responsible for handling the finances of
the book. l felt that there were a few things that needed to be clati.
ﬁed. First off, for anyone who has ever worked with a printing com-
pany before in coniunction with a college publication, you know
that it is very difﬁcult to get anywhere near an aoeurate estimate
without knowing EXACTLY what you want to print, right down
the number of pages and dimensions. I gave SPARC my proposal
before spring break, before I had any idea what I would have to worlc
with, and did my absolute best to give an accurate estimate. And
while my estimate was notably lower than the actual cost, it was not
$4,000 off, as the article stated In addition, Iwould like to poiirr out
that the increase in alloned funds for the projected was APPROVED
by the SPARC business manager. I do not, nor did I ever, have the
power to use student pubiimrion funds without approscrl ofthe busi.
ness manager or committee. For the business manager to call the
book prorcet in retrospect “a project that went bad“ is just plain ii.
diculous and unproressronal.

In the arrielt, Mr. Andersen also highlighted concerns about the
boolts distribution 1 thinlt it is fair to suggest that the distribution
process or the bottle could have been conducted differently That
said, however. I rhrnlt it is important to understand that ihrs book
was created with the intention of helping the student body by in.
creasing awareness about the Althrralt program at a time when it
experienced an unetpected decrease in funding. wcwanred the book
to not only be something for thc Grinn:ll community to enjoy, but
also to indirectly serve the students by spreading awareness about the
Airbrcals program, why it is important to the stiideiro and wiry it
should receive adequate funding. This was our chief purpose for etc.

Don’t be dishonest: just say ’hello’

Racism LTE reply

The letter to the Editor concerning racism in last week's issue
should be an embarrassment to the college. The author ofthe letter
has an oversimpliﬁed view of the role of race on this campus. The
fact that the author saw a representation of “gangsta" culture as a
reflecnon ofblaelt culture as a whole says much more about the preju—
dices of‘hnonymous" than any party organiser. As a Black student
who attended the Tupae party, I never felt that there was an aaump.
tion that all Black people are “lilse this "

However, I thinlt the letter was a reflection ofa greater issue of
race on campus. In my brief time here, I have grown increasingly
frustrated with some wlute studeno near obsession with “other"
culturos. While diversity issues should be a conccrrt of every student
on this mmpus, manystudenrs view minority groups as people who
need to be spolscn for, and notspolsen to. I cannot help but wonder
ifAnoirymous spolsc to any Black students on campus before writing
his letter to the editor. While no one will disagree with the ultimate
goals ofnnonymous. or campus groups like CARW, one is forced to
question their methods. White students are ntore likely to malsc as»
sumprrons on their own experience and have moved away from out.

Equally frustrating was the fact that “Anonymous"s letter was

Putting power into irrational hands

studenn speak out
about what’s on
their minds in 142
words, and you’re
invited! If you have
a random rant, email
it to me at
alward@gririnell.2du.
After all, complaint
ing in a public forum
is always more fun
than doing it alone.

 

Why is it the only people who post statements or
intents are SGA candidates? And why only this time
of year? lthink everyone should enthusiastically state
their intents. All the time. We’d all make resolutions
and keep them. In record time! Going to eat two desc
serts in Quad today? Type it up, print it out, and
pastel: on that bathroom stall. Just imagine loggia
windbws adorned with signs reading "Tonight, I plan
to leave my music blaring until 3 arm.” or "Tomorrow,
I’m not going to class" and individual names in big
letters underneath. If we all joined in, we could all
b2 impressed by ourinit‘iative, our frankness our fol-
lowtthrough. Self conﬁdence would skyrocket, negat-
ing the need for lang- -term concerns And the di5e
claimer ”Id love to talk to you, feel free to stop by
my room’ would work wonders For all kinds of' Int
tents.

—-Elr'sa Lensserr ’05

A random rant recently discussed responses to
"how are you?" People responding thatthey were tired
were just being honest. In general, saying "I’m ﬁne”
is a dishonest or meaningless response. It is the
commonlyatcepted (in much arus. culture) response.
It is eithetan intrusive and personal question urit is
a meaningless question. If you do not want to know
how somebody is really doing, just say "hello." I
personally hate the question ”how are you?"

Just say "hello."

—Cro:by the (insider ( i. e. not a student)

As a student I am much dismayed at the candi-
dates for the ofﬁce of SGA president. Does anyone
232 see a problem with the fact that the two Seriuus
candidates are both women? Frankly the prospect of
a female in such a powetrul ofﬁce is frightening. I
think Grinnellians should take a long look at where a
female president would get us. Should the student
body be subject to the whims of a member of the
irrational Sex? On reﬂection, I think all of us would
agree that women in elected ofﬁce is disagreeable at
best. In considering the electoral role women play, it
doesn’t take long to realize that changes need to be
made. 50 girls, stay home on Election Day. Send a
clear message to election board on March 5. Let us
not pursue political correctness at the expense of
keeping a strong man at the helm of our decision
making process.
