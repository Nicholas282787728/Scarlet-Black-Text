IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD.

Jw on February 14, 1939,
lran's Ayatollah khomeini

declared afatwa on the Indian-Amelie
can writer Salman Rushdie, calling on Muslims
to execute him as punishment for writing the
antielslamic novel The satanic Verses. Khomeini
offered eternal paradise (and a massive bounty)
to Rushdie’s killer. Nine years later, Iranian Presi-
dent Mohammad Khatami attempted to ofﬁs
cially withdraw Iran's support from the decla-
ration, though ltanian conservatives stood by
it.

Only 454 Americans vislted Iran in 1991,
making it less popularamong lls. toun'sis than
all but six countries in the world. The least come
mon desh'nation, wnth 18 American visitors, was
Niue, a loo-square mile island northeast of New
Zealand.

New Zealand contains about 11 times as
many sheep as it does humans.

in January 2000, the United states cone
rained about ii times as many people who could
identily Regis Philbin as the host of who Wants
to Be a Millionaire? as people who could idens
tify Dennis llastert as the Speaker of the House
of Representatives.

The fastestsever completion or the "fastest

YOU‘RE RIGHTl I NEED To MAKE
A MOVE, SEND SOME SIGNALS,
8E PROACTIVE AND TAKE SOME
MEANINEFUL RISKS. I'M

GONNA CALL SOME GIRLS I

Some V-day advice

sum/l aswell :
au fait

Happy valentine's Day! lfyou'rc a girl, you‘re probably feeling a lot of
mixed emotions today—wondering ifthe holiday is more about love or
more about obligation, fooling lonely or wanting space, loving and warm
ing to be loved. lfyou'rc a boy, you’ve probably lust screamed, “Oh shit!
lt’sValcnrine’s Duly? I’ve got to go acquire a talkingstuffcd
bear or a good excuse for not having a talking stuffed
bearas quickly as possiblul"

Personally, l'vc never gotten a talking stuffed bear or
a dozen roses or a little candy heart that said u R CUTE.
l have gotten disappointed, forgotten, and tr little candy
heart that said FAX ME with a little notc atitchod that
said NOT A EUI’HEMISM, PAL. sure, l'vc gotten a
lot olvaileutiiics Day cards, but that was back in grade
school when everyone was required to give a card to cv.
eryonc else in the class. even that girl who are pencils
and then threw up bits of pencil at recess.

But I’m older now, and more maiurc, andl only use
pencils to write things down. I've gotten over the want
forsroreelwughr love and the desire to fax someone real softly snd sweetly,
all night long. How then, should T treat the holiday.) 1 might say that it
would be enough for my boyfriend to embnce me and say that he loves
me, but when it comes down to it, that's something he does everyday not
to mention it’s really freakin' chcap. And sure, l want something nice, but
1 also don't want him spending money to show his love for me. The thing
is, nobody really know whatshe wants forValeirtrncs Day. Burl do know
what T don't want.

with her.

Where to draw
the l'ne

let me begin by commending Brian stoffcl for his ion, at letter on
atrocious fan behavior at the GrinlicllaCarmll mcns basketball game the
wcck prior. Mr, stoifel's lctrcrstrrkcs me as both ooumgcous and timeless:
courageous because of how hard it is to criticize peers and friends, and
timeless because discussion ofbad fan behavior seems to always have at
hand an unfortunate supply ofsallent examples. Most of the egregious
examples are elsewhere, but when one occurs on campus, it is cause for
the kind ofscrious reflection ihat Mr, stoffel's letter initiates.

1 also think Mr stoirel for educating me on the background of the
Carroll College playcniluhnn Swnrrziwho suffered verbal abuse by
some ofour fans. Mi. swarir story is one that should inspire [rcmcne
dous mpccl and admiration, but certainly irot .ibusc.

While being iii utter ddmilarlon oer. stoffol's letter, T am going to
disagiee with him in his suggestion drut itwas on this particular occasion

choice ofthe word “the." Tlic problem, as l sco it, is that we h c many

Do something she

expect, like rubbing

meat or breaking up

Do something by candlelight. Candlelight wins them overcvciy time
it doesn't matter ifyou’rc playing video games or taking a crap, as long as
it’s by the light ofa candle, she'll think its really romantic and you'll have
her heart forever.

Get an element of surprise. big heart—shaped boxes of candy taste
good, and roses look nice, but it’s been done a million times. Do some
thing she would never ever expect. like rubbing her with slabs of nw meat
or breaking up wirh her.

Don’t do anything really stupid. Justus 1 don't know

be okay to, say, invite your cx-gillfricnd to the romantic
valentine‘s Day dinner that your current girlfriend has
planned. Also—dour set your girlﬁicntl on the, toll he.

holiday,

Make hersomothing yourself, There's nothing more
romantic than an inedible homemade chuneror a badly
crafted poem. A horrendous rhyme like “roses are rcdl
violets are blue/ you are the dock/ for my canoe" will
surely stay with your loved one for as long is that
undercooked beef Romanolfshc choked down. or you
can make her a little homemade coupoir book that has things like “One
Free Backrubl” and "HugsiGivc One, Gel one Free!" and “Variety pick

Remember: love is never cliched. 1 don't know, tell her Love is a red,
red rose that Conquels all and that never dies, but ifir did, it would be
better to have loved and lost than to .rcvcr to hnvc loved or all, becausc
love is all you need. Or something. Maybe you should iust shout u R

“lines" in play simultaneously during a game. Some people may find it
acceptable to berate an official. but would “draw the line" at heckliug a
player. Another might approve of the latter behavior if, as suggested by
Mr, stoffcl, the hcciding was along acceptable lines such as making fun of
his physical appearance. And, 1: we observed on that particular night, a
regrettable few will draw the line even further down the scale toward i
plate Grinnell's own ioscph welcli may have had in mind when he asked
Joe McCarthy during those famous hearings, “Hove you no dtocncy, sir?"
The problem with having so many ltncs-in play is that they form an easy
series ofsrcps that bridge the chasm bcnvccn acceptable and nroancspire
ired fan behavior. When the crowd is lively andspirus are high, momcm
turn can carry many across more orthosestcps than they would dire cross
ifthoy gave it a moment's thought.

Mysuggcstiou for solving the too-manydincs problem is simple: stick
to one line. Tire line 1 propose is one that is articulated at the beginning
