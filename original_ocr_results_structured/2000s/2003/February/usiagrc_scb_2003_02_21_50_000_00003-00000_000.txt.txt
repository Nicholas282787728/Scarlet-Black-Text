Calling to make
connections

Phonathon, cont. from p. 1

Asking money from alums who paid four years oltu»
ition ro a school rlrar already has such a large endowment
can beadaunringraslc “W: learned in training how you’re
supposed to ask for money," said sabeen Sadiq ‘04, a newly
tiaincd caller, “I didn't like it at ﬁrst; in fact. my hands
were shaking during my first call."

For the experienced caller, arleing alums for money isn't
so awkward. “We have a relationship with these people,"
Tliigpen said. "We aren'rsrrangcrs calling these people try.
irrg ro sell them something,"

John Stone, Computer Science, sees Phonathon dife
ferenrly. “I think ir cheapons the image of rhe college by
associating it in the minds of alumni with telemarketers
and salespeople making cold calls." he said. “I personally
dislike receiving such calls from the universities that I at—
rended, so it would be hypocririml for me to support
Grinncll's use of the same technique. "

Many alums that callers contact through Phonathon
share Stone’s
sentiment. “If
s o m c o n e
doesn't w.i nt to
talk they’ll iusr
hang up," said
Brandi Green
‘03. “But a lot
of people are
nice and are
willing to talk.
Some of the re-
ally nice people
want to talk tor a very long time."

it is this mttracuon with the alumlii that maliy callers
like 'l'hrgpen and Yi find so rewarding, “Alums are very
Willing to help you with advice, connections and possible
yobs," 'l'lrigpen said, “People will be surprised at the won-
derful careers oill alums have established after Grinnell,
and more often rhan not, they are willing to sh‘ - with
you how they entered those careers,"

Yi i; now looking into a new career as a direct result of
a conversation he had during Phonathon wirh a diversity
trainer “His job sounded really interesting, and Ire told
me lshould call him ill Wanted to talk to him more about
it," Yi said. “I think it could be a job that's right fol me,
andI never would have Found that ill didn't have access to
all these alumni."

Yl isn’t the only one who was altered career advice dur-
ing his conversations. “The ﬁist call I ever made here lwas
offered an internship," sarafsiid. “Actually, rhe some guy
rold mc ro use his credit card number to buy beer for a
parry, iris-to long .rs i send him pienrres. otcourse i didn‘t
rrcrually do it, but it was an inreresting offer."

Brian storiel ‘04 has only worked since larriiary, but
has already had some memorable calls, “This one pcrsonl
(ilkcd lo, who had been a regular donor in the past, re-
Fused to give tl‘ik year because he didn't like rlre architec—
ture of the Chrysml Center or the new dorms going up,"
Stolfcl said. He also talked to a woman who had lived in
the same 4,0004tSldCl‘il town as hll“ near Milwaukee. ”lt
riirns out that Ire. sister and my family share backyardsl"

“You get asked really funny ouesrions," Green said.
“one person .oked what kinds of drugs people do here
now. The woman i just ralked to gave more money than
last year because she liked that the nan-re of the Fund was
changed lioi'n the Annual Fund to (in: Pioneer Fund. You
talk to all sorts oflntetculng people at this job."

"We have a relationship
with these people. We
aren't strangers calling
these people trying to
sell them something."

Most students spend their last weekend ofwinter break heading back
to Grinnell. This year, ﬁve members ofthe SGA Films committee spent it
in sundante, Utahwatthrng movies and rubbing elbows at the bestrknown
ﬁlm Festival in America. Two oFth:m were there at theii own expense, but
the other three had rec:lved a total oFSZOOO From the committee's coffers
to scout out promising independent films to bring to Grinnell.

Last spring. rlre studenr Publications and Radio Committee helped
support an alterirarive break in Ti niana, Mexico, by paying airfare for one
participant and promising to fund a book of her photographs from the
experience building houses for needy families. Atror rho trip, however, the
book's publishing costs unexpectedly rose above $4000, helping to drive
SPARC into a sevemlethousandrdollar deﬁcit that temcbteri At the and of
finals last spring, the leaders or [he Tijuana rrip distributed most ofthe
1000 books to faculty and stall"; the books haven’t yet been distributed
wrdely among srudenrs.

Lastweek, the newlyrformed Grinnell Cricket Club managed to gather
53000 in two hours to pay fora satellite hookup in the Harris Cinema ro
watch the World Cup of Cricket. A pair of cricket fans spent their after-
noon meeting with administiatots and students and the small hours of
the next morning watching rransglobal cricket in Harris.

And every year that proeess leaves the people who control the money
with a few rough questions,

Is this the bost use of mo money?

And maybe: But how will it Ian/t?

students looking for college money have an array ofpossible sources.
often depending on the narure of the project they're trying to fund. Be-
tween them, SGA and SPARC get $136 from each student's activity fee,
which they allocate to student proiectr like concerts, Hattis patties, and
the 5&3. Between them, rhe two groups helped fund each oi the ihroe
projects above. The student Aeiivity Fund (SAi-‘i is another Sourcc~lt

individual badgers for each office and department, many or which lay
aside limited Funds for special occasions. The largest chunk ofcash set olT
for- such “emergencies" is rhc president's discretionary hind, which helped
to pay for the sarcllite hookup.

“You'd hope that everything could be 100 percent beneficial to every/4
body," said Joseph Oppong '03, who :is rhc student government's [ma-
surer oversees all rlre funding rlrar goes rhroirgh SGA, “but in rho end you
can't have that."

Applicants forcollegefundmg, ofcourse,arc quickto note thewaysin
which their proiecrs benefit rhe Grinnell community.

Thanks to the Sundancc trip. according to Films Chair Tony l’lialn
'03, students will be able to attend some of the ﬁrst US. scieenings of
ihtce ltiwhudgct independent films this semcstu.

“A lor ofsrrrdenrs are constantly saying rhey want more independent
cinema instead of mainstream Films and Sundance really is the best source
for that in this country," said Pham, one oftlic ﬁve students to vrslt the

Sundancc, he added, also provided an opportunity to publicize
Grinnell’s own upcoming ﬁlm festival (see p. o) and gave the Students
who Wentith: ones who made it through the csszy (ontest that Pharn
organizedma rare chance to see the film industry's nuts and bolts.

The leaders of the Tiiuana trip, Denny David ’05 and Katie Mean
'03. didn’t mean to give so many boolo away. After the photographer,
Meghan Kirkwood ’04, took a few boxes to the presidents ofﬁce (to be
sent to rrusrccs) and the cenrer for Erperierrrial edumrion (to be put on
display), the group wanted to give copies to professors. But every time
tlieyrroppcdar an ofﬁce, all the support rraffers asked ioreopies too. in a
toy hauls, they were nearly our ofbooks David said they were likely to
distribute the remaining books eventually.

The unprediciablc publishing costs, Kitkwocid said, were impossible
to avoid. beam: Altbreak had cut funding for the trip only weeks before
the trip. Thar wasn't enough time to work out a solid deal with a printing
company,

According to Mears, one professor called the book the “most protes.
siorral" publication he’d seen the student body produce. The last tow cop.
res oirhe book were used ro advertise this year’s alternative break rnTiiuana
to would-be participants and sponsors; administrators who'd helped fund
rhe trip seemed proud ro have helped inalre the trip possible as well as
being pleased with rhe publication they'd received.

As for the cricket club, they were in a time bind as well—after rhey
boughr the dish, the rarellire company had unexpectedly decided to charge
ten times its original quoted fee. burVarun Him ‘04 and Ammat Pervaiz
'04 scraped together enough to pay the new fee. and as many as 40 stirs
demo from around the world attended the screening oflasr Friday‘s march
bcnveen india and Australia (more are expected for the March 1 mareh
between India and Pakistan). And the college now has a satellite dish in
Hams for future televised events.

Making tlicsc dcclsiolis no at least gotten more sysrematie in the last
few years, administrators noted with relief Before fall 2000, finding money
for anything was very complicated.

“Students would—as they do to a lesser degree now—go from puson
to person, oifree to olTioc, to ask for money," said Associare Dean for
Experionrinl Edircarion sieve Lnngcmd, “They would go to a department,
ask for 3100, go to anuther .. lithoy were able to get the money, it was
usually at he expense ofsomerhing else rhar deparrmenr or persun had to
do."

so rnree years ago, rhe administration sliced out bits ofeach
departments and crimes general funds and gathered rhem all inro the
smdonr Activity Fund, which Langerud now oveisces. students looking
for money for conferences or symposra go through a standardized applica.
tion process each semester.

In each year since, the funds has been fully allocated, though ir ho

all the money they applied for The hind has also been shrinking rapidly
from $70,000 in 2000 [0 about $50,000 today.
