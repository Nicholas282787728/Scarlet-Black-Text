Spr: Boys fantasize

& girls go wrong

How basketball may or may not interfere with your voyeuristic urge for a 13-year-old Chick’s
autobiography and an Italian womanizer’s fantasy.

Percusision Ensemble

there is more to the tambourine than meets the eye.
or car,

rho members ofthc Percussion Ensemble, including
itlok Shah '04, have learned this lesson by practicing the
piece Fan Forefor lumbauri'rrcs by John Alfieri, which will
be featured in the upcoming concert.

"It all depends on the visuaLi,” he said, ”It’s all about
when someone rolls, or slaps their knees."

Their diverse repertoire includes pieces from all areas
or the globe, original compositions and contemporary
works the group has also had the opportunity to work
and perforiri with a diverse group of professional
percussion artists such as Dave Samuel: and Ed
Sllaughnessy.

Director Mark Barr said this semesters concert will
continue to reflect that versatility and ”will feature a
distinctive international flavor.”

They accomplish this international flavor by
incorporating instruments from around the world,
including the conga, bass marimba, tom-tom, rotattom,
marimba, vibraphone and xylophone, beisides Fan Fare,
eight other pieces will be performed at the concert.
Stained Glass by David Glllingham stands out ror Shah.
“It has a lot of dissonance," he said, ”All the beats are
off from each other, but they still work with a structured
beats."

Ensemble member Sarah Smith '07 is most looking
forward to playing Field of the Dead by Serge Prokofiev,
which she described as slow and melodic.

"While the notes aren’t challenging, it is challenging to
be expressive," she said. _

Other pieces featured include Dill Pickles, a xylophone
piece by Charles Johnson, and Africa by Hora Purim,

In addition to diverse instruments and musical pieces,
the group also has a diverse membership that includes
people from both the college and community.

"Mark [burr] makes sure he incorporates community,"
Shall said, "These are the people who've built the
Percussion Ensemble, so wiry wouldn't they want to be
involved?"

In the end, the ensemble seeks to prove that there is
more to percussion than playing oile's own boat. Smith
reaffirmed the value of opening one’s mind to new
influences as well as the unconventional. "Even in
percussion, everything has a special sound,” said Smith.

Symphonic Concert Band

The Grinnell College Symphonic Concert Band has
something to celebrate this Sunday: freedom.

”This time, Mark [Dori] let us pick the songs for the
concert," said Diana Grimes '04. who plays clarinet for
the band, They chose songs including First Suite by
Alfred Reed and An American in Paris by George
Gershwin. The band will perform them on their upcoming
concert on Sunday.

Like the Percussion Ensemble, the band also draws on
a diverse repertoire, ranging from major wind and
percussion works to well-known favorites. Members of
the community are also a major part of the group. They
have also collaborated with guest artists, including Ein
Finkel last year.

Sundays concert is titled celebrations, which Grimes
described as an opportunity to celebrate music and to
break away from stress by enjoying music,

Director Mark Dorr said he wants "the audience [to]
feel that they are an integral part of the excitement and
energy ofthose performances." He added, "The audience
feels the energy of the music being produced and the
performers feel the energy and response of the
audience."
