This year, steianov interviewed for an incredibly com»
peritiv-e internship with Credrr suissc in New York; is was
steiaiiov's dream internship. “He gave me this whole de-
scription about rhc interview," said Musad. “He sold me
beiore he leir, ‘1 amgoingro get ii: Hewas so determined."
Mumd said that sceianov spent ﬁve hundred dollars Fret
paiing ior ihc inteivieiv, he bought a new suit and would
try it on to make sure that he looked just right,

“we had a common interest in shoes," said Murad.
“He wore really nice shoes. He knewl had a shoe fetish
antl so we would always ralk about them,"

The suir or rhe shoes musr have helped when sieianov
got back to Grinncll, rliere was a message irom Credit suisse
on b is voice mail that oiiered him the internship. He stood
in his doorway telling everyone on his hear about it as
they passed his room.

javed also landed an internship in New York; he and
sieianov planned to spend rime together and possibly hnd

housing rogether “Ir was a joiiir success for us [to get im-
pressive inr:rnships]," said javed. “We conquered it to<
gcrher The markets are doing so badly right now, so to get
something like this was great." Now that steianov won't
be there, javed is considering taking an inrernship in Lone

don instead of New York for the summer.

Interests and passions

“Over spring break, we got to work together," said
Mehboob. “For rhe ﬁrsr two days we went around campus
imaging and cleaning oomputers, then we spent the rear of
rho break in a room together for eighr hours a day doing
d1mentry."Mehboobwas a member ofa band in his home
in Bangladesh rhar put out two CDs.

“0n Tuaday ofrhc first week. he asked me to get my
CD, I gave him my two albums; us read onal
[Bangladeshij music l wasn'r sure he would like ir. l
rold him chat he didn’t have to listen to ir, but he really
wanred to. l thought maybe he was just being nice.

“The nexr dayl earne in and he had gotten there early,"
said Mehboob. “Lenko was listening to one or my

favorite era. “We sang along wirh the music," said
Meliboob. “He was a big fan ofDire semirs, The scorpie

he would put in my CD."

Mehboob doesn't know whedier Sreianov truly loved
his CD or ifsrefonov was just trying to relate to him, but
Mehboob believes char ir was in Sicfznov's chaiaerer to try
to make others feel at ease. “His intentions were always so
good," said Mehboob. “He would never straight out ope
pose you He would always say somerhing to make you
feel okay.

As one or steianov's closesr friends, javecl witnessed
how benevolent steianov was with others. “We would talk
about relationships with each other," said javed. “He came
across as so compassionate, so sensitive in mat matter It
you didn’t know him, lenko might come across as some.
one who is cold because he is iairly calm and reserved, bur
he's really very emotional."

several ofSrcfznov’s iriends noted char he had a dim.
cult time asking for things, even from those he trusted.
“Lenka wouldn’t just ask for help.” said Mehboob. “He
had such a nioe way of saying things; iihe would ask for
someihing, you oouldnt say no. He would always go around
it though, bear around the bush 1 think irs one oirhe
really positive things abour Lenko_bur it's also really sad. "

He joined the team his sophomore year. In one oi the iirst
opportunities he had to win a 50/50 ball, he made a slide tackle
challenge that leveled one of our All-Conference players irom behind.
l'm pretty sure practice came to a standstill tenko wasn't
intentionally vicious, nor was he trying to make a statement. It was
simply how he played the game: aggressive, hard, not taking any play
for granted. l can’t say i knew Lenka all that well in matters unrelated
to socter. Whatl have learned about him in the last week, though, is
that being aggressive, playing hard and not taking anything for
granted was not just how he played the game, but it was how he lived
every day. I sincerely miss him.

_Jcnny Wood, Physical “million and Men's soccer touch

What i will never iorgct is last year when i sat next to tenko at a
dinner at which Grinnalt college was honoring former Bulgarian
President Petar Stayandv who had mine to Gnnnell a: a German
Marshall Fund Fellow. lcnko was glowing during the entire dinner.
besides the fact that it gave me another opportunity to touch base
with tenko and see how we was doing in his classes and in general, it
was so nice to see him at an event oi this sort.

When I asked him how he was enjoying the m‘sit oi President
Stuyanctv, lenko responded with his wonderiul accent, “i can't believe
that I am having dinner with my president. . .and in Grinnell no less."
What also emerged at that dinner was that Lenko had bnded an
internship at the Federal Reserve Bank In San Francisco. While I knew
that he would love his experience there, I was cgually pleased that he
was going to have an opportunity to spend a summer elsewhere in the
United States and in such an exciting city.

One of the challenges that I and others are probably racing right
now is one oi hindsight. Many oi us are probably wondering ii there
was something we cuuld have done, some indication that Lenko
needed help. I saw him last Friday as l was leaving work late in the
day and, oi course, I have to wonder whether chatting a few more
minutes might have made a difference. Could I have invited him In
our huuse, where perhaps a little time with my kids and dog might
have cheered him up? It is likely that there is nothing that any oi us
could have done to help Lenko, but thinking about the possibility, I
think, is part of still trying in some way to bring him back. I wish we
could. _Jonathan Brand, Lenka’s Tutorial Protessor and

Vice President for Institutional and Budget Planning

his freshman year, he came in to try out (or the soccer team, and
everyone was ternned oi him (myself in particular), because all we
knew ahout him was that his name was lenko Stehnov, he was from
Bulgaria and he loved soccer Speciﬁcally, he loved to play my
position. in his ﬁrst pattice, I remember him slidetackling someone
irom behind and ﬂattening him to prevent him from scoring. That
made quite a iirst impression. oi course, once I got to know him, I
realized what a teddy bear he really was, It must have been so hard
coming in, not only as a ireshman, but also as an international
student, and trying out for a team with a bunch oi guys who already
knew each other and had pbyed together for a few years. But lenko
was always smiling, always working hard, always going to extra
practices to make himseli a better player. 1 also remember the ﬁrst
time he cracked a joke; it caught me so off-guard thatit made me
laugh even harder. He had a great sense oi humor. Those are some
thing: I will always remember about Lenka. It‘s a great loss to the
community, and I will miss him dearly.

Lenko is one oithe nicest people T have known at crinnell. he
originally joined our soccer team in 2001 when l was a sophomore, and
although he was not the best player, he always tried his best. he did it
because he loved soccer and he liked the people who were present when
we played. Lenka was the biggest help to me in classes, though not in
soccer, since I would have to say that his succer knowledge was the
equivalent or my economics knowledge. he helped me out in a few or my
classes and we studied together many times last semester. he was a very
intelligent man and always amazed me with his knowledge and
understanding of the material. {just want tn tell you what he means to
me because it is so diiﬁcult to experience this abroad when you have no
scssions/sennces/etc. to go to and have no opportunity to listen to what
others think.

—Ehrr's Darling '04

In 1999, aiter his iirst attempt to come to Grinnell, lenko was
required to enlist in the Bulgandn military. his government requires all
able—bodied young men oi a certain age to enlist if they are not enrolled
in college; thus, duty called. he would send me emaih about this less
than ideal situation in the military and at times lament about his highly
unmotivated superiors and the horrible iood he had to eat, The
combination of constant physical demands placed upon him and a poor
diet might have helped him to shed sevemt pounds, but more than
anything, his military expedence made him hunger all that much more tor
a good education in the United States. So, when it came time ior the
Scholarship Selection Committee to meet and select that ycais recipient
oithe Eastern European Special Scholarship, ! shared with the committee
my stones oi tenko. Then I pulled out the pictures he sent in with is
application. One of them icaturcd Lenko weanng his soccer uniiorm with
one ioot proudly perched on a soccer ball, and in his eyes you could see a
young man iull oi potential. he also sent us a picture of himself wearing
his military uniiorm, and one particular picture that made all oi us on the
committee laugh. Wearing a short-sleeved shirt and jogging pants, tcnko
was standing in a weight room, surrounded by several freewcights and
other exercise equipment. he struck a pose in which he was flexing his
muscles, as iito prove to the Admission oiiice that this was one healthy
man strong enough to take on the challenges oi Gnnnell college. We all
giggled on the committee.

But it worked! I could not wait to call him personally and give him the
good news.

”Lenka? Are you sitting down? Pack your bags. You’re coming to
Grinnell College." —Eri:Staab, Associate Dean ojAdmr'ssion and

foordl'nator ofIntemaﬁanal Admission

Ithink oi tenko sitting at the family table, where much at our time
was spent with him. he oiten spent some or even all oi a college break
with us, during which he stayed on our third iloor, which is much like a
separate apartment. The ﬁrst day, he would usually zone out, sometimes
emerging only ior iood, and on one occasion he came down bleary-eyed
saying he'd just watched hve mowcs. his time was measured by the
number of Coke cans he had stacked in a pyramid. he would then pursue
those tasks he had prescribed ior himseii: during spring break last year,
he disappeared to the computer lab for hours, teaching himseli
PowerPoint and Excel, which he might use in his :umnler internship in
San Francisco,

his energy, curiosity, perceptiveness about his environment and ability
to integrate all his American cultural experiences and language so quickly
into his persona made him stand out. Though not his real parents, Dan
and 1 were proud oi and always amazed with his successes. Any parent
would be proud of a son with hali his talents and accomplishments. he
will be greatly missed.

—Vi:ki' Bunncll Academic Support Assistant and host mother

[knew tenko as a student in my probability and statistics courses this
year. Lenko's love was economics, so he knew that taking my courses

could he impuﬂant to what he wanted tn do far his life's work, in
the mll, he decided to declare mathematics as a second major. he
told me that he was going to be an economist, but he liked
mathematics very much as well, so wanted to complete the major so
he could ”smell the roses." He was an excellent student in my
course, oiten writing insightiul solutions to tough problems.

The week before his interview in New Vork, he came to me to
explain that he’d miss a Friday class and to ask me ior
”brainteasers." he said that he intenriewers would ask him
brainteasers (l was glad I’d never been on such an interview
before). I didn’t have any brainteasers at my ﬁngertips, but laterl
emailed him some on-line sources. he thanked me for my help,
although, chameteristically, he had abo located some sources on
his own. The next Munday, he saw me beiore class. I asked him how
the interview had gone. He smiled a smile vcny like your photo in
last Fridays Slab and said, "okay; when l arrived home, voicemail
was waiting that told me! had the job." That day I told the class
that tenko's tnp had been successiul, that he had gotten the
internship. He just beamed.

—Thornos Moore, Mathematics

tenko was always very cunous about everything. he would look
in my cupboards and look at my wife's pictures. He saw my wiie's
icons on the bookshcli. He was so happy to see them; they
reminded him of hiring. Another time, he was thirsty and was
dnnking irom our kitchen hucet with his hands, My wife jumped up
out oi the chair and ran to get him a cup. It was just so iunny
seeing Lenko’s expression as my wiie made him drink from a cup.
May Lenko's memory be eternal!
—Tirn dosler, klc

tenko came to Grinnell with one suitcase. he told me he had
everything he needed inside oi him. he was a selirdriven, seli~nlade
man. he was so ambitious he was on ﬁre. You could see that ﬁre in
his eyes sometimes. 1 never saw the dark side of it though. ior irie,
lenko would always be one of the most contagiously enthusiastic,
impulsive, positive and successhil people. 1 ieel though thatthe nre
burnt him, and 1 wish he would have revealed more oi his suiieiing
to me. Maybe I could have helped.

—l7esi Uile/u ’03

lento was a great student who touched me with his enthusiasm
ior the course; in iact, 1 recall being amused by his genuine
utiternent with his work when he handed me the last paper for the
eliss, just days before he died. Lenkc’s suicide was poignant for our
class because it came at the time when we were covering the
material on mental illness. I had chosen to iocus our readings and
discussions on mood disorders because I know that there are many
on campus who suiier from depression. We ended the course With a
deeply felt appreciation ior the pain oi dealing with depression and
the emotional toll that it can exact on those who are depressed, as
well as an thuse whu care for them. Althuugh we were never able to
iinish the materialeto cover the pans about eiiectively treating
depressionAwe were able to learn about the depth oi community
support at Grinnell.

—Laurd sinnett Psychology

Iwill neveriorget his smile and cozy laugh. I will never forget
our moments on the bench. I will never forget our surprise after the
ﬁrst Micm exam. (We did terribly!) And i will never iorget those
dinners on Tuesdays and Thursdays at [Miss during which we
shared our dreams and talked about how much we missed and loved
our families. Gracia: Lenka dc todo torozo'n por tu omistod. Tc vos
