A look into the
invisible world
of snow removal

3v BRADLEY IVERSON'LONG

While most Grinnellians sec snow falling as one of the sights
otwinter, for some at Facilities Management (FM), it is a sign that
there's work to be done.

Michael Bur t, FM's associate director for grounds, lalidscape and
hauling, spearheads FM’s snow removal effort.The task ofcleating
parking lors and walkways usually takes place early in the morning,
while most srudents are sleeping.

“Ifthere’s a pretty high probability that we'll get snow, we scheds
ule an early morning start," said Burt. “Depending on what is pie~
dicted, we vary our start times. I tend to bring in three operators,
and they'll srarr anywhere from midnighr, ifit's a really bad snow, up
to 3 or 4 am. ifit's a really light snow. They run two pickups with
blades [and] a tractor with a front bucket" which clear parking lots
and double-wide sidewalks.

The next step for removing snow is clearing rhe regarlar sidce
walks, which begins anywhere from 3 am. to 5 am. “To do sidee
walks alound campus, we use mowing machines," Burt said. “We
take the front decks off and we put blades on. For a deep snow we
put suov'blowcrs on rhenr, too,"

The final srep in morning prepararions is halldrscoopulg rhc
sidewalks, which can start at around 4 a.m. “ifit’s a big bad snow,"
Burt said, or one to two hours later ifit is lighter. “During the week,
when custodians an: scheduled in buildings, they do a lot of the
snow removal, too." The general rule of thumb is that custodians
manually shovel the 14 feet closest to the buildings in which they
work.

Given rheir morning schedule, late night snowfall is easiest for
FM to spirit away,bur, according to Burt"it's all got to be raken care
of, whether it’s weekday or weekend."

“This winter’s not been bad,” Burt said. “VVe’ve had one big snow
event... but it was during winter break We were able to handle
it prerry well wirhour having ro work around lots ofpcoplc and vee
hlcles."

overall, Burt is fairly satisfied with his wolk.“We don‘t ger a lot
of complaints to our office about our snow removal efforts, and that
to me is a good thing. You don'r get a lor of‘thank yous' or a lor of
‘way to gos’ from the campus community, but if you can avoid rhe
complaints, you know you’re doing pretty good."

Characterizing The
American, Hollywood style

David Harrison wins third prize in Vanity Fair essay contest for
his humorous Hollywood memo on the American character

argument."

American. Here are their
options:

0 A ”rugged, virile" 50-
year-old Reservist with
church-going American
values who dies in M07
sul, Iraq.

Possible leads: Harri-
son Ford, Jeff Bridges.

0 A young inner-city
black man who unex-
pectedly saves invest»
ment bankers from
terrorists and "makes
a cool milin hedge
funds.”

Possible leads: Will
Smith, Chris Rock,

- A female journalist
who works like Rosie
the Riveter in World War
II, uncovers corruption
on the school board
and covers the warin
Baghdad.

Possible leads: Mags
gie Gyllenhaal and Faye
ounaway.

When Vmiily Fm'r editor-at-lnrgc MarrTyrnauer
contacted French professor David Harrison to tell
him that had won third prize in the magazine’s 2004
essay contest, Harrison thought Tyrnauer was trying
to sell him a subscription.

“Then he said,‘You’ve won third prize,"’said Hare
rison.“I thought, you’ve got ro be kidding."

He’d almost forgotten about the entry he’d sub-
mitted in response to the essay's
prompt, which asked Vanity Fair
readers to "explain the character
of the American people to the
rest of the world.”

Harrison drafted his essay,
which he described as a “mock
Hollywood memo," while relax~
ing at the beach in Jacksonville,
Fla. lasr July.

According to Harrison, his
entry demonstrates the “pleasure of frivolity,"but the
memo, in which Hollywood executives debate the
proper protagonist and storyline for their upcoming
“bigrbudgcr epic" Thtﬂmetimn, also exhibits a bite
ing humor toward those writing the memo, as well
as to toward popular conceptions of “the American
character.”

"The point is that its impossible for a Hollywood
storyline to be the American character," said Harris
son. ”How can we define the American character?”

Harrison didn't think he had much of a chance
in the contest because his memo is “not written in
a classic essay format," he said. “There’s not a clear

”The poihlis that it’s impossible
fora Hollywood storyline [0 be the
American character How am we
deﬁne the American character?”
David Harrison, French

However, he thinks that editors’ attention may
have been attracted because, like ”(11in Fair, his entry
deals with Hollywood. Harrison also thinks that the
entry’s “certain sarcasm toward the war in Iraq" might
have appealed to Vﬂittly Fair’s editor Graydon Carter,
the finaljudge of the contest and the author of Wlmz
Wr’w Lori, which criticizes the Bush administration
and the war in Iraq.

The slight irony ofa French pmr
tessor placing in a national contest to
“describe ‘thc American character'"
is also not lost on Harrison. While
his scholarly work did not directly
inﬂuence his entry, Harrison said
that “studying foreign language and
nonrAmerican cultures makes you
more conscious of representations
ofAmerican life. And those are also
the representations students going
abroad deal with."

His decision to answer the contest as he did more
directly reﬂects Harrison's out-of—class interest in
movies. Though he admits to not actually watching
many Houywood blockbusrers, he watches movies
frequently through Netﬂix, and his ofﬁce pmmincnrs
ly displays French and American movie posters.

Harrison described himself as still “shocked and
giddy" about his success in the nation-wide contest,
which drew nearly 4,000 entries. His success also
awards him a 81000 prize and a £175 Monrblanc
StarWalker ﬁne-liner pen.

His essay, “The American Character: A Box-Of-
fice Blockbuster," will appear online at wwwmnnizy
ﬁrimm in March.

a first year, wrote in a statement read by Alex Leach
