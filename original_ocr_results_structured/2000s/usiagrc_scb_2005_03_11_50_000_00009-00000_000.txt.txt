The face of exclusion, hate Trying

Nearly one week after anti-Semitic gi-erriti sninned thc campus
community, everyone in Griimell is talking about racism. 0n the three
and a halfyear anniversary of9/l 1, the Unites Sntes should be discuss-
ing racism and persistent racial profiling. on the one-year anniversary
ofllrM (ll umlza, or March 11), the terrorist train bombings in Mar
dritl by Muslim extiemisr that killed 190 people, Spain has to address
disciiminarion and growing xenophobia as the population becomes ins
creasingly diverse but remains iieoiriproinisingly segregated.

It turns out Spain has kids atter all, they aren’t native Spaniards,
but rather immigrants, a segment otthe population that does not
seem to be included in “todo cl mundo,"thn suddenly faced
with this reality and tin earhil of Eminem 1 could honestly tell
a lieycarold MoroccaneSpaiusli boy at an overcrowded iii-
nerrcity youth center that] really didn‘t have the vocabulary
to translate “The Real Slim Shady"into Spanish for him

He offered to reach me the words in Spanish and Arar
bic ifl taught him in English, but I didn't feel it was the
appropriate venue for that krritl of exchange. But who
knows if I will have airy other opportunity, other than
the Wednesday afternoons at the center, since that's
one ofthe few occasions that I have witnessed people
of different races interacting. EIP/tr‘r, Spain's most pop—
ular newspaper, released an opinion poll in January reporting that for
the ﬁrst time ever, the majority otspaniards think there are too many
foreigners in the country,

Since native Spaniards aren't having their own kids, the country
depends on the rncreasrng inﬂux of immigrants to bolster the econo-
my, yet as immigration increases, so does prejudice. The immigrants,
originating mosLly from Eastern Europe, Northern Africa and Latin
America, now constitute six percent of the population.

They might be saving the pension system from bankruptcy, srimu-
lanng economic growth, expanding the job market by filling lowrpayr
ing positions and boosting the position ofwomcn in the professional
world by caring for their children, but the majority of Spaniards still
blames immigrants for crime and V'mge reduction, according to the
January report. Luckily, the Spanish government has come to realize

what's good for it and has, within the last tew months, adopted a liberal
amnesty policy for illegal immigrants after issuing automatic - en—
ship to the families otthc so immigrant victimswl'lo were killed in rhc
1 1 rM attack.

My host mother, a proud member of‘whar we have dubbed the
“Pius for Franco" ciowd—composed ot just about every deadeaiiimal
clad woman over the age otstvryaxcmplilies a deeply entrenched and

recently emerging \‘cnoplmbla, She advised us when we arrived not
to go to c i an neighborhoods because of the Chinese and Latin
American immigrant populations. Today as we watched the news,
she told me that she gets nervous every time she sees a woman
wearing a “panuclo” (hankerchief; Iicadscai-t) because the Arabs
come to Spain for no other reason than to kill people.

llrM has aggravated alieady prevalent misgivings
about the presence of North Africans, mostly Moroccans,
and like in the United States, has provoked antirlslamie
activity The director of the center recounted an inci-
dent in which a Muslim girl's backpack was taken
from her and tossed back and forth before the staff
intervened. She dismissed the harassment as a result

ofttar that would soon blow over.

Today’s newspaper paper focused on the arrest
otyet another Moroccan suspected to be have been involved in the
bombing, rather than on how Spanish society and race relations have
changed over the last year. Tonight’s news showed tootage ofa solidare
ity march orMoroccan professionals in Madrid showing their solidare
ity with the victims ot last year's attack, Such acts of seltedetense to
counteract unfair stereotyping have been met wrth limited success; the
next story was about Moroccan soccer players on a Spanish team being
heckled and insulted by audience members during the game.

So today, “rodo el mundo" consists of Mott), Achmed, Roccio,
Mo’nicaJiro, Olivia, Oscar, Antonio, Raul and all the other kids at the
center whose names I haven’t memorized yet, the kids at Grinnell who
were subjected to bigotry and to everyone else who has ever felt like the
world would rather do without them,

Take time to understand the reasoning of a non—drinker

The decrsion to add a second substance-free dorm at Grinnell has
engendered a lot ottallc on campus. This has usually in my experience,
revolved around the idea ota freedomeloving student body having their
rights stripped away by moralistic administrators. I disagree vvith thrs
characterization, and am going to take ume away from my
more usual current event subjects to weigh in. I hope this suc-
ceeds 'rn oﬂ‘ering a fresh perspecuve to campus debate,

I don't drinkThis is not a decision I've made because of
some sort of religious dictum, nor is it related to a personal
experience. I've got very ﬁrm reasons for my choice or life-
style.What’s more, in my extremely unscientiﬁc opinion,

I'm not alone in this choice. Drunkenness is usually a
very public start, and is easily noticed, one doesnt
walk into Monday class and exclaim, “Man,I was so
sober over the weekend!” Because drinking is so noa
ticerrble, those who chose to remain sober often are
unnoticed. Nor only are people who choose not to
drink a minority, but they are a comparatively silent
minority—not the most reassuring environment for
that minority

My purpose here is not to attack the majority of Grinnell students
who enjoy alcohol, but to articulate a point of view that doesn't get artic-
ulated enough. Like everyone,I iirmly believe that my choice oflifcstylc
is intrinsically superior to everyone else’s, with regards to drinking, taste
in music, academic interest and everything else under the sunThat test
ing of moral superiority doesn’t give me the right to condemn other
people’s choices, butI do have the right to explain my point of view.

The reason thatI choose not to drink has to do with my own pets
ception of my selfrworth. Of all my various human traits, the most im

Let’s talk about race

DAVID MONTGOMERY

portant to me are my intelligence and my selt-centrol. 1 am a rational
human being with the ability to choose what 1 do and what I don't do,
Alcohol and other mind-altering chcmieals threaten who I am.
Because of my choice of lifestyle, I’ve achieved a sort of indepen-
dence rhatI love, Ifl want to relax after a grueling weelcl do so on my
own tenns, without the necessity for a foreign chemical to change my
mental state. Whatever I do on Friday nighr,I do because I chose to
in a competent state ofmind. I’m not interested in escaping reality by
dragging my brain into submission.
I could be the only person on campus who feels this way That
wouldn't be all bad, because I'm naturally contrary and enjoy argue
\ ing, But I suspect that I’m not alone.There are others who want
‘ to live in an environment that doesn’t constantly imply their
own aberrance.

That's why I support more substancerfree
housing. I don’t know ifI’ll try to live there next
year, but I like the option. If] don’t, my lifestyle
isn't going to change because 1 live in close prox-
imity to people with a diﬁ‘crent lifestyle, That's

because I've made up my mind about what kind of life I want to lead
now, Of course, as opponents of substancerfree housing often point out,
college is a time for experimentation. Many people come to Grinnell
open to new ways ofliving, and the inﬂuences they receive during their
ﬁrst year at collcgc could shape their life With the majority ofsrudents
at Grinncll choosing to drink, role models for a different lifestyle are
scattered throughout the campus. Substancerfree housing sends a posi-
tive message to everyone who chooses to break the mold.

1 do welcome the comments oteveryoue who reels strongly about
what I've said here one way or another.

Scientists Should know better

Students speak

on their minds in
1-42 words or less,
and you’re invited!
If you have a rant,

email it to

After all, come
plaining in a pub
lic forum is always

more fun than

doing it alone

QWhat does it take to mobilize lots of students raced
as white who have strong feelings about an issue on campus
wherein they feel their rights are violated?

A: A demonsuadon against -.r proposed smoking ban in
front of Nollen house.

Some of my good friends are smokers There are
smokers in my family. I tried smoking, it wasn't really my
thing, butI respect you ifyou smoke andI diinkyou’ve got
cveiy right to topics yourself in public. Hey, I was there
with you in front ofNollen house that day, because I like to
consider myself an ally to the srnolo‘ng community.

Dear Snidcnrs Against Grinnell Apathy, having dear
onstrated that you care passionately about issues concern-
ing student’s rights and stlf-govemance as you did last sc-
mester in the well organized smoking ban protest, Grinncll
Students for Sinctr-ity would like to see you at open forums
about race. In dialogue concem'rng hate crimes,we'd like to
set you actively involved. I’m sure you agree--tlierc is no
place for apathy surrounding these issues.

Your friend and ally,

I’ve ﬁnally realized why 1 am perpenially late to
my class iu Noyce; every clock in the building is four
nrinutes fast. Is this a psychological experiment der
signed to make everyone walking from ARH stressed
and unions? Is it some sort of time warp created by
the physics department? Or is it just a trick so that
you scie tisrs can snicker at all of us perpetually late
Human es majors? You know, I would expect an
entire building full of SCIENTISTS to be able to
scrape together enough technological know»how to
make their clocks work correctly. Whatever the hell is
going oti, it needs to stop ght now. This isn't Central
Standard Time, it's EST; Bull Shit Time.

to reach
prospies

Last week, I sat down
at Microsoft Word to write
an article and make some
money. 1 necdcd to write
about campus life with hue
morous insight. I needed
to write about ups and
downs, the ins and outs
of my own personal
experience as a Grins
nell College student.

But I did not need

to write a column for

the SﬂfB—it was my week off. Instead,I had thrown
mysclt out of the frying pan of student body scrutiny
and into the frre of the outside world, which is cold,
anonymous and has not yet bought a Nalgenc from the
bookstore. 1 was writing for prospective students

Any English major worth her salt and a degree in
reading novels knows that audience is an important
thing to consider. She also knows that language is a
way to affect another person, from its use in political
discourse to its use on the professorwho is reading her
paper on political discourse. When you are a day over
deadline and have two other papers due, however, these
concerns turn into afterthoughts to write about in your
next week’s SSE column.

How, then, are you supposed to go about exercising
your right to word of mouth? What do prospective
students get to know? How do you tell drem? And
why are their prospects at Grinnell really that great?
or, as my brutally honest, radically inclined friend
asked me as I complained about my assignment, “Isn’t
that like selling out?"

My nuanced answer to that question is, no, not re-
ally. Prospies are less easy to get to in print than they
are, say, at Harris, or chatting at arable during their
ﬁrst dining hall experience, but just because you can’t
really touch them doesn’t mean you shouldn't try. If
incoming freshmen belong to the “petting zoo" their
ﬁrst semester, prospies are an even more distant species,
something that requires special lighting and a ﬁberglass
wall The rat or one newsletter skips right past waiting
for the prospie and parents to move their trays off the
juice bar. You don’t have to answer any questions about
class mtio, or how to score drugs, sex or good grades. If
the world is Grinoell, then the world is also your soap
box, Say what you willithere is more space between
tour guide and tourist than meets the eye. just don’t
make faces through the window; that is mean and they
never react the way you want them to.

Regardless of my prospective publication moraliae
ing, as the weather warms up, an inﬂux of high school
seniors will also brighten the campus landscape. The
student body might think that the future Lies in spring
break, but the administration knows it lies in Accepted
Students Weekend. My future includes a paycheck for
an article about the writing on the Hurling bathroom
walls. Maybe this is where college recruitment and col—
lege reality overlap: like any good prospective snident,1
still have my eyes open for opportunity

Thanks Brother Ali!

Real hip hop in Grinnell, ...a rare sight. or
should I really consider that ass-grindin shit at
most harris parties “music“. Been there ahead all
I wanna do in this rant is express my appreciation
for what went down last weekend. Some sun and
warmth brought to us by...ironical.ly an Albino trorn
MinneapolisThanks Brother Ali!
