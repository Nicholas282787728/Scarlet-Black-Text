‘A generous heart’

The Greater Austin YWCA names Melina Rivera '07 a "Young Woman of
Achievement" for dedicated volunteer work with community organizations

By BEN Kluc

Melina Rivera ‘07 leads a double life. As an activist, that
is. In Grinnell, Rivera is currently Vice President of the Stun
dent Organization of Latinos/as (SOL); in her hometown of
Austin, Texas, she is a committed eommunrty organizer and
advocate for the Latino population.

Her contributions back home are so valued that she re
cently won the 2004 "Young Woman ofAchicvement" award
from the YWCA ofGreater AustinThe award is one of eight
”VVomen oi' the Year Awards" given by the Austin YWCA to
women who exemplify its "mission ofempowering women and
girls and eliminating racism," according to the YWCA’s wehe
site. Other categories recognize signiﬁcant contributors to the
arts, education, science/technology and other
ﬁelds.

In high school, Rivera was involved in reg-
rsterrng mrnority voters. She would go doors
to—door in Austin‘s predominantly Latino
and African-American neighborhoods, which
tended to have low voter turnout, espeerally in
local elections.

She noticed the older African Americans
she met were usually very dedicated vote
ers. They had gone through the Civil Rights
Movement and were aware ofthe impact they
could have on their government by speaking
out, Rivera said. Younger African Americans
and Latinos, who had never had the experi-
ence ofaehieving such great social change as a
group, tended to be less frequent Voters.

Promoting a different sort of political
engagement, Rivera put a lot of time into 131
Concilio, one of the best-known neighbor
hood associations in Austin. She helped the
organization address issues that affected its
mostleratino constituency through meet»
lugs with the city council as well as in protests
and rallies. “They got lots of media attention,"
Rivera said, since the gatherings sometimes
drew as many as 100 people, including many
students.

issue Rivera helped the group tackle. "There were high con»
taminant levels in the air," she said, “[but] people were under
the impression that the power plant served the community
Actually, it was for buildings downtown."

Rivera and her high-school friends also produced a radio
show that focused on “political issues affecting the community
as a whole,m she said,

Rivera sees no problem in the fact that she was younger
than many community members who she was collaborating
with to address these issues. “We're very different generations,
but we’re fighting for a common cause,”she said.

one organization Rivera was involved with, called Souths
wcsr Key, docs deal solely with youth issues, however, It is a
nonproﬁt that works with kids whom the just
rice system labels “juvenile delinquents,"grving
these kids “opportunities and alternatives to
going to a penitentiary," Rivera said. Southwest
Key nominated Rivera for the Y\NCA award.

New Vice president of the Student Orga-
nization of Latinos/as (SOL), Rivera said the
“goal this year is to promote awareness” ofLa-
tino issues on campus. SOL plans on bringing a
speaker to campus and is contributing films to
this month's multicultural film festival, which
“was an idea that originated with SOL but ex-
panded to other organizations on campus."

SOL’s ﬁlms come from Cine Las Americas,
a nonproﬁt media organization Rivera worked
with that brings independent Latin American
ﬁlms to the US

Suzette Gum. a multicultural counselor for
Student Affairs, is thrilled that Rivera won the
YWCA award. “I think she’s a very deserving
person with a very generous heart,"Gurn said.

Rivera, before heading off to a debate be
tween local political candidates, offered basic
but important advice for her fellow socially»
conscious Grlnnellians. While one person has
the power to make a difference, she said, united
we can achieve much more: “Una persona pu~
eda set una difereneia, pero unidos podernos
lograr mucho mas."
