Over-dependence?

With the endowment contributing 60 percent of the annual budget, the Treasurer, the President and the
Trustees try to create a more ”balanced” revenue stream

None of them seemed nervous. not
President Russell Osgood, not Treasurer
David Clay, not VicesPrcsidcnt for Insti-
tution and Budget Planning Jonathan
Brand. But a racer orrhc college’s spend.
ing pattern has them, and the Trustees
who oversee their work, a little worried.

“At other well endowed colleges, the
endowmenrcontrihutes 30 ro 40 percent
[or the annual budget]. but Grinncll
Collcg:'x eonrribures so percent,"
Osgood said. “Let's soy we have a sus.
tained market contraction. . . What do
we do at that point?"

The Trustees calculate the endows
merit contribution to the general budget
in such n wny to diminish the effects of

Students are involved in the budgeting
process. The budget is recommended to
the president by a budget committee. (The
president then recommends rt to the
Board of Trustees.) The committee was
established in 1991, and since that time,
the president has not altered the
committee's recommendation in any way.
Two students serve on the committee, One
is a voting member and the other is an
alternate. The alternate generally becomes
the voting member the next year, The
students are recommended to the
president by the student government,

Carleton College:

The Budget Committee is a standing
subcommittee of the College Council. Its
membership consist: of the Dean for
Budget and Planning as chair, one faculty
member and one student member of the
Council, one faculty member elected by
the faculty for a three-year term or
service, one student nominated by [SA
Senate, and such other members of the
community as determined by the three
Presidents. The Budget Committee

Kenyon College:

Kenyon‘s students set the Student Attivlties
Fee, which is part of the overall budget,
through Student Countll. That's their only
direct involvement; they can exercise
indirect influence through the Ofﬁce of
Student Arrairs and through their meetings
with trustee committees.

SWARTHMORE
mm

students are involved in Swarthmore‘s
budget process in two ways,

rrrsi, four students serve as rull members or
the College Budget Committee, which
establishes the budget each year.

Second, there's an organiaation called the
Student Budget commrttee (something
separate hom the college Budget
Committee) that determines rundrng tor
student activities throughout the year.
Representatives at this committee romc
bernre the College Budget committee each
year to recommend the size or the annual
student activity roe pard by all students
with their tuition, room & board, etc.

we would rhen lay on faculty to pay for
rhnr ﬁnancial aid. The solution he and
claysce is a gradual turn to a more “bal-
anced" inﬂow orresourees, "we need to
see other revenue sources grow," Clay
said, “while also making sure that we
spend our money well."

In more solid terms, that “balanced"
now may mean rnerensed tuition, more
fulhpay students, and a greater push for
fundraising. '

. “[Grinnell is] one or a only a tew
schools that's both needbirnd and meets
trill demonstrered need," clay said. “I
hope we're always like thar, but to do that
we need some students who pay [full Eu»

Student input/involvement in the budget
process ror Washington and Lee is rather
limited. Students are rully responsible tor
developing rationale and
recommendations relative to the level or
our Student Attivity Fee. Beyond that,
students have no direct student
involvement in the budget process.
Students’ involvement is usually limited
to things like supporting new
departmental initiatives. There are no
tormal steps where students are involved;
however, the administration welcomes
their input on ad hot issues. The Dean of
Students attempts to solicit student
thoughts as he builds his area budget
eath year, but he is the only person in an
executive level position who seeks out
students in the process.
