Howard for most roles as a
ereepy older guy).

B: Not a Daniel Clowes comic book He's won 10
Harvey Awards (comic books’ osears). A remnanr orrhe
book is the crisp visual style of the movie. Enid's colorful
wardrobe and blaek glasses go well with her pale complex-
ion, Birch is tailor made for this part,

1: l rorally agree. Enid’s chamerer is eomplerely punked
our, and this really shows her idenriry snuggle. i would go
“rrendy punk" ifl were a rebellious lseymreold wirlrour a
job or rollege, with a besr friend who was considering
moving away, and a father who wanted to kick me our of
the house because hey, that is the only solution. Seri-
