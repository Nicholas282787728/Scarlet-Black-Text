Vikings,Bears,Packers OH MY!

We have survived the gruesome trek ucioss
the sports desert that is the summer montllsi

Vikings winning the super Bowl. That’s right,
you heard it here first,or you heard it from Dr,

still reading a sports medium tlint is ns rclelmnt
as the 46 defense.

The Vikings have come so close to wine
ning a championship in the 40‘plus years of
their existence, only to see them take a dump
in the Super Bowl (or before) that would diST
gust even osi Umenyiora Regardless Mina

down on QB Tarvaris Jackson now, but mark
my words, by the end of this year he will be
a top-15 quarterback that will lead (his team

order to rationalize the insane amount ofoptir

The team has ndded ten nciv pinyers to
its sou-id as well as keeping its entire stnrtr

unique position to be able to use up to
19 players during nny given march. “I re-

just like last year. is the New England Patriots.

I save my last prediction for my most
hated enemy, the Green Bny Packers. Their
young and talented defense should keep them
in most games, but i am skeptical 1bout the
stirying power of Ryan Grant, and think their

conhdenee in Anron Rodgers is sorely niis-
placed. He doesn't have the skill set to become
