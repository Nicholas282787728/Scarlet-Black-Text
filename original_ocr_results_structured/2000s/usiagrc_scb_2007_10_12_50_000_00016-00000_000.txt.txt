He told us to sit naturally anti just coir
tinuc our discussion. Somehow with cameras
pointing at our unnatural scatin rangcmcnt,
convcr. rion did not ﬂow as ea ly, Insrdc the
whale room, two of us sat at a small table by
the window

“Just pretend you're having a conversation,"
he instructed,

Brit before we
mo Ad from our
original table to
the whale room we
had been talking
about our, classes
and weekend plans.
Now it was dlffl’
cult to siinrilate that same conversation. So, we
took on characters that would be immortalized
in photographs. I playcd a rcmalc Grruucllian
in love with a malt: strrdcntTragically, my bcst
friend had just broken up with said malc, crcs
atrng an obstacle to true love. I wonder if the
photographer captured the sexual tension of
the scene.

Last week, photographers wandered
aro rd the JRC asking students to change p
sirions, to sit a certain way in the Grill: chairs
or to simply move out ofrhe way so that phos
tographets could get their shots. The photogr
rapheis were unknown to me, but I cooperated
and was in several of the spontaneous photo
shoots around the JRC. Every trmc l sporrcd
the longhaircd man with .1 Freddie Mercury
mustache and grungy trucker hat I thought,
“Here is my opportunity to be in a Grinnell
magazine or a college view book." I thought
salt-importantly that Freddie lVIercui'y must
have pickcd me for a rcasonl

In [lit Grille, the (rut; ‘l' hat man asked if
it was okay if he took a picture ora {mud and
me. We agreed and continued to wait for out
paninis. When our names were called to get
our dinner, we looked in the direction of the
cameraman to ask if it was okay ifwc got up,
He gave us pcrmission and lifted his hcad from
the camera while we settled ourselves again in
the shot.W hen we spotted someone we knew,

we glanced in the direction of the ' meta for
approval ofa new person in the picture. How

was the focus ofthe
photos.

I figured
Grinnell had hired
photographers to
ﬁnd students do

, irrg Grinnell things
and photograph us
doing them in hot

rrbly unnatural ways. Bur i was corrected while
standing in litre at the Grille a few days later.
I was loudly and irrevcrciitly chatting about
how my fricnd and l werc chosen to he photos
graphcd in the whale room hccausc we were a
diverse breakfast table (read: a girl with a nose
ring, a tall blonde girl, and a black Jew with
dreads). As i joked, a woman in a suit and a
nametag explained that the photographer was
not working for Grinnell to immortalize m:
in a View book but instead was hired by the
architect ofthc Joe Roscnfrcld Center,

After learning this, I realized I was not the
focus ofany ofthese pictures. In most pictures
thc props highlight the people in them, but I
was supply a prop in a photo or the building
around mc. I imagined the architect looking at
photos ofmc as an anonymous student loungr
mg m hrs comfortable grccn mesh chair. He
mrghr reminisce about the day he envisioned
this building made ofw‘rndows, matching ﬁn-
niturc of primary colors and electronic display
screens [lashing the darc and time. He might
applaud himsclfat thc strrking rcscmblancc or
the whale room to the actual inside ofa whale
or at his rnrtral embargo on clocks, I worr
dared if he would scan through the photos of
his mastcrprcca and sac that one girl with a
nose ring and large crpcctant eyes and see that
she commanded the spotlight like no chair or
doorway ever could.

Modern pioneers lose innovative spirit

The Board ofTiustees is charged with the
stewardship otthc college's assets and thc ob»
ligation to carry our school through the years
equipped to train the minds ofthc next gener
ation. To the members ofthc board is entrusr
ed the task of captarnrng our ship, deciding its
direction, course and destination and avoiding
those hazards inherent in uncharted waters.

nut wc do not go forward without a grcat
advantagc. Relatrvc to the size ofrhc combined
student and faculty hotly, our endowment is
considerable, No
other college of
similar enrollment
has near our pus-
session of wealth.
Yer dcspitc the re
sources at hand,thc
trustees responsible
for commanding them are hesitant to use our
greatest strength. Over—dependent on our en-
dowment, they are content not to step conti-
dcntly into uncertainty and instcad to follow
fashions designed by our poor institutions. But
this rs counter to our collccrivc experience.

The growth of our endowment can be
readily attributed to the ingenuity of several
distinguished alumni, chictamong them Rob-
crt Noyce, coefounder of Intel. The college
invested in the early phases of that historic
project and profrtctl immensely from the com-
pany's growth. Yet that growth was possible
only because of the courage ofNoycc and his
peers. Conﬁdent in their knowledge and skill,
they crcatcd a marketwhich did not exist, gcn-
crating a demand whcrc previously thcrc had

Zach Razavi '08

been only a dream of a device as versatile as
the semiconductor. Following the tradition of
the Corrgrcgatronalrsts who founded rhc lowa
College ovcr a century before, Noyce pioneer-ed
new oppor lunlties and, like those first pioneers,
he established a legacy ofsrrccess and achrcvo
merit which is now entrusted to our board. 1 lis
boldness and ingenuity should in uc us to
hlazc new routes, Bur thi not so.
Recently, our trusrc hint. hccn inclined
to look to our pcci' tutions rnr uitlrnce
and examp c, They
cite the llccd to
conform to in»
dustty practices to
maintain competi-
tiveness \vrtll othcr
schools in our vein
of liberalism. But
how do we drstingursh ourselves by appearing
more like our competitors? What tradition do
the trustees follow or create when they appeal
to the precedent of out pecti . nations as an
admirable course for progress> As other col-
leges move forward with expanded programs
in social justice, even though thcy don't have
the stability of immense resources, why do we
use the threat of the endowment’s Impermnr
nence to deny funding to progressive and pier
nearing projects, community service congruent
with our morals and our legacy?
lfrhc trustees are made rirnrd by rho risks
of a less conservative frnancial phrlosophy,
then they should also be timid about hoards
ing this wealth. They are not doing this college
any favors if they keep all asset this ﬂexible

and strong too close to our chest.The Clid0\\'*
ment is not a lifeboat which should be used
only when ncccssary. It is a sail that turns op-
portrrnity rrrtn p hrs and propels Grinnell
further along our way This r tundamcnral
dift‘erence in perspective; do we use the tool
something broken or to brrrld something
new: Culrenlly, we favor the s ‘llllty of the
inrrncr to the uncertainty of the ter, but we

campus would bcrreiit from great resources,
especially those humanitarian pursuits in the
community Service Ce r and the Chaps
lain’s otficc, whose underfunded programs are
forced to ﬁnd resources iir other venues like
SGA, which detracts from that organization’s
ability to uphold its prior commitments.

By moving into the future with conﬁdence
and by embracing the groundbreaking sp
which has served this college throughout its
life, we modem pioneers might add our own
milestones to those of out progenitors. We
must not deny ourselves the advantage of out
cndowrnanWc must have the conﬁdciicc to
pursue novcl policies, to create our own wakc
which attracts others to it. To be wealthy is to
have the luxury to make mistakes. But. at the
present time, Grinncll is making the mistake
or irracriorr.Tlrcy arc mistakes from which we
cannot lcaru,Thcy cstablish a precedent that
discourages the visionary aspirations with
which we arc endowed. And they openly ig-
nore the true lesson of Noyce: that the future
belongs to those who make it.
