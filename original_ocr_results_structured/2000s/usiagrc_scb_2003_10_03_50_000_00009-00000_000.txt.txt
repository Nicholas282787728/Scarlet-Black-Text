Swashbuckiers, psyChOS, students and (yet again) a French movie at Harris this weekend

by Bradley Iverson-Long and Kay Nguyen
Bmdley: Neversay this column is good for nothing. Thanks to my
curring jab, boastful 5&3 columnist Elisa “L. Lenssen is iiow once
mot: mild-mannered Elisa “ " LensScn. Chang: is good, but I'm not
going to retract my hyphenated last name anytime soon. Now for the
movies.

Pirates of the Caribbean (PG-13)

B: Pirates are an oft»0pp|‘essed minority group that hasn’t gotten
dicir r. r represennirion in modern sociery. Thankfully, Disney, who also
has promoted the repressed euliure otralking roys, mice, fish and geniee,
has created this oduoirional movie to show us rhe traditions oipirare
folk Our heroes are i band of pirates led by captain Barbossa (Geolrrey
Rush) who capture soecei.player.rurned-socierahplayer Ellubcth Swami
(Keiia Knightly). Their pirate way otlife is under attack by a blacksmith
apprentice (orlnndo Bloom). and a drunk sailor (a brilliantly drunk
Johnny DcpP). And by the notorious British pirate haters

Kay: To see Johnny Depp in eye shadow and shredded clothing,
drinking, cursing and singing in draaavvling pirate parois is definitely
refreshing, considering how deadly erotic he was in Don/iron r/e Marco
and The Ninth Gore. Aighh, but Legolas wirhour the platinum siream or
hair and archery fears complcrely derchurmed me. And he's rescuing his
princess, how sadl The fair lady Knightly dosnt bend it like Beckham
anymore, instead she bows, ine dances and she scuba dives (well iumps
the plank).

The soundtrack is awesome, Like any wholesome Disney treat, the
movie engages both auditory and visual senses, which is a delight for
parents or hypcreerive kids, so it doesn't matter there is an occasional
splash ofMummy thrill or 51'»an humor.

B: Agreed, see this movie not only because ir has pirates. bur
because it has undead skeleton pirates played by Geoffrey Rush, among
others. I think more Academy Award winning actors should rake on
such challenging parts.

A bit of business (sincel know you all are going to see more oft/I!
Cmibbmn tonight): the evening showing will be at 8:50, nor 7:30. due
to a dorm dediration ceremony, which l'm sure will not have any
pirates, drunk or undead.

L’ Homme du Train
The Man on the Train (R)_

K- Here is some fodder for your pholosopliy class discussion well, if
you ever rake 293: Ethic issues in senior citizen culture lrs quite a
cooldown for a Saturday arrernoon, when your Friday night fmlrzy is
over, your yoga session is srill fresh and your mind hasn’t yer been able
to tune from 0m to Obladi, Oblada.

okay, two men in the iwilighi ofrheir lives meet by chance and

share their stories. one of these elderly gentlemen is a bankerobbei
in town to do one last job and the other is a rerired poetry reaeher
with a drugstor: and a messedup love lite. The Story rakes place in a
sleepy town occasiomllysrirred up by the passing ora train, where
everything is predictable everybody is bored and almost no one is
happy about ir. Thanks to the excellent acting oriolinny Halliday
and Jean Rocherorr, rhe movie didnrsend me into a coma after 10
minures l ean conﬂdcntl ly recommend this thought provoking pieoe
to those interested in pondering the melancholy assoeiared ivirh
missed opportunities and the long—lost past.

Psycho (R)

K: For rhe first time i find myself preferring a Norris shower stall
[0 a Loose bathtub, This Iiorroi- classie's bathtub is disturbing!
Minimal gore guaranteed, as many God-fonring maneloviiig directors
oFthe 60s assured you. However it's nor much era eonsoIarion
when it comes (0 Hitchcock, who can rerriry wiihout employing
gore. Sweet little Marion gets bored, runs away to her law: with some
illegonun money, stops by a motel, meets ihe iimid ownerivith a
domineering mom, gets murdered, You're going to ask: love, sex,
greed, Sigmund Freud or just run.> You're psycho, manl Check it out!

With Honors (PG-13)

a: Brendan Fraser somehow is a rop student at Harvard, bur has
to learn a life lesson from Joe poser, a bum who wanrs to burn his
arm paper. Well hey, rhose other three movies all look good.

Elisa “ " Lenssen: Heartwarming as ir is to have Bradley here
looking our for my mildrmannuodncxs, Watching or thinking about
Lyn/i Home retrigeiares :lny warm feeling, I like that Madonna
wrote asong for this film. I also like rIiar this song is dried “I‘ll
Remember" yer rhe mayoriey orrhe populous has done its best ro
forget [his movie. wirh Brendan Fraser, I’m only ever convinced ot
one thing one mans hair and voeal proieerion can indeed coexist in
the same perpenial muddle. Perpetually piiddling around rhis movie
is watery sugary syrupy sap. It rains a lot onscreen. But ifyou like
viewing improbable oollege residential environmenis and Joe Pesci in
monochromatic oiirhis, dien you might like with Honro, With a
mild sedarive.

Cultural Film
Russian Ark (NR)

B: A bizarre concept: an entire movie ﬁlmed in one shot, about
the entirety of Russian history.

Pretty Girls Make Graves

Cobra High and S PRCSS
Fri., 0d A.
Gardiner Lounge

Pretty Girls Make Graves may be the kind of name
hands wish they had, and some music lovers ﬁnd
themselves a little curious about, And indeed, they are a
curious quintet, playing emotionally intense punk rock.
The hand hails from Seattle—you can ﬁnd them in
Gardner Lounge this Saturday, screaming, singing, and
pouring out their souls, all at the same time.

Pretty Girl: Make Graves embodies the intersection
between beautiful women and gloomier themes, A lovely
young woman, Andrea Zollo, sings lead and four male
band mates Support heron guitars, drums, and bass. All
the band members have done time in bands with equally
sinister names like Murder City Devils and Death Wish
Kids. The group teens with punk experience. Having
spent a little over two years together and even longer In
the Seattle punk stone, the ensemble has ﬁgured out
what they like and how to do it, This results in
energeti£_rock music that is gripping and dance-worthy,

It is a blend that isjust raw enough—scatchy,
proﬁcient guihirs accompany vocals thét go from
controlled to (razy with expert speed on songs like Sad
Girb Par Vida. Zollo opts for all-out shrieking on other
songs like Head Souths Add to this emotional musical
energy a careful attention to lyrics, and you have a band
who knows their genre and their material. As Zolla'sings
on "Speakers Push Air”, Pretty Girl: Make Graves wants us
to “remember what the music meant.”

Also playing on Saturday night are rohra High and s
PRCSS. Calm High also originate from the Seattle music
scene, with an energy much like that of the headliner:
This all-male lineup, however, also incorporates
synthesizers into their music, 5 PRCSS, the other opening
act, unlike their tour mates, have lived in a number of ’
states. Also, at least 11 different bass players have
passed through their ranks. This group incorporates
more pop-inspired sounds than their tour mates do, but
they focus just as directly on their lyrics and sound. A;
vocalist and guitar player iloli note said "We sound a lot
like Britney Spears it, instead of dating Justin and being
lusted after by millions, she spent her youth having sex
with incompetent emo boys,” Curiosity might bring 3 lug
crowd to Gardiner on Saturday night. and a hill night of
punk rock might just keep them there.
