Obama and Oprah

BYJAMES ANTHOFER

What constitutes the appeal of Oprah Winfley? I see her
as a sometimes paradoxical and ambiguous character, contain~
ing the contrasting ideas of truly American consumption (free
ens, nice clothes) and serious progressive principals in love of
philanthropy, the Book Club),

In the Hqu Auditorium in Des Moines, replete with
full band, a giant Christmasdighttd “Iowa for Obama" sign
and 18,000 cheering attendees, Winfrey brought her full Coll’
n-adictory presence to bear in an equally incongruous setting.
We normally experience \Ninfrey on television, sitting on her
couch 10 feet away and talking to us directly while cncing up
inspirational videos from time to time, On stage, she was a dise
tant charactei surrounded by a huge auditorium.

Two chairs and a podium were the only objects on the stage,
the chairs being where Michelle Obama and \Ninfrey sat after
they had made their respective speeches so that they could stay
on stage during Batack Obama’s speech.

' that vast plain,

in front of that teeming mass, facing the cameras across that

sea of people, but Michelle Obama made the best of it with

a quick speech praising Winfrey's “leadership that can touch
our souls",

Somehow, though, I don’t think that much ofunything Mir
chelle could have said would have added or detracted from the
sometimes strange, other times utterly powerful endorsement
of the other woman in the event.

Winfrey never was completely convincing as a political fig»

ure. Someone who shows how “tired of politicians" she is by
merely not inviting many of them onto her show over the years
seemed remarkably unaware other position when asserting that
in “dangerous times, we‘re all trying to watch American Idol to
forget about it."

Winfrey wanted the audience to trust her to continually get
beyond the “political veil" (which she maintains Obama tran-
scends), and I have to admit that hearing from her that Obama
“has an ear for eloquence and a tongue dipped in unvnrnished
truth" was at least more entertaining, if not necessarily more
revelatory, than a typical staid endorsement based on the “facts"
and "policy,"

I couldn't believe, however, that in the celebrity circle that
she mentions, where she “discusses" the “dangerous" issues of
today, she would dare to admit that she “has voted for as many

Pres. Clinton defends wife as “change agent”

nth/Lllt BOTTLES

Former President Bill Clinton’s voice teverbetated through
out Grinnell College’s Darby Gym on Monday as he spoke
on behalf of his wife Senator Hillary Clinton before a crowd
packed onto the wooden bleachers that normally hold passions
ate basketball fans

Between 1,200 and 1,500 people attended the speech, in-
eluding both dedicated supporters of sen Clinton and unde-
cided voters just hoping to see and hear the former president
himself. Before the speech,Josh Weber'09 said,“I kind ofwant
to see Bill Clinton and maybe hear about some of the other
Clinton's policies.“

After close to 15 minutes of talking about problems faced
by the world,Webcr ﬁnally got his second wish as Pres. Clinton
began making the ease for why his wife should be elected presie
dent. Speaking without notes, Pres. Clinton argued that Sen.
Clinton is a “change agent" with examples from her life from
before the two married to the present day.

Pres. Clinton’s argument was that his wife has been this
“change agent” her entire life, and as a result of that life as a

reformer is uniquely qualiﬁed to put that change into action.

As a senator, Pres. Clinton argued, “she gets things done,"
reminding the audience of her success with pushing through
legislation regarding carbon emissions and improvements to
veterans’ health care,

The president refrained from cri 'eizing sen. Barack
Obama or any of Sen. Clinton's other rivals for the Democratic
nomination, focusing instead on praising his wife.

In concluding his address to the Grinnell community, Pres.
Clinton simply said, “I’m telling you, in 40 years, she’s the best
person I've had the chance to vote for for president."

Republican Debate fails to bring out the claws

EYJEFF RADERSTRONG

on Wednesday, the D2: Molnct Region Republican Presir
dential Debate opened with the statistic that six in 10 Iowa
voters could be persuaded to choose a different candidate than
their current choice. This statistic might make it seem like the
nine candidates present at the last debate before the Iowa cau-
cuses would do all they could to draw sharp contrasts with each
other and to attack rivals’ candidacies.

But this ms not the case. The
personal attacks common during po~
litical crunch time were not prom‘r
nent Wednesday afternoon, and those
wanting to see it on stage might have
to wait until Democrats get involved
The debate, which lasted more than 80
minutes, remained relatively civil and
clean.

Of course, there were still occasional lapses into unfriendly
territory, but not involving the “usual suspects.” Many thought
Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas and new
Iowa frontrunner, would be attacked from all sides, But he was

mostly spared,

The largest tension came between Mitt Romney, former
governor orMassachusetts and tronrrunner in lowa up until a
tow weeks ago, and tormer senator Fred Thompson, who also
works as a television and movie actor.

In one instance,Thompson quipped to Romney that he was
“getting to be a pretty good actor."

To which Romney
“Takes one to know one."
_ Huckabee did take the occasional
hit. Romney said that he did a betterjob
on education as a governor than Huckaa
bee, and chri‘om Tancrado questioned
the Arkansas governor’s immigration
policies.

Both Romney and former Mayor
Rudy Giuliani, the current leader in national polls, took a hit
for their stances on abortion. Romney defended his recent con,
version to the prorlife cause, saying he would “not apologize for
being prevlife.” Giuliani said he was against abortion persons
ally, but supported prorehoice policies and will not change

responded,

The format of the debate helped create its general lack of
aggression. Most of the questions were asked to all of the can-
didates and each received the same amount of time to respond.
Interspersed throughout the whole event were “free statements"
from each candidate,in which they had 30 seconds to say what
ever they wanted. There were also periodic showings otprerrer
corded interviews with each candidate, except former Ambase
sador Alan Keyes.

The moderator, Carolyn Washburn of the D2: Mm'm: Rage
om, mostly kept the candidates in line and to the time restric-
tions. These were tight and she sometimes asked for only 15
second answers.Washburn did lose control of the debate at one
moment, when she asked for a show ofhands on who believed
global warming was an important issue facing the country. The
candidates refused to comply and insisted on being given time
to explain their stances, forcing Washburn to back down.

Washburn opened the debate saying that she would not
focus so much on the major issues, like the war in Iraq, but
emphasize policies Iowans cared about, Most of the questions
dealt with the economy, some with respect to job creation and
