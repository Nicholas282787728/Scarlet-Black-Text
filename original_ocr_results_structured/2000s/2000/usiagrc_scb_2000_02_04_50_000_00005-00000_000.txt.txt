side rhe “safe" eonnrres ofa ehureh. Sur-
prisingly enough, borh rhese aers have a
poinr. Each everrr is rho poirrr in a man's
life where rheir inneeenee is rahen away.
By rhe and or rlre seeond ehaprer, Ellioy
has lnrre'drreed his reader ro rhe main share
aerers or rhe book and hinred ar rheir re.
speerlve nrorrvarions behind rheir aerrons.

In Blood 011 II]: M0012, Ellroy ereares a
deeply ﬂawed proragonrsr who rhe reader
may or may nor lilre, bur ﬁlls rhe “good
guy" role orrhe novel. All rhings Consid-
ered, Der. sgr. Lloyd Hopkins does have
many redeeming qualiries, He is a kind
man who eares very much for his daughe
rers and loves his wire very rnueh in his own
way. Hopkrrrs verysrrongly believes in pro
reering “the innocent,” and when he ﬁnds
evidenee srrggesrrng a serial killer preylng
on “irrnoeenrs,” well, ler's just say he does
nor break inro song and dense. However,
he has many negarive traits, as well. He is
very sexually driven. Okay, a srrong sexual
drlve is nor really a negarive eharaererisrie,
burwhen rhis rrair manifests itselfbychsnr»
mg on hrs wirewirh lirrle remorse, rhen we
have a more reprehensible eharaerer (not

 

ro menrion a more hrrman onel). Hopkins
does have several raeial prejudices, bur d-m's
life in Los Angeles. He is a hrrrre oh man
who has lirrle eonrrol over his own anger and
often aers rarher brazenly.

Wirh l-lophins's nemesis, Ellroy ar—
rempred ro ereare a psychoparhology rlre
leiller would use ro rationalize his aerrons ro
hrnrselr. He sralks women he considers “in-
rmeenr" orwholesome. we, ofcourxe, reale
izc rhar nobody is aerually “innocent," and
rhe rhoughr oisomeone being absolrrrely “in
noeenr" rs rarher silly. The klllcr goes
rlrrorrgh a rirrral rhar is rorrghlya rrronrh long
where he learns everyrlrirrg he possibly ean
abour his vierim, and even considers him-
selr ro he rhe victim’s beloved. The killer
quire llrerally rails in love wlrlr hrsvlerim and
ire believes he is killing ro save rhena from
rhe evils oflrre, Sumee ro say, hrs rrrorives
ror leilling are extremely sexual Whrle Ellroy
does do an admirable rob orsieerelring his
villain, he does nor go nruelr pasr his inirial
draft, a faer he has adrnirred himself. His
inabiliry ro fully ereare rhe psyehoparhology
ofliis villarn does nor, however, irrhibir rhe
novels abiliry ro inrrigue, excite, and arnuse
rhe reader.

B/vrdrn tthaalz is rlre rrrsr in an unin.
renrional rrllogy. Arrer Ellroy read Thomas
Harries novel RM Drnglm, a hoolr he can-
srders ro be rhe besr in rhe suspense genre,
he wanred a second rry ar erearirrg rhe
