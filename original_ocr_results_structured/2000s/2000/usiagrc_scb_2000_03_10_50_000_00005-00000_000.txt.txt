The star oflhls Show is Bano. AF»

Mosr surprising and

impressive is aerress Milla

Juvovleh's solo rendirion

of Lou Reed’s bc‘SK solo

song, “Sarellire of Love."

There are mulriple ver—

sions ofrhis rerriﬁe song

Saber’s remix version or rhe song,

which ineorporares Jon Hassell on

Irrhere is a serbaek in 777: Million

This isn’r a record for any occasion,

one afthe premier bands _
of New York Cirys “down—

bands in any genre rhar sound quit: like Sea Mob, They are yct
anorher oomple ofjazz musie evolving and readring rnro orher
genre ro ﬁnd a unique idenriry.

Since rhe release ofdlcir ﬁrsr disc, “Din oflnequity," rhe
band has been nddng up grear reviews in magazine and new
papers from all over. One publieau'on doenbed rhern as com»
binlng “die inrensiry of Louis Annsrrong's Hor Eyes and she
sonle mvenrion ofTrirky." The village voiee proclaimed Lhcm
as being “fanned wlrh dues ehords and rhe rrurh.” Sex Mob has
indeed raken rherr musiral inﬂuences from a mriery ofsoums
and melded rhern in so whar amounr a serious form orrunle

The bands disdncn'vc sound has ro do wirh rheir instru»
menrarion as well as dre musicll personaliries orlrs members.
The main lnsrnimenr ofrhc leader, Sreven Bemsrein, is a slide
rrumper. lnsread orhaving dae rradirional valves era “normal"

Briggan Krauss, has an orheevvondly one and melodiesensibil.
iry Kennywollensen (drums) and Tony Sdrerr (bass) providea
solid roundarion for rhe band, rheir sound ﬁnding is origin in
older ragrime and ﬁank rhyrhrns rhan uadluonal java And
drrough all ofrhis, ehey are one ofthe hardm rodsin’ bands
around.

Their repenoire ls ﬁning ror Lhcir personaliry as well. You

. woni ﬁndaslngle jau“smnd2rd” on anyoﬁheir reeordssave for

Duke Ellingrons “The Mood-l," But even rhls is desenbed as
“Storyviﬂc on mesorline" Ramer, rhey pull from a dilrerenr
songbook, eoveringrunes iikeAbba's ““Femando,“Jarna Browns
“Please, Please, Please," Nirvanas "About A Girl," Paul
Mecarrney's “Live and Ler Die." Much orrhe arne drese pieeo
seem ro have a moeklng rone, bur ar odrers, rhe songs’ minimal
sanctum serve as a playground for some oriazas ﬁnesr irnpro
vioers. The bands ongrnals are no la engaging, The ride rraek
ofd-ieir new album is an incrediblc jam wirh DJ Logic making
an apparanee. Anorher highlighr is rho Bernsrein rune “Nor
Bawccvii“ which learurrs rhe “Sex Mob chldrens Choir."

Undoubredly, rhis will be one of more unique ooneero rhe
GrinnclI umpus will see rhis year, maybe any year. Ccminly,
dais will be a dilrerenr show for me band as Gardner Lounge is a
Far cry ﬁom rhe Lower Fasr Side avane-mrde haunr ofTanic
