Well, the 2000
Summer Olympics are
over, and alll have to
say is that Svetlana
Khorkina deserves a
perfect 10. And maybe
a 9.6 in gymnastics.

Of course, we all
know that this years
Olympics weren’t about
breaking world records
or winning gold medals
or watching that weird
thing that Svetlana
can do on the uneven
bars. In tact, they
weren't even about the
culmination of all of
your most precious
dreams or about the
spirit prevailing over
the limitations of the
body, like NBC told us.
Sydney 2000 was
about the trampoline.

AS I watched
athletes bouncing up
to 65 n'ditulous feet in
the air with carnival
music playing on the
PA system, I knew
deep in my heart that
somehow, in some way,
the trampoline had to
be connected to the
state of Iowa. Later
that day, I found out
to my complete lack of
surprise that the
trampoline, in all of
anklerspraining glory,
was invented by Iowa-
horn tormencamie
George Nissen. That’s
n'ght, along with
Eskimo Pies, gasoline-
powered tractors,
buffered aspirin, and
screen doors,
trampolines are
misbegotten products
of boredom and Iowa.
Nissen, a three-time
National Tumbling
Champion (193537),
invented the
trampoline in Cedar
Rapids in the early
30s, after running
away with the circus.

The‘Sidney Olympics
are the first Olympics
where trampolining is
an event, and Nissen,’
85, was there to see it.
From what I saw on W
the event Seemed to
go smoothly. However,
if it was anything like
my own childhood
trampoline
experiences, {wouldn't
be surprised if
Alexandre Moskalenko
and Mathieu Turgeon
got into to a ﬁght over
who’s turn it was to
jump.

Without Nissan's
invention, not only
would theie not be a
trampoline event in
the Olympics, but that
kid I didn't like in
grade school would
have never dislocated
her shoulder.
