The calldidates for the Iowa state legislature contrasted theit views
on human service issues atz public forum lasr‘l'uesday, Danny Carroll,
2 Grinnell Republican, was ﬁrst elected in 1994. His challenger is Bill
Menner, a Democrat and former reporter for Public Radio station
KUNI.

The two lnen presented a classic contrast between liberal aild con-
servarive views orgovernmenr. Menner advomted paying more arren.

play a more limired role in the human services arena.

Carroll began by roiking aboui rhc problems the state legislature
races in organizing Suctal programs. More than halfofthe sisre's $2
billion human services budget come from fedenl aid, he said, and
“we are consranrly rroubled and {manned by the federal regulations"
rhai accompany federal money

“Ifl could wave n magic wand, i would ﬁgure our a wny ro decen-
tralize" human services ill Iowa, Carroll said. “With my background
in local government, I would like to see those areas decentralized."

lemphmsing Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Menner said that the
criricsl question for Iowa is, “how are we going to core for rhe people
who are r‘nost vulnerable in our society?" Iowans, Menner said, are
cliiioercriced by rheir compassion.

“We hear diarsrgumcnr every time s minimum wage discussion comes

“There are employers our there who look at the borrom line and

Monkey love

Grinnell Joli website debuts

Last Thursday an email with the subject heading-
“Somebody‘s gor a crush on yo popped up in my
WebMilil box. l don‘t cite who you are: that kind of
message is bound in erreh youreye olcourse l iend ir,

it turned out to be from the “Love Monkey" at
Grinnell's new slrernnrive homepage~ hrrpw
grr'nrie/iiloiiyjn/r ran).

“Someone who knows you rold me they’re inrer.
esiod in you," declared ilie Love Monkey, followed by
an mines: “please understand that this is not a ‘spam'
message."

Whir rhe heck, l rhoughr, clicking on rhe websire
rhey menrioned ro rry and ﬁgure our what rhe deil was
i didn't ger very tar, because es ir rurned our, learning
who my big crush was would email me ryping in ad-
dresses efall the people [we inrcrered in. irony orrhe
addresses matched that ofthe person who liked me, the
Love Monkey would send us each a secret emailiand
voila, the match would be made.

I didn't want to stick my neck out that far, burl can
see how it would be kind of fun. And since my Love
Monkey email coincided direcriy wim rhe 361?: request
for me to write an article about the “Daily Jolt." I ﬁg»
tired it must be fate.

As ir rurns our, our Daily lolr websire oliers a lot
more dun true love. In fact. it’s part ofa nationwide
organilation wirh well over a hundred pmiciparing Cole
leges and universities.

When a student at Amherst College emailed Gtinnell
wondering ifthc school would be inreresred in partici-
paring in Project ioir, a few srudenrs (who, in favor of
focusing on rhc mti'n‘ srudenr body, prefer ro remain
anonymous) jumped at rhe chance.

“I thought there was a deﬁnite void to ﬁll," said
one. “The omeni mmpus webpoge. while usehil is a
resource for prospecrivesrudenu and curious websuriers.
offers very little to Grinnell students themselves."

Much like an underground srudeur newspaper, rhe
Daily Jolt oﬁers an alternative ro rhe regular campus
homepage, boosringsslcwoiiniormarion on everyrhing
from the weather to what's for lunch.

“The onlinc calendar and memo lists only a fmce
non orrhc eycnrs happening on cimpus," a Daily Jolr
organlmrsaid, “and with the demise oftheVAX in 1999,
rhere is no easy, ecnrrol wiy fbr srudenrs ro commune
core and exchange ideas across campus."

With Dailylolt, there lsiTlm website offers a forum
For srudenrs where they em discuss prerry much any»

Since rhc websue is still young and developing, sue

ing questions such as “What is rhc besr way ro skin a
