Grinnt-ll’s Ultimate Frisbee teams are on-
tering their college season this springwidi quite
an increase in participation and commitment,
and so far it shows in their record. Last week
end they were at a tournament at Knox col-
lege, where they won 6 of7 games, losing in
the semifinals when they got tired. They have
five more tournaments
lined up forspring, includ-
ing the Mardi-Grasewceke
end tournament in Baton
Rouge, which draws most
Midwest teams, and die sec-
tional tournament, which
they are hoping to host at
Grinnell.

According to the Ultimate web page at
margarine”.edwgrrripr/irliimare, the men's
team mascot is the “Grinnelephant,” and the
women's is the “sticky Tongue Frog." in club
season in the fall, they play together, but they
split up for college season. However, though
the women's team has a solid core ofdedicated
members, they need more numbers so that they
can play as their own team more often. Ac-
cording to Kristin Grote ’02, “It's really fun;
the men aren't scary; and the more women, the
less we play with the men!" I

ball, but players can’t run with the disc; instead
they pass it to each other. The game has always
been selfeofficiating, so they don't use referees.
This encourages their friendly style ofcompea
tition At tournaments, all rhe reams hang out
talking wirh each other, ultimate players tend
to be bonded since there’s not that many people
who play

Garret Hansen ’02, a new member ofthe
team and their photoga

“it’s a pretry receptive

Matthias Mueller ‘00 says he likes ultimate
because “it gives me a place to be competitive
and do something adilericwirhout the burdens
and shortcomings of varsity athletics. you get
to be outside with some of your favorite
people."

The teams frequently have to travel long
distances to tournaments. They are hoping to

Are you getting bored with
the choice ofweckcnd activities
at Gtinnell? Well, this weekend,
to cap off Diversity Week, the
International Students’ Organi-
zation (ISO), will present you
with an entertaining option Lhis
Saturday.

More than forty students
have been working hard to put
together the ISO Cultural
Evening this Saturday night at
7p.m. in the Harris Center. The
evening begins with a two-part
talentshow, complimented with
food and rcfteshmcnm. The en-
tertainment promises to please.
The talent show includes every
thing from an international
band to a Latin American harp
solo and aJapanese comedy skit.
If you like to watch dance, or
even just like to dance yourself,
you will have plenty to enjoy.
Subcontinental dance, South
African gumboot dancing, and
even some contemporary Latin
American dance will be offered
for you to feast you eyes upon
and shake your booty to.

After the talent show, the

 

Cultural Evening moves on to a
fashion show featuring traditional
dress from countries such as India,
Japan, Nepal, and Barbados.

As if this wasn’t more than
enough entertainment, ISO is also
sponsoring a Harris party directly
after the fashion show.

So, besides a really great timc,
what does the Cultural Evening
have to offer? Sophomores Hisako
Wantanabc ‘02 and Maiko
Morotani ‘02, two of the coordie
natots ofthe evening, say that the
Cultural Evening provides an event
where international students can
share part oftheit culture, and the
audience can be exposed to cultures
other than their own. Both also
add that the time spent coordinat-
ing and rehearsing for the evening
is a chance for ISO members and
other international students to
bond and have a good time to»
gcthcr.

Morotani says that together
with the rest of Diversity Week,
which is sponsored by 0153 (Of-
flce of International Student Ser-
vices), the Cultural Evening lets
international students have an
“outlet, a chance to share their
uniqueness.” She says the she is
personally "cxcncd by the show,

International Diversity Week

[and is] amazed by what [those
involved] can do to bring dif-
ferent cultures together and dis»
play them to others.”

Alex Racho ‘00, a member
of the ISO Cabinet, calls the
Cultural Evening a “benchmark
of how well the organization
[ISO] works,” saying that he is
“stunned” by this year’s Cultural
Evening and similar events
sponsored by the ISO, Racho
attributes this success to recent
changes in the organization of
the ISO and its Cabinet, such
as allowing freshmen to become
more involved With the group.
Watanabe, Morotani and Roche
agree d-iat, partly because of this,
the ISO has taken a much more
optimistic attitude this year, as
well as having more energy, vi-
tality, and enrhusiasm asawhole
than in recent yCZI'Se

The ISO sponsored Cultural
Eveningwill beafantastic time,
you have been personally invited
to attend, and many people have
worked very hard to bring this
event together. So why not go,
and maybe you can pick up a
few African gumboot dance
moves to show offat the Harris
party afterwards,

BERKELEY, Calif. —

An Alameda County superior
Court judge issued a permanent in»
junction Thursday, barring an unaua
thorizcd note-raking service from
operating on any University ofCali-
fornia campus.

The default judgement, issued by
Superior Courr Judge Ken Kawaiehi,
resulted from the failure of RétR
Corporation to appear in court at any
point during the eightemonth laws
suir.rliecornpanysellslecturenorcs
to students without university per»
mission.

Executive Vice chancellor and
Provost Carol Christ, who tesnfied
during the lawsuit, said Roch had
engaged in several unethical business
practices,

“RszR is one ofrhose companies
that has operated a norcataleuig scr-
vice on campus in violation ofcam»
pus policies and without permission
of faculty members," .Chtist said
Thursday. "h produces notes ofvcry
low quality and has resulted to real
cxlorcionisi language,"

in her testimony, Christ said her
office had received numerous come
plainrs about the company.

Rock was not represented by an
attorney in the lawsuit, and no com-
pany representative appeared in
court. Attempts to locate the com.
pany, which had been using a mail»
ing address in the San Diego area,

were unsuccessful. .

“From the time we ﬁled theeom.
plainr and first tried serving them,
they‘ve been hiding from us," said
Michael coldsrein, an attorney for
the university. "We had to get an ore
det from the court permitting us to
serve rhem by publishing die sum.
mons in a newspaper."

Goldstcin said the injunction
means any attempts by Rout to con-
tinueopcratingonauc sampuswill
result in further legal action.

The director ofBlack Lightning,
the only noteeraltingscrvice approved
by the university, said he was relieved
by the injunction.

“This is one less flyrbyenight out.
or that the universitywill have to deal
with,“ said Raleigh Wilson. "The
university‘s position is that it has a
right to manage all commercial ac»
tivities on campus.“

Professor Robert Price, chair of
the political science department, said
the RSLR notes he had seen for his
classes had been woefully inadequate.

"The notes were badly done and
misunderstood the concepts,“ Price
said. "students who read them would
have been misled."

While some professors have said
they would like to see similar action
ralren against onhne notc»raking
companies, lawyers for the university
said yesterday they have no pending
litigation against anyothcr limcetak-
ing service.
