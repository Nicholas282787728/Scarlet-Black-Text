Deft cast and crew make play a winner

By Michael
Anderse n
Staff Writer

When the barn doors
opened and you saw rhe rwo
men stumbling up rhe hill in
the fading Iowa afternoon, you
rhoughr ar ﬁrst that you were
just looking at a couple oflor
cals, happening by rhe site of
rhe play you were abour ro see.

Then, as their faces came
inro conrour and you began us
see rhe poise orrheir shoulders
and melopeofmeirsrrides, you
realized that these ﬁgures
weren’t intruders after all. They
were Lenny and George. Oh,
rhey were cleverly disguised as
David Nunez ‘01 and Jesse May
‘02, bur you knew berrer. These
was the pair you knew and rhe
pair you loved, rhe ones you
came for but the ones that you
had been rrained nor ro expecr
[0 see.

You saw them. You saw
rhem and all their glory and all
rheir pain. all channeled
through the beautiful honesty
of Steinbeck’s dialogue. And
you saw Candy and you saw

Curly and you saw Slim.

The six most heinous crime:
or lasr weekend were empry
sears at sarurday's performance
ofJohn Steinbeck’s OfMire and
Mm,

The wayir allworked is kind
or hard to explain. Attendees
showed up ar Norrh Lounge
and were filed into school vansr
which transplanted rhe audir
ence to a barn several miles
westward The auditorium was
a series of benches inside the
building and at ﬁrst it looked
like the srage was going ro be
the ﬂoor in ftontofthem.Then
rhe doors rolled open and the
magic began.

Not all rhe scenes were per-
formed ourside. The casr deirly
used their mock proscenium
and a minimal ser (six hay bales
ro be precise) ro simulate a va-
ricty orserrings. But rhe reel-iv
nical ingenuiry or a semi—outs
door performance injected rhe
play wirh a srunning vitality,
down to the subtle rumble oF
distant conversation that the
company took care to insert
during appropriate scenes.

As for the ensemble, this was
an as much all-star cast of
Grinnell thespian: as one could
hope tor. May came oirrwo suc»
cessiul comedic roles ro perform
drama wirh equally impressive
sincerioy. Nunez, who rore up
the srage as Albee’s Jerry (and
O'Brian’s Dr. FrankeNeFurter,
for that matter), seems to die at
the end of all his shows but al»
ways rurns heads first. Lenny is
a difﬁcult characrer to play
wirhour slipping into caricar
turc; Nunez avoided it with
skill. The ever—exemplary firsr—
year Per Janson played rhe one»
armed Candy with skill and
subrlery; Donovan Sherman
broughr his nervous, virile in-
saniry ro a wondernrlly convinc»
ing (if arguably typecast) por—
rrayal of curley. John Carrol-r,
who glimmered during March's
Private Liﬁ, played farmhand
Slim with naturalistic EHCCEiVE-
ness. And Emily Austin gave a
transcendent performance as
curley's sentimental, unhappy,
and unnamed wife.

The show coalesced several
monrhs ago in a process or

which Steinbeck mighr have
approved: Nunez’s brainchild
from ayear ago, Mice and Men
was communally direcred by a
casr assembled on a volunreer
basis, and rhe resulr was a
group of people whose pro—
gram nores berrayed an almosr
religioussenseoffraternily(ins
deed. when prompred, rhey all
seem ro lower their voices reve
erenrly when discussing rheir
experience). This success (as
well as rhar or lasr monrh's
“The Lover") seems to speak
stronglyfor me benerirs ofselfr
produced rhearre.

No, rhis show doesn't be
and end all, The RSC needn’t
hang up rheir hars. Once or
rwice, emorion seemed forced.
srage movemenr was some—
rimes sraric, though never
clumsy But even rhcse came
off as appropriare; sreinbeek's
rexr is as srarkly realistic as it is
gut—wrenching. The grearesr
rragedy or this performance is
that it will never be seen again.

On rhe orher hand, none
of rhe show's crearors will be
graduaring this spring. . .. well,
a reporrer can only hope.
