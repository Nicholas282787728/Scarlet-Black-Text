The films orisaae Julien belong re rhar rare

hind ofCinema [hit is rruly, inadly, deeply daring

and edgy, followingin rhe path

Julien :xplores rhe eornplexiries
or represenraiion and idenriry,
lace and desire. Two orhis rilrris
that I’ve seen are hemsges to
two gianrs orblaele rheery and
literature: Frantz Fanon and
Langsron Hughes.

Film fused Julian's inter-
esrs in painring, phorography,
design, aering and eulrural rheery. Consequently.
his rilrns draw from diverse visual airs disciplines and
esehew traditional narrative and genre reeipes. They
are melanges orarehival footage, drarnarie reerearions
and rnonrage, weaving lyrie, deeurnenrary, ﬁction.
