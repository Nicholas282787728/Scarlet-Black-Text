The Yugoslav rtlevo/ution:

The .e . '
begmmn

*by Nina

I left my hometown,
Belgrade, Yugoslavia,
for one primary tea.
sone Yugoslavia has
become a country
Without a future.
belgrade is where I
spent most of my life,
where my parentslive,

where my best friends ate. What happens there, inevitably, roaches
me.

Thursday, oct. 5, 2000, in just two hours, everything in my
country changed. On the Fifth ofOcrobcr, the citizcns ofSerbia, 071::
again, but this time, stronger then ever, showed that they have the
intention to escape the historical deadecnd, to end a long and most
unfortunate decade in their, turbulent, ohcn, tragic history.

The culmination ofthe demonstrations happened in Belgrade,
where the mass eruption and quick and bloodless collapse oithc re»
giiiic rcscmblcd the fall oflhc Berlin Wall, 198‘), That day, on the
streets oiBelgradc, one could see that the personal regime oiSlobodan
Milosevic was falling into agony with each hour and was like a ﬁsh
on dry land that is begging for its pathetic survival.

The crowd, after the “chemical warfare” with rhc police and the
tear gas, smoke in their eyes, and most importantly bursting anger in
rhcit hearts, stormed the main tools of power of (l’IL‘ old rcgimc— the
Parliament and the Slate Television building. When the polic: low»
cred theirweapons, shields and gas masks and joined the people, and
the) Parliament and the State Television_wcrc on ﬁre, it was over.

~ Ho [Milosevic], was ﬁnally ﬁnished (as the most popular goo.
rarion of the demonstrations stares). Drums, whistles, swear words,
chaos, smoke and, energy, hope and democratic spirit in every citi.
zcn, Victory and Peace, ﬁnally. in two hours, the regime based on llc'S
and violence was thrown away to the dustbin oihistory, in the recyc
cling machine.

I was not there to tell you the cxaci atmosphere, but i could
very well imagine and feel it, even so rat away. . .

friend wmrc. '

As I heard THE news, I cried. Nor of rear gas, as all rhe crowd
had; someone yelled as the police sprayed tear gas, “He wants every
body crying when he leaves." No, I cried out of happiness. For the
first time the breakmgnews on Yugoslavia were not about
war, atrocities, crisis, and aggression. This time, the
people made sure that the words to be heard and re.
membered arc pride, revolution, peace and victory.

I also cried ior the stolen 13 years during the
dicraror’s rule. The truth is that ir actually rook us 13
years and two hours to get rid ofMilosevic. it is painful
to realize now all that we lived through in those 13 years
that were taken from us.

What next? Everyone asks the same question. Let
us bask in out so long awaited euphoria at least a little
longer.

The normal life still seen-is unreal to most. No more
lies, no more propaganda, no more corruption in the
media. “[t} weird, t/ert rzrr no more idiot: rm TW’ one of
my friends says.

One man is gone, bur he left a lot ofholes behind
him. The restoration oia ruincd economy with ten years oiwar and
sanctions and the elimination of“lhcm"- thcsupportcrsoftheshame-
iul regime, the deepoliticiaation oithc civic institutions are only the
ﬁrst steps in the long road towards the complete democratic transfor—

survival.

 

On the streets of
Belgrade, one could see
that the personal regime
of Slobodan Milosevic was
falling into agony with
each hour and was like a
ﬁst on dry land that was
begging for its pathetic

 

matron.

with him gone, the greatest obstacle to the forum is removed,

Without him, itcan only be better. However, the democratic powA
ers also lose their greatest excuse and now, their weaknesses will not be
covered,

Another question is: when will Milosevic really be gone-vanished?
To the 1C] in the Hague, to another country,
anywhere, people just want him to disappear
forever.

one thing is clear. with October 5. an
cm ofwarcmongcring media, demagogical rule
oiaurocrats and murderers, dangerous manic
acs and cynical thieves, corruption, isolation
and abnormality is over, and none oithe post.
revolutionary excesses could compromise and
call into question the main achievements oi
the Big Change that just happened.
