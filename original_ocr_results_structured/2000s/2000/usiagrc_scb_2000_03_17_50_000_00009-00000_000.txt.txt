I shink he was sighs on siaek when
he said shas shis campus lacks “ciisi.

raes shas, despise cxczllcnt classes on
social issues, l have only iuss begun
so examine sesms such as “diversity"
and “multiculturalism” on a non»
abssiaes and noneaeademie level. I
was ahaid shas l miglis sound ﬂip-
pans and insensisive when discuss»
ing an issue 1 ssuly cased abous.
Thus, beroie she debase, I decided
so avoid such sesms i decided so
show shas, il‘l wsie elecsesi piesi.
dens, I would make it my psiosisy
so admis whas i do nos know and
so ask nucssions of shose who ase
wisei shan me. Howeves, when she
momens asose in she debase ros me
so answes my own ouession abous

suddenly ahaid oiseeming ssupid,
in my reas, i launched inso she sub
ject wishous shinking and, shough
i knew i was oiiending people, i
could nos ﬁnd a way so ssop. Al»
shough 1 means so say shas I hoped
whise ssudenss would ssop shink-
ing or anyone as “she oshei". my

My teass made me say shings
shas I wish I hadn's. My reass ase

sells me shas we all need a wake up

When i ian my wsise in Cairns

nal candidases and esisical of
SGA, bus mildly so. is has only
been since l began she campaign
shas I have seen iuss how much
mose ensicai i should have been.
When I look back on she lass
shsee weeks i sell myselishas I
should have known whas would
happen. Mycampaign was inhese

reel involved in SSA so sake aee

cising shose wish she moss so lose
by an inﬂux of new people inso
she syssem—she oiiginal candi-
dases and my iellow senasoss. We
senasoss have ous mics, shose shas
ase explicit and shose shas an-
implied. I should have known
shese would be backlash when
l ignosed she implicis code. In a
way, I did know shese would he
one, bus I did nos see how vin»
diesive and selhdeiensive is
would be.

At hiss I shoughs she sace
could semain as civilised as is had
been in she psoeeeding swo
weeks. I was simply psoviding
vosess wish anoshes opsion. I
knew many people wouldn's
know who i was, so my hope was
mesely so make she runsoff. I had
no oshes intentions. I shoughs
she oiiginal candidases and sheis

iseeeived onlya rew hinssoihow

Then I won she mood, and shas
nighs as Joins Board l discovescd
shas i was going so pay ros my
naivctc,

The big issue shas nighs
susned ous so be my ssaiemens
or insens. The Elecsion Board

sake in wsising daas sensence, and
iwansed so apologise, Whas l am
psosessing is she raes shas none
ofthc senasoss os candidases who

demanded shas my ssasemens be se-
viewed beiose Joins Boasd adiousned
sold me oi she Eleesion Board ahead
of sime so expecs such a icacsion. i
have been sold shas shose who psoe

makes me doubs shas cxcusc.

Had anyone sold me shas shey
shoughs my ssasemens was illegal by

was a way so publicly chassise me roi
playing ousside she implieis sules. Not
selling me was a way of sseasing me
like she uneshical, esarsy, psanksses I
was accused orbeing sashes shan a Fel-
low ssudens.

Sadly enough shough, as I consides
she centcxt orshe polisies and powes
selasions ofour socissy as a whole, I
am nos suspsised by she acsions oishas
nighs oi orlass week's Joins Boasd. ls
seems so me shas, iryou csisicias she
self-isnpossanee ora govesning body
and she people involved in is, is is
implied shas you don’t desesvs a
ehance as insmbesship, and it you
don's have inembesship, yous cnsicism
won’t be heasd. This is a cycle shas
keeps Amesiea's rwosparty sysseni in
business. Fusshesmose. wheshes you’re
ousside she inssisusion, os aesually
wishin, ifyou ase esisical, is is implied
shas you don's know when you'se talks
ing abous and shas you don’s show any
sespecs fos shas inssisusion and iss
membess. l have been sold shas my
campaign “tactics" wesc uneshieai, i
have also been sold shas I showed no
sespees ios senios senasoss and she
osiginal candidases. I insiss shas I have
always sespeesed she commismens or

SGA Thasdoesn’s mean, shough, shas
I can’t criticize their motivations or ac»

mean shas she vosess didn’t have she

is was when my suppossess wese
csisicised shas I finally sealized how
much sociesal gendci soles, like po-
lisical games, ase psesens as cnnnell.
i saw shas many orshe csisicisms l and
my suppossess seeeived would nos
have been applied so a man. i was sold
shas women wese vosing ios me “iuss

sold shas I muss have been salked inso

she hiss accusasion was so deny shas
women would vose ios me iuss bes

rels insulsed. Now my sesponse is
