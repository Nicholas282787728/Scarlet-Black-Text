TV REVIEW: Berg’s Wonderland sees sanity
through the looking glass

By Jennifer Fogel
Michigan Daily (U. Michigan)

(U-W‘lRE) ANN ARBOR, Mich. 7 ABC’s ncw hour—long
drama Wonderland is nor ER or Cbl'mgw Hoprr It is like no orher
liospiral drama rhar has been relevised before. This is “ER" on acid.
\Vmultr/(md rakes hold of your mind, plays wirh ir a lirrle, rhen
rerurns ir complerely mysrifled.

Let's srarr from rhe beginning. When asked ro describe whar a
chicfof forensic psychiarry (rhe psychiarric srudy orcriminology)
ar Rivcrvuc psychiarric Hospiral does, Dr. Robert Banger (Ted
Levine) explains, “We secrerly call n she Barbarians Gare. When
rhe pressures ofmedern socrery become roo grear for a person. When
one's chemical dynamic becomes such rhar rhey are unbalanced
rhey cease painring in rhe lines, rhey come ro us." The docrors ar
Rivervue are rhe garekeepers rhar guard rhc “normal" world from
rhe mcnrally ill. But we soon come ro learn rhar rhese docrors can'r
prorecr rhemselves from rheir parienrs or rhe world as large,

The premiere episode begins wirh a glimpse inro a group rherapy
session. The scene is basically a meraphor for rhe enrire premise of
rhe show. One simple quesrion or acrion can lead ro unexpecred
evenrs, including all hell breaking loose. But where's rhe doctor?
The docror just sirs rhere, powerless ro do anyrhing, as his group
begins ro fall aparr all around him. “Wonderland's” docrors are nor
abour rhe power ro conrrol life and dearh, but rhe power ro learn
rhar you cannor conrroi everyrhing.

Underscored by rhc percussion of“Thc Lirrle Drummer Boy,”
WmdtrL/mdcuts ro rhe morning rourines orrhe Rivervue docrors.
Dr. Banger explores rhc minds ofhis rwo young sons as he makes
rhem Mickey Mouse pancakes while worrying rhar he will perma—
nenrly lose custody of them ro his cx-wifc, We meer Dr. Abe
Marrhews (Billy Burke), a Commitmentrphobic womanizer who
will flirr wirh anyrhing mobile, He rakes rheaudience along on one
ofhis rherapy sessions, where he describes sex as a “brain hijacking”
and fears anyrhing commitment—related including rhc “double-ream
answering machine message.” Nexr, we’re inrroduced ro Dr. Neil
Harrison (Marrin Donovan), anorher forensic specialrsr, and his
pregnanr wife Dr. Lila Carriry (Michelle Forbes of “Homicidc”),
head of rhe Comprehensive Psychiatric Emergency Program (the

CPEP, in orher words, rakes walking and emergency psych parienrs).
These four docrors are on rheir way ro anorher appropriarely crazy
day. .

For srarrers, Wendell Riclde shoors five people in rhc middle of
Times Square because die gods rold him ro. (He has a lirde rrnuble
disringuishing himself from Odysseus, or for rhar marrer, Odysseus
from Zeus.) Alongwith his vicrims, Wendell is admirrcd ro Rivcrvue
in rlie midsr ofa media frenzy. There is no doubr that Wendell is
gurlry, bur is he insane? Unforrunarely, rhar question is nor asked
righr away because ir rurns our four days earlier, Dr. Garriry had
dismissed Wendell as complerely coherenr and rurned him loose

from rhe hospiral. Trying ro make up for her error, Dr. Garrirycnds'

up involved in an ER accidenr rhar leaves her baby in crirical con.
drrion and rhe medical review board wairing to press her on her
diagnosis,

Meanwhile, Dr. Marrhews rries-ro evaluare asuicidc parienr. In
order so make him undersrand rhe severity of his problem. Dr.
Marrhews rell rhe paricnr abour rhe “science" die CPEP ward em-
ploys. This science explains rhe varying degrees ofsuicidc arremprs,
rheir ourcomes and rhe resulring basis for rrearmenr orsuieide pa-
rienrs, Evcnrually, rhe man begins ro undersrand his depression.
bur nor before he helps reach rhis Commitmentrshy docror rhe ioys
ofmarriage.

Whar makes this show exceprional is rhe lack otanyrhing like it
before. Perer berg, who played a doeror himself in Chic-ugly Hope
and was rhe brains behind rhe film very Bad Thingt, created “Won-
derland," He and rhe wrirers spenr monrhs ar a New York hospiral
researching and working wuh psychiarrisrs and ER physicians. The
srorylines are inspired by tealrlifc experiences of rhe sraffand pa.
rienrs. But whar really grips rhe viewer is rhe way Madonna is
shor — almosr as if it were a serial documenrary. Each week we learn
more abour rhe inner workings of rhe docrors rhan rheir parienrs,
which makes rhe show more appealing.

marrierkmdalso gives us a glimpse inro rhe world otdre “Shadow
People,” rhose who are rhrown inro rhe menral healrh sysrcm with
no regard, save from some who make ir rheir life's work ro help
rhem. These docrors have a nearly impossible job, rrying so keep
rhemselves sane, ler alone their parienrs. Mndnlmd is already
warchable, bur irs colorful layers ofcra‘tincss can only gcr berrer as
rhe season goes on.

Film Review:
Straight Out of
Brooklyn

By Courlney Houghom and
Aaron Slockham
Slaff Columnisls

It’s appropriate that Straight Out Of
Brwklyn is showing rhe weekend be.
fore Tirular Head. Directotrwriter-pro-
ducer Marry Rich was 17 when he be»
gan work on rhe ﬁlm and 19 when he
finished it and it got picked up by
Samuel Goldwyn company. The ﬁlm
reminds one immediately of Push,
which showed in Norrh Lounge a few
weeks ago, in irs naruralisric look and
the story of a young black man living
in the “ghetto.”

The film is abour a black reenager,
Dennis, who makes rhe decision so go
“srraighr our of Brooklyn" by doing
wharever ir rakes. When Dennis' girlr
friend, Shirley, suggesrs rhar he go ro
college, Dennis responds by saying rhar
he doesn’t have Four or five years to
waste - he needs to improve his life and ‘
his family’s immediarcly. The only vi»
able oprion in his siruarion is ro come
mir a robbery ofsome kind. Dennis
and his rwo boys, Larry and Kevin,
wind up robbing a drug dealer for a lot
of money, Larry and Kevin immedi—
ately frcak out, aware that their victim
is going ro come down hard on rhem.
cht alonc, Dennis decides to take his
chances. Thugs no going back for him.

There is a great deal of social crir
rioue in the film, nor surprising con—
sidering irs subjec‘r. Unlike many such
ﬁlms, however, Straight 0w DfBrau/t-
[ya is quire explicir in irs political con»
rcnr. Rich does a sweec job ofmaklng
his polirical poinrs wirhour falling inro
cliches and didacric speeches.

Indecd, the politics ofthis ﬁlm, like
that of all art Works, is inseparable from
irs aesrherics. one quickly symparhiees
with Dennis because of who he is—cat»
ing, passionare, inrelligenr a as well as
because ofhis situation determined as
ir is by class and race. The ﬁlm makes
rhc implicir poinr rhar power derer.
mines lifc chances as well as people's
responses.

The ﬁlm leaves us with a powerful
sense ofwhat life is really like for black
yourh in she gherro rhanks ro a simple
and inreresring srory and complex
eharacrcrs. The ending is especially
grarifying because of irs honcsry.
Straight Out of Brlwélyn reminds us
that what we see in pop culturc, (hes:
images that sell a certain “rebellious"
and “hip” arrirude ofinnerrcity life, are
romanticiled imagcs of the ghetto.
That isn’t the real ghetto as this Film
plainly shows. While there's a great deal
of crcariviry and resisrancc in rhc
gherro, rhere isn'r anyrhing romanric
about it.
