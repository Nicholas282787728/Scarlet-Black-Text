Movie Review: American Psycho

By Joseph Michaels
Staff Columnist

Why is it rhar every arricle i have ever
seen nbour rhis movie has made a poinr ro
call arrcnrion ro rho her that Leonardo
DiCaprio’s name was once arrached ro rhis
project? Honcsriy, who really cares? He's
not in rhe Film, had norhing ro do wirh
rhe ﬁlm, shouldn'r have anyrhmg ro do
wirh
plugging his name? Maybe I have a deeply
butlcd love For Leo, and am only now be»
ginning ro realize it... Okay, now rhar that’s
off my chest, I can begin dealing wirh the
merirs and flaws orrhe mm.

American Frye/re, adapred from rhc
novel of rho same name by Brct Enston
Ellis, details cerrnin aspecrs in die life of
Patrick Bateman, a Wall Srreer exceurive
who is essentially a caricrrure or ’SO's-cra
business moguls. He is
driven by marcrial pas—
sions, comperirion. and
physical beaiiry, which
naturally do nor make
for a very fulﬁlling life.
in fact, in die opening
minurcs or rhs film,
Bareman rells rhc audi—

and very early in rhe him we see him Vern

people) between humor
