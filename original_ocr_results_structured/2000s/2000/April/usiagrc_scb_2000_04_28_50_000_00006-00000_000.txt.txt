Jo Calhoun prepares to move on

By Mali Lorenz
StaffWriter

These days, Jo Calhoun, in
Academic Advising, feels a little
like a graduating senior at Gtin<
nell: she’s got some “senioritis,”
and she empathizes with their job
hunt. Drawn by family, sunshine,
the mountains, and the city, she
is leaving Grinnell after sixteen
years and moving to Denver,
where both of her children are.
She will be very fondly remem-
bered, at least for four years, much
as her predecessor, Ray
Obermiller, academic advisor and

swim coach, was.

, When talking about Calhoun,
her many fans use words like
“saint” and “groovy,"

Calhoun started out at Grin-
nell as a secretary in the CDC,
and then ran the internship pro-
gram for six years. When
Obermillet quit academic advise
ing, the job was made into a fulle
time position that Calhoun took
in 1991. No one else really Wanted
the job; many called it the “job
from hell,” since it’s dealing with
students in trouble, but Calhoun
didn’t see it that way at all. “It’s

been a great match for me; I re-
ally love it." She is a seminary
graduate and hoped to be a dean
ofwornen at a seminary college.
but those jobs disappeared. Worle
ing one on one with students in
her current position turned out to
be just what she wanted.

Calhoun believes that in the
CD0, students will “gec along
with or without you, but [in Aca-
demic Advising] you can make a
bigger difference. People need you
more; you feel like there‘s a rea-
son to come to work in the morn-
ing." Generally, students who
come to her have a problem that
is interfering with their academic
progress, and Calhoun helps them
solve it. She’s glad that all she has
to do is fix a problem, instead of
giving anyone bad news.

Other parts of Calhoun's job
are that she works with the New
Science Project (NSF) and assigns
students to tutorials. The N81" is
fun for her since the students,
first-years from traditionally un-
der-represented groups in science,
are great, and she gets to know
them well.

Realizing that many students

put her on a pedestal,
Calhoun points out that it's
an “easy job to be popular
in." She has to “pull
someone’s selfesteem out of
the garbage, . . . just validate
people that they're really
smart." She describes how,
inevitably, some students
who gorA's in high school are go-
ing to be in the C to F range of
the curve when rhey’re among the
Grinnell population, but
Grinnellians as a whole are still a
“rareﬁed group.” “I find these stun
dents easy to love. i think they feel
cared for by me,“ she said.

A frustrating part ofthe aca-
demic advisingjob can be parents
who have a “consumer mentality,”
disgruntled that they paid so
much money and their student is
getting bad grades out oFit. She
tries to ”get parents to understand
that students have to assume re—
sponsibiliry for their arm our.
comes,” It’s also frustrating to
watch a student do something
that they both know is destruc»
tive. On the other hand, the best
part is when students get theiract
together. “Commencement is ten
ally a big deal to me.” She watches
people walk across Stage who
weren’t sure they were going to
make it.

Calhoun appreciates
Grinnell’s progressive nature, and
she likes the faculty and the way
students are treated, “My sense is
that most faculty and staff here

"I ﬁnd these students easy
to love. I think they feel
cared for by me”

~Jo Calhoun

really respect students . . . we all
step up to what’s expected ofus."
She also likes the approach that
Student Affairs takes. Most
schools have a punitive approach,
busting students for infractions of
rules, but Calhoun doesn’t agree
With that.

A change that Calhoun has
seen in her time here is that SEUA
dents are “more civil.” They used
to be angry, but now tend to be
patient and work within the in»
stitution for change. She told of
how students pounded on the
dean’s office to get the sac (origin
nally called the Human and Gay
Resource Center) founded. Now
they are willing to talk more.

Something that hasn’t
changed is that every year, the se»
niors complain about the
Abercmmbie 8c Fitch and what»
not among the conservative fu’Stv
years, but by the time they’re see
niors, freshman are acting like the
current seniors.

Calhoun has some advice for
those looking for her replacement:
“Don’t look for 3 Jo Calhoun
clone. ThatH be a mistake. . . . Be
open and welcoming to the next
person
