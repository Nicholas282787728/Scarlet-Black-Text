Those last two words seem to pop up with regularity irnot

is Grinnall changing for the worse, as the grafﬁti would seem
to suggest? Is it changing at all? Why? in an effort to gauge
upinion on the issue, the Starlet 6V HIM/e asked a numhet of

Three years after the fact, few seem to hold the same opin-
ion; Stoh would add, “I don’t think [the prevailing view] was
true at all."

But a gradual dritt toward conventionality is not an un-
common idea among students, juniors and otherwise.

“I don't want to say there’s not as much ota push
at creatiiiity and ditrerenriation as there used to
be, but it does sort oFsccm like that," said Jus-
