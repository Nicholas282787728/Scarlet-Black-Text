get a page that looks like Webmail, out your

folder appears to be empty. "Odd," you think.

”I don‘t remember deleting everything." iiou

look at the top or your screen. in bold red

What's going on? Vou sent a message to
someone who was over quota, so the message
popped back to you with a corrupt header.
This is a particularly common problem when
you are sending out messages to large
numbers of people; e,g., ifyou are a group.

What does that mean? Your account isn‘t
empty; the server just can‘t read what's in it
because of the corrupted ﬁle.

What do you do aboutit? Go to HS,
apologize sincerely for any inconvenience,
and ask to have the corrupted message
removed. leaving it alone is not going to
make it go away.

How do you prevent ’ it you are a
campus group, get a Lyris account for your
