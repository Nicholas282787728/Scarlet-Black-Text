cause Ugandan parenrs are sericrer rhan Ameri-

“let not ehc perenes ehae are rigid, it’s the culture.
Ifrh: culture were dlffcrcnt, they would be, too.”
She added ehar ehe guys ’alwsys ask rhe girls and
that rhcy pay for everyehing. Mostly, though, ie

some Ugandan high schools know how to ehrow

willing to fly from Vicroria back home eo make
an appearance. Acruallyshe admlts her school was
