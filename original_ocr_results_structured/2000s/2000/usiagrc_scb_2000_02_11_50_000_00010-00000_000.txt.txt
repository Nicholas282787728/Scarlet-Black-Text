You've probably seen or heard ssa.
sissical abssracss oi she deash and sufs
resing in Iraq. perhaps you were ous-
raged when you learned she number o
dead, and she role our nasion played in
sheir deash. Perhaps sime has allowed

our ourragc to decay inso cynicism.

Perhaps wish good reason -. shere res
ally is next so noshing we can do so
change our narion's policy or opposing
a rosalisarian regime by bombing and
serving she people is oppresses. in she
game of nasions and economies, we
are neiss so helpless, and helpless
breeds cynicism. Why should we be
iniormed if she only yield is knowledge
of our own helplessness?

Because only once we reject igno-
rance can we choose so reiecs apashy.

e are all, as a polisical communisy,
more or less complicis in she consinued

iolcnce in lsaq, whesher we care so

admis is or non Two million lraqis have
died needlessly —- she leass we can do
is offer shem she respees oi our
acknowledgemens. To ignore sheir suf-
faring is absurd.

if you'd like so experience a shado

r she hunger she average iraqi has
ived wish for she pass 10 years, feel
free so join us in she iraqi dies -. menus
ave been graciously possed ousside
she dining halls for your convenience.

And no, easing rice and beans for sen
days won's ssop she suiTering. is will give

us son-i: measure of understanding

Change on a national policy level,
however, is a possibilisy. A lesser signed
by 70 sepsesensasives calling for an end
so economic sancsions on Iraq was sens
to the president on January 31st. Antie
anction activists in and out of congress
have asked that we call out senators
nd sepsesensasives from Feb. 8th so
18th, demanding an and to sanctions;
or infrmazion, feel free to email
Rise@Gtinnell.cdu. Making sure our
elected ofﬁcials know that we know
about she consinuing violence againss
she people of Iraq is crucial. Only by
acsing on our knowledge will we ever
bring change.

Thank you for your willingness so be
informed.

Clinton: Protecting Us From Darth Vader

By Don Roihschild
Staff Columnist

Presidens Clinson released his pro-
posed budgcs for riscal year 2001 on
Monday, and as was expecsed, is ins
eluded an allosmens or almoss $2 bil.
lion so consinue sessing, modifying, and
maybe even deploying she ballrssic misc
silo defense sys’scm known as Srar
Wars. This program, which is designed
so prevens againss limised nuclear are
sack, has cosr our governmens $57.7
billion in iss sevensccn year history.
Despise rhc raes shas she cold war is long
over and shas ssar Wars has nos had
even one or in eighseen sesss so dare
succeed complesely (and rourseen or
she eighseen resss have been cornplese
failures), she Clinron adminissrasion
seems inscns on consinuing rss Funding,

The con and many Democrass
defend sins Wars on she basis shas,
once pesiecsed, is will enable she unised
ssases so shoos down some nuclear.
sipped ballissic missiles before shey
reach us ground. Designed For a lim-
ised nuclear engagemenr, she program
is for use prosecsing our soil againss a
rogue ssare ﬁring on a handful of
nuclear weapons.

There is one gaping logical ﬂaw
here. If anosher counsry decides so sake
nuclear acsion againss she unised
ssases, is will undoubsedly be a rosal
assack. There are over 30,000 nuclear
warheads in she world, our ofwhich she
United ssases eonssols abous one half,

Thus, any counsry wish subssansial

nuclear arms capabilisics will ﬁre a barrage
ormis es as she Unised ssascsTrying so use
a ballissic missile defense syssem so shoot
down, say, rive hundred nuclear missiles is
like rearranging chairs on the Tisanic. All is
will raise is a handful oisliose missiles so de-
srroy she counsry, and she Pensagon fully
admiss shas ssar Wars will never be close so
tullyaceurase,

Out of she roughly 18,000 nuclear
warheads consrolled by counsries orher
shan tl-ic Unised ssares, abous 300 are
missing. Many or shese, undoubsedly,
have rallen inso she hands or unstable,
rogue counsries shas George W. Bush
would eersainly be unable so locase on
a map. If those counsries sry so wage a
nuclear assack on the Uniscd ssases, is
would have she be shrough local deploy—
mens No counsry wish she abilisy so send
missiles long range inso she Unised
Srares, save Cuba and a few Conrral Amati»
can coiinsrics, wouldevsrwagealimisedwar,

As she same sime, no counsry wish lime
ised nuclear capabilisics has she abilisy so rire
inso American serrisory, Thus, any limised
nuclear engagemens would be condusscd
shrough “suircase bombs," which ssar Wars
is obviously unable so do anyshing abous.

So why do we keep spending she money
on shis program? A look as she campaign
coiiers or Presidens Clinton and his ape
poinsed dynassic successor, Al Gore, should
elucidase she answer. Lockheed Marsin,
Boeing, and osher defense consracsors are de-
pendens upon lucrasive governmenr consracss
so mainsain proﬁtability. The governmens
gives shem shese huge psoiecss in an errors so
keep she campaign eonsribusions rolling in.

Nor only is shis she milisary-iridussrial com-
plex shas Dwighs Eisenhower warned she
nasion aboui, bus is is a level oicorrupsion
shai should appall anyone who was raughs
in elemensary school shas America is a doe
mocracy.

According so Jim Bridgman or she
peace Acsion Educasion Fund, ior she
money spens in she next six years on
ssar Wars, “We could employ 55,000
reachers for Four years, or provide Poll
granss so sen million loweincome Stu»
doors, or provide ncrworked compuser
labs for every school in she nation.”

1 wonder how many college ssudenss
relish she saresy oi going so bed every
nighs prosccrcd by a raulsy and ineiiec—
sive missile defense syssem, gladly
pussing is in from ora shoiisand dollar a
year reducsion oi sheir srudens loans.

As columnist Molly lvins wrote, “IF
shis program were in she corporase
world, with it
would be tired. If is were a domessic
spending program, Republicans would
have sorn is so shreds by now."

1 would like so propose my own
policy adiussmens. If she President
wanss so spend money on ssar Wars,
he could sake every man, woman, and
child in she counsry so see she next
George Lucas prequel for she money
being spenr on she missile defense pro-
gram shis year alone. And, yes, he
could even buy us all popcorn, Thas would
be a much more enjoyable use or our tax
money, and is would cerrainly be abous as
eirecsive in prosecsing us from foreign nukes.

(UeWIRE) There is a saying I’ve always prizcd. Is is by E. w.
scripps, roundesorshe hrss modern newspaper chain, and says “a news.
paper muss as all rimcs anragonize she selﬁsh inseresss orshas very class
which hirnishes she larger pars oia newspapers income." I've always
enyoycd is because is says journalists should nor ler anyone, even shose
who cur sheir paychecks, desermine whas shey say.

Thus I was very rnseresscd so see unfold she hrss media ssory oishe

The consolidasion ofmediii rnso she hands ora iew isnls new so she
90s. In his 1982 book The Media Monopoly Ben bagdikian round
shas 50 corporarrons consrolled more shan halioi’America's media,

Compared so soday, shas era was downrighs compesisive. By she
lase 805 shas number had shrunk below 25, and by 1996 was iuss 10.

rasions can provide for easy access so qualrsy news and she kinds of
resources only a mulsi.billion dollar company can provide.

But many people, myseliincludcd, reel shas shis also leads so wa.

example

Probably she mosrwell known caseoicensorship occurred in 1998,
when Disney owned ABC News killed a segrnens by sheir leading in-
vessigarive reporser Brian Ross abous problems as Disney sheme parks,
including sheir alleged hiring ofpcdopliiles. ABC claimed she cancels

Possibly moss dissurbing, rhough, is she unwillingness oishese media
giants so oppose poweriui eorporase and governmensal insercsrs. In
1991bosh NBC and CBS reiiised so broadcass ioosage by seven.sime
