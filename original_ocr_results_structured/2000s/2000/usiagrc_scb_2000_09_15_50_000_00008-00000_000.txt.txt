The greatest threat to self-governance is SGA

i love sclfegovernance and rhe open eurrieulum. i love rhe
idea orliving in a plaee where respeer is basic, eommuniearion
is expected, and responsibiliry forselfmd eommuniry is a realiry,
nor an absrraerion. For rhe mosr parr, Grinnell lives up ro irs
ideals The raeulry, residential-life srair. seeuriry force, and
adminisrrarion often demonsrrare supporr for rhe open
eurrieulum and self-governance rhar goes deeper rhan mere
roleranee. Sadly, rhe grearesr rhrears ro selrgovernanee have
some from our own Student GovernmenrAssoeiarion. Lasr year
several people, ineluding myself. broughr up eonrerns abour
SGA. Among rhe oomplainrs raised was ihar SGA seemed ro
value its own aurhoriry over rhe values ofsclfvgovcmancc and
Communiuriona Now srudenrs are raising similar
eomplainrs abour SGA’: handling or rhe reeenr
senaror eleerions. ln parrioular, rhe Rawxon and
Loose eleouons offer valuable eomparison.

Rawson eame up wirh a rie vore in irs eleeuon.
The Eleerion Board deeided rhar by sunday
eaeh eandidare should submrr an essay
erplaining rheir senarorial elualrriearions
ro sean Hammer and George Carroll,
eiung rhe SGA consrirurion as
jusriﬁearion. The consrlrurion seares rhar
rhe Presidenr and vieeepresidenr shall
appoinr a senaror ir“rhe eonsrirueney fails ro eleer a senaror,"
ln rhe end, rhe eandidares ralked amnngsr rhemselves and one
orrhem dropped our.

The Loose eleerion was full ofeonrusion some people
showed up lare, ineluding several eandidares, Ar rhe beginning
orrhe eleerion, Adminisrrarive coordinaroriim Dinncrvillc rold
people rlrar rhey should remain in rhe lounge in ease rhere was
a run-off. And indeed, no rwo sandidares won rhe firsr eleerion.
Unrorrunarely, mosr people had left rhe lounge. Those who
remained were warehing rho MTV Musie Awards. some people
later elaimed rhar rhey dldn’t hear abour rhe runsoffposslbiliry.
Wharever rhe reasons, rhe end resulrwas a mosrly empry lounge.
Alarmed ar rhe small number orLoose residenrs presenr, some
people reouesred rhar rhe runofrbe held rhe next day or over
email, when a more represenrarive sample or residenrs eould
vore. Jim Dinnerville refused to eonsider any delay eiring an
SGA rule requiring rhar senarors be eleered wirhin rwo weeks
of rho srarr of rhe sehool year. Two Loose eandidares rhen

requested permission ro rell residenrs who had walked away ro
rerurn if rhey wanied ro vore in the runoff. Concerns abour
gerrymandering were raised by some, including D'mnerville.
He relueranrly agreed ro allow people ro go spread rhe word.
He deeided ihar when rhe lasr person eurrenrly in rhe lounge
had easr a ballor, ehe eleerion would be over. A few minures
larer, rhe people in rhe lounge had all voeed. Soon rhcrcafrcr, ar
lam halfa dozen srudenrs showed up from rhe hallways ro
vore, many oir‘hein firsr.years. Dinnerville refused ro lor rhem
as! a ballor, relling rhem rhey eouldn'r vore beeause ehe eleerion
was over.

The solurions devised for borh ofrhese
siruarions are disrurbingly similar. in borh
eases, SGA asred ro rake power away from
rhe larger srudenr body and elaim ir for SGA.

By inrerprering rhe rie vore as a failure,
rhe Eleerion Board removed eleeiion power
from Rawson residenrs. IfSGA values selfe

governanee, an eliminauon
orsrudenr ehoiee should
be handled carefully
and eonservarively.
The people anaered by
rhe deeision should be
eonsulred. Borh Rawson sandidares would
have preferred anorlrer Rawson vore rariaer
rhan an appoinrmenr. Mike Shapiro, rhe new
Rawson senaior, did nor see rhe eleerion as a failure bur as a
sign rhar ar ihar poinr, Rawson liked borh eandidares equally
well. He ihoughr ehar irgiven anorher ehauee ro vore, Rawson
residenrs probably would have made a decision. The Election
Board eould have inrerprered rhe rie vore as a delay, rarher rhan
as a failure, and allowed anorher vore, Bur rhe Eleerion Board
did nor eonsulr rhe eandidaros or residenrs from Rawson when
rhey made rheir deeision. Anorher Rawson vore would have
been no less oonsriruiional rhan rhe appoinrmenr deoision, sinee
eirher way rhe twoewcck rule had been violated, And no marrer
how you argue whar a rie vore means, ir is obvious rhar
eommuniearion wirh Rawson residenrs would have upheld rhe
values or self-governance and demoeiaey more rhan rhe parh
rhe Eleerion Board ehose.

The larger problem
here is that when
SGA’s leadership was
faced with adversity,
they consistently
interpreted SGA’s rules
to disenfranchise the-
larger student body.

nin-offwould have been rhe violauon ofan SGA rule. This
nor a rrirling marrer, bur ihe senaeors would have been elecred
in rimerorsnnday's rrainingand Wednesdays ﬁreroinr Board
meering. undoubredly, rhe rule was rreared in rhe ﬁrst plaee ro
insure rhe rimely assemblage of a represenrarive body While
rhe rule irselrwonldhave been violared, rhe rule’s purpose would
nor have been eorripromised. However, rhe Admiiiisrrarive
Coordinator deeided ro follow rhis rule ro rlre absolure lerrer,
and rhereby eleered senarors from a small pool ofvotcrs and
negared rhe wishes ofrhc Loose residenrs who requesred a delay.
He also used a rule orhis own erearion ro rurn away srudenrs
who waneed ro vore.

The goal orselregovernanee is re empower
srudenrs. in Rawson, the Eleouon Board gave
power ro the Presidenr and VicerPresidenr by
taking power away from Rawson residenrs. ln
Loose, rhe Adminisrrarive coordinaror gave
power ro himselfby aking power away from
Loose residenrs. Thi s a eurious form orselr.
governanee, The worsr parr is, rhis power grab
was probably nor malieions. Maliee would be
much easier ro handle. The mishandling orrhe
momenr was mosr likely a knee.jerk reaerien
sreinming from SGA’: habirual praeiiee or
valuing irs aurhoriry over rhe more egalnarian
values oiselhgovernanee.

Proeedural problems led ro rhe dimeulr
siruarions in rhese dorms. For insranee, holding rhe eleerion
on rhe lasr possible day was unwise. SGA will probably add
bylaws and ainendinenrs so help prevenr ihese parrieular

~ problems from happening again. That's good, but nobody has

ever douhied saws abiliry ro pass bylaws. The larger problem
here is rhar when SGA’s leadershiprwas {aeed wirh adversiry,
rhey eonsisrenrly inrerprered SGA’s rules ro disenimnehise rhe
larger srudenr body. Such disregard for selragovernanre
eonsrirures aerisis orspirir. No marrerhow many bylaws SGA
purs on rhe books, rhere will be rimes when SGA will raee
uneerrainry and adversiry In rhese siruarions, SGAshould srrive
ro proreer and exemplify rhe values ofself-govcmancc. Whar
we’ve seen in reeenr rimes is exaerly rhe opposire. Perhaps whar
SGA needs more rhan anyrhing is a deep and rhorough re.
evaluarion orirs values and purpose.
