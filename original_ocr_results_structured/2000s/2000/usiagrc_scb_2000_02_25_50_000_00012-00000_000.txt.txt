Where have all the women gone?

By Tor Jansen
Staff Columnist

Have you noticed tliar everyone run.
ning in tire SGA elections is male? As a
man, I must admit I am somewbat anx—
ious about addressing rliis issue, because
I don’t know what it’s like to be a
woman. I ask that you near me our any»
Way, as a man wlio doesn't like the via

I’m disturbed. Women make up
something like 60% of tbe Grinnell
population. My experience with campus
groups has been rbar women outnum-
ber men at least 2 to l as active mem-
bers. And my impression (perbaps false)
is that women liere are more likely ilian
men to possess a commitment to elrang.

ing rlie world rarber than just proﬁting
from it. you migbt tliink, rlien, that
women would be more likely than men
to pursue elected ofﬁce. You migbr ex»
peer that many women would envision
tlie ofﬁce of President or VP as a means
oicbanging ibis college for the better.
Yet no women are running {or SGA

I think rliere are good reasons to nor
run {or SGA omee, particularly for
women. Crinnell student polities seem
overstuffed witb stereotypieal macho
posturing. starements such as “I get siiit
done, “I will riglrr hard," “I am nor afraid
of tire trustees,” and “I won’t wuss out
on you" abound in tlie literature orour
current presidential candidates. You'd

I think it’s elear tliat student politics
here at Grinnell need reform. Let‘s face
it, SGA is often unappealing. sometimes
the testostometer goes off the cbarr at
Joint Board. Egos come before civility.
Insults and intimidation are rite l cer—
tainly can't blame women or men for be-
ing turned offby rliat (although it’s not
as ifa woman lias never dished out an

say tliat we need women to have a ”civi-
lizing” inﬂuence on SGA. Reform of
SGA “culture,” ifl can use rliar term, is
everyone‘s responsibility. Everyone. Ina

50 women, wiieee are you?

Wlirir really disturbs me is rbat tliis
pbenomenon ofwomen running services
and ”do»good" organizations while men
dominare politics is nothing new. The
following isaquore from tire 1966 Gritt-
nell yearbook: “Women’s bouse meerings
are eonduered in a more purposeful
manner rban rbe boys and are far better
attended. The majority orsrudenrs en»

Vietnam protest, and otber social con—
cerns at Grinnell are women."

Moreover, in rbe past deeade men
have outnumbered women 3:1 as
presidential candidates and 2:1 as
vice-presidential eandidares. Women
have been better “citizens” than men
fox a long time, yet women are still
unlikely to be our leaders. This isn’t
just rlie ease ar Grinnell, but in our
soeiery generally.

We eerrainly do not live in a gen.
dereequal soeiery. And I suspect that
many women are turned on by rbe
orren combative brand of politics
practiced on this campus and else.
where. However, l do not believe the

oppression is so bad (at least on this
campus) that women are not running
for fear that a woman Cannot be
elected. Indeed, were a well qualiﬁed
woman to start a write in campaign
for president this year (hint-hint), I
believe she would do quite well.

I suspect that the problem comes
down to avoidance ofan unappealing
situation. he not just repression. Its
not just socialization. It's not just
women deciding that they can get
more done in campus groups than in
SGA. It's also that women seem all too
willing to leave the nasty work ofpoli-
tics to men.

Women may feel alienated by SGA
or repulsed by visions of old white
leclters groping their way through the
halls of Congress. However, women
cannot allow themselves to be re-
pressed by these things forever. If
you're not willing to work for change
here, while you’re young and idealise
tie and energetic. when will you ever
do it?

My vision ofltell is that somedayl
will have a daughter and she will never
see a woman elected President of the
United States. She will never see a
Congress where men do not outnum-
ber women. And why? Not because
women can’t get elected, but because
they aren’t even running.
