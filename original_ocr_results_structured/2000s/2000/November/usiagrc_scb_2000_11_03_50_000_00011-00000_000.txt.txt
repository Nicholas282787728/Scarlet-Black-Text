Carmel pecan crunch

There simply aren‘t enough leaves on campus.
Based on recent weather, i feel we should skip winter
and enjoy a thick layer of leaves until spring. Ah,
springl Do you ever come soon enough? Alas, until
then I treasure the transcendental fall, thoughts of
winter’s snow cones, hot cocoa and, of course, Plans,
Plans are wonderful, much like heroins' highly concen
trated fun until you realize you've missed all today’s
classes, you forgot to turn in yous ten-page research
paper on the breeding habits of chia»pets, and you're
looking with anticipatian to fall break. 1 walk out of
my room and find the two sides of my floor at war
with each other. i hope my side vn'ns. Ritalin is easy,
Ritalin is good, but willI eyes get the hang of it? And
why does French have to be so fareign?

Laundry chip, anyone?

on the joys of laundry day that day when rwakc
up and realize that the only clean clothes 1 have left
are sweatpants, mismatched socks, and the hideous
shirt that my aunt gave me last Christmas. After
hightailing it to the nearest machines with my induse
trial-size laundry bag, 1 find that, of the eight wash.
ers provided, three are full and four have chips stuck
in them (simple currency isn’t good enough for our
machines; apparently, one must buy little pieces of
plastic instead).

Half a box of Tide, two piles oi wet laundry conve-
niently left for me on top of the washers, and several
laundry chips later, i find that 1 no longer have my
favorite r-shirt, but i do have someone else's socks.
Ah, yes, laundry day. which reminds me- i have a few
loads waiting. Anyone have a laundry chip?

Not the icing on the cake

I'm tempted to do an anti-rant about the way the
air smells after it rains, the parallel lays the breakfast
sun makes at Cowles, salad cabbage in spicy tofu, or
mud puddles in Mac Field or any numbEr of the lovely
things which make up the icing on this grand Grinnell
take, but I think 1 have to say something not 50
positive about the tornado warning system, Today I,
like everyone else on campus, I had received an email
entitled ”TornadO'Watch In Effect." Needless to say, I
freaked out, ran into my SA’S room, who lives down-
Stairs. Turns out, tornado watthes do not imply a
necessity to be underground, while a tornado warn-
ing means a tornado is actually coming and you bet»
tar get the heck inside. A tiny semantic distinction
which can cause much confusion and panic. Fix it!
Pretty please!
