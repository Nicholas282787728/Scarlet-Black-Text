Opinion diverSIty
A response to campus criticisms

Shannon Anderson advocates a “strengthening or libeial
values," as w:ll n5 “valuing dlvcrslty." We agree that this necds
to happen, however, the right to freedom orspeech must be
respected The diversity oropinions is the true goal ordiversity
and to do anything to censor people's opinions would be dcrrl-
mental and worrisome to anyone who has liberal ide. is and val.
ues diversity. The preservation or the diversity of thought is
difﬁcult to maintain without offending anyone, but “Divcrslty
ll," written by Prcsidenl Russell K. Osgood andJonhthnn Brand
Esq, defends all beliefs, cven those which are offensive. We
apologize to those we offended, especially to those that felt
threatened, but we stand by our right to express our opinions.

In response

To Ms. Durand, Mr. Gable, Mr. Campbell, Mr. McGraw, and
the readers or the scar/crime! Barr:

I wish first to address a letter printed by Michelle P Durand
some weeks back (oct. 13), in which she criticized the eco.
nomic understanding or my colleague, roe Grim Feinberg.

Durand has called into question the two major premises
ormy colleague's article: that comperirion resolves itselrin cone
solidarion, and that consumerism is an inherent rcaturc ofczlplv
talism.

About the first, she claims rhar competition does notlead
to consolidation, uniformity, and monopoly; instead, “compe—
tition is the market force that PROHIBITS monopoly and
uniformity" (capitals in original). I could counrvolumes ofcvl-
dencc to my colleagues side, but asinglc name should sufﬁce:
standard Oil. 1 had thought that John D. Rockefeller proved
my colleagues point a century ago, and l am rather surprised
that there remains any need to revive the argument today.

Next, Durand criticlzcs Giim Feinberg's claiiri that capie
talism needs people ro feel their checkbooks constrained in an
economy orscarcity l recognize that my colleague left out some
steps in his thinking process, and perhaps it is bar this reason
that his point was not appreciated Due to spinal constraints, I
will respond now only in general terms Blltl refer anyone in.
retested in seeing a more complete formulation or the argu.
ment to a hopefully—soon.to.be.printed article in the F/IItE/Ir/n
nrircs.

lsee rour distinct levels at which capitalism, of necessity,
promotes consumerism, which in turn creates an economy of
scarcity and constrained cheekbooks

First, as any introductory economics text will state, either
explicitly or implicitly, mainstream economics studies the allo.
cation ofrcarce resources, lithe people in an economy feel they
have access to all the resources they want, the laws or supply
and demand do not hold true.

second, capitalism must not allow production to exceed
consumption. ltan economy cannot sell all it produces, a re.
cession or depression results.

Third, in a competitive neoclassical system, such as that
extolled by Durand in her letter, we havc learned that there

our criticism.

We mcognne what is wrong, and we seek to change it

1 will respond, now, to Erik Gable, whose little piece or
sarcasm and wit appeared in the 5dr; two weeks ago, and to
“Alan Campbell independent scholar, ' whose eloquent verses
cairie to the public last week I have only this to say.

My colleague and l are sorry that some readers are troubled
by our audacious contention that art is better (nor not differ.
cnt) when produced by independent humans, rather than, {or
example, capitol Records.

This contention says nothing about the erudition, intelli-
gence, or wit orcrim reinberg; ir states merely that our entire
society would beneﬁt from shunning Christina Aguilcra and
her ilk, and from spending time with anything that is more
positively meaningful. ln that my colleague pretends to have a
solid opinion. perhaps that makes him pretentious. So be it.
We are quite sorry that Grim Fclnbcrg's ideas have disturbed
Gable and Campbell so, but plry does not converse with truth,
and neither cable's humility nor Campbell’s vulgarity will make
us admit that whatever they do is, after all, okay.

One ﬁnal note should be made on this issue: the words
“higher and more lnnzlllgenr arts," which Gable cited in order
to makc Grim Felnbcrg appear haughty and elitist, were in fact
used in my Colleague's original article in order to mimic the
kind or language often used by his critics—critics who place
such words in his mouth in their own attempts to expose his
elitism, lrthis was not clear in the original article, we are sorry.

i would, finally, like to thank Greg Mccraw, whose lctrer
appears in this current issue, for reasonably and respectfully
expressing his disagreement. we may continue in peace to dis.
agree His view, 1 am sure isacoininon onein this mt broken
country, and we do not expect to topple it in a single week.
What is “currently feasible," after all, is not at issue. AI issue is
a vision ota better place, transformed after being torn up by its
roots and reestablished in better soil.

That said, 1 will continue to work with Grim Feinherg in
the rurure and push him to make his articles more clear and
accessible For, while it is amusing to have people with whom
to argue in the letters to the editor section ofrliis newspaper,
our ultimate purpose is not to antagonize readers, but to win
ihem over to our side

Quite sincere/y,

Can't take the heat

I‘m sick of all this warm weather we've been
having lately. it's ridiculous. How can anyone be
expected to live like this? I swear, I’m melting, it's
never this hot in Canada, or even in Alaska! Maybe
they should close Quad, to avoid putting their poor
employees at risk of heat stroke,

1 propose we bring Canada to Grinnell, instead
or the reverse. What we really need is a nice, thick
layer ofsnow, and they've got plenty. I‘d say maybe
enough to go up to my chin, or at least up to my
waist. This would dehnitely provide the desperately
needed relief from this heat wave, as well as an
excellent excuse to be late ror class, or even to skip
class altogether. Just thinking about cooler weather
makes me want to go outside to study, but alas! l

1 would like to take issue with Mr Feiuberg’s article rc-
gaidiiig the evils orthe automobile

Firstly, cars are not ugly Beau. s noronly rhc sterile pure
suit of artists, it can be round cvcl'ywllcrc. To rind beauty in
architecture, or ninire, or the human body is to admit that
there can be bounty in the hincrioiinl. Since there is beauty in

Finally, a public transportation system to fully phase out
the car is not currently feasible. A public transportation is lim-
ited by what a private organization can make a pioht providing
or what taxpayers are willing to subsidize. Within these cone
anaints, service to rural areas like Grinnell, for example, would
be spotty at best because of the lack ora population base to
.usriry it. Also, there are people whose needs cannot be served
by public tiansportation, People who need to transport their
own equipment to and from work and people who fraqucmly
need transportation on an emergency basis are among rhe many
who will always need some form or personal vehicle. should
we restrict licences and registrations to them alone, when the
privilege otdriving can be had by all without too much social
disruption.> Thar would be undemocratic.
