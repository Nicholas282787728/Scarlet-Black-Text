One of the things Tyler ostcrgaard will
remember most vividly about Grinntll is
long dinners in Quad,

“[Dlnner] lasted for hours and went
across a whole spectrum ofideas,”he said. “1
love that at Grinnell you can talk to anyone
about anything, and they always have an int
formed opinion.”

As a student advisor for two years, a
member ofJudicial Coun-
eil, and an SGA senator,
Ostergaard said the people
played the major part of his
Grinnell ctpcrience.

“People are so much a
part of Grinncll," Ostert
gaard said. “he enjoyed Grinnell because
there are great people around all the time,“

According to ostergaard, spending time
and making friends with such a unique group
ofpeople has made him think more critically
about himselfand the world.

Helping to preserve that unique commu-
nity has been important to ostergaard. At
the beginning or his senior year, he led the
sclfrgovernance program at New student
Orientation.

‘Last year the selr- -govemanec tallt was
really boring, Osterg' rd said, and I wanted
to make it a fun time. Its been gratifying
to see all the ﬂrsteyears using what thoyvc
learned"

governance during his time on student staff,
an experience hc described as his favorite at
Grinnell.

“I loved being an SA... getting to lmow
the staff and my ﬂoor," he said. "I miss the
intimacy ufbeing an SA. talking to everyone,
having tun and just being silly."

Some ot‘ his best moments. osttrgaard
said, were when he would return to his ﬂoor

late at night. “and everyone
. would be hanging out and talk-
< ingtogetliet."

For 0stcrgaard, fostering
that spirit or community made
his work as an S,A. successful.
but there was an aspect of silli-

ness to the job that he also enjoyed.

“I always loved playing ‘ride the ponyJI
will never forget the ﬁrst timc we played that
in Main."

Next year, osrergaard will take his appro
ciation of conﬂict resolution to a new level
as he works with mitigation specialist Caryn
Tatelli '92. He will also be learning French
as he prepares tor graduate school in art his-
tory, '

Though he has exciting plans tor his
future, ostcrgaard said that he will miss
Grinnell,

“I’m really sad to be leaving," he said. “I’ve
had great friendships, I’ve enjoyed my classes
and I've enjoyed being around such great
people. It will be sad to let that go,"
