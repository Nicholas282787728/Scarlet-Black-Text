School bans ﬂags

Flags, cont. from p. 1

At hrsr, Bohman said, hewas sympathetic, and assumed
she was only doing her job, unril this point, she had been
verysupporrive orhis and his roommates snuggle for rherr
righr to hang the ﬂag. But Bohman is now having soeond
thoughts. “The more i think About it, noneproﬁts make
politiml sraremenrs all rhe rimc," he said. “it seems like a
lirrle bir ora phony mason "

Asked to clarify rhe nonrproﬁl issue, l<rohn was vague.
”There are some isriios about non-proi‘irs and polirroil backa
mg as sraremenrs, and there may be a connection rhero,"
she said. “Does this boeorno this kind orsraremcnri I can’r
say clearly that ll: does, 1 can't say clearly that it doesn't "

Later in the interview, she added rhar rhe nonproﬁt
issue “may be r pieoe ofit," and rhat the collage does nor
warn ro pur rhe school's nonrproﬂt srans in jwparcly.

lfrhis is rrue, rhen Bohmari still has some quosrions.
“Ifshe was saying riiar we had ro take down rhr nag be
arise, as a politiml smtem:nt, ir chrerrened our nonprofit
starts, I don'r see why [rlie Norris pirates} would have ro
take down their ﬂag,” hc wondered “It wasn't a polltlml
statement at all. was it?"

Hashmall agrees. He feels that rhe new policy is "erro.
neous ,. Something hanging out ofono persons window
clearly represents rhe views or rhe person who lives at that
loution, not the college in general," he wroro in d January
email to Krohn. "I rhink there is a very low risk ora passer-
by observing my ﬂag and assuming rhar Grinneii College
is run by pints."

Kmhn’s request that Hashmall and Jones take down
the Jolly Roger came not so much out of 2 concern dial
outsiders would assume that she consider:d herselfz pk
rate, but, she explained, bemuse to ask Bohman to take
down the upsidedown us. nag, 2nd allow the pirare ﬂag
to remain, would be unfair. “We need to be consistent with
rho rhings rhar hang ourside." she said. ”Ifyou say ‘no' ro
one group and then ‘yes‘ to anorher group, ir doesn’t make
sense.

Jones and Hashrnall rhrnk rhis ratricrs studenrs' right
ro free expression, “The alrernarive... othanging rhe ﬂag
inside my window is unacceptable ro mc simply because I
live on the fourrh ﬂoor," wrote Hashmall in hlS email to
Krohn. “Moving the ﬂag inside would render it virtually
invisible.“

Krohn conronds our free speech “has to do wirh time,
place, and possession.” The college “wanrs srudenrs ro be
able to express rhemseives, bur we want them ro do irwirhin
riie paramerers orrree speech."

SPARC faces reform

As students go to the polls to select next year’s student publications and
radio committee, current members are revising the committee’s duties

by Brian Clites
Staff Writer

In 1998, the chair of the Student Publications and
Radio Committec (SPARC) msigned, citing overwork Jon
l’etltt ’Ol, rhen a sophomore, Sreppcd inro rho vacant posi-
non.

“Wllelil took over, 1 actualllywenl and found a ‘SPARC
box' that had been left by the former (lull at a flicnd's
apartmenr," Perrir said. The box served as SPARC‘s legacy.
handed down from chair to chair, and containing all the
notes and docummts from the previous years. Unfortue
nately, Puttit remembered, “there was not much in it."

The disrepair of the 1998 com»
mirreo led to widespread concern
among studrno and rdminisrrarors.
and President Russell Osgood 3p-
poinred a taskforcc ro srabilize and
improve rhe Committee.

The SPARC taskfnrce quickly
paged temporary changes to improve
rho eommirree, and m Saptembcr
1999. SPARC passedsevcial changes
ro irs bylaws based largely on the
taskforce’s recommendations. The
major changes in:lud:d increasing
the committee size to at least five
members and paying media heads direcrly from general
SPARC funds instead from their own publimtlons’ bud-

SPARC also breame on elected comminee, headed by
a business manager elected from wirhin rhe commirree.
Ulrimarely the rrskrorce envisioned two posirions: a busle
ness manager to run rhe day-roldnyaccciunting and a chair
in charge or d1c rommirree as a whole

currenrly, SPARC's organirarion bears closer rcsrm.
blance ro the way rhe taskroreo iorr ir in 1999, bur the
Committee is proposing a change for next year rhar would
move ir closer to Perrir’s descriprion.

This year rhe committee is composed or five elecred
members who divide rhe day-today SPARC obligarions
among themselves.

Jacob Kaufmanosborn ’04, rhe SPARC member cur»
rcntly in ehrrge or business marrers, described die rurrenr

"The problem with [the
current system] is that to

ment tasks, you need to be

sysrem as “horribly inomeienr " “You really need one per.
son to rim the business monagemenr,.. ii mrkes more
same," he said. “The problem with [rho currcnr iysreml is
rhri to do rhe business mrnagemcnr rasks, you need ro be
{L d "

Thc new SPARC proposal seeks ro srreanrimo the day-
ro.day dimes inro two hired business manager po<iriollx
while retaining the five—person elecrcd comrnnrce ro gov.
ern gonorsl SPARC policy Under rho proposal, rhe ﬁve
elecrod comminee members would solrer rnd hire r busi—
ness mrnager and assuram business manager to handle rlic
dayroday SPARC operations and budgcr.

Like rho SGA rrersurcr, oaeh
SPARC business manager would be
hired rora tweeyearposltion, so that
in his or her second year or dury
rlre arsisranr business manrgor
would aiiromrneaily become ihe
business manager. ensuring {halt-ye
cry year more is someone with e>te
periencr ro handle rhe posirion.

“The eomminee will iniinrsin
every bir ordroir power," said Scchyl
Laiu '04, another current SPARC
member. “with a commiriee, you
don't have a guaranree that rhere
will be someone who will know the budgrr processiyou
can'r guaranree rhar such a person will be elected."

The currenr committee has rriod ro avoid lerring rhr
business manager also be rhe hcud orspiutc. “I Want a
sepanrion or powers benveon the rreasurer and rho come

in the commiiree. We don’r know how .r will acrually nine
tron unril ir's pur .nro aerion, birr I think everyrhing will
turn our fine."

These goals are very similar ro those originally proe
posed by rho 1999 raskrorce, “We didn't want ro necessar.
ily change SPARC from one person handling the day—ro
day deraiis," ssid panic “We gave more responsibility ro
the committee members so that rheir posirions were ime
porranrandworrhwhiie, It looks like now [our plan} is
srarring to berome a grown—up."
