Solidarity forms' In response to student
arrest and communications breakdown

av ALY BEERY

A new batch ofposters appeared on
campus Monday with messages such
as, “Your fellow students arc not terrors
isls."

The signs was posted by members
of Grinncllians for Solidarity, or, simply
“Solid."

Cassie Donnelly ‘06, a member and
organizer of ihe group, said rhar Solid
intends to address “basic problems of
trust and communication" among stu-
dents as well :Is bcrwccn the adminis
[ration and studentsThc group is also
concerned about “administrative trans-
parcncy,” which Donnclly described as
“whal’s going on up rhcrc, what are rhc
reasons for it,"

While the group originally came
together after the arrest of Paul Waili-
righr ‘07, mcmbcrs said ihc need was
apparent prior to (he incidenr. “Paul's
situation is just a very large example
of a lot of small ploblcms that have

on campus," said Donnelly. somc or
the situations sh: referenced were the
smoking ban. niiunn increases. alcohol
policy and drug arrcsxs,

The group, according to Sam lungs
‘05, is nor meant to be a “talk-oriented
urgaiiiznrion”oiie rhar "creates an curlcr
for students frustrations, so they don't
feel like us impotent and it’s not en,
tirely kneejerk reaclions." He said that,
in the pasr, students frustrated wilh
campus events or policies prolcsr but
“haven't made demands or put prev
sure on the administration" that lead to
changes.

This weekend is an Admitted Stu—
dcniVl/cekcnd during which more than
a hundred admirred siudcnls, along wirh
their families, will visit the college. Sole
id plans to hold a sit-in today, starting
on Mac Field at 11 a.m. and eventually
moving to rhc John Chrystal Center,

said Donnelly. She said that members
want to engage in dialogue with pros-
pies and parenls about issues they feel
the college could improve on, bur rhc
goal is nor in discourage students from
enrolling ar Grinncll,

In addition to Fridays events, the
group plans to sponsor an all-cam-
pus cnnccrr featuring student hands
and DJs, contact alumni and continue
postcring on campus.

“Even if the only outcome of this
Is an amellomlion of campus attitude,
that would be an accomplislimcnt,”said
Greg Chatterley ‘06. “We don't ncccss
sarily have to get hundreds of policy
changes or admissions from the admin-
isrralion about what really happened,
what we really need to write as a stun
dent body and be able to affect some
reasonable change,just through our ate
lirudes.”

Paul Wainright ‘07 was charged for Threat of Ter-
ron'sm under Iowa Code 708A.5, which states, "A

Students like Donnelly and Greg Chatterley ‘06 feel than rlic
circumstances surrounding Wainnghl’s arrest and other recent lnClT

Wainright had posted this message on his Plan:
DEAR STUDENTS: as a responsibility to your fellow
student body, please come back to school armed with
whatever lethal weapon you have access to, If we can’t
depend upon the administration to protect the bubble
we were promissed and that they are selling us for
34,000 goddamn dollars a year, then we will have to
take matters into our own hands. That means violence
and bloodshed. That means warfare. That means KILL
