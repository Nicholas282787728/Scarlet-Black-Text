Grill employee, Ashton Kutcher’s ex

BVNAJMA OSMANN

lfyou spend as much time in the Grill as the average Grinr
neliian does, you have probably seen the friendly face ofNicole
Berry behind the counter, As one of the Spencer Grill’s manag-
ers and part ofthe staffat the Honor G Grill in the dining hall,
Berry has seen it allithc good, the bad and the drunken.

The 29ryearrold has done a lot with her Lifetime, from be—
coming a seasoned bartender to being a mom ofthree: 6—year
old son Jacob, 5-year-old daughter Taylor, 22emontheo1d son
Grifﬁn, and she is due with another child in May. She wants to
be surprised, so she hasn’t found out the sex ofthe baby

However, before marriage and children, Berry briefly dated
Ashton Kutcher in high schoolThough Kutchcr is a celebrity,
Berry in nonchalant about it. “Yeah, we went to a few parties
together," she said, “He went to a high school nearby and he
was cool."

Berry has spent about to years working in various restau-
rants while also raising her three—soon to he four—children.
But what brought Berry to Grinnell about one year ago was the
promise of full—time employment, benefits for her family, and
scheduling that allowed either her or her husband to be with
their kids

Though working for Dining services has all these benefits,
Berrys favorite aspects of her job is interacting with Grinnell
students. 1 really enjoy their perspectives, she said I feel like
I learn a lot from them, as well teach them too."

Having now experienced a year's worth of crazy weekend
nights, Nicole has seen some pretty outrageous Grinnellian
antics, both intoxicated and sober, “Someone just ran into the
Grill and peed in the corncrl" Berry said. “Another time, some
nauseous girl ran in to the Grill and aimed at the trash can, but

ended up missing the [rashcanithough [she] ended up clean-
ing after herself."

As bizarre as these events may sound, Berry's favorite mo-
ment doesn't include student’s bodily ﬂuids. “The most outmr
geous thing though is when someone stole a whole candy rack
from the front counter, that thing was huge and had at least
so candy bars on it,” Berry said. “They were never caught! I’m
convinced it was a group effort," Nicole did mention that while
some things have gone missing, many students have come back
and paid for things they had taken.

Student burglaries dont Just limit themselves to the spen-
cer Grill. In the Dining Halls Honor G Grill, Nicole has seen
some unusual things as well Someone stole the blue light for
the blue light special—so strange,"slie said. Upon hearing that
there was a Grinnell rap group with the name Honor G, she
said, “no wonder they told us to guard those hats with Honor
G on them with our lives, those things apparently get stolen

uick."
q Students that know Berry share her positive opinion about
her relationship with students. “1 love working with Nicole ..
she’s smart, a hatdrworker, and she makes working at the Grill
fun,”said Spencer Grill employee Hiba Einour'iz. “She never
hesitates to give advice and make you laugh."

Her greganousness lends itseifto creating friendships with
notjust Grill student workers, but other students as well. Last
semester, while her husband was on the cdge of his seat watch-
ing his favorite team the Philadelphia Plullies take the World
Series by storm, Berry recieved updates on the game from Anr
tonic Woods'lO. "She noticed my Phillies hat when I came into
the Grill, and we talked about our mutual love ofthe team,"he
said. “She's really cool.”

From pig-slaughtering delinquent to Silicon Valley tycoon

hi'JEFr RADEKSTRONG

Not many people know much about Bob
Noyce,despitc his accomplishments.Hisobitu—
aries paint him as a person unappreciated in his
time, but someone who made a difference any-
ways. New York Times columnist Tom Fried-
man, in his column
after Noyce’s death,
writes about a col-
league who remarked,
“This guy [Noyce] was
really amaztng. How
eomeI had never heard
of him?" Another journalist, Michael Malone
of the San Jose Mercury News, said Noyce
was siighted from not only the Nobel Prize in
Physics, but also the Nobel Prize in Peace.

But in Grinnell, the Noyce science center
remains a clear monument to the man most eas
ily known for inventing the integrated circuit, or
the ”microchip,” as it is commonly called. Few
Grinnellians graduate before learning this, or of

 

the legendary stoty about how he narrowly es-
caped expulsion after slaughtering a pig in Clark
HallThough both are time, they don’t fully grasp
Noyces impact on Grinnell and thc world.
Born' in Burlington, Iowa, in 1927, his family
moved to Grinnell in 1937 after his father took
a position in the Iowa Cour
fereaee of Congregational
Churches. He spent his
childhood building airplane
‘ models. eventually building
one big enough to achieve a
brief30 second flight
He graduated from Grinnell High school as
Villet‘lictotian and with a reputation as “the guy
who has the answers to all the questions,"aceordr
ing to the school yearbook. Noyce also sang in
musicals and swam throughout high school. He
would remain a singer and a competitive diver at
Grinnell College, where he won the state diving
championship.
After graduating, Noyce went to MIT, grad-

uating with a PhD. in physics in 1953, After
working brieﬂy on the East Coast, he moved to
California to walk at Schockley Semiconductor
with seven other young microelectronic geniuscs.
Noyce and the other seven would soon leave
Sciiockley due to infighting with their boss, a
move that branded them the “Traitorous Eight."

Thcso eightweut on to form Faiichild Semir
conductor in 1957. At Faircliild, Noyce pioneered
his concept of manufacturing transistors out of
silicon, laying the groundwork for the industry
that would give birth to Silicon Valley Then, in
1958, Noyce developed the ﬁrst microchip made
of silicon. (Previous prototypes existed, mak-
ing Noyce a “coeiuvcntorﬂbut the use of silicon
made Noyce's version easier to produce.) With
it, Noyce catapulted into fortune and revolution~
izcd the world.

Noyce soon became known as the “The
Mayor ofSilicon Valley," and his legend spread,
“Engineers at archropponent Japanese firms
would reportedly not wash their rights hands for

days after shaking Noyce's hand," wrote Ma-
lone in Noyce's obituary

But Noyce's impact was not limited to just
the microchip. the management style helped
revolutioiuze the technology industry and
breed new ideas that spurred further innovar
tion. Noyce let his employees “take their own
lead, allowed their eccentricitics (and with it
their strengths) to emerge and cschewed Lhe
rigid East Coast organizational style,"said Ma-
lone, who interviewed Noyce several times over
the Course of his Life.

Even though many do not know much
about Noyce's life, everyone can see the impact
of his invention on the world. As Malone put
it, the libraries ofkings and resources ofgianr
institutions now sit on the desk of a poor stu-
dent in Nairobi"

Noyce becamea Grinnell college trustee
in 1962 and served as chair from 1966- 70. He
died of a heart attack on June 3, 1990 at the
age of 52.
