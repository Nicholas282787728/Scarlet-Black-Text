Iowa agriculture wasn’t always corn and soybeans -

The agriculture on the tallgrass prairie before colonization and indulstrialism was vastly different from what exists here now

When I first proposed this column, I didn‘t intend for it to
be an overview of the history of Iowa. However, I've found that
in order to begin writing about contemporary topics,I feel the
need to go back through a lot of history in order to establish
a basis to talk about the present. So in this
column and in my next one, I’m going to talk
about how the agriculture of the area devel-
oped, so that I can then start to talk about
why agriculture is what it is today.

We all found out soon after coming to
Iowa—for natives it’s been lifelong knole
edgrrhat there are pretty much two crops
here: corn and soybeans. If we only imagine
the Iowa landscape as once covered by tall-
grass prairie and now covered by corn and
soybeans and dominated by industrial agrir
culture, we miss a whole intermediate step
in the history ofthis place and the evolution of agriculnire in
Iowa In addition, we miss the very interesting origins of those
two now ubiquitous and seemingly resident crops, corn and
soybeans, which have only been grown in their present range in
Iowa for 70 years or so. However boring or timeless the present
crop rotation might seem to us, it is actually quite unique and
ephemeral when looked at from the longer history of this place
and the people who have lived here.

Before white Europeans and Americans brought forged
steel plows that could break through the tough roots and thick,
sticky soil that characterized the prairie uplands, agriculture in
Iowa was confined to the loose soils of lowrlylng floodplains
along rivers, which could be planted without the aid of plows
or animal draft power. It was in these places that Ioway Indie

It can be sure
prising to learn
about indigenous
agriculture in Iowa,
especially when
many representations ofNativc Americans on
the Great Plains are fixated on an image of
the primitive, nomadic hunter. It is true that
the Ioway were hunters too, cultivated crops
were only part ofa variety offood sources ins
eluding wild gtune like bison, elk, deer and turkey, wild plants
like acorns and hazelnuts, maple syrup from sugar maples and
fish from the rivers in the spring. Garden sites were only oc—
cupied part of the year as groups moved with the seasons and
their food sources, Because the upland, interior prairiciplaces
like where Grinnell is today—could not be farmed by Native
Americans and were used mainly for hunting, they remained
“unsettled."

The people who settled the prairie were white Americans
and Europeans who brought the steel plows and animal draft
power necessary to break the pranie sod and begin farming the
rich, exposed soil. While contact between whites and Native
Americans had first occurred in the late loOOs,whites only be-
gan to settle in Iowa in the 1830s and 1840s, after the United

BECOMING NATIVE

States government had forcibly dispossessed many Native
Americans of their right to the land through wars and trea—
ties. Because whites had plows and draft power and because
they were entirely dependent on agriculture for their food, their

farms were much bigger than indige-

nous dens—their farms were over
RDAN a hungizd acres each, while the Ioway
farms had been just a few acres.They
grew corn like Native Americans did,
but they also grew European crops
like oats and wheat. They kept pas-
tures for grazing and for hay In addir
tion to oxen—and later draft horses which eventually replaced
oxen as the most important source of animal powerithey had
dairy cows, pigs and chickens. They also had large vegetable
gardens and grew lots of potatoes. Over the years farms grew
in size as more crops were raised for market rather thanjust for
home consumptionThis increase in size was limited, thoughi
farms could only get so big and still be manageable with only
human and animal labor to harness,

These farmers and their lifestyle should not be idealized.
After the Civil War many farmers exhausted their soils growing
wheat because ofa boom in wheat pricesisome of the nicer
houses in Grinnell are a product of this “wheat boom"~but
then the prices bottomed out and pests destroyed whole wheat
crops, The point is that for many years after white settlement
a very different agriculture from the one that exists today was
practiced. Farms were diversiﬁed and most of what they pros
duced was for home consumption, In my next column I will
talk about the great change that came about in the 20th cent
tuty, the change that led to the agriculture we know today,

Homophobia exists on campus

Over the past several Weeks, there have
been more reports or homophobic incidents
on campus than we’ve been aware of in re-
cent years. This trend is troublang, not only
because it is an embodiment of oppression
against queer members ofour community, but
also because some students do not see the It“:
cent events as cause for alarm.These events on
campus involving offensive, injurious language
on whiteboards, door decs, and spoken com-
ments, do not qualify as hate ctirnes per se, yet
they do constitute a disturbing act of hatred
and hate speech, even if the target of these
comments does not identify as a queer person.

Words such as "faggot," "cocksucker,"
“dyke,” “homo," etc. have histories of hatred,
oppression and discrimination against those
that identify as LGBTQIA, Writing words
like this on your buddy’s white board or jok-
ingly calling a friend “faggot" perpetuates and
keeps alive the historic discrimination of queer
people. The simple act of using these words as
an act ofteasmg has unintended consequences.
For instance, words scrawled on a white board
that were only meant as a joke to a friend are
still offensive and examples of homophobic
speech. People never know the audience that
will see or hear this kind of language. So, it
could be funny to call someone a "cocksucker,"
but imagine what that might mean to someone
questioning their sexuality This word might
make a person less comfortable to come out of
the closet because they hear hate speech spot

ken in such an intentioned manner.

As an institution and as a residential col—
lege, Grinncll commits itself to maintaining
a welcome and queerefriendly environment.
Unfortunately, some dorms or other spaces
on campus are not commonly thought of as
safe spaces for queer people. Why do we have
to hang up fliers that say “queer safe space"
when technically, the whole campus should
be thought ofas a safe space? The events over
the last few weeks, primarily taking place in
Rathje Hall, have been explained away as
typical of that particular dormitory. This ex-
cuse ﬂies in the face of what Grinnell stands
for as an institution. Rathje should be no less
safe than Loose Hall. It should be no less safe
than Clark, or the PEC, or Darby, or Herrick
Chapel.

On Sunday night, a group ofover 30 stun
dents assembled in the Stonewall Resource
Center to address issues of homophobia on
campus. As a group, we made posters and signs
that we put all over Rathjo Hall to reclaim it as
a safe space for all students on campus. It may
seem an inappropriate response to words that
were probably written by a small number of
students on campus However, we as a group
felt that any expression of homophobia is
worthy of reaction, How far should we let ho-
mophobia exist before it escalates into physical
acts of violence against those that identify as
queer?

This is our school, and as students come
mitted to diversity we all have the duty to ups

hold the core values of the institution. Because
Grinnellians have committed themselves to
celebrating diversity, no act of homophobia is
too small to combat. Furthermore, we as stur
dents believe that this opposition to oppression
extends to combating racism, classism, sexism,
xenophobia, ablerbodyism, trans-phobia and
differences in political ideology. This list of
diversity does not include those that openly
express hate or close-mindedncss. ln all,acts of
hate speech are unwelcome on our campus, and
the events of the last few weeks only remind us
as socially conscious students that there is work
to be done.We appreciate the support we have
received from Student Affairs, and we implore
everyone on campus to challenge acts of op—
pression and discrimination, because as a self-
governing institution, it is up to students to
create safe space on campus for all individuals.

We should not be complacent

Dear Griuuell,

There are issues on this campus that do
mand discussion and actions that need to be
put in their proper perspectives.

As many know, incidents ofhatied directed
toward queer students have transpired over the
past several weeks. This past weekend, I was
glad to see discussion otthese incidents spread.
However, among the larger campus commu
nity, I have yet to see evidence of true outrage.

Let this be clear: derogtory slurs were writ-
ten on Whiteboards and in blatandy public
places; individuals degraded and attacked the
queer community on this campus. And yet,
too many people appear complacent. In fact,
I recently watched a discussion among stu—
dents ttail off into a debate about appropri-
ate levels of response and word choice while
a strong resolution condemning these types of
actions sat idly in front of them. Is this really
the treatment this issue receives here? Are we
truly worried about overreacring to an unpro-
voked vilificution of our fellow students’ Life-
styles? This is not sortie minor issue of sett-
governance, resolvable between those acting
and those affected; this is a breach of contract
between those acting and the entire campus.

or am i wrong? Perhaps passiveness is the
true reaction among the majority ofstuclents.
Perhaps we do live within a campus where de-
rogatory slurs such as nm-r, sp'c or k’ke are
considered relatively harmless and permissible.
And for those who will try to draw a distinCr
tion, know that there is no difference between
a word like f‘gg‘t and the words above.

While I hope our campus isn’t that insen-
sitive, I'd like to end with a stanza from Mau-
rice Ogden’s poem “The Hangman" for those
who remain indecisive:

“For who has served nae more faithfully
Then you with your cowards hope?” said he,
“Andwhere are theothers that mighthave stood
Side by your side in the common good?"
