Stovepipe brings Iraq war 'to mainstage

BY DARWIN CYPHERS MANNING

Grinnell’s theatrical performances are in full force this
semester from Shakespeare's vaguely gender bending, seven~
teenth-ccntury “As You Like it" to a politically charged inter-
active piece opening nextweek.

“The ﬁrst show will be stovcpipe, which is about private
security contractors following the liaq war,” Lesley Delmonico,
director and Theater department chair, said,“\’Ve will be Show
ing the us premiere, [Stovepipe] was produced in London
during dpril through June and 1 was teaching there, so I got
to see it.

The show not only marks a second premiere on the Grinnell
campus, but also imports international political themes. “1 am
excited because it’s a show that deals with issues in our own
\vorl hroughout campus we haven't talked that much about
the warm Iraq and what happens artenvards,"sard Delmonieo.
The story follows the stmggles ota soldier who sustained sub-
stantial psychological damage during the war and the struggles
of a private security contractor in trying to locate this soldier.

“The subject matter is very current and the story is very
powerful. I think that combination will really make it resonate
with viewers,"Malcom Scott’11,who plays one ofthree private
service contractors, said.

Aside from the play's relevancy, it is also eyeropening. Be
cause orhow heavily the US relied on outsourcing for soldieis,
private security contractors are relatively unique to the Iraq war.
Additionally, rhc majority of people can imagine the difficulty
of returning to society after the turmoil of war, but few can
imagine this at the intense level “Stovepipe” allows for.

In an effort to address the sociological and political iinplir
cations of the piece, Delmonrco has taken substantial steps to
insure notjust that the play is open to the entire Grinnell coma
munity, but also that it is highly interactive. “We have a fellow
in town who has spent time in Iraq [and he] is going to come
in and speak to us and another person is going to come in and
teach guys how to handle a gun,"Dclmonico said.

The tactile', active nature of the performance will also involve
a promenade requiring the audience move around throughout
the piece. As a result, the audience will be limited to 70 people,

“The production of Stovepipe is unique in that the au-
dience physically travels from space to space throughout the
playithcre is no single stage," Kevin Jennison '12, another prir
vate service contractor, said. “The actors are in very close quar—
ters— literally within reachiof audience members throughout

that includes ﬁve star hotel bars, seedy brothels and war-torn
desert landscapes.

so far the gravity ofthe subject matter has both inspired the
cast and brought them closer together.

“we’re already doing so great, I’m really looking forward
to how polished the show will be when we open," Scott said.

"Stovepipe" will open Oct. 8 at 7:30 p.m, run through Oct,
