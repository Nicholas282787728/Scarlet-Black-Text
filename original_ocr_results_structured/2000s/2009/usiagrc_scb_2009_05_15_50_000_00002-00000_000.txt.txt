When l<lumprrer transferred her junior

, cial work, bur rhe people
are whar made rhe differ-

As the ﬁrst bus ofvolunreers was leading up
to travel to Marshailtown, Klumpner received a
call from the supervisor informing her rhar the
event had been cancelled due to an outbreak of
Swine Flu,

“1r was demsring, we were expecting a re
ally good rumour," Klumprrer said. “The only
oprimisric way I can look as it is, looking to the
future we have already done all rlre puhllcity for
whenever this event wants ro happen again”

Though life after graduate school is a few
years down the road, Klumpner seems ro have

loans so I want to work at some institution first
wherher it be high school or eollcge,"l<lumprrer
said. “i evenrually see myself working adminis-
tration ar a nonproﬁt and rhen evenrually be-
coming a clinical psychologisr."
