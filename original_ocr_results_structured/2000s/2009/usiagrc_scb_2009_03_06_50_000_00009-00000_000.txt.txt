lhe dual iolcs of student ind pet ownel
challenge stndents to mnit n the health of
both tlicit animals and the relationships with
the humans sharing their living space. me
ing animals of questionable legitimacy sheds
light on how domesticated creatnres fit into
the wilds otcallege.

Despite the Student Handbook‘s regula—
tion that “cats are not allowed in the residence
halls," a number of students share their dorm
rooms with cats in a sometimes unexpected
living situation. “It was more of the fact that
the cat had been abandoned than the fact that
I actually wanted one," Alex Phillips ’12 said of
the kitten he found in a bush on campus at the
beginning of the year.

Now named Thurgood Marshall, or Thug
tor short, the cat was not initially intended to
be a permanent addition to Phillips’ dorm. “I
saw it hadn't gotten shots. and hence we kept
rt," Phillips said. “I was never really fond of
cats,hut1 enjoy having him around."

zac Ellington '10 said he adopted his cat
Pasha from a litter born in town a year and
a half ago. “I couldn't stand to see her go to a
shelter," he said. keeping Pasha has not been
diplomatically simple—a conﬂict over the cat
arose last year with RLC Tiffany Menard that
remained unresolved when Menard left the
position over Winter Break.

This year, Ellington has worked with his
ﬂoor in order to keep Pasha. “I do have one
neighbor with a cat allergy but [it] hasn't been
a problem," Ellington said. “we've been keep-
ing an open dialogue so that if it becomes a
problem, Pasha can spend more time in my
room. Everyone else has been excited about
her,"

Though Ellington has had few problems
with Pasha this year. he is often unsure about
where Pasha will go when he's not in Grinnell.
“As much as I love having her there are issues
when 1 go on breaks of where she’s going to
be housed I recommend thinking about this
first to anyone getting a cat," Ellington said.
"I understand why the College wouldn’t want
people to have cats, and i understand why a lot
of people who want to have cats around here
shouldn’t have one," He added that the school
should consider designating pet~frit=ndly
dorms in the future.

Pat Lyons'o9 presented a differentopinion
of contraband pets when asked about Duch-
ess, the puppy adopted by his soccer House
roommates before Lyons moved in for spring
semester. “When 1 ﬁrst heard they got a dog
I said, this sounds like a terrible idea," Lyons
said. “I'm actually surprised at how well its
gone that something awﬁil liitsnt happened to
the dog. It seems like the odds are in favoi of
some kind ottravesry occurring

The dog was originally purchased from

a neighbor by Parker Kocsttr 09 during (all
break and currently spends parlts oi its time in
a cage There are three people in the house
out of ﬁve that will take care ofit, and if one
orthose people is around, it's out ofthc cage,"
Lyons said. “They let it out a lot, but ifone of
those guys isn't around, it’s so young that it’ll
just pee all over everything."

Lyons added that he is “not wining to take
care of it whatsoever."

The worst part oflife with Duchess is that
“it’s really tough to enjoy a meal because the
dog jumps all over it," Lyons said. "he clearly
getting fed a lot, but it still tries to eat every
inanimate object, some animate onest"

Duchess’stay at Grinnell, however, is draw-
ing to a close. “1 do think we're getting rid of
it," Lyons said. “Spring break it's going hack
to Parker’s parents. It doesn’t get to do enough
dogtrype things here; it doesn’t have anyone to
play with."

Lyons would advise other students against
dog ownership “unless you have a lot of time
to spend with it and you don't plan on having
many parties, because the next thing you know
the dog is running around, getting into all
sorts of mischief i think [Soccer House] rear
ognizes that in their decision to send it home,
even though some or the guys really like the
dog—oi Parker really likes the dog."

Falling within the school's animal regUr
lations but in a federal gray area are the two
hedgehogs and two Monito geckos— both
listed as endangered species— that Pat Kijek
'10 acquired from a house in the Chicago sub»
urbs when an animal shelter employee seeking
homes for rescued exotics informed him ofthe
case “offthe record." Kijek has since found that
the geckos “have real life Spiderman superhe-
ro abilities" and that hedgehogs are "good for
keeping company with you while not being a
pain in the ass."

Kijek said that students encountering
hedgehogs “usually hold them and think that
they’ve bonded with the hedgehog in a way
that no one else has before them. They would
be wrong.”

For Kijek, the greatest challenge of pet
ownership has been getting food, as he has to
travel to Newton for his hedgehog’s diet re-
strictions. “Even in Newton they don’t really
have a good selection. you’ve got to give them
the same stuffover and over again,”l(ijek said.
“They get hored,1 think, itthey can think,”

In February, one ofKJjek’s hedgehogs died
after being aeotdentally dropped, The tragedy
was commemorated with a black light dance
party on High street, “Everyone was pretty
sad. but we partied it up to where we made
it not matter," Kijek said, “Since it was all in
white, it wasn't about mourning That day was
to remember everything that I'd ever done
with that hedgehog."
