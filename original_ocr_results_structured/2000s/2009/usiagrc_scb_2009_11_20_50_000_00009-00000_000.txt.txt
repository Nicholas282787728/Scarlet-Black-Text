Self—governance’s shortcomings

A recent survey has shown Grinnell stu-
dents to be more stressed, depressed and su
cidal than students nationwide and at Grin—
nell’s peer institutions.These ﬁndings begged
one question: why? After some
research, it was decided that
the primary difference bcrvvccn
Grinnell and its peers is the for
mat of Grinnell’s calendar. The
idea is that longer semesters
and longer stretches between
breaks lead to higher strcss.
While it is true that Grinnell's
calendar is “tougher" than that of many peers,
the difference, in my opinion, does not seem
great enough to have a substantial inﬂuence
on the stress of Grinncll students.

Moreover, restructuring the calendar is not
an easy rask. For years, the calendar has been
auto-generated from an algorithm developed
by our own Henry Walker (Computer Sci-
ence). And cvcry few years, talk of changing
the calendar has cropped up. Yer, the algo-
rithm remains unchangedThc main barricade
to change is the difficulty for faculty to shufﬂe
syllabi and reschedule lab sessionsThis prob-
lem stands today. The reorganizing of the
calendar would take an immense amount of
work, so if we plan to undertake it, we had
better make sure that its shortcomings are the
cause ofour stress and anxiety.

To me, there appears to be a more pre-
dominant Culprit. When my friends, many of
whom are enrolled at peer institutions, visit
Grinnell, they are consistently impressed by
the drug and alcohol use at Grinnell. For exr
ample, 10/10 would nor fly at most schools,
including our peers. It amazes me to see Secuz
riry officers walk passed a gamc ofbccr pong
between obviously-underage students with a
simple smile and a nod. I think such general
practices tend to emerge from a community
that demands self~governance as a corner-
stone. In fact, its probably impossible to have
our level of selfzgov with a stricter Security
dcparrmenr.

While I adore the idea of sclfrgovcrnance
and applaud its frequent success, 1 do think
that it allows for more alcohol and drug use
than is healthy This is not a recent feature of
Grinnell’s cultureithcre's even a rumor that
a few decades ago, at any one time, some—
where around 70 percent ofGrinnellians were
tripping acid. Whilc mental health surveys
are a recent development, I believe that had
rhcy ousted dccadcs ago, they would have
shown Grinncll students to regularly be more
stressed and depressed than peers at other col-
leges (even before the current calendar ms
implemented).

The cast of obraining and using alcohol
and drugs at Grinnell is, in all likelihood,
causing more frequent use. This high fre
quency makcs it more likely for students to

get behind in class, which, inevitably, leads to
poorer mental health. It is often argued that
substance abuse stems from feelings of being
overwhelmed and a need to blow off steam.
However, I posit that even if stress could be

temporarily diminated, it would

It seems to me that selfzgon

romance, as it stands now, is not dealing well

with alcohol and drug abuse, and this, not rhc
academic calendar, is the root of Grinncll‘s
strain and melancholia. Either self-governance
needs to grow to handle this issue, or we need
to work with Security to redeﬁne what alcohol
and drug practices are acceptable. If nothing
else, we need to take a closer look at the effects
of substance use on mental health rather than
assuming that it is a byproduct of stress 'and
depression. We need to do this before spends
ing more time and energy on restructuring the
academic calendar.

Problems with Dr. Ruether’s talk

1 am writing to express my deep frustration
and disappointment with this past Monday’s
presentation by Rosemary Radford Ruether.
While Dr. Ruether is a highlymcgarded femi-
nist theologian, she is not an expert on Middle
East history and politics. Regardless ofwhethz
or one agrccs or disagrees wirh Dr. Ructher’s
opinions on the Israeli~Palestinian conﬂict, her
prcscntarion was disorganized and rambling,
lacking the academic thoroughness and rigor
that we should expect from lecturers contribut-
ing to the intellectual environment at Grinnell.
There were numerous factual inaccuracies and
polemical statements in her presentation that
belie her stated intention of promoting diaz
loguc and peace around this most important
issue.

As examples of the falsehoods in Dr. Ru-
ether‘s presentation, consider the following.

In the informational sheet she provided, Dr.

Ruether claims that Jews did not accept the
territorial limits of the 1947 United Nations
partition plan.This is patently falsbthere are
numerous archival films Sh0W*
ing chs dancingin the streets
with joy at the prospect of hav»
ing a nation, regardless of the
compromises entailed by the
partition plan, Dr. Ruether also
characterized the establishment
of the State of Israel as “com-
pensation" for the destruction of
the Holocaust, a cynical and overly simplistic
View of the long hisrory of the Jewish Diasr
pora, She also relies on Stephen Walt and John
Mearsheimer, whose work has been widely dis»
credited (Harvard University, where Walt is on
the faculty of the Kennedy School of Govern-
ment, removed its imprimatur from their pub-
lications on the subject).

Furthermore, in her talk Dr. Ruether
claimed that the first intifada (the uprising
lasting from 1987 until the Oslo accords were
signed in 1993) was completely non-violenti
this claim is patently false.Thousands of both
Israelis and Palestinians were either injured or
killed during this periodThcsc casualties were
anything but one»sided. Between 1990 and
1992, two or three times as many Palestinians
were killed annually by other Palestinians than
by Israeli forces. Furthermore, in characteriz—
ing Israel's actions in Gaza since the evacuation
of the Jewish settlements in 2005 as a violar
tion of the ceasefire, Dr. Ruether ignores the
fact that thousands of rockets and mortar shells
have been ﬁred each year from the Gaza Strip
into populated areas in sourhern Israel, espe-
cially the city of Sdcrur.

Perhaps more troubling than these factual
problems is some of the language Dr. Ruether
used to describe the situation. In one case, she
used the term “ethnic cleansing" to describe
Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians. While I
agree that in many cases Israel's actions may
be called unjust or evcn possibly abhorrent, the
usc of a provocative term like “ethnic cleans-
ing" is an irresponsible and outrageous claim.
The fact is that the stated objective of every
Israeli government since the establishment of
zthe State in 1948 has been to live peacefully
with Israel's neighbors, while factions within
the PLO and especially Hamas have yet to
disavow their explicitly-stared goal of destroy-
ing Isracl. Israeli troops take extraordinary
measures to protect civilians,w ' Palestinian
terrorists routinely target Israeli lians. In no
way should Israel be compared to Holocaust-
era Germany, the killing fields in Cambodia
or Bosnia in the 1990s by the use of a term
like “ethnic cleansing." Dr. Ruether also char-
actcrized Ariel Sharon's ascent to the Temple
Mount on scprembcr 29, 2000, as an “inva-
sion,” a clear exaggeration of the facts on the
ground. While Sharon's visit may have been
poorlyztimed and questionable, it can in no

I could cite many other examples of ﬂaws
in Dr. Ruether’s facts and rea-
soning, but the illustrations I
have provided should be suﬂ‘r
cicnt to emphasize the need for
critical thinking in evaluating
the sources of information we
use to understand a very com-
plex situation. Dr. Ruether’s
one—sided oversimplitications
of the facts only did a disservice to the cause
of establishing a thoughtﬁll dialogue on one
of the most important political problems of
our time. I invite all members of rhe campus
community who are inrercstcd in pursuing a
respectful and well-reasoned dialogue about
the Israeli-Palestinian conﬂict to contact me
directly.

inconvenienced by Jimbo’s close

I just wanted to comment on the bit in
your Staff editorial about Jimbo’s closing. 1
agree the Pizza was good and the fact that
they delivered was very cool, but the students
and faculty that expected pizza at the math
seminar the Monday after Iimbo’s closed were
sorely disappointed. Jimbo's happily took the
order on Friday afternoon and then closed
their doors over the weekend wirhour saying a
word and leaving a large group of students to
go without lunch on Monday. That act alone
makes me ambivulent about them closing.

Errors in campus climate article

There is misrepresentation of the com-

number of cases of sexual assault reported
in the climate assessment. This mistake was

that roughly 30 percent ofour community (a
little over 700) completed the campus climate

28 people reported that they had been sexu-
ally assaulted, which is roughly four percent
of those who respondedThe published story
mistakenly reports that 30 percent of the poor
plc who responded to the survey had been
sexually assaulted, which is not what the data
supports. We must be clear about what the
climate assessment datademonstrates. With
that said, in no my: do I mean to lessen the
trauma felt by those 28 members of our com—.
munity who report they have been sexually asv
