It is hard to precisely identify the begin»
ning of selfrgovernance. Ken Christiansen,
Biology, who came to Grinnell in 1956,
remembers, “there has always been a great
deal ofdemocracy at this institution" At the
opposite end of the instructional spectrum,

bulletin language of the ﬁrst

“self-government" and has
had various names since then.

When discussing stir-governance, Mar
demies dont necessarilyeometo the forefront
of people's minds, but sdfvgovemance prin»
ciples are embedded in Grrnnells academic
policies. “ScIf-govcmancc also ﬁts with the

SGA Vice President of Academic Affairs-
Electjoanna DcMars'lo thought this action
was “unnecessary and potentially hurtful'so
she went directly to the professor with “the

 

overall academic philoso-
phy," Osgood said.

The close studentrfacV
ulty relationships clearly
demonstrate how self-gov-

as Max Leung, Sociology,

Professors rm: always
encouraged to work wrth

something members of the
College promoted as a dis

“There is a more iii—depth

Often, students feel comfortable apt

what they are learning. After a protessor

of Grinnell, [and] students
came to talk to us."

Some believe that this connection be-
tween self-governance and academics rs cor
incidental, not purposeful. “self-gownranee
ties to other institutions such as the open
curriorlum,"Leungsard.

dam was not a tool or too loose."

In the 1960's, :in SGA referendum 53110
cloned Hall Presidents to declare “homrmlc”
about maIB*fe|‘nilIc visitation—eventually
leading the College President to follow suit

But it was not unliI the early 1990's that
self-govcmanct: achieved its own section in
the Student Handbook. “Hill: the term
had been used in this publication for years
beforehand, it was never categorized as a
hilly-sanctioned College policy,

“The term self-governance ﬂoats around
student handbooks,”Hoﬂ’ina-in said.“1t was a
philosophy that people talked about happen-
ing separately but is not articulated" Today,
studeno and adrninisnators still struggle to
nailrdown cracily what self-governance is,
but it is important not to forget its'“t‘rnieless
mistence."

'I'IIIE ALASSIIIIIIIIII

Similarly to in student life, selfrgoverr
mince in academics does not mean cndlcss
freedom. “You cannot decide to not have a
majoror go abroad for three terrns,”0sgootl
said. Still, only haung one required class is a
lot offrccdom.

The shared approach to school work also
embodiesselrrgovemance. “At Grrnnell,1do
not feel competitiv: with my fellow class
mates and we really rolue working together,"
Dernars saidxlrlelping each other out is not
necessarily a governing thing but the sense of
community that comes out ofthat"

While the overlap ofselfrgovcmance and
academics is very dircclfur Hofﬁnnn,shchas
found that all Grinnellians can gain intel-
lectual development from sclfrgovemance
both in and out ofth classroom. “There has
always been the idea that self-governance is
important for education so thattheycan learn
about governing thornselyts,"Hoirman said.

1887 — “Grinncll college President
George Gates inaugural address outlined
some early principles of selfrgmlcmalice:
‘It is ten thousand nines hotter that the
young people should learn to govern
themselves, than that they should lse gov-
ci'ncd in any best way whatsoever’“(SGA
Self-GoverlmnceTcxt).
