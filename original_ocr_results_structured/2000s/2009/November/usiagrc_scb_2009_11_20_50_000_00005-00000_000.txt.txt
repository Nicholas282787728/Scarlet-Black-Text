Heavy Williams picture fails to dream big

liv COLIN CARR

It‘s a shame Vincent Ward's “What Dreams May Come,"
starring Robin Williams, didn’t receive much commercial ah
tention when it ﬁrst hit theaters, Supposedly its solemn granr
diosity turned oﬂ’viewers who expect a little bombast in their
Robin Williams movies. But believe me when I say that, if
the ﬁlm somehow gained home rental
momentum, it would have exciting po»
tential as one of those shockingly mis-
calculated movies, the kind in which the
ﬁlmmakers would like to pretend they
were going for something rongniceande
cheek.

Unfortunately the hilarity of the ﬁlm's absurd badness lies
hidden under too many layers of grave seriousness for more
emotional viewers to be able to appreciate it—for example,
the ﬁlm involves two car accidents, one following exactly four
years arrer the other. A happily married, Chris (Williams)
and Annie (Annabelle Sciorra), lose their two children in a
car accident. Annie sinks into a horrible depression, becom-
ing institutionalized and causing Chris to leave her, unable to
cope with her pained state. Four years later, the two get back
together. But then—with car accident two—Chris dies, and

wakes up in heaven,

Heaven, by the way, is rendered with style and ingenuiry.
in the ﬁlm's rneraphysrcs, heaven is divided into vast realms,
one belonging to each individual allowed in. Chris’ realm is a
rhreedimension painting. The colors are vibrant and coalesce
impressionistically. So painterly is the environment thatiln
an admittedly cheesy touch—When
Chris touches some speciﬁc part of the
landscape, he smudgcs it and gets its col—
or on his hand. The look, feel and idea
of the landscape are ultimately powerful
in their disconcerrion.The heaven Chris
experiences may be gorgeous but, insofar
as it belongs to and is crafted for him, its majesty is artiﬁcial,
somehow hollow,

The implications of this environment might have been ex—
plored more richly if the film hadn’t felt the need to foist a
host of contrivances onto Chris and the viewer. Namely, Chris
gets a visit from a Hollywoodrcquircd, obligarory black spiri-
tual mentor (played by Cuba Gooding, Jr), who informs Chris
that, back on earth, Annie committed suicide, As a result, she’s
going to hell. Chris decides he must rescue her.

This is where the ﬁlm's narrative development goes from

thew Kluber, Art. Hybrid media is an ambiguous
style of art. The students can utilize any com-

”Hie class is designed to introduce students
to contemporary studio practice and the full
rangc of artistic order,” Kluber said. The class
also encourages students to experiment with ar-
tistic styles they are less familiar with.

art media and working wirh their interactions,”

melodramatic to wildly misguided. In the film’s hell,I was sub
jected to so many twists, tricks and surprise loopholes that I
couldn’t help but imagine the drama that must have went on
behind the scenes, as the writers pulled their hair out, trying
to ﬁnd some logical way to save a woman from eternal damna—
tion. As if the ﬁlmmakers knew the film might one day have
potential as a camp entertainment, they even throw in a truly
abrasive cameo from eccentric German director Werner Her-
zog, playing one ofhell's tormented sinners,

What is most problematic about the film's contrived efforts
at a happy ending is the way in which it inhibits any discussion
of the moral and spiritual issues in the world the ﬁlm creates.
So much time is put into ﬁguring out how to rescue Annie
from hell that the ﬁlm fails to ask to whether it is justiﬁable for
her to be there to begin with. One might accuse me ofimpos—
ing these problems on a ﬁlm that meant merely to entertain.
But if the filmmakers are ambitious enough to mimic Dante's
"Inferno” and also so blundy suggest its protagonist, Chris, ro
be a Christ ﬁgure, then surely they ought to have the courage
to deal with a spiritual problem as obvious as this one. in wax-
ing profound yet falling to deliver, “What Dreams May Come"
constitutes a superﬁcial and pretentious viewing experience.

During the instillation’s opening on Wednese
day, Nov. 11,Bonham asked visitors to burn small
folded paper houses and then pin them up on a
sheet of Styrofoamrlike material.

Bonhams work is a prime example ofhybrid
media because it uses community as a medium
for creating the art. "The viewer becomes part
maker," lcluber said. In this sryle explicitly, and
arguably in art in geneml, rhose who will ultir
marely see a work inherently take an acrive role
