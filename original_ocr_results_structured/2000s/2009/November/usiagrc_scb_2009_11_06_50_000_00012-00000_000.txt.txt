GRINNELL, KS: We like this town because it is our
namesake and it has a cute slogan... but otherwise,
with a population of 329, it sounds pretty wack.

 

CRINNELL LAND: This sounds as though it should
be a magical place of all things Crinnell,,.turns
out/ it’s just some place in Canada.

A rant about last week’s rant

 

 

Whining about the noise level in the library

for our education, and that a lot of problems are
solved and ideas implcmcnctcd with our tuition
money... But seriously, being one of the top libs
eral arts schools in the nation, can: we freaking
afford it better Internet serVice? I'm sick and tired
of campus computers doing stupid things like
telling me they don't have a wirclcss signal, or
tnking n whole minute to send an e»mni1.’l‘hose
minutes add up! And so does the frustration!

ing hall makes me, but I am too sick from the
dining hall to really get into it. It’s still too real.

—Co[: Ungu"13

is as effective as vintching palm dry on rhc walls.
In the rare event people choose to have these so-
callcd “full—volume conversations" is their busi-
ness. Don’t get me wrong Lhough, respecting
others by keeping the noise leVel down is impor
tant, especially in Grinnell. However. that does
not give any studcnr "librarian" the right to ha»
rass those who are just catching up wirh friends
for a brief moment. This just reminds me ofold,

. bitter librsrnns saying, “Sshli” when even a pin

drops, Libraries are just as much a social place
as an acidcmic place, and the last time I checked
we were college students and can do whatever
rhc HELL we wsnr, with some responsibility for
others. Moreover, carrying convos in the librnrn
ics is not an obsession, it just hippcnsll Clear
enough?
