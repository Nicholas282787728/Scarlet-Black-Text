begin Season at home

BY SAM“ SHAUGHNESSY
After over a month of training, the
Grinnell swimming and Diving Team will
begin their competitive season this week-
end with meets against a club team from
_ the University of Nebraska in Grinnell on
Friday and against Augustana College in
Rock Island, Ill. on Saturday
“This is a really great weekend," said
women's Team CorCaptain Meghan Mcr
Doniel '10. "it's good practice for back-to:
back meets which We have a lot each sea-
son."
After a time trial, an intrasquad meet
and an alumni meet, the Mad Ducks and
Mad Dogs, as the women's and Men’s team
respectively call themselves, are ready to
face some real competition,

“Just to get out there and swim against
some other swimmers than each other is
going to be really good for us," said Men's
Team corcaptain Paul Gagne ’10.“The peo
ple we are sWimming against are deﬁnitely
smaller teams than us and it should be a ten
ally good starting off point."

The meet on Friday is one offour home
meets this season—something the team
sees as both an advantage and a special op-
portunity. Not only does the team get to
sleep in their own beds, but the normally
empty bleachers in the na‘tatorium are filled
with friendly faces. Additionally, while the
number of bus seats limits the number of
swimmers able to compete in away meets,
the entire team can participate at home.

"You know we’ve seen some less than
desirable pools at meets away," said Men’s
Team co-captain Anders Ahlberg '10. “but
at home we have some pretty good support.
it's nice to see people come out and cheer
us on.

Overall, Head Coach Erin Hurley feels

that both teams are ready to make a state-
ment this weekend, ,
“The team is excited to compete, and
that is always a good thing," Hurley said.
Hurley expects Saturday’s meet against
Augusrana to be the more competitive of
the two meets and consequently a good ‘li'iT
dicator of the team's physical preparation.
However, the team has n blank slate
right now and most of the focus will'be on
the right foot, or—more appropriately—
stroke.
“1 think at this point we are just try
ing to get our bearings," Morgan Bobet ’12

,said. “it's difﬁcult to set expectations when

we don't really have a starting point."

As for beyond this weekend, Hurley
scheduled several tough teams in order to
prepare for the competition ofthe Midwest
Conference Championship meet in Febiur
ary—the women's team has won the last 11
titles, and the men have won the last nine.

“We might not be at the top of the con-
ference in many events, but we are a deep
team, that is, we have many swrmmers that
can score points and contribute," Hurley
said.

In addition to their ability, the mindset
ofthe team certainly reflects the dedication
ofthe team.

“I think that we’ve been having high
quality practices and that everyone seems
really focused,"Women's Team CorCaptain
Amy Hadow ’10 said.

Both teams have a goal of bringing
home another MWC Championship, and
that means treating every race as an oppor—
tunity, starting with this weekend.

“Sure, some meets will be tough but we
want to view each race as a practice for cons
ference,"McDoniel said.

We are living in an interesting era in sports
history. 1 like to call it the “free agency" era, be-
cause it seems like more and more champion-
ships are being won (and lost) in the offseason

rather than on the ﬁeld/courdicc. All one has

to do is take a look at some of the names in
the 2010 free agency class in die NBA to get
a gist of the impact that the trades will have.
The 2010 class features LeBron James, Dwayne
Wade and Chris Bosh, three studs from the
famous draft class of 2003, as well as, such as
Ainar’e Stoudemire,]oe Johnson, Dirk Nownn
zki, Carlos Boozer, Paul Pierce, Manu Ginobili
and Steve Nashﬂll of whom are all-stars and
potential hall-ofrfamersTo the general manag-
ers of the NBA, the free agent class onOlO is
hke Christmas, and with all due respect to the
rest of the po—
tential presents
under the tree,
I want to focus
on the [iCkIET
me-Elino that
e v e r y b o d y
wan ts—L e B -
ron James. The
summer of 2010 marks an important decision
in the career of the young superstar—does he
exercise his player option and decide to fulfill
his duty as the anointed savior of Cleveland, or
is he too tempted by the pull ofa big-money,
big—market team with a rich tradition, like the
Knicks? .
Since the day LeBron inked a threeryear
extension on his current deal in 2006, there
has been speculation over what would happen
to LeBton after the 200910 season. LeBron
himselfhas added fuel to the fire by playing coy
when the media inquires about his future al-
though recently he has pushed those questions
to the backburner. As a result. there are several
teams in the league that have been clearing cap
space for the summer of 2010 since 2006! The
biggest player in the LeBron James Sweepr
stakes is the New York Knicks.l have never seen
a professional sports team so completely bank
on the possibility oflanding a free agent. The
Knicks only have four players officially locked
up through next season, all inexpensive young
guys that the Knicks have drafted within the last
three years. That's right tolks, the Knicks cannot
even put a full team on the ﬂoor next season
without doing some shopping. Not only do the
Knicks have the cap space to land LeBron, but
they could potentially land anothel top-tier free
agent, such as Drwade or Chris Bosh, as well.
Besides the lure of playing with another
great player, there are a couple of other reasons
that could attractjames to New York. First and
foremost, there's the cash. LeBron has openly
stated a desire to become a “global icon," and
the world’s largest media market can certainly
help that cause. While a number of other teams
may be able to make an offer to James of simir
lat monetary value, only the Knicks can ensure
James that he will make more money in sponr
sorships as an athlete in NYC than he could
anywhere else. Second, there’s the legacy that
LcBron could make for himself in New York
It's well known that Madison Square Garden is

a basketball Mecca in one of the most basket—
ball crazy cities in the world. If the draw ofsee—
ing kids at Rucker Park wearing their LeBron
jersey: with “New York" sewn across the front is
not enough, the thought of someday having his
‘23’ hang in the rafters with the likes of Frazier,
Monroe and Reed might be just enough to send
LeBron eastbound.Third, LeBron has some fa-
miliatity with Coach D'Antonl via' USA Bas~
ketball, and he knows as well as anybody that
he is literally the perfect player for the Knicks'
ritn—and-gun style ofofrense,

Obviously, there are a craprload of incen-
tives for Lebron to sign with the Knicks, but
Cleveland will offer LeBron some serious cash
before they lose him. Let's not forget that the
Cleveland Cavs are also players in the LBJ

sweepstakes,
and they too
have been
clearing cap
space for some
time in anticr
pation of the
fateful sums
mer of 2010.
Therefore, it is doubtful that any team will be
able to offer James a larger contract than the
Cavs will, especially when the entire fate of the
franchise hinges on it. Since LeBron arrived in
'03, the team has gone from a constant fixture
in the draft lottery and an embarrassment to the
city, to a perennial contender mar consistently
sells out their building and is the lone bright
spot in a sports landscape littered with losers—
namcly Browns and Indians. Therein lies the
No.1 reason the Cleveland-native should stay
with the Cavs: it is his destiny to win the city of
Cleveland a championship.

LeEron can take the route to a ring that
many star athletes choose~move to a big»
market team that will spend a lot or money
to surround me with great players and win
a championship. However, think about how
much greater the lore ofLeBron James will be
if he can win in Cleveland? only the greatest
of the great can single~handedly turna losing
franchise into a winner (Michael Jordan, Larry
Bird, etc). Great players like Jordan and Bird
weren't successful solely because of their skills
on the court, but because the winning attitude
they brought to the team was positively mags -
netic in attracting prized free agents. it’s already
happening in Cleveland—the Cavs have been
a major player in the last few oft-seasons, and
made a huge splash this past summer by land-
ing Shaq, the third and final reason LeBron will
stay at home. There is absolutely no way Shaq
daddy is coming to Cleveland ifLeBrort James
is not on that team——I don't care how much
money the Cavs threw at him. But most im-
portantly ichBron opts to stay with the Cavs,
it's looking like they will still have enough cap
space to go after one of the big names that will
be available. If the Cavs could land Chris Bosh,
or the next best thing, Amare Stoudemire, the
Cavs become the clearrcut favorites to win the
NBA title for at least the next couple ofscasons.
