Swimmers, Divers prepare to defend their dynasty

A stronger schedule and mandatory weight training to bolster swim team’ s talent and experience on their Conference campaign

BY Max CALENRERG

For the past eight years, the Grinnell
Men‘s Swimming team has won the Midwest
Conference (MWC) Championship. Even
better, the Women's team has won for the last
11 seasonsiso Head Coach Erin HurleyIs
goal for this season Is simply, “stay there,"shc
said.

The squad will have its first test the week
end of Nov. 13, when rhey' jump In the pool
against the University of Nebraskas Club
team at 5 p m at home on Friday, Nov. 13.
The next day they will travel to Augustana
College in Illinois to ra_ce against the Vikings
at 1 pm.

Hurley designed the first half of the scar
son to have harder workouts and challenging
nonsconferencc opponents In order to ready
her team for when the Midwest Conference
Championship rolls around In February.

"We need to focus on what we need to do,
which Is get In really good shape, and then
work on the fine timing of [each athletes]
event,I l—lIurIey said. our schedule is set up so
we will get pounded a few times but we also

will pretty competitive in other meets, but It ’s
a long road a lot can happen between now
and February"

The difficult scheduling Is an attempt
by Hurley to ensure her team has the right
mindset once the MWC Championship
comes around,

“As a coach, I want to make sure we are
humbled a few times during the season,"
Hurley said. “It doesnIt allow us to take things
for granted—it shows us we still have things
to work on and Its motivation to keep work-
Ing hard."

In addition to the schedule changes,
Hurley has made the once voluntary weight-
training program mandatory for her squad.
Team Captain Amy Hadow 10 knows this
could greatly help the team come later' In the
season.

“I think [weight rraInIng] is absolutely
necessary Swimming Is an entire body com-
mitment. For your body to be strong enough
you have to be doing abs and weight litring,"
Bobcr said The people that do really well
are the ones who are committed to overall

strength for their entire body, not just in the
water."The men’s team seems to set up' to take
a ninth consecutive MWC with some major
reruriiing swimmers as well as an inﬂux of
new talent Senior tan warlick 10 is very im-
pressed with this years teammates.

“The team looks really strong, we have a
lot returning guys who are very fast, Warlick
said. Iweve got Tom Lankiewicz [12], hes
a school record holder in the 400 IM, Cyrus
Mysrry [’11] Is back, he's a national qualiﬁer
in the 100 and 200 breastroke, Nick Smith
['10] is back, and he qualiﬁed for nationals in
diving last year

Dcnison University transfer Bthan DrUr
tchas '12, a talented sprinter, adds to the
strength of this years team Coach Hurley
sees the possible intrasquad competition
between Drutchas and her other talented
sprinter, Max FulgoniI l2, as beneficial for
both parties -

"[Fulgonil Is the defending Conference
champion In the so [freestyle], and l know
Ethan is just going to make[ [FulgonI] bets
ter and[ [Fulg'oni] Is just going to make Ethan

berrer, Hurley said.
With all this talent, Warlick says that the

' mens team goals have risen to continue to

challenge the team.
"We’ve got other goals beyond just wins

, ning, the conference championship," Warlick

said, “We want to break some relay records.
we want to beat Luther [College]7we
haven’t done that in a few years and they’ve
kind of become our big rival. We don’t want
to lose any ofour home meets. II

After losIng some accomplished swim-
mers to graduation such as MWC record
holder and lasr years so and 100 frecsrylc
champion Valerie srimac, rhe womenIs team
has a more difﬁcult lane to the Conference
Championship. Coach Hurley Is looking to
her teatn’s depth to score points as well as for
some members to step up and have break out

seasons.

“When you lose talent, it definitely opens
a door and forces people to step up, "Hurley
said. “But we donIt have to win a single event
and we could still win Conference."

make it to BCS Champs

lfAC/Dc has taught us anything as a society, Its that Ir
certainly Is a long way to the top if you wanna rock n roll

' it's an aphorism that is proving very true ofcoilegc football, as

several teams without a loss vie for a chance to play in the BCS
National Championship. There are now six teams that have
a pretty good chance to finish undefeated—the SEC chains
pion, which is either Alabama or Florida, Texas, Iowa, Cine
cinnati, TCU and Boise State.
But thanks to college football’s
current bowl system, only two
will get to play for the national
championship.

Obviously this Is stupid, an
opinion that Is so widely agreed
upon that President Baraek
Obama cvcn cited the need for a college football playoff In
fact, most years feature a team that could legitimately argue
they deserved to play for the national championship Instead of
who actually did. FriggInI Greek tragedy right? i mean, were
talking l-laemon lying next to Antigone in a pile ofblood, here!
Dont we need to grab our pitchforks and torches and go rescue
BeHrfnmrthrEeast storm the BCS castle? Nah This year will
not be a catalyst for a playoff revolutlon because at seasons end
only two teams will have truly earned the right to compete for
the national championship ofcollcge football.

This year will be like many others In that Cadillac programs
like Florida, Alabama and Texas will have the easiest path to
the championship. Some might say this is because every season

they at least contend for the championship according to the

best objective measures, record and strength of schedule, and
thus ascend the polls With greater ease than other programs.
To these cynics, perennial powers like the aforementioned
teamsiUSC, Ohio State, Virginia Tech or (inexplicably)
Notre Dame—can always work their way into the upper ech-
elon of the Top 25 with a body of work that’s more Dennis
Franz than Kim Delaney, while a team with less football his-
tory—like Oregon or Cincinnatiﬁmust work much harder.
The fact that USC, before being completely pulled apart by
Oregon last weekend, managed to get back Into the Top 5 after
losing to good but not great WashIngton gives some credence
to this argument.

Obviously, teams that are usually superb will get the benefit
of a doubt over teams that are usually mediocre, I hear the in-
dignant masses when they complain that after getting the pole
position (pun intended) at the start of the season, these old
guard teams will be in the championship game if they win out,
even if another team that did not begin as highly touted also
has a perfect record and as much or more objective credibility
“Isn't this a travesty?" they cry from salt Lake City, from Fort
Worth, and from Boise. “Good teams with undefeated records
sometimes donIt make it! How does this happen> Why?!" they
Incessantly screech on sports message boards (they just yell at
their computers and I hear them. Its the lamest superpower
ever, but you take what you can get),Their grievance does, how-

Kramer’s Rules

ever, present a quandary How can we be sure that a deserving
team makes it‘ to the national championship? By asking rher
torical questions,which are really annoying in a written format?

The way we can determine whos a contender and whoIs a
pretender Is scheduling. Boise state ranks. 84th in strength of
schedule rIght now—the Broncos are goodsbut in no way do
they deserve to supplant Texas (sist), Florida (5th), or Ala-
bama (34th) The TCU Horned
Frogs have a‘sllghtly more legiti-
mate ease with the 39th toughr
est schedule, but that's still not
nearly high enough to leapfrog a
school froln a major conference
that has played opponents of ap—
proximately the same toughness.
1 therefore see no great Injustice In the possible exclusion ofan
undefeated Boise state or TCU from this year’s championship
because neither played enough Bcsrconference foes to merit
placement with teams whose entire schedule, save for a few
carly cupcakes, is major conference opponents.

However, that logic gets thrown out the window when we
consider the cases of Iowa and Cincinnati, two BCSrconferr
ence teams that could very well finish undefeated and out of
the title game. But do these teams have a more legitimate gripe
than TCU or Boise? Not really, if you look at their schedules.
Iowa's strength of schedule is ranked 12th overall, Cincinnati's
46thtThis Is especially damning for the Bearcats because in ad- ~
dition to their weak schedule, the Big East has the reputation
ofbeing a terrible football conference.To most voters, it doesn’t
deserve an automatic bowl bid any more than the Mountain
West conference, so I'm going to Ignore Cincy's champIonship
ho es.

PThat leaves Iowa as the only possible unbeaten that might
deserve to play for the championship but be left out. While
this would be unjust, nobody can honestly say that the Hawk-
eyes have looked better than Florida, Alabama or Texas, even
though their strength of schedule, 12th, Is exemplary and better
than the Longhorns’ and Crimson Tide's.The Hawkeyes simr

-ply do not have a championship-caliber quarterback. Jeremiah

MasoliIs Oregon could be even more deserving, but losing the
first game of the college season on The Blue at Boise will keep
them out of title contention. The Ducks should still be very
proud of handing Pete Carroll his worst loss as coach of USC
and dominating the Trojans on both sides ofthe ball in Eugene.
if anything, fault the Ducks for having too tough a schedule,
which gave them their only loss andwill relegate them to fac-
ing Iowa, where they ll continue to assert their status as a new
power program The Ducks should take their lesson In schedule
Ing from Florida. The Gators play rhree cupcakes and then a
lot of good but unexceptional BCS schools through their SEC
schedule. With proper scheduling, the road to the BCS doesn’t
have to be a highway to hell, but rather a dirty deed, done dirt
cheap. Or something.
