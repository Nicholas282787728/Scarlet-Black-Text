New Drake Community Library opens its

BY KAMILA BERKALIEVA

The Drake Library opened on Monday,
Nov. 2nd after 18 months of construction
broke ground in May of 2008i The new li-
brary, named for Professor of History and
former President of Grinnell George Drake,
replaces the Stewart Library on Broad Street.

In addition to increasing the square foot»
age threefold, there have been many im»
provements made to beneﬁt library‘ users.
Although it has about the same number of
books as the Stewart Library, it has four
times the amount of computers, and free

wireless Internet. One convenient addition
is a singleelevel floor plan, as opposed to the
old fourestory plan, The new building is de
signed to be more accessible to handicapped
persons and makes maneuvering throughout
the library easier. Marna Montgomery, 3 fre»
quent visitor, is pleased with the new layout.
"Oh, it's so much better and more spread
out? said Montgomery. “1 think they did a
wonderful job, they should be so proud."
Accessibility is only one element of many
as the building is also much more environ-
mentally friendly This is largely thanks to the

(Leadership in Energy and Environmental
Design). Drake Library features a geothermal
heating and cooling system that uses the heat
exchange between the earth and air in order
to regulate the temperature inside the library.
Also, like the Grinnell college Dining Hall,
the lighting inside the library adjusts to the
outside brightness.Thanks to these upgrades,
the library uses 50 percent less energy than a
building of the same size without such come
