Intercollegiate and intramural sports get ticklish nod

Andrew Walsh ’09 and the Grinnell Tickle City committee select various Grinnell sports teams to win this week’s award.

This week, due to the several enthu-
siastic verbal submissions I received, the
Grinnell Tickle Ciry
Award decisively
goes to Grinnell ath—
letics.

Over the past
weeks, the volleyball
team made the Corr
ference tournament and both men’s and
women’s cross country teams recently took
home conference titles.

The men's soccer team made history by
winning the Midwest Conference Tourna»
ment and advancing to the NCAA Tourna-
ment for the ﬁrst time in school history. In
the MWC semiﬁnals, the Pioneers defeated
St. Norbert College on penalty kicks after
playing to a scoreless tie. The next day they
beat Beloit in another penalty shootout
after the game ended zsz. Brimming with
conﬁdence in penalty kick tie-breakers,
the Pioneers tried to confuse NCAA first—
round opponent Macalester College by logs

ically arguing why they should go straight to
penalty kicks without playing a single min—
ute ofregulation.

Unfortunater
ly, the players
of Macalester,
an institution
ranked 29th of
all liberal arts
colleges in the nation by us. New or World
Report, realized at the last second what was
going on and didn’t agree. Macalester went
on to win an extremely hardvfought game
with a score onVO and the Pioneers now la-
ment the fact that they didn't draw a state
school in the first round.

Also, Pioneer basketball is underway and
the women‘s team won their first game of
the season at Cornell College. On the men's
side, the highsscoring runrandrgun offense
we know and love is back to business. Look

Learning to live at the heart of industrial agriculture

Jordan Scheibel ’09.S considers the issues raised by Grinnell College’s location at the center of a problematic farming industry

Ifyou look at a map of the corn Belt, as with the his-
torical range of the tallgrass prairie, you will and town
right at the center, completely covered by a swath of corn
agriculture that stretches from Nebraska to Ohio. When I
went to the Community Food Security Conference in Des
Moines last month. several people referred to our location
as “the belly ofthe beast,"meaning that Iowa is at thc heart
of the industrial agriculture that most activists who were
attending the conference opposed.

The cliche of this phrase aside, this sense of being at
center of the problem you are trying to address 1 rhrnk
lent a different feel to the conference than say, ifit were in
Madison, Wisconsin or Burlington, Vermont, both cities
that are surrounded by organic agriculture. so what docs it
mean for us at Grinnell College to be in the “belly of the
beast"?

First, I think it means something different to me than it
does to the marketing staff at Grinnell College. 1 happened
to find a short promotional poster books
let for the college in Burling Library last
week. It has since disappeared, but a quick
look through it gave me an interesting
window into the approach of the people
promoting the college. Like the ad at the
Des Moines airport that falsely suggested
the presence of wind turbines on campus,
the promotional booklet appropriated and
romanticized agriculture as a metaphor
for the different activities and programs
at the college—showing, for example, a
swrmming pool with swimmers and giant
soybean pods in it and a child eating an ear of sweet corn
in a com field.

While these images may seem pretty innocuous or just

plain ridiculous, I think they indicate a misguided ape
propriation of agriculture as n cheery metaphor for the
Grinnell experience. It’s a problem because the agriculture
they're appropriating has been devastating to Iowa’s eco-
systems and .the health of its communities, 1 can under-
stand the bind that thc college is
infignoring agriculture as part
of Grinnell, which seems to have
been the case in the past, is not
a good approach either. But unr
critically romanticizing it seems
equally if not more problematic as
a promotional strategy. In this context, using agriculture as
a promotional tool seems akin to a college in Detroit using
the manufacturing lndustly as a backdrop for its innovas
tivc approach to education. Agriculture is doing to Iowa
in many ways what the demise of manufacturing is doing
to Detro' .

so What is our role as a college in re-
lation to industrial agriculture? For one,
I think it is our responsibility to draw at
tention to the immediate problems that
industrial agriculture is causing, one is
the effect ofchemical fertilizers, pesticides
and herbicides saturating the ecosystem
and affecting human health. Another is the
unhealthy food system that is supported
by industrial agriculture. Last is the de-
population ofrhe countryside and the slow
death ofsmall towns. As farms get bigger,
young people stop farming and growing
corn and soybean ceases to be a viable livelihood except for
the largest producers.

Sitting in the belly of the beast shouldn't mean we have

f BECOMING NATIVE
TO THIS PLACE

to disregard these problems altogether by ignoring them
or by whitewashing them. It should mean that rather than
appropriating agriculture out of context and changing its
meaning ro fit the status of the college, the college should
use its resources and its knowledge to engage with agri-
culture in context and change its
own status to fit with the place
that Iowa has become. The Praia
rie Studies department, its ins
ternships and the classes that fall
under its heading are all doing
that. but the college itselfremains
largely out ofplace. i think the current tactics ofpromotion
that the College uses is symptomatic ofthat.

i want to conclude by saying that I don't think that I
have a solution for the dilemmas raised in this article. It's
become more clear to me as an individual that what I want
to do is engage with agriculture and be part ofa revitaliza—
tion of rural communities and the food system. But I’m
not sure what exactly this will mean for the College. It
is obvious that the dining hall will play a very important
role in this and that it has the potential to do much more
than it is doing now. A consumer as large as the dining hall
can singleshandedly put a lot of money back into the local
economy and give a lot oflocal growers reason to increase
their production, But what I’ve seen so far is a fundamental
intransigence in the structure of Dining services to hav-
ing a sweeping vision and purpose. Prairie Studies has ob-
viously already shown some of the possibilities of being
meaningfully engaged in place, Other than that, I think
there will need to be a general realignment of the curricur
lum, public programs and other aspects of the academic
program and campus life ifwe ever want to this place to be
the center ofsomething very challenging and momentous.
