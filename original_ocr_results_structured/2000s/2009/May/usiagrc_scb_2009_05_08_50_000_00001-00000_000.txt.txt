Prison program
accredited by
college faculty

EV MARCUS ZEITZ

Through the work of numerous student
and faculty volunteers, the Grinnell Prison
Program has brought the liberal arts to in-
mates at two regional prisons.

This past Monday, the faculty voted
unanimously to grant credits to incarcerated
students at both the Newton Correctional
Facility and the Iowa Correctional Facility
for Women at Mirchellville. The vote also
called for a fare-year pilot program to devel»
op a All-credit Certiﬁcate in the Liberal Arts
for prisoners in the program

“The idea is that 40 credits is just be—
low the number that you can transfer to a
two-year or four~year college when you’re
released,” said Prison Program coordinator
Emily Guenther ’07, “This would give incare
cerared students a really good base ofcredits
that they could transfer."

Tire accredited program builds on the
sbtryear history of Grinncll students and
faculty leaching in the Newton Correctional
Facility. While the resolution was approved
for “qualiﬁed students incarcerated at New—
ton Correctional Facility or [the] Iowa Cor—
rectional facility for Women (Mitchellville),"
the pilot program will only be enacted at
Newton for now.

In order to uualrr‘y for the program, prrsr
oncrs will need a GED or high school diplor
maThc program will increase the number of
courses taught by raculty at the prisons, re-
quiring incarcerated students in the program
to take at least four credits from courses in
social sciences, humanities, and sciences.

“Foi a variety of reasons, the population
in prisons is very receptive to the liberal arts
education. They love to learn, and they’re
unbelievably gratefrrl, and most of all they‘re
just smart," Eric Ritter ’12, who is the Prison

The ofﬁce of Student Affairs recently re
leased shitistics regarding student conduct
hearings on campus, a departure from past see
crccy surrounding student Hearing Council
and judicial Council hearings.

The information discloses the amount of
thefts and hospitalizations on campus, as well
as summaries of student conduct hearings, prev
sented anonymously The full data is available
on vinthhesandbcom.

Dean of Students Travis Greene said that
the decision arose out of a desire to increase
transparency in the process ofdcaling with star
dent conduct violations,

“As a residential liberal arts community,
where self-governance and personal respon-
sibility are hallmarks, it is very appropriate to
share this information with the student COIHT
munity," Greene wrote in the released informar
tion.

Director ofi\CE Security Ben Howort ‘09
initially approached Greene with the idea of
publishing the stars online.

would help inform the campus as to how the

President to leave in July 2010 once unfinished projects at the college complete

in an all-campus e-rnail sent Monday,
May 4, President Russell K. Osgood an-
nounced his intention to step down from
the posrtron of College Prestdent, effective
July 31, 2010.

Osgood, who became president of the
college Aug 1, 1998, has maintained that
he believes a college president should step
down after ten years. However, Osgood will
be staying on with the college for 12 years,
due to unfinished projects during hrs ad
ministration.

“At the 10 year point we had just started
the strategrc plan and we had one major far
cility left to do that we planned to do and
that was the athletic center so it didn’t seem
that that was exactly the right moment [to
r-esigrrl," Osgood said “So now ifl go at 12
years which is my plan, we will frnrslr rt and
Will be almost totally tlone with the Straws
grc plan. So rt’s a logical step,"

Osgood will distance hirnscif in the
search process for a new Presidcut, as he

said that his input could potentially ins
hibit conversation during interviews with
potentral candidates, “People should be
able to sny.'Gec,wl1at i want is someone
not like former guy,' you know?" Osgood
said. “So i think 1 will play no role and I
probably won't comment on it at all. it is
something for the trustees to organize and
I’m sine they’ll want to organize faculty and
students staff but it’s up to them and they
haven’t organized it yet,”

This organiza on of the search com-
mittee will take place at the Trustee retreat
this summer. “Vi/e make the decision about
how the search committee is constituted
and we'll nail down specifrcs on our calene
dar cultivating and frnding candidates over
the course of the summer," David White
’90, Chair of the Grinnell College Board of
Trustees t.

students on the search committee. “While
the Board of Trustees ultimately has final
say on the selection of the next president,
they will be forming a presidential search
committee to render a recommendation to
the Board,” Krejsa said. “In fact, they have
asked for 172 students to sit on this search
committee in equal standing with the ad-
ministration and faculty"lf students would
like to be considered for or would like to
recommend a peer student to the search
committee, contact Krejsa at krejsaja@grins

Osgood, though committed to the next
year at the college, has shown signs that he is
ready to step down. According to SGA Vice
President ofStudent Affairs john Burrows
'10, on Tuesday, May 5, Osgood leaned out
his window in Nollen House and shouted
to the passing-by SGA Cabinet members,
“I’m free!" -

When asted to conuncnt, Osgood corr-
frrmctl Burrows'story. “That is a fair stare-
mcnt," Osgood said.
