one ofdic original 12 founders ofAchan, a looser
ly organized, ungovcrncd and lnﬁlmous internal

die “lniormarion super Highway" and whar is
now commonly/ known as t1lc“Inmmcr/."lms, in

attendance and sums of lzlmcrduck leader of
Movie Maddness, a group orsrudenrs char have
garnered weekly for 12 years in dark rooms on
campus “to dlink a box ofwille and Watch rer-

"It's really amnzing,”Ho said. “1 drink my fie

“I’d warch rbe show bcforc school every day,"
Ho said. “It's an nnironic love—l snu'i:d wirh
