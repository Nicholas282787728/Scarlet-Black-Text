Renewed Relays mix academics with alcohol

This Saturday, 18 teams ranging from liiology to Womr
en’s Water Polo will descend upon MAC Field at ll mm. and
compete in rhc Grinncll Relays, Although the event was not
held last year rn its frril glory, excitement is running high. First
played in 1973,Wayne Moyer, Political science, began the Re»
itys as a way for students to I'clu before frnai cxnms.

“We deerded to make it a parody of the Drake Relays,"
Moyet said. "And rather than cmplmsme tuperecompetrtrvee
tress, make it like a Sunday school picnrc with beer."

Meyer got the idea for the event from his rime at Yale The
first Relays pirred North Campus against south campus in a
number ofdrinkingrrclntcd evenrs. A weekend and three kegs
ofbecr liitei, ii tiadition was born

“It went over well," Moyei' snid. “\Nc carried it through
till 1987 rind we added some events. the most famous I guess
was the Babe Rrrrh Bar Relay, where you run, put your head on
a baseball bat, go arounri rt 10 tunes end then go back to the
starting point, whreh is a study ofparabolic trajectories. [The]
Trtular Head contest came in at rinrr stage, and it sort of bcr
came a big spring weekend."

In 1937, the Relays were replaced by functions that were
less alcohol centered, because of new state laws. Meyer said
that the Relays just haven't been the same since. The event
came back during the '90s and early '00s but was plagued by bad
weather. This year however, SGA films chnirJeffSinick’O9 has
tried to breath: new life into the 36*yeilrrold tradition.

“The last couple years that I've been here, the Relays have
struggled kind ofa bit,” Sinick said. “Relays the last three years
haven't happened in big, full-fashion forrn as a community
event the way it used to be, so I wanted to

“We came up with an idea on how ro

on academic departments instead of being

to include professors, community members

Women’s water polo hosts
conference championship

BY MAX CALENBERG

After a bevy ofrough matchllps and a long
season, the Grinncll women’s writer polo team,
the Black Sheep, took fifth in the Heartland
Conference Tournament Sunday.

The team began the tournament with a
12.9 loss to Lindenwood University, the ream
that eventually frnished in second place.

“Lindenwood recruits players from around
the world," said Co»Captn‘m Muri Guttmnn
’09. “it is a very intense level of
polo, and that we hold our-
own against them makes me
very proud.”

After playrng Lrndene
wood, the team only had a
couple of hours before hopping
into the pool against eventual
champion Carleton College, who
defeated the Black Sheep 1074.

Despite the losses, team members
said that they went out and performed to
the best of their abilities.

“I feel like this weekend just
summed up [our season] re-
ally well," said Leah Krandel
’09. “When we won our third
game, there wasn't much drfference between
the games we lost and the games we won, after
each game people had positive things to say
and we were proud of how we performed. 1
thi k that speaks to how amazing this team
is.

With the season coming to an end, the
Black Sheep are about to become a very young
team, as five players will graduate this year,
leaving only a couple of juniors. orthe many
ﬁrstrycnrs who joined this season, experience
ranged from never playing before to six years

on a club team. Despite the squari's youth,
team CerCaptain Josie Sefr'o9 sees plenty of
promise for the future.

“I think that the freshman have n ton of
potential," 5ch said. “This season was really
good for them."

Many players have noticed a considerable
gain of experience through the season, espe»
eialiy those who never played before joining
the team.

“ltwas definitely a challenge; you don’t to
acrly know what to do,” said frr-sr-rime goalie

Hannah Lytlc ’11. “But it becomes a
blast once you know what rs going on."
Unlike many other water polo
teams, the Black Sheep do not hitve
an ofﬁcial coach, instead cit
thcr utilizing volunteer
couches from the
men’s team,
[1']: Wild
Turkeys. or
coaching
each other.
“We fire a
sclfrconched team
and we are going
against teams in Conference that have full-
timc coaches,” said Alex Pain ‘10. “And we are
starting the season with nearly half our team
never having played before.”

With a mix of players with various levels
of experience, the team is looking forward to
what the future may bring.

"At the end ofthe season,1 felt we'd really
come together as a team,” said Megan Januska
’12. “And it happened a lot faster here than it
ever did in [high school]. It makes me really
excited for the next three seasons."

years have three biology professors, Gregg
Whitworth, Shannon HinsarLeasurc and
Elizabeth Quenthcm on their team.

"It took n littlc convincing," Koid said.
“They were waiting for one prof. to say yes,
and then the other two said yes."

“One had to make the big step and then
the others followed,"Hcllmich said.

But once the team was together. they
were able to conccnliatc on moi: important matters. like the

competition cry," Hellmich said. “But that wasn't science-y
enough so we looked at the scientific name,A. cepa."

Despite their name,tho A. cepas arejust looking forward to
raking part in tire Grinncil tradition. They just want to have
fun and see their professors and classmates in a non-academic
setting.

“We thought it would b: a really good opportunity to get to
know these profs outside of thrlt environment," Koid said. “And
this week is really rough for a lot of peep]: so going out there
would be really nic: and dcrstressing."
