Midnight=nerd nirvana

For nerds, there is nothing quite like a midnight re—
lease. It is our Super Bowl. Grinnellians compare stress
levels and page counts. Nerds compare midnight release
experiences. The privileged feeling you get a few hours
later, knowing that no one else has seen or read what you
have, that’s like crack for us.

Two years ago, I bought “Harry Potter and the Death-
ly Hallows” at midnight in canada, simply so that I could
get rhe British edition. Well, and because the nearest
bookstore in rural upstate New York took me across the
border to Brockv'llle, Ontario.

Normally, I’d just take the boat over and call in to Cus-
toms. But there were two problems. one, my 14efoot
outboard motorboat had no lights, Two, docking in the
harbor isn't free after 9 pm.

Being cheap,I drover The Custom officer on the me
ternarional budge was less surprised rhan I might have
hoped. So much for getting any affirmation of my nerdie

ness Even walsc,l wasn’t even the ﬁrst one there. Two
Canadian teenagers—sisters who had been first in line at
this bookstore SlnCB the fourth book—and an American
doetor wirh his devoted 14-year»old daughter had beaten
me.

We killed time by discussing each other’s governe
ments, sharing pizza and soda. Other people started
showing up around 11 pm, a number of whom found it
necessary to remind me that not all Canadians are named
Alanls or Avril.

l was the third person in Brockville to buy the book
and the second person to drive back across the border
with it. Six hours later, I went downstairs for breakfast.
Grandma remarked that I was up early when aetually,I
had finished Harry Potter instead of sleeping. I was not
allowed to talk to anyone for several days

So I've got transportation issues, international cama-
raderie, free pizzas and excessive fan speculation. one
problem, though: no costumesl It's my biggest shame as a
ncrd—I have never dressed up for a midnighr release, and
therefore cannot count myself as a supernerd, no matter
how many lines I can quote or how many times I've read
a book.

Luckily, May 1 brings “XeMen Origins: Wolverine"
and on May 3, StarTrek arrives, And I’m finally prepared
with costumes for both.

After dissolving into fangirl squeals during the first
trailer showing Gambit, the card-throwing Cajun,l reale
ized my chance had finally come. I have in my dresser
a black turtleneck with the magenta and blue trademark
and the Sharpie abs. In my closet. there’s a floorelength
trenchcoat. I've already destroyed a deck of cards by
throwing half of them at drunk people at Harris, and l
have a lighter to fake my mutant powers.

Sophomore year for Mary B. James, the captain
(Anna Werner ’09) and I dressed as Captain Picard and
Commander Riker, so I've already got the full star Fleet
uniform. Yes, it’s the wrong era for this movie, but I don't
care. It’s Star Trekmtime travel is never out of the ques-
(Ion.

While a midnight release at The Strand full of
Grinnellians might not measure up to the epic nature of
the final Harry Potter, a costume brings it close. Besides.
if you won't dress up like a mutant or a Star Fleet com-
mander for your favorite cultural obsession, is it really
worth it?

Students and pros combine for Spring Dance

Performance to fuse dance and video to create an interactive experience

BY SARAH BLACK

This weekend's spring Dance Performance includes a
senior MAP production by Noga Ashkenazi '09 and some of
the mosr ambitious multimedia dance performances to date,
In addition to Ashkenazi’s pieces. the four-part, 45-minute
production features students performing choreography by
guest instructors Arr Bridgman and Myrna Packcr— bor-
rowed from their New York dance company— and Shawn
Womack,Theatre.

Along with Jaysen Wright‘s '09 “Ties That Bind," the
Spring Dance Performance honors the Theater and Dance
Departments goal to use the year’s fourth main stage pro-
duction to develop and display student pieces alongside
work from guest artists.

“It's a laboratory for new work," Womack said. “Two of
the works presented are MAPs by seniorTheatre majors."

Womack specifically emphasized the importance of
combining student work with that of professional artists.

"It's important for us to bring guest artists in dance to
work with students,"Womack said, "but it's oi'primary Ems
portancc that we offer students opportunities to create their
own work."

“It feels like such an achievement for our department
to have two MAP performances and for the quality of at-
tention that the students have given to their artistic work,"
Womack continued. “Both Noga and laysen are very clear
in their vision and very clear in articulating their vision for
what they want."

Ashkenazi's nvonart MAP includes “Dangerous Calm,"
which features 15 dancers, and a solo piece titled “Long Dir
tance," which Ashkcnazi will perform. Both works incorpo-
rate video shot by Ashkennzi near her home in Israel over
winter break.

“[For "Dangerous Calm"], I ﬁlmed in the Israeli desert
by the Dead Sea and in a construction site in Tel Aviv,"Ashs

kenazi said. “I'm working with those two places that seem
very differentidesert versus city I'm trying to bridge the
gap between these two spaces and show a vision in which
they’re not that different. I wanted the video to inform the
dance just as much as the dance will inform the video."

Her solo piece, “Long Distance," uses film shot on an lse
raeli bus. Ashkenazi began working on the solo while taking
film and dance courses during her study abroad experience
in Paris last year.

“I’ve been doing film for many years,"Ashkenaai said, “so
editing wasn't new to me. But it was challenging in terms of
projection formats and working with Roberrs' space and rhe
projector they had there, so it wasn'r 100 percent smooth but
[not] too complicated either."

Bridgman and Packer held rehearsals for "Traveling
Feast," the program’s final place, over ten days in January
and returned for two days of work last week, Womack con-
ducted rehearsals in the interim,some ofwhlch incorporated
the choreographers via Skype.The piece will use a live video
feed to project half of the dancers onto the backs of coats
Worn by the other five performers.

“It’s been a real challenge,” Aniko Drlik-Muehleck ’11
said. “You have to get the spacing so precise so that the ride
co isn't distorted when it’s projected. It takes a lot of extra
little marks on the stage and moving around to try and get
it right."

“We're working with a couple different projectors, so that
makes things a little more complicated" Anna Logan ’09
said, "It’s taken more time in tech rehearsals, but I think the
pieces come out looking more unique. We're doing things
more multimedia than dance usually is and I think it looks
very cool,"

The Spring Dance Performance continues with shows at
8 pm. tonight and Saturday, along with a 2 p.m, matinee on
Sunday in Bucksbanm's Roberts Theater.
