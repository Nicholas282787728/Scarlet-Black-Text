Foundations of LGBTQ studies, from a more personal perspective

Sara Montolla ’10 applies knowledge from the classroom to her personal life and makes a shocking discovery

About two weeks ago, 1 read a book for my
“Foundations of LGBTQStudics" class that
changed my life forever: “A Desired Past: A
Short History of Same-Sex Love in America"
by historian Leila J. Rupp 1 would have pres
ferred to read a book titled "A Desired Present"
or, better yet, “A Desired Future”, since I will
be graduating in eight months But, from the
first sentence of the book] went from wonderr
ing, “What
the hell am I
going to do
with my life?”
to “What the
hell is my
mom doing
with her life?”
I should have known from the title and cover
of "A Desired Past” that this was not an or
dinary history book, especially since it started
with a personal story.

Rupp opens by explaining that her “Aunt
Leila has lived with a women for as long as
[she can] remember,” in fact, “they were just
like a married couple."They lived in the same
house and shared the same room, although
they had twin beds. As I read more about her
aunt, my stomach sank as if it were becomr
ing a black hole. Then,l felt as if my whole
body were being sucked into that black hole as
memories of my mother and her “best friend”
started to ﬂash in front ofmc like a VHS tape

gone wild. Then the comparisons between
“heterosexual" couples and my mother's relar
tionship with her “best friend" began to run
through my head—they slept in the same bed
for over eight years, raised the daughter other
“best friend" together, paid their bills together
and have always been inseparable,

I decided to tell some ofmy friends about
m sus icions and to m sur rise they were
unalarmed!
One of
them even
smiled and
said, “Umm,
I have ale
ways wonr
dered about
your mom’s ‘best friend’. You always mention
her when you talk about your mom.”1 guess
it is true. They are not only physically inc
separable, but their names are inseparable in
conversationsl I could not believe that I was
the only one who had never questioned my
mom‘s sexuality. 1 think it became normal to
constantly associate my mother with her “best
friend,"since they have lived together for over
ten years; it never seemed strange to include
her "best friend" in my family's decisions and
future plans,

Before I came out to my mother,l seriously
thought she would kill me if she knew about

my attraction to women. I am part of a consetr

vativc Christian family that owns three Evanr
gclist churches and preaches all over Central
and South America. I mean, we are conrsetr
va-tivc. Growing up, women in my family were
never allowed to wear pants, makeup, jewelry
or listen to secular music or dance. But nowI
thinkl understand why my mother could cmr
pathize, to a certain point, with my sexuality,
Then again, she has repeatedly said that she
would prefer for me to deny my sevtinl orientar
tion and for her to live a lie, believing thatI will
one day marry a man. She has even said to me,
“I don't understand, Sara, why you would tell
me you were, . .IfI liked women,I would never
tell anyone, let alone my own mother.” But her
love for her “best fricnd"is so strong that] can
only wonder ifshe has ever considered the pos
sibility ofbeing a “lesbian."

After reading the first five pages of “A
Desired Fast," it seemed there was no ques
tion about it: my mom was gay and she would
never admit it. However, Rupp later indicates
how necessary it is to have terms that help us
better understand that love and sexuality do
not always have a direct relationship to sexual
identity. She also introduces the concept of
“romantic friendships" as “passionate, intense,
loving, physically affectionate relationships"
between people of the same sex. At this point
in my reading, it seemed my momma could fit
underneath the umbrella of the term "queer,"
under a subrlabel of lesbian known as “semi-

romantic friendship." In other words, “my
mom is gay."

Does my mom’s intense love {or her “best
friend"automatically define her as a “lesbian?"
But what if a woman has never had sex with
another women? Is she still considered a “lesr
bian"Y Could she be “bisexual?" Or is she just
“lesbian"who does not know it, or is in denial?
Should society be allowed to identify her as
a “lesbian" when she herself does not identify
that way? So what exactly does it mean to be
a “lesbian?" Maybe a general “queer identity"
fits better, but if so, what’s the equivalent of
"queer” in Spanish? At the end, who is ben—
eﬁting from stamping a label on my mother‘s
forehead? Her? My family? Society? The Gay
community? Me?

As 1 kept on reading,I realized that sexual
orientation is not a multiplication chart where
the results are deﬁnite. The thing is that the
"sexual orientation equation,” which deter-
mines sexual identity, contains multiple vari—
ables and coefficients, such as gender, culture
and language to name a few. The definition
of sexual identity is much more complex than
many people tealize.1 will be using this space
to write about issues of gender, sexuality and
culture through my own experiences in my
personal and academic lire.

Livin’ the dream: the first steps to a life well-lived

Tim Hederman ‘10 advocates embracing your teenaged past, whether it is “teeny bopper" or “teen angst”

Yes, this column is going to be called Livin‘ the Dream. Yes,
it is a corny mantra that began as ajoke, has made its way to my
Facabook page and will eventually be relegated to the categori-
cally bloated and overaealous. But for the beneﬁt ofyour read-
ing pleasure, let's just go ahead and assume that there are many
facets to such an endeavor and that in the end, ourjoint venture
in achieving Dreams Lived-edncss will be cl fruitful onc. Ifthat

A response to last week's inquiries
Mr. Crosby,

Your letter is brimming with the very questions liberal arts
students are constantly asking themsclves, and we were pleased
to read your inquiry Indeed, knowledge and morality have of-
ten been pitted against each other in an eternal war through hu-
man history. Nearly every human accomplishment or discovery
has dual potential to help or harm.Just within the past decade
We have seen immunology and biological weapons, commer—
cialjctlincrs and ﬁghter planes, atomic energy and atomic war-
heads, ncw materials and new sources of pollution. Scientific
progress is often a double-edged sword and liberal arts students
ask ourselves how can we bend it toward moral utility.

You raise the question of whether ethics and morality are
“taught" in the classroom, whether it be math or psychology

or whatcvcr else, and the answer is simpleﬂften it is not.
Our professors do not tell us what is right and what is wrong.
Instead, we are constantly probed and pressed, whether in the
classroom or outside ofit, to critically analyee the application of
our knowledge. And from that, we derive the ethics and morals
that you mentioned in your letter.

It is easy to look at the many failures of human morality,
be they genocide, war, or simply doing nothing in the face of
poverty and inequality, This View, however, leaves out the many
things that Grinnell students, and liberal arts students, as a
whole have gone on to accomplish with regards to the quest of
addressing these ethical and moral problems you raise. Many of
us, in fact, have used questions similar to yours as a launching
point for change, be it civil disobedience, altruistic journeying
or whatever it takes to make this world a little bit morejust.

Your letter, in and otitsclr, shows that even if pieces of the
educational system may not dirccrly address moral concerns,
ethics discussions take place everywhere on campus.

And, in regards to your question about the government's
often unjustified Crackdown on mood-altering drugs, we can
speak for a large portion ofcampus that didn’t respond to your
letter by saying "Yeah, man, shit sucks." We invite you to con»
tinue this dialogue with us in whatever ways you can.
