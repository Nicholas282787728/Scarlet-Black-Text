What direction do you think some ofthese shows are goe
ing to go in the new administration? How are they going to
deal with almost this ‘problem' of Obama as candidate that
they would be favomble towards?

I think the answer to that question comes out of what role
does news satire play in our society. There are a few things
that news satire does really well. one thing it does is lainpoon
newsmakers. so even though to the Obnmn administration, at
the presidential level, there will still be stories at the national
level of newsrnakers vrolatrrrg What we consider appropriate
behavior in our culture And certainly what's going on in the
whole Illinois state government with Rod [Blagojevich] will
be fodder for them, and the normal partisan bickering will be
fodder for them, and the first steps that the Obama adminis

tration will make will be made fun of.

In fact, one of the particular things that “The Daily Show”
has made fun ofalready here in the early days of the admin~
istration is the fact that some of Obama’s rhetoric about the
economic situation and also about international relations
sounds eerily like things that Bush said. Of course the media
have been critical of the things Bush said, but when it comes
out of Obama’s mouth, everyone seems to give him a free
pass on that, except ofcorrisc “The Daily Show." So I‘ll think
they'll be ok.

It seems like satire deﬁnitely does hold the media ac
count
able to some extent, but does it actually help people become
informed? I remember that there was a test that was ad-
ministered to Daily Show viewers versus traditional news
viewers that said they had a better grasp
of “real news”

There's definitely a correlation
between viewership and being informed
about current eventsTo say there’s a cnu-
sation, that “The Daily Show"will make
you better informed about current events,
that's a dangerous one to inake.The
research that I looked at, combined with
what 1 read about how satire functions, I
think the reason that audience is better
informed is because they’re better news
consumer-s and fairly cynical as well.

The viewership docs skew younger
and docs skew more to people being
better informed about current events
The reason for that is that “The Daily
Show" otThc Onion, ifrhey‘rc going to
reference a news Smr)’, they need to make sure it has traction,
that is, the story has lasted for more than one news cycle. Ifa
story has legs, chances are you've heard about it, whether it's
on the internet or televrsion or people have blogged about it or
Twrtteied about it.When you see it lampooned, they’re taking
that generally known information and presenting their com»
mentaiy on it, in a satirical way. There are some stories on Tue
Onion and “The Daily Show"th:it fall flat because the item
they are referencing is not really known and therefore it’s not
something that’s going to resonate with the audience

it seems, though, in the profiles of“The Daily Show“
that I’ve read that these people are sort ofpolicywonlrish
kind ofpeople who are really interested in being in—
formed citizens. They'd like to ﬁnd their own perspective on
these things, so they have to kind of“know more" than their
audience to some extent.

sure, that's a good observation, Satirists are making social
commentary The whole reason that they’ve chosen to present
their case is because there’s some sort ofrmplicit social norm
that’s being violated. Rather than criticize in a straight ahead
way, let’s take for example something like CBS misreport-
ing information about Bush’s service.They had created this
forgery ofBush’s military service The way “The Daily Show”
made fun ofir was actually really clever: they related it to
Bush's misinformation about going into the Iraq War.
50 in the satire, and this was reported by stephen Colbert, he
uses the language that Bush used, but was talking about the

CBS case, It was a case ofdouble irony, I would argue that
this reaction from “The Daily Show" is saying that the media
needs to be more diligent about its sources, and also that the
media shouldn't take what the president says at first blush.

So this exhibits how they’re coming from a perspective
oftrying to inject more knowledge into the public sphere, to
some extent?

Right. But what’s interesting is that satire is vely effective
because you're not just directly criticising the person. It's let—
ting the audience make their own conclusions.The weakness
as a means ofrhetoi‘icnl argument or affecting changers that
there is ambiguity, Sometimes people don't get the internal
meaning. They take it at face value and it ends up coming up
short as satire.

For cxample,“Tlie Daily Show"ll\mpoons the media often.

In 2004, before the c1ections,]on Stewart
happened to appear on “crossfire“with
Paul Beglilli mid Tucker Carlson And
as he came onto “Crossfiie,” he said to
Paul and Tucker, “stop what you’re doing,
you‘re hurting America. you’re bickering,
and what America really needs you to
do rs repair the news and debate policy."
And they‘re like,“No, no, we debate facts!”
And he said, no, “you bickei,you present
one side, and their the other, and then you
brcker.”And they didn’t take it too well,
Tucker Cailsori in particular became
very meanrspirited with Jon Stewart.
‘ At one point, he says to jon,“Be ﬁrnny."
Anti Jon says,“l'in noryour monkey."jon
clearly rhinlts that the media isn’t doing
their job, but when he comes right out and says that, the me—
dia doesn't rake it too well. so satire is far more entertaining
for the viewer, and much easier on the media, than trying to
assert these social values out loud.

I guess I was a little conﬂicted about that moment. I
wondered why people couldn’t just change the channel or
turn oﬁdie T.V.

It’s a good question, and I would argue based on the
audience for those three networks, CBS, FOX, and NBC,
and I haven’t looked at the ratings recently, but you know,
day to day the viewership is under a million a day. 1 would
argue people are already peeling away, people don‘t find the
everyday programming of those shows to be relevant to their
daily lives. I think what jon was trying to do, and I hesitate
to speak for him, but both he and the executive producer of
"The Daily Show” have been interviewed about the incident
on “Crossﬁre,” and they kind ofmade the decision on the cab
ride over there that this was the rack they were going to rake
and the approach they were going to take, and they called it
“naked reprobation" of“crossfire" for being what they are. If
you watch the clip on the internet, you'll see how awkward
it is: the audience is uncomfortable, Paul was uncomfortable,
Tucker \ws uncomfortableJon was uncomfortablc.We as
humans do not like to get criticized, because we think we're
right all the timeireasonable, intelligent people.

Open Forum brings Trustees, students together

BYHEIDICONNER

Grinnell students and Trustees have at times different
perspectives and interests regarding the College's future. The
SGAesponsored Trustee-Student Open Forum attempts to
bridge this gap by allowing students to share concerns and
interests with some of the College’s most important decision
makers.

This upcoming week, a group of 25
Grinnell College Trustees will come from
across the country to convene for the annual
winter meeting Feb 5 through 7,

At the forum, the first hour will be devote
ed to formal presentations by several groups,
yet to be confirmed. Following this, students
and Trustees will have the opportunity to mingle and discuss
issues of importance to students who presentetl as well as those
who post posters regarding other issues. SGA President Neo
Morake’09 said she estimates that 10 to 15 groups will present
either formally or with posters.

Emily sriever ’09, a former Voicebax administrator, said
she sees the forum as an important opportunity for students
to educate and inform Trustees about campus issues, such as

The ﬁsm/ downturn l5 (1 ”(no/r
lenge for the Budget (mm/nee,”

Trustee Laura Ferguson

last year's windetutbine project, which stiever said would likely
not have passcd without the forum. Presentations can “make a
difference in whether or not the administration gives serious
attention to a concern,”she said.

Several groups will be presenting to the Trustees this year.
Jared Rubinstein '10, a member ofStudents for Responsible Int
vesting (SR1), a group that encourages the
College to vote on which companies the
endowment is invested in, hopes to garner
support for their project from the larger
group of Trustees.

Leah Krandel ’09 and Latona Giwa ’10
will be presenting as representatives of the
newlytformed Social Justice Peer Educat
tion Program, which attempts to increase student awareness of
diversity issues on campus, Giwa said she hopes that the forum
will draw attention to and cultivate interest in the program, and
said that the Trustees offer a “perspective of the College’s his
tory ofdealing with diversity.”

Tiustec Lauia Feiguson ‘90, Chair of the Committee on
Student Affairs and a member of the Budget Committee, said
that she "always looks forwlird to the time slot” and that Trust—

ees “love the open Forum."

While the open Forum has become a tradition, last see
mestei- there was not a designated time for snidents to present
proposals to the Trustees Instead, students and the Trustees
watched a Vice-Presidential debate.

As usual, members of SGA cabinet will also have opportu-
nitics to present strident view points to the Trustees. Morake
will speak to trustees on what she said was similar to the State
of the College, and Treasurer Emily Wax '09 will represeirr stu-
dents on the Budgetary Committee.

According to Ferguson, the current financial situation will
be of higher priority than usual during the upcoming Board
meeting. Normally the Trustees approve the budget at the Feb
ruary meeting, but they will not vote on the budget until their
April meetingThe fiscal downturn is a “challenge for the End
get Committee and Board as a whole," Fergnrson said, but said
otherwise the meeting will proceed as normal.

An overview and agenda ofthc upcoming meetings will be
posted and circulated throughout campus early next week and
on Feb 10, a summary of the official actions of the Trustees
meetings is set for release.
