Rachel Fields ’09

BY CliLOlaMotm.

In the heyday of Nickelodeon '90s television, the show
“Are You Afraid of the Dark" scaled kids across the country.
In her blog, Rachel Fields ‘09 takes a retrospective look at
this once-terrifying series and points out cveiy ﬂaw,plotthole,
and absurdity that the show has to offer. “Have you seen the
one with Tia and Tamara when they turn into chameleons?
1 mean, what? They turn into fieaking chameleons," Fields
said.

The blog, titled, “I call this storszhe Tale oftlic Gaping
Plothole,”was created over the suminei of2008, after Fields
had spent time reading a blog ofa similar nature. “There was
a period of my life when 1 had a lot of free time, And 1 was
slightly obsessed with this Goosebumps review biog,” Fields
said. “The author of that blog wrote synopses and they were
funny so I decided I wanted to do something like that."

Though Fields had originally planned to also post about
literatur87 contemplating a site about the children’s series
The Boxcar Childrenishe eventually settled on “Are You
Afraid of the Dark” and was able to watch many of the Cpl’
sodes on YouTube.

Despite its auspicious beginnings, l-‘ields eventually abane
doned the blog. "I stopped because I realized my posts were
like 20 pages long and I figured it was totally like a waste
because maybe nobody was reading it,"Fields said.

Since then, Fields has continued to think up other blog
sites; she once thought to create a blog about middle school
motintional posters. “In my math class there was this poster
where there was a monkey in a jail cell and it said, ‘We all
make mistakes.’And I was like .so we all make mistakes and
then we go to jail?” said Fields. “This monkey is in jail. Can
he get on parole? It's very troubling."This biog never came to
fruition as a result of the lack of available images.

Currently, Fields has a biog directed towards poetry, The
blog consists ofsome ofFields’favorite poems,and poetry that
her friends enjoy as well. “I think a lot of people are scared of
poetry, so I thought if there was just a way to wade through
the bad stuffand go straight to the good, people would like it
more,"Ficlds said. “So I’m doing that seek to bring joy"

Mallory Inman ’09

BV MANDO MONTANO

Mallory lnman '09 first started blogging when she and
friend Sidoiiie Stiaughnrlvlorse ‘os spent the summer of
2007 in Giinncll. Then collaborative blog, “Iowa Summel"
began asjust a fun side proieet.

“Wejust blogged about little things, like things we cooked
or things we made." lnman said.

But when the summer ended. Inman went to study abroad
in Germany and Straughl‘rl‘dotsc went to Poland. The two
wanted to keep in touch, so they made ajornt biog chronicling
their time abroad. “We were sad about the ﬁrst blog ending,
but we weren’t in Iowa, and it wasn’t summer,” Inman said. “
So we started a new project."

This new project, “Making Places," was created so lniiian
and StraughnrMorso could keep in touch with each other
outside ofGtinnell. “We both wanted to share what we were
doing with each other so that how the travel blog was started."
Inman said.

lnman's and StraughnrMorse's posts range from what sort
of exotic dish StraughirMorse ate in Warsaw to lnman's pier
tures ofevcryday life in Germany

“My favorite part of[Making Places] is getting the chance
to think about little events and moments in my life in a wayl
wouldn't otherwise,”lnman said.

“Making Places" sparked other blogs for lnman, such as
her own personal blog, “Poems About Onions"and one about
vegan dishes, “Palace Eats”.

“Poems About Onions,” is a random post blog where she
posts random pictures, recipes, or reflections on her day. "Pale
ace Eats" is a new blog where Inman and her other houscr
mates document the vegan food dishes they prepare.

"[Blogging] is a really cool medium that you can shape to
what you want it to be,"1nman said.

Andrew Walsh ’09

BY CHLOE Moron.

“Who or what has been the most ticklish this week? It
could be youl”

This is the tagline to the blog of Andrew Walsh ’09. His
biog, “Tickle City," is a less conventional approach to blog-
ging. “I started it last spring as a result offr‘tends with blogs,"
Walsh said. “But I didn’t want to do a mundane journal-entry
style blog."

Instead, Walsh bequeaths an award to one deserving en-
tity. “Every award winner gets the phrase, ‘ ,you are
Tickle City!’ at the end of their post," Walsh said. “It’s the
blog's trademark."

Walsh has helpfully listed the Webster’s deﬁnition of the
words “tickle” and “city" on a sidebar on the blog, but the use
oftbe two words together originated colloquially with Walsh
and his friends.“lt's definitely a favorable thing. Like exciting,
agreeable, ticklish," Walsh said. “It's an actual deﬁnition of
the world tickle, but it's a pretty obscure definition."

As it’s an obscure deﬁnition, it makes sense that no speciﬁc
category is applied to who or what is “Tickle City." Currently
in week 22, “Tickle City" has given out awards varying from
the Carmel United U23 Socccheam to David Arscneault'O‘}.
“It started being Grinnellrspecific,but1 tried to make it less
that way,”W:ilsh said.

In an effort to expand the scope ofhis biog, Walsh wrote
about an experience he had over the summer at the Iowa Irish
Fest. “A lot of my friends went to Lollapalooza but I went to
the Irish Fest and it was like 85 and I had a great time,”Walsh
said, “1 posted about it on Tickle City and it got a bunch of
comments from people outside ofthe Grinnell community, so
it’s reaching a more widespread audience."

Walsh has also used "Tickle City” as an outlet for more
serious discourse. A recent post grew out of a paper Walsh
had written about the one Laptop Per Child initiative. Aft
ter posting his research on “Tickle City,“ he received a lot of
feedback, and was contacted by Director of Media Relations
Cindy Dcppe about the post.

“I used [Tickle City] to get out my paper in a less formal
setting,"Walsh said.“Had it not been for'l‘ickle City, it prob
ably would have just slipped through the cracks."

Simpson discusses son, kitchenware

liY MANDO MoNTaNo

Erik Simpson, English, has a PhD from an Ivy League
University and a published book analyzing the literary signihe
cancc ofposts. Now, Simpson can add activc bloggcr to his long
list of accomplishments.

Simpson first started blogging on GrinneliPlans, but then
realized he was putting a lot ofeffort into his posts. He decided
to create a blog sitc separate from GrinncLlPlnns in order to
allow for greater organization and the ability to refer back to
old posts at a later date. In Simpson's six different blogs, his
topics range from musings on literature to his young son Pete's
drawings.

In his blog, Underlying Logic, Simpson discusses everyday
life and random thoughts. For example, one day he expressed
his opinions on senator Joe Lieberman—the next he writes
about his kitchenware.

Two out or six of Simpson's blogs include his son. “Studio
91o: The Art ofPetei Simpson” is a collection of Peter Simpr
son's drawings,which include Eiik Simpson’s iii-depth analysis

of his son’s work. in the other blog, “Pete Potato," Simpson
tclls stories about his son. In the most recent post, Simpson
convinces his son that smoke detectors are supposed to help
the family.

For Simpson, blogging about his son is not only a way to
show his family what Pete has done, but is also used for his
son to look back on, like his parents did when he was younger.
“My own grandparents gave me their little notes and anecdotes
from when l was a kid.When I turned 21. I think, I was really
touched by that, so I imagine being able to give my son the
same thing,“ Simpson said.

To Simpson, blogging moves beyond just the storage of
memories and ideas, it facilitates the communication of ideas
and thoughts at an increasingly rapid speed. “When I write
something in a blog. I’m trying to participate in a really new
public conversation among people who are thinking seriously,
out loud, in public. about issues that they might have talked
about by phone or by letter in the past," Simpson said.
