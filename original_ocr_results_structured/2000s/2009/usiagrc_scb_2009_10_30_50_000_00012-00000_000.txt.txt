OKTOBERFEST [N THE DINING HALL:
Oh/ sweet German holiday of beer and
greasy sausages. Wait. Where’s the beer?
Oh, it’s in the Hot Beer Soup...

OCTOBER: Oh/ sweet month of beer
and greasy sausages and cold weather
and way too much rainiget out of here.

October 31, 1958

A 55200 increase in the compree
hensiVe charges at Grinnell next
year was passed by the Board of
Trustees at a meeting this week...
But even those students who pay
the full Charge of $1,650 are being
subsidized this year by about $1,000.

 

 

 

 

Students speak
about what’s on
their minds in 142
words or fewer,
and you’re invited!
if you have a rant,
e-mail it to
[blochweh]. Com-
plaining in a public
forum is always
more fun than do-
ing it alone.

November won’t be better, though.

 

The library IS a quiet Space, kids
To everyone who think its duty to have n
full’volume conversation in n lihmy: it’s not,
Perhaps you didn’t know this (or didn't take the
time to judge your surroundings), but a library is
SUPPOSED to ho quici, ml by going to the sci»
ence library 01‘ Builing and talking, you are dis-
respecting other people’s choice to a quiet study
space. I don‘t understand your obsession with the
talking in libraries when there are tons of cl ,_
rooms and computerlnhs on campus that are not
necessarily qilict spaces—one you can (all; laugh
or even yell as loud as you want! So next rime you
want to answer your phone talk to your friends
loudly, or Slcype (yea, [hill happened), PLEASE
pick somewhere else besides one of the libraries.

This campus is haunted by ghosts
