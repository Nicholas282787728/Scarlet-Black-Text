Soccer despite injuries

BY KATHERINE CHUNG

The women's soccer team played their first
game of the season on Tuesday against St.
Olaf College, resulting in a 7.1 defeat.

“The outcome ofthe game against St. Olaf
was rough,” midfielder Lara Meyer '11 said.
“But we were able to take a lot from it. We
see where we need to improve and what we
did well."

opponent St, Olaf held the advantage of
returning 10 of 11 starters from last season
while Grinncll lost seVen graduated seniors
and many current players to various injuries.
The team is using the loss as a teaching tool
and looking ahead to the next game.

“Our coaching staff is looking at the game
tape and determining where we need to focus
training in the next two
days as we prepare for the
University of Dubuquc,"
head women's soccer
Coach Heather Benning
said,

The team considers the
first game a starting point
from which to improve
upon during the entire
season,

“This is a new group."
Benning said. "We gradur

current team is still estab

and my expectations for the squad are that we
get stronger with each week of tmining.”

During the start of the season, players felt

the vivacious leaders of 2008, resulting in an
unfamiliar calm that greeted the team. The
missing players were especially apparcar last
week, when a squad of only 12 players tied a
scrimmage 272 against more than 30 members
ofthe Luther College team.

Since then, the returning players have
been “fining up to take leadership positions
and Itccping the talk up," derender cynrhia
Dominguez ’12 said, “The team is deﬁnitely
still growing,"

Although the ﬁrst game was a “tough

“We have a lot ofyounger people who need
to step up right away and fill in the voids that
the seniors left," Dominguez said, “but that's
not something we can't overcome." Benning is
excited about the solid group of first years.

“A handful at [ﬁrst years] are already mak-
ing a difference in game situations," Benning
said. “[Dcfcndcrs] Kathryn Hardy '13 and
Nicole Sipﬂc '13 each gave us 90 minutes in
rho opening game and [midﬁelder] Rachel

Under the direction of Benning, whose
coaching style reﬂects positivism and a strong
work ethic according to her players, the team
has high hopes. Some technical strengths of
this year's team include speed, a strong de-
fense, controlled play and
smart passes.

“My hope for rhe sea
son is that we take pride
in the details becoming
a solid technical team,"
Benning said. “Ifwe can
do that, it will open op—
tions for us tactically, al-
lowing us to be successful

Grinnell College

rhc game H).

“I am really excited about the upcoming
game againsr Dubuquc," goalie Laura Mch ,
roy’ll said. “1r will give us the chance to play
good soccer and to improve on things from
our opening match. We will also be able to
continue building and working together as a
team in order to get ready for our conference
games."

Dominguez is conﬁdent that the team will
make a return to the conference tournament
this year.

“Our team has always been one that has
been focused on depth as far as one player

consistently a strong team no matter who

Solid soccer squad shoots for successful season

After last years success in the Midwest Conference tournament, the Pioneers expect strong season despite season opening loss

BYEMILYBMET

Dcspirc a wealrli of ralenr and experience,
the men lost their season opener 071 to Cent
tral College Tuesday night in Pella. However,
the loss didn't dampen the team’s hopes of
making it to their fourth conference tourna-
ment in a row.

“We have the talent, that’s for sure. We
might be one of the most talented team in
the conference, but it’s all about getting every-
body to work together and using that talent in
the most efficient manner," Captain JP Prouty
‘10 said.

Prouty atrributed the loss Tuesday to the
team’s continuing attempt “to figure out how
to work well with each other and where each
other is going with the ball.”

Along with fellow captains Alex Exarhos
’10, midfielder, and Andrew Stephenson ’10,
forward, Prouty believes that this team has the
potential ro make it to the conference cham—
pionships rhis year if they are able to ovcrr
come these team issues.

“This year is unique because in previous
years we might have had people who didn't
have the best skill for soccer but they would
work extremely hard, whereas this year it’s

like a lot ofskilled players,"l’routy, a defender,
said,

Assistant Coach Parker Koester '09. who
was one of the team's two seniors last year,
believes the team’s strength hasn’t diminished
any from last year’s strong end to the season
when they lost in the conference final to Car-
roll University.

“We have a solid team all around, and I
don't think we have too many weaknesses,"
Kocstcr said. “I think we've got gaiys who will
step up and fulﬁll the few seniors who left."

The returning goalies Greg Fox ‘12 and
Ben Schtmper'll add an important dynamic
to the team, with Fox recording nine saves
against Central. Last year, he completed the
season with 36. In addition to a strong list
of returning players, both Koester and Prouty
believe they have a talented first-year class.

“This talent comes from good recruiting
from coach [Jaworksi]," said Prouty. “He has
done a very good job in the past few years or
bringing in good talenr [such as] rhc really
talented ﬁrstryear class."

One of the ﬁrsrrytar players, midﬁelder
Kanatip Winichakul '13, believes they play
well together due to team unity that occurs on

and offthc ﬁeld.

“We dcﬁnitcly have different things to do
together as a team, so it's been an easy transi-
tion to get to know these guys,"VVinichakul
stud. “I think all of us don't want to let the
team down so we're all pushing each other to
do better.”

Creating chemistry is a major goal of this
year‘s seniors, especially since they had the
same thing done for them when they were
first years.

“Team get-tngcthcrs, parties, that defi—
nitely builds camaraderie," Prouty ’10 said of
bringing together thc Grinnell men's soccer
team. “I admired [the senior captains] my
freshman year just because of how they were
able to include everybody."

The Pioneers have a liomerﬁeld advantage
this year with nine home games including one
against Carroll University, the team the Pior
neers lost to in last year’s Midwest Conference
final.

Last year’s win in the semifinals against St.
Norbert, who they hadn't beaten since 2002,
was a huge boost for this year‘s returning play-
ers.

"My first two ycars we made it to the

tournament, but lost in the semifinal...just
last year we made it to the tournament, won
the semiﬁnal and lost in the final," Prouty
said. “And this year it would be just like going
up a sctofstairs ifwe won the championship.”

In last years conference tournament, the
team beat Saint Norbert in the conference
tournament, only to lose to the Carroll Uni-
versity Pioneers in the final round, staying
positive seems to be a fundamental aspect of
the team this year. According to Prouty', that
will allow them to make the best of any simar
tion, no matter the outcome.

“This senior class, I’m sure, would love
making it to the tournament because that
would be four straight years of going [to the
playoffs]," Proury said. “A huge step in the
right dircction would be winning the con-
ference championship but we've got to lose
the individual mindset, come rogcthcr as a
team and get everybody on rhe righr track, all
thinking the right way with the same goals
and same motivations."

The men’s soccer team plays their first
home game against the University ofDubuque
at 3 p.m. this Saturday.
