While many Grinnell students avoid
Beef Ole and Turkey Tetrazzini, at least
they have the luxury ofcomplaining about
those dishes while eating a nutritious
black bean burger from the vegan bar or
scarﬁng down a cheeseburger {tom the
Honor G Grill.

This summer, the National Assoc
canon of College and University Food
Services (NACUFS) awarded Grinnell
Dining Services with several awards. The
dining hall received awards for diverse
food selection, presentation, and nutris
tional value, including the Grand Prize
in the Concept/Curler category, and the
Silver Prize in Special Event Catering

In order to be judged, each school's
catering company sent in a large binder
filled with recipes and nutritional infor-
mation from their menu. Also included
in the binder were pictures and informas
tion of nutritional presentations given in
the Marketplace, such as the May 7, 2008
event on “The Effects of Carbs, Fats, and
Proteins," and special food events such as
the Chocolate Breakfast of Feb.13, which
featured a chocolate fountain and fresh
fruit.

Grinnell scored highly in the five
categories for the competition including
menu selection, merchandising and pres
sentarion, marketing, nutritional sound~
ness and overall impression. Though the
judges never ate the food from Grinnell
Dining Services, they were impressed.

Onejudge wrote in the comments sec-
tion, “Lots of healthy options I could eat
here all day every day.

“Food' is neat, nutritious, perfectly pre
pared," wrote another.

Terry Waltetsdorf, Assistant Diiec-
tor of Grinnell Dining for Procurement,
offered his opinion on why Grinnell not
only won, beating larger universities such
as the University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,
in the process.

“I really think probably our overall var
riety [was most important in winning],"
Waltersdorfsaid. “I think our push at lo-

In the coming week, Grinnell students
and faculty will have the opportunity to
hear from leading experts in the field of
human rights as they gather for this years
first Rosenfield symposium.

The Rosenfield program in Public Afr
fairs, International Relations, and Human
Rights hosts several symposia each year
and recent topics have included water, in-
carceration in the UtS.,and global pharma-
ccuticals.

“We’re trying to switch things up a he
tle bit and give people a chance to ponder
some of the origins, the theories, and the
importance ofhuman rights,” said program
director Sarah Purcell, History. “And then

both in classes and in other talks".

The Rasenfield Program committee,
which is comprised of faculty and student
members, worked closely with members
of the Crinnell community to choose five
speakers with diverse backgrounds and areas
of expertise.

The speakers include bestselling author
Jane Mayer of the New Yorker, Boston Unis
versity School of Public Health Professor
Michael Grodin, UCLA Professor of H15’
tory Lynn Hunt, Professor at the University
ofDenver’s Graduate School ofInternational
Studies Jack DcnneIIy and Visiting Fellow
and Associate Director ofthe Human Rights
Watch Carol Boggart.

The student response has been positive

David Oponngadce ’12 said. “[But] it's
better than most college campuses."

Upon learning that the judges did not
eat the food for this competition, Opongs
Wadee said, “Most ofit looks better than it
actually tastes.”

Yet the American Culinary Federation
(ACF) may disagree with him, as after eat-
ing the Grinnell dining hall’s chicken with
vodka sauce in a food competition four
years ago, they gave Grinnell a gold medal.
making it the runner—up to enter the nae
tioiial competition.

Grinnell is rare in that it has four ACF
certiﬁed chefs on staff and may soon have
three more.

“We have a very professional staff," said
Grinnell Executive ChcfScottTurley. “They
work hardrthey're proud ofwhat they do."

Alexander Brooks ’10 agrees that the
food is worthy of award. “Based on every
thing i’ve heard about college dining at Oillr
er colleges I certainly think we’re worthy of
the award," Brooks said. "The fact that we
have as much variery as we have I gather is
pretty unusual."

in Rosenfield talks

thus far, particularly about the many differ—
ent perspectives on human rights that the
speakers bring.

“I didn’t know that world health was in-
tegrated into human rights," said Rebecca
Heller ’11. “I think it's really cool because
I just pictured human rights as people in
chains and it’s really neat that they’re making
it really interdisciplinary.”

Purcell commented that she hopes the
symposium will inspire students to consider
the issue of human rights in their own lives.
"I think it would be a good way for {stu-
dents] to connect work that they do in dif-
ferent academic disciplines to their own vcl-
unteer work and their own social activism as
a way to consider those things in relation to
one another."
