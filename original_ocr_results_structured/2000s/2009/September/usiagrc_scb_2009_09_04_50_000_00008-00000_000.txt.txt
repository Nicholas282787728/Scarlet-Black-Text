Student-run arts offer new experiences

Craft room opens doors to extra—curricular art enthusiasts, teaching new, old alike

rsv Kim: BALSER

students who want to develop photogra-
phy, throw pottery, or sew, but avoid art class,
may feel that finding a space to create art
cart be problematieJutting out ofthe loggia
between Harries and James, the craft room
has, for three years, operated as a space for
students to launch themselves into their recr
rearional arts.

Tire craft room is divided between a dark
room, managed by Amanda Underwood
’10 and Jacqueline Blair '12, and a ceramics
station, headed by Rob Zyskowski '10 and
Lindsey Walter ’11.

Use ofthe onerperson dark room comes
complete with the chemicals, paper, 'and
tools necessary {or developing and printing
photos. For students interested in photognk
phy, the dark room is a meditative place to
manually develop photos.

Underwood is willing to give interested
students demonstrations on how to correctly
use the darkroom materials.Thc room holds
three containers where photos are processed
in various chemicals. Further back rs the em
larger, in which the photos are placed and
then translated onto paper. This translation
happens by certain crystals being exposed to
light, thus turning them black. Though this
is just in layman's terms, under Underwood's
direction, even amateur photographers can
learn the ins and outs of developing ﬁlm,
Cameras can be rented for free from the
AV Center for a week at a time, or students
can borrow one of the vintage film cameras
owned by the dark room.

“There are people here to help those who
don’t know how to use a dark room," Una
derwood said. “The charge for materials and
24-hour Peard access is $35 per semester.
There is also storage space for your photos."
Underwood also said that she hopes more
people will use the crrtt room this year.

The charge for the ceramics facilities' is
also S535 per semester This includes use or
four throwing wheels, two kilns, clay and
glazes. There are also monitors on site to

help beginners and to tire ﬁnished preces.
The monitors “can teach you basic throwing,
using clay, recycling, cleaning up and tinding
things," Howort, the former monitor, said.
Howort also emphasized that students can
easily use the pieces they throw.

“All the glazes are food safe," Howort
said. “We mixed the chemicals ourselves"
The ceramics side of the craft room offers a

range ofblue, green. and red glazes although
“we are still looking for a yellow glaze." Ho-
wort said. In addition to the craft room's
regular hours, Howort will also be teaching
a free ceramics class later in the year.
Although there was a craft room open
house on Wednesday, students can still sign
up anytime to use craft room facilities.Thcrc

Off-stage dance breaks classic lines

BYJUMI BELLO

This year, Dance Troupe is shakrng things up. instead of
the usual performances in Bucksbaum, the faculty-directed
dance company will be taking its choreography out into
the public atmosphere to currently unknown sites around
campus, ott campus and even downtown
Grinnell.

Founded in the 1980:, Dance Troupe
was initially housed in the Physical Edut
cation department, only to be rescued by
the Theatre department when it was trans-
formed into its own disciplinary depart-
ment in the humanities division.

Shawn Womack, Theatre, director of
Dance Troupe, has led troupe tor a number
otyears and has watched the groups evolur
[ion This year, instead of performing on
stage, we re going to do site- speciﬁc dances
around campus and ottcampus and into the
town, Womack said There are a number otreasons for
that. One: I think site speciﬁc dance opportunities give the
dancers in Dance Troupe some opportunities to choreo—
graph that aren't so big as perhaps as creating a piece at
the end ofthe semester, It allows students to have choreo-

skill”

”The ski// sets [for Dance
Troupe] are a propensity
for movements a passion
for movement and some

graphic opportunities as well as train with other dancers."

Womack also explained that not all the students in-
volved in Dance Troupe are standard dancers. “Typically,
the students who dance in Dance Troupe are not dance
or Theatre majors. They come from all divisions of the
college. some science majors, som’c set
cial sciences, sorne Religious Studies,"
Womack said. “They usually come to
Dance Troupe with a lot or experience
from high school, but some members of
Dance Troupe have come into the com-
pany with no training at all."

With a diverse background of danc-
ers in the troupe, Womack hopes that
the sitetspecrfre elioreographics and [l‘lC
teamwork involved will produce a were
satrle and unexpected set of dances. “I
think a lot of students come from their
high school experience, knowing dance
in a very particular way, mostly from commercial dance
training But it’s very narrow in a way,"Womack said. “I
think the study of dance in a liberal arts college has to not
just reproduce what is already in oue's dance experience but
look at other possibilities as well."

Theatre

Getting into Dance Troupe is a surprisingly simple task.
The audition is divided into a class and an improvisation.
Womack and her dance associate, Katherine Hurley, like to
see what students can do. “The first part of the dance audi»
tion is a modern dance technique class. We mostly want
to see where people are at, what they physically know in
their bodies, how capable or facile they are with technique.
The second part ot the audition is dance improvisation.
How inventive they are with movement," Womaek s .
“The skill sets are a propensity tor movement, a passion for
movement and some skill."

Though students will soon be discovcring whether they
were accepted into troupe, the locations or their perfor-
mauccs have yet to be ﬁnalised. Womack did slyly Inch»
tion the ﬁrst series of performances will take place at the
beginning or December in Bucksbaum, in recognition of
huckhaums tenth anniversary. This rs to be the year's err
perimcnt.

“[Sighr speciﬁc work] really shakes up our notions as to
where dance is seen and how it is scen,”Womack said. “So,
it we bring it into the public sphere in a number of ways,
I think it points to larger ways or how dance can operate
than just stage performances."
