What the Swedes did get rightrbreeding. These girls
are just as unreal as Danish girls. i think Kaskade says
it best in the lyric, “i’ve got an angel on my shoulder
but a devil in my head.”

September 18, 1942

It’s been a long time
since Grinnell college
has opened in a war
year—not since 1917. . .
Things may happen now
which will surprise us
as much as they do the
youngest prep. We are
no longer in the position
of secure upperclassmen,
sure of ourselves and of
campus events, who may
take into our group, af—
ter a period ofprobation,
another class of fresh—
men.This year we are all,
in a sense, freshmen.

 

LESS PORK VINDALOO: Last year’s go-to Friday dinner ”Slop Du Jour”
was quite revolting It appeared in the Marketplace at the beginning of
this semester. Thank god it hasn’t surfaced too much. , . yeti

 

 

 

HAND-CARVED GYROS: Solid effort, Dick Williams, but the long lines,
the one-by-one service and the imbalanced pita—to—meat ratio made this
endeavor thoroughly mediocre. But your tzatziki sauce was to-die-for.

POLENTA: Year after year, Dining Hall, you serve this up at the vegan
station, When will you learn that even vegans would rather eat pork
vindaloo than these Styrofoam triangles of boiled cornmeal?

Draw on Whiteboards, not doors

1 don’t understand people in Grirmcll. i am‘

out getting my Green-light Red—light on on
Saturday night and for some rcnson some n-hole
decides iris a good idea to deface my door. Here
i am trying to enjoy mylifc at Grinncll,running
for senator, auditioning for plays, and searching
for green, and some spineless ,twit decides my
door looks like it good drawing board.Thanlt you
for the on, but it was not nppmciarcd. All I’m
going to say to whoever defaced my door is that
you are lucky i didn't catch you, because that:
would have been NO LIMITS to the treatment
you would have received.

A, like, grammatical concern

1 know we ate all young nnd it is part of out
vernacular, but scriously, using ‘like‘ every third
word is annoying

 

 

 

Ethnocentrism aside, much love

Dear Editorial Board ofVVriLcr’s Diycss,

For the sake of consistency, I dccidcd to
communicate my thoughts on your latest issue
through the 5&3 instead of with you directly.
And before you ﬁre up your word processors,
hear me out.

lim and Minshall, this isn't a “random Hint
at all but a “warranted rave!” I ronliy liktd your
latest issue and l thought it was legitimately hiv
larious. The section “Laughter Sine Beats Social
Injustice" had no: checking my own white privi-
legs, challenging tmnsphobia, and considering
the ADA-accessibility or my fnvozize locales! It
was a really smart issue. Thanks for putting it
togetherr Just one thing, {or it less etlmoccmxic
lone, consider printing the next issue in a lan-
gimge orncr than English, Also, bl' * c.

In conclusion, Laughter: 1. Polio: 0.
