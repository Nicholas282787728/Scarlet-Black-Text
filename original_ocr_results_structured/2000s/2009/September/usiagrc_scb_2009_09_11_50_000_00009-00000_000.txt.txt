1.11.111. squirrels go?

BY KAMILA BERKALIEVA AND NAINA CHHinEit
While strolling down Park Street, numerous people
have been viciously assailed by rapidly r1lling, near 1etl11l
acorns. Most look up expecting to 1 see 1 rabid squirrel
with blood shot eyes malevolently guffawing at them
Yet mysteriously, all they see are mere gobs of leaves.
innocently swaying iii the crisp, nippy brccze.
Where the f""k are the squirrels that once held
_ such 1 prominent and eiitcrtainingiifmildly
(htcﬂienlngipl‘esence on our campus?
Naturally, we were compelled to suce
cumb to out curiosity and conduct an
experiment On a typical summer's
day, while sitting on a bench in the
Forum, we counted the number of
squirrels that we saw. During that time
period or 15 minutes, only five squirrels
passed by.
Being first years, we weren’t sure if
this low number was typical of Grinacll,
so we asked some passersby for their opine
ion. Blva Rajbhandari ’12 said that she has barely seen
any squirrels this year and Erica Tharp ’13 agreed.
“When I visited as a prospie last October, there were
definitely more squirrels than rhis year," Tharp said.
Squirrel affection is almost always assumed
among Grinnell students squirrels make me happy," said
Wes i5h1pps '12. This close student squillcl relationship

has caused many to wonder how and why the population

has decreased. Perhaps this bizarre phenomenon is due to

the decrease in quality of dining hall food. Maybe

the squirrels have been chased from their turf by

the new surplus ofrabbirs on campus. or

maybe they simply decided to transfer.

Addy Najcra '10 presents a com-

pellmg alternanve hypothesis. She

stayed on campus over the sum-

met, and was thus a witness to

the crucial tinnsition from an on

of squirrels to a darker age of

squirrel extinction. "In recent

months, the squirrel has be-

come easily stunned and inco-

herent as 1 wave a hello, which

doubles as a warning," Najcra

said. “Walking through campus 1

havc found the squirrel signiﬁcantly

more erratic 111 its movements displaying

fear and unpredictable Zigzag ging, possibly 1.1 correla-

tion with the rrsc in rural Mrdwcstern inctliainplictiminc
labs."

Our investigation of rhe squtttcl dcclrnc ultimately
proved inconclusive, but luckily the squirrels have since
slowly started to increase their campus prescl‘lceilfskinr
met and more volatile than ever before. New question:
WTF is up with the rise in Iowa rncth labs?

A tasty new feature chronicling creative dining hall endeavors, disasters

BYJUMI BELLo

Despite the recent awards claiming that Grinncll dining
cooks and presents the most kickeass college food 111 Amer»
ica, Grinnellians still secretly sulk over a most distasteful
truth: aside from experimental frenzies like MakerarCLuev
adilla night and the increasingly daring pizza station (BLT
or hamburger pickle pizza anyone?), college dining is often
boring, not to mention repetitive.

Rather than depending on homeecooked care packages
from Mom and Pop to spice up their taste buds, many Grins
nellians take matters into their own mouths by creating their
own concoctions. Such ingenuity leaves its small traces in
the dining hall—chocolate cake frosting in the microwave,
coffee spills near the frozen yogurt. But many students have
been especially puzzled by the bits of salsa, vegan granola
and ﬂax seeds scattered across the wafﬂe station.The perpe-
trator and mysterious culinaiy vigilante has since been iden-
tified and is none othei than Joe Hiller'lZ.

“It’s about mixing from different stations that's impor-
tant," Hiller said. Afrer a couple otweeks of typical dining
hall food, I-lillcr got bored and missed his own home cook-
ing. According to Hiller, the waffle iron is one of the few
appliances that actually cooks for you and so 11c was drawn
to it, experimenting with flavor combinations that people
weren't used to, essentially beginning his current affair with
food art.

Hillcr has become marginally famous for his waffle ex-
periments, which leave rhe wattle statron a mess of alien
ingredients. One of 111s past masterpieces is the infamous
rosemary basil waffle bathed 111 marinara sauce and topped
wrth sauteed red peppers and mozzarella cheese from the
salad station.

one of Hillcr’s favorite personal concoctions acrnally
doesn't require a wafﬂe iron. He calls it "icy Mexican hot
cliocolatc"aiid to create it all you do is “take some chocolate
ice cream, mix it with soy milk, so it can become nice and
icy. Add some cayenne pepper to it, so it then becomes cma
nainon,"Hillcr said,“lt becomes kind oflikc a Me. an hot
chocolate. except it's ice, so it's refreshing. People are often
sometimes off put by ititltc chocolate and chili combina-

Joe’s Flaxen Granola Waffle

1. Take a little bit more than a scoop of
the waffle batter.

2. Sprinkle in some cinnamon, flaxen
seed, oatmeal, wheat germ and vegan
granola crunch.

3. Since the mix is crunchy, spray the pan
to avoid the batter sticking to the pan.
4. For the lovely frosting, take some
cream cheese, put it in a little cup and
put it in the microwave to melt it and
mix it with some maple syrup.

5. Arrange some artfully placed bluebere
ries on the top if you, like Joe, dig a fruity
finish.
