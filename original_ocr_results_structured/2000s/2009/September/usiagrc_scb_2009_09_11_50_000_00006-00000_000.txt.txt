Drake Library

The Stewart Library in town will be closed due to mov-
ing from Oct. 5 to Nov. 1, and will reopen as the Drake
Community Library at 5th Avenue and Park Street on No,
vembcr 2. “The Stewart Library is 108 years old. We’ve outr
grown [his location," Marilyn Kciinctt, an assistant librarian,
said.

The overall goal for the new library is to be more
conducive to common spaces. Whereas in the old librari,
customers would come by, pick up their books and leave the
new library will have study spaces, meeting spaces, a “"teen
arca, computers and comfortable seating.

Technology will irnproveeriiere will be 16 computers in
the new libri°iry, as compared to only four in the old one,
Wil i reception throughout the entire building and a TV.

The book collections will have more space, easier access
and room for growth,” Kennett said. The kids' section, or
the “Story Room” space, will be much cozier. According to
Kennett, there will be a “treescape” in the room for kids to
imagine they are in a forest,

The grand opening week will be from December
5-11. “This will include special events, such as the dedica-
rion ofthe new library," Kennett said. She encourages people
ofall ages to come and check it out.

Phase II Athletic Complex

The upcoming opening ofPhase II ofthe Athletic Come
plex will provide a state- --of the- art space for varsity athletes,

students and community members. “There will be a 50-inc—
tcr pool, dlvrded into two bulkheads, with three separate
activity areas," President for Institutional Planning Marci
Sortor said Becausc of the size ofthc aquatics facility, div-1
ing practice, water polo, and community exercise could all
potentially be happening at the same time in the pool There
will also be awhrilpool, as well as a teaching iooin for swim
[cams to have discussion.

Also in tlic natatorium will he a new climbing wall, a
bouldering wall and a viewing space below and above these
walls- for those who get thei lirnbing rlirills vicariously

In addition to the aquatic center, thcrc will he a I‘nultk
purpose dance room, larger than the Roberts Tlicati'c, so
that people can practice dance routines including those ins
volvrng “leaping off the stage," Sortor said. “This room will
have a sprung wood floor, with a liiatlcy-typc surface,” she
saidThis special performance floor is like a springboard, so
it gives less resistance to people dancing on it,

The Field House will havc “hainniertoss, golf, bascball,
tiaek, long jump, pole vault and tennis," Sortor said. "There
will be PE faculty offices, classrooms, training rooms, locker
rooms and equipment issue. There will also be a big classr
room on the third floor, which can be separated into two
classrooms.

The new building will bc connected to the Darby Gyms
nasiiirn via an underground tunnel, which will have locker
rooms for swim teams, community members, faculty, and
coaches.

Not only are the features chitingAso are rhe environ-
mental initiatives heing taken There will be air- handling

equipment that recapture: and reuse: hcat. Sortor noted the
inclusion ofa “geothermal well for the pool area itself." As
for the Field House, there will he “a rain water catchment
system that picks up the water that runs offthe roof and the
condensed water from airrliandling cquipineiit.1t then uses
this water to water fields and flush toilets in the Field House
area," Sorter said.

The new Athletic Facilities building is due to be ﬁnished
in August 2010. sorter explained that while they would like
to demolish the Physical Education Complex (FEC) at the
same time the new building is finished, they will probably
have to wait until after 2010, as demolishing it could llllL‘l”
rapt classes that still use it. Either way, amazing facilities
will be available to us next )eat.

Bike path points south to Walmart

New pathway will provide safe route for cyclists and pedestrians along busy Highway 146 starting in November

BY TYLER BANAS

Walmart is an enterprise designed to
provide a convenient shopping experience,
But when the store itseifis located far out
sidc of a town’s central hub, the journey
there may not be so convenient, To the ac-
eord of many Grinnellians, help is under
construction.

A bike path, averaging 10 feet in width
and running a total of .86 miles along
Highway 146 is currently being paved. Tire
project began mieriily and is expected to
be complete in no working days. Given an
estimated three to four workdays per week,

the path should be ready for use around
early November. It will extend from the
already existing parh surrounding Arbor
Lake and head south to Industrial Avenue.
This will allow community members an alt
tcrnativc method of traveling to Walmart,
Thciscn’s and other notable locations.

As the primary north-south thorough—
fare in town, Highway 146 is a hazardous
place for cyclists. Martin StuhtsRommcr—c»
im, a local high school student who knows
the area well, has never attempted riding
his bicycle to VValmai't. “You have to ride
alongside the road," he said. “It's kind of

SC ool boa d elected .

risky." One or the largest employers in the
areaicrmliell Mutual Reinsurance Cori
is located south of LSD, resulting in waves
ofcommuters heading to and from work.
“We’ve wanted a trail through town
from north to south for some time now.
The funding has made it possible," Jan
Anderson, a working associate of the City
Manager, said. The new bicycle path is be
ing funded by several agencies, including
the City of Grinnell, Walmart, Grinnell
Tourism Group and lmagine Grinnell, a
nonproﬁt dedicated to improving quality of
life in the greater Grinnell area This fund

ing is stirring up propositions to add adv
dirional segments to the path in the future.
It may eventually extend as far south as the
Interstate or connect to the trail heading
west to Rock Creek State Park.

According to Melissa Strovcrs, EXCCL"
tivc Director ofImagine Grinnell, the idea
for the bike path has been under consid
eration for some time now, and the com»
munity is readily anticipating the upcoming
convenience.

On Tuesday Sept, 8, Grinnell held the Grinnell-Newburg Coni—
munity school board election. The polls were open from 7 am.
until 8 pm. There were five local poll stations. The candidates
were Barbara Brown, Leo Lease and Eric Pederson for Director’s
post, Kevin Kolbe ran againstleffrey D. Smith for Director District
1 while for Director District 2, the only candidate was Douglas
F. Cameron.

Donna _German, Chairperson of Ward 4, said she was im-

pressed with the election crowd ihis time as it was much big- '

get than they had anticipated. ”The School Board Elections are
usually pretty Slow but this time it’s been good,” German said.
"There is competition this time so people felt they wanted to be
heard. Earlier it would just be one candidate so one was inter-
ested in voting really.”

Sheila Latcham, Chairperson of Ward 5 felt the same way. ”A
few decisions made earlier this year were not approved by many
so that is brining many people out this time,” she said.

The winners will be announced on the Grinnell-
Newburg Community School District Web site:
