SGA executive elections Spark flurry of campaigning

Student candidates covered campus in posters while soliciting voter support doorstordoor during heated election

EV]. FRANCIS Busts

Only a week after the political madness
began, SGA executive elections areifor the
most partialready over. While the results of
the run-off between Vice President Student
ofAffairs (VPSA) candidates Ben Offenberg
’11 and Nut Peit1'10 will not be announced
until midnight on Saturday, the planning,
campaigning, and voting have all ceased, leav-
ing campus a little bit quieter.

Shortly after discovering at midnight
Tuesday, March 3 that he would be involved
in a runoff against Pcitz, Offenbelg printed
offncw posters and made a fourehour journey
across campus to advertise the second round,

Offenberg, however, said he was prepared
for the close first round~only nine votes sepa
rated him and Peitz—and thus the runeoff. “I
fully expected a close race, and 1 fully expected
there to be a run-off,”0ffenberg said,

Peitz also said she was ready for a narrow
margin. similar to Offenbetg, Peitz had pos-
tered well past midnight for the election. "For
runeoffs 1 already had posters printed out, be-
cause I was kind of expecting it,” she said. “I
have neVer not been in a runoff."

But while a heated VPSA race pushed Ofe
fenherg and Peitz to continue their campaign
ing, other candidates had opposite reactions to
their respective contests. Vice President ofAcr
adelnic Aﬂ‘aits (VPAA) candidate Jacob RClST
berg’lo withdrew from his run-otfagainst ris
val VPAA candidate Joanna DeMars ‘10 in the
afternoon Thursday during voting. Trailing 43
percent to 28 percentin the general election to
Demars, Reisberg said that he decided to “bow
out graciously" and remove much of the stress
from the election.

“I felt like there was no point in making
the voters speak again," Rersberg said. “Also,
there was no point in making Joanna have to
be nervous for another two days."

Another candidate's withdrawal was not
initially as clear-cut as Reisberg’s. Most stu-
dents did not foresee Presidential candidate
John Burrows' '10 premature departure from
the presidential race less than six hours prior
to the election Monday night, and were left
with little explanation.

Burrows, who is currently the SGA VPSA,
said that he dropped out of the race due to a
“conﬂuence offactors." He stressed the ime
portance of remaining in touch with students’

mats and needs as a cabinet executive, and
said the nature of the position grew isolating
with time in a way that would inhibit his pro-
ductivity as an SGA President.

“People have lost trust in me, and I have a
much bigger problem with that than the po-
sition," Burrows said. “To remain an effective
advocate while still m ntluning those friend~
ships and relationships and the actual Lived
experiences that matter, that's why I decide to
drop out, because I’m still going to pursue and
he an advocate while not necessarily being part
orthc systemt"

In the two-person race that resulted from
Burrows’ withdrawal, Presidential candidate
Harry Krejsa ’10 handily won the election over
Fernando Jenkins '10,efrectivelylaying the first
seeds for the formation ofnext year’s SGA.

Even though the VPSA race is still rin-
resolved, Krejsa has already begun to roughly
mold the shape ofthe SGA Cabinet and Joint
Board, with a postrclcction rhetoric heavily
reliant on what Krejsa said is a “fundamental
reimagming of what the senator position is."
Krejsa said he has begun talks with current As
sistant Treasurer and future Treasurer Cyrus
Witthaus and Demars, and scheduled a meets
ing with College President Russell Kt Osgood
for today in hopes of getting a head start on
the duties of next fall.

Krejsa said he hopes to have his new son
Cabinet ratiﬁed as soon as possible after spring
break so that they can begin shadowing the
current cabinet “immediately."

"Each of us will follow around our predee
cessor as much time as our schedules can pert
mit," Krejsa said. “Most importantly, we want
to see them on a daily basis. I want my cabi-
net to know [their roles] now so that as soon
as we get back on campus we can settle right
back into thatjoli.”

The candidates who lost their bids said
they have varying plans. Mona Ghadiri ’11,
who ran for VPSAr said the race only stoked
her desire to continue in SGAt Reisberg said
he plans to continue in Judco but will likely
abstain from seeking an SGA position.

With the elections past, the candidates
tended to agree on one thing—they are glad
it's over. “I’m horribly behind on homework,”
Ghadiri said. “I’m glad to be done with it.”
