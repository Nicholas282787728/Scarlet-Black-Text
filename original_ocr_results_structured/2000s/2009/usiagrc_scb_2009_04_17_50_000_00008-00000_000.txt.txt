A warning: transforming into a drag queen might cause
psychological changes and real-world fashion side effects.
Dancing on stage decked out in stiletto boots, flowing locks
and full makeup, you'd never guess that Brock Webb ’09 has
spent the previous week wearing nothing but sweatpants.

“You put on the hose and tights and the skinrtight dress
and the tight coat and my personal fashion just like goes
down," Webb said,“1t's like, okay, a shirt and sweatpants. A
lot of cigarettes. Usually a bath"

Fashion woes or not, this two-time QPOC drag show
veteran will once again be gracing the stage this Fliday night
at 10 p.in.,perfotming for your donations to the AIDS Ptoir
ect of Central Iowa.

In previous diag show performances, Webb has done
routines to “Kiss Off" by the scissor Sisters and “Believe"
by Cher.

“The first time was very much like ‘Oh, well, I'll do this,'
and I was terrified and just kind of threw everything toe
gether last minute and didn’t have choreography whatsoever
but I still did it and itwas fun,"Webb said. “The second time
with Cher itjust kind of got so built up in my head before
hand that by the end I was just like okay, it has to be great."

As this drag show is his last,Webb will go big by return-
ing to his roots and performing “Ooh," another scissor Sis-
ters track. Unlike the first rendition, though,Webb planned
this one far in advance. “I actually started my costume |n
January and I’ve been working on it off and on since then
so this is going to be the big one," he said. “I’ve also learned
how to do real drag queen makeup,"

Drag queen makeup is a complicated and detailed art.
“[It's] about seven layers of foundation in about four differ»
ent colors and you add it in all sorts of contours on the face
like highlights underneath your eyes and on the top of your
cheekbones going up and then shadows underneath your .
checkbones and on your forehead to kind of give it a more r/ww m Harv
feminine shape," Webb said. ”It takes a long time."

The makeup will supplement Webb's costume, which has
been under construction for quite some time, Though he
made his ﬁrst two drag costumes from scratch, using pure
chased fabric, his costume for this year is an amalgamation
of his own clothing and some Goodwill purchases, with his
own creative touch.

“I have a coat that's actually my coat. a men’s coat, just
this really big gray rectangular blob and I cut it into different
pieces and re-sewed it together so it’s a much more feminine
shape, like it's much more curvy now and it's got princess
seams in the front and the brick,” Webb said. “So now I'm
just going to like sew sequins on all over it and pair it with a
stretchy dress that I found at Goodwill.”

And the shoes. You can’t forget the shoes. Webb must
prepare himself for the four-and-a-half inch stiletto boots
that he plans to sport tonight.

“When I first got them I walked around my house, I also
walked from my house [at 8th and Main] to Lonnski's and
that was a bad ide:;1was so dead afterwards.”

Webb, who tops out at 6’4", admits that trekking down-
town in fourrnndtnrhnlftmch stilettos did attract some at-
tentron,

“Walking by Pizza Hut there was like these two old,
pickup-truck-dtiving men with like plaid shirts and (111:de
look at me and keep talking and theny'ust like look again and
look at me for a while," Webb said. “It was funny."

Though Webb may stand out in broad daylight in rural -

Iowa, he encounters a totally different environment back-
stage at the drag show, where crossedtessing is just another
part of the night.

"Once we're backstage together everybody is kind of just
like running around and screaming at each other like ‘Oh my
god I love your wig I love your shoes 1 love your outfit, oh , _ ,g ,7
my god can I borrow that for mine?’"W€bb Sild- “W236 very Smab Blot/t 70, Brett Webb '09, and/Mia Mcl'J/cl' '09 prepare ﬁn [/1217 priﬁaimame t7f“Oﬂ/l, "by the Scum Siifirx, at edit wtel'mdk
