You were in the Foreign service for 25
years. Speciﬁcally, what part of your experi-
ence included intelligence work?

The first fe tours I had were involved
with political/m tary issues and it was only
after I served in Moscow and returned to the
U.S in 1990 that I took a position in the in-
telligence bureau of the State Department,
known as the Bureau of Intelligence and

Research (INR). It was the logical thing to
do, coming out of the Soviet Union, because
I l\‘tl(‘l been working on nuclear arms control
issues there and pulltlcalﬂnlllﬁuy fears in
general, and thcjoh I took in INans a divi-
sion chief responsible for monitoring Soviet
stiategic forces at the time and the strategic
forces of other countries
I worked in that position for
three years and found that I at-
tually 1i d working as an illicl~
llgeilce analyst because much of
my previous career I had been
reporting on what was happen—
ing in other countries bur also
serving some U.S policies that
I was not particularly excited
about. 1 was a Foreign Service
Ofﬁcer having to justify the
Reagan administration. Then, in the area of
arms control, I wasn’t in agreement with the
very policies that I was trying to represent to
other countries. I liked the Intelligence Bur
reau because it was an opportunity to feel sat-
isfied at the end of the day, ifl had at least
captured the reality as objectively as I could.
After this three—year tour, I worked on the
German desk, and rhen ended up going back
to Brazil, but then came back to the Intelr
ligcnce Bureau and served then a four-year

MARFA PROKIIDRDVA

toui.Towaid the end ofnly career, I had a toe
tnl orscven years in the Intelligencc Bureau.

In a July 2003 issue of The Guardian,
you said, “I believe the Bush administra-
tion did not provide an accurate picture to
the American people of the military threat

posed by Iraq.“

. That's a good summary

, of the bottom line of a lot the

things I tried to talk about in the

summer of 2003, and I would

have to say I tried to talk about

_ it a lirrle bit before rhen, but my

efforts to draft OprEd pieces

for the Mrbitlgmi Putz were
turned down before the war.

It was only after the war
when I was able to say, “You know, I wrote
this piece then," and I was quoted in the New
York Timer and got all kinds of press atten—
tion.

In your speech, you discussed the m:-
cessity for Congress to receive the proper
amount of intelligence from the executive
branch.

I was making the point that it is the law

that the executive branch has to share with
the Congress all intelligence in a rimely man-
ncr on k y intelligence activities in the U.S.
It is Congress, after all, that authorize and
appropriates the money for those activities,
and our Constitution creates CCl‘lmn responr
sibilities to the legislative branch] think that
the Congress has not been as assertive as it
should be in demanding that the executive
branch give it what it has a right to see.

And the Congress, for its part, has done
a lot to severely limit the number of mem-
bers who see the intelligence on a daily ba
sis, [Congress] has a limited staff that is fully
cleared to get all the intelligence, and it has
very strict rules on what those members and
the staff can do to make sure that the secrets
remain secretst So, Congress is doing its part
of the bargain, but the administration is not
doing its part ofthe bargain.

I’m talking about the last administration,
but I warned in my speech that we have to
be vigilant about the new administration be-
cause the intelligence Committee is not go
ing to want to share the information that it
should be sharing with the Congress.

What can we learn from Vietnam and
Iraq, in ivhich decisions were made before
proper evidence was shown?

I look at both of the episodes that I meﬂ’
tiolied,Toiikin Gulfiii the Vietnam War and
the Iraqi War decision, and I rhinlt in both
cases, a few days or a couple of weeks would
have allowed the correct infoimation to per-
colatc upt

Certainly, in the case of Tonkin Gulf,
then: were already indications coming in that
we thought there had been two attacks on our
ship in international watels. And, it turned
out that there was only one attack, We had
been misinterpreting some of the Communi’
cations that they were referring to the first
attack and we thought they were referring to
another attack. That stuff would have sorted
itselfout fairly quickly ifwe kept our sword in
the sheath for a while.

similarly, in Iraq, the U.N. inspectors were
making good progress at satisfying them-
selves about the nonrexistence ofcertain pm,
grams. They were figuring out that some of
those ambiguities had been identified earlier,
We were actually destroying Saddam’s shottr
range missilest so, anotllet few weeks may
have satisfied us that Saddam was still in the
box.

But, we were so impatient to go to war
that we didn’t give it a few weeks.The French
asked for a few weeks. The UN. asked for a
few weeks. But we would not give them a few
weeks. And, it’s a great pity in light ofall the
strings that were coming unwound in the ad—
ministration'sjustification.
