Spend money to help the current students

Amongst the unccasing print and media
analysis orBarack Obmnn's inaugural speech, a
consensus, ifmlly a single one, has emerged: as
the President iteinted,we ate in a crisis, and we
citizens, collectively, tire in prirt responsible.

Obnma’s didactic undertone wasn’t always
so subtle. “Our economy is badly weakened, a
consequence of greed and irresponsibility on
the putt of some, but also our collective {All’
tire, he said that morning. Our mtions mcr
din hits relegated much eliticlsm to big bunks,
unrcgulntcti mllrkets und greedy executives.
But higher education, im area that purportedly
consists of ntcrc goodrnatured professors and
administrators dressed in inconspicuous Hort
ris Tweed, has curiously escaped rhc present
deluge of condemnation,

1n the past decade, a period marked by
crude sybarirism, Grinnell has been no excep-
tion. Contrary to our school's professed mis-
sion of producing people that can “evaluate
critically both their own and otllers’ ideas," the
college has succumbed to the peivnsive, orgi-
nstic indulgence of the time. The administra-
tion certainly did not adhere to this mission,
but instead chose to cough up millions upon
millions on at least nine new buildings. As
we all know, the Rosenficld Center is littered
with completely unnecessary goodies, like the
ﬂat screen televisions that line the walls, or the
dozens ofhnrdly used rooms. All the while ﬂd’
ministrarors took home six ﬁgure salaries, and
our president remains among the highest pnid
iii the nation. Sound familiar?

And like all of the other largerscdle fl’
niinciitl institutions we keep hearing about,
Grinncll hits fllccd the some repercussions. I
remember the opening ceremony for the new
student center, in which trustees swnggcrcd
around the building in their glitzy formal wear,

Unnecessary hating on campus

It came as an unpleasant surprise to us
when wc picked up ottr copy of“Writer's Dir
grcss" and noticed that nearly every page was
filled with oppressive and deeply oftensivc
langungc about women, “mentally challengcd
people," and those diagnosed with “n AIDS, "
we value the work ofSPARC and their efforts
to support through funding a wide range or
itttcrcslrbﬂscd student publications. However,
we rlunk that SPARC should engage in critic
cal analysis and open dintoguc with the writers
and editors of the publications they fund.

Thur occasion, one that simultaneously reeked
ofglamour and prufligucy. couldn't be any more
different from where we are nowithc Grille,
sitting right in the middle ofthut ovcrrthertop
building, recently shortcllcd its hours to save
money, Tire dining hall was obligated to make
a similar sacriﬁce, now providing meals with
one fewer station than previously.

We wcre all distressed to hear about the
massive drop in our colleges endowment, and
all indications suggest that this will only wors-
en; some predict that

for? Instead of stptnndcnng our resources on
voluptuous cosmetics, we could have invested
in more scholarships for domestic underrcpr
resented minority students or veterans and
other students from military fhntilicsijust
two of the y groups flagrantly tucking in

curcommu. ry,
in a rcccnr conversation with an alum, I
was asked about how students feel about the
school. "1 love Grinnell,"l told him, candidly.
But then 1 went on to explrlin an unequivocal
truth: there is a palpable senti-

 

this so called “safety

years, What’s worse

last several years, has focused
more and more on buildings, the

is that, as families
face a worse cconcrny, applications to liberul
arts schools like Grinnell will only drop, which
will in turn exacerbate our budget crunch Tire
Ncw vino TIME: recently ran an article proﬁling
top srudcncs who are having to defer attendr
tng their own state universities because their
families could no longer afford the mition. If
this is the case with state schools, just imagine
Grinncll, which not only comes with :t bloated
sticker price but also offers virtually no practi-
cal skills or name recognition.

ironically, I’m not even sure ifspcnding less
would have been beneﬁcial. In fact, the college
should have probably spent a whole lot more.
The money's all gone now anyway, and it
would have made sense to spend it rather than
let it sit indeﬁnitely and ultimately evaporate,
a point that Donald Frey and Lynne Munson
posed in a Bari‘mi Globe article last month. But
it is pnrnmount to splurge responsibly; cnn you
fathom how many endowed chairs a less 05*
tentutious campus center could have provtded

We \veie especially disappointed that it no
point was the opprc re and offensive nurnrc
of celtiun SubmlSS ns ilcknowlcdged or Cl'llll’
longed by the editor ofwvrtr 's Dtgrcss" or
the booklet’s finitncml muscle. It is neither itp’
ptopriutc nor iesponsiblc to distribute blatantly
nusogvntstic, clussist, und itblcist mitteriiil with
a complete disregard for the rumi mono or
proliferating language of this ntttute

While we could cite the many unfortunate
chmces made by certnin contributors, there is
Simply not enough space in this column

We reject the notion that one must be of
felisive to be funny. The BFJS, as well as nus

iitgly nebulous notion of“instir
tutional longevity,” constantly promulgated by
the trustees All ofthis has taken place at the
expense of student interests, studentrfacult‘y
interaction and academicsithe most fundar
mental things that comprise any college or
university. And though no one has conveyed
this widcly held sentiment overtly, it's there.
we all feel it, we rill know about it. The furtive
dismissal urn popular Student Affairs member
has only intensified the feeling otdernchmcnt
between students and administrators.

Alum, fourth-year, whatever the hell I am,
I’ll be our ofhere come May. But i have loved
this place, and the fact that I chose to come
back reﬂects my affinity for the school. I can
only hope that once I’m in the “real world,"
the administration will realize that investing
in our students is the surest way to maintain
“institutional longevity.” I hope that we can
“dust ourselves off,"as President Obumu asked,
and stiu‘t running Grinnell like a college, not a
corporation.

tiontlly syndicated publications such as Tor
0min, successfully critique popular culture
and the human experience without nlicnae
ing or further margilidlizing member-s ofottr
society.

While there is no \v.ly to rake back saying
thtlt men should “fuck every hole rind oriﬁce
that they can"or encouraging t-cadcrs to refrain
from "pnwn[ing] off your smack child on the
mentally hmldicnpped,"\ve hope that “Writer's
Digrcss" will, in rhc future, seriously rethink
many otrhe editorial decisions they made in
their first edition.
