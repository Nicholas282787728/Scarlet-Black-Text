FEBRUARY 15, 1974 — Quad dining hall was the
scene’of the “party to end all parties”—~almost in a literal

To Burling computer users

Its not enjoyable to walk across campus to
Btirling,knuwing that I need to type up an essay.
Its less enjoyable to learn that by the time] get
there, all the computers ate rikcn.

there before me; that's ﬁne. But pleasc~plcaSC~
use them (or academic reasons] despise seeing
somebody gossiping uancebonlt chat on one of
those ohAso-ﬁnite Hurling computers, or watch-
ing an assuredly funny YouTnbe clip. Go to s
computer lab for that» and ism librnry comput-
61:5 {or those that are actually going to study.

Could you please dispose of the corpsicle _
squirrels by Younker?
‘ ' They’re gross.
