Language as art:
one vowel at a time

“Awkward grammar appalls 1 craftsman. A Dada bard
as daft 1s Tznra damns stagnant art and scrawls an alph1 (1
slapdash arc 111d 1 backward leg) that mars all stanzas and
jams 111 ballads (what 1 scandal). A madcap v1nd11 etarts a
small black nnkhia hand stamp that can stamp 1 wax pad
and at last plant a ark th1t sparks an 1111 reign/i.

Notice anything odd about the first para
re1ding ir aloud Hear anything strange about 1t.> Does it
seem A little lacking>

Because it is. Lacking every vowel except A, that is.
There are no E’s, 1’s, 0’: or US in it, just as there are no
EH5 Is 0‘ s or Us in the chapter that it' s excerpted from:
Chapter A from Emmm, 11 book written by Canadian poet
Christian Bok This weeks column is devoted to a dirk!”
ent kind of 1r. than columns pastithc manipul ation of
language.

Emwl'n is a five-chapter series of univocnlic lipograms,
A lipogram is 1 form ofconstrained writing or a wold game
which excludes certain lerters or a g1oup of letters from a
piece. A univocalic lipogram 1s a lipogram that excludes all
but one selected vowel1

Each of Eulmm's chapters uses just one vowcl: A in the
ﬁrst, E in the second, and so on. The name of the book
comes from the Greek word which can mean “well mind,"
“beautiful thinking," “to carryfavor,"o1-“ingratiate oneself
with.”

 

I probably don’t need to stress how difﬁcult omitting
vowels from sentences can be... After reading the first
chapter of Emmi/1, a friend and I tried to hold conversa-
tions without using E, I, O or U this summer. Needless to
say, it was pretty much impossible. I mean, how do you let
someone know that you need to go to the bathroom using
only A's?

omitting vowels in writing might be slightly easier. But
it’s cert1inly no walk in the park. As Bok rather aptly puts
it in the opening lines of his “1” Chapter: “[w]riting is in-
hibiting, Sighing, I sit, scriblling in ink this pidgin script.
I sing with nihilistic witticism disciplining signs with tri~
ﬂing gimmicks1.."

Iwas drawn to Bok’s Emmi/I because of the way it made
me so aware of the letters that I use. It's one thing to be
conscious ofword choice, but keeping track of letters is a

. completely different thing, totally changing how you think
about language.

In terms of content, Eutwiu reads like a long, bizarre-
sounding proscepoem, Each chapter m1kes sense .They
tell coherent stories from different perspectives in different
settings.

But there is something distinctly “different" about its
rhythm. Listening to passages read aloud,you can intuit this
without being able to pinpoint exactly what the difference
might be. To quote the French reviewer Michel Basilieres,
“Bok’s constant repetition of 1 single vowel, while at the
same time employing the widest possible vocabulary, re
sults in a kind or aural echoing that sets rhythms and pate
terns moving of their own momentum.

After reading a few pages of Eunol‘iz, the smallest part
ofa book, 1 column, or even The First college Newspaper
West ofthe Mississippi takes on new signiﬁcance.

It's completely overwhelming and, at least for me, tee
news my respect for the way we communicate with one
anothet in writing. The rhythm ofwriting comes alive us
ing lipogr1ms and other kinds orwotd games. Using them
and testing the limirs of your vocabulary re1lly does make
you more sensitive to the words you write and the way you
speak.

Recognizing written language and looking at it in 1
different way can elevate it in your mind. Writing is also
an art form, from crafting plotlincs down [0 the placement
of each individual lctret. Christian Bok’s Emmz/I does an
excellentjob of reminding us ofthis fact.

in conclusion (sorry guys, this was the best 1 could do):
Go forth, opt for words from crosswords, ports, cooks or
books. Play as (wins at Accr1, aptly, ably and smartly 1
think frigid m1dn1ght smiling. U sculpt fun 4 urself w/
“wurds”.

Jazz legend Wynton Marsalis to perform

Marsalis and his Jazz at Lincoln Center ensemble set for Wednesday concert

BY CLAiRE REEDER
one of the nation's most acclaimed jazz musicians will

come to town on Wednesday, when Herrick Chapel hosts _

trumpeter Wynton Marsalis for an 8 p. m. performance.

Marsalis staggering list of accomplishments shows why
he comm1nds so much respect The nine time Grammy
winner has also won the Pulitzer Prize for Music for his
musical depiction ofslavery titled Brook 121,111 [1111» Under—
ground and helped direct and produce jazz, 1 documentary
by noted director Ken Burns. Marsalis currently directs the
Jazz at Lincoln center ensemble,

a prestigious group with whom he
will play at Wednesday's concert

According to Professor of 117.1.
studies Damani Phillips, Music,
IVIarsalis’s notoriety derives from
his wide-ranging repertoire and
his promotion of the neorclassical
style, which fuses rock with principles of previous periods
of jazz. Marsalis and his orchestra comprise the premier
ensemble in the country and play music from all periods
of jazz.

“They are very studied and accurate in recreating the
old style of music from the 1920s and 305,” Phillips said.
“it's something you won't hear anywhere clse1"Thc group is
also known for explaining the history along the way to help
the audi cc understand what is being played.

That Marsalis and the ensetnble are coming is itself a
lucky and unexpected opportunity. The concert arose outr
side of the Committee for Public Events’ planned and paid
for ﬁne arts performance season.

Herrick Chapel

Conference Operations Rachel Bly '93 stumbled upon 1
chance for Marsalis to make a stop on campus as part ofa
previously scheduled Midwest tout.

Bly‘s good rapport with Marsalis’agent brought the inir
tial agreement. Ely then made a proposal for extra funding
for this oneetime opportunity to President Russell K. 011
good, who ofﬁcially approved the performance.

“Grinnell has good connections and history orconcetts
being brought to campus, and we are able to get some really
exciting people through these relationships. Artists come

ment on how they like to play in
such to intimate and great venue,"
said Bly. “It's really serendipitous
the way it occurred."

Students and community mem-
bers can look forward to a gem
ofa concert, and as both Phillips
and Bly emphasized, 1 chance to
hear one of the best jazz bands in the world live. Tommy
johnson '09, a member of Grinnell's Jazz Ensemble, echoed
these feelings of anticipation.

“In small town lowa it's amazing that We can get some~
one like Mr. Marsalis to come playfdohnson said. “The
Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra is one of the best bands
1to11nd today, and there 1rcn't many left because the econoe
my is down and the jazz economy is down, so [petformers]
can make more money in smaller trios or quartets."

ovciall, Phillips stiesscd the high e111be1 of the Or—
chestia. “There is such a concentration of stellar mlIsiCianS
in that band," he said “They can literally hand pick who
they want, and that is exactly what they've done, It's an 11111
usual but pleasant surprise that way out here, we have the
rare opportunity to experience this kind ofstnff."
