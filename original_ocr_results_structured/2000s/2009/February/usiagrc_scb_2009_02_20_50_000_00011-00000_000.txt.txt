County College. High
school wasnt the best time
for me,’ Bylone said. Iwas
beaten up almost every day, I was the one
who was picked on because I danced so, my

After a fruitful time at Cumberland,
where he started a Gay-straight Alliance
and participated in Student Government,
Bylone transfeiied to Rutgers Univelslty.
Immediately, Bylone IgIIn became active
in Student Government and the Rutgers'
Gay—Straight Alliance. “1 was president of

45 people over about a two and I half year
time,”

At Rutgers, Bylone maiored in Agricul-

family farms go out of business," Bylone

Attei Rutgers, Bylone attended Eastein

Now as an RLC at Giinnell, Bylone con—
tinues to show concern for student interests.

[have to] sit and listen," he said.

Bylone’s dedication to
students transcends the ow

donna’s song, “Like it oi Not "

“There’s I line in there that says,‘ClcopI-
tra had her way / Mata Hari too / Whether
they were good or bad / ls strictly up to you.’
So, what that’s saying is that 1 am either a
good or bad person but Im not going to
be the Iudgc on whether what I did In my
life Is good or bad. Otth people will he the
judge ofrhar."

As an after Gllnnell, Bylone hopes to
get his doctor-ate. In the long run Bylone
has greater aspirations. “My agenda' is to be
I president on univelslty, Bylone said. It s
not all about me It mav look it, but a lot
of times a leadei needs to put himself out
there.”

Joe Ro‘ancl Warren Buffett bring in the bucks

BVJEFF RADERSTRONG

Joe Rosenfield '25 arrived on campus in 1921 and with-
in two weeks, he fell in love with Grinnell, The Dr: Maine:
Regina, in their 1981 profile of Rosenfield, commented
that “everyone should have such a lover.”

If only everyone could. Rosenﬁeld devoted his life to
Grinnell, bringing the College’s endowment from Iround
811 million in 1968 to over $1 billion by the time of his
death in 2000, With this feat, Rosenﬁcld "made money
grow faster and longer than almost anyone else alive," at
cording to Marley's 2000 profile.

Rosenﬁeld was born in Des Moincs 'In 1904 and made
his first personal investment shortly after the 1929 stock
maIket crash. After graduating from Grinnell he practiced

law for over 20 years before becoming the chairman of
Younkei s depaitment stole, which had recently puichased
his family’s Des Moincs department store. In the 19605,
Is he near-ed Younlter's mandatory retirement age or 65,
Rosentield began to devote more ofhis time to the College.
His only child died in 1962 and after his wife died in 1977,
Grinnell remained Rosenfteld’s one true passion.

In 1967 Rosenfield was intioduced to an investor from
Omaha, the then-unknown Warren Buffett, They met at
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s speech on campus and imr
mediately hit it off. They remained friends for life and Buf~
fett said that “ifafter my dad’s death I could have adopted
Joe as my father, I would have," according to the Monty
profile.

Buffett joined Grinncll’s Board ofTrustees in 1968 and
with Rosenfield, they began to make the unconventional
investments that the College is known for. They bought a
signiﬁcant amount of shares in Buffett’s Berkshire Hatha-
way and purchased a TV station in Dayton,The school put
up 10 percent of the original investment for a new com,
pIny started by another Grinnell IlunI, Robert Noyce ’49.

Noyce's company would eventually became Intel, the
successful computer firm. Because the College had such I

large stake In his company, Noyce became consumed with
fear that he would not only bankrupt himself, but also the
College. Noyce eventually convinced Rosenfleld to sell his
Intel shares in 1980, for $14 million, a proﬁt ofover 4,000
percent. If Rosenfield hId Ignored Noyce and trusted his
instinct to hold out, the original shares would probably be
worth billions of dollars today. Roscnﬁeld has since said
selling the Intel shares was the biggest mistake he ever
made.

Rosenﬂeld’s other returns were not as impressive as
the Intel investment, but still paid offfor the college. The
board sold the Dayton TV station to the Hearst Corporas
tion In 1981 for $49 million, I 281 percent profit. 1n the
early ’905, the College sold its shares in Berkshire Hatha-
way {or 33.7 million.

Rosenfteld died in June 2000 at the age of 96. Despite
his contribution to the College, he had refused to let any
one IIIrne I building after him. President Osgood visited
Roscnﬁcld on his death bed to tell him they were going to
give a building his namesake after he died,

Rosenfield relented, saying it was alright, as long as it
wasn't a gym.
