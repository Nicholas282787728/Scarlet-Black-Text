Resolution between administration and faculty in works

BY PAT CALDWELL

The ongoing dispute between some members of the faculty
and parts of the administration has taken a turn over the past
few days, indicating that a resolution may soon occur.

While an exact decision is still in the works, on Thursd1y,
Feb 19, President Russell K. Osgood rescinded the cease-and-
desist he had previously issued to Ralph savatesc English, on
Jan 26 According to those close to the decisionrnaking, a tentat
tive agreement has also been reached for an external review of
all administrative hirings and frrings.

Osgood would not comment specifrcally on either an extort

rial review or the ceasctandtdesrst, but he did state that, in gen,
e111, ptogiess had been made, and some form oftesolunon may
soon be reached, "I have been talking with Executive Council,
with [the] faculty group 1nd 1 1m very encournged by the dis-
cussions," Osgood said. “We're going to have more discussions
next week all aimed 11 moving [these] matters forward in a con-
structive way."

The change in the dispute appears to have shifted on
Wednesday, when 1 group of faculty met with Osgood. "Vi/e 1s
a group tried to break it down to the big issues that we felt we
could address at this meeting," said Kelly Herold, Russian one

of the professors who 1ttended the meeting.

According the Herald, the faculty at the meeting requested
the external review and the retraction of the letter to Savdtese,
Also discussed were geneml issues about a lack ofindependence
in faculty governance, among other topics.

From this meeting, a tentative external review of the Colt
lege's hiring 1nd firing practices is under development. The re-
view would examine both general College procedures 1s well
as specific p1st inst1nccs, 111d will be open for students, faculty,
and staffto raise concerns.

Gender-neutral housing spreads to more campus residences

BY STEPHANIE NonDsTRoM
& NAJMA OSMAN

Recent moves have brought gender-neu-
trality to the forefront of campus discussion.

The College is pl1nning to expand gender-
neutrnl housing options for the next academic
year, with 123 gender-neutral housing spaces
allotted for next year. Genderrneutral house
ing will be available in Younket North, Loose
Sourh, the Cowles Apnl‘lmelits,and 111 project
houses, which include themed collegerowned
housing such as Eco House.

Gendertnerrtral housing allows students
who opt for it to room with any other stut
dent, legnrdless of gender identiﬁcation, and
ensures access to gender-neutral bathrooms.

“The whole concept of gender neutral hous»
ing at places like Grinnell has been to provide
housing for people for whom the gender bit
nary is not ideal," said Dean of Students Travis
Greene.

According to Erin Duran ’09, who seives
on the Gender Neutral Committee, the move
will be accompanied by incte1sed education
on gender-noutml housing on c1mpus in order
to extend c1mpus aw1rencss. “Gender neut1-1l
housing is for everyone, not just one group,"
Duran said, “It's to make sure that everyone is
comfortable and has options."

According to Grecnc. students may draw

lowed to live in gendertneritral housing.

Greene said that while couples of all sorts
1lrc1dy live together on campus, he advises
against using the new housing option to live

In her campaign pl1tronn last year, SGA

neutrality issues.

happening, there were a lot of students who
were noticing that our college was not very
gender-neutral friendly," Morake said. “We
decided th1t this is something that should be
addressed. [Since] the initiative passed, this
is something that is important to the strident
body."

"We knew there was a demand and a need
for it, so we're trying to figurrc out how we
can move forward without shaking the earth,"
Greene said.

Currently, the 18 gcndctﬂiclltml rooms on
Loose second South represent one percent of
all housing. Next year, gentlef’lieiln'ill housing
will increase to ten percent.
