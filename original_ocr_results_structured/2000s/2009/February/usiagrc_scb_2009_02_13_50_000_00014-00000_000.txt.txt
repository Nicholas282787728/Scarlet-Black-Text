Despite the box score. the players felt that
their play was lacking and could have been here
ter, especially in the ﬁrst half ochloit's game,
where the team was Ice cold from the ﬁeld. "We
didn't play as well as we wanted to this past
weekend, but despite that, we got a couple of
wins,” said RJ. Roewe '09 on the team‘s over

”It feels kind ofweird to move up
in the retard books, I’m still not
sure lino; all sunk in yet We try
to foals on one game at a time
since we have the possibility to
host the tournament,”

John Grotberg ’09

all pertonnanee during the two games, Rocwe
scored 6 points on Saturday agauist Beloit, and
started both games, “it wasn't our best, hut we
got it done,"

rly. Grotherg's 12 sreals tn the game set a new
Gnnnell singleegamc record, and his 33 pOIntS
put him third on the alletime list

“It feels hind ofweitd to move up in the re-
cord bonks,"Grotbei'g said. “I’m still not sure it
has all slink in yet. We try to focus on one game
at a time since we have the possibility to host
the tournament."

With the three wins
this past week, the Pioneers
clinched a spot in the four-
team MWC Tournament.
More importantly, however,
is the fact that there is still a
possibility for Gnnnell to host
the MWC Tournament But
for that to happen, Grinnell
will need 5L Norbert College
to lose to Lawrence and Car~
mll Universities.

“1 think we got about a 50
percent chance right now," Roewc said, “The
leaguC is messy and Ceitaln people hate to lose
for us to be able to host it. So, we're not in (Iriw
er‘s seat, but we still have a shot."
