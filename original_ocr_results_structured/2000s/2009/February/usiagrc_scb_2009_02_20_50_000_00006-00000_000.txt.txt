Best supporting Actress: Artgbl This is the c egory

this category Her performance in Donn as Mrs Muller,
a mother whose son might have been abused by a priest,
is wrenching. Dairis gets only one cxtcndcd scene in the
movie (around to cull minutes long), hot she still manages
to delivers a master class in acting, sniglc-baiidedly defining

As an actor, I basically live for the Academy Awards, and
while Slumdog might be a lock for Best Picture, there are still a
number afclasc races out there:

Best Actor: The race comes clown to two superb itc—
tors who are neck and neck for the piizc:$cnt1 lenn for
his passionate ti-ansroimitiic, and fully invested turn
as gay san Francisco City supervisor Harvey Milk.
and Mickey Rourke for his stripped down, soul hear-

son. While Roiirke's character as a little nioie sting,
my vote goes to sean Penn tor an Lnrncst and iiplitting
performance,

Best Actress: We have illlulhti ['WO'WA)’ iiice hcrc

Oscar complaining: all American tradition

Mark: Well with en covering pretty much all lin-
gcring debate and sapp' g rip all possible cndcaiing cn~
tlirrsiasm in this unto. trinatcli predictable Oscar season,
this leaves the two or us with but one option. It s time to
open up the complaint department.

Pat: chh, as much .15 we like it when our favorite
movies ivin, it’s inst . 5 fun to complain about the Cllliui’
ally inept Oscar voter-s when they screw it rip. Remember
when CHIS/J won? We do, and wc'tc still biltcr'

Mark: Ah, ics, Ciai/i baersin 101 {or white ripper
middle class sirbui.banites Touching strnf.

Pat: Thankfully, the good people or Holliavood have
found a bunch orcasily stereotyped movies to nominate
this year. You’ve got guaranteed winner S/iiinirog Mil/ione
trim (Intro to Global DCi’ClOPnIEnI Studies), which folr
lows char/7’s lead of exposing moviegoers to previously
unknown cultures, but at least does so in a {in better and
more entertaining way.

Mark: Then you’ve got T111 Reader (the token Hoe
localist noniincc), which provides further evidence that
the Oscars should just make a separate category for these
things. Next comes Frau/Nixon (catharsis fat old, bite
ter Democrats) followcd by Mira (look everyone, llol-
lywood's way more tolerant than those hiclg Baptists in
the Soiithl).

Pat: And of course, The Cm rein Cara afﬁrm/11mm Bil/r
[4711 (the prequel to For-rm chirp). While I’m used to the
Oscars sticking to their formulas, it's particularly annoy
ing to see the same approach this year, with seine uni-
versally loved movies getting the shaft, notably Tin» Dark
Killghl and WalleE.

Mark: Right, the best two movies of the year and os-
car voters are convinced they can make us all happy by
givmg a posthumous Best Supporting Actor to Heath
Ledger and giving Wall-E the sloppy seconds that are
Best Animated Feature and Best original screenplay,

PM: They aren't ciren doing these awards right, either.
Instead of an cinotional speech from Michelle Williams
and token references to their three-year-old, we'll get
Christopher Nolan trying to justify a riverininirte stands
iiig ovation with the same lame speech he gave at the
Globes.

Mark: But wait, what il’Dm'At King/:1 won? \Vouldu't
that bring a Sliiirrr/egrlike backlash, where we pick apart
the movie until it‘s impossible to like? We spent .i fair
amount or that movie laughing at Christian Hale's abs-or
lutely ihsiri-d Batman voice. lfthis movie was actuallyiii
contention, it would get way woi 5c.

Prat: But yoir have to give a superhero monC credit for
bringing us both an Oscarrwinniiig performance and a
nihilrstic plotline. I've been waiting my whole lite fol a
movie [(7 win Best Picture that has the ball; to kill soch
one by having a pencil rocketed through their skull.

M'iirkr But somehou I cant deal with the prospects of
.i D/H/J King/n best picture win lvc spent my entire life
thinking that the Oscars are Full of Out’of’iotlcli voters
who only celcbiate iampantly popular movies when they
have no other choice (see Renoir aft/7c King).

Pat: Yeah, they couldn’t even give the award to the
best movi ii the trilogy.

Mark: I just fccl uncomfortable thinking that Oscar-
voters might have the same concept ofan awesome movie
as I do. If they go and give Best Picture to Dm'k Km bl,
Iwon’t like it as much. Somehow, that feels wrong.
Oscars aren't an American tradition. Complaining about
the Oscars is the real American tradition. ,

Prat: It‘s all about yelling at your television or embar-
tassing yourself in south Lounge. That's real passion. 1f
the Oscars aren’t going to provide an open bar like the
Globes, at at least figure out a way to make a four-hour
ceremony cntertai ing, then we’re going to have to pro
vide our own fun.

Mark: If only the Sunday night newspaper meeting
didn't prevent us from attending the gala in Forum south
Lounge. Luckily, we have an alternative. We’re taping
the Oscars. Our bitter, cynical, but still energetic Oscar
party will commence around midnight in Haines Lounge.
All are invited for a few solid hours ofsarcnsm.

Par: Except when we cheer for Mickey Rourkes hope-
fully awesome Best Actor acceptance speech.

Mark: As We wait, we will sit back, relax, down some
beers, and await the entrance of a singing and dancing
Hugh luckman, In u pctfect world, he'd do the whole
show as Wolverine.

Pat: And we'd still complain.
