Don‘t forget the hate crimes

Ayeiragothisweck,asenesofharecr-uncs
were committed, targeting people whom the
itggtessols identiﬁed as queer. A womm came
back to her dorm room to find the word “dyke”
written around her door. In the following
weeks, it number of students repeatedly to
ceiveti anonymous marl telling them tlittt“God
hates fags/dykes" and that they should go “eat
some pussy"or “suck some dick,"

While the vandalism and the hate mail
mm: as a horrible shock to many on this
campus, others saw it as a ltrrgctscole example
of what many members of our community
(that is, the Grinnell community) cxpcricnce
throughout their time on campus.

It’s easy to talk about “The Year of the
Hate Crimes" or the “Swastika Incident of
2005," It's easy to convince ourselves that
these are isolated incidents, committed either
by people who are “un-Grrnncllinn"or who do
not actually go here. People claimed that they
saw “townies” in the loggias, and we tried to
convince ourselves that they must have sent
the letters

However, these are not isolated “10’
dents, and they are continually committed by
Gtinncllians. Within the past few months,
students have been harassed for dancrng l‘OT
mantrcally with a partner of the same sex, a
student had a glass bottle thrown at them her
cause of their nonenormative gender expteSe
sion, and students presenting on behalf of a
group for students of color had a trustee yell at
them that “separate is never equal,"

The events oflast spring have had a lasting
effect on many on this campus. We remain
angry, sad, fearful, and deeply hurt. We are an-
gry that while there was an amazing outpour-
ing of conversations and support immediately
after the hate crimes, this wave has lapsed. We
are sad that these events have been so easily
forgotten and ignored by many. We are fearful
that at any time this could happen again. We
are deeply hurt because many of our friends,
our peers, out professors, and out administrae
tors remain unwilling to engage in sustained
dialogue around these issues.

As we remember last year’s hate crimes and
become more conscious of the prevalence of
homophobia, heterosexism, rausm, classism,
sexism. ableism and other forms ofoppression
on this campus, we need to challenge ourselves
to question the language and actions ofothers
as well as to look introspectively at our own
use oflanguage and choice of actions. With
each new class, institutional memory fades. It
is essential that we start remembering, stop
making excuses. and take pride in creating an
inclusive, safe, and supportive environment for
all members of the Grinnell community

Inviting ROTC back to Grinnell

In a few weeks, my senior friends will grad-
uate and start doing all sorts ofcool shit.They
will go onto graduate school, the Pcacecoips,
Teach for America, Capitol Hill, Wall Street,
and no doubt some corner of the globe I've
never heard of. curiously enough though, in a
country mired in its seventh year ofwttr almost
no one will enter the ini ' rry.Thrs deﬁciency,
as much as issues of toleration or opprcssion,
deserves our consideration.

What follows isn't a rccriiiti g pitch (I'll
leave that to common-ins of M ncs scaling
rock faces in CltisstA uniforms). Iristctid,i s n
thtrest that we as n cimpus consider inviting
(N)ROTC hack to Grinnell. Reestablisliing ti
chnptcr would at once support diversity, public
service, and the legitimate security interests of
the United States.

1. Diversity. The college's commitment to
cconomrc and intellectual diversity is i cor—
Iicrstonc ot social justice. An (N)ROTC unit
would be a major boon to that diversity, Not
only would it provide scholarships to students
who could not otherwise afford private tuition,
bur it would encourage a broadcr idcologi-
cal and poltical range of students to consider
Grinnell,

2, Public Service. By not participating in
ROTC we cedc the power of physical force
to thugs and BusiricsstAdmin majors, I leave
it to you to decide who is more darrgcrous. It
is imperative that humanistic, critical students
have influence over the power of violcncc lost
it be abused in our name. To cxctcisc force, I
grantyou, implies the as mption ofguilt. But
[0 disavow the responsi lities of power and
service can lead to culpability in a still greater
guiltmthat ofinaction in the face of evil. Ask
yourself, would a Grinnellian have let Abu
Ghrurb happen?

3.Tlie Security of the United States. Mlli’
tary operations in the 21st century will be
dominated by lowdevel conﬂicts, counteracts
rorrsm operations and humanitarian missions.
In this climate, analytical and communicative
skills bccomc paramount. American military
officers must today interact with civilians,
speak foreign languages and incisivcly analyze
complex threats in a manner consistent withm
and indeed dependent on—the ideals ofa lib-
eral arts education.

Its time to ask (N)ROTC back to Grinnell
for the beneﬁt of the College and the nation.
In .my case, what else are you supposed to do
with that English major.>

Response to Concerts staff ed

I've been involved with concerts since I got
here (a year and a halfago, or something), and
while understanding the spirit of your staff ed,
1 disagree with it entirely. It’s the same hats
erade, uninformed stuff you hear on a typical
Friday night: “Man, Concerts, you guys really
suck. You didn’t bring anybody good last set
mester.I love Kings ofLeon.You should bring
those guys. And my friend here loves Damian
Rice. You should bring him, he’s really awet
some. And let me talk to you about Films, too,
man, they suck..."

Kings of Leon and Damian Rice arc, to
be honest, exactly the kind of quality that
Grinnell Concerts is least equipped to bring,
and will never be well equipped to bring, and
SHOULDNT BE wellrequipped to bring. If
you love Kings ofLeon so much, go see them
in Iowa City, where the University of Iowa
Concerts Committee brought them last year.
Pay your 330 and have a really good time,
and I really mean that. These artists, however,
represent just the best-intentioned edge of a
wholeslew of other bad ideas about “quality"
in music.

Do you really think that concerts should
bring groups like Ladysmith Black Mombazo
when ACE is perfectly capable of bringing
them? I really loved that show, but its existence
is incredibly tangential evidence for critiquing
concerts.

And Indie? What does that label even
mean? Does it cover Fucked Up, Someone Still
Loves You Boris Yeltsin, the Blow, and Blue
Scholars? Does it count towards Liars? Does
it count towards Peter Brotzmann? What
about Capillary Action and Bird Names? A
cursory look at the Concerts schedule fol the
two years I have been here would reveal rhttt
the programming includes quite .r bit of“norr
Pitchfork-approved”(I am assuming this rs the
standard you are using for “indie", and I find
it incredibly fucrlc) music. Does it mean just
whatever i ccrtirn group ofpeople like? I don't
know what it means at all. And “Indie" bands
provide great mine,

For 30 thousand, you gct cirher Gliostface
or ten indie bands I want you to make the case

that Gliostfacc is worth missmg Fucked Up
about ten times.

DON'T GIVE CONCERTS A
THUMBS UP AND THEN SHOVE THE
SAME THUMB UP ITS ASS!

A Fi’m’s take on the staff ed

Lust week's stntf editorial suggested that
the Concerts and Frlms Committee should fo-
cus more on bringing a select schedule ofbig-
name bands and popular movies rather than a
larger number ofless hyped groups and films,
As a member of the Films Committee and
avid fan of the Concerts Committee, I would
like to expose some problems with this piece
by pointing the editors to other articles they
printed in the very same issue ofthe scale

Refer first to the discussion between two
editors on page six, where thc movies loved by
the Academy Awards were rightfully lament-
ed for how their oftentimes bland formulas or
problematic agendas should not result in such
praise and popularity.

Althortgh the best pic nonis did leave out
WALLVE and The Dark Knight, the Oscars
still tend to be dominated by popular films (see
Sltrmdog, LotR, etc). At the very least, lndET
pendent and foreign films rarely make appear
ances m the Best Pic Category

Meanwhile, the ﬁlms committee consISt
tently brings big grossersilike WALLtE and
Batman. But ifwe stopped there, as the article
suggests, we'd be failing to attend to another
issue brought up on the page adjacent to the
editorialmdivcrsity at Grinnell.

When negotiating the issue of quality and
quantity, we have to question to what extent
the latter determines the former. The editov
rial's argument equates the quality ofa choice
made by the committees with the size of the
turnout at the event. But this leaves out ques
tions like: whose definition of quality is this?
Who are these “quality" movies catering to?
Who is being left out in this equation? How
many people at an event does it take to make it
a worthwhile choice?

can we determine this by the price paid
by each individual in attendance in relation to
the cost of the event? No. That’s because the
activities fee is the same for everybody—we're
in this grand project of weekend entertain-
ment together, and that's precisely why it's so
Valuable to offer awealth ofpossible entertainv
ment options.

We're all into different things at Grinnell,
which is what many otus love about this place,
and that fact needs to be respected by the comt
mittees in charge of supplying us with choices.
This means bringing movies like Twilight, a
movie a lot of people enjoyed on Valentine’s
Day (yes I admit it, I'm one of these). But it
also means bringing Synecdoche, New York,
for the small but undoubtedly die-hard group
ofCharlie Kaufman fans out there (yes I admit
it, I'm one of these).

Also, remember another reason that films
and concerts bring so many small»scale events
is because they're cheaper, hence getting the
students more options for their money. What’s
not economical about films’ strategy of brings
ing a handful ofless well-known (or as is more
often the case, simply less recently released)
movies for the price of one box office grant,
which we also bring? Also, the editorials sugt
gestion that there are too many film screens
ings is irrelevant rrr terms of costmwc buy
the rights upfront, it's not like each screening
costs more money, And about Concerts, hear
in inrnd rharbig name doesn't always equal big
payeoff, Remember when the coritroversially
etpensivc Jean the Currie and made fun ofus
for it whole set? Tlicn remember when anti—
mtuustr-ctm circus punk marching band Muc-
ca Pazza came and blew our socks off while
sousnphoning our eirs> Diversity t choices =
way more possibilities than that new logo.
