Community Arts lncOrporates students

HYALYSIAVALLAS -
Many a curious soul has wondered what will become of
the old Stewart Library building now that a new library has
been built along 5th Avenue. Ifyou were one ofthe curious,

don’t fret. The town’s charming building will be put to good -

use by orrcring Grinnell Area Arts Council a new home

The Arts Council, which currently resides in an office in
the Mcrchants' Bank, was founded in 1979 to pioVide Glll‘l’
nell's community with programs and events that promote art
appreciation,Throughout the years, rho council his put rot-tit
effort to bring
musical talents
to town and has
created numer—
‘ous programs to
foster the attiSr
tic development
of Grinnell's
youngsters. The
Grinncll Corn-
munity Theater,
Thursdays' Mir
sic in the Park, Studio 6 and the Gtinnell Summer Arts Camp
are all brainchildren of the council and its members.

Now, with the relocation to the old library, the council is
looking to develop new programs and expand its existing ones,
particularly its foreign language classes and its artist residency
program. The artist residency program offers artists the op
portunity to reside in Grinnell tor a few weeks and present
their art in a ﬁnal show. With this expansion, however, comes
a need for outside help. “Being a nonprofit organization, we
don’t have the funds and so we appreciate our volunteers so
much,”]udy Arendt, the Art Director, said.

In the past, Grinnell students have helped to form a For,
tion of the volunteer body. Aniko Drllk-Muehleck ’11 spent
this past summer hard at work with the council, instructing
dance and Spanish and assisting Arendt.

Drlik-Muehleck spoke highly ot her experience. “I think
it’s a really great way to get to know the community and to
build a stronger relationship between the college and the
town, to bridge the gap in the disconnect,” she said.

DrlileMuehleclt’s involvement hasopened up discussion
about creating more space for students and possibly an interns

Brazil explores imaginative escape

The Cultural Films Committee to 'set generational family saga Cinema Paradiso against the cynically beautiful Brazil

BY COLIN CARR

Thcrc's something about Director Terry
Gilliam's Brazil that exceeds itself. It's a
film that should ultimately be unrelentingly
depressing and cynical, a portrayal of a fu-
ruristie Orwellian dystopia where machines
manhandle their owners and bureaucracies
make machines of men. Setting the film in
Britain, Gilliam takes retro noir sets and fills
them with gizmos that are absurdly elaborate
enough to be funny. Similarly entertaining
are the bureaucrats, the endless repression
and the superficiality of” its captives, and the
squalid shadowy aura this stuffis buried' in.

All ofit is rendered with the kind ofdaffy
love that evokes the best British screwball
comedy. Gilliam wants to explore the kind
of traps society can lead itself into-to viv-
idly illustrate the perverse ways our society
can condition us to behave. Even so, this film
lacks a practical response to issues of totali-
tarianism in a technology centric culture It
pretcrs to revel in the madness otthese probr
lems and, in its indifference to solutions, it is
somewhat childlike.

And yet, somehow, in the craft behind the
daft, Gilliam demonstrates the most obvious
solution to all the hoi'rorihis own elastic and
ingenious imagination. Gilliam provides us
with a protagonist as spirited as he is. A how

level governmental bureaucrat, Sam Lowry
(Jonathan Pryce) seems like a bit of a prat
on the outside. Consistently interrupted by
his superiors, always desiring to leave a nice
impression yet incapable of leaving a strong
one, Lowry often earns our pity. His quiet dc»
cency is made even more poignant by the dire
predicament hisjob forces him to investigate.

Due to a hilariously unlikely bureaucratic
mishap involving a houseﬂy and a typewriter,
Britain’s police unjustly arrest Harry Buttle,
mistaking him for terrorist Archcbald “Har-

ry.”Tuttle Much of the film consists of LOW’
ry nobly trying to rectify this fiasco and get—
ting into more and more trouble the harder
he tries.

But don't think Lowry’s spiritedness Sm,
ply stems from moral rigor. The real kinship
Lowry and Gilliam share is one oriinagina-
tion. Lowry has complexly rendered fantaSies
about a blond beauty, the two ofthem soaiing
rogerhcr ﬂirtatiously, suspended in inidrair by
a jawrdropprng, seemingly inﬁnite expanse of
steely file cabinets. It is a lush daydream, one
that reassembles the raw materials of bleak
futurthnmin into something transcendent
and tun enough to be redemptive. Lowiy
spends his dayrto-day existence in a living
nightmare. but what does it matter, when
the stuff of nightmares can birth the prettiest

The Kid:

Cloudy With a

fantasies?

There are two theatrical versions of Brazil.
There's Gilliam‘s director’s cut, 142 minutes
long. And there's the originally released ver-
sion (spoiler alert), six minutes shorter, with
a somewhat ambiguously happy ending and
derisively referred to as the “Love Conquers
All" versionithe implication being that the
original version shows evil winning out. Yet
our cinematic gut tells us that in Brazil love
does conquer all, With or without the extra
six minutes. In Brazil, love is imagination,
the ability to wrap the dreamiest embellish-
ments around the nittyegritty of whatereally~
happened. By underlining the absurdities in
his futuristic Britain regime, Gilliam strips it
ofits monstrous power And by escaping into
his madcap fantasies, Lowry provesiin a
cheerfully non- Orwellian fashion—that even
oppression has its limits.
