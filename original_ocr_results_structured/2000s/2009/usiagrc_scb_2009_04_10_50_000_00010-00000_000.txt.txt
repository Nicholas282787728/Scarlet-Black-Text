You may have seen David Western, Political science,
around campus, or you might be in his popular class, Peace and
How to Achieve It. Either way, the Mellon Postdoctoral Fel-
low and Lecnrrer in Peace Studies has an interesting storjiian
artemptcd music career that evenniaily landed him in mtema~
tioriitl leltttions studies,

The Terrace, British Columbia native was drawn to smallc
town Iowa beeause ofrts pastoral beauty. “Well,l grew up in the
most beautiful place nature-wise with eagles and woods,yon just
had to be wary of the bearsibutl was told Grinnell is a place
you want to go,"Westem said. “1 wanted to go to liberal arts coir
iege and the. Peace Studies program has the same approach to
peace studies as i do with practical applications and questions
that rs not just focusing on political science but peace snrdies as
multidisciplinary."

After 18 years growmg up in the northwestern part odenr
ada, Western moved to Vancouver to pursue music. He picked
up a guitar at age 14 and became obsessed and believed that it
was hrs destrny to become a rock star and be a political activist
like Bono.

Music was westerns first love. He played or a rock band for
four years during the early 90's during the Nirvana, grunge mu-
sre period. “it was a hard time, i had to sacrifice in order to live
that life, going several days without food, but i wasnt mature
enough to make ir,"wesrerm said, “I didn't want to be mature
and professional. I wanted to make my music and be passionare
about it."

After working a range ofodd jobs, from workrng at a video
srore to community service work, at the age ofzs, wesrem real-
ized he wanted to figure out a way to do more with his rnten
ests in humanitarian work which he had explored through his
music. “i went back to school, out it was a natural progression
because I had done well earlier in school,” Western said,“l der
cided to do a correspondence course rhen wear to rhe Univer—
sity of Victoria which was an amazing environment of envir
ronmenrnliy friendly people wrrh lots ofbike paths and public
transit and natural beauty,”

western ended up applying to the international relations
program at Brown University for a PhD. “I hadn't fully thought
about whatI wanted to do after completing my Political science
degree, but I was told to consider graduate school and pointed
towards Brown by professors,"wesrern said.“I hadn't even heard
ofisrown before i applied and when I got there i had a massive
culture shock, Despite what people thiiikilike that episode of
the srmpsorrs where Bait calls Canada as USA in, Canada and
the us are a lot different.

The 36—yeartold rwo~yenr postdoctoral fellow is enjoying
his time at Giinncll, though he says that being a vegan here
is a challenge. According to western, Griiinell is kind oflike
the Brown of the liberal arts colleges, except Grinnellrans seem
friendly and co.nmnnrry»or-ienrcd. “Iowa reminds me more of
Canada, especially the neighborliness." Western said. “People
stop to say hi and chat hereThars a lot different than the East
Coast."

Easy, tasty springtime treats

The arrival ofspring (in name, at least, even rfrhe weather
doesn’t always reflect it) brings with it many joys, not the least
of which is the dimming of the need for red merit and a rise
in the desire to eat fresh fruit. A crisp, tart Fuji apple slathr
ered with extra—Chunky peanut butter is delicious and read-
ily available in the dining hall. but after eating them for two
months straighr, a person tends to develop some cholesterol
issues.

Since fruit is supposed to be moderately healthy, I offer you
three easy alternatives,

Hmszt

Since the Jewish holiday ofPassover has just started,I recr
ommcnd eating this on mamah.

During the seder, or Passover meal.

haroset is meant to represent the

mortar that the Jews used as slaves

in Egypt—but significantly better

to eat. You'll need a sharp knife,

a bowl (clean Tupperumre works

well), a measuring cup, and a mixing implement. Peel six apples
and chop into roughly onerinch chunks.Toss wrth about a tear
spoon of lemon juice. Roughly chop 3/4 cup ofshelled walnuts
and add to the apples, along with a teaspoon ofcinnamon and
1/4 teaspoon ginger. Pour in 1/. cup sweet wine—Manischewitz
is traditional, Refrigerate at least four hours to let the wine
soak in.

Guacamole

Perfect food for watching basketball on TV. I recommend
making this directly in whatever container you'll use to store
it. You’ll need a sharp knife, mixing spoon and container. The

avocadocs should have a little give but not be mushy when
you squeeze them, Peel and mash five ripe avocadoes, stirring
in one teaspoon salt, a teaspoon of lime juice, and one table-
spoon frnely chopped cilantro, Core and seed two small fresh
jalapenos, and dice very finely. Slice two fairly ripe tomatoes
rnto onerrnch chunks. Gently combine the. tomatoes and jalar
pcnos with the avocado. Serve with good tortilla chips or eat
lain,

P Fried Flantains

I became addicted to planrains in Ecuador over winter
break, and this is quite possibly the best way to serve them.Ycu
can find planrarns in HyVee or WalrMarr; I've never checked

Fareway. They turn black as they
ripen, and are significantly bigger
than bananas. Find the darkest
planrains you can, since the green
plantains won’t be very sweet when
cooked. You'll need a frying pan, a
spatula, and a knife, as well as some
towels or a mesh rack to drain the planrains. Assume one plan—
tain per person.

To pccl a plantain,cnt itintu thirds widthwrsc and then run
your knife under the peeliit’s more stubborn than a regular
banana pccl. Slice the plantain: into rounds, about 1/2” thick; if
you cut rhem too thick, they'll end up burning. Pour vw- yr" of
vegetable oil into the frying pan. and heal it on n‘iedlun‘rl‘iigl‘l
(depending on your stove). Add the plantain in a single layer;
it's fine to cook it in batches, Cook for one to two minutes, u“,
ril the bottom is goldcn-brown, and then flip the planrains and
repeat, Drain and serve hot.
