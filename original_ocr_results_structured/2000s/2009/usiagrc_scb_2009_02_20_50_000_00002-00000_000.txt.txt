Bruigrl Tram magazine is opening
up the task of selecting its annual list of
America's Coolest Small Towns to onlinc
voters from across the globe. Out ofthe 22
finalists, Gi-innell is one of the Compcrlr
tors seeking the title of“coolest".

The magazine’s editors chose the con-
tenders from among 152 readerenominate
ed towns with populations under 10,000.
In addition to the online poll that will run
through early March, the final selection
ofthe ten “coolest towns" will be based on
comments, photos and videos submitted
by website visitors describing why their fan
vorite town should be featured.

The competition is seeking “places that
are kind of offrthcrradar and aren’t tourist
destinations, but are great places to visit
and great places to escape to," according
to Media Relations spokesperson Lauren
Gould at Budgel Trarul “NOW people are
sticking to trips that are close to home, so
[the contest] is a way to look at these small
town treasures that wouldn‘t normally be
looked at by travel magazmes,"

Gould said that Grinnell’s current po-
sition as a finalist is alone enough to vali-
date Grinnell as a quality small town, “For
a town to make it past the first round, there
has to be a quality that sets it apart,"Gould
said. ”With Grinnell it was the history he
hind the town, and that it has really good
architecture and has stayed true to that are

Grinnell may be “Coolest Small Town”

The city of Crinnell finds itself in the top tier of finalists for magazine’s contest

chitetturc for over a hundred years."

SGA President NCO Morakc '09, who
posted a link to voting on GrinnellPlans
said that she was first alerted to the con-
test in an cemail from Assistant Tennis
Coach and frequent town-gown liaison
Bill Mennei. “I'm really excited," Morakc
said. “If it’s more press for Grinncll it’s
good, and the town is nice There are a lot
of things that you really wouldn't get in a
big city,"

Gtinnell residents of both town and
gown persuasion offered mixed pi-cdice
tions about Grinnell's onlinc popularity.
“The Winter’s pretty awful, but other times
of the year it looks pretty nice," said Nick
Johnson, who grew up and lived in town
until he left to attend Kenyon College this
year. “It takes a certain kind of aesthetic to
think Iowa’s pretty, one that not everybody
has.”

“Grinnell's cool for reasons I don’t think
it has any control over," said Emily Iwuc
'08, who lived in town for nine months 3f,
tcr graduation and recently moved to Mine
neapolis. “lt has a lot ofcool people living
in it, but the town itself isn't that unique. 1
do think Grinnell’s a really cool place, I’m
just not sure why it was nominated."

Asked what his reaction would be
if told that Gtinnell had been voted the
Coolest Small Town in America, Johnson
said “I guess I would say, that's coolThat's
where I'm from."

The cover Letter, also known as the Application Letter, puts your experience into context and provides employers

The Cover Letter format is similar to that of a traditional letter and includes your address, the date, a speciﬁc letter
recipient's name, title, and address, and your signature. The opening paragraph tells why you’re writing, how you found the
position, and what skills you offer. strong middle paragraphs highlight relevant aspects of your resume, emphasize elements
of your research experience, and link your skills and experience to the job and organization. l-‘mally, the closing paragraph
summarizes the skills you have to offer, suggests a next step in the process, and thanks the reader for their time and attention.
