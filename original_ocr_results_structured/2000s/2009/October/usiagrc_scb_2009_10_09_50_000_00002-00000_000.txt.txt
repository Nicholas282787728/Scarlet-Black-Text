Excess printing becomes issue

According to Francis, one pay option would include using
a combination ofpay as you go with a set quota ofprints per
student.

Francis said that this system would be beneﬁcial to most
organizations on campus when considering cases with stu-
dents who either have excessive printingjobs, versus students
who do not need much printing.

“ITS would not have to act unilaterally to determine ei-
ther quota size or persprint fee," Francis said.

If the college administration and ms do not implement a

Students may soon find themselves having to think twice
before clicking “File” and then “Prim" when using campus

concern oflnfcrmation Technology services (ITS) and the
college administration, thanks to a reported budget ofaround
$2 million for this year's net college printing, according to
Vice President for Institutional Planning Marci Sortor.

these untouched printed
documents accumulate as

to careless mistakes people
on campus make.

"I think that this often

will have to revamp budgets
to include the high printing

“One option is to offer
free printing, while address-

ITS is not sure when the

take place.

Some of Sather’s ideas
range from reading docu-
ments on laptops to print-
ing double-sided papers as
a standard, to bringing readr

According to sortor, excessive printing is additionally
the by-product otincreased student reliance on Internet and
computer documents in place ofbooks.

“It's a growing problem since we've been using the Inter»
net," Sortor said, “We’re onlinc a lot more—it’s easy to just
hit ‘print.'We have a problem where too many people print
documents and never pick them up,"

The college administration, ITS and SGA are currently
discussing a wide array ofsolutions to this problem.

“ITS is in the exploratory phase," Francis said. “We are
looking around at other schools and different technologies
to see what systems work and we are interested in systems
that reduce unnecessary printing by using a reasonable charge
rate."

Francis also encourages students to take part in the policy
making process.

“We are interested in the creative ideas of others on cam-

student Technology Advisory Council, and will be talking
with faculty through the Instructional support Committee
tomorrow and Joint Board a week from tomorrow."

While most solutions being considered involve some type
of fee, Satlier recommends alternative solutions that students
and faculty can take and be part of.

sather said “Grinnclllans are creative enough to find ways to
