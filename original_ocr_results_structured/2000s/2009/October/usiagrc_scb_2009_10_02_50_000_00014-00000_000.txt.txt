October

Bansal believes in Broncos’ ability, vision!

After a hectic off—season of trades, quarterback controversies and media scrutiny, the Broncos delivers early this season

The comingor autumn means .differ-
ent things to different people, For many
Grinncllians, it means the beginning otane
other challenging, yer thoroughly enjoyable
school year. It also means that it is merely
another few weeks before the boneschills
ing winds come and dry our souls as com-
pletely as they dry our skin—but I digress.
For me, the coming of autumn means one
thing above all elseithe beginning of the
NFL season. High school football is good,
college football is great, but nothing quite
compares to
watching the
best of the
best compete
against each
other in the
pros.

W h i l,e
the 2009—10 .
NFL season is still young, it has already
manufactured several compelling sto-
rylines. Perhaps no story is as surprising.
though, as the undefeated Denver Broncos.
Left for dead by the football media after
trading star quarterback Jay Cutler to the
Chicago Bears, the Broncos have won their
first three games of the season, and have
looked extremely impressive in doing so.

The outlook for the 2009 season was
bleak for the Broncos after a tumultuous
ottseason, After firing their head coach of
13 seasons, two—time Super Bowl Cham—
pion Mike Shanahan, the Broncos made
the bold move of hiring 32syear-old josh
McDaniels. McDaniels is best known as
the OJlarterbacks’ coach and Offensive
coordinator for the New England Patriots
from 2004—2008 under media bad boy Bill
Belichick. Upon taking the job in Denver,
McDaniels almost immediately clashed

with Cutler who demanded a trade and got
one to the Chicago Bear in return, the
Bloncos received otrcn- 'zed quarter
back Kyle Orton and multiple high-draft
picks.

As ifon cue, the media tore into McDans
iels and the Broncos. So~called “experts”
preached how rare it is to come by good
quarterbacks and how owner Pat Bowlen
was foolish to let both Sha'nahan and Cut-
ler walk in the same offseason. Besides bee
ing unusually young for the position, Mce

.- - Daniels had
no previous
experience as
a head coach
and the coin
lective NFL
world won-
dered whether
this was really
an improvement over Shanahan—tho win‘
ningest, most beloved coach in the history
of the Broncos'franchise. McDaniels’ status
as a Bill Belichick disciple further hurt his
credibility with the media, players and the
fans,

All the controversy surrounding Mcs
Daniels, along with various other issues,
such as star receiver Brandon Marshall
coming off a major hip surgery and the
defense licking their wounds aftet ﬁnish»
ing 29th last season, combined to deﬂate
expectations for the Broncos 2009 season
to an all’llme low. ,

Yet, somehow, the Broncos are 3,0 and
find themselves atop the AFC West.

Granted, the season is only three weeks
in, and skeptics are quick to point out that
the Broncos have not beaten a 2008 play—
off team. However, the Broncos have absos
lutely demolished the last two teams they

have played, beating the BIowns 27—6 and
the Raiders, on the road, 23s3. In fact, the
only close game the Broncos have played
this year is their season opener against
the Cincinnati Bengals, in which they just
squeaked by for a 12-7 road victory. These
are the same Bengals that beat the Packers
at Lambeau Field and, last week, beat the
defending super Bowl Champion Pitts-
burgh Stcelers. _

Forget the qualitative stuff, though, let’s
look at the numbersThe stats tell a tale of
stout defense and efﬁcient offense. Perhaps
the most telling stat is the amount ofpoints
the Broncos have allowed through their
first three gamesionly 16. To give you a
sense of how ridiculously low that is, the
second lowest total of points allowed this
season is 33, more than twice the number
of points the Broncos have allowed. The
Broncos are tied for first in the league with
10 sacks through three games this season.

On the offensive side of the ball the
Broncos are fourth in the league in rushing,
averaging 158.7 yards per game. Through
the air, the Broncos are 15th in the league
with 215.7 yards passing per game—noths
ing spectacular. However, Kyle Orton is
doing what he has always done throughout
his careerimanaging the game and [amp
tecting the football, The Broncos are one
ofonly two teams in the league, the Packers
the other, to not throw a single interceps
tion this season. People are quick to forget
that Orton is 23—12 as a starter throughout
his five-year NFL career. The bottom line
is that if you give Orton a solid running
game, the man can win games. .

Of course, this was all part of Pat
Bowlen’s shrewd plan to rebuild the Bron-
cos. While no one could have foreseen the
Broncos having the immediate success they

are enjoying now, Bowlen was well aware of
the big picture when pulling the trigger on
the Curler trade. Besides Orton, the Brons
cos also received some high-draft picks
from the Cutler trade with the Broncos.
They converted the first rounder they re
ceived into stud defensive end Robert Ayers
who should help solidify that Broncos pass
rush for years to come. They also picked
seth Olsen, whom Iowa fans know is a very
talented guard with great size. Perhaps even
more important than those draft picks in
the rebuilding of the Denver Broncos is the
money they saved by unloading Jay Curlers
contract onto the Chicago Bears. Cutler is
in the third year of a six-year, 1547.86 mils
lion deal. While most of that money has
already been paid to him, believe me when
i tell you the Broncos are still saving a lot
of money, which they have used to bring in
prized free agents such as linebacker Andra
Davis and defensive end Vonnie Holliday.
The Broncos have laid down a very solid
template on how to rebuild a football team
after a slough of disappointing seasons.
They did what most organizations lack the
cajones to doidisposc of the star player
and legendary coach in order to benefit the
team. As a result of these bold personnel
decisions, the team took a lot of flak from
the media, which in turn led to deﬂated ex—
pectations for the season, expectations that
severely underestimated the talent level of
the team and the coaching ability of josh
McDaniels. Remember, this is the man_that
ran the Patriots offense while Tom Brady
was rewriting the record books with his
passing proﬁciency. The fact of the matter
is that the Broncos are a good team and I
fully expect them to challenge for the AFC
West title and a playoffspol this season.
