Liberal Arts in Prison Program continues to expand

Since 2003,Grinnell College has extended teaching far beyond
campus, into untraditional territoryitwo Iowa prisons. Through
the Liberal Arts in Prison Program, Grinnellians either tutor in~
mates or reach ﬁve- or terrweek courses on subjects ranging from
Psychology to European History. student teachers are joined by
their own professors who come once a week for a lecture series.
Grinnell professors also reach one hillelength course a semester.

The progmm has expanded exponentially since it began with
Howard Burkle, Professor Emeritus ofReligious Studies. Six years
ago, Burldc taught a creative writing class based in restorative juse
tice along with four Grinnell students. It has evolved into an ens
tirely studentetaught operation after this ﬁrst class, and continued
that way until last Full.

Emily Guenther’07, the Coordinator ofLibcral Arts in Prison,
helped spearhead a change to the program that allows prisoners to
earn college credit, which can be transferred to other institutions
upon the inmate’s release.

“I approached Kathleen Skarrert and asked her if it was pos-
sible,"GuenLher said. “We managed to ﬁnd some money for it."

Although a professor raughr a class last spring, this fall is the
ﬁrst time that courses will earn inmates credit—next semester,
the credit they earn will go to a certiﬁcate.

“Last spring. the faculty approved :1 five year pilot program
based around a 407credit certiﬁcate that incarcerated students can
earn," Guenther said.

40 credits are roughly two thirds ofan Associate orArcs, and
are just under the number of credits that a student can mmsfer, All
ofthe classes thatwill be olrcred are designcd to be easily transfer
able.

The accredited classes are rigorous, which makes the program
reliant upon the strident-taught classes and tutors to prepare the
inmates for a collegiate level course. student teachers still must
contend with the wide range ofabilities and educational Otperi~
encc.

Erik Jarvis ’12 reaches a ﬁveerveelt course with Kelsey Hyde
called "Craft of Poetry.”]arvi5 noticed remarkable differences in
his students’ scholarship,

"I was surprised by the variety of education. There are deﬁ-
nitely some guys who are my too good to be in that class—they
should be teaching me. But then there are some guys who don't
really know anything [about the subject],"]arvis said.

The tutoring progmm works to close the gaps by having stue
dents work one-on-one with prisoners. Unfortunately, tutors are
only amilable at one orrhc two prisons that Liberal Arts in Prison
program aids.

“Vi/e work at two prisons. Mitchellvillc and Newton. . .One is
the Newton Correctional Facility, and the other one is the Iowa
Correctional lnstitutc for Women," said Student Coordinator of
the program, Eric Ritrer '12.

Liberal Arts in Prison is more established in Newton because
it has been there longer, and includes tutors for the subjects of
math and grammar.

“While we continue to refine Newton we can also begin the
process ofrofinement at Mitchellville,which is a very raw program
right now,” said Ritter.

Tutoring is the next step at Mitchellville, but improvements
are coming to both prisons.

“What 1 hope will happen is to maintain the system ofclasses

that we have right now," Ritter said. “But I want that to coincide
with a program where students are trained as teachers and Lhey get
Grinnell College credit for teaching a course.

Even in its transitional form, the Liberal Arts in Prison pro»

has a major impact on the lives ofthe inmates involved.

“[The inmates] talk about...whnt a saving ace it's been {or
them and how important it's been for them an how afﬁrming it
is in that environment,” Guenther said. "It makes them incredibly
wonderful students."

Rittcr has had similar experiences teaching and coordinating
the program.

"I've had people say to me, 'Wow, I just forgot I was in prison
the last hour and a hal.f,”he said.

Jarvis sees a similar experience for the incarcerated,

“i do think its helping. One ofthe prisoners who runs it is get—
ring out soon. . .and he says that it turns his life around,”said Jarvis.

Gtinneliians teach the inmates, but their involvement in the
prison is really an extension of their experience at Grinnell—they
are learning, too.

“What the men and women teach us every time we go in is
that what we’re doing here is not irrdevant. And that learning it-
self is deeply ammung and is a real need and can really help you
stay huinan,"Guenther said. “I think the best rhing about the pro
gram is that it reinforces and affirms the value of the liberal arts
and ofeducadon in general."
