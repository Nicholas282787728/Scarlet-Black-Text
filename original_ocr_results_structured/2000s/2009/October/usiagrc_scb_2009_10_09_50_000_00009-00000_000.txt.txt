Few people may have actually known this,
but it turns out Grinnell has a chess club.

“I'm not a very good advertiser," Andy
Applebaum '10, leader of the group, said.
Applebaum was mildly selfrdeprecating when
discussing the success of the club during his
four years at Grinnell, saying that just before
he became a student here the club was more
“legitimate".

But Applebaum, who started playing chess
in the first grade, has proved to be a much
better advertiser than he gives himself credit
for, srmply by deciding to move club meetings
from the bowels of Noyce into the heart of
calnpusithe Grille. “More or less 1 bring my
sets and sit here basically, and rhen everybody
shows up to play chess,“Applebaum said.

It’s a metaphorical chessboard ofdreamsi
and people ofall experience levels are coming.
“I came out ora work shift and he was play-
ing chess and I was like, ‘whoam said Michael

Lriwiirnvcr, SUMULoNo

Dougherty '12, one of the newer and some
what less-experienced members of the club,
“I’m really bad and they're just sort
of fostering me"
Not only is the location prime
for attracting new knights and pass
ing closet chess enthusiasts, but,
contrary to popular stereotypes
about chess. the lively environment

and it's hard and so you sweat in those kinds
of situations, So there's no point in wearing a
shirt and being sweaty.“

day nights Outside of the Grille from around 8
pm. onward to engage in “blue chess”(approxr
lmittely ten minute long games in which each
player is limited to five minutes of playing
timcilllso called “doing speed") and “skittles,"
the universally accepted termiof unknown
orrgin~for casual chess games. “Maybe they
used to play for bags of Skittles," Andrew
Howard ’12 said “Maybe Skittles are named
after it," Dougherty said.

Names are actually a key aspect of chess
culture. "Over the years the language has de—
veloped to make it more appealing," Apple-
baum said. Since there are only so many pos-
sible opening moves in a game, they have all
been named and documented in various chess
anrhologiesmand the members of chess club
are able to recreate them with impressive
speed, Favorites include the “the fried liver ate
tack" and “the cabbage", more for their name's
whirnsicality than their overall efficiency.

While Applebaum notes a disappointing
decline in chess enthusiasm—citing the rise in
technologyrbased diversions such as computr

ers and gaming systems as one possir
ble factor—members said quirks such
as code names are not the only reason

WTF am I doing working in the D-Hall?

EV KATHERINE CHUNG

we've all experienced the atrociously long
lines in rhe dining hall, especially during the
start of the year when the sta—
tions are loaded with new ein-
ployees fumbling to keep up
with the hoards of ravenous
students. Often, however, the
aggravation doesn’t stop at the
agonizing wart, but you sit down
to find that your sandwich has
an excess of condiments or your
stirrfry is watery and bland. stu-
dent drners aren't the only ones
confusedimany dining hall
complaints can be traced back to
student workers who themselves
are asking, “WTF am i supposed
to be doing working in the dim
ing hall?"

Turns out, the Grinnell
Dining services offers no formal
employee training component
before workers begin their first
shift. Moreover, once on the job,
students receive only minimal
instruction from supervisors and
are expected to “figure it out"on
their own with the help oftheir
coworkers.

Claire Williams ’13, who
works sanitation, recalls her
confusion on her first day “One
of the supervisors just told me,
Here’s a rag, here's a bucket, Wipe rhe sure
faces. Go,’ without telling me anything else,"
Williams said,

wgi the V”

The problem is often exacerbated when
coupled with the inexperience of“returning"
employees, who are expected to train the new

employees regardless of their
expertise. “Once they gave me
three new people to train, ﬂf’
ter I'd worked my shift once,’
said Susannah siengel ’12,
who works in the deli line.

The lack of employee
training also clouds the re-
sponsibilities and expec-
tations of the employees.
"What they do is they add an
increasingly intricate layer of
rules to ourjob,”Stengel said.
"And they don’t often feel
that it's necessary to include
us in the new rules."

This gap in communica-
tion between employees and
their overseets can make
both parties frustrated, some
times resulting in negative
sentiments. Four of the ﬁve
students interviewed recalled
multiple instances in which
they felt that they were unr
fairly reprimanded by a super
rior for a component of their
job position that was never
explained to them.

Ben Good ’10 recalls a
particularly vexing incident
during the end ofhis lunch Shiftilunch closes
at 1:30—working in the Grill Station. “It was
about 1:28 or so and we liadjust ran out ofone

particular sandwich," Good said. “The head
chef came by and said, ‘what are you doing,
there are no more sandwiches here,’ and kept

estering us until we cooked march-about 10
{of (hemlﬁnd they take about seven minutes
to cook, but no one else came and we had to
throw them away."

Such muddling has not gone unnoticed—
Lyle Bauman, dining hall supervisor and
campus celebrity, recognizes the need to bet»
ter train employees. “we rely heavily on pre-
trained student workers,"Bauman said,“and if
we don’t get those to sign up in the beginning
ofthe year, that’s where we probably fall a little
bit short."

Dining services is currently in the process
of implementing new programs to better pres
pare its employees. For example, Bauman ex
plained rhat serve Safe, at new online course
about food safety, should make health code
expectations clear to employees, who will be
paid tor its Completion There are also training
videos available ominbinitiated and created
by students this past Summerithui employees
are encouraged to watch before starting work.

Though no serious problems have occurred
to date, Bauman sees the improvement ofem-
ployee competence as a priority for the Dining
Hall to ensure the safety and satisfaction of
both employees and customers.

“it's just that an ounce of prevention is
worth a pound ofcure. we want to always look
ahead to prevention versus back toward what
should we have done,“ Bauman said. So next
time you wrntl up caring—or serving—runny
stirrfry, just drain off some of the sauce and
know that things will improve.
