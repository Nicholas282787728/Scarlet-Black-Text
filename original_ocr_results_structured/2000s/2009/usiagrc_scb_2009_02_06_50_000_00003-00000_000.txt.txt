Chris Hade memorial service Saturda

IlY RACHEL FIELDS

Everyone seems to have a story about Chris Hade 09, and
this weekend people will have a chance to gather and share
their tales.

To honor Hade, who passed away Nov 14 after a three
year long battle with cancer, the Chaplains Office will hold a
memorial service in Herrick Chapel at 3 pin. on Saturday. The
service wi include performances oflive music Hade enjoyetli
notably a cappella, Broadways liowtunes and big band 1322735
well as photo and media displays of his time at Grinncll.

Samantha Worzalla 07 met blade in the early days of
his first year. on the Grinnell Outdoor Orientation Program
(GOOF). They were caneeiiig and it was raining steadily
When they eventually found the clock, it was falling apart, and
the boards were submerged and unstable. Worzalla said that
Hade helped everyone else to the trail until the two of them
were left with a canoe and some equipment bags. She helped
him get the canoe onto his shoulders, then watched in amaze-
ment as he teeteted and hopped along 100 feet of submerged
boards to the trail.

“I kept asking him if he was alright and needed help,"
Worzalla said. “He said, in his genuinely cheerful, positive way,
‘Don’t worry about mel i’m a ninja!”

When Harry Krejsa '10, who met Hade while they were
both attending lndianola High School, heard Worzalla’s storyi
he laughed. "He did the same thing when we were backpacking
in Utah," he said. "He would make ninja noises as he kicked
scorpions out of the tent. He never took himselftoo seriously
to not act like a ninja."

stories like this are everywhere. Two years ago, Amanda
Gotcra ’09 was frustrated with the administration's treatment
of disability awareness and accessibility on campus. Hade was
her SGA senator, so she sent him an email to complain. Witlr
in 15 minutes, he had responded with a twmpage plan to make
the campus more disability accessible.

“I was sold,” she said.

Even among those who barely knew him, there seems to be
a consensus that Hade brought a certain light to the Grinnell
campus. His smile, his voice, the graceful way he dismounted
his bike—it was all filled with an easy, genuine charm for those
who knew him. As strange as it seems, his friends said that as
his cancer worsened, he got better,

“His positivity was always astounding," friend Mairead
O'Grady'lO said “I’ll never forget when he told nic,‘Canccr is
great! They give you your own room on the same floor as your
girlfriend when you're a secondsyear, no problem at all!”

Hade was diagnosed with sacral cliortloma, a rare and inopr
erablc cancer, in the spring ofhis first year at Grinnell. Shortly
after his high school graduation, Hade fell at a graduation party
and injured his tailbone. When his mother noticed how much

Center in Houston, then underwent chemotherapy and radia-
tion at Mercy Hospital in Des Moines. But by his third year,
the cancer had spread from Hadc's tailbone to other parts of
his body. Forced to drop out of Grinuell due to his physical
condition, Hade spent the last year in Indianola, Iowa, with his
family anti longtime girlfriend, NattiTipayimongkol '08.

from p. 1 dents confront ‘in their relations
between both faculty and stun
dent Affairs. "it's very obvious
that there’s a conﬂict between Student Af-
fairs and faculty and it’s hard for us [students]
to navigate our role in working with both of
them," Hoyc said.

This tenuous position has become even
more delicate as, according to Osgood, some
faculty members have inappropriately cont
tactcd students. "I have recently received com-
plaints from students and staff and Student
Affairs complaining about interference from
faculty," Osgood said. “[They were] trying to
involve students improperly, contacting them
improperly, repeatedly contacting them. I just
want to be clear, we will not accept that ”

College Trustee Laura Ferguson ’90, who
chairs the Board’s Student Affairs Commits
tee, did not comment on whether such' lnCi‘
dents had occurred, but said that any faculty
or administrative pressuring ofstudcnts would
not be to lcratcd and would prompt Trustee
intervention, “if for example, students are
being unfairly pressured by anybody—any
employees of the College—the Trustees will
deﬁnitely weigh in on that," Ferguson said.
“Because it's inappropriate for anyone in a
position ofauthority to be pressuring out stu»
dents in any way.”

Meehan acknowledged that some profeSt
sors had approached students but said that
they had not behaved inappropriately "It's
one thing to say some people asked ques-
tions, and that‘s quite different from saying
students, faculty, and staff were harasscdia
dramatic difference in characterization," she
said.

“I think that there were some people who
were asked questions who did not want to be
asked questions and did not want more ques
tions being asked, but that’s different than
saying they were harassed," Mechaii said.

Faculty—Admin Relations

In addition to specific grievances over per-
sonnel issues, the overall conﬂict stems in part
from competing conceptions of the faculty’s
appropriate role in student life and its rcliir
tionslup with student Affairs.

While professors demonstrated a willing-
ness to involve themselves in administrative
affairs, Osgood was more skeptical of faculty
engagement, Though he said he encouraged
faculty to voice their concerns to the admin-
istration, Osgood maintained a stricter separ
ration between the two, saying “anything by
which faculty try to involve themselves directr
ly into the administration or personnel inat-
ters in Student Affairs is not a good idea,”

Chair of the Faculty Mark Schneider,
Physics, was reluctant to comment broadly
on what constitutes appropriate faculty cn-
gagemcnt, instead saying that every situation
called for a personal decision and was highly
contextual. “'Thcres not a simple answer that
one can say o,li for any arbitrary faculty mem-
ber, here’s the correct way to behave.’You have
to examine individual circumstances," Schr
neidet said.

“This is a more difficult Instance because
as I say, the people who are raising the coli-
cerns clearly don't have the obvious direct
responsibility for the issues that are causing
the difficulty. certainly, if one feels that there
are really terrible things going on, yeah, you

should make ii fuss about it,” Schneider said.

Schneider said that some amount of ten
sion is inevitable between faculty and adminr
istrators as interests would never fully align
and said that his ZO-plus years at Gtinnell
have been marked with periodic discord her
tween members ofthc two bodies.

Osgood also said that his tenure at the
College has witnessed periods of faculty—
administrative tension and that the current
episode was no more contentious than prcvi-
ous ones.

Professors such as Schneider and Mark
Montgomery. Economics, said that the level
of distrust between some faculty members
and the administration has reached a level
unprecedented during theii time at Grinnell.

“It's fair to say there's been ii conflict with
the administration about how much influence
the faculty can or should have over personnel
issues alid other departments outside the facr
ult’y,” Montgomery said, “There’s more strain
between the faculty and administration than
there has been in my time here, 20 years. i
think slowly the tension has been getting
worse."

Some of those involved, In addition to his
menting the poor relations which have per-
meated the entire episode, expressed frustra—
tion that the matter was even being discussed
at all. “I think it’s not healthy for the institur
tion.1 think that it's inappropriate for there to
be any sort of public discussion of personnel
issues,” Schneider said, “And I think it's very
difficult to have any sort of balanced convert
when about such things because inevitably
any information that is public is only partial.

Admission sees
increase in the
application rate

BYJESSICA BVERLY AND Tessa CHEER

Grinncll Admissions strives to maintain
business as usual and continue to attract pros
spective students.

Acceptanccs for early decision 1 and II zip-
plicants have been made and the regular de-
cision deadline passed jam 1. The Admissions
office said they faced a 50 percent increase in
Early Decision applicants and little change
in regular decision from the class of 2012 to
2013.

Dean ofAdmiss‘ions Seth Allen said that
in an effort to maintain class sizes, the office
accepted a smaller percentage of early decision
applicants aiid plans to lower the acceptance
rate to around 30 percent, compared to 33.5
percent last year, in an effort to avoid a situation
similar to the class of2012’s over-enrollment.

Despite the increase in the early decision
applicants and the stability of regular applicar
tions, Allen said he fears that many accepted
students will be unable to afford a Grinnell
education because of the recent economic
downturn,

According to Director ofFinancial Aid Ar
nold Woods, Grinnell will continue to practice
a need-blind admissions policy for this admis-
sion year and the proposed budget for next year
plans to increase ﬁnancial aid by 15 percent.

"It is our sense that in these financial times
there are families in serious circumstances who
will need more aid from us," Allen said.
