CHAINS: For something that has the potential to be a great way to meet
new romantic interests, it wasnt publicized enough and very few peo—
ple even know that it is happening.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

THE PLAGUE: It is back and it is taking down everyone from our favor-
ite dining hall p-card swipers to that person who sits next to you in
biology. Load up on orange juice, folks, you could be next.

Wear some real pants girls

To all the girls out rhere who think it is fash-
iona‘oly acceptable to wear spandex or tights as
pants. IT’S NOT.

I have yet to encounter a girl in such attire
who can pull it off. Let's he honest, you cun’r
POSSIBLY think you look attractive in that can
you? The amazing thing about 5
ir hugs your body so incredibly close that there
is NOTHING we cannot discern. To be blunt.
there are some things that the general public just:
does not need to see. The precise curvature of
your butt and your panty~linc are a few examples.
So please, can we pur some real pants on and
make everyone just n bit more comfortablc?That
would just be terriﬁc, okay?

Where are the music stands? A random RAVE for Beyance

To everyone who uses the practice rooms in
Bucksbaum:

QUIT STEALING THE FREAKIN'MU-
SIC STANDS! It's really annoying when 1 walk
into a practice mom and the stand is missing.
That means I either have to find another room
with a stand (which is difﬁcult, because they all
seem to hnvo disappeared), or ﬁnd a stand. Both
involve time-wasting awkwardness when I have
to knock on practice room (loons and maybe walk
in on people practicing JUST so l CAN FIND
A MUSIC STAND. It really should not be this
complicated. Just put the stands back in their
original moms when you’re done using them for
whatever group practice thing. Otherwise,1 my
have to walk in on YOU next time.
