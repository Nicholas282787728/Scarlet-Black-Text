The politics of penetration from a lesbian perspective '

Ever since I started masturbating,I have wondered what
heterosexual sex would be like. Don't get me wrongil
don't want to have a penis, and 1 am definitely not envious
of those who do. It's the romantic thought of the intimacy
that two people can share during moments of penetration—
it's such a powerful thing
to know thioughout the
whole day that my lover has
a piece of me inside of her.
But what happens when the

cized? Am I just trying to
imitate “heterosexual sex"
to validate my own “lesbian
sex”? And by doing so, am i becoming an imitator of“male
supremacy" by subordinatmg my love. through penetration?

When I bought my very first “strapwn” (67 dollars and
difficult to use), I told my gay male friend about it, thinking
he wouldn't impose any of his moral beliefs or principles
on me. But instead of sparking an awkward conversation, it
became a debate. He assumed that since I was gay, I must
be a feminist, too. i think my response went something like,
“Umm, no amigol It doesn’t woik that way. Who the hell
told you I am a feminist? And stop using the word lesbian."
His argument was that since lesbians reject the penis, they
must be feminists, and therefore the simple act of buying
and using the “strap—on"only gave him “supportive evidence”
to question my sexual identity and think ofmy “lesbian sex"
as “bisexual sex,"

So this is to you, amigo. First ofall, not all lesbians are
feminist, and not all feminists are lesbians. However, the
term “political lesbian,” which nowadays seems to be used
interchangeably with the term “lesbian," comes from the
early 1970s. And, according to Cheryl Clarke, a “political
lesbian" is someone who uses “lesbianism as an act of resis-
tance" by “embracing lesbianism as an ideological, political
and philosophical means of liberation of all women from
heterosexual tyranny." Any woman could be a “political les-

other woman in order to identify herself as such.

This blur in the boundary line between gender opprCSr
sion and sexual orientation seems to inﬂuence “the lesbian
bed"by restricting sexual exploration forwomcn.It also rein-
forces stereotypes that “real
lesbians" do not use dildos
or “strapsons” since they
want to get rid of any trace
of the male masculine opr
ptessor in their lives and in
the bed. My
amigo's [5'
action came
from this tendency of not separating gender
issues and sexual orientation, so he asked me
things like, “Why would you want an object
shaped as a penis to penetrate your lover
and you? I thought you didn’t like penises.
Why have a dildo when you can have the real
thing? Plus] thought that the whole point of
being a lesbian is to get away from the penis
because it’s ‘repulsive’f

In order to understand why lesbians, in-
cluding myself, may use dildos or “strap-OHS"
to have sex, we need to explore the concept
of sex from a gender perspective, a religious
perspective and a historical context. so what
is sex and, most impoitrtntiy, why do we have
sex? Is it simply a necessary act to reproduce? If that's it,
then I guess 1 have never had sex. In women's history, sex for
pleasure is a recent theory and practice. During the second
wave offeminism, and along with the distribution and avail»
ability of “the pill," the definition of sex and its purposes
changed from being a “duty" to being an act ofsexual liberas
tion.

This is why most lesbians have sex—to give and receive
sexual pleasure. Now, sexual pleasure comes in different

shapes, form and colors. Everyone’s body reacts differently
and our sexual fantasies are not attached to a sexual orienta—
tion label. Try thinking of penetration as not being depen-
dent on the penis, and try to isolate the physical pleasure
from a masculine perception otpower. Although I agree that
penetration involves role»playing and power, I do not think
ofit as a simple subordination act between a “ masculine opt
pressor" and a "female oppressee". While there is a different
pleasure that involves power of masculinity when penetrat-
ing, there is also the pleasure ofgiving someone consent to
penetrate you. This power comes from not being in control
of your body's reaction and pleasure for a
moment. So usually when lesbians have sex
with penetration, we usually do not think of
the dildo as a penis imitator, but only as an
object that will stimulate sexual pleasure.
“Lesbian sex" usually has nothing to do
with the penis. one of the reasons’why the
dildo is shaped the way it is, is because that's
a natural shape for pcnetration'of the female
body. Not all dildos look like penisesithe '
goal is not to have it look like what is “missr
mg" in “lesbian sex,“ but to explore sexual
pleasure. Most of the lesbians I know are
indifferent about penises. It's not the penis,
but the combination ofso many more aspects
that make up a man, that does not sexually or
emotionally attract lesbians to males.

I am not saying that I am an expert on sex,
but I do know my body and what satisfies me doesn't neces-
sarily have to satisfy every lesbian. Penetration is not always
part of sex, whomever it is between. In other words, sex is
what rocks your boat. Whatever it is, sexual a'cts between
lesbian and heterosexual couples can be similai—it’s just the
instruments, exploration level and gender that changes. Evt
crytliing that can be done in a “lesbian bed" can be done in a
“heterosexual bed," too, and vice Versa.

As a GrinneLlian I have become increas—

A critique of SGA films choices

The SGA films this weekend are “Drag
Me to Heu, " ’Roscmary’s Baby, 'the 2007 Rob
Zombie remake of“Hal.loween"~or you could
watch "Jaws" in an inner tube at the pool [or
night. Chances are you never heard about the
Asian horror fest (organized by AAA) that I
covered in the arts section. Like the multitude
of foreign films screened by various campus
groups in settings more modest than Harris
over the years, the attention given to the her
ror fest this week pales in comparison to the

monolithic presence ofSGA ﬁlms on campus.

This is not to say mat SGA isn’t some-
what entitled to its status as the main source
for films—it is the student group that wields
the largest budget devoted to all things movies,
after all. However, like so many things in the
world, it’s not a question of much but how you
use it. For the past couple years, SGA ﬁlms has
failed to account for the diversity of multicul-
tural tastes and voices on campus, so that the
semester schedule is once again packed from
start to finish with ﬁlms made by white (usual-
ly American) men—movies that you probably
could have accessed at your local eineplex or
on TNT. In fact, on this semester’s schedule or
SGA films, only one was directed by a woman
(“Bifgand perhaps not the finest example of
feminist cinema) and only two were directed
by nonrwhrte men (“The Code,” which was
actually a Cultural Films Committee pick, and
“Ponyo").

This is a travesty. Halloween is an espe»
cially appropriate time for delving into more
global ﬁlm canons. In addition to the thriving
horror ﬁlm cultures in Asian countries from
Thailand to Japan to Malaysia, countries like
Mexico, Italy and Iran boast impressive horr

rot film industries. Even if we stay in Hol-
lywood there’s the question of gender—is it
fair to show Rob Zombie‘s banal recycled vets
sion of “Halloween" when so few us of have
seen Kathryn Bigelow’s vampire classic “Near
Dark”? Don’t get me wrong—"Drag Me to
Hell” and “Rosemary’s Baby" are as marvelous
as "Halloween" 's terrible, but there’s some-
thing to be said for the pleasures offered by
other industries’horror ﬁlms that you just can’t

get from the old Hollywood book ofscares.
Next semester's SGA ﬁlms schedule is all
kinds of wide open right now, and I encourr
age you to make suggestions to the films chair
thatwill shake up the old white guy schedule.
As AAA officer Ivy Lee observes, “it would
be nice if there were some kind of alternative
offered that didn’t have who in a designated
‘Xrerhnieity film week’, to be forgotten by the
next weekend.”We go to a liberal arts school
where we like to deﬁne our tastes as eclectic
and our minds as open. This means treating
Harris not just as a secondrrun theater for
formulaic Hollywood leftovers, but as an op-
portunity for discovering the cinematic glories
that never put a dime in Michael Bay's pocket.
