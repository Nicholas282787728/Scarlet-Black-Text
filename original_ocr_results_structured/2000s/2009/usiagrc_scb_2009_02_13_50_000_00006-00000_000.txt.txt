Profs show off favorite flicks in new series

uvMarutJapmca

VVitll ”Better Know Your Professors," SGA Films and
Theresa Geller, English, have combined to present an oppor»
tunity to see a less academically intense side of revered profes—
sors outside the classroom The thlccﬂvctk series, featuring
Erik Simpson, English, Victoria Brown, History, and Gellet, is
Gellers latest idea to inspire more intelligent discusstan ofﬁlm
among both faculty and students The bigger problem, though,
might be getting Grinnell students to tilte advantage of that
opportunitv tnd slmw up.

As a rule, Wednesday night attendance IS plettylow,”SGA
Films Director loti‘ Slnlck 09 said referencing past events.

Attendance followed lackluster form fol Wednesday night’s
opener, rvherc Simpson discussed Trot/log Plates, the 1933 roles
reversal comedy starring Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykloyd.
What was initially designed as an interview between Simpson
and Courtney Sllcchan ’10 became more ofa small group dis
cussion with flcrﬂowlng conversation.

srnrpson focused in part on how Trading PM”: srrcceeds
because ofits traditional structure. “It’s a fantastic movie about
what it takes to be successful in a comedy/die said. “One, know
how to be funny, and two, have the right sexual desires," The
main characters get it right while the bad guys “laugh at the
wrong things and show no sexual desires."

The racial angle in the swap between Murphy and Aykl oyd
adds another layer to the ﬁlmiwell, for most characters. “If
you want to look at how characters negotiate raee, watch every
one but Eddie Murphy,” Simpson said, citing Murphy’s ability
to get away with anything, the use ofthe Billie Holliday song
“Strange Fruit" and the racial overtones of shipping a group of
gorillas back to Africa.

But the conversation‘s focus went beyond Trading Plum
talk (one need not have seen the movie to enjoy the discussion).
By the end, the group had covered To Win, Deadwood, realism
in frlrn, commentary tracks (notably in T/lir Ir Spur/ll Tap), one
notated novels, and graphic novels.

The ﬁlm series will continue for two more weeks, with
Brown presenting the 1987 ﬂick/Idvmlurcr In Bribyll't/ilzg next
Wednesday and Geller showing the Chinese frlm Ashci lfTilm'
Rtrllix the week after. The discussion begins at 6:30 pm. in

While Gcllcl"s SClCCllon is a bit more obscure, professors
were given no guidelines when picking their favorites.

“[Thc film] doesrrt represent you as an academic, it repre-
sents you as a person," Geller said.

Brown hopes to have some fun discussing Adam/um in
BabyliI/irlg, one of the many classic cornrngrofrage teen romps
to emerge from the 80's. “I was being a little silly and a little
perverse, but then 1 had a couple offaculty come up to me and
say it was a really important movie to them, too." she said.

“It takes the role ofthc babysitter and makes her competent
and clever," Brown said. “It's a pseudo-mother who's very brave
and very creative in getting children out ofthe mess tliey'ic in."

Gardner meets its match

If past live performances are any indication, tonight's con~
cert by hardcore punk hand Fucked Up might cause things to
get, well, fuelted up. In an appearance on lWTVLiw (Canada),
playing in the men's bathroom, the band tore through ceiling
tiles with microphone stands and eventually triggered a stamr
pede ofmoshing fans. At last springs South by Southwest {as
tival in Austin the hand incited a near-riot when they played
on top ofa bridge.

Thankfully, the band‘s music matches their antics. Since
they began releasing frrll albrrms in 2006, they have slowly
gained a following among the radio community. Last year’s
C/mvrrmy o/(Jonmmn Ly: showed up on many yearrentl 115157
tor good reason.

Fucked Up manages to remain true to their hardcore roots
while expanding beyond the simple three-cord structure. The
openrng tiack,“Sons ofLit’e,”star ts with a ﬂute, but gets pushed
out by raging guitar rrffs and lead singer Damian “Pink Eyes"
Abraham's grurrvoict. Even when therr sound sticks closer to
their roots, they change the formula again by layering gurtars
on top ofone another,

But live performances truly deﬁne the band. Abraham

Gardner

alone puts on an amazing shOW7the 300 hundred pound
frontman can start a mosh pit like no other, and his nickname,
“Pink Eycs,”was earned because of the blood rtrnning down his
face due to self-inﬂicted injuries during shows,

The energy of the test of the band—while not quite as
strong Abraham's—turns shows into a frenetic night of de—
struction.

So even ifyou tlon’t worship at the altar ofHenry Rollins or
frequent the hardcore scene, stop by Gardner tonrght to cheek
our one of the best and most anarchic shows ofthe year.
