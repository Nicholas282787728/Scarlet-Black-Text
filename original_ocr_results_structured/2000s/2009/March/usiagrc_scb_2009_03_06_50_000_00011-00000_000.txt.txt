Grinnellians favor service over booze and bikinis in Cancun

With new All Break trip options, more students can Spend their spring break helping communities around the country

By SARAH BLACK

This spring Break, 37 studenrs will devote
their time away from class and a minimal fee to
go on service trips around the country in four
studentscoortliuared programs. Comprising a
range of projects and locations, the Alternative
Break program inns to move students from
the classroom to llalld$ron service programs
for two weeks in the middle ofthe semester.

Though fewer participant applications
were submirred this year and one more rrip
was offered, trip coordinator Matt Zmudka ’11
said that the groups are invested in all things
Alt Break, “Every trip had enough applicants
rhar rhey were able ro pick a pool proven in
presEreak mcerings to be really committed
ro whar Alt Break moansidoiug service over
break, living simply," zinudka said.

Expanding the program relies on srudenr
interest in developing projects, “The more
trips there are, the more people will apply,"
zmudka said. “The program will stay strong if
it has strong tripsr"

Past Alt Breaks have included a range
of causes. “There was a group last year that
worked with veterans' issues," Ztnudka said.
“Native American issues, poverty, homeless-
ness, education, healrh care, trails— rhese are
all things thatAlt Break is really well-equipped
to serve ifpeoplejust have the ideas"

This break, Zmudka and Hannah Sagin
'11 will lead nine other volunteers to Potosi,
Missouri to rebuild a two—mile stretch of the
Ozark Trail Association‘s ZOO—mile trail net-
work, which was destroyed when rhe Taum
Sank dam collapsed in zoos.

Alisha Saville ’09 and Michelle Fournier
’09 are coordinating a similarly environmch
tally focused Alt Break sending ten students
to build trails in national and state parks near
Bethesda, California. “It can be a really be an
intense experience for some people, in terms
ofbeiug an intentional community and always
being around the same people 24/ 7 for two
weeks," Saville said, “But at the same time I

feel like it's rhe program where many of the
closesr friendships are forged,"

This springs only indoor Alt Break will be
lead by Mitcacla Holmes '10 and Jordan Air
lison '09 working wirh urban poverty in St.
Louis, Mtssouri.Thc scvcn parricipanrs‘worke
load will include building a preschool play
ground, volunreering with the Red Cross and
food banks, and helping to facilirarc the annual
CANstmction compotirion, which challenges
St, Louis engineers and architects to build
elaborate structures out ofdouated food.

The project came together largely wirh the
help of David IVIolho ’82,who Holmes said rc-
sponded to the coordinators “mass c-mailing"
St. Louis alumni in the fall. Mollie connected
the coordinators with volunteer opportunities,
an affordable food source, and the “swanky
high school" where the group will sray.

Holmes hopes that the trip will change
participants’ perception of their community.
“The town of Grinnell has a thirty percent
poverty rare, bur around the campus you don’t
see that," Holmes said. “So going to St. Louis
to look at their issues with poverty wtll help
us hopefully become more aware ofpoverty in
our own area,"

After participating in their first Alt Break,
many students continue to be active in service
participating in future Alt Breaks. Jacques
Nguyen ’10, who has participated in Alt Break
every year ofhis college career. “[It] was minds
expanding,"Ngaiyen said. “it really brings you
back to rhc humanirarian aspect of education.
It’s so humbling."

Ngaiyen and Eric Skelnik ’09 are leading
a nine-student Alt Break to Mammoth Cave
National Park in Kentucky to focus on con
servation. “I found that rhc best way for people
to be conscious about this is to be physically
and actively participating in something with a
goal,” Nguyen said.

Organizing this trip while he was abroad
last semester proved more stressful than Coors
dinating a similar environmental trip to Write

sou. California last year. “I wish I had known
the deadline earlier so I could have put in
more effort. looked for more detailed things,”
Nguyen said,

Another problem, according to Nguyen, is
thar srudenrs apply based on location instead
ofconcernr‘one thing that’s really discourage
ing to me is when applicants apply to a trip
specifically for the location," Nguyen said.
“Apply because of rhe issues you’re interested
in.That’s going to be rhe deciding factor, whar
you're passionate about."

The ReNew Orleans program began as an
Alternative Break project three years ago bur
saw such an increase in applications and fund-
ing that the program became an independent
student group.

According to ReNew coordinator Zach
Schult—r’lo, this year’s group of14 participants,

selected from an applicant pool of around 30,
is relatively small. “It’s the smallest group we've
ever taken because we didn’t have enough room
down there to work,” Schultz said. “It’s Spring
Break right now and a lot ofvolunteers are go-
ing down there."

Progress in New Orleans’ reconstruction
has shifted the program’s focus, “Last year it
was completely gutting houses and tearing
down houses," Schultz said. “Now it's all res
building and cleaning up, You get to see the
families more now because they're raking con-
trol over how it's going to be rebuilt."

The group will spend the first week of
Spring Break aiding Hurricane Ike relief ef-
forts in Galveston, TX before working with
the Episcopal Diocese ofLouisiana, primarily
through alumni in the organization.

SGA takes over the radio, broadcasts news, ramblings

iw Mititcus ZEITZ

In an effort to make SGA news available to the masses,
Peter Henry '09, SGA Concerts Chair, has
embarked upon a mission to master rhe mr‘
waves, so to speak.

“There’s no one perfect way ro reach

people on campus, so i figured it couldn'r
hurt to cover every medium," Henry said.

The idea of an SGA radio show
originated with Jan Koszewski ‘08,
who pioneered the concept last year.
This year, Henry, along with Josef
Schneider '09, SGA Administrative
Coordinator, have revived Koszewski’s
project with a new format.

The show, which runs from 10 a.m. to 12 pm. every Fri—
day on KDIC 88.5 FM, has aired twice since the start ofthe

semester. It features a mix of news, music, humor, and discus
'sion.
Specifically, the radio show will relay SGA
information to the student body following
the Joint Board meeting on Wednesday ev s
ning, “I hope it will improve our tritnspilr
eney." Schneider sairl.

Henry also hopes to faster better relas
rions between students and admins
isrration. “I’d like to get Houston
Dougharty [Vice President of SUP
dent Affairs] in here just to talk," he

said,

Last week, Henry and Schneider intcre

viewed SGA executive candidates on the air,

providing an informal forum for discussion of campaign is-
sues.

Henry described it as “a news ralk show—if we pretend
that Grinnell is the real world."

In addition to sharing and discussing news stories, Henry
plans to use the show to play music from upcoming concerts.
“We want to make it interesting to listen to,” Schneider said.

one issue the radio show faces is exposure. In a sampling
ofsrudents in rhe Spencer Grill and Lyle’s Pub, only a few had
even heard of the program.

“It sounds deathly boring,” said Thomas Bateman '10.
Upon further explanation, his opinion ofthe show improved,
although he was doubted its feasibility. “That sounds really
worthwhile, but I don't really listen to radio," Bateman said,
reflecting a common view among those inrerviewed.

Others took issue with the time slot, such as AnnasLisa
Bowans ’12. “A problem mighr be having classes from ren to
noon," Bowans said. “It would be better if it were some sort
of podcasr."
