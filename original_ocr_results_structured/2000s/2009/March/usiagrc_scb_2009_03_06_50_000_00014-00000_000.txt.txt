Response from Res dence Life

Las week, the SSE wrote a staff edimt
rial crlt Zing the choice of James as the new
substancetfrce dorm. As members ofthc Rest
idence Life Committee, we wish ro address
some ofthe inaccuracies in the editorial.

The editorial cited a lack ofsrudent input,
However, our of all the decisions the adminiSt
tratlon has made this year, rhe designarion ofa
new substillicetfree hall had the most student
input, First, the Residence Life Committee is
a majority student committee and includes at
least two senators and thc VPSA as members,
Besides gaining representation through elected
officials, the commirree further asked for stur
dent opinion at several Joint Board meetings
and senators sent emails asking for student in-
put. Not stopping there. we set up an unofﬁt
cial survey on P»Wel) asking the student body
their opinions. Additionally, individual email
surveys were sent to current ripper-class stu-
dents who drew into substancetfree housing
and current first year students who requested
substanccrfrcc housing, but instead were “chisr
tered" in nonrsubsmnCthrec halls, Moreover,
messages posted on F-Web, cmails received by
the Residence Life Ofﬁce, and student at large
feedback was reviewed and discussed during
the weekly Residence Life Committee meet»
ings.

Based on opinion gathered from the ALL
substancefree surveys, we found rhe editor
rial's concerns about current substancetfree
students unwillingness to draw into South
Campus to be unfounded. Furthermore, We
found the opposite to be true—many current
substancetfree residents said that even though
they wished to live in substancetfree housing,
they would not draw into Norris and would
choose an alternate (nonesuhstancetfree) hall,

Due to the need for first-year and sophOr
more rooms, the only options that could ac-
commodate the excess substance-free demand
were adding Main, Cleveland, or james OR
moving the North Campus substanCEtfree hall
from Smith to Norris. The editorial suggests
tlrar the larrer was the best option, However,
the committee decided to remove Norris as an
opriun due to lack of student interest. Smt
dents across the board were not willing to lose
Smith in order to add Norris. Students also
felt very strongly that by using the furthest
dorm on North Campus, we were trying to

“separate” substancetfree students from the *

rest of campus. Choosing Norris would send
a message that the campus wants to push the
snbsrance—free snidents as far away from the
main part of campus as possible lnro a dorm
with a reputation for being one of the least
popular. Forinstanee, what message would the
admi rrarion have sent ifit decided to only
have gender‘ncutral housing in Norris?

Thus, the committee decided to crease
student choice in subsrance-free housing by
returning substance-free housing to South
Campus (Read was the ﬁrst substancc~frce
dorm) The editorial opposes this parity by
pointing to the lack ofair conditioning in sen
eral dorms. However, air conditioning Is not
added to more dorms because of the prohibit

tive costs involved with retrofitting the older
dorms. Just because complete parity cannot be
achieved does not mean ir should be ignored,

After deciding to include a substance-free
option on South campus, the committee and
administration had to make a difficult decision
and determine which residence hall would her
come substance-free. James meets first and
secondtyear student (substance-free) need but
may not meet uppertclass need because there
is only one single room, Cleveland aild Main
offered more single room options to upper
class students but posed their own challenges.
Gardner Lounge is locarcd in Main, which
made Main a poor choice for sllbstancerfrcc
For Cleveland, we determined it could be
thoroughly cleaned by hiring a smoke removal
cleaning service. Even rhough Cleveland has
consistenrly been the last hall to ﬁll during
room draw, it was made very clear to the Rcs
Life Committee there was little of no student
support for Cleveland becoming substance-
free.

In the end, the best choice was to designate
james as the new substance-free hall. There is
a continual and increasing need for firsr and
second year subsrance-free housing/spaces
Substancetfree clustering simply does not
work. In order to meet substancetfree student
demand AND recognize and appreciate the
voice ofstudenrs currently on campusi ames
was the clear choice.

Course schedule printed copy

First of all,I fully support giving students
the option to not receive a printed copy ofthc
course schedule. I also fully support making
distribution ofthe printed schedule an opt-in
option. What pushes my buttons in the mor-
ally righteous rhetoric with which I was bomt
barded when I chose to get a printed copy of
the course schedule, NowI would normally let
such a minor annoyance pass, bur it highlights
what I believe to be wrong with the modern
environmentalist movement.

Besides the subject line, there’s nothing
wrong with the email, The subject line reads
“"IUST SAY NO to the Printed Schedule of
Courscsfln trying to mimic what is considered
by many (though not, ironically, Grinnellians)
universal morality regarding drugs, the subject
completely misstares the email’s message.The
opt—in program means every student, by de-
fault, has said no what they mean is “JUST
DON’T SAYYES,"whlch is a less catchy mes
sage, But the email itself simply informs me
that ifl want a printed schedule this semester,
I must alert them via Pioneer Web, Fine.

But in telling me how to opt in, they gave
me rather cryptic directions. “Look for the
green frog", What does that mean? This was
my first clue that for whatever reason, they
didn't want me to give a printed schedule. But
I found the green frog withour too much trou-
ble, and clicked the "opt in"link next to it The
clrolces were somerhing like the following.

“Yes: I have realized that the online schedt
tiling tools are sufllcient for my needs."

“I\ . The online scheduling tools are not
sufﬁcient for my needs and I would like to re-
ceive a printed copy ofthe course schedule"

There was a lot more morally righteous
rhetoric on this page that i cannot remember
off the top of my head. But by switching what
any normal person would consider to be the
logical definitions of“ycs" and “no" (remember
I've already said I’m trying to opt in to get the
printed version) this is completely misleading.
But being the thoughtful person i try to be.l
actually read the descriptions and thus chose
“No"... meaning that yes, I wanted a printed
schedule

And then I was redirected to a page with a
picnire ofa sad panda srrring on a tree stump,
with the message "Colin, rrtchuggcr panda is
still having a sad."

Where. oh where, to begin.

I’ll make the assumption (which is probably
wrong) that the point ofsetting up this process
was in fact to help the environment and nor, as
I suspect, to save rhe College money.

The designer of this process is not only as
surning that there exists absolute moral right
and wrong, but that they know, at least in this
case, which is which! This is an all too com—
mon and extremely dangerous mindset, and it
is the primary mindset of the environmentab
ist movement. An environmentalist might say,
but it is universall Science tells us that we are
the cause ofglobal warming, and science tells
us what terrible things global warming will do,
so isn't it our duty to attempt to reverse or limit
this process.> Isn't that the right thing to do?

Science can tell us the cause, science can
tell us the effect. Science can never tell us
right and wrong. There is not universal prin-
ciple of “better" or “worse", we cannot say that
the world after global warming would be any
worse than the world before lLW: can say that
many species, including ourselves, would go
extinct. But we can't say that's any worse

But, the environmentalist argues, a situa-
tion in which we are extinct is certainly worse
than a situation in which we are alive? Not int
trinsically, That sort of “worse" is universal in
a sense: (almost) all humans, motivated by the
search for happiness, can agree on it. This is
the langiage in which modern environmenral-
ism must be rewritten. For not everyone he-
lieves they have a moral responsibility to save
the whales. Not everyone believes they have a
moral responsibility to humanity as a whole
But everyone seeks happiness, and in order ro
continue that journey rherc are steps humanity
as a whole must take to ensure that we do not
destroy our habitat.

So no one can tell me that I was right or
wrong in choosing to get a print schedule. And
the attempt to make me feel guilty only ticks
me off, and makes me feel (through an all too
human, emotional reaction) like doing the op-
posite of what I'm clearly “supposed” to do.

There’s no debating with the morally [lghT
teens, The best you can do is ignore them,
ignoring environmentalism would have danr
gerous consequences, so I rruly hope rhe en-
viroiunenralisr movement recognizes rhe real
reason to save rhe planetTo save ourselves.
