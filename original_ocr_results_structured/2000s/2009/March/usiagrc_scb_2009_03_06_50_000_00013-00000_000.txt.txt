Longer campaign period and dormsloverr break

Candidate campaign time

For the last week, presidential and
vice presidential candidates for SGA
have plastered the campus vith ﬂiers
and gone doorttotdoor soliciting votes
from fellow students. Despite the clear
effort put forth by these students, the
short campaigning period hampers the
possibilities for substantive differences
to clncrgi: between candidates

Currently, candidates for SGA Ex~
ccutivc posin'ons have only onc week
to formally apply whcrhcr or not ro
run and then only one week to actually
campaign. This is insufficient. Election
Board should extend both the applicac
tion window and, even more impor-
tantly, tho campaigning period.

With only a weak to campaign
the main way students learn about the
candidates is through brief bathroom
readers and loggia posters oftcn fea-
turing merely n candidate’s nnnrc and
a photo ripped from Facebook. These
are too frequently low on content and
high on gimmicks such as unreason-
able promiscs to refotm the dining hall.
Crunched for time, it's understandable
that candidates resort to these tactics
as they must perform publicity triage,

allocating their resources to simply get
their name out to all of campus rather
than engage in meaningful debatcr

- The open forum scheduled during
the campaign week could scrvc as good
venues to highlight policy difforcnces
between the candidates but coming
only two days After the campaign has
gins, it affords candidates little time to
prepare. With such a short window to
publicize cvcnrs, studcnts at large also
have little dine to research the issues or
the candidates but, further, might not
even be aware of the fact that an elec-
tion is at hand. '

What cmcrgcs are overly vague
and homogenons campaign statements
with each candidate touting similar
qualiﬁcations and pushing ambiguous
claims to increase communication and
transparency.

A longer campaign would grant
both candidates and students more time
to research and deﬁne their platforms.
Ifthe election cycle were extended to
two or three wccks, multiple public {07
turns could be held allowing candidates
to further differentiate themselves from
one another. _

One derivative beneﬁt of all of this

could include an scar-u debate between

all candidates in which they are forced
to defend and evaluate their own poliv
cies and those of their opponents. A
frvc-rninurc sounrl byte at r poorly no
tended open forum is insufﬁcient to
distinguish between candidates,

These increased differences could
be furthered through cnhnnccd covcc
ngc in open forums such is 1(ch und
thc stab. With only n wcck-long cam-
paign, we at the SEE don‘t have time
to fully investigate and report on the
candidates and “
their issues. A "
longer r-unr
pnign rlrner _
frame would
allow us to ﬁll?
ther differen
ate the candi—
dares with our
own reporting supplementing the dc»
bntc and open forum.

This is not an indictment on the
quality of the candidates and their
campaigns The current system con-
strains their ability to create and clearly
cxpross choir idcns.

Spring Break: dorms open
Spring break ofrcn brings visions

of warmer weather, road trips, or just a
much needed breather after a stressful
midsems wcck. But for many Grin-
ncllians~intcmutionol students, csptr
cially~who can’tjustify the cost or the
time it would take to make a trip home,
spring break means frantically trying to
frgurc out how to spend two wccks off
campus once the dorms close on Satur»
day afternoon

This your will be different. We apt
plaud the administration for keeping

the dorms

' open during

spring brcuk

While stu-

dents will not

have access

to the dining

hall or the

health cen-

rcr and might ﬁnd themselves in the

middle of an extensive FM project, just

having the option to stay on campus is
a necessary change.

After the move to open dorms early
after winter break, this is also a wel—
come sign that students’ travel needs
will continue to play an impo ant role
in shnping administrative decisions.
