dent local foods rntemshrp represents the culmina-
tion or months of commitment and compromrse
by students and staﬁlonking ro rcconnectuirh the
systems behind the things rhey ear,

The garden by Lake Nyanza in Miller Park
located about a mile south ofcampus,will combine
the aliens of volunteers from both the town and
College to grow trash produce. Accord g to orgar
niverCairlin Vaughan'io, dac program aims to “get
more fresh foods onro plates in Grinuell and pro-
vide die community with free access to food and
gudens in peoples backyards"

Eric Nost ’09 said that rhc project aims to
“spark discussion on food policy and bring back
gardening to everyday life."

In addiu‘on to the Lake Nyanza garden, or
garners hope to use rhc project's Sarah Boyer ’08
Community service Fellowship, a summer grant
given to a student each year, to provide potted
tomato plants for gardening enthusinsu living in
ripamncnts.Thc program is largel armed at “people
who would like to trearc gardens but may not be
able to our targcr audience is the disadvantaged
and physically handicapped," Nost said. Regular
coo outs are also planned throughout the summer
to hang community members together and feature
arnr-iery orlocal foods,

The gardens student developers rrlicd on sup
port from the cornmimity, including the Grinncll
Parks and Recreation Depamnent which donarcd
the land for the garden, and volunteers from die
Mayﬂower Renrcmonr Home, who \hrrghan said
have hocn eager to share Llicir grudmung expertise
along with rhe workload “They are so crcired for
rlus proiect and hare been grcar widr helping us
pickweetis,”shesard.

Local foods urreru Neal Weplong ‘10 called
one project “an attempt to change [food] culture
More people are looking back at gardening wirh
the economy the way it is ”

The goal of a community vegetable plot be-
gan coming together last summer while Nost and
a group of three odaer students worked with the
family-oriented nonproﬁt Mld‘lowa Community
Action, inc. using a Peace Grant to ﬁnd a numher

rhe previous summer's volunteer connecuons and

grams iue “focused on directly engaging people,
This rs more ambitious, but also more rewarding."

After a year of planning. Dining services ap
pointed chking to die new position oflocill foods
intenr.weplang described his dun-cs as “radiiraring
communication herwccn local tar-ms and rho dinr
ing hall and hclping organize the dining hall to
buy more local food." Wepkrng will serve for rhe
remainder oftlic season and hcgin training a new
intern um winter.

“Neal is meeting wirh people, working on
growing relationships, asking morn what drey're
plarrnng and what they’re wriirng to grow for us in
die arnrrc," said Assistant Director ofDlning ser
vices Terry \Valrcrsdort The job requires negotiatr
ing a practical business model wirh local farmers,
not all otwhorn “are willing to grow wholesale and
want two to drree u'rnes what were paying, which
is not pracrical when you're feeding 1,000 people,"
he said.

Waltersdortsaid that he helreves rhe internship
“is going to end up growrng the purchase oflocal
foods, which we were already doing, and make the
purchccs more local" man rhe 7srmile radius mat
Drning Services uses to categorize foods as local.

Dining Seniors is currently arranging a meal
new fall thatwill feature as many local foods as pos-
srhle and bring farmers onto campus for the pnmar
ry goal ot'gcning food and producers and students
togetlier,"Wzltetsdoi-fsaid.

VVepking comes to the positron with a litetime
ofctperience. ”I grew up on a turn and worked on
an mncrrciry garden lasr summer,” he said. Last
year he participated in Think Global, Eat Local,
an independenr srudy course instructed by Profey
tor ion Adelson '70 Anthropology, Dirccror otrhe

and cmironmcneal prinuples behind the local food
movement.

ihrorrgh the course,Wepking developed con-
tacts with local farmers Andy Dunham otGrrnnell
Heritage Farms and Bud Donne of North Skunk
sawmrll and Marker rhar he currently dnws upon
for local food pronrremenr. Wepking also aims to

_ esmblish new sources of local foods including hu-

manelyrtreated meat from farmer Barney Bahren-
Edsel

However, Walrcrsdorf admits the dilﬂcul
expanding Grinncll's local food consumprion,
not going to be an orernighr thing—Neal is laying
the groundwork for the future," he said. “We can’t
even get asparagus our ofthe ground this year
