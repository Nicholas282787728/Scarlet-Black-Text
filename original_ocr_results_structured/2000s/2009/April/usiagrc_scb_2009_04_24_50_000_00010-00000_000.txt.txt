It’s about time to use those deIUX campus grills

There comes a time every semester when you realize that
youjust can't take the dining hall anymore. Maybe you’re start
ing at your plate of pasta with white clam sauce when it hits
you—Iowa is landlocked. Maybe your chicken cacciatore tastes
more like cardboard cacciatore. Maybe your last ten meals have
been CinnamonToast Crunch and French fries. Whatever the
case, you need an escape, and you’ve already been to Chuong
Garden and Lonnski's enough.

one of the best parts about
nice weather is the chance to grill
food outside. lfyou’rc a vegetar-
inn, skip down a few paragritphs,
If not: steakl As a college student,
you probably can’t afford to buy a
ribeye or tenderloin, but look for
ﬂank steak and top sirloin instead. Tougher cuts or meat, like
flank and top sirloin, taste better lfmarlnﬂted ﬁrst. To marinate
steak, combine 1/2 cup soy sauee,2 tablespoons Dijon mustard,
3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce, and 1 tablespoon garlic
powder in a plastic Ziploc bag, then add the piece ofsteak and
seal. Refrigerate {or at least an hour before grilling.

You' re the director of your future.

When you're ready to cook, load one of the super-high—tech
grills around campus with charcoal and light the coals. The
coals should be ashy and white before you start cooking. While
the coals heat. oil the grate with a paper towel dipped in vcge
etable oil. Lay the steaks on the grill. Cooking time varies
depending on the thickness ofyour steak, Ifit’s an inch thick,
you’ll want to cook it 4-5 minutes on each side for rat: (9,
10 minutes total) or 6-7 minutes
on each side for medium (12714
minutes total) lfit’s 1 1/2 inches
thick, cook it 577 minutes on each
side for rare or 8-10 minutes on
each side for medium. Do not cook
your steaks to the point that they're
well done, unless you are some kind
of barbarian.

conventional wisdom says to check to see it steak is done
by pressing down on it—rare should be soft, and medium
should be firm but yield a int If, like most people, you don't
automatically know what “firm butyrclding"means, you can al—
ways check by cutting partway into the steak Once your steak

is ready, let it rest for a few minutes before eating. A1 sauce
helps iryou've bought a really cheap cut of meat.

Vegetariansvand people who appreciate vegetables with
their hunk ofmeatican also take part in the grilling festivities.
A grill pan, or a pan with a bunch ofholes in the bottom. works
best, but you can create your own by layering several sheets of
tin foil and punching pencilrsized holes in the bottom. Vegetrr
blcs should be cleaned, lightly oiled, and sprinkled with a little
sltlt. Excellent choices for grilling: mushrooms, onion quarters
or small onions, quartered bell peppers, cherry tomatoes, halved
large tomatoes Vegetables may be easier to handle rfyou skew
or them so they don't roll away. Mushrooms take the longest
to cook, up to 20 minutes depending on the size, while cherry
tomatoes can take as little as 10 minutes. onions and peppers
take closer to 1445 minutes, but will be okay ifyo‘u cook them
for a little extra time.

Suggested desserts: ice cream or grilled peaches. Or both.
Clean and oil the grill very well, and then place fresh peach
halves (pitted) cuteside down and cook for 3 minutes. Flip,
cook for another 3 minutes,nnd serve sprinkled with cinnamon
and brown sugar.
