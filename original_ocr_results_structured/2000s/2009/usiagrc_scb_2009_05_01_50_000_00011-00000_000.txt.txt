THIRD FLOOR BALCONY

Did you know that there are not one, not two, but three
balconies in the JRCPThe third ﬂoor balcony is a railedsoff
space that covers a small portion of the roof on the north side
of the building, overlooking Mac Field. It is accessible from
the hallway adjacent to the StudenrAlfaus Ofﬁce, the one
that leads to the Voiceboit and Student Work Room.Although
the balcony was part of the building’s original plan, it remains
locked and unused because ofits poor design, according to Mi-
chael Sims.“It's a small space, and it gives easy access to the roof
ofthe entire building," said Sims, Director ofcampus Center
operations and Student Activities. "We just don't want kids
running around up there because of the potential to fall off."

VOIC EBOX
STUDENT ORGANIZATION WORRROOM

lfyou’re not very involved in any student organizations or have
never had to make posters to hang outside of the dining hall,
then you‘re probably not familiar with the Voicebox and the
student organization rooms on the third ﬂoor, The Voicebox is
a general ofﬁce for student groups to work in, and is directly ads
jacent to the Work Room. But did you know that on the other
side ofthc Work Room is the storage room, both ofwhich

have ﬂoorstosce‘lling windows facing the train tracks and East
Campus? The workroom has butcher paper and paint available
for students to make posters.The storage room is half the size
of the Work Room and holds YMCA—like lockers for organiza-
tions' storage space. The Work Room is also used by SGA, and
occasionally hosts meetings.

Ifyou’ve ever taken the elevator to the third ﬂoor, then you
know that all of the ofﬁces and rooms are to the right when you
step out of the elevator. But did you know that ifyou turn left,
there’s a door there that leads to a narrow, L-shaped hallway,
which leads to a stairwrdl? The hallway seems pointless until
you realize that there are ﬁre doors between the elevators and
the rest of the ﬂoor, This allows for a stairway escape in case of
a ﬁre, and ifyou were to ever get stuck behind those fire-doors,

you can use that hallway as a menus to go down the building
without having to use the elevators.

Most of you are probably familiar with Room 2097A on the
second ﬂoor. he a long room adjacent to a balcony, and is where
Joint Board often meets. The room is also occasionally used for
special events and classes. But did you know that Room 209-A
can be split into two rooms? On the ceiling in the middle of the
room, there's a divider that folds down and creates a surprisingly
sound proofwall between the two ends. It can only be operated
with a key, so don’t go in there and press all bunonsinothlng

MULTICULTURAL SUITES

Behind the elevator on the second ﬂoor— the area directly
above the game room and the inailroom — are six suites
complete with a common area and an ofﬁce,Thcse suites are
used primarily by the ofﬁcers of Multicultural Affairs student
organizations,such as CBS (Concerned Black Students). the
AAC (Asian American Coalition), and SOL (Student Organis
zation of Larinos/Latinas).The Stonewall Resource Center was
also located here before it was moved to Younksr Pir last year,
But did you know that also in this area are two industrial sized
kitchens with top of the line equipment? One is the Kosher
Kitchen, which has restricted access and is used only for the
Shabbat dinners. The other is the multicultural kitchen used foi
more general events.

HE OTHER SE 0ND FLOOR LCON

Most likely, all ofyou are familiar with the balcony on the
second floor directly above the main entrance, complete with
tables and chairs, But did you know or have you ever noticed
the narrow balcony thatjets off towards East Campus, the one
that‘s directly above the covered mlkwny up to the mailroom?
According to Michael Sims, that walkway was not part of the
original plan and was added after the faculty requested that
one be put there for the students coming from East and South
Campuses. “The idea was for it to be like a loggia that led you
to the middle ofthc building,"snid Sims.The architects agreed

to the faculty’s request, and decided to make it a balcony by
adding rails to “make it look better."TIie balcony is accessible
through the multicultural suites on the second floor,but is usu-
ally locked.

\IRW ELL

There are a total of five staimells in the JRC. One is between
the ﬁrst and second ﬂoors byJRC 101, two on the east side of
the budding, and two are by the Fireplace Lounge. one of the
stairwells by the Fireplace Lounge leads from the first floor to
the basement, while the other leads from the second ﬂoor to the
courtyard But did you know that one of the stairwells on the
east side of the building doesn‘t allow access into the building
on the ﬁrst ﬂoor, only an exit to the outside?

RDIC RADIO STATION

KDIC' IS located on the second ﬂoor right across from the
publications brace and Dining services ofhees. Most ofyou
have probably noticed the windows of the radio station that
overlooks the dining hall. But did you know that there are
fully equipped performance rooms at the radio station where
bands and artists can perform live on air.> The room can also be
directly connected to the dining halls speaker system, and has
windows that overlook it. Also, the radio station has a storage
room in the basement full of vinyl records.

NOORS AND C RANNIES

Throughout the IRC are little nooks and crannies for people
to work in or hang out. “The idea was to give srudents as many
places to study and relax in as possible," Sims said. “There are all
sorts ofplaccs where you can have a lot ofpeople and hang out
or just curl up in a chair and take a nap.”

Most of the basement is used by Dining Services, and includes
locker rooms for employees as well as a bakery, There are five
pairs of public bathrooms, one on each ﬂoor except for the ﬁrst
ﬂoor, which has two.There are two public elewuors and one
freight elevator used by Dining Services.
