Bansal predicts
‘Yankees in seven’

The Major League Baseball season is long and arduouslhe regular
season is 162 games long, which is about 100 games past my attention
span. However. once the weather in Grinndl mkes a nasty turn, camps
lng out in a lounge to watch some postseason baseball is about as good
as it gets. Or at least it should bhbut this postseason has about as
much drama and cxcitementas little league playoiis.

Sure, the New York Yanken'A-z detest ofrlre Los Angcles Angels
in the American League Championship seats was a closely contested
matchup of two teams with opposite playing styles. However. no series
has gone to seven games in this postseason, and die Yankees opponent
in theWorld Series, the defending champion Philadelphia Phillies, have
steamrolled their way to a Nadonal league Championship. But relief
born the boredom has Comr-WC are now being treated to a World
series in which the dear-cut two best teams in baseball are squaring oh.

I have been wailing six seasons for a World Series to feature two
teams as evenly matched as the Yonkcm and Phillies are this year. Both

these teams

bined to win
three champ'r
onships in the last decade.Funhcl-morc,borh teams are just loaded with
talent, boasting fantastic lineups and solid starting pitching. but the gray
area for both teams lies in their relievers.

The Yankees bullpen saw a lot ofwork this season and put up great
numbers. it features young guns such as joba Chamberlain and Phil
Hughes, and is anchored by Mariano Rivera, possibly the greatest re-
liever ever However, with the Dicepiiorl of“Mo,"rhe issue for the Y“,
kees bullpen is youth and pommson inotpen'errce. No Yankee reliever,
other than Rivera, had more than 3.2 innings of postseason pitching
otperienoe under his belt coming into these 2009 playoffs (Rivera, by
comparison, has pitched 118 postseason innings). And their major
debut hasn’t been very impressive. Both Chamberlain and Hughes
were knocked around by the Angels in the ALCS, and Hughes had
his suuggles with the Minnesom Twins in the divisional round as well.
That being said, the Yankees do have some strength with middle res
licvcrs David Robemon, Phil Coke and Alﬁedo Aceves, all who have
proven they can get the job done.

The Phillies bullpenis mix-and-match to say the least.The strength
ofthe bullpen lies in the two Phillies relievers that can throw top veloc-
ity—Brad Lidge and Ryan Madson. Philly's closer Brad Lidge con-
verted 41 out of41 save opportunities during the Phillies'zoos Chain-
pionship Season. However, Lidgc struggled mightily in 2009, and he
has already blown two saves against the Yankees this seasonihe Phils’
seruprman, Ryan Madson, has been knocked around this postseason,
giving up eight hits and three earned runs in six innings ofwork 'lhe
rrst ofthe Phillies bullpen is as patchyas my facial hairqchad Durbin
has struggled with eontol issues all year, Chan Ho Park has terrible
postseason numbers throughout his long career and Brett Myers is a
failed starter who lacks the velocity to succeed as. a reliever. Considering
mat the Yankees scored more runs from the seventh inning on than any
other team in 2009, Phillies Manager Charlie Manuel should be wary.
The Phillies bullpen is not awﬁll, but this Yankees lineup can chase all
ofthem ifthe hitters stay patient and work are Count.

Overall, die verdict is that the Yankees have the better rclief corp.
The diEerence is that the Phillies pitched to contact and let their out—
smnding defense go to work, while he Yankees just struck people out.
While their s es thus far this postsmson are a concern, the com—
bined talent ofChamberlam and Hughes our of the bullpen is enor-
mous. Lidge and Durbin have begun to step up this postseason, bur
both of these guys endured tough regular seasons and are ticking time

bombs waiting to get shelled by the Yankees.

Volleyball wins last home game

BYMICHAEL SCHOELZ

The Grinnell Women’s Volleyball team beat Knox College
so on Wednesday, ending this season's home games with a re
cord of10~4. After dropping to 4-11 in the beginning ofthe ﬁrst
game, the Pioneers rallied to win 2523 and dominated the Prai—
rie ﬁre for the rest of the night. They won the next two games
25713 and 25714. '

"We have those moments where we have
slow starts but we never lose that notion that
we’re going to vvin,"said Head coach Jackie
Hutchison.

Knox Head Coach Kim Schradcr \ws
impressed with the Pioneers' ability to take
control of the game.

“I felt like Grinnell did a betterjob than
us on recognizing holes on the ﬂoor and
putting the ball in those places and recogr
nizing and changing the tempo the game when it needed to be
changed,” Schrader said. “They forced us to make errors, and
Grinnell always has a great home crowd and that makes it a hose
tile environment."

Wednesday's game was the culmination ora strong season
(13-15) for the Pioneers, who struggled last year to a record of
7e21. Bonnie Kirchner Y12 said that the game against Knox was
“about as good as it gets.”

"Everyone played so well," Kirchner said. “That was one of
the best games that we played all season. Jackie [Hutchison]
has just turned this team around. Last year, we were struggling
against teams like Knox. It's funny, we were watching teams and
I felt like we were watching ourselves a couple years age. lr was
nice this year to beat them."

”It feels good [0 have played a Sea-
son Where / feel like I‘ve reached my
potential and {he Ieam reached its
potential”

“It seems like every bit of [the team] has improved," Hutchi-
son said. “It wasn’t that our best player got better and that‘s
why were winning. It's like the people in the middle, the people
everywhere, and as all of them got better the team got better."

The victory was especially sweet because it was the last home
game ofthe season and the last home game ever for seniors care
oline Bailey '10, Carlie Beach‘lO, Mo Gallo-Chasanoff’lO and
Caitlin Helterline ’10.

“It feels really good to have such a great
group of girls that will be following us up,"
Beach said. “The team is in good hands. It .
feels good to have played a season where I
feel like I’ve reached my potential and the
ream has reached its potential. This year has
been one of the best ears of voll all in
Carlie Beach ’10 my life." , y cyb

The win over Knox, who is in last place
in the MWC standings, ms a crucial one for the Pioneers. In
order to keep their Conference Tournaments hopes alive, the
Pioneers had to beat Knox and now have to wait and hope that
Lawrence University beats Lake Forest College tomorrow.

The Pioneers wrap up their regular season tomorrow in the
non-conference Benedictine University Tourney in Lisle, Ill.
Although conference foe Monmouth will be one of the teams
attending, the pressure to make the conference tournament will
be offthc Pioneers.

"We have four games in less than 24 hours," Beach said.
“We’re pretty excited that it's non—conference so were going to
have n time to let loose and not have to be so focused.”

If the Pioneers do make it to the MWC conference tournae
ment, they will begin play next weekend.

us before we enter the MWC mumament," Sahel said
in an email ”VVartburgis a regionally ranked tearn,and
scoring dirse goals against themwas abigpositive for
us.That's what kept us in the game and thats what
is going to help us win the conference toumamenc”

In order to reach the MWC Tournament for a fourth oonsecutive
year, the Pioneers had to beat the Foresters while dealing with injuries,
suspension and an untested goal keeper. After starter Ben sehemper

’11 was forced to sit out due to a red card in a previous game against
Ripon, and with backrup Greg For '12 suoenng a hip injury, team
manager Nate Hoch ’11 suited up to defend the net. Hoch allowed
one goal and bed seven saves. His performance, when ooupled
with a duo ofgoals by Jusn'n Koester’lo and an additional score
by Andrew Stephenson '10,lod to a H win.

Fox was incredibly impressed by Hoch’s ebut not sun

prised, espetially considering the game ﬁeld’s conditions.
“He is very good at getting balls on the ground, that's one
of his strongest points," Fox said. “Fortunately, that ﬁeld vas
really wet so nobody was hitting great shes, a lot of the show
were right on the ground, so that played right into our llan
U Suffering from a slow start this season, the squad has im
proved signiﬁcantlyas the season progressed, ﬁnishing third in

the regular season MWC standings.
Team Captain and defender JP. Prouty’lO has seen this
team oorne further than any from his years with the Pirr
neers.

“This team has deiirutely grown the most out of any team
[I have been on at Grinnell].We started out the year as a ﬁactioned
ream—we weren't working as a whole," Prouty said. “Throughout the

season we've deﬁnitely ﬁgured out how to play with each other."

Greg For attributes a lot of the squad's development to ream co-
Caprain Andrew Stephensons actions in a midseison game against St.
Nobertin which the Pioneers won 3~1.

”We couldrir reall score goals at the beginning ofthe season, but
against St. Norbert, Stephenson] had the best on-the-ﬁdd leaders
shiﬁusr through play, without yelling and soearning at people,
smcdy leading by example—I’ve ever seen,"Foit said. “I really think
he got us going."

The numbers show a change too, as the Pioneers have scored 10
goals in their past four games while they only managed 14 goals in
their ﬁrst 12 matches.

With the turnaround, the Pioneers have clinched at MWC Tour-
nament berth and a ﬁrst round match against St. Norbert next week-
end. "l'hc Grinnell Men’s Soccer team will end their regular season
against Knox College at 1:30 pm. tomorrow at home on springer
Field Though the MWC Tournament clinched, Head Coach Brian
Jaworsld still wants his team to play like it's the conference roumamenc

“[Jawovnski] is a game-by—game guy, but he's told us to keep the
Conference Tournament in the badt ofour heads," Sahel said. “That

is what we really want.”
