This summer, while some students escape the Gtinnell heat
in ofﬁce jobs and air-conditioned movie theaters, Ecol-louse resi-
dents Caitlin Vaughan ‘11, Eric Nost ’09, and Jordan scheibel ’10,
along with Emily Sriever '09, will take on the role oflocnl ﬁu‘meis.
Inspired by last summer’s successful Project for Peace, the students
will be planting communal and personal gardens, encoumging
sustainability, and sharing knowledge with gardeners from the
Grinnell community.

“I’m really interested to gilrdﬁl‘l in Grinnell and get to know the
community here," Vaughan said, “There are people in this com
munity who know way more about gardening than I do, and I’m

excited about making connections and building a garden from the
ground up."

The Community Gardens Project received grants from the
sarih Boyel '08 community Service Fellowship, an award that
gives $3000 for a community service project, as well as President
Russell K. Osgood, Michael Sims and the Peace Studies. Prairie
Studies and Environmental Studies Programs Though the last
semester brough cuts to the community service budget, Nost said
that the project was fortunate to receive funding

The groups main goal is the creation ora community garden

students recently met with the Grinnell Area Parks and Rem:-

ation Board to ﬁnalize the location and run through their plans for
the summer 'VVt: wanted to work with disudvintaged communie
ties, and theres a pretty big north/south divide' in Grinncll," Nost
said. The gardens location will give disadvantaged families better
access to freshlytgmwn food and gardening opportunities.

scheihei says that although the garden will focus mainly on
large-scale plants like tomatoes, they have also discussed the bene-
fits otperenniais. “were thinking rhubarb, asparagus, bei-ry bushes
and ground cherry,” said scheibel, "Thar way, it the garden ever
becomes defunct, people will still be drawn to the space by peren-
nial things coming up every year.”

Last summer. students involved with Project for Peace organ
nized a Cooking class for families who received community Supt
ported Agriculture shares, or weekly shares oti local farms pmt
diicc, hoping to “get people knowledgeable about the sort ofthings
you get in a [CSA] b0x,"1\ccording to Nost,

Though the class was often sparsely attended, the students
rccognircd the community's need for a cooperative approach to
sustainable food. If gardeners an: able to share information and
techniques, community gardens are more likely to survive from
your to year.

This desire for a communitywyide approach inspired the group
to help Grinneil dwellers plant and maintain theii own backyard
gardens, Nost says they intend to focus on community members
who are limited by age or disability The group will advertise at the
Msiyﬂoumr Retirement Community this week

The past year has been successful for EcoHouse residents, be
tween lust summers Project for Peace and the continual work on
campus sustainabilityThc next step, Nost says, is to help the two
campus community gardens ﬂourish by giving students incentive

students could provide food to the dining hall and increase the
College's involvement with locnlfoodsr

“There are a lot or people who already do backyard gardens,
but 1 think that’s on the our," Nost said. “Especially in times like
these, where the economy is pretty right,I think sparking people’s
conscious on ways they can grow their own food is going to be a
main goal for the summer.”

Vaughan agreed, adding that community gardens improve nun
tritional opportunities for students and community members alike.
“I think nutrition is a big deal, and if there life vegetables around,
people are less likely to eat a lot or processed foods," Vaughan said,

It is almost summer break but just keep this in mind for later...
