Corrections

' Last week’s staff editoV
n'al was unclear when it
referred to administrator
pay raise. We intended to
state that only the pay
of the top five admin'
trators, not all adminis-
trators, had risen by 40
percent

IIn 1999, these top five
administrators made
roughly 73 percent of
what they do today; the
editorial stated it was 53
percent.

' Finally, tuition rose

by 8.5 percent per year
since 1999, not 7.5 per-
cent as the editorial had
stated, The 3&8 regrets

Bush should learn from Berenstain Bears

One of the first books I can remember reading is Stan and Jan Berenstain’s
Moving Day. Ir was my introduction to the marvelous Berenstain Bears, which
gradually matured into rho Bcrcnsrsin Bears Big Chapter books, was transferred
to the PBS television show, and than was abandoned as too childish.
Fortunately, now that I’m old enough to be childish again, I've realized
thcrc are important lessons to be learned from Brother, Sister. Mama
and Papa Bear, and nor jusr about the importance of teamwork and
friends.

As it is, Moving Day contains one stcnc rhar rcally sticks in my \
mindThar's doubly useful, bccausc it fulfills my need for an appropris -
ate column inrroduction, and because the Stewart Library’s copy is
checked out until March 1. This scene (which, in the interesrs
oraccuracy, could very well be from another Berenstain Bcars ,
book that I've gotrcn contuscd with this one) dopicts Papa /

Bear attempting to travel from the Bears’ old home to their l
new one. Along the way, he has a choice: rake rhc normal
road to the family's ncw house, or take an apponlinglooiong
short cut. Papa Bear takes the short cut.

Because this is a children's story, nothing bad happens,
just a couple ofamusing mishaps, But rho shorr Cur docs turn
out to be a lot harder (and take a lot longer) than the safe route would have been.

The dcstination,1 believe, is a Middle East that is not a breeding ground for
terrorism. President Bush (or, as we'll call him, in complctc disrcgard ofBush 41,
Papa Bush) framed his Mesopotamian excursion as a conrinunrion orthc war on
tcrrorism. l havc serious doubts about Papa Bush's sinccriry hcrc, but for rhc sake

of argument i’ll assume he was telling the truth,

Thc question is how an invasion of Iraq can get you there: 1 subscribe, by and

democracy Essentiallyl Support thc usc otAmcrican inﬂuence abroad to make

1 agree with Papa Bush that a democratic had is the place we need to got

stable dcmocracy. However, diis little short cut will cost far more in terms of
lives, money, and rcgiontil stability than a longerrterm, but less glamorous.

. Amcrican dollars should be spcar throughout the region to not
only support democratic actrvrst groups but also to improve econom-
. ic life. By supporting efforts to divcrsify Middle Eastern economies
away from oil, we con hclp to rostcr a strong, independent mids
dle class. Governmental change can be forced from above, as we
dcmonstratcd following World War 11. But sincc democracy is
by dcfiniuon a government by the people, it'd probably bc much
easiei in the long term to give oppressed people die tools and motivation to free

With Consistent U.s. prcssurc, Saudi Arabia can hopefully follow in the footsteps

Take it outdoors

Pissing outdoors is a celebration of conservau'on
and rrccdom. Whiic a problcm in urban areas due to
drainage problems and the build-up ofunseemly odors,
on a nice gnusy ﬁeld the urine just soaks back into the
ground. A problem with toilets is stray urine drops
landing on the rim and ﬂoor. Evcr sccn pct como our
in two diverging srreams at once? It ain’t pretty. The
enjoyment ofa outdoor piss is not a sexist tine, limited
to men only. I have known plenty of women more
than willing to pop a squat when a bathroom is not
readily available. It is a bit more complicated but these
progressive, fcininist womcn don't let mcn have all the
fun just because ofa fcw physiological difficulties. Uri-
nating is both a physical and mental act orrclaxation,
and what could be more relaxing than enjoying the
sights, sounds, and smells of the great outdoors while
peeing in a carcfrcc manner with no need to conﬁne
the stream to a bowl only a foot in diameter? Save wa-
ter. Enjoy nature. The world is our toilet. -

Learn to park, you idiots

I am tired of pulling into a student parking lots
and seeing wastcd spaces because people are parked
over the lines, or too close to the Lines, or diagonally
across multiple spaces. Why don't you peogle learn to

park your fucking cars borwocn rhc lines? he spaces
are wide enough for a 1973 Buick, You can at your
piddly ass Honda Civic into them. And if you do
happen to pull in and noticc that you're crooked or
over the line, how fucking long does it take to back
up and pull back in propcrly.> is scconds, maybe?
srop being lazy assholes and loam to park properly.
And don't even give mc somc bullshit rcsponsa about
the lines b ' ig rhc Man‘s way of crushing your inde—
pendent sp Nobody cares about your independent
spiritwe care about not getting frostbite because we
had to park tcn miles away.

Reuctionury'signs unfortunate

i shake my head at the pcoplc so quick ro put up
superﬁcial, reactionary signs next to the campus Ro-
publicans ﬂycrs, To those people who couldn’t stand
to have even a sign suggesting that there are organ
niocd chublicans on campus, 1 encourage you to
think about your responsibility as a member of this
campus to sngagc in meaningful dialogue with rhosc
who you disagrcc with instead of taking the easy
at all to
sway the opinion ofonc who does not think that all
chubllcans arc inhcrcntly fascist in your direction.
They only make me that much more interested in «to
tending a campus Republicans‘ meeting to see where
they are coming from, and to thank them for hav-
ing the toumgc to put up with a couple ofjcrks who
abuse their majority status by picking on the minority
like a couple of 6th graders. Must being liberal mean
just being aiirinRepublicanPI hop: not, because that’s
not what I signed up for.
