Queer community celebrates Coming Out Week

BYJAMES ANTHOFER

Coming Out week, a national event,
comes to Grinneu every yearebut this year
marked a year of increased collaboration and
interaction making the week not just open to
those in the GLBT community but to allies in
unlikely places. Beginning with the celebration
of Qlecr Shabbat in coordination with Che
alutzim last Friday, queer groups on campus
worked produced a Corning out Week that
skillfully incorporated diverse interests.

“We had stronger leadership this year,"
_said Queer People of Color (QPOC) leader
Erin Duran '09. "That led to a lot more col-
laboration and every organization helping
the others."Thc events that the groups hosted
included ally training on Sanirday, a screening
of"Trembling before Grd" on Sunday, discus

sion panel on Monday with the International
Student Organization (ISO), a community art
project on Wednesday and a fireside chat on
Thursday. In addition to the more academic
events, the groups also hosted a “BBQleer"on
Monday, and will conclude with the annual
drag show today.

Each of the events this week represented
an effort to add a GLBT voice to traditional
ideas and events, and bring all students in on
the discussion. “We try to bring in a lot ofdif-
fercnt issues, provide programming that we
normally wouldn't have," said (Amer Rainbow
Super Team leader Lauro Franco ’08. “Each
year changes depending on the sociopolitical
mood at the time.”

Ally training, which Franco assisted in
leading, offers allies a chance to learn about

the community and the personal experience
of being queer. “My theory on getting people
to become educated is to produce it cohesively,
like as ri community, so that the whole group

The student Programming commitree,
which funds all SGA budget rcrpiests other
than albeitmpus events, has already spent
321,500 of its budget, leaving only 34,900 to
allocate fol the rest ofthc semester.

This number is even lower, given that SGA
allocates to percent over what it atnially has
with the assumption that students wiu not
conic back for all reimbursements The actual
amount SPC has left is only $2500. Student
groups can expect many mole cuts and denials
to their hudgcts for the rest ofthc semester.

“Funds are very low at this point in the
semester, compared to where it would usually
bc," said SGA Treasurer Brad Bishop '08.

Tire connnittce only realized on Monday
that the situation had become so dramatic,
said Bishop. “Budget requests have been ﬂy-
ing faster and for larger amounts than we've
experienced before," he said.

Han Shin Lin ’08, a member of the come
inittee, was shocked at the news. “It seemed
like a surprise to everybody," he said. Accord
ing to Lin, SPC meetings do not generally’
look at the remainder ofits allocations, instead
assessing whether or not to grant money based
on presentations.

Committee members, including Bishop
and Alex McKinley ’08, argue that the prob-
lem arose due to more groups being involved
and organized. “In the past, we've found our-
selves relling groups we can't give them money
until they’re more established," said McKinley.
“But now they are more established so we’re
willing to give them more money.“

The committee has received 12 requests
for over $1,000, over double what they nor»
mally receive, according to Bishop.

He also noted that the end of Phase I of
the Lily Grant, the shifts in the CD0 bud-
get and Community Service’s static funds have
limited other common sources for student
group finances.

SPC will have to struggle to not run out or
money by the end of the semester. Grants like
the 84,600 given the Frisbee and the 83,900
to Water Polo will be rare in the second half
of the semester, as evidenced by the tabliilg
of Mock Trial’s budget and the severely rer

Campus under audit, salaried positions face dilemma

EYAHBV Rar-oroa-r

An IRS audit ofthe college's benefit packages may result in
a complete restructuring of salaried student roles. SGA Cabin
net members and editors of campus media, all of whom have
salaries rather than hourly wages, now face either becoming
poorly compensated volunteers or ﬁnding the tunds to pay the
positions minimum wageia signiﬁcant increase in their pay.
The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) stipulates that all
workers must be paid minimum wage, as well as be comp-err
sated for overtime. The state minimum wage will inciease to
$7.25 on Jan. I, 2008, a $1.05 increase from where it is cur-
rently set. According to SGA Treasurer Brad Bishop '03, the
. College is currently violating the FLSA by paying SGA Cabi—
net membels between $1300 and $1200 per semester, consider
ably less than the pay they would earn were each person paid
by the hour.
In addition, Cabinet members and editors often work far

more than 20 hoiiis per week, which translates to just a few
dollars per hour unrer their current salaiies.

To be compliant with the law, cabinet positions must ei—
ther become volunteer, which would drop their pay to a total of
sooo a year, less than a quarter ufwhnt they currently make, or
pay by the hour. Because few people are eager to see jobs with
such long hours become all-bur unpaid, most advocate ways to
find money to pay Cabinet members their 37.25 an hour.

The most popular option appears to be raising the student
activities fee $15 to $25 per student, as Bishop noted after pre-
s_enting the problem to Joint Board this week. “A lot ofpcoplc
are pushing towaid incicasing the activities fee," said SGA
Senator Nate Lindsey ’08.

But this option also has many opponents. “I don't think
raising the student activities fee is falt,"saidjcffSinick’09,who
served as Films chair last semester and will resume the position
spiing semester.

Lindsey agrees. “i think we should figure out a better solllr
tion than punishing the students for a slip~up," he said.

Many emphasize that the decision will largely be up to
students. “If it's going to be student Activities Fee, students
should have a say," said Kirby Rainstad ’03, Student Services
coordinator

Lindsey agrees. “linst hope .. . students will get involved in
this process," he said.

Some have suggested that cabinet falsify its times, so that
membeis appear to only log the hours equivalent to current
pay But College Assistant Treasucr Jim Mulholland isouick
to note that dealings with the IRS are legal matters. “\Nc want
to do the right thing—which means following the state and
federal rcgulations,"hc said.

Bishop also noted that timesheet fraud is a serious crime,
and conviction comes with possible jail time. “None of us want
