New Horizons alternative high school offers a different kind of education to both local students and college volunteers

studcnu that we will :xrend to them unconditional respect. We are
aware that they may make bad choices—really self destructive
choiccsibut they still deserve to be respected." This is a very new
dynamic to most students, many who have had a history of being
locked in battle with edummrs and authority rigutes. When you re»
spect them, Francis asserted, ”You change the balance in a way that

takes the shame away.” She continued, “When you

young adults are attending New Horizons
alternative high school.

Anumbcr orcrianell college students
have made the trip to New Horizons be.

that was located on Broad st in down.
town Grinnell. collegestudcnts have been
involved in [he aiternative high school for
several years, from studcno in education

students volunteering or doing internships,

Emily Mohl '02 has recently organized
a journalism program at New Horizons,
in which she and several other Grinncll
studeaovisit the high school once or twice
a week and help about a dozen students

put together a newspaper. Things are go..

lag slowly, according to Mohl.
“we were hoping to have something
out by the end orlastsemestcr," she said.

“We tell students when
they are coming into the
program that the staff is
responsible for themselves
and for the program, but
not for the student’s edu-
cation. Earning the high
school diploma is their re-
sponsibility and their
choice."

nator at New Horizons

take the shame away. it encourages them to look
squarely at their decisionmaldng." After looking
honestly at their choices, rnany students end up
choosing to devote their energies towards getting a
high school diploma.

The students end up at the alternative high
school after either dropping out oflhe regular high
school or being recommended by a school munaec
lot for the alternative programThesc students have
a pattern or not being successful in traditional
schools, although the trouble is not always acii»
demic. "we've had kids come to our program who
have earned rine grades," Francis reported. Often,
the problems are with attendance or there is trouble
with peer groups.

One alarming trend in the alternative school
which was adc
dressed in
“The Mcet- ,

ing," a play ,

behavior, attendance, and peer conﬂict issues that drive students out
or the regular high school.

ianccy Wicksrmm ‘03 is currently interning 14 hours every week
at New Horizons, as part ora requirement for he. sociology major.
As well as working directly with the students, she also arranges for
speakers to come into the school, Recently, they have had speakers
on a number oiissues. Grinnell‘s Vice—President for student services
Tom Crady has spoken about postsccondary education, and several
speakers have visited to talk about drug and alcohol issues. mental
health issues, and domestic violence. This week, the students are en.
gaged in a conﬂict resolution workshop.

l-‘rancts has been particularly positive about the alternative high
school's “wonderful relationship with students from Grinnell Col-
lege.” Not only have studcno visited the high school in order to
fulﬁll course requiremcno, but a number of college students have
been involved in programs like the newspaper course Mohl is orga.
niting. and other college students have been tutors. “The learning
on both sides was huge," Francis recalled bran Eduoition 210 class
that spent time at the high school. “Theie was a breaking down of
stcrtotypts on both sides.”

New Honzom was founded eight and a halryeais ago, and is part
of the growing movement or alternative high schools in lowa. Ac-
cording to Francis, thercare over 100 alternative high schools in lowa
alone, and new schools are opening all the time.

students who rind their way

but the first issue will probably come out ——

in early March. “its a big challenge Coot»
dinating 12 people into some sort of coherent schedule; deadlines
are a bigchallenge, and the alternative high school is even more ora
challenge." Mohl explained that this is because the structure orNew
Horizons is very diiierent from traditional high school.

The system is set up so that students work on independent stud»
ics at their own pace, and they receive as much credit as they earn,
which can be slower or faster than at the regular high school. Dead.
lines are uncommon, and so are a number oiotlicr traditional high
school practices, Arter all, most high schools do not have walls dos-
rgnated for students poetry, and most high school students aren't on
ﬁrstnarne basis with their teachers. A! New Horizons. the basic ap.
proach to education is different from regular public schools, and so
the speciﬁcs are different as well.

Lori l-‘rancis, the coordinator at New Horizons. explained the
schools overarching philosophy, “we tellstudents when they are come
ing into the program that the staiiis roponsible for themselves and
for die program. but not for the student's education. Earning the
high school diploma is their responsibility and their choice This
means that students are not punished for not completing work7
they simply dont receive credit, and educators at New Horizons are

ecamful not to bring shame into their interactions with students.

They do this, l-‘tancis said. through “a commitment we make to
