for a Friday afternoon inrerview wirh a visiringseholarrrom Nepal.
The only obvious diseussron area, rhe dining room rable. is oven
nowing wnh papers: somebody anonymous is busrling around
ihe knehen; and nvo or more youngsrers in rhe next room are
happily, uneeasingly, inexplicably bongrng on whar sounds like a
pair arbongo drums

Srhaneshvnr'ninolsinn works our surroundings inro his eonver-
sarion. “'l‘his areherype will definirely even cover rhar, shoe is
being made by my friends," he says as he gesrii res reward rhe din
rrom rhe living room.

He smiles and we oonnnue.

Timalsina, now in die rnidsrora (limeswcck srinr [cam—(cach-
ing Lidkc’s REL-295, Yoga Tradirions, is impossible ro keep in
