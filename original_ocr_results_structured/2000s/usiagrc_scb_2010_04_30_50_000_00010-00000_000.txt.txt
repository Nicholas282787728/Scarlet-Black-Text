Late April normally hrings Joy to the Grinnell campus with
the appearance ofhutiding trees and fresh green grass How
ever, one weekend during this blissful month may bring distress
to some when room draw looms ahead.
Despite the usual confusion that accompanies room draw,

the process seemed to go smoothly this year. in fact, room draw .

actually ended earlier than previous years, nothecause the Cole
lege was running out of rooms, but instead because everyone
who attended received a room.

“We feared we may not have enough doubles for rising
secondsyears [or] enough singles for rising third-years,"Tech-
nical Assistant for Student Affairs Laura Gogg said. Contrary
to Gogg’s thoughts, after roomsdraw occurred, singles were still
availahle on some pairs of campus.

“I think this may be due to restructuring special housing
draw—we added triples as an option to the special housing
draw," Gogg said.

Gogg is referring to the special housing draw, held on
Apr. 15, which assigned triples and group draws. This al-
lowed students who did not receive the rooms they hoped
for to reconsider their options before regular room draw.
“Students who ended up not getting [their room choice] did
not have to split up on the spot," said RLC for East Campus
Dan Hirsch.

Unlike previous years, those who failed to find a roommate
themselvesim‘ainly rising second—years— were required to fill
out a request form stating that they were in need ofa room-
mate.

”A bunch of students didn't find a roommate so they were
asked to sign a roommate request form," said Norris fourth
Student Advisor (SA) Emily Francis '11.

Within the next couple ofweelts, the Department of Resis
dence Life and Orientation will work with these students to
find a housing arrangement.

Those students lacking a roommate account for most of
the smdenlsﬂppmxlmﬂlely Soiwlio were nosshows at room
draw.

Room draw runs withOut a hitch-

Sunday’s room draw left the usually popular spaces open with room to spare

"I only remembered the time for room-draw because I woke
up an hour before i was supposed to show up and checked my
emails," said Maia Larson ’1], referring to the late esmail res
minder sent out by Gogg Sunday morning.

This late reminder may explain why some students did not
show up to claim their living space for n'ext year.

“Some studentsiespcclauy rising thitd- wears—apparently
didn't show upibecause of their shitty room»draw number,
they thought they wouldn't be able to get a single.“ said Younker
third SA Ishita Dharnidharka 11

These students were mistaken, as demonstrated by the
number ofsingles' in North Campus that were left open after
the Class of 2011 completed the room draw process.

But singles within the Clangrala cluster were not the only
rooms that were left.

“This year we still have spaces open in Loose. which may
not have happened before," Gogg said.

However, the fact that these rooms are doubles is a sign that
Loose has not completely lost its popularity, as there are no
singles available on South Campus.

“Singles in Loose went very fast," said Loose Pit SA Al-
ice Thornewill '11, Thornewill was surprised that there were
open doubles in Loose while other dorms that are traditionally
known to be less popular, such as Norris. were filled within the
first two hours of room draw.

“Surprisingly singles in Norris, that are converted doubles,
went fairly quickly," Dharnidharka said

The Norris singles disappearing prior to others located in
other locations on campus may signify that many more were
satisﬁed with their final room choices,

"Most everyone that showed up got what they wanted,"
Hirsch said. “There was a Variety of rooms left at the end.’Y

Gogg believes that thc end result will make assigning house
ing for the Class of2014 slightly easier.

“For the incoming class I don't have the same {car of holis-
ing shortage I've had for the last two years,"Gogg said. “It will
still be tight, but we Will accommodate everyone."
