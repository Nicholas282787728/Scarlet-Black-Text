Life: choose a college, choose a state, choose Grinnell

Last Sunday, Slimming Millionaire took
home the Oscar for Best Picture, and its di-
reetot, Danny Boyle, won the Best Drrecter
award.

Danny Boyle also directed the film Tim/k
spat/171g, which is basically about these heroin
addicts rn ireland (think ota lrglrter Rtyuiern
/n o Drona, wrrh a slightly happier ending—
although any endrng rs probably happier than
Rc'71lir'l .

The beginning sequence or the trim rt
a foot chase: main
character Renton
(Ewan McCregor) is
running away from
the cops riftei' knock»
ing off .\ convenience
store for drug money,
and all the while, there's a voiccovcr ochnton
reciting this monologwc about how drugs are
better than life.

Thus, in honor of Danny Boyle’s win last
Sunday,1 attempt to emulate that monologue,
but with a Grinnell twist. My intent is not to
say that Grinnell is better than life, but rather,
to present you this monologue and you can
make what you want of it:

Choose a college, choose a state, choose

lowa, choose Gtinncll, Choose your bed
sheets, your toothbrush, your window tan, your
clothes, your nricrowavc oven and your fucking

Choose the tireplace lounge, choose Bob's,
Burling ﬁrst, Brrrling second, a classroom rrr

Choose orr-carnpus, oncampus, sub-free,

Decision-making process of

One ofthc t'acts oflifc in colleges and unit
versitre 's that many resist the idea that th '
irrstitnrrons need to bc managed or admin
tcted, And, of course, individuals resist or diSr
agree with specirrc decrsions that are made by
other individualsAivhcthct the ptcsidcnt, a
dcan, or a department chair. This opposition
is frequently stated as opposition to “the ad
ministration."

But otcourse there is no simple thing or
entity that is “the administration." Nor are ad-
ministrators or decision-makers monolithic in
their thinking or their actions. Usually deci-
sions are the result ofa calculus of competing
suggestions, needs and plans that span broad
areas ofa college but generally have a primary
focus in one area.

The president is the most likely person to
see and experience the multiple perspectives
and demands of competing groups or iridit
viduals in an institution.

Alumni usually write to the president. Fact
ulty express themselves directly in their insti—

tutions of governance and also indrvrclrrally to
the president or even the members ofthe Board
otTtnsrees, students speak through SGA but
also individually, Start also speaks directly to
the president either by emailing me or by
stopping are as 1 walk around And neighbors,
community residents and other "outsiders" feel
frcc to comment to the president and others.

The hard part ot being the president is
weighing and nrclding together these many
different voices, which offer varying opinions
on rssrres frequently without the full context or
understanding ofwhat others believe or claim
or demand.

But there is no way around this difﬁculty
and the alternatives (not seeking or listening
to conﬂicting and competing advice) are even
worse than having to assess and act on them.

In making an ovetall decision when pre-
sented with varying inputs it is important that
the president have a consistent sense of what
he or she thinks the primary bases for making
a decision should be.

ting, Google it

College president explained

At Grinnell 1 think there is a consistent
and strong sense of identrty that is encapsu—
hired in our ofﬁcral documents, our core values
and the strategic plan,

matter is under consideration so as to elicit
comments from those who may have wisdom
on the subject but are not disposed to raise their

vorces without

 

It rs true that these
documents frequently
speak at a high level of
generality but they are
a starting point and a
framework for r 'ng

 

some invitation
to speak. Hare
ing said that, it is
also important to
, decide matters in
some reasonable

 

 

decisions. \Nhen I am

thinking about a dccision I think about how
the decision ﬁts into these documents. Some-
times a person will light onto one fedtute or
one of these documents and say that i MUST
decide in a particular way due to that one tac-
tor. But ofcoursc there are multiple factors and
considerations and they frequently tug against
each other.

It is also important in considering an im-
portant decision—unless it is a Conﬁdential
matter like tenure or promotion—to have a
process ot’ giving some public notice that the

frame of time.
Matters that drag on a very long time do not
get easier and such delaying, if pervasive, can
contribute to a sense ofinstitutional inertia
1 am not naive enough to think that you
should support what the president or some
other decision maker docs butI do believe that
colleges and universities need to be managed
and that making thoughtful decisions is some-
thing we can all contribute to by speaking up,
giving advice and thinking about the perspec-
tives of others at evaluating a decision.
