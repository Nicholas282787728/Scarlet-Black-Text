BY BRIAN SHERWIN

Last Wednesday evening, Joint Board approved the Fall 2008
SGA Budget with a vote ofIB in favor. zero opposed and one abs
stention.Thc $189,271.70 budget will be mainly diw'dcd amongst
Cabinet portfolios, with Concerts, Student Programming, All-
Campus Events and Films eolleetively accounting tor 72 pereent
of the budget.

For the most part, SGA’s income is derived from the student
activities fee, which students on campus pay each semester, SGA
reeeives additional funds from interest and endonent spending,
as well as income from the SGA poster sale.

In allocating the budget, members of SGA considers how
many people on campus will he aﬂected by the tunding allows
dons, according to SGA Treasurer Emily Wax ’09, who created
the budget.“one ofrhc questions with Concerts, Films, ACE, and
Student Groups—those are our four big budgets—is ‘how many
students are beneﬁting,“ she said

According to CND Senator Chris Johnston ’09, the biggest
budgetary concern arises from Student Programming Committee
budget, which funds student groups, and serves as the umbrella
budget for student funding. Last fall the SPC budget was allocated
part way through the semester, making it dimcult for groups to get
handing late in the semester.

The SPC budget has increased $11,000 from last fall, HOWT
over, to avoid a budgetary enmeh, SPC will only hind items es
senual to the proposed aeriviries, “We're having more things be
self-provided [by groups and events]," Johnston said. “Now ifit's
not something that‘s required for the activity, then it’s probably not
going to be funded."

Concerts is allocated the most moneywith a budget ofﬁ48,000.

“A number of people just look at that number and [are] upset
with it," Concerts Chair Peter Henry '09 said. “But it's kind ofnn
argument that hns happened every year that the concerts chair has
to defend and get the student body to speak out."

“With a big budget, I feel conﬁdent that I can use the whole
thing and reaUy cover as many people’s interests as possible,"Hen—
ry said,

ties, it’s concerts,”]ohnston
said. “And when I talk to
alumni either in person through Phonathon, some of the best
times they say they had at Grinndl are at concerts."

Anothei prominent budget item is Films,which has been allo-
cated 527,000. Films Chair Damien Von Schoenbotn Y10 said the
Films budget covers the Cost of DVDs and the rights to show the
ﬁlms, which range from $300 to $700 per ﬁlm, Von Schoenbom
said the large budget is necessary to maintain legality “We figure
that it’vve're going to have something on a weekly basis then we
should be on the up and up," he said.

The SGA Payroll is another major expenditure. The $18,100
budget makes sure that each SGA cabinet member is paid for 15
hours ortvork per week as required by an audit or the college last

year.
