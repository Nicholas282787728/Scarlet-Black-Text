To American students, Erie Staab
is just another name. To Kenyan stu-
dent Eric Omwega ’08, Staab is “Mr.
Grinnell." on sepr. 29, however, “Ml:
Gtinnell" will become “Mn Kalamas
zoo."

Staab, the International Admission
coordinator since 1996, will become the
dean ofAdmisslon at Kalamazoo Col-
lege in Michigan For international stu»
dents at Gi-innell, this means the loss of
a valued guide and friend,

Omwega remembered reading the
farewell lerter that Staab sent to every
international student. “My heart sank,”
ornwega said. “I was speeehless for 10
minutes."

Through phone calls and email,
Staab made international students
thousands of miles away feel like part
of the Gtihnell community. Assistant
Dean Janet Alexandel, director of In-
ternational Student Services, said one
international student told her that he
“chose Grinnell because he already fclt
like a Grinnellian. He said he already
felt very much at home, in large part
because orthe way Eric communicated
with him before he came."

In the same way, Fatal Rusinga
’08, originally from Zimbabwe, credits
Staab with helping him pick Gtinnell.
“[Staab] gave a very favorable impres-
sion of Grinnell and made me feel at-
tached to the place before I even came
here," Ruslnga said.

{or the international recruitment prov
gram. During his 10 years at Grinnell,
international applications more than
tripled, from 350 in 1996 to 1,100 in
2006. The percentage of international
snidents on campus increased from
around eight percent to 12 percent dul-
ing that time, well above the national
averae for liberal arts eollee.

The College’s ﬁnancial resources are
responsible for at least part of this in-
crease. By heavily promoting scholar
ship opporrunitres abroad, Staab helped
make Grinnell affordable. “I made
Grinnell a wellsknown school for great
students and a great school for students
who needed ﬁnancial aid,” he said.

At times, these scholarships extend-
ed beyond tuition.

Even with a generous scholarship
from Grinnell, Talent Takundwa ’10
was unsure that he could comfortably
afford the plane tickets from Zimbar
bwe to Iowa, He talked to Staab and
was able to receive an additional schol-
arship from the college.

Despite his move to a higher posis
tion at Kalamazoo, Staab is still “hot-7
rlbly sad." “It‘s an exciting opportunity
to load an othee, it’s a great school to
work for,"5taab said.“But it also means
leaving a program that (or 10 years I’ve
developed and leaving the studenrs
I’ve recruited over the years."

Staab insisted that nothing will
change about Grinnell's international
student program. He is spending the
rest ofhis time here traveling in Asia to
finish his part of the fall reeruitirrg. A
Search {or his hillstirne replacement will
begin in late spring, but Swab is eonrrs
dent that whoever is chosen, Grinnell
will continue to create a welcoming
envtronment for international students.
”It’s not me who makes this happen,"
Staab said. “It's the college.”
