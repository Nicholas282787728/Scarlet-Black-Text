Dear Editor:

I am wnring bemuse ofan unusual siruarion rhar has occurred ro
a friend ofmine, who did not wish ro wrire for himself My friend is
aseniorwho is double majoring in marhemarres and economies, My
friend has essennaliy majored in rhese subjeers since his freshman
year. However, smee he enjoys marh more, during prc»r:gisrrarion
sophomore year, he deeiared hrs math major ﬁrst. He did nor declare
his economics major unni rhe beginning ofior semesrer. in order ro
declare a double major. one musr ger ir approved by rhe regisrrar ro
ensure rhar one achieves a good liberal arrs eduearion. After rhar, one
gers a second adviser and works wirh borh in order ro fulfill borh
majors and graduare.

So, my friend has fulfilled all rhe requiremenrs for his economics
major except for one eoonomres seminar, which he preregisrercd for
lasr semesree He wn unable ro rahe anorher seminar because he had
ro rake a rnarh elass ar rhar rims. Av rhe end of iasr semesrer he found
our rhar hewas eiosed our ofrhe seminar forwhich he had signed up,
My friend wenr ro ralh to the head of rhc eeonomics deparrmenr
who roid him he would have to drop his eeonornies major! However,
he wenr ro rho professor of the class ro discuss his siruanon and rhe
professor said he may be able ro ier one more srudenr inro rhe riass
and rhar he would ier my friend know before elasses srarred rhis so
mesrer. When he rerurned ro umpus rhis semesrer he found mar he
was srill nor in rhe eiass (which only has 13 srudenrs) and char rhe
professor had in faer ier anorhersrndenr in insread. Apparenriy, rhe
srudene were allowed him rhe else based on when rhey declared
rheir major.

My friend rhonghr rhar rhis was rarher unreasonable, so he wenr
ro talk ro rhe head of me eeonomies deparrmenr, who onee again
roid him rhar rhere was norhing he eouid do and he would have ro
drop his major. By rhis rinse my friend was very angry So he wenr ro

the dean of srudenrs, who said rhere was norhing he could do abour
ir. Finally, he took rhe marrer before rhe proidenrofrhe college, who
referred him hack ro rhe head of rhe eeonomics deparrmenr, My
friend wenr bad< to rhe head ofrhe coonomia deparrmenr, who roid
him rhe maaer was “over" and he should jusr give up.

This is rhe mosr despicable, unreasonable, and irrarional rhmg i
have ever heard a deparrmenr do ro a srudenr. Perhaps i have misun.
derstood rhe goals of rhis school, our i have always rhoughr rhar
when you declare your major, your adviser and rhe deparrmenr cry
rheir besr to ensure rhar you eompiere your major, As an anthropol»
ogy major, i have had a very good experience working with the fac»
uiry wirhin rhe deparrmenr, Many ofrhem, parrieuiariy my adviser,
have gone ro grear iengrhs ro ensure that i was able ro gee inro rhe
classes I wanred in order to eompierc my major. Apparenriy rhis is
nor how rho eeononnes deparrmcnr works. i hope rhar rhey can
remedy dais siruauon for my friend. Orhcrwise, i would implore un-
dereiassnacn ro rhink hard abour wherher rhey really wanr ro declare
rheir major in adeparrmenr rhar rrears irs majors in rhis way.

Poli h House gone

i was disappoinreei to hear rhar Polish House has been rorn down.
To my mind. irs desrruerion was a clear expression ofrhe perpetrar
rors' arrimde roward rhe noble eounrry ofPoiand. They have made ir
obvious rhar rhey do nor wanr rhis narion ro be represanred in irs
righrfui piaoe (berween rhe rwo houses rhar rcpresenr Germany and
Russia), and have symboliealiy wiped ir off rho map. This has already
happened ro rhe real Poland me many umes rhronghour history; ir

was unneeessary to drive rhe pornr home by an aer ofeensorship and
vandalism.

I doubr rhar ehis desrruerive aer ean be sueeessfully passed offas
znything ouran insuir ro Poland and she Polish people; Polish House
was a nibure ro rhe uarion, nor an insuir or a joke. i would like ro
eongramiare rhe people who buiir Polish House for rherr valianr eh
fores, andi am sorry rhar rherr work fell prey ro censorship. Long live
Poland _ and freedom of expression.
