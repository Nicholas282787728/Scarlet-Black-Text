While students all over campus triumphantly finish
hell week, th icls and Field team begins their most im—
poitnut met:
the 2‘110 T 't and Yield Midwest Outdoor Confciencc
Championships, held in lacksorwillc, Illinois. During the
nvo day meet, the men's and women's teams will compete
against their eight Midwest Conference rivals for the top
spot. Last year the uteri ﬁnished third and the women
fifth. This year, the men's team hopes to repcat 2009’s por
diuin finish.

“1 think it we run really well we can get in the top
three." said David Montgomery ’10. “I think this year we
have enough dcptli acioss the board in all the events that
we could score really well ifcveryone's on their game,"

The women struggle due to a lack of members this year
but hope to have lots of good individual races.

“1 just want all of our athletes to compete in their
events," said Interim Women's Head Coach chr’ Pedersen
'02. “That's one thing we’ve tried to stress from day one
this year (hi: aspect of competing, against other people
out on the track."

The team is unusually small this year due mainly to the
absence ormany strong runners from the class ofzml.

“[We have a] much smaller roster this year." Pedcrsen
said. "We have 11 or 12 distance runners abroad this se-
mester and then we have some other little nagging injuries."

As small as the team may be, they have grown signiﬁr
cantly since indoor track season.

“We should be much more competitive than we were
in Indoor" Pedersen said. “We’ve added a few new atl-r
letcs from other sports they're looking to do some good
things."

Additionally. the women's team is looking to the llurT
dies, distance events and the young sprinter phenom Iszr
belle Miller’l3 to pick up points for the team.

“Distance is traditionally strong," said sprinter Frances
Leslie ’10, “Isabelle Miller is amazing. She just can do ev—
erything really well."

On the men’s side, the strength comes from Kyle

runners, The team has shown their depth by replacing
many of the school’s top ten best marks throughout the
season. Due to these positive results from the men's and
women’s teams the excitement for the weekend is growing.

“This is the meet they've been working for since Janu-
ary" Pcdcrscn said. “All the meets count but this is what
they're building for.“

Despite the excitement, this remains one of the rough~
est academic weeks for many student-athletes.

“It's always ironic that we’re supposed to get the most
sleep of the season this week [while] it's hell week and cv—
eryone's working really hard on academics," Montgomery
said. “So conference never comes at an ideal time for us but
I think people will be ready conic Friday and Saturday,"

Baseball sweeps conference, championships ahead

The Criiinell baseball team has finished

sweeping conlercucc play But now then real

Despitc tirinnell's wellrsiatcti objective,
they know they are not the only team go—
ing into the tournament looking “too hot to
handle."

“I know that the teams from the North are
very talented but pist from the schedule we had
in Florida. and the nairconfercnce teams we
played, gave us a lot of conﬁdence and really
prepared as," said center fielder Matt Skelly’iZ.

Although the team will be hosting, they
will still try to take advantage of the underdog
role.

"I guess North thinks of the south as a
weaker division because they always take the
tide, but we’re excited to show them that the
South is much more than that,” said second
baseman Chad Takahuki '10,

An enthusiastic outlook is nothing new
for the squad, as they’ve been looking to win
conference from the ﬁrst day or leagnre play.
This was not the case for the team last season

though, as they simply were content on make

Biinn Sollo '10.

“Coming into the season we had
two goals to has; conference, win
the South Division and the second

we've completed our ﬁrst goal we
are just excited about trying to come
plere the second goal."

With these goals in mind,
Grinnell knows that they have to

“In the end, we must continue to
play our game which is based on solid
pitching, great derrnse and situational
hitting," said Head Coach Tim Hol-
libaugh.

Now that Grinnell has completed
their first goal. they are ready to
suit up and focus on the next. in
stead of distracting themselves by
looking back on their accomplishments from
the regular season,

“It really only matters how we do this
weekend. the 1270 record would just be like
ri consolation prize. but it really doesn’t matter

that much," said pitcher Andrew Platt'lS,

Looking past the conference tournament

this weekend, the team will be primed for
another great season in 2011. The Pio-
uters can look torward to adding a group
or stellar ballplayers from around the
tummy.

“\Vc have iiddrcsstd the needs of
our team at middle inneld, pitching and
catching," l-loUrbaugh said, “It is a solid
group of 11 tirst years at this point that

graduates and they know it will be tough
to replace their leadership and skill.
That being said, the team has been
able to see how reliable their backups can
be. as they have stepped forward when
called upon with rousing success.
“This year we had such great
. depth whenever someone went
down we had another player come
up." Sollo said.

Despite this conﬁdence in their funirc, the
team that remains will still need to do some
soul searching, as a new team always will,

”At the end or every year you have to look

at what you did well, what you didn't do weu
and the players you have returning," Hnl-
libaogh said, “From there, it is on us as coach-
cs to develop a plan to improve the players we
have venturing,"

The graduating class will also have to do
some soul searching as they say goodbye to
what was such in important part of their life
for four years.

“l'll definitely miss the days that the wind
is blowing to left field. because it was always
fun to hit honicrtins on our small field," Sollo
said.

The bottom line is that all these ins
ward reﬂections can take place after they fin-
ish off this season. For right now, the Pioneers
need to focus on playing by their mantra,
which is to alunys be in the moment and soak
in everything about it.

With Grinnell playing their best baser
ball in years, they need to carry their swagger
through this weekend and make this a season
that will be discussed for years to come.

“Last year we were havmg just as much
run, but this year we have a little more ora
swagger to us because the senior class has
been playing really well and it's been rubbing
offon all ofus, hopefully we can put it all to-
gether and surprise the North,” Skelly said.
