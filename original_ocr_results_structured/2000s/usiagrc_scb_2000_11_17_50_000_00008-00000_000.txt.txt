Black death
sweeps U.S.

This week, I make hin or;
- The Plague
- students who study abroad
- The CDC
- Al Gore
- George w. Bush
- Medieval Europe

WASHINGTON: in 'an epidemie that hasn't been seen
since the fourteenth eemiiry, the plague has reappeared and is
sweeping the united states. The Centers for Disease Control
announeed that the disease first appeared in the unsuspeeting
town orctinnell, lowa. where it was introdiieed by a student
returning from studying abroad. The student in question pre.
rers to remain anonymous so that her {trends and family will
not avoid her like, well, the Plague. The girl, who spent a se.
mester abroad in Honduras, said it never oeeutred to her to get
vaeeinated against the Plague: “I mean, come on, its the {make
mg Plague! Nobody
gets that anymore.
How was I supposed
to know?" The CDC
eounrered hetreniark
by saying that aetually
she was supposed to
know, and that she
would have been
warned about eone
tracting Plague in
Latin America ifshc had simply gone to the CDC's web page,
as was recommended by her college's offaczimpus study ofﬁce,

After the students return to eampns, the disease spread
throughout the sehool and town, it apparently spread much
more quickly on the southern end orcampus, due to more lax
sanitary eonditions, but the eollege's small siae made it impMe
sible to keep it from reaehing north eampus. After ten days
most orthe campus was infested; the gymnasium and seienee
building were converted into makeshift inhrmarios, and a quare
antine was put on the entire town. it looked as it the disease
eould be kept under control and contained. but the quarantine
was broken when three students sntiek out or Grinnell to get
pierted in lowa City. The young man that pierced them was a
student at the University orowa, and in a matter ordays most
orthat campus was infected as well. By the end ortheweek, the
disease had spread to both eoasts ofrl-lc us.

The CDCsays that the United states ean expett a so pere
eent to 80 pereent drop in population over the nexisix months.
Federal omeials in Washington said that soeietv will crumble
and mayhem will ensue irthese proyeetions are at all aeeurare.
They said we should expeet a return to the feudal system in
place in Europe at the time oithe original Plague, with most oi
iis destined to become mere pcons toiling away rorevei under
the tyrannical rule oroui feudal overlords. Both Al Gore and
George w. Bush have eompleteiy forgotten about their bids for
the Oval orriee as they returned to their walled compounds in
their home states in Preparation for their lives oppressing the
weak.

V: i have really no opinion.

the point in the semester where suddenly all those papers you
meatit to start working on weeks ago finally rear their ugly,
almost.diie heads. Desperate try to catch up, reading assigne

pretty creative backup eateer plans, in anycase. however, while

about tlic beneﬁts or hunkering down into hermit-like studi-

people they love otherwise you'll go mad. and that's nist one
more stressor you don't need.

P. To defend the hermit population, 1 will rust say i enjoy
my lirestyle, i don't think it's elitist to say if
someone wants me they know where to ﬁnd
me. Also, What Alli says is generally true;
being a hermit does give you more time to
get work done; however. that does not mean
that we don't pioetastinate, we insomniae
hermits proerastinate just as mueh as the
next guyor gal orwhomever, but i also get a
ton orwotk done, or at least what l think is
a ton oiwork. one, however, must always

A: Yeah, we know this artiele may seem a bit disjointed.
The stress is. oieoutse, aireeting us too. whatever the stress or
stressor, though, try not to let it bring you down too much,
You're smart kids, you ean handle it. As my buddy from home
says, “Be brave little bearlsl" (Nonsensical? A little, but it's oddly
comforting anyway, isn't it>).

There are several issues that are annoying me:

I. Receiving the following message in the mail “The ad.

ties, as far as law enioreemeiit goes."

2. irresponsible drinking behavior in my dorm that pisses
me on.

Did the person consider the enllege has a legal obligation

Enforcing the law would he a joke. The allure of doing
something illegal helps polish the gloss. And, as the aleohol
eommittee has already acknowledged. eratking down on drinks
ing is likely to drive it underground, increase aleohol consumpe
tion, and prevent the deans from helping those who might be
ahaid orgetting in trouble.

The exeiises being made on this campus are being used as

honestly believe what they express and iollow what they say,
but this doesn't carry for at least part orrlie student body.

l'ni listening to the dialogues that have been going on this
