u Online services used by students, faculty and staff joined
forces this summer to increase efficiency and utility

BY MARv PARKER
Students checking their grades and class

p“ lists this sunrmer discovered that something

‘ was different: Blackboard and l’ioiicerweb
had been inregrared into a single portal,
which is one web page thar dirccrs users ro
many services and resources,

The new system is called Pioneerweh bur

, uses the Blackboard porral ro integrate class
discussion boards, class lists and administra-
tive information such as grades and academic

. hisrory. Modules also draw data from sources

' ranging from the college calendar to the New

. Yotlemcs.
i “Pioneerweb becomes a lens to see all
these rhings," said Brent Jaeger, manager of
. Campus Information Services. “Because it's
role-based we can change the lens so that it’s
more suitable for students, faculty and other
groups. The Blackboard Enterprise portal
released last year gave us the ability to go
beyond course managemenr and offer more

-, services via the interact."
The roleebased nature of the portal pro-
vides different services and modules when

~* accessed by students, faculty, staff and guests.

Users can customize the appearance of their
portal by choosing from a number of differ
' cm modules.
As the systems were previously constructs
j cd, Ploneerweb offered access to administrm
'_ tive services, while Blackboard was intended
for course management: the two systems had
separate authentication and each required a
‘ unique password.

Jacgcr says that one of the main reasons
for merging rhe systems was increasing ac—
cessibility and conveniencc.This leads to the
use of“single point ofaurhenricarion," mean»
ing rhar although the adminisrrative services
require users to log in a second time, the user
name and password remain the same for all
services collected in the portal.

“It’s a security issue," explains Jane
gcr. “There’s a hierarchy of sensitivity of
services."I—le notes that the college is mow
ing towards the possibility of a single logon,

which would require a user to enter their
password only once, bur that upgrading the
porral is an evolutionary process,

According ro Avram Lyon *oo, User Con»
sultant Coordinator, the merge has been an
improvement in some ways, but there are still
quirks to work out. “The end result of it is
that it now takes more clicks ro get where you
want to go," said Lyon.

Saurabh Saraf ‘05, spokesperson for the
Student Academic Computing Committee
(SACC), sard that the SACC feels that there
are certain advantages to having the Systems
combined into one portal, but recognizes that
services alt: limited and hopes that the portal
will continue to develop as more students and
professors begin to use ir.

According to Saraf, SACC would like to
see a single logon and receive more informa-
tion about specific plans from Information
Technology Services (ITS) concerning future
upgrades that affect the availability of the
Pioneerweb scrvice.

ITS will continue to work with other
offices on campus ro provide more services
through the portal. Everybody has an inrere
est in trying to make the user experience as
effective, efﬁcient and rich as possible,' said
Mickey Municyyice Presidentfor Commue
nication and Events. Communications and
Events provides some of data for the portal
modules such as the calendar and controls the
college’s wcb presence.

Munley downplayed problems in the
merging of thl: sysrems. "There was creative
tension, but everyone has a shared agenda,"
he said.

Next up, ITS \vill address Pionccrwcb
questions ofoff—campus acecssibiliry and de—
ciding what services people are most inter-
ested in adding. ITS says that ir is invesri-
gating expanding access for alumni, who ar
the moment have only basic guest access and
therefore cannot access all ofrhe information
available to the current onscampns commua

niry.

Darkroom, ceramics spaces not available

Loss of the Craft Workshop to the demolition of Darby and a small budget
for chemicals leaves students craving a place to develop photos

EV CAITLIN CARMoDv
Due to student publications’ use of digital cameras and the
craft workshop darkroom disappearing with Darby Gym, snr
dents no longer have a place to develop their film on campus.
Before rhis year, srudcnrs could use the dark room in Darby

Riley said.

According to Riley, he and his srafr prefer digital cameras
because they are easier and faster than film. "I prefer film ro
digital when I’m dealing with art stuff, but as far as yearbook
goes, it is nice not to have to spend the time developing film,”

for a fee of 40 dollars, or the darkroom in the
publications budding if they were on a pub~
lication‘s staff.

Now, with both the SUB and the year-
book, Tl): Cyclone, using primarily digital
photography, the publications darkroom has
a budger otbuly 350 ro spend on chemicals
and paper

According to yearbook cditorJusrin Riley on, 350 will not
last the entire year. Riley originally asked the Student Publica~
tions and Radio Committee (SPARC) for 8150 for darkroom
supplies, but reduced the amounr when SPARC asked him ro
cut 32000 from his overall budget.

cid Standifer'07 is feasibly rhe only yearbook statfmembcr
who will be using rhe darkroom this year. "Personally, i have an
aesthetic preference for film." Standrfer said. “I really like rhe
whole process ofdoing something real insrcad of just pulling it
up on a computer."

”There’s a big prob-
lem when a liberal arts
school doesn’t have a
darkroom on campus."
—Justin Riley ‘06

Even though his staff has gone digital,
Riley feels that replacing rhe Darby dark
room should be a priority.

"There's a big problem when a liberal arts
school doesn’r have a darkroom on campus,"
Riley Said. “They tore down Darby Without
any alternative for a darkroom and I can't her
[love there’s not a dark room in the fine arts
building."

The Joe Roscnficld Campus cenrer originally included
plans for a Crarr Workshop in the basement bur the space was
cut relatively early in the planning process, according to Eli Zir
gas on a member ofrhc Campus center commirree.

According to Tom Crady, vice president for Strident Ser—
vices, the Craft Workshop may and a home in whar is now
Cowlcs Dining Hall, “We're dclinircly open to [a new dark-
room], but we’re far enough away [from renovating Cowles]
that we haven't figured rhar our yer," Crady said.
