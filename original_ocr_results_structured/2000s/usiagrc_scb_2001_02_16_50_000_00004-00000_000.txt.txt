Au Fait

by Sarah Aswell
Arts Editor

As usual, I don't
have any solid facts to go
on, but it what I
overhearin the ioggia is
true, these new uher-
cards are going to serve
as keys, IDs, laundry
chips, library cards,
student trackers, actual
cash, tirne cards, and
cheap plot lines for a
half»dozen technology-
thrillers in which
yesterday's famous actors
who prostitute their
talents ror money portray
Cardboard characters who
have their already two
dimensional identities
stolen by villains whose
only lines are "Get me
that microchip!” That's
right, starting as early as
next semester you will be
able to fit your entire life
onto one little card.

This is good on a
few levels. First of all, it
will give the student
body a chance to hone
their problemsolving
slilk when presented
with the prospect of
having to pay for laundry.
Secondly, no matter
where i go or what I do,
Gn'nnell College will know
exactly where I am and
wholanr with. Doesn’t
that sound comforting?
lastly, I am guessing it
will only be a matter or
time before the
administration adds other
functions to the uberr
cards that will allow for
students to register, take,
and pass classes all in a
single swipe.

Of course there is a
downside to these new
cards. I heard from an
unreliable third-hand
source that our ﬁrst year
pictures will be thrown
out and new pictures will
be taken. If liberrcards
go into effect, I can
never again glate down
at my gnarly ﬁrst year
picture and say to myself,
”Jesus, things are only
getting better,"

Despite this small
loss, I’m sure I'll think
my libel—card is pretty
darn cool untill lose it
on the very first day,
making it impossible for
me to enter buildings,
get food, check out
books, or have my
whereabouts accurately
tracked by ihe Man.
Without my card, I will
also be denied access to
emergency phone lines,
makeshift shelters, nuts
and herries, and fresh
water, which by next year
will certainly all be uberr
(and controlled. In fad,
I wouldn't be surpn'sed if
giving up and
succumbing to the
elements could only take
place after showing Dacry
my proper ID.

A: Ar rhc request ore Cermln Harris Center em»
ployee (who we will refer ro only as Sarah Karon), I
will not write anyrhing negative about laer week's ﬁas-
cocs at Harris, Sufﬁce it to say, Sarah would feel rc-
ally bad, and I’m all about positive iovc during
Valcnrinc's wcck, So, in order [0 fulfill this obliga-
rion, I'll just say that I love seeing ﬁlms at Harris.
Where else can I see movies, that are in order sumcr
times, for free? The answer: nowhere. And I love
films rhar are like Choose Your Own Adventure books.
So I say, continue on die ﬁne parh you've crearcd,
Sarah. I’ll be forever grateful.

F: I think rhcy should cur the movie into Zrilich
strips, and rhcn rcnrrnngc randomly. Maybe do this
with Ttham'x, rhcn watch the audience go into scnr
