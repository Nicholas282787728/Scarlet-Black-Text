Debunking race myths

Last week. a Grinncll student updated his
Plan with disturbingly uninformed, privileged rise
serrions about aﬂirmative action policy and Giin-

nell's hiring practices. Regardless otthe inhcts
ent contradictions in his argument, and abrasive
manner in which the argument proceeded, our
main concern is that similar sentiments concein-
ing afﬁrmative action and diversity are c mmon
on campus,

The student’s asseition that “the purpose of
afﬁrmative action ' [O ‘lcvel the playing field’ or
economic opportunity" is simplistic and myopic
Firstly, since people of color miculiu‘ly African
Americans, have been historically prevented fiom
accumulating wealth, it s nearly impo role to
simply “level the playing ﬁcld" and provide, what
he crdls, “equal footing." Legd equality by no
means ensures actual equality Strategic cl‘ imi~
nation throughout history against people of color
can only be remedied by strategic int/noon.

A society that ignores the icality oflnsting opt
piession only makes matters Won‘ .The students
comment that he “had a chronically rtrnny rinse
from kindergarten to sixth grade and had tar
highei social barriers than the {cw black kids in
the class” indicates his ignorance on the subjects
oflr' orrcal racism it is one thing to question the
reality of social harricts and research the subject
using Grinnell's abundant lcsourccs: however, it's
entirely different to miike uninformed assertions
that ignore the lasting eitects ot‘historicril govern-
merit policy.

Furthermore, the student's interpretation or
the purpose of alritmative action disregards the
crucial notion that there Cxls s a “compelling state

Editorial

 

 

Our response to Carroll

If you vc made it this far' in the SSCB,
you've probably already read about the
mailing from the Republican Party ofiowa,
warning voters that Democrats were regis-
tering “Grinncll Colicgc students from
places ike New York and Massachusetts to
vote in Iowa."

The mailing Is ortensive dntl insult-
lug. It insults college students who grew
up in Grinncll and the surrounding area.
It insults all students who don’t identify as
“eiiStTCOJSl liberal kids,” and it insults any
that do. It insults the people who come to
Grinnell tor college and choose to make it
their lifelong home. It insults and tlndoes
the work efpeeple who have put a heck of
a lot of effort into improving town»gown
relations over the years,

None of the 5&8 editorial staffgrerv up
in Grinnell, Powcshick County or Mal-iiiska
County—we’re from Iowa, Nebraska, Illi-
nois, Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio/Pennsyk
Vania, Hawaii and Indiaibut we ﬁrmly
insist that those Grinnell College students
eligible to vote should accrcisc this right in
Iowa. Many of us are far better informed of
and engaged in local politics here than we
are of politics at our permanent addresses.
For many ofus, Grinneil is our home.

Despiteoirranger,however,wchopethat
the mailing can provoke more constructive
examinations of mu own roles within the
community where w live. Interpreted sym—
pathetically, thc ma mg intimates the core
concern that students should not engage
politically in a community in which they
do not sufﬁcicnlly engage in other ways.
While many programs and individual ace
tions increase positive towntgown inter
action, it's still terribly easy, especially for
those who live on campus, to get stuck
within the “bubble," barely leaving campus
and engrossed in academic and personal
concerns. We should do our best to break
our, The greater the interaction bcnveco
college and non college Gririncllrans, the
more we, as a community, can break down
negotii c stereotypes held by some members
ofboth groups.

Recently re elected Iowa House Rep;
resentrrtive Danny Carroll’s campaign is
widely rumored to be behind the offensive
mailing. While none of our sources have
been able to specifically connect the mails
ing to the Carroll campaign, Curtoll ex—
pressed similarly objectionable sentiments
in on Election Day interview with KRGN.
Though Catioll has already taken stances
opposed by many students, lets hope thitt
he and his ticwiy- elected colleague in the
state legislature, Tom Reilly, consider the
concerns ei'ttudents with the same weight
as they do those concerns of other constitur
ents, Gentlemen, you are our representa-
tives, and we do represent a significant por-
tion of your constituency. Represent us, or
yotr will lose our trust and our votes.

We must assert otlr right to alert our
government representatives in Grinnell,
rind we also deserve to have them truly
represent us. By thc same token, then, we
acknowledge our part ofthc responsibility:
engaging in the greater community, trou-
bling ourselves with local aff. iis, seeking to
improve the town where we will live for at
least so months. If we expect non-college
Grilincllians to think ofus as more than
just intrudeis who study at it college that
happens to occupy ptur of “their town," we
must think of Gtinncll - more than just
the town in which our collcgc happens to
sit. Grinnell milst become our home,
