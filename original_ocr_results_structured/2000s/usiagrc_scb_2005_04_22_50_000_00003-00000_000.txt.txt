CONSCIOUSNESS

Grinnellians find different ways to protest the war in Iraq and educate others
about the possibility of a military draft and conscientious objector status

BY BEN WEYL

As U.S. troops continue to be called up to serve
in Iraq, the refrain Give peace a chance" is becoming
more vocal on the Grinnell campus

Though student peace activism is less visible than
it was in the early days of the war in Iraq, some have
continued to advocate for peace and have been trying
to raise awareness of how to get conscientious objec—
tor status. Last Friday, April 15, the group handed out
literature on being a conscientious objector at tables
in and outside the post office.

Consciousness on campus.

On Monday, April 4, the newly established Peace
Studies Program invited Rex Friend, a lawyer and
activist from Oklahoma City to discuss conscien—
tious objection. As part ofhis law practice, Friend has
worked with soldiers who have decided to become
conscientious objectors and leave the military

At the talk, Friend said that students who were
opposed to war needed to be acting now if they want-
ed to be eligible to be conscientious objectors in the
event at a draft. “He talked about building a personal
file of documentation about your beliefs relating to
war and how that needs to begin immediately," said
Kent McClelland, professor ofsociology and chair of
the steering committee for the recently~created Peace
Studies Program. “If there is a reinstitution of the
draft and you just throw together a statement, it’s not
going to be nearly as persuasive as if it documents
an extended period of opposition to war,”

McClelland speaks trom experience. “I myselfwas
a conscientious objector as years ago, at the time at
the Vietnam War,” he said. McClelland objected to
the war on religious and moral grounds, and the local
draft board anwed him to become a conscientious
objector. He served two years of
alternative community service in
Alaska, as well as inner-city Cam-
den, NJ, McClelland said that
these experiences helped shape his
worldview and prompted him to
become a sociologist and a (Link-
er.

Although the draft ended in
1973, the Selective Service bureair
cracy has been retained, and men
ages 18 to 25 still have to register with the Selective
Services, McClelland claims the Selective Service
system could be ready within two to three months,

”It is not inconceivable that in another year or
two, the draft might be reinstituted it’ they continue
to have problems with recruitment," he said.

In February 2005 the Army fell short of its
monthly recruiting goal by 27 percent, as reported by
the New Yuri Timersln March 2003, the Almy missed
nearly one third of its recruiting goal. Prior to this
past February, the Army had not fallen short in its
recruiting goal since May 2000

Anti- draft organizations like wwcu riodraﬂnn’way
mm report that in late March the head ofthc Selective
Service system told President George Bush that the
draft could be ready to implement in 75 days.

Chris Gaunt, a librarian and peace activist, is also
hesitant to rule out the possibility ofa draft. “I do
think we are very much moving in that direction,"she
snid.“Itwould be easy to say,‘no, it’s not going to trap
pen,'bnt1 think that’s what the administration wants
us to think.”l3oth McClelland and Gaunt believe that
ifthc draft is rcinstituted,ivomen will have to register
as well as men.

Liv Gibbons ‘08 has begun compiling her conscie
curious objector file because she agrees. “Either way,

”ll lakes 0 patient efforl [a gel
people aware and to convince
people that there is a possibility
that things could change.”

it is good to have a conscientious objector file started,"
she said,

Gibbons is one of the few students involved with
the small peace group. “If killing is something you
think you just couldn’t do, then you need to start a
file now." She has long been interested in advocat»
ing for peace. “I came to Grinnell because I had been
socially active in high school and really involved with
the peace movement,” she said.

The Selective service website repeatedly denies
the idea of an impending draft, citing the overwhelms
ing Oct. 5 defeat of H.R. 163 in the Us. House of
Representatives. The bill had called for a reinstate-
ment ofa military draft.

Marching for peace

Students, faculty and staff have alsojoined togeth-
er in a weekly peace march to protest the Iraq war and
engage the community in discourse. About 10 people
usually attend.

The idea {or the peace march came out ofdiscus-
sions within the Quaker group on campus and is not
connected to the Peace Studies Program.

“I remember when we came back for this semesr
ter after winter break especially within the (baker
group, there was a real feeling that we had to do some-
thing, and [the march] came out of that,"Gaunr said.

The peace march is led by an ad hoc group of
mainly faculty but some students who have been
meeting to "try to raise awareness ofthe ongoing war
in Iraq and general opposition to the political simat
tion in Washington and the Republican administrar
tion,"McClelland said.

The group meets at 4:30 pm on Wednesdays
to plan various actions. At noon on Thursdays, the
group meets at Herrick Chapel and walks across came
pus and downtown with signs to
raise people's awareness about the
ongoing conﬂict in iraq,

The peace marches have pro»
duccd mixed reactions. “When
we walk to the Forum we feel
like we're preaching to the choir,"
Gaunt said. “But then when we
go into town, sometimes we get
thumbs up and sometimes we
get ‘this thumb'," she said as she

Chris Gaunt

waved the bird.

Localized efforts

The group has been doing peace marches since
late February but does not have any illusions about
causing sweeping change. “It’s a small gesture," Mcr
Clelland said. “It takes a patient ectort to get people
aware and to convince people that there is a possibil-
ity that things could change."

“The goal is to call attention and raise awareness
in the community as a whole and to bc a consistent
presence,” Gaunt said, “There is a need to do some-
thing rather than nothing 1 know that I didn't raise
my son to go and fight and kill other women's sons."

Recently, thc group has been marching in conjunce
tion with a group of local pastors headed by Charles
Pope of the Episcopal ChurchThe pastors are inter-
ested in supporting conscientious objection and call
themselves the “conscientious patriots."

Gaunt also sees hcrsclfas a patriot “The best way
I can think ofto support the troops is to demand that
they be brought home alive today," she said, “That is
my way of supporting them. I don't have proof, but
1 have to believe that, of the men and women serve
mg now, there are numbers of them sitting there and
thanking me."

Pro-Palestinian
speaker draws
support, criticism

av DILARA YARBROUGH

On Wednesday. journalist All Abunimah spoke
in Main Lounge on the ongoing IsreaeliePalesunian
conﬂict.The talk was the first event sponsored by the
Palestinian solidarity Group. This conflict has be-
come a growing topic of discussion this semester, with
the recent formation of a small proelsrael group and
controversy over the Palestinian Solidarity Group’s
user and Plan name, [intifada].

Abunimah was born in the United States of Pal-
cstinian descent. He specializes in Middle East and
ArabeAmcrican affairs at the University of Chicago,
and is a popular writer and speaker on the subject.
He is also the founder of the Electronic Intifada at
hilp.-//e/em-onir1ntgﬁzr1a.nee.

In his talk, “Palestine/Isreal: Is peace really about
to break out?" he discussed historical and recent den
velopments in the conﬂict, expressing his views about
the role of Isreal as a colonizing power, the interna-
tional misperception of Palestine and how the myth
oftemporary conflict prevents peace Abunimah critie
cized what he called the rhetoric of “a window of op
portunity for peace."

“The death of Arafat or the removal of Prime
Minister Sharon changes exactly none of the condi-
tions that make conflict inevitable," he said,

Abunimah said disparity between rights afforded
to Israelis and
Palestinians
is the cause
of contin—
ued conﬂict.
"There are two
totallyseparate
systems of law
and the one
which affects
you depends
on your religion, lfyou a member ofthe dom ant
ethnic group, you have rights. Ifyou’re a Palestinian,
you have no rights."

He discussed how widespread segregation in the
form of roads and walls provided evidence of injustice.
“Israel is the only country in the world today where
the roads you can drive on depend on your ethnic
group," he said.

Abunimah expressed concern about global and
U.S. perceptions ofthe conﬂict, as well as portrayals of
Palestinians as a violent people. He identiﬁed types of
both non-violent and violent Palestinian resistance.

During his presentation, Abunimah also ad-
dressed an onrcampus ﬂyer campaign that depicted
Israelis killed in suicide bombings. He condemned
the bombings and expressed grief at the deaths of
those pictured. “Armed resistance includes legitimate
forms of resistance and illegitimate forms, such as sui-
cide bombing," he said.

“Palestinian resistance has succeeded in making
the Colonization efrort very costly to Israel but has
not succeeded in stopping it,"Abunimah said.

Abunimah’s talk met with mixed reactions. Irina
Usherenko ‘02, who formed a campus proelsrael
group last week, said she was frustrated by the pre
scntation and Abunilnah’s response to her questions.
“I'mjust mad that I want both sides, and I feel like he
neglected to demonstrate both sides," she said.

Usherenko said she disagreed with Abun‘imah's
ideas and rhetorical style, finding his speech propae
gandistic.

Nabiln Mnrzouk ‘07 agreed with much of Abun-
imah’s presentation. “I thought he was pretty good, as
a person who comes from the Middle East. I think
that's the opinion that we have back home [in Mo-
roccoi.”

Miirzouk thought that Abunimah offered a good
idea for beginning to create peace. “I think we have a
lot ofhistory and distrust that needs a lot ofcoopera—
lion so that we get rid ofit,"slic said.“VVe have to ﬁnd
a middle ground to be able to work it out."

“I think we're both hoping for peace, both Pale
cstinians .ind Israelis,” Elena Rubin ‘07. Rubin plans
to start a coalition that she hopes will “build those
bridges and tear down those walls."

Marzouk pointed to the need to continue raising
awareness. “I don’t know ifstudents knew a lot about
the subject,” she said. “People will learn more about
the issue ifwe have a variety ofopinions on campus."

”There are two {oral/y separate not
terns iii/aw If you’re a member
of the dominant ethnic group, you
have rights. ifyau’re a Paieslinian,
you have no rights,”
