Singing and dancing in sexy musical

 

G I M P

Hal/0A am Is less ﬂash than some ofGlMP’s
from p' 1 recent endfavors like zrinllthin or Ul‘ml'la‘tml.
lVIarx chose it intentionally to add depth to GliVlP's repertoire. “In
the fall, we really like to do big musicals that get a lot of firstsyears
involved and are just really fun and crazy," Maix said. "But foI the
second semester,l think it's fun to try to find a smaller musical,
maybe one thatjust has sort ofdifferent feel to it."

This semester GIMP was faced with an unusual element ofcoms
petition—for the first time in five years, the Tlicatrc department also
produced a musical, T/ie Beggars oysaa. Roughly half the cast was
in both plays, so Hello Again often rehearsed In the afternoons and
on weekends to accommodate uctors’schedules. Being in two shows
was rewarding, according to Anna Werner ’09. “It was fun because
.it was a change," she said. “The roles were just so drastically differs

nt,,.thc language is different, and doing a different kind ofdanee."
“it was a good change of pace, but we had no lives," said Stevie
Schein’08,who played one of the lead roles in TbiBiggati 0pm. “I
mean, we still don’t, really. But i was rehearsing upwards oralmost
30 hours a week.. .I never slept."

Hello Again will be performed in Bucksbaum’s Roberts Theatre,
but that wasn't the original plan. The Theatre department fust de—
nied GIMP’s request to perform in Roberts, but allowed them to
use it once they discovered Harris was unatmilable due to the spoon
concert. “Roberts or the Wall were really the only other places we
could go ltwe didn't stay in Harris. so we begged." said Marx.

GIMP has performed musicals in nearly every feasible space on
campus, including the Forum North Lounge, Heriiek Chapel and
the Harris Concert Hall. Last year was the first time they used

Blicksbaum, performing Zombie Plum in Flanagan Theatre and
Floyd Cal/int in the Wall, “We like to use Theatre department spaces
because they have a lighting system and better sound quality, gener-
ally, than other more found-type spaces and Harris,"said NIarx.“But
it’s hald to get permission to use Thearrc dcpartmciit spaces, so it
doesn't always happen."

Webb \vas especiall grateful for the use of Roberts, since stu-
dents are only allowed to use the Theatre clepaitment’s costumes if
they peiform ln Bucksbauin. “And even that's irot guaranteed," he
said. "Because we‘re technically not supposed to, but we're kind of
changing it. Hopefully this will be a nice precedent that we can rely
on in the future."

him said that GIMP should have freer access to Bucksbaum
performance spaces. “What else are these spaces for, except for put-
rrng on shows?" she said. “And if nothing’s going on in them, then
why shouldn’t we be able to use them?"

GIMP walks a fine line betwccn being independent and bet
lag connected to the Music and Theatre departments. Kim, who
organized the sevensmember band, sard that while he appreciates
GIMP's independence, he would have beneﬁted from more departs
mental support. “Ideally, the band and the cast would have Music
department space to rchearsc,"he said,

Many GIMP members spoke about the group’s unique niche on
campus. “It‘s really different from the things that the [Music] de-
partment usually does,” said Wright. "There’s this need to do theatre
at Grinnell that’s kind ofintellectual, academic, and the paint is to
learn something. And I think the audience can learn from [Hello
Again], but at the same time it’s a lot more fun and acceSSIble. "

Mouthful of Bees, a four-piece band from
Minneapolis, found its name through a come
bination of tragic current events and popular
culture. A friend ofthe band, Andrew Larson,
heard on the news the unfortunate tale of a
young man who died of an allergic reaction
when his girlfriend kissed him shortly af»
rer eating a peanut—butter sandwich. Larson
noted the ties between this sad story and the
plot ofa welltknown 1991 film where a young
girl’s sweetheart, who is allergic to bees, dies
after being attacked by a swarm ofthem. Lat»
son made the sage comment, “Well, it would
have been really sad in ‘My Girl’ if she had a
mouthful of bees, and he was allergic to bees,
and she kissed him."

And thus, a band name was born,

So far, Mouthful of Bees has been around
for slightly less than a year, but they've found
unanticipated success on the college/ihdie
rock circuit.Their first album, ironically titled
“The End,"has now been on the top 100 chart
in college Music Journal for over six weeks
and peaked at #38, setting a new record for
their label, Afternoon Records. They have
been featured In the Minnmpalii Smr Tllblmt,

weekend they will have the chance to open for
the popular indie- rock band spoon on Friday,
April 13 at Grinnell, which, if all goes well,
could lead to even more recognition,

All of this has left band member and
Grinnell student Chris Farstad ’09 feeling a
little surprised. “I didn’t expect it,” he said. “It
just happened. I'm not complaining."

Farstad started playing music with his sise
ter, drummer kart. early on in high school,
with a band that, in retrospect, Farstad said
was “terrible." After graduation, the two de—
cided to continue playing music more seri-
ously and eventually teamed up with longtime
Farstad fan Mickey [\lfano (bass) and friend
Mark Ritsema (guitar) from a band called
The Battle Royale to form the band as it is to-
day. Farstad only ietrirns to Minneapolis over
school vacations and on weekends. so their
entire first album was recorded and compiled
during fall break, 200a.

Listening to their album, it's not hard to
see why they've received so much praise. It
has rough edges, having been recorded, may
tered and pressed (and by pressed they mean
“binned to CD using personal computers ) in

five days. But the tracks pulsate with energy,
and Farstad’ s catchy guitar solo' in "The Now
grabs your ear and doesnt let go. Maybe it's
going too far to call Farstad’s voice “angelic," as
Afternoon Records’ website does, but it‘s cer-
tainly not half bad. All in all this is rather im-
pressive, given that, according to Farstad, the
band’s decision_to make an album in the first
place was almost a joke.

After Tb: Eur/s first loerech release, the
album found its way into the hands of Ian Ant
delson, the owner ofAftetnoon Records. After
giving Tb: End a listen, Andeslon offered to
re-release it. The label also hired a publicity
company named Vitriol to circulate the album
to college radio stations, which is how it finally
broke into the mainstream of college rock.

So far, Farstad isn’t banking on continued
success, but he says he plans to continue plays
rug with Mouthful ofﬁces for as long as luck
continues to work in the band’s favor. The
group is planning on doing their first tour this
summer, and another album is tentatively in
the works.

Of course, all of this is assuming that die
saster doesnt strike Farstad is incidentally, alt
lerg‘ic to peanuts.

Listen for Led Zeppelin at Spoon concert tonight

 

 

BY Clu STANDIFER

Trying to figure out What bands have influenced Spoon is a
bit like trying to tease the ﬂavors our ofa glass ofwine. “Hmm,l
taste a little French oak, a mild hint of sulfur, and. . .‘sniff‘. .is that
..‘sip‘. . .The Beatles?” ‘
It might seem extreme to compare a laid-back indie rock band
wrth the Beatles, but rock music critic Matthew Perpetua at 1:1qu
blog.coin backs me up on this oncThe Beatles undertones come
through particularly strongly in Spoons “Lines in the Suit” on
the 2001 album Girls Can Tell and “Chips and Dip"on their 2001
E.P. Low Wayr.Then again,In “The Fitted Shirt” offof Gfl'll Can

Tell, I’d say they’re borrowing their guitar from Led Zeppelin,

"Metal Detektor' from A Safe: afSnm/u( 1998) ends with some
lovely melodic distortion a la _Sigur Ros, and Ill be damned if
“Mountain to Sound" from Soft Eﬂcm (1997) doesnt sound ever
so slightly like sonic Youth

But some things have remained constant and uniquely spoon»
Ish since the band’s inception in 1993. Spoon‘s trademark is essent
tially a lack ofmelody from the instrumental scction.The guitars
and keyboard all generally stick to a onerbar repeated riff that
serves as a backdrop through the entire song, occasionally framing
a brief, simple guitar soloThe centerpiece is always Britt Daniel's
voice,rvhicli has evolved over the years but still tends to be rhroaty
and iror clearly enunciated, perhaps in an imitation of someone

who rs fairly stoned. Daniel stays in the middle range and keeps
it simple.

But mther than making their music tedious, all of these limits
combine to create a kind of tension. As a listener, you're always
waiting for them to burst out into a jam session, and Daniel's
voice always sounds just a bit like it wants to break out ofits little
onescrstwosoetave boxThis is what draws you in and keeps you
listening, and once you get Into it, It becomes hypnotic. i suppose
this might be the definition of “catchy,” the defining characteristic
of good pop music. spoon is nothing impressive, and you wouldn't
call the musicians virtuosos, but their music Is quite likeable,

Spoon performs tonight at 9 pm. in Harris.
