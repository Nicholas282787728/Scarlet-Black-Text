Steve Wood ‘04 sets the all—time Grinnell scoring record and the Pioneers make a statement with three straight wins

b y J o e G e n i

Steve Wood ‘04 scored nearly 150 points in three games, Paul
Nordlund ‘06 added three particularly timely points, and Grinnell
remained unbeaten in its own building this season.

in a span ofﬁve days the Pioneers ran over Beloit, slid past Carroll
and obliterated Monmouth, moving to within one game or the
Lawrenoe Vikings at the top otthe senterenee.

“I believe it will take 10 league wins to get into the playoits," said
head coach David Arseneault before his team picked up conference
win numher nine against Monmouth on Tuesday “But, we are still
setting out sights on something higher, We are now one game be»
hind Lawrencc and anything out happen over the last so games so
each on: has increased sigirineanee,"

“I think ifw: sweep this weekend, we will win out," Said Wood.
“Ifwe do that, there is still a chance we cold host the tournament."

The Pioneers won't get to play Lawrenee again, hut they rate two
tough oppontno in st. Nothert and RJpon this weekend on the toad.
Grinnall heat hoth teams at home early this year on eonseeutive days
hy a eomhined total of ﬁve points.

“They were hoth dose games here, and playing on the
road is always tough too," said forward Cole Rohertson ‘05,

“They're pretty good matehups, They have pretty good
athletes and good shooters, so they’ll he tough games."

Grinn:ll is getting used to rough games titer Saturday 9, Q"

night, when Paul Nordlnnd ‘06 had to hit a long three, it
pointer as time wound down just to forte overtime in a
1337133 win against Carroll. But though Nordiund’s shot 5.,
was the most important or the weekend, stove Wood ‘04
stol: the show hy sheer volume.
Wood entered the weekend just 145 points short
or topping Terr Clement ‘99s eareet seoring mark
of2,229 points, and 145 points is esaetlywhat
he got. one day ahtt dropping 55 points on
Beloit in a 155438 win, Wood reeled oir47
against Carroll, and the Pioneers needed ev.
eryone ottltsm. With 18 seconds to play,
the visitors capped a 13.4 iuit with two
free throws that gave them a 124.
in lead, Grinnell sailed for time.
“I told the guys that i
wanted stove Wood to bring
the hall up the rourt,” said
Arseneault. “l expeeted

The younger Nordlund, who had missed a layup on
Grinneli's previous possession, nailed the gam:»tying shot
from deep in the corner with 11,4 seeonds left. Carroll turned 1
the hall over and the game went to 0T, (

“We just med to get outselves rired back up," said tonvard Cole
Rohertson ‘05, “just to start oiithe overtime fresh, and take it right
at them, dont give them any hreak. don’t give them any test, inst take
it tight to them and outplay them In the next five minutes, oi in that

As it happened, the omeials accidentally shot rolled the overtime

“Going in, we didn’twanr to overlook anyhody," said Robertson,
“Monmouth got their first two wins in the eonierenee last weekend,
so they were coming in on a high note, and so were we,”

drained a 3tpollllcr from the tomer to earn his 1,000th Cal‘eci‘

point, and Grinnell taeed to 17541 advantage at the hieak,

The only suspense after that concerned whether or not Giin-

nell would douhlt Montnouth's store (they did, 154-76),

and more importantly whether stove Wood ‘04 would set

With ahout ﬁve minutes ro go, Wood stood inst six points short

“Boeause the game was men n hlowout," said Wood, “it helped

Track season begins at Iowa State, Mt. Vernon

by Kevin Byrne

The men's and women's track season opened
with a meet at Iowa 8mm Univcisity last Saturday,
Jan. 31, and produced some good Pioneers score:
and some interesting international tensions.

“The best part of my raee," said Justin Riley
'06, “had to b: passing some old dude in a ‘Russia’
uniform right at the end. I was like ‘Suck it Former
Soviet Union!This isAmctica, Bamll’ It was a great
moment."

What Riley lacked in international diplomncy,
he made up for on the traek. He was one of
Griniiell's top ﬁnishers in tlic 3000-metcr event,
plaeing sixth with a time ofﬁAlAfl. Some ofhis
teammates also posted low times, with Mitclt Here
’06 (mile » 4:29v67), Knbenlai Armah '04 (400
metals - 51,42),Yatherddrle ‘04 (200m 723.46),

and isom Winton ’04 (400m . 53.31) all having
good days. Winton, NtirAddncv l-leia, and Atth
then teamed up for the 4x400 meter relay and ran
3:29.62, a respeemhle time, especially for thesrart
ofz season.

The big story for the Pioneers, however, was
the running orAdam Booth ‘04. Booth set a new
zllvtime Gtinn:|l reeord in the 3000i“ with a time
0f8:31 .92, good for a second place finish. He man.
aged to make tip ahout 20 seconds throughout the
race on the eventual winner, David Choromei
(8‘17.01),from Butler Community College.

“Adam Booth and lustin Riley ran very strong
raoes in the 5000 Saturday," said men's eoaolt Will
Freeman. “Adams time orgasi is the fastest ever in
eonierenee history and oieourse is o seltool resord.
Riley {war} not far hehindl"

The women's traok team only brought two
members ortheir team to the lowa state meet, de.
otding to sontenttate more on upeommg meets,

“We had never intended to hring many aths
letes trany to the lowa state meet," said women's
eoaelt Evelyn Freeman. “We had two women
sprinters who got rheir rear war and min well for
this early in the seoon

Kate Ditdrisk 07 and chikanaehukwtt oh
were Grinnells two representatives, with Diedriek
plaeing 38th in the zoo—meter race with a time of
28,43 and Nwaohulnvtt zioth in the same event
with a time ot3022 soeonds.

“it felt great to get haek into track compati»
tion," said Diedtiek. “I was very excited to he shit
to go, althoagh l wasprotty nervous. l deﬁnitely
did not do as well as I vvould have liked, hut sinoe

it we the ﬁrst meet orindoor season in trying to
look at it as statting point in which i will have
more room for improvement as we get into this
season."

The men and women will have their next
ehanee at httther preparation and eompetition this
Saturday as they head for Mount Vernon, low,
and the Hilltop open at Cornell college Both
teams are looking to improve slowly in their train»
ing so 3 to hit their peak during the important
meets later in the season.

"our goal is to get out root wet in eotnpeti.
tion, use the meet as a high level workout and to
shetk to see how the training is going," Evelyn
Freeman said As always, we will torus more on
the competition at the end otthe season "
