Homesicknes

As the days grow colder here in Londonl have been
overcome with a ridiculous t’ccling or hornesickncss
The novelty orbcing abroad has worn undeniably thin.
as well as my bank account, and I long (or the controrts
of home. It is a natuml state of affairs for most people
abroad so Iwill be sidetracked from my usual ‘Go Lonr
don’ propaganda and speak to this feeling.

Not surprising, the recent gutrwrenchirig elCC’
tion has played a major part in feeling homesick Now,
whether that is sick ‘for' or ‘of' home is anyone's
interpretation, but the term deﬁnitely applies.

I didn’t want to weigh in on the election
seeing as I'm not the most politically-mind-
ed individual and my views on what hap-
pened would probably have are burned
at the stake if I was in Grinnell, btit as
your Overseas Correspondent I cannot
shirk my duties for Fear of death, I’ll
just choose my words wisely.

the scarlet and black

British facade was starting to crack,

Facing an unspoken wrath from Londoners as you
passed them on the street was probably the worse—
speaking with people in pirbs, on the street, or in the
tube, we became the mouthpiece for the Americans
who had not rerelceted Bush, a tonc of pleading and
apology in our voice as we sheepishly spoke in our
American accents.

I told you we would have quite a unique perspective

during this semester in London.
And while the political world is a mess of
rlickers of rrnger and hoperlessness), the US
is not faring very wcu economically heic ei-

ther'.

Vth we arrived in London, things
were not the best, but doable. In rough
terrns, the market value or the dollar
was around 55pcncc. Now rt is down to
aborrt 52pencc. That might rtot seem
like much, but those pence add up,
they start to trickle fioiri your bank
account, and you begin to long for
living and breathing with the dolr

 

 

staying up to watch the results roll
in but also thoroughly upset about what those results
were toning us. Comments about rnovirtg to Canada or
planning Grinnell Campus secession from the rrrriorr
became edged with sincerity

Watching the BBC coverage of our election was
arguably the only upside to the whole debacle~they
attempted to be as nonpartisan as possible, birt when
Bush started to edge ahead, you could ten the polite,

Danny Carroll should apologize for Campaign

lar, and only the dollar.

Most ofirs are pretty naive about the nitty—gritty of
inﬂation and whats-it economic stuff(unless you are, at
which point, you are or the minority orour age group,
tnist me). Force yourself to see your money in terms of
its value to another currency, like the pound. and you
might want to invest in some Kleenex (only four dollars
u boxl).

So at this point there are a few Grinnell-in-Lon—

l The election, the dollar
l exchange rate and your mom

doners who dream or anything but living in the us.
because Bush is sitting pretty, again. Brit on the other
hand we wouldn't mind be able to use our dollar for its
worth in the economy it theoretically supports, instead
of the British economy which laughs at its plntrsized
stature.

But there’s homesick and then there's homesick

Politics and economics are all fine and dandy but it
won't take long for it to become a dull roar, a tiny nag
ging feeling, and poorit’s gone again (especially in the
face of homework, homework, homework!) But your
mom will always pull on heartsttings.

Your mom? What on earth do I mean by that?

Obviously, it is of course, your mom, as rn your fam-
ily, as in those people that you don’t get to see much
when you are at Grinncu anyway, but being halfway
across the world mcans you sec and talk to them even
less

More importantly, it’s ‘your mom.'1t's that strange,
twisted contest of bnnlct between friends about who
did whose mom in what way last night, this morning,
or rorcveri It's that thing you do with yourflml/lr that
you can‘t get while abroad.anst me, you can’t respond
to a Brit’s polite,‘Paidon me’with ‘ereI pardoned your
mom last night' (or some such).

Even rtyour mom jokes aren't something you and
your absent friends do, I can guarantee that they miss
you. so send out an e-mail saying Bush sucks (and our
plans or Grinrrdl secession) and that you're sorry that
the dollar exchange is crap (though you should research
their market), with a dash of true Grinnellian humor,
and really brighten someones day.

I’m interrupting my usual spontane-
ous rambling this week For once, I’m gun
ing to make much ado about something.

By now you’ve probably seen Danny
Canon's campaign pamphlet from several
weeks ago, wanting voters that the Demr
ocrats had “registered a large number or
Grinnell College students from places
like New York and Massachusetts to vote
in Iowa.”The caption underneath an imr
age of ﬁve threatening—looking students
urges Iowans not to “let 1,000 east coast
liberal kids elect your State Representar
tive." You’ve probably also heard about
Carroll's statement on KGRN, congratu-
lating voters on “overcoming"eollege smr
dents who “voted a straight Democratic
ticket most likely"

As a Grinnell College strident, a lib-
eral Democrat, a native New Yorker with
family and roots in Massachusetts and a
resident of this town, Im having an aw—
frilly hard time containing rrry anger- to-
wards Mr. Carroll, and I am not a person
who is easily angered. To quote The Mum
thm, Dinn'y Carroll and 1 could probably
stand touching noses {or .r ivcclcnl a rinse

other local residents. It's also true that,
like most coucgc students, we Grinnel-
lians aren't necessarily planning to stick
around in our college town once we grad-
uate. Howeverror the {our years in which
we are here, Grinnell becomes it home to
most of us, and the place where we spend
the majority of our time.

It's worth noting that Danny
Carroll’s term in office is two
years. By the time they gmdur
ate, inost Grinnell College
students have been in this
town for twice that long, It
is petfeclly legal for college
students to vote iii the town
or city where they attend
school, and wrth good
reason, not only are we
directly affected by
local policies and
politics, but we are
also members of this
community, Unconventional members or
the community, perhaps, but members of
the community regardless.

work hard to benefit this town in other

ways. Grinnell Couegc volunteers work

with high school students at the Galaxy,

mentor and befriend children at the Da—

vis school, and build houses with the local

Habitat for Humanity. College students

are involved members of various churches

in Grinnell, and student teachers in the

local school system. Although most of us

are “not from here" and possibly “won’t

stay here," that does not prevent many

or us from being active in this com-
iuunity.

I also have to admit that I am

baffled by Mr. Carroll’s Character

dents as “1,000 east coast liberal

kids." According to the \‘ieW’

book published by dieAdmis-

sions Office, only 16

upsetting, not only because Mr. Carroll
seems unwilling to acknowledge that stua
dents deserve representation in the state
government, but also because someone
who is supposed to be one orout leaders
is actively creating tension between local
groups. Although interact-ions between
college studens and townspeople are of»
ten friendly, this is unfortunately not al-
ways the cuserTherc have been numerous
cases orstudents being verbally harassed
in downtown Gnnnell, and on several

page or the 5ch reported that a college
student had been shot by a horse gun on
Eighth Streer.I love this town and would
like to see these occurrences become less
frequent, but when local politicians ac—
tively perpetrate division benvecn stu-
dents and townspeople, I don't see how
things can possibly improve,
