Mosr disrnaying ro me was rlre “smoke-out" held by some
srudenrs on Monday. Typically, a “smoke-out" is an evenr where
people resolve ro ouir smoking ro improve rhe healrh of rheme
selves and rhe people around rhem. However, Monday’s “smoke.
our" was a bunch of srudenrs showing no ineenrion of qurrring
smoking and proresring for rhe abiliry ro harms rhemselves and
rhe srudenrs around rlrern wirh rherr smoking. I hope rhe next
rune someone is angry abour the prospesr of going ourside in

Monday’s ”smoke-out”

Questionable
connecﬁon

As Russell Osgood and Tom Crady so frequenrly, indeed,
nearly solely, crre “healrh concerns," albeir raised by orhers, as
rhe iusnhcarion for rhe proposed smoking ban, l rhink ir is nee.
essary for any reasonable eonsrderanon ofa smoking ban ro firsr
aeeonnr for rhe faer rhar rhese eoneerns are enurely miseoneerved
and uniusrined. smoking in a separnre room rhrough a elesed
door, wirh plenurul spaee in berween iusr does nor impose del—
ererious healrlr efieers on non-smoking neighbors.

smdies rhar have found links berween secondhand smoke and
grearer risk ofcancer and orher healrh problem have been cone
fined re cases of persisrenr immersion in smoking environmenn
flighr arrendanrs on smoking flighrs, ehildren raised by smoking
parenrs, workers in smoking environmenrs and rhe like. cerrainly
Grinnell dorms are none of rhese rhings and norhrug like rhem,
bur regardless, ir is illusrrarive ro examine Grinncll alongside ar
leasr one oi rhese eases,

consrder rhe workers rn a smoking environrnenr, rhe leasr
dissimilar ease ro Grrnnelrs, A srndy ﬁnding an effeer far siren»

Moss sueh sransnes, rhrs one included, are reporred mislead.
ingly. A 13 pereenr inereased “risk" oflungeaneer means rhar rhe
pereenrage ehanee oigerring lung cancer for sueh people rose by
13 pereenr rfrbrirn‘rr'nlrole one souree (The Rllodc island cane
eer Conner) gave 7 pereenr as rhe cxpcctcd likelihood of any
given American developing lung eaneer ar some rime in rheir
life, (The number rs eerramly lower for nonsmokers, bur I’ll give
rhe benefrr ofrhe doubr.) Now, 13 pereenr of7 pereenr is 0. 91
pereenr so rhe srarisries from rhis parrieular srudy rhen suggesr
rhar a non srnoker working in a smoking environmenr would
have sornerhing rn rho range ofa 0.9l pereenr grearer ehanee of
developing lung cancer. Now, srnall rhough is is, 1 would agree
that even rhar is more ofan inereased risk rhan anyone should be
compelled ro aceepr. However, rhe ease is nos ar all comparable
ro Grinnell dorms, where rnvolunrary exposure ro smoke doesn’r
even remorely approaeh rhe same scale.

consider rhar rhese nonsmokers were immersed erghr hours
aday rn rhe same room wirh sub»
sranrial smoke for slzeablc poi»
rrons of rheir lives. Nonsmokers
ar Grinnell, meanwhile, need nor
spend a single hour in a room
where rhere issmekingand need
her spend more rhan a few 56»
mesrers in a smoking‘doml. (The
srudy m quesrion found a srrong
link berween rhe duranon ofex-
posure and rhe degree of ins
ereased risk) The smaller durar
rien efekposure, relarively lower
densines ofsmokers and separa—
rion by a hallway is likely more rhan suiheienr in alrnosr all cases
ro remove even rhe mosr infmiresimal healrh effeer as found in
rhe srudy and for rhose earraordinary cxccpilons, a shur door or
open window will srrike rhe inﬁniresimal risk ro zero.

I looked a long while for a srudyofasimilar ease ro Grinnell’s
and I wasn’r ar all surprised ar berng unable ro had one. i would
suggesr rhar nobody has borhered rrying to srudy sueh an effecr
beeause rr requires only a brief familiariry wirh rhe srarisrics of
seeond hand smoke or. really. rusr some small modieunr ofcom»
mon sense, ro know rhar sueh an effeer is our worrh srudying,
beeause ir is elear rhar ir iusr won’r be rhere. lfanyone ean ﬁnd
sneh a srudy, however, I do invire rhem ro prove me wrong.

As rnvolunrary healrh risks among nonsmokers are simply
nor a eonseouenee ofsmekrng m Grinnell dorms, i can only cone
ceive ofrwo possible cases for eaeh ofrhe “health eoneerns" rhar
Crady and Osgood say have broughr so ruuelr pressure on rlre
adminisrrarion m enaer a ban: hrsr rhar srudenrs annoyed ar rhe
smell padded rheir eomplainrs wirh eoneoered rears and seeond
rhar parenrs and students misundersrood rhe narure ofseconds
hand smoke. As rhe heads efan insrirurien ofhigher educarion,
i would expect adminisrrarors, when presenred wirh misinformed
eoneerns abour healrh, ro iusr polirely eorreer sueh misconcep»
nons. As for rhese who are simply borhered by rhe smell. I am
eerrain rhar Tom Crady would agree rhe oeoasional neighborly
annoyanee, arising from an enrrrely legal deed posing no heslrh
risk, as is. say. playing music a |' rle bu loudly. is a marrer ro be
handled by selfegevernance and irs channels, rarher rhan come
plainrs re rhe presidenr ofrhe college. i cerrainly wouldn'r :xpect
rhem ro disingenuously presenr unfounded supersririons as juxii»
ﬁcation for a smoking ban orherwise morivared by, l don'r know,
say, eoneerns abour rhe collcgc'x image.
