“When they come up with a new thing it s nhonr something that 5 very much
them and rings ofrheir personality rnther than ',Oh i know. I can do this really
cool nrove I lenrned in dance cl. -,"gnesr choreographer Celeste Miller snid or
Grinncllians during her stny here in February.

Between Hm and ’I‘lmu, rhe [heater dcparrmcnt’s spring dance production,
was a collaborative process. Three orrhe four pieces are enrirely new, erented
wholly for the speciﬁc strident performers. The fourth, Eni Drint Marty, was
performed only once before, by Hurley & Dancers, and in the future will ineors
poratc changes that the srndent perronners brought to it.

“Unlike a traditional play where rhe division otlnhnr is very clear — director,
performer, playwright , these roles circulate rn Various ways, director Shawn
wernrck snid. ller vision ofn socially conscious largely texts dprodnerion
brings us two works ofhei own and two works choreogmphcd by guests.

Each of the guest choreographers spent an intensive week and a half with
the student performers to etcnre their pieces. Miller'sAngr/rAmong Ur explores
ideas orrnith and spirittrnl presence. Incorporating everyday activities and world
events, the thine »rs recite hendlines while dancing.

Juanita Sua 4’s work is [11C only one that does not use led, and instead
implements voice. Dry 1, Day 2 elnllenges rhe dancers to represent themselves
in different ways with respect to their bodies.

The nature of its size forccs the movers to feel one anorhcr's presence, Ra-
heccn Taylor ‘08 said. “There are thirteen ofiis nnd there are points in the pro-
duction when we're all rushing back .rnd forth.”

All {our dnnces are contemporary. and our: is iniineneed by the 19605 Judson
Church Movement which brought dance back to the basic motions, like run—
ning nnd skipping.

The aim is authentic movement, which Miller deﬁnes as “movement thar is
deeply ingrained in bcing human rnd natural so it doesn't have the affccrntions
ofn pai‘ticulnr style like ballot or ja7.z nr invnnese.”

The ﬂexrhle manner in which this prodnrrion was erenred nnd performed
provided an opportunity for the student danccrs (0 rise rheir erentivi .“It's te-
ally exciting as a dancer to hrtvc the opportunity to interrupt the actt ,"Titylor
