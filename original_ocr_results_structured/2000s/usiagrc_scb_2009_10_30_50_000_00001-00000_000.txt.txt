BY MATTHEW BATCHTELL

This past Tuesday, the International student Organizer
tion (150) and the Office ofInternational Student Affairs
(015A) held a reception in the Spencer Grill to dedicate
the newly installed Gallery of Flags.

The project began as n collaboratrve effort, prrmarrly by
the Office oflnternational Student Affaiis, the Center fol
International Studies, and Student Activities, to celebrate
the diversity of Grinnell's student body.

tionality was determined on the basis of primary citizens
ship, although steps were taken to include dual citizens and
permanent residents within the United States,

“We want the [flag] gallery to be a visual portrait that
celebrates Grinnell's global diversity," said Director of
OISA Karen Edwards, in her introduction to the Flagging
National Identity forum, which was held after the dedica-
tion.

The Rosenfield Program, ISO and an number of facultyr
staffand students were also involved. Edwards spearheaded
the project, working over the summer to iron out the dc,
tails of the gallery.

Before the gallery could be assembled, two problems
had to be solved—how to define the term ‘nationality,' for
the purposes of display, and how to identify different nae
tionalities within the student body.

“[The] flag gallery is a visual representation by different
countries represented by students on campus," sard Presi-
dent of ISO Shivani Santold ’11, reading the dedication
plaque at the reception. “It is a source ofpride to be l'ecog»
nized and acknowledged to all students on campus, foreign
and domestic.”

international students make up nearly 12 percent of
Grinnell‘s student body, representing students from over
so different countries. Currently, there are 75 flags hang-
ing in the gallery, which are arranged alphabetically from
southwest to northeast. At the receptron, bookmarks were
