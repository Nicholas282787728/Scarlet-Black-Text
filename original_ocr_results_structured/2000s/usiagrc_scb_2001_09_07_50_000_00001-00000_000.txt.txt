Campus moves to change

by Kate Mannion

While many of ihe rcccnt physical
changes to the campus that occurred over
the summer moysecm unrelated, all these
changes are part of the college's Master
Plan, n vision ror how the campus wtll
chntigc over the span of many years.

Probably the most noticeahle change
made over th: summer was the demoli-
tion oFFell Housc to make room for the
new campus Welcome Center,

Frank Thomas, a crinnell graduate
(‘71) and the Administratlvc Coordina-
tor for community Relations and Cam—
pus Plan, Feels that the Welcome Center
will be useful for several reasons.

“[lt] gathers in one place several ads
rniuistrativc offices that work closely to»
gcthcr, This makes for more convemcno:
For students, Faculty, and StnFF to work
with the various oFﬁccs such as admis-
sion, financial aid and the registrar," said
Thomas.

Thomas also feels that the Welcome
Ccntcrwill serve as a tie bemoan the come
munity and the college. “This will be the
First huilding otits type created by either
the college ot the town and will allow
mztny visitors a place to arrive and receive
information about the college and some
about the city orcnnncll."

While the Welcome Center is being
built. the officts of the registrar and off-

in an attempt to curb excessive drinks
ing on the Grinncll College campus, stu.

dents to look out For each other 2nd in-
tcivcnc early to help anyone who seems
to be drinking dangerously.

The college is also changing its polls
cics on parties. and taking steps to adus
catc students about the drinking habits
ottheir peers and the legal liability ofatus
dents in nlcohol-tclztutl incidents.

At an open forum'rucsdny night, stuv
dent affairs deans Tom Crady, stcvc
Larson and Jennifer Krohn presented a
revicw of the alcohol situation on cam-
pus, beginning with the results ofa sur-
vey distrihutcd last March,

The survey found that while the av
cragc nuinhcr oftlrlnlu each student re»
ported having per week had decreased
since 1996, txccssiv: binge drinking (dc.
nncd as rive or more drinks in one sitting
for a man, and four or more drinks for a
woman) was on the me.

“We're seeing more students who are
hinge drinking more frequently, mid that's
alarming to us," said Lirson. “We’re con-
ccrncd about students drinking and kills
ing themselves "

In mo, 36 percent orstudene re-
ported having hinged in the last two
wcelts. In 1999, that number had risen
to 38 percent and in 2001, it hlt‘ll pets
cent. The national average for college
students is 44 percent,

“The lcvcl thnr vve saw last spring was
the highest I’ve seen since I’vc been here,"
said cmdy. who has been at Griuiicll tar
19 years,

collcgc administrators trying to can.
front the prohlcni round that they had a
wide spectrum of options cvarlahlc to
them.

At the extreme and or the spectrum
was the “three strikes, you're out" policy
now being used hy many large univcrsi»
ucs Administrators chosc instead to
adopt a tar loss puiutrvc policy.

“We ihiult our approach, for
Grinncll, is the ught approach," cmdy

airs staff urges students to help peers drink responsibly

said. “And that's not :i discipline-based

policy,"

However, the college is required by

redcral law to certify that it has a policy
against illicit alcohol consumption, If
found in violation ofrl-ic law, the college
would stand to lose all government fund-
ing, including the federal money that
