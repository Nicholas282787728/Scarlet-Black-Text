on an untraditional

path for most Grin-

After struggling for nearly two
years to obtain a visa so he could
attend Gi‘iniiell, it has taken Jing-
kan Cu from Shanghai. China only
four years stateside to live life like
an American.

He has a job he hopes will
make him rich, an appreciation for
expressing and hearing opinions
and, most importantly, knowledge

“I’ve learnt some unorthodox
words There a lot of words you
can use when you’re angry," he
mused. “That can be very helpful.”

While he at first felt a bit uns
easy about leaving China, within a
semester he began to feel comforts
able. ”Vth I came here I didn’t
know what I wanted to do. which I
think is very common with college
kids “’e don't know what we’re got
ing to do so we come to Grinnell."

He tried a variety or classes
from different disciplines before
deciding to take more “market
oriented” classes in the Economics
department, He was encouraged to
take some math courses, and before
he knew it, he realized he needed to
only take two more classes to com,
plete a Math major in addition to
Economics.

“In Grinnell,
if you don’t study,
you party, And
other than that
there‘s nothing
else that you can
do, So, I did a lot
ofstudying."

After he grade

management is “a
good combina-
tion or theory and practice. I’m a
very result-oriented person.

“That's why I don't do research
because 1 don’t see in the near future
that research will get me any kind or
results. At least while I’m still alive.
So I want to be involved in sortie-

“I don’t really care about mon-

career options
we have a bias
toward cateers
that will give us
a good life, as far
as money goes.”

However, in
true Grinnel-
lian spirit, Gu
said he doesn't
think money is
everything. "1 do believe that there's
something more than inst a good
material life. But people who don't
know me might say, you're just in—
terested in Ben anklin and green

Grinnell gave Cu at more une
orthodox view of the world. He

ideas here, where people can quest
tion one another and debate.

“In China what we learn is that
that history is a not. something
happened. it happened and so this
is what you need to know. This is
right and this is wrong and you are
going to be tested on it. Great. But
here my understanding of history
drastically changed

"I think history is more about
perspective than facts because not
body knows what happened... you
have an opportunity to get cxpoe
sure to lots of different perspectives.
You can make your own informed
judgment rather than get given an
answer.

However, Cu sometimes feels
more like an observer to what's
going on than a participant. One
day last year he walked into the
Forum and saw a crowd of excited
people. It was the Presidential :1“,
tion. He wondered what all the fuss
was about, because he didn't think
the election would have any enter
on the country. Now, however, “I
think a better alternative [to Bush]
could’ve make things in America a
little better."
