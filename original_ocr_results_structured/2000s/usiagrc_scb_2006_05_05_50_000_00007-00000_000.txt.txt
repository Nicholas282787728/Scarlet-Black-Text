Another voice for Alt Break

Alternative Break is quintessentially Griuneilian.
It creates a strong sense of community among stun
dent participants and promotes social justice. Despite
its contributions, the program still lacks full institu-
tiorralfunding. '

Due to policy changes in the Office of Alumni
Relations and Development, the stu-
dent organization Alternative Break
will no longer be able to solicit funds
from alumni.This was a major source
offunding.Witboutit,AltBreak may
face a budget deficit for 20084009.

Alt Break's binding in future years depends on
the Budget Committee, an organ of the Board of
Trustees, The Budget Committee allocates ﬁinds to
the community service Center’s
(CSC) base budget, which in turn
ﬁinds Alt Break.

Members othe Grinnell cnm- _
munity are already advocating to for full fund/ng.

Through publicforums in recent weeks, advocates
targeted both the nustees and the student body to
raise awareness and encourage action on the budget
shortfall. The editorial staﬂr of the SEER would like to
add its voice to those calling for full arnding.

grim. 1n student initiative voting, the student body
voiced its support for Alt Break with 90 percent of
voting students supporting the initiative to make Alt
Break a “budgetary priority."

Alt Break merits funding both because of its pop-

ularity and its mission. This year, Alt Break made it

' possible for 136 students to undertake

intensive service projects.The organi-

zation even had to turn 56 students

. _ _ ° away because of lack of space. A pro»

ﬁm giam that serves so many Grinnellians
deserves ﬁnancial support.

Also, Alt Break in 115 students with an under
standing of broader soual issues and with a tradition
ofservice.Tliese are impomrnt factors in the college's
mission of prepnﬁng students “to
use their knowledge and their
abilities to serve the common
good.” The program is important
in achieving Grinnell‘s mission.

Thanks to Alt Break, this year
alone students journeyed to Mississippi after Hurri-l
cane Katrina, to a’tescrvation in‘ the Four Comets re»
gion and to urban centers like the Twin Cities Future
classes should have these‘opportunities, too. We hope
that the Budget Committee will listen to the over-
whelming student support for Alt Break and provide

‘ full institutionalized funding for the program in the

next budget

Neoliberalism merits
critical investigation

Most among the readership of this paper do not
hail from countries that have had to impose austerity
measures on their public sectors in order to meet IMF
requirements to restructure national debt.

Surely none 0(y0il served in Paul Brenlcr’s Corali-
tion Provisional Authority, which opened Iraq's banks
and industries (the petroc
leunr industry excepted)
to control or ownership
by foreign companies
and dissolved barriers to ‘~
trade. Most of you prob-
ably shnke your heads in
disbelief at the liljlnks of _
Enron’s former chiefs but figure that it’sjusr typical of
America's corporate climate.

All of these seem remote, so you probably wonder
to youiself: what is neoliberalism
to mc>

Neoliberalism has more dcale
iiigs With you than you think.
Strictly speaking, the label neo-
liberalism describes both the
abandonment of Keynesian or
Keynesian-inﬂected state controls
ofnational economies and the dis-
mantling of social welfare safety
nets. Its most visible proponents may be the Third
World ncolyres or the Chicago school ofEconomics
(Milton Friedman, et Ill.),1l cabal that had more than
a great deal of inﬂuence in Chile, Mexico and other
points south.

Moving beyond the idea that private goods can be
obtained and even generated by a market so long as it
remains free of state interventions,two related proper
sitions distinguish neoliberalism from other strands
ofliberalism.

First, rather than keeping state and economy
asunder as in classical libs
eralism, the state is actu-
ally charged with the task
of creating or expanding
miirketsifor example, res
juvcnatmg the labor mar
ket by welfare reform.

Second, in fact the ef-
fectiveness of political institutions themselves can be
judged according to market rationalities: costrbenc
cfrt analyses, privatization of public services or public
trusts, outsourcing, willed lgntr
rnnce of negative externnlities nnd
so on.

As much as it might seem that
some of France’s (non-North/
