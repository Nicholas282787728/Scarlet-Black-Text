After a busy (but fun) four years,
Hanes will combine love of travel
and Russian in the Peace Corps

Ho hum, just another ordinary tour years oflibernl
arts education at Grinnell for Ben Hanes ‘05, who was
toreaptain or the Fiisbee team, organized Titular Head
and doublcrmajorcd in Russian and Music. His overt
tuie is being performed this weekend by the Grinnell
Olehestra. and three months after graduating he'll be
spending about two years with the Peace corps, most
likely somewhere in Eurasia. All that, and his ﬁnest
Giinnell memory was a pairy.

“We [the Ultimate Frisbee team] throw 10/10 in
the fall, which this year was just awesome," said Hanes.
“[This year's 10/10 is] probably going to be my finest
memory of Grinnelltjust the way that everyone eame
togethei and it was a ton of work but a lot of people
helped out. We got the
whole campus involved, Ben Hones
and itseemed like every
one had a good time." 3y J05 Gm

10/10, the annual
progressive party in honor of the ﬁrst student payday
of the year, is only one of a number of events organized
by the ultimate Frisbee team, which l—lanes has been on
since arriving at Grinnell and was eaptain of this year.
They also organized the Elephantitis 11 tournament,
which featured 20 teams. The Frisbee team goes on a
handful orroad tournaments every year as well.

“It’s inst a really awesome group of people," Hanes
said. “1 i great mix otphysieal aetivity but yet it doesn’t
take over your lire."

Hanes, who had played reereationally for two years
in high sehool (“We never played by the rules', it was
just chaos,”he said), found Frisbeeiiist as engaging, but
less time—consuming. than the school's varsity sports
teams. And less limercol‘isnn‘ilng
was good, given that Hones had to
halanee Frisbee with being on the
organizing committee for Titular
Head for his ﬁnal three years here
(this year he was the Titular Head)
and a double major in Russian and
Music

lrlaines started out as just a Rus-
sian major. made easier by a study
abroad program, but the Music ma-
jor was less thoroughly planned “I aetually surprised
inyselfiii declaring that but I'm definitely very happy I
did," he said.

l'llines plays trombone but focuses mostly on some
position and theory. The oiehestra is performing the
overture he more (or his senior music project with his

“I think that I like Russian composers and I have
a Russian major for the same reason," he said, “Some-
thing about character of the Russian artist appeals to
me My favoiite composer is Shostakovich [a Russian
Composed."

Hancs looks to continue composing on the side "as a
corollary to my caleer,”but his immediate future is rather
occupied Starting in the fall, Hanes will join the Peace
Corps for 27 months. While he
doesn’t know his etact destination
yet, he was nominated for either
Eastern Europe or Central Asia.

“It seemed like a good way to
buy some time,” said Hanes, “I‘ve
talked to people who have done the
Peace Corps, so I’m conﬁdent that
1 will find fulfillment in the type
of serviee work that I'll be doing,
It’s also appealing to spend two
years of my lite doing that work and their organize my
thoughts about what 1 want to do with the rest of my
life."

Hones plans to rmvel over the summer. After that,
he thinks he’s found an occupation that will make him
money until the fall or at least keep him busy.

“My plan is to make money by playing oiiline poker,”
he said. “We’ll see how that turns out though."
