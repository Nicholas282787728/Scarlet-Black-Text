Dems to “stay neutral"

Kerry, cant. from p. 4

“low voters are not as receptive to John Kerry as they were in
2004," she said. “The only reason he’s coming here is to test the
waters again for 2008."

The state Democratic Party spokesperson also spoke of
Kerry as if he were a candidate. A spokesperson declined to
comment in what they called “an effort to stay neutral" toward
possible presidential candidates. '

Trustees add a new member, give Osgood three more years

Wind turbines and project updates were the main agenda
items at this spring‘s trustee meeting, which concluded last SMF
Ui'day. .

David Bramnn '75 was elected as a new trustee. The Board
decided that the new swimming pool should be 50 meters iue
stead of the current pool’s ZSrmerer length bringing the ﬁeld’
house phase of the new athletic centei one step closer to getting
underway.

“We did not view this as a big decision mooting,"mplained
President Russell Osgood via 81113-11, "but rather as one in
which the Trustees would meet and hear updates from various
people."

Last Thursday, trustees gathered to hear a series ofsmdent
presentations on topics that students selectedThis was a change
from previous years when SGA hosted a Trustee open forum,
or even more recently, when select trustees made presentations
to the students followed by question and answer periods.

“We really thought this would complete the dialogue," said
SGA President John Bohman ’06, who planned The change
with Vice President Chris Ochoa '06.

 

ﬁt, This Week in Joini Board

' The meeting began with representatives from Emanatcl
seeking a solution to their show Friday having been doubler
booked with Ghost Face Killah. Ghost Face's show is to be
one of the biggest concerts in recent Grinnell concert history,
second only to last year's Cake show.

-Two nominees for next year's SGA cabinet were contest-
ed:

Snin Tang, nominee for Administrative Coordinator, whose
character and reliability were called into question by several
parties, is on leave this semester but, in a tense confronrar
tion, defended himself to the board over incoming SGA Vice
President Michael Billups’ cell phone. In the final vote, which
around halfthe board abstained trom,Tang was not approved
as AC.

Nick Blencowe, nominee for ACE Coordinator, was cone
rested due to some concern over the failure of the Drag Show
he had been organizing, but after briefdiscussion was unani‘
mously confirmed.

Slol'y reeptige 1)Osgood’s contract was also extended to coincide
with the completion of the strategic plan in 2011, adding three
years to his term.

The strategic plan, according to Osgood, remained the prir
mary agenda item. “The main [goal] is to continue vigorously
to move forward implementing the strategic plan," said Os-
good. He also added as a major goal “to finish off our building
projects." —Lc/tt Garcia

 

Ask the President

 

 

 

What opportunities do you as presi-
dent have for student interaction?
Which of these is your favorite?

The President has lots of opportunities for interaction
with students and many of them are superﬁcial so I prefer
interactions in which i get to know students better and they
can also feel more comformble talking with me. Specificallytl
Like to teach, in part because it promotes a more in-depth ‘in-
teracrionl also like to meet students one—on-one or in small
groups in my office or around the campus. I also like to deal
with students as they work either for my office or in other
campus jobs. Students are very diverse in their viewpoints
and their objectives and getting to know them is a great edu-
cation for me and helps me do a better job.
