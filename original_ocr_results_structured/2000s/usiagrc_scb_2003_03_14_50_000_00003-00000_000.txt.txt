was probably because bed largely publicised
the group among his friends, “The posters
were not exactly colorful or dramatic," he
said.

In the nexrrew weeks, the group hopes
to begin publre activities to educate
Grinnellians about the beneﬁrs ormilirary

least, events will remain lowekey

“I don't think anyone here is doctri-

For all his awareness or the challoges
SID races at crinnell, though, Jacobs sees
the group as more than just a voice ofdis»

“1 don't see this as a counter—cultural

How’s the
math work?

A clencal enor by Election
Board led to an intonect
announcement Sunday that
initiatives two and three had
failed. As a result there was
some confusion about the
math used to calculate the
results or student initiatives.
So lets run through it.

1) The conditions

To pass, an initiative needs
half the campus to vote, and
2/3 of those votes need to
be in avor. Present Not
Voting (th) counts as not
voting at all, and abstaining
counts as an opposinon. oh,
and there are 1095 students
eligible to vote,

2) The results

Let’s look at the first one as

an example. First ofall, 701

ballos were cast, but 96 of

them were PNV. And of those
cast, 377 were (or, Ian were
against, and 6E abstained,

3) The calculations
First of alt the ﬁrst

campus voted. You’ll
remember that PNV doesn't
count as voting.

ITS plans to replace WebMail
