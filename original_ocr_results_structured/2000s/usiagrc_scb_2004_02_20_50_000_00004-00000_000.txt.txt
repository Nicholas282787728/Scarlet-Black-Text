Fight 1' r onIr rights

A Grinnell High School student works with Grinnell College ACLU members to start a
chapter of the civil rights organization at the high school, meeting with some resistance

by Lauren Standifer

While many people see teenagers these days as apathetic and apoliti-
cal. Galen Andrews is out to change the stereonypes. Hes ﬁghting to get a
civil rights organization involved in his zmdemic community and more
high schoolers interested in the political world around them. Andrews IS 2
sophomore at Grinnell High School (GHS) who is determined to set up a
chapter or the American civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Despite opposl»
non anaong his peels and possibly the administration, Andrews is work»
ing with the ACLU chapter at Grinnell college to bring awareness or
polltlul issucs to the high school crowd.

The college’s ACLU chapter was set up two years ago and now rneec
weekly in Bob‘s to discuss political issues. Andrews saw posters advertising
the meetings while on campus. He had also learned about the ACLU the
year before in his American History class and was interested in joining the
group, so he began to atrend meetings on a regular basis.

According to Elizabeth Mallort ‘06, the co-leader or the college chap.
ten the idea to start a high school chapter wﬁ entirelyAndrews'. Andrews
wanted to start the chapter to “get kids more politially involved and get
more people to be aware or these issues," he said. There have also recently
been incidents at the high school that Andrews feels have challenged some
students tighu to free speech.

Andrews hopes to be able to rake up many issues once the chapter gets
going. He would like to addrcss the issue otabortion in light orthe fact
that there are some teen pregnaneits at the school, he said. The ACLU is
pro—choice and the organization took part in the Roe v. Wade case that led -
to the Supreme Court's decision that the right to an abortion is defended
under the constitution. Andrews would also like to address censorship
and raise awareness or the Patriot Act and all “the Bush political grbage
that’s going on." he said.

The process otsettrng up an organisation at GHS is rather lengthy, in
order to get the chapter, Andrews ﬁrst needed the support ora stairspon.
sor. English teacher Michelle Barker volunteered for the job. Andrews and

other students involved in the errors then circulated a petition. The peti—
tion they ﬁnally managed to turn in to administrators had the signatures
or24 students and tour teachers,

When thestudenrs completed the petition, they were told they needed
to prepare a report to Convince the school board an ACLU chapter would
be beneficial to the school and would tie into the curriculum. Andrews is
currently working on writing the report and believes he can tie theACLU
to many ditterent Subjects. including American history and government
and even American literature. because the organization has a history of
defending banned books in the us. After this stage is complete, Andrews
hopes they will ﬁnally be able to get the chapter going,

so far, cutting through all the red tape has not been easy due to oppo»
sitlan. While roost GHS teachers support the formation or air ACLU
chapter. Mallorrsaid. "the principal on too thrilled with the idea."

Members ofthe student body have also been blocking Andrews' at.
tempts. Some students tore up petitions or crossed out signatures and
wrote in take names instead, Andrews said. Additionally, several com.
pleted petitions simply “disappeared," he said. The petition that was in
nally completed and turned in was the firth or sixth copy.

When Andrews asks students why they are opposed to rhe group, he
said he “can't get a straight answer. Typically, daeyre really conservative
kids who would rather not see something like that at their high school. ’
However, Andrews believes the group does have a great deal orsupport on
campus and there will be many students interested in ioining the organi.
ration arrcr they learn more about it.

Andrcws has high hopes tor the ﬁltutc ofcivil liberties at his school,
He plans to set up a booth at a Diversity Alliance-sponsored event to
attract more members, and both Motion and Andrews hope that the col-
lege and high school chapters can work together on events in the future.
Both hope to work with GHS to get teenagers to be politiully awarc and
involved.
