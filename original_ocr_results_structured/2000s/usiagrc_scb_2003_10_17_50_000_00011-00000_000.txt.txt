CULTURE, Share pheros of your home,

seek our foreign srudeno who speak your rarger
language. Togerher you ran eomplain abour mo

you miss from rhe “home" oounrry.

HOLIDAYS. Breaks spenr ar Crinnell are of
ren lonely and boring. and sraying in rhe dorms
means foreign srudenrs miss our on some only
American experienees. offer ro rake your Indian
neighbor home wirh you for Thanksgiving or an.
orher break. Evplain whieh ever Ameriern holiday
