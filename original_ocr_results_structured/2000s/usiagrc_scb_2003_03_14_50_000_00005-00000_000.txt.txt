After being accepted .tt Grinliell with a scholorsbip that
met her full demonstrated need, Yang Zliang ’03 had her

student visa, She was denied at the ﬁrst window, metning
that she didn't even get through the doors orthe embassy.

nerve»\vrncking,

“Chinese students know going

Coordinator of International Ad-
missions, “I con only assume that
they know they’re walking on thin

it to the “bubble-man," or the issuing officer behind the
second window, but was rejected ogoin. She was reiccted
for the third time in August.

The most common reason that students are denied vi-
sas, according to the Embassy’s website, is that “we are not
convinced [l'mt [thestudent] has solid reasons to come back

“Each student gets a two to three minute interview,"

Zhang had to give up temporarily. “It's three strikes and
you're out," said stonb. “You con'r try ogain for another
