Basketball Pioneers are
the Team of the Future

BY KRAMER MCLUCKIE

Kramer's Rules (do you guys get the math joke, by the
way?) is usually dedicated to, in order, my narcissism and the
national sports scene. With my immense level of sports exn
pertise and training (I played middle school basketball and
I read ESPMmm frequently), I like to sound offon the same
issues as highlyepaid TV analysts like Lou Holtz, Dick Vi-
tale or (shudder) Charles Barkley, but with less ﬂorid idioms
and a better vocabulary. But with Valentine’s Day coming
up, I thought it was time to give some love to a couple of
cutie»pies rather than myself or a nationally-known athlete.
It’s time to give some credit to the purest form of col-
lege sports, Division HI, and send a valentine to the
Grinnell Men's Basketball team. And don’t worry—
this valentine doesn’t feature the Jonas Brothers.
Especially not Kevin.

It may seem anodcl time to choo-choo-choose
the Pioneers, since this has not been a marquee
year. Their record currently stands at 5-14 overall, ,
3-9 in Midwest Conference games with four such
games remaining, though only three by the time
we go to print. The Pioneers are, however, likely to
avoid last place in the conference as two ofthose ree
mainlng contests are against MWC cellar-dweller
Knox College (2—17). If those presumptive wins
aren't consolation enough for Grinnell basket»
ball fans, one need only, examine the Pio-

neets’ roster to ﬁnd a yet more optimistic KRAMER MCLUCKIE 12

picture. After having to replace the top
three scorers, John Grotberg, Bobby Long
and Davey Arsenault, all of which averaged more than 20
points a game, from last year's conference comhampionship
team, this year’s squad will lose only two seniors from its
197mm roster. The top six scorers will all return, includ
ing guards Grifﬁn Lentsch’13 (13.1 pg), Matt Skelley '12
(15,0 ppg) and Dylan Seelrnan'13 514.2 ppg>. With {or
midable offensive production from such young players, we
need only grab some plutonium from a corner drugstore and
hop in my Delorean to seethe 2011 Pioneers boisterously
celebrating their ch championship in Darby. I may be
wrong about the team’s overall success next seasoniwe may
have to hit as mph again and check out 2012, instead.

But I’m steadfast in my belief that next year will be fun to
watchThe balanced offense provided by the development of
so many young scorers, along with the offensive rebounding
of big men like Kale Knisley (5.1 tpg), will bring Grinnell
back to its rightﬁtl place as national scoring leader. My point

Jai’s Winter

in previewing next season before this one has even finished
is not to write off this season as a lost cause or in any way
denigrate the hard work put forth by all the players and the
coaching staff for so long. Rather, I think we, as a student
body, need to come out and support the men's team in their
last home game on Saturday, Feh 20 at 4 p.m. against Mons
month's Fightin' Scots in Darby Gymnasium. At Grinnell,
basketball is our sport. We have a strong winning tradition
despite academic standards, both for admissions and in the
classroom, that put much of the conference to shame, and
the team is featured in national media from time to
time for its highvscoring ways. If we can provide
the kind offan support that will make Darby the
toughest place to play in the Midwest, there’s no
limit (pun intended) to what they Pioneers can
accomplish. so let’s come out in droves on the

20th and cheer the Pioneers to victory.
Additionally, the Grinnell Women’s Bas-
ketball team has also had a tough season and
is deserving of out support—their last game is
the same day at 2 p.m., also against Monmouth.
Some possible ideas for signs to display at the game
include: “Fightin’ Sucks” (not derogatory—paci-
fist) and “Not Even a Safety School” (to encour-
a e the Scots to adopt better campus safety

.ractices). Finally, their slogan seems
o be “Monmouth—What college was
r cant to be,"which’begs the response,

Monmouth—What high school was
meant to be."

Ofarguably more global importance than Grinnell's up»
coming doubleeheader against Monmouth, the 2010 Winter
Olympics kick err this week in Vancouver 1, for one, am
excited to root on Team USA in such riveting events‘as
curling, speed skating and, my favorite, the biathlon. Home
Depot’s enthusiasm, however, seems to have faltered as it
has dropped its sponsorship of the Olympics this year, I’m
saddened that we will no longer hear the inspiring tales of
Home Depot employees past and present (Bode Miller)
winning Olympic gold

Lastly, I’d like to wish luck to the Grinnell Men’s and
Women's swimming and Diving teams, which will travel
to Appleton, Wisc. to compete for their respective 8th and
11th consecutive conference titles, I'm hoping they’ll throw
up the dynasty sign a la Jay-z after they take home the hard

ware.
