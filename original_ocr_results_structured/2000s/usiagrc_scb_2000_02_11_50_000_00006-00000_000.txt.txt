Love On The Run

By Zorko Milin
Staff Columnist

Here's rhe deal: you've gor 20 minures
ro come up wirh 100,000 deursehe marks
or gangsrers kill your riue love, Perfect
for Veday enrhusiasrs and she resr or us
alike, Rim LEI/l Run is an aggressively ro-
manrie antlrmmance, way more hip and
original rhan rhe srandard sugary offers

The film's muse, Lola, (Franka
Porcnrc), is a Berlin punk goddess wirh
eye.earehing blazing red hair, reason
enough ro insranrly rail in love wish her,
righr21i's nor just her edgy look- rhere is
an aurhenric wildness and riereeness
abour her, nor ro menrion rhe amazmg
physical siamina. She is rhe real woman
xena ranaries should be worshipping.

Mosr of rho ﬁlm is Lola defying rhe
laws of physics as she dashes madly
through rhe srreeis orrserlin. ls rliis bor-
Eng? Nor for a spin seeond. An hour and
a haliorpure adrenaline, ihis ulrra.iasr,
rapid.rire ﬁlm will grab you righr away
and u won'r ler go {or a miniire.

lr's dehnirely gor rhe look. Wirhour

' Movie Review: German ﬁlm takes MTV sensibilities to silver screen.

Tykwer, unmiseakably one proud MTV
baby, rakes rhe kind oimusie video rech-
niques rhar have become rhe riresome
hallmark ofAmcrican aerion movies and
reinvenrs ehem ro express Lola's srare or

The ﬁlm shows rhree successive Vere
sions orLola's race againsr rhe eloek, eaeh
wirh radieally different ourcomes resulr-
ing from various ehoin reaerions. The
ﬁlm's poinr sounds as irraken srraighr our
of ehaos rheory: Every second or every
day you're faced wirh a deeision rhar can
change your lifc. (The ﬁlm opens wirh a
brillianr image: a raee oi rime, an ugly
ape sraring back or you).

The grear rhing is how unemborrassed
Tykwer is aboue erearing a universe where

half as cure as she is, and l didn‘r care
