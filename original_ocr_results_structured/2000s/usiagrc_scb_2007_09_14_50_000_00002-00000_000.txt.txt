Temporary faculty fill needed roles

As professors in Art and History departments retire, take leave or go on sabbatical, term faculty adjust to life at Grinnel

BVJEFF RADERSTRONG

Last semester students we
learn of the early retirement of

bin, Art. McKibbin had been a part of Grine
nell’s taeulty since 1975 and was one of three
trill-time studio arr faculty memberswith her

gone, and another professor on

dio art department was left for this semester

wrth only one returning fullr
time professor.

To compensate for
McKibbln’s early retirement
and the yearlong leave of
Matt Kluber, Art, the col-
lege hired three temporary
faculty members, or “term
faculty.” A similar situation

partment, where two profeSr

sors resigned, three went on scholarly leave,

and one is spending a semeste

Washington DC. program, a total ofsix pros
fessors not reaching this semester. The college

had to hire several term History
course numbers up.
Looking at these departm

seem that the number of term faculty on cam
pus is particularly high this semester, but that

is no! the case “We are al—
ways hiring quite a few term
people," said Eliza Willis,
Political Science, and dean
of Faculty.

Currently, there are 25

compared to 22 last year. In the past seven
years, the number has hovered around 20, with

the most being 22 in 20034004.

Ultimately, the high concen

faculty in certain departments this semester is
due to a mixture of uncontrollable events like
late resignations and early retirements. “It’s
unfortunate timing," said Studio Art major
and member orthe Art SEPC Thomas Agran
'09. “But it’s only for a short while." Still, the

But for now, the high term faculty con,
centration in certain departments does add
to some level ofeonccrn among the students.
“[The Art department] always seems disorgar

new professors."

college is trying to prepare for future unanr
ticipated faculty changes. The Strategic Plan
calls for “leave-proofing,"which would require
departments to hire more tenured faculty than
required. This has been done in the Phys-
ics department, letting proressors go on leave
without needing to hire term faculty.
Leave—proofing is easy to do with scientific

Running, Art, was hired as a term faculty, but
now is on a tenure track, and Emna Zghal, Art,
hired as a term facility for one year, is planning
on applying for tenure.

Although tern. faculty have little Cxpcris
ence with Grinnell life, Swartz said they add
to the academic atmosphere. “There's an up-
side too," said Swartz. “They bring different
areas ofknowledge, diirerent areas ofscholarly
approaches and things like that.“
