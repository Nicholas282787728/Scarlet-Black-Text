Noise about
Noyce

New Noyce will offer cozier,
more accessible study venues

nrJotra BOTTLES

Eigth Avenue keeps changing — last year with the open-
ing of the Joe Rosentield '25 center, and more recently with
the uuvciIIng of the new addition to the Robert N. Noyce ‘49
Science Center. While construction continues on the westein
wings of Noyce, students and faculty alike are growing accuse
romed to this new take on old surroundings.

But even as Grinnell adjusts, Noyce construction is fat from
over. Currently, renovation is underway on the parts of the
building that were built in 1951 and 1954,1lnd Vice President
for Institutional Planning and Associate Dean of the College
Marci Soitor said that work will soon commence on the 1986
wing,

Sortor said the renovations to Noyce fit into a larger cams
pus plan devised in 1999, when members of the college com-
munity tried to anticipate everything from changing methods
of reaching to a growing onccampus student population. “You
really need to think about pretty much all of the new construc—
tion on Campus in the last almost 10 years as fitting into that
campus plan," Sortot explained.

With this plan in mind, the renovation of Noyce and the
construction of the Rosenﬁeld Center were designed as part
of an effort to integrate teaching and study space for student
use. This effort has resulted in a central meeting place for
Grinnellians in rhe form of a campus center and a science
building that encourages students across all disciplines to find a
study space where they feel comfortable.

Even in the early days of the semester, students can be
found in various study spaces around the building, experiments
ing with the new options. Sally Blatz Du Rivage ’08 said that
she appreciated the efforts to improve study space options on
campus “I come here now because there's so much room and
it’s so quiet. It’s a great place to study."

Michelle Manemann ’10 is impressed with the new addi-
tion to Noyce but has mixed feelings about the amount of time
the process took. “I’m deﬁnitely in favor of the construction,"
she said, but added,“I’m surprised at how slow it took .. . there’s
still a lot of things that need to be completed. But overall I’m
happy with the results."

Although ongoing construction presents some challenges
for snidents and faculty in Noyce, Dean of tl\c College Jim
Swattz said he is optimistic that the campus community will

embrace the changes. “I'm just hearing really, really positive
things from students and faculty members about rhe spaces as
they’re starting to really use them,” he said. Swartz added that
reclaiming the building is a process and that it will take time
for people to become completely comfortable with the renovac
tions.

Sortor remarked that while completion of the project is
neat, students and faculty need to bear with the construction
for a little longer. “We’re hoping to be done with that by the
end oftlie semester but we’ll just have to see,” she said. “These
sorts ofthings take their own time."
