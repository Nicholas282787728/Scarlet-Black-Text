Once Upon a Time' In Mexico (R)

B: Fervent followers ofsetB movie columns mn’t pos»
sibly forget my cutthroat condemnation of Robert
Rodriguez’s kiddie spy movie. Spy Kids (vol, 116 n, 9, Nov
16 2001): “Every movie should have a gun somewhere." it
seems Mr. Rodriguez is among my masses of followers,
and took my hmtdously uninformed opinion ro heart
when crafting his latest masterpiece, which has a beautiﬁll
guitar—gunfight within the ﬁrst five minutes and an un-
ending amount of blood and bomb blasts before the cur-
rain falls.

0m Upim a Time is actually Rodriguez’s third movie
about El Mariachi (Antonio Banderas), last seen in Do-
prwdo. it wasn't seen by me, but my ignorance oithe back
story didn’t hinder me watching this installment.

"El," the best grinfigiiter in Mexico, is hired by a ren-
egade CIA agent (Johnny Deppl to prevent a drug lord
(Willem Dafoe) from pretending to overthrow the Mexi-
can president. His best friend is Enrique Iglesias, and Salma
Hayek is his wife. but only in flashbacks Perhaps none of
this makes any sense to you—don't blame my public»
schoolrhued writing ability. the plot couldn't even have
made sense to the stars of the film. But that doesn’t mean
it’s a had movie.

I really do admire Rodriguez as a filmmaker, He makes
movies quire quicklyeMcvico is his second movie of the
year, after Spy Kid 30, a trilogy he ﬁnished during the
lime George Luus put out one 5W Wars movie. He does
nearly everything on his movies—he writes. direcis. pro»
duces, edits, photographs and scores music. All this ere.
ative curiositysatisfics me to the point ofhaving rather low
standards. Granted, this personal phenomenon makes as
much sense as this film’s plot, but I’m ailing them like I
see them. Mexico isn’t a Christmastime award winner. It is
so full or gunfights and other wholly fun momenrs rliat
thcstiltod pacingirhc ending will hit you beforcyou know
it—and lack of plot din be overlooked. 1de my talk about
Rodriguez doesn’t get you hot. then i should talk about
Johnny Depp, who’s almost as good here as he was in I’i—
Intel aft/7: Crrr‘bmti. His character's motivation may not
make sense, but few actors can fix bullfights with as much
class and believability as him.

K:Temporarlly ditch yourCalc review or that Brit‘l'iad
paper for one long contemplation on true homes and home.
ness. you hardcore fans of Captain Jack sparrow and the
notorious spy Mr. Cartel!

Spider (R)

B: This movie really eould be a Grinncll story: a man
(Ralph Fiennes) is released from an extended stay in a small.
insulatcd, medicated environment and forced to deal with
his alrerod perceptions of the world, while having severe
flashbacks to his childhood while back in his home town.

The only major difference is that our boy Ralph Wm in a
mental institution, not an institution of higher learning
(meaning that he was crazy before going to the institution
as opposed to us going crazy in the institution), and its a
movie, so there can be a lot of wicked ﬂashbacks to his
wicked upbringing, ruined by his widted parenu (Gabriel
Bytne and Miranda Richardson).

K: And direcred by the master ofthe wicked art. David
croncbcrg's Shivoxstill sends shivers down my spine with
his creepy creepy parasites and The Fly totally made my
high school bio labs quire distasteful. Croncnberg certainly
has a multipleelegged-cmtum fetish. He make films in»
termittently, but they tend to come out in such an amaz»
ingly good shape and Spider is no exception. And there is
Mr Schindler, not dictating lewnh names to his secretary,
bur instead pulsating desperately in the spider web or his
mind when his memory thrusts him back to his suppressed
childhood memories. Faithful to Freud, he was abused and
misused and had problems with women, whose roles are
played by one Richardson with three different believable
femme raiaic versions. This is an excellent movie about
mental illness that you should votrh whether you have
already gone mad or not.

The Big Lebowski (R)

B: If there ever were a movie {int didn’t need to be
reviewed. this would be that movie. You've all seen it, I’m
sure, Is that high praise, or just a damning indictment of
the films today's youth choose to watch.) It doesn't really
matter, because you're probably already halfway to the F0-
rum to get the "good" beanbugi

The Road Home (G)

K: You only need this movie and that crouching crack»
pot kung fu pseudo-epic in order to brag about the Far
East movie industry, or the lack thereof. Let’s see, there are
familiar faces: the direeror is Zhang Yimou, one of the
brightest leaders of the ﬁfth generation in Chinese film
history, the star is Zhang Ziyi; yes, she hopped from tree to
tree in the aforementioned Weird Pastures afTu/u Enddn»
gem! Special. There are exotic and/or hisrorioally signiﬁ-
cant situations, including the local custom and the Revo-
lution. The story begins with a ridiculous obsession With
traditional funeral rituals and moves on to a long ﬂash
back of a love story with the backdrop of none other than
‘fimou's famous conspicuous protest against the Cultural
Revolution. Virtually everything you drink you need to
know about China is in herel How convenient! Then again
1 warn you that my seemingly unfavorable review, together
with other ovenwhelmingly enthusiastic online reviews
about Asian movies, only serves to alert you to the fact that
we may applaud the great and the mediocre indiscriminat-
ingly when it comes to 'cxotic* things, and that you'd beta
ter go and see the movie for yourself, lfyoud like to see
and embrace Asian movies in general, there is some rally

B: One of Films Chair Rachael Dreyer‘s best innova-
tions I've noticed is playing finals week movies on mule
tiple days. it’s way better than her ”innovation” of only
playing two movies some weekends, bemuse it gives you
more varied chances to see these comfort ﬁlmsv Just re-
member to check your schedule before heading to Harris.

Monty Python's The Meaning of Life (R)

B: The final python movie is a series ofinoongruent
vignettes on the stages oflife, from birth to dead-i. Could've
as aptly been called The Meaning nrsot. This movie blew
my mind and perhaps other para ofmy body whenl first
saw it seven years ago, and still elicits a strong response in
several scenes. it also has several strong moral messages”
about sperm.

Double Indemnity (N R)

B: BillyWilder's classic film noirstars one ofthe classic

TheAdventures of Priscilla, Queen of the
