An Experiment in Truth

BY MAIA PATERSON

When I saw that a class enti«
tled ”Theologies of Nonviolence," I
was intrigued, Nonviolence always
seemed to be somethingl wasinto—
I am not a Competitive person, nor
am 1 big on hitting people or using
war as a way to solve problems. So,
I signed up thinking that I would
learn about some religions that also
believed fighting was wrong. Little
did Iknow what was instore for me.

Although I know that I still
have a long way to go before my
ideas and beliefs are truly shaped
and formed (can they evetreally be
fully developed 1), this semester has
been an eye opener, Through read—
ing the works of Gandhi, Day, Mer—
ton,Hanh, and King, andexploring

, their ideas through class discussion,
I have been challenged to rethink
_my whole moral system and life—
style.

Through learning about the
suffering in the world, l have come
to realize my position in the wider
sphere of humanity and realize that
I can either perpetuate the suffere
ing, or I can help to alleviate it by
accepting some of it myself. This
may sound like adaunting, impossi—
ble. self— righteous statement. but
through my interpretation of the
leaders we have read, particularly
Gandhi. this can also be seen as a
lilicrriring understanding.

The thing that hit me the hard«
est during this course was the read»
ing by Gandhi and his assertion
that life is really an “experiment in
“NIL."

Just because a person has der
sided to start out in one direction,
he/she is not required to stay the
course, but inriy change us his/ her
outlook changes. This is not an ex-
cuse {or sitting still, action is re«
quired. This view has been very
libemting for me.

This semester I have Found a
greater awareness of the suffering
that surrounds us, an understanding
that can he very depressing and
heavy. However, instead of feeling
immobilized and overwhelmed by
all the problems of the worldI I can
appreciate what I can do I have
come to the understanding that it is
important for me to do what l can,
be that not eating meat, being a
more responsible consumer (or
choosing not to consume as much),
or doing volunteer work.

Although these may seem like
petty ”solutions,” theyare things that
I can do now, and through them, I
hope to gain more insight into the
problems and my role in them, thus
cousing different ivoys in which l con
help change to emerge. My path nnd
wziys or ollcvinnng suffering will he
constantly modified, changed, nnd
improved with the more exposure
and understanding I have. Some—
thing that I have learned from all the
leaders we have read is that each
indiVidual must do what s/he can
with whats/he has fromwhere s/he is
at. However, with learning this les»
son, comes responsibility.

Once one is made aware of the
suffering in the world, there really is
no way for him/her, in good Corie
science, to ignore it, Martin Luther
King calls for the recognition that as
long as there is inyustice somewhere
in the world, there can be justice no

_ where.Through Lhiscry,King is call-

ing on people to realize rhe intercon-
nections of humanity and, to use a
catch phrase, act locally, think glo—
bally. This legitimizes King’s idea
that everyone can serve others
through his/her life,

Service knows iiocolot, income,
sex, age, erc. Service is an option
open to anyone, and necessary for

 

rlie survivnl of everyone. In this
mind home, all actions, regardless
oftlieirmogriitudeJioVeglobolcon-
sequences This iden can be en»
lighiening. in that even the srnoll
esi action ofgoodness and goodwill
may have n ripple eiiecr. However,
rhc same is due tor all violent ne.
nons.

Thus. Hanh's idea orrnindhil.
ness in all action is required. One
niusr be aware oirhe effects oflils/
her actions and take responsibility
for what s/he does, while realizing
that we all have :1 global inﬂuence.

Finally, I would just like to say
that this class has really had an
incredible impact not only on my
thinking and world view, but in my
actions and the way I see myseli'in
rclutioiiro others. lhnve given much
more consideration to my actiomi
beliefs, and thoughts and the ef—
fects they may have on others.
Through all the readings, I have
come to many understandings, as
mentioned above, that are very
empoweringfor me. My understand
ing, though admittedly limited, of
nonviolence and its proponents
makesa lot orscnsc to me, not only
in an ideological and spiritual way,
but also in a practical, “way to live
my life" Way.

 

We are constantly being astonished at the amazing discoveries in the
field of violence. I maintain that far more undreamt of and seemingly

impossible discoveries will be made in the field of nonviolence.
—Mohandes Gandhi

Standing up for truth is the greatest thing in
the world. This is the end of life. The end of
life is not to be happy. The end of life is not
to achieve pleasure and avoid pain. The end

of life is to do the will of God, come what

may.
