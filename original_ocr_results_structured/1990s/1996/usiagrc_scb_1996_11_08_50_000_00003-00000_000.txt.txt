Grinnell to experience the latest
concoctions by Stereolab Saturday

PRESS RELEASE

On Emeror Tomato Ketchup the new
album from ground breaking group
Stereolab, French born singer/lyricist
Laetitia Sadier is using her usual seduc-
tive tones to invert harmless enough
phrases about the world marketplace on
the song, “Anonymous Collective." The
dark rattle and hum that serves as the bed
for her musings gives the track a venal
glow, nightmares from some global
netherworld. Or maybe the song is just
another playful Stereolab skat. Such is the
mystery and beguiling charm of
Siereolab, who can do more with a Farﬁsa
Organ and a couple of droning chords
than most bands can with all noise levels
turned to ten.

Ever since group co-founders Tim
Gane and Laetitia met in 1988 (their first
Stereolab release was 1991) in France
when Tim was still a member of the left
ist band McCarthy, the duo has dedicated themselves. to a compelling body of work that crosses genres, but never
confuses the purity of their ethic. "I'm not into the kitsch element," Tim recently told Rolling Stone. "I'm more into
the futuristic side. the way orchestral big band music was crossed in the ‘60s with early electronic music - stuff that
was originally done for cynical, commercial reasons often resulted in some very strange combinations andjuxtapOr
sitions of sounds."

The‘ romantic and creative pannership ofTim and Laetitia is rounded out by a common sphere of inﬂuences. “I
wasjust a kid who listened to the radio alot," says Laetitia, who grew up in the suburbs of Paris, "I listened to bands
like Joy Division, The Cute, and McCarthy. I met Tim at a McCarthy show," Both Tim and Laetita also list German
art rockers Neu! as forerunners ofStereolab‘s experimental explorations. Tim, who started his own cassette label at
the age of 15, was looking for new ways to express some of his headier ideas about music when he met Laetitia.

They formed their own label, Duophonic Super 45’s. with Tim writing most of the music and Laetitia handling
the words. Her dissonant, cut and paste style of writing became an early trademark of the group, “I prefer to call it
a collage style," She says. Armed with lyrics that switch from the frivolous to the didactic, and Tim's furious
passion for musical cross-pollination, Stereolab soon were cutting their own swath of memorable, atmospheric
music. Their records were eventually released on the T00 Pure label in Europe with the LP's Switched On m,
and The Gr Plaved S ace-A ed Bachelor Pad Music being released under the Too Pure banner, But a ten inch
disk called "Super 45," was the first Stereolab record ever released, coming out in 1991 and available by mail-order
only on their own Duophonic label, They continued to hone their sound, with Tim feeling it was their first Too Pure

rclcase, “Super Electric," a four~track ten
inch single that started gaining them at-
lcnlion throughout Europe. “We still
play "Super Electric” at our shows to-
day,” he says. Britain’s inﬂuential maga-
zine Melody Makerpicked itas its single
of the week, Stereolab also did their first ‘
stage shows soon after the release ofthat
record, it was 1992's pop mutation, how-
ever, the spirited “John Cage
Bubblegum" that became the first
Stereolab classic. He also cites the criti-
cally acclaimed The—Groomspﬂ
Ave Bachelor Pad Music with it's 1950's
mood-music (and stereophonic test rer
cordings elements), as the pivotal album
in Stcreolab's early growth. "We were
getting a bit heaVier musically," he says.
Their first Elektra LP, 1993's ac-
claimed Transient Random-Noise Bursts
With Announcements made many Crite
ics’ year‘s best list. Thctr second Elektra release, Mar. Aniline utntet found Tim exploring his penchant for
droning chord progressions “I wanted to make ti record with the same three chords on that one," he says. “We made
about five tracks like that on Mars Audiac uiiitet playing around with those ideas." Spin magazine hailed the
record as another milestone for the group, saying: "Stcrcolab's appropriating approach works like blowpop charm.
Stirring sine waves fueled by Moog synthestzers and Vox organ ...exploring the stylistic collisions between the
noisy and melodic illspimttOnS, between the raw and the kooky,” Spin also pointed out that it is the uniqueness of
Laetitia's style that enables her to evoke dual iiicaning out of thy, didactic lyrics like : “How the economic cycle
tends to revolve," (from Mars Audiac uintct's "PingePong,”) and make them sound like, according to the magae
zine: “some sort of Burt Bacharach liurscry rhyme cha-cha-cha,"

While appreciating the l'ZtVeS, Tim says that the band purposely set up new challenges for themselves when
making the new album Emperor Tomato Ketchup. “A lot of the stuff we recorded in Chicago using a lot of the
electronic equipment from the 60‘s and 70‘s One of the ideas for this record was to use some loops from the old
jazz records ofthosc eras. I approach it with a rather simple idea like that and the songs go from there."

Says Tiin about his partner Lnetitta’s lyrical contributions to the new LP: “Our songs might have certain ideas
about where information comes from, but it always gets nilsmterpreted," he says. “Laetitia writes in a way that is an
exploration of things that lliay bc obsessmg her at the time. This can take many forms. Sometimes she is very
offended by things, Sometimes you cnii get this across in a song better than you can in a sound bite.” The irony of
Laetitia's near somnambulistic style is that it never fails to awaken the listener.
