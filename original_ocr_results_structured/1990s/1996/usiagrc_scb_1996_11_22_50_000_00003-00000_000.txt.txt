SGA

BY KARMI MATTSON

Tuesday, October 15lh. The SGA
Social Committee meets to discuss
themes for this year’s Winter Waltz,
which will be held on December
7th. Borrowing heavily from
Anderson’s Guide to Prom Hell. the
Committee suggested the following
themes:

Country I-Ioedown Waltz, com-
plete with a silo and cow balloons.
(Rejected-seemed too reminiscent
ofthat Final Prom episode of Saved
by the Bell.)

The Little Mermaid Waltz, with
a pink balloon octopus greeting
people at the door. (Rejected »not
enough people own formal scuba
gear.)

Valentine’s Sweetheart Waltz.
(Thought we‘d save 'lhat one for
spring.)

Barbie Dreamhouse Waltz. (I’m
not sure what our objections were
to this one. but it came in a close
second to...) ‘

This year‘s Waltz Theme...'405
Train Station Waltz. Don’t laugh;
this one is serious. The Committee
decided that rather than ﬁghting the
scenic decor of the Harris Center,
we should focus on what the Harris
Center actually looks like. It is sort
of a '405 train station if you stretch
a little and squint your eyes.
Maybe we should back up a bit.
For you new students out there who
are uninitiated into the World Of
Waltz (WOW), and for those ofyou
older students who have never been
conscious enough to realize, Waltz
is, well, this thing where we waltz.
Sort of. This year, due to student de»
mand, we will be playing a variety
of other music as well. so you will
also have the opportunity to "dance"
to swing to big band music in addi-

Come a Waltzing Matilda with me...

lion to the same old recording of
The Blue Danube. And you think
SGA isn‘t responsive to student
concerns...

There will also be lessons in
how to waltz and perform various
other dances, although don't let
your lack of Waltzing ability be a
big stressor on your life. Harris
gets pretty crowded that evening,
so you're not going to have room
for 21 lot of fancy dance steps.

I'd also like to clear up a very
malicious, false and nasty mmor
which seems to be spreading
through the first-year class. Seems
some folks out there are worried
about not having dates. Okay, I
know we all have very fond
memories of walking through the
Grand March at our high school
prom with some greaseball on our
arm, sporting a huge corsage, and
rolling our eyes at our mothers try-
ing to take photographs to haul out
at the next family reunion. Sufﬁce
it to say, that is not Waltz. Sorry.

I’d like to close with some Fun
Facts about Waltz, plagiarized
from Ins & Outs and my buddy
Chris Leonard, whol swear would
have given me permission in had
asked.

Number of people who can ac-
tually Waltz: 4 (the organizers)

Percentage of people who ace
tually make it to waltz after attend-
ing prewaltz parties: 75

Percentage of people having
bad prom ﬂashbacks: 99

Number of cross-dressers: 45 I

Number of students suddenly
homogenized by the phenomenon
of black evening Wear: 77o

Keep your eye on your mailbox
for your train ticket back to the
‘40:...

Beware of the Underarm Itch

The deodorant wanton

BY KURT ORZECK
Columnist

Ouch. As my friend infon'ncd me of his plans for the evening, flashes of
pain shot through my underarins. An irritated, dry iich found its way into my
armpits While my friend continued to speak, I inconspicuously dug my hand
into the bottom of my shirt. then slowly mufﬂed my fist in my armpit. Ah,
relief, I thought, as I scratched away at the itch. Even though I had learned
from numerous allergic reactions to poison ivy that surrendering to an itch
will only set you back another step in battle, at the time, the relief is
unmatchable.

My friend took notice of my preoccupation.

I switched deodorants earlier this week," i explained, trying to rectify the
fact that I hadn't caught a word of what he had been saying.

Never do that." my friend replied, "Your body can't handle the change.
You‘ll break out in rash for sure."

No kidding. Days before, my last stick of Sure Unsccntcd deodorant ran
out. The same day, I hiked over to the bookstore in order to replenish my
supply.

When I was reminded of the size of the hygienics aisle In the bookstore, a
bad premonition swept over me. Toothpaste,
chap stick, mouthwash. and every other phar-
maceutical item were cranuned into the comer
of one of the rows, Isauntered over to the small
shelf, and eagerly inspected the contents for
another stick of Sure. Lip gloss foot pow-
der deodorant. Indeed, the bookstore did
carry deodorant. What a relief. However, as I
glanced more closely at their stock, I saw that
they only canted one brand 7 Speed Stick.

There’s a sizeable difference between Sure
and Speed Stick, if you choose to take notice.
Speed Stick comes in amore boxlike form, thus
invoking a rougher, sharper feeling upon application. Sure, on the other hand,
is smooth and much more rounded. Both have dials at the bottom for increas
ing the length of the stick, both containers are predominantly white, both
brand names are in black lettering. Nonetheless, the 52.99 price tag affixed
to the Speed Stick product was a good buck more than what I usually pay for
Sure. Still, due to my need, I was forced to buy into the sole deodorant come
petitor in the bookstore. Didn‘t I learn not to make this mistake from Econ
nomics class last year? ' '

Needless to say, after a day or two ofSpeed Stick use: my underanns bee
gari to turn against me. They did whatever was in their power to react against
the change in deodorants. They reddened, peeled, cracked, and, worst ofall,
itched. After using Sure for the great majority of my teenage life, my tradi-
tionalist underarms were rebelling against this coup I had instigated.

For the rest of the week, I suffered for having made the switchover. In
classes, during meals, at work the scratching irritation under my arms pre-
vailed regardless of time, place, or company. The only time the itch could be
successfully doused was in the shower. There, I could expunge myself of the

As much as I craved Sure,
I simultaneously realized
that S we was also the
villain in this matter

vile stuff and consequently experience relief for a merciful five minutes.
Nevertheless, after the shower, I was only forced to reapply the deodorant.

After four agonizing days. my armpits had yet to become accustomed to
the changeover in deodorant brands. They continued to retaliate with full
force, gnashing at my body the best way they knew how. Soon enough, a
new grotesque transformation took place. As I went to scratch my under-
arms yet again, I felt something odd. As I studied the phenomenon more
closely, I realized what it was: small lumps. The rash had full broken out.

This morning, I decided that I had had enough. If] couldn't accept a
multitude of rash pimples as a reason to purchase a new stick of deodorant,
than I would never find a reason to. No longer could I wait for my body to
adjust to a new deodorant brand. As much as I craved Sure, I simulta-
neously realized that Sure was also the Villain in this matter. The brand had
successfully gained control of my body. Over the years, I had developed a
physical addiction to the brand. Now the withdrawal symptoms were be-
ginning to show.

I trotted over to the food store intown, itching to ﬁnd a solution to my
problem. I walked surely into the store, sure to obtain a new stick of Sure.
As I meandercd through the aisles, I could almost feel my underarms bleed.
The skin fell like it was separating, ﬂaking away. Then I reached the de-
odorzint section.

Wishfully, l surveyed what brands they
had in stock: Degree, Teen Spirit, and, of
course, more Speed Stick. And then, as I
panned right, Ifnund the treasure I had been
in pursuit of: Sure Regular. My underan'ns
squealed in glee at the sight. That was what
they wanted, their desire. Though it was
not the unscented kind I usually bought, it
hardly mattered at that point. I gladly pur-
chased a stick for $1.75 (and one-and-a-half
times as big as the Speed Stick bar, mind
you).

I left the store a happy boy. A bright
smile planted on my face, I couldn’t wait to return to my room and apply the
stuff. So I didn't. I opened the bag. withdrew the deodorant stick, and
removed the cover. As I walked back to the College. cars passing by, I stuck
the stick up my shirt, into the fold of my armpit. At first, the pain was even
worse. The combination of two dcodorants must have been too much for
my underarm. But then, relief. My armpit sighed in ecstasy; the rash pimples
vanished, the itching sensation dissolved. I did the same to the other armpit.

What incredible bliss. I looked up in the sky, where the gray clouds
parted and gave way to the bright sun. To my left, I heard birds chirping
merrily in unison. The chilly fall wind evaporated, and was replaced by a
blanket of warmness. Children danced gleefully on front lawns. Passing
townsfolk acknowledged my greetings and wished me a happy day.

Now, as I write this, I am in a state of post»re1ief. I can feel my body
returning to normal, after that half-hour of underarm elation. From all of
this. I have learned my lesson: hopefully, in reading this column, you will
never have to suffer the same consequences I did. In fact, I may just put
some more Sure on right now ijust for the hell of it.
