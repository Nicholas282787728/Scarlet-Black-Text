Petition challenges anti—discriminatory employment

On April 2nd, the Concerned Parents of Des Momes. the same
conservative Christian group which helped to oust tormer school board
member Jonathan Wilson, submitted a petition to the Des Moines school
board requesting that the board halt its nondiscrimination policy of
employment. The group claimed that the employment policy, which also
prohibits discrimination based on religion, marital status and national
origin, should be rescinded because it covers pedophiles and child molesters.

ln reaction to the initial petition, a student group has already collected
1,000 signatures in support of the current policy, and The Interfaith
Alliance oflowa is attempting to gather 1,000 more. Though the efforts of
students, parents and organizations to speak in favor of the current policy is
supported by groups suclias the Des Momes HumanRights commission. the
Des Moines Register reports that some students who have openly defended
the anti—discrimination policy have been harassed.

Roger Ferguson, husband of college President Pam Ferguson, and
lohn Shores of Des Monies talked this Week With Gov. Terry Btanstad
and members ofthe Iowa legislature to get state support for an lowmbased
airline. The airline would connect Des Moines with major metropolitan
areas which are currently difficult or impossible to reach directly. Blue—

according to the Des Moines Register. Also according to Register
sources, Branstad is in support of the idea The airline could provide non—
stop or onesstop service to cities such as New York, Los Angeles,
Washington, D.C,.San Francisco, Boston, Seattle, and Orlando. Seats
would be open to business and leisure passengers and rates might be lower
than maior airlines. Ferguson and others are only investigating the
