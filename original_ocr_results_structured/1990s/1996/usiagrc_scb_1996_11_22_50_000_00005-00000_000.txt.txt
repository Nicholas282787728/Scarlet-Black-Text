Virtually everyone wants as much per
sonal freedom as possible. Democrats and
Republicans alike. But, I want to draw the
line at freedoms I think cost too much, like
the freedom to own handguns or automatic
weapons. On the other hand, I think that
the government has no place in the bed
room, or in a woman’s body. Perhaps the
biggest difference between Republicans
and Democrats is that we want to use the
government to help people in need,
whether that means Social Security, Wel-
fare (both programs passed by Democrats
over Republican objections) or Afﬁrmative
Action. Republicans feel that government
interference is bad, and for the most part, I
agree. Butsometimesit's necessary. There
are some problems only government can
solve. Ithink that this idea is the heart of
the issue: Democrats want government to
have an active role in solving societal ills,
Republicans want government to be hands—
off.

One of my main objections to the Re-
publicans is that they have always been
great problem—spotters, but poor problems
solvers. You can’t throw a Frisbee in Con-
gress without hitting a Republican who
wants to tell you how bad ajob welfare or
Medicare is doing, but you’d be hard,
pressed to ﬁnd one who can tell you how
to make these programs work. Also, I’m
getting fed-up with Republican rhetoric.
Republicans will say, of programs like
welfare, “But, it didn‘t solve the problem!
We still have (poverty, racism,
etc)” In the real world, problems are set,
dom IODpercent solved. As James Carville
said, "There are still Nazis in the world:
does this mean We didn't really win World
War Two?” In the Vice-Presidential de»
bate, Jack Kemp (who we'll get back to)
said seven times “The economy is not
growing fast enough." The fact is, there is
almost no such thing as an economy that
is growing too fast, which means that no
matter how good a job we Democrats are
doing, some stuffed—shirt GOP blowhard
can say “But, it’s not good enough!“ We
could double the GNP every month. and
you could still say “We could be doing
better.” It’s enough to make you mad. isn’t
it?

I think another big difference between
Democrats and Republicans is how we see
the future. Republicans like Bob Dole see
a future like our pastiDOle wants America
to be like‘his hometown of Russell, Kan-
sas. For heterosexual white males, this
might be a good thing. But Dole never
pauses to think about how hard it was for
blacks. or women or homosexuals back in
his “good old days." As for myself, I like
to think of a traditional toast: “May the best
of your past be the worst of your future."
And] think it‘s possible. The general pub-
lic is becoming more and more progres-
sive every day. Issues that were taboo a
decade ago are becoming discussible.
What we need most right now is the cour-
age to face the real problems in America.
Drugs, gangs, poverty. poor education.
These are the problems we need to address,
not tax cuts or new slogans like ”Just Don’t
Do It.“ And I think that, as usual, Demo-
crats will spearhead the battle against these
social ills, just like we did when we took
on poverty in the 30s, or racism in the 605
and 705.

I think it bears noting that I hold no ill
will for Republicans. In my experience.
most Republicans truly love our country,
and want to do their part to improve it. The
problem is, they’ve got mistaken impres-
sions about how to help. And in many
cases, it’s not their fault, There’s so much
bad or misleading information out there,
if you didn't know better, you might be-
lieve things like “Bill Clinton increased
taxes on the middle class." (which he
didn't). 0r “Dole‘s plan will increase fed»
eral revenue and lift the burden of taxa-
tion off the backs of the middle-class." If
Kemp-Roth (a tax cut written by Jack
Kemp in the early 805 which was the key
stone in tnckle»down economics) is any in
dication, Dole’s tax cuts will help every
one but the middle-class. No one from the
Dole/Kemp campaign will say anything
about the tax cut. either. Kemp told a
Newsweek reporter, “You won‘t get that
information out of me.“ Do they sound
like people with something to hide? Yes,

Well. that’s what I think. I see Republir
cans as (for the most part) intelligent. goods
hearted individuals who are simply misA
take about what this country needs. It‘s
not that I think we Democrats have a mo-
nopoly on solutions, it’s just that we’re
closer to the solutions than they are.

Liberalism is not based on open-mindedness.
The evidence of this is that Gn'nnell»brand lib-
eralism only is a Concentrated form of “real-
world" liberal ism. One must only glance about
to see the type of opensmindedncssAonlydf-you-
agree-with-me present on this campus.

Many liberal voters think that they are dorng
what’s best for the nation. They really mean
well, and this is what the liberal politicians capir
talize on. Once politicians get people trying to
do what they think is best for the country, they
can justify their confiscation of people’s rights
“for the good of the country.”

There are several mechanisms by which this
can be caused. One of the favorite of modern
day liberals is class warfare. One of the over-
whelming facLs of life is that the poor and middle
class greatly outnumber the rich. This is due to
the pyramid structure of organizations, as well
as other things.

What liberals do is try to turn the poor and
middle class against the rich, because there are
fewer rich voters. They do this by increasing
the tax rate on the rich and fostering this over»
whelming anger people have with the upper
class. Another class war they foster is the em,
ployer versus employee. There are more em—
ployees than employers, so they can just go af-
ter the employee vote (Hmmm, wonder whom
the AFLCIO majorly funded this past year?).

Another class war is mothers versus the un-
born, The unborn don’t vote, and mothers do,
so ifyou have to murder two million kids a year
to keep the 60 million or so female abortionists
happy, well so be it. Another class war they
evoke is the minority/women versus white male
war. You may think this doesn’t fit with the rest
of my examples, seeing as how the majority is,
well, a majority, but the Voices against affirmar
tive action, etc. have been so silenced by the
cries of “bigot" and “racist" that the liberals
can afford to alienate the whites in order to
have a lock on the minority vote. This is cs~
pecially evident by how the NAACP has
treated Clarence Thomas. Thomas is probably
the highest ranking African American in the
nation, but he is conservative. so the NAACP
just rolls its eyes and wishes he would vanish.

The last part ofthe liberal paradigm is how
they actually capture these votes and cause this
class warfare. It is really simple. Liberalsjust
love creating rights out of thin air. The old
rights stated in the Constitution are not any
good for them because they are rights from
the government, whereas liberals like giving
people rights from other people. Have you
ever wondered why the ACLU stands for
American Civil Liberties Union, not Liberty?
(actually of course, it stands for Another
Commie-Liberal Unamerican. but that‘s beside
the point). Liberals (politicians, that is) don‘t
like the idea ofliberty. They would rather be
able to make up new liberties, because then
they are seen as the defender ofthese new lib-
erties (all of which lead to more government
power. rather than less, as the constitutional
liberties do). Some ofthese new liberties they
have created are:

The right to have ajob (not hold ajob, but
be given ajob if you don’t have one).

The right to earn a certain level of wage
(why should the employer have a say in how
much he pays? Just because it is his money
doesn‘t mean anything.)

The right not to have to take a polygraph
test to be hired to work (though this law doesn‘t
extend to govemmcntjobs, funny that!)

The right not to have radio stations give
preference to one political ideology over any
other (yep, the Fairness Doctrine, a bill de
signed to keep radio stations balanced in their
perspective. funny it doesn‘t apply to T.V.!)

The right to only be hired or ﬁred for spe-
cifically approved reasons.

The right to be taken care ofby the govern-
ment ifyou refuse to take care of yourself.

The right to have medical insurance (yah,I
bet Madison thought that this should have been
included in the constitution, but itjust got left
out by mistake!)

And a whole host of others that handcuff
and suffocate a speciﬁc minority that liberals
feel they can sacrifice, the end result of which
is to remove individual rights and individual
responsibilities and place them, you guessed
it, in the hands of the government. I agree,
most of the above statements sound like they
would benefit the majority of people, but they
all disproportionately shackle the people to do
so.

Liberal politicians believe (and coax vot-
crs into thinking) that it is okay to attack cerr
tain people and institutions. wresting them of
their rights, to do what they think is good.
There is a certain arrogance to this, This arro-
gance is not confined to Washington, It is an
arrogance easily seen every day on this cam-
pus in the dining halls, where people steal food,
not thinking that it is stealing, and not think»
ing that it is wrong.

 

ASK IGGY!

It’s a crazy and confusing world out there and every once in a
while we all need answers. So here you go. This is the ﬁrst ofﬁcial
installment of your own personal Grinnell version of a question/
answer. commentary/critique column for the campus and commu-
nity, t'm envisioning this to be a DearAbby sort ofthing, although
I have heard a rumor that she’s dead. If that is the case then this will
be more of an Ann Landers type ofthing, unless she also is dead in
which case I should soon be in global syndication.

A friend asked what my qualiﬁcations were for this sort of pure
suit and I‘ll tell you honestly her response to my answer was, “Those
are the worst qualifications I have ever heard.“
grammatically correct rebuttal I thought that being a senior and a
philosophy major with a desire to write a column like this actually
over-qualified me. Well, in any event, I've been told that I’m full
of many things and good advice might even be one of them.

The best part of this entire column dcal is that you can use those

To the Campus Community:

We, the members and friends of Christian
Voices. a liberal Christian discussion group on
campus. want to afﬁnn the acceptance of ho-
mosexuality in die Christian church. While the
IVCF has taken a position mat does not explicr
itly condemn homosexual members or homoz
sexuality in general, the assenion that group leadr
ers must view homosexuality as sinful leads to
such an understanding. As persons created in
the Image of God. homosexual as well as heir
erosexual Christians deserve full participation
in the Church of God. Furthermore, we believe
that treating homosexuality as a sin is not an un-
questionable mandate of the Christian scriptures.

The biblical basis for judging homosexuality
is inconclusive, Arguably, nine verses refer to
same sex intercourse and when these verses are
taken in correct context and translation, none
refer to loving, monogamous, homosexual rela
tionships. Jesus, On whose teachings Christian-
ity is based. never referred to homosexuality and
he continually preached love and acceptance of
people who his society saw as outcasts. It is
difficult then, for us to acknowledge that Jesus
would have treated GLBT people with anything
other than love and acceptance.

We acknowledge the fact that all Christians
base their faith on a fundamental belief in the
history and spirituality of l esus and also that we
are all reading the same Bible and it saddens us
all to see issues divide not only noanhristians
from die Christians on this campus but also the
Christians amongst themselves. However, it is
also part of our calling as Christians and sup-
porters of the move toward equality within the
institution of the church to stand up against what
we feel is an injustice. InterVarsity’s stance on
homosexuality has hurt, offended and disillu-
sioned many students. We have seen this not
only among snidents who are not Christians but
also among those are Christians and now are
questioning why they are if the Bible can be in
terpreted in a way which we feel justiﬁes judg
ment and inequality.

Homophobia is not a Value condoned by
Christianity. Homophobia is a societal disease
and Christianity has searched long and hard to
ﬁnd the nine verses which can bc'used to per
petuate it. We, the undersigned, will not cons
tinue to pick out nine verses which can lead to
hateful judgments but, instead, will promote the
thousands of other verses which proclaim love,
respect and above all, acceptance.

To the Editor and campus community:

Over the past few weeks, InterVarsity
Christian Fellowship (IVCF) has been deal-
ing with issues of Homosexuality and Chris-
tianity. The leadership feels that “homosexu-
als are not living in submission to the au-
thor'ity of the scriptures” - to quote one
leader. In other words, according to their
interpretation of the Bible, a homosexual
lifestyle is sinful. I respect this opinion, al-
though I disagree with it. Just because the
leadership says this does not mean every»
one in the organization agrees with this P0,
sition. Yet in our disagreement. we remain
united by the saving grace of the Lord Jesus
Christn We are a family.

Can GLBT people be open and still be
Christian’.7 Yes, in my opinion. Can GLBT
people be sexually active and still call them-
selves Christians? Yes, as long as those
people are in committed relationships with
one another. The same biblical principles
that apply to heterosexuals, whether they are
married or not. also apply to GLBT people.

Iknow several open Christians. They are
not promiscuous, they are committed Chris-
tians. I know for a fact that their personal
relationships with Christ are just as deep or
even deeper than many heterosexual Chris~
tians that I know.

In my life, I have seen within the Afri-
can-American church, GLB people being the
ones that have kept Christ’s message alive
to a large majority of AfricanrAmericans in
the country (with God’s grace). This is not
to say that all African—American churches are
tolerant and affirming of GLB people, be-
cause many are not. What I am trying to say
is that GLB people have often been the back
bone of the AfricanrAmerican church.

In closure, Christianity is not about cons
demning GLET people to a life of hell or to
Hell, as many have done, but it is instead, in
the words of Max Lucado, “a desire and ef»
fort to see Jesus . . . a man who called him»
self the Son of God."

This is not an official statement from
IVCF, this is only a differing opinion from
an active member.

Dear Editor:
We are writing in response to the article

. published last Friday. November 15, concem-

ing the encouraged resignation of an unnamed
officer of the InterVarsity Christian Fellow—
ship because she or he would not take an ac-
tive stance against homosexuality. As four
Queer Feminists from Christian backgrounds.
we were personally offended by the actions
of the individuals within the InterVarsity
Christian Fellowship that challenge the co—
existence of our sexualities and spiritualities.

We stand against institutionalized
heterosexism and homophobia wherever it
exists, and recognize that it contributes to hate
crimes towards and degradation of Queer
people. The reluctance of the Grinnell Col-
lege InterVarsity Christian Fellowship to chal-
lenge the homophobic position of their na-
tional organization saddens, disappoints and
angers us. The Grinnell College community
has made great efforts to foster an open and
affirming environment for Queer people. The
recent actions of the InterVarsity Christian
Fellowship are a stop in the wrong direction.

Signed.

Dear Campus Community,

'As a heterosexual Christian at Grinnell Col-
lege, I am compelled to respond to the dismissal
of an InterVarsity Christian Fellowship leader

~ over her views regarding homosexuality.

It is disturbing for me, as a Christian and as
a member ofthe Grinnell College community,
to witness this leadership change because of
her view that homosexuality is not a sin. I wish
to state at the very beginning that I understand
InterVai-sity is working out of their understand-

ing of love and faith, not out of hate or spite. I
write not to condemn InterVarsity, but to grieve
with and reply to their recent actions. Iprepose
below several affirmations that, I believe. are
more central to the teachings of the Christian
Faith.

Ibelievc that the actual sin described by' the
Christian Scriptures is not homosexual behav-
ior in itself but rather homophobia and hatred
of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transsexual
(GLBT) persons. The Bible, as I understand
it, does not treat homosexuality as a signiﬁ4
cant topic in any book. Contrary to the state-
ment made by InterVarsity, there is no passage
Within Christian Scripture that calls upon the
church to dismiss homosexual leaders.

The passage quoted by members, I
Corinthians 5, refers explictly to an unhealthy
heterosexual relationship, not to ahomosexual
one. References in I Corinthians 6 to same-
sex activity, when studied, seem to refer to male
child prostitution, not to committed, healthy
sameasex relationships. Similar problerrts ex-
ist for all other Christian Scripture references
to homosexuality. -

0f the (arguably) nine passages that dea
with same-sex sexual activity. not one of them
refers explicitly to healthy, committed same-
sex relationships, Rather it seems that homo-
sexual relationships, like heterosexual ones, are
morally neutraliit is the content not the form
of a relationship that detem'tines its moral va-
lidity.

At best, it can be said that the Bible does
not speak directly to this issue. Ignoring proper
contextual and historical evidence in this re-
gard is shortssighted indeed.

While InterVarsity has taken a position that
does not explicitly condemn homosexual mem-
bers or homosexuality in general, the assertion
that group leaders must view homosexuality
as sinful leads to such an understanding. As
persons created in the Image of God, homo—
sexual as Well as heterosexual Christians de-
serve full participation in the Church of God.

I affirm that the recent action taken by
InterVarsity is symptomatic of a deeper prob-
lem within some strains of conservative reli-
gion. namely the rigid and narrow idolization
of (English) translations of Scripture and lack
of accurate and deep reﬂection on the true way
of religiousjustjce and love for all creation. It
is a similar View of Scripture that serves to
perpetuate sexism within the church, and deny
that human sexuality is a gift from God,

Finally, to those persons who follow a spiri—
tual and/or religious belief, I urge that prayers
or thoughts be held over the growing division
on this campus. for the confrontational and
schismatic nature of this and other controver-
sies this semester, and especially towards the
reconciliation of all those at Grinnell College,

Sincerely,

Chad Herring '97
