Grinnell’s African art
collection goes public

BY LESLIE MADSEN
Arts Editor

This spring, the Art Department offers an exciting opportunity for
students enrolled in Fundamentals of Exhibition Practice (Art 253).
This year’s topic is “African Art in the Grinnell College Collection.”
The department hopes to attract students from diverse backgrounds,

Students who have taken either Art 103 or any course on Africa
may sign up for the class. According to literature supplied by the Art
Department, the exhibition seminar is designed to be interdisciplinary;
students will learn the anthropological. historical, aesthetic and other
cultural backgrounds of the pieces in the college‘s African Art collec~
tion.

During the past few years. the college hired Christopher Roy, then
a curator at the University of
Iowa, to assess the college's col
lection. According to Professor
Susan Strauber, Mr. Roy declared
some of the pieces to be authentic
and others to have been manufac-
tured primarily for tourists and
outsiders.

Next semester, Vicki Rovinc,
the current Curator of the Arts of
Africa, Oceania. and the Ameri-
cas at the Univeristy of Iowa Mu-
seum ofArt. will lead students in
researching cataloging and pre-
senting the pieces in the college’s
collection. Students will not only
prepare wall labels and a cata-
logue for the exhibition. but will
also give gallery talks. The ex-
hibit is scheduled for Commence-
ment week.

Some objects in the college’s
collection are already on display
on the terraced area below the
Black Library on the second floor
of Burling Library. Professor

Strauber and Kay Jenkins of the Burling Print Study Room described
the items on display there as some of the finest pieces in the collec-
tion.

However, the college has several other notable pieces as well. Stu-
dents will study about sixty items, some of which are made by the
Leele, Kuba, Tsheva, Kwese and Chokwe peoples of Zaire. the Mende
of Sierra Leone, the Pende and Holo of Angola and the Bamana of

Mali. The collection includes
masks, a stool. ceremonial staffs,
fly Whisks. pipes, a diviner‘s rub-
bing oracle and drums, among
other objects.

The collection consists of do~
nations made by alumni and
friends of the college over a per
riod of years. Ms. Jenkins said
the objects are all nineteenth and
twentieth century creations.

Professor Strauber expressed
her delight with the opportunity
provided to Grinnell students next
semester. Ms. Rovine has extene
sive experience as a museum cu—
rator. In light of the instructor's
expertise and the variety of ob
jects in the collection, the Art De
partment heralds the class as an
experience that will provide some
excellent “introductory museum

experiences for students thinking about museum or gallery careers."

‘The Asphalt Jungle’ is
cliched but fun ﬁlm-noir

BY DAVID REED
Film Critic

John Huston directed The Asphalt
Juligle,nmovic aboutabig heist and
its subsequent untavchng, Sterling
Hayden portrays “Dicks" Snndly, a
small time hooligan recruited by
Erwin Reigschnelder (Sam Jaffc), ti
criminal genius, to take part in the
heist of the Bell of Tears. Dicks
needed the money he would receive
from thejob to move out of the city
and back to a horse farm in Kentucky
that his family used to own,
Reigschncidcr made the plans to
steal thJCWCIS before he chlloytll
and, now that he was free, planned
to perform the theft. With the fln‘r'lrtCr
ing of a crooked lawyer nntned
Emerick, the theft went its pin n
Ofcourse. things do no erri‘a’tﬁthat
simple, The film follows the fates
of the various participants in the
heist.

The film portrays a typical “hard-
boiled" world where all the men are
tough and the women blindly follow
them. Dicks‘s talents even extend to
the allrimportant ability to light a
match with his thumb, The film cone
tains many more c1ichés ofthc genre.
It has the hooligan, the crooked cop,
the sleazy bookie, the upright com-
missioner and even the “ditzy
blonde.” If such movies appeal to
you, you might enjoy this one.

John Huston adds some complex

ity to the film. He spends some of
the movre examining the dreams of
the men who participate in the heist
Huston humanizcs the crooks by giv-
ing the audience insrght into the char-
acters, Even il'mnny of the charlie
ters are cliche’, Huston adds a twist
to most of them, The continuous
theme of the movie involves the
men’s tlesirc to get out of the “as
phaltjunglc" and get some fresh air.
The methods they choose to try to
get out prove to be their downfall.
The Asphalt Jungle plays in the Fo-

Dvorachek’s ‘Scar Relief

ifrom “Heal” by Sarah King

Scar RCllL‘f, an exhlbtt ofartwork by senior Dorothy Dvorachek, accom-
pnttied by poetry by juntot Sarah King, is currently on display in the Forum
Terrace Gnllciy The show runs through next Friday.

Dvorachek explained that her works’ “driving force...hzis been...to try
and deal with mental illness and discuss it openly" Hence the title, which
Dvorachek explores oti ‘tl number of levels. “Relief" assumes a number of
meanings, both emotional and physical,

 

PHOOT KELLEY WAGERS

Dorothy Dvoraclzek': Scar Relief is in the Forum Gallery.

 

In some pieces, Dvorachek draws connections between scar relief and a
very physical “topographical relief.” For example, in Pill Chain, a piece of
clothwork, the viewer follows a very tactile tangle of stitches. buttons, and
verses across a translucent plane. Dvornchek expressed her wish for the
viewer to spend time studying the work and said the piece was open to
interpretation, btit emphasized that Pill Chain reﬂects on those times when
a pill is "the period that ends all the sentences."

Dvoraclieck iiistsls the viewer seek to discover the progression of the
pieces in the exhibit. They tell “a larger story" than their individual tales,
she explained. Part of this story is illumined by the verses of Dvorchek's
mother and by King. Dvorachek's mother writes. of a season “that..,was
loss and liopless / Buses left in the middle ofthe night lNight went to streets
in cities far away," Dvoraclick expresses the tensions between mother and
daughter in Barrage, which is coupled with “August to December 1995:
Season of Layered Sky,“ hei mother’s poem, which explains the “seasonl
did not want to see / Her cold eyes twitching lips wild hands / Like geese
strntlcd panicked iii the living room?v '

Dvornchck discussed biiclly the process of making a space for herself,
exploring relationships among people. arid creating a home. In ScarNest, a
plaslcr cast, Dvorachek CIllpliZtSlZeS that “you can create a home in your
scars. . Oryou have lo,because they're what you find."
