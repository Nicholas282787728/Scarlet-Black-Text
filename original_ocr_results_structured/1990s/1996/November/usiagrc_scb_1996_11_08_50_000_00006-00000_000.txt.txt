Performance a culmination of thirteen years of playing ﬂute

BY LESLIE MADSEN
Arts Editor

Sarah Moore ‘97 will perform a flute
recital tomorrow in Herrick at 8 pm.
All members of the college are invited
to attend.

As a child, Moore was “fascinated”
by the recitals hosted by her next-door
neighbor. a woman who played flute.
Even more exciting to the young Moore
was the fact that the director of these
recitals changed dresses between
pieces. Moore sensed a kind of glam-
our in this: “I thought beautiful women
played the ﬂute," she explained, admitr
[ing that this is a decidedly
“nonfeminist View."

When someone came to her school
to promote instrumental music, Moore
jumped at the chance to play the flute.
Her parents, who forbade the fourth-
grader to take up any string instrument
because they envisioned months of
whining violin practice sessions, sup-
ported her decision

Moore was entirely dedicated to her
flute studies as (I child, and even now,
after thirteen years of playing, she
spends at least fifteen hours a week
with “her," as Moore refers to the in

Moore has slutllcd at Gi-tnnell with
Claudia Anderson. but has also been
under the tutelage of several other lliiic
players both here and iii her home state
of Colorado.

lBabel’s ‘Sundown’ lgoes up tonight

In rehearsal since the beginning of the semester, the
Grinnell Theater Department‘s production of Isaak
Babel’s Sundown will ﬁnally open tonight at 8 pm. in

The play depicts the struggles of a family living in
1913 Russia, and is directed by renowned Russian di-
rector Veniamin Smekhov. All of Smekhov's direc-
tion had to be translated on the spot, making prepro-
duction more drawnrout than it otherwise would have
been. The only spoken Russian in the play, however.
comes in the forrn ofa traditional song intoned pCrlr

“Rehearsal has been a really long and difficult pro
cess," said Sara Shives ‘97. tlte play's stage manager.
“My initial reaction to this play going up is relief"

However, working with a director from a noancslr
ern background has proved rewarding to both Shives
and Michele Host ‘97, a cast member. “We've been
ablolto experience new acting styles, new, directing
styles, and new ways of interpretting a text," said Host.

“I’ve learned an entirely new method of theatrical
production through working with Smekhov," said
Shives. “I’m a lot more ﬂexible now in that sense."

Of Tofu and Terrorists

BY DAVID RUDEL
Columnist

Well, so many major events have come to a
close as ofthis writing. The ASIA ﬁasco is over,
the guilty havc been lynched twtce, there are
currettt investigations as to how students who
were so utterly tainted in mind and soul could
be allowed on campus, let alone admitted, and
a memorial is being planned to commemorate
the pnm caused by this vile piece of thought
crime turned corporeal,

ASIA has given us their definition of Racist,
and, with the apprehension of Bert and Ernie,
we think we finally got them all. The elections
are now also over, the outcome a bit drawish:
won two in the senate, lost ten in the house
showed once again that the media always skews
polls against Republicans (16 point lead,
pshaw !),ended preferential treatment In Califorr
nia and so now we can settle back and contemr
plate the next notrsorlogical topic: Hostage ne-
gotiating.

This sort of issue, like pretty much all the
rest, is pretty simple for me. Terrorists have
desires, and if they think that their wishes will
be fulfilled, thcy hijack planes, etc. and wait to

have their dreams fulfilled.

There is a segment of the population who
thinks we should just bow doWn to the tenor-
ists, give them what they want, get our prized
citizens back and call it a day. They are gener—
ally the same people who don't mind the gov-
ernment taking massive chunks out of theirpay-
checks, being lulled into the belief that its all
worth it for all the wonderful things the govern»
ment docs for them.

Let me move a bit away from this subject
and ask you if you think that the government
should have the right to force you to give to a
certain charity. Let‘s pick some deserving non—
profit organization, like the Heritage Founda-
tion.

Do you think that the government should
force you and every othcrAmerican to contrib-
ute to this foundation? Chances are the readers
of this column would rather contribute to the

Society for the Ethical Treatment of Marshmal-
lows railter than give their money to the Heritage
foundation.

So, with that in mind, I think one can make a
case for the government really not doing right by
its citizens when it conceeds to terrorist groups.
This action can be considered a forced charity on
the American people.

Ofcourse, Clinton probably doesn’t mind send—
ing money overseas; it will probably just make it
back to his campaign fund anyway, but that should
hardly be enough reason for you and me agree to
the practice. Even when the issue isn‘t money, it
still does not behoove the U.S. to give in to ten'olsls,
Whenever we bow down to terrorists, it only causes
more griefdown the road.

“So," you may ask, “what should we do?" Well,
I think the answer varies depending upon how
much knowledge we have about the group.

If we don’t know who they are, from where they
hall or for whom they are working, mayjust have
to resort to sending them mushroom cutlets mixed
with the 72 versions of Tofu Surprise served at
Quad.

AnyWay, if we wanted to stay Within the guide—
lines of the Geneva Convention (I am sure send-
ing rice croquets would get us in trouble with the
U.N., wait, we are the U.N....), the simple solution
would be to punish them in any way possible.

We have spent years building up to take on Rus-
sia: we oughita be able to take out some upstart
from a nation whose literacy rate is about as high
as the standards of our public education system.
We should also punish their parent country (if we
know what it is).

I know many of the readers don‘t like being all
mean and brutish about these things, thinking that
people who hijack planes and bomb buildings are
either victims of society or part of Rush
Limbaugh’s secret army, but the simple fact is that
acts of terrorism should be treated as declarations
of war. We have to get a single message out to the
rest of the world:

Mess with the best and you‘ll die like the rest!

BY BEN PATRICK
Columnist

From the Olympic Park bombing this year to
the Oklahoma City bombing In 1992, terrorism
appears to be on the rise. Nations are faced with
the question: should we negotiate with terror
ists?

First, we need to ask: what makes people
commit terrorist aCIS7 Simply understanding
this question goes a long way towards justify-
ing negotiating with terrorists. Terrorism starts
when a group feels persecuted, either by the
government or by the general public. In every
case, such groups ﬁrst try peaceful means of
protest. However, when these protests are ig-
nored, or in some cases brutally suppressed, the
group has little alternative but to turn to vio-
lence. Thus, bombs take the place of protests.
If we start by acknowledging that all terrorists
would prefer using nonviolent means if they
would solve the problem, then negotiation seems
the only logical path to take when dealing with
terrorists. Additionally, we need to recognize
that at the root of all terrorist actions is a per-
ceived injustice (inﬂicted upon the
terrorists), and that as such, we can
expect the terrorist activities to con-
tinue until the injustice is rectified.
Therefore, negotiation is the only
real solution to the problem of ter-
rorism, Additionally, it must be
noted that the term “terrorist" is it
selfa Construction. People we might
call terrorists, others call freedom fighters or
patriots. And vise-versa. When we recognize
this fact, negotiation seems even more justiﬁ»
able.

Those who oppose negotiation are always
quick to argue that negotiation in some way le-
gitimizes terrorism, and thus encourages more
terrorist acts in the future. If done properly,
negotiation can have the opposite effect, Take
the negotiations between the British government
and the IRA as an example. The rules were
simple: ifiiegotiation is to take place, violence
must stop. Thus, even as the groups negotiated
a solution, the British government sent a strong
message: Violence will not be tolerated. Also,
we need to remember the roots of terrorism. as
explained above: all prospective terrorist groups
would prefer a nonviolent solution ifthere was
one. A policy of negotiation provides such a
solution. We need to abandon the stereotype of
the blood-thiisty terrorist Terrorists are driven
to commit acts they would normally be opposed
to because they perceive these acts as being the
only way to call attention to their plighl, Give
them another option, and they will use it.

People arguing for nonrnegotiation often
adapt the moral stance vetoed by coldrwar war»
riots like Ronald Rcagan. “Killing," they say,

“Is Wrong, and we will not tolerate it." Ofcourse,
ifthey really felt that killing was wrong, they’d be
willing to try anything that might prevent these
needless death, right’.7 Including negotiating with
terrorists, right? “Now, hold on asecond," they‘ll
say, “We will prevent terrorists from killing people.
We‘ll do it by killing terrorists every time they
threaten us. That'll send a message: don't mess
with us." This argument disregards a basic fact:
like breeds like. Violence breeds violence, hatred
breeds hatred, and thus by adopting a “zero-toler-
ance" stance, non-negotiation proponents set the
stage for an ever—escalating war of us versus them.
At the same time, peace breeds peace. By paving
the way to an end to violence, negotiation saves
lives that could not be saved any other way.
Finally, the possibility of terrorists using nuclear
weapons needs to be addressed. Since the colr
lapse of the USSR, there have been numerous

“tales of terror” about how different terrorist
groups were trying to purchase a nuclear bomb.

We need to understand that the use of a nuclear

The “shoot the terrorists” policy
won’t work: no alternative to
violence is offered, and the ter-
rorists become more desperate.

weapon goes against the terrorist mentality. Ter-
rorists want witnesses, not dead bodies. And they
want public support, not public condemnation.
Also, we need to realize that terrorists could kill
many more people than they do using the technol-
ogy they have now, if that was their goal. Car
bombs could be built big enough to destroy an
entire city—block, Yet, they aren't. Because ter»
rorists want to send a message, not kill as many
people as possible, Which means that they would
have no use for a weapon of mass destruction like
a nuclear bomb. Only government leaders are in-
sane enough to use those.

Negotiation provides a nonviolent alternative
to terrorism; it sends the signal that violence is
wrong while simultaneously providing an alterna-
tive to violence; and finally, it works to solve the
political problems that cause terrorism in the first
place. The “shoot the terrorists" policy won’t
work: violence breeds violence; the root problem
is not solved; no alternative to violence is offered;
and the terrorists become more desperate. leading
to even more Violent acts. Look at history: we‘ve
been working off of this policy for 40 years. Has
terrorism stopped? Look at Israel. For three de-
cades. their anti»terrorism forces were respected
world-wide. But what ended the Intafada (the
“war" between Israel and the PLO)? Negotiation.
