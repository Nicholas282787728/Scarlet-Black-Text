Following in the tradition ofan
holiest mistake made last year, SGA
neglected to hold student lDiKlnthEs
this fall, Student initiatives allow,
according to the SGA Constitution,
"the student booly io express its tol—
lective opinion on campus. state,
national, or international issues,"
While in many cases symbolic, the
importance of broadcasting strident
opinion on importanr looal and gl0«
hal issues cannot be understated; it is
empowering and gives our campus a
Voice. The root rlmr anystuoenr can
initiate a proposal, filter it through

faculty and administration there can
recognize the learning value of the
expanded experiential, artistic, and
nonrtradtional course work, if the
money people there can continue to
fund the stutlentertin learning system
since its inception over twenty years
ago, why can't the folks at Grinnell?
Tbeopportunrty torstutlenrs to make

can show the administration that we
are serious about gaining some direct
