“From the Right”

To the editor:

Reading David Rudel's attempt
at simplityingeconomics roasimple
function or the presidency (“From
the Right," Scarlet 6t Black, April
19), I was struck by the ludicrous
assumptions he makes in order to
support his lalssez—r’aire conclusion,
His column demonstrates that the
United States continues to have an
imperfect economy under a main«
stream presidenr, but it doesnot show
the “failures” of economic liberal—
ism, nor even the presence of“liber»
alism” during the Clinton adminiSr
ttation

Ignoring the fact that a coun-
[ty’s economy is affected by both
monetary (actions of the central
bank) and fiscal (government spend<
ing) policy,Rude| associates econom—
ic performance solely with the pres—
ident's unrealized political ideals.
The “liberal” spending packages that
Clinton pledgedduringhiscampaign,
such as national health care, have
been forgotten. Fiscal policy has
changed little since the Bush admin-
istration; monetary policy has also
been consistent Alan Greenspan,
the current Fed chairman, was reap—
pointed to another four—year term
last month. First appointed byRonald
Reagan,Greerispancontinuestosup
port a firm policy of “near—zero" in—
flation, a target abhorred by liberals
and critiCized by many corporate
businesspeopleandRepublicans. Bill
Clinton, on the other hand, appears
Sansﬁeds

While the levels of taxation
Rudel protests are indeed determined
by fiscal policy, Clinton is not about
to change the tax structure of the
United States to match that ofGer—
many. Mr. Rutlel claims that Ger—
man cit ens “pay something on the
order of 60 or 70 percent of their
income back to the government as
tax " A quick check of the 1996
Economic Report or the President
shows that Germans pay 46 5 perr
cent of GDP in taxes, while Ameri<
cans pay 31.5 percent.

Beyond the inaccuracies, l rind
it most ditiicult to accept the labeb

his lofty campaign promises, Clinton

has dcmonslrait-d that his economic
policies are yirtually indistinguishs
able from George Bush. Mt. Rudel
tosses generalizations such as “after
the greatest increase ingoyernment
regulation" (presumably under the
Clinton administration), but these
arguments are unsubstantiated Be—
yond the (nor that the North Amer
ican Free Trade Agreement (NAF—

times to support deregulation efforts

elimination of local cable teleVision
monopolies.

The United states economy is
no longer basking in the heady te—
coyery that followed the 1990—91
recession, but it is iar from suiicring.
Before Mr Rudel attempts to show
the tortures ofpolicy, he should rec.
ognize what he is analyzing. Presi.

should not be mistaken as one.

Re: Jenny Wood

Members of the campus community:

it has been eight to nine weeks
since Jenny Wood, Assistant Profes
sot of Physical Education was the
subject ofa disparaging letter in the
S&B and an offensive and widely
sent e-mail message regarding man—
agement of the Women’s Soccer
Team.

In the interest of a measure of
justice for Professor Wood, I would
like to respond to these communica«
tions with some positive but firmly
grounded observations Being well
acquainted with Jenny Wood for
eight years as a student, AlleAmeri—
can athlete,‘and coach, I have never
known her to be other than a person
ofconsummate good Judgement,fair—
ness, and maturity, I could summon
numerous respccred members of the
faculty, the student body, the alum—
ni, and the wider Community who
would second this opinion In the
judgment of her professional colr
leagues, she is a coach and teacher of
considerable promise. l—ler actions
have always reflected very well on
Grinncll College, and in the process
she has been iinsii igly loyal to
this institution 1 am quite tamliiar
with her conduct as coach ofWom—
en‘s Soccer and with the matters
alluded to in the aforementioned
communications, and in all of this 1
see no reason to depart one whit from
inyearlieropinionother,cyceptthat
her forbearance exceeds what I knew.

Setting out to comfort the afﬂicted

BY BRUCE FRIEDRICH

This week, i want to talk about
us policy with regard to MeXico, an
excellentcasestudyin the newworld
otdetfsameoldsl1*t). ’resently, the
USconsidetsMeXico to be oneofout
yery best irienels Let’s take a look at
a recent speech by the us ambassa—
dnr to Mesico, former us Rep. Jim
Jones.

First, he explained that us rela—
rions with MeXico are ”a symbol to
the rest ofthe world of what kind of
partner the us can be." Let's briefly
look at this statement from three
vantage points: tirsr. who is Mexico?
second, What is us policy toward
Mexrcol Finally, what is the effect of
us policy iii Mexico?

First, rhc MeXican goyei-nmenr

corporate interests (The top 25 com—
panies in Mexico control almost half

can federal pOl|Cei The Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PR1), a misnOr
mer if ever there were one, has run
the country by tertot and intimidae
tion since 1929.

There are presently maJor popu—
lat revolutions, a direct result of
NAFTA and Structural Adjustment
undertheWorld Bank, in two South—
ern Mexican states, Chiapas and
Guerrera. The government is at»
tempting to forcibly crush both re»
bellions; they are keeping enemies
lists, murdering labor organisers, and
massacring peasants

It is telling that Mr,Jones speaks
repeatedly of“economic reforms” in»
stitutcd by Mexican leaders who
“toccive[d] a large part of their edu—
carion in the us " Jones claims an

sities like Harvard and Yale breaks
down prenidice, No, what it does is
further removes these leaders from
the populace, the 50% of MeXico's
19 million people who live in poi/en
ty, the 20% who do not consume
enough calories to sustain basic life
functioning.

A comparison of us treatment

ship which preceded Castro.

Howdoes the US deal with right
wing dictatorship: like Me ' col The
same way we always hay . First, US
troops train Mex an troops; second,
the us supplies MeXicp with more
than three-fourths otits weapons ac»
quisitions (more than $100 million
every year); third, the US passes a
new “counrerterrorism” bill to deny

Mexican political reiugees duc pro
cess rights, fourth, we build fences to
keep Mexicans out of the country
(already, zoo—300 Mexicans die ttyr
ing to cross into the US every year,
mostly by drowning in the Rio
Grandel); fifth, we send our indus«
tries there to furtherpollute the land,
water, and air, crush the small farm—
ers, and exploit Mexican workers.

It is telling that, until economic
“reform"began in the 19805, Mexico
was basicallyselfrsufficient and host«
cd few high.polliition companies.
Agriculture remained a sustainable
vocation Already, thousandsofsmall
farmers have been forced into al«
ready crowded cities as a result of
NAFTA, Millions will follow, ac—
cording to the MeXican Secretary of
Agriculture (iiiliosupporrsNAFTA).

since 1965 and the partial free
trade agreement with Mexico, oyei
2000 us tactoiies have relocated to
Mexico (all are srili there). They
employ oyer 500,000 lowskill work»
crs at an aiierage wage oiless than 50
cents per hour (and railing). Two.

are less likely to try to organize in.
deed, these workers have no unions
and no benefits. Additionally. Mex—
ico has no free press, no heedom to
organize, and no legal Citizen advo—
cacy groups.

Jones speaks of “sweeping eco—
nomic reform now gripping Mexico,
and the huge potential market in
that country Just opening to unfet-
tered US trade." Gripping reform
indeed. This may be good for the few
people who own M€X|CO and the
CEO: who run US businesses which
are interested in relocating their la—
bot<intensive factories, but it is a
nightmaretorMexicanandustarm
ers and workers Jones acknowledges
that NAFTA precipitated the peso
crisis last September, but fails to ac-
knowledge the misery the bailout is
creating in the liycs of poor Mex.—
cans (the maJotity ofthe population
but not, of course, anyone in the
government). As usual, the rich in—
yestors w ~re bailed out by the gov-
etninent.

one interesting bit of honesty
in lones's speech reads “Among op—
porrunities fotUSexports to Mexico
are intermediate goods for MeXican
companies gearing up tor export,"
Translated into English: US compa-
nies export raw materials to their
subsidiaries who turn them mto final
products and ship them back to the
United States, where people can afr
ford to buy them Over fifty percent
of “trade” With Mexico works this
way This allows us companies to
move to MeXico. where wages are
much lower, laborprotection (\vlieth«
ei' health or freedom to organise) is
noneexistent, and environmental
standards go totally unentorced

Irithe US<owned factorieswhich
exist in Mexrco, between 1969 antl
1989, 95 percent of industrial waste

sludge directly into the rivers that

beyond recognition or use (as water,
anyway),

Jones suggests that "There has
been a great growth of commercial
relations between the US and
Mexico...The real diplomats are the
business executives who create
wealth." He might have added “for
the few already rich and educated,
while the rest ofthe countrystarves."
Why do you think people are trying
to escape into thiscountry. We don't
see any US citizens trying to escape
Southl

So, Mexico is “a symbol to the
rest of the world of what kind of
partner the US can be".7 Indeed, as
big business becomes larger and less
interested in a social contract with
workers, they will rnoye to make larg—
er and larger profits, no matter what
the cost to human beings or the en—
vrronment. For the fourth straight
year, corporations have posted dou.
ble<digit growth in profits; for the
14th straight year, the average wage
has fallen in this country. It is all
linked by the growing tendency of
corporations to dominate both polit—
ical and economic reform through.
out the world.

I am amazed bylones' honesty in
conclusion: “We encourage you to
consider the US Embassy as a re—
source to explore these markets."
Jones said the Embassy in Mexico
can provide market surveys, infor—
mation about potential suppliers and
contractual information about Mex—
ican companies. In other words, the
USEmbassyin Mexrco is nowapimp
for businesses who wish to exploit
cheap and desperate workers, lax en—
vironmentalstandards, and coloniab
iaed production systems.

us citizens should look good
and hard at our complicity and si.
lence in the face of this travesty
againstMecho,Mexicans,USwork»
ers, and the global environment.
