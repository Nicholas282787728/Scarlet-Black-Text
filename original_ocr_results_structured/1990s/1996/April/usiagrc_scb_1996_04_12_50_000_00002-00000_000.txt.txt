GovernorTel-ry Branstad recent—
ly awarded certificates ofrecognition
to Liz Hastings ‘95 and Lori Smoker
for theirworkwith theGrmnellSAFE
Coalition promoting a Substance-
Abuse Free Environment.

The ceremony, held on March
11th, celebrated the te<cettification
of the Grinnell Coalition’s state grant
and recognized other veteran mem-
bers. Governor Branstad created the
SAFE program about five years ago,
and it focuses on individuals within
the community to direct the educa—
tion efforts on substance abuse. The
Grinnell group includes parents, po<
lice officers, school officials and rep.
tesentatives of businesses and tells
gious groups.

Both Hastings and Smokerhave
been involved with SAFE since they
arrived in Otinnell because it was an
opportunity to continue doing com—
munity work. Hastings was very ac—
tive in her high school because, in
addition to school, issues of “safe-
living" occupy a major role in her
life. “There’sadifferentkindofwotk
that needs to be done, besides aca«
demia,” she says.

Theirinvolvementhasalsopro.
videdan important link between the
College and the community in its
service efforts, Smoker. a residence»
life coordinator, enjoys interacting
with town leaders and parents be—
cause they share their experiences
and offer a different perspective on
Grinnell. “It’s nice having that Con-
nection with people." she says,

Programs they have worked with
were the Red Ribbon campaign in
October and Healthy Choices Week
at Grinnell Community High School.
For Red Ribbon Week, they saved
money by designing and construct—
ing the ribbons themselves The
ribbons were later distributed in
schools and to local businesses to
promote substance<free living.

They also helped organize
Healthy Choices Week which edu—
cared students on healthy decision—
making on issues such as teen preg»
nancy and substance use. Hastings

Hastings, who also works in the
Community Service Center with the

dies/Sistersprogtam,hasbeenpleased
with the opportunities in Gtinnell.
“i was really thrilled to find a group
who was willing to work with peo.
ple,” she says about SAFE. One of
the most important things she does
foryouths is offethercommitment to
healthy choices in her his and be a
positive role model.

Smoker was also active in pro—
grams for healthy decision»making
since her firstayearatSt Mary‘sCol-
lege of Maryland. It is important, she
explains, to develop annual tradi-
tionsaroundtheseprogramsandczimt
paigns because it shows a commit—
ment to learning and open discus»
sion within the community. During
the winter holiday season, she con.
tributed to the “Celebrate with Cate"
campaign which makes suggestions
for responsible patties. She offered
this campaign to the College faculty
and student body. and tries to in»
clude thecollege in manycampaigns.

Hastings has enioyed her expe»
rience in Grinnell because she finds
the programs consistent with othcrs
in her hometown, but has also learned
to adjust to a new environment.
