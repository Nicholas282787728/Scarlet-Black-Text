New SGA cabinet causes controversy

ANDY WEIDNER
STAFF WRITER

Next year’s SGA government
got off to a rocky start Wednesday
night as [he SGAJoint Board mct to
confirm the Cabinet picks of future
SGA President Rupin Thakkar ‘97
and Vice—president Trevor Forath
‘97 Although all of the candidates
were confirmed, one of them met
with considerable opposition from
the current SGA Cabinet and a sec—
and was heavily questioned by Cab—
me! and senators alike.

The candidates in question were
Dari Rogge ‘97 for Concerts Chair
and Matt Saiia ‘97 for Films Chair
who were both confirmed by a mat»
gin of 13—3 with three abstentions in
both cases. A 2/3 majority of the
Joint Board is needed for successful
confirmation of a candidate. All
other candidates were confirmed by
unanimous votes, With one absten—
tion in two cases.

Before a vote was taken, each
candidate was asked to share With
the Joint Board any past experience
he orshe has had in the position they
applied for and any new ideas they
might have for the position. Rogge,
who is currently spending a semester
in Chicago booking bands and doing
publicity for the Metro, the largest
fullrtlme concert club in the area,
explained that he has made many
connections in the music industry

Rage Against the Machine. by doth

He also expressed interest in increas<
ing the quality of lighting at Harris,
as well as making Harris a coder
place for smaller bands to play.

The floor was then opened for
questions and a few members of the
current SGA Cabinet began to in.

to work with the Harris start. Rogge
answered that he believes he can

level with the utmost respect, Dixon

current Treasurer Megan
Hailey—Dumheath ‘97 then took the
floorpraisingcurrentConcertsChait
Charlie Clark ‘97 for the job he has
done balancing the concerts budget
this semester. as well as communi»
eating with the other Cabinet mem«
bers. Clark, who stepped in this
semester to fill the Concerts Com»
mittee Chair after the first semester
Chairperson resigned, had applied to
fill the position again next year but
was turned down by Thakkar and
Potath. During the meeting, Clark
explained how he felt that Thakkar
and Pomth had chosen their Candl/
date unfairly because they had often
said publicly that they were looking
for people With new ideas for the
respective cabinet positions, and
how hc felt that inost ofRogge's ideas
were not new.

A number otsennrors began to
question the tale that the current
Cabinet members were playing in
the selection process, One senator
expressed that it was clear to him
that the Cabinet had previously talc.
en a position on Rogge’s candidacy,
antl wished to know why the Cabinet
had chosen against him. The Cabi«
net members who protested simply
replied that Clark is currently doing
agood job as Concerts Chairand also
deserved consideration,

In a writicn statement to the
S&B, Thakkar writes: “Although I
do believe that the President, [hc
Vice—President and most of the Cab-
inet officersdidhave the same goal as
theSenarorslnasklngquesuons,cet—

rain officers came with a mission to
grill the Concerts and Films noml/
nees. This was apparent not only in
the number of questions and com—
ments and the manner in which they
were presented, but by the nature of
the questions as well. These Cabinet
officers asked questions that could
only be answered by someone who
has served in the position already.”

After Rogge's narrow Confirmzr
tron, MattSalio ‘97 was givenaclose
questioning by senators and Cabinet
membersalikeastohisqualifications
and goals for the position or Films
Chair. This was partly due to a
concern expressed by current vice—
President Alex Ravitz ‘96 that the
Joint Board, especially in past years,
has been prone to giving “nibber
stamp" approval to programs with—
out really knowing the details. A
number of senators later raised the
point that they were given no infer»
mat ion as to the duties of each of the
cabinet positions or background in.

for approval, and were thus unable to
make a well informed deCision.

Cial Coordinator. John Hjelm ‘98
was confirmed as Assistant Treasurer
and automatically takes the office of
Treasurer for the ‘97 J98 school year.
Josh Bomhorst ‘98 will be next year’s

Treasurer.

In written statements to the
5&3. both Thakkar arid Porath ex—
pressed concern that there may be
some ”unavoidable uncomfortablv
ty” in the transition and training
process that the new Cabinet mem.
bers must go through with the cur«
rent SGA Cabinet. But they hope
that with time any problems will be
ironed out, and they look forward to

working With the Cabinet that they
have chosen.

lnanintewiewpriottotheJoint
Board meeting, Thakkar and Porath
outlined a number or their goals for
the upcoming school year which in«
clude a proposal for the formation of
a new Cabinet position to help {301'
mm communication between the
various student organizations and
SGA and within SGA itself. The
new Cabinet position, called theStu—
dent Group Liaison/Publicity COOP
dinator, would chair a newly formed
committee called Common Ground.
”(his new committeewould bringsrw
dent groups together to help them
coordinate programs more efﬁcient—
ly so that efforts by one group willnot
be duplicated by another. This proe
posalwas discussed by theJoint Boatdi
and will be voted on at their next
meeting. Thakkar arid Poroth also
hope to make SGA more accessible
[0 Student Staff and first—year stu—
dents. as well as to implement amerit
system for providing funds to campus
groups instead of the “first come, first
serve” basis by which funds are cur—
rently distributed.
