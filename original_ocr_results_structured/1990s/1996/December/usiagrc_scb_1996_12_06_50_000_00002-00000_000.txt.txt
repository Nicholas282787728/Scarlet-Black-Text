Convocation wraps up SQC celebrationoontmued from p.1

of last year was a Symposium held
in November, 1995. The title of the
conference was “To Build a Better
World — Changing Visions of Pub-
lic Service." The Symposium contin-
ued Grinnell College’s tradition as it
encouraged and promoted dedication
to the seerce of others.

Possibly the largest event of the
celebration was the College‘s interim
session. This mini»ten'n took place in

.January of 1996 before the school
year's second semester began. The
interim session involved approxi-
mately 590 students and featured 28
different mini-courses. One of the
greatest accomplishments of the in-
terim session was the strengthened
and increased interaction between
current students and Grinnell alumni.
The interim session was organized
so that both the alumni teachers and
the participating students would
learn from each other as they at-
tempted to explore the ideas that will
have definite impacts on both
Grinnell College and the twenty-ﬁrst
century.

Last spring’s largest Sesquicen»
tennial event was a birthday party
which was held for Grinnell College.
The event took place on Mac Field
under large, big»top tents. The party
included a dinner, live big band mu—
sic, and the annual Spring Waltz
party. The event drew a crowd of ap-
proximately 1350 people, 1000 of
whom were students.

.The Sesquicentennial celebration
continued this semester with major
events such as a special concert per-
formance by Grinnell alumnus
Herbie Hancock, the “China in the
215! Century" Symposium, the
“Odessa — the Vanished World Re-
visited" Symposium, and the SQC
Writers Series. The Herbie Hancock
concert drew another large crowd of
Grinnellians as Darby Gym was
packed with students, faculty, admin-
istration members, and alumni. The
SQC Writer’s Series was organized
b' alumnus Ed Hirsch, who has been
teaching a two-credit writing‘ semi»
riér throughout the semester in con»
junction with the Writer‘s Series.

Ii In addition to the many Sesqui-
o‘éntennial events. the College has
also sponsored many projects by both
pkofessors and students. Many of the

projects have focused on the history
ofCtrinnell College. Mr. Moyer said,
“The Sesquiccntennial has helped
Grinnell develop an understanding of
its past and present. We have estab-
lished a better sense of our own his
tory." Some of the SQC projects in

“Grinnell Scenes" by Professor Rob-
ert McKibbin: “What We Remem»
ber: An Oral History of Grinnell
College 1925-1992" by Kara Bakken
‘92: “Broken Ground," a major mue
sical composition by Jonathan
Chenette, associate professor ofmu»
sic; “From Herron to Hopkins,” a
course taught by Economics Profes-
sor Brad Bateman; “A Multicultural
Review of Grinnell College“ by
Shereen Ali ‘97; and the forthcom-
ing College history by the late Pro»
fessor Joseph Wall.

The ﬁnal ofﬁcial event of the Ses»
quicentennial occurred at yesterday ’5
Convocation when the first winners
of the Joseph F. Wall Sesquicenten-
nial Service Awards were announced.
Mr. Wall graduated from Grinnell
College in 1940 and returned as a
professor ofhistory in 1947. Mr. Wall
later served as an administrator for
the College. He passed away in the
fall of 1995. Mr. Meyer said, “Mr.

 

volunteeredto enforce it amongst
themselves, it was deemed unreason»
able because noise from the game
rdom would interfere in North
Lounge events
._ Those in favor of banning smok»
ing in the Nonh Lounge asserted the
fact that although smokers would not
be able to smoke in the Forum, they
would still be allowed to enter the
building.
Those who are highly allergic to
cigarette smoke, on the other hand,
are currently forced to avoid the

building for health reasons. Further,
there are hall lounges where smok-
ing is still permitted and where stu-
dents can retreat without impinging
on the rights of others.

This comment was countered by
SGA senator Elise Pfannenstiel ‘98,
who said, “If you’re an off campus
student, the Forum is the only place
on campus you can go to smoke.“

Finally a motion was made and
passed to ask CSL for another sug»
gestion, with the possibility of ban»
ning smoking in the North Lounge

Wall was a legendary tciicher and a
distinguished scholar. We all looked
up to him as the epitome of
Grinnell.” In memory of Mr. Wall,
the service award was established
this year as a legacy of the Scsquie
centennial.

The recipients of this year’s Io-
seph F, Wall Sesqulcentcnnial Ser»
vice Awards receive up to $25,000
to fund a year-long service project
This year there were 49 applicants
who competed for four awards. The
applicants represented the classes of
1936 to 1997.A1Thursday's Convo-
cation, President Ferguson an-
nounced this year's four winners. and
a video of the winner’s explaining
their projects was shown.

Doug Cutchins and Anne
Geisslnger, both of ‘93, work for the
Peace Corps in Suriname, with the
award that they received, they plan
to repair and electrify a village school
and building as well as supply a vil-
lage llbrary forthe 1,500 Sannaccan
residents near the Gran Lio River.
Jenny Eagan ‘49 intends to inaugu»
rate 3 concerts series in Santa Fe,
New Mexico, featuring multi»ethnic
music from the period of the Span—
ish Conquest of the Southwest. Her
goal is to use music to increase m.
ter»cultural understanding.

Lynn Leeper will create the K21-
leidoscope Conference in Washing-
ton State for families with children
with disabilities. The aim ofthe pro-
gram is to increase the communica-
tion between parents and serv1ce pro-
viders through workshops. Ric
MacDowell plans to organize a pro-
gram which focuses on developing
the education and skills ofdisenfran»
chised children and parents in rural
West Virginia. The goal of the pro-
gram is to provide both the parents
and children with support and train—
ing from adult mentors.

After this year’s recipients were
announced, the 18-month Sesquicen»
tennial celebration came to a close
in the same manner in which it
started. Grant 0. Gale, professor
emeritus of physics, rang the
College's bell in Herrick Chapel to
conclude the celebration. President
Pam Ferguson said, “The ringing of
the bell marks the beginning of our
next 150 years."

Smoking continued from page I

in the future.

When Thakkar said, “As it is right
now there‘s still smoking in the for
rum,” the attending smokers re»
sponded with applause and cheers.

Although the SGA lneeting was
not yet over, a mass exodus to the
door ensued, as those who had come
solely to defend their right to smoke
left the room.

Moments later, outside ofARH, a
non-smoking building,alarge crowd
of students stood bent against the
wind as they lit their cigarettes.

Waltz continued from p.1

to student demand." said Mattson.

This waltz will not feature an or-
chestra. which is traditionally
brought in only {or the spring event.

The tradition and history involved
in waltz are two of the primary as-
pects lhiil draw students to waltz,
according to Manson “Waltz is one
of the things important to
Grinnellians that we're really proud
of," she said.

Its popularity has propelled it to
become the most well-attended
Grinncll social event of the year,
leaving oven the well-loved Disco
behind in the running.

Maltsoll also feels that waltz is an
important occasion because “it draws
a kind of cross segment of people
from all over campus."

Waltz attracts a wide variety of
students, including many who don‘t
often attend allvcampus activities or
Harris events. “I would like this
waltz to be one that people remem»
her," Maltson szild. ‘
