Gridders continue to roll with
first Midwest Conference win

Humiston named MWC defensive player of the week

BY ERIC RIENSCHE

Sports Information

Last Saturday, Grinnell defeated
the MWC North Division power»
house Beloit by the convincing
score of45-20. In doing so the Pier
neers registered their first victory
against Beloitsince 1977 and simuln
taneously lifted their own confis
dence level to a higher plane.

Although the 45-point perforv
mance suggests a good day for the
offense, the real story behind the
victory was Grinnell's effort on spe-
cial teams and on defense. The Pio-
neers recorded eight sacks and
forced seven turnovers while cone
ceding 298 yards of total offense.
Leading the charge was game MVP
Kevin Humiston who racked up 11
tackles, including 2.5 sacks. For his
effort Humiston was named MWC
defensive player ofthe week. Junv
ior captain Robby Lane had a game

high 13 tackles and an interception.
Juniors Darwin Cluppcr and Evan
Petig also ﬁgured prominently into
the mix with two fumble recoveries
and two interceptions respectively.

While the defense performed bril-
liantly. the most exciting plays came
from the special teams. Early in the
first quarter sophomore Stan Banks
connected with Wade Krause for a
50-yard scoring strike on a fake
punt. Later in the quarter Krause
recovered a fumble on a punt, set-
ting up another early score. The
Pioneers’ strong special teams play
energized the team and propelled
them to a 21-0 lead. Beloit ans
swered with two touchdowns to
close the deficit to 21-14. But with
only 53 seconds remaining in the
half. quarterback Sean Cotten
mounted a final drive, As time ex-
pired Cotten threw a touchdown
pass to ﬂanker Richard Werner to
give Grinnell the 28-14 halftime ad—

vantage. “That score at the end of
the first half gave us a lot of mo-
mentum," remarked Coach Greg
Wallace.

The second half was a mere for-
mality as the Pioneers churned out
yardage on the ground, led by Jim
Hart's 125 rushing yards. Cotten
ran for one of his three rushing
touchdowns of the day and Krause
added another. Nathan Solmose
also chipped in afield goal.

In this weekend’s matchup against
Ripon, Grinnell will need a defenr
sive effort like that against Beloit.
”We are going to face an explosive
team,” said Coach Greg Wallace.
“Ripon has outstanding athletes.
They throw the ball well on offense
and pursue relentlessly on defense.“
The Pioneers (2-1) will battle na»
tionaliy-rat‘ed Ripon in 2 Midwest
Conference matchup on
Rosenbloom Field at 1:30 pm to-
morrow.

team," concluded Coach Freeman.
