Ninth Semester in Art
Fellowship recipients to
be honored in reception

A reception will be held for the two 1996 recipients
ofthe Ninth Semester in Art Fellowships, Andrea Mar-
tin and John Wenderoth, at 4: 15 pm. Friday. December
13. in Burling Gallery of Burling Library at Grinnell
College. Their works will be exhibited from December
l0, 1996, through January 10. 1997.

“The ninthrsemester fellowship allows a student to
create a body of work. expand his or her portfolio and
gain maturity in his or her field of expertise," Martin

said, Martin has created functional pottery, including

sets of dishes, bowls, pitchers and vases.

“All of my work is thrown pottery using
cinnimonstone and Minnesota stoneware.
Cinnimonstone contains more grit and is slightly more
oven proof at higher temperatures. All of the works are
microwave and dishwasher safe." Martin said.

“I‘ve been concentrating on improving my throwing
skills, elegance of the forms, trying some new forms.
and being. more playful and adventurous in my decorar
tive techniques," Martin said.

Her work, which combines the use ofdippcd, sprayed
and poured glaze techniques, will be for sale.

John Wendetoth's works include paintings, Construcr
tions and collages.

“This semester, l've been experimenting with come
bining various techniques and materials," Wenderoth
said.

”With painting, more specifically I’ve been aiming
toward simultaneously constructed and destroyed ime
ages. The latter work, using acrylic/latex paint on com-
position board, allows me to tear into a surface with tools
while continuously building that surface up with paint.
An interaction with ‘the canvas’ becomes an undoing of
itselfif successful. The undoing. though is the creative
act," Wenderoth said

“In my acrylic paintings; I’ve created flaws in the
surfaces. I’ve tried to be more physical with the paint,
more violent The colors I‘ve used have stemmed out
of physical work I was doing," Wenderoth said.

Grinnell College ~ Grinnell, Iowa

Convocation
concludes SQC

Wall Service Awards announced

BY DAVID BURNETT
Staff Wri tcr

Yesterday’s Scholar’s Convocation of-
ﬁcially concluded Grinnell College’s 18-
month Sesquicentennial (SQC) celebra-
tion. Although there will still be a few
more SQC events next semester. this
week’s Joseph F, Wall Sesquicentennlal
Service Award Convocation was the last
official event of the celebration.

The Sesquicentennial celebration bee
gan two semesters ago and has since fea—
tured over 75 events on campus. In addi-
tion, Gtinnell's Sesquicentennial has been
celebrated off»campus with more than 60
events throughout the country. These off-
campus events were organized by regional
coordinators in eight major cities, and the
goal of the off-campus events was to
spread the Sesquicentennial celebration to
the alumni and friends of Grinnell Col-
lege,

In an interview on Tuesday. Sesquicenr
tennial Committee Conchair Wayne
Meyer said, “I have mixed feelings about
the conclusion oftlte Sesquicentennial. It
has been both exhilarating and exhaustr
ing, There has been a great sense of ac
complishment during the celebration, but
now that it is ending, thcre is also a great
sense of relief."

The ﬁrst mayor eventofthe Sesqulcellr
tennial celebration occurred on Sepleinr
her 22, 1995 with the College’s rededt-
cation of Goodnow Hall, The rededicat-
ion of the College‘s oldest remaining
building featured the tirst ringing of the
College‘s bell in more than [00 years. The
ceremony also included a procession of
the administration and faculty in formal
academic regalia and an allrcampus pic-
nic.

December grads reach
decade peak this year

BY KATE KLEINWDRTH
Staff Writer

This month, 35 Grinnell students will
receive their diplomas and graduate 21 se»
mester before the rest ofthc student body.
Some of these Decembcr graduates arr.
what are known as “early grads"¥stur
dents graduating from Grinnell College
with fewer than eight full semesters in
residence,

The percentage of students who gradu-
ate early remained in the smglc digits until
four years ago. Between 1992 and 1996
the percentage of early grads increased
from 5% to 11%, the highest it has been
in the last decade.

There are several reasons for students
to graduate early, College Registrar Roger
Lasley believes one ofthe reasons for this
increase in the number ofearly grads may
be ﬁnancial. For instance, students with
ﬁnancial problems may choose to gradur
ate a Semester early, to decrease the cost
of their diplomas.

“I think the hidden agenda is ﬁnances,"
Mr. Lasley said. “I don’t know why this
might enter into it, but that might be a p057
sible reason for the bump.” ’

Transfer students sometimes graduate
early when not all of their credits from
their previous school transfer to Grinnell.

A transfer student may have completed
four semesters elsewhere, but because
their credits did not transfer, they enter
Grinnell as second semester sophomores.
In order to graduate in May with the rest
of their class, they can apply to graduate
early,

These students will have had eight se-
mesters of college, but only have credit
for seven, and are therefore classiﬁed as
early graduates.

Students who take personal or medi-
cal leave frequently graduate at mid-year
sometimes after having received their di-
plomas with the rest of their class.

Most of those who graduate in Decem-
her are not early grads, but students who
took a semester off and are now complet-
ing their eighth semestcrt ‘

Mr. Lasley does not see the increase in
the number of early grads in a negative
light, since it is so slight.

“This is not a bad thing at all," Mr.
Lasley said. “lfit did change significantly,
it would cause projection difficulties in
deciding how many students to admit next
year. But the numbers haven't been all
over the map. What would be worse is if
we had an increase in the number of stu-
dents staying on for a ninth or tenth sc-
mester. The neat thing about Grinnell is

Waltz gets

makeover

New TTluSlC to include swing, big band

BY MELINDA JONES
Staff Writer

The time has come once more for
Grinnelliatis to don their favorite worn
prom duds and get ready to experience
what has become a 21-year tradition at
Grinnell: the social blur affectionately
referred to as waltz.

Winter Waltz will be held on Satur-
day, Deceinber 7 from 9.00 pm. to mid-
night in Harris Center, This season‘s
theme is a 1940’s train station.

The tradition of waltz comes with a
considerable amount of history. The first
waltz ever to be held at Grinnell was or»
ganized in the spring of 1975 by students
living in Russian House and French
House. Quad dining hall was converted
into a ballroom, and the result was so we
cessful that SGA decided to sponsor a
waltz once each semester from that point
on. ,

In past years, waltz has been held any
where from Darby to Harris, or even, in
the case of the spring of 1996, under an
elaborate canopy on Mac Field.

For this year's fall waltz, the festivir
tics return to the Harris Center. which will

be decorated to go along With the ‘40‘s
train station theme. SGA Social Coordi»
nator Karmi Mattson ‘97 said, ”Rather
than trying to fight the decor of Harris,
wedecided that maybe we can,utilizc
what it really does look like."

Extensive planning has gone into
themeerelated decorations for this waltz.
Students attending waltz will be greeting
by a ticket booth upon entering.

Risers will be made into train plat-
forms, and the concessions booth will be
transformed into an old-fashioned news-
stand. Particular highlights inelude a sky-
light and large clock suspended from the
ceiling, as well as a Fred Astaire/Ginger
Rogers movie shown on the back wall of
the stage,

One element of this waltz that distin—
guishes it from other Grinnell waltzes in
the past is the change in music.

This year, instead of being presented
with only waltz music. students will be
ableto dance to big band and swing tunes
as well.

“The switch from strictly waltz music
to a mixture of waltz and big band is due

Smoker’s haven threatened by SGA

A health direat to some, a way oflyfe to others, smoking may soon be banned in die Forum

BY COURTNEY SHERWOOD
News Editor

On Wednesday, at an SGA Joint Board
meeting in ARH 102, the possiblity of
banning smoking in the Forum was raised.
Smokers living both on and off campus
arrived en massc to protect one of their
few remaining havens on campus

Since 1992i when smoking was pel'r
niilted throughout the Forum, increasing
restrictions have gradually eliminated ac-
ceptable smoking venues iintil only the
North Lounge remained

SGA Secretary James Rechs ‘97 Sum
marized the situation when he said. “Right
now the North Lounge is a smoking
lounge The Committee on Student Life
discussed this and they moved to not have
any smoking in the Forum "

The recommendation to ban smoking
in the Forum by the Committee on Slur
dent Life (CSL) was based in pan on Come
plaints that poor ventilation caused smoke
to enter administrator's offices, SGA
President Rupin Thakkar ‘97 said that
there are forum workers who are allergic
to smoke In addition, smoke lingers in
the North Lounge evelt when nobody is
smoking. and “because movies show in
the North Lounge on Fridays . . , Students
allergic to smoke don’t go to the mones,"

said Thakkar,

 

Initially. it appeared that
SGA senators were evenly (lie
vidcd for and ngmnsi banning
smoking, When a move to
postpone the issue was with-
drawn, however. an hour long
debate ensued.

Smoking advocates sligr
gested that if ventilation was a
problem, either new Ventilar
tioii could be added, or the lo
cation oi the smoking room
could be changed. "I don’t
think it's it good idea to ban it
until an alternative is found,"
said SGA senator Rehecca
Stnitli. ”If we gel pushed out
Without an alternative, things
Iltc going to get ugly."

The possibility of new non.
tilation was turned down be

students argued that smoking presents a health risk that infringes on their rights.

usually kept shut. however, by students
in the sun room and the game room who
do not want to inhale cigarette smoke.
Also, othei looms did not prove to be a

employees.

Some students denied the existence of
a problem at all Said Tobit Links ‘98, “I
was a noiirsmoker for two weeks, and I

didn‘t smell anything, although my senses

were particularly sensitive at that time,"
Others suggested temporary alterna-
tlves, such as banning smoking foran hour

doors during activities. Although many
smokers supported this suggestion and
