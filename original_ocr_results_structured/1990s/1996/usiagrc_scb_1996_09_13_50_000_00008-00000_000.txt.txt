In what turned out to be merely a
warm-up for this week’s tough
matches, the Grinnell College men’s
soccer team defeated Illinois College
on Saturday, 3-0, The Pioneers (1»
O) dominated the match, registering
26 shots on goal to the Blue Boys' 1.
“We had some trouble scoring,"
commented Coach John Pﬁtsch, “but
this ﬁrst win 15 really going to help
our conﬁdence. Our passing game
was very good as was our defense."

The Pioneers had to maintain their
composure in the face of some rough
play by the Blue Boys. who commite
ted numerous foul: and had one player
ejected But Grinncll responded with
iis trademarks: aggressive offense and
swarming zone defense.

offensively, junior Andy Lee gave
the Pioneers a huge lift by scoring
the ﬁrst goal seven minutes into the
first half. A short time later senior
captain Ryan McGary added another
goal to give Grinnell a 2-0 edge at
halftime, Midway through the sec-
ond period sophomore William Lee-
Ashlcy iced the game with the third
and final goal. “I was pleased with
the way we responded to their man-
to~man defense," said Coach Pfitsch.
“We do not practice against it often,
so it could have been a big problem."

While Coach Pfitsch was pleased
with the improved play ofliis squad,
neither he nor his team will have time
to pat one another on the back. Grin-
ncll faces a tough trip sequence
against some of the region‘s clitc
teams,

The Pioneers face Macalastcr and
St, Olaf, two ofthe top teams from
a Minnesota conference that has
traditionally been very strong.

“I use Macalaster and St, Olaf as
a measuring stick." offcrcd Pfltsch.
“If we play well against them. i
know that we can be successful
against most other teams."

The Pioneers also face confer-
ence rival Coe on the road. Last
season Coe was the MWC team
that was Grinnell’s stiffest compe-
tition in the South Division. “We
cannot rest on what we have ac-
complished in the past," asserted
Coach Pfitsch. “This team needs
to build its own character and ac»
complish its own feats." This
week's trips promise to be a deﬁne
ing test of this team's mettle.

Coach sees “great potential” in ‘96 team

Last Saturday the Pioneers fell to
Iowa Wesleyan in five close games
at the William Penn tournament.
Wesleyan prevailed 12715, 15711.
1015, 15-13 and 15-12. “I atLributc
most of that loss to my experimentr
ing with our lineup. Ithink this week
we'll be more stable and ready for
them," offered Janelle Tieken.

The Pioneers fell in three games to
both Bethel and William Penn. In
the fourth match Grinnell rebounded
with a steady effort against league
foe Cornell. The Pioneers were vic-
torious 15-11, 15-8, 12-15 and 15—6.

“It was good to complete the tourna-
ment with a win," noted Tieken.
“Against Cornell wc relaxed and
played a solid match. The players
were having fun."

Ticken evaluated her squad's first
outing: ”Some of our troubles came
from not getting into a groove be-
cause of multiple subsitutions. We
played a lot of people. I saw great
hustle by our back row and good ate
tack potential by our hitters. Now
we have to ﬁrm up the defense."

Senior captain Liz Nowacki went
down with a leg injury and is double
ful for this weekend. Sophomore

Courtney Sapp showed her allecon-
ference skills with a solid allearound
pcrformance. Tleken was pleased
with rookies Vicki Blank as a middle
hitter, Emily Chan as a setter, and
Jamie Snider as an outside hitter.
Their classmate, Melissa
Kempenaar, saw limited time, but
may have put herself into Coach
Tieken’s future plans. “Melissa was
very effective when she was on the
court," said Tieken.

“Overall last weekend 1 saw some
great potential. We need to get back
to work and iron out some of the
problems," said the coach.

When the Grinnell College football
squad arrived in California for the
opening game against Pomonae
Piizcr, enthusiasm and expectations
were high.

Butjust as the Pioneers found it dif
ﬁcult to adjust to the hot California
climate, they were also hard-pressed
to adjust to Pomona-Pﬁzer's aggrese
sive style. At the final gun the Pier
neers had fallen to the Pomona—Pitzcr
Sagehens, 63-24. “To say I was dis-
appointed would be an understate-
ment," lamented Coach Greg
Wallace. “We had some severe prob-
lems in almost every phase of the
game.“

Although the final tally against
Pomona indicates a blowout, it was
much closer through much of the
contest. Following an impressive dc»
fensivc stop the Pioneers marched 36
yards in six plays to take an early 7-
0 lead, But the Sagchcns came roar-
ing back with three unanswered
touchdowns and a field goal to
snatch a 2477 advantage. Grinnell

hopefully more experience will help
make the team better."

Last Saturday the Pioneers downed
Cornell, 772, in a near reversal of the
1995 outCDme. The meet, which
lasted over 5 and 1/2 hours, was ex-
tremely long with six three-set
matches.

Rookies Amy Kaufman and Aime
Hopper won in straight sets at No. 1
and No.2 singles, Their classmate,
Beth Dadko, fell in three sets at No.
3 singles. At No. 4 team captain Kim
Knous won a threevset decision af-
ter losing the first set 6-0 while
Cindy Robbins also prevailed in a
threersetter. In what Arseneualt
called the match of the day Heather
Korte battled back from a 2-S/match~
point deficit in the second set to win

staged a rally late in the half, scor-
ing nine more points on a 61-yard
bomb to standout ﬂanker Richard
Werner and a 35—yard field goal by
freshman Nathan Solmose. Pomona
added a ﬁeld goal ofits own to hold
the halftime advantage, 27716.

The Pioneers remained in the hunt
for most of the second half. Senior
quarterback Sean Cotten kept his
team-alive by sneaking into the end-

in a third-set tiebreaker. “That was
a great match, I've never seen any-
one come from so far behind," said
Coach Arseneault.

Last week the netwomen also took
on Central in a non-conference con-
test, falling 6—3. In doubles Hopper
and Robbins grabbed a win at No.
3. 8-}. in a preset. Dadko and
Robbins both pulled off singles Vic-
tories at No. 4 and No.5,

“Our Cornell victory was a nice
character builder. It is great to win
some three-set matches and come
from behind to Win. We are so much
improved this season. I’m sure we’ll
see how much a move we can make
in the conference after our three
matches this weekend," cemented
Coach Arseneault,

quarter, however, Pomona notched ,
two scores to put the Grinnollians
well behind. In the fourth quarter the
Pioneers were forced to take risks
and the ﬂoodgates opened. The
Sagehcns scored several consecutive
touchdowns to rack up the lopsided
ﬁnal score.
