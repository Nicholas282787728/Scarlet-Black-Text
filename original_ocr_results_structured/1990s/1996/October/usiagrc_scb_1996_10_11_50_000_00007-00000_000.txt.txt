The New Welfare

By BEN PATRICK
Columnist

Democrats are often painted as “cham-
pions" of the “Welfare state.” This is odd,
since I have yet to meet a Democrat who
thinks welfare (before or after the recent
welfare reforms) is working very well. I‘ll
be the ﬁrst to admit that welfare has prob
lems. However, I don‘t think the Republic
can solutions (slashing the welfare budget
and placing strict limitations on who can
enroll and for how long) will solve any
thing; quite the opposite, I think that no
matter how bad ajob welfare is doing, it‘s
better than what the Republicans want to
replace it with.

At the heart of the problem is a funda-
menml contradiction in the GOP’s thoughts
on welfare. Republicans think (and I agree)
that people need to get off welfare as soon
as possible. However, in order to get off of
welfare, people need to ﬁnd anotherjob, a
job that they can live on. People need help
ﬁnding jobs, and they need to be able to
survive on the wages they receive if we
want them to stay off welfare. This means
two things: one, they needjob training, and
two, the government must provide a high
minimum wage, one that you‘can actually
live on. And Republicans are against both.
I think this attitude all too often typifies the
Republican mindset: they are very good at
spotting problems, but they are very poor
at ﬁnding solutions.

Now, let‘s examine the Republican's
views in this debate. One common argu-
ment is to let the private sector provide for
the poor. In a capitalist system, this simply
won’twork, The motto inAmericais “look
out for #1” and they’re not talking about
Star Trek. And, let’s face it, this “private
sector solutions" bit is only a smoke-screen
to hide what the GOP really thinks, Let’s
hear it from one of their own: “Nobody
handed me anything. I don’t think I have
to share it with anyone. I did it, and it’s
mine,” said Rep. Sonny Bone. The only
reason the GOP even talks about possible
solutions is that it sounds better than simr
ply admitting that they don't want to help
poor people because they're greedy. But
let‘s look at what some other Republicans
think.

“Since the onset of the War on Poverty,
the United States has spent over $5.3 tril—
lion on welfare. But during that same pe—
riod, the ofﬁcial poverty rate has remained
virtually unchanged," said Robert Rector,
Heritage Foundation. First, there‘s no way
we’ve spent even 2/3 that much. And sec-
ond, we‘ve seen a phenomenal decrease in
poverty among the elderly, and poverty
overall has decreased 20%

“The social safety net that we
erected...has become a hammock,” said
Sen. Phil Gramm, First, Gramm should
know about getting money from the gDVr
emment, since (other than returns on his inr
vastments in porn ﬂicks) he‘s been getting
government paychecks his entire life. Sec-
ondly, you show me one person living com-
fortably and happily on welfare, and I’ll
concede you've got a point.

“Let’s reform welfare and demand that
able-bodied men and women riding in the
wagon on welfare get out of the wagon and
help the rest of us pull," said Sen. Phil
Gramm again. This cuts to the heart ofthe
issue. Republicans don't care about people
helping pull the wagon, they just want to
kick them out of it. Because, if they did
want welfare recipients to find jobs, they'd
be in favor of job training and education
programs, and a higher minimum wage.
But they’re against all ofthat. So much for
people helping push.

In conclusion, Ithink the question of wel-
fare is really a question of “What do we
owe our fellow human beings?“ It is my
belief that everyone has the right to basic
survival. Private citizens won’t or can’t
help. so the government must. I think wel»
fare needs to focus on helping people get
back on their feet and lindjobs oftheir own.
I think that ﬁnding ajob is 3/4 of the battle,
because people with a job have a sense of
self-worth: they‘re productive members of
society. I don‘t think anyone enjoys being
aleech,orlivingoffofthegovernment dole;
and I know no one is living it up off oftheir
welfare payments. But I think that, even if
someone can't or won't ﬁnd ajob, we still
owe them some means of basic survival.
And that means welfare. Money for food
and rent. The GOP loves to come up with
reasons why we shouldn't provide poor
people this, but all of them boil down to
this: they don‘t think people deserve it. Like
Sonny said, they don’t want to share.

I know that the majority ofrcaders of this
forum are not open to the idea that people
should be responsible for themselves in this
day and age. We have pretty much bred re-
sponsibility out of the American idea]. In-
stead I would like to simply state some facts
about modern day welfare and the conser-
vative reformation thereof.

Clinton promised to ‘end welfare as we
know it." When Congress sent him a bill to
reform welfare, he vetoed it. His own bill
required only seven percent of those on the
welfare rolls to enroll in the work program
by 1999, and they would only have to work
15 hours a week.

There art: 77 overlapping welfare pro
grams with a total price tag of
$324,000,000,000. or more than $3000 for
each taxpaying household in the Union. This
ranks it third among all governmental out-
lays (first is Social Security and Medicare,
second is general education). This is seven
times the amount (in inflation adjusted dol-
lars, no less) than the highest point during
the great depression.

In 1964, LE] announced the “War on Pov—
erty." Well, I am one the most dedicated
patriots (used to call them “chauvinists,” but
that term has been bastardized past any use)
in our land, but we have lost. Poverty has
smashed us, disemboweling our soldiers
(taxpayers) and puréed us into an nice, debt~
red sludge, just right for dipping Quad
chicken nuggets into. We lost the war be-
cause we didn’t ﬁght it correctly. We threw
5.4 TRILLION dollars at the enemy, and it
just ate it up. Let me give you an idea of
how much money $5,400,000,000,000.00 is:

You could pay the entire cost of World
War Two and still have enough money to
pay every man, woman, and child eight thou-
sand dollars. You could purchase every fac-
tory, all the manufacturing equipment, and
every ofﬁce building in the U.S. and have
enough money left over to buy every air-
line, railroad, trucking ﬁrm, and the entire
commercial maritime ﬂeet, every telephone,
television. and radio company, every power
company, hotel, and every retail and whole,
sale store in the nation. You might even be
able to pay the Clintons' legal defense bills.

Now that you know the casualties, let me
tell you about the enemy's casualties. Pove
erty has stayed pretty much constant. Welr
fare has helped bring illegitimacy up mani.
fold. Fewer poor people work nowadays,
and fewer of them marry also. Let me back
these claims up:

In the longest mnning (197171978), and
most comprehensive study done by the or.
ﬁce of Economic Opportunity, known as the
Seattle/Denverlncome Maintenance Experi-
ment (SIME/DIME) we ﬁnd that increasing
welfare benefits by 1 dollar to a poor person
caused an eighty cent loss in labor earnings.

Recent research by Dr. June O'Neill of
New York’s Baruch College, now Director
of the Congressional Budget Ofﬁce, con-
firms that higher welfare beneﬁts only cause
more people to stay on the rolls for'longcr
periods oftime. A 50% increase in beneﬁts
lead to a 75% increase in the number of
people on welfare and the length oftime they
were on it. It also lead to a 43 percent in-
crease in the number of out of wedlock
births.

Similar ﬁndings were found in a Fossett
study, Research by Shelley Lundberg and
Robert D. Plotnick (U of Wash), and Dr.
Martha Ozawa of Wash. U. A decrease in
the marriage rate was found in a study by
Dr. Robert Hutchens of Cornell U.

Let's look at the other provisions of the
Clinton plan:

rVirtually no recipient was required to
work.

~There were no limits on welfare.

VWORK (the name of the new work pro-
gram) participants were paid an effective
wage of 16 dollars an hour. The administrar
live cost alone for running each WORK case
was four thousand dollars.

Basically, the welfare bill Clinlon vetoed
required more people to work, it didn’t pc-
nalize women from marrying, and it didn‘t
reward them for having more children. It
gave incentives for states to stop illegiti-
macy, and does not reward states that in-
crease their AFDC workload each year.

A massive reform of the welfare strucr
ture would help all involved, but I doubt
anyone has both the spine to get the job done
and the public image to get elected. Our
national media viliﬁes anyone who would
attempt to reform the welfare state, and you
have to be pretty darn special to make up
for this disadvantage.

Why are we here?

By KURT ORZECK

Columnist

The pressure is building. Tomorrow, mid-
terms week begins, and I can already feel the
stress collecting in my stomach. Papers, ex»
ams, oral presentations within the next two
weeks, everything will be a big blur. I can
feel the same energy surrounding me, as well.
Everywhere 1 go, I hear students talking about
schoolwork Freshr
men, Judgment Week
is here. For us, it's
time to find out what
we're really made of
—if all those mindless
Spanish exercises we
did in high school can
help us now, if re»readr
ing and revising our
papers over and over will do us any good.
Indeed, Judgment Week is here.

The other day, I was returning to my room
after working in Quad when a couple friends,
Tom and Andy, called me into their room
Curiosity loomed over me. On their faces
were not the wide smiles of greeting I was
used to. They weren‘t angry, but instead very
contemplative. Frustrated. A little bit de-
pressed, ifl can go so far as saying that. Then,
Andy sprung the question on me: “Why are
you here?"

One of those questions, I thought. The

“I have seldom

come across more
interesting, intelligent
conversationalists. ”

deep, thoughtful, and often unanswerable
questions. Like “what is the meaning oflife’?“
or “why do good people have to die?" But
are these questions really all that extraordi-
nary? None of the words exceed two syl-
lables, and the questions seem so common-
place until they' are truly considered.

At ﬁrst, I wasn't sure what to say. Andy
mentioned how he could be learning and ex-
panding his mind so much more Without the

, guidance of college,
Through travel, for ex-
ample. l acquiesced, in
part, primarily because]
held the same sentiment
in high school. Literally,
I was more active in
reading, writing, and art
on my own during high
school as opposed to the
time I actually spent in
the classroom.

Over the course of the weekend, that ques-
tion ricocheted in my head, Sure, I had
thought about the notioh before, but it’s dif-
ferent when you reach college and become
settled. Then everything becomes a reality.

As I mentioned before, the classroom is
not always a conducive place for me to learn.
When I am alone, thinking. I often stumble
upon my most substantial thoughts. Also, I
used to read and write regularly on my own
in high school. Since I an'ived here, those

precious hobbies have drifted into non-ex-
istence. Atragedy? Perhaps. On the other
hand, I observe what has replaced those ac-
tivities, I talk with people more than ever,
and learn through that. Ihave seldom come
across more interesting, intelligent conver-
sationalists. In this way, I am learning be-
yond the classroom more than ever. For
years, I've grown and developed through my
own knowledge 7 now I am learning and
growing through others. One time, I pro
posed the following question to a friend:
“Would you rather live your life amongst
books or people?" Now 1 am finding a bal-
ance between the two.

One could always argue that social pres-
sures drive us into college. I agree that, for
many students, this may be true. Neverthe-
less, here at Grinnell I feel more comfort-
able than I’ve ever been. Here, I feel that
I’m being educated, that I‘m advancing as a
person. In high school, my senior year
schedule consisted almost entirely of self-
run classes. Now, though, I don‘t feel likeI
have to rely on myself to learn.

So, midterms week has arrived, and I feel
relieved that I set aside some time to con-
sider my true feelings about college, spe-
cifically Grinnell. ldon’t know fifl were
at a different school right now, maybe my
thoughts would be different. But I’m not.
I’m here. and ready for two weeks of mid-
term hell.

To the Campus Community:

Everyone has heard the saying in the Grinnell
1996 viewbook: “Grinnell is aplace that will ﬁll
your mind. . . Grinnell is marked by an unusual
blend of tradition, individualism, informality, in-
novation, academic vigor, diversity, and social jusr
tice. That is why—afar 151 years of educational
accomplishments4n'nnell remains a place
where important things happen." Indeed. impor-
tant things do happen at Grinnell—but do they
justify “innovation," “diversity," and “social jus-
tice"? Two important events that transpired at
Grinnell in the early 19705 were the takeovers
of Hurling Library by theAli-ican/Afl-ican»Ameri-
can students. During that time (and even now),
theAfrican/African-American students were dis-
satisﬁed with the ‘iibelal arts“ educan'on they were
receiving. The various departments failed to in-
Corpomte multiethnic people or their contribu—
uons into various curricula Moreover, the llblary
contained voluminous amounts of literature on
colonial and European history; any historical in.
formation on black culture conuiined the typical
“Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks" stories. In
an attempt to “diversify" Grinnell, the African/
AfricanrAmetican students at that time locked
themselves in Burling Library and deshelved the
books. They refused to unlock themselves until
certain demands were met. such as theirnplemen
lation of aBlack Library (which initiated onetaker
over), and the development of anAfrican-Amerir
can studies concentration (which initiated another
take-over; this concentration justbecarne fully de—
veloped last year, 1995).

To commemorate this event 25 years ago, the
black students, in conjunction with the other
multicultural groups, held a poetry reading on the
ﬁrst floor of Burling Library, Wednesday, Octcr
her 9, 1996. We hope the entire Gritmell coma
munityjoins in to recognize the eﬁons of the Afr
l'icart/Afrlcan»Arnerican students of the early
1970s

Dear Editors:

I am reluctant to draw everyone’s rapt at—
tention from the S&B's weekly comics, but a
quotation in one of your recent articles caught
my eye,

Last Friday, October 4th, in the article en-
titled “Students question privacy ofl-IIV test-
ing at Grinnell," Donna Bailey of Grinnell
Health Services was reported to say that “part
of the problem With HIV testing has to do with

educating people that this is a medical issue .

and not a social issue. Maybe if we continue
educating and being aware, possibly the
anonymous factor will not always be needed
in HIV testing." These statements struck me
as not only odd, but perhaps blasphemous,
coming from the mouth of a person so closely
related to the medical field.

Allow me to draw an analogy to illustrate
my interpretation of these comments. First.

' to say that HIV is a medical issue and not a

social issue is similar to claiming that death
itself is purely a medical concern, and not a
social one. To contract HIV is as near adealh
sentence as one would care to get, and that
unfortunate soul's grief translates to real so-
cial issues, What is more important, every
patient deserves the right to seek, ﬁnd, and
use medical assistance in complete anonym»
ity no matter the medical or social issues in
volved.

This leads me to Ms. Bailey‘s second point
and mine. She states “possibly the anonymous

factor will not always be needed in HIV Kestr
ing." To read this caused me great distress. I
am aware of only two issues in the world cone

sidered nonrprivate; family planning and HIV ,

testing. All else is protected by the impen-
etrable shield of Doctor-Patient Privilege, even
the aspects of your health that Ms, Bailey
would call simply “medical issues." Would
you visit the doctor if nothing were conﬁden-
tial? Suddenly, your recreational habits, your
sexual habits, your test results, everything
would be under the scrutiny of your parenB.
your children, and any other public or private
entities who cared to know. I value privacy in
all aspects of my life; in the doctor’s office it
is invaluable. Conﬁdentiality allows honesty,
and that allows patients to stay healthy: physi-
cally, mentally and socially.

I am sure that Ms. Bailey’s seemingly ill-
conceived declaration was meant in a much
better light, but the implication 1 perceived
could notbe left unopposed.

Dear Campus Community,

Coming out can be an act of pride, an act
of self»preservation, an act of love, a declar
ration of love. Coming out can also be a po—
litical act, an act of faith in the movement for
GLBT equal rights, or an act of faith in what
it could be. Coming out is often involuntary,
or simply a necessity. No matter what the
motivation, coming out is always an act of
great courage.

We Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual,
Transgendered, and Allied members of the
Grinnell Community applaud those who have
been honest in their affectional and sexual
orientation in the past, especially the GLBT
Grinnellians who helped make Grinnell the
supportive environment it is today. While
there is still a lot of work to do, in Grinnell
as well as in the greater conununity, we ac-
knowledge National Coming Out Day as our
day to celebrate the courage it takes to be
honest and accepting and proud. Today we
also look around us toward those friends,
family, and signiﬁcant others who are still
struggling to ﬁnd their courage to come out,
and encourage them to take the next steps in
their coming out process. We also thank those
who helped us find our place in being out
and who continue to work beside us in our
battles against ignorance and homophobia.

Every act of courage on our part is
empowering for those who will come behind
us, so we sign our names as encouragement
for those who still cannot.

Wednesday night a friend and Ihung posters
about Friday night‘s Corning OutCatwalk Style
party at Harris in the dining halls. When we
