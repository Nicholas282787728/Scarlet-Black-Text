SDAE campaigns
against eating pork

ANDY WEIDNER
STAFF WRITER

The debate over whether or not
SOA should fund SDAE'S (Students
in Defense ofAnimals and the Envi»
tanment) plan to tent a pig costume
in order to attract attention to their
Pig Outl campaign came to a close
on Wednesday night at the meeting
of SGA’S Jaint Board. The Board
voted no in {even ofproviding $75
tot appeatanees atthe pig costume at
dining halls on campus but rejected
the request for $25 to fund an off
campus appearance at one of the
local gtocety stores bya vote of13~5,

SDAE will apparently continue
with its plans to make an ortcamptis

According to Gross, the goal of
the campaign With the pig costume is
to gain publicity tot the issue ofanb
mal abuse and theteby eiicoiitage
people to become vegetarian or veg—
an. SDAE originally planned to en~
ter the meat section of McNaIly‘s
ivlth one of their members wearing
the pig costume and hand oul leaﬂets
urging people to “Go Vegetarian”
until asked to leave. at which point
they would leave the ptemises ea.

A number of Senators expressed
concerns received from their con»
stituents that such an action at Mc»
Nally’s might have negattve reper—
cussions With regard to so—called

“towngown” relations. They felt
thattownspeople mightinterpretthe
staging ofthis event at McNally‘s, a
(atnilyownetl business. as an indi—
teet attack on the iamily tam-iets in
the area.

Gross subsequently agreed, on
helialfofSDAE.torelocatethe event
to HyVee as a stipulation for funding
but is by no means obligated to do so
since the request for funds was reject»
ed, Gross latcr commented that he

ident who grew up on a hog farm and
has been involved in farming het
entire life, agrees that the pig cos-
tume escapade will be a “non—event"
in Gtinnell but also feels that be-
cause ofthe mannerinivhichSDAE's
cause is being ptesented, the message
will fallon deafears throughout Iowa.
In her opinion, most Iowans realize
how essential hog farming is to lo—
