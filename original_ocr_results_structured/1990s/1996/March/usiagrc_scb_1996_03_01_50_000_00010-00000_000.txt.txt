GtinneII Athletics:
Different

Equals

Exclusion?

As many of you may already
know, I recently sent an e—mail to
members of the community about
how I feel that my rights have been
violated as a student by the Athletic
Department. I wrote this letter in a
state of anger, however I do feel that
Iwas right in my feelings, Here are
the facts now that I am in a more
rational state of mind

After having a meeting with
Dean Duke and Dean Crady at
3:00am on the [WentyJI’iiI’d of Feb-
ruary, 1996, I was adVised to put into
writing my concems that certain
membersofthe Athletic Department
had violated my rights as a student.

upon leaving Grinnell (or win.
ter break, I was unsure as to whether
I would attempt to gain a ninth see
mester for various academic reasons,
I discussed this issue with Coachlen—
ny Wood. My knees were seriously
injured and it was questionable
whether 1 could ever run again. but if
I was able, 1 might attempt to play. I
assumed that the issue was dealt with
and proceeded to discuss my decision
with my patents My parents and I
decided that a ninth semester would
be best for me academically but they
questioned my return to soccer based
on the adVisement of a doctor. I
decided to leave the decision until
the end of the summer to see if my
knees were in better condition.

Upon my return to campus after
break I immediately set to work on
resolvrng my ninth semester peti—
tion. When schoolbeganl immersed
myself in my studies. and began to
move on With my school life. I was
working-out frequently and talked to
a coach about my knees. He advised
me to talk to a physical therapist of
his, and helped me to do so. This
therapist was helpful and With his
instructions I felt that I could atr
tempt to throw the jaVEIIn for the
track team. I never really thought
about soccer and didn’t know that it
was Coach Wood’s philosophy that
soccer was“all—encompassingand all
year round”.

Aroundlanuuty30, Iheard from
some friends that they wanted to talk
to me (as friends) about soccer. I
went to this meeting completely un-
aware of their intentions. At the
meeting I felt that they were attack—
ing me as a person and was hurt and
upset, I left before they really got to
their point. They told me that I had
to talk to Coach Wood, and that
they knew that I was angry with her.
I really had no idea what they were
talking aboutsonrote CoachWood
on the e—mail the next day and re«
ceived no response. That same day I
went to her office and she told me
that she couldn’ttalk to me then,but
that we could meet the followtng
week. I asked her if I could tape
record the conversation for my own
purposes and she told me no. I then
asked ifl could have a third party
observer, to which she responded
that there could be a third party, but

that she would pick who it was.

Idelayedthe meetingafewweeks
due to academic pressures. A day or
two before the meeting, on February
22 at 1:00pm, I received an eemail
messagesratingthatCoachFairchild
(the athletic director) would be at—
tendingrhe meeting. Becauseoipast
experiences with Coach Fairchild I
felt threatened and immediately
called Dean Crady because I knew
him to be a just man whose interest is
that ofthe students, He adVised me
on how to remain calm and told me
that it I telt that my rights were
Violated I should go to him directly
after the meeting and that we should
talk to Dean Duke.

Coach Fairchild was late for the
meeting and we began at 1:07pm.
Coach Fairchild set the tone of the
meeting by asking me ifl had a tape
recorder, I told her that Idid but that
it was not on. She insisted that she
see the recorder to make sure, and I
got it out of my bag and let her look
at it. She looked at both sides before
handing it back to me and allowing
Coach Wood to begin, This action
made me feel as if I was being treated
like a criminal and that we were
about to engage in some sort ofinter—
rogarion. In the Student Handbook
onpage86Itstntes:“CoIleg&poll 'es
call (or the exercise of goodwill, re.
spect, and fairness among all of the
college‘sconstituencies. lninterper—
sonal relations, the college seeks to
guard against any action or behaVior
that denieans a student’s dignity or
limits one’s freedom. ”

Coach Wood told me that I was
to listen first and then I could say
whateverl Wished. She talked ofhet
coaching philosophy in detail. focus—
ing onteam dynamics and goals. She
complained of havmg no communir
cation with me since I left for home,
and told me that she was waiting for
me to make the initiative to go talk
to her. She spoke of more than one
of my teammates who had up»
proached her with concerns of me
returning to soccer and said that she
advised them to talk to me. She
claimed to be unaware ofthe actual
meeting that occurred, but did know
that it did not go well. Again she
mentioned that there had been no
communication from me. She was
concerned as to what “all ofthis" was
doing to the team. As an example,
she stated that by not using the team
Watkeout, but rather mine, Heidi
VanHome was refusing to “buy into
the team philosophy". She told me
thatsoccerwasallencompassing and
alleyear round, She then went
through all of her points again and
told me that I did not fit in with the
philosophy of the team and that I
would not be permitted to return to
the soccer team. I explained my
position on the communication and
asked her ifthere was anything that
I could do to be allowed my right to
play (ifl so decided in August) and
she responded that her decision stood,
In accordance With the Student
Handbook, “Basic responsibility for
selecting members for a team from
among those who try out rests with
the coach. The criteria governing
choiceareUdemonstratedskillsand

Z) evtdence of commitment to the
sport and to excellence. other
grounds for selection or rejection are

117), During the season l am totally
committed to my sport and last sea«
son I set the all time single season
scoring record (which demonstrates
a bit ofskill).

AccordingtotheonevancePro.
cerlure outlined on page 118 of the
Student Handbook. the proper pro»
cedure is to discuss the “reasons for
rejection" with the coach and the
athletic director. Because the athr
letic director wm at the meeting, I
telt that she was giving her approval
ofCoach Wood’s decision. The next
step in the procedure is to “seek ad.
Vice and guidance from the vice-
president for student affairs. " (page
86). I immediately went to Dean
Crady arter the meeting. He was
unavailable for an hour or two and I
took that time to write a letter to the
community expressing my concerns.
Sometime atter 3:00pm, I went to
Dean Ciady and he told me that we
must next talk to Dean Duke. which
we did. He adVised me to put my
thoughts and experiences on paper
and tohand them lntohimassoon as
possible

I will now express how 1 feel my
rights were violated as a student of
Otinnellandexpresssomeothetcon»
cerris with the athletic department.
First of all the Student Handbook
clearly states on page [17 "All eligi«
ble students are encouraged to try
out for the teams of their choice." I
feel that this is also an issue of prin—
ciple. By removing my right to pate
ticipate on the soccer team, the Athr
Ietic Department is setting a ptece»
dent about who will or Will not be
allowed to play sports at Grinnell.
The issue here is whether or not the
policies of athletic department are
consistent with the philosophy of
Grinnell College at large

1 question what the Grinnell
policy is about athletics. Is it for the
purpose of educating students in a
sport setting and allowing them the
opportunity toparticipate,or is it for
the benefit ofthe coaches7 It was my
perception that Oiinnell was a place
of learning and that every student
was permitted to participate in what.
ever it is that they Wished regardless
of personal belief. The Grinnell
Academic Catalog 199596 states
that, “The sports emphasis at Orinr
nell is on widespread participation
and enjoyment of intercollegiate ntli»
letics (page 12). And the Student
Handbook states, “Grinnell College
supports intercollegiate athletics as
part of its overall educational pro»
gram" (page 117). Does it say any—
where that a sport should be all«
encompassing and yeanroundl And
if so, doesn‘t that place too much
importance on athletics in a liberal
arts college where athletics should
fulfill theroleof“intellectuallysatisr
fying and physically active leisure"
(page 1 Grinnell Academic Catalog
1995—96). If an Individual student
feels that playing yeanround fulfills
their active leisure then that is om:
thing But it is a different matter
altogether when a member of the

Department dictates what active ICI'
sure is. Why is it wrong for a student
tojust goout and play the sport when
the sport is in season?

While on the topic of Athletic
Department philosophy, more ques«
tions as io certain policies in the
department should be raised. For
example, why is it that a coach can
make training rules about what their
players do before a game and a profesr
sor can not tell the class what they
are permitted to do bctore an cyaml
Shouldn'tnllcducators.whethcrpro-
fessors or coaches, be following a
consistent policy as it pertains to
students7 Or is it the case that tyin—
ning is more important than educat—
ing In the College’s philosophy of
athleticsl Or is athletics a separate
entity alrngerherl i also question
why, iiwe do have a philosophy, we
do not play other schools with that
same philosophy. Why are we in a
conference with Coe which really
has nothing in common with our
school except that it is in lowa
Shouldn't we be playingschools that
have the same philosophy as our
school, namely, that athletics is a
part of education and not separate
from it7 Following are some quotes
from the Grinnell College Catalog
on the philosophies of the college.
Are these consistent with what was
preViously stated and with the phi—
losophyottheArhlericDepartmentl
“The values of liberal education »
criticaland unpremdicet‘l inquiry. free
and open discussion ofideas. and the
pursuit of knowledge as an end in
itself« distinguish it from other kinds
oflearning. To be liberally educated
is to be intellectually curious, and
the intellectual curiosity of each in«
dividual finds fulfillment in a course
ofstudy different in some ways from
those pursued by others. ."(page
30), That is what liberal education is
supposed to be. Is that what is going
on in the Athletic Department7

How is it that a player can be
removed from a team for ideological
reasons and a professor can not kick

differences? “Grinnell fosters criti»
cal independence in the context ofa

lntellectualand social diversity We
[Orinnell] support and encourage a
faculty of active scholars whose prit
mary mission is to teach [not to win]”
(page 1 Griiuiell College Academic
Catalog 1995—96).

1 would like answers to my ques—
tions, as well as for my rights as an
individual/student/player/American
[0 be reinstated as quickly and
smoothly as possible. I have faith in
this college and believe that a wrong
has been done and will be rectified if
I trust the system thathas beena part
oiGrinnelI for years. 1 believe that
Gnnnell is one place where individ
udls come together and work for a
higher goal without having to give
up who they are.
