Xandet Jacobs’ Letter
To the Editor:

As the coordinator of a highly
active and motivated student group,
I was greatly offended by a letter
which appeared in theS&B last week.
titled “Double Standard,” In his late
ter to the editor, XanderJacobs com<
plainecl that GEAR received money
from the finance committee to bring
a portion of the NAMES project
AIDS Memorial Quilt to campus,
while his group was denied funding
to demonstrate in town against the
pork industry. According to Jacobs,
funding was given for the quilt, not
because AIDS Awareness Week is a
college tradition, not because con»

tinuing cultural and educational
awareness about AIDS is the only
weapon we have against the pan«
demic, but because the college only
funds things which it considers un—
controversial. Insupportofhisview,
Jacobs seemed |o think there was no
differencebetweennwitingtheGrinr
nell community to come on campus
to view the quilt and a student group
going to a town husiness and openly
protesting.

It is my beliefthatlacobs missed
seyeral key points.

1) Events which occur on cam»
pusoccuronprlvateproperty. while
rownspersons are invited to attend
events, it remains their personal
choice, In order to draw a direct
comparison between the quilt and
the SDAE demonstration planned
for the town, GEAR would have had
to liangthe quilt outsitle a local htisir
ness and ask every person who passed
by to stop and look.

2) Though AIDS may not be as
“controversial" as Jacobs warns it to
be. it is nonetheless a disease which
has killed over 400,000 people, it is
a disease for which no cure has been
found It is the number-one cause of
(loathlornllpcopleage525<44 While
I do not personally condone the kill-
tngofantinalstorpeisonalconstnnp-
iron, I also hold the pieservation of
human he to be equally as impor-
tant. To say that the ﬁnance com.
mittee based their funding decision
on the easy—going nature of AIDS
grossly misrepresents the intentions
of GEAR, the finance committee,
and SGA in bringing the quilt to
campus.

3) As an organization currently
strivmg to improve towtrgown rela»
tionsthroughthe FirstAnnualGrin—
nell AIDS Benefit, I take offense at
being singled out for attack from an«
otherorganization which |5 unhappy

The fact is, many groups are denied
funtlingor receive a decrease in their
requests for many reasons. Just be—
cause you have a mailing list does not
guarantee you funding Second,SGA
funds are campus funds, not personal
funds. In making funding decisions,
I firmly believe that SGA must take
into account the desires of the mass
