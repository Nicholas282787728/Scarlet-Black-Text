8 - Feature

U.S. foreign policy consistently adheres to whatNoam Chomsky
Calls the "fifth freedom”—-that is, the freedom of the rich (us)
to rob and exploit the poor (the third world). This fact should
have crucial implications for how we live our lives, LASO is
sponsering a speaker in a few weeks (see box), and this feature
is intended to give a bit ofbackground, so that Vicki ’s talk can
be understood in the larger context of US and OECD global
imperialism. Rather than write one long article, which might
seem unwieldy, I wrote four which in terrelate. This feature is
essential to how the world runs. I urge you to read the articles
and consider the practical implications. I am happy to answer
questions and entertain debate. Thanks!

Global Injustice

70% of the planets resources are
used by the (20%) richest countries,
Ifone goes simply with the rich peo—
ple, the figure goes to 20% using
95%, The richest ﬁfth of the global
population presently has 150 times
the income of the poorest ﬁfth (that
gap has doubled since 1950. directly
as a result ofUS and Bl‘elton Woods
policy); over 80% oirhird world cx.
ports are consumed by the 5% of the
global population who have iirsr
world educations and who own and
run ihese countries. And our nation,
at less than 5% ofthe global popula—
(ion, drives as many miles as the rest
of the global population combined.

Meanwhile, fully 1.3 billion peo-
ple on our planet live in whar the
World Bank calls “absolute pover—

Latin America’s 420 million people

to recall that this is an intentional
policy of Bill Clinton and the US
Congress as they attempr to extend
NAFTA “to the southern tip olAr»

global cop, the United States also
plays global extortionist.

Intentionality

The most impor—
tant thing for us to re
alite is that a policy of global star-
vation is intentional and calculat—
ed. Once we realize this, so much
