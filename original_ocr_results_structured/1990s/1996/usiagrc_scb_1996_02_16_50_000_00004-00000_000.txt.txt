Dear Todd,

Do you recall Arthur Dent’s
struggle with the beverage machine
in Douglas Adams‘ Hitchhikers
Guide? The contraption analyzed
the nutritional needs and taste prefr
erences of potential beverage coir
sumers, then invniiably produced
something which was “almost, but
not quite. entirely unlike tea.”
Arthur's obstinate fight to obtain tea
from the machine is one or my favor.
ite Stories on the relationship ofthe
average sentient being. to rapidly
advancing technology. , . it's such a
nice metaphor, I think I’ll steal it.

There has been much political
(uss lately. Various politicians have
come to tell us that, after analyzing
the needs and desll’es of the Amati»
can people, they are willing to pro-
vide what we need and want. Let's
propose an equation. “r”=wltat l, as
a potential politica l consumer. needs,
“s”=what I desire. “t": the ideal
politicalproductfori-ne. t+s=t, right!
No, actually. My political desires
can contradict each other or my po—
litical needs, For example, I can
need a welletiucated populace bur
desire not to spend additionalmoney
on Schooling (the last isn't true, but
it could happen). Analysis ot‘ my
political needs or desires may be af—
fected by survey bias. had modeling
at situations. ignorance, irritability,
etc.

If “r“ can't be determined, “5"
can’t be determined, and it’s impos—
sible to meaningfully add "r“ to “,"s
"t" can be hard to pin down. Still. I
continually look for"t,” and continc
ually vote for someone who’s almost.

but not quite, entirely unlike “r,“

Of course, there’s a great differ—
ence between Arthur’s situation and
mine. Arthur searches for some
thing which disappeared from the
universe, anal I search (or something
which never existed outside ofglossy
nostalgia. Give my selection (orpresr
ident adecade affora death by assas—
sination. and we'll forget, think he
was the real thing. wonder why we
can't get that in this universe any—
more. We gaze into the may otthe
political machine and demand our
ideal. The machine isn’t designed to
produce it.

After all this philosophiang, it’s
hard to remember whatI was going
to say. Oh, yeah. Don't you hate
those incessantcommercials on tele—
vision where each candidate harps
on the {act that the other candidates
ate imperfect.l (I know, I’m not sup-
posed to be watching television. I’m
supposed to be doing my home—

SKA originated inlamaica and that
reggae musician, Bob Marley, ivas

music. The first type is called “SKA
Core" which has punk music influ»

called “Rock Steady” which tends
to have more ofa reggae style The
third type ofSKA is “Traditional”
whichalsohasareggaestyle. Wyatt
says that horn instruments predom—
inate in SKA music and give it a
distinguishing quality Wyatt and
Mullins have become great fans of
this mom that they describe as fun
and upbeat.

While Wyatt and Mullins la—
ment that KDlC’S SKA collection
is not as large as they would lilte it to
be, they have heen acquiring more
SKA titles recently. Wyatt and
Mullins play popular SKA groups
such as the Mighty, Mighty Bos<

MullinsplantofeatureaSKAgroup
