During the past couple of \\ eérs

Since Republicans have gained

control of Congress, many of their.

measures have been deemed “meam

spirited" by Democrats and many
members of the media. lt is not the

intention of Republicans to he mean
or insensitive. Thei are notstnrvlng

LWhile Democrats continue to

attack _Republlcnns from Lthe left,

Republicans are making some right
decisions. For example, Americans
overwhelmingly support fiscal re—

become an important issue (or the

A sccand i in about which Re—
publicans and Democrats disagree is
that oftbe role ofstato government.
While Democrats desire a strong,
centraltedguvemment, Republicans

issue, which (or so long has been

decided by federal law, has rccchrly
been changed by many states as a
result of the current Congress grant—
ing more legislative power [0 the
state level. By allowing stares to
have more legislative autonomy, as
with rhc speed limit example, each
state legislature can tailor laws to fit
the nature or their own particular
state.

Finally, Republicans reinforce
the belief that congressional terms
are not lifelong, and incumbents
should beheld more accountable for
their actions The newlyrelectetl class

Republicans have stated that they

The majority of Republicans also
believe that term limits would cut

There are many more issues
that l have not touched upon,

only so much space with which to
work. So my advice, especially to
those ofyou who cansideryourself

issues don't get resolved by re«

The Democrats

SARAH EAGAN AND J EFF LAKE

The Democratic congresses in
the pastand the Clinton administra—
tion have always upheld the interests
of American citizens. Our party has
championed civil rights, spearhead-
ed environmental protection, and
built a program of safety nets and
health care for the elderly and disads

Under intense pressure from
Republicans in Congress, and With
