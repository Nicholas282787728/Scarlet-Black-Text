Co—founder of
bagel company
returns to Grinnell

Nordahl Brue, co»founder of Bruegger’s Bagels,
will speak about entrepreneurship at 4:15 pm.
Wednesday, Sept. 25, in the South Lounge of the Fo-
rum at Grinnell College.

Brue, a 1967 graduate of Grinnell, started
Bruegger's Bagels with Mike Dressell in 1983, open
ing the ﬁrst bagel bakery outlets in Iowa City and
Albany, NY. While bagels may be a household word
now, in 1983, Brue and Dressell had to give them
away,

“If we had done the market research, we would
have said, ‘Why bother?‘ There had been no bagel
bakeries in Iowa and, therefore, there was no known
market for bagels.” Brue says in an article in The
Grin/tell Magazine.

“We knew that if we could get people to try
Bruegger's bagels, they’d come back," Brue says,
And they did. Although Brue merged Bruegger’s
Corp. with Quality Dining ofIndiana, he and Dressell
still own and operate 145 stores as franchises. includ—
ing the stores in Iowa and Minnesota.

Brue has shared his success story through many
speaking engagements, as he will Wednesday night.
He encourages other entrepreneurial-minded indi-
viduals to follow their dreams.

“If you can be talked out of it, you should be
talked out of it. But if you can’t, there‘s no other
answer than to go for it. Most of the successful en-
trepreneurs I‘ve known couldn‘t be deterred from
what they wanted to do. Drive is independent of ﬁ-
nancial ramiﬁcations," Brue said.

Grinnell Productions
to build new theater

By MELINDA JONES
Staff Writer ‘

Grinnell Productions, a nonprofit pro-
fessional theater company, has recently
purchased two buildings on Commercial
Street in southeast Grinnell, the Spencer
Storage Warehouse and the Foster and
Bailey Building. Renovations are well
underway to convert the buildings into a
playhouse and center for the arts.

The Davis Playhouse, so named for
Grinnell native director and playwright
Hallie Flanagan Davis (1889-1969), will
seat 150 people and will feature a 45’ wide
by 20’ deep stage with a Victorian
proscenium arch.The theater‘s architec-
tural structure will be modeled in part af-
ter the Colonial Theater which used to
stand on the corner of Fifth and Main be
fore being demolished in 1974.

Grinnell Productions, the group behind
the Davis Playhouse project, is a collec»
tive of theater professionals and artists
dedicated to the development and produc»
tion of works that celebrate the diversity
and resilience of the human spirit; works
that both enlighten and entertain. Its
Board of Directors consists of seven
working theater educators and profession-

als whose lives have present or past links
to the community of Grinnell, one of
which is Grinnell College Theater Depart
ment faculty member Pip Gordon.

Professor Gordon has high hopes and
expectations for the success of Grinnell
Productions’ goals in association with this
project. One of these goals is to broaden
arts and entertainment In Grinnell.
Grinnell Productions seeks to achieve this
through providing a place to consolidate
resources for all the arts groups in
Grinnell. The Davis Playhouse will not
only serve as a permanent home for
Grinnell Productions Inc. theater com~
pany, but also Will provide an alternative
performance space for the Grinnell Corn-
munity Theater and a venue for music
recitals, concerts, dance recitals,
children's ntovies, and cultural films, to
name a few.

Another goal of the Davis Playhouse
project is to help rejuvenate the Commere
cial Street district. Once fully underway,
the Davis Playhouse is expected to fea»
ture entertainment every weekend. “We’re
hoping it will really help the economic
level of downtown," Professor Gordon
said.

Students travel to hear
Clinton and Harkin speak

By DAVID BURNETT
Staff Writer

On Sunday, September 15, approxi-
matelyJJO Grinnell students boarded
charter buses bound for the Tom Harkin
Steak Fry in the town ofIndianola, Iowa.
The Harkin Steak Fry, which is a fund
raiser for the incumbent Iowa senator,
featured speeches from actor Torn Arnold,
Senator Tom Harkin and President Bill
Clinton.

The Grinnell Campus Democrats
worked in conjunction with the Harkjn
Campaign to organize the excursion to
Indianola. Student tickets for the Steak
Fry were sold for ten dollars and included
admission to the Steak Fry and lunch. The
I-Iarkin Campaign paid for the rental of
charter buses to help transport Grinnell
students to the event.

The I-Iarkin Steak Fry is an annual
event, and this year it attracted over
12,000 people. Of the 12,000 attendants,
1,800 were college students. In propor-
tion to the size of schools, Grinnell Col-
lege sent the most students per capita to

the event.

Tom Harkin and Bill Clinton spoke on
a wide range of issues, but the central
theme oftheir speeches was “Building a
Bridge to Our Future." “Both the candi-
dates spoke on issues that were important
to the audience," Anne Tillerna ‘99, the
co-Vice President of the Campus Demo-
crats said. “ Indianola is a farming com-
munity, and they had a lot of students
present, so they strongly addressed their
positions on agriculture and education."
According to ﬁrst»year student Leah Ray,
President Clinton and Senator Barking
spoke on education, womens‘ rights to
choose and need-based state relief.

Sarah Eagan ‘98, President of the
Grinnell Campus Democrats, said, “In
particular women’s issues went over very
well, and so did educational issues. When
Bill Clinton signed the new welfare bill,
it didn’t go over very well with a lot of
Democrats. Clinton spoke about this in
his speech, and he tried to justify his ace
tion. I think he was able to show that It
was politically necessary for him to sign
a welfare bill."

Alice in Wonderland

“1 know who I was when I go! up this morning, but I think
I must have been changed several time: since then. " saidAlt'ce.

“Explain yourself! .

"lcmltexplain myself, [In afraid, Sin" said/Wee, "be-

Wonderland

Lewis Carroll, friend to little girls and
guardian of innocence, would undoubt~
cdly be shocked were he to stumble onto
campus this weekend and witness the res
newal of what has become a moderlt
Grinnell tradition inspired by his Victor
rianvcrzt childrens' lalcs Alice's Adverts
tures in Wonderland and Through the
Looking Glass.

Then again, perhaps Carroll wouldn't
be so bemused at all. The people behind
this year's Alice have sought to preserve
the spirit of Carroll's work in both the
planning and preparation for the event
while maintaining the elements ofthe fes-
tival that are unique to Grinnell.

Mike Dziegiclewski (‘99) and organizer
ofthis year's activnies, said “We want to
create a mad hatter atmosphere. an

unbirthday party with a festival spirit."

Dziegelewski became involved with the
happening earlier this year after talking
with Joel Pargot(‘97), who helped plan
Alice last year and wanted to make sure
that the tradition was maintained and in
capable hands. Dziegelewski took over
and began preparation for Alice three
weeks ago. This year the college provided
serious financial support for the effort, al-
lowing Dzregelewski and the other orga-
nizers to “start out with huge plans." They
recruited Daniel Rogge(‘97), who ar-
ranged the rental of an excellent sound
system for the numerous bands who will
be playing, and expanded the range of ac7
tivities planned throughout the afternoon

and evening. _ ,
