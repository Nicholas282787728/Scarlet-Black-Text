Bruce Ftiedtich’s Opinions

To the Editor:

I am writing this to express my
support for Bruce Friedrich. who has
received a good deal of negative at»
tention this semester for his column
and the ideas which he has presented
in his features page. i do not ivisli (o

iiilmr I am going to say. However, 1
think that we need to consider the
possibility (lam: Mt. Friedrich has
threatenedoursense ofsecurityabit.
and ifthat is the case. then maybehe
has something to offer us. What I
mean is that perhaps by exposing a
flaw in the foundationsofoursecuri—

This is not, however, where the dis—
eiission ends. Once we recognize our
role in the injustice that is baing
played out globally, we have a real
chance to combat that structure.
