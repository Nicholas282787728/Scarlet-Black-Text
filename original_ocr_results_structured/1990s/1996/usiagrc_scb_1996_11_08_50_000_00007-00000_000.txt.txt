27:} die ediﬁces

To Students:

There is a fear which I have that I be-
lieve many other people on this campus
share, This is a subject which promotes a
variety of strong vrews and is a part of the
large area of Racism. It has always brought
a distasteful feeling to my stomach. We
would all like to assume we are not racist
or even subtly racist. I have often shunned
instances dealing with this subject arid at;
tempted to distance myself from them in a
similar way as many other people do. Partly
because of the recent events on campus I
have decided to state my Views upon this to
hopefully overcome the fear it creates in me.
An idea which I have heard about in the past
couple of years, which is the purpose for
my writing ofthis article, is the idea of what
could be called "subtle racism". Tltis con
cept was explained to me as meaning subr
consciously, or possibly purposefully, as4
suming something about someone because
of the color of their skin or culture. The
term "subtle racism" could be made more
encompassing if called “subtle stereotypr
ing." Some people stereotype or classify
others into many areas such as religion, so~
cial class, political affiliation, and musical
preference Then they likewise making use
sumptions about the people in these groups,

The term "subtlet‘actsm" is involved with
a certain conflict which happened around
campus over a Gum article. The following
is what I have heard were the arguments of
the two sides, The group behind this article
seemed to think that this article was a sar-
casm about an organization by the name of
A.S.I.A. They seemed to believe that it was
just a satirical ad. This article was not in-
tended to be racist and possibly the accus»
ers were being hypersenstttve, and did not
understand what was taking place.

A few concerned students believed this
anicle to be racist against theAsian cultures,
This article could be interpreted as being
subtly racist because of a certain stereotype
about IheAsian cultures which some people
have. Thepeopleagainst the articlebelicvcd
that they were not being hypersensitive be-
cause this portrays a problem that peoplc
have. and should be brought to light and
dealt with.

There are many examples of subtle rac»
ism. One example may be to picture two
friends talking. on: is Asian American
while the other is white, The Asian Amerir
can asks her friend what major in college
he thinks she is studying. He ﬁrst guesses

engineering, She then says "you told rnc
thatjust because I‘m Asian." He could have
guessed this because he placed her automatic
cally into his stereotype of many of the
Asian cultures which may have been that
they are engineering oriented, which could
have been subtle racism, What if in reply
to her question on a major he thought, “I
don‘t know anything about her area ofstudy,
she could be any major for all I know. I
could state opposite majors then narrow the
ﬁeld by what she says, I will pick what seem
to me to be absolute opposites, how about
engineering and theater.“ So he first states
engineering, now that sounds more like a
misunderstanding than subtlc racism In
the example when she said "you told me that
just because rm Asian." This might be
thoughtol as subtle racism in itself, yet that
can not be assumed wrtliout knowing her
full reasoning behind that statement first
Now imagine what might be said after this
dialogue between the two people, "oh, i
wasn't assuming this because of your race"
or something along that line. Now that
throws the people right back into the circle
of subtle racism and fear of it, or anger at it.

My first experience with this idea of
subtle racisin was when a man at my church
was telling me that he ncvcrthoughl he was
racist but that he realized he had the ten-
dencies to be subconsciously ractst Then I
took a sociology class in my senior year in
high school which very much increased my
own particular understanding ofthis phrase
subtle racism. This Class showed me all
these possibilities in how groups are orgre
nized and all the ways to classify people.
The tcacher took a certain pleasure in mak
ing assumptions about people in this way.
Classification is a natural part ofthe brain
process in memorization to an extent. Could
you imagine not organizing or sorting any
thing out in your mind? There would be
too much information which would be re»
pcatcd many times aiid would probably be
quite impossible. Also organizing yourself
into a group may be good if it is for the in-
tent of achievrng a positive goal.

I had been taught all these ways of being
racist which 1 would never apply in think»
ing about people, yet it created a great fear
in me that I could be mistaken as racrst,
Several times these past couple of years I
have caught myself having to be careful in
communicating (all forms including verbal
and physical) on some occasions for fear of
being misunderstood, notjust merely misc

understood, but being misunderstood as a
racist. If i watched whatldid thorougiily,
then I would never be misunderstood as rac-
isi (as impossible as that may be). How
ever, wouldn‘t I then becomea subconscious
racist, because in being careful I would have
to think of all tlic things I shouldn‘t do to be
misinterpreted, even though I would never
do them in the first place. In instances when
i begin to act this way, i find myself to be
subtlyclasstfying. ifa pcrson evcrdoes act
as a subconscious racist, then they should
be informed so they can correct themselves.
When people who are not subtly racist have
a fear ofbeiiig misunderstood and are more
careful in how they speak, a barrier is cre-
ated in communication between people.
This can be considered similar to the term
politically correct. Ifa person worries about
this and is careful about what they say. is
that not a form of denying oncs self from
how they truly are. and being what they are
not? If onc actually believes what one is
stating then one can support what one says.
Walking on eggshells could lead to great
problems. These problems can include Cree
aling problems with onc‘s self respect and
self-assurance. These problems can also in
clurlc how people and groups deal with each
other. Again, when this happens, an invis—
ible wall is built between the two people
communicating which makes communicar
tion much harder. Our society seems to be
walking on eggshells more all the time

I have found that most of my fear is un-
founded and has no reasoning behind it ex-
cept for the fact that it was instilled upon
me, When people inform others ofracism
of this form, it should be done in a positive
way in order that they do not create fear.
Many people have a problem with subtly
assuming things about others. People eas-
ily use generalizations to describe the typi-
cal, clearly»stated (not assumed) character—
istics of a certain group. This clearly does
not put these characteristics on all people
in this defined group. yet some people tend
to believe (or assume) so. There are many
ways to resolve this vicious little circle.
Information and knowledge are always a
very good way to overcome stereotypes.
The phrase Celebrate diversity is also a very
good term because when people accept and
enjoy the differences amongst one another
this whole idea of racism and subtle stereo-
typing make no sense. Even though this
sounds like the mostsimpleconcept, please
do not assume anything‘about anyone until
you hear what they have to say, because
through my own experiences I have found
that this is most often the creation of mis-
understandings, and when ever you have a
question which arises speak up!

Sincerely. Bryan Stewart ‘00

Most of my friends are aware that I spent
a few years in the Air Force before attending
Grinnell. I was stationed in the Philippines
and often worked with a man named Wiley.
We were both helicopter mechanics and he
was about as easygoing as most lucid people
tend to be. Well, one day wc were fixing a
problem with the tail of our bird when I said
to him that I was looking forward to our
thrce- day Weekend coming up Wiley just
continued working as he told me that he’d
rather not have the day off. Sometimes Wiley
could be a little add, so I asked hint wlty he'd
rather work and he said, “Cuz I don‘t want
no day off fer no goddamn communist." I
laughed. It was Martin Luther King, It.’s
birthday. Acoininunist YWas he serious.7 He
continued speaking: "He was iiothin' but a
troublemakcr, sliouldajust minded his own
business.“ I thought he was nuts and told him
so. His reply was dis-
arming and simple:
guess you and l have ti
difference of opinion."
And that was that. We
fixed the tail, our shift
ended and we wetit
downtown and had a
beer in one of the 500
strip bars in the Philip
pines. We remain friends
to this day,

So does the story and here? No. but I won-
dcr how many people liavc stopped reading
because they feel I don't agree with them,l
And yet, I haven‘t condemned cillicrsidc in
favor of the other. Ironically, when I wits in
the Air Force, it scented thtit whenever I dISr
agreed with my mostly conservative friends.
I was branded a liberal. Here at Grinncll.
however, I am usually labeled conservative
when I have an alternate political viewpoint
The difference is that my friends in the mili-
tary didn't dcfinc mc based solely on my
social or political opinions

.1 We, as a
campus, need
to learn to
communicate
as friends and
not as
adversaries,

As I stated, Wiley and I remained friends
and during the course of our time in the Pliilr
ippines, wc would discuss race again, as well
as many other things. I learned a lot from
Wiley, as did he from me. In time, he learned
not to think of Martin Luther King as a come
munist troublemakcr, Now I’d like to say that
he came to admire King as much as I do, but
I can‘t. Perhaps one day he will, but for now
my friend is a little more Openrmlndcd than
before we met. This wouldn't be the case lfI
had called him a racist pig or an uneducated
fool when we first discussed King. This
wouldn't be the case ifI had looked at him
With disgust, lectured him and then said, “Get
a clue!"

Can you imagine how you’d feel if, after
posing a question or making a statement to a
prolcssor in class, he or she replied wrlh
“That's ridiculous! You'ie an idiot, this isn‘t
brain surgery!“ and then rcruscd to talk to
you. My experience has been that the over-
wlicliiiiiig majority of professors licic are
eager to see their students
succeed. They enjoy teach
ing and will tell you that
they always learn some
thing new from their stur
dents, Isn‘t this friendly.

condition of our campus. If you want to
make a difference, then find someone you
believe to be your adversary and talk to him
or her 7 about anything. Just talk. Sound
unreasonable? simplistic? Real change is
hard work. Martin Luther King knew this.
so did Gandhi.

Changc involves an everyday commit»
mm. It involves forgetting past differences
and moving ahead one day at a time, one is
sue at a time, carefully reminding ourselves:
Iwill noipassjudgmenl, i will not make blan~
kcl statements, If someone hurts me, I will
tell them and expect a sincere apology and
nothing else. IfI hurt someone I will listen to
what they have to say and sincerely apolo»
gize. Still, some people wtll refuse to let go
ofthciropinions and angcrand willspew their
sclfrtightcous venom, undermining any ef-
fort toward rcconciliatron. Some will con-
tinue to be insensitive and aloof, arrogantly
dismissing the feelings of others while 0b-
structing any effort toward peace and friend-
ship There’s not a damn thing we can do
about that. But we don‘t need to follow their
example.

I'm not going to argue over terms or defir
nitioiis, I'm not going to defend myself
against a charge of raClsm or hypersensitin
ily. Do you think I am either ofthesc? That‘s
okay, Sll with me anyway Talk to me and
not at me Maybe you can teach me somcc
thing, and maybe 1 can teach you Unrealisr
tic? Life is more complicated than that? Say
what you'd like, roll your eyes, but it seems
to me that this kind of effort by all of us sure
as ltell beats the tensron iii the air now

It was motley group of men and women I
worked willi in the Air Force, all of whom
had no more than a high school education at
best, Hell, I swear to God some of them
sniffed glue as children, And then some were
the most decent, hardworking, intelligent
people 1 know. If they were able to work and
live together amicably, lhtzn weshould be able
to create a more peaceful temperament on our
campus.

Fall Break in the Windy City

BY KURT ORZECK
Columnist

It‘s weitdjumping from small-town rural America into the bean ofa bustling bigcity, Grinnell
prides itself on its normalcy and quietudc. Chicago, on the other hand, boasts more excitement
than one could imagine, with trains roaring, businesspeople hurrying, and cars speeding

I amved in Chicago on the ﬁrst Saturday of break. Adniiltedly, l was still trying to catch my
breath from midlem’is |he week before. However, I was nevertheless excited to be in one of
America’s most prominent cities. One of my chief concems was whether fall break would
actually turn out to be a break or not. With so many sites to see, record stores to check out, and
activities to attend, I was pretty ccnain I'd be even more tired upon reiuming to Grinnell than

When I reached the Wiitdy City, I was immediately seized by a flurry of skyscrapers. Sure,
I've been to Boston, New York City, and plenty more metropoli, but after spending two straight
months in a flat world where a fair-sized tree looks overbearing, I could not help bul be awe-

Ah, I thought, Chicago. I took a deep breath ofcily air, and coughed out the fumes of smoke-
stacks and car mufflers. Lichise. within minutes of my slay. I was smacked with my ﬁrst real
headache in awhile. Stepping onto a city bus, I was ready to begin my eight-day Chicago adven-

In order to get the full effect of my expedition, realize Lhat I can be one of the most frugal
people you‘ll ever run into. Over the span of eight days, Ionly are out four times. The rest of my
meals consisted of almost nothing but cereal, Oodlcs of Noodles, and peanut butter and jelly
sandwiches. In addition, over the course of the first weekend, I did more walking thanI had done
in a long time. I walked to the Art Institute, Wrigley Field, the Sears Tower pretty much

Also, the week felt so much longer than atypical week here at Grinnell. Just as the ﬁrst week
here seemed so long, so did my week in Chicago. I suppose new places with new offerings have
that effect. The days may have lasted the same number of hours, but they certainly didn’t seem

The week drew to a close, and although I was tired as predicted, I was utterly satisﬁed with my
stay in Chicago. As much as I appreciate the natumlncss and tranquillity a smallaiown setting
offers, I cannot help but long for high-paced, cosmopolitan life.

Though I am from a small suburb myself, here is different. At home we get a newspaper,
watch television, and see cars. I wouldn‘tever side with television, but at least it kept me in tune
with the rest of the world. HercI have never felt more apart from current events and the general
public. To a degree, going to Chicago plugged me back inlo American society for a week.

Nevenheless, it's great to be back at Grinnell. On the second Saturday of vacation, I returned
here. At first, I was mildly disappointed. The majority of students hadn't come back yet, so the
place was nearly deserted. I switched once again, this lime from bustling to well, honestly,

 

Now I‘m not bored. Activities and classes are roaring with vivacity once again. Classwork
is piling high once again, but what can I say except that that’s a large part ofihc reason we‘re

Ican only hope that winter and spring breaks go equally well as fall break. Going into
fall break, my intention was clear: to see an unfamiliar city for a solid week with friends and
have an experience I’d be able to tell plenty of stories about. As far as I’m concemed,

What I saw there was amazing: mem-
bers of the College community standing in
front of a packed Harris Center giving a
taste of what was on their minds. It was this
semester‘s incarnation of racial tension,
which can be traced to the Gum‘s "mock"
ASIA ad. There was a powerful display of
perspectives, feelings, and ideas. Some
were more coherent than others, some were
reactionary, some were passionate, and
some were logical; but they were all genu-
ine, they were all valuable. I heard power-
ful arguments and saw interesting points of
view. But there are so many powerful, in-
telligent statements I have heard in these
past weeks that aren’t getting enough at-
tention. I have heard definitions of racism,
ideas for solutions, personal experiences re-
lated, But an understanding of any ofthesc
sophisticated ideas require one thing as a
precursor and that is what I am going to
speak about.

Many issues surrounding this problem
are controversial, but what I want discuss
is something that we should all be able to
agree on, something that should be obvi<
ous. I want to write about being sensitive,
and about being open-minded.

I know that we all like to feel conﬁdent
in what we know and that it feels comfort-
able to have an opinion on every issue. I
understand it's easy to disregard the expe-
riences of others when they conﬂict with
our own. But these are not excuses for in-
sensitive, arrogant, and lazy ideas. I've
heard many claims that those of us con
cerned with the ad are “overreactive,” This
bothers me.

There were many reactions to this ad.
Some of them were more emotional than
others, and some ofthem were louder than
others, But each reaction was personal. I
accept that some may feel that some reac-
tions were less solution-orientated than oth-
ers, However statements like “they overre-
aeted," and “they are hypersensitive" are
not legitimate.

Just because we cannot relate to some-
one else‘s pain, we have a different reality,
and a different set of experiences does not
mean their pain is an exaggeration, a show
for a little attention, or illegitimate.

I have heard a comment said by some~
one that IS like so many 1 have heard on
this campus. This panicular person, a foot-
ball player, said that the Gum’s reference
to the ‘mistake of getting drunk and going

home with a football player' did not bother
him. So he didn’t feel that we should b5.
offended by theASIA ad. This way of think»,
ing is not legitimate.

Consider a friend who is upset because
her grandfather died. It‘s obviously not le-
gitimate to say “Well my grandpa isn't that
great; frankly I wouldn’t care if he died -
you're overreacting.”

It is also inappropriate to say. right after
the funeral: “Wow. I wouldn’t give a damn
if my grandpa died but you look troubled.
You‘re crying. Tell me exactly why you
hurt. Justify your pain and explain your
frustration. Tell me what experiences in
your life made you love your grandpa,
prove to me you were close to him,“

Funher it is not appropriate to say: “Are
you sure it really bothers you, or do you
just need an outlet for all your creative en-
ergy?" It’s not right to say: “Well the pur»
pose of his death was not to make you sad,
there is no intent here. He didn’t ‘intend’
for this whole death thing to bother you, so
quit won'ying about it, no harm done."

When there are hundreds of students on
campus that are angry. when you hear the
frustrated tears of someone's voice through
a microphone at the Forum, and when your
friend from India ignores you when you ask
her, saying you want to feel her pain, about
“the whole Gum thing" in the middle of a
computer lab it is not because they‘re over-
reacting, it‘sjust their personal reaction. No
doubt, that‘s the easiest way to deal with
someone’s emotions that you don't under
stand, but it is arrogant and insensitive.

Of course we like to think that our atti-
tudes are open-minded and fair. Butjust be-
cause our friends from home think we‘re
really liberal doesn't mean we’re experts
on other people‘s pain, or that we are pil-
lars ofsensitiviiy and empathy. Just because
we like to consider ourselves sensitive and
open-minded doesn’t mean we can stop
thinking and relax. You have to ﬁght to keep
an open mind. It's difficult not to be inscn»
siiive, Do you think that people had trouble
looking at themselves in the mirror before
the Emancipation Proclamation or that men
whose wives couldn‘t vole had trouble
sleeping at night? Do you think a family
sitting down to dinner on the land a Iapa»
nese-American was forced to sacrifice for
a cot in an internment camp had trouble di—
gcsting? You have to work hard to negoti-
ate what your society tells you is accept—
able and what your heart tells you is fair. 1
know it‘s difﬁcult, but I’m arguing that it‘s
worth the effort,
