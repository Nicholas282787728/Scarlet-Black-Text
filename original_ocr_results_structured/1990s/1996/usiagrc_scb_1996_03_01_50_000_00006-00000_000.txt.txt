With a biweekly column, I nev—

discuss before a new one captures my
attention, Therefore, tobacco com»
panies won’t be the focus of this
week's wrath. With the state not

he's so worried about marriage, he
should take what families he can get.
Ultimately, I felt rhe hypocrisy clos-

more local situation. After the ole—

keep our activism to ourselves), un—
able to control my embarrassment
and exasperation, I e—malled a re

changes made, it reads as follows:

ignores the issue. Moreover, and

This is rhe yearorrhe eorser for
Rachel Farris (‘96) who plays one of
three principle roles in the play She
Stoops To Conquer which opens
March 8th, This Will he the second
time this school year that Farris will
have ro don the righotirrrng 18th
century gatbnftetplayingaprinmple
role in The Cherry Orchard last fall.

According ro Farris, She Stoops
To conquer, alternatively titled
Mistakes or The Night, is an 18th
eenrury soap opera. “It’s a laughing
comedy written after the sentimen-
tal comedies of the era which were
Very moralistic." Farris plays Kate
Hardcastle, an intelligent, goodne—
rured girl who, rhrough an arranged
marriage, is betrothed to a man she
has never rrrer, On rhe way to meet
his future bride, Hardcastle’s fiancee
gets lost and must ask for direerions,
He is told the way, but erroneously

believes that the directions he re«
ceived were for an inn rather than
the l‘lnrdcnstle abode. The mix—up
resulrsin anumberofsillysltuations
which are eventually resolved wirh
no harm done.

The role ofKate Hardcastle is an
interestingone because ofits duality,
commented Farris. Hardcasrle rec—
ognizes her future husband early on
in the play but notices that he is
embarrassed to speak to the cultured
Miss Hardcastle. She therefore dee
cities to become a barmaid to win
him over and teach him to be more
confident. “It’s a fun role ro play,"
commented Farris

“Everything’s coming rogerher
really well," added Farris. ”The cos—
tumes are fabulousithe women’s
costumes were made entirely from
scratch.” The play, which has been
in the works since the beginning of
the semester, should prove to be en—
tertaining. In the words of Farris,
“it’ll be a big rompl”
