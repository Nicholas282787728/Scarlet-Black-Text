BY DAVID BURNETT
Staff Writer

On Tuesday, November 5. a new
art exhibit by Tony Crowley opened
in the Print and Drawing study
Room of Burling Library Mt',
Crowley, an Associate Professor oi
Art at Grinnell College, litlcd the
exhibit “At This Point In Time —
Twelve Weeks in the 150th Year "

The exhibition consists of a col-
lection of monoprints that reﬂect
some of Mr. Crowley’s experiences
at Grinnell. While explaining the
process of creating the monoprints,
he said, “These are made by rolling
or brushing stilTpriiiting Ink onto the
surface ofa plate, manipulating it to
create the texture or shape desired,
and then printing the image onto a
sheet of paper using a printing
press."

The images rep
resent some of Mr.
Crowley’s more
significant expert
ences d tiring
Grinnell’s SSSqulr
centennial celebra-
tion. “As with any-
thing else in which
humans are inr n
volved, the College now
has its good and bad
points," said Mr,
Crowley. “The
works in this exhibit are an interpre-
tation of those contrasting qualities

 

 

“I wanted it to be
clear that I... am
focusing on what
life is like in
Grinnell here and

Professor Tony Crowley's exhibit will be on display in the
Bailing Print Study Room through December 8.

 

as I understand them " Many of the
monoprints share the slime common
forms, but each conveys a different
meaning by have
ing contrasting
colors and pair
terns By using
different printing
techniques, Mr.
Crowley builds a
visual vocabur
lary through the
Opposition of
p o w e r to | ,
weighted images
representing the
ambiguities that
are present in eve
eryday life.

Mr. Crowley said, “While each

configuration has significance and
meaning for me, I don't expect them
to be ‘read' by all observer That is,
ldon'l expect them to communicate
an idoii, in and ol themselves, to
someone looking at them," The line
ag in the exhibit are nonrobjeeltvc;
tltis means that there is no recognize
able subject in the works, Mr.
Crowley did. however, Select spe
citic titles for cltch print so the min
derlylng themes and mcttnltigs are
somewhat evident to the vtewcr.

Mr. Crowley‘s images represent
occurrenccs lit the artist's life durr
ing the past year, The works portray
the abstract representations of
events, conveisattons, and actions by
others which have had some kind of
impact on his life,

in pioptii ing the exhibit, Mi.
Crowley worked wnli Combinations
of shape, color, and texture lit order
to suggest space, form. and surface,
while retraining from pOIlIZlylllg are
llial objects Tile artist said, "While
this may make it harder {oi the ob-
servei to understand the wot k. it also
trees them at the burden ol‘precon-
cetvcd notions that they often bring
to recognizable subiects,"

According to Mr. Crowley the
thcme oi the works, the signiﬁcance
or the title, the inspiration behind the
prints, and the underlying meaning or
the exhibit are all intertwined As the
title ofthe exhibit suggests the works
explore Mi. Crowley‘s perceptions of
Grinnell College today, He said the
title is signiﬁcant because, "I wanted
it to be clear that l'in not looking
back llostalglcally at the College‘s
history or reputation btlt am focus-
ing on what life is like in Grinnell
here and now 7 at this point in
time." Mr, Crowley first began pre-
paring thc works about a yeai ago,
but as the title also suggests, he
worked on the exhibit for 12 weeks
during the height or the sesquicenr
tcnliittl celebration.

Mr, Clowley's nonrobjeelive ex-
hibit ofthe Grinnell’s 150th year will
be on display and open to the public
through December 8. The exhibit is
in the Print and Drawing Study
Room in the lower level of Hurling
Library.

‘A Rumble in the Bronx’ is
funny and action—packed

BY DAVE) REED
Film Critic

In A Rumble lit the 81mm, Jackie
Chan plays a man from Hong Kong
who comes to New York to attend his
uncle‘s wedding. The uncle sells his
store, which sits in L! bad neighbor
hood, and recruits Chtin to help the
new owner until his uncle returns from
his honeymoon.

Chan defends the store from a gang
and gains their enmity. The gang
spends much ofthc tilm chasing Chan
in order to avenge their humiliation at
the store. We discover that the sister
of the crippled boy who lives across
the hall from the uncle's apartment is
the gang leader's girlfriend

She mends her ways and she en-
tcrs into a relationship with Chan. In
the background ofall ofthis, the gang
accidentally involves themselves with
a powerful crime lord who wants the
diamonds one or the gang members
stole from him, Jackie Chan must set
things right with the gang and with the
crime lord.

A Rum/Ila in the Bronx 15 pure fun.
"the action ﬁlm does not take itself
very seriously and provides the audi-
ence with an enjoyable ride. The bad
dubbing distracts one for a little while,
but this soon passes. At times, the ﬁlm
preaches lo the audience along the
lines of“cztn't we alljust get along?“,
but it does not detract from the movie
and plays a very minor role in the film.
The action continues almost non-stop

from the lime Chan encounters the
gang in the store. The intricate chore-
ography of the “ﬁght scenes" cause
some excitement and a few laughs.
The movie’s action creates very little
bloodshed, which is a refreshing
change from the usual “Chock full ‘0'
explosions" action movie that per»
vadcs the market today. The stunts are
pretty simple, but admirable when one
keeps in mind that Chan does all his
own stunts,

Several stunt mishaps play with the
closing credits. The movie even cm,
plays some comic elements, which
add some giggles to an already enjoy-
able movie. Iwould recommend this
movie as a great way to spend acouple
ol‘houts on a Friday or Saturday night.
A Rumble in the Bro/it appears in the
Forum on Friday night at 8:30 pm and
on Saturday night at 7:30 pm.
