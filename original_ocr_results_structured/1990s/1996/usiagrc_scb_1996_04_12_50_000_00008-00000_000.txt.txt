From the Right Letters to the Editor...

BY DAVID RUDEL

Views of the 80’s not 20/20

“During the 1980’s, our govetw
ment betrayed the values that make
America great...\X/hile the rich got
richer, the forgotten middle classi
the people who work hard and play
by the rulesw took it on the chin .No
wonder our nation has compiled its
worst economic recordin tittyyears."

These are the words of Bill Clinr
ton. I picked this quote because it
exemplifies the constant attempts by
liberals (both in Washington and in
the media) to make the years when
Republicans were at the helm seem
putrid. Not even taking into ac«
count that BillClinton should be the
last person talking about “values,”
and ”playing by the rules," his words
are almost pure rubbish For years
the media and politicians have been
trying to tell the nation that the
eighties were a time to shun forever
economically. They say that the rich
just trounced on the poor and that
the economics of the eighties were
bad all around for the nation. They
say that employment went downhill
or that whatever jobs that were cre»
ated were just burgerrﬂtpping level
sludge. They say the rich did not pay
their fair share and that tax cuts
created our huge deflcﬂt They say a
lot oi things, but they rwnl out {me
president with regard to honesty (In—
teresting quote by Srephanopoulos
on Cllnton: “He kept the promises
he meant to keep")

Let'sjustlookobltatwhatrenlly
happened in the cyil eighties. A
common theme, whichstill pervades
the realm today, is that there was,
and is, no class mobility. This rumor
has been one of the reasons for wel»
fare’s increasing. However, the record

shows that 86 percent of those fami—
lies in the lowest income quintile
(fifth) moved to a higher class by
1988. In addition (and this is really
startling), 15 percent of the poor
went to the highest quintile in those
years. This seems to imply that more
poor people in 1979 had moved to
the highest quintile by 1989 than
had stayed in their own, This is not
a property of an economy that dis—
couraged class movementi This
movement also means that many who
were rich moved down, dispelling
the “rich get richer“ paradigm,

my rumor; however, some would say
that this economic explosion was
due to the huge deficits incurred durr
ing these years. To this I would
simplyanswer that there are two main
\vztysztdeficit can increas . ncreased
spending or decreased revenue,
When Reagan’s tax cuts kicked in
(fiscal 1982), the numbers showed
that lowering the rate could lncvense
the total revenue. The deficit was
caused by wild spending due to a
Democratically controlled congress.
Now, in all honesty, a good chunk of
this spending went to the military,
hutlasltyou. do you {eat that the us
is going to be invaded soon by an

Reagan, and you will find that it was
not the case.

Oh,yeah,aboutuneniployment.
Three hard facts are as clear as black

color the Census Department and
Department of the Treasury use- unr
employment dropped to about 3/4 its
previous percentage, 18.6 million

Why I Cannot Turn to Goal for Refuge
To the Editor:

I am writing this letter in IL“
sponst in Etln Mtcorinally's colt
won in the April 5, [996 issue ofthe

5&5. Writing about her father's
brain aneurysm and resulting com—
plications, Erin stated, “I have been
able to find refuge in my belief in
God," for help in dealing With the
pain of“wzttchlngsomeonc you love
suffer, and being unable to relieve
them of that suffering." I have writ—
ten this letter because I wanted to
explalnwhy,whilelsympathizewilh
the pain that Erin has felt due to her
father’s illness, I am unable to find
thesame refuge tnreligiousfaiththar
she has.

My rather has lung cancer. It is
inoperable. He will die from the
cancerorfromcomplicatlonsrelated
to the cancer. For me, there is no
comfort in a beliefthat God provides
“some sort OfJLlStICe for the souls of
the dying to be found in a world
much kinder than this one." While
I share in Erin’s enjoyment in the
overwhelmingly positwc nature of
his, 1 feel that it would be hypocrit—
ical of the to worship a God who
allows pain into the world. How
could I thank God for “the growth of
green plantsantt. thenantitltoithe
sun,” while cutstng him for (he suf-
tering which my other and those
who love htin must endure.7

I suppose that people withstrong
religions raith can instiry their heliei
in a God who allows our world to be
fullofwar,hate, and anguish, but it is
impossible for me tojustify honoring
a God who causes or allows all of the
painandsufferingthathumanitymust
endure. Like Erin, I have accepted
that there is nobody I can blame for
my {atlicr'scanccn UnlikeErin, I am
unable to have faith in a God who,
aside from letting my father suffer
and slowly deteriorate, forces me to
endure the suffering Concomltant
with my iathor's long trek towards
death.
