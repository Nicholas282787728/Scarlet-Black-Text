According to the May 2, 1958 is—
sue of theScarle! and Black,
Hancock participated in ajazz col-
loquium in which'he led a19»piece
student band which played “Top
Brass," an original composition by
Hancock

During the time he attended Grinr
nell, Hancock was also playing in
thejazz clubs in Chicago alongside
such great musicians as the saxo-
phonist Coleman Hawkins and
trumpeter Donald Byrd. After
graduation from Grinnell,
Hancock traveled with Byrd to
New York where the two of them
recorded with the Blue Note re»
cording company.

Blue Note immediately offered
Hancock a chance to lead his own
band and, in May 1962. he come
bined with several other musicians
to record the record Tokin'Off, an
album that had been described as,
“one of the most accomplished
debuts in the annals ofjazz." The
album contained the song “Waterr
melon Man,” which has since been
recorded by more than 200 other
artists.

In May 1963, Hancock played
with the Miles Davis Quintet and
over the next five and a half years
developed what the New Grove
Dictionary ofJazz calls “a highly

Herbie Hancock's performance last
night in Darby Gymnasium provided
the student body with a unique op
portunity to hear this greaijazz piar
nist and composer, The concert was
the culmination of a series of came
pus appearances by Hancock, who
graduated from Grinnell In 1960.

A release from Verve Records de-
clares that “as no other artist,
Hancock has deﬁned the high end of
1322, from composition to improvi-
sation, from hand leading to arrange
ing."

Although Hancock had been play
ing piano since the age of seven, he
entered Grinnell as an electrical en»
gineering major. By his sophomore
year, however. he had changed his
major to music composition, Dur-
ing his sophomore year, he had
formed a l7»piece band and had be-
gun arranging and composing his
own musrc,

On January 10, 1957, Duke
Ellington played in Grinnell: on the
following day, several band members
invited Hancock tojam with them in
Younker Lounge and “for two hours
captivated the audience as they un-
inhibitedly and effortlessly impro-
vised." The recording ofthis session
may be found in the Iowa Room in

 

 

 

lessly executed rhythms, graceful
melodies, brilliantly creative and
catchy riffs, and an atmosphere of
urban contemplation laced with
joy."

Hancock devoted much of the
1970‘s and early 1980’s to the
more commercxal style of music
that made him a superstar. During
this time. however, he still mah-
aged to tour with the likes of Chick
Corea and Wynton Marsalls, and
the old Miles Davis Band.

In l983, Hancock cowrote the tune
“Rockit”, which reached No. l and
showed Hnncock's ability to work
with complex electronic music.

as one ofthe world‘s foremost pia-
nisis and as a talented composer of
small-group material.

In the midr70's, Hancock formed
a quartet and recorded Head/1101b
art, which become the bestselling
JaZZ album in history. It was a
more commercial album than
Hancock had recorded before and
demonstrated the inﬂuence ofsuch
musical styles as rock, funk, and
disco. Jazz: The Essential Cortl-

Grinnell graduate undynzz innovator Herbie Hancock is on campus
this week as part of the Sesquicentennial Celebration. Hancock has
offered ltopc for many Grinnellians that the time spent in this isor
latcd institute can someday lead to the fulfillment of dreams.

From my first experiences witlljazz I have always felt Hancock’s
influence I was given the chance to spend a few minutes With him
as he talked of his Grinnell experiences and how they inﬂuenced his
life and music.

As a Grinnellian, Hancock felt the frustration of spending his col-
lege years in a small town miles i’rem any large cultural center. “It’s
so funny because there were only about‘threc students at Grinnell
who could playjazz." Hancock was determined to make the most of
his situation, so he formed a big band.

“I had never arranged anything in my life before. But I was listen-
ing to records and figuring otlt thtl each instrument was playing. I
didn’t know it at the time but I was really helping my cat. That par
ticular semester I went to almost no classes, I crammed for about
two weeks and I got As on all my finals "

After leaving Grinnell. Hancock returned to Chicago without any
clear goals in mind. “I hadn’t made 11 plan. The way it worked out
was better than any plan Icould’ve made anyway." Hancock Went to
New York with Donald Byrd where Miles Davis found him.

He credits the experiences that all Grinnellians share for his feel-
ings about life and music “We've all been altered by the same phi»
losophy. . . . Music is about life. If you spend your time isolated
from life and all you have is practicing all the nine, studying music
all the time, and that‘s all you do, then your music is not going to
have anything to say." ,

Hancock has always been an experimenter. He has worked to bring
his interests in technology together with his love of music: He has
also stayed in touch with popular music because of its accessibility
by more people.

Many of his albums, including his most recent release, have put
these interests together, and ltave done it very successfully. We
Grinnellians can be reassured by Herble’s life and work by searching
here in the cornfield: we will eventually find some answers.

 

 

 

New exhibit opens
in Print Study Room

 

 

 

 

from a Grinnell College press release

Pastels and pottery by Jill Davts
Schrift, lecturer in art at Grinnell
College, will be exhibited from Sep-
tember 6729 In the college’s Print
and Drawing Study Room at
Burling Library.

Schrift's pastels depict European
landscapes, in and around the
French towns of Eze, Vezelay, and
Nice, and Brugge, Belgium. While
most feature landscapes only, one
pastel captures the concentration of
a solitary musician in a park, and a
second the morning walk of an 807
yearrold woman and her dog.

"The woman was very. very
French. She and her dog had
stopped to rest, and I snapped a
photo of her as my husband and I

were out walking one early morn
ing," Schrift says. Schrift works
mostly from photos and sketches,
sketching the pastel in charcoal first
and then layering the colors with
Schmincke pastels from Germany.

"In my pastels, I try to capture the
image of place, the beauty of the
landscape, the memory of the time
I spent in that plnce,'j she says.

Within the exhibit at Grinnell,
Schrift has included several large
pots. The pots have been thrown
and then built up using coils ofclay.
The pots are glazed and fired, some-
times using a Japanese method
called "raku," where the pots are
fired to a hot temperature and then
thrust into a combustible material,
she says.
