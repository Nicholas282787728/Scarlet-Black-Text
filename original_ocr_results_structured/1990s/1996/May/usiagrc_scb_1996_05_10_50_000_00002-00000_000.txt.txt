Sick:

Or Why I’m Glad There’s Onl

Week Left (with
Silverstein)

“1 cannot go to school many,"
1 said in my Grinneiiian way.

“I lost my keys. my 1D broke,

l have no change to buy a Cate

Today my sack lunch had no knife.

And soc controls my tire.

My backpack’s seams have ripped from srmm,
And Rudel‘s ranting hurrs my hram

My nanieired srare has reached new heights.
I haven’t slept in rwenry nighrs,

My eiasses suck, I’m always iare,

My GPA is one—pernr—eighr

I don’t know where my friends all wear,
(My maii's addressed to “occupant"),

lhaye no like, 1 am so lame,

Not even Sheila knows my name

My roommate said I had no clue.

Then took my snared bear hostage, too.

I’m tired but the MIME: weak,

I’m ineeherenr when i speak.

My PC crashed at 3 AM,

I'm failing English, calc and chem.

My ﬁnals schedule — it sucks rocks.

l'vc sixtccn papers, resrs, and mile a

And there's one more, that’s seventeen,

My prols are all insane and mean.

They’ve crushed my spirit (or iyiii. soon),
insr like an old post—waltz balloon.

My papers are not long enough

Though some say that l merely hiuri,
(i know i am a wortiet

But balfa page on carrier!) \

l haye no ink inside my 7 whari
What's that? What's that you sayi
Classes are all done today?

0h, geadz i'ii work some other day."
