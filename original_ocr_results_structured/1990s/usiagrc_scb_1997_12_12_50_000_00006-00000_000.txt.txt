The sec-

team capitalizing on the othei’s misr

“I can honestly say that this is one
of the most fulfilling athletic experi-
ences I have ever had,” exclaimed
Coach Wood, “Last year we were
upstaged by Clarke’s relentless press
and lost by a large margin. This year
we stayed focused and demonstrated
what we can accomplish.”

This focus was sorely missed
against Hannibal La~Graiige as the
Pioneers‘ performance was, accord-
mg to Wood, “very disappointing,"

“In our preparation, we talked

about having a let down after a huge
emotional victory," remarked Wood.
“Unfortunately, this apparently did
not sink iii as we learned what can
happen when we are not mentally
ready,"
, While the cagers executed fairly
well, shots would not fall and
Hannibal took control of the game
very early on, never looking back.
This led to frustration between playr
ers and in the end, the Pioneers were
downed by 48 points.

“At the half, the game had nothr
ing to do with winning and losing, it
had to do with a reinstatement of
team unity," said Wood, “We got
upset and this frustration was canted
out in our treatment of one another
on the court, While it was a difficult
loss to endure, I think that we have
learned from it. thus making it ben-
eficial. Now we must implement
everything that we have learned this
season and hopefully our progress
will be demonstrated this week

Men’s b-ball riding high after
consecutive wins

Sports Information

Coming off two consecutive ex-
hilarating wins, the Grinnell College
men’s basketball team enters the fi—
nal stretch of non-conference games.
On Saturday the Pioneers host
Cornell at 7:00 in Darby Gym.

Coach David Arseneault com-
mented on his squad’s upcoming
games. “This is the week before ex-
ams which usually means part of the
team gets scattered. No matter what
happens this week, we have prepared
ourselves for the Midwest Confer»
ence with a solid non-conference
schedule. It would be great to get
two wins and eiitl the semester on a
high."

Arseneault’s troops are riding a
high after two victories last week
pushed their record to 32. The Pier
neers produced a ISCOrdeselting night
in a 1377109 victory over Clarke last
Wednesday. They stole a victory on
the road from Martin Luther last
Saturday, 141-137, In overtime.

Against Clarke Jeff Clement
broke his national record of 16 three
pointers in agame by nailing 17. The
junior sharpshooter knocked home
17 of 38 three-point shots, and seven
of eight free throws to score 58
points.

Scott Wilson also produced solid
numbers by hitting seven of 13 ﬁeld

goals, including six treys, and three
free throws to score 23 points Taha
Jackson added 19 points.

Four Pioneers. Aris Karakalos,
Luke Flokerzt, Daiiilo Juvane and
Brad Ruhoff, led the squad in re
bounding with 51X apiece. Ruhoff
was tops with six assists whileBryon
Witzel posted four,

The Grinncllians produced solid
shooting numbers by hitting 42 of
97 from the ﬁeld and 32 of 78 three-
point shots, a national record,

At Martin Luther the cagers came
out active defensively but were very
cold shooting. The hosts pushed to
a33v11 lead in the ﬁrst half but Grinr
nell fought back, cutting the deficit
to 59752 by halftime, Martin Luther
maintained the lead and with 3 min-
utes left had a positive margin of 14
points, With 56 seconds left Grinr
nell tratled by 11 points.

Scott Wilson helped mount a
comeback by hitting two three-pointy
ers, going to the foul line for three
foul shots and hitting a third trey,
Martin Luther kept the lead with foul
shots and seemingly iced the victory
with two free throws to take a [brace
point lead with eight seconds ten
maining. Jackson pushed the ball up
the ﬂoor and dished it to Clement
who hitadesperation, 35-foot three-
pointer to tie the game at the buzzer.

In overtime Grinnell got its ﬁrst

lead of the game on a threeepointer
by Craig Alpha, The Pioneers
pushed the lead to nine points but
Martin Luther nailed three treys to
cut the lead to two points. Danillo
Juvane hit two free throws with four
seconds remaining to ice the game,

Wilson led the charge with 56
points on 18 of31 shooting from the
ﬂoor. He scored on 12 out of 20 of
his three-pointers, Clement tallied
28, Jackson added 12 and Troy
Dougherty scored 14,

“Scotty was unconscious," re-
ported Arseneault. “He got good
looks from the are, he used his
strength well inside and he got to the
foul line."

“As much as I liked the win, I felt
bad for the other coach and team.
They hustled very hard butjusl didn’t
shoot well from the line. My heart
goes out to them," concluded the
coach.

 

The S & B will
return after Winter
break on January
30. We Wish all of
our readers Happy
Holidays.
