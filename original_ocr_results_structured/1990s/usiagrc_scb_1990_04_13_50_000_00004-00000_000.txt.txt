forinunces with Bob Truze of Ad-
missions.

Tltis is part of Sparks‘s desire to
see the group broaden its horizons.
Already. throughdortn study breaks
and all-campus events. the group
has more than doubled the number
of performances of last semester
and farexceexled those oftheentire
previous yeart ltslatestet‘fons have
concentrated on getting off cam-
pus. Having spent last summer in
Chicago, Sparks observed an im-
prov group that managed to raise
enough money to get itself to Scot-

surely we could get off campus,"
said Sparkst

And they have.

eled to the Funny Bone Comedy
Club in Des Moines to do a charity
beneﬁt for the homeless

“People were paying $10 a per-
son to see us,” said Sparks. “it was
very ﬂattering"

Proteus also arranged for the
University of Iowa’s performance
troupe. No Shame. to perform in
Arena Theatre last Saturday night
No Shame is a different kind of

performance troupe; its members
rehearse set pieces. not all ofwhich
strive to be funny. This event was
the second half of an exchange;
Proteus had already performed last
month at U of It

Craig Hooper and Brandan
McClain, both freshmen, will take

Box Breaks Studying Monotony

By Maria McCanhy

Packed with people, Arena
Theatre was barely big enough to
accomodate the crowd that showed
uptosee the firstblack box break of
the year last Friday

“Up till this year, it‘s been a
theatre department tradition," said
Carl Thelin. who organized the
black box in conjunction with Jim
Caccarno for the simple reason that
no oneelse seemed tobedoing any-
thing about it. AcmrdingtoThelin,
there are usually about six black
box performances a yeart

“But this year. the department is
very relaxed. so it never gotoff the

ground." said Thelint
A black box break is an open
fontm for expression on any topic.

Generally the atmosphere is casual
with a variety of both impromptu
and rehearsed performances
One tradition, which Thelin and
Caccamo performed. was the read-
ing of the lyrics of a song. They
chose “Hanging Tough" by New

A group of people performed a

several musical performances.

The black box break only lasted
aboutan hour and twenty minutes,
as opposed to the usual three hours.

“I think that a lot of the people
that were there had never been to a
black box before," explained
Thelinr “For example, very few
people sauntered over to the food
table; that’s what people usually
do."

Overall, however. Thelin thinks
the reaction was positive.

becomes an impromptu choir; the
dream game, where the team ques—

and emotional symphony. where
each team member acts out an
emotion on a cue from the director,
wilh the result being a chorus of
emotions.

The two Harold teams, “Instant
Loomer” and “I Say,1 Say, Boy,"
utilized all three games in last
Sunday‘s performance.

A Harold is distinguished from

things that
have actually happened.

“Every day life and this—and-
thardhings which happen to you
are funny,” said Henson,

Henson and Neill hope to
perform as much as possible in
the remaining weeks of the semes-
ter, preferably every week as well
as on Peace Day. Both feel that
it would be bestto keep the core of
people they have now and practice
more before they teach the Harold
to anyone else. Both also stressed
that the group is not in competi-
tion with Proteus: the two types
of improvisation are very differ-
enl.

“The creative environment of
one should be able to stimulate
the creative environment of the
other." said Neill.
