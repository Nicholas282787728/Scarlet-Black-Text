Editor bids farewell to Grinnell

By RIVA SHARPLES
Editor in Chiet

EALLY, an editor's parting words should bc full of truth, humor and wit. the

final testimony of one about to graduate and to say goodbye to die newspaper.

owever,as I prepare to close drcGrlnncll chapterofmy life and to open a new

one at graduate school injoumalism, I instead suhinit to you a mix of nostalgia and

wishes for Gnnnell‘s future that I hope will trigger some introspection into the way
we treat our fellow Grinnellians.

It’s funny how different things look
when you're almost at the end. Finishing
one part of your life and moving on to n s
anotheroﬂencztusesreﬂection,and, like many othersentors I've begunlothlnk about
all oftlie friends, living and dead, thatI will leave behind as I go on to ﬁnd anew place
in the world. At the crowded tables in Quad, Ilalk, like many other seniors, about
how I should have spentiuore UIIIC with friends and less on lhoseunnecessary nigth
spent stressing but not getting anything done. And that acting class I always wanted
to lake 7 why didn't I ever sign up for it? Unfulﬁlled dreams and missed
opportunities — those seem to be some of the thoughts on scniors’ minds.

Andso CarpcDieni,thatofienrepeated,yeti-arely followedlaunmotlo,should
inspire us to action. Let'sconcentrate on the things rhke friendships and the things
that we wanttodo-- that in theoveiall schemeof things mattermore than grade point
averages and studying that extra hour or two. I'm not saying that academics aren't
important and that students shouldn't study, but sadly, as Americans and over-
achievingGrinnellians, we seem to have gotten the seizing thecareerand degree part
of Seize the Day down, but in the area of human relations, we‘re still lacldng.
Gi-innellians should not wait to practice what they preach or to treat each odier with
tespectand kindness. We shouldn’tbe so bogged down in ainarsh of petty, artiﬁcial
divisions and unnecessary name-calling on this campus 7 or in work for that mallet

s *

 

— that we stop drinking ofpeople as individuals but rather as stereotypes.

After all, when all is said and done and you graduate from Gnnnell, what does
all oftlie narrowerrundedness and categorizing get you? Judging people as people
is much more real and fulfilling than seeing them as types,

On a ﬁnal note, I’d like to thank this semester’s staff for their hard work and
dedication. You‘ ve been great! Additionally, I‘d like to Wish next semester’s editor
in chief. Dan Buettner, the best of luck, I’m conﬁdent he will do a wonderful job

LETTERS

To the Editor

ents coordinator defends

six-person security team
I am writing in regards to the editorial
[about] Hams security in last week's s &
B. As All Campus Events Programmer
I am in charge of Security, and several
points in the editorial merit response.

FIISL the author states that Titular
Head was the first time that she feltsecue
n‘ry was everneeded atl-larris. The author
needs to gelout more. The Security crew.
working alongside the Harris staff, has
had to remove students because of une
wank-d behavior almost on a weekly ba-
sis. The author claims a wet dance ﬂoor,
not drunk people, are to blame for most
problems. I agree that beer spills pose a
threat to the safety ofsludents, but [don't
believe, forexample, that beer sprllswere
responsible forsevei'dl women being Vere
ballyandphysicallyhanassedafewwccks
ago. ldon’tbelievel-larris workerscalled
anambulancetohavebeerspillsremoved.
Beerspillsaren’llheculpl‘lis in lhenumer—
ous potential ﬁghts that the Harris crew
has stopped throughout the year

Second, the author makes the claim
that “Harris Security is supposedly there
to control alcohol " Because the author
used to work security, one would think
that shewould know that this isnot the job
ofsccurity. Security‘s job IS to keep the
people and thebuildingsafe. Checking to
seeth'dt only people ofagednnk isthe job
of the party organizer and the party orga-

nizers sign a contract that says they will
only serve to people who are 21, or
course, we all know that undemge people
are drinking, but it Security, who are
employees oflhe college, were in charge
ofslampingllands,llley wouldbcnllowcd
no leniency [and] would be required to
obey the law, lithe author still waan this
new proposal, site needs to discuss re
vamping the way the entire college is run.
(That whole “$eng0vemance" thing.)
lite biggest problem with the edits
rial, however, is how little the author
seems to understand the concept ofptc-
venlian. She says that having secunly at
every doorarldhavlngsix peopleworking
is a waste of resources. People would use
the exits if there was no security sitting
there. She asks what the big deal is about
taking alcohol out of Hams. Onc purpose
of Harris is that it is a controlled environ
ment where people can have run. If
people were allowed to lake alcohol out-
side, they would be bicakmg [the law].

Stumblewoed will stay together despite graduation

By SARAH STAVETEIG
Arts & Entertainment Editor

May, the month when most cam
Fus bands Wind down,

Srltnlbleweed is gearing up. Half
of the hand graduates this year, yet the
groupseemsresigtledtotlourish. Last
night, they played at Gttbe's in Iowa
City Tomorrow, they will lake part in
the HUMdcbutufband compilations,
marking their third recording. Anti
this SLlmI!‘|6\',5Illlll/II€WBEII hopes to
play in Iowa City.

Even wtth this success, the blind
does not hold any pretenses about its
ptirpose, nor its music. “We're not
getting together to be on a mission to
make it big," said junior Jen Rose
(drums) “So we're not in the habit of
talking about ourselves and thinking
aboutourselves Welrkeplayingthe
music that we're playing."

“Weallkindofknowhowloplay,
Iguess,"addedscnlorCharlesMaynes
(guitar). “Nobody sucks. But we're
not the most technical band.‘Y

Stuniblewud freely admits that
originality is more important than
playingtechnically well, To Mnynes,
their music is about “taking stuff
that’s been written on acoustic gui-
tarandtryingtotransl‘eritonto elec-
tric and make it so it doesn’t sound
like shet."

Members cite inﬂuences from

tive musw, but the result was (lee
scribed as midwcst. guitar-focused
music, “Its allcoming from lhlsfolk

“I don't think I could play itr
becausel‘mprobnhly notgoodenough.
but I like to think that I don't want to
play it, so it doesn’t really matter,"
summarized Maynes.

With their songs being released
tomorrow on the I-IUM compilation
CD. the band is pleased about getr
ling their name out. They prefer ilot
to have to promote themselves.

"I think [the CD] will help with
name recognition," said Weinstein.
“The bigger help will be how many
people besides us would be pushing
for us to get shows. We have the
hardcsttimetalkingaboutourselves.
so when other people are doing it tor
us it helps."

Stimiblcweett is not breaking up
anytime soon. even with three of
four members out of college this
summer. Members plan to try to
play in Iowa City this summer and
stay in Iowa until next year when
Rose graduates

“As long as it stays fun,’

wriﬁng skills, mistakes
In response to yet another [letter to the
editor] of literary genius published last
week—this oneconccmingstudentreac-
lion to the football ﬁlms seen at Titular
Headi I'djust like to say. “Wow, what
a piece of sh-l," Sure, the authors made
some good points (and I agree with the
majority of their arguimeiit). but the Way
tl'leymade them made my brain him. One
sentence really irked me. Just what the
hell were the authors tlrinkin g when they
wrote, “Webelil‘liOn-fmtbdll players had
made lhesameexact movie, it would have
never been booed and might have even
won"? Or what about the photse, “deep
ens the dividers”? Is itjust me or can you
picture junior high aueheads gossiping
about their favorite soap opera in this
manner? Is this a reﬂection of the wnung
skills at our prestigious school? God, I
hope not Surprisingly, few studentshere
write well. Have you ever noticed how
many times people conﬁne “their" and
“they're e" “your' and “you’re" (for an
ex'lmpchookal the May Sthediuonof the
cartoon Gates ofEden), or are not consis-
tent in tense? To be honest, I find ittobe
an embarrassment,

Gnnnell is touted as an academic
institution of high merit; yet, ifa random
sample ofwntingskillswas conducted on
campus, the results would be poor, I’ve
reached my breaking point. At lirst, I
