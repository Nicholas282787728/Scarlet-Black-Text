Billions mourn Mother Teresa’s death
CASTELGANDOLFO— The world mourned the death
ofMotherTeresa on September 5. Known as the “Saint
of the Gutters," Mother Teresa died of heart failure in
her religious Order's headquarters in eastern India. She
was 87.

Pope John Paul II was “deeply moved and pained” by
the death and immediately retreated to his private chapel
to pray, a Vatican spokesperson said. '

“The pope believes she is a woman who has left her
mark on the history of this century," deputy Vatican
spokesman Father Ciro Benedettini said. “She is a glow-
ing example ofhow the love ofGod can be transformed
into love of one‘s neighbor."

Indian leaders said their country and the world suf-
fered a loss With the death of Mother Teresa and praised
her committment to the poor.

“Words fail me to express my sorrow. An apostle of
peace and love, Mother Teresa is no more with us,“
Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral said in a statement.

Cuban American organization implicated
in bombings

MIAMI , A Miamirbased exile group accused by Cuba's
government of hiring a mercenary to plant bombs in
Havana hotels denied any link to the attacks Thursday,
dismissing the charges as absurd.

“Our goal has always been to oust [President Fidel]
Castro but we have done it through lawful means,"
Ninoska Perez, spokeswoman for the Cuban American
National Foundation (CANF). “This is not the type of
activity we engage in."

Cuban authorities have detained Raul Ernesto Cruz
Leon, a former Salvadoran soldier, who reportedly conv
fessed to carrying out the bomb attacks. They accused
CANF of being behind the bombing campaign.

The Cuban statement said its probe of the bombings
revealed “the preparation and execution of an operation
organized down to the last detail from the city of Miami
in the United States by a subversive structure subordi-
nated to the sorcalled Cuban American National Foun-
dation."

Perez said the allegations were “so absurd and ridicu-
lous that the Cuban government should consider updat-
ing their old KGB manuals, They read like a spy novel."

Enslaved Asian women freed from

North American prostitution ring
TORONTO - Canadian and U.S. police have smashed
an international prostitution ring that sold southeast
Asian women into bondage and forced them to work
off their debts on North America’s sex circuit.

Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the 11.8, Immi—
gration and Naturalization Service said Thursday they
conducted laternight raids on brothels in Toronto and
San Jose, California, Wednesday, arresting dozens of
poor Thai and Malaysian prostitutes and several sus-
pected ringleaders.

The raids followed similar police sweeps earlier this
summer in the Los Angeles area.

“We have disrupted a criminal organization that has
been making money from the total exploitation of young
women." RCMP Inspector Ben Soave told reporters at
a news conference.

The sex rings originated in Thailand, Malaysia and
Singapore where women aged 16 to 30 were sold into
slavery for upward of318,000 and smuggled into North
America through Vancouver.

The human cargo then entered a revolving world of
brothels, massage parlors and escort agencies, where the
women provided sexual services to pay off their “immi~
gration debts." ~

Police ofﬁcials said the size of the prostitution ring,
estimated at between $1.4 million to $2.2 million a year
in Canada alone, was staggering.

“When you consider what the syndicates pay for the
girl and what they get for each girl, they’re making a
tremendous amount of money," said Matt Siuda, senior
special agent with the INS in Buffalo. New York which
helped coordinate the llrmonth investigation.

Assault leads to security concerns
Administration introduces

Developments in sexual

assault case made public tighter security measures

BY PHOEBE SILAG
Staff Writer

On April 30, 1997, a Grinnell College
woman reported she had been sexually
assaulted in her dorm room,

Many students left campus With issues
still unresolved.

This opened the college community’s
eyes to challenges such as poor commu-
nication between administration and stu-
dents, and weak on-campus security.

This past summer, more information
has become available. Criminal charges
were ﬁled against Senni Kamara ‘97 for
the alleged sexual assault that occurred
on Grinnell College campus April 30. A
warrant was issued June 11 for his arrest.
According to Sergeant Randy Hanssen.
Kamara will be “expedited back to the
area where the charges were ﬁled“ if he
is caught. The FBI is assisting the police
department in the search. “We haven‘t
pinpointed his exact location," Sgt.
Hanssen said,

Karnara faces charges of sexual abuse
in the second degree, a class “B" felony.
If convicted, he could face up to 25 years
in prison, with bond set at $25,000,

“People have to understand that this is
not aTV show," Sgt. Hanssen said. “You
don‘t solve a case in an hour. Investiga-
tions are conducted very thoroughly.
Every option and piece of information is
followed up on. We comply with all
criminal laws; we collect physical evir
dence and statements."

The Sexual Assault Working Group,
now in its third year, handles issues re
lated to sexual assault. “Initidlly we
talked about policy and developed a bro-
chure with information about options that
a student has if the student is sexually
assaulted," Associate Dean of Student
Affairs, Jennifer Krohn said. “We are now
more involved in educational, positive

programming, We also look at policy,
how it is implemented, and how it's
working."

Jan Llnquist, the viecrpresident of
Planned Parenthood ofWestcrn Michi-
gan, will be Visiting Grinnell Tuesday.
September 16. She will meet With fac»
ulty and students all day, and then host

Several new security measures and
changes in Grinnell's policy regarding
campus security will occur this semes-
ter Many ofthe changes are planned in
response to concerns raised after last
semester’s sexual assault.

“From my standpoint, it was a diffir
cult situation," Jennifer Krohn, Associe

cus on the aspects of sexuality and
sexual decision making," Krohn said.

In addition, SGA is holding an open
forum Monday to discuss campus see
curity issues, Sgt. Hanssen and VlCE‘
President and Dean for SludentAffalrs
Tom Crady will discuss the new secu»
rity measures and close with an infor-
mal question and answer period. The
forum will be held at 7:30 pm, in the
South Lounge.

ate Dean ofStudentAffairs, said. “Some
of the things we had to do, we had to do
because of educational privacy rights
legislation. We tried to do the best we
could."

“We had numerous discussions with
students last spring, both in open forums
and individually," Krohn said. “What we
found out was that you could get into
dorms with a ﬁngernail ﬁle. We imme-
diately changed those cores, and the

cores in the outside doors were changed
again this fall."

Due to concerns about the locks, elec-
tronic locks will be installed during Fall
Break. The locks will use cards rather
than keys, which will enable the college
to deactivate a card if it is lost, as op-
posed to replacing the whole system,
which is necessary with standard locks
and keys, Until then. no keys for the
current locks will be given to non-stu-
dents.

According to Director of Housing
Steve Larson, off-campus college~owrled
(OCCO) houses will also have electronic
locks, possibly right after the new looks
are installed in residence halls. The tim-
ing depends on whether everything “runs
smoothly right away," Larson said. If
not, locks will be installed in OCCO
houses later in the year, at the same time
as installations of electronic locks in the
academic buildings.

The red and black plastic key covers
that were available to students at the be-
ginning of the semester are a safety pre-
caution while keys are still necessary.
The covers help to alleviate the contu-
sion and shorten the time it takes to look
at three similar keys when trying to open
the door ofa residence hall.

In order to ensure security on campus,
the administration is creating a security
ofﬁce. “We need someone who is more
specialized in'dealing with security and
crime so that we can do ourjob better."
Krohn said.

Whether the administration will also
institute a security patrol is still unde-
cided. “It's a little too early to see what
we will do about that," Larson said. “It
will have a lot to do with student input."

Currently, the Grinnell police depan-
merit patrols the campus as part of the

Campus religious organizations fill void

BY LAUREN WOLFE
Staff Writer

Hallways and bulletin boards across
campus are littered with photocopied fli-
ers: Zen Workshop advertisements.
Baha‘i statements of beliefs, Christian
pizza party invitations. Many attribute this
to the efforts of Chaplain Deanna Shorb.

Last year Shorb founded the Chaplain’s
Interfaith Association (CIA), a
multireligious discussion group devoted
to promoting interfaith understanding and
cooperation,

“Opportunity to engage in religious
dialogue from a variety ofreligions should
be part of what we offer in a liberal arts
education," said Shorb.

"Students shouldn’t come here and feel
a void if there’s something we can con-
nect them with," Shorb explained. “It's

really critical for the students to be able
to find a faith community, I wouldn‘t
want anyone to slip through the cracks if
he or she were looking."

In an attempt to broaden the diversity
ofreligion on campus, Shorb and the ad-
ministration worked hard over the sum-
mer at getting information out to firstyear
students about all the many religious
groups on campus.

Postcards asking new students about
religious interests were sent out, and the
responses were collected by the Ofﬁce
of the Chaplain, From these, Shorb was
able to put together information for each
student depending on their expressed in-
terests and then compile a mailing list for
each organization.

Group leaders themselves were more
motivated than usual this year, which is

apparent in the number of ﬂiers all over
campus “I was just feeling really moti-
vated,” said Collis Rost,‘98, one of the

leaders of the Baha'i Association.

Rachel Weiss ‘98, president of
Chalutzim, the Jewish organization on
campus, believes the higher visibility of
religious groups is conducive to Grinnell‘s
tradition oftolerance. ”The Open and vis-
ible presence [of religious organizations]
on campus contributes to the diversity
here, There are optidns for everybody."

Vylar Barkauskas ‘98, leader of the
Pagan discussion circle, described these
CIA discussions as “both painful and en-
lightcning. They bring out some conﬂict,
but also diversity."

Rost applied this idea it to the world at
large, describing “a need for a global vi-
sion of unity}:

“I don‘ t see any distinction between
religious groups on campus, ’explained
Rost. “Every group is trying to follow
divine instruction. They're doing some
thing for the good of humanity in the
name of religion. This is a great thing."

Weiss proposed another theory on the
increase of religious awareness on cams

' pus. “People go in waves," she said.

According to Weiss, activities at Grin-
nell, notjust religious activities, tend to
move in cycles. “Some years are very ac-
tive years, some are transitional, some
are apathetic.” This year she believes the
incoming class is a very active class and
eager to get involved.

“It’s not that the Class of 2001 is in»
herently more religious," she said. This
just may be a more active year, if there is
a cycle at work.

CompUSA brings technology and controvers

BY DAVID NATHAN
StaffWriter

This year for the ﬁrst time, students
with computers can connect directly to
campus networks through the ethernet.
With the advent ofthis new systeln, how-
ever, has come conﬂict. Students have
complained that the cost of services and
equipment offered by CompUSA, the
campus afﬁliated computer company, are
two high. On the other hand. Grinnell
College Computer Services (GCCS) is
pleased with the new system,

“Overall, I think we‘re satisfied,” said
David Dale, Associate Director of Com-
puting. “The thing we‘re really happy
about is having the upgrade facility here
on campus." In addition to sales, the
CompUSA center (located in theYMCA)
offers certain upgrade services and repair
work once a week. The center saves stu~
dents the costly drive to and from Des
Moines (or even home) to repair comput-
ers. But that convenience has a price as
well.

“They‘re charging too much," said

Chris Moseng ‘00. “Basically, they’re
abusing their connection to their school
to take advantage ofthe people who don’t
know about computers." Moseng works
as aUserConsultanl (UC) on campus and
has started an upgrade service ofhis own
on the side. “I help people with Compute
ers all the time As soon as I saw how
CompUSA was working, I got started."
Hailing from the Twm Cities area,
Moseng has worked with computers all
his life. lfyou have an cthemet card and
twenty ﬁve dollars, he'll install it for you.
Ifyou need a card and the service, he can
provide both for fifty. These rates are
considerably lower than those offered by
CompUSA, which charges $49.97 per
hour (or fraction thereof) to work on a
computer plus the cost ol‘tlie connection
card, which can range from ﬁfty to well
into the hundreds of dollars per card.
CompUSA was selected by Grinnell’s
Residential Computing Committee,
(RCC), a group made up ofstudents, fac-
ulty and technical staff, after reviewing
several interested parties. These parties,
