Opinion:
890113 In Perspective

BY BRENDAN FLAHERTY

I should have dropped the class on
the ﬁrst day, the moment she said.
"I‘his is not an intramural sport.“ I
wanted an intramural sport. I wanted
to get into somethingv—learn it, ap-
preciate it and improve at it—not for
the sake of winning or even compet-
ing butjust to have a good time with
good people.

Ithought of Introduction to Stngcs
craft, with its relatively nonacademic
technical topics, as a four credit up
proximation for an intramural sport.
I told myself how great it would be
to take it easy for a semester, learn a
little about tools and, at the end of
the semester, sip a few beers with
some of the infamous “theater
people."

Needless to say, I was delusional.
Yet, when Professor Pip Gordon
pointed out I was not in for an intra»
mural sport, she was only halflight.
With the end of the semester loom-
ing, I have come to the realization that
theater is virtually a sport and that
there is nothing intramural about it.

The comparison dawned on me
opening night of the dance perfor-
mance. After a week of intense re-
hearsals it came time to perform. I
was the S.B.O.’(Sound Board Opera»
tor or, in layman’s terms, the guy who
presses “play"). From the ﬁrst re-
hearsal, I felt like the weak link. I
did not know how to "takeia cue.” I
did not know backstage etiquette or
anything about the equipment, but I
struggled and eventually got my act
together. Fifteen minutes before
opening I was hit with a feeling I
hadn‘t felt since high school. It was
the queasy, jumpy feeling that rose
from my depths about ﬁfteen minutes
before my then all important high
school hockey games.

Above Roberts Theater in the
sound booth, Ibegan getting psyched
up the only way I know how. I be—
gan hitting my chest,jumping up an
down and telling myself “you‘re the
man" and to “come on, come on."
The primordial machismo of the pre-
game warm-up completed, I felt the
nervous, jumpy feeling reach a cre~

,scendo and.then transform into the

‘ calm, cool and collected feeling ofa

money player. If I was Jeff Clement,
I would have been breaking records.

The performance went off per-
fectly. At one point, however, 1 al—
most mixed up a volume level but,
with quick thinking and quick hands.
averted the disaster. After what
amounted to saving the show in my
idealistic mind, I was overcome by

‘ the same feeling I got after I came up

with a stellar save on the ice (I was a
goalie). I felt gratiﬁed and self-as-
sured but also relieved that I was able
to afﬁrm the trust my teammates gave
me.

Because in the theater, as in
hockey (a phrase I never thought I’d
hear), every individual must put ab-
solute faith in the capability of every
other individual. a unique bond is
formed among teammates/stages
hands. The bond is reinforced by the
feeling of shared sacriﬁce, Everyone
on my hockey team got up at 5:00
am for morning practice, put count»
less hours into conditioning and re-
lentlessly honed individual skills.
Everyone working the dance perfor-
mance sacriﬁced grades and more by
putting in about 40 hours of work the
week before the production.

With so much time and energy in»
vested, participants in both theater
and competitive sports must be de~
voted and disciplined. As a junior
history major, l was neither when I
encountered Professor Gordon. In
the spirit of my high school hockey
coaches, she accosted me in front of
the class for coming to lab late. “If
you were working for me, I‘d ﬁre
your ass,“ she said. A little harsh?
Maybe, Necessary? Absolutely.
Professor Gordon, like any good
coach, fosters the team community
and motivates individuals to give
their best effort to the team.

However brief and academically
unsuccessful my theater experience
has been. it has rekindled my appre-
ciation for sports and given the a pro
found respect for both Grinnell's ath—
letes and theater people. It is now
clear to me why athletes and theater
people are sometimes described as
exclusionary groups. They are ex-
clusionary to the extent that the eXr
traordinary things they do and feel
demand extraordinary sacriﬁces.

The Grinnell College men‘s ten»
nis team will head into this
weekend’s Midwest Conference
tournament with plenty of momen-
tum. The Pioneers finished their
regular season last week with victo»
ries against Cornell and Illinois Col-
lege.

Competing without Aaron
Wagner and Michael Chang,
Grinnell eked out a 4-3 win against
Cornell. Spenser Piston at No. 1.
Seth Pourciau at No. 2 and- Nate
Solmose at No. 3 all won their
singles matches. Matching Piston
with Pete Dekock, Pourciau with
Solmose, and Nate Knoernschild
with Collin Conoley, the Pioneers
swept the doubles matches.

The netmen played more consis-
tently sound tennis in their 7-0 win
againstIllinoisCollege. “We played
pretty well last week," said Coach
Andy Hamilton. “I especially
thought everyone was solid against
Illinois College."

Piston, Pourciau, Chang, Wagner,
Solmose and Dekock convincingly
defeated each of their opponents.
The Piston/Dekoch, Pourciau/
Solmose, and Chang/Wagner
doubles teams were likewise victo-
rious.

Hamilton specifically praised
Wagner’s dominant 6-2, 6-3 win.
“Aaron Wagner‘s defeat of the Illi-
nois College No. 4 player was the
highlight of our trip,“ Hamilton said.

”This is avery young team so my
expectations are not too high for this
weekend. However, ifeveryone can

. get hot, we have a chance to win the

MWC title. I’m very pleased with
our results this season. Our dual
record of 13-6 shows we’re a good
team, but this week will tell us how
good we are," concluded Hamilton.

In the second contest Grinnell
bowed, 67]. Laurel Steinmetz
scored the only run for the Pioneers.
Pitcher Sarah Banola gave up four
hits in the loss. The split with
Monmouth meant that Grinnell
needed to win at least one game in
Saturday's doubleheader against
Lake Forest to host conference.

The first game was closely
fought. After jumping ahead by
three in the ﬁrst two innings, the Pio~
neers quickly found themselves
down by two as Lake Forest rallied
in the fourth inning. A pitching
change and solid batting brought
Grinnell back into the game. Livi
Lenihan knocked in Erin Doyle and
Vicki Drake followed with 2) RBI
single to tie the score in the ﬁfth.
After a scoreless sixth inning, the
Pioneers jumped ahead by two and
held the lead, 75 to secure the south
division title.

In the second game Jan Maxwell
scored on a Lake Forest error in the
ﬁrst to put the Pioneers ahead to stay,
10. Grinnell maintained their lead
behind the four-hit pitching of Sa-
rah Banola and ﬂawless defense.

The Pioneers dropped a non-con-
ference pair to Iowa Wesleyan last
Tuesday, 4-2, 90.

This year’s softball squad has set the record for mast wins
ever, most double plays and tied the record for home runs.

men’s golf team hopes to continue
their improvement. The linksmen

and Illittois College. Friday the three
teams will play at Illinois College
and Saturday they compete at Knox
before coming to Grinnell.

”This tournament is always im—
portant to us," noted Coach Greg
Wallace. “Knox is typically the best
team in the Midwest Conference and
1C. is usually solid. If we can stay
close to those two teams, we‘ll have
an indication of how we'll fare in the
league tournament next week."

The Pioneers host the MWC
championship Friday and Saturday.
May 8-9, at the Grinnell Country
Club and Oakland Acres.

Claire tied for second at 610. The
Pioneers shotalWosday total of714.

Sophomore Raj Sahu may be hit-
ting his stride as the season
progresses. After shooting an 81 the
ﬁrst day he ﬁred a second-round 72.
That score was the best mark by any
golfer on Saturday.

“We know Raj is very talented just
by his performance last season, place
ing third in the conference," eXr

Skalland totaled 190,

“Our goal is to shoot in the 3405.
Saturday we had a chance but we
couldn’t conte up with good scores
to complement Raj’s outstanding
round. Our rookies are capable of
perfon‘ning better," said Wallace.

“We are really excited about these
next two wceks because we get to
play at home. Hopefully some fa-
miliar surrotlndings will help us
bring our scores down," he con-
cludcd.

Baseball team loses two
heartbreakers

BY SETH KLEIMAN
Sports Information _

According to Coach Tim
Hollibaugh, “finishing" seems to be
the primary concern for the Grinnell
College baseball team this season.
The squad struggled to ﬁnish last
weekend as it dropped three of its
four games to conference foe Illinois
College.

The Pioneers split a doubleheader
Saturday, losing the front end, 3~l.
before coming back strong for a 971
victory. Sunday the diamondmen
could not muster the ﬁnishing touch
and fell, [0-9, and l4-13, in two ch
tremely close match-ups.

“It is very disappointing to come
away with only one victory after pro-
ducing so many positives against an
excellent team." remarked
Hollibaugh. “We performed well,
but we are young and ﬁnishing our
games is what we need to work on."

In the ﬁrst contest Saturday the

Pioneers managed only one run and
gave up a threesrun fourth inning to
the Blue Boys. In the second game.
however. the Pioneers exploded for
nine runs. Jacob Chavez led the
charge both offensively alld defen-
sively by belting a grand slam in the
sixth inning and throwing a blister-
ing 12 strikeouts in six innings.
Michael Munoz posted the save in
the ﬁnal inning.

“I can’t say enough about our
pitching pcrfnnnnnce in this game,"
commented Hollibaugh. “Chavez
was outstanding and he now has 44
strikeouts on the season. Great alls
around play was exhibited by every
one."

Sunday the Pioneers lrzlilctl early
but were ignited by anothcr grand
slam. this time by Justin Lea. A
three-run cushion was produced and
the outcome appeared probable. I.C.
slowly worked its way back after live

Pioneer errors and eventually stole a
one—run lead in the final inning to
secure the victory.

In the second game the
diamondmen excelled at the plate,
but were daulitcd by runners left on
base. Brad Ruhoff connected for
three singles and adouhle, Lea lnan~
aged two singles and a double and
JP. Chnstiansen slugged twosingies
to solidly outhit the Blue Boys. The
Pioneers took an impressive 13.10
lead into the ninth inning. but then
gave up four runs to fall in another
disheartening loss.

“We left a total of 13 men on base
antl it clearly came back to haunt us,"
Hollibnugh stated. “Our conference
hopes have faded, but we still have
to concentrate on improvement and
positivity as the season comes to a
close. We are young and ittakes time
to learn how to finish each and eve
cry game W1ll’l authority."
