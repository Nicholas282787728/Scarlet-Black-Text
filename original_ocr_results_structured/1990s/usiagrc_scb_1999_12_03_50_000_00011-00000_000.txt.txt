Dear bdiror,
Whendecidingabourdivesringcnnnell'sholdingsiiiccc

good. Many orus would like ro rhink rhar we could simply
yank our supporr and send pollurers air unignorablc message.
However, rliis is nor rhe case For one simple mason: rhey d.
ready have our money IfGrinncll College owns any srock in
rliese companies, ir already pur up a non—refundable invesr—

ing rlicse invesrrnenrs. we would only be doing rhese cnmpar
nies a bivor, sinee Grinncll would no longer be able ro colleci
irs dividends. since rl-lc eorporarions already have rhe money
from rlieir srock issue, hasrily selling rhese sroeks would nor
cause rhem any harm eirher. ir would only cause rhe college ro
lose money. Alrhough a large scale dumping ora company's
srock may admiriedlyger resulrs, is ir really possible for Grinnells
holdings ro signiﬁcanrly aireer rlic huge corpomrions which are
rhe rargers oidivesrmciir? By divesring orsrnck in rhese corn.
panics, we would also lose any inﬂuence rhar we have over rheir
enviroiimenrad and business pracrices, since corporarions are
ulrimarely responsible ro rheir srockholders. Divcsring orbonds
and orlier hnancial assers would creare similar problems for rhe
college and would be iiisr as incrrecrive a means orproresr
Much orourscholarship and rinancial aid comes from rhe

OPINION 11

By Andrew Civelllni

The rime or die year has come (or our eyelids ro become droopy, our deep ro be deprived, and our inrellecrs ro be
pushed ro new regions. Ai leasr rhar's whar ir docs for me. When i signed on ro come ro Grinnell in rhe spring of‘97,
i did iior anrieipare rhis srare, being challenged back rhen meanr regurgirarion ormenial iacrs and characrerisrics, as
well as rhe all-[oo-oﬁcn “repear rhis commonly and simply performed experiment or assignmenr so I don't have re
reach aiiyrhing new.” Was I ever naivel so now, having been rhrough a handful orsernesrers in rhe Grinnell environ»
menr, and having eneounrercd nlinosr no professor rhar asked me ro regurgirare wirhour serious conremplaiion, i am
rired bur happy. (Nor rhae you care iri am happy.) The cnvironmenr here for learning in every sense orrhc word is
grear, bur ir could ger berrcr,

How could ir ger better? I have no clue ar die momenr, bur i am herring rhar some oiyou do, and rhis is why i am
going in use my space rhis week ro argue For campus aerivism. I don’t mean rhc rype oracriyism rhar involves proresrs
or marches, alrhough I have a high degree or reopecr ior rhose who srand srrong and proud in ehe public eye for rheir
issues,

No, whar i mean is lirrle rhings, Sirring ar a meal in Quad (nor ro alienarc Cowles diners), I overheard ren people
in my vicinicy ralking abour issues and problems wirh rhis campus rhar could he changed. ir would be beneﬁcial. i
suppose, irl could lisr all orrhesc so rliar rlierc would be a public record, bur I'm afraid my memory isn’r char grear.
Regardless oirhar, rhings can change. we have on rhis campus a represenrarive sysrem rhar runcrions under democraric
principles, one where any srudenr's concerns and issues can be raised, It's called ioinr Board and is meees every Wednes.
day ar 7:30 p.m. in rhe Forum, and every John and sarah can arrcnd (nor ro menrion all rhc orher srudcnrs),

Voring is anorhcr way for you re be an acrivisr. (Oh. acrivisrs everywhere iusr eringed because I used rheir much-
loved one ro describe people who simply vorc. Deal wirh ir; it’s as much a sraremcnr as eoyromg else.) So he nor
chaining yourselrro Mcnards. lsig deall lr is a righr you can cxcmse where you can rake a srand, and a dehnirivc one ar
rhar. so if you have an opinion (I haye yer ro meer a crinncllian wirhour an opinion), rhen vore in campus.widc
elecrions (nor ro menrion local. srare, federal). i have yer, in few years working wirh polirieians ar home in Pittsburgh,
ro and one who does nor rear your vore. Yes, rear. see, when Mayor Jane Doe knows halioryou won’r yore rhen she can
do wharever she wanrs wirhour pissing offrhc voring half. And I don} care who you are. polirics in poweshiek counry,
Des Moines, and Washingron arrecr your daily hie. Ereryday, no doubr, Voring ro raise your VICWS brings ir all closer ro
you.

The idea oryoring as a polirieal srarernenr in and orirsclr is one rhar i champion. Regardless orhow you vore, rhc
acrion irselrsays rhar you buy inro rhe premise oirhe elecrion, you are willing ro aecepr rhe resulrs, and char you respeer
ihc enrircryorilic process Nor voring is a srarcrnenr ro rho opposire errecr, even irir is our onaeincss. By nor voring, an
eligible vorer shows rhar rhe sysrern is nor valid in rlreir eyes and can nor represenr rhem.

Think aboiir ir .. iryou don'r saywhar you wanr, will you gcr ir,>

Bui whar abour ilie disillusioned souls? Whar abour rhose who feel no candidares represenr rheniz To rhe problems
posed by rhese ouesrions l argue rhar you can always yore rora errtHn Ifyou can't rhink oranyonewho besr represenrs
your views (yourself, maybe), maybe your views aren'r rhar developed and you don’t know whar you wanr. That’s a
personal problem. To be voting age wirliour having oplnlons is, in iriy narrow experience wirh voring age persons,
impossib Exprcssing rliose views by conrrihuring rn rhe public senrirnenr is viral ro any socieey, bur only by voring
(where cirnens can yore) can rhose views be represenred in rhe halls orgovernnienr Make no mistake; iirhe 140
million Americans rhar did nor vore in 1998 decided ro vore in 2000, rlic expanse or our polirical discourse would
change. and many more ideas would be considered. Nor voring iiisr perperuares rhe currenr srare orelire poliricr, which
in my opinion is limired and qualiﬁed, so iryoii pay ro play rhc game (remember rhe ﬁrst rimc rlrey rook taxes rrom
you), don'r chicken our when ii's your aim ro play,

Siderracks are fun. My overarching poini here is rlrar when opporeunieies ro add your opinion ro rhe public scnri-
rnenr are orrercd ro you on a golden rick-er (or a whire ballor slip), rlicn grab rhcm, You may nor have rhar righr come
ncxr elecriori oryoii don'r cxcrcisu ir (exrrenie, bur wliar irir happened?) Thar's iusr my opinion, rake ir or leave ir.

One iinal nore as we enrei rliis Hell week. alrhougli many people rook issue rvirh rhc “Srop rhe Madness" cam—
paign, rlie reasons pur rnrrli by rhc aiirlror in a loner ro rhe ediror lasr week were praiseworrhy,‘ro say rhe leasr. To
assrirne anyone is ignoranr based on a posirion rhey rake, acrion rhey perform, or parh in 1ti rhey choose, is ludicrous
i applaud rhe srareinenr. “Doii'r assume iliur because I am nor on your side I inucr be ignoranr " Yeah, Ler's all rake
THAT lioirie wirh us roday.
