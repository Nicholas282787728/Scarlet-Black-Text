With the release of its upcoming
album, A Tribe Called Qutsl, one of
hip hop’s most respected groups, is
calling it quits. Entitled The LOH!
M01!!m!i£l,[l‘l€ album is the fifthTtibe
record in rhe pnsr decade. It will be
released on September 29.

Rumors of the group’s breakup
were hrsr heard months ago. These
rumors grew as the group oonrinued
to skirr rhe question during inrerviews,
and wars further bolstered when Tribe
rapper QaTip released a white label al.
bum under a pseudonym. Finally,
while on rour with the Beastie Boys,
A Tribe Called Quest ofﬁcially anr
nounced that The Lat/e Mruemmr
would be the their last album. The
breakup marks the end of one ofthe
most respected rap groups in the mu-
sie industry

The Love Mouemm promises to
be an exciting album, As the name
indieares, love is rhe predominant
{heme or the record. The first single
offthe album will be “FindAWay,” a
songabour relarionships. OLl'ier tracks
include “Against the World" and
“steppin’ ir Up," with guesr appear»
ances by Busta Rhymes and Redman.
The record also includes remixes of
many ofTi-ibe's famous songs, giving
the album an added “Best Of” flavor,

Since its inception, A Tribe Called
Quest has been pushing a style ofrap
based on posiriviry. During the lare
‘80s, most rappers wore gold chains
and tried to acr "hard." In a timcwhen
it was cool to be angry, rhe Tribe was
one of the first groups who weren‘t
afraid to smile. They, along wim fel-
low New York City rap groups De La
soul and rhe iungle Brorhers, formed
a collective known as the Native
Tongues. The Native Tongues pro-
mored a style ofhiphop rhar was fun,
pro-black, and (perhaps most impor-
tantly) positive.

By rhe curly ‘90s A Tribe called

sound in rap, Mixing inrelhgenr lyrics
with jazzy beats, rho Tribe led the way
for such groups as rhe Pliatcydc and

roo White No matter. The Tribe jusr
kepr doing what rhey wanred. How
many rappers with QsTip’s repurarion
would risk doing a rap on Dee—Lite's
song ”Groove is in the Heart”? Other
Tribe collaborations ineludewotk with
ianer Jackson, Nas, and the doors, in

counterparts, from the hardcore old
sehoolers to rhe West Coasr gangsra
rappers,

Much ofA Tribe Called Quest’s
success can be attributed to the unique
chemistry of_the group’s three mem-
bers. The most famous member is Q»
Tip, aka the Abstract Poetic. His su-
pet-smooth rhymes and disrincrive
“New York" aeeenr eonrrasrs perfectly
with the gritty voice ofTribe’s second
MC, Phife Dawg. The back-and-t’orth
interplay of the two rappers is one of
megroup'sbesr traits. Behind the rum-
tables is Ali Shahecd Muhammads
whose stylish and unobtrusive grooves
and jazzy breaks provide rhe perfeor
backdrop for Tip and Phife.

denrs ro reach our and rry orher areas,
and to learn about rho creative and the»

Specifically, Rice said, rhe produc-
rion raughr rhose involved more abour
“lights, sound and how ro deal with
actors and direerors." (For dealing
wirh rhe luuer, “using masking rape as
your only tool.” was Whitworth’s tre—
qucnt recourse.)

This limitation prompred the produc—

splayed around rhe circumference.
Still, rhe room will only house abour
