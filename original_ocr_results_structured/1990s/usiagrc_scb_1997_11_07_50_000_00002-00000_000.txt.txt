manitics and social sciences are more
equal or female dominated,,.There is
simply not the need to encourage
women to go into those fields be-
cause they are already there."

Booker explained further. “No-
where else are the inequities so bla-
tant. The percentages [of women] in
the humanities and social sciences
are even, and in some departments,
women make up the majority ofma-
jors, hut in the sciences, especially
math, computer science, physics, and
chemistry, the percentages hover
around, on average, 20 percent.
When women make up the majority
of the population at Grinnell, one
must stop and wonder why the per-
centages are so low.“

Physics Professor Mark
Schneider, who co-directs the New
Science Project (NSF) explained that
the low numbers of women In sci-
ence are notuniqiie to Grinnell. “This
is a national issue, and it anything,
the national trends have been dis-
couraging. There is no canned anr
swer for this."

Booker also recognized the prob—
lem as being a “reflection of the In-
equities of science as a whole, but
what I wonder," she continued, “is
why we have been content to accept
them as the status quo? Why does
such a ‘liberal' institution as Grin»
,nell turn the other cheek when it
Icomes to doing anything more than
paying lip service to creating gender
and racial equality?"

Schneider explained, “This is a
.national problem; this is not a Grin-
nell problem. If it were something
you_ could answer easily in just two
.words, then everyone would have
already solved it Some of the prob-

Science, from page 1
1cm has to do With the character of

education before students get here,"

”Some of the problem has to do
with the characteristics in the discir
plines themselves," continued
Schneider. The way physicists think
of physicists "may make it a less
wclcorning environment, particularly
for women and minorities."

“There are also things that [fates
ulty] do, I hope inadvertently, that
make it a discouraging atmosphere,
There are prejudices just in how we
live It's hard to know the origin of
these discouraging messages, Is it in
the direct Situation or in reverbera~
tions of past situations a student may
have encountered?"

“I recognize that GWIS feels em,
battled,” said Schneider.

Schneider noted that the issues
that are olconccrn to GWIS are also
of concern to NSF, in particular the
issue of the lack of women and mi-
norities in faculty positions in the
sciences, He recognized that the lack
of women and minorities as role
models can be discouraging to stu»
dents.

“There are some reasons that are
valid why it is difficult to change
that," said Schneider, “and some rea
sons that are less valid...It‘s challeng-
ing to get faculty, especially faculty
of color, in the sciences, so it der
mands extraordinary efforts,

“We may need to face that. What's
a reasonable way to fix this? You
don‘t want to hire anyone just be»
cause of the way they look. This
would not do anyone a service."

Other issues, such as the retention
of female science majors, have seen
more success through the reform ef-
forts of NSF. The number of minor-

ity students majoring in the sciences
has seen significant increases "in the
ball park of a doubling in the past
four years or so," said Schneider. The
numberof'female physrcs majorshas
also increased.

“It’s difficult to know how much
of that is due to NSF," continued
Schneider. “I would say somE; I
would be foolish to say all of it No
body involved in NSP feels like
we've fixed all the problems, but
everybody feels that we’re making
some significant contributions."

“There is not a lot of direct dlar
logtle between GWIS and NSF," said
Schneider. “but there is not anything
intentional in that. It might be a use-
ful connection to explore in the fu-
ture "

Grinnell Women in Science was
founded four years ago by the same
organization that first began the Sat-
urday Science Program, which
brings 5th and 6th grade girls from
Grinnell to the college to participate
in science activities and hopefully
generate in these girls an interest in
the sciences. This organization “saw
the need not only to address the is-
sue ofyoung women being tumed off
from science," explained GWIS or-
ganizer Melissa Booker, “but also the
issue of why many Grinnell women
are turned off by the sciences,"

Since that time, the role ofGWIS
as an organization has evolved some-
what. “For a while, Saturday Science
was the primary focus of GWIS,"
said Booker, “but in the last two
years GWIS has taken on the role of
becoming a support network for
women in scienceand battling issues
of gender inequity on the Grinnell
College campus."
