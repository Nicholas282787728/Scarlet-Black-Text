WoodyAllen's Fictional
Purple Rose of Cairo

By Brett Fechheimer

Cecilia (Mia Farrow) has a few
problems. Not only is she livtng in
New Jersey at the height of the
Great Depression. but she also has
to put up with her husband Monk
(Danny Aiello), an unemployed
bear ofa man who sometimes uses
violence against her.

lt'sno wonder,then,lhalCecllia
finds it comforting to make fre-
quent trips to the local movie thear
ter, the Jewel. to see the latest pic
ture. She is especially fond of a
frivolous little film called The
Purple Rose of Cairo. And one
magical day a character from this
movie, Torn Baxter (Jeff Daniels),
stops his scene, looks straight at
Cecilia and steps out of the movte

and into her life.

That is the basic premise of
Woody Allen’s delightful was
film The Purple Rate of Calm.
As Tom and Cecilia spend more
and more time together. the com-
plexity of the plot increases: the
other actors in Tom's film can’t
go on without him. for example.
and the film’s tlircCtor is sum-
moned.

ThePttrpte Rose of Cairo is
wonderful because, in a typically
Allenesque way, it affirms the
viewer’s faith in the power of
cinema. It is also deliciously
funny. An example of this film‘s
sense of humor occurs when
Cecilia describes Tom to her sis-
ter: “Ijustmet a wonderful man.
He's fictional, but you can't have
everything."

Suzanne Vega '8 Bland
Days of Open Hand

By Jennifer Manes

Suzanne Vega: latest summer
release Days of Open Hand has its
gleaming moments. On the whole,
though, it is a departure from the
emotional resonance of her earlier
work. Vega’s first two efforts
explored with aching clarity the
spatial and psychological isolation
of stark urban life in Manhattan.

Doyr of Open Hond is more
oblique and less visceral. And al-
though Vega’s lyrics and imagery
are at times effective, her undiffer-
entiated musical backgrounds don't
offer them adequate support. They
are flat. lifeless. aural pastiches
deﬂated of any drive or emotion.
Sedentary and vaguely commer-
cial, the CD could be piped in at
some unprecedented and unhoped
for “New Age" madrigal feast
during the holidays.

One song features a Mediterrav
man—sounding fluteand handclaps.
Another groans with a sonomus
chamber organ and at one point
erupts strangely into an almost
tropical beat. Almost all of the
songs sound exactly alike, though.
They invariably [eanire discordant
strumming, echoing aural patterns
and weird synthesized effects

However, Days of Open Hand
does feature two songs that manage
to break away from the dull mono-
tone of die others. In “Tired of
Sleeping," a character is prompted
to action by a weird assomnent of
surrealist images surrounding her.
Kids with money loll mysteriously
in the din of churchyard steps. A
man rips off the lining of hisjaeket
tn inadvenently reveal a “close
quilted heart." Body and clothes,
appearances and reality, are thus
disturbingly. synthetically inter-
woven.

“Institutuion Green" is an ef-
fective rendering of isolation
among the patients at some un-
specified institutional waiting
room, “Prtvate people in this
public place" yearn for a human-
ized recognition ol'sell. 'l‘hesteady
tapping of a percussion instrue
menratids a scuttering base from
which the song’s liquid aural ate
mosphere departs. It is eerie and
manua-like,insectlegsand claws
clicking incessantly to their own
alien beat, and it is fitting accome
paniment to Vega’s existentialist
waiting room.

However. lyrical and musical
content rarely {use on the CD to
this haunting extent. Its high
lights are worthwhilebut too few.
Days of Open Hand is the product
of a tired and uninspired artist;
perhaps Vega’s next effort will be
more enlivening.

Yuri Bashmet has been lll'llVel'r

collaborated with many of the lead
ing conductors and orchestras, in

living musicians."
