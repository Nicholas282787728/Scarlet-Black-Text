“The basic story is about a woman
who was released froln prison on
three years probation [after being
cleared ofcharges for murdering her
liusbandl,” Edgell Said. “The story
IS about how she puts her life to-
gether and how she fights for her
children against her former benefacr
tor,"

As in her previous works, the my
tersection of characters from a varir
cty of ethnic and cultural hackr
grounds is central to Edgell's depicr
tion of the rich Belizean populus.

Appnrcnr in Edgell's reading of
The Fer/ival amel Joaquin, her pror
tagonist, Luz Marina, demonstrates
the quality ofEdgell’s fiction which
makes it both universal and intensely
personal.

“The source of the idea came from
a newspaper clipping," Edgell noted.
“I didn't know the people at all. but
the story stayed with me. I decided
to try to write it from her point of
Vtew."

Thus Combining reality with her
own imagination. Edgell crafts the
intricate thought process ofa woman
who tries to survive the emotional
and physical turmoil of domestic
abuse. prison, and rejection by her
family and community. The Festival
nfSan Joaquin is scheduled to be in
stores by the end of this month.

Women’s issues and empower
inent are also a priority for Edgell
outslde of her fiction. She now is
director of the Bureau of Women's
Affairs in Belize. She has done work
for numerous women’s groups and
activist groups including CARE,
UNICEF. and the Peace Corps.

William Makgoba teaches short bio course
South-African professor also lends political perspective

BY KEVIN MCGoLDRICK
Staff Writer

Professor William Makgoba ofthe Unir
versity of Witwatersrand, SouihAfi-ica, will
serve as guest teacher and lecturer at Grin~
nell durilig the next two weeks. Makgoba.
who teaches molecular immunology, also
wtll provide instghl about the South Atri-
can political and social cllinatc. His visit is
sponsored by the Rosenﬁeld Program and
the biology department.

After studying to become a doctor,
Makgoba chose to spccmlize in molecular
immunology to fulfill his personal interest
in human diseases. Makgoba’s l'athci' suf—
fers from diabetes. Tl s personal connec-
tion fueled Makgoba 5 interest iii the field.
he said.

At Gnlinell he is teaching a coulsc in his
speClalty which will give 25 students it “birds
eye view of the principles of immune re-
sponses in humans " The course will provide
a framework for students to understand die
connection between the body's immune sys—
tem and human diseases. Charles Cowles '98
voiced enihusiasin that the biology dcpanmcnt
is offering the shon course

“I’ve always wanted to know more
about immunology." Cowles said.

Makgoha spoke to Grinnellians this

week about his role as apolitical activist in
South Africa as well as his work in thc Stir
cntiﬁc laboratory.

“Politics is the number one piobleni, it's
Just the way life is. It's important to be a
role model. but you can't play it locked up
in n laboratoiy," Makgoba explained. “You
have to relate [coming to the SUCH] prOr
ccsses you are working under."

Inspired by his bclicfiii dlscussnlg both
scientiﬁc and social issues. Makgoba said
he hoped to act as an injection of reality
from which students on campus will henr
cl'it. Makgoba lectured this week on edur
cation and political democracy in South
Attica as well as leading a medical discus-
sion on the critical role of adhesion mol-
ecules ill TCell Recognition,

Makgoba grew up in a rural northern
province in South Africa where he was a
shepherd between the ages of five and 15.
The “absence ofprlvllegc, continuous sub
jugation of blacks" and the pcicepiion that
blacks naturally had a “lack ot‘achicvement
aiid a lack of ambition." were accepted
when he was growing up and those attir
tudes still are present to a large degree,
Makgoha said. While the country no longer
has apartheid poliCIes, he said, the wllitc
minority still controls much of the eco-
nomic base and ctitploymcnl opportunities

He said that South Africa employs “afﬁrr
mative action," but that it is designed to
create “ablack middle class that will be able
to protect them (white South Africans) "
“In the U.S. you would refer to [blacks
hired under the pretext of such protection}
as Uncle Toms," Makgoba said. A power
struggle has developed in South Africa and
has diseased all pans ofthe country, he said.
Makgoba'spcrsonalexperience With this
powerstru lccame when 13 faculty mcmr
bcrs at Witwatersrand sought to oust him
from his appointment as the Deputy Vicer
ChancellorofAcadcniicAl'fairs, citing that
his ”credentials were not in order."
Makgoba said the incident resulted in a
“blatantly racist" campaign to disciodil him.
which sparked national attention, People
pried into his academic records and created
false infonnation. The faculty members
presented their ﬁndings to the media with
out consulting Makgoba. According to
Makgoha, whites had reason to fear his
Africanlst ideologies because they were
challenging the institutional power struc
ture of Witwatersrand Like other actiwsts
in South Africa, the Al‘rlcanist ideology
Makgohn promoted was interwoven with
a campaign to transfomi the nation's insti-
tutions to better reprcscnt South African
culture. Makgcba said he believes that the

African educational institutions should
move away from the European institutions
on which they traditionally been based and
begin to emphasize and incorporate a feel-
ing of “Africanness.” The attempt to oust
Makgoba forced him to relinquish his adr
ministratlve duties. However, he said he
remains an ad liuml'neni professor of mo
lecular immunology in Witwatersrand:
School of Pathology.

Despite his activity in South African
politics, Makgoba said he is ﬁrst and tore-
most dedicated to his scientiﬁc work..
Makgoba has visited the United States
more than a dozen times, including doing
postrdoctoral work at the National Insti-
tute ofHealth in Bethesda, Md. from 1986
to 1988.

Kimberly King ‘87 said she met
Makgoba in South Africa while working
on her dissertation research abroad and
proceeded to relnain in contact with hlm.
King invited Makgoba to visit Grinnell.
She said she hoped Makgoba could help
the campus community in the “examina-
tion ofgovemance and racial inclusion in
South Africa."

“This issue is pertinent to the U.S. as
we continually struggle with sharing
power with those previously excluded or
disadvantaged by the system," King said.
