Characters Tangle
in Last Tango

By Jennifer Mattes

In the midst of his Native
American human rights efforts
in the 70‘s, during the Wounded
Knee trial, a tired Marlon
Brando was sitting at a restau-
rant table in South Dakota when
a female tourist presented him
with a stick of butter and asked
him to reenact a particular scene
from Last Tango in Paris.

“Please, lady," the actor
responded wearily.

It could have been worse,
At the time. Brando was
embroiled in political affairs in
which he held strong personal
interest, and such an incident
could Very Well have provoked
the actor‘s notorious temper.
The incident, however, was still
embanassing.

Brando had made noncom-
mittal remarks concerning his
1972 collaboration with Italian
director Bernardo Bertolucci,
saying he didn't understand tart
Tango in Paris, and had even
found it unintentionally hilar-
ious upon a second viewing.
He also claimed he had “faked"
his performance, that the
emotional rigors of genuine
method acting were too taxing
for him anymore. Brando's
sincerity is highly dubious as
always. and, in any casc,_you
can‘t tell by his performance.

Brando brilliantly plays
Paul, an expatriate American
living in Paris who is trying to
deal with the recent suicide of
his wife, While apartment
hunting he encounters Jeanne, a

young actress, and within the
first twenty minutes of the film
they have a ton-id, anonymous,
sexual encounter. Paul rents the
apartment and they continue
their affair, so the ﬁlm is full of
such scenes.

The relationship becomes
increasingly perverse and
paradoxical. Paul insists that
they remain nameless to each
other, independent of what he
perceives to be their everyday
identities, He is casting about
after his wife’s death. trying to
find some meaning to life, and
the apartment he rents becomes
a haven in which he can
cathartically experiment with a
relationship,

The ﬁlm is stylistically and
thematically complex. almost to
a confusing degree. Bertolueci
employs innovative camera
angles, jump cuts and paral»
lelism to underscore the
complexity of the characters and
their situation. For example.
Jeanne‘s boyfriend is a director
who films her and himself in
artificial, screenwritten relation-
ships. They rely on mundane
sentiment. Her relationship
with Paul, on the other hand, is
somehow more genuine. It
doesn’t rely on artifice.

Yet Bertolucci, as the
director, does. Last Tango in
Paris is a distinctly European,
arl»house film, the kind with
contrived camera angles and
symbolic mirrors. It is
paradoxical, just like the
relationship it portrays, and like
Brando himself.

Kiss of the Spider Woman a
Misunderstood Masterpiece

By Mark Bates

I once saw Manuel Puig, the
author of the novel Kiss of the
Spider Woman, become
uncharacteristically angry when
asked about the ﬁlm version of
his famous novel. The
normally soft spoken Puig fired
a hated reply to the seemingly
innocent question. I‘ll never
forget his response: “Let me
say that I don’t care to talk
about that ﬁlm. It was in no
way related to my novel. I
don’t want to answer any more
questions about it!“ Puig then
took a deep sigh of relief. and to
my surprise, paused a moment

to calm down before calling for '

the next question from his
audience.

That was in 1986, just
shortly after the film's release.
Now in 1990, I continue to
believe that Puig was greatly
mistaken about the film, its
artistic value, and its relation to
his novel. Kiss of the Spider
Woman, directed by Brazilian
director Milton Goncalvcs, stars
William Hurt in his Academy
Award winning role as an
imprisoned homosexual, Luis,
torn between his need to be free
and his growing love for his
cell-mate, Valentin.

Kiss of the Spider Woman is
one of those rare films which
deal with homosexuality
honestly without resorting to
the sort of sappy melodrama
present in such films as Making
Love or A Certain Summer.
These films normally portray
gay/lesbian characters who
disrupt an otherwise happy

scenario with the issue of their
sexuality, then disappear when
the conﬂict is resolved. Such
simplistic plot treatments would
not be found in Kiss of the
Spidar Woman.

William Hurt's character
struggles for sanity amid the
absurdity of prison life in Latin
America by retelling a movie, a
pro-Nazi propaganda film, to
his political prisoner ccllmate.
played by Raul Julia. The
resulting conflict of political
purpose, espoused by Julia's
character, and escapist aestetic
used for survival by Hurt’s
character becomes the
foundation of the rest of the
film. Hurt's character must
decide whether to betray his
cellmate in order to earn his
release from prison, When he is
finally released he again must
decide whether to fulfill or
betray his doomed friend‘s
request. Kirr of the the Spider
Woman is full of tension that
travels beyond the sexual
orientation conﬂict, and avoids
the mundane solutions that
films of similar content often
present.» Even as the reality of
the film that Luis is narrating
and the relationship between the
two men begin to correspond
and intertwine‘,‘iv‘e are left in
suspense as to how this very
complicated plot will finally
unravel.

I wish that Puig would give
this film a second viewing. The
excellent roles played by both
Hurt and Julia, as well as the
versatility shown by Brazilian

actress Sonia Braga as she plays
a multitude of distinct characters
make this film an absolute
pleasure to watch. Perhaps he
could see incorporated into the
film the same sensitivity and
care that he demonstrated in the
writing of his marvelous novel,

Night Shift
Keaton and

Winkler and
deadly dealings

A pre-Batman
Michael Keaton and post-Fonzie
Henry Winkler are the stars of
1982's Night Shift, 3 so-so
comedy about a morgue worker
who gets caught up in some
shady dealings There are some
funny lines and interesting ,
performances from the actors,
which includes Shelly (Cheers)
Long cast as a prostitute, but
the movie itself is not high
comedy. Night Shift, however,
does provide fine entenainment
for a cold winter evening when
there is nothing better to do.

Considered by many
to be among the best of the
Marx brothers‘ movies, Duck

incompetent man becomes pres-

then declares war on another
land. The movie contains some
classic Marx brothers’ se-

lemonade stall and mirror
sequences. If you are a fan of
