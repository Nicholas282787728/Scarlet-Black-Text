An Open Letter from the Newspaper Staff

Theslaff of the ScarlemndBIuck
feel that we are not getting the cone
sideration and support we deserve
for the time and effort we put into
producing a weekly paper.

After much deliberation,wede-
cided to emphasize our point by
creating a four—page issue that
represented what the Scarlet and
Black could be without the full
coverage we suive to maintain.

Because we realized that such a
bold move would provoke ques—
tioning and controversy, we felt
obligated to clarifyour motives and
justify to our readers that we have a
legitimate cause to be angry.

We believe that every newspa-
per has a right and an obligation to
print the news honestly, It is also
the right and duty of a paper to
bring to light issues which may
otherwise go unnoticed. We are a
fonim fordiscussion anda medium
for entenainment.

To achieve these ideals, every
journalist suffers long hours. Yet
we dedicate ourselves every week
to producing a quality newspaper
becausewe enjoy the satisfaction of
Creating a tangible product and the
experience we gain in doing so.

However, when the negatives
greatly outweigh the positives. we
have both a right and a need to
voice our concerns to our reader-
ship, in order that our problems
may be addressed.

Last week every page editor
spent more than 30 hours to pro
duce last Friday's issue. In addi»
tion to the regular staff meetings.

this time included interviews and
writing as well as editing and lay
ing out the pages. Beginning at 9
am. on Thursday morning. mem~
bers of the staff worked conunur
ously until 5 am. Friday morning.

We are obviously not doing this
for pay: our respective salaries are
below those of the SGA cabinet
members, By averaging the salar
nes over the number of hours ex-
pended toward theScarlel undBlack
during a semester, one finds that
editors make less than 50 cents per
hour. Not exactly minimum Wage.

We believe that maintaining a
qualilynewspapershould notcome
at the expense ofoureduczttion and

health, We have had to work late
nightsbeforeearly morning classes
and exams. This is not conducwe
togood academics. By letting such
conditions continue, we would in-
evitably have to choose between
the quality of the newspaper and
maintaining our academics and
health. This is no choice at all.
These long hours can be bestcut
down with better equipment. Cur-
rently the outdated or malfunction
ing equipment we are forced to use
slows us down unnecessarily. Pages
that are almost complete have been
ruined by a mechanical breakdown
and have taken hours to finish.
Also, since we paslerup pagesat

the Grinnell Herald»Regisler, we
lose time traveling between it and
our campus ofﬁce. A production
location on campus would ease this
strain. lt wotud also ease our fears
of assault. Walking repeatedly to
and from town after tntdnightis not
exactly safe. Several times, staff
members have waited until dawn to
walk back to campus, compromis-
ing lack of sleep tor safety.

Long hours are compounded by
the fact that we must advertise for
writers every week tn the Campus
Memo and our own pages There
are enough students on this campus
interested in journalism and public
relations as potential careers to pro

vide this newspaper with a capable
writing corps. However, some,
times, a writerwho does commit to
writing an article will wait until the
day it is due to inform us that he or
shecannotcompletetheassignment
due to time constraints. At that
point, it becomes the editors' re-
Sponsibility to finish it.

”these are not frivolous com
plaints. Nor is this only a recent
Situation. We have suffered these
conditions for too long.

Considering that much of the
effort we put in is unseen, and that
many do not realize how a newspa-
per operates, we can understand
some of the lack of consideration
the Scarlet and Black has received
from its readers in the past. We
would like to change that

For instance, while we do not
expect special treatment from our
professors,wewouldlikefromthem
consideration similar tothat shown
to members of spons teams who
must sometimes miss classes or
exams forexnacurrieularactiviues.

Other readers also misunderr
stand the editorial decisonmaking
that governs a paper. In order to
maintain our integrity, we cannot
compromise our obligation to re
port the news by catering to the
whims of readers. We are not here
to pacify readers, but to tell the
truth. We also reserve the right to
cut long articles or letters for space
and clarity, or not to print them at
all. In enter to maintain objective
