At the Grinnell

it was a dark and stormy night.
But we had a mission that even a
raging blizzard couldn’t deter. ‘Twas
a journey of many snow flurries that
ended in an empty theater in Iowa
City. To set the mood for the ”chick
flick“ we were about to see, we com-
menced to run, topless, down the
aisle We should’ve felt empowered
and in touch with our femininity.
Instead, we just ielt stupid.

is about Finn (played by Winona
Ryder), a graduate student torn be
tween a beau-hunk bearing straw—
berries and her fiance, an all-around
average guy With a penchant for car—
pentry, Finn “escapes" irom her iian.

plete her mastet’s thesis, which ex.
amines handicrafts and their effect
on tribal Culturesi At the same time,
the quilting bee, an object of her
study, influences her former percept
tions of the institute of marriage.
The group’s present project, a wed.
ding quilt for Firm, is an amalgam—
ation of symbols representing past
and present loves of members of the
quilting bee. Composed of Finn’s
relatives and their friends, the bee
presents marriage and iniideiity with
a do<as—lrsay—not—as—l—do attitude.

This film, presumably intended
to promote a feeling of female bond—
ing, sueeeeded only in bemgasemo—

tionally unfulfilling as running top—
less down the aisle, Considering the
Subject of the film and the tearierk
quotaofthisgenre offilm, the poten»
tial for sappiness is great. Thankful«

proves thor old people are cool too).
The stellar performances by seasoned
professionals such as Maya Angelou
also enhance the movie.

Although thestoriesofthe indi«
vidual women worked into the film
well,wefeltthatthewgnetteslacked
any real resolutions due to the time
constraints of the movie, which was
already two hours long. This aside,
the cinematography, acting perforr
mances, and verbal interaction of
the characters made the moVie well
worth the treacherous drive to the
theater.

ﬁlm review

John Huston won academy
awards for the screenplay and direo
tion ofthis moi/ie, ivhich many crit»
ics believe is one of the best Ameth
can films ever made. The movie tells
an ironic story of three men who
hope to strike it rich in the Sierra
Madre mountains. Humphrey Bog—
art gives a great performance as Fred
c. Dobbs, whose depravity, paranoia
and selfishness complicate the search.
Walter Huston. John Huston’s fa-
ther and wmner of an oscar, plays a
toothless, shrewd old prospector. The
film is distinguished by fine charac-
ter studies and excellent photogm»
phy.

James Agee of Time Magazine
said of the film, “One of the best
things Hollywood has done since it
learned to talk. Walter Huston’s per—
formance is his best job in a lifetime
of good acting. Humphrey Bogart
does the best work of his career."
Critic Pauline Kael said “One ofthe
strongest of all American moVies."

do is watch is wife cut hair, have sex,

don’t know what to write about this
iilm. It wasn‘t bad, it was too loving

was just the story oia man who only

You know, 1 think anytime guys go on

you eat pork and beans constantly.
Yeah pork and beans, with serious

like a man. We also had several talks
on the virtues oi masculinity. Then
that got horing so we went and saw
