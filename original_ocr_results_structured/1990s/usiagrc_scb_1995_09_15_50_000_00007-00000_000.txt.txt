bathrooms at Burling are part of a list that includes the Zirkle‘ Gates-Kawson Tower. ARH, and Mac Field. With that in
mind l find it surprising that the bathrooms have received as little attention as they have. In general, we seem to take
the uniqueness of our bathrooms for granted. All in all, the bathroom graffiti consists of four main types The categories
are: lists, quotes, oomrnen ts on issues, and artwork The topics of discussion and the general ambiance of the bath
rooms varies a great deal depending on which particular bathroom you happen to be in. Anyone who has frequented Burling
has undoubtedly noticed the differences between the graffiti found in the single sex/bathrooms in the basement and the
coed bathrooms on 5rd and 4th floor As a Circulation desk worker, I first noticed the difference in graffitr along gender
lines as a freshman. Every night before closing the library we check the bathrooms for stragglers before leaVing. I
remember the first time I had to check the women’s bathrooms. Damn l thought to myself, this is really different from
the men's restrooms. 50 With me as your witness, 1 can assure you that the difference between the men's and women's

restrooms is like comparing night to day

my Molecular Genetics class." but I decided to wait until
the first test to decrde whether a miracle is really
necessary Other items which l found really interesting
was a piece Called Kurt Cobain's private hell and a number
of pomted soornful remarks made by the black pen person

Fourth floor l5 where you go lf you want to get lrlto
some serious stuff, Personally, I found the discussions
here to be kind of scary ln general‘ there seems to be a
lot of talk on morality and religion If you're wondering
whether God eXists, this is the place to go There seems
to be a lot of verbal bashing going on between Christians
and atheists. and honestly both sides are a little scary
in the Judgmental and narrowrniinded nature of their
statements One woman made the followmg comment,
“Well, the bathroom on the 4th floor is really annoying me
All this talk about whether God is a he orshe or it lthirr
those people should ask Sylwa." There is also a pretty
heated discussion of abortion on fourth along With a list
of the best lists on campus

BY AND CHECK THEM OUT, OK LEAVE SOME MES-
SAGES OF YOUR OWN. DON'T LET THE FACT THAT
IT’S VANDALISM STOl7 YOU. l’M SURE FAClLlTlES
MANAGEMENT LOVES THE GRAFFIT AS MUCH AS
WE DO YEAH RIGHT. WHO AM I KIDDlNG?

AS much as I hate to admit lt, the graffiti in the men‘s
restroom :s generally crude and derogatory. ln general,
the graffiti doesn't paint a very complimentary picture
of masculinity if you ask me 1 found the walls to be
plastered With insults and crude sexual innuendo. The
graffiti contained few if any encouraging or positive
commen ts. lnf l didn’t find anything even remotely
positive With t. e xception of someone who had writ—
ten, “Vii/rd Rocks ”

Mixed in With the insults was a ton of homopho—
bie graffiti Actually, homophobic i5 an unders tate»
ment; the graffiti JUBC plain oas hed gay men There was
so much of it in fact that 1 really doubt whether high
school students were the sole contributors. Along
with the antirgay messages there was a ‘ot of discus
sion on the morality of homosexuality, Like the other
bathrooms there were quite 2 few lzsts However. 1
found the topics to be rather shallow Guys, there's
only so many times you can list the bestrlooking women
on campus before it gets old. The men's restroom also
contained a heated discussion of whether the adl’l’llSr

members of the football team. As 3
Biology mayor. l was quick to notice
that someone had scribbled “Hardy—
Weinberg Sucks,” surrounded by as» '
sorted p and g values.
