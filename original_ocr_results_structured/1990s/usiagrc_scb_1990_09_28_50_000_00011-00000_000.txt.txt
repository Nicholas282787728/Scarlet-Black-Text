National—Caliber Les Duke Invitational

By Katherine Fairbanks

On a course sporting rollercoasr
Let-style hills and high winds. plus
a pack of 130 runners all vying for
a place in the race, the Grinnell
women’s cross country team fared
well. This course was none other
than the Oakland Acres golf course,
ingeniously transformed by men’s
coach Will Freeman into the ideal
test of pain and endurance: Les
Duke 1990.

The meet, a preview to the Divi-
sion Ill national chamionships
which willalso beathkland Acres
in November, attracted a large field
of teams, including die nationally
ranked squads of Carleton,Simpson
and St. Olaf. Even with the stiff
competition, the Skullcrushers
managed to finish tenth out of 18
teams.

for the Pioneers came at No. 3

haps the toughest for the lady Pio-
neers considering the team had to
battle severe winds as well as their
opponents. Grinnell seemed to
thrive in the bad conditons, easily
winningallninesinglcsanddoubles

Especially impressive were No. 2
doubles, Jenny Wangrludy Chun,
and No. 3 doubles, Stephanie
