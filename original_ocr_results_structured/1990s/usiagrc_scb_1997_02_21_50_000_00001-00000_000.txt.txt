RISE group forms

BY PHOEBE SiLAG
Staff Writer

A new student group is taking root this semester, adds
ing a global perspective to Grinnell’s long history of so
cial actiVisni. The group, RISE, was formed to create an
international political conciousness on campus, accord-
ing to founding member Taimur Rahrnan ‘98. Rahman,
Jun Lee ‘98, Sonam Lama-Sherpa ‘98 and Anne Walsh
‘00 organized film screenings and discussions informally
last semester, This semester, the group plans to show docu-
mentaries and movies, hold reading and discussion groups,
contract speakers, and coordinate other events.

“The primary reason why we organized the group is be-
cause we all know Grinnell is such a ‘radical place,m Lama-
Sherpa said. “In reality, I think people are really scared of
radical thoughts, I think people need to be informed by in-
your—face movies and documentaries that they can‘tescape."

"Ihe political,ec<)nomic, and social discussions around cam~
pus tend to be very bloodless," Rahman added. “Whatwe want
to do with diis organization is put a human face to the policies
and see how they affect everyday life." According to Rahman,
the structure of RISE is based on coopemtivc leadership.

“We want to create an environment where everyone
feels comfortable," Walsh said. “Everyone can take a turn
leading, We want to give students an outlet so they feel
they can be active in politics."

‘-‘We don‘t have any hierarchy," Lama—Sherpa said. ”Who-
ever comes up with an idea will be the social coordinator for
that idea. Anyone can lead as long as they have good ideas,"

There are three levels of membership in RISE. A core
group will meet weekly and vote on proposals. A general
membership group will meet monthly to give input to group
activity. And a mailing list has been established for those
who simply want to keep updated. Students can join at any
level and move between levels. “We wanted to be sensitive
to the different levels ofcnthusiasm,” Rahman said.

“Because the group is just starting, we’re still feeling our
way through the issues,” Walsh said. “One of our goals for
the group is to connect with other groups on campus. We
want to bring together the political force on this campus."

RISE most recently sponsored a screening of The 3mi-
dit Queen ufllidia Wednesday in North Lounge. Next on
the schedule will be Roger & Me, a film about the closing
ora GM plant in Flynt, Mich. RISE meets at 2 p.m, Suns
days in South Lounge.

Mammy
of blac

BY NGOC LOI
Staff Writer

Carolyn M. West, a clinical psycholor
gist at the Family Research Center at the
University of New Hampshire, delivered
a remarkable speech Thursday on the his
torical images of black women and their
consequences in present day society. West
stressed how these images have contin-
ued to haunt our society and inﬂuence our
actions. Her speech was entitled
”Mammy, Sapphire, and Jezebel: Histori-
cal Images of Black Women and Their
Implications for Psychotherapy."

With a clear, forceful voice, scattered
at times With scathing humor, West ex-
plored three common images of black
women throughout the centuries. The ﬁrst,
that of the Mammy, originated with slae
very and portrays black women as the
asexual, big-breasted, dark-skinned do-
mestic servant who will “happily perform
her duties without any expectations of ﬁ»
nancial compensations,"

According to West, Mammy envelopes
all of humanity in her motherly warmth,
while her responsibility towards herself
and her family are trivialized. West pre—
sented the example of Aunt Jemima Pan-
cakes, a marketing ploy by a white cre»
ator who used the Mammy image to sell
the pancakes. ‘

The second image, that of Sapphire,
portrays black women with a stubborn,
sassy attitude. For example, in the sitcom
The Jeﬂersons, the maid Florence is char
acterized as discourteous and headstrong.
West said she is concerned with “how this
particular image impacts how black
women experience and deal with anger,"

The third image, that ofleubel, over-
emphasizes and degrades black women‘s
sexuality, justifying their sexual victim-
ization. For example, West said, a 19th
century British fable depicts African

, Sapphire a
k women in

women having intercourse with apes and
producing monstrous children. Black
women are also portrayed as prostitutes
in music, West cited an album entitled
Bitch Betta Have My Money with its new
single “I Wannabe Your Ho."

“[These portrayals] encourage black
women to keep a silence which I think is
not very helpful," West said.

West explored issues of skin color, hair
and weight. Although popular belief
maintains that black beauty is in vogue,
West noted that in reality the oppressive
image of black women has continued. For
example, ads today continue to promote
products intended to lighten skin and im»
ply that men like lighter skinned women.

nd Jezebel: Images
American society

Ads today also depict black hair as despi-
cable, West said, and include lines such
as “Capture his attention with TCB no-
lye hair relaxer kit." Weight is also an
issue, she noted. On one hand. women are
told that "big is beautiful." On the other
hand, ads pressure women to change their
body size to conform to societal ideals.
West maintained that the three images
of black women do not represent reality
and are destnictive, In fact, she said, many
women today have internalized these im-
ages to such an extent that they either deny
or embrace them without realizing that
each stereotype has merits and faults. For
example, the Mammy image represents
the black woman as a pillar of strength,

but at the same time deemphasizcs her
individuality and needs. West said she has
worked with patients who find it diff-
cult to abandon the Mammy role with-.
out feeling depressed than they are no
longer a pillar ofstrenglh that others can
lean on.Women must take the positive
aspects of these three images and do what
is best for themselves, she said.

“These images are not really new im-
ages. They continue to form the back-
drop of our many interactions,” West
noted. She added that she hopes once
people realize that destructive images of
black women continue to pervade soci-
ety, they will be able intervene and abol-
ish such images.

 

 

Carolyn West delivered a convocation speech Thursday at Harris Center. West spoke about
historical and modem imager of black women in U.S, society and black female identity.

Professors Adrien Wing and Joseph qusani
present on post-apartheid politics in South Africa

BY MAX JULIAN MULLER
Staff Writer

Two professors, Adrien Wing and be
seph qusani, spoke to Grinnellians dun
ing the week as part of the College's pro~
gram of events recognizing Black History
Month. Wing and qusani presented a
talk entitled “Postraparthcid Politics in
South Africa" Tuesday evening in the
South Lounge of the Forum.

Wing, a professor of law at the Uni
versity of Iowa, worked with the African
National Congress from 1991-94 as a le—
gal advisor during the drafting of the new
South African constitution. She outlined
some of the features of the new constitu-
tion and discussed how the document has
both borrowed from and avoided mistakes
ofthe U.S. constitution and constitutions
of other countries.

Many of the rights guaranteed by the
South African constitution are similar to
rights guaranteed in the US constitution,
Wing said, These include the right to free
speech, freedom ofthe press, freedom to
assemble, freedom ofreligion and others.

According to Wing. the South African
constitution also ensures the right to hous-
ing, health care and education, as well as
the right to speak, study and obtain docu-
ments in one's own language.

The constitution has a far-reaching
equality clause which states that there can
be no discrimination based on race, skin
color, disability, marital status, pregnancy,
sex, gender or sexual orientation. Wing
noted that a unique aspect of the docu-
ment acknowledges the difference be-
tween sex, which is biological, and gen-
der, which is socially constructed

According to Wing and qusani, the
new South African constitution is the only
one in the world that addresses discrimi-
nation bascd on sexual orientation. Like
the U.S., the South African constitution
has a clause that addresses “cruel and
unusual punishment," but unlike the U.S.,
it includes the death penalty in its defini-
tion of cruel and unusual. According to
Wing, the U.S. is one, of few nations in
the world that still practice the death pen—
alty.

To administer the new constitution,
South Africa has established a constitur
tional court, much like Germany did af
ter World War II, A group of individuals
selected by the new government, this es.
tablishment holds the power to decide
what is constitutional 7. a right once held
by apartheidrera judges,

Wing emphasized that South Africa‘s
new constitution is not the result of an
“ultra radical leftist progressive govem-
merit," but rather it results from years of
oppression under an apartheid system,

As part ofthe South African apartheid
govemment’s campaign to make all town—
ships ethnically pure, qusani said he was
separated from his mother at a family at a
young age, and grew up in a South Afri-
can orphanage, He was a student leader
in high school and joined the African
National Congress when it was still an
underground movement, He went to law
school and has since taught forensic media
cine and criminal and administrative law.

qusani focused on the South African
Truth and Reconciliation Commission.

The commission’s goal, he said, is to re
write the history of South Africa to relay
a more accurate account of apartheid
years, qusani noted that the commisr
sron is unpopular among many South Afr
ricans,

The cause of much of the
commission's unpopularity, qusani
said, is one of its subcommittees, the
Amnesty Committee. South Africans
who committed political crimes under
apartheid may petition the Amnesty
Committee. The committee has the
power to grant amnesty to those who
give a full disclosure of the nature of
their crimes and can prove that their
crimes were politically motivated.
qusani argued that if South Africa is
to be a nation, it must wipe the slate
clean.

“We all have blood on our hands," he
said. "The Truth and Reconciliation
Commission is not about punishing
people. Rather the goal is full disclosure
of events for an accurate record of South
African history,"

College supports PoWeshiek County schools
Steve Langerud will develop year~long program to aid local teachers

BY PHOEBE StLAG
Staff Writer

In an effort to provide College sup-
port of communities in the Powcshiek
County area, Steve Langerud, director
ofGrinnell College's Career Develop-
ment Office, will spend a year design-
ing and coordinating a new program to
aid local school teachers Thc goal of
the program will be to enhance
workforce development in the
Poweshiek County area, Langerud said.

In addition to his duties at Grinnell
College, Langerud is a consultant for
Iowa’s Consortium for Excellence In
Teaching. He will be working with
Poweshiek Area Development and
school administrators from Grinnell—
Newburg, Prairie City-Monroe, South
Tama, Montezuma, Lynnville-Sully,

BGM. HLV and Colfax-Mingo school
districts,

The new program will enable high
school teachers to “integrate new concepts
and techniques into the curriculum,"
Langerud explained. Through the Consor-
tium for Excellence In Teaching, teach-
ers will work With a professional facilita»
tor and business leaders to create dialogue
between schools and businesses. The
group will meet once a month during the
1997-98 school year,

“If teachers understand what is happens
ing in business and what people need, then
they can pass that on to students,"
Langcrud said. “We've had tremendous
success at the State level. People are re-
ally cagcr to do this. People are really
eager to talk to each other, but they've
never had a forum. That's my mission: to

create a forum."

The consortium is a cooperative effort
between Poweshiek Area Development,
school districts, area employers, and fami—
lies, .

“[This is] a way that the college can
support the community, by providing my
assistance in helping with the program,"
Langerud said. “It helps create Oppormr
nities for Grinnell College students, also.
As employers grow and develop, they cre—
ate Job opportunities for students who
might want to stay in the Grinnell area or
Iowa.”

Indeed, Scott Anderson ‘98 currently
is interning with Poweshick Area De-
velopment and is working on the Con-
sortium for Excellence In Teaching.
“What we are trying to do is to get in-
dustry trainers to teach teachers about

thc group work they do and about pro-
cesses used for restructuring industry,"
Anderson said.

According to Langerud, the new
program will encourage the develop-
ment of broad skills of the sort that
students acquire at liberal arts colleges.

“Students learn skills necessary to
be successful in work: to communi»
cate well, to read, to write, to have a
good work ethic, to be curious, and to
engage people," Langerud said. “All
the things that students learn at
Grinnell are the kinds of things that
employers want.

“We have a commitment to our
community and our state as servants,“
he noted. “This is the way we can give
and make our community grow stron-

ger.
