Pimentos For Gus blends folk, punk music perfectly

BAN coffee shops today

punkpcculiarity. Bob’s Underground,
thankfully, manages to approximate
tlus mixpretty well, even in themiddle

PimentosfarGus,aMinneapolis-

And manages to sound good at it. And

The band’s music has a sort of
quirky. innovative folk basemaintained
by two acoustic guitars. the violin, and
bass guirar(electric) that is often overlaid
with pop hooksplayod by violinistTracy
Spuehler. Fairly often, they warp mtothe
simplicity ofpunkormetalplayexlacous
tically for comic effect. This helps them
achieve a hard edge thatadds alot to the
acoustic norm.

Pimehtasfar Gus’ song selection
on Tuesday night in front of a packed
Bob‘s ranged in complexity from the
achingly sentimental to the abjectly
silly. For me, the highlight was their
coverot‘TheRephzcemertr: “Waitress

in the Sky, " (but than, I‘m a Minnesota
native with a very soft spot in my heart

for The Replacements). Other goofy
stuff included the acoustic metal
Texmtenrialirm, which included Guns
‘n’ Roses—esque screaming in the
chorus. This was the song which ended
with a very amusing attempt at simus
lating feedback on acoustic instru-
ments. Then there were "Fun and
Proﬁt, " a familiar-sounding memoir

and a whole slough of covers. includ

Pimenmr for Git: was amazing.
Some of their songs are absolutely
beautiful, including one almost fright-
ening one about counting sheep and a
number ofothers whose names I don‘t
know. The band is talented, with a
knackforfresh-soundingarrangement.
In addition, violinist Spueliler
always seems to do the right thing.

TH]! WEEK AT THE MOVIE HOUJ‘II
By ELEANOR DODSON & TAYLOR WYMAN

Staff Movie Reviewers
Eleanor’s View

PRING is a bad time for mov
S ies. It's too early for potential
Oscar contenders, and it‘s not
the big movie—going season to bring
out the hopeful hits. But there’s still
no excuse for movies like Bad Boys.
Even action movie fans will ﬁnd this

a complete waste of ﬁlm,
Everything in Bad Boys is a pale

imitation of every other action ﬂick
ever made. The basic framework

offers a reworking of the Lethal
Weapon model, with Will Smith as
the conﬁrmed loose cannon and Mar-
tin Lawrence as the married family
man. This time, we’ve got a gor-
geous babe replacing the Joe Pesei
character as the troublesome witness
along for the ride, Smith and
Lawrence offer faint glimmers of
personality, but what is supposed to
be playful banter between them is
annoying and petulant.

Bad Boy: manages to fail even
on themostsuperﬁcial oflevels. What

explosions and chase scenes are de-
stroyed by inept editing and a plot
with holes the size of Canada. The
ﬁlm seems obsessed with capturing
the high speed slickness of MTV. but
even a half hour of MTV Sports
would be more exciting, or at least
make more sense. than this. The best
thatcan be said aboutBadBoys is that
it makes you appreciate the good
action ﬁlms thatmanage to get made.

Taylor’s View

HE night was deﬁnitely over

castwhentheymadethisﬁlm.

This is the story of two Mi-
ami narcotics detectives (Miami
Vice?) who are given the job of re»
covering something like 100 million
dollars worth of heroin that was sto»
len from the Miami Police Depart-
ment. The two detectives can‘t seem
to stop arguing with each other but
manage to work together to recover

the heroin and kill the evil European
mastermind (Die Ham). This ﬁlm
is ﬁlled with borrowed scenes: at
shoot-out in a black and white tiled
bathroom with someone sliding
across the water drenched ﬂoor for a
gun (True Lies .7), a policeman on
foot chasing the criminals as they
race away in a car and catching them
(Lethal Weapon .7). It also contains a
completely senseless plot structure.
Without any rational reason, the de.
tectives must switch identiﬁes so that
a key witness to a minder doesn’t
ﬁnd out. and the internal affairs
department shuts down the Miami
Narcotics Division because they lost
the heroin (the Miami Narcotics Di-
vision? Does that make any sense at
all?).

Another really sour point about
this ﬁlm is the fact that everyone, not
only the two detectives, bickered and
whirled all the time. It got to the point
that I just wanted to yell at the screen
“Shut up and do your job!" I saw on
the newslastrtighuhatthisﬁlmbrought
in 37 million dollars its ﬁrst weekend;
I think it would be interesting to come
pare it with its second weekend totals.
OK enough dealing with this distaste
ful subject. Better wait till next week
to go toartlm. Bottom Line: BadBoys
wasBorrowed.Bickering.andBizarre.
