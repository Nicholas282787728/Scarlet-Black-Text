Grinnell’s English Department should
expand out of dead, white men’s literature

ON’T get me wrong, I'm not
trying to bring up the
multicultural debate in this

newspaper again, butl was just thinking
about it recently, and I think that the
English department here should expand,
more than it already has, out of the dead
white men literary canon.

This is not to say thatldon‘tappre
ciate the special topic classes that are
offered every once in a while or the
African- American Literature clam. I
do. But I think that there is a widely
believed stereotype that the only worth
while literature written was written by
Shakespeare, Milton or Chaucer.

I never even realized what I was
missing out on. In high school Ithinkl
read about almost every Shakespearean
playthatwas written. Itdidn't bother me
thattheonlylimmmreIread wasbydead
white men. Ididn‘t even question that I
had a year of British Lit. and American
Lit. (in which Iread only Hawthorne). It
never even crossed my mind thatI had
onlyreadoneblackauthor(AlexI-laley's

Malcolm X) or one female period (Jane
Austen) in my classes. Only last yeardid
I realize what kind of education 1 was
getting. And it pissed me off to no end.

TEQUIA’S PERSPECTIVES

 

 

 

 

 

 

By TEQUIA BURT
Iwasangrythatallofthishadbeen left out
ofmy education because whenIdid start
to read it I realized mat it had much to
char.

tamnot saying thatIthink Melville
orCenrttd shouldbeleﬂoutorreplacedin
the curriculum. tam not saying mat what

they wrote is not relevant to our lives
today. Ithinkthatlheseauthorsshouldbc
taught andI think they are an important
and essential part oiouroducation, I do
think, however, that there have been
wholeczttegories of literature thatare Just
as good and just as relevant to our lives
and human naturethathavc bccnignorcd
or unacknowledged.

Itis assumed thatonly the authors in
the literary canon are pertinent to our
lives. When there is a bookwritten by an
Aﬁican- American, Native American,
AsianrAmet-ican andsoon,itis assumed
thatpeoplewon‘tbeabletorelatetothem
because it is about their own personal
cultural experiences, That‘s full ofcrap
because the same argument could be
madeaboutShakcspcareort-tenrylarnes.
They wrote about what they knew, but
that didn’t make what they wrote exclur
sive only to white men. I would argue
that Ralph Ellison wrote about experi-
ences that are relevant to everyone in our
society. Wejustdon‘tknow thatbccause
we’ve never read him.

Studying in Lancaster, England
EFORE arriving in Blitian, I‘d
been warned by wellrwtshers
that the British were “a bit
queer, you know.” After two weeks of
imbibing British media, I concurred,
Witnessing no uproar over lesbian
couples on popular soaps or teenage-
targetteddatingprogtamsteantringgay
and lesbian people encouraged me to
believe that British society was less
reticent than I'd assumed. Lancaster
