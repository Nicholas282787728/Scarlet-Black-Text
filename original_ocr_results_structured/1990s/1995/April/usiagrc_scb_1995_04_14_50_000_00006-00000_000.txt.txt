AT wasitlike'.7 Al3: 15
pmrodayonMocField,
members of the Inter-

Varsity Christian Fellowship will
present theiranswerto thatquestion
with regard to the crucifixion of
Jesus Christ,

Good Friday, the Christian
holiday that marks the crucifix-
ion ofChrist, is today. As coor-
dinated by junior Yong Min
Hong, the re-enaetment is de-
signed to emphasrze the experi-
ence of crucifixion and the his-
torical situation surrounding the
crucifixion.

The main goal of the men-
actment will be, Hong said, to
“show that there was a man
named Jesus ofNazareth and that
he was crucified." These two
premises. which are the only two
widely accepted historical facts
about Jesus. will serve to “get

people thinking about the true
meaning of Good Friday" by
understanding “the cultural con-
textofwhatexaetlywasgoingon
duringtheCrucifixiontime,what

Crueifixion was, what it meant
tmd what it involved," he said.
Interestingly, there will be
no direct portrayal oilcsiis or of
the fabled Resurrection. Hong

believes the audience has too many
preconceptions surrounding Jesus.
Rather titan portray Jesus directly,
Hong said “we're going to try to
haveasmanypeoplcwhnsurrounded

him as posstblc: [including] Roninn
guards. the two criminals who were
crucified with Jesus, and Simon. the
guy who carried Jesus' cross when
he fell down.”
