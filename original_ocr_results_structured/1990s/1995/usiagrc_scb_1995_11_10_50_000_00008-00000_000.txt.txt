Scarlet 8: Black

Students are given too little say in important decisions

DAN BUE'I‘TNER
EDITOR-IN-CHIEF

One of Grinnell‘s hallmarks is
its self—governance policy, which al.
loivs students, for the most part. to
make their own rules about social
policies at the college. This policy is
one of the things that makes Grins
nell unique among small liberal arts
schools, and it is one of the most
positive aspects ofthe school. other
schools have cutfews; they enforce
drinking and drug laws; there are
“open door" policies regarding dat<
ing . there are myriad rules and
regulations regarding students so.
cial lives and aftereliours contluct.
Grinnell has none of these, and is a
superior educational institution for
that fact

Self/governance is one of the
reasons I came to Grinnell The idea
of being treated like an adult was
appealing, especially after years or
dealing with arbitrary rules in Amer—
ican public schools. I was excited
about coming here-Al wanted to try
my hand at being an adult. I fully
emoyed my first two years here, en~
ioyed not having rocall home ifI was
going to be out late, enjoyed being
responsible for myself.

Lately, however, asl have talked
to more and more people involved
With various groups on this campus,
and have realized more and more
what happens on this campus With'
out students’ knowledge or input, I
have become extremely frustrated
With this policy. Grinnell’s selfsgoVr
ernance policy may give its students
a great many more personal freedoms
than students at most other colleges
have, but it does not create the cam—
pus of empowered students the col—
lege would have you believe it does.

Self—governance basically gives
us, as students, the rights to come
and go as we please. to smoke our—
selvessilly,todrinkourselvestoobliv—
ion, to sleep wherever and with
whomever we choose, and to tell our
neighbors to turn their music down.
It does not extend any further than
that, it does not. despite its majestic
title, give us any controlover the way
this college is run.

Our own Student Government
Association is, basically, powerless.
The student—elected members cer—
tainlycontrolalarge amountofmon—
ey, but SGA’s realm of power con
sists ofpayingbands to play atHarris,
renting movies for Harris and the
Forum, buying soap dispensers for
the dormitory bathrooms, and hand
ing out money to various student
organizations. SGA has between
little and no influence on the way
the College is run. One of the only
ways for SGA to effect change is
through student rererendunis_
Which are proposals by individual
students who have collected a cer—
tain number of SignaturES~KlTat we
vote on in the post office every se«
mester, but they are non—binding—

they carry absolutely no weight, Once
a proposal makes it onto the referen—
dum, a I'l'mjonty ofthe campus must
approve it, not just a mayority of
those Voung Even ifthat majority is
reached. the only effect that referen—
dum has is that the Board ofTrustees
taltcs it under advisement, meaning
that they can circular file it if they
want to. So even it, hypothetically,
every single student on this campus
voted lo. say, extend the Pass/Fail
deadline, the College would not in
any way be compelled to do so

Another way that students are
supposed to be able exercise control
over the way things are run is by
evaluating protessors. supposedly,
academic departments take these
evaluations inlo account when Con»
sldetlng both contract renewals and
tenures Most professors I have spo«
ken to, however, agree that the rule,
unwritten though it may be, in both
situations is “publish or perish.”
meaning that the most important
factor by far in these decisions is how
often a professor's name appears atop
articles in scholarly yotirnals. sru.
dent evaluations should be the most
important aspecr, since we are ihc
ones paying twcntyonc thousand
dollars a year to come here, and the
quality or teaching directly atrccts
the quality arour education, but in.
steadtheacademicdepartments.arid
the college, are much more concerned
With their reputation among other
colleges,

Despite the fact that we do pay a
small tortune every year to attend
Grinnell, many ofus are still unable
to get into the courses we want to
take, and, even if we do. many of
them are disproportionately large,
With as many as 50 students in some
sections. Although Grinnell is a far
cry from, say, the University of Iowa.
where freshmanbiology is taughtover
closed<circuit television to classes
numbering as many as 600, the 5l(u<
ation is still not acceptable. If it
were. we might pay a whole lot less to
go elsewhere. The current Course
Catalog lists the faculty<student ra-
tio at 1:10, but few of us ever see
anything resembling that arterTuto.
rial, Not that classesWith fourorfive
students would always be a good
thing. but a class With 49 other stu—
dents is not exactly conducive to the
kind of critical thinking and discus-
sion Grinnell prides itselfon, And
even ifthat magic ratio of 1-10 does
show up in some uppehlevel semi-
nars, how many students are going to
become discouraged and disgusted
by the lack of attention given them
in the intro courses and never make
it to those uppenlevcl courses?

Grinnell’sadministrationseems
to have made ahabit ofkeeping us in
the dark when it comes to certain
very touchy subjects around here.
Grinnell’ssexualassaultpolicyisjust
one of those sacred cows. The col»
logs takes great pride in claiming
that its policy is fair and equitable.
and that it is receptive to, and sup»
portive of, students who file com»

thing wrong with either the bureain

administration were scampcring
around frantically, trying to unite

assault policy is not the only area of
policy at Grlnnell to be challenged
recently, and it is not the onlyexam.

its best face for the public while run-
ningaround backstage like a chicken
with its head cut off.

One of my professors once paint»
ed out to me that there is no ‘Grtnr
nell College‘ as such, that the Col—
lege is not some mythical entity out
there somewhere that makes the rules
and keeps things running smooth-
ly—it is, rather. a loosely organized
collectionofstudents.professors.and
administrators. While he may have
been correct in saying that the col—
lege is not that amorphous entity. I
don’t agree With his implied state-
ment that we all contribute to what
the college is. The administrators.
and even some members oftlia facul»
ty, seem to regard us as only students.
nothing more, they seem to think
that we’ll be gone, at least lnleIdUr
ally, in a few years, and that with us
willgoourcrazynotionsahoutchang.
lngthlngse While it may be true that
we‘ll be gone soon, we are not ‘iust
students,'and we should not be treatr
ed as such. We are intelligent adults,
and we have a right both to ltnow
what is goingon behind the scenes at
this college, and to have asay in what
is going on.

Cirilinell is truly interested in living
up to its image of a radical college
where students are involved. where
students help to change ‘the system'
