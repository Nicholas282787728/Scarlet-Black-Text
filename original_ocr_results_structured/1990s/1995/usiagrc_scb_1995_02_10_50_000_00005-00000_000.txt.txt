Students more willing
to see unknown bands

Gardner," said Jon Rose '95, head

of the Concert Committee. “And

you see the band playing, but it‘s

like ‘Wherc are the people?m

The music industry has
changed a lot since what Rose calls
“the whole Lollapalooza-MTV-al-
ternaiive thing" happened. and
that's reﬂected in the attendance
and popularity ofthe concerts that
the Concert Committee brings to
Grmnell AsRoscsaid,“Theattenr
dance a long time ago wasn‘t that
high .. The committee used to do a
survey,andiactually haveasurvey
saying ‘no more Smashing anpr
kins— type bands.‘ And now the
student body wants that, but we
can’t afford it."

It isn‘t possible any longer for
thecommitteetoduplicaiethcnow-
famous Lemonheads/Smashing
Punipki‘us/t/itcla Ttlpt'la show in
Gardner (the Pumpkins got 5300
for their Show). But there is, of
course,an upside to the alternative
explosion. Rose said that, even
though the bands playing today on
campus are still small, the concerts
over the last two years have been
better-attended because “the mn~
Jorlty still hasn’t heard a lot about
these bands. but they're more will-

ing to try them out," And, in addir
tion to the shows being generally

good, there are signs that some of
the bands that have come to Grinncll
sinccSniax/lillg PillltpkinsandSaill
Asylum may also achieve Commerr
cial success. Rose cites the we
ample of Pansy Division: “They
went on tour with Green Day and
have gotten lots otexposure, MTV
News justdidarenllylongpieceon

them."
Anotherfactorlniheinereased
attendance at campus concerts is
the committee’s effort to get away
from straight college rock all the
time and try for a more ecclectlc
mix. “We try to go offin different
directions into othergenres." The
committee’s next scheduled eon-
cert, Pancho Sanchez ’5 [min Jazz
Band, is an example of their new
effort at opeltrmlndcdness Rose
said Sanchez “is known in Lnlin
America and the Latino CommUr
nity. He’s along the same lines as
Tito Fuente, but notas well~known
in the US, And I’ve heard his live
show is a lot more lively." Fuentc
is one of the “two or three shows a
semester that we know a large part
of the campus is gonna like—like

Eleanor’s View

EGENDS Ofllle Fall is big,

I epic, and glorious; like those

early American landscapes

where the sun breaks through the

clouds over a spectacular mountain
range,

However. there is also the sense
that the ﬁlm is impressed by its own
grandeur. Melodrama is an art, per
haps a lost art. Legendr oft/la Fall
can't quite hall that perfect balance
between melodramatic and epic ad-
venture nnd comes across as slightly
ridiculous at times.

Not to say that it‘s a failure. It's
more a case of failingto fulﬁllexpec-
tations. Everything about ihisfilm is
big. Big stars. big themes, b g
cry, big acting, even big hair if you
are one of those ﬁlmrgocrs that com-

plains about a lack Ofserious themes
in today’s cinema, there's plenty to

sink your teeth into here. You’ve got
man against nature, inhumanity of
war, tortured love and brothers pitted
against each other. Expectations are
high and somehow nothing is quite
satisfied

Legends of the Fall is directed
by EdwardZwick,whohasdoiieepic
adventure well in the past in Glory.
He is aided here by a strong cast.
Brad Pitt, Aidan Quinn and Henry
Thomas are brothers, the sons of

scenr

Crazy Horse, African identity subjects of

Anthony Hopkins. Julia Orinond is
heart-wrenching as the object of af-
fection of all three brothers. And
Brad Pitt and Aidan Quinn are al-
ways worth watching (in my slightly
biased View). Yet, act as they might
with all iheirhearts, the story ends up
overpowering everyone in the film,

EGENDS Off/IE Fall is a story
of three brothers with the for

time period begins shrortly before

World WarI and runs through the era
of Prohibition.

Tristin,the middle brotherplayed
by Brad Pitt, is the mostdynamic and
interesting ofthe three and the script
rightly focuses on him, Tristin is a
person who doesn‘t live by rules that
everyone else does, and his character
is developed in a very mystical and

“Its rarely exactly the same
twice," said Bass.

Changes often make room for
the band to express feelings,

Hanley noted: “There are
definitely times when we will be
playing and someone will do
something that will just direct a
drive upward to a peak, There
are surges, There are little things
that each of us will do and it will
sort of build up."

“A lot of the best blues play.
ers and blues songs are mostly
improvised,” said Bass

The band hasn’t released any
CDs or tapes of its work yet, but
hopes to do so in the future. This
month, they are participating in
a contest sponsored by the Cenr
tral Iowa Blues Society.

Mojo Machine wtll play at

Reservoir Dogs

This film is directed by
Quentin Tarantino, the award»
winning director ofPulp Fiction.
Acoolsoundtrack, greatdialogue
and a unique nonrlinear story line
makethisﬁlm worth seeing. Most
of the film takes place in an aban-
cloned warehouse, where a group
oferiminals are hiding out after a
botched Job. Be forewarned.
though, that the ﬁlm is pretty vio-
lent (of course, next to Natural
Born Killers, it’s about as violent
as Mary Poppins),

When Harry Met Sally

Who hasn’t seen this movie?
Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan star
in this sappy, feel good love story
about the relationships between
men and women (which basically
describes most Meg Ryan mov-
ies). This is one of those films
youcan neverseetoomany times,
so we highly recommend this
movie. And take a datel

True Romance

Quentin Tarantino strikes
again in this unconventional, bi-
zarre love story. Christian Slater
and an exrhooker get involved in
a complicated drug deal that tests
the very limits ofiheir love. Exr
cellent performances and numer»
ous cameos make this an enter-
taining, if somewhat disturbing,
way to spend an evening . unless,
of course, you’re at the fabulous
100 days party! Shameless plug...
