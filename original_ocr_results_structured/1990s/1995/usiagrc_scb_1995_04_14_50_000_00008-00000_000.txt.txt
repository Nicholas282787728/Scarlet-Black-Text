LETTERS

To the Editor

KDIC explains nsion
InearlyMarch,KDICsuspended twoDls
forlheuseofprofane language onthe air.
This letter is to clarify themcident and the
actions of KDIC in reponse loit.

On Friday, March 3, the host DJs
used the words “nggef' and “inch" dur-
ing their 10:00 p.m.rlomidnight radio
show “What’s That Smell?" when dis-
cussing a song they had played that con-
tained the words in the lyrics and title.
Two listeners who were offended by the
useoflhesewords called lhestationlolalk
lo the DJs about their justiﬁcation for
playingthe song. The DJs told uiecallers
and later, the KDIC staff, that the words
were not meant in any derogatory way,
but were rather in reference to the song,
