New restaurant, The Phoenix, rises
from the ashes of The Last Egyptian

By ANDY HICKEN
Staff Writer

new restaurant is coming to
town, The Phoenix Rose
taurant. which will operate

out of the home of Kama]
Hammonda. the former cook and
owner ofThe Last Egyptian, on the
corner of Fourth and Park Streets is
scheduled to open May 10.

Though his rirstousiness failed,
Hammonda said that the opening of
the Phoenix is largelydue to the help
and encouragement ofa large group
of dedicated customers who used to
patronize The Last Eygptiaii before
it wentoutof business a few months
ago.

“My customers, in many ways,
are not my customers anymore,” he
said. “They are my friends." Rising
from the ashes ofthe Last Egyptian,
the Phoenix is opening in part be
cause of the contributions of those
friends, Hammonda said.

“I lost the lease [on the Last
Egyptian]. Some of my local cus
tomers wanted me to stay, and I like
the area. So they put in the money,
and here I am," The building of the

Phoenix Restaurant is now “virtu-
ally" owned by his supporters, ace
cording to Hammonda.

Not that it looks much like a
restaurant right now. Except for the
“Phoenix" banner hanging from its
eaves, basically the restaurant looks
like the runrdown duplex it was her
fore Hammonda acquired it.
Hammonda, who is doing the who
vation “practically" by himself, said
The Phoenix will “open, hopefully,
by tho cnd of next week." Though
much of the house still looks like
This 0M House, Hammonda said he
has one room that he is putting the
finishing touches on, That is where
he is planning on seating customers,
so. “one way or another, we’ll open
hopefully by the Eighth ofMay, or
the week of the Eighth."

The Phoenix Will offer about the
same selection of food that the Last
Egyptian did, according to
Hammonda.

“Mediterranean cuisine. Fresh
rish. fresh steak, pasta and ofcourse
l’llcontinueinytraditionofvegetar-
lan dishes." Hammonda considers
himself unique, he said, in that he

attempts to serve a mix of Mediter-
raneali cuisine, whereas other rcsr
taurants usually concentrate on the
food of one country. His creations
are original. “Ninetyrninc percent
or the recipes are original. I go
outside for ideas, but I don't go out-
side for a total recipe."

Hammonda's cooking had ac-
quired an excellent reputation at
the college over the course or the
existence of the Last Egyptian,
and he estimates that more than
80 percent ofhis business comes
from the college. Hammonda
speculated that “thecollege popUr
lation is not afraid oftrying some»
thing new. They are a little more
familiar with Mediterranean food
[because] they travel a little
more."

“And. the fact of the matter is
that I’m also Willing to give people
what they want," Hammonda said.
“A lot ofpeople from the college are
interested in trying something out of
the ordinary, and that's why they
come to someone like me, who's not
trying to provide another ‘meat and
potato’ establishment."
