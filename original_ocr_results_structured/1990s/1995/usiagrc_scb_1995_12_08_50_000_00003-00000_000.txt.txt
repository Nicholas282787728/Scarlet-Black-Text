ERIN PETERSON
COLUMNIST

I always tell myselfthar it won’t
happen to me. After being assigned
fourpapers,rhreeoralpresenrations,
16 lab write—ups, 44 tests and an
originalnovel(dueFridayatSp,rn,),
I tell myself that I will state coura»
geously into the face of adversity
and. . .bravely vacuum my room

Now that finals crunch has
gained the critical mass necessary to
crushunsuspectlngcollegegeekslike
us into nuclear grit, we must protect
ourselves 7 not by preparing, of
course, but by procrastinating

While that history final may
covetbooltsyoultavenotyetbought,
there is a whole slew of informative
soap operas and talk shows on TV
from noon until well past three. And
really, when is the last time that
those CDs have been alphabetized!

Although the running season is
over, and 1 have been diagnosed
Withtwostressfractutes.shinsplints,
and bronchitis, I still tip of to the
PEG every day to run around in
circles. bike inplace, andclimbstaits
to nowhere. (Now that's progress.)
I would much rather put myself
through immense physical agony
than try to figure out my calculus
homework.

Even when 1 go to the library, 1
find myself readtng week—old oom—
ics. bathroom walls, and back issues
of Recreational] Mathematics be—
fore I settle down to find a thesis for
the. 20»page paper that isdue [Oi-nut»
row at 8,

After I find a spot to work, my
attention turns to anotherextrerne-
1y important task: making lists. A
w1se person once said: “Itsomerhing
is worth doing, it is worth crossing
offa list.” At the top ofacleansheet
of paper, I write "English, 1, Read
Mrs. Dal/011w.” I frown, scratch it
ont, and hegtn again. “English 1.
Mrs, Dallotvoy. pp. 1.10. 2 Mrs.
Dollonoy, pp, 11.20. 3. Mrs. Donn.
way 21—30.” l continue this format
until I reach the end at page 194.
Then, feeling completely over—
whelmed, [put my head in my hands.

This does not deter me for long,
however; after looking at my watch,
I realize that it has been almost 45
minutes since I checked my e—mail,
and you never know when you’re
going to get that next scintillating
message item the hall senator. (Not.
oteonrse, ll\at 1 would actually be
able to get a Burling computer to
check mail. However, it is amusing
to watch frustrated stutlents scream
in anguish: “There must be a bigger
font than Courier! What’s wrong
with threeeinch margins, anywayl")

Still, I know that I am not in as
barl shape as many otrny peers, Late
last Thursday night, as I made some
lastwninutc revisions to a pair of
papers due the next day. a woman
behind me was despairing that she
had only finished one page out or
seven forapaper due the nexrtlay, A
fellow papEPWHFEt tried to console
her by telling her that she had al-
most eight hours before it was due,
"Maybe so.” she replied, “but it's in
German."

Ah, but 1 digress This time, 1

One of the most original and
delightful comedies of the last de—
cade. Jum ltann's Tampopo auda-

swaggers into a noodle shop, owned
by the adorable Tampopo. whose

This moCk/SElious Japanese
“noodle Western" concerns Goro‘s
attempts to elevate her to the top of
the protessron, yet continually spins

off at tangents into raffish parodies
thatdeflate middle—classpretensions.
inventively erotic vignettes, charm—
ing digressions and assorted tasty
situations.

Take a break during your prep-
arations for finals week and come
see the unpretentious, capricious,
burlesque, outrageous. earthy. and
unembarrassed Tompopoithe lrnnl

with English subtitles, will be pre
sented in ARH 302 « Friday/Satur—

The arts editors and Scott Anderson would
like to apologize for the derogatory statements
about Louis Zirkle’ s sculptures in the article '
“Admire Zirkle structures in the library.”
