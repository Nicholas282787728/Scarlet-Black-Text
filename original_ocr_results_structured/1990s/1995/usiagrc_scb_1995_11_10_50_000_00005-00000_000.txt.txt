COLUMNIST

Dear Todd.
The 5&8 recently ran an ad (or

a columnist, and I couldn’t resist
looking into it. When I emailed the
paper. the editor told me to give it a
try. What’s the uotst that ooulolrap.

ofasideofinyselfivhich causes me to
loose the love of my friends, the
respect of my enemies. and any
chance ofgetting a good tecommen»
dation {or gratl solrooll

So far, I don’t really know the
staff, which allows me a guarded op—
timism. ] can place faith in my editor,
belieVing that this one W|ll be the
one for me. Remember the last two7

tlorn to use my vocabulary. This one
will he more responsible than to run
offto Seattle with a masochistic an»
alysi, I had thought that haying a
dominatrix as an editor might make
things more clearciit, but she tied up
my poetry and left it there. This one
will be different. it's a bit like dating
someone new, isn’t it?

The columns going to be entr
tleol “Letters home." 1 bet you’ve al«

ready guessed that it will be episto—
lary prose. I‘m boping to achieve at
least mildly amusing personal com-
mentary on different facets of iris at
Grinnell, including. for example,
suchtopicsasstarringanewcolumn
for me student newspapet, art. and
the lack of erotica vendors in the
Gtinnell area,

Somewhere I read that a writer
should always have an audience in
mind. 1 olonlt know it that's good
advice or not, but you‘re it for “Let—
tets home,” which makes the title
somewhat misleading except to
rliose who remember the quote
“Home is rybere, wlren you have to
gothere,theyhavetotakeyouback.”
Was it Frost who said that? I'm not
so sure about the “have to got there
part" part. but ifI were broke, bun»
gry. alone, and out on the street, l’d
hitch a ride to Michigan on the
convrctlon that you’d rate me in.
Perhaps home is where tire people
one trusts reside. Besides, “Letters
Home"fits much moreneatlyovera
column than “Letters To My Most
Trusted Friend, Who Lives In An
Unfamiliar City Far Away But Is
Nonetheless Close To My Heart."

So. We told you about my hopes
for the column. I'll let you know
how it turns out. Meanwhile. take
care of yourself, and say “hi” to av»

cuisines offered are from tlae Philip-
pines, Japan, China, Vietnam, Ko<
tea. Pakistan. Bangladesh. and Af—
ghanistan. Maria Nagan, a member
ofASlA coordinating the Food Ba—
zaar, explains the purpose for the
event as the chance to "share cul—
ltltciit's a way of making ASIA
involved with the college .. We're
not an exclusive otganization "

Tlrere is a lot of preparation
involved in coordinating tlre Food
Baaaar, as ASIA started planning it
in September, occotding to Nagan,

plains that in previous years she has
foundthe cookingenjoyable, “We all
just sat down there and talked and
rolled upfood. so iilsiuniorus. That,
and we get good foodl” Nagan says
that it is also interesting to compare
each othets' food traditions, and find
similaritiesinpreparationtechniques
in recipes from different countries,
“so it's an exchange for us. too"

This year, there will be a large
number of chicken dishes, including
Chinesechickensalad,sweetandsour
chicken, fried chicken wings, and
chicken potato curry, Some, but not

tanos, and Korean spicy cucumbets
andklmchee(spicypickledcabbage).
The Food Bazaar will run {tom 5 pm
to 7, but the food will likely have run
out before 7-00, Nagan expects. The
Bazaat will be held in the Forum cof—
feehouse (not in the North Lounge),
and students will buy tickets to pay
fot each dish. The next upcoming
ASIA—sponsored event is a talk on
November 16 by Nee la Ttevedi, who
