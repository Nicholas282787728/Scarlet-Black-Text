Virtuosity is an incredibly dark

suspense. Denzel Washington plays
a human test Subject who battles

From cigarette butts to Coke
bottles. french fries to photography,
the creators of L’Esthetique Ghetto
use just about every artistic medium
to convey images of inner city life. It
is not all just the bright lights ofthe
big city, however; it includes works
as monochromatic as a newspaper
to technicolors that would make
Disney proud.

form of the commissioned work
“Jonah: A Play" is quickly coalesc—
ing.

Written by Grinnell graduate
and New Mexico resident Rima
Miller, the play was conceived early
in 1982, though the work “didn‘t

Based on the Biblicalstory ofjonah

Crowe has great possibilities for
development as a Villain when he
orchestrates a room full of people to
death, Taking over a nightclub, he
coaxes people to give him different
screams which he then uses to record
into a song. While the scene has
great potential. Crowe’s dialogue and
confusing camera angles prevent it
from being truly powerful. Crowe‘s
character is enhanced by his SynKhete
ic form. The body has the power to
regenerate so Washington is able to
graphicallydestroyhimseveraltimes.

Bottom line: Ifyou like dark
action movies. computer graphics,or
Denzel Washington, go see Virtiios.
ity.

Aaron’s View:

Why has Denzel Washington
(Glory. Mo’ Better Blues) made so
many trashy adventure ﬂicks lately?
First there was Ricochet. the most
dull. predictable him made in yeais.
Next came The Pelican Brief, a thrill»
er almost as bad as the book (this is
saying a lot, since the book was writ«
ten byjohn Grisham). Now we have
Virtuosity.

The plot is one you could guess
(tom the previews. Washington is
Parker Barnes. a good cop iailed for
the wrong reasons (Demolition

Man?). He is let out ofjail for one
reason: to stop a computer program

gone horribly wrong. The program,
originally a simulation made to test
the police, becomes insanely power»
ful and threatens the existence of all
humankind (Wargamesi). Mayhem
ensues when a disgruntled govern—
ment programmer puts the simula—
tion in an invincible body (Termi—
natorZZ). Theprogram, SID 6.7, will
destroy all of humyn civilization if
not stopped by a lone hero (Blade
Runner? Alieris?). The rest of the
plot is recycled fromWilliam Gibson
novels, and I think anyone able to
read this is able to guess the end.
HINT: only one of the two survives.

Russell Crowe (Love in Limbo,
The Quick and the Dead) gives a
moderate performance as SID 6,7,
the wisecracking masochist. Of
course, the script Crowe is forced to
work with is terrible, and his comic
relief fails.

The one redeeming feature of
this movie is its special effects. Visu.
ally, this is a very beautiful film. We
see all sorts of colors, flying glass.
virtual reality psychedelics, etc. Ul-
timately, however, this grows as dull
as the script.

Why has Denzel Washington
started in this film? Has he grown
disillusioned With success? Does he
wish to become the next Steven See
gal or Wesley Snipes? Do yourself a
favor: stay home and rent MalcomX.
