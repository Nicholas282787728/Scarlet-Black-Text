Waltz to be week long

As the Winter months approach
bringing dreary blankets of cold and
snow, and the doldrums of another
long semester set in, the small com—
munity aicrinnell may seem an un.
bearable purgatory.

But, the annual Winter Waltz
refuses to sink into banality, as long
as the Student Government Associ—
ation can help it. The SOA Social
Committee is sponsoring a week of
social activities to precede the “Mas—
querade Waltz” which will allow all
Collegeorganizations,athletic teams,
clubs and committees to promote
their specific interesi,

Grinnell Week is as a suggestion
by Nicholas Larma ‘99, whose high
school held similar events in cone
junctionwtth“Hoineconiing". Khute
so Madubnnya ‘98, SGA Somal Co—
ordinator, has also noticed lethargic
attitudes amongst students and felt
the idea would help promote social
activity and students’ pride in the
College.

“Let‘s make [Waltz] a little more
spectacular,"Modubanyasays. “This
is going to be the very first [Grinnell
Week], and it’s a risk because we
don’t know ifpeople are going to get
interested.”

The Committee proposes deco—
rating a portion of campus holding
an open forum, inviting a speaker or
wearing representative clothing as
ways for students to promote their
groups. Each day ofthe week will be
dedicated toaspecifictype oforgani»
zation, such as individuals in com»
mon major fields ofstudy, or athletic
teams.

In addition, SGA will be offer—
ing a workshop for students to learn
to dance the waltz on Thursday.

All throughout the week, SGA
will provrde materials for students to

Walker explains that when the side
boardsstarted to deteriorate, the col
lege decided not to maintain the
rink.

To make the plaza skatable for
more thanaday,a“bladder"hasto be
put under the ice, to prevent the
melting ice from seeping back into
the ground and necessitating the reg—
ular addition of water. Puttingdown
a bladder is not cost—effective for the
college, because next year the addi—
[ion [0 the Fine Arts Building will
replace the plaza, Torn Crady. Dean
for Student Affairs, says that the col—
lege will look into creating a long—
term solution to the demand for ice—
skating. But he explains that the
likelihood of a college rink “depends

on what student interest is.”

construct masks to realize the “Mas—
querade"theme of thisWinterWaltz.

And to culminate the week, stu-
dents are invited to decorate their
halls and their dorm lounges for a
competition to be judged on creativ-
ity and student participation by mem«
bers of the administration. A mone—
tary prize will be awarded, and SGA
members hope this competition will
contribute energy and enthusiasm to
the "prevvaltz" parties in the halls.

The week of events will cone
clude with Winter Waltz at 9pm on
Saturday.
