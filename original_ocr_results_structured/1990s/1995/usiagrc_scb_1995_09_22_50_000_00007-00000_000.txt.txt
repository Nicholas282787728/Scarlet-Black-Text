Student Profile : Animal Ethics and Veganism

Bv SARAH STAVETEIG
FEATURES EDITOR

ANY vegetarians, respect ve-
ganism but don't want to limit
their food options to such few
choices. But senior Aaron

Gross. a two-year vegan. believes
that if most people fully understood
the problems created by animal
consumption, they, too would be
persuaded by veganism.

Veganism, the more extreme
version of lacto-ovo vegetarianism,
means not eating any food that
contains animal products. This
includes more than just milk. cheese,
chocolate and meat. The extent to
which Americans consume animal
products in their diet is found in
seemingly harmless foods: breads
made with eggs, soups which con-
tain beef stock, jello which has
gelatin, and many pastries, desserts,
and cookies that have butter or
margarine.

For Gross. sticking to a vegan
lifestyle means choosing to buy his
own groceries and eat at ethnic
restaurants that serve Asian. Indi-
an. or Mexican cuisine rather than
follow a board plan. “It I go to an
American restaurant. I'm in trou-
ble." reports Gross, " Being:) a vegan
makes it more difficult to eat in the
dining hall but not impossible. And
a lot of the problem is the food they
serve here is so filled with fat. But
l hear it's getting better."

And Gross believes that when
more peoplare aware of the bene-
fits of a vegan diet, there will be
more iioii‘animal options.

“My feeling is that people need
to understand just how bad animal
products are for you in terms of
health, how abusive it is to the
environment. human rights abuses
involved in the industry and make
a deci on themselves to stop eat-
ing meat," said Gross. “One of the

most powerful solutions we have is to
stop eating animal products. They're
unhealthy for us in many respects.
Their production is unethical. It‘s a
matter of understanding why these
things are troubling because it's not
immediately obvious. I see the key
thing as education."

After two summer internships
promoting the elimination of animal
use, and as the local leader ot Stu-
dents in Defense of Animals and the
Environment, Gross has begun what
he hopes is a life-long commitment to
animal welfare.

“A lot of people think that the
welfare of animals is assured be-
cause il' we treated them so badly,

”My feeling is that people
need to understand just haw
bad animal products are far
you in terms at health, how
abusive it is to the environ-
ment and make a decision to
stop eating meat.“

they wouldn‘t be healthy enough to
(consume)," said Gross. “That‘s not
true at all. You can have an animal
that is quite unhealthy but with the
use of drugs and antibiotics you can
get it to produce quite a bit. That's the
case with most of these animals."

Gross‘s most recent internship
this summer was at Farm Sanctuary.
a nonprofit animal protection agency
that shelters animals abused by the
livestock industry, educates the pub-
lic, and advocates legislature. He
worked at their California locale. one
of the states that pioneered factory
farming.

"There‘s no federal law in this
country to prohibit any practice on
animals no matter how cruel it is if it

is common in the industry." said

Gross. “As long as everyone does

it. its legal. There is no protection

against the injury of the animals.-
The laws are such that they don‘t '
prohibit anything that is common"
practice. We can‘t even begin to

rescue a small amount or even

approach the animals that we want

to help."

Specific examples of the impact
this has on animals he witnessed this
summer. as part of his internship
meant caring for the animals that
Farm Sanctuary rescued. “25% of -
all dairy cows in California 30 down
(that is, they are incapable of walk- s
ing) before they go to slaughter,“
said Gross “They become so illthat
they can't even help themselves",
He helped take care ot many ot-
these animals provide tours 0f the l.
facility, and work to educate locals
and tourists about the extent of the
problem. ‘

And the solution, according to
him, is to simply stopdepending on
animal consumption, “The best way
to deal with the abuses we see is to
digress from animal agriculture It's
an industry which has consistently
abused animals, destroyed the envi-
ronment. It has a terrible record of
human rights."

This solution sounds extreme,
even to a vegetarian, but Gross is
convinced that veganism is benefi-
cial to both anlrnals and humans.

"Most people, even it they famil-
iarize themselves with the health
issues involved in vegetarianism
would seriously consider it and prob-
ably move in that direction,“ he said.

lust what are some of the health
benefits of veganism?

"I sleep less feel more awake and
the health benefits are something; you
(an actually appreciate Veganism is
really a lifestyle“ he said
