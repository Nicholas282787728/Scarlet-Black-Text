Students upset at audience
reaction to football players’

ﬁlms duringTiuilar Head

We thought that Grinnell was an openn
minded, liberal, unbiased campus.
This is obviously not the case after the
demonstration atTitularl-Iead this past
Friday night.

Whllc the gong might have p0-
tentially been a good idea, itjust deep-
cncd the dividers between North Came
pus (athletes) and South Campus.

'the Judges, as well as the audir
once, were really unfair to the football
players. lust becatise you do not like
them docs not man that it is fair to not
even give them a chance 7 isn’t that
stereotyping and discrimination?

While football house‘s video
might have bccn it liltlc disgusting.
people yelled to gong ttcveii before it
was shown. It’cscltm'r Drunks was
really funny, but no otic would know
because no one could cvclt hear it. It
was never even given a chance be.
cause football players madc II, It was
actually a parody on Rural/(lit Dogs
but no one would even know that.

No offense to these movies, but
thcjudgcs sat and watched ricc move
around and a guy drive in a car, but a
movie with realdlalogue couldn'teven
be seenjust because ofthc actors in it.
Neither the audience nor the judges
even gave Resevoir Drunks a chance.

We are completely shocked that

Grinnell students who are supposed to
be models of open-minded liberalism
wouldact this way. it seems so incred-
ibly ridiculous. We bet tfnonrfootball
playershadmadethcsamccxactmovic.
it would have never been booed and
might have even won. The football
players that we know do not have any
bias against anyone else, so why is
there such hatred against them? This
whole thing is just so ridiculous and
we caii'tcven believe tlizttithappened.
Wc both thought that wc came
to a school that was open-minded,
but obviously \vc WCIC wrong Ncir
that one of us has ever been so frus~
trtitcd by the actions ol’studcnts on
this campus. No one was askingyou
to likc thc pcoplc, but they at least
deserved the some chance that all of
the other movies rcccivcd, Just bar
cause they are football players does
not mean that they are not students
and are not Creatlvci but thcjudgcs
and most of thc audicnce would not
even know this

All Holocaust victims
should be remembered
on Yom HaShoah Day

Last week was Yom HaShoah, Ho~
locatist Remembrance Day. This

one
‘ maintains

holiday is a memorial to all those
who died in the death camps ofNazi
Germany. Chalutzim held a simple
memorial service in the Rock Gare
den on Thursday, the 27th, I found
it incredibly beautiful and l was
moved by the chance it gave us to
remember those who had died. In
some way, I felt like remembering
those who perished served to keep
their deaths from being empty, from
being completely in vain.

Iam disturbed, however, by the
trend I see in the celebration onom
l-laShoah, and in the way the Holo-
caust IS remembered in general.
People speak nfthe six million Jews
who died, but what about the ﬁve to
SIX million others who were murr
dered alongside the Jews in death
camps? The Gypsies, the gays, lcsr
bians, Communists and others who
were executed: I would like for
them to he a part of the remember-
ing. a part of the memorial. Do we
wish the world to forget them? Do
we want their deaths to be in vain?
In the spirit onom HaShoah, in the
spirit of remembering, let us give
value to llle deaths of all lhose who
were exterminatcd in the concentra
tron camps.

A Declaration of Independence

Iliavc smoked pot (ganja, wccd, herb) for three years. Iadmit to this as

 

ficcly tisI admit to crossing the street in the face ota todliglit's prohibitive

glow. lknowthcy’icbolhIllegal,butIknowthdtthcy'rcnotwrong. For
these laws were passed to keep things niiining smoothly, and in lime,
Jtlstilicd by l’nncytntk ofsociety'scngine,which ticcdsallofits pans working
together to run at its peak pert‘omiaiice level But, to tic perfectly honest. I'm
not quite satisfied with thc way out society is running, and I have no
problem with disrupting its rhythm, and my thinking goes on, stretching
further and further, and it's to the point now where I don‘t want to play my
role anymore. Iwunl to function as an individual within a universe, not
wtthin a nation’s borders. Iain nature's creation, not man's, thusI will live
in hcrworld and I will follow her rules Survive like an animal, taking only
what I need. Be it berries, lrutts, or a sweet dcer's meat. I will spend my
days passing time and wake each morning to watch the sun rise, and peace
and love will he llkc foreign words for there will be no war and hate. My
cxistciicc annonymous, my deeds unknown, my thoughts uncharted, my
reason my owll. I know this sounds like a stoner's dream. but that should
come as no surprise, for it was while ﬂoating in the ganja airthztt I ﬁrst saw
this alternate role. And when I landed, with my mind at casc, I realized
lwas nolthc same, and to remain in this world with its reason unbounded
was something I could not do,

But dropping out is never easy, especially in the U.S. of A. For
wherever I go, and whatcvcr I do, I’ll always need things such as food.
And this requires money or a large fertile space, and even in possessing
this I lack the furmcr's Skills, Yes, I can tell you all aboutlFK, and all his
cold war deeds, but that's not going to feed me when I can’t grow a
vegetable from a seed. And money doesn't come to the man who works
for himself. lmust produce something for someone in order to get back
what it is I need. But there is notlitng I can offer that others don’t alrcztdy
have, and unlike the profitcers who formed our ways, I’m not interested
in manufacturing artiﬁcial needs. And should I manage to feed myselfand
maintain my fairly good health, society will knock again and ask for
another piece of my wealth, And I understand that the children need
schools, but what is it you will teach? And why should 1 payfor you to
corrupt what now is innocent and free, when in all their lessons you’ll
point to me, explaining that this is something you should not be? No, I
don't think I'll give you a dime, and no, I won't answer to your laws. I’ll
make my decisions on moral grounds and dismiss your politics as sounds.
You think there's a truth in compromise, but you couldn't be more wrong
7 that's as had as hearing Ace of Base and thinking it’s more thanjust a
popular song.

You can call me acriminal and Ican say the same about you, but my life
purpose is to spread the love, and that leaves no time for me to judge. So you
can have your world and keep it, I‘m moving to the woods, and you can say
whatever you want, and I’ll keep smiling and doing good. Just do me one
kind favor, it's all I askofyou —just turn offsociety’s engineforoneminuta
ofone day, and before you start it up again, ask yourself, with an open mind,
if you like it better this way.
