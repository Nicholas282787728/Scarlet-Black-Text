mcnis on campus, a new for
mat for discussion at Grinnell:

aninformal,open—endeddialogucknown
as a “Cross'l'nlk.” Sponsored by tho
Debating Union, the discussions, which
are modeled after television talk shows,
are designed to provtdc a more familiar,
less intimidating environment than the
group’s usual debates.

Wednesday’s CrossTalk. titled
“Multicultural Campus at a Crossroads:
WhereDo We Gome Hcrc'l". focused
on the general question of how to apply
multiculturalism to Grinnclt. Moderated
by sophomore Alexi Zentner, the tzilk
featured a four person panci: faculty
members Michael Bell and Victona
Brown and sophomore Zanemvula
Madlala freshman Kevin Oulds. The
discussion lasted about an hour and {if-
teen minutes, focusing mainly on the

Zentncr began the discussion by
telling the audience, “I'd like to encour-
age you to express the widest possible
spectrum or opinions in the spirit of
mutual understanding and to ask each
otherquestions. Thisshouldn'tbeatwo

ard Bright said: “In this format. the
modcmtor’sjob ts to be neutral and to
promote as many points of vrcw as pos
siblc. Hopefully. the dialogue will be

Participants in the CrossTaik did
Justthat. Aftersomcinitial hesitation,thc
talk ran itself, with much of the
moderator'sresponsibility amountingto
deciding who got the ﬂoor next. The
panel and the audience, which included
students, faculty and staff, discussed and
argued the merits of, among other pos»
siblecurricularprogmrns,oganeral‘Raoe

and Ethnic Studies,”

This was advocated by Victoria
Brown, who recommended that it be
modeled after the successful Gender and
Women’sStudies concentration Lhatshc

concentration or set of concentrations

Studies, LatinrAmencnn Studies and so
on). Participaan questioned the ﬁnan—
cial and logistical viability of the second
option at a school With only 120 faculty
members as well as the educational cf~
focuvencss of the ﬁrst option.

Bright said thatthe Debating Union
had been intending to do something like
this for scveal years. ”the intention is to
have a format that lends itself to open
discussion and debate of more compli-
catcd issues to which there are no simple
solutions." Fordiatrcason. theCrossTalks
won’t center around a resolution that is
either affirmed or rejected at the end of
the debate. There is no ﬁnal judgment

that is considered. Bright also added that
“ihcinodcl is aTV audiencetalkshow—
hopefully it won't be as cheesy as most
7 ideally, a cross between familiar and
popular talk shows and the sort that
you’d see on PBS.”
TheUnionfoelsthatthechangefrom
its mdlllonal, competitive Oxford-style
debates is necessary. Anna Grogg, De»
banng Union President, said, “I think the

traditional debate format tends to intimi-
dale people. It makes them not want to
talk This cncouragn as many people to
get involved as could be involved."

is, in fact slowly eliminating such test-
ing She claimed that Gillette is even
working toward an alliance with the
Humane Society and that no animal test-
ing was done by Gillette in 1994. A
spokeswoman for Proctor & Gamble
also stated that the company's use of
anirnalmstingwas“verylimitod...avery
last resort” and had been ”95 percent
eliminated.

The companies claim that the test
they perform are necessary because of
federal regulations regarding products
thatareconsideredtobeoverrthercounler
pharmaceutical products. According to
PETA lilemture and SDAE member
Aaron Gross, this Just isn’t the case.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Gross said that “none of these tests are
required by law” and that companies
oﬂen intentionally mislead and deceive
the public on this point.

Over 500 companics. including
Revlon,Clinique,andGM,haveswitched
to the alternative methods of testing. In
fact, these three particular companies
changed their policies after similar boyr
cotts by PETA.

PETA began contacting student
groups two mondis ago, asking for the
students' help. Recommended steps in

campus has been very receptive [to the
boycott]."

comply with this. “Students are more

back to us. However, we cannot offer
them a refund," said a spokeswoman
from Gillette.

'Ihecampusbooksttxehasalsotaken
pan in the boycott According to SDAE
member Heather Markvarz, when she
approached Cassie Anderson, Business
Manager of the store, about removing
these products, Anderson was “incred-
ibly receptive."

“We are here for the studenm and
want to support them," said Anderson.
She said there was never any doubt that

the bookstore would comply, as she
“pretty much found replacements for
everything." The fact that all products of
Gillene and Proctorand Gamble can be
replaced with similar products made by
cruelty bee companies has been a key
issue in the boycoﬂ. The only items the
bookstorehasnotremovedarePaperMate
pens and Liquid Paper.

“[Markvan] deserves all the credit.
She told us about the campus wide boy-
cott and gave us a list of all the items to
remove. We like to participale in things
the students do," said Anderson.

Although the boycott has not led to
any acu'onsfrom GilletteandProctorand

boycott will be as successful as similar
boycotts in the past.
