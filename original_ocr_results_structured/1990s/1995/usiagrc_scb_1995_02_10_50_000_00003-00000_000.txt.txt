“The creek in that film,"

ENERATION X. It’s
the title our generation
has been given. Like

the hippies and the “me" gen-
eration before us. we have cer—
tain prevailing characteristics
that describe us. Generation X
is the generation of the slacker,
the adventurer on the informa-
tion superhighway, the under
employed, the chronic come
plainer and the perpetually al-
ternative. Our cultural icons
include: Brad Pitt, Quentin
Tarintino, Steve Young and Kurt
Cobain.

What’s wrong? Did you root
for the San Diego Chargers in
the Super Bowl? Are you sick
of hearing about the informa-
tion superhighway and its evil
off-shoot: the information su-
perhighway pun? Does grunge
sound like the engine of a lawn
mower? Has Generation X
passed you over?

That’s the problem with de-
scriptions otgenerations—they
are generalizations, and generr
alizations are useful and easy to
make. Generalizations allow

 

——Current—

Dan Rather to tell Americaabout
the aspects ofcurrentyouth cul-
ture. They enable members of
Generation X to get a better un~
derstanding oftheirpeers. They
help the older generation relate
to the younger generation.

This would all be fine if
Generation X were not the ster
rcotype that it is.

Over thepast yearandahalf,
I have had one Vacation ofmore
than ten days from work or
school. I like to think of myself
as a hard worker, but I fall in to
that loosely defined age bracket
of 18 to 30. That makes me a
slacker, It doesn’t matter how
much work I do. I have no con-
trol over people’s first impres-
sion of me, especially people
who do not know me.

Allthatagenerationisispeople
living their lives under changing
conditions. The popular news me-
dia notices that some members of
the new generation do things dif-
ferently than their generation did,
and report it. Older generations
accept this as the characteristics of
the new generation. Members of
Generation X look at each other
and say, “I don’t see it."

 

 

Grill to deliver pizza, but
fried foods might vanish
from the menu next fall

By ELIZABETH MACKEY
Staff Writer

ENDING approval by
P Grinnell College‘s board

of trustees. small-scale
remodeling of the Forum Grill
before next fall may cause
changesinthemenu.Thechanges
are based partly on results of a
past student survcy calling for
pizza.

Though any remodeling of
the Grillimpactingthe menu will
depend on the board's decision,
DirectorofDiningScrviccs Dave
McConnell said that some pro-
posals for change already have
been developed, According to
McConnell. current proposals
would not call for much change
in the Forum's physical layout,

seating and lighting would ran

main the same.

“Our goal [for the Grill]."
McConnell said. “is to go with a
soup, salad, deli, bakery. gourr
met coffee concept." Coffee
would be ﬂavored, he noted, but
the Grill would not serve
cappuccino or espresso. In tact,
cappuccino and espresso ma-
chines formerly houscd at the
Grill were moved to Bob‘s Un-
derground Coffeehouse, where
they will remain due to their suc—
cess at that location.

New ovens already have been
installedintheGrlllforservingpizza
and baking bagels on-site. Pizzas
soon may be delivered to dorm
rooms, McConnel said. If funding
for the Grill remodeling passes, due
to limited space, fried food equip-
ment would be removed, According
toMcConnell,alotottheequipment
is old enough that it must be re-
placed anyway, Also, demand for
fried food is going down,

Though some Grinnelllans
may be hoping for the changes.
since all plans depend on fund-
ing, McConnell stressed that “this
thing could go nowhere,"
