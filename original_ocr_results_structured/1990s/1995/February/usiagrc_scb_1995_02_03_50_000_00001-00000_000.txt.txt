one or two students, for the sake of
maintaining kosher, will do just that.
The issue of the provision of kosher
food by Dining Services has been
brought up every few years and this
year, it has become a reality.

“We'reextremely limited in prod-
uct availability,” McConnell said, In
support of students. however, the col-
lege will begin providing 14 kosher
meals per week. Students like Balint
Nogradi have been driving to Des
Moinesthissemestertopick up kosher
food prepared by Rabbi Yassi

Iackobson. Nogradi now will be able
to get kosher meals at Grinnell. Stu-

gious or medical reasons can sign up
withDiningServlces and, within about
ten days, will be provided with two
kosher meals per day.

Kosher meals will be specially
prepackaged and reconstituted in mi-
crowaves at Quad and Cowles.
McConnell said thatasfarashe knows,
only onecompany in the UnitcdStatcs,
based in New York and distributing
through Twin Cities Poultry, provides
such kosher meals. Upon student re-
quest, the college will order Boneless

key Breast, or Spaghetti and Meat-
balls. Limited selections are available
because the meals generally are used
only on airlines for those wishing to
maintain kosher while traveling.

In order for food to be kosher,
meat and dairy products must not

mix. The utensils. cooking ware.
plates and containers for meat and

Meat and dairy products may not be
consumed together and meat must
be specially slaughtered and pre-
pared according to the Jewish Codes
of Law. Due to these requirements,
Grinnell'skitchensare notequipped
to prepare kosher food. In the past,
students have been unable to main»
tain a kosher diet at Grinnell.
Some large eastern universities
with higherdemand for kosher meals
currently accommodate their stu-
dents with kosher food. At the Uni-
versity ofMassachusetts,34 students
out of 9800 wish to maintain a ko-
sher diet and have a contract with a
local restaurant, Harvard and
Brandeis universities have kosher
kitchens, and Brown University uses
a local caterer, But most schools
similar in size to Grinnell —among

them Smith. Vassar. Oberlin. and
Colby — do not provide any kosher

W0 weeks into second see

radio station, KDICVFM, is
recovering from the initial shock of
an unexpected leadership vacuum.

Returning from winter break, KDIC

retumlng to Grinnell for his final
semester.

In an effort to clear up some
of the confusion regarding his

establish an overall structure for
the station. During the hour-long
meeting, staff members decided
they would share responsibilities
normally carried out by the star
tion manager. The decision was
based on the necessity of keep-
ing KDIC in the hands of some
one familiar with its inner work-
ings, combined with the reality
that none ofthe senior staff mem-
bers have the knowledge or the
time to effectively step into a
station manager’s role.

The leadership of KDIC is an
informal three part organization. It
will consist of program director

Grinnell‘s Kesho Scott, profes
sor of American studies and sociol-
ogy, appeared recently on the syndi-
cated televisiuntalkshow“LastCall."
A30-minutelate»nightprogram,“Last
Call" features two hosts and two guest
hosts who change nightly.

Scott was asked to do the shows
by the producer of a TBS documen-
tary, “A Century of Women," in
which she and her daughters ap-
peared. The “Last Call" edition that
she participated in was entitled “Is
there too much sex out there?" and
was taped Ian. 19 in New York City,
airing that evening.

On that show, Scott debated
with the senior editor of Penthouse
magazine; film critic Elvis Mitchell;
and formcr baseballplayer Pete Rose.
She said she felt there is too much

sex in the media, but that discussion
and action to promote responsibility
about sex is preferable to censorship
as a means of correction.

Scott explained that she was
faced with her opponents’ attitude
that sex sells and is what the Ameri-
can public wants.

“That [sex sells] may be true,"
she said, “butdoeslhatmake it right?
We need more responsibility. We
see the impact of making sex sell
when girls go out on their ﬁrst dates
and want to dress like prostitutes
because they’ye seen it in the media
and they think that’s what boys will
be attracted to. It makes it hard for
parents like myself who are trying to
teach theirchildrertthat [women are]
more than bodies or faces.“

0n the show, Scott also pointed
out that a small percentage of the
population patronizes the X-rated
movie industry, but thatmany recent

hit movies like “Free Willy" and
