several Grinnell students, as well
as Grinnell’s cross country/track
and swimming coaches at that
time, who were both leaving the

One of Coach Obcrmlller’s fa-
vorite memories was the first time in
his coaching career that the swim
team won the conference title.

“It was in 1970, and we were
still in the Old pool," he said. “It
was really a thrill to will.”

Oberiniller also remembers

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when the PEC was built, and says
it made his Job “even better."

Though they were special, the
wins and losses his teams had
weren‘t as important to
Obermiller as the relationships
he formed With students and face
ulty during his time here.

“I'llzllways rememberallthe
people I've worked with through
the years," he said.

Time to spend With his fame
ily was a major contributor to
Oberiniller's decision to retire.

“I also wanted to leave while
I still had an enthusiasm for
coaching, which made the deci-
sion harderin thatsensc,"he said.

He plans to use his extra free
time to travel more, especially to
Visit his children and grandchil-
dren, and looks forward to have

refinishing antiques, woodworkr
