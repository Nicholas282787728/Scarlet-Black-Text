Sexual assault policy challenged

KATHARINE JAGER
STAFF WRITER

Since last semester, a group of
studentshavebeenlobbyingformod—
lfications to the procedure for
filing sexual assaults, abuse, and ha«
rassment complaints. In addition,
these students would like to raise the
level ofeducation about the policies
concerning these subjects. Made up
of members of many campus organi—
zat tons, the women say that they are
“angry. aware, and knoii-ledgeable"
about sexual assault issues and how
these issues relate to the campus.

The group is now mobilizing to
make the sexual assault policy “much
more accessible," says Brooke Wil—
son ‘98. They assert that the lan—
guage of the policy found in the hand
book is extremely obtuse. They al—
lege that there are several areas with»
in the policy that could be changed
to make filing a complaint With the
college heating board more sensitive
to the rights orthose who have sur.
vived sexual assault, and for all those
involved.

Since meeting with the admin»
istration last semester, Tom Crady,
Dean of Students, states that there
have indeed been changes mode in
the wording of the policy. ”We‘ve
done a major reView,” he says, to
“clarify [the] language [of the poli—
cy.]" According to Frank Thomas,
Special Assistant to the President,
“there have been some commas adde
ed, [and] some words changed," in
order to insure that the policy is
legally clear.

The sexual assault policy found
in the the student handbook pro—
vides different information than the
pamphlet distributed this week con—
cemlng sexual assault. written by
the Office ofStudent Affairs and the
Presidential Task Force Against Sex—
ual Harassment, the pamphlet essen—
tially tells students who to contact if
they have been the victims of sexual
assault or abuse. The handbook,
however, contains further informa»

scription of the action(s) which stu—
dents can take within the qulICliil

yor the bureaucratic process entailed
in filing a report ofsexual assault. If
the procedure is followed to its con—
clusion, the case eventually ends up
before the College Hearing Board.
According to Frank Thomas, the
boatclconslstsopthteefacultymem/
bets." The Hearing Board then de<
cides the outcome of the case, and
Crady enforces their deciston.

The students are concerned
mainly with several parts ofthe pro—
cedure, their descriptions in the
handbook, and the lack of campus
education aboutthe policyand about
sexual abuse in general. Ofnote, the
policy contains “no stipulated time
period,” between the filingofacom—
plaint by a student and the action
taken by the Hearing Board, notes
Yash Kaput ’97. Cases seen by the
Hearing Board often take months to

be decided, and “claimaints need to
be assured that their cases will be
heard by a set date," Kaput says.

The group also feels that the
Hearing Board needs to be “trained
in how to deal wtth sexual assault
cases” and issues, sayslocelyn Wyatt
'99, “At present, the Hearing Board
has no training in dealing with such
issues," claims E]. Knutsen ’99.

Additionally, notes Kaput, the
activists feel that there should be an
enforced rule that professors be re—
moved from the board ifthey have a
conﬂict of interest. “At this point.
the decision is left up to the Board,"
says Kapur. The “stipulation to re—
move professors should be included
in the handbook and the pamphlet,”
she says.

The group is also pushing for
some student involvement in the ap»
pointment of professors to the Heap
ing Board. “Rightnow,” Kapurstates.
“we have no control over who sits on

that Hearing Board ”
The group also hopes to estab-

lish the use of separate Board hear—
ings for separate cases. As of now a
student who filesacomplaint ofsex«
ual assault against another student
may then find her/himself having a
counter complaint of harassment
chargedagainsther/him. “Obvious
1y, it‘s awful to survive a sexual as—
sault," says Wilson, “and it would be
much less traumatic for the surVivor
to deal WiIl’I one case at a time,"
instead of simultaneously contend
ing with both the case she or he has
filed, and that filed against her or
him.

The students also take issue with
the fact that thete is no real method
of insuring the manner in which the
assistant to the Hearing Board takes
down and presents evidence. The
assistant, due to the sensitivity of
sexual assault cases, interviews the
claimant and the respondent and
their identified witnesses, and then
presents that testimony to the Board.
Dana Bi lsky, another member of the
group. says that “there needs to be a
way to insure that the information
taken by the Hearing Board assis—
tant is accurate and complete.“

The protesters says that they
have had a considerable amount of
"difficulty" in dealing with the Ad
ministration about these issues. “it’s
been very frustrating,” Dawn The
ornpson says, because the Adminis—
tration “hasn’t been very responsive
to our requests." The group says that
there has been no “real communicae
tion” yet with the Administration,
but that they are happy to have
“some feedback," and ”are looking
forward to meeting with the Ad—
ministration in the future." “We’ve
pinpointed several things which
could be easily changed by the Col»
lege, in order to help survivors of
sexualassault,"AmeliaLobo’99says.
“We want to be a working group
which is accessible to both faculty,
staff, and other students,” says Wil—
son.

"Our ultimate goal is to change
the policy,” the group says.
