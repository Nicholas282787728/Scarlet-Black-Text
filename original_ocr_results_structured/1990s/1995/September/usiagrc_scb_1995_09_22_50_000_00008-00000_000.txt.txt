Letters to the editor...

To the campus community:

As student members ofthe Re—
sources fot Space Committee repre—
sentingSOL(Student Organization
of Latinas/Latinos), ASIA (Asian
Students in Alliance), Chalutzim
(Jewish student group), and ISO (In—
ternarional Student Organization),
we would like to bring to your attenr
tion that we have been working to
obtain permanent cultural, educa—
tional, and community space for our
groups and the campus at large. Cur-
rently, ISO. SOL, and ASIA have
offices in the Forum and Chalutzim
has an office and shared space for
Shabbat at 1127 Park St. These
offices do not adequately meet our
needs. For example, at the weekly
Shabbat Table, 26 people are
cramped into a room that comfort—
ably seats ten. Furthermore, it is
impossible to maintain a kosher en-
vironment in a kitchen shared with
other people. ISO, SOL,and ASIA's
Closetvsized offices must store food,
library, Vax terminals. technologi—
cal resources, files. travel informa—
tion, cultural symbols, and advisor‘s
offices. ASIA and SOL hold their
meetings in the Coffeehouse, but
have had to bump several groups in
order to get their meetingslot. Even
with this meeting space. frequent
lectures in the Forum cause conflict
with meeting agendas and cultural
activities, Having adequate space
wouldpreventthisconflict.Wewant
to assure you that we will not be
taking any permanent . communal
student space such as dorm lounges
and kitchens.

We are writing this letter to

Dear Editor:

In more tion 15 years at Grin—
nell College, only once have I writ.
ten to [he Scarlet at Black. I do so
again, prompted byyour September
15th article about otinnells rout.
lngintherecentU.S.News&Wotld
Report survey or universtties and
colleges.

Thepublicationofonestudent’s
comment about our SoCiology de—
partment was, in my opinion. unfair
and in bad taste. Individual nega«
tive comments can be heard about
almost any department at Grinnell.
Therefore, selection of one com<
merit virtually is a tandem choice; a
poor basis for publishing a judgment
so hurtful to departmental reputa—
tion.

In fact. Grinnell has a good
Sociology department, very possibly
stronger than at any time in the
past.

Sincerely yours,
George Drake
Professor orHistory
To the Editor:

While not indulging in much
self—congratulation over the annual
US. News & World Report college
rankings, I am nonetheless unpleaSr
antly surprised to read in the S & B
article senior Nate Rickard's seemr
ing a priori reasons that Gtinnell
does not deserve its rank in teach—
ing. His first premise, that “We
haveweakethnicdepartments...,"is
easily dismissed (We do not have
ethnic departments), though it is
probablyusefulasareﬂertiononthe
second, and more serious, throw-r
array. that ‘ We have, ,ti \‘,Ll\!\ bUCl‘

ommendations for contract. tenure.
and promotion, My involvement
dtiring the past three years in thor—
ough reviews of all the current soci—
ology faculty leaves me no doubt
that on all three counts theirs is a
strong department. Moreover. there
are many witnesses and much evie
dence from earlier history that the
department is now stronger than it
has been in at least twenryefive prior
years. From like evidence I can as—
sure Mr. Rickard that anotherstrong
department at Gtinnell is philoso—
phy. I hope that. if he was correctly
quoted, and whetheror not he knew
what he was saying. he will go there
in his short remaining tenure at the
College and get some instruction on
the crucial distinctions between
knowledgeandopinion,andtheeth»
ics of how and where to express
them.

To the Editor:

Though Grinnell students are
often known as an idealistic lot of
political actiVists, a rather negative
attitude toward the political process
prevails here. It is not uncommon
for students to condemn the U.S.
political system and then choose to
not exercise their right to vote. In
fact, this apathy and antipathy led
to an extremely poor showmg of
Grinnell students at the polls last
November. and, on a national scale,
these attitudes helped bring Repub—
licans into controloftheU. 8. Con—
gress. Indeed, less than 40% of eli<
gible voters actually took part in the
1994 election. Now, we are suffer»
ing the consequences of those decir
sions as the Congress passes legisla—
tion harmful to students. to the av—
crageAmericancitizen, and, indeed,
to the entire nation and world.

In the next few weeks. the U, 8.
House of Representatives will be
voting on an education appropria-
tions bill which includes the largest
cuts ever made in student financial
aid. According to Vice President
Gore. these cuts wtll cost us the
average undergraduate $3,100 more
in student loans, Grace periods on
loans Will be eliminated; the inter—
est subsidy will be gone; Pell Grants
wtll be much reduced. For those
planning on graduate study of any
sort, the aid picture is even more
grim, both as a result of the com—
pounding undergraduate costs and
from llp<ftont cuts. lil all, this bill is
a bad deal for us, for all college
students, and for America.

 

Scarlett d: ﬁlaellt

College education should not
be a priVilcge restricted to the upper
class of our society. Yet. without
governmcntbased financial aid,
only the wealthy will be able to
afford such opportunities.

The Republican sponsors and
supporters ofthis bill sailed into the
majority thanks to thesllent inaiotr
ity who didn't vote in the election.
Now, we must work even harder to
try to stop this ludicrous legislation,
and work to replace these reaction»
aries With sensible representatives
who will champion our beliefs.
While we may not love every part of
the American political system. we
cannot afford not to participate. Let’s
get in the Grinnell spirit, and let
Congress know how we feel!

Note: Postcards and the ad
dresses of Congresspeople will be
available in the Post Office on Mon«
day to let you voice your opinion.
There is a hotline available to regis—
ter your views With your member of
Congress at 1—800—574—4AID. If
you would like to work more on this
issue, let Thad [MURPHYTJ or Jeff
LAKE] know—there is a lot to be
done.

The 8&13 would like to apol—
ogize to the Sociology Dept. for
the inappropriate quote on the
cover of last week’s issue. Printe
ing the quote was irresponsible;
it should not have been included
in the story.
