During the first rew weeks of
school, unknown faces seem to be
everywhere, from new students/vis—
itingfamiliestonewfacultyandstaff.
This year, however, the college has
bad a problem with people who do
not belong on campus tresspassmg
and creating havoc.

On August 24, a {IYSE’VEZH’
female Grinnell student was
harassed by a non-college stu«
dent. According to a Grinnell
Police Department news re—
lease, an ex—boyfriend visited
the Gtinnell College campus
and posted flyers which gave
the student's phone number and
insinuated that she “did not have
good moral turpitude“.

According to the student, some
fellow Grinnell students saw the fly—
ers and brought them in to Student
Affairs, concerned that perhaps they
were some sort of bad joke. The
Office of Student affairs then con—
tacted the student involved and of»
fcred theirhelp. “lprobably wouldn’t
have asked for help, except that the
posters brought it to the administra—
tion’s attention. and they came to
me asking me if] needed help." Po/
lice are nowexpectetl tochatged Leif
Blakstad of Dennison, Minnesota
With harassment.

The first—year was very
happy with the way that the
campus reacted to the incident.
“I was very happy with the
way [the staff of Student Af—
fairs] treated me— as an indi»
vidual instead of a problem that
they were havmg." She said
her fellow Grinnell students
were “fantastic. They were all
very supportive My SA was
great, and my RLC was always
supportive." She reported that
she received no calls resulting
from the posters, and ex~
pressed her gratitude to the
campus for recognizing that
the posters were not to be tak—
en seriously.

“[I want to] let other wom—
en know that if they do get into
a bad situation that there is
help for them. All they have to
do is get to it." She also encourages

women to report crimes against
them, particularly harassment. “The
peace of mind that you get from
making the decision [to report and
get help] is so much more important
than thinking that it will be a trau—
ma to you. It’s more of a trauma if
you don‘t get the help.”

Students residing at 1128 East
St. experienced a trauma of their
own beforereportingtopolicethata
strange man representing himself as
acollege employeehadenteredtheir
house on August 25 and offered to
move their furniture to storage,

The man moved various peices
of furniture, mostly bedframes, to
the area that the students specified.
Later, however, the students teale
ized that the man was not employed
by the college, and they reported the
event to the police.

On August 26, the police
aprhended a rural Grinnell man and
served him with criminal trespass»
ing papers stating that he is prohib—
ited from all Grinnell College prop—
ery. None of the students’ belong
ings were stolen. Police suspect that
the man was “scoping" the property
for a future robbery.

A third reported incident of
tresspassing occurred here on Sature
day night. Arr unofficial party in a
dormitory lounge was crashed by two
groups of three non—college males.
These people were asked to leave,
but no names were taken. Students
later reported the incident to the
police, but no action was taken, since
no names or physical descriptions
were given.

Officer Teresa Peterson, liason
with the College, and Jennifer
Krohn, Assistant Dean of Student
Affairs have been working closely
on the cases. "i hope that students
are aware ofwhat‘s been going on. I
hope that they will report any suspi—
cious activity to the police or to us
here at Student Affairs," asserted
Krohn. Peterson says that if other
unmvrtedguestsshowup forcollege
parties, students should be sure to
get names and/or physical descrip—
tions before asking them to leave.
She also wants to emphasize that
students should not be hesitant to
call them to remove a person from a
party ifno one can get them to leave
by themselves.

Orinnell safety has been ques»

Grinncll Colle e's Weekly Newspaper, esr. 1394 . Grinnell College ~ Grinnell, Iowa
OLUME 112, NUMBER 1 ‘ FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, 1995

Two students assaulted; police have
one eggplant already in custod

building when a group offive white
males approached himand demand—
ed money. Thestudent refused, and
was assaulted by the gtoup. He was
then taken to Grinnell Memorial
Hospital and treated for numerous
abrasions.

The second assault took place
off campus on August 25, a block
north of the Dairy Queen. Wyatt

walking nort on West St. with two
friends when a car drove by carrying
four or five shouting white males.

Gaswicksays that one of the men
in the car jumped out and demanded
money. When the victim failed to
respond immediately with cash, he
was assulted, sustaining a bloody nose
and elbow. The assailant then tied
back to the car and drove away. After
returning to campus,Gaswick andhis
friends found their RLC, Garry Wile
liams, who called the police

'l'lioughuctenoug‘nev trite-was
found to establish a postive identifi-
cation on the August 23rd assailant,
formal charges were made in the as

.sault onyatt Gaswick, on August

30, Jamie Dudley, 19, of Grinnell was
charged With second degree robbery,
Dudley is currently beingheld in Pow—
eshiek CountyJailon unrelated charge
es. Though Dudley was taken in(o\
custody after committing another as—
sault, police say that a report provid—
ed by Gaswick's friends contained
crucial license plate information, and
ultimately led to the arrest.

Sgt. Hanson of the Grinnell Po—
lice Dept. said, ”There is the possibil—
ity of a connection“ between the two
assaults, though there is not enough
evidence at this point to confirm this.

Police do comment that the vic—
tims in both assault cases were at»
tacked randomly, without provica—
tion. The facts suggest that in both
cases, the students were primarily at—
tacked for money, not because they
were associated with the college.

However,otherassaultcaseshave
been reported by Orinnellstudents in
recent years. A male first»year Stu<
dent was attacked in March '93 on
the railroad tracks north of the Po
rum. Last October Dan Eslinger '97
was attacked byacatload of teenagers
and struck With a baseball bat.

Nonetheless. Gaswick says that
even after his traumatic experience
he feels fairly safe walking in town.
“It’snotlikethis allthetime,"hcsays.
He also commented on the efficiency
of both the Office of Student Affairs
and the Grintrell Police Department.
“They handled everythir: fure."
