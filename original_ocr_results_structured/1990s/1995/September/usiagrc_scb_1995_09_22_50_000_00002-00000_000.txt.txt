SARAH EAGAN
NEws EDYI‘OR

Last Sunday afternoon, 25 Grint
nell students and faculty travelled to
lndianola, Iowa, for the opportunity
to hear Vice President Al Gore speak.
Democrats from around the state
gathered at the Warren County Fair»
grounds for the 18th Annual Harkin
Steak Fry, a fund wiser and field
organizing event for lowa Senator
Tom Harkin.

With an election year soon apt
preaching, both Harkin and Gore
used the steak fry to campaign for
each other and get the area Demo»
crats excited about their campaigns.

The speeches began early in the
afternoon with local elected officials
welcoming the crowd and making
introductions. The official motor—
cade was a little late in arriving, so
the spectators listened to a bluegrass
band from Carlysle, emphasizing the
“grass roots“ approach for which
Harkin’s campaign strives.

Surrounded by the Secret Ser<
vice, Harkin and Gore arrived mldr
afternoon. Harkin spoke first, stress—
ing his connection to the White
Houseandparticularlyhisfriendship
with the V.P. and his family, After

m Harkin

informally announcing his plans to
run for te-election, Harkin addressed
the Farm Bill issue and assured his
contituents that he would do every
thing in his power to fight for their
interests. He also spoke in support of
the Endangered Species Act, saying
that “not only dol support the act, as
the only Iowa Democrat in Con»
gress, I want to apply” for the pro—
gram.

Gore next addressed the highly
enthusiastic crowd, emphasizing the
budget cuts and downsizing of the
government under the present ad»
ministration, and promising more of
the same ifhe and President Clinton
are reelected. He stressed their pro—
grain to “reinvent government" by
reorganizing and streamlining gov»
ernment jobs and reducing bureau—
cracy. Gore addressed the Medicare
issue, responding to the Republicans'
proposal to fund $245 billion in tax
cuts for the rich by cutting Medicare
fundingbythesame amount. He also
spoke out on the proposal to cut
student financialaid,sayingthateach
studcntwillhave to payanaverage of
$3,100 more for each year ofcollege.

The Harkinoffice estimates that
attendance reached about 1,300, and
thousands of dollars were raised for
I‘larkin's campaign.

with the arrival or the Carson
and Barnes Sring Circus at the row.
eshiek county Fairgrounds Tuesday,
more than just the calls of the ring—
master have been heard.

Aaron Gross ’96, leader of the
campus organization, Students in De-
fense of Animals and the Environ—
ment (SDAE) protested the alleged
mistreatment of circus animals,
Along with seven other students.
Gross sat at a table with signs that
read “the circus is no fun for ani-
mals," and “animals are forced to
perform out of fear." They passed out
pamphlets, from People for the Eth—
ical Treatment of Animals (PETA)
which contain a checklist which an
audience can use to mark down any
animal abuses they see.

SDAE mainly objects to the
transportation and training of the

circus animals. “Circus animals are
exotic animals, theyare notdomesri»
cared," Gross says. “Elephants are
very hard to control, and they have
to be beaten to be broken in."

Though mostspectatorsaccept—
ed the pamphlets whichSDAE hand
ed out, including “several professors,
and some Grinnell students," there
were some people who reacted nega—
tively. One man was not only un—
pleasant. but threatening. The man
swore at the group and told Gross
that he was going to hit him “be«
tween the eyes." There was also the
police officer who “directed traffic
very quickly around our table," says
Gross, presumably to prevent circus
patrons from picking up any SDAE
literature.

Though it was cold, Gross seems
to think that the protest was general—
ly positive. “We were there forabour
two and a half hours, and it went
well," Gross says.
