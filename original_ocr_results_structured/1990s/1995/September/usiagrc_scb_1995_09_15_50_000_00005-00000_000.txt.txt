man. That’s right, the man who
brought you Rainman comes to the
rescue of the human race in this
spocolypricdisesserilm. Lotsoi‘gnio—
some screaming death, tyrannical
villainous army generals, and heir
nous vaporizations of small African
villages. Exciting enough to make
you forget ihc cheesy lovc rclsrion—
ship between Hoffman and his ex—
wife, which CoinCILlCS with the killer
disease and the high]; believable
acrobatic flying performed by a rock
iepilotwithonly-40hoursofairtiine,
this flick delivers the goods,

Counterpoint (Mateo): Well.
not much ofa counterpoint, considr
ering I agree with everything Taylor
said, no rnatterhow much that scares
me. Obviously, since this movie
spends a great deal oftiine depicting
smalltownrtiralfolk almost lndistinr
guishable from Orinnellians festetr
ing and oozing, I’m gonna love it,
One particularly stirring scene shows
two good ol' boys in a truck unsucr
cessfullydukin’itoutwithanApache
assault helicopter. I almost wet my—
self. This movie, much like Bambi,
had moments of sorrow, and mo—
ments ofjoy. It will grab you, shake
you around. throw you across the
roominroabigpiieofmemlpors,hut
then drop you in a big, unsatisfied
heap, The very Disney ending Will
leave you with a very warm, sickly
feeling in the pit ofyourcolon. Two
leprous thumbs,

Dave

Well,ifyoti'relookingforasaucy,
yer sexy; hard—core, yet subtle; artsy,
yet not fartsy film depicting Ameri-
can values in modern times, then
this is your lucky day. Dave does just
that, and so mtich much more. Not
only do you get to witness the never
boring,alwaysexcitingmevettedut‘r
dant things that go on in the Whitey
House that don’t involve secret CIA
wars waged somewhere down south,
you also get.,, uh, . not much more.
Oh wait, they do show Kevin Kline’s

naked butt, just in case you ever had
that desire. While his tushle doesn’t
havethe definition,charisma,orsubr
tle wit ofBrad Pitt’s, it is kinda hairy.
Uhh,., now to Taylor.

Counterpoint (Taylor): All
right, I didn’tsharethe same sense of
apathy and repugnance at this film
that my colleague did. I thought it
was quite good, not to mention the
fact that I first saw it on a date with
a girl that I really liked in High
School. She was 5' 11“ ,with long
brown hair and knees that left my
mouthdry. Wesarallthe way in the
back row and...and ..Wowl What a

movie.

Who Framed Roger Rabbit?

This is, in my opinion, Zemeckr
is’ best film. It combines a celebra»
tion/parody of ‘40’s detective films
with a celebration/parody of ‘40s
cartoons to form a delightful flick,
Hey, has anyone else noticed the
similarities between the characters
of Roger Rabbit and Forrest Gump.7
No, really . . . they both have a
certain Taoistic view of life. To be
like a leaf, ﬂoating on the crimson
rivers of life, that is the Way of the
RDleit—Gump, Both Rabbit and
Glimp use the same damn jokes over
and over, both Rabbit and Guinp
have strong female influences in their
lives, both were pseudoreligious fig»
tires in the “70's . . . Perhaps this
reveals something about Robert Ze—
inckiskiman. ,“Fahestl Fahest.‘

Counterpoint (Mateo and Tay—

Blame him, he is the unclean one.

On being a first—year

There’s something to be said
about being a first—year student at
Grinnell, although I certainly don't
knowwhatitis,No,l’miustkiddrng
I think it‘s great that for the first two
weeks, yourpersonality is judgedsole»
ly by your name, home state, tutori—
al, and potential major. This is the
type of information which leads ro
lifelong friendships. While you are
in bed, trying to think ofsomething
witty to say to your new roommate
on those late August evenings sis you
lie in a pool of your own swear, you
am creating unforgettable memo»
ties. (My specific recollections of
that period ot time were: ‘Boy, that
sure sucked')

I admit, a considerable amount
oftime had passed More people got
to know the “real me" last year. It
took nearly a month for people to
realize that not only was I less hu-
morous than a totem pole, I was also
less useful. My flootmates this year
came to this conclusion much earli—
er: 1 think the exact time was 12
minutes, (This is ironic, actually,
since most of us, including me, are
dumb, norrli composiocks) Ithelped
to have a roommate who introduced
me as “Erin, the woman who worked
ALL SUMMER in a factory that
made pumps for impotent men.”

ful, subtle roommms as 1.

Of course, it’s much harder for
people to get to know you in those ﬁrst
fewdays and weeks when you are forced
to do lame bonding activities which
include (but are surely not limited to)
visitingfarms,makingZambakery runs,
and taking whirlwind toursof the bright
and bustling hub of economic activuy
we call Hy—Vee. The highlight of my
f irsr few weeks here had to be listening
to the always-exciting writing lab tu—
tors give in-depth lectures on the hor—
rors of Academic Dishonesty. I recall
becomlng extremely distraught while
attending the lecture, especiallyat the
part where they told us that plagiarism
would cause warts and two types of

cancer. In addition, they casually
mentioned thatimpropet panphms-'
ing would force them to kidnap my

family and ship them all to the Bet—

muda Triangle.

Immediately afterwards, I was
required to write a fascinating paper
on the livingconditions ofltaly dut‘
ing the early twentieth century. If I
recall correctly. my first draft in—
cluded more citatiom thanan entire
volume of the Encyclopedia Brittan»
ica.

By now, I’m sure that most of
the first‘years have adjusted to the
academic sues: and exciting social
possibilities offered at Grinnell.
Many, I have noticed, evenhave the
gall ro ask for rwo entrees while in
the lunch line at Cowles. (oh, the
shame!) Soon, they will be mixing
cerealswithunabashedzealandcorn—
plaining about the mold [but has
formed on all oftheir drinking cups.
Soon, they‘ll be just like the test of
us.

Hopefully, ir will nor take near—
ly as long for this year’s freshman
class to find themselves as it did for
me. Gnnnell, as we all know. is "de—
signed to provide full opportunity for
personal development “ (Academic
Catalog, 6). Truly, college is the
place to build charaCter.

I just wish it didn’t involve so
much mold,
