Computing on campus: questions
answered and myths explained

SCOTT ANDERSON
STAFF WRITER

While Gtinnell College has al-
ways been proud ofits computer sys»
terns, problems with computers and
networks on campus havecausedstu—
dents to question the quality of the
computers and computer semces this
year.

When first year students arrived
on campus, many expressud dissatis»
faction With the computer servrces
available on campus, Manystudents
were disappointed by the lack of wine
portforin—roomcomputing. “I think
you‘ll lose a class of prospective stu—
dents when they discover the lack of
connectibility for m—room compute
ing." said ﬁrstryeat Neil Martin.

A large number ofcolleges have
ethernet network connections in
dorm rooms that allow home com<
puters to connect to central Computr
ing. Most colleges have SLIP con»
nections allowing stutlents to con—
nect in the network via modem and
use programs such as Netscape from
the convenience of their rooms.
Netscape is a program that allows
students [0 evplme the Internet
through pictures and icons.

The campus currently has no
SLchonnections and networking to
the dorms is limited to only a few
labs.

AddingaSLIPcapahilityfotthe
computer system is currently being
tested, according [0 Grinncll col.
legeComputerServicesemployee Bill
Francis. Computer Programmer
Brian McMahon said it is taking a
long time for testing because “the
network people haven't had time to
set it up." McMahon added that
security is an issue because a SLIP
connection gives users too much
anonymity on the Internet,

Ethernet connections in dorm
rooms are not being seriously con—
sidered because “it would require re—
wiririg. and rewiring is a huge exr
pensc," said McMahon.

User SerVices Specialist Debra
Roepke said part of the reason why
the college is not placing a high pTI'
ority on ineroom computing is be.
cause of the extensive computer labs
in dorms, making computers aCCeSSIr
ble to all students. When asked
about adding Netscape to the dorms,
Francis said they are gradually add—
ing it to computer labs where there
are computers that can run it effi—
ciently. Students can already ex—
plotetheInternetthroughtthAX,
but because it requires long com»
mands to be typed and offers no graph—
ics or icons. it is not as easy to use
Netscape. Netscape is currently avail—
able in YMCA, ARH 124. and the
AV Center.

Another concern that has aris—
en is the rule against printing multi—
ple copies of papers. Roepke said
thatmtiltiplecopiesofpapersarenot
allowed for two reasons. The first
reason concerns simple economics.
It costs twice as much to print on the
laser printers as it does to use the
photo copier without considering
wear and tear on the laser printer.
The second reason, according to
Roepke, is ”we want equitable access
to resources. Large print jobs gum
things up for other people."

Many students also question

GCCS' policies on computer games.
UserConsultants explain that games
can’t be kept on the Macs because of
copyrights. “We’re responsible for
what’s on those machines, and we‘re
liable to be sued for infringement,”
said Roepke. McMahon added that
so many people use the games that
students are kept from using the com—
puters for academic purposes.

The VAX system goes down
every Friday night because GCCS
needs to back up the system files. Ir
order to make a complete backup of
everything on the VAX. the system
needs to be completely shut down.
The reasons Dreamsstays down long»
er is because the volume of files that
need to be deleted or backed up is sc
large. McMahon said that 100 mega-
bytes ate freed each week by [ht
cleaning process.

Many of the improvements men:
tioned in this article are planned. but
due to underbudgeting and staffing
problems they’re not going to be
come a reality any time soon. Roep‘
ke said they used to have four staf
members for 25 microcomputers ant
they now have three staff member.
for 700 microcomputers. “Now. jusl
troubleshooting can take up most 0
out time," she adds.
