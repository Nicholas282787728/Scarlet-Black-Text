date's nightmare' a day at the Capitol

with two hundred studentactivists learn-

gressional leaders gave speeches, and information from progressive orga»

nizations was handed out to all who attended.

For energetic feminist and Grinnelljunior Molly Moilanen, the day was
one of the many rewarding aspects of interning with The Feminist Majority

“ltwas so rewarding, ﬁrst ofall, to go in,
and be addressed by all these women
political leaders who are my role mod-
els, and our role models, and to really
be charged by them. We do have a
voice. Our voice is important"

Moilanen, and ﬁve of her co-in»

long and hard to put togethera brieﬁng

gressive organizations to ﬁnd interest~

The day was extremely success-
ful for Moilanen and her colleagues. A
reporter from the Washington Post
even wrote an article about the event.

“We wanted to present to our congressional leaders the fact that our
future and the future of our nation depends on the policies that are in
existence and have been for 25 years " she said. “Right now its the not

issue of the presidential cam-
paign. Current republican candle
dates are painting affirmative ac-
tion as purely a minority-based
issue, Whatthey’re neglecting is
the fact that it's a gender-based

The Internship

The summer was a
dream for Moilanen, a junv
ior political science major
with a Gender and Womv
ens‘ Studies concentration Her internship was funded by a grant from the Noun

program, for which Moilanenapplied to
last January.

The internship in the Feminist Major-
ity, a feminist think-tank. is rated among
Princeton's list of top 100 internships.

“lthinkltheinternship]reallydeserves
that ranking because they taIlor every
work experience to the individual’s skills
and interests," said Moilanen. ”Every
intern has one, two or three projects that
they work on during the duration of the
semester."

WORLD WIDE WEB SITE: The Feminist majority's
WWW page, which Molly Moilanen helped create.
won Impact Onlines best I995 Web Nonprofit Site
for Women. lts address is http://

Publishing. Inc.)

Moilanen‘s school-related project in—
volved helping to create a World Vlﬁde
Web page for the feminist majority.

“The site is very extensive," said Moil-
anen. “I researched the web to see what
was already posted about afﬁrmative ac-
tion and clinic violence. . so the Feminist
Majority’s site can link you to other sites."

The web page that Moilanen helped set up is: http://www.ieministorg. It is the
winner of Impact Online‘s Best 1995 Web Nonprofit Site for Women.

Moilanen‘s project for school was on the topic of feminism and the Internet, and
her colloquium will be in November.

Moilanen‘s third project was to research non-abortive uses of RU-486.

“It is scheduled to be approved by January" said Moilanen. “Right now it is
widely known as the ‘French abortion pill,’ Butthat's kind ofa fallacy because it has
so many other uses. A lot ofthe studies are being cut offdue tothe political struggle
by anti-choice organizations, And it shouldn‘t be a political struggle because there
are so many other uses besides an abortion drug. it also helps in breast cancer
treatment, endometriosis and ovarian cancer. ltcan be used asa‘morning after pill’.
but it also can be used as an induction to labor during regular pregnancy."

Political‘Activism’ :-

“I learned so much about political organization that i will take with me into the
rest of my life. Political organization with a feministslant is deﬁnitely what I will do,"
remarked Moilanen.

Her campus political activism includes working as the executive director of
FEARLESS, as a Domestic Violence Alternatives advocate and working for the
GWS department.

Moilanen has also designed a WWW page for FEARLESS. including photos
from the womens' march in Washington, DC. last year. The site has been created
and should be up in the near future.

“It was an incredible experience to work In an afﬁrming, inspiring informative,
and educational environment Political activism has always been an interest of
mine. This summer solidified that interest and deﬁned my focus more toward
feminism," commented Moilanen. “it is an excellent internship program and I
encourage anyone who is interested in feminist political action to look into it."
