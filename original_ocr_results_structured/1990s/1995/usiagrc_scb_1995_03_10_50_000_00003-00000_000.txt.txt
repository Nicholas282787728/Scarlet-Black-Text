Drake remembeer that when he
was a prospective, the people he was
staying with in Younkcr Dorm had to
wander out in the middle ofnight to ﬁnd
a friend who was dnink and naked and
“lost somewhere on campus," he said.

“Back then, dorms were single sex,
and men lived on north and women on
south," he said. “Students livtxl in the
same dorm all four years, The men’s
domis were like fraternities Am there
were competitions between rlcrrns, men
wore pins according to where ilicy lived,
freshmen worebeaniesand werepaddled.
Each freshman had to buy about five
paddles aweek, andat weekly hnll moctr
ings they were interrogated, and if one
had done something wrong. an upper-

paddle would break."

Drake said that in the 19505 house
panics were common and there was “a
sense ofcamamderie among hallmates."

SCARLET&BLACK- Friday, March 10, 1995 -NEWS 3

Curfews, separate dining halls once ruled Grinnell

Because the men were sepalated from
the civilizing inﬂuence ofwomen (or so
Drake considered it), “boys would be
boys, and there were lots of antics."
FRESI-INUEN female students had
a weekday curfew of 8:00 pm. and on
weekends could stay out until the lam
hours of 10:00pm. Upperclass women
had the respective ettrfews of10:00 pm.
on weekdays and midnight on week-
ends. Men, meanwhile, had no curfews,

but because of the rules for women,
dating ceased at 10:00 p.m., and most
men returned to their dorms early, ac-
cording to Drake. There was a general
uproar around the north domis where the
men resided at about 10:15 pm. every
night when die men returned from drop-
ping off their dates.

But Grinnell’s craziness in the old
days didn’t just haveto do with relations
between men and women, Drake said.

ONCE, during his senior year.
Drake remembers beinginhisroom and
seeing a glow in the sky. He went to
investigate and found a bonﬁre in the
middle ofParkStIeetbyGalesHall. The
ﬁre, it turned out. was fueled by lawn
fumitmefromtheyardsofnearbyhouses.
While Drake was watching the furniture

burn, the student who later was found to
have set the ﬁre, walked up nexttoDmke
and said, “It's getting so a guy can’t get
any sleep around here anymore!"
Ftretrucks andpolioecarscarneenmasse,
Drake said, but while they were there,
someone stole the keys to ihepolioecars,
so they couldn’t be moved for a while.

THIS plank wassimiliartoone that
one that occurred laicriri the dining hall.

“In accordance with the seyega»
tion of campus, women all ate at Quad
and men at Cowles," Drake said. “Stud
dents wanted to have a more integrated
dining experience. so Dining Services
agreed to let men and women mix, but
since they needed to know exactly how
many would eat at each hall. the sides
exchanged similarly sized dorms — all
the women in Road would eat at Cowles
and all the men in Langan would eat at
Quad, forinsianee. 'lhe ﬁrstevenlng this

roof ofCowles Dorm."

Drake said some orthcpmnks were
downrightmean. He mlledihatin the
college’s earlier years each hall had a
house mother who was usually a wid-
owedolderwomanwholivodintheRLC

WHENDrake returned to Grinnell
as an intenrn faculty member in the
1960’s he was more civilized, he said.

He remembered one work ofa jokester
during those years.

“Back then there was a big Cons
vocation every two months, which
all of the college was required to
attend and which was held in Darby.”
he said, “The speaker for its particu-
lar convo was Minnesota Congress-
men WaIter Judd, a republican who
had done missionary work and was a
friend ofthe president. A student hid
alarm clocks timed to go off every
ﬁve minutes throughtout Darby, so
during the speech there were con~
slant disruptions from noisy alarm
clocks."

FROM 1979-1981, one of the big
problems he dealt with was when two
popularprofessors didn’tgettenure. Stir
dents hold meetings with the intent of
irnpeeching Dmkeasprcsidentoverthet
issue. he said,

Grinnell also made the news in
the 1980:. Drake said. when alesbian
ﬁrst-year student married her come
panion and wanted special permis-
sion to live off campus with her
spouse. (At that time, ﬁrst and sec-
ond year students had to live on cam-
pus unless they were married in which
casethey couldlivewiththeirspouse.)
The college decided to deny the
woman the privilege of living off
campus and revoked the privilege
from married heterosexuals as well.
Students banged on the walls of
Nollen House and there was a gen-
eral uproar around campus about the
policy change. There was even Tv
coverage of the demonstrations,
Drake said.

Their reasons, as Drake stated.
werethatifGrinneIl allowed theprivim
logo for students who weren’t legally
married, any student, including hetr
erosexuals, could prey on that and
claim some form ofmarriage despite
the lack of legality. Also, the rule
about living in dorms was made to
encourage students to meet people
and to appreciate the diversity of stu-
dents here,

DRAKE said another interests
'ng event that took place during his
presidency was during the end ofthe
1979 season when the football team
won a game and then won the ﬁrst
game of the 1980 season. This
sparked outrage among the students,
and the two game winning streak
prompted protests by 400 to 500 slur
dents, he said. They were afraid,
Drake said, that the administration
would try to build a football power-
house and overemphasize athletics.

Atari Open Forum on the sub
ject, students basically told the foot-
ball team, “We don‘t want your kind
at this college,” Drake said. Fears
later subsided when the team didn‘t

. win another game the whole year.
