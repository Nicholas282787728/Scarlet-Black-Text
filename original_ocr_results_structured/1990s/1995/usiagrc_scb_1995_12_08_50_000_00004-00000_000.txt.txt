OBRIAN DARR: ”Rythmic Abrasions.” Darr, the one-man campus indus-
trial band Elipton, plays appropriately enough, industrial music on his
radio show.

-PAUL CONN: "Positively Punk.” Conn plays a combination of punk and
hardcore from the genres’ entire history. ”I try to play almost exclusively
bands that are on independent labels I play a little punk-inﬂuenced
ska on the show,” he said. The music also tends toward an anarchist
political bent. Artists include Undertow, Econochrist, Operation Ivy,
Spitboy, Minor Threat, Skunkin' Pickle, Citizen Fish, Screeching Weasel,
Lost Crudos, Jawbreaker, Life’s Blood, Avial, Go!, and Swiz.
