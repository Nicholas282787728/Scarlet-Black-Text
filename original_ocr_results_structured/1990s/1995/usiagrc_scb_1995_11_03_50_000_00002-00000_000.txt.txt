October 29. 1913: Grinnellians launch an intense spirit drive after
losing a football game to Normal. Monday night students meet to
instigate a revival orthe spirit which made otinnell great. The next day,
a self/appointed group called the “Yea»Boes” invaded the college library
and college buildings and “made it a point to see that every college man
and woman not actively participating in the day’s practice Witnessed the
developingptocessfrotn the sidelines.” OnNovembet an, ten days after
the movement was initiated, the SSLB proves the drive is a success and
reports, “Grinnell is the only institution in the world where such a thing
could have occurred.”

November 4, 1936: An editorial condemns those who vandalized a
series of Drake University buildings and writes, "it was more than a
college prank in the spirit of iun, {or it cost time and money to remove
thettacesofthevandal'sbrush " The incident (ookplaceafterGtinnell’s
Homecoming game against Drake and was subsequently blamed upon
orinnell students. The 5&8 reporter writes “The ran name orcrinnell
certainly was not improved by the vandalism which undoubtedly re.
ceived state wide teception,"

November 2, 1956: one reporter broods over the press coverage iii
the Eisenhower vs. Stevenson presidential campaign, claiming the
emphasis on physical appearance is both unfair and unfounded, The
reporter continues “A typical example orthe way Stevenson is shown to
the public is the head/and shoulders picture that depicts hurt as having
rive chins, horrible bags unclet the eyes and teeth exposed in a grin that
seems to betray his intention of hatching an insidious plot to ruin the
rarmer. weaken national deiense and plunge the world into chaos."
Later, the writer asks, “Are we supposed to get the impression Adlai

more comfortably hold the entire
student body, 42 booths plying free

In all, there were close to 150
different items offered at Food Fair,
from laH'ree General Mills desserts

invited to come, sample food items,
and fill out comment cards.

Among the companies at Food
