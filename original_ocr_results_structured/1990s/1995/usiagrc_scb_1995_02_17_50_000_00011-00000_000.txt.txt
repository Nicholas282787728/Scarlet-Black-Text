HE Martial Arts club, which

I started last fall, offers

Grinncll students the chance

to learn the niaitial arts ofTaerkwon-
do and Aikido.

The Alkido club is instructed by
Philosophy departmentmember Eric
Sotnak. Sotnak, who has been prac-
ticing the sport for sixteen years. her
gan teaching Aikido last fall. At the
beginning of the semester as maiiy as
twenty peoplccamc butas the semes-
terended attendance droppedlo about
eight.

Founded in Japan by Mori Hei
Ueshiba (1899-1969), Aikido is
known worldwide but ls especially
popular in Japan, France and the
United States.

“The goal is not just selfrdcfense
bu| also personal improvement," said
Sotnak, ”The overarching goal of
Aikidc ls the peaceful resolution of
conﬂict to the extent that such is pos-
sible under the circumstances. The
ethical underpinning is to lnllicl the
mtnlmal amount of damage [neces
sary] to preserve your own safety and
well being,"

In Aikido, one trics to upset the
balance of an attacker. Because this is
notdcpendenton strength.Aikidocan,

by a small person on a large person as
by a large person on a small person,

The Aikido club meets from 4:30
to 6:00 p.m. on Monday and Wednes-
day afternoons, on the second floor of
thc PEC. Anyone interested in joining
should show up in loose clothing,
Sotnak said.

In contrast to Akido, Tac—kwonr
do originated out ofa more primitive
sport called Subak in South Korea
over two thousand years ago. Tac-
kwon-do is a very aerobic sport which
consists ofaboutés percent leg move-
mClIl,

“One of the things that distin-
guishes [Tamkwonrdo] from Kungrfu
and Karate is the leg movement, Be-
cause we have more leg movements,
our kicks are more advanced," said
instructor Chungkyu l-ian.

I—Ian tries to keep the classes as
informal as possible in order to relieve
some of the tension and competitive
feelings of Tae»kwon-do and to prcr

championships. Coach

Will Freeman wants his Grinnell
College track team to bein high gear.
The Pioneers have a chance to fulﬁll
their coach’s wish this Saturday at
the University of Wisconslnr
Platteville Invitational.

“We have had a lot ofillness on
the team so some of the athletes are
not performing well in meets. It is
very early and we are about three
weeks behind our competition, but
we need to keep plugging away with
our training," said Freeman.

Last weekend the Pioneers, de-
fending league champions, got a
glimpse of their rivals, Monmouth
and Coe,

“They are impressive,H said Free-
man, “Both teams have a lot more
depth than us."

Monmouthwontheloop’s south-
division meet with 18] points while
Coe was second at 135 1/3. Grinnell
edged Knox, 71.57, for third.

Forlhe pioneers, the highlightof

the meet occurred when Tony Perez
set a school record in the Lriplejump
to claim first place. Perez leaped 45‘
s l/Z" offa shortened approach.

“It looks like Tony is ready for a
great senior year" said Freeman.

Chris Mills was Gnnnell's other
ﬁrstrplacc finisher with a time of
15:47.58 in the 5000M,

“I liked Chris‘ race. He looks
like a favorite in the distance events
at conference," said Freeman.

Several ther performances that
caught the coach’s eye. Mark
Mulholland ﬁnished fourth in the 55
hurdles. Bryan Rebar scored a time
of 2:00.89 which took third in the
800, Shannon Robinson came out of
the slow heat toplace sixth in the 600,
The 4x400 relay unit ofRebar, Brent
Dcxter, Kevin Nothcis and Mark
Schliekelman placedthirdin3t32.84.

“Right now we need to get some
interval work during training. We
have a long way to go before we can
catch Monmouth and Coe, but I think
we can ﬁnish in the top three of the
league," said Freeman.

The women‘s track team is also
looking forward to this weekend’s
trip.

STABLISHING respected

is often an uphill battle. The
women‘s rugby team has experi-
enced difﬁculties, but it is preparing
for the spring season with an upbeat,
optimistic attitude.

During the fall season, the Hare
pies went winless and scoreless, but
saw things start to come together
towards the end oftheir competition
schedule. Team members felt the
women began to communicate beta
ter and became accustomed to play-
ing together.

“At the end of the season, we
were playing aggressively and hold
irig our own against more experi-
encedteams,"said I-IeatherFlaherty,
match secretary.

“I thought we showed a lot of
spirit as a team," ﬁrst-year Megan
Northway said.

There is typically a lot of first.
year participation in rugby, includ-
ing many women who have never
played the sport before. Because of
this. the fall season is often spent
acquainting a new set of players to
the game and its rules.

Because the team is now larger
and more experienced, the women
have high hopes for the spring sear

son. The players who were new to
rugby in the fall now have several
matches behind them. The club has
also been recruiting players from
othersports teams. bringing the num~
her of interested students up to 50
this semester.

“I heard [rugby] was fun. and it
[required] less commitment than
track," Said Geny Riester, a new
team member, as she explained why
she decided to play rugby.

The spring schedule is shorter
that the fall one because the season
only lasts from after spring break to
the ﬁrst week of May. The team
has a busy agenda though, and will
be competing in several tourna-
ments. Unfortunately, all the
matches scheduled so far will be
played away.

Practice started Saturday. Feb.
ll, and will be held on Mondays,
Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays
for the rest of the semester. In
addition to typical matches and pram
tices, the Harpies will be hosting 8
Harris party on April 15th.

Goals for team members in-
clude everything from working on
unity to learning how to play rugby.

“Winning would be great,"
Flaherty said, “but we're mainly
just trying to make this fun for
people."
