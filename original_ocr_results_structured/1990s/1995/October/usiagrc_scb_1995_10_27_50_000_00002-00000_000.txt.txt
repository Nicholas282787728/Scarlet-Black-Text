October 24. 1900: Although an 5&3 reporter observes that
“editorials usually slide out of people’s minds like water from a duck's
back," the reporter persists to chide Grinnellians for their lack of
support duringa recent Minnesota/Grinnell football game. From the
game the college contracted a $39.05 debt and only made $24.60 in
game receipts, despite the attendance of 97 students, faculty and
alums.

October Z4, 1936: The 8&B continues its tradition of delving
into the intricacies of male and female relationships by reporting
what current Boston University women View as turn—offs during a first
date. The list of possible male faux paus included. "Don't pun all the
time, don’t spend less than $.75, don‘t wear red neckties and don’t go
without garters, don't eat onions, chew gum, or drink when out on a
date, and don't ask a girl to spend any money."

October Z7, 1950: The SSLB prints and article entitled “Calling
All Men" which expresses a general concern over men‘s lack of school
spirit in comparison to their female counterparts. The article
threatens, “women are taking over in the spirit, if not in the ﬂesh,”
and predicts, “we will have, and deserve to haveI a woman president
in 1960, be she Democrat, Republican or Feminist."

October 11, 1975: Presidential candidate Fred Harris, a former
Senator of Oklahoma, addressed the campus concerning the need for
“a fairer distribution of wealth and power in America."

October 20 1978: Pamlleling the threat of crossing 8th Avenue
to “being struck by ﬂying bnissels sprouts in Quad" or “decapitation
by frisbees in the hall” students propose putting a stop sign at the
comet of 8th and park, After talking to Grinnell’s police chief, who
didn't see the need (at asropsign, the 8&3 observed that “apparently,
students have been doing a goodjob dodging cats." The staff suggests
that students can always pelt cats with brussels sprouts if the town is

 

unwilling to erect a stop sign to slow traffic.

 

 

Campus Democrats
meet the President

KATHARINE JAGER
STAFF WRITER

Some of us went home over fall
break, others did community service
work, many went camping. And
some people got to shake President
Clinton’s hand.

On October 20th, close to 20
Grinnell students travelled to the
Veteran’sAuditoriuminDesMoines
for the statewide annual Jefferson
lackson Day Dinner sponsored by
the Iowa Democratic Party

According to Jeff Lake ‘96, the
fundraiset was a dinner, for which
people paid "upwards of $60 a tick.
et.” The students, however, attend
ed a rally in the parkinggarage below
the auditorium and then sat in the
balcony overlooking the floor of the
fundraiser.

“Close to 1,lOOlowacollege stu—
dents attended the rally,” says Lake.
“Senator Harkin spoke," Linnea Os—
tling ‘99 recalled, “and there were
student speakers from Drake, Buena
Vista, and Coe.”

After this, Harkin introduced

President Clinton, who spoke about
the cuts in federal funding for stu—
dent aid, environmental issues, and
diversity. “Everyone had signs and
they wete cheering,” says Ostling.
Elizabeth Perrill ‘99 similarly noted
that she “could really feel the enthu-
siasmahout getting something done;
people still believed that they could
make a change."

Chris Gilbert ‘99 noticed that
"Clinton’s speech to the sriidents
was much more focused. more spe-
cific and clear,” than his speech to
the adults at the dinner.

“The main criticism of
Clinton is that he never really gives
his own opinion,” Gilbert said, “and
when he spoke to the paying crowd
he watered down his whole speech.
But when he spoke to us, he was
impassioned, genuine,"

Lake echoed Gilbert’s sen<
timent, saying that “Clinton hon—
estly, truly believes in young peo—
ple.“ Ostling added that she “really
listened,” to Clinton‘s speech. and
thatshe“feltasiflcouldvoteforhim
with a good conscience."
