After these last few sparkling
fall days, I realized that there are
many people whose blithe and care—
free personalities have allowed them
to take full advantage of this wealth»
er. I t is unfortunate that none of
these people attend Grinnell. While
the rest of the world climbs trees and
flies kites, we are stumbling around
in a sleepless stupor trying to conju-
gate the French verb “to be" in all
470 tenses. (“Hee!" commanded one
friend to me as she stared at one of a
thousand neatlyprinted note cards. I
must admit, if I hadn't had 2i SOCiOlD'

This weekend there are no mov—
iesbeing shown at rhe movie house,so
Taylor and I decided to share with
you our personal favorite movies and
give you a taste ofjust what goes on
in our minds through our Cinematic
pleasures. These are the movies that
have inspired us during our rerma.
tive years. They have guided our lives
and sculpted us into the men we are
not, So take a little juume‘] into our
souls...

Dead Alive

(Mateo) This is a movie l’d rec—
ommend to the young and old, the
rich and poor, and boys and girls
everywhere. A touching tale of love
and desire in a small New Zealand
town, Dead Alive will bring even the
most rugged and ruff beer swillin’
football player to tears. Lionel, the
nervous et boyishl charmingpro-

gy exam later in the week, I might
have considered it.)

The recent lunch lines at Cowles
are about as close to anarchy as we’ve
gotten this year, and it’s only getting
worse. We’re falling apart faster than
Monday night's cornbread,

Atthispoint, Burling is the place
to be. Many people went all out to
get the full Burling experience this
week, armed with books, coffee, lap-
tops, sleeping bags, matches, tinder,
etc. Often I don't realize how much
time I’ve spent in the library until I
take a study break in the listening
room and discover that I’ve already
einoyed listening to the entire Frank
Zappa collection. I fully expect to
have an Erin Peterson memorial desk
plaque afﬁxed to my place of resi—
dence on the second floor after I
leave.

Although many people detest
the library, I am a proponent of any
place that gives one the opportunity
to read the comics in half a dozen
different languages. For only a nick—
el, you can photocopy your head and
turn it in as a bargain-priced senior
picture. And, with a little planning,
you can drop a box of helicopter
seeds from the second floor on the
unsuspecting victims below. (This,
ofcourse, is purely hypothetical,since
I haven’t had a devious thought since

I entered this fine institution of high—
er Ieaming last year,) During those
long nights at the library, you can
also browse through countlessenter—
taining books, which include (but
obviously are not limited to) The
Bowlers Manual (4th edition) and
A Selection of19tli Cen rury Chairs
I have also found that it ispossible to
spend upwards on 17 making copies
of microfilm. I could devote an en—
tire column to the Butling basement
bathroom (andl probably will some
time in the near future in order to
addtomyalteadylengthylistoflanle
column topics), but I will refrain,
seeing that it is often difficult to
convince people of the ptolundlty
and sincerity of thoughts coined
when one‘s pants are down.

I realize that there are a few
people who aetually want to study
when they go to the library; these are
usually the cranky sort who spend
days on the fourth ﬂoor, giving looks
that could liquefy Jell—o to anyone
who would rudely attempt to unrip
their bag.

After my midsems are done,
hopefully I will join those free spirits
who roam around With their eyes
focused on the clouds and with pine
sap ontheirhands. Probably, though.
I will rust pack my bags and (pardon
my French) flee,

it, my friends and I would be happy to

Army of Darkness

(Taylor) I just saw this movte
last week, and it was fabulous! This
film is the third installment of the
Evil Dead trilogy, but you don’t have
to see the first two for this to make
sense, though I highly recommend
watching the first two. Evil Dead is
packed with action and humor of a
kind I have been waiting on for a
long time. Finally a hero who kicks
ass and has absolutely no modesty.
Gimme some Sugar, baby!

The Female Dirty Dozen

(Taylor) 'Ihis ramp; is in honor
of the Langan second underground

first class! It has no plot, no clothes,

and lots of trios. If you would like a

you check the Langan bathrooms.
