HEN Sophmore artist
Matt Saiia stored 20
large sculptures in his

~room last semester, no one seemed
to mind. Really,

“I had enough storage space in
my room," he stlys."and some ofthe
extra pieces were stored in my ear."

Roommates and friends were
more visually impressed with his
work than worried about the space
that it took

Saiia's friend Brett Pearson
commented, “(His work] is defi-
nitely not your average putrilruprnlr
tha-grandparcnls-home type of art,
You don‘t look at it and see a 17th
century person. But when you see it
itjust impresses something on you,
My favorite is his recently completed
work that I call Bottle Opener. ”

Roomate Dan Esllnger added.
“I‘m pretty fond of it, he‘s always
doing everything abstract, Somer
limes he will be sitting in the room.
and get some ideaofform or shapes.
He will whip out his notebook and
sketch the idea, then ask us which
shape we like best. Usually later we
see it in a sculpture."

As a sophmore, Saiia already
has an amazing art record. He is
near completion ofhis requirements
for an art major. Last year he won
the Grinnell Zirkle award for sculp~
ture (as a freshman). He even had
his own show last semester in the

forum. When considering these ac~
complishments, the fact that Saiia

doesn't like art competitions is

Matt’s primary focus is in

large abstract pieces. “I like things
that are larger than three or four feet

differently. They relate to them on a
more personal level, on a more one-
torone, sort of like people relate.
When you come up onto a small
bowl or a small sculpture, people
usually lhlnk ‘cute.’ You get the
sense that this is something that you
can hold and posess."

His redwood and bronze sculp-
ture completed last semester Saiia
considers his favorite piece so far.
Adding, “Ofcourse, my bestprOJect
is always the one that I’m working
on." The idea for the piece came to
him as he was thinking about inte-
grution. The sculpture currently sits
in Matt‘s room, at a height of over
six feet. One might suspect that
such a gigantic piece would bother
his roomates, but it doesn't at all.
“We use it as decoration. All of us
like it very much." said Eslrnger.

Saiia’s inspiration for his ab-

stract pieces usually comes from
shapes he sees in nature His imagir
nation supplies the rest.

“A lot of people seem to feel
like they need to get some sort of
political agenda in their art, or
some sort ofdriving force, They
go out and look for something
that gets them stirred upAthe en—
vironinent,,or womens issues, or
something like that. For me, its
really more basic than Ihat.
Most of the stuff that I do is
purely aesthetics—what I find vi-
sually appealing."

As for the future, Saiia will
spend next semester studying sculp-
ture at the Glasgow School ofArt in
Glasgow,Scotland,where, hopefully
“I can get my fill," Eventually, he
willcontinuetoGraduateschooland
pursue a degree in art to eitherteach
or become an artist.

 

 

THU WEEK AT THE MOVIE HOUJ' E

By ELEANOR DODSON

Staff Movie Reviewer

OUISA May Alcott’sclassie
L novel, Little Women has been

translated into film many
times, but this most recent adaptar
tion stands above the others. Gillian
Armstrong (My Brilliant Career)
draws an intimate and tender porv
trait of the path of a family.

Little Women is a beautiful
historical piece, down to the c057
tumes and settings, without feeling
weighed downin period. Armstrong
acknowledges the female perspec—
lives which could diminish this pres
feminist story without forcing an
updating which would have felt un-
natural. But by no means is this for
women only.

Little Women shines due to su-
perb casting. Winona Ryder tranr
scends her recent appearance in Re-
ality Bites with a vibrant portrayal of
JoMarch,anindependentwrilerwho
loves her sisters and finds her iris '
ration to write about them. Trini
Alvardo, Claire Danes, Samantha
Mathis, and Kirsten Dunst play her
sisters. Danes especially stands out

as a luminescent Beth, Presiding
over the household is Susan
Sarandon as a subdued, but still
strongmodler. Gabriel Byme. Chris-
tian Bale, andEric Stoltzare the men
in these women’s lives.

Little Women ls often regarded
as a classic children's story, yet this
ﬁlm will appeal to adults (and stun
dents). An-nstrong is smart enough
to coax emotion from the viewer by
involving you so deeply in the story
and characters that you want to cry
because you feel genuineache, rather
than trying to force pathos as in a
standard tear-)erker. The result is a
quiet reminder of thejoy and pain of
family without any traces of artifir
cial sweetness or sappy triteness.

Crooklyn

A Spike Lee ‘joint‘ about a
family struggling to raise ﬁve difr
ﬁcultchildren in l970’sBrooklyn.
A”Slicecflife"picturefocusingon
the special relationship between the
mother and her daughter, Troy.
Basically, we felt this ﬁlm was too
long and at times we couldn’t tell
where it was going. However, the
characters were well done and at
times very funny, so it wasn‘t a
total loss.
Harrir: Friday 7:30pm and Sun-
day a! 3:00 pm

Chaplin

Robert Downey Jr. stars as the
immortal silent ﬁlm star Charlie
Chaplin. This picture was an exv
rellent portrayal of Mr. Chaplin's
tumultuous career. Unfortunately.
this career spanned over eighty
years. Yep, yell guessed it. again
we thought the ﬁlm was way too
long (we both have the attention
spansofhyperactivefiveyearolds).
Still, Downey gives a surprisingly
fine performance and overall this
movie was better than we expected.

Ace Ventura: Pet Detective

For the ﬁrst time since “Surf
Nazis Must Die", we have a split
opinion on a ﬁlm. While Derek
thought the movie was a triumph of
American comedy destined to be-
come a timeless classic, Craig
thought it sucked, Jim Carrey plays
an eccentric (extreme understate—
ment) pet detective hired to ﬁnd the
kidnapped mascot of the Miami
Dolphins, Says Derek: Ifyou are
not familiar with Jim Carrey hu-
mor, deﬁnitely go see this. Says
Craig: Be afraid, be very afraid!

Natural Born Killers

This is the one movie we were
really psyched to see this week, but
it isn‘t out on video yet and we
don‘t get private screenings. We
do know that this ﬁlm is directed
by Oliver Stone, and we hear it's
pretty good. Probably lots of kill-
ing and stuff. We’ll be there!
