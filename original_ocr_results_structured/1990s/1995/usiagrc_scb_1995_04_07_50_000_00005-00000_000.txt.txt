Students shut down dialogue
when they take offense

Recently, students protested acts of i-ac-
ism on campus. While two ofllte lnCl~
dents mentioned are cit-airy inexcusable,
one, I feel, was only ignorance. The
response to thal incident was rampant
hypersensitivity, wrih no room allowed

for intelligent and educational dialogue.

The fans who used it at a game were
wrong. The excuse the college radio disc
jockeys gave was that since an artist used
it in asong they played, it was all right for
them to use it.

The [editorial] wnlten in the paper
was not meant to be racist The author’s
remise was that multiculturalism is not

proof some statements whose validity he

Media censorship is not the
solution to campus problems

By RIVA SHARPLES
Editor in Chiet

never thought that as Editor in Chlef of the Scarlet & Black, I‘d be asked
I— even pressured — to censor the content of this paper. However, in the
past several weeks, as Grinnell has discussed the heated issue of
multiculturalism, I’ve beenasked by students and even bySPARC, theStudent
Publications and Radio Committee, to ccnsor what appears in this newspaper.

In reaction to Chris Pallas‘ editorial, I received two phone calls from students
who asked why I allowed his opinion to be pnnted because it “only caused trouble
and pain on campus." Not long after, SPARC came tome and wanted to know my
policy regarding die useol'wordsllke “colored"aud otherpossibly offensive terms,
They suggested that in the future I edit words, phrases or opinions that might be
considered offensive more closely. Alter Derek Westfall's letter to the editor
appeared, in which he denounced attacks made on Pallas, I received a phone call
from a student asking why [would even publish such a letter. “His letter will only
cause trouble," he said, “I don‘t think you should have published it."

Not only were these comments shocking, but the attitude behind them is
frightening. lit a country where tree speech and freedom of the press are pinnacles
of our country’s foundation, it is not the
Jobiand should Itcvcrbc the tlutyiol‘
any objective newspaper to censor its
contents Obsceniuesand\tulgar-ttyaside,
a newspaper. especially at what is sup-
posed to be a “liberal institution." should
be the forum for expression and discus
sion of different thoughts and opinions.
While it is true that every newspaper
“censors” its contents to some degree
through its news coverage, story topics
and photos, no newspaper should cverbe
asked to censor personal opinions ex—
pressed through letters to the editor or
guest or staff editorials. When we start censoring the droughts of others, we

eventually lose our own ability to voice our opinion.
Often, some letters to the editorcan notbepn'nmd due to space constraints. In

such instances, letters that reﬂect a diverse range of opinions are selected. At the
Scarlete’ZBlack, if letters Similiarrn contentamsubmittod, those received ﬁrst (and
by the deadline of noon on Tuesday) are published before others

Beyond these fundamentals, the different opinions expressed in recent letters
to the editor and in editorials should not be censored merely because for once the
campus is actually talking and debating an important issue that affects us all. The
Scarlet & Black did not create the debate about multiculturalism as some have
claimed, but rather the newspaper sparked die discussion of an issue that had
undoubtedly been lurking in the minds ofmany Gnnnellians for a wlule.

And this is exactly what a newspaper, especially a college paper, should be
doing—encouraging debate and discussion of current issues Aflerall, if differing
opinions are never expressed, how will the ”problem" ever be identiﬁed and a
solution or understanding reached? Before we throw the blame forhealed tensions
on campus at the newspaper, we should all remember that change and progress
come through dialogue— not inaction or censorship iand that in order to have
a discussion, we need to know what opinions and ideas are out there.

can students who wcrcdeeply distressed
at recent experiences and reports of racist
slurs, behavior and innuendo by some
members of the campus community.
As one form of response to this
report and as one sign of support for the
rights of all in the college community,
members of the faculty approved by
acclaniatiort the followtng statement:
“We strongly advocate freedom of
speech. civil rights and human respect at
Grinnell College, We value all kinds of
diversity, including cultural and ethnic
divcmlly, that are conducive to the corn—
tnon good ol‘tlte cotunruntty We cone
denin any behavior which infringes or
Injures the human rights, civil ngtio or

deserved respect of any individual or
group to the college community."

It was noted that this was not meant
to seem a novel resolution, since it is
essentially the long-held and recently
reiterated ofﬁcial position of the College.
Sull its meaning and standards seem to
require continuing teaching. One might
add that while freedom of speech and
civil rights are basic conditions of a
civtlized and tolerant society, proper re-
speet for one's fellows goes beyond law
and is the ideal of a humane and enlightr
erred society.
