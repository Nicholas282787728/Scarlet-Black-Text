November 10, 1909: An SrStB article observes “At present
there is no place or agency which is responsible for gathering and
preserving in proper form all the many printed programs, bulle—
tins, publications and other things ofhistorical interest and value
relating to the college.” Before recommending that such an
agency or place be designated the writer continues “These [pub—
lications] in a very few years if properly gathered and preserved
would come to have a very great value."

November 10, 19 The Curriculum Committee amends
the “unlimited cut pri ilege” for seniors and juniors, stipulating
that it the privilege will not apply preceding and following
vacations or when a senior orjunior has a grade below “8” (which
was defined as a high B or low A.) Earlier, the committee limited
Freshmen and Sophomores to 9 cuts a semester (from 14) before
they lose an hour’s credit.

November 12, 1965: Students are upset once again to learn
that the college will be raising tuition in the following year.
Although they argued for a guaranteed comprehensive fee, the
trustees rejected the plan because figuring tuition increases every
year “makes budget planning easier." The raises in the tuition
amounted to a total of$130, bringing the comprehensive fee to
nearly $3,000.

November 13: 1981: The 5&8 alleges that Orinnell has
illegally elected their SGA president and invalidly selected their
Judicial Court, The accusation comes after a review of the SGA
Constitution which states that the president must be elected 2
months before graduation exercises begin and before any other
SGA posts are elected, The April 8, 1981 election which made
Doug Rowe ‘82 the 8182 president occurred little more than 1
month before graduation began and after the Vice President had
already been elected. Andy Cameron ‘82, the 81—82 election
board chair, admits that the school currentlyhas an“illegal" SGA
president adding only, “We did nothing to contravene the spirit
ofthe Constitution...but that wouldn’t hold up in a court oflaw.”
