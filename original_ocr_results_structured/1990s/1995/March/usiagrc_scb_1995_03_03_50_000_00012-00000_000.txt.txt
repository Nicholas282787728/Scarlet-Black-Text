”Minority Houses Important. but Burt’s
Logic is Flawed" by Doug Wood, we
studentshavecerminly become frustrated!
But not by African American, Asian,
LatinoJewishandIntemationalstudents'
strident efforts to built community. We
are frustrated by mainstream Anglo stu-
dents’ lack ofefforl. The message we are
getting from the aforementioned is that
the rninonly groups on campus are theme
selvesresponsibleforeducatingthemain-
stream and for making sure that Anglo
students feel comfortable. It is not theij
forpoopleofcolortoaccomodale Anglos.

lash type statements presentcdin boththe
article and the lemr, and want, as a pre—
dominately Anglo group of women, to
speak out against the statements made by
our fellow Anglos because wedonol feel
that they represent us in any way.

The ﬁrst issue which Chris Pallas
brings up is that most Anglo mainstream
students have neither the time nor lncer‘r
tive to educate lhemselvesaboutminoriry
cultlu'es by taking classes. This is called
laziness and it really means slewing in
ignorance and complacent power posh

someone to learn about other cultures.

itself. The whole complacent attitude

Don't worry, Anglos are not in danger as
long as they have the power privileges
associated with Anglo mainstream SOCI-
ety. He cites this sort of “demand" as
being ”reverse racism." THERE IS NO
SUCH TI'HNG AS REVERSE RAG
ISM! Racism is racism and it requires
power, which Anglos have and people of

simply prejudice, which is a personal
problem, not an institutional problem of
the magnitiude of American racism,

Action, multiculturalism
in recent weeks, people in Grinnell and in
the reslof the country have been evaluat-
ing issues of diversity on campuses, in
their workplaces and in their neighbor»
hoods. Ihavereadthcmany articles about
mulucullumlism in the Scarlcl & Black
and I have discusscd these issues with
several members ofthc campus commu-
nity, It seems timely to rccmphaslm that
Grinnell does not use shiﬁing standards lo
accept students or to hire members of the
faculty, staff or adminislralion.

Grinnell‘s mission is to prepare its
graduatestobcsucccssiul and responsible
members ofthecoinmunity inwhichtliey

llveinadiversesoclety and they wrllnead
a broad understanding of intcmatioirnl
issues. Therefore, we strongly support
diversity as a component of the under-
graduate experience at Grinnell.

To accomplish this goal, the college

Indeed, we set high standards to become

Student calls Pallas racist

Beforelrackle lhe Pallascdilorial I would
like to write about the last few weeks at
Grinnell, AtLhc second to last Basketball
game ofthe season, the lirword was used
repeatedly by Grinnell students, These
students also shouted racial epithets at the
only African-American player on the op
posing team Dining the second week.
aﬁimralive action jokes became corn-
inon. It appears that some mainstream
students are white with envy (pun inn
tended) at the success of minority stu»
dents. Regular jokes around czuirpus go
something like this: Do you know why
(ﬁllln the name).gollnlome<lical,
law or gmeluatescl‘lool',7 OfcourseIknow.
It is because they are (fill In the
lnlnol'ilyrBlack,Latino/a, etc.) This past
week. one of my professors quesuoned

try department study area, I heard more
comments about minorirymedical school
applicants. Oncstudenloommentedsomer
thing like. “0hr would apply to medical
school, but they only want minonties."
This statement is hilarious to me since
most mainstream schools are 80 percent
white or more. On Friday I had the
pleasure of reading the Pallas editorial.
Chris Pallas’ amcle was extremely
disturbing. His attackon mulliculnimlism
lS unwarmnlcd, He smles, “[ct gear deal
of] racismcan probably bermced l0 xcno
phobia," While Pallas uses this statement
to argue against multicultural courses,
most would cite xenophobiaas the reason
for the creation of these classes. By
makingmainslream studciilsmorc fanni-
lar with ”nonrmainstream” cultures. Such
fcar can be replaced with empathy,
Second, multiculttimllsm in no way
leads to segregation, Pallas series, “the
emphasis on the uniqueness ofa culture
can be taken so far that it leads to the
alienation of other cultures.” De lacto
scgregan'on ofBlacks and other indiVidu-
als occurs at many predominately white
instiluu'ons because nonamainsucam in-
dividuals are not fully integrated into the
social system whenthcyarrive. Most,hut
not all, white students tend to perpetuate
the status quo, or continually bluine ini-
norities for the sttuann, as P311215 docs.
Pallas IS most offensive when he

states “the college also pursues an umbi-
uous afﬁrmative action employment pro

You know. Maslchallas, I am tired
of some white students using attacks on

an outlet for their assumptions of white
intellectual, academicand cultural superi-
onty. Such racist atmcks covered in care-

whites. Lfsuch atmcks continue, if non»
white faculty continue to be judged by
harsher standards then Mr. Pallas your
insightful prediction may be correct.

Gays don’t fit in “pattern
of mainstream society”

This letter is in response to last week‘s
editonal regarding multiculturalism at
GrinnellCollegc, IamgladlhaerPallas
expressed his views on this subject. but
veiy disnirbcd by some of his statements.

Last week, Mr. Pallas slated that
“[m]ost gays fit the cultural paltem of
mainstream society." However, gays,
lesbians and bisexuals, by deﬁnition, do
not ﬁt into the mainstream heterosexual
society. If we filtnto mainstream society,
we would be able to marry our partners,
adopt children and live our lives free of
homophobia.

In his article, Mr. Pallas generously
poinled outthatcxprcssingonc‘sunrquc
tress" only causes l'urlhcr discrimination
inprejudiced people. Iztskyou, what is the
allcmalivc? One cannot conform to the
mainstreaminltopesofbetngacceptod If
llivc my life as a heterosexual, will any-
one learn not to hate and fear- my biscxn
ality? [would not exclude any part ofthc
queer community from a movement to
ward equal rights and acceptance. That
kind of movement would not be about
achieving equality.

As lo llic remainder of Mr. Pallas
diatribe, in a multicultural educational
system one need not take a course in
African—American Studies to learn about
the experience and cullule of peoples of
color. Rather,inulticultumlism transcends
the department. Any rind every class
should contribute to one's understanding
of diverse expencnccs without the need

Pallas misinformed,
editorial lacked credibility

ChrisPallas'scdilorir‘lllzlc incredibilily
How docply involved has he been Willi
issues lnvolv’ mullicultumlism'.7 The
basis ofhls cn in on mullicullurulisrn
is a pamgmph in which he attempts to
explmn multicultural issues such as rac-
ism, miscducalion and the ﬂaws of
Euroccnmcity. By explaining these is-
sues, a degree of kidney about the topic
inrpltcd.

lwould like to address the paragraph
in qucslion (regarding racism.
miscdueation. etc.) What is immediately
appurcntlo me in tins paragraph are glare
lng Similarities between information I
inrpaned on him in a dialogue and infor-
mation presented as his own, Althoughl
was overcome with dcja vu in seeing my
words quoted word for word in Ihe pains
graph. tlriscolrlinclitaly will not degenerr
alcintonccusnlionsnboutplugiansm. Even
in die unlikely event Lhal lhe itlfonrtnlion
presented in the paragraph was not de-
rived from me, it is readily apparent dial
information was not obtained through
long and thoughtful deliberation Rather.
it is evident that this material was simply
appropriated rn order to give a false sense
of legitaimacy to his attacks on
multiculturalism. Thelackofundeislandr
ing of said material is clear within the
aritlce. Throughout the article the writer
contradicts himself and mlsuscs terms. If
the writer possessed a genuine under
standinglhen Iheseinconsislencieswould
not exist. One example of lhcselllconsls~
rencies is the discussion ofEurocenli-istn
asacauseol't'rlcism and diejusuﬁcauonof
Euroccntrisnt in a later paragraph. The
writeracknowlctlgcs lheEurocenu-ic bias.
yet does not propose to eliminate it. This
contradicts his stance as being sympaa
Lhettc to multicultural goals. Another
false claim is that ofl'ighling among min
nority groups on campus for space and
departments, ‘l‘liisisuntrue, Thcmrnonty
groups have been working Iogerliersince
November on lltc space issue, This is
another rnconststcncy which Indicates
misrepresentation of information. Mr
Pall, t gives his audlcnce the lhlselmples
sion that he IS in formed about Ihc issues of
multiculturalism. He gives the irnprcs
sion that he came to Ihese insights regard
ing racism, culnnal anogance, the tlnws
of Eurocentricity and miseducntion
through his own personal lniualive, re-
searchand scriousdeliberdlion aboutlhese
issues. In reality it seems that these in»
sights were hastily acquired and claimed
as his own in order to give his cdttonal a
dchx: ofcrcdibtlily it was lacking.
