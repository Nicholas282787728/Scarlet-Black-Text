RecruitingforDivisionlschools
has become a corrupt ptocess to re-
cruit elite athletes for sports that
exclude most students. How does
Gtinnell turn the tables on Division
I and manage to involve 43 percent
of the student body in athletics with—
oiit scholarships or intense reeniit-
ing practices.7 The answer lies in the
DiVIsion III philosophy otpartieipo.
tinn in athletics

Many o pottunities are avail»
able for stu ents to participate at
Grinnell. “The athletic department
believes in what we do, so we try and
reach as many students as we can."
Fairchild said. For instance, Coache
es Evelyn and Will Freeman will not
take their crossecountty or track
teams to a meet unless everyone on
the team can compete, Everyone
who comes out for the team makes it
because there are no cuts.

Football coach Greg Wallace
said one of the incentives he has for
prospective pla ers is the fact that
they will be ab e to get significant
playing time in their first two years
With the large football teams at oth»
er schools, many players don't get to
playuntiltheirjuniorotseniotyears.

Unlike DiVision 1 schools with
strong alumni booster clubs with
many opportunities for illegal under»
the<rable gifts, there is no booster
club zitGrinnell. instead, allGrinnell
athletes receive a letterman's jacket

sport. According to Faitchild, the

sity is usually a very good team. I
thought we performed well consider
ing it was our first meet."

At Saturday's relays meet Grin—
nell got rid ofits Seasoneopening 11b
rers as most ofihe swimmers record
ed better times than they had the day
before “1 think we were more trien—
tally prepared Saturday," said Hiir.
ley. The tandem of Sonia Cooley
and Li: Welch provided Grinnell
with an auspicious start by Winning
the team diving competition. The
3x100 breaststroke relay team of
Hooper, Emily Hewut and Jennifer
Bloome continued the string of suc-
cess by posting a time ofmcdo on
route to a first—place finish. Also,
Coach Hurley singled out the strong
race by Heather Bell who proved to
be “anice surprise inthe backstroke.”

The women‘s squad has now had
two weeks off to recover and train
until their next meet at Rockford on
Saturday. Last season the women
were the champions ofthat meet and
they hope to retain their crown.
Among other teams they will face
lllinms Wesleyan, Rockford, and the
Illinois Institute ofTechnology are
all strong opponents. "This Will be
another tough meet," commented
Hurley. “The teams at Rockford will
be goodcompetitionfotus. l'mlook/
ing forward to going on the road and
Seeing what we can do."

only way alumni are asked to be in»
yolved in the college is to send in
information about prospective ath»
letes in their area. An alum has set
up a World Wide Web site for the
cross country teams featuring infor—
mation about the team and the coach
es.

Recruitmg athletes at Grinnell
is different from most schools be
cause coaches must find out what
type of student an athlete is before
they can consider their athletic abil-
ity. Coaches also have to recruit
from all across the country. Because
of Grinnell's high academic stan-
dards, coaches lose many potential
recruits.

Once coaches have determined
whether the high school athletes can
attend Grinnell, they begin calling
them. Accordingto Athletic Direc«
tor DeeFairchild,mostcoachesspend
four hoursa nightonthe phone three
to four nights aweek from October to
Aprilcalling potential recruits. Uri»
like most colleges where coaches are
able to sell their athletics programs,
Grinnell coaches have to sell the
school. "When we recruit we try to
sell those abstract qualities that make
Grinnell College special," said Free»
man,

Because Grinnell is in the Mid-
west, coaches also have to overcome
many prospective snidentathletes’
perceptions of Grimell as ii small,
uninteresting school. Volleyball
coach Lori Sadewater and other
coaches said a visit to the college is
the mostsuccessful part of recruiting.
Ptospectives are often attracted to
Grinnell when they see how friendly

Sports ~ ]_‘1

everyone is and how beautiful the
cam usis. Sadewater added thatshe
sen out many personal notes to
prospectives, rather than the form
mail everyone gets.

Student athletes often make the
final phone calls to recruits to 've
them a feel for what colle e life| is
really like on campus, an so the
recruits can ask the questions they
can’t ask the coaches, Current ath—
letes are usually matched up with
recruits through common interests
outside ofthe sport.

A new and popular recruiting
tool that some coaches are using are
recruiting services that help coaches
reach athletes that match well With
the school. These services compile
lists of high school athletes and sell
them to college coaches. A wide
variety of students can be accased;
Wallace used it to get a listof football
players with high GPA’s. This great—
lyenlarges the poolof athletes coach—
es can search through. Recruiting
services are mostly for football and
basketball, so other coaches get int
formation indirectly. Most coaches
simply tece ive information about ath—
letes from a Wide variety of sources
and start their recruiting process by
sending out letters and ﬂyers to those
prospective athletes.

Recruiting athletes is a key part
of having successful sports programs.
Fortunately, tectuiting at Gtinnell
College is adifferent experience from
Division 1 programs. The nature of
Grinnell's recruiting is based on pro
mating the athletic and academic
experiences that Grinnell can offer
to athletes. .
