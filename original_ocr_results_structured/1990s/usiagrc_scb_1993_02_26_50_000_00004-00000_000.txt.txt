policy. At 3:30 pm. today in the
North Lounge, Fisher has planed a
“Speak Out" where concerned stu-
dent can speak their minds on the
housing issue. Fisher also plans to
have students assemble outside of
Main lounge at 4:40 so that they can
communicate with the college trust-

ccs leaving the meeting.

“The way the decision to estabr
lish language houses was wrong."
explained Fisher. “Students should
be the ones making the decision be-
cause [student housing] does not ef-
fect the faculty 1 think that the
administrationshould kriowthatthey
can‘t make a decision that bypasses
the students and getaway with it."

 

 

TRUSTEES item page to

facilitate a constructive idea exchange
between community members and
trustees. First, the trustees need to me
ognize their unrecognized allegiance
Willi sludean and faculty. Weall want
Grinnell to be the best college in the
country. We are not adversaries: our
goals are similar.

Secondly,the trustees need to pro-
vrde the means to support useful dia-
logue. This can be rlone through the
elimination of the secrecy that sur-
rounds virtually every policy decision
this College makes. The Grinnell com-
munity ts not interested in rumors and
whispers. We want solid information
directly from the source.

Provide the college with an effec-
tive fomm to discuss pertinent issues,
This newspaper. for instance. It operr
ates on a shoesn'ing budget and, this
semester, will fail to pay all of its
editors (let alone pay lowly reponers
or editorial contributors) As long as
this newspaper fails to competitively
compensate employees, the paper will
never be an effective tool of the first
ammendmenttInsLead,itwill(re)cycle
from one disgraceful semester to the
next, with only occasional fits and

starts toward respectablity.
Thirdlygivethestudentsandfac-
ully a chance to express themselves
directly to the trustees. As lastweck‘s
student meeting wtth administration
proved. constructiveairingofdtsagreea
merits can occur even in the mostemo-
tionally charged atmospheres. Treat
the college residents like stockhold-
ers, and hold an all-campus “stock
holders" meeting. In this format, the
trustees could present and defend their
policy to any and all interested parties.
Finally, the trustees should rec-
ognize that student ideas are often
serious. and that they should be con
sidered and, at least, responded to.
Just one final suggestion: The
trustees should get rid of that damn
paper screen in Main Hall. We want to
see the faces of the people who hold
the future of ourcollege in their hands.

You’re adorable.

did notplan to vote. 72% said that they had given little
or no thought to the upcoming election, while only
28% said that they had had given at least some
thought to the election. 16.7% of students surveyed
didn’t know where the elections are held (the post
office). A total of 36% didn't know when the elec-
ttons are held (this Monday. March 1).

There appeared to be a strong correlation be
tween a student's choices and which side of campus
the student lives on. 56.1% ofnorth campus residents
favored Chad Finite, while only 5% favored Scott
Ihrig. On south campus. Ihrig led with 38.5%, and
Finke received only 15.4%. Votes for Vice Presiden4
tial candidates were fairly evenly spread across north
campus and south campus. Students who live off
campus were predominantly undecided.

Women and men voted for the most pan about
equally. except that Melissa Watson received a higher

percentage ofvotcs from males, and no women voted
for A. Garth Kranjec.

Chad Finke received 45% of the junior class
vctc. while KirtDankmyerreceived his main support
frotri first year students. Finke led the survey results
in every class except the sophomores. who voted
equally for him and Ihrig.

The margin of en‘or for this poll was relatively
large (nearly 11%), but the spread between presiden»
tial candidates is large enough to accurately indicate
probable trends. While vice presidential candidates
Horton and Lipshutz did not receive exactly the same
percentage of votes. the results were close enough
that no clear leader could be determined.

The poll was conducted for the researchers’
statistics class. They wish to thank their professor.
Tom Moore. for hispatience and assistance. They are
also grateful to Janet Gibson and the members of the
Institutional Review Board for their prompt approval
of this survey proposal in time for publication.

takes that do occur involve“cleaning
up messes that do not have anything
to do with [the FAO in] Grinnell."
The campus community rarely hears
about the positive aspects an office
contributes; it onlyhearsaboutsome—
thing once it is brought up as “an
issue,” Lincoln commented.

Approximately 70% of all Grin-
ncll students receive some sort of
financial assistance. The college's
financial assistaneeprograrn provides
more than59.8 millionannually.The
two most common types of aid at
Grinnell are “gift" (scholarships and
grants) and “self help” (loans and
jobs). Most financial aid packages
combine gift aid and self help. In
addition. financial aid awards often
have to be adjusted for other sources
of funding that may become avail-
able to a student,

More than 7000 ﬁnancial aid
documents flow into the FAO each
spring. As with any other student.
Foreman‘s documents and applica-
tion had to undergo the same. de—
tailedprocess.AccordingtotheFAO,
there are only so many steps of this
process that are strictly under their

authority or visibility, Some steps of
the process are dealt with by other
agencies. such as sources of funding
outside Grinnell.

The documents that come into
the FAO are from applicants from
states all over the country. Each state
has different procedures which the
FAO has to become familiar with.
The information on each document
has to be verified before any ﬁnﬂl‘lr
cial aid awards can be confirmed.

Furthermore, the FAOhasto wait
untilallrequired tax retumsand inner
documents have been submitted and
reviewed. At the same time, these
documean have to be processed in a
timely manner in accordance to cer-
tain deadlines.

For the most part. U.S. students
receive loans while International stu~
dents receive grants. “It’s difficult
enough collecting loans. even in the
United States." said Lincoln. “It‘s
even more difﬁcult to collect across
cultures.”

In the case of Nathan Foreman.
it is probable that there were numer-
ous factors in his financial aid pack-
age which could have gone wronga
perhaps too marry to single out one
reason for his being out of school.
