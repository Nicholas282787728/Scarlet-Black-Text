ANG on to your paint
brushes. Grinnellians: a
new Fine Arts building is

coming to campus and our current
one will beremodeled. The Board of
Tntstees recently approved proceed,
ing witlt current plans for the new
line ans building, and archi-
tects are now working on de-
signs.

rent Fine Ans building and a
new separate building. The
new building, between Hurling
Library and the current Fine
Arts building, will house an art
museum and gallery space, a
studiotheaterandaconcerthall.
The plans call for a total of
7,500 square feet ofexhibition
space to be used for displaying
pennanentannravelinganand
advanced student and faculty
art. This gallery space will be
climate controlled, secure and acces—
sibler In addition. the new facility
will housepreparation space for an, a
seminar viewing room, an studios
and a scene shop

The cunent Fine Arts building
will be completely remodeled. Pro-
fessor Sandy Moffett, Chair of the
building committee, explained the
extent of tlte planned renovation.
“One of the complications is that

with the exception of Robert's tite-
ater, everything else in the [ﬁne ans]
building will be reshufﬂed. This
building will be gutted and re-configA
ured to improve the space for various
departments.” The entire project will
provide more space, ventilation and
acoustics forFineArtsstudents. This
is a much-needed expansion for the
ﬁne arts program. The renovation is

hoped to be completed by 1998, A
potential difﬁculty is raising all of
the funds before work begins.

The recent approval to continue
plansreprcsents alot of hard work by
members of the building committee.
The committee consists of two staff
members from the music, theaterand
art departments, Discussions and
meetings began in 1985 about the
new renovation tong talks involved

getting input from each depanment
about what kind of space they needed.
Aboutthree years ago, ihecommiltcc
had to start making tough choices
about how they could best use the
space. It took a lot of sacriﬁce to
decide what was absolutely neces-
sary for each department As Sandy
Moffett described, “We had to put
our dreams against reality. We were
all willing to sacrifice to keep
from doing the whole thing in a
halfway manner. We really feel
like what we do, we should do
right and we should do up to our
standards, which I thinkarc very
high,"

Kay Jenkins, director of the
Printand Drawing Study Room,
added that the recent approval
was reﬂective of the college’s
commitment to the liberal arts.
“One of the pauses [in the pro»
cess] here was that it became
apparent that what we needed to
have and what the architectural
firm could design for us was
goingto costmorc than whatthe
Board ofTrustecs originally thought
it was going [0. So before we could
proceed with the next design phase.
the board had to approve the first
step, to continue with designs. They
could have said, ‘No, we can’t spend
any more money You have to back
up and reduce the scale of the build
ingioﬁtinio ourbudget.‘ Buttotheir
great credit. they said, ‘go ahead and
design a building that meets the pro-

HORNBUCKLE
Arts Editor
is a new exhibit in the
e Arts lobby, and accord—
ing to I. Carlos Ferguson,
int/erm printmaking professor, this
“Print Trade" exhibit is just that It is
primarily composed of prints from a
trade between Carleton, Macalesier
and Grinnell Colleges, with the Grin-
nell end of the trade organized by
Associate Professor of Art Anthony
Crowley, on leave this semesterr
Ferguson predicted that the same
exhibit is now being displayed at

Macalester and Carleton as well.
“Since prints are multiples, each stu-
dent pulled an edition of 30 prints so
each student in the trade would be able

to have the complete series of works
from all the other students This prac-
tice is traditional at giaduale schools
and between institutions,” he said.

Last March, after long work, the
committee chosean architectural firm
for the project. The firm Caesar Pelli
and Associates of New Haven, Con
necticut was judged to be the best
among many candidates The firm
was chosen for their world art tcputAr
Lion. The firm Still visiLs campus each
month to get a concept of the space.
Kay Jenkins commented on the ex-
citement generated by the architec-
tural firm. “There is a wonderful feel-

campus about this renovation. That

This renovation is a culmination
of years of planning by membeis of the
fine art department, They have been
committed to improving the quality of
facilities for future Grinnellians. “I
really think that what we want to do is

expectations and the level of quality of
the college and its our turn,” remarked
Professor Moffettl

Kay Jenkins also reflected, ”I
work closely with studentan and art
history people and [see theircurricu-

manding, challenging things that are
asked of the students and that has
changed in the past ten years. So
there really is a commitment to irnv
prove and strengthen the entire line
an department. In o er to do that
they need better facili s."
