This year’s Women Take Back
the Night, which was held Thursday
October 29. was especially charged
since the event was dedicated to
Tammy Zywicki. The anger and pain
whichfriendsandfellowstudeanstill
feel about her death was expressed
over and over again during the
evening. Nyasha Spears spoke about
her anger and her growing sexism.
She also stressed the need for action,
action. action.

Many students spoke, giving ac»
counts of personal experiences, read»
ing poems and story excerpts. and
analyzingreeentnewsstoriesandsla»
tislics. Professor Jane Kneller an-
nounced, “...the worse the situation
is, the noisier we will be."

Professor Ana Martinez Aleman
read a letter which she said and aunt
in Cuba had sent her, telling her to be
careful that, “no impona, eres una
mujer sola (nothing matters except,
you are a woman alone)” and her
aunt’s advice to Aleman. and to other
women is, "...you have to live know-
ing that but you have to live with
dignity..."

At the end of the presentation in
the Forum the Sexual Abuse
Survivor’s Support Group conducted
a demonstration in which they asked

any survivors to stand up, then any
family members of survivois, then
close friends of survivois. By this
time nearly every person in the room
was standing.

The exercise proved several
points. First of all is showed how
disturbinglyprevalentsexualviolence
is in our society. Secondly it allowed
survivors and those close to survivors
to stand up together. and in standing
up, in solidarity, to feel stronger and
supported.

from the participants. Marching is a
common way for groups to express

more they have to do before the prob-

solved. Several car loads of young
men, followed, heckled, and threat-
ened the women marching. This was
upsetting and angering but, as one
woman said, “this just shows me how
much harder we have to work.”
