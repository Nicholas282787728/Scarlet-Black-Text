While the Bumie Psykes 5 was
reviewed in The Scarlet and Black
last year, their fans know that the
band is always inventive, never con—
tent to rest complacenrly on their
laurels. I interviewed (our of the
band members. Ben Chlri, Kentner
Cottingham, Mark Messer. and Andy
Hicken, to get the word out to stu—
dents unacquainted with the hand.
Everyone should know “that we’re
good.‘ Come and watch us!” says
Chiri, perhaps with a little natural
bias. The band considers their songs
to be “inspirational music," many
including dental hygiene imagery.

“The band was originally eon.
cewed or at Bob’s" says Hicken. It
was planned as o speed metal band.
Accordingto Hicken,however, when
the band formed. they aetually he—
Came a backing band {or Burnie
Psykes, a legendary bassist (best
known {or his place in the Sex Pis<
tols) The hand memberssaw him on
his tour stop in Seattle. “He fired
Nirvana..." says Messer. The band’s
originalline—upwasMesserondrums,

Their first concert was at ”The
Battle oithe Bands" last fall, opening
for Vivid. Klein left the band nmica»
bly over “artistic differences." and
Peter Lindioined tlieshow, and found
it to be well worth it, for the sheer
energy the band puts into its songs.
They have another show planned,
for the GUM party in Gardner
Lounge, on Friday, October 27th.
Burnie Psykes 5 will be appearing
along with Much and curious, in
addition, the band tells fans to be on

the lookout for impromptu perfoe
mances in the south campus loggia,
near the vending machines. Messer
warns fans against missing a show, as
each show just might be their only
chance [0 heat Burnie himself, as he
rarely shows up when he‘s promised
to. But the band seems to he quite
understanding about this, “Burma's
got bigger and better fish to fry,"
Hickenexplains, The foursome alone
are Still plenty worth hearing They
explain the quality oftheir music as
analogous to fresh, homemade pie.
Burnie's stage presence iust enriches
the ﬂavor further, like real whipped
cream, The band as a whole has
hopes of performing in underground
clubsinJapanoverwmterbreak, For
morefeaSible goals, though, the hand
is considering submittingsome songs
to the next HUM Grinnell Compila<
tion album. Some ofthe hits in the
home Psykes 5 repertoire inelurlo
“Beverly's Example,” “Whiskers,“
”Killequuirtels fromHell,"and“The
Sailorsongzcottmgham’sFirstwaltz
in A Minor."

The band was outraged when 1
reported to them rumors circulating
campus that Btirnie is a mere figment
ortheiroolloetwe imagination “Yes,
Virginia, there is a Burnie Psykes!"
l-llcken insisted, It is for the students
oiGrinnell to oome to Burnie Psykes
