Enc Krauss, ‘94

Titan has a paid staff of 21 andr

usually write every week, not to
mention a student body of over

Given dieScarIelandBlarkstaffol'

that is not a very fair comparison,

in other words, the Scarlet and
Black is understaffed and the only
way to solve this problem is to
provide morcincentives for joining
the newspaper. This means better
equipment, shorter hours. and
salaries or some other form of .
remuneration that, although not the

[hardly consider 30hoursperissue
a “weak commitment!"

I also resent your comparison
of the Scarlet and Black to your
high school newspaper. What you
are forgetting is that 30 hours
per week in college is an inﬁnitely
larger commitment than in high
school. The staff simply does not
have the time or the resources to
devote this much of their lives to
the newspaper and maintain their
academic, social, and psychological
wellrbeing, too.

To conclude,please donotvtew
