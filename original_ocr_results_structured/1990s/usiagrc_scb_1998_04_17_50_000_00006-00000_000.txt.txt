Sports Information

The Grinnell College baseball
team is contlnuing to improve with

every game. Last weekend the slug-'

gers racked up their ﬁfth and possi-

' bly sixth wins of the season, split-
ting a Sunday doubleheader with
Macalaster. 5-2 and 5-10, and drop-
ping one against Knox the day be-
fore in another twin bill. 12-8. The
second game versus Knox was sus-
pended after 5 1/2 innings due to
darkness with the Pidneers leading,
11-10. The MWC Commissioner is
still determining whether or not this
game will be continued when the
Grinnell squad plays next at Knox,
or will count as the team’s sixth vic-
tory.

The Pioneers will battle
Monmouth again on Saturday at
1:00 in their last two home contests
ofthe season.

On Saturday. the Grinnellians
were leading for virtually the entire
game but lost in a heartbreaker to
Knox after 12 exciting innings.

Going into the seventh and ﬁnal
inning of regular play, the Pioneers
looked to have the win in hand with
a 5-4 lead. The Prairie Fire refused
to be snuffed out, however, scoring
the tying run to extend play.

The teams fought a neck and neck
battle, each defense disallowing the
other squad a run until the ninth in-

ning when the Prairie Fire knocked
in another score to take a 6-5 lead.
The Pioneers then fought back
and managed to tie it up again as
David Gearey hustled home to score
on a passed ball. The 6-6 score re»
mained until the 11th inning when
Knox again took a one run lead.

Amazingly. the Pioneers man-

mented acting Director of Athletics
Greg Wallace. “We are going
through some changes in the college

and sports information positions."

ing on another passed ball.
However, the Grinnellians were
unable to hang on in the 12th inning
when Knox slugged in six runs and
assumed the lead for the ﬁnal time.
“Unfortunately, we just did not
score in key situations early on in the
game," remarked Coach Tim
Hollibaugh. “Knox kept themselves
in it despite a great pitching perfor-
mance by Jacob Chavez and then
were able to execute in the latter
stages of the game."
‘ Highlights in the matchup were
doubles by both Chavez and Rob
Martin and a solo homerrun by l.P.

Christiansen.

In the second game the Pioneers
had a much better offensive perfor-
mance, scoring seven runs in the
fourth inning after trailing early, 8-
l.

“I was extremely pleased with the
way that we performed in the sec-
ond game because we never let up
and refused to lose our desire," com-
mented Hollibaugh. “Everyone in
the lineup contributed and despite the
game being halted. we achieved what
we want to in this game."

On Sunday versus Macalaster
Perry Gordon, Christiansen and Mar-

tin all connected for solo homers to
lead the team to its 5-2 victory. Joel
Cladouhos pitched the win and
Michael Munoz threw for the save.

“It is always great to win on the
road," said Hollibaugh. “We worked
hard and had some key hitting. Ifeel
that this was our best game of the
season with the combination of of
fense. defense and pitching we dis
played. Now we are preparing for
Monmouth who is always tough and
fundamentally good. Hopefully our
great fans will come out in full force
this Saturday to support us in our ﬁn
nal home games."

showing this Saturday at the Mid

Knox in a Midwest Conference
opener Saturday at 1 pm before trav-
eling to Illinois College on Sunday.

LastTuesday the diamondwomen
traveled to St. Ambrose where they
dropped a pair, 2.1 and 5.2. “The
most frustrating thing was that we
left 14 runners stranded on base and
our loss in the ﬁrst game came on an
unearned run, We hit well. we played
strong defense, and all 17 players
contributed," offered Coach Torn
Sonnichsen.

At the Grinnell HyVee Invitae
tional Tournament last Saturday, the
Pioneers hosted Mt. Mercy, Clarke
and Graceland. tn the opening game
Grinnell took an early 20 lead over

Lenihan connected for her ﬁrst home
run ofthe season. Mt. Mercy cutthe
lead to one in the sixth beforejump»

“Jan Maxwell was pitching a two-
hittergoing into the sixth. Mt. Mercy
ﬁnally got a beat on her and kept hits
ting it in the hole," explained the
coach. “What they showed us is how
to win in the end."

The second game, against Clarke.
proved to be the matchup of the
tournament. A Steinmetz run and a
homer by Erin Rathjen put the Pier
neers up by two at the end of four
innings. Clarke rallied for ﬁve runs

runs of their own. Clarke's ﬁnal at-
bat included six runs, a surge too
impressive for Grinnell to match.
Although the pioneers did rally for
three more runs, they came up short.

Netmen face
endurance challenge

Sports Information

The Grinnell College men’s tenr
nis team played three matches last
week and is slated to play four
matches in the next ten days. The
exhausting schedule is beginning to
fatigue the Pioneers but Coach Andy
Hamilton remains conﬁdent his team
will emerge a tougher and more com-
petitive club.

“It will be a grueling 10 days,“ he
said. “but we need that to prepare us
for the conference tournament. We
can beneﬁt from this."

Last Wednesday Grinnell traveled
to Waverly without Spenser Piston
and Aaron Wagner, the No. l and 4
singles players. The Pioneers still
managed to down Wartburg, 52.

Knoernschild and Collin Conolly
each recorded singles victories.
Pourciau and Chang won at No. 1
doubles and Knoernschild and
Conoley were victorious at No. 3
doubles.

“r was really pleased With the way
the players competed, particularly
Knoernschild and Conolly who do
not always get a chance to play. They
both won in singles and doubles."
Hamilton said.

On Saturday the full Pioneer
squad took on Augustana‘ and host
Coc. Against Augustana, Grinnell
posted aoel win but the competition
was stiffer than the score indicates.
Piston lost a very close three»set
battle at No. 1 singles, and at No. 2
singles. Pourciau fought for a victory
after dropping the first set. Chang

also scored a threeeset win at No. 3
singles.

Wes Schrock, according to
Hamilton, “used his opportunity
well" in his threeeset win at No. 6
singles. Hamilton also praised the
Piston/Pete Dekock duo for their
“great doubles play."

In their most challenging meet of
the week, the Pioneers lost to Coe,
473.

“We were at a point in the Coe
match where we were down a point
and needed to win two out of the last
two matches and we lost one of
them," Hamilton said, “Itjust goes
to show you that we’re a good team
when all six are playing well. But
we are average at best when our six
players aren‘t."

Chang. a freshman, destroyed an
opponent who has lost only twice
this season and won with Pourciau
at No. 2 doubles. The victories
raised Chang’s singles record to 11-
2 and his doubles record to 10-2.
Nate Solomose turned in a gritty
three—set performance to win at No.
5 singles. The most intense battle
of the day came at No. 1 doubles.
Piston and Dekock played a “fantas-
tic" match but lost, 977.

“I was very pleased with Spenser
Piston," said Hamilton. “He and
Dekock had a great match. The high
light of the entire day was the play
of Dekock and Chang. They were
solid in singles and doubles in both
matches. They are both ﬁrst-years
and already have mental toughness.“
