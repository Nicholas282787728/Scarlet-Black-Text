- With War Talk, There
is No Time for Apathy

Regardless of whether one
agrees or disagree with U.S.
intervention in Saudi Arabia,
each of us is beginning to face
the immediacy ofthis country‘s
actions. By now, with nearly
400 thousand troops involved, most students can name someone
serving oversees in the Persian Gulf.

This soldiermight be a former Grinnell student, a high school
friend, even a brotheror sister. Some students might bc'able to give
a list of friends and family now facing off against the Iraqis.
Whatever the relations. the fact that these soldiers are not nameless
faces in uniform alters our perceptions of the US. action.

PresidentGeorge Bush's call for such a large military presence
in the Gulf also creates another haunting fear. By placing so much
of our military in Saudi Arabia at one time, questions arise about
from where new troops will come to replace those currently
activated.

Ifthe draftis reinstated, students will among the ﬁrst to be called.
They are not automatically exempt. as during the early part of the
Vietnam War, and conscientiousrobjectorstatus may be difficultto
obtain.

Faced with the immediacy of the situtation, students must
consider the consequences of this nation’s actions. Ambivalence
cannot be a response. Whether one supports U.S. involvement or
whether one condemns the action, students cannot ignore the
potential ramiﬁcations of war.

Committee Disarray
Threatens Future

of Gn‘nnell Publications

As one of the media under the
auspices of the StudentPublication
and Radio Committcc (SPARC),
the Scarlet and Black must express
its concern with the current
condition of the committee.

SPARC has a great many responsibilities. It must select the
editors In chief of the Scarlet and Black, the Grinnell Review, the
Freehand Press and the Cyclone as well as the KDIC station manager.
Often there is a dearth of qualiﬁed applicants, necessitating extensive
searches for prospects.

Some of these jobs are semester positions, and new appointments
must be made by the committee before each semester. When this occurs,
the selected media head must also choose a staff.

But with the end of the semester looming closer, no search for media
heads has begun. No secondrsemester budgets have been considered for
Joint Board approval. And no authorization for the selection of second
semester staff has been given. »

With these and other major issues to be discussed. the committee has
instead sunk into inncdvity,Jeopartli/,ing the continued functioning of all
thestudentpublications. Suchan unacceptable situation mustbcrcmcdied,
and remedied immediately. if the current situation involving SPARC
continues, the future of all Grinnell media will be placed in jeopardy.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

So You Won't Fight
for Texaco? No Kidding!

To the editor.

A few days ago, a number of
anti-war protest slogans appeared
all over thccampus. Onesaid: “No
blood foroil,"another: “Wewon‘t
ﬁght for Texaco." From these and
similar slogans. the anti-war
protesters' stand seems to be that
Americashouldnotsendpotcntially
tens of thousands of its sons and
daughterstodealhforthebeneﬁtof
a few big oil corporations.

However, before people get too
exited and start running to Canada,
Isuggestthatthey takeaeloserlook
atthesituation. What would happen
to the nation's economy if a war
broke out? Who would benefit
most,and whowouldlosethemost?

In fact. oil companies would be
among the last who would support
any wm effort to drive Hussen out
ofKuwait. Theinvasion ofKuwait
hasraisedthepriceofoildrastically.
It is true that the oil corporations
has to pay much higher prices for
crudeoil. Butatargcporu'on ofthe
higher costs is passed to the
consumersatgaspumpsandairline
terminals.

More importantly. the oil
companies are now selling their
domestically-produced oil. oil that
cost the same to produce new as
prior to the invasion, ztt a much
higherprice. Allthis means that the
oil companies are making a
tremendous profit from the
invasion.

What would happen ifthe U.S.-
lt‘dallies l'reedKuwait'.7 In thelong7
run.theoil supply would nsewhilc
its price would tumble. The oil

companies by no means would
starvemdealh.butl.heirproﬁtwould
certainly drop. All in all. blaming
oil companies {or the...imminent
warsimplydoesnotmakeany sense.

It is no secret that America is in
a recession. Higher energy prices
brought by the crisis has cenainly
deepened the recession. When the
economy is in trouble. the working
class and the poor are the hardest
hit. It is the average Joe and lane
who lose their jobs. The“common
people" have to dig deep into their
pockets for higher gas prices and
heating oil prices.

While the rich may not see a

Christmas bonus. they can still,

afford to live in Greenwich and
drive their Mercedes. After all,

how much would'they really care if
gas cosLs si'lzo or $1.50? A war,
however, would eventually lower
oil prices and take some burden off
the working class.

The reality is harsh. War or
peace, the “common people” have
much to lose. They can either send
their children to fight and die, or
they can possibly get pink slips. I
am not advocating either for peace
or war, But I am urging my
politically enlightened fellow
Grinncllians to stop their senseless
chantingandpresentthcrealpicture,
and let the people decide whether
they want body bags or economic
hardship ,

Graffiti is Sign of
Disrespect for Campus

To the editor,

As evidenced by the letter
which appeared on the post office
door, we know that many students
on campus agree with us and do
notsupportthe useofchalk gtaffiti
all over campus as a way of
getting a message across. We take
pride in our campus. which is
generallyclean.quietandpeaceful.
and we feel that it is highly
disrespectful for any group to
deprive us of this simple pleasure.
We are aware that the response to
this letter will likely be that war is
not clean quiet, or peaceful, and
that in order to get and maintain

people's attention, the argument
must be presented in a dramatic
way. Why not catch our attention
by bombarding us with signs at
every turn during our daily
routines—in the dining halls, on
dorm doors,in bathroom stalls'.7 We
couldn’t help but take note,

We supported the letter~writing
campaigns and the initiative vote
condemning our action in the
Persian Gulf; the America's aeti-
\litiestherearefarfrombeingoulof
sight,outdfmind.Plcasegivecredit
and respect where they are due.

Signs Wrong About Harvey Milk‘s Death

To the editor,

I am writing to express my
concern at the signs that recently
appeared on campus claiming that
the late San Francisco Supen'isor
Harvey Milk was killed because he
was gay, That is 2i false and
unfortunate assertion.

Harvey Milkwas killed because
he was in the wrong place in thc

wrong time. Specifically. he was
in the ofﬁce of Mayor George
Moscone. who was the actual
target of assassin Dan White, a
distraught and deranged former
supervisor. Mr. Milkdied,litemlly,
because he was in the way of a
man with a grudge against the
mayor. The fact that the killing
occurred in Mayor Moscone’s
ofﬁce, rather than Mr. Milk's,

clearly supports this fact and
repudiates the alarmist rhetoric that
appeared on the signs.

To claim that Mr. Milk was
killed due to his sexual orientation
demeans his standing, gay or
otherwise, as a dynamic and
courageous role model for
everyone.
