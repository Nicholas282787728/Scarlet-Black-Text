ll“ iti idlaly, April IlZ, 199%

on international Diversity Week in
the last issue of the 8&B. I wonder
why it was naturally assumed that
the events of International Week
were being planned by the Interna—
tional Student Organization All the
events are being sponsored by the
International Week Committee of
the Office of International Student
services and are not being done in
conjunction with 130.

When we sent in the names of
the movies for International Movie
\X/eek, we did not expect them to
bear the title “150 fest;" even the
article said that ISO was holding all
events, while in fact we had men—
tioned that they were not doing so.

Whatiamgettingaristheiarger
tendencythatpeoplehavetobelieve
the preposterous notion that all In—
ternational students are “those ISO
people" and that any international
event is simply an "150 tiring." The
International Week Committee has
wotked very hard to bring the events
ofthis week to you andI ask that they
be duly recognized {or it,

Sexual Assault Awareness
To the campus community:

Sexual assault is a verbal and/or
physical act which breaks a person’s
trust and/or safety and is sexual in
nature The term “sexual assault"
includes the following: tape. incest,
child sexual assault. acquaintance/
dale tape, marital rape, sexual ha—
rassment, exposure, and voyeurism.
Sexual assaults arc acts of violence
where sex is used as a weapon. Vic—
tims/siitvivors of sexual assaults are
forced, coerced, and/or manipulated
to p’lrtlcipnie in unwanted sexual
activity. victim/survivors do not
cause their assaults and are not to
blame.

Sexual assault is a devastating
crime that directs everyone, whether
you are a victim/survivor or are a
friend or ramily member. significant
other, neighbor, or coworker or a
\‘iCIH‘ﬂ/SUIVIVOL It is also a crime
that is increasing at an alarming rate,
National studies have shown that I
out of 5 American women has been
raped (American Medical Assocta—
tion, 1995), Also. 1 in 4 girls and 1
in 7 boys wi 11 he assaulted by the time
they are 18 years old. Rape in Amer—
ica, a private 1992 study which was
endorsed by the Senate ludiciary
Committee, estimated that 683,000
women are raped each year This
works out to 1.3 rapes a minute.

uiirortiiiiately, sexual assault is
a reality, especially wliile in college,
According to ilie Iowa Department
or sarety unitorin crime Reports,
17.21 ycat oltls were most often no
unis or a (oreible tape in 1994. A
1990 FBI study indicates that 1 in 6

women will be rapetl or assaulted
during college. According to a 1985
study by Dr. Mary l<nss, almost 85%
ofvicrimswereacquaintedwirhtheir
assailant. Also, according to that
study, 75% of the men and 55% of
the women involved in aquaintancc
rapes had been drinking or [liking
drugs prior to the assaulL (Some
studies have indicated that alcohol is
involved in as many as 90% of the
incidents of acquaintance tape on
campus.) Alcohol does blur the pic—
ture in sexual interactions, but it is
important to keep the followmg in
mind: It is not a crime to Communi—
cete inerrectively. it is a crime to
perform a sexual act without some-
one’s consent. It is the responsibility
of the aggressor to be sure of that
consent. Alcohol or drugs do not
excuse a person from using his or her
powerandcontroltosexually assault

BY BRUCE FRIEDRICH

Ourtopic this week is Iraq. That
doesn't really narrow it that much,
though, does it? 1 could rant about
how the US supported Saddam Hus-
sein right up to the moment ofbomb—
ing during the gulf war. I could talk
about Ramsey Clark's awesome book,
The Fire This Time, which docu—
mentsUSduplicityininstiganngthe
war and us war crimes during the
official war, in which US troops mas—
sacred over 125.000 c1v11izins and
150,000 soldiers in43 daysofcombar

mostly by friendly fire). If the US
were to lose an equal proportion of
our population, we would have to
lose over 5 million people. imagine.
Ofcourse, the US has never been on
the receiving end oran air raid, so we
can't really imagine the terror we
wreaked on the people oflraq during
this war.

I could talk about the depleted
titanium tipped bullets which the
us rained down on the population
of Iraq, and how our troops may be
getting siclt as a result orexposure to
all this nuclear waste. 1 could talk
abouthowUSsoldietshadnewdrugs
tested on them, and the illnesses that
these drugs may be causing. i could
talk about how a world tribunal onZ
judges from 18 nations found the us
guiltyori9dirrerentwatcrimeswirh
respect to the massacre. I could talk
about how Bill Clinton bombed Iraq
in June 1993 ”to affirm the expecta—
tion oiciviiised behavior among na-
tions." This was in response to an
entirely unsubstantiated threat
against former President Bush.

But the most egregious of Mid.

The idea of the sanctions is to
punish Saddam Hussein, but no evi—
dence exists that he is feeling any
pain at all. However, “water and San—
itation systems have deteriorated,
hospitals are functioning at 40% of
capacity, and the population is large—

which provide 1,000 caloriesperpet—
son per day,” according to a recent
UN report. 1,000 calories are con—
tained in 3 peanut butter and jelly
sandwiches or 4 cans of beer.

Before the war. 75% of Iraq’s
caloric intake was imported, over
$500 million in medicine and medi—
cal equipment was imported each
year. imagine having a filling insert—

froin diarrhea and other easily pre—

570,000 children have died fromthe
sanctions alone, and more are dying
daily.

“There is one crime against hu—
manity in this last decade of the
millennium that exceeds all others,”
according to former US Attorney
GenetalRamsey Clark, “It is the US—
forced sanctions against the people
of Iraq. The whole population has
suffered. More than one million Ira—
qis have died, mostly among the eld-
