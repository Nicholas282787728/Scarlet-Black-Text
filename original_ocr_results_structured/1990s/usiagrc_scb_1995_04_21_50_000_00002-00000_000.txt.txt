posals on the ballot are:
#1 - Support of Student Diversity
The students of Grinnell Col-
lege are in favor of a truly diverse
campus. The idea conveyed in this

ance, but tnie acceptance of all cul-
tures, religions, sexual orientations,
and ethnic backgrounds. in this ac-

the Grinnell College community —
be they students, faculty, or adminis

tration 7 should do everything in
her/his power to make Grinnell
College’s campus safe for the ex-
pression of diverse thoughts and di-
verse cultures.

We as Grinnell College students
are also in favor ofthe respect inher-
ent in a diverse campus, We should
respect not only individual differ-
ences, but similarities between indie
Viduals as members of the largest
race on Earth — The Human Race.

include a diversity of viewpoints and
ideas which have been historically
deleted from coursework. There—
fore. we challenge the faculty to die
versify the existing curriculum by no
longcrexeludingthccontributtonsof
different minority peoples. Further
more, we challenge our classmates
~ the students of Grinnell College,
to help ensure that this diversiﬁca-
tion of curriculum takes place by
asking questions, offering knowl-
edge, and challenging the status quo.
#3 - Airican»American Studies
Concentration

The students of Grinnell Cola
lege support the idea of having an
introductory course in Africanr

American Studies. Thecollege made
a commitment twenty years ago to
this concentration. and the students
feel that it is time for the college to
live up to its promise. We also prOr
pose that the administration find a
qualiﬁed professor from outside of
the college because: 1)Nonc of the
professors here are qualiﬁed to teach
this course and most of them do riot
sltow any interest in becoming quali-
fied, and 2) the burden of teaching
this course should not fall on the
Black professors who are already
employed by thecoltege becausethey
are already overworked and they are
always looked at to educate the cam-
pus on issues relating to the Black

community. We want the admini5r
tralion to offer this course within the
next two years.

We, the students of Grinnell
College, do hereby declare that

Week 3 in the six-week Grinnell
College Dining Services ineal
rotation be served an additional
timcinthcsichek rotation. The
meal, Chicken Patty Parmesan,
is currently served only once ev-

butwe still have thefts," Peterson
noted.

Every year the college has a
problem with theft, particularly
around the beginning and end of
the year, she said, when “stu-
dents are moving out and in and
there's 2t lot of stuff around.“

Regarding the crime rate in
Grinnell, Sergeant Lawrence
Bush said that the town has also
“had a rash of thefts" in the last
few weeks andthat‘severalbusb
nesses in town have been hit by
forced entry." In all ofthe thefts,
the only thing taken was cash.
There was also a breakrin to the
College Bookstore, but nothing
was taken.

Though the police have no
specific statistics on the number
of crimes reported from the col-
lege, Peterson said that. “If we’re
having a problem, it makes sense
that [the criminals] are hitting
the college too."

Much of the theft at the Cole
lcge is preventable, according to
the police, if students lock their
room doors. As Bush said, “Ba-
sically, your room is your house.
You’d lock your house, you
should lock your room, too, If
you lockyourdoor. the only other
way in is by forced entry, and in
a dorm, forced entry will tend to
be noticed.” Peterson also aid»

vised students to “talk to the
people on your floor" and let them
know that you don’t want people
entering your tooth without you
around.

Bush recommends that students
“be accountable for their property”
instead of leaving it sitting in hallr
ways or in study cartels at the library.
If you have to leave your bag or
purse, make sure someone is watch»
ing it, he said. Other precautions
against loss of personal property inc
clude locking and registering bikes.
locking purses ll'l lockers at the rec
(most stolen purses on campus are
“usually stolen at the PEC,“ accord

ing to Peterson), and not keeping
large amounts of money or valuable
items in your room.

College students have specu-
lated aboutwhat group ofpeople
7 prospective students, town
residents and. though less fre—
quently speculated upon, fellow
students 7the thieves may bee
long to. But do the police par-
ticularly suspect members ofone
of these groups over another?
“Not at this time we don't. I
guess I’d have to say we suspect
all three when we know so
little, it‘s hard to choose one
group,” said Peterson.
