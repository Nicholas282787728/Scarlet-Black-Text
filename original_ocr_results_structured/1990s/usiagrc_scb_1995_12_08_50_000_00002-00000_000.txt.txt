Dorr says that a common path
for percussion students is that “pea
ple do group lessonsand then they go
in and do private lessons after a se—
mester or two... specializing on an
instrument.” The Drum Circle is a
weekly meeting of students from var»
ious group lessons, who get together
“for fun,” Dorr says, to see what it’s
like .to intemct with several other
rhythms.

For “a more traditional western
European music ensemble," there is
Grimell’s PercussionEnsemble, Dorr
says, ”That is a more formalized
ensemble where people read music
that’s been composed or arranged
specifically for percussion... Every
measure changes music.”

In 1990, Don says, “there were
five students studying percussion,"
all in the format of private leSSDIB.
“The Drum Circle and the Percus—
sion Ensemble grew out ofstudenrs
wanting to have an outlet for that
type orperrorrnnnce," Dorrstiys, The
number of students studying percus—
sion with Dorr has risen to about 70,

The Last Seduction

This is not a good movie. it is
the story ofa cunning evil woman
and lots orsurpnsirigly stupid men.
She manipulates them all, and they
all fall for her schemes, and she goes
unpunished. For example, there is a
scene where the woman has be cap.
tured by a private eye and is being
escorted back to her husband. The
P.I. is black and she says “hey, is it
tme what I hear about black men?
Come on show ,
me what you got."

The man, forwho
knows what rea-
son,sztys“ok" He
unbuckles his
safetybeltandshe
proceeds to drive
into a telephone
pole, killing him.
Whatever. If you
have really nar—
row stereotypes
about men’s be» ’
haVior and you
wishtohavethem
reinforced, watch
this film. Otherwise stay away.

Counterpoint (Mateo) I didn’t
watch this movre, so I'll take this
time to explain why there are only
two movie reviews. The other two
movies, Dew] in a Blue Dress and
Savage Nights, were not rentable,
and since we refuse to ask in any
help from the Philmz Selexeun Ko—
mitec, a la the men from The Last
Seduction , wewill not reView them.
They were probably awful movies
anyway. Oh, by the way, I loved
The Last Seduction. It was a river-
ing story about an assertive woman
who refuses to be limited and op«
pressed by a male (lomlnatetl soci—
cty. She proves that, contrary to

nizing a "llmntrC/mulH/disClplinﬂry
project” for January 26, This will be
an opportunity for Heiland to mime
duce improvisational dance to Grin—
hell. “I don't think students here at
Grinnellare used to totally improvis<
Ingm. I want people just to see what
this is abautithls kind of process
where we just crcntesonietliingspon.
taneously.” Heiland says that the
performance in“ offer an opportunb
ty for people to either dance, create
the stage set, or perform music, all of
which will be iinproVisetl. The piece
to be created Will center around the
theme “Telling Mother,”specifically
“things you never told your mom7
we‘re just going to play off of that
idea."

Heiland is also a co-director of
SAI, a New York—based performance

My Family

Oh my, this nioyie was really
boring. Despite a brief, but amusing
knife fight where, at a prom, a prom—
attire clad girl, pulls a switchblode
out of her hair and throws it to her
embattled boyfriend who proceeds
to skewer another man not in prom

Counterpoint (Taylor) Well I
agree with Mateo for the most part.
This film which seemed to harbour
aspirations of grandeur and a hope
for profound meaning, fell short of
both. It was a simple story with little
aCllODi Chueho (7) was an interest—
ing character and he was killed by
the police for killing another man.
Then because there wcre no other
interesting Characters, Jiininy grew
up and became like Clincho. He
didn‘tdie, but I didn't really care. All
the kids grow up and the parents,
now old and gray, say to themselves
“We had a good life, didn't we? Yes.
we did." Then the film ends and we
are supposed to have gained some»
thing from their story I didn't.
