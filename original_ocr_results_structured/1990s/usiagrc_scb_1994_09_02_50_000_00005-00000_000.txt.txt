Violoncello and harpsichord, that has
been termed “scintillating".
“virtuosic", and “authentic baroque
performance at its best” by some of
this country‘s most respwed music
critics. Elizabeth Hays, Associate
Music Professor, called the group
“world class artists,”

According to Hays, Sunday’s
French Baroque concert presents in—
strumental solo and chamber music
written forthe purpose ofezttenaining
monarchs Louis XIV (r. 16431715)
and Louis XV (1'. 1715-1774), their
extensive families, and their counsr

Hays says funher, ”The concert
opens with a landmark chamber so-
nata by Francois Couperin. Subtitled
“La Steinquerque," this music cers
emoniously commemorates Louis
XIV‘s victory there in 1692, and is
replete with fanfares and other mar-
tial sounds.

"At the center of the program
willbeachambersuiteofcourtdances
written by the elder master of viol
playing, Marin Marais. Included are
some dances with rustic strains res
ﬂective of Mamis‘ background By
comparison, an Italiante cello sonata
by I. Bodin de Boismortier repre
sents the newer style, Also played

guys for lunch or

'30 PM M-F;

will be a short suite of viol pieces by
Antoine Forqueray presented not on
viols but on solo harpsichord by
Arthur Haas, specialist in French
harpsichord music.

”The program closes with a de-
scriptive suite of dances from
Rameau's ballet—opera “Les Indes
galantes" (1735). In this genre, dance
andspectacle were featured morethan
plot,which consists hereof fouramos
rous tales set in“magical" lands (Tur-
key,Peru, Persia, nndaNorth Ameri-
can forestl) Among the usual court
dances are found some whichattempt
todescn'be wan'iors,slaves,artdother
inhabitants of such exotic places.”

The Aulos Ensemble has experi-
enced much international success
with extensive tours, recordings and
radio broadcasts, and for the past
eight seasons has presented its own
concert series which featured some
of the foremost artists in the ﬁeld in
collaboration with the Ensemble. In
recent seasons, Aulos' core group of
five musicians (of which four will be
appearing at Grinnell) has been en~
larged to become a small chamber
orchestra, performing and recording
the larger»scale concerti, suites and
sinfonias of Bach and Vivaldi.

plot could hit very close to home
with most of the Grinnell College
campus, RealinBite: is billed asa
“fresh, irrellevantcomedy for post-
baby boomers about life and love".
The ﬁlm opens with the college
graduation of a small group of
friends. They are twenty-some-
thing members of the mythical
“Generation X", characterized by
adult society as lazy and
directionlcssr The friends are por-
trayed as they ﬁnally face the hard
facts about the real world and life
after college. Viewers are given a
comical glimpse of the various love
lives and shOrch'n jobs of the
group, but in the end, it's found
that reality really does biter

Four Weddings and

a Funeral

Friday a! 7:30 p.m.,‘ Sunday at
3 500 p.m., Harris Center

Recommended to all by Lisa
Alexander,SGAFilmsChair,Faur
Wedding: and a Funeral is 3 “hi-
larious" romantic comedy about a
man and a woman who fall in love
when they meet at the various
events in the movie‘s title. The
relationship of the American
womanandEnglishmanprogresses
through each of these meetings.
This British ﬁlm is in the same
class as last year’s Sleepless in
Seattle, and promoted as a “fresh
twist on modem love“. Thismovie
is especiallyrecommended to those
Grinnell studens who are not in a
committed relationship.

Batman: M ask of the

Phantom:

Saturday, 7:30 p.m..
Harris Center

Batman is back, but this time
it’s for his first full-length ani»
mated feature film. This time, he
faces his most difﬁcult battle, one
against the super criminal, the
Phantasm. This is an allsnew story
about Batman’s tragic past, and is
an “exciting, dark look ofthe T.V.
show”. This movie is entenaining
and full of action, and a cameo
appcrance by Batman’s real nem~
esis, the Joker, provides the audi-
ence with some big laughs.
