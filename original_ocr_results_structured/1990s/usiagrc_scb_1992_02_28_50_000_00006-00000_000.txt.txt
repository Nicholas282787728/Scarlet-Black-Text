Proteus takes on
participatory theatre

By Alice Ostdiek

Can you say “par-uc-ipa-tory the-
atre7"Well,themembersofGlinnell's
improvisational acting group Proteus
sure can, Coming soon to this small
town in Iowa is a project the likes of
which has never been seen before.
According to student director of the
project, Todd Erler, it is“the future of
theater in America.”

The deﬁnition of participatory the-
ater is something like this: “well,
it’s. . .uh, something where the actors
andtheaudienceinteractcompletely.”
Michelle Holcomb commented,
“Hey! This is a lot of fun, guys!” and
Jim Kropa has on many occasrons
said, “It’s almost like Virtual Real-
lty.”

The players have been working
since the beginning of this semester
to try to put together something en-
tirely new and different. They
struggled with how to remain true to
the candid spirit of improv while
moving on to something original and
innovative.

So. while this production relies
completely on the players’ skills as
improvers, it gives them the freedom
to use fully developed characters with
complex relationships to one another.
It‘s not going to be the slick comedy
stuff people have begun to expect
from the troupe. Instead, it’s some-
thing bigger and better. It is some-
thing manyofthem havebeen dream-
ing of since theyjoined Proteus.

The group’s plan from now on is
to devote its time to the development
of “projects" proposed by a student
director which can range from simply
“playing games" to something as in»
tricate and elaborate as this project,
“The Opening," which will be per-
formed on Friday. March 6and Saturn
day, March 7 at 8 pm. at the Jeanne
Burkie Women’s Center in town.

Tickets will be available at the
Fine Arts Office which has limited
office hours. Only thirty audience
members will be able toparticipate in
each performance. so get your tickets
early. They will be available as of
Friday, Febmary 28.

I Never Promised You a Rose Garden

An excellent drama about the terror of schizophrenia. I Never Promised You a Rose Garden is almmost, but
not quite, the female version of One Flew Over the Cuckoo‘s Nest. This movie will be shown on Friday at
9:00 pm. in North Lounge.

Jesus ofMontreal

An actor hired to put on the Passion play updates the production to make it relevant to the present day.
Although the classic social satire becomes a hit. it is criticized by the church, trivializcd by the media and
commercialized by theestablishment. As the aura around the play intensifies, the actors are drawn out oftheir
realities into real life portrayals of their stage roles, complicating matters in a most unexpected way. This
developing cult film is "a hip allegory that reaffirms the ideals ofspirituality, friendship and art with wit and
grace." Jesus owattreal, cosponsored by the Performing Arts Committee and the office of the chaplain,
will be shown on Wednesday at 9:30 pm. in North Lounge.

0n the Waterfront

This is the firsl movie i fell in love with and also the first I ever saw on a VCR. Back in 1980, when a VCR
looked more like a refrigerator. and my gmndmolher was the only one I knew that had one, I watched this
movie ten times (at least). This break, after not seeing it for eleven years, it still moved me. Marlon Brando
stars. doing what he does best,rebelling. Oneofthc greatestacting performances ofall time, Oh the Waterfront

Kurosawa's Ran shows Sunday

By Laura Moran

Willi a ﬁlm repertoire stretching
over half a century and numbering
thirty films,including The Seven
Samuri (1954), Throne of Blood
(1957),andDreams(l990),Japanesc
director Akira Kurosawa is recog-
nized internationally as one of the
greatest living figures of the cinema
world.

Kurosawa‘s l985 masterpieceRan
is loosely based on William
Shakespeare’s play ”King Lear,”set

against the backdrop of the Sengoku
Jidai peroid in medieval Japan, In
researching Japanese history,
Kurosawa became fascinated with
the tale ofa war lord who was lucky
enough to have three excellent sons;
what would have happened, he won
dered, if instead all three sons had
been bad'.7

The word “ran” means “Chaos,"
and Kurosawa creates a chaotic, hellr
like world where brutal violence ex-
plodes continually and no Lrustexists.

This resurgent bleakness is preva-

lent in all of Kurosawa‘s post-World
War II work, which is fascinating
when taken in the historical context
ofJapan asvictim ofthedesolationof
the atom bomb.

This movie holds appeal fora wide
range of audiences, from the
Shakespearean enthusiast to the his-
tory buff to critics of modern society.
and Kurosawa's distinctive directing
style and relevantsocial commentary
are not to be missed.

Rah will be shown Sunday at
9:00pm. in North Lounge.

Grinnell Singers face musical challenge

By Tom Meglioranza

The Grinncll Singers are facing
their mostchallenging semester cvcr.
Ask any singer why, and they will
answer with one simple word:
“Spem!"

Spem in aliutn is a motel written
inthe1500'sbyTh0masTallisfor40
singers. Since the Grinnell Singers
number about40. the group is broken
down into eight S-voice choirs in
whichenchperson hastlleirownindi-
vidual line.

“It is an extremely risky venture."

says directorJohn Stuhr~Rommereim,
“becausc one individual can easily
spoil the whole performance. The
Singers seem to be rising to the chal-
lenge."

The singers seem a little nervous,
but are mostly excited about singing
this mammoth work in which each of
them has a solo. “It’s still sounds
pretty rough around the edges at this
point," said one singer, “but it’s been
coming together, and sometimes it
sounds just gorgeous."

The singers are currently rehears-
ing Spem individually, in small

groups, and as the full eight—choir
wall of sound.

Hopefully, after a few more rcr
hearsals, hearing the interplay of 40
individualvoiceseachsingingabeaw
tifully crafted line will be, as Stuhrr
Rommereim put it, “a cosmic expcrir
cncc,”

The singers are also busy prepar-
ing works by Sviridov, Poulenc,
Faurc, and Monteverdi to name a
few. Their annual tour during the ﬁrst
week of spring break will take them
through the midwest, including Kane
sas City, St. Louis, and Omaha.
