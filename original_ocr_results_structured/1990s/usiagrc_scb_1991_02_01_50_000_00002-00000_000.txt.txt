marching contingent was reported
to have extended for five miles.

The range of political beliefs at
the march varied from those who
oppose the current militztry action
in the Middle East but support the
Lroops stationed there to those af-
filiated with more radical fringe
groups.

Whtlc PGA opposes the current
use of force in the Persian Gulf it
has noofficialpositlononthe troops
fighting there, although it seems
that the genreal consensus is sup
port for the troops.

Susan Cox. a coordinating
member ofPGA said that the main
purpose of the group is to give
those people who zire unhappy with
someaspcctofthcwziranoutieifor
discussion and protest.

With the outbreak of war in the
Gulf, Cox has not lost hope for a
peaceful scLllementof the conflict.
However, Spears acknowledges that
the United States is not going to
"pull out just like that. That's not
realistic.”

In addition Cox noted some
frustration with the media coverage
of the protest in the capital and
other areas.

Peace Day Change due
to problems with relays

By Tom Zlubingcr

The date of this year‘s Peace
Day has been changed from the
fourth Saturday in April to the
secondSziturdayinSeptember,soit
will not be seen as a substitute for
the Relays.

Last semester, the Peace Day
Committec(PDC),chairedby Nora
Bloch, felt that students would also
be more involved and participate
more if Peace Day was at the be»
ginning of the academic year in-
stead of at the end.

Bloch stated that she felt thttt
lzist year's Peace Day encompassed

too many issues and thatihis year’s _

should be brought down to at more
regional level.

AS a resulL, more will be fewer
big national names speaking ﬂl
Peachayandtherewillbealarger
focus on issues in Iowa and the
Midwest,

But, due to the developments in
the Persian Gulf, PDC thought that
the issue of the Persian Gulf War
should be addressed sooner than
September.

created committee. This commit—
tcc, consisting of some PDC
members and some Persian Gulf
Alert members. will plan what
Bloch called a “mini-Peace Day."
This will take place on April 20th
and will specifically address the
issue of the war.

The aim of this “mini-Peace
Day" is to help educate students
and raise greater campus awarcr
nessaboutthewur. Bloch feelstl-tal
the issues concerning the war are
complex and have not been ad-
dressed by the media,

“These issues need to be CXV
plained," said Bloch.

The exact name of this day has
notyet been decided, and the day’s
program is still in the planning
stages.
