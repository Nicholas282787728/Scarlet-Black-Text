or Dance Troupe

By Denice Skelly

The curtain fell, followed by a
dent hush throughout the theater.
.uddenly there was thunderous
pplause. What pcrformance cone
’ns all the elements of ﬁnesse,
race, agility, coordinau'on, athletic
bility and beauty’.] Dance. Danc-
rs have captivated audiences and
apturcd their imaginations for
enturies, just as the DanceTroupe
asdone [or many years at Grinnell

ollege.

This week, the Dance Troupe
as begun to rehearse with six rer
uming dancers, seven new mem»
rcrs and enthusiasm to experience

hatever the new year may hold in
.tore for the dancers.
The troupe focuses on modem
1 nce, and is directed by 3.0.
oertman. assistant dance profesv
or. Voertman, who has directed
e troupe for the past 20 years,
never tires of troupe” because it is
onstantJy changing and challenge
ng her.

“Each dancer contributes new
: d unique ideas every year," said

ocnrnan.

Dance Troupe originated at
rinnell as a club consisting of a
eekly practice. Through the years,
itll the loyal dedication and com-
itunentof the dancers and Voert—
an, it has become comparable to a

name company which mees four
naysa week. The dancers present a
.pring production as Well as an in-
orrnal fall production,

The dancers choreograph their

and yet is tt discipline and an art
form with its own unique quallr
ties."

“Dance troupe is a tight group
that is special,“ said Heather May,
one of the returning dancers. “For
me,itwasreallybeneflciallastyear.
It gave me a sense ofgood feeling.
The most exciting thing was cho-
reographing a piece and watching
other peoples’ bodies performwhat
I had already created and pictured
mentally."

Michelle Hampton, in her fourth
year of Dance Troupe, remarked
thatthe rroupeon a whole is getting
stronger. Auditions went well this
year, with a variety of abilities from
the applicants. However, the troupe
mustbeselectiveto maintainahigh
level of quality. Hampton feels that
the Small group creates many op
portunities.

“One of the beautiesof this group
[is that] we are selective, or we
would be limited in abilities,” she
said.

Overall, anticipation hangs in
the air as the dancers predict yet
another succusful dancing season
fortlletroupe. Rehearsing forhouls,
often when tired and sweaty, dedi-
cation, a sense of unity, and deter-
mination produces those magical
moments that we, as the audience,
witness when the cunain rises. The
audience will continue to follow
Dance Troupe because of the repu-
tation of the well-rehearsed, well-
designcd, polished and varied pro-
gram thathas preceaded the troupe.

Runs Special Effects for Hamlet

By Jennifer Manes

The Theater Department offers
a useful class for those interested in
the set design aspects of stage pron
ductlon. Introduction to Stagccrnft
is taught by Associate Professor of
Theatcrlarnes Taylor. His students
work within the traditional medlr
urns of expression, such as paint-
ing, drawing and Sculpture, to cre-
ate visual images for the stage.

The lighting and set design for
the November stage production of
Hamlet, conceived and overseen
by Taylor, will reﬂect their cf forts.
About $5,000 of the $17,000 col-
lege production budget will go to-
wards the costumes and staging for
Hamlet.

lnaclass lectureTaylor emphar
sized that set design is far from an
individual artistic endeavor.

“It's a collective process,” said
Taylor. He said theater produc-
tions in general are difficult to
mount, since so many people with
different ideas and objectives are
involved.

“It‘s amazing we can get a pro-
duction up at all because so much
can go wrong."

Students in Taylor‘s class com-
prise Hamlet’s stage crew. They
put in six hours per week of lab
time, during which they manually
construct sets and props under
Taylor’s direction. A student run-
ning-crew is also in charge of stage
lighting and sound during performr
ances. The actual set construction

for Hamlet, still in the planning
stages, won't begin until Oct. 1,

Meanwhile the students have
been practicing. They recently
constructed a collection of objects
out of wood, styrofoam and metal
hardware in ordcr to familiarize
themselves with the tools and
methods of set construction.

Brandan McClain, a sophomore
in the class, has extensive prior
experience in set design. He acted
and did sct construction fora semi-
profcssional theater during the past
Lllrccsummersand hewasincharge
of set desrgn for highschool pro»
ductions. But he said that such
design background is not required
for Taylor's class.

Sophomores Maria McCarthy
and Bridget Wilcox, the stage
managers for Hamlet, are also in
Taylor's class. They attend all re-

‘INEIEAWWL

hearsals and coordinate the cffons
of crew and cast.

“We pull everything together.
We’ to the organizational glue," said
Wilcox. “Ididn’twantthc stress of
acting in the play.“ She chose to be
morcrnvolved in the organizational
aspects of the production.

McCarthy prefers these Chores
to acting because she enjoys the
responsibilties of stage managing.

“Yeah. you get to boss people
around," said Wilcox. She added
thatstagccraftisrewardlng because
“you produce something tangible.
It's like, This is what I’ve done,
this is what I‘ve contributed.m

Wilcox predicts thatlheset, still
in preliminary stages of concepr
tion, will be big and "very stately,”
although probably not as complex
as that in last year'scollege produc»
tion of Dracula.
