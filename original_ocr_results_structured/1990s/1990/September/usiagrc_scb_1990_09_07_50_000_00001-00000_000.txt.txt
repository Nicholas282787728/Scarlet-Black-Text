Committee
Approaches
Screening Stage

By Jessica Weisol

According to Charles J epsen, the
Presidential Search Committee is
near the end of the ﬁrst stage in its
attempt to find a successor to
Grinnell College President George
Drake. J epsen told the faculty atnn
Aug. 29 meeting that none of the
applicants has an “inside track."
and at least ten of the them have
“outstanding credentials."

The Search Committee held in
most recent meeting this past
Wednesday todiscuss recent
progress, However, Pedro
FernandezeMcCarthy,acommittee
member, declined to comment af-
ter the meeting was held,

Applications for the job will be
accepted until the suggested dead-
line of September 151 After that
date, a process of screening appli-
cants will begin.

Before the faculty meeting, 119
applications had been received, 63
of which were from conﬁrmed
candidates. Jepsen also said that at
least 20 applications had been re4
ceived from women and nine ap
plicants were identiﬁable as mi<
norities. The number of applicants
is increasing as the deadline ap»
proaches.

Jcpsen also explained that the
committeehasretainedtheservices
of an organization to assist in the
screening process. This company
was involved in drafting a six-page
job description, setting upa system
for the reading process and in cre-

atingaresourcelistfornominations.
This group will also conduct back-
ground searches of applicants and
will coordinate interviews.

The committee will begin the
reading process by dividing the
applications. According to Jepsen,
each committee member will read
oneethirdoftheapplicntions. Ailer
the pool is narrowed, two more
readings will be conducted until
each member has read all of the
surviving applications.

“I’m quite satisfied with the
search,”saidJepsen. He alsopraised
trustee Robert Burnett, the Search
Committee chair, and said that there
had been “remarkable agreement”
between the faculty committee

Parking Policy Frustrates Student Car Owners

By Josh Ford

Grinnell has began toenforce its
new and widely unpopular student
vehicle parking procedures, which
included permit fees of $65 and
$20. The policy, approved by
Grinneil College President George
Drake,waspartofaproposal by the
parking committee which met

through much of last and year and
submitted the plan at the end of last
semester. SGA President Pedro
Femandez-McCarthy, in an all~
campus mailing declared himself
“strictly opposed to the new sys-
tem," and held an open fomm on
the same day the policy went into
effect,

The thrust of the opposition to

the policy is focused on the $65
gray permits which entitleastudent
to park in any student spot and the
$20 red permits which allow park-
ing only in “perimeter lots."
Femandez-McCarthy feels the
prices are unnecessary and said he
would have preferred 2510 ﬂat fee.

Ofﬁce of Special Services and

Summer Activities, said the prices
were decided upon in panto pay for
the student ticketers enforcing the
policy, maintenance of the parking
lots, as well as a method of encour-
aging students to use the exterior
lots for long term parking.
Femandez-McCarthy felt that
the funds for maintenance should
have come out of the Physical
Plant’s budget, stating it was not
“modusoperandiatGrinnelltohave
select students pay for the mainte-
nance of a particular facility."
Many students also oppose the
pennitfees,declaringthattheycre-
ate an unnecessary distinction be-
tween students who can afford a
gray parking permit and those who
cannotpay fcra$65 partcingspace.
The analorv most often heard is

that paying more money does not
guarantee a better dorm room, so
why should it provide a better park»
ing space?

Mr. Work said the committee
was aware of the unavoidable dis»
tinctions created by the policy. He
added, that in drawing up the new
policy, it was suggested that ad»
vantages be given to uppetclass-
men in obtaining choice parking
spots,muchlike the considerations
given in selection of dorm rooms.
This he said was rejected because
of a desire not to, “reinforce that
distinction (txeference to upper»
classmen) more than (is) neces-
