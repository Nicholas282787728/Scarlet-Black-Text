GORBACHEV: Westerners
Should Be Wary of Russian
Leader and Reforms

continued from page 7

as Gorbachev does everything he
can to reverse Lithuania's nascent
independenoewithouttamishinghis
reputation, a rather different image
of the Soviet leader prevails in the
minds of Lithuanian citizens. One
of the few sober views of Gorbachev
and his ambitions comes from two
joumalistsnamedEvansandNovak,
who travelled to Vilnius in the
winter and met with Bronius
Genzelis. a member of the new
Russian parliament. Genzelis told
them frankly that “the Western
image that Gorbachev is a democrat
is not correct." They were also
informedby membersofthesajudis
independence movementthatthere
are roughly 20,000 KGB agents in
the little state. Said one Sajutlis
affiliate of Gorbachev, “We do not
love him as you do."
Gorbachev‘s actions in
Lithuania are not unprecedented.
The man of the decade also used
force to quell demonstrations in the
provinces of Armenia, Azerbaijan,
and Georgia. He has keptover half-
a-rniliion Russian soldiers stationed
throughout eastern Europe,
according to journalist Charles
Reese. Since he took office, one
study found, he has not curtailed
military spending buthas increased
it by five percent yearly. Yet he
continues to be lauded as a
peacemaker, as the audacious
innovator of Perestroika.
Pcrestroika notwithstanding, there
remain many thousands of Soviet
warheadsaimed at this country. As
a speech to Russian students last
fall revealed, Gorbachev is still
committed to a “true socialism"

which, magically perhaps, will not
result in more of the atrocities and
repression that make up the
doctrine’s history.

The fall of the Berlin Wall and
various concessions—free travel,
free speech, etc—are appreciable
However. we must not become
intoxicated. as the media has, by
the prospect of thawed East-West
relations. Back in the 19305, a
SovietadministtalornamcdDimitry
Manuilsky delivered a speech
containingthefollowingstatement.
“To win, we shall need the element
of surprise. The bourgeoisie will
have to be put to sleep. So we shall
begin by launching the most
spectacular peace movement on
record. There will be electrifying
overtures and unheard-of
consessions. The capitalist
countries, stupid anddecadent, will
rejoice to cooperate in their own
destruction. They will leap at
another chance to be friends. As
soon as their guard is down, we
shall smash them withourclenched
fist“

This is something to consider,
as we anticipate the much-hyped
peace dividend.

Coverage of the “end of the cold
war" has been almost thoroughly
devoid of the skepticism history
should teach us. Of course we
should work toward the conflict’s
end, but we must also avoid
heralding it prematurely. Thebroad
consensus, reﬂected in and shaped
by the media. is that Russia has
ceased to be a threat. Since her
empire is in turmoil, her hard-line
nationalists no longer have any real
inﬂuence and they could never
resurrect her to imperial power.

These are probably the same
impressions people had about
Germany at the close of World War
One. Nor would a resident of
Lithuania or Azejbaijan be likely to
swallow the notion of a retreating
Soviet threat. The Western public’s
understanding of Gorbachev
derives exclusivly from the insights
of people living outside his sphere
of control.

The media’s latest assault on the
Right is built upon shakey ground.
Even if it were founded on reality,
on an accurate perception of events
overseas, it would not be less
laughable An extensive list of
issues continues to engage
conservative thinkers. Manyofour
inner cities, for instance, resemble
war zones. Marijuana now equals
the corn crop in theyearly net profit
it draws. Public education is a
farce, and in private institutions the
Great Books are decried as racist,
sexist, etc.,by radicals to whomthe
terms “western culture" and
“patriotism" are ajoke. And the list
of problems goes on. In relations
with Russia, we cannot afford to
indulge in wishful thinking. Ifand
when we witness certain
concessions—arms reductionsona
quid pro quo basis with our forces,
freedom and independence for the
Baltic states~il will mean one
fewer crisis, and not, as the media
tells us, the end of American
conservatism. We must make
Gorbachev understand that
precning before the cameras is not
enough. Littlecanbeaccomplished
until we extricate the reality of
Russia under Gorbachev from quick
assumptions.

PROTEUS: Improv
Group Looks for
New Challenges

continued from page 7

“They’re going to try and build
on what I’ve done this year, to
expand the base of operations,“ said
Sparks.

McClain feels that a desire for
charisma, rather than leaders with
greatacdngabiliries,motivatedthe
choice.

“I don‘t think Craig and I are
really good. i guess we tend to be
energetic, tend to have good
attitudes,” said McClain.

McClain is mainly concerned
that Proteus might overlap with
the Harold troupe, a newly
organized campus improv group
doing a more formal sort of
improvisation.

“(The Harold) is far more
developed and intelligent. The
scenes are more of a whole, and the
characters have to be really
consistent." saindClain. “People
inProteus alot of the time juslu'y to
go fora iaug ."

Not that there’s anything wrong
with that.

“it’s a different sort of improv,"
stressed Kathy Henson, one of the

coordinators of .the new Harold

troupe.

Currently about 10 or 11 of the
13 people in the Harold have worked
with Proteus at some time,
according to McClain.

“The relationship between these
two groups is going to be really
weird," said McClain.
