Society Re

«By Benjamin Root

The Society for Creative
Anucllronism (SCA) is keeping
the customs of the Middle Ages
:lli\‘clll Grinncll for“tlnybody who
ever had any kind of an intt'rest in
anything medieval." The group is
parlol‘ the intcrnatiunalmonrproﬁt
organizationot’thesantename,and
was cstabltshcd here more than ten
years ago.

"Trying to recreate the middle
zlges as they could have been“ is
what SCA ts doing, according to
members Erik Brandenburg and
Steve Slillllcrt The group does not
encompass peasants or the plague
like the Middle Ages, and when it
stages btttdes, nobody dies. The
ideals of an age of chivalry are
preserved, according to ‘Sue
Htllman, “where everybody is the
best that they can be, and
everybodyisholdingupthatdrcam

for one another.”

SCA events Include many
activities normally based on a
common theme. For instance, the
event held here on campus last.
weekend centered on the theme of
the quest of King Richard the
Lionhearlcd. Some activities were
archery. dancing, singing, and a
loumnmcnt of simulatodindividual
combat. All these were followed
in the evening by a feast, and a
post-revel.

the group are encouraged to create

insists, “It is Education, and it is
fun."

Members of the group do
acknowledge that there are
differences between the Middle
Agesand thcworld that they create.
They t‘rivc to events in cars, which
they crll “dn gons," and women
fight indie toumnmcnts, but they
simply take these facts along with
the medieval ideals which they
enjoy.

Grinncll SCA is also different
in the respect that it is composed of
collegestudents. Theintemational
group, for the most part, is an
association of older adults. Since

operates out of the college, it
benefits from the facilities of the

college. "Otherpeoplehavctorcntv

places. We can use the college
grounds for our tournaments,”
Shaffersays.

This advantage, however, is
infrequently used by the group.
SCA usually attends events that
occur off campus. Scheduled this
semester is a trip to the Stouthcart
Memorial Toumament in Ankeny
on Apri128,which is in honorot’an
SCA member from Des Moincs
who died six years ago in an auto
accident returning from an SCA
event.

The international SCA
organization began in Berkeley,
California in 1968. Nonrmcmbers
are invited to the group‘s events,
usually at a slightly higher cost
than that of members. The events
occur most weekends at different

places throughout the Midwest.

The group receives a normal
student organization budget that
the costs of holding events
sometimes exceeds. Fees like the
$6 charge for the medieval feast in
Younkerloungelastwcekend help
make up the difference, The feast
was held “in an effort to reach the
entire campus," according to
member John Danos, and was
followed by a tournament on
Saturday. The group was pleased
with the attendance of nearly 100
people from off campus.

SCA was also pleased with the
local turnout to the feast last
weekend which includcd faculty.
students, and town residents.
Meetings for the group are held on
Thursday nights at 8 pm. in the
Forum Coffeehouse, and anyone
interested in the nostalgia of the
middle ages is encouraged to attend.

By Sharyn Obsatz

Your “chance to see the world in
a minute,” according to Mwelu
Ndeti, will occur at the Cultural

scnting cultures from around the
world. She explained that for the
intemzttionalstudents participating,
“Thisis oncnightlhalwccan share
withcverybody alittlebitofhome."

Ndeti hopes that the evening,
which is sponsored by the Intemaa
tional Student Organization (150)
and the Office of International
Students, will leave the audience
with abetlerunderstanding ofolher
cultures. Shceommenlcd that the
event will occur in town instead of
on campus for a reason.

Ndeti explained. “It is an at
tempt to resolve tensions between
the townspeople and college stu-
dents. Onereason there is conﬂict
between people is lack of under
standing. We tried to gel the towns

group at Giinnell High School to
participate in the show. The inter-
national students at Grinnell Col»
lege are not just a resource to the
campus community but to the city

Cultural Evening should end In-
lemational Week on a good note
and embody its theme, “Building
