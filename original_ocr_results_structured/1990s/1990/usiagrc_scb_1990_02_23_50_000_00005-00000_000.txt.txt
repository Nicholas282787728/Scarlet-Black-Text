FAGING FACTS
Why Cling to Failed Ideology?

After the recent political reform
in Eastern Europe. one tnay ask
where the Communist hegemony
will holdoutlongest. WhetherComr
munism is truly dying in the East is
subject to speculation, but it is
encouraging to reflect that millions
of workers, intellectuals and teach-
ers have renounced the myths by
which their counu'ies were so long
governed. It is plain to them, after
living fordecades in societies where,
among otlter things, only one-third
of the hospitals have running water,
that Marxisvaeninism does not
work. Popular opposition has
mounted in Romania, Hungary,
Czechoslovakia, and elsewhere, a
sign that Communism’s strangle»
hold on those nations will continue
to Weaken,

What, then, will be, in the me-
dia’s parlance, the final “domino"?
Different theories offer Albania,
NorthKorea,andCubaaspossibilir
ties. None of the theories may be
right, for it would only be consis-
tent with a recent pattern for the
citizens of those states to rise up and
stagecoupd’etatstomorrow. There
is evidence, however, of a separate
enclave where Socialism may stub»
bornly survive a good deal longer.
No, the last bastion of Marxism-
Lcninism may not turn out to be
Albania, or North Korea, or even
Cuba, In the face of its thorough
and obvious failure overseas, it is

curious to observe the tenacity of
the doctrine in departments of our
own universities.

“As a set of theories that explain
social and economic develop-
ments, Marxism is more adhered to
[at present] than atany other time in
U.S. academic history," said the
University of Chicago History Pro-
fessor John Coatesworth. Is it
“reactionary" or “McCanhyite” to
classify an instructor and his teach—
ings as Marxist? Hardly—that is,
not when the professor, without
reservation, applies the label to
himself, The Princeton historian
Lawrence Stone, for instance, said,
“Some of my young colleagues
call themselves neorMarxists. I
can’t see much difference be
tween their views and mine." A
Yaleprofessor recently spoke of his
noble goal to train “a Marxist intel-
ligensia" to deal with the world’s
ills. Colorful as these examples
are, my research did not uncover
anything to top Eugene Ruyle,
who, in his textbook The Human
Adventure. writes, “The problems
we face as a species ﬂow from the
present system of class mle, capi-
talism. The solution is revolution."
The text is used by a Cal State
University/Long Beach anthropol-
ogy class, ofwhich Ruyle happens

to be the teacher.

As we review these cases, the
question arises of whether Ruyle
and friends read the newspaper.
Indeed, one might reasonably
expectthataftersome ofthe reports
we have received—reports of
bloody crackdown; against un-
armed pro—reform demonstrators,
or of members of the Romanian
“Old Guard" smuggling knives
into hospitals to murder helpless
palienwilhe basic nature of Com-
munism would become clear to its
staunchest adherents, and they
would rethink their views. After
the events oflast fall, it is unlikely
that. even Jane Fonda could still
say with a suaight face that Come
munism was an egalitarian move-
ment of deliverance. But, sadly.
all those unpleasant little news
items seem to have disappeared
down the memory hole of acade-
mia. The professors continue to
preachMarxistideals,butonlyfrom
a safe distance, without ever having
had to live under a Marxist regime
and without, itappcars, the faintest
idea of what such an existence is
like,

You will legitimately respond to
the examples I have described by
asking if they are not few and far
between. In answer, I quote Leslie
Carbonc, executive director of , the

Symposium Demonstrates theClosing of the Gn‘nnellian Mind

According to the Grinnell
College Catalogue, the value of a
liberal arts education is, “critical
and unprejudiced inquiry, free and
open discussion of ideas, and the
pursuit of knowledge,“ and that it
“guards the student against the
narrowness of outlook that arises.
The liberal education is a
commitment to open and free
dialogue, the quest. not to achieve
rhe Tmth, but rather to attempt to
gain a variety of perspectives.
examine information gained
critically. and discuss it rationally,
This being the case, it seems to me
that Grinnell College, as an
institution in pursuit of the
production of liberally educated
individuals, is failing,

This is not simply a question of
bias, though that is part of the
problem, What is at issue is our
ability to set aside those biases for
brief periods so that we may listen,

passed. It is through thisprocess of
critical thinking and discourse that
people as a group are able, not only
to change patterns of thought when
mispcrccptions are realized, but also
to reject the appealing, emotion
laced argumenm that have often led
to destruction.

One could generalize about
Grinnellian attitudes, such as the
dreadful implications carried
through accusations of voting for a
republican candidate, or the
unwillingness of students who hold
opinions on iherighttodiscuss their
views, these are largely due to a
intellectual tyranny of a liberal
majority, which has in turn led to
extreme radiealization of
conservative opinions on campus.
These examples, however. are too
general. The best and mostrecent
concrete example of this can be

found. Ibelieve, in the Civil Rights
symposium, which was recently
heldon campus,butwhere students
allowed their bias to blockade
attempts at critical drinking.

1 was rather surprised by this
particularsymposium, [had missed
the lecture ofLinda Chavez on that
afternoon (I’ve since seen it on
video), but had been told by
someone that it had been
provocative and heated almost to
the point of becoming belligerent.
Arriving early at the evening
discussion between Chavez and
Harry Edwards I asked several
people in the audience who had
been at the afternoon discussion
whathad beensaid. Allmostpeople
were able to tell me was:

1, She made no sense.

2. She was what a cenain
conservative columnist would be if
he were a middle aged Latina, with
aPhD.

While all of these comments were

colorful, and did give me a ﬂavor
for what Chavez had said,none of
them gave me the substance of her
argument.

This inability to state her
argument was a sign of a major
barrier to any attempt at real
dialogue thatevening. While some
very interesting argumentation did
take place, much time was spent, it
seemed, on filibustering as tempers
ﬂared and people on both sides of
the table took part in the verbal
melee. In both sessionsthespeaker,
certain students, and faculty
members were unable to resist the
temptation of reverting to highly
emotional rhetoric.

Similarly, there was a tendency
tocheerwildlyatwhatscemedtobe
nonsensical, but buzz—word filled,

assumed that becauseofthespeaker
and the surface content, the
statement must be ‘good" How
can we ofGrinnell be so critical of
rhetoric and buzz words. when we
are so quick to fall victim to them
ourselves.

I am not attempting to say that
either the liberal or conservative
view is necessarily right (whatever
those labels mean). What I am
saying.howcver, is thatifwe are to
enter the world as well-educated
citizens we must look to develop
theskillsthatthismstituuonpurpons

may not be as open to the liberal
ideas many of us hold. and we may
be forced to defend them through
discourse, Therefore itis necessary
