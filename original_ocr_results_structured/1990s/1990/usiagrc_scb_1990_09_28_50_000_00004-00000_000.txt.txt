Go Climb a

By Tom Gregg

There must be something about
clinging to cliff faces hundreds of
feet from the ground that appeals to
people. Rock climbing has been
steadily gaining popularity in_ the
past few years, as people discover
the activity that has existed in its
own right since the l960's. Now
Grinnell has its own “rock," a 30
foot highelimbingwall lhatwas tn»
stalled in the Main Gym of the
PhysicalEducation Complex(PEC)
over the summert

Organized rock climbing began
in the 1800’s when mountaineers
trained on short cliffs for their long
ascents to “conquer“ alpine peaks.
It stayed small-scale until
California's Yosemite Valley be-
gall to attract sport climbers in the
1960's with some of the world's
longest and most difficult climbs.
Yuvon Chouinard, one of the pio—
neer sport climbers, couldn't ﬁnd
the kind of equipment he needed
forYosernite, so he learned to forge
metal and made hisown. Out of his
enterprise grew Patagonia, a large
climbing and outdoor supply com—
Pa"!

Why do the climbers do it. risk~

What is there about the
rock that fascinates
them?

”It's a rush," exr
plaincd one Grinnellian
climber. “It’s adrena-
lin."

“A natural high ," said
another.

And why did the
College pay $17,000 to
allow people to clamber
around on thisrock wall,
with the danger ofa liability suit?

“Actually. rock climbing is a
very safe sport,” said David Zciss,
recreational sports director and de-
signerof the wall. “Mostclimbers‘
deaths are due to their own mis-
takes" rather thantoequipment fail-
ure or to bad luck.

More injuries occur in intercol—
legiate athletics like football than
in rock climbing and other outdoor
sports. Every climber on the
college's wall must wear theproper
safety equipment. Asfor the cost of
Grinnell wall,he stated that the cost
of many larger climbing walls is in
excess of half a million dollars

“Belay on!” “Climbing!“ ”Climb

harnesses around the legs and hips,
which attach to the safety rope. 0n
true cliffs, helmets are worn for
protection from falling rocks.

want to hone their technique.
Climbing is becoming more
popular throughout the world and
at the college. Grinnell Outdoor
Recreation Program (GORP) plans
to offer several beginning and ad-
vanced climbing sessions through-
out the year, and ﬁve or six outdoor

trips are open to anyone

“People can get involved in itas
much or as little as they want.
whatever they want to do."

International Students Adjust to Grinnell

By Kttwala Nglmlla

Grinnell’s high proportion of
intematicnal students was aug-
mented this year by a second con-
secutive ﬁrst-year class including
more than 30 internationals. Of the
current 98 international students,
38 students from 37 countries are
firstvyear students.

Some new countries, such as
ngary,Qpnis.Mozambiqueand
Zimbabwe,are representcdatGrin-
hell for the ﬁrst time. Maureen
Fitzgibbons, the director of Inter-
national Sludent Services, said the
composition of this class reaffirms
the philosophy of the college to
achieve geographical distribution
in the student body.

 

“The new students are looking
forward to their stay here and are al-
ready very dynamic in student
groups and community activities,"
she added.

International students face many
difficulties in attending an Ameri-
can college, not leastof which is the
question of how to choose where to
go. UnlikeArnerican students, Lhey

rarely get the opponunity to visit
the campus before they arrive to
start classes. This is in addition to
the culture and dietary shock of ar-
riving atGrinnell, which is particu—
larly acute for people from abroad.

Many were also initially sur-
prised by the relatively heavy work»
load. However, most seem to have
taken it in theirstride. Rizwan Gone

 

dal. president of the lntemalional
Students Organization, has found
the new group generally very posi-
tive about being in Grinnell.

Among their difﬁculties was an
automobile accident which seemed
to dampen the eagerness of the new
students, when some intemational
studentsonasightseeing rripto Des
Moines were injured. And the flu
infection which was going around
campus has not made anyone feel
better.

GATES LECTURES /
SCHOLARS' CONVOCATION

Success can be

a matter of making
the right
connections.

Otherwise, the new group is
ready to share their experiences
without much ado. Judit Balassa,a
new student from Hungary, says
the secret lies in balancing between
fun and work. She is happy with
both the diversity ofthc cun'iculum
and the plentiful parties around cam-
pus. Noluvyo Mabophe from South
Africa has found the campus to be
more tolerant and politically aware
than she had expected.

New students say they have
found that interaction between
Americnnartd intentatiortal students
is going well. They add thammcri
cans at Grinnell College have been
generally receptive and accomo-
dating of international students.
