Drop the Early
Drop Date

Friday, February 9, is the last day for a studentto add or
drop a class. The date also marks the final opportunity
students have to declare a class pass/fail. With this
deadline only a week away, students will make these deci-
sions without the proper basis for deciding.

Selling this deadline for the third week of classes causes
many students to drop courses that they might otherwise
continue. Since most courses do not receive giades until
well after the deadline, it is often impossible to determine
one‘s standing in time for the make an infomed decision
about dropping a course.

Likewise, the “Pass/Fail Option“ should be an option
for more than the first three weeks of classes: Students
should be encouraged to venture into different ﬁelds of
study. but in a way that will not imperil future career
possibiities. In situations like this, students shouldbe able
to decide how they wish to pursue their academic careers.

To facilitate student decisions. the Registrar should
Soparate the "drop" Deadline and the Pass/Fail Deadline
from the "add“ date. Additions should follow the current
schedule. Frankly, why would anyone want to add a
course after missing more than three weeks of classes? ,
I-Ioweverfthere is no reason that the “drop" or the "pass/
fail" deadline must be the same day as the “add" deadline.
Students should have the opportunity to make an ade-
quately infomteii decision, and grades should be part of
that decisions.

LE'I'I'EIIS TO THE EDITIIB

To the editor:

> ML Jordan Magill’s claims
(Scarlet and Black: January 26,
1990), namely, that in terms of
material and human loss the Israeli
side has suffered more than the
Palestinian side, and that the level
of Israeli terrorism has been
comparatively less than Palestinian
terrorism, barely correspond to
reality.

In the last two years, during the
Palestinian national uprising,
shooting by Israeli soldiers have
caused at least 550 deaths.
Furthermore, the policy of beatings
and the use of toxic gas has caused
the deaths of anoLher I20. In
addition, teargas used by the Israeli
forces has caused miscarriages and
fetal deaths The number of serious
injuries during this period is over
70,000. At least 50,000 persons,
including over 1,000 women, have
been imprisoned during the
uprising; approximately 14,000 are
still in detention.

0n almost every day of the
Intifada some areas ofthe occupied
West Bank and Gaza have been
under curfcwr This affects
thousands of people Gaza strip has
been under curfew for most of the
uprising. The Israeli forces do not
fortnaily announce most closures.

Theoccupyingauthoritieshavealso
issued special “green" IDs to
hundredsofpersonsprohibitingexit
from the West Bank and Gaza.
Under new regulations, Gaza
Palestinians may exit only with a
magnetic card, linked to a central
computer system based in Israel.
The Israeli policy of land
conﬁscation, house demolitions,
institutional closures, town arrests,
tax raids, uprooting of olive and
fruit trees. daily humiliation. and
harassments also continue.
Expulsion is another instrument that
Israelemploys;duringthcuprising,
58 men were expelled under the
Emergency DeicnscRegulaLion [or
“security" reasons.

In Israeli prisons, the physical
abuse meted out to Palestinian
detainees by soldiers, police, and
inlerrogatorshasmadethesituation
critical. Political detainees released
have complained of blindness,
paralysis, broken limbs, disease, and
nerve disorders resulting from head
injuries and psychological uriuma.
Thephysical conditions of detention
are primitive: toilets are flooded
and filthy, drinking water is
insufficient, food is inadequate and

often spoiled The largest prison'

camp, Ansar}, has up toZ8 prisoners
in asinglc tent. In Dhahariyacamp,

direct physical abuse occurs
regularly. In all detention camps
the health situation is grave: skin
disease, bug infestation, and
respiratory disorders are common.
Numerous methods of tenure have
been reported to be used on
Palestinian prisoners: freezing and
heating units, metal bars, wooden
clubs with nails, and so fonh.

g In spite of much pain and severe
punishments, the Palestinian
determination _ 7 to_ resist the
occupation remains. The *Intifada*
has revealed tltecontroi methods of
ofﬁcial Israel, which has for too
long denied Palestinian existence
altogether. The govcmmentof Israel
ﬁercely maintains its rejectionist
stance towards any political
accommodation with thePalesLinian
Liberation Organization. For its
part, tthnited States government,
with its lavish military assistance
and economicaid programs to Israel,
helps support the colonization of
the West Bank and perpetuate this
brutal, nasty, and prolonged
occupation. Thus, lhe US taxpayers
are picking up, at least indirectly,
the bills that the Israeli army has
spent to build new detention centers
in the West Brink and Ga7a,
