Levine Questions

Police Search

By Diane Brumlcy

The police search of a room in
Younker Hall during Winter Break
has prompted the room’s occupant
to declare the search illegal. Gabe
Levine,residentof room 9328,3ays
that improper police actions render
die evidence of the search inadmisr
sible in court.

According to Grinncll Police
Chief Daniel Boyer, the ofﬁcers
conducted a legal search and cone
fiscated various drug-related mate-
rials. “The drug paraphernalia was
in plain View," Boyersaid. “At that
point. it gave (the police) the au-
thority to funher search for evr-
dcnce of illegal drug activity.“

Levine said that the police
searched through drawers, “to conv
fiscate things that l allegedly
owned." Thealleged items, accord-
ing to Levine, are not illegal in
Iowa.

Grinnell police had responded
to a report from a nightwatchman of
apossibleintruderinthedonn. The
nightwatchman had been alerted by

lights on Younkcr‘s third ﬂoor, and
after notifying police. helped two
officers conduct a roomrby—rootn
search for the suspected intruder.
Police had faced a similar incident
in Younker a week before.

“Normally what you would do,
ifthis were a home, is stop and get
asearch warrant,” Boyer said. “But
in this instance, because the prop—
ertyis college-owned,thecoilegeis
still custodian of the property.”
Because the college had notified
the police, the search was author-
ized as legal.

Jennifer Krohn, associate dean
of Student Affairs said that the
nightwatchman and the police had
reasonable cause tosearch the roont.

Faculty Express Concern
Over Senior Seminar Plans

By Kim Eckart

Faculty members Continue to
review the recent curriculum com-
mittee proposal to create manda-
tory, interdisciplinary senior scmi~
nars. Although many praise the
proposal as the “capstone“ of the
liberal arts experience, some be-
lieve thatcurrent faculty capacityis
a directly—related issue which must
be considered before the program
can be implemented.

According lioFaculty ChairSandy
Moffett, the basic idea of the pro»
posed senior seminar, similar to the
presently-offered interdisciplinary
concentrations, is to provide vari-
ous topics to combine different
departments and methods of think—
ing. The committee’s statements,
outlined in a draft report, also
emphasize “the opportunities for
course development that do not

currently exist...’l’hcy would serve
to intensify the senior year experi-
ence for students."

Moffett added that the seminar
can serve as a synthesis of the lib-
eral arts education. “Students come
in with ascnior level of sophistica-
tion,“ he said. “It's an intellectual
cxperiince at a level we don’t have
now."

Some faculty members also note
other benefits. “The program would
balance the emphasis on education
in the major with education in non-
major ﬁelds." said Chuck Jepsen,
professor of mathematics and
member of the curriculum Commit
tee. “It’s a very positive thing; it's
a different way for faculty to view
there education. where faculty can
focus on non-major education as
well."

The seminar proposal, in its cur»
rent state, is open to modification.

The committee recently began to
elicit suggestions from all faculty
members and has received to ideas
for seminar topics. Other issues
underevaluationpenaintotheﬂexi-
bility and speciﬁcity of the overall
proposal: whether students should
be able to apply the seminar to the
major, the idea of team-teaching,

‘ and the possibilty of prerequisites.

“Everything is still very ﬂuid,”
said Brad Bateman, assismnt pror
fessor of economics and a member
of the committee.

The “i‘luididty” of the proposal is
not the only aspect of the program
up for debate. Moffett suggests that
the date of implementation of the
program hinges on faculty support
and capacity.

Some faculty members believe
that the reduction of course offer-

Crady to Propose New
Dorm to Trustees

By Jessica Weisel

On Wednesday, Feb. 7, Dean of
Student Affairs Torn Crady an-
nounced to the SGA Joint Board
that he will propose that Grinnell
build a new residence hall.

Cindy’s proposal will be given
at next week's Trustees Meeting,
and is, according to Crady, the best
means of combatting the current
overcrowding problem.

The trustees have discussed the
possibility of a new dorm at previ-
ousmeetings, but recentovererowd-
inghas illustrated the college‘s need
of additional housing.

With the current campus hous-
ing situation, Crady said, "We need
about29 (additional places ."

In addition, Crady said that. the
Physical Plant has suggested that
three offrcampus, college—owned
houses no longer be used. These
houses—1019,1023.and1008Park
SL—are “not worth renovating,” he
commented.

Forty-four students are currently
housed in these three OCCO houses.
aswellas 1127,whichwillbetumed
into adminisnativeofﬁces nextyear.
With their removal from the hous-
ing pool, 73 total students will need
additional campus housing. Add-
ing a cushion of 15 spaces, Crady
estimated that a new residence hall

will need to be able to house about
90 students.

Grinnell‘s largest dorm,
Younker, currently has space for
114 students, while Rawson, the
smallest hall houses only 37.

The dean said that the proposal
is not intended to prevent students
from moving into OCCO houses.
Seven houses will remain in use
after the renovations. Crady also
commented that several of the
houses now in use were onlyopened
up to students toaleviateovercmwdA
ing during residence hall renova—
lions.

Crady’s proposal recommends
that a committee be established to
investigate possible locations and
designs for the new dorm. He added
that mis committee would receive a
great deal of student input

Possible locations include va-
cant areas by Younker and Loose.

“It's important to have the hall
integrated into our current situ-
ation,” said Crady, adding that it is
imponznt to have it work “within
our current residential life philoso-
plot"

Crady expects that the trustees
will be receptive to his proposal,
concluding, “The Trustees are very
interested in making sure that the
students receive the best possible
aecomodation.”
