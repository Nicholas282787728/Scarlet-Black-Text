Seniors Attack 3-2

By Jessica Weiscl

“The concept of the 3-2 program
isavery goodone,"saidsenior1efff
Fields, adding, "The reality of it
stinks."

Fields and about 15 other senr

iors gathered in South Lounge
Monday night in an effort to discuss

the 342 program The meeting was
organized by the American studies
Educational Planning Committee.
Studean discussed the problems of
the program, as well as coursﬂ of
action needed to affect solutions.
When the '3-2 program was
adopted, its purpose was allowing
professors time for academic re
search, Under3—2, professors would
alternate between three-course and
twocourse semesters. According
to the seniors, between 80 and 100
classes were lostwhen the program
was implemented, limiting elassA
choices and increasing classrsizc.
The discussion focused mainly
on class-sizes. Most students felt
that the decrease in classes offered
this year has led to an increase in the
number of students in each class.
Fields noted that despite having
to teach fewer classes, many fac-
ulty are teaching roughly the same
number of students. With thelarger

classes, though professors may be
preparing one less syllabus, they
are still grading the samenumberof ,
papers.

“1 can’t see how juniors and
seniors can be happy with the
numberand tliesizeofciasses. And

if the faculty is teaching the same
number of students, how can they

be happy?" said Fields. “The way
[the 372 has] been implemented,
it‘s not an effective program.” .

Larger seminars. in particular,
were pinpointed as an example of
growing class-size, According to
Fields, these courses should be no
larger than the average student-
faculty ratio. The l989-90 Grinnell
College Catalog lists this rations 10
students to every professor. Fields
said, “If departments don‘t have
enough faculty to staff seminars
that are that small, we have to do
something."

One of the main concerns dis-
cussedatthemeetingwasthaiGrin-
hell is not providing the education
that it is advertising. Because of
this, the seniors decided to distrib~
ute material to prospectives and
encourage them to ask'questions
about the issue.

His proposals included circulat-
ing a petition among all students,

and passing out information to
prospective students atApril's pro-
spective weekends. Student con-
cerns will also be presented to the
Trustees during their February
meeting.

Those present at the meeting also

expressed a desire to involve more
students and faculty. Faculty

members are especially important,
because it was their vote in 1988
that passed the 3-2 program.

“As seniors, we feel a responsi-
bility to be involved in academic
issues,” said Paul Russell. While
none of the seniors argued for the
dismantling of the program, coin-
mans were directed at the speed
with which it was implemented.
Their complaints were directed ill
the difficulty in finding classes and
actuallygettingintothem. Accord—
ing to Fields, who is on the Ameri-
can studies EPC, every American

about 65 students. .

“(Gnnnch adveruses itself
as.,.here for the students. It’s nota
research facility,” said Fields. He
added that the quality ofeducation,
which is determined by class-size
and course—offerings, should not be
sacrificed.
