Indoor Track

Records
Fall at
UNI Meet

By Gerald Honigstock

Just four runners, all
teammates. each of whom is
required to race to his utmost
potential in order for the baton
to reach the ﬁnish line in the
least possible amount of time.
These four men--Guy Potter,
Darren Young, Chris Garman
and Ionathan tavevaehieved the

» unimaginable last Saturday at
the UNI Open uack meet.

Each ran as part of the

* distance medley, 800M, 400M,

A 1200M and 1600M respectively,

and their combined efforts set a

’ new school record by a
‘ staggering 20 seconds (10:28)”

The record is more

astounding when one considers

> that the race was conducted less

than an hour from the time

’ when Jonathan Lave had

2 detcnninedly led Division I and
III runners in a blistering 5K
(14:55), and probably qualiﬁed

A for Division III Indoor Nationals

as a result of his resolution. He

also improved upon his old

’ school record by 21 seconds!

The sprinters were also tn
action, as shown by Darren

V Young's 200M in 23:12, also a

anw school record. Another
who enjoyed the tough

’competition was none other

, than John Rogers, a quarter
milcr who has improved his

‘ time every week.

) On Friday night, the Lady
Panther UNI Invitational

’ attracted the same quality of

,eompetition. As usual, JoAnne
Sackett had an excellent series

3 of races, and broke her.week-old

:record in the 1000M by five
seconds to etch a new time of

’ 3:10. Heidi Freiburger raced the

g 5K for the first time since the
cross country season ended, and

3 said she was pleased with her

AIBCC considering her training
The evening was noteworthy
because everyone on the squad

idemonstratcd steady
improvement, with a second
here and a few more there,

>espeeially in the 4 X 200M

)relay of Jennifer Jones, Kate
Peterson, Andrea Shaffer, and

(Amy Reinhart.

1 Tonight the athletes who
qualified {or the State Meet will

>mnke the trip to Cornell and

,compete against the top Iowa
College tracksters. The teams

"are looking ahead toward the

,Confcrence Meet a week hence,
and believe that their intense

’ training and committment will

7 result in an equitable payback.

)One thing is certain, however,
and that is that more records are

alikely to fall-another medley,

a perhaps?

Creating a new image is
what the men’s rugby team has
dedicated itself to doing this
coming season. With a strong
group of 18 returning players,
and nine new faces, Coach
limbo Sadler feels that this
could be the most successful
team he has coached yeti Since
the team has previously won
only one game in the past two
years. he doesn‘t feel that this
will be a hard goal to achieve.
He adds that the nine new
players are the "key to the team
because they push everyone
along.“

The team has had four weeks
of Sunday practices, but will

soon be changing schedules to

: accommodate three practices a

week. The team will be more
dedicated to the sport. in order to
create a new image. Previously.
the rugby men were thought of
being “a bunch of sexist guys
singing sexist songs."

- Although the team will uphold

their partying reputation, the
most important aspect of the
game will be working hard, not
partying hard at the post-game

‘ celebrations.

Grope and Grab: Members of the rugby team huddle up for a practice serum.

The turnout of 29 players is
the largest turnout for rugby
ever in the sport‘s history at
Grinnell, and these are men with
a direction. Already, they have

set their sights on finishing in
the final [our of the Allvlowa
tournament. which hosts 28
teams with 12 in the same
division as Grinnell. The ﬁrst

game is against Newton here at
Grinnell on April 1. and
“although it is on April Fools
Day." Sadler said with a grin.
“It‘s no joke."

game, and stretched the margin
to 22 points in the second halt".

Junior Missy Sharer and
senior Laura Vansiekle led the
scoring with 32 and 20 points,
respectively. Sophomore Leigh
Ashley pulled down nine
rebounds, helpin the Pioneers to
outrrebound the Lady Blues 38»
20,

The conclusion to the game
was one that Laura VanSickle
will always remember. In a
ceremony to honor her for four

years of outstanding play at
Grinnell Collegc, she had her
number retired. She was also
presented with a book of
memories and a signed ball so
that she will never forget her
years at Grinnell and the

ICHAEL'S

excellence that she represents,

Soon after the conclusion of
the Illinois College game. the
team traveled to Carleton, where
fatigue took its toll. After
shooting only 33 percent
compared to Carleton‘s 46
percent, the team was forced to
accept a 68753 loss. Coach
Eskildsen commented, “I'm not
overly concerned with the loss
because our Sights are set on
this weekend."

The final regular season
game was held in Darby on
Tuesday night, and was really
no contest for the team. After
devastating Clarke by a score of
6936, all minds are focused on
the trip to Lawrence and the way
they must play to achieve their
goal of bringing home a
conference championship.
