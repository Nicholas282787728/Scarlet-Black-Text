Exhibits in
Forum

By Brett Fcchheimer

“Look Through My Eyes,"
is the title of the exhibition
now on display at the Forum
Terrace Art Gallery featuring the
works of Kitty Louis ‘90.
Louis. a psychology major from
Harlan, Iowa, incorporates
watercolors, pastels, and
charcoal drawings in her show.

The subjects of these works
range from a pensive heron to a
unique study of Gates Tower.
Her works show particular
attention to color and dclail. In
her watercolor “Florida
Wildlife," for instance, she has
delicately colored the
aforementioned heron, and
shown sensitivity to the detail
of its feathers.

Most of Louis‘ works depict
definite, concrete images. The
pastel “Starscape“ is an
exception. Its lavarlike deep
rods and omnges remind one of
an ominously gigantic, yet
beautiful, sun about to explode.
“Just Sitting" is perhaps the
exhibition’s most penetrating
and personal study. This
watercolor depicts a mostly nude
young man whose eyes. hidden
behind opaque glasses, Seem to
look back at the viewer no
matter where she/he stands in
relation to the piece.

After graduation, Louis says
that she plans to combine her
knowledge of psychology with
her love for art. She believes in
lite therapeutic value of painting
and sketching and wants to use
paintbrushes and paper to help
people with psychological
problems. She feels that this
can enable them work through
their difficulties or vent their
frustrations.

Louis’ exhibition will be on

’ display. in the lower level of the

Forum, until February 21 It‘s

Scorcese Scores After Hours

By Jennifer Manes

When Martin Scorcese’s
funding from Paramount
temporarily fell through for his

1985 film, The Last Temptation _

of Christ, he made an
independently financed ﬁlm called
After Hours instead. Scorcese
received the award for best
director for After Hour: at the
Cannes Film Festival that
summer. The movie ironically
turned out to be a much better
work than Last Temptation
which became notable mostly due
to the religious fuss it raised in
1988.

After Hours opens with the
cloying tone of classical music in
the background. Paul Hackctt, a
data processor who is clearly
bored with his situation, sits in
his vapid, antiseptic ofﬁce trying
to explain the vagaries of a
computer to somebody else. He
seeks escape from his nine-io-five
professional existence in New
York City. When he glimpses at
a woman reading The Tropic of
Cancer in a local cafeteria, he
decides, out of the blue, to
approach hert Just for a change.

A harrowing evening ensues,
as Paul, sheepishly played by
Griffin Dunne, decides to enter
the anarchic night life of the
underground Village scene. The
woman, Marcy, invites him to
her Soho loft. He follows her.
ostensibly to buy a paperweight
from her artist roommate Kiki.
When Marcy reveals her
medication for second degree
burns in her purse and then
proceeds to explain to Paul how
her husband shouts, “Surrender,
Dorothy!” during inappropriate
moments of intimacy. Paul
becomes understandably nervous
and decides to get the hell out.

But, he has difficulty
returning to his world of
normalcy. The movie details his
episodic. nightmarish entrapment
in the neurotic city night. Lost
keys and hopelessly irretrievable
money become signiﬁcant visual
motifs; they are Paul‘s
unattainable tickets out of a Soho
art-scene hell

Quirky, off-beat characters
keep bobbing up repeatedly
throughout the film, each time in
increasingly sinister relation to
Paul, who only wants to go back

home. At one point he winds up
at an allrnight bar. where he
encounters Tom the banender and
Julie, played by Teri Carr, a
waitress with a 1960's bee hive
haircut. Later, he befriends a Mr.
Sof tee icecream vendor who later
mistakes him for a thief and
marshals a neighborhood
vigilante group against him. He
also almost gets a Mohawk
against his will when he stops by
the punk club, “Club Berlin.”

There is no middle balance to
existence for Scorcese. I-Ie
violently juxtaposes the
stultifying daily business world
of the city with the insanity of
its late-night character; where
nothing seems as it is. or
happens as it should. Although
nothing reconciles the two
environs, Paul is happy at the
end to return to his ofﬁce, replete
with staid classical music and the
safety of ordert

After ﬂows is fueled by an
edgy. neurotic energy. It has a
skittish tone, ready to go ﬂying
off killer at any given moment,
possibly due to the creative
frustration Scorcese was
experiencing at the time.

Lee Refuses to Spoon-Feed in
Do the Right Thing

By Jennifer Mattes

_—__
Spike Lee once said he likes

“serious movies that are funny as
shit." He successfully attains this
balance in his third feature film,
Do The Right Thing. The movie
encapsulates a single day of racial
tenslon in the Bed-Silly section
of Brooklyn, where an Italian
pizzeria joint becomes a site of
racial conﬂict.

Lee plays Mookie, a
lackadaisieal pizza dilivery man
for Sal (Danny Aiello) Sal is
proudly ltalian. Underlying
tension is sparked when a hot-
headed beboy calle Bpggin Out
orders a slice and asks,

“Sal, how come you ain’t got no
brothers up on the wall here,"
refen-ing to the lack of pictures of
blacks on the section of

GlZlnnELl.

restaurant wall designated
exclusively for white Italian-
Americanst Sal retorts. "It's my
reiaurant and I‘ll have whoever I
want on the wall."

Thus begins the slow boil of
racial tension which soon
explodes in the broiling New
York City heat Lee reminds the
audience of the heat through his
superb camera work. We zone in
on three older black nle, sweating
against a dramatically solid
background. He shows us people
who are drenching themselves
with cold water in their sinks,
showers, even fire hydrants. The

heat becomes tangible to the

viewer.

Lee directs the Mayor (Ossie
Davis) and Mother-Sister (Ruby
Lee) with a gentle hand. These
two characters serve as the

conscience and tradition of the
community. Lee has a very
deliberate touch, framing every
incident so that we cannot
interpret any movement as
merely trivial. The film is
weighty with symbolism and yet
lt entertalns us.

Do the Right Thing does not
offer any real answers. When Sal
halts Radio Raheem's booming
"Fight the Power," we await the
response. Later, we wonder who

was righluor if there can ever be
a right answer.

The movie is an intelligent
reaction by Lee to the racial
incidents at Howard Beach and
other current eruptions of racial
violence. It cenainly fills the
bill of a “serious movie that is
funny as shiL"

Blow—Up
Exposes

NCO—Realism

By Georgia Dentel

Director and writer
Michelangelo Antonioni
conceives a Hitchcockrlike plot
in his movie Blow-Up, next
week’s performing arts film. The
plot is based on a London
photographer‘s accidental
"shooting" of a possible murder
while casually taking pictures in
a park.

Antonioni is the beneficiary
of the work of Ilalian neo-realist
directors who emerged following
WWII, including Vittorio dc SiCa
(The Bicycle Thief). However,
Antonioni, coming a generation
later, has clearly analyzed the
style of the neo~realists. and
enlarges upon it in ways that
make his films uniquely
complex. Blow-Up artfully
portrays a montage of
disconnected incidents colored
both by realism and fantasy.

The interesting photographic
techniques contribute to
Antonioni’s unonhodox approach
to plot and structure This
progression in style advances
from the simple style of the net»
realists. Also, the creative use of
color gives the film a glow all its
own.
