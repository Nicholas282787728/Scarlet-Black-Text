handicapped indmduals, we feel Ills an injustice that Lhere are no refrigerated water dispensers accessible by the physically challenged in Main Hall. Therefore. we feel that Grinnell College
should move as quickly as possible In inslall a refrigerated drinking founlain equally accessible to all residents of Main Hall.

To Denounce Graﬂ'ni

We. the students of Grinnell College, denounce the hateful. obscene, and debasing grafﬁti directed at individuals and groups. most nolably found on dining hall trays and Burling bathroom
walls.

To Denounce Overindulgence
We, the students of Grinncll College, believe that overindulgence in alcoholic beverages should be avoided. Controlled indulgence. however, is within the bounds of propriety.
