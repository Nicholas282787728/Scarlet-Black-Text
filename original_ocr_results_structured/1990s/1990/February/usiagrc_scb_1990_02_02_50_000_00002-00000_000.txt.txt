McConnell Declares Food
Buying Program“ Economical

By Kim Eckart

A recent report in New »
Newrwavz magazine revealed that
Grinncll College Dining Services
has saved 23% of its costs over a
ﬁve-year period, Accoording to
DaVid McConnell, director of Din-
ingServicesandauthoroftheanaly-
sis the costrestructuring is due to an
innovativeprogramknown assinglc
source purchasmg,

Singlersource purchasing is the
procurement of several related
goods, such as various kinds of
produce, from one supplier. Begun
in 1984, the program has enabled
Dining Services to redistribute the
costs and labor hours required in the
traditional multi»bid process to other
activitieswithin thedepartmenl,said
McConnell.

In 1983, prior to the implemen—

tation of single-source purchasing,
gross total institutional costs
reached over $30,000. After the
first year of the program, costs fell
toapproximatelySlZDOO. In 198‘),
costs totaled more than $9300.
This cost-reduction, does not
mean an automatic decline in stu-
dent board costs. Instead, said
McConnell, the saved money e“,
ablesDiningServicestoholdboard
fees in a better relationship than
what would otherwise have occurred
at the normal rate of cost growth.
McConnell maintained that air
though thesesavings wereachieved
through the removal of such activi-
ties as weekly bids, jobs were not
eliminated or created, He stressed
that costs were “controlled,” which
increased effcicncy and stabilized
anyincreasing costs. “hallowed us
to allocate the saved money into

more volatile areas,” he
said,“.,.Each area of the depart-
mentisaseparateentitywhichinust
break even." Q
Therefore, an increase in meat
prices does not translate into a
greater absence of meat from the
menu. Volume food purchases,satd
McConnell, maximizc returns.
According to McConnell, the
overall reduction in time and costs
“allows more time to improve thC
quality ofthc product,"1de cited the
increase in the catering department
of Dining Services as one such
improvement. ‘
McConnell added that the size
of Grinnell‘s operation is also one
contributor to its success, The
program would be impractical for a
university with much larger pur-
chases. “it would not be the thing
for Michigan State to do," he said.
