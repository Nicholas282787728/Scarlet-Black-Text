Baltimore

It’ s BalLimore in the closing days,
and nights, of 1959. A band of
boyhood buddies talk, enjoy good
times and adventures and hang
out at an unprepossessing water-
front diner until dawn, all to
the tune of the Golden Oldies that
play incessantly in the background.
It could be Just another nostalgia

The Black Stallion-""-

Scarlet&Black

November 16, 1990

Framis Ford Coppola has brought this classic Waller Farley novel to the screen in a truly spectacular stylc. A
young boy is saved from a devastating shipwreck by a beautiful Arabian stallion, an experience Lhal creates a lasting
bond between them. The power of the hint comes largely ircm its sweeping beauty and its mesmerizing
chromatography. it is a film to get lost in and cherish.

Chilly Chili‘y Bang Bang-nu-

This is a weird ‘50'5 British children's movie. An inventor imparts magical properties to an abandoned car, which
beiricnds children and helps them to overthrow the govcmmenl.

Lots of Neat Stuff

lan prizctlghtcrlakc LaMotta, The
film's examination of his chameler
is honest. unflinching and devmd
of ﬂattering embellishments. Jake
LaMotta, as rendered by DeNiro
and Scorsese. is the real thing. the
anecdote to the sterile sitnpltcities
ol an endless slnngol herote Hollyr
wootl figures.

The film intersperses La Mottn's
rise to fame wnh scenes depicting
the concurrent downward spiral of
his personal lite. An irrational,
uncontrollable rtlgc characterizes
and eventually destroys the profey
siontil as well as domestic spheres
of his life.

The movie’s fight scenes are
beautifullychoreographedsliccsof
graphicviolcnce. Bloodshootsand
squirts from beaten faces as fight-
ers circle each other in thegarishly
lit public arena of the ring.

In 2i rccenl interview Scorccsc
evinced his admiraLien for the en-
ergy and rhythm of the climaclic
shoot-out in Sam Pcekinpah's The
Wild Bunch, and his direction of
Raging Bulllssimilarly aifccllng.
There is somelhing approaching
brutality in LaMotta’s fighting.
There is also something appealing
in Lhe visceral deﬁnition of self
through aggressrvc energY; lhc
boxer expresses life at its rawcst
level.

The unfortunate Lmnslzilmn of

far more harrowtng. His domestic
llarcrups burstat the edges oftlght
bittek and White spaces. At one
point. during a rampage of sexual
paranoia, LttMotm nearly kills his
brother, whotn he suspects ot hav-
ing an affair with his wife.

DcNiro as LaMotta seems it-
tally confined in the clauerophor
blC,ul’i)ﬂl| interiors oflhc l‘ilm. His

remarkable. His transition from the
tightly packed frame of a profes-
sionalboxcrtoaslale ofspillingfat
is gradual and pathetic, as it marks
his physical as well as spiritual (lee
clinc.

That he winds up owning a
nightclub, subjchlnghls patronst

pressionsamidst tepid laughteran
cigar smoke, illustrates the inherr

The film begins and ends wit
LaMotta in a mufﬂed state of ex
istence, the diamonds forcefull
chipped and hammered from in
title belt for bail money. Recidng
the famous “I coulda been a con
tender” lines from On The Water
from in front of a mirror, lamot
is a parodic, degraded version Or
his former self.
