No Peace of Mind--

Or Soul

By Eric Bucks
and Mark Baumann

For the $9000 Grinnell College
paid for De La Soul we could have
bought bunches of tape recorders
that actually record, Not that we
gotan interview widt the band. Not
really. What did we get? Dr
fine question. For our $9000 (and
incidentally, it came out of OUR
tuition, not yours) we gotonc great
big healthy dose ochw York City
attitude, And ichacc Day means
anything, it means attitude.

Perhaps the best prescription for
peace came not from the keynote
speech of Helen “Clean Up the Enr
Vtrontttcnl and Drugs Will Disap-
pear”Ctrldicottbutwhcn Posdnuox
(the four-eyed one) of De La Soul
told the PlugrOncs to tell the Plug-
Twos that “There’s a party over
here, Pck y'ull over there!" And,
intoxicated with hope and dioxin-
conlztmtnatcd milk, THEY DID.
After all, what’s a plan for the fu~
ture without elitist, separatist an-
tagonism?

Ofcourse we should have known
right away that this wasn’t going to
be tantamount to the Second Come
ing when the ﬁrst people outon the

floor were grade schoolers from
Des Moines and college students
who figured that “heck, those ten
thousand people crammed into the
space of a large fresht‘olks uipple
certainly won’t step on MY toes."
Asdiverseandcosmopolitan as this
college pretends to be, admissions
suredoes need toupitsquotaofthe
concert literate. Specifically, that
many people in that small of space
means body Contact. Cope with it.
Don ’t goon thedancc floortfyou’rc
looktn‘ just to erutlle your signifi-
cant other. Move your feet. Shift
your weight. And don‘t pass any-
bodyoveryottrhcnd up towardsthc
Siztgcﬁtllalis wherethesixthgrad-
or re. Barel’ectarca bad idea, as
arccigttrcttcsand glass bottles. And
ifyou havcto yell atunyone, yell at
toe z. He pushed ﬁrst.

And while we‘re giving John
Hopkins and his Admisions Posse
pointers, they might want to think
about lettin’ in some folk with
rhythm. Because what’s more
embarassing: paying $9000 for a
band, or having them collapse in
laughtcrwhen nobodyin the house
can clap to the beat.
