Men's Soccer Team Defeated
by St. Norbert's in First Round
of Conference Championship

By Doug l-lodum

The Grinnell men's soccer team
completed its season this past
wwkendwith 39-5-2 record. While
this reeordisnolhingtobeashamcd
of, the team did not manage to re-
peat as Conference Champions.

The final regular season home
game against Cornell on Oct. 10
was somewhat of a blowout as
Grinnell won 34). The following
Saturday, Grinnell managed to dis-
rupthomecomingweekendal Knox
by destroying them 570. Those two
victories completely secured
Grinnell's right to host the confer
encc finals.

During fail break, the team
travelled to upstate New York for
two games in Albany and Saratoga
Springs, After flying there and
practicing for two days, the team
looked ready to take on Skidmore
College, the number one team in
the East Coast AthleticConference.
The team looked good in the first
ﬁfteen minutes, but lost its inlenr
sity for the remainder of the first
half and gave up a poor goal. Der
spitethcfactthatGrinneiioutpiuytxi
their tanked opponents for most of
the second half, they could not
manage to score, and lost 1-0.

The second game, against Col
lege of St. Rose, was played in less
than ideal conditions. The tem-

pcraturc was about forty-five de-
grees Fahrenheit, and the entire field
was a huge mud puddle. These
conditions were less than conducive
to the Grinnell strategy. However,
the team did have its chances but
could nolscorc. St. Rose however
did score, Winning 270. Although
the team was somewhat discour-
aged. thcywere looking to the con-
fercnce championships for to-
dcinpuon.

That redemption ncvcr crime, as
the team lost its semifinal match
ngutnslSt. Norbcrl’s . Fierce winds
greatly affected Grinncll and the
men simply were not able to alter

their game plan enough to over-
come it. After two defensive mis»
takes in the frrstfive minutes led to
St. Norberts’ goals. Grinnell settled
down and played much more in-
tensely for the remainder of the
half. Nanh Lovanh managed to
knock a shot in, and at halftime the
score was 21. Unfortunately,
Grinncll relaxed for the first thirty
minutes ofthe second half. For the
last fifteen minutes, the team tried
toscore butfat'ledandiostzrl to the
team they defeated the year before
in the semiﬁnal game. Despite los-
ing, the team did outplay their
northern division opponents.

The loss on Saturday set up a
relaxed atmosphere for the third
place match against Lake Forest.
Coach John Pﬁtsch decided to start
the seniors and the players who had
seen only limited action dunn g the
regular season. This team played
quite well and managed to score
once while shutting out the opposi-
tion. Phumelele Mbalo dribbled
through the opposing defense and
scored, before going down with a
serious knee injury later in the half.
However, during the course or the
first half. the friendly game slowly
turned into a serious match.

At halftime the team led 1-0,but
only fifteen minutes into the 5er
0nd half Lake Forest scored three
times to lake 2: 3-1 lead As lhcv

starters were replacingtheGrinncli
