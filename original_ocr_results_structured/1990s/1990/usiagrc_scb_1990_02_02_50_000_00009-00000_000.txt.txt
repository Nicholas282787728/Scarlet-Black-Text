Unusual Relationship Charms
Viewers of Harold and Maude

By Brett Fechheimer

Harold and Maude must be
one of the most mismatched
couples in movie history. Very
wealthy Harold (Bud Cort) is
struggling through those tender
years between tlle end of high
schol and the beginning of
adulthood, but the affection and
support he receives from his
socially prominent mother is
almost nil. Harold’s favorite
hobby is simulating his own
suicidewbstensibly to get a rise
out of his mother. Very lower-
middle class Maude (Ruth
Gordon) is just shy of eighty,
with an intense zest for life
which contrasts ironically with
Harold‘s morbid fascination with
death.

Harold and Maude meet at a
stranger's funeral, and the
relationship that ensues
epitomizes the term “black
comedy". Directed by the late
Hal Ashby, Harold and Maude is
probably not for everyoneithose
who think death is serious no
matter what might well be
offended by the humorous
treatment of Harold's many
psuedorsuicides. However, the
movie’s daring premise»lhal
love, and even marriage, is
possible between two people of
such profoundly different ages—
is intriguing, to say the least.
Add to the formula a haunting
soundtrack by Cat Stevens, a
superb performance by the late
Gordon, and the fact that the
movie is freeithere's hardly a
reasonable excuse not to see it!

Blue Velvet Defines
Textured SeX

Blue Velvet begins as a blzrarc
drama which quickly unravels into
apsyehedelic melage of murky sex-
ual images.

lsa‘oella Rossellini is the seduce
tive nightclub singer, abused and
tormentcd by her sadistic husband,
impecably portrayed by Dennis
Hopper. When a young admirer,
plycd by Kyle McClaughlin, enters
her life, he becomes involed in a
world more corrupt and obscene
than anyone could have imagined.

The perversion of Rosscllini and
Hopper's relationship is almost
appealing to us, as we watch the
manipulation ofa beautiful woman
by her husband.

Through superb cinematogra-
phy, the basic plot of psyeo-man— h
abusingrgorgeous-woman takes on

more disturbing tones. With odd
angles and skewed framesofrefer—
ence, the camera reveals the truly
demented sensuality of this com-
pelling film.

The velvety warmth of Ros—
sellini's fleshcotltrastsvividly with
Hopper's leathery cruelty. Sexual
encounters take on new dimensions
in the film; we can no longerjust
watch, but are compelled to im-
merse ourselves in the distorted
physical charades of emotion.

The fine line between sensual-
ity and perversion creatively ex»
plored in Blue Velvet exploits our
own moral uncertainties and
leaves us with images that linger
indefinitely.

We recommend you do not see
this ﬁlm on a first date.

Jungle Obsession Marks
Mosquito Coast

By Susan Craig

How many times have you
heard the expression “Have a nice
day"? Many times, I am sure.
Now ask yourself how many
times have the persons wishing
you a nice day really wanted you
to have a nice day. This number
is probably much smaller. To
Alley Fox, an inventor in the
1986 movie The Masquim
Coast, America’s “Have a nice
day" and “Have a Coke"
mentality made ltim sick enough
to pack his bags and leave.
Where does he go? To one of the
most remote parts of the world#
the Mosquito Coast of Nicaragua.

With his family, Fox sets off
with the intention of living
peacefully in the jungle. Here he
can work on his inventions and
his cllildren can get a useful
educationino more “What’s the
capital of Texas?” information.
However, spurred by his
obsession to bring ice to the

people of the Mosquito Coast, he
soon becomes another, in the
long history of many, who tries
unsuccessfully to conquer nature.
This movie forces one to look at
human nature and how it affects
the earth.

The star-studded cast of The
Mosquito Coast includes
Harrison Ford as Fox, and River
Phoenix as his son. Ford
portrays his character’s changes
from a sane person to one that
becomes obsessed from life in the
jungle. The movie was filtned
on tile coast of Belize and the
scenery is spectacular. If for no
other reason, see this movie for
the cinematography.

The combination of a unique
story line, above average acting,
and breathtaking cinematography
make this an excellent movie that
is worth Watching.

Munchausen:
A Fantasy for
Adults

By Holly Kellar

Late 18th Century.
The Age of Reason.
Wednesday.

And so begins The Advert-
rurer of Baron Munchausen, a
masterpiece directed by Terry
Gilliam. This is a story right
out of that big picture book that
was read to you as a child before
bedtime. But this movie is not
for children. Don't confuse it
with Bambi: Baron Munchaurert
is a fairy tale for adults.

The storyline, consisting of
the Baron's attempt to save his
beseiged city, is secondary he
primary charm of this movie ies
in its characters. John Neville
plays the title role, a man who
ﬂies through the air by means of
a cannon ball, yet never fails to
have a fresh red rose for a lady.
Eric Idle, of Monty»Python fame,
is the Baron’s strong-legged
servant. The movie is further
enhanced by a bit (and I do mean
bit) part by Sting. Oddly, the
performer who steals the show
doesn'teven have his name in the
credits. Robin Williams portrays
the king of the moon, who
suffers from a “person vs.
personality" conflict in the true
sense of the words. As the Baron
explains, “His body and his head
don‘t see eye to eye."

Now, in order to truly enjoy
this movie. it must be
approached with a “willing
suspension of disbelief.“ This
simply means that things are
going to happen that aren’t
reality, and you‘re not supposed
to sit there questioning the why
and how. you're just supposed to
enjoy it.

So go see this movie. You
laugh, and you’ll have a lot of
fun. And you don‘t even need to
be a kid.
