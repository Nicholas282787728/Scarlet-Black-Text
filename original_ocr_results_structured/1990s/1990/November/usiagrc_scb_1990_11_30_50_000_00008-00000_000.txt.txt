Atomic Cafe :
Nuclear Age
Pop Culture

By Brett Fechheimer

In many people's minds, the
1950’s can be summed up as the
Age of the Hula Hoop. Thanks to
lhelikesofGreureand/lappyDnyr,
that decade is commonly perceived
to have been an apolitical, serene
era, a Lime in which America was
content to be governed by a semir
oblivious “father ﬁgure,” and [ads
and frivolity were more important
than substance or realismisort of
like the 1980's, but without Ms.
Pac-Man or crack.

What this popular view of the
‘50’: fails to acknowledge, how-
ever, is the enormously disruptive
and traumatizing inﬂuence of the
newly-developed atomic bomb.
The 1982 documentary The Atomic
Cafe attempts to rectify this mis-
conception. Through lhe use of
early Cold War era newsreels,
Armed Forces training films. edu-
cational ﬁlms and (for lack of a
better term) US. government
propogonda, itexplores the ways in
which the threat of atomic war im-
pacted the American psyche and
popular culture of the late 1940’s
and ‘SO‘s.

A choice example is the “Burt
theTurIle”segment. BurttheTurtle

was a cheerful, Disneyesquc car-
toon character. In TheAlei£ Cafe
we see him endiusiastically dem-
onstralingiprcsumably lochildren
in elementary schools—what to do
in case ofan atomic war, He sings
out gaily: “Duck and cover!" In
another part of Cafe, in a segment
originally Iaken fromalraining film,
a doctor consoles a nervous patient
by saying that he shouldn't worry
about dying in an atomic war, be—
cause iflhcre were one “only about
15 percent of the population would
be killed.”

Indeed, to modern audiences.
The Atomic Cafe can be wildly
amusing because of the naivete,
misinformation and sheer tackiness
of so many ofits segments. In this
respect, this ﬁlm is to nuclear war
whatthestylisticallysimilarReefer
Madnexristomarijuana. However,
on a deeper level. The Atomic Cafe
is a profoundly disturbing docu
mentary. When images of
Hiroshima survivorsarcjuxtaposed
with radio comedians‘ jokes about
that incident, as they are in this
film. the viewcrisforced toconfront
head-on the deceitfulnessss, misr
calculations and socich blindness
that have been an integral part of
the Nuclear Age.

The Apartment, written and directed by the legendary Billy Wilder, is a witty comedy with an
ironically moral message. Released in 1960, it stars Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLalne and Fred
MacMurray. The protagonist of the film is Lemmon’s character, C.C. Baxter, who allows his company’s
executives to use his apartment for their extramarital affairs. However, as one can imagine, this situation
get: progressively more complicated. The Apartment is a movie brimming with both zaniness and
lendcmcss—a film whose style epitomizes the sorlofcinematlc "joie de vivre" Lhatis found in many pre-

Holy Grail Features Python's
Classic Arthurian Comedy

By Jason Eckerl

Certain movies will always be
remembered as classics for their
originality, direction, acting and
special effects: Movies of this na-
ture abound. Few people will ever
forget Gone With The Wind or
Casablanca, lonatncu few. Monty
Python’s The Holy Grail is one of
these movies also.

Movie fanatics shouldn’tbe ups
set; no offense is by comparing The

Holy Gratl with such classics as
The Sound DfMuSlC. But for fine
connoisseurs of comedy, this
movie deserves the abovermen-
tioned comparison.

Even ifone looks at the movie
from a very objective standpoint.
it still clearly stands aloof from

The cast is an incredible blend of
talent, including screen veterans
such as John Cleese, Gram

The storyline also deserves
mention. The Holy Grail does a
realistic job of portraying King
