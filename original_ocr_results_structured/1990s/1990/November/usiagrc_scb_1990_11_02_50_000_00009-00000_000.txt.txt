hE'l'l'EBS 1'0 THE EDITOR
Former Editor Rebukes Criticism of Abridged S&B

To the editor,

Well, Chris Fletcher, now that
you have finished patting yourself
on the back and slapping the Scary
let andElack in the face, let me get
down to the task at hand: pointing
out the grave errors in your ways.

To set the record straight, Iam a
former staff member who was un-
fortunately forced to choose be-
tween my commitment to the
newspaper and my main purpose
here at Grinnell. Obviously. there
was really no chorce. I reg-retthat it
had to come down to that, but my
decision was necessitated by the
conditions under which Scarlet and
Black staff members are forced to
work as explained in the open letr
ter.

Also, just so that you know, de-
spite your claims. you were in fact
offensive and inconsiderate. In
addition, you were often unin-
fonnedand inattentive to the details
of the letter.

So. where shouldI begin? How
aboutwith the first-place award the
Scarlet amtBlac/c received from the
Columbia Scholastic Press Asso-

ciation (CSPA) last semester’.7 The
CSPA, as you must already know
given your sell-proclaimed jourr
nalisticprowcss,isavcry respected
institutionall'ilialedwilh Columbia
University, currently judged by
many to have the ﬁnestjournalism
graduate program in the United
States. Among all smallrcollegc,
non-daily newspapers in this na-
tional association, the CSPA
deemed the Scarlet anaBlack to be
worthy of first-place honors.
Granted, beyond first-place there
were actual medalist positions. but
this publication fell just 19 points
shy of that standard outof a total of
1,000 points. So.maybeyou should
go discuss this with thejudges at
Columbia because their results re»
ally don‘t seem tojibe with yours.

To continue. the staff of the
Scarlet and Black is well aware of
the demands inherent in the field of
joumalism. but given the resources
of the college and the recognized
superior quality of the newspaper,
the staff believes that its concerns
are reasonable and could be easily
addressed. Given the fate of past
attempts at voicing staff concerns,

the current staff-members decided
that acondensod issue with an open
letter explaining the situation was
its lastoption in an attempt to make
its needs and concerns known; oth-
erwise, the whole operation, as you
putit,mightactually haveceascd to
exist. but it surely would not have
been “due to apathy.”
Furthermore, if you had taken
the time to pay attention to the
content of the open letter instead of
skimming over it and dismissing it
as“whining,”you mighthave more
clearly discerned the actual issues
under consideration. However. as
you said, “The general public is not
an entity from which one can usu-
ally expect common sense. . . but
do not blame readers too much."
Well,a more apt wording may have
been, “You, Chris Fletcher. are not
an entity from which one can usu-
ally cxpect common sense," but I
am not as charitable as you and Ido
blame you, Mr. Fletcher. I blame
you for being so quick to criticize
without knowing the entire situa-
tion, not even bothering to pay at-
tention to the real arguments, and
going so faras to hound theSctzrlet

Washburn‘s Analysis Ignored Historical Nuance

To the editor,

MikeWashburn'sreﬂections on
“Campus Newspeak," while se-
mantically correct, fail to take into
account the commonly-accepted
meanings those words convey.

Case in point: “genocide." Yes,
Washbum ts correct in stating that
the word is linguistically related to
“gene.“ However, the ”incomparar
bly larger" crime that Washbum is
perhaps suggesting, the Holocaust,
is NOT an example of genocide by
his own definition.

Contrary to Washbum‘s defi-
nition, however. the term “geno-
cide" is widely andacceptingly used
todescnbe the Holocaust. TheJews
are not, and were not ever. a “race"
of people. Since the first Roman
expulsion of the Jews from Jerusa-
lem in 70 A.D., Judaism has been a
religion and a cultural system. Be-
fore that time, including the era of
Judah and Israel and the earlier
nomadicwanderings,theJews were
a nation, Never were they a “race."

Yet, society refers to the Holor
caust as “genocide.” During the
Nazi-era, what were the racial dif-
ferences between German Catho-
licsandGerman Protestants? None,
What were the racial differences
between German Protestants and
German Jews? None. Although
their lineage was originally from
Scmeticpcoples,theiewshadthen,
and have now. become indistina
guishable from peoples of other
religions.

Judaism encompasses as wtdeti
variety of people as any other
Western religion. Judaism istt rott—
gton, yet society insists on calling

the Holocaust “genocide.” There
fore, genocide has acquired a new
historical nuance: the destruction
of a people with similar interests
and pursuits. Today, the genetic
meaning is neither relevant not
correct.

In my article, I made it clear
that Hafez al-Assad‘s Alawite
Moslemrdominated government
was exacting a tribal war against
the Muslim Brotherhood, a Shiite
separatist group. If the Holocaust,
the systematic destruction of
one religion, can be called “geno»
cide," then the l-lama massacre, in
which almost all Shiite religious
leaders were slaughtered, warrants
the same label. l-Iama simply was
genocide.

Other examples of this common
use of the word“genocide" abound.
The Khmer Rouge’s genocide did
not aim to destroy a specific racial

orethnic group; rather. theydesired
to liquidate intellectuals, business-
men, community leaders, intellec»
tuals and any others who may have
threatened their regime. Abortion
has also been called genocide, yet
clearly abortion knows no racial
bounds. The massacre of Bengalis
in East Pakistan in 1970 was called
“genocide"—yet Bengalis were
simply Hindus with a differentcul-
tural and regional affiliation than
the Pakisranis, butof the satnc stock.
A few lost souls, including Benito
Craxi. prime minister ofltaly, have
called Israel's handling of the Pal-
estinian uprising “genocide."
Again,Palestinewasanation,never
a race of people. The list goes on
and on.

True. many ofWashburn‘s

and Black staff for things that they
did not even complain about.
Case in point: you stated that
“expensive equipment does not
necessarily result in excellent
work.“ I am in total agreement on
this point, but what you failed to
realize is that the staff is not com-
plaining about poor equipment in
reference to the quality of the
newspaper. rather the lack offacilir
tics and poor qtmlity of machinery
compound already terribly long
hours. With the neededequipment,
the newspaper could be produced
in substantially less um and as a
result may also improve in quality
given Iheaddiuonal hours thatcould
be devoted to the finer details.
Also, you mentioned that the
staff “cannotcomplain about inad»
equate funding." Well. surprise,
surprise, Christ It didn’t. but you
wouldn‘t know that since you were
toocaughtupinyourself-righteous
crusade for journalism and the
American way to read thcwords on
the page! Nota single mention was
made of “inadequate funding."
The same applies to your asser-
tion that the staff complains of low

salaries. What hat did you pull that
out of? The very first sentence of
the paragraph in question reads,
“We are obviously not doing this
for pay.” Given this fact, it. is pure
ignorance to Claim otherwise.

In addition, the staff does not
view the condensed issue as “wastr
ing resources" or “rcaders’ time."
And they definitely do not regard it
as “whining." In thatodtu‘on of the
newspaper. the staff was merely
dealing with an issue that required
campus-wide attention, their ex-
cessively long hours and possible
ways of resolving that issue.

With regardtoyoureriticisms of
the paper itself, I believe the mere
fact that the Scarlet and Black re-
ceived such a prestigious award
from the CSPA speaks for itself.

I do have this to say. though.
You cite the paper for being tax in
its coverage and then compare it to
your hometown college paper, the
Advance-Titan at the University of
Wisconsin-Oshkosh. I guess I
shouldn‘t be surprised that you
failed yet again to consider the rel-

Finch's Action Against

CSC Was Grave Error

To the editor.

Bless you. Wes Finch.
Whenever I see your name on the
tailgate ofa ear, I feel proud that
Grinncll Is the home ofsuch a great
promoter of democracy.

While I realize that. your
business was one of the first to
place Branstad/I‘auke signs on its
lawn. I am certain that rencging on
your promise to lend the
Community Service Center a car
from yourdcalership fora semester
was not politically motivated.
Student demonstrations are getting
too darn (pardon the obscenity)
rowdy. They would be just as
effective if the students stood at
least one block away. held candles
and whispered at the top of their

lungs in a powerful chorus, “we
LIKE YOU. TERRY, BUT WE
JUST DISAGREE WITH SOME
OF YOUR POLICIES! WE LIKE
YOU TERRY, BUT..."

While I understand your
anger with the student
demonstrators. I fail to understand
why you chose to take it out on the
Community Service Center, As a
member of the party ofthe “band-
aids.“ you should recognize the
benefits of the CSC to anstad.
With student volunteers, Brartstad
mustrcalizethathecancutwhatever
human services programs he wants
and have free labor to pick up the
pieces.

Yes, Wes, I think you made
