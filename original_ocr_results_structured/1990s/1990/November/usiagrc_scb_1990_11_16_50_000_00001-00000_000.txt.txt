Gtinnell College

Concerts Committee

Considering

By Teresa Denickson

To test if students support ad-
mission fccs for concerts by big-
name bands, the SGA concerts
committee wtll conduct 2 posts
Thanksgiving poll. 11 enough
pcoplc support the idea, the pro-
posal will go into cffcct ncxt sc-
mcstcr.

The proposed concert fee is a
way of generating supplementary
funds that would be used to bring
big hands to Grinnell each scmcs-
tcr. in any given wcckcnd, SGA
spcnds $2,000 to $4,000 to hire
local bands for entcrtainmcnt. But
thc concerts committee would like
to be able to bring in more select
shows from areas outside the Mid
\vcst thatmightcost in tthl0,000
to 812,000 range. To do this, they
have proposed that students he ran
quired to pay a $5510 adintssion
fee for each ofthcsc concerts.

According to Mercedes
Danforth, SGA social coordinator,

Added Fee

lhcproposalhasbocn wcllrrcccivcd
so far. Sllc estimates ihatnbout 70
percent of the student comments
submittcd to the SGA response
board have been in favor of the
proposal. Those who are opposcil
generally don‘tpnrtjctptttcrcgulurly.

Danforth says that other means
of raising money, such as rclvork-
ing ihc concert budgct or incrctts»
tng thc student activities too, were
ruled out because SGA anticipated
even stronger opposition to these
proposals. Under the new system,
studcnts would have a choice
whcthcr to pity the fee or not. If
they chosc not to, they would still
be able to attend the regular SGAV
sponsored concerts free of charge
as usual.

Danforih would like to scc sup-
port, “We’re here in the middle of
Iowa where there's not much to
do," she said, “It would be nice to
make use of the Harris Center fa-
cilities and bring something rcaliy
exciting to campus."

Specifics of New Dorm
Still in Contention

By Craig Wacker

According to Executive Vice
President Waldo Walker, many of
the decisions pertaining to the
planned new dormitory have yet to
be made. The dormitory, which is
cxpectedtohold between90and 95
studcnls, is scheduled to be con-
structed between the summer of
1992 and the fall semester of 1993.

Walkcraddedthatthesilcofthc
new dorm is still in question. His
beliefis that the dorm will lie at the
north end of Loose Hall, making
South Campus mort symmetrical.
The reason for this location, said
Walker, lies in thc ncccssity of
making North and South Campus
Similar in 5126. Previously, the size
difference has caused overcrowd-
ing at Cuwies dining hall on north
campus. Walker-added that the
Loosol-lnlilocation wasnotdcﬁnitc,
but was of “high priority.”

The specifics of the new dorm
are also in question, but Walker
suggcstcdthatthedormwouldhold
between 90 and 95 students and bc

dividcd in Somcmanncr. The divi-
sion, said Walker, would lessen the
size of each part of the dorm and
rcsultinamorcdcsirablcamountof
students in each section.

Walker also mentioned that the
dorm would be thrcc stories tall,
and wouldnot have a "pit" to be
occupied by students. The base-
mcnt, said Walker, would not be
like those of the other dorms. In—
stead, the basement would bc mostly
unuscd.

The deployment of rooms has
yet to bc decided, said Walkcr.
Suggestions are still bcing made as
to thcbrcakdown of singles, doublcs
and triples.‘ Four-pcrson rooms,
said Walker, are being frowned
upon by the new dorm planning
committee.

Walker also mcntioncd Ihtlt the
dorm planning committee was
concerned about keeping the dorm
equal in tcrms ofclass brwkdown.
According to Walker,rneluding
many dirierent types of rooms will

classes in tho ncw dorm.
