Feminists Concerned by High Court Appointee

By Helene Eisenman

The appointment of David
Souter to the Supreme Court by
Congress has raised many issues.
One of the most volatile ofthese is
abortion rtghts, which involves the
possible overturning of Roe v.
Wade, the landmarkSupreme Court
case of 1973. Karen Kulbe and
Gretchen Landwehr. members of
the Politically Active Feminist Al-
liance (PAPA), offered some ofthe
views held by PAPA members re
garding abortion rights and Souter.

The two stated that PAFA is
primarily pro-choice. However.
PAPA also feels it is possible to be
anti»choice and a feminist. Ale
though there are currently no pro-
life members of PAFA. this does
not mean that pro-life advocates
would be out of place in PAPA.

Accordtng to Kulbe and
Landvvchr, the group is seeking to
attract members who are interested
in issues other than abortion rights.
They were also quick to make a
disttnction between being pro-
choice and pro-abortion.

“Iustbecauseyou arepro-chorce.
does not mean, by far. that you are
pro-abortion. It means that you
believe that every woman has the
right to make hcrown dealsion and
she is capable Ofrn‘aking that dceir
sion," said Kulbc.

While PAPA has recently hatl
Contact with the National Abortion
Rights Action League of iowa
(NARAL), it has not become ofﬁr
cially arriliatecl. Although such an
affiliation would not mean that all
PAPA membets are members of
NARAL, it was decided to avoid
membership tor the time being so

that PAFA's freedom OIaCLiOn was
not in any way compromised,

However, an affiliation with
NARAL would provide many ad
vantages for PAFA according to
Kulbe and Landwehr, such as re
sourCes and information regarding
national demonsuations and move
ments for freedom of choice.

Opinionpollsshow the majority
of Americans identifying them-
selves as pro-choice. However.
said Kulbe and Landwehr, many
people are apatheLic about this is-
sue. They feel it is important for
prochoice advocates to take more
ot‘astandonthisissuewhenvoting.

They also pointed out that those
most likely to be pro-choice. the
under725 generation, are also the
toast likely to vote. For example, in
the 1986 midterm elections. the
turnout among retired people was
about 65 percent, but among the
under-25’s it was barely 25 per-
cent. On the other hand, pro-lifers
are extremely vocal and have been
buildingupstlpportfrotntheclturch
and other areas ever since the Roe
decision.

Souter‘siailuretotakcadciinitc
stand on the abortion issue has left
many PAPA members suspicious
of him. They are also concemctt

silence as a political strategy on the
part of President Bush. They feel
that the holding back of informa-
tion is a retaliation for the uproar
created when Robert Bork was boa
ing considered tor the Supreme
Court several years ago. Some

senators, Such as Senator Alan
Simpson (RWVyotttlng), ttctuntly
blamedwomen'srtghtsacltvlstsfor
pushing too hard forthclrtntcrcsts.

Kuibe and Landwehr feel that
the public has a right to know what
Souter's views are regarding abor-
tion and to demand this informa-
tion. They feel that freedom of
choice is the most important issue

Landwehr expressed disap-
pointment at Souter's appointment
and at the fact that he was not met
with stronger resistance in Con-
gress. Now that Souter has been
appointed,PAFA willworkatmore
or a grassroots level by keeping
voters informed about the pmr

PAFA‘s other projects include
workingwiththewomcn'sccnterin

compile and release statistics on
scxualharassment. However. their
main focus will for now be to
support the proAchoicecausc. They
feel this issneis currently in urgent
need of attention. But Kutbe and
Landwchr hope that PAPA will re
main active even if this issue is
resolved in their favor.
