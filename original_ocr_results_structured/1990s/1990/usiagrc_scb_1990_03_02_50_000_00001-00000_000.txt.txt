Thieves Steal
A—V Equipment

By Kim Eckltrt

Approximately 813.000 worth
of equipment was stolen from the
college AVV Center last weekend.
The break-in, which evidently ocr
curred through a basement door of
Goodnow Hall, primarily involved
the theft of video camera recorders
and other miscellaneous batteries,
cables, and tripods.

According to A-V Center Di-
rector Ivan Perry, the theft is susV
pected to have occurred Friday
night and was discovered when a
staff member searching for a
camcorder the following night
noticed the missing equipment.
The A-V Center lock had been
forced open. but the other rooms
in Goodnow were not harmed by
the burglary.

Perry cannot determine when
the equipment will be replaced

until insurance procedures
are completed. Some classes may
bCimmCdltllelyﬂlTCClLXi bythc loss.
“A lot of classes, departments and
organizations dcpcnd particularly
on the camcorders. It's a very
severe loss.” he sald.

Perry added that the worst con-
sequence of the theft is not the
monetary loss of the equipment or
the irresponsibility of the crime, it
is the wasting of college resources.
“Locks have to bechanged, and we
have to get new keys and evaluate
the inventory ordered." he said.
‘This leaves an enormous burden
on the peoplewho have to clean up
the whole thing,"

Although there are no suspects
yet. Perry said, “It was presumably
someone who knew where to go."

The college has filed a report
with the Grinnell Police Depart4
ment.

Suspect Flees From Mac Field ’
Student Escapes Attacker

By Jessica Weisel

On Sunday, March 25. about
11:40 p.m., a female student was
attacked as she walked across Mac
Field. While the student was not
physically injured in the attack. her
assailant managed to escape.

The attacker was described by
the student as between 5’7 and 5'9.
with light colored curly hair that
was short on top and long in back.
She said that he was wearing jeans
and a light grey ski jacket.

As the victim, who has chosen
to remain anonymous. was cross-
ing the ﬁeld, she noticed a man
walking behind her. “I thought it
was someone I knew," she said.
Thinking it was astudent, shemade
a comment about the weather. but
ivhen he began to follow her closer,
she grew more nervous.

“I tried to find out if he was
following me, [so I] switched di-
rection," she stated. “l-Ie switched
and grabbed me.”’ .

According to the woman, her
attacker grabbed her around the
waist and cupped his hand over her
mouth. Sheattempted to hit him in

the eyes. but was unable to turn
around to face him. Instead, she‘
tried to pull his hand from her
mouth and refused to walk, forc-
ing him to forcefully drag her.
Finally, his hand slipped, and she
was able to scream, scaring her
attacker. He fled,on foot, between
the end of Cowles Hall and the
PEC.

No students, the victim said,
responded to her screams.

Immediately following the at-
tack, the victim notiﬁed the police,
who. according to Chief of Police
Dan Boyer, stepped up police ac-
tivity on campus. Two foot-patrol-
men entered campus, while two
additional squad cars circled. Pe-
destrianswerestoppedandchecked
in an effort to ﬁnd the assailant.

Because of poor lighting in the
area where the attack took place,
the student was not able to see her
attacker’s face. She does not be-
lieve that she could identify him in
a line-up. Boyer expressed some
hope lhata witness tolhe attack will
step forward.

The Office of Student Affairs
andtheGrinncllPolice Deparunent

are urging students to report all
cases of assault or harassment to
the police. Student Affairs is also
recommending caution to pedestri-
ans. especially at night. These
recommendations include staying
in populated, well-lit areas and
walking in pairs.

Jennifer Krohn, assistant dean
of Student Affairs, also said that a
campus-lighting proposal made by
the Safety Committee is currently
before Waldo Walker, college vice<
ptesidenL Thisproposal would cor-
rect directional lighting so that it
will illuminate the ground, as well
as add lighting toseveral darkareas
ofcamptts,includingmucltofNorth
Campus.

Further recommendations were
made by the attacked student, who
said, “There are a lot of things I
could have done to avoid [the are
tack]."sheadded that her longcoat
restricted her ability to run, and her
mittened hands prevented her from
scratching the attacker,

“I‘m just as much a victim of
complacency," she said. “[1] real-
ize that there’s no place where
you're safe.”

Trustees
Approve
Tuition

Increase

By Craig Wacker

Last Friday the trustees of the
college approved a seven-percent
tuition increase for the 199091
academic year, bringing the total
comprehensive fees to $16,150.
Also approved were Steiner Hall
renovation plans and the proposal
fora new dorm, both of which will
be implemented next year.

According to President Drake,
the Sevenrpercenl tuition increase
is the “lowest increase in quite
sometime.“ The increase is appar»
ently smaller this year because of a
larger endowment income. This
income, emphasized Drake, has
been growing steadily during the
19805. Tuitionwillreach812260,
room, $1626, and board. $1964.

The proposal for Steiner Hall
renovation was approved along
with an addition to the building
towards the east. The ﬁnal prod-
uct, said Drake, would be a ‘fT-
shaped” building. Construction
plans are set for March 1991.

The trustees also approved a
committee to look into the con»
struction ofa new dormitory, Presi-
dent Drake emphasized that the
purpose of this new dorm is not to
