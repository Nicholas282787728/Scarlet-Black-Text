LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Newmark Misrepresents Liberalism in ACLU Column

To the editor,

I am writing to express how
disappointed I am that. after a
blissful year’s absence, the Scarlet
and Blackhas once again decided to
print the banal drivel of John
Newmark. Newmark's “Notes from
the Left" column in the Feb 9 issue
of the Scarlet and Black was
offensive to thoughtful persons of
all political leanings and it's a sad
stateofaffairsincollegejoumalism
when such inanities garner the
column inches that they did.

Soul Food
Description

was Inaccurate
To the editor,

Two weeks ago (Feb. 9), the
Scarlet and Black described the
dishes at the Soul Food Bazaar as
“exotic." We believe this is an
inappropriate description, To
classify African American
inﬂuences. like food, as “exotic“
implies that they are odd, and not
integral parts of the U.S. culture.
As this is not the case, they should
not be depicted as such,

Washington-based, Accuracy in
Academia, “Almost daily, my
organization receives complaints
from students about professors
abusing their classroom podia to
advance socialistgoals." Ofcoursc,
only a fraction of all such cases
are ever reported to Carbone. Nor
is Marxism the only affront to “ac
curacy" with which we must
contend. The faculties of our uni-
versities are inundated with teachr
ers who, if not openly or secretly
Marxist, are at least as hostile to
the WeSt’s political and economic
systems and its international poly
icy as the most hardheaded
idealogue in a statercontrolled East-
ern academy.

The textbooks I've read for my
historycoursesthisyear,whilethcy
do not advocate Marxism, seem
principally concerned with dcplc»
ting the United States as a
belligerent, ugly, racist, sexist,
imperiarlistandoppressivepolitical
entity (did I forget anything?)
They use the term ‘whitc male’ in
a pejorative tone, as if it automate

As a sympathizer of most of the
goals of the American Civil
Liberch Union (ACLU), I am
repulsed by Newmark’s erstwhile
sarcastic characterization of the
orgmizalion and its members as
being communist. I guess for an
American college student who flits
about from college to university
and back again at will. the
devastating nature of communism
is just some sort of big joke, ha ha
ha. Not that many Chinese,
Romanians, Poles. or Lithuanians
would and it funny, but hey, what
do they know about communism
compared to John Newmark? I’ve
never seen a conservative writer
jokinglyrefertohimselfas a“Nazi"
or “ku klux klan" member, but Mrt
Liberalism, I ohn Newmark, has no
qualms aboutputting himself in the
same ideological basket as Joseph
Stalin, Kim Il Sung, Mao Tsertung,
Nicolae Ceaecescu. Daniel Ortega,
ad nausearn. Pretty neat company
fora guy who claims to be concerned
aboutcivil liberties, don'tyou think?

Elsewhere, Newmark’s
backpedaling on the ACLU's
ideologicallyblindprotectionpolicy
leaves me wondering whether he
cares about letting everyone have
their say or just the people that
don’tupsethis”liberal"serlsibilities.
Newmark claims he has “no idea"
why the ACLU supported Oliver
North. This doesn‘t surprise me, as

it's fairly obvious that John
Newmark doesn't have much of a
clue about most things, but its kind
of funny in a pathetic way.
Newmark’s confusion of candy-
assed “politically-correct"
liberalism with the ACLU's _
largely libenan'an agenda is akin to
mistaking Tracy Chapman for
Public Enemy, so let’s hear it for
sensitive critical faculties, alright?
The Webster‘s New Ideal

Dictionary that‘s perched on my
bookshelf defines "liberal" as
“broad minded, tolerant; esp. not
bound by authoritarianism,
orthodoxy, or traditional forms,“

John Newmark writes, “I am glad
to be back at Grinnell, where
everybody is tolerant of everybody
else, as long as they have the
politically and socially correct
beliefs." Wow, isn’t that what
liberalism isallabout? Apparently,
John Newmark thinks so, and if he
thinks so, then everyone at Grinnell
must, because as Newmark so
graciously pointed out, at Grinncll,
“liberalism rules."

Newmark goes on to say he is
proud to attend the college where
only one Republican presidential
wndidate appeared. Yeah, come to
think of it, I'm proud of this fact
also. It’s plain as day that Jack
Kemp, the one Republican who did
cometoGrinnellintheFallof1987,
andnowPresidentBush’ssecretary

of Housing and Urban
Development.knows nothing about
economics compared to Democrat
Mike Dukakis, architect of the
infamous “Massachusetts Miracle."
Why, under Mike‘s astute
leadership, Massachusetts‘ state
bonds are now ranked even higher
than Louisiana‘s! Perhaps if
Newmark’sbeloved Democrats had
won in ‘88, Dukakis could have
worked his magicon anational level.
One can only dream. And lest we
forgetthe distaff side of the political
field (a dangerous thing whenever
Grinnell’s extremely tolerant,
feminist, thoughtpolice arearound),
there‘s no doubt in my mind that
Kitty Dukakis would have been, if
nota more grandmotherlyﬁrstlady,
then certainly much more ofa party
animal than ol’ Babs (Keg’s empty?

No problem! Where’s the rubbing

alcohol?)

Finally we come to the subject
of illegal drug use. In 2 beyond-
absurdvotinginitjative,thestudents
of Grinnell College said they were
againstcondemningillegaldniguse.
John Newmark is proud of this.
Nevermindalluteeconomic.social,

violence and crime. Never mind

tically connoted a thousand various
Wisms." Like Marxists, they
consistently try to divide historical
groups neatly into the categories
of oppressors and oppressed. The
net effect of the bias in texts
like these, and in similarly themed
lectures—indeed, in so much of
American higher education today.
is not to promote Marxism, but
rather, by belaboring accusations
of injustice, to belittle the
accomplishments of Western
constituuonaldemocracy. Radicals
like Stone and Ruyle will always
thrive in an educational system
that cannot appreciate the
significance of those
accomplishments.

How should we respond to the
influence of Marxism and other
facets of the radical Left on our
universities? Aslseeit,thcsolution
to the problem lies in the policy
behind faculty hiringiin a broader
interpretationofaffirmativcaction.
Affirmative action programs are
designed to insure that the racial
makeup of college faculties reﬂect
theracialmakeupofsocietyatlarge.
But if the ultimate goal is to avoid

homogeneity, to mirror society in
all its diversity, shouldn’t the
faculties' makeup be ideologically
balanccdéiswcll'.7 Canitbesaid that
our college faculties, with their
respecrivepocketsofconservatives,
liberals, and Marxists, accurately
reflect the ratios between those
groupsin American society? Orare
they composed pretty much of one
group’.7 Whereverttisimplemenled,
and not least of all at Grinnell
College, a plan for hiring more
professors of moderate and
conservative appeal will do much
to even out the skewed teaching of
history and other subjects.

Above all, one looks upon the
activtties of S tone, Ruylc and friends
with a sense of grim irony. In one
respect, the nations of the recently
dissolved Communistbloc are well
ahead of us. Students in Prague
have rebelled untiringly against
Marxist indoctrination, and
educational reforms are underway
there and In a host of neighboring
countnes. It is likely that their
schools will go back to the natural
teaching ofhistory,ofliteraturc, of
economics, and Marxist idcxilogy

will lose its hold on Eastern
education.,.while,atthesametimc,
Western schools are still burdened
with it, or with a vaguer. watered
down version of it. This would not
be, if only present-day Western
Marxists had an opportunity atsome
time to live in the type of society

extol. One wonders how a couple

Panama Class
To the editor.

I object to the inaccurate
reporting of my class at Teach for
America Day My lecture was on
the history of Panama. not the
“Invasion of Panama.”

In fact, I spentthe great majority
of the class period talking about the
history and mentioned the invasion
only as it related to this history.
Also, you failed to mention thatl

asnegative. Accordingtooneadult
