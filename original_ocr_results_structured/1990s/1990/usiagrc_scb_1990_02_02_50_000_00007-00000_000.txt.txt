AGAINST THE GRAIN
In Search of the Truth

You’re ﬂipping through thcbooks
for your Intro to Poll, Sci. class.
Two ofthe four books have already
launched heinous diatribes against
most of the nation’s social policies
for the last twenty years before
you’re five pages into the introduc»
Lion. The other two books are colv
lections of historical essays.

You‘re looking through the
course offerings list, trying to de
cidc what classes you want to rake
next semester. You ﬁnd that no
fewer than ten new classes in vari-
ous disciplines have been added
that revolve aroundthe basic theme
that women have been maliciously
oppressed for all of recorded his-
wry,and men are lhesource of allof
society’s woes.

You're checking out tlte list of
upcoming convocations for the
current semester. You see that,
without exception, tire theme of
every convocation can be reduced
to "Some classic liberal notion put
into national or world context"

Perhaps at this point the reader
can see a pattertt developing, The
experiences listed above are not
unusual but rather are the common
experience of every Grinnellian.
Dare weask, ifany individual read4
ing this column, has EVER partici-
pated in a classroom discussion
where the professor’s intent was to
critique a modem liberal ideal or
policy? This writer’s guess is that

that particular experience will be
quite rate on this campus.

In observing this phenomenon
of ideological “total immersion,“
one must seek to understand the
motivation of an institute engaged
in this practice. Two theories come
to mind. It is possible that the staff
and administration of Grinnell col-
lege are secretly conservative. In
that event, their motivation for this
“ideological overloa " would be to
satiate the student body with the
classic “liberal" behavior, and thus
make the average seniors so sickof
hearing the same stuff over and
over again by the time they gradu—
ate that they never again wish to
engageinsaidbehaviororassociate
with anyone who does. r

That possibility dismissed. the
only remaining institutional moti-
vation for this “beat it into their
heads“ activity would be some
warped desire by this school to turn
out class after class of “good liberr
als." Judging from the Grinnell
experience, is it any wonder that
studies haveshown liberalism lends

all disturbing that Nazi Germany
and Stalinist Russian similarly
found that “patriotism" increased
with “education?“ The assertion of

the leftist slant to the Grinnell
Experienceneednotbedocumented
in tttis column, every student need
only look back to the classes he or
she has taken in the last year for
proof of its existence. One cannot
refute the evidence presented by
one‘s own eyes.

Is this the “education” for which
each of us pays $16,000 a year?
Perhaps in one senseof the word we
are boing “educated,” but it seems
the question boils down to whether
we have come to Grinnell ,to be
indoctrinated into a liberal way of
thinking, or whether we have come
here to seek the truth Is Grinnell
liberalism the truth? Is the liberal
version of reality the correct one? If
it is, it need not fear being ques-
Lioned, not perhaps even criticized.
If it is not, then it has no business
masquerading as the truth. If it is
not,thenbrain-washingthestudents
of Grinnell College into drinking
that it is, is no more moral than a
Stalinist rereducation camp. The
truth can be attacked. but it will
remain the truth No argument has
ever changed reality. I ask the fac-
ulty, staff and administration of
Grinnell College, “What are you
afraid of?"

Drake with a proposal. The pro»

Racism: A Hidden Friend

By Eddie Chung

Rice deﬁnitely goes soggy
first. Racism, my best friend,
revealed this to me. He always
takes the time to reveal trivia to
me. Racism has been around as
long asI can remember, and he
always goes out of his way to
let me know he's around when
I'm feeling lonely. I-Ie is very
reassuring and he frequently
comforts me in knowing that
God is not going to yank the
earth out from under my feet.
As long as racism exiSLs I feel
assured that the world is not
changing on me, that I am not
going to be left behind. Sure
progress is good, but slowly
please; the pond called "the-
fumrcrwhen-everyonermlemtes-
each-other" is icy cold, and I
want to ease myself in slowly.

Sometimes I wonder if life
would be half as tolerable
without my friend? I doubt it.
To rid my friend from this world
would require a broad
perspective, and people would
have to accept the importance of
learning that the United States
is diverse. When I bask in the
comfort of my friend I am in
familiar surroundings I feel
conﬁdence when in a place I
recognize

The damnedest thing
happened to me the other day at
a Gardner party. I'm sure you
know that a lot of drinking goes
on at these social functions, and
sometimes things get out of
hand. Inhibitions are relaxed

and people do and say quite a
few things which happen to
seep out from the back of their
minds. Anyhow, my evening,
which happened to ooze fun,
was suddenly mopped up with
an argument I had with a
dormmate. I subsequently felt
rotten. But this is the good
part. A lot of stories have
happy endings, and this one
does too. Sulking in my
broken heart, I receivm a sudden
reassurance that the world wasn't
going to end that evening in
Hector's. Just when lhecded
someone to comfort me, my
besrfriend appeared to give me a
pep talk. Usually he greets me
with a bad joke,

"Say, do you like 'Crispix‘
cereal? You know, corn on one
side and rice on the other?"

I wasn't sure what he was
getting at. I was confused. I
thought in myself: "What does
he mean?"

He continued. “I was just
wondering. What side do you
think goes soggy first, the com
side or the rice side?" Having
had three full semesters of
college already, I recognized that
this is one of those questions
that I would have to think out
methodicallyr I would have to
analyze, through induction,
which grain would seem to
resist liquid the most. SinceI
have had only three semesters of
college, I gave him the wrong
answer. com.

America Must Face the Challenge

Many Americans seem to
express a fear that this country‘s
economy is about to be swamped
by a new flood of
Japanese and
European imports.
Many also express
concern about the
federal deficit and about the social
problems that this otherwise
prosperous country faces: drugs,
poverty, crime, transport gridlock
and the inner cities. But when it
comestoactuallydoingsomething,
politicians and special interest
groups shy away, instead calling
for more of the same, Tax cuts, cuts
in public spending, and prison
building are all on the agenda. Yet
nooneseems to be discussing more
money for Amtrak, socialised
medicine, and money for decent
lowrincomehousingr Thiscountry
has been number one throughout
this century, But for how much
longer? The Japanese and
Europeans are quickly catching up.

The American people and their
representatives in Washington
should realize that it is not the way
of champions to sit on their laurcls.
Champions who do sit on their
laurels gctbeaten sooner or later. It

same policics will in time be the

ruin of this country. That cannotbe
allowed to happen.

The solution that is needed will,
however, not come
easily. For it
requires a shift of
historic magnitude
in government
policy. It requires acceptance of the
principle of the Social Market by
the politicians and people of this
country. This is a policy which
combines high government
spending on social and economic
programs with the principle of the
free market. Itisadifﬁcultdecision
to make. But, as the examples of
Japan and West Germany prove,
thebeneﬁtstoindustryandordinary
people oflow costloans, socialized
medicine, and subsidized transport
have made higher taxes well wonh
paying.

John Kennedy in 1961 made the
now famous remark “Ask not what
your country can do for you but
what you can do for your country."
Perhaps now, in 1990, this phrase
needs a little revision. For you and
your country are dependent on one
another, and a genuinely
interdependent relationship is
needed if this country is to stay
competitive with Japan and Europe
into the 21st century.
