Future of Multi-Culturalism

By Kim Eckart

The 1990 Civil Rights Sympo-
sium, “Mum-Cultural Students in
the Euro-Ceno'ic Educational Sys—
tern," will be held next week, Feb-
mary 678. The event, featuring four
notable speakers, is sponsored by
the Ofﬁce of MulLi~Cttltural Affairs
and the Rosenﬁeld Program in
Public Affairs, International Rela-
tions, and Human Rights.

Dr. R. Roosevelt Thomas, In.
executive director and founder of
The American Institute for Manag~
ing Diversity, and Professor Ling-
Chi Wang, Department of Ethnic
Studies chair at UC»Berkeley, will
speak on the respective issues of
multi—culturalism in the workplace
and relations among minority
groups. Professor Harry Edwards,
also a member of the Ethnic S mdies
Department at UC-Berkeley, will
deliver Thursday's Scholars Con-
vocation,concemingmulti-cultural
curriculum at the university level.
Linda Chavez, syndicated colum-
nist and National Public Radio

. 'In this Issue

commentator, will also speak about
the education of ethnic minorities.
Both Edwards and Chavez will
conclude the symposium with a
panel discussion.

According to Eric Wynn, direc-
tor of Multi—Cultuml Affairs, the
theme represents not only a new
direction for the Ofﬁce of Multi-
Cultural Affairs, formerly called
the Ofﬁce of Minority Affairs, but
perhaps a new direction for the
campus as well. “It’s an announce—
ment of where we’re going,"Wynn
added.

This is the fifth annual Civil
Rights Symposium. Past themes
have included “Civil Rights: Past,
Present, and Future" (1986), “Race
and Class in America" (1987), and
‘The Truly Disadvantaged: Mi-
norities in Inner Cities" (1989).

The theme of the symposium
varies each year according to deci-
sions by the Civil Rights Commit-
tee. The Committeeiscomposedof
Wynn, Wayne Moyer, Director of
the Roseni'leld Public Affairs Pro»
gram, and 12 students, representa-

tives of the organizations directly
involved in multi-cultural affairs,
such as All Students Interested in
Asia, Concerned Black Students,
and Student Organization for Lati-
nos/Latinas.

Students on the committee urged
the campus community to auend
the symposium. "Thi s will be an
excellent symposium, " said Eddie
Chung, representativeof ASIA, "we
hope it will spark a new movement
of muIIi-cultural awareness."

Chung also mentioned the need
for changes on campus. ”We hope
to move on and have changes in the
Cuurlculum, speciﬁcally, more di-
versity, such as an inclusive his-
tory, not one that [ocusses on Euro»
centric issues," he said.

Wynn emphasized the studenw’
input in the ofﬁce name-change, so
that the ofﬁce would be more repre-
sentativeofall minorities, and their
choice ofthesymposium themettnd
topics. “This year we have themost
diverse symposium—the one that
will cause the most impact,” Wynn
said.

Overcrowding:
Is 3—2 to Blame?

By Craig Wacker

Spring semester has arrived.
bringing with it a ftuntliar sight:
overcrowded classes. From senior
seminars to introductory lectures,
students and faculty alikcarcnoticr
ing the expansion, and many atLribr
utc it to the 3-2 program.

The 3-2 program, implemented
two years ago, enables professors
to lighten their teaching loads and
allows them to do research and
improve thetr work. According to
Jonathan Andelson, anthropology
department chair, other colleges
have used the 32 program prior to
its incorporation at Grinnell, make
ing its installation here a long
awaited cvcnt.

Since utc‘tmpternenuuon othc
3-2 program, professors teach five,
instead of six courses per year.
This, in turn, limits the amount of
faculty available each semester and
limits the number of courses ofr
feted. Andclson estimated thatap-
proximately 80 courses have been
eliminated from thecurriculum due
to the 3-2 program.

Although introductory classes
are generally large, these courses
are not greatly effected by over-
crowding. In {acc introductory
courses, said Registrar Roger
Lasley, have certain mitigating foo
torswhichmakelargelectureclasses
manageable.

For instance, science courses,
which often have the largest class
sizes, have lub Scctlons which give
students more personal attention.
Karl chong, professor of one of
the larger biology lectures, agreed
that labs of fer more personal atten-
tion to students.

Recent concern about over-
crowding, though, has centered on
uppcrrlcvol courses, Students
havcalso expresseddisappoinuncnt
athugecluss sizes in courses necesr
sary to complete one’s major,

Some students mention the prob-
lems of overcrowding in upper-level
classes, possibly due to a lack of
classes aimed at non-majors. “I
don’t feel we offer enough classes
to non-majors,“ said Chris Plantier,
member of the'economics Educa»
lional Policy Committee (EPC).

Others point out that the over-
crowding may bc due to under-
staffing. Chris Victor, member of
the biology EPC,said,“’TheEPCis
constantly talking about how un-
derstaffed the faculty is in the bio
department"

According to Dean of Faculty
Charles Duke, the college is work-
ingdiligendytoacquiretwotothrec
new faculty members each year.
With each new faculty member, the
amount of courses offered grows
considerably. Therefore,relief from
overcrowded classes may be de.
pendent on time.
