'Hodum Congratulates Softball Finishes Most

“Graduating Athletes

~ By Doug Hodum

As I sat at the dinner table,
.about two weeks ago. I was joined
by two members ofthe track team.
hile we ate, we discussed athlet—
'cs and the driving force behind
them.
' One of my colleagues claimed
,that personal satisfaction was the
only true point in competing at the
ﬁrvision III level. He claimed that
.winning and losing were not the
most important matter. but that the
‘purpose of having athletics at this
devel was topush yourselfand show
discipline. His claim was that
’winning is nice, but the c0mpeti~
Jim and discipline of any sport is
the true utility of athletics.
‘ I sat there and argued that while
gvinning is indeed not everything
there is to competition, it is core
otniniy a good motivator. l-Ie con-
urred, but said that self-motivar
. tion and El solid effort is all that is
‘teeded in order to admire someone
who is trying.
I defended myself by attempt-
".ng to explain that motivation is
(Here easily achieved if there are
victories in thepast and morein the
”ear future.

ﬁccepted form. There are moral
qiciories, and admiration is de-
served by everyone that makes an

icluding myself. rest too much
mphasis on the actual victory.

L while we ignore a moral victory, or
even just the often being made.

That discussion made me real-

ize that while it is nice to win, it is
"O! everything. When I was
gounger, I tried to live by that ide-

ology. Unfonunately, as I have
grown older, my outlook has
changed.

I would like to congratulate all

I would like to thank the foot

Softball

Successful Season Ever

By Susan Thomas

The Grinnell softball learn con-
cluded their season last Saturday
with a doubleheader against Illir
nois College. The team lost both
games, 6-2 and 473 in their season
finale. thus ending any hopes of
receiving a conference tournament
bid.

Illinois College took a 2701czId
in the fourth inning of the opener
and added four additional runs in
the seventh. In the seventh, Grin-
nell started to rally with a Kerry
Mai-r walk, a Chris Tumbuli Single
and a double by Tera Jones, The
Pioneers,howcvcrcould oulyscore
two runs and leftioncs stranded at
second base.

In llie nighlcap,GrinncI1 shined
quickly. posting two runs in the
first, but Illinois College retaliated

with four in the bottom half of the
inning. Mary Allenburg helped the
Pioneers in the third inning with a
doubleandarun scoredbutlllmois
College held on for the double-
header sweep.

Coach Jim Gilbert commented
about the team‘s play, “We were
flat and couldn’t get any fire the
whole day. In our league we need
to pltty well in order to win."

The weekend concluded the
Pioneer season as the team posted a
6-5-lovcrallrecord,whichincludes
two forfeit wins. and (147571 record
in the Midwest Conference. TI’ICII’
record carried the team into fourth
place in LlIC south division. The
ieitm won when it played good
defense. “We were a step better
than lost your and we continued to
improve. Our young people also
gota ycurorcxpericnce under their

Outdoor Trac

belts," said Gilbert of the season.

Mary Allcnburg was the only
Grinnell pitcher of record. Shcand
fellow complain. catcher Judy
Thorn, worked the opposrtion
masterfully. Allenburg posted a
I.75 ERA with 14 strikeouts and
only 12 walks.

Freshman Tera Jones. a half»
time starter at third base, led the
team with a .338 batting average
whiloThortthit.322andAllenburg
.303. Sophomore. Muude Logsdon,
part-time'nghtftcidcr, also had a
.333 batting average. Terra Geiger,
also a sophomore, led the team in
fielding with no errors from her

Gilbert will lose only three sen-
iors, Karen Glenncmeter, Jennie
Robinson, and Chris Turnbull, so
the prospecLs look good for next

year.

Track Teams Compete at Drake
Relays, Loras College

By Gemld Honigstock

Drake Relays. The very name
stirs a deep set of emotions in most
Iowans. Even those unfamiliar
with the deep-rooted Iowan
tradition sense that this meet is
special. and so it was with extreme
intensity that the men's Distance
Medley Relay set fonh last Satur-
day.

Beginning amongst 25 other
teams,including Division Isquads,
Chris Garmzin led off on a ﬁne
I200M [cg before handing off the
baton to speedy Darren Young.
whose49second splitkeptlheieum
in the hunt. Guy Potter then made
up some ground despite the blusr
tery day with a 1:57 800M, and let
Jonathan Lave’s 4: 14 mile lead the
team to a ninth place finish with ti
new school record by I 1 seconds of
10:09!

Lave was also entered in lite

1500M, Unethical and downright
mean race tactics by Iowa State
runnerlonah Koech tripped upLavc
in the first 150M of the race as
Koech pushed his way to the front
of the pack. Suffice it to say that
Lavewas extremely peeved and his
twisted ankle only served as a
reminderofwhalmighthavc been;
he knew that he was ‘on' as Soon as
he started.

Meanwhile, a dozen tracksters
traveled toLoras College fora meet
of their own. Benn Tannenbaum
had an awesome day. running his
best timcsofthcscason in the 100M
(112) and 200M (23.6). [it the
1500M, Dave Sheridan ran a smart
race. and oulkickcd the leader in
the last 20M to win in a time of
4:03. a new personal best by an
amazing five seconds.

Perhaps the highlight or the day
was Coach Evelyn Freeman's race
in the 400 Hurdles. Freeman dcmr

Lhan teach by attaining second in
the heat.

Tomorrow the teams will attend
an open meet at Coe as a final
tune-up for the Conference meet
a week hence. As the season
draws to a final climax at Confer-
ence. as well as at Nationals for
some, it seems appropriate to ac-
knowledge those whose commit-
ment and dedication sustained the
teams: for some, as long as four
years.

Those seniors are Michelle
