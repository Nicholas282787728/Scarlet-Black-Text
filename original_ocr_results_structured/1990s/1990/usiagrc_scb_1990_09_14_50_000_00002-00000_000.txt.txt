Student
Center

Delayed
Through
January

Because of an extremely wet
summer, the Harris Student Center
will not open until second semester
of this year, instead of the original
date of Nov. 15

“We're hoping to open the mu»
ter at the start of the spring semes-
ter,” said Dean of Students Torn
Cladyr “We Lhink it'sfairly realistic
(to think so) at this point. The
weather is what has halted the
progress on the building.“

The rain over the summer de-
layed work because it prevented
workers from pouring footings. To
avoid funher delays, Crady said,
they will try to enclose thebuilding
before the weather turns cold. This
way, snow will not interfere with
any of the construction.

“The main concern right now is
the closing of the building, so they
can do the interior work,“ he said.

The Harris Center will contain a
400-seal cinema, facilities for out
door concerts and an indoor con-
cert hall capable of seating 500
people. Acoustically, me cinema
and concert hall will be superior to
all of the currently existing campus
facilities.

Crady recommended that any
and all incidents of harassment of
students by construction workers
be reported to Student Affairs

"We will explicitly outline lo
the people at that meeting that that
is not appropriate and we're not
going to tolerate that,“ said Crady,
who meets weekly with the con-

tractor.
