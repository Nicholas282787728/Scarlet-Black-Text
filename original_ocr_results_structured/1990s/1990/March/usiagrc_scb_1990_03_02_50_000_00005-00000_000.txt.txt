Sculpting Contest Attempts to Make . ‘ .

CondOms Part of Grinnell Experience

by Ann Treistman

 

"We‘re trying to explode the
myths," explained Thomas Main,
afterbreakingopanainessecond‘s
Penis Pinata at last Friday’s
Condom Sculpting Contest.

The contest was held by the
Human-Gay Resource Advisory
Council as a part of National
Condom Week. Dave Clark, an
R.A, and member of the council,
cited the contest as, “A fun and
different approach to the on-going
AIDS education."

WHO, channel 13.the local NBC
affiliate, covered the contest but
refused to put the pinata on
television. Its creators were irate.
Max Schott saw no reason that the
sculpture should not be shown:
“People are afraid of their own
genitals,“hesaidoaddingthat,“'[his
is exactly the sortof fear that we’re
tryingtobreakdown.”GeoffLarson
felt that it was zi definite case of
“peniphobia.”

The students who attended the
contests seemed toenjoy the humor
of the Penis Pinata and appreciate
theseriousness ofsome ofthe other
entries. The sculptures certainly
captured everyonc's attention. The

of a greater cause.

Jody Bloblum said thai her
group \ entry. "The Same ot’Sexual
Liberty", emphasized the idea that
billh control should be the
responsibility of both parties
involved. She, Ariel Worth, and
Karin Sedestrum designed their
sculpturewuh thethemes of liberty,
equality, and responsibility in
mind.

Bloblum stated that. "Birth
control is an issue which should be
discussed." She potnwd out the
articleaboutawoman whowouldn't
have sexwith aman if he refused to
wear a condom which decorated
one side of the"statue".

Most of the sculptures displayed
some form of printed material on
sexuality. AIDS, sexually
transmitteddiseases,andthemixmg
ofalcoholandsexwereall included
in various forms on the different
entries.

The five judges based their
decisions upon criteria ranging
from symbolism/theme to basic
aesthetic values. More than one
was heard muttering how difficult
itwas to choose only three winners.
Overall, they seemed to feel that
all of the sculptures were--dare
Isay-- very well built Thepariel
ofjudges, made up ofa variety of
peoplechosen by the council, finally
did come up with three winners.

Paul Froese, the sole judge who

attended Grinnell as a student,
eloquently introduced the winning
entries. “Oscar Wilde once said.”
began Frocse, “that ‘Art is not a
thing, it’s a «way."’ Froese
discreetly tied these words of
wisdom into the main thrust of the
entire contest as he loudly decreed,
“And we Watit to make condoms a
way oflifet"

Froese revealed third place first.
Tortilla Flat, with their “Top Ten
Reasons to Use a Condom” list
(Number Three: “Pisses off the
pope”) captured the hearts of the
judges, They also addressed the
role that liquer can play in sexual
encounters. No matter what the
circumstance,saidTorijllaFlat,“No
glove, no love. "

l-laines third developed a new
and unusual way to use that infar
mous glove: try it on a bun. Second
prize went to Haines third, with
their not-so-typiczil portrayal of a
hot dog lunch from Hardee‘s. The
meal encouiagcd a hotrdog “with
everything on it.” The dog itself
was formed out of a blownrup
condom, and finished off with on-
ion rings,

First place honors were given to
“The Dresser," from Polly
McLachlan and Laura Light. This
more serious entry featured a drawer
halfropcn to reveal various literature
on safe-sex. a couple ofletters, and
things that might be found in
anybody’s dresser‘dmwer. On the
top were two condoms, and the
accompanying explanation warned
the mower to note a condolence
Card tucked behind the mirror. This
emphasized the consequences
which couid occur if unprotected
sexual intercourse occun‘ed and
AIDS was contracied.

From serious to humorous. all
the sculptures were concerned with
the importance of using condoms.
Each one provided very real and
timely information. At the very
least as Tortilla Flat's listobservcd
in the Number Nine slot, condoms
“help you keep score." At the very
most, as “The Dresser" forcefully
illustrated. a condom can save your
life.
