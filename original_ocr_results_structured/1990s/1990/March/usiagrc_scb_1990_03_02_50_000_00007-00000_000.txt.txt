Sandinistas Lose Election

Soviet Union. The Soviet government has legalized
leasehold tenure of farmland. and the sale of produce
from such farmland on the free market. This however
is only the beginning of what promises to be a policy
of wholesale privatisation. Prime Minister Nikolai
Ryzhkov suted last week that the proportion of state
ownership of property, currently around 85 percent,
needs to come down to around 30 percent. limited to
such , sectors as
uansponation, energy
and social services.
Nicaragua. Following
the decisive electoral
victory of Violeta
Chamorro as president
and of her 14-party
coalition, outgoing
President Daniel
Ortega has demanded that the contras be disbanded.
Both Presidentrelect Chamorro and the president of
Honduras have supported this demand. But contra
commanders are holding out until the inauguration of
Chomorro‘s government on April 25th before they
will even negotiate The Sandinista Front’s sharp
declinein popularity overthepast two years isaltributed
toits continuation of the draftduring peacetime and its
failure to control inﬂation.

nearest rivals, the Communist dominated Socialist
Unity Party, in the East German election to be held in
two weeks time. A landslide victory for the SPD has
become a possibility due to resentment of the rough
tactics used against the East German government by
the West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl over the
issue of Economic aid. l-lis Christian Democrats have
failed to make much of an impact on the East German
political scene.
Meanwhile there is
now talk of individual
West German states
giving aid to East
Germany ifthc federal
government fails to do
so,

Nepal/India. The
Indian govemment is
considering relaxing sanctions against Nepal imposed
last year. However it is thought that some political
concessions may be exacted by India from Nepal for
the sanctions.which includethcclosure of mostborder
crossings, robe lifted. Nepal was recently die scene of

by the government It is believed that former Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi wanted the sanctions lobe used
as a leverage for the 30 year old ban on political parties
in Nepal to be lifted, though the attitude of current
Prime Minister V P. Singh is unknown.

Reader Responds: Marxist Theory

Differs from European Reality

To the editor,

In his “Facing Facts“ column
last week Mikc Washbum sets out
to show that “Marxists“ are
overrepresented in our universities,

,However, this claim is very
misleading, becauseMr. Washbum
fails to distinguish between
MarxismrLeninism as a form of
government and the use of Marxist
theories as analytical tools. Mr.
Washburn takes as his point of
departure Professor John
Coateswonh’s statement that “as a

set of theories that explain social
and economic deveIOpments,
Marxism is more adhered to [at
present] than at any othcr time in
US academic history,” and he
seems to believe that any professor
who adheres to these theories is
only a few short steps away from
advocating revolution. Mr.
Washbum seems unaware that one
can disagree with Marx on the
proper course of future events and
still accept his analysis of the
transition of European economics
from nfeudztl toacapitalistsystemr

Many anlircommunists are deeply
inﬂuenced by Marx's View that
economic factors are of primary
importance in social and political
affairs.

Mr, Washbum seems convinced
that most professors in American
universities are either Marxists or
proponents of other doctrines that
“belittle the accomplishments of
Western constitutional democracy,"
Ironically he proposes to combat
this problem by making ideology

I Appreciative Fan is Good Fan

To the editor:

With only hours left before his
deadline, Doug Hodum sits down
to write his commenmry on Grinnell
College sports fans for the Scarlet
and Black. The pressure is intense;
his article could make or break the
issue. Suddenly, someone in the
back of the room bellows,
“Noonan.” Hodum, startled, tries
to show up the heckler by
composing a brilliant piece of
journalism. He fails, AlMcGuire,
watching the scene from the
sidelines comments,“Don’rworry,
the best thing about freshmen is
that they become sophomores.”

Mr. Hodum not only questions
ibc‘goodncss" nfGrinncllCollegc
sports fans. llC goes so [Brits to cull

them ignorant. I,aferventsupponer
of Grinnell College athletics during
the past four years, resent this
accusation. While it is true that
some of the comments that
reverberate from the bleachers of
Darby are classless, they are not
meaningless. Opposing players,
contrary to Mr. Hodum's belief. do
hear the noise. One needs only to
look to certain fingers raised by
rival contestants in the general
direction of the fans in the stands as
evidencetothisfztct. Heckling,Mr.
Hodum, is part of the game.
Anything atall that distracts aplzlycr
from the task at hand lowers that
player's performance. Noise is a
distraction.
While I can not cnntlnnc lhcsc
s comments, I out or the

opinion that any noise is betterthan
no noise. Unfortunately, Darby
Gym is, more often than not, the
house that snores rattler titan the
house that roars. The days of the
“rat pack" are but fond memories.
It is ludicrous that the coach of an
exciting, ﬁrst»place team has to
exhortpeopletocome outand watch
his players perfonnr

Grinnell College sports fans are
a rare breed. The recent successes
enjoyed by a majority, rather titan a
minority, of the College‘s athletic
teams hasgiven us something about
which to yell. Any individual who
takes the time to acknowledge
Grinnell’s athletes. Mr. Hodum, is
it “good" fan.

ABSOLUTE 'I'Bll'l'ﬂ

In 20 Years, We'll Recall the
Semester of Love

By Carl Thelin and
John Paul Schmidt

In light of Joint Board’s recent
proclamation to the effect that this
semester is the Semester of Love.
we can only shake our heads with
sadnessaturecontentsoflaslweek's
Scarlet and Black. None of last
week's news stories, reviews,
opinion columns, etc., can justly
claim to have been suffused with
love, However, we must note that
the deadlines for submissions is
Tuesday, and the proclamation did
not occur until Wednesday night.
Therefore, those contributing to last
week‘s paper were, alas, unaware
of the revolutionary change being
initiated by Joint Board.

This week, on the other hand,
we anticipate a delightful
metamorphosis in the contents of
this publication. No more will we
finditemson theopinionpageﬁlled
with hate, slander, and woeful
misspellings. Insteadtherewillonly
be letters that offer encouragement,

support, and perhaps a wee bit of
tactful, understanding, and above
all constructive criticism.

But the Scarlet and Black will
not be the only focus for change
We believe, that from now 'on,
people will remove their laundry
from washers and dryers promptly,
and in those few instances when
this is not possible, others will
remove and fold it for them, There
will no longer be a mercilessly
imposed limit on the amount of
food that can be taken for a sack
lunchr Indeed,therewillbenoneed
for such a limit, for students will
take only what they need and leave
nothing but footprints. We also
think that no will make fun
of American Studies majors,
although perhaps our optimism has
gotten thebetterofusin that regard
This spring more flowers will
bloom, more birds will sing, and
fewer meteorites will hit cenual
campus.

For all of this to happen, we
need only to remember this: Love,
like pop rocks, is a way of life.

 

AGAINST THE GRAIN

Enviropanic: Problems
for Sale Peace by Peace

By Mike Kent

Remember the Music Man?
Good old Professor Harold Hill,
traveling salesman, cruises into
RiverCity. lowa and sells the city a
band. Of course, first he has to sell
them aproblem, for which theband
will be a solution. First sell a
community a problem, then sell
them a solution

Next week our campus will hear
a series of speakers address the
problem of “Global Warming".
This “problem”, discovered by a
certainDr. Hansen ofNASA, is the
result ofa thirty percent rise in the
concenuation of carbon dioxide in
the last hundred years, Hansen
predicts an additional 40 percent
rise by the year 2050. He assens
that this should cause an increase in
the temperature of the planet by
nine degrees farenheight

This nine degree increase would
cause the ice caps to melt.
subsequently causing major
ﬂooding of the coasts. Inland
droughtswouldalsoaccompanydtis
temperature increase.

A scary scenario to be sure.

Fortunately, or unfortunately
depending on your outlook, most
other respected climatologists and
atmospheric research groups have
refuted l-lanscn’s work as
scnsaiionii and ttlnrmist. The
National Oceanographic and

Atmospheric Administration, the
Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution, M.I.T., the University
of Virginia, the University of
Wisconsin, the Climate Trends
Panel (the 6i top climalologists in
thcworld).andevenotherelemcnts
ofNASA are all refuting Hansen’s
work. For Hansen'stheory to work,
the planet would have had to have
warn-rod 1.3»degrees Celsius in the
last hundred years. That figure
isn’t even close. The planet has
only warmed ,5 degrees C in the
last 100 years and most of that was
before 1938 prior to anybuild up of
carbon dioxide

In time, the “Greenhouse Effect"
will go the way of the Nuclear
Winter, the new ice age, the
depletion of fossil fuels. and the
population crisis. Each of these
has, in turn. enjoyed the spotlight
for a while, made a few
opportunistic scientists rich with
grants, then been passed on as not
as big a problem as they'd been
cracked up to be.

This time, however, the
environmental panic crowd has a
new audience. Concern for the
environment has come into vogue,
and everybody wants a piece of the
action. Groups like Greenpeace

whichever one of you clowns put
me on their mailing list) cxploil
