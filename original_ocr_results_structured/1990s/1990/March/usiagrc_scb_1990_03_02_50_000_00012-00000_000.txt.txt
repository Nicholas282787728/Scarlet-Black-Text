Dynasty
Begins at

it you‘ve ever walked
REC. Trophy Case, you can‘t
l‘elp but notice the plethora of
swimming trophies from the
Midwest Conference
Championship. As you read
this article, a hairless Grinnell
Men's Swim Team is in
Appleton, Wisconsin,
attempting to bring back yet
another first place Conference
Trophyt

This year‘s Conference

Meet, however, is unique For
the first time in 22 years, the
Buddha mascot will not make
the Lrip to Conference. Under
Buddha. the team won 12 of the
last 14 Conference titles, with
the exception of 1978 and 1987.
After banning Buddha as mascot
late last year, the team has
christened their new mascot just
in time for conference. The
"Mad Dog," which is actually a
Chinese statuette of a lion, will
attempt to give the Pioneers
their luck in this year‘s contest.

The Pioneers are going after
their third consecutive
Championship, after breaking
the Conference scoring record in
1983, and men re-breaking it in
1989. When Conch Ray
Obermiller was asked about the
chances of another record score.
he answered cautiously. “Last
year it was pretty obvious that
we would blow them out of the
water in the backstroke,
breastroke, and butterfly. ”this
year, we have similiar depth in
the squad, but it is more
concentrated in the freestyle
events. What we did last year
might never happen again,"
answered Obermilter.

Obermitler is conﬁdent that
the team will taper well for
Conference. Obermiller has
high hopes for the entire team
outlook, but believes some
individuals could break many
Conference records. “I tttink Joe
Zimsen, Mike Nield, Phil
Bishop, Dave Ressner, and the
relays all have shots at school
and Conference records in their
respective events,“ said
Obcrmiller.

What did the team think of
Mad Dog‘s debut at the

Conference meet‘.7 “I think it’s
refreshing, new and improved',”
commented Senior Iohn
Williams. Does Obermiller
have as much confidence in Mad
Dog as he does in his
swimmers? ”We’ll find out. I
think it's an original concept. I
think this will be a very
iteresting meet.” We can only
« that this is the beginning
rospcrous “Mad Dog",

Women's Basketball

Season Closes
With Tough'Loss

By Susan Thomas

Last weekend, the Grinnell

women‘s basketball season.

came to a close wtth a
heartbreaking loss to Lawrence,
53-50, in the conference
championship. Havingclinched
the south division title of the
Midwest Conference, the

, Pioneers traveled to Lawrence to

take on Lake Forest in the first
round of play-offs. After
soundly defeating Lake Forest.
8865, the team moved to the
ﬁnal game against Lawrence

In the opening game the
Pioneers “jumped on them"
early. pulling away to \a 34‘s
lead at the 10:13 mark. Coach
Eskildsen said of Lake Forest
after watching their warm-up.
“They were visibly cocky. and
not prepared for us,” He
accounted the early lead to the
Forcster's lack of preparation as
well as to Grinnelt’s
outstanding execution early in
the game. At the half, the score
was an insurmountable 56—24
due to 74% field goal shooting
and tough defense.

Scoring was yet again led by
senior Laura VanSickle and
junior Missy Sharer who netted
30 and 24 points respectively.
Sharer‘s effort included three
three»pointers as well as a
season-high 10 assists. The
Pioneers also outrebounded the

i Foresters 39-31 with senior

Amy Johnson. VanSickle, and
freshman Tera Iones grabbing
six apiece. Eskildsen also
congratulated Julie Kaster and
Jenny Wood for their
outstanding defensive effons.
The following day Grinnell
was placed against Lawrence in
a strong defensive struggle, In
the end. it was the Vikings who

came out on top, defeating the
Pioneers 53-50. At the half,
Grinnell posted an 11 point lead
which was slowly taken away as
Lawrence pulled ahead wiLh 4:56
remaining in the game. The
Pioneers held tough, and with
:14 seconds left, the score was
still a close 52-50.

Eskildsen commended the
team members on thetr effort
saying, “We didn’t play badly.
We executed well. In the clutch
situations, luck was just against
us. It was a solid team effort,
and we played as well as we
could in the situation We
couldn't catch a break."

Scoring was led one last
time by VanSickle who
accumulated 22 points followed
by Sharer with IS. Rebounding
was also led by VanSickle with
12, while Julie Kaster made a
strong contribution by pulling
down seven.

After turning a program that
was 5-l7 just three seasons ago
into a team that posted a 16-7
overall record, and a 9-3 mark in
conference, as well as claiming
a south division championship,
and a second place finish .in
conference, the Pioneers should
feel nothing but pride at their
effons,

Sure, a conference
championship would have been
the ultimate ﬁnishing touch on
a great season, but as Eskildsen ‘
put it, “The best is yet to come!
I am extremely proud of the
group and how proudly they
played all year. and that is
something that the entire
Grinnell community can be
proud of." And speaking of
pride, the team should also be
proud of Eskildsen who led
them through such a great
season.
