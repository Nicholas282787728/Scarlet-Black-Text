Actors Excel in Old Times

By Tara Neavins
and Kris Tapp

Zabrae Valentine, Kirsten
Pullen, and Mike Barr brought
Harold Pinter‘s play, Old Timer ,
to life Thrusday night in the-
Flanagan Arena Theatre, The
quaint stagework, music. candle-
light, and tho obviously well-
reherased actors came together to
create a very professional produc-
tion. The round theater compli-
mented the production enabling
the audience to feel like a part of
the reunion.

The play involved "Kate"
(Valentine) and "Deeley" (Barr), a
couple living in a secluded
English house whose isolated
lifestyle is threatened by the visit
of Kate's college friend, Anna

(Pullen), The conversation fol-
lowing Anna's arrival is inbedded
with subtle verbal warfare. laden
with hidden meaning, sexual
overtones, and subtle clues that
leave the audience wondering
about Kate's marriage with Mike
and the sexual tension between
Kate and Anna,

The actors were well-suited
for their respective roles and por-
trayed them with enlightened
realism, Valentine effectively
embodies Kate’s transition from
her stiffled, passive character at
the beginning of the play to her
powerful character at the end.
Pullen fervently exhibited Anna's
sophistication and strength, Barr
expressed the variety of emotions
invoked by his character as he
laughed with his wife, exploded

in rage at Anna, and wept in
Kate's lap,

The actors manipulated the
scenes with subtle retorts, facial
expressions, and well»placed
pauses which kept the audieee
intrigued. '

Portions of the production
were confusing as Pinter, not un-
like Ibsen or Beckett, intended.
Reading the program before the
play and recognizing the play's
sexual connotations and symbo-
lism, allows the viewer to more
thoroughly appreciate the pro-
duction. The final scene in
which Kate confronts Anna and
Deelcy about their symbolic
deaths was particularly well»acled
and memorable,

Bytchen Bands ‘

By Matt Baumann
and Colin Bucks

Tom Edison used to go
around the country clcctrocuting
dogs. Because he thought
alternating current was a Bad
Thing, that’s why.

Since then, we have found a
lot of other things to do with the
stuff. Like shaving, And
toasting. You can even get a
suntan with electricity. How
‘bout that?

There is one more thing
electricity is good for, and until
recently you had to con someone
into lending you their car to get
to Iowa City. There, they plug

guitars into Marshall amps, plug
the amps into the wall, and, well,
pretty much MOUNT AN
AURAL ASSAULT ON YOUR
TYMPANIC MEMBRANES,
You go deaf, Neat. kinda what
Tom did to the dogs (not the
band, the pet.)

But now, thanks largely to
Grinncll‘s visionary 3-2 program,
Grinnell students can experience
this in the “ID and guest pass
required" security of their own
back yard. Sort of. Saturday,
Feb. 24, at 8:30 (evening-time),
Iowa—based bands FULL
FATHOM FIVE, HOUSE OF
LARGE SIZES, and THAT
ANNOYING LI'I'I'LE ITCH (not
in that order) will, well, um,
they’ll do what they usually do in
places like Iowa City and
Columbia, Missouri and
Chicago, and the Cedar Falls
Public Library, only with less
beer. And books.

Full Fathom Five is 8 Iowa
City based “power trio“ who are
probably getting pretty darn tired
of being compared to Husker Du.
Fronted by guitarist/songwriter

that’s okay, because their songs
are big, they’re themes are big
(their most recent LP,
Multinational Pop
Conglomerate, had the first song
about ﬂagrburning of 1989), the
guitars of Melcher and Dave
Stephenson are big, and, let’s
face it, THEY’RE big. Sure, the
drummer, Doug Horncr, may
look small, but he's got big
glasses. As for their sound,
comparisons to the Hoover Dam
and this school‘s endowment
would not be out-of~line. in fact,
perhaps the only thing small
about this band is its label, Link
Records out of New York. But
this will soon change.

And while their name may
have you thinking otherwise,
“House of Large Sizes" is not, as
Matt’s mom put it, “a bunch of
fat guys." In fact, one of the guys
is a woman, bass player Barb
Schilf. Hailing from Cedar
Falls, Iowa (imagine that), the
House is a “trio of power." They
are the very best at what they do,
though we'll be damned if we can
tell you what that is. The fact is,
the House is a band of such, shall
we say “crunch," that they defy
generic description. The rhythm
section of Schilf and ‘drummer’
Dave Berg is more solid than the
Hoover Dam, which is good
because ‘guitar’ Dave Diebler is
the type-a-guy who sounds like
he’s about ready to “blow a hole
in the thing." Strong strong
STRONG guitar riffs and
whimsical lyrics combine with a
decidedly funkrdriven contentment
to produce not a wall, but
perhaps a barbedeirc fence of
sound, Hardly the bitter
alternative rock-n»roll stereotype,
the House has more than just a
vested interest in the Iowa music
scene, playing venues from the
Blue Note in Columbia to all—
ages at shows at the Public
Library in Cedar Falls, Their
second record, Healmirer, is due
out in March on Tuscon's Toxic
Shock Records.
