ARTS

Some 200,000 African-Americans served in the Union Army and Navy during the Civil War: about nine
percent of the total armed forces. Glory is an account of the 54th Massachusetts (Colored) Infantry. In
some ways, it is an old-fashioned war nlm. focusing on the personal growth and inter-relationships ofthe
soldiers,played faultlessly by Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington, MorganFrceman and others. But
the battle scenes are blunt and graphic, forcing us to search for the true “glory" in the soldiers' struggles
for dignity, equality and a share in the future of the nation that they are helping to create.

ISSUE: S&B
Speaks Out

continued from page l

ity, a key character of any newspa-
per. we must remain independent
of outside factions. And we deserve
campus support for daring to stand
against such pressures.

We don’t expect approval of ev-
erything we write, In fact, we wel-
come comments or criticisms.
However, we do not deserve to be
cornered in halls or classes by
people haggling over a negative
headline or a changed word in an
article.

Therefore, to raise these issues
ina way thatcannotbe ignored. we
have created a Special edition, a
simpliﬁed issue of the paper.

Within these four pages, the
Scarlemrtdﬂlackmorethan fulﬁlls
its obligations. Every advertise.
mentwe'vesolicited is inside. The
College Calendar, also an adver-
tisement, is included. For sports
and arts fans, recent scores and a
film box have been placed inside.
And we have summarized all the
recent news stories.

We realize that an informative
and entertaining newspaper should
be more than a brief capsulimtion

of evean. The features and opinion
pages, the long mm and concert

reviews, photos, in»dcpth news sto
ries, and differing viewpoints are
all qualities that reflect our efforts
L0 make the paper more titan just a
newsletter.

What we need is the support of
our readership to help us continue
this commitment to quality. We
need better equipment, better
working conditions and more re
spect from the campus.

By publishing this condensed
issue, we, thcstaffoftheScarlztand
Black, hopc’to generate more
awareness of the need of support
and understanding for our efforts.
We have not done this out of spite.
Next week we return to “normal"
because we are dedicated to pro-
vidtng tilts campus with informa-
tion, enlcnainment and a forum for
discussion.

We have proven the strength of
our commitment by voicing our
grievances in this manner. Now we
need our readers to examine our
argumentfairly and objectively. We
need a commitment from you.
