Volleyball Stuns
Iowa Wesleyan

Shiela Cain hoped for improve-
ment Only one of her starters left
last year. The time was ripe for a
big win. That big win came
Wednesday night versus iowa
Wesleyan University.

The Pioneer spikers routed a
taller, albeit slower IW team, 3-1.
Losing the ﬁrst game by a mere
three points did not portend a col-
lapse,asitmayhaveinrecentyws.
It meant playing harder, diving for
those hard-torreach hits and com-
ing up with some timely blocks.

In fact many found it amazing
that the Pioneers had lost the ﬁrst

game. Grinnell players simply
dominated from the opening serve,
only falling behind because of in-
opportune defensive lapses. Down
by as many as six or seven, the
Pioneers came back to tie gameone
at 13 before lW squeaked its only
win out

The rest was all Grinnell.

Several players shined for the
Pioneer team. Susan Egbert sewed
up some thunder that would feel
Steve Timmons, including an ace
to win game three, and an impres-
sive middle hitting display all-
around. loscelyn Keough mme up
with some timely stuff blocks
against hitters that make Karch
Kiralylookshorl(well,not—so-lall).
Setting duties were performed ade
mirably by Kathy Krttz and Amy
Robinson.

The attitude of the netters in
black is obviously moreupbeat and
more competettve. This attitude,
plus the improvement of many of
the starters, has helped revitalize

the volleyball program.
