Grinnell fields first ever

collegiate atlatl team

BY JOHN WITTAKER
Guest Writer

In another athletic first for
Grinnell College, five students and
Professor John Whittaker founded
the Grinnell Atlatl Team and
matched Gi-inneli's spear throwers
against competitors from all over
the United States during an event
held the weekend of October 11
and 12 at Cahokia, in Illinois, 4

“The event was great, as it of-
fered an opportunity to méet
people who are more seriously in-
volved in the sport. They were
exactly what I expected , . , forty
something anthropologist types,
rather eccentric, obviously paSr
sionate about their strange sport,"
said participant Liz Neerland,

Atlatls are prehistoric spear
throwers, the predecessors of the
bow and arrow. Essentially a stick
with a hook on one end, an atlatl
acts as a lever and extension ofthe
arm, and can propel a spear much
farther than the same‘arm unaided.
They were in use over much ofthe
prehistoric world, and into historic
times among such folk as the Inuiti
who used atlatls to throw harpoons
from kayaks, and the Aztecs, who
fought the Spanish With them.

Archaeologists are not the only
ones interested in atlatls: spear
throwing is a small and eccentric
but growing sport. The World
Atlatl Association was established
in 1987, and there are now several

To date the kickers are 7-8 over
all, 7,2 in conference, and are
looking to conclude their season by
defending their conference title.
All the players are excited and
poised for this opportunity and feel
that their chances to repeat are fa-
vorable,

“I think that we have a lot ofun-
fulfilled business to take care of in
conference," commented Coach
Jenny Wood, “Right now we feel
good and our attitudes are confi—
dent after a successful fall break."

Over the break the Ptonecis
competed against the University of
Chicago and fell, 2-0. However,
Wood was pleased with the team’s
performance because Chicago is
highly regarded throughout the
nation.

“They are a top notch team
which will be heading to the
NCAA D-III tourney and we
played well against them," said
Wood Our defense and goal tendr
mg was strong, and this match re-
ally helpcd build our confidence
[leading into this last week before

This confidence was evident in
the final conference game of the
regular season against Beloit. The
kickers were victorious, 1-0.

When classes began this fall,
enthusiasts were recruited from
the Archaeology of North America
class and elsewhere, and 12 stu—
dents made atlatls and began to
practice in September. Over the
weekend of October 11 and 12,

Greg Lind and Liz Necrland,
drove to Cahokia State Historic

In the shadow of the ancient
mounds of Cahokia the
Grinnellians took on a field of
some 40 atlatl ists, coming from as

far as Colorado, Wyoming, and

European style event (30 shots at

the arrowhead necklace for the top
female score.

The most prestigious event is

Men’s soccer team awaits

crucial makeup game

Sports Information

Weather was calling the shots
early this week as the Grinnell Col»
lege men's soccer team awaited a
chance to qualify for the fourrteam
Midwest Conference championship
tournament to be held in Ripon this
Saturday and Sunday, November 17
2.

' A crucial game with Monmouth
was postponed Sunday when a wet,
eight-inch snowstorm rendered
Ward Field unplayable. Coach John
Pﬁtsch, after investigating several

possibilities, still hoped to play the
match at Grinnell by Thursday if
melting and/or ﬁeld clearing permits.

If victorious over Monmouth, the
fourth-place Pioneers (5-3) will play
undefeated champion Ripon in the
ﬁrst round at 11 o'clock Saturday.
Beloit and St. Norbert, the No. 2 and
3 teams in the standings, will meet
in the other match. The winners will
meet for the title Sunday.

"Despite our inconsistency and
lack of goal production, we seem to
play tough against the Wisconsin

schools. We lost to Ripon here, 1-0»
in aclose one. Ofcourse itmay be a
jinx to talk about the playoff. We
still have to beat Monmouth and that
won’t be easy,“ commented Coach
Pﬁtsch.

During midrsemester break last
week the soccermen lost a pair of
non-conference games at Webster, 2-
l. and at Fontbonne, 2-0. Freshman
Justin Lea scored his ﬁrst goal in the
Webster outing. Coach Pfilsch said
his team did not play its best soccer
on the trip.

Volleyball squad slips
after mid-sem week

Already the “winilingest” volley
ball squad in school history, the
Grinnell College spikers have their
sights set on the home stretch lead-
ing to the Midwest Conference tour-
namellt Nov, 7- 8 at Lawrence.

able to the limited amount of prac-
tice time before and during mid-sem
exams. I still think we're a good
team. I‘d much rather have our ath-
letes do well in the classroom," said
Coach Tom Sonnichsen. “Things we
didn't do well are Correctable. We're
a good team when we pass the ball,
When ball control breaks down, we
struggle. We will gain by practice."
