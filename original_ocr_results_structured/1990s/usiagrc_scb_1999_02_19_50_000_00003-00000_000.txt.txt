The Lost Ritual of Dating

When i use the word “dating" I am re.
ferring to the level ofintimacy just after
mutual expression ofintorest and just prior
to commitment. Dating does not exist at
Grinnell Campus, and iryou will indulge
my pop psychology observations, iwill ex.
plain whyi think it remains an endangered
species.

Grinncll students feel crunched for
time, overextended and generally can’t te-
member the last time they were genuinely
bored (as opposed to boredom as a means
of procrastination from the work we

should all be doing). This has a Hemen» '

dous cfrect on relationships and dating at
Grinnell, at least it has for me.

so you're at a party (or a study group,
or study break, or computer lab) and you
meet someone, you really like this some-
one. You think that they like you too. The
two ofyou become portraits of sexual frus»
tration and desperate flirting.

This is not going to be a one night
hook up, you have genuine interest in their
mind and soul, but you don't know how
much interest, or how much respect, so
inevitably awcckend comes along and you
manage to blow olfall your homework and
spend most ofrheweckend with them. You
probably stayed up until 4 a.m. discuss-
ing The Symposium and how mudi Siﬂ
and Olly have sold out.

Younow have the choice to sleep with

Dirty Laundry: Do

I had no idea what to write about for
my first editorial in the prestigious Scar»
let and Black,_but I ﬁnally decided to
write about an issue that is important
to all of us. Not unless of course, you
have somehow escaped one of the basic
tenets ofAmerican socialization: LAUNe
DRY.

What is laundry? Laundry is all of
the clothing that must be washed either
after wearing them once (like underwear
and socks) or after wearing them on
several occasions (like jeans and T—
shirts), not unless you are meticulous.

Who does laundry? Most people do
their own laundry here, unless they have
a maid on call or a parentwith extra time
that takes in a collection,

Why do the laundry? Simple. To pre-
vent the gtowth ofa stench.

When does one do laundry? At vari-
ous times that are convenient for our
busy lives. However, here at Grinnell, it
seems that the most convenient time for
everyone is after 5 pm. on Friday and
Saturday and in the morning on satur—
day and Sunday.

Where do we do laundry? Well, some
folks wash delicate items in the bath-
room sinks. Unless you live offcampus,
the other items are washed at any ofthe
various luxury, high-grade laundry facili»
ties that we have in the basements ofour
ﬁve star residence halls. Now, we arrive
at the most important,qucstion ofall,

How do we do laundry? Of course,
many people think that they have the
answer, but from the looks of the laun-

that while this is normal, even expected

true. (Mountains of bright and dingy
clothing are always strewn on the tops
of the washing machines, dryers and
floor. Wet or dry. Folded or unfolded.
Some items have been there for seconds,
minutes, or days. Now, we all knowthat
if this was a real laundromat in a high
crime area that these clothes would be
gone in a few seconds and put to better
use, without a caterul eye watching over
them, Right? Anyway, be thankful that
we are in crinnell . . . ) Although, all
Grinnellians are supposed to be the

missing a few kernels. (know what i

There are ten basic steps to success»

into two main piles oiwhites and col-
ors. if necessary, make “subepiles" of
delicate and miscellaneous items.
Watch out for the “dry clean only" tag.
4, Put each pile and "sub-pile” in separ
rate machines, hopefully not taking up
more than three at a time, with an ad—

5. Turn the dial to the right setting.

Tren’r Lol’r:
| Did No’r Inhale

BY TOR JANSON

Now that the impeachment trial is over, some people are probably hoping that politi-
cians everywhere will take a break trom the ridiculous sort ofarguments Bill Clinton is now
famous for, it, “I had a joint, but i did not inhale" or “I did not have sexual relations with
that woman, according to my deﬁnition ofsexual relations." As it turns out, Trent Lott has
proven he is more than ready to pick up where Clinton left off. in recent weeks, it has
become clear that he has many connectionswith an organization called the Cour. il ofCon—
setvarivc Citizens (C of CC). Hc.has been photographed with their leaders, he has given
numerous speeches at their meetings and just last November hewas mentioned as a member
by Mississippi’s largest newspaper without challenge from his office. He is listed as an ant
dorscr oftbe organization in their literature and his widely distributed newspaper column is
a regular reatutc orthe C ofCC’s publication, "The Citizen’s Informer."

So what's wrong with Trent Lott rubbing elbows with the council ofconservativc Citi-
rens2 They haw: members in 22 states, including senator iesse Helms, Governor Fordicc of
Mississippi and more than 20 members orthe Mississippi state Legislature. well, according
to the southern poverty Law Center, the C ofCC is a white supremacist organization, it is
the modern day incarnation ofthe white Citizen Councils ofthe 505 and 605.

Termed by some the “whitetcollar Ku Klux Klan," the infamous Citizen Councils were
formed in reaction to the brown vs. the Board ofEducation ruling by the Supreme Court.
These councils were composed ofbusiness and civic leaders committed to enforcing segregae
tion in the south. While one of their members murdered civil rights leader Medgar Even,
the white Citizen Councils tended to avoid outright violence. They prererred to enforce
racism and hate through politics and outer institutional means such as boycotting black
businesses.

one need not focus on their past to ﬁnd racism within the C ofCC, Today they claim to
be concerned with a wide range orconservarive issues, yet according to the Southern poverty
Law Center their publications deal primarily with race, including justifications for white
supremacy.

Senator torts initial reaction to accusations that he is a member of the C of CC was to
deny membership and claim that he had “no first-hand knowledge of the groups views,”
Again, Trent Lott, majority leader of the us senate, has given keynote addresses at C ofCC
meetings, but he claims he has “no ﬁrsthand knowledge ofthe group's views." in cffecr, he
is saying, “I was there, but I did not inhale." lately he has added to his defense that “I have
made my condemnation of the white supremacist and racist views or this group, or any
group... Any use ofmy name to publicize dreir view is not only unauthorized_ it’swrong."
Despite this claim, however, Lott has yet to outright condemn the C orcc, and he has not,
thus rat, supported a measure to express Congressional condemnation of the C orccs racist
views. Furthermore, irTrent Lott does not tolerare racist groups using his name, why has his
other allowed the C mm to list him as an endorser for years?

The c ofCC, meanwhile, is claiming that dreir organization is being wrongly slandered
by the liberal media and the liberal Southern Poverty Law Center, which is ramous tor in
lawsuits against the Ku Klux Klan. Their leader, Gordon Baum, claims that they support
issues that the majority of Americans support: limiting immigration, ending afﬁrmative
action, protecting the Constitution and fighting forced busing. “None ofour literature or
website material is supremacist," he said in a press release.

I decided to take Mr. Baum up on his claim. I visited the website. See ifany orthis sturf
sounds supremacist to you:

About Archbishop Desmond Tutu, South African Nobel Prize winner and recent speaker
in lowa City. “Tutu now sits in judgment on the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
handing out clemency to black rapists and murderers as he speaks a white mans language,
adorns himselrin clothes and jewelry manufactured by white technology, pretends to be a
leader ofa white religion and brags about his miraculous cancer treatment, made possible by
white science. He should be getting on his knees and thanking God daily for the white man
and the blessings brought to South Africa bywhite civilization, including his own education
at white universities," .

About muted race marriage. not only should one guard against the notion or race
mixing but guard as well against its ultimate aim, the mixing orwhat is right, good, and
wholesome with that which is not."

AboutAmerican cities: “Visit any neighborhood in any ciry in this nation that was built
and populated by a white population which has since been supplanted by a non—white popu.
lanon. In just a few years, safe streets have turned into shooting galleries. Excellent schools
have become the worst schools in these cities. The quality orlire has fallen to third and
fourth world levels, These neighborhoods and their fall from grace is a result orthe genotype
change. Whites build and live according to what their genes dictate. Non-whites build and
live according to what their genes dictate."

About immigration: “Because the third world immigrants are coming here by the
millions..,Btinging their take religions with them. Bringing their inferiorcultures. speaking
a separate language setting us up as a new TowereafeBabel nation, and threatening to swamp
out Anglo-Saxon society and culture that we have that has been erected for us by our rorcra.
thers."

I could go on, but this column is already too long. lithe above wasn't enough for you,
visit their website.

What is scary about all this is that these quotes did not come from the Klan or a small
group or fanatics living in rural bunkers. The governor or Mississippi is a member, Trent
Lott, at the very least, has courted this organization tor votes. At worst, he may be a dues
paying member? The Council ofConservative Citizens is where outright racism and institu.
tional racism comes to a head. Last week, during the symposiums and lectures on campus
about afhrmative action, itwas emphasized that opponents ofaﬂirmative action believe that
race discrimination is largely absent from our society, with the exception ofa few fanatics.
The Council or Conservative Citizens serves as a joking reminder that not only is blatant
racism alive and well in America, but it continues to infiltrate the most powerful political
ofﬁces ofour nation.

Dear Editor,

As a student supervisor at Cowles Din-
ing Hall. I wisk to apologize ifyou have en.
countered a time when you had to wait a
few minutes for somethingto be restocked
to your liking during a meal.

we at Cowles currently have over 90 va.
cant slotson our student schedule, which
places a greatamount ofstresson the rector
the team. it is kind oflike sending only two
basketball players, or ﬁve football players,
or foursoftball players onto the playing ﬁrld.
we continue to play the game three times a
day, seven days a week and we play hard (for
you the students) to win your approval. As
one of the team captains, I would love to
have 50-60 more team players (like you!) so
that it would be much easier for us to win
some games for you, Thank you.

Lyle Bauman

Dear Editor,

lwould like to take a moment to spologize

inghallwithoutpayingAldroughcotnmonly
referred to as"sneaking into Quad," this act is
actually their, a cnme which is never right,
even ifit as small as n dining hall meal.

lwould hope that the campus can forgive
me for degrading the moral fabric or our
school and i would also like to encourage
other students to think before theystenl from
campus.

just remember: when you steal, you my
drink you are gninmgsomething, but you are
really being stolen of your own moral dig
nity, one ofour most important assets, lrne
plicit in my npologyis a promise never to steal
from the school again, and I hope each and
every student crnalso make this promise to
the college, with much sincerity, Thank you.
