In pauolling this campus, the

Editorial
Grinnell Police Department is

merely doing its job of maintaining public safety and protecting the rights
of its citizens. These police patrols are an important, preventive measure
and, as such, are in the best interest of all students.

They are the result of several sexual assaults. reports of suspicious
people on campus and a rash of thefts in the dorms last year. However.
there have been complaints that the police are an intimidating presence in
areas like the loggias, especially in lightof the new alcohol policy.

Such complaints are unfounded, though, especially since police seem
to be enforcing alcohol policy laws. There seems to be a notion that it is
a student's right to consume alcohol here at Grinnell. On the contrary, it
has been a privilege granted by the administration.

By state law, people under 21 years of age should not consume or
possess alcohol, and those whoare of legaldi-inking age and conform with
other alcohol-related laws should have nothing to fear. The only reason
students might feel intimidated is irutcy were breaking the law.

Some would argue. however. that these patrols inhibit the college's
principle of self-governance. But self-govemance docsn 't mean students
are exempt from answering to the law. The police are not here to replace
the college‘sjudicial system. Their purpose is to maintain student safety.

But if in the course of patrolling tlle campus, a police ofﬁcer comes
across a student who is breaking the law (e.gr underaged drintdng), then
that ofﬁcer must enforce the law and take proper action. In other words,
the police are here for the beneﬁt of the students, but it is also their duty
to uphold the law if someone is in violation of it

Those who might break the law have a choice: Don't, or watch ouL

I ntimidating Force
Not Necessary

Though the college‘s interest in
promoting saltey for students at
Grinnell is legitimate, the invitation of an increased police presence on
campus is not necessary to achieve this end The campus community
would be wise to evaluate the potentially negative impact of such a
presence on the autonomy of its student government system.

Grinnell students are continually encouraged to utilize the college's
judicial system in favor of involving the police in cases of theft. problem
drinking and harassment, because this is a better and more effective way
of dealing with campus problems The introduction of an outside police
influence interferes with this atmosphere of self»govemance.

The police‘s appearance also comes at a time when some students are
trying to adjust to the new alcohol policy and town ordinance. both
imposed on them by forces outside college control. Some students are
unwilling to invite yet another external control on campus life.

Also, because both the alcohol policy and town ordinance are intended
to preventalcohol consumption. thepolice’sproponed primary interestin
issues of safety becomes questionable. Why. it their concern is safety. are
they patrolling the well-lit areas of campus, like the loggias'.7 And why,
when most threats to Grinnell students’ safety seem to occur in town,
aren‘t tltey concentrating on the area between town and campus?

The night Watchmen could be a more effective safety resource for the
campus community. If they were trained to perform duties which would
concentrate on the sighting, and possible apprehension. of unwelcomed
visitors, they could serveas campus police. This would have the effect of
promoting safety, while at the same time preserving the atmosphere of
self—govemance thatenhances both educational and social life at Grinnell.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
HowWe Will Keep You Informed

Although there was not a
standing—room-only crowd, last
week’s Open Forum on student
apathy was well attended. Alot of
fruitful discussion took place Not
surprisingly, some felt that SGA
should make great(er) efforts to
communicate more with students
and show them that we exist

Thatisperhapstheoneconsistent
criticism of SGA. Yet, in the past
three years. SGA has made great
effons to communicate with the
students.

For one, there is a iii—weekly
SGA column in the Scarlet and
Black. Hopefully,whatlwrite will
transcend the items discussed in the
senators’ minutes. I would like to
elaborateaboutwhatpeopleinSGA
are thinking about, what they are
anticipating and the patterns they
see developing in the student body,

Some say thaLSGA should do
more than that. that SGA should
foster discussion (a constitutional

mandate. by the way). Therefore,
SGA is sponsoring Open Forums
onissuesthatseemtobeconceming
students. We have had three
already.

Otherssay that is still notenough.
Therefore, though I am only
required to hold four ofﬁce hours a
week,l’m holding 14 hours [will
be in my office every day but
Saturday. Studenm can speak with
me justabouteverydayof theweek
if they so choose. Nobody can say
that I'm notavailable.

Of course. for some that is still
not enough because they think that
the SGA offices are too far out of
the way Though we cannot
realistically go door to door to
accomodate for this inconvenience,
we can do the next best thing.

In late October or early
November, for a two and one—half
week period. I will personally be in
a different dorm every night from
6:30 to 7:00-7:30. along with

Pedro
Fernandez-
McCarthy

whatever Cabinet members can
make it. that day, to conductan SGA
studybreak. Hopefully the dorm
senatorts) will also be there Itwill
be informal, and people can just
pop on by in theirlounge and talk to
us or ask questions. I imagine that
people will feel more comfonable
bringing up subjects in this context
that they would otherwise never
bring up in the much more formal
setting of a Joint Board session, for
example If itprovcs tobeasuccess,
I’ll do it twice next semester.
