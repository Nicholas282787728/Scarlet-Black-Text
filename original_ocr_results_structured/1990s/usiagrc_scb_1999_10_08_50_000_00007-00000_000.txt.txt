As a resulr ofhis eonraer wirh

also emphasized rhar many crimir

Pisron admirred ro having some
reservanons before beginning his
inrernship.

“I didn’t wanr ro pur murder—

However, personal eonracr wirh

and Piston soon realized rhar rhe
job involved “lots ofhard academic
work and research 7 ir wasn't iusr
making impassioned speechcs.”

The inrernship also influenced
his views on she deada penalry.

“There are lors oireasons ro he
againsr rhe dearh penalry as ir
srands," said Pismn, noring irs
prejudieal slanr and high financial

“Those who race the dearh pen-

and poor," he said, “and she erire-
ria for facing me dearh penalry are
very, very small. It’s hard so sepa-
rare our rhe effeers of race and

“The more i gor ro knowrhem
