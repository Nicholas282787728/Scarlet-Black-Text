Underdressed Students Mistake
Terminal Room for Sauna

By Garrett Delavau
& Scott Samuelson

NE student and two profcsr
0 sets allege that two uniden-
tified students entered the
Carnegie terminal room lnte Saturr
duy,February 27,cladonlyin towels.
andremainedthorc forapproximately
ten minutes.

Tim Corkery said he was work-
ing late in the unusually balmy com-
puter lab when two male students
entered the room wearing overcoals.
After removing the coats, the two
towel-clad men proceeded to situpon
the computer tables, leaning forward
in a saunarlikc position. Corkery
added that the two students were“ob—
viously naked" except for the towels.

“At first I thought it was some
kind of prank," said Corkery, “but

either they were completely dead
pan. or they seriously thought this
was a sauna or something."

Mr. and Mrs. Hughes, two clas-
sics professors, also witnessed the
event. They were lingering tn

the Red Lantern, and happened by
the cotnputer lab.

“They were obviously lost, but
I’mpretty surcthatLheyweren’tthere
just to log on.” said Lisa Hughes.
“Dennis thought it might be some
kind of frat initiation.” (Nate: Frar

According to Corkcry, the room
wasabnormally hotthatnight.“l'ma
guy who likes a nice warm computer
room, but this was the hottest I’ve
ever seen it.” After ten minutes or so,
the students picked up the coats and
left, looking “a little sweaty.” said
Corkery.

Presidentelect Finke, who does not take office
until September of 1993, plans to become involved
with SGA immediately. he Said.

“This semester, I’m going to start working on
building the cabinet," he said. “I wantto get people to

 

here and are excited about
getting involved in activities, but then it’s like a slap
in the face when they learn that they have to wait a
semester to get involved with SGA. I think that
incoming freshmen could do a very good job as
senators.”

The ability to relate to students, not previous
SGA experience, is what makes a president good,
according to Finke.
