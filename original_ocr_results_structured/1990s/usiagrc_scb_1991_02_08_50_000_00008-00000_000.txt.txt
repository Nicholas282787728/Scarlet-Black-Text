Bicycle Thief steals audience
attention With brutal realism

By Brett Fechheimer

Ari impoverished man,
living amidst the squalor and con-
fusion of Rome in the years imme—
dialely following World War II,
has his bicycle stolen. Because he
desperately needs the bicycle for
his new job, the man. Antonio
(Lamberto Maggiorani) and his
young son, Bruno (Enzo Staiola)
spend a frustrating day frantically
searching the streets of Rome for
the bicycle and the thief who slole
it.

Searching for a stolen bir
cycle probably doesn’tsound like a
grippingideafora90minutemovie
(tell that to Pee-Wee Herman), but
this is the plot of the highly-ac-
claimed 1948 film The Bicycle
Thief— an engrossing, even excitr
ing, motion picture.

The film’s director.
Vittorio De Sica, transcended the
limitations of a simple story, cre-
ating a ﬁlm which strikes a univer-

sal chord. Upon watching Antonio
and Bruno search everywhere for
the stolen bicycle, the viewer expe-
riences the same barrage of cmo-
tions and sentiments as felt by the
main characters, including frustra-
tion, disgust at the heartlessncss of
the thief, and a cmshing feeling of
isolation in a complex and over
whelming world.

However, although it is
heart-wrenching, this film is not
unduly depressing. There are hu-
morous. often compassionate
scenes sprinkled throughout Thief.

Thismovieisalsointrigu-
ing because of its brutal realism.
Although it is‘consistently wellr
acted. very few of the actors in this
film are professionals. It is the near
“documentary quality“ of this
classic that helps one to identify so
easily with its story.

The Bicycle Thief will be
shown on Saturday at 8:30pm in
North Lounge.
