Cable Installation
Finally completed
After long wait

TCI only buried cables lastfall;
Installation completed over break

By Howard B Horn

Grinnell College has finally

been connected to the world
of CNN, MTV, and Court TV
through cable television.

Last Friday, TCI Cable fin—
ished installing cable T.V. on
campus. This was much later
than the original completion date
of fall break. The late installa-
tion was due to a mix-up between
TCI Cable and Student Affairs.
TCI did not make it clear that
they were only going to bury
cables in October (before the
ground froze), and not complete
installation.

According to Tom Crady,
Dean of Student Affairs, there
has been a demand for cable on
this campus since he started

IT took half ofa semester, but

working on this campus in 1982.
Interest waned for a while until
recently. “When [the need for
cable T.V. on campus] really hit
me was during the Gulf War.“
Crady explained. “It was pretty
hard to get information on cam-
pus, and students were complain-
ing."

All of the criticism received
by Student Affairs about cable
T.V. has been positive. Crady
believes that through cable T.V.,
“students will be more informed
about world events." He also
thinks that students will act rer
sponsibly and not watch MTV all
day.

The connection of Grinnell
to cable T.V. still has a few bugs.
Several dorms have televisions
that are not cable»ready. In order
to rectify this, Student Affairs is
working on acquiring cable
boxes.
