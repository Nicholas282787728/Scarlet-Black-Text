Consultant picks Iowa Interstate
as best option for passenger line

A Massachusetts consulting ﬁrm is
recommending that the Iowa Interstate
Railroad route be used for a new pas»
seriger system that would begin opera-
tions In 2006.

Grinnell is located along the route,
but initial plans do not call for stops
here,

Nor is the nine-state Midwest pas-
senger system a sure thing. At a news
conference held inAmes Monday, Iowa
Department of Transportation Direc-
tor Darrel Rensink said state officials
will have to take a long look at the
proposal.

“Now that we know a Midwest re-
gional rail system is feasible, we need
to ﬁnd out Whetherit’s right for Iowa,”
Rensink said. “While a new and en-
hanced rail passenger servrce might be
a good investment for some states,
we‘re not sure how beneﬁcial it would
be for Iowa."

Other routes studied

The consulting ﬁrm, Transportation
EconomicsandManagementSystems,
Inc., of Cambridge, Mass, studied two
other routes in Iowa:

- The Burlington Northcm-Santa Fe,
which is currently used by Amtrak and
runs through such Iowa communities
as Burlington, Mount Pleasant,
Osceola, Cteston and Ottumwa, con~
necting Chicago and Omaha.

' The Union Pacific, a 49l-mile-
long route through Iowa that also cone
nects Chicago and Omaha and runs
through Cedar Rapids, Marshalltown
and Ames. ‘

However, the consultant concluded
that the Iowa Interstate route, a 479-
mile stretch of tracks in Iowa, would

have the most potential riders and
would generate the most revenue 7
$25 million annually,

The route also would have the iOWr
est operating cost per year at $40.4
million. although it would have a high
infrastructure cost of$l97 million.

Population centers

The consultant’s analysis suggests
that the development ofthe Iowa Inter»
state route is the most effective option
with the highest net present value and
the highest numberof riders, because it
serves the most densely populated re
gions in the state: the Quad Cities,
Iowa City and Des Moines.

Under the plan, the train, running at
speeds of up to 110 mph, would not
stop in Grinnell. It would stop in New-
ton and Iowa City, however.

The consultant recommended that
the route be served by modern diesel
multiple-unit train technology.

Under the plan, the Midwest system
would include service to such metror
politan areas as Minneapolis-St, Paul,
Minn.;GreenBay, Wis.;Detroit, Grand
Rapids/Holland and Port Huron, Mich.;
Cleveland and Cincinnati, Ohio;
Carbondale, Chicago and Quincy, 111.;
St. Louis and Kansas City, Mo.; Omaha
and Des Moines.

Bus system for passengers

A feeder bus system would sup-
plement the passenger rail service to
provide service to communities for
which rail is not currently an option.

However, challenges facing such a
system are considerable. according to
the Massachusetts firm. They include
the taskofsecuring federal, state, local

 

 

 

 

Stories aboundaboutthatfrrstdayof
school, but Around’s favorite this year
concerns a trusting kindergarten stun
dent at Bailey Park School in Grinnell.

This sweet happy child was sched-
uled to ride the bus at the end of the
school day to the aﬂer-school program
atDavisSchool,Obligingly,heelimbed
on the bus and rode to Davis School
which he somehow did not realize was
where he was supposed to get off.

So on he went on the bus’s route to
Grinnell Middle School where whom
should he meet but his surprised older
brother who was scheduled to ride the
bus back to Bailey School from where
he would walk the short distance to
their home.

The older brothertook charge at this
pointand,backatBalley,presented his
younger siblingto the folks there who,
confronted with the misplaced student,
quickly rose to the challenge and ar-
ranged transportation for the young-
ster to Davis where he belonged.

Not at all non-plussed, the kinder-
gartner took it all in stride and en-
thused to his mother about his activi-
ticsofthe day and how he lovcdschool.

How adaptable children are these
days!

A large tube-shaped package which
arrived Friday at the ofﬁce ofthe Her-
aid-Register proved to bean immense
map of the world from the National
Geographic Society wrth the message
that was for the newsroom and that
every school in the United States was
to receivc a duplicate ofthe map.

Each school In the area will receive
one oftlic maps in the next few days as
a millennial gift to the nation from the
National Geographic Society,the mes-
sage continues, so that all 113,000
schools in the United States now will
have the same standard uprto-date map
of the world.

The 4x6rfoot map IS a tough lame
iiiatcd tworsidcd one with one side
depicting the political world as ofJune,
1998, and the othcra digital picture of

the physical world based on images-

colleetcd by satellite.

The map also celebrates the IOtlr
anniversary ofthe establishment of
the NalIOnnl Geographic Society Edur
cation Foundation which was formed
that long ago when It became apparent
that knowledge of geography had dc-
elined notably in the United States, at

least partly because ofworld-wide po-
litical processes, and the society took it
upon itselfto do something about it.

The society has invested more than
$100 million, it points out, has trained
more than I I,.500 teachers and estab»
lished geographic alliances in every
state in the nation, the District of Co-
lumbia, Puerto Rico and Canada.

It also sponsors thcpopularNational
Geography Bee, a nationwide camper
tition in which nearly 5 million stu~
dents take part each year,

Cooperating with the geographic
societyinthe project are fourofwhatit
terms Millenium Partners: The Ameri-
can Plastics Council, Subaru of
America, Eastman Kodak Co and State
Farm Insurance Companies.

So the next time you visit a school,
look for this tremendous new map?
but also prepare to upgrade you own
knowledge of geography.

Something to look forward to, as far
forward, in fact, as the year 2004: The
minting of an Iowa quarter!

The quarter will have the traditional
GeorgeWaslIington'auston the “heads"
side and a design representing the state
oflowa on the “tails" side,

What that design will be is up to
whomever is governor in the year 2002,
the year the design process will begin.
Either the governor or a committee
appointed by the governor will come
up with halfa dozen ideas for the logo.

The only restriction is that the Iowa
logo on the reverse side of the coin
cannot be another bust.

Ideas selected from the proposals
will go to the United States Treasury
Department which will choose three
and create formal designs for them.
The three choices then will go back to
thegovernorforselection,andthc ﬁnal
choice will be made by the United
States Treasurer.

Five states a year will have a quarter
minted with their logo each ycar from
l999through 2009,ﬁrstintlicordcrof

the United States, then in the order of
their admission to the union,

somewhat farther down the line, it will

Will seek comment

In lowa,tlie next step will be to seek
public comment on the results of the

with representatives frorri the Iowa
communities along the Chicago-to»

will exploreﬁnancingoptionsandseek
more detailed cost estimates through
another study with tlrc other Midwest
states.

Other highlights of the report:

- The system would require a capital

investment of $3.5 billion for rolling
stock, track and grade crossing im-
provements, modern signals and con-
ti'ol systems, maintenance faciliticsand
station improvements.

- Eighty percent of the Midwest
population would be within a one-hour
drive ofa station or feeder bus connec—
tron,

- By 2020,fouryears afterfull impler
mentatron, the system would attract 8
million passengers.

~ All ciglit corridors in the system
would achieve positive operating cost
ratios aftertlietwo-yearstartupperiod.

- The plan calls for a 328-car ﬂeet
system and renovation ofthe existing
stations.

- New trains would offer amenities
such as food services, advanced com-
Inunicatloiis and other business sup-
port facilities, as well as audio»vidco
monitors at seats for news, entertain
meritandinforinatronalprogramming.

- The plan recommends initial ser—
vice of the line from Chicago to the
Quad cities area by 2003, Quad Cities
to DesMoines by 2005 andDes Moines
to Omaha by 2006.

Grinnell is selected
for roadway effort

Grinnell is one ofl} communitiesin
Iowa selected to participate in the
Iowa’s Living Roadways Community
Visioning Program,

The program is designed to serve
lowa communities with population
under 10,000,

Objectives of the program are to
assist community volunteers in mak-
inget'fectivcdecisionsaboutroadsrdes
and related landscapes; to blend envi—
ronmental stewardship with commu-
nity-rmprovertrent projects; and to use
professional landscape architectural
designserviecstoerihaneecommunrty
ideas.

The program is sponsored by the
Iowa Department of Transportation
Iowa'sLivingRoadwayTrustFund,in
partnership with Trces Forever and
Iowa State University Landscape Ar-
chitecture Extension.

According to Trees Forever spokes-
man Mike Tidmari, the process on-

courages visionary and strategic think-
ing about landscape improvements in
each community.

“A conceptual landscape plan is the
centerpiece of the process, reﬂecting
the vision of the community leaders
and volunteers," Tidman said.

Participants follow these steps:

,- Assessment oflocal natural, culr
tural and esthetie landscape resources.

- Identification and prioritizing of
community needs

' Development ofa community con—
cept.

- Detemiination of potential funding
sources for implementing the plan.

~ Beginning the ﬁrst phase ofland-
scape development.

At the conclusion of the program,
drawings and picrures describing the
concept designs and action plan will

Consultant makes the
right choice on rail service

Considerable work remains to be done before Iowans can start making

plans to board a Ioormpli passenger train along the Iowa Interstate Railroad
route. Indeed, there’s no guarantee the project will every come to fruition.
But a Massachusettsbased consultant made some powerful arguments
Monday in favor of augmenting passenger service in the state. It chose the
rorrte that would scrvc the most people and be the most accessible for those
using feeder buses or other links to depots in the communities served by the
trains.

Grinnell, however, is going to have to do some serious lobbying ifil hopes
to have trains stopping here, rather than Zipping through town without
allowing passengers to board or get off. The plans unveiled by Transporta-
tion Economics and Management Systems of Cambridge doesn't call for
stops in Grinnell, although the twins would serve nearby Newton.

A strong argument can be made for Grinnell, however. There are people
who commute to Grinnell from Des Morncs and Iowa City. When Grinnell
College IS in session, the trains would get heavy use by students heading for
Des Moines International Aii'pon And plenty of people would be happy to
board a relatively lttghrspccd train to conduct business in other cities along
the rolitc.

It’s not too soon to be thinking
about the lobbying effort.

But there ‘tII’C plcnty ofqucstioirs
that still have to be answered. The
constiltlint’s report doesn't just
focus on town, The now passenger
system would cover a ninc- ale
riicn So it would require close

cooperation between planners in lill ol’tho. tires, and it would mean raising

Steve and Sheri Peters, formchrinr

Regular visits to family members
and friends are cxcusc enough, but
Steve always had wanted a Chevy, a
1957 Chevrolet Bel Airtwodoor hard
top. In April, I997, he ﬁnally ioundthe
one and it will be entered again this
year in the car show in the “unfin-
ished“ category because of body and
cosmetic work still needed.

Last year the car was brorrglrt to
Grinnell by trarlci' from Scdalia, M0,,
because it was not yet mechanically
sound enough for the drive.

This year, however, because Iiiost of
