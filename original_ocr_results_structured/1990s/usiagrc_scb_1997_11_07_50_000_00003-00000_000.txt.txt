His story It riothrtig short ofnmaze

cal gang. Hill had been shot and sent
to prison, which gave him the time
to reassess his lifestyle and liveli—
hood. The details-of his revelation

“Nor do people put new
wine into old wineskins; if
they do, the skins burst, and
then the wine runs out and
the skins are ruined they

but are based heavily on the power
of the Bible and the word of the Lord.
With guidance from God, Hill man-
aged to change his outlook on life
and ﬁnd a new callingl both helpful
to others and moral in nature. As

LW: So tell me, what‘s behind
the name “Schadenfreude"?

Liesel: “Schadenfreude" is of
course a German word for taking
pleasure in others' misfortunes.

Inga: Can we say we were ﬁlling
out the application at Quad two min
utes before it was due?

Liesel: I guess we could say that.
Also, we like to mock people.

LW: What kind of music do you
guys play?

Liesel: It's very bipolar. Inga once
played Devo playing a cover of “(I
can‘t get no) Satisfaction."

Inga: Arid Liesel tends to play
these songs that are really depress-
ing, and after three or four minutes I
have to ask her if she‘s going to do
anything after that.

Liesel: They‘re not all depressing.
i really like the Throwing Muses and
we both like the Smiths. I really like
Joy Division. I like Pink Floyd a lot
and the Geraldine Fibbers.

Inga: [like the basic “alternative"
stuff. But I'll throw in anything that
sounds funny' or Interesting. Like a
little ska, a little classical, bad Chi»
nese pop, anything.

Liesel: This is my third radio
show. I had one called “Delicate Cut—
ters: Music for the Mind." It had
more of a hippyish, Grateful Dead-
type slant. 1 think that our show is
more bizarre.

Inga: I‘ll take that as a compli~
ment, though I‘m not sure you meant
it that way. ,

Liesel: Well, your music is strange
and my music is strange, too.

Inga: Probably the best part of the
show is that we have a weekly poll,
kind of like how in Heather: they
have a lunchtime poll.

Liese120ne of our questions was
“How often does the average south
campus dweller shower each week?"
But nobody called in.

Jeremy goes to the

he began to preach to the gang nicme
bets he had known, and his Words
rang true for some. Hill was offered
an ofﬁce with a local church and be
came a pastor, and he continues to
this day to help those trapped In gang

no expectation of payment,

itig his message is all be ex-

The group namc New
Wine Skins is taken from a
Christian parable (Matthew
9:17):
new wine into old WmBT
skins; if they do, the skins
burst, and then the write runs out arid
the skins are ruined. No, they ptit
new wine intofresh skins; then both
are preserved.”

Tonight’s performance should be
both an educational and an entertaine
ing experience, especially for those
students who believe Snoop Doggy
Dog and Dr. Dre are real original
gangsters.

Inga: Then there was this big den
bate over the Your Mamajokes when
we had a total of one caller.

Liesel: Once someone called us
and told us we sucked. Theli some
one called us and told us we were
doing a goodiob, We take all kinds
of criticism. V

LW: What’s the best thing about
having a radio show?

Inga: The power and the glory

Liesel: We like to shape the
masses,

Inga: We might have picked a bet-
ter time.

Liesel: Yeah, I’m about as reliable
as a piece of cheese. And sometimes
by the end of a stiturday night. I’m
totally incompetent. But we love the
gynL

LW: Is there anything that
you’d like yourlisteners to know
about you?

Liesel: That We’re out to steal their
souls and sell them to Marilyn
Manson.

Inga: OK, I’m ior that I guess.

Liesel‘ Our favorite PSA is the
shower PSA. And at the beginning
of the semester we plastered the cam-
pii's with really amusing signs but
they all got taken down. What did
they say'.7

Inga: “There will be no more ice
cream cones; there will only be ptiin.“

Liesel: “Because they are all has
lard packets."

Inga' “Because it’s all bad except
for when it isn’t " "Because we live
in a monastery,"

Liesel: We both developed this
theory that this place is like a mon»
astery because we work all the time
and there‘s not much sunlight,

Inga: We give them all ourmoncy.

Liesel: We live in tiny cells.

Inga: Etc.. etc. Iflistencrs want to

college: a wiseecracking roommate,
cool techno gadgets, weirdoes who
