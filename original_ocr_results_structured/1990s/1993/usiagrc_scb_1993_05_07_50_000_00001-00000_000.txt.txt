Bly's Wednesday evening poetry
reading in Main Lounge,

Bly read a poem that he com-
posed for Rachel’s baptism. In addi-
tion to reading his own famous works,
Bly read some of his favorite poems by
Emily Dickinson, Langston Hughes,
William Stafford and others

“Oneof the greatest things about
writingpoetry ordeingartisyoucan
notice what's missing," Bly told the
crowd. Oneofthe missing things that
Bly noticed was an oral tradition in
education.

“The trouble with our teaching
is that there's too much reading on
the page and not enough speaking."
Bly said, Bly played a bouzouki to
accompany some of his readings.

There is a distinction between
wanland desire, acceding to Ely, He
sees a preoccupation with the more
superficial want in our society, espe-
ciallydue to television, “How would
our lives be different if our parents
actually phrased what they desire?"
Bly wondered,

“Bly reminds us that one of the
poet‘s responsibilities is to attend to
the needs of a civilization, which is
both above us and deep within us as
individuals," Barlow said. “He also
reminds us thatpoeiry is an oral art“

Bly said thatinordertobehappy,
one must actively seek father and
mother figures. “The rest ofyour life
will be determined by how brave you
are in going out and finding teach—
ers." said Bly.

Ralph: Rape

By Drella Naxe

APE is a war crime, claimed
R Regan Ralph, staff attorncy

for the Women’s Right
Project at the Human Rights Watch
(also known as the Helsinki Watch)
in Washington, D. during a talk
she gave in front ofa small audience
in North Lounge yesterday.

The Geneva Convention, which
took place afterworld WarlI, did not
include rape in its list of war crimes.
The reason behind this, said Ralph.

a War Crime

was thatrapes had been commited by
both sides during the war years. As a
result, there is achance that the thou-
sands ofrapisis in formerYugoslavia
could “getaway with it."

To prevent that from happening,
Ralph urged concerned individuals
to write to their House representar
tives,PresidentClinton,Buiros Gali,
United Nations Secretary General,
and Padovan Karadzic, president of
the selfrproclaimed Bosnian Serb rc-
publichand demand that rape be con-
sidcrcda warcrimc. Letterscan make
the difference, Ralph said.
