White House
goes electric

your letter to the White House. For the first time in history, the people
of America have a direct pipeline to the President.

Several weeks before his Inauguration, President Bill Clinton appointed
Jeff Eller to take charge of creating an interactive public E-mail system into
the White House. Jock Gill was then hired by the Clinton administration to
work under Eller. Gill’s personal CompuServe account then was used to
route messages into the White House.

Presently, the E-mail system is not completely functional. Due to the
highvolumeofmail,theClinum administration has notbeen abletodeal with
every single message. Once the White House E-mail learn has developed the
system tohandle this hugeamountofmail,E-mailcontactshouldbecomc the
easiest and mostefficient way to route letters to the White House. Until then,
the old ‘snail mail’ address (1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N,W., Washington
DC, 20500) is more efficientand reliable.

Tuesday evening I sent a message to President Clinton congratulating
him on wining the election. Unfortunately, at press time, I have received no
answer. This comes as no surprise because probably every other college
student and every third person with an E-mail account is vaxing President
Clinton. But someday, there will be a way for President Clinton to answer.

Indian languages, as well as possess-
ing reading knowledge of German
and Spanish. Mukherjee said that she
often worries about the craft and lan-
guage construction of her stories.

“My agenda is to show the ordir
nary in the extraordinary and the ex
Lraordinary in the ordinary,” she said.
“As a writer, I want to get a across a
kind OI vision of the world, butI also
think about how, in what way, I am
going to do that.“

Mukherjec encourages writers
to stick with itand to not be discour»
aged by rejections.

“In one’s life, there are many
rejections. Success isn’t instant and
success shouldn’t be confused with
fame. Success is self-satisfaction.
Each novel transforms [the writer’s]
life and society in some way.
