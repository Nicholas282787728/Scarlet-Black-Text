Outcry Falls on Deaf Ears

By Craig Hooper

 

 

Grinnell College theater community as Phillipa Gordon’s

two year tenure as a replacetnent professor draws to a close.
Efforts to grant Professor Gordon a tenure track position apparently
have stalled, but as Gordon's final semester begins. students are
debating the prospects of vigorous action to counteract perceived
administrtttivedisinlcrcstin the health oftheGrinnell linearts commu-
titty.

“It is surprisrng,” said sophomore letmey Lipshutz, “that one of
the tnost wellrrcgarded liberal arts colleges around does not recognize
that the theater is a large part of our Grinnell culture and learning.”

The theater community feels that Gordon has exceeded their
highcstexpeciations. “The things that she’s done for this deparunent,"
said sophomore Lisa Dom, “she did not have to do because she was
only hired for two years and I think that most of the people who come
here for two years do only what they have to do and then leave. She
came here and she put all ofherenergy into this school and this theater
department. andI think that just outof respect forhow devoted she was
to our school right from the very beginning she should be given a
position.”

Professor Gordon,or “Pip" as thestudents call her, is very popular
in the student theater community. “She‘s so awesome. I totally love
her," said sophomore Matt Atherton.

Gordon has achieved a legendary status within the student com»
munity. “I have two people on my floor who work behind the scenes
for every play," says senior Mara Millar, “and they think Pip is a god.
I mean, Pip is just the best thing that has ever happened to these
people."

Students Call Gordon a person who brought new vitality and
respect to the theater department. “By bringing in Pip a lot of life has
been injected into the department,” said senior Sarah Heller.

Gordon isseen as something ofa dynamo, organizing projects and
polishing the theater facilities. “She helps the theater departmentrun
like a well oiled machine," said one theater supporter.

Students are shocked that their efforts to maintain Gordon as a
permanent faculty member have been blocked by “administrative
politics.”

“11' we have somebody like Pip who has proven that she is
excellent, then we should keep her,” said SGA Vice President Dave
l-latzfeld. ”What more do Dean Duke and PresidentFerguson want?"

“I’m angry at whoever decides how big a deparunent is," said
junior Susan MeBumey. “I feel like we’ve written everybody and
talked to everybody and nothing’s really made that much difference.“

The Gordon issue, sotne believe, is merely ti symptom a larger
problem andaquestion ofthccommitmentoftheadmitiistration to the
