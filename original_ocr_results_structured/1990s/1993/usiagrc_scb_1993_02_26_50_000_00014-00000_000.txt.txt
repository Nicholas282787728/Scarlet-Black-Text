Women’s Basketball Makes Fourth
Consecutive Tournament Appearance“

( :ONSISTENCY is the model
that the Grinnell women's
basketball team has used

under the guidance of its sixthryettr

coach. Ted Eskildsen. The Pioneers'
elTort has paid dividends as they gar-
nered their four—straight Midwest

Conference championship touma-

mentberth.IllinoisColIege,thesouth

division titlist, will host the {our-
team event today and tomorrow in

Jacksonville. Illinois.

Eskildsen and his troops will feel
like they are looking in the mirror
when they battle northrdivision
champs Lawrence. The Vikingshave
also played in the tournament four
straight seasons In the 1990 title
game LawrencenippedGrinnell, 53-

50, for the crown. The Pioneers ;

avenged Lheloss in 1991 with a 64759
win in the first round of the toumey,
and then wenton to win the title over
1.0 This January the squads battled
again in Wisconsin. Lawrence pre-
vailed 7443 in overtime.

“We are proud lobe in the toumar
ment again. The team’s goal was to
play its best basketball at the end of the
season. I thtnk we are reaching that
goal," commented Eskildsen.

Last weekend the cagers ﬁnished
regularseason play on the mad with
an 81-78 doublecvertime victory at
Monmouth and a 57-45 win at Knox.
Thevictories pushedGn'rtnelI'srecords
to 13-9 overall and 104 in the league.

Eskildsen said, “I was very proud
of the women because their presenta—
tion was solid Since we had a mum:—

could have gone either way. Knox and
Monmouth wanted to finish their sea-
sons on good notes, but our team met
the challenge."

Coach Eskildsen attributed the
win at Monmouth to three factors:
ﬁrst, the overall play of Jen Kelley
who posted a triple double with 13
rebounds, 13 assists and 11 points;

second, the late-game emergence of
Dacey Waldron, who netted ten of her
18 points in the two ovenime periods;
ﬁnally, the play ofLisa York and Kari
Hallett out of the power forward posi-
tion. Hallett had eightrebounds and 18
points while York grabbed four re-
bounds and netted seven points.
Waldron, Kelley and Hallett won
praise for their play at Knox, also.

Kelley, who nearly posted another
triple double, had nine rebounds, 13
points. and seven assists, Waldron
showed her ﬂair for dramatics as she
netted all 12ofherpoints in the last six
minutesllallettledallrebounderswith

The Victories last weekend as
sured the Pioneers of their fifth
straight winning season.
