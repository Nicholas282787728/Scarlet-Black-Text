fercncc games left and
an undefeated record.

Grinnell College men's soccer coach
John Pl’itsch has his team “in excel»
lent position to get into the champi
onship playoffs," This week uic Pio-
neers travelled to Cornell on Tues
day, and they play a nonrconfercncc
game against regionally-ranked St.
Olaf at Northfteld on Sunday.

Last week against Cornell,
Pfitsch was unimpressed with his
team‘s level of play. “We were llat.
We played really poorly in the first
half, and t was very displeased with
tltc performance," he said.

After seeing an early 20 lead
turn into a 271 margin at the start of
the second half, Pfitsch put in the

second unitwhich“scorcda goal that
broke their back,” leading to a final
score of 6-]. “Our younger players
looked really good, particularly the
defensive unit," he concluded,

at their opponent’s homecoming, in
what Plitsch termed ”a mismatch,"
the Pionecrs outshot the Blueboys,
45-2. while outscortng them, 271.
“We expected IC [0 be totigh, l)lll
they weren’t,” said Ptttsch.

In attempting to explain tltc (Its-
crcpancy between shots on goal and
goals, Pfitsch said that his teatn was
“comfortable because lllinots Col-

Women's Soccer Wins 2

HEGrinncllCollegewomcn’s

soccer team racked up two

impressive conference victo-
ries last week against Coe and Knox.
Wednesday. the Grinnellians travr
eled to Knox for a rematch and Sun-
day they will entertain Comell at 1
o‘clock.

Against Coe the Pioneers were
surprised at the level ofphysical play
provided by the Kohawks. “Coe has
really come on strong in the confer-
ence," stated Coach Martt Kingsley.
”They were a physical team, even to
the point of exceeding our expecti-
uons." Throughoutthel'trsthalfGt-in-
nell was willing to give up the ball as
a result of Coe’s intimidating physir
cal play.

“Finally, in the second half we
settled down and realized that we
could play their physical game,"
stated Kingsley, who watched her
tcamdown Coe,370. After intermis-
sion the team reorgantzcd and was
abletocompletely shutdown the Coe
attack.

Kingsley was especially imr
pressed withagoal thatjuniorMelanie

Parsons scored in the ﬁrst ha] I. “I've
never seen her play with such deter—
mination." she said. ”It was an amaz—
ing goal, as she took on three Coe
players to score.”

Grinnell had 38 shots on goal
againstKnox while managing to score
only twiceagainstwhatKingsleycalled
“a really great keeper who made some
impressive saves." Despite the domir
nation exhibited by the Pioneers,
Kingsley was less than satisﬁed with
her team's shooting technique, “We
weregelung Shots offbut from too far
out. We really have to refine our
shooting technique." she said.

One of the outstanding players
against Knox was sophomore Kendra
Potz. “I’m hopeful she will come out
and play like that every game now,"
said Kingsley.

Having ﬁgured out how to beat
the Knox goalie, the Pioneers are in
superb shape fortheir rematch. “Hope-
fully," said the coach, “we’ll become
moreofa finishng teatn and have more
action up front."

When asked to assess her teams
play thus far, Kingsley was extremely
positive. ”We're really moving along
in the Midwest Conference," she con»
eluded.

 

McGary is developing into “a fine
allrarountl player." Pfitsch also
poitttcdtoimpressivcplay from Sean
Ramsey, Zach Dtclz, Ryan Fenbcrg
and Dave Aprahamian as keys to the
success. “Oicourse,” added Pfitsch,

“Brennaman is a great goalie but he
doesn’tgetany practice. chuslrusls
back there."

”Our athletes are playing fine,"
concluded the coaelt. “I JuSl hope
they can hold their focus."

Coach Wallace, “and they are hitting on all cylinders right now."
