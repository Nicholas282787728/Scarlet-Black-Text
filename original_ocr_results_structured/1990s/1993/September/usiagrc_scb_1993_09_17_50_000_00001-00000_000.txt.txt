vocation.

The For tChicago mutiny case IS
the largest mass-mutiny trial in the
history or the U 3. Navy. Fifty Afri-
CztlirAillelcall ailors were accused
of mutiny when they refused to enter
unsafe working conditions loading
explosives onto ships.

The 50 sailors had survived the
worst domestic catastrophe of the
war when in July 1944 an explosion
at Port Chicago, Calif., killed 320
men, including 202 black men. Fol-
lowing the explosion, white survi—

vors were granted a lhirlyvday leave,
but the Navy ordered black survivors
to go to work in another port, More
than 200 refused and 50 were charged
with mutiny.

Thurgood Marshall, who was
then a young lawyer working for the
NAACP, went to California to de-
fend the black sailors. if the sailors
were found guilty, they could have
been sentenced to death Ultimately,
they were counrtnartialed,dishonor
ably discharged and denied benefits.

Allen, who has written a book
about the Port Chicago mutiny, is vise

1991 award-winning documentary by
