In the nnat against St. Norbert,
Grinnell “started a bit slow,” accord-
ing to Kingsley. With both teams
playing a similar attacking style, the
Pioneers did not get on track until
Neevel scored 17 minutes into the
game. “It was one of the best goals
I’ve seen all year. She took on sev-
eral players and beat them all," com-
mented the coach.

After warning the team thata 1—

Reﬂecting on her first season as
coach of the Pioneers, Kingsley said,
“The defense played the best they
have played all year. This is a legiti-
mate team and we just took them out
of their game. This fourth straight
title was a significant feat because
this is a different team than it was a
year ago."

Women's X—Country
Seeks a Third Midwest
Conference Title

l-l‘EN Evelyn Frecman,Grinnell Collegcwomen’scrosscoun-

try couch, talks about big meets, she mentions November.

For cross country teams the pinnacle is the conference meet,

the regional meet and the national meet, all held in the next three weeks.

Tomorrow the Pioneers seek their third-straight Midwest Conference
championship at Illinois College,

Coach Freeman, who has coached teams to six league titles and five
secondrplace finishes, has the best squad Grinnell has ever had. Heading
into the championships the Pioneers are ranked 23rd among the nation‘s
NCAA Division III teams.

“I don’t know what to expect because our full team has not run
together in the last month, We will be looking for fast times, though,
because the course is flat," commented Freeman.

The Pioneer lineup features only one senior and a host of first— and
second-yearrunners. Sophomores StephanicHitztalerand Ally Beckman
are joined by junior Jennifer Jacobsen and senior Jessica Henry as
returning all-conference athletes. To win the honor a harrier must ﬁnish
in the top 15 at the loop meet. “One of ottr goals is to place everyone from
our top group in the top 15 to eam allconference honors," said Freeman.

Additionally, Hitztaler, Beckman and rookie Stephanie Walters
should vie for the individual title. Coach Freeman noted, “I expect that
trio along with Katie McBride, to be at or near the front of the pack."
Hitztaler finished second last year with a time of 20:09.

_ Last season sophomore Holly Pfitsch narrowly missed all-league
honors, finishing 16th. Pﬁtsch has consistently finished as Grinnell’s
fourth runner this year. Maureen Ness, Gretel Kiefer and Laura Sullivan
round out Coach Freeman’s lineup.

Freeman finalized, “We’re easing up a little in our training at the end
ofthe week. Our focus is on the regional meet next week. This isjust a
dress rehearsal."
