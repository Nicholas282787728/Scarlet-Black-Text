out with this one. Deadlines!
Ugh!)

EAG Helps Jasper County with 8000 Acre
Prairie and Savannah Restoration Project

Project is first of its kind ever in the United States

By Sarah Cornell .

RINNELLIANS afiili
G ated with the Environ

mental Action Group
(EAG) and the Iowa Department
ofNatural Resources have begun
to restore 8000 acres of prairie
and Savannah to their original
condition at a site in Jasper
County.

Tanya Haney, ‘95, and Sean
McGann, ‘96, are two students
who have volunteered their time
to this restoration project. Haney
says that she sees this as “a very
unique opportunity, to see some-
thing that was here before a lot of
settlers came." In fact, only 0.1%
of North America’s native prai»
rie is left. It is important to re-
store the prairie because of “the
utter lack" of natural grasslands,
according to McGann. We may
lose one of our last opportunities
to value its natural state, or even
lose the chance to discover new
medicines. Grinnelliansare con
cerned, and through EAG and the

Leadership Conference Education Fund, Inc. (Btn‘c

efforts of individual students, a
group will be working at thclas-
per County site every weekend
throughout the fall.

Originally intended to be the
location of a new nuclear power
plant. this site will be the first
reconstructed prairie site in the
US. Other areas of prairie have
been preserved in states such as
Oklahoma, but until now no one
has attempted to restore the na-
tive flora and fauna of a prairie
or Savannah to a reserve area.

There are four steps to a prair
rie restoration project. First, bi-
ologists research the original
types of grasses that lived in the
selected area. In stretches of ac-
cidentally preserved grassland.
they find some of the original
species and their seeds, which
then are isolated and germinated
in greenhouses, so large amounts
of seed can be re-sown during a
later stage of the project. At this
point, the Jasper County site is
still in this exploratory stage.

Second, the acreage is

cleared of all current vegetation
that does not belong in the dc-
sircd habitat, namely corn, ovcrr
grown shrubs and small trees.
This is a very labor~intcnsivc
stage in the‘restoration of the
prairie. Agriculture has done the
greatest damage to the native
prairie, becauseover cultivation
compacts soil and makes it imr
possible for the original grasses
to survivc.

Third,thecollccted scedsarc
marked for reintroduction into
different areas of the site, which
will be divided fairly equally
between savannah and prairie.
Savannahs are generally more
overgrown than prairies, and sup4
port a slightly different range of
wildlife. Then workers sow the
seeds themselves -» again, this
stage is quite labor intensive, but
the reward for such an extend
project is immeasurable, because
the newly established base of
plants can soon support a com
munity of original wildlife.

Thereintroductionofthatwild-

life takes place in the fourth, a
ongoing siagcofrestoration. Jasp
County wtll soon be the home r
herdsofelkandpacksofcoyote,a
a host of smaller animals native
the prairie. but ultimately a herd «
buffalo could be introduced.

To preserve this newly r
stored area of prairic, \vorkc

Resources mustperiodicallybu
the overgrown brush, and cot
stantly observe the site for sig

Grinncllians are playing
small but important part in d
veloping this new ecosystem.

and will be involved througho
the fall and into the spring. A
