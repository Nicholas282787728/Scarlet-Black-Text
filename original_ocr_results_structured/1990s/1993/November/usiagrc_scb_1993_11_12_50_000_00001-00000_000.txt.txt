“We heard (from the police) that
'omebody was in the building mak-

‘ [fairs Tom Crady. “We raced over
here with the police. They did a

Crady called a meeting of the
resident‘s staff at 1 pm. where the

“(The police) had to play the

bomb threat last Friday

a "misunderstanding”

tape three or four times,” said Crady.
“From where I was sitting, I could
barely understand what was being
said. The other people in the rooin
thought itsairi thatsotncbody placed
a bomb in the science building.“

Aftcrdetcrininingthatthethreat ’

was to place a bomb and not to make
a bomb, the decision was made to
clear the building. At 2:30 p.m., the
building was evacuated. Dean of
Faculty Charlie Duke, who was at»
ready at the science building assess-

“We left the building intending
to open it at noon on Saturday," said
Duke. ”The advice we got from the
police was that with bomb threats

us that it is difficult to make a timer
that goes for more than 24 hours."

November 17 at Firestone in Grin-
nell. The purposcoftheworkshop is
to instruct people on emergency car
repair and to teach students and com-
munity members about highway
safety, according to organizer Jes-
sica Stutman,

“Nobody plans on an emer-

drivers to brush up on their repair
skills. This is a good way to be
prepared."

At the workshop, experienced
mechanics will demonstrate how to

change ﬂat tires and oil, as well as
pointing out potential problems that
can occur on the road, said Stutman.

Representatives of FEARLESS
will also be present at the workshop
to talk about other projects the group
is doing.

“One of the primary things we
are working on right now is getting
callboxes along highways so that
when cars do break down they have
somewhere to call without having to
walk long distances," said Stutman.

This year,FEARLESS isdivided

REAKING the silence’ and

tic violence,” is the message that
Women Take Back the Nightorganiz—
ers hope was spread throughout the
Grinnell oommunityduringdtiswcek‘s
annual observance.

Women Take Back the Night is a
National event. and many Grinnelt

to plan and put on this year‘s event.
The week‘s activities included a
clotheslinc demonstration and a vari-
ety of speakers and workshops.culmi-
nating Tuesday evening with dining
hall demonstrations and a program in
the Nonh Forum Lounge. The emo
tional program was followed by a
discussion for men and a march of
women through campus and down-
town to the Jeanne Burkle Women‘s
Center for a speak-out for survivors
and supporters,

Tuesday evening’s program in
cluded women who shared their expe
riences of rape, incest, and domestic
abuse through poems, letters. stories,
and even song. Many campus groups
were represented in the program, in

woman had a special story to tell,
Stories of the Holocaust, a testimony
of incest, a Cuban letter. a survivor‘s
poem, a poem of women’s ‘place’ in
society were several of the stories
shared, yet all had common themes of
uniting women‘s voices, breaking the
silence, making change in our society
and getting away from a “culture of
violence." In short, each woman
begged the audience to ‘take back
the night.’

While many of the speakers re-
lated the honors of survivin g domestic
abuse and violence, one professor
chose a different route. “I am not a
survivor," said Professor Victoria
Brown, "I know nothing of what you
are running from. But I do know a lot
ofwhatyou are hopefully ninning to."

music was also part of the program.
Four Grinnell students performed
songs about women. and a dedication
ofJohnSeeada's“I’mFree" was made
to the audience by one speaker and
survivor of childhood incest, Joyce
