To the Editor:

As friends and former hall-mates
of Atsuhito Nakata, we are writing to
express our extreme dissatisfaction
with the adminisuation of Grinnell
College, for its mishandling of infor
mation concerning the recent death of
ALsu. We believe that, at the very least,
the administration should have noti-
fied the entire senior class, and not
only the senior international students,
because he had been a student here
during our tenure on this campus.

Atsu was our friend, and we
should NOT have had to learn of our
friend‘s death from The Grinncll
IIerald-chirtcr, a week after it hap
pened, and only then by accident.
The fact that the Grinnell College
adminisu-ation did nothing to inform
the students who had known him,
servesasatragicinsulttothememory
of a man who was murdered because
of his continued commitment to the
service of humanity. We would like
to thank TheScarIemndBlac/c forthe
article which ran in last week‘s issue
about Atsu, as well.

Atsu broughta great deal of hapr
piness tn Rawson Hall during the

1989-1990 schoolvyear, and we all
cherish memories of the great Limes
that we had to spend with him. Fur-
thcrmm‘c, his volunteer work as a
peacekeeper for the United Nations
in Cambodia demonstrated remark-
ablyadmirablecourage,compassion,
and strengthrof-charactcr.

As people who knew Atsu, we
will miss him, and to those of you
\vhodidnotknowhim,hisllfesh0uld

TRULY believed in helping other
people,abeliefwhich,sadly,eventu-
ally cost ALsu his life.

To the Editor:

We are greatly concerned about
the administration’s decision to pave
the Forum beach as a parking lot in
response to the so-callcd “campus
parking deficit.”

Of course centralized parking is

’important to everybody, but we

greatly question the benefits in view
of the inevitable smog when, at the
same time, the college is engaged in

a desperate war against the last han g-
ers-on of a bygone era when men
smoksdcigarettes and cancer ran free.

As we reside now in a time of
increased activism and awareness on
campus, we fear that this is tnore than
just a treacherous advance of vested
interests of the status quo. It is a delibr
ei-ate pavingrover of the very sit and
memories of thatinspiring visitin 1967
by Ken Kesey and his Merry Prankr
slers, and Tom Wolfe's reading from
the then unpublished manuscript of
The Electric Kooerid Acid Test.

In addition, we object to the
Trustees’ decision to fund this
“project" by forcing Pamela Ferguson
to take a pay cut. Now we ask: Is that
justice? Is that proper?

Dear Everyone:

At an acoustic show at Bob's I
played a song thatended up offending
some members of the audience. The
song hasbcen pcrformedbeforewith»
out problems, but I’m afmid my par-
ticular handling of the subject matter
went a little too far this Lime and ob-
scured the element of irony which is
essential to the song‘s meaning.

I’m disturbed by the prevalence
of sexism in rock music and feel a
responsibility, when writing. loavoid
orcountcractthistendency.Thesong
in question obviously failed to meet
this standard, and won't be heard
here again. To those who took ofv
fense, I apologize.

Mockery of Justice
in Los Angles

W0 of the officers who beat Rodney King in 1991 have been
I convicted of violating his civil rights. The conviction is uneon
stitutional, does violence to the facts, and seems to have arisen

from the basest political motives.

The second trial, with acarefully selectedjury, was a show trial that
would have pleased Stalin. But it‘s rather irrelevant that the second trial
was a farccﬂthere were no legitimate grounds for it in the first place, at
least not to anyone with knowledge of the Constitution.

The Fifth Amendment states that no citizen may “twice be placed
injeopardy” for the same act. Lawyers for the prosecution say that the
charges in the second trial were not quite the same as those in the first,
and that is true. But the act for
which the officers havejustbeen
triedis thesameas thatforwhich
they were first tried.

Putting aside its constitur
ttonality, was the verdict cor-
rect? Let's review the facts. A
high and drunk Rodney King led several officers on an eight-mile car
chase. When they finally caught him, he repeatedly grabbed at his side,
as though groping for a gun, made obscene gestures at the female
officers, and lunged atOfficer Powell. The officers tried to subdue him
with stunguns, but this failed. Only then did they bring out the sticks.
They beathim for only 81 seconds-a much shorter time than they could
have beat him for.

According to the law, to violate King’s civil rights, the officers
would have had to be motivated by racism. Given that they did not harm
the two blacks in King’s company who refrained from violence and
provocation, it seems
that a desire to sub-
due the crazed ani-
matinot racism—
was their motive.

The retrial and
conviction were
clearly unjust, but
thenaconcem forjus-
tree was not what in-
duced PresidentBush
to orderthereu'ial,nor
was it what induced
thejury tocounter the
first verdict with a conviction. They wanted to see the officershang, and
wouldn't letatiything so trivial as the Constitution or the evrdence get
in Lhc way. Why?

In the LA. not last spring, thugs shouting “no justice, no peace!"
murdered 53 people, injured 2,400 others, and looted or burned down
1,400 homes and stores.

The arsonlsts shot at firemen who tried to interfere with their grim
work. It was believed, perhaps correctly, that nothing less than a reu'ial
and conviction would appease the thugs. The assumption was that
appeasing them was the right course. As Chronicles magazine has put
it. there is one civilized way to deal with murderers, looters and
arsonlsts, and that is to shoot them.

In Columbia,judges areoften afraid to sentence men they know lobe
drug lords, for fear of retaliatory amassinaUOn by the criminals‘ pals. So
their dectsions often depart from jurispmdence. That’s not surprisrng in a
Third World country where tlterule of law has never existed. But when the
judicial process in aputatively civilized country is perverted and corrupted
by the threat of violence, it is a shocking affront to decency.
