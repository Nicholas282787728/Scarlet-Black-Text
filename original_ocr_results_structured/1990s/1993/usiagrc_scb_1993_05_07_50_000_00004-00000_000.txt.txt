at 10:00, Roberts Theatre,

Ensemble focuses on
sacred, profane music

y Jenny Matson

 

 

 

 

 

Relic T.A. Lysloff, will present a concert at Roberts Theatre

tomorrow night at 10:00. The Grinnell Singers and guest artists

from the University of Wisconsin, the University of Michigan and

Pomona College will join them, One of the guest artists, R. Anderson

Sutton from the University ofWisconsin, is a leading authority on

Javanese Gamelziri music. The concert will feature two types of
Gamelan music—the sacred and the profane.

The first half will consist of profane music which is lighter
music found in villages oflava. Lysloff described this rural type
of music as the “funky kind of Gamelan music."

Sacred Garnelan music will beplayed in thesecond halfofthe
concert. A long choral piece called “Bedhayan” will demonstrate
this type of music. This piece begins with the choir singing with
punctuation by the gongs andbuilds up in intensity to a very lively
end. In Java, this kind of music often accompanies sacred dance
performed for the sultan.

Lysloff said that whatattracts people to this group is that it is
both easy and difficultto play. “Youcan spend very little timeand
learn to play the melody or spend a lifetime learning the more
difficult elaborate instruments," said Lyslofft

The Grinnell Javanese MusicEnsemble consists of about seventeen
core studenu who meet twice a week for rehearsals. Lysloff pointed out
that the Gamelart is attractive to many people because anyone can find a
niche in the group.

Visible Music is the culmination ofToin Zlabinger’s Irtdpendcnt Project whose
purpose is to unite both the visual and aural arts in a live setting. Using MAX, a
programming language, and MIDI, computer-generated graphics will accompany
live music. Since the music is largely improvisational, the Macintosh computer
generating the graphics will be interpretating the music on the spot. The music will
be completly electric featuring Tim Polashek on synthesizer, Davtd Preston on EWI
(Electric Wind Instrument) and Zlabinger on electric guitar. ~TOIn Zlabinger
