The polices of the Chinese government toward
Tibet include population transfer of Chinese people to
Tibet, mandatory and forced abortions, and the killing of
Tibetan children, said Tsering. Religion Professor John
Powers, who has spent time in India with exiled Tibetans
and has studied the situation, agreed.

“It‘s like the Chinese government is performing
mass genocide of the Tibetan people,” said Powers.

tion. The Chinese government is also forcing Tibetan
women to marry Chinese men and Tibetan men to marry
Chinese women. Their purpose is to make it so that there
will be no ethnic Tibetans left."

During theinvasionofTibet by the Chinese in 1959.
more than one million native Tibetans, one—fifth of the
population. were killed. And now, with the aggresive
population transfer of the Han Chinese into Tibet,Tibet-
ans are a minority in their own country. said Tsering,

“Tibetans are now facing extinction in their own
country,” he said. “The United States should link the
most-favored nation status with stopping what is hap-
pening in Tibet. If the United States government is
really interested in human rights, they should stop
these atrocities.”

think or impermancncc, they will begin to tum inwards
and their focus will widen instead ofjust focusing on one
life, this life, and the one Carrier," said Tsertng.

To prepare for creation, the monks first participated
in an extensive retreat during which Urey spent fifteen
hours a day meditating on the mandala. The meditation
enabled them to visualize the mandala clearly when they
began to construct it.

The Gaden-Shartse Monastery was originally
founded in 1409 by LamaJeTsongkhapa and was one of
the Den-sa Sum, the three great monasteries of Tibet.
The monastery in Tibet was destroyed, along with 6000
other monasteries, when the Chinese invaded Tibet.
Approximately two million Tibetans lost their lives in
the invasion: out of three thousand monks in Gaden,
thirty-eight survived to re-establish the monastery in
India in the early 19605. There are now approximately
seven hundred monks living in the Monastery.

The Monastery occupies eighty acres, ten of which
arecovered by buildings, while therest is farm land. The
monks raise rice and spend four to five months a year
farming, However, the monastery is also a university,
offering its members an education in English, Hindi.
Tibetan, science and math. When the monks are not
farming, they spend agreat deal oftime in study, debate,
and prayer. A typical day begins at 5:00 am. or earlier,
and an hour is spent in memoriztion. Monks may memor
rize up to ten pages a day. Monday is a free day for dorng
laundry, cleaning or going to town, a half hour away.

Following their stay atGrinnell. the monks travel to
California. The monks were brought to campus through
the efforts and supportof President Ferguson, the music

department, the religious studies department, Chinese '

studies, the Rosenfield Program, SGA, ASIA, and ISO.

Production of The Joker by Ruth
Childs ’94 opens in Arena Theatre.
ThisisChilds’firstplay,anditmakes
its Grinnell debut after a premiere
performance at the National Theatre
Institute last fall. where Childs studr
it‘d last semester.

Beyond emotions and sclfrdcr
fense, The Joker relates the story of
Sally.adependentyoung woman who
signs up for gun lessons at the insis-
tence of her boyfriend, Pctcr. Sally‘s
lessons lead to self»discovery and
independencewhileamorelhanpror
fessional relationship develops be-
tween her instructor, Doug, and her.

"AS Sally takes control of Illegun,
she takes control of her own life,” said
director Brandon McClain ‘93.

Several dream sequences which
depict the various characters’ fantasy
worlds are interspersed between the

present moments of the play.

“Whatwc see arethecharactors'
idealized images of themselves,"
McClain added.

The play iLself, under the guid—
ance of Childs, McClain, and stage
manager Karin Watch, has grown
since the NTI performance. Prior to
break, improvisation by thecast was
used to generatenew ideas and scenes.
With these ideas in mind Chllds and
McClain reworked original scenes
and added new ones over the spring
break so rehearsals could begin once
classes resumed.

“Now the play is longer and or
ganized differently. This version of
The Joker is considerably different
from before. Some scenes, however,
are still developing through improvt-
sation and won‘t be set until Satur-
day," McClain said.

The Joker will be performed at
8:00 pm tomorrow nightand on Sun-
day nighrin the Flanagan ArenaThe~
atre. The cast includesjuniors Susan
McBumey, Sam Lobe] and sopho»
more Jim Kropa. Sound design is by
sophomore Mark Huang, and light
ing design is by junior Shea Nangle.
