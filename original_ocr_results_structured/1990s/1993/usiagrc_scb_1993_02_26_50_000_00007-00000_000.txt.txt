Grinnell’s problems
are not unsolvable

The past explains the present; We have control of the future

By Tom Zlabinger

HE face ofGrinnell College

I changes roughly on a four
yearbasis. By 1997.all ofus

will have graduated. People none of
us have ever met will be studying in
Burling andgoing to classes in ARH.

As a result, Grinnell students
have very limited knowledge of
Grinnell history. A ﬁrst year student
can only build a small picture of past
Grinnell through old yearbooks and
stories from juniors and seniors.

This lack of knowledge of what
has gone on atGrinnell keeps present
Grinnellians uninformed. There is no
way to know all the little facts and
figures in order to fully understand
present Grinnell. This information
would ﬁll countless volumes.

For example. the alcohol policy
at Grinnell Collegeis relatively now
Most everyone has heard of the
Grinncll Relays. In 1987, when the
drinking age in Iowawas raised from
19 to 21, Student Affairs made a
decision to end the Relays in order to
stay within the constraints of Iowa
laws In 1990, the U54 Federal Gov-
ernment instituted laws that forced
all institutions of higher learning to
enforce an alcohol policy, otherwise

the government would cease provid-
ing federal grants. This then put
Grinncll College in a bind, Student
Affairs had to come up with a policy
and put it into effect.

Another example is the Harris
Centert It is general knowledge that
the Harris Center is unpopular. But it
is not general knowledge that the
Harris Center was a student initiated
proposal. In 1988, when plans were
being made to renovate ARI-l, a group
of students got together and formeda
committee to plan a recreational
building that would solve several
problems. Believe it or not, students
complained that Gardner was too
small for all-campus parties. Darby
was getting ruined because all the
hugepartieslikeWaltzwerewearing
down the ﬂoorr Also, the theater in
ARI-l was too small. So. the space
occupied by the theater in ARI-I was
used for more classrooms and the
AV Center and the Harris Center was
built.

Since students only spend four
years atGrinnell, they do not feel the
results of their decisions and actions
and they don‘t know what has gone
on in the past. Most of the students
who helped plan the Harris Center
graduated before it was complete.
Students now think the Harris Center

was the college’s idea and blame the
college for it.

There needs to be a continuum
connecting the generations of
Grinnellians and in order to do that
every student's voice needs to be
heard. It is not wise that only a few
students on a committee make deci-
sions. It is necessary that every stu-
dent have input into what goes on at
this Campus. be it about the theater
department, the Harris Center. Bob's
Underground, the language houses or
the alcohol policyt

Take action For example, there
is Committee on Student Life that
meetsregularlyt If you have any prob-
lem with anything concerning life at
Grinnell.golothenextmeelingThursr
day at 4: 15 pm in one of the Forum
PDRs. let your voice be heard. Get
involved. Tell your RA or even Tom
Crady at Student Affairs how you
feel It is vital that the Grinnell Col-
lege community sticks together. Im»
portantissuescannotgetboggeddown
in bureaucracy. The future of the the-
ater department and the new Fine
ArLs building are two issues that will
effect the future of Grinnell. Every
Grinnellian’s voice must be heard in
order that the best decision possible
me made so it will stand the test of
time
