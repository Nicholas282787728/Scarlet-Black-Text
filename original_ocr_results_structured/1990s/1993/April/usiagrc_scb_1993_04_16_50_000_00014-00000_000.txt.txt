Close conference losses mar
start of baseball’s season

Senior Mark Lehman throws a four hitter against Knox to pick up second win

by Jason Wolf

FTER a week in which they
went 173, the Grinnell Col
lege baseball team saw its

record drop to 3-9 overall and 175 in
conference play. Coach Patt Foster
lamented, “We’ve done some things
this year that have been tremendous
and we’ve had great individual ef-
i‘orls by almost everyone, but they
haven’tsc/emedtoallmeshtogether.”

Tuesday the team split a double-
header with Cornell. in the iirstgame
the Pioneers rallied to lake the lead
only to watch as the Rams snatched
the victory in the top of the seventh.
In the bottom of the inning the Pio—
neers loaded the bases but failed to
score. According to Foster, lack of
clutch hitting with runners in scoring
position has been the team’s weak-
ness all season. Grinnell has left 100
runners on base, with 71 of those in
scorin g position.

In the second game the Pioneers
jumped outtoaS-O Ieadin theseeond
inning and never looked backns they
won, 1 1-0. Freshman outﬁelderNigel
Lawes hit a home run and batted in
four runs. Sophomore centerﬁelder
Ian Carlson, who is hitting at a teamr
leading .435 clip, had two hits and
knocked in three runs. Senior pitcher
Mark Lehmann picked up hissecond
victory by going the distance and
allowing only four hits.

host to Knox, In the [irst game the
Pioneers were stymied by the bril-
liant pitching performance of Darren
Smith, the visitors’ ace. The
diamondmen scored three runs on
three hits in the ﬁrst inning, and then
were held hitless for the rest of the
game. Freshman hurler Edwin
Wymerpitched acomplete game and
wastaggedwnhthe6—3Ioss,Wylner,
who was charged with only three
earned runs, improved his E.R.A. to
3.16 for the season.

In thesccond game, the Pioneers
countered by sending Lehmann to
the mound. Although he pitched a
complete game, allowing only two
earned runs, his efforts were not
enough as the team made two errors
and stranded 10 baserunners. Once
again the team rallied in the bottom
of the seventh inning with a Lriple by
Dan Packard and and RBI double by
Najja Williamson, but fell short. 65.

When asked to assess his team‘s
play thus far, Foster pointed to sev-

eral key statistics. Although the Pio-
neers are hitting .324 as a team and
have a 3.59 E.R.A., their conference
record is 175. However, those
five losses have been by a total of
seven runs.

Thus, concluded the coach, “We
could easily be 6-0 ifaball falls in for
ahitwhen we'veneededit. Butwe‘re
still a young learn and we’re making
young mistakes. We're knocking at
the door but we haven‘t knocked it
down yet."
