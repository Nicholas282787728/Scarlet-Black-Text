Tiananmen Square survivor in Grinnell

By Alexandros
Kambouroglou

EADER of the Chinese pm
I democracy student move
merit, Sheri Tong, talked in
SouthLoungconWednesdayt'fong's
lecture "China's Search for Democ-
racy: Tiananmen Square, Before and
After," dmcnbed theJune1989 events
as having been "peculiarly" covered
by the "Western media."

"The movement is known as
TiananmenSquarebeeause thewest—
ern press w‘erein Beijing. More than
230 cities had movements across
China, however. The western press
also ignored another steady force
which was the power struggle within
the government," said Tong.

Tong emerged in 1938 as the
pro-democracy movement‘s driving
force after founding the Committee
of Action, a human rights group that
was quickly suppressed by the Chi—
nese government. During the massar
are on June 3—4, 1989, Tong chal-
lenged the troops and then was saved

by civilians who hid him. Heescaped
from China one week later and are
rived in the U.S. on June 11, Tong
returned to China last July. He was
arrested in September and released in
October. He lives in exile in the E03-
ton area, wherehe is chairman ofthe
Democracy for China Fund and a
graduate student in political science
at Boston University. He is 25 years
old.

Looking back, Tong described
the internal student organimtion of
the movementas "chaotic." "I was 20
years old at the time. We could even
see that we were a threat to the au—
thorities, but we had overwhelming
support from society; beyond expec-
lotion,

As organizers, though, we
weren‘t stunned by the momentum
generated. We were able to put a
newspaper together in a day, and had
an independent radio station broad-
casting frem a dorm room, all be
cause of the support," said Tong. To
do well on a "continuous level" be-
came difficult, and the end result of
the movement was result of the shift-

ingoftheleadership,explainedTong.
Theoriginallcaders likchimseli were
replaced by more radical students,
and had to move out of Tiananmen
Spuare and back to campus. As a
result, when the government called
fordialogue, "whoever was there went
to the discussions," said Tong.

it was not the Party that started
the Reform Open Door Decade but
the people. "It was (I bottom up re-
form with which eng Xiopingjust
inevitably wentalong," claimedTong.
His generation grew up in times of
rapid social change. As a result,
today's Chinese youth,espccially the
urban part, has become very indi-
vidualistic. This constitutes a break
from traditional Chinese perception
of the self. "I believe this generation
wtll continue to be the pioneer forces
for the movements to come," said
Tong.

In China the changes are hapr

cies from countriessuch as the United
States can play very significant posi~
live (or negative) roles, or no role at
all. Tong expressed the beliefthatlhe

Said that he has a sense ofhope. "The
change, however, won't happen that
easily."
