0U wake up with fiveminr
utestogettoyour8o’clock
class. You grab a pair of

pants and a sweat shirt and then
stumble to find yoursneakers. Three
minutes to get to class and your
shoes areno where to befound! Out
of the comer of your eye you spot
thcm, adorned with the four rows of
colorfulbeads strungacross theeye»
lets. You gently slip them on and
hurry to class.

Most ofus are familiar with the
“ﬁve minutes tillclasspanic,”butare
not familiar with the friendly greet-
ing of brightbeads strung across our
sneakers or the ability to slip sneakr
ers on quickly without having to
worry about untied shoe laces diag-
ging behind. This is where sophor
more Zack Stevens comes in.

Zack is an inventoras well as an
entrepreneur. He is the creator of
Zackamor, a new creative way of
keeping your shoes on without the

 

Zack and his Zackaroos

useof laces. Zoe/rumor are essentially
adjustable straps ofelastic that can be
strung across one’s shoes and then
decorated with beads, bells, fabric paint
or whatever, to add the owner's per
sonal touch.Although Lhedesignseems
quite simple, the process to develop
and market Zackamar has been along
and continuing process for Zack.

Zack came up with the idea of
Zackaroor several years back, when
his little sister used to vertically strap
her laces across her sneakers, as a
more fashionable way to put her
sneakers on. The only problem she
found with this was that the laces
ended up creatinga little bump at the
bollomof hershoes,makingithard to
put them on. Zack came up with the
idea of stringing pieces of elastic
through the shoes, to make puttingon
of the shoes a lot easier as well as
getting rid of that. little bumpr His
original model took a piece of elastic
and two pieces of crimped aluminum
at the ends. His sister liked the idea,
used it and then shared it with her
friends.

 

ZaCk decided topursue his inven-
tion funher by applying for a patent.
and marketing his idea. He explained
that a patent cannot be okayed unless
the idea is proved to be unique as well
as purposeful. To Zack’s surprise he
found an invention already patented
almost identical to the one he created.
In frustration, Zack decided to embelr
lishonhisdesignbyaddinganadjuster
on oncend,so thatzi person could more
easily adapt the elastic to their shoe
size.

The next problem was finding a
piece that could beusedasanadjuster.
Zack explained that he wasatafriend’s
house and noticedasmall square piece
ofmctzll wilha holein iton his friend’s
blinds hanging in the window. Zack
realized that this was exactly what he
had been looking for and ended up
searching stores that sold blinds until
he found the perfect sized piece.

Since then Zack has turned in a
patent application and is currently unr
der a patent pending. He has devel-
oped his product and packaging and
has about ten different stores selling

his product, including Cunningham
Drug and Ben ankiin in town. He
now hashisownassemblerin St. Paul,
MN.

Unfortunately Zack has not yet
turned a profit from lac/carom, He
explains thathe has run into so many
complications in the past thatheended
up spending a lot of extra money on
perfecting the product rather than di
rect production. Because Zack is the
sole owner of lac/«trims, he has little
money for investing in better packag—
ing and improving the product,

Despite the frustrations thatZack

has come up against, he has contin-
ued to purse his dream. Zack ex-
plained that when he feels discour-
aged, something positive always
comes up that encourages him to
keep going. Zack’s dedication to his
personally created business is amaz-
ing. With dreams and perseverance
of his kind, he is destined to be we
cessful in whatever he does.
