 

Letter of Resignation
from 8017’: Underground

After the 1989 closing of
Hector's (the onrcampus pub located
where Bob's Underground is now)
and then the closing of Gardner two
years later. Grinnell College began
taking on a strange new atmosphere.
Talk to any senior or recent Grinnell
graduate and they will agree with me
on this. A silent message telling
students that they are becoming more
and more powerless at Grinnell Col-
lege was sent out after these changes
occurred.

Last year, in reaction to this feel-
ing a group of students (including
former SGA presidentand ’92 gradu-
ate Matt Stippich, senior Paul Egan,
sophomore Alexia Brue, myself and
many others) devoted a great deal of
theirtimetowardscreating Bob‘sUn-
derground, with the intent of recreate
ing a student run environment like
Hectar': or Gardner. where students
and faculty could go arid hang out
without the tensions of everyday
school life.

But now the blatant truth of the
matter is that the average student
does not have any control overBob's.
The coffee house is currently being
run by a handful of individuals who
are makingniles andare ignoring the
dreams Bob’s was built on.

I have been with 5017’; since the
beginning. And anyone that knows

me knows of the devotion and energy
I always put into the coffeehouse; I
was able to hold on to the original
dream. I applied for the position of
Assistant Manager this semester be-
cause I saw that last semester’s man—
agement and SGA were not listening
to the students or the workers.

SGA did not hire me because I
represented something that they did
not like: change. Every time I worked
at Bob’s people would talk to me
about their ideas and tell me their
frustrations because they knew I
would listen. I made the decision to
apply for Assistant Manager because
I knew I had all the necessary qualir
fications and thatI could help restore
the original goals ofBob's.

The managers hired by SGA are
good people just as the people in
SGA are good, but they are so caught
up in the idea of control that the real
needs of the campus are not being
heard. I want to make it very clear
that I am not writing this letter to
make enemies. I simply wantto state
the truths that I see.

I sat through ameeting forBob‘s

(Sea/Jet &Black

workers Wednesday night that absor
lutely infuriated me. The new smok-
ing policy was dicmted to us and we
were told to enforce it. Several of the
workers suggested ideas on how the
new smoking policy might be "11*
proved, but these points were ne-
glected. Manager Byron Johnson's
reply was “These are all good ideas.
We’ll keep them in mind.” I have
been hearing these lintm for the past
two semesters yet nothing has hap
pened.

Thejob of the managers atBab' s
is to empower the students, not to
make them feel powerless. If we
don’t stop this cycle ofnegleet,l fear
Grinnell College is going to lose ev-
erything that it stands for.

I am tired of trying to make
changes that are not going to happen.
I am tired of witnessing this blatant
disregard of student’s needs, opin—
ions and suggestions. And so, with
sadness in my heart, I proudly resign
from my position asa workcratBob's
Underground.

LETTERtrom previous page

efforts on making the public aware of
a centuries old evil that still lurks
among us. Furthermore, I am dis-
mayed by Mr. Washbum‘s lack of
understanding regarding the outrage
a vast number of people feel about
the beating of Rodney King. Such
outrage is the result of a deep-seated
belief that there is n_Q justification for
brutality. The Los Angeles police
officers involved in the beating of
King continued heaping vicious
blows upon an already subdued man,
who was lying prone on the ground.
for one reason—they thought they
could get away with it because he
was black. In failing to consider the
entirepicture, in which thediscrimina-
tr'onofwhitesisasmallpart,Washburn
is guilty of distonion as the liberal"
media he seeks to condemn.

To the Editor:

Upon seeing and improved (in
my eyes) 5&8 I Wasgmimpressed.
The layout is crisp without being
stilted; congratulations to your Lay-
out Editor and all those involved!

I was however saddened to find
yet another “Common Sense” article
by Mike Washbum. I freely admit I
do not have the answer on how to
reduce racial tension, butI do try not
to encourage or induce it, as Mr.
Washbum has done. I also admit to
notknowing as much as I should (as
a human) in the Rodney King case,
butto use the phrase “Justifiably beat
Rodney King” is repulsive. It is a
shameful thing to think that someonc
believes another human was “justify

ably" beaten. This is not “common
sense“ to me, Mr. Washbum.

To the Editor:

Mike Washburn’s references to
rapein“MediaDistorts Racial Crime"
twist the reality of rape and race...
Washbum alleges thatblack on white
crime is understated by the “liberal"
media.

This pieceevokes tired and timer
worn images of the black rapist. An
unforgettable scene in D. W.
Griffith’s epic The Birth afa Nation
depicts a heroic gallop by the white-
hooded knights of the Klu Klux Klan
in huntoffademcnted black intcnton
rape forced a pretty, lilyrwhite vtrgm
to suicide. Washbum‘s writing pcr-
petuatcs the“southernrapecomplex"
replete with the black rapist, a huge
animal crazed with desire: the white
target—a youthful, ﬂaxen-haired.
virginal maiden,; and her valiant,
manly AnglorSaxson vindicators.
Notwithstanding its persistence, the
mythified specter of the black rapist
was never established in empirical,
objective reality...

01d myths can never be safely
relegated to the past and we must not
“whitewash” how the white man has
manipulated the rape of “his” own
women as a rationalization to act
against black men. But today the per-
vasiveness of real rape combined with
the racist manipulation ofrape fears,
must be understood as a medium of
control against the autonomy, mover
mentand endeavors ofALL women,
black. white, yellow, and red.
