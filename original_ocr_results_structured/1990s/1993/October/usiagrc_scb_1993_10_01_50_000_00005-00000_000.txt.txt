I on—Westem Ensemble Combines Javanese Music, Dance

By April Shaw

RINNELL'S penchant {ordi-
versity is reﬂected in the
Non-Western Ensemble:

avaneseGamelan and Dance, which
as its next campus performance on
necember 9 in Roberts Theater.

Taught by Associate Professor

[music Roger Vetter and Assistant
lI'IMLlSlC Valerie Vetter, thisone credit
‘ourse meets at least three hours a

eek to practice and learn Javanese

usie and dance. Currently 13 stur
jents are in the Gamelan (or orches»
ra), while seven students participate
n the dance.

Javanese muslc originates froin
he island oflava which is located in
resentday Indonesia. According to

" . Vetter, it is traditional music and
jance that is universal in all of Java
society. “This kind of music has not
seen infiltrated by western artistic
orms and is found in many different
‘oeial contexts, from palaces of elite
lets to villages of rice farmers.“

The dance that accompanies the

usie is carefully choreographed.
‘ or example, rhythm patterns for
mining sometimes correspond to

he rhythms of the dancers.

Two key ideals in tile Java eul-
ure are selfconuol and refinement.
-0t.h of these are reﬂected in the

usic and dance. Selfeeontrol and
iscipline are most clearly shown

whereas refinement is displayed
through movement and execution.
An interesting aspeetof the mu-

as separate instruments. Those in-
struments in the unit include several
xylophone-like instruments. most
Wllh metal keys and gongs. Some of
the gangs are in graduated sizes and
can be used to play a melody, while
others are similar to the ones that
sound only one tone, Since the in-

struments are handcrafted. rather
than mass-produced to a certain stanr
dard, each set is often given a per
sonal name.

People who play the instruments
in Java don‘t own them; they are
usually commissioned to be played
for a Ceremony such as an inaugurar

Javanese music and dance cone
tinues to become more popular in the
0.8. Vetter estimated that Indone»

sian music can now be found in 200-

gan and Berkeley, where southeast
Asia courses are offered, are coin-
monly hoine to such groups. but he
knows of only two liberal arts colr
leges, Oberlin and Louis and Clarke,
that have a Javanese group.

Few of the students involved are
music majors, but most enjoy alter-
native music. Metnbers ofthc group
don‘t have to have musical experi-
ence. Andrew Walter, who is taking

his fifth semester of the ensemble,
says, “Everybody’s a beginner."

R. Vetter says students benefit
most from the ensemble when they
stick to the program fora few semeSv
ters. ”While staying with [the en
semble] for many semesters, there’s
always a new challenge to face ~
different difficulties with different
musical instruments”

The ensemble performs once a
semester at Grinnell, and is usually
invited to Visit other places during
the year.
