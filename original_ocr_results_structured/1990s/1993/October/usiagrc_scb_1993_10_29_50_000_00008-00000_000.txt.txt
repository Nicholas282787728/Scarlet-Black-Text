Tuesday the Pioneers faced
Carroll and Quincy to determine their
position in the tournament on Satur-
day “We shoulddo well,"comtnented
Coach Lori Sadewater before the
match, “if we play like we were this
week and stay injury free.”

In the past week Grinnell took on
Monmouth and Illinois College and
then Sangamon, Quincy, Illinois Col-
legeand Eureka at the Illinois College
Invitational.

At Illinois College the Pioneers
played three tough games against the
team, which is ranked fourth in the
region, and were undefeated in both
matches and games at the conference
level. Liz Nowaeki led the defense
with lodigs and Jodi VanMeter had7
blocks. Misako Uno and Nowacki
both served 100% for the match and
the olTense was powered by Michelle
Raymer'sgkills. “This match was the
best we have played as a team,” noted
Sadewater, “but Illinois College is
probably the best team in the confer

ence.“
