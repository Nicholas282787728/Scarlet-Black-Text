rity. The security on a college campus
is not a problem that SGA candidates
should waste their time on; it is an
issucthalconccms the administration.
Another campaign promise is a better
computer orientation during new stu-
dent days. Great! Now we have an
other unique leader promising to save
future freshmen from having toaskthe
person sitting next to them how to
“save" in WordPerfect. And they beg
us to support them for this. It is ridicu-
lous to have candidates present them-
selves as charismatic leaders who will
“tell" the administration how to solve
simple (or non—existent) problems.

But this is not where the absurr
dlty stops. The Students who vote
think thatthey are voting forofficials
who will change the route ofhistory.
What the students are really voting
for is a set of ambitious people and a
couple of impotent postsinot to
mention the wonderful ofﬁces that
these people get. Students vote for
Dave Hatzfelds, who make fools out
of themselves by declaring that they
are servants of the student body. Not
that this matters, for the administra-
tion makes decisions without giving
adamn whattheSGA thinksanyway.

Last year I voted for Angela,
onlybecauseldidn‘tlike Mike lson's
face. This is sad, for lwas exercising
my rights. This yearl'll proudly vote
for Kirt, not because I like him (I
don‘t know him), but because he
wants to disband SGA; the “opium
for the people” of Grinnell. And if
anyone thinks that Alan Ostergrcn’s
joumalism class is worth trying, I'll
be glad to shout with him for it!

LETTERS from page 11

ing a faculty member to the theatre

student body. and that students agree
that settling for mediocrity in any
department on campus lowers the
high standards of this institution.

However. because the only mem
bers of the Executive Council who
attended Friday’s meeting were Presi-
dent Ferguson and Dean Duke, we
still need your help, and we need it
qutckly, lfadding an additional fac-
ulty member to the theatre depart-

Ferguson, Ms. Dobbs, Dean Duke,
Mr. Freeman, Mr. Grey, Ms. Berke-
witz Gross, Mr. Lalonde. Mr. Smith
and Mr. Swamilo express your con-

We feel that the“studcnt body"
isjustthatﬁabody whoseentirewell-
being is put in jeopardy if one of its
parts is sick. The lack of attention
given to the theatre departntent in
recent years is an embarrassment to

vate liberal arts colleges. We need
your hasty support.

To the Editor:

I've always been envious ofthe
computers on board the Enterprise.
All you have to do is say, “Computer,
reverse the polarity of the forward
scnsor' my,” and it happens.

Life isn’t quite so easy at Grin-
nell. Just try saying, “Computer,
double space my paper, spellcheck.
use a nice font. throw in a title page,
makeitlooka litilelonger, then print
immediately." it never happens.

Therearepcoplcon campus who
can help you get the job done. User
Consultants (UCs) are waiting to an-
swcryour questionsinthe throccom-
pulerlabs on campus: TheARHGen-
oral Computing Lab, the YMCA (bee
hind the Health Center). and the Sun
lab in the Science Building.

UCs are not necessarily com
puter “gods.“ It is difficult for all
students, UCs included. to keep up
with the variety of cotnputers and
software packages available at Grinr
nell. But. UCs are experienced with

most computing problems, and in
many cases will be able to give you
immediate assistance. When you
think, ”There must be an easier way,"
or when disaster strikes, try contact-
ing the UCs on duty.

From the VAX, all students can
typo: UCFlNDER to get a listing of
the UCs currently on duty. You can
then use the SEND command to ask
them your question. or you can Call
them at their telephone extensions.

Grinnell College Computer Scr-
viccs (GCCS) can be contacted (lir
rectly over the computer by typing
HOTLINE. You should always try
the UC first before sending a ques
tion off to GCCS. HOTLINE can
also be used to report frozen tct’mir
nals,broken pnnters,aswcllaspolicy
suggestions, etc.

Finally, the Student Academic
Computing Committee (SACC) is
your student connection to GCCS. If
you have non-technical computing
concerns. please feel free to TELL
SACC on the vax. You can also type:

LAWS from page 10

both heterosexuals and homosexur
als, seven states solely prohibit hoe
mosexual sodomy. Regardless of le-
gal application. sodomy laws are
rarely used against heterosexuals and
mainly exist as a means of
criminalizing homosexualityboth in
ideology and action. Penalties for
sodomy range from a lesser sentence
of 30 days imprisonment, to a five-
year minimum in one state, and up to
a 20 year sentence in others.

Due to the recent media cover-
age most Americans are aware of
Colorado‘s passage of Amendment

, however they may notbe aware of
the speciﬁc wording of the amend-
mentand its effects on GLB people.
Amendment 2 changes the Colorado
StateConstitutionsoneitherthestate
norany unitofgovernmentcanimple-
mentany legislation that forbids dis-
crimination on the basis of sexual
orientation. The law was presented
as a measure removing any “special
rights" status from GLB people
therebyovertumingexistinganti-dis-
crimination statues in three cities.

According to Kevin chedo.
founder a group spearheading the
passageofAmendment2,“Gaysand
Lesbians live afﬂuent lifestyles and
are not the victims of discrimina-
tion." However, statistics since the
passage of Amendment 2 show a
dramatic increase in incidences of
violence and discrimination against
GLB people; the Colorado Anti Viov

lence Project reporLs that since the
amendment's passage violence
against GLB residents has risen
400%. Groups in twelve other states,
including Iowa, are planning similar
ballot measures.

Although not as prevalent, anti—
discrimination laws and prorGLB
policies are being implemented as
well.There are currently 5 states with
smte-wide non-discrimination legisa
lation varying from protection against
discrimination in housing,in employ-
ment, and in education on thebasis of
sexual orientation—two of which
prevent discrimination in all three.

However. such legislation does
not encompass the benefits given to
married, heterosexual couples, such
as: jointrincome tax filings, insur-
ance. health care. inheritance, sick
leave, and family memberships to
combat these inequities. some cities
and businesses have implemented
domestic partnership laws/policies
which provide nontraditional fami»
lies with the benefits accrued by hot-
erosexual couples.

Laws reﬂect society’s alLiludeSi
Discriminatory attitudes are prevar
lent in all aspects of today’s society
becuase they are supported by our
laws, When the laws are changed or
takenaway,societalsupportforthese
attitudes will also change or disapr
pear. However, as long as laws that
foster discrimination against GLB
peopleexist,discriminatoryattitudes
will continue to be legitimized and
perpetuated.
