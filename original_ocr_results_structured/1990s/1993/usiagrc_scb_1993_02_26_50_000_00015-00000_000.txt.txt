Women Swimmers Try Repeating
as Midwest Conference Champs

HAT will it take for the
Grinnell women’s swim
team to win its second

consecutive Midwest Conference
title? “A total team effort," answers
Coach Ray Obenntller. The tankers
travel to Coe this weekend with hopes
of defending their crown.
Obermiller sees the meet as a
threerteam race. Lake Forest and
Lawrence will battle the Pioneers for
the championship. “Themeet will be
unusual because every school will
have athletes in the finals. We will

not see Grinnell versus Lake Forest
in every event,” commented Coach
Obermiller. He continued, “It is hard
to predict what the outcome will be
because strong learn performances
will determine the outcome."
Obemtillerrests his hopeson team
depth, a strong diving corps and se-
lected individuals. Liz Fields should
compete for honors in both backstroke
evans and the 400 individual medley.
Andrea Jackson will be looked to in
both breaststroke events and the 200
I.M.,whileDanaDanleyisthefocusin

both butterfly events and the400 LM.
In thedtstance events hopes areplaced
on Sarah Icpsen‘s shoulders.

With acontingentofsixathletes,
Obermillcr ﬁelds his deepest spe-
cialty group. He expects Holly Kellar,
Ingrid Swenson and Sonja Cooley to
vie for diving honors. “If the diving
goes well, it could be the edge we
need," commented the coach.

Finally he noted, “We have al-
ways had good depth. This year it is
particularly important because every
point we can win is imponant."

ever, the team lost eight seniors to

graduaLion,and0benttillcrexpocLs this

and Nate Brennaman are expected to
lead the Pioneers‘ attack. Obermiller
alsoexpects Mark Andersonand Doug
Murphy to challenege in the freestyle

several swimmersqualifyl'ortheDivi»
sion III national meet. Luther Davis
should be able to qualify in the SO and
100 freestyle. Additionally, the 200
and 400 free relay teams of Davis,
Murphy. Anderson and Foster or Ben
Shaw could qualify.

Since the meet is three days long,
some swimmers will be competing in

mers in order to win."

 

 

Track Teams at Iowa
Small College Meet

NLY part of the Grinnell College men's track team is scheduled
to compete at the Iowa Small College Meet this Saturday
because of qualifying marks and Coach Will Freeman predicts

a solid finish from his team.

Sprinters Darren Young and Brent Dexterare the top hopefuls. They
will compete in either the 300M or 400M. Both are slated with Rob
Yamachika and Chad Folsom in the 4x200 relay and with Scott Newstrom
and Jon Andresen in the 4x400 relay.

Vaulters Tom N uzum and Dan Brozoski hope to reach their potential
Saturday as they prepare for the Midwest Conference meet in two weeks.
Middle-dislancemen Newstrom andJott Greenberg Should fare Well in the
1500M and 800M.

With the league meet just two weeks away, Freeman has his squad’s
sights set on that event. He plans tough workouts for this week and next
week the athletes will taper for the loop tilt. He concluded, "We need some
continuity out of some athletes. I am conﬁdent about our key people, but
there are a lot of other people who can make a diffemce. We need some
commitment from them to help the cause."

Willi only a few entries in the Iowa Small College Meet this Saturday,
the Grinnell College women’s track team will focus on its training and
technique work this week.

Since the state meet has qualifying entry marks, only a few Pioneers
will be cotnpeting. Coach Evelyn Freeman expects her rookie distance
runners Stephanie Hitztaler and Ally Beckman to be invited. Freeman
also hopes to assemble some relay units.

Last Friday the squad competed at the UNI Invitational. Freeman
commented, "The athletes did fine. We did not have all our people there
and some were competing in events for the first time."

The distance crew took honors as Beckman placed fourth in the
3000M. She ran an 11:16 in a very competitive race. Jennifer lacobsen

and Holly Pﬁtsch also posted solid times at 11:50 and 11:55.Hitztalerran
a respectable 5:38 in the mile.

Sprinters Jennifer Jones and Amy Reinhart also received mention.
"len ran a 64.4 in the 400M, which is her fastest time of the season, and
Amy posted a solid 28.1 in the 200M," commented Freeman.
