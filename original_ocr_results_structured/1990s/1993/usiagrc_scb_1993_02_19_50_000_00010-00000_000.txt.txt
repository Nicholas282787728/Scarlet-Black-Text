KDIC from page 1

“When I was hired by SPARC lastyear, lhad proposcda lotofehanges,
which they approved. But you find out that every time you try to do
something, there’s all this other stuff behind it."

Kashuba and Rich Churilla enthusiastically listed the improve
ments to KDIC’s management. “We‘ve had time to restructure, we‘re
one hundred percent FCC legal, we’re efficient, professional, and
we're introducing new music,” said Kashuba.

KDIC has put togethera stafftnanual with instructions for staffon
how to operate the various machines at KDIC. Their new chief
engineerhas worked for KGRN in Grinnell andWilliam Penn College
in iadio. They hope to phase in new equipment in the next five years.

Although the station has not substantially changed the DJ appli-
cation process, it has changed the structure of the listening day.

”It used to be that we worked our way from the ends of the
listening day to the middle. We‘re being more strict this year, putting
our first picks in the middle and working our way out to the ends.
We’ve shortened the day by about four to five hours, but we’ve got
good alternative shows," said Kashuba.

The areawith which KDIC is now most concerned is its direction.
It is trying to become more ofa “cutting edge" station, and Kashuba
and Churilla are trying to encourage more new music. KDIC now
reports its top 35 songs to the College Music Journal, which gives the
station access to promotions from record companies.

“We now have ten new music shows, whereas before we only had
one before," said Churilla. Churilla will be featuring Consolidated, a
band which is coming to Grinnelt, on his show from 8710 pm. on
Fridays, and will also be doing a telephone interview with the band.

In addition, KDIC has a CD promotion coming up with another
alternative band, Tit’ Faith Heaters.

THEATRE from page 1

from a belief that the theatre depart-
lnent has been neglected by the eolr
lege. “it is almost an inmngible feel-
ing," said one student. “It seems that
the college generally believes that a
large portion of theatre is leSl hlllt’lr
meringandscrewtng nailsintotlitngs
and that theatre activities do notcount
as academic education. Also, when
you read in Grinnelt Magazine that
labs are being redone in the Science
building and that faculty members
are being added in the science divi-
sion, it is hard to betive that you are
not being screwed."

Speeiftcally,thearre studenlswish
that the departmentbe expanded from
its current three to four faculty mem-
bers. Often theatre professors partieii
pate in ttie Gi'lnnell-ianondon pro-
gram or courses outside the depart-
ment. Theatre productions count as
elasses,limiting the numberofeourses
a professor can teach under the man
dated 3-2 course load. “Theatre is one
of the few, if not the only department
thathas not hadadditional faculty mem
bers added since the 372 program was
instiiuded,"said Ihng. “Because of the
unique abilities of the current theaue
faculty, this expansion would allow
adltional classes to be taught not only
in technical theatre butin acting and in
literature analysis as well.”

Students have organized to re-
search issues and to work on a gigantic
“mediablitz” thathas covered thecam—
pus with posters and position papers
informing the campus on the student
concerns.

“I‘m really grateful [to thetheater
students] for setting up what 1 under

stand will be a non-confrontauonal
meeting so that we can all talk about
these things together," said President
Pamela Ferguson. “1 hope it will be a
posiuvemoeung;ldon’tseethatinuch
value ever occurs out of real combat
ive rhetoric.”

Students and faculty have found
the bureaurocratic maze surrounding
faculty hiring bewildering and contra-
dictory. Theatre professor Sandy
Moffettelaimcdearlierthis month that
die department “has been asking for a
newposition forabout five years," and
that after the implementation of the 3,
2 program “there would be eventual
replacements." Hiring for professors
to replace lost ciniculum after the 3-2
program started has now ceased.

“I'm actually astonished to hear
that there is this perception that theater
is not valued by the faculty or adminr
isuation, because that plain and sim-
ply is not true," said Ferguson.

Dc'anDuke acknowledges thatttte
theatredepanrnenthas beenasking for
a new professor for several years, but
said that no proposal for a new faculty
membcrhas been submitted fordebate
this year.

The administration feels that
today’s meeting is a first step in the
hiring process, and are not eager to
tamper with the the system. The titer
atre students have other ideas. “We
would llketo seea decision within one
week," said lhrig, “We will not react
kindly to having our issue dissmissed
as ‘nothavingenough fundsavailable‘
or that we ‘didn’t follow proceedures
correctly' or by the adminisuation
avoiding ultimate responsibilityfor the
lack of attention lhathas been given to
the theatre department.”

HOUSING from page 1

to create more singles and thus attract
upperrlevel language students.

Afew HousingCommitteememr
bers andother students are concerned
that language departments won't be
able to fill these houses Willi willing
students and Will putpressure on stu-
dents majortng in the department to
live in them. According to a Housing
Committee evaluation completed last
spring of the Chinese and Russian
houses, a few unhappy students in the
language houses had felt pressured
by faculty into tivtng there.

“Thathappened because tlteSySA
tem asked for it to happen,” said
Professor Scott. She feels that the old
system was ”setting up for failure,"
and that greater certainty of getting a
house and continuity between years
would increase the interest of lan-
guage students in the houses.

A Language l-louseCommittee to
oversccandcvaluate the success ofthe
houses will be established. Callison
urged everyone to cooperate to make
the houses successful for the sake of
the students tivtng in them.

Student senators at the Joint
Board meeting voted to condemn the
way the housing decision was made,
calling it a violation of Grinnell’s
self-govemancc system. SGA Presi-
dent Angela Onwuachi said the con-
demnation will lack force unless stu-
dents stand behind it.

People on both sides of the issue
are watching to see whether students
will participate in the language houses.

“People will vote with theirfoet,”
EastAsian language professor David
Keenan said.
