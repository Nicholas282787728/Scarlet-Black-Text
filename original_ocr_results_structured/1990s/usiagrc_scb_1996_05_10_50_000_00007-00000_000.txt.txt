Happy Mother’s Day

Mother’s Day originated with Julia Ward Howe’s 1870 call to women to unite for disarma-
ment. Another Mother’s Day is upon us this weekend, as so many mothers the world over
are mourning for their children, husbands, and selves.

ARISE THEN, WOMEN OF THIS DAYl
ARISE ALL WOMEN WHO HAVE HEARTS,
WHETHER YOUR BAPTISM BE THAT
OF WATER OR OF TEARS! SAY FIRMLY:
“WE WILL NOT HAVE GREAT QUESTIONS DECIDED
BY IRRELEVANT AGENCIES,

OUR HUSBANDS SHALL NOT COME TO US,
REEKING WITH CARNAGE, FOR CARESSES AND APPLAUSE.
OUR SONS SHALL NOT BE TAKEN FROM US To UNLEARN

ALL THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO TEACH THEM OF CHARITY, MERCY, AND PATIENCE.
WE WOMEN OF ONE COUNTRY WILL BE TOO TENDER

"A Chronicle of Hope"

as: a nap
Since 1980, THE comprehensive source for:
- Peace Prisoner Support
. Action reports and networking for
anti-nuclear & anii-war
nonviolent direct action.

OF THOSE OF ANOTHER COUNTRY
TO ALLOW OUR SONS To BE TRAINED To INJURE THEIRS.”
FROM THE BOSOM OF THE DEVASTATED EARTH
A VOICE GOES UP WITH OUR OWN.
IT SAYS “DISARM, DISARMl
THE SWORD OF MURDER IS NOT THE BALANCE OF JUSTICE”
BLOOD DOES NOT WIPE OUT DISHONOR NOR
VIOLENCE INDICATE POSSESSION.
AS MEN HAVE OFTEN FORSAKEN THE PLOW
AND THE ANVIL AT THE SUMMONS OF WAR,
LET WOMEN NOW LEAVE ALL THAT MAY BE LEFT OF HOME
FOR A GREAT AND EARNEST DAY OF COUNSEL.

LET THEM THEN SOLEMNLY TAKE COUNSEL AS TO THE MEANS
WHEREBY THE GREAT HUMAN FAMILY CAN LIVE IN PEACE,
EACH BEARING AFTER HIS OWN TIME THE SACRED IMPRESS,
NOT OF CAESAR, BUT OF GOD~
IN THE NAME OF WOMANHOOD AND OF HUMANITY,

I EARNESTLY ASK THAT A GENERAL CONGRESS OF WOMEN
WITHOUT LIMIT OF NATIONALITY
MAY BE APPOINTED AND HELD AT SOME PLACE
DEEMED MOST CONVENIENT
AND AT THE EARLIEST PERIOD CONSISTENT WITH ITS OBJECTS,
TO PROMOTE THE ALLIANCE OF THE DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES,
THE AMICABLE SETTLEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL QUESTIONS,
AND THE GREAT AND GENERAL INTERESTS OF PEACE.
