SGA Vice Presidential/President of Academic Affairs candidate Jacob Willig

Elect Jacob Willig

The SGA Vice-President]
President of Academic Affairs
serves as a liaison between stu-
dents and faculty/administra-
tion on issues of academics, stu-
dent group concerns, and judi-
cial representation. To perform
thejobeffectively. the VP/PAA
must be dedicated, must have
good communication with both
students and faculty, and must
posses the ability to follow
through on difficult tasks. As a
student leader, I have developed
the skills necessary to perform
this job.

As a student advisor, math
tutor,andProgram Assistantfor
the Grinnell Summer Institute,
I have developed the skills necr
essary to be an effective liaison
between students and the fac-
ulty/administration. My re
sponsibility and dedication to a
project through its completion
are evident in my work in the
summer research program and
townrgown projects. In addi-
tion, I have experience working
with the college's top adminis-
trators through my involvement
with student interestgroups, ex-
tra-curriculum projects, and the
I Have A Dream program.

lam interested in working in
three main areas next year. First,
I will make better known the ways
in which students can get in-
volved with SGA to bring about
change on this campus, Second.
I will push for the creation of
more off-campus opportunities
such as exchange programs for
both students and faculty. Third,
I will establish a means for and a
commitment to diversifying the
student body, curriculum, and
faculty.

A quality education is con-
tingcntupon aknowledge of vary
ing ideologies, perspectives, and
world views. To provide such an
instruction needs more than spc»
cializcd upper-level courses in
select topics, such as Black
Women in America or Chicano
Culture. It must also provide an
exposure to a broad canon of
materials in intro-level courses.
Broadening the basic canon is
something that we here at Grin»
nell can and must do. As VP/
PAA, I will work with students.
faculty, and administration to
establish a base [or ongoing
change and continuing improve-
ment in this and other areas.

I think, for example, that it is

time we take a critical look at
Grinnell‘s curriculum in terms of
breadth and faculty diversity, com-
pared to what it was ten years ago
and lo what we want it to be ten
years in the future. Ipropose to set
up a student committee that will do
an extensive content analysis ofall
the courses taught here at Grinnell.
The committee will measure
Grinnell‘s progress toward provid
ing an education ofthe highest qual»
ity It will make recommendations
to thefaculLy/administration regard,
ing what changes students want to
see in our curriculum and faculty.
With student interest represented in
organizations such as this, the fac-
ulty and administration will be un-
able to ignore our high educational
expectationsanddcsireforthebcst.

I am enthusiastic about pursu-
ingtheseandmanyotherideas such
as moving the pass-fail deadline
and placing labs on transcripts.
Please come talk to me or vax
[WILLIG]; I look forward to your
input and ideas. I have the work
ethic andthederermination to make
a difference and follow through,
both on special projects and in the
day to day duties of VP/PAA. I
hope you will vote for me on Mon-
day. April 11.

Stamm awarded Watson
Fellowship for year to
study biology abroad

Student will travel to the Dominican Repub—
lic, the Bahamas, Canada, and Norway

Grinnell College Press Release
Grinnell College senior
has been awarded a

A Watson Fellowship to
spend the next year studying
marine biology in four nations
abroad.

Rachel Stamm, a senior biol-
ogy major from Topeka, Kansas,
plans to study “Cultural Views
Toward Marine Mammal Conser-
vation” in the Dominican Repub-
lic. the Bahamas, Canada and
Norway.

Stamm is one of 60 graduat—
ing seniors from 48 small lib-
eral-arts colleges to receive the
competitive fellowship from the
Thomas J. Watson Foundation.
She will receive a stipend of
$15,000 to cover her costs next
year.

Stamm plans to study how
the whale»watching tourism in-
dustry affects whales and how it
is related to the marine- mammal
research conducted in each coun-
try. She also plans to compare
cultural attitudes toward whales
and dolphins. Stamm chose Nor-
way because it is one of the few

 

countries in the world that still
sanctions whale hunting.

Although land-locked while
at Grinnell, Stamm has spent her
summer vacations working and
volunteering at the New England
Aquarium in Boston, the
Clearwater Marine Science Cen-
ter in Clearwater, 1:12., and the
Atlantic Cetacean Research Cen-
ter in Gloucester, Mass.

The Watson Foundation pro-
vides the fellowships so that the
recipients, by immersing them-
selves in other cultures for an
entire year, may explore inter-
ests of deep concern, test their
abilitiesand aspirations,andview
their lives and American society
in greater perspective. Criteria
for selection of Watson Fellows
include a capacity for vision and
leadership.
