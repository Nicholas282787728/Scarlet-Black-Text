Apollo 13

Based on astronaut Jim Lovell's ac—
count of an actual incident in 1970,
A 0110 13 is a vivid example of the
e tectiveness of (loclhdiama as an art
form. Using a talented cast (includ-
ing Tom Hanks, Ed Harris and Kevin
Bacon), Apollo 13 offers a rivering
play/by- lay of the intense efforts to
rescue the spacecraft, both by the
ground crew and by the astronauts
themselves. Apollo 13 falters slighte
ly when it tries to delve into the
personal lives of those involved, but

Bed or’Roses asks the question,
“What happens when a sexy horti«
eulttiralist (Christian Slater) is fate—
fully brought together wrth an over—
worked business executive (Mary
Stuart Masterson) and proceeds to
bombard her With ﬂower deliveries?"
However. it also begs the question,
“Do we care?"

We found ourselves constantly
answering, “No." This movie’s plot
fails for any number ofreasons. The
writers of the script missed the point
aboutromances; it’s the getting there
that’s interesting. Couplesalzeady in
love are boring to the average cn<
looker. In fact, the movie drags on
for nearly two hours, Furthermore,
Slater's character can easily be con»
strued as a stalker or a psychotic
Obsessivefompulsive. However, had
we been pre—pubescent, all of Slat—
er’s insane characteristics could be
overlooked by his incredible good
looks (well, Jenny thinks he looks

This time we are in agreement
and our consensus is: Don't go! Ree
mantic comedies like Manniquin
have more character development.
