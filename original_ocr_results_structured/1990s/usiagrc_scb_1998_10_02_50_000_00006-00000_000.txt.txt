This week’s conversarion is wirh arhlerlc
rrainer Silla Lowrher, who has been a morher-
in-residence, raking care ofsprains, orher in-
juries, and rehabilitation since 1990. After a

semester off, Lcwther is back in aerion--much .

ro every arhleres happiness.

5&3: Can you give us a brief hisrory or
your life?

Sil . I’m a Midwesternct; grew up in
Burlingron, Iowa and went to school or rhe
Universiry of Iowa. Then lwenr ro the Uni-
versiry ofOregon for grad school. Then Iwenr
down rhc coasr ro San Francisco, worked rhere
and rired ofrhe Wesr coasr. I decided ro come
back so rhar irwas safer riding my bike on rhe
highways compared en San Francisco.

58:13: How did you get inro arhlerie irain-
ing?

Silla: As an arhlcre, I experienced a couple
or injuries and, more imporranrly, 1 noriced
rhar reammares could lose rheir whole enjoy-
menr ofsporrs rhrough an injury. That's when
I saw rhe arhleric rraining profession: during
rhose injuries ofmy reammares and also dur-
ing rhe injuries rhar I encounrercd. I've always
been inreresred in how rhe human body
worked and in arhlerics. My grandfarher played
minor league baseball and my dad was an
arhlere...so I’ve always had an inreresr in am-
lerics. My exposure ro athletic rraining kind
ofchanged my roure ar rhar poinr.

seen: Whars your philosophyas a trainer?

Silla: Trying ro encourage people to be in-

volvcd In athletics for a lifetime. To make sure
that they understand how to take care ofthem-
selves so they can do the activities imo their
adulthood. I always hate seeing somebody hurt
their knee and rhen realize rhey’re going ro have
some adjusrmenr. But hopefully rhey can ap-
preciare arhlerics and sray wirh lr.

5845: What is a typical day like for you
here?

Silla: Mulri-rask endeavors. Righr now [in
rhe early afrernoonl it could be anyrhing com-
ing in. It could be someone whose had an in-
jury from rbe previous day, since rhis is rhe
besr rimc, before pracrices, for people in come
in and get individual attention. From 5:30 to
430 it’s prepararion for rhe practices: lrs a lor
ofpcople coming in for their daily treatments
or their daily taping.’1‘hat hour is pretty her:-
tic. Then its our warching a practice or con—
rinuing with people inside who are doing re-
hab or exercising in rhe rraining room because
ofrheir injuries or covering a march or some-
thing. sorurdays, Irhe job] could srarr ar nine
in rhe morning and go to six at nighr, very
easily. Right now, both Erin (assistant athletic
trainer Erin Buenzli) and” are doing seven days
a week. We don’t even know what day it is.

5&3: When you are not here, which
doesn'r sound like very orren, do you enjoy
doing?

Silla: I like to go on bike rides. 1 don’t re-
ally have a chance right now; in summer I try

, to catch up onLdiar-el 4%? wg;g_lar rraining l

haven‘t been able res arrhz pincouplc of

- weeks, bur Iwould be doing rr ar leasr rhree or

{our times aweek, ifnm more. I enjoy playing

with some ofmy rummates from rhe Univer-
siry, we just kind ofsruck rogerher for awhile
I like walking my dog our in rhe woods. she
likes to go sivimming. [haven't taken her swim-
ming rhis year, because she also likes ro roll in
the ﬁsh ‘i

5&5: How do Grinnell arlrleries look rhis
year:

Silla: They’re looking really oursranding. I
rhink a Ior of rhe reams and rhe athletes are
doing quite well. I don’t believe me football
ream has been 3-o since I’ve been here; that’s
erciring. The volleyball ream is doing a really
grear job. The women's soccer ream is srrug-
gling a lirrle righr now, due to rhe facr rhar
rhcy have some injuries rhar limir subsrirurion.
I have a grear deal offaidi rhar rhey play hard
when rhey're our there. Thars whar's impor-
ranr. You can do rhar cliche: it’s not wherher
you win or lose, it’s how you play rhe game.
Thars whar D-3 arhlerics is all about: rhe en-
joymenr. It’s grear ro win and ir feels so much
berrer, bur if you can feel good abour your
performance, that's whar is imporranr. That’s
whar I hope rhe arhlcres are able ro do here.

5&3: Whar kind of arrange or oreiring
things have happened to you as a miner?

Silla: 1 can't really rhink ofa srrange one
offhand. A lor of rimes in a game anyrbing,
wherher it's srrange or minor or kind offunny,
rhere is srill a rush in deciding whar [the ark-
lete] can do—wherher rhey can ger back in or
nor.

A pair or overrime vicrories last weekend

Nearly a week ro prepare for a crucial Mid-
wesr Conference opponenr may be a welcome
sign for rhe Crinnell College women's soccer
ream. The pioneers, who dropped rwo league
conresrs lasr weekend, hope ro regain their
srride when rlrey hosr Lake Foresr on Sarurday
and rhen rravel to Graceland for a game on
sunday.

Currenrly Crinnell is clinging so a 4-2
league mark and hoping ro compere in rhe con.
ference four-ream championship ar rhc end of
rhe season. sr. Norberr and Lawrence are 5-0,
Carroll is 4-1 and Lake Foresr is 2-1.

“This is an imporranr week for us,“ ex-
plained Coach l-Iearher Banning. “We need
ro defend our home rurfbcforc complering our
conference schedule on rhe road ar Ripon and
Carroll."

Lasr week rhe ream was faced wirh rhree
imporranr conference marches. on Wednes-
day rhey downed Monmourh, 4-0, bur sarur-
day Sr. Norberr prevailed, 3.0, and Lawrence
defeared the pioneers on Sunday, 2-1.

At Monmourh the pioneers rooka 1.0 lead
inro halftime on an Ellie Graham goal. Cra-
ham slid rhe ball by she Monmourh keeper off
a pass from Amy Walrers, who had received

The coach also praised fresh-

Despire being dominnred
by St. Norberr in rhe frrsr

fending champions ro a 0-0

Norberr scored three goals in
rhe firsr ren minurcs. The

played very well in the lasr

age a score.

“The beginning of rhe

When the Grinnell College football ream

1997 league champion Carroll ar 1:30 on
Rosenhloom Field.

sarurday's conresr will be part of Family
Weekend acriviries ar Grinnell. Head Coach
Greg Wallace commenced, “We played ar home
last year during Family Weekend and we re.
ceived wonderful supporr from rhe campus
communiry and visirors. I think Sarurolay’s
game should provide grear enrerrainmenr and
1 believe rhe addirional specrarors will creare a
wonderful environmenr for borh reams."

In 1997 Carroll downed Crinnell, 20-15,
in rhe rirle game hosred by Grinnell. Carroll
claimed rhe vicrorywirh asrrong running game

rhe Carroll pioneers were picked as rhe favor-

neers were predicred to be runner-up.

Carroll finds irself in a must-win sirua-
rion with an 0-2 srarr inconference play. The
Grinnell pioneers are 2-0 and hoping ro sray
in frrsr place along wieh 5r. Norberr and
Ripon. “Just because Carroll has rwo losses
doesn’t mean rhey are nor good. In her, rhey
are rhe besr ream we've seen ro dare. Also,
rhey will be frghring ro stay alive in rhe rirle
hunr. We have played fairly well so far, bur
ro bear Carroll we'll have to be very good,"
explained Wallace.

Lasr weekend rhe pioneers played rheir

a one-rouchdown VlCtary, 39-3 I, an Lake For-
