Frozen Water Tower
Nelson 'sinforrnation comes in [he form
ofa Letter to the Editor which has been
appropriated by Around. Arountl‘sfllllx
par concerned the name of Ilic north/south
railroad which rims through Grinncll and
Around was way off.

Says Nelson:

“A reccnt ‘Aroulid the Town‘ article
featured a picture ofa water tower on the
old M&Stl. (Minneapolis and St. Louis)
Railroad in Crime”.

“It mentioned that the M&St.L. IS now
the C&NW (Chicago and Nonliwcstem).
This is incorrect.

“For better or for worse, the Chicago
and Nonhwcstem has JO] ned the M&St.L.
in the ranks oftlic Fallcn Railroad Flags.
The Northwestcm was purchased by the
Union Paciﬁc Apn‘l 27, 1995, which now
is the north/south railroad through town.

“Recently, a Denver Rio Grande Wcstr
cm (Rio Grandc) locomotive has been
lravcrsingthc tracks of Grinncll. It. too, is
a Fallen Flag and a nicmbcr oftlic Union
Paciﬁc ﬂcclaspanofUP’spurchasc ofthc
Sotithem Paciﬁc in August, 1996.

“Some other Fallen Flags that are part of
the Union Pacific are, among others, Mis»
soun Pacific (Mo-Pac), Missouri-Kansas»
Texas (MKT), Weslcnt Pacific, Chicago
and Great Weslcm and parts of the Rock
Island but NOT thc cast/west llnc through

tion of the local city routes to the
GART would be a win-win situation
while offering a beautiful and Safe

nicely tie everything together."

Bill Molison, who prepared a suc-

phase ofGART when he was execu—

federal funding exists.

Bike club discusses project

At a recent meeting oftlie Grinncll
Bicycle Club, members discussed the
pOSSible extension of the trail to an
area capable of accommodating ve-
hicles.

The City Council is involved be-
cause ofthe fact that the grant process
requires a governmental entity to be
involved in the application.

project are the city, Gnnncllzooo, the
bike club, the Iowa Department of
Transportation and both the Poweshiek
and Jasper county boardsof supervi-
