Clinton’s Plan
Invokes Empathy

By Howard B. Horn

 

 

about President Bill Clinton’s program to aid college students

who are presently burdened by the high costs of education.
Clinton’s program calls for students to do domestic projects such
as working as a teacher or police officer for two years. In return, the
government will pay for the student‘s college education. Many stu-
dents believe that it” the government can get this program started soon,
current college students can put in their two years of service and not
have to worry about paying student loans or tuition for the restof their
college career. This is not the case. The plan calls for prospective
students to do service before their college education begins. Also. the
program will start small with only a few pilot programs that will not get
into full swing until after
Clinton’s present term. In other
words, all students presently en-
rolled at Grinnell College (and

all other colleges and universi-
ties for that matter) will not be

directly affected by it.

So then,why should we sup-
port a program that will be part
of a $244 billion tax increase
when the benefits of itdo not directly affect us? One reason—empathy.

Many of us have struggled through high school and summer jobs
ﬂipping hamburgers or bagging groceries to make money for college.
Some of us have had to watch our parents struggle to make ends meet
only to have to deal with the additional expense of college tuition.
Almost all of us have had to get on the phone with the Financial Aid
Ofﬁce begging them to send a few more dollars our way. And after
graduation, we will have to suffer the consequences of our student
loans as we try to make it in our ﬂedgling careers.

If Clinton’s domestic corps program is successful, those students
entering college in the year 2000 and beyond won’t have to suffer
through the same problems we did. And maybe one day, when we are
parents ourselves, we won'thavetoincur thesame burdensour parents
do today,

FIRST things first. It’s time to correct a few misconceptions

. why should we sup-
port a program that will
be part of a $244 billion

tax Increase when the
beneﬁts of It do not

dlrectly affect us? One
reason—empathy."

To the Managers of Bob‘s:

I'mgoingtosaysomedlingthat‘ll
make me pretty unpopular on the
west side of the Grilligood job!
Don’tmindalltheﬂakyou’regetting
for it. It was a wise decision, so, stick
to your guns.

You know, I‘m actually really
pissed about all the hype you guys
havebeengetting
about it. It really
shows what kind
of age we live in;
nobody has any
respect for their
leadersanymorc.
How do they ex-
pect you guys to
make choices if no one is going to
respect them? Put a curtain up. It's
your choice.

If you want, ban smoking altor
gether. Do what you want. If you
want to restrict inhaling, I'll only
exhale at Bob‘s. And I’ll even buy a
bagel... It‘s your choice, and I won‘t
give you any crap.

I’ll hate smokers and spy on them
if you want. They are the enemy!

To the Editor:

Maybe some of you saw me last
Friday night, making a fool out of
myself.1waswanderingaroundcam-

It was all a reaction
to Ms. Meyer's letter to the editor,
andMLZlabinger’s“adverl.isement,"
both of which appeared in the Febru-
ary 12th issue of
the 5&8. I was
shocked and ap-
palled, but gen-
erally, I was
amused.

First to deal
with Ms. Meyer.

I see my job at Bob’s as having
three important goals: 1. To provide
the highest quality service (food,
drink,decoration,andentertainment)

tinue to innovate, in order to ensure
Bob’s success in the future I will
continue to pursue these goals until
SGA, Dave McConnell, or Byron
Johnson tell me that this is not the
purpose of my job.

I've never been told that] was a
control freak before, and l’m really
surprised that my friends of ten years
or more never noticed it. I must hand

Finally, Iwish to take issue with
your quotation of my associate and
friend, Byron Johnson. There was a
suggestion made about smoking,

As for Mr. Zlabingcr, all I can
say is:“Whatever.” If you ask me.

tasteless waste of moncy at that. i
