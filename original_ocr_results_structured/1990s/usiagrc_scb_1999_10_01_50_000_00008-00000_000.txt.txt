Hispanic Heritage Month is Here!!

By David Nathan
Staff Writer

“Iowa is a ctilture of its own,” said
Gamaliel “Gama" Dominguez ‘02. ”[It’s]
entirely different from the Mexican come
mtinity I grew up in. m used to being
around a lot of other Latinos. It’s a Very
different atmosphere here. My high school
was about 80% [Latino],"

Dominguez, from California, isn't the
only Grinnellian who misses his old com-
munity. “There are smells and food that
we have baclt home [that we don’t have in
Grinnell],’Y said Student Organization of
Latinas/Latinos (SOL) President Maureen
Alvidrez ‘01.

Many Latino and Latina students deal
with the Iowa prairie by joining one of
Gtinnell’s five organizations oriented to-
ward Hispanic culture: SOL, The Latino
Leadership Project, (LLP), Baile, lsla and
step. In addition, they celebrate Hispanic
Heritage Month.

“Basically, Hispanic Heritage Month
was created not too long ago for Latinos
in the United States to celebrate whzit our
culture is all about,” said SOL Vice Presic
dent Claudia Gonzalez ‘02. “We have a
culture that is as significant in the us, as
othet groups, it is a part orAmetican cul-
ture and we are proud ofthat cultuie ”

Hispanic Heritage Month is an annual
event that runs from Sept. 15 through Oct.
15. SOL has already sponsored a Harris
dance and held several events. This month,
SOL will host several other events as well

(see sidebar).

Before she came to Grinnell, Gonzalez
was an active organizer of Hispanic Heri»
rage events in her hometown of Housmn,
Texas. There, the Latino community was
much larger, “about 25% [Latinol,” she
said, but the events were similar to those
held in Grinnell.

"What we do here are cultural events,”
said Gonzalez. “[But] we also have food,
we also have speakers. We celebrate with a
lot of pride."

uParties, parties, parties too," Alviclrez
said ofthe month. “We like to party."

it is unclear why Hispanic Heritage
Month stretches across two months. One
reason could be to symbolize the mixed
culture that makes up Hispanic heritage.

Through memberefforts, activities and
events such as Hispanic Heritage Month,
501. is expanding its role on Campus from
simply an ethnic organization to a campus
resource. SOL’s office, located in the bases
ment of the Forum near the SGA office,
contains shelves ofbooks, CD3 and films
that Maureen Alvldrez wants to make ace
cessible to all of campus through listing
them in the online Burling catalogue. It is
a slow process, however. because the col.
leetion is large, and despite the Feet that
SOL has over 70 members, the office does
not have a computer. This means that in
order to be catalogued, the books, CDs,
and films have to be brought to ARI-l or
Bul'ling Library.

"We wanted it to be a resource for the

entire campus,” said Alvidrez. “lrsomeone
was doing a research project, we've got a
lot ofthings [they could usel."

SOL and its partner organizations all
“have a Latino focus, but they are open to
everyone. We really like having other
people involved with us," said Gonzalez.

Winfrey said she's wanted
to teach since fourth grade.
Unable to avoid her usual

with a media circus on her way
into the Allen Center two

hours before class.

Later, even the students
became part of the media
