According to Dean of Faculty
Charla Duke, the college generally
adds two to three faculty a year.

were to be added to each department
to accommodate the seminar pro-
posal, then 23 new faculty members
would have to be added. Therefore,
said Duke, the senior seminar pro-
gram does notdirectly translate into
a new faculty member for each de-
partment.

Some recognize this argument but
maintain that current faculty size is
an issue not to be overlooked. “If we
had to do it with the faculty size we

Pro-Life Group:
Is Existence
Fact or Fallacy?

By Craig Wacker

”It's not a Mike Kent produCe
lion,"saidMikeKentaftcrrecciving
the blame for last week's campus
memo message describing a new .
proalife organimtion. The Feb. 6
listing for thepro-lile groupangered
several readers with its insulting
treatment of pro-choice views.

Amy Miller, whose computer user
name was listed in the announce-
ment, denied writing the message.
Kent later admitted to writing it.

Miller admitted approaching Kent
with an interest in finding students
associated with a possible prorlifc
support group. She said she gave
Kent her post-office box number so
Lhatinformation could bechanneled
to her, but she did not know that
Mike Kentwould associatehername
with the memo message,

The other box number listed in
thecampusmemobelongwtoMaria
Walinski. Walinski said she had
informed Kent that she did not want
an administrative position in the
proposed pro-life group. Kent,
however, claimed Walinski had
approached him expressing interest
in having such a position. He added
that Walinski “gave permission to
use her mailbox," Walinski denied
granting that permission.

The existence of the organization
listed in the memo is also question-
able. Miiler and Walinski, the two
mentioned in the message, have
denied the deﬁnitive existence of
such an organization. Kent has also
denied reponsibility forfounding the
questionable operation.
