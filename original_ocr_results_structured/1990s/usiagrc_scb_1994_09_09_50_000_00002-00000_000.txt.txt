participate in off-campus study

H]: Grinnell off~campus study
program offers students the
chance to experience a com-

pletely new culture. Off-campus
study Director Richard Bright says
that the program is important be-
cause, “Grinnell is pretty enclosed.
The offrcampus study program ale
lows students to broaden their expe-
rience.”

Over 150Gr‘innellians study oifr
campus each year. Fonyrﬁvb per-
centof each graduating class has off-
campus study experience.

One of the reasons so many
Grinnellians have gone off campus is
the wide range of places to visit.
StudentscanchooseoneofGrinnell’s
featured programs or an alternative
program.

Each of the featured programs
has an adviser who is able to provide
infomation about the program and
the country where it is to the student,

If students want to choose a pio—
gram different from those Grinnell
offers, they may. The college has
pamphlets and places to write to ob-
tain information about alternative
progams. Shidenichoices are virtu-

To apply for off-campus study
students must first petition Grinnell
for a leave of absence. The petition
states where they wantto go and why.
Students need an intended major to
go abroad. The student must also
have aminimum grade point average
of2.75. All petitions mustbe filed by
February 1001.

After the petition is accepted in
March. students apply to the actual
off—campus study program. Bright
said that most Grinnell students are
accepted because of Grinnell’s ex-
cel lent reputation. Most students rcr
ceivc their replies from the programs

in late April or early May.

The price of oflrcampus study is
determined by the program. Students
receiving financial aid at Grinnell re-
ceive the same percentage of aid as
they would if they stayed at Gn'nncll.

Bright had two pieces of advice
for students. The first is to get as
much of the application process done
by Christmas Break as possible. The
second is to set up an interview with
him by November, The lntcrvicw is
mandatory for all students going off-
campus and Bright’s calendar fills up

Grinnell students have an op-
ponunity to reap the beneﬁts of the
campus renovations that took place
this school year. These renovations
include both ordinary repairs and
complete overhauls, costing the
school over 3.5 million dollars total,
according to Waldo Walker, the Di-
rector of Facilities Management at
Grinnell.

The largest and most expensive
projectundenakcn by the school was
an overhaul of Goodnow Hall. a
buildingdatingtoGrinneIl'scarliest
years as a college. Its price tag
accounts for $2.2 million of these
repairs and will house the Anthro-

he said. “It’s worthy of renovation
and should be used to its fullest."
Sophomore Jen Collins disagreed
“They shouldn't have restored

Goodnow. Much ofits characterhas
been lost in the rcnovative process."
she said.

Beside Goodnow, many smaller
renovations have been made. Those

The rest of the repairs regard seasonal
upkeep. "Ihe college has to keep up

Despite these numerous
changes, some students would still
like to see more improvements. “1

and Drug Abuse Training Board

Though the program received
some criticism from students at the
time, it has since been modified and
IS now offered as an elective work-
shop. Student staff, RLC's. mem—
bers of the Alcohol and Drug Board
and interested students are strongly
encouraged to attend the workshops.

Krohn hesitates to say that Grinr
ncll has a drinking problem, though
she does state that students sonic-
timcs make bad choices.

“1 think people are sometimes
making bad decisions about drink-
ing,” she said. “I can't urge enough
thatwejustwantstudcntstobcaware
of what they're doing. Underage
drinking is not the issue here."

Approximately eight to eleven
Grinncll students end up at Ihe hospi-
tal each academic year, according to
Krohn, mostly due to concerned
friendsnnd RLCs. Each time,ainem»
ber of Student Affairs or an RLC is
there to offer support and advice.

Students who believe that they
have a problem can call Student Af-
fairs or the local chapter of Alcohol-
ics Anonymous.

Krohn urges interested students
to attend the SATUCi workshop.
“They never say ‘Don‘tdrink.’ Thcy
JuSlSZIy ‘Understand your own limits
and risk factors."’

The second SATUCI workshop
will be held Wednesday at 7 pm. A
repeat of last week‘s introductory
lecture will be held from 5 pm. to 7
pm. for those who missed the first
one.
