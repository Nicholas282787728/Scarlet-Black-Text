l'm sorry to disappoint those of
you who were eagerly awaiting my
response to Dave Hatzfeld’s letter
from last week’s issue. Actually,
this column will notbe about camr
pus politics or social issues at all.
This week’s topic is thinking, a sub
ject near and dear to this column.
When we closely examine the way
we think, we can learn a lot not only
about ourselves. but about the na
ture of die world we live in, which
may not be what it seems.

Biologically, our thoughts are
byproducts of the physical world
we live in. Our mind is a definite
substance which contains electror
chemicalpatiemsarrangedinacomr
plex network. This network is sus-
tained by substances from the out
side world such as food and liquids;
it is inﬂuenced by our environment
through the reception and process
ing of sensory input. When this
network interrelates with itself. it
brings about self-reflection or con
sciousness.

The mind is also capable of
creating images or imagineering.
These images may or may not re

means something. When aperson attacks
a teacher, accusing that teacher of being a
conununist. solely because that teacher
recognizes that the United States has not
always been very nice to the rest of the
world, that means something. When a
person categorically assigns the qualities
of violence and drug abuse to an entire
ethnic group, and thus blames that group
for its own suffering under a racially
biasedeoonomic system. thatmeans some
thing. Peoplehavc amuseer.Washbum
of being a racist, of having written coir
umns which have been insulting to Afri-
can-Americans. I cannot speak for any-
one other than mysclf, but ifl were black,
I think that I would fell pretty insulted.
although, admittedly, Mr. Washbum has
never written anything blatantly racist—
he has ncvcruscd the term “nigger"in any
of his columns. That is not meant to
defend Mr. Washbum, however.
Furthermore. I take exception to Mr.
Washbum‘s constant. hypocritical coni-
plainis about the poor writing ofhis critr
ics. I think that he should pay more aticn-
Lion to the flaws within his own columns.
I disagree with the editorial which rip.

tophcr Fletcher claimed that Mr,

willingly and frequently (ad iiauseum) in

cannot help but wonder, however. if all

For Mr. Washbum, l have two sug-
gestions, If he plans to continuedisparagr
ing his opponents for their notrquiic-pcr-
fectly crafted letters and arguments, the
he should eilher improve the quality of his
own arguments and articles, or, other
wise, make an cf fort to make some kind of
worthwhile response to their criUCisms of
his ownwork. And ifhcplans to Continue

he should Llunk about making his own

For anyone who does not like what
Mr. Washbum hits to say in lllS articles, I
have another very different suggestion,
Please remember that he, Just like every

one also, hat a right to express freely his
ideas. The facithatlic docs so in aprovoczir

not at all give anyone the right to demand
that he be removed from the staff of the

anyone the right to steal and hide copies of
The Grime-II Spectator. Those are Ihc kind
of policies and practices which were made
famous by such enemies of life in Adolf
Hitler, Josef Stalin, Joseph McCarthy, and
Roy Cohn, and i doubt that anyone would
wish to emulate them. Mike Washbum is
no more intelligent than anyone else on this
campus, nor is he really any better a writer
If, at some point, soniconc at this school
actually writes an intelligent article dcr
fending the theses wtuch Mr, Washbum
tries vainly to support in tits articles, then
perhaps people should pay more attention
to that person's writings. But I have yet to
see that happen,

Entine rails against apathy,
slams faculty, administration

To the editor:

With the recent visit by the
Zywickis,Icouldn'thclpbutrcincinr

faculty and administration throughr
outthe search forTammy. President
Ferguson and the rest of the adminis-
tration. especially Facilities Manage
mcnt. wcre very responsive in pro
viding faxes,posiageand photocopy—
mg. In addition, the time and energy
put forth by the Public Rclations Of-
ficc was outstanding. However. do
nations of personal time and effort
wcrc scarce to say the least. Even the
small efforts were strictly personal:
as far as I know, no collective action
was taken. The adminisuation and
faculty could have organized fund-
raising among the dcpartmcnts and
helped to distribute flyers, especially
co ‘idcring that the faculty and ad-
ministration liave access to more cars
on campus. in this way, their paniClr
pation could have had an enormous
impact on the search cffort. Most
professors did not mention Tammy's
murder in class nor did they pause in
their scholastic activities to adyust
syllabi for the many students who
were behind in their work. Then at
the reception for tthyWickis,only a
handfulof faculty Clinic to show their
support. Iam fully aware that not all
the faculty and administration have
been apathetic, but those who have
been VISlbly involved have been the
exception. Astonishing is the com-
parison between students’ efforts and
support. many of whom did not even
know Tammy. and the
administration’s lack ofinitiative. For
students. we lost a roommate, a hall
member, and a friend. How can the
faculty and administration overlook
this, as well as the fact that Tammy
was an advised,sludcnl,alhlctc,phor
togrtipher and member of our com
munity? lam appalledby.andcannot
comprehend, the degree of apathy
exhibited by the faculty and adminis-
tnition. It is intcrcsting that. as stu
dents, we are supposed to admire and
emulate our clders; yet, ironically, it
has been the students who have taken
theinitiativcand subsequentactionm
not only Tammy‘s case but also im-
pomntconlempomryissuesandprobr

lems. Unfortunately, this has not
been the only incident in which the
arlminisuationand faculty have failed
to become visibly involved. The re
action to the Persian Gulf War, the
Rodney King incident, the assaults
on and offcampus, the campaign for
the ERA, Women Take Back the
Night and many other issues and
events have received minimal atten—
tion. The faculty and administration
ought to examine their contributions
to our community at large. inside and
outside of the Classroom and office.
During criSis situations, the campus
community should try to go beyond
traditional distinctions between stu-
dents and adminstiation, Even though
faculty and administration members
have other obligations such as class
preparations and family, there are
times in which these commiunents
must be put aside as we all work
together for a common cause.

EDITORIAL
Give it up,
guy-bashers

To whata pathetic state the guy-
huting fringe on this campus has been
reduced: lcavingjuvcnile graffiti on
posted notices. committing cowardly
telephone harassment and shouting
“ aggot” in the street. Witii their
contemptible fight all but lost, they
have demeaned themselves in their
silly efforts to demcan others.

While the battle for decency and
principleinthissocietyishardlywon,
wethinkthatwecanperinitourselvcs
a little bubbling of schadenfreude as
the enemies of decency and principle
on the issue of sexual orientation,
before the end of this decade, go
down to total defeat, a complete
knockout. Instead ofbcing too l'ctir-
ful or angry when we see something
like the instances of antirgay graffiti
on south campus, we might instead
(whilcstillmaintainingaprudentvigir
lance) raise our glasses in a prvVlCr
tory toast: the enemy is terminally
sick and no one will be present at the
reading of the will.
