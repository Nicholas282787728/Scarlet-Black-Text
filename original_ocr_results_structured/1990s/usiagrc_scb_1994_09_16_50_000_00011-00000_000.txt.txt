beating up on only hours earlier?

Grinnell's rugby teams may be the

place for you.

TheGriffinsandl-larpies(men’s
and women‘s teams, respectively)
have long been apart of the Grinnell
club sports scene. Although they are
not an ofﬁcral part of the Grinnell
athletic department, they travel to
tournaments allovcrthestateinboth
the fall and spring.

Rugbyisasportthathasachieved
moderate popularity in the United
States despite its European origins.
Colleges all across the country have
rugby clubs, and some even have
leagues. The objectof the sport is to
advance the ball past the goal line,
like American football. The ball can
be advanced up the field by means of
lateral passes, kicks, and simply run~
ning with the ball. A score (“try") is
worth five points. and is followed by
a two~point kick.

Both Grinnell teams are always
looking for players. According to
Iggy Perillo, who is a member of the
Harpies. “No skill of any kind is
necessary The team looks good
this year. We had an instructional
practice at Iowa and that should help
with technical things.”

Eric Eisenman, president of the
Griffins, also encourages students to
come out for the learn. “Things are
looking good for us this year, be-
cause we gotJimbo [Sadler] back as
coach. We still have to ‘borrow‘
players from our opponents most of
the time, though. Rugby is a good
sport to do that in Since you get to
know the opposing players after the
games, it‘s pretty friendly.”

Pl‘ttsch called “flat.” In 95degree

bets saw action for Grinnell.

The Pioneers opened the scoring
late in the first half on a goal by
backup left wing Lubabalo Balulu.
Later,Neil Goodspeed scored to give
Grinnell a 2-0 lead at intermission.
Goodspeed managed to score despite
being double and triple-teamed for
most of the game. ‘They were in-
timidated by Goodspeed," explained
Pfitsch. “Because of that, they
showed him respect by packing the
defense all around him.“

Late in the second half the Pio-

neers added two more goals, the ﬁrst
by freshman Dimiter Georgiev and
the other by Jacob Kain.

The Pioneers will face an ex-
tremely talented Luther squad this
weekend. According to Much, the
game could have lastingimplications
as the winnercould end up with a bid
to the national playoffs “if every
thing else falls into place this sea»

Asked to reveal his team’s strata

must stay on an even keel. We still
have not been tested, and we need to
keep improving until we can form a
