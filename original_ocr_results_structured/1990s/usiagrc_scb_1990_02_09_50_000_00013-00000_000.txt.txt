Williams Dares Students to Seize the Day
. DEADPQETS

By Bill Warburton

The year is 1959 and the
setting is the Welton Academy. a
small boys‘ school nestled in the
Vermont countryside. This is the
place where all the rich boys go.

The education is steeped in
staid, traditional values.
Conservative thought pervades
the air. Rules are strict and
enforced, and everyone is doing
what their parents tell them to
do. In many ways, this is the
Anti-Grinnell.

Enter Robin Williams. He‘s
the new poetry teacher (John
Kenting) . Is iJ1iS a comedy’.7
No. In fact it’s a somewhat
depressing drama. But Williams
is still funny. And his acting is
quite good. However depressing.
the movie is a must see.

Keating is a rebel. A former
student at Welton, he is
determined to teach his students
in the fashion he seems best.
Screw the old, codgy instructors
and narrow-minded administrators
of the established order, The first
thing he tells his students to do
is tear out the introductory
section to their poetry anthology.
Though hesitant at first, the boys
come to revel in the destruction
of the books. But it is all for a
purpose. You see. the chapter is
a detailed explanation of how

poetry is best analyzed with the
help of malliematics.

In this manner, Keatings
helps to foster a sense of
rebelliousness amongst his
students. “Carpe Diem" (seize
the day) is the principle he
professes. “Tomorrow.“ he
slates. “we will all be food for

 

worms. The boys are extremely
inﬂuenced by this. and as the
movie progresses, proceed to do
whatever they feel like doing.
They begin to live for the
moment. take risks, and defy
parental guidance.

In the Spirit of this new-found
philosophy towards life. the boys

resurrect the Dead Poet's Society.
a club initially founded by
Kcating when he was a student.
The goal of the society is to
sneak through the woods in the
middle of the night, climb into a
cave, and read poetry. Sounds
like fun, huh? Intoxicated with

their daring and adventure. they
all seem to have a wonderful
time.

Three boys play crucial roles
in the plot: Neal Perry (Robert
Sean Leonard), aboy domineered
by an overbearing father: Todd
Anderson (Ethan Hawke), a shy
and inhibited newcomer to
Welton; and Charlie Dalton (Gale
Hansen), a rebel eager for
instruction. It is interesting to
see how Keating changes each of
their lives.

The movie was directed by
Peter Weir, who directed Witnm.
The Year cht'virlg Dangerously,
and Mosquito Coast. If you have
seen any of his previous movies,
you know he will put you
through the wringcr, But it is
well worth it. His movies tend
to inspire deep thought. and leave
a lasting impression. In this
respect, Dead Poet's Society is
more of an experience than an
entertainment

The movie is one of the best
of 1989. See it and you will be
glad you did.

Japanese
Drama: Illusion
and Reality

Rarhomort, a famous
Japanese suspense drama, incites
moral inquiry as the viewer is
asked to decipher between four
different versions of a rape and
murder mystery. The slory takes
place in medieval Japan in a time
of famine and civil turmoil. The
twisted plot involves a suicidal
nobleman, a raped wife, a dead
husband, and a notorious bandit.

The movie approaches the
relationship between illusion and
reality in the form of an allegory
about failure and weakness, This
film is heralded for its universal
parables to humankind and the
supreme visual metaphors
produced in its cinematography.
