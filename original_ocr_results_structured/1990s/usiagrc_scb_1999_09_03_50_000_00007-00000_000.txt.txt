lhercbygivc my annual address
of the state of the Crlnnell College
Community, founded in 1846, and
of Fall Sport at Grinnell. just as old:

The State of Grinnell

Grinnell has changed radi—
ally—of course everything here has
to be alittle bit radical, rightiL—in the
past three months. Several incredibly
astute students have noted the disape
pcarance ofthe three “coolest" things
about our Iowa homatead—Jimbo’s,
VAX, the Pub—and the addition of
McDonald’s (“Those corporations are
incorrigible! What’s next? Burger
Kinglz”).

Acommonly heard quote from
this year's sage upperclassmen is, “last
year things were different. l come
back and lhardly recognize this place!

It’s like a tornado came throughlll"

Well, 1 don’t want to risk
sounding too much like an old man
(“Those kids next door are incortic
giblel Why don’t they just turn that
loud rap music downl?"), butl think
I will bay at the moon ofsports past
for just a little while.

The state ofFall sport

Last year, the Crinnell football
team didn't play games. They held
public executions. so did the
women’s tennis team. The only fat
guy you ever saw at a men‘s Cross»
country meet was the one with no
shirt, wearingablackrnaskand pants,
and carrying a twicetsharpcned axe
and a wicker basket with the Honor-
G emblem on it.

Those three conference cham-
pions weren't the only teams that were
successful. The volleyhall players
powered their way to their best seat
son ever and a secondplacc finish in
conference. The women’s golf team

boasted a regional champion in first.
year Hilary Mlnnick. The women’s
crosscountry runners and both sane
ccr teams also finished respectably in
conference. It was certainly a great
season for pioneer sports.

It seems like the chances-of
improving the fall sports scenery at
Grinncll are as likely as changing the
backdrop ofthc family photo at Mt.
Rushmore ("No President Ford. you
do not get a spot"). The Pope is more
likely to get locked out oftheVatican,
right?

Nope. Read these preview ar-
ticles and the articles for next week,
go to a game, check out the
scoreboard, and be reassured. And
then go get a Big Mac.

The quality oisport at Crinnell
will not undergo d1: gale-force winds
ofchange. Ar least not this year. So.
lift your face up and enjpy the pleas»

like Reese Wirherspoon so much. out
she was not as annoying to me as usual
in this one.

A: We all knew people like Reese
in high school...the ones you wanted
to see hit by a bus. To see it on film is
cathartic. The fact that it’s a teacher
ruining this life makes it all the more
enjoyable and original.

C: So, I’m really enjoying this
movie (except for the fact that a guy
with a really big head is in front of me
and can't seem to remain in one posi.
tion. so I’m bobbing and weaving
throughout it). but then the moviejust
got really long and wouldn't end. I’d
say the first hour and a half is good,
but l could have done without the last
half—hour. .

A: I've got nothing left to say,
except for the Minnesota accents every
character usesi Hello? The school is

C: Yah sure. You betcha.
