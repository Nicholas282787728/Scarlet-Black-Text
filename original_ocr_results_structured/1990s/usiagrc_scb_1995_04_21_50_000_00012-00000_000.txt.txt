Students should consider
consequences when asking
for “open-mindedness”
Time and time again, I hear membcts of
the Grinncll community profess mat we,
as responsible constituents of a “liberal"
academic environment, have a commie
meat to OanrmindC/dncss. I have heard
his rhetoric ofbeing open toall types and
degrees of political opinion spoken in
classes, in personal discussions between
students and also in the S & B quite a bit
recently.

It is time for us to deﬁne what we
mean when we use the word “libcnl " I
was just musing over this subject in ass
lhismoming. Can we posstbly mean that
we accept all points or View? Are we
actually interested in welcoming conser-
vative and ulu‘a-Conscrvuljvc viewpoints
into thecuirentGi-rnnell society alongside
the leftrwing politics which we already
espouse? If we weic to seriously listen to
every voice which asked to be heard,
rather than selectively considering urosc
which are more or less in sync wtlli our
political agenda, what would happen to
the social climate which we have worked
so hard to create here on our campus?

It is not difﬁcult to tell that Gnrnicll is
a campus which is politically oriented
towards the left The leﬁrieanlng tenden-
cies of the Grinncll community are a
major part orour identity, theper am not

too far off the mark when I say that it is
Griiiiicll‘s leflrwlng ﬂavor which attracts
students who are simply seeking a social
scene in which they will be true to be as
wacky or offrlherwall as diey want to be.
Grinnell maintains its politically progres-
sive orientation so that it can continue to

“liberal," 1 always simply assume that
niey mean “lettwing.” Never have i
thought Grinncll to be a school which
accepts all points of view, nor a place
whichevcnmakcsanefforttoenconipass
the entire political spectrum. It doesn’t
seem possible to me tor Grinncll or any
where else to maintain it strong political
identity wtthout choosing between right
and left. Grinnell has chosen lett and
seems to be staying that way.

So, students, be careful when you
talkaboutcnnncll havingacomntiunent
to “opennnndedness.” There are some
vocal conservatives here. and [hey have
every nght to speak their minds. How-
ever, Grinncll retains its lcl‘twing cccellr

Student clariﬁes meaning
of cruciﬁxion posters,
apologizes for offense

On Friday, April 14, InterVarsity Chris-
tian Fellowship sponsored a rcrenaclr
merit of the cmcifixion ofJesus, It was
my responsibility to make sure that the
eventwaspublicized, Oflhctcn different
signs posted throughout the week, one
read as toilews:

history.

His m stands ill the ccnterofsomc
peoples hearts‘ and lives.
In my haste, I made two errors. You may
have noticed them, the ﬁrsterror is more
subtle. “His m stands at the center of
history," In tennsofmw numbers, this is
inaccurate, Bocauseol'dte varicdhtston»
cal expenences ot the nrany cultures
represented on this campus, this state
ment does not make an accurate claim.

The intention of this statement was
not to offend. nor was its purpose to
belittle anyonc’s beliefs or experience,
In fact. care waslaken to presentonly our
beliefs asjusttltal: ourbellcfs aboulwhat
the death of Jesus means. The motivzh
tion for this statement stems from the
beliefcontained tn the second half: To
Christians, the death of Jesus was the
central event in history,

For oriense taken by anyone, 1 am
sorry and do make a for-trial apology.

The second error? As any English
majorcantcll you, the use ofapostrophes
[is] awful.
