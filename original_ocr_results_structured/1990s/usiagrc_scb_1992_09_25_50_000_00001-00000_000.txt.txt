S&B cuts budget by $8,000, increases ad revenue

Through cost-cutting and revr
smile-raising, IheScarletSc Black will
save the Student Government Asso-
ciation more than $8000 this fall.
According to last spring semester’s
budget, SGA support for the newspaA
per totalled $10,060. The Student
Publications and Radio Committee
(SPARC) approved this week a new
budget for the paper which calls for
only $1825 of SGA support.

Under the editorial direction of
Christopher Fletcher and the busi-
ness managmentof Matthew Sinclair-
Day, the Scarlet 5t Black has taken
signiﬁcant steps toward becoming a
real business This, according to
Fletcher, is a radical departure from
thepast. “In previous yws,theS&B
has had virtually unlimited funding
from SGA. This served, we think, to
create a cavalier attitude toward the
business aspects of running a news—
paperiand make no mistake: a news
paper, whatever its content, is a busi-
ness and profit is the goal."

Fletcher said that when he ex-
am ined Scarlet & Black budgets from
years past, thcnumbers made nosense
to him,particularlytheprintingcosts.
“I knew from my previous experir
once with newspaper and magazine
publishing that it just doesn’t cost
eightornine hundred dollarsan issue
to print 2000 copies of a little paper
like the 58:11 That huge cost was
justifiable back when all the produc-
tion work was being downtown [at
the Gi‘innell Herald-Register]. We
had to pay them for use of their facile
ity. But now we have a production
facilty on campus and everything we
need to prepare a newspaper for print-
ing."

Fletcher, having been warned
by the SPARC last spring when he
recived his appointment as editor—in-
chief that the paper’s budget would
be smaller, he investigated costrculr
ting options Said Fletcher, “l gath-
ered quotes from several other print»
ing companies, They all beat the
Herald by four to five hundred dol-

larsperprintrun. ldidn’tundcrstand
why. “ Fletcher said that he dis-
cussed the matter with Al Pinder,
Grinncll Herald-Register publisher,
and Finder explained that the extra
charges were for keeping his facility
open for Ihe Scarletdt Black’s use all
night on Thursday nights. This in
cluded giving the staff access to the
building and use of the machines.
Pinderandﬂewheragreedmatheuce-
fonh the newspaper would do all of
its production work on campus and
that the Scarlet St Black would pur-
chase only photo screening and print-
ing services from the community
newspaper. “This is where we saved
the big money. it cut our printing
budget in half,“ said Fletcher. Ac
cording to Fletcher, the Scarlet &
Black’s previous budget called for
31 1,500 for printing alone. Fletcher
said that this semester’s total ex,
penses, including staff salaries, will
be less than $8000. “And 6000 of
that will be covered by ad revenue."

Overseeing the newspaper's
ambitious revenue-raising, Sinclairr
Day is optimistic and committed to
the new program. “One thing that is
definitely different from last year,"
he said, “is that this is no longer a
subsidized operation. We‘renottalkr
ing about socialism. The SELB is a
business and it is beingrun like one."
Sinclair-Day pointed out that pro»
duction decisions, such as how many
pages the week‘s issue will be, are
based now not on the amount of copy
the paper has but on whether the
issuewillbreakevenormakea profit.

“This is the only sensible way to
do it,” Fletcher said. “If we fall
behind revenue projections, then we
may have to do an eight-pager when
we’d rather do twelve. If we get
ahead on revenue, then maybe we
can afford to do a sixteen-pager. The
importantpoinlis thatthtspaperruns
on a very definite budget, and we
have no intention of deﬁcit-spend-
ing "

' WhileFletcherandSinclair-Day

concede that their revenue goal will
be tough to meet, they anticipate sucr
cess. Sinclaieray said that some
businesses in Grinnell have been re-
luctant to spend money on ads in the
Scarlet & Black, citing the bad busi-
ness climate. “But overall, we are
doing well,” said Sinclair-Day, “and
if we don't exactly meet our projec-
tion, we will certainly come pretty
close."

Sinclair-Day mentioned some of
Lhechallenges he faced when hiredas
the newspaper‘s business manager.
He said that he had to virtually start
from scratch. “There were very few

records" to give him any indication
of what had been done last semester.
he explained. ”It is my impression,
however, that the S&B did a fairly
good job of getting the ads, but they
did a very poor job of maintaining
those accounts and making those ads
pay. Much evidence exists thatmoney
was never collected, especially on
the national ad accounts." He also
said that numerous checks received
late last semester were never depos—
ited. “We're talking mousands of
dollars in uncollected monies." He
estimates that nearly $1000 in in
come may have been lost to the Scar-

let & Black last semester becasue
proofs of publication were never sent
in to the paper’snational ad agencies

“When I returned to Grinnell in
August,” said Fletcher, “the box was
stuffed with warning notices and
deadlines, advising us to send the
required proof of publication imme-
diately. All the deadlines, sadly,
passed in J one We will never allow
this to happen again,"

Said Sinclair-Day, “We are
learning very quickly. I empathize
with their siuiation last year; it takes

by Alexander Kambouroglou

Bruno Sanchez, the French lan-
guage assistant, is no longer part of
the Grinnell College community.
Yesterday, he woke up at eight
o'clock in the morning and prepared
for his ten o’clock Advanced Oral
Expression Class which he teaches
with the Associate Professor of
French Janice Gross. After class he
went down town to get his groceries,
and was back in his room in the

French house by noon. It was about
then when he received acall from the
secretary of Charles Duke. Vice-
President of Academic Affairs and
Dean of the Faculty, who asked
Sanchez to attend a 1:30 p.m. meet-
ing in Nollen house where the Vice—
President’s officeis located. At 1:30
pm. he met with Tom Crady, Dean
of Student Affairs, and Duke, Ac-
cording to Sanchez, he was then in-

formed that he had been dismissed
from the College on the charges of
using drugs with students, using at-
cohol, and not leaving a woman’s
room when told to. Sanchez was told
lovacate hisroom byfiveo‘clockthe
same afternoon. He then went back
to the French house topack and move
out, while being monitored by
diree male Resident Advisers. Said
Sanchez, he is not allowed to come
on College property again. The locks
to French house were changed, and
new keys were issued to the resi-
dents.

PresidentParnelaFerguson,who
happened to bepassing by the French
house on her way home at five
o'clock, said that she was aware of
the fact, and that she was obviously
in agreement since the College was
already taking action; however. she
refused to comment any further on
the dismissal of Sanchez. Assistant
professorSusan lreland, whowas the
only person in the French Depart—
ment to be found, refused to com-
ment. Jennifer Krohn, Assosiate
Dean of StudentAffairs, also refused
to comment Attempts to talk to
Dean Duke were unsaccessful since
