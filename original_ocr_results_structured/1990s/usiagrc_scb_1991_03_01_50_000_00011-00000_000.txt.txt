In order to fulfill the various

McAdory’s SGA: the “voice
and power of the students"

By Adrienne McAdory

Last spring I was literally thmst
into SGA when I became the SGA
Administrative Coordinator, had to
attend my first meeting and franti-
cally record the meeting for the
perusal of the whole campus as
official SGA Minutes. 1 was ini-
tially confused and doubtful that I
could cope. Yet. I’m still here
plugging away, hopefully more ef-
ﬁcientandinformatjve than when I
started.

WhyamlrunningforSGAVieer
President? Becauselfeelloweitto
myself to take the next step in my
continuing commitment to make
the Grinnell Student Government
Association the voice and diepower
of students. After observing SGA
for almost a year and noting the
pressure on the President and Vice-
President as representatives of the
student body as well as leaders, I
was still unsure iflhis was my goal
but always in the back of my mind
was a yearning. A yearning to
participate in the excitement of
knowing that you are looking after
worthy interests and supporting and
being supported by your peers and
friends,

Is it possible to represent cv-
cryone? I want to say yes,and I feel
I can say yes, First, you have to

create avenues for slu-
dentsiomaketheirposi-
lions known and I feel
the avenues are here on
this campus. Then, you
have to weigh the alter-
natives and make the
best or only decision
possible given those ale
tematives. This policy
Seemsobvious,butdur-
ing the course of events
in SGA. I’ve found the
obvious can become
blurred and l articulate
this philosophy for my
benefit as well as yours
because as Vice—Presi-
dent I must keep it in
mind. There is a ten-
dency to only see your
view which is avenues
for dialogue are essential to my
future position.

I feel i have been preparing for
the vice-presidency fortwo years. I
have been and still am involved in
too many activities for my own
good in an effort to understand
Grinnell and the students' place in
Grinnell. 1 was a Student Adviser
fora year. Ihave been a memberof
the Office of Community Rights,
which mediates problems between
students that are not taken to Judir
eial Council, for two years. I was
