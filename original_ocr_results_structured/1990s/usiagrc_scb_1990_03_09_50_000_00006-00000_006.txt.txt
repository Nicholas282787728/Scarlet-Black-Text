Scarlet&Black SGA Election Supplement

CHANGE: Fernandez-McCarthy Discusses Future

continued from page 5

like to take alook at that.

What have you contributed to the
campusand how do you feel that
you have represented student in-
terests in that contribution?

This year I'm a student advisor.
I was also, on the Student—Staff
Selection Committee, which my
opponent, Scott, was also on. I’m
also a member of the Office of
Community Rights, which is a
mediating team somewhat similar
toludco,exceptwedon‘tprosecute.

I’m also amember of the Harris
Center Committee, which is also
mentioned on the statement of intent.
That has honestly given me the
opportunity to meetmost. if notall,
of the colleges top administrators,
which is obviously going to be a
benefit ifl’m going to getelected. I
can come up to George Drake, or
Wally Walker, orany ofthepeople
in the Student Affairs Office. such
as Steven I ones or Tom Crady, and
speak to them aboutjust arty issue.
so Iwon't have to become familiar
wiLh who the administrators are and
what their personalities are. I’m
already well aware of that.

What has SGA lacked that you
can provide?

I think SGA is, and can be,a
very effective organization.
Unfortunately, I think that a lot of
students perceive that SGA is a bit

removcd, which is not the case I
mean anyone that goes out of their
way. even a little bit, to deal with
SGAwillseethatitisanorganizaLion
that is really interested in the
students.

Now that may, in pan, be a
reﬂection of the attitudes of the
people that are currently in office.
However,IsLilldon'l think that it’s
visible enough. The president and
vice-president have to go out of
their way to make the presidency a
lot more visible, so students know
that we are indeed putting in the
work. That is one of the reasons
why, as part of my campaign
promise, one of my campaign
promises. I would like to write
columns in the Scarlet and Black
every other week. I also want the
official Joint Board minutes [U be
computerized, so all the students
have access to everything the
senators have access to.

Why was it that you chose to take
on the responsib ties of an SA
"contrary to the advice who
knew" you,when your goal was to
be SGA president?

The reason Istated that is because
student advisers obvtously cannot
holda cabinetposition. Peoplethat
are student advisors oftentimes
will not feel the 11ch to attend
Joint Board meetings, for example,
because they are not required to,
obviously. So, LIS a rule, if you are
a student advisor and you cannot
holdan SGA position, you can’t

be acabinet member, you can’t be
a senator. oftentimes. people will
assume that you are not involved
with SGA in any way. and that of
course might hurt your candidacy.

However, I have still gone out
ofmy way tobeinvolved with SGA.
Again, I am on the Harris Center
Committee.l’veauendedeveryJoint
Board meeting, I maintained close
Contact with Rob (Killion). Alanna
Tyler, and Tom Main just to get a
very idea of how SGA works.

The reason I wanted tobeanSA
is bmausc itreally interested me I
felt that, this year, I would get more
personal satisfaction out of become
ing an SA than outofholding some
cabinet position. But I still had the
goal of the presidency in mind.

Why would you be a successful
correspondent with the college’s
administration and faculty?

I would be a successful corre-
spondentwith the administration in
thesense thatIalreadyknowmostof
the administrators. Again from the
Harris Center Committee. I'm
familiar with all the administrators.
Being a student advisor and being
on the Student»Staff Selection
Committee, I‘m very familiar with
StudentAffairs. I speak with Steven
Jones, associate dean of Student
Affairs, often, with Tom Crady.
Again, I’m also a member of the
Office of Community Rights, sol
have a very good idea of how
SludcnlAithirs works and how ac-
cessible they are to students. I know
most of these people

3-2: Jeffrey Sees Program As "Top Priority"

continued from page 5

though, helping that along, sort of
making sure that stays top priority. I
see it as a good program. I drink it
gives our institution. makes us ap-
pear like a big research institution.
It’s the thing that makes U. Penn. U.
Cal. Berkeley, and U. of Iowa at-
tract much better faculty. It can be
productive if we get more facultyr
That's the kind of thingI want to be
working towards in upcoming
years. I want to make sure that it's
paid attention to, and that if the
school, indeed, intends to keep 3-2,
they do it in a way that it still helps
the student as well as helping
the teachers. I think also we attract
a higherqualily vitae bank by exist
ing in what would be, I guess. a
research institution, if you could say
that for a college of this size.

I think also, this is sonofrelative
to how SGA relates now to student
body,in that, we’re viewed sonofas
a parent organization. and it‘s very
parochial. That is, studentorganiza-
tions and students feel they only
have to come, that they come to
SGA for money, in particular. And
I feel that that takes a lot of power
from SGA. When I say power, I
mean its power to inﬂuence and is
power to help. and sort of augment
the college campus.

Also, town-gown relations. Right
now, we have some good things

going on. in terms of toy-drives,
activity in their parades, things like
actually getting in contact with the
mayor, those sons of things Bull
think,formefuture,we’vehad,again
and again, and I've only been here
two years, problems with things
happening to students on campus
I’m not cenain, of course, who the
perpetrators have been in thesethings
are, but there’s always the possibil-
iry that they might be from within
the town or outside of the Grinnell
College community, So we obvi~
Ously have to deal betterr I think
some of the things that I would like
to see, in particular, is us, SGA,
helping sponsor, us actually going
outinto musing homes, more people
into Big Brodters/‘Big Sisters, and
thatcould mean sometimes the cabi-
net. because I think its a really
powerful thing when the SGA cabia
net from Grinnell College actually
comes out and does an activity. I
think that's good, Itmakes us look
good. I mean what we do is repre-
sent the student body, and it makes
us look like an interesting group of
people. 1 think we should also get
together. and this sort of ties in with
how we’re viewed by student or»
ganizations, for instance, with Morv
tar Board. which currently sponsors
different programs to actually work
within the town, like in tire nursing
home and in the pre-school. We
couldgetinvolved with them, We'd

advertiscfor them.sponsoring some
advertisement, probably, or possi-
bly, in the S and B, or just directly
through the minutes or other ways.
I think we should search for bet-
ter ways to relate with the busi-
nesses, as well. Now, I don‘t really
have any speciﬁc programs as to
how that can be done, but I think
there can be some correspondence
between us and businesses and pay»
ing attention. in particular, to the
businesses that cater directly to us,
so we can sort of mention them
when something may come up of
interest. If students want to buy
eightrmillion balloons, we might
know the best place to buy out in
balloons. S and B-sponsored adver-
tisement for high school events, and,
like I said, I'd like to continue actiV<
ity in the homecoming parade, the
toy drive, canned-food drives. and
sort of anything else, that I think
would actually help out the town.
helpout the students, and,in general,
make us all relate better. There’s a
lot that can still be done in thatarea.

What have you contributed to the
campus, and how do you feel that
you have represented sludent in-
terests in that contribution?

When I was senator, I sat on the
Afﬁrmative Action Advisory Board,

TOWN-GOWN: Truesdell
Encourages More Interaction

continued from page S

that the group that needs to be tar-
geted is the high school-age popula»
tion. That’s the area where most of
the friction is occurring. I think
what’s most important in resolving
this friction is getting the students at
Grinnell College in touch with high
school students. The interaction
between the two parties needs to be
increased. There's numerous ways
to do this. Get high school students
involved with our political organi-
zations. For example, PAFA—l'm
sure there are people at Grinnell
High School who are interested in
PAFA’s ideas, theirissues, and their
concerns, and who would love to
stananorganization similarloPAFA
at their school. Maybe let the high
school students use our facilities—
for example, our athletic facilities.
our theater facilitiesito get them
on campus to see that we‘re not this
big chancre sore in the middle of
town. Maybe let them compete in
our special interest leagues. One
thing that I feel would be a lIcmcnv
dous success is something along the
lines of Career Dayisct aside a
Saturday afternoon where students
would come and talk to professors
and students, and bring up any qucsr
lions related to going to college,
what to major in, what to do with
your life, what's it like being a col-
lege student, that sort ofthing.

In summary, the most important
thing is that there needs to be in-
creased interaction between college
students and high school students
because neither side knows much
about the other.

Security is another higissue that's
hot on campus now. First and fore-
most. lighting on campus needs to
be improved tremendously. It‘s
ridiculous that a Crime“ College
student can‘t walk across campus in
the middle of Iowa andnot feel safe.
They need to not only increase the
number of lights on campus, but
they need to change the lights them-
selves We‘ve been told that they
addressed the issue, and there are
changes that are going to be made.
But they have not been made yet, I
think that it's impomnt I don‘t
know whatthcy’rowaiting for. They
need to have that done now. The
instances ofattacks and assaults are
occun‘ingn'ght now. We don’thave
time to sit and wait for the lights to
getchangedr That will be one ofthe
firstthings I willpush ifI‘m elected.

Housing is also a big issue right
now They're talking about build—
ing a new dorm. I think that’s ﬁne if
it‘s not an excuse to increase emoll-
menl, if it will fit into the scheme of
utmpus and will actually serve a
purpose in reducing overcrowding.
Rightnow theadmissionsofﬁcesays
that the reason there’s overcrowd-
ing is because the unpredictability
of the number of students that will
be on campus. I ﬁnd it hard to
believe that the addition of a new
dorm will increase their accuracy in

predicting the number of students.
Dean Crady mentionedlthat the rea-
son thc new dorm would be built
would be to compensate for three
lost off-campus houses. I don’t
understand how that's going to do
crease overcrowding. I feel that if
great care is undertaken whcn look»
ing atthesubjcct. then Lhenew dorm
would benefit the college, and it
would improve the overcrowding
situation.

Basically, those arejust three of
the topics are feel right now are
pressing. I can't. and no one can,
predict what the issues will be next
year. Ican‘tsaylwilladdrcssissues
next ycar because some of them
haven’t occurred yet,

What have you contributed tothe
campus, and how do you feel that
you have represented student in-
terests in that contribution?

This is my second year on stu-
dentstaff. BeinganSAlastyearand
an HAC this year. I feel there’s no
better way to interact with other
students. I meet with them on a
personal level. I feel that that is the
was to get an understanding of their
concerns, the issues that are impor-
tanttothem. Ifyouwanttoconslrler
organizing hall activities. counscl-
ing as an SA, and working on cur-
riculum ideas with the SEPC as
contributionstostudents,dtcnlthink
those in themselves are pretty im-

pressive.

What has SGA lacked that you
can provide?

lfeel that SGA has done a good
job overall, It's a popular problem
that everyone says exists—the
communication between the students
and SGA, and between the students
and the administration. I feel that
the communication between SGA
and the students needs to be im-
proved by whatever means neces—
sary. Once that gap is bridged. then
that will increase Lhc communica
tion between the administration and
the students, which is in fact what]
believe is SGA's, and most speciﬁr
cally, the president’s. key roleas the ‘
liaison between the students and the .
administration.

lfyou knewofyour interest in stu-
dent government, then why have-
n‘t you been involved in SGA?

As I pointed out in my statement .
of intent, student staff members are
prohibitedfrom participating in SGA
as a senator, a cabinet member, etc. >
I felt I could geta better understand-
ing of college life, of student life,
student concerns, with the interac-
tions that take place here in being a
student adviser and a hall activities
coordinator. I feel that those have
prepared me very well for taking an
ofﬁce such as presidenL ‘
