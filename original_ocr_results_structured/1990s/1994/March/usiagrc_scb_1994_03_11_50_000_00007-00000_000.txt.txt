Wednesday. March 16, with

The Purple Death From Outer Space
ComcartdcniisewithHashandthecrew.
Showtime is 9:15 pm. in Nonh Lounge.
The film may be enoyed from at
least three perspectives: simply as
cult-fun ﬁlms:aslegitimateexamples
ofearly ﬁlm direction; and as nostal—

gic reminders of the atmosphere of

. excitement which characterized the

early movie houses where these “se»
rials" were shown.

Buster Crabbe, who plays Flash,
was originally an Olympic athlete.
Contemporary directors of science
fiction film have paid tribute to the
earlyFlash Gordons,saying thatwith-
out them, Star Trek and Star Wars
would have had a “much more difﬁr
culljoumey into the future.”

Flutist Sarah Moore, a first-year
student from Denver, Colorado, will
perform Poem for Flute and Orches-
u-a, a piece by the American com»
poser Charles Tomlinson Griffes.
Mezzo-soprano Donna House, a
sophomore from Muscatine, Iowa,
will perform excerpts from Bizet’s
Carmen. CellistDanieiWeiss,afirst-
ycar student from Houston, Texas,
willpresenttheSaint-Saens Concerto
for Cello and Orchestra. Finally,
harpist Catherine Mendelsohn, a se-
niorfrom Albequerque,NewMexico,
will perform the Concerto for Harp
and Orchestra by Dittcrsdort‘.

Mostolthesoloists have studied
music since they were in elementary
school. They often played their in
struments with school bands and or-
chestras, and House sang with the
school choir. Why they originally
chose to study their particular instru-
ments varies among them.

“Isawapictureoftheharpin the
music room at school and announced

to my mother that I wanted to play,”
said Mendelsohn.

Moore’s reasoning was similar.
“I chose the ﬂute because I had a
next-door neighbor who played the
ﬂute and I thought it was just a neat
kindoffeminineinstrumenttoplayi
l was not a tomboy."

Most of the soloists expressed
excitement when asked about the
upcoming concert “It is somewhat
like it dream that I get to play a
concerto with an orchestra," com-
mented Mcndelsohn. “I love to per
form and share my somewhat un-
usual instrument with other people."

“I'm very excited about the con-
cert" said House. “I thirikit'simpossible
to have put a lot of work into pieces of
music and not be excited about the per-
formance. lthasbeenarealueatiormc
