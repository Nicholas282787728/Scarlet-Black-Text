Gay historian combines
rights and ideas of French
philosopher in lecture

By Emiliano Battista
and Scott Samuelson

N Monday, Aprtl 18, in
South Lounge, David
Halpertn presented his

paper “The Quecr Politics of
Michel Foucault," part of an up
coming book entitled Saint Fou-
cault. Halperin is a gay historian
and theorist currently teaching at
Cornell University who has pub-
lished numerous books and ar~

the gay rights movement. His
work. intellectually and politi—

tive code. but instead challenges
normative values in order to open
new possibilities and solutions
toourproblems.Thts sortolpoli—
tics,t’or Halperin,notcs how “per
sonal” experience is constructed
by the “political.”

In realizing that the political
sphere bears heavily upon the
sexual, Halperin suggested an
“aesthetics of existence,“ a way
of living artfully that abandons
reason and tradition in favor of
seeking the internal differences
that mark the sell.
