S &B Presidential Endorsement
a Threat to Democracy

Dear Editor:

This is in reference to the
S&B’s editorial endorsementof
Aaron Fate in last week‘s isA
suer We condemn this action
by the editorial board as inapr
propriate and inconsiderate,be»
cause it gives one candidate an
unfair advantage over the 0th
crs. We write notas supporters
of a particular candidate, but
as concerned students for de-
mocracy on campus.

First, theS&B is nota“pri-
vale" newspaper like the New
York Timer or the Grinnell
Spectator, but the only and of-
ficial newspaper of Grinnell
College This implies that the
paper should equally represent
theintcrestofall students. But
by its blanket endorsement of
Aaron Fate last week, the pa-
per is promoting him and his
constituencyoverhisopponent.
And that is a grave disservice
to Monica Horton and her supr
porters.

Second, SGA elections
arecovered only by the 5&3, un-
like the local, state and national
elections that are covered by a
plethora ofmedia: TV,radio, and
numerous newspapers. Being the
sole media to report election cam-
paigns, the 5&3 carries much
more weight on an election out-
come than most other newspa-
pers would. This makes it even
more critical and necessary that
the 5&3 ls objective in its cover-
age of elections. Writing does
the contrary, by making the en-
dorsed candidate become the in-
stant favorite.

We understand that the 5&5
has in the past endorsed candi-
dates, but it is time for the paper
to know that this practice is un-
democratic and only undermines
SGA elections, at least in the
Grinnell context. This is an at-
tempt to censor our credible
newspaper. It is a call to more
fairness and objectivity; it is 2t
call for more respect and sensi-
tivity to the democratic rights of

all Grinnellians. On the con-
trary, if this editorial policy of
endorsing is to continue, then
our future election campaigns
would come down to lobbying
or buying the endorsement of
the editorial board.

To the editorial board: In
future elections, it should be
enough to tell us who the can—
didates are and what they stand
for. butnotwho to votefor. To
do this is to uphold democracy,
but to do otherwise is to adu-
mantly insist on tilting elec-
tion outcome to your wishes.
Democracy should not fail in
the very institution that es-
pouses its tenets. Where is Bob
Grey?
