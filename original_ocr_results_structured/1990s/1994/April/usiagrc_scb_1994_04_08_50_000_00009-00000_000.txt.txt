Student questioned
for possession

Bag ofParaguayart tea mistaken for marijuana

By Jim Kropa

UNIOR Dan Sharp was srtung
under a tree, enjoying the warm

Friday afternoon sun when he
found out that he’d been caught.

A friend had overheard people
in Burling library talking about the
potpipeandstash foundnearSharp‘s
jacket the night before.

The news came as a rather scary
surprise to Sharp. “She came up to
me, and she was super serious," he
said, recalling how he was informed
of the discovery. “For the longest
time, t thoughtshe was joking," said
Sharp.

But it wasn‘t ajoke. The news
was conﬁrmed when Sharp checked
his e-mail.

“Tom Crady had written me a
message saying that I should come
talk to him regarding my ‘belong-
ings.” Sharp said.

Mistaken Identity

It ﬁnally occurred to Sharp what
had happened A a case of mistaken
identity. The bag of dried green
leaves that library workers discovV
ered was not marijuana at all, but a
kind of Paraguayan tea called yerba
mater

Because the tea is a highly
caffeinated beverage. it comes in
handy for Sharp. “Before midsems,
the week before break, it’s what i
drank to keep me awake," he ex-
plained.

The apparatus mistaken fora pot
pipe was a strainer called a bombilla
used for drinking the tea without a
teabag. The top of the bambilla re»
semhles a pipe stem.

Sharp remembered that on the
Thursday before break, he had an
imporan exam in the afternoon. So.
hedranksomeyerbamatcwilh break-
fast. went to the library to study and
rushed directly from the library to the
exam.

“In the processI leftall my stuff,
including my jacket which is dis

tinctive enough for the librarians to
recognize," said Sharp. He also left
behind his bombilla and some tea.

Following his exam, Sharp did
not return to the library. Freed from
the pressure of the test. he said he
forgot abouthispossessions. “I left it
there overnight, and it was cleaned
out of the cartel where I was work—
ing," he said.

Dean of Students Tom Crady
receivedacomplaintregardingSharp
thenextday,and summoned Sharp to
come speak with him. “I didn’t ac-
cuse him of anything," Crady said,
“We had not contacted the police."

Upon receiving the message
Sharp took his guampa, the special
cup fordrinkingteausingabombilla,
to show to Crady, along with a kilo
gram bag ofyerba male that Sharp
purchased from a Brazilian import
store in Minneapolis.

“My roommate wanted to come
with me because he thought it would
be hilarious, so he just sat in the back
of the roomand giggled,“ Sharp said

Themisunderstanding cleared up
quickly, and Sharp ptaisedCrady for
his [air handling of the situation. “He
was mellow about it," said Sharp.

Grinnell‘s Drug Policy

Crady handled the complaint
against Sharp according to the
College’sofficialpolicyontheuseof
alcohol and illicit drugs. found on
pages 6366 of the Student Handr
book.

“The Federal Government re—
quires us to take action any time
somebody violates the alcohol and
drug policy,” Crady said.

According to Federal Law, in
order to receive funding andaid from
the government, an institution of
higher education such as Grinnell
must have“standards of conductthat
clearly prohibit, at a minimum, the
unlawfulpossession,use,ordistribu»
tion of illicit drugs and alcohol by Its

students and employees ..."

Letters from the Old World

Part VIII—Glasgow

By Riva Sharples
JASON and I hadn't been back at Iancaster University long before we felt the urge to travel again. This

 

 

time, we headed north into the cold Scottish countryside to Glasgow, the third»most visited

place in the United Kingdom. Our trip was something i will never forget, to say the least

Jason and I had been planning to go to Dublin that particular weekend, but after we ventured to the travel
agency and discovered that it would take us nearly eight hours to get to Ireland (four on a train and four on a
ferry to Dublin), wedecided that we didn’twant to travel that far, especime since neither of us could leave until
4:00 pm. Instead, we once again decided to get on the next train going to a large city, so we threw some clothes
into our packs and took off on the 1655 for Glasgow.

The first indication that our trip was going to be miserable was while we were still on tlte train. There was
a draft coming from the windows and Icouldn’tget warm. Nortnally, the pains are so hot(kind oflikethe dorm
rooms at Grinnell) that I break a sweat, so I wasn‘t prepared to be cold. Spoiled by balmy. spring-like weather
in Lancaster, I hadn’t packed for winter weather. I hadn’t even brought my sweater, gloves or hat. Jason and
[ﬁgured we would be fine After all we would take taxis and public transportation

We pulled into Central Station on Gordon Street and joined the queue waiting for taxis We were finally
taken to theGlasgow Youth Hostel in abeautiful, hilly section of townthatrem irided mealittle of San Francisco

“So where are you from?” Our cabbie was friendly and wanted to talk with us as he zoomed around the
curving streets to the hostel. We had to strain to understand his accent. The difference in accents between the
British and the Scottish is amazing. The Scottish accent is much stronger, rougher and heartier-sounding. Even
the British accent varies greatly between north and south: the nonh‘s is much heavier. But this cabbie’s accent
was the worst we had heard. “The states." we replied. “Really“! My cousin’s new wife has been to California
before,“ he told us proudly. Then he chuckled. "So what brings you to Glasgow? This isn‘treally the best time
of year to visit." “Oh, it's ﬁne," I said, telling him that I was a hardy Midwestemer, and used to severe cold
and lots of snow. Itdidn’t seem that bad. Sure. my hands were numb, hutthere was no snow on the ground.

The Glasgow hostel was the nicest we have stayed in. Once an old hotel, it still looked much like a hotel
inside with a nice restaurant, TV lounge and laundry facilities Instead of the dorm rooms and communal
bathrooms typical of most hostels. this one had private bathrooms, single and double rooms and still only cost
ten pounds a night, including a breakfast of bread, cheese andjami From our room on the third ﬂoor, the view
was breathtaking and we could see out over the city for miles. of course, at night all we could see were the
identical bright yellow lights that are. used in streetlights, house lights and signs everywhere, and tend to give
all cities a monotonous, uniform look.

Jason and I dumped our stuff at the hostel and then walked in the direction of what we thought might be
the town center. without a map. We passed several movie theaters with long lines of people outside, waiting
to get into “Wayne's World II". “Schindler's List" and “Aladdin" Jason and I ended up at a nightclub called
the Equinox, located on aback-alley street. We‘d run into friendly Scottish blokes ata pub earlier that evening,
and they had told us that the Equinox was the place to go. It was located in the basement of an old warehouse
and decorated in a chain motif. There were cages all over the dance ﬂoor and handcuffs for sale at die bar.
Leather jackets and shaved heads seemed to be the ‘in" thing at this club and, actually, throughout Scotland.

On Friday, weheaded out early from the youth hostel toBuchananStreet'sritzy shops. We were impressed,
but left after our jeans and dirty sneakers attracted suspicious looksi We found George Square, which is
Glasgow’s feeble attempt to imitate London's Trafalgaquuare, and toured the City Chambers building, which
contains the longest marble staircase in the United Kingdom, among other impressive items and statistics.

Later that afternoon, it was turning frigid and the clouds were an ominous gray colorr We didn‘tpay much
mind, however, and headed back to the youth hostel to change for a night out on the town. When we emerged
from the youth hostel an hour later, there were two inches of slush on the ground and it was coming down so
fastl could barely see two feet in front of me. Suddenly, Jason and I weren’t dressed very appropriately I was
wearing a miniskirt, nylons and boots with heels. He worea silky butnot very warm shin and his spring trench
coat. We decided to avoid the weather and take a taxi, but because we didn‘t know where we were going. we
ended up searching fruitlessly for a pub or nightclub in downtown Glasgow. We wandered for two hours, and
got totally drenched. My feet were so cold that it was difficult to walk; Jason‘s ears were bright red and
undoubtedly frostbiuen. When we finally found a place, we were soaked to the bone, and sick. Thinking that
we had been stupid but would remedy the situation quickly, we decided to grab a cab, go back to the hostel and
enjoy a nice evening there. But the snow was coming down even faster and all the taxis were full. We stood
on the streetcomer shivering and finally found an empty one, but it couldn't take us to the hostel because it was
on the top ofa hill. The streets were so slushy that buses, taxis and automobiles had basically stopped running.

We ended up walking back to the hostel. We were cold, wet, hungry and frustrated. We decided we didn’t
like Glasgow anymore, and we left the nextday, bright and early. For once, I was happy to be back in Lancaster!
