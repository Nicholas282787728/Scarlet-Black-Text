For many of us in theLatino Comm unity, fits the very sound of ournames
at times makes it difﬁcult to receive the beneﬁts that many of the White

Editor:

senthatthcrcal threattodcmocracy in this country stems from those who would

Two other disturbing issues in last week‘s letter to the Editor caught my

npaigns” is grossly wrong. The debate the night before elections and the
toments of intentappearing in every dorm oncarnpuswcre two major sources

Finally, I would like to issue the Editor and the staff of 5&8 a warning.

Dear Editor:

I would like to respond to the
editorial letterlastweek“S&B Presir
dential Endorsement a'l'hreat to De-
mocracy.”

My simple question: how?

Onecanargueihatanewspaper’s
editorial may be badly written. or that
it may advocate a wrong headed posiv
tion,but, to maintain ihata newspaper
should not editorialize at all, and that
exercising this prerogative is ”a grave
disservice” to the Grinnell commu»
nity, is simply misgiided and wrong
Aneditoriat (or, for thatmatter. a letter
totheeditor),rathcrthanbeinga“threat
to democracy," is in fact central to it.

The point is made that the 5&8
is not a “private” newspaper and
hence should “equally represent the
interests of all students." But by
vicwingthewritingofan editorial as
an act of promoting or not promotr
ing certain student constituencies,
the authors miss entirely the more
basic pointofan editorial: to engage
in a dialogue over a given issue.
Their assumption is: we can't dis-
cuss this or that because of the way
it affects a given constituency. The
crrorthelettcrwriters make(anditis
a most grievous one) is in placing
more importance on the effects of a
given position on a frozen set of
constituencies than on the validity
oftheidcas contained in the position
itself, If ideas didn’t have certain
implications, implications that at
times affect people or “constituenr
cies,"itwould seem ratherpointlcss
to deal with them.

Now, the letter writers argue
that the 5&8 has a uniquely central
placeincampusmediaanddialogue,
and hence should not espouse an
opinion(otherthanonethat“equally
represent[s] the interests of all the
students'Lassuming. of course that
an exchange of ideas is not in the
“interests of all students"). But the
way to“uphold democracy" (I apolor

gize ifthc language here seemsabit

ciﬁcally in something like an SGA
election, is to reduce the centrality
of the 5&3 by offering other forums
(study breaks, statements of intent
with actual content, door to door
campaigning, a candidates debate
with more than 50 attendees) in

which to hash out opinions and posi-
tions

In the end, I hope that the au-
thors reﬂect on just how illiberal
their “attempt to censor our credible
newspaper" is, and, at base. how
undemocratic.
