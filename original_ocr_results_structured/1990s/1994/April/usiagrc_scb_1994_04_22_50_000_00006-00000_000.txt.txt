“Thebrillianceofthe play is that

Despite its humor, though, he said thc
play has “serious intent,” and that the
audience would be moved.

“It’s finally not a trivial piece,“
he said. According to Moffctt, the
play makes audiences feel ”contem»

Rajki‘s, and she’s been taking art
classes since high school. Many of
these classes havc been taught at the
prestigious Cleveland institute of Art;
most recently wasan otl portnutpaint»
ing course anki took there last sum-
mer. ”Thatwas something thatgotmc
interested in doing a study of per-
uoils." said Rayki.

Here at Grinncll, anki has taken
a 200710vel dmwing course taught by
Professor Robert McKibbin. in addi
tion, Rajki is currently pursuing an
independent study of pastel portraits
undchcKibbin,throughwhichanki
has produced the works now on dis-
play. “McKibbin,”saidRajki,”ishelp-

ful and encouraging. He is willin
devote a lot of time to his stude
telling you what he likes about yt
work and in what ways you can i
prove it."

Many of Rajki's displaycdpas
portraits nreof faces, and Rajk
that she has a special interest
uaying faces. She finds them “es
cially expressive and revealing."

Women are the subject of all
the displayed work, According
Rajki, one reason for this is that i
much easier to ﬁnd female mod-
“But,” Rajki admitted, “women .
more beautiful to draw than men."

The show consists of the p -
ously mentioned facial dtawings
series of gestural full-figure portm
as well as a series of self»pon.tar
which are Rajki’s favorites. This
mostly because they are easier:
feels “free to take her time and to
more relaxed about the outcome."
