"The play is about how people
work together to create the realities
they exist in,“ stated senior Susan
McBumey, the play’s director.

ﬁed by their ambiguous feelings about
society’s rules: “The things that re-
strain them also protect them,“
McBumcy said.

Playwright Lorca‘s outspokenr
ness about the contradictory nature of
life in 1930’s Spain made him some-
what of a revolutionary. “He really
didn’t like the idea of art for art’s
sake,“McBurneysaid. “I-Iefeltthatif

Lorca dedicated the play to the
women living in Spanish villages at

shortly after the play was finished.
”To some extent, he was murdered for
the ideas he put forth in his play," said
McBumey.

According to McBumey, Lorca
used the play to commenton activism
and protest. “We uphold martyrs who

“It’s an incredible script," she added.

McBumey said Lorca made the
issues “more realistic” by setting the
play in a house in a Spanish village.
“That’s what’s so wonderful about
Lorca: he puts it in an everyday sonof
experience. It’s not ‘The House of

Lion of the political questions of the
play. ”[Lorca] is saying, ‘look atwhat
you're doing,” said McBumey. For
the Grinnell audience, the play’s mes»
sagcmaysoemobvious,butMcBumey
believes that it is more subtle.

“It’s about breaking down those
illusionsithatbrighteyed andbushy-
tailed idealism. At Grinnell, we're
quick to see it thh Christianity...or
capitalism, but we’re slow to see that
in our own lives," McBumey slated.
She posed the question, “What does it
mean to be a nice, friendly feministor
a nice, friendly gay activist? When is
that playing it safe?"

Directing the play, McBumey
said, has changed the way she thinks
about her own decisions. Visiting the
Holocaust Museum in Washington,
DC. over spring break, she said she
was reminded of the play. “It makes
melook at tiledecisions thatI‘ve made
a lot more carefully. It makes me look
at what I allow as acceptable condi-
tions. If I choose to ‘play it safe,‘ what
are the ramiﬁcations of that. ” she said.

is directing is from several different
