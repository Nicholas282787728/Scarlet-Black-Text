podium and then mingled with stu-
dents as they waited in line to regis-
ter.

Campbellis“runningtorestorecred-
ibility to state government."
Campbell listed working towards
adequate funding for education and
finding a solution to crime as her
priorities after taking office She has
served as Attorney General for the
past four years.

Anne Pedersen. candidate for
Secretary of State, has served as Lee
County Auditorfor 12 years. She has
gained experience by co—authoring
several progressive election laws and
administrating local elections. Sheis

concerned about low voter turnout
and proposes to increase interest in
elections by encouraging early vot-
ing and more convenient placement
of ballot boxes. She believes that
positive campaigning rather than
mudslinging will also make people
more interested in voting.

Candidate for the United States
House of Representatives Elaine
Campbell discussed crime, welfare,
and health care as the issues she plans
to address in office. She currently
serves as Secretary of State. Grinnell
graduate Ian Gustafson serves on

As a result of the stroke, Powers
is suffering from total blindness and
swelling of the eyes and brain. Doc»
tors believe that there is some hope
for recovery. according to
Mulholland.

“He gotout [ofthehospitall Mon-
day and at that time he still had con-
siderable swelling in the eyes and
brain," she said,“so there is hope that
he may regain some sight if swelling
decreases, but for the time being, it
sounds as though he suffers from
total blindness."

Powers sewed two years as a
temporary replacement in the Reli-
giousStudiesdepartrnentforon-leave
Professors Harold Kasimow and

Janine Sawada. He became entangled
in a widely publicized controversy
last spring when not hired to fill an
empty position in the deparurlent.

sequenLly accused the college of re
verse discrimination, though the col-
lege claimed that all hiring practices
were fair. Instructor Jonathan Silk
was later hired for the position.

gin teaching at Wright State Univer-
5in in Dayton, Ohio. For now, how-
