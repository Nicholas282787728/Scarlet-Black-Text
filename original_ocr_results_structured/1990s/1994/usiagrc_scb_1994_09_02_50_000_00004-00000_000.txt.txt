By JIM KROPA
Cyclone Editor

OB and Barbara Berry gradu-

B ated from Grinnellover ﬁfty

years ago, so it naturally

surprised them when they read their

names printed in a 1993 article in the
Scarlet & Black.

The article, which appeared in the
April 16, 1994 imte,wasa follow up to
aMarch12,1994 article thatspeculated

campus loggia behind what is now the
Student Publications building.

The inscription read “BB BLM
10/12/38,“ and caught the auention of
5&8 writer and former student Becky
Meyer because her initials were also
BLM. Meyer researched old year-
books and determined that Beatrice
Mills was the best candidate for the
1938 BLM.

Lilligren’s work combines
images of nature and humans

By SARAH STAVETEIG
Staff Writer

HILE wandering down
stairs in the Burling Lie
brary, it is difficult to

avoid stumbling upon one of Ingrid
Lilligren‘s large clay vessels or life
sized prints. Pieces in her collection
of voluminous works stand out in
their size and bright color, and they
immediately capture the viewer's at.-
tention because they combine im-
ages of nature and the human form.
Lilligren’s work is exciting because
it’s not orlly visually enticing. but it
also reﬂects political themes of gen»
der and nature.

“For me, nature is not simply a
stimulantforthe work. Iatn panol‘ it
and my activity as a human is part of
nature. There is no separation, no
dichotomy. Its more of a process
between states of awareness. This
culture sets up separation but in real-
ity we are a part of nature. I believe
that by expanding our understanding
of nature we might stop exploiting it
and respect its limits," said Ingrid
Lilligren in an interview with Susan
Geer, ‘92.

Lilligren's work cenainly com—
bines earthy elements. Many of her
pieces are based on the human shape
and add images of branches and ﬂow-
ing lines “Her work stands out be-
cause oi its ﬂowing and voluptuous
shape," contends Kay Jenkins, Art
Coordinator at the Burling Library.
“Site is a delightful human being
an artist with humor and a deep uni
dcrstanding of natural processes.
Lilligren is one olthe fcw artists who
engages the vicwerso strongly." The

multiriacets of Lilligrcn's work are
pleasing to the eye and evoke images
of nature.

Lilligrcn’s work was brought to
Burling on the suggestion of pottery
prolessorMcrle Zirkle. Lilligren cur
rently teaches pottery at Iowa State
University and conducts adult work-
shops at the ldyllwild School of Mu-

sic and the Arts. She has been re-
viewed in numerous magazines and
newspapers, from ARTWEEK to the
LA. Times. Her work will be on
display at Burling until September
30. and she is coming [0 speak at
Grinnell on September 27. [person
ally encourage you to stop and take a
look at her exhibit.
