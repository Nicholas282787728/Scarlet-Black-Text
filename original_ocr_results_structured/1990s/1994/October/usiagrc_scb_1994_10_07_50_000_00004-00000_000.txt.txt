The soul of music

he commercial purpose or pri

I ority of the music business
contradicts the artistic prior-

ity -- the soul of the music.” Self-
made artist Ani DiFranco was any
thing but compromised during last
night’s concert sponsored by Per-
forming Ans and the Noun Program.
DiFranco danced, made faces,
screamed, whispered and grinned
with the raw individualism that is
only Ani. Owning her own record
company since the age of 19.
DiFrancoinsistsoncontrolling every

aspect of her career: writing. pub-
lishing, producing and creating the
artwork for each of her albums.

Inaninrerview immediately fol-
lowing the concert, DiFranco ex-
plained that although it is a lot of
work andher independent label gives
distributers a “license to ignore“ her.
she offers an alternative to artists
who may not want to sign with a
major record label. but see no other
way to“make it." With the success of
Righteous Babe Records, DiFranco
is “trying to prove that you can re-
main independant and still compete
[in the music business]?

Arts

DiFranco explaind that Righr
teous Babe Records “grew organi-
cally” as each album paid for the
next.

Though Righteous is turning a
proﬁt. marketing is still based on her
hectic routing schedule: “toting my
butt around the country and selling
and playing." Everything, then, that
Ant offers to her fans is herself and
her own.

When asked why she objects to
her style of music being defined as
”women’s music," DiFranco again
displayed her desire to be considered
as an individual. “In an ideal world

we could label ourselves differently,
and I would have no problem with
someone calling my music women's
music. I'm a woman and I play
music." DiFranco explains that she
owes much ofherlife to thewomen's
community. but today the term
women has become a sort of “pi-
geonhole" for ideas so that women
are regarded as if they are a sort of
special interest group.

“Just think of me as a person.
because once you start to think of me
as a woman, you start writing off
everythingl ‘m saying."

DiFranco also stressed the im»

at least they can be related. She
related this view to herdiverse musi»
cal tasle, ranging from Bulgarian
women‘s choirs to House of Pain.
“Not everything I agree with and not
everything I get off on, but there’s
always things that t can get from it"

DiFranco’s individual style, en
ergy and musical force, along with
Andy Stochansky's drumming and
running commentary made for an
evening of music and fun . In person.

as her songs.

The posters themselves are colorful
and emphatic, and combine literary
and visual motives. As art, they don‘t
ﬁt any particular category, and defy
easy description.

This exhibit came to Grinnell
through the intercession of Professor
Mary Lynn Broe, who is not only an
editor and biographer of Ford’s. but has
also spent a gear deal oilirne with him.
Broe describes Ford as a "self—celebmt—

man" who has “balanced hipness with

Broe hypothesizes that Ford has re
mained so unknown andburied today
because he has never fit neatly into
any school of thought, and has acv
tively resisted being identiﬁed with
any one group. ”The gay commu-
nity, for instance, has tried to adopt
him as a speaker for their cause, and
even though he wrote extensively
and openly about being gay, he has
avoided becoming associated with
the aims of the group. He is not a
platform person,” she explained.
