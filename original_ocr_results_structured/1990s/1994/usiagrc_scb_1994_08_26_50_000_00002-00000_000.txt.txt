Ska hits Harris

Dance Hall Crashers,
Pacers, Banana Buster
bring three brands of ska

By JUSTIN GLANVILLE
Feaiures Editor

ANCE Hall Crashers play ska
forpcoplewho don'llike ska,
They also play ska forpooplc

who do like ska. Confused?

Here's Lhe deal. Last year, DHC
reduced the prominence of horns in
their songs, making room for more
guitar. Though they losisomeof iheir
hardcore ska following as a result,
they gained SOOperceniin bLherareas.
”It’s a much more eclchic audience,"
according to vocalist Elyse Rogers.
“Ska tends to sound really poppy and
circuslikc. We’re u'ying 10 get away
from ska but add more to our music.”

Described by some as a fusion of
two games ,, ska and rior girl -- DHC
are fronted by two women singers.
RogersandKarina Schwarz, Thcband
also includes two guiiarisis, a dnlrn-
mcr, and the crippled horn secLionl

California area. where they have an»
joyed huge local sales and airplay of
singles like “Go" and “He Wants Me
Back.“ Like Superchunk, a college
favoriiewhichperfonned here lasiycar,
DHC is mosLly a“singlcs“ band. They
have released only one CD, 1989—
1992, a collacLion of hiis. A ncw
release is presently being recorded.

Rogers sums up DHC'S livc acias
“two women spaczing on stage [Our

music] is not the kind of Iiiing where
people can sii down and listen to it,"
warns Rogers, In fact, ihc band’s
L.A.-arca performances regularly and
in brawls and Lhc scrcaming ofambu-
lance sirens.

Ska is a fast-paced style of music
that first appeared in the 1960’s,and it
contains elements of R&B, jazz, and
Jamaican music. Reggae is a direct
descendant of ska.

The Pacers and Banana Buster
will open tomorrow’s show. which
begins at 9:00 pm. in Han'is Center.
The Pacers‘ are all collcgcrage. and
they are based in Milwaukcc. Having
recently signed lo Epiizlph Records,
thenotorious punk/hardcore labclon'gi-
nailed by lhc lead singer of Bad Reli-
gion, they are becoming more and
more well-known and arc touring on a
naiional basis. The Pacers play a fastr
paced, experimenlal brand of ska. The
keyboardist from Fishbonc produced
the upcoming CD.

Banana Buster is led by Grinnell
sophomore Eric Fischer on guitar and
vocals: the oihermembersarcfmm his
Chicago—area high school. “Since I
learned how 10 play guitar.“ says
Fischer, “and fell in love wiih ska, I‘ve
always wanted to be in a ski band and
go as far as i could with ii." Banana
Buster has a four—son g dcmo under
Lhcir collective bolt; Fischer classiﬁes
their 51m as ihe most undiu'onal of ihc
three bands.

To ihc Editor

The news is filial wuh politics
Lhesedays. Signsarc sluriingtogo up.
Six Democratic candidates have al-
ready visiicd campus. More are com»
ing soon. Campaigns are now in full
swing as the last 90 days to Ilic No-
vember 8 general clccuon go by. This
clociion will be an imporlani. one for
Iowa, wiih all stale-wide offices, the
stats House of chrcscniauvcs, and
half of die slaic Scnaic up for clecLion.
Neiihcr parly has firm conLrol ofaithcr
house of Ihc legislature; ihc gubcmzi-
lorial race is virtually a dead heal.

Willi so much riding on Llus elocr
homing imponanlforcvcryonciogcioui

reasons to vote right hero in Grinncll.
FiisLallGrinncll suldcnisaicwnsidcmd

probably be spending ihc lion's share of
4 years or more in Grinncll, you may a:
wall vote hcrc. ll saves ihe hassle of
mucsling an absentee ballot, ﬁlling ll
out, and mailing it back to home. Fur-

slay up to date on ihings back home.
Obviously. a number of candidalcs are
already showing an inicrcsi in sharing
their views with Grinncll students, as
cvidenaad by their visiis lo campus dur
ing rcgi'simLion. Many more will un—
doublsdly be on campus In moei with
students this fall.

Registering to vote in Grinnell is
also very easy. Registration cards are
very simple in fill ouiiihey are only
the size of a posicard! Undoubtedly,
both political panics will be regisier—
ing voters in the post office, dining
halls, and dams Iowa does not rce
quire citizens to have lived in the slate
for a certain length of time before
voting here: the only requirement is
registering a few weeks before Lhe
clcciion. When registering, you do not
have 10 present proof of idaniiy. Fill-
ing out a postcard is ALL ihai ii takes!

Il is especially imporizini Io vow
