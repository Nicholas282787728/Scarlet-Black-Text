ANS

Stewart said yes, but his manager said no

By Tom Zlabinger
aving intentionally skipped two
teheatsalsanda SPARC meetv
ing last Sunday. I feel that it is
necessary toexplainwhatdmvemeto do
this: I wanted to interview Stewart
Copeland.

Mr.Copeland isoneofahandful of
people that have inspired me to pursue a
career in the music business. And being
theEditor-ln-ChiefoftheStﬂBJ thought
I might be able to swing an interview.

I arrived at Robens Theater at
12:30 p.m.jusl asthe smge crew started
to unload the trucks. I drought maybe if
I hungout the whole day, I might meet
Mr. Copeland Also, I had prepared a list
ofquestions toaskhimthatwouldtztkeall
of 15 minutes

As the day progressed. I saw these
readies nansfonn Robens into a profcsr
siottal venue. The crew worked many
familiarGrinnell faces hard all day long.

And then around 4:30 pm, when
thestagewassel. several of themusicians
showed up. Ihad done my research on
Copeland and the Rhythmatists. but I

was not completely prepared for this
diverse crowd.

WhileIwassoaldnginatlthisin,a
man with ablaek hat slipped behind the
drums, checked things out, and left It
was Stewart.

With the help of Mark Dorr, the
Grinncllpercussion teacher, Iwasziblew
sneakbcekstage Maﬂcintmducodmeto
themanagarandlmentionedthallwanled
todoaninterview withStewartCopeland.
The manager said he would have to ask
Stewartandwouldgetbacktome. Right!
anwhile, Stewart turned the comer
andaskcdme if] knew wheretheshowcr
was. Ipointcd to themen’s balhmm. I
was sturuted.

Now I played this game of bother-
ingthemanagerandntnning intoStewarL
This went on for a while, until I ﬁnally
decidcdtoaskStewan ifhewould liketo
do an interview, he said “Sure, just ask
my manager.“ Well I tried to ask the
manageragain,butl then gotword from
Markthat“therewouldbenointerview."

So I basically spent the whole day
waiting forStewart and nothing panned
out. Well. thatisnotquite true. [did get

to see sound check and witness Stewart

the 708 with the Police, and he said
“Yeah,Grinnell tingsabell." And while

chance to interview to Stewartl did get
