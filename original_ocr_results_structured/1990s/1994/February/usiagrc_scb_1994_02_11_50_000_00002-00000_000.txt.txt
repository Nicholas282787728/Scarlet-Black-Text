HE Israeli»Palesli an peace

talks was the subject of a

week long conference at the

college this past week. Throughout

the week, the college hosted seven

public lectures. outlining issues ran gr

ing from Israeli and Palestinian reac-

tions to the agreemenlloU.S. foreign
policy toward the Middle East.

One of Tuesday‘s lectures was
by Sari Nusseibeh, who until three
years ago was a Professor at Birseit
University in the West Bank. He
spoke about “The Palestinian
Perspective on the Interim
AgreemenL" Nusseibeh began his
talk by complementing the Grinnell
students on how well they were
informed about the situation in the
Middle East He then delivered his
comments about the Declaration of
Principles written and approved in
Oslo on September 13. 1993.

Nusseibeh commented on the
many things made possible through
the declaration, such as the realiza-
tion and acceptance that the conﬂict
is between the Israeli government
and Palestinian people. In addition.
the Israeli government will now we

been set for the future, instead of
thinking about the past. “We can
now see the warm cooperation of
peace — not the cold state of ‘no
war‘," explained Nusscibeh.

Nusseibeh explained that ideals
ofboth the PLO and Israel have been
smashed in the agreement, but this is
a nmessary action. ”Articles of faith
must be swept aside to make room for
agreement." He feels therehave been
positive political steps in the direc-
tion of real and lasting peace, “Each
side needs the other,” he emphasized.

The Rosenﬁeld program began
Monday when David Schoenbaum,
professor at the University of Iowa,
spoke about “What the Israel-Pales-
tinian Dispute is All About.”
Tuesday’s lectures included "The
Peace Process with the Palestinians
& Syria: Israeli Dilemmas” by
Amatzia Baram, a professor at the
Department of Middle East History
at the University of Haifa in addition
to Nusseibeh.

Wednesday continued the pro-
gram with an informal discussion on
economic development in Israel, the
Gaza Strip, and the West Bank; and
Associate Professor of Govemment at
Cornell University Shibley Telharni
with “Negotiating Palestinian-Israeli
Peace: Strategic Imperatives vs. Dor
mestic Politics.“ The schedule was
concluded Thursday with the Schol-

HISTORY from page 1

“I’d like to encourage people to
u-yandmaketimetogotosomeofthe
activities,"continuedFelin.“especially
the symposium and some of the more
academic things we have going on. A
lot of times people will go to the party
and thetalent show, but won’tshow up

for the otherthings. Black folks can do
more than sing and dance, you know."

Owusu agwd, concluding “We
hope that people will join us to celebrate
by attending the lectures. It's a really
good opportunity to learn about black
history, to learn about black culture, to
learn a lot of things about black people.”
