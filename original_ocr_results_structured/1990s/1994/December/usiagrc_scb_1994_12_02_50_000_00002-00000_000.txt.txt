By TIM CORKERY
Copy Editor

TH respect to drinking.
know your llmll and stick
to it, Puking is not fun for

anyone, especially if the puke is on your
nice shoes, or your date’s tux. Also, take
iteasy atyourpreeWaltLpat’ty. You don't
have todrinkyourthree—dollztr’swonl’t in

dance. Do not mosh, or lry to swing
aiound like you‘re in Vienna Combat
waltzing, a la Shcnde & i-iedke, is not
appropriate.

You don’t have to dress up. Big
myth fed to rust-years. Don’t believe it
Be comfortable. A wool tux is nice, but
sirens and a l-shirt won’t give you heat
stroke.

Most importantly, have fun and one

ﬁve minutes.

The waltz is a spirited yet CiVliI7Ed

joy Waltz! It’s not often you’ll get to see
your fneiidslooklng ... nice.
