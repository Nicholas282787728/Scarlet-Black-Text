Grinnellians for Life plan speakers, festivities for
second annual Celebrate Life Week next week

By JonathanCook

XT week, Grinnelliai'is for
Lifewillbeholding iheirsecr
ond Celebrate Life Week, an

opponunity for the group to reach out
to what is undeniably a predominantly
pro-choice campus.

Kari Hallett, a member of
Grinnellians for Life, explained that
the main goal of the week is toeducate
and raise awareness or the pro-life
pcrspoctivealGrinnell College. “Since
Grinnell is a traditionally liberal col-
lege. a lot of Limes the pro-life inovev
montisn’tsoenasviable,”said Hullett.

“It’s seen as uneducated or just
something Lhat belongs to Lhc religious
right,” Halletteontinucd, “One at the
mam goals ol’ thegroup and one ol the
main purposes of CClel’ﬂlCl—IiC Week

”is to say Illtll to be prorlifc is in also
have an intelleclml view."

“I would like ﬁre college to know
that tltere is a fairly simble group on
campus that does support women and
does believe in the right to choose

before conception. There is a prolife
movement here that respects all life."

Catherine Carter, a founding
member of the group. agreed with
Hallett'sexplanation. “I knowthat my
chancesoiconvenlngthiseampusover
to prorlife are slim to none," Carter
said. “But Id at least like to make
people aware that prorlife does not
equal Operation Rescue.“

To accomplish this goal,
Grinnellians for Life will be bringing
two speakers to campus. The ﬁrst
speaker, Fredrika Mathews-Green, is
a nationally recognized ﬁgure in the
pro-life movement. Formerly pro-
choico, she will speak on the relationr
ship between the pro-life perspective
and feminism.

Tari Renaud. another member of
Grinnellians for Life, explained that
this lecture is an important step In the
rec ttion of die legitimacy of the
prob eviewpointbyGrinnellstudents.
“We want to tell the feminist popular
tion here that you can sull be feminist
and that doesn’t necessarily mean
you're not proelife," Renaud said.

The other lecture to be delivered
during Celebrate Life Week willbeby
Greg Chesmore. the national Iield di-
rector for the American Life League
and a member of Iowans for Life. He
will address the roles of men in issues
of pregnancy and parenthood.

Caner, Renaud, and I-Iallett en-
couraged all students to attend these
lectures, even if they do notagree with

the pro-life position. "the speakers
won'tjustbetalkingtopm-lifepwple,"
said Carter. ”They will be addressing
pro-choice people too. There will be
question and answer semions ailer-
wards,"

“We’d like people to attend and
give us a chance." added Renaud. “If
you don’t know the other side. you
can’t defend your own."
