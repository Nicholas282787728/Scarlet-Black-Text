Have you hugged your custodian today? Well, Why not?

In spite of popular myth, students may befriend Grinnell cleaning staff with a clear conscience

HE relationship between stu—
dents and custodians has long
been muddled and unclear.

A familiar rumor around the resi—
dence halls in the past has been that
the cleaning staff is not allowed to
accept gifts from students and is not
even supposed to talk or associate
with them,

But Facilities Management and
Student Affairs have no knowledge
of such a rule. And both staff and
students say that they are getting
along better than ever. despite such
thinking.

“I get along really, really good
with the students,“ said Jo An Bad-
ger, who has worked as a dorm cusr
todian on South Campus for the past
nine of the 22 years she has been
employed by the college. “i really
like every one of the students and i
don't have any problems."

Custodian Karen Groves, while
acknowledging that being a custo-
dian in Younker can be “quite a job,"
says that she doesn’treally have any
complaints about the students ei-
then

“i very seldom have problems,"
she said “The worst part about it is
after a weekend Some of the batti-
rooms can be kind of bad. But most
of the time it's very good,"

Custodian Pat Moore, who just
tretired this summer after 15 years of
cleaning on North Campus, said that
in recent years students have become
more responsible for the messes they
make, which has helped relations
considerably.

“As a rule, we always got along
really well, except for big messes that
were sometimes made." she said,
"Then as the years went along. we
staned reporting big lounge messes
to theR.A.s,and then students started
cleaning up and being more respon-

sible. And that helped relations a
lot."

Students tend to like their custor
dians as well.

“My ﬂoor is mostly made up of
first-years, so I‘m not
sure that they think of
our housekeeper in a
more than domestic way
yet,” said David Axtell,
a Student Adviser this
year in Smith Pit. “I
have had short conver-
sations with Lois (the
custodian in Smith) and
found that she’s a great lady. Iconr
sider her to be a friend of mine.“

ElleettCurley,aSludentAdviser
this year in ﬂames, admits that she
doesn’t know her new housekeeper
very well yet, but said that her former
housekeeper in Smith was “wonder-
ful.”

Custodian Eva Story, who used
to clean dorms about ten years ago
but now works in the
library, remembers
when student-staff
bonding was discour-
aged,

“1 got into a lot of
trouble back then be-
cause they didn’t Want

Through the years, students liv-
ing on Story‘s ﬂoor sometimes gave
her a gift. Story says that the college
never had a problem with it, until
they started getting a “little touchy"
for “no apparent reason.”

Custodian Moore said that cus-
todians receiving gifts never used to

bother the college until recently.

“Years ago. they could give us
gifts and nothing was said," she said.
“But now they say that they need to
sign their name stating that they are
giving us thegift. Idon‘treally know
what started that, but it’s not a big
deal.“

Assistant Dean of Student Afa
fairs OdaCallison says that while she
encourages staff-student bonding. it
sometimes can become problematic.

“It gets into uncomfortable terri»
tory for anyone who is employed to
do a service to the campus when
people start giving them gifts." she
said.

Callison explained that custodi-
ans used to do more for the college
than just clean.

“i recall that in the late ‘605.
they were actually used as spies,"
she said. “They were a reponing
system for me administration here.
but it didn’t last very long and their
role has been pretty much the same
since then."

Today custodians are not re-
quired to report anything they might
see or observe, she said,

The role of the 52 “plantcustodiA
ans," according to Kaloupek, is
strictly to do general cleaning of the
dorms, which includes cleaning
floors, the bathrooms, removing the
Ltash. climbing ladders, and helping
with snow and ice removal,

Kaloupek hopes that relations
between studean and staff will con-
linue to be good. And at the rate they
are going, it sounds like they will be.

“I really like to talk to the stu-
dents," said Badger. “It's always
interesting to see where they come
from and what they like to do.

“On South Campus when we all
get together for our coffee break, 1
don’t hear anything negative being
said about problems with students,“
she said “There isjust not one stu-
dent that I don’t like.”
