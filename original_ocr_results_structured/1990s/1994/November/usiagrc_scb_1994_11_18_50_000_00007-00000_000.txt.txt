endured to be used as a banner for
any cause, especially when used in
such a ﬂippant and selfrrighteous
manner. The repeated whistle blows
and the people lining the walls are
supposed to remind people that a
woman is raped every four minutes,
but what you are accomplishing is to
remind some people of all the tor-
mom that they have been through.
Every night spent crying, feeling
alone and violated comes back in a
single sound. Every four minutes.
Every feeling of anger and guilt, of
pain and despair is thrust upon us.
Every four minutes.

Your demonstration hasn't
woken up the complacent and apo-
thetic, it has tcrrorizcd thc people
you are trying to defend, and driven
them froin the dining halls. There
are those of us who dread this day of
the year, some to the point that they
can't even go to the dining halls to
eat on this day. And, after a polite
message was sent to PAFA regard-
ingthis,tliepersongoibackaconder
seendingresponsc,sayingthatamcal
ofdiscornfortwasnothingcompared
to the stiffening that raped and
abused women go through. Wcll,

from a group of people who have
been there, men and women, we
would like you to know that your
demonstration hurts some of the
people you are trying to protect.
Please do not inflict your self-righ-
teous cause on us in the name ofour
pain Hold your rallies and demon
strations in a place where we can
avoid them. Stay oul ofthc dining
halls.

Naked as a Jaybird

won-y too much. There,
I’ve said it. It’s the truth.

though. We stress way too much
abouteverylhing from classes to how
soon we can get blind drunk at Har~
ris to naked people. Naked people?

Opinion

Read on.

People at Grinncll have been
streaking for years. Because of
Grinncll‘s location and relative sc—
clusion from the rest of the world,
justaboutanythingthestudentswant
todo,theydo. Beingpublicly naked
en massc is one of those things.
Recently, and I won‘t name names,
an intrepid group ofwomen bared it
all in front of a capacity crowd at
Harris, Great fun, right? Not so for
all in attendance, apparently, because
the following Monday, Student Af-
fairs received a rather nasty call from
someone saying how threatened s/
he felt by the nakedness and so on.
Apparently, the Harris Center staff
was then instructed to not let naked
people in. Big whoop, This natu-
rally exploded, via the Grinnell run
mor mill into “new Harris Center
policy" and Grinnell “crackingdown
on nudity” and “charges being
pressed against naked people." Asa
commonly-nakedpersonmysclf,this
disturbed inc. Would I no longer be
able to have my fun? Would I no
longer be able to enjoy my body in
its natural state? Would people no
longer say “Don‘t worry about him,

He’s a swimmer, and then nod
knowingly? It seemed as ifmy Way
oflife was at an end. [had to know
the truth, sol went down to Student
Affairs to chat with Jenny Erickson
and Tom Crady about being naked.

when i brought up the new
policy With them, i was met by
blank stares. “What policy?" asked
Ms. Erickson. “There’s no policy.
If you mean not letting people in,
that's at the discretion of Harris
security." Ms. Erickson then told
me that no complaints have ever
been filed by faculty or staff, only
by students. (Roadrhalagain: “Only
by students”) Continued Ms.
Erickson, ”We actually think it's
pretty funny. They run through thc
Forum, they have fun, we get a good
laugh." Dean Crady cited the per
tenttal “creation of a threatening
cnvtronmcnt” as being the main
source of complaints. He then in-
formed me that, yes, it is against
Iowa statelaw to be totally naked in
public, but, no, no Campus policy
exists to stop it. lowa law, huh? 1
called the police;

“Any person who expose: his
or her genitals to a party that is not

the spouse or performs a sex act in
the presence of a third party" can be
arrested, said the ofﬁcer with Whom
Ispoke. Likewise, any nudity that is
“explicitly offensive to the viewer"
is againstthe law. Does this mean if
aguy has an ugly nose, I can gethim
arrested for not covering it? The
ofﬁcer admitted that the law was
vague, and he said that it was come
monly interpreted rather openly,
“with you college students, cspcr
cially the athletes. No offense or
anything.” None taken.

Which leads me back, in my
own roundabout sort of way, to my
point. Grinnell is the home of 1200-
plus college students who are 507
cially and politically very active,
regardless or what Mother Jones,
whoeversheis, says. They are Opene
minded and try to consider differr
once a challenge rather than a threat.
A naked person is not a threat, even
lfhe is wearing pizza. Being naked
is merelya different way of having
fun. Open your minds. for Pete‘s
sake. is
