German scholar talks of world politics, German unification

An interview with the Dr. Band—Georg Spies, German economist and Marshall F tmd Campus Fellow

By RUPESH PRADHAN

Contributor

R.BemdvGeorg Spies,adis—
D tinguishcd German ccono
mist was on campus last
week asGerman Marshall FundCaln-
pus Fellow. Heis Managing Direc-
tor of Tragergesellschaft Schiffbau
(TGS) in Rostocic in East Germany.
The agency, which is a public-
private partnership, acts as a
consultancy and holding company
for the fourteen employment and
training corporations in the former
east German shipbuilding industry.
Spies is an expert in economic prob-
lemsassociatedwithtthermar-iunir
fication and the integration of Eu-
rope. His Grinnell visit was hosted
by the Roscnfreld Frog-mm in Public
Affairs, International Relations and
Human Rigth.

On the first day of his visit here
last Sunday, I had a two-hour-long
conversation wrth Spies on every-
thing from problems in the north Af»
rican state of Algeria to the Indian
Pakistani dispute over Kashmir to
recentnationalelectionstnGermany.
Here follows a brief summary of his
view points on some current Euro—

pean and German issues:
On this month’s Ger-

man elections:

“The German voting pattern has
changed. The loss of the Christian
Democrats has become the gain for
the Social Democrats and theGreens
in the West and for the reformed
communists in the East. Kohl won
mainly because of his “feel-good”
campaign. The Christian Democrats
basically put aside all the critical is
sues like poverty, xenophobia, un»
employment and castem Europe and
campaignedon the basis oftherecent
economic ﬁgures, suggesting recov-

ery from recession."
0n Helmut Kohl:

“He is a crafty operatorr He prob—
ably will survive a founh tcmi even
though his party has a very slim ma
jority after last week‘s elections.
However, Kohl may dceroy lhc im-
age he has established of himself as
the “Chancellor of German Unifica»
tion." Thereisa term in German that
appropriately describes Kohl. It
roughly translatesinto sedentary peli-
tician: a politician WhOJuSI. sits on the
important problems.”

On Where Germany is
headed:

”There will be more consensus
polities. Since the Social Democrats
are very strong now. especially in the
Upper House, the Bundcsral, where
they have a vetorng majority, the
Christian Democrats Will have to get
their cooperation. Grand coniiuo'n is
what we will see. With theSDP drawn
into cooperation with thegovcmment.
the reformed communists may be the
only real opposition."

011 Germany and the
world:

“Germany’s interest in intema-
tional issues has to go beyond its
desire to be a permanent member of

the United Nations Security Council,
There has been a growing tendency
among westem industrialized counr
tries, including Germany, to reduce
foreign policy to military options.
However, not all international prob»
lems can be solved with the western
alliancc’s ability to rapidly deploy
troops to problem centers around the
world. We have to give more empha-
sis to nonrmilitary foreign policies,"
On European uniﬁca-
tion:

"Europe will be doomed if it

triesto stickby the Maastricht'freaty.
The Treaty simply underestimated
the time needed for the type ofpoliti—
cal union itenvisinnechepening of
Europe has to take a different mean-
ing. Seventeen million Europeans
are unemployed. there seems to be a
rising sense ofnatronalism in Europe
and there are other very serious con-
cerns like eastern Europe and Euro-
pean security The EU needs to focus
or! these issues."

On the Widening of the
EC:

“This too has to take a different
meaning. We nced to Widen it by
creating fairer conditions for eastern
Europe to compare in the ucstem
European market Wecannoltcll cash
em Europe to become competitive

and then,whentheybecomeso,close
our markets from their products
through quotas and tariffs"

On rebuilding eastern

Germany:

“[l'm] much more pessim tir
tltan most people. When thedm ed
Germanyunited,KohlsaidtJittttvidiin
five ycas the East would be on par
\\ ith the West. This time has more or
less elapsed. But eastern industrial
output IS five percent of tht: lotul
nationalinduslrial output and eastern
gross domestic product is onerlznlh
the national gross domestic product.
while eastern Germany has twenty
percent of the total Gcrmun popula
tion. Current estimates are that the
two parts ofthccountr) ii iii notboon
par until 2010, Eastern Germany is

still very much dependent upon the
Sl00billionchcekwcstemGermany
sends to ll every year."

On rebuilding eastern
Europe:

“The rest of eastern Europe
doesn't have the same type of sup
port that eastern Germany has. But
they are certainly making progress.
Russia, on the other hand, is a para-
lyzt‘d state. I have been there every
year since 1990, and thinus seem to
be getting worse day by day, There
has been too much emphasis on
macroeconomicrestructuringandnot
on micro-economic restructuring,

. inundalsoothcrcastemEuro
pcan entrepreneurs are still learning
how to function in a competitive
ccononiy.”
