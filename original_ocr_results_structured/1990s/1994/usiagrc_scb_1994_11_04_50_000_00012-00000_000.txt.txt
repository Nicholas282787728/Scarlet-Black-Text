HE Grinnell College men‘s
soccer learn won its second
consecutive Midwest Con-

ference championship this weekend
The wins improved the Pioneers’
record to 13»3-l overall and l2—0 in
league play.

In the opening game the Pioneers
took on a talented Lake Forest team.
Ten minutes into the game sophomore
Chad Stewart managed to score what
Plilseh termed "a lucky goal."

To the Pioneers’ surprise, lake
Forestchanged its defensive gameplan
during the intermission. “The tactical
changes they made really hurt them,“
commented Pﬁtsch. Facing a less
aggressive attack, the Pioneers had
more chances to score. After Brett
Enger tied the game [or lake Forest at
tlte631d minute, jurliorNeilGoodspeed
put thePioneers ahead for good with a
goal five minutes later. Florin Citu,
Ryan McGary and David Aprahamian
rounded out the scoring for Grinnell.

"They were an excellent team,”
said Pﬁtsch of Lake Forest.

The following day, in a rematch
of last year’s ﬁnal, the Pioneers went
against St Norbert. “This was one of
the toughest games I’ve ever been
involved with," said Pﬁtsch. “It was

the toughest, most physical, quickest
and most well-played on the part of
both teams that I’ve ever seen in the
Midwest Conference."

Less than three minutes into the
contest Goodspeed scored for Grinncll
and theGreen Knights tit‘ditcarlyinthe
second half. In the wand overtime,
according to Pﬁtsch, either team could
havesoored. “Wewerevery lucky logct
theoppomtnily tosmre,”hesaidafterthe
game. Stewart scored the winner on a
pass from Goodspced.

Assessing hisleam’s year, Plitsch
voiocd mild disappointment. Bciorc
the season, the Pioneers had set dual
goalsot’ winning the conference crown
and gaining a bid to the national play-
offs. The second goal was not real-
izcd. The coach also expressed apprer
ciation for his team’s seven seniors
who, he said, will be irreplaceable.
Pl‘usch also had praise for his assistant
coach. Tom McCullen.

Women’s soccer

soccer team saw its season
cometoanearly haltlastSat—
urday with a 3-1 loss toLake Forest
in the opening round of the Midwest
Conference tournament The loss
snapped Grinnell’s streak of four con-
secutive conference championships.
The game got off to an ominous
beginning as the Pioneers fell behind
2-0 after only 10 minutes of play.
After some substitutions, the Pio-
neers picked up their level of play.
Sally Goodspeed led the charge as
she scored Grinnell‘s lone goal.
Despite being down 2-! at inter-
mission, the Pioneers remained con»

mindthatwewcregoingtowin,” said
Coach Marti Kingsleyi “We were in
total control." However, despite tak-
ing 30 shots on goal, the team was
unable to convert any opportunities.

Attempting to explain the cute
come, Kingsley commented on the
often unfair nature of competitive ath-
letics. “The ball justdid not go into the
net. You would think that with 30
Shots, we would be the-Learn with the
three goals, but itJust didn‘t happen."

Despitelheloss,Kingslcy called
the season a success. The tczlrn [in-
ishod with a record of 1174, and the
individual play of several players,
includingscnior MelanieParson,who
broke the Grinnell record for goals
scored in a career, was outstanding.

According to Kinglsey, ror the
team’sseven seniors the challengcwnl
be to place the outcome olthls game in
a larger perspective. '“Ihey can still
boastan exceptional career," Kingsley
said, referring to the 49-12-2 record of
the last four years. “They just have to
realize that the gains of soccer are far
bigger than any trophy,”
