Eighty-two-yearroldClaudc
Ahrcns’ unrestricted $250,000 gill
hroughtthe funds raised {orthc 19937

than doubled last year's total.

“We had no indication lhat we
were going to get it, but it wasn't a
supriscgivcnwhoitcamel'rom.”said
MickeyMunicy,adircclor0llhecam-
paign at the college.

Lyle Roudzlbusl’l. who chaired
lJlisycar'scffonwithhiswicharolyn
said theimportanllhing forhim about
the campaign was "not so much the
dollar amount but the conunilcd shar-
ing of ideas and support between the
town and the college.”

A growing number of retired
people in the area may be increasing
community attendance of college
eventsspecuizitcd Peggy Kolpin,one
of the committee’s vice-chairpcople.

President Pam Ferguson said,
“We’re really proud of the cordial
relationship between the town and the
college. I do believe it’s because the
college makes its events accessible to
the town. There are a number of
retired faculty you see regularly at
events, as well as a cadre of people
who aren’talumni."

This year Lyle and Carolyn
Roudzibush chaired the “pyramid of
volunteers" who personally contacted

about 500 people and businesses.
Excluding Ahrcn’s gift, the average
donation was aboutSlSO. Parlofthc
money goes to the J, B. Grinncll
scholarships, which have been
awarded annually to two studans
from Grinncll High School. This
year’s].B.Grinncllscholnrsarciakc

The rest goes into the annual
fund. Munlcysald,”l‘heannual fund
is what is so imponant because it
provides for the level of excellence
me students and people havccomc to
expect, Endowment also provides
extras, like the fact that conccns and
movies can be provided at no cost.”

This year's vice-chairpeople,
Loren and Peggy Koipln, will prob—
ably begin organizing thc1995cttmr

this year's success.

Still, Ahrcns's large gift had a
