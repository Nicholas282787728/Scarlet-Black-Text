HE Grinnell volleyball team

I had a tough week. posting

only one win in five matches.

Thespikers will take aZrS record into

this weekend‘s Central Invitational
in Pella.

At last weekend‘s Loras Invita-
tional, the Pioneers beat conference
rival Knox in three games, but
dropped their next three matches to
Clarke, Loras and Eeloit. Assistant
coach Evan Erhard said, “We played
well on Friday, against Knox and
Clarke, but we were overmatched on
Saturday (against Loras and Beloit).
The teams weplayed on Saturday are
stmplyahead ofusrightnow." Erhard
said that he was pleasantly surprised
by the defensive play of sophomore
Kelly Louis. who is normally one of
the Pioneer's top offensive players.
The play of senior Tami Geiger was
also praised by the coaching staff.

The Pioneers also lost on
Wednesday against Cornell in five

games. Coach Lori Sadewater said
that while she wasdisappomted with
the loss, “Cornell Is a team that We
lost to every year from 1978 through
1990, but we‘ve split the last four
matches against them. It’s nice to
hold our own againsta team thathad
dominated us. It‘s difficult to take
losing a match that you expecttowin.
butl’mhappyexceptfortheruns that
we allowed."

The individual highlight of the
match came from all-conference
player Liz Nowacki, who set a new
singleematch school record for digs
with 33. Louis and Nowacki led
Grinnell offensively, tallying 15 and
14 kills, respectively.

AllheCenu’leInvitational,Grinr
nell will face Nebraska Wesleyan,
Wartburg and Hamline in pool play.
According to Erhard, ”We're in the
toughest pool. We have a chance at
Wartburg if they‘re down, but the
other two teams are in the top four in
the tournament. We have to learn
from the matches that we don’t have
much ofa chance in."
