WHEAT from page I

Freshman Legislator” by S l. lottt'sian
Magazine. After three terms in the
Missouri legislature, Wheat camr
paigned for a seat in the U.S. House
of Representatives. His victory in
1982 was surprising to many Washr
inglon insiders because Wheat, who
is black, was elected from a district
representing Kansas City and some
of its suburbs—a district that is only
20% black and politically moderate.

During his tenure in the House.
Wheat has achieved many accom-
plishments, Wheat was one of the
youngest Representative ever to be
named to theprestigiousRules Com—
mittee, which is the committee that
determines how abill should proceed
through the House. He is also his
party’s Deputy Whip in the House of
Representatives. In addition, Wheat
is a senior member of the politically
powerful Congressional Black Cau-
cus.

Wheat has been critical of the
press he has received for his Senate
campaign. In Wheat’swords,alotof
articles written about his campaign
can be summed up, “Can a black
Congressman win a Senate election
in a mostly white state?" For ex-
ample, the March 9 edition of the
Wall Street Journal featured an ar-

ticle about Wheat titled, “A black
Senate hopeful, Wheat, tries to build
bridges between race on treacherous
terrain.” Although he realizes that
race still plays a role in U.S. politics,
Wheat explained that he wishes race
“had lost its significance.”

The Senate seat to which Wheat
hopes to be elected belongs to John
C. Danforlh, a Republican who is
retiringwhen his term expires. Wheat
is one of five Democrats seeking the
DemocratjcParty'snomination. The
other candidates are Jackson County
Executive Marsha Murphy, Missouri
stale Representative Steve Carroll,
lawyer Gerald Ortbals, and St. Louis
newspaper can'ier Nicholas Clem-
ent. In thegenemleleetion.theDemo-
cratic candidate will face former
Missouri governor John Ashcroft

“Tumultuous” istheterm Wheat
used to describe his days at Grinnell.
“My Grinnell experience propelled
me into politics and still gives me
momentum.“ Wheat also said that
thc tumultuousnessofGrinnell in the
late 1960’sandearly 1970‘s“created
my political interest." Alan Wheat’s
older brother James Wheat] r. is also
a Grinnell graduate. Moreover, two
Grinnell alumni, Sam Afridi, ‘38 and
Evan Zoeckler, ‘93, work in Wheat‘s
office in Washington, D.C.

image of our bodies. Astaff dietitian

rounding healthy eating. Although

sults, saying “We are just in the
beginning stages of this, and we’re
trying not to push loo much. People
are just starting to feel a connecv
tion."
