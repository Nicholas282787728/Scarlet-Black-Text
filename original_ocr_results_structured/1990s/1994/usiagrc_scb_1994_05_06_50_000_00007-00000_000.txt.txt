Founded in 1986 by Roger
Vetter. theGrinnell Garnelan is based

”on ensembles from the central re-

s gion of Java. Grinnell’s particular

_gamelan, consisting of gongs and
xylophone-likeinstruments ofsteel,

'iron, and wood, was commissioned

sand constructed in the city of

‘Yogyakarta in 1983.

According to Vetter, “Each

gamelan is a unique entity, a set of
instrumean belonging to itself."
Grinnell's gamelan is called Kyahi
Biwara, or‘The Venerable Herald."

There are no stars or soloists in
gamelan, and the music is passed
down not by written composition
but through oral tradition. The emr
phasis is on community and sponta-
neity. According to Nate
Kemperman, a member of the
gamelan for four semesters, it has
exposed him to “a totally different
musical mindset. The idea of
gamelanisinatotally differentplane
titan most Western music."

Aceompanyingthegamelanwill
be the eightrmemberlavanese Dance
Ensemble led by Valerie Mau Vetter.
Rebekah Mosher will perform a
Gale/c solo, which is based upon
Javanese concepts offemininity and
beauty.

The entire ensemble will per-
form Rahwana Gugur (The Death
ofRahwana), the story ofthe ogre
King Rahwana’s kidnapping of a
prince’s wife based on the
Javanese version of the Hindu
epic Ramayana.
