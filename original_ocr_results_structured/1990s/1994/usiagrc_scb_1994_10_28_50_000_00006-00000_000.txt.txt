However,becauserhiseventhas
no precedent at any other institution,
you probably don’thave llte slightest
idea of what it is. Personally, I have
noticed that whenever I mention the
four syllables“BlG Sandwich Night,"
questions and misconceptions sud-
denly start ﬂying.

So in an effort to end the miscon-
ceptions and educate the curious, I
took it upon myself to research and
answer those questions about BIG

heard being asked.

What the hell is BIG Sandwich

Night, like most events, is something
to be experienced rather than de-
scribed. its essence is rattler elo-
quently and concisely captured in the
Ofﬁcial Mission Slatementof the BIG
Sandwich Club, which states “The
purpose of this club is for the creation
andconsumptionofBleandwiches.
which is conducive to conversation,
relaxation and fellowship."

Each Wednesday night, all in-
terested parties trek to I-Iy-Vee in
designated BSN vehicles tobuy sup-
plies, The feast begins upon their
return to Cowles 2nd.

“We're bringing people to-
gether," said founding member Zach
Stevens in response to tttisquestion,
“It's people helping people,“ added
fellow founder Karl Johnson. Zach
then summed it all up by saying,
“It's not about white or wheat, it’s
about bread.”

How the hell did it get started?

Plagiarists dealt stiff penalties

By DANYA LEEBAW
Staff Writer

I AST year, fourteen students
were charged with academic
dishonesty. Of these, nine

were found guilty.

What is academic dishon-
esty? In the Grinnell CollegeStudent
Handbookisasection entitled“Hon-
esty in Academic Wor .” In this
section, the college emphasizes the
need for Grinnell students to “dem-
onsnate a high code of honor in all
their relationships."

of thenine students found guilty
of dishonesty last year, one was put
on academic honesty probation for
two semesters with failure in the
course. Five of the students found
guilty were placed on one semester
of academic probation, and four of
these ﬁve failed the assignment.
Threeofthestudentssimply received
penalties on the assignments.

Two students were found guilty
of cheating on exams and quizzes,
two students of copying homework
from other studean. four of plagia-
rizing, and one student of inventing
empirical data for a lab report. The
above statistics were reported by the
Committee on Academic Standing.
Added to the report is the comment:
“The subcommittee continues to see
casesinvolvingmisunderstartdingby
students about the extent to which
they are allowed to collaborate on
assignments.”

The consequences of academic
dishonesty at Grinnell are severe.
However, many students remain con-
fused by both the definition of aca-
demic dishonesty as well as resulting
consequences.

Most frequently, academic dis-
honesty manifests itseif as plagia-
rism. The college maintains strict
guidelines concerning citations of
material in papers, as well as use of
paraphrasing and ideas. The student

What happens when a student is
accused of academic dishonesty?
Initially, an instructor who suspects
that a student has not followed the
guidelinm of academic honesty as
presented in the handbook and the
tutorial must notify the Committee
on Academic Standing. Once the
work has been turned in to the in-
structor, the student cannot seek fur-
ther negotiation with the instructor.
However, the handbook points out
that “students cannot be penalized
for academic dishonesty without a
hearing by the Subcommittee on
