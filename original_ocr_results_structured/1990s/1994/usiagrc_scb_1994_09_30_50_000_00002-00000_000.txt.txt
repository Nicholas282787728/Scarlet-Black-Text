Enhanced 9 ll service
unavailable on campus

By SCOTT ANDERSON
Staff Writer

The city of Grinnell now has
enhanced 911 service, but Grinnell
College still has only regular 911
service.

911 is an emergency response
service connected directly to the
Grinnell Police Department. It is
used in only in the case of cmergcnr
cies.

To report an emergency students
must dial 9911. They should then
stay on the line to tell the operator
where in the college theemergency is

emote" “3V o\

located becauseunlike enhanced ser-
vice, regular 911 does not automati-
cally give the location of the caller.

The reason that the college does
not have enhanced 911 is that the
college switchboard is too old to
handle it, officials said.

Bill Francis, director of comput-
ing, said the switch board will be
replaced in the next 18 months. The
new switch will have enhanced 911.
Fitch saidamodiﬁercould be bought
for the old switch to make it 911
compatible but since it will be re»
placed soon, it is not worth the money.
