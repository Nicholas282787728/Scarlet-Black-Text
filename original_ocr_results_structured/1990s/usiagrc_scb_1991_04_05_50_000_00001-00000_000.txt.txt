Workshop reveals inadequate assault policies

By Julie Kaster

Approximately 70 students at
tendcdttharch 1 1 and 12“Scxual
Assault Workshop“ run by this
semester's introduction to Gender/
Women‘s Studies class. The pure
pose of the workshop was to raise
awareness about the frequency of
sexual harassment on campus and
to publicize the college procedure
for dealing with such crimes.

The six-student class was con-
vinced that a workshop was ncces~
sary after a discussion in which all
six acknowlcged being assaulted
and/or knowing someone who had
been assaulted in the past. Accord-
ing to sexual assault victim Carla
Parry, “The New Student Day’s
sexual harassment skit did not

clarify the deﬁnition of sexual as-
sault in my mind as I made the
transition from high school to coir
lege."

The students addressed the am-
biguities of the Grievances section
of the Student Handbook which
categorizes and defines different
types of offenses. Particular em»
phasis was placed on the range of
offenses which fall under sexual
harassment,includingunwclcomcd
verbal comments and the creation
of an unsafe environment without
actual physical contact

The reporting of attacks was
stressed as an essential action, re-
gardless of the victim’s intent to
take further steps. Victims may
choose not to ﬁle a complaint, but
having a reportcn file in thc Officc

of Student Affairs is important in
the case of future attacks, said
Steven Jones, Associate Dean of
Student Affairs.

The College-School organiza—

Government President Pedro-
Ferrlandcz McCarthy. According
to Femandez-McCanhy, the com-
mittee has been meeting since last

he had been interested in forming a

Grinncll students had written him
concerning town-gown relations.
Since then. the group has been
planning several events including
the dance. The dance, said
McCarthy, will provide publicity
for future town-gown events. Be»
fore the beginning of the dance.
Fernandez McCarthy will deliver a
speech to the students.

The College-School Youth Re»
lations Committee consists of three
Grinncll College students, two
highschool students, two middle
school students and several admin-
istrators from both Grinnell Col-
lege and the Grinncll»Newburg
School system,

ommendation to the President of

Sexual abuse victims Heather
Hcimbuch andCarlaPat-ryalsodise
cussed the victim’s options of tak-
ing action through both college
channels and legal channels. Rev
porting an incident to the police
ensures that it charges are pressed.
the name of the attacker will be
placed on public record.

According to Jones, Grinnell
College considers sexual assault an
“invasion of privacy" and not a
crimc. Attackers are protected by
the college's conﬁdentiality rule in
accordance with the l974 Student
Right to Privacy Act which states
that student’s cducational records
are confidential and not a matter of
public record. ,

Upon flllng a report, victims are
instructed, in writing, to remain sis
lent about the incident. However,
the unwritten rule requires a ”re-
Sponsiblc Silence," in which the
victim may only discuss the inci-
dent and the procedure with a few
confidantcs; this enables a closed
group of students to be itlfonned in
order to hclp the victim through the
healing process. Deans, Resident
Advisors, and Lhe Mental Health
Center are available for support.

“The rumor mill runs swiftly
through the Gn‘nncll campus. The
college must have time to properly
notify defendants, and it must pro-
tect victims of sexual assault from
further targeting,” said Jonas.

Heimbuch and Party expressed
frustration over the restrictions of
conﬁdentiality. “As a Student Ad-
viser l was unable to perform my
duties, and the floor community
suffered greatly since I was un-
available and had to lie to advisers
and friends. I experienced a lot of
guilt over not being able to warn
other women who showed interest
in the man who abused me,” said
Hcimbuch.

Parry also believes that the
wording of ”dead silence" should
be changed to reﬂect the needs of a
victim to talk to friends andcontinue
the healing process. Both suggested
that the names of sexual offenders
become campus public record.

The students suggested ways to
avoid sexual assault, such as asking
permission before any physical
contact, listening to one's partner,
and relating to partner’s droughts
and feelings. The students are
consideringanothcrworkshoplalcr
in the semester.
