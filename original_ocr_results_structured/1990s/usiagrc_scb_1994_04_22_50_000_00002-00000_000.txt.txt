AVE you ever said that
you can't study just as
well with the radio on—

lhat music doesn’t “bother" you?

Two senior members of the

ByAmandaI-Iombuckle

AST Wednesday. two female
I Grinnell students, one a
sophomore and one a fresh-
man, participated in an illegal, al-
though common Grinnellian Soutlt
Campus pastime; theyjumpedon and
rode the train while it made its way
through South Campus. However.
instead of just going for a joy ride.
these women ended up with a police
warning and an appointment for a
consultation at the police station the
following week.

Issuing the warning to the two
women was Grinnell police officer
Dave Sears who had been stopped at
the train crossing when he saw ﬁve
students taking the joy ride. Sears
was only able to apprehend twoof the
students because the other offenders
were on the opposite side of the train.
He issued them a wanting for crimi-
nal trespassing on railroad property,
and lectured the women about the
safety hazards involved in jumping
trains. When Sears issued the wamr
ing. he radioed a report into the dis»
patcher in Chicago, and the Chicago
Nonhem train investigator heard the
report and called back to the police.
very concerned about the safety of
this practice, androquesdng thatGrin-
nell police meet with the two stu-
dents.

and although two different criminal
charges can be made to students who
jump the train, one a very serious
charge, their main focus is to spread
the word about the danger of riding
trains. “We‘re concerned more with
safety than with criminal matters,"
Birmingham said. “Serious accidents
can occur." Birmingham said that he

Scholar discusses feminist issues at Convo

By KelleyWagers

AST Thursday, April 14, the
I Noun Program, Minority
Scholars in Residence. and
theOfftoeofSpecial Services and Sum-
mer Activities sponsored along awaited
visit from Patricia Hill Collins, leading
black feminist author. At Convocation,
Collins invited the Grinnell audience to
join her for a “locuircchat” concerning
”The Gendered Politics of Racism and
Nan'onalism." Using this informal and
extremely mssible style, Collins pre-
sented discourse from her cuncnt work-
in-txogrees, Fighting Words: Knowl-
edgefowermndthe Challenge a/Bkrck
F emim'st Thought.

Collins centered her talk around
the assertion that social and political
systems of oppression have been
viewed as “discrete and non-overlap—
ping“ issues, however, these ideas are
essentially linked and now it is neces-
sary to “parcel out" the rclauonshrp
between them. She used the polar
examples of middleclass white women
and working class black women to
prove that this link frames women‘s
experience in the United States.

First Collins addressed the role of
reproduction in gender issues. She sugr
gestcd thatall women Confmnltltc issue
of reproduction as pan of their gentler,
though differences exist within various
social structures.

Collins then OHLllllL'Ll three ways in
which this idea of reproduction “gen-
dcrs” nationalist philosophy because a
system of reproduction detcnnirres and
controls women‘s place in the nation.
First. Collins argued, bcx'ause women
are the only ones who can biologically
reproduce a population, they are con-
trolled and used for“the manipulation of
population iornzttionatrsticends.” Collins
used the example of Nazi Germany to
explain how women’s biological ability
to produce children can be used to pro
duce more of ones “own people” and
moreorlossof“otttsiders." The Ameri-
can slogan “haveababy forthenation, ”
she explained. also illustrates this men-
tality. Swondly, women areresponsible
for maintaining the national culture
through theirchildren. Collinsmunté‘d
an anecdote about a cenain little white
boy’s auachmenttoablack,male,“bald-
headed" Cabbage Patch doll to explain
one mother’s refusal to give in to the
duties of American “momism.” Finally,
women are tied to nationalism through
reproduction as symbols of the nation
which must be protected. Mom. in the
dram and heels. holding the apple pie, is
historically “who you go to war for."

But. What would happen if Mom
were black? What would happen to
national identity if the American Ideal
wits not a white. middle class, hetero
sexual nuclcar family? Racism, Collins
argueddscmcntinllylinkcdtoagcndcml
national philosophy and incorporates is-

sues of social class. Which women in
Amcricansocictyareenooumgod tohave
morcchildrcn,whichareconsrdcrcd best
able to pm on national culture, and
which are more symbolic of the United
States as a nation? Collins argued that
within American culture. including
American chutal culture,blttck working
class women areviewedasurtﬁtorunde-
sirable mothers; they are asked, “why
would you want to bring achild into this
world." Producinghcallhy whitebabics,
however. is encouragulandinfertilityof
the white middle class is a “national
disastert" Ifa white motheror family is
a part of a lower economic clam then
adoption is always an answert There-
fore, Collins contended that politics of
racism are inseparable from the politics
of gender, nationalism. and social class.
In her work. Collins ﬁnds that
linking ideas and discovering relation-
ships is essential to resisting social
institutions of oppression. She higha
lights “complimentary differences"
among women’sexpcricnccs. Collins
does not wantto create groups, such as
American white middle class women
and black working class women or
black feminists and whitefcminists, in
opposition. She wants to discover
lnlCr‘SCCliOnS arnon g their experiences
and crctlle unified focus on resistance.

to all kinds ofcuhural stereotypes and
