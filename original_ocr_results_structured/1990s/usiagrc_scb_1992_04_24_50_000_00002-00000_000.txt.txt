tance by the group. The in-groups
here tend to be drawn from those
groups whose causes are supponed
by the PC ideas. This isn‘t what hap-
pens in the outside world. That is
what is meant by status inversion."
said McClelland.

McClelland believes that the re-
sult of this status system, however, is
a campus where everyone is feeling
attacked. Incidents on campus make
politically correct people feel that
more of their work still needs to be
done for their causes to be successful.
Conservatives or non-PC people feel
threatened and that the entire campus
is out to get them. and the people in
the middle just feel attacked from
both sides for being brainwashed ei-
ther by politically correct thinking or
by conservative society.

The report was written by Profes-
sor McClelland and seniors Aras
Vasain's and Guy Potter, with the
assistance of other members of the
research class. It will probably be
made public by the end of next week,
and a public forum to talk about the
report and the issues it discusses will

The new styrophome cup

unstolen ceramic mugs, right

Stealing for

ces Forum

back to styrophome

By Chris Maag

One week before the coffehouse
opened. complete with anew stock of
64 ceramic mugs, students had stolen
enough pen-nanentcups from the Po-
rum to forceDining Services to switch
from permanant plastic and ceramic
cups to styrophome cups.

The Forum began this year with
18-1900 pemanent mugs, both the
plastic take-out and the ceramic vari-

eties. 3700 mugs have been stolen
since the replacement of styrophome

in with ceramic cups in 1990. The
smaller ones originally cost the col-
lege 68 cents, the larger ones cost
around $2.00 making the college's
original investment in permanent
mugs was $4200.

“Switching from pennant-ware to
styrophome is not a long» term solu-
tion. It’s not a rcsponiblc thing to do
to the environment,” said Dave
McConnell, Director of Dining Ser-
vices. "We’re still thinking of what
wecan dotokeep the permanentcups
from being stolen.”

Amoung the possible solutions
might be asking for more substantial
deposits on thecups. Thenew deposit
would be enough to replace a cup if it
is stolen. Another idea has been to

give all new students mugs at new
studentdays,artd encourage allother
students to bring their own mugs to
drink coffee at the Forum. The Din-
ing Services Committee is starting to
make plans for next year to switch
back to pennanant—wear.

“We‘re looking into prices and
colors for cups for new students. We
haven't placed an order yet, but we
will probably do this next yew,” said
Rachael Baar, Director of Student

Activities and New Student Activir
ties.

The switch was originally made
away from styrophome to permanent
ware because of student suggestions
about styrophome‘s adverse affects
on the environment. According to
McConnell, students began stealing
them almost immediately after they
were introduced. Since the switch
was made, McConnell and Dining
Services have not heard from a single
student protesting the change or ask
ing why the switch was made.

The whole program was innitiatcd
and supported by students. I’m really
supriscd by the lack of interest so
quikly,“ said McConnell.

The coffeehouse has been open
sinceApril 9, and solar no cups have
been stolen.
