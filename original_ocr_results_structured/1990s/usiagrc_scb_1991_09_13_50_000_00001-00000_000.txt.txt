By Julie Kaster

Peace Day acltvr (:3 will be held
Saturday in an effort to motivate stu-
dents to work on issues throughout
the school year. In the past, Peace
Day was a spring event scheduled
near finals week.

Pcztcc Day organizer Nora Bloch
said, “The fall is a good time to intro

ducc new issues when studans are n}

still determining their schedules and
classes havcjust begun.”

The Peace Day agenda changes
each year but generally includes work-
shops, talks, and panel discussions.
This year’s activities will address is
sucsofEcofcminism,confliclrcsolu-
lion, environmentalism, oppression.
intemationnl conflict (Israeli-Poles
tinian), and ethnic stereotyping.

Student groups will take a more
active role in Peace Day, a move that
organizers believe will benefit the
entire campus. “Facilitating is an im-
ponantskill tolearnandaltthe groups
have a lot to teach each other about
me issues that we work on.“ stated
one organizer.

towards the environment"

The Multi-Ethnic Coalition will
conduct a workshop on interaction
and cohesion among different ethnic
groups. “Experiential activities and
an informal discussion should pro-
vide a chance for students from dif»
forentethnic backgrounds to begin to
understand and rcspectonc another,”
stated Minnie Alexander, member of
MulLi-Ethnic Coalition,

An Anti-Oppression workshop
will be held in conjunction with the
Women in Leadership Symposium.
Nadia Moritz. director of the Young
Women’s Project based in Washing
ton D.C., will facilitate a workshop
dealing with issues of oppression that
challenge today ‘s peacemakcrs.

Grinnell Alum Chaia Heller will
give a talk on Ecofeminism. Heller
teaches at the lnsLitute for Social
Ecology in Vermont.

The Iowa Peace Institute will fa-
cilitate a Conﬂict Resolution work-
shop offerod twice during Peace Day.

Floating Eagle Feather, an inter-
nationally renowned storyteller, was

‘ scheduled to perform after dinner

Saturday night but has canceled due
to illness.

The closing ceremony is a
Havdallah service, the Jewish
ceremonial ending of Shabbat or
day of nest. The tone of Havdallah is
sad in response to the end of a special
day. According to Chalutzirn mem-
ber Rachel Landsbcrg, “The
Havdallah service is a time to
peacefully reﬂect on the day and to
prepare oneself to go back to the
regular routine and attempt to carry
over the lessons of the day."
