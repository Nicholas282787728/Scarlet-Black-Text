Power, torture and
insanity performed
in student one—acts

By Jennifer Vacehiano

There will be three studentrdir
reeted onevact plays performed April
30 through May 1.

Maria-Louise McCarthy is dircclr
ing "Rituals of Power," a play com-
piled from the text of many authors.
"I wanted to do a multicultural and
gender-oriented play," McCanhy ex-
plained, but since she could not ﬁnd
one that appealed to her, she wrote
her own script using sclecLions by
Maya Angelou (a black poet), Beah
Richards (a black playwright). and
Merle Woo (a chinesc author). to
name a few.

Acting in McCarthy's play are
Allison Birch, Devora Block, Payal
Chitlangia, Geeta Cowlagi, Sam
Lobel, Alice Ostdiek, Brian Peeblcs,
Barbara Southworth, Jennifer
Stokely, and Weixing Sn.

MeCanhy had trouble ﬁnding an
appropreate cast for this play. "I
think that because few productions
here contain roles for people of color,
they rarely have the opportunity to
gain solid acting experience, and con—
sequently do not try out. Some of the
people in my cast have never been in
aplay before. But that doesn't matter
sinceI havesucha smartand talented
groupwhoarewillingtoexperiment,"
she explained.

Because "Rituals of Power" is a

play which envisions a future with
out hierarchy, there are no major or
minor rolest "Each person plays a
different aspect of color and gender,
and each has a monologue. However,
rather than a series of separate im-
ages, the monologues sometimes
seem to speak to each other and are
connected by a common thread: an
attempt to create change by valuing
the ritualness oflife. There is rarely
only one person on slage."

The theme of the play, McCarthy
explained, "focuses on the intersecr
tions of color and gender and sug—
gests that by recognizing-and value
ing--the richness and diversity of
everyone‘s experiences by acknowl-
edging that there is power and beauty
and worth in all aspects of life and
death. we can empower ourselves."

Although not a theatre major.
McCarthy has taken theaue classes
here at Grinnell, and has experience
in both slagemanaging and acting.

Corrie Zoll is directing "The Con-
duct of Life," by the CubanrAmeriA
can feministplaywn'ght,Marialrene
Fomez. Zoll said of Fomez, "i think
that she is one of the most
unappreciated writers in this country.
All of her plays are brilliant, and no
one's ever heard of hert" He chose
"The Conduct of Life" because it is
"short, but good."

This particular play is set in an

unnamed Latin American country.
An Army lieutenant is promoted, but
in his new position he must tenure
people.

"The play shows how a backdrop
of torture infects every level of soci-
ety," Zoll explained. Suzan Somtag,
wholivedwidiFomazformany years,
wrote about "The Conduct of Life."
"Itexplores the psychology of tortur-
ers."
The actors in this play are Rob
Killen, Ruth Chiles, Maria
Hatzisavva, Toni Sirgusa, and S.
Michael Smith. Zoll explained that
he had only two weeks to put the play
together. which “forced us to work
well togetherwwork close together to
get things done. It created a produc»
tive environment."

Zoll is a graduating theatre major.
Aside from "The Conduct of Life,"
Zoll has directed "Cloud 9" by Caryl
Churchillandlastsummcrhedirectcd
"The Maids," by Jean Genet Willi Lhe
Province Town Theatre Company in

Massachusetts. Lastspring Zoll was
off campus studying and directing at
theNational’IheaLrelnstitutein Con-
necticut. As well as directing, Zoll
has performed in many plays.

"’Dentity Crisis," a black Comedy
by Christopher Durang. is being di»
rected byJennifer Mattem. Theplay,
Mattern explains, is "completely
nuts." Centering around a"basketcase
family," with an insane mother, a
father with four personalities, and a
child who eventually loses it. the
theme is definitely insanity.

When asked Why she chose to di-
rect this particular play, Mattem ex
plained that it was "one of the few
plays that when I read it it made me
laugh outloud." She had wanted to do
something that was fun rather than
serious.

Acting in Mattem's play are Erin
Lynch, Barry Gilbert,JenniferKulik.
Kurt Dorschel, and Elisa Erali. "I
can't stress enough what a good cast
they are," Mattem said.

Directing people to act insane is
somewhatofachallengeforMattem.
On stage people either tend to go
overboard or freeze up, so, she ex7
plained, "We‘retrying [0 ﬁnd a happy
medium of insanity."

”Of course," Mattcm pointed out,
"the east is fairly insane." So that
makes it easier.

Manem is a graduating art major,
but she has been very involved in
theatre during her years at Grinnell.
She has acted in “Uncommon
Women," Dracula," "The Visit," and
"The Temptest," to name a few.

"'Denlily Crisis" is Mattem's ﬁrst
directing experience. "I‘ve always
been given directions, but I‘ve never
been on the otherend." shcexplained.

Mattem plans to teach English
overseas for a whilcafter graduating,
but plans toeventually go to graduate
school for theatre. “So I can earn no
money," she said.

The plays will be performed at
8:00 p.m. in Flanagen ArenaTheach.
