A Whole

new approach to basketball

Designed for the players, the fans, and town relations

SCOTT ANDERSON
STAFF WRITER

UnderCoach David Arseneault,
the Grinnell Pioneers men's basket-
ball team has been undergoing a ver—
itable revolution in the way basket—
ball is played. Now the team has “a
fanatical, up—rempo game," accord—
ing to Arseneault,

Four years ago the team was
floundering, attendance was low, and
the team was being dominated by
bigger, stronger reams. Arseneault
talked to the players and decided to
make a change. “What we're doing is
breaking new ground. out confer—
ence is so conservative and tradi—
tional," explained Arseneault.

The team is based on a rotating
system of three five«man squads that
are constantly rotated in and out,
One squad will play for two minutes
and then the next squad comes onto
the floor. Ed Brands ‘96 says he
enjoys the system because “I canplay
as hard as I want. I don’t have to pace
myself, unlike on other tearrn.” Ar—
seneault said that of the eighteen
team members. at least fifteen will
play a significant pottioneverygame,
a participation level unheard of in

college basketball “I decided that if L

kids at Grinnell are gonna put in that
much time they have a right to play."

Squads are essentially built
around roles—a shooter, a ballham
dler. and a tebounder. Influenced by
theEuropeanernphasisonthreepoint
shots. the team's entire strategy is
now to get one of their three point
shooters open to take a shot. Last
year. the team averaged 42 three
point shot attempts and made 18.5 a
game, an NCAA record. Blessed
with excellent shooters like anih
and Steve Diekmanri ’95, the team
attempted to use them to their best
advantage

The game is also tepr lively by.

the team s approachtowatds defense:

constantly attempting to steal’the
ball. According to Brands, “we're
taught to gamble, to take chances.”
He estimated the team will probably
have a successful steal one out of
every three times, and the opposing
team will getagoodshot one ofrhtee
times. With this defensive style,
play is kept lively: every 21 seconds,
on average. Grimell regains possesr
sion of the ball.

While players are coached dure
ing practice. during the game’they
have a great degree of freedom to
make thingshappen themselves This
is perhaps the toughest adjustment

Using this intensenew approach
that emphasizes so many unusual as—
pects of the game has been effective.
For the past two years. the team has
led all NCAA divisions in scoring
and the team’s confidence has great—
ly increased “In my mind and the
players, each of them is first string,"
Atseneault explained

Fan support has grown tremen-
dously during recentyeats, bothfrom
the college and the town Arsene-
ault calls the crowd envir
Darby, “a wonderful pla
tonmettr, the guys really enjoy play—
ing, showcasing for the fans,

tinue to grow since “people like to
watchsomethingthat’scompen ve,”

between the college and town o
have so many townspeople attend

the games, especially the numem

teen-agers who are in art

Many players are everireeeiv

ault expects to attract even more
people from the town to the games,
since both the new assistant coach,
Dave Van Atkel, and top recruit this
yearJefiClement’99, are mGr‘tn-

record. Orinnell put forth a
Valiant effort against the Mid.
west Conference—leading Cot-
nell Rams last weekend in :i
hard<fought 32—17 loss. The
Pioneers compiled over 300
yards in total offense and held
the daunting Rani offense well
under its average. “Overall,
we played fairly well against
Cornell," said Coach Greg Wal-
lace, “We were disappointed
With the way we played in the
third quarter, but we certain<
ly played tight with them the
rest of the way."

Cornell struck first with a {ﬁsh
quarter touchdown and two—point

conversion to take an early 80 lead.
But the Pioneers then drove the
length of the field to set up a 20—yard
field goal by freshman Stan Banks.
Cornell answered with afield goal of
their own to make the score 11—3 at
halftime. The third quarter proved
to be disastrous for Grinnell. The
Rams' Andy Ehresman retiinied the
opening kickoffso yards for a touch—
down. The offense turned the ball
over four times in the quarter which
led to two more scores by Cornell to
give them a comfortable 3L3 lead.
But in the fourth quarter the Pio<
neets started a tally of their own.
JuniorfullbackEticRienschecapped
off a 65—yard drive with a 17.yard
touchdown run with 10:06 remain-
ing in the game. Later freshman
quarterback Josh Magden found re—
ceiver Kafele Hodari in the end zone
for a 22—yard scoring strike, With

alletime leader in receptions. But it
was too little, too late for the Pio—
neers,

Although disappointed with the

loss,CoachWallacewaspleasedwith
several aspects of his team's perfor—

mance. “Defensively, our front line
did a great job of slowing down their
runninggame,"commentedWallace
Senior nose guard Chris Bait record
ed six tackles and was named defen—
sive MVP. Junior lineman Paul Nel—
son finished with nine tackles in—
cluding a sack and a forced fumble.

Wallace also praised the effort
of freshman \vlnngICk Richard We—

another step forward this Saturday

ford to let Monmouth's option of—
fense to break loose against us.” said
Wallace. “Hopefully the improve—
