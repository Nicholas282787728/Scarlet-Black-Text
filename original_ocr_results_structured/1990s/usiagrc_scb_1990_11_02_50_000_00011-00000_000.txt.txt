Hamlet Rehearsals Ready Cast for Fall Production

By Chris Doemel

As its ﬁrst major production of
the 199091 year, the Grinnell
College Theater Department will
present Hamlet. Directed by Ellen
Mease, Hamlet will be performed
in Roberts TheaterNov. 15-17 at. 8
pm.

Auditions forlheplay look place
last September. After the casting.
the actual rehearsals began.

Since then, the actors have been
concentrating on the memorization
oflines. and defining their charac-
ters' relationships with other char
acters on stage.

“This is where real acting be-
gins,” said Mease.

According to the director. the
actors practice “eye contact, readr
mg the mood and temper of their
scene partners, and makin g the ac4
tions,evcnts. ideasand emotions of
each scene come alive as if for thc
fﬂslum67lmtld0 thatcontinually."

As the performance date creeps
closer, the actors gctmorc and more
involved with their characters.

“It gets more complex nightaf—
ter night, as they go through suc-
ccssively richer. moreexpericntially
alive scencworlt.” said Mease.
“Their interactions become much
more complex and interesting for
us to watch,"

The cast consists of 25 players.
ConicZoll will play Hamlet. Zoll,

a junior, has performed in the col-
lege productions of Three Sisters,
Endgame and Dracula.

“It‘sarole thateveryactorwants
to play,“ said Zoll. “I'm very lucky
to have the opportunity to do has an
undergraduate. If I pursue a career
in theater. it is likely that it will be
many years before i will be given
this opportunity again. Part of the
challenge of the role is that it is a
very long play. There's a lot to
know. and l-lamletis a lotof different
thingsduring thecourseofthe play.
There's a lot of contrast in between
the different scenes. and a lot of
contrast in the character."

“I have described [Corrie 201]]
as the ideal actor." said Mcase. “I
can't think of any better person in
the 20yearsthatl’vel7een directing
to tackle this role. He's such an
exemplary instance of the young
actor who intends fully to enter a
professional career, and he is very
serious about what he does. And he
haslhejustil'iedselfconfidencethat
goes with prerprofessional inten-
tions.“

“To play the role of Hamlet."
Mease continued, “you've got to
have the appearance of possessing
the entire array of skills that a tor
naissance humanist prince was ex7
peeled to have cultivated through
out his 25 years of training tn
princchood. Corrie must learn these
things in two months."

All of lhc members of the cast
are preparing for and contributing
to the production in a variety of
ways.

starter; she’s already a trained
dancer,andmovesbeautifully,”said
Mease. “She brought in original
inventions for the songs in the mad
scenes. and she brings so much to
rehearsal, it's kind of a joy for a
director to work with her because
she gives you an array of moods to
workwith,sothatldon‘thavetodo
a lot of inventing for her."

“[2011] and Jeremy Hawkinson
(Lacrtes) will begin to ehoreogmph
their duel in the fifth act." said
Mease, The two actors spend half
an hour a day in training with
Stephen Emmanuel and Johanna
Meehari to eventually produce a
realistic duelinthebloody fifth act.

The timc commitment that is
required for the actors is enormous
Zoll spends approximately six and
a halfhours aday in preparation for
the performance.

“I‘ll be spending an hour and a
half to two hours a day with the
director outside of rehearsal work-
ing on the character and on the
lines,” said 2011. “l’l‘rspeud a half
an hour a day fencrng, and about
l‘ourhours a day rehearsmg with the
restoi’thc cast. It is the majority of
whatl’mdoingihts semester.”

The stage managers, Bridget
Wilcox and Marla-Louise
McCarthy, as well as the three
assistants to the director, Ed
Durﬂlrtgcr,Dt|vid Preston and Susi

Steggcrda. are also invaluable to
the director. Together they attend
rchearsalstoprompttheactorsnake
notes and take care of tasks that
would otherwise occupy the
director's time. In addition, the
stagemanagers also act liasons bcr
tween the cast and crew.
Designer Jim Taylor is in
charge of the costumes and set de»
sign fortthamletproduction.The
costuming for the play will be in
20th-century formal dress.

“By putting the play in a formal
atmosphere, the violence that hapr
pens at the end of the play is uncx»
pccted." said Taylor.

Another function the costumes
will serve is to establish
rclationshipsCindy Abel, the as-
sistant costume designer, will be
constructingcostumcs in thecollcgc
costume shop.Thc construction of
the stage Will be tlonc by Dawn
Roskc, the assistant technical di-
rector. Shewtllbeassisted by about
15 students, including the stutlans
tn the slagccraft class and those
earning pcrlormane lab credit.

“The palette of the production
is hastcally black and white and
shadcsoi'grny," Stilt] Tuyi — 'By
establishing c tnin characters. or
groups of characters. in black or
while, we are then clcmly able to
establish relationships."

“The. set is hasrcally. renais-

Sarice architecture," saidTaylor. “ll
will be painted in a non-chromatic
stone. It's basically columns and
arches."

The production is sparse in
terms oflighting.

"Thereis notalotofcolor,“sziid
Taylor. ”The play takes place in
Denmark; it‘s sort of a cold atmo
sphere.“

The original music for the pro
duction will be composed for the
Grinnell Theater Department by
former Grinnell student Kevin
Zocmig. Zoemig, who graduated
from Grinnell in 1980, has been
activeasbothaperformerandcomr
poscr. Zocrnig has previously
composed production scores.

Since suitable music was diffi-
cult to find. the production direcs
tors decided to ask Zoernig to
composcsomething speciﬁc forthe
Show.

"The suite itself would serve as
a prershow overture,“ said Mcase.
”We are particularly looking for
the kind of rhythmic and percusr
sive scoring that helps to shift the
mood from scene to scene.”

“Music really ltclps to establish
transitions in mood," Mouse cone
tinned, “And there's such variety
andcoinplexity in themoods ol‘thc
play,lminkthatnotonlytheaeting,
butamusicalaccompanimenthclps
to chart an audience through that

variety of moods."

One problem that Mease and
Taylor have been forced to con—
front and compromise is Roberts
Theateritself. According to Mease,
the theater was originally designed
in the sixties by a theaterconsultant
named James Miller.

“We don‘t have a theater that. is
ﬂexible enough to serve the full
array of instructional purposes in a
theater design." said Mcasc. ”Der
signers at Grinnell have to spend
most of their time compensating
for the defects of the space rather
than experimenting With a variety
of scenic styles that the history of
theater design has gtvcn us to work
with."

“There’s not really enough
depth," sulrl Taylor, “lfyou look a:

the standard |S that you MC twtcc as
Wide as you are high. Roberts is

it is wtde, It’s like looking into a
shoebox7 that’s not a very pleas-
antproportionalrclauonshiptolook
at. it‘s hard to concentrate on one
thing in the center.“

As an example of the problems
that the Hamlet production team
faces, Mease cited acoustics.

”Sound gets caught and revcrr
beralcs in incredibly unpredictable
ways in Roberts. leavmg numerous
large deud spots where you can’t
hearawordon stage. Shakespeare‘s

language is so incredibly complex,
lllat it they miss an article or a

crucial adjective, they are going to
miss the syntax of the whole sen-
tenceimaybc even the whole
speech.“ said Moose.

“Young actors who in particular
need to pay attention to the values
of building a character, interaction
with a scene partner. truth to emo-
tional realityithosc very small
nuanced things that we wantyoung
actors to experience f irst—have to
throw all that away because they
are so busy trying to projectin order
to be heard in the back row. 50 you
lose whatever nuance you might be
able to develop in acharacterization
or a scene interaction. and I think
that's a crime against young actors
to make them constantly do what
they should not be doing first:
worrying about projection and
compensating for bad performance
space.“

“Every good actor wants to play
Hamlet,and everydirectorwantsto
try particularly Hamlet," said
Mease. “Hamlet is. of the major
problem plays and tragedies. the
one that is most accessible for un-
dergraduate actors."

And with the cast and crew that
Mcasc has to work with for
Grinnell’s production of Hamlet,
Mcasc has no qualms about that
upcoming Nov. 15 opening night.
“We’ve been working three hoursa
night. but there's been such pttr
tience and devotion to this play,
there is nothing thalindicates tome

to the end With full clarity and cor
hesivcness."
