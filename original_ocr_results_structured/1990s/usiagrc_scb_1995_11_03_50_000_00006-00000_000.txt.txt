the Million Man March. The opinions

he and a half million

strong we stood. A

sea of Black faces, of
all different shades, as far as
the eye could see. "Long live
the spirit of the Million Man
March!" was the chant that
rang out through the skies of
the nation’s capitol that day.
All around the white House -
different faces, different
styles, different perspectives -
so many people. Put simply,
on Monday. October ‘IS, 1595,
Washington, Dc saw the
strength of the one and a half
million proud and strong Black
men - united!

The sky was a clear baby
blue - cloudless, limitless. Ex-
citement, anxiety and love all
permeated the air on that
spectacular day. Even with
the mass of media inter-
spersed in the crowd, no one
truly had the need nor urge to
summarize this moment. I
thought to myself, "it's one of
those moments you want to
take in and talk about later,"
as I stood in the midst of all
these Black men surrounded
by feelings of amazement,
care, and, most importantly,
unity!

Although over one million
Black men from all different
walks of life came together
during this march, there was
an overwhelming sense that
at least these one million

cared - not only for them-
selves, but for one another.
Malcolm x once said, "I be-
lieve in anything that is nec-
essary to correct unjust con-
ditions I believe in it as
long as it's intelligently di-
rected and designed to get
results." The fact was not
that this march of one mil-
lion men was necessary, but
that these one million Black
men believed and under-
stood that something of this
caliber was necessary - not
simply for those present at
the march, but for the entire
Black community.

There was also an effort
made to encourage eligible
persons to register to vote, if
they were not already regis-
tered. Regardless of what
most non-participants ex-
pected, it was a peaceful
march, with peaceful goals
and obiectives.

The Million Man March
served as a holy day of atone-
ment, reconciliation, and re-
sponsibility. It was a day for
Black men, regardless of their
religion, age, political affilia-
tion, or educational back-
ground, to atone for their sins
against each other, their fami-
lies, and themselves.

gamut of ref us, philo-
sophical, poll cal and secu-
lar viewpoints. Members
from rival gangs in Los An-
geles used this day to atone
and reconcile their differ-
ences. young boys and girls
ascended the platform to
showcase their gifts and
talents and to encourage
Black men and women to
reclaim their lives, rebuild
their communities, and re-
constitute their families by
taking responsibility for
their actions. The Grammy
award-winning singer and
songwriter Stevie Wonder
shared a song from his Iat-
est album, entitled "All For
one."
