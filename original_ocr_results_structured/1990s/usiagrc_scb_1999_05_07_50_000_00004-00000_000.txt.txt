BY ARIN HILL

I have several ouesrions rhnr maybe yoli all can help me answer.

1) Why do some studenrs assume that rheir homework nssignmenrs me
more imporrarir rhan yours?

Case in poinr: Earlier rhis semcsrcr, l was sranding ourside orrhe Spanish
lab. I was wairing to go over my Spanish assignmcnr, when rhis girl from my
firsr semesrerspanish class came over ro me and asked me how long 1 would
be in the lab, I rold her less than rliirry minutes, Then, she Iifrcd up her
paper. poinred, and said, rhis is all [ have (indicaring a paragraph or rwo) and
asked me ifshe could go ahead of me. I looked at her real hard and then
rhoughr ro myself (rhis girl could nor be serious) because, rliis is rhe same
person who barely says hello ro me when l say hello to her in passing, 1 rold
her rhat I had arranged [0 meet with the assisrant (otherwise known as an
appolnlmcnr) and rhar I needed ro finish my nssignmenr ﬁrsr. She was nor
roo happy, Bur oh well. Life is a '&@‘,'!

2) Why is ir rhrr some srudenrs wanr ro be up in your (academic) busi-
ness? .

Case in point: lusr rhis week, 1 walked inro my philosophy class and rhis
girl asked me wlicrlier or nor 1 had rurned in my Kanr paper in yet. 1 locked
ar her, said no, rhar 1 was srill working on ir. obviously rhis girl “knew
everyrhing" because rhen, she said, very asserrively rhar rhe reacher would
not hand back the orherstudcnt’s assignmcnrs until I turned mine in. I looked
ar her and was lirerallysrupefied by her remark. 1 rold her rhar this parricular
reacher would nor keep our papers iusr because one srudcnr had nor rurncd
his or hers in. However, she insisted on trying to tell me different. So, I told
her rhe reacher said rhar she was going ro read rhe papers on rhe plane rhe
nekr morning anyway. Thar shur her up real quick. Especially, when orher
srudcnrs in rhe class murmured in agreemenr wirh me, some people need ro
mind rheir own business. Know what I mean?

5) Why is mar in several of my classes, we always ralk abour rhc Holo-
eausr, bur we never ralk abour slavery2

case in point: This even goes way back ro high school. . . In all ofrhc
classes 1 have ever raken rhroughour my educauonal career, wirh rhe excep»
rion ofCrirical Race Theory (rhisscmesrcr), we always ralk abour rhe negar
rive consequences ofrhe Holocausr and how rhis mayor hisrorical evcnr srill
affects us today, bur we never ever talk about slavery and racism in America
and how rhar arrecrs us roday, 1rwe do ralk abour slavery, ir is only for one
class period or ar rhe end of class for fifreen minures. learning abour rhc

l-lolocausr is vcry imporrnnr, our only in addlrion in learning nboul orlier
slgnlﬂcanr hisroricnl evenrs. People need ro srop rlus inrellccrual, social and
culruml denial abour slavery. Slavery did occur in this counrry and, sense»
qucnrly, lirernlly dcvasrarcd many peoples lives in rhe pasr and srill connnucs
ro do so roday. ofcourse, 1 could rake courses rheir specifically address the
issues nfslrveiyand rnce, burwhy can'r all class plans be modiﬁed so rhey are
more comprehensive and inclusive, insread orerclusive, Thar is whar I pay
ruirion for and why I came ro college. Why did one ofmy reachers srare rhar
rlie social srrarincarion of rhe Jews and when by rhe Nazis was rhe worsr
social srrrrihcarion sysrem ever created? Whar abour rhe social srrarificarion
in America which still plagues rhis coiinrry roday? Or does rhar nor count?
And a few weeks before rhur when i asked her ifrace could be considered as
a social insrirurion, she said ir was nor?!

4) Why is rhar people have Io renr up rurnirrirc in rhe dorms when rhey
aredrunk? (i.e,, soap dispensers, doors, rabies. wrireonwalls etc.) The people
ar Facilirics Managemenr have ro repnir rhcse rhings and rhe cusrodlans have
ro clean up rhese big messes. if you were rhem, you would wanr a link
respecr 1 am sure?! People should be rhankful rhar rhcy have rhe opporruniry
ro arrend rhis college. 1 am sure rhar rhere are a rew reenagers in Cabrini
Green in Chicago who would love ro rake your spor. So basically wliar I .im
saying is, chill rhe me: our!

Case in point: You all know who you are
names orpeople or dorms,

5) Why is rhar my roommare always has ro give me srrange looks when»
ever 1 walk inro rhe room? -

case in palm: Tonighr, (I like my roommare. burl am nor so sure ifshe
likes me?)

These are rhings rhar make you go hmmm. . ,

lam having a grear rimc herear Grinnell college and I rhank my parenrs
every day for sending me here, bur somerimes I wonder . . . . i know rharl
am srill learning and growing bur somcrhing seems a bir wrong ro me. Docsn’r
someihing seem wrong ro you? i am nor birrer, selfish, arroganr, nor do i
have an arrirude, bur 1 am eonrinually amazed how cerrain people on rhis
campus frequenrly have lirrle regard for orher members ofrhe Grinnell com.
muniry. I rhoughr we were all marure adulrs. can someone please explain
rhis phenomenon ro me, because i iusr do our undersrand, no marrer how
hard 1 Iryl? Am i rhe only one who feels this way?

Lei’rers lo

Dear Andrew and all NATO-loving inrervenrionisrs,
twanr ro believe rhar rhere are srill people in this counrry, and on
rhis campus in parricular, who have open eyes and open hearrs. Burl
know for sure rhey are nor many. 1 am very sad and disappoinred by
rhe receprion of my column from lasr week's Scarlet d‘Blatk. All I
wanred was ro ger people ro rhink erirically abour whars going on in
Serbia, and rhis modesr mission seems ro have failed urrcrly, l rc-
ccived few responses: rwo lessons in American hisrory, a column by
Mr Civcrrini urging me to seek clarificarions from a hisrory major
(l), a lerrcr ro rhe ediror wish a clear anri-Serbian agenda, and one
anonymous e.mail rhrear (ralk abour hare.free crinnellz),
ofcourse, ardenr American parriors hasrened ro poinr our falla»
cies in my analogy berween Kosovo and rhe American Civil War. 1
never claimed 1 was an experr on American hisrory (just as mosr
Americans are nor experts in Serbian history), bur 1 wonder if per»
haps some ofyou skipped school when your hisrory class was doing
Sherman’s brural “March on she Sea", or maybe your tcxrbook failed
to menrion it? Yes, General William Tecumseh Sherman, rhe cel.
ebrared hero ofrhe Norrh, also known as rhe farher ofmodern “total
war", cur a wide swarh (no smaller rhan rhe area oFSerbIa’s sourhcrn
province), his army laying wasre and burning down everyrhing rhar
was in rheir way - in his own words: “war wirh every man, woman
and child in rhe South". No wonder rhis ravage ofrhe sourhem coun—
rryside creared generarions of birrerness among ehe residenrs of me
srares Sherman’s army passed rhrough. Personal quote from rhe gentler
man: “War is hell.” Indeed, I cannor bur agree. And unlike Mr
Civetrini, 1 don’t need ro look up definirions ofwar in books ro know
rhis. 1 rhink in rhis respecr he is surely more confused rhan I am. 1
was rwelve when my rown was shelled by croarians, and you know,
dieir bombs aren’t quite as smarr as NATos, so rhey hit a kindergarden
and a house in my srreer less rhan 50m away, among orher rhings.
This is one of rhe clearesr memories 1 have from my childhood: ir
was in rhe middle of my arr class and we were drawing still narure,
and rhen all ofa sudden, we heard several loud explosions, bur no-
body knew Whar was going on, rhere was grear confusion and panic.
and since rhe school has no basemenr, all of us (abour 2,000 kids)
jusr srood in rhc middle ofour huge communist-style reciraricn hall,
some crying, some screaming, some praying. There was bombing a
few more rimes, usually in rhe middle ofrhe nighr, so rhe school was
our for a few monrhs. Or: my relarives who live on rhe orhcr side of
rhe border, in Croana, and are just simple pcasanrs who foughr ro
defend rheir homes (rhey losr rhe war and everyrhing rhey owned:
now rhey live in Serbia as refugees), yer rhey are on rhe list orwar
criminals in Hague, And rhere are many similar stories I could've
- cold, orrhings I’ve seen and lived rhrough, and nor iiisr read in New
York Times or seen on Tv — ifyou mred ro ask. so why am I relling
you all rhis now? Not because I bear a grudge (I don't, srrangcly), i
simply wanr ro rell you rhar in war, rhere, is much suffering on all
sides, and viewing rhings in black and whire, while ir mighr make
rhings easier ro grasp, complercly escapes rhe realiry of rhc siruarion,
and as rhc currenr bombings show, can have rragic consequences. if
you supporr rhe milirary acrions ofNATo, and believe us worrh rhe
price (payed by people of Serbia, nor yourselfll, rhen you are really
no berrer rhan rhe war hawks rhar rule Serbia, Everybody I know in
Serbia, who has access ro non—governmenr informarion and knows
abour rhe arrociries rhar are raking place in Kosuvo, is condeming ir.
So why is ir so hard for “pcacenlks” here ro condemn rhe equally
arrocious acrions ofrhcir governmenr and srand decisively for peace,
like rheir parenrs did rhree decades ago? Perhaps it makes you feel
good ro bc righreous when you're only pushing burrons, ifrhar much,
when you go abour your regular lifc, blissfully unaware rhar every
day, someone innocenr in Serbia (or Iraq or elsewhere) is killed as a
resulr of your country’s “righrcousncss”? For my family and rriends
back home, iris nor iusr a question ofmoral, ir is one ofsurvival, and
life is roo high a price for anybody, regardless of rhcir erhniciry, ro
pay for shorrcomings orPrcsidenr Milosevic (whom rhey didn'r elecr
lawfully) or for failures orwesrern diplomars (who have even less ro
do wirh us). Larely, rhe phone connecrion has been parchy, and rhen
I wonder lfI’ll ever see or ralk ro my sisrer again , and can you imag»
inc going rhrough (bar? 1 know ir is very easy for Americans ro rorger
whar war is really like, and re be idealistic abour many rhings, bur
where 1 come from, rhere hasn't been one generarion rhar has lived
rheir lives in peace and freedom, in all ofour hisrory. My grandrarhcr

(who was a peasanr) afrer barely escaping Ustashas' murderous ram-
page rhrough our rown (he was saved by a good croarian friend of
his), joined rhe parrisans and foughr wirh rhcm unril rhe end of rhe
war, for which rhc communisrs rhanked him by raking away mosr of
our land. My orher grandfarhcr spenr mosr ofrhe war in a conccnrra-
rion camp in Germany, My greargrandfarhers foughr in rhe
Thessaloniki From in Greece during World War 1, and in rhe 0crober
Revolution in Russia. And so on.

But Andrew, rhe earnesr Grinncll srudenr rhar he is, wenr and did
some research and he found our rhar in a civilized war, “soldiers do nor
kill civilians"! All righr, rhen, give me one example rhar firs inro rhar
definirion (and “Saving Privare Ryan" docsn’r counri) B is ir Vicrnam
(remember rhe massacre ar Mylai?), or NATO’s currcnr bombing of
Yugoslavia (over 500 civilian vicrirns in a month) . or maybe you’d
prefer ro call rhese jusr. “police acrlons"2 or which of rhc civil wars in
EasrTimor, Sudan, Kurdistan, Rwanda,Tiber, Checnya, Norrhern Irer
land... would sarisfy your criteria?’

And anorhcr rhing, Andrew: 1 can'r srand Red jeler. 1 rhink per»
haps rhc real source orour misundersrandings is deeper rhen we think:
ir’s whars in our blood Unlike you, Andrew, I grew up nor on Red
iciho, bur caring plums srraighr from rrees in our big garden.

Dear Editor,

We are wriring in regards ro rhe recenr denial ofrenurc oirhe Chi-
nese Deparrmenr Chair, Y.K. Lo. We, rhc undersigned, find ir In»
credulous rhar a reacher as good as Mr. Lo has been denied renure.

Even under normal circumsrances, Mr. Los denial ofrenurc would
be a grave misrake. The facr rhar he was denied renure on rhe grounds
ofsupposed reaching inefreerivcness, however, places rhis sad incidcnr
firmly in rhe rravescy of justice caregory. Unforrunarely, rhere are
some very ineffeerive renured reachers ar Grinnell, enough ro make
one wonder how much reaching abiliry really facrors inro renurc con.
siderarions. And now we have a case ofan exemplary educaror, who
also has performed good scholarship and has been cXIremely inﬂucn-
rial irnor rhe driving force behind growrh in his deparrmenr, and he
ism

good enough? We rindersrand rhar even among rhe faculry rherc
are a number ofrhem rhar find his review process problemarie Sums»
rhing is rorrcn in rlie counry ofPoweshiek.

Ar besr, Grinncll College can be characrcrized as a qualnl our-of-
Ihcsway liberal arrs school rhar happens ro be one ofrhc bcsr Institu-
rions in rhe counrry. Grinnell is a lirrle land where you can enjoy
inrellecrual and social freedoms seldom found elsewhere, We all like
ro drink of it rhar way. Currenr srudenrs are paying abour $25,000
per year inro rhe dream. The mosr rangible and valuable producr rhar
you receive foryour good will and money is rhe educarion rhcr Grinnell
passes down rhmugh irs rcachers, iris your righr ro demand rhar rhe
besr reachcrs be acknowledged, rewarded and rerained.

Presldcnr Osgood has rhc final say on YK. Los denial ofrenure.
Wherhcr rhere are nasry polirics behind rhis or jusr plain bad judgcr
menr, somerhing is seriously wrong here. Take rhe rime ro rell Mr.
Osgood whar you rhink ofrhis simarion. ir would be a disservice ro
rhe srudcnr body and all rhar Grinnell college srands for ro lose on
educaror on.1<. Los caliber. Wirhour exceptional lcadcrs, Grinnell
cannor be rhar special place rhar we all wanr ir ro be. By denying Y K.
Lo renure, Mr. Osgood is nor only ignoring rhe opinions ofalumni,
bur also polluring rhe educarion rhar currenr srudenrs are paying for.

Yours in educarion,
