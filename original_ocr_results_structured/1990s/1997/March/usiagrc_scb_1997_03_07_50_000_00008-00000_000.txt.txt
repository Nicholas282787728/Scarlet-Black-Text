great about it. We put forth a solid
team effort. We will only get better

TWO tough losses leave men’s
tennis team unphased

BY BEN SCHOTT
Sports In formation

After two tough road losses at Coe
last weekend, the Grinncll College
men’s tennis team is poised to
bounce back this Saturday at home
against Illinois College andNebraska
Wesleyan. The I.C. conference
match will begin at O. The Flor
users will play Nebraska Wesleyan
at 4:00. with the two Visiting teams
plliying each other at noon.

Grinncll did not play Illinois Col-
legc last year, but Coach Andy
Hamilton says “We're a stronger
team. 1 hope that we'll show it this
weekend." Nebraska Wesleyan
outplayed Grinnell last year in the
Central tournament, but the Pioneers
have improved greatly and Hamilton
cxpceis a good match.

Hamilton said last week that the
match against Coe would serve as a
benchmark forthc rest ol'the season.
In that match the Pioneers scored
more points against the defending
Midwest Conference champion Coe
than they had in the past eight years,
Coc defeated the Pioneers 3-4, and
the University of Wisconsin Lay
Crosse won 1-6. “The Coe match
was very close," said Hamilton. “It
was literally decided by a matter of
a few points. I'm sure that Coe is
going to improve, so we'll have to
improve along with them since then:
is a chance we will play them again
later in the season."

byihe usually ﬂuid doubles team of
Tcpfei‘ and Cal'abas. “Josh and
Thcinios are a great doubles team.
They’re not playing as well as they
will be by the end of the season,"
said Hamilton, “It’s-just a matter of
getting things together."

Although the linal score against
UW La-Crosse was 6-1, most ofthc
matches were close, three singles
matches going three sets. In doubles,
Gi-tnnell won a match against both
teams, and barely lost a second
doubles inntch. There were many
elements on the day which suggested
that Grinnell is putting forth one of
its best men’s tennis teams For ex-
ample, Carabns and Pourcizlu both
made smart adjustments from the
first match to the second, showing a
commitment to sclfriinprovcmeiit
and the mental fortitude to get past
a loss and concentrate on the task at
hand.

Coach Hamilton is excited about
Grinncli's prospects. "I am very
pleased with the talent level on this
team," he Sﬂid. “This weekend we
have tvio home matches and 1 am
snre we will represent outselvcs in ii
positive way."
