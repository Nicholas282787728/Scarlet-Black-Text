Africana studies concentration revamped

BY CHRIS NEARY
Staff Writer

This semester the combined efforts of
faculty arid students have been realized
with the reconstruction of the Afro-
American Studies concentration into a
more interdisciplinary Africana Studies
concentration.

The Africana Studies concentration
will create a broader. more complex disr
cipline with more than twice as many
course options for students. In addition.
the concentration will continue to host its
annual inter-disciplinary conference.
Chair ofthe newly reconﬁgured concen-
tration is Anthropology Professor Katya
Gibel Azoulay.

“The concentration is no longerjust an
extension of the American Studies departr
ment." She said. “In my view, the
concentrations broader prospective is
meant ultimately to call into question all
disciplinary classifications. An interdi5e
ciplinary approach can cause many prace
titioners of existing disciplines to ques

tion their own assumptions. rethink their
orientations and expand their course pa—
rarneters."

One of the benefits of the more inter-
disciplinary approach is that it will mean
greater possibilities for students of all
mayors: “The concentration is Structur-
ally very interdisciplinary in order to en»
courage majors from evcn nolirhumanir
ties backgrounds. like science. to become
involved in Africana Studies." said Pro-
fessor Gibcl Azoulay. “Hopefully those
Students will go back to their science
courses with more questions about the
way the racial conceptions of Black
people have formed scientific research.
The program is establishing a foundation
to go into the let century wliete the tio-
tion of disciplinary boundaries is being
redrawn with lnuch more fluidity."

One major factor in the restructuring
ofthe concentration was the input of stur
dents unsatisﬁed with the program as it
existed under “Afro»Amei'ican Studies."

“Now theprogramhasawide and solid
foundation. I hope it will make Grinnell

As students at Grinnell explore ﬁelds
that interest them, one of the best Opporr
tunities available is to attend off-campus
academic conferences. Grinnell is a small
school, and consequently does not attract
speakers and groups from all Subject are
eas. So where can one go to get such fund—
ing?

The dean‘s office is available to help
students out. “We have at contingency
fund that we are able to pull money out
of to help fund student trips of‘frcampus."
commented Vice-President for Academic
Affairs and Dean of the College Charles
Duke, Offwampus experiences are able
to provide students with current informa-
tion regarding their ﬁeld of interest, much
of which they might have never been able
to be exposed to had their learning been
confined to the college itself.

“Typically I receive rt note from a fac-
ulty member concerning interest in them
attending a conference With a Student.”
Duke mentioned. “It is difficult to meet
the needs of everyone. but we try to fund
as many as pOSSible.”

Currently. the college pulls money out
of the aforementioned contingency fund
which helps to pay for numerous other
things, including individual faculty trips

to conferences. occasional help for Slu- »

dent summer internships. and departmen-
tal budget overages. to name a few. .
“Sometimes things are unavoidable,"
Duke said. as in some cases in which de-
partments go overrbudget and need to
have some degree of financml backing
This backing comes out ofthe same fund
used to pay for student trips to confer-
ences. Additionally. the ofﬁce helps to
fund such things as the adding ofclasses
during the year. “It would be nice to have
money set aside in the future to send stu-

Renowned poet visits Forum
Yusef Komunyakaa to read poetry

Pulitzer prize-winning poet Yusef
Komunyakaa. who served in Vietnam as
correspondent and editor of The South-
ern Cross, will present a lecture and a
reading, both on Thursday. October 16.
in the South Lounge of the Forum. His
lecture. “The Vietnam Experience and
Poetry." will be held at 4:15pm and his
poetry reading will be held at 8pm.

Komunyakaa received a Pulitzer Prize
for Poetry and thc Kingsley Tuft Poetry
Award for “Neon Vernacular: New and
Selected Poems." in 1994.

His books include “DienTai Dau."
“The Second Set." “The Women Carry
River Water." a translation of the poetry
of Nguyen Quattg Thicu, “Magic City"
and "I Apologize for the Eyes in My
Head."

“In the pantheon of pool stereotypes
the vttriolic. passxonate drunkard is one.
the wry acerbic loner another Mr.
Kolnunyakaa,,,is more the dreamy intel-
lcctual. a Wordsworthian type whose
worldly philosophic mindmight be stirred
by something as homely and personal as

a walk in a field of daffodils." \vrotc
Bruce Weber in a New York Times Roe
view,

“His poems. many of which are built
on fiercely autobiographical details about
his stint in Vietnam, about his childhood
deal with the stains thatexperience leaves
on a life. and they are often achingly sug
gestive without resolution," wrote Bruce
Weber in a New York Titties review.

Komunyakaa received his bachelor's
degree. mngiiaeum laude, in English and
sociology from the University of Color
rado. his master's in creative writing. per
etry. from Colorado State University. and
his master‘s of fine arts in creative writ-
ing. poetry. from the University ofCall-
forum at Irvtne.

He is professor of creative writing at
Princeton University. and has served as
visiting professor in English and crcutivc
writing at Washington University. St.
Louis and professuroiEngtisli and Afri-
Calerlnet'icnn Studies at Indiana Univer-
sity. He served thietnatn front 1965 to
1967 and received the Bronze Slat:

much more attractive to scholars ofcnlor.
especially Black scholars. as well as mak—
iiig the current faculty much more open
to the advantages of an interdisciplinary
curriculum." Azoulay commented.

While the concentration's new struce
lure is meant to be implemented over the
course of a decade. Gibcl Azoulay bee
lieves Grinnell will beneﬁt immediately.

“The new way in which the concen»
tratton is being offered requires a lot more
intellectual creativity in planning syllabi
and texts, a resource which I believe is
already one ofthe best parts ofthe Grin-
ncll community."

Professor Glbel Azoulay hopes the
annual conference held by the Africana
Studies department wtll embody in con-
crete example its new goals. “As it was
last year. the conference is effectively tak-
ing the same paper you wrote on a topic
that is not obviously a conference paper.
and seeing the topic with a new perspece
live.” she said. “Student involvement is
essential; without bodies there is no need
for the faculty to feel that the new goals

of the program are a worthwhile illvestr
ment in their classes.”

The conference, which will be held on
April 15. 1998. focuses on issues such
as “the politics of race“, and “the pre-
mises ofthe assumptions about research
in race." Gibel Azoulay hopes students
will beneﬁt from the conference both my
tellectually and on a pragmatic level.

“I see the conference as a forum that
will put into practice theoretical goals.
from which I hope the entire campus will
beneﬁt." Gibcl Azoulay said. “From a
pragmatic standpoint. presenting a paper
in front of a conference is Something
that's going to look good on an resume.
Beyond this. we very much hope the cone
ference will be something that is full,"

The date on which the conference is
to be held,April 15. is not arbitrary. saitl
Gibel Azoulay. “It is timed to be held dur-
ing Passover not only because the chair
of the concentration is Black and lawn
ish. but because the Exodus story is both
a paradigm and a metaphor for libera-
tion struggles of people everywhere."

Women & War in the Middle East

Author Miriam Cooke to give lecture

Women and War in the Middle Em! will
be the topic ofa lecture delivered by our
thor Miriam Cooke on Monday, October
13 at 8pm in Main Lounge. Cooke’s lec-
ture is sponsored by the Rosenfield Pro-
gram in Public Affairs. International Ree
lations and Human Rights. and the Louise
R. Noun Program in Women's Studies.

Cooke was born in 1948. “the year of
the war between the Palestinian Arabs and
the Jews that culminated in the establish
mcnt of the state of tsrael.“ she writes in
the introduction to her book. Women and
the WarSmry.

In her newest book. Cooke writes
about the Algerian war for independence.
the Six-Day War. the Intifada, the Iraq-
Iran War. the Gulf War. and the wars in

Vietnam and Bosnia.

“To the canonical list of Crane,
Sassoon. Remarque and Malraux. we
must now add Khalifa. Tallb and
Nasrallah. These and other Arab women
writers. Miriam Cooke reveals, have used
their radically alternative visions of war
and of the nation in whose name war is
waged." writes author Cynthia Enloe.

Cooke is the acting director of Asian
and African Languages and Literature at
Duke University. Durham. NC. and pros
fessor of Arabic. She received her
master’s degree in Arabic and Islamic
studies, magna cum laude, from
Edinburgh University, Scotland, and her
doctorate in Arabic literature from St.
Antony’s College, Oxford. England.

dents to conferences." Duke commented.
but at present. no such fund exists. Why
isn’t one started?

Carleton College in Northﬁeld. Min-
nesola currently has money set aside for
students to attend academic conferences.
“We have a fund available, called the
President’s Research Fund. which pro-
vides money for students to attend aca»
deinic conferences." stated Betty Pigman.
Secretary to Carleton College acting as-
sociate dean Steve Drew.

Awards are made only after a Student
has provided the ofﬁce with adescription
of his or her plan for how to attend the
conference, as well as a budget, a letter
from a faculty member, and a transcript
to indicate good academic standing.
“Nearly every student who applies for
funding is able to get some money for
their trip." Pigman added.

financial support from their school to ate
tend off»campus conferences. Although
funds are available to Grinnell students,
money for such trips comes out of more
of an all-purpose fund which gives
money to numerous other organizations
on'campus, and for many other projects,
as previously described. Support for the
funding of such trips is not lacking,
though.

“I hear positive comments from face
ulty members all ofthe time." Duke men
tioned. But lines have to be drawn, in
terms of cost. “Trips in which students
and faculty can drive to the conference
are most certainly easier to fund than
those which involve air travel.” Duke
added.

While no steps have been initiated to
create a fund such as Carleton’s. the sug»
