Professor and alum team up to solve
published math problem

Royce Wolf, associate professor of mathematics and
computer science at Grinnell College, and Julia Janik ‘90
have solved a published math problem. Their work. “Axiv
oms for S-pregroups," was published in thejournal Alge-
bra Universalir, Vol. 36 (1996).

“The general problem was to come up with a com-
puter that could always answer yes or no [O a given situa-
tion,“ Wolfsaid, “It’s easy to make a program that allows
the computer to answer ‘yes,’ but not 'no,’ because a ‘no‘
situation can involve a non-terminating calculation. After
running the program for hours, you may believe the an-
swer is ‘no.’ but how would you know? The answer may
be ‘yes,’ and it‘s going to take a few more

hours to say so. or the answer may be ‘no‘ and the
problem will never stop running."

The research project that solved this problem was led
by Wolf and was one of several science and mathematics
projects conducted during summer months, providing stu—
dents with nonrclasstoot‘n research opportunities.

“This was my first summer project, and within the first
year, we had publishable research,” Wolf said.

Wolfreceived two bachelors degrees, one in mathemate
ics and one in music, from California State University,
Northridge, and masters and doctoral degrees in math-
ematics from the University of California, Berkeley.

Ferguson receives Harris ”Fellowship

BY PHOEBE Sl'LAG
Staff Writer

Susan Ferguson, assistant profesV
sor of sociology, is one ofthis year's
recipients of 3 Harris Fellowship.
The fellowship allows junior faculty
members to take a yearlong paid
sabbatical from teaching to do re
search before they receive tenure
Two fellowships are rewarded annu-
ally to third» and fourth»year junior
faculty members.

“Since Grinnell College puts high
priority on teaching. us very diffi-
cult to spend time on scholarship,"
Ferguson said. “The fellowship is a
wonderful gift from the college.”

Ferguson plans to study never-
married Chinese-American and Japa-
nese—American women, a subject that
she has researched for a number of
years. She will spend a year in Calie
fornia interviewing people who fit
this profile. “There is not a large
enough sample of Asian American
women in Iowa,“ she said. “My goal
next year is to collect data."

She became interested in never
married women while working on her
PhD.

”I saw a news report on the detri-
mental effects that not being married
had on single women," Ferguson

said. “They Weren't covered by
health insurance or life insurance.
The never—married women were not
getting the economic benefits that
married women were getting. I
wanted to investigate the conse
quences ofnot being married — both
positive and negative.
Research she

know why, though. I want to inter
view women to find what their atti—
tudes are."

Ferguson has done pilot intervrews
to prepare for next year. She has been
'working with Yayoi Suzuki ‘97, who
did 33 interviews of never-married
women in Japan.

“Yayoi intcrvxcwcd the women in
Japanese,“ Feiguson said. “We‘re
now transcribing them and translat-
ing them back to English.”
Ferguson said she hopes to pub-
lish her findings next year. “There
will eventually be a book," she said,
“but that Wlll take some time.”

Former student Terry Bisson speaks 'to Flannel writers
,‘First hippie’ says Grinnell College has not changed

BY NGOC LOX
Staff Writer

Writer Terry Bisson returned to

Grinnell College Monday for the first
time in 35 years to reminisce about
his days as a hippie student. Bisson,
who attended Grinnell for a year and
a half during the early 19605, read
from his works and shared his inc
sights with Flannel, a campus writ-
ers group, Bisson writes humorous
fantasy short stories, and won the
Hugo and Nebula awards for Bear:
Discover Fire in 1990,
' In a speech entitled The Haircut:
Early ’60s SludemActiviSm at Grin-
nell. Bisson recalled his years as an
unorthodox Grinnellian. Retired En-
glish professor James Kissane called
Bisson “Grinnell's first hippie."

Bisson described his time at Grin-
nell as “a pivotal cusp" and “a ripple
that later became a significant decade
in a lotofpeople's lives." During the
early ‘605, Bisson said, Grinnell still
retained "a shadow of the fraternity
system," marked by the beanles that

younger students made for upper
classmen. However, murmurings of
changing times already could be seen
and felt. Bisson said he remembers
eight or ten people who ”had long
hair, work shirts, chambray shirts and
carried guitars
around." To-
gether they
formed the first
circle of beatnik
types on cam-
pus, he said,

Bisson noted
that he recalls
fondly the fall of
1960 when his
hair was considered “disturbingly
long" by members of the football
team, who broke into his'room, held
him down and gave him an unwel-
come trim, The story allegedly was
reported in the Des Moines Register
and the New York Times.

Rather than deterring the first hlpe
pies of Grinnell, Bisson said. the
haircutting event brought the group

Terry Bisson

“(We) had long hair,
...chambray shirts
and carried guitars

closer and spurred on a multitude of
activities. Hippies began to commu-
nicate with politically motivated
people on campus and students
staged “Operation Abolition," a pre-
cursor of the free speech movement,
Bisson and his
friends marched
for peace and
picketed in and
outside of Grin-
nell. They ”ate In-
dian cactus
[peyote] and had a
vision," and they
fasted for three
days in front of
the White House to protest atmor
spheric testing. Bisson recalled that
Hubert Humphrey, while visiting
campus, advised students against the
White House protest, “Don't do it,"
Humphrey said, according to Bisson,
“You're just going to help the RusV
,sians." But students proceeded,
caught up in the fervor of social ac-
tivism.

around. ”

Despite the exciting times at Grin-
nell, Bisson said he had an urge to be
beatnik, to be a part of the world, to
“get out and do it.” The feeling in-
spired him to hitchhike out of Grin-
nell without graduating and make his
way as a long-haired radical into a
world still wary of the unwanted.

Although 35 years have passed,
Bisson said he felt not much has
changed since the days when Grinr
nell first began to move toward stuA
dent activtsm. Intellectual vigor and
social activism are positive aspects
of Grinnell that were heightened by
the student movement of the early
‘605, Bisson said.

Though Bisson's hair is much
shorter now, students hypothesized
that Grinnell‘s flrst hippie hasn't
changed so much, either. “He doesn’t
act at all famous," said Ben Stallings
‘98. “He's very approachable and
friendly, with the kind of modesty that
comes from the heart rather than the
conscience. I’m honored to have had
the chance to meet him."

New vegan co—op offers home—COOked alternative

BY MAX JULIAN MULLER
Staff Writer

When Joshua Trost ‘97 was a sopho—
more, Grinnell College Dining Services
posted a list of ingredients for all meals
served in the dining halls. Trosi and other
vegans were shocked to learn from this list
that a potato dish labeled “vegan" in fact
contained beef fat. That year, an outraged
Trost petitioned a California-based Vegan
rights group to pursue a lawsuit against
Dining Services,

Though the law suit fell through because
the group had no lawyers in the area, Trosi
and many other vegans and vegetarians on
campus still say they‘ve lost their faith in
Dining Services. This semester, they've
forged a new altemanve: a Vegan cooking
co-op. The Coup meets at 6 pm at vari
ous locations Sundays through Thursdays.

Trosi said he became a vegan two years
ago in response to environmental issues.
especially cattle grazing. Cattle meat pron
ducuon is a wasteful way to produce food
in light of world hunger, Trosi said Beef
cattle feed on a majority of the world‘s grain
supply, Slnce he has become a vegan, Trost
said his concern for animal rights has
grown, The vegan co-op provides vegans
motivated by a variety of reasons With a
way to share the work and costs of eating
vegan meals.

According to Trosi, the coop has 22
members and is in lts ﬁfth week, Ten to 15
members gather five nights per week to

enjoy a vegan meal that one of them has
prepared. Each member must specify how
many group dinners per week they will par—
ticipate in, and each pay $2 per meal. The
money goes to a fund through which the
co-op can order vegan food in bulk, The
group recently ordered its second month ’5
worth of bulk food,

Cerop meals are prepared by members
who eat four to five meals per week with
the group, Trost said. Members who eat
less frequently simply help with clean.
up, Those who cook must help prepare
one meal per week. Many of the recipes
are based on improvisation, while others
are taken from vegan and vegetarian
cookbooks. Cooks choose ingredients
from the co-op's bulk stock, which in-
cludes brown rice. black beans,
chickpeas, lentils, carrots, potatoes, garr
lic, wheat and rye flour, tofu, cous cous.
tempe and an array of seasonings. In ad
dition, the cooks for each meal may take
$5 to 57 out of the group fund to use to
spice up their recipes with fresh ingredi»
ents. Most of the co-op food is organic.

Though Trost was the principle orga-
nizer of the group, he noted that there is no
longer a group leader. He said he has been
surprised by the group's success.

“I expected ten or maybe 15 people at ’

the most," he said.

When the group first started. Trosi said
there were a few problems that had to be
sorted out. During the ﬁrst week, the price
was 51,50 per meal. The coeop decided that

the price would be increased fifty cents be-
cause the extra money would enable them
to buy more splces.

-How do co-op meals compare to meals
in the dining halls‘.7

“Much better." Trost said, “[It‘s] truck-
loads bettcr than the dining hall Even if
you aren‘t a vegan."

Recent coeop meals have been mashed
potatoes and onions boiled inside ofwheat
dough pockets, and broccoli stir fry with
temps and cous cous.

According to Trosi, the vegan co-op has

a diverse membership and “is a fun group
to eat wtth.” Many of the co-op members
aren’t vegans, and some aren‘t even veg-
etarian. While there aren't currently any
faculty members, Trost emphasized that
faculty are welcome to join the group as
well. Newcomers may try a free meal and
are welcome to join at anytime, he added.
Anyone who doesn‘t want to be a regular
group melnber may eat with the group for
$3 per meal and isn't required to help with
clean-up or meal preparation, Interested
people should vax [TROST].
