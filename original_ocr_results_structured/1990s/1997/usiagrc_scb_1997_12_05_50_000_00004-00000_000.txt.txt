Jeremy goes to the movies—ha! Turn on the radio

King of the Tolbertians, Jeremy salivates over
three of Hollywood’s slickest soldiers.

First, I have a couple of comments
to tnake about my last reVlcw, I‘m
Sorry I told you to go see the bands.
I still see spots from the llghtshow
that was specially chlgned to blind
the audience. Too bad they didn’t
have a system set up to denfen me.
The other thing I would like to say is
that I take back everything I said
about Gary Oldman (which wasn’t
much), My opinion on his perfor-
mance in Fifth Element stands, but
the boy rocks in several films:
Rorencmntz and Gltl‘idetlrterri are
Dead and The Prafenlotml just to
name a couple, Gary Oldman abso-
lutely rocks as Rosencrantz, No, I
mean, he rocks as
Guildenstern. Anyway, on to
the reviews,

First on our list guns, lire-
works, and about ﬁve thousand
years of therapy. The director
of Face/Off, John Woo has
wooed us (sorry, I couldn‘t re-
sist) with several films from his
Hong Kong days; most known
among them is The Killer. The
Killeris, as I am told, the movie
that holds the record for most
amount of ammunition ex»
pended during filming. I’m
curious after watching Face/0f
whether or not this record still
stands. He’s also disappointed
us wtth bombs such as Broken
Arlaw (a movie about bombs, how
ironic). I think I'd rank Face/Q02 the
latest ﬁlm, as amid-range film ofhls.

Okay, if you have a problem with
suspension ofdisbelief, this film will
give you nightmares. Believing in
the premise of [his movie is akin to
having to convince yourself that
ARH has suddenly become a large
beached whale, One that speaks flu-
ent Portuguese And sings opera-
style. But hey, if you don't have
problems swallowing something like
that, then you’ll have some fun with
this ﬁlm, The idea is that in the be-
ginning, John Travolta stars as an
FBI agent out for vengeance against

a terrorist who killed his son in a
botched attempt on his own li'fe.'

Nicolas Cage is Castor Troy, a tern
rorist with a butt fetish. I think the
butt fetish is a nice touch. He also
has such memorable lines as “Would
you be grateful lfl let you suck my

tongue‘l" Anyway, the movie starts
out wtth tlle FBI aliasing Troy, and
he gets put into a coma as a result.
So, the good guys win and the movie
lasts about ten minutes, right? Well,
to complicate things, they learn that
Troy had built a bomb, and only he
and his brother (who was sent to
prison) knew where it was, It’s a
big bomb, and you know how the
FBI is about big bombs. The only
person Troy's brother would ever, In
a million years, reveal the location
to is his brother (who already knows,
so why would he want to know?) So,
the FBI decides that they will use
their superahlgh tech facilities (don't

laugh) equipped with lasers to slice
off the face of Troy and put it back
on John Travolta’s character, who of
course must have his face taken off
for this process, This is all to save
face over the whole bomb thing
(ouch, okay, no more puns), The
surgery is really complicated and in-
volves a lot of superrglue, at least, it
might as well So theysurgically al-
ter the FBI agent, Archer, and send
him to prison as Troy so he can find
the location of the bomb. Mean
while, comarboy snaps our, calls his
goons (it’s really funny listening to
Nicolas Cage try to talk wtthout lips)
and they round up all the scientists
and people who knew *anything*
about the procedure, make them turn
him into John Travolta, and that’s
when the fun *really" starts. of
course they are all killed, and now
no one knows that the two have
switched. DidImention that the FBI

agent has a wife and a teenage daugh-
ter? That‘s where the serious tiliunta
comes in.

The only thing I could think about
during this whole movie wns‘the
years and years of therapy tlleArchcr
family was going to need by the end.
“Mommy, why is daddy holding a
gun to my head, and why is the guy
who killed my brother trying to save
me?" Psychologists have erotic
dreams about this sort of thing,
Watch for the end when something
really psychologically screwed up
happens. The other sad thing is that
John Travolta pretending to be
Nicolas Cage pretending to be John
Travolta is better in bed and
rekindles his love life with his
wire. Don’t you think you'd
know a little bit about how
your husband has sex after
twenty years of marriage or
so? I don‘t think she was come
plaining though, butyou know
what she’s thinking when she
finds out who she’s really
been sleeping with,

Lots of people get shot with
big guns in this movie. I
started laughing during the
firefights because any time a
bullet misses, someone sets
off a bottlerocket. You can
hear them, I swear. The fire—
works that are intended to
make the shoot-outs more interestv
ing make me think of bad Fourth of
July displays. Also, watch for the
sideways dives, guns in both hands
blaring. They do that about two
dozen times, The unnecessary acro-
batics make things fun.

The acting in this film ranges from
superb to “you idiot." Nicolas Cage
is clearly more versatile than John
Travolta, I liked Pulp Ficttortjust as
much as the next person, but let dead
actors lie. IfI see this man light one
more cigarette I'm going to puke.
The visuals are a little like John
Travolta's acting style: over the top
The ﬁnal ﬁght scene is almost idenr
tlcal to Killer. It involves churches
and lots of doves, Just once I would
like to see someone shoot one ofthe
doves out of the air for fun. Now
*that" is symbolism, The most im-
portant thing about this movie is that

Part eight in an on-going
series of KDIC deejay

interviews

BY DAVID NATHAN
StaffWritcr

“Ladies of Music" is the name of
tltc show, and they‘ 1] play any female
artist except Jewel. Or Spice Girls.
0r anything country, But co-Dls
Rian Sands and Emily Cripe do play'
oldies, 80‘s, 90's and a French song
or two, They even do interviews

DN: How did Ladies in Music
come to be?

EC: I came here with the idea that
I wanted to have a radio show and
knowing how everyone is around
here and the music that everyone
likes around here, I knew that they
[KDIC] would definitely pick up a
show of all female artists.

RS: That’s alot ofcorifidence you
have in yourself, Emily.

EC: What‘.7 V

RS: We were like . you weren't
that conﬁdent - we were trying to
make our play list broad to ensure it
would get in. It worked.

DN: How about you, Rian? Were
you planning on having a show?

RS: Absolutely not. But [did have
a friend in high school who had a
radio show at her school and I
thought it was a really cool thing. I
Just would have never imagined that
I could do one myself but Emily

flopped on the resolution of it all
(guess who comes to live with the
Archer family, heh heh. Traumal).
The most fun I’ve gotten out of this
is imagining what sort of bills the
therapists can charge for trying to
sort it all out. In the end, I give this
ﬁlm two out ofvfour'EILLION years
of therapy.

Lori Bay: is the best vampire
movie ever made. It involves the
young Corey duo kicking some butt
as mini Van Helsings, I recommend
it to anyone who hasn’t seen it. My
rating for Lost Boys is 3 and a half
grandp'as. That character carries the
film

wanted to and I asked lfI could do it
with her and she said sure.

DN: We're coming up on the end
of the semester. Has your show
evolved and iflt has, how?

EC: We've run out of music and
have made some stretches.

RS: Like into the cartoon world.

EC: Like Lisa Simpson and
BeaVJs and Butthead and Cher.

RS: (Knowing chuckle)

EC: We've kind of stretched it a
few times wtth theme shows where
we played songs with women's
names in the titles instead ofJust
music performed by female artists or
bands with female lead singers.

RS: The DJ before us has asked
us about our [play list] a few times,
but we've reassured her, saying ‘Heyl
This is women,‘

DN: Do you have any dedicated
listeners?

EC. Yeah, we have a few. Most
of them are our friends, but we have
a townie listener named Dan the
Sinatra Man and one certiﬁed real
listener who doesn‘t know us named
John.

RS: We know he‘s a dedicated lisr
tenet because one day we said we had
one dedicated listener, meaning Dan.
John called us up and said ‘I listen
to your show and I‘m not your friend!
Will you play something for me?‘

DN: Did you? .

( EC: Nah, we didn’t have [the song
he requested]. But we plan to.

DN: How do you sum up your
experience being Dis at Grinnell'l

EC: I’d do it again, but I probably
won't have time next semester. ‘

RS: I’d do it again ifI had some-
one to do it with. It’s a lot work, but
I don’t feel that it's been a life altera
ing experience.

EC: Mine has! I know I want to
be a DJ when I get out ofhere.

The BeV corner by Pam Vicsik andAden Beihl :Saturday:

For all you bio freaks, you'll ap-
preciate this episode‘s interest in
those wacky organisms, vertebrates.
Evolutionists Will be proud to see
David ﬁnally develop the backbone
he‘s been lacking of late. Even
Donna transferred some ofthe struc-
lural rigidity ofherchestinto herown

Kelly got some help with her central
“nervous" system from a seemingly
benevolent doctor with an ulterior
motive. ‘ -

Young Silver has given up on
groveling ior Donna’s love, Never»
theless, his latest tactics of misdi-
rected bitterness toward the ever»nau-
tical Boat Boy have only succeeded
in exacerbating his loneliness and
alienation, Itseems his warped sense
of prldc is causing him to stalld up
tor convictions that have no basis in
the realm of reality. Secretly, he has
to know that Boat Boy helped him
with the club as a friend, and Donna
ended tlicir'sexcapades 'not because
she had been coveling Noah and his
“vessel." but because DaVid is Just
dumb, not to mention untrustworthy

After David waved his white flag at
Noah and surrendered the Peach Pit
After Dark to his control, his des-
perately unemployed status spurred
him to seek a tiew vocation as Inso-
lent Clothes-Folder at Khaki Nation.
This new backbone sure came in
handy here. After experiencing the
oppressive world of trendy retail for
two whole days he himself didn‘t
fold; ﬁnally he just ripped offhis red
polo work shirt and stormed off,
leaving the garment in a rumpled
heap at the feet of his overly anal
supervisor. How ‘bout them
creases?!

The other half of the old Martini
Silver Duo exerted her own aur
tonomy as a Grotesque Young
Woman. making it clear that if she
wanted to frolic in the brlny deep
with Boat Boy there was no way her
mother could shame her into doing
otherwtse. Of course, once Mrs.
Martin came to know ofNoah’s exr
cessive wealth, she was happy to
welcome him into her troll's, um,
daughter’s life.

QUAD TIP OF THE WEEK:
Well, the problem got so bad that
there had to be signs made. We’re
talking, of course, about the sneeze
guards on the salad bar and the pro-
pensity for some Quad diners to e14
evate the barrier between their rough-
age and snottage. Some may argue I
that the hinges at the top are there I
for a reason, and they are right. Howe
ever, their purpose is not to serve
shortrarmed lazy people, but rather I
to aid the diligenl'Quad staff in the
regular cleaning of the salad bar.
Especially in this season, when “1'
ﬁrmny runs rampant, no one can'be

It’s that kind of false conﬁdence that
could eventually result in a new fla-
vor of dressing: Hidden Valley Mu-

This was the best film I saw this
summer, bar none, Peter Fonda
hasn‘t appeared in top form since

is Easy Rider days, it he:
appeared since then at all.

As a F] 'dian bee eper Fonda

plays a patient grandfather trying to I
stabilize his chaotic family.
Fonda’s family is tainted with
robbery. drug abuse. and prison
sentences, and his treatment of his
family is likened to his occupa-
tional behavior. As a beekecper
attempting to tame hives of
anarchical bees, he exhibits similar I
emotional tactics to how he deals
with his family. I
Fonda's struggle is a quiet one,
which brings up one of the few
commonlyrmentioned gripes about
the ﬁlm: it‘s boring. Idon’t agree
in the least; the ﬁlm‘s healthy
conglomoration of imagery,
character upheaval, and subtle
conflict is plenty for me. Still, if
you‘re looking for_action, you may
want to check out Fach/finstead l
Victor Nunez gives a marvelous
performance unraveling a tale that I
eventually warms the heart. Home I
Improvements PatriCia Richardson
co-stars, but Fonda‘s really the one
to watch here. -Ed.

Directed by Stuart Rosenberg and
starring Paul Newman and George
Kennedy, Newman portrays Luke
as an abused chain-gang member
who’s not about to take it any
