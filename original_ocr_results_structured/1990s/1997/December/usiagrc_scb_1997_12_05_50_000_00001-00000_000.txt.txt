The Party Phenomenon Known As

BY YASUKO TAOKA
Staff Writer

The temperature has fallen, the leaves
have fallen, snow has fallen. .

Yes, Grinnellians, it's that time ofyear
again—Waltz Time

Every December, Grinnellians dress up
in everything from formal wear to bond-
age gear to attend the party phenomenon
known as Winter Waltz.

Year after year this traditional formal
dance has made its appearance, worming
its way into the hearts of Grinnellians. It
has maintained this hold on campus well
into the nineties. One student attributed
the appeal of waltz to “the certain Victor
rian quality of it in the middle of
Bumblef**k, Iowa.” Only 200-300
people each year decline tojoin in on the
frivolity.

Mierecember may seem to be daunt-
ing timing # the middle of the last two
weeks before ﬁnals, when the last thing
anyone wants to do is ruin further their
GPA's. Strangely, the date has been found
to be a great relief in the midst of pre-
ﬁnals mania.

Events begin in the early evening,
when some students choose to venture out
into town to eat dinner at a restaurant.
Others cook for themselves, and many eat
in the dining halls.

Waltz.
Although ninety percent of attendees
arrive donning customary fomlal wear,

of

Waltz is also a good opportunity for
people to express their creativity. Cross
dressing is a visible style of attire at
Waltz, consisting of mostly males in
dresses. Several years ago, a student was
spotted at Waltz in a unicorn outﬁt. Un-
fortunately, some of her partners found
it difﬁcult to dance with a horn protrud-
ing from her forehead.

Other notables include a bubble wrap
dress, praised for its excellent construc-
tion and a Robert Smith (lead singer of
The Cure) look-a-like. Another student
who was an excellent seamstress made
an entire traditional ball goWn.

The Harris Center opens its doors at
nine, and stays open until midnight. Be-
cause most of the campus attends, it‘s a
good chance to see lots of new faces.
Some arrive in groups, others in couples,
and some come solo. Faculty are also in-
vited to attend, and several do.

There is no need to become stressed
looking for a partner, though. Charles
Cowles ‘98 remarked that “Everyone
dances with everyone else." Waltz les-
sons were offered in Gardner Lounge for
those with two left feet, but suave moves
aren’t a requirement for attending Waltz.
Amber Marsh ‘00 said, "No one knows
how [to dance], but nobody really gets

Presidential search continues amidst student protest
Students efforts to expand representation turned down by Trustees

BY COURTNEY SHERWOOD
News/Features Editor

Following a rejected attempt by stu-
dents io increase their presence on the
PreSidential Search Committee, the hunt
for a replacement for Pamela Ferguson
continues.

A group of students, dissatisfied wtth
the composition ofthe Trustee-dominated
search committee, wrote several letters of
protesi to the Trustees and the campus
community in late November. One letter
mandated that student—elected Gabe
Rodriguez ’00 be allowed to serve along-
side SGA President Erin Childress '98 on
the search committee. A total of 632 stu-
dents signed a petition sent tO trustees.

In a response to students, Chair of the
Board of Trustees Elizabeth Ballantinc.
who is also On the Presidential Search

Committee. addressed concciiis regard:
ing increased student representation. "In
order to operate efficiently and to tillow
members of the board and the search com-
mittee time to recruit, develop and evalu-
ate candidates,” she said, " it is iinpoi unit
that the committee be small enough to
function efﬁciently."- As it result, no addir
tional students will be allowed to Join the
search Commlttee.

Ballantlne pointed out that some instir
iuiions do not include students in the
search process atoll, In addition, she high
lighted the importance of communication
between representatives and students. as
well as trustees and students. "[W]e tiusi-
ees will continilc to listen Carefully to all
members ofthe college Community," shc
said.

Despite the concerns of some students,
Ballantine stood bchind Chlldress's tlpr

potntinent, saying “I am not inclined to
change the number or makeup of the
Search Committee."

Rodriguez was not pleased with this
response ncc again, the trustees have
shown their disregard for any student in-
put." he said. “It’s basically a slapin the
face. They have their own agenda and they
don’t really care what students have to
sity,"

Rodriguez is part of a group of students
that is unhappy with the current state of
the search committee. Kate Jones ‘99, one
of the students responsible for the reac-
tion against current procedures, said in an
email to students, “Although we're glad
that the trustees share our ‘concerns about
tolerance for minorities‘ on campus, I
think they somewhat missed the message
here."

This afternoon at 4:15pm, students

will be meeting in the Forum Coffee»
house to discuss future actions. It is pos-
sible, Jones said, that students will con-
tinue to push for Rodriguez’s acceptance
on the board. “I would at least like to see
him recognized as a source to turn to as
a representative of students," she said,
Other students have a different view
of the trustees and their decisions regard-
ing the search process. “We need to start
communicating instead of protesting,"
said Emily Bell '00. Bell admitted that
the trustees have not always acted in ace
cord with student wishes, but she also
pointed out recent efforts by the search
committee to gather student feedback.
“This is a wonderful opportunity to open
the lines of communication, and being
antagonistic is not going to do it," she
said.

A Community of Individuals: Controversy Surrounds Admissions Literature

BY YASUKO TAOKA
Staff Writer

Grinncll College’s admissions litera»
ture is created to recruit prospectives. but
it has been under scrutiny by students as
painting an inaccurate portrayal of the
college. In particular, questions surround
“A Community of Individuals," a bro-
chure aimed at prospective students of
color, Several students included in the
brochure claim that they ‘are inisquoted
and misrepresented,

Alex Casillas ‘98 stated that he raised
the issue of accuracy when he first found
problems with the brochure almost two
years ago. The Ofﬁce ofPublic Relations,

Feature Story:

which co-produccd the brochure with the
Ofﬁce ofAdinissions, expressed surprise.
“It‘s the first I’ve heard of this," come
mented Denise Lamphter, ASSIStanl Dir
rector.

Casillas is quoted in the brochure as
saying: “I attended a few meetings [of
SOL] and came to reﬁne thni the group
could provide me with a perfect opportu-
nity to educate myself on those things I
felt were missing from oi [ticking in my
home," However: Casillas feels that he
was misquoied: ' ‘s not at all what I
said "

Although Cnsillns docs find support
through SOL, he has novel l'cll anything
was inisstng from or lacking iu‘llis home

The Office of Public Relations main-
tains that It has “double-checked quotar
lions [and] based on the paperwork and
files. . .[tlie brochure] is accurate.” How-
ever. the original notes ofinterviews could
not be found making it impossible to de-
termine who is at fault.

This could be an isolated incident, yet,
many othci students besides Casillas sug-
gest that they were misrepresented in the
brochure. '

Shaina Dooley ‘98 said, “Whenl spoke
[to Public Relations]. I believed what I
stud ,.l wouldn't say that now " Adrienne
Eiiriqiicz ‘98 agrees, “It paints a very posir
live picture which is not necessarily true."
She feels that the brochure does not ad-

dress many important aspects of
multiculturalism at Grinnell. .Casillas
also concurred: “lt’s portrayed as really
happy. . ,I don't think it’s as great as. . .it
claims to be, as far as multiculturalism
is concerned." ‘

Lamphier felt that the brochure por-
trayed “both good and bad at Grinncll in.-
a fair and balanced manner." unaware of
the discrepancy in the views of the Of»
fice ofPublic Relations and the students.

The reason for the discrepancy may
lie in the inherent nature of the document
as a piece of admissions literature. As
such, its primary purpose is to recruit stun
dents.

The Trials and Tribulations of Off-Campus Housing

BY MARGARET FRANCE
Staff Writer

As if Gi'innelljuniors and seniors don’t
have enough to worry about, the various
problems that come With the privtlege of
llvlng Offrcampus can become 2i sizable
burden. At the center of some of these
difﬁculties is an unsatisfactory relation
ship between tenant and landlord.

In years past, the college's role in as
sisting students with offcampus housing
was limited to a list of local landlords'
names and phone numbers. The list of
over twenty names was old enough to in»
cludc notonly the names oflandlords who
no longer rented to students, but the names
of landlords who had been deceased for
several years,

In response to these difficulties, House
ing Director Steve Larson has updated the
list During the summcr, Larson called
each landlord listed in order to find out

what so many siutlcnis have discovered
