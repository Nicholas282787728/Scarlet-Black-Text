High school seniors get help online

To help high school seniors pick the right college,
US. News Online‘s College & Career Center is offer-
ing “Student to Student," a forum to let prospective
freshmen ask current college students about schools.

April is the time when millions of high school se-
niors are faced with the all-important choice: Which
school should it be? For many seniors, that decision
can be stressful (Is this the best school for me? What
is campus life there really like?) Many of these stu-
dents could use some input, and that’s where current
college students come in at U.S. News Online's Col-
lege & Careers site (http://www.usnews.com).

Starting this week, “.edu,“ the College dc Careers
Center ofU.S. News Online (http://www.usnews.com)
will be inviting high school seniors from across the
country to their “Get Into College” forum to ask ques»
tions to current college students, college staff mem-
bers and parents of students. Questions may range from
academics and workloads to extracurricular activities
and dorm life.

Current college students who are interested in par—
ticipating may visit “.edu“ at http://www.usnews.com/
usnews/edul. At that site, students should click on a
big “Student to Student” graphic that will lead to a
page with more information about the “Get Into Col-
lege" forum, where many students, parents and guid—
once counselors already have posted questions and
answers.

Upon entry into the forum, feel free to post a mes—
sage about your school to let prospective students know
you are there. US. News Online suggests typing your
school's name on the message subject line so others
can quickly ﬁnd your college First-time users of this
forum will beneﬁt from simple logon instructions on
that page that will explain the process more thoroughly.
Students are expected to post messages in this ex-
change from Monday April 21 through the end of the
month when college decisions are needed.

Questions about this project may be directed to
Kenan Pollack at kpollack@usnews.com or Amy
Harrison at aharrison@usnews.com.

2001: An admissions odyssey

BY PHOEBE SILAG
Staff Writer

Sunshine and blue skies are upon us,
and along with spring weather come pro»
spective Grinnellians in droves. Each
year, rumors and predictions about the
incoming class

to 20 percent increase in the number of
prospective high school students who visit
campus, Cuseo said.

Dara Finkelstcin, 17, a prospective
from Eugene. Ore, ﬁrst heard about Grin»
nell through a friend‘s mom.

“She‘s a leuchcr, and some of her slu»

There were 113 prospectives on cam-
pus the weekend of April 18. the largest
number of students for a prospective
weekend ever, according to Cuseo.

Griffin Knodle, 17, a prospective from
Vashon Island. Wash, arrived April 17.

accept are very intriguing people as well
as very good, motivated students. The
overall quality will just be strengthened
some due to this year's large number of

applicants.” ,
The rising number of qualiﬁed appli-
cants will affect Grinnell’s acceptance
rate, and although

Will they continue to
be, as one student re»

Grinnellians, the “kids
you hated in high
school with a propen-
sity towards
piercings?"
Whatever the buzz
on the grapevine, the
class of 2001 has faced
a considerably more

years.

“We've had an in»
crease in the number of
students who submit-
ted at least part oftheir
applications," ex-
plained Vince Cuseo,
director of admissions.
“In terms of completed
applications, there is a‘

“deﬁnitive numbers
aren’t in yet," Cuseo
lg estimated that about
‘ 60 percent of appli-
cants will be offered
an invitation to at»
tend Grinnell.

“The acceptance
rate will go down,"
he said. “The total
enrollment is ap-
proximately 1300
students, and the
size of each class
remains stable.
We’ll be more se-
lective this year
than we’ve been in
past years, which is
the beneﬁt and dis
advantage of be
coming more popu-
lar. We can‘t admit
everyone who is ca-
pable of doing the
academic work. It’s
somewhat guess-
work because we
don't know exactly

 

 

20 percent increase
over last year. That’s the largcst number
of complete applications we've ever re»
ceived, and the increase is pretty much
spread over the country, and actually, the
globe. It’s been a very good year."

Cuseo attributed the increase to a “gen
eral satisfaction with the experience of
Grinnell" and positive publicity in the
media, including the college’s inclusion
in a recently published book. College:
that Change People’s Liver. Although
staffmembers ofthe Grinnell admissions
ofﬁce visits about 600 high schools each
year, Cuseo said he does not think that
the high school visits are what have
caused the number of applications to in-
crease. Instead, the high school visits have
helped contribute to the “people connec-
tions" that play a large role in the process
of applying to Grinnell.

“Grinnell is a small, word~of~m0ulh
school," Cuseo said. “Direct personal con
tact makes a difference. We’re doing more
ofthat than ever before."

Grinnell admissions now arranges
Close to twice as many alumni interviews
than ever before, and there has been a 15

dcnls went to Grinnell," Finkelstcin said.
Finkelsleitt visited Grinllell to tour the
campus and talk to professors and stu»
dents.

“I deﬁnitely got a better feel for the
school and how people are at the school."
Finkelstcin said. ”Al Smith, I could prac-
tically taste the wealth in the air, and that‘s
not my background. People alGrinncll arc
Iiiendly, and people at the other schools
were friendly. but they didn‘t go out of
their way. Grinncll seems more real and
not so intellectual or out»of»reach, which
is a good thing."

Grinnell admissions arranges prosper,»
tive weekends each year, usually the last
three weekends of April. “We hold a re
ception, Which is actually a number of ac-
tivities spread over the course of several
days," Cuseo said. “They are structured,
and they include presentations from fac»
ulty, administrators, a student panel, and
even n parent puncl. Admitted students
come at other times, but May 1 is the
deadline for prospectivcs to decide
whether they want to come to Grinnell,
so April IS a very hectic month."

said. “I thought it was really cool. It was
neat to meet students who would be in
my class if I came to Grinnell. That was
actually one of the things about my visit
that really impressed me. It was comfort-
ing being with other prospectives. I didn‘t
feel cut off or like I was drifting.”

”The main thing that’s going to deter-
mine where I go is the gut feeling I get
when I visit a college," Finkelstein said.
"Statistics out of a brochure don‘t mean
much. and I don‘t care what location I’m
in. Seeing how students react with each
other and how they interact with me will
make the difference."

Although the number of applicants
have increased, Cuseo said he feels gen-
eral characteristics of the student body in
next year‘s class will not change dramati-
cally in comparison to past years. “We
have a very selfrselected applicant group,“
Cuseo said..“Students usally do their re—
search. The proﬁle of the incoming class
doesn’t differ from year to year. We at-
tract a very intellectually curious, intel-
lectually engaged group. Our students are
diverse and individualistic. The people we

how many students
will take us up on our offer."

The admissions ofﬁce begins reading
applications in midJanuary and usually
ﬁnishes in mid»March.

“The criteria for admission is set by
the faculty,” Cuseo said. “We have to
quantify it to some extent. Particularly
as we get more selective, we have to dis
eliminate who will make the biggest con-
tribution. The decisions we make are
weighted; 50 percent rests with academic
performance. The best predictor of how
well a student will do in college, accord»
ing to all the studies, rests on academic»
performance in high school." An a'ddiv
tional 25 percent of the decision is based
on standardized test scores. and the ﬁnal
25 percent on “promise of contribution."
which includes “out-of—class activities,
depth and breadth of involvement, and
anything else that would contribute to the
classes and clubs at Grinnell."

“The critical part of the process is to
make appropriate, sensible, well»rea»
soned decisions," Cuseo said, “so that we
are fair to both the student and the
school."

Fog Fast'to help fight AIDS

BY Kcvnv MCGOLDRICK
Staff Writer

In mid l 996, 529,999 AIDS cases were
reported across the U.S. to the Atlanta-based
CcnterforDisease Control. Atolal of 932 cases
were reported in the state of Iowa However.
since Iowa has been relatively slow in identi»
fyingcases ofHIV positive andAlDS infected
individuals, the number is likely much higher.
Powell Dixon ‘98, a member of Grinnellians
Escalating AIDS Response (GEAR), said he
attributes the slow response toAIDS and HIV
treatment in panic lackof action by Iowa Gov.
Terry ansmd, whom Dixon claims has been

 

unreccptive to the issue. The good news, Dixon
said, is that “recent trends in the number of
estimated AIDS patients illusuate the overall
slowing In the rate of growth ofthe/ups epi»
demic," according to the CDC. Even so, the
number of identiﬁed cases seem to be rising
in the rural U.S. CDC statistics show dial be-
tween the middle of 1995 and 1996. the num-
ber ofAl'DS cases increased by 86% in Iowa.

Tonight GEAR has organized a Fog Fast
to misc money for the Central Iowa AIDS
Project of Iowa. a non—profit organization that
provides a number of beneﬁts for AIDS pa-
uems including a food pantry. housing subsi»
dies, cducalional programs and a referral ser-

vice. Dixon said GEAR expects to raise be,
lween$1500 and $2,000 through theFogFast
for Iowa AIDS patients. Students have sta-
tioned themselves outside dining halls during
the past week to collecl names and 1D num»
bers for Dining Services, who will donate a
pan of each meal’s cost to the cause. Those
who plan to eat on campus tonight must eat at
Cowles. as Quad will be closed. Some local
restaurants including .limbo’s, Paglai’s and
Subway have agreed to help with Fog Fast
fund raising, Dixon said. Students who eat in
town should inform the server and manage»
ment they are participating in Fog Fast, and

participating businesses will donate to the
GEAR event. he noted.

“Once you tell people what you‘re doing.
they're very recepnvc," Dixon said.

Through the years there have been about
39 fasts. which have raised close to $50,000,
according to Dixon. Fog Fast began irl 1977,
according to Dave McConnell, director of
Dining Services. In those days there didn't
seem to be as many visible means for stu-
dents to express their suppon for issues,
McConnell said, adding that he thought the
ﬁrst Fog Fast may have had something to do
with the formation of the United Farm Work»
ers Union. At the time, anumber of students
reportedly pressured Dining Services to boy-
cott nonvunion foods. Dining Services did not
boycott. which may have been a reason for
student groups to organize a fast. McConnell
noted. Amer the initial fast, McConnell said,
the "focus [of Fog Fast has been] on an orga-
nizationthatpiovides humanitarian services."
McConnell added that he avoids using Fog
Fast to contribute to political causes. Previ-
ous successful projects have included fasting
for Habitat for Humanity, ﬂood and mm-
cane relief. McConnell said he believes that
the earlier fasts have fared better than more
recent efforts, possibly because of the switch
to more“customizedboardplans,"whichhas
meantadecreaseinstudents regularly attend-
ing the dining halls. Previously, Dining Ser-
vices offered a choice between a lit—meals

tributing one meal out of 21 to Fog Fast1
