SGA President

1 would like to welcome you back

of the SGA Beat Last semester we
used this coluiirii as a means to pmr
vide you with details about the posir
tions airtl committees that make up
SGA, to update yotr on the |llttjccts
and ISSUES \vc \vctc wot king on, and
even to express our view on a cnn~
troyetsial issue which had come bc~
fore the student hotly. ’l‘liis semester
we will continue to do more ol the
same. Next week you will and the
results or the phone poll we coir
ducted last semester itr ivlricli yoti
shared with its your vrews on the
success ol‘SGA,

The creation ol'th.
of the tiiariy ways we worked to inr
crease cotriiiiuiiieatioii between stu
dents. l'aciilty, administration, and
Trustees. When yotr questioned why
police ot'tieers were biking through
our campus. tie ananged a discus
sion with a representative of the For
lice Department. When the contior
versy surrounding an ad in the GUM
created strong emotions on campus,
we facilitated communication
through an open loruni At Joint
Board yort were tiblo to tell us
whether or not you sitpport having a
smoking loungc in the forum, We
also provrded a means tor you to
present your own proposals to the
administration through Student liii—
tlatives, each of which has alicady
,bccrt answered or is hci it looked at
'by a committee riglri now

We also gathered arid responded to

SGA wrll continue to bean impor-
tairt institution on this campus, Fur»
tliei, we are answering any cri icism
\\c received last semester. SGA Was
accused oi getting bogged down with
too many mater tli. concerns, and
therefore slowing dowir the process
or ﬁnding solutions to larger issues
We have altered the structure of our
meetings to avoid this problem.
Some students questioned why we
have ﬁnancial limitations with stlch
rt large endutttrnent, The college trea—
sitter will answer this question at an
upcorrruu ioiut Board meeting We
limo llcril'tl l'ruln you that the role ol
the Hall Councils is unclear. The
Coiiriiultee on Stridcirt Lite is cur»
iciitly revamping the structure ol’tlre
Hall Council, Finally, many oi‘ you
asked what we are doitig to airswei
the space needs of iiiulti-eiillrtral
groups, coiririrunrly set vice groups.
atttl other \ltltlcttl orgaiii'xatitins on
our campus The SGA Vice-Pr
dent and I ate meeting with the Col-
lege Trustees next week to make a
presentation about expanding the
Forum to meet those needs. Further.
the Trustees have agreed to our r-
quest that they meet with students
other than SGA ol‘l’rcers during their
tipcoiiiing vtsit.

I would like to conclude by encour-
aging you to consider running for
next year's Cabinet positions. The
Prestdcnt and Viccrl’tesident clocr
lions are in March, and tlreso two
ofﬁcers their select the other Cabir
not members. The Cabinet sets the
tone for SGA by determining the
function and role ofllte Joint Board.
chairing a variety ot'cornniitlee and
working with the administration on
a daily basis. To ensure that our camr
pits continues to have a forum to ad-
dress concerns. it is iirrpot-tant that
qualiﬁed candidates run Tor ofﬁce.
and that all ot‘us vote for whom we
feel will best represent us. it you
have airy questions about the Cabl—
iiet positions or airy other aspect of
SGA, please stop by our- oince area
or crn'ail [SGA]. Further, please con-
trrttte to share your thoughts and
ideas with tis throughout the Settles~

We strongly encourage the
adiirinistration to uphold the revocar

this campus despite the change iii
lVCF's policy. We believe the
lVCl“ rcvisctl policy continues to
violate tht: nondiscrimination policy

lion and denial of identity is 1“le
tecl conflict with the tiou-dis’crrnlt»
nation policy ortltrs school because
it discriminates against GLBT per-
sons oii the basis ol’ their sexual ori-
eiitatioir. We strongly encourage the
administration to stand ﬁrm on its
refusal to allow institutional support
for any organicaiiori that strives to
oppress GLBT persons on the basis
of their sexual orientation. We recr
ogtiize that iltSlilullOndliLCd (“SCHmir
