SA'ITDMSICNEWIAOC

We’re Incensed!

We, Students AgainstThings That
Don’t Make Sense In‘CoIlege
Newspapers Especially When It‘s
At Our College
(SATTDMSICNEWIAOC), after
four years at this fine institution,
feel that it is time for our voices to
be heard. We are infuriated and en»
raged about the contents of page 4
of the April 11 issue of the 53:13.
Our fury began with the anti-mari-
juana gorilla ad. WHAT THE
HELL? This big ape is gripping a
small. fragile, human child!
Doesn’t this worry anyone else‘.7
What are the advertisement people
smoking, that they would endanger
a human by placing it in the arms
ofa gorilla? Is saving one hippie's
life really worth the life of this in-
nocent babe? The drug—addled ad
execs obviously think so. The veg-
etation all around the subjects of
the ad brings to mind the horrible
possibilities of poison ivy, poison
oak, gonorrhea, poison elm, poison
sumac, hemlock, juniper, poison
tulips, as well as the plant that the
advertisement itself names most
dangerous: marijuana. Maybe the
gorilla wouldn’t expose her young
to these dangers, but the human
creators of the ad sure did.

As our eyes move down, from
photo to Caption. we read: “If he
Were her child...” If he were her
child he wouldn‘t be on page 4 0f
the Grinnell College weekly! He’d
be on the front page of every ma-
jor newspaper and news magazine
in the country! Not this week’s, but
next week’s, for currently the front

'pages are dominated by the

Heaven’s Gate intergalactic victims
ization, Or... was this ad actually

intended as an illustration to ac-
cbmpany Sierra Soleil's poignant
analysis directly to the left? After
all, the infant pictured does look a
bit, Shall we say, alien, and the
gorillas passivity indicates that she
herself may be trapped in the mes-
merizing magnetism of the passing
comet. But if (as the caption con-
tinues) “we humans are the smart-
est animal on Earth." then couldn't
we at least strive for some degree
of grammatical accuracy? We are
appalled. '

We were finally ableto track
down the father of the supposedly
human child. Unfortunately his
only comment was, “Have cock
ring. Will travel." In a separate
interview, Jane Goodall exclaimed,
“There‘s no way I would put my
gorillas in that situation!"

Now, with the reader’s permis-
sion, we turn in anger to the previ-
ously mentioned article on the
tragic, shocking, and frightening
Hale-Bopp shocking and frighten-
ing tragedy. We are shocked,
frightened, and victimized by the
degree of media-seclusion in which
Sierra Soleil seems to be living.
Page 33 of this'week's Newsweek
shows aphoto ofa goat holding the
infant “Do” with the Caption, “If he
were her child, she Wouldn’t have
let him wear NikeSI"

This is infuriating. For Soleil to
say the “Media hounds failed to
feast“ [Editor’s Note; The choice
of headline for this particular are
ticle was that of the editor] On the
Heaven‘s Gate-Nike Sportswear In,
terstellar Racing Team iS as ludie
crous as saying there is no

Gate shockingly tragic incedent
was the cover story in Time,
Newsweek, U.S. News 8: World
Report, Elle, Fangoria. Iuggs,
Good Housekeeping (the gardening
article, by the Way, was particularly
insightful this month), Teen Beat,
Modern Bride, and RC. Modeler
(in which We read how to build our
own battery-powered comet)? For

, all the major media outlets this

month, Norris 4th isn’t what’s for
dinner—its this Cult! Newsweek
editor Maynard Parker Was even
overheard to exclaim, “It‘s like
there's a party in my mouth, and
everyone’s invited!”

My god. Sensationalism llke this
turns our collective stomach. We
are forced to wonder who we would
have to sleep with' before Soleil
would notice this obsessive
commodification of such a shock-
ing tragedy. Or perhaps Soleil is
actually aware of the ridiculous
hype the Heavengs Gate story has
generated, and the columnist’s
heartwrenching and shocking col—
umn, through feigned ignorance, is
a sly attempt to hop on the media
bandwagon, thereby increasing
S&B sales. If this is the case, Mr.
Soleil (IF THAT IS YOUR REAL
NAME!) we applaud you with all
our eight hands. Yes. Excellent.
This MUST be true. ‘We are no
longer incensed. We are at peace.
We are as happy as a babe in the
hairy arms of its mother.

We love you all,

OPINION
- Both Sides:

This week with Dave Rudel

Grinnell takes pride in its docV
trine of selfegovernance.
Prospectives come away from
Grinnell with the impression that
Grinnell is truly unique (pardon
the modified absolute), an impres-
sion I am sure they would still re»
ceive without the events that just
happch to occur around “Speckie”
weekends (cg. Carpe Scrotum).

However, I think that We should
all be asking ourselves (even if
only over our 3 dollar bowls of
cereal In at quad)‘ if self-gover-
nance has made Grinnell a better,
rather than simply “unique," instie
tutlon. [charge that, in all actualr
ity, Grinnell is a perfect example
of self-governance gone awry.

The basic tenet of self»gover-
nance, I am an adult, and I don’t
need anyone telling me what to do,

has as its tacit assumption that the'

“adults” in question have a modi-
cum of respect, a grain of objec-
tivity, and a shred of integrity.
While many on campus do fit in
at least one of these categories, the
evidence says that We have not
reached critical mass yet.

The most direct of this evidence
is simply the connotation most
people afﬁx to “self-governance."

Instead of Seeing this notion as a '

responsibility to do what Should be
done, many students See it as an
opportunity to do as they please.
Self-governance should mean that
we have the freedom to fashion
our living code in a manner cons
sistent with and contributing to the
educational goals expected of any

.one wishing to attend a top-tier

liberal arts college. At Grinnell,

. self-governance means that I get

to take responsibility for others‘
problems: I get to pay for the win-
dow some freshman broke while

under the effects of irresponsible
drinking; I get to be punished be-
cause someone else got addicted
to nicotine; I get to be punished
because someone else considers
spending his college years getting
drunk and/or wasted is his idea of

The basic-tenet of
self—governance, I
am an adult, and
I don’t need any-
one telling me
what to do, has a
tacit assumption
that the “adults”
in question have a
modicum of re—
spect, a grain of
objectivity, and a
shred of integrity.

 

a good time.

The truly farcical thing about the
whole system is that itis reallyjust
a convenience for administrators.
I am Sure that Pam Ferguson
would love to make more public
buildings non-smoking, but, oops,
that goes against self-governance.
I am sure that Steve Larson, direc-
tor of housing. would love to
make some dorms alcohol free,
but: oops, that would go against
selfvgovernance. I bet the idea of

Let’s shatter
our Holy
Grail .

a house devoted to the creation of
a smoke-free, alcohol-free, low«
noise environment was at the top
of everyone's wish list, but two
thirds of the housing committee
was made up of students who evi-
dently did not feel the same way.

_ That's self-governance for you.

Don’t get fooled. The adminis-
tration would not actually give us
any real power. I bet a massive
majority of Students would like to
see board be non-mandatory, but
see how long it takes for Dave M.
to come down from on high and
smite us with chili lentil orzo
should someone ever try to get
such policy passed. Yes, they say
that Dining Services would not be
able to exist without mandating
board, but sel'Ieral restaurants in
town serve better food for less, and
they seem to be doing fine with:

' out a captive audience. Not only

that, but if you look at a menu at
one of them, you can be relatively
Sure that théy will actually have
what they say they have. In addi-

'tion, if they don’t have any food

left when'you get there, you can
leave without having paid any;
thing: imagine that. Can youjust
picture people approaching Travis
(some call him Ben) at quad and
asking for their money back be-
cause quad ran out of (Chicken
Kiev/ pizza/ croissants)! Kind of
boggles the mind just to think
about it. '

In conclusion, self-governance is
a wonderful concept, but it is det-
rimental when enacted in a place
where respect is not common, and
one need only point to the recent
signs authored by the pseduo-
groupsGASP and GASPP (and to
a lesser extent INHALE) to show
proof of this deﬁciency.
