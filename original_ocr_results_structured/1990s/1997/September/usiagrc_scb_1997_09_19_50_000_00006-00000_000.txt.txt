“It‘s always nice to get that first
victory under the belt." said elated
Coach Greg Wallace, after an over-
whelming 43-0 road win against
Principia last Saturday. Now the Pio-
neers are preparing for their ﬁrst con-
ference battle against Beloit here this
Saturday at 1'30.

At Principia the gridders domi-
nated their opponent from stan to ﬁn-
ish. On their first drive the Pioneers
used 11 plays to march 68 yards to a
touchdown. Quarterback Troy
Dougherty ‘00 convened the score
on a one-yard keeper and Nate
Solmosc ‘00 added the extra point.

After an impressive defensive
stand, the Grinnellians racked up a
75-yard drive for its second score,
Dougherty connected with Richard
Werner ‘99 in the end-zone on a pre-
cise 23-yard pass. The extra point
was kicked by Solmose.

At the start of the second quarter
the Pioneer defense joined in the
scoring barrage as defensive back
Jason Kelly ‘00 made an intercep-
tion grab and returned 44 yards for
another Grinnell TD. Solmose once
again converted.

By halftime Daugherty had re-
corded another touchdown on a ﬁve-
yard keeper. After another Solmose
kick the score was 28-0. .

“I was very impressed with the
way that our team handled itself, both
offensively and defensively," re-
marked Wallace. “We set our objec-
tive to stop the run and our defense
did a wonderful job, Anytime you
can hold your opponent to zero
points, you have to be happy."

The Pioneer “D” continued its
shutout play in the second half, and
the offense accumulated 20 more
points en route to a lopsided victory
and a 1-1 record. Dougherty again
found chler on two-yard and 74-
yard touchdown strikes, and first-
year quarterback Joel Cladouhos
hooked up with first~ycar receiver
Matt Roberts ‘01 for his first colle-
giale TD.

”Overall. this was a great day for
us," commented Wallace, “We over-
came penalties and kept drives alive
offensively while the defense hustled
hard and got to the ball all day. This
was an extremely important step for
us to take as we enter into confer-
ence play."

Beloit, which ts presently 0-2, is
a tough competitor from the nonh-
ern division. The game will be a
battle as both teams fight for an im-
portant conference win.

“We cannot overlook this team,“
warned Wallace. “The Buccaneers
will be hungry coming down here
and we will have to stop everything
on defense and control the game of-
fensively. They are a big and funda-
mentally sound team and we will
need to focus on stopping their rush."

“we don’t know much about St.
John's and Simpson but I expect
them to be competitive games. St.
John‘s is from a very tough soccer
conference while some ofSimpson's
scores this fall suggest they are
strong,” noted Coach John Pfitsch.

Last week the Pioneers hosted
Knox in its home and Midwest Con-
ference opener. The kickers got on
track With an early goal from John
Palinski ‘01. At the eight-minute
mark he took a pass from Zach
Goldman ‘98 and knocked home a
15-yarder from the right side of the
box. The Pioneers held the 1-01e21d

“Our first half against Knox was
the best we’ve played all year," said
Pﬁtsch, “We passed the ball very
well and our defense was strong."
Coach Pfitsch called rookie Joel
Felkey ‘01 a stronghold on the de-
fensive line. Pfitsch also noted the
improved play ofsenior captain Seth

were outmatehed by an impressive
St. Thomas team. The Tommies
were led by Kelly Hudson, who net-
ted a remarkable four of their six
goals. She owns eight ofher team's
11 goals this season, ‘

“Unfortunately, we were not able
to contain the athleticism of Hudson
and her team is well-trained to get
her the ball at the right time," com-
mented Wood. “However, some
times the score does not really indi-
cate the complexion of the game.
Although we were not able to win

ecuted some things very nicely."

After going down 2-0, senior
Sally Goodspeed drilled a 40-yard

St, Thomas answered soon after and
then Grinnell got another goal from
sophomore Fran Lee.

“I have never felt more upbeat

The first Midwest Conference
opponent of the season awaits the
Grinnell College women ’s volleyball
team. In their only match of the
week, the Pioneers travel to
Monmouth on Saturday.

Last season the Pioneers notched
one of their two league wins against
Monmouth so first-year coach Tom
Sonnichsen is optimistic about Sat-
urday. “We have a lot of practice
time to improve in some areas this
week. I think we’re a pretty good
team in a one—match situation." com-
mented Sonnichsen.

By winning three offive matches
last week the spikers continued their
winning ways, pushing their overall
record to 7-3. “I’m encouraged by
what we‘ve done," noted
Sonnichsen.

Wednesday in their home opener
the netwomen rallied to win the
fourth and fifth games to defeat
Upper Iowa, 32. “That was a qual-
ity win because Upper Iowa did not
give the match away. We earned
every point," noted the coach.

Last Saturday the Pioneers played
at the Augustana Invite where they
finished fourth. The spikers won
their pool by defeating of Carthage,
3-1, and Eureka, 3-1. In the cham-
pionship round Webster. 2 team
Grinnell beat earlier in the year. pre-
vailed in a close match, 3-2. Eureka
then fought back to claim third place
with at 3-0 win. ~

“Our ﬁrst win against Eureka was
great. They are a very big, physical
team. The second time we played
them we played our second team.
I‘m pretty pleased with the resulLs of
that second match. too, because the
games were very close." commented
Sonnichsen.

Outside hitter Jamie Snider ‘00
won praise from the coach. She was
one ofthree players who were named
all-tournament. According to
Sonnichsen, setter Amber Donahue
‘00 is learning how to control a
match. She posted 188 assists for the
week and is also the team’s top scorer
from the serving position.

Over the week Grinnell produced
570 digs, 115 a match. which
Sonnichsen says is outstanding.
“Amber, Jamie and Courtney Sapp
are showing great hustle while our
middle hitters, Susie Przybylinski
and Sacha Steenhoek. have been
playing steady." Sonnichsen said.

“We have some work to do this
week. Our coun positioning must
improve and we need to learn how
to score more on the serve. I think
we‘ll also put in more offensive
plays," ﬁnalized Sonnichsen,
