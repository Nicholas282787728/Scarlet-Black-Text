to “work all

Hincs.

"[Tlic troupe] IS like the food you

The idea behind impiovlsational
comedy comes historically from

Ritalin Test Squad aimed to amuse

gallons. but instead would wait in the
pulpit [or divine inspiration to reach
dowti from heaven and move them
into a furor ol' hellﬁre and damna-
tion.

“The imprcv troupe works witii a
similar concept. except we don‘t run
the risk of anyone taking us SCl’lr
ously," said Hines.

Usually, u periormunee will cone

tant for the audience to know what
we do is completely spontaneous
because it increases our chances of
being forgiven.”

One particular game the troupe
plays in performance is called
“Mixed Media."The troupe puts on
a skit that combines elements of
shows, books. and movies suggested

by the audience. The audience rs
asked leOl down phrases on pieces
of paper and put them in a hat or
some such container Thcn, mem-
bers ot the troupe grab a paper and
try to work whatever is written on it
into their skit.

Because they do rcly so much on
audience participation, “games will
be different COillCnt-Wlse, but as far
as structure goes, we do work offtlie
same basic patterns," explained
Hines,

Sometimes the troupe will do an
open unpmv in which the single idea
ts to keep it Story gomg as long as
possible.

“It is inevitable," said Hines, "that
some elements like sheepjokes wtll
creep into everything we do. But this
isn’t to be seen as a matter of pie
planning, but Scottish national
pride...though usually [the storyljust
degrades inio cheap jokes and scxual
references,"

According to Hines, some plans
are in the works for a few possible
improv workshops in town, but the
troupe was basically created by and
for students.

“We’d be open to performing else—
where, but it's deﬁnitely not a for
proﬁt organization. However, contri
butions will be accepted at box 057
03 and will be duly delivered to the
Princess Di Memorial Fund in order
to...hire hitmen for the paparazzi.”

The troupe accepts new members
after every show, and, unlike years
post, no audiiions are required.

“Practices are on Fridays and Sale
ut'days,“ said Hines, “our patron god-

dess is the improv frog, and libation
services are held every Friday of a
full moon, but no sheep are sacriﬁced
(or at least not very many) and it’s
not like we're naked or anything."

Since l957

help. There is a guy played by Bill
Pullman who is married to a lady
played by PatriciaArquette, and they
live really weird and empty lives in
the suburbs. One day they get this
video tape, things happen, and the
next thing you know, Bill Pullman
is in prison for killing his wife,
which we apparently don’t see and I
can’t really tell you that he did it,
Then things get so damn weird 1am
not going to even bother trying to tell
you about them, because I Will take
great pleasure in being in the theater
listening to all of you yell at the
screen, “What the HELL?”

Ican'i think of anything about this
movie that I did not like. Actually,l
did not like watching it practically
alone at 2 AM. because when you
couple an ambient soundtrack pro-
duced by Treat Reznor and the dark
imagery from the depths of Lynch’s
subconscious, you get something
that will spook you out. , Take a
friend whose arm you can grab hold
of when Robert Blake‘s scary old
man shows up. Practice saying be-
fore you go, “What the hell? What
the hell is going on? Could some-
one tell me why thatjusthappened?"
I became used to saying that about
every ﬁve minutes, and the best thing
is, no one answered my questions,
and nothing ever will Lynch is ex—
tremely sadistic, and I think he also
takes pleasure in knowing his audi-
ence walks out of the theater feeling
all gooey inside, muttering to the
wind, “What the hell?"

The cast of actors in this is huge:
Robert Loggia, Balthazar Getty, Rie
chard Pryor, Gary Busey, and even
Henry Rollins. All oflhese folks do
2i good Job of keeping up the
confusement, but the cloud clears for
one briefscene in which you will see
Robert Loggia as Mr. Eddie acting
out exactly what will happen to tail»
gaters in a world ruled by me. This
scene was about ten times as funny
as anything in Everyone Says lLove
You.

Another thing which some ofyou
may want to know about is, this thing
has a lot of sex (six scenes, two in
slow motion, not that I’m counting).
It seems almost absurd after a while.
At one point, the movie makes fun
of itself, watch for it.

With great acting, music, cinema-
tography, and anything else I have
forgotten that I loved, this movie res
ceives the prestigious four out of a
possible four scary old men (Robert

Bake will scare you, trust me). Go
seen, and bring someone who knows
how to say “what the hell" in a lan-
guage other than English. Itcould be
fun.

Everyone Says I Love You

Why? imean, L031 Highway left
me with a lot of questions unan-
swered, but the only one on my mind
after] suffered through this garbage
was, “Why is it going to be in Hare
ris, and whose idea was it?” I don't
care what you say, I hate Woody
Allen as an actor,just barely respect
him as a writer, and I sure as HELL
do not want to hear him sing! In case
you haven‘t heard, this thing is a mus
sical comedy, I spent the ﬁrst ten
minutes trying to ﬁgure that out, and
praying to the Film Gods that it was
all a horrible printing mistake or
something. But no, I watched all on»

, bearablc;95-minutes of this driyel,so

I could bring this message to you:,“lf
you go see this, you are going to eir
ther leave in the ﬁrst musical piece
or leave the contents of your stomr
ach on the ﬂoor."

There is a huge cast of actors, al-
most all of whom I reeogniied, and
some of whom I actually respect.
You get to see Alan Alda. Drew
Barrymore. Lucas Haas, Goldie
Hawn, Gaby Hoffman, Natasha
Lyonne, Edward Norton, Natalie
Portman, Julia Roberts, Tim Roth,
David Ogden Sticrs, and of course
Woody Allen all in one ﬁlm. Nor»
mally, that alone would be wonh the
price of admission, but then they go
and ruin everything by smging, and
not very well. The songs are pretty
mediocre, and nothing will leave you
humming as you walk out, I’m still
guessing a large number of you will
walk out rciching.

Major problems in this film iris
elude: 1. Drew Barrymore’s nipples
steal the stage right out from under
Tim Roth's muSical number, which
is sad, because i liked his singing.
2. Woody Allen seems infectious and
all the actors slip into his odd ges-
tures throughout the film I hope they
seek help for that, otherwise they are
going to put out someonc’s eye in
their next role. I Can’t waste anymore
time on this one folks. I rather ten-
tatively give it one and a half gratu—
itous ﬂying Goldie Hawns lam not
even kidding on this one, Come in
for the last ﬁfteen minutes to see that
if you want a good laugh at the ex—
pense of a bad movie.
