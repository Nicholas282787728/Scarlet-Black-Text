OPINION

Why I Don’t Like Ani DiFranco

BY TEQUIA BURT
Opinion Editor

I have never felt come
pletely charmed by punk/
folk singer Ani Difranco
much to the chagrin of
many of my friends. I tried
once to embrace her, my
freshman year. the year Ani
performed at Grinnell. the
year Ani mania took hold of
the campus. But, alas, I
couldn’t shake that nagging
irritation I felt whenever I
heard her voice. I have al—
ways been troubled by this
and until recently I could
not explain or pinpoint the
source of my discomfort
with one of the few modern
women singers Grinnellians
equate with goddess.

Why didn’t I like Ani?
When I told people I didn’t
really enjoy her music all
that much, all I received
were quizzical stares, What?
You.7 Aren’t you a feminist?

Suddenly it hit me.

I had an amazing insight
while sitting on the toilet in
the women’s bathroom in
the basement of Burling li-
brary this summer, So, I’m
sitting on the toilet looking
around, reading all the con-
tributions made by Grinnell
women on the bathroom
wall. I look to my right and

. there are lyrics to an Ani
song. That’s it, I thought.
That’s why I don 't like Anil

These were the lyrics on

the bathroom wall:
lam nota preltygirl. That

is not what I do. [ain’t no
damsel in distress and I
don ’t need to be rescued so
put me down punk.I

I like music I connect to.
This connection can be
small or great, but I need to
feel something come alive in
my soul when I listen. Not
only do I not feel connected
to Ani. but I feel slightly
opposed to the ideologies to
which she subscribes in her
music.

No. this does not mean I
am antiewnman and it does
not mean that I disagree
with the actual lyrics of
Ani‘s music. I am very pro—
woman and I am down with
all politics that embrace
equality. What I personally
object to in Ani‘s music is
the fact that I think she is
speaking to a certain audie
ence from which I feel ex,
cluded.

[am not a prettygirl. That
is not what I do. This coun—
try holds a very Eurocentric
ideal of beauty close to its
heart. Black women have
not traditionally been seen
as conventionally pretty in
the larger American society.
Exotic, sure. but definitely
not pretty. Black women
have been gaped at because
of their “strange appear-
ances", as was the “Venus of
Hottentot” (meaning an
apron like vagina) in France
during the 18005. This
woman was exported from
Africa to be placed on dis-
play because of her “unusu-

ally savage” sexual parts.
"just recently a friend of
mine was browsing the
shelves of a local antique
shop when she came across
a cartoonish ashtray. It was
a caricatured ashtray of a
black woman with thick lips.
a ring stuck in her mouth,
and a bone in her wild hair.
Imagine Mammy plus “wild
African savage” rolled all
into one. Shocked. she
bought it just to get it off the
shelves. It was one of the
moSt offensive images I have
ever personally seen of a
black woman. But still it ex—
ists. Only those black
women closer to the stan-
dard of "white" beauty have
been thought of as pretty.
I ain ’t no damsel in distress
and I don ’t need to be rese
cued soputme down punk!
Black women are also not
usually thought of as the
“damsels in distress". They
were not included in that
whole cult of domesticity
thing. This is not to say that
blacks of higher classes did
not espouse that whole
”women have to stay at
home” bit, But this was usu-
ally done in an effort to in-
tegrate into the larger white
society. Black women have
historically had to find a job
in order to support theme
selves and their families. it
was never much of an issue
whether or not they should
work. Maybe they didn’t
want to work and maybe
they even thought they

Don’ tAsk Me, I’ m Just A Girl

Now that I have become a
superstar and cultural icon of
sorts. people just won‘t leave
me alone. The phone calls,
the letters. the flowers... Re»
ally, thank you but I do need
some space, To solve this
problem and so I can have
some time to myself, I’ve de—
cided to publish answers to
some of the most common
questions I get asked.

Lizz. why are you so cynical?
Well. that’s an answer with
many and diverse parts. First
of all. my roommate never
‘ makes me coffee in the morn»
ing. That’s a big one. Its es
pecially important on morne
ings the loop scoopers have
kept me up all night with
their drageracing. Secondly.
my vast intellect has cursed
me with inability to just see
things for face value, My
friend in high school once
told me I could find some
thing wrong with a sunset.
Duh. its caused by air pollu—

tion. Third of all Ive stud
ied the masters. Matt
Groenig, The Onion. those
guys in the balcony during
The Muppet Show. Craig
Kilbour, Daria Morgane
dorfer. and many others
have helped me realize my
potential as a cynic. Fourth,
Iwas born in 1977. the tail
end of Generation X. Their
cynical and jaded outlook
on life really made me ques
tion my personal happiness.
Finally, and possibly most
important of all. its fun to
find fault in others and in
society.

Lizz, how have you handled
your newfound fame?

I have to admit. its been
tough. The people recognir
ing me on the street and
when I’m passed out in a
ditch somewhere is kind of
strange. I mean. they rec-
ognize me even without my
makeup onl I’ve been tryv
ing to stay away from the
whole Hollywood scene- the
parties. the drugs. the rock
stars that are always trying
to date me... Getting away
from the press has been a
bitch. Fortunately. I’ve
found a support group
founded by Madonna that
helps a rising star like my-
self deal with all the new
pressures.

I’ve been trying to use my
fame for good. I’ve recently
started a shelter for struge
gling supermodels. They re»

ally need a place to stay and
a nice warm meal Some of
those girls haven‘t eaten in
months! And they’ve all
been real thankful too.
Sometimes, I’ll get a clipping
from Vogue or Cosmo and
it-‘makes me smile when I
think about how I helped get
them started.

Why doyou spellyour name
with two z's?

Now that’s a very common
question I get asked, It is
rooted in my original name.
Lizzie, Around fourth grade.
I decided that I needed to exA
press my newfound “big
kid” ness by dropping the
last three letters in my
name, It could have been
third grade. now that I think
about it. Anyway. one 2 was
just not enough for me. I
felt off balance, So. when
fifth grade rolled around, I
emerged Lizz.

Lizz. how can I be more like
you?

For starters. I think its im-
portant to eat like me, I like
to eat a lot of health food
and ifl don’t eat my health
food I get very grumpy, Be-
ing grumpy is good if you
are the campus cynic, Next.
make sure to read books like
the Life in Hell series and
watch the Simpsons. Daria,
and Full House. [often find
that Dj‘s chipper outlook
makes me want break things
and hurt people, Don‘t even

would prefer to be a “house-
wife", but it didn’t change
the fact that they would
starve if they didn’t go out
and ﬁnd work, In fact, those
Rosie the Riveter posters
some of you have on your
walls should actually have
pictures of black women or
very different looking
women who had Italian ac-
cents. Maybe this image of
“the strong black woman” is
problematic (because it
leads to other kinds of ex—
ploitation), but it is true that
black women have been
forced, more so than white
women, to earn a living out-
side the home.

It does bother me. how—
ever, that I feel opposed to
the politics that Ani es-
pouses, Why have black and
white women been put at
odds with one another? I
personally believe it’s that
whole divide and conquer
thing, I have come a long
way. though.. I used to hiss
every time the word femie
nist or feminism came up.
But now I realize that it is
important for me to under-
stand the nature of the op-
pression white women have
been subject to. Helping me
to understand this helps me
understand the nature of all
oppressions. Fight the
power, Baby!

So. I personally don’t like
Ani. You can like her, love
her. worship her, but that
doesn’t mean I‘ll love you
any less.

get me started on those little
troll children... Drink large
amounts of coffee. Diet
Coke too. That will make
you edgy and high strung.
Burp a lot. Blame all of your
problems on others and al-
ways act as if you are the vic-
tim, Live with others that
do the same.

Cory. Feldman or Haim?
Definitely Cory Feldman. He
always had an air of mys—
tery. though that was lost
during the whole drug
thing.

When and why did you dee
cide to be a columnist for
the 5&8?

Well, I did a lot of it for the
power. I’d like to think that
this column will eventually
serve as the written word for
my social agenda. And I’ve
been paid in liquor, which
is a ways nice.

Tales From Another World

BY DAVE FRIEDMAN
Columnist

Church. I have been. I
have walked on sacred
grounds. pilgrimaged to
great lengths. I have lis-
tened to the choir. I have
been raised high by song. I
have been humbled by the
power of music. I have
closed my mind to all
thoughts and opened my
whole self to the beauty of
the notes. I have been made
holy.

Where is your church?

Church, synagogue, mos—
que, bedroom, auditorium,
meadow. no difference.
Those are names and we are
dealing with what’s holy.

I have been to a church
where the preacher is drunk
on whiskey and rambles sere
mons in the guise of songs
as the bass player raises the
congregation to its feet with
a thumping groove. It is joy
to be alive there. Life is light
and always moving, chang
ing like the drummer’s beat.
I have been to church with
thousands of others. pil»
grims all of them. all of
them moving to the same
sounds; no two moving in
the same way. Everyone is
free to choose the rhythm
of their motion.

I shake fast and slow and
often out of control. like my
mind moves. I fill with the
whole of what is happening,
and sometimes it rages in
my mind, exploding in the
smallest details, and some—
times it leads me to a still—
ness of thoughts and an ace
ceptance of being. of exist
ing in the one beautiful mo
ment which is as long as I
want it to be, as long as I
stay in the rhythm, as long
as I move with the whole.

There are no words that
can express religion. The
bible’s weakness is its inabile
ity to leave the page. The
Tao Te Ching admits to try
ing to name the unname-
able, to describe the
undescriable. to tell the
truth. But text is only one
person’s idea on a page, no
more than a presentation. It
is beauty recorded but it‘s
worthless to all but the
writer if it doesn’t bring
beauty to the reader. Reli—
gion is understanding. and
people can learn to under-
stand in any situation, not
only when they are on their
knees.

Here. I am writing of joy,
and it is no substitute. This
page is not 'what you need.
Joy is peace and peace is the
goal. It is not to worry, to
know that you are provided
for, that no matter what fate
lies ahead in this life it is still
life and life only. And joy
is yours all the time. you
only need to choose it.

Joy is holy..like the smile

on your face when you find
that you’re in love, are
loved, like the smile on the
Buddha, on the mystic. on
the preacher. on the tripped
out hipster who love for the
feeling it gives them. ‘cuz
they love themselves too,
and to be in a world filled
entirely with love what
other reaction can there be,
what' can you do when you
solve your life‘s riddle but
smile?

Spinning like a dreidel
down a hill, I have spiraled
through lies to the center of
me. Lifted from the moment
to look down on the movie
below. I have been pulled
aside and told my role. Af-
ter that. laid back in the con-
tinuing scene. my mind Was
challenged to make it work.
to make the transition seem
seamless. And in my church
I never fail. I am living as I
should live and I know it.
and I am empty of desire
‘cuz the moment is my world
and I cannot see beyond.
And I don’t want to fail. I
don’t want any moment to
be more beautiful than an-
other. I cannot go to church
one day a week. recite my
prayers and move along.
My church must travel. I
must be in church when I
wake and be in church when
Ilay to sleep. Every moment
must be spent in discover-
ing the holiness of the situe
ation, ‘cuz it is this life that
is holy and not the prayers
we utter.

Ego. yes, I have it. I feel
important. I feel every life
is important. It gives me the
power to live. to know that
every day I affect the earth.
That 1 am alive as the earth
is alive. and as the wind
blows the present changes to
the past. and as I act the fu-
ture is shaped. Ego and hue
mility can exist together,
truth is based on such con-
tradictions. When I stand as
my firmest self, my knees
are bent to the whole of
greater signiﬁcance. I am a
factor in life, but no more
than anything else, animal,
vegetable, mineral. living or
dead, the nineteenth cen-
tury hermit makes my grass
grow and dead Walt
Whitman wrote for dead
Allen Ginsberg. who I write
for now. to keep alive ideas
of freedom and beauty and
the inextinguishable impor—
tance of finding your true
self.
