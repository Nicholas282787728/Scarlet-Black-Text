An editor’s film Stepping up to the challenge

A look at how Grinnell’s young music scene is

praise: Fall ‘97

KURT ORZECK
Arts Editor

Actually, I did see some good mov-
ies this summer, but of course they
were all on video. The ones I did
see in the theatres made me cringe.
basically. Air Force One, Carl Air;
and Contact brought me to my mis-
ery. Why, Harrison, are you picking
off Russians and not recovering the
Lost Ark‘,7 Why are you in a movie
withTreatWiIliams,SteveBuscemi?
And why, Jodie Foster. are you hav-
ing boring conversations with your
father in outer space when you could
be studying the alien surroundings?

One ﬁlm did redeem me, though.
Ulee Lt Gold with Peter Fonda proved
to be the most compelte and round
movie ofthe summer, at least in my
book. That ﬁlm stuck in my head all
summer long. in fact. Fonda put on
a marvelous acting performance and
the bee symbolism scored big points
in my humble, analytical opinion.

And while I saw all these movies.
I wondered what the ﬁlms would
shape up like when I got back to
Grinnell. I remembered the ﬁismy
complaints last year about the SGA
showing too many “art“ films.
Wouldn‘t want that now, would we'.7
Those silly independent
moviemakers, foolishly weaving
depth into their plots.

Obviously, I was afraid. Afraid that
I‘d come back to a ﬁuourescent fall
ﬁlms card that would boast Men in
Black and The Lost World among
other blockbusters coming to cam»
pus.

But, happily. that did not happen.
Instead ofbeing horriﬁed by the card,
I became relieved and then excited
the further down the list I went. Not
only did I see indie films galore be
fore my eyes, they were all ones I
hadn’t seen before,

So, in order for me to convey this
overwhelming feeling of cinematic
exuberation and the consequent out-
pouring of adoration for SGA, I‘ll
give you a rundown on the list of
ﬁlms:

- Crash should gain the most
attention here on campus. Banned
in England, this ﬁlm’s media claim
to fame is its N017 rating. Butwith
James Spader and Holly Hunter, it
should be worth at least some ofthe
hoopla it’s attracted.

- Lost Highway comes in a close
second and might achieve the best
attendence record. David Lynch
made this one, Remember that
creepy, eerie TV series Twin Peaks?
Same scary dude.

» Kolya I saw the other day when
it played here as one ofthe Cultural
Films. It won the Oscar for Best
Foreign Film last year, and I suppose
it deserves the honor. It's a striking
picture about maverick Yugoslavian
male who takes in a small Russian
boy due to tricky circumstances. The

two grow togethcrand form zt
believeztble, heartwarming ICIaIlOnr
ship. The acting, plot and mood are
all great; don’t forget about Katya
when it comes around later this Scpe
tember

- The Celluloid Closet is a docu-
mentary»type ﬁlm about how Holly-
wood has dealt with homosexuality,
The ﬁlm takes an invdepth View on
how actors perceive how Hollywood
has handled the issue.

- Kika, a Spanish movie about a
hairdresser. proves to be one of the
more bizarre films on the list. And
if you haven’t had your dose of Fe
ter Coyote for the year, he‘s in it, too.

- The Pillow Book stars Ewan
McGregor in a ﬁlm about a woman
obsessed with tattooing her body.
Can’t tell ya much more than that.

» Safe, Love, Valor, Compassion
and The Daytrippers and are all sup—
posed to be excellent, though Idon't
know enough about them to tell you
anything substantial.

I realize I‘m probably not too
elaborative on many of these mov-
ies, but that‘s exactly what I'm happy
about. There’s nothing better than
seeing a movie you know nothing
about, but leave the theater realizing
that that was one damn good movie.
That happened to me just the other
night, in fact, with Walking and Talk-
ing. And the good thing about see-
ing movies the SGA picks is that
even if you are chancing it, nine
times out of ten it was worth taking
the risk.

I'd also like to mention the other
movie outlets this campus has to of;
fer, in case you are unaware of them.
Somethingthat awes me every time
I realize it is that Grinnell shows at
least ﬁve movies zl week.

Besides seeing flicks at Harris, you
can check them out in ARH Friday
through Sunday. The Cultural Film
series runs a new ﬁlm every week,
These are a bit more risky. but can
often be worth the watch.

And, to my surprise, Tuesday Night
Movie Madness has been resucilaled
by Gregg Lind '99. They showed
Taxi Driver the other night, and. if
they choose to follow in the path of
MUTT, will be showing a lot of cool
cult movies this semester.

And then there's town. Yeah, that
possibility ’s also there too. I suppose.
If you happen to have the desire to
see a big name movie with a two—
month tardy slip, you can check out
the theater in town last week.

Non'nally, I’d use the rest of this
space to beg SGA for all the other
ﬁlms they should get this year. Probe
lem is, not that many other good ones
seemed to pass through this summer,
save Ulee’s Gold. So congrats, SGA.
on another great lineup. And don‘t
forget to keep avoiding those “art"
ﬁlms.

tions.

Baggs worked with Jacobs to print
the CD, which Baggs is now distrib-
uting to independent record labels.
If the band were to connect with a
label, bassistNeil Gipson ‘00claims
the band would be ready for it.
“Most of us can realize that itprob-
ably wouldn’t happen," Gipson said.
though the band agreed to set aside
time to tour should the occasion
arise.

Weasel 7 plans to play as early as
late October. when Baggs and gui-
tarist Andy Nassiff ‘97 return to
Grinnell. Gipson believes Baggs
and Nassiff will return for a num-
ber of performances.

“I fought tooth and nail not to be
a ska band," commented Gipson.
Gipson, who likes funk, said that

, all have a love of music,“

though Weasel 7 plays a few ska
songs, “the rest is pretty much anti-
ska."

Most bands interviewed indicated
trouble at their initial outsets. “We
said
McGinty. “it’sjust really hard to get
it all together and sit down and write
songs that was our problem for
awhile." Redmond said, “If we
didn't live in Main, it‘d be hard," in
regards to practicing. explaining that
the mobilization process to practice
took three hours.

The Grinnell music has undergone
radical transition over the past few
semesters. Attention has turned
from guitar-powered, improvisa-

-tional music to a tighter sound with

varied instruments. Trumpets and
Saxophones are becoming the norm.
Ryan, however, contended that the
music scene is nevertheless "one~di~
mensional."

Next Saturday, a concert is sched-
uled to feature Perch Ass, Speed of
Sauce, God’s Reﬂex, and the Holy
Infants. God's Reﬂex, a Chicago-
based band, includes Goudreau,
while the Holy Infants, also a non»
campus band, includes Ryan. The
concert is the ﬁrst concert this se-
mester with more than one campus

With the groupie-ﬁlled, jamming

away, new bands are struggling for
a piece of the prize. What to expect
from this semester‘s output? Black
and white checkerboard replacing
hippie apparel. tight playing as op—
posed to free-ﬂowing, lengthy gui-
tar solos. and, though it need not be
said, many crazed fans.
