Tales From Another World

BY DAVE FRIEDMAN
Columnist

It was his ﬁrst night alone. He was
thirteen. When they left he watched
them walk to the driveway. He stood
by the window drawing the curtain
with his hand as they backed out and
drove away, He stood and listened
as the rumbling sound of the aging
car faded into the distance, He stood
by the window for ten minutes till
he was sure they weren‘t coming
back, then he cautiously moved to the
chair. He felt their eyes on him still
as he sat in the tall brown chair, his
father's chair. He reclined.

It was his ﬁrst night alone, “and I‘ve
been alive so long," he thought. Oh,
how he had dreamt of this night.
Night and day, imagining scenarios,
it would be his ﬁrst kiss, his ﬁrsttime
drunk, his ﬁrst time stoned, his ﬁrst
time free, withoutjudgment, “I will
do what] want.” he told himself, and
so in the living room, darkening, he
put his feet up and reclined as far as
the chair would take him and he
smiled beautifully into space.

He sat like this for quite awhile,
until the telephone rang and his
trance was broken. He thought it
might have been hours. He had been

trying to calm down. He was trying
to slow the pace of his life to the pace
he wanted, He was nearly there
when the phone interrupted. It was
hrs parents calling from a gas station.
Though he had done nothing wrong
he began to feel guilty, as though he
shouldn’t have been trying to live dif-
ferently. As if even though his par-
ents were not present he still had to
live inaccordance with theirpercep-
tions ofhim. As ifhc had been wrong
for seekirig his own pace. “Hello
dear," his mother said. “You‘re not
coming back? ...are you?" he blurted
out. “No. We just left the direcA
tions..." “Where are they?" he inter-

rupted, “I’ll go get them."They were >

right where his mother thought they
would be and he got them on their
way. but he still didn’t feel quite
right. “Do you feel OK Charlie?"
she'd asked, and he had hardly an
swered, He was alone, and he was
awfully pleased to be alone, but it
was not what he expected. He could
do what he wanted, but he didn‘t
know what he could do, His mind
was full of the things he knew he
shouldn't do, what he‘d always been
told not to do.

Welcome Freshman. Welcome ev»
eryone else. Welcome to Grinnell in
all of its splendor, Try not lo cat the
food and keep out ofBurling for as
long as possible. I trust you all had
wonderful summers. Its hard not to
have a wonderful summer with cone
tinuous radio airplay of bands like
Hanson and the Spice Girls. Of
course, I’m from Milwaukee so I get
to add in classic rock bands like REO
Speedwagon and Supenramp to the
continuous radio airplay Iist,.,

Let‘s discuss the events ofthe su -
mer. TheMarsthipg. That'waski d
of neat. However, I kept finding-
myselfwtshlng that the landing hapn
pened when I was younger and cared.
Updates of the Jean Benet Ramsey
trial, now that's entertainment.
Speaking offreaky pageant chicks, I
found out that Miss Teen Wisconsin
1997 went to my old high school,
She didn’t win, Miss Tennessee did.
Chelsea Clinton is going to Stanford
in September. Iwent to Stanford for
two weeks over Spring Break last
year. It sucked. I wouldn‘t go there

if I was promised straight A's (on top
of their grade inﬂation policies) and
a hot date with Fred Savage (appar-
ently he's a frat boy at SAE). The
new season of the Real World we
miered in July. It seems okay, I give
it a second to the London episodes,
Montana is my favorite. I really
don't like the Texas girl, she reminds
me of all the bad qualities in all of
my friends irom home all wrapped
into one, That disgruntled altemaboy
from C0 is a pail comparison to my
favorite rocker, Neil (he was the
blonde guy in leather pants who got
his tongue bit off). Rumor! I read in
Teen (July issue) that Syrus gets
kicked out of the apartment. I do
have ‘to say that my favorite new
show of the summer has to be Daria
, I love Daria on so many levels. I
even got my mom to watch the show.
Seeing that the ﬁrst weeks ofschool
compare to only graduation weekend
in the quantity of “found loves," (ri-
valed only to waltz, disco, and ran-
dom party weekends) I took the lib»
erty of making a few personal ads to
spark interest among the campus.

heard and believed, just as when he
was ﬁve he believed thatonly the had
kids said no to their parents. And
besides he had no pot. He knew the
kids who smoked. He knew them
only from class, where they came late
with glossy eyes and sat in the back.
They spoke differently and dressed
differently and talked almost con-
stantly about music and movies and
the planetarium laser show. He
feared them, and he feared pot too.
thinking it would make him like
them, and he wasn't ready to be so
different. He wasn't ready to be so
bad.

He had seen his parents drunk a
number of times - only last week at
his cousin’s wedding his parents had
drank whiskey sweet after whiskey
sweet and he'd never seen them so
happy as on the drive home when
they laughed and joked and smiled
beautifully the whole ride. Yes, he
had decided long ago it would be lie
quor, and he already knew his drink,

Whiskey sweet after whiskey sweet
he reclined back further. Watching
the TV and the way the air seemed
to be moving, ‘Circular’ he thought.
“Tubular” he said aloud, laughing.
One, two, three drinks and it had only
been an hour. His eyes drifted often
from the TV. When they would drift
they would hollow out, leaving them

'empty, no clue to understanding and

he would stare with these eyes into
the wood on the wall, penetrating
deep into the dark mahogany. He
stared so deeply, so intensely that he
made the wood spllnlel. popping
loudly and shooting woodshards dan-
gerously across the room. He sllut
his eyes and raised his hand and
braced for the pain. but none came.
He peeked out from behind his arms
and saw the wall straight and smooth
as it stood before. He didn't know
what to think. He set his drink down
on the table, and looked once more
at the wall and reclined, that same
beautiful smile spreading across his
lips and sparkling in those empty
eyes. A first night alone and a ﬁrst
Vision. He didn’t understand what it
meant, buthe felt different. It was if
the hallucination was the ﬁrst thing
he had seen on his own. and he had
seen it through, seen through the
falseness. He felt more conﬁdent in
his own vision despite having been
betrayed. He felt ﬁne about being
alone, He liked the idea of seeing
things that weren’t there, There were
so many things he wanted that he
could not see, and when he was
alone, no one could tell him they
were not there, the world was as he
saw it. Finally, he thought, It is my
world.

To the editor

Dear 5&5,

Why is Homer angryl Remember,
folks, Homer is a friend to Grinncll
students. But Homer feels the divi-
sion of labor and the exploitation of
the proletariat, Ml, Bums alienates
Homer on a regular basis, exploits
Holner. '

Homer ls no philosopher, rather
he's a poet. He’s accessible to the
average Joe, the average Marge. any
one and everyone Homer actually
works, as oppose to tile Grinncll pron
fessor, the professor that doesn’t
tnind lfhe has to show up for Labor
Day. No one thanks the professors
for teaching on Labor Day. No one
lauds your dedication, because you
can be Homer, too. Would Homer
fall asleep at work on Labor Day??
No. He doesn't go. He spends his
time with his family, his kids, his
raison d'etre,

Why is Homer angry? Every Mon—
day of the year Monty Burns forces
Homerlo work at minimal wage. not
even pausing to remember his name,
not even thanking him for the work
he’s doing. Every Monday except
one, Labor Day. Give Homer a
break.

The HOMER committee

To the Editor of the S&B:

I almost forgot Labor Day,
Sadly, I hadn't thought a bit about
the importance of this country’s la»
bor force last Monday until I left the
Grinnell campus to go to work in
town. Only outside of the college
cnvironmentdtd I, as a student, have
the opportunity to experience Labor
Day and take some time to think
about what the holiday means to me:
both of my employers in town had
closed their businesses in order to
observe what they consider zt very
important holiday

As a student at a well-en-
dowed private college, I did not of-
ten come into personal contact with
lhe labor movement and considered
the fact that classes were in atten-
dance on Labor Day nothing more
than a nuisance. During the tenure
of my internship its an organizer with
the AFL-CIO. however, I came to
realize the neglect the Labor move-
ment iscurrently experiencing in this
country, resulting in sharply declin-
ing ﬁgures tn union membership and
activity. The importance of the us
workforce is undeniable, and many
Grinnell students may not realize the
fact that Labor Day presents a single,
scheduled opportunity to celebrate
the efforts of US laborers yearly, The
fact is, the scheduling of classes at
Grinnell on Labor Day represents a
lhoughtlessness regarding the role of
workers in this country at best. As‘a
progressive institution, Grinnell
should be quick to encourage inter»
est and activity on the pan ofGrinneIl
students in helping to secure the sta-
tus ofLabor Day as a vehicle to team
more about today’s Labor Move-
merit. At present, most Grinnell stu-
dents greet Labor Day with minor
annoyance as a result of closed of—
ﬁces, stores and bars.

It is important that Grinnell
observe Labor Day by canceling
classes just as most other colleges
and universities do. Reverence for
the Labor movement is crucial at this
time. And perhaps it is time for the
whole of the campus educational
community to (dare I say it?) peer
from the academic ivory tower to rec-
ognize those who make things hap-
pen in this country—and show sup—
port for this country's most valuable
asset: its workers.

Sincerely,
Ali Neff '98‘
