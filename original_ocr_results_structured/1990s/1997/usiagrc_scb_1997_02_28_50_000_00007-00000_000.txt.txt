Smoking in the Forum

To the college Coinmuliity:

As sensitive nonsmokers. we have
been following closely the debate
over smoking on campus.

As we see it, the dilcitttna ptctly
much boils down to this: who should
have access to the college's public
facilities',7 The answer lies in
Grinnell’s own nondiscrimination
policy, which may be found in the
prcfacc to tltc Student Handbook:
“The college is committed to provid-
ing all of its students, faculty, staff
and visitors witlt cq'ual access to its
piogrants. events, and facilities "
Tltc College wishes to be “in come
pliancc with Section 504 of the Ron
liabilitalion Act of I97} and the
Americans witli Disabilities Act of
1990." -

The key word in that policy is ac-
cess, Spectilcally, access to public
areas and events The Folum is a
public area because it ltosts concerts,
movies, speakers, Admissions recep-
tions, phoiiathon, Smoked-ICC room
draw, and eveti preschool functions
In addition, it ltas a game room and
facilities open to all students. faculty,
and staff.

Currently, the North Lounge is a
smoking lounge. It has a ventilation
systcnt to filter out the smoke. Un-
fortunately, the ventilator only func»
tions fully when the doors to the
game room are open, tltus exposing
the users of those facnitics to sccr
oitdhand smoke. The Forum Desk
area 15 also tainted by smoke, Nor
does the ventilator take care of the
residue oftltc smoke: the stench and
its chemicals cling to every surface
ofthcluungc However, the Veliillfir
tor is largely irrelevant, for, accordr
mg to the Environmental Protection
Agency, cigarette smoke is a Class

to the EPA, Therefore, tlte loungc'

These and other statistics about so;-

ondhaltd smoke are undoubtedly far
miliar. However, some people on
campus don‘t scent to understand
that some pcople are truly indie sen-
sitive to secondhand smokc than oth-
ers, For these people, secondhand
smoke causes irritation of tltc eyes,
nose, and throat For some, Such as
asthmatics, il prcscnts more serious
barriers.

12.5 million Americans are astlte
matic. and tttaity others have similar
medical conditions. Even exrsmokr
ers have enhanced respiratory scnsr
tivity People may not be awaic of
the prevalence of asthma attd scnSt-
tivtty to smoke because many people
are embarrassed to talk about their
health prohlctns arid weaknesses
Some of us, however, are comfort-
able talkiitg about our disability.

A little bit about asthma: according
to the American Lung Association,
asthma attacks can be triggered by
cigarette smoke, During these air
tacks, passages in the lungs contract
and fill with mucus that causes the
air tubes to narrow, rendering breath-
ing nearly Impossible Some asthma
atlacks are more serious than others.
Many people don't realizc that
asthma can be life-threatening, and
it is exacerbated. by siitoke.

According to the group Action on
Smoking and Health, for itonsmokr
ers, “a cloud oftobacco smoke eon-
tamination constitutes as great a
barrier to access as ﬂights of stairs
present to a disabled person in a
wheelchair." In short, lit the areas it
permeates, secondhand smoke den
nies access to sensitive nonsmokers:
UnderTitle III oftheAmericanS with
Disabilities Act, sensrtive nonsmok-
ers have pursued successful civil ac-
tion and lawsuits against public and
private organizations that denied
them access. The Americans with
Disabilities Act protects people who,
like us, have problems performing
such major life activities as breathe
ing in certain environments
There ltas been a lot oftalk on came
pus recently about “smokers’ rights."
While nonsmokers are protected unr
der the law, smokers are speciﬁcally
excluded. However, our grievance
is against the secondhand Smoke we
are forced to bicatltc, and not against

the smokers themselves, We cannot
emphasize tltisenough. Smokctscan
smoke outside, and then enter the
North Lounge to enjoy the facilities;
asthmatics, however, caniiotjnst take
a deep breath outside aitd then sit
through a movie without breathing
the rcSidue ol' the smoke.

Alternatives to the Ntiith Lotitigedo
exist, Bob's Underground extended
its hours speciﬁcally to accommo-
date smokers. In addition, all but two
of lltc dorm lounges—those iii Read
and Smithiptzrmil smoking. Many
of those louttgcs are thliin a minute
or two walk oftltc Forum All rooms,
cxccpt for those in Read, Smith, and
Haincs Pit. accommodate smokets.
as do many off-campus houses. The
entire outdoors is also available to
Smokers, In Short, upwalds of90%
of this town provides areas accomr
modaling to smokers. We would like
to preserve, in public indoor areas, it
little air to breathe for those of us
sensitive to smoke.

At Wednesday‘s Joint Board meet-
ing, the senators agreed that the north
sun (TV) lounge be designated as the
only Smoking area in the Forum. a
modiﬁcation we find amenable, lltis
small lounge will be renovated so
that it operates on a completely sepa
rate ventilation system front any
other part of the Forum. However,
in the interim, before these modifi-
cations arc made, the Ninth Lounge
remains asmoking lounge. Thus, the
college continues to deny access to
sensitive nonsmokers to this Loitnge
and its activities,

In thc coming weeks, we will be tryr
ing to work within Grittnell's sclll
govcrnance framework to make the
campus aware of the dangers of
brcathing environmental tobacco
smoke. However, it the college com-
munity continues to fail to recognize
our right of access to public areas,
we will ask outside agencies and au-
thorities to intervene.

DISCO Fever!

To the Editors of
the Scarlet attd Black,

Socing how the night of all nights
is rapidly approaching, the Men Who
Stuff Their Crotches would like to
offer a few helpful hints on how to
have a delightful Disco.

--Helpful Hint Number l)It is never
too early to prepare for Disco.
There's nothing worse than picking
clothes from the bottom of the bar»
rel, especially when it comes to
Disco apparel. What‘s even worse,
is when you ﬁnd out that your domi’S
prerDisco party absolutely sucked
compared to others, or you didn‘t
even have one,

”Helpful Hint Number 2) When
choosing clothes it is very easy to
find a pair of pants that ﬂair into a
beautiful bell-shape, but the hard part
is to find a nicely tailored bell-bot-
tom that accentuates your buttocks
and crotch . Particularly, for those

of you sporting a cucumber it is es-
sential that you get the maximum
bulge possible.

--Helpful Hint Number'3) Work on
your strut. It is very important_to
perfect this for Disco night because
without a strut you have virtually no
chance of attracting any suitors,
--Helpful Hint Number 4) While
we’re on the subject of attraction,
buy Brut and lots of it, 'nuff said.

"Helpful Hint Number 5) The Hair.
We recommend investing in a high-
power hair dryer that will allow you
to obtain the perfect wind tunnel
tested hairdo, And, in the interest of
keeping itthat way forthe night, and
perhaps for the rest of your life, we
recommend Aquath,

--Helpful Hint Number 6) If you're
going to Hustle, you need the shoes,
Money,

These are,1n‘lhe opinion oflhc Men
Who Stuff Their Crotches, what we
really need to have learned in kin-
dergarten, For now, we feel that if
you follow these simple guidelines,
then Disco will forever be a night to
remember.

RS. In the interest of safety, if any
of you are participating in post-Disco
activities, We encourage the use of
latex; please do not go al fresco as
the did in the-705 when hedonlsm
reigned without concern for the con-
sequences,

OPINION

Dear Fellow Grinnellians, ’:
Followtng the example of our -~-'
crotch-stufﬁng cohorts, we have choi ,;
sen to submit a (subtle) letter to thc'
S&B to announce the most antici-’
pated post—scsquiccntcnnlal pre
party party of the 1997 Spring Sc
mestcr. Because we do notenjoy the ‘3
convenience ofdorm lounges and the ”"
organizational efforts of Hall Social 1"
Coordinators, we have chosen to pro— ""
vide the off-campus community with "I
an alternative space in which to en
gage in prerDISCO activities. Yes
that's right folks, 1020 5th Avenue "'
(Blue House-the left Side) will host "3
a one-ofvarkind, never-tmberforgot-l I
ten, gotchargroch-On, prerDISCO'ZI“
bash! "‘
Not only will our party feature mu-
sical hits from the 705, 805, and to
day courtesy of the “faslrhands” DJ ,
Jazzy~Lep (one of the “men who
stuff their crotches"), BUT we will,
also entertain a glam-slam fashion
show with prizes awarded to the most "
deserving participant, participantics‘ -
and panicipantrons, including most‘
authentic garb, most visible chest
hair (women encouraged to particie
pate), and also prizes acknowledge
ing women who have most cffeer
tively re-appropriatcd male disco '
power "
In order to provide an abundance-
ofbevcrages unique to the 705 (note:
we have obtained an underground list' '
of John T’s favorite drinks) as well '
as proper decor reﬂecting the disco '7
motif and memorializin g the timeless“
era of polyester and platform shoes“;-
we are requesting cash donations of "
SEX-$100 Send your love and sup— "'
port to s, Walters (14-72) or M,
Motlancnen (0866) ASAP. There‘ '0
will be a prize awarded to the most "
generous contributor. All should feel”
welcome to attend (especially off- '2‘
campus disco ducks). Hope your”
dreams are ﬁllcdwtdt visionsorhuti-‘li
