Silent cinema: Russian style

KEVIN MCGOLDRICK

Freeze Frame. The woman stares
vacantly into the distance, shadows
of ﬁrelightplaying with her hair. as a
telephone stands at arms reach. This
simple expression of emotion is part
of a scene from the silent film, “A
Life ForALife,“ directed by Evgenii
Bauer. This is one of several ﬁlms
thaiwill be showing overthe coining
month as part of the Early Russian
Cinema Series. According to history
professor Daniel Kaiser, the series
teaches people about the realities of
Russian culture between 1912 and
1916, in addition to teaching the
beauty of silent ﬁlm.

The ﬁrst ﬁlm in the series. “The
Peasant's Lot," was shown on the
27th of January and sucked the audir
ence into its silent world of Russian
culture. Junior Lee Zappas said that
the ﬁlm was “Wonderful to watcli‘Y
partly due to the fact that they “have

a very different feel from the slick
features oftoday,” The biggest dif-
ference that many audience mem»
bers noticed was the absence of
sound so pronounced in today‘s
blockbuster
m o v i e s .
Zappas ex
plains the cone
fusion this
caused by say-
ing, “To be
quite honest, I
didn't quite
understand the
story behind
the film," but
he adds that
this “can only
make one pay
more attention in order to understand
the film better." Jennifer
Whartenby. a Grinnell College
sophomore, described that the film

, was “different than a typical film"

but also, like Zappas, added that the

describes, “in order to apprecmte si-

made during
the period right
before World War I and on the eve
of the Russian Revolution, As Kills
ser explains, it was a time when there
was an increasingly rich urban cul-
ture. This blossoming urban culture
was alienating itself from the coun-

tryside. This resulted in increased
class tensions and the subsequent
mass movements which overthrew

Grinnell to priinnrily givc, as Kaiser
said, “a better sense of the material

Russian history, Kaiser also do

rather studying “what the people

Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy

When 1| phannaccutical company
needs a new hot drug to boost sales,
they turn to a scientist who thinks he
has the answer. A happy pill called
Gleemonex cures depression by in»
tlattng droopyrdrhwcrcd patients
with the dizzy euphoria oftheir hap-
piest memory.

Brain Candy stars the Canadian
comedy troupe Kids in the Hall.
probably bestrknown for theirincon-
sisient but fitfully funny sketch se»
rles which has become a staple of
cable television. Brain Candy has all
the earmarks of the TV show~the
frurnpy, earnest drag queens, the bee
wilderingsexualityibutltmanages
to forge acohesive story out of what
might have been a jumble of wacky
bits and pieces. Unlike so many of
the shapcless, lll‘COl’lCClVed features
that have limped to the big screen
with the help ofSaturday Night Live
veterans (It‘s Fat, to name one) Brain
Candy is better and stronger than the
TV show that spawned it.

In Brain Candy, each “Kid" plays
many roles (shades of Monty Pyr
then). and they slip in and out ofdrag
from scene to scene. The story unr
folds in a parade of happy preschool
colors (pinks, yellows, oranges,
greens), while the sly, energetic came
erainever quite where you’d expect
it to beiobserves from odd angles,
The rise and fall of Gleemonex
makes for a shaip spoof ofa culture
and a society that revolves around
quick ﬁxes and instant gratification.
“We beat penicillin! We beat peni»
clllinl" crows the C.E.O. when he
sees the weekend medication
grosses

Brain Candy succeeds in being a
wry, biting critique ofAmerican culr
lllrc, while avoiding ever being too
preachy or too haughty. In a society
where answers are found more often
in Prozac than laughter. ﬁlms like
this one might be the antidote that
we are looking for,

Go Fish

My ﬁrst impulse would be to say
somethinglike: “Go Fish has many
significant themes that deal with nu-
merous controversial SOClEll issues at
the (lawn ofa new movement." Un-
fortunately, my guess would be that
Go Fir/i was not made or released

aNo on‘dom?

for that purpose, and certainly not at
dawn, For whatever reason, 1 am
reminded ofthe last low-budget ﬁlm
of protest that I saw, The Living
End#a poorly written early eight
to: piccc documenting the angst and
trial of a young gay man with AIDS
and his lover. This ﬁlm would not
be worth anyone's time. except for
the fact that it has historical impor~
lance. They may be of similar genre.
but by no means do I equate Go Fish
with this film, although it holds just
as much imponance for our time.

Go Fish is a concoction. It IS a
mess of one young woman‘s search
for love, another's search for iden-
tity, and a group of lesbian women
trying to survive in a heterosexual
world. Considering the ﬁlm’s low
budget, all of these tales are woven
together quite well, With the ﬁnished
product being an abundance of
thoughtrprovoking issues. The act»
ing leaves much to be desired. but
there are a far greater number of posi-
tives than negatives. The imagery
that relays the moods and emotions
of the characters is extremely well
done, and, to my surprise. a lot of
the ﬁlming depicts each charcter‘s
struggle beautifully. One of the most
powerful scenes portrays a butch
dyke who sleeps with a man. fol»
lowed by her inquisition by an over»
sized panel of angry women. This
scene raises questions of self-iden—
tity which are repeatedly discussed
in the gay community today; this is
just one of the film's various debate
able topics. As far as lowrbudget
ﬁlms go, Go Ftih deﬁnitely towards
the top regarding its quality and sig—
nificance.

Swingers

OK. We didn’t exactly see this
one, However, we have heard from
many sources that it is a hell of a
movie, and both of us are going to
be at Harris this weekend because we
believe it. Allegedly, this is a ﬁlm
about a group of twenty-something
guys who go to California to persue
thier dreams. One of these wild and
crazy guys loses the love of his life.
his long time girlfriend. The rest of
the ﬁlm is about his buddies trying
to cheer him up. Swingers is essen-
tially a movie about guys drinking
beer. playing nintendo, talking about
movies and hanging out. That is
good enough for us.

Go ahead, hate us, We don’t care! 1!

. No chance.

If someone asks you to risk your life for sex,
ask yourself...is that person worth it?

Is anyone worth it? Abstinence is the only

sure way to avoid AlDS and other diseases,

but if you decide to have sex, plan ahead.
