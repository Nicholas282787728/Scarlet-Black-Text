Scarlet i‘i Black . Friday, October 31

‘Eclectic’ Forum serves students and faculty in many ways-

Forum, from page 1

“The Music Department has the
North Lounge reserved from now
until the completion of their build-
ing every Monday though Friday
from 3:00 PM to Midnight ror prac-
tices and rehearsals." said Sims.
"The reality is that they’re not using
all ofthat block oflimc and that when
they're not in there we allow students
to go in to watch TV, use it as an in-
formal meeting space, play table ten:
nis. Several students use the space
to play cards as well,"

“I’m an analyst kind of person,"
said Sims who came to Grinnell in
luly. “and I've looked zit past numr
bars. I would say we're deﬁnitely
busier. When I say we're busier, I
mean I think we’re doing more meetr
mg: and events even with the orches-
train North Lounge as well as we’re
busierinterrns ofthe amountoftraf—
flc that runs though the building,"

But noteveryone is rushing to the
Forum or ﬁnds it a hospitable place

' to be. Some smokers resent the
Forum‘s current nonsmoking policy.
Smoking in the Forum, which was
restricted to the North Lounge last
year after healed debate, has been
eliminated completely this semester
due to the space needs of the Music
Department,

Despite the loss ofsmoking space.

a good
move, “I

said she would. “Ijust want to know
why she made so many enemies,"

Apparently, some people are quite
pleased by the Ferguson‘s resignar
tlon. According to one local merr
chant, it took President Ferguson
only two years to destroy the good
townrcollcge relations it took her
predecessor George Drake twelve
years to build up,

In light of the controversy sur-
rounding Fergisson's resignation, it
is not surprising that rumors abound
regarding her departure.

According to one rumor, Ferguson
was asked to step down because she
hired too many gay and lesbian prOr
fessors.

It’s also been said that the Board
forced her to resign They suppos-
edly have wanted her out for the last
four years.

Another rumor says the Board
fired her because she was opposed
to quantltﬂlivc teaching evaluutioiis.
Her preference of more qualitative
evaluation: supposedly conflicted
with the Board's interest in gaining
higher academic rankings.

“It was a pure numbers scam."
said one student.

Despite gossip, the “real reason.“
for Ferguson‘s resignation, if it lics
beyond her professed desire to takc
a leave of absence before resuming
