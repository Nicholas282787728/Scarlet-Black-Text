Jeremy goes to the movies

Our Phavorite PhiIm Phantatic Jeremy Talbert
has second thoughts about Peter Coyote

Folks. Ican‘tbegin to explain how
hard it has been to motivate myself
to tell you about this week’s ﬁlm. It's
not that I’m lazy, it's just that I‘ve
been trying to figure out how to put
into print all the disgust. anger and
general rage I feel knowing that
you‘re going to be watching a ﬁlm
that I wouldn‘t force convicts on
death row to watch. I can guarantee
that about 95% of the campus is go-
ing to hate it. Kika, brought to us by
Pedro Almodovar, is the stirring tale
of Peter Coyote as a writer who has
a stepson who is into kinky sex with
ahairdresser
with the
most annoy-
ing voice in
the world
who has a
lesbian maid
who is at-
tracted to her
who has a
brother who
is a cone
victed rapist
porn star
known to

have sex
with farm

Have I turned you off from this film
yet? Good, I want a challenge.

It is set somewhere in Spain, I
think. not that it matters. It has a lot
of really bad Spanish actors and ac
tresses that I‘ve never heard of nor
do Lhope to see again, The plot
grinds along and 1 think it is sup-

tasteless.

I’m sick of wasting my
time with ﬁlms that
are billed as “contro-
versial” or “thought- a“
provoking”
they really end up
being is sickening and

posed to be funny at points, but I
wasn't laughing. Sonic at the din-
log will have you laughing lll disbce
lief maybe, as the maid with a nose
the size of Canada describes to Kika
(the hairdresser) her brother. Tales
of incest, bestiality, and rape might
make you snicker because you're
uncomfortable. Mostly, you're g0,
ing to be either trying to convince a
stubborn friend to leave or quietly
making plans to sack the projector
booth. I have consulted with several
gypsy psychics, and all say the show-
ing of this film will end in disaster
The only
strong point

is that n

and will
give an op-
portunily to
those
when all ”‘ k,‘ “ 3
Spanish to
learn ltow to
say “rape
sheep, pigs,
and cows.“
From there,
I can only
. think of a
few uses ofthis film. As I mentioned
before, it could be used as some sort
of sadistic torture method for people
who committhemostheinouscnmes
(like making movies this bad). It
could be used to level out the short
leg on a Coffee table (in cassette
form). Then again, it would prob-

with Everyone Say: [Love You. Am
I getting through here?

The acting is horrible. The edit~
ing is horrible, The cinematography
is horrible, The subject matter will
probably start riots. If you don’t read
anything else in my review, READ
THIS: this film has a humorous rape
scene. I‘m talking about a graphic

ing raped, with witty dialog. and even
bumbling cops who try to drag the
man off of her, Who in the hell
thought that it would be a good idea
to Show a film like this to
Grinnellians? Ifyou so much as even
said the word "rapist" last semester,
people would go out for blood, An-
gry women marched not once but
twice at night, and rightly so, I sup-
pose,

[am beginning to see a theme here
in the movies being shown to us this
year. We’ve seen maybe two or three
movies that I could consider main
stream ﬁlms. Now I'm the last one
in the world to defend mainstream
culture, but I don’t think those of us
who go to the movies on a Friday
night want to have to think. A think-
ing ﬁlm once and a while is all right,
but this artsy crap is starting to get
on my nerves. Last year, we were
presented with all of the Academy
Award nominees for Best Pictures.
Oh, bliss! Those were movies I long
to write reviews for. I'm sick of wastv
ing my time with films that are billed
as “controversial" or “thought-pro-
voking" when all they really end up
being is sickening and tasteless.
Films Committee, 1 hope you're lis-
tening. One more of these and I'm
going to hold a coup. Under my glo-
rious reign, we’ll watch ﬁlms like
The Saint, Fifth Element, hopefully
someday, Contact, and if I feel nos-
talgic, Ferris Bueller’r Day 017,

Before I give the rating on this
movie I want you to bear in mind that
when I devised my system, I never
believed I would have to give any-
thing less than o‘ne. Iregret that now.
Kika gets one out of four badly
dubbed Peter Coyotes. He obviously
doesn‘t speak Spanish, and its some-
what entertaining to watch how
poorly the dialog is synched. When
you‘re forced to watch the movie,
you have to entertain yourselfsome-
how.

The Pillow Book:

Starring Ewan McGregor, The
Pillow Book differs slightly from
Trainspollillg, A young Japanese
girl becomes obsessed with literah

ure and writing on bodies, at whichdered

point she encounters MeGregor's
character.

Ruby in Paradise:

Ashley Judd makes her debut
performance In a ﬁlm about a
young woman who leaves her
native Tennessean town and heads
for Panama City, Florida. She
works at a local tourist trap, and
the ﬁlm examines her complex
character. Directed by Victor
Nunez (Ulee': Gold).

Carmen:

Georges Bizet‘s operatic transe
iation of Prosper Merimee's
novella, (Spain. 1983, subtitles,
color and black andwhite, 90min.)

Rosewood:

This 1997 ﬁlm tells the two
story of Rosewood, a black
Florida town which was bun-led
to the ground and its people mur-

because ofa lie, although some
escaped due to the action of some
courageous people, One was a
drifter played by Ving Rhames;
another was a Storekeeper played
by Jon Voight. This reenactment
of the events which took place in
1923 brings to the screen one of
the 20th century’s most horren-
dous, yet overlooked. episodes of
lynch-mob rule. While document-
ing the depths to which acts of
racial prejudice can sink, still, it
holds out hope by showing that a
few were willing to risk all to
resist such action and to assist its
victims. The New York Times
said: “A shocking outrageous
event: a thought-provoking ﬁlm.“

Violinist-pianist duo play the

classics

BY PHOEBE SILAG
StaffWriter

Melissa Roberts ‘99, an English
major, will present a violin recital
with pianist Barbara Lien at 2 pm.
tomorrow in Herrick Chapel. The
performance is free and open to the
public.

Roberts will perform “Adagio
cantabile" from Romance No. 2 by
Beethoven; “Chamnne” from Partita
No. 2 by Bach; “Chante de Roxane"
from the opera “Le Roi Roger" by
Karol Szymanowski; Slavonic
Dances 2 by Antonin Dvor’tk, are

' ranged by Fritz Kreisler; and
“Csardas” by V. Monti, an example
of Hungarian folk music. “It will be
almost an hour‘s wonh of music,"
Roberts said.

“The biggest one, ‘Chaconne.’ is
the mother of all violin pieces," she
continued. “It is over twenty min-
utes long depending on how the vio-
linist interprets it. It doesn’t have any

rests because there is no accompanie »

ment," Roberts chose the piece be-
cause it is “very profound music.
Technically and musically. there is
so much in it. Inever get sick of play-
ing it, I always find new thingsI can
interpret differently," she said.

“The Beethoven I have been play-
ing for a long time," Roberts added.
“I have always liked it a lot. It has
nostalgia for me."

Roberts began playing the violin
