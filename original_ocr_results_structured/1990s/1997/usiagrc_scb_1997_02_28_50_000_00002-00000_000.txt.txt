BY KEVIN MCGOLDRICK
Staff Writer

Reporter: If you could talk about
your show using only ﬁve words
what would they be. . . or ﬁve and a
half, or six?

(Pause)

Brad : Well let's see one of the
words has to be rap!

Reporter: What do you like most
about rap, what makes you rap guys?

Blake: Like, um I like rap‘.

Reporter: There has to be some
thing about the music that inspires
you.

Brad: Ido'n't know I think...

Blake: It‘s like poetry with a beat

Brad: Yeah, it’s like deeper, there
isn’t that superﬁcial quality,

Blake: Yeah they tell it like it is.

Reporter: What are your favorite
rap artists?

Blake : An all time favorite of
mine is DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh
Prince. I don‘t know why, it wasjust
back in the school, it was funny.
Now, I like Tu Pac and Wu-Tang
cause it thumps. I'm just really into
beats.

Reporter. So give a brief cross—
cut of the stuff you play on your
show.

Blake: Ice Cube, Too Short, DI
Quick, EPMD. Fu-schnickens, Easy
E, Eric Sermon, Wu-Tang, Snoop,
Dre. someone that was making fun
ofDre.

Brad: West Side . . .

Blake: Connection,

Reporter: What do you think
about the controversy over rap lyr»
ics’!

Brad :1 think some of the lyrics
get exploited, some of it you got to
take on the light side

you can't take it all so serious, you

_ have to incorporate what there my
ing and realize that its not the way it
is in all cases.

Reporter: Do you think mp IS
'more exploited compared to other
music?

Blake : I think it kind of is, it
seems they put the explicit lyrics and
they put it on rap, where as I have
friends here that play stuff that I’ve

, just never heard of cause Ijust don‘t
like it, and it's Iikejust as dirty, even
women are like talking like turn you
upside down, and get every last drop
out. And I was like you listen to that,
you listen to Datl and they talk down
on rap,

Brad: I think it's just bulls‘*t to

2AM -Skip the

take the lyrics :tndjusl butcher them,
they put them there for a reason I
remember seeing Ice T interviewed
once, and he talked about how he
makes the music he does to make
people aware of what’s going on m
the country.

Reporter: Well, getting away from
the music, what do you like about
DJ'ing itself'7

Blake: (Sarcastically) Well, what
I like are the cart machines because
it's like you get to go through all these
cassettes, and on top of that you get
to look through them all and ﬁnd out
which ones work...lialf of them say
don’t work on them and warble like
(Warble soundl

Brad: Oh yeah, but what I like
about the show, we get in there early
and pick records, and we usually start
of with some old school, and then
we'lljuststan playing stuffwe’ll find
around the studio.

“I think some of
the lyrics get
exploited, some
of it you got to _
take on the light
side, you can’t
take it all so
serious. ”

--Brad Htlkene
Rap DJ

Blake: Kind ofllke Tony D, a k.a.
Harvey Wallbanger. He’s a cool cat.

Brad: [like runaway slaves, it‘s
called

Blake: Yo, yo

Brad: where the ho: at!

Blake: Girls, love that song!

Reporter: What would be like the
best moment you‘ve had on your
show so far

Reporter: I think our best moment
was when somebody called, we
didn‘t know who it was, who called
and requested.

Ultimately, Galbreath and Htlkene
challenge the campus to expand their
minds by listening to music that is
rarely heard on the Grinnell airwaves.
On Sunday night from 12AM >2AM
skip the intro and feed your mind the
lyrical beats of the old and the new
of rap,

Squares - Stella ’h‘an

' BY KEVIN MCGOLDRICK
Staff Writer

Reporter: Just siartoffby givrng
us a general format for the show.

Eric. The format of the show is
basically a sports call in show, and
we try and get listener response. We
try and break it up into different seg-
ments, You know we'll have a seg—
ment where we talk about the cur-
rent iiews, cxcepl we have a sepa
rate section for baseball and spring
training.

Reporter,
baby?

Eric: Yeah, we do like to talk
about baseball 3 lot and we have got
a lot of response from baseball. In
addition to baseball we also ask a
couple of triVia questions as a way
to get listeners to call in. [Prizes so
far - Big Cookies]

Reporter Whatmade you decide
to do a sports talk show?

Eric: We felt that there would be
interest on campus. We thought, as
far as we know, there hasn’t been a
forum for voicing opinions on sports
in a while. So people haven’t really
had a place. other than talking
amongst themselves, to express thcir
views about sports.

Reporter: Do you ﬁnd that people
call in to express these views?

Eric: I think we have found that
people really are legitimately inter»
ested in having a sports talk show,
They are interested in voicing their
opinion.

Reporter: How does it feel to do
a talk show and being on the spot
when callers call in?

Brett: I think it helps that there
are at least three of us, like some-
body called in last week asking about
Tiger Woods and I knew something
aboutTiger Woods that I thought was
funny, soIcould comein with it right
away.

Eric: Il seems to work pretty well
because it is a sports call in show.
We‘re not pretending to be experts
in the field, we want to hear other
people‘s opinion, if we could we
would rather hear from other people.

Reporter: Do you ﬁnd that your
listernshlp includes all kinds of
people?

, Eric: We try to be as incliisive a
radio show as possible, we love calls
from everyone from both sexes . . . I
don't think we have had a female

Is baseball your big

caller yct, we're still waiting for that,
we mighteven reward the ﬁrst female
calierwithatreat because that would
be groundbreaking.

Reporter: Other DJ's have come
mentcd on problems lhcy have en-
countered with the phone patch, how
do you deal with this as your show
is a call in Show?

Brett: All three weeks we have
had problems With the phone patch.
Idon't know ifiiducsn‘t work or we
are not doing it right.

Eric: It‘s definitely a problem,
sometimes to the point where you
think it can ruin a show, Adam

' [Kempenaar] taped part of last

week’s show and part of it sounded
just awful in terms of feedback. The
reason we have our show is so vicw-
ers can call in and voice their opinr
ion, so hopefully we‘ll‘gei that flg'
tired out.

_ Reporter: What so far in the show
has been your favorite call or mo
ment in the three weeks you've been

‘doiiig the show?

Brett: Ithink my favorite moment
was when a caller, who will remain
nameless, asked Jeff Clement if It
was true that he got stoned at half-
time to improve his performance in
the second half, and ifthe trainer had
hooked him up with the weed.

Reporter: What are the shows you
have had so far'.7

Brett: We've had three shows so
far, one dealt strictly with JeffClem-
ent, the others were should Pete Rose
tc 'n the Hall of Fame and Dallas
Cowboys: America‘s Team or
America’s Most Wanted.

Reporter: What controversial or
other type of topic are you planning
for this week?:

Eric: We don’t have the specific
topic down, but we do know its gor
ing to deal with college basketball,

Reporter: Ultimately, are you
guys going for the Dickie at the end
of the year?

Brett: Actually,Idon’teven know
what the Dickie is, is it for best talk

Show.

Reporter: Yeah, I think that's what
it is.

Eric: Actually, I’m just having
fun.

So if you want to listen to the fun
ﬁlled airwaves of sports radio, tune
in Fridays zit 2PM and let Baker,
Broge and Kempenaar, open your
mind to a world of controversy, hue
mor and culture, the World of sports.

At the Movies...

West Side Story

Okay, can we talk? When I think
about West Side Story, the very first
thing that pops into my head was a
production that I saw back in thc
dayithe high school day, that is
(which really wasn’tthat long ago?
ask any Howard Sternresque radio
personality, they love to talk about
it.) Anyway, it was a show at one of
the rival high schools, Maria had ab-
solutely no dramatic ability whatso-
ever. and Tony had the largest ass I
have ever seen in my short but excit-
ing life (whose life isn't exciting
when you get to write for the S &
a?)

The thing that bothered me about
the ass of this allegedly talented in
Iruder who tried to be the leading
man of this musical was this: Tony
is supposed to be hot. All right?
Tony is supposed to make me drool
when he croons about the girl whom
he falls in love with upon ﬁrst glance
in the streets of the big apple. This
is one ofthe things you can look for-
ward to in the ﬁlm (which, by the
way, will be at Harris this weekend),
Tony is damn good looking, and

 

with Nick Terpolilli and Win Rosenfeld

 

 

when he sings, it’s enough to make
any girl want to change their name
to Maria—or
maybe Mario.
The musical is,
of Course, a
beautiful adapr
ration of the
classic tragic roe
malice by the
big W,S.,
Roman and
Juliet (the film
version of
which will be at
Harris next
Weekend.) The
show has a very
simple but use-
ful thcmc—
p r cj u d i c c

may just be

that can take the corny factor of mu-
sical theatre, consider the fact that

One of the things
you can lookfor—

Side Story: Tony is

ing, and when he
sings, it’s enough
to mdke any girl

Michael Crichton
thriller Every
plot point is ex-
plained at least
thrcc times in
dialogue before being realized in ace
lion, and the actors. especially Bill
Paxton, appear to be truly cmbar»

rasscd by the script In an inlcrcsl-
ing twist, while the good guys in this
movie are Weathermen, the bad guys
are also weatheimen—Bad Weather-
men, in black vans ..ooh, scary, huh?

To make things worse, the film
suffered from sappy melodrama and
contrived confliCt. Most ofthe cen-
tral areas of intended suspense and
tenSion were so obvious iii the means
of their resolution, that they became
inortectunl and cumbersome. Every
deaihrdefying ncur escape in an ac-
tion sequence seemed so predictable
that the potential for thrills was mas
sively reduced.

This being said, I wouldn't deem ‘

the film a complete waste. If for no
other reason. the film offers some
great eye candy and is sure to please
the retinas...but that is all. It seems
that Ihc SGA films committee has
caught a lot of l'lack from the student
body for not biingtng enough “block.
busters." If this kind of film is the
result ofthat, then is it really worth
multi—million dollar special effects”
If movies were not free at Harris, I
would rcccomend that you give this
one a complete “blow off ”

Chennete to play harp

BY PHOEBE SILAG
Staff Writer

Jeaniiiziric Chcncltc will give a
Faculty Recital Sunday al 7 p.m. ill
Herrick Chapel. Chenctte wtll
present Celtic Collage, a collection
of Scottish. Irish. and Welsh songs.
wlnch she will pertorm on a Celtic
harp She will also srng some songs.
“I have included this harp on prth-
ous concerts, but I haven't focused
on it before," Chenelte said. “This
is also the first time I’ve sung in pub
lit: for a long time."

Chenette Will be playing a 34.
string harp with bronze wires, which
is smaller than a concert harp.
“There are no pedals, but there are
levers on individual wires so that you
can change the pitch of each string
by one semirtone," she said. “The
levers enable the harps to play in dif
ferent keys."

Chenetie, who was originally

trained as a concert harpist, begun .

playing the Celtic harp in 1994, “I
had an opportunity to stay in Great
Britain for a year," Chenclte said. “I
did some work on my own and stud
ied with leading harpers from Scots
land and Ireland. I traveled to inu-
seums to look at different kinds of
harps. The harp is actually the na-
tional instrument of Wales."
According to Chenetie, the Celtic
harp is a “living tradition. There is a
lot of literature that comes to us from
Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. It was

origiiia lly part ofbasic cultural herir
rage, but due to pressures from the
outside. the songs entered the folk
repertoire and were not played on
harp for many years, We don'tknow
exactly how they played the songs,
but I'm taking them back and play»
ing them on harp," Chenettc are
ranged all the works that she will be
performing.

“I am basrcally going to be play-
ing a variety of songs,” Cliencttc
said. "There are some very lively
songs, as well as some meditative
and emotionally expressive pieces,"
Songs included are “The
Londonderry Air," an Irish song, and
“The Ash Grove,” aWelsh song that
“people will recognize even if they
don‘t recognize the title," according
to Chenetic. She also plans to in»
clude “Devil In the Kitchen." It is
an example ofa “siratchspcy,” aprOr
nounced rhythmic dance from Scot-
land.

Chenette plans to perform Celtic
Collage throughout March, and she
will give concerts in Ankeny, Ft.
Dodge, and Newton, “St. Patrick's
Day seems to bring our alotofinterr
est in Celtic tradition," she said.

Cheriette's tour began February
20, when she gave a concert at the
Mayﬂower Home. “It was very
warmly received," Chenette said.
“People seemed to enjoy it all. and
on the last song we had kind of a
sing~along. It was very enjoyable."

 

Off—campus student

art exhibit opens
“Still Life With Tuscan Green Sauce”

By JOSH TOBIESSEN

The works of five student anists
will be presented tonight between 7
and 10 pm. at 9 to to Main St. Apt.
#4. The show entitled “Still Life
With Tuscan Green Sauce" will fea
ture a variety ofpaintings and draw
ings by Tine Hayes ‘97, Shaka
McGlotten ‘97. Matt Salia ‘97, Josh
Tobicsscn ‘97 arid Evan Wilcox ‘97.

Huycs‘ work COnSISIS of large
painted portraits of historical politir
cal ﬁgures in black and white with
the occasional use of a strong red.
These larger than life figures starc
boldly at the viewer and suggest ob-
vious connections to political propAr
gandabanners However, the coil-
text in which one might expect to
view these images is removed, and
the Viewer is forced to look at the
image in a new way.

McGIottcn contributes several
drawings incharcoal and pastels Hls
imagery includes energetic figural

work along wtth abstract forms,
sometimes combining text and imr
agery.

The drawings of Tobiessen
achieve a dark and weathered look
through the thorough working and
reworking of the paper The use of
charcoal, ink, water. collage, sand-
paper and razor blades were all cm-
ployed in an attempt to achieve |hc
appearance ofdepth on It two dimenr
sional surface.

Saiia‘and Wilcox have been ex—
plorlng the possibilities of collabo-
ration in an ongoing proycci. Their
formal abstractions in pastel are
largely experiments dealing with
how their individual styles Complir
merit and contradict each other in a
joint venture that attempts to turn out
a coherent piece.

At 8 p iii. there will be an artist
talk with a chance afterwards to ask
questions and talk with the artists.
All are welcome to attend Refresh-
ments wtll be served.
