BLISS: Tactical voting is key

continued from page 7

from the race of the party's heavy-
weights, they are now about to nomi-
nate Bill Clinton. a man whose ﬂac-
cidity defies belief. Unless Jerry
Brown can sustain himself long
enough to broker the convention, we
are facing the candidacy of someone
with so many skeletons in his closet
that two dozen hacks for national
newspapers are camped out in the
archives of his own state capital look,
ing for more dirt. To complicatemat»
ters further, we are faced with the
most serious third party candidacy
since Teddy Roosevelt tired of Taft in
1912, with the politically vague and
enormously rich computerization
whizz Ross Perot hovering over the
T866.

What can one do? Bush is a creep,
Clinton a sleazeball, and Perot
panyless. In a race between the three
of them. 40% of the vote could e a
winning total. Don’t lose heart - take
a close look at policies. Perot com-
binessmneinterestingstandpointsthat
are very much in the political maina
stream but unpopular with special
interest groups: he is pro-choice (fun-
damentalists take warning), in favor
of guncontrol (move over. NRA) and
a strong advocate of the economi-
callyresponsiblepro—growthpolicies

that Paul Tsongas pushed so hard in
his unsuccessful campaign (that’s you.
AARP). His rabid anti-union views
may offend, however. They were dif-
ﬁcult even for fellow GM executives
to stomach after he sold his company
to the Detroit based automaker in
return for a couple of billion and a
seat on the board (now vacated).
Clinton,asonewhosereading spreads
beyond the pages of the tabloids
should know, has somegood policies
too; economically he is close to both
Tsongas and Perot, recognising the
need to use a modicum of govern-
ment policy to pull us out of our
current mire. and he is a strong advo-
cate of various Individual righB. a
woman‘s right to choice included.
But many conservatives who could
find Perot appealing may also find
voting for a Democrat like Clinton
difﬁcult to stomach. In short, either
would be a huge improvement over
what we have now. But neither is
perfect.

The essential truth to recognize is
that Bush must be removed from of-
fice. Hence, a phenomenon few
American voters have heard of may
catch on. It is called tactical voting,
and it played akey factor in a number
of marginal seats in the recentBritish
election. In Bath, for example, Con-
servative Pany chairman ChrisPatten

lost his seat to the Liberal Democrats
after Labour voters. realizing their
candidate did not have a chance of
winning in that very bourgeois seat.
switched their support to the Liberal
candidate. Apply it to the United
States. where the president is elected
by delegates from each state rather
than by direct popular vote, and the
logic becomes clear. Here is what
amounts to an election in 50 different
seats, with delegations proportional
to their population that go entirely to
the winner regardless of his/her share
of the vote or how many candidates
there are. All of them larger are than
any British election constituency and
they are few enough in number that
opinion polling in each one is both
feastbleand accurate. Watch the polls
like a hawk, and vote for whichever
ofPerot and Clinton is best placed to
beat Bush in your state. If Perot or
Clinton get the 270 electoral votes
needed to take the White House, then
we can be sure things will improve at
leasta little. If no one gets 270 it is up
to the new House of Representatives
to decide. They will surely not touch
Bush with a bargepole, and they may
even ﬁnd someone better than any-
one already in the race. Happy vot-
ingl

The professors are very helpful
according to Daurice; most of them
have children and understand that a
sick child cannotbe simply carted off
to daycare. It seems as if Daurice‘s
professors and her friends are the
only one: who have gathered around
her in a positive manner. She wishes
that more people would realize that
pregnancy and children are simply a
panof life. Daurice certainly does not

abortion. She chose to have a baby.
And this decision should not be seen
as stupid, or aberrant behavior.

Daurice is not the only woman on
campus with a child. For a college

to make this apparent in every piece
of propaganda which me RR. De»

a pregnant woman or one with ababy

classroom.

There is no support structure for
these women. AtDaurice‘s insistence,
Student Affairs has agreed to appoint
a contact person who will supply in-
formation on housing and medical
details to pregnant students. More
can be done to address the needs of
parents on campus: the mothers

assured that you have the strength to
get out ofsuch situations, but I'm not
hoping for the impossible. This is
something that women have to be
able to do. It doesn't come naturally,
women were taught by society to be
submissive, so I wish you good luck,
women, because I know that this is
hard.

Understand that men have the prob
lem of being taught by society as
well. They have been trained to be in
control. So you can’t just say "no."
You have to break that barrier and
force him to understand if he isn't
listening.

Men who are reading this, I wish
you would Lry to understand what I
am trying to say, as well. Itis hard for
women to beassettivc. Submission is
a very difficult thing to outgrow. So
think before you act, and conscrously

try to give up some of the control.
This will take a lot more effort than'
you think becauseyou probably don".
realize how much control you have.
