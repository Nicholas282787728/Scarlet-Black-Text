After winning the southern divi-
sion Midwest Conference Champi-
onship over Knox and Coe, the
Grinnell College men’s tennis team
lost to Ripon last Friday in the dual
meet championship. With an over-
all dual
record of
1 3 win 5
and 7
losses, the
Pioneers
f i n i s h e d
second in
the confer-
ence. On
Saturday
and Sun-
d a y
G r i n n e 11
played in the singles and doubles
ﬂight championships and scored a re-
spectable 42 points.

Despite losing in the meet cham—
pionship. 6-1, the Pioneers enjoyed
some spectacular season-ending per-
formances At No. 1 singles senior
Muji Sherdil ended his career with
the only win of the day for Grinnell,
a spectacular three set performance
in which he beat a regionally ranked
player who went on to win the singles
championship Saturday. Unfortu-
nately, Sherdil’s ailing arm prevented
him from continuing his excellent
play in the singles ﬂight where he
was knocked out in the quarterfinals
by a player from Beloit,

Another impressive performance
was turned in by the freshman
phenom, Seth Pourciau at No. 2
singles. Pourciau played an excel-
lent three set match against a player
who also went on to win a chamin
onship for his ﬂight. Saturday he
made it to the ﬁnals ofhis ﬂight, los-
ing in another three set match with
the same player from Ripon. Coach
Andy Hamilton cemented, “Seth is
going to be atop-notch player in the
conference all four years."

Also at the singles championship
Josh Tepfer ‘97 had a great day to
end his Grinnell career. Playing in
the No. 3 ﬂight, Tepfer won a satis-

in the semifinals but in the ﬁnals lost
to Ripon. Hamilton was pleased to
see Tepfer make it to the ﬁnals as a
senior. “It’s great to see good things

Hamilton. Tepfer said of his play at

At No. 5 singles senior Themios
Carabas met essentially the same
fate, losing to another player from the
tough Lake Forest team.

Abright spot emerged for the Pio-
neers at the No. 6 singles position
which was filled by senior Frank
Davis in the absence of Nate
Solmose ‘00. Davis, an unseeded
player, won against Illinois College
in the quarterﬁnals and beat a seeded
player from Cornell, finally losing in
the semifinals. “Frank seized the
opportunity and played outstanding
tennis," said Hamilton. “I’m glad he
could end his career that way.”

Overall, the team is very happy
about their play this season. Cer-
tainly a highlight was winning the
southern division title over two very
tough teams, Knox and Cue, in im-
pressive fashion. Also, the Pioneers
scored 42 points at the singles and
doubles championship compared to
last year’s 31 points. “I am ex-
tremely pleased and excited about
this season," said Hamilton. “We
have been very fortunate to have
such great leaders in the graduating
seniors, and stand to benefit greatly
in the future from our very talented
underclassmenﬂ’

Best ﬁnish since 1989 signals
softball team’s bright future

Sports Information

Even though the Grinnell Colv
lege softball team‘s record was
the best since 1989 with marks
of 4-6 in the Midwest Confer-
ence and 8-15
overall, Coach
Janelle Tieken
sees signs of suc-
cess in many
other ways, and
forecasts a rosy
future,

“Overall, our
won-loss record
does not show the
vast improvement
we made from
Feb.l to the end of the season.
Everyone worked hard and did
their best to improve the team,"
Coach Tieken observed. “We
didn‘t have a power offense,
mostly single hitting so each
player had to do her part. People
were stepping up when we
needed it. We definitely were in
most games, especially in the
conference,” she added.

Five Pioneers batted over

son were Jan Maxwell, freshman
outfielder/pitcher. at .409; Vicky
Drake,junior shortstop. at .340;
Becky Oberly, sophomore out-
fielder, at .350; Sarah Conner,

Erin Doyle, sophomore infielder,
at .329.

Coach Tieken also was satis—
fied with the defensive perfor-
mance as her team played six er-
'rorless games and had only one
miscue in another six games.

Senior Catherine Brown,
voted by her teammates as the
MVP, was the top pitcher with a
1.52 ERA and a 2-1 record in the
conference. ”That s outstandr

ing," exclaimed the coach. Also
impressive on the mound was
Maxwell who picked up the other
two conference wins.
Optimism for the future is
based on the
youth of the
squad. Only two
seniors. Brown
and outfielder
Cary Perillo, will
be graduating,
Returning will be
one junior, nine
sophomores and
five freshmen.
“We certainly
will miss
Catherine and ‘Iggy,’ but we
have a good nucleus returning
The outlook is bright, We have
new goals to set and attain but
we’re on the right ltnck. Both
physically and mentally, we have
the stuff to become a contender
in the conference,” Coach Tieken
predicted, The coach also ex—
pressed deep appreciation for the
contribution of her assistants,
Traci Smith who is in her fourth
year, and Lance Drcesmnn.

Saturday’s only upset was with
the performance of the 4 x 400

by the 4x400. It was a team I
thought would win, but we were
cut off and one of our athletes fell.
We'll get another chance this
weekend," Freeman commented,

in field events, Freeman saw
steady progress from Thad Lesiak
who continues to improve in the
discus. He also credited the per-
formance of Wade Krause, back off
of an injury and “looking good in
the longjump." In the pole vault.
Scott Barkley also turned in a fine
performance Willi a vault of 11' 0'.

The test of the season behind

Looking to bounce back after .1

Aside from that, however, the
Pionecrs had little to cheer about.
“We have not been playing well as
a lcam,"~ noted Coach Greg
Wallace. “Sometimes one or two
players will go out and perform
brilliantly, but the rest of the team
will falter. That is what accounts
for our teatn struggling."

The Pioneers will strive for con-
sistcncy this week at the MWC
championship. Coach Wallace is
convinced that stronger perfora
mnnces from his upper-tier play~
crs, along with greater consistency
from the learn as a whole, would
give Grinnell 3 chance to establish
itself among the elite teams in the
conference.
