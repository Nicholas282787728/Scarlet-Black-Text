It is simply inefficient to funnel
food through animals: the nutrients in
the foods fed to animals are attenuated
drastically as they travel through the
animals' bodies to the camlvore's tar
ble. For example, grain and soy, fun—
neled through animals, lose: 90% of
the protein, 99% otdie carbohydrates,
and 100% ofthe ﬁber (there is no ﬁber
