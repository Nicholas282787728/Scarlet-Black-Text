Thc film opens in the Muguct

Project the morning after riots
sparked by police brutality have
ravaged the community. Over the
next 24 hours, the audience follows
the activities of Sayid, Vinz, and
Hubert as their feelings of
disempowerment ﬂuctuate from
despair to rage. Glimpses of fam—
ily life emphasize tangible needs
(such as food), but the youths
seek more abstract needs, Vinz.
for example, believes he can find
respect through a gun.

The three protagonists travel
out of their normal environs to a
part of the city where, despite
luxury, violence is equally as per-
vasxve. Through dialogue as well
as hztphazard encounters, the pro

tagonists become fully devel-
oped in humanistic terms. One
of the most insightful scenes is a
scatological monologue by a
stranger in a men’s room. In such
scenes the director reminds the
viewer that Sayid, Vinz, and
Hubert remain children despite
their brushes with mortality.

As the name implies. the film
focuses on abstract concepts.
However. the boys’ experiences
are grounded in the realities of
everyday life and the fragility of
existence.
