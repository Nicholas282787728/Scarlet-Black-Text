_ The American Dream:
Dea’rh, Domination, and The Pursuit of. DDT

BY TOR JANSON

This is pair swo ofmy commenrary on Dennis Avery's visir ro Grinneil
college. ifyou missed she lasi column, I argued rhas people should respond
ro rhose rhey don’r agree wirh by noneviolcm means, rarher rhan dumping
pies on heads. In rhis column 1 will address some ofrhe argumenrs made by
Mr. Avery during his sray here.

Mr. Avery advocaied “high yield conservarionLihe idea rhar ihc besr
way so save wildlife habirar is so maximize per acre yields on she land already
in farm produciion. He claimed rhar she agriculiural advancemenss made
since 1960 have saved 1810 million acres ofwildlife habiras. in his view.
arrcmprs ro regulare rhe agenrs ofrhis high producsivisy (namely pesricidcs
and generic rechnology) are rhreass so wildlife habirai and qualiry oflife: He
also believes rhar arremprs ro preserve remperare wildlife habirars will only
facilisare she desrrucsion ofrropical biodiversiry. in his handour so she zudi»
ence, he wrose, “The environmenral movemenr seems so wanr managed scars
ciry for a few people. ir seems so wans more bison and prairie dogsiand
fewer corn planes_ on American land even ifshar sacriﬁces wildlands and
biodiversisy elsewhere."

Mr. Avery never esrablisbes rhe crucial connecrion in rhis argrrmens. Do
increases in she agriculrural produciion omrsrworld narions relieve destruc»
rive pressures on wildlands in isopical forests? Unforrunarely, she world is
nor so simplissic. The anrhropologisrs Schmink and Wood (1937) suggesr

zon rainroresss; 1) she unsure of producrion in a region; 2) she class ssruciure
ofrhe sociery and lines ofconflicr over access so producrive resources; 3) she
extent and kinds ofmarkei relarions in which producers are involved; 4) she
role ofshe srare in defining and crecuiing resource policies, 5) rnrernarional
inreresrs, such as donor agencies or privare investors; and 6) she ideology
lb.“ orients resource use.

Mr. Avery's argumeni suggcsrs rhar rherc is some sorr ofglobal acirgeisr,
invisible hand, or perhaps a regularory organiaasion which insures rhas if
food produerion increases in one pair ofihe world, environmensal desrruc-
rion will cease in anoihcr. Since 1960, rhe same rrme frame in which Mr.
Avery claims increased agriculrural efﬁciency saved so much wildlife, ihe
wildiands in rhe rropics ofrhe world have suffered an unprecedenred and
aggressive assaulr. As long as is is pronsabic for humans ro desiroy rainforesr,
rhe rain foress will be desrroyed, regardless ofhow many people she unired
Srarcs is feeding, in she Amaron, one problem is ihar large scale enserpriscs
have been given land as consessionary prices by govcrirrncnrs. When land is
so cheap, is is more profrrable for she business so dessroy rhe land and move
on rhan is is re preserve ii (Painrer 1995),

Mr. Avery, rhe aurhor of Saving rhc planer Wirh Pesricides and Plasiic,
advocares rhar pessicides should be used ersensrvciy and rcgulared lighrly. He
argues rhas “high yield conservarion" is nor possible wrrhous heavy use of
pcsricides and herbicides. i find his unyielding fairh in pessicides curious,
one would rhink a man dedicared ro saving ihe planer would wanr io mini-
mize she damage so wildlife caused by peer managemenr policies Mr, Avery
simply chooses ro believe rhar pesricides do nor cause harm io wildlife, dc-
spire mounrains ofcvidence so she Contrary, He also lied arbour rhc campaign
obiecrives ofhis opponenrs in order so paini shem as unreasonable cxircm-
isrs. During a luncheon afser Convocarion, Mr. Avery expressed rncreduliry
when i sold him rhar Rachel Carson never called for a ban ofail pesrieidcs, in
her book or laser in her career. I insisred on ihe poinr, having read Silenr
Spring. as well as a recenr arricle abous her in Audubon magaaine (Graham
1998). For ihe record, she wrosc in Silcns Spring, “ii is nor my conrenrron
rhar chemical insecricides musr never be used. I do conrcnd rhas we have pur
poisonous and biologically poscnr chemicals indiscriminarely in she hands
ofpersons largelyorwholly ignoranr ofrherr poreniials for harm.” Mr. Avery
said rhas ir didn’r marrcr whar she said, only whai people heard. Because of

her work, organiaarions such as she Sierra Club are unreasonably rrying so
ban all pesricides, he said. Acrually, according so she Sierra Club websire,
accepsabie pesi managemeni ssraregies “may include culrural, biological,
chemical, or physical modifrearrons ofrhc environmenr." They also say rhas
“use ofroxlc or biologically acrive subsrances or generically airercd organisms
should be righrly reguiased ro prevens harm ro people and nasural and agri.
culruraisilviculrural ecosystems," Cerrarnly, rhis is a siance Mr. Avery would
disagree wirh, bus is is nor rhe srance he porrraycd she group as possessing.

indeed, Mr, rivery's fairh in pessicrdes is so complere rhar he denies shar
DDT is a harmful rhrear ro rhe environmenr. He rold us as she luncheon
rhas all evidence linking DDT so bird popularion declines is circrrmsranrial
He said is was never proven rhar rhesc declines were widespread or nor pars
of narural populaiion cycles. I asked him, “Are you saying she near extinc-
sion of she peregrine falcon was a nasurai popularion flucruasronz“ He re»
plied rhas rhe peregrine falcon was never as any rimc in danger Ofextinctian.

A review ofshc recens hisrory ofDDT and peregrine falcons is in order.
Peregrine falcons are cosmopoliran birds rhai can live in many environmenrs,
ranging from ihe Ascsic rundra ro modern ciries (Dunlap 1981). Peregrines
feed on a wide variesy orprey, especially birds. They were once famed among
ecologrsss because ofrheir remarkably ssablc populasions, rhoughr so be rhe
resulr ofsheir ﬂexible dict: "she general ssabrliry ofperegrine popularions—
as leasr in rhe Temperare Zonc‘has been an impressive characrerisric so
ecoiogisrs" (Hickey and Anderson l969). However, in she lare hfrics and

~early sirsies many people rhroughour ihe world became concerned abous

peregrine populaiions. in brirain, peregrines were failing ro reproduce, ihe
failures closely rclatcd in lime and space 10 DDT ircnrmcnis (Raicliffc 1963),
in North America in 1964,21 survcy of153 known hrccding ncsts from Geor-
gia ro Nova Scoria failed so discover a single fledgling (Berger er al 1969). Ar
ibis pornr, DDT was a prime suspecr, bur is had nor been demonsrrared rhar
ii was causing ihe breeding failures (Dunlap 1981). Further research was
necessary.

DDT was iirsr used extensively immediarcly arrcr qu. 1n Drirish srudies
ofcgg rliickness, ir was found shar museum specimen peregrine eggs from
baforc1947 had signiﬁcantly thicker shells than afrcr1947(Rnicliffc 1963).
The same significanr srend was deinonsrrared for N. American peregrines
(Hickey and Rocllc 1959). Research also found a ssrong inverse relarionship
bcrween herring gull egg shell rhickncss and DDE concenrrariou in rhe eggs
(DDE is a long lived DDT derivative). The probability that [he corrclzrion
was due (0 chance ix less than 1 in 1,000 (Hickey and Rocllc 1969). In
anorhcr ssudy, American spusrowhawks (closely relased (o peregrines) were
fed small amounis ofDDT in rheir dress and compared so a conrrol group.
The DDT in she dies creased an average concenrrarion of iSppm in she
birdS’ visceral far and caused signiﬁcansly shinnershells and lower reproduc-
rive success (Dunlap 1981),

Anorher ssudy in Quebec showed rhas peregrine falcons snrdied had in-
rernal conccnsrarions of 13 ppm DDE and laid eggs wirlr shells 21% rhinner
rhan normal (Brown 1978). in California, residues ofDDE in eggs was as
high as looppm, and eggs cxhibircd rip so a 53% decline in shell rlrickncss
(Brown 1978). These and many orher srudics presenred a srrong line ofcvis
dcncc ilinr DDT, in panlcular iiS dcrivniive DDE, was responsible for the
reproducrrve failure of peregrine falcons, This research led she us ro ban
mosr uses ofDDT in 1972 (Dunlap 1981). By rhis rrme, peregrine and bald
eagle populaiions had declined enough in ihe US :0 be lrsred as endangered

our all or a significanr porrion ofrrs range" (Mefrc and carroll 1997 p77).
Therefurc, [hc ESA and hundreds ofbiulogists involved in recovery efforts
would beg ro differwhen Avery claims rhas peregrine falcons were never in
danger ofcxililcrinll. The recovery of bald eagles and peregrrnes following
rhc DDT ban is impressive, Reccnrly, rhe bald eagle was removed from ihe
endangered species has, and she peregrine falcon is erpecied ro follow suir

wirhrn a year (Williams 1998), Mr. Avery is a remarkable man because he is
able To deliver urser lies in a supremely confident manner. Perhaps is is his
unwavering farrh rn pessicides rhas allows him so do so. He preys on igno.
rance. Many people have heard rhas DDT caused severe bird popularion
declines years ago, bur many may nor have wimessed is firsshand or read ihe
primary evidence in screnrihc journals.

Therefore, when Mr. Avery dogmasicaily asserrs rhar no dirccs evidence
of DDT influenced popularion declines errisss, many people are rempred io
believe him, or are as leasr uncerrain how so challenge him. indeed, many
srudenrs or she luncheon were silenr and one srudcnr aciiveiy came ro Mr.
Avery's supporr when i ouesrioned his sraremenss abous DDT. iris hearrcn—
ing, rhough, how easy ir is re expose his missraremenrs, All 1 had so do was
rype “su: DDT" on basicbiosis, and i was inundared wish hundreds ofrcferr
cnces for scicnillic arrrcles documenring she environmenral effecrs ofDDT.

iris also inrporranr ro remember rhas much ofshis debare, forall ihe facrs
and research, comes down so values, Do we believe in “she JudeoChrisrian
asserrion rhas God gave man ‘domlniun’ over ihe orhcr species ofrhe earrh"
as Mr. Avcry’s argumenss’ do? or do we quesrion “wherher any civiiizarion
can wage relenrless war on life wishour desrroying irself, and wishour losing
she righr so be called civilized," as Rachel Carson did in Silcnr Spring? ifwe
believe she former, siren we wrll lrkeiy supporr she widespread, unregulaied
use ofmany pesricides ifwe believe she larser, rhen we will suppors she use
ofmorc srisrainablc means so feed ihe world. Lass week, I asscrred rhar rhosc
who dumped rhc pic on Mr. Avery‘s head believed rhar she end goal ofsaving
rhe Ear-sh )rrsrihed rheir assaulr. ironically, Mr, Avery has much in common
wish rhe man who delivered she pie. He jusrifres rhe unregulared use of
deadly poisons wrrh rhe end goal ofsaving she planes in mind. Lasr weeki
orrorcd Marrrn Luiher King Jr.'s response so rhese rypes ofargumenrs, and i
rhink ii is worsh repcaring, Dr. King said shar we muss rejecr “any orher
sysrem rhas would argue rhar ihe end iusrines she means. For in she long
run, we muss see rhas she end reprcscnrs she means in process and she ideal
in she making, ,ihe philosophy of nonviolcnr resisrance is she philosophy
which says rhas rhe means musr be as prrre as she end, rhar in rhe long run of
hisrory, immoral desrrucrive means cannos bring abous moral and consrruc-
sive ends."
