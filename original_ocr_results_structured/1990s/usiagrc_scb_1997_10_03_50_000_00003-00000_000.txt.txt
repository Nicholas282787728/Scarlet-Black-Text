grad breeds

a new “Species”

BY CHRIS NEARY
Slaff Writer

The first student theatrical producz
lieu of the year, Sibling Species, will
rult October 2 to the 5 at Flanagan
Arena Theater. The play, which was
written and directed by Grinnell
graduate Rachel Slavick, is, as the
name hints, anything but convene
“Until. The play was written using
actors’ contributions made during
auditions and improvisational ses-
sions, a style which Slavick has
worked Willi in the past.

“It has become a subzspeeialty.
Usually [just write the plays, but as
a director I came into it With cenain
ideas about which wayslmight want
to go Ihad images , but nothing was
written until rchearsals,"said Slavick.

While Slavxek did not complete
the script until well into the rehearsal
dates, the script utilizes much ofwhat
happened during those rehearsal days
as dialogue.

“Actually, much of what became
the script was inspired by auditions.
Certain people did things, and char-
acters just popped into my head. In
some cases what happened in re-
hearsals became part of the script
directly."

In addition to rehearsals, cast im-
provisations were also used in the
creation ofthe Sibling Specie: script.
Donovan Sherman, who is part ofthe
seven member cast of Sibling Spe-
riei, is hoping the audience will ap-
preciate the difference between Sib-
ling Species and traditional plays,

“I think encouraging improvisa-
tion was definitely effective, I hope
the audience will notice the differ—
cues between this play and one based
on a traditional script. The cast has
created something light, because they
were responsible for the brainstorm-
ing in the play. It works well because
with an ensemble cast because there
me no leads. Everyone is a pan ofa

Stage manager for the play.
Genevieve Dawson, has seen the play
come together recently from its
sparse beginnings.

“There was nothing on the first
day. The director wanted to see what
the actors were doing, and then use
their talents in the script. Like most
plays it has really come togetherdur-
ing the last few days," said Dawson.

Slavick feels the administration
opted this kind of non-conventional
play because the student-actors are
allowed to take an active role in the
creation of the play.

“I think the faculty felt that it
would be interesting for the students
to perform in something that was
bent of their own work. Because they
help create the play it is more tailored
to them; they own it more. That al-
lows the cast more intimacy with
their characters."

Though the style of the play lends
itself towards a less traditional for-
mat, Slavick hopes that the audience
will not feel excluded.

“It's not linear, thought there is a
story. It’s not so obscure that it‘s im-
penetrable, I think the audience will
deﬁnitely have something to hang
onto. The world created on stage is a
theatrical one, not an imitation of
reality,” said Slavick,

Unfortunately. naming a non-lin-
ear play that is written during re-
hearsals can be tricky, so Slavick
turned to research she had done prior
to the play as inspiration {or the name
“Sibling Species." '

"I liked the sound of the words
together when I read them. I don‘t
know if they directly tie in with what
goes on in the play, but the audience
can decide that for themselves. Dif-
ferent people have different percep—
lions."

Admission to the play, which will
appropriately run during Family
Weekend, while the families of many
students are present. is free.
