Theater D_ep

by Susan MCBurney

in full fall fashion, Roberts and
Flanagan theaters are undergoing quite
a few changes, This is the result ofa
combined effort directed by Pip Gor-
don. Grinncll's theater technical die
rector and deSigner, the theater staff,
students and Facilities Management
to draw in the campus community to
the theater and to give it a more pro
fessional color.

The most obvious alterations are
those to the exterior of Roberts. Ac»
cording to Gordon. "The theater
doesn'tstartwiththecunainopening;
it should start the moment you park
your car. Entryways and lobbies be»
come a part of the event." Following
this concept, new racks for bicycles
have been installed to stop students
from parking them inside the lobby
area. The groundskeepcrs have
planted ﬂower gardens of Chrysan-
themums and impatiens along the
walkways leading up to the theater
giving the entire building an air of
“respectability."

The lobby area itself is undergo-
ing an adjustment as well. Gordon
concedes that the lobby is a passage-
way. but doesn’t believe that it must
look like one. “I want people to realr
ize that there is a theater there!” she
exclaims proudly. One effort to at-
tract attention is the striking, fullv
window silk paintings by Kaoime
Malloy hung to publicize next
weekend’sproductionofEillytheKld.
Gordon wants to start regularly using
this type of display for heralding the-
atcr productions. in November,

artment gives Roberts and Flanagan more class

Malloy will conduct a workshop for
students on understanding and pro-
ducing this kind of fiber art. Across
from Lhepatntings, plush vclvctropcs
frame the entryway to Roberts. The
door has a new coat of paint and the
few shabby remaining letters that once
spelled Roberts Theater are gone.
Gordon plans to top off the new
entryway with a marquee for the up
coming shows.

The changes are not just cos-
metic. inside these doors, theatergoers
will find the new box office which
replaces the Forum as the place to
pickuptickets.Bymakingthischange
of location, the Theater Department
has more control over the process
and onceagain. is betierable to make
people feel like they are a part of a
distinct experience. The more conve-
nient ticket policy allows students to
pick up more than one ticket per
show and to make reservations in
advance. In the spirit of professional
theaters, the box office will have a
marbleized counter. classy lighting
fixtures. artwork and design models
from current shows.

Gordon expects to have both the
lobby and box office completed by
Opening night of Billy the Kid. The
audience will literally be honored
with the red carpet treaunent, as Fa-
cilities Management has donated a
carpet to spread across the lobby dur-
ing shows. As a part of their class
requisites, students from the acting
class will be ready to perform as
ushers and house managers. They
will also serve coffee and other re-
freshments in the lobby after the per-

At RUSH

formances, as is traditional for major
events. The department plans to cel»
ebratc opening night with a formal
reception in theircontinuing effort to
“bring decorum and protocol back to
the theater," says Gordon.

Other changes are noticeable to
the students who work in the depart-
ment: a new lighting storage facility
above tthoberts stage, a new wood
floor in Flanagan, and the intensive
recycling program, The former floor
in Flanagan was concrete and very
hard on actors’ knees and Black Box
lovers’ bottoms. Now the stage. pri-
marily builtby Erik Sanningover the
summer, is raised soparts ofthe floor
canbcremovcd ifnccessary,making
it poSSible to screw things down se—
curely into the ﬂoor.

For obvious economic reasons,
the departmentalready tends to reuse
equipment (lumber, hardware, props,
etc.) as much as possible. Gordon
says the department also mes to
recycle the things that can't be re-
used. Stripped nuts and bolts, bent
nails and the like are sorted and
melded down to scrap metal. Worn

sized pieces. (People can pick up this
free firewood from the scene shop.)
“Theaterproducesa lot of trash; that’s
the nature ofthebusiness. We still try
tokeepas muchoutofourlandfillsas
we can," says Gordon.

The Theater Department’s price
tag for these changes was approxiv
mately $3000, not including expenses
incurred by Facilities Management
or the cost of needed safety gear
supplied by the Dean’s office. When

asked what improvemcns shcwould
make With an unlimited budget, Gor-
don luughingly replies, “Blow up
Roberts theater.” Then. more scri-
ously. she explains. “It is very diffie
cult and expensive to make improve
ments on a facility tha 's so funda-
mentally anuaheater: it is better to
start from scratch." Quite a bit of
energy by actorsand stagehandsalike
is expended in compensating for
Robcris’ inadequacies, For example,
it takes much less time for a stage
handtoriglightingonamobilebaton
than by ladder, as is necessary in
Roberts, and Roberts’ horizontal de-
sign and lessrthan-ideal acoustics is
quite physically demanding of the
performers. Gordon believes that
because the quality of the Final prod-

uct ofGrinneil theater productions is
so high. many people forget how
many disadvantages actors andstagce
hands must overcome. But Gordon
assures, “We’re doing what we can
With what we have at the moment.“
This optimisticoutlook is whatmakes
the renovations a success.

There was a time when going to
the theater wasanextraordinary event
on par with Waltz. It was the escape
from the routine of everyday life into
a completely different world. Robe

breeds this enchantmenL With a glint

end of the experience she hopes the
audience can say, “They had 3 won—
derful night out at the theater from
beginning to end.”

Bugsy is Hollywood gloss

by Brett Fechheimer

Starring Warren Beatty in the
title role, Bugsy is a glossedrover
look at the realelife, cold-blooded
mobster ‘Eugsy’ Siegel. An East
Coast gangster, Siegel is widely con-
sidered to be the “father of Las Ve-
gas.” Yet, in this ﬁlm. Siegel isa few
things the real man never was: glame
orous and charming, to name two.

Taken on its own merits, Bugsy
is a mildly entertaining film. It has a
pleasant 40‘s feel to it, and its two
leading characters (Annette Bening
plays S iegel ’ s mistress Virginia Hill)
are both delightful physical speci-
mens.

And, although the plot becomes
repetitive by the movie’s midpoint

(onecari takeonlysomuchofEeatty‘s
wry smileand the cool way he threat»
ens people), the expensive sets and
cinematography sometimes come
close to making up for this obvious
defect. Unfortunately. however.
Beatty’s acting is surprisingly
wooden—he lacks the spunk evident
in his earlier films.

As history, though, this movie
sucks. The real Siegel was a mthless,
vicious killer—not the winking,
Horatio Algereesque lunk played by
Beatty. Bugsy is a prime exampleof
how recent Hollywood movies have
put a gloss over historical events.
The gritty realism of Beatty’s earlier
films like Bonnie and Clyde, is no-
where to be found here.
