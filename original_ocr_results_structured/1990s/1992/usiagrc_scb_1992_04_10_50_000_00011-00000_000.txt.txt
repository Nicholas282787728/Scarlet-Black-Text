Men's track takes
fifth in relays

by Jessica Henry

The Grinnell College men‘s track
team began theoutdoor season with a
ﬁfth~plaee finish at the Norse Relays
at Luther. Central led the team scor-
ing, heading 3 ﬁeld of 11 with 1135
points. Next week the team will run
at the State meet, held at Central
College.

Coach Will Freeman said that he
was very pleased with the results,
The meet had a relay format which
puts less pressure on the athletes than
individual events. Italso allowed the
runners, mainly the distance crew, to
run relays that are not usually fea-
tured at track competitions.

The biggest surprise was the ﬁrst-
place finish of the 4X200M relay
team. Afteraninjuryin the4X100M,
Matt Sehragcr was unable to compete
so Tony Perez took his position. Fol-
lowing Perez were Chad Folsom, Rob
