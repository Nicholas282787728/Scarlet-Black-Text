COMMON SENSE

by Mike Washburn

in an essay in The Nation. David
Stannard denounces celebrations of the
500th armiversary ofColumbus's arrival
on this continent. These celebrations. he
admonishcs. are offensive to Indians.
stannard moreover. impliesihe has not
the eiirontcry to stategthatArnerica was
a better place before Columbus.

Starmardisrpeculiarlyfeverishvic-
Lim of the disease cfpolilichl fanaticism.
So determined is he to advance his sectar-
ian agenda that he descends to mendacity
when he believes itwill help him advance
it. Thus he implicitly denies certain facts
of lndian society.

As Paul Johnson notes in his fine
book. TheBt'rlh afthe Modem, the Creek
lndiaris were scarcely the peaceful and
decent peopleofliberal mythology.They
raided settler towns. cutting open preg-
nant women and gleefully tearing out the
fetuses (p. 29). It is fortunate that Andrew
Jackson put them down in the war of
1312. for their chiefTecurriseh had urged
them to kill all whites, animating tltem by
crying. “War now! War alwaysl War on
the living! War on the dead!" (p.23)

Liberal “historians" like Stannard
make much of the hostility of the white
settlers to peoples who werenot like them.
They ignore the tn'balviolence thatmarked
the tridian world for centuries. Eeoaying
a propensity for what the Serbs today
rnightcall"u‘iba.l cleansing." the lroquois
butchered an entire enemy tribe. the Illi-
nois. They also wiped out a good number
of the Huron and drove the rugged re
mainder into the wilds ofCanada.

Sadly. the work ofStannard is more
likely to win popular esteem than that of
Johnson. or that of Francis Parkman. an»
orhereloquentchronicleroflndiancrimes.
There's a mania these days for boosting
the "selfresteem" ofminorities by giving
them a sugary therapy that is digniﬁod as
“history." To contradict the therapy is
corisidercdracist Mylasrcolunui. which
addressed some of the problems oiblack
Africa, provoked a furiousresponsc from
somebody named l’apa Owusu. In the
course of his semiliterate tirade Owusu
accused me of launching “a viruperative
war ofwords"(tis opposed to a genial war
of words?) againstblacks.

Alexander Pope wrote of his en.
emies that they were like “longencclt
bottles: the less they have in them. the
more noise they make pouring it out."
Owusushrieks that we cannot judge black
Africa by its dictators unless we also
judge Europe by its despois. and that we
are silly to dwell on female circumcision
in Abrica since whites have sexual per-
versions.

It is the misfortune of women in
regions of black Africa that there is in
those regions a recognized carmmofcutr
Ling off their clitorises forcibly and with-
out their consent. Althouyi there is rape
in white countries. no one cxceptpcrhaps
for Andrea Dworkin believes that it is
widely condoned. and there are laws
against it. Moreover, women in black
Africa do not enjoy the some political
iights as women in the Wesribut then.
outside of a few elite cliques there aren't
many people in black Africa who have
political power in any real form.

It is incontcsiublc that some of
history‘s most detestable dictators have

been European. But Europe has also had
great democratic rulers. Disraelis and
ChurchillsandBrandtsrThe dictators have
counterparts in black Africa; the demon
cratic rulers do not. Wherem democracy
has existed in Europe for many decades.
in black Africa it is not yet come into
being. Angola will havcits ﬁrsrretllelccr
lion this year.

The facile explanation for the Euro
poun expansion into Africa is that the
natives of the continent offered a source
of cheap labor. Although some of the
Europeans who entered Africa did so to
acquire cheap labor. othcrs merely wanted
tosuppressthe Barbaiypirateswho harla
base of operations in Africa. or to bring
civilization to what they correctly saw as
abackwards and barbaricptirtofthe world.

it's tempting to blame the region's
hunger on colonialism. but no real histoe
rian would do so. In Suicide ofthe West,
James Bumham recounts that when the
British first vennired into Kenya they
found the land sterile. ”cropped down to
bare soi by cattle and horses kept to
expand a u'ibc's prestige and status rather
than its food supply" (p. 17). Through
Herculean efforts. the British made the
land fenile and arable; then they set up
farms which grew to be among the finest
in theworld. Butwhen dccolomzation got
underway. the Bntons' “highly produc-
tive, technically advanced and efficiently
managed farms [were] broken up into
subsistence plots or small uneconomic
units, both types largely in the hands of
mcompetertt Negroes" (p. 117).

Even DesmondTulu. who. like many
other black public figures. has made a
career out of exploiting white guilt. as
serled that the. blacks ofALrica are worse
off under black rule than they were under
Colonialism.

The black president of the Ivory
Coast Felix»HoupouetBoigny.atamcet-
ing of the Organization ofAfrican Unity.
expressed his regret that there were only
a few thousand Frenchmen inhis country.
He told the other leaders present. “In ten
years i hope that there will be 100.000
Frenchmen [in the Ivory Coast]. And l
would like at that time forus to meetagain
and compare the UCOnOl’TUC strength of
your countries with minc.ButI fear. dear
colleagues. that few of you will be in a
posi on to attend." (Paul Johnson. Made
em Tim. p. 527)

The hunger that followed the Euro
peans' departure was no more their fault
than that which preceded their arrival.
When they came famine had long been a
principal feature of black Africa along
with tribal slaughter, slavery, genocide.
and despotism.

So what? asks Owusu. Don't these
things plague Europe too? They certainly
do; but Europe hasiil is the birthplace
oi—democracy and the rule of law. As
the liberal historian Arthur Schll: 'nger.
lr. reminds his readers in The Disuru'tirtg
of America, these are “uniquely Euro-
pean" instilutioris.not“Asian. or African.
orNative Americanexceptby adoption.“
Black Africa cenainly hasn't made con-
tributions at all comparable to those of
Europe. which much of the World is now
beginning to adopt.

Owusu asseru that in my column I
“argued that blacks are inferior. citing
low academic achievement." That isn't
true. Owusu made it up,
