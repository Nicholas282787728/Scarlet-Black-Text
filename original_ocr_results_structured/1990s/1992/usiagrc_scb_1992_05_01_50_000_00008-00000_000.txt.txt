by C06, 1 9- 1 6

By Jason Wolf

"We have a lack of concentration
on defense and ineptness on offense,
and those twoadded up make for long
days," said baseball coach PattFoster
after his team dropped three games
over the weekend to Knox,
Monmouth, and Illinois Colleges.

”l'hreedayslater.thePioneersbroke
out of their hitting slump, scoring
sixteen runs in the second game of a
doubleheader against the Coe Col-
lege Kohawks. The surge of runs
followed the first game, which Grin-
nell lost, 138.

Despite the efforts of starting
pitcher Ian Carlson, Grinnell was a
victim of the ten»run mercy rule for
the second straight game.

Sophomore shortstop Justin
Hupfer provided the only positive
note of the game when he hit a 350
foot homenm over the centerﬁeld
fence.

In the second game, Grinnell ex-
ploded for eight runs in the ﬁrst in
ning. Unfortunately, the Kohawks
came roaring back and scored six
runs in their half of the inning.

offensively, the game had several

highlights. Sophomore Chris
Hutchinson, making a rare start at
catcher, led the Pioneers with four
clutch hits and threw out a Coe run-
ner trying at second base in the sixth
inning. It was the first Lime this
season that Hutchinson, who is usu»
ally the team's designated hitter, had
thrown out a baserunner. However,
he still managed to make the play
look easy, rifling the throw to l-lupfer
just in time to nail the runner.

Another key performer for the Pier
neers was first baseman Landon
Boyer,who hadfour hits. Boyer. who
smashed the Grinnell College record
for putouts in a swon last weekend,
continued his masterful play both on
offense and defense against Coe.

Junior Mark Lehmann, who was
thesecond pitcher tocomeonin relief
of I-Iupfer, came through with a cru—
cial one out. hit and run single that
knocked in a Grinnell run. Lehmann
later suffered for his efforts, getting
beaned on the hand by a thrown ball
and tearing up his knee while sliding
into third base.

The junior co-captain was less than
impressed with the team‘s perfor-
mance. ”As well as the practices have

been going this week, I'm surprised
thatthegamedidn'tgobetter,"he said
after the game, echoing the sentia
merits of his teammates.

Despite the impressive offensrve
showing, the game was still lost by
the Pioneers. A Slew of relievers.
including senior co-eaptain Steve
Johnston, Lehmann. and sophomore
Dave Stewart. followed l-Iupfcr, but
they could notslow down the Kohawk
bats.

ThedebaclesagainstCoefollowctl
a weekend in which the Pioneers got
eleven hits and scored three runs in
three games over the weekend. De-
spite the lack of hitting, Grinnell still
had several opportunities to score
runs. They had the bases loaded five
different times in the two games Sat-
urday, yet failed to score each time.

Analyzing the team‘s season, Fos-
ter said it has had "two strange parts.
First. we had no pitching and no hit-
ting. Now, we have good pitching
and no hitting,and wearerunningout
of time to put the two together."

Softball team wins ﬁrst
game of the season

By Alex Severens

It was late in the season before
they foundﬂteirmagic,butlastSatur—
day. the Grinnell women‘s softball
team did come up with the necessary
hitting and pitching to post their ﬁrst
win of the year. They used a new
practice technique on the Friday be-
fore the Monmouth game, and now
they wish they had discovered the
new method earlier in the year,

Behind the bat of senior Terra
Geiger and the arm of junior Tera
Jones, the Pioneers dominated the
first game of the double header with
Monmouth, roughing up Monmouth,
3-0, Monmouth recovered in the sec-
ond game, putting Grinnell away. 7-
2.

In the ﬁrst victory of the year,
Jones registered the first victory of
her pitching career. She bafﬂed the
Monmouth batters, scattering four hits
andstn'king outthree.Shealsohelped
her own cause by going two for three
at the plate and one RBI.

TheotherTerra,Terra Geiger, was
the offensive story of the weekend. In
the two games, the senior catcher
went six for seven with three doubles
anda triple. Shealso scored all fiveof
the Pioneer runs in the two games.

Unfortunately there was a down
side to the shutout victory. Freshman

Katie Somer was rounding second
base on a routine play when her leg
gave out from under her as her lower
leg snapped. She had to stay in Illi-
nois to have surgery on the leg.

The new praetice technique—
which appeared to work well—was
designed by the two Terra's. Before
their normal Friday afternoon prace
tice, each one of the playerswas taken
into Coach Sadewater’s office and
‘done up' for practice. Inateam moral
boosting exercise, everyone went
through the practice with bows in
their hair and gaudy make-up on their
face. Strange things can be known to
motivate a team.

The women wish they had discov-
ered the miracles of make up earlier
in the week when the visited Illinois
College. The team was in trouble
before tltc games even started, as two
key starters did not make the trip.
Coach Sadewater pointed out how
inexperienced the team wasnormally,
and the absence of the two principle
members was especially evident.

In the first game, Tera Jones was
on the mound. and despite a fine
performanceon her part. thoPtonccrs
fell,13»2.The second gamedid notgo
well at all for the Pioneers and they
were happy to escape with their lives
aslllinoispoundedouta33-5 victory.

Monday at home was the last date

forthePioneers and they hoped to get
their second victory of the yearagainst
a strong Upper Iowa team. Seniors
Maude logsdon, Stef Reisdorf, and
Terra Geiger took their positions for
the final time, but the team could not
generate the offense to win. Both
games were ten run losses for the
home team.

While the one victory season was
cenainlynotamemorableonein terms
of win-loss percentage, Coach
Sadewater had this to say of the team
effort. “I want everyone on this team
to know that I respect them for sticky
ing together an playing tough, even
when things were going poorly. My
job asa ﬁrst yearcoach with an “1ch
perienced team was made much easier
by the great group I had to work wim.
They came out ready to play at every
practice and every game—that‘s all I
can ask.”

Tera Jones had this to say of the
year‘s efforts: “Despite the record, I
thought it was great how the team
stuck together. Everyone was always
there in each and every game."
