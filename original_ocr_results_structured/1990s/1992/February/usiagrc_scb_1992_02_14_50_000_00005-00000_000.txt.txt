GRINNELL STUDENTS REVIEW FERGUSON

By Sharyn Obsatz

“What has she done? I don’t
know.”“l’vc nevcrseen heraround.”

What do Grinnell students think
about their new president? A recent
Quad Poll by Shelly West shows that
13.9% of students think President
Ferguson is doing a good job, 12.9
percent think shedoing abadjob, and
an overwhelming 73.2% don't know.
Interviews with 47 students selected
randomly at the dining halls and the
Forum, resulting in quotes such as
those above. revealed that most. stu-
dents feel they do not know their
president.

There is an “ambiguous climate
on campus," explained one student.
Students, feeling out of touch wuh
Pamela Ferguson and uncertainabout
the president's goals and actions,
speculate on whether she is “shy,”
“reserved," ”uptight," “aloof.“ “a
puppet,” “a figure-head," or even,
according to one student. potentially
a Clarence Thomas installed by the
Trustees as a token woman.

“I don’t feel like I know who she
is, what shedoes, if she givesadamn,"
said one student interviewed. Nobody
has any clue about what she’s doing,
asserted another.

“What does she mean when she
says “multiculturalism"? I haven’t
seen her do anything about this. It‘s
all talk and no action,” one student
said. “Has she done anything we
should know about?" asked another.

Many students said they have had
few opportunities to learn more about
the president. “I went to hear her talk
as a candidate." explained one stu-
dent, describing all she knew about
Ferguson. Another remembers see-
ing her at an ice cream social during
New StudentDays last semester. One
student said he and his friends sent
her a computer message inviting her
forhotcocoaand shedid notrespontl.

“I don’t see her make eye contact
wtth students," complained another

student. “She’s yet to show herself
forwho sheis. The only thing people
have seen from her is that piece of
paper in their mailbox,” he added.
referring to her letter to students after
the first swastika harassments last
semester.

“I've never met her." said one stu—
dent. “I don’t know how I'd even go
about seeing her
if i had to,“ said
another.

don't think ad-

the only part of
the president’s
job. She is sup-
posed to be in
touch with fac-
ulty and stu-
dents,” said one
respondent. ”It’s

to be someone
that students
don’t feel they
know,” said any
other.“Shehasan
opportunity at a
small school like
this to be part of
the community,”
said a third re-
spondent.

Several stu-
dents also said
she has a responsibility to make her
views known to the student body.
“She needs to voice an opinion on
something," said one student. “I’d
like to see that she really has a setof
values,” assencd another.

“I don‘t know what her duties are,”
said one student. “I don’t really know
what issues would go past her. I don’t

know what she intends to deal with
directly.“ said another.

One student disagreed with the
idea of a president responsible to the
students, stating he had heard that the
president’s main goal is raising
money. How closely the president
knows the students on campus is
merely a difference in style, he rear

soned—herstyle is justmore detached
than that of George Drake.

Some students said Ferguson’s
newness on campus explains her per-
ceived inactivity and lack of contact
with students. She’s only been here a
semester, they argued, ”it's too early
for us to decide anything about her.”

“You can’t expect her to change
the whole operation of the college in
fourteen weeks," said one student.

Six of the 47 students made posi-
tive statements about President
Ferguson’s performance.

“She’sprettyopentomeeungwith
students. Anybody can make an ap-
pointment to meet with her...She’s
doing as much as she can. lfeel it’s
going to takea while for her to warm
up to campus, and it‘s going to take a

while fortheeam—

her.She'sjustget—
ting her feet wet,"
cxplaincdonestur
dent, adding that
George Drake‘s
first two years at
Grinnell were “re-
ally hard." “After
a while she’ll be

sertive with

student.
Another
student described
P r e s i d e n t
Ferguson as“very
approachable,”
“very open to
building better
ways of commu-
nication," very
ready to listen to
what you want."
and “much easier
to talk to than
George Drake.“
“I think
shedoestrytoﬁnd
out what’s going
on with students," said a third stu—
dent, citing President Ferguson's at-
tendance at speeches and speculating
that Ferguson probably talks to Stu-
dent Affairs to find out how students
feel aboutcerlain issues. “I think last
semester would have been a llttle
early for her to be making changes.
l’d hate for her to make mistakes,"
said this student. However, she added
that she'd now like to see Fergilson

take “a more public role."

Lastly, one student said President
Ferguson is probably better than the
presidents of most other schools.

Stutlentsintervieweddidoffersugv
gestions about how Pamela Ferguson
could improve relations with them.
These included talking to the per-
formers after the shows she attends,
going to basketball games and stay-
ing afterwards to talk to students.
occasionallyeatingin thedining halls,
spending time at the Fonirn, holding
weekly office hours open speciﬁcally
to students, sending outa brief news»
letter, and writing a column in the
Scarlet and Block. They also sug-
gested she hold open fomms, initiate
more student surveys such as the one
on multiculturalism, and “make sure
student organizations are communi-
cating with herand sending her infor-
mation" on their activities.

Concerns these studean want the
president to address include: deﬁn—
ing what she means by
multiculturalism and what she plans
to do about it, recmiting more stu-
dents and faculty of ethnic minori-
ties. and reacting more vocally to the
continuation of the swastika incidents.

Many students feel Ferguson
should devote more attention to the
art departments. Several complained
about the current Fine Ans building,
the limited class offerings which omit
art forms such as film, the inability to
practice music due to the constant
interference of sounds from non-
soundproof classrooms nearby, the
headaches suffered during ceramics
classes in rooms where acid must be
stored due to lack of space, and the
lack of funding for choir tours in
comparison to sports team tours.

“She needs to direct more. There’s
no direction from the top that the arts
are important,” one student said.

Students also wantto seeimprove-
merits in academic departments which
appear to be falling apart (one student
mentioned the History and Political
Science Departments), the hiring of
professors who will stay longer at
Grinnell, thccnd of the overcrowding
in the classroom which causes sec-
ond»semester seniors to be closed out
of classes, and improved campus se-
curity though more lighting and con-
tinued support for victims of harass-
ment.

Whatever theirconcems. most stu-
dents are anxious for some action
from their college’s president.

“I think one semester is enough to
sit back and get a feeling for the
campus,” said one student.

Presrdent Ferguson argued in her
Convocation speech at the beginning
oflastsemesterthat“the collegemust
be student-centered.“ It appears that
students at Grinnell desire closer ties
with their president.
