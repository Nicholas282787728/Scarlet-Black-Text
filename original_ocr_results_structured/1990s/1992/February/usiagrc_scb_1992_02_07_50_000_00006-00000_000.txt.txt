Won‘t you be our neighbor? LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Concrete cinder blocks, linoleum ﬂoors and florescent lights tower-ing
twenty stories into the cloudy sky. You don’tknow your neighbor, much less
theguy downstairs,and the only thing you knowabout yourroommate isthat
he or she is from the east. Welcome to life at your state university of choice.

Now pan back to graceful Grinnell. Trees sway gracefully to and fro in
front of low brick residences. A frisbee ﬂoats past. You know the name,
birthplace and social security number of everyone on your floor.

But does anyone think things are this rosy? Do we really know the people
we live with all that well? Grinnell has been pondering this a lot lately and
has decided that the current system of HACs should be scrapped.

Now obviously the hall relations around Grinnell aren'tas nonexistant as
the stereotypical state university; at a school with 1300 students. it would be
difﬁcultnottoknow at least someof the people you live with. There is asense
of disunity on this campus, however, and much of the ﬁnger pointing has
been directed at Hall Activities Coordinators

HACs have been blamed for not
bringing dorms together and for not
making enough activities for students
to get involved in. But the fact is the
HAC position should never havebeen

STAE E
expected to do eimer one of these. E D ITORIAL
HACs can, by deﬁnition, only orga»

nize activities. Their job istopromote don'n life through parties, study breaks
and other activities, but these actions alone are not enough to create a sense
of dorm unity or togetherness. There is no way for HACs to bring the dortn
together to deal with its problems and issues - these are currently only
handled by one person in each two dorms, the resident advisors. It‘sclearthat
all-campus parties and all-dorm study breaks aren’t enough to build the
feeling of community that we all want.

Under the council system, there would be a hall council consisting of the
student advisors, the hall Coordinator in the position of HAC, and an elected
president equivalent to current SGA senators

So you say to yourself, all these functions are currently taken care of by
the current system - there’s no need for change. The imponant pan of the
council system, however, is the ability of the hall to come together for more
thanjustjustparties and study breaks and to have a balance of programs that
actually dealswith what is affecting the entire dorm. These things were never
meant to be handled by the hall activities program, and the current system
leaves discussion entirely up to only one person per dorm, the resident
advisor. And in a system like that, how can we possibly expect dorrrr unity,
HACS or no HACS?

LARRY BRYAN: THE MAN
AND THE MYTH “It was exactly
like every other weekend ...bur noth-
ing was really out of the ordinary."—
Matt Stippich NOT! But wait a
minutcilet’s back up here. Was it
really like every other weekend? If
Matt and his friends think this was
like every other weekend (or rather,
every night, as it was in reality), then
it appears that they justify the after
hour consumption of Larry‘s profits.
(Whatever did happen to those extra
bottles of Jagermeister'!) But we can
see why Larry wouldn't get upset
about THAT And when money is
continuously missing from the regis-
ter after these types of beer drinking
bashes, why in theworldwould Larry
care?Itwasonlyseveral“SS."Maybe
Bob Reason was right (the only cor-
rectfactintheJanuary3lstarticle)—
the money stolen from The Bar fr-
nally gave Larry a concrete reason to
shut down the bar. In reality, perhaps
having astudcnrwho had been kicked
out of The Bar mixing drinks after
hours was common practice during
the months before The Bar closed.
Simply because many of these activi-
ties occurred every weekend by no
mms makes them ordinary or cor-
rect It simply makes them unaccept-
able. it is not very good business
practice to allow activities to con»
tinue that drain away proﬁts and in-

crease liability to the owner, Larry
had patiently tried to work out these
problems, but as he quoted to us,
“You can only get fucked over so
many times before you have to do
something about it." Why don’t you
figure it out: do you really think
Larry had nojustification for closing
The Bar? In actuality, itwas the only
think left for him to do. Furthermore,
yes, perhaps the closing of The Bar
has lead to more parties on campus,
and that’s a good thinggespecially
if you’re like Chris Maag who is
underage and has nowhere else to go.
Those of you who think you hold
economic power over Larry Bryan
should recall when you tried to boy-
cortTheBarJustlookwherethatgot
youiNOWlﬂSRE. The boycotting
of The Bar was Larry’s inspiration
for opening a new establishment
where only those over 21 could even
get in. The State Sumr Station is a
place where those activities which
were not“outofthe ordinary" at'l'he
Bar happen during business hours,
Ihuscuttingliabilitywhileatthesame
time providing fun for students as
well as the profit that Larry is en-
titled to. As we are good friends with
larry Bryan, we overheard him come
ment that the reason he refused an
interview with the Scarlet and Black
is that a wise man once told him
“You shouldn’t get in a pissing con-

Okay, so wonders will nevcrcease.
I have decided tojoin the ranks of thc
non-drinkers. After one weekend
spent completely sober and enjoying
myselftrcmcndously, l have decided
thatperhaps sobriety isn‘t such a curse.
i mean, after all, think of the things
you avoid when you don‘t drink.
Hangovers that keep you immobile
until at least 2 pm. the next day;
vomiting in/on other peoplc’s bath-
rooms;andtheevcr-popularsnogging
with weird people whom you nor»
mally wouldn’ttouch with a ten-foot
pole with a fifteen-foot extension on
it. Not that every drunken-Snogging
is bad, but sometimes you have to be
careful that it‘s notjust a case of beer
goggles Besides, if you’re sccn gate
ting chummy with someone while
eithcrofyou is in a drunken state, you
arcautomatically assumed to be sleep-
ing with that person on a regular ba-
sis. Oh, the wild, wacky world of the
Grinnell rumor mill.

Iages. Not that alcohol excuses any
of your (or my) stupid behavior, but
it's at least understood that anyone
under the inﬂuence is guaranteed to
do something stupid, so people are
generally more inclined to grant you
forgiveness. Unless you pukeintheir
bathtub, in which case, they're more
inclined to grant you a sponge and
some heavy»duty cleanser.

Also, alcohol loosens up certain

do you really think we’d "leak" that

To the editor

As noted in last weeks staff edito-
rial “Every Keg Has aSilvcrLining,"
the recent closing of the Bar has
brought about an obvious resurgence
in campus parties. As both a HAC
and a person who, well, likes to drink
beer, I am particularly happy about
this up side to the travesty of the Bar
closure. However, there is a definite.
though certainly not new, problem
that me editorial failed to address—
this “veritable convoy of kegs” which
has "hit campus lately has to be payed
for by somebody and, unfortunately,
not enough people are truly “paying
theirway."Don’rgermewrong,there
are certainly a majority of people
who give often and give generously
(as i learned lasr week) to those that
come collectingi even if they don’t
drink or won’t be attending the party.
That’s fantastic, and I certainly have
no problem with it, The people thatI
address this to, and you know who
you are, are those who givelittle or no
moncytoaparty,yetstillcomc,drink
15 cups of beer, and proceed to bitch
and moan when thckcg run out. Now,
if you can't afford to give to every
party that you go to, that‘s fine, i’m
not asking you to : however, if you
never give, yet still continue to come
to every party and behave the way I
described above, you‘re screwing us
all over, With beer getting more ex-
pensive, party organizers are fre-
quently losing moneyi this “promr
ising rebirth” of campus parties is
going to meet a rapid end unless par-
tresbecome affordable. Think of how
much you spentar the Bar, and com-
pare it to [he “price“ of a campus
party, and one dollar for pretty much
unlimited beer really shouldn‘t seem
all that painful a donation. The other
options: no parties at all, or perhaps
parties lrke those at most other, non-
spoiled, collcgcs4 private guest list,
5 dollars at the door. ken visre hac-
rawson hall p.s. how dare Bnrak (of
