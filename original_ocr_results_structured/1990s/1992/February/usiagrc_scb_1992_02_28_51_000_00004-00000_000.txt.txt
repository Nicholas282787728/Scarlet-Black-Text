PRESIDENTIAL INTERVIEWS
Wohlauer seeks open SGA;

Onwuachi offers new

energy, perspective

Whatmakesyou the mostqualitied
person to be SGA president?

I’d say that, first ofall, I‘m open-
minded, approachable, I‘m really
open to the differentpcrspectives that
students on campus represent, and I
equally respect all of their opinions.
I’m very hard working and I take my
work very seriously. I’m a good
leader, I have good speaking skills,
and good social skills as well. How-
ever, I think lltat my most important
attribute is that I am willing to lake
risks,andIhavenewenergy.Ihaven’t
been involved with SGA for a year,
getting my ideas stepped upon and
rejected. So, I will be a little more
idealisticandlwillbemore willingto
try new things.

What do you think are the main
issues facing SGA?

I see three primary issues facing
lheStudentGovemmentAssociation:
communication. stability in SGA and

townrgown relations.
First oi all, I feel ltke students are

unaware of what is happening and
what SGA is capable of doing on
campus. It seems like people only
come to SGA when they want money
for something. I would like to better
represent the students. I don’t think
that they are apathetic; it‘s just that
they are not aware of what SGA can
do. I hope to better that through peri»
odic open forums and by writings bi-
weekly column in the Scarlet and
Black,

I think that with all the problems
that have occured on campus this
year, it sseems that SGA needs to be
more stable. If I am elected, I will
choose cabinet ofﬁcers who will re-
main in office all year long, and not
people who are going to neglect their
responsibilities. I will only selecthard
workers.

Ibelieve that most people, includ-
ing my fellow candidates, would say
that safety is the most important issue
in terms oftown-gown relations. Cer-
tainly, the college is making a genu-
ineeffort to make the campus safer by
putting up more lights and installing
peepholes in doors. However, I feel
like no matter how many lights we
put up, how many peepholes we in-
stall, we’re still not going to be safe
on campus unless the town welcomes
us. We need town support so that the
next time a Grinnellian is attacked on
campus, the town is just as upset as
the students are. I think that we need
to take the first steps in improving
relations. Ifelected, I will attempt to

plan activities that involve both
Grinnell College and the town of
Grinnell.

ﬂow will your past contributions
help you?

I’d say that I have the experience
where itcounts. As a student adviser,
I've had experience taking student's
concerns to student affairs, resident
advisors, and the college administra
tion. As a member of the student staff
selection committee and the Commit
tee on student life, I have developed
contacts and relationships with some
of the college‘s top administrators.
So, I have contacts where it counts;
with people who have the closest ac-
cess to students and their concerns.

What does SGA lack that you can
provide?

SGA currently lacks new energy.With
all the changes happening on carn-
pus, especially with the hall councils,
the student government is going to
have to change to meet the needs of
the students. In other words. students

 

need someone who is not inclined to once was, so i think me largest prob-
do "MES ”10 01d Way. Also. I can lem on campus is the disquieting atv

bring a totally new perspective to
SGA as a black woman. Grinnell

College really needs someone like You think that students are a lot

me as their SGA president,

What do you feel makes you the
most qualiﬁed candidate for SGA
president?

Well, qualified—I would say I’ve
got the combination of both ideas and
I have sort of a strong sense that
things need to change around here,
that there’s gotta’ be some different
things done to make the campus life
better. I think that that‘s by far the
iargestproblem atGrinnell rightnow.
Sol feel thatI—I havestrong feelings
about whatneeds to be done, and I've
put thattogether with—I’ve also had
some handsron experience. I worked
forilast yearI was the SGA Con»
cerLs Committee Chairman and so I
havean ideaofhow thecabinetworks,
how SGA apparatus works, and have
sort of a working relationship with
members of the administration.

What do you foresee as the most
important issues facing SGA?

Well again I think that the most Imr
portant issue by far really is campus
life. I think the atmosphere that has
sort of begun to settle on campus this
year is‘is really unfortunate, and I
believe things should change, and
that things can change. It’s notw
things used to be different, things
used to be better. Campus life isn't
what it should be, and it's not what it

mosphere.

less happy?

I think —I do think students are
more unhappy now on both—I think
there’s less going on here socially.
There’s less dorm unity, which al-
ways is helpful for, especially for
younger students. When I was a first»
year student, that really made my
year and introduced me to some more
people, that is having a strong dorm,
unified dorm, gave me the opportu-
nity to meet new people. Sol would
say that students are less happy.

How will your past contributions
to the campus aid you in your role
as SGA president?

Well I‘d say again, I’ve had the
year experience on SGA, so from the
purely logistical poiniof view,I have
an idea how things work. But also;
well I‘d say that was it. I mean, more
importantly though, the issue now is
having someone with ideas, having
someone with experience Just as a
Grinnell college student. Having ideas
of how things used to be and how
things have changed for the worse in
my opinion. So I think the most Valu-
able qualification for a candidate
would be just someone who is in
touch with Grinnell and Grinnell stu~
dents.

What does SGA lack that you can
provide?

Well, I think SGA—what it lacks is
more—it needs to be more open and
friendly to the campus. I think that it
really means well, and that there re-

I just think that, for some reason,‘
there’s some obstacle between the.
student body and SGA, and I’m not

Ilook at the open forums not as the‘
