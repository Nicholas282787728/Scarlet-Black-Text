Another weekend wasted

‘ I‘m afraid there aren’t too many
deep droughts running around in my
head this week for me to share with
you. l'mjusttrying to getthrough the
next few days of catching up with
Work, organizations, and dirty laune
dry. You see, I went to a Conference
this weekend.

‘ Conferencesalwaysseemlikesuch
it good idea when you ﬁrsthear about
them. The opponunity to travel, to
meet new people, to listen to new
ideas they seem like an excellent ex-
cuse for a road trip and for the void
ance of all homework. After all, it‘s
hot like you go just to have fun or
anything. You go to learn something
and bring itback to campus. At least
that‘s whatyou tell SGA when you‘re
begging for the registration money.
, Just kidding, of course.

Anyway, I went to a conference
thisweekend.TheBisexual,Gay,and
Lesbian Awareness DaysatLawrence
University in Appleton, Wisconsin,
'to beexact. First of all, let me say that
despite my upcoming cynical tone,
the conference was well organized
and provided interesting workshops
and speakers. I was impressed with
the ﬂiers that had been sent out ear-
lier, the information packets that

Alana Walen

greeted trs upon arrival, and the
friendly cooperation of the President
of their gay group, Elise. She was so
friendly to talk to, I don’t remember
her last name.

Unfortunately,by Saturday noon I
was pretty much gayed out. You
know, when you’ve been thinking
and getting psyched about one par-
ticular cause until you reach a satura-
tion point, when you don’tcare ifyou
see another gay person as long as you
live. Ireached thatpointearly on, and
tried to think about other things.

Two fairly non-gay things stand
outin my mind. The first is my obserA
vationsaboutLawrence. Back in high
school I only visited one college be»
sides Grinnell, so I found the oppor-
tunity to explore another campus fas-
cinating. As one Appletonian put it,
they spendtheirmoney onartsy fartsy
shit instead of on a decent computer
system. The centerpiece of theircam-
pus wasathree yearold, Harris-Cen-
ter-esque Fine Arts complex, com
plete with large, yellow, twisted steel
that was to be considered art outside.

Overall, I liked the campus. It was
friendly enough, although I mustad-
mit that my basic suspicion of frater-
nities and sororities didn't allow me
to appreciate that panicular aspect of
Lawrence life.

The other thing that I really rev
member is how oddit was to meet the
parents of two Grinnell students. I
don’t know why, but I always expect
parents to be either incredibly hip and
cool, like theirkids, or kind ofdistant
and strange, like mine seem to be.
What I found was that both of these
noticeable students’ parents seemed
really — well, normal and nice. They
had beautiful houses and amusing
pictures of my friends as youngsters.
I guess parents always seem pretty
cool as long as they‘re not yours.

I did learn about gay stuff this
weekend too. But I don’t have the
enthusiasm that I used to have, the
purejoy ofmccting with lots ofother
gay people. Perhaps that mellowness
comes with age, or at least with the
con fidence that I‘ll always be able to
find a gay community whereever I
go. Right now, the task ofrecovcring
from the weekend and ﬁtting back
into my life seems much more immi-
nent.

 

:SCRATCHINGS OF AMAD MAN
Spontaneous Combustion

’ Iowa's fevered bureaucrats are go-
ing a little insane. Or at least one
group of them. While Iowa's fevered
legislators grapple with the deficit by
lining theirown pocketsand shouting
J'Screw you, taxpayetl",theStateFire
Marshal's office, not to be outdone,
has dictated that we must all replace
every surface of glass with something
,we can'tsee through. Well, notquite.
This rule that no one here at Grinnell
College had noticed is - any interior
glass surface that is on a firewall, not
a mirror and over 900 square inches
‘(or two—and-a-half—feet square) is
unsafe.

Not only that, but every glass cov-
ered opening on a given firewall
'should total no more than 900 inches.
.And, lcst thatnotbesufficient to keep
us safe from incineration in our beds
’at night, the fevered minds at the
sameoffice havecomeup with plenty
more rules since the college was last
(inspectcd for fire safety in 1985
{19857 - Christ, we were all still in
,middle schooll), varying from the
sublime to theritiiculous. Now,in the
‘afterrnath of the fire in Cleveland
.Hall (which, incidently, had nothing
to do with the subjects of the current
Troubles and was contained perfectly
well by what was there) a sweeping
,citation from the fire marshal has
resulted in the mandatory expendi-
'ture of $650,000 on compliance with
-no fewer than 150 campus-wide citar
_tions. It is a phenomenal sum of
money, equivalent to full fecs

It leaves not a stone unturned.
Doorstops, for example. We know
we all adore and misuse them, keep-

Not only doorstops are frowned
upon by the fire marshal. The
firestorm ofnew regulations since the

DINOSAUR DAYS

Hurrah for Uncle
Sam and aunt Gage

It’s times like these,..crack out
the General Foods International
Coffees. Friday’s New York Times
hadanarticlewhich warmedmyheart.
On January 30, in Pontiac, Michigan.
a judge ﬁnally exercised her power of
judgement in a sensible way. Judge
Hilda Gage knew how to deal with
Alexander Zelikov‘s speeding prob-
lem. Zelikov, a professional test
driver, had received so many speed-
ing tickets that he lost his license last
July. When he went into court, he
didn’t know what to expect. This
“menace to the county” (Judge Gage’ 3
assessment). who test drives cars for
the Dalkin Clutch Corporation (2 Sup
plierofmanual-transmissionclutches
to the Big Three and Foreign auto
makers) , just wanwd his license back.
Judge Gage gave him more than that

Oh and so much more. She came
up with a way to make Zelikov a hero
of die country—— a true patriot. And
how? Through community service?
Driving elderly ladies to the grocery
store perhaps? Maybe bringing glass
botdes to the recyciing center. Or
going from high school tohigh school
telling kids not to speed (see-where-
itegotrme typeof thing). But those are
all so petty, really, And Judge Gage
was going for the big guns. What a
brilliant boost to the American
economy she innovated: the judge
restored Zelikov‘s license on the con-
dition thathe would only driveAmeri»
can cars from now on. That goes for
test times too.

Why hasn’t anyone else ever
thought of this? The Times quoted
Judge Gage calling her action one
prompted “by a sense of patriotism
and a concern for the economy.” What
was Georgethinking when hewentto

mighthave avoided the whole vomit-
ing embarressment. In fact. we
wouldn't have had to worry about the
Japanesebuyingourparts.Itwould’ve
been a good thing, too, ‘cause now
we’re up a creek without a paddle. If
Zelikov can’t test ‘em, the Japanese
surely aren‘t going to want to buy

them.

Here’s the problem: the American
car industry needs the Japanese to
buyourpartsGeorgemayhavepuked
in Japan, but he also signed an agree-
ment saying that the Japanese would
increase their purchases of American
auto pans. One problem is quality,
ThelapanesearenotftndingDetroit's
offerings up to their standards; An-
other quirk in Judge Gage‘s patrior
tism is the minor detail that Japanese
auto makers pump $9 billion a year
into US, based production plants.
According to the US. News and
World Report, the plants are respona

Big deal. The Japanese won't let

of somecrazy agricultural barrier and

trade thing all together. Hell, I say we
stopwith the stupid commercials. You
know the ones: our flag next to
[ITALIC] theirs; thevoice-over warm
ing of what will happen if we Ameri-
cans don’t fight back. Don’t get me
wrong. I don’t have a problem with
political incorrectness in advertis»
ing— let‘s face it. they‘re just totally
ineffective. The guys running Japa-
nese car bashes have a better idea.
And did you read about the gas sta-
tion that offers a discount rate on gas
rorAmencan cars: Aungnt: oomose
multiculturalism freaks don’t like it.
Our economy is falling apart, people.
We don‘t have time to worry about
that crap.

Come on Georgie. Don’t tell us to
buy American,make us. FollowJ udge
Gage’s commendable lead. Why
should out car makers have to im-
prove their products? If we were true—
blue red-blooded Americans (with a
law in the books), we’d have to buy
Chevrolet. I think that we should get
