Youth Minister speaks on Malcolm X

By India Weston

In a full Black Cultural Center at
Drake University last Wednesday
evening,Nation ofIslarn Youth Min-
ister Tarell X, a junior here at Grin—
nell. delivered an informative talk
entitled “Proﬁles of Malcolm X."

Stating that he was “from an ex-
tremely strict Catholic background,”
Mr, X offered that the Nation of

Islam does “not discriminate against 3

any religion," but is “about promot-
ing black people.” His role as Youth

Minister directly entails that promor ,

tion.

Before touching upon the lZpoints ,

of lslam,of which Malcolm X prima

rily spoke, Mr. X inquired as to why
Malcolm has suddenly been embraced
by many persons and, in stating that
many do not really know about
Malcolm X, he proceeded to give a
background history of the slain leader.

Originally bom Malcolm Little,
Malcolm X was born in Omaha. Ne-
braska in 1925. His mixed heritage
was a significant factor in his life, as
well as a reality with which he con-
stantlystruggled. His fatherwaskilled
because he was a follower of Marcus
Garvey,

Before becoming a Muslim,
Malcolm lived “an extremely foul
life,” stated Mr. X, and before
Malcolm was imprisoned, did not
know how to write. It was Malcolm's
brother who introduced him to tire
Nation of Islam.

“Eventually Malcolm went
astray," said Mr. X, selecting lan-
guage thatrelated to the audience that
Malcolmwassn'lllovedandrespected
within the Nation. Mr. X then added
thatthe“govemmentpushelelalcolm
away from his organization," and that

not know his genuine last name.

The context of the points touched
on It variety of areas, all of which
were geared toward the unity of
blacks. Included was acall for blacks
to pull their “resources, education,
and qualiﬁcations” together for indc»
pcndence, and not to force them-
selves into American society. Blacks
must “leam to love self and kind
before loving others,” stated Mr. X,
because “if you are not together, you
can’t reach out to anyone else."

Mr. X further stated that Blacks
must build their own homes, factor
ries, and schools because they are
trained by people who “can’t com
pletely identify" with blacks. On
business terms, Mr. X offered that
blacks also build upon the industry of
sanitary products, because blacks are
different and have certain needs.

The “black family unit has com-
pletely fallen apart; wcshould tryand
stick to our own,” said Mr. X, when
addressing the issue of mixed heri-
tage. He reprimanded blacks’ unr

’ willingness to struggle, and used an

Tarell X

the leader was murdered by ldliers
posing as Muslims. His death was
also a result of a decision to not
search those who came to hear
Malcolm speak, a process which had
always been done.

Mr. X, in embarking upon the 12
points, began by calling for blacks to
“separate,..from the slavemaster," the
slavemaster being the “white man or
white mass." He then stressed the

imponance of understanding Christi-
anity,stating thereligiorr“ﬁts” whites.
not blacks, and has been “tainted“ as
well,

“Recognizing the heritage of your
last name” was another vital point in
Mr. X’stalk. In addressing hisfomter
last name, Rodgers, Mr, X said that
the name, for him, represented the
“complete emaseulation" of black
heritage. He then added that he does

example of blacks letting Koreans
come inand take over their neighbor-
hoods. “Spend your money amongst
yourselves,“ he added.

“You teach a woman. you teach a
nation." was the adage used by Mr. X
in addressing the protection of women,
“The black woman has carried us for
so long.“ Mr. X said that both black
men and women are needed in order
for the Nation to survive.

These points are what Malcolm
usually spoke about, yet the only pic-
tures that people see are of him with
a rifle, said Mr. X. He then stressed
that Malcolm was very disciplined,
eating one meal a day, and becoming
celibate after his fourth child.

Thorson-Smith addresses pornography

By Alison Wade

Issues of sex, violence, freedom,
money, and power were explored in a
presentation by religious studies and
sociology professor Sylvia Thorsonv
Smith last Tuesday at the Jeanne
Burkle Women’s Center.

In her informal presentation. “The
Feminist Debate on Pornography,"
Thorson-Smith discussed divergent
schools of feminist thought on por-
nographyt Sheclaimed that there are
three main areas of conflictregarding
pornography: deﬁnition, harm, and
regulation.

To emphasize the difﬁculty of es-
tablishing a standard deﬁnition of
pornography, Thorson-Smith played
a tape of popular song lyrics which
includedsexualimagcry. Songstang-
ing from Van Morrison‘s
“Moondance” to Van Halen‘s
“Black and Blue" were played, and
discussion followed regarding what
made one song “diny” and another
song acceptable. In addition. people
examined images from popular ade
vertisements for products such as
Calvin Klein’s Obsession and

Nivea skin cream. Group members
obviously didnot share the samedeft-
nition of ":appropriateness," arid it
became clear as the discussion pro-
gressed that there is not a standard
line which divides pornographic im-
agery from sexual imagery,

Thorson-Smith claimed that the
issue of harm is also highly conﬂicted
withregard topomogmphy, Although
links can be made between pomogra-
phy and violence or pornography and
degradation. the causal factors are
neitherclear nor direct. According to
ThorsonASmith, however, women's
testimonies regarding the role of pore
nography in bringing about harmful
changes in their lives are being in4
creasingly used as a means by which
to determine whether or not pomeg-
raphy does in fact increase violence
or degradation.

The difficulties in establishing a
deﬁntion of pornography or in
highlightingtherelationship between
pomegraphy and harm lead to intense
debate over whetherand how to regu»
late it. Feminists such as Andrea
Dworkin equate image with behavior
and hence advocateregulation of pore

nography. Others, however, claim
that images and behavior are distinct,
and that deﬁning pomogmphy is a
dangerously subjective task. Accord
ing to Thorson-Smith. it is this issue
of rcgulationwhich is posin gthe great-
est threat to feminist solidarity.

Some women are dealing with this
conflict by “reclaiming” pomegra—
phy. Companies suchasFemmefilms
are now creating pomogmphy which
presents non-derogatory images of
women and sexuality. Thorson-Smitlt
showed a documentary on the devel-
opment of such companies and the
effect this development was having
on the generally male»dominiatod in-
dustry.

Throughout the presentation,
Thorson—Smith talked at length about
the research she completed asamcme
berof the Task Force on Pornography
for the Presbyterian Church. During
her research, she was exposed to a
number of circumstances which led
her to believe that pornography is a
complex social issue with profound
implications. She spoke of a visitshe
and other members of the Task Force
made to the Times Square area in

New York City. and claims that she
was most deeply struck by “the lone-
liness ofit...by how pathetic it really
was, by the alienation [of the pornor
graphic industry].,.it occured to me
that it wasn’t really immoral, it was
just amoralt"
