With the November
elections just around the cor-
ner, Grinnell‘s Campus Demo-
crats are already busy keeping
the campus informed of their

platform and registering vot-
ers.

“It’s a strange year,”
Campus Democrat President
Evan Zoeckler said. “[After
the election] things will
change.” One way forthe Came
pus Democrats to bring about
changeistopromotetheirviews
by providing the school with
speakers. These will include
both partisan a nd non—partisan
conversationswiththecampus.
Visits from local political can-
didates and various political
writers are planned.

Two speakers already
scheduled to speak to Grinnell
students are Democratic Ur S.
House of Representatives can-
didate Elaine Baxter and Jean
LloydAJones, the Democratic U.
S. Senate candidate from Iowa.
According to Campus Demo-
crat Todd Foreman, “Jean
Lloyd-Jones will be appearing
in the South Lounge of the Fo-
rum from 7:00 p.m.-8:30 pm.
on Tuesday, October 6. She
will give a speech, which will
be followed by a question and
answer period.” The date, time,
andlocationfortheBaxtervisit
is not yet ﬁrm.

In order to better in—
form Grinnell students and fac-
ulty of their political views, the
Campus Democrats are con—
sidering becoming a charter of
the Young Democrats, a na-
tionwide organization of
Democratic students. By doe
ing this, the Campus Demoe
crats hope to get better avail-
ability of information and
speakers.

Another aspect of the
Campus Democrats activities
isto getstudents to vote, To get
people to register, booths will
be set up outside of the Quad
and Cowles. Campus Demo-
crats also intend to go door to

door to insure that voters from
outside the district apply for
and receive their absentee bal-
lots. As a final measure to help
increase Grinnell’s student
body voter turnout, the organi-
zation plans to provide a shuttle
to the ballot boxes.

Why should Grinell
students vote Democrat in the
upcommingelection? Zoeckler
putsitthisway:”The1asttwelve
years under Reagan and Bush
have taken the country no
where“ Bill Clinton offers

progress and new direction.”

GOP

speaker

Although they are not
yet releasing a name, the Grin-
nell College Republicans say
that a big name Republican
speaker will be coming this fall
to the campus.

“This is a person every-
body knows," said Doug Fos-
ter, Vice—President of the Grin-
nell Republicans “This is a big
national ﬁgure. We don’t have
a final commitment yet, but
we’re working on it."

This Fall, the Republi-
cans plan to blanket the came
pus with election information
and speakers, according to
Trevis Parson, the
organization’s President

“Students will defie
nitely see us," he said. “We’ll
have a ton of information avail—

campus.”

Already, the Republi—
cans have made themselves
noticeable.

“We’ve been running
voter registration tables in
Cowles and we ran one at reg-
islration,” said Parson. “We
probably signed up 50 to 60
people to vote.“

A party is one of the
first big Republican events
planned for September.

“We’re throwing a
party at Harris within the next
two weeks,” said Foster.
“We‘re also going to bring
speakers to campus. Will
Lynch, Senator Grassey of
Iowa, and Ken Hamblin, a na»
tionally-syndicated columnist
out of Denver, are just some of
the speakers that will be on
campus."

Lincoln said that the
college spends over eight mil-
lion dollars, a sizable chunk of
the annual budget, on enroll-
ment. With thatkind of money
being spent, it is important to
ensure that the dollars are well
spent, that the students are
served as efﬁciently as pos‘
sible, and that Grinnell is made
to appear a viable and attrac-
tive option to qualified students
who mightbe considering other
schools, said Lincolnt

On sharpening the
school’scompetitiveedge,Lin-
coln said that one strategy be-
ing considered is an increased
use of alumni in making Grin—
nell an appear an attractive
choice. A search is currently
underway for new permanent
Directors of Admission and
Financial Aid. The positions’
availability has been announced
at Grinnell‘s sister schools in
the American Colleges of the
Midwest (ACM), and in sev-
eral other forums. Lincoln said
that the applications received
from this search process will
be reviewed along with appli-
cations from the current acting
directors if indeed they apply.

While the new shape
that the enrollment administra-
tion is taking sounds positive,

questions still linger about
former Director of Admissions
JohnHopkins‘ resignation. The
college‘sresignation announce-
ment contained no specific rea
sons for Hopkins’ departure.
While this newspaper is not a
forum for rumor or unfounded
conjecture,itisafactthatspecu-
lation exists that Hopkins was
asked to resign. This specula-
tion,combinedwithFerg-uson’s
comments on the new agenda
for recruiting and enrollment
and the timing ofHopkins’ rese
ignation, begs the question of
whether Hopkins’ departure
was precipitated by either his
reluctance or failure to ad
equately pursue the new strate—
gies

No one could comment
on the record about this specu-
lation, and Hopkins was un-
available for an interview.
Ferguson said, however, that
one should not infer from this
restructuring that the Admis
sions Office and Hopkins were
not doing their jobs Lincoln
agreed, emphasizing that the
college did not have a “broken
system.” As for Hopkins,
Ferguson said simply, “He re-
signed."
