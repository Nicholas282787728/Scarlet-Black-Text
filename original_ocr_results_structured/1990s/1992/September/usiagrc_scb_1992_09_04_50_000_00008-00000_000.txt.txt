EDITORIAL

It has been made abuna
dantly clear in public letters
that John Brentnall was re-
quired to prematurely end his
term as SGA vice president
because he is on academic prof
baxion for plagiarism It has
been made equally clear that
his plagiarism was ruled to be
inadvertent. To us, that means
that he is in fact and principle,
if not in law, not guilty. He
madeamismke,perhapsoutof
carelessness. But he is not a
willful plagiarist.

Of course, we under—
stand the rules. Plagiarism is
plagiarism, and

that sort of academic dis-
honesty requires the penalty of
academic probation Students

on academic probation may not
serve in public office. But if
Brentnall’s plagiarism was, in
fact, inadvertent, is it essenr
tially just that the man elected
by us to serve as our vice presi—
dent be barred from his office
because of a perhaps honest
mistake? Furthermore, if his
plagiarism was, in fact, inadr
vertent, then why has he taken
such a selfeﬂagellating tone in
his letters posted around came
pus and published in the Scar-
let & Black? Ifhe is truly not
guilty ofdeliberate plagiarism,
then why does he invite unjust
blows by personally publicize
ing his case?

If Brentnall is truly not
a plagiarist, then he should be
allowed to hold his office.

+ OPINION*

To the Grinnell
student body,

It is with great disap~
pointment that I must inform
you that I will not serve as
Student Government
Association’s Vice
President.President of Aca—
demic Affairs for the upcom-
ing school year. Through ignor
rance and misfortune, I became
ineligible for the office.

Late last semester, I
submitted a paper that was par-
tially plagiarized Although I
cited the material used from
other sources, I did notputquo-
tation marks around all of the
quoted phrases and sentences.
This oversightputmein aposi-
tion of having to testify before
the Committee on Academic
Honesty. They found me guilty
of plagiarism, but ruled that I
had done it unintentially; there»
fore, the penalty administered
was relatively slight compared
to what might have happened.
However, the standard two sev
mesters of academic dishon-
estyprobation still applies. This
probation prevents me from
serving as VP/PAA.

I found out about this
situation almost two months
ago, so I have had plenty of
time to experience the cycle of
emotions anyone would feel.
The worst feeling that I have,
though is that I let the students
ofGrinnell College down. You
gave me your trust and I didn’t
follow through by any stretch
of the imagination

Soon, an election will
be held to determine the new
VP/PAA. I plan to assist the
new VP during the transition
time to insure a relatively
smooth start to the year. Once
again, I am sorry for breaking
the trust between you, the stu»
dents of Grinnell, and me (me,
myself. or 171 never know).

Sincerely,

John Brentnall

ON CAMBODIA

Since the French
decolonization of southeast
Asia in the 19503, civil war has
often plagued Cambodia, and it
may do so again, According to
National Review, the Khmer
Rouge have refused to cooper,
ate with UN. peacekeeping
forces by disarming and ceas-
ing to plant land mines. Bad
news for ordinary Cambodi~
ans, oneineighryeﬁveofwhom
has lost a limb in a mine blast.

It was foolish to expect
that the Khmer Rouge, who
killed 2,000,000 people in
1975-78 (before being driven
back into the jungle by Vietr
nameseinvaders),wouldcheer-
fully agree to behave sociably.
But putting aside the bloody
Khmer Rouge record, the
U.N.’smoralauthorityisatsuch
a level that its efforts to arbi-
trate lapse quickly into farce.

The UN. came into
being in 1945 amid much cant
about peace, brotherhood, and
cooperation. Now, it was hap-
pily expected, problems could
be solved without another de—
scent into the madness and bar
barityof war. Apparently, how—
ever, the U.N. was only willing
to criticize nations of the
“north” (it devoutly believed in
the concept of a “north~south”
division popularized by liberal
intellectuals.) All). Taylor
writes in his History of the
World that the UN. hissed and
spat at mildly ﬂawed western
nations, such as Israel, Chile,
and South Africa, but ignored
the moral enortnities of third
world countries, like Uganda.

While quick condemn
apartheid in South Africa, mili-
tary nile in Chile, and the tier
nial ofrights to Arabs in Israel,
the UN. was willing to over—
look the cartoon-level violence
in Uganda, whereIdi Arrtinwas
cutting off penises, eating po-

litical rivals, and shooting in-
tellectuals. (When asked later
by ajoumalist how the country
was going to be run with all the
intellectuals shot, Aminreplied
“If they were so smart how
come they’re all dead?”—dis-
playing that morbid wit with
which petty tyrants seem to be
blessed.)

Furthermore, the
U.N.——which attacked the
O.A.S. and Afrikaaner terror-
istsiwent out of its way to
accomodate the P.L.O., giving
it a seat on its general council.
In his great work Modern
Times, the British historian Paul
Johnson argues that the effect
of this was to legitimize left-
wing terrorism. But if this was
in‘esponsible, and if theU.N.’s
spasms of abuse were
hypocritical and silly, they
were as nothing compared to
the U.N.‘s bloody blunders in
the Congo.

Unable to defeat anti-
colonialist black rebels, Bel—
gium withdrew in 1960 from
the Congo, as ecstatic liberals
chanted the familiar mantras of
“democracy" and “self»deter-
mination.” Neither ensued,
however. After assuming dic»
tatorial powers on a scale Tito
would envied, Patrice
Lumumba (from whom the
Sovietuniversitytookitsname)
ordered the Congo’s army to
crush the Katangan indepen-
dence forces led by Moise
Tshombe. But the Katangans
provedbraveandcunningftght-
ers, anditquickly became clear
that Lumumba’s troops were
not up to the task assigned them,
whereuponhe soughthelpfrom
the UN. In midviuly, the blue-
helmeted troops began to are
rive en masse in Leopoldville.
Not long afterwards the
Katangans were crushed and
Tshombe captured and shot.

In addition to showing
that the UN, has not always
