Change and Instice: two new organizations on campus

by Kendra Ford

Atthe end of lastyear there
was much controversy concerning
the college policy on rape and sexual
Harassment cases. Students made
accusations that the college policy
did not protect women adequately
and that the college was secretive
about statistics on crime rates. This
dissatisfaction resulted in someclosed
women’s meetings at the Stonewall
Center and an open forum meeting in
North Lounge where students were
able to openly express their grieve
ances and make suggestion to such
people as Tom Crady of Student Af-
fairs. These meetings have resulted
in many changes in college policy.

The mostdircctresultofihe
Open Forum meeting was the cre
ation of the Presidential Task Force
on harassment. Dave Rapp spoke to
the Scarlet andBlack about what the
Task Force has been doing and what
it plans to achieve. The basic objec-
tive of the Task Force for the year is
to revrse the judicial grievance pro
cedure. The msk force consists of
members ofthe faculty, the staff, and
twelvestudentpositions. Frank Tho-
mas, Special Assistant to the Presi-
dent, is Chair of this Task Force,
which met once before the summer
and had its first meeting of this year
last Wednesday evening in Grinncll
House. Over the summer three stu—
dents worked with faculty to begin
organization. The summer meetings

includedolentvofresearchintoother
college‘s policies to find out how

other universities cope with the very
real problem of rape and harassment.
SeniorsDavcRappandScottMuskin,
along with graduate Kris Koch,
helped to create the subcommittee
which has overseen several changw
in campus ofﬁcial policy and proce-
dure. The changes include a re-con~
ttacting of the Mental Health Center,

the creation of a poster to be distrib-
uted on campus, and a plan for cam-
pus education on the subject of rape
and harassment.

Tom Crady has worked out
anewconu-actwith iheMcniall-leahh
Center in town to increase the scrr
vices they provide to College stu4
dents. The changes include more
available hours f orappointmcnts and
the mandate that a student receive an
appointment within three days ofrcr
questing one. The new contract also
calls for the Mental Health Center to
run a support group each semester,
which would be a closed therapy
group for students. This semester‘s
group may be for survivors ofsexual
assault and abuse but the subject of
the group is ﬂexible according to
student needs. Three therapist at the
Health Center will complete training
for victim counseling.

The poster was created
largely by the students. It is modeled
on the birth control/STD charts al-
ready posted in bathrooms and will
be released early next week. The
gray pamphlet of statistics which all
students received at the beginning of
the year was also requested by the
students. Rapp notcd thatan interest
ing coincidence had occurred cone
ccming the publication of the pam-
phlei.

According to Rapp, at the
same time students were requesting
that campus crime statistics be made
public and that the college have em.
pic-yew trained to counsel survivors
ofmpc the goveniinentwas simultar
ncousiylcgislzitingthatsuch changes
take place. Apparently, federal law,
recently rcquircd that colleges make
public all-smiistics on cam pus crime.
It was also legislated that colleges
andpolicedepartmentsmustguaranr

certain bill of rights. Both bills of
rights will be on the posters.

Alice Ostrlick also spoke
with the Scar/cl and Black about the
new organizations which have come
outof the Task Force. According to
Ostdiek there are two new groups
taking action on campus: Change
and Justice. Change has education
as it focus for, “...the best way to
combat the problem (of sexual as-
saultand rape) is to educate people.”
said Ostdick. She defined Justice as
a group concerned with intervention,
by way of changes in the judicial
processes on campus.

Justice invoked some
changes over the summer, including
minor changes in the Student Hand»
book but not much ofﬁcial change
occurred. The maindiffcrences made
in Ihcpolicy concern tthrt‘sidcntial
Hearing Board. The Hearing Board

The first change is one of personnel.

change has been made so that Grin-
ncll will be in compliance with the
latest changes in Iowa State Law.

the focus of the Task Force this so-
nicstcr will be on the Presidential
Hearing Board Justice also set in
motion a program which Will work
outside of the formal system ofcom-
plaint and intervention.

This new project is set up
solely to assist the survivors of rape
or sexual harassment through the
tiaumaof their experience. Formerly
Student Affairs did not report crimes
to the police. New regulations re-
quire lhat any crime reported to Stu-
dent Affairs or to R.A.’s (who are
technically Student Affairs employ-
ees) must be rcportcd to thc police.
When speaking to the Scarlet and
Black Tom Crady said he was glad of
the new firm policy on crime report
ing; he feels that Student Affairs
would not ever have to worry about
having information and not being
ablc to actonitand hesaid, “It would
be irresponsible to be in a position
like that." lnlightolthe Ihcscchanges
the Task Force and members ofJus»
lice felt that another form of assis-
tance was needed which was confi~
dcnlial in nature. For this purpose
they formed a group of advocates,
people specially trained to counsel

victims. This summer a number of
students were trained as “vtcti m coun»
selors"as defined by Iowa Law. The
legal requirements for this position
include twenty hours of training and
supervision by a recognized agency.

The advocacy program is
completelyconfidentialithe names
of students who are advocates will
not be released. Also anything dis-
cussed with an advocate is held in
strictconl'idenc. A studcntcan gctin
touch with an advocate by calling a
central number, 259-4848, ttnd gel-
ting a referral. The phone number
will be prinlcdcd on the previously
discussed posters which may be gen-
erally available next week. The call
will be received by the Health Center
and someone there will connect the
caller with an advocate on duty.
However the advocacy program is
not technically run by the Health
Center; it is supervised by the
Marshalltown Domestic Violence
Alternative. Although the advocacy
program is still working out its logis-
ticsitwillbesoonbefullyttmctional.
The phone number will be connected
in the firs part of the week. But for
change to be truly effective Studans
must be aware of the available op-
tions, which returns one to other
group, Change.

Change is making students

cusstons, and other active means of
