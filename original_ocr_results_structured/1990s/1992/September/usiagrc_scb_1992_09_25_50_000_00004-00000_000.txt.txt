JUSTICE calls for the truth about crime

by Elizabeth Leonard

There isalong-terrn effectofnot
telling the whole truth. In the lastfew
weeks since the semester has stand,
the members of JUSTICE, a student
organization involved with the im-
provement of administration policy
concerning sexual crimes, have heard
a lot of surprise expressed in relation
to the pamphlet Crime Awareness
and Campus Security a! Grinnell
College. To comply with a new fed
eral law about students‘ nghm-to-
know, this pamphlet is distributed to
every strident, prospective students,
and parents. “If there wereonly three
rapes last year,” said one first-year.
“then why did We have all of that
sexual harassment stuff emphasized
so much? What’s the big deal?”

I and other members of JUS-
TICE were shocked at the absence of
problems or issues that the “suns
tics"seemedtoindicate.Butwesoon
began to realize what was going on.
After a closer look, we saw that not
everything was as it seemed. These
statistics, in our opinion, are bunk.
Honest bunk— we accuse no one of
lying. However, statisticscan be mis-
leading, and this pamphlet is a per-
fect example.

Forexample,weknow of atleast
6 bicycles that were stolen from the
campus last year. However, if you
will note on the chart, there is no
indication of 6 bicycles (or any) be»
ing stolen. How, then, do these facts
coexist? Simple. If you look under
the definitions of these crimes in the
pamphlet (if you do not have one,
Student Affairs will be happy to sup
plyit),bicycletheftdoes notfitunder
the definition ofburglary. The loggia
from which the bikes were stolen, is
not an enclosed, securable space.
therefore not a “structure”. So Stu-
dent Affairs does not have to report
the crimes to the public.

Next,please note the incidences
of reported rapes. Only three. How
ever, if you would consult your Stu»
dentHandbookyouwillsee thatthere
is no violation called “tape” at Grin-
nell College, only sexual abuse, and
sexual assault. Most sexual vioiav
tions are listed as sexual abuse, and
are therefore unnecessary to report
(although Tom Crady assuresmethai
if there is ”forced penetration", he
will list the charge as rape. He did not
make clear whether it would become
a rape statistic, however. For more

that the college uses different definir

Shaved
heads hit
campus

by Howard Horn

Thereis agrowing Ll’Cl'ldﬂLGl'inr
nell College. All over campus both
men and women have decided to
solve the problem that plagues us
everymoming (i.e. Whatdo I do with
my hair?) by simply getting rid of it.
A little bitof work with the clippers,
and, presto! the era of the shaved
head has started at Grinnell.

People with shaved heads are
nothing new to society. Movies,
sports,’l‘. V., and music have popu-
larized the look for years. Sinead
O’conorhas even made the look popur
lar for women. Yet, despite their
visible role models, shaved heads
have never really penetrated main-
stream American culture. Thosewith
shavedheadsusedtobemorestrongly

affiliated with a political movement
titan a fashion movement. Grinnell
students are helping to change this
notion.

One of these warriors for change
is James Crane. On the spur of the
moment, Crane decided to shave it
off. Now. he loves it. “I think I’m
very cute,” Crane said of his new
hairdo. “It’s very fuuy, and I like to
have people rub my head.” Crane
also described his look as making
him “feel macho.”

Another person walking around
campus Without hair is Todd
Alexander. Alexanderclaimstohavc
shaved his head many times. He did
it most recently because it was the
”thing to do at the time." Although
he likes his shaved head, hedcscribcs
it as being not nearly as attractive as
hair. Both Craneand Alcxandcrstrcss
that their Clean head has no Special
meaning, such as political affilia—
tion.

So you’ve been reading this at-
ticlcandnowrealizcthattthrinncll
hairless are neither freaks nor far
political rightist. Is this something

you would like to do'.7 The person to
seeis MutttHuang. l-luang,although
nota shaved head himself, is a strong
believer in the new look. “I like
[shaved heads]. I ﬁnd women with
shaved heads very attractive." Huang
is willing to make a deal with Grin-
nell students. He Will shave any
one’s head for free.

Having a bare head has its tide
vantages. Crane claims, “It’s easier
to take care of.” Imagine, no split

Students
start knitting
craze

by Mara Fishman

TheaspirmgknittcrsofAmcrica
have invaded Gt-innell. With the help
of Julie Lund, owner of Sit n’ Knit,
GrinriellCollegestudenlshavc found
a way to release stress, have fun and

becreative. Groups of approximately
twenty students have been spotted
knitting glorious hats and swwters in
an attempt to not only shirk their
academic responsibilities but to pre~
pare themselves for the upcoming
Subzero weather.

Everyone is welcome at the For
rum coffeehouse on Sundays at 7:30
pm. to comeiearn how to knit, share
knowledge, or just hang out. Lund
satdlhatkmltingcan beagreatbreak
from studying and a good creative
outlet. She emphasized thcinformul
nature of the group and she encourr
ages people to cornejust to see what
the knitters are doing if not to actu-
ally knit.

Because the club doesn't have a
budgcl.kmllcrsmuslbrlnglhcirown
supplies. These can be oblmned at
Lund’s store on 4th Avenue or at
Wal-Mart. lfanyone is having prob-
letns, Lund and other experienced
knitlcrs are there to help. The knit-
ting group is now in the process of
becoming an ofﬁcial club on cam-
pus.

quired to use those definitions by
federal law, but they did not have to
stop there. We think that it is irre-
sponsible ofStudent Affairs, and the
coilege,toietstudentsthinkihatdiese
few figures represent the whole, ac-
curate truth.

So finally we come to the real
issue here. Why has the college cov-
ered up all ofthe restofthe statistics?
For example, where are the siatisucs
on sexual or racial harassment at the
college? We think that we have a
"right-to-know" what they are.
Frankly, it seems that the college
wishes to keep up its ‘idyllic‘ image
for the “benefit" of prospective and
new students. But who is really ben—
eﬁting? When students find out the
truth, that they have been “duped,"
they are likely to be bitter and angry.
Also,acheap movelikethatmightbe
expected at other schools, but Grinr
nell College is rated one ofthe top 20
scitools in the nation in its class.
More is expected of us here, and we
expect more from the college, too.
Students are told that they are adults,
and will be treated as such. Well
then, Student Affairs should suit ac
tion to words. The student organiza-
tion JUSTICE believes that anyone
who comes to Grinneil College de-
serves the right and common cour-
lesy to make a real, informed deci-
sion about the community they are
living in, Students, not just the ad-
ministration, deserve to know the
whole truth about their home.

The members of JUSTICE en-
courages everyone to always report
incidents of crime, even if those sta-
tistics are not made public at the
present. Also,StudentAffairsshould
be urged by students to do more titan
simply meet the bare minimum in
orderiopasstheseguidelinesofhon-
esiy. Students won't know the truth
until we work to get it, and we all
neerl to reali7c that every number
counts. Help Student Affairs and
