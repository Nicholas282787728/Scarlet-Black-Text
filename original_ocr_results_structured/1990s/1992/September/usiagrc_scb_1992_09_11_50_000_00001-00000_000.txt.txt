Bob's back

H Coffeehouse under new direction

by Ch topher Fletcher

With questions over accountabil-
ity with SGA money, individual
power and proper business structure
being dealt with carefully, Bob’s
Underground, the student-run coffee
housewhich oponeditsdoorsinApril,
reopened Saturday.

Plaguedby accounting,billingand
sales tracking problems, the coffee
house ended last semester in what
SGA treasurer Melissa Watson de»
scribed as a “dangerous" situation.
Last year, said Watson, she had a lot
of questions for her cabinetcolleagues
and the Underground‘s management
about the status of the operation.
While she was told that things were
generally fine, she was still very cone
ccmed about how the coffee house
was meeting the state regulations
governing that type of business and
with the accounting of the money
provided for its startup and opera-
tion by SGA. That latter concern
became the most serious.

“We had no idea where money
was going,” Watson said. “There
wasnostructure inplaceatall.” While
evcryoneagrecd thatthecoffcehousc
was a great idea. Watson said that
everyone moved ahead on making
the idenareality withoutany definite
plan of action.

According to Watson, Joint Board
twice approved for monies for Bob’s
Underground, but no one could later
explain exactly how the money was
spent,norwerereccipLsreadilyavaiL
able. Watson explained that by the
end of this experiment in structure-
less business, she had a large stack of
paperthcexactmeaningofwhich she
could notdisccm. She could not tell
whether certain bills had cver been
paid, and shcpcrsonally had tophonc
vendors to determine the
Underground’s account status.

The three were able to combine their
materials and begin to sort out some
sort of picture of Bob‘s
Underground's situation and devise
a strategy and structure for its future
operation.

Returning coffee house manager
Alexia Brue is directly answerable
now to an executive committee com-
prisedofWauon,SGA assistantcrear
surer Jason Franc], SGA president
Angela Onwuachi, social coordina»
tor Sarah Jepsen, and administrative
coordinator Clay Patty.

Last year, said Watson, the plan
was to keep the coffee house com-
pletely outsidethe fold ofSGA. This
year, she said, “We are completely
going againstthatpolicy.” But shcis
notapologeticformisandshestands
solidlyonthercasonsforlhechanges
and contrasts those changes with the
errors of last semester. Since SGA
finances Bob’s Undergrounrl, and
since SGA is ultimately responsible
for the money it gives to the coffee
house, Watson maintains that “it
makes no sense for it to be such a
separate entity [from SGA]."

Watson emphasizes carefully,
however, that there has been no SGA
“takeover” of the Underground. The
new structures for its management
benefit the coffee house because they
will keep it on a firm business footy
ing, and they beneﬁt SGA because
they make what Watson described as
the “checks and balances" work.
Watson was troubled by what she
saw as a concentration of power in
too few hands and a lack of account-
ability on the part of the SGA Cabi-
net for its actions. Watson said that
