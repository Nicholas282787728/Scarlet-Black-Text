Hearing Board reforms

by Kendra Ford

Frank Thomas, special assismnt
to thcprcsidentand chairofthePrest-
dential Hearing Board, spoke with
die Scarlet and Black on Wednesday
concerning college policy and regu-
lation changes. One ofthe firstthtngs
Thomas had to say was to make a
distinction between policy and reguA
lations. Thomas assened that, “Grin-
nell looks on itself as a community
and that we all have to work together.
we have to respect each other.“Based
on this premise the College didn't
have a policy on rape, per se. But
Thomas wenton to explain that regur
lationsaretointerpretcollegepolicy.
So that when,as he said, people in the
community don’t respect each other
there isaway to protect the rest of the
community. If someone has been
found to violate college policy, as
sexual abuses cases obviously do,
the enforcers of policy can take some
action, ranging from conduct proba-
tion to dismissal. Thomas empha-
sized the fact that the Presidential
Hearing Board, as the college’s en»
forcing agency, is not a criminal jus-
tice agency; the only power they have
is to place a violator on probation,
suspension,ordismissal.Thomasex-
pressed concertt that last year stu-
dents perceivcd that there were con-
victedrapistsrunningaroundon cam-
pus. To dispel the concerns he ex-
plained the policies of the Presidcnr
tial Hearing Board and the major
changes which have occured over the
summer and this year.

As mentioned in last week's ar—
ticle it used to be that the complainv
ant did not receive a copy of the
written decision of any hearing, but
now both parties receive a copy of
the decision. Thomas explained, as
was mentioned last week, that the
availability ofinformatton tsduetoa
change in the Federal Privacy Act
Funhcr,Thomas Supplied the Scarlet
and Black with the basic statistics on
what cases had come before the Hear-

ing Board in the past 12 years. He
noted that it is important to realize
that notall reported incidents receive
a hearingwith theBoard, each case is
reviewed to establish whether it can
be fully substantiated. In the lastacar
demic year three hearings were con-
ducted on rape and harassment, one
resulted in conduct probation, one in
mandatedcounseling,andoneincom-
plainant/respondent separation, The
year before last two cases of sexual
hamssment were heard, one resulted
in suspension and counseling and the
other resulted in conduction proba-
tionand relocation on campus. These
statistics, from the archives of the
President, are available for general
examination in a reserve file in the
library. Minutes from all Task Force
meetings are also available, on re-
serve in the library.

Thomas went on to elaborate
further changes in the Hearing Board
process. It used to be that if charges
were brought the complainant and
respondent had to contact their own
witnesses. Now, the parties inform
HelenScott’sofficeoflheirwitnesses
and her office contacts the witnesses
and arranges for their statements to
be taken. Much of the coordinating
of witnesses will be done by a new
Coordinator for Sexual Assault and
Abuse cases. This woman works on
contractwith the college and will be
called upon when needed. She will
be in charge of taking witness state—
ments, interviewing all parties, and
writing up summaries. She will write
up statements forthewitnesses, which
they will sign (as approval). In the
past the Hearing Board did all of the
investigation while attempting to
complete the hearing as well. The
Coordinator will provide the infor—
mation for with which the Hearing
Board makes decisions. The Hearing
Board decides ifthcre will be a hear-
ing and if there is the Board then
decides who, of the witnesses, will
appear. Often each party has many

character witnesses, from whom writ-
ten statelnents are sufﬁcient. Every-
one involved in thee case will see
copies of the statements.

The process of complaint has
changed as well, also partially in re-
sponse to student complaintand sug-
gestion. Whenever a student wishes
to file a complaint they, themselves,
will fill outa form in quadruplicate.
Having the student ﬁll out the form
eliminates any confusion on what
was said, relieves the college of any
liability. Filing a complaint does not
automatically guarantee a hearing.
One copy of the complaint form is
given to the respondent, one to the
Presidential Hearing Board, one to
the Grinnell Police Department, and
one to the complainant Xerox cope
ies of the form are given to the
President’s ofﬁce to be ﬁled under
the Crime Statistics Reporting Act
and another copy is given to Student
Affairs. As was explained in last
week’s article any assault or harass-
mentwhtch isreported to thcAdmin-
istrattve or Judicial branches of the
college will be reported to the police.
If the student takes no further action
the police will not take the case any
further. If a student is uncomfonable
with the incident being reporttx‘l to
the police they should contact the
Advocacy program for confidential
advice or counseling. The number
for the program is, 269-4848. Thor
mas supplied the Scarlet and Black
with a copy ofa diagram oftheJudi-
cial process of the Hearing Board in
an attempt to increase student's un-
derstanding of the process. Thomas
also informed the Scarlet and Black
that the meetings of the Presidential
Task Force on Sexual Harassment
are open to the campus community.
The Task Force meets thesecondand
forth Wednesdays of every month at
7:15pm in Cowles and any member
of the campus community is wel-
come. The next Task Force meeting
will be this Wednesday, Sept. 23,

Smeal on ERA

by Aida Ruilova

Eleanor Smeal, President of the
Fund for the Feminist Majority, de-
liveredatalk on the lowaEqualRights
Amendment which is up for ratifica-
tion by voters in November. In front
of a packed Harris Cinema Sept. 14,
Smeal spoke passionately about the
injustices she sees done to women
every day of their lives.

Among these injustices, accord
ing to Smeal: In homes, housewives
do not have access to equal distribu-
tion ofthe property shared with their
husbands. In cases of divorce,women
are customarily given custody of the
children while the noncustodial pare
ent usually pays little or no child
support. Women who work to main-
tain a cenain standard of living for
their families are further discrimi-
nated by eaming 71 cents for every
dollar a man makes, even though the
job is exactly the same. In education,
women receive one—half of what men
receive in athletic opportunities.
Although Iowa tales abithigher than

most states in this respect, statistics
show that athletic opportunities for
men and women are still far from
beingequal. This isnotatall. Women
are given fewer scholarships and
grands than men are because of a
gender-bias in the procedures of aca-
demic evaluation. Outside educa-
tion, women arediscriminated against
by the Insurance industry which
shamelessly overcharges women for
life insurance yet underpays women
in beneﬁts.

In Iowa, Smeal declared that the
Equal Righs Amendment would es-
tablish the principle that discriminaa
tion on the basis of gender is against
the law in all institutions, programs,
and policies in which state, county,
or municipal participation occurs As
of now, the status of women is cur-
rently that of “secondary citizens",
according to Smeal. The Federal
Constitution itself discriminates
against women by excluding them
from the statement: “all men are crc~
aied equal." This applies to the Iowa
constitution as well,
