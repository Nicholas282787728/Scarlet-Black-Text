Resident organizes for Jackson

By Sharyn Obsatz

Nestled amidst the comfields of
Iowa, one might hardly expect the
town of Grinnell to be a hotbed of
national political activism Yet. out
of his quiet split-level home here,
SteveCobblehasinitiatedagmssroots
campaign to draft Jesse Jackson for
the Vice Presidential candidate on the
Democrat ticket

A political consultant who served
as Jesse Jackson‘s 1988 national del-
egate coordinator, Cobble believes
Jackson will balance the Democratic
ticket politically, bringing to Wash
ington representation for “the nor
glected people in our country.”
CobblesaidJackson will give Clinton
the extra margin needed to win what
Cobble predicts will be a three—way
election between George Bush, Ross
Perot and Bill Clinton in November.

Last March, Cobble sent letters
and petitions to between 150 and 200
friends from the Jackson ‘88 com-
paign, encouraging them to organize
within their own states. The move
mcnt plans to make the case forJesse
Jackson’s Vice Presidential qualifi-
cations in order to force the issue onto
the Democratic Party agenda.

“It’s a little strange to see some-

thing like this starting in a place like
Grinnell, Iowa,” admitted Cobble.
However, he said, “in the electronic
age...a great deal of American poli-
tics is conducted by fax machine or
over the phone, and it doesn’t really
matter where you are."

Active in politics for over twenty
years inNew Mexico, Cobble andhis
wife,Molly Smith,moved to Grinnell

because the town was near her par-
ents and is “a good place to raise a
family." As the date of 1992 Demo
cratic Convention approached and
no one had initiated a draft Jesse
Jackson for VicePresidenicarnpaign,
Cobblcsaid he feltcompelled to step
in and ”do the right thing.”

Cobble offered both moral and
political reasons whthtckson should
be on the Democratic ballot for Vice
President.

resentation for constituents who are

usually “taken for granted." Cobble
saidlacksoncouldrejuvenatedemoer
racy and reinvigorate the Democratic
party by bringing into politics the
“people who had given up and left our
democracy."

Jackson as Vice President would
also complement the leadership of
Clinton as President, said Cobble.

“Clinton is based in the South;
Jackson built his career in the Mid-
west Clinton is popular among rural
whites in the South, Jackson among
urban and nirai African-Americans
evorywhere...Clinton is an insider,
the favorite ofthc media and much of
the party Establishment; Jackson is
the ultimatc grassroots outsider, in a
very ‘outsidcr’ year," Cobble said.

Cobble also believes Jackson has
earned the Vice Presidential position.

“Jesse Jackson knows more for
eign leaders personally than probably
anyotherdemocmtsineelimmyCartcr
and Walter Mondale. . .To most of the
people of the world, Jesse Jackson is
the symbol of hope in this country.
