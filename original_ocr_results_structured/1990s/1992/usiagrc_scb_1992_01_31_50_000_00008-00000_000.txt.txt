Weird Science
Two high school guys make the ultimate woman, using a computer, a digitizer, some leftovers from Vogue,
and some bizarre lightning. Predictably, they have a party. Predictably, things go wrong. Funny, non»
pretentious movie (based on a true story! ll). Woman then goes on to apply to Grinnell. Weird Science will
be shown tonight and Sunday night at 9:00 pm. in North Lounge.

Terrace Gallery

By Jenny Vacchiano

Check out Kiki Anderson’s art ex-
hibit, “Beads, Bananas and Bright
Colors,” now on display in the Ter-
race Gallery at the Forum.

Inspired by a trip to Senegal, West
Africa, where she interned with the
US. Embassy last summer,
Anderson‘s drawings (mostly pastel
and ink) are ﬁlled with brightly colA
ored WestAfrican tradingbeads. The
beads, Anderson explained, were
made in Veniceand used to trade with
West Africa for slaves. Now
collector’s items, the beads are sold
by the West Africans.

When asked why she chose to fo-
cuson thebeads,Anderson explained,
“I really wanted to capture the color
that I saw down there the people
wear such bright colors."

In her bead drawings, she sets out
to show contrasts. Her beads are set
against Sandyrcolored backgrounds.
“l was trying to show the contrast
between the bright colors that the
people wearandthcenvironmcntthat
they live in, which is mostly sand."
she explained.

In her paintings, Anderson also
expresses thecontrastofbeingawhite
person in a place whereevcryone else
is black: like the beads in her paint-
ings, she stands out.

Anderson stressed, after explain-
ing some of her drawings, that she
does not like to say too much about
them. She wants people to create
their own explanations when looking
at her art. However, one person had
described her beads as donuts, and
she thought it important to note,
“They’re not donuts!”

Along with her beads is a painting
of bananas. “Bananas,” Anderson
said,“wereabigpariofmylifcdown
there." Thcre is also a large Hershey
Kiss painting which, as you might
guess,wasnotinspircdbyhchencgal

Anderson explained that her draw-
ings helpedtosolidifyhercxpcricncc

Movie Boyz N the Hood explores
African—American urban life

By Brett Fechheimer

Director John Singleton’s ambir
tlous first film, Bayz N the Hood,
explores thcaiinlcssness,despair,and
— despite the odds —- hopeful opti-
mism of contemporary life in an Afr
ricanrAmcrican neighborhood in
south central Los Angelcs.

Released last summer to critical
praise, Boyz paints a mostly bleak
picture of urban black life. In this
“hood,"policehelicoptcrs constantly
fly overhead, and the bullets from the
guns ofwarring gang members make

even hanging out with friends a po-
tentiallylife-threateningwaytospend
a weekend night.
Indeed,iheprevalanceofgangvior
lence and drugs have put an indelible
strainon alloflhc film’scharactersA
including the teenage protagonistTre
Styles (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) and his
best friend Ricky (Morris Chestnut),
bout of whom disapprove of gangs
and the self-destructive chaos they
generate.
Still,muChOfBDyzp'dSSchywithr
out scenes of violence and mayhem
(and thankfully without the two-di-

mensional Aft-i can-American characr
ters so common elsewhere). We see
Tre, his family,and his friends enjoy—
ing themselves at a backyard barbe-
cue. We watch as Tre tells his father
about a memorable sexual experi-
ence, and we smile as Trc and Ricky
lightheartedly tease each other.

Indeed, Trc and Ricky are nothing
more or less than typical American
teenagers, and that fact is one reason
why this film is often terribly sad.

Bay; will show tonight at 7:00
p.m., and Sunday at3:00 pm. in the
Harris Cinema.

Old Grinnell traditon revived
with T itular Head film contest

By Sharyn Obsatz

Titular Head represents all that 15
most nobly cherished in the modern
world of television and film. Froc-
dom, creativity, a passion for great-
ncssiull tltcse are embodied in one
glorious night of studentrpmduccd
films and fermented beverages.

Born ofa pioneering spirit, Tilular
Head boldly culminated that other
great Grinncll tradition, the drunken

orgies of debauchery also known as
tho Spring Relays. Originally a talent
competition featuring some of
Grinncll’s finest, Titular Head mar
turcd into n festival of student-made
movies, the winncr of which was to
be judged by audience applause.
Shortly after the relays were can-
cclod, the tradition of Titular Head
faltcrod. Sadly, with the renovation
of ARI-l and thc reallocation of its
auditorium space,the class of‘93 was

the first to be scarred by the absence
of this bolovcd tradition.

Nevertheless, Tituliir l-lcad has
lived on in the hearts and minds of
Grinncll students. This year, we wclr
come with outstretched arms iLv rc-
tum. Wecinbrttcc its symbolic mean-
ing, its continuation of our CollCCth‘,
past, Titular Head will take place on
April 11. 1992. The fateful day last
approaches. Let the brave among us
take up our cameras.
