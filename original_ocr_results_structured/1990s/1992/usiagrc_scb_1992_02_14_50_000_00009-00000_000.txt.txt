such as “Definition of Ambiguity,”
by Kevin Gordon. Also on display
are reliefs, such as Lucinda

bisque clay and paint. There is one

are a few examples of stylized self-

:Russian sacred choral
:music recorded at Grinnell

By Jennifer Vacchiano

) The Grinnell Community Chorus
and The Grinnell Singers have made
‘a CD recordingiNA ZEMLE MIR
.(Peace on Earth)—of the sacred ch07
ral music of the Russian “Silver
‘Age.”

“The Russian Orthodox Church
forbids the use of musical instruments
“in worship,” John Stuhr-Rommereim
rexplains in the program of the new
ACD recording. “Thus, the human

voice remains the sole vehicle for
*musical expression."
x Russian choral music there is an
emphasis on unity, cohesion. and
‘nuance. It differs from Western Eu-
,ropean choral music in that there is
less stress placed on the indepen-
‘dence of sections of the choir. “Lis»
itening to such a choir, which funtions
‘with absolute cohesion. and carefully
shapes each nuance, one can have the
sense that it is the embodiment of the
human soul—and if anything distin-
guishes Russian choral music. is
'undoubtedly its soulfulness,‘ says
Stuhr-Rommereim.
Russian choral music was in full
r . .
ﬂower prior to the revolution of
4917. This was due, in part, to social
Jorces. After the emancipation of the
serfs in 1861.choral singing began to
'be used as an educational tool by the

»

progressive upper class. Vladimir
Morosah explained, “Through church
singing and the choral folk song, the
two types of music closest to the
populace, they felt they could help
the Russian people establish an inde-
pendent cultural identity."

By the end of the nineteenth cen-
tury,Russia’smusical pastwas being
rediscovered as part of an emerging
culturalself-awamess. Acmcirilevent
in this reawakening was the publicar
tionin1869ofDmitriRazumovsky's
Church Singing.

The “New Russran School"
emerged. and the composers of this
school “attempted to capture the na-
tional ﬂavor afancientRiissian chant
but. at the same time, they enriched
the tradition with an ‘orchestral’ ap-
proach to choral part-writing.”

The period of the “New Russian
School"ithe ﬁrst two decades of
the twentieth century—has been la—
baled by some as Russia’s “Silver
Age." Alexander Kastalsky was in
the vangaurd of this movement. Two
major works to come out of the new
school were Divine Liturgy (per
formed by the Grinnell Chorus in the
spring of 1989) and the Ali-Night
Virgil, by Sergei Rachmaninov.

in the years following the revolu—
tion the Soviet regime attempted to
suppress Russia’s spiritual impulse,

and in doing so nearly destroyed the
tradition of sacred choralmusic. Only
recently in the former Soviet Union
has the heritage of sacred choral mu-
sic been embraced again.

Vladimir Morosan and his pub-
lishingcompany,MusicaRussiea,are
now involved in recording the col-
lected works of all the major Russian
pre-Revolutionary composors of 3a
cred choral music, With his help, the
Grinnell choral department produced
their recording of works by Kastalsky.
"the material on this recording will
eventually appear in Morosan‘s
Monuments ofRusst'ari ChoralMuric
series.

“Because most westemers are rela~
tively ignorant of Russia‘s musical
history,“ Stuhr~Rommereim explains,
“it is easy to forget that Russia's
musical tradition extends back al-
most a millenium. Russia’s musical
heriLage is as vast as its landscape."

A copy of the Grinnell choral en—
sembles’ CD recording can be ob
tained at the Fine Arts Ofﬁce or the
College Bookstore for $8.95.
The selections sung by the Grinnell
Singers were recorded in the spring
of 1990. Those sung by the Grinnell
Community Chorus were recorded in
the spring of 1991.

John Stuhr-Rommereim is the di~
rector of both ensembles.

enty years afterhis death,everyknown
one of these prints was published as a
set by Baldwin and Cradockt, and
until Spring Break, every known one

Among the many insults to British
culture and politics included in this
collection is a caricature of the politi-
cian and rake John Wilkes. complete
with crossed eyes and tipsy “Liberty”
sign. Angered by this depiction ofhis
friend,the poetCharles Churchillsoon
after wrote an epistle declaring that
the caricature should be disregarded,
as the artist, Hogarth, was of “un-
sound mind."

This declaration inspired
Hogarth’s “Bruiser" series, in which
Churchill is depicted as a giddily
drunken bear, with beer flask in one
paw and a club inscribed repeatedly
with the word "Lye" (Le. “lie") in the
other. Hogarth's own dog, Trump, is
etched in the foreground, urinating
on the epistle.

rangement, but in place of the artist’s
palette is now drawn a cartoon in

catures of both Churchill and Wilkes

On a more serious note is the etch-
ing of Simon Lord Lovat. leader of a
group of Highland Chiefs who at~
tempted to restore me Stuarts to the
throne. He was tried and sentenced to
death in 1747, but not before Hogarth
travelled to see him and drew his
portrait.

The majority of this collection,
however. is not political. Hogarth
actually had little interest in politics,

makers that is"enough to makeaman
