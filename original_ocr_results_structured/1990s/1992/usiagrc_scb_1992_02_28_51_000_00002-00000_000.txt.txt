stresses ability
to lead campus

Apart from the President’s role as
liaison between students’ concerns
and those of the administration. it is
also the President‘s responsibility to
guide the student body through hard
times. In order for these duties to be
effectively fulﬁlled. the President
must have good communication with
students and administrators and must
be aware of the available resources
on campus. AsaStudent Advisor, the
Academic Coordinator of Concerned
BlackStudents,amember of the Comr
mittee on Student Life, a member of
the Student Staff Selection Commit-
tee, and a member of Common
Ground, I have developed the leader-
ship skills which are necessary to
accomplish these tasks.

As a person in leadership posi»

tions, I have be

come aware of the

students' concerns

on campus, I have

learned to listen to
thedifferentvoices

of ourstudentbody, ‘

arid l have leamed

to act on their con-

cerns. For example, at the end of last
year, I became aware of the college’s
plan todrop summerprograms which
recruited minority students Upon
hearing this news, I wrote a letter to
PresidentGeorge Drake stressing the
importance of these programs. Un-
fortunately, I did not receive a reply.
However, my actions did not stop
there. The following year, a close
friend and I brought the proposal to

the Multi-Ethnic Coalition. As a
group, we took our concerns to Presi-
dent Pamela Ferguson. Not all of our
demands were met, but there was
progress. Presently, the college is
expanding on one of the summer pro-
grams and is in the process of bring~
ing back the other two.

As a presidential candidate, I have
researched the different channels
which are open to students. In doing
this, I have found that some of the
established programs on campus are
not being utilized, For example, the
Office of Community Rights Media-
tion Team has not been used in two
years! If elected, I will better inform
students of their resources on cam-
pus. Also, I will serve as a resource
myself in helping the campus com
munity use what is already available
to it Rather than limiting my focus to
new programs. I will also promote the
use of existing programs. Why should
the Presidentonlyconcentrate on new
programs when established and po-
tentially effective programs are being
neglected?

Yes, SGA needs new ideas and a
committed President. However, italso
needsa leader who is willing to do the
necessary footwork to see if ideas are
feasible. I have already shown this
commitment through my campaign
and my concern for this campus.

‘ intent posted aroundcarnpus for more

Wohlauer aims to:

increase

student

quality of life

Howdy, myname is Ben Wohlauer
and I’m ninning for SGA President. I
have decided to dedicate the time to
do this because I believe that life at
Grinnell is not what it has been, and
should be, The quality oflife appears
to be rapidly deteriorating as discon-
tent amongSt the student body be-
comes more and more apparent. With
swastikas repeatedly appearingon the
dorm doors, and RAs and SAs work
ing overtime and bemoaning the dis-
integration of“cnmpus health,” how
can any Grinnell student not be con-
cerned with the disquieting atmo-
sphere that has settled over campus?

While I don’t claim to have the
answers yet. I pledge that if elected I
will dedicate my-
self to getting back
in touch with the
student body and
finding out what
ails it. Ibelieve that
the students of
Grinnell are lack-
ing their rightful
opportunity to air
their viewson cam-
pus life. With this
in mind. I would
want to keep the
ofﬁce of President
and the entire SGA
apparatus open and
responsive to all
ideas and concerns.

In addition, I plan
to bring SGA to the
student body by reinstatingSGA study
breaks, arranging open forums on rel-
evant issues, and publicizing and
working more closely with the com-
mittees already in place to deal wtth
student life issues.

Another idea is to try and rectify
the situation in the dorms. It seems
that dorm unity and pride have sig-

nificantly dwindled in the past fey?
years. To change this, I would overz.
haul the HAC position to try and
make it more desirable in hopes of
attracting more people who could
spark creativity in the dorms and cre-
ate Hall Activities committees that
would come up with events to rally
the dorm behind. Along these same
lines, Iwould attempt to change ACE
with the hopes of giving it a greater
ability to inspire more creative and
popular events.

I realize that these ideas are just
that, and thatall my plans and desire;
will add up to nothing ifcontaet with
the student body is anything but con‘
stant. After all, it’s the students. not,

SGA, and certainly not the adminis.
nation, who know what’s best for
Grinnell. If you agree that students‘
could change things around and thae
weshouldshould be given thechance

to do so: vote Ben Wohlauer and let
him give that chance
