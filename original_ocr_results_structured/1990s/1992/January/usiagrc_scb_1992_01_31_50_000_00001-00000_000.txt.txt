Bar's future in question

. Disgruntled owner unexpectedly shuts down

By Chris Maag

The Bar officially closed at about
2:15 on the morning of Saturday,
December 14, 199i ,afterfifteen years
of business. Nine people and count-
less nimors were put out into the
street.

Stories have ranged from those of
drunken bartenders standing by as
patrons rummaged through the cash
drawer,tothatofthebarowner,Larry
Bryan,cominginafterclosingtimeto
find the place packed to capacity with
partying college students and going
into a rage, throwing everyone out
and closing the place for good.

Bryan did come down that early
morning alittleafter2:00,apparently
stoppingofftotalkwithlimboSadler,
the owner of the Bar’s pizza shop. He
then proceeded to throw the six re-
mainin g employees and three of their
friends out, breaking a beer bottle and
a cue stick overthe bar in theprocess.
As they were hurrying out, Bryan
yclled,"This bar is Closed!"

“It was exactly like every other
weekend, The people working for
limbo were a little slower than usual

, , \

getting everything cleaned up, but
nothing was really out of the ordir
nary,“ said student body president
Matt Stippich, who worked as a bar-
tender for four months. “There were a
coupleofguys there who weregiving
rides home to some of the people
working. A few of the workers and
them were playing pool, and that’s
when Larry came in."

"One day he says
he's going to open it
back up, the next he

doesn’t”

<Jimbo Sadler

The former employees are now
left wondering just what happened
on thatparticularnighttocauseBryan
to close the bar so abruptly, but each
saysthatBryan had beenplanningfor
a while to close the Bar.

”1 had overheard him say some-
thing to the effect of he wanted to
close the place dowtt a couple of
weeks before,” said Bob Reason. an-

other bartender and a senior at Grin-
nell, “Maybe the stolen money gave
him an excuse.”

A week before the Bar closed, it is
believed that a non-employee stole
money from the bag which held that
night’s receipts, The bag was being
kept on a shelf behtnd the counter.
Also, Sadler was planning to move
his pizza business out of the bar on
December 20, switching ltto Bryan’s
new State Street location. Workers at
the bar say these are possible reasons
for the bar’s closing. Bryan declined
to comment.

A legal action has recently been
brought against Bryan by one of his
former employees, The former Ear
worker, who wishes to remainanony-
mous, is now unable to collect unem-
ploymentbenefits because of the way
in which she was fired from herjob.
The action goes to court on Wednes-
day.

The night the bar closed, several ,

employees heard Bryantcll Sadlcrto
be prepared to move his equipment
out as well. In fact. no equipment or
furniture has as yet been moved out
by either Stttllcr or Bryan, So what is
to become of the place?

“Honestly, it seems like he's
[Bryan] about fifty/fifty on re-open»
ing itor keeping itclosedr Oneday he
says he‘s going to open it back up, the
next he doesn't,” said Sadler.
