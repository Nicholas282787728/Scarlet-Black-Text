Second chance for hall council

In order to “reaffirm self—gover-
nance on campus,” Dean of Student
Affairs Torn Crady plans to reinstate
the system of hall councils which
existed during the mid~eighties. Un»
der the system, an elected council
consisting of five members would
govern hall or dorm activities.

Under the old system, the council
consisted of a president, an elected
activities coordinator and three stu-
dent staff members. Crady mentioned
that the system worked well during
his two years as an Resident Advisor.

Yet in 1985. the hall council was

abolished in favor ofthe present Hall
Activities Coordinator system. Aer
cording to Crady, the new system
would not eliminate the HAC posi-
tion. Instead, the position would be
filled via hall elections. Crady added
that HACs would still bear the same
responsibilities and undergoe the
same training. The status of the hall
senator has not yet been decided.
Under the hall council, the hall presi-
dentcarriedoutduties similartothose
of a senator. Crady hinted that the
position of the senator may be pre-
served, but gave no reason why.

He added that the remaining three
positions on the hall council were to

be ﬁlled by nonrstudcnt stall indi-
viduals. According to Crady. student
staff already has ample responsibility
within the hall. He continued. saying
that by electing non-student staffina
dividuals, overall participation is in-
creased.

The reintroduction ofthehall counr
oil is oneof the measures proposed by
Student Affairs for “reemphasis and
refocus on hall community.” Others
measures include a late night coffee-
house being constructed near iomter
Gardner lounge. Crady summed up
his sentiments by saying “my feeling
is that it will be a positive semester.”
