One tends to think that the pure

facts with accuracy. This, however.
is not the essence ofjournalism. The
mere listing of facts, datesand num
bers that answers to the questions
“Who, where, when, what, why,
how," does not constitute a piece of
news. This holds in exactly the same
way, that the mere listing of dates.
numbers. facts. and names does not
constitute history. until one brain—-
that of the historian—puts them to

It is important for me to explain
this seemingly commonscnsc char-

event, or an audio recording of a
speech and so forth. This, though,
would not make enough sense to the
person responsible for the public’s
infomation, for it would not involve
the faculty which prompLs the jour-
nalist to provide the public with in-
formation. In brief, this faculty is the
creative power of the writer to com-
pose the news story in such a way so
as to make it have a certain “align-
ment"; a certain amount of corre
spondence to the writer’s philosophi-
cal standpoint, which is the ultimate

Who was Yankel Rosenbaum?

To the editor:

On August 19, 1991 inthe Crown
Heights section of New York City,
anti-Jewish riots, touched offbyacar
accident involving a Jewish driver
hitting anti k’ ling a sevcnrycarrold
black child.claimcd thelike onankeI
Rosenbaum. Rosenbaum,a29-ycar»
old Jewish doctoral student from
Australia, was attacked and stabbed
to death by a gang of black youths
yelling “Kill nielcw." Rosenbauin's
onlyconncction With the car accident
was that he ws Jewish. Thc murder
and riots ihatcnsued in the followmg
days were clearly motivated by eth-
nic hatred. People throw stones at
lcwmh houses, burncd lsrlteli llztgs,

atcly following the murder, Lenirick
Nelson was identified by the dying
Rosenbautn,ttnd later confessed twice
to ttic police.

On OctoberZ‘), l992,ayury con-
sisting ofsix blacks, four Latinos and
two whites found Nelson not guilty
on all charges. According to the New
Yuri: Timex, Nelson’s lawyer sugr
gestcdthat“undcrpressurefromJewr
ish groups, police officers from three
precincts, the medical examiner’s
office, and medical experts all
colluded to frame Mrs Nelson.” The

accusation ofa Jewish conspiracy is a
common tactic used tojustify hatred
targeted allows. The fact thatjiistice
was not served in this case sltould not
come as a complete surprise. The
e of Rodney King iii Los Angeles
this past spring made all too clear the
inadequacy anti failure ofouryusttce
system.
Perhaps equally as disturbing as

the verdict itself ts the apparent apa-
thy and lack of reaction among the
general public as a whole and the
Grinnell College campus in purliCuV
lar. This past spring, we found the
eatnpus‘ strong response to tire King
verdict ooui necessary and Justified.
But after the Rosenbaum verdict, we
lound that only a handful of students
had even heard of the murder, The

lack of knowledge can only be parr
Lially blamedon an uninterestedpress.
When a person is murdered solely
bccause of his race of religion, all
people must condemn that act. A
failure of ourjusticc system necessir
tates a public outcryiregardlcss of
the victims or the attackers.

To the editor:

I am writing in response to the
Novi 6 article by Kimstantinos
Ktimbouroglou on the topic of the
city council meeting at which the
issue of harassment was discussed.

I think the textof the article was
both fun and acciirlttc, hilt i |cc| dtc
choice of headline, “City Coun-
nieeting on harassment not promi
mg,” and the final statement were
unfortunateaudalsodonotrcliectthe
council‘s rcnl determination to lake
the issues of harassmentand mmlcrr
ance very seriously.

Overcoming stereotypes, misinA
formation, deeply rooted prejudices
and, indeed, complacency is a comA

plea task We must simultaneously
keep the cnrgy ofour passionate mm.
mittncnt to out while retaining
patienccs and mental clarity that will
permit us to find truly creatiie and
pruductiycciiucuiionat and legal ptulis
to combatting prejudice and increas»
ing sensitivity to {lIVCL y.

What I believe we need is
conccnxiis building, sharing of per-
spectives, and a lot of mutual
cncouragnicnt to achieve what we all
scck—usnt'er,incre Opcndnoretolcn

seize this opportunity to transform
the awful experience of those who

suffered harassment into positive en-
ergy for improvmg our community.

The Female
Factor --not
the Hillary
Factor

 

 

Aida Ruilova

For weeks during the campaign,
Hillary Clinton was the focus ofmuch
attention and scrutinty from the politi-
cal opposuion who sought to painther
as mongering feminist with no family
values to speak of, Why',l The answer
is SlmpiC. Hillary Clinton is asuccess
ful, accomplished woman

Thetcrrn, Hillary Factor, refcrrtx‘l
tothequestionoiwhcllterornotHillary
Clinton would hinder or help her
husband’s chances in the election. In
other words. would the fact thatsheis
a noted professional 7 recognized in
her field — hinder the image of the
traditional first family? The message
underlying this question is both sad
anddangerousitis theaccusation that
has been lashed out to all women who
have careers separate from the home.
ltisdirectcd notonly to HillaryClinton
but towards all females who do not
embody the traditional molds of want»
anhood,

There is nothing wrong with a
woamn who stays home with her chil-
dren, if that is what she chooses to do.
There is nothing wrong with the insti-
tution of the First Lady as being “the
most antiquated model of American
Womanhood" Barbara Bush was cer-
tainly the epitome of the traditional
First Lady. But, there is something
terribly wrong when a woman who
steps outside these roles is reproached.

There should be nothing wrong
with a woman who chooses to work
outside of the home. It should not
mean that she doesn't her children or
her farnily a high priority. A woman
dedicated to her career can be just as
dedicated to her children and husband.
Sadly enough, a woman's success out-
side of the home is often seen as de-
struclive to her role as an effective
mother. This View does not Seem to
hold true for men, The fact that they
have carech does not exclude thepos-
stbility of them being good tathcrs.

But. there is a prevailing ncgativc
image of women wtdi careers. The
problem is that for women, the two
factors — career and home—seem to
cancel each other out 7 women can
have one but not the other. if a woman
is aggresswethcn shccannotbcsweet
if a woman has a career then she can
not be an effective mother. Moreover.
a woman who is aprofcssmna] is often
assumcdto beinscnsitivc.unfeminine.
and unlikablc. A woman is not one-
dintcnstonal. We can be good mothers
and successful business people, We
can be ambitious and still be tender.

Its time that the Hillary Ciinions
ofthe world are applauded rather than
criticized for their accomplishments.
it's time to recognize that there is no
logic insaying that a woman's success

ing idea.
