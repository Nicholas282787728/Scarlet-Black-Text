Oregon and other states to vote on
antigay legislation this Tuesday

by Katya Ricketts

Next Tuesday, Novcmhet 3, the
CllchnS 01 Oregon will be voting on
leg aLiOH that restricts the rights of
people based on their sexual oricnlu»
tron, Tlte Oregon Cititcns Alliance
(OCA) has proposed Ballot Measure
Nine to be amended to the Oregon
State constitution, (Sec inset.) Simi-
lar legislation will also be voted on in
Colorado, Maine, and Florida.

The Grinnell College
Community‘sconcem forBallorMea-
sure Nine is essentialr If enacted,
there is no telling how far the implica-
Lions could reach The direct effects
to the gay, lesbian. and bisexual citi-
zens of Oregon could include losing
jobs, especially teaching positions,
and loss of access to AIDS health
services

The possibility of Ballot Mea~
sure Nine passing is greater than one
might expect. In 1988, the state of
Oregon paged OCA’sMeasureEight,
which eliminated an executive order
previouslyissued by Oregon’sDemo-
cratie governor Neil Goldschmidt
which prohibited antigayemployment
discriminan'on in state government

This is just one example of how
the threat to civil righs of gays and
lesbians is real. Already in Oregon,
two gay activists have been killed in
the conflictover Measure Nine. Leg-
islation likeMeasureNine entourages
and permits such violent and inhu-
mane acts. If passed, Measure Nine
could also provide justiﬁcation for
crimes against the community and
persons perceived as gay or lesbian.

3, Write letters to the editor tint]
call your local paper about their cov-
erage of Mcasure Nine. Many par
pcrs’ coverage has been brief and
misinformed.

4. Call the Oregon Department
ofTourism at (800) 547-7842and tell
them you were planning a vacation

not visit if Measure Nine passes.

5. You can also send money to
the No On Nine campaign at PO Box
3343 .Porlland, OR, 97208, (503) 232-
4501. Your support of the No On
Nine campaign is cmcial. In the
event that Measure Nine passes, No
On Nine will be able to ﬁght to over-
turn it in higher courts, Given the
Reagan/Bush ﬂavor of all state sue
preme courts and the national one,
there is NO guarantee that Measure
Nine will be found unconstitutionalr

Each and every one of us has the
responsibility to ﬁght against vio-
lence and hate. Measure Nine is just
oneissue. The fact that MeasureNine
has been proposed means that there
are people who are planning on re
stricting other people's liberties.
Therefore it is essential that we stand
up and be counted because our num»
bers are limited. By letting Measure
Nine pass, we encourage countless
levels of oppression. Our opposition
can tum thctideagainstthisandothcr

you don’t, who will?
