Townies: The Myth and Beyond

by Konstantinos

Kambouroglou
(Note: the use of the word
“townie” in this article is
conventional and in no way
does it express the writer’s
feelings towards Grinnell's
residents.)

To the freshman,
Grinnell, Iowa seems like a
very peaceful little town, full
of friendly old people:
Cuningham‘s, the Comer~
stone shop, the lovely ladies
at the bank, the bakery.
Within the first few weeks,
though, the image of the town
changes dramatically as the
“townies‘” presence is felt.
One can see them in various
places: the lS—year-olds
riding their BMX’s and their
skateboards in Barber Plaza;
the high school upperclass~
men hanging out around
Pag’s or cruising around the
central block; older ones in
State Street Station and the
bowling alley.

A good question is:
What is a townie and how is
he different from normal
Grinnell residents? Well,
townies have some constitu-
tional characteristics: First of
all, they are generally of
young age (about 1530) and
mostly male. Downtown they
will hardly ever come across
a student without giving him
a bad look—to say the least.
When it snows, they will
drive around campus and
splash students with yucky,
muddy snow (fact, I prom-
ise). They will walk in the
Ioggia late at night and beat
up students and vandalize the

vending machines. They will

townies as homophobic

set their dog loose, to attack a peeple, not deserving our

student. They will drive
around town intimidating

every student they see.

OK, so townies are
just violent punks who “ac—
tively dislike” the students
and that’s all there is to it?
I’m afraid that I have to
disagree. In the past few days
I’ve discussed the “town/
gown” issue with several of
our young enemies. I asked
them about their feelings
towards the college and its
students and here are the
interesting results: Younger
townies (15-17) in the ice»
cream place next to Pag’s
gladly discussed the issue.
They explained how they
have no basic problem with
the college. In fact it would
even sound like a good deal
to them, were they allowed to
use the campus facilities
more. (Note that for this age
group, facilities are the
Forum game room and the
PEC, as opposed to the AV
Center or the library), There
are, however, some issues
that young townies are Cone
cerned about, Such is the fact
that in our college‘s commu»
nity there are—or at least
seem to be—a lot of openly

homo- or bisexual people. To

the question ”what’s wrong
with gay and bi people?" the
answer was a disappointing
“nothing, as long as they stay
away from us.” Alien and
offensive to our campus as
this approach may be, it is
not, in my opinion, strong
enough a reason to condemn

sympathy. The reason for
this opinion is that
homophobia is a condition
mainly caused by the lack of
information, for which, the
residents of a small commu—
nity like Grinnell are hardly
responsible. In fact for
the record, one of them
mentioned the particular case
of a friend of his who was
sexually harassed by a homo—
sexual student. Of course, I
immediately mentioned to
them last year’s incident in
the Forum, when a gay
student was harassed. Their
reply was that the case in»
volved older townies (and
they were correct) and that it
is because of incidents like
this that they are not allowed
access to the game room and
that they too condemn acts of
this sort and so on. I ac-
cepted their point. As lesser
problems they mentioned the
fact that a lot of students are
from big cities and don’t
know that left turns are
allowed in Grinnell and thus
are trafﬁc hazards. I asked
them what wish they would
like me to extend to the
campus community and the
reply was “We wish they
didn’t walk in the middle of
the road” (point made).

At the comer of Broad

and 4th I met a couple of

older men. They seemed to be

in their twenties. It took a
second thought but I ap
proached them: “Hi! I’m
writing an article for the
8&8, the college newspa-

per...” “We know, we
know,” they inten—upted.
“Would you like to talk about
your feelings towards the
college and its students?"
“NO! Not now!” they replied
with obvious irony, but
immediately proceeded to
answer. Throughout the
conversation I found out that
one of them was a 30year-
old pure Grinnellian and the
other, a Zleyear—old who has
been in Grinnell for about
four years. From themI
heard the most interesting
things: It’s true that a reason
for townies not to like the
students is that in general,
students of such a highly
ranked college are more
privileged than they are.
This, however, does not mean
that there is an imperative
feeling of hatred that exists
within townies. In fact, the
interesting part is that I was
reassured that all townies
wish the townegown relations
were good. The problem is
more complicated.

First, there is the
small town effect: people
generally don’t like strangers,
even from Iowa, especially
from Newton! This effect is
ampliﬁed by the racial diver-

sity of our campus. The older

guy said that things are not
the way they were ten years
ago, when students and
townies lived in perfect
harmony. “You see," he said,
“back then, once you were a
student you belonged to the
town because you belonged
to the college, which was a
part of it." “And what is the

case now? Aren’t you people
in any way proud of this
college? I came all the way
from Greece to study here!"
The answer was interesting:
“Yes, but the college used to
be ranked in the top four in
the nation; now it’s down to
10 or 15. Man, things are not
the way they were ten years
ago. I wish things were the
same. Some of the best
parties I’ve ever been to here
were college parties. My
father used to work there; I’d
sure like things to be the way
they used to be. I don't know
if the students admitted have
changed, but I can tell you
one thing: it wasn’t like this
ten years ago.”

With this we ended
our brief discussion; the
townies went off to party,
leaving me troubled. Pleasant
as it is to hear that the “bad”
townies in reality have no
problem with the college and
its students, I can’t help
wondering if the deteriorarion
of town-gown relations came
partly as a result of the
townies respect for the col-
lege. These words “...things
are not the way they used to
be...” might be more than just
an observation. I would like
to leave this point open. I
expect everyone who cares
about this college, to seri—
ously consider these words.
Maybe Grinnell College is
really losing something it had
ten years ago. Is this some,
thing uality that is reﬂected in
the narional rankings or a
coincidental shift of character
of the campus community?

In any case, what’s certain is
that the college is “losing“ the
young people of its own
hometown; and they’re very
good people, too. (Trust me,
I’ve talked to them.) So the
next time they drive by you
and splash you with yucky,
muddy snow, well, just have
a laugh,
