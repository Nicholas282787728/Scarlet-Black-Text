espoused anti-imperialism, this
episode raises a carefully over-
looked issue: imperialism pracc
ticed by blacks to the detriment
of other blacksr One of the
U.N.’smanymora1 failings has
been its failure to address this
issue. It seems to believe that
only Europeans are capable of
racism, sexism, and imperial-
ism. In another brilliant (if poe
litically incorrect) book, The
Birth of the Modern: World
Society 181571830, published

last year, Paul Johnson duly
explodes this lie.

In Johnson’s book we
learn about some of the prac-
tices and beliefs of non-west-
ern societies: beliefs and prac-
tices that would disgust west—
ern liberals, who are precisely
the people who clamor so pass
sionately for
“multiculturalism." We learn
that these societies were every
bit as violent and racist and
imperialist as the west was even
before the advent of liberalism.

We learn, for example,
that in the early nineteenth cene
tury, under King Bodawpaya,

tion, said Parson, a junior
doublevmajoring in Math and
Economics. “We were just a
piece of paper in the SGA ﬁling
cabinet. We started out with
about 15 people. Presently, we
have 79 people who have ex
pressed interest in joining."

VoicingtheRepubliean
option hasn’t always been easy
at Grinnell, according to Fos—
ter.

“Our official dealings
with the President of the cola
lege and the student govem-
ment have been very admi-
rable,” he said. “Some of the
attitudes of the students, how»
ever, is not as favorable. We do
get snide comments and other
remarks."

“While there are many
students who are willing to lis-
ten to us,” said Parson, “Many
have the attitude that they don’t
even want to talk to us because
of our political views. I want
people to decide whether they
want to talk to me based on my
personality, not my political
views."

People should vote Re-
publican this year because of
the economy, according to Fos»
ter.

“George Bush’s eco
nomic plans make more sense
than Clinton’s,“ he said.
“Bush’s plans are cut and dried

and will ease the tax»burden on
allof America. Rightnow there
are people living in poverty,
andBush’splan will aide them.
On the other hand, Clinton
raises taxes and adds to our
national debt. He also has no
plans to balance the budget."

For Parson, making
government smaller and put-
ting more power into the hands
of the people is a reason to vote
for Bush.

“I would invite liberals
to come talk to me personally
about why to vote Republican,”
saidParson. “Idon‘thavetime
here to tell my 10 to 20 pages of
reasons."

Other activities the
Grinnell Republicans are plan—
ning include a possible debate
with the Grinnell Democrats
and aRepublican victory party,
scheduled for the weekend af-
ter the November election.
