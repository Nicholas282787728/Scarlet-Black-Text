Thanks for the memories

My dear readers, I’ve just been
informed that this will be the last S
and B of the semester, and thus the
last of my career as a Grinnell stu-
dent. I feel like I've been ordered to
leave the country by morning ~
startled. not ready to leave, needing
to say goodbye.

I’ve been writingabl-weeklycol-
umn for two years now. I must say it
is one of my most important extra-
curricular activities. This column
gives metheopportunitytospeak my
mind and be heard. In my student
groups I feel like I am affecting the
students around me, but when I see
my writing in dleSurldB,l know that
people all over campus and possibly
scatteredtltroughoutlhecountryhave
the opportunity to see my thoughts, to
know what‘s imponant to me.

Pardon my mush, but I deserve it,
dammit. I’d like to take this opportu»
nity to thank all the students. faculty,
and staff who've ever read my col-
umn and lelme know that they apprc»
ciated it. I think I’ve had some sort of
response to every single column I’ve
written, from people I don‘t know to
close friends to Mike Kent. Every

Alanna Walen

response makes the feel like I’m not
alone, validates my feelings, makes
me proud of my ability to effectively
communicatemythoughts.Don‘tever
doubt the power of the press, my
friends.

I’d also like to take this opportu-
nity to be optimistic. I can't tell you
how glad I am that I came to Grinnell
College.Iknowlhall'vebllchedabout
various aspects of thc college. and
generally about how confusing life
can be. But I know for sure that my
life is infinitely better than it would
have been iflhad gone tothe30,000-
student state school that was my al-
temative.

Throughout my pre-adolescent
years, I was a “gifted“ child and a
social reject. In high school I leamed
torebel,butquietly.Rememberwhen
wearing slightly odd clothes would
get you a repumtion as a trouble-
maker? AtGrinnell, I learned how to
think about what bothered me about
oursociety. whatl should do aboulil,
and how I should go about doing it. I

have had the opportunity to lead stu-
dent groups. I have taken on huge
personal responsiblllties, and I have
succeeded. I have become an effcce
tive changermaker. Two weeks from
now, for at least a little while, I will
consider myself educated.

If nothing else. college has taught
me that there’s always more to learn.
Idon’tknow Lhatlwillbe embarking
on the project of learning more and
more anytime in the near future - I
think I‘ll be content tojustgctby for
it while, learn some small lessons.
Make money. Pay rent, Buy food.
Experience spare time. Enjoy life.
I’ve lezlmed an awful lot, but some-
times I think I'vc forgotten about the
basics.

I think I'll be fine without Grinr
nell, the place. I'm looking forward
to being in a town where I can find
cool stores and cultural events with-
outan hour’s drive. What I will miss
is the people, all the professors, staff,
and younger students who havemadc
the last four years so entirely produce
tiveandenjoyablc. Thank youall for
being yourselves. Keep up the good
work.

 

FRIENDLY FIRE

A Tzadik at Grinnell College

Rabbi Berg looks at me with a
glare that leaves me halfway between
laughing and cringing. So in other
words, I look studious.

“The most important thing in life
is not to love your neighbor," he be—
gins in a heavy stereotypical accent,
“the important thing is to love the
stranger.“ Itisa favoritephrase of his.

"To love thc stranger is more imr
porlztnt than almoSt anything else. It
is forbidden in the Talmud to forgo
Torah study to attend the funeral of a
parent, butan exception is made for
the funeral ofa Stranger.”

I have been studying Talmud (the
Jewish book of laws. logic and phl-
losophy) once a week wtth Rabbi
Berg in a small group for the better
part of the semester. We've finished
about three pages of actual Talmud,
but we've learned volumes. He con-
tinltcs his line of logic.

“of course you can take that too
far, like Dahmer or Manson." For
some reason a lesson seldom passes
wtthout mention of at least one cone
victcd l'clotl.”Thcy loved somepcople
so much they had to kill them. That’s
not what the Talmud is talking about.
That's evil. Iflhc stranger you meet IS
a Dahmer or a Manson, you should
love them, but not too closeup."
Modern logic from an ancient text.

The spittle flies outofhis mouth as
he ﬁnishes his statement and lowers
his head to look at the large Talmud
sitting in front of him. He begins to
read, chanting the words first in He-
brew and then in English, In this one
hour between lunch and classes, I am

Josh Ford

able to forgetthe tests. the papers. the
grammar police, the profs, the meet-
ings and get lostin his rhythms, tn the
question and answer, in counterques-
lions and counter answers. It is not
thatlam extremely religious, itisjust
the incredibly strange feeling you get
when you are actively in pursuit of
some truth or knowledge for which
you gain no academic crcdit, The
registrar gives you credit for master-
ing the Pythagorean theorem, butnot
forslmply learning the logic of“love

the stranger."

Rabbi Berg launches into another
verse. Somehow he ends up talking
aboutRyan Sandberg‘ssalary(rabbis
are a bit like your typical columnists,
both eventually end up approaching
baseball on a spiritual level), “twenty
eight million dollars to play base-
ball." He nods his head slowly and
stares off into space. It is like watchr
ing a hummingbird pause fora mo
ment to contemplate the flowers,“I-Ie
makes more in a week than I makeall
year." He exhalcs and buzzes back to
his Talmud.

EYES WIDE

IwaswalkingaroundbcingaDyke
the other day and.. .. There are really
far too many things that need to be
impartedtothemassesdtisweek.The
end isnigl'l, whatever thatmeans,and
I have so much I need to tell you.
There are tar too many things going
on around campus. It‘s May, though,
and May isalwaysllkethat.Remem-
her that, May is nationwide stress
'month. ltyust is.

This whole rape thing has really
turned me inside out. I distance my—
self from the whole overrorganized
machinery ofitnow. It‘s far toomuch
for me. Please remember that the star
tistics are now that a women is raped
once every minute in this country.
Remember that a woman is probably
raped once every week on our cam-
pus. Is that too much for you? Re
member that aside of rape there is
verbaland emotionalabuse.Remem-
her that you are angry. Don’t lose
thaliil' you do you could lose your
power to move. Organization is good
when it directs you, not when it re-
stricts you. I remember every day
now, I keep seeing the faces of men
who have hurt wimmin. I keep hear-
ing the voices ofhurt wimmin. Daily.
Everywhere I go I ﬁnd the faces of
men for whom I have no pity. None.
Forget that wimmin are socialized to
be Weak and men are socialized to be
strong. Fly past that watered»down
excuscfor sexual violence. Don’tbuy
itforaminute.Coming back from the
Yom Ha’Shoah observance, I won-
derifyearsfromnowpeoplewillsay,
“I didn’t know it was happening. I
didn‘t know all those wimminiand
men—were being tortured every day."
It’s so easy not to see. See and re-
member.

Ah ,butthis is far too much for our
little sheltered minds. Try this one on
for size: Political Correctness is a
myth. Whoa. I recently saw a lesbian
comedian in Amos and a member of
the audience asked her for an opinion
ton PC. I appreciated her response.

Remember to
remember

She said it reminded her of another
catch-phrase used to scare people
away from a goal that was true. She
said, “Remember the term ‘nigger-
lover’?” Couch something you be-
lieve in an insult. Does that mean I
can‘tflght7 Bereal.lsfightingracism
PC? No, but being highly tuned to
covert racism is. If I‘m against
heterosex ism does that makeme PC?

Only ifl expectpeople to listen to me
and take me seriously. Listen to the
people who complain most about
Political Correctness. Who are they?
Guessthreetimes.White mentWhiIe
men. White straight men. Have pity.
They face virtual extinction. They
fear losing power. Hell, they lose it
daily on this campus. Why do you
think it‘ssucha hotlopic. Aprofessor
has devoted signiﬁcant time and en—
ergy to prove that PC is nasty evil
bad. Hey, but he’s a hip dude. Sure.
Sorry, white women say it too. “I’d
never be caught dead with PC val-
ues." Remind me not to invite you to
my wedding. Or talk to you about
your classist attitudes. May the God-
dess forgive me if I stand up for the
rights of other people or myself.
Hey, but some people with differ-
ing opinions aren‘t getting a chance
to speak their minds! ll Since when, I
wonder. Don'twe haveenough limp»
liberal periodicals you can write for?
How about a regurgitative conserva-
tive tabloid? You can only write for it
if you can use“knee—jerk liberalism”
and“femi-nazi" in mesamesentence,
however. Play a sad song for the
thousand or so while men on this
Campusigay andstraightalikeMake
them feel better for not being more
feministminded. And remember,just
because you‘re queer, that doesn’t
mean you can’t be ajerk. Gay and Bi
