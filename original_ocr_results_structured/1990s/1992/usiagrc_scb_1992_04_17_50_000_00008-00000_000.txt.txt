Savage lovers perform

in Arena Theatre

By Jennifer Vacehiano

_—

Savage/Love, a short oneract play,
will be performed in the Arena The-
atre Friday evening and Saturday af-
ternoon, along with Alongside the
Night. The play, written by Sam
Shepard, is directed by senior
J ulieanne Ehre.

Sam Shepard, an American play-
wright, has wriuen over forty plays
including Buried Child which, in
1979, won the Pulitzer Prize for
Drama. Other works include Action,
Killer's Head, Suicide in B Flat, and
many more His mostrecent achieve-
ment was his screenplay which he
wrote for Wim Wenders’s
Paris,Texas, which won the Golden
Palm Award at the 1984 Cannes Film
Festival,

Savage/Love, written in collabo-
ration with Joseph Chaikin, is a play
aboutromanticlove.The two metand
talked ovcra three week periodabout
such things as "the difficulty of ex—
pressing tendemess, and the dread of
being replaced," for example.
Chaikin, in an introduction to the
script. explains, “We each feltthat we
wanted the piece to be easily and
readily identifiable, not esoteric. We
felt it should be made up of love
moments which were as immediately
familiar to most people in the audi-
ence as they were to Sam and me."

Because the play is made up of
such “love moments" as opposed to
the typical plot sequences of most
productions, Ehre faced challenges
in directing the play. The original
script has no speciﬁc characters and
no stage directions, which left her

virtually on her own when planning
the production. Ehre chose to have
the moments acted out by six charac-
ters, who will be played by Heather
Coares, Carlos Ferguson, Thomas
Meglioranza, Helen Neumann, Amy
Smith, and Jennifer Stokelyi

Thecharactersactoutvai-iouslove
moments in the lives of people such
as “first moment," “watching the
sleeping lover," and “Savage.” Ehrc
describes the play as an ensemble
piecc,snyingthat“lhcrcarcnoswsi
everyone really works together.“ At
times, she explains, the play seems
almost a documentary with all the
characters speaking about their dif-
ferent experiences.

What is interesting about the cast
of Ehre’s production is that they all
have minimal or no previous acting
experience, Because of the nature of
the play, the lack ofacting experience
in some ways served to beneﬁt rather
than hinder the production. ”it was
exciting to work with them because
the play is so real, so honest,” Ehrc
explains, “They are not trying to be
real actors—they arejust real people
in real situations."

From this directing experience
Ehre says that she has “learned to
trust actors more#trust them to be
able to create things without having
to give step by step instructions."The
actors, she explains. were given a lot
of freedom to create their roles. “In
stead of coming in and saying, OK,
this is what I want, id say, OK, let’s
try this—I shaped what they gave me
rather than bringing in deﬁnite ideas
