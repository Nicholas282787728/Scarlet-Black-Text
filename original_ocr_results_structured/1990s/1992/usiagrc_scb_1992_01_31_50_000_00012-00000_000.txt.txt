Men's basketball Win
streak hits five games

by Jeff Winz

The Men's Basketball team ex
tended their winning streak to five
games with big wins against Buena
Vista, Beloit, and Mount St. Clare.
The streak improved their record to
6-6 overall and 3-3 in conference
play.

Grinnell used a strong defense,
good fastbreaks and excellent 3 point
shooting to jump out to a42—2S half»
time lead overB uena Vista. The game
wasarematch oflhePioneer’s 3 point
loss to Buena Vista on November 22
and Grinnell wanted to even the se~
ties. The game was never really close
as the Pioneers won handily, 7861.
Coach Arseneault gave credit to the
players for "taking it up a notch and
overall improvement since the begin-
ning of the season," especially fresh-
man Steve Diekmann who lead all
scorers wilh20 points. Other double—

digit scorers were Todd Young with
19 points and Craig Studer with 14.

Arseneault got“the best win of his
career" last Saturday when Grinnell
beat Beloit, 7162. Lead by Young,
who was4 for4 from the 3 point line,
andwho scored lOconseculivepoinls
in the second half. Grinnell fought
back from a 9 point second half defi-
cit to win.

Arseneauit Commented, “Beloit
played a very good game, we just
played better," and this win pus the
team in a “who knows What Could
happen situation. We could go on a
run and get back into contention for
the conference title." Young paced
Grinnell with 21 pointsrfollowed by
Diekmann with 15, Studer with 14,
and Chris Jacobsen. who scored 13
points and grabbed 12 rebounds.

Jacobson had another big game
last Monday when Grinnell played
Mount St. Clare. He started the game

by scoring the Pioneers’ ﬁrst 8 points,
including a slam dunk, and finished
with 32 points and 9 rebounds.
Arseneault said the game “was an
emotional letdown after the Beloit
game.Weplayedpoorlybutstillwon,
which is a sign of a good team."
Grinnell led 38-25 at the half and
never looked back, eventully win~
ning 83-66. Diekmann and Studer
were also big contributors, scoring
19 and 12 points respectively.
Arseneault attributed the five-
game winning streak to better de-
fense.“Defensehasbeenthekey.it’s
created more offensive opportuni-
ties." Healso added thatlason Francl
and Chad Folsom have been unsung
heroes. “They have both been play-
ing great defense, rebounding well
and have been very unselfish team
players." The Pioneers will put their
streak on the line tomorrow at 3 pm.
in Darby Gymnasium against Coe.
