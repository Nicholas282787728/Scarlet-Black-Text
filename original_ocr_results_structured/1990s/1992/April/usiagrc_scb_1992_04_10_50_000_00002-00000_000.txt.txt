Bob's Underground up and running
New coffeehouse features Ben & Jerry's, ambiance

By Jesica Stretton

Ifyou’re totally sick of dorms and
the Fontm Grill. or need a late night
study break and wantaplace to hang,
go to Grinnell College‘s new coffee-
house: Bob’s Underground, the only
place to get cappuccino in town.

Bob’s Underground, named after
Tripod Bob the cat, is furnished with
booths, small tables, and couches.
and is very mellow and relaxing. The
overallcolor is green: turquoise walls,
funky green shaded-lamps with
double gold bases, and two green
couches in the comer behind the bar.
The atmosphere isa lot more subdued
than the Grill, with “So Happy To-
gether” playing on the PolkAudio
speakersin thebackground and stools
around the bar so onecan sit and wait
for an order.

Except for pints of Ben 8t Jerry‘s,
peace pops, and cappuccino, which
cost $2.50,$t.25,and$1 respectively,
everything is under a dollar. Bob‘s

has ﬁve or six types of gourmet cof-
fee and alternates two special ﬂavors
aday. The specials on Tuesdaynight’s
opening were African Cinnamon and
HazelnutandCream. Regularcoffee,
espresso, ice tea, herbal tea and
Brueger's bagels with veggie orregu~
lar cream cheese are also available.
Smoking is allowed butcigarettes are
not sold.

After the initial startrup cost from
SGA of $4,000 and yet-to be donated
money from the student affairs office
, the coffeehouse is self sufficient,
and has seventeen employees who
are paid minimum wage. The hours
are 7:30 pm. to 2:00 am. every day,
plus 12:30 pm. to 4:30 pm. on Sun-
days. There is an eighty person car
pactly.

Wednesday night is open for pet"
fonnances and one can talk to man-
agement if interested in performing.
The jazz choir and the band
Stumbleweed are already scheduled.
Other than concerts, music is pro

videdbyaCDsystiemandGrinnellians
are encouraged to bring their own
CDs.

Besides music and food, also of
fered are: games, magazines, and art—
work. A chess board is set up in the
coffeehouse and other games can be
added. Although Bob‘s is equipped
with every magazine available from
the BackAlley Deli,itwillbesoonbe
getting subscriptions to other magae
zines fromDesMoines.Thewallsare
currently decorated with murals by
Helen Neumann and prints by Carlos
Ferguson. but the art work will be
replaced periodically by the art dc—
partmcnt. The coffeehouse’s back
passage way will soon be set up for
chalk drawing which can be Contian
ally changed.

is a student space and has a suggesr
tion box for all ideas, and also
