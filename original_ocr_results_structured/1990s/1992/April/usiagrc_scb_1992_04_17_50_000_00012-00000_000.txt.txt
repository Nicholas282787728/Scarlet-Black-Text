1570. In the ﬁrst game. senior Steve
“As Big As Your" Johnston held the
Siwash to six runs off of six hits in
the ﬁrst five innings. While the Pio-
neers kept a close pace, scoring four
runs off six hits in the first five in-
nings. Johnston began to fatigue and
loaded the bases in the sixth just be
fore a Siwash batter hit a grand slam.
Johnston allowed eleven runs to score
in six and one-third innings. Only
fourof those runs were earned. Coach
Patt Foster yanked Johnston and re-
placed him with sophomore Justin
“What‘s A" l-Iupfer. I-Iupfer put the
ball across the plate but did not have
the defense to back him up. Eight

throughout the game. A total of nine

The Pioneers looked like a new
team when they went up against the
Coe Kohawks Tuesday afternoon.
Each inning began with enthusiasm
and energy. Junior ace Mark “The

held the Kohawks scoreless and hit-
less for the first two innings. The

set to host Classic

By Cory Conover

Last weekend, the women’s uack
team traveled to Central College in
Fella, Iowa for the State small col-
lege meet. Coach Evelyn Freeman
experimanted with the groupings of
her runners as several of the long
distance women bumped their dis-
tances up with success.

Jessica Henry, usually running in
the 1000 and the 5000, competed in
the10,000 forthefiisttimeand placed
fourth. Coach Freeman said, “The
meet gave us the chance to ﬂy some
different events. Some of the women
ran longer races and for the mostpart
we came out ahead."

Missy Ebitz turned in a stellar per-
formance despiteadverseconditions.
In the discus and the javelin, she
placed ﬁfth while fighting both the
wind and slippery footing. Ebitz,
also a sprinter, teamed up with Kate
Peterson,Jennifer Jones and Melanie
Parson for a sixth place finish in the

4X100 relay.

When the dust had cleared and the
points were totaled, the womencttmc
out in ninth place in the field of thir-
teen.

For the Easter weekend, the
Grinnell women host the Grinnell/
Delong Classic, boasting almost800
athletes from 25 teams. “We‘re look;
ing forward to this meet. We’ll try
some different relays that we ordi-
narily don’t run to see ifwe can break
some school records,” said Freeman.

The distance medley, consisting
of an 800 followed by legs of 400,
1200, and 1600, isn’t normally a part
of their itinerary. buton Saturday the
Pioneers will be able to showcase
their talents. “Our long distance run—
ners haven’t gotten the chance to run
in a relay yet," continued Freeman.
Another record the women will be
gunning for is the 4x200, which will
feature the sprinters. Competition
Starts at9z30 in the morning and will
continue until about 7:00 pm.

Lehmann began the seventh inning

The game went into cxtm innings,
and the Pioneers needed desperately
to come up with some hits to give
Lehmann his first win of the season.
Unfortunately,theonlythingPioneer
batters came up with were outs.

In the eighth inning, Lehmann
forced the first Kohawk batter to
ground out to Ian “Ox" Carlson but

then lost his concenuation, walking , ‘

the second batter. The Coe runner
stole second base before Lehmann

threw the next Kohawk a pop ﬂy to ,
Carlson. Coach Foster then gave the '

sign to intentionally walk the next
batter to bring up Coe‘s cleanup hilr
ter, whom Lehmann had dominated
all day long. Unfortunately, the Coe
batter singled to left, pushing in the
winning run. Grinnell ended up los-
ing the game 4-3. Even though
Grinnell lost, thePioneersplaycd very

Sticky Tongues compete in:
St Louis Ultimate Classic 1

By Stacey Gley

Last weekend the Sticky Tongues
traveled South to compete in the 10th
annual St. Louis Classic Ultimate
Frisbee Toumament. The allrfemalc
team was created two years ago by
co-captziins and seniors Nora Bloch
and Julie Kaster. In this, their second
and final tournament of the semester,
the Sticky Tongues played four
matches against club teams from
Kansas, Michigan, and the hosts, the
“Fizzbces”.

Tournament play is “definitely
importanttolhetearn,bccauseitgives
you experience in being exposed to a
more intense level ofplay than wearc
used toin pracuccand pick-ups,”said
first—year player Amy Neevel. She
felt the team “really started coming
together, experimenting. and trying
newthings"dun'ngSaturday’sgames.

CoachNyashaSpearssaid thatthc
“last point we made was the most

spectacular work that we have done
as a team this season. We really
worked the frisbee into the end-zone
andscoredagood,hard,honestpoint."
Spears felt diatthis toumamentwasa
successfulone for theStickyTongucs:
“As a team we were really working
togetherand really working the frisbee
down the field. Our passingskills and
our play as a team improved tremen-
dously throughout the day."

Kaster started and made many of
the important passes of the day along
with sophomore Gucn Gifford.

Seniors Gwenda McLamb and
HeidiBnkken ended lheircarecrs with
their best performances to date.
McLarnb wnsconsistcntly in position
for key throws during the games, re-
ceiving a scoring pass. Bakken was
an annoy in g fly to the web of Fizzbce
players when they attempted to play a
four-person cup zone defense.

Bloch remarked after the tournttr
mom that she may have “found her
position as long"during the games. In

the sprinting position, Bloch said that
she had gained a superior view of‘
team play and thcopportunity [OCOmr ‘
municate well to her teammates on g
the field. Bloch was the receiver for
the team's final point of the day, r
which Spears felt was “our finest,
moment as a team."

Switching with ease from long to ‘
short. jun|0f Portia Sabin “consis- ~
tently Sprinted hard throughout theg
game, making the cuts that were
needed,” said Spears. Spears felt that '
Ellen McCallic played 100% each ‘
time she took the field. Karen Warch
and Elizabeth Borg—Bowman also‘
played multiple positions where their i
fine cutting skills were displayed.

Despite an ankle injury, sopho-
more Carly Parry played each game. ~
Parry developed her skills in throw-A
ing the overhead hammer pass be»

nity to use it in the final game. -
