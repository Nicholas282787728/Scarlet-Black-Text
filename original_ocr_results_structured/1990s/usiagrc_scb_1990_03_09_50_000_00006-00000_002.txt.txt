Fernandez-McCarthy Offers
Ideas for Change

by Pedro FemandeercCarthy

Soon (Match 14, to be exact)
many of you will be voting in the
SGA elections. My name is Pedro
FemandeZ-McCarthy and I will be
running for the officeofPresident of
SGA.

This was not an easy decision for
me to make, for I am fully aware of
the commitrnentthat is necessary to
do a “good" job as President; for
example. the President must hold a
minimum of fourofﬁce hours aweek
(I promise to hold six hours during
the school week in addition to ofﬁcc
hours on Saturdays whenever fea-
sible). The Presidcnlzilsomust chair
the Joint Board and Cabinet meet-
ings every Wednesday and Sunday,
respectively. Also, the President
must deal with any concerns that
Senators orindividual students bring
up. Finally. the President must meet
regularly with various College ad-
ministrators. and with the Board of
Trustees whenever they meet at the
College.

However, the SGA Presidency is
not limitcdsimply tosuch prescribed
duties. A President must also be the
kind of person who is not afraid ci-
[her to point out inconsistencies to
the administration or to ensure that

Cabinet members are
performing their jobs
well.

I believe I have demr
onstratcd the degrce of
leadership necessary to
be President of SGA. For
examplc,thoughlamnot
an intemational student
(officially. anyway), I
drafted (at the request of
Anmew Sheehy, former
President of ISO) the
Joint Board Resolution
thatcalledforthcadmini-
stration to drop a policy
which would have disa
criminated, by means of
anautomaticdenialol'fi-
nancial aid. against in-
ternational students
wishin to study abroad.
Thc proposed policy
change was later
dropped,

I am also on the Harris Ccntcr
Committee Of course. this has
given me the opportunity to hire ll
say in how the Harris Center wtll
turn out, but more importantly. it
has given me thc opportunity to
workwithmostoflthollegc'stop
administrators, an undeniable illi-
vantagcshouldlbccotncPresidcnt.

Student Staff Background

by Scott Trucsdell

__—___
The position of SGA president
should be filled by an individual
who can effectively serve as a liai-
son between studcnts' concerns and
those of the faculty and administra-
tion. In order to be successful. a
president must be a skilled and ex—
perienced communicator, I
feeleossess Lhcsequalities.
The SGA president must ‘
be willing and able to dedi-
cate thenecessary amountof
time needed to successfully
fill the position, In the past
three semesters I have ,
doubled up theclasses in my '
major in order to complete
its requireman by the end
of this semester. Thus, with
my major completed. I will i
be able to commit myself
fully to the duties of SGA
president.
Last year I held the posir
tion of Student Advisor and
[am currently a Hall Activi- .
ties Coordinator. Because
the SGA consLitution pro-
hibits student staff members '
from participating in SGA
.e. Senator, Cabinet. etc).
my experience in this area
has been limited. Being a member
ofstudent staff. however, his given
me the experience of directly deal-
ing with student concerns. As it
result of this interaction I have ob-
tained first-hand knowlwgc of sut-
dcnts’ needs.

One benefit of thcse student staff
positions is that they require direct
interaction with the admtnrsLmIion.
In addition,lhaveguincd invaluable
experience by working With the ode

tations. I also have ample expert

Now that you havcwadcd through
my qualifications. I'd like to get to
the purpose of my statement of in;
rent: why I want to be SGA presi-
dent. Firstof all. over sincc my two
terms as class president in high
school I have. been interested in
studentgovcmmcnt. As SGA prcsi-
dent I would bc ablc to addres .
sues that have a definite impact on
student life. However. I um not
going to try to rLIlth offa listofiv
sucs that I promise to addres if
clectcd. I believe that tfonc goes
into the presidency with picconv
ccivcd ideas about what issucs
will come up a year from now. My
plan is to make SGA as effective
and as efficient as possible to deal
withstudcntconccrns. Idon’twant
to sound like I don't have a stand
on anything, though. There are
currentmattcrsihatncetltobcdcalt
with. such as deteriorating town-
gown relations. campus security,
and housing (new dorm. ovcrr
crowding, etc).

For me to be able to contribute
something to student life at Grinr
troll Collcgc would be u great
honor and a privilegc. I honestly
believe that I would make a very
good president. 1 have the time
and thc work ethic that the position
demands, and I will go the cxtra
