JERUSALEM. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
ruled out a state for Palestinians Thursday, on Israel‘s
50th binhday and ahead of Middle East peace talks
in London that increasingly looked doomed.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Whose country
was the ﬁrst Arab state to make peace with Israel,
urged Netanyahu to treat the Palestinians as partners
and accept a US. proposal on handing back more of
the occupied West Bank. U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright meets Netanyahu and Palestin~
ian President Yasser Arafat separately in London on

transfer of additional land to Palestinian selfrrule.

Albright Urges China Progress

BEIJING. The United States and China must “put a
shoulder to the wheel“ to reach agreements on trade
and non-proliferation in time for their June presiden-
tial summit, US, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said Thursday.

After two days of pre-summit preparation talks, she
told reporters that ofﬁcials have to move faster to
achieve results. Albright and top Chinese leaders went
toe-to-toe on major issues, including those on which
the two sides have serious differences such as Tibet
and religious freedoms, ofﬁcials said.

While no dramatic breakthroughs were announced,
both sides went out of their way to emphasize har-
mony.

More Russian Appointments

MOSCOW. President Boris Yeltsin reappointed a
handful of ministers and brought in a sprinkling of
new faces in a funher round of cabinet appointments
Thursday that made the new Russian government al-
most complete.

After Yeltsin met 35eyear-old Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko outside Moscow, the Kremlin announced
11 ministerial appointments. Nine posts had been
ﬁlled Tuesday, Oleg Sysuyev, 42, stays on as a deputy
prime minister, but this time one of just three as op»
posed to nine with that rank or higher in the govem-
ment dismissed by Yeltsin last month. More posts will
be ﬁlled when Yeltsin and Kiriyenko meet again Tues-
day.

Howard Files DiscriminationiComplaint ,

Former Assistant Coach Alleges Unfair Treatment based on Race

BY ERIN HUSTINGS
Editor-in-Chief

Former Grinnell College assistant footr
ball coach Todd Howard has ﬁled a come
plaint against the college with the Iowa
Civil Rights Commission and the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission.
The charge alleges discrimination based
on race, and retaliation against Howard
for protesting what be perceived to be
unfair treatment.

Howard's complaint is based largely
upon Grinnell’s failure to grant him face
ulty status and pay raises commensurate
with those received by employees with
similar duties. “I was recruited to work
here - I had never heard of Grinnell be-
fore I was contacted by the school,"
Howard commented. “I was enthusiastic
about the job, but because of the dispar-
ity in pay and status as compared to my
peers, and the degrading manner in which
I was treated, I came to feel that I was
simply here in a token position”

Howard emphasized that he had been
discussing his concerns with acting col-

lege presidentCharles Duke and Athletic
Director Dee Fairchild over the past two
years, but that the two had seemingly ex
pressed little concern overthe case. Ifhc
had received a legitimate explanation
from the administration, he said, he would
not have felt compelled to ﬁle a com-
pluint.

After preliminary investigation, the
Iowa Civil Rights Commission deemed

' the case worthy of further action. Howard

had a choice between arbitration and ﬁl-
ing suit against Grinnell. Howard says
he chose mediation, expecting a prompt
response from the school. Grinnell is re-
quired to agree to mediation for the case
to move forward, but so far, Howard com-
mented, a month has lapsed with no re-
sponse from the school.

According to Iowa Civil Rights Com~
mission employee Don Grove, mediation
is a stage through which almost all such
cases pass. “After a complaint is ﬁled
with us," Grove explained, “we investi-
gate it, asking for supporting documents
and testimonies from both parties in-
volved. If we decide that the case war—

Commission and the Equal Opportunity Commission.

rants further investigation, we then ask
both sides to consider mediation facili-
tated by our volunteer attorneys."

Ifthis mediation fails, the case is then
reviewed further and sent to an adminis-
trative law judge, who decides whether
or not there is probable cause to suspect
illegal discrimination. Ifthe judge rules
that there is probable cause, the agency

Grinnell remembers legendary Grant 0. Gale

BY SARAH RElNHARD
Staff Writer

Professor Emeritus of Physics Grant 0.
Gale left behind a legacy of kindness,

warmth, and years of successful teaching ‘

after he passed away.

Gale, 94, suffered from coronary anery
disease. He died on Tuesday, April 14 at
the Grinnell Regional Medical Center.

As memorial preparations come to frui-

. tion. co—workers and students reﬂect fondly

on the tremendous impact Gale made dur»
ing nearly 70 years of involvement with
Grinnell College.

“We’re not going to see anybody like
Grant around for a long time," said Phys-
ics Department Chair Bob Cadmus, who
worked with Gale for 20 years

Gale made impressive contributions to
the study of physics, receiving two
Fulbright fellowships and several research
contracts with the Ofﬁce of Naval Re-
search and the Research Corporation.

A graduate of the University of Wisconsin and the Univerr
sity ofMichigan, he was the ﬁrst to offer a class in Solid State

Electronics.

Gale also coordinated a Civil Pilots Training Program in

Grinnell during World War II.

However, the unique and special way he interacted-with stu-

dents brought him particular recognition.

"I think his important contribution was the character of his
relations with students," noted Cadmus. “He was magical."
Gale’s devotion to students spanned decades. He kept in close

throughout World War II.
“He had a real sincere interest in each of his students," said

Cadmus. “He seems to have really touched them.“

Though Gale retired from classroom teaching in 1972, he

maintained close and frequent involvement with Grinnell Cole

Examining Financial Aid

BY ERIN HUSTINGS
Editor—in-Chief

As college prices in the ‘905 typically
rise at about twice ’the general inflation
rate, ﬁnancial aid is an important issue
for large numbers of current and prospec-
tive college students. For many, aid of-
fers may decide where one attends school,
and even if one has access to higher edu-
cation. Financial aid, it seems, often plays
this critical role in the lives of
Grinnellians, 81% of whom receive some
forln of assistance. How is aid allotted at
Grinnell and at other schools? How do
students feel about Grinnell’s ﬁnancial as~
sistance programs?

HOW FINANCIAL
AID IS DETERMINED

Methods of calculating student aid
vary from school to school. Most schools
which offer substantial aid require stu-
dents to submit the Free Application for
Federal Student Aid, and other supple-
mental information on income and assets
including tax returns or the Financial Aid
Profile (formerly known as the FAF).
Based on this information, an expected
family contribution to schooling costs and
eligibility for government assistance are
determined. Government aid includes
Pell Grants and Federal Work Study.

According to the formula used by

governmental authorities to evaluate the
FAFSA, the Federal Methodology (FM),
students are expected to put 35% of as—
sets and 50% ofincome above $1750 to—
wards college fees. Parents supporting
their children are expected to contribute
5.64% oftheir income and assets below a
minimum living allowance threshold and
22% to 47% of income above this thresh-
old.

While some schools use the FM to
determine allocations ofinstitutional aid,
many use either their own formulae,
known as Institutional Methodologies
(IM), or a combination of FM and I'M.
There are sometimes important differ
ences between the two systems for calcur
lating ﬁnancial need. Circumstances and
assets not considered by the m may af-
fect IM-calculaled aid packages. One
example of these discrepancies often seen,
according to thc FinAid World Wide Web
page sponsored by the National Associa-
tion of Student Financial Aid Adminls-
trators, is the counting of home equity in
calculations. The Higher Education
Amendment of 1992 eliminated home
equity from FM estimations; however.
many schools, especially private schools,
continue to use this factor in their own
IMs.

Schools are under no obligation to
mcet the needs ofstudents and their fann-

ating and maintaining the Grinnell Physics Historical Museum.
“I often went over to his apartment in the afternoons to sit
and talk about the museum and life in general," said Stephany

lies with ﬁnancial aid packages. None»
theless, many schools pledge to use as
many of their resources as possible to pro
vide the monetary difference between the
price of school and the expected family
contribution to all students.

HOW GRINNELL

ALLOCATES FINANCIAL AID

At Grinnell, FM is used to award fed-
eral assistance. and an I'M is utilized to
determine eligibility for school grants,
loans, and some scholarships. With ample
ﬁnancial resources, Grinnell is able to
maintain a need-blind ﬁnancial aid policy,
which means that “we meet all demon~
stratcd instituLional student need," accord
ing to Director of Financial Aid Arnold
Woods.

Grinnell has historically been come
pared favorably to its peer institutions.
“Institutions award ﬁnancial aid differ-
ently based on their institutional ability
to meet student needs, commented
Woods. “The best form of assistance pos-
sible is the need-blind philosophy that we
use here." For those students who qualify
for need~based grants, U.S. News and
World Report estimates the average cost
szl year at Grinnell after ﬁnancial aid in
1996-97 at $11, 691, down from that
year's comprehensive fee of $22,720
This discount, as well as the fact that the

In the event that this effort fails as well,
the case is then granted an ofﬁcial hear-

Howard’s charges He did, however. ex-
plain that Grinnell “remains committed

‘Seeing Black,
Selling Fear’

Minority Scholar in
Residence to Explore
Race in Advertising

BY YASUKO TAOKA
Staff Writer

Andre Alexis Robinson, a doctoral
candidate from Duke University, will be
one of three Minority Scholars in Resi-
dence next year. Robinson will teach a
short course entitled “Seeing Black, Sell-
ing Fear: Race and Political Advertis-
ing.”

The course will focus on racially mo-
tivated advertising in recent political
campaigns. The three week course will
emphasize the ethical choices made by
campaigns in the face of a multiracial
electorate. Robert Grey, professor of PG
litical Science, commented, “[It will be]
a very provncative and interesting
course."

MSIR is bringing Robinson to carn-
pus in coordination with the Political
Science department. Grey cited
Robinson‘s excellent credentials and in-
novation as highlights of his qualiﬁca-
tions. .

Robinson is a doctoral candidate at
Duke University’s graduate program in
Political Science, concentrating in P0-
litical Communication / Media Effects,
Robinson‘s dissertation topic is “Out of
the Shadows of the Capitol: The Media
and the Congressional Black Caucus."

Among Robinson’s accomplishments
is the cofounding of a documentary pro-
duction company, “Gone South Produc-
tions." Gone South produces ﬁlms for
use in secondary and higher education,
and focuses on issues of race and poli-
tics. Grey was particularly impressed by
Robinson’s many talents: “He really
brings an unusual mix to us with the aca-
demics and the ﬁlmmaking."

V MSle are required to present a lec-

lure to the public during their stay in
Grinnell. Grey hoped that Robinson‘s
film, and an accompanying lecture,
would be the subject of Robinson’s pre-
sentation.

Robinson is also distinguished in the
ﬁeld of Comparative Politics, emphasiz-
in g I apan and Latin America. In relation,
Robinson has experience teaching En-
glish in Japan and Spain.

Robinson will not be the ﬁrst MSIR
from Duke’s graduate school. In 1993
Katya Gibel Azoulay taught at Grinnell
as part of the program. Gibel Azoulay is
now a professor of Anthropology.

The purpose of the Minority Schol-
ars in Residence Program is to bring ex-
perts to campus to teach a two to three
week course. The goal of this program
is to diversify Grinnell faculty and our-
riculum. Past Scholarsrin-Residence in-
clude Bobby Sanafria and LeAnne
Howe.
