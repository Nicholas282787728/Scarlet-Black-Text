Women shatter track records, place well at Luther
Tracksters hit stride for major meets as school relay records are set

Sports Information

With the Central Invitational
looming ahead this Saturday and the
Grinnell/DeLong Classic the follow-
ing weekend, the Grinnell College
women’s track season is hitting full
stride. Central's meet is the Iowa
College Championships and the In-
vitational on April 19 is one of the
largest meets in the midwest. “I-Iope»
fully, we can stay healthy and con»
tinue to improve,“ said Coach Evelyn
Freeman.

Despite the wonderful weather
last week during training, Saturday’s
meet at Luther had to be completed
indoors. Luther was the clear win»
ner with 172 points. Wartburg ﬁn»
ished second ahead of U.W.-Slevens
Point, 82—675. Although there were
10 events in which the Pioneers had

no one entered, Grinnell managed to
place sixth out of 14 teams. “Our
focus was on the relays, so I am ex-
tremely pleased with a point total of
50.5," noted Freeman,

Grinnell claimed victories in two
of the seven relays. The 4 x 800 quar-
tet of Becca Webel ‘98, Sara
Boudoutls ‘97,.lulianna Scrafini ‘00
and Steph Walters ‘97 blazed to a
school record time of 9:45 (20 sec-
onds better than the previous mark).
Also, Skye Langs ‘00, Fran Lee ‘00,
Amanda Walker ‘98 and Marta
Fisher ‘97 shattered the 1990 dis-
tance medley record.

“Amazingly, they ran the new
record of 12:54 indoors!" exclaimed
Freeman. The time will count as an
indoor record only, but the group will
have a chance in two weeks to do it
outdoors: In the sprint medley the

same tracksters ran a solid 4:36 to
place fourth.

For the first lime in Grinnell his
tory Zl woman competed in the pole
Vault, Jo Shaalman ‘99 cleared three
heights and placed fourth with a vault
of 6‘ 10", “Each time she cleared
the bar she set a new school record,"
beamed Freeman. In the high jump
Meredith Ing’s ‘97 PR leap of 4' 11"
was good for a fifth-place tie. Also,
Razel Mueller ‘97 placed ﬁfth in the
10k in a PR time of39252 and Fisher
was third in the Skin 9215. “With
this week‘s meet in Pella and after
last week’s arduous trip to Decorah,
we are glad to be competing closer
to home,“ concluded Freeman.

With the experience of the first
outdoor meet under their belts, the
Grinnell College trackmen look
ahead to this weekend’s Central In»

vitational. According to Coach Will
Freeman, the team will focus prima-
rily on indiVidual events.

Despiteinclement weather condi-
tions and the absence oftwo top run-
nets, the Pioneers put forth a strong
effort at the Luther Invitational last
weekend. The team finished 131h in
the overall team standings, but posted
some notable ﬁnishes. In contrast to
next week’s meet, the focus at Luther
was on relays, and Coach Freeman
was particularly impressed with the
performance of the 4 x 800 team
which placed fourth overall.

“That group was running without
our top 800M runner, Brian Rebar
‘97, and they still ﬁnished within one
second of our school record. It will
be exciting to watch them in action
once Rebar is healthy," Freeman ex»
plained.

Freeman was also pleased with the
performances ofMark Schliekelman
and Matt Rhoads ‘99 who finished
third and eighth respectively in the
400M hurdles. In the ﬁeld events
Thad Lcsiak ‘97 turned in a respectr
able fourth-place finish with a dis
cus throw of 38.90.

“Luther was a good introduction
to the outdoor season for us. We‘ll
switch gears this week and look to
the Central meet as a stepping stone
to the conference meet Keep an eye
on Schliekelman in the hurdle events
and Jeff Root ‘97 in the pole vault.
He’s been vaulting real well in prac—
tice and I think he just needs some
good weather to go to the next level,
“Coach Freeman said, With the re
turn of Rebar and top distance rune
ner Dan Madigan, the team’s outlook
is good.

 

 

Pioneers savor stellar performance
through rain delays

Sports Information

Bad-weather postponements have -
been frustrating for the Grinnell Col—
lege baseball team but the situation
has given Coach Tim Hollibaugh and
his players ample time to savor one
of the classic pitching performances
in Pioneer history.

Rob Martin, junior right—handler
from Talihina, Okla., shut out
Cornell, 1-0, here IastTuesday in the
Midwest Conference opener, allow
ing only three hits and no walks.
Martin faced only 22 batters. He
picked one runner off base and teams
mates turned a double play as part
of their errorless support.

Grinnell’s run came in the sixth

inning on a single by Mike Munoz
‘99, a sacriﬁCE'by Martin, an inﬁeld
out, and Jason Zeeh‘s ‘98 grounde
rule double that bounced over the
fence.

“It was a super effort by Rob Mar-
tin as well as the defense behind him.
No question, it was by far the best
performance by the team since I‘ve
been here. Hopefully we'll see more
in the future,” Coach Hollibaugh
commented.

The second game of the double-
header was a different story as ﬁve
Grinnell pitchers marched to the
mound and several had control
trouble ina 1478 Cornell victory. The

Pioneers outhit the visitors, nine to
eight, but committed three errors.

“We kept battling all the way and
scored four runs in the seventh, We
are starting to make strides with how
the team is playing the game. That is
important to the future of Pioneer
baseball," the coach added.

Grinnell's top hitters for the day
were Munoz and Zeeh with four hits
each. Munoz is on a sevenvgame hit-
ting streak.

This Saturday the Pioneers are
scheduled for a doubleheader at
Monmouth, a perennial contender in
the conference south division. The
Scots are off to a 20 start.

The past weekend held mixed for-
tunes for the Grinnell College men's
golf team. On one hand, the Pioneers
were forced to play in the inclement
weather, marked by cold wind, sleet
and snow. These lessthan-ideal con-
ditions gave the Pioneers ﬁts, driv-
ing their scores up to inordinately
high levels.

On the other hand, the squad

rounded out the field, stroking 90

“But all the other teams were in the

the course and play golf. We did
that to some extent this weekend,
but we need to really turn it up a

Twelve strokes is a really subsrane

Tennis team crushes

Cornell 7 -0

Sports Information}

The Grinnell College men‘s ten-
nis team will take part this weekend
in a tournament hosted by Central
College. Eight teams will face offin
one of the season’s most important
meets in which singles will be played
Saturday. followed by doubles action
on Sunday. The most anticipated
match»ups for Grinnell are Central,
Knox and Nebraska Wesleyan. Last
year Grinnell lost to Knox by one
point and edged out Nebraska
Wesleyan by the same margin.

Grinnell will be playing without
senior singles player Josh Tepfer.
Coach Andy Hamilton admits that
the absence of Tepfer changes the
outlook, but remains confident. “I’m
looking for us to come out and com-
pete," said Hamilton. “For some of
our players, it will be their ﬁrst time
playing against this kind of compe-
tition, Others will have to move up
a spot. Needless to say, things should

be very competitive and very reward-
ing." '
In last week's play the team split
its two matches, losing to Lake Forv
est, 4—3, and beating Cornell for the
second time this season, 770. On
April Fool's Day. Gi‘innell's perfor-
mance was no joke. After a slow start
in doubles, all matches were won in
straight sets, including those by
Jaemin Kim ‘98 and Nate
Knoemschild ‘00, No. 5 and 6, who
have not seen much match play this
season. Hamilton expressed the feel-
ing ofthe entire team that the Cornell
players are some of the best sports-
men in the conference, exemplifying
good onrcoui‘t behavior and courtesy.
The loss to Lake Forest was an—
other disappointing example of a
close match that should not have gote
ten away, but did. It has become ape

parent to Hamilton, after losing to ,

Coe and now Lake Forest by one
point, that more attention needs to be
paid to the doubles point. “The

doubles point is more important
than most people realize.“ said
Hamilton. “It will certainly be the
emphasis for us as we look for ways
to improve."

In play against Lake Forest the
Pioneers turned in some impressive
performances, including clutch efr
forts by Tepfer, 76 (8-6), 6-1 and
Aaron Wagner ‘99, 6-0, 4-6, 7-5.
Thcmios Carabas ‘97 remained
steady for Grinnell, 64, 6-1. De-
spite these performances, the team
was not playing its best tennis.
Also, Lake Forest surprised
Hamilton, who compliments them
for adding strength to their lineup
since last year.

Hamilton said, “After facing
strong opponents like Lake Forest
and looking down the road at Ripon,
Knox and Coe, we'll have to im-
prove to remain competitive in the
conference. With three seniors and
good underclass talent, I think we’ll
be able to make that improvement."

Softball team off to solid start

Sports Information

Off to a successful start in the
Midwest Conference last Saturday,
the Grinnell College softball team
looks forward to their conference
home games this week. Saturday
