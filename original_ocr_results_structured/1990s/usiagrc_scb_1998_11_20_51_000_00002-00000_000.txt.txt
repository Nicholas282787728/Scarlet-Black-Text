(GAAC), is shown with elementary school art teachers whose pro-
gramming will be enhanced by nearly $1500 worth of new equip-
ment made possible through GAAC's ﬁnancial support. Bailey Park's

affectionately knowas”Fred,"Davis musicteacherBarbVan Ersvelde‘s
program received a new turntable to teach music appreciation, and
Duane Murray, who teaches art at all three elementary schools, is
pictured with masks ﬁred in Davis School's new kiln. The addition of
the Davis kiln c carfunded by the Council and the school system —
makes the opportunity to ﬁre clay creations a permanent part ofthe
arts curriculum at all three Grinnell elementary schools. Worley ex—
plains that the Council worked with teachers to identify school ans
program needs which are not normally covered by the school bud-
get. Murray, who is a member ofthe Council, expressed appreciation
to those who donate to the Council and thus support the diverse
portfolio of arts initiatives which it provides the community.
