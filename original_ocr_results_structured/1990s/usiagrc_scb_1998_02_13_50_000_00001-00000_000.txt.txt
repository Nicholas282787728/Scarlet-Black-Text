“Russia has never made any deals with Iraq that
would violate international sanctions, moreover
deals involving supplies of banned technologies.”

Indepeiidcni consultants. hired by
Grinnell College, recently r'clcascd their
study of the coltegc‘s retention mics and
admisston policies. The study also ad-
dressed campus and national perceptions
ofGrinncll Ititcrim President ofthe Col-
lege Charles Dukc stated that the purpose
of the study was "to find out more about
ourselves."

Jan Krukowski and Company issued
the study in Jaliruuty 199s, analyzrng a
survey ofGtinnclI College conducted by
Kane, Parsons, and Associates, Inc. last
year.

Although the study found that rctcn-
tion rates were riot a problcrii, it noted that
multicultural retention was low Also, iso
lation, location, cost, and curriculum were
noted as factors iii the withdrawal of stu-
dents in general

The study reported a retention rate of
82%, 92% of withdiawlils transferring to
another institution.

The Krukowskt study concluded that
in order to raise its retention rate, Grin-
ncll College lnust “expand its applicant
pool" so ' to ltdmit students who have a
better "fit" with the College. The report
suggested that the College should revise
its admissions litcrlituic to better reflect
itself.

The snmc sentiment is cchocd by slur

rized Carlos Eduardo Macias ‘99. Pointr

multicultural students is approximately
60%, Macias said: “It is more the

continued, The ambiance of the college

Jo Calhoun, Director of Academic
Advising also commented that
multicultural students may have a diffi-
cult time with isolation, According to
Calhoun, nuiny students may have to go
through the lilinsillon of being front a
community rich in multiculturalism to

New Dining Option Announced

BY MOLLY GARDNER

Dining Services has announced it plan
to open two convenience outlets. dubbed
The Northern Express mid The Southern
Express. to augment the current board
plan.

According to Director of Dining Scr-
viccs Dave McConnell the outlets are in-
tctidcd to distribute food at times more
convenient than regular dining Iilttt liou '
“Onc oftlic responses from the Survey nc

ever, students may only visit once per

Missed meals were u minor driving
force behind the new adaptations, Curr

ﬁrst of a three part series

rciitly, most students on tho board plan
are allowed n set number of meals per
week: lnlsscd meals lrotn one week can-
not bc made up the t‘oltowtng week.
Whilc planning the budget, Dining Ser—
vi cs relies on a certain percentage of
missed meals.

However, thcsc circumstances leave
litany students dissatisfied. As Jessica
l-lcnrd ‘0] said. “Today I slept through
lunch. Although that doesn’t happen of-
tcn, I do get frustrated. because then I
tend to get hungry later in the evenings."

Whtlc llte adapted system attempts io
assuage such frustration, a possible rise
in meat participation raises concerns that
the price of the board plan will also rise.

However, McConnell stressed that
any changes in board price would not
show up for at least another year because

"TllIS is a work in progress,"
McConnell asserted ‘ rid We will use
this spring to got some experience and

bust we can to stay \\lll’lln the budget.”

Aside from potential rise in boaid plan
costs, another concern rniscd was
whether the outlets would draw business
away from Bob‘s Undciground. Asked
whether he wt ' concerned. Bob‘s co»
manager Nicholas Rain: ‘00 responded.
