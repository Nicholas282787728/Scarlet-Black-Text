lThe Jesus Lizard The Jesus Lizard“My wheelchair," David Yow blarcs intermittently throughout “Cold Water," the title track on the Jesus Lizard‘s latest self-entitled EP. With those
two words, Yow reinvokes memories of "Wheelchair Epidemic,” while the crunching guitar and bouying bass combine to produce the same effect. With this initial track, the Lizard appear to
be rescucitating their gritty indie roots. After their ﬁrst highlyrcriticized album Shot, the new EP is redeeming, to say the least. Not only does the album unearth the Lizard’s roots with the
tracks “Cold Water" and “Eyesore (the echoing vocals and biting power chords hring Liar to mind)," it also manages to delve into a daring, winding experimentation towards the end of the EP.
With the help of lunatic Jim O’Roarke‘s (cf. Brainiac Elecltv-Sliockfor President for details) and sampling-happy Andy Gill, the Lizard pull out one of the most awkward, unexpected songs
from their bag ol’tricks. “Needles for Teeth" concludes the album with peculiar poppings, gargles and squeaks. On the other hand, the Lizard's latestEP shares a quizzical resemblance to the
Lizard‘s ﬁrst product. Remember Pure, released back in 19897 The band started their career with this ﬁve-song EP, arguably the Lizard’s most experimental album. With a drum kit and a
wailing, raw guitar sound, Head matches the new EP in a spooky way, Both albums embark with title-track hard-rock songs, but then drift into vocal»less, eerie tunes. If this is so, have the
Lizard truly evolved, then? Sure. But it’s come as a result of the band making the move to more expensive recording. Compare “Valentine,” a dreary, elongated bass solo that marks as the
album's turning point, with ”The Associate," one of the slower tracks offthe band's 1994 Down release. Both songs share roughly the same length. somber mood, and crescendoing agony. At
the same time, though, try turning up the volume knob at the beginning of“Valentine" and listen carefully — you'll find that the hidden noises and added synchronism of mutliple samples
provides a much rounder, complete sound. It's interesting because out of all the Lizard albums, the one they produced offa major label sounds the worst. That‘s exactly why their latest EPis
so refrcshing nnd convincing. As the album is offletset Records, a young, small label, the Lizard backtrack to indiehood with grace. Just like in ihetrearly years, the Lizard manage to capture
their perfectionist grit~pop with their other experimental, freerform side. Best of all, they achieve their task in a mere ﬁve songs-K0 2Trans Am The SurveillanceTrans Am’s latest
release The Surveillance equips Thrill Jockey, one of indie rock’s most up-and-coming labels, with yet another gem. The label, which has given birth to Tortoise among other soon—terbeV
legends, has now printed three magnificentTrans Am albums, Trans Am has lead an inquisitive existence thus far. Their debut self-entitled album boasted instrumental. bass-driven rock tracks
that buried wanna-be surf rock instrumentalists a good three or four feet under. But then, with Surrender Io Ihe Night, the band managed to surprise once again. This time, 'f‘rans Am
incorporated more electric sounds and sampling beats, as opposed to rock riffs. The Surveillance is a perfect medium between the two, and arguably surpasses both previous albums for that
very reason. The album starts offwith a riprroziring, echoey bass and guitar track, but what follows is a borderlinertechno beat time. For the ﬁrst six songs on the album, the band toggles with
those two elements: rapid rock, ilten beatrladcn samplings Upon seeing the band live, it becomes plainly obvious that this most recent album is the most appropriate one the band has produced
thus far. With a drummer and bassist, the third member of the band alternates between guitar and a sound machine throughout the show. However, even if the two styles of playing the band
experiment with seem somewhat unrelated, the band's sharp, slanted attitude bond the two sounds together. The result: a shaped, varied product that serves as an ideal album. Using the two
types ot'sound, the band can stlirt and close its albums with rock anthems, giving the listenera definite sense ofonset and finality. Still. the band uses their more beat-oriented tunes throughout
the middle of the album to carry the listener through, whilc periodically messing with his sanity. “E.S,I." features thirty seconds of a submarine radar pulse, while “Access Control" conCIUdes
with a radiorfuzz crescendo. Rektiown for its simple but dead-center effects, the band parades its artistry with sampling effects that fit into the Trans Am sound more accurately than ever. in
other words, this most recent album can be perceived as the milestone in the band's career thus far. Not for one minute does the album falter or lose sight of its mission: to ”thrill" the listener
with beats, effects, and riffs that keep him intrigued, soothed, and riled.»KO 3The DirtbombSAll Geeked Up (7") Mick Collins. the king of trash and soul, is back again with some dirt
to stain your shirt. The Dirtbombs have endured many line up changes over the last two years, but remain adamant about keeping one thing intaetrthe rhythm section Two drummers, two
hassists. What results is the usual cacophony you might expect from these garage rockers, only magniﬁed 100 times. This is loud. The ﬁrst song, “Don’t bogue my high, is a classic two chord
romp that gets things otho a familiar start. Yet from there on, the Dirtbombs do a strange, SOs—ish scivﬁ song (“lnfared”) and then ﬁnish up on the B side with two show stopping soul shakers
(including a wonderful cover of the Sorrows' “I'll Be in Trouble"). They will be releasing a full length later this year, and although your guess is as good as mine about what style it will be,
we can be sure it will kick ass-MR 4The King Sound Quartet The Getdown Imperative What do you get when two or the best bands in garage rock get together (The Lord High
Fixers and Blacktop)? The Gzrzlmwt Imperative is great, but not what we all might have wanted. The foursome got together with the understanding that they would be a soul cover band, doing
li fcw originals here and there. After playing for a day they soon realized they were coming back to familiar territory. “1 Wouldn't Put it Fast You," the album's opening track, is only
disappointing in that It doesn't stray‘too far from a typical Lord High Fixers song. But don’t get me wrong—it’s incredible. The standrout on this record is their cover of Ray Charles' “I Want
To " Mick Collins (vocals, guitar, harmonica) really unleashes his tender soul on this one; I bet iteould make any leatherjacketwcaringbadassrocker get misty. Side Bis only one song, acover
of Sun Ra's “Space is the place." I have to admit, i never ever listened to the whole thing... but i doubt if the band cares. While it really isn't listenable, it is neat to see people branching out
from the usual three chords. Even ifThe Kind Sound Quartet isn't a true soul band, they are still it reassuring example of what soul and swing is left in the rock and roll world right now—MR

5Pussy Galore Live: In the Red For those thatdon't know, Pussy Galore was Jon Spencer‘s main thing before the Blues Explosion. Way before the Blues Explosion. We’re talking long
hair and leather boots. They don't sound too far removed from the Blues Explosion though, ifyou just cut out Jon's bullshit interjections and some of Russell Simins' funky drummer beats.
This live album is from the last Show they ever played, January 29,1989 at CBGBS. Their set is primarily made up of later material, like “Sweet little hi fi, " “Understand Me," and “Dick
Johnson." All in all this record avaids the trappings of most whack ass live albums» (A) They don‘ tscrew around between songs Luckily, things are so noisy that taking time to tune isn t that
necessary (B) Jon Spencer mixed the album in August of last year, making sure it conveys the raw rawk sound that is missing when many bands put a show on record This lsa good way to
get the Pussy Galore 1998 party started right. Matador is re releastng Dial “M"for motherfucker, SitgarS/ti! Shall), and Righl Now! this March, which should be on everyone 5 shopping list
ifyou've hettrd this live album. ltnnytiting, you can hear the songs when their guitars are in tune. Well, I doubt iflhat's even true. If you like the Blues Explosion, go get this and ﬁnd out what
the demented rock and roll mind of Jon Spencer thought ten years ago-MR
