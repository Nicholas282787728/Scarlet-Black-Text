drug addiction, domestic violence,
and broken homes. The stress of
poverty, the feelings of disempower—
ment and worthlessness, not to men»
tion the empty belly, is universal. To
reverse the causality and blame the
poor for their situation is an interest:
ing and antiseptic intellectual exer-
cise for the walthy and self—satisﬁed.
And it may evenallow the plutocrats
to continue their profitrfocused lives
by pitting the masses against one
another while they cut wages and
slash social programs (which forces
the poor into slayewagc yobs),

Antlrwelfare, anthmlgrnnt,
population nightmare, jingolsric di-
atribes about “safe for democracy,“ it
all distills to the true purpose of the
global “elites”: to decrease produc—
tion prices and increase profits. No
other western nation has our crime
rate because no othei-western nation
has so vitiated their social safety net.
In Western Europe, government tax«
es were an average of 46%. In the
United States, they were 32%. Thus,
“US social welfare policies look pos-
itive ly medieval compared to Europe,
Canada, and many other countries"
(Sklar). Of course, the prison indus—
try is now its own big business with a
large lobby. Prison has now become
both a welfare program (lock up the
poor) and a jobs program.

31’0le FOR THE RICH

Our government pursues amon—
etary policy which pandets to the
rich andintentiorially keepsmillions
of Americans unemployed and un-
deremployed. Every time unem—
ployment falls “too low," the Federal
Reserve raises interest rates to slow
down the economy. Life is easier for

corporations if there are people
scrounging for any yob they can get.
it is worth noting that Congress and
the president also cut $41.5 billion
from the Earned Income Tax Credit
(EITC), thus essentially raising tax»
es on the poorestworkets by over$40
billion and making life tougher yet
for the working poor.

While the safety net vanishes,
prisons ﬂourish, and unemployment
is policy, the rich are also hard at
work directly lining their pockets
ivrth government money. Programs
which can be strictly defined as con
porare welfare cost $125 billion ev—
ery year. Tax breaks for rich individ—
uals cost roughly $90.1 billion every
year, The war budget, all told, was
$414 billion last year, ivhich is large4
ly a subsidy to rich companies (war
industry is capital intensive. with a
low multiplier; as a jobs program, it is
inadequate). Taxes on corporations
have fallensince the 19605 fromabout
4% to 2% of GDP (Gross Domestic
Product). “If corporate taxes were
returned to the 4% ofGDP level this
would yield $100 billion a year; if it
were pushed up to thcjapanese level
(7.5%) it would produce $280 bilr
lion, enough to Wipe out the deficit
by itself" (Herman). Occasionally,
we hear posturing about removing
subsidies or clcaning up defense cor.
niption. But the rhetoric quiets, and
nothing (inevitably) gets done.
Meanwhile, according to Wolff.
AFDC beneﬁts are down 30 percent
in real terms since lhe 1970s, to iusr
16.9 billion dollars in 1994.

ment subscribes to a pacifist annrr

there are no byrlaws,nosign—upforms,
nothing to stop anyone who feels

Catholic Workers I‘ve been to have
some basic ideological similarities.

the border, capital is allowed to flow
more freely This is a perversion of
AdamSmith, who assumed that cap-
ital would be relatively immobile in
the short run and labor would be
mobile. Of course, it jibes perfectly
with corporate intEIBB, as they take
advantage of low-wage jobs and non—
existent environrnental and labor
standards to pressure their US Em»
ployees to take wage cuts andlayoffs.
The effect of NAFTA is devastating
to the people of Mexico and the
United States. But it is great for
corporations, which is why theyspent
over 300 million dollars (to 30 mil—
lion against) to see it passed, and this
is beyond the free publicity of literal-
ly hundreds of pro-NAFTA articles
in every major paper in the weeks
leading up to the Congressionalvote.
Business is booming, and now Clin-
ton plans to extend NAFTA to the
Southernmost tip of South America,

5.BLAM1'NG THE VICTIMS

To add insult to all this injury,
we find Clinton, Congress, and their
opulent cronies, the people who are
sending the poor deeper into pover—
ry,wagingarhetoricalbaltletoblame
the victims for their Situation. Phil
Gramm captures the temper inWash—
ington when he calls on the women
and children who receive AFDC to
get out of the wagon which is our
economy and help pull. It is up to
none other than voice—ofrtheqight
George Will to point out that if we
booked up all the AFDC beneficia—
ties to we harnesses, we wouldn’t
move too much more quickly. Polit—
ical discourse in this country has tak—

significant jail time for opposition
to war preparation, The man who
founded the Des Moines house has
spent over 2 1/2 years incarcerated
for walking onto the property of the
Strategic Command Air Force Base
in Omaha.

Many Catholic Workers also
embrace the movement for ecolog—
ical sustainability. There arc a half
dozen Catholic Worker farms, in»
cluding one or [he more successful
ones in Maloy, Iowa. These farms
tend to offer an alternative to mod—
crn urbanization. The idea is to
move to the land and live as free as
possible from exploitation accord»
ing to the Oandhian idea of“brcad
labor."

is Capitol Hill's guiding welfare pol—
icy principle. Far from recognizing
Jesus in “the least of these,”Clinton
and Congress play Herod and wish
death and despair upon the least of
our citizens,

"No one should doubt that end—
ing welfare will lead to more hunger,
homelessness, crime, illness, and, as
batteredwomen‘s advocates arewarn<
ing, the beating and murder of wom—
en and children less able to ﬂee their
abusers“ (Sklai). 1 mean seriously,
“impoverished women don‘t create
poverty any more than slaves crested
slavery" (Sklar). “Scapegoating en«
courages people to think of ‘the poor'
as the ‘other America,’ Them and
not Us." This. in turn, allows Con-

gress andClinton to totally mke away
any security for the most vulnerable
people in our society as we, the sec»
tors which are doing fine, thank you,
look the other way.

SEEKING SOLUTIONS

There simply aren‘t enough de»
cent jobs. Corporations are restruc—
turing, killing unions, movingsouth
of the border (or to Asia), hiring
more temporary workers, slashing
benefits, etc. Thus, profits soar while
wages and employment both fall.
Basically and clearly, the system has
failed; capitalism does not work.
Capitalism relies on the profit mo-
tive and individual choice. Well,
the profit motive causes gross ex—
ploitation and iniquity; and individ—
ual choice is a dream of “ideal mar—
kets" which do not exist.

Everyone, just for being alive,
has a right to shelter and sustenance.
This is a principle of the Universal
Declaration on Human Rights. Ba—
sic human rights—to food, health
care, clean water, a decent educa—
tion, a safe and satisfying job—ore
absolutely requisite for a society of
self»tespecting human beings. We
have aneconomy which could easily
provide basic human rights, but at
the expense ofptoﬁts for the rich; so
Clinton and congress choose to per—
petuate and exacerbate poverty in
this country. It is interesting that
when the UN adopted the Intema—
tional Convention on the Rights of
the Child,onlytheUnitedStatesdid
not endorse it (168—1). When the
UN passed a resolution to condemn
Nestle’s for their egregious policies
in third world countries, only the US
dissented (118»1).

Some key questions should
present themselves to us. For exam-
ple-.Why meiWhat is required ofrne
as a result of my privilege,] If we find
ourselves pleading that “I worked
hard to get where I am!,” then we are
trulylivrng ivithblinders on. People
who are living in the impoverished
sectors are NOT there because they
are lazy or worthless human beings.
They are there, generally, because
society is unwilling to take personal
responsibility for its less fortunate
sectors.

“It is time tosttip away the cam-
ouﬂage ofscapegoating from upward

Every one of us at Grimell is
responsible. It is up to allof us to take
a stand on the side ofjustice. And it
is up to all of us to take a stand
immediately: Povert Action Now!
