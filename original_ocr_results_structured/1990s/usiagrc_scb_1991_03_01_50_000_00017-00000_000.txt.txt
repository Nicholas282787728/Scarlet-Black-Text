Passion unfolds in
A Room with a View

By Lisa Ranahan

A Room with a View is a whim»
sical social comedy faithfully
adapted for the screen from the
novel by E. M. Forster. The movie,
winner of the Best Film Award in
1986, stars Helena Eonharn Caner
as Lucy Honcychurcli, a muddled
young English woman who goes to

Florence on vacation with her
spinsler cousin Charlotte (Maggie
Smith). In Florence she meets the
silent, moody George Emerson

expressing her passion for him and
stilling it.

Once in England, the plot takes
a romantic and pleasantly farcical
twist that.

The movie would excite any
audience with its brilliant animur

trayod by the characters, Any critic
can only empathize with Eric and
Ariel throughout their struggles in
a mere hope that truth, justice, and
love will reign. I personally think
that Sebastian the crab is enough
reason to convince anyone to go to
the Harris Cinema either tonight at
7:30 or on Sunday at 3 pm. and
enjoy this timeless classic. I guarr
