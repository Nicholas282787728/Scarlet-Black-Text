Alrighr. I know I’ll sound weird

abour sporrs, And, more rhan mosr

le’s all abour oprions. Living in
sourhern California (orange
Counry), n was casyialmost naro—
ralito sray informed abour music,
because rhe oprions and avenues ro
explore music were endless. on rhe
radio, rock, hip hop, mdie, and eve
eryrhing in between could be found
in abundance. The LA mics kepr
rabs on music on a naeional level,
while rhc free newsmags, [A Wee/sir
and OCWeeIrIy, did Lhcsarnc on she
1le level. Record srores srocked
more Ll-lan iusr rhe Top 20 CD's and
die old srandbys. Finally, live music
could, be cnjoycd in all forms, from
small venues ro gianr sradiums. In
orher words, rhere was a music
“scene."

Then rhere's Glinncll, where she
oprions for musical exploration are
decidedly fewer. No offense ro
