Plans for new
dorm on track
for next year

By Sharyn Obsatz

Construction could begin as
early as next fall fora new dormi»
toryl The preliminary plans have
been approved,with somechanges,
by the New Residence Hall Com-
mittee and will be presented to tile
trustees on Feb. 2lst.

The current overcrowding prob-
lem in the dorms, the future re-
moval of three campus-owned
houses south of 6th. Ave, on Park
St,,arld efforts to decrease thenumr
ber of students living in non-coir
lege owned, sub—standard housing
have all necessitated the new dor-
mitory.

“The building of a new dorm
will not increase enrollment on
campus,"stressed'l'om Crady,Dean
of Student Affairs

The dorm, designed by Herbert
Stone. who also designed the Bar»
n's Center, will house 96 students.
Its preliminary ﬂoor-plan includes
singles, doubles, and four-room
u‘iples. There will also be 3 RA.
apartment on the ﬁrst ﬂoor.

Duetoﬁre regulations,only three
levels in the new dorm can be used
for students housing. Thebasement
level will contain an aerobics room
and a mid-sized study room with
corrals.

A two‘story lounge will be lo-
cated on the ﬁrst floor, complete
with skylights and a fireplaces on
each level.

The dorm will be “Y"—shaped.
and constructedina style similar to
that of the existing South Campus
dorms,

"Itdeﬁnitely willfitin perfectly.
It was a major concern of the com-
mittee not to create another Nonis.

We wantsomething we canbeproud
of,” said Doug Murphy, a student
member of the committee,

Located westofLooseand Read
halls, the dorm will be connected
by an open-air walkaway to the
South Campus loggia.

Several locations for the dorm
were carefully considered Ac-
cording to the preliminary building
plans, space requirements at the
current South Campus site might
necessitate the removal of willow
tree outside Loose.

“We looked at it Closely. Unfor-
tunalely, there was no way to avoid
cutting thewillow down. The South
campus location was so far supe~
n'or,” said Murphy.

“South Campus was originally
designed as a quadrangle, and the
new dorm will serve as the third leg
of the quadrangle. It works well,
both architecturally and aesthetir
cally,” said Waldo Walker, Grin-
nell College’s Executive Vice
President.

Other locations considered were
thearea behind Younkerl-lall, which
would haverequired the removal of
last year's “Brown House", and the
ﬁeld behind the health center, which
the committee felt would be too
“setoff' from the rest of campus

The commillec was reluctant to
build the new don-n on North cam~
pus due to the already uneven dis
tribution of sludeanbetween North
and South campus which causes
problems at Cowles Dining Hall.

Once actual construction begins,
it should only a year for the build-
ingtobecompleted,atacostof2.5-
3.5 million dollars. If all goes ac-
cording to schedule, the new dorm
may be ﬁnished in Fall, 1992.

The proposed layout of the new dorm on South Campus The plan, which will be re-
viewed by the trustees in three weeks' time, will not be ﬁnalized until the summerl

By Sharyn Obsatz

While the new dorm isstill in the
planning stages, other construction
projects will begin this semester.

The renovation of SteinerHail is
scheduled to begin March lst. A
new wing will be added to the
building to house additional reli-
gious studies, philosophy,and edu—
cation department offices and
classrooms.

Park Street, from 6th SL to 10th
St, will be tom up in Mid-April.
The sueet will be re-guttered and
re-paved, and a new sewer line will
be installed. Also, Smith Hall and
Brown House (1316 Park) will be
remodeled over the summer.

The college-owned houses at
1019,1023, 1008 Park St. will be
torn down after the new dorm has

been completed. Tom Crady, Dean
ofStudcntAffairshas been advised
that the houses are not worth reno—
vatingl

The building ofa new Fine Ans
complex has been postponeddue in
part to lack offundingi Walker ex-
plainedthal, whilethecollegecould
borrow low interest federal funds
for housing such as the new dorm,
it is more difficult to get govern-
ment funding for an academic
building.

As the college President would
therefore shoulder much of the re
sponsibility to raise funds for the
project, the administration has dcr
cidcd to postpone the project until
the new President takes office. She
will then be able to take part in the
planning of the Fine Ans Complex
from its inception.

Rebuilding advances rapidly

Both Gardner lounge and
Hector’s have been vacated due to
the Harris center. Gardner lounge
will most likely be carpeted and
u-ansfonned intoa lounge for Main
hall, as the current lounge next to
Quad is often reserved formeetings

and speakers.

No decision has been made as
to the fate of Hector's, which still
awaits rebuilding.

Two long»tcnn options have
been proposed for Hoctor’s; the
space might house either a layout
room for the Scarlet and Black, or
the offices and radio studio for
KDIC. According to Tom Crady,
Dean of Student Affairs, both op
tions would be rather costly, and
neither has been chosen as of yet.
“We just don’t have the money
right now,” he said,
