well the junior varsity race went for a

non»varsity runners ran especially
well. It is always a pleasant outcome
to see more runners vying for varsity

Men's soccer uses uptempo play
to boost conference record

By Steve Johnston

The Grinnell Men’s Soccer Team
earned their second conference win
last Thursday against the Monmouth
Fighting Scots.

The game at Monmouth got off to
a fairly slow start. Grinnell appeared
a bit sluggish and ﬂat during the first
half, but managed to stay with the
Scots and kept the score even at 070.

As Grinnell stormed out onto the
field to resume play. reportedly a
mighty warcrypotued out from Coach
Pﬁtch’s lips,"Give thoseScotsHell! 1"
And that‘s exactly what Grinnell did.
Full of enthusiasm from his coach's
warbled bellow, sophomore Scan
Ramsey dribbled downfield and
scored after only 20 seconds of play.

Throughout the hushchonmouth
crowd the only words that could be
heard were,“Who was that Pioneer?"
They werejust about to find out.

According to one Grinnell player,
Ramsey‘s eyes were dark as coal and
his intensity as strong as an ox. After
several fceblcattempts on goal by the
Scom. Grinnell broke downfield pass»

ing the ball to each other like a well-
oiled Zamboni. The ball was passed
back towards the center, and thcn,
Ramsey smashed the ball into the
goal, making the score 2-0.

Play resumed and Grinnell and
Monmouth played with heightened
intensity. Outstanding play by
Grinnell sophomores Tim Edmunds
and Alex Kranjec, helped Grinnell
continue its uptempo play.

After diety-like passing from
sophomore Papa Owusu, and awe-
some defense from l-lodum,
Giebelhaus, and Schrager, Ramsey
was in another position to score.
Ramsey chipped the ball in from the
side and gave Grinnell a 30 lead,
Grinnell held Monmouth scoreless
[or the remainder of the second half
which gave them theirsccond confer-
ence win.

Grinnell's ncxt opponent. the Coe
Kohawks, wereobittougher than the
young and inexperienced Monmouth
Fighting Scots. The Pioneers were
expecting to play a team of remedial
hackers butwcre pleasantly surprised
to find out that they werc just plain

old remedial.

During the ﬁrst half of the match.‘
play was fairly fast and furious with a 1
lot ofaggressive intensity by the Pic-V
necrs. With 5 minutes remaining in
the first half, junior Bruno Alicke‘
scored on a direct kick. This ended.
the half with Grinnell ahead 1-0.

The second half was pretty evenly‘
matched but Grinnell shined through.
with outstanding play by sophomore
Mike Stenberg and cunning play by'
frosh keeper Nate Brennaman.‘
Throughout the second half the(
Kohawkswere lhwartedbyGrinnell’s
sound defensive play and excellentr

teamwork shown by the midfielders
and strikers. ‘

The game ended with Grinnell on.
top 1-0, earning their third confer-
ence win. ‘

Grinnell plays the Knox Siwasn
tomorrow on Mack Field at 1:00.,
Fans are welcome to come see the‘
Pioneers attempt to achieve an-
undefeated season.

Grinnellephants host triangular;
rally to Victory against Cyclones

By Joe Zimsen

The Grinnell College inter—colle-
giate men’s ultimate club, the
Grinnellcphants, invited three other
local teams to play in a tournament
lastwcckend.TheUniversityof Iowa
Huckeyes. the Iowa State University
Cyclones.and thel’cllaUltimateClub
all came to compete fielding strong
teams,

in the crisp September morning
sun, the Grinnellephants lost their
first game to thc l-Iuckcyes on East
Field. Traditionally, iowa has a strong
team, and “always makes a good
showing,”commentedGrinnellephant
captain Adam Miller. The Huckeyes
emerged with a 3.0 record to make a
clean sweep of thc tourney.

rallied late in the second half to de-

15—13.

in Grinnell's third and final game,
a tough Fella squad ruthlessly
pounded the tired Grinnell team 15-7.

Sophomore Mike Hanna explains
the score with the classic, ”it was a
closer game than the points showedt“
And perhaps accurately so. The
Grinnellphants werc“often fmstratcd
near the cm! zones," according to

Hanna. Several good drives disinlc-‘
grated at or near the goal line because,
of the inexperience of the Grinnell
squad. The determined Pella defensc‘
was also a prominent factor. .

The friendly tournament
amounted to an evaluation of thc‘
Grinnellephztnts‘ progress With the,
manrto-tnan and zone defenses. All
players honed their defensive skills
and even the rookies showed grea
progress throughout the tournament;

Rutledge led the offense and
backed the rookies up with tireless
defense. Shay played an all-around
good game. Captain Miller played
on an injurcd ankle until he w
forced to sit out in the third game. ,

The Grinnellelephants will travel
to the Sectional Championships on‘
October Sth and 6th.
