working toward recovery as long as
they handle it in a responsible mane
ner; te. not broadcasting names
and Circumstances. Geing through
the process or pressing charges is
difficult in itseltand haying every-
oncknow aboutitwouldonly serve
to make a delicate situation more
painful.

However, it is crucial that a VlCr
tim of sexual assault not be denied
his or her support system, that he or
she be permitted to talk through his
orherreactionsand maintaincloser
ncss with omens. We have no prob-
lem with kcepin g the offender's
name confidential zit this surge of
the process; we think it is for the
best. This brings us to the second
point we would like to clarity.

The Mum-Ethnic Coalition is
not the only group at Grinnell
concerned about such issues. The
President's Committee for a

been meeting since 1989 to rec-
ommend a multicultural agenda to

been to “Identify Grinnell nation-
ally and inlemationally as a mecca
for multicultural education and
thought," eslablish endowed chairs
for minority studies, address issues

The editorial entitled “Just Bcr

sound as it we advocate using the

the process, in fact, what we would
like to see is something more along
the lines of what the editorial staff
claimed as its opinion: that tltc

the college judicial processes find

not be kept secret, particularly in

that 1 can say. I do. however, have
one point to make. The message
that Student Affairs sends to those
victims or sexual abuse who go to
them is that the rights of the perpo

do, however. argue in favor of a

The committee has consistently
called for action from the “execu—

creation of“ari upper level adminr

address institutional advancement

community.”Thecommitteeis now
also committed to strong commu~

Ethnic Coalition.

Alexander, who was recently

she intends to focus heavily on
multicultural and multirethnic cur-
ricular issues. She is also calling

for an Ethnic Studies Department,
which would consist of an “inclu-

sive curriculum" to look at “issues
or ethnic groups in the United
States" and at a wide variety of
disciplines irum “many pcrspccr
lives." The depanrnent would bcr
gin as a concentration.

Alexander feels that the basis
for curricular change is already in
place at Grinnell, as {acuity and
administration support would be
necessary for the success of such
changes. A program in Ethnic
Studies would, she argued, aid re-
cruitment and go a long way to-
wards building Grinnell intoa truly
multicultural community.

who already knew I was going to
Student Affairs about my meeting,
that I should only say: “We dis-
cussed my options."

Yes. orcourse wediscussed my
optionsl Wc did not, however, in
discussing my options. deal with
my feelings. Options tire clcarrcut,
cold, and dry. Emotions are cone
fusing and scary; I've suttered from
anxiety, guilt, fear. and depression.
An lmportantstcpformeintlcaling

gagged me.

Now, because i have to protect
the rights of the very person who

to talk to my triends, my support

what this message ofsilencesays to
other victims of abuse. So many of
us have been taught by ourabuscrs
to keep our abuse to eurselrcsg
and StudentAlTatrs, by stipulating
"dctitl Silence.“ reinforces the
teachings of our abusers.

Should Student Affairs really
senda message asking the victim to
be responsible for the protection of
