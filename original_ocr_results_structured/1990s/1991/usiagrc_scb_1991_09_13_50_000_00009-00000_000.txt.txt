David Byrne

~branches out in The Forest

‘ By Brendan Riordan

David Byrne, international renaisr

' sance man and lead singer for the
. band Talking Heads, has recently re-
leased The Forest, his newest cre»
' ative effort. After a few years hiatus
1 from the Talking Heads and experi
mentation with various forms ofBra»

’ zilian music including three musical
- compilations, an album of his own,
A and even a US. tour with a 14 piece

Latin band. Byrne has now moved on
to a new area: classical music! This
guy can do just about anything

The pieces range from many which
use a full symphony orchestra, to
smallergroupsandevenasoloclassi-
cal guitar piece. Byrne even sits in
with a bit of opera singing on a few
pieces. For an unusual attempt at
blun'ing the thin lines between differ-
ent musical genres by renaissance
genius David Byrne, try The Forest.

And what a lovely noise it is. From
the opening song entitled “Counting

plays with sound, image, and overall

Petty makes mellow music
in the Great Wide Open

by Jason Walter

E

The 90’s have deﬁnitely been the
decade for Tom Petty, an artist who
has been struggling consistently since
the late 60's and early 70's. Following
the surprising reaction to Full Maan
Fever and now a wellrwrought re-
sponse to his rejoin with the Hean-
breakers, Into the Great Wide Open
(which features leff Lynne and Roger
McGuinn, among others, of Petty‘s
Traveling Wilburys experience) re-
unites Petty with his ever-faithful
backup band.

It's a tense experiment, but theother
Heartbreakers—notablyMike
Campbell, Stan Lynch, and Benmont
Tenchghave become highly re—
spected professionals in and out of

the studio, so lhatGreal Wide Open is
a working success.

Songs like the ﬁrst single “Learn-
ing to Fly,” “Kings Highway,” and
”The Dark of the Sun" all recount the
pastoral and minstrel stylization that
Fever instilled. Other songs encoun»
ter Wilburyesque transitions, mainly
“Into theGreat Wide Open” and“Two
Gunslingers." The amused, tongue~
in-cheek rockrand-roll of the Heart-
breakers is also evident in “Too
Good To Be True,” “Makin' Some
Noise." and “Out in the Cold," All in
all, Open is a consistent follow-up to
F ever-mot necessarilyabreakthrough
but, mankfully. a reassurance that

Petty still has it. And. hey, can‘twe >

all use just a little reassurance these
days?
