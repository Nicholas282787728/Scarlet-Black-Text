Financial Aid overexpends budget

 

By Kim Eckart

Despite minors of a ﬁnancial aid
“crisis"andcollege—widebudgetcuis,
the Office of Financial Aid
overexpendeditsbudgetforthe1991-
92 academic year. The increasein the
number of new and retuming stu7
dents directly affected the expendi-

tures, which rose from a predicted 1

$73 million loan actual $7.5 million.

According to Director of Student
Financial Aid James Lincoln, the
amount of money available for ﬁnan-
cial assistance did not decrease. “We
were budgeted for $7.3 million. More
students showed up than expected.
But we expended $7.5 million to help
those students who were late with
their ﬁnancial aid applications and
the unexpected number of new stu-
dents." Lincoln said.

Lincoln also noted that although
the college budget was tighter this
year, it was not inadequate for the
ﬁnancial aid ofﬁce. “This year be-
came a tighter circumstance because
of the available funds versus the num-
ber of smdentsreceiving aid," he said.
“The budget is projected by predict-
ing the number of returning and new
students, The number of students un-
expectedly increased

The ﬁnancial aid process is based
on an assessment of each student‘s
ﬁnancial situation. There are three
types of aid: scholarship (money
which is granted), work-smdy pro-
grams and loans. Each year, the ﬁe

plies that a standard was set whereby
a student would receive the same
amount of money each year. No
standard is set,” Lincoln said.
Moreover, the ﬁnancial aid bud-
getincreases every year, in fact. 1991-
92 is the ﬁrst year that the ofﬁce
overexpended its budget (see chart).

lege has been affected by the tighten-
ingofthcbudget,although somehave
felt the squeeze more than others.

Treasurer DaveClay explained that
the limited growth of the budget is
dueprimarilytcthecurrenteconomy.
in the 1970's and 1980‘s, the endow-
ment grew substantially: during the
1990‘s, however, the endowment is
leveling off. “The focus of the bud
get cuts has been on the administrar
iive side of the institution. The col-
lege does not want to sacrifice its
academic programs,” Clay said.

According to Clay. the college
does not plan to sacriﬁce the current
futancial aid procedure eithert “We
haven’t made any philosophical
change in ﬁnancial aid," he said.

The Budget Committee for the
1992-93 academic year hasnot begun
to meet, and no predictions are avail-
able for future budgets.

Students complain of Z
illegal magazine solicitersj

By Alex Lyda

Despite regulations prohibiting
solicitation, a roving band of door»to-
door salesmen has aggressively tar-
geted several campus residence halls
in an attempt to “win personality
points,” as the sales pitch goes, by
selling magazine subscriptions.

According to students interviewed,
the objective of the magazine drive,
as stated by the salesmen, is to sell
subscriptions by hawking their pare
sonalily.Thesaid reward for thehigh-
est number of personality points has
varied from “a trip to Europe" to a
“Meditemnean cruise.”

The solicitation has been described
by some as extreme. AiCXlS Powell, a
resident of Loose, said it was the
“ultimate clash between the inuovert
and the extrovert." “He knocked on
the door, walked in and stzirlod talk-
ing loudly like it was some kind of
forensics thing,” added Powell.

Stamatts Muratidis ofHaincs Hall
was approached while sleepinginone
of the rooms of his three bedroom
suite. According to Murat‘tdus, the
salesman had entered the lounge area
ofhis dorm around 10:00pm without
being invited in. “He pounded on my
door and then stancd speaking 40
words a second. I don‘t like people I
don’tlmow wakingmeup.”Muiatidis
said that the prices of the subscripe

tions were at least “twice as high as
other student discounts.” '
Sally Griffith of Loose Hall was
approached while entering the Loose'
loggia. “Two men asked to come up.
to my room withouttclling me why."
says Griffith. Griffith conceded and'
the two men then began their sales-
routine, Griffith purchased what she>
thought was a $12.00 year subscripa
tion to the popular science magazine‘
“Omni” but was handed a receipt in,
excess of $30.00. “I’ve sent the re
Ceipt back. I'm not going to pay.”
said Griffith. ‘
AtGates hallscveral students wcrg
so offended by the confrontational
approach of these salesmen that thc’
police were notified. While nobody,
was apprehendedthe affair prompted
the Office of Student Affairs to draft‘
up signs warning salespersons that.
solicitation is prohibited. The signs‘
are now being distributed to RA‘s for
postage in the residence halls. '
Accordingto OdaCallison,Dircc-,
tor of Student Housing, a similar
strain of salesmen forced their way‘
intoa female’s dorm room two years-
ago. “There is a sense of trust among
the students here that can be danger3
ous," said Callison. Callison wams-
thatalthough nothing happened,“ltis‘
important that students call 911 ifa
suspect person is seen roaming the'
residence halls."
