‘ home crowd.

. by the time the first quarter was half
over.BuccaneerrunningbacksShane
‘ Stadler and Steve Dixon scored three
,touchdowns in the quarter and then
spent die rest of the game wreaking
" havoc upon me Grinnell defense. The

Buccanner offensivelinewas “shong
and talented," said Wallace.

Making his retum from theinjured
list, quarterback Jeremy Hawkinson
led the offense passing for 177 yards
on 32 attempts. Despite Hewkinson's
return to the line-up, the more experi
enced Buccaneer defense shut down
the Pioneer offensive threat

While outgaining the Buccaneers
in theair, the Pioneers were unable to
contain the Beloit ground attack, The
Bucs rushed for over 260 yards while
the Pioneers were only able to man-
age 47 yards on the ground.

According to Wallace, the Pio—

neers had their opportunities to score,
“We ran over 30 offensive plays
without scoring a touchdown We
had the ball enough that we should
have scored."

Defensively, linebacker Lee
Kraemer led the Pioneer defense for
the third straight game. Kraemer. a
preseason AllAAmerican, completed
twenty tackles and was aided by
comcrbackTyMcguire,whorecorded
eleven tackles.

played a role in the second and third
sets, as they spiked their way to 15-9
and 15-7 victories. The women in
black did not falter, as they ﬁnessed
their way to a 15-8 fourth set victory.

In Ute final game, Coe regained

IN GRINNELL

Since 1961
OFTEN CHALLENGED...
NEVER SURPASSED

922 1/2 Main Grinnell, IA

By Don g Hodum

This past weekend, the women‘s
soccer learn traveled to Knox for a
tough conference game. Grinnell met
the challenge with a strong teatn ef-
fort and blanked the Siwash 8-0. The
Pioneers used balanced scoring with
seven different players putting the
ball in the net.

According toCoach EskildsenJhe
game was “as ﬁne a team effort this
early in the season as I’ve ever seen."
He noted that crisp passing and ag-
gressive defense was displayed by
the team.

The team defense has been superb
all season and continua to take the
pressure off the offense by prevent-
ing the other team from shooting and
scoring. Grinnell outshot their oppo—
nents 5675, anobvious indication that
the team defense is doing its job.

The goal scorers on Saturday were
Anya Schwartz, Melanie Parsons,
Marta Fraboni, Erin Kilgore with

two, Amy Necvel, Amy Jo Reinhart
and Julie Banuelos. The defense was
again anchored by Jen Wood, Guen
Gifford, and the “bookends,” Ris
Taylor and Jana Murchison. Behind
this formidable defense was the ever
ready Susan Flowers to stop those
few shots that trickled through to the
goal.

Wednesday, the women took on
the Kohawks of Coe. The team rushed
toanimmediateleadwhich meynever
lost. The scoring was led byJen Wood,
with two goals. Erin Kilgore, Amy
Necvel and Anya Schwartz all added
one apiece. Once again the defense
played very well and the midfield
held Coe in their own end for almost
the entire game.

This weekend the women travel
south to play two very tough teams,
nationally ranked Washington Uni-
versity anda Maryville leam.Coaclt
Eskildsen said that this weekend's
performance will be a key to the Pie
neers' future in the region,

Sticky Tongues pull off season

By Nora Bloch

lastweekend,StickyTongues,the
Grinnell Women’s Ultimate team,
played in the Fifth Annual Autumn
Equinox Tournament in Ann Arbor,
Michigan.

The Grinnellians teamed up with
three University of Iowa women to
compete against some of the best
women's ultimate teams iii the coun-
try.

Sticky Tongues began the day with
an inspirational statementfrom sopho-
more Coach Nyasha Spears. “For a
bunch of babes, we are way honedt"
The Sticky Tongues began the tour-
namentplaying theirold friends Nem-
esis, a nationally ranked club team
from Chicago.

After losing to Nemisis. Sticky
Tongues faced teams from Carelton
College and the University of [mi-
and, both of whom gave them ample
practice in zone breaking strategy.
Sticky Tongues Tanya Smith and

Susan McBumey, two new additions
to the team, gave fine running efforts
and kept the team humble with their
awesome headgear,

The fourth and toughest game of
the day matched Grinnell against
Spike, the Michigan club team ranked
first in the nation.

Next, Sticky Tongues did battle
with Zero Degrees, a club team from
Cleveland. Freshling Karin Watch
was a defensive machine and just
wouldn’t quit, despite a bum knee,
and defensively smashed down play
after play.

The toumamentlinally ended with
Grinnell’s sixth game of the day, an
exhausted attempt against the Minne-
apolis team, Belly Down. Senior Jen
Kern aided the Sticky Tongues on the
last two scoring passes and was inte~
gral to the grammatical structure of
the unflaggingly excellent songs
which the Grinnell team sang to each
of their opponents.
