“So what kind of people are you
looking to attract? Who do you want
rooming in here?” I asked leaning
‘ backinair conditionedeomt‘ort, noth-
ing like the dark, hot basement of a
'room I had grown used to.
‘Anybody who tsn 't rowdy," the
older man responded, adding with a
Wink," and who' S 21. ”

lbit of those winking, curveball, unr
der-thertzible kind of facts thatescape
vmost other people in the town of
Grinnell. Facts like how easy it is to
get a fake 1D and how many under-
aged drinkers are served regularly in

“It’s getting tough for diese busi-

compete with the big chains like
Walmart, andinaplacelikeGrinnell,
-you canjust hop' in your car and shop

leaned forward a bit, and a small
’smile formed on the comer of his

would spend more of their time get;

Only oysters are lackin g at this bar in the newly opened State Street Station.

All this sortof explains the auno-
sphere of The Bar It’ s black and
musty, the hatttrooms are the worse
{or wear, and neither the front not
back entrances are what city hall
would call the pride of the commu-
nity But the place does its job, and it
does it very well. People from the
college and from the town enJoy the
drinks and each other, and have a
place to come together when every-
thingelseintownissleepingsoundly.

The place has also done very well
for Larry Brian. So well, in fact, that
two months ago he opened up a sin
ond bar, named State Street Station,
on the comer of State and 4th. The
name explains the building to a T. It
sits on State street, and has served as
the town livery, auction house, ga»

rage and gas station since it was re
built' in 1923

“Yeah,l'dsayevery weekwe have
somebody come in here and tell us
how they used to sell pigs in here, or
tell stories about the older days of the
building, We had a guy in here a
couple of days ago who told us about
when he and his friends would steal
his uncle’s car from here when this
was the town’s garage and joy-ride
around the countryside and into Des
Moines," said Brian.

“See, cars are pretty much useless
around here in the winter - you can
neverget them to start in the cold, So
everybody would stick their car in
here, and they would heat the place
{or when you needed to get out”

The building still has more stories

to tell. Already some people have
started to get rowdy at the Station.
When Brian throws utem out. he’s
hearda fewofthem say, "I didn't like
the management there. Let’s go to
The Bar."

“They don’t realize that that‘s
mine, too!” laughed Brian.

To keep with it's past. Brian has
decorated the main room of the 5000
square foot bar with old gas station
signs. advertisements, and two au-
thentic gas pumps sitting on either
side ofa small stage. Two skylights
tower above the concrete floor, and a
soon-to»be-opened loft extends over
limbo’s and the ham-door enterancet
The second of two bars is a ram»
shackle, Caribbean-looking structure
with tin plates zigrzagging for a roof.

“Ernest Hemingway would be
proud,” Brian commented as he
walked over to show the thing oftt

limbo, born Jim Sadler and 1989
Grinnell graduate, is expanding his
pizza and Mexican restaurant along
with Brian's bar, The new restaurant
will haveit’sown privateeating area,
and will open up for lunch as soon as
remodeling is complete.

“We should do pretty well here.
The recession hasn‘t really hurt us
too much, and we‘re still doing deliv-
eriesil think the new place should
turn outpretty well," said Sadler.

The new place was refurbished
with the wood from an old place,
natnely the old Ponoreck—a combi-
nation bar, roller rink and bowh'ng
alley that closed down a number of
years ago. Wood that Brian saved
from the bowling lanes and the roller
rink ﬂoor went into building State
Street Station.

“I’d say about 90 percent of the
wood in here is recycled,” estimated
Brian,

“And Jim and I did a lot of the
work to fix the place up ourselves.”

So ifyou’re 21—or have an ID, as
Larry Brian so thoughtfully reminded
me on my way outeand feel like
getting away from the crowded con-
ﬁnes of The Bar, try the new place in
town It’s not so new, after all.
