GENDER ISSUES AT GRINNELL

Some women see sexism on campus

By Jennifer Vacchiano

“i think sexism is everywhere,“
said one student “It’s like racism,
you will encounterit everywhere you
go”

Does this opinion represent the
general viewpoint of women on cam»
pus? Do they feel that there is sexism
at Grinnell. and are female students
expecting to face sexism after leaving
Grinnell'.7

Most femaleGrinnell students sur-
veyed agreed that there is sexism on
campus, both in the classroom and on
me social scene.

”To some extent sexism is not
talked about here because this cam~
pus is a liberal one, but sexism is

ingrained in our society, so it does
exist at Grinnell, in men and women
both," said Rachel Landsbcrg.

Many students spoke of a subtle
sexism. Landsberg noticed that"men
often dominate a class, or sometimes
professors teach more towards men."
This is not the fault of male students
or teachers, she felt, but rallicr an
“unintentionalrcsultofgrowing upin
the American school systems.”

Katherine McNulty noted that in
the classroom “guys are more verbal
than women...and when working in
small groups, males tend to dominate
and take charge of the group."

I ennifer Kern, a leader of the For
litically Active Feminist Alliance
(PAPA), felt that "sexism by omis-

“Secretary” overlooked?

__——

When Berneil Mueller took the
job of Fine Ans secretary, she was
wamedby theprevious secretary that
theposition“reallywasn'tsecretarial."

Soon Mueller was working over-
time,planningconcert schedules.pre-
paring publicity,making reservations
for rehearsals and concens, and over-
seeing student registration for private
lessons and ensembles

Mueller worked overtime to get
her duties done. She had a great deal
of autonomy and her activities were
primarily self-in" 'ated. She also su-
pervised a technician working in the
Fine Arts building.

It occured to Mueller that maybe
the title “faculty secretary" didn't
really describe her job classiﬁcation,
that maybe her job was more admin-
istrative in character. Money wasn't
the issue for Mueller, it was the prin-
ciple of the matter that she cared
about.

Yet she didn't say anything.

"My generation of women wasnot
broughtuptobeassertiveaboutthings.
Iwas taught that if you do a good job,
you'll be recognized for it. You don't
have to blow your own horn," said
Mueller. "I noted that other jobs on
campus once labeled 'secretary' were
being changed to 'administrative as-
sistant' and thought my job would
soon be recognized also."

She was wrong. The science
departments had asked the adminis-
tration to give administrative status to
technicians so better qualiﬁed candi-
dates would apply for the science
technician jobs. Their request was
granted. The technician thatMueller
had been advising was given admin-
istrative status while she remained a
secretary.

Mueller and Music Department
Chair J on Chenette unsuccessfully
petitioned the administration to have
Mueller's position changed. They
were told that a faculty secretary was
too closely linked to the faculty to be
administrative and that technicians
could have administrative status be-
cause they worked irregular hours.

One administrator responded,“Ev-
eryone knows what Bemeil Mueller

does.“ Mueller interprets this state»
ment to mean. “it's not important to
officially recognize what Berneil
Mueller does with a job classifica»
Lion."

”Idon'tlotowiflcanreally say I'm
the vicum of sexism," said Mueller,
cautiously. “Few men would be
doing the jobl'm doingandstickwith
it, or do it and remain categorized as
I am."

"ltwas so easy to move a group of
people that was predominantly male
into administrative status but it's
impossible to move one woman. No
one has ever said that I do not do
administrative work,” she added.

"I don‘t care to make a comment
from memory on something that hap-
pened too long ago," said Waldo
Walker. the administrator oversee
ing the promotion process at the time
Mueller was denied administrative
status. "Inever had a year that] didn't
have at least four or ﬁve people un-
happy with their status."

Cheneue believes sexism was not
behind Walker's decision. “I know
with some cenainty that Vice Presi-
dent Waldo Walker make the deci-
sion for other reasons. He was lob-
bied effectively by several science
depanrnents.”

Chenette hopes that President
Ferguson's hiring of a Vice President
for Human Resources will rmult in a
predictable, clear and [air system of
job classiﬁcations.

Even if her job classiﬁcation re
mains thesame,Muellersaid she will
probably stay at her job, which she
has had for 16 years. "I do like the
job. I like the ans; 1 like thecombina-
tion of organization and creativity,
the problem solving that the job of-
fers," she explained.

“I don't want to work at something
and be angry and demoralized‘, I will
try toleave the angerbehind. Frankly,
I'm tired of talking about the matter.
But the larger quﬂtion should be
asked: How many women are there
on campus and in the larger work
force who are doing administrative
workbutnotbeing recognized forit?
I suspectother women on campus are
in similar situations. Protests about
this should continue.”

sion” of women’s experiences and
contributrons to history occurred in
some classes.

Regarding the campus social
scene, McNuity summed up a come
mon belief that"pcopleoften fall into
the stereotypical roles expected of
them because of their gender." She
also noted that “males control con-
versation more than women - not that
women don‘t speak, but they don’t
control or direct conversation."

Not all female students. on the
other hand. share this point of view.
Many students expressed that they
never felt or were aware of sexism at
Grinncll. "I’ve feltit[sexism] outside
ofGrinnell," one student said, “butl
really do not find it here."

Contrary to the belief that“sexism
by omission" occurred inclassrooms,
Karen Nutter felt that her professors
“made a conscious effort to use
women's literature and teach
women‘s history." and she has “never
seen professors give preferential treat-
ment to men."

All students intervieweddid agree.
however. that they will face sexism
after graduating from Grinnell. As
Nutter put it, "I am not expecting a
Utopia.” The experiences of several
female professors on campus support
this expectation

AmericanStudiesProfessorI-lanna
Griff attended Grinnell College from
1977 to 1981. She said that1 back
then, she had "never heard of sex-
ism;” she thought it was something
“angrywomen were making up.” She
was taken by surprise, however, after
graduating.

“Tire school was always very en»
couraging, but after graduating, I re-
alized that the world was very differ
ent. All my males friends got entry
level jobs, and all I could get was
secretarial work, although we had the
same qualiﬁcations. lttook me about
a year to register what was happen-
ing,” said Griff.

“Both college and parents educate
forsuccws,“said Anthropology Pro-
fessor Kathryn Kamp, a member of
the Women’s Alliance. Sexism in
institutions willbesubtle,shewarned,
and it might make women “question
their abilities."

Education professor Roberta
Atwell, a member of the Grinnell
faculty for 18 years, said, "Yes, sex-
ism exists, but it is better in some
ways." The percentage of women on
the faculty increase from 16% to 39%
since 1973, Atwell did want that sex-
ism might appear in subtle forms and
that“many women are reporting that
they can only get so far,"

According to Atweli. this sexism
is not always perpetrated by men.
She feels it’s important to realize that
one'ssex does notdctennine whether
or not you do sexist things; sexism
toward women is not only a male
characteristic.

What can one do about sexism on
campus or in the job market? Griff
advocates that men and women admit
that sexism exists and then say to

 

themselves. “butI can supercede it."

 

Why men did

not attend

women’s leadership talks

By Joshua Ford

Last week‘s symposium on
women’s leadership developed sevA
eral distinguishing characteristics,
including itsapparenttimclrness,cor-
responding with the arrival of
Grinnell’s first female president,
Pamela Ferguson: the considerable
crowds which the symposium drew
during the opening weeks of school:
and the under-representation of men
at symposium events.

When men were questioned as to
why they didn‘t attend the events.
most unifomtly responded, "I didn’t
have time.” Some added, "A couple
of the topics sounded interesting.”
However, when asked to elaborate,
many respondents questioned why
they, as men, should be interested in
a symposium on women ’s leadership.

“it wasn‘t something that really
interested me. I didn't feel likeI had
a stake in it," said onestudent. Others
were more blunt, responding “I’m
not a woman, so why should I go.”
Some claimed that they were already
knowledgeable about the issues and
“had a pretty good handle on the
subject."

One person was unenthusiastic

about the focus of the symposium,
stating, “If it was another women’s
issue like domestic violence, which
seems more urgent and more of an
injustice," then he would attend.

When asked if a symposium on
African-Americans or racism would
have encouraged a greater male turnr
out, one man questioned whether the
two could be equated. “Race issues
are so much easier to examine than
gender issues. Women’s issues are
less obviously a problem,” he said.
Anotltcr student pointed out that at-
tendance at last year’s symposium on
Civil Rights had less than exemplary
turnout.

Some respondan conveyed an
antipathy towards feminists and the
women's movement in general.
“They [feminists] think that all men
are out to get them, and they need to
shut all men down, when most men
think they have the same rights and
wouldn‘t think of discriminating
against them."

While the student didn’t deny the
existence of sexism in America, he
did feel that. "there are better ways to
deal with it than reverse sexistmove-
ments, which is what a lot of femi-
nists groups have become.”

PresidentPamelaFergusonis not,
in her words, “a novelty."

Although she is Grinnell’s first
woman president, Ferguson believes
she is perceived more as Grinnell's
eleventh president. rather than the
first woman in such aposition.

Her experiences at Grinncll thus
far, she said, have been positive:
however, these experiences contrast
sharply with the beginnings of her
career as a “visiting“ assistant pro~
fessor at the University of Miami 20
years ago. She said her hiring pro
cess was more extensive than that
for men in the same position; oven
the teaching environment, she said,
was "Very chilly."

Ferguson said she has not experi-
enced such sexismatGrinnell. “You
can feelwhen you‘reinteracting with
someone who has sexist views, and
lhaven’tfound that here. Idcn’tfeel
that my gender is a problem," she
said.

After serving as the dean of the
graduate school of the University of
Miami, where women comprise
about 20% of the faculty (the na-
tional average). Ferguson empha»
sized the "comfortable" lack ofsex-
ism at Grinnell, where women com-
prise nearly 38% of the faculty.

At the University of Miami,
Ferguson said she encountered sex-
ism earty in her career as a research
mathematician; in fact. she said she

faced many obstacles in the initial
hiring process.

"They did everything they could
to stop me,” she said. "However,
that was 20 years ago, and today
such oven sexist behavior will land
you in court."

Ferguson said that her experi-
ences at the University of Miami
enabled her to realize the impor-
tance of a non-sexist faculty, "l’ve
realized the value of a supportive
faculty. which is why we need a
diverse faculty. 1 have come to
believe that role models are impor-
tant," she said.

FergusonalsonotedthattheGrin-
nell cnvironmentappears more open
to the discussion of gender issues
than many campuses around the
country. “One of the things I liked
aboutGrinnell was that the students
areintellectuallyalive.l‘mgladl’m
at an institution that is sensitive to
these issues," she said. "It’s scarier
when you're at an institution that
doesn't discuss them."

Although Ferguson said that the
number of women faculty at Grin-
ncll and the open atmosphere of the
institution are positive signs of a
lack of sexism, she also said that the
college should continue to increase
the number of women and pcopleof
color on the faculty.

“If a faculty does not care about
women and people of color, then
they don‘t care about students," she
said.
