jobs orto oil (though he is), but
rather a threat to the stability of the
world order. He is not merely
another mad despot making a land
grab. but rather a cold, calculating
dictator who has a vision of himself
as a world player. He has at his
disposal the world’s founh largest
armyand enough oil moneytomake
this dream an eventual reality. This
also terrifies me.

I can not allow my hatred
of warm cloudmyjudgmenL People
seemingly forget that everyone,
from the Generals on down, hates
war and knows that the only good
thing about it is its ending. These
people have seen the ﬁeld of battle
andknow the honors it entails. They
donot,however, ignore Lherealitiu

ofthe situation. Saddam Hussein is
not about to negotiate ovchuwait.
no matter how many times the
French talk about linkage, When
people mention that Bush rejected
linkage they seem to forget that
Hussein rejected the French and
UN proposals as well. People talk
aboutsanctions,and about the CIA ’s
report that lheyare having an effect.

People, however, ignore that
the reportalsostates thatthceffccts
are not on his troops in Kuwait. but
on the children and elderly people
of Iraq, How many of them would
die in the one to three years that it
would take for sanctions to be
effective if they would be effective
at all? Is our blood so precious that
we would allow Iraq’s Kurdish
community(morethanthrcemillion
people) to starve. while we waited

for Iraq to kindly leave Kuwait?
Can we allow our fear and loathing
of war to make ourselves so selfr
centered?

1 cannot and will not forget my
friends who our now serving in the
Gulf. I pray for them, and l fear for
their lives I know, however. that if
they did not fight new, they would
instead ﬁght later. TheHussein they
will face in five years would be far
better armed and far more prepared
than the one the world faces today.
Conﬂict between the world and
Saddam Hussein is inevitable. The
world, it seems. has tot) soon
forgotten the lesson of Munich: itis

Iran he did. He said he would seize
Kuwait, and shortly afterwards he
claimed it as the 19th provrnce of
Iraq. He has also in the past lifted
his saberto theworld, claiming that
he would show the world what

The message he sends is loud and
clear, I pray to G—d that we will be
