by the bar stools from Hoctor‘s.
The future home of GORP was
being used as storage space for
leftover construction materials. As
the tour group moved about the
center, they were frequently warned
to be careful of wct paint.

and delays, the Harris Center will
officially open tonight with the
7:30pm screening of “Strange
Brew" in the Cinema.

Group cites disinterest in
Native American students

By Craig Wacker

According to Native American
Interest Group member Thom
Berger, Grinnell College hasn’t
made concerted efforts to recruit
NaLive Americans. Berger was
frustrated with the fact that admin-
istrators didn't think recruiting
Native Americans was viable.
Berger stated “this is a feasable
idea."

Berger added that programs cm-
ployed in other places could work
equally well with Native Ameri-
cans. He cited the“! have a Dream"
program as an example. Bergeralso
mentioned the negativity he en
countered when dealing with vari-
ous administrators. He said that
when he talked to John R. Hopkins
about nativcamerican recruitment,
Hopkins didn't want to Work with
the group. He added that a former
scholarship for Native Americans
had been cancelled.

Berger rc»cmphasizcd the
feasability of recruiting Native
Americans with the fact that the
Tama sttlement is only 45 minutes
away. In reference to a program
dealing with Native Americans he
said “the time is right for that. it
would be a shame to soc it go.“

John R, Hopkins, director ofadr
missions. said that Grinnell is not
closely pursuing the recruitrncntof
Native Americans because they
“suffer from a lack ofpreparalion."
In general, Hopkins stated that it
was a “societal problem." Both
Hopkins and admissions assistant
Jody Hester said that the quality of
education most Native Americans
rocieve is not enough lobe enrolled
atGrinnell. Hopkins stated that the
Bureau of Indian Affairs doesn’t
provide ample encouragement for
Native American students to finish
their educations.

Hester lalcr Slated that admit~
ling Native Americans that had in-
sufﬁcient preparation for Grinnell
would be setting them up to fail.
Trying to carry on an education at
Grinnell white catching up on ma-
terial inadequately taught in sec-
ondary schools would be too much
for most students said Hester. She
added that someone could be
“highly modvawdl‘and “bright" but
still could still fare poorly at
Grinncll, Hopkins stated that stu-
dents who arecurrenlly at Grinnell
are both“bright“and“educationally
advantaged.”Berger believes that
Hopkins is"missing the pointcom-
plclcly."
