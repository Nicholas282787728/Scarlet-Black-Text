By Andrew Rutledge

With the tresh scent of spring
playing on their trunks, the
Grinnellephants ultimate team
opened the season with two week-
ends ofexciungdiscplayﬂn March
12 the Grinnellephant men herded
themselves over to Fella, Iowa
where they took on the U. of Iowa
and the powerful Pella club team.

In the ﬁrst game against Iowa
the pachyderms immediately got
into the swing of things by losing
the ﬁrst 4 points, This deficit was
soon ameliorated and eventually
overcome as Grinnell won 13-11.
In the next game the
Grinnellephants suffered no such
Sluggishness and touted the Pellzt
discmen 1177. Each player on the
team played an important role as
Grinnell achieved their first victo-
ries against the two Iowa teams,
and Claimed bragging rights as the
best learn in the Slate.

Three weekends later in
Lawrence, Kansas, the stampeding
Grinnellephants were once again
‘on parade.‘ Dramatically entering
the playing field in elephant trunk
bunny hop formation, the Grinnell
discels were ready for blood The
air of gaiety was quickly smashed

as the cagey veterans of the ‘Dude
Sanchez' team thrashed the
Grinnellcphants by the score of 137
4. Uncowed, the Grinnellcphants
rushed back to smite Team Ad-
equate (K. Stale) and Liquid Diet
by scores of 1378 and 13710. In the
two unimportant games that re-
mained that day the kind men of
Grinnell allowed their opponents
to win.
