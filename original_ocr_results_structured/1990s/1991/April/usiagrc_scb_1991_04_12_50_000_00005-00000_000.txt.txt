Listening in on the world, radio
enthusiasts found campus Club

By Karin Bellomy

The word “radio, to most
people, means tuning into a favor
ite AM orFM station, but Grinnell
ﬁﬁlege's DX Club hasothcr ideas.

The club‘s interests revolve
around the fascinating areas of
shortwave and ham radio, areas
completely toreign to many North
Americans. Since both shortwave
and ham radio can transmit inter-
nationally. both offeropponunities
to team more about other cultures.

However, the two systems are
used differently. Ham radio inc
volves two-way communications
between amateuropeiatorsliccnscd
by their governments. and ham
operators are not allowed to use
ham radio forany kind ofcommer-
cialor professional benefit. It costs
nothing to talk on a ham radio cx.
cept what the radio, antenna and
batteries themselves cost, and ope
craters benefit by establishing new
friendships or being able to cxpund
language skills by talking with
foreign operators.

Although the Operators, or
“hams,” can use the radiosjust for
fun, they can also use them to per-
form public services. Scott Johns
son, who started the DX Club late
last semester, says ofthe hams, “in
natural disasters they‘re the first to
establish communication.” After

Speaker pessimistic

Soviet economist Sergei
Shatorov spoke on campus Friday
on the topic “The Successes and
Failures of Perestroika”. Shatorov
has done a large arnountof research
on Sovieteconomtcs in thepast few
years, and brought aﬁrstrhiind view
ofthe situation in the Soviet Union.

“The shift to the right in Soviet
politics in recent months is quite
evident. . .almosttoo evident to be
completelytrue,"saidShatamv.But
the changes already instituted by
Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev have made an atmo-
spherefarmoreconducivetochange
and progress regardless of the re-
cent”shiftto theright",heclaimcd.

Shatorov Cited progress in agri-
culture and in growth or indepen-
dent businesses and banks as suc-
cesscsofperestro'tka. Although the
Soviet economy is currently un-
stable and uncompetitive, many
industrial banks and corporations
have sprung up and have shown
exceptional strength. A new “en-
trepreneurial class" has emerged
since privatimtion. This new class
tncttes more business and stimu-
latesgrowth. Inagriculturc,desptte

advances have been made. Shatorov

healthy and functioning at accept
able levels.

contacteda friend ofmine and said.
‘We need the Red Cross and these
particular antibiotics.m The friend
relayed the message to the Red
Cross, which took action to help the
Jamaicans.

Another Service hams can pro-
vide is “third party oatrtc." For
example, if an international student
on campus wants to talk to his or
her parents and knows of a ham
near the parents, a ham on campus
can establish communication with
the other ham, and the student and
parents can talk to each other free

The Military Afﬁliated Radio
Service (MARS), which according
tolohnsonis“aprofessionalsnt‘ton
operated by ham amateurs" started
by the military in the 19303, has
been relaying messages from fami-
lies to troops stationed in‘the Per-
sian Gulfduritig the recent war. By
January 4, MARS had handled
70,000 MARSGRAMS and 10,000
phone patches (direct conversa-
tions) between troops and ramtitcs,
services which apparentlyhavc had
a very moving effect on the sol-
diers.

Shortwave radio, on the other
hand, requires no operating license
and carries major international
broadcasts such as the BBC (Erit-
lsli Broadcasting Corporation),
Radio France and Radio Moscow.

But Shatorov extensively deline
eated the struggles of the Soviet
economy and the shoncomings of
perestroika. Theruble,whieh isnot
convenibte into other currencies,
has lost value since perestroika has
been implemented. Citing black
market exchange rates, Shatorov
explained how the ntbte has re-
cently dwindled from 8—10 rubles
per dollar to 35 rubles per dollar.

Funhermore, toreign investors
are reluctant to take part in the
Soviet scene because of the ruble
and its convertibility situation.
Since the Soviet government de-
cided tocounterio indebtedness by
printing more money, Shatorov
claims the Soviet Union is “ch1 on
its way down the Polish road" to
hyper inﬂation and price shocks.

The move toward privatization
has been a necessary step, accord-
ing to Shatorov, but has created
many problems for consumers. As

Shortwave also carries clandestine
stations run by people secretly try-

transmit ship to ship communica-

communications and even infor-

trying to set up a drug delivery.

Shortwave radio also differs
from AM/FM radio in that fre-
quencies for each station change
according to “propagationcondie

New group calls for
multiculturalism

By Sarah Purcell

There is growing concern in the
United States surrounding the
conceptof multicultural education.
The move toward multicultural
education is being considered here
atGrinnell,andanactivcmovement
has arisen toaddrcss both issues of
ethnic minority presence on cam-
pusandamulticultumlcurrieulum.

Ethnic minorities comprise a
greater portion of the population in
the United States than ever before,
andevidenccindicntes the numbers
will continue to grow. The New
York Times reported March 1 i that
“one in five Americans” has “Afr
t-ican,Astan,i-iispantc,orAmet-ican
Indianancestry."Duringthe1980’s
lheCilucasiart population in Ith.S.
increased only 6%, while African
Americans increased 13.2%, Asian
Americans 107.8%, Native
Americans 37.9%, Hispanic 53%,
and “other" minorities by 45.1%.
Thesegr‘owingnumbcrshaveforccd
the recognition of multicultural is-
sues by middle America.

The major components of a
multicultural program consist of
gaining and maintaining ethnic di-
versity on a campus, instituting a
multicultural curriculum, and edu-
catingthecampuscommunityabout
the experiences and culture of ethr
nic minorities in the United States.

All of these issues were ad
dressed this week here at Grinnell
during a symposium cosponsored
by the Multi-Ethnic Coalition and
the Rosenfield Program in Public
Affairs, International Relations, and
Human Rights. The symposium
focused on demographic changes
tn the United States, coalition
building in the ethnic community
and with the rest of the college, and
the need for a more multi-ethnic
curriculum including an Ethnic
Studies department. lunior Alla
Zapmdslry called the symposium
“the first symposium ofits kind in
the history of Grinnell College."

The Multi-Ethrlic Coal' 'on.
which planned the symposium, is a

neworganizationoncampus,and is
takingalead in pushing for greater
multiculturalism at Grinnell. The
Coalition is composed of repre-
sentatives from ASIA, CBS,
Chalutzim. and the Student Organ
nization of Latinos/Latinas (SOL)
and is affiliated with the Native
American Interest Group. The prie
mary goals ofthe group are laid out
in its constitutionasthe“pttrsuitof
multi-ethnic diversity and aware-
ness of/sensitivity to multir
clhnicity" at Grinnelt. It plans to
work towards these goals by seek-
ing “a positive, active response to
its agenda by the Grinncll College
Administration and Faculty."

Even though it is only in its first
year, several individuals think that
the Coalition has started down the
right path to reach its goals. Part of
its strength lies in the fact that the
group is composed entirely of stu»
dents and is advised by Eric Wynn,
Director of Multicultural Affairs,
and Rabbi Sharon Stiefel.

India Weston said that she feels
it is good for ethnic minorities “to
work together more on a regular
basis."shethinksthattheCoalition
will be “very beneﬁcial to not only
the groups that it represents, but to
the college as a whole."

Carmen Misol,asenior,saidthal
astde from curricular issues, the
Coalition must combat “basic in»
difference of the majority of
campus towards mullirethnic eon-
cems.” She believes that a small
campus such as Grinnell has the
potential to “pull together" iii a
meaningful way. In her opinion,
the MultirEthnic Coalition is “go-
ingtobeagreatwayforthecampus
to make a difference in diversity."

MinnieAlexander,asenior,sai ‘
“Having a Coatition..,givcs vise
ibility of the various ethnic
groups to a campus as a whole."
Shesaid thattheCoalition provides
a way for ethnic groups to work
together, express concern about
their roles on campus, and to
