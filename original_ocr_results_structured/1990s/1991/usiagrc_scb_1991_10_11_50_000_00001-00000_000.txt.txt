City dismisses proposed
parking ordinance

By Steve Clem

Aproposod city parking ordinance
which would potentially limit park-
ing on Park St., East St., and 10th
Avenue was unanimously set asidein
last Monday‘s city council meeting.

The proposal was recently intro»
duced in order to alleviate problems
with snow removal, street sweeping,
and congestion on the three streets
which border the campus. Under the
ordinance, altematc parking would
have been pcnnittod during the day,
while all parking would have been
banned between the hours of 1:00 am
and 5:00 am.

City Manager Ted Clausen sug—

concerns expressed by those in the
community opposed to such a pro-
posal.

Clausen emphasized that the pro
poszil did not alleviate parking on
those streets altogether, and the pri»
mary concern was the removal of
snow.

“I had suggested that they not act
on the proposed ordinance. The rea-
sonforthis wasthatthere werealotof
different stories and complaints on
why it shouldn‘t be done,“ said
Clausen.

“I didn't see any problems with
leaving it for now until we can work
for a betterplan with the college, and
get an idea of the number of parking
spots provided by the college," added
Clausen.

Polish educators observe
Grinnell for reform ideas

By Bridget Julian

A group of fourteen university pro-
fessors and administrators toured
Grinnell College last Monday, as the
final stage in their tourofUS. educa-
tional facilities.

The tour. organized by the United
States Information Agency, included
liberal arts Colleges such as Harvard
and Claremont college, state univer»
siu'es Such as Chapel Hill, and a vari-
ety of graduate and technical pro-
grams.

Upon their return to Poland, the
group hopes to establish educational
modifications based on their experi-
ences at U.S. institutions. Aftero tour
of Grinnell Middle and Senior High

Schools, the group assembled at
Cowles for lunch and a discussion of
higher education in Poland

At present, Poland has eleven uni-
versities. As in theUrsr, these schools
are divided into faculties for sciences,
humanities, social sciences, and arts
Unlike the U.S., all Schools are state-
sponsorod and thus free to anyone
who passes the entrance examina-
tion,

Last year, however, Poland spent
only six percent of its budget on edu»
cation, and administrators realized a
need for increased and funding.
