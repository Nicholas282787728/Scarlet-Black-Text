The politics of parking

So you didn’t pay the $20 or $40 to legally park your car in one of the
designated college lots. Instead, you park along one of the streets behind
your dorm, You try to remember to move your car once a day. You figure
you’ll accept the inconvenience and save money.

If the proposed parking ordinance passes,you might wantto rethink your
strategy, You’llbe parking at leastanother block away and vying for the same
choice spots. And the trek to your car will seem much longer in the middle
of February.

The simple way to avoid this inconvenience is to pay the price of a parking
sticker, However, this brings to mind last year’s parking sticker dilemma,
students who do not or cannot pay
the parking fees will be forced to
park elsewhere.

Funhermore, the proposed ordi-
nance would likely affect more stu-
dents on North Campus than on
South. There is no lot behind the
dorms on North Campus, and many
students park along Park Street for the convenience.

Yet administrators argue that the college offers enough parking spaces for
the number of registered student vehicles. What about those who have not
registered their vehicles with Special Services? Clearly, these are the
students who park on the Su’oels most often. It is difficult to determine the
number of student vehicles that are not registered, and to assume that there
are enough spaces for everyone is plain guesswork.

Moreover, as SGA President Matt Stippich said, rmricting nightparking
on East Street Park Street and 10111 Avenue would only shift trafﬁc
congestion to other nearby streets, and the issue of snow removal would thus
remain a problem for the alternative streets, as well.

Although it is necessary to acknowledge that daily street parking tends to
become crowded (especime on Park Street), the solution is not to further
limit night parking, The college should either offer more off»street parking,
or the college should challenge the ordinance The proposed ordinance
would affect a number of students, and the administration should fight for
student needs rather than remaining inactive.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Students defend professor Professor

To the editor,

We were dismayed, but not sur-
prised, by an article written in the
Grime]! Spectator, under the title
“Observations,“ aboutone of the few
professors of color at Grinncll Col-
lege. As students of color, we found
the article inaccurate as well as a
cancer to the Grinnell Multicultural
Community,

The article states that Professor
Mootry regularly used the word ML
and the phrase“Jesus fucking Christ“
in class. Of the three of us, one of us
is currently a student in Professor
Mootry’s class and testifies that the
word M was only used once, in the
contextwhcre aquote was taken from
a Milwaukee police of ficer‘s conver-
sation. Besides, other professors use
profanity, but they were not the pre-
ferred targetof the writer. Our ques
tion is why was Prof. Mootry chosen
as an example of professors who use
profanity?

Italso appears to us that the writer
isimplyingEurocenLrism necessarily
leads to one’s articulation. The ar-
ticle states that “...articulate speech
is a vestige of Euroccntrism." The
implication is that since Prof. Mootry
does not always teach from a
Eurocentric perspective, she is not an
articulate speaker. We can further
extrapolate from this quote that Prof.
Mootry, in not maintaining a
Eurocenu-ic perspective, has some
how regressed, in terms of her aca-
demic abili es.

In addition, the converse to the
argument that Eurocentrism denotes

articulation is that non—Eurocentrism
denotes inarticulation, And since
Eurocentrism is attributed to theCau-
casian race, those belonging to non-
Caueasian races are therefore inarr
ticulate.

Clearly this ”Observation" article
exemplifies the racist views held by
its author.We ask,sinceolherprofes-
sors use profanity in class, why was
Prof. Mootry singled outott thiscount?
Do race and/or sex figure into the
answer to this question? We believe
the Grinnell Spectator has definite
masons for targeting Prof. Mootry,
and readers should keep the author’s
subjectivity in mind when reading
this publication.

Carpet meant for a good cause

To the editor,

What a waste! The carpet warp
thatwasspreadaroundthecampuson
Saturday night was stolen from the
weaving workshop in Darby. I teach
that workshop, and I am also helping
witharug-weavingprojecttttSecond
Mile.

This weaving project is a recy-
cling endeavor, for it uses old jeans
and corduroys and makes beautiful.
usefulproducts. The amountofwarp

that was wasted on the prank Satur-

day night was about 28,000 yards, or
17 miles, of warp.

Grinnell College students,inlarge
pan, care about conserving the re-
sources of the planet, and they care
about helping those who need help.
Second Milc is dedicated to those
concerns. Those ofwho are working
with the project are saddened by the
destruction of useful materials. I am
ccnain thatat least some in the cam-
pus community are saddened by the
theft.

EYES WIDE OPEN
Waking up to multiculturalism

Multiculturalism seems to be on
everyone‘s agenda recently. Presir
dent Ferguson is stressing it, Conser-
vatives are whining about it, white
middle-path Liberals are engraving it
all on their brains. White middle-path
Liberals are iheones who necessarily
shouldbeengravingitontheirbrains.
Multiculturalism is, after all, a white
concept. If itwere an African-Amen»
can, et. al. concept, it wouldn’t be
called multiculturalism. It would be
called Waking Up.

The most amazing thing about
being white is that I get to say “Afri»
can»American, et al." The power of
reducing everything that isn't like me
into an abbreviated Latin phrase is
bizarre at best. Multiculturalism is
reallybizarre.Iﬁnditpersonzillyfrus-
trating to besurrounded byiand par-
ticipating ingwhitc guilt. White
people who know and acknowledge
those around them who are notwhite,
still must confront their own white-
ness and realize that it will not go
away, I know; I've tried. Even as I
write this article. clearly I atn ad»
dressing only those who are white.
Who else spends the time reading
what they already know?I I might pos-

Shelly West

sibly win the grand prize for extended
wallowing in white guilt. In saying so
I not only try to communicate that
which I know, butI ﬂy to gain recog-
nition for my efforts in combating
racism. I am the racial equivalent ofa
Sensitive New Age Guy. I want a pat
on the back,

White people urge those who are
not like them to teach them how to be
more open-minded. How can we in»
clude your perspective? How can we
be more inclusive? How can we meet
your needs? The answer is that we
can't, The answer is that we can’t
absolve all misdeeds with our good
intentions. Thegroveling is useless at
bestand insulting at worst. How dare
we ask other people into our circles
for theircultural information, only to
shut them out when thesymposium is
over? Multiculturalism must begin
and end with ourselves. Open your
own mind, Think about it yourself.

Let us not, however, assume that
various multicultural groups are unA
moving,notstriving upwardsandout,
not progressing, not being political.

Let us not assume, as is typical, I
think, thatthesepeoplearenotchang-
ing their values and exceeding the
dominant culture. Do not assume that
thesepeople are notplacing demands
upon the world around them. Let me
tell you something: They move and
they shake. The oblivion of the white
world is shaking from the roots up.
Stand back, That’s all you can do.
That’sall you shoulddo, Theprogress
made by the cultural movements did
not come from your being open
minded, and that glory is not yours.

Noticesomething yctilhavemadc
an assumption. I have assumed
multiculturalism to mean non-white.
I have not mentioned Queers. I have
not mentioned people who are physi»
cally handicapped, I have not men4
tioncd those who are of low social
status, those who come from low-
incomebackgrounds. I have notmen-
tioncd the mentally handicapped or
intellectually slow. Multiculturalism
is all those things to which we close
our collective eyes, all the things that
make us turn our heads or simply
pretend not to see. Multiculturalism
is everything else.
