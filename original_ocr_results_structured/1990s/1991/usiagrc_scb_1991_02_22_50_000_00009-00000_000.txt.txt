Dance Instructor added to teach ballet

dance classed at the University of
Iowa through a special program for
gifted and talented junior high

By Louis Saletan

Last Friday, Grinnell students
welcomed Connie Fitzgerald, a
senior dance major at the Univer~
sity of Iowa, as a new edition to
Grinnell’sexuacurricularFineArts
faculty.

In response to demonstrated
student interest in extracurricular
ballet instruction, SGA Vice-
President Deb Koa arranged for
Fitzgerald to teach ballet at Grinnell
on a weekly and perhaps eventually
bi-weckly basis for the rest of the
academic year Since the classes
are offered outside of the set cur-
riculum,participatingstudentsmust
pay a fee for ballet instruction.

Fitzgerald says she is greatly
interested in teaching a variety of
levels of ballet instruction at Grin-
nell, everything from classes for
absolute beginners to classes for
moreadvancedstudentsr Currently
only an intermediate level ballet
class is meeting on Friday after»
noons; however, in response to ad-
ditional student interest and the
more ﬂexible availability of the
danccstudio alter break, changes in
the class meeting times and the
levels of instruction otfcred are
likely.

An Iowa City native, Fitzgerald
began studying dance at a very
young age At age 12, she extended
her dance training by enrolling in

school students. In recent years,
Fitzgerald has spent her summers
studying dance in programs spon-
sored by the Boston Eallet, the
torrrcy Ballet, the Royal Winnipeg
Ballet, and the Interlochen Arts
Academy. She was also a member
of the dance company "Dancers to
Go” at the University of Iowa for
three years.

Rutles Highway Revisited - Various Artists

This album is like a musical hall of mirrors - it is a tribute to a
spoorora rock band. “Rutles Highway Revistted" is made up or
cover versionsofsongs from the ﬁlm “The Rutlcs", which parodied
the Beatles.

Sound interesting? Ithought so, and I even went so far as to
buyit, sadlyenough. Despitean impressive an‘ay oitalent including
Galaxie 500, Daniel Johnston, Bongwater, and Shoncn Knife, this
album is a big flop, The main problem is the songs themselves; most
of them are basically Beatles songs with just enough lyrical and
musical rearrangement to ruin them,

Jonathan Goes Country - Jonathan Richman

Jonathan Richman, formerly of The Modern Lovers, lunges
head ﬁrst into Country music on this CD. Incidentally, Jonathan
will be appearing at Gabe's in Iowa City next Wednesday, so the
applicability of this record review to the lives of Grinncll students
could not be greaterr

The songs are generally good, especially “Reno" which describes
that crazy gambling town. and “Since She Stalled to Ride," which
is a sad and beautiful song about what happens to a woman who
becomes obsessed with horses.

It‘s a decent CD and a nice change of pace for him, although I
can’t imagine anybody butdie hard Jonathan Richman fans getting
incredibly excited about it.
