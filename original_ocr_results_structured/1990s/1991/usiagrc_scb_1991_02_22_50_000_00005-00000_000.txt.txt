Soviet students talk
of domestic crisis

By Sarah Purcell

Grinnell’s eight visiting Soviet
students and their advisor, Profes-
sor Igor Arkhipov. spoke in South
Lounge on Friday, February 15 on
their views of current events in the
Soviet Union. The six women and
two men are the third group of
students from the Herzen Pedar
gogicat and Teacher institute in
Leningrad to spend a semester at
Grinnell,

Arkhipov began the discussion
with his “personal views” of the
“radical changes” taking place in
the Soviet Union today. He said
that because of the govemment’s
“loosening of central controls“
many Sovietsare“confused” about
whattodo with theirnew freedoms.

Arkhipov listed what he saw to
be the benefits of “Perestroika” as
“more political
liberty," “a taste
of freedom,"
“more intema-
tional ex-
changes,“ more
legal opportu-
nity of entre-
prenuers,“ and
“a general sense
of relief." Ale
though he
warned that much of the ”eupho-
ria" is wearing off in the face of
current crises, he cited the very fact
the his students were able to speak
and study at Grinncll as a reason to
thank Gorbachev.

Arkhipov also talked of the
”fallout” of Percstroika which has
been caused mostly by loss of
governmental control over the
economy. He said there is “less
actualfrecdom becauseoffood and
goods shonages," and a “rismg
wave of crime,“ He expressed
concern for thc“civil war going on
in some areas," and the damage
done to community spirit by the
loss ofarl ideological and political
perspective among the people.

To describe the current state or
the USSR Dr. Arkhipov quoting
from Dr. Zhivagu said that it con-
tains an “old life and aing from
which confront each other and do
not overlap.” He added that “Rus-
sia will never disappear because it

"Russia will never
disappear because it is
a very great country,"
which is "very good at

undergoing crises, "

is a very great country.“ which is

“very good at undergoing crises.”

He added tllat the Soviet Union

usterity measures and if“iso-
latlonist views” do not prevail.

Dmitrii Nuridzhanov spoke
about the history of the city of
Leningrad, where the students at-
tend the Henen Institute, He used
the Peter and Paul Fortress tn
Leningrad as a symbol for the pre
andpost revolutionary periods. The
fortress has been a military install-
menl,ajait. aschool forartstocrauc
girls, and was the location from
which Lenin directed his part ofthc
revolution.

Nuridzhanov, who described
himself as a nonrpolitical person.
toldof the controversy over whether
Leningrad should now change its
name back to
St. Peters-
burg,bulsaid:
“Personally i
think it
doesn‘t make
any differ-
ence,” be-
cause “all the
p r o b l e m s
won’t be
gone."

Mikhail Morozov described the
very active political climate in
Leningrad. He said that Leningrad
has traditionally been on the cut-
tingedgeofrtationalpoliticalsenti-
merit and has spawned new parties
and leaders regularly. He called it
“Lhc center of political life in Rus-
sia"

Morozov concentrated on the
many new political parties which
have been founded in Leningrad
over the past eight year, beginning
with the first “illegal" party. the
Democratic Union, founded in
1983. Other recentparties founded
in Leningtad, complete with full
coverage on local television, include
the“memory”conscrvativenation-
alist party. the “New Stalinistic
Party,” and a monarchist party
which is agitating for the return of
a Czar.

Expert speaks on South Africa

Talks of destabilization of neighbor Mozambique

By Rina Khan

TthosenfieldProgram'ssymr
posium on “South Africa in a
ChangingWorldICurrentRealities
and FuturcProspects" began with a
talk on ”Exportng Terror: South
African Dcstttbilization of
Molambique" by Professor Allen
lsaacman.

lsaacmtm is a leading scholar of
Moztitnbiquunpolitics.havingwon
the distinguished Melville J,
Hcrskowiu Award in 1972 for his
publication onAfriCan Studies. Hc
is presently Professor of History
and Director of the MacArthur Inn
tcrdlsciplinary Program on Peace
and Inlcmationul Cooperation at
the University of Minnesota.

lsaacman focused on the policy
ofexponing terrorism and apartheid
policies to front-line countries that
is followed by the South African
government.

Hcdescribed thcnegativcimagc
of black-on-black violence that is
often depicted in the Western press
as only reinforcing the incorrect
stereotype that “the killing that is
going on is only Lribalism." He
stressed that “violence is endemic
and inherent to apartheid."

The state sponsored terrorism
that has devastated Mozambique is

directed against Mozalnbique's cf-
forts to establish a nonmetal soci-
ety, said lsaacman, who described
lhccrisis created by South Africa's
support for the Renamo rebel
movementtohavebcen“extremely
successful" wtlh regards to South
African intentions in the region.
As a result 100,000 Citizens of
Mozambique have been killed and

Mozambique has been
ﬁghting an insurgency
backed by neighboring
South Africa since
independence in 1975.
The ﬁghting has left
thousands dead and
many more homeless.

2.5 million have been left home-
less. Mozambique's distorted
economy and poor state policies
have also contributed to the wide
spread devastation caused by the
South African supported Renatno
rebels.

isaacman described how the
people of Mozambique united un-
derFrelimo in 1962 after titty years
of sustained struggle against Por-
tuguese and South African control,

Although Mozambique gained in
dependence in 1975, it remainedan
economic SatelliteofSouth Africa,
The establishment of a Marxisb
Lcninist government “robbed
people of democratic impulses."
while their state—owncd farm poli~
cics failed, according to Professor
Isaacman.

The Rename rebels are said by
is acmnn to have recruiting pulir
cics that forcibly rip young men
from their communities, making
them botlt “victims and victimiz-

rs " These rcbcls have been suc-
ccssful in destabilizing the country
and cutting Lradcby80%. l-leargucd
that Rename has no base of popular
support and its only objective is to
continue the reign of terror.

Although South Africa has
achieved many of its goals,
Isaacman still holds some hope for
the future. He described the
Mozambique governrﬁent‘s at-
tempts to take account of failed
policies and to begin a vigorous
policy of pursuant peace. He also
stressed tltc Mozambique people‘s
resiliency and the vast resources
that the country is endowed widt.
Ultimately. however, until apartheid
is dismantled. the “future of
Molambique is intn'nsically tied to
the future of South Africa."
