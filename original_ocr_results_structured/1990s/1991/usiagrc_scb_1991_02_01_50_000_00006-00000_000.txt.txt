True Multiculturalism

Staff Editorial

Grinnell has taken greatsteps in
recent years to increase
multicultural awareness. Semi~
annual meetings of the President's
Committee fora Stronger Minority
Presence, as well as input from a
number of student groups, faculty
and adrninisu-ation have resulted in
one prominent theme: to increase
not only the number of people of
color in the faculty and the student
body, but to facilitate an
envtronment which encourages and
integrates multiculturalism
throughout all facets of Grinncll
College.

In some ways, the college has
succeeded in establishing a greater
multicultural presence on campus.
Forexample,accordlngtotheOfflee
of Multicultural Affairs there are
60 African American students, 51
Asian Americans and 20 Latino-
Latinas.

However, one multicultural
group is clearly underrepresenled-
Native Americans. There is one
identi fled Native American student

on campus.

President Drake and the Ofﬁce
of Admissions acknowledge this
absence ofculture, and both agree
that it is Grinnell's environment
which hinders a Substantial Native
American recruitment program.
According to Drake, Grinnell is not
prepared with the necessary
receptive environment for Native
Americans; not only does the
composition of the faculty and staff
lackinrolemodels foraperspecttve
Native American student
community, but there could be a
definant culture shock for some
Native Americans as well.

The Native American interest
group believes that the best way to
remedy this situation is to establish
better relations with local Native
American settlements, They
suggest a program similar to Des
Moines' "iHaveaDream" program.

We agree in order to establish
the multicultural environment
toward which Grinnell is
committed, such an environment
must include all persons of color. A
multiethnic community benefits
everyone. And Gritinell cannot
accurately callitself a multicultural
environment until it involves all
cultures.

CUBIOUSEII AND CUBIOIISEII

The realities of war in the Gulf

Remember what it was
like making decisions when you
wereachild? We hadnotyctlcomed
the dividing mark between emotion
and reason. Asa child the world, no
matter how vast it appeared, could
always be warped to put us and our
personal desires and needs, no
matter how trivial, at the center. It
did not matter how petty our wants
were; the simple fact that we had
them turned them into moral
imperatives. thn the world
seemed to turn to other things forils
center we could stamp our feet and
lcave,and weknew in our heart that
it was the Worlds 1055. So it is with
children: every decision placatcd
on every whim.

With time, things change. We
realize that we are not the center of
ourworld.Theltne between thought
and emotion, which did not exist
before, makes an appearance and
fixesitselfinourminds.Webccome
capable of sacrifice and of lifting
up the heaviest of burdens simply
because our reason dictates the
propriety of the prescribed task. It
is this which truly marks us as adults:

SGA members debate decision

To the editor,

We are VERY disturbed about
the recent Joint Board decision to
support 21 "Disco Week" in the
middle of Black History Month.
This letter is not attacking the
organizers of the "week," hutrulhcr
those belonging to JomtBoard who
votedin favoroftheresolution. We
believe that the week was planned
tosimplyhavefunandnotmeantto
lessen the actvitics of Black History
Month. Joint Board, the elected
"leaders" of the student body of the
college, has approved a resolution
pledging SGA's support for the
week.

February was proclaimed Black
History Month by the college in

The

observation of a national
declarationby the federal
government The activities during
this month that are sponsored by or
in connection with the theme of
Black History Month are
SUPPOSED to be given priority.
TheweckulatlointBoardhasvoled
to designate Disco Wek will have
events during many lectures and
Symposiums dedicated to Black
history. It shows incredible
disrespect toBlack history forJoint
Boardlto feel it has the right or
power to declare a week in
opposition to these events. When

the ability to examine situations
and sometimes come to painful
conclusions about the tasks which
liebeforeus. Sometimes,however,
the decision is so difficult that we
wantnothingmorethantoignoreit.

Soitislsnow.Weasindividuals
and as a nation are forced to pit our
wants and dreams against the
coldest of realities, the reality of
war. Never in my life have I faced
so trying and painful a decision. It
eats at me from morning till night.
pushing me into thoughts that I
would desperately want to ignore.
From all sides people tell me not
only whatI should think, but how I
should think.

Many have said that now
that the War in the Gulf has
begun,tlle time for thought is over.
They claim it is no longer a
philosophical issue, but a reality
about which we can do nothing.
They state that we can no longer
realistically pullout,soweallmust
blindly throw our support behind

the government’s policy. This
notion is false Ifweare to function
as a democracy, we must never
cease to be critical, both of the
government and of ourselves. To
followblindlywouldbea failureof
our responsibilities as citizens of
this nation and a betrayal of the
principles on which itwas founded.
However, to blindly go against the
government, to assume that the
policy is bad simply because of the
administtation or the trend in our
community against the war, is just
as big a violation of our civic duty.
As I look at this war I am torn. I
know the evils of war on both the
emotional and intellectual levels. I
know thewcaponsatworkand their
capacity for destruction, and I am
terrified at the knowledge of their
use. To make this the only basis of
rnydecision,however,istoberuled
by my emotions. Iwouldbeignoring
the lessons othistory and dooming
the world for a repetition of its
mistakes.
Saddam Hussein is indeed
a threat. I do not mean a threat to

Student counters editorial coverage

To the editor,

I was quite surprised when I read
the Scarlet and Black last week. I
was looking forward to seeing a
reporting of student sentiment
toward the war in the Persian Gulf.
I expected the Scarlet and Black to
attempttoreportthewidevarietyof
opinions that exist. Much to my
dismay, however, the Scarlet
undBlack did not do this. There
were two articles related to the
opinion of college students toward
the Gulf War, The first, a frontr
page article by news editor Craig
Wackcr, described the trip of a
Grinncllgrouptoparticipalcinunlir
wardemonstration in Washington
DC. The second told of what
Grinnell Students did over break to

protest the war. Individually,

the articles demonstrated good

oumalism. However, the editorial
staffofthe Scarlet and Block chose
to pt-intonly lhosetwostorics. There
was no discussion of Grinnell
students who are in favor of our
actions in the Persian Gulf. That
kind of imbalance is very poor
joumalismandcouldbeconsidered
blatanteditorialismandbizlstowztrd
news coverage, The editorial
choices oflthcarlet and Black are
particularly curious in lightofthcir
staff editorial. In impassioned
rhetoric, the writers pleaded the
college community to not be
apathetic. We are urged to
understand the crisis and be

informed ofthe issues surrounding
it. I agree with the writers, It is
integral to a democracy for its
members tDbceduCated. However,
the editorial staff must be unafraid
Iofollow theirown wordsandreport
this and any issue in a balanced,
equitable and impartial fashion,
That would do a great deal toward
dispellingtheapathyofthecollege
