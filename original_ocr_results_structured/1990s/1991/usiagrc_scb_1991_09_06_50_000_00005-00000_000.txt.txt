The first impression is a lasting one

Well, here we go again. I never
thought that being a senior Ill
Grinnell would {ml so much like it
didln high schoolz'l'his islny home
turf, and the new students coming
into it suddenly seem very young.

This year's “fresh” class also
seems particularly eager. These StuA
dents will ask questions, join comr
mittees and fight for class discus-
Sion time, I’m glad. I have two
pieces of advice for incoming
Grinnellians. One: Lot The Specia-
lar speak for itself. Two: Don’t
underestimate the importance of the
choice of our new college presi-
dent, Pamela Ferguson.

As soon as I found out about the
scheduled student forums with the
three final candidates last spring. I
put them on my calendar. Natur
rally, I was thrilled to discover that
one of them was a woman, but I
vowed to reserve my judgment un—
tilaftertheforumsltried to picuire
the kind of woman who would ap—
ply and be seriously considered for
such an influential position. I guess
I was expecting someone who
would make compromising state-
ments, give politically advanta-
geous answers. and generally do
what was expected of her.

When Pamela Ferguson walked
into South Lounge and introduced

Alanna
Walen

herself, my expectations disinte-
grated. She refused to hide bcllind
the podium, speaking from acasual
standing position not far from the
front row. One hand on her hip,
fully aware of her height and pros-
encc. she answered questions hone
estly andconvinctngly.Dtlring that
session, and in the few timesl have
heard her speak since then, she
madeitperfectlyclearthatthequat
ity education ofGrinnell students is
her mission, and all other consider-
ations fall somewhere below that
unmistakable priority.

I was ecstatic when Ileamed that
shehad been chosen by the trustees
as the next president, Though I had
decided she would be the best
choice, I thought it would be too
good to be true. I could attribute
some of my excitement to the fact
tliattliis was approximately the sec—
ond time I have rooted for a candi-
date foranything whoactually won.
I realized early this year that I re-
lived that excitement every Lime 1
saw her around town or heard of her
scheduled appearance at an ofﬁcial
function, and I think I have deter-

mined the reason for this.

I have learned to question our
society to such an extent that I
don’t believe iii the leaders of thc
world, the country, or even the
Stale in which I live I’m not ready
to throw them out, because I'm not
sure anyone else could do much
better. But I don't tntst them to
make decisions that I would sup
port or that always take the com-
mon good into consideration,

I am astonished, therefore, to
find that I have total faith in PreSi-
dcnt Ferguson. 1 don't think shc's
an antiestztblishment rebel, I don't
expect her to refuse to wear high
heels, or join PAPA ataproechnice
rally, or to tell the trustees to jump
in a lake ifshe disagrees with them.
But I do expect her to know, in
many cases, whatwouldbethebest
course of action for improving the
educational and social community
here, and to take every possible
step toward attaining that goal.

And that faith stands out in my
mind,partly becauseot its glaring
uniquenessinmy viewoftheworld,
and partly because of the comfort it
gives me, knowing that the school
will be in good hands after my
class and I leave next spring

 

DINOSAUR DAYS
Farewell to summer

The geese are ﬂying south again
I close my eyes to the sight and
hope that the sky might be dotted
with some quickly moving rain
clouds; even acid rain would be
more welcome to my vision titan
this undeniable hint at the coming
season. My family in particular
dreads the end of summer, for it
marks migrating time for us, too.
Unlike the geese, we arenot travel-
ing to warmer climates, Nor are we
able to simplyliftourwings and ﬂy
away, Not quite. Rather less grace-
fully, I’m afraid, we mustcram the
Subaru with blankets which were
never used and old tennis balls that
roll around, entenaining the dog
and irritating the driver.

The happy-go-lucky tenor of my
farnily is sorely tested when mov-
ing day arrives. My dad willsurvey
the house, and no matter what is in
it—whether there are filled boxes
neatly placed by the front door or a
pile of dirty laundry in the middle
of the ﬂoor-- he’ll declare, “We’re
looking ata good six to eight hours
here,peoplc.” A scientistwho truly
believes that one should use mea—
suring tools to packaear, he’ll look
on in honor as the rest of us
nonchalantly toss silverware, tooth-
bmshes,shoe polish and towels in a
paperbagi This summer, my mother
and brother Ethan left a week be
fore my father and I. The plan that
two trips would ease the stress of

moving was admirable but whcn I
woke to the familiar strains of my
father humming “Dreaming" and
my brother chiming in with the
RinglingBmther'sandBarnum and
Bailey Circus theme, I knew it
would just be one of those days.
We have a dog, Wally, who is
about the size ofa dinosaur and as
stupid as one, too. He was at the
center of the day’s trauma. Wally
hopped in and balanced delicately
asanelephantonalolletseat.While
the rest of us tried not to laugh,

Mom begged him to scrunch into a
ball. Poor Wally. Ethan was the
ﬁrst to lose his cool and once he
started, the gig was up. After all, a
hacking summer cough is about as
commonasapeaceiui moving day.
Our mirth did not extend to Mom,
who playstheovctcoming—aIl-hard-
shipsinthe-face-otadvcrsity role
(or has,more appmpl'iatcly,a“damn
you all" attitude) in these situa
tions, she angrily shoved Wally’s
head down and slammed the door
as he began to look up. BOIZNK.
“0h, Wally! Are you allrightboy?"
my brother immediately cried out,
pushing my mom aside to release

THE REAL WORLD

Once upon a time
in America

According to Arthur Krupp, the
president ofPeoplc for the Ameri-
can Way, the 1990-91 school year
setancw record for attempted book-
banning in schools, 229 cases of
attempted restriction came up, mak
ing figures 20 percent higher than
thoseoflastycar. Many ofthebooks
that drew the most fire were selec-
tions fromAnderSon’sand Grimms'
books of fairy tales.

Thank God, we're ﬁnally direct-
ing our energy where we need it.

Well, it‘s about time people
started getting hip to the truth.
America is going the way of an
cient Rome faster titan a speaker
goes through Iceland in January.
and finally people are starting to
see where the root of the problem
really lies.

Drug abuse, domestic violence,
rape, racism, turning away from
traditional religious values and
moral nonns——it'sailhappeningev—
ery day. around the clock. In every
neighborhood, some kids inevitar
bly tum bad Why? What causes
normal young minds to warp into
hardened criminal thought?

It’s got to be the fairy tales.

Forget about Catcher in the Rye.
Never mind Slaughter Home Five.
Lord of the Flie:--peanut.s. The
really dangerous corrupiive litera-
ture is the stuff that gets innocently
planted in the minds of America's
youth every day» those piles ofpor-
nography and subversion masquer-
ading under the genre of fairy tales

Finally, decent. upstanding citi
zens have had the courage to band
together and say, “Now look here!
I don’t want my children reading
Snow White mtdlheSeveri Dwarve:
or Little Red Riding Hood! Snow
White’s living with (andtllatrneans
sleeping with, of course, unless
they're up dancing and smoking
dope 24 hours a day) seven male
physical freaks, and little Red is
carrying a bottle of wine around in
her basket! [don’t want my kids to
be reading about bizarre group sex
or Gallo-toting juvenile delin-
quents! Come on- kids can pick up
on stuff like that!"

And insurmountable evidence
combined withbasiccommon sense
proves that without question, chil-
dren do. Goldilocks broke into a
private home and got a good meal
and her pick of an assortment of
furniturerrwhatdoes that say topo-
tential young house-breakers? Any
streetpunk who‘sever stolenan
or a tenespeed probably had the
acceptability of tltievery reinforced
by the carrot-nibbling antics of Pe-
Ier Rabbit, running wild in the in-
nocent Farmer MacGregor‘s gare
den rows.

Our Ame-lean society is being
rent asunder by seemingly inno-
cent stories that fill our children’s
minds with ﬁlﬂt.WllatCallany good
redrblooded American do in de-
fense? Sure, onecan always try to
petition the schools and hassle the
libraries

Don‘t limit the purge to burning
and banning only the obviously of-
fensive ones-let's just torch all ex-
isting pt-intedmaterial, Let'shavea
veritable orgyofFarenhziMSl pro—
portions and warm ourselves in the
golden glow of the burning prod-
ucts of an overabundance of leisure
time and twisted imaginations. And
thus united, as we watch the sun set
on the sorcalled “Age of Reason",
we Americans will be able to stand
shoulder to shoulder, morally in-
tact and mentally stable, applaud-
ing our own intelligence and toss-
ing our reading glasses into the
Grand Canyon. Crime will cease to
be a reality for ourselves and our
children, and video rental prices
will undoubtedly plummet

Andjust think--wili10utWalden's
and Kroch‘s and Brentano's soak-
ing up our hard-eamed dollars. for
the ﬁrst time ever in the history of
this nationwemny actually achieve
the longedesired, ultimate pinnacle
of equality,

All of America will probably be
able to afford to tune in to cable.
