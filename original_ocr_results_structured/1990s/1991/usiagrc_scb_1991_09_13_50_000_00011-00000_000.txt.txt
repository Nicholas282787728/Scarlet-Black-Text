Cross Country women display

cohesion in opening meet

By Terra Geiger

Heterogeneity and inexperience are
not the first words that come to mind
in relation to the phrase “successful
team." Howevemhe women‘s cross
country team may be well on its Way
to makingthe the terms and the phrase
synonymous

This year‘s team isa strong thirty in
number. It is a mixture of seasoned
upperclassmen,fitst year studentswith
significant experience,and manynov-
ice runners.

In spite of theteam's relative incx-
perience, the season looks promisrng
for thePioneers.

According to Coach Evelyn Free-
man, “The team already seems to
bccomingtogetherasacohesive unit".

This cohesiveness showed at the
Pioneers’ first meet last weekend at
the Ramrun XC Invite atComell Coir
lege.

AlthoughWartburg ran away with
first place at the meet sconng only
sixteen points, the Grinnell team [in
ished in a tie for second with Loras at

96 points.

Six Pioneer runners finished in
the topthird of the field and two oth»
ers finished just behind them.

Top runners for the team were

"I see inexperience as
a strength as many on
the team are already

times, yet] know there
is a lot of potential for
improvement. "

Derrickson, senior Nancy Kaiser,
and first-year Rommany
Chanthavong whofimshed 12th, l7lh,
19th, 23rd, 32nd, 33rd, 34th and 361h
respectively.

Freeman said she was pleased that

all of the runners went out aggres-
sively and that there were no big gaps
between the top ninners. ”We have a
really strong nucleus ofeightofnine
runners," stated Freeman.

Freeman pointed to the race as
indicative of how her team‘s inexpe-
rience should not be perceived as a
weakness.

She said, “I see inexperience as a
strength, as many on the team are
already mnning competitive times,
yet] know there is a lot of potential
for improvement."

The depth of the women‘s cross»
country team is expected to
culminate in a successful win/loss
record. But the team is not
focusing on winning right now.

“We are focusing now on trainr
ing—not on meets. Tomorrow will
take care of itself. It is Ute nature of
the sportrthetmponantmeets arenot
until the end of the season. Each
week is merely a building block for
the next. I could not possibly make a
prediction about how the end of the
season will turn out." said Freeman.

“Coming in at half time. we
were in good shape to win the
game," said Head Coach Greg
Wallace.

Unfortunately, the Pioneers
ran into trouble at the beginning
of the second half when Lake
Forest scored on their first two
possessions to open up a fifteen
pointleadandputthegameoutof
reach.

The Pioneers started two
drives deep in their own territory,
and were then forced to punt,
providing the Foresters excellent
opportunities to score. Accord-
ing to Wallace. the lack of favor-
able ﬁeld position “was a cntcial
factor in the second half.“

Linebackers Art Lopez and
Lee Ktaemer spearheaded the
defensive effort for Grinnell.
However, the Pioneers were uni
able to force any turnovers. “One
thing we have to do to win,"
commented Wallace.“is to sim»
ply create more turnovers.”
