9 ya gonna do?

By Eric Bucks
and Sam Dilorio

It’s Parents' Weekend. What are
I mean, you’ve just
gone to dinner with your folks, and
you guess that was kinda cool, but
you’d really rather they went back to
the hotel room. And slept. Because
they are boring. It’s not like having
them come down and buy you
sweatshirts isn’ta hootand a half, but
when it comes to weekend leisure

, ttme, those trips to the Amana Color

niesjustdon‘tcutitonaFridaynight.

So, like the typical Grinnell stu-
dent, you want to get rid of them so
you can shoot some smack and beat
upkids from town (haha). Butthose
folks of yours just won‘t leave. Not
that that’s bad, but who wants to
share? Face it, they eramp your style.

So you decide to alienate them.
Sure, haul ‘em off to Harris, let them

' listen to“therock-‘n‘-rollband.”and

in a few minutes that Super 8 room
won’t seem all thatbad. lmean.they
got cable there. Continental break—
fast, too.

But that plan might not work this
Parents' Weekend, because the band
in Harris, Monks of Doom. is THE
NICEST BAND EVER, and your
folks mightjuststiek around. Monks
of Doom aren‘t nice in a cuddly way.
although their promo picture might
convince you otherwise. But nice in
a genuine. sincere, 905 kind of way.

Yeah. this Friday evening at
10:00, Monks of Doom will be
bringing their bag ofmusical tricks to
campus. Monks of Who? Legion of
What?,yousay. Maybeyou’veheard
of the Ophelias? Maybe you’ve
heard of Camper Van Beethoven?
Well, here’s the story.

Monks of Doom are three-fifths
(that’s 60%) of college rock faves
Camper and one»fourth (that’s 257
aw, skip it) of West Coast legends

The Ophelias. Monks started out as
a side project but after Camper and
the Ophs (as they are affectionately
known) called it a day. the Monks
rose from their ashes like an amiable
phoenix.

The Monks are tight. Musically
tight. Tighter than the ofﬁce of Fi-
nancialAid even. They sound a little
like Camper Van did, but they’ve
cashed in the violin for a more enerr
getic, heads—up sound. And do these
boys serve up a heapin’ helpin' of
tempo changes, climactic interludes,
and jazz riffs! We get giddy just
thinkin‘ about it,

And unlike some bands, the
Monks ofDoom will probably be too
busy stitchin’ togethcrtheir own sonic
patchwork to do anything to really
piss offyour parents. And talk about
nice! If past shows are any indica—
tion, your folks would probably rather
have those Doom guys over for din-
ner than some of your friends. People
who’ve seen the band tell us they’rea
far cry from jaded rock snobs.

Sophomore Ken Viste talked of
sharing a beer. or rather“a good beer,
Augsburger!” with the bassist after a
show. Yet another person recalled
how the band gave away their instru-
ments to anybody who asked. Well,
anyone who asked politely.

And it's not like opening act
Soutltem Culture On the Skids won’t
be giving itall they’ve gotmusically,
too. The three-piece SCOtS have
been slow-cookin’ their “beerrswill-
ing, string-twangin’ delight" long
enough to release two albums. and a
mess-abeans. Their latest LP, Too
Much Park For JILSI One Fork, is a
16~song, bluesy, barefoot stomp
through the mud. Surf music for
farmers’ kids, if you will. With a
wider audience appeal than some
college bands, the Skids headlined
an 1989 tour of North Carolina pris-
ons.

And, according to theirpromo kit,

they’ve been known to invite fans to
dance on stage while waving fried
chicken. Yeah, like that won‘t be
enough to scare your parents back to
the motel.

New Jack City stilted yet forceful

By Rhys Jones

New Jack City starts ferociously,
withoneof the best chasc scenes ever
seen on film. Whether it was the in»
ventive camera angles or the driving
music in the background, director
Mario Van Peebles more than proves
he can make an action scene work.

Unfortunately, the entire movie
cannot be comprised of chase scenes.
Though Ice T, Wesley Snips, and
Bill Nunn make valiant efforts, the
dialogue in Newlack City is forced,
and the dramatic scenes sometimes
seem almost comedic. Stock charac-
ters abound, and although this film
certainly breaks away from the aver-
age gangster movie, it has every cli—
ched police situation one can imag-
tne.

The drama isn’t all bad, however.

The luxurious lifeofNunio Brown is
well-depicted, and his sudden out~
breaks of temper and violence are
handledquitewell. Even Bill Nunn,
perhaps the weakest actor in the
movie. proves his acting prowess
during the striking crack withdrawal
scenes. His tears and pain are pal»
pable, and his torturous desire to use
crack can be truly felt by the viewer.

For all its dramatic faults, New
Jack City is an undeniably good
film. Itisinerediblyexcitingandfun
to watch, and although one’s eyes
can become glazed from the constant
gunﬁre, the action almost never
stops. Plot twists abound and inter-
est is held by a sort of morbid fasci-
nation with the grimy underside of
New York. New Jack City wil be
shown on Friday at 7:30 and Sunday
at 3:00 in Harris Cinema.

Alice in Allen's Manhattanland

By Louise Alcom

Released earlier this year,AIice is
the latest Woody Allen/Mia Fat-row
showcase.

This ﬁlm is a fantasy, pure and
simple. But with Allen's penchant
forsocial commentary, it couldn’t be
all THATsimple. The rich, idle Alice
has a thing about Mother Teresa that
causes her noend of angst. This angst
eventually takes her to a herbalist of
questionable ethics. From there,
