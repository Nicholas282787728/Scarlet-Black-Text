resolution by SGA offended many
Grinncll students, African and Afr
rican American students were par-
ticularly offended because of the
disco week’s interference with
Black History Month. The general
tone of Disco week also offended
many students. some of whom saw
itas a directmockery ofConcometl

History Month.

Marie Myers. spokesperson for
CBS. said that she was “spcoclts

that the approval by SGA of the
resolution “really hurt." The next

The vole was 24 in favor ofhalling
the party. and ﬁve opposed.

Myers said thathalting the party
was “not a punishment for the
Grinnell Studenl body." She rein-
forced the idea that there was noth»

dance some students witnessed
during the party waspartofa South
African dance meant lo raise the
spirits of those involved.

Myers also said that the general
nature of Disco week put down

Curriculum Committee submits proposal

By Kim Eckart

The Curriculum Review Come
mittec submitted its final report to
the faculty last week on a proposal
for required. interdisciplinary se-
nior seminars.

Although the faculty will not
Ionnally discuss the proposal until
President-elect Pamela Ferguson
assumes hcrposilion later this year,
the plan may be implemented on a
trial basis forthe 1991 -92 academic
year. The proposal outlines a pro-

gram forsenior seminars which pro-
vide a “capstone" to a liberal arts
education and aim to emphasize the
student‘s non-major course work.
According to the proposal. the
seminars should “intensify the sc-
nlor year experience” and increase
the effectiveness of courses taken
outside of the student’s major field.
The topics, therefore. would com-
bine several issuesand disciplines—
similarto the topicsoffered as fresh-
man tutorials. “This gives the work
outsidelhemajormoreimportancc,"

sztid A] Jones, professor of history
and member of the Curriculum
Review Committee. “The senior
year and the work outside themajor
coulduscalittlcmorestructurc.but
this shows that we don't need a
batlcry of requirements to provide
that structure."

According to Faculty Chair
Chuck Jepsen. the current interdis—
ciplinary concentration seminars
