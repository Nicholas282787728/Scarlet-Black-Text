ICOMMON SENSE

THROUGH THE
DRINKING GLASS

ENot all Conservatives support Bush

A Writing in the Scarlet and Black
’ for September 20. Jordan Magill dc—
nounced “Nechonscrvativcs, like
*my fellow commentator Mike
YWashbum,” who “pray at George
Bush’s altar and deﬁne themselves
“through support of his every wor ."
A Itis easy to see why Magill thinks
that I am a fanatical supporter of
Bush After Bush invited Nelson
'Mandela to the White House, I wrote
,“TheANCvs.Freedom,”whichchar-
acterized Mandela as a Communist
’andaterroristwhodidnotdeservethe
yhonors he had received.

Consonant with his fetish for

Gorbachev, Bush failed to forcefully
’oppose Moscow 5 suppression of the
‘Lithuanian independence movement,

Last month I published an article in
‘my newspaper castigating Bush‘s
Lacquiescence in Communist imperi-

alism.
A I have also editorially denounced
ItheNational EndowmentfortheArLs,
‘ toward which Bush is friendly.

Yes, myjoumalism is clearly the
'workof someone whoprays atBush’s
aaltar.

An editorial in The Nation, ajour-

naloftheradtcal left sighs that“four
lmore years of Bush" are a “depress-
.ingprospect.”Icouldnotagrecmore.

Nor am I alone. Most people who are
-eonservative in more than justa nomi-
znal sense hate Bush as much as his

left-wing enemies.

Mike
Washburn

Inourview, his economicperfor»
mance hasbeen miserable.Underthis
conservative" president, federal
spending as a share of gross national
product has not decreased but risen
from 22.3% to 25%. Far from being
devoted to the conservative principle
oflimited government, Bush is quite
comfortable with our slide into so
cialist mire.

Favorably disposed toward an
NEA which subsidized Piss Christ.
Bush accused its conservative critics
of supporting“censorship."TheCon-
scrvatives responded that if Andres
Serrano wants to urinate in ajar and
submerge acrucifix, he is welcome to
do So~but taxpayers should have no
obligation to pay him for it.

Supporting our buildup in Saudi
Arabia in a speech a year ago, Bush
argued that the US. should work to
bring about a “New World Order,"
This fine phrase denotes a utoptan
vision in which Washington presides
overapeacefulintemationalcommu-
nity. Conservatives (the real ones)
are skeptical ofutopian visions. They
think that the world is too rife with
fanaticism and intractable confl ictf or
there to be a “New World Order"
anytime soon. America’s most vis-

ibleConservative,Patrick Buchanan,
opposed going to war, arguing that
now that the only real threat to
America, communism, is defeated.
America should practice isolation-
ism and worry about its own ills.
(Buchanan put himself behind the
U.S. when the ground war started.)

Magill labels “Neo-Conserva-
Lives” as “Gestapo Conservatives,”
linking me to Hitler’s thugs. Jordan,
you have hit a new nadir, equating
your political opponents with fas—
cists.l thought you wereabove cheap
smear tactics. why, in a column last
semester you yourself criticized
Grinnell students for bludgeoning
theiropponents with labels instead of
arguing. Moreover. I thought that
someone who professes knowledge
ofmodem politics would never assor
ciate a doctrine which proclaims the
omnipotence of the state with a doc
trine which posits that the power of
the state must be strictly limited.

I do find your fulminations about
OliverNorth'sillegalbehavioramus
ing. After all, you have defended the
Israeli occupation of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, which. whether right
or wrong, ismore divorced from legal
process than anything Oliver North
has done.

A final word about North. Let us
remember that the man was not act»

Here it isﬁanother bitching. bit-
ing, cynical, satirical column on the
banalities of Grinnell life. So what’s
this week’s topic? Music and openr
mindedness.

It doesn't exist here.

Golly, that’s an awfully short col-
umn, Maybe I should explain myself
further.

I'm ajunior. I've beenhereawhile.
I’ve seen a lot of parties, both in
Harris and in the now-extinct-but—
legendary Gardner. Of all these par-
ties. I drink only three of them fea~
lured something other than dance
music. (This does not include con-
Certsibut I'll get to that later.)

Now, this is not meant to be a put
down of dance musrc, I like dance
music. (Not that you could tell by my
cd collection, but I do. Really.) But]
also like some metal, some progres
sive (however you define it). some
mellow stuff, some classic rock, and
some stuff that even Morn artd Dad
can listen to. I like dance music: I’m
just tired of it.

I’m also tired of the repetition.
Part of our problem is people’s un-
willingness to listen to things that
they don’t already know. Well,
newsflash—we’re in the middle of
Iowa,andwedon’texaetlyhaveahot
connection to new music. So, what
happens is, we end up hearing the
same songs over and over and over.

 

jFRIENDLY FIRE

:September, come she will

i September is justa lousy month,
and I’m anxious to get it behind me.
"I'herc is no way to avoid this plain
and simple fact. It is an in-between
‘month. not quite as rich and alive like
summer in August. and not quite into
1 the beauty of autumn in October. You
‘think of September, and you think
”back to school” sales, and you know
‘that after a month in school you’ve
‘been there too long. The weather is
unpredictableﬁfluctuating from In
‘diansummertokillerfrosts.Theparka
.artd mittens you wore to your 8: 00,
are sweat- soaked when you walk
home from your 11: 00
. Everything begins to die in Sep-
Itember, aswell. Nothingactually line
ishes dying until later in the year,
- however it is clear in September that
cenain elements of this world are in
’ the throes of death. This includes the
flowers, trees, honey bees, summer
romances,your favoritebaseballteam
(near the bitter end), your favorite
‘football team (which, although the
.outcome is inevilable, won’t punch
out until sometime in late Deceme
)ber), Paul Tsongas’ snowball in a
sauna’s chance of becoming the
Democratic sacriﬁcial lamb, Fidel
Castro, everyone's (save the staff of
A theSpectator) dream that Dan Quayle
‘ will honorably step down, and civil
libertarians hope thatSupremeCourt
”nominee Clarence Thomas will get

Josh Ford

"Borked."

Included in that list could also be
the Soviet Union. but no one is totally
sure if it is completely dead. Ampuv
tated for cenain. Diminished in per-
ception far more than we can ever
diminish Michael Dukakis, for sure.
But dead or even dying? At the very
least most of the republics will be
attending the Olympics together if

How many times can I hear
‘ThingsThatMakeYouGol-lmmm?"
before Isiah the dj? How many times
can I hear “Been Caught Stealing"
before I burn my Jane’s Addiction
discs in disgust? (Memo to lane’s
“fans”: They have recorded other
songs. Check them out. They don‘t
feature a barking dog. but they’re
pretty darn cool anyway.)

I know I’m bitching, but [just
want people to know that you don’t
have to dance at every party. I don’t
think the ﬁrst parties were organized
to let people sweat like pigs while
gyrating their bodies to a synthesized
beat.

NEANDERTl-IAL 1: What a
crappy week. Ireally need toblowoff

not the Parliament, so perhaps the
“evil empire” will live on in themani~
festation of theRussian hockey team.

The comment about the current
nominee to theSupremeCourtserves
to remind us of what an extraordinar-
ily lousy September this has been. It
seems more and more likely that his
nomination will pass theSenate,send-
ing to the highest court in the land a
justice who may serve until the year

see FORD page 10

Groove is in the pit (of hell)

some steam.

NEANDERTHALZ: Me too. Let's
put on some dance tunes and sweat
like pigs.

Well, maybe, but I doubt iL

or hell, a country and western party.
People listen to these types of music.
Sowhatif“themajority”prefets dance
music? Let’s starta new trend: Toler~
once. I have plenty of friends who
don’t like dance music. What are you
going to tell them? Well, sorry thatall
youractivity-fee moneyisbeing spent
on parties that you really don’t much
care for, but hey, everyone else is

The problem is very basic: A)

Elisa
Martin

Every HAC or party planner wants
his/her party to be the best ever; and
B) Somewhere, someone got theidea
that a party is only successful if a
whole lot of people show up. Ergo,
HACs and others play this dance
music that the majority likes. (Can
you tell I took Logic?) Yeah, this
syllogism works,butthis doesn’t have
to be true.

I worked my butt off last year to
throw a funk party."‘A Turik pany,” I
thought “Now there’s something I
haven’t seen! By golly. that wouldbe
really fun. A good time for all."
Wrong. When my friends and I went
collecting. you wouldn‘tbelieve how
many people whined, “A FUNK
party? But I don’t like funk." Hey, I
don’t care if you don’t want to open
your pocketbook to every party that
comes collecting, but why don’t you
open your mind just a tad?

Alas, I fear my fondest dreams of
open-mindedness will never see the
light of reality, so my only reprieve
comes in the form of concerts. For
those of you who whine about the
