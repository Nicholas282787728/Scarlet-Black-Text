Norris Lounge damage
prompts arson charges

By Steve Clem

Damage to lounge f umiture and a
small fircinNorrisloungclastFriday
evening prompted Dean of Student
Affairs Torn Crady to file arson
charges with the Grinncll Police Doe
partment this week.

Somctimc on Fndny evening, an
unknown suspect damaged a piece of
furniture and a poster on the lounge
wall was set on ﬁre according to
Crady.

Crady was notified by a night
watchman late Friday evening, and
visited the lounge on Saturday mom~
ing. ”When I visited the lounge on
Saturday morning, I immediately
notified the police as soon as asign of
a small ﬁre was evident," said Crady.

Cmdy stressed that he was prima-
rily concerned with the possible dan»
ger ofa larger fire in his call to the
police, “Normally I don’t call the
police, but the threat to life or safety
on campus was too great. My con—
cern is that anyone who plays with
ﬁre places anyone in the dorm in
danger," said Crady.

Scrgcont Larry Bush of the Grins
neII Police Department, the ofﬁcer
who responded to Crady’s call on
Saturday morning, said that the in-
vestigation was still in the prelimi-
nary stages. “Right now we arcjust
attempting to conclude who set the
posteron fire,"saidBush. Bushwould
likc zmyonc with any information on
the case to contact Student Affairs or
the policcin order for it tobercsolved
more easily.

Crady confirmed that two other
incidents of pieces of paper being lit
on ﬁre have been reported to Student
Affairs. Crady reponed that the po-
lice had been notiﬁed in one of those
two fires as well.

“I would think that the students
would be more concerned with ﬁres
after the Cleveland Hall fire this se~
mcster," said Crady.

Crady added that he will continue
to visit the dormitories to visit with
students in reaction to the growing
number of vandalism incidents, such
as the ﬁre and the recent appearance
of swastikas on the doors of various
student rooms.

Christian lectures on
Morrison’s novel Beloved

By Ann Treistman

Barbara Christian is a fragile look-
ing womanr Due to a hip injury, she
usadacanetowalkuptothepodium
on Tuesday nightfor hertalk on Toni
Morrison‘sBelaved: Ancestral War-
ship. When Christian, Professor of
Ethnic Studies at the University of
Califomia. Berkeley, spoke however,
her voice entranced the audience with
its strength, conviction, and knowl-
edge.

Christian discussed the ancestral
perception of Morrison's novel. She
talked about the “middle passage" —
me time when the slaves were taken
from their homeland of Africa to be-
come slaves. One never heats of the
50 million slaves who died during
that passage, said Christian. In her
novel, Morrison ﬁnally remembers
these people through “ancestral wor-
ship."Beloved,the daughterwho was
killed by her slave mothcras a means
of protection, represents the 60 mil-
lion slavcs who were “left without a
name, who are not remembered."
Christian connects this image of a
motherbeing sepamted from herchild
with that of the slaves being sepa-
mted from their “mother-land."

Beloved is based on the story of
Margaret Garner, a slave who killed
her children in order that they would
not become slaves themselves. In the
novel, Selhc‘s daughter (called Be-
loved from the inscription on her
gravestone) returns from what Chns-
tian claims can only be the “middle
passage." In this way, Morrison’s
characters are forced to dcal with
what happened to those 60 million
slaves. On another level. Christian
explained that while Morrison could
understand why a mother would “kill

for love," she was concerned with
exploring whether or not a mother
has that righL

Christian‘s interpretation of the
novel was still extremelypertinentas
she drew contemporary issues into
her explication. Morrison deals with
the role of a woman in society; spe—
ciﬁcally with the struggle of a black
slavewoman.Womentodayarcstrug-
gling with the same issues, Christian
argued

The role of mother is one which
cannot be exaggerated. “It is an es-
sential role," said Christian in an in-
terviewt “Without it. we [Afro-Ameri-
cans] would not have survived." This
responsibility to “continue the race"
has dominated black women's con
cern of self. AccordingtoChnstizn,it
is very difﬁcult to be concerned with
a self“within the demands ofaracist
and sexist societyr"

She cited Morrison‘s quote that
black women have to be “both the
ship and the harbor“ indiscussing the
conﬂictbctween selﬁshness andself-
help which black feminists encoune
ter. “We need to be situated in a
community — to critique itand chal-
lenge it e but still be in it," said
Christian. Withoutaspace to develop.
self-help is pointless.

Christian saw two major problems
with regard to the modern feminist
movement. FirSL argued Christian,
“It’s not enough to say ‘be autono-
mous’ if you don't have society (to
back you up)...Women today try to
be ‘Superwomen.’ doing everything
because there is no help (child carc
programs, heath care programs)
offered. They are expected to do it
all." In this situation, shc said,a
