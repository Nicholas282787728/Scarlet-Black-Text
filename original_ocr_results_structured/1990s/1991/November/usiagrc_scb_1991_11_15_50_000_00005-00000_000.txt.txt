Group pushes for alternatives
to animal experimentation

By Karen Nutter

The Animal Rights Coal
(ARC) believes that mandatory ani-
mal labs are keeping them from en-
joying their full academic freedom.
Emphasizing the controversies they
see within the departmenu, they ade
vocate alternatives to the traditional
animal labs, so that students who find
animalexperimentation unethicalwill
not be excluded from taking the
classes they wish to take

Not all students who advocate al-
ternatives are op-

two years ago, which 200 students
signed to show their support.

Even though these numbers show
wide—spread support for the cause,
Hollingswonh questioned whether or
not they should really even beconsid-
ered imponant, stating that even if
only a few people feel restricted, al-
tematives should be provided

“What is the issue?"she demanded.
“Are sheer numbers more important
than individuals? They don'tneed 50
million people knocking atthcirdoor."

have been faced with what they con-
sider to be unethical practices in biol-
ogy and psychology experiments.

For some, it has been the use of
rats in thelntro Psychology labs; why
. they ask, should a rat be bred and
then discarded to prove an experi-
ment found in every intro»level psye
chology book? For others, it was the
mistreatmentofclamsandgoldfishin
biology labs.

“If biology is about life," ARC
mem ber Tamara Ooms reasoned,
“then we should respect that“ What»
ever the reason, all have sought alter-
natives to the practices which they
found offensive and view the lack of
alternative procedures as their main
concern.

Students whohave found lab prac-
tices to be unethical said they have
talked to professors. However, all
were told that no alternatives to ani-
mal labs were acceptable in both the
psychology and biology departments.
Students who did not wish to partici-
pate in labs for moral reasons could
either take a failing grade for the labs
not completed or take the course at a
college or university which did not
have mandatory animal labs. Neither
option was acceptable to the studen Is.

“[That policy] does not allow you
to study psychology. [If you object to
the labs] you have to fail the labs,”
said ARC member Chris Kaestle. As
ARC memberlen Kupinse remarked,
“No one should be excluded from
education."

“I can understand why it wouldbe
difficult to give legitimacy to some-
one who's saying what you‘re doing
is immoral," Kaestle said. “[But] this
is an ethics question, a philosophy
question, not an emotional questionr"

ARC members believe there is
certainly support on campus for the
students who are requesting altemae
tives to the animallabs. Quoting from
a random sampling survey taken two
years ago by a psychology major op~
posed to animal research, ARC meme
berJ en Hollingsworthstated thatover
80 percent of those surveyed sup-
ported alternatives for students more
ally opposed to such experimenu as
rat labs and biology dissections.

Hollingsworth also pointed to a
petition for alternatives, circulated

Mouse Thyroid Gland to Frog Sciatic
Nerve to Mindlab, a psychology pro—
gram. Thestudents arealso willing to
do lab reports based upon research
already collected on the experiment
or other projects not involved with
what they consider to be unethical.

Noun program encourages Women’s Studies

By Alison Wade

For Mary Lynn Broe, last
semester‘s student-initiated confer;
ence on “New Directions in Femi-
nism" represented personal success.

“You know a program has really
taken hold when students are able to
initiate this kind of conference," she
said.

Chair of Grinnell‘s LouiseR. Noun
Program in Women‘s Studies since
its founding in 1986,13roe has been a
primaryinfluencein the development
of this Women’s Studies program.
Broe has seen a real need for the
program, which was created “for the
purposes of transfonning thecurricu-
lum bybringing in women‘s studies."

“There’s a real need for this pro-
gram, quite frankly. I’ve seen that
Grinnell is a very traditional liberal
arts educational system and has
needed to understand various aspects
of feminism,” she said.

In the past, the program has ad-
dressed women's issues in the form
of sponsoring or co-sponsoring cone
ferences, founding the Noun
Women's Studies Colloquium, es-
tablishing the Noon Time Forum, in
creasing the diversity of courses of

Passing by Harry Hopkins House
or Hallie Flanagan Theater.
Grinnellians are reminded of the im-
ponant contributions these alumni
made to national life.

What were distinguished alumni,
such as Harry Hopkins, Hallie
Flanagan and Herbie Hancock. like
during their days here as students?
Did the “Grinnell Experience” inilur
encc thefameofour noted graduates?

Harry Hopkins

Harry Hopkins, director of the
Works Progress Administration
(WPA) and Franklin Roosevelt's
close adviser, wasa very wellerounded
student while at Grinnell. Many of
Hopkins' future interests and achieve
ments are, in fact. represented in his
days at Grinnell.

Entering the collegcafter graduat-
ing from Grinnell High School,
Hopkins took full advantage of the
liberal arts education. He majored in
both history andpoliticalscience,and
he availed himself of many extra—
curricular opportunities before gradue
ating in 1912.

Hopkins was involved with cam-
pus joumalism as a member of the
Cyclone staff and as an editor of the
Scarlet amiBlack. He tested his lead-
ership skills as Sophomore Class Sec-
retary andas a member of the College
Council, which the 1912 Cyclone
deﬁned as “an organimtion which
crystallizesandprescrvesthosethings
that are best in the Grinnell Spirit."

Not content with purely cerebral
pursuits, Harry Hopkins was an avid
participantinGrinnellathletics.Harry
played on the tennis team and lettered
in basketball in an exceptionally good
season for the Pioneers.

Although Hopkins’ later career

 

success had little to do with his per-
formance on the court, his involve-
mentin YMCA didperhapshintathis
future. He was a member of the
YMCA cabinet and was in charge of
“auditing and employment" for the
organization. In 1911, Hopkins also
panicipated in the “vacation service
program,” an analogue to the current
Alternative Breaks.
Hallie Flanagan

Like Harry Hopkins, several of
Hallie Flanagan’s campus activities
relate to her later accomplishments as
a professor of theater and head of the
Federal Theater Project. Hallie
Ferguson (her maiden name) was also
from Grinnell,andshegraduated only
one year before Hopkins in 1911.

Jeanne Bentley‘s biography relates
that "mostof her classmates regarded
Hallie as a leader." and rightfully so.
She was a member of the YWCA
cabinet and served as the president of
the society club. She was also ath-
letic, and she edited a monthly liter-
ary magazine called "The Unit.“

Later known for her promotion of
“Experimental Theater," Flanagan
was very dramatic while at Grinnell.
She was a member of the Drama Club
and theEllis Forensics society,which
regularly debated against the many
other forensic societies on campus.

Hallie’sdramatic rolesperhaps did
not fully portend her later imponance
in the theater, but she did frequently
appear on stage. She played Miss
Gertrude Wood in “The Girl with the
GrcenEyes” andportrayed a“captive
princess" in “Nero,” Hallie Ferguson
did not have a part in the senior play
in 1911, however.

Though she later directed the Fed-
eral Theater Project, Hallie “wone
dered whether Grinnell had over-
strcsscdpublic service,“ Bentley said.

the lives of famous alumni during their days at Grinnell College

Flanagan alsoinsisted that the“main
thing that happened" to her at Gnn-
nellwas meetingherhusband,Munay
Flanagan.

Herbie Hancock

Grammy and Academy Award
winning musician, Herbie Hancock
(known as Herbert while attending
Grinnell) hailed from Chicago, 111i-
nois. When heenrolled in Grinnell at
age16,Hancock hadatready appeared
as a soloist with the Chicago Symr
phony Orchestra. He graduated in
1960 with a degree in music. While a
student, he lived in the somewhat
staid Gates Halli

Perhaps one can see Hancock's
propensity towards the cutting edge
in his choice of campus activities.
Herbert shunned the choir, glee club,
and other formal music groups, and
instead played piano and sang in a
group called the “Velvetones.” He
was also a disc jockey for the college
radio station. KGRW.

Were the collegeactivities of these
noted graduates necessary prerequi-
sites for their success? Who among
us will become the next Harry
Hopkins, Hallie Flanagan or Herbie
Hancock? Wecan all share the“Grin-
nell Experience," but only time can
tell about the fame.

known scholars as Cynthia Enloe,
Barbara Christian, and Jean lew,

According toMinnie Alexander,a
student committee member, these
speakers are important in that “they
highlight the diversity withinthe ﬁeld
ofWomen‘s Studies. All diespwkers
are unique,and this shows how broad
die discipline is.”

Student committee member Nora
Bloch also recognizes the diversity
within the ﬁeld of Women’s studies.
“Like Cynthia Enloe said, one can
pretty much make a gender analysis
of any situation. . .The goal of Noun is
really to ensure that these gender
analyses are being made."

Committee members demonstrate
satisfaction in the work that’s being
done HeatherRychenerremarks, “lt's
empowering that I'm a part of this
organization that‘s looking at all dif<
ferent perspectives on gender issues.
I’ve been exposed to. a variety of
experiences and interpretations of
feminism that I may never have
thought about And to me. the main
goal offeminism is to lookatall sides
of an issue"

“The speakers become real to me.
They're real people with real issues
that need to be discussedrrffhrough
Noun, I‘m helping to support these
issues," remarked Chance.

While reaction to the program by
much of the college community has
been positive, some students demon-
strate indifference. Some. in fact,
claim to never have gone to a Noun-
sponsored speakerr

Angie Arnold, senior with a con-
centration irt Gender and Women’s
Studies, remarks that while this is
unfortunate, “It’s like anything else.
It's going to appeal to some people
more than others.”

Rychenersees this indifference as
being further need for the program.
“It‘s imponant for people to go to
these talks and listen," she said “The
pointis that a lot of these speakers are
notinthe mainstream,and thus repre-
sent views to which people might not
otherwise be exposed."

“Their power to change the sys-
tem is immense," said Rychenerr
