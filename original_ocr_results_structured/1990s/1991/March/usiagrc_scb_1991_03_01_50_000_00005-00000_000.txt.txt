Yard gives convocation speech on feminism

By Rina Khan

Molly Yard, President of the
National Organisation for Women
spoke about the issues offeminism
andactivismin theUnitedStales to
a packed Herrick Chapel audience
yesterday.

Yard has been involved in the
women's movement since the
1960's and is one of the nation’s
most prominent feminist activists.
Having received her education at
Swarthmore College, she has
struggled fortheequalityof women
for more than halfa century.

Yard began her lecture With a
brief history of the women‘s
movement in the U.S. She de-
scribed thesuffrage movement that
eventually secured the vote for
women in 1920 after seventy-two
years of struggle. She also mm,
tioned the strong impact on femi-
nism of the book Feminine Mys—
tique, which led to the ﬁrst NOW
conference in Washington DC,
twenty years ago.

Yard stressed that according to
several polls conducted by Time
Magazine and CNN, NOW is a
mainstream organisation that is
“verymuchinlouchwilhthewomen
in the country.“ She quoted statis-
tics showing the increase in the
number of women in colleges and
the work force which is a direct
resultoiNOW’ssucccssfulstrugglc
to end discrimination against
women in colleges in 1972.

Although the women's move
ment has achieved many of its
original goals,Yardemphasized the
need to “continue the ﬁghL” She
pointed out that there is still no
Equal Rights Amendment in the
consLituLion and eressed the im-
ponance of this goal.

Yarddevotedtheremainingpart
of her lecture to the many speciﬁc
problems faced by women in the
US. She began with the sharp
inequalityinwages,aproblemraced
byall working women. lnAmerica

"Women are ripped
off by male-domi-
nated institutions of
which colleges are a
par . ”

--Molly Yard

stated that “women are ripped off
by malecdominaled institutions of
which colleges are a part."
Shecontjnued wilhstatlslics that
highlighted the violence that is
committed against women in this
country. crimes which are increas-
ing at a rate of 12% every year.
Every 15 minutes awoman is raped
in thiscountry. Shepointcdouttttat
violence againstwomen‘goes way
back when they were children" and
listed the high numbers of sexually
abused children. She felt that there
was some hope in coping with this
violence in the form ofa bill that

will shortly be introduced in Conn
gross that adrcsses this problem.

The other goals that are being
pursued by NOW is for an increase
in the minimum wage and for the
need of equity pay in the case of a
newbomorasickchildinthe family.
The problem of unemployment in
cities and teenage pregnancy was
alsoadrcssed.Yardpointcdoutthat
teenagers who were forced to give
birth, as aresult of lack of access to
reproductive health care or contrac
ceptives, wereusually“condemned
to a life ofpoverly", having to drop
out of highcschool.

Yard continued her speech with
the topic of feminism and war. Slte
stressed that “feminists have never
supported war.” She described war
andwarpsychologyasanli-humanc
“instruments of U.S. foreign and
domestic policies.” in regard to the
current Persian GulfCrisis, she felt
that sanctions should have been al-
towed to work and that in view of
the massivedestruclion ofthe envi-
ronment and of innocent lives,

“there has to be a better way." She
pointed out the irony of the U.S.
defense of a country that is not a
democracy and which has no rights
for women, who are in fact treated
as second class citizens.

She also felt that the problems
faced by tthalestinians have been
ignored for too long. She porntcd
out that the Palestinians “havejust
as much right to live there", and
described the “sensible" efforts
made by Palestinian and Israeli
women to work towards peace. She
added that NOW will be participalv
ingin asummitofmeetingofgroups
around the world in an attempt to
bring peace to the MtddlccEast.

Yard concluded her speech by
emphasizing the need to bring
women's voices to bear on making
public policy. She stated that “it
was unjustiﬁed for our society to
allow these serious problems to
continue." She ended by emphati»
callydeclaringthat“individuaiscan
make a difference and have made a
difference."

In response ‘to assaults, workshop tackles race issues

By Sarah Purcell

With a background of racially
motivated attacks on intemationat
students,IheOfliccofMulticultural
Affairs sponsored a racism woric
shop led by Ali Rashad Umrani.
Wednesday in South Lounge.

Umrani said he was glad of the
invitation to speak at Grinnell bee
cause he "understood there were
some problems here." He said
racial tensions on campuses are
common,andthatitisirnponant
for students to coniront“issues
that are raised constantly.”

Umranistressedlhatitispos-
sible for young people to “work
for political and social change,"
because racism is ”not a genetic
disease,“ but a societal strucutIe.

Today's problems with racism
in American cities, according to
Umrani, are the legacy of the late
1960's and 1970's when “white
flight" caused “ghettos to spring
up“ in American inner cities.

Umrani asked that participants
in the workshop be “honest," think
in terms of“urban America" and in
terms of conﬂict between “black
and white."

Ummni cited a “Swedish soci-
ologist," who argued in the 1940‘s
that “Black anger was the direct
inverse ofwhile fears.“ He stressed
that “Black anger “is the only thing
whites respond to," because of en-
trenched societal racism.

He placed most whites into cat-
egories of “Intellectuals,” “Chris
tians," “Liberals," “Innocents,”
“progressives," and» “Conserva-
tives.” and described the typical
reaction of each group to a chair
lengc agninstracism. He criticized
many white college students who
have been active against racism as
being ”only while radicals for four
years," after which they return to
"ll‘trw piece suites" and “become
the authority on black folks.”

“Being black in America is like
walking on ice and not knowing
where the thin spots are," said
Umrani. This precarious cultural
position means that “black people
can be friends with whites to the
extent that their blackness is not
Verbalized." To fit into society, he
said that most African-Americans
“have to compromise or...ztbandon
thetr heritage."

"Racism hurts all of us. It
tears away at the veryfab-

ric.ofAmerican society.”
--Ali Rashad Umrani

Because of the upswing in public
racism in Ihelastfew years,Umrant
said that "black anger should be a
barometer" for needed social
change, “Racism hurts all of us. It
tears away at the very fabric of
American society...We have to are
rive at some constructive solutions
for the problem." he added.

Umrani likened the struggle for
Black liberation to that of other
oppressedgroups,including Asians.
Hispanics, Native Americans.
women, and gays and lesbians. He
demonstrated the stratification of
society which has been dominated
by white males saying that mzlny
while women “have abandoned
theiridentity,"Whenchallengcdas
to what “their identity" meant.

Umrani responded that if ”a

white female realizes that she

wants torise,she has tocompro-
misc her femininity."

Umrani sad that oppressed
people should not “buy into the
system.” but rather insist that

the system give them a fair chance.
As an example of “oppressed
people" helping each other to
struggle he cited the strong support
that Douglas Wilder received from
women in his campaign to become
governor of Virginia.

Umrani emphasized that one
should not “blame the victim" for
