A letter never sent

Iknowthatlastsemmterlprom-
ised not to write anything political.
I have since decided that it is nearly
impossible formeto writeanything
that isn’t political in some way, I
composed this letter in early Febru»
ary, planning to make copies of it
and send it through Ann Landers to
soldiers in the Gulf. I never mane
aged to getuiat done. andIam more
or less pleased to acknowledge that
I never will. I thought some ofmy
readers might find it interesting.

Dear Soldier,

Greetings from Grinnell, Iowal
My name is Alanna Walen, and I
am a student at Grinneil College. I
apologize for the fact that this is a
form letter, but I have a message
that I would like to send to more
than one person in “the Gulf,” and
my handwriting isn't all that great
anyway.

I don’t know what will be hap-
pening over there as you read this
letter, butas I write it, the air strikes
seem to be working fairly well and
the ground forces are preparing for
anassaulton Kuwait. Atleastthat’s
what the media is allowed to share
with us - there is a general suspicion
over here that the government isn’t
really telling us what is going on.
We cottld be losing the war, for all
I know, and they just aren‘t letting
us in on it. I sincerely hope thatas
you read this, things are going well,
however you may define well. I
hope for peace.

Which is why I’m writing this
letter. There have been many pro-
tests here against the U.S. military
actions in the Persian Gulf, as I’m

Alanna Walen

sure you have heard. There have
been some flag-bumings, which I
disagreewith,butlwanttorcassure
you that most of the protests have
been against the basic idea of in-
volvement in the Middle East, not
against the members of the miliv
tary. I have participated in one or
these protests. and I suspect] will
be participating inmore as the war
falls to end quickly. I would like to
explainmyposition to you, in hopes
that you might better understand
the frustrated support of many of
the “protesters,"

I don't think the United States
should be involved in the problems
of the Middle East. At the risk of
sounding skeptical. peace in the
Middle East is about as likely as a
beautiful snowfall in hell. Our
President says we are fighting
against the “naked aggression" of
Iraq, yet he has ignored the naked
aggression of South Africa, U.S.r
supponed diciatorships in Central
America, and other regimes all over
the world for years. We— you 7
are there because of the need to
protect the oil supply and Bush‘s
desire to focus the country's atten-
Liononawarinstcadofherdomestic
problems, which now seem un-
worthy of the media’s attention. In
fact, the many millions of dollars
being spenton this war could prob-
ably have helped to solve many of
ourdomestic problems'l'hatis how
I feel about our involvement.

Yet I support you, and every

US. soldier involved in thcaction.
You are doing your duty; you are
fighting for us. You are bravely
following orders. The reporters
seem concerned that our protests
are demoralizing the troops. Please
don’t take our protests as malicious
attacks on your duties.

I don't feel personally threat-
ened by this war. I’m not afraid of
being hit by a Scud missile or at
tacked by terrorists. As a woman,
I‘m not afraid of the draft. I want
this war to end, and I wish it had
never begun, because I don't want
you to suffer. I don’t think your
life,oranyAmerican'slife, is worth
the debateoverwhich patch of sand
belongs to which Arab dictator, I
know it sounds trite, but we protest
because we want tobring you home
safely. And the govemmentdoesn't
listen to quiet disagreement, so we
have to be loud in the only way we
can: in the streets.

There is some concern that this
will be “another Vietnam." I think
thatthis wardiffers from that“conr
flict" in several very important
ways. The leaders of today's pror
tests have learned from the pastand
include support for the troopsas they
disagree with the President. You
will be treated with respect when
you return, because today‘s activ-
ists are not stoned, are usually
educated, and leamt-d in the past
that soldiers do not deserve the
blame for the conﬂict.

Though I disagree with many
aspects ofourculture and society, I
am proud to be an American. I am
proud of you, and I sincerely hope
that you return.

Opposition vs. support

Heather Strait

The war in the Persian Gulf is
finally coming to an end. I am very
glad, as are many other war pro-
testers and even, yes believe it or
not kids, even some of the pro
U.S. folks. Why? Because we
learned our lesson from Vietnam.
Never again will we watch our
peopledieforquestionablecauses.
nor will we condemn our brave
soldiersfordoingwhatthcyhaveto
do. Asmyverboseassociate,Mike
Washbum, so indelicately wrote,
the protests ofthe last few months
havebeen much different from those
of the late sixties and early seven-
ties, but I’m afraid his explanation
is a bu off. He seems to think that
thelackofradicalcivildisobedience
is due to the fact that there was no
draft for cowardly people to yell
about. Well Mike, 1 think you're
wrong.

I belong tndrumerrdtitcntorgu

nization that believes in supporting
ournation and especime our troops
but claims that the terrors of war
must be stopped. Again and again,
I have heard people say that those
who know war are the ones who
hate it most. Every meeting is be-
gun with the pledge of allegiance
and a short prayer, often one for

peace. Another group I belong to
holds these same beliefs. They
workinavarietyofways.including
essay contests and community Scr~
vice, to help young and old people
try to understand how we can love
our country and be good citizens

Feminism, imperialism,
and the PC dilemma

Jordan Magill

Peopleath'nnellalwaysliketo
think of themselves as opcnv
minded. In fact, some might argue
that they are so open minded that.
their brains are on the verge of
falling out Some people have al-
lowed themselves to become so
“deep” and, dare I say it, correct,
that they are incapable of seeing
blatant logical contradictions in
their basic ideology. Take the ex-
ample of imperialism and
eurocentrieity. Not that long ago,
the majority of Europeans believed
they were inherently culturally su-
perior to everybody else and that it
was their Gad given task to explain
that factto everyone. If they didnot
listen, they were simply savag“
whoneededtobe taughtatthepoint
of a sword. Now at Grinnell, im—
pen'alism has been explained all
too well.

For those who have missed the
boat, and I, for one, am not sure
how anyone could have, consider
ing the noise madeaboutit—imper
rialism is an off-shoot of our
eurocentric. patriarchal, male-
dominated society. This. at least, is
Grinnell‘s view of things. Now let
me set onething straight: Iam white,
male, and most certainly not an
imperialist I am n0t even one of
the newfangled, intellectual impe-
rialistsl’vebecn hearingabout.You
know the sortilhose who believe
thatEuropean thought is inherently
betterthcnotherpeople's.The truth
is, however, the PC crowd is right
there are intellectual imperialists
outthere;they‘renotallintheWhite
House, and they‘re notall reading
The Closing ofthe American Mind.
Most of them are the most PC of
people,likelastweek'sconvocation
speaker, Molly Yard.

Molly Yard, a person of great
integrity and political correcuiess,
is by philosophical choiceaeultuml
imperialist. Now let me set another
thing straight: i am not a sexist. I
support Ms. Yard's organization,
the National Organization for

Women,andlsupporttheERA.All
of the name calling and labeling
could not hide the truth ofthe evi-
dence. MollyYard isafeministand
an imperialist. In addition, she
seems to think that for us to be
feminists, we must be imperialists
too,

Ms. Yard in her speech argued
that the U.S. should not defend
Saudi Arabia or Kuwait because it
is a sexiststate. She is correct; they
are, by OUR standards. sexist states.
Women are not equal under the law
and do notenjoy the same rights as
men, She also explained to a stu-
dentprivately that. since theU.S. is
there, we should IMPOSE equal
rights lawson Iraq and Kuwait. She
drew whatwasasimple analogy, if
we can attempt to impose racial
equality on South Africa, then we
should be able to imposegender
equality on the gulf states. But the
analogy does not hold.

The culture of the Middle East,
however, is not South Africa. It is
supponed by the majority of the
population. While there are, I’m
sure. some people who oppose the
sexual order of the Middle East,
they appear to be in the minority.

We may notwantto aeceptthat,but
it appears to be true. They are ac

tually proud of their culture and
civilization and, not only that, have
every right and reason to be.
Some have argued that at the
very least uicse women should have
thechaneetoexperienceourculturc
so that they can choose. To this I
have to ask why? Is it that they
should experience our culture,
which is OF COURSE,soSuperior,
so that they get a chance to realize
its superiority? I, for one, am not so
sure about the inherent superiority
of our culture. I have never been a
cannibal, but with the exception of
the cannibals, few would claim my
life was deficient until I had. The
truth be told, the people of the
Middle East, at least many of the
intellectual elite, are aware of the
west and whatit has to offer. They
