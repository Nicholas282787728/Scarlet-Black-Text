:COMMON SENSE
Harkin, Duke and the 1992 election

I hope that David Duke enters the
race for the presidency. If he does,
we’ll witness some good oldrfashe
ioned political troglodytism: Duke’s
rivals condemning him as a little
Hitler, and Duke accusing them of
raping the middle class. Of course
Dukedoesn‘tdeservetobecomeprcsir
dent, but then neither does anyone
who is now in the race.

Torn Harkin's supporters must
suffer from historical amnesia. If not.
then they must see nothing wrong
with Harkin‘ssupportforPolPot.Pol
Pot, you will recall, is a leader of the
Khmer Rouge. who. upon ousting the
Cambodian governmentin l975,mur-
dered some two million people, inr
cluding 400,000 children. Harkin, as
a US. Senator, voted for aid to this
man. He also voted for aid to Nonh
Vietnam, Idi Amin, and the
Sandinistas. Harkin’s other foreign
policy triumphs deserve a brief look.

Idi Amin took power in Uganda in
1971 by toppling Milton Obote and
proclaiming himsetfthenewpremier.
An African dictator par excellence,
he butchered 300,000 of “his” people
and drove thousands of others to flee
the country. The North Vietnamese,
when they overran the South in 1975,
began a reign of tenor which claimed

300,000 lives and spawned a million
and a half boat people. And the
Sandinistas, after their 1979 coup,
murdered draft resisters, real and
imagined comm collaborators, and
farmers who resisted the seizure of
theirland.Theirprisonsheld,attimes,
10,000pcople,onwbom they inflicted
grotesque tonures.

Duke-the-kook looked fondly on
the murderers of six million. Harkin,
the estimable senator and a legiti-
mate,mainstreampresidentialcandi-
date, voted for military aid to the
murderers of three million.

The remaining Democratic oppo~
sition is an array of no-names and
kooks, Clinton, Kerrey and Tsongas
falling into the former category,
Brown into the latter. That the dis-
graceful Harkin is one of the most
prominent and respected Democratic
contenders indicates that Duke does
indeed have a real chance.

Bush doesn’t have a domestic
policygat least not a coherent one.
He seems not to realize that most
Americans are far more concerned

about domestic affairs than foreign
ones. Moreover, his foreign policy
has been disastrous. The war against
Iraq failed to accomplish what Bush.
when he bothered to explain it, gave
as one of its main objectives—the
destruction of Hussein’s nuclear
power. Listening to a White House
spokesmen say that “we had no idea
how much stuff [Hussein] had," one
wondered ifBush’scomic book intel-
lect was even suited to the tasks itset
for itself.

Only Bush can top Dan Quayle in
inanity. This might seem a challenge
after Quayle’s famous observation,
“What a waste it is to lose one‘s
mind—ornottohaveamind.”(Apolo—
gies to the United Negro College
Fund) But Bush is up to it: last Au-
gust he repeatedly denounced the
Soviet coup as “unconstitutional," as
though legality ever had anything to
do with Soviet affairs.

How the liberals trembled after
Duke finished second in the October
runoff. "This reminds me of Ger»
many in 1928." whined Lance Hill,
head of something called the Louisi-
ana Coalition Against Nazism and
Racism. His hyperbole isn’t surpris-

EYES WIDE OPEN

Social awareness— a futile struggle?

This past Sunday I had the opporv
' tunity to go see Ferron in concert.
(For all of you Baby Dyke types.
Ferron is an out lesbian folk-singer
with a voice and style all her own.
Highly recommended.) Ferron spent
a lot of time talking about her own
perceptions of life and love and ev-
erything under the sun. At one point
she spoke about the people in our
lives with whom we do not agree, and
with whom we absolutely do not get
along. She said that thesepeople help
us to grow. They spur us on to higher
heights. We have to thank them.
Falling short of that task, I began
to think about Grinnell and its fac»
tions. I thought about the Housing
Policy and the issues surrounding it
in my first year. The massive OrganL
zation andprolests brought the Queer
Community together and provided a
strong bond between the Queers and
the rest of campus. I remembered
when the parodies of protesting hip-
pies started—in that same year. 1 re
membered the onslaughtof misinfor-
mation and hate that brought us to-
gether again this year, not quite as
tightly and much more quietlyl
Thenlbegan to thinkofGrinnell‘s
past. Notjust my own history here,
but the history of all students at
Grinnell. I‘ve done some research
anddelvedintooldSmrlemndBlacks,
only to find that there have been inde-
pendent pseudo-ultra-conservative
papers before. They were also heir
nously offensive, while at the same
time, they managed to be excruciat-
ingly boring. The same issues come

West

up again and again, with just as much
vigor, though sometimes more and
sometimes less There have always
been a handful of radicalspounding a
drum (or a shoe). And most of the
campus has always been somewhere
in between.

Queers have always been ﬁghting
for visibility and the right to be vis-
ible without fear. We still struggle:
some accuse us of winning and not
shutting up. Others understand that

every time we reach for our freedom
we must redeﬁne ourselves and re»
explain why we deserve to live. We
become organized, then over-orga-
nized. We shoot ourselves in the foot
and start 211 over again We restrict
ourselves with our organizations and
then create more—only to let them
dieHaven’tweleamed anythingyet?
Haven‘t you learned anything yet?
Blacks on this campus suffer many
of the same problems, I think. ConV
stantly crying out for recognition,
getting it, only to be ignored again

THE
GLASS

Farewell, Grinnell
I’ll miss you—NOT!

The time has come for me to leave
the academic fantasyland known as
GrinnellCollege. That‘srightpeople.
Elisa isheading offfor thereal world.

Well. okay, so I’m going to stay in
thetownofGrinnell, butitstillcounts.
I’m taking some time off, getting my
life straightened out. Sorting through
all the mucky-muck, as it were.

lguess ifl were reallyleaving,like
far away or something, I would have
to say goodbye to all my friends I
couldn’t name them all here, because
I would inevitably leaveafew people
out. thereby offending them. I'm
thinking that’s not a good idea. SO,
out of fairness to all of you, I would
probably miss you. If Iknow you, that
is. And, perhaps. if I like you. Or at
leastifl don’tabsolutely despise you.
You get the idea.

Anyway,thinkofthethingslwon't
have to kick around anymore.

The Harris Center. Yeah, I guess
in my own weird way I’m going to
miss that architectural nightmare.
There‘s just not enough neon in town
to satisfy me. And, oh, that disco
ball. ..

Dorm life. There’s nothing quite
like the sound of laughter and geneml
merriment outside your door at 1:30
in the morning when you have :1 ca]-
culus test at 8 am. that day. And, oh,
those comfy beds

Quad and Cowles. That‘srighl. no
more starch fests for me. And just
when l was getting to the point where
I could sand the smell ofparty pota—
toes. And, oh, that Moroccan
Couscous...

Classes and profs. Ywh. Right.
I’ve been so happy about the fact that
Grinnell has such a wonderful stu-
dent to faculty ratio of course, for
$17,000 a year, it’s really pointless
when you can't get in to see a prof
when it really counts. And, oh, those
meaningful papers.“

Theliberal,open-minded students
here. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha haha
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. 0h, stop, you‘re

killing me.

Nov/.mylifewillbefilledwiththe
joy of toilet cleaning. The wonders of
pot-and -pan-scrubbing. The thrill of
shower-scum removal.

1 also have to get a job. Grinnell
has prepared me well for this task. 1
can just see myself in the employ-
mentofﬁce.

“Um, well. okay, 1 can type. And,
uh, oh, yeah, well, I can. uh, write
papers aboutart. 0h,and X can uh.tell
youanythingyouwanttoknowabout
human sexuality. So, do I get the
job?"

Elisa
Martin

Boy, howdy, has Grinnell taught
me what 1 need to get by in the world

But justsofuture generationsdon‘t
get caught in the same trap that I'm in
let‘s start offering some new classes.
Here's whatl want to see in the next
course offering sheets:

REAL LHTE 101.01. Class will
focus on how people in the world
outside Grinnell College interact and
relate. Emphasis on coping with be—
ing called a loserby some other loser,
how to changeaflat tire andcheck the
oilinacarandhowtoprogram the
timerona VCR. Class will also study
the lives of people who can't live off
their parents’ wealth and will attempt
to understand the people in these situ-
ations. (+2 available in the form of
internships at Hardee’s, Taco John‘s
or S ubway)

RHYTHM 223.01, 223.02. Class
will teach rhythmically challenged
students how to listen to and feel the
beat of music. Students will be ex-
pectedto attend weekend functions in
the Harris Centerasapartofresearch.
Final exam will consist of dancing to
intricate, syncopated beats Prerequi-
