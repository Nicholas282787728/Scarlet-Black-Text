Mkhondo lectures on South Africa

By Julie Pecaut

_.—.._

Rich Mkhondo, South African
joumalistandReuterscorrespondent,
gave a lecture recently on the current
situation in South Africa and pre-
sented his analysis of what lay in
store for the future of this unique
country.

Mkhondo’s objective manner
might serve as one explanation of
how he manages to maintain profes-
sional, as well as personal, relation-
ships with the various integral mem-
bers of the wltite minority govem-
ment, members of liberal and conser-
vative religious groups. business
managers. and the African National
Congress.

To begin his Rosenﬁeld Program-
sponsoredlecture,Mlthondorcadsev-
era] interviews he had written about
his personal friends, including one
with a friend whose family had been
slaughteredsavefortwochildrenwho
had escaped. The friend believed that
supponers of the lnkatha movement
of Zulu Chief Gatsha Buthlezi had
been responsible.

Another friend. a local ANC sup—
porter, found that his house had been
attacked, although no one was seri-
ously injuredwhen Mkhondo asked
why his friend why he would not
leave, the friend spoke of his personal
responsibility to improve the area in
which he lived He was murdered
earlier this year.

Mkhondo then explained that. in
his view, while idllings have been

less widespread recently, they are
more speciﬁc. Activists and leaders
of the ANC in particular are being
singled out for harassment and assase
sination. He sighted the fact that, un-
der the former regime of Pieter W.
Botha, 40 such individuals had been
killed, while in the shorter tenure of
the current president, F.W. de Klerk,
about 60 have been killed. He corrcr
latcd thistothe factthattheANCis in
charge of negotiations with the white
minority government, In other words,
forces are at work to see that the
ANC’s position is weakened when
they meet with the government to
decide on the country's future at talks
scheduled for the end of this month.
Yet, when asked about the possi-
bility of a coup d’elat, Mkhondo dis-
missed such an act as being unlikely
and impractical because, much like
the August coup in the Soviet Union.
desperate pardcipants in such a ma-
neuver would receive no support and
would not survive very long.
Audience members also ques-
tioned whether a third force was at
work itt promoting the recent inter-
etltnic violence, such as occurred two
weeks ago. Mkhondo responded, “I
believe there isa fourth force at work.
No, I am joking.” But he actually
expanded on this concepthy explain-
ing thatthegovemmenthaslittle cona
trol at this moment over much of the
powerful police and military forces.
Segments of these two forces, in ad-
dition to members of the government
itself, had been ﬁnancing and/or arm-

ing cenain groups.

He gave an example of one town
in the southem pan of the country
where it was revealed in court that
police agents had been privately arm-
ing atleastoneoftwo gangs involved
in local violence. Another example is
the revelation that a South African
government minister had helped to
finance lnkatha, a movement usually
considered to rival the ANC. Though
no larger conspiracy had been proven,
Mkhondo indicated that a vertical
network most probably exists to some
extent. in which money and artns are
passed down.

Finally, Mkhondo revealed his vi-
sion of how events will unfold in
South Africa. He projected that by the
middle of next year an interim coali-
tion government would be in power,
though manyfearthatifnotallparties
were involved. civil war would oc-
cur. He also projected a referendum
would be presented by de Klerk in
which he would ask fora mandate to
continue his reforms. Mkhondo added
that the outcome of such a referen-
dum is uncertain because for many
who are uncertain of Nelson Mandela
(including many blacks) de Klerk is
seen as a legitimate leader. But in the
end elections foranew majority gov-
ernment would take place by the
spring of 1994, according to
Mkhondo.

Workshop studies racism
and Asian-Americans

By Michael Hanna

Upon hearing the word “racism."
one normally tends to think of it in
terms of prejudice against African-
Amcricans. Little attention is paid to
racism against AsianrAmericans, al»
though they as a group experience
prejudice and battle stereotypes as
well.

Donna M. Talbot, Assistant oflu-
dicial Programs at the University of
Maryland, conducted a racism work
shop Tuesday in South Lounge to
explore the issue of racism against
Asian-Americans.Tlteworkshopwas
part of Asian Awareness Week at
Grinnell.

Aftorsharing some of her personal
experiences with prejudice, Talbot
began a “four comers" activityr Par—
ticipants in the workshop were chala
lenged to take a stand on various
Statements aboutAsianvAmericansby
moving to a comer marked “agree",
“disagree". “strongly agree”, or
“stronglydisagree”. Participants from
each group then shared why they had
chosen to agree or disagree with each
statement.

Issues introduced by Talbot in-
cluded terminology, speciﬁcally the
use of the term “Oriental” and the
idea of Asians as the “model minor»
ity". Asian-American students ex-
plained the problems with the term
“Oriental": “People see it as some-
thing exotic...that we're just so difv
ferent." said one student.

Another student made the point

that “Oriental" automatically desig-
nates America and Europe as refer.
enccpointsand thusdividesthe world
into “us and them”, while Talbot as- ‘
sened that“Asian~American” evokes .
the image of a much richer cultural
u-adition. ‘
Anotherimponant issue discussed .
was the comparison of Asian-Ameri- .
cans to other minority groups. When
asked to take a stand on whether’
Asian»Americans had experienced ,
less prejudice than ether minority
groups, several students remained in "
the middle. “You can’t make,
generalizations. . ..it‘s wrong to com-
pare peoples‘ suffering," asscned one‘
student. <
Talbot agreed. “I believe the roots A
of oppression areconnecled,” she said.
She added that comparing prejudices '
“pits one group against another and ,
doesn't beneﬁt anybody.”
“Overreprcsentation” in higher'
education brought up the issue oft
comparison as well. Talbot likened
the idea of representation of minority '
groups in education to a pic in which
all minorities mustshareapiece. The.
groups end up ﬁghting over this piece
rather than ﬁghting for the pie. ‘
In addition to terminology and,
comparisons, Talbot addressed the
stereotype of Asians as hardworking,‘
superintelligent, and docile—-the<
myth of the “model minority". Stu-_
dents discussed the pressure this puts
on AsianvAmericans, as well as the
