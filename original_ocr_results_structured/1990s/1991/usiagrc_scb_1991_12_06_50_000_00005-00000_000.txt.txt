CLASS OF1991: LIFE AFTER GRINNELL

Married graduate feels impact of recession

By Louise Aleom

After ﬁnishing her senior year at
Grinnell, which included a spring in-
tcmship,laurelBattlesMagmder‘91,

' who is originally from Wooster,0hio,
took some big steps. She had decided
to find a full-time job somewhere
before going on to graduate school,
not an unusual choice.

What is perhaps less usual is that
shcchose to find ajob in Iowa and get
married. In August, she married a
fellow Grinnellsludent from Oregon.
Jamie Magruder. now a senior (class
of ‘92). They are now living in
Norwalk, Iowa and both of them com-
mute,]amic to Grinnelland Laurel to

West Des Moines.

ln West Des Moines, Laurel works
for Accent Services, a collections
agency, doing data entry. She says
theworkcanbcdiscouraging,asmany
of the records she deals with are
records of unemployed people trying
to getalong on credit. She herselfhad
three months of unemployment after
leaving Grinnell, which she admits
was pretty scary.

When asked if Grinnell had pre-
pared herforlife in thereal world, she
replied“lt prepared me for an idealis-
tic world that’s now in a recession,
so..." but added that she felt she had
gotten some help from the school,
especially from her inlemship.

Laurel finds her work interesting.
ifnot “mentally satisfying." She said
it is enlightening to work with people
who are “not Grinnellians” and to
learn about their lives. In addition,
she is taking some extra classes in the
Des Moines area.

Her advice for the class of ‘92 is:
Don’t take life too seriously. Every-
thing will fall together, just hang in
there. It’s hard and it's not always
how you plan it. will be, but it can be
rewarding.

She knows what pressure is like
here during the last year at Grinnell,
but she encourages seniors to start
looking at their choices right now.

Alum ﬁnds her views challenged

By Lisa Ranahan

Carin Bringleson ‘91works as a
volunteer in Bethwda, Maryland as
part of a volunteer corps and lives
with four other recent college gradu-
ates inahouseprovidedby theUnited
Church ofChrist. In return for food,
health insurance, transponation and a
monthly stipend, she works full-time
at theSasha Bruce Youthwork House
for runaway teens ages 12-17.

She is the education coordinator
and provides learning programs for
the residents who might not be at-
tending school for one reason or an-
other. Her duties have expanded to
counseling responsibilities as well.
She now has a speciﬁc client with
whom she creates goals for dealing
with his personal issues and finding
his own housing and employment.

While Bringleson does get frus~
ttatcd with her students sometimes,
she finds her work rewarding and
said her coworkers are “caring, com-
petent people with a great sense of
humor." She is enthusiastic about her
work and involved with the clientele.

Bringleson was especially moved
bya 16-year-old wholested l-HVposi-

tive. “He is the first person I know,
other than famous people, who has
AIDS. It’s scary as hell at 16—scary
as hell anytime—and he’s dealing
with this without the support of his
family,“ she explained.

While her job relates to her sociol-
ogy and African Studies major.
Bringleson said “the classroom is
nothing like I am experiencing,”
Grinnell helped herprepare, but“thcre
is nothing like on the job training,“
she concluded.

She found her job through the
Community Service Center, not the
CaroerDevelopmentOfﬁcc.Theonly
other job for which she applied was
Teach For America. She was offered
a position in Phoenix but chose the
Washington DC. area over Phoenix.

Bringleson said everything at
Grinnell was educational, not just the
classes, and that its intensity helped
to prepare her for the work environ
ment. She said that she was ready to
leave her senior year at Grinnell and
isgladtobemissingfinalsnextweck.
Like many of us, she is not sure she
ever wants to write another paper.
She called Grinnell a “pressure
cooker" and she said that studans

tend to explode out of Grinnell.

She keeps in contact with her
friends but finds it particularly diffi-
cult to do so with the students still on
campus. They don’t have the time to
write, and neither she nor her friends
havclhcfundslocall.Shehasbumped
into other Grinnellians on the DC.
Metro and at the Women Take Back
theNightrally but has yet tohaveany
ofﬁcial contact through the alumni
association.

“Don‘t worry. Things will work
out. People get too stressed,"
Bringleson advised Grinnell students.

She warns, though. that Grinnell
does not prepare students for cone
frontations. She says that Mike Kent
will be better prepared for life after
Grinnell because he is used to people
challenging his views. She left
Grinnell unprepared to deal with the
prevalenceofissues like homophobia
and sexism in the workplace. Her
initial reaction was “I Can’t believe
that person just said that!“ She feels
that Grinnell provides a supportive
environmentfordevelopingideashut
that students do not face the serious
challenges that will come from the
rest of society.

Graduate lands job with Federal Reserve

Joel T. Krueger,classof‘9l, works
in Minneapolis for the Federal Re-
serve as a technical research analyst.
advising senior economists and pro-
viding them witheconomic forecasts.
The economists with which he works
“meet every six weeks with Alan
Greenspan and decide what to do
about interest rates."

Kruegermajored in math and eco-
nomics at Grinnell. He said that he
was hired with two other people, one
with amastersdegreein math and one
with a bachelor‘s degree in general
science. Hedidnot feel any less quali-
fied than the other two new employ—
ees, but he said that he could not have
taken enough math classesatGi-innell
to prepare him for his job. He did not
take any computer science classes at
Grinnell, and, as result, had to learn
five new computer languages during
training in order to perform his job.
He feels that he made the adjustment

to the work environment well.

“What I took most from Grinnell
was the ability to learn on my own,“
he said, adding that individual atten—
tion and advice given to him by pro-
fessors helped him to develop his
ability to learn and to adjust.

Krueger started his job search in
September ofhis senior year and had
interviews in January and Febmary
bug by spring break, still did not have
ajob. Helearned about the job at the
Federal Reserve through a letter Pro-
fessor Munyon had received asking
him to encourage his students to ap-
ply for the position. Krueger applied
for the job, flew to Minnesota for an
interview and had the job within a
couple of weeks.

“I was less than impressed with
the Career DevelopmentOflice,"said
Krueger. He feels that, along with the
strong graduate school placement sere
vice, Grinnell students need a siren»
ger job placement service than the
Career DevelopmentOffice currently

provides. Students need more recruit-
ers on campus and more opportuni-
ties for contacts and interviews
through the ofﬁce.

Krueger‘s close friends from
school have spread across the coun~
try. He still considers Grinnellians
his best friends, keeps in contact and
visits campus periodically.

Krueger encourages current stu-
dents to “be prepared to face...very
stiff competition from other recent
graduates,“ he said. “There aremany
bright, articulate, dedicated and am-
bitious young people out there."

He also warns against arrogance
on the pan of Grinnell students be-
cause, while we receive an excellent
education, so do a lot of other stu-
dents. If Grinnell students underesti-
mate the competition and put off the
job search until too “late in the sea-
son,” the best positions will be taken.
“You have to dedicate a lot of time
and workAyou can't do this job
search half-heartedly,“ said Krueger.

 

Saint Petersburg Journal:

Tales of a Grinnell graduate in Russia

Louis Salemn, a 1991 graduate,
won a Watson Fellowship and cur-
rently lives in Saint Petersburg, Ruse
sia, working on art independentstudy
project. He responded to a question
naire about life after Grinnell.

Q: What have you been doing
since you graduated?

A: As early as March of my senior
year, I found out that] had received a
fellowship to study independently in
the Soviet Disunion fora yearfollow-
ing graduation. So, for me there were
no real surprises orfrightening transi-
tions during my ﬁrst post-Grinnell
summer. I lucked out.

I arrived in Saint Petersburg two
days after Gorbachev “returned to
power." My mission in coming here
istoinvestigate Sovietslate-indepen-
dent dance and theatre collectives.
However, life here being so fascinat-
ing in so many respects totally unrer
lated to theatre: it’s been rather diffia
cult for me to keep a narrow focus in
my outlook on these surroundings.

These first. couple months have
demanded a lot of cultural adjust-
merits, notto mention the more mun-
dane and most time-consuming ad-
justments relating to living on my
own, shopping (hunting and gather-
ing) and seeldn g out daily sustenance
in a fragile Soviet economy. These
adjustments have occupied most of
my time here to date, and only now
have I begun to tackle my fellowship
project.

Butl’m happyl’m here.Ifeel very
lucky to have the opportunity to do
something immediately after gradua-
tion that is directly related to my
major (Russian), and not just for the
sake of its matching my major, but

from off ofus

from the Tag '91
Seaﬂet and 9%th
ﬂfitor‘idStaﬂ

because my major in fact still holds
interest for me even after graduation.
Imagine that!

For me, this year is a time for
synthesizing; things I studied and inr
terests I developed at Grinnell and
elsewhere are gently colliding, tum-
bling together and pairing up like
singles at a cocktail party.

Q: Where are you living?

A: I‘m living in Saint Petersburg
in aprivate apartmenta stone’s throw
away from the Gulf of Finland. No
roommate. Not even cockroaches.

To describe the company I usually
share in my apartment, I might men-
tion the friends and relatives whose
presence I feel every day through the
display screen of my lap-top com»
puter and the e-mail correspondence
we exchange. I haven’t been this
thankful for computers since I wrote
my last term paper at Grinnell. My
LAST term paperll Doesn’t that just
sound like a point you'd expect an
alum to bring up?

Q: How well had Grinnell pre-
pared you for life after gradua-
lion?

A:Duringmy firstyearatGrinnell
a friend of my family told me this
about college: “It's not WHAT you
learn in college that’s important. but
HOW you learn.” Those words sat
well with me from the very momentI
heard them, and I used them as a
screen to filter all four years of my
GrinnellExperience(GEbringsgood
things to Life!). I think that Grinnell
prepared me very well toknow HOW
to learn in life, and how to decide for
myself what kinds of knowledge I
