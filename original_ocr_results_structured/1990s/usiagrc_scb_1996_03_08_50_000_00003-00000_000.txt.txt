March 3, 1937. students reﬂect upon a speech on the implications
of “sexual problems” given by Dr. Plass, head of the department of
obstetrics at the University of Iowa. Dr. Plass addressed birth control as
the most important issue stating, “at present in this state there is no
attempt to limitprocreation amonginmatesoiinstitutionsforthefeeble
mintled, the infirm, and those with criminal tendencies." The speaker
recommended sterilization as the most effective means of birth control
in these instances because it does not interfere with inmates' sex life,
while remaininga permanent solution to procreation. Contraceptive use
was considered another option, but was criticized tor not being as
permanent

feel that they have been discriminat-
ed against to take the necessarysteps
to rile a complaint with rhe local
police and/or the Otinnell Human
Rights Commission

Areas in which discrimination
is prohibited under the Iowa CiVil
Rights Act include: employment,
housing, public accommodations
(services or facilities provided to the
general public). and the issuance of
credit. Once a complaint has been
filed with the Commission, the
GHRC will interview both parties
involved and determine if there is
justcause, should jiistcaiise be round,
the GHRC has the ability to attempt
reconciliation throiighconflict reso«
lution or recommend legal action.

Another reason that Lipchitz
gave for the dearth of complaints is
the non-hierarchicalstructure ofthe
civilrighrsinvestigarive system, This
means that people wishing to tile a
complaint are not required to work
through local channels beiore ap.
pealing to the state or even national
level authorities. “Local people are
conscious or conﬁdentiality and at
ten go straight to the state level,"
remarked Lipchitr.

Finally. Lipchirt believes that
many people are simply unaware that
the GHRC exists. This was evident
last Fall when current SGA Presi«
dent Ed Brands. interested in pro
mOUng discussion of race related is—
sues. scheduled an informal question
and answer session for students to
meet the members of the Human
Rights Commission. To the dismay
of Lipchit: and the other Commis
sion members, “not a single person
showed up."

Along with investigating cases
of discrimination, the Commission
seelts to rake active measures to ptOr
more good will and understanding
amonglocalracial,religious,cultural
and ethnic groups. Lipchitz cited an
exampleofsuchactionthatrhe Com—
mission has been involved With in
the past.

In October of199Z, a Grinncll
College student from Pakistan was

verbally harassed and threatened by
a member of the community. The
incident was reported to the police,
and charges were brought against the
offender. A friend of the assaulted
student petitionedthemayortosee if
anything could be done about the
problems of race relations between
the town and the college. The mayor
in turn asked the Grinnell Human
Rights Commission to set up a task
force to study the problem.

Later that same month the Hair
rassment Task Force was formed
which meta total oreight times in
1993 and on February 7, 1994 pre»
sented the mayor with a lisi otnine
recommendations designed to im.
prove relations between the various
groups represented in orinnell,

One of these recommendations
was to "encourage efforts to promote
contactandcommunicationbetween
Grinnell College students and Grin-
nell High School students" and to
“support a permanent organization
of students from both groups to spew
sot events of mutual interest and
provide a forum for discussion of is—
sues of mutual concern." Lipchir:
believes that “it would be wise to
have an organization to deal with
increasing issues of diversity at the
college" which would include stu—
dentsirom the highschoolsince many
of the altercations that now occur
arebetweenhighschoolstiidents and
people from the college.

“It is our desire to try to prevent
or work toward having a strategy in
place betore incidenis occur rather
than having to present a clear thinlc.
ing response in the moment at on.
sis," said Lipchitz stating the ultir
mate goal or the Grinnell Human
Rights Commission and all at the
programs that it embraces. "wed
rather say what can we do in advance
than what could have we done in
retrospect."
