President Ferguson addresses tough questions about her

responsibilities, student power, and Grinnell’s future.

INTERVIEW CONdUCTEd by Bill MAbON

The following is from a Scarlet 8! Block interview
with President Pamela Ferguson. Sopl omt‘re Bill
Mabon met with the prerident at her house last
sunday over a breakfast at baton and eggs.

8&3: Presidentfergusan, what is Grimm"?

PF: Grinnell is and always has been about
respect and about being a place of focused
excellence. Sometimes
people will say that
"community" is what's
special about Grin-
nell... the trouble with
the word community is
that people tend to
think that community
means we’re all alike, we're all always happy,
and there's never any disagreement. That’s
not viable at a place that has exciting ideas
going on.

5&3: Does ”community” imply homogene-
ity then?

PF: No, it doesn't. But I think that "commu-
nity" conjures up, in many minds, this image
of a golden gone by era where there was never
a harsh word. I don't think that ever
existed. . .We’re not perfect, but we're not a
place that thrives on cutting someone else
down, and many other universities or liberal
arts colleges do that. So those are what I View
as the core values and those lead to becoming
a very student centered place—a college de-
voted to outstanding academics while at the
some time trying to create a sense of social
responsibility.

5&3: You see Grinnell as a student-cen-
tered college. Are you a student-centered
president?

PF: I am not the Dean ofStudents. Handseon
with students is a part ofthe job I really like,
but I spend a lot of time soliciting funds.
planning budgets, working with other admin-
istrators. I like interacting with students, and
I go to lots of events.

S&B:Areyou initiatingmanychanges from
the era afﬁnrmer president George Drake?

PF: Well, we’re constantly evolving. That's
why our curriculum is changing, that's why
we’re making an effort to get our students
ready to live in the let century, in a respon-
sible way.

5&3: Howdoes Grinnell change to prepare

”1 am not the Dean
of Studen

students for the 21st century?

er: Grinnell is in the process at changing by
curriculum changes, which are primarily by
faculty admission since it is faculty who con-
trol that, frequently pressured by student
needs...l don'tviewitas viable orappropriate
thatthe way those changes should be made is
that the President sits in her ofﬁce, thinks
great thoughts and then issues out mandates.
That Isn't how institutions work.

5813: What is your deﬁnition of multi-
Culturah'sm?

PF: Iinclude religious
diversity, intemational
students, racial and
genderand sexual pref-
erence diversity. Bydeﬁ-
nition everybodyis part
of multiculturalism.
Maybe diversity is a better word.

3&3: some students have questioned the
motives or the priority given to multi-
cuituruiism...

r ...lfyou look at the demographics, by the
year 2020, 40% of the country's population
will be composed otwhat we now consider
minorities. To some extent, to say we're going
to debate this is nonsenseslit isn’t a
choice...pragmatically it's nonsense to think
this isn't going to happen at Grinnell. You can
do itproactively or you can doit retroactively.

5&3: Do you want to see more minority
Students at Grinnell, so that it ”looks like
the future? ”

PF: Yes, but not with quotas...lt's a disservice
if we're seriously out of whack with the rest of
society. When we talk about diversity we're
also looking tor
scholat- athletes and

ers or whatever.

3&3: How does Grin-
nell attract more mi—
nority students?

PF: We have to make
sure minority students
know what a good
school we are andwhat
we’re like and what we’re not like.

5813- sn’t the issue of attracting more
minorities primarily an issueofmoney, nat
Grinneli’s reputation?

PF: No, that's a common myth. While I don't
know the average ﬁnancial aid package break-

down {at any kind of group. 20% of our
budget is spenton assisting 70% of the student
body. I think that’s a smoke screen.

sun: How important are 11.5. News and
World Report college rankings to you?

PF: They're important to me because it's how
a lot ofpeople hearabout Grinnell, especially
in regions ofthe Country where Grinnell is not
a household name. 14% of our students say
that those rankings were how they originally
heard about Grinnell. What I think is impor-
tant is that we stay on that top 25 list. Do I
have a goal that we be number 2 orsamething
like that? No, but ofcouise the highernumber

were number one, but I don’t spend hours
thinking about it.

issue of theater de—

This issue, along with
the issue of the ex-

where students have

PF: A couple at weeks
ago the theater department submitted a pro-
posal tor a new position. The executive coun-
cil is going to consider that and then make a
recommendation about whether thatisyes or
no.

5&3: And when will they be making this
decision?

PF: Right after spring breakllland I’m not
going to judge what is going to happen before
that because that's not how the system works.
And I know that that makes students real
unhappy but that's it.

5&3: You received some angry letters ﬁom

you been treated unfairly because of the
theater department expansion issue?

PF: No, Iwasn'tatthetheaterperfotmance on

5&3: So do you resent this?

PF: I don’t resent the students being angry
about the procedure by which we hire. I un-
derstand that. That goes with the position...I
felt it was an unfair assumption that Istayed
away to spite the department orbecause I was
angry...So I wrote back and expressed that.
And the great thing is that they wrote back
and said, "I’m sorry."
