Radical Chic

setting out to comfort the afflicted
and afflict the comfortable

BY BRUCE FRIEDRICH

The best books, the best essays
andarticles, the bestnovels, tliemost
effective poemsand songs, cannot be
read ivtth impunity. Literature thatis
directed toward consciousness acts
upon it, and itaccompanied by pur—
pose, talent, and lucir, it sparks the
imagination and the Will to change.

Hello. I am back at Grinnell
after a 6 1/2 year respue, I wrote to
Dan Buettner in the Fall, once it
became clear that I was going to
return to Grinnell, and asked ifI
could write a politicallyrocused col.
umn from the perspective of the {at
left. Graciously, he accepted. Addi«
tionally, as you can see by turning to
the “Features" section, 1 applied
(yeah, tight) to he “Features Editor."
Now, I have two economics semi—
nars, a theology class, and an inde—
pendent study on nonVIolence The
features 10b wrll be paying for my
books, while totally running me
down. But I wouldn't have taken it if
I didn‘t think it would be fun.

Window Locked I’ve been thinking...

BY DAN BUETTNER

I‘m back as editor ofthe Scarlet

about taking the Job again this se—
mester. ldon't mean towhine about
how hard it is to do my Job—far from
it. I actually enjoy this yob. even
though it requires me to keep some
pretty strange hours. What irks me
are the expectations my professors
have that at the same time 1 get my
reading done tor their classes. How
annoying. Anautomatic‘A' inevery
class seems like a much more reason/
able proposition to me.

speaking or reading. the rust
day of my semester started on an
awfully depressing note when I went
to purchase my textbooks. I held the
bookstore record for the semester With
31 books. totalling $434.86, until I
panicked and dropped a class (“‘0

But I’d like to get back to the

BY ERIN MCCORMALLY

This past Sunday, I, like many
orinnellians, piled into my hall
lounge to wuich super Bowl XXX.
Though I watch the game every year,
Idon’tusuallypaymuch attentionto
the regular season, and subsequently
don't really have a favorite team.
This leaves me free to root for which»
ever team seems the least obnoxious.
My chosen team might not wm, but
there‘s a minute amount ofsatisfac—
[Ion to be derived from cheering on
the underdog. Due to sortie bitarre
supernatural force I always end up
reeling likesuch a girl when I watch
football on TV. Now I know that
women are as athletic as men, and
just as competitive I personally be»
lieve that girls should be allowed to
play any sport they choose. Howey.
er, since i myself have never been
inclined to participate in any sport
that cannot be played in my back—
yard, 1 occasionally feel like an out.
sider among more ardent sports eir
thusiasts/participants.

still. watching the super Bowl
stands out in my mind as a traditional
event for my family. That Sunday
was one ofthe few days ofthe ycar I
could sit with my dad and brothers,
genuinely-reelinglikconeottheguys.
On that day they would patiently
explain, yei again, what a sarciy is,
and I'd retrain (min making typically
girir comments like, "oooh, hc's
tiiic hiyyounge.sisiershayen'iytt
realized that this really annoys my
brothers I think they’re afraid that
observations of that sort might dis<
tract the players tram their unques.
tionably masculine task

Minotsquabbles aside, I remein

bet those Sundays With great fond«
ness. Mymomwoiild makeabig, and
I mean BIG, kettle of chili and we
kids would all sit around and repeat»
edly ask mydad questions like, "Who
do you want to wini", and, “Which
team is in red and goldl”. My mom
knew all this cool stuff too, but it
always seemed more appropriate to
risk my dad. Isuspect because he held
the beer nuts we craved.

it suddenly occurred to me this
past super Bowl Sunday that I've leit
those good ol‘ days behind and now
share many slmilarexperiences with
new people, namely my dorm-mares
i know it sounds corny, but i really
feel that it's things like nioyie nights
and Super Bowl parties, much more
than anything a smaller group ofin»
divrduals have in common, that can
hmd a dorm together, even for just a
short time, it's during such inter.
iudes that we stop worrying for a
little that we’re such and such ma«
,ors, and be ourselves. Sometimes l
forget that I‘m not just a faceless
college student. but a person. one
who enjoys the company ofherfanr
iiy offcllow students, Last Sunday I
had fun hanging out with folks in
Homes (e\ en the ones who were iusr
waiting for “Ftlencls”), I| was beauti.
iuliy uncomplicated, and I‘ll iry hard
to remember come finals week that it
isstiil possible lot mt totnyoysimple
plcusurcs

On Sunday I watched large men
pass around a brown mal ball, and
from time to time “squish” each 0th»
er it was a good game enioyed in

ers was really cute
