Washburn on unfasht'onable generics

 

COMMON
SENSE

by Mike Washburn

 

 

 

Michael Levin, a professor at
the City University of New York,
knows the consequences ofpolitical
incorrectness. His unfashionable
work on genetics has incurred angry
demonstrationsoutsidehisofﬁeeand
loud demands for his dismissal.

On hearing of the uproar, one
might wonder if Levtn has become
an honorary member of the Ku Klux
Klan, but that isn’t the case. Levin, a
geneticist, has suggested that there
mi ghtbe genetic reasons for the cone
sistent failure of blacks to perform as
well as whitw on intelligence tests.
His suggestion, while interesting, is
entirely irrelevant to politics, and
those who have assigned it political
moment are fools. But more impor»
tantly, the attack on Levin gives the
lie to the often~heard boast aboutour
“frccandopcnsociety,”andissympr

tomatic ofan ailing intellectual cul»
ture.

Some people seem to have de—
sided that promoting the “self-es-
teem” of cenairt minority groups is
more imponant than intellectual in-
tegrlty. The notions being advanced
by the multiculturallsts, if not yet by
the public schoolteachers, are that
only whites are guilty ofslavery, that
black Africa is in many ways supe-
rior to the west, that its flaws are due
to European imperialism, that an»
eient Egypt was black.

These notions are absurd to a
comical degree. We will not belittle
the horror of European slavery by
reminding ourselves that from the
eleventh century onwards, slavery
was one of the principal features of
black African societies, and thatEuA
ropeans could not have adopted sla-
very with such easewithoutthercady
assistance of the leaders of these so
eieties. The black despots figured
that the weapons they could obtain
from Europeans in exchange for
slaves would facilitate theirown eon-
quest of other blacks and acquisition

EDITORIAL
No apology necessary

What a miserable day it is when we are expected to offer apologies for
raising issues. While the students responsible for the “Black Enough“ cards
have apologized profusely and confessed their crimes, we maintain that they
had nothing to apologize for. If their actions caused pain for a few people.
then that is unfortunate, but never should it be assumed that issues critical to
a community‘s well-being will be painless to discuss.

Daun'ce Coaster has been threatened with Judicial Council acrion. She
has been told that she must atone for the emotional suffering ofthe “victims”
ofthe card campaign. We consider this to be wholly ridiculous. Perhaps the
cards were not the best method of drawing people’s attention to these issues
of identity and division. but that is beside the point at this juncture. Those
people who reacted so negatively and hostiley to the cards focused too much
on the method and too little on the issue. If people at this college would spend
half the energy on discussing solutions to problems that they spend contemr
plating how they are going to duck issues or sue someone for giving offense,
we might really get some things done here.

Even if the method used by the “Black Enough" propagandists was not
finally effective, we believe that they were entirely justiﬁed in trying to raise
issues on this campus. While they have taken an apologetic tone, we stand
firm. This newspaperwill raise troublesome issues from time to time and we

will not apologize for it

They didn’t pick up such habits
from the Europeans. In Paul
Johnson’s book Thz Birth of the
Modern we learn of the nineteenth
century black dictator Chaka, who,
without havtng been inﬂuenced by
Europeans,notonlymassacredblacks
who were outside his tribe but orgar
nlzcd death squads and instructed
them tokjllrealor imagitledpolitieal
rivals wrthin it (Johnson, p. 239).
Slavery, furthermore, started in these
societies centuries before the first
European contact with them.

And what is the state of black
Africa now? Is it prosperous? Three
of its largest countries—4Cllad, So-
malia,ttndEthiopia~havepcrcaplta
incomes among the lowest in the
world. ls it free ofmcism? Not in the
eyes of the Chinese workers who.
simply because of their race, were
deported from thcrcgioniu the 19605.
ls itdelnoeratic? Yes, almostiany-
body who can stage a coup d’etat can
get political power.

The support of some feminists for
Afroeentrism is bewildering when
when considers that if these women
were living in subrSaharan Africa,
they would be stripped of political
rights and their clitorises cut off.
Outside of the western world, in fact,
there are very few cultures thatenter—
Iainoureccentricnotionsaboutequal-
ity between the sexes and races.

Faced with the facts of black Af-
rica, liberals readily employ the fac-
ile excuse of European imperialism.
It is a false excuse. Under the Euro-
peansblaekAfrieabecameoneofthe
mostproductiveregionsin the world.
capable not only of feeding itself but

also of supplying Europe with food.
Today the region is marked by fam-
ine, and a principal reason is black
incompetence. As James Bumham
writes in Suicide of the Wen, the
British in Kenya took great pains to
develop superior farms, which the
blacks took over as soon as
decolonization was complete. And,
as Bumham notes, their takeover by
the blacks happened to coincide with
the start of their swift decline.

Butthc public sehoolsarebeginr
ning to dissemble these facts—we
don’t want to give black students the
wrongopinionofthemselves.dowe?
Let‘s just tell them lhatall their prob
lems, and all the problems of their
ancestors, have resulted from white
racism. Maybe we should throw in
some mythology about the black ori-
gins of western thought.

This latter notion amuses me to no
end. If the ideas that inspired western
civilization did indeed come from
blacks,then one wonders whyasimir
lar civilization did not emergeﬁstill
has not emergedianywhere in black
Africa. An idea can be plagiarized: it
cannot be removed. If Salieri had
borrowed from Mozart, that would
not have made Momrt a different
composer, or a less great one.

Certainly, it is possible that Levin
is a man of negligible talents who,
knowing that his talents will not get
him attention, hopes to get it by being
shocking. And there is that danger
thathiseffusionswillbeexploitedby
hate-mongers. Still, one cannot but
deplore the attacks on him by a fac-
tion whose own doctrine is about as
close to the truth as KKK propa-
ganda.

Letter to the Editor...

Public Apology

To the editor:

Those of us involved in the pro—
paganda surrounding the issue of
identity wishtoextendasineereapolr
ogy to those who received “Black
Enough" or “‘Almost’ Black
Enough” cards directly and anyone
else who subsequently feltemou'onal
pain and alienation.

The intent of thepropaganda was
to raise the imponant issue of how
identity plays a role in a a commu
nity, to raise awareness and to facili-
tate positive dialogueand the sharing
of perspectives on this issue.

We do not attempt to diminish
the hurt caused by the cards, but we
do stand on the fact that the intent
was not malicious. Those involved
empatieally state that the propaganda
didnotinvolveConeernedBlackStu-
dents in its formulation or execution.
Those involved identify themselves
acting as independent students and
CBS should not be implicated in any
way. The ideas reflected in the pro-
paganda only reflectthe ideas of those
directly involved.

Although the African American
community was targeted by the pro-
paganda, this community is not be
held accountable as a group for ex-
planations and consequences sur-
rounding this issue.

Again, we apologize for the any
pain we have caused and aelcnowl~
edge the inappropriateness of the pro-
paganda.

Hey! The Greeks don’t want no Freaks!

by Konstantinos
Kambouroglou

It'sthe middle of Septemberand
the presidential elections are near, If
you take a walk around the dorms
and the parking lots, you are sure to
see loads of Clinton/Gore (and sig
nificantly lessBush/Quayle) stickers
and posters. So the elections for the
42nd President of the United States
of America are approaching, Well
what does this mean? For Americans
a lot; or nothing: or something in
between. For the rest of the world?
Good question indeed! Of course, I
couldn‘t possibly speak for every-
body in the world outside the US, but
I can‘t help myself giving one pos-
sible Greek interpretation of the whole
story.

(Note: It would take a poli-sci
analysis of recent GrecoAmerican
relations, in order to help readers
comprehend the reasons for my in
terpretation Ihereby offer, buta polir
sci major I am not. So, I guess I will
have to proceed without further in-
troduction, hoping that everybody
will get something out of this.)

Mr. George Bush is the current
president of the United States of

America. Yeah, that tall guy who
was a spoiled rich kid and went to
that famous university. Aha, the guy
who signed those promising and
funky deals with Gorby. (Pour old
Gorby, whatever happened to him
anyway?) So. what else does he do?
Oh, he is the one whocame to Greece
last year and the they stopped the
uaffie in Athensjust to get him from
theairporttothe parliament. Andhis
limo was speeding too. I70 km/hr
(that’s well over 100 m/hrl) And
why all this? Just to get the bastard
there safe. As if anybody would care
to kill him. And if they did, would
they be so stupid to do it in Athens?
They’d do it somewhere else, criter-
wise the Americans might send out
for us; like they sent for Saddam.
Yeah right! I hear Bush organized
the whole Gulf War deal because his
fatnily had oil-business interests in
the area. You see, he’s from
Whachamacallit, Texas. That place
with the cowboys and the oil drills.
Yup, that's who George Bush is.
And what’s the other one’s
name? Bill Clinton. Yes. I don't
know who the hell this guy is. I hear
that he’s from the other party. The
Democrats. Well, I ask, if they are
the democrats, what are the other

guys? The fascists? They probably
are too. I don’t know. What’s the
difference anyway? Theyall seem to
be the same to me. Say, who was in
powerwhen the American-supported
Junta was imposed in Greece? Who
was in power during the Vietnam
war? Who screwed up in Panama
and Cambodia and so on? 1 don’t
know. All I know is that there have
been changes in the American gov
emment

But there just haven’t been any
changes. I think lhatnot even Ameriv
cans themselves know what the dif-
ference between the Democrats and
the OtherGuys is. All they talkabout
in their preveleetion campaigns is
abortion and taxes. Oh, and how
they're going to mess around with
othercounn-ies’ affairs “for the com-
mon good."

Oh well, the deal is that there’s
going to be an election in America. I
guess this meansparty forsome, party
for others and maybe nothing for the
innocent rest.

Yup, all this sounds like crap to
metoo. (Well,um.,.Dukakissounded
good. The boy was Greek. And so
wasTsongas. Now whatin theworld
happened to those guys?)
