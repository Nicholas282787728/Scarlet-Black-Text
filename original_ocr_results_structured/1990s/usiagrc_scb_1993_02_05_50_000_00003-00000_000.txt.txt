First Amendment Symposium
Delgado on Hate Speech: Not Justified

y Aida Rutlova

PEECl-l is the primary tneans
S by which we construct social

reality.” In the last night of
the symposium on “First Amcndr
tnentIssues,"RichardDelgado,Pro-
fessor of Law at the Universny of
Washington, stressed the point that
hate speech is the means by which
society creates a stigma around cer-
tain groups. This form of speech
attempts to crush the spirit of a
people in a country whose entire
phllusuph) is based on the potion ol
equality. Racist speech is especially

prevalent in campuses all over the
U.S., according to Professor
Delgado.

People’s reaction to hate speech.
stated ProfessorDelgado,is typically
dealt With from two frames of refer-
ence or paradigms: the defenders of
the First Amendment constitute one
paradigm, the defenders of equality
constitute the other, The argument
held by the former group is ihatcert
sorshtp is not the solution to over-
coming racistspeech. Thefear is tiiat
ofa domino effectwncccensorship
begins, where does it stop‘.7 They
argue thtttprotectirlguperson'srigltt
of speeclt is essential in a society that

is “prone to striking this value...
away,” The argument of the latter
group is that institutions, such as
collegesanduniversities.shouldhave
the power to protect the equality of
all individuals. They regard defend-
ers of the First Amendment as scekr
ing to destroy the value of equality,
the most imponant value to preserve
in their opinion.

According to Professor Delgado,
there needs to be “a balance" be»
tween these seemingly opposing
points of view. Each side Wants the
balance to shift its way and neither is
willingtocotnpromise—thtstswhere
theconfhctliesTheseparadigmsarc

reﬂections of a legal system which
values both freedom and community
and yet are afraid of both, said
Delgado. Free speech is a useful
weapon for the dominant group in a
society. Tile words of the dominant
group ofa society are accepted while
the words of other groups in rebuttal
to the arguments of the dominant
grouplosetheireffectivenesanlight
of this fact, hate speech must be
viewed differently than other forms
of speech and thus must notbe subi
jeet to protection, stressed Delgado.
Hate speech is different in that it
normalizes a shared cultural stereo-
type of a group of people,

A Woman’s Perspective

Rlva Sharples

OST feminists agree that
Demography sets us on a
high threshold for tolerr

ance of abuse and harm to women,"
said Jean Stefancic. She talked of
pornography, and about the different
and sometimes dividing forces in the
feminist movement.

“There are basically three ap—
proaches in feminist jurisprudence:
the different voice approach, the

dominance theory, and the formal
equality theory. These theories are
vastly different and have caused a
splitinthefeministmovcment,make
ing the movement harder to be
heard."

The formal equality theory is the
theory most embodied in laws, said
Stefancic. According to this theory,
women are permitted to compete
equally with men on the economic
frontandmenareencouragedtocom-
pete with women on the domestic
front. The problem with this theory,

according to some feminists, is that
current society can never be fully
sex-blind and therefore, nothing will
ever be completely unbiased and
equal, she said.

The most controversial of the
threetheoriesisthedominancetheory.
saidStefaricici “Believers of the domir
nance theory profess that women are
dominated by sexual attitudes, such
as sexual harrassment. The problem
with this theory is that lesbians and
women of color do not feel that they
fit in to this deﬁnition very well."

Each theory in feminist jurispru-
dence looks at pornography in a
slightly different light This split in
the movement should be overlooked
and everyone should work together,
said Stefancic.

"it should be remembered that
gender problems, pornography,
abuse, etc. are problems of society.
notjust of women," she said.

Stefaneic'sparting messagecene
tered on the need for humans to unite
and work together
