Racism: It can
happen here

On February 19m, a Crime” College International student was a

Victim of yet another blatantly racist crime, an attack by two unidenufted
men. The men assaulted the student for no reason other than “he looked
Arab." The white American student who was accompanying him was not
threatened in any way. Police are calling it a “hate crime".
At a workshop given Tuesday by the Ofﬁce of Multicultural Affairs,
speakerAiiRashad Umranidefined
racrsm as “the holding ofmisinfor»
mation.” The actions of these men
showed a negative aspect of the
current Persian Gulf Crisis— that
Lhere are Americans who have be-
come misinformed that all Arabs
are associated with the ideology of Saddam Hussein.

The fact that the attack was perpetuated by members of the Grinncll
community, not the campus, is notimportant. Whatis important is that we
acknowledge that a racist attack comes from a developmental problem,
that many Americans are now condemning an entire people for the actions
of one man.

A collcgcsuch as Grinnell, which has a large international contingent,
is sadly vulnerable to such incidents. It is the responsibility of the entire
campus community to condemn this type of incident and to work against
its recurrence. l

The townofGrlnncllobvtously needs tobecome betterinfonncd ofour
concerns. No Grinnell student should be saying to her or himself, “I’ll
never feel safe in Grinnell again," and more should be done than just
“walking in pairs," as Grinnell Police ChiefDan Boyer suggests. A great
deal of responsibility rests with us.

The students ofGrtnnell College mustset an example ofopcn-minded
behaviorand combat theracrstgeneralizatton oflumping all Arabs, orany
otherrace, intooneentityand blaming them for the actionsofa fewoftheir

people.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Student denounces
alternative paper

To the editor.

Yesterday as I walked out of the
post office I was suddenly uansr
ported to an altcmatcreality, a place
where sexist, racist bigots ruled the
land (two evil "fists" in that sen-
tence). l was not taking dangerous
drugs, nor was this the plot to last
week’s Captain America comic
book. I hadjust picked up the first
issue of the CamptLrSpL't‘lamr. [was
both surprised and horriflcd at this
recent publication. 1 was horrified
that the staff of editors could so
callously attack everybody on
campus who is not white, Anglo
Saxon. heterosexual, well-shave",
male, ultra-conservative, American
and literate. I was also horriﬁed by
the fact that the paper is even loosely
affiliated with the Campus Repub-
licans. Last time I checked. the
Republican Party did not endorse

bigotry and harassment. Ifl were a
Republican, [would avoid thistoilet
paper as if it were a rabid moose.

Although I was justly disgusted
at the Campus Spittoon. 1 am not of
the opinion that. the papershouldbe
banned in any fashion. Iam an avid
believer in freedom of speech and
therefore cannot endorse the de-
struction of the paper. However,l
do feel that it is important to scoff
at, burn, laugh at and make paper
airplanes outof this trash. I will use
this rag to strengthen my resolve in
what I believe in, for most of the
arguments brought up in its pages
are so ludicrous that one would
have to be blind not to disagree.

Basically, 1 view this paper as a
joke and an insult to anyone of
intelligence, liberal or not. The
Campus Splattemr does have one
saving grace, however; at least it is
recyclable.

Memorials, not mockeries

To the editor,

lam writing in response to the
staff editorial in last Week’s issue
and the comments that were made
at the speak out last Thursday in
oppositiontoPGA'sDayofSilence,
which included placing fake
tombstones on Central Campus.
While I cannot speak for each in-
dividualwhochoseIoparticipatein
this action, [can firmly say that my
intention was never to prophesy the
deaths of American soldiers, let
alone the deaths of frtends and
relatives of Grinnell students. My
intention was to mount the tens of
thousands of deaths that have al-

ready occurred as a mutt of this
war. My tombstone, which was
speciﬁcally criticized in the speak
out, stated that if Grinnell had lif-
teen times as many students and
enchfllledoutalombstone.ilwould
equal the amount of deaths in this
war. Sadly, all those pcoplealready
have real tombstones. They are not
coming back. .

Iamopposedtothiswarbecause
Ido not want anyone's relatives to
die anymore, be they American,
Kuwaiti or Iraqi. I don’t want to
ever have to have another day to
mourn them and represent lhemwith
“fake“ tombstones.

Deﬁnition, please?

To the editor,

Ndileka Mbalo and Tandcka
Stanbackbothfallvictimtoacom-
men (or convenient) misconcep-
tion: that anti-Semitism does not
equal hatred or discrimination
against Jews. The 1984 Webster':
IINeth'verrt‘deDictianarydel'tnes
anti-Setnite as (and this is the
complete definition): “noun. A
person hostile towards Jews. 7
anti’rSermit'ic adj.7an’ti-Sem‘l-
tism.”

Regardless of the dictionary
definition, atlli-Somitism IS the
term solely used to describe dis
critttlnduona: instle\\'s.AnLtrArltb
activities are referred to us “Arab

discrimination," even though both
Arabs and Jews are cliusificd as
“Semites.”

Itis clearthatFanakhanzlndhis
supporters are anti~Semites.
Farrakhan proclaimed Hider,aman
responsible for the death of six
million people solely because of
d1eir]ewishreligion,“agreatman."
Farrakhan also called Judaism a
“gutterrcligion.”

As long as Farrakhan and his
fascist supporters practice mctsm
and anli-Semitism, they will never
be worthy of the respect of the
American public.

Housing
Committee
clarifies
position

To the editor,

The members of the Housing
Committeeareconcemedabeutthe
number of rumors circulating
campusregardingdteestablishment
of permanent language houses.
Speciﬁcally, these rumors are:

t) that the committee has decided
to designate six to seven permanent
languagehouses,leavingonlythree
ouses for the rest of the college
community; and

2) that the committee has decided
to designate two to three such
houses.

Because of these rumors, the
committee wishes to publish this
statement, thereby clarifying our
stance on this issue.

First of all. the Housing Comr
mittee is an advisory committee, It
has the power to recommend
changes in housing policy to the
president of the college. not to in-
stitute policy changes (see pages
105-7 ofthoStudentHandbook). It

Where are the
table tents?

To the editor,

What ever happened to table
tents? Some of you may not be
aware that Dining Services has of-
ﬁcially announced, as of this se-
mester, there will be no more table
tents. It appears that the Service
Bureauwasunawareofthischange,
because as of last week, they were
still accepting orders to print them.

I feel compelled to write this
letter about table tents for three
reasons. First, because of the com-
plete lack of communication on
Dining Services’ part to convey the
message of the abolishmenl of the
table tents. Second, because I feel
table tents are an excellent form of
communication Lastofall,beeause
of the insensit ty on Dining Ser-
vices’ part in not utilizing any stu-
dent input in the decision process.

After learning that table tents
were no longer being used, 1 im-
mediately talked with Dave
McConnell to discern the reason-
ing behind the decision. I also was
curious ‘dS to why it had not been
comtlluntcalcd to the SCYVICC Bun
