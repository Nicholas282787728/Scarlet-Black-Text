Performing Arts Film:

The Wild One
Thursday, December 1, 9:15 p.771”
Harris Cinema (79 min. 1

The Wild One, based on an ace
tual event and made four years after
The Bicycle Thief, is an example of
the evolution of Necheallsm in the
United States, as well as an important
movie in Marlon Brando’s early ca-

reer. Brando and Lee Marvin play
the leaders of rival Ieatherjacketed
motorcycle gangs that terrorize a
small town. The film is extremely
powerful in both its mood and impli—
cations for society. Director Laslo
Benedict uses character, emotion and
contrasts of light and darkness to
create atmosphere, much as Elia
Kazan did in an Ilte Walerfrortl and
De Sica did in The Bicycle Thief.

Cultural Arts Film:

Thenrem, Teorema
Friday and Saturday It! 8. 00 p,lll.,
Sunday at 2:00 [1,III,, ARH 302

Among the first films to present
homosexuality as equal to heteroe
sexuality, Theorem, Teorema detoe
nated a violent controversy when it
appeared, At Venice in 1968 it was
awarded the prize of the Catholic
InternationalFilmOfﬁce,whilemany
Catholics, including the Pope him-

self denounced it as “21 Black Mass
with Freud and Marx as assistant
celebi-ants." With very terse dia-
logue and plot, Pasolini depicts the
members ofa bourgeois Italian fame
lly whose lives are transformed by
the Visitor, a mysterious house guest
who may be God, the Devil, or both.
Gentleness,understanding andsexual
openness mark the Visitor’s actions
as he responds to the hidden desires
of his hosts.

Inthetraditlon of”TheFu-m"
and “The Pelican Brief," this is
another great movie based on a
John Grisham noveli This one‘s
also abouta lawyer, but this time,
It’s Susan Sarandon, and she’s
been hired by a boy who is run-
ning from the mob and the police
after he and his little brother wit-
nessed a little too much. Pretty
true to the book, this is a good
movie with an added attraction of
suspense.

Kevin Costnerheads the star
studded cast of this Chicago
gangster movie as the fearless
Treasury agent Eliot Ness who
battles underworld crime and
police corruption in Chicago.
Brian de Palmadirected this 1987
movie, and Robert de Niro and
Sean Connery also star. Although
I can’t give you a personal testi-
mony, this movie has been
heavily endorsed by, among oth
ers, senior Jim Kropa who come
merited on the ”interesting movie
score"andJunloanan Day,who
said,“thismoviechangedmyiife
somuchthatafterIsawit,mylife

(or something like that). Go see

According to Lisa
Alexander, SGA Films Chair, in
this movie, “Dennis Leary is a
jewel thicl' on the run who kid-
naps a family on Christmas Eve,
and Leary finds himself at the
mercy ofa dysfunctional family
who is using Christmas dinner to
vent their frustrations. The kid
napper soon becomes a hostage
trapped in the middle ofa family
feud. This movie is hilarious
even if you don’t like Dennis
Leary."
