Every keg has a
silver lining

The closure of the bar has left the student body with a feeling
vacuous despair. Although a bit on the seedy side, the bar was the
only dive that students could call their own, It served as an
alternative to routine campus gatherings, adding an element of
wordly camussing to the daily experience of provincial normality.

But perh ps the passing of the bar signals a renaissance of
campus acti ties.

Since the demise of the bar, a veritable convoy of kegs has
stretched from McNally's to various destinations around campus.
Recently, a "roller ball“ party was sponsored to add excitement to
the standard Harris shindig. Even
more promising is the rebirth of
Smith Wednesdays.

After a semester which many
characterized as "tough," perhaps
it is beneﬁcial to enhance came
pus activities This doesn't nec-
essatily denote alcoholic consumption. but simply an intensiﬁcar
tion of already extant functions. After observing the initial parties
of the semester, it appears this is happening.

Somecontend thatsince Harrisparties have no competition from
the bar, the quality will ultimately decrease Realistically, however,
Harris parties were never really competing with the bar. But the
bar‘s absence does dramatically affect the success of Harris parties.
Since people are willing to attend more often and longer, the parties
automatically become successful.

The bar will clearly be missed by most students. Yet its exit has
a silver lining. It allows and ailing campus to lick its wounds

Perhaps the bar will reopen some day. Students know the
economic power they hold. But until then. try to intensify what we

already have,

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Protest of Alcohol and Student
Drug survey unfounded questions

To the Editor,

In the last issue of the S and B
several students wrote a letter com-
plaining about the way the Alcohol
and Drug survey was conducted. Their
main complaint was the fact that one
of the questions of the survey showed
adelibemte insensitivity towards gays
and lesbians by inferring that one
would drink alcohol to feel comfort
able with members of the opposite
sex.Now, let‘enot go overboard here,
It is true that the gay and lesbian
group should be recognized in our
community, but is it reasonable to be
calling a survey a heterosexist piece
of trash just because the audtor forgot
to take into consideration gays and
lesbians in one of the survey ques-
tions? I don’t have reason to believe
that Jennifer Krohn, or any others
responsible for writing the survey,
have any particular prejudice against
gays or lesbians, so let‘s stop the nitty
picky, militant attitudes. shall we?
Relax, have a beer, and stop com-
plaining. I don‘tknow ifmany people
realize how difficult it is to conduct a
survey that is sensitive to die ideolor
gies, tastes. and backrounds of an
entirecarnpuscommunity,especially
of the Grinnell community.

In another passage these students
went on to say that one survey ques-
tiondidn‘ttakeintoaccounttheexist-
ence of homosexual families by in

quiring about one‘s mother’s and
father's drinking habits. Did it ever
occur to them that the authors of the
survey could be trying to find a gee
netic relationship, between one’s
drinking habits and thoseof his or her
natural parents? Everyone has, or has
had a natural mother and a natural
father, haven’t they? They wouldn’t
be alive if they didn’t.

When you think of it, what about
those whose parents divorced, and
who only lived with one parent, or
those who have suffered the loss of
both parents? You could also say that
the administration refused to recog-
nize them, couldn’t you? It didn’t
take them into account, and yet, you
don‘t see them writing rabid protest
letters, and running aroung trying to
getpeople to not answer thesurvcy. If
ever the results of this survey are
inconclusive, I hope that all those
who refused to turn it in are happy
with whattheydid.Goodjobfellows

Sincerely Yours.
