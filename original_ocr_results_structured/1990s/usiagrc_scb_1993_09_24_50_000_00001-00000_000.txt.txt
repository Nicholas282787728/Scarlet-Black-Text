shuttle running from Grinr
nell to the Williamsburg

A Outlet Mall and to the Uni-

ersity of Iowa campus began on
September 18. The release from me
Iffiee of the Vice-President of SGA
states that the shuttle will be run “in
rder to provide students access to
esources in larger communities.”
Monica Horton, SGA Vice-
President, did extensive research on
the shuttle idea before discussing it
with Student Affairs. ”the shuttle
had been in service before," noted
Horton. ”About8 years ago, itran to
IowaCityr TheBurlinglibrarian also
operated a shuttle service to the Uni

versity of low) library. However,

that service stopped operating about i

4 years ago when the library joined
INTERNET. Sineetheshuttle was in
operation beiore,1 knew a little work
could get the servree going again.”

Horton talked toTom Crady who
was responsive to the idea. “For
students withoutcars,theshuttle gives
them theopportunity touse the facili-
ties at the University of Iowa. It
operates at a minimal cost to stu-
dents, and no profit is made by either
SGA orthecollege,”stressetlHorton.

The shuttle leaves every Suture
day morning at 10:30 am. from the
Forum. It will arrive at Grinnell at
5:30 pm. The cost is $6.00 per
person. Ttekets may be purchased at
