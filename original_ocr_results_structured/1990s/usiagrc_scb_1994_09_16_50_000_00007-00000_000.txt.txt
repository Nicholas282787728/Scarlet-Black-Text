Grad cases into real world through Grinnell

By MARK HUANG
Staff Writer

INDING a job after gradua
F tion is a worry that plagues

everystudenthereatGrinncll.
Ask almostany senior what they will
bedoingaftertheendofthis yeararid
they will probably respond with a
shrugand thephrase,“l don'tknow."
Not so for Erik Brandenburg, who
graduated Iastspr'ingandtonightwitr
nesses his first opening night in pro-
fessional theatreas a scenic designer.

Born and raised in Downer’s
Grove, a Chicago suburb.
Brandenburg had little theatre expe-
rience in high school. His school
choirperformedamusicaleveryyear,
and one time when some friends of
his did a children‘s theatre produc4
tion of The Wizard Of 0:, Erik was
the Tin Man. When he arrived at
Grinnell, he had no plans to pursue a
career in theatre, however. another
friend here asked him to run the light
board for a production and he has
been hooked ever since,

Although Brandenburg received
his bachelor’s degree in math, hewas
abletotakefivetheatrecourseswhile
attending school, work as an electri-
clan and carpenter in the college’s
scene shop, as well as act as the stage
manager for several theatre produc-
tions. Further experience was gained
outside of the school’s environment
throughasummerintemshipatlowa
Public Television as an assistant to
the graphic artist and a job as the
slage manager for The Swan, a show
produced at the Riverside TheaI-w,

the professional theatre in Iowa City,
This last summer he spent here in

Grinnell helping to install Roberts
Theatre’s new lighting system.

It was during this summer that
he was approached about using his
setdcsign forDancing AlLilghMSll,
the second most recent play by Brian
Friel who authored last year's pro»
duction ofTranrlrztions. Last semes-
terBrandenburgtookAdvancedStage
DCSlgn,af|dﬂSpaIlOtheﬁnalprOJcCl
for the class, had designed the set for
theplayasifitwastobepcrformedat
the Riverside Theatre. Professor
Alexanders. Moffctt, who ison sab-
batical this semester and is currently
directing the play at the Riverside
Theatre, came in for the final critique
of theclass' work. Moffett,impress<x1
by Brandenburg’s design, made the
decision to hire him. Assistant Pror
fessor Philippa Gordon served as
Brandenburg’s scenic advisor, and

he asserts that if it hadn‘t been for
her, it would not have happened at
all. “While it’sstill mydesign,itwas
Pip (Gordon) who pointed out all of
the little details that were necessary
togetitdoneeorroctlyr This has been
a very big learning experience."
Gordon is also the lighting deSigner
for this production; lowa City sound
designer Mark Bruckner, who de-
signed the sound for our productions
of Machinal, Beckett Shorts and In
the Heart Of America is designing
thesound,andGrinnellresidentCindy
Abcl is designing the costumes.

Taking Brandenburg’s original
design, he and Pip worked out prob»
lems thul wore in it and created an
artistic and functional design from
which Brandenburg, resident techni-
cal director Erik Sanning, the theatre
student slaff and the Introduction to
Stagecrait class built the first two
weeks of the semester. The River-
side Theatre hired Grinnell to build
the set and both Brandenburg and
Moffctl feel that it was wise to do so
here. Moffctl felt that it was a good
process for the stagecrait class to
build the set for a space not on cam
pus, then watch its transformation as
it was trucked to Iowa City and set up
there. Instructor of the stagecraft
class Gordon agrees, pointing out
that staning the semester by immedi-
atcly building a set helps the class
seize onto what theatre is real ly about
behind the scenes, as well as giving
them enthusiasm to carry them into
the semester.

Brandenburg‘s duties increased
when he was asked to stage manage
the show, too, And while it has been
a lotof work for him and sometimes
he has wondered how he let himself
get involved so heavily, he is very
pleased wtth how it is going along
and doesn’tbegrudge itone bit. “The
company (in Iowa City) is just mar-
velous.” Although someofthe actors
are only giaduate students, they have
all been very professional and help-
ful, and through the development of
this production Brandenburg has gotr
ten close to them and theircharactcrs.

This is fortunate, as theaudience
must fall in love with the characters
ofDancing Al Lughrtam in order to
enjoy the play, The play takes place
in Ireland in 1936 and is the reflecr

asking Volunteers
to teach CCD of
Si. Mary's Church.

Knowing that every performance
of every production will be different,
Mot‘iett’s direction has stressed the
inner beauty and stage pictures,and he
feels diatBi-andenburg'ssethas worked
well tocomplimentlhis. Theplay will
be mnning for fourconsecutivc week~
ends, and posters and llyers listing the
location, times and prices of each per»
fomianccarc available in the FincArts
ofﬁce.

Brandenburg has really appreci-
ated this final experience here at
Grinnell. “It’s nice to say good-bye
to Grinnell, to ease out." But when

this play finishes its run, he will still
be busy. In early October he will be
leaving the Midwest for Seattle,
Washington, where he will be living
with two other Grinnell graduates
and interning atthe Seattle Repertory
in stage managing. During a four
mainstageproductionseason,hewill
be Assistant Stage Manager for the
second and fourth mainstage produc-
tions, as well as working on two of
the second stage productions.
Brandenburg says he looks forward
towards his move to a part of the
counuy that he has never been to
before and hopes to stay awhile if
work continues to be good. With a
history like his, he shouldn’t worryr

Friday at 7:30 pm, Sunday at
3:00 p.m., Harri: Cinema
Based on the true story of the
romance between recluse novelist
CS. Lewis and Joy Davidson, this
movie is a real tear-jerker. The
unlikely friendship of a young
American mother and an old Enr
glish professor/novelist leads to
love. Unexpected tragedy befalls
the couple, and the audience is
pressed for Kleenexes when even
the excellent Anthony Hopkins
himself (playing CS. Lewis) fi-
nally breaks down. This movie is
for romantics and those ready fora
sappy,poignant,yettriielovesiory.
