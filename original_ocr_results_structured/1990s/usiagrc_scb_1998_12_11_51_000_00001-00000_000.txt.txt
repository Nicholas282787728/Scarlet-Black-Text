Grinnell State Bank has announced
a310,000 contribution toward the Grin~
nellAreaRecreationTrail, whichplun-
nets hope will eventually create a loop
for bicyclists, joggers and others tlrat
will link the city with Rock Creek
State Park and the Jacob Krumm Nar
ture Preserve in neighboring Jasper
County.

The bank‘s contribution means that
the effort has met a requirement to
raise $36,000 in local matching funds
inordertoensurereceiptofaS148,000
grant administered by the Iowa De
partment of Transportation. ‘

The Grinnell Area Recreation Trail
(GART) is a project spearheaded by
the Grinnell 2000 Foundation Accord-
ing to Deb Collum-Calderwood, the
foundation's executive director, Grin-
nell State’s commitment means that
the $36,000requirernent has nowbeen
exceeded.

Donations all private
‘ All ofthe local money has come in
the form ofprivate donations, she said.

Austin Jones, a Vice president of
Grinnell State, said that his family,
which runs the local bank, decided to
contribute the money to enhance bi-
cycle and pedestrian safety.

“Biking is a love ofmine," he said,
“My daughter was in a bike accident,
and I’ve been nervous about biking as
a result." '

Austin Jones‘s parents, Addison and
Marion Jones, senior bank ofﬁcers,
alsohave been concerned about safety
ever since the Rev. Bob Molsberry
was critically injured in a hit-andrnin
accident when he was bicycling ea-r of
Grinnell in 1997, Jones said.

“It’s something near and dear to our
hearts,” he said. “We respect the fact
that safety is pre-eminent."

Economic beneﬁts
But there are also economic con—
siderations for the community,"

Jones addcd.

"Tlieie is the potential bustness that
can bc gcucratod for the local
economy,"hesaid,“Thth-innellBike
Club has gone to a number oftrails,
even a rrvcrtrail in Minneapolis, They
takc20or30cvcryycurwhoarc spend»
ing $100 each. That’s a signiﬁcant
amount of revenue for the colnmu»
nity " .

A committee set up by the city is
now in the process of selecting an
engineering consultant to design spec
cifics for the project, Collum-
Calderwood said.

“We want to thank the businesses,
familiesandindividualswhohavccon-
tiibutctl," she said.

ZS—mile route

GART is a proposed trail thatwould
be 28 miles in length and would be a
fulllooprunning‘frolnGn'nnellto Rock
Creek, then returning to the city,

It would nin west on Eleventh Ave.
to county road T—38 in Jasper County,
extending all the way to the state park.
It would then loop around Rock Creek
and run soutlienstward toward Oak-
land Acres and by the Krumm Pre-
serve. The trail then would extend to
Iowa Highway 146 South near lnter~
state 80 and return to Grinnell.

The route is subjectio change, Col-
lum-Calderwood said

However, theprojcct won‘tbecom-

One ofthe enduring symbols ofthe
holiday season is beginningto make its
appearance, the wreath, a universal
shape to many cultures.

A never-ending circle. symbol of
eternity and hospitality, the Wreath is
used year-”round in various ways
(crowns, to decorate graves, table deco—
rations), but especially at the holiday
season.

One of the most attractive wreaths
on display this year is the 20rfoct-or-
more wreath on an outside wall on the
north side Grinnell Regional Medical
Center easily visible from Fourth Ave
enue and appropriately spotlighted at

~ night.

The medical center's auxiliary also
emphasized wreaths at its Holiday
Bazaar and Bake Sale last month but
not ofthe outdoor variety.

Many homes are beginning to dis-
play the cheery wreaths sold by Grins
nell Boy Scouts which were delivered
a day or two after Thanksgiving and
are now showing up all over town.

Gracing expanded areas of down-
townGrinnell thisyeararc the brightly
lighted wreaths installed by the Grin-
nell Area Chamber of Commerce.
Commercial Street is one ofthc newest
additions to receive the wreaths.

High above the heads of most ofus
but possibly the most symbolic wreath
is the Advent wreath over the entrance
to St. Mary's Catholic Church symbol-
izing the four weeks of the liturgical
Advent Season ofspiritual preparation
for Christmas, one candle lighted each
week beginning two Sundays ago on
Nov. 29 andconcluding with the fourth
Sunday of Advent, Dec. 20, the ﬁnal
Sunday before Christmas wllcn the
ofﬁcial Christmas season will begin

Residential areas also are sporting a
few outstanding wreaths. Glimpscd
during a quick driVe ‘around the town’
are a magniﬁcent green wreath outside
the entrance to the Shelley and Dion
Schrack home; the large wreath on ilic
upper level of the garage entrance to
thehome ofEsther and Charles Bctlicl;
a distinctive rectangular wreath which
appears each yearat the home ofLinda
and Robert Knierim and a lighted
wreath at the home of Shannon and
Stuart Kiiitzinger.

Other distinctive wreaths making
their appearances are based on a va-
riety of materials besides cvcrgccu,
including some eye-catching oncs
decorated from grapevine, eucalyptus

and some even on foam using natural
decorations
.

As the sports seasons turn and our
eyeballs shirt from the goal posts to the
hoops, as one wag has observed, it’s
informative to let our thoughts drift
back across the years.

Memories ofthe 1998 Grinnell High
School football team’s victories still
are still warm in our heads and the
basketball season is just beginning, so
it‘s illuminating to recall another
rccordbrcaking high school team: Res
member the other time a GHS team
ﬁnished second in state?

Chances are people like Kenny
Bumham, Matt Carey, Andy Davis,
Doug Kintzinger. Curt Lang, Steve
Matthews, Scott Sharp and Randy
Youngblood certainly do!

electrified local sports fans by igniting
an impressive march toward the state

The team lit up the cold months of

Grinnell Area
Recreation Trail

This map shows the various segments of the Grinnell Area Recreation
Trail to be developed as additional funding becomes available.

 

the second segment of the trail (see
map). Jasper County will pave a por-
tion of the east-west route a the ex-
tcnSion from Eleventh Ave. iduring
the 1999 construction season. Funds
already have been earmarked for that
paving project by the Jasper County
Board of Supervisors.

“The beneﬁts of a bike trail are
endless,” Collum-Calderwood said.
“The trail offers a safe venue for all
nonsmotorized trail users. Several re-
cent bicycle-automcbile accidents in
the Grinnell area indicate that this
trail is a muchrneeded alternative for
recreational cyclists. Secondly, GART
will create a desirable destination for
tourism and recreation. Third, GART

for the recruitment ofnew employers
and employees to the Grinnell area.
Finally, it has been demonstrated that
a paved recreation trail provides sig-
niﬁcant economic development."

Still seeking funds

The GART committee is still trying
to raise local funds as it applies for
more state money to help pay for the
next phase ofthe project, she added.

Those interested in contributing are
being asked to contact Grinnell 2000
at 236-63] 1. ' , l ‘t'

“This would be a great time to con-
tribute, since it is the end ofthe year
and all contributions are tax-deduct-
ible," Colluianalderwood said.

Sadler said in a letterto customers
that Jimmy Valentine‘s, which will

on pizza. Sadler has discontinued
other menu items.

“By focusing on pizza, our new

Jimmy Valentine‘s will concentrate

Sadler added that he is also work-
ing on a new project and hopes to

future.

Working with the college
to improve the community

Russell Osgood, Grinnell College’s new president, has released a draft plan
for spending approximately $5.3 million in discretionary money approved by
the college's board oftrustees in the form of what has been dubbed the Fund
for Excellence. For several months now, there has been discussion of the
possibility that a portion ofthat fund might be used for purposes that go
beyond the conﬁnes ofthe college campus. And Osgood‘s draﬁ proposal
conﬁrms that.

Some community leaders may have hoped for more than is contained in the
draft (Osgood will issue a ﬁnal plan on Dec. 15). But that's not very reason-
able, despite the college’s commitment to helping improve the quality oflife
oflhe city in which students, faculty and staff spend so much time. The
special fund, by its very nature, has to focus on the college community. If
there are some expenditures that beneﬁt the city as a whole, that’s wonderful.

But no one should get the idea that
the Fund for Excellence has been set
up for any purpose other than, in
Osgood's words, “to enhance
strategically the current mission of
the college by funding special
projects and opportunities . . .to
encourage the college community to
think hard about what we are
currently doing or what we lnight do
instead or additionally.“

That said, however, Osgood‘s draft plan does contain some encouraging
ideas that directly relate to the city. One affects the public schools. The
college has been funding something called the Community of Teachers,
which allows two faculty members at Grinnell High School to take what
amounts to a sabbatical and spend that time at the college, woi-kingtc
enhance their skills and pursue new ideas in their ﬁelds. It is a wonderful
concept that greatly cnhanccs a qualifying teacher‘s approach to his or her
professional duties. Happily, Osgood plans to continue funding that program,
or something akin to it.

As we reported in our Dec. 3 edition, Osgood is also pledging colicgc
participation in developing a master plan for Grinnell’s central business
district. He cnrphasizcs, however, that college participation will require “an
indication ol‘comlnitlncnt by local ofﬁcials and key membels ofthc local
busmcss community." That’s intentionally vague; no one can say at this point
precrsely how much the study will cost or precisely what its focus will be.
But it does send the clear signal tllat any such master plan will evolve only
with shared financial responsibilities.

The preliminary plan also calls for the college to share costs with Grinncll
Regional Medical Ccntcr to establish what Osgood calls “a distance learning
facility downtown that would offer courses for those ofour staff willing to
pursue a higher education option not available at the college." It's also
possible, he adds, that thc college will invest in “one or more projects in the
downtown area to help enhance thc downtown and thereby ilic attractiveness
orcoming here as a student or faculty member." Again, no specifics, But the
intent is there.

It goes without saying that the community as a whole is hugely important
lo the college’s ability to attract a diverse faculty and student body. [fthe city
is pcrccivcd by those persons as a dreary place, they're not going to want to
commit to four years 7 or, in the case of some faculty members, many more
years, So appearances, ilic availability ofscrviccs and various amcnlllos are
vcry important

Community leaders are well aware ofthis, and that's why they are eager to
work with Osgood and other college ofﬁcials to strengthen the symbiotic
relationship between the city and thc acadcrny Osgood’s preliminary plans
are very encouraging, and local leaders must do all they can to rrunurc this
growing relationship
