Tragedies Pressure Colleges
to Crack Down on Drinking

wronglyblamed alcohol for inciting

By ERIN HOLMES AND SUSAN T. PORT
Michigan Daily (U, ofMiehigan)

(U-WIRE) In response to recent
tragedies on campuses nationwide,
colleges and universities have beefed
up alcohol awareness programs, sus-
pended fraternities and formed task
forces to examine student drinking,

In some cases, they acted before de.
termining that alcohol was responsible
for the incident, making alcohol a
popular scapegoat tor collegiate traga
cdics. ,

The crackdown on alcohol nation.
wide comes at a time when the Uni.
versiry is implementing its Binge
DrinkingCommittecforalcoholedus
cation and investigating the death of
first-year student Courtney Cantor,
who fell from her sixth-{loot Mary
Marklcy Residence Hall window
nearly two weeks ago.

Cantor was found to have a blood
alcohol level of0.059. University ad.
ministrators said they are hesitant to
attribute her death to alcohol, but they
are using the opportunity to empha—
size alcohol awareness.

"What tragedies do is allow what
work has been done to try to reduce
the problems associated with alcohol
to come to the forefront," Alcohol and
other Drug Education coordinator
Marsha Benz said,

but some students said they reel
the University is wrongly pointing the
finger at the presence or alcohol on
campus.

"They're trying to crack down a lot
on alcohol" following Cantor's death,
Engineering first.year student Nate

Greenberg said. "But the main thirig‘
is people have to rake responsibility for
their actions",

Grccnbcrg, who lives on the sixth
floor of Markley, said people are in
cnrrecrly blaming the residence hall
windows or people who served Can»
totalcoholwhcnitwasCantur'sdcci—
sion to drink.

creenberg said it's not wrong to
use the opportunity to create alcohol
awareness, but people cannot solely
blamealcohol for the incident. "There
are just too many excuses," he said.
"They're not looking at the real issue."

In actions similar to the
university's, Michigan state Univet»
sityalso is targeting alcohol education
following a not on Munn held last
all, which developed rrom a peaceful
protest,

MSU spokesperson KristenTctens
said students were upset because the
universirybanntd alcohol during raill
gating parties on Munn rield before
consulting with students.

The peacerul protest turned into a
violent riot that gained national atrcn.
tion, Terens said, prompting Msu to
develop thcAlcohol ActionTeamThc
team proposed 33 rucolnmcndatlons
to the university last Friday to foster
communication between students and
the administration and to prevent
binge drinking Tctens said some stu—
dents at the not "had been drinking."

but MSU sophomore Lindsey
Rahl, who took part in the protest and
had not been drinking, said MSU

the riot. yet since i got here. there

has been a huge crackdown of alco-

hol," Rahl said. "Any way they can
blame alcohol they will."

Ar universities where alcohol is re-
lated more deﬁnitively to the tragedy,
administrators launched massive anti»
alcohol initiativcs.

Last spring a group orWashing-
ton start- University students, who had
been drinking heavily in celebration
otrhe last week ofclasses, reacted vios
lently when police ofﬁcers attempted
to break up their party. The night
ended with student arrests, property
damage and 10 injured police othe-
ers.

"The disturbance crystallized the
problem ofdrinking and the impacts
it has on relationships widi alumni,
students and the community," said
John Thielbahr, director of confer»
en'ccs and institutes at wsu.

Following the occurrence, the
school was awarded a $250,000 grant
for student alcohol awareness pro-
grams.

"we decided that we needed to
expose this on a national basis,"
Thielbahr said, adding that he curs
tendy is working on gathering experts
for a national teleconference Nov. 13
that will address collegiate drinking

Thielbaht said colleges from
around the country were invited. Al»
though western Michigan university,
Michigan Technological University
and MSU are taking part in the con-
ference, wsu has not yet received a
response from the university, '

tinuous trouble with the Soviet au-

(among other things), and convicted
to five years in a maximum security

denied him film work forscveral years.
Despite all the harassment, Paradjanov
never lost his spirits. As an often re.

Patadjanov‘s approach is
groundbreaking, away from narra-
tive, no plot structure, no dialogue,
no ctplanations are provided, only
excerpts orsayat Nova's lyrics, ace
companied by music played on tra-
ditional instruments. To me, this is
pure cinema in die artist'swotds:
"...rhe absolutely best filmmaking
would be for the deaf and dumb.

Every single shot in this film is

"There have been ongoing pro-
grams, including initiatives from its»
rerniries to go alcohol-free," Thielbahr
said. “We want students to see that
alcohol is as dangerous as anything else
they're facing."

But some students questioned the
effectiveness orany administrative et—

"Awareness hasn't changed," said
aWSU sophomore who did not want
to be named. "People still drink just
as much."

She added that members ofGrcck

Row, which is supposed to be "dry,"
go out to drink regularly . despite the
"overboard" efforts orrhc local police
department and university administra—
tors to decrease drinking on campus.

Penn state university, atwhich ti»
ors occured this past summer during
the annual arts festival, also is strug-
gling to bring alcohol awareness to stu—
dents.

The Daily Collegian, the
university's student newspaper, re.
ported that some students were drink.
ing and got out ofhand.

Bryan shine, a representative in

rsu's student government, said the
university spends too much time
blaming alcohol for uncontrolled in-
cidents, and that the universit should
address other issues besides alcohol.

"I think they are going a little too
fat," said Shine.

Whether they did or not. alcohol
continues to raise difﬁcult issues on
college campuses.
