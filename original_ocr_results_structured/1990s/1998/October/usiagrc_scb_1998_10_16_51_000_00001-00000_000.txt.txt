Student commits su'

{yanide death

News/Oplnlon editor

A Grinnell College students fatal
ingestion of potassium cyanide early
Monday madc nine otherpeople ill and
forced the temporary closure ofa col-
lege dormitory and the emergency room
at Grinnell Regional Medical Center.

Carl T. Grimm, 20, a second-year
student from Placentia, Calif, told his
roommateshortly bcfore7a.m.that he
had taken the poison and asked the
roommate to seek help.

Paramedics from Midwest Ambue
lance Service went to the second ﬂoor
of Younker Hall, but Grimm already
was in full cardiac and pulmonary ar-
rest when they arrived.

The paramedics administered oxy-
gen through a bag and mask, but were
unable to revive the strident, aNational
Merit scholar described by his father
as having suffered from a serious case
of attention deﬁcit disorder.

Risk of contamination

At a news conference conducted at
Grinnell Regional, emergency room
physician David Cranston said that the
cyanichrimmswallowed wasincrys-
talline form and posed the risk ofcon-
tamination cfpcopiewhocamein con-

tact with the student.

As a result, four paramedics, two
Grinnell College staff members and
three students were treated at the Gun-
nell hospital and later released. The
roommate, whose name was not re—
leased, was one of those treated.

Mike Sebeniechcr, who directs Grin-
nell operations for Midwest Ambu-
lance, said two ofhis paramedics also
were among those requiring treatment
for coughing and nausea, There were
no lasting effects, however.

“They didn’t know what to expect
until they got there," Sebeniechertold
The Herald-Register. “They asked the
roommate what he had taken, and he
said it was potassium cyanide."

The paramedics then donned masks
and began treating Grimm.

Containment work

the scene to do preliminary contain

Bams said he was informed by a
physician at the hospital that, because
cyanide was involved, the Fire De-
partment probably should evacuate
Younker Hall.

Since the topic of early roads was
introducedinAround'slastnotes,Betty
Ernst of thc Grinnell Historical Mu-
scnm has brought Around up to date,
ormoreaccuratelyhastakenusbackto
a source, about a local road.

Tlictopic wasengendered,ofcoursc,
by the Motorloway cavalcade of an
tique automobiles through Grinnell
Friday noon and even earlier by the
discovery ofa collection ofearly road
signs at the former Iowa Highway
Commission garage on Highway 146
South, now the ofﬁces of Criswell
Enterprises.

Daryl Morrison who has restored
three ofthc signs took the occasion to
confer with the librarian of the Iowa
Dcpaltmcnt ofTransportation in Ames
about one of the signs for Route 32,
which turned out to be an early desigr
tuition for the one of the five Iowa
priinaryhighways which did gothrough
Grinnell. Thcrroad was gradedin 1921
and graveled in 1924-25 and in 1928 it
was pavcd

An article from the Sept. 28, 1928,
issue oftlie Grinnell Herald describes
a celebration of that event which in—
eluded a caravan ofcars over the new
paving from Newton to Grinnell,
speeches in Central Park, a caravan
hack to Newton and a banquet in the
dining room ofthc Hotel Maytag.

“To some of us it seemed mighty
good to have the trek follow a paved
lriiil instead oflhe customary clay bills
withwhichmoslofusliavebcen familr
int," says the writer.

First speaker of the cvcning at the
banquctutthcHotclMaytagwas w.G.
Ray, editor of the Grinnell Herald,
who spokeofthc good feeling which
always existed between Newton and
(il‘lllllcll and the pleasure all felt at
being connected “by a road that will
still better bind us together.“

(Later mention in the program con-
cerned the annual football game on
Thanksgiving Day between the two
towns but the speakers were careful
not to dwell on the suchct.)

Pi'intcd cards with the motto “No
more mud between Newton and Grin~
hell" were distributed at the conclu—
sion ol'thc evening.

A listing of Grinnelllans who at-

tended inciuded a goodly number of
community leaders including Frank
Bartling, Dr. A. J. Brock, A. M. Bur-
ton. A.L Frisbic, cs. George, Floyd
Hatcher, Dr. W.R. Kinzer, Dr. LG.
Lemley, Paul Meyers, C.I(. Needham,
L. V. Phelps and Homer Richardson.

Automobile caravans being some-
what on people's minds, it is interest.
ing to note that the Spaulding automo-
bileproducedin Gnnnellwasinvolved
in a few in its day.

Two Spaulding cars, one driven by
Floyd Eichhom and one driven by
Charles Cratty, were entered in the
June, 1911, four-day 650-mile 70»town
Little Glidden Tour of Iowa, one re~
ceivingaperfectscoreforperfonnance
and one being docked one point for
losing a radiator cap.

The check-in point in Grinnell onthe
tour just happened to be the Spaulding
factory on Fourth Avenue and Spring
Street where “cold drinks, sandwiches
and cigars were handed out to the dust-
begrimcd contestants,” this being long
before roads were graded, graveled or
paved.

(The overall winner ofthe tourwas
a Cadillac)

A Spaulding car later was the of-
ﬁcial automobile of a transcontinental
trip from San Diego, Calif., to Wash-
ington, D.C.,toutingthe Pan American
Exposition. anashingtonthecaravan
was welcomed by President Wilson
andSecretaryofStateWilliarnJennings
Bryan.

Notsurprisingly,tlie Spauldingfam-
ily were earlyadvocates forgood roads.

But even before the first roads in the
Grinnell area were graded, the
Spaulding factory in l9lo ceased pro-
ducing automobiles.

Columbus Day came and went on
Monday, Oct. l2, a significant day
which has too little attention in this
country.

Not surprisingly, according to
Around’s correspondent in Spain, that
400-ycar-old event also is celebrated
as a holiday there on Oct. 12 although
it is referred to as the Day ofthc Spanr

thing we did was pull the ﬁre alarm,“
Barns said. “We took a megaphone
and walked all the way around the
building, talking toward the windows,
and said everyone should evacuate —
that this was no drill. Once we cleared
the building, I sent in three teams of
ﬁreﬁghters, two in each team, to cover
all three floors. Meanwhile, I had an-
other team go in with a big ventilation
fan and ventilated from the hallway
right outside the room and out the
window. We did that for abouttwo and
a‘half hours, at which time we sealed
the room, locked it and turned the
building back over to the [college]
building and grounds people, with inn
stmctions to leave the room locked.”

Produces a deadly gas

Grimm had swallowed the potas-
Slum cyanide, but the chemical can
producehydrogencyanidegasinsmall
quantities when it is mixed With water
— and much larger quantities of the
gas ifit comes in contact with acid. In
this case, the victim had vomited, and
stomach acid produced the gas that
affected the people who were at the
scene.

According to a document issued by
St. Luke's Poison Center at St. Luke's
RegionalMedicalCenterin Sioux City,
“cyanide is an extremely toxic hazard.
A single exposure to as little as 50 to
loo milligrams may cause immediate
respiratory collapse.”

Although there are antidotes to the
poison 7 a special kit ofmedications,
along with the administration of 100
percent oxygen — they must be ad-
ministered immediately to prevent
death.

It was not clear how much of the
chemical Grimm ingested, nor has it

been determined where he obtained
the potassium cyanide. College offi—
cials said supplies oftho chemical in
the biology and chemistrydepartments
were not the source. One Des Moines
television station said authorities were
speculating that Grimm had brought
the chemical with him to Grinnell,
although that could not be conﬁrmed.

‘An old bottle’?

The student's fathertoldaCalifomia
newspaper that a Grinnell physician
said the chemical was contained in “an
old bottle.”

Clanston, the emergency room doc-
tor, said at the news conference that
fire, police and medical personnel be-
gan to deal with the implications of
exposure to the poison once they real-
ized that the student was. dead.

A pilot projectencourages
more civil campaigns

Next Monday, Oct, 19, the League of Women Voters and the Alliance for
Better Campaigns plan to announce at a press conference that they are
including Iowa among 10 “pilot states" in an effort to improve elections. It‘s
a wonderful idea, but it will take the cooperation of candidates as well.

The Alliance for Better Campaigns should command some attention. It is
up and running because ofa $3.7 million grant from the Few Charitable
Trusts, and it is being chaired by news luminary Walter Cronkite and former
Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford. According to a spokeswoman for

the alliance, the idea is to target
Iowa and nine other states “as ‘
laboratories to find ways to make
politics and elections more interest-
ing to voters."

Accordingly, it is focusing on
ways to improve candidate account-
ability, media coverage and citizen
involvement. At the conclusion of
the Monday news conference, there
will be an hour-long discussion
among community leaders regarding

how residents oflowa can become more involved politically v and, in the
words ofthc alliance spokeswoman, “what can be done to getaway from
mu‘drslinging campaigns and return the dialogue to meaningful debates
which bring voters the facts they need to make informed choices."

To most Iowans, the reference to mudrslinging is the most signiﬁcant.
Wllh the election only 2 [/2 weeks away, the airwaves are becoming polluted
once again, as they do every two years. It's interesting that the League of
Women Voters and the Alliance for Better Campaigns are seeking to work
directly wnh the candidates for governor to improve the tenor ofthe came
paign. Republican Jll’n Ross Lightfoot and Democrat Tom Vilsack have been
less than cordial toward one another. They can’t be faulted for that, because
they represent widely divergent political philosophies. But they can be held
accountable for misleading advertising, and some in the media are trying to
do just that by poring carefully over voting records and pointing out any
distortions that creep into print and electronic political advertismg.

Again, though, the success ofany effort to improve the electoral process
won‘t work unless all the candidates for all public oleccs take a pledge.
Some might suggest that it’s pretty naive to think that will ever happen. But
at least some very responsible pcoplc arc trying to improve the current
system. And the more an election is held up to careful, bipnnisan scrutiny,
the better the chances are that candidates will be more careful with the way

they deliver their messages.
