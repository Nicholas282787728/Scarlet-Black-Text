Grinnell reoc’rs i0 descrimincliory incidenis

Siuden’rs fclce several occurences

A beginningcofcthc—ycar retreat for members
ofASIA turned sour on september 1 I when stu.
deno became thevicrirns orovett racist remarks.

Upon entering Twentieth Century Bowling
in Ames, students were harassed by members of
a bowling league. Intervention by the manage»
ment was largely ineircetive, and ASLA was left
rrusttated and upset.

“I can see this happening again," said
Hormuz Batliboi ’00, a member ofASIA who
went on the retreat.

In order to counteract the incident, hrrrher
pursuit was necessary. Multicultural and Acae
demic Advising Counselor MelissaScheid spoke
with the manager orTwentieth Century Bowl-
ing that Friday. According to scheid, he was very
apologetic, noting that such a circumstance had
never occurred before.

“He stated several times that he wouldn’t
stand for such harassment," said scheid. “He
seemed to fccl bad about the way he had handled
the incident.”

The following Monday, Schcid contacted the
owner of the bowling alley, who reacted with
similar regret.

He agreed to collaborate with the secretary
othe bowling league in writing a formal letter
to the harassets. The letter would present fac—
tual information regarding the incident, express-
ing that die bowling alley was unwilling to role
erate such hrture behavior.

A drart of the letter ms recently presented
to scheid, who approved its content butwanted
to pursue rutdiet consequences for the offende
etc. However, sinccTwentierh Century is a pu’oc

ASIA is seeking to inform multicultural stu»

also contacted the student dcan at Iowa State to
create awareness and seek advice regarding suit-
able reactions to such hate crimes.

“it’s a very unfortunate incident," said
Schcid, “but it brought us together. It helped
create our own awareness around overt racist
behaviors"

Schcid emphasizcd that the diversity ofcx-
pcriences in ASIA has created strong support
ling for students. Some members have been bla-
tantly harassed before, but for enters, the Ames
incident was a first.

“These ASIA students feel their power was
taken away," noted Scheid, “but they stood up
for themselves, and people do that in diherent
ways.”

Unfortunately, AsIAs cxpericnce in Amer is
not an isolated incident. On the CBS Retreat in
Cedar Rapids this fall, students were harassed
by hotel management.

”They complained that we were making too
much noise," said Sherman ‘Wlllis '01, a CBS
spokesperson. However, members were staying
on the fifth or sixth ﬂoor ofthc l’lOICl, and there
was a loud party on the second floor.

Even after inrorming management of the
party, CBS members were further haraced. Hoe
tel stair patrolled their floors the entire night.

“It was quite embarrassing," said Willis. “It
totally dampened the parade." cos has filed a
complaint and is now in litigation with the ho-

later that evening, some members of Iso

“I found it very insulting,” said Amit
Nangalia ‘01, who was pan orthe group.

According to Alex Hernandez ’01, a mem—
ber or SOL, racccrclatcd incidents are often
rooted in ignorance. “The confrontation and die
gtaltiti was beyond a poor reﬂection upon the
community at large," said Hernandez, “but it
also indicatm diat there is still a lot ortension

Homophobic slurs, including obscene language and drawings, were round on a
whiteboard outside orResidence Lifc Coordinator John Mounsey last Saturday.

In response, Moiinscy, the RLC for Cleveland and Main. issued a response over
email, asking students to “help put a stop to this destructive behavior."

As a result, more than one hundred students, as well as several members of the
administration, attended a meeting Wednesday night to discuss an appropriate re-
sponse to the incident.

Members orstonewall Coalition, (stoneCo), Diversity Coalition, (DivCo) and
student Government Association, (SGA) were among thc many students who at-
tended. ‘

Attendees, who voiced outrage over the incident, discussed the need for an imme-
diate and noticablc response. “I think we need to do something that's loud,” said one
student.

students decided that a visible response in time for family weekend (October 24)
would reach a wider audience.

The group decided to reach out with signs and with a campus rally.

“Hate Free Grinnell" signs were distributed throughout the dorms and to off-
campus students to address the broader issue ofintolerancc. In addition, “Queer sate
Space" signs were distributed.

“The reason that we’re handing these signs out is because its a show not just against
what happened to John, but against hate crimes in general," said Maren Pctcrson ‘99,
who helped to coordinate sign design and distribution.

A rally to tor a “Haterree Grinnell" has been scheduled for today at noon on the
Forum Beach to allow students to respond to recent incidents.

In addition, there are different levels ofha-

A core group ofapproximately eight Grin-
nell College students is focusing on commu—
nity initiatives to put an end to sweatshop la-

Dominic Crossan will visit Grinnell College to de»
liver 2 number oflectutes concerning “the historical
Jesus." crossan will participate the Gates Lecture se.
ties and the Scholars’ Convocation.

The Gates Lecture will be held on Wednesday,
October 7, at 8 pm. in Herrick Chapel. The lecture,
entitled “Method and History: How do you recon»
struct the historical Jesus?” will focus on the process
and technique used by Crossan to evaluate Jesus
Christ as an historical figure. The following day,
Crossan will deliver the Scholars’ Convocation in
Herrick Chapel at It aim. The topic will be “His
tory and Faith: Why do you reconstruct the historic
cal Jesus?"

Although the Gates Lecture and Scholars’ Corie
vocation are his two major priorities, Crossan will
also hold a number of other engagements while at
Grinnell. He will be a guest speaker in the two teli.
gious studies classes that focus on historical inter.
pretations ochsus, In addition, he will hold an in-
formal reception after the Wednesday lecture to talk
with faculty and students.

The arrival ofJohn Dominic Crossan at Grin-
nell college is a major event. Many consider him to
be one of the foremost scholars in the subject of the
historical Jesus, as wcll as one of the most Controvcr»
siali Born in Ireland, Crossan has studied Christian-
iry in Jerusalem and Rome, among other places. He
has been a member of a Roman Catholic order as
well as an ordained ministcr. H: is currently Profcs»
sot Emeritus of Religious Studies at Dci’aul Univer-
sity. Ctossan has written over a dozen books on Jesus
and Christianity, including 777: Hitteri‘ca/ 1am: The
Life ofe Mediterranean Pearce: and from A Revolu-
tionary Biography. His latest book is entitled The Bot/r

According to Thorson—
Smith, Crossan reconstructs
Jesus life and Christianity
in a literal manner. Known
for his precise, methodical
techniques, crossan uses a
variety of evidence from
Jewish and GtccOcRoman
culture, including texts, art,
and oral tradition, to form
an understanding ofthe his-
torical Jesus. The rcsulting
picture is often different
from the biblical portrayal
of Jesus.

Among Thotson»
Smith’s classes, student reac»
tion to Ctossan’s ideas is var»
icd. Said ThorsoneSmith,
“Some students who don't
identify themselves as Chris»
tian find (Crossan's work)
very scholarly." on the other
hand, shc noted that among
(host who consider them-
selves Christian, the range of
response was greater. Some
were intrigued, while others
found Ctossan’s work “un-
settling to their faith.” Al—
most universally, however,
the students found that
Crossan “made them think.
And for that, they respect
him,"

Many students have expressed interest in
Crossnn and his upcoming visit, ic Moore ‘99, a
religious studico- major who has taken Tliorson-
Smith’s class, plans ro attcnrl both the Gates Lecture
and the Scholars' Convocation. Said Moore, “
ally interested in seeing him, I hope a lot of people
come to convo. He really has interesting and radical
things to say. I don’t know ifI agree, but he defi-
ltitcly put a lot onork (into his research)."

John Dominic Crossan is the most recent in a
long line of famous Gates Lecturers. Esiablished in
1913 in honor orretmct Grinnell President George
A. Gates, the annual lecture series seeks “to bring to
the campus the very best or modern thought” on
religion.

 

bot. Cori zagatell ’00 and John Howard ’00
are championing this effort, working to estab-
lish a coalition ofstudent groups allied against
sweatshops.

They are pushing to write a code of con-
duct that will prevent the College Bookstore
from stocking sweatshop produced textiles.
Secrecy within the textile industry currently
makes it impossible to determine the condi—
tions under which the clorhes stocked by the
bookstore are produced, according to Howard.

A letter has been sent to President Russell
Osgood asking for his support. In addition,
“We're going to have petitions. We’re looking
to have more active education and support,”
said Zagarell.

Eventually Zagarell and Howard hope that
a studentefaculty committee will be formed to
draft a code of conduct. ‘

Zagarcll spent last summer investigating
sweatshops in El Salvador, Honduras and Nicae
ragua with the National Labor Committeci
Howard has spent several summers interning
at UNITE, an international tcxtilc union af-
filiated with the AFL/CIO, where he learned
about labor conditions at sweatshops.

A sweatshop is a textile factory where work»
cts are paid sub-poverty levcl wages. They may
also be subjected to verbal and physical abuse,
Although zagatell's sweatshop investigations
took place in Central America, sweatshops are
not unique to a particular region ofthe globe.
“A third of the garment industry in New York

It’s worse else-

“This is not a ‘Buy American campaign,”
zagatell emphasized. such a campaign would
take yobs from workers in third world countries
without necessarily eliminating sweatshop labor.
