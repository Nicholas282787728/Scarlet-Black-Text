album reviews . Album reviews A Lee 23 as/Nate Sherer - a e 25

be on everyone’s shopping list if you‘ve heard this live album. lfanything, you can hear the songs when their guitars are in tune. Well, I doubt if that's even true, if you like the Blues
Explosion, go get this and find out what the demented rock and roll mind of Jon Spencer thoughtten years ago-MR 6Pearl Jam Yield The myth that Pearl Jam somehow sold out along
the way — not booking wtth Ticketmaster, reyecting MTV - is perhaps the greatest travesty the music industry has perpetuated in the last ten years, if not longer The chains that Eddie
Vedder found in "Corduroy" during the 1994 Vitalogy sessions (“everything has chains/absolutely nothing‘s changed‘) are alive and well in the new “Given to Fly" (“he floated back down
‘cause he wanted to share/this key to the locks on the chains he saw everywhere). is this our familiar, valiant Eddie saVIor? But‘Pearl Jam is somehow fundamentally different from the
band thatcreated Ten and Vs , despite the fact thatreminiscent currents run throughoutali their albums, With each new record, the band movies a couple degrees further down the line,
but in an awkward, seemingly incomprehensible direction away from the obvious. Each album is integrally connected to its predecessor and successor, but the sum of the parts, or the
difference between Ten and Yield, is like night to day, iack irons is no Dave Abbruzzese, not by a long shot. But this isn’t to see Irons isn't good. On the contrary, he brought a different
feel to both Merkinball and No Code, and has brough the same to Vield, as well. The songs are still varied and interesting—listen for the little noises spread throughout the album or the
movements of “No Way” and “Do the Evolution." ls Pearl Jam “in Hiding?" It has been suggested by a close friend of mine that this song is the best one Pearl Jam has yet to share.
Debatabie lor sure, but maybe not dismissable. On this album, Jeff Ament‘s bass still roams whereever it pleases, and the tones [if not the pleasing irreverence) of Stone Gossard and
Mike McCready are as wonderfully enjoyable as ever. Eddie of the golden pipes is sterling once again, if not bean-felt. He could, however, still be suffering from, or grappling with, the
burden of his"generation posterrboy" image. Last year's cold reaction to No Code (by the recordebuying audience, in any case) might at some point help. Maybe he is tired. Does anyone
remember the dedication of "Go" to Kurt Cobain (a couple days before the suicide) during the radio broadcast of the Atlanta concert? "Don't Go On Me" holds a cenain significance, So
what does this latest Pearl Jam album mean to us now? For me, this album lacks the sheer urgency and transcendent pulse of "Rearviewmirror" or “Blood," but it is still miles ahead of
any ofthe horrendous shoveled shit your ears could be subjected to by turning on the radio. That's not to saythat this album is good by default, though. ltis simply a rubber soul and not
a revolver. It's not a coincedence that despite being stripped and stabbed by faceless men, the protagonist of “Given to Fly" still stands, Like him, Eddie still gives away his love, or the.
closest things he’s got—his songs. Vedder might never be at peace—it has been said that there is no rest for the weary. “The whole world will be different soon" he belts in the album’s
opener, "Brain ofJ.” One might only hopethis sentimentwill be on a few more people's wish liststhis year.-LZ 7Mary Lou Lord Got No Shadow This record has its highs and lows, but also
thingsthat remain unresolved, There is a slight lack of variety, and it’s missing a little of that "ﬁre" that i look for in an, There are two things about this album that are worth discussing. For
one, the split personality, Who is the real Mary Lou Lordeis she a sweet»singing nice girl or a slick hip chick? Both. This is good, and maybe her biggest attraction. Examine the lyrics:
“Now LSD and ecstacy don‘t help me/and my dance with Mr. Brownstone got too rough/will you wake me without warning somejinglejangle morning/we’ll fly away to heaven on a
star." This is nice, but Lord lets go of some of her lyrics in an askance fashion, as if she was “too fucked up to care." And everything she says, including the aforementioned lines, comes
out in that sweet monotone—Whether good, bad, ugly, sunbeam, bushmills, or lameflame. This works mostly to heradvantage, butwhy all the new clothes and trendy haircut, then? The
real question here is why we can’t get a complete Mary Lou album—one in which she writes and sings and plays Her sell-titled effort on Kill Rock Stars Records has her singing and
playing guitar, but not all of the songs are hers. Here, she‘s written most of the songs [Freddy Johnston and Elizabeth Cotton covers, and a few songs written by Nick Salomanl, but she
doesn't play guitar. This is, I think, the worst part ofthe albumi “So hold my eye/while the rest ofthe city flies by/and the tips and the tokens you left me today/are the price of my ride on
the subway." My advice: get this album, Mary Lou Lord definitely deserves your spare change-L2 7Mary Lou Lord Got No Shadow [Key Words: sun dress, solace, pleasure, concrete
wildebeest, Courtney Love, taco pizza, halo.) Mary Lou Lord's got a lotgoing for herthese days. Panhandled on the streetcorners and subways of Boston and New York City, she long ago
learned to nonchalantly skip back and forth across the battered electric fence bordering the windswept acreages of indie rock, folk, pop, and country—happy to take a iuke warm bath in
the American musical melting pot, washing her sore feetin the viscous longings of a generation for some sort of neo-beattroubadour who actually gives a shit. Awoman with no genre,
a guitar. and the shadow of Bob Dylan where hers used to be probably should have a lot to wail about. But Mary Lou’s tone is never very bitter on Got No Shadow, her first full-length
release. Instead she consistently soothes the postmodern mind with her slow rumblings: herVOIce submissive, quaking with all ofthat intense meaning Got No Shadow is chock full of
urban reflection and longrdistance lovesick contemplation, enough to really make you sit down hard on the radiator and ponder human frailty. She teams up with one of her personal
teen idols, Nick Saloman, legendary member the Bevts Frond, to scribe several of the albums tunes, and cops a couple of historic gems from Freedy Johnston and Elizabeth Cotton, as
Well. Her workings are sporadically supported by a plethora of somber rocks favorites including Shawn Colvin, Elliot Smith, Nels Cline, Money Mark, and Roger McGuinn. The renovated
version of "Jingle Jangle Morning" and new track ”His Lamest Flame" stand out as prime mix tape material for all peoples, regardless hairstyle or button collection, "Two Boats" and
“Western Union Desperate" lamentrideal material for the metaphysical soundtrack to accompany the contemporary western ZO-something romantic melodrama. Makes me lonelnyS
EKara's Flowers The Fourth World iKey Words' charming, heartfelt, hooks, upbeat, optimistic, selfrcentered, peristalsis) If you like Weezer, you'll love Kara‘s Flowers. With less than 2
years until the end of the world, i don't understand why the hell anybody would be attempting to be positive about anything not related to death and destruction, But following capitalist
logic, such a time of bitterness and last minute haterage might actually have created some sort ofmusical nichefor the happy, oblivious power pop spewings thatcan be found on Kara‘s
Flowers first release, The Fourth World. With an ironically repugnant band name, album title, dress code, and persona (all goodrnatured, all the time: Adam Levine whines, "I can‘t find
anything to be sad about" on the band's apparent manlfesto, "Mysell'i, Kara‘s Flowers come across pretty much like you would imagine such a group wouideWith positively dorky pop
tunes on the whole (‘To Her, With Love 'My Ocean Blue") albeit some rare hints of charismatic charm and shrewdity (the line “Teddy Ruxpin is a Whore" on “Future Kid," their MTV bid ”Soap
Disco"), The overall indication is that the band has potential. But for what? l‘m really too frustrated and disillusioned with my situation to give a damn. But keep in mind, the band
members are all under 20 and it’s probably not their fault that the album is over-produced or that Christians dig their giddy lyrics-NS
