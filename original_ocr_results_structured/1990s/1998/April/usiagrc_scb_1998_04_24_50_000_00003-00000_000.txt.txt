BY SARAH REINHARD

A year of intense choreography
and rehearsals culminated in thc
Grinnell College Dance Troupe’s
spring performance this past week-
end,

Comprised of two parts, the con-
cert exhibited both studentechoreo-
graphed pieces and Vaslav N ijinsky's
“L'Apreeridi d‘un Faune."

With six seniors and a stable un—
derclassman base, the group dellVr
ered a strong and promising perfor-
mance,

“Troupe is especially solid and
cohesive this year,” said Jami
McDowell ’98.

Requiring the time
commitment and
physical prowess of
any athletic team,
Dance Troupe is a
year-long responsibil-
ity.

Members practice
four days a week but
also hold numerous re-
hearsals. This
weekend’s performance consisted
primarily of pieces Troupe has been
working on since the fall, with the
exception ofa couple numbers.

“Most of the work was acontinu»
ation of the November show,“ said
Rachel Knudson ‘00, who just joined
Troupe this fall, “but it was a full pro
duction."

“L’Apres-Midi d’un Faune" was
a major project for Troupe thi. year.
During the fall, members learned to
read elementary labanotation. then
studied their pans over Christmas
Break.

The Grinnell College Orchestra
played a necessary role, accompany-
ing the production of Faune. Orchesr
tra members attended many rehearse
als in preparation for the perfor-

Most comptinies who pctlorttt the
piece, such as the Otikllllid Ballcl lll
California and New Yolli’s lullinrd
School. have been studying
lnbanotntion for years

“I think the Faune projccl is very
good for promoting dance," stiid
Rachel Knudsen ‘00.

Troupe received exit-n hclp from
Ann Hutchilisoanucst, who wtotc
the score of Falulc and visited front
London for a full week to \v0ik with
Grinnell danccls.

Hutchinson-Guest has done cxr
tensivc studies regarding
labanotatton, and was the first to read
and translate NaJiiisky’s notes

“We had a great time working and

“For me, Troupe has been a very
rewarding experience This is .
my third year in the Troupe and
I’m going to miss thecomeraderie
next year.” - Jami McDowell ‘98

talking with her," stated Deborah
HolbrookrSpilmait ‘98.

Of equal importance to the con—
cert were thc numerous student-cho-
reographed pieces bciiig perfomicd.

Student choreography, done by
Elizabeth Chilcozit '00, Alison Hart
'98, Lisa Hetzel ’00, Deborah
Holbrook—Spilmaii '98. Knudsen,
Christina Peters '00, and Claire
Rambo ’98, is a yearlong effort.

Such close collaboration makes
Dance Troupe a very special group
to‘be part of.

“We have a really good karma,"
said HolbrookrSpillnan. “We can get
our non—academic needs met."

McDowell agreed, noting the
pleasures that come from shtircd nr-
tislie expression. “For me, Troupe
has been a ver rewardin '

If you‘ve ever hung out With the boys from James third, you probably
have a good idea of how much fun they are. Pat Munley ’01 and Ike
Willig ‘Ol's radio show 33 is reflective of the fun and good times

AE: So, let’s start off with the ba»
sibs. What is the name of your radio
show 7

PM: It’s called I3.

AE: And what does that stand for?

PM: Basically, it stands for our
ﬂoor. We live on Iames third. It was
late at night and we had to turn in
our application the next day.
There is some signiﬁcance
to the name, I guess, because
we ﬁgured that not a vast
number of people on this
campus listen to rap and our
floor is kind of like a rap
haven of sorts.

AE: So, let me guess, you
guys have a rap show. What
artists can one expect to hear
on your show 7

IW: A Tribe Called
Quest, 2Pac,Lil' Kim ..

AE: And, when is your
show?

PM: Thursdays, between
10.12 pm.

AE: Are you happy with
that time slot?

IW: Yeah. We wanled it
after 10 so that we could
play explicit lyrics. After 10
you can play cuss words on
the radio.

AE: How big a following
do you think you have on the
Grinnell campus?

PM: Well, I’m not really sure

1w: But the people on our floor
listen...

PM: Actually, most of the time
they’re usually over at KDIC when
we do our show, We know that at
least a few people listen because the
last time we made up this weird cone
test ifyou were the 88th caller, you
won something. Granted it was only
like three or four people calling, but
they called a million times over...

IW: So, at least we know that
some people listen,

AE: You mean apart from the
people on James third?

PM: Yeah,

IW: Yeah.

AE: Do you cvcr put people on
your show?

PM: Actually, we have b segment
on our show with one of the guys
from our floor named Jason Hoppc,
He’s all into deep meanings and he’s
even quoted the Bible on our show.

AE: And how does that fit in with

the entire rap genre thtit your show
is all about?

IW: Well. it adds an interesting
twist to it lint! kinda gives it niiothct
dimension.

PM: Yeah, so he brings a song Ill
and he'll break it down and tell us
all about the iucaiiillg, Then we'll
throw a rap song back al him and
break that one down.

He's pluycd sturt likc Dave
Matthews and chc1 for us. He hasn't
played any Beach Boys yet, even

though that's his favorite kind of

music.

Harpists, singers add
to musical mayhem

Two weekend performances offer

CIICCAgClllng to collabointc with
other pcoplc who love to dance nnd

bodies," slie sliitl. “This is my third
year in Troupc and I'm definitely
going to miss the Colrtcmdcric next
year."

The group consists of eleven
members, wttli Holbrook~Spilnian
and McDowell actinglis co-captains,

Two guest pcrfomlcrs, Sarah King
'98 aiid .lC Cochran ’98, danced with
Troupe in this weekend’s concert.

Of instructor Tcrcsa Holland and
her substitute Krissie Marty,
HolbrookrSpllmﬂn noted that both
were “great role models, not just as
dancers but as human beings,"

This positive
coaching is particu-
larly valuable for
Troupe, considpring
that Grinnell
Collegc's Fine Arts
program does not in-
clude a Dance De»
purtmcnt, making
formal instruction
hard to come by,

Despite this lack
of some valuable resources, Troupe
has thrived on hard work, talent, and
drive.

”Even though we don’t always
have support," said Holbrookv
Spilmail, “we make it work."

HolbrookrSpilmali also enlhusias-
tically noted the large impact that
SGA’S valuablc ﬁnanctal and moral
contributions have made on Troupe‘s
success.

“SGA has been incredibly sup-
portive," she said. “and very encour-
aging.“

The "xtensivc preparation and as.
sistallcc resulted in three concerts

he didn't play it because tasked him
about it last week and he was com-
plaining how the Beach Boys don’t
have meaningful lyrics.

AE: And you think that rap has
meaningful lyrics?

1w: Well, not always,

AE: Do you think that rap is away
for the youth to express what they
are feeling in a non—Violent way, or
is itjust rapt

I’M: To me, it'sjiist rap. I mean,
there are some songs that have incattr
lugs and stuff but a lot of it IS Just
bullsiit.

AE: Well, most songs are full of
bulls**t. Basically, do you think that
rap is just a beat and a bunch of
words strung together?

IW: I disagree with that.

PM: Me too.lmcan, I’ve
listened to rap forever and
I’ve never really tried to ﬁnd
a meaning to it or anything.
But when you listen to some
thing for so long you start to
hcar some things iii it dint arc
less obvious to people who
don’t listen to this type of
music,

IW: I think that ti lot of
the negative rap songs get
the publicity and that's what
all the people know about.

AE: Do a lot or people
call into your show?

PM Wcll,llic ﬁrst couple
of weeks we had more call-
crs than we do now...

AE: Is that a sign?

PM: Who knows?

IW. We normally have Ell
least one or two.

PM: Usually our
floormtitcs come over and
hang out til the show with us., ’t's a
good time; we have our own little
party.

AE: Do you ever put them on air?

IW: Oh yeah. They normully ol»
ways have something interesting to
say,

PM: Like Dnvc Julis cspecially.
He's totally random. He'll say the
stupidest things ever.

lW: Yeah. Hc‘ll say the most in-
appropriate things, loo,

PM: He has his own ngciidii that
he's tlctiling with til the time he's
kinda like oili laugh lrack, as well
So peoplc might not listen to us, but
we have it good time,

harps, voices

BY RYAN OLSON
Staff Writer

with two concerts taking place
tonight, as well as one this Sunday,
many Grinnell students are once
again going to share their love of
music with the rest of the college
campus.

Starting tonight at 7 in the South
Lounge of the Forum, Gi‘innell Col-
lege harpists, including seven stu-
dents and a staff member, will
pefomi a concert‘s worth of Celtic
songs.

At 8:30 a concert entitled “Four
Quartets" will be presented in
Herrick Chapel by the Grinnell Col-
lege Chalnber Ensemble, and on
Sunday, a presentation of“All Night
Vigil" by Sergei Rachmaninov will
be performed by the Grinnell Com-
munity Chorus, with the help ofthe
Grinnell Singers, at 3 pm.

The Celtic concert taking place
this evening will be an informal per-
formance of several songs on the
small harp, known as a clarsach in
Scotland. Additionally, there will be
a performance of classical works on
concert harps. Solo performances of
familiar lrish melodies entitled
“Brian Boru‘s March" and “Clay of
Kilcreagan" will be given, and sev-
eral ensemble works are also sched-
uled for the show.

Courtney Birkett ‘99, Meaghan
Evans ‘01, Brooks Locke ‘99. Katie
Marienfeld ‘00, Hillary Mertaugh
‘0], Elizabeth Twicg ‘00, and Jen
Whartenhy ‘99 are the Ctrinnell stu-
dents who will perform, in addition
to Helyn Wohlwend, Steiner Hall
secretary.

“I play the pedal harp, a.k.:i. the
concert harp," stated Marienfeld,
who is currently taking her second
semester of lessons, She “absolutely

you think students are to this kind of
music, which is deﬁnitely popular
and alot more mainstream in the big-
ger cities?

PM: Well, some people are more
open to it than others but they've
kind of had some background with
it. There are a lot of people who are
way closed-minded towards it and
just won’t have any of that “noise,”
so I’d say that by and large, there are
a lot of people who aren't very re-
ceptive towards it,

AE: Do y Jll think that the Grinnell
college community, being so PC on
the whole, would ﬁnd any ofthelyr-
ics in the rap songs that you play of-
fcnsive?

PM: Deﬁnitely.

IW: Most definitely, Especially to
women.

AE: Give me an example.

IW: Well, there‘s that Lil’ Kim
song, ‘Big MamaThing' —“I used to
be scared of the dick, and then I put
lips to the s*"‘t."

PM: ...£irid handled it like a real
bitch. Take it in the butt...

AE: OK, enough, stop!

PM: Yeah well, aspecific example
of this would be when one of Ike’s
acquaintances came up to the show
and hadjust listened to one song that
is particularly offensive to, I would
assume, a lot of women.

AE: What song would this be?

1w: ‘World‘s Biggest Dick’ by 2
Live Crew.

PM: It's basically supposed to
be,..well, an instruction to oral sex,
basically.

AE: Couldn‘t that be considered
educational?

PM: Well, ifyou wanted to take it
that way, I guess. But I know she
didn’t take it that way, that’s for sure.
She wasn’t too happy about that song
and me being the rap advocate thatl
am I had to be a hard ass and not
give in and just admit that it‘s a slu—
pid song, So that became kind of a
heated little discussion. A lot of rap
really has no meaning and is just
there for shock value and to offend
people, make “em mad, I guess.
You‘ve gotta learn not to let it affect
you that way and just laugh.

AE: If you were to descn'be your
show in a couple ofsentences or less,
how would you describe it?

PM: “Our show is so deep that all
the sex and dope in this world can‘t
crasc your need, You golta get into
it."

love(s) itl", as she commented. and
added that “it seems like everything,
even basic scales, sound great on a
harp." Referring to one ofthe pieces
she is scheduled to perform in the
concert, Marienfeld mentioned how
she‘s “worked hard on it, and I think
it's about ready to be performed be.
fore an audience.”

Birkett. commenting on the nature
of the instruments involved, added
that “I think harps, especially Celtic
harps, are wonderful instruments,
and I like sharing them with other
people who agree, whether they're
playing or listening."

Nancy McFarland Gaub will be
directing the performance of “Four
Quartets,” the second of two concerts
consisting of the music of Gustav
Mahler, Feliz Mendelssohn, Maurice
Ravel and Wolfgang Mozart.

Some of the music to be per-
formed is rarely heard, such as the
Mahler piece, which was composed
when he was quite young. The
Mendelssohn piece is also something
of a youthful work, composed in the
young man's late teens.

The performance of
Rachmaninov‘s work this Sunday
will serve as a culmination of not
only the weekend's three perforr
mances, but also a summation of a
great deal of work put in by all of
the choir members.

A portion of last semester's choir,
which performed Handel's Messiah,
has been lost, but, as Rommereim
cemented, “the people who have
stayed...are doing a splendid job.
When we put the Grinnell Singers
and the chorus together, the sound is
fantastic.” Rommereim attributes
this to the presence of the older men
in the Community Chorus; they are
“especially helpful in this piece be-
cause they add the strong bass that it
needs," as Rommereim says.

Describing the work as a “rich,
soulful, powerful piece." he continr
ued by saying that if you take the
trouble to study the translation and
if you do the work to try to under-
stand it, “it will affect you power-
fully."

Having studied Russian for many
years, Rommereim took a trip to St.
Petersburg several years ago, during
which he heard a performance of the
Rachmaninov Vigil, and was “over—
whelmed with the experience."

Ultimately, as he explained, “this
music asks a lot of the performers
and of the audience, but if you do
give it the attention it deserves, it will
reward you greatly."

Interestingly enough, the concert
is coordinated with an exhibition on
Russian spirituality.

“There is an exhibit of icons in the
basement of the library," as
Rommereim added, and there was a
gallery talk on the icons on this past
Thursday at 4:15. In addition, a
panel discussion on Russian Chris»
Lianity is scheduled for this afternoon
at 4:15. If you are able to attend all
of the events. Rommereim menr
tioned, “you will ﬁnd that the whole
experience is greatly enhanced."

Whether it be Celtic harp, Rus—
sian choral, or ensemble music, there
is quite a variety of performances to
be heard this weekend.
