Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid ﬁ 3:5 $ $

Before 1 review any movies, let mejust say a big welcome back to everybody. I hope your breaks were good and
did not involve Oklahoma in any way. Now, on to the movies. This one was great. Normally. westerns arejust
dumb and boring. A bunch ofrednecks shooting each other in the desert I spend the time watching them wishing
that real rednecks that I know would engage in such activities.

This movie was different, and the reason why can be summed up in 2 words: Newman and Redford. They are
always teaming up, but in this movie their duality works really well. Redford‘s funny in a quiet way, while Newman
is more publicly amusing. They commit some harmless crimes and end up getting chased all over the desert and
South America. The ;ntire time, they crack jokes and refuse to acknowledge their homosexual attraction to one
another. They have a woman with them, and she dates Redford 's characterSeerelly. though, neither of the two men
are very interested in her. Watch and see what you think.

This movie is a sort of late 605 prototype. It has some interesting fllmwork. It can be good at times, such as in
scenes where the characters seem to be talking about important things but are drOWned out by parlor music. But
there are some bad scenes, too, such as a number of horrible musical interludes. But you do get to see Cloris
Leachman when she was hot. (She played Grandma in that ten‘ihleBeverly Hillbillizs movie. Iwouldn’t bring it up,
except that she went to my high school. But I’m rambling.) -

Starring John Cusak

What can I say about this one? It’s
a classic, and I‘m one ofthose people
who like John Cusak for no discern—
ible reason, save his cuteness. It‘s ok,
though: so’s my dad.

Was your favorite pan of Boogie
Night: the whole 705 decor, and not
Mark Wahlberg's penis sticking out
for all to see? If so, then the good
news about this movie is that it takes
place in the 705. The bad news is that
it also takes place in the suburbs,
which we all know to be the ultimate
source of every imaginable evil. This
fact promises that the movie will in
volve a bunch of coldshearted sub-
urbanites whining about their hot»
rible lives. But still, I hear this is a
quality movie, and who amI to judge
their wretched lives'.7 This was named
by Gene Siskel to be the number one
movie of the year.

The Daytrippers

Directed by Greg Mottola. Star-
ing Parker Poesy, Stanley Tucci, and
Hope Davis

Main 2nd someday and see the
Duym'pper: poster there, which has
been brutally bumed. I don‘t know
ifthis is a commentary on the qual-
ity of the movie or not. but even if it
is, they are a bunch of uncivilized
savages doWn there; you should
avoid them at all costs, and espe-
cially ignore their taste in movies.
This movie stars Stanley Tucci
and Parker Poesy, indie stars if ever

there were any. A bunch of young-
sters travel to Manhattan because one
thinks her marriage is in trouble. I
guess they hit some troubles along
the way or something. See it. Or
don't. I don’t really care one way or
the other.

Wow. That was really cold-
hearted. I'm sorry. Won‘t happen
again.

The New York Time: called
Deathlrap "A stylish, sneaky, cat-
andsmouse moviet..with humor,
intellegence and unmistakable
ﬂare.,.plot twists are everything."

Christopher Reeve, Dyan Kannon
and Michael Caine star in this
thriller, made before Reeve's acci-
dent. Reeve plays a former student
of Michael Caine's charater, a pro«
fessor and writer of Broadway mys-
tery hits. Reeve sends his former
professor the “perfect mystery," des-
tined, the teacher thinks, to make a
fortune. So begins the plot of Deal}:-
trap, hinged on a multitude of twists,
suprises and red herrings. Rex Reed
wrote, "Vastly entertaining, nail-
gnawing suspenser Christopher
Reeve is excellent, as are Caine and
Kannon. Sidney Lumet's direction
is outstanding."
