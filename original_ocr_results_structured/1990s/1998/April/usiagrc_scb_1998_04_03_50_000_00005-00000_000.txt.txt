An intense week of spring train-
ng in Florida provided the Grinnell
College softball team with tough
ompetition in the ﬁrst outdoor ace
ion ofthe season. Ten games in six
ays proved to be a challenge, but
ow back in Iowa the squad must
echarge itself to travel to Illinois
ollege on Saturday for their Mid—
est Conference opener.
Posting a 2-8 record, with two of
hose losses by a single run, Coach

 

Sonnichsen said, “The Florida trip
couldn't have been any better." The
Pioneers were Victorious over
Calvin, 2-1, and Hartwick, 8-4. On
the ﬁnal day the diamondwomen lost
a heartbreaker to St. Olaf. Down 5,
1 early in the game, Grinncll rallied
to a tie, only to fall 877 in extra in-
nings.

Coach Sonnichsen praised the
play of Erin Rathjen and Emily
Cripe. Rarhyen filled in on the
mound when starting pitcher Jan
Maxwell became ill early in the trip.

Softball season underway
Coach says training trip couldn’t have been better

and also hit the ﬁrst homcrrun ofthe
season. Cripe made “the defensive
play ofthe tournament" as she came
off ﬁrst base to catch a short pop ﬂy
in full extension.

“The team competed really well
the whole week. The players are
learning to make adjustments to
game situations. Despite not being
as athletic as our opponents, we hung
with them, The most importantthlng
is that they know they can compete
with the better schools," concluded
Coach Sonnichsen.

During a week-long spring break
outing in Texas. the Grinnell College
baseball team had “a great deal of fun
and demonstrated remarkably vast
improvement compared to past
years,” according to Coach Tim
Hollibaugh, who only expects things
to get better as the season progresses.
The ﬁrst test will be the Pioneers’
home opening doubleheader this Sat-
urday at 1:00 against Mount Mercy.
The sluggers will then travel to
Cornell for another twin bill Monday.

In Texas the squad played 10
games in a six-day period, compil-
ing a 2 8 record against some ﬁerce
competition

“Despite what our record shows
we played better baseball at this point
in the season than I have seen from a
Grinnell team in a while,” com-
mented Hollibaugh. “This trip was
an excellent opportunity for us to
come down and play against some
great competition. All of these
schools are already well into their
seasons and have played a signiﬁcant
number of games. By playing them,
we gain the chance to improve and
prepare for conference."

Hollibaugh praised the squad’s
performance in its 4—3 and 1175 vic-
tories over Wiley College. The im-
pressive pitching by both Joel
Cladouhos and Rob Martin were two
pleasing aspects. Each threw com-
plete games in the wins over Wiley
and demonstrated solid leadership by
going the distance.

Other team highlights included the
tying of the NCAA Division III
record for most double plays in a
single game. The Pioneers managed
six against Hardin-Simmons, but fell
in extra innings, 6-5. Michael
Munoz, Jacob Chavez, Jason Zeeh
and Cladouhos also all connected for
home—runs on the trip, Chavez also
compiled nine strikeouts against
LeTourneau University.

“This mix of youth and veterans
showed a lot of potential in Texas,"
Hollibaugh concluded. “We will
continue to focus on fundamentals
this week and strive to get as many
repetitions as possible. Both Mount
Mercy and Cornell are tough, and
will be good tests for us. [am just
pleased that everyone is so positive
and hungry to achieve.”

The soul, the body, the mind and 2:6 2
other reasons Grinnellians take on the

marathon

BY DAVID NATHAN
Staff Writer

On May 2nd, members of
Grinnell‘s Team Marathon will arrive

_ p in_ILin_c.o‘l‘n‘VI\AJebraskaw'

After a free spaghetti dinner and
a good nights sleep, Team Marathon
will rise May 3rd, run Lincoln
Nebraska‘s annual 26.2 mile mara-
thon and retum home.

Team Marathon was the brain-
child of Erin Peterson (98) and Molly
Dingel (98), who researched mara-
thons in the area over winter break.

“Molly and I found some mara—
thons near Iowa taking place in
May," said Peterson, “We researched
training. We wanted to have enough
time to prepare but also wanted to
have time to study for finals.” Team
Marathon currently consists of six-
teen women and has been training
since January. All have running ex»
perience, but few have ever run a
marathon before. Molly Dingel be-
gan running for fun in the spring of
her sophomore year and is looking
forward to Lincoln,

“I've wanted to do this for a long
time, but I didn't want to begin train
ing until I had a group to train with,"
she explained. Without a group.
Dingel feels less eager to run.

“Its harder to go out. Ican make
myself, but a lot of people use run»
ning time as social time; it gives me
a chance to talk with friends. With-
out other people, its not as much
fun.”

And training is a time consuming
activity.

In the language of the distance
runner, Team Marathon runs “long”
on Saturdays. “Long” means any-
where between 10 and 20 miles. On
Wednesdays, Team Marathon runs
half of what it ran on Saturdays and
during the rest of the week, the squad
runs various distances.

Team Marathon does not have a
formal weight training schedule or
dietary plan, however, “We drink lots
of Gatorade", said Dingel “and
we’ve tried Powerbars."

First year Sarah Reinhard is also
running with Team Marathon and
feels ninning has brought out a whole
new Side ofherself. “[A]t the beginr
ning ofthe year, I would never have
envisioned myself running lS-mile
races, but now we’ve even done that,
and are well on the way to completr
ing a marathon. I’m really excited."
said Reinhard.

Erin Peterson ‘98 (front, sccondfmm left) (mt/Moll) Dmgttl '96» (II-t) ii, itii)

Katherine Converse (Oi) has been
running sincejunior high. Nebraska
will be her second marathon.

“The average ﬁnishing time for
ﬁrst time women runners is four and
a half hours," said Converse. “My
goal this if - c is four hours even."

According to Team Marathon.
running affects living long after praCr
tice is over.

“If I go a couple of days without
running, I get antsy," said Dingel.
“It’s like I don't have enough sleep
or that something is unbalanced."

Ben Chiri (99) concurs.

Grinnell College men‘s and women‘s
track teams this week as the Pioneers
compete at Luther in a format which
features many relays.

The trackmen are coming off a
two-week training trip in Florida.
Freeman noted that his athletes coin—
peted in two meets but there were not
any really outstanding perfoinlanccs.
“We were in Florida to train so our
athletes were running tired. Our fo-
