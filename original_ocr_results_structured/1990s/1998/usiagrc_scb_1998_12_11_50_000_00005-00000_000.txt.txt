What this campus ’needs is more
Especially during this harrowt
ing week. . .offinals. -

The title of this article is a ques-
tion I ask because I'm guessing mat
your favorite campus athlete probably
needs a hug, no matter how tough,
grizzlyctoothed, and together they may
seem.

Most normal students would ad-
mit that a just a little bit of affection
would go along way towards making
their weeks better. And, since athletes
have to deal with practice, games, and
restslthnught lwould compose a list
ofgifts you can give back to your ath-
lere friends who give so much during
finals:

1. Laundry Chip (with essential
alterations). You don’t want your fa-
vorite athlete to not wear underwear,
and they can only fit so much in those
little PEC wash bags,

2. Money. Your favorite athlete
would probably like this anytime, but
it’s even more special now.

3. Surprise your favorite athlete by

' painting an honor G on their wall (for
the layperson, that is the cross that
appears on the preceding page). Abig
one. This may be time-consuming,
but it will be worth it when you see
the smile on your athlctc's face,

4. Make a mixed tape for your fa»
vorite athlete and let your true colors
shine through. This tape should con-

love.

sist solely ofsongs by Debbie Gibson,
Cindi laupcr, the banglcs, WHAM,
and Bananarama, They’re oldies but
goodies.

5, Write your favorite athlete's
twentypage term paper, No explana-
tion is necessary here.

5. A membership in the National
Wildlife Federation. Again, no expla—
nation necessary '

7. A year—long subscription to
Teen Beat. The magazine is fresh off
of its twentieth anniversary in 1996,
and now catering to a more diverse
group. It's the hottest thing around.

3. Your autographed Kirk
Cameron postcr. Giving a gift as prcc
cious as this would warm any heart.
and awarm heart is what is needed to
make it through this tough week.

9. An electric toothbrush. This
my, when your favorite athlete wakes
up late for diat nine o’clock exam, he
or she can brush their teeth (aster, thus
saving time.

10. Or, a big can of'Lysol, That
way your favorite athlete will not have
to do any laundry. A few statcgically
aimed sprays will do,

so, the next time you see someone
sporting a scarlet coat with black
sleeves, go givethemabig‘ol bearhug.
Now, it doesn‘t have to be ecstatic or
voluptiously lusty hug. That might
be kind ofconfusing. lfyou guys aren’t
at thatsort ofcomfortabiliry level, you
can just give the standard one—arm-
around—thc—shouldcr-hug and slap on
the back. That'll probably help too.

Kansas in Lawrence, 85-81

BY JAMES KRAMER
The Daily Iowan (U. Iowa)

(UchRE) IOWA CITY, Iowa .-
The game had been over for alsout 20
hours, but the thrill of victory still
emanated from the voices of Kent
Mccausland and Jacob Jaacks.

Chances are, McCausland, hacks
and their lowa basketball teammates
will never forget Tuesday night's win
over No. 10 Kansas.

Iowa (6-1) shocked the college
basketball world with its ssasi win
over the layhawks (6-2), Winning at
Allen Fieldhouse in Lawrence made
the news even more startling, sincc
Kansas had won 62 straight home
games.

"it's pretty encouraging that the
team played so poorly and was still able
to pull on the victory in one of the
toughest places to play,“ Jaacks said
Wednesday evening in a phone inter.
view. " Iowa —- the whole state .7 needed
that. It was a big win for the univer-
sity.”

The Hawkeyes didn't necessarily
deserve to win the game, but neither
did the Jayhawks. lowa turned the ball

over 31 times and once trailed by 18
points, while Kansas made just 11 of
its 23 free throws.

“We didn't play all that well, and
still came out with one ofthe biggest
victories in Hawkcyc history,“
McCausland said Wednesday. "To do
that was a big accomplishment."

It was McCausland who lifted his
team with three clutch 3-pointch late
in the game. McCausland's second-to-
last trey gave Iowa a 77.75 advantage
with 1:41 remaining, and the
Hawkeycs never relinquished the lead.

"I finally got my rhythm back a
littlc'bit," said McCausland, who led
the Hawkeyes with 15 points, "I
couldn't get my legs early. It was a
matter ofknocking one down, They
were big shots."

Jaacks, meanwhile, was just as im.
portant to Iowa's cause. The junior
college transfer came offthe bench to
score 14 points on s.of.7 shooting.

laacks, a 6-footc8 forward, also vos
the team‘s emotional sparkplug, a role
he isvery comfortable playing. He free
quently exdianged words with Kan:
sas players and occasionally exchanged
pushes and shoves with his defenders,

"1 don't like to be pushed around,"

)aacks said. "I take it personally,"

The 16,000»plus crazed fans at
Allen created another obstacle for
Iowa, Jaacks said he was the target for
most of the jetting.

"I love to be the guy most hated
by the crowd, which I pretty much was
(Tuesday) night,” he said. "They said
a lot of stuffl don‘t think you can
print. A lot of four-letter words with
my name attached.“

Iowa managed to out.rebound the
layhawks, 41.32, and was successful
on s ofll three-point attempts in the
second half,

perhaps the most impressive thing
about those numbers is the fact that
Jess Settles was essentially a noncfac»
tor. The sixth.year senior scored just
two points and ms hampered byasote
ankle. ‘

but Iowa coach Tom Davis used
his bench brilliantly, keeping his play-
ers tested and sharp for the stretch run

We talked about that, Jaacks
said We re a pretty unique team.
Every night, somebody different is
gonna step up,"

Davis, who is in his 13th and ﬁnal
season at Iowa, took the victory in
customary stride. over the years.

Davis has never gotten too high after
victories or too low following defeats.

Still, the coach couldn't deny the
significance ofa win over a top.io
opponent.

"battling from being behind the
whole game makes it even more mean—
ingful," he said. "The big thing was
just hanging in there.“

With Davis leaving at the end of
thcscason, the win in Lawrence might
end up being the game bywhich Iowa
fans best remember the coach.

Ifthat's the casc, his players wcre
glad they could be a part ofit.

“I feel like I owe so much to him
for giving me a Chance,” said
McCausland, a senior. "This is one
way to give it back to him."

" He was really at a loss for words,"

Jaacks said.

Davis‘ inability to express himself
stemmed party from the antics in the
10m locker room after the game. The
players danced the Hokey Pokey and
the noise they created was too much
for Davis to overcome, Jaaclts said.

"He didn't have a chance to get too
many words in."

U-WIRE) DURHAM, N.C. s,
Scanning the ﬁnal box score, one star
stands out glaringly. Astat that jumps
out at you and just about sums up the
entire night for Florida — Jay Heaps had
a blocked shot. Put simply, as Trajan
Langdon said, Duke was clicking on
all cylinders.

It is especially incredible consid»

in favor of UNC. The Tar Heels

But Flahcrry stepped up for the

seeded Santa Clara 1—0 in the semiﬁ»
rials on Friday. Yobc scored the win-
ning goal in that match offassists from
Fotopoulos and senior Melissa Pini.

Flahcrty said she was glad the
Gators got a chance to face the Tar
Heels in the title match instead of
Portland, which lost to UNC 1.0 in
the fourth overtime of Friday's other
semifinal match.

She said people would call this win
a fluke if the Gators beat the Pilots
instead ofthe Tar Heels.

"We knew going into the national
championship game, we all wanted to
play (North) Carolina," Flahettysaid.
"Ifyou‘re going to win a national
championship, you've got to beat the
national champion.”

And the Gators did. The seniors
have the title Butleigh told them they
had a shot at four years ago.

In doingso, UF threw a chainsaw
into one ofsports' greatest dynasties.

“It's such a storybook ending for
these seniors," Eutlcigh said.

”(When) they came here four years
ago, we had absolutely no program,
and they iust took it full-circle and win
the national championship."

door Stadium.

Will Avery led all scorers with 26
points, including a school-record eight
threetpointers, and dished out nine
assists to two turnovers against
Florida‘s pressure defense. Avery had
20 points in the first half on Geoftﬁ
shooting from three-point land,

"What William did tonight was a
special performance," coach Mike
Krzyzewski said, "It was not just in
shooting, but in clock situations, in
assist-to-turnover ratio and big de-
fense. What an unbelievable perforc
mance."

Despite Duke‘s sensational outside
shooting -16 three pointers is one shy
of a school record - the Gators never
went away, A Greg _Stolt [hrcc»pcintcr
and a pair of free throws by'Obioro
Nnaji trimmed the Duke lead, which
had been as high as 23, to just 11
points with 9:40 left in the game.

Corey Maggette then sparked a 20-
6 Blue Dev11 tun, scoring nine of his
16 points in a span of less than four
minutes. The run was highlighted by
two showastopping Maggcttc dunks,
and Dukc cruised the rest of the way,
outscoring Florida 31-14 over the ﬁ-
nal ten minutes.

Defense keyed several runs, as the
young Florida team struggled to con-
tain Duke bursts, allowing unan—
sweredruns of12, nine and 15 points.
Florida Committed l7 turnovers to 11
assists and the Blue Devils capitalized,
scoring 20 points off the Gator give—

aways.

"I think at times we really poured
on our defense," Shane Battier said.
"We didn't pin in 40 minutes ofgreat
defense, butwe deﬁnitely put it on in
spurts. At timeouts we would say,
'Okay, we're going to go on a run now.'
And that's what good teams are able
to docgo on controlled runs. We rec
ally clamped down and forced turn-
overs to go on M, loco spurts."

Duke went on its ﬁrst such run
nine minutes into the game with the
score knotted at 2}. Avery hit two free
throws. but on the ensuing Gator pos-
session, Florida sophomore btent
Wright held the rim too long on a
would-be Follow-up jam and was is-
sued a technical foul.

Langdon made both free throws
and Avery hit a three on Duke‘s pop
session. 0n Florida's next two posses-
sions, Wright traveled and then was
blocked by Maggette, which led to
anodier Avery three, and Duke sud-
denly found itselfwith a 10-point lead.

"We had some mental break-
downs," Florida coach Billy Dono‘an
said, "We didn‘t play consistently for
forty minutes... The minute you fall
asleep or don't do what‘s necessary, a
team as good as Duke is going to go
on a big, big run."

And while big runs made the game
a blowout, when the Blue Devils were
not spurring, the game was remark.
ably even. Knyzewski called the game
the closest gamcwon by big digits that

he'd ever been a part of. and in fact.
could not explain why the game was
won by such a large margin.

While Duke's ouuide shooting was
unmistakably on, the Blue Devils
struggled inside. Chris Burgess, who
has been ill, did not play in die sec-
ond half. Forward Chris carrawell
went just d—of—il and Elton Brand
shot G-of-iS. Defensively, Brand
struggled to contain Florida big man s
Udonis Haslcm,who scored 19 points
in just 18 minutes.

"i didn't come in here thinking
about playing Elton Brand," Haslem
said. “When I got die ball in my hand,
I just tried to make things happen."

And things did happen, Haslem
scored the first six Gator points, but
quickly picked up two fouls and had
to sit just two minutes into the game.
Oddly, Donovan did not bring
Haslem back until the second half,
where he scored Florida's ﬁrst eight
points ofthe half.

His efforts helped the Gators inch
back into contention, but in the end,
Duke‘s offensive fireworks were too
much for Florida to overcome.

“The one thing for me, sitting on
the sidelines, watching D‘uke's basket»
ball team what was more impressive
than anythingclscisthcymakeshots,”
Donovan said, "i thought a lot oftimes
we played some very good defense onec
onvone and they were still able to con-
vert their shots. I think that's a trib-
utc to the players in this program."
