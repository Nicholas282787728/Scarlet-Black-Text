DRAFT

BY AMANDA DESIMONE

I must admir, I am no ﬁnancial wizard, I do nor know how much money my paronrs make, or how much rhe house I grew up in costs,
or rho price ofrhe ears in our garage. Come ro rhink ofit, I don’t even know ifrhose people are really my parenrs, execpr rhar I have rliesamc
hands as rhe rnalc one. What I do know is rhar rhcy rook rhar Mencndcz brothers rrial too seriously and, as a resulr, I presenrly lack rhe
conﬁdence needed so fulfill mylife goal as aguesr on rhe Price is Right. And so I plan to meer my capsrono rcguiremenr in rhe ﬁeld ofﬁnancc
by exploring and, hopefully, berrcring Grinnell College’s ﬁnancial siruarion. Through rhis oncerinearlifetirhe opporruniry made possible by
rhe capsrone experience, I hope ro learn abour money marrers while, ar rhe same rime, giving back ro my communiry wharcvcr ir is rhar I
rook away. I've chosen Professor haroman as my sponsor for my capsrone projecr (which he has ycr ro conﬁrm), and I believe ir ries in well
wirh my major in economics (which I have yer ro declare).

Allow me ﬁrsr ro assess rhe college's ﬁnancial problems which are, unforrunarely, very serious indeed. For insrance, I’ve discovered
rhrough my research rhar Nike is oporaring a billion-dollar producrion line in Cenrral America for less rhan whar you paid for a weekeold
cookie ar rho Forum. Evidently, rhe college is rrying ro make up for irs gross deﬁcir rhrough Forum Grill fraud. Such examples ofthe college’s
ourrageous ﬁnancial difﬁculries are borh numerous and horriﬁc. Sadly, rhecoiiege can only afford ro paya single, feeble old man ro build rhe
Fine Arrs building day by day, week by week, year by year, brick by brick. Tho dozens ofyoung, agileslooking men you see hanging around
rho building are only rhere ro cheer on rhe old man wirh such inspirarional phrases as “Pick up rho pace, Feeble Old Man or no more grucl
for you!" Every rime I see this poor display, another piece ofmo dies. Anorher example ofrho colleges deterioratianrresultingrfrometheelack»
of.propor.funding is rhe random pieces ofceiling rhar keep falling inro my eye. But even rhis I can handle. What I ﬁnd mosr dishearrening
is rhar President Osgood has allowed rhe college's ﬁnancial dilﬁcuiries ro encompass every ﬁber ofhis being, even when money is nor rhe
issue as hand. At one poinr, he unconsciously uses money as a meraphor for rhe capsrono experience: “Faculty mighr ‘bank’ credir for each
capsrone proiocr up ro rwelve which could rhcn be ‘eashedein’ , . ."(Osgood, R.K,, arr-mica Collzgzrmdt/re Future, I998, 3). This Freudian
slip ofﬁscal jargon cannor be dismissed. It exposes rhe grave sraro crinnell has sunken inro, a srare rhar only rhe myrh ofa huge ondowmenr
has been able ro hide.

But enough about problems. Lcr's ralk solurions. Apparently, the phonarhon isn’t curring ir. Forrunarely, under rhe guidance of my
sponsor, I’ve developed some revolurionary fundraising techniques.

A. Allrcampus Huggers Should Provide orher Services

The all—campus lrug parricipanrs, who have already domonsrrarod rhar rhoy are more rhan willing ro ger inrimare wirh srrangers, may be
pur re use as key money-making devices. These Gtinnell gropcrs would lay down in rrafﬁc, or anywhere else for rhar marrer, if rhoy knew it
would save Gtinnell from cerrain bankruprey. The college could simply adverrise Lhe buggers and rhe services rhcy offer for monerary
compensarion on rhc Grinnell College Website under “Sporrs and Recreation” or maybe under “Service Opportunities.” I rhink it’s safe ro
say rhar rhe resulting ﬁnancial rewards would make this business venrure well worrhwhile.

B. Sell unnecessary Gtinnell Assers

“lfthou wilt be perfecr go and sell rhar rhou hasr . . . and rhou shalr have rrcasurc in Heaven" (Marrhcw, 2 I I. Narurally, I lefr our rhe parr
abeur giving to rhc poor because peoplc who are poor probably deserve ro be poor and rherefore should nor be helped cl rake rhe same
posirion on plane—crash vicrims. And, moreover, rho whole poinr ofmy rcvolurionary economic plan is to make a proﬁr. I've compiled rhe
following lisr ofmerchandisc rhe college has bur does nor need and rhus should sell: All rhose bicycles rhar are lying around, faculry house,
Norris (it will be rhe easiesr hlo the college has ever made), rhar moral rhing nexr ro rho science building, the science building, 1008 Park
street. And rhis is just off the rep ofmy head.

 

 

 

l’r_ All Boils Down To

BY MEGAN JONES

In the weeks leading up ro rbc illustri-
ous srrerch ofrimc known as ﬁnals week, I
ﬁnd rhar I share a common bond wirh my
fellowstudcnts, us nor rhe lare nighrs, rhe
rime spcnr in from ofrhe compurer, or the
numerous cups of coffee consumed
rhrougbour rhc days in a vain arrempr ro
sray awake.

No, rhc unmisrakable somerhing of
which I'm wriring is bigger rhan all ofrhose
rhings. Give up? Since your mind is prob.
ably roo,rired ro come up with a clever an-
swer and because youIIre probably gerring
annoyed with all orhis game-playing, I’ll roll
you. The overarching rheme in all ofour
lives right now is STRESS.

Simply glancing ar rho word causes my
brearhing ro quicken and my hearr ro
pound a little fasrcr. It seems rlrar no
amounr of caioling, pleading, crying, or
screaming can banish rhis irriraring pres-
once from our lives. It's really quire amaz—
ing so think abour how we function in rhis
harried armosphorc ar rhis rimc ofycar, For
me (and I’m guessing many orhers from 'my
own observarions), cxisring under
STRESSful condirions requires a cafﬁnarcd
beverage ofsome sorr. My choice is coffee.
Rich, srrong, black coffee, cirhcr from rhe
Forum or my own coffee por. There is no
life wirliour coffee. I think ihars called an
addiction,

Anyway, ro ger back co the ropic. Ah
ycs STRESS STRESS nor only brings on
binge cafﬁnarion due ro a lack ofslecp, .r
also b'ccomes rhe eenrcrpiccc of rho con»
versarions rhar now occur bcrwccn my fel.

sonal observarion, bur I have a fcelingl am
far from being alone when I say rhar all I
talk abour is my work, i.c. how much, due
dares, number ofpagcs ro bc wrirrcn, pro»
fessors, and when it Will all be over. Now,
one migbr say, ihar's norhing new. We al-

ways talk abourrharsruffarcrinnell. And

I'd have ro agree. But it seems ro me rhar
rhese days rhcreUs a sense of panic laced
rhrough rhe discussions, along with a di-
mension of animosiry roward rhe insriru.
rion in general

The STRESS- induced illnos isanodiet con-
sequence of rhis anxious time. You know, that
(old you just ain‘t kick, die fever that won't seem
ro go away, rhe sore Lhroat rhar oonu'nues ro
plague your days and highs? The illnesses al»
ways seem ro srriko righr before and/or during
finalsweek. Succumbing to disc maladies rein-
foreesyourmorher'sbeliefrhar even rhougayou
spend mosr ofrhcyear 1,000 miles from home,
you srill cannor rake mre of yourself At rhe
same time that your body is battling flu-$6 ill-
noses in rheir various forms, you are also slav-
ing away in from ofacompurer, trying ro make
rhar 5:00 paper dcadlinc. There is no such rhing
as convalesconoe, Are you kidding?

Iwould posir rhar a lack ofslecp is ans
orher aspecr ofSTRESS, cxccpr rhar we all
suffer from a lack ofslcep ar various rimcs
during rhe semester. Yes, as I srarcd before,
there’s a kind of frenzy lurking in our eyes
and inourvoiccs. Sleep becomes rhar much
more impracrical and rhar much more cov.
ered, I don'r have rime ro do somerhing as
minimal as sleep. I'm supposed ro be think»
ing abour rhc rhemes in Dosroeyfsy, undcre
sranding differenrial equarions, and pon-
dcnng rhc meanings oflifc in order ro write
a ﬁftccnepagc paper on rhe subiccr.

Even rirough I always endure rliese hell.
ish weeks, I can never recollocr just how I
made it. I think we've developed a set of
Survival skills in order to make it to the end
of the week that include wakefulness (or
some semblance ofit) for hours on and,
Sludy breaks only ro do rhe necessary rhings
like showering or caring, and exercise by
climbing rhe srairs in ARH in order to gcr
to our classes. Like Dorothy ianhe Wiz—
nttl til 02," I, too, have mantra: Just hang
on until break.

 

C. Mandatory Train Toll

I envision a day when rho college makes rhc rrain pay a loll ro pass rhrough campus. The roll fee can vary from day ro day, Perhaps one
day it will be a good day for rhe college and cherofore mo rrain will only have re pay 3 I. Bur maybe an anorher day ARH will need a new
window and rhe roll will be $75,800. It will all really depend on rhe college’s ﬁnancial srarus ar rhe rimc of rhe rrain's arrival. Also, ir would
be wise ro make rho rrain pay a penalry foo ofno less man $10,000 for each rim. it sounds irs obnoxious horn ar 3 am.

D. Put rho Lawyer to Work

My research in rhe area ofﬁnanco has lead to my discovery rbar lawyers make a Ior of money, especially fancy ones who arrended Yale Law
School. So my ﬁnal proposal is rhar rho college ser President osgood up wirh a pracriee as soon as possible. Ferhaps rhis is roo lofry an idea,
in which case he could always sell ﬁne curlery door ro door. And so iris ar rhis rime rhar I do beseech you President Osgood, ro ger our rhere

and apply your law school skills Sacriﬁce for rhe berrer good Do ir for Swarrh

Discussion Quesrions

I. Do your parenrs make a Ior ofn-Ioney? So what?
2. Have you ever used someoncclsc’s laundry derergenr in Loose laundry room _and I mean awhole Iorewirhour asking permission?

Ifso, do you realize that you’re going ro hell? Explain.

Letters To the Edi’ro‘r -I._

Dear Edi ror,

It is with shod< and utter disbelief that
we read that most heinous letter from Mr.
Tor G. Erickson and Mt, Erik D. B. Ander»
son ofrhree weeksago. How dare rhoy call
for rhe removal ofonc ofrhe shining pillars
ofthis grand and glorious insrirurion, Mr.
Srephen A. Btiscoe? Because oer, Briscoe

wirhour our beloved cherry red Blazer with

where.

Thar said, our only concern is rhar
crinnell's shock rroops may do rheir job too
well, robbingour precious college ofirsdis.
tinctivc mirthful collegeness and making
rheir jobs moor in rho process. we foresee
a day, nor roo very far in rhe furure, when

wirh who; and when (gaspl) our continu»
ing onrollmcnr fund will no longer be nec»
cssary ro pay for incvirable damage ro come

Therefore, we propose a simple srop ro
ensure rhar rho proper balance efgood and
evil, socuriry and mirrh, is mainraincd in

Greek systcm. The addirion ofa frarerniry

ro guaranree rliar our securlry force will be
around for a long, long, looooooong rime

In addition ro providing ‘roundcrhe.

provide rraining in rhe rudimcnrs ofproper

Greek College or GreekCo. Some of
GteekCo’s offerings would include: Malt
Liquor is Everywhere, 4:20 And You, Dans
for ocsrrucnon, and Stealing; It's' Really
Fun!

quire frankly we are surprised rhar
this Idea was not included in Russell “Spe-

Dear Editor,

I am grearly confused abour rhe pic—

is obviously nor ofrhe presidcnr, bur ofa
rorally sepcrare person, whom I rend ro
like. If you were going ro pur this par-
ricular picrure of Coach Knight in rho
ariricle, you could have as lcasr referred to
him by making some sorr of sraremenr
abour how he, iusr as Clinton, is crazy.

But rhar would be srupid. Srupid because
