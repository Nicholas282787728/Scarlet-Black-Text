' ' Coach Jenny Wood after the Grinncll

College women's basketball team

,lost two more tough Illalcheups last

week, The Pioneers were downed

by Lake Forest. 71-61, and then

' - beaten by St. Norbert, 75-59 The

Against Lake Forest the lioopstcrs

of the first period, leading by 11
points at the break
. - “1 was extremely impressed with
our first half," remarked Wood, “We
played tremendously against their
defensive pressure and we executed

ell."

Senior Sally Goodspeed got the
team started off by bucketriig eight
ouick points. Thls proved to be a big
help because it set the tone and gave
the team an important lift, However.
it did not take long for the Foresters

- to deflate the Pioneer lead ill the soon

' one half.

“It was like night and day," Wood
slated. “We came out iii the second
period and could not follow our game
plan. Once again, it was disappoint-
log to see a lead disappear. We need
to stay mentally focused to prevent
this outcome in the future."

‘ Liz Graf ‘01 , Carrie Brownell ‘01.
