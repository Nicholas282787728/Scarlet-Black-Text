Fifth—ranked Tigers roll over Winterset

Justin Jansen breaks school record for career rushing total

by KRISTI NIXON
sports Editor

A not so beautiful night for Hotne-
coming still produced a fantastic sight
for Grinnell Tiger fans to see,

Fifth-ranked Grinncll defeated

- winterset, 34,7, to remain unbeaten at
5.0 and produced a recordahreiiking
night forstarrunning hack Justiannsen.

Jansen, who rushed for228 yards on
20carries, which allowed him to break
the Tiger career rushing total set by
Seth Wallacein 1995-6. Fi-idayniglit‘s
total gave him 2,005 yards mshing for
his career, which eclipses Wallace's
total of 1,972 yards with four regular
season games remaining.

“Justin’s a ﬁne athlete,“ Coach Jim
Dunne said. “He‘s had a quality offer-k
siveline to run behindlast yearandthis
year. it is the people up front who have
helped him to get this total and he
would be the ﬁrst one to recognize his
offensive line."

Jansen accounted for three of the
Grinnell touchdowns while Jack
Whitver ran in the other two...

Currently. Grinnell istied for the top
of the district with Chanton, which
also boasts an undefeated record of 5-
0 overall, 3-0 in District 6.

The Tigers travel to play Oskaloosa

The impending arrival ofthe Motor
loway caravan of restored vehicles
whichwill pausebi‘ieﬂyinGrinncll on
Friday and the unearthing ofsome old
highwaysignsattheformerlowaHigh»
way Commission garage on Highway
146 South has led to some conjecture
about the numbering of highways
which run through Grinncll.

Inclearingoutthegaragelastyearto
turn it into an ofﬁce for Criswell
Enterprises, what should appear but a
stash ofthe original iron signs which
marked highways before the advent of
the stamped metal signs which now
tell us where we are.

His curiosity piqued by the signs,
which includcdone foraHighway 32,
Daryl Morrison, a Criswell employee,
contacted the library at the Depart~
mentofTransportation in Ames, where
heleamedthat Highwayszwas one of
the original ﬁve primary roads in lowa
andthat itdid indeed go through Grin-
nell. It ﬁrst was graded in 1921, then
graveled in 1924 and 1925,

In l928 it was paved and in early
1931or‘32itbecameUSHighwayG,
presumablywhcn the federal highway
system was dcvclopcd.

The route has changed some over
the years, says Morrison, wlto lives
west ofCrrinnell and recalls that High~
way 6 at one time went south of its
present route. Old timers also recall
thatatonctimeHtghwayéwcntstmight
ahead west chrinncll through Sugar
Creek Hill rather than turning south
past what now is called the Gilinan
Road.

The heavy metal signs, some of
which have been shared with other
auto buffs are wonderful to behold,
says Morrison. The ones he chose to
work with wcrc nrst sandblasted by
Doug See bcforc he himself painted
them to go with his collection of li-
ccnsc plates.

isn't progress wonderful?

Highway 6, also known in Grinncll
as Sixth Avenue, may dominate the
travel scene at this time but Fourth

Avenue at one time was the route of the
famous River to River Road, a route
from the Mississippi to tltc Missouri
River and vice vcrsa.

Italso was the route of a famous road
race in the early l900s involving n
Spauldingautomobilemanufacturedin
Grinnell which raced a fast Rock is-
land mail train across the state froitt
east to west.

Thatroad race was re-cl cated iii l996
when Curt Connell of Lincoln, Neb.. a
rcscarcherandauthoroncnrlyautomor
biles, drove the route in a restored
automobile, not a Spnulding, to see
how fast he could drive the mute,

An enigma involves that route:
Painted high up on the north side oftlrc
building on the Southwest corner of
Fourth Avenue and Broad Streetacross
from Brenton Bank is what appears to
be another highway sign: a miniature

highways except that it uwolvcs the

So it would appear, based on proceedings this week in the House Judiciary
Committee and the scheduled vote by the full House on whether to open a
formal inquiry ofnnpcachment. According to virtually every report, the
House cop is virtually monolitltic on this particular topic, The same prob-
ilbiy isn’t true of Democrats, because sortie are likely to go along with the
inquiry, because it makes political sense for them to do so —- particularly

when it's obvious that no Dernor
cratic alternative resolution will get
any considcraiion.

Some suggest that people ought
to be wary ordrawing conclusions
based solely 0n_thtt happcns in the
Judiciary Cottimittcc. It has been
called the most partisan ofany
House committee, and that‘s-
probably true. Despite a pretense of
being fair and accommodating,
everything has happened strictly

iilrtng party lines so far, and that isn’t likely to change. ,

So what will happcn'iThc scenario seclns prclty much in place. Once the
House votes to accept the lut' ' ry Committee‘s recommendation and
formally launches the inquiry. hearings will begin. The networks wrll carry
the lrcnr ings livc, jusl us they did during the ploccctlings against Ricltitrd
Nixon 25 yous ago. But this congressional panel docsrrt cvcrr resemble the
one that dealt with Water-gale. That committee truly did work itt a bipartisan
fashion. So what ts likely is a round ot‘hcarings designed for maximum
political effect. Ultimately, according to former Prcsrdcnt Jimmy Carter and
others, the colnllllltce will vote out ilt’thiCS ofitttpcttclttticnl, and the full
House probably will concur, sending them to the Senate for trial. There,
perhaps coulcl heads will prevail.
