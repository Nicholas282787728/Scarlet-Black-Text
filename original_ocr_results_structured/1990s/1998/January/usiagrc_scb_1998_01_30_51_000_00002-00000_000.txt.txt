Volunteer language teachers
sought for after-school program

The After School Foreign Lane
guage Program (ASFL) e a joint
effort between college students,
Grinnell third—graders, their parents
and teachers, arid the Grinnell Col»
lege Community Center 7 is cur
reiitly seeking students to volunteer
as language teachers for the spring
semester.

Thcscclassesintroducelanguages
other than English to area elemene
tary school kids, increasing global
awareness and creating enthusiasm
for foreign language study. In the
fall I997 semester, l7 Grilrnell Coir
lege students and 43 Grinnell third
grader from three elementary
schools participated in the program.

The program offered classes in
Spanish. French, Gemian, Russian
and Chinese that meet weekly on
campus. The role of the college stun
dent teachers is to introduce basic
vocabulary to kids in small interacr
tive groups, through games and art
projects. These classes, which are

free to thirdvgraders, give the local
students a fun encounter with a lair-
guage, in hopes that they will cori-
tinuetakingforeignlanguagcclasscs
ill the future. ASFL volunteers also
provide the younger students with
exposure to other cultures and tradi-
tions, giving themaposrtive intcracr
tion with College students from all
over the world.

Sothe nexttime you hear an elghlr
yearrold on campus pointing out the
word for “bathroom“ in French,
“tree" in Russian, or counting to ten
in Chinese » that’s the ASFL kids
and teachers.

If you’d like to get involved, sign
up to teach a section this semester.
ASFL classes meet on campus once
a week from 3:304:30, either Mon-
day, Tuesday, Wednesday orThurs-
day. and will offer any language you
sign up to teach — come voliinleer'

ASFL hopes to start the program
