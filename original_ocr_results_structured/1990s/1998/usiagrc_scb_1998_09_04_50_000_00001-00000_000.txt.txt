Rosenfield Symposium brings experts from diverse backgrounds to
explore conflict resolution through the lens of Northern Irish politics

BY MOLLY GARDNER
Arts Editor

When rhe General Assembly ofNorrhern
irelanri meers for rhe hrsr nine nerr week in
liclfasr, a symposium oi five speakers from
various Irish organisarions will also be moor-
ing rogerher ar Grinneli.

The synrposrrrm, enrirled Can/[in Rees/ii.
iron in jVnrt/mn ire/void, is rnrended “(0 give
all ofrhe groups . . . an opporrrrniry ro ralk..
land] ro give our eonrnrurriry an opporruniry
ro respond," said lan ,CIcchowski, professor
ofTheare-i- ar Grinnell.

Genesis of die symposium began in 1997,
when Czechowski arrcndcd ihe Universiry or
ulsrer for a weekdong seminar over-rho eon-
llicr in Norrhern 1rc1and,

The seminar, said Czcciiowskl, broughr
rogerhcr “various speakers and ofﬁcials rnlke
ing aboirr rheir posiiions and rhe whole siiuae
Lion.”

inspired by rhe formar, Czechowski re-
rurned to Grirrnell and proposed rhe idea for a
similar seminar ro rhe Rosenﬂeld program in
Public Affairs, inrcrnarional Relanons and
Human Righrs. The Rosellﬁcld Program
agreed m rake on sponsorship,

Now, prominenr ﬁgures from a wide speca

rrrrrn ofgrorrps are ready ro speak ro members
of Grinneli and surrounding conimrrniries
abour sueh issues as rhe Troubles, rlre Good
Friday Agreemenr, and rlre forrnarion of rho
Norrhern ireland General Assembly. This are
rangemenr provides a comprehensive informa.
rive leeruie or all audience members,

To each ropic, Czechowski believes eaeh
speaker will bring a difierenr perspective

“The basie idea was so bring in speakers
from borh sides ofrhe issue: from rhe Union-
isr side and theyNutionaIisr sidcx'

Czechowski says rhar allowing borh sides
equal nine is especially imporranr beearue “rhe
Unionisrs, who do nor wanr a rinired ireland
hrirwanr ro remain wirh rhe Unired Kingdom,
have nor had rhc same forum in rhe Unired
Srares rhar orher groups involved in rhe con-
flier have had.”

caechowski also planned ro include voices
from separaie camps wirhin rho Unionrsr and
Narionalisr sides.

Party, while Dennis Regan will speak ior rhe
more moderare Ulsrer Unionisr Parry,

Though all four parry members are in-
volved in rhe peace ralks, Czechowskl srressed
rhar rhey “are nor professional polirieians; drey
work on rhe grass roars level for rheir parry. , .
a [Eaeh] has a life rhar involves a career, bur
they're very cornmirred to polirical life as well
as ‘normal life.”

Thus, Czecliowski believes rhe speakers will
provide insighr rhar cxtcnds beyond “sound
bites.”

For chem,po1ieics are "much more close ro
home because ofrhe violence"

Addirionally, rwo speakers unamliared wirh
oirher side will offer vicwpoints: barbara
Mccabe, a co—iounder of rho Norrhern Ire-
land Women’s Coalirion, and John Mccarry,
a professor oipolirical science ar King’s Cole

Though MeCabe’s organizarion does nor

“proacrivcx'

The coalirion is nor poliricalenor Union-

Czechowski said that many women from
Norrhern ireland are involved in such organi.
varions.

MeGarry, who will deliver Thursday's con-

vocarion, has done eonsiderobie research on
rhe corrflrers and is errrrenrly Cudvriting rwo

Afrer rho sixleciurcs,1he i,inposirim will
conclude wirh a panel discussion wherein a
small group ofsrudenrs and faeulry members
will pose ouesrions for some of she speakers
from rhe audience.

originally, Czechowski had inronded ro ser
up a “round table dcbare" including all rhe
speakers, bur he soon realized “(his wouldn'r
work "

The problem is rhar die urrionisrs will nor
share a plarform wirh Sinn rein because Sinn
Fern is considered a . . . rcrrorisr organiaarion.
[Tire Unionrsrsl will nor recognize [Sinn Fein]
as a lcgrrimare polincal enriry." Thus, rhe ar.
r-angemcnrwill allow forall rhe speakers in rhc
