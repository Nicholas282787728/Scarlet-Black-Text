S’ruden’r-wri’r’ren ploy ’ro
debu’r ClI Bob's

BY MOLLY GARDNER
Arts Editor

When a preliminarystaging ofrhe
play, vim Harte/f debuts this Saturv
day at Bob's, audience members will
not be rhe only ones arriving with few
clues ofwhar lo erpecr. in her, au.
rhor Donomn Sherman '01 may also

be surprised by the performance, since -

he has not given input into staging
since he rurned the play’s direction
over to “compatriot" Katrina Bugaj
'01.

Exclusion from the direcring pro.
cess was intentional. According to
Sherman, the production is intended
as a “workshop” which might allow
him to gauge audience reactions and
view his own work with objectivity.
Thus, said Sherman, “this isn’t a the-
atrical presentation. ..ir’s a reading pr:v
senred as a play."

still, the reading will not preclude
some physical movement and props.
The action is divided into three scenes,

two ofwhich unfold in rt restaurant,
The cast consists of three characters
played by Jesse McClelland ‘01, Jodi
Zicscmcr '0! and Emily Sal-laklan '02.
According to Sherman, the theme
hinges around “how over intellectual»
nation can ravage one's ability to be
human."

Though sherman began writing
the play in high school, rlre revision
process lacked impetus until Bugaj ofr
fered her assistance last spring. “This
was always in the background," said
Sherman. "Then l lent the script to
Katrina last year...she went to New
York [to attend a playwrinng work-
shop over the summer] and had it
read."

Eugaj's experience in New York
prompted her to suggest holding an-
other reading back in Grinnell. “She
said, ‘why don’t we have it read here?”
said Sherman.

Explained Bugaj, ”He has to see it
without his influences-o he can see
[any] problems.“

Already, discussions with bugaJ
have promped Sherman to make scv»
eral changcs: said Bugaj, "Just irom
last year, it’s evolved a bit."

Aside from showing him how a
director might stage his play, the read.
ing is also intended to allow Sherman
to gather direct audience input. “I
encourage people...ro offer me feed-
back, criticism, comments, whatever.
1 just wanted to hear people’s opina
ions.”

Reflecting on how collaboration
ofren contributes to the creative effort.
Bugaj said, “It's important that [the
workshop process] happens more
hererthat people collaborate—so that
rhey can help enhance each others
work."

Added Sherman, “More of this can
happen here. it’s so easy."

The reading will be at Bob’s on
Saturday, October 5, ar 9 p.m.

HardBailetl is this weeks Hong

ARH 502), shown in connection
with CorcySIaglc’s EXCO class. It’s
alohn Woo action ﬂick, with Chow
Yun Fat, and 1 don't feel especially
qualiﬁcd to comment on it, but
somconc with morc cxpertise de-
scribed it as “thc bcst action film
ever made." In case you can’t make
it this Tuesday, despair not: I heard
somc rumors that our wonderful
Films committee is bringing this
very piece to Harris in a few weeks.

Shall WrDam‘z.’ is about a hard-
working Tokyo accountant whosc
mundane life is shaken up one night
on his ride home, when he spots a
lovely woman in die window of a
dance studio. Infatuatcd by her, he
signs up for dance lessons at the
school. From the opcning prologue,
wc lcarn that in Japan, whcrc pub-
lic displays oraffection are consid-
ered scandalous (cvcn married
couples don’t embrace in public!),
dancing is sham=ful and cntircly
contrary to the rigid social norms
and the traditional Japanese sense
of rescrvc. Undcr such circum-
stances, the hcro —- whose namc I
can’t seem to remember ~ dccidcs
to keep this csmpadc sccrct from his
coworkers and wifc. Eventually, she
becomes suspicious or his late
chncsday nights, and hires a pri—
vate dctcCtivc to followhim. On rlic
surface, Shall We Dam is a Fairly
light, feel-good comedy, almost
Hollywood-convcntional, yet with
the story of a shy person drawn to
something that he scnscs can make
him ftccr and happicr. It is a real
charmer.
