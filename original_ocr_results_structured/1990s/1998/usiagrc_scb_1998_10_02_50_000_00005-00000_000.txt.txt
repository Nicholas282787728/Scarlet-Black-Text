Anochronism finds itself a

“The bushes they bite me
The ground it does smite me.
And everything here

is as dry as a bone,

My thoughts are returning

To the land ofthe Falcon.

Green Calontir,

Oh my temperate home."

Who sings this? What is
Calontiri The Society for Cree
ative Anachronlsm (SCA) can an-
swer these questions and more.
iessica Dvorak ‘99 and president
of the SCA, says that people al.
ways wonder who rhe SCA is.
“We’re an underground group you
don’t really know about, " she
says. In fact, the SCA is not col-
lege-centered, but is spread world»
wide.

The SCA was founded in Cali-
fornia thirty-three years ago, and
it has been at Grinncll for seven-
teen years. “The goal is to accu-
rarely rerenact the Middle Ages
and Renaissance time period,”
Dvorak says “It’s essentially hav—
ing fun while learning."

“You're encouraged to research
the history and create a persona
from a specific time period and
country,” she continues. This in-
cludes creating appropriate Cloth-
ing to wear, researching a proper
period name, and more. The goal
is to join into rhe medieval activi-
ties, and “to live as medievally as
possible while having fun,” as
Dvorak puts it. They Strive to-
ward called the
“dream," when everything feels
rruly real.

a moment

“A community develops
within the groups," she describes.
People typically starr‘out in the
group as commoners, but they
can assume titles through fight-
ing, learning, or service merit,
Three SCA members at Grinncll
have achieved the ranks of Lady
or Lordi

Within the group, many
events take place. Fighting and
medieval dancing occur on cam.
pus weekly, music practice is
monthly, people work on period
clothing as needed, and there are
other less frequent, spccial
events. Most events take place on
weekends.

TheSCA is curremly planning
a trip to Harvest fair for the ﬁrst
weekend offall break, beginning
October 17. It will include a
feast, but with accurate period
food. Foreramplc, this European
feast won’t have “new world"
foods like potatoes, corn and
chocolate.

The aboveecited verse is song
to the tune of“Streets ofLorador“
The SCA often takes modern
tunes and writes songs in she me-
dieval style for them. The entire
song was inspired by an event
when the SCA went from here to
the New Mexico desert, decked
out in the hot, many-layered Eu-
ropean clothing, true to charac-
ter.

“It was lots of fun," Dvorak
says, though it did have some
mishaps. “Someone ran into a
cactus and someone else got sand
in her eye and had to wear a
patch," she describes,

Many of the local people at

that event were in Middle Eastern
character, which reinforces how
the SCA is world-oriented.
Dvorak herself learned middle
eastern dancing (belly dancing),
pirates lot offa cannon cvcry so
often, and everyone participated
in other fun activities.

Events for the SCA occur in
many difrerenr parts ofrhc United
states because the SCA is spread
throughout the states in separate
kingdoms, and there are special
events, or wars, when different
kingdoms comc togcthcr. Iowa,
Missouri, Nebraska, and part of
Kansas comprisc rhc Calonrir
kingdom,forexamplc,whllchw
Mexico and a couple neighboring
states form the Outlands. There
are also shircs within kingdoms;
Grinnell itself is the college of
NoMountain.

The next big event that the
SCA will host occurs in April.
Dvorak says they are hoping to
have a coronation, but have yet to
schedule anything solidly,

Dvorak also mentions how inc
tcrcsting and different the broad
spectrum ofpeople under the ban»
net ofthe SCA is. She's seen law-
yers, doctors, construction work-
ers, managers of 7»l l, and more.

“The mix of people always
amazes me. You never know who
you’re talking to," she comments.
She adds rhat anyone can join the
SCAatanytime. "Ifyoul‘lavezny
interest in the Renaissance or
Middle Ages, there's a niche for
you somewhere," she says.

New Tope-Heods ClUb
shores ’rhe weol’rh of

live recordings

By NATHAN WELLER
Sraif‘Writcr

Many Grinnell students like to
consider themselves connoisseurs of
THC. But how many can say that they
really know what it is, or what its funo
tion is on campus,>

Anyctudenr at Grinnell who is an
avid rape collector is most likely well
aquaimed with the acronym THC.
For THC, which stands for Tape.
Heads Club, is a newly developed or-
ganization that promotes tape trading
as a hobby at Grinncll.

For rhe common music fan unfa.
miliar with the rape trading philoso-
phies, THC may be a complete mys.
tery Many questions rnighr arise, such
clszwhal is the purpose of’l‘HC?Why
are tapes such a big deal? And, most
importantly, why do peoplc enjoy
THC?

Anyone who enjoys the diversity
and distinguishing qualities of live
music is probably familiar with tape
trading as an enjoyable hobby, and as
a way to experience various musical
groups at their ﬁncsr. Tape-heads be-
lievc that the live experience ofa mu»
sical group is more valuable than its
studiowork, thus making recorded live
concerts and jam sessions a highly
prized commodity.

Live music has an entirely differ.
ent feel than studio recording," said
Brian Turner ‘02, one ofthe organiz.
ers ofTHC. "you get to experience
how die band functions, without the
hindrances produced by the non-im-
provisarional and impersonal studio
environment.”

Many bands, such as Phish, string
cheese incident, The Grateful Dead,
Bob Marley and the Allman Brothers
Band allow the recording oftheir live
performances in order to harbor a
strong fan base. Many ofthese bands
which condone live recordings do not
necessarily yield a large studio album
audience, and therefore rely upon the
distribution of nonproﬁt perfor—
mance recordings to broaden their live
audience.

“The band feels that their live au-
dience will increase if they allow
people to record their performances,"
said Turner. “For many bands, the live
experience deﬁnitely sets them apart."

These live rapes are rhen placed
into the tape trading community,
which consists of a network of tape
traders who spread rhe recordings
amongst each other. trading rapes back

and forrh, and generally enjoying great
hard—ro—find live music.

“It’s great that musicians such as
Bob Marley and The Grateful Dead
see the value orallowing the public to
record their shows," said Laura
Makinen ‘02, a founderofTHC, “The
music is what is mosr important.”

This is where THC comes in. By
establishing an organized tape—trading
nerwork on Grinncll campus, experi»
enced tapehcads as well as newcom»
ers can have access to literally thou—
sands ofhours ofcxccprional live mu»
sic. “Our goal is to promote the trad-
ing ortapcs and a to promote people
having good taste in music," said or»
ganizer and Josh Weiland ‘02, in re-
gard to the goals ofTHc.

The concept ofTHC is the brain
child of Paul Robarc ‘01, who came
up with the idea last year, but lacked
sufficient student backing and inter-
est.

“It was a thought i had last year,
but it never really happened. Josh and
laura were rhe push to get rhc club
off rhc ground," he said. “There are
also a lot ofrapeheads in the first year
class to get things going."

one of the major goals ofTHC,
besides spreading diverse music
throughout campus, is the establish-
ment ofa rape vault, in which students
could check our tapes and make rc-
cordings on their own. This archive
could also be available for future gen-
erations ofGrinncll students.

Last year, Robarc inquired into
putting a vault in the KDIC studios,
but was unfortunately turned down.
“We talked to KDIC last year," he said,
“but were turned away because ofthe
threat ofthe FCC and its regulations
about holding live tapes."

Getting the club up and running
this year was another story entirely.
THC's first intention was to acquire
space at burling to hold their vast tape
archive. Ar first, library personnel were
supportive and excited about the idea,
and felt that it would be a positive
addition. Then, the fear ofcopyrighr
infringement, bootlegging and legal
complicarionsofholding hundreds of
live recordings scared them away They
felt that the college might get into
trouble by having 'tapes of live con-
certs available for student use, The AV
Center also turned THC down for the
same reasons.

“The library and AV Center said
that individuals can keep and record
these rapes," said Turner, "but an es;

rablishment cannor,"

The major concern of the college
is the threat of illegal bootleg tapes
ﬁnding their way into the archive.
Certain artists such as Bob Dylan and
Jimi Hendrix, are commonly boot—
legged, and could very easily become
a part ofTHC’s collection. According
to Robare, however, this probably
wouldn’t happen.

“We atTHCwouId have complete
control of what comes into our
archive," he said. “The powers that be
just don’t trust us."

Right now, THC has a hard copy
list of all their tapes on the interncr
for other tape-heads to browse, and
then order selections through email.
This tapertradlng network is a more
probable solution for the club, accord»
ing to Robare.

“it would be great to have a physi-
cal archive of tapes on campus," he
said, "but an on.line network is more
realistic.’Y

The number ofTHc members on
campus is growing, according to
Robare, which will ultimately increase
the size ofrheir combined collection.

“Tapers tend to be hippies, and
hippies are lazy, but people are join-
ing slowly but surely,” be said. “our
ultimate goal will be to get every tape
on campus into our archive."

THC is a most certainly awelcome
edition to the clubs and organizations
at Grinnell. By providing a vast tape
ing network to borrow and record
tapes, students who are curious about
such bands as The Dead and string
Cheese Incident have access to some
great live music, and old tape.heads
can erpand their collections.

“Tl-[C is totally open ro people
who are interested in taping, even if
rhey don’t have any rapes," said
Robarc. “We want to get everyone in
on it, and spread this great live music
rhroughout campus."

Even Makinen is also excited about
getting THC offthc ground. “I’m re.
allygoingtoenjoysceingourtapecol»
lection grow,” she said. ”Everyone
should join THC. with a lot ofgreat
live tapc collections on campus, there
is so much great music to be shared."

THC is definitely for everyone,
even those with little knowledge oflive
music. Those curious aboutTHc and
rheir music should VAX {TAPES}. The
club promises no ill effects in the
morning.

Yogo: the force is strong
It ’s Not Just Flexibility Anymore

By MATT SWESSINGER
StaffWrirer

Yoga is takingcrinnell College
by storm, but it’s not just about
contorrion anymore.

This year a Yoga group, led by
John Cummins ’01, has been
meeting three times a week on
campus, Cummins said, “The
group exists primarily to give
people a venue to relax and grow."
This may come as a surprise to
those who think of yoga as put-
ring your legs around your head
and levitating into the air,

Cummins resents this percep—
tion of yoga. He said, “When
most people think of yoga, they
think of Hatha yoga, the yoga thar
works mainly on ﬂexibility. How»
ever, yoga is bigger than that. it
is an allccncompassing discipline
involving meditation, relaxation,
activism and general lifestyle im-
provcmentr"

“yoga centers one in body and
ﬂexibility to prepare one for this
world or the new level," Cummins
said, “and this preparation also inr
cludcs thc csorcric aspects of
yoga." Cummins usually works
on Harha yoga during class and
assigns meditation as homework.

Emma Drake ‘02, a student of
the class, said, “This week he
asked the class to drink more wa-

ter and to practice ﬂexibi ty 15
minutes daily. it's very relaxing."

Cummins feels that service is
an important part of yoga and
hopes to include it as an aspect of
the curriculum. “I plan ro take a
group to Planned parenthood to

do some good there. As a
Women'sStudicsmajor,itscemed
like the perfect project," said
cummins.

Cummins has been studying
yoga since he was in diapers.
Cummins said, “When l was three
years old, lwas rampaging around
the house and being a general
pain. so my mom sent me to the
library. In the children’s section
rhc librarian gave me this book on
yoga for kids. I thought that it
was neat because all of the people
in the book were in funny posi.
rions. lcouldn't do rhcm at first
so I workcd hard at it.” For
Cummins, yoga has become a
passion ever since.

To increase his knowledge of
the discipline Cummins has read

Patanjali, Hindu texts, as well as
some modern authors.

students are enthusiastic about
the class. Talea Townsend ‘01.
said, “I had done some reading on
yoga before 1 took the class, and I
was happy to be able to further my
studies. John is so approachable
and very supportive."

Drake said, “it is nice to go to
the class and enjoy an hour ofro-
laxation. llikc how John empha-
sizes both aspects of yoga.”

The class meets three times a
week. There is one chance to join
remaining: Saturday at 7 pm.

The class is meeting at the Re-
ligiousAcrivitics room. lfanyonc
else wants to begin the class, this
will be their last opporruniry.

“We'd like to take everyone
that wants to join, but they
wouldn’t get the full effect of rhc
class. yoga is a progressive disci-
pline," said Cummins.
