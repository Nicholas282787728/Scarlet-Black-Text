Reviews

BY ZORKA MlLtN

 

Hair/d drum is a cult classic
comedy about the most unlikely romantic
couple ever to hit the big screen. Harold is a
rich teenager whose greatest joy in life comes
from staging suicides. He is clearly death—
obsessed, but his socialite mom believes he's
just going through a phase, She decides he
just needs to meet the right girl who would
help him settle down, so she applies to a dur-
ing service on his behalf Harold manages to
frighten away all prospective dates. And when
he isn‘t busy hanging or drowning or stab.
bing himself, Harold goes to funerals for fun.
This is how he meets Maude, a eharming,
eccentric, lifc-loving 79-year»old who likes to
steal vehicles and pose in the nude. Harold
falls for Maude and decides to marry her.

Although l didn‘t expect to (the story does
sound a bit sappy does it not?) 1 have to ad»
mit I like this him, a lot. 1 don‘t know who
was the actress that played Maude, but she
did a great job, and ofcourse, the whole thing
wouldn't work at all without her. To be fair,
the role ofHarold and especially that ofhis
mother were acted brilliantly as well.

in one interview, the playwright (btw. this
was originally written as a theater play) said,
"We'rc all Harold and we all want to be
Maude. We're all repressed and trying to be
free, to be everything wc want..."

AsMaude put it, "lfyou want to sing out,
sing out. And ifyou want to be free, be frte'z
just the kind ofmood you need for ﬁnals!

Pi is by far the best new movie 1 saw this
year. 1 evcn saw it twice this summer: first in
Toronto (where, strangcly enough, it was
shown before the official us release date) and
then once again in my favorite theater in New
Yorki interestingly, I happen to know the per-
son who was the likely inspiration for Max
Cohen. He also workcd with Aronofsky (the
director) on mathematical aspects of the
script. (Cohen and Aronofsky were room.
mates thcir freshman year at Harvard.) But

 

 

Up Acting students to

present final scenes

BY SARAH J. LIEBMAN
Staff Writer

The Fundamentals of Acting Class will
perform a final presentation of scenes and open
itself to the observation of the student body
today.

The class will present a broad range ofcon—
temporary pieces. Some students will perform
monologues of their own choosing. The rest
will perform scenes. The scenes concern hu-
man relarionships and communication in a
wide misty ofsituations.

The open class time will be divided into
the same three parts as a daily class. The class
begins with ‘vocal and physical warm-ups fol-
lowed by improvisation and scenework. Pros
fessor Heather May emphasized that the course
is about learning and “process" rather than
“product," even thought it does culminate in
this performanceThe scenes can be consid-
ered works in progress, Because of the size of
the class there wasn’t sufﬁcient rehearsal time.

May has enjoyed watching students with a
wide variety of levels of experience grow and
learn from one another. Somestudents are con»
sidering careers in theatrc, others have no_e>te
periencc, and some are interested in the redr-
nical aspects of theatre but take the class to
understand actors. The beginning students
learn from those with more experience and the
more experienced actors beneﬁt from the fresh
perspective of the other students.

"instead of just being in it class with the.
atrc people seeing what I had done, I had the
chance to get input from people who arc par
tential theatre majors and people who just
wanted to take a class in acting for fun,“ said
Tom Robson ‘02.

"The class has a terrific scnsc ofenscmblt,"
said May, who felt that her class was a come
fortable and energizing place for sludcntswho
become active participants. she said that the
students built a collaborative environment
through critiquing one anotltcr’s performances.

The students also prepared for scencwork
by writing script and character analyses. "I’ve
learned that the really tedious work that is is
signed before work on a scene bcgins is really
quite helpful . Something as seemingly simple
as that can mean the difference between a suc-
cessful scene and an unsuccessful one. I’ve also
learned the importance of subtext, and that
what a character says is very frequently not
what they mean. Ercrcises in thinking and
speaking subtext havc helped add to the
scenework that I've done,“ said Robson.

Robson encouraged students to think of

the class as something that was open to all stii.

dents, not just rhcatro majors. ”People who
never thought of themselves as actors pro-
gressed and really started to develop over the
course ofthe semester," hc said.

 

Student recitals to
showcase musical studies

By MARlsSA THOMPSON
Staff Writer

For what may 5 the culminating event of
many students' music lessons, two recitals will
showcase musical accomplishment today at
4:15 pm. One recitalwill be in EincArts 103,
and the other will be in Herrick Chapel.

The Fine Arts recital will feature many inv
dividual vocal performances and a single ine
strumental performance. Duane Gugcl, De-
partment of Music Accompanist, will accom»
pany all of them on piano. Sopranos Ann
Newman ‘99, Gwynne Kizet ‘01. Margaret
Higginson ‘01,andAnne Kosscff‘OZ; baritones
Zeb-Michael Curtin ‘01 and Tim Kerber ‘02;
alto Katherine Herold ‘01; tcnor Benjamin
Blehm ‘02; and bass Martin zwikel ‘00, will
each give individual performances. Addition-
ally, Esther Rosenow ‘02, will play the ﬂute.

"'1 think recitals are more fun to watch than

really, he's not that weird. Actually, he's a
friendly guy who, besides doing math, enjoys
writing short stories, and already has published
some. ,
The best thing about Pi is how truly
original and refreshing it is. It's not just an—
other pseudoindependsnt movie about some
cute guy who does math (I hated—and i hardly
ever use that word, but i really did hem mind
Will Hunting). The main character, Max
Cohen is a paranoid and tormented genius who
lives alone in a tiny Chinatown apartment with
his "pet" Euclid, a "homemade" computer.
One ofmy favorite parts iswhcn he, in voice.
over. tells how he once stared at the sun as a
child . because he was told not to. When his
eyesight returned, it brought him supernatu-
ral arithmetic faculties, along with wrenching,
nose-bloodying migraines.

Back to the story Max believes that there
is a hidden pattern to everything in the world,
hence everything can be understood through
mathematics, from fluctuations of the stock
market to the true name ofGod. Thus the re-
clusive mathematician finds himselfsimulra-
neously being courted and pressured by two
different groups: some friendly but ruthless
Wall Street business types, and also some
friendly but ruthless Orthodox Hasidic Jews.
Pi has that nice grainy indy sort of look; it
was shot entirely in high-contrast black and
white with almost no gradation of grays in
between, which makes for some nightmarish,
Kafkaesnue visuals. Dizzying camera and fran-
tic, rapid editing give it a roller—coaster ride
feeling, and the overall emotional intensity is
reinforced by the excellent electronica
soundtrack. The movie was made for only
$60,000 (plus deferred salaries), and l admire
Aronofsky's ottraordinrry talent for turningfi-
nancial limitation into artistic inventiveness. I
can't wait to see what he does next.

The bottom line: go see this onc, I
promise you‘ll like it, if you‘re interested in
any of these: mathematics, religion, techno
music, stock market, board games, New York-
crs, philosophy, or unconventional ﬁlmmak—

Williams will play songs from album,

Car Wheels on a Gravel Road

By EMILY LARSON
StaffWriter -

“You know that frustration when you to»
member, finally, what your lover's neck smelled
like, how long you had to wait in the car for
Dad that one time, how much it hurt when
your first friend died, but you can't describe it
to anyone, not in a language they would un-
detstand? Lucinda can, in high res country:
rock songs as simple and inevitable as the rain
falling on your car roof in a fcw ycars, you’ll
have to replacc the car, You’ll never ﬁnd an
other Lucinda.”

so wrote Sasha Frcrc-JonesofSI’IN maga-
zrne, who rcccrirly named Lucinda Williams
new album, ctr Wicca in a cvarezloatl, one
ofthc best albums of 1998.

Lucinda Williams performs this Saturday
in Harris at 9 pm. Doors open at a pm, and
tickets are required

“I am expecting it to bc the best concert
ever from Lucinda," said fan Emma Drake ‘02.
”My mom saw her in Knoaville a couple of
months ago and said she does a wonderful cone

Williams’ music is not easily classiﬁed. “I
guess 1 was most imprcsscd with the way she
transcended musical genres," said SGA Con»
certs Committee chairperson Andrew

Etrenhofer ‘00. “Sure. she was country and
blues and rock and folk, but her music has a
way ofevading those conventional labels...lt’s
just well—crafted music."

Williams’ career as a singer/songwriter has
spanned twenty years and her songs have been
covered by such performers as EmmyLou Har-
ris and Tom Party. In 1994, Mary Chapin»
Carpenter's rendition of Williams “Passion-
atc Kisses" earned two crammys. Car thrlr
is Williams ﬁrst new album in Six years. Ac
cording to Dave Rosen ofrn/t Blot Magazine,
"Car Witt/r has been well worth the wait, as
she unleashes her most powerful record to a
public too long in their ignorance other pro»
digious talents."

Ettenhofcr anticipates that Grinnell will
enjoy the show. ”Because she crossed the
boundaries ofsevcral diffcrcnr types ofmusi-
cal genres, I thought that dihercnr types ofmur
sical fans could appreciate her music. in other
words, I thought a lot ofpcoplc on this cam.
pus would dighcr music,,.crinnell has a good
relationship with her agchy; we bookedTracy
Chapman with [them] and the tour routing
worked. So Grinnell is blessed to have Lucinda
Williams come and play for us."
