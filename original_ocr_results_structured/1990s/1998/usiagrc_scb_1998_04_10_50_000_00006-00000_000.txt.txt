charge and managed two more runs
in the closing innings to secure tlte

“I was extremely happy with this
win because we played great base
hall," commented Coach Tim
Hollibaugh. “We maintained a con-
sistent attack
while exhibit»
ing a strong
defensive pres-
ence with no
errors the en.
tire game. This
was an overall
good perfor—
manee."

J a c o b
Chavez, Dan
Corsetti and Michael Munoz all con»
tributed with excellent pitching per»
formances. Corsetti ended with the
win and Munoz captured the save.

In the second game the Mustangs
proved too much to handle.

Mount Mercy racked up three
mnsin the firstinning to takeaquick
lead, then the Pioneers answered
right back. compiling an impressive
five runs and hitting all the way
through the lineup. However. this
was all the ﬁrepower the sluggers
could to muster, bested by the con-
sistent pitching and defense of the
Mustangs, who produced four more
runs for the 775 win.

“I think We became a little over-
confident after taking the early lea ,"
remarked Hollibaugh. “We jumped
out right off the hat, but did not stay
hungry. We also had three errors and
had trouble with their good pitching.
However, it was a pleasing day over-
all and I am sure that we will con-
tinue to improve."

Joel Cladouhos went the distance
on the mound, pitching all seven in-
nings and exhibiting great poise and
leadership throughout the second
game, The offensive performance by
Chavez was also impressive as he
accumulated three hits and three stOv
len bases. Hollibaugh also lauded
Munoz for his defensive work that
included an outstanding diving grab
in the second game.

“I just want us to keep our focus
and keep the intensity up. If we do
that, I am sure that good things will
come and we will get better." con-
cluded Hollibaugh.

Golfers finish 13th
in first tourney

Sports Information

In a tweeday golfing event hosted
by William Penn, Grinnell managed
to ﬁnish 13m out of 14 teams. Mt.
Mercy won the meet with 625 and
Central was second at 631. The
Grinnelltans totaled 715, just nine
strokes behind Macalester.

“Our goal is to shoot two rounds
under 340 this week," explained
Grinnell College men‘s golf coach
Greg Wallace. The Pioneers play at
Wartburg on Friday and Saturday,
facing many of the same teams they
encountered last weekend. ‘

1‘For us to shoot around 340 we
need to have Raj Sahu shoot in the
70’s and three other players stay in
the 80’s." noted Wallace. “We have
a young team which needs more ex-
perience. With a few more meets and
practice we should see the scores
come down."

Sahu led the Pioneers with rounds
of 85 and 82 for a 167. Wallace
thinks his top man, who finished
third at the Midwest Conference
meet last spring, is about to make a
breakthrough. “Raj shot a respectv
able 82 even though he isn‘t really
on his game yet. Ithink he’ll break
out sometime in the next few weeks
and shoot a really good round," said
the coach.

Rookie Ben Skalland carded a 177
with rounds of 88 and 89. His classr
mate, Brandon Martinez, fired a
teamalow 82 on Friday but struggled
to a 99 on Saturday. “These two men
could have solid games but they
don't hit the ball long," offered

Wallace. “On windy days on wet
courses they are going to have
trouble. As we get deeper into the
spring and the weather gets better,
they should improve signiﬁcantly."

On Friday Matt Roberts‘ round of
94 was used in the team’s scoring and
on Saturday Robby Lane's total of
96 counted in the squad total. Rob~
erts shot a 105 on Saturday for a 195
while Lane had a 95 on Friday for a
191 total.

“We have not found any consis-
tency yet. We are young and little
things are affecting our play. More
than anything, we need some prac-
tice time to hit balls," concluded

Sports Information

The'98 netmen are one of the
most talented Pioneer tennis teams
ever; however, with no seniors and
only twojuniors in the top group, the
team is young and inexperienced. As
the team's most important match so
far this year approached, it was unr
clear whether the pressure would
keep the Pioneers irorn playing their
best tennis.

On Friday, the netmen layed any
such doubts to rest. With veteran-
like poise and control, they downed
Knox, 5—2. Taking on defending
Iowa Conference champions Luther
a day after the emotional win. the
Pioneers' mental game appeared a bit
frayed. Luther swept Grinnell, 7-0.

Said Coach Andy Hamilton:
“What makes me so happy about the
win over Knox is that we played the
match with a great calm and cool
demeanor. For young players to go
into a match and conduct themselves
that way is very impressive. Unfor»
tunately, we weren‘t able to maintain
that concentration in the Luther
match."

Against Knox every Grinnellian
helped win at least one point. After
dropping the ﬁrst set 1-6. to a player
who last year ﬁnished in the top four
in the Midwest Conference, Spenser
Piston fought off match point to win
the second set. 7-6 (9-7),- Piston,

lied mentally and physically to take

In one of the rare Friday meets,
the Grinnell College men’s track
team is slated to compete at Central
this week. “I hope we can get a lot
of the team to the meet," noted Coach
Will Freeman. “We may have some
trouble. though, because some of the
athletes may not be able to miss
class.“

Freeman explained that‘the Cen-
tral invite is typically a medium-
sized ﬁeld. "There may be a few
teams which don‘t participate this
spring because the meet is on Fri—
day."

Last weekend the Pioneers were
extremely shorthanded because all
but one ofthe sprintcrew did not ate
tend the Luther Invitational. Freon
man noted that his team usually runs
well at Luther, which is designed as
it relay meet, but the absence of
sprinters disallowed the formation of
good units.

Three individuals produced per-
forrnances worth noting, according
to Freeman. In his ﬁrst collegiate
outdoor meetjunior Mark Trocinski
threw 44‘ in the shot put and placed
seventh. “If he shows some ime
provement over the next month, he

meet," commented the coach.

Nick Lanna clocked a 57.2 and
Matt Rhoads ivent 57.3 to place
fourth and fifth in the 400 intentio-
diate hurdles.

“Last weekend we had a lot ofatll-
letes who had to stay home to ctther
take the GREs or do other academic
work. That put us at a great disad-
vantage,” concluded Freeman.

It is time for the Grinnell College
women’s track team to shift gears.
Last weekend's meet at Luther em»
phasized the relays. As the Pioneers
prepare for Friday's Central Invita-
tional, the focus thl be oil the tradi-
tional schedule orevents.

At the Norse Relays fresh faces
shined brightly. Records and near
record ﬁnishes were posted by some
of the squad‘s youngcst members.
Coach Evelyn Freeman commented,
”The outstanding performance ofthe
meet came from sophomore
Caitlarin Bailey, whose split of59.9
was the fastest in the 4x400."

Firstrycar Idelle Cooper set a
school record in the pole vault with
a sevcnrfoot jump, good for a fifth-

Heard, Walters, Seraﬁni, and Walker
ﬁnished the sprint medley in 4:23.92,
good enough for third place.

”It 18 exciting to see how well our

Dekock at No. 6 also picked up
singles victories. Michael Chang’s
unbeaten streak was snapped as he
lost at No, 3 singles and Aaron
Wagner was downed at No. 4. Both
Chang and Wagner, however, won in
doubles. Chang teamed with
Pourciau to win at No. 2 and Wagner
joined Solmose for a victory at No.
3.

On Saturday Grinnell hosted
Luther, the best opponent the club
will face this season. The Pioneers
failed to win a single match but. de-
spite the scores Hamilton cited
Solmose and Wagner for their com/
petitive play.

Hamilton admits that the Pio—
neers‘ “concentration broke down
against Luther." “We still are look
ing for our ﬁrst point against them,"
continued Hamilton. “Luther has
had a very solid program for years.
They are very well coached and are
a very classy club on the court. I
aspire for our program to go the way
theirs has.“

The Pioneers, 773 on the year, will
travel to Wartburg on Wednesday.
The Pioneers have already beaten
Wartburg this season. Grinnell will
then face host Coe and Augustana on
Saturday.

"I’m looking for a little more con-
sistent control of the mental game.
There is no question that this team is
very talented in terms of tennis skills.
With improved concentration we will
be very hard to beat.” said Hamilton.

Grinnell held off a brief rally by
Marycrest to win, 5—3. Junior Erin

ror by scoring the go-ahead run. The
remainder of the game was an exhi—
bition of defensive skills as no addi-
tional runs were scored. The win was
the first for junior pitcher Sarah
Banola.
