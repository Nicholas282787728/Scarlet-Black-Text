1 § The Week:

‘-'[1 was] born January 26,1978 on
the day that Michigan was brought
into Ll1: union,“ said Erin Marie \Vil-
liams, ‘00.

I must admit, this confused me at
ﬁrst, but after reading my cnrire in»
terview, via EVAX, with Williams, it
became abundantly clear that she
wasone ofthe most "together“ people
I had ever met. The word that comes
to mind: confidence.

"This is me only college that I ap-
plied to, partially because Iwas lazy at
the time and because prep school
drained the life out ofme and made
me hate the entire college search pro-
cess," explained \thliams. “I realize
rhar just being here makes me a very
lucky, privleged kid with more oppot.
tunities than most out there.“

Wlliams is particularly impressed
with the opportunites that Grinnell
offers, saying. "I love it here because
we’re encouraged, even expected to
take advantage ofevcryrhing Grinnell
has to offer, which I think is a lot!

Everyone is involved on campus, I
don’t have a single friend that isn’t in-
volved in various organziarions, the.
atre, dance, etc."

she, herself, is quite an active
member of the Grinnell community,
and perhaps also a very inﬂuential one.

She is the student advisor/spokes-
person for DivCo, the Academic Ad»
visor for Concerned Black Students
(CBS), and a volunteer in the Peer
Assistant Program.

"We’ve been on top of things, re—
sponding to immediate problems and
looking to the future and long term
issues. We wanted to branch out and
address issues such as body image, and
disabilities, but the events of this
semsester changed our focus a bit. We
decided to harness thelencrgy that was
already here,” said Williams about
DivCo.

Aside from these activites, Will»
iams works an average of 15 hours at
the admissions ofﬁce, a job she enjoys,
in part because of the readily avaliable
food.

"...rherc are always so many rumors
going around about the system and the
evil administrators, its so good to sort
ofbe on the inside and see things

for myself lhave first hand knowl-
edge that no one in there is evil, diey

are all working to make the school
better. People say that each fresh-
manclass ismorc preppyastime goes
by and that they’re recruiting a dif.
ferrnt rype orsrudent now. and this
possibility scares people. But ITS
NOT TRUE! [llcr capsl."

After reading all other acrivircs,
my questions about other hobbies
seemed a bit ridculous, but she re.
sponded nonetheless.

"I used to run, and used to play
the piano am slowly getting back
into that)...I make quilts, is that
good.>

Actually, I’m really proud ofone
that i made for a person that I used
to know very well. I made it for his
birthday because his grandmother
makes quilts, and i told him that I
wanted to try,

HE said that I wouldn’t be ablc
to do it, so I took on the challenge
(everything is a competition for me)
and made a really nice one with i
DID IT! embroidered on the bot-
tom,“ said Williams.

Her competitive drive is appar
ent when she discusses her future
plans, which include raking a year
off, maybe applying for "a Watson
otsomcthing." After that, Williams
secs herselfattcnding law school.

"...hoperully NYU or Colombia
or Michigan (...the last is a place that

my older brother applied and didn’t get
into, so l'd LOVE to get in there and
just turn them down. We’re all about
competing with one another, not very
nice, really)."

Her goals, however, are just as so-
cially conscious as her present positions.

"1 would like to go into Civil Rights
Law, hopefully working for the South»
ctn Poverty Law Center, They are just
the most amazing organziation. Have
you heard olean Watch?

They've banicrupted the Klan more
thanoncc, pretty good. But they are
more than that, they help people out as
well,“ said Williams.

"Anyway, there are so many things
that I think need to change and I want
to get involved and change them!"

Williams seems to be the living ad-
vcrsary to sloths everywhere, and be.
cause other trcmenedaus ambition and
obvious drive for excellence, there seems
to be no room to doubt her complete
success.

But, iusr as no great leader can sur»
vive alone, she asked ifI minded includ—
ing a "big THANKS!" to sally Graver,
AnncPczalla, and Kavira coulagi.

The selection and approval process
for proposed uses oirhe Fund For Ex.
cellcncc is nearly complete. By far, the
most hotly debated proposal is the
plan to implement a mandatory 5e»
mot—year project in all majors, This
project would be a “finishing off" step,
m the same way that the ﬁrst-year ru-
torial is the mandatory introductory
requirement ofa Grinnell education.
On Monday, Dec. 15, President
Russell K. Osgood will release his fin
nal position paper on the EFF. pro-
posals, including the senior-year
project proposal.

Known as the “capstone Bperi-
ence," the proposal would entail the
most significant change in academic
curriculum ofany FFE proposal. Bout
students and faculty ofGrtnnell Cole
loge have shown keen interest in the
matter. In a recent interview, President
Osgood said that the capstone Expe-
rience came about as a result of read—
ing die fund proposals, as well as [alke
ing to both students, alumni, and fac-
ulty. The Capstone Experience would
integrate elements of other proposals,
such as the interdisciplinary seminar
proposal. A plan similar to the
Capstone Experience was debated and
essentially approved by the faculty ten
years ago, but which failed, according
to Osgood's draft statement, “in part
because of cost and administrability
concerns."

Additional input came from stu-
dents, both current and former. Said
Osgood, “A lot of (Grinnell alumni)
said that the best thing diey did was a
senior project, or senior paper. About
twenty students and former students
mm: up to me and told me this. That’s
a signiﬁcant number.” Osgood noted
that many ctinncll students already

participate in a sort of“ﬁnishing off"
project during their senior year, either
through an independent project or as
a mandatory part of their major. He
mentioned the Gender and Women’s
Studies department, which has a see
nior project requirement for its ma-
lots.

As the proposal stands now, the
capstone Experience, if approved.
would undergo an experimental phase,
in which perhaps six or seven formats
would be tried. The project would be
run on a completely voluntary basis,
in which seniors already doing final
projects would participate. Although
the timeline for the experimental phase
was initially set at two years, Osgood
now feels that the process would take
“closer to five years.” Said Osgood, ”I
don‘t think we would be able to learn
everything that we would need to learn
in two years." if the Capstone plan
proceeds, the class of2000 would be
the first to participate in the experi-
mental phase.

studenrs and faculty and have
mixed views ofthe proposal. Almough
many students like the idea as an op»
rion, most students are opposed to a
Capstone Experience as a mandatory
part ofthe curriculum.

Bryan Dunham '00 echoed these
sentiments. “I don’t have a total opin»
ion on (the Capstone Experience),"
said Dunham, “but I don’t think it
should be mandatory.

According to Osgood, “The faculty
say something slightly different. They
say they like the idea ofa Capstone,
but it should be ‘heavy duty.” Al—
though mcy are generally in favor ofa
rigorous final project, most do not
want it mandatory. However, noted
Osgood, “there is a substantial num-
ber of faculty" who would support a
mandatory Capstone.

Another concern of many students

is the possible “modest increase in the
size ofTutorial cl asscs" and “reduction
ofthe overall size ofthe mid-level cur-
riculum,” as noted in the draft report.
These consequences could possibly
arise due to the increased burden
placed on faculty. Most students are
particularly opposed to the reduction
ofmidelevel (ZOO-level) courses, When
questioned about these issues, Osgood
said, “You have to be honest (about the
possible impacts), but for the period
of the experiment, I see no curricular
impact." Osgood stressed that there are
still “a whole lot of questions” still
unresolved.

There is also the “Swarthmore” is-
sue. in his draft report, Osgood wrote
"Swarthmore, for example, hassuch a
requirement.” Many students rook Lhis
as an indication that Grinnell, as a col-
lege was attempting to “be like
Swarthmore."

Along with Grinnell’s much pube
licized rise in ranking in (/5th 6‘
World wart, some students felt that
the Capstone Experience was evidence
of Grinnell’s attempt at copying the
higher tanked school. In response,
Osgood said that he mentioned
swatmmore merely as an example of
an institution already implementing a
similar program. “I don't thinkwe need
to be like Swarthmore.‘

Some students felt that they're
classmates were blowing the
swarthmore issue out of proportion.

Matt Blankenship ’01 said that, al-
though opposed to the reduction of
mid-level classes, he felt people
“shouldn't oppose the Capstone just
because Swarrhmorc does it."

After the release of the final posit
tion paper, the next step in the process
will be formulating the various possible
formats for the program. “I drink the
classic senior essay is just one possibil»
ity,” said Osgood.

Other ideas include a seminar
based program, with each seminar
taught by three professors, one from
each division.

Another idea conceives each senior
being mentored oneeon-one by faculty
in the completion ofan advanced
project.

No one is certain of the outcome
ofthe Capstone proposal. Ir may turn
out to be one of the most important
consequences to come out ofthe Fund
For Excellence.

Indeed, there might not be discus.
sion of die capstone Experience were
it not for the FFE. Said Osgood, in»
terest in the idea “was always under the
surface. I think the FFE gives us the
funds to run the experiment.’ We may
have to wait five years to see the tee
suits of the experiment.
