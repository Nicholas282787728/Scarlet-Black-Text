The power of a Grandpa

Children have a very special
relationship with Grandma and
Grandpa. That’s why grandparents
can be such powerful allies in
helping keep a kid off drugs.

Grandparents are cool.
Relaxed, They’re not on the ﬁring
line every day. Some days a kid
hates his folks. He never hates his
grandparents. Grandparents ask
direct, point—blank, embarrassing
questions you’re too nervous to ask:

“Who’s the girl?”

“How come you’re doing
poorly in history.” ‘

“Why are your eyes always
red?”

“Did you go to the doctor?
What did he say?”

The same kid who cons his
parents is ashamed to lie to
Grandpa.Without betraying their
trust, a loving, understanding
grandparent can discuss the dan—
ger of drugs openly with the child
he adores. And should.

0 The average age of ﬁrst—time

 

 

 

 

 

 

«see

drug use among teens is 15.
Some kids start at 9.

0 1 out of 5 American kids
between 9 and 12 is offered illegal
drugs. 30% of these kids receive the
offer from a friend. And 12% named
a family member as their source.

' Illegal drugs are a direct link to
increased Violence in many com-
munities, to AIDS, to birth defects,
drug—related crime, homelessness.

As a grandparent, you hold a
special place in the hearts and
minds of yOLIr grandchildren.
Share your knowledge, your love,
your faith in them. Use your power
as an inﬂuencer to steer your
grandchildren away from drugs.

If you don’t have the words,
we do. We’ll send you information
on how to talk to your grandkids
about drugs. Just ask for your free
copy of “A Parent’s Guide to .
Prevention,” Call 1—800—624—0100.

Grandma, Grandpa. Talk to
your grandkids. You don’t realize
the power you have to save them.
