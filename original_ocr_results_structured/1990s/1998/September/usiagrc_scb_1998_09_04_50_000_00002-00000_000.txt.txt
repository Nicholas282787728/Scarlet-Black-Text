champion, '-

The hated Knox is favored to win the
championship, but rhe Pioneers expect ro do
well as a team, and exceptionally at the indi—
vidual level.

pirsr:year sarah Evans, from Denver,
“wasn’t very excited about Lhe golf season” upon
her entrance to Grinncll. “After I get here,"
she explained, “I was pleasanrly surprised ro
find that Coach Faitchild had recruited another
freshman with past tournament experience.”
Thar ﬁrstcycnr is Hillary Minnick, whose low
scores have lead the team to date. Recruited
by Division 1 schools, Fairchild claims Minnick
could be the conference champion as a fresh-
man. and Jones was equally excited. “I think
that Hilary and I should do well this season.
and hopefully will be able ro qualify for me
NCAA ehampionships."

Fairehild is quick to note however. that this
is not just a nvorpcrson team: Her two te-
turnmg players from last year, junior Sarah
Miller and sophomore Sarah l’ohlman, borh
have ionrnamenr experience, as does senior
Jessica Dvorak, a member ofthe 1996 squad.
“l expect rhis rrio ro conrinue ro improve and
lower their scores,” said Fairehild. “We are in
better shape than we ever have been as a team.”
