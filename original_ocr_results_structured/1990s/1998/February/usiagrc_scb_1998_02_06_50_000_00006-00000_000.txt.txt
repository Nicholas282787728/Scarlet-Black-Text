Road woes hit

BY SETH KLEIMAN
Sports Information

The Grinrtcll College women’s
basketball learn struggled again on
the road last week, dropping two
more contests to Midwest Confer-
ence rivals Knox, 59-54, and 111i-
ttois College, 63-45. The squad,
which has conic up just short on
several recent oceasrons, is re:
maining positive and will try again
this week to overcome two tough
opponents. ’I‘he hoopslers host
Lake Forest this Friday a16:00 arid
St. Norbert on Saturday at l:00.

Against Knox the Pioneers
mine out aggressively and started
off the game exceptionally well,
according to Coach Jenny Wood.

“We began very strong and con-
tinued to execute well throughout
the half, thus ending the period in
pretty good siiapensaidWood. "I
was happy with both our offense
and defense and felt that we were
on track,"

Tied 29-29 to begin the second
period, it did not take long for the
Pioneers to get derailed. The Prai-
ric Fire were tenacious under the
boards and pulled down numerous
offensive rebounds, which trans-
tilted into scoring O])p0r|unllies..
Although the battle remarnetl tight
throughout, the cagers were unable
to smother the Fire's attack and
fell in another close match

"It is a challenge to hold a lead
and extend it This has been a nag-
ging problem for us," commented
Wood. “We do not have any roorti
for error and we need to be hitting
orl all cylinders for 40 minutes.
This game was pretty upsetting

because there were things that we
could have controlled to win. but
we did not get them done."

Carrie Brownell '01 led the
scoring. huckeiing 19 points and
grabbing 7 boards. while Amy
Wallets ’0] knocked down 17. Liz
Graf ’01 led in rebounding with 8,

Versus Illinois College the Pio-
neers started off impressively
again, controlling the tempo and
flow of the game,

"We really had an offensive
rhythm going in the first half and
a feel for the game was definitely
evident," Wood remarked. "l was
pleased With our execution and
hoped that we could continue this
style of play. Unfortunately, this
was not the case."

As the second period began, the
Lady Blues took charge and capi-
talized on missed shots and turn-
overs by the Proneers. Outscoring
the cagers 38-17 in the half. I.C,
dissolved any hope for the Pio-
neers,

Graf led with 16 points arid 10
rebounds while Sacha Steenhoek
’00 pulled dowti ll boards.

"Once again, we were very (lISA
appointed with the outcome,"
stated Wood. “We have been
struggling ever since we endured
some key injuries, but we will con-
trnue to keep fighting and remain
competitive Now we have to gear-
up for two challenging opponents.
Both Lake Forest and St. Norbert
are strong and pressure the ball te~
nacrously, so this is what we will
focus on in practice this week," she
concluded.

The coach pointed to a quartet of
distance swimmers who swam well
and scored. In the 1000 free Aitl on
Severn '00 was fourth, Chris
Werniinont ‘98 swam sixth, Jeremy
Luttdtitiist ’99 ﬁnished seventh and
Ian Bessc ’00 was eighth, That' group
also did well in the 500 free and
Besse set a season—best time.

Brian McElroy ’00 continues to
improve in the butterlly. l-le clocked
season-best tilnes in the 200 fly for

third place and the 100 fly for fourth
place. Coach Hurley also noted that
four brcaststrokcrs, Zeb Curtin '01,
Greg Peterson ’98, Mike DeWaay
’98 and Matt Tsclretter ‘01. all
dropped their times

"We have less than three weeks
until our biggest meet ofthe year, the
Midwest Conference champion-
ships. Some ofour athletes will start
their taper this week, Things are
coming together very nicely for this
group." concluded the coach

“The meet agarnstLoras Will give
us a chance to try some different
things and give the swimmers a little
variety," said Coach Erin Hurley. “It
is the last meet for those not going
to conference and we expect great
times from those swimmers. With
conference two weeks after the meet,
it will also be important for us to fi-
nalize race strategy. We must main-
tain our mental toughness at a time
in the season when our athletes can
fall into an up and down cycle."

Last weekend amid a rowdy
crowd at Obertnlller Pool in the

Jo Schaalman ’99, who has 211-

scores and is favored at conference,
placed first in both diving events.

“Although Jo continues to win,

-she is not diving at her full potential.
Ifshc hones her skills for conference
and dives her best there, she could
win by a huge margin," said Coach
Hurley.

The success of the Mad Ducks at
home has sparked an influx of fans——
some of them raucous and, in Scot-
tish garb#at the meets. At one point
these rowdy fans. while adding to the
swimmers' home-pool advantage,
held up the meet because of their
excessive noise.

“Those fans are great," com-
merited l-lurley on the gang ofscant-
ily clad Scotsmen in attendance, “but
lyust wish they could cheer in spurts
for the beneﬁt ofthe timers. No one
really knows who they are or what
they represent. but they certainly
riled people up." .

The Mad Ducks look forward to
their dual-meet with Loras on Satur-
day in their increasingly unique
home pool environment and to pre-
paring for conference.

“After the Loras meal we will start
tapering. We must really rest the
swimmers and keep them healthy to
make the conference meet a success-
ful one," concluded Hurley.

having extra offensive opportunities
due to 31 Knox turnovers, the Pio-

shot only 30%.

“When we are at home we expect
our percentage to go up," said
