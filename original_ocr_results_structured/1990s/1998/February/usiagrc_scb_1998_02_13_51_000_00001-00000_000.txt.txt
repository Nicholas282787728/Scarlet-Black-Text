complicated project but the effort is

~already underway.

Ultimately, the Iowa Department of
Natural Resources (DNR) will decide
what approach to take regarding the
popular recreation area. That, in turn,

For now, though, area residents who
have expressedconcem about the lake‘s
future at least have the assurance that
the process has begun. Two local law-
makers, state Sen. Dennis Black and
Rep. Danny Carroll, have been instru-
mental in conducting public meetings,
contacting the DNR and pushing for
the limnological assessment.

A drive Around the Town reveals
astoundingprogressinthedevelopment
ofthe“new”DavtsElementarySchool.

A new wing, at long low budding,
extends south from the original build»
ing and is joined to it by a bridge
building with really interesting archi-
Icctural lines and windows, a truly
handsome pair,

The actual focus of the combined
buildings appears to be on the bridge
structure which faces east and has the
appearance ofbeingthc eiittancetothe
building. creating ready access toboth
theolderand newerparts,andbringlng
a lot of light into the entire structure.
From the looks of things, the front of
thewholeedificewillfacc BroadStrcct,
rather than Hamilton Avenue, chang-
ing the entire orientation ofthe builda
mg

Perhaps the most eye-catching part
ofthe newer buildings is the way brick
has been used to tie the buildings to-
gether. Brick identical to that in the
older building apparently has been
found ormanufactured tocarry the eye
back and forth between the buildings
to create a harmonious whole. The
effect is quite striking.

lfthe exterior is any indicator ofthe
interior, DaVis may be Grinnell's pre»
mierc elementary school. (And it core
taiiily will be nice to get rid of those
“temporary" classrooms’)

To one who was skeptical originally
aboutwhetherretalninganolderbuildr
ing was fairlo Davis students, all this
is most heartening.

Another transformation is about to
takeplaceAroundtthown,according
tolhe Friends ofStewart Library News-
letter, this one in the interior of the
library.

Sounds as though we may not know
the place!

Extended beyond capacity for space
for its books and other materials, the
library undertook a study by an archir
tectural consultant, The changes from
that study wtll become apparent some~
time in April, says the newsletter.

The circulation desk on the main
floor will be moved to the south ad—
jacent to a small office. West of the
Circulation desk on the south side of
the main floor will be an expanded
reference section,

In place of the present circulation
desk, in the center opposite the en~
trance, will be short stacks of new
books;behindtliatshortstacksoflarge-
print books, then a group of new com-
puter terminals before one reaches the
existing stacks of books.

Onthe north side oftheinain floorof
the library, the west side Will house
current periodicals and back issues.
while the east side wtll hold young
adultbooks,CDsandpapcrbackbooks.

0n the lower level of the library,
four non-bearing walls on the north
will be removed to make room for
officespaceandstorage.An oldcheckv
out desk will become a computer area.
The result of this will be additional
space for different options in planning
activities, the newsletter states.

The renovations also will result in
some new funiishingsiiicludingmuch—
needed new carpeting throughout, it
adds.

Sounds as though Stewart Library
will be all spiffcd up for springiand
many a season thereafter!

“We have posted our study plan and
other data on this site, and Will use it to
keep the public informed as the study
progresses,"heexplaincd,“l haveahouse
on a lake myselfand know how Impor»
tant such studies are to homeowners and
conccmed landowners and citizens."

Selective dredging of the lake has
been suggested as one possibility, is it
a feasible idea at this point?

”Dredging is one of the possible
options, but we cannot know whether
it is a ‘good' option until the study is
done," Downing said.

The study will dctcrminethe sources
of materials and the rate at which silt-
ation is occurring, That should allow
Downing’s teamto make some predic—
tions about how much longer the lake
can survive Without some effective
intervention.

Final report in October 1999

Downing said he hopes to have a
final report completed by October 1999,
then will report on the gamut ofoptions
the DNR has to deal with the problem.
But he stressed that, although his team
will make some recommendations, it
Will be entirely up to the DNR as to
which course of action to take.

Askcdaboutthepractiealityofbrlng~
ing enough ofthe farmland in the war
tershed into more effective conserva»
tion plans, Downing said he won‘t
hazard a guess at this point.

“Again, the feasibility pan of the
study will determincthe practicality .,
r of several options," he said. “lt is
impossible to know whether the [con-
servation] option you suggest will be
practical until we are done."

But Keri Batterson already is work
ing on that part oftheovcrall recb'rdito

lSU graduate in animal ecology, said
in a telephone interview late last week
that she’s now studying the aerial plior
tos. She‘ll then ask landowners to ate
tend a meeting to discuss some specifr
ics regarding what can be done to slow
the Siltation process,

A proactive approach

“I ’m going to work with farmers in
the watershed," she said. “The lSU
study is on the lake, but I‘m trying to
solve some ofthe problem before the
sediment actually gets to the lake —
before the actual restoration effort."

That, of course, will take some
money, and Batterson is in the process

“The focus will be on those who

Batterson is seeking letters of sup

can come from local officials or prir

would be welcome as well, she added.

Rockareek designation
should spur rehab work

News that the Iowa Department of Natural Resources has decided to place
Rock Creek Lake on the Public Owncd Lakes List is encouraging. As we
reported Monday, the newly hired watershed coordinator is hard at work, and
a scientiﬁc team is launching a study that should lead to some speciﬁc
recommendations regarding rehabilitation ofthe silt-clogged lake,

The DNR designation is important because it gets to the very root ofthe
problem: soil Cl‘OSlOn on the 25,000-acrc watershed. According to DNR
Director Larry Wilson, the move means that there will be an increase in the
amount ofinoney the slate Will pay toward the establishment of conservation
practices on the land surrounding the lake. Until now, that funding was
available to landowners on a 50-50 basts. The Jasper County Soil and Water
Conservation District‘s share now increases to 75 percent That means

farmers are much more likely to
sign on to the conservation effort,
building such things as terraces
and grassed waterways to cut
down on erosion and thus reduce
further siltation ofthe lake.

State Sen Dennis Black, whosc
district includes the state park in

Jasper County, called the DNR's dcciston “a major step in the process to
clean up Rock Creek Lake," Indeed it is. But there clearly is a lot ofwork

still to be done.

The scientific study, led by a lininologist from Iowa State University, will
take a year. There’s a great deal of data to be collected before the team of
scientists can offer the DNR the information it needs to craft a speciﬁc plan for
rehabilitation ofthe lake. The head scientist, Dr, John Downing, told us that
it's too early to say whether selective dredging ofthe lake bed will be a viable
option, So little is going to be done to the lake physically for at least li year.

Meanwhile, though, KCI'l Batterson, the \vateishcd improvement COOftlllta'
tor, isn’t waiting for the study to be completed. She said that measures can be
taken now to cut the amount oftopsoil that’s being carried by the lake’s
tributaries, That’s why she's in the process ofstudying aerial photos and
preparing to contact landowners in hopes ofgaining their participation in
better conservation practices. Clearly, the DNR decision will help facilitate

that effort

DNR Director Wilson noted in a letter to Sen. Black that decisions by such
entities as the Jasper County Conservation Board. Jasper County Board of
Supervisors, State Department of Soil Conservation and Natural Resources
Conservation Service to participate financially in the Rock Creek effort were
keys in his department's move to change the lake‘s dCSignation, So, he added,

was the decision to employ Batterson.

All ofthis is encouraging news. Finally, something is being done in earnest
to rehabilitate a recreation area that adds a great deal to the local quality Ofllfc,
