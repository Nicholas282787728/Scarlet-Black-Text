Don’t Ask Me, I’m Just A Girl Letters

BY Ltzz WESTMAN
Campus Cynic

I stopped watching the evening
news when 1 came to Grinnell, pos-
sibly because ofthe 5:30 Simpsons
conﬂict of my first year, though I
can‘t really remember an exact
time. I used to watch CNN and
CSPAN to keep up when I had time,
MTV and Fox news updates when
I wanted a thirty second knowledge
of the world outside of my Own. I
don‘t do that anymore because I
don‘t have cable (donations for me
to get cable are always accepted.
though), I felt guilty for awhile so
I subscribed to the New York Times
World Wide Web site,.but I don’t
really have the time to surf the web
and I usually just end up reading
stuff about pop culture and fashion
anyway. I got a subscription to
Newsweek to keep up with the
times, but it just sits around my
apartment and collects dust and
muddy footprints.

But I have a reason for my isola—
tionist behavior. Iquit. It‘s not la-
ziness. I get angry, very angry.
whenever I watch traditional news
sources. When I watch the nightly
news I see biased viewpoints in
which the real issues are censored
and/or fluffed up by big corporate
sponsors funding that particular net-
work. In facLI prefer to watch tab-

loid jou’rnalism because it doesn‘t ,

hide what itreally is. The 700 Club
doesn't hide its right-wing Christian
agenda like ABC pretends to (ex-
cept for 20/20 which is obviously
propaganda for the dark side funded
b y
Disneypepstblockbusterphillipmorris
and run by Newt Gingrich). The
“liberal media" my asshole. The
“liberal media" is run by big corr
porations and big brother. so, any
way, I see tones and inﬂections of
voices and sound bites in the “unr
blased" newscast, I see the hidden
agenda within these subtleties, an
agenda much different than my
own. I worry that this [htnlyv
masked conservatism becomes in~
ternalized by the nonrthinklng
American public, believed to be
fact, tind acted upon. Hence an ex-

planation for our nation's racist. pro-
war, anti-environment, masochistic
mass culture. Hence, we are going to
a small country to beat them up
(again) so we can pay less money for
gasoline instead oflooking into alter-
native sources of energy like we
should. In fact, if Reagan never out
the majority of the funding the Caner
administration put into research and
implementation of alternative re-
sources, we never would be in this per
sition now. Or in 1991. Of course.
they're not going to show that on ABC
because ABC reztlly stands for DOW,
the chemical (weapons) specialists
who violate more international laws
than Saddam Hussain could even
dream of. At least this time the mass
culture acknowledges to a greater
level that the bullying is for Oil and
notsome thinly-veiled tiioral battle to
save an even smaller country Now.

this because I don't read or see the
news anymore. However, 1 am infi-
nitely happy I am Witnessing the sec-
ond “war” not from a Republican.
suburban, middle school environment,
I also feel comfort in knowing that I
am now in the comfort of knowing
others who were also the only antir
Gulf War students in their respective
elementary, middle, and high schools.
of course, if the trustees have their
way. it won't be this way for much
longer. So, if you ask me how I feel
about the posstble war I can’t tell you
much more than I‘m against it. Idon’t
know all the reasons. but I do know
that there is no excuse for the amount
of inevitable environmental damage
that will occur to save money on a
nonrenewable resource (or to use the
very-thinly-masked moral argument
ofsaving the world from a little coun-
try with biological and chemical
weapons). I‘m sure if I paid attention
I could give you more reasons, but I
don‘t need my blood pressure to rise
for a cause I have little means of pre-
venting.

Another thing that bothers me about
all this is the immense numbers ofthe
American population devoting huge
amounts of energy to this immediate
cause to demonstrate against instead
ofcauses that arejust as relevant that
receive little to no attention at alle spe»
cifically the environmental movement
and the slow and steady removal of
civil rights from our society. As we
creep further into a polluted, police
state, few protest in the numbers I see
and hear about at anti-war demonstra—
tions. Why? Because they don‘t want
you to know about it! They, in case
you are going to ask. isThe Man. Yes.

Fun fact: In modern recorded ltlstory,
the United States has the second high—

To the Grinnell Community,

This is in response to IeffGepncr’s
letter in the previous issue of the
3&8. There are certain points he
made that I agree with, but certain
points which are quite misleading
and uninformed

1) First of all, I agree with Jeff that
there is no evidcncc of the us using
nuclear weapons. You cannot use
“intuition" as proot‘(you need to only
look as far as beginning ofthe Israel-
Arab conﬂict to See how terrible the
consequences can be). At the same
time though, I wonder howjustificd
it is for Jeff to talk about Yeltsin‘s
“drunken outburst}V Where did he
come up with that? Intuition?

2) Just as the reasons for the eco»
nomic embargo are clear, so are the
consequences. Yes, I agree that
Saddam Hussein is not allowing in-
spectors to do theirjob. but are the
deaths of Iraql civilians going to ac-
complish anythlng? The right cause
may have the wrong effect. You can
talk as much as you want about the
right cause. and the principle behind
the embargo, but the reality is, people
are dying.

3) The US is NOT under thejuris-
diction of international law or the
United Nations. The UN has NOT
authorized military force. Ifyou look
up UN resolutions that were passed
(Resolutions 715, 778, 986. 1051.
1115, 1137). none of them authorize
the use of force to make Iraq comr
ply. The US is using resolutions that
authorized the use of force to evict
Iraq from Kuwait, resolutions passed
BEFOREIhe GulfWar. The UN has
NOT passed any resolutions since to
authorize the use of force. In fact,
Bill Clinton, Madeleine Albrtght &
William Cohen have all remarked to
the press that the US in NOT look»
ing for international or UN support
or authorization. All of them have
said that they are willtng to go ahead
with Britain only if necessary. In»
ternational or UN jurisdiction IS not
a concern here (just as it was not a
concern during the bombing ofLibya
m a nonrwar time in an attempt to
kill Gaddafi).

Ido not support Saddam Hussein’s
aggression. But at the same time, I
do not support the US’s aggression
either. US offictals are always talk
ing about how all they want is that
UN resolutions be obeyed by Iraq. I
ask the officials, where was this con
corn for UN resolutions in the cases
of Israel, Turkey, Indonesia and
many other countries? I draw your
attention to UN Security Council
Resolutions 452, 465. 471, 476, 478,
487, & General Assembly Resolution
37, to see some examples of UN

resolutions which used even harsher
language titan those used for Iraq.
And yet, nothing happened in those
cases. Why not? I quote UNSC
Resolution 487: “The United
Nations...strong1y condemns the pre—
meditaied Israeli air attack on Iraqi
nuclear installations it clear vio-
lation of...the norms ofinternational
conduct"; “The United
Natioiis...fully recognizes the in-
alienable sovereign right oftraq, and
all other States, to establish programs
of technological and nuclear devel-
opment"; from UNGA 37: “The
United Nations .. requests AGAIN
[emphasis mine] the Security Counr
ctl to investigate Israel’s nuclear acr
tivities": “.,.requests the Security
Council to consider taking effective
action so as to prevent Israel from
endangering international peace and
security by pursuing its policy of
aggressmti, expansion and annex—
ation of territories." And this isjust
a handful of such resolutions, not
only against Israel, but against other
countries as well. Where was the
concern for international law and
peace then? And where is it NOW
evenl?

The US has to stop its ”international
police ofﬁcer" role. If that role were
played with the support of the inter-
national community, that would have
been okay to some extent, But in this
case, there is complete disregard for
international consensus. ARepubli-
can senator remarked about a month
ago that the US needs to ‘ t ‘em
hard and hit ‘em fast. Just bomb
some of those places and hopefully
also get Saddam at the same time."
Is this some kind of Hollywood ac-
tion movie? I find this “cowboy”
mentality (as Prof. Grey put it) very
frightening. Iam notAmerican. I do
not feel very comfortable with the
idea that the US will be telling us
what kind of leader we should have
in our country. I don't think many

Americans would like it‘cither, if "

roles were reversed.

To conclude, my point is simple.
Even though Saddam Hussein is a
dictator that Iraq would be better off
without, I do notagrcc with the US‘s
stance » no regard for any consen—
sus. no care for any international or
UN jurisdiction. If you look at this
incident by itself, it would be easier
to support the use of force against
Iraq. ButI feel that you cannot do
that . you have to look at the bigger
picture, Maybe you could argue that
Iraq was "bad” and that is why we
have to punish Iraq - but then, what
about other countries which have
done the samc, if not worse? I do
not agree With the US’s partial com
mitment to international peace, turnr

To The Grinnell Student Body—

This Saturday, as I sat waiting in
ARH for the computer labs to open,
I witnessed something that I never
thought I‘d see at Grinnell. A stu-
dent was tearing down the some-
what inﬂammatory ﬂiers regarding
the US involvement in Iraq that
were up around campus Saturday
morning. She was deﬁantly ripping
them off the corkboards and throw—
ing them away.

As I witnessed this I realized that
I had no idea WHY she was doing
this. Was she a supporter of our
involvement in Iraq? Was she of»
fended by the harsh language? Was
she against the use ofﬂiers to voice
political opinions? The point is,
there was no way I could know.
While her act was deﬁant, it was
anonymous and ambiguous. Worst
of all, by tearing down the signs,
she was denying other people the
right to form their own opinions
about what they saw.

I'm not sure what about this incir
dent bothers me more: that she
would do this (and seem pretty con-
tent with herselffor doing it), or that
Ididn’t do anything. Iwatched her
and thought about saying “You
don‘t have the right to do that. It’s
their tight to speak their mind and
other people‘s right to decide for
themselves how they want to react".
But I satthere and steamed instead.
Why was I silent?

I expected more of myself than
that. I also expect more of
Grinnelllans than What I saw on
Saturday. Perhaps the idea of
Grinnell as a haven for those on the
far left is only a myth, but I believed
it when i came here. I thought
Grinnell would be different, and
that there would be hot debates
about political issues. and, in ab
sence of debate. solidarity and vor
calization on campus about issues
such as war. The diversity ofopin-
ions here at Grinnell should only
bring this dream closer to a reality.
I am continually disappointed in
Grinnell‘s student body, and this
woman's reaction to someone else‘s
brave expression of their opinion
about the bombing of Iraq is only

How are you? (Ask this even
though you know. You know this
because they write you pages—long
e-mails daily about exactly how
they feel, what they've done, who
they think is cute, the running sub-
total of how many calories they’ve
consumed for the day, their most
recent crush, etc. Ask anyway,just
to see ifthey catch your sarcasm.)

rm fine (which probably doesn’t
adequately describe how you really
feel but you don’t want to be a
hypocrite and give them every
single last detail of your life like
they do theirs. Plus. it would only
encourage them).

Son'y I haven't written in so long
(even though you're really not.
Guilty, maybe. Sorry, no).

I‘ve been busy (here’s the key,
please choose from one of the fol-
lowing options:

A) lying in a Coma at the local hos-
pital

B)having an affairwithone,orpos-
sibly more. of my professors

C) ignoring your e-mails

D) observing the schizophrenic
weather, confused birds. shaved
squirrels, etc.)

(This bit is crucial. This is the part
of the e-mail where you test them
to see if they actually read your
messages or just interpret them as

the tip of the iceberg.

Grinnellians need to decide what
kind ofa campus this is. Of course I
would prefer if we decided that war is
not a continuation of politics, but even
if we decided that we are behind us-
ing force in Iraq, I would be content
that we had at least made some sort of
a commitment. Neutrality is not an
option. How long are we going to
shrug our shoulders, say that we were
wrong last time we went into the Gulf
(which is now a safely popular opin-
ion to have) but remain undecided
about this time? How many times
does the US foreign policy have to
prove itself selﬁsh and economically
driven before we attempt to prevent
further harm to our enemies? ’

We are not the ones to be ambiguous
about how we feel. We are the ones
that Americans point to as leaders of
the future, the ones who are respon-
sible for our actions as well as our in-
action. We do not have the luxury to
say that someone else can ﬁgure this
one out. If you are behind the US on
this one, fine; if you are against, ﬁne.
I’m with you, But do not remain neur
tral. Do not anonymously rip down
ﬂiers which are attempting to get this
campus riled up, to instigate a debate.
Don‘t plead ignorance, inform your-
self.

More than Grinnellian's opinions are
at stake here. This is not just some
issue where our voices are arbitrary.
This isn't about whether Clinton
sleeps around or not. Ifwe bomb Iraq
then people will die, and the inaction
of the American people is panially
responsible for that, We are not help»
less, we are not out oflhe loop on this
one. What we think does matter. so
let's at least think something. Let the
posters which are shouting at you
reach you and foster a discussion
about something that is crucial. We
do not have the luxury, nordo we even
have the right, to assert an opinion
after the fact. We were wrong to go
to Iraq last time, we are wrong this
time. That's my opinion, and I stand
behind it. I am challenging someone
to come up to me and talk about it—
give'me a chance to persuade you. and
I’ll give you a chance to persuade me.
Let’s talk about this. let’s get angry
and distracted and off the normal
Grinnell subjects (how hard our
classes are). This is more than a his~
tory paper. or a bio test. We are more
than that, and what we think and how
we act are a reﬂection of who we are.
I refuse to be neutral.
