Hundreds march to protest prejudi. o

Hundreds of Grinncll College slu—
dents, faculty and administrators par~
tleipated Thursday inacandlcrlit march
to decry prejudice and hate messages
that shocked the campus ovcrthc past
two weeks.

The college‘s new president, Rus»
sellOsgood,andsomemenibers ofthc
board oftrustecs also took part.

Mickey Munley, the college's in-
terim director ofpublic relations, said
Friday that “well over 400" partici-
pated in the march and the ensuing
speak-out against the anti»Scmitic and
antirhomoscxual grafﬁti that sullied
parts of the campus.

“I wouldn‘t be surprised if there
were 5000r600"pnrticipants, Munlcy
said.

Two-hour event

The event lasted nearly two hours.
During the first hour, people marched
from the Forum across campus, then
moved to the downtown area ofthe
city. Members of the Grinnell Police

Dcpanmciit stopped \vliut Iittlc lirlc-

incidents.

By far the largest contingent iii the
peaceful demonstration was that ofthc
students. At the meeting in the Harris
Center following the march, people
tooktumsatthcmicrophoncstorctlcct
on the reasons for the event,

“Studentsol‘fercdllicirvcry personal
reﬂections," Munley said. “There were
statements that were very positive 7
of community support and coming to-
gcthcr. chcral alluded to not being
able to be very cloquent and being
nervous about speaking. But that was
not the case. People were speaking
about something they believe in very
passionately. Everybody who spokc
was, to apcrson, eloquent and moving
in what they had to say."

campus for a regular meeting and to
attend the Osgood's inauguration Sat-

EYANIDE DEATH —

trace amounts of the gas.

Grimm's double-wrappedbody was
transferred to Des Molnes for a post-
mortem examination, the results of
which were not expected for some
time. Polk County Medical Examiner
Francis Gam‘iy was scheduled to per
form the autopsy on Tuesday.

At the 2 pm. news conference in
Griunell Regional’s Tyson Room,
Cranston said that he had never been
involved in a situation in which potas—
sium cyanide was a factor,

“It’s something you read about in
detective novels," he said.

None of the news conference par
ticipants would speculate about Where
Grimm obtained the cyanide.

Mickey Munley, interim director of
public relations atthe college, described
the mood on campus as “somber." He
noted that this is a week leading up to
mid-semester exams, a time that pro-
duces considerable stress for students
at the rigorous school.

The college immediatelyset upcoun-

seling services for students, faculty
and staff. The counseling was pro-
vided by the student affairs and
chaplain’s ofﬁces and the Poweshiek
County Mental Health Center.

The Orange County Register,ane\v5r
paperthat covers Grimm’s hometown
of Placentia, quoted Fredrick Onlnm,
Carl’s father and a computer systems
specialist, as saying that his son was
frequently frustrated —— despite cam-
ing a National Merit Scholarship at
California's El Domdo High School,

“Carl was good at everything," the
elder Grimm told the Orange County
newspaper. But evérything came
hard to him. He was always feeling
frustration.”

Carl Grimm was a biology major at
Grinnell who was considering a medir
cal career.

“He was never a very joyful per
son," Fredrick Grimm told the news-
paper.“He’d bedownalittle,butnoth-
inglikethis serious. He was wonderr
ful to talk to and was a wonderful son.

“His biggest problem was that he
was impulsive and didn't pursue his
abilities and gifts the way he should
have.”

Russell Osgood, pl'csldcnt ofCrrln—
licll College, issued this ralcmcrrt:
“Everystudenlispiccious to us and,
therefore, this is a very difﬁcult time.
Wc encourage all tiicnibcrsofilieUriii-

Has anyone but Around noticed the
number ofdisoriented drivers in Grim
hell the last three or four days? People
dashing hither and yon distractcdly in
their vehicles looking for an escape
route?

Around can be counted among these
people who attempt to pursue their
regular routes to church, town, library,
grocery store or wherever, only to meet
upwithalarge orange diamond-shaped
sign reading “Road Work Ahead,"
which means backing up, turning
around and ﬁnding a different route to
do the simplest errands.

Fourth Avenue residents have been
undergoing this for several weeks now,
andthe latest drivers arethose who live
north ofSixth Avenue which isblocked
at several intersections to permit road
work.

Thework is anticipated to take about
a week or ten days according to Glen
Baker, Grinnell‘s superintendent of
public works, and then we’ll be free to
pursue our regular routes.

But won't it be wonderful to have
nice smooth new streets?

Speaking of streets, that lop~sidcd
intersection ofThird Avenue and Broad
Street where Third Avenue comes into
the intersection with Broad Street from
Ihe South side of the Iowa Central
Railroad tracks and continues east on
the north side ofthe tracks, has been
undergoing morclhanitsshareofwear
and tear.

Last Friday that intersection helped
host the Motorloway cavalcade as it
paused in Grinnell en route from

Coralvillc to Pclla atthe same time that
Grim-rel] Bcvemge Company was movV
ing from its site on Broad Street to its
new facility in Industrial Parkon High-
way 146.

Thatgoofyintersectionalsoisamain
thoroughfare for cars driving south on
Broad Street to circumnavigate Cenr
tral Park on theirway east to The Depot
Crossing and other destination5vfre-
qucntly at a very high rate ofspced.

It also has an added attraction be-
cause of the new playground equip
ment in Central Park and alterations
underway at the south end ofthc Vet-
erans Memorial Building to permit
varied usage ofthat space.

And, perhaps most importantly, that
intersection is a frequently traveled
route forpedestnans walking from the
Mayﬂower complex to downtown—
sometimes at their peril from fast-
flying vehicles.

A new pedestrian crosswalk mark-
ing is in the works for the intersection
but it behooves all ofus to take a little
care when traversing that route.

A Hawkeye Homecoming

by ANDY WEIDNER
(irll'iilell College ‘99

I ll be the ﬁrst to admit that I had
absolutely no clue as to what Big Ten
foolballwasreally aboutuntilthispast
Saturday, when i spent the grcalcrpart
of my day on the Iowa sideline
\vntcliing.-.,n0, experiencing the
l'lawkcycs 2614 win over the Wild
cats ofNorthwostem.

l had been to Big Ten games before.
As a young boy, my father once took
me to see the Minnesota Gophers play
the Purdue Boilermakers. The game
was cntcrlaining, but definitely not
aulllclltlc Big Ten football. Astroturf,
the Mctrorloinc and a complete lack of
defense (the Gophers won 63-61 on a
last second field goal) have me con.
viiiccd oflhat.

But nonc ofthls prepared me for the
colors. Sounds and smells that born»
bar-tied me this past Saturday in lowa
City. University oflowa football is not
incrcly a game, but a grand spectacle
of niiiareur allilctics.

l was astounded to ﬁnd the streets
surrounding Kinnick Stadium already
awash with Hawkeye fans adorned in
all manner of black and yellow garb
over two hours before the II a.m.
game time, Shortly before the game,
the street was literally teeming with
falls perusing all sorts of Hawkcye
memorabilia for sale: Hawkeye
Cornlicad licadgcar, Hawkcye bumper
stickers and baseball caps, and don’t
forget the everrpopular University of
Iowa cheerleader Barbie, all decked
out in Hawkcyc black and gold.

s_a good thing that my traveling
colnpa'nion and l were connected, be-
cause a day at the game could have put
a serious dent in our pocketbooks. We
palkcd for free in the lawn ofa friend
not three blocks from the stadium, a
spot which normally commands $10
and nets our friend an annual football

Taking the vote
for granted

To the editor:

Many ofus remember the televised
sceitcsrn 1994 wlienthemajority popu-
lation of South Africa voted for the
first time in their lives, Millions stood
for hours in the broiling sun awaiting
their chance to choose their own govv
eminent.

On Nov. 3, we will choose our gov-
crnmcnt‘, but it doesn‘t seem to mean
as much to us. The right to elect our
“rulers” is so well entrenched that all
too frequently we take it for granted,
often even neglecting to vote. This is
tragic!

On Nov. 3, some of us will choose
all ofour state govemment and all but
one of our representatives and senators
in the U.S. Congress. We owe itto each
other-totuni“some“into“many."And,
yes, we owe it to ourselves to vote. —

season income of over $1,000. Most
fans pay 35-7 dollars for parking spots
up to l0blocks fromKinnickStadium.
And it was hard to resist the
mouthwatering aromas driﬂing from
the vendors lined up on Melrose Av-
cnuc,.Pork burgers, fried chicken and
beer, three things that would normally
turn my stomach at nine in the mom-
lng, became strangely appealing in the
festive atmosphere before the game.

Before the game...oh yes, I almost
forgot that we were there to watch a
footbal I game. Aﬁer three orfourpasses
down the main drag, we ambled t0-
wnrd the stadium andthe big game that
lay ahead. But not before a trip It) Ihe
indoor track to watch the marching
band and cheerleaders as they warmed
up. Afterthc mayhem on the streets, I
should not have been surprised by the
spectacle I witnessed inside, but I was
anyway.

The marching band was huge,
enough to ﬁll the ﬂoor of the indoor
track. Their sound was at once over-
powering and stirring. The sizable
crowd in the observation deck and the
bleachers on the floor roared their ap-
proval after each number.

As game time approached, we shim-
rnied our way through the Alumni Band
practicingjust outside the doors ofthe
indoor track. Once inside the stadium,
we were ushered down two ﬂights of
stairs to the photo press room, deep
within the bowels ofKinrlick Stadium.

There we brushed elbows with pho»
tographers from the AP and Des Moines
Register, most with cameras large
enough to keep a small boat at anchor.

The atmosphere was charged with
nervous energy. Many photographers
quietly chatted about last week‘s game
or their newest piece of equipment.
The bounce in their step was notice-
able as they made their way out the
door and down to the ﬁeld. Before we

knew it, we were all alone in the room

watching the players warm up on the
field via closcdrcircuit television.

Once on the ﬁeld, my senses were
overwhelmed. Everything was color,
motion, sound and sunlight. The slde~
line was a dizzying competition for
space. Cheerleaders cllccrcd and
tumbled, the band lined up to march
and a fleet of photographers lllcd to
capture it all on ﬁlm, More than onccl
had to move to avoid being run ovcrby
the l-lawkcyc mascot, Hcl'ky.

Evenmally, the frenetic sitlclinc ac»
tion stopped,bullhccnergylevel in the
stadium kcpt right on going. The fans
in the student section heckled, the
chcerlcaders never stopped cheering
andlhe 70,000+ crowd thundercdthetr
approval as the Hawkeyes stormed their
way to a 17-0 lead midway through the
second quarter.

But something went wrong with the
Iowa machine and Northwestern
clawed their way back into the garlic.
By the end of the third quarter the
Wildcats had closed the gap and tied
the game at 17. Kinnick Stadium was
deathly silent at that point and the
small contingent of Nonhwcstcm fans
at the southeastern comer ofthe field
easily made themselves heard,

But the Iowa faithful did not let their
team roll over and die. Early in the
fourthquarter,withtheWildcalsplnrlcd
on their own goal line, Hawkeyc Ryan
Loﬁin tackled the Northwestern ql.lﬂl'~
terback in the cndzone as he threw lo
an empty spot on the field. linwkcyc
fans screamed for a safety, anti tlicn
roared their approval after the referee
awarded iowa two points for a l9-l7
lead and the eventual winning margin.

Northwestern Coach Gary Bamctl
later said that their quarterback threw
to an empty spot because an ofﬁcial
had bumped into the Wildcat tight end
and he was not able to mn his route
But the real reason that play happened
as it did was the vocal support of the
Hawkeye fans. The noise level during
that series was so loud that I could
barely hear myselfthink. The fans be-
came the lZlh man on the ﬁeld, rattling
theNorthwestemplayers,forcingtheln
to crack under the pressure.

The Hawkeyes held on to win for a
Homecoming victory. Five hours after
the game had started,awcarybutproud
photographer corps made its way back
to the press room. With sweat running
down my forehead and grass stains on
my knees, I downed soda after soda,
listeningtotheprosdiscussthegame‘s
highlights, already looking forward to
next week‘s game at lndiana.

I realized how incredibly drained I
was. My body ached and my mindwas
reeling from the sights and sounds of
the past nine hours. There is no way I
could do this week in and week out, I
thought. It was fun, but once is enough.
I’ll watch it on TV from now on,
