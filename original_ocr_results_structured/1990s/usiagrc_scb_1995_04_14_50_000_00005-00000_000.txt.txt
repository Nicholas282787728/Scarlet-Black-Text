LEVISION, aside from The

a poor inspiration for ﬁlm
Movies based on TV shows can never
overcome the feeling that they are
merely a half hour plot bloated into
ninety minutes With the abundance
of recent ﬁlms derived from Saturday

even worse. trying to stretch a ﬁve
minute Skit into a full-fledged movie.

writers came up with enough funny
stuff to move the actors through a

Boy is one or those movies where,
more often than not. the plotjust gets
in the way. Name a cliché and it’s in
here as a plot device.

This is not to say that the ﬁlm is a

transcends everything that is so
wrong with it.

Most ofthe actors end up looking
lost. Brian Dennehy adds some en-
ergy as Farley’s dad, while Bo Derek
alld Rob Lowe are insipid as the vil-
lains. Every event related to the so
called plot in Tommy Boy feels forced.
The movie, however, is truly funny in
the moments that seem to exist free
from the plot. But why, oh why, did
they have to waste so much time and
money on what would’vernaclea great
ten minute skit on SainrdayNig/iiLive?

Taylor sVicw
HE basic plot of Tommy Boy
goes like this. Adim-witted
I Sort (Chris Farley) returns
home after college, to a cushy job
workin g for his father who manutao
tures auto parts. His father remarries
but dies of at heart attack at the Wed
ding The son sets out on a road trip
attempting to sell his late father's
new line of brake pads so that the
company won’rgo belly up. His mis-
adventures along the way makc for
most ofthe comedy and majority of
the film.

The acting in this film was pretty
poor; there wasn‘ t any original thought
directorally,andamajoi‘lty ofthe jokes
were old by the end ofthe min. i gave
this ﬁlm two stars as opposed to fewer
because i expect less ofa comedy and
because I laughed a few times. (Chris
Farley trying to change his clothes in
an airplane bathroom was particularly
funny.) This is just another SNL rip-
off ﬁlm that was rushed through pres
dueuon and out to theaters. Bottom
line: Probably better save this one
for a late night video rental; it‘ll
seem funnier then.

to try and watch Lllme or four movies
