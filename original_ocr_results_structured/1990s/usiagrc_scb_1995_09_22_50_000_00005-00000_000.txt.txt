At The Movie

House...

Scott’s View

77w Tie That Binds is one of
the worst movies to come out of
Hollywood in a few years. Meant to
be a thriller, the movie’s terrible cinr
ematogtaphy makes dark scenes so
blatant they become laughable. Ex—
cept for the decent performance by
Daryl Hannah, the cast of no—name
actors proves why they are not fa<
mous.

The plot rs unoriginal. Two psy—
chotlcs, Keith Carmdine and Han»
nah, roam the country pillaging rich
houses and killing the familes while
their daughter waits outside in the
car. During one of their robberies,
the police are called and they lose
their child, played by Julia Devin, in
thescuffle. Moira Kelly and Vincent
Spana adopt Devm from a foster
home and the psychotic parents go
on a terror filled rampage to regain
their child.

Director ofphotography Bobby
Bukowski needs to work on his use of
symbolism. The color red is blatanb
ly ﬂashed on the screen throughout
the meme in the hopes of startling
the Viewer. Instead, because of its
very frequent occurrence, it becomes
humorous. One scene which lJESE
characterizes the over use of red is
when Devrn walks through an entry
way and she is baihed in red light
When her foster mother chases after
licr, she is bathed in red light also.
Perhaps lhls is meant lobe e ie, but

is also overdone. When Hannah
attempts to reclaim Devin, she is
completely in shadow while the rest
of the screen is filled with blinding
light. When Hanah reaches out and
touches Devin, darkness creeps over
her as well. Bukowski must learn
subtlety.‘

Child actress Devm is the lone
bright spot in the movie. Her inno—
cent wide eyes and soft Voice portray
the reality of a confused and fright—
ened child well.

Neither Carradine nor Hannah
convince me that they are as blood»
thirsty or deranged as their actions
dictate. There are no snappy one
liners to endear them to moviegoers.
Instead, the director attempts to make
the audience sympathize 7 under»
stand? Hannah‘s fanatical drive to
take back her child. Who knows and
who cares. Carradine’s murderscenes
have none of the power that great
psychotics like John Malkovich, In
the Line ofFl're, bring to the screen.

The foster parents are Stereotylr
ical perfect people who love their
child. They aren’t worth describing
past that.

The Tie That Bind: is a thriller
that just doesn’t thrill.

Eleanor’s View

The Tl'e That Binds is one of
those movies that should have been
more fun that it is. Featuring bad
writing, generallydecentacting, and
plentyofgenericcamemtricks,there
should be enough in here to keep
schlock—thrlllcr fans satisfied. Un<

very little of it is intentional.

Moira Kelly and Vincent Spano
are the attractive and affluent yuppie
couple who adopt Janie, whose real
parents were forced to abandon her
during a bungled robbery. Daryl
Hannah and Keith Canadine play
the white trash parents, with Han»

Art reception for

Cervene

SCOTT ANDERSON
STAFF WRITER

An art reception will be held
Friday the 29th to open an exhibi<
tlon of Richard Cervene’s art in the
Print Room of the Burling Library.

“A reception at Grinnell Col»
lege is done to honor the artist and
present the artist topeople who don’t
know him/her.” Said Print Room
Director Kay Jenkins about why re—
ceptions are held. Everyone is wele
come to attend the reception. Cet—
vene will give a small lecture and
answer questions.

When asked to describe Cer—
vene’s artwork, Jenkins answered;
“He has his own, remarkable style."
Cervene works in color field and
water color.

Last week'the 5&3 printed a r'eviewof thecul _ ,
Funnybones under the'byline “Todd Armstrong," when in
fact the article was taken almost entirely-fromayrevie
Kevin Thomas of the LosA’ngeles Time‘s.I it seems ha a
mistake was made when Mt. Amsrron'g forwarded the article
to the 8&B, and we received the wrong article. We apologiie
for this; we did not mean to give credit where it was not due.

He has received the many awards
for painting ranging from the Grant
Woods Prize in watercolor to 1stplace
awards in oil painting.

Senior member of the Grinnell
College Department of Art faculty,
Cervene has taught atGrlnnell since
1971. “Generations of Grinnell stu—
dents have learned from Cervene,"
said Jenkins.

Other exhibits in the Print Room
are used to supplement classes. A
photo exhibit of New York urban
slums in the late 1800’s by Jacob
Reese will provide images for Profes—
sor Bateman's class studying the See
cial Gospel Movement.

The art history class regularly
studies exhibits in the print room.
Every other year students from the
Grinnell art seminar class choose
paintings from the college collection
for an exhibition. This is an opportu—
nity available at few other colleges.
