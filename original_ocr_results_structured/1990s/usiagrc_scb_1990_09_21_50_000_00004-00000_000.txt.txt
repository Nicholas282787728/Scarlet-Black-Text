students
learn the
Gamelan

By Karin Bellomy

Grinnell's Javanese Gamelan
counts as one of the more unusual
musical groups on campus. Indeed
the ensemble here is one of barely
30 in the United States.

Assistant Professor of Music
Roger Vetter and his wife, Valerie
Mau Veuer. teachlhegamelanclass.
Vellcr describes his field of ethr
nomusicology as "the study of mu-
sic in its cultural context," focus»
sing often on musical traditions
outside the West.

l-le commissioned the making
of a garnelan while in Java studying
the musical life in a sultan's palace
during 1982 and 1983. Although
most gamelans are made from
forged bronze, Vetter opted to have
this one made from less expensive
iron. The entire 25— to 307piece
ensemble of gongs and Xylophone-
like instruments cost less than a
good flute might cost in the United
States.

Indeed. Javanese music differs
from European music in that it does
not use harmony. relying largely on
percussion. Instead a number of
melodic lincsoccur simultaneously.

Students rehearse for the Javenese Gamelan dance concert, scheduled for December.

“It‘s the multi-layered texture
that’s really unique about this
music," emphasizes Vetler. The
music proceeds in cycles, leading
back to the beginning, in contrast
to the linear style of European
music. which has a clearly deﬁned
beginning and end. Without
a conductor to lead them,
players learn to respond to drum
signals. The drum is the“heartbeat"
of the garnelan, telling the players
when to start, when to stop and so
on.

The dancers perform along with
the music of the gamelan. Javanese

 

Something for those
of you who aren’t taking

dance has three main styles. the
strong male, the refined male and
the female. The movements of the
strong male use ahigh, wide space,
with large, extended and energetic
movements, This is to express a
more energetic character. The re-
ﬁned male usesawide space, though
lower to the ground, and thefemale
uses a narrow space. Both of these
are more refined, inward dance
styles.

Unlike Indian dances. in which
each dancer‘s movements tell a
story, and tlle hand movements can
even have word meanings. Java-
nese dancers simplyexpress achar-

added,“lt's a very rich culture in

terms of dances."

Itis not unusual for dances to be
done in dramatic form. telling ex-
tremely old stories. though not all
dances are episodic or dramatic.
Royal court dances are usually en-
tirely abstract, while others are
performed as ritual. A few male
dances even evolved from military
and fighting exercises, Other
dances. often folk or village, are
used to get into a trance.

Participants have found the
gamelan very rewarding. Sopho-
more Sharyn Obsatz said it could
be frustrating to learn. "but when it
finally clicks. it's so satisfying."

The garnelan, with dancers. will
perform at Grinnell in Roberts
Thealer Dec. 13 at 4.30 p.m.

Watches
Soviets'
Mideast
Policy

By Chris Doemel

As the Middle East crisis pro-
gresses, the stance taken by the
Soviet Union in condemning the
Iraqi regime is of particular inter-.
est. At the cutting edge of U.S.
monitoring of the Soviets is the
INR Soviet Foreign Policy Divir
sionoftheStateDepanment,headed
by Wayne Limberg. who was here
last Friday on a recmiting visit.

Limberg’s department. one of
is functional bureaus in the State
Department serving US Intelli-
gence, consists of seven analysts
responsible tor providing data,
analysis and predictions of Soviet
goals and thinking in the areas of
foreign policy and arms control.
Limberg, as chief of the division.
repons directly to the secretary and
the principal officials in Lhe State
Department. SincetheMiddle East
crisisbegan.Lirnbetg'sdivisionhas
been working 12—hour days widt-
out weekends.

Limberg focused on Soviet for-
eign policy in the Middle East. “I
would like to say that it is almost at
a resolution," he said. “bull can’t.
The best that we can expect or hope
for is a search for a diplomatic
solution. Regrettably. a mi tary
solution still remainsa possibility.“

Limberg summarized the past
record of dealings between the su-
perpowers, which were almost all
confrontations in “zero-sum“ terms:
namely. if we win, they lose. The
Soviet Union and the United States
have been on opposite sides of
conﬂicts with little exception from
the end of World War Two to this
year.

“Our relations have been hin:
deredbyamutualdistrust.”Limberg
said.

There has also been strong
competition between the United
States and the Soviets in the third
world. Bearing this in mind, Lim-
berg addressed the reasons that the
Middle East has been a source of
tension between the two countries
Limberg attributed this to three
factors. First. it has been an inher-
ently unstable region because of
Arabian conﬂicts. Second. it is an
area that is resource rich to the
entire world, and is vitally tied to
the economies of both sides' allies.
Third. it is a geographically impop
rant area, as it sits to the south of the
Soviet Union, and thcrcfore the
paths of America and the Soviet
Union cross.
