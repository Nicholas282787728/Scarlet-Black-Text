Student Evaluations: Consumerism vs. Academic Pursuit, cont. from p. 1

ingly evaluating aspects of the tn»
structor besides the teaching itself.
The Chronicle found that when stun
dents receive higher grades on ex-
ams, they tend to rate tlle instructor
more positively. One assistant prop
fessor cited by The Chronicle “gives
multiple-choice rather than essay
exams and asks students to evaluate
research papers rather than write
their own."

“Some ofthe trustees agreed that
no single number [of evaluations] is
adequate to evaluate faculty, and
multiple measures will be required."
the minutes said. However, the '1‘ ruste
ees view the issue as a ﬁnancial one,
with the student as the ultimate cus-
tomerr They “want ways to measure

what is beillg done at the college so
that they can see what they are gctr
ting for the money."

As students become vrewed more
as customers of a college, “keeping
the customer satisfied" becomes
more of a priority. Assistant Profes-
sor Robert S. Owen of the Univer-
sity of New York College at Oswego
told The Clll‘OlllL‘lt’ that students are
treated “a \torner in a retail en-
vironmen ind I have to worry about
customer complaints "

With Such things occurring at in-
stitutions around the nation. Girnnell
must examine itselt‘. Because this is
a touchy topic, litany facility mem-
bcl's will not comment on the issue.

Students, however, feel that in

accompany me home."

Others believe that the children
are hamtless. Michael Fischer ‘98
stated, “i don‘t find anything annoy-
ing about them."

In addition to harassment and
theft, college—owned property has
been vandalized. Over winter break,
glass doors were broken and the
women‘s locker room was ﬂooded
after a toilet was plugged and repeat
edly flushed. As recently as last
week. the soap dispensers were bro-
ken beyond repair.

“I am glad that the kids have a safe
place to hang out, but they shouldn't
abuse a privilege they have," said

Jeff Flint ‘01.

No plans have been made to I’Cm~
edy the security problems at the PEC.

The gym and swimming pool act
as a recreational facility for the come
tnunily Monday through Saturday in
the evening and Sunday afternoon .

According to Bauman, before the
PEC opened in 1971, and Grinnell
had only Darby Gym for physical ac-
tivity, the community proposed
building a Young Men’s Christian
Association. When plans forthe FEC
were made, the proposal‘ for the
YMCA was rejected arid the PEC
facilities were opened to the COt’I‘tmLIr

Death penalty,continued from p.1

individuals as stateAttorney General
Tom Miller and Archbishop of
Dubuque Jerome Hanus.

The few speakers for the bill emr
phasized the pain that the families of
victims feel. Death penalty advocate
Doug Peter ofSt. Charles insisted on
“Mak[ing] the punishment fit the
crime.“

‘Iowans Against the Death Penalty,
on the other hand, argue that it does
not deter crime, is notcost effective,
is racially and economically dis-
criminatory, and has and can con-

' demn innocent people.

Sentiment among Grinnell stu-
dents seems to be srmilarly anti-death
penalty, “1 think life wrthout parole
is sufficient on every count— in temis
of cost, humane treatment. and as a
deterrent," Stud Ali Neff '99. Missy
Roberts ’99 agreed. commenting,
“I‘m tlltttrdctltl’t penalty. It’s more
expensive than it‘s worth, and hypo-
critical most of the time."

Some students have more modere
ate views on the issu \ "I understand
the reason for having ' 'sald Molly
Brooks ‘98, “but I don't believe it's
actually a deterrent." '

 

 

 

 

general Grinncll students do not dis»
tort their evaluation t‘onns

“I think student evaluations are an
extremely necessary tool to decide
if a professor graduates to tenure,"
Sﬂld Cecily Wagner ‘98, “It is easy
to see from specific examples that
student evaluations could be valued
too much in determining faculty ten-
ure and this can be extremely dan-
gerous." ‘

It is precisely for this reason that
faculty have expressed concern.

Although using student evalua-
tions in the decision of whether a
faculty member receives a promotion
may be questionable, tenured Profese
sol of Russian John Mohan said, “the
evaluations over a period of two or

three years have value in deﬁning
broad patterns of strength and weak—
ness in an instructor or course "

Aside from student evaluations.
there are few available methods to
evaluate faculty. The Chronicle re-
ported that faculty members felt une
comfortable evaluating each other,
and are unable to find much consenr
sus.

The Executive Council Minutes
said that trustees are “particularly
concerned that a method be found to
measure the quality offaculty meme
bers now and to track that quality
over time.” One suggestion by face
ulty was that evaluations should cone
eentrate on “programs rather than
individuals."‘

BOOKS, continued from page 1

their college or at one nearby. After
becoming official members of the ore
ganizalion, students can also post adr
vertisements for books they wish to
sell.

The goal is to let students buy
used books for less than they would
at their campus bookstore and sell
them for maximum proﬁt, as well.

This ambition is often satisfied.
Arironomy-A Journey To The Cosmic
Fro/trier was the required text for a
Physics course offered during the
1997 Fall Semester at Grillnell Col-
lege. It was originally priced at
around $60 Students who sold the
book back to Nebraska Book Co.
received $20, and if the bookstore
later sold the text used, it would prob»
ably be marked at roughly $40.

However, a customer at Student

Market offered the same text (in
good condition) for $25., a price
both cheaper than expected for the
buyer and more generous for the
seller. .

Of course, online Visitors might
not always be lucky enough to con-
nect with other students in their area
who wtsh to buy or sell needed
books,

Grinnell College is not yet rcprcr
sented on the Student Market site, a
factor which might discourage some
students from taking advantage ofits
services.

However. the site still remains a
feasible option for students who feel
dissatisfied with their current text-
book marketing opportunit' '.
