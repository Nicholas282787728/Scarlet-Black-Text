Currently, Mukherjee is a professor

gel in touch with me fairly soon,"
said Crady.

Cameo Carlson, Cyclone Co-
Editor, said thatshc had spoken with
Crady’s secretary earlier in die year.
Carlson assumed that Crady would
sign release forms without reading
them. “I thought—shouldn’t be a
problem, and then BAMI ‘We need

Hodges was, “F-k the bullshit!” Olh-

Much of the novel takes place in a
small Iowa town.

Mukherjee wtll complete her
term as Grinnell College’s writer-in»
residence in Apni.

“[The grant Grinncll College
recieved] enabled Mukherjee to come
to Grinnoll for a total offour weeks,"
said Smith. “She will complete her
fourth and last week later this spring,
from April 6 to 10.“

Anyone who is interested in
meeting wilh Mukherjee at that time
should contact Smith as soon as pos-
sible.

“There'snota lot of ﬂexibility in
Bharati‘s schedule for this week,"
she said. “It’s pretty much booked,
but her return trip in April is still

open. Bharati likes to talk about stur
dents’ writing, but visits With her
don’t have to be limited to that. It
isn't necccsary for a student to bring
in a manuscript or article when they
come to visither. Some studenisjust
talk withherabout Indiaorabout her
impressions of America ."

Smith hopes that Mukheijee’s
Visit in the spring willnotbe the final
one, but thatitwill spark the creation
of a pen-nanent writer-in-residencc
program at Grinnell College.

“I hope that this program can
continue after the outside funds are
used," she said. “We are hoping that
it can be an ongoing, every year
occurance at Grinnell."

said Hodges.

The company objected to a phor
[Ogl'dph of an infant because it was a
full frontal nude. The picture was
cropped on the proof to rctnove any

Kantcr, who submitted the picture,
said that he was angry about the
company’s objections. ”They had to
hold up publication of the yearbook
until 1 got everything squared away,"
Kanter said.

A representative of Herff-Jones
justiﬁed the company's objection to
the photograph by saying that it might
”come back to haunt." Kanter later.

Carlson commented, “The man is
21 years old, he's graduating from
college, and this baby picture is going
to ‘comeback to haunthim’ because it
shows his penis? Come ON!“

Herlf-Jones also objected to
Kanter’s senior quote. “I had to en-
lirely change the quotation." said
Kanler. ”so I quoted an excerpt from
the first amendment about freedom of
speech.”

Hodges said that Crady's hesimr
tion to sign liability release forms is
unfounded: ”Like any radical bible—
