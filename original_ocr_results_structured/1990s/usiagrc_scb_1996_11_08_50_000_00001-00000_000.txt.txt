Panel explores relationship
between sexuality and religion

BY MELINDA JONEs
Staff Writer

“Faith and Sexuality: Affli‘minc7 Sexual
Identities." an informal panel discussion,
was held on November 4 in the Forum
South Lounge. Thc panel of seven mdlr
vlduals discussed views on tile topics of
church and faith as they relate to oiic's
sexuality.

Fcaturcd a' a nicinbcrol'the panel was
Reverend Mitzi Ellts, the Coordinator of
Church-College Relations with United
Church Board for Homeland Ministries
in Cleveland. Rev. EtllS has been active
iii the United Church of Christ Coalition
for Lesbian/Guy/Bisexual Concerns for
16 years, and is the current Chairpclson
ofCLOUT (Christian Lesbians Out).

Rev Eilts opcncd the talk by discuss
ing her own personal convtctions about
the relationship between faith and scxnr
ality. “Coming out, or as I call it, coming
home to myself as it lesbian, has been.
and will continue to be a spiritual tout»
ncy." she said,

Rev Ellis tllcn illustrated fivc convic-
tions or affirmations that she has formed
aboutthisi titinnship. "First,"Rcv Eilts
52nd, “sexuality rs a gift of ti loving. p s7
stoitatc Crctitur God." Shc went on to

point out that tlii gift was given to ct-
Cl‘yOttC. including people or differing
sexual orientations.

For her second conviction. Rev. ElllS
said. "I affirm that the Bible does not
make a clear statement ol'judnmcnt re-
garding homosexual bchtivint ' Shc
closely followcd this statement with .i
third affirmation. saying that "tlic Clll'H-
trail Church has not been consistently anll~
gay.” Contradictory opinions have helped
to form the Christian Church and mi
dciicc til past affirmations ol‘ Same-guts
dci commitments can be found in tlic
Church's history.

A fourth conviction dcttlt witlt the pos»
siblc imury done both to the Church and
to its mcmbctS by oxoludittg people based
on their scxuttl orientation. "The Body or
Clii-ist cannot be healthy as loll its even
one member suffers. I believe that ho
niophtihra within the Cllutcli is a total
contradiction to thc lrcctloin of new life
in Christ," said Rev. Ellis,

Finally. Rev. Ellis concluded her list
of conviction by pointing out that thc
Uliltcd Chil h of Christ has done more
work in favor of gay. lcshittir, and blSCXuttl
iiidivtrluals than any other Protestant faith
community. halving xpclll 20 yctrts Llfl'lrllh
