beliefs of as many Pagan religions
as possible, Since the term Paganism
includes many different religions, the
Pagan Discussion Circle helps stu-
dents explore the beliefs of these
many varied religions.

Jamie Heckert, another member
ofihc organization said, “The Pagan
Discussion Circle is a serious reli»
gious and spiritual organization. We
do not condone violence toward
other people, animals, or the earth.“
Graham Gelling said, “We are ordi—
nary people, We do not sacrifice
goals, or the such. We practice ac-
cepted and peaceful religions."
Alison Burek, another member ofthe
Pagan Discussion Circle, said.
“There is a great deal of negative
misunderstanding in this country
about what Pagans do, and I think a
lot of that is because the stereotypes
are really morc exciting, Basically,

The Pagan Discussion Circlc

locate the resources available to SGA
to best benefit the student body.

In ordcr to accomplish this goal,
SGA funds a Wide varicly ofstudent
resources. SGAreccivcs the major-
ity ofits funding front a 73% cut of
the activities fee, which is included
in your tuition (SPARC gets the

from things like the pinball machines
and the booksale. We pay for things
such as; concerts, ﬁlms, all campus
and special events (Harris, Waltz,
Alice etc. . . ), sports clubs and other
student group activities, as well as
the study breaks your SA throws. In
total, our semester budget is roughly
eighty-five thousand. This may seem
like a whopping amount. but in real»
ity many of the things we fund are
very expensive For example each

Supplies for group activities SGA
cannot fund food, transportation,

flce or by givmg it to us in person
(see door for office hours). The bud-
get must include who to contact, a
description of the activity and a de-
tailed explanation of the amount rc-

on Sunday nights and will make a
recommendation to joint board on
how much the student group should
be allocated. Joint Board has the
power to accept, amend or reject the
budget, If Joint Board approves
funding, the group can then collect
their money from us.

Many students on the Grinncll
Collcgc campus have recently bccli
engaged in conversations discussing
Paganism. Although most Grinncll
students know that there is ti campus
organization named the Pagan Dis-
cussion Circle, many do not know
what it does, what its members bcr
licve, or what Paganism is.

The Pagan Discussmn Circle is a
group that meets every Thursday
with the intent of talking about Pa-
ganism, different religions that fit
under the name Pagan, and religion
and spirituality in general.

The Pagan Discussion Circlcis an
organization that attempts to increase
the understanding of the various rc-
Iigions which are referred to as Pa-

gan, and il serves as a meeting place
forpcoplc ofvarious Pagan rcligions,

The term Pagan refers to many
different kinds ofl'eligions, and there
arc a few uniform bclicfs which uniic
all of thc religions that are called
Pagan. According to a web site at
htip:l/0ccan.st,usm.cdu/
%7Eghbooih/pagan.liiml, “Pagan
ism is a philosophy, a way of think-
ing, a nurturing, caring relationship
With Mother Earth. Paganism is an
Earth Religion, can-ied down to us
from cons ago, and is considered to
be one of the ﬁrst religions known
to humans."

Another web sitc at 1iiip://
www.nctscape,0rg/%7Eathomps/pa
gan/alt_pagan.htmll said, “Some
people believe Paganism to be a re-
ligion within itself; others see it as a
belief system (such as monotheism)

that can be incorporated into reli-
gions likc Wicca or Druidism: oth—
er: see it as a broad category includ-
ing many religions.” The authors of
tliissite continuetoexplainihatlhcrc
are many different kinds of Pagan
religions. The names range from re-
ligions such as nechhaman ism, mo,
Druidism, Church of All Words,
Wicca and Paganism. Just as the
names vary, so do the practices and
beliefs of each religion. The term
Paganism refers to a large group of
religions which may share a few be-
licfs.

Graham Gelling said, “Not all
Pagans believe the same things. The
ideas ofthc religions which are clas-
sificd as Pagan vary as much as
Christianity and Buddhism,” The
Pagan Discussion Circle seeks to
consider and talk about the ideas and

meets every Thursday from 7:00 -
9:00pm in Steiner. The group encour-
ages anyone with an interest in leam-
ing more about Pagan religions io '
attend one of their meetings, Indi-
viduals from the group also meet
throughout the year to celebrate vari-
ous Pagan holidays. Alison Buick
said, “The Grinnell College Pagan
Discussion Circle exists to provide
a safe and respectful forum for the
discussion of topics relating to the
modern Pagan religion," The Pagan
Discussion Circle is a group which
tries to promote understanding about
the many religions which are termed
Pagan. Graham Gelling said, "If you
are wondering something about us.
come to a meeting or ask one of us.
This is an open campus, and any of
us would be willing to explain Pa»
ganism to you,”
