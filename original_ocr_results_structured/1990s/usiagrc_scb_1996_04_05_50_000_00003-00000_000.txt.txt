me because the education budget for
rliis year uas seieral million dollars
below what Governor Bradshaw rec»
ommended. and this is a time of
budget surplus," Lake Stud. He also
seeks to encourage cnyironmenrally
conscious agriculture while protect<
ing the small farmer. Commercial
hog lots seemed to espeCially catch
his ire. “1 have lirrle symparhy for
large commercial farms that come in
disrupting communities and taking
over the cririre producrion process.
We should give more control back to
the community.”

He also vows to srop meaning—
less bills like the attempt to make
English the orricial language of the
state. “The House sponsors and Brad.
shaw said the bill would do nothing.
Why have the bill then!” Lake asked
