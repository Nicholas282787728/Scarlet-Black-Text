Hamlet, starring Mel

Gibson: Bard

By Rhys Jones

Franco Zeffirelli’s Hamlet is a
lively rendering of the tragic story,
with lavish sets, a dashing star (Mel
Gibson), beautiful costumes. plenty
of swordplay and leaping about the
screen,andjustenough ofthe textleft
so an audience can follow the story.

Unfortunately, one gets the feeling
that Zeffirelli would have left out
those terribly tortured, action-retard»
ing scenes and soliloquies if he could
have done so without losing all those
famous scenes and lines.

Though Zeifrelliand his co-screen-
writer. Christopher De Vere, have cut
the play to an acceptable feature-film
running time, itjust doesn't feel like
Hamlet. The entire Fortinbras sub-
plot was cut. and in the process some
of the play‘s most famous lines were
lost Even Ham let’s dying words had
to be rearranged to ﬁt tire editing.

Gibson’s performance is compe-
tent and enjoyable, but he is some-
what stranded in the intellectual void

on a Wire

of the production. Ian Helm does
some of the best supporting acting in
the film as Polonius, andGlenn Close
cannot help but be a wonderful
Gertrude.

Yet all the actors seem out ofplace.
The play’s alternating rhythms of
action and self-reflection have been
ﬂattenedoutintoasinglebrisktempo
that keeps one wondering when
Danny Glover is going to jump out
from behind a curtain and give Mel
“some back»up” with his .45 mag
num.

For all its faults, however.
Zeffirelli’sversionisundeniablyfun.
The entire audience, regardless of
backround oreducation, is gasping at
the shocking pans, laughing with the
jokes, and snifﬁng softly at the sad
pans. Shakespeare’s plays were in-
tended for the masses and in an age
when they‘ve been reserved for the
highlyeducated,itisrefreshing to see
one of them brought back to the
people. l think Shakespeare would

Spruced-up shrubbery seen in
« surreal Edward Scissorhands

By Jennifer Stukas

Once upon a time there was a
strangeboy named Edward (Johnny
Depp).withscissors for hands and a
pennanentblackleatherjacketsewn
ontohisbody,whowasleftallalone
in a castleon thetopofa hill. When
an overly friendly Avon saleslady
comes looking for customers and
finds him, crouched shaking in a
comer, he is taken forbetter orworse
to her suburb in the underlying val-
ley. There he falls in love with her
seemingly “normal” daughter
(WinonaRyder),whobecomestom
between her sterile middlevclass
upbringing and the uniqueness and
individuality of the new houseguest.

Thus begins the fairytale ofEdv
ward Scissorhands , both a child
ishly simplistic fable, and director

Tim Burton's satirical vision of the
stagnation and conformity of the
middle class.

Edward brings a note of unique-
ness to this Levittowndike suburb, in
which time and place are irrelevant
and unspeciﬁed. But although he
manages, superﬁcially. to change
some of the mundanity of suburban
life with his unique hair-cutting and
bushrcarving, in the end he is ostra»
cized like the classic outsider and
driven back to his castle. People may
welcome change in small quantiﬁes.
but they do not trust it.

Althoughmostofthecharactersin
this film lack substance and depth (of
course typical for a fairy tale) and
some of the points made are rather
obvious, the movie as a whole is
startlingly surreal and original in the
way it chooses to illustrate its moral.

Insignificant-e

The premise of Irrn'gniﬁ canceis, to say the least, intriguing. Characters resembling four of the most well-
knownpeoplealive in 1953- AlbertEinstein,Marilyn MonroeJoseph McCarthy,and Joe DiMaggio—
ﬁnd themselves alone together in a New York hotel room in the spring of that year. Fortunately,
Insigniﬁcance itself— director Nicholas Roeg’s 1985 release— is as consistently intriguing as its
original premise. This film makes for a funny, unusual, and ultimately rewarding cinematic experience,
As the four characters interact over the course of one evening, intimate details of their lives are shown
with vivid, telling detail. For example, the McCarthy character is distraught over his impotence, and the
Einstein character broods about the havoc wrought by atomic weapns, This ﬁlm presens aprovacative,
nostalgic look back at what might have happened had four of the 50‘s most famous (and infamous)
household names spent an evening togetherin thesame hotel room. Insignificant: will beshown tonight
and Saturday at 8:00 pm, and on Sunday at 2:00 pm, in ARH 302. -Brett Fechheirner

 

 

Birmingham boycott explored Restoration comedy
The City Heiress

 

in The Long Walk Home

By Louise Alcom

The Long Walk Home refers to the
walk that one black housekeeper had
to take during the bus boycott in Bir-
mingham in 1955-56. Whoopi
Goldberg, in a quiet but powerful
performance, plays a mother of three
who works for a white family in a
comfortable suburb.

This movie is largely about two
women’s responses to the difﬁcult
racial issues of the 1950‘s and 60‘s,
and their quiet but signiﬁcant rebel-
lions. Goldbergrebelsfrom thewhite

employer's rebellion flourishes when
she uses her car to ferry black work-
ers to and from the white neighbor-
hoods to work. in support of the boy-
cott andagainst her husband's wishes.

The Long Walk Home is a quietly
moving film which, though prone to
sentimentality, does not try to show
these women as extremes of courage,
but rather as reluctant but strong sol-
diers in a battle not of their choosing.
