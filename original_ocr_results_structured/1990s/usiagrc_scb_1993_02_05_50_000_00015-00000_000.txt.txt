Beilstein and Scott Newstrom all have significantexperienee. Beilstein
and Newstrom placed fourth and sixth at lastyear's league meet. Jonathon
Greenburg, a transfer student from Macalesier, adds depth and talent to
the middlemen.

Long distancean Mike Nawrocki. Chris Mills and Jeff Ulmer
should fare well in the 1500 alid 5K. Coach Freeman notes that senior

The Pioneers have always ﬁelded a strong pole vault crew and this
season will be no exception. Tom Nuzum. Dan Bro7oski and Rick
Wlederien all have gained experience over the last two seasons. Nuzuni

by Alex Severeus

1TH the Midwest Conr
ferenee heating up and
the season entering its

last month, the Grinncll College
men’s basketball team (8-8, 4-5) is
poisedioplay twocrucial home games
against conference opponents. Cor»
hell and Monmouth this Friday and
Saturday. Coach Dave Arseneault
says he has been eagerly awaiting
this weekend. “Our main goal has
been to post a winning record, and
that goal is very much within reach,
butwilh asweep this weekend weput
ourselves in reasonable contention
for a playoff berth." Earlier in the
season the Pioneers defeated Comet]
on the road, bill were narrowly deA
feated by Monmouth.

Last weekend the Pioneers
handed Carroll a decisive 9065 do
feat before falling, 79777, to a tough

’Beleit team. Arscneault credits the

triangle and two defenses which
caused confusion in the Carroll air
tack. “We kept the ball from their
wtngplayers, forcing theirpostplay—
ers toadiust. I was very pleasedatthe

disarray our defense caused." Ed
Brands and Steve Diekmann both
had strong offensive games with 21
points apiece. Geoff Johnson came
off the bench to add 17.

However, Beloit’s strong post
players proved to be just a hit more
than the Grinncll defense could
handle. “We forced their postplayers
to take outside shots, but they were
able to hit these shots. Their versatil-
ity makes them a very tough team to
beat,” Arseneault noted. Beloit’s inr
side players combined to score 24
points from outside the three-point
line. Brands again led the Pioneers
With 25 points, and Diekmann con-
tributed 19.

On Monday the Pioneers were
downed, 92-83, by a talented Grand
View squad. The Vikings withstood
Grinncll runs in the second half to
win.

Diekmann led the Pioneers in

and nine boards. Two other players,
Jason Francl and Brands, were in
double figures with 12 and 11 points
respectively. Todd Young and Craig
