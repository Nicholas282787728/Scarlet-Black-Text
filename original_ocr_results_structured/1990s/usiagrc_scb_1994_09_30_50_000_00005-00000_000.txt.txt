Chanticleer, the only full-time
professional a cappella vocal en»
scmblc in the U.Sl. has developed a
remarkable reputation for its intcrr
prctation of vocal literature, from Re»
naissance to contemporary, gospel
and vcnturcsomc new music. A
“seamlessblend”ofmalevoiceslang-
ing from countenenor to bass. this
group of 12 musicians has earned its
reputation as “an orchestra of voices"

Louis Botto founded this group
in San Francisco in 1978, and since
then, they have seen national as well
as international success Chanticleer
performs over 80 concens a year in
North America and Europe and has
released nine recordings. The style
of this group is hard to categorize.
since they present music from the
14th century as easily as newly-com-
missioned pieces.

The Chanticleer's concert in

Grinncll will display the group‘s verr
satility. Beginning with lothcentury
works of Thomas Weelkes, Orlando
Gibbons, Andrea Gabrieli and
Giovanni Pierluigi daPalestrina, the
singers will ﬁnish up the concerts
first half with ZOth century madl‘i-
gals. In tlte second half of the perfor
mance, a variety of American and
Chinese folksongs will be featured,
as well as popular, barbershop and
spiritual songs.

With musical backgrounds vary»
ing from Oregon to Texas and even
Iowa, the 12 members ofChanticlecr
arc cverchangingwne member is

while two others are rookies. How-
ever, one thing constant with this
group is the quality performances
they give; they’ve received rave re-
views from the Santa Barbara News
Press to the New York Daily News
which said Chanticleer was “the Olllr
standing male vocal ensemble whose
individual voices are as attractive to
hear as their ﬂawless blend.”

North Lounge, Forum

This is a personal favorite of
mine. The music is great, and John
Belushi and Dan Aylcmyd (as Jake
and Elwood Blues) are hilarious as
they try to reunite their old band to
save the orphanage where they
grew up. Together with their band,
they manage to getthemselves into
and out of some pretty sticky situ-
ations.
