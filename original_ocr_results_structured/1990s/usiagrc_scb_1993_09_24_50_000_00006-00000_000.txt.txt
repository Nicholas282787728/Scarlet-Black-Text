In response to Douglas Foster’s
letter last week about the New StUr
dent Days Workshop on Sexual I-Itle
rassmont, I would like to thank Doug
for his impression of the workshop.
It’s good to get feedback on projects
that have an impact on the campus
colnmunity. Since I feel to some tier
gree responsible for what went on
that night in Harris Center, I was
gteady disturbed to f ind that the mes»
sagel had thought we were convey-
ing had come across in such a convo—
Iuted manner.

The message that“it's OK to be
raped" perhaps twists what was be—
ing said. As a survivor, one must be
able to say ”This happened tome. It's
not my fault,” In that sense, it is
important that the Advocates vali-
date the feelings of a survivor and
acknowledgethatwhateverhappcned

did,infact,happen.This DOES NOT
tnean that “it is OK to rape."

Mr.Fosteralsostales”...Womcn
are being told that if they don't say
‘ycs‘ to a man when engaging in
sexual intercourse, they have been
raped.” I would slightly amend that
statement: If both partners DO NOT
express consent butengagc in sexual
activity, AND the power balance is
such that one partner feels s/he has
been raped, then s/he has in fact been
raped. This is a message to both men
and women and I [Cc] It is extremely
important. Expressed consent 13 mo
essary.

Whatdisturbed me mosttn read-
ing Mr. Foster‘s letter, was that he
seemed to tilrect all of his comments
at what women should and should
not do to preventbeing raped. While
it is always advisable for both sexes
to know your boundaries, have self
confidence, and be aware of poten-
tially dangerous situations, these

things will not guarantee safety. The
myth that“good girlsdon’tgetraped"
is precisely one of the myths that the
Advocates werctrying to breakdown.
Finally, victims of violent crime are
not responsible for that crime. Only
theperpctrators hold ultimatcrespon-
sibility for havtng committed the act.

I am glad the Mr. Foster has
voiced his opinion. but Ihink of how
great it would have been if he had
brought it up during the presentation
so that the audience as well as the
presenters could react to it and gener~
ﬂtediscussion from it. Myonly regret
from this year's Workshop is that we
did not have more probing questions
from theaudience to sparkenltghten-
ing discussion about the subject.

It is with the utmost care and
selectivity that we define the margins
of what constitutes a rape and what
does not, as it is a serious crime in
which the consequences are great for
all parties involved. Already falling
short of “innocentuntil proven guilty"
within lheabsurd realmsoflheschool
judicial procedures, Grinnell inlen»
tionally neglects the rights ofthe ac-
cused. Forhe is, letme pointout, just
that: accused.

Oddly enough, 34% of men ac-
cused ofrape say they did notbcltcvc
that they had committed a crime.
Stranger still, women too who have
been rapedoften never realize itthem-
selves. One might question why hu-
mans have lost their ability to distin-
guish a sexual assault. Does this not

tell us anything, and am [not the only
person who recognizes it?

I contend that we have not lost
this ability and that the “facts” which
were presented at the sexual assault
workshop were construed from a dif-
ferent system of labeling a crime of
the same name. Statistics are magi-
cal, powerful tools that have the abile
ity to dupe the masses with small
doses (and cited ones at that). Bull
was taught to learn statistics in order
not to be fooled by the statistician.
These statistics came from people
who believe that rape is an act com-
mitted despite reluctance by one party.
unvoiced objections, “some resise
tance"as the AttomeyGeneralconIi-
dcntly put it, or future regrets.

However there is another side to

 

Havingapparendyexhaustedhis
supply of sarcasticjokes about envi-
ronmentalists and Hillary Clinton,
Doug Foster has recently chosen to
turn the wrath of his conservativeeye
against the seemingly unassailable
work of the campus advocates, an
organization whose primary function
is to serve as nothing more than a
source of support and strength for
survivors of sexual abuse on the Grin-
nell campus. In doing so, Mr. Foster
makes two fundamental mistakes.

However,beforeIlevythiscriti-
cism, letme makeapoint of Conccsr
sion. Mr. Foster does make a pains»
taking effort to remind us thatrape is
bad and to be avoided at all costs.
(”Being raped is horrible") Lest
therebeany confusion. Iagree. Thank
you Doug.

Mr. Foster suggests that in their
presentation tonew students thecame
pus advocates failed to emphasize
the imponance of exercising com-
mon sense and taking preventative
measures to avoid sexual abuse. In

fact,theadvocates madeseveral overe
lures to this effect, The students
made a purposeful effort to present
statistics that would illustrate the
prevalence and danger of sex ual abuse
- I in 4 women will be victims of
sexual abuse before they graduate
from college and every 6 minutes a
woman is raped in the U.S. The
intendedcffectofthesestatistics,and
the presentation as whole, was to
raise the awareness of students as to
the pervaslveness of sexual abuse.
The advocates felt no need, at this
point, to belabor and propagandize
the heinous nature ofrape. ltwas our
belief that the statistics spoke for
themselves. In addition the advo-
cates devoted an entire section of the
presentation to the issue ofmiscome
munication, attempting to establish
that communication, if properly exe
ercised, can be the most effective
means of prevention.

These attempts to raise aware-
ness and offer preventative solutions
notwithstanding, the primary func-

tion of the campus advocates, as I
alluded earlier, is to provide support
and empowerment for the survivors
ofsexual abuse. Itisin regardsto this
function that Mr. Foster offers his
most erroneous and dlslurbing con
clusion. Mr.Fosterinsinuatesthatby
focusing on the empowerment and
emotional progression of survtvors,
the advocates have implicitly devale
ued the honor of rape. Perhaps what
Mr.Fosterdoesnotundcrstandtsthat
the occurrence of sexual abuse in
today’s society is a forgone conclu»
sion. No amount of preventative
lifestyle adjustments will eradicate
its existence. It is an issue which
mustbeaddressedfrommullipleper-
spectivcs , some preventative, some
theoretical, and sonic emotionally
supportive.

Fortunately, there exist a numr
ber of student organizations on tile
Grinnell campus that participate in
addressing these various perspectives,
and serving in a variety of roles.
FEARLESS -Cncouragingindividu-

als wtthin a culture of gender based
violence to protect themselves and
others, PAFA . attempting to erode
the sexist theories and institutions
that inspire the societal imbalance
which facilitates sexual abuse, and
CHANGE & JUSTICE , attacking
the rules and institutions of our own
campus community that invite [Cr
construction.

As long as there is sexual abuse,
there Wlii be a need for advocates , to
listen, to support, and to understand
assurvivorsstruggle to heal theemo-
tional woundsof sexual abuse. Ironie
cally, it is Mr. Foster himself, con-
tt-tbutingtothestigmatizationofrape
victims by implying that there are
instances of rape in which the cire
cumstances justify a woman “must
suffer the inevitable emotional con-
sequences," who illustratesjust how
important this support structure is.

John Kern, ‘94

the story. There is the side that says if
someone pressures or guilts you into
having sex and you give in for what-
ever your own reasons are, you have
notbeen raped. If you dranktoomuch
and did something you regret, you
have not been raped. If you Ilave not
been forced to have sex, then you
have not been raped.

This is the reality of it. The law
defines [an] act between persons as
sexual abuse if I) The act is done by
force or against the Will of the other.
If the consent or acquiescence of the
other is procured by threats of vio
lence toward any person or if the act
is done while the other is under the
influence of a drug-induced sleep or
is otherwtseinastuteofunconscious»
ness, the act is done against the Will
of the other. 2) Such otherparticipant
is suffering from a mental defect or
lncapacity which precludes giving
consent, or lacks the mental capacity
to know the right and wrong of con
duct in sexual matters. 3) Such other
person is a child. (Code of Iowa,
709.1)

These laws must be clearly
stated, leaving no room for doubt
such as the kind that was created at
the workshop. That doubt prompted
questions such as “Well, what if I
have a friend who thinks she may
have been raped?" to be turned over
to a noneprofessional youth widi less
than a day’s worth of training. The
deep psychological trauma of rape
and the possible steps to take against
an attackershould be dealt with more
seriously by someone who under-
stands the law better than that which
was cwdenced at the sexual assault
workshop.
