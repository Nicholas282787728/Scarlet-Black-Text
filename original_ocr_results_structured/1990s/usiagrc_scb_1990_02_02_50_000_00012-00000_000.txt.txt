WOmen Flying High

The Grinneii Pioneers
women’s basketball team had an
important and overall successful
week, as it accumulated two out
of a possible three victories
against conference foes.

Last’ weekend, the Pioneers
traveled to Illinois to face both
Monmouth College and the Knox
Siwash. Grinnell managed a
split, defeating Monmouth by the
score of 7967, but losing to
Knox in an overtime
heartbreaker. 71765.

The Lady Rams of Cornell ’

College came to town on
Wednesday night to face an
extremely upbeat Pioneer squad.
The Grinneliians pro-game
music, which included the
Eagles‘ hit, “There's Gonna Be A
Heartache Tonight,” seemed
prophetic as the Pioneers
trounced Cornell by the count of
86-34. The victory upped
Grinnell's record to 9-5 overall,
4-2 in conference play.

The Pioneers dominated from
the opening tip. Grinneii was
able to find open passing lanes to
the post area, where senior center
Laura Van Sickle set up shop.
The relentless inside play
included a plethora of offensive
rebounds which were converted
into easy baskets. The Pioneers
showed a good deal of patience,
too, moving the ball freely in
order to find the open shot.

The offense was not alone in
smoothness Grinnell used a
hawking, full court, woman-tor
woman defense which comﬂ'huted

Coach Issues Challenge

By Ted Eskiidsen

Having coached basketball for
16 years from junior high teams
to NAIA Division 11, I’ve been
very lucky to be a part of many
games in a number of unique, and
sometimes strange places. From
Presque Isle, Maine to Salem,
West Virginia to the Bronx, New
York, every place had something
special about it that always
seemed to help the home team by
creating a basketball aunosphere.
In those 16 years, I've never
seen a better home court than
Darby Gym. There is a character
that the building has that makes
you feel like you are playing in
your living room with your
family watching, As comfortable
as it is for our players, it can be a
dreaded den for opponents. If you
are an opposing team and don’t
feel that special something about
Darby, you don‘t respect the
game. Darby can truly be a
home court advantage.
This time of the year can be
fun. Teams begin to play their
best basketball. Games begin to

to countless steals and a few
quick fastrbreak buckets, This
tremendous control of tempo
moved the Pioneers to a 21~81¢ad
with 10 minutes remaining in the
first half. Then, for all intents
and purposes, the Pioneers
slammed the door on Cornell
with a 20-2 run, which gave
Grinneli a 4140 margin with 3
minutes left in the first half.

The second half was more of
the same, with senior center
Laura Van Sickle proving too
tough in the pivot. She led all
scorers with 31 points on the
evening, and grabbed 11 rebounds
as well. Junior guard Missy
Sharer chipped in with 11 points,
8 assists, and 7 steals. The
Pioneers outrebouttded Cornell
by a 46—22 spread, and shot 50%
from the field, while holding the
Lady Rams to an abysmal 28%
from the floor.

Coach Ted Eskildsen
commented on the Pioneers
ability to move the ball well on
offense. “Even though it was
lopsided, we showed good, solid
ball movement. if you move the
ball well, you get quality shots."

The Lady Pioneers hope to
continue their success against
arch-rival Coe on Tuesday,
Feb.6, at 7:00 at Darby Gym.
They will also have home games
against Mount St. Clare on
Thursday, Feb.8, at 7:00, and
Monmouth College on Saturday,
Feb. 10, at 2:00. Find your way
to Darby on these days and help
the Pioneers provide heartaches
for their hardwood opponents.

get tougher, more competitive,
and many times the home court
advantage is the deciding variable.
From my first visit to
Grinnell, I knew what a great
place Darby was, and i also knew
that great things could happen
there. I've seen knowledgable
crowds enjoy hard nose efforts
and appreciate well played games.
i have yet to see Darby packed to
the point where there are no seats
left. I believe it can happen
because the Crime“ College
community rallies around the
quest for excellence. That's one
of the reasons were all here; we're
attempting to create excellence.
For Darby Gym to provide
the very best home court
advantage, we want to pack the
place. It will be special. Our
men and women still have a lot
of basketball ahead of them. In a
very big game, on Tuesday,
February 6. at 7:00 p.m., our
women’s basketball team will
work toward their goals. It could
be something that is shared, if
Darby, our friendly confines, is

 

packed. See you there'.7

Once upon a time, the
Grinnell men‘s basketball
program attracted a fairly large
and loyal following. The Rat
Pack and Bums' Bellow created an
aura of excitement in Darby
Gymnasium which brightened the
otherwise dreary winter nights.
People would come to Darby and
support the Pioneers, win or
lose, in part because the Pioneers
played exciting basketball. The
games were also a place to blow
off academic steam and to cheer
just for the fun of making a lot
of noise without being hasslod by
the quiet freaks in the dorms.

The last few years has seen
crowd support steadily decline,
despite the fact that the team's
fast-paced attack is more exciting
than ever. Such lack of interest
bewilders Coach Dave Arsenault
who insists the current squad
plays as close to their potential
as any team he has coached.
Arsenauit believes enthusiastic
support, although it may not
immediately translate into wins,
will "reward the players for their

January.
Although the record may not

reflect it, the team is much

offset with the return Dave

Chamberlain in Arsenault's
opinion is a "very good player
who will only get better".

Women‘s Swimming

Swimmers
Suffer at
Coe Meet

By Holly Keliar

The first weekend of the
second semester was a tough and
tiring one for the women’s
swimming team. Compcting
against seven other teams,
Grinnell scored 116 points for
sixth place in the Stouffer’s
Invitational at Coe.

Coach Sheila Cain admits
that the moot “wasn‘t particularly
good," noting that the
competition is tougher every year
with the addition of more
division I and II teams, making it
harder for Grinnclt to compete.

Grinnell did not place in the
top six in any race.

“It was a tiring two days,"
said Cain, who hoped that the
meet would prepare the team for
Conference, which will seem
easy after Coe.

The next meet is Friday. Feb.
2 against Northeast Missouri.
who Cain describes as a tough
team. The main goal of the meet
will be to see who will swim
what at Conference. After that
will be the State meet on Feb.
10 against other Division 111
schools in Iowa, which Cain is
“looking to win.” “We just need
to keep concentrating on the
State meet and Conference."

leadership in his second year of
captainship as well as scoring
13.2 points per contest. Holland
Neal has used his two and a half
years experience at the point to
his advantage, dishing out a team
leading 39 assists. Freshman
Wendell Barber, although not a
pure point guard. has filled that
role in thrilling fashion with
plenty of behind the back drives
and no look scoop passes. The
bench posseses talented
sophomore Shaan Hamilton who
plays well on both ends of the
floor and could be the surprise of
the second semester.

With eight games remaining,
the team can still achieve
respectability. A warm home
welcome against Coe on
Saturday, February 10 would
deﬁnitely help. Coe is a great
team to hate and a large abusive
crowd just might be the right
medicine to cure the Pioneer‘s
ills. So escape from that
Saturday evening pre-party
purgatory and come support the
Pioneers, they deserve it.
