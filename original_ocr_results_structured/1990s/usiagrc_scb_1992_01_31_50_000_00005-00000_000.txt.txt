:performance moves many to tears

'

By Papa Owusu

ln commemoration of Dr. Martin
‘Luther King’s birthday, the duo of
x Craig Edwards and JoannaRhinehart
treated Grinnellians to a splendid
' portrayal entitled “TheJ oumey of the
bDrum Major... the Legacy of the
(Movement? The performance took
place on Wednesday, January 22, in
‘ Roberts Theatre.
. Theplaylooked attheCivilR'tghts
era and the leadership of Dr. King
‘ through the eyes of Helen M. Nichols.
r the first Black woman to be mayor of
Chicago. Nichols, played by the 91.
‘ cgant Rhinehart, vividly recounts
> Civil Rights history and Dr. King's
l leadership through her reminisces.
Her high—pitched voice, sometimes
* shrill, sadly echoes the pain and hor-
. ror African-Americans lived through
in the 50’s and 60's. She recalled
" such momentous events as the Mom-
. gomery Bus Boycott and Dr. King’s
famous “I Have A Dream“ speech.
Craig Allen, featured as Dr. King,
‘ represents the Old Movement, which

served as the inspiring force behind
Helen Nichols‘ New Movement.
Sporting a neat haircut and a natural
build just like those of the slain civil
rights leader, Craig Allen could eas»
ily pass for a resurrected Dr. King
revisiting Grinnell. He spoke in a
near-perfect imitation of Dr. King's
southern accent With such consum-
mate artistry, he portrayed King not
only as a civil rights leader, but also
as a committed family man.

Educating, entertaining and infor-
mative, theplay enabled onerorelive
the civil rights era under Dr. King’s
leadership. Overall, it was spectacur
lar; the audience cheered the cast to a
three-minute standing ovation at the
end.

In his earlicrintroductory address,
Eric K. Wynn, Director of
Multicultural Affairs, stressed the
importance of multicultural educa—
tion. He explained that, given U.S.
demographic trends of disproportion-
ate increases in minority population.
a multicultural curriculum is more
important now than ever.

PresidentFerguson began her key-
note address on a bright note, calling
theeveningaspeeialone“to honorthe
intelligence, the courage and thespirit
of Martin Luther King, Jr." She re-
minded the audience that Dr. King
could be called a Grinnell alumnus,
after speaking here on October 29,
1967. and receiving an honorary doc-
torate from the college.

The President also emphasized a
multicultural education, calling it a
response to King’s vision of “a new
structure of interrelatedness.“ “‘All
life is interrelated. and all humankind
iscaughtin an inescapable network of
mutuality," she said, quoting Dr. King
and apparently suggesting that
multiculturalism was thebrainchild of
the revered civil rights leader.

President Ferguson urged Grinnell
to lead America to “establish a genur
ine community based on an enriching
diversity..tthat‘swhatMartinLuther
Kingwanted,andthat’swhywehonor

performance was one not soon to be
forgotten.
