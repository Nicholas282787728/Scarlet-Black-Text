To the campus community:

Now I have experienced the feel
ings Nat Ward drew upon when he
spoke ofa diminishing feeling oftrust
within the campuscommunity. Fortur
nately, but to his confusion, his be-
longings were returned after appeal-
ing to the morals of the person(s) who
wrongfully took his belongings. Sim-
ply put, stealing is wrong and the per4
son realizedthisandthen subsequently
did what was the correct thing to do.

There was a time this year when
Ileftall my booksand supplies up on
the third ﬂoor of Burling to go to
dinner and returned to find every—
thing untouched. That‘s a wonderful
trust to be able to leave one’sbelongr
ings alone for hours and not have to
worry about them being ”disturbed."
It’s also a very securing feeling to
live in a town where the proprietorof
the bakery trusts late night bakery
runners to go outihe frontdoor where
the set of keys to the shop rest, not
worrying about anyone taking them.

It's not very assuring of the trust
and respect extant to drop off books
for an organized book sale and return
to pick them up and find that one of
them has been stolen. Someone on
thiscampusposscsses my Calculus II
book.

I was not initially bothered by
this trivial matter of money until I
started thinking about the fact that
this action is representative of one
stitch inalargerfahrichdoesn’tiake
too much before the cohesiveness of
the community trust begins to cor-
rode. I‘m willing to give the person a
chance to return the book to me with
or without an explanation.

So please check inside the cov—
ers of your Cale 11 books. Someone
has mine, Hypothetically speaking,
justassume that the $25 requested in
exchange for the text would be just
enough for me to meet the difference
to pay for private music lessons. If
you can not afford to pay for the book
and need it for class, return it tome at
the end of the semester, but please
send me a note informing me of this.
My personal fabric of community
trust rests upon this action.

Party Report: Blitzed
Surgeons Save Lives

Partiers ﬂocked Ki zi non-college-owned house last
Friday night The theme of the party was “Boozing and
Whor'tng,” and guests were encouraged to dress and behave
in a way appropriate to the theme. Thepany was attended by
about six people, often dancing shoulder to and intenwined
wiur one another hr the house’s mtirlit living room, Guests
included several past 5&8 staff members,

Cans of beer were placed irr guests’
hands as they reached the door, and mses
more awaited them in the refrigerator. The \s
party’s host explained that in order to avoid —
having to charge people at the door, he
insisted on apolicy ofEYOC (Bring Your
Own Condoms).

Partiers guzzlod beer, occasionally forcing it into their
others' stomachs, while smoking cigareties and dancing to

by booze by midnight, were at all selective about whom they
gropcd and slapped and French kissed.

foamy climltx. One guy was unable to resist slapping the
butt of awoman as shebent over to pick upa beer can from
the floor. With assistance, he finally tackled her and gave

her a good licking.

After this entertainment, the group broke up more or
less into couples and conducted a compcleuon to see which
couple could be the most croticaliy filthy (it was hard to Hell
exactly what they were doing,..), while two other guests
slouchcd down low in chairs to discuss “death" in the work
of Thomas Mann (this Li Grinncll, still).

One woman was seen pointingatabulge in man'spants
and buckling over with laughter. “Look at that! Thosepants

KNOX from page 6

lio to show or perform a scene. You
need to explain concepts and goals
for something that hasn’t happened
yet,“ Knox explained.

Knox’s own goals in her own
theater work are definitely not nebu-
lous. cht weekend’s production of
Machinalservesasatypicalexarnplc
of the socially conscious work she
prefers to stage, reﬂecting issues that
are present in today’s society.

“it is amazrng thata play written
in 1928 addresses things we deal with
now. This play touches on the
woman’s role in society, abortion,
homosexuality, death penalty, and
much more. As someone told me,
this play is a very ‘Grinnellian
choice,” Knox said.

That unique ‘Grinnellian’ way
is very much part of the reason why
Knox chose to return as a guest direc-
tor. She described this visit as ”a
chance to return to the scene of the
crime.”

Knox also feels Lhatmuch hasn’t
changed since she graduated in 1979;
to her observation. Grinncll is still
very much a cocoon, an isolated
pocket of diversity in the corn fields.
However, she detects a general trend
of people becoming more career ori»
cnted and less politically active.

“Of course,” Knox acknowl-
edged, “I was with a bunch who grew
up in with the sixties; you were an
activist, that’s what you did, This
generation of students. grew up in the
Reagan and Bush eras."

Despite the growing trend of
specialization. Knox feels that an
education in the liberal arts is more
imponanl than ever. “An education
can’tbe too one—sidedToday getting
a B.A. is only the beginning of an
education. You need to be knowl»
edgeable in a variety of fields. Be-
sides, people change their minds, I
know several fellow theater majors
who are lawyers or professors. This
is the time to do what makes you
happy."

Just as the student body can be
said to be more conservative, Knox
observes a nationwide trend of con-
servatism toward the ans, stemming
partly from a lack of national cultural
policies. The effects of this trend are
being felt on this campus, according
to Knox.

“When I was here, we had no
controversy in the theater department
such as Professor Gordon, so I can‘t
comment on the attitude toward the
ater at Grinncll then. But I am dis»
turbed by the general impressionI’ve
received of the administration‘s, or
maybe it’s the trustees’, unwilling-
ness to be receptive to expanding the
department.

“On the other hand, while I was
a student here, there were no guest
directorsordesigncrs forcollegepro-
ductions.”
