Panel Questions What Will Follow Communism

By Tom Gregg

At the close of the Roscnl'leld
Conference on Eastern Europe.
several lecturers and Grinncll pro-
fessors participated in a panel dis-
cussion on Eastern Europe. Dis-
cussion was based on the previous
three days of lectures. Panelists
questioned whether or not the East-
em Europcan counLries would do
vclop in to stable democracies now
that the old govemmenls are out.

Robert Grey, professor of po-
litical science, took a “basically
pessimistic" stance, saying that
democracy was unlikely in than
future becauseof thrccthings. First,
the countries are now fragmented,
having been “united by what they
were against rather than what they
were for.”

Second, poets, rock musicians
and other members of the intelli-

gentsia are good at tearing down
the old order. but "the hard part
comes now,“ when thesame people
are called upon to build new gov.
emments. ’I‘hird, these countries
have no tradition ofllbcrnl democr
racy. so any change to democratic
forms of government will not be
easy.

Similarities and differences be-
tween post-World War 1 Europe
and post-Cold War Europe were
pointed out by Daniel Kaiser, proV
fessor or history. The main dlllct’r
ences are that the population is not
expanding now, the population is
moreurbanandeducated,andtr/chr

as the invention of fax machines
and rock music have taken place.

Group Helps Des

more than just a lobby group. it
works with homeless both in Des
Moines and in Grinnell, and is a
strong example or college involve-
ment in the community

This year, however. there have
been several changes in the orga~
nizalion or the program. One in

ing the time of departure to Des
Moines every Saturday from the
Fomm from 11 rim to 10 am. A17
though this time change may seen
negligible, itis in fact an imponant
change, according to Caleb Rush,
one of the chief organizers of Stu»
dents Helping the Homeless.

By leaving earlier, volunteers
now arrive at the Catholic Worker
Community Center in time to eat
lunch with the staff and Visitors, in
hopes of getting to know thepeople
who come to the center and thereby
breaking down some social barri-
em

“The focus is more on education
than on service. We think that real
education requires seeing more
that’s ouLsideofcampus," explained
Rush. “We don't mean to deny the
fact that we are also capable of
providing service to Catholic
Worker Community“

Education itself is recognized as
an impoan first step towards
change, because “poverty is per—
petuated and facilitated when people
don’t know the victims." During
the day at Catholic Worker Comr
munity (which despibeits namcand
Catholic origins is not religiously
affiliated), student volunteers as-
sist the full time staff in domestic
chores and play with and look after
children.

Meeting families and children
in povcrty is an eye-opener in itself
for students on the program.

“It puts a quick halt to the atti-
tude that people are poor because
it’s their own fault," said Rush.

Catholic Worker Community.
part of a national network, sees
itself not as a shelter in the sense of
an institution for people who need
tobetaken care of, but asa group of
individuals who live by the belief
that it is the duty of people who
have houses and food to share with
those who don’t

Rush and other organizers or

recognize the challenges and occa-
sional limitations involved in rais-
ing student awareness through the
program. but that does not daunt

“We are aware of that challenge
and we‘re always looking for new
and creative ways to meet it, and I

“We have noon buffet every day 11-1,

Grey doubted that the intema-

Speaker Talks of Europe's U-Turn

By Sharyn Obsatz

“If you were in jail two years
ago, you’re in Parliament; if you
were in Parliament two years ago.
you‘re on your way tojail." said
professor Pedro Ramet in his
Convocation lecturedescribing the
current political situation in East-
em Europe.

In his speech, "The New Great
Transformation in Eastern Europe,"
Ramet discussed the key factors
which led to the revolutions in
Eastern Europe, pointed out which
events were turning points in the

Great Transformation.

Ramet described what he called
“the anatomy of arevolution,“ list-
ing what he felt were the eight
factors which led to the “destabili-
zation" of Eastern Europe: eco
nomic deteriomtidn, the mobiliza»
tion of new groups, the defection
of intellectuals, inefﬁciency and
corruption. loss ofcredibility, los:
ofself-confidenceamongelitesand

“facLionalizalion,” inept useofforce
and theexpectancy ofchangeby the
people of Eastern Europe.

The presence of these factors in
Eastern Europe created a political
environment which was ripe for
revolutionary change.

According to Ramct, several
events in Poland and Hungary bc-
twccn 1978 and 1989, particularly

the emergence of the Polish Soli-
darity movement. the Polish strikes
of 1988 and the opening of Hun-
garian borders with Austria were
imponant in releasing thispotential
for revolutionary change,

Ramet stressed the role of both
the intellectuals and the church as
the leading forces in these revolu-
lions,

“Intellectuals,” said Ramet.
“served as alternative poles of le-
gitimacy"atatime thatthepolitical
establishment was losing credibil—
tty.

These intellectuals protested the
government by creating “an alter-
native society builtfrom the ground
up,"urrough“attcmativeplays,rock
music.classes,researchinstitutions,
etc. . ." Churches backed up these
efforts. providing a safe meeting
place for revolutionary groups and
funding many of the alternative in-
stitutions.

Rarnet acknowledged that the
transformations of countries in
Eastem Europe are progressing at
differing rates.

He explained that some of these
societies are stronger than others
because they possess better orga-
nized political groups: better edu-
cated, more historically-minded
citizens; and haveabctter informa-
tion system with which to coordi-
nate the refomiers' effons.

the economic sanctions against Iraq
have been effective.

In response to President Bush‘s
suggestion that the Iraqis may soon
be in possession of nuclear weap—
ons, the PGA members point out
that America supported Iraq when
it used chemical weapons against
its own Kurdish minority and
against the Iranians during the Iran
Iraq war. They suggest thatBush‘s
mentioning of a nuclear threat is
merely an attempt to increase sup»
port for the US. intervention.

Both Werner and Wittstruck say
they feel obliged to take steps to
prevent a war in the Gulf region.
They add that they would not feel
comfortable with haVlng done
nothing if war were to occur. and
hope that their activities will en-
courage others to take a stand.
