College was Very pleased with [he
performanceofthefunt‘lrraiser. “The
Kolpins deserve a lot of credit for
that," said Mickey Munley ’87, the
Director of Annual oivrng,

The Kolpins instrumented some
changes in the organization of the
campaign, which partially enabled
the success of the campaign. The
primary change was a reorganization
of the structure of the “gown,” or
College, aspect of the fundraising
program so it would operate like the
“town"system. As Munleyexplalnecl,
organizersfromtheCollege were able
to attract and include more volun—
teers by switching to a “pyramid"
structure of organ nation.

Students may still not realize
how the tensions expressed during
last year‘s racial demonstration still
persist, continuing to force a re-
examination of Grinnell’s commit»
ment to the multicultural Communl'
ty.

Last spring, on March 10, some
minoritystudentsworerapeovettheir
mouths, and signs demonstrating var—
ious concerns they had for the multi—
cultural environment at Grinnell
College. The day—long demonstra»
tionculminated that evening assome
oftheparticipantspubliclyexplained
the collective and personal reasons
whythev, as minority students, were
uncomfortable.

The tensions which brought on
the demonstration did not end at
this Speak Bitter, however. ASpeak
Easy on March 12 was arranged in
which all students were invited to
share their opinions and react to
hopes of initiating an ongoing dia-
logue. Community reactions also
included administrative meetings
With minority student leaders, Stu»
dent initiatives, and plans for a di»
versity initiative committee.

Yet, according to three minority
students interViewed, the issues they
personally raised before, during, and
after the demonstration have not fad»
ed away.

In evaluating the improvements
to Grinnell‘s multicultural commue
nity Delaney Dixon ’98, Grinnell’s
ACE coordinator and participant in
last year’s demonstration, remarks
that events here are now “n0t geared
to one type ofstudent."

Yet, when more specifically ad—
dressingherparticipntioninthedem.
onstration she concludes that ”we
could have [taken] more charge of
the situation." She later adds her
belief that “students didn’t keep the
pressure on...it was an extremely
emotional and stressful time."

Dixon's current concerns in.
clude n fear that ”people just think,
{minority students] were grrpingg"
and that the demonstration was a
onenrne event. “i think you can say

Multiiultural issues still a concern

it‘s a cycle that repeats itself," ob—
serve Dixon. She believes that the
acqu on of the BCC and black
library in the 1970’s marks the last
time demonstrators were successful
in addressing AfricanrAmericai-i is—
sues. Conceming the issues “still on
the table," Dixon warns, “the longer
we wait, the more ground we’re los—
ing.

The ACE coordinator stresses
the ability of SGA to effect change
and hopes that “the greater
community,..will address this issue
and the burden won’t be left on the
multicultural students.”

Rachel Weiss ’98 did not particr
ipate in the demonstration but, as a
self—proclaimed "American Jewish
Woman," she says ”we need a place
to go and not be different." Weiss
also considers that a Jewish Resource
Center would better enable students
to interact with the Jewish commu«
nity. She explains, “It’s not about
creating resource centers or space for
people to go and take their ethnicity
off campus...we inVite people to come
and learn."

Weiss also observes that her
multicultural concerns are “about
people taking advantage of opportu»
nities." Weiss acknowedges that it’s
“hard to feel like an outsider," and
th r participation in Chalutzim ac—
ti ties might be difficult forstudenvs
for that reason. Yet, Weiss’ own
experience as an "outsider" explains
herwishto “make [students] feel they

will always have a place at Shabbat
table."

Weiss cites the recent Shahbat
celebration on August 18th, which
included various multicultural stu—
dents, as confirmation that students
can come together and celebrate the
diversity represented by Judaism.

On the other had, diveisitv is
not always a cause for celebration at
Grinnell. Michael Jacobs ’98 ex—
ptessesconcemovethowstubtlemc—
ism at Grinnell may still represent to
minorities “a scratch on their back
they can’t reach.” Jacobs notes his
personal feeling that multicultural
students “don’t feel welcome“ but
instead, uncomfortable.

Regarding the aftermath of last
year’s demonstration, he believes
”that a degree of paralysis set in." He
adds, “I’m really afraid that the derri—
onstmtion has resulted in a PC back—
lash—inwhich students are afraid to
beuncomfortable..rheyusePCtei-ms
and ignore the issues.” Instead of
personalizing and tationalizing cur.
rent perceptions, Jacobs suggests that
proactive progress really “involves
getting dirty" and trying to extend
beyond the personal biases he be
lieves people hold.

While Jacobs states thatindvidr
uals shold educate themselves ,he also
says that the “administration can
provide a starting point,” observing.
that the college should not have a
”hands off" approach while the cure
riculum itselfmav still be biased.
