offthe court with her energetic attir
tude and experience.

in her capabilities and stated,

lanes. She is also a very enthusias-
tie lender which will be very valu-
able to this team,"

a lot of action at both the fogward and
center positions while Johnson will

Hoopsters set for

exciting new season
Arsenault likes depth of team

Sports Information Office

With three straight years oi‘winn‘ing
under its bell, the Grinnell College
men’s basketball team is set for the
ride ofa new season. Tonight at 8:00
in Darby Gym the Pioneers host a
team from South Australia in their
season opener.

The contest is part of the Grinnell-
DeLong Tipoff tourney which also
features Mt. Mercy and Peru State,
Those teams play today at 4-00. The
losers of today’s games will play in
the consolation game at 5:00 on Sale
urday while the winners meet in the
championship match at 7:00.

“Our annual ripoff tournament
gives us a chance to get our feet wet
early . Playing at home gives our
players a nice shot of energy for the
two-day affair," commented Coach
David Arseneault. “I expect Mt.
Mercy and Peru State from Nebraska
to be formidable foes. Ireally don’t
know much about the team from
Australia."

After struggling to rebuild
Grinnell‘s program, which was mired
in a 25-year losing streak, Coach
Arseneault turned to the running
game five seasons ago. During the
past three seasons the Pioneers have
compiled a 44-23 record.

Last year Grinnell won the Midwest
Conference crown for the firs} time

since 1962. “The success we've had
with this system has been a plensnni
surprise, i knew we were on to snme
thing good but I didn't think we’d
be this competitive," snidArscnault.

"lite Grinnell cagers hope to bccomc
the ﬁrst team at any level in NCAA
history to lead the nation in scoring
and three-pomt shooting for tour.
successwe seasons. “This Will be the
tell~talc year. We will not have the
nation‘s leading scorer in Steve
Dickmann or Ed Brands to carry the
load. What we have is balance and
depth. We're a solid 15 deep which
plays to thc system perfectly,” ex-
plained the coach

Grinnell employs a fullrcouri game
on both offense and defense. Coach
Arscncault uses 15 players in three
different shifts of five, much like
hockey.

There are 12 Pioneers who saw Slgr
nificanl action in last year’s 17-8
campaign. Coach Arseneault has
evenly distributed the talent among
the three groups.

Senior Clayton Kancshiro, adefene
sivc specialist last year, will have free
reign as the point guard on one plzr
toon. Last season he averaged 8.4
points and 1.5 assists. Junior shoot-
lng guard Scott Wilson heads up the
second group. Wilson averaged 9.7
points per game last year, including
47 threerpoint makes. Sophomore

Mad Ducks poised to _make .
waves in MWC this season

BY ERIC RIENSCHE
Sports Information

Entering her second year as head
coach of the Grinnell College
women‘s swim team, Coach Erin
Hurley is approaching this season
with guarded optimism. “We are
deﬁnitely stronger than last year," re»
marked Hurley. “We have more
depth, more talent, and more prepa
ration on our side. At the same time
we have a lot of inexperienced swim-
mers and we have a lot of people who
are still trying to settle into their
races."

After finishing a respectable third
in the Midwest Conference standings
last year, her squad is poised to con-
tinue the legacy of elite Grinnell
swimming programs, The Grinnell

18 conference crowns.

The Pioneers begin their season this
weekend with a pair of home cone
tests at the Physical Education Comr
plex pool, Tonight at 6:30 pm
Grinnell meets Washington Univer-
sity of St, Louis for a dual. Tomor-
row the team will host the Gleysleen
Relays, the ﬁrst mulli-team tourna-
ment of the season.

Last yearihe squad struggled in the
dual but bounced back to earn seer
ond in the Gleysteen Relays. This
year. however. the Pioneers look to
make an early surge and continue on
that path.

“We should be more competitive in
these early meets than we were last
season," said Coach Hurley. “While
our conditioning is not quite where

we want it to be, our technical form
is much farther along." ’

Coach Hurley’s squad has grOWn
considerably. This year's roster in-
cludes 16 firstrycar swimmers.
Hurley is counting on the leadership
of 'senior tri-captains, Morgen
‘Cheshirc, Natasha Vasey and
Melanie Wyder, to pull the team to-
gethcr and keep the Pioneers headed
in the right direction.

“Our captains should make a huge
difference in getting us offto agood
start," commented Coach Hurley.

Armed with a lot of potential and
even more deSlre, the Pioneer women
are hoping to make a lasting impres»
sion this weekend in their home pool.
The Pioneers seek good perfor-
mances and rousing fan support as
they kick off the season.
