Dee Dee the dog and other
officials discuss fire safety

By SCOTT ANDERSON
Staff Wri|er

SUALLY, fire safety lessons
are dull and boring. Luck
ily, Grinnell College’s idea

of ﬁre safety is different than the
normal routine,

Dave Thompson and his side-
kick Dee Dee the dog talked to
Grinnell students living in the dorms
about ﬁre safety during study breaks
this past week. Dee Dee the dog
performed safetyrrelated tricks dur-
ing Thompson’s presentation. Dee
Dee showed students how to “stop,
drop and roll," among other tricks,

Studean also watched a short
safety video and practiced using a
fire extinguisher on small ﬁres.

During the study break, students
learned the location of fire exits in
their dorms and one person for each
floor was appointed to make sure
everyone got out safely in the event
of a fire.

The fire department also gave
tips on how to avoid fires in the
dorms. To avoid ﬁres, all stoves
should be turned off and candles and

other burning objects should always
be extinguished before leavtng the
room. Extension cords should also
beehecked to make sure that they are
not overloaded with too many high
powered items like refrigerators and
stereos.

Cleveland Hall experienced a fire
three years ago started by candles.

Custodians honored during
Appreciation Week

By RIVA SHARPLES
News Editor

ESTERDAY, in honorofNa
tional Housekeeper
Appreciation Week, custo-

diansatGrinneIlCollegewererecog-
nized with door decorations, words
of thanks from students and small
gifts.

It was the first time that the my
tire campus had set aside a day for
honoring housekeepers, according to
eventorganizcherald Kral, the Hall
Social Coordinator in Rawson.

”The underlying assumption [of
the appreciation day] was that these
aren’tfunjobsat all," saidKral. “But
they do deserve as much respect as
any other job. Even ifshc docs clean
toilets, we need to respect her."

When custodians came to work
yesterday morning,most were greeted
with decorated custodial closeLs and
signs of appreciation, Kral said.

Many dorms had study breaks
Wednesday night at which decora-
tions and posters of thanks were made.

"Inmydorm,wehungupabunch
of signs that said, ‘Thanks forclean-
ing the mirror’ or ‘Thanks for clean
ing the steps.‘ and put them every-
where where she would see them,"
Kral said.

Each dorm decided individually
about what to do for its custodian.
Some dorms gave gift certificates or
flowers to their housekeepers.

“Lynn Innis, the custodian in
Smith, gota$24 giftcertificate from
the Chamber of Commerce, which
can be used at any participating
Grinnell business,“ Kral said.

Others received gift certificates
toPagliai’sorballoonbouquctsfrom
Bates Flowers.

Though Kral doesn'l know if
Housekeeper Appreciation Day is
goingtobeanannualeventatGrinnell
College, he was positive about the
outcome of this year's event.

“I was really surprised about the
number ofkids who stopped the cus-
todian and said thanks to her. That
was really nice."
