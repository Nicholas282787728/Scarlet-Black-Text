The Board of Trustees will re—
turn to campus next Thursday for
theannualbudgetapproval meeting.
The agenda will include the com-
prehensive fees for 1991-92, fac-
ulty salaries and departmental op-
erating budgets.

According to President George
Drake, this year's evaluation of the
budget will be more difficult be-
cause of the substantial $200,000
decrease in endowment income.
The national economic recession
will also help to create a more fi-
nancially-stringent future forGrin-
ncll and colleges across the coun
try. “Grinnell is not alone," said
Drakcr “Some institutions are cut-
ting their present budget." The
1990‘s, in turn, will See a leveling
offandcutbacks from the growth of
the 1980’s

The budget reduction will also
limit the hiring of faculty. During
the past four to ﬁve years, Grinncll
has added an average of two to

three faculty members per year.
According to Drake, Grinnell now
has approximately 128 faculty
members. “It is questionable
whetherfacultycanbeaddedin the
upcoming ycars,"Drakesaid.Staff
reductions will be probable over
the next few years as well. The
trustees will discuss the adminis
Lrativc areas which can accept po-
sition cuts as well as those depart-
ments which anticipate retiring
faculty members.

Thelimitson faculty hiring may
affect the efforts to create a
multicultural cnvtronmcnt and the
addition offacultyofcolor. “ltdefi
nitolymakesthechallcngegrcater,”
said Drake.

Other items on the agenda in-
clude the discussion of Steiner
renovations, the authorization of
the new dorm and the introduction
of PresidentreloctPamelaFerguson
to the entire Board. Ferguson will
retum to campus once a month be-
fore the next trustees moeting in

Tuition remission.
students get housing

By Sharyn Obsatz

The policy requiring ACM Tu-
ition Remission students to live of t
campus their Junior and Senior
years hashccnrepealedinadeeision
made by President Drake and his
staff. This spring, ACM students
will be allowed to go through room
draw and to live in college owned
houses.

These studentshaveparents who
are faculty members at Grinnell or
at other colleges which, along with
Grinnell, comprise the Associated
Colleges of the Midwest. They are
thus able to attend Grinncll tuition-
rree, though they still pay full room
and board.

The previous policy prohibited
these students from going through
room draw and from living in cola
legerowned houses. They Wcrconly
guaranteed campus housing for their
first two years. If they chose to live

on campus, students had to find a
place to stay for the l‘trstdays of the
semester until the college was sure
they had enough room to accomr
modatc them. Students then ran
ceivcd a room assigned to them by
the college.

The policy had been set up so
that the college could. according to
Waldo Walker, ”rceoupsomeofits
ﬁnancial loses."

Walker explained that the col-
lege had wanted to free up the space
taken by ACM Tuition Remission
students to be given to students
paying tuition.

Nevertheless, with the
Administration’s efforts to keep
college students living on campus
rather than in whatWatker referred
to as “sub-standard" housing in
town, the policy requiring certain
students to live off campus was.
according to Tom Crady, “difficult
to defend."
