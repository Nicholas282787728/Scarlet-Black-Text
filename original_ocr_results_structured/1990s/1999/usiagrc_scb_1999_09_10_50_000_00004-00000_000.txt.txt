\V'lien Netia \Vbrley looks back on her
studies at Grinnell she sees her‘science
classes as iust as important as her Art
classes in shaping her career as a painter.

"i am inspired in my work by rhe
world around me." \Vorlﬂ" said, “Biol-
og} and Asrtonomy made me understand
that world." ,

\Vhen Bt-ron \Vorley studied wood-
working under Glen Zitkle a decade later.
his Anthropology Course helped him see
different ways to look at furniture.

"1 got :i taste for others cultures." the»

younger Worley said. "in America we sit
around abigdinner table with big chairs,

but orhers culriires might think that was
. absurd."

After leaving Grtnnell borh \Y/orley's
went into careers in seemingly very difr
lEretit careers, But now Byron's furniture
rind Nerni‘s paintings are being displayed
together at rhe Grinnell Community Art
Gallery,

"The media really play offeaclt other,"
said Byron, “They're incredibly divergenr,
_\‘6( they really complement each othet."

Netia‘s work is in new media, which
she said means “I do different art work to
suit-the mood I'm in."

“This display is a collection ofmy ex
periments with painr," Neria said. Many
of the painting being displayed use ine-
tallic paints and other media less com»
mon in current art.

For Byron, the display was an opporl
tunity to integrate form and function in
a public setting, His personal philosophy
on furniture design is rhar older models
are usually better.

“I like working with older designs be
cause a design that has lasted two or three
centuries has something going for it," he

said.

He sees his display; a "celebration of
wood or n marerinl. Nineour orrcn rimcs
rlie wood is what you norice," he said.

Neun sees Byron as :is much an arrisr
as her, “The kind or hirniuire he makes
is an Art comes in many forms "

Tire display Will run until seprember
24m or the Gtilinell Community Art
Museum, 927 4m Ave. Worleys‘ work is
viewable front 3 to 5:30 Mondayrriday.

Now rhar rlie Worley's have worked
rogerlier on this exhibit, rhey hope to
work rogerlier on more protecrs,

And as Grinnell Art ocpnrrmenr Ale
urns, riiey will have a common place [(7

)it‘tiplt‘. students, And college stiil'fttr come
together through sliittctl interests.

Nineteen classes were offeictl this so
niesrer. The most popular at i-egisrrnrinn
Lisi siiriiiday were Milt i | Aria, Film mak—
ing srar tinting, Auto Mechanics, and
rlie ever»impossible-megcteintu swing
Dancing. there aie still openings in
many other courses.

Andy Nelson '00 has been riiitning
ExCo this semcstcr. One ofthe ways he
would like to improve ExCo is to get more
town residents to teach and attend classes,
He has worked ar publicizing ir, bur
townspeople don’t usually get involved
tn college events.

“I think a lot of people in town are
just inrimidared by the College," he ex—
plains. “People are actually surprised to
lieztr that they can be in ExCo."

This year more ”townics" are taking
part in ExCo. one of them is Rev. Homer
Perry, who is teaching “Telling the Sto»
ries of 87 Years" for the second time
(though it was 86 years rhe first time),

He first got involved with ExCo a few
years ago when he saw its brochure at the
Mayﬂower home and decided to take a
course. Later, after a student interviewed
him about his life story for a class, he re-
alized that “the girl was so much inter»
esred in my srory rhar it might be well ro
share it with‘others."

And so his class was born, Without
trying to draw any major conclusions, he
just presents his life as he remembers it,
in 11 sessions, scarring with his earliest
memories, and presents memorabilia
from each period.

Rev. Perry says he’s had “a lot of fun”
teaching, and has gained a better appree
ciation for students, something that
doesn’t always happen when “nowadays
it’s sitch a different wotldi" with young

.0."

Bur he's had a positive experience wnli
litht, and said "it's [good] to mix the
older people and the younger people in
whatever interests they have." So far,
laxCo has impacted students inoie than
townspeople, he said.

Craig Cooper. the owner of the local
bike shop, has a view orExco’s rown iin.
paCt similar to Rev. Perry’s, He potntsout
that many Grinnell residents don’t seem
to take advantage ofits opportunities or
even know about them. Cooper is [eacl‘iv
ing a course on bike maintenance.

Often this sort of course is expensive,
but, like all ExCo classes, this one is free.
Cooper got involved with ExCo because
someone From the college approached
hitn about it. ’

He likes getting me chance ro intere
act wtth students outside ofliis business,
and has considered raking a course him»
selfat some point, butjust hasn’t made it
a prioriry yer. ~

College srudenrs have posirive com-
inerirs abour ExCo, even if rhey haven’t
had the time to take courses themselves
“I think that the responses that any ofmy
friends have had to the classes they‘ve
taken have generally been really good,”
states Jolyon Thomas ’01.

Keri Wong ’01, who’s taken mostly
film courses and the Beach Boys course,
feels that most people haven't taken ad-
vantage of ExCo because they’ve been too
busy, but “it’s given a lot to me.”

ExCo can offer a welcome diversion
from more formal classes. Molly Backes
'02 feels it “gives you a basis in real life,
outside ofthe academic bubble.” Com-
menting on the less-than-ideal town-
gown relationship, she thinks “it’s a re-
ally good way ofbtinging rhe rown and
college together."

Dave Gtoppe ’97 and Jen sandler ’98,
the primary founders of ExCo, visited
Oberlin College to get ideas from their
Experimental College, and brought the
concept to Grinnell, where it has become
well-established.
