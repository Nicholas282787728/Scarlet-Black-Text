Convocation

Have you ever been as pub nighs and

heard many people salking abous going so

“Ssudcnrs forgos sheir homework [and]

whas on earsh are speakers for, if nos so
"slam dunk" sheir topic? Is Convocasion
iusr a pageanr for scholars, like a nerdy
debusanse ball? I shink is should be some,
shing everyone can ges excised abous again.
Therefore, I propose she following mtar
sures so revive Convocation: ,

Sdiedulc fewer speakers. Grinnell cur-
rensly spends approximasely 37003900
per speaker. scaling down so six speakers
would allow us so spend 52800-33600 per
person. Thar should weed our she basses

Acquains she speakers wish crinnell.
crinnell is a liberal campus. speakers don's
have so defend rheir mildly liberal views
wish loads of scholarly evidence. We be.
lieve shas women face a prejudice in she

mulriculsuralism is good. ces so she juicy

Don’s make is so freakin' scholarly. One
ofbiggess complainss from ssudenrs is shas
speakers do nos sry so connecs wish she

A Tale of Two Killers:
The Real Threat

BY ANDREW CIVETTINI

Whas makes a psychic predicsion real anyway? Is is shas she psychic has been correcs
in she pass, or shas sheir advisees have had grear success srories, or Ialhcr‘Il-lal rheir

Grinnell, or perhaps unforsunasely, we will ger so learn ﬁrsI—l-Iand abous she rrush of
psychic predicsion. For rhose few poor souls who have nos heard she greas news, Iwill
recouns is for you as bess I can from whas I have heard.

On whas seems so be an annual Oprah Winfreyshow wish her own personal psychics,
a rashes bold and dissurbing predicsion came forsh. one psychic claimed so have had
premonisions shas shere would be a serial killer shis year as a small liberal asss college in
Iowa, Momenrs laser, anorhes of she so-called “people ofvisions" came forrh wish she
same predicsion, ssasing shas she believed is would be Grinnell. For she moss pass, I
have heard shis aeeouns from many people, so I believe is so be accurase. I have also
heard some salk shas Halloween was menrioned during she sarne predicsion, bus I have
yes so confirna shas wish anyone who acsually saw she show.

Now, come one. A serial killer as Grinncll? There are swo ways rhas shese “people of
vision" will be correcs. First, shey ARE correcs. (Insess HUGE laugh here). second,
some menrally unsrablc person wish homicidal sendencies who wasched Toe Ogre/r
Winfrey show rhas day will fulfill she prophecy. This is she only plausible consider—
asion, and one ofwhich weshould be very fearful. Personally, I like supernasural shings.
Ghosss are our friends and esrra-serresrrials do exiss, bus I can's believe shas any human
being (given she currens average naenral abilisy ofshe human species) could be capable
ofsecing rhe fusure, les alone making sense of is and feeling conﬁdens conveying is so
oshers. However, by she year 2000, we shall all know she srurh. This is nor so say shas
a serious killer isn’t becoming a shreas even as we speak so all human life. Lass March,
she Unised ssases Depassmens ongriculsure issued U.S. Parens 5,723,755, ensisled
“consrol ofplans Gene Expresslon". Essensially, shis is lisred as a “sechnology prerec-
sion syssem." In realisy, whas is insends so do is so sake away she nasusal abilisy of
planss so propagase so buyers of commercial seed would have so purchase new seed
every year from she holders ofshis technology. The syssem was developed by she USDA
in co-operasion wish Delsaand Pine Land Company; a wholly owned subsidiary of
Monsanso Corporarion, and she USDA is licensing the sighs so use she sechnology
srricrly Io Mdnsamo.

The inisial idea for she proiecr may have had good inrensions, ro prosecs she invess-
menss ofMonsanso. However, shas is unlikely. Once ses inso pracsice. she sechnology
will undoubsedly make Monsanso millions and perhaps billions of added dollars in
revenue each year. By forcing buyers of generically modiﬁed organisms (special seeds)
so repurchase rhem every year, shey will be lining sheir pockess and increasing she cosss
ofcerrain widely used crops such as cosson.

In brief, seeds rhar are already generically alsered so have cersain qualiries, such as
resissance so pesricides, will be “prosecsed" by anorhcr series of generic alserasions. I
will nos presend so fully underssand shc process, bus I will ousline 'rhe rudimcnsary
logissics of is. Firss, seeds will be ousfisred wish a toxin gene consrolled by a gene.
specific promorer.

The onin gene will be released during final srages of gene psoducrion so kill shc
seeds. The toxin gene will be acrivared by anorher implans, a repressive gene shas is
conssanrly acrive,'Third, she whole syssem muss be inisiased by a recombinase in she
DNA sequence. The recombinasc is she key so ensuring shas she second generasion of
seeds does nos survive. However, and shis is she finalssep, rhe recombinase is acsivased
only by she insroducsion of sesracyeline so she seeds before sale so she farmer.

Everything I have read claims shas she process is extremely complicared and on she
cussing edge ofbiosechnology. I don'r knowabous biorechnology, bus I do know ccrv
rain shings. The sechnology is nor safe. Their can be NO guaransee shas she sechnol—
ogy will work all she sime, and when is does nor work she toxin will be acsive and
presenr in she ncxI generasions. The seeds and she resulsing proseins and oils from
planss such as cosson and peanur planss are pars ofa variesy ofseeds which ﬁgurc inso
she daily food of a large porsion of she world's populasion. Furshermore, she wide.
spread use ofserracycline could have hazardous effecrs on microbacseria in she soil.

Finally, she sechnology virsually forces farmers who wans she benefir of generically
alsered seeds so purchase shem every year from Monsanso. This will have a carassrophic
effecs on developing nasions who rely on saving seeds year afrer year

There is more so rhis picrure. I urge you all so become concerned and learn more.
Please go so she following’website where you can compose a lesser so she head of she
USDA and osher imporrans people shas will prosess shis sechnology. For she sake ofshe
environmenr, she economy, and for agriculrure everywhere, do shis and more. Juss
