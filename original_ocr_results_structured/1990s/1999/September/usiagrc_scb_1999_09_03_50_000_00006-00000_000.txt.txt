Benjamin Franklin once said
something to the effeet that success
ful people don't have eitpeerations.
They just go out and sueeeed, Golfer
l-liiary Minnielt said. “I never expeet
anything, but i rhinitl definitely have
aehanee at playing well at oonferenee,
and perhaps even winning it again."

Conversely. her coach. Athletie
Director Dee Fairchild maintains eit—
peetations. but they are remarkably
similar to Hilary/s non—expectations.
”Hilary.is a top—noteh golfer. I cerv
tainiy expect her to be the fronHun—
net in rhe‘league and shoot for med»
aiist honors again this fall,” coma
mented pairchiid,

Because of a back injury,
Minnick didn't play much this sum-
mer, but her game is improving daily.
Fairchild maintains that no work is
needed on l—liiatys gatne exeept, “get.
ting her out on the course and play

mg.”

Ofcourse, a returning regional
champion does not maite aream. last
year Grinnell ﬁnished aclose ﬁfth, by
‘one point, in the conference playoffs,
but should fare better this year.

One reason for expected ima
provemenr is the addition of first-
yearAshley Pausig, who Fairchild ex—
pects to shoot in the high 80s or low
90s.

“We are definitely better then
last year because of Ashley,” nored
Fairchild. “I think we can shave 20
to 30 strokes from our team score.”

For seoring in the conference
golfrournament. six golfers play, and
the best four scores are added toe
gether. The lowest point total wins
the tournament. ,

_ Fairchild expecrs to improve
upon the team’s fifth—plate ﬁnish by
one or two piaees. The points, or
lack there of, Pausig provides.coupled
with a eore ofeitperieneed returners
deﬁnitely make Grinnell's conference
hopes stronger.

Fairehild has also been pleased
with the work ethie and play of roe
turners Sarah l’ohlman, Sarah Miller.
Angela Jensen, and Nadia Manning.
All expect to improve their stores at
this weekend’s Grinnell Invitational,
the teams only home event ofrhe year.

Whether expectations are se—
mantic or not .they certainlyare for
improvement. The team should
move up acouple ofspots in the con-
ferenee hierarchy.

Battling reduced numbers and
surprising absences, the women’s ICU»

them. The W99 Grinnell women’s

The team was asurprisecham»

Beloit College in the conference ﬁ,

"The mareh was Very. very

ofstepping it up another level," said
team member Maiko Momtani.
The team returns {out out of
its top six players from last year's

missing players is Hulda Grin, who

Donahue also commented on
the teams expectations for the NCAA

make the smart plays we are becom—

‘ Said senior Jamie Snider “A bid
to the NCAAs is the ultimate goal.
This is die year. We have so much
talent and depth in every position."

With a total ofzs players the
tremendous depth which will clearly
help the team is leaving Coaeh
Sonnichsen with some very difficult
decisions to make about playing time.
“There are 18 or more kids mar could
start,” said Sonnichsen. “Managing
playing time is going to be the big
gear problem. The important thing is
that everyone on the team contriba

attitude."

Although Sonnichsen said he
would not be changing his substitute

ditional players the starting lineup
could change from day to day.

Too many good players it a new
problem for Grinnell Volleyball. Said
Donahue "When we seniors arrived
here, we inherited a program that had

It appears that they have

David Arseneault. Arsenea-ult said he
realizes that these losses makchis tearn

improved their games over the sum-
mer.

“Mailto or Christinewtil eapa.

really hurts the depth of the team,"
Arsenauit said. “We will have to win

in eonferenee play, points are
earned by winning matches at all slots.
and in years past, Grinnell won com»
petitions by earning the majority of
their points in the lower»numberecl

will be foreed to change.

Seniors Amy Kaufman and

“the returning players have really im-

A good note for the pioneers is

most ofrhe other schools in the Mid
west conference graduated their top

players. According to Arsenauir, the
conference is wide open at this point,
with no eiear favorites emerging. He
feels that a good firstyeat or transfer
could swing the balanee in the con-
ference to favor one sehool over an—
other.

The Pioneers open their season
with a home game against Cornell
college tomorrow.
