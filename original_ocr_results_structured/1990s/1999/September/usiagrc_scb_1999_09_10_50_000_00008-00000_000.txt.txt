Last yum. the Grinnell foetball offense was
like rhe guy washing rhe grime offhis Hum-
mer wnh Perrier They were rough and pol.
ished, AlleAmerican quarrerbaek Troy
Douglierry '00 ihrew ro two allsAmencan re»
eeirers for a onion—leading ouarrerbaek effi»
ciency- raring and a 10-0 record.

The dcfcllsc’s lob last year was to hold the
opposing ream ro under whar rhe offense
scored. which was usually a lot, This year the
lam“ will nccd to rely on the defense, which,
according ro Coach Greg Wallace, is like trad-
ing an ether rag for a rire iron, Eirher is a
good way ru knock someone out,

The task at hand this fall is big. The team
is ranked lsrh In rhe narion by USA Today
and 24m by Sports lllusrrared. This presenrs
a dauming rask for a much-changed group.
The defense is in rop shape, rhough, accord
ing ro all involved.

Wallace mainrains rhar rhe ream‘s srrongesr
area is rheir lineebacking' eorps. Three of rhe
four linebackers posred over so raekles Iasr
year. Tire group was led by MarrAmendr ’00,
an all-conference linebaeker who holds the
school record for sacks and is "destined ro
reaeh rhe quarrerbaek," aeeording re Brad
Ruhoff’Ol.

Ruhoff, rhe orher ourside linebacker and
also an alleonferenee player, said, “Matt and
1 eonrrol rhe ourside. our defense is crazy,
We fly ro rhe ball and are hard hirrers. We're
ready ro eonrrol rhe game unnl our offense
srarrs clreking."

Wallace agreed. “At every posirion group
on defense, we have good reruming srarrers
and some ralenred newcomers eonrnburing,"
eommenred Wallaee.

Filling our rhe hnebaeking eorps are losh
Rehmann ’00 and Perer benyo ‘00, who are
both also esrremely hard hirrers. “Those guys
make our job a lor easier by raking our any

reeeivers wirhin ren yard ofrhe line ofscnme
mags," nored safery lason kelly ,00

Kelly and freesafery Matt iohnsron ’01 Cole
lsered 71 and so raekles lasr year and aresupe
porred by vereran eornerhaeks Jason Anders
son '01 and loe Hansen ’00 in rheseeondary.
The line, which is anehored by rerurnees Wes
Prickett ’02 and Beau Hurrig '01 , helped posr
40 saeks lasr year.

The offense rhar needs ro “srarr clicking”
doesn‘r evaerly have a dead barrery, rhough.

Airhough rhe backﬁeld is a mixture of
youngand old (hraeyears Alan Mourirsen and
Adam Wallaee play railback and
runningbaek), fans can always expect
Dougherry ro have a srellar year. over rhe lasr
two seasons Dougherry has rhrown for over
6000 yards and or rouehdowns and is per.
haps rhe besr quarrerbaek in Division 111,

A quesrion rhar many ask is wherher
Dougherry will be able ro pur up such num-
bers wirh rhe loss of all.Americans David
Snider '99 and Riehard Wemer '99.

in Jeff Pedersen '02, Marr Roberts ’01 and
Andy Egan '01, he has a eapable group ofre-
eeivers. Pcdersen highlighrs rhe group, and
Wallace expects ro ger him use ball “any way
WC can."

l’cdcrscn, who is known for running over
people once he gers rhe ball, expects ro be a
ream leader on rhe field, and dominare op»
posing linebackers “the way 1 run over Ruhoff
in praeriee.” Ruhoff doesn‘r remember rhis
happening and denies ir.

Roberts has “rhe hesr hands on rhe ream“
aeeording ro Kelly, and Egan musr be ready
ro play afrer rwo years ofbaeking up Werner
and Snider.

The nanonal arrenrion afforded rhe ream
purs a rarger on rhoir baek. Wallace eom.
menred, “For rhe firsr rime since I‘ve been ar
Grinnell, we'll be a big game on every one of
our opponenrs schedules. our narional rank»
ing really has norliing ro do wirh rhe 1999
rearn, ir is just a reward for rhe accomplish-
menrs of 1998,”

This sarurday, rhe rearn playsin claremonr,
and Wallace, who enrers his 12rh season as
rhe leader of the Pioneers, expects a rough
ehallenge from rhe sraggs. “We have seen rape
ofClaremonr from rhe end oflasr season and
rhey are very srrong," he said. “1 rhink rhey
have 18 srarrers rerurning on a ream which
was comperirive in every game lasr season,
We‘ll deﬂnirely have our work our our for us
because ofrhe rravel, theircxpcricncc and try—
ing ro fill holes made in our lineup due ro
graduarion."

Hopefully rho only hole rhe ream will see
romorrow is rhs zero in rhe loss column as
rhey iry ro drive ro rhe Midwesr Champion
ship and an auromaric narional playoffberrli, ,

Hilary Minnirk remmrﬁz’r a see/radians" fending the wameri gel/franks!

By Jesse Dubow
Spoils Writer

With offers on the table to play Division I
golf ar perennial powerhouses Duke and
North Carolina, Hilary Minnick '02 chose
instead to attend Gtinnell. The logical ques-
rion many mighr ask is, why!?

The answer, simply, is rhar rhere’s more ro
Minnick than iustgolf. "Division I would take
roo mueh time, 1wanred ro do orher rhings,
and be able to focus on academics," she says.

True as her word, she has raken rhe oppor»
tunity that a small Division 111 school offers
and spread her horizons During her first year,
Minnick acted in Macbeth, and she would
like ro do some oneeaer plays rhis year. In atl—
dirion, rhis year Minniek serves as a Srudenr
Adviser on Younker 2nd. “That's going real
well. I've mer a lot ofsrudenrs, especially first-
years, and ir doesn'r really seem like a job ar
all," shc said.

What’s more, in an effort [0 become a true
Renaissance woman, Minnick commenred
rhar shervould like ro join a singing group on
eampus rhis year.

In addition to what would seem like a full
plare for anybody, Minnrck also manages ro
play golfar rhe highesr level. Last year, as a
hrsr-year, she was ranked number one in rhe
region wirh an average seore of7s. and was
well on her way ro qualifying for narionals,
but a haek injury in rhe spring put rhose as-
pirarions ro restifor now,

Coach Dee Fairchild, however, remains
eonhdenr rhar Minnick can qualify rhis year.
“lfshe plays well, it's definirely a doable goal
[(0 makc nationalsl,” Fairchild said.

Minnick has more immediate goals for rho
fall season, however. “I would like to win cone
feienee again, and also lower my average by a
stroke or two," she said, “As for tcam goals,l

hope for improvemenr." She was also quick
ro poinr our rhar “Friday we broke 400 for
rhe firsr rime ”

crinnell had two meers lasr week—includ-
ing the annual Grinnell invirarional on sar.
urday.

on Friday Minniek shor a 73 in a fourrh
plaee ﬁnish, and on Saturday she shoe an 85.
“I was nor happy w1th rhe way I played on
Saturday," she said.

The season isyoung, however, and Minniek
did nor play much golf this summer as she
was undergoing rherapy for her ailing back,
The back should nor give her any problems
rhis year, burshewill have re ger used ro wear-
ing a braeewhile playing. Minnick mainrains
rhar she iusr needs ro ger used ro the hraee
and rhar scores will nor be adversely affeered.
“1 noticed it more carrying my bags rhan i
did swinging,“ she said.

The Loeusr Valley, Long Island, narive does
nor know how far she wanrs ro rake her golf
career.

Fairchild nored rhar “Hilary can do whar.
ever she wanrs ro wirh golf—shes a talented
golfer. She has a beauriful swing and a wone
derful attitude."_

Caprain Sarah Miller .00 agreed with
Fairchild. “1r depends on' how much she wanrs
ro make golfa parr ofher life. she wanrs ro
do more rhings ar crinnell rhan iusr golf,"
Miller said.

A: ir srands now Minniek sees rhar rhere is
mueh more ro life rhan golf. Her renrarive
plan for next year is ro play for crinnell frrsr
semesrer and rhen go abroad, possibly ro
Cambridge or Oxford, in rhe spring semes-
rer.

When asked ifslre would play ar all over-
seas, she shook her head, saying, “1 wanr ro
rravel, and go for rhe experience."
