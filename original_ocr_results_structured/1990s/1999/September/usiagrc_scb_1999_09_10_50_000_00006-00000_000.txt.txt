This reason does not go inro particulars. irwe didn’t

The déiails involve splitting Darby in hair, and

I believe rhar rhis is architecturally possible, and

cont. from p. 5

Willis is a child psychologist and
he is presented with a child who
claims to see dead people. Things
don’t get creepy until the audience
actually gets to see the dead
people, too. Just thinking about it
gives me chills.

A: I also thought this ﬁlm was
quite well done. I spent all ofit in
my own chair, unlike the person
sitting next to me. I should have
gotten half off, now that I think
about it. Everyone talks about the
twist ending, but I thought the
most striking aspect was the little
boy. He seemed to command
every scene he was in, and that’s
no easy task with action god Bruce
Willis trying to get dramatic.

C: I agree with you, but I
thought the surprise ending was
fantastic. I‘m so glad that I hadn’t
heard about it before like I had
heard all about Blair Witch. Look
closely at the real skinny guy in
the beginning — that is good ole
Donny Wahlberg looking pretty
hideous.

A: It helps to have not heard
about it, definitely. Definitely
creepy. Not gory, just creepy.
Seems Hollywood is getting back
to that. Probably some Scream
backlash.
