and a conrroversial pan-game ending.

\With a 2-1 vicrory over Beloir on
Tuesday, and a biutte 1-0 win over
Monmoum on Saturday, rhe Pioneers

and Danny Cochrane ’03.

That's when rhings gor ugly.

In an uncharacteristic defensive
lapse, Grinnell allowed Monmourh ro
ger deep inro rhe defensive rhird.
Monmouth’s attack resulted in an ac—
robatic header into the back of the
ner. Fortunately for rhe Pioneers, the
goal was waved off by ofﬁcials who
concluded that the Scots‘ scorer was
offsides.

Monmourh wasn'r convinced: rhey
rhoughrrhar rhe goal had heen waved
oifhecause rirne had expired. The hall
was in the air when the horn sounded,

rompers ﬂared and words were ex-

changed, Afrer rhe siruarion was re-
srored ro some order, the dehare con-
rinued, hur the resulrs stood: crinncll

Monmourh didn't rouch the hall un-
ril arrer relkey's goal,” explained
Wood,“aurpassingdunngrlrarsrinr

rhings we did,"

Narhan Quance ’01 agreed, hur
added, “We're srlll nor raking advan-
rage of our chanoes.”

The Pioneers ourshor Monmourh
