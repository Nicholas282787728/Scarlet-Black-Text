These programs are orren
a primary food source for low

and rhe need has never been so high.

According ro Habitat for Humanity publierry eoordrnaror

ing," said Lingo,

Last year PAN and Habirar raised over $200, which rhey
donared ro The carholic Worker, a shelrer and supporr eenrer in

tions will be collected in boxes at the sleep out, which will take
place from noon on Nov. 17 unril noon on Nov. 18.

Nov. 15, before the speakers’ presentation. Donations will be
accepted, but dinner will be free.

Parricipanrs will be given a ricker rhar corresponds ro one of
rhree classes: lower, middle and upper. Lower class rickers will
eat rice and beans, middle class tickets will get a pizza dinner
donared by local businesses and upper class riekers will relieve a
multi-coursv: dinner

The tickets will be distributed according to national income
trends to symbolize the inequitable distribution ofwealrh in the
