CDO: Time for Seniors
to look forjobs is now

By Erik Gable
Staff Writer

For seniors approaching their ﬁnal
semester at Grinnell, looking for a job
probably takes a back seat to the slew oi
papers and exams due immediately. But
according to Steve Langerud, director
orthe career Development Office, the
time to begin the job search is now

The ﬁrst mistake most seniors make
in looking for employment after gradur
ation, Langerud said, “is not starting

_ early enough.” Seniors should be try»
ing to narrow down their search, ﬁgur.
ing out not only what they want to do
but where they want to be geographi-
cally. ,

TheemploymentchoicesofGrinncll
graduates are difﬁcult to characterize.
“If we look very broadly at the senior
classes over the last few years," langerud
said, we Find that about a third of
Grinnell students go to work immedi—
ately after graduation. Another third go
on to graduate school, and the ﬁnal third
engage in other activities, pursuing fel—
lowships or working with groups like
Americorps.

Graduates who enter the work force
and up in a variety of ﬁeld, Langerud
said. Many Gtinncll students are inter-
ested in the publishing and writing
ﬁelds. Government iobs, teaching, and
public service are also popular.

some students also choose to go
abroad after graduation. Langctud cited
the example oionc student who stud.
ied abroad in Indonesia during his time
at Gtinnell, and now lives and works
there as a journalist.

Right now, Langerud said, large
companies in areas such as ﬁnance and
banking are aggressively recruiting stu—
dents. These companies often like to
have their positions filled before the end
orthe year.

Graduate school ﬁgures prominently
in the plans of many students, even
those planning on getting a job imme-
diately after leaving Grinncll. “Within
ﬁve years oigtaduation, between 75 and
80 percent of alums report that they’ll
be back in graduate school," Langctud
said,

Getting a late start isn’t the only
problem facingjobrhunters, Onccom-

mon characteristic of Grinnellians,
Langerud said, is that “they like too
many things. and they're good at too
many things." When it comes to dc-
cide on a career, it’s dirﬁcult (or many
people to choose iust one.

Langerud said the key is for students
to shift the way they look at their job
options “were socialized to work from
lists," hesaid, But usually, students can
ﬁnd a way to put all their interests [04
gether, and perhaps more importantly,
ﬁnd a way to get paid for it

otherwise, he said, “they end up
doing something by default that they
don’t care about that much."

The CD0 has a number oicontacts
to help students ﬁnd work, ranging from
corporations interested in hiring
Grinnell graduates to alumni who want
to help out.

”Helping students connect with als
mm is very important," Langerud said.
Alumni will olten write to the college
with jobs for which thcyd like to hire a
crinncll graduate. They can also serve
as mentors for students who would like
to follow a similar career path.

in addition, over so recruiters from
companies have come to campus to
meet with Grinnell students over the

'course 'ofthc fall.

langerud wants to make sure stu;
dents know diat “we’re here to help you
be more successhil, in your time at the
school and in leaving Grinnell." The
CD0 recently moved ﬁom Meats Col-
tage to a new ol-‘ﬁce at 1227 Park street,
alongside the oﬁﬁee ofSoclal Commit—
ment. langerud said the new location
is closer to both academic buildings and
residence halls, which should make it
easier for students to get to.

There are two people new to the oﬁ
ﬁce who seniors should get to know,
tangerud added. Joyce stern, a Grinnell
alumna, is the CDO’s new Assistant
Director, ”shes putting a lot oitrme
into working with seniors," Langerud
said.

Doug Cutchins, another alumnus,
heads dre oiﬁcc orsocial commitment.

langcrud estimated that between 85
and 95 percent or the senior class will
use the coo this year in their search
for employment alter Grinnell.

week now comes to us
courtesy or iohn
Dickmann, a middle
school teacher and mom-
ber of the Oklahoma
state Textbook Commit
tee, Dickmann intro-
duced the disclaimer to
committee members aﬁer
they had rejected every
blologylcxlbooksubmltr
red for their review,

In other words, they
could ﬁnd no textbook
that disputed evolution.
and from this, naturally,
they concluded that the
theory was controversial.

“Some or us on the
committee wanted to
send a strong statement to
the publishers that we are
fed up with textbooks
that only present one side
or the story," Dickmana
told the Tali/l wot/d. “I‘m
not just picking on sci.
ence, either. I have cons
ccrns in other subjects,
[00.“

I couldn't agree more.
That's whyl have decided
to help our committee
member Dickmann and
his colleagues by suggests
ing some disclaimers that
could prerace textbooks
on other subjects with

which they may have con-
cerns.

American history:

This textbook dis.
cusses the civil War, a
controversial event that
some historians present as
an explanation for why so
many living things, such
as humans, stopped living
between 1861 and 1865.
No one living now was
present when this sec
called “civil" war allegedly
took place. Therefore, any
statement about why ev.
eryonc in "cone with the
Wind" is so distressed
should be blamed on poor
screenwriting,

English:

This textbook dis-
cusses gtammar, a Contra»
versial idea that some
graiumarians present as a
way to enable precise
communication among
living things, particularly
humans. No one was
present when language
ﬁrst appeared on Earth.
Therefore, any statement
about rules of language
should beconsidcredsugr
gestions, not guidelines.

Political science:

This textbook dis
cusses the First Amends

Column: School subjects need a disclaimer

ment, a controversial bit
or the constitution that
some political scientists
present as a restriction on
the state‘s ability to dabble
in religion. No one living
now was around when
this Godless claprtap was
written. Therefore, it
might not have been
meant to apply to reli-
gious objections when
they are poorly disguised
as disagrccmenton scien-
trﬁc grounds.

Geology:

This textbook dis.
cusses scismology, a cone
trovcrsial theory which
some scientists present as
scientiﬁc explanation for
the quaking or the Earth
that occurs along fault
lines. No one has been
inside the earth's crust to
witnessthtshirtingortec—
tonic plates. Therefore,
we can assume this rumc
blingofthe earth is God’s
way of punishing the in
ﬁdels.
