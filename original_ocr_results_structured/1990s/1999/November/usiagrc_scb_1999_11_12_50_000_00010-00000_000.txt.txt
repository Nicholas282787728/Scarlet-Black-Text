Madness Campaign Sparks Controversy

What" is this madness?

By Mali Lorenz

l'm all for satitc as well as random humor. bui i
don’t rhink rhese ubiquitous “Stop rhe Madness; End
Polirical Activism Now" signs are Funny. They are an
asinine wasre of paper I suppose some kids are being
enrerrained somehow hy rhem, bur rhey really did
anger me, l suppose ir is beeause I pur quite a bir of
efforr inro polirieal aerivism and learning more. So,
I'm not naive about it. Not am I sansitivc about it.

i felr rhe signs were offensive and mean-spirired.
is was almosr as if iheir erearors need somerhing ro
validare a eomplaeenr lack of polirieal involvemenr,
ro make fun of it so ihar rhey don't have re eonsider
irs role seriously In reply ro rhe dismissive eynieism
behind rhis supposed humor, I’d like ro poinr out rhar
many eampaigns may seem fruiiless, bur rhey aren'i.
How about the Civil Rights Movement? Feminism’
Ending aparrheidz Realizing rhar rhere really is a hole
in the ozone? These movemenrs were all prerry “ouie
thcte” bask in rhe day.

sueh a eheap moekery of polirieal aerivism is im»
maiure and disrespeeriul of all rhe hatdrwon gains in
social aeiivism. Furrhermore, rhis kind ofmoekery un-
neeessarily diseourages so many people who really are
doing good siuff. You’re free nor to eare abour some
human ghts aerivisr being rorrured so far away sinee
you can't hear his cries, but don't expeer rhose who do
eare so just be able ro brush ii offas a joke. i suppose
thetc'll always be misdireered people, who see some.
one like me as a rhineskinned, unrealisrie radieal.
They’re shaping the eonrexr in whieh l wrire this,

lneidenially, rhe signs seem so be in rhe same spirir
as a comment eard I saw in Quad rhar said somerhing
like, “Keep rhar rempeh and roiu shit over ar rhe vee
gan souree where it belongs, away from rhe real food,"
FirSt ofall, rhere is no need ro be rude roleanerre, rhe
kind, hardworking, Quad lady. Second, it is nor
funny ar leasi I didn’t rhink so. Third, donr make
vegan food an “oiherf soy produeis are'grear even if
you're a Midwesrern beeflover; ask ilie Soy Sisrers ar
Grinnelrs rofu Factory You are just being ignoranr if
you auromarieally assume soy is weirder rhan beeriusr
beeause you’re not used to ir. People make fun of
vegans, who aren’t even very militant ar Grinnell, and
label rhem as some trail eraekpors. we iusr like good
food. That’s why I eall myselfa vegan ally.

Back to my main ropi : Those signs irriraie me
so much rhar l rip them down and erumple rhem
up without even reeyeling them, see rhe parh of
desrruerion ihey leave? And now l just wasred all

abour rhe senrimenis behind rhe signs and I would
like ro know who did ii.

Campus activism: know when to say when
By Dan Rothschild

This week, a rash ofsigns saying “Stop ihe madness!"
and urging an immediaie end in polirieal aerivisrn on earn.
pus were posred around Grinnell. Whoever posred rliese
signs, while unforiunarely not having rhe personal inreg.
tity ro rake publieowrrership ofhis or her ideas, does raise
some valid poinrs. Are we following eaeli orher and nor
rhiiiking for ourselves? is aerivism really an expression of
inward, whiie, liberal guilt? Has polirieal aerivism on this
eampus gone roo far= Ari absolure afﬁrmative or negaiive
ro any ofrhese ouesrions is a gross oversiinplifiearion of
an issue,

Perhaps rlie mosr valid poini raised by rhe anri.
activism activist is that “activism” often means no mote
ihan signing a pee
ririon or working
{or an issue exam
ined only ihrough
a left-wing sranee
The Mayor of
Eddyville in his ler-
ier ro rhis newspar
per published lasr
week raised valid
poinrs, nor only
ahoui ihe iar.roo-orren one.sided and highly biased
news reporring by rhis newspaper’s sraff, bur about rhe
ieadeney ofmany Gtinncllians ro fall in like leir.wing
dirroheads (remember Rush Limbaugh?) and sign any
peririon pur in from ofrhem. How many people sign-
ing rhe Eddyville Dunes peririon knew borh sides of
rhe issue.> No issue is ever anaesided, and no sranee
ean ever be raken wirhour seeing rhe quesiion from
borh sides. I do nor mean ro impugn that rhe organiz-
ers of rhis petition and letter-writing drive are in any
way malevolenr or eonspirarorial, I do, however, mean
ro srare rhai many ofrhe Grinnellians who signed on
ro rhis “activism" never knew the orher side of rho is.
sue, nor did rhey care ro research is.

So have we gone roo farwiih our activism? i would
venture to say rhar rhe leaders have not gone too Fat; it
is rhe followers who have ereared a problem. Too many

people, on college eampuses everywhere, will adopr any .

rions. These “cause whores" are rhe ones who give poe
lirieal aerivism a bad name, Aeiivism should he instie
gared by persons edueared on borh sides of rhe issue
who have a hearrfeli eommirmenr ro erearing posiuve
ehange. Activism done simply for ariorher issue whieh
firs a broad, left-wing party line breeds ideologues And
make no misiake abdur ir- ideologues on rhe lefr are
iusr as dangerous as ideologues on rhe tight, Both are
insranees where a world view has been deiermined by
prineiples which are by and large inﬂexible and in-
elasrie. These do not allow for opinions to he made on
ihe substantive merirs ofeaeh eaiise; opinions are held

would submir rliar we are iriielligeni enough people
ro make deeisions about individual eaiises, and nor
have in look lo a parry line philosophy ro rell iiswhar
ro believe.

So are aerivisrs just expressing a repressed, liberal,
whire guilt? Ler’s nor kid nulsclvcs: ihe cririnell body
polirie eonsisis largely ofwhiie kids from uppere
middloelass families, many ofwhom feel some de.
gree ofguilr for having some from privileged haek—
grounds siieli a response is human. Corrainly some
people, espeeially rhose based in an aerossaheboard
lefrisr ideology, are working our some ofihese prob
lems. I would siibmir, however, rhar mosi Griiinellians

who are aeiive are
as such beeause of
a beliefinaeause.
\vherher rhar be.
liei is based in a
solid eduearion of
all sides ofihe is»
sue has already
been addressed
But wharever
rheir morivarions,
ir seems rhar niosr Grinnell s'rudenis believe in whai
they are doing. Please nore, however, that signing a
peririon is nor aeiivism, any more rhan rying one'sshoe
is ”antiettipping" aerivisrri. It is rhe peririou-signing
aerivisis who are most likely to allow an ideology ro
inrerfere wirh rhe ability ro obieerively look ar an is-
sue,

so, fundamenrally, has polirieal activism on rhis
campus gone too fat? This is a prerry subieerive poinr.
and one whieh ean nor be generalized. By and large,
rhough, ii seems that there is too much aerivism for
rhe wrong reasons and roo lirrle activ|sm fot rhe righr
ones. Thar is re say rhar rhere are roo many people
working for eauses (and merely signing peiirioas)
whieh rhey have not suine-ienrly researehed. Likewise,
rhere is always room for more people aeiing as muck.
rakers, bringing ro lighr ihe rhings abour soeiery whieh
need eh‘anging. And make no misrake, most Ameri

rhe Civil Rights movemenr, have srarred wirh a small
group of people wirhour inordinare seeial power rrye
ing ro ehange rhe world. And ofren rimes, ihey did
iusi that.

The person who posred ihe signs in question
perhaps raises a valid poinr. lfhe or she would like
ro defend his or her poinrs in rhis newspaper, he or
she is more ihan weleome ro wrire a guesr column,
Email me (tothschl@gtinnell.cdu) and we ean per.
