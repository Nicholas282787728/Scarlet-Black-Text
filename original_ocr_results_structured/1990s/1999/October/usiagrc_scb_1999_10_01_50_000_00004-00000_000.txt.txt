KDIC Back On the Air

By Diane Williamson
Staff Writer

once again, KDIC is up and
running, but this is not the same
old station you may be expecting.
KDIC has implemented many
changes this year in their Continu-
ingattentpt to expandand improve
the station,

At the beginning ofthc year, the
studio was revamped with a new
sound board, two new CD players
and microphones. stella Tran '00,
the station manager, has been Co-
ordinating the equipment installa.
tion with a systems engineer from
Cedar Rapids. The Cquipmcnt has
increased the quality ofthe station's
signal, making the music much
more clear.

This year the station has also
adopted a new music rotation sys—
tem for their variety shows. Another
advantage ofthis new system is that
it improved the station's relation.
ship the College Music Journal and
the record labels who supply the
new music. Tran explains, “The
rotation system gives us a more at»
curate relationship with CM] and
record labels; when we chart, we tell
them what new songs are being
played, and this will be based on
the rotation system as opposed to
making things up."

Tran describes the decision of
the record label to distribute to the
chattsasa “vicious Circle.” she tee
ognlzes that the new system is also

more honsr: “When an artist signs
with a label, they sign a contract

that a portion oftheit royalties will
be taken out to pay for these pro-
motional CDs that radio stations
like KDIC get for free. We are (ry7
ing to be fair to the artists are well
as strengthening outstation "
KDIC receives free demos of

new music from five different
genres;RPM-electronica/(echno,
punk/ska/hardcore, world, jazz, and
urban/hiphop— from various :07
operating labels, At this point, the
stations five format managers re.
view the CDs and decide how rte.
quently songs should be played.
Heavy, medium, and light rotations
entail six, tour and three times daily,
respectively,

According to Tran the new sys-
tem has some definite advantages:
“people can tune into KDIC for a
majority ofthe time we are on the
air and be guaranteed to hear a
wider variety ofmuslc, as opposed
to punk rock for two hours
straight."

lauta Makinen '02, who hears
“Happiness Revised” along with
Karen l<inslow '02, compares her
experiences with a mtiety show last
year to the effects orthe new rota-
tion system. “The negative isthat
i think it is a lot orsongs for them
to ask [me to play]. But last year
we didn’t play a lot of new music
becaiise I didn’t know the songs on
the CDs, but nowl’ll Just throw on
a CD and listen to it.“

For Makinen, one of the ben-
efits ofcollcgc radio is its ability to
expose its audience to new and old
music that is outside of the maln7
stream, Sllccxplains, “Radiowher:
I’m from sucks, it’s really hard to
find good music,” Makinen teal.
ices that most people do not have
time to he constantly expanding
their music base, and for this tea.
son praises the rotation system.
“[KDIC] is so awesome because it
gives you access into the music
world filtered through people who
already know about and care about
music."

You Hold the Talking

Well, this weekend
we really can’t com—
plain too much about
the Films Committee.
They are bringing two
decent ﬁlms in. This
will not do. We refuse
to write an opening
paragraph without
somederision directed
towards sea, Arid
Courtney hates it
when she can't whine
about something. so,
in order to fulﬁll our
mantra of derision.
we'll remark that the
Films Committee
seems to have a thing
for British films this
semester. What about
great American works,
like “Mystery Men"
