more Dalton Kidd, 20, never
expected Iowa City police of—
ﬁccrs to conﬁscate his false ID
after he was caught carrying a
caseofbcer thathad been pur-
chased by a 21-year-old friend.

Kidd's friend had bought
the beer at a convenience store
and had given it to Kidd to
carry.

when he walked away
from the store, Kidd hesitated
when he heard someone yell,
"Hey, stop," from behind but
kept walking when he saw two
men wearing jeans.

After catching up to Kiddr
the two men pulled out ﬂash»
lights and identified them
selves as undetcover Iowa City
police ofﬁcers.

“They parted me down
because they said I was trying
to run," Kidd said, which IS
when they searched his wallet
and found his fake ID.

But users of false identiﬁ»
cation are not the only ones
harmed when they are caught

Colorado State moves to ban

smoking in, near dorms

By Maria Sanchez—Trayno
(U-WIRE) FORT COLLINS, Colo. --
smoke was rising ftom the ASCSU senate
chambers at Colorado state University on
Monday night. The heated issue ofwhcthcr or
not smoking should he 'allowed in residence
halls was discussed.

The Residence Hall Association passed a
resolution that stated that smoking should be
banned from the residence halls and that the
distance students who do smoke must stand
should be determined by Housing services It
is expected that ifHousing Services does agree
with this resolution, there will be accommo»
dations made for the smokcrs, such as some
sort ofa covered and lighted area.

This resolution will be a recommendation
to to Housing Services. It is then up to them
to ultimately determine whether or not to ale
low smoking in the dorms,

“We take (the recommendation of the
RHA) very seriously, " said David McKaItFrcsl'l,
director ofhousing, "They rte a recognized stu.
dent group and it‘s important that we Icing»
nizc their voice.“

The resolution began when Jacob Hoffman,
president of the Residence Hall Association,
proposed a resolution that asked that smoking
be banned from the residence halls and that
those who do smoke should have to stand 50
feet away from the halls.

Before the meeting Hoffman said, "i do not
want the resolution to pass as it is. It's not so
much that people havea problem ofnotsmok-
ing in the halls, but they don't like the rule
saying that they have to be... feet away."

"I don't care if the dorms get smoke.frce,
but I have a problem with the soefcct thing,"
said Shannon Lynhagen a freshman English
education major. "It's pretty ridiculous."

With the 50 feet debate, there were many
issues brought up in opposition.

Some ofthese issues included the safety of
the residents, how the rule would be enforced
and the rights ofrhe smokers.

"As American citizens being [at least] 18-
yearstold, we have the Codtglvcn right to
smokc,” saitl RHAsenator Joe Marshall, "Who
are we to say that you have to live in this place,
but you can‘t smoke lhcrc?"

In opposition, Greg Smith, Ri-LA senator
said, “we also have the Godtglvcn tight not to
smoke. And I shouldn‘t have to walk through
a doorway where people smoke."

The resolution wasamerrded, and the ﬁfty—
footerulc was stricken. It was left up to hous-
ing to determine how far away students who
smoke should stand.

"Many people say that they're not taking
away people's right to smokc, when in fact,
they're just slowly legislating and restricting it
away," said RHA senator Alcr Zicrotht

and Social security number
over the radio, he said.

Kidd said he had used his
computengenerated fake ID
for approximately a year but
hadn't used it recently for fear
oflosing it. He said most bar

looked at it and let him in

Harvard study: lvies

Though steadily—rising
college tuition is most ap»
parent at [Op»(icr schools, a
recent study by a Harvard
University economics proe
fessor suggests that these
colleges and universities are
worth the price.

Professor Caroline
Hoxby‘s study concludes
that sacrificing the extra
cash to attend a "rank one“
school ,, those with the
highest selectivity .. rather
than a state school, is Justie
ﬁed in the long run.

”One of the things
people often don‘t appreci»

that they oﬁcr more ﬁnan-

When underage people are
caught with false identificat
tion, they are ﬁned $145 on
the first offense and $200 on
the second offense, combined
with 30 days ofdriver's license
suspension, Lord said.

“The person showing the
ID should get charged more

wrist,” said Moore, Complaint
ing that the penalties for the
deceived staffare more severe.

“We’ve got to take it seri—
ously," he said. “it's our ﬁrst
line of defense. our (liquor)
license depends upon us fol.
lowing the rules."

penalties for businesses on
the first oftense for accepting
a false ID include a $500 ﬁne
for the employee and up to
$1,500 for the owner, or a14-
day liquor license suspension.
The second offense mcans a
$1,500 ﬁne for hoth parties
and a 30412)! suspension; the
third offense results in the
double ﬁne, a 60-day suspcnt

The costs of the
University's ﬁnancial aid ini-

penses, will continue to push
University tuition higher. This

last year, and Provost Jeremiah

continued rise indeﬁnitely.

Increasing salaries drive
niition costs steadily upward
even though the rising endow—

students, 0stiker said. The

Beginning in January

make more revisions to the li-
censes issued in 2000, which
will help owners identify un-

Lewis, the DOT investigator.
