The People’s Elbow
Questions abound about master plan

rhe overwhelming majoriry of eoneerns are abour rhe
newly unveiled "masrer plan” to radically alrrr Crinnell

“How can We possibly afford all these build-
ings; are Osgood and the Trustees playing with
Monopoly money or something”.> _ Randy,
Loose

Eirsr ofall, you'v: obviously been brainwashed byTonr
Crady and SGA and rheir “budgers,” Don'r ler anyrhing
Osgood or rheTrusrees say abour money fool you. Grinncll
has more money rhun every college exeepi Yale and
Harvard Over a billion dollars. Think about that. Of
course the thing is that most or that wealth has been ace
crued for us by Warrcn Buffctt in the mid to latc»ninc-
ries which explains why we still have hideous buildings
like Burling and Norris. The masrer plan does nor exist
wirhour all rhar money

“Are these improvements really necessary?
Why can’t we just be happy the way things are
and donate our vast wealth to charity?” —

Davidr Cleveland

Alrhough Grinncll has boasred being a “liberal arrs
college of rlre firsr rank," rlre faer remains rhar many of
our faeiliries are nor even worrh being ranked ar all. The
biggesr problem rhe eamprrs eurrenrly has is housing, and
frankly rhe band—aid put on rhis problem several years
ago (Norris) is wearing rhin and rhe bleeding has srarred
like never before. The masrer plan will rhrow rhe ban»
dage in rhe garbage (parking lot), and build a desperately»
needed “Easr Campus" which inrglrr finally fulfill srudenr
housing needs enough so rhar Sreve Larson ean rake a
vacation some April.

The orher rhing is rhar eompared to omersehools some
ofour buildings are ineredibly rnepr and ourdared. The
Forum is rhe biggesr example of rhis. This srruerure was
deemed insufﬁcientapproxlmzltcly ren seconds afrer ir was
eomplered, and doesn’t even come close ro rhe quality of
srudenr garhering eenrers ar sehools like Carleron or sr.
Olaf. oh, and you ran be guaranreed rhar one rhing ihe
rrusrees like abour rhe new srudenr eenrer is rlrar rhey can
ﬁnally pacify rlre whining for “mulrieulriiral space.”

“How good does this plan look on paper?”

well, rhis is quire a complex question ihar could be
analyzed ar grear lengrh. Obviously rlrar is somerhing you
won’t 5:: me do,

It needs to bc sirusscd, first of all, that this plan is
generally very sound and should solidify Grinnell for rhe
next eeniury. However, rhere are several smaller points ro
rhe plan rhar deserve eririeism, The biggesr disappoinr.

nobody listened to all thl: studcnt input which indicated

is a big building aeross rhesrreer from Cleveland and James
rermed “ofﬂcampus housing." Nor only is rhis building
barely off—campus, bur rr appears ro be approximarely five
times the size of Clcvcland. Obviously more “offrcamr
pus" (Collcgc—owncd) houses are exrremely desirable, bur
rhis looks like a dorm wirhour a loggia. Anorher puzzling
quesrion is why we need an “lnrernarionai Program Far

“What effect will East Campus have on the
Current balance between North and South?”
7 Eric, Smith.

Everyone is asking whar East Campus will be like,
who will live there, and so on. My guess would be that
the northcrnmost two dorms will rcssmblc Cuwles and
Clark in srudenr eomposrrron, anal rhe sourhernmosi rwo
dorms will be more like Younker. lr will probably have
very lirrle ehange on rhe norrh/sourh dynamic we've all
some ro know and love Ease Campus needs ro have big.
ger rooms rhouglr, rhar mueh is for srire. To be blunr, rhe
current rooms are all much too small. No matter how
good a number you draw, rhese rooms were all designed
long before any orus even enrered our mommy-bags. Back
when the Current dorms were crcatcd nobody had stc—
reos, TVs, eompurers, or vasr CD sollesrions. Nor to
meniron rhar Americans are gerring inereasingly bigger.
The average Easr Campus room needs in bigger rhan airy
double eurrenrly on eampus. Also, probably abour half
the Currant doublcs Should be Inside into singles.

“How soon can we expect any of these
projects to begin?” ~John, Read

Probably not for awhile. The adminlstration is still
busy patting rhemselves on rhe heels for raking forever ro
build the new fine arts building. Qi’coul‘sc the Trustees
were quick ro poinr out rhar rhis plan is nor ser in srone
and is only valid unril 2025. Even working at a break.
