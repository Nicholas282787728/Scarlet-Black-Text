BY NICHOLAS JOHNSON
‘ Sporu Writer

The smell of freshly cut grass, the
sound of the ball hitting the careher’s
mitt, the taste of peanuts and cracker-
jack and the ping oftlie bat,

Theping ofthe bat?

Baseball piirisrs cringe at that de-
scription of the national pastime, but
they have had to live with it when it
comes to college baseball—collegiate
teams have for years been using alu—
minum alloy bats in place of the tra-
ditional wooden ones.

This year, though, many NCAA
teams, in order to comply with a
change to the rules that went into ef-
fect on January 1, have gone back to
the ash sticks their predecessors used.

Gtinnell and its fellow Midwest
Conference members are among those
teams making the Witch back,

Head baseball coach Tim
Hollibaugh explained the conference’s
decision to switch to wood bars as a
liability issue.

"[Wirh the NCAA] coming out
and saying that [aluminum bats} are a
weapon, liability wise, ifanyone gets
hurt, the coaching staff and the col-
legewould have been held liable. Based
on that information, we feel that [the
switch to wood bats] is the best thing,"
he said

Hollibaugh is referring to an
NCAA rule change that went into ef»
feet at the beginning of this year. The
change to Rule one, Section 11b of
the NCAA rules of baseball was de—
signed to protect pitchers and other
infieldets from injury due to their in-
ability to defend themselves from balls
coming offaluminum bats.

The NCAA rates bars on a length
to weight ratio. For instance, a 34-inch

long bar that weighs 29 ounces care
tied a rating of negative five.

Before the rule change went into
effect, a rating of negative five was the
set limit for bats. However, tests
showed that halls hit by negative five
bats left the bat with an average exit
speed of97 miles per hour—a speed
the NCAA deemed unsafe as it did
not allow pitchers enough time to
defend themselves in the event a ball
was hit back to them.

The new rule changed the maxir
mum eitit velocity of all bars to no
more than 94 miles per hour. Since
aluminum alloy bars that comply with
the rule change are hard to find, many
colleges have found that the only way
to comply with the new rule is to go
back to wooden bats (although the
rule says nothing speciﬁcally about the
material of which the bat must be
made).

Golf team to play at
highly competitive
tournament in
Northwest Iowa

The Grinncll College men's golf
team expects to have its best showing
thus far at the BuenaVista classic this
weekend. The Pioneers will travel to
northwest lowa this Saturday and Sun-

‘ day to face 12-16 highly competitive

sdiools.
“This is the best field we‘ll play all

‘ year," said Coach Greg Wallace.

"Many of the teams have been well

' ranked in the past few years,"

Among the leaders are Central,
Nebraska Wesleyan, Luther, Knox,
msconsindaau Claire and Gustavus

I Adolfus,

The tournament will be played at
two courses over two days. The
linksmen will play a premiere srnall

‘ ' course at the spenccr Country Club

in Spencer, the ﬁrst day, and then head
tor Storm Lake, to play a challenging

course at rhc Lake Creek Country
Club on the second day.

"This will be a great opportunity
for our top players to play against some
very good competition," said Wallace.
"1 hope we respond and play to our
fullest potential."

The Pioneers will take the entire
team to the Tw0rday event, and hope
to see better overall play One or the
goals thus far has been for continued
improvement in the four. and two
seeded players. "This tournament will
test those men. We’ll be able to set how
well we’ve made transitions,“ Corn-
mcntcd Wallace.

Last Wednesday the Pioneers ﬁn.
ishcd l5rh out of l6 teams at the
Mount Mercy College Amana Clas-
sic. st. Ambrose won the tournament
with 316, one stroke better than Loras.
The Gtinnellians shot 354.

Rookie Jared Baszler placed in the
top ten, shooting 78. Second Pioneer
was Raj sahu with at. Ben Skalland
shot 96, Ben Morgan 102 and Josh
Sexson 124.

“We couldn't take our one and
three men, so tho expectations oflhe
team changed," said Wallace. “We
were trying to focus on how each in-
dividual would play."

Although the wearhcr seemed to
bc treating the linksmen with care, the
course itselfwas wooded and hilly, and
made foran added challenge to rho re-
placemcnr players,

The immediate goal ofrhe team is
to be competitive in the Buena Vista
tournament. \Xﬁth all the players in-
tact and ready to go, the hope is for

good weather and consistent play
from the pioneers.

The d-iangehas brought mixed to.
aerions from Pioneers.

“I wasn’t real happy when i heard
that we were switching to wooden
bats," Andrew Choqucrtc '00 said,
"Aluminum batsdchriirclygivcyouan
advantage."

Michael Munoz ’99 had the same
initial reaction as Choqucttc. “When
I heard we were using wooden bats
this year, i thought it was the worst
news possible, but since the season
srarrcd I’ve come around to the nice
sound ofa wooden bat hitting a bascr
ball," he said.

The advantages Clioquerre and
Munoz were upset about losing are
varied. Aluminum hats allow batters
to hit the ball both further and better
as alloy bars have both a large “sweet
spot" that allows rot greater distance
and are much more forgiving than
their wooden counterparts.

“When we switched to the
wooden bars, we basically had to learn
to hit all over again,” Choquerre said,
“Before, you could mis-hit a ball and
it would still go somewhere. Now, if
you don't hit the ball in [he rightspot,
you end up shattering your hat and
the ball inst trickles to the ground "

Coaches have had to make adjust-
menrs for change to wood both be-
cause of the different dimensions of
the new bats and because of the bats
relatively low durability.

“because it's a heavier bat, me»
chanically you have to teach hitting a
little differently so there isn't any
wasted motion," Hollibaugh said, “so
it’s been an adjustmentt I think as the
years gone along, we've gotten better,
we’ve gotten strongeriand We've bme
ken a lot of bats."

What the Pioneers have lost in of»
fense because of the wooden bars
(home runs hit and final scores have
both taken a dive), they’vemadc up
for in defense—team ﬁelding percent»
age has increased.

Despite the advantages lost be—
cause of the switch to wood, both
Hollibaugh and Munoz said they have
grown to like the wooden bars.

“I personally like them. it defir
nitely is showing you who's a better
hitter—who’s a better baseball player,"
Hollibaugh said.

Munoz agreed. “in my opinion, 1
like using the wooden bare; it is a small
change but one that really makes you
challenge yourstlias a hitter."
