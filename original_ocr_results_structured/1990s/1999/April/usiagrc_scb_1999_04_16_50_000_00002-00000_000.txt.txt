Letters to the Editor

Dear Editor.

I'm writing in response to the newest installment ofdre GUM. On Mon»
day night I was on my way up to thc KDIC office, looking for the new
Euphonc ed (the one with Ryan Rapsys ofGaugelSky Corvair fame) and
visiting someone I had heard had the original Faith Record on red vinyl
when I decided to stop at the Northern Express. Standard. And I’m stand»
ing in Cowles, waiting, when 1 pick up the new issue ofrhe GUMt It was a
pretty standard, humcrless issue until I ﬂipped to page ten, where I ﬁnd a
show review supposedly written by me. I have never been so offended in my
life. It really hurt to see my absolute love of obscure music made fun of in a
student publication.

Just because the GUM contributors Slill think it’s cool to listen to the
Pixies (who I doubt they’d heard of until after the BBC. recordings were
OFFICIALLY released) doesn’t mean they have the right to make fun of
others.

. I liked the Pixies too, back in like 1990. Not only was the article a
personal attack on me. it was to a large degree inaccurate. The ChowMonkey—
Chow is from Boston. And the Wichita music scene is pretty standard
midwestern emo (ala Boy’s Strife, Christie’s Front Porch, Porehswing. etc.).

It's Shitnoes Teckies, not Noseturd Techiesr The #ZGLucyBuop 7 inch
was never released, and the song only came out on their “The Jeaun is the
Standard, Not So Much“ anthology rccord (sorry, it is out ofprint), lfyou'rc
going to make (un of the music I listen to, at least be well-informed about
it. I don’t know what rears me up more, your lambasting of my tastes, or
your ignorance ofundetground music. I’d like nothing more than to see the
plug pulled on the GUM, all it does is hurt people.

Sincerely,
- Philip Goudreau

' Dcar editor,

‘~ When we first started bombing Kasavo, I was on the oouch with a cold,
watching CNN. I wondered why we were bombing a sovereign nation.
Why were we bombing a country with a civil war? Why were we bombing
anyone? What had they done to us? I watched in horrid fascination as
chrisriane Amanpour (my favorite) reported blasts What in rhc hell were
we doing> As I continued watching CNN and the Fox News network, the
a’nswer startcd forming. There was this guy, Milosovic, apparently a real
jc‘rk. There were these people ofa different religion and nationality, whose
provincial power he had stripped away. Even ifivlilosovich was a nice guy,
these l<osovars did have a reason to be a little grumpy. Even so i still won-
dered why we were bombing. What did it have to do with us? Why does
America always intcrfere with other peoples business? I still had no answer.

; Two days later I went and saw Life is Beautiful", a great film. The film
happens to center mosdy around his in a concentration camp during'WWll
The emotions I felt as the main characters were taken away bccausc they
were Jewish, as the characters lived with the horrors of the Nazi regime,
made the casc for NATO bombing better than anything else could. Even
taking the most factually conservative View of the Kosovo war as i could, I
found justiﬁcation for bombing serbia. To me, keeping humans from ever
suffering anything even similar to that is worth itt It is worth the com to
Serbia, to its history, to NATo, to human life. I went back to my TV with
a whole new mindset. iwarched the video feed from thcAlbanian border as
refugees crossed it. All ofa sudden I realizcd there were few male terugccs
over 12 and under 60. Neither CNN or FOX were saying anything about
it, but I watched for a roll ten minutes and there were No MEN, Where
were they all? I watched rutthcr. Refugees were saying they had been forced
to leave (hit home at gunpoint. Too many of them had this story for me to
believe it was fiction. I watched as Serbian Tv paraded people who were
declaring all sorts of things. US soldiers, bearrn rot ‘resisting arrest. An
Australian human rights worker, explaining that he was a spy. An Albanian
Icader, declaring that he and Milosovich had reached an agreement while
his eyes furtivcly watched a point just of? the scrccn with fear. Satellite pic—
t‘urrs which show a picture strikingly similar to pictures of bosnias mass
graves of the executed. iwatchcd the ﬂood ofrcfugccs more, NO MEN.

; We donr know what is going on in Kosovo I am sure that the propae
ganda machines are going fuil- time in NATo countries and in Serbia and
everything must be taken with a grain of salt However, even suspicion of
erccuring people based on their race is enough for me. I am proud that my
country is willing to fight an unpopular war ifit'means just the chance that
they could save people from ethnic cleansing. My mothers entire family is
from Montenegro (a province of Serbia) and I know that this means my
family there might be killed. but we, as a world, have to take a stand and
never, ever Send the message that ethnic cleansing is permissible. it DOES
have something to do with all or its-and we do belong in Serbia.

" Dear Editor,

. I am writing concerning what I feel is a major flaw in our current hous-
ing system: Smoke—free room draw. The current Smokoftcc room draw situ-
ation is unjust for multiple reasons. 0nc ofthc major ilaws with this prac—
irec is the fact that Sophomorestmebe get a preference over upperclasr stu—
dents who participate in normal room draw. This is unfair because triples
and large doubles are taken away from students who should have the first
chance at these rooms, The situation is made worse because many students
who participate in Smoke—free room draw are not bothered by smoke and
simply do not care ifrhsy have to deal with smoke, they only participate in
smoke free room draw to get a better room ideally, the solution to this
problem would be to abolish smoke—tree room draw all together, except for
those students who have a medical condition which would prevent thcm
from living on a floor with a smoker. but perhaps a more moderate solution
would bc to only allow Smokeefree room drawers to pick a room before
their class. With this solution it would no longer be possible for a students
to take rooms away from other students in higher classes.

Horvit‘h '00 presents Spaces, on

DANCE experiment in performance art

BY CYNTHIA ROGALIN
Staff Writer

in me not waste space with an
introductory catch phrasc and get right
to the words ofRachel Harvith, ‘00.

"Acting fulfills something within
me that i can't ﬁnd anywhere else—
when I am away from it too long, I
feel as though some crucial part ormy
personality were being stifled. its hard
to explain," said l-latvith,

“it’s an outlet for tension, but I
think it goes beyond that, it’s very
personaleit's a way of revealing your
innermost secrets to chose you know
and complete strangers in a safe Waye
through guise oiother characters"

I-Iarvith is a junior, working on an
advanced acting project that will be
presented May 8 and 9 at 2 pm. at
the Bucksbaum Center's room l54.

Although her mother was a theater
major, l-larvith credits her interest in
acting to a more personal experience.

“My interest in acting began my
sophomore year othigh school, when
a friend ofmine encouraged me to try
our for die school play, Now, I had
always been a rather shy person around
large groups ofpcoplc. but as soon as
lstcpped up on tharstage, everything
changed. I suddenly didn't need to

worry about what other people
rhoughrethc words I was saying wcrc
not my own. but thc characrcr's."

From than, Harvrth was an ucllvc
member of her high school's drama
department, cvcn fracurringhct ankle
in tho middle of a performancc htt
senior year.

At Grinnell, slit has bccn riwolvcd
in foutmainstagc productions include
ingAﬁerrmer, Dot/r aft/75 Mum, and
this year’s productions of both 77M
Seagulland Mather/7. shc also directed
a one-act last scmcstcr cntirlcd Rid
crrsr which she reports to have “on.
joyed immeasurably."

Despite her virtual opening up on
stage in high school, ldatvtth docs
claim her family had an inilucncc on
her acting.

“,..thercprobablywassomrsubtlc
influencc from my mother‘s back
ground as a ﬁlm historian," shc said.
“When I am at home, wc are con-
stantly watching old movies."

The piece she will be performing
for her advanced project she calls
sprrrr. “it is not what you would call
a ‘playuit differs from the other three
student productions this somcsrcr in
that there is no concrete, Cntirc script
that I am dcaling with. instead, its a
eonglomcration of segments From a

“The ﬁnal pctformancc piece will be
a synthtsrs of things that I have been
working on, marnly on my own but
under rhc- guidance ofSandy Moffct,
throughout thc scntcstcr."

“Thosc have included monologrros
going from the Greeks to Shaktspcarc
to thc ptoscnt day, poems, things
winch I have writrcn mysclf, and thc
complorcly nondramatic transformed
into wharyouwould call ‘performancc

Obviously, Harvith has taken a
highly involved and personal role in
thrs project, and hcr crcativity is lead-
ing her to experiment with her acting
talents, including one scene in which
she plays both charaetcrs on stage.

sprrcr hits a particular significance
to Harvith, which is mainly why she
scltctcd it for her project.

She said, “I have come up with the
title sprrcr btcausc it is esstnrrally
about transformations. This has bccn

Newmon, Knipping to perform

BY CYNTHIA ROGALIN
Staff Writer

As the end of the semester draws
near, a certain livelincss seems to be
ﬁlling the air, looking forward to a
summer of blue skics and lazy days
without any deadlines. ofcoursc, thc
seniors don’t care much about any of
this, thc‘oniy excitement filling their
air is that of the impending gradua—

s tlon.

Two such scniots arc culminating
their careers at Grinnell in a special
stylc, rruc to themselves. Annic
Newman ‘99 and jonathan Knipping
‘99, are both giving senior recitals, per.
forming the music that has helped
them through their years at Grinnell.
“1 love singing because it's so personal,”
said Newman. “it is my body making
sound. I also like how varied voices
can sound: the same person ean sing
opera, blues, or pop and you might
never know it was the same person,”

Newman has been singing since
elementary school but only started tak-
ing private lessons upon her arrival to
Grinnell.

“Singing is a great way to get rid
of all my academic stress. it can be
challenging, but it is no different from
writing a paper,” said Newman.

Knipping has been playing the
trumpet for l0 years. ”Playing jazz
helped keep me going in college, The

singing a trio of

instrument was my mother's idea," he
said.

Both tccitals will be held tomor-
row, Aptil l7. Newman’s rn Scoring.
