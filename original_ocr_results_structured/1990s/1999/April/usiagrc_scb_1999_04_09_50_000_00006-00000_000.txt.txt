Convocation pie thrower spurs tensions; Student defends his
statements made at SGA meetings

 

Dear Editor,

some feel rhar yesrcrday's pieing of guesr speaker Dennis Avery was an
ner of cowardice. Some feel rhar ir was violenr. professor David Campbell
expresscd concern mosr originally when he called ir "il'lougl'ir-policing".

However, rhe recenr acrion, rhough more radical rhan whar many
Grinnellians seem ro be aceusromed ro, was a rool, used nor wirh cowardly
or violcnr inrenrions, bur wish a srrong desire ro ereare an inrensified dia.
logue wirhin rhis communiry.

While widely viewed as a racric used only ro disrupr an orherwise peace-
ful convocarion, rhe ramificarions ofrhe aerion extend beyond rhe conﬁnes
ofHerrick Chapel. In facr, ir oold be argued diar rhe ulrirnare inrenrion of
rhe acrion as not ro affeer rhe Convocarion audience, who by merely coming
demonsrrared rhcir inreresr in rhc issue of biorechnology, so much as ro
carry rhe dialogue ro ihose who did nor come ro Convo, eirher because rhey

did nor know or care enough abour rhe ropic in quesrion.

Regardless ofhow die acrion is viewed, ir DID spark dialogue, or leasr in
several classes rhar convened on rhursday phernoon. for rhis reason, ir can.
nor be jusrly seen as “thought—policing". I feel, moreovcrs rhar rhe oer, far
from being immarure, served. or could have served. ro break down some of
che barriers offormaliry and self-righreousness and in help us, rhrough NON-
VIOLENT humor, look beyond rhe immediare propaganda ro rhe serious,
serious issues ar hand.

Dear 55:13,

i am sure by nowyou have heard ofrhe scene rhar was ereared ar canvo»
cation

[yesrerdayl in response ro rhose inappropriare aerions, Luna Ranjir and
i, would borh like ro make a sraremenr rhar we hope you will be able in prinr
-by [roday's] edirion.

As members of rhc Rosenfield commirree, rhe group who organized die
symposium and invired che speaker and as srudenrs we would like ro con-

demn rheacrionsofrhe Grinnellian who rhrcw rhe pieonrhe speakers head. ‘

Dennis Avery is a knowledgable and well respeered professional in his
held and unforrunaiely all rhar will be remembered from his very good pre—
senrarion is rhe immarure behavior of rhis srudenr. This srudenr's acrions
reileered poorly rhe opinions and rhoughrs ofcrinnell srudcnrs, regardless
ofon which side rhey fell in rhe Bio Technology debare. Liberal rhoughr and
acrion are eerrainly encouraged ar rhis school bur in rhar freedom ro do so
we should nor close our minds ro orhers opinions regardless ofwhar rhcy
may be, lfwe dcsagree, we should be able ro say so openly and argue and
deiend our views. Physical amok (in disguise) is cowardly and irresponsible,
and under no circumsrance can ir be rreared as a joke or proresr. We feel as if
rhis srudenr owes nor only Dennis Avery a sincere apology bur rhe resr ofrhe
srudenr body and faeulryas well. We are learning ro be adulrs ar rlnis school.
unforrunarely some people have a long way ro go.

Sincerely,
Juliana Serafini and Luna Ranjlr

Dear Ediror,

Afrcr reading rhe “Lerrers ro rlic Ediror” in rhe March 19 cdirioii ofrhe
Scarlcr and black, iris clear ro nae rhar my acrions ar rhc rwo moorings held
wirh rhc adininisrrarion ro discuss rhc curren'r budger conrroversy have one
gcrcd a number ofpeople. lndccd, rlie approach I have rakcn ro addressing
rhis issue has been harshly crlrieized by my close friends, menrors, and orher
srudenrs: l have no inrenrion ofrcviewing my posirion nn rhe issue because
anybody who has been paying arrcnrion has already heard ir :ill rho argue
menrs on borh sides ofrhe issuc several rimcs. Bur ir is rlmc rhor i go on
record and dcfend my acrions.

one ofrhe main facrors rhar has conrriburcd ro rhe raciioniilizing ofrhe
campus over rhc budgcr decisions made by rhc Adminisrrarion is iuisinfore
marion, lr seems rhar many people belicvc rhar rlie Town Hall mrcring held
wirh Viceeiiresidcnr Crady and Treasurer Clay was rhe firsr umr .in inter»
course was raking place berwccn members ofrhe adminisrrarion and rncin.
bcrs of rhe srudenr body This is nor rhe case, E-mails exchanged berwecn
Presidenr Osgood and srudenrs concerning rhis issue dared several weeks
prior ro rlic meering. Members orsrudenr coveriin-ieni had been mecring
wirh Mr. Crady well before rhe dare of rho forum ro discuss rhe budger
decisions. indeed, rhe Wednesday nighr forum was a culminaring evcur ro
address concerns over rhe issue rhar had been resrering for several weeks. lr
was nor a press conference ro announce rhc decisions.

There is a pereeprion around campus rhar my acrions were unnecessar-
ily conrronrarional, so as ro suggesr rhar lwas raking rhc offensive posirion
before i knew who my enemy was. Whar many people have failed ro realize
is rhar we are on rhe defensive side ofrhe issueThc ﬁrsr move was made by
rheTrusrees when rhey decided to freeze rhe bud gcri rhis forced rhe Admin-
isrrarion ro make rhc second move by curring rwo posirions rhar are impor-
ranr ro many individual srudenrs an‘d ro sclfegovtrnancc in general.

1 will openly admir rhar l am a very passionare person. When I sense
rhar somerhing is nor rhe way is should be, l will express my concerns.
When I feel rliar somerhing is really nor rlic way ir should be, I am likely ro
express my concerns loudly and publicly. Bur 1 do nor rake ocrion wirhour
drinking firsr, While my feelings regarding rhe changing dirccrion orcrinnell,
which have been lcgirimized by Presidenr Osgood himself, have nor gar-
nered iriueh supporr From rhe srudenr body, l rhink ir is more rhan clear
rhar many members ofrhe srudenr body do nor wanr ro lose an RLC or a
Direeror orSrudenr ofAcriviries next year, Yer, rhosc who criricize my ap.
proach do nor seem ro realize rhar next year is around rhe corner We did
nor have rhe rime when rhe ﬁror forum was held and we have even less rime
now ro ger rhesc posirions back.

While mysrrideur remarks delivered or rhc firsr mccring wirli Mr, crady
and Mr. clay may have angered some people, such feelings of frusrrarion
expressed by myselfand orhers undoubredly awakened some people, borli
srudenrsand members ofrheadmlnistrarionswho had been sleeping rhrough
rhe whole rhing. People should also realize rhar my call for a walkour ar rhe
second meering rhar included Presidens Osgood allowed us ro quickly garher
rhose derermined in make a srand before rhcy all leaked our ofrhe meering
and wcnr rheir separarc ways. Thar garnering produccd rhc rwo demands
rhar were delivered ro and summarily rejcered by our Presidenr,

lam a person who mainrains grenr respeer for rhc riers orocrivism rhar
musr be raken inro considerarion ifwc hope for any acrion ro hr clfecrive.
Those riers ofacrivism dicrare char rhc sriong resisrancc i have offered should
be reserved only for rhose confliers have immediaic implicarions. Thc con»
cern over rhe budgcr curs could nor have more imrircdiare implieorions. i
urge everyone ro consider rhis whllc analyzing rhe racrics employed by orli»
ers and rhemselves. '
