When they first threatened to
bomb Serbia last fall, there was a
popular new joke told around
Belgrade about how the city will be
renamed - it will be called
BOMBeay. And last weekend
Belgrade was bombed, the very
heart of the city. blazing in flames.
I went to high school there, I am
Serbian.

Doubtlcss, this bombing is an
act of aggression, and it is totally
unjustiﬁable under international
law. The Yugoslav government did
nothing outside its own borders.

low.level civil war into which the

Welcome to Grinnell College,
the worst place in the entire universe
to be sick. You may have thought
that roller coasters, the back seats
of cars, Or even hospitals were aw.
ful places to fall ill, but no. student
life and disease are a much more le.
thal combination. Ifyou're going to
get sick, don't do it here.

When you get sick at Grinnell,
there is virtually no time for you to
heal. It is next to impossible to fall
into the role invalid. Heck, it’s im-
possible to get a full night’s sleep
without feeling incredibly guilty
about it the next morning. There are
deadlines to meet, classes to attend.
papers to write and jobs to find.
There’s simply no time for inﬁrmity
in this corner ofthe world. We seem
to have a rather severe commitment
to academia. lfthat is not the case
with you, then diets is someone else
(most likely a professor) who is try-
lng their best 'to cultivate this level
of academic intensity within you.
Even ifyou do manage to ouaran.
tine yourselfin your room and for.
get about your books, that does not
guarantee wellness. What are you
going to car? And where are you go.

- both sides an ultimatum to accept

a truce on dictated terms, to be
guaranteed by outside peacekeeping
forces. At ﬁrst, both sides turned
down this idea, which upset the
Americans very much, They ex.
plained to the Albanians that they
couldn't bomb the Serbs unless and
until the Albanians accepted the
truce terms. The Albanians finally
did so, and now the us/NATO are
bombing. in doing this, western
policy-makers all exhibit a poor un.
derstanding ofthe tradition ofpride
and defiance in the face of great
powers (Turks, Germans, Russians)
which have marked Serbian history
and culture for centuries.

Since the collapse of the Soviet
union, NATO has turned into a
club of shortsightcd and ignorant
technocratie bullies smugly mas.
querading themselves as defenders
of human rights. perhaps the real
political issue for the us is precisely

the need to justify the very erist.
ence of NATO, which no longer
has an obvious role now that the
Russian military mightseems to be
so much weakened, But why would
the US want to have NATO at all?
There seem to me to be two main
reasons, one is that its eristence in
turn justifies die current military
buildup widiin the US, which has
economic and internal political ad.
vantages for the government. The
second is that NATO is necessary
to prevent the west Europe from
straying too far from American
control and above all from estab.

NATO says that it is doing this
to avert a humanitarian catastro.

Dear Editor,

I want to thank Meredith Ibey, ‘00 for bothering to come back to the
kitchen to find out what ms going on with the soup. Yes, we made a mis.
take and I am sorry for grossing out nonmeat eaters. I wish those earlier
”concerned” students had taken the same trouble as Ms. ibey to alert the
kitchen sooner.

What I don’t thank Ms. Ihey for is the carry assumption that because of
such as mistake we are not concerned about students mealtime pleasure. it
is why we are here. Yes. there is room for improvement, but, babes, we have
come a long way from the late seventies when I started here. Then "vegetar.
ian" was the new and “better" way to ear. vegans were “hardcore" vegetar.
ians, not a separate group. With helpful suggestions and offered recipes from
students now and again, we are ever growing, slowly, but growing. When I
heard that there was to be a vegan co.op. I was hopeful that there might be
some tasty alternatives offered to dining service to broaden the choices for
vegans. The sarcasm and disdain offered by Ms. ibey neither speeds change
or feed anyone. I prefer usable constructive criticism ifa recipe isn’t avail.
able.

I eat the same meals as you all do and yes, there are days when I wonder
“What were they thinking when they planned this menu?," especially spe.
cial dinner days. But you know what? Mistakes or not, we have one ofthe
best dinning services around and I take pride in being part ofit, even when
I am stressed out, up to my elbows in bean dip, trying to convince roasted

A plea to Grinnel/ians: Your
cans can make a difference

To the Editor,

Dear students ofGrlnnell College:

For the past three years I have collected pop tops off pop and beer cans.
I take them to iowa City tothe Ronald McDonald House. some ofyou have
seen the envelopes by the Can-Cans in the dorm. Some ofyou have pitched
in pop tops and I thank you. Please keep it up, Those ofyou who have not,
I ask you to help out. The school year will be over soon and I would like to
get all the pop tops I can to make a big haul to iowa City. For any questions
you may have contact Amy Ellert. She is helping me collect these pop tops.

Sincerely,

Classrooms

BY DUSTIN GOOT

This week I must issue a warning with this article, After several
interviews and a bit ofresearch on the topic I want to address, teach.
ing at Gtinnell, I have not been able to come to any real conclu.
sions. ifanything, I’m more confused about the issue than before I
started discussing it with people, I’m an opinion writer without an
opinion, However, perhaps I can lay out some of the issues I en.
countered and you can resolve them better than i.

What led me on this seemingly fruitless journey is the impres.
sion, after seven semesters in various Grinnell classrooms, that I
could have gotten more out of my academic experience. Too often,
while filling out the end.of.course evaluation, Iwanted to write,
“The topic was really cool. I’m glad i was exposed to it, and we read
some interesting texts, but we didn’t DO anything with it. We left
it safely inside the classroom. I never really saw its implications for
my life and the world at large.” .

Apparently, I have not taken enough science classcs here. over
the past few years the science division at Orinncll has joined in a
nationwide effort to improve the teaching of science in the U.S.
With the help ofsome grants from the National Science Founda-
tion it wants to change its classroom model to cut down on student
reactions like mine, Science classes are moving to a research inten-
sive, problem. based approach

I equate this notion of problem-solving in the classroom with
the trendy educational term “active learning," which is what I feel
I’ve been lacking, Jean Ketter, Assistant Professor of Education,
defines active learning as, “learning where the student is engaged in
making meaning rather than receiving information." Wayne
Twitchell, Instructional Multimedia Technology specialist who is
offering several workshops relating to active learning this semester,
says, “In active learning I see theory and application more immcdl.
ately conjoined,"

Part of the problem is that most professors have had very little
teacher training, if any. before they’re thrust in front of the class.
room. Thus, they may not be familiar with teaching methods that
encourage active learning, and they have little time and few resources
to develop them later. For one ofTwitchell's recent active learning
workshops, conflicting meetings reduced attendance to only 10 or
12 professors. Considering all the competing interests for a
professor's time outside ofhis professional research and immediate
class preparations, it's easy to understand why we see few radical
teaching experiments here.

It’s also unfair to lay all the blame on professors for sticking

During this year i witnessed one class mercilessly throttle a pro.
fessor who was trying, albeit awkwardly, to exploit multimedia teach.
ing aids and to veer away from lectures and traditional assignments.
When he ﬁnally broke down and lectured for ninety minutes each
day, the class coocd about what an improvement it was. Certainly
the next rest became much easier, but 1 would be hard.pressed to
cite any other improvements. The professorivas obviously not reach.
ing the students, but rather than working with him to improve his
methods, students advocated a conservative classroom model with
which they were familiar. *

i know that everyone at this school cares about the quality of
teaching here, and iftheie were easy ways to improve it, they would
have been inipleinenied long ago, classroom experiments are risky
because they can always go wrong, Although my proposed solution
is “active learning," that idea can take many different forms in the
classroom and not all oftlrein work, conceding, though, the tie.
mendoiis difﬁculty ofreaching effectively, I would prefer to see more
professors and students err on the side of experimentation, in the
nature ofassignments and in the presentation ofinformatlon, rather
than the side ofsafety and, inevitably, mediocrity.
