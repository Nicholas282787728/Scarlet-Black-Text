The child is usually “are risk,"

The Buddies Program used id be

However, under rhc direcrion of

“Lindsay has really srrengrhened

who is serving as rhe program’s direc-

ror while Lindsay is srudying abroad
in Russia. “When she became direc.
ror in 1995, more were only five Bud-
dies. Thc next year, rhere were 40.
Now rhere are 60."

The program holds group oiirings
