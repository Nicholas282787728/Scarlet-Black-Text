had their way with the IC defense. Granted

the resuir was rho same; it just rook a irrrie

Saturday rfm ﬁtting orilﬁir nio weeks wit/7 a J/muldrr injury.

The ugliness resulred mosrly from rho
seemingly ubiquitous yellow flag. The rwo
reams combined for za penalnes for 246
yards, more rhan enough ro snake George
Halas roll over in his grave,

in rhe second half, rhe offenses slowed
down a bit, bur 1c was unable ro make a
gamcoflt. Illinois soorcd firsr is cur dreseore
to 39-22, when Patrick Bowman ran the ball
in from rirree yards out. Bowman carried
much ofthe 1c load on she day, running ror
158 yards on 31 carries. Any hopes ofrnakr
ing a game ofit were dashed soon arrerwards
as Grinnell seored rouchdowns on rheir new
two possessions ro put the game our ntlrand
and bring rheir mral score ro 53. Shawn Sigler
’03 came in re play quarterback in the rourrh
quarter but only arrempred (llrcc passes.

Wallace was pleased wirh rho offensive
play afhis ream on rhe day. “ourotrense has
been resring on em defense rhe last tew
weeks We wanred rhe orrensc ro ser rhe ronc

roday our guys came ro playroday," hesaid
“we have ro work on rhose (lungs [penal-
tics] rhough," he eonrinoed

Next week Grinnell rravels in conference
rival Ripon. The following week Sr. Norberr
comes in visit here. These rwo games are the
pivoral parr ofrhe season for rhe Pioneers as
rhey are eurrenrly ried wirh 5r, Norbcrr ar
rhe r‘op ofthe srandings, wirh Ripon a game
back.

“we’ve gor ro go inro the game wirh the
rnindser rhar 16s a musrswln,” Dougherry
said,

“They've gor a srrong group of receivers
and good personnel back." commented
Wallace.

The rcturn oroougherry deﬁnitely helps
the ream, but Grinneii is snll missing some
key players. “Hopefullywc can ger rhese guys
healed," said Wallace.
