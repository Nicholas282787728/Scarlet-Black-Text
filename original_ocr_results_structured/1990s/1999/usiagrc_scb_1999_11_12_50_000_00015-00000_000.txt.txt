Next up rot Ctinncll is a trip to
the NCAA Regionals, hosted by
wartburg. lttltey ﬁnish in the top
(out there, the Roos would jump
to Nationals.

“it has been a while Since we‘ve
had a legitiinateshot atgoing to the
nationals," explained Coaeh Will
Freeman, “Handing into the meet
1 think we are the hhhbest team,
so we need to step it up in order to
be in rhe top rout."

“To ouaiilyiotnationalsweean
settle for no less rhen our best raees
From everyone," cuttingliam
agreed.

Aetni had a different take. ”In
regards to the regional race, 1 think
it ean be sorely said that, ‘We went
sel, tlictcfotc we are weaseix“

Hopefully, crinttell will beable

to weasel their wayinto the national

meet, but like Freeman said, the
competition is heree st. john’s, st.
Thomas, Nebraska Wesleyan and
wartburg are the irontrunners
eoming into the raee, but the R003
aren't far behind,

oreoiirse, the toughness ofthc
opponents is in question aeeoi-ding

“l oeeasionaliy tun," said the
anonymousspy. “When I do, it’s up
and down the Mississippi River
strip. The st. Thomas team also
likes this run and I have erossed

Maybe it there’s a sale at

Ctosscounlry runner‘oan
Madigan’s ’00 running Career al-
most never happened. In middle
school, the hattiersaid he was more
interested in shooting Xl‘lrte»p0lnt-
ers than in running three miles.

“I always played basketball, and
I liked that pretty well," Madigan
said. “I had always been a quite ter-
rible runner, to be honest, in BE.
in sprinting. but l'd been decent
when we'd done the mile. So I went
out and tried running and nuiekly
round out that long distanee was
where I belonged."

Even though Madigan had
round his niche in his New Mexico
middle school, he admitted that he
nearly left it when in college.

"I really didn’t think I wanted
to run again afrer high school," he
said, “But the motel though about
it the more I wanted to run in col-
lege."

It is fortunate For his fellow
crinnell runners tbar Madigan
chose this path The senior has been
a constant conttibutor to the Pit;-
neer eross-eountry [camibcttct
known as the purple Rees—since
his ﬁrst year and serves as a team
captain this ycat.

For his part, Madigan said he
feels lucky iust to have been a part
ofthc Roos.

“l've really enjoyed being on the
team," he said. “It's been very valu-
able. lwill eertainly look baek and
think oFthe hard work and the ac-

compllshments.”

Madigan will have several surh
aeeomplislt merits to relleet on. The
Pioneers have won three eonrerenee
titles in Madigan’s four years with
the team,'ineluding the champion-
ship they took last weekend.

Much of the team’s sueeess
seems to spring from me oamata.
derie among the members.

“we all enjoy being with eaeh
otheremost orthe time," Madigan
said. “Except on long bus rides,
where some people deeide to singa
lot."

Despite any musically-induced
bad Feelings, Madigan said his time
with the R005 has been overwhelms
ingly positive.

“I would say [the team] is a
pretty htn.loving group ofindividue
als," he said. “I think every yeatl've
had a lot ofrun with the team "

Part orthis hart no doubt springs
From Madigan’slovc ofrunning. “A
lot ofpeople don’tsee why running
would be enjoyablc," Madigan said.
“You certainly do go through a
good deal otpain while you’re do»
ing it. i like the teeling ofnccom-
plishment aher doing long work-
outs and raeing well, though."

Besides running, Madigan also
admitted to a love otboth reading
and watelting the television show
“law and order."

”I guess l've gotten taitly bor.
ing in eollege. though,” he said, “I
do a lot orwotk and running doesn’t
leave a lot orextta time tor other
sturr."

currently, Madigan is working
on ﬁnishing his major in econom-
ies. He said he plans to enter the
workforce after Grinnell.

“l‘m looking forward to gradu-
ating and seeing what the real world
is like,” he said.
