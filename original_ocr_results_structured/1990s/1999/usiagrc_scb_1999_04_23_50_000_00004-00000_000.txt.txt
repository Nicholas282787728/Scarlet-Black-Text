From Behind Enemy Lines

Turn Off Your TV, Turn On Your Mind!

Clinton's war against Yugoslavia
has already been labeled in foreign
media as the American liberals‘ War.
And very aptly So, I might add. It s
pretty interesting: if you talk to _a
'few people from other colleges, you
will soon come to realize that one
ofrhe few colleges in the nation that
is silent about the war in Kosovo is,
well, this “progressive" hippicepopu—
lated Midwest enclave. Iwant to see
just how genuine that spark ofcriti-
eism and questioning is that made
you want to come here to Iowa, of
all places. “Turn ofryour'l'v, turn
on your mindl" . so goes a popular
motto of the student prorests in
Belgrade from two years ago. In this
spirit, I compose this list ofpoints
for you, dear reader, to reflect on.
1. Kosovo is the cradle of
Serbian cultural identity. As you
* might have already heard, Kosovo
(in Serbian it means Field ofBlacke
birds) was the site ofa bloody battle
in 1389, so terribly bloody, that it
was difﬁcult to tell right away who
won and who lost, both the Serbian
King Lazar (after whom my father
is named) and the Turkish Sultan
Murat were killed. The way my
family remembers it, in a massive
Serbian exodus (to escape the lam»
tal ottoman aggressor), our ancese
tors crossed the Danube to settle
further north. This happened about
six hundred years ago, and that was

a very long time indeed, about a
century before that Columbus guy
sailed up these shores.

2. Imagine ifEurops had forced
President Lincoln to accept South»
crn independence and European
troops on American soil, and had
threatened to intervene militarily on
behalf ofrhe Confederate Army if
Lincoln refused. You don't have to
imagine too hard. after all, the
unprecedentedly bloody American
Civil War appalled Europeans just
as much as the Kosovo conflict docs
Americans today. Or: imagine if
some third power (say, China) were
to bomb New York because of see
vcre violations ofhuman rights by
the NYPD.

3. Minorities in Yugoslavia have
had much greater rights than mi-
norities have here in the US. Un-
like Hispanics or Chinese or
Iakotas, Hungarians in Voivodina
and Albanians in Kosovo have free
access to state schools and media in
their language. Medical care is (al.
most) free for all citizens onugo»
slavia. Albanian separatists chose to
boycott this system, including the
elections; their choice was to (me
bark on a path ofrcrrorism and vio»
lence. At the same time, Hungare
ians in Vojvodina continue to live
peacefully (except for this bombing)
in that same barbarian country
(Hungary being a fresh NATO
member).

4. Your ”humanitarian" bombs
are falling on everyone in Yugosla-
Serbs, Albanians,
Monrenegrins, Hungarians, cyp-
sies, and other peoples who make
up the multiethnic Federal Repub.

via:

lic onugoslavia, soldiers and civil-
ians alike‘; Milosevic's supporters
and people who never voted for
him (like my family),

5. Ifyou believe that the Ram»
bouiller “Agreement“ is a fair one,
go ahead and read it first. You can
download it from my webpagc:

viduals/milin

6. Remember lessons of
Munich (a favorite ost Albright)
and German invasion or Czecho-
slovakia in 1938? Let's review:
Hitler claimed that the invasion was
necessary to stop rthnic violence
against German minority in
Sudctenland. The Nazis encour—
aged an anti.czech movement in
the region and then used the repres-
sion ofthar movement as an excuse
for invading the entire country.
What would have happened if
Czechs had refused to sign the
Munich Agreement _ maybe they
too would have been bombed by
England and France?

7. Smart bombs: only 40% of
American bombs hir their targets
in Iraq and Yugoslavia alike. Think
about what happens when they
don’t. And remember Hiroshima
and Nagasaki. Remember them
because that is the only historical
example of a “successtul” air war.
Bombs can’t stop the killing. They
only make it worse

a. This war will cost many bil-
lions ofdollars, money stolen from
housing, health care, education.
Each cruise missile costs around $1
million. The only ones who will
benefit are the military-industrial
complex and big business. General

9. (This one is forAndrrw who
seemed confused by something I
wrote two weeks ago.) before
NATO’s intervention, about 2,000
civilians were killed in Kosovo
(same as murder rate in Washing.
ton DC). They were mainly ethnic
Albanians killed by the Serbs, but
also Serbs killed by the Km. What
was happening in l<osovo, prior to
the NATO bombing was simply a
civll war, like many other conflicts
around the globe, a terrible thing,
to be sure, but certainly nothing
comparable to the Holocaust of
Jews, or the genocide against the
Native peoples ofNorth America.

10. Do you really believe that
the Pentagon is a humanitarian re-
licfagency? come onl Think again.

II, In 1995, there was a mas.
sive, CIA-supported, operation of
ethnic cleansing of Serbs from
Croatia. I have relatives who were
among the “lucky" ones that es.
caped. Already impoverished
through years of economic sanc-
tions, Serbia was flooded with hun-
dreds ofthousands ofrefugees, and
in coping with this crisis, we were
given virtually no Western assis.

Judging by some ofrhe ragamufﬁn students
sauntering around unshaven, unshowered, and,
generally, unkempt, one wouldn't think that

.. Grinnell concerns itselfmuch with other peoples
perceptions. Yer, recently, many students have
the impression that Grinnell has become institu.
tionally image—conscious. It's been caught peek»
inginsomcofthecoolerfashionmags. It‘sstarte

ing to comb its hair, tuck in its shirt and polish its shoes. Some have even
caught a whiff ofcologne when Grinnell passed by.

In short, it seems like Grinnell wants to be popular, And how is the
higher education in.crowd identified these days? Well, more brutally and
publicly than at any high school (I hope), entrants in the college popularity
contest are given a precise ranking which is published in a best-selling issue
of US. News owed! Report. Ifthar happened at my high school, I might
have frequented the J. crew outlet more myself. Nonetheless, Grinnell
students tend to have the outsidcr’s mentality and they fail to see the impor-
tance ofthis mme, They worry that the college is too concerned about its
reputation. They feel somewhat slighted.

When asked about Grinnell’s attitude towards the rankings, Mickey
Munlcy, Grinnell’s Director of Public Relations, said, “The rankings are a
mystery to every school in that survey Nobody likes the rankings, but if
they're ranked number one, they like that." Students should also under-
stand that the rankings are determined from the simple survey data Munley
mentioned. Although the first lists were basically vague extrapolations from
the judgments ofvarious deans, us. Now now takes great pains to collect
various quantitative data.

As such, Grinnell’s position in the middle ofrhe top 25 is probably quite
safe for years to come. To the allegation that Grinnell would sell its soul to
break into the top five, Munley answers, “One thing that’s important to us is
applicants. I don’t think anyone here labors under the illusion that moving
from number eleven to number seven will bring us significantly more appli»
canrs." The rankings are a great scapegoat for students who disapprove of
administrative decisions. I, too, resorted to this racric in an earlier column
criticizing Convocation, but I was as wrong as anyone else who sees the
rankings as the cause ofunpopular policies.

Thar doesn't mean that Grinnell isn’t working on its image, but perhaps
a makeover isn't such a bad thing. Presently, Grinnell's public image could
be summed up as follows: a good, small school located in Iowa. The “lo—
cated in Iowa" clause has certain implications, too. I think most ofus can
remember the witty corn jokes we got when we told our friends we were

cow every day for breakfast."

Our playful peers are not the only ones latching onto the Iowa Stem»
types. The builder} Guide to the College: 1993 writes, “Situated between the
bridges of Madison County and baseballs field of dreams lies one of the
bestkept secrets in higher education." The writing In other college guides
is equally steeped in Iowa mythology.

Speakingabout perceptions ofGrinncll's location, Karen Kristof, Senior
Associate Director ofAdmisslon, says, “It’s a tough challenge. Some people
think you shouldn‘t talk about location.” Kristofand Manley both insist
that crinnells location is an advantage because the dearth ofcxternal at.
rracrions raises the importance of the student community. However, in
such items as the pamphlet devoted to crinnells global perspectives and

. another brochure whose cover features the sentence, “In the middle of

America, you’ll discover the world,” Grinnell’s literature obviously tries to
combat typical impressions ofrhe Midwest.

The college is also tired ofrhe idea ofbeing a “bestkept secret," as the
Insider? Guide chooses to call it. Munley explains, "I go to lots ofeonfer—
ences and from talking to people at other schools, everyone is a best-kept
secrets“ Kristoffurrhcr admits that Gtinnell may have been too humble or
self-effacing in the past, and she looks forward to a new viewbook, which
should speak more forcefully about Grinnell’s rigor and intellectualism.

Recently, students have complained mat Grinnell is trying to become
mainstream, that it's worrying too much about its public relations.

The Terrors) of

Welcome to Iowa, home of
the weirdest weather patterns on
the planet. No, iris not your
imagination, and no, you are not
having a bad dream. There Sim»
ply is no such thing as a consise
tent weather pattern here.

Spring in Iowa is like a slap
in the face. The vision ofspring
as a season oflife, in which calm
breezes gently warm the land and
a smiling sun beams light on the
little flowers struggling up out of
the rich soil is the biggest joke
ever. I always thought that I was
missing out as a kid when I read
in my storybooks about the
beauty of spring. I‘ve lived in
Iowa all my life (hold the com-
ments, please),
and there has
never,,l repeat
never been a
spring that can
be classiﬁed as
anything other
than schizo-
phrenic.

First of all,
spring is
COLD. The
wind blows
hard, despite
the fact that it
may be per-
fectly sunny,

our the win.
dow in the
morning to ascertain the appro-
priate amount of layers you
should don will not give you the
sort of weather detecting accu—
racy you need ro stay truly com-
fortable (or fend off frostbite).
spring is deceptive like that. You
think it's tank top time until the
second that outside loggia door
slams behind you in a breezy fifty
mile per hour wind. And you
thought that the weather person
was out ofrhcir gourd when they
said it was only thirty-(W0 de-
grees in Des Moines.

secondly, spring does not
mean the end of all winter
weather. Remember a couple of
mornings ago when you rolled
out ofbed, stretched, opened the
curtains and were confronted
with SNOW? Yep, snow. Big
fluffy ﬂakes accumulating right
before your astonished eyes.
Now, if you still, for some un-
known reason, associare spring
with the gentle nurturing of
Mother Nature's precious king-

"lll'lllllllllilmltuu
lll'lIllilvlllplﬂlllllllllll

dom, I have only one question:
WHY? Not to burst anyoncs
bubble, but that probably won’t
be the last time it'snows in
crinnell before near‘Novembcr.
I could be wrong. but I doubt it,
It’s spring. In Iowa.

Thirdly, due to the reasons
enumerated in the first two
points, spring is rather depress-
ing. Now, I’m not trying to be
cynical. I’m simply pointing out
a psychological fact.

Seriously, what is more de-
pressing than getting up in the
morning, thinking that the day
before was absolurclyspectaculat,
looking forward to more social-
izing and homework (yeah, right)

on the F0-
rum Beach,
only to be
greeted with
a snow—
storm? I
don’t want
to dwell in
the depths
ofdespair, so
here’s some-
thing posi-
tive about‘
whole
thing: there
is a good
chance that
by four in
the after—
noon it will
bewarm outside, rclarivclyspeak-
ing.

And when its warm outside,
the students flock to the grass,
benches, sidewalks, any place
they can find that is in the sun.
Never mind all we have learned
about skin cancer and UV rays.
Give me some sun, babyl

One of my friends also
pointed out the fact that musical
instruments (and consequently
those individuals who play them)
seem to come out of the wood»
work when its warm. Wandering
throughout campus, you are fol-
lowed by the strains of guitars
and sometimes hand drums, gui-
tars, and ...well, guitars,

I think that we, as individu-
als need spring so that we don’t
become shriveled up little elves
who live in the library.

Spring is vital for our overall
well- being. but don't forget—

- spring does not necessarily like

you. It has a personality all it’s
own, and a whacked one at that.

 

 

Frankly, though, Grinnell's PR has sucked in the past, and I’m glad
it's becoming a higher priority I hare awkwardly having to end
conversations with people because they have absolutely nothing to
say about Grinnell. I hate going outwith my friend from Notrc

students are definitely proud ofGrinnell’s academic program, I
can’t count the number of times I’ve heard the mythical statistic
about Grinnells second hardest workload (and I'll give as to any.
onewho can show me that ranking in print). so why shouldn't we
be happy to see Grinnell transformed from higher education’s cute
country wallflowcr into a prom queen? Whyshouldn't Grinnell be
invited to all the coolest parties? We will carry the Grinncll name
with us for the rest ofourlivcs. Itwould be nice ifthat name meant
