Concerned

Dear co neerned,

rhey appear in rhe mourh, ﬁom kissing. Ifyou have sores,
I would advise you re see a docror while rhey are presenr.
Your doeror ean look a: rhem a nd res! rho liquid from
rhem ro dererrnine wherher you have Herpes.

Unril you know for sure, avoid kissing and giving
unproreered oral sex. Cold sores ﬁorn rhe Herpes virus
could give your parrner cold sores in ihe mourh or genie
ral Herpes.

Herpes is rhe only STD lisred on rhe Cenrral lowa

pes, Warrs, Hepaeius ls. NGU. and syphilis spread
rhrough oral , anal. and vaginal sex. scienrisrs are snll
uneerrain wherher Hlv spreads rhrough oral sex.

carry a virus such as Herpes wieh no previous sexual his»
rory. You or your partncr may have a disease ﬁom oral.

Grinnellian of the
Millennium: Me

By Amanda DeSimone

l mer Amanda DeSimone ’00 ﬁn a cup ofeorfee ar bobs on a eool, Autumn evening,
The word rhar eomes ro mind: perfccuon,
However, choosing Desimone ro be “Grinnellian ofthe Millennium” was no easy rear.
lr was a close eall beiween her and God. Yer, God was ﬁnally disqualiﬁed because He never
arrended Grinnell 7 nor even for one semesrer as was rumored. According ro Desnnone, God would nor have been a
good ehoiee even if He had arrended Grinnell. When DeSimone called God during lasr years all phonarhon, He
reiused no make a eonrriburion.

“So God says ro me, ‘Why should i give re Grinnci]? Grinnell has more money rhan Ma.”

While such selﬁshness mighr be aeceprable m a “Grinnellian oirhe Week" candidare, ir would be unbecoming in
rhe “Grinnellian oirhe Millennium."

Desunone, more humble rhan mosr, does nor require a sash as did lonarhan Brand when he was pzoclaimcd
"Grinnellian orrhe Week."

“Perhapslonarhan Brand needs somerhing rangible ro remind him ofhis srarus,"srared DeSirnone, “bur my memory
is srrong. lwill never for'ger rhae I was “Grinnellian orrhe Millcnnium.” She wenr on re say, “I’m forever, Mr. Brand.
You're iusr renrporary,"

Back in California, DeSirnones parenrs rhrew a srarsrudded parry ro celebrare rheir daughrer's success,

“She’s by far my favorire child." said Mrs DeSimone.

DeSimone’s lseyearold sisrer said rhar being relared ro Amanda DeSimone has been rhe highlighr ofher life.

“h hurrs me to rhlnle rharwhile we were growing up. I are food rbar she could have been caring, and l rook some of
our parems' airenrion away irorn her," said rhe lirrle brar, "Fortunately, l've learned from her example, How could i
have been so selﬁsh?"

ln addirion ro being perfecr, DeSimone cares deeply abour her eommuniiy.

“I wanr ro make a real difference in rhe world," she said. “Thai's why I'm going ro become a supermodel and marry
a dirry, old, rich man."

When asked why she decided ro graee Grinncll wirh her presenee, DeSimone responded conﬁdenrly rhar Satan
would rurn her ﬁrsr—born child inro a gear had she nor ehosen Grinnell.

”And rhar would not do, {or i disrrusr goars," said DeSimone. “And people who look like goats,” she added aﬁer a
momenr oirellecrion.

presidenr Osgood was unavailable for commenr. Bur as safe ro say ehar he is very proud othsimone’s many
aeeomplishmenrs,

“You're a winner, DcSimunc,” is probably whas he would have said.

My inrerview wirh DeSimone was beautifully summed up by DcSimonc hczself.

”I’m all rhar," she said. And, indeed, she is.
