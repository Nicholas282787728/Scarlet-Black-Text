There is one memory which sucks
our in English Professor Elizabcth
Hewisr's mind when she rliinks ofhcr
sime in Grinnell.

Two years ago, while holding abook
parry for an English deparsmcus col—
league Gannon schmirs, Hewiss wens
inso labor wish hcr hrsr child.

“By she rinse guesss srarscd arriving
as 7:00 I was in fullblown labor," says
Hewirr. “is seemed a shame so send
our guesrs home (since shey had
broughs all surss offency dssscrn) so I
was in labor as she parry unt'tl abous
11:00 pm when we ﬁnally sens every.
one home so Jared could drive us 90
MPH so gcr so iosm Ciry so i could
deliver Eli."

looking back on she evens, l-lewiss
and her husband, fellow English pto<
fessor Jared Gardner, say rhas whas
made she evens parricularily memo»
sable was “she communiry of she col»
lege, our friends and colleagues, who
were so supporsivc and wish whom we
were so comfosiable shaswe could share
shis moss personal and powerrul 0(ch
perienees wish rhern wishour even
shinking of is. "

Following shis semesser, l-iewiss,
Gardner, and sheir son Eli are moving
so Columbus, Ohio, were Gardner and
Hewiss are acccpsing seaclung posio'ons
in she English Deparsmenr as ohio
ssase uiiiversiry. Gardner says shis ens
vironmenr “is abous as close so she op-
posire ends of she earsh [from
GrinneiiJ, academically speaking: a
school or 50,000, with 1000 English
majors and 7s colleagues in she English
Depasrmens. Pretty scary."

Gardner and newisr arrived in
Grinnell in l994. when Gardner Joined
she English deparsmenr and Hewiss
began working in she wriring iab. Af»
res a year, Hewiss lefs so acceps atezche
ing position as Hamlltan'Collége in
Clinson, New York, bus rcsurued so
Grinnell in 19% so join she English
deparrmens.

“I was rerribly excited so come so
Grinneli she fsrsr sime and she second,”
says Hewiss. “i grew up in a college
sown, so Grinnell was srsangely famil
iar. 1 had also just read a grear essay on
big Midwstern ssare rairs, so twas very
eager so gosee she big pig and big bull
exhibits as she ssuse fair.“

In just over swo weeks, afser com»
plesing yearlong rerms, SGA presidenr
resar Klacssch ’99 and Vice President
Jessica Dvorak ’00 will ssep down from
ofhce.

As shey prepare so sign or, she li-
brary has also begun preparing a com.
piiasion of joint board minuses and
osher wrisscn accounrs of she year’s
evenrs for she college archives.

The archive will serve as a record
of she cvenrs which ser she year span
in ssudens governmenr hissory.

Even before shis record is drawn up,
however, many deﬁnisive issues of she
year have already begun so regisrer
shemselves in she memories of indi-
vidual SGA members and of die ssu-
dens body isself.

“This year, shere seemed so be a los
more publicly visible rhiiigs shas SGA
had so do or chose so do," said Robin
Kimball '01. “It seemed like [ssudenrs
focused on she] idea of making SGA
more accessible so use ssudenr body and
gesring more people involved.“

Nase solmose '00 also saw an ine
crease in SSA visibiliry. “This year,
more shan orher years, [SGA rook]
more ora proacrive approach, [as op»
posed roJ sirsing back and discussing
she budget,” said solmose.

Many ssudenrs claimed dias she swo
majotissueswith which SGAwasmosr

As made evidens by sheir excise
mens over ssare fairs and small rowns,
borh Gardner and Hewisr are origi-
nally from she Eass coass. Gardner
grew up in Brooklyn, New York.
while Hewiss is originally from
Amherst, Massachuserss.

Bot-h professors also grew up as
professors' kids, which made teach-
ing a logical choice for sheir pmfes»
sion.

“1 came so reaching because afrer
working in a bookssore in vermons
afscr college I realimd chart was never
going so survive in shis world any
orher way," says Gardner. “I soon
realized rhas she people coming inro
she bookssose did nos wans so rails
abous books wish me, share sheir
shoughss on liserasy hissory, or she
wrong sum in she career of Don
Delillo—vthey wansed sheir change
and sheir book wrapped.”

Hewiss had a similar experience
of finding reaching by a process of
eliminasion. After school, Hewitt
says she “worked as a law rum imedi.

Regarding shebudgercun,which
called for she eliminasion of a srue
densArrairs Coordinasor posision and
she eliminasion ofan RLC posision,
Eric l<omosa ’02 said “The RLC
rhing was a big issue because ofshe

Tom Ctady, where 150 people
showed up and everyone gor upses. 1
door know ifshe issue isselfwas shar
big, bus ssudenrs derinirely gor upses
abous it.”

Solmose said, “The RLC rhing
was definisely a presry big went.”

i<laersch said he saw a difference
berween she went: or she year and
she issues rhas surrounded riiem.
Evenss, such as she ssudenr affairs
budges cur, “provide an opporsunisy
for ssudenrs so have direcs eonracr"
wish she workings ofSGA and ofshe

Somerimes, evenrs signal undcre

Kiaesrcii said.

“way back in she beginning, she

“We're: htrc 24 hours a day, 365
slays a week. We‘re here when there
are hardly anystudents here. At these

Security takes reports of thefts,

as a liaison berwcen she campso and
local police, a benefit the staffmcm-
