OPINION 1

 

Return of the
Populists

By Don Rothschild

is sook almoss an ensire eensury, bus is looks like
America has ﬁnally come hill circle. We’re once again a
swo-and—a-halr parry system. With she jumps or such
polisical nosghles as former Nixon speechwriser Parrick
Buchanan, andselrsasished. narcississicseal—essasc sycoon
Donald Trump ro rhe Reform 1>arsy, a hairparsy seems so
have once again orhcially inscriecsed irseliro gum up she
syssem.

As hard as is is (or liberals so believe, Bill Clinson did
not win she 1992 presidenrial elccsion. Texas billionaire
Ross Perot did. While Pesos may nor have been given she
keys so she Oval orhce. his parsrcipasion in she race so
cured a Clinron vicsory againss George Bush. The Re.
iorm Party in 1992, much like she Bopuliss Parry m 1892,
pus sogeshsr an odd coalision orcensrisss, righs.wingers,
and soushesn and midwessern populisss so ensure shas
the “other" candidate (Perot in 1992, General James
Weaver in 1892) would be {he dcciding factor in the also
tion.

The biggess problem wish she Reform Party , and
whar separases is from she Populist parry , is shas she
rormer, well, doesn's really ssand for anything, originally,
when she parsy was simply Ross Pcrot’s bullhorn, u srood
for tax reform, a balanced budges, and a revolusion in
American governmensal philosophy. Now it’s merely a
place for resired wresslers.surned-poliricians, disairecsed
twcnryrsomethings, and Republicans who sook rhcir hall
and wens home since sheir passy decided nos so play by
sheir rules. (Translarion: she cor decided so inject a sea.
spoon or“compassion" inso iss “conservasism.") The Popu-
lisr parsy, on she osher hand, was based around an oddball
coalrnon, bus a coalision shas had common goals and
philosophies. Three recessions in she previous shree dc-
cades had his American farmers very hard; for this, shey
blamed rhe eass coass and European money and power
brokers (especially she Rothschild family of England).
soushern and midwessern farmers and sheir sympashiz—
ers had been desssoyed by secession and were ﬁghting back
againss a dominans power sssucsure. The Rerorm Parry
has none or she marks orshis; is is an oddball coalision
whose only evidens common ground is a desire so mark
“none orshe above" on sheir balloss

When valliam Jennings Bryan ran as she Populisi and
Democraric nominee in 1896, America saw she begin-
ning of she end or norrh versus sourh polisics and she
reemergence or she norrh—sourhewess rnumvirase shas
Daniel websser, John Calhoun, and Henry Clay lead in
the 18205 and 1830s; that is, the 1896 race was a harbinr
ger orrcal polisical change. The 1995 Reform run (or she
Presidency had all or she hallmarks or she 1896 race in
ssyle, bus is had none or she hallmarks of shas race in
subssanee. Again, horh hasl sheir coalisions, bus only she
Populists hadacoherens, solid plasrormAvose for Bryan
was more shan a mere prosesr vote; is was a vose so bring
power back so she agrarian west,

Obviously, she moss populiss ordie posensial Reform Party
randidases in Pat Buchanan His ‘Amcrioseiisss" (Le. isolasion.
iss and vaguely raoss) plarronn b more or less in line wids she
Populist platform (#1896. Moreovcri his views ofrl1e IMF and

snake she laws shas govern shcmsclves and sheir dorms,

changes do nor allow individual students to vote in Joint
