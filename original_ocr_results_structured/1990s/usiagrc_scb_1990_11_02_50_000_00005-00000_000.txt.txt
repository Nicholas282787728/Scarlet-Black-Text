Professor Karl DeLong, the ACM

program has lured students to do so
since 1962.

“The study of the environment

who is the campus adviser for the
program.

sessions in June and July of each

smallField Station, seven miles out
of town, for about month. The
station is located in the wildemess

Each student has
the choice of one
of several four-
credit courses
studying biology,
ecology and other
various subjects,
including archae-
ology or literature.

ting, studying na-
ture by living with
it instead of only
reading about it in books. The

the wilderness survival program),
butmost participants areenthusias-
lie about the program,

"It was wonderful . . , lwould
for sure do it again," stud Hcidi
Freiburgcr, a recent pnrtimpant.

One domiitory houses all the
students living on the WFS “cam—
pus.” Each day, including some
weekends, students start class in
the morning. Class might lasta full
orhaitday,inciudinga lunch break.
On some days, students might find

quite literally “in the ﬁeld." On
such ventures the students must co-
operate with a very small group of
peopleforextendod periods of time.
They study the geology and eco-
systems of the region, including
animals suchasbaldeagles,wolves,
squirrels, fish and insects.

"rhecoursesforlastsummerwere
especially diverse. They included
Field Biology. which consisted of
observing living things in their
natural habitat, while the professor
commented on the ecological rela-
tionships among the organisms.

There are no bars or
nightclubs for miles,
so students create
their own individual
and group activities
for their free time in
this natural area...
..the scene is "very
freewheeling."

Behavioral Zoology focused on
observation and analysis of the
feeding, social, and reproductive
behavior of animals. Behavioral
Ecology of Mammals involved the
study of mammals in an evolution-
ary perspective. including observe
ing individual mammals' intertitIr
tions with members of their own
species and other species. All
classes also included independent
study projects.

Ornithology was another course
offered last summer. The focus of
thatcourse was bird ecology, but in
order to study birds. theecology of
the whole region had to be taken
into account. One day the protes-
sor had the cook prepare whole
roast chicken for dinner, and stu-
dents spent most of that dinner

more culinary perspective.

The canoe trips were an integral
part of the curriculum. Unlike any
study field trips offered in convene
tional classes. the students went
with the teacher in groups ofnine,
on week-long camping trips. They
traveled into
Ontario, Canada,
in almost com
plete isolation
from all other
people. in “absor
lutely beautiful
country," learn
ing about the sur-
roundings, sur-

The social as-
pect is another
important part of
the WFS. The

it all the more challenging and re-
warding. Thcrc are no bars or

After a 55 year break, an old
Grinnetl activity was revitalized.
Oxford Union debating was re»
started on campus in front of an
audienceofover 140 peopleOct. 4.

Two threevperson panels argued .

over the motion that drugs should
bclcgalizcd. Arguingin favorwere
Richard Clerkln. Tolan Steele and
John Nickerson, and against were
Jason Gerber, DcvantScheidlerand
David Karol.

The debate was at times hu-
morousandalways contentious.
Humor figured heavily in the
argument of the proponents of
the motion, and was not en.
tirely related to it. Steele tor
ceived aqucslion that appeared
to be a marriage proposal from
the floorand replied. “Refresh-
menls will be served after the
debate."

But the main emphasis was
on the question of decrirninal-
ization of drugs. Nickerson
called on the audience not to be
swayed by thcemoiionalism of
the other side. Steele talked of
drugs being made taxable and
thus controllable. while Clerkin arr
gucd for the introduction of poli-
cies that would treat addicts as
“victims, not criminals." He saw
those who opposed legalization as
a ”moral majority."

Such argumentswerenotbought
by the opposition in any way.
Gerber and Schcidlcr argued that
legali7ali0n of drugs would lead to
a rash of addiction. Karol alleged
that drug addicts had no “moml
automony" and that one could not
be allowed to sell oneself to drugs
anymore than to bc enslaved.

The Grinncll Debating Union is
a new collegerfundod activity that
operates as part of the Grinncll For
rcnsics League. Richard Bright,

Director ofForcnSlc Acti vities and '

the Union‘s adviser, emphasized
the great difference bctwccn
American high school debuting and
the Union style.

Such debating differs from
Americandcbatingintheorgnniza-
tion of the match, the techniques
employed and the method of deter-
mining the “winning” side.

tional appeals, insults and intcllco
tual analysis of the resolution in
question,“ said Bright.

However. theimplementationof
other persuasive means aside from
logic is not Oxford Union‘s only
distiction. This style of debate
makes extensive use of audience
participation. The outcome of Lhc
debate is determined by the number
of audience members who ﬁle out
one of two doors marked “Yea" or
"Nay." The young rtgurcs for the
first debate were 60 in favor, 65
against and 14 abstentions.

A Union debate tends to be it
very animated torurn as it is de-
signed for both serious debating

and entertainment.

in the original 1925 debate.
Grinnell narrowly lost its first
match. with Cambridge Univ
versity. by 118 to i 19. During
the decade of its existence on
campus, the student body was
to take an avid interest in the
Union'svariouslnLramuraland
inlemational matches.

ThcrchmergenceoIOxl'ord
Union dcbatc on campus stems
from ti desire on the part of its
members not only to raise seri-
ous topics, but also to give stu—
dents the opportunity to de-
velop communicative and per-
suastve skills.

“One thing other faculty
members and l have nolived is
the anxiety ofsomc students in
speaking in trout oi their peers
duringclass. There isahope thatin
expanding the College‘s forensic
program, this problem can be re-
duced or alleviated," Said Mark
Montgomery,assistantprofessorof
economics, who is a coradviser to
the Union.

After the great success of the
first debate, the Union intends to
run a second this semester. A pror
visional title has been agreed upon,
though changes to itare still likely.
A Sign of lhc Union’s health is lhc
rapidly expanding mailing list, not
to mention lhc large tumoul to the
firstdebatc. with such support the
Union looks set for good times
ahead after its long hiatus.
