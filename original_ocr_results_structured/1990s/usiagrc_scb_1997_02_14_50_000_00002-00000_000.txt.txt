“1 love the moment before play
ing in a recital, when everything is
quiet," explains Rebeeca Harins. On
Friday night, in Heirick Chapel,
Hanns’ ﬂair for piano and perfor-
malice will be shown to the campus
when she plays in her senior recital.
“Rebecca is a vcry lyrical player, she
has the musicality which you just
can't teach," cxplttins assistant mue
sic professor Eugene Gaub Hows
over. while she possesses an ability
to understand the phrasing and cl‘l’lOr
lion ofmusic, it has only come to tier
after years of hard work.

“I tirststaned playing piano, when
I was probably four. I had heard a
violin concerto and was stuck on
playing the violin. However, my
parents said that] first had to learn

piano." Now, a couple of decades

latcr. she has blossomed into a pla-
nisl who has developed adisciplilled
appreciation of the piano and the
music she plays. Her emotional at-
tacllment to the music can be seen
through her description ofthc beauty
ofsound. “I really like silence," she
says: A silence which numbs hcr
senses into playing the music of
Bach, Chopin and Bartok. She pasr
sionately describes hereincyinent of
musically dancing between the sir
lencc alid her mum. “I really love
playing late at night at Herrick
Chapel," she says, in reference to the
building’s silence. However. emo-
tional attachment to the sound of
music is only one component of
Haniis’ piano playing. Devotion to
developing the physical connection
with the music is also essential Cre-
ating this physical connection is
“verylnlellcctually demanding,”cm-
phasizes Harms, Yet, her fascination

Crumb

Crumb is a twoehour documenr
tary about a Schmuck. Robert
Crumb’s life is his work, and vice
versa; to see a welleedited film very
sion of this artist and his demons, if
it does anything at all, will make you
want to meet the guy. The portions
devoted to Crumb’s crazy history
and family may be interesting, but
what saves this lZO-minutc tranquil-
izer is the man‘s work and inspira-
tion.

From his works, the most fascir
noting parts
are by far his
raw portrays
als of
women. In
one of the
doumleiitary’s
best scenes,
the subject
of one of
C r u m b ' s
draw i n g 5
comments
that this par-
ticular work
gave her “a
new self-im-
age.” She
praises his
capacity to depict women as they
truly are: immediatelyfollowing this
remark we are shown a beautiful
portrait of a sweet young girl, unr
dcrnealh which Is a caption: “this
picture is taken from a plastic
coaster, meant for putting cups on "
Crumb’s powerful women also emit
sexuality, possibly explaining his
rondevous with Big Bull magazuic,
to which another very interesting
scene is devoted. In five words. Rob-
ert Crumb likes to draw. And ifyou
like to draw, or like watching people
draw, you should hit Harris on Sun

Ransom

When the Tom Mullen’s (Mel
Gibson) son is kidnapped with a two
million dollar ransom, he pays up.
When the drop goes wrong, he turns
the ransom into a bounty on the head
of the kidnapper, In one of this
year’s biggest blockbusters, the con
cept is all there. Ransom has some
clever and exciting moments, but in

a domestic thriller in which Tom, the
bourgeois family man grown come

in touch with his animal instinct. He
has to descend to the kidnapper's

is. That’s a terriﬁc subject for a
thrillcr, but diicctor Ron Howard is

Harms to charm Herrick crowd tonight

with and love orclassical music pron
vidcs the fuel for her three to five
hours of practice every day. “Classi-
cal music is very complex. The more
you study ll; the more complex it
gets, as it constantly reveals differ-
ent lcvcls," Harms says,

One of tile layered pieces that
Harms will be playing is Bela
Bartok's Piano Concerto No.3 with
accompaniment by Eugene Climb.
Both Gaub and Hamis emphasiLe the
amount of time and effort this piece
has taken to develop. Through this
discipline, Harms has realized a cer-
tain beauty of Bartok’s piece. She
describes how you want to “let your
self go with notes, as you both rc»
fleet and celebrate life." This melo-
dramatic explanation is grounded in
the fact that Bartok was “dying dure
ing the composition ofthc piece and,
in tact, died before fully completing
it,”

TheLiberalArts -

Last Sunday she treated residents
ol the Mayﬂower home and students
who made the trek to a preparatory
performance at the Mayﬂower's
Carman Auditorium. At the May»
ﬂower, she played half of her Fri
day night program, describing it as
“a good chanceto get thejitters out."
On Friday night she will be playing
selections from Bach’s “The Well-
Tcmpcred Choir", works by Frederic
Chopin and Bela Bartok's Piano
Concerto No.3. As incentive to go,
Harms grins and says, “if anyone
ever wants to befriends With me ever
again, they better come." Even more
incentive was provided by student,
Each Ly, when she said, “Rebecca
is the coolest person in the world."
Come Friday night to Herrick
Chapel at 8:00 PM and let the
“coolest person in the world",
Rcbecca Harms. present you with a
relaxed “evening of good music."
