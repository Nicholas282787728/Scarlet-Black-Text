Nightmare in
Taxi Driver

Enter the world of Travis
Biclde.

The city is slimy, dirty New
York. People are yelling. Cars
are honking. Everyone is in a
hurry to get somewhere, and you
can just go to hell for all anyone
cares. It is nothing short of an
urban nightmare. Welcome to

Travis drives a taxi at night,

exposing himself to a city that he
grows to hate. Something of a
psychotic, Travis developsan ob-
sessive preoccupation with the
“garbage" of the streemithe
hookers, pimps, and hustlers
During the day he takes occa-
sionalnapsinhisnrn-downaparte
merit, drinks peach brandy,
watchespomfilms,andp0pspi]ls
to calm himself down. This man
knows how to live.

At one point Travis writes in
his diary: “1 don't believe that
one should devote his life to
morbid self»attenlion." But this is
exactly what he does. He notices
that his headaches are getting
worse He suspects that he is de-
veloping stomach cancer. He
worries that he is insigniﬁcant.

Travis‘ mental health is ques»
tionabler He decides that the only
way he could make a name for
himself was by assassinating a
candidate for the Presidential
nomination. Realizing this, he
plans accordingly.

lmnweed features Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep as two destitute
streetrdwellers who exist on the seedy edges of Depression-Era Al-

reject by choice. Nicholson'scharacter is especially intriguing. Haunted
by literal, jeering ghosts of the past, he is oppressed by the psychologi-
cal weight of past mistakes that are never dealt with.
