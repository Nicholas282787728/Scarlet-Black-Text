World Trade Organizaion protests in Seattle affect important basketball game

By Chris Dietrich

This wut‘i’ in Semitic, (hull-no

Sonics emerals and the gntne
wtts not in yeopardy orbeing post-
poned despite tttolent protests in
downtown Seattle at the opening
of the World Trade Organization
tneeungTuesday,

“We talked to the league, and
ritcy wart: well versed on the WTO
situation," said Sonics executive
John Drcscl. “This was an NBA
decision to pluy the game, not a
Sonlcs tleeisien. it was the right
decision."

Thcnttcndonce wasannounccd
M a Capﬂclty 17,072, but there were
n lot orempty seats at Key Arena
as many fans apparently stayed
home because of concerns about
the WTO protests. The ehanee to
see a live basketball gnme may he
the highlight of many a suburban
kid's mundane week, and that suht
urban kid missed 2 chance last

'litesday tA ehnnee to see heroes
up close .n ehanee to see n drum
netttslly lived . n eltttnee to stt
down with a livehuek sodn and
serentn nt the other term.

Well, at letst they didn’t miss a
leeklusret perrortnnnee by their
Sonies, who were blown out by the
Lnkers 101.77 l>revtously the
Sonies were 570 in Seattle. They
were nowhere dose to betng tiomi»
nattt on Tucsday, But then, who
can blntne them: They were prob»
ably eoneemed about their eity

They were probablyeoneemed
about the dozens of startle who
were pcaccfuily protesting the in-
humane actions oFWTO. under»
going pepper spray and rubber
bullets for a cause. but, those
weren't really Seattle eirizensand at
icast tome erthe protesting wasn't
peaceful.

Used to be, in the NBA, Darryl
oatvlnnswould breekebnekboerd
at least once n yesr. Thtsweek the
only glass sltatterring was that of

store tvindptvs wro prorettots
were brettktng

Militant protesters broke err
from the 35,000 pesternl demon.
strntots Tnesdtty, not only smash»
tng windows, but vnnd.
shops, spray—pulnnng obseemnes
tntl setting spot rites.

”Fm very distressed to see vid»
eos oreur beautlrul eity with tenr
gas nnd police dressed in riot gear,"
Mayor Paul sehell said.

I’m sure members orrhe Sonies
felt the same way. The nets orthe
rioters nrtd eonseouent reattion or
the poliee was probably as notice
able as a $5,000 ﬁne. it probably
didn’t even register to the players.

but it did matter for tlte tens
While the players and many orthe
protesters, as evidenced by their
sets erstupidtty, probably couldn't
even 5pc” world Trade Organizr
(ion. rans could not attend this im-
portant cariytscason game.

The violence may ot may not
have undermined open debate, but

it did under.
nttne another

A m c r i c :l n
value; rltnt or
taking Junior
to the basket-
ball gnme,

A n t i -
WTO rotees
are united by
n profound
mistrust or
globslteenon.
The lss-nation trade body, which
sets and enretees rules for interna.
tional commerce, has come under
attack as e bureaemey that supports
multinational eerporauons while
the workers the poor. the environ
ment and the rest orthe world all
stirrer.

ldon't really know enough, and
haven’t removed myselrrrom the
couch to educate myselron the subs
test. to make a yudgemenr about
whether the cause rot protest is iust.

The acts of the riot-
ers and consequent re.-
action of the police was
probably as noticeable
as a $5,000 fine. It
probably didn’t even
register to the players.

I do believe now, after these
protests, which were erreenve in
shutting down theeity, thatviolent
protest IS the way to go. It has to
be more erreenve than dressing up
in bunny outﬁts or tree costumes.

Protesters, though, need to re»
aiizc they have a negative street on
more than what they are protesting
against. rash orthem should look
into the depths or their souls and
saty, “Is it worth it, to disrupt sueh
important events as NBA garnet?"
