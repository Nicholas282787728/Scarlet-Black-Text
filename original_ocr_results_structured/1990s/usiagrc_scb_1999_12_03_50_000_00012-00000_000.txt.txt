The weekend before Thanksgiving rhiee earloads of Grinnellums uaveled down in

Ofthc rhree cars which Grinnellians rook down, only one came back,

The one rhar rerurned, or course. was full otpeuple who. {or one son or anoihei,

The oLher ear was one I had borrowed from a friend. 1r overheared before arriving in
GeorgiaWhile in Columbus, it was repaired ro rhe rune af$300. 1r larer broke down again

Larry did a $500 job on rhe ear, whieh involved wairing an cxtrzt day for a radiaror ro be

Dear Wound,

I am a ﬁrst-year student, and I think I have a
problem. rm always tired and ohen fall asleep in
class. I can’t even stay awake to do homework,
Since fall break, I have been pretty much coma-
tosc. Do you think it’s because I’m stupid or lazy?
Or maybe I have a sleeping disorder and should
see a doctor? I don’t know what‘s wrong with me.

Dear \Wounda

I feel that my time in ofﬁce has been quite
successful thus far. I’m working with a group of
talented people on the Campus Master Plan, and
our funds are pretty much unlimited as we have
a billion—dollar- endowment. Yet, despite all this,
the Trustees are still pressuring me about creat-
ing the perfect college. Frankly, I’m growing
pretty tired of their bitching. What should I
do?

.. President Osgood
