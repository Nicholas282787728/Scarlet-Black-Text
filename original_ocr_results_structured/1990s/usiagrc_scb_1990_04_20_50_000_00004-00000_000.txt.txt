Psychology Research
Applies to Real Life

By Ann Treistrnan

The idea of psychology research
often conjures up images of rats-
bcedyveyed rats racing around in
wooden mazes while their white
coated observers comment on their
activity. After all. these experi
ments are conducted. And though
they are often extraordinarily ef-
fective in discovering traits or char,
acteristics of human beings, it is
sometimes hard toconnect real life
with raLs in our minds.

Colin Sacks is teaching his stur
dcnts that research is intrinsically
connected to real life.

“I like doing research because it
is theoretically interesting and it
has very real and important appli-
cations," said Sacks. He is cur-
rently working with Mark Saint-
Andre and David Evans to explore
learned helplessness in young chil-
dren.

The research may help clcmcnr
tary school teachers and principals
weed out children who are future
targets for depression. In adults,
learned helplessness is, "a certain
way of viewing the world." Sacks

explained thatpcopleexperiencing. .

learned helplessness "blame them-
selves when things go wrong and
don’t give themselves credit when
things go right.“ This can lead to a
depressive reaction. Sacks ex
plained that prior research has
shown that these people give off
”weird, non-verbal behavior lead-
ing to rejection in social situations
which only exacerbates the depres-
sion.”

To ﬁnd out whether young chil-
dren follow these same patterns.
Sacks, Saint Andre, and Evans are
examining 3 to 5 year-old children.
They are testing to see whether the
pcrserverattce of helpless children
is lower than that of non»helpless
children, as is the case with adults.

The children are shown pictures
of situations: parents fighting, for
example. Then they are shown
some pictures depicting scenes
which may have occurred before
the fight. ln some, the child is
breaking something, or hitting a
sibling, or doing another action
which his/herparents would disap-
prove of. In others, one of the
parentsishavingabaddaycrbcing
arrested, or participating in some
sort of upsetting action. The child

suffenngfrom learned helplessness
is more likely to blame his/herself
for the light.

Although data are still being
collected. Sacks is very excited
about the practical applications of
the project. He commented that an
awareness of this phenomenon by
teachers ofyoung children can lead
them to encouragekids not to blame
themselves and to take credit for
what they accomplish. _

In a seperate study, Sacks’ ad-
vanced research students are trying
to discover why some people elicit
negative responses in social situ-
ations. He said,“lt’s notclearwhat
depressive behaviorsaverbal or
nonverbal—elicit the response"

The class designed a study using
vignettes of situations in which
hypothetical conversations take
place. The way of speaking is
describedi loud, quiet, average,
mumbling. The reader is also told
where the speaker‘s eyes are fo-
cused andinfonnedofthespeaker‘s
body language. The study was
designed to see whether the way a
person says something is as impor-
tant as what the person says.

Well, Sacks summed up the

group findings as “lt‘ s not what
you say, so much as how you say
it" He added, “Further analysis
showed that we don‘t accept or
reject people on how happy or sad
they make us, but on how viable a
social entity we think that they will
be in the future.”

He explained that a person‘s
“future value" is inferred through
their non~verbal actions such as
body language, eye»contact, and
voice tension. The depressed per-
son wouldn‘t be rejected because
he/shedepressesotlters.butbecause
others might not see them as a part
ofa successful social future, Ifcli-
nicians could help people try to
reverse these nonverbal behaviors,
the rejection might not occur.

Sacks also commented that,
“Previous research has suggested
that individuals are particularly
rejecting ot‘ opposite-sex individu-
als whom they perceive as de-
pressed. This has been found to be
especially so for females respond~
ing to depressed male targets. We
tested both male and female sub-
jecLs and targets, and failed to rep»

ences in psychology, Maracck’s

tions behind this research. She
argues that scholars who look for
differences in men’s and wo-
men's behavior wtll find them,
and those who lookjfor similarities
will ﬁnd them. Maracek suggests
that researchers examine, lnsteati.
the underlying causes of these
differences and similarities, fo-
cusing especially on the unequal
distribution of power in society.
This concept explains psycho—
