Tales From Another World

BY DAVE FRIEDMAN
Columnist

A gray day for many days and a
long night turns lonely. Melissa lies
in bed searching for strength,
strength enough not to cry. Her
roommate snores in rhythm to the
bass thumping in from next door.
Melissa runs her right hand up her
left artn and remembers a touch. She
closes her eyes and sees a different
scene. The snoring is replaced by
silence and the thumping comes from
her excited heart. Another hand is
on her arm, moving slowly up and
down, pushing up her shirt sleeves
and sliding down below her elbows.
It is a dream come true, the reality of
the memory. It is the moment she
imagined years ago before even ap-
plying to college, when she still dated
boys and first realized she wanted
men.

In the shadowed light of his room,
every inch of it foreign, she felt her
self a lover. Looking into his eyes,
she felt that she understood, and liSr
tening to his words, spoken softly
into the nape of her neck, she felt
beautiful. His hand slid from her arm
to her waist and then smoothly
against her skin and under her shin.
She nearly collapsed from ecstasy,
“Can this really be happening?" she
thought, but took no time to answer.
They collapsed together against the
wail‘then onto the floor. What was
happening happened and Melissa
had a door opened to her.

It had been a week and, now, lay-
ing in bed she stared through that
door and wondered if she could go
back. She was scared, it was dark
and she didn't know her way around.
And if she hadjust one person to help
her, she thought, just one person and
she'd be fine. It‘s being alone that

makes it hurt. It's being alorle that
makes it so frightening She had
asked him to take her there. She hlid

had laughed at his jokes, smiled at
his gaze, and made the iriost obvi-
ous of gestures to bring llrrn to her
He was a dream for her tlteii, titid he
still was, only now she was begin
ning to understand that he was her
dream, and that she had coitstructcd
it all. '

In the darkness she could see tltc
way things moved, slithery creatures
made their way through dank halls,
brushing up against stranger’s legs,
feeling their way through the night
She realized that this dliikiicss nas
ongoing, that it existed on both sides
of the door, only on this side everyr
one seemed more aware of It. Sonic
fled from the light while others tried
to bathe in it. Melissa didn't know
where to go so she remained still and
desperately tried to make clear all
that she saw. She saw her lover from
memory and tried to force him into
the light, to expose him for her eyes
and all the other eyes squinting, ti'yr
ing to make out what is and what is
imagined.

there is no life without them Pcrr

Where Have Our Voices
Gone? '

BY ERIN HUSTiNGs
Editor-in—Chief

Among my friends, there have been
many discussions this semester about
how Grinnell has changed since we
were freshman. Seniors are bound
to be a little bit disillusioned, rest-
less, tired of being in school and of
putting off what we really want to
do with our lives. However. there
are many legitimate clues indicating
that the character of the Grinnell stu-
dent body has evolved. The-case in
point — since the beginning of the
semester, the Scarlet & Black has
received only four letters to the edi-
(01',

Do students not have opinions any
more, before the seeds of appropri—
ate thoughts are implanted in their
minds by leamed professors? In past
years, most issues of the Scarlet &
Black contained a page. or even
more, of letters to the editor. This
semester, we have practically begged
for letters, and to no avail,

Idon't claim to be truly in touch
with campus life, and so I may be
mistaken, but it seems to me that stun
dents are more ready than ever be
fore to accept the status quo, the story
the “adults" tell them. What about
the Labor Day issue? In almost ev»
ery way possible, this institution
downplays the importance and the
dignity of the working class. When
was the last time popular literature
or wisdom was treated with the same
respect as educated, academic work
in one of your classes? When was
the last time Grinnell offered a class

on 3 Labor movement that involved
reading and leaining from the words
and feelings of the participants, not
the analyses of Harvard professor-s:l
Students can and should be doing
something about that 7 we are
adults — but no one seems to care
enough to follow up on the thought.

What about the cvcrtts to which no
one at all responded? Most or you
can vote, but you can't legally buy
alcohol, and the state orowujusI rc-
soundingly reinforced this rule
Does anyone care? The Minority
Scholars in Residence Program may
do positive things, but should we
need it in the ﬁrst place'! Wlly can I
practically count on my two hands
the number of Grinnell professors
who are peopic of color'7 Does
care?

The fact that Ihc Scarlet & Black
has not received many letters to the
editor is only one indication of the
apathy I feel has spread over our
campus. It may be that the l’ault is
on our part, and the newspapersome
how falls to fullill what Iconsidcr ltl
be one of its most important lunar
tions, to be a forum for political and
social debate on campus. However,
if this rs the case, the fact remains
that no one has even bothered to ca-
press that opinion!

ihopc Griniicllians will prove me
wrong and begin to respond as llit‘
thoughtful adults we should be to
what is going on aioutid its. Until
this happens, howcvcr. I ciin only

The Importance Of Don’t Ask Me, I’m Just a Girl
Free Condoms

BY IVV CHANG
Columnist

Oncc upon ri time, two girls dccidcti
to leave civilization and go to col-
logo in the Midwest. Amid lnany
Jokes concerning corniicids, eticli
packed her bl!“ - to prcprirc tor a new
life in lowti...iini...l mean .in... uln
.. a small riirdwcstcrn state

These two girls arrived at college
to discover a blue pamphlet with a
cheesy trtlc taped to their door, Yes,
their door, for these two girls were
to be rootiinialcs, and the cheesy hluc
pamphlet wax to be their guide lor
the duration at their cohabitation,

In the Confusion ol’ the move-in,
howcvci, the pamphlet. important as
it was, was somehow forgotten
(imagine that!), but its catchy title
would forever stick in their heads—
Built/mg RomitmtI/c Relations.

That night. the two roommates at-
tended a ﬂoorinecting wrtll their SA,
who told them, among other things,
that two free condoms or dental dalns
were available iii the Health Center
each day. In I‘act, their SA told therri
that not only were livo free condoms
or dental dams available ill the
Health Center. bill that they were
available melt this, every day the
Health Center was open. This was the
first of ultirn times the girls would
be told this, ‘

A Iew days later, the roommates
were walking out of the dining hall
lifter eating lunch together, as loom-
mates often tlo. when they decided
that they would venture to the Health
Center and take advantage of their
$24,000 condoms. So off to the
health center they went. where they
were each given it choice or dental
dams, condoms with spctmicide, or
condoms withoill spcntticrde Then,
with condoms in hand, they skipped
riicr-riiy home.

The next day, the roommates den
cidcd to visit their friendly college
Health Center again. Again, they
were each discreetly given a choice
of dental dams, condoms with Spare
micidc, orcondoms without spermir
erde Again, the girls left the Health
Center with condoms in hand, and

EXCELLENT

skipped merrily home

The Health Center was such a con»
venicnt stop aflcr lunch that thc
roommates decided to make this their
daily roommate bonding activity.
Though they had never been able to
find that darn blue pamphlet, they
were sure that their daily trips helped
build their "roommate relation ‘

And so they continued their daily
visits.

The roommates might have lived
happily ever after, except one day,
their friendly College Health Center
became not so friendly Instead of
handing them each two condoms, the
woman at the frontdeskcalled them
over to talk to her

“Well, gills," she said, "I need to
know...tirc you using these condoms
for purposes other than what they‘re
intended for? or are you passing them
out?" The two girls looked at each
other, unsure of exactly what the
woman was trying to imply, and
slowly shook their heads no. The
Health Center had been weird once
before, asking them to write down
their ID numbers even though that
policy had been phased out last year.
Maybe this was one of those things.

“Well, you know," the woman cone
tinued, ,you‘re not really supposed
to come here cvcryriay. The college
doesn‘t want that. It’sJust supposed
to be in case of emergencies, you
know, to tide you over, Here are your
Condomsfortoday, but thlsshouldn't
be an everyday thing. That's not what
this is intended for."

The roommates walked back to
their room in stunned silence. Had
they been deceived? Hadn‘t various
figures of authority on campus res
peatedly told them that condoms
could be received, two a day, every
(lay? Even more importantly, what
would become of their daily room-
mate bonding activity7And, as a re-
sult. their relationship?

That remains to be seen. One thing
we know for sure, the roommates’
relationship would never be the

I need to exercise.

Ismcll really bad.

Is there a cure for a hangover?

The pizza Ijust ate is going to make
me fat.
