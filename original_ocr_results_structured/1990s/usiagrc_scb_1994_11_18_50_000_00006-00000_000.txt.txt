Opinion

Democracy Requires Participation

incc the clcction last Tuesday,
S numerous Grinnelllans have
cxprcssed concern and disapr
pcintment over [he outcome. Iccr-
thinly share that concern for our nns
tion and for thc future of free and
open thought. However, I do not
understand lhc complaints that I am
hearing from people who did not even
exercise their right to vote in that
election.
Nearly 300 students registered
to vote here in Grinnell; of those, a
little over 200 actually voted, While
we did beat the national average for
voter turnout, 70% turnout is a very
poor showing for a campus which
claims to be very socially conscious.
Considering the case of voting here
at Grinncll, anything short of 100%
voter participation is quite unncccpls
able. Everyonc registered here had
the opportunity to vote on campus
the Saturday before the election; on
Election Day, shuttles were running
to thc polls every few minutes. The

campus media did an cxccllcntjob of
informing the campus community

about the issues and the candidates;
many of thc candidates (even those
running for stateswide ofﬁce) visited
the campus to meet with students.
Simply put, there is no excuse for not
being informed, and for not voting.

For those who were registered
ouroﬂslate, the opportunity to cast
an absentee ballot was readily avail-
able. Ifyou happened to forget, you
could have easily registered here in
Grinnell. Voter registration cards
wercavallablcintthorumandwere
even made available in the most of
the residence halls.

Grinncll College likes to claim a
high degree or social awareness and
activny among its students. How can
we make this claim if people aren‘t
even willing to vote? Surely we all
realize that living in a democratic
socicty carries a certain responsibile
ity for all citizens. The most basic of
these responsibilities is voting for
our government's leaders,

Our age group is taking a lot of
heat for being apathetic and cynical
about our society and government.
We’ve been labeled as “unlikely to
vote", and given last priority with
both political parties in their efforts
to get out the Volt: and in recruiting
activists. If we are going to over
come the Generation X stcreotypc
that we've been given, we are going

gratulations and thank you. You did
your part. This election is now part of
history. nothing can change the out-
come. However, we can learn a num~
bet oflessons from the results, Ifwc
hope to hdvc a say in our nation and
its government, we mustmnkc nCOli’lr

place to start is wtth the basic demos
cratic act of voting.

The Truth About Wok

still not been determined, although
many ofthc chemicals can safely be
labeled carcinogens.

If you eat in one of ihe dining
halls on a wok night, you're notjust
eating » you‘re also smoking. You
might as well be holding a Marlboro
in one hand and a fork in the other,
inhaling between bilﬁs,

Presently our dining halls have
no extraction system for the smoke
generated by cooking Woks. If you
walk into any stirsfry restaurant that
is licensed for public dining, the first
thing you would see over a similar
opensfnced cooking arrangementisa
towering hood designed to remove
harmful and unpleasant smoke. Al-
though the situation is better in Quad
due to its high vaulted ceiling, the
disperse haze you see ill the dining
halls on wok nights is a sign that the
dining halls lack adequate ventllnr
tion. Lack of propcr vcntilation crcs
ales smoke with a "high tenacity
level." Aftcr ﬁve minutes in the dlns
ing hall, especially Cowles, cvcry
strand of every piece of clothing is
saturated with Ihe hcnvy smell of
combusted all. The alvcoli ill your
lungs are in no doubt weighed down

It‘s a well known fact that the

by inhaling this tainted alt, lhc pea-
llut oil and soy that you use to cook
with is chemically altered when it
assaults the body via the lungs, The

surely agitated. if not caused by,
breathing air of such poor quality.
Some of you may think this is
going overboard, but placing a pre-
mininoii air quality in thedininghall
is of vast importance Wc endanger
ourselves by overlooking small den
iails like this, Taking for granted ihc

it's no secret that by buying raw
goods in bulk and forcing unpaid
students to cook for themselves, the
administration is saving money. But
they're also screwing over our health
over too, Professor James Kissane oi
the English department once told me
that just after World War 11, Lucky
Strike annually sponsored a Cowles
Smoker , a party where small four
packs of cigarettes were handed out
to male students in the hopes ofpcr—
suading them to take up smoking.
