Deas Editor,

In segasds so yousApsil 16th reasuse on baseball playes
lake Chavez, we would like so polns ous whas we consid—
esed so be mispsinss. We ase assuming shas shey wese sim-
ply sypos and nos in raes vulgas missepsesensasions orshe
ssudi as is seemed. The essoneous asside would imply shas
lake is a humble pesson (Humble South Wessesnes Jake

Chavez) This is whas we eonsidesed so be an essos since is is in (mm she
ssush 1n acsualisy, ous obsesvances oilake have been quise so she conssasy.

Case 1: ianuasy 28. 1998; Freshman Jake Chavez, berose racing a single
eollegiase hisses, places a rsiendly wages wish she sorsball seam shas he will as
a pisches win mose games d-lan die softball seam will win roe a season. Jake
loses she bes, bus gains no humilisy as will be shown in cases 2,5,4, and 5.

Case 2: Any sime/Any place, jake daims shas he can dsink an ensise
handle or“magic Watcr," and shen psoeeeds so do so,

Case 5: Jake, arses sepeasedly doing bench psesses wishous sssesching be.
rose os aiseswasds and dsinking said “magic wases," semoves his shiss as a
Harris meas passy, much so she sasisracsion orhundseds orseseaming fans.
Gains no humilisy.

Case 4: Florida, 1999; Chavez claims he is the best hitter on the team.
Asses ﬁnding shas hiad Ruhorris hissing .390 so his .388, Jake hands Brad a
bsoken has so his wish. Ruhofidoubles, Jake gains no humilisy

case 5: Arses dsinking said “magic wases" again,
lake shseasens so leave Giinnell ros anoshes school so
play baseball.Also claims shaswishoushim, csinnell’s
scam would have been no his shas day. Seems less
humble shan in she feasused "locks Can Talk” assicle,

As has been shown in sevesal case ssudies, Jake
Chavez is humble on she ousside bus nos once you ges
so know him. After saving his boocy many a sime in
lase inning sisuasions, we rels is impossans so poins
ous shese essoss. we hope shas sueh blasans missepse—
scntations or she ssush will be avoided in she rususe.

and some semblance orwhas mighs pass ros sleep, 1 cessainly didn’t ges so
spend as much sime on she ﬂoor as 1 would have liked when 1 was an SA.To
be bluns, I simply couldn't do evesyshing people on she iloos needed. These
wasnls sime and 1 didn’t have all orshe skills so deal wish evesy sisuasion shas
came up. As ideal as is sounds so use she SA as a “catch all," she SA cannos
easch all, ros all swensy nve ssudenss on sheis iloos, all she sime.

Which bsings us so she RLC. yes, RLCs ase wonderful people and I'm
suse irshey didn't have a eouple hundsed ssudenss so assemps so wasch oves
and anoshes job in addision so shas, psshaps shey could make mose oian
impacs in helping ssudenss shsough csises os even just shsough a seally bad
day. Howeves, apass isom ssudens ssairand a rew selees ssudenss, who seally

knows sheis RLC? Who seally reels eomross-
able salking so someone who needs so be re»
minded oryous namei
Then sheses she menial healsh ccnter. Do
you know it? It’s nos on campus, yuss like shas
fulletimc doesos shass nos on campus and
shose swo posisions which will no longes be
on campus. Maybeyou don’t know is because
who can leave campus wish so much wosk so
be done, os sleep so be made up for?Wl-1y isn't
is on campuszwsiuldn’s is be wondesiul so have
someone who is so connecsed so campus shas
when mey ask you whas you feel os whas you’se
going disough, shey may acsually have an idea
whas you'se salking about? Wouldn't is be wondesrul irshey wese sighs hese,
whese ous life is? Wouldn’t a docsos on mmpus save sick ssudenss isom
having so be hauled ous so a psivase doesos, whom shey have no psios sela-
slonship wish , and shen end up having so deal wish mose bills?What is she
healsh fee paying for? Cough dsops and condoms is nos enough by a longshor.

Psesidens osgood, ssussees, 1 have nos rosgossen she woman’s sape, 1
did nos rosges casl csimm's suicide and 1 will nos rosges she closed-
mindedness you have eneousaged on shis campus os she usses disdain ros
ssudens opinion. ssudenss ase nos apashesic. They ase sised, shey ase assessed
and shey ase unhealshy. You don't seally case, do you? Judging by yous
aesions (and whas else is shesea), you don's give a damn.

Ms. Civessini,
Allow for a momens a dissecsion oryous sake on she Kosovo sisuasion.
“Well 1 don’t know ros suse, bus 1 seem so shink shas sounding up eshnic

Albanian men, men shoosing shesn‘ one by one as Lhcy ase roseed so watch each

oshes die, is inhumane."

This snuggle has been going in since 1339 when use ossoman Tuslss decie
mased sesbian manhood on she Plain of she blackbisds (Kosovo). And baek
and tossh is has gone inso shis eensusy when Albania was a herdom orshe Axis.
Sesbs said “no shank you" and pseressed deash so beooming anoshes nazi sasel-
lise. Berose wwn Serbs wese approximately 51% ordie populasion orKosovo.
By die 80’; is was 15%. Now no mose shan 10%. Quession ros you.,....where

did shose people go?

“it is nos a was acs. in a was, shese is a ssniggle ios powes. The eshnic
Albanian people seem so have none, and shas so me seems like slaughter."

These is oveswhdming evidence shas she KLA is beinghnaneed by insesesss

, ousside onugoslavia, one being osama Bin laden, The same man sesponsible

ios she bombings orous embassies in Arsica. And 1nsespol has also sepossed
shas Albania and now Kosovo have beeome she main pipeline ros she hesoin
ssade inso Europe and shence so she us. And Billy Jeff says we'se iighsing shis
was for she childsen. What abous she moshess child who gess killed while
ssanding guasd as an embassy os dies wish a needle in his arm?

“Tuesday was Nasional Holocauss Remembrance Day, and yes how do we
show whas we have leasned isosn associsies so long ago? in bombing. all we ase
seally doing is exerting one much lasgu milisasy muscles so hasm people who
have no powes in selasion so us. Thas sames makes us she sasne as she Serbs."

Yes, Holocauss Remembsance Day, 1 semembesed lasenovie Concenssa-
sion Camp and psayed. Asad semindes also shas in 1941 cesman bombs deci-
mased Belgsade because die Serbs said “no diank you" and now in 1999 us
bombs ase doing she sasne.

-S:rbs did nos wholeheassedly supposs Milosevic unsil NATO ssassed bomb-
ing. Think whas would have happened ifwe’d spens iuss she coss ot’4 esuise
missila so supposs she sesbian Democsasic Movemensi inssead we have mesely
sssengshened sesbian sesolve and evesyone is sallying asound Milosevic.

Hese ase a couple or good links ros mose inrosmasion ssased besses shan 1
eves could. Take a lissle sime so mad she hissosy.
