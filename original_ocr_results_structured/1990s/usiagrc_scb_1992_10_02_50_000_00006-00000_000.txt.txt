Reid discussesthe US hacelthare

 

by Evan L. Reid

America is the only indusu-iallzcd society in the world that requires its citizens to own auto insurance, but
neither requires norprovides health insurance for those citizens. The “health care crisis," which currently occupies
so much space in the American newspapers and magazines. is actually a group ofsmaller, related issues. Growing
insuranceprcmiums. doctorand nurse shortages, rising medical fees. and the increasing inability by some toachievc
access to needed technology, have soured a great majority of Americans on the current. market-driven medical care
delivery system in this country. In many polls, lopsided majorities of people, even thoseideniifying themselves as
upper class, are expressing frustration with the slow paccofreform in the medical field. This frustration also seems
to cut across all income and ethnic categories.

Younger Americans are frequently raising their voices in this growing national debate. Many recent college
graduates are faced witlr the realization that fewer than 50 per cent ofemployers offer full medical beneﬁts as part
of their compensation packages. Beginning employees are having to make a choice between the enormous burden
placed on an encry»level salary by burgeoning insurance costs, and the risk of carrying no insurance The picture
can be even bleaker for those who pursue graduate studies or a career in nonprofit enterprises.

Why have insurance rates skyrocketed in recent years? There are dozens of answers. In short, the rapid pace
of advance in medical technology, coupled with the growth of specialization in medicine. have made the business
of health increasingly expensive. Your general practitioner can give you a physical, but if she or he is uncertain
about a particular symptom you might have, chances are you will be referred to a specialist, a practice encouraged
by the American Medical Association, and the costs will pile up. If you have an old-fashioned insurance plan. the
company will pay all your bills after you pay a standard deductible. This practice has become prohibitively
expensive for employers in recent years as specialism have multiplied. Many companies, even giant corporations
like General Motors. are finding meir profitability squeezed by health care costs for their employees. During the
last two decades. the medical price index, the average cost of medical care, has risen much faster than the average
rate of inﬂation. As prices rise. the insurance companim must raise your premiums to remain profitable.

Beyond the costof the specialists, the insurance company must meet the enormous overhead of keeping track
of all the doctors and tests. This paperwork is responsible for more than one quarmr of the increases in insurance
premiums during the 19805. In addition, pharmaceutical companies have been getting into the act of lateby hiking,
sharply, the costs of their most popular prescription drugs. Specialization is an easy culprit to identify. Other
problems, such as the terrible shortage of trained physicians have served to place health care at a premium in those
areas. Regardless of the plethora of specialists that can be found at any major hospital. the beds in those hospitals
are often empty.

The American health care system has progressed technologically to the point that hospital stays have become
unnecessary in many instances. Hospitals therefore have begun to charge more for their remaining patients to
compensate for the lost business. Many hospitals have been caught padding bills, adding hidden or erroneous
charges. a practice that passes their losses on to the insurance companies.

Vice President Dan Quayle has spent much of this election year talking about an issue that would only seem
to affect health care peripherally: legal reform. However. the business of lawsuits and malpractice insurance tuve
grown hand-in-hand with the new equipment and complicated treatments. Juries have proven to be very
sympathetic to malpractice complaints. and multi-million dollar awards are rewarded with great frequency.
Insurance companies have subsequently had to raise malpractice insurance [xemirrms for doctors, who in turn pass
the increased cost along to their patients. Although Quayle has not made this speciﬁc argument, it is possible that
his plan for reforming our litigation systemmight help ameliorate this expensive addition to America‘smedical bill.

Driven by increased costs, medical fees and insurance premiums have spiraled upward. The result has been
that America has the most advanced health care system in the world. except that it’s too expensive for Proposals
to change the system range from the incremental reforms, such as Congress’ controversial attempt in the late 1980s
to guarantee that catastrophic illness wouldn’t bankrupt families, to the sweeping proposals for a radical departure
from our marketvbased medical system, In her bid for the U.S. Senate in Iowa, Jean Lloyd-Jones has advocated a
“single-payer" system. This plan, currently in effect in Canada, would nearly eliminate private insurance, and
government would pay all health care expenses incurred by its citizens,

GeorgeBush‘s reformplan is a model ofincremenralism. Theplan‘s prime feature is aprovisiorr through which
those with no insurance would be able to write the cost of premiums of f their income tax. If they paid no tax, then
the difference would be paid to them by the federal government. Bill Clinton’s plan falls somewhere between
incrementalism and sweeping change. His plan has been dubbed “play»or-pay.” Employers would be required to
provide health insurance to their employees. If they did not “play,” they would be compelled to “pay” into It
government pool that would pay to insure those without coverage.

All three plans, the Canadian,

have come under sharp criticism.
Critics of the single—payer proposal

verely limited titan in the United States. In addition. Canada has gone
seriously into debt to meet its obligations as the Nation's solo health insurer.
Currently, its pct caprla debt is higher than that held by the U.S. Bush has
attacked the Clinton proposal, saying the Arkansas governor wants to create
a new federal bureaucracy that would “combine the efficiency of the House
Post Office with the compassion of the KGB.” Clinton has ridiculed
Bush’s design as being too little too late.

Beyond the unfocused plans of Bush and Clinton. in the U.S. only
Hawaii and Oregon have any practical expericnce in health care reform,
Oregon, in an attempt to extend Medicare and Medicaid benefits to the
uninsured working poor, has devised a plan to ration the services provided
by these fedemlly-fundcd programs. The Bush Administration, in a move
Oregon Governor Barbara Roberts believes to be a cynical, election year
ploy, has withheld approval for the Oregon Plan, citing concems for
disabled citizens of the state.

The fundamental weaknms of most reform plans is that they fail to
address every pieceof the health carepuzzle. Despite thetitleof"socialized
medicine" often attached to the universal plan, the Canadians have yet to
successfully control the cost of most medical treatments. Bill Clinton and
George Bush are especially vague when they discuss cracking down
on the inflationary practices of some medical professionals. The media, as
evidenced byaprece suchas this, have toolittlc space to describe every facet
of the troubled mosaic of American health care. Oregon, alone, has had the
courage to address this “crisis” in a calm, orderly fmhion, treating health
care less as a vole—getting tool and moreas a genuinepublic policy concern.
In that respect, Oregon may be a model the rest of the nation may soon
choose to emulate.

Horn F655 on state police

After a tragedy strikes, I just want to scream at the top of my lungs,
“Learn from this!" Sometimes people will listen. Recently, a woman was
murdered and her baby was put in serious danger when her car was hijacked.
Congress has heard thecall and isworking to enact tougher penalties for car-
hijackers. President George Bush has even suggested that these criminals
get. the death penalty if the victim is killed in the process.

Grinnell College has recently been struck by tragedy. Unfortunately, in
some ways, the lesson has not been learned. I have a car on campus. After
the Tammy Zywicki tragedy. my parents got paranoid and bought me a car
phone. I learned not to drive alone and not to accept rides from strangers if
my car does break down. I consider myself relatively safe.

I decided to go back home to the Nonhwest suburbs of Chicago last
weekend. My friend lim lives in Chicago and agreed to make the trip with
me. We left Friday evening. We had been driving for over two hours and
had reached 1-88 in Illinois. It was then, as I was accelerating, my carslipped
out of gear. I deceleratcd (I drive an automatic), but the car refused to get
in gear. lpulled the car over.

There was no need for panic. I used the earphone to dial 91 l. I told the
gentleman on the other line that we were having trouble and that we were on
1-88 at the 64 mile marker heading eastbound. He told me that they would
send a dispatcher right away. So Jim and I warted.

A bus pulled over. The bus driver offered us a ride to the nextlollbooth.
Fearful of strangers and confident that the police would save us, we turned
the bus drrvcr down. We waited some more. The sun went down, and it was
dark. We waited 40 minutes. No cop came. In frustration, I started my car
again. It worked and we were on our way again.

This short and relatively unimportant event illustrates a more important
point. The Zywicki tragedy was unfortunate, butl learned a lot from it. The
police haven’t. One would think that having a person murdered in their state

would make a police department parv
