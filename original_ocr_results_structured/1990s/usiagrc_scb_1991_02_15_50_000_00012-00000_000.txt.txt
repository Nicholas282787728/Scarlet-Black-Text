A Mad Dog swims the freestyle in last Saturday's State meet held at Loras College

Dogs hindered by illness, injury

By Steve Clem

The Mad Dogs battled off atlr
mentsandinjuriesinlastweckend‘s
Iowa state small college meet to
continue their unbeaten slate meet
record alive. The meet1 which was
held at Dubuque's Lnras College,
showed the tremendous depth and
adaptabilty theMad Dogs hold,The
Pioneers defeated second-place
Luther by the score of 5605-460.

"We are not in perfect health
right now", says Coach Ray
Oben'nillert Obermiller pointedout
that he was pleased with a win from
a squad with illnesses and injuries.
“A lot of the sick people just have
colds and weaknesses. The injuries
aremostly minor shoulderand knee
problems,“ said Obermiller.

Oben'niiler cited a number of
swimmers as having a good meet.
“Luther Davis won both the 50 and
100 freestryles. and had agreatsplit
in a second-place relay despite a
slight muscle pull. Ofcourse Dave

Ressner and Joe Zimscn had great
meets. And ChrisLiu swam theZOO
back for the second time and
dropped about 7 seconds off his
prior time to finish second," said
Obermiller. Obermiller also was
pleased with the performances of
Eric Sandeen, Doug Murphy, and
Scott Truelove, whose time in the
200 breast (2: 16.7) wasjust offthe
school record.

The Dogs ended up switching
swimmers around atthelastminute
in order to ﬁll holes left by sick
teammembers. Zimsen entered the
200 free at the last moment, and
cameaway victorious. Victories like
Zimsen‘s proved the Mad Dogs’
ability to swim more than just one
niche of events.

The Mad Dogs were also fortu-
nate enough to earn a Division III
Academic All~American award for
overall team GPA. The members

Last night the Dogs hosted

“You never want to go into
anything taking it for granted, I
learned that years ago. If we can
get healthy in time, we are in
really good shape,“ Obenniller
said, adding ”Thursday, Febru~
ary 28 is when it all begins. That
is the whole season wrapped up
in a nutshell.”
