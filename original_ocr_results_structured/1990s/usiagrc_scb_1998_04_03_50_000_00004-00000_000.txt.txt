We never thought we could eat too
much grease. But then we went to
Dairy Queen. Erin can generally
consume her weight in breading, but
even she had a hard time swallow-
ing the stuff we ordered. The grease
factor merited a 14 napkin rating.

As for the atmosphere, the match-
ing newlycremodeled interior and
workers' uniforms were a pleasing
sight to behold for fashionrconscious
Erin. And we were both honored by
the cook’s personal presentation of
our meal in the secluded (practically
romantic) dining room. Sadly, the
elevator muzak circa 1972 mined the
amorous mood.

While we were not in the mood for
lovin‘ (the cook declined our offers),
we were deﬁnitely in the mood for
some eats. We found that the pizza
burger and pork fritter could be
lumped into the same general cat-
egory: inedible. The pizza burger
might have been more palatable had
it not been for the pizza and the
burger. The pork fritter. . .well, all
we could say was “Whoomp, there
it is."

Erin ate only the rings of the onion
rings, leaving the onions lying limply
on her tray, much like the worms that
sprawled on the sidewalk during this
week’s rain.

On to the cheeseballs. Mmmmm.

In an attempt to lessen the intake
of indigestible fatty items, we tried
a healthy grilled option. Rebecca did
not believe that the Spicy Southwest
Grilled Chicken Sandwich really
came from the southwest. In her
words, “I was just in tile southwest,
goddammit, and it didn’t taste like
this." The only spice we could iden-
tify was pepper. Although we are by
no means culinary experts? oh,
wait, yes we arei pepper is a SEA:
SONING. Not a spice. The spices,
as we all know, are Ginger, Sporty,
Posh. Scary, and Baby. We con»

cluded, however, that the sandwich
could be identiﬁed as Scary.

Despite our insatiate thirst for meat,
we found the sandwich‘s circular
rings ofbacon-like substance to be a
bit more than We could chew and
definitely too much to swallow.
Rebecca did enjoy the lettuce, al-
though she complained that it was
warm. This. for some reason, was a
surprise to her, Multiple sips of the
pseudoralcoholic Boone‘s Kiwi—
Strawberry Communist Tree-Huge
ging Mr. Misty, however, made her
less cranky. But it is hard to make
her more cranky. “It was like bar
night on a Monday!" Rebecca noted
gleefully.

Erin agreed. “It‘s like a
liquid.,.which many beverages are."
Rebecca now knows why Erin de-
cided not to. be a philosophy major,
Erin's liquid, the blackberry malt,
was a tasty treat. Unfortunately, con-
suming it required the sucking force
of your average rug doctor. By the
end, Erin had actually consumed her
own cheeks.

What trip to Dairy Queen would be
complete without a desert‘.7 (Ours. We
should have stopped with the grease.)
We tried two royal treats; a straw4
berry Shortcake and a double fudge
sundae. Erin, who stopped talking
about herself only to swallow, was
chastised by Rebecca: “Shut up and
savor," she ordered. And Erin, al-
ways the slave to Rebecca‘s de-
mands, polished off her fudge in si-
lence and then happily displayed the
contents of her mouth to her. Rebeoca
responded by the use of violence.
Ergo, the evening ended.

In sum, we think that Dairy Queen
should have remained an ice cream»
only restaurant as it was when it ﬁrst
opened. The stage is now set for the
ultimate showdown between the two
major ice-cream establishments in
Grinnell. Next week is (happily) the
much celebrated opening of the Dari
Barn! Being the famed food critics
that we are, next week's column will
settle the score once and for all.

I have a very simple message for
everyone today. Something I think is
pretty obvious so I’m only gonna say
it once: vandalizing and stealing
are NOT okay,

Just in case you were wondering,
were experiencing a lapse in good
judgment, needed a quickreview on
morals and values, I wanted to do
you, and the campus at large, a favor
and clear up any possible confusion.

That's all. Nice and easy. In a nut-
shell, Pretty self-explanatory, huh?

In fact, you’re probably wondering
why I'm bringing this up at all, much
less devoting an entire column to it,
when it's something we‘ve all been
told since at least preschool and
hopefully even pre-preschool. Well,
what do you know, I was wondering
the same damn thing. Keep reading
and I’ll be more than happy to ex-
plain.

Please don’t think my motive here
is to educate the Grinnell community
on these issues. I‘m not writing this
column because I think these aren‘t
things we all don‘t know. I honestly
believe that each and every indi-
vidual on this campus knows it’s not
okay to break hall mirrors with chairs
when they’re drunk (or even when
they're not). The same applies to
punching out the panes of glass in
front of fire extinguishers. cracking
glass doors, and breaking toilet seats.

I honestly believe that people know
it‘s not okay to use someone else's
dishes, pots, pans, utensils. what
have you, and leave them dirty in the

sink.

I honestly believe that people know
that it’s not okay to take food that's
not theirs from the public fridges on
each floor of every dorm, especially
if it’s labeled as someone else’s, but
even if it’s not. (Regardless, the point
is, the food is still not yours.)

I honestly believe that people know
all these things and more, and yet
THEY HAPPEN. Repeatedly,
recurringly, persistently, annoyingly
they happen- and people are not
pleased.

People don’t like having their food
stolen. People don’t like having to
wash dishes they were kind enough
to allow you to use. People don‘t like
being woken up in the middle of the
night because drunk people leaving
(or returning from) a party feel like
being destructive. People don't like
having the consequences of someone
else’s irresponsible behavior de-
ducted from their damage deposits.
People want you to realize that there
are consequences to your behavior,
the least of which is their anger.

These features are not going to at-
tractpeople to attend Grinnell. These
are not the juicy tidbits I share when
I am trying to explain what Grinnell

is about. These are not the occur-.

rences the administration cites when
it defends its policy of self-goverr
nanee to the public. I ﬁnd it hard to
believe that anyone takes pride or
pleasure in the fact that these wrongr
doings occur, and Iknow that I'm not
the only one who feels this way.

Students move off campus.

They keep their dishes in their
rooms.

They rent mini-fridges and store
their own food.

They plot ways to poison students
who do take their food. (True story !)

So call them what you will, but the

people are not happy.

Letters

to the editor

Dear Editor,

After reading Aaron Stockham‘s
heart touching letter to the editor in
the last issue of the Scarlet and Black,
I felt as ifI had to “throw one out” to
all of the people I felt I could thank.
This is in no way a mockery of Mr.
Stockham‘s letter although I have to
laugh at him for sliding into home
on the PEC’s very very rubber ﬂoor.

First, I’d like to thank the towns
people of Grinnell for putting up with
the students here on the campus. I
know we all see ourselves as model
citizens, but we are just a bunch of
spoiled brats from the suburbs. At
least that is what a lot of us are. So
if you are not a spoiled brat or are
not from the suburbs this doesn‘t
apply to you. The “townies” have to
deal with us saying, “Yeah, well if it
wasn‘t for our money this place
would suck." Maybe we are right,
but when you want to buy clothes,
CDs, shoes, or anything else you
can’t get at Hy—Vee, Walmart, or the
liquor store, we head to Iowa City or
Des Moines. We demand such a va-
riety of items, and low prices that we
go elsewhere. And you wonder why
some of the people in town are bitter
towards us. Also, look at the basic
layout of this campus. We face in,
and are self contained. The
“townies” only see the backs of our
buildings, but sure as hell can hear

’ our little Dibble parties and such. So,
thank you Grinnell (not the college)
for being tolerant of us during our 4
years in your home.

Second I‘d like to thank the mem-
bers of my current floor, Rawson
2nd. Stan, Josh, Samir, Hudson,
Geoff, Joel, Bob, Aris, Mike, Mar-
tin, Chris, Matt (may he return soon),
and the other shorter Chris. I went
to Disco as sober as a nun, and when
I came back none of them were be-
in g problems. I was expecting to
peel a few of them off the floors and
out of their own dinnets. Instead they
were entertaining and they don't re-
member any of it. Too bad I don't
have a camera.

Third, I’d like to thank the Grinnell
Lacrosse Team. We may be a tough
bunch of guys and girls, but we do
try to have fun. And I would like to

say that because of Aaron
Stockham’s injury we lost him as a
goalie for the rest of the season. I
would list all of the people on our
team, but there are too many and
none of them ever show up to prac-
tices, so I won‘t waste my time.
Fourth, I‘d like to thank Grinnell
College. Because of some twist of
fate they accepted this mediocre high
school student even though he ap-
plied a month late. There aren't
many places that would have even
let me on their campuses, so Grinnell
has made me think there is something

wrong with this place. But isn’t that .

why we all like it?

And fifth, the student body. Iknow
I am committing political suicide by
making the following statements, but
can I really do much worse than 18%
in next year’s vote? No. When I
started here I considered myself a
pretty liberal guy. Now Ihave never
felt worse about being a straight,
white, middle-class, male. I am “the
Man" that everyone says is holding
the world at bay and is oppressing
minorities. Maybe I have done this,
but I only say that because I know
one could say that I do it and I am
not even aware of it. So back to the
students. I was told this place was
liberal and accepting. Only half cor-
rect. If you are Christian you are an
animal. If you are a Republican, you
are socially burned alive on a stake.
Oh wait, and let‘s say you happen to
say stuff like “Hey woman, r11 slap
you ifyou act up again," even injest,
you are going to liberal hell. Where
is the acceptance? I know you say
that the only thing we don‘t accept
is intolerance, but that doesn't seem
to be very consistent. The things that
are different are the things you don‘t
accept, and doesn‘t that make you as
guilty as any god-forsaken conserr
vative? Or by me mentioning God,
have I committed one of your sins?
I suppose I need to be sensitive to
the atheists on campus. Yes sir/
ma‘am.

Okay, if you have made it this far
you are either agreeing with me. or
you want to kill me. Either way, I
can handle it. I am not out to piss
everyone off, but I’d like to point out

how we become so self-absorbed
(myself included) that we forget
about what we really stand for. My
ﬁnal point is this: Want to know why
the dining hall is so expensive? It’s
because every time you get a glass
of juice it costs them between 50
cents and a dollar. So, every time
you throw away juice, you are jack-
ing up the bill dining services has to
pay for your wasteful little habits. In
other words, stop whining about it,
we get a good deal for what we pay
for.

Thank you and good day.
Dan Donaldson ’00

P.S.- If you don‘t like Disco, don't
go. If you do go and you didn’t like
it don‘t complain. You have no right.

An open letter to the Grinnell Stu-
dent Body:

Self-governance as it is practiced
now at Grinnell is a farce. When I
came to Grinnell this past fall as a
ﬁrstayear student, I sensed almost
immediately that there was some-
thing not quite right about the sys-
tem of govemance we had, but not
having any evidence, dismissed this
feeling as wrong. After seeing the
recent SGA elections, I realized the
extent of the problems facing us. the
student body of Grinnell College.
This letter is not a personal attack on
the candidates. Nor am I placing
myself above the charges I am about
to bring. I am only using the elec-
tions as evidence because they are
my only frame of reference.

The apparent apathy of almost half
of the student body is revolting to me.
1 question the reasons almost 600
people had for not voting in the ﬁrst
round of the elections. Does SGA
not affect you? If so, then why were
there not 600 people clamoring for a
different, better system? If you say
that SGA does affect you, then why
did you not care who represents the
Grinnell student body, and therefore
YOU, to the outside world (yes, one
does exist outside the bubble of
Grinnell) and the all-important trusr—
ees?

What disappointed me even more
was the smaller turnout for the sec-
ond round of the voting. I believe

683 people voted for either president
or vice-president. Meaning no dis-
respect to Pelar in whom [have full
conﬁdence, this means that approxi-
mately 395 students decided for all
1300 who will be their representa-
tive for the next year. The system,
as I see it, is self-govemance of the
school by the person who represents
thirty percent of the student body.
What will it take for people to care
about the elections? Will it take a
threat from some higher powers-that—
be to take away our right to govern
ourselves (and, as some only see it,
to live without rules)?

Another complaint of mine that
strikes deeper into the system is the
lack of student input into “self: gov-
ernance. As the system stands now,
a student must either know a repre-
sentative of SGA personally or go
mightily out of their way to have
their concern or even opinion on an
issue known. SGA must be more
accessible to the people it supposedly
represents. Are we looking for
simple solutions? If so, there seems
to be one fairly simple, pain-free so-
lution. One night a week for an hour
or two, have arepresentative of SGA
available in the Forum (or another
central, easily accessible, WELL-
PUBLICIZED IOCation)to hear stu-
dents' input on their recent decisions
or complaints. This does not have
to, and should not, be the same per-
son each week, but should rotate
among I-Iall Senators and SGA Of-
ficers (those who REPRESENT us).
We need to have more and better
communication between our repre-
sentatives and the student body. Oth—
erwise, self-govemance will be no
more than an empty phrase. Self-
governance is a privilege that should
not be taken lightly.

There are choices we have to make,
There are lots of them. Our days are
spent in making decisions: what to
eat? what to wear? go to class, skip
class? shower? shave? say hi to this
person in passing? what word should
follow this word’.7 what will I do
now? -

Our lives are our decisions.

So often I find myself wondering
how I got into whatever situation I
am in. I wonder why I took the steps
I took, I wonder why I didn’t go in
all the limitless other directions. And
I try to remember whatI was think—
ing in those moments which now
seem so crucial. Sometimes I can,
sometimes I can't. There are so many
steps between the leaps.

When you walk quickly, you don’t
always know you are walking
quickly. When you are wasting your
life, you don‘t always know it.

One decsion I've made in life is to
work towards changing the world. I
want to live in a less material, more
spiritual, and more caring world.

Another decision I‘ve made is to
watch the Simpsons every day.

Another was to read a book instead
of playing with my cat.

I decided to see Titanic.

Once I compromised art for a
friend's feelings
..And once I didn‘t.

We make decsions. That is life.

Some decisions help us towards our
goal, others don‘t, A better world
begins with better decisions. Better
decisions come from grcaler aware-
ncss of the choices. Every moment
oflife must be examined, causethere
is no one moment, no one decision
which is unimponani.

When we choose to eat meat, we
must be aware of what we are eat-
ing, what sort ofindustry we are sup-
porting, what environmental conse-
quenccs our action will have.

And when dressing, we must won-
der ifthose Nikes we put on our feet
are comfortable enough tojustify the
slave wages paid to child laborers to
produce them. Is it right to support
and grant additional wealth to a comr
pany which produces not one shoe
in the United States, and not one shoe
with more than a few dollars produc-
tion cost; which sells shoes at prices
exceeding $100?

And how comfortable can leather
feel on the back?

When you walk by someone in the
loggia are you not saying hi cause
you don’t like them? Why are we
afraid of appearing kind to strang-
ers?

When youjudge someone and dis
miss their values can you be helping
anything?

And when we know our goals, how
can we justify not stepping towards
them?

I am not a barefoot Vegetarian. Per-
haps I someday will be, and perhaps
that will make me a better person,
but it just might not. The point is that
all goals are possible, we just aren’t
ready to make the decisions which
will lead us there. Sacriﬁces are re»
quired. The things we learn to want
in a commercial culture are most
likely not the things we need. We
must decide those things. Over and
over again, we must decide.

The seeds which will grow an en
lightened age can be planted any time

Spring Break is a goddamn joke.
It’s a tease, a farce, another conr
spiracy this school engages in to fur
ther perpetuate my torment and
angst. For two and a half weeks I'
studied and wrote and cried every~
day because of a series of papers and
exams that never seemed to end. I
didn’t sleep. And it was barely freez-
ing outside so I couldn‘t go running
either. I wrote a paper that got erased
on the computer as I was printing it
out. Ten minutes later I had to leave
for Califomia....

Sun. Rain. Mountains. The Ocean.
All you can eat Ethiopian buffet for
$4.95. I was happy there, almost re—
laxed. The twitch in my right eye
disappeared after the ﬁrst week. For
awhile it was all good. I could take
walks all day and climb to the top of
“hills” and go to a Polynesian lei
bar with an indoor lake that was
rained upon every half hour. The

Tonga Room, it’s quite an experir
ence. I got 10 see my friends that are
here no longer as well as my best
friend from home, all of whom
seemed much better off emotionally
than I. The vegetables were cheaper
and organic and tasted good! And I
learned that it is possible to feel cone
tent for awhile...

And then the bus pulled into cam-
pus and the twitch returned. And my
blood pressure rose and I felt a panic
attack coming on...

Ihad to write a paper. Ihad to write
another paper. And after that, yet
another one. All to catch up to Mon-
day. And I had to write an essay for
a grant so I can do my supercooljob
Igot in Washington DC this summer.
That had to be postmarked by Tues-
day. And take a quiz. And an exam.
I’ve discovered that the reason you
get two weeks of spring break is be-
cause you need it to catch up to all
the shit from before and then start
on more shit for the next week. I
don‘t feel relaxed anymore. There
is no tranquillity left over from San
Francisco. And I ﬁnd it particularly
interesting that my basic human
functions of breathing. sleeping, eat-
ing, and moving are disrupted and
sometimes very difﬁcult because of
the time I have to spend staring at
and typing into a glowing box.

1 think I'm going to start smoking
again. Maybe that will help me feel
less angry.

Note to Prospectives: Don’t come
here.

SGA Blood Drive April 15 and 16

The campus community is encouraged to participate in changing the lives of those in need by taking part in
the upcoming blood drive. By donating just one pint of blood, you can make a difference in the lives of up to
four sick or injured people. The Blood Center of Central Iowa and SGA are calling all eligible students,
faculty, and staff to donate blood on Wednesday and Thursday, April 15 and 16. The drive will be held in the
Hanis Center between the hours of 10am and 4pm both days. The entire procedure, including a mini-
physical and refreshments afterward, takes less than an hour. Since there is no substitute for blood, patients
depend on dedicated donors like you to give regularly. To be eligible, donors should be 17 years of age or
older, in good health, weigh at least 110 pounds and have eaten a good meal prior to donating. If you wish to
make an appointment, contact Jae Hines, Student Services Coordinator by email at [SERVICE].
