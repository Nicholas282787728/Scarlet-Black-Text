His maior was an easy one—biol-

“Ever since I was a kid that’s been
the stuff I’m interested in , . . what
makes life work, how it happens , , . it
seemed like the logical choice,” said
Dusty.

I ask him why he asks me every

“Cause. I never know any of the

Avolos questions classroom equaliiy

BY CATHY BEIL‘
Guest Writer

While common American ideol-
ogy may hold that education is the

great equalizer, many students and ,

faculty at Gtinnell do not view their
classrooms as bastions of equality. If.
theoretically, we are all supposed to
have equality ofoppottunity in class-
room discussions, why do some stu»
dents often dominate, while others
remain silent?

Perhaps more than personalityi
brains, and bravery determine who is
likely to contribute to class discus-
sions.

In a talk entitled “Cultural Capi-
tal in the Classroom, Who has it, Who
doesn't, and Why Race and Gender
Matter” given as part ofthe Hate free
Grinnell Brown Bag Lecture series.
Professor ofSociology Lisa Avalos dis-
cussed some issues pertaining to in-
equity in the classroom.

In this informal dialogue, Amlos
related her experiences with classroom
dynamics to a small group ofstudents,
faculty, and staff, and led discussion
on the topic,

Avaios observes that who talks and
is listened to in our classrooms seems
to be at least partly function ofstu-
dents’ “cultural capital," those sym-
bolic traits, values, signs, and skills
which people use to signify their sta-
tus in a variety ofsituations‘,

We use cultural capital to deter-
mine what is expected ofus in differ-
ent environments,

Pieces ofit include changeable fea-
tures like our style ofdress, language
usage, grammar, and dialect; and fixed
ones, like our race or gender, Every-
one has and uses cultural capital, but
its contents are as different as we are,
and its meanings and usefulness are
wholly contextual.

The same signiﬁer or knowledge

that might be positive or useful in
one situation, could be negative or
irrelevant in another.

Avalos contends that at Grinnell,
like many small liberal arts colleges,
the types ofculrural capitalwhichare
valued and rewarded tend ro repre»
sent male, white, middlerelass. and
liberal individuals and values. She
recalled Lani Guiners convocation
talk on dynamics in law school class
rooms as an example of the hegc.
mony ofthis competitive model, and
noted that We too have a “canary”
telling us that there is something
wrong with the atmosphere of our
classrooms which not only hurts it,
but the “miners" as well.

In her three years teaching here,
Avalos has found that women and
students of color are often (but not
always) uncomfortable and quiet
during class discussions, while the
majority ofrhore who speak up seem
to be white men.

This phenomena is not surpris.
ing. In fact, it has been well docu.
mented in educational research that
males are called on more, and speak
more in discussion from preschool
to graduate school.

However, why this happens, and
what it means for education, is hotly
debated. The students and others
who attended Avalos talk felt that the
issue ofwho talks in the classroom,
how they do, and why they feel they
can, is very important.

Her ideas about how cultural
capital operates amongstudciits,and
between professors and students,
privilcging some students while si-
lencing others, definitely resonated
with rhcm.

Through tliccouisc ofdiscussion,
itbccameclearrhaisnidcntspcrccive
the most common classroom discus
sion atmosphcrc, structure and for.
mat as one of fierce individualistic

competition, and not cooperation. Stu-
dents feel pushed ro aggressively “jump
in” if they want to be heard by their
classmates and professors, rather than
being invited to participate. Those who
are uncomfortable with this style usu.
ally are effectively silenced and assumed
to have nothing to add, rather than hav-
ing space opened for them and their
ideas.

professor Avalos hypothesizes that
while it has been easier for white men
to take up the dominant discourse and
style of intellectual
unproblemaricly, women and students
ofcolor may be more likely to have been
socialized to listen rather than talk in
the classroom setting, and to value types
ofrelatmg other than competition.

While recognizing that no one di-
rectly coerces students not to speak, this
is the effect that results from the inter.
action of hegemonic dominant dis»
course which rewards conformity and
students and professors internalized ate
titudes regarding the appropriateness of
different voices and ideas.

The group discussed the possible
causes and ramiﬁcations ofwhites and
males disproportionate voice in class-
rooms, and what students, professors.
staff, and the institution itselfcan do to
change it.

Avalos emphasized rhar there is no
direct blame to place on any group, such
as professors or white males, but that
we all need to criticallyexamine the way
pcople have internalized the different
types of roles open to students and
teachers

The dynamics ofa classroom discus
sion can reveal who feels powerful and

dialogue

who feels, or is, powerless.

While they definlrcly do not rcprc.
scnt all of the different types of ideas
and people in the world, we can learn a
great deal by looking at our classrooms
as microcosms ofsocicty.

The holiday season is typically
known to cause a great deal ofstress
when dealing with family, expenses,
not to mention, for most students,
being far from Grinnell. Obviously
stress can happen anytime, and ifstu»
dents find themselves dealing with
overwhelming feelings of loss, pres
sure, or any other srressor, it is advised
that they make an effort to seek out.

no support groups specifically afﬁli-

Well, the time ofyear is approach
ing again, when all ofa sudden, Grins
nell abandons its unwritten “conforms
ing to nonconformiry” rule and una
dergoes a transformation that renders
most people that you know unrecog.
nizable at first glance.

Yes, as you all are fully aware, the
event that spurs this radical makeover
is Winter Waltz, which will be held
at Harris Center on saturday, Decem-
ber s.

For the firsr.years, this will be a
fairly shocking experience, as they will
see not one sweatshirt or pair of pa.
jama bottoms the whole night. For the
seniors, the occasion might be a trifle
saddening, as it will mark one ofrhe
last times that they see their friends
looking like they just stepped out of
GQ or Vogue (ok, so that might be a
slight exaggeration, but its all rela.
tive.., throw me a friekl'n’ bone hctcl).

The absence of two.day.old
stubble and legs that haven't been
shaved in months, not to mention the
swirling dresses and immaculate suits.
actually makes one think that they are
at a different college altogether.

The evening is magical and almost
everyone looks as though they have
iust walked off the set of a Grace
Kelly/Fred Astaire movie (sans the
dancing ability, that is),

Waltz itself, however, is not usu-
ally me most entertaining part ofrhe
evening. The fun actually begins at rhe
prewalrz parties, and is then later
continued at the postrwallz party at
ter the interim, “let's actually attempt
to dance to the music the live band is
playing and who cares rhar not one
person in Harris actually knows how
to waltz.“

This year, there are two big pm»
waltz parties. The ﬁrst is being thrown
by Rawson, Dibble, and Clark and
will be held in Rawson lounge. samir
sashikant ‘00 is normally the primary
organizer ofthis gala event and does
an excellent job of making the party
asuecess.

Apart from the fact that the lounge
is always beautiful decorated for the
occasion,one ofrhe main attractions
of the Rawson preparry is the
“punch" traditionally made by cone
noisseurs stan Banks '99 and Josh
Rehmann ‘00.

The second pre.walrz party is the
highly publicized White House bash
at 1017 High Street.

“Pie-Waltz at the White House
has been a tradition for 153.3 of a
century," said shawn Hoy ‘99.

it was started by the original
White House 5, two ofwhich are still
around as graduation became a less
attractive alternative to hosting annual
prc—Waltz parties.

The tradition is that the parrygoers
are served various sundries by the in-

The postwaltz party is scheduled
to be held at Norris again and prom.

Still, even though rhcrc is always a
full moon on Waltz, Grinnell students
look forward to this night for weeks
and weeks before its eventuality, and
regardless ofwhat mayor catastrophes
occur during its course. a good time is
generally had by all.

As an interesting side note, Waltz
