After two consecutive road vic—

game against a tough Midwest Con—
ference foe. This Saturday, the Pro—

Rosenbloom Field at 1:30pm.

Last year Carroll boasted one of
the top running attacks in the con-
ference led by All—America tailback
Steve Harris, Although they lost
Harris to graduation, Carroll’s of—
fense remains formidable. “Theystill
have a very strong running game
which is complemented by their two
outstandingreceivers,"saidGrinnell
head coach Greg Wallace. “On de—
fense they pursue the ball well which
results in a lot of gang tackles and
turnovers,” he added.

Although Carroll poses a chal—
lenge for the Grinnell gridders, the
Pioneers stand an excellent chance

they had this weekend against Prin—

with the overall effort ofthe squad,"
commented coach Wallace, “Most
of the time the offense, the defense
and kicking game executed extreme—
1y Well."

Grinnell’s defense led the charge
by forcing seven turnovers. Junior
Sean Cotten topped the list of indi-
vidual performances by recording 10
tackles and snagging two intercep—
tions. Junior Kevin Humiston and
sophomore Jason Zeeh also picked off
one pass apiece. Co—captains Dan
Packard and Paul Nelson forced one
fumble each. Cornerback Evan Petig
effectively covered Principia's top re—
ceiver all afternoon while accumulat—
ing five tackles and breaking up three
passes.

Grinnell’s offense and kicking
game also compiled some good statis—
tics. Early in the third quarter fresh—
mun RichardWemerspnnted 81 yards
for a touchdown on a punt return.
offensively the Pioneers racked up
216 yards rushing, including four
touchdowns on the ground. Senior
Ian Shoemaker ran for two touch—
downs. Also, freshman Wade Krause
and junior Eric Riensche each rushed
for a touchdown while gaining 82
yards and 98 yards respectively. Fi—
nally, freshman quarterback John
Hunt led the passing game by going 7

right end lake Boyer, a sophomore,

Against Carroll, Orinnell will
need another strong game from the
defense to hold the opponent in check.
At the same time the Offense hopes to
grind out the running game as it did
against Principia, “Wehnverosrepit
up a level ifwe want to beat Carroll,”
concluded Coach Wallace.
