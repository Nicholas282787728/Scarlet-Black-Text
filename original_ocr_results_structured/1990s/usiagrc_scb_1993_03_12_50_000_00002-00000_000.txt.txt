Moffett Published in Theatre J ourrta

HEATRE Professor Sandy

I Moffett, who gave yester-

day‘s convocation lecture

about American playwright Eugene

O‘Neill, will havean article published
this spring in a scholarly journal.

Moffctt‘s account of his experi-
ence directing last fall’s production
of George Peele’s The Old Wife’s
Ta!e,“Process andStructureSharcd,"
will be published in the spring issue
of the quartlerly New England The-
atre Journal.

The Old Wife's Tale was written
by Pcele around the same time his
countrymanWilliam Shakespeare was
writing some of his best-known plays.

Moit'ett teaches his students the
difference between a critic and a di»
rector by using an archeological meta-
phor: Critics dig below the surface to

find hidden treasures of meaning.
Directors Start in a hole and climb to
the surface, presenting polished arti-
facts to the audience. Planning to
direct a strange play by a less-titan-
well-known playwright, Moffett in
deed found himself in a deep hole.

As Mol'fett thought about this
difficultplay, he noticeditresemblod
aformofentcrtainmentthatwaspopu-
lar in Italy around the same time
Peele was writing in England;
cammedia dell'urte.

Cammedm dell ’ar/e troupes were
acting companies that traveled
throughout Europe in the 16th cenv
tury amusing audiences with their
improvised comedy routines. The
troupes elaborated on basic written
scenarios using stereotyped charac-
ters. Some of those characters,

clowns, for instance, are still around
in popular culture today. Others, like
blowhard warrior-heroes and opinr
ionated know-it—alls, have been up
dated. The cowardly lion from The
Wizard ofOz is an example.
Moffeu did not ﬁnd proof that
Peele was inﬂuenced directly by the
cammedia dell ’arre. Instead, he says.
itwas like noticing similarities today
between a comedy on stagc and
television‘s Saturday Night Live.
Observers can’t be sure one influ»
enced the other, but they cart see that
both have been inspired by the same
sources and both use the same mcthr
ods to make their audiences laugh.
Mofl'ett and his student-actors
used their study of commcdt'a tech—
niques as a ladder to climb out of the
hole of bringing The 01:! Wife': Tale

to the stage. They added some impro-
vised routines into thegaps in Peele’

text to create a novel production to

Grinnell audiences that might hav

worked as well in 16th century En

gland or Italy.

Correction

Page one of last week’s Scarlet
and Black erroneously reported
thatChadFinkehaddefeatedScott
Ihriginthe SGA presidential clecr
tion by only 8 votes, 388 to 380. In
actuality, Chad Finke won by 80
votes, 388 to 308. Monica Horton
beat Jeremy Lipshutz 444 to 224
in the vice presidential election.
The 3&8 apologizes for its error.
