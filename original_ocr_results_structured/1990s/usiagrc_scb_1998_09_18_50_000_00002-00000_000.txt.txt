BY EMILY LARSON

Brad Pitt fans beware: Andy Nelson, who
runsTuasday Movie Madness alongwirh Jamal
Rogers and Helen Brown, is willing to guar-
anrae rhas this movie star, along Meg Ryan
and Tom Cruise, will never grace the Gardner
screen on a Tuesday night this year, “You will
never see Cameron Diaz there," said Nelson,
"basically every ‘cute' Hollywood persona.”

Tuesday Movie Madness has a his.
tory ofproviding the Crinncll community with
a variety of movies, including independent
movies and classics. it was started two years
ago, and was run by Gregg Lind ‘98 andAndy
Nelson last year. This year, she Madness Con»
tinues, run by Nelson , Rogers, and Brawn.

“The goal oiTuesday Movie Mad-
ness is to offer an alternative to the ﬁlms com-

mittee," says Brown. “We show ﬁlms that are
rare or older ﬁlms you never see anymore."
Andy Nelson agrees, claiming the aim ofMovie
Madness is to “show obscure ﬁlms, indie or
foreign, show good classics - movies that we
feel are neglected in the greater scheme of
things.” According to Nelson, Movie Mad.
ness is fueled by the desire of movies by me
Crinnell community: “the kids at Crinnell
dig it, you know the unconventional movies,”
says Nelson. “Well, we just love movies here -
all kinds, Where else can you see seven mov»

The organizers ofMovie Madness are
not short on movie expertise. Helen Brown

tee and considers comedies to be her favorite.

“I love comedies and i would like to incarpo»
rate more comedies inro Movie Madness," said
Brown, “ and perhaps a few good ones from
the top loo lisr that most people haven't seen."
Andy Nelson is a member of the
eulsural ﬁlms committee and teaches an ExCo
class, “American independent Film, post
1984." “last semester there were four ﬁlm
classes taught in she Exco,“ says Nelson, “this
term only two. but the enthusiasm persists."

BY JEREMY TOLEERT

The nice lady at Films got me the

shat are showing this week i am reviewing, in
no particular order are: Deep Impact,
Barﬁanlla, and Cinema Pavads'tio.

I won't bore you too long with my
analysis ofDeep Imp“): I’m sure most ofyou
rushed out eagerly so see the disaster ﬁlms for
the late 903 this past summer. However, if
you live chained in a cellar, with rats as your
only source ofoutside information, you may
not know about this movie, It's about a big
rock that's going so his the earth, and ever)“
one is going to die, except for presidents, dic-
tators, and little kids who discover the rock
that will kill everyone. Oh, and cockroaches.
ifdiey can survive nuclear blasts, I’m sure they
can survive big rocks. At ﬁrst, they think me
big rock is going to hit Canada. This drought
alone makes me smile. All those smug, free
health-care receiving bastards looking up in
terror rhose last few seconds before they are
reduced to elements on the periodic charr,..
ahh, I would have paid much more to see it.
However, the PR boys discovered that the
name Canaan Impact didn’t have quite the ring
to it, so‘ they decided that the part of the as-
teroid that hits (as part ofir always does) will
hit the ocean, making it a general pain in the
ass for the special effects guys. The other an.
noying thing about this movie is shat it seems
to be paid by CNBC to be the news channel
that breaks to the world die fact that everyone
is going to die. I hasc producs plugs in mov»
ics, even ifir is for a crappy news channel that
will never in the existence 0F mankind com—

ing name of the week. I'm sure the parodies
on this one will be rentable for years.

The second godawful movie of the
week is Baa/tavern. Urn, what the hell was
the Films committee smoking when they dc.
cided to show this? This movie was alone rc-
sponsiblc for setting the Woman’s Liberation
Movement back so years. Angry mobs or‘radi.
cal lesbian'feminists held mass burnings ofthe
copies of this half—asscd attempt at a science
ﬁction movie!

Basically, Barbarella stars Jane
Fonda—before she became politically correct-

as some sort ofspaca vixen who ﬁoars around
in her weird-ass space ship and does stripteases
for the opening credits ofreally bad movies.
The president, who speaks with the most aw-
ful French accent I’ve ever heard calls her up
on she computer while she’s sitting there nude,
and salutes her with the Vulcan hand thing,
while saying in a monotonous voice "Love.”
Did I mention the wall-towall orange shag
carpet in the cockpit of her spaceship? Can
you guess what time period this movie is from?
The sixties were not known for their grasp of
science, and the primary special effect in this
movie is she use ofa lava lamp, Coincidence?
I think not. '

So, she plot. He be. As ifthis movie
would ever be considered to have a plot. Well,
the idea is that one of Earth’s scientists Duran

“pretty pretty.“ That’s pratsy hrnny too, and
when she came on screen, I watched that as
well. in general, I drink that an angryraid
should be made on Videoland for having a
copy ofrhis, and then more angry raids should
be made to destroy whatever copies Harris has
when they show it. This movie should be
purged trons our history, and forgotten. it was
conceived ofin a backwards rima when sex was
always implied and you never really gor to see
any skin. This was a horrible idea tossed aside,
luckily. We’re ﬁnally starting to recover from
the setbacks in female rights. lets not suffer
any more by showing ﬁlms like this. People
rnighr start garring ideas! I give this movie half

Cinema is Paradise;
Deep Impact Makes
Little Impact

BY ZORKA MILIN

Cinema Paradira [ml], [958, apprai-
marzly 2 hours.

A nostalgic homage to the medium itself,
Cinema Paradisa illustrates how the power of
the screen can have a lasting inﬂuence on our
lives. it won an Oscar, did great at Cannes,
and it deserves all the acclaim it has received.
Set in a quaint Sicilian village as the and of
WWII, the ﬁlm centers on a fadiarless boy
Salvatore, who spends most of his waking
hours in small theater that bears the ﬁlm’s title.

cal persecution of the Gypsies and to evi.

KDIC Goes
Down

BY COURTNEY SHERWOOD
Editor-in-Chief

KDIC’s ﬁrst full broadcast day was marred
by an equipment failure on Thursday.

When a power amplifier stopped work-
ing, the station’s normal broadcast capacity
of 130 wasrs was virtually eliminated.

“The only place you could hear the radio
station was from the [KDIC] office," said
Music Director Matt Ryan ‘00.

As a result, “broadcasts were canceled from
noon until 3:45 pm," station Manager Brad
Hilkene ‘99 said.

“An engineer has taken the broken power
amp and will be . . . working on getting that
fixed," said Hilkane,

In the mean time, the broadcast range has
been temporarily increased to ten watts, mak-
ing KDIC audible on campus, although not
far beyond its boundaries. Repairs should rc—

 

turn die station to normal operating param-
eters by early next week.

people’s heads. Also, parsieularly memorable
are moments with the local priest previewing
the movies before may are released. From the
power ofhis ofﬁce, he demands that all scenes
ofcarnal excess (is. kissing) be edited out, so
the audience gets to sea counsless Hollywood
melodrarnas where men and Women look at
each osher in suspense, come closer, seem about
to kiss, and then (with the jerk ofa jumpcut)
are. standing apart, exchanging a meaningful
look.

The story is told in ﬁashback, after
the aduls Salvatore (now a director working in
Rome), hears anlfredo’s deathThe early parts
are the most magical, shingsscam so grow more
predictable. still, the ending is perfectly un-
forgettable. And despite the fact that the ver.
sion which I saw was dubbed, (I hope that’s
nor what they're showing), I highly recom-
mend this ﬁlm so anyone who enjoys movies.

Yet another pseudo-Spielbergian
summer blockbuster; actually, I think it was
even produced by zneMassevhimself. in a nut-
shell: Deep Impact is similar to, but not as good
as Independence Day (even despite the medl»
ocrisy of the latter). it appeared to me as if
some shots were taken directly from Indepen»
aenctDay.

Generally. I prefer ﬁbns that defy easy
genre classiﬁcation, still, there are some genres
ofwhich I count myselfa loyal fan, and doomst
day movies juss aren’t one of them. We've al-
ready seen lorsa ﬂoods and twisrcrs and quakes
and volcanoes and aliens and comets and
plagues and towering infernos. So, Idon’t know
about you, but I just don't feel like sitting
shrough a long and tedious build-up so a hot-
rifying yer predictable catastrophe thars treated
as a carnival thrilleride, done MTVrvidco ssylc.
What’s worse, dais one tries to disguise itselfas
a human drama. Well, it isn't, it's an uninspired
exhibit of tacky Amaricanism, the messianic
we'rc-going—to-savettheercst-of:the-world type,
only in this case with a little help from d1:

say; oceans rise and cities fall — but hope for
