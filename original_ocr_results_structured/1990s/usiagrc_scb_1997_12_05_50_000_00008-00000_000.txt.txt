sw1m an invitational meet like the for
mat we’ll use in the Midwest Confer

Coach Erin Hurley.

Hurley.

Diver Jo Schaalman led the squad
as she and Liz Welch combined to cap-
ture ﬁrsi place in one and ll’ll'eerl‘nclcl’
diving. Schaalman scored 256.55
polniS, which set a new school record

Thal mark is also good enough to send
her to the NCAA Division III national
meet, Schaalman must surpass the
qualifying standard one more timc this
season for an invitation to the national
meet.

“These two divers got us off to a
great start. They are going to have very
good seasons for us," offered Hurley.

a 2:2856. Hurley noted that all three
times were good 100 ﬂy marks.

Two swimmers. Kirsten Anderson
and Angela Crowleeroch, caught
their coach’s eye in non»scoring
events. “I think these two swimmers
have improved enough that they could
score for us in an invitational," said
Hurley.

Hurley completed her comments
on the women: "I'his was a good meet
for us and a nice win. If we can keep
the edge on Luther I think we‘ll be far
vored to win our invitationzy and the
Iowa College meet.”

On the men's side, Luther posted
an 18-point
edge over
Grinnell to
claim the
m e n ’ s
G l e y s te e n
crown. The

tile swimmer because he is the fastest
in the butterﬂy and the second fastest
in the freestyle. She also highlighted
the continued progress of Nathan
Lcauck 1n the sprint free events.

Severn won praise for his work in
the ﬂy and Hurley noted a strong 500
free performance in the distance re»
lay. “Compared to last year, Aaron
clocked a faster 500 free time by six
seconds in Saturday's meet," offered
ihe coach

The 300 breaststroke unit had the
only other secondrplace ﬁnish. Zeb
Cunin. Greg Pelcrson and ion Edel
clocked a 2:51.23 for second. “Their
finish was a nice surprise," note
Hurley.

“This was another good meet for
us. It should boost our conﬁdence.
This team has a lot of work ahead of
11, but we have a group of swimmers
who are capable ofdoing the work and
getting better," concluded the coach.
