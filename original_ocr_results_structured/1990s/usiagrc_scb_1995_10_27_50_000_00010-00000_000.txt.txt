Last weekend the OrinnellCol—

ed by Lawrence in Madison, Wis»
consin. The tournament ended a
successful campaign, according to
Coach David Arseneault, “It was the
first time that I had a team play its
best tennis at the conference tourna—
ment.” stated Atseneault. Overall.
the Pioneers finished ninth out of
eleven teams. However, the netters
were only nine points away from fin-
ishing seventh,

Coe and Cornell battled for
first place, with Cornell even-
tually succumbing to Coe, Saint
Norbert finished third and
Knox placed fourth. Ripon,
Beloit, Lawrence. and Lake
Forest rounded out the top eight.
Carroll and lllinois College
ended their seasons with tenth
and eleventh place finishes,
respectively.

Coach Arseneault stated
that the highlights for Gun—
nel] during the tournament did
not come from the team‘s wms,
but rather from their close
losses. Jeanne Mackenzie bat—

tied Carroll’s No, 2 singles player to
the end, but was eventually downed.
Sachi Naruo, after beating Carroll‘s
No. 5 player, found herself playing
the No. 4 seeded Ripon Opponent.
Naruo was able to keep the matched
tied after two sets before succumbing
to her foe. Arseneault commented
that althoughthe team lostatseveral
positions,the scoreswere closerthan
those of the regular season.

The team‘s other highlights in—
cluded wins from Cindy Robbins at
No. 6 singles, Ryanjun at the No. 3
spot, and Rebecca Schucller, Orin—
nell's No. 6 singles player, Coach
Arseneault was overjoyed with the
effort and stated. "We played the
best tennisofourentireseasonat the
tournament." He furtherstated, “The
team accomplished, rather exceed.
ed, the goals set for them at the
beginning of the tournament, and
more importantly. for the season."

“Adding a new coach can lead
to player distress, therefore one of
the team's season goals was to come
together as a group. i thought the
team did a wonderful job of bonding
over the season,” finalized Arsene<
aiilt. Next year Atseneault hopes to
bringintwo orthree good recruits. A
few recruits mixed in With the sea«
soned veterans should provide the
Pioneers with a more competitive
team.

Challenges and opportunity

ERIC RIENSCHE
SPORTS INFORMATION WRITER

As the Grinnell College men's
soccer team (11—4—1. 9—1) enters the
final stretch of the season, it is con«
fronted with both a tough challenge
and a wonderful opportunity. The
main challenge for the Pioneers is to
overcome the nagging injuries that
plagied them during their fall break
tripi On the other hand, Grinnell
Will have the chance to Capture its
third consecutive Midwest Confer—
ence title this weekend at Lake For—
est. Grinnell has already clinched
first place in the final standings of
the MWC South Division,

The Pioneers’ hopes for a third
MWC title rest on the health of the
team after a troubling three<game
road trip. In a 3»O Victory Over lllir
nOis College, starters Neil Good<
speed, Warren Morrow and Darren
Bass suffered minor injuries, and had
to sit out the next two games This
lack of personnel may have contrib-
uted to the subsequent ZeZ tie versus
ROse—Hulman and the 4—0 loss to
DePauw, Against Rose-Hulman iun—
iorsChadStewartand Ryan Mcoary
punched in one goal each to give
Grinnell :1 Zrl lead. But Rose—Hul—
man scored a late goal for a 2.2 tie.
Neither team gave up a goal in two
overtime periods so the game ended
in a ZrZ deadlock.

In the DePauw game Grinnell
was frustrated by an extremely ag—
gressive, physical style of play, “We
lost our composure a few times," said
Coach John Pfitsch. “We got a cour
ple of yellow cards and in general just
had a bad day." Despite the disap—
pointing loss, Coach Pfitsch lauded
the efforts of Seth Kleiman, Ryan
Fenberg, Dustin Goot and Will Ash-
ley.

Although the Pioneers got
mixedtesultsftom thefallbreak trip,
theystillshowplentyofpositivesigns
as they head into the postsseasoni
Coach Pfitsch is optimistic that his
team will be at full strength With
the team’s 31 OT victory against
Coe they continue to ride a long
winning streak against conference
opponents. The Pioneers have lost
only one league match this season,
and the loss was to Monmouth. which
failed to qualify for the playoff.

Gtinnell's first tournament
match is this Saturday against Beloit
(8»2),theMWCNorthDivisionsec—
ond-place team. “My impression is
that Beloit is a very good team,"
commented Coach Pfitsch. “They
are coming offzi big overtime victory
against Saint Norbert which pro—
pelled them into the playoffs.” Ifthe
Pioneers win Saturday, they will ad.
vance to the championship match
Sunday against the winner of the
CoerLake Forest semi-final. To win
these two games and retain the title
of MWC champions, the Pioneers
