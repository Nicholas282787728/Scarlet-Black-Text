People have been vigorously rrain-
ing for monrhs for rhis. Berring pools
spread across offices for bragging riglirs
narion-wide, as morning coffee breaks
are lakcn r0 lllc runs of ESPN and
more riine is spenr on inrerner check-
ups of rhe favorires and underdogs
rhan rhe spreadshecr for romorrow's
presenrarion.

lr is rhe beginning ofMarch Mad-
ness-die NCAA basketball tourney,
and, nor coincidenrally, Sl baskerball
season, our own beloved intramural
league, Aerial dreams will be made
and sharrered afrer llle high rops are
laced up, she harnsrrings srrerched. and
pre-game layups shor.

The differences berwecn the two

leagues obviously are subsranrial.
Unforrunarely, ever Will an NCAA

ence of a player wearing black-

The unchecked joy of a blocked

Even by Grinnell College srudcnrs
who have ﬁelded a record 22 reams

Being ofrhe same beasr, $1 and rhc

There is a regular season ro deronnine
