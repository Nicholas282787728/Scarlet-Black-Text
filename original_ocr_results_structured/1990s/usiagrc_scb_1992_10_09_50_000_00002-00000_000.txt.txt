House candidate Larry Chroman with his campaign has.

NL candidates present program
— TM and unified field theory

Natural Law Party candidates
Stuart Zimmerman (US. Senate,
Iowa) and Larry Chroman (U.S.
House, 3rd District, Iowa) spoke about
their new political party and its solu-
tions for America's problems
Wednesday evening inNorth Lounge.

Arriving in a brightly painted
campaign bus, Zimmerman and
Chroman answered questions about
transcendental meditation, education
and prison reform, health care and
uniﬁed ﬁeld theory. The candidates
arebrothersdnrlaw,businessmenand
philanthropists who have jumpedinto
politics in response to the nation’s
intractable problems and Washing-
ton panisarl gridlock. Their party
seeks to “bring the light of science
into politics." They emphasize not
beliefs or opinions on problems, but
rather scientiﬁcally veriﬁed solutions
to problems.

Thenewparty,foundedApri120
in Fairfield, Iowa has “new ideas and
new solutions for America’s old prob-

lems,” said Zimmerman. These new
ideas include establishing an energy
policy to end the nation ’5 dependence
on foreign oil, slashing health care
costsbyemphasizingprevention,and
running the special interests out of
politics.

The candidates drew the most
questions on their ideas about the
applicability of transcendental medi»
ration to reduce criminal recidivism
and even to foster world piece.
Chromansummatizedtheliinsteinim
concept of the “uniﬁed ﬁeld,” allud-
ing to the nature of a laser beam and
the “square root of one" principle of
coherence in energy and matter.

The Candidates cited numerous
scientific studies and projects that
they Lhemselveslnltiate/d whichprove
the value of TM in improving prison
environments. The most striking ex7
ample of their success is in the West
African country of Senegal where
convict recidivism plunged from 90
percent to only seven percent after

the president of that country imple-
mented the kind of meditation pro-
gram endorsed by the Natural Law
Party. In a country once plagued by
terrible prison riots and repeat of-
fenses, the president eventually is-
sued a general amnesty. Their ape
proach has also been tried with we
cess in a number of American pris»
ons, they said.

As for national defense and world
peace, they claim that if the “coher-
enceof the Collective consciousness"
of this nation is established, lhccoun-
try will be immune to attack and
unlikely to engage others in warfare.
A core of 7000 military personell
trained in TM, they said, could bring
this kind of coherence to the nation
just as a comparably small portion of
the light spectrum brings coherence
to light in the form of a laser beam.
Internal insecurity, they claim, is the
culprit behind national violence and
warfare,

age.
Tuesday evening members of
PAFA held a study break about date
rape. Wednesday was a day of si-
lence to commemorate the silence in
which manysurvivors of sexual abuse
live. The day of silence was also
intended to bring attention to the si-
lencing of the issue in our society. At
7:30 Wednesday a candle light vigil
was held to end the silence.

Wednesday evening students
made an survivors quilt in Loose
Lounge, The Quilt is made out of a
variety of colored patches: purple
patches to represent survivors of do-
mestic violence, to represent sun/k
vors of sexual abuse and assault, and
blue patches to represent allies of
survivors. Of course many of the
patches include several colors.

Quilts are often made by groups
who drawn together overa traumatic
event. One can recall the AIDS Me»
morial quilt which toured the nation
a couple of years ago. Quilts
symbolise the drawing together of
varied experiences.

The survivors quilt shows how
violenceagainstwomen affects usall
because we are all connected Quilts
have long been a nieans for women to
show silent protest. The quilt will be
ondisplay atsomeinlhefuture,when
it is fully completed. Eventually it
will be hung in an Advocacy “safe
space room".

Thursday evening students put
out lumminaries, made from plastic
milk Jugs, around campus. The
lumminarics symbolised several
things. Some of the candles were put
in places were students feel that bet-
ter lighting is needed, The candles .
also represent, as candles often do,
hope for the survivors of sexual and
assualt and abuse.

The other event for Domestic
Violence Awareness Month which
the women‘s groups on campus are
planning is the annual Women Take
Back The Night. It will be held on
Thursday, October29 at7: 30 in North
Lounge. One of the final planning
meetings for Women Take Back The
Night will be this Tuesday at noon in
the Forum Coffeehouse.

Campbell's new
book Wins award

Envrronmental studies professor
Davtd Campbell has won 'the'
Houghton Mifflin Literary Fellow-
ship for his book The Crystal Desert.
The award is usually reserved for
works of fiction.

The book describes a summer
Campbell spentat the remote Brazil»
ian Antartctic research station,where
he studied plant and animal life on
the Antarctic peninsula, and where
he went scuba diving in unexplored
waters.

“Sometimes,” Campbell writes,
"in the sere glaciated interior of the
continent, Antarctica seems to bc a

prebiolic place, as the world must
have been before the broth of life
bubbled and popped into whales and
tropical forest—and humans. 1 was
lonely as an astronaut walking the
moon. But at other times, during the
short, erotic summeralon g the ocean
margins of the continent, Antarctica
seemed to be a celebration of every-
thing living..."

The book ts set for release Nov.
30, and thecolege will host a reading
by Campbell and the first book sign-
ing Dec. 2. Campbell is scheduled to
promote the book with a nationwide
tour this winter.

Burkle Center sponsors cor safety workshop

by Riva Sharples

Most of the vehicle break-
downs on the roads today could be
prevented. according to Doug Meeker,
Service Manager of West Finch
Chevrolet of Grinnell. Meeker and
two of his mechanics spoke about
basic hands-on mechanics and pro»
ventative maintenance to a small
crowd of Grinnell students and com
munity members October 1.

" The program was one in a series
on safety in society sponsored by the
Jeanne Burkle Women’s Center in
wake of the Zywicki murderffhere
are twenty-six points on a vehicle
whichshouldbeinspectedregularily,
said Meeker. Nineteenof these canbc
done by a vehicle‘s owner.ln newer

cars, manufacturers are making‘il
easier for the vehicle owner to get
involved by labeling things clearer,"
said Meeker.

“Manufacturers are very interr
cstcd in seeing the average person get
involved in Car care." Both front and
rear tires should be checked fre-
quently. Worn treads, marrs. and
cracked, dry \vhitewall can all be poi
tcntially dangerous to a traveler.
“Tirescome with a weargroove in the
middle of the tire,” said Meeker. “If
you take a pen or your finger and run
ltdown the middle ofthc tire, you can
feel this. If this groove starts to be
hardtofind,oriswomdown,it’s time
to change the tire.“ Meeker suggests
tire rotation at 6,000—21,000*36,000~
51,000 miles. Rotation is important
because front tires wear out more

quickly thzm back ones because they
are always turning.

The condition of the McPherson
Struts and rear shock absorbers can
be tcsted,by gently bouncing the car
afcwatimes. Ifthecarcomesupand
stops after being bounced, the shocks
are in good condition. If the car
continues to bounce up and down
bcforccoming toarest,howevcr, the
shocks are probably bad and need to
be replaced as soon as possible.

Engine and transmissron fluids
should always be a red color. Car
owners should periodically look un-
der the car for obvious leaks. The
level of fluid should also be
monitered. Motor oil should be
checked frequently and changed ev-
cry 2 to 3,000 miles.

One of the most important in

spections a driver can make is of the
condition of the hoses. Bad radiator
and heater hoses can spring a leak,
lose all fluid, and not only disable a
vehicle. but also cause hundreds of
dollars worth at damage to the
cnginc.”A twordollar hose could go
bad and cause $800 ln damtlgc,”said
Meeker, “This is a simple thing to
prevent by inspecting the hoses of-
ten. Don't Just check the big hoses,
but look for the smaller ones too,
because they are the most frequent
cause of problems. Look for l‘icxibilr
ity in the hose. Cracked or dry hoses
signal age and should be changed
immediately.

“Many people don’t check the
condition ofwiperbladcsuntilitmins.
However, blades, along with hcad-
lights and tum signals, should be

checked before the start of each trip.

Most breakdowns can be pre-
vented,Moekcrsaid. Ahigh percent
age of breakdowns requiring tow-
trucks are for small thingsltke two-
dollar hoscs, he said.

The Jeanne Burkle Women’s
Center will present other safety and
information programs throughout
Octobcrand Novembcr. “Parenting:
How to Talk to Children About Vior
lence and Life’s Dangers“ is the sub-
joctoftheOctober 15 lecture. “What
