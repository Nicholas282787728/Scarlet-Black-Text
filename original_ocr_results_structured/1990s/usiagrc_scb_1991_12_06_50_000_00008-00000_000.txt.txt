served as both an actress and an
assistant director.

a theater major. He will soon spend a
semester at the National Theatre In-
stitute at the Eugene O‘Neil Theatre,

According to course instructor

Toscanini, and “The King," examine

that nurtured their success and the
ways in which their images were

An exhibitofphotographs by wit
liam Case and Jack Robertson is on
display until Friday, Jan. 31, irl the
Hurling Gallery.

Case works with medium format
negatives, producing black and white
photographs. The photographs in this
exhibit were taken within the last
three years during Case's travels
throughoutEurope and theUrS. Many
show landscapes, while others focus
on some detail of ascenc. Case points
out that in producing such Work, one
must concentrate on those images
which will successfully makethe tran—
sition from reality to the abstraction
of various shades of grey,

Case, an associate professor of
physics here, has been teaching phoa
tography through independent study
projects at Gnnnell for several years.

Robertson, a freelance photogra»
pher also works with medium format
negatives, producing his own color

preciate the subtle character of the
Iowa landscape.

Robenson, a free-lance photograa
pher, has taught a basic photography
course for the Iowa Valley Continu-
ing Education Program.

The artists have dedicated this ex-
hibition “to the memory of Dwight
Nicholson, Robert Smith. and

Knight says that Pruley was an
artist “virtually created by the me
die,” a singerwho achieved phenom-
enal success not only because of his
artistic ability. but also because he fit
the record industry’simage of whats
rhythm and blues singer should be
like.

In the early ‘505. Knight explains,
R&B was an “underground" mustc,
something that was “banned in Bosr
ton." with little radio air play, at least
partly because mostR&B performers
were black. “Everyone in the music
industry knew that a white face, a
white voice doing the same music
would be a tremendous success,"
Knightsays.“WhenElviscamealong.
they grabbed him.“

Knightdoesn’tbclievethatPresley
completely lacked abilityNEIvis was
obviously a very talented guy,” he
says. “He must have had something
that enabled him to be Johnnyron»
theaSpot in that situation"

But the King‘s remarkable suc-
cess, Knight says. was due more to
the ”magnifying“ gaze of the media
than to any superior artistic ability.

The media also were integral in
shaping the images and ensuring the
longevity, of Beethoven and
Toscanini. Knightsays. “While early
portraits of Beethoven were quite
plain,” he says, “later drawings be-
came more dramatic arid romanti-
cized, showing Beethoven with an

eagle-like face, dark, brooding eyﬁ,
hair flying in the wind, with storm
cloudsinIhebackground."Thesedmr
matic portraits provided a strong vi-
snal reinforcement for Beethoven’s
tempestuous, stormy music.

Toscanini, too, was helped by the
media‘s exaggeration of his public
persona. An Italian anti-fascist in the
1930s,Toscaninihadspokcnoulpub-
liclyagainstMussolini.“HisU.S.pro-
motors made sure that this fact was
prominent in all publicity about the
conductor,"Knightsays.“Manyothcr
very talented conductors at the time
were German, and they were per-
ceivedascollaborators with theThird
Reich."

The public perceived Toscaninl as
a hero,and he was able to negotiate a
longrterm, exclusive deal with NBC
Television, which further enhanced
hispublicpcrsonawilh weekly broad-
casts of his work. Thus, Toscanini
had tremendousinfluenceon thepub-
lic understanding of classical music,
while other, equally talented conduca
tors received less attention.

Knight is careful not to downplay
the real abilities of the three musi-
cians who are studied in his class.
“Beethoven was a great composer,
Toscanani wasa great conductor, and
Elvis wasa great performer," he says,
"but we need to recognize that these
individuals’ tremendous success was
based in part on something other than
their musical abilities. Somebody
else could have done whatElvis did.
Somebody else could have done what
Toscanini did. I don'tthink that any
body else could've done what
Beethoven dldg but even he owes
part of his success to the external
factors that helped other artists like
Toscanini and Elvis Presley."
