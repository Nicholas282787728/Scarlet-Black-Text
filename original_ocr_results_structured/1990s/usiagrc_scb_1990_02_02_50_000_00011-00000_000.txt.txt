Pioneer Men Go
Down with Grace

By Steve Clem

The Grinnell Men‘s Swim
Team invaded Cedar Rapids last
weekend for tile extremely
competitive Five Season’s
invitational at Coe.

The teams present at the meet
included Dlvision I Creighton,
and two powerhouses ‘from
Wisconsin, U of W Stevens
Point, and U of W Milwaukee.
The competition at this year’s
Invitational was outstanding.

Dcspite a fourth-place flnish,
Coach Ray Obermlller was very
happy with the team‘s
performance. ”We had a good
performance. The times that
placed 1st in last year’s meet
would only have placed 6th or
7th at this meet."

With the increase in top
performance swimming, the
Pioneer‘s only winner was diver
Phil Bishop, Bishop claimed the
top position in both the I’Meter
and 3-Moter diving. According to
Coach Obermiiler, “Phil is
diving better than ever, and that
is saying a lot, considering how
he has done in the pasL"
