Senior Pascale Fisher’s “Emo—
tions oiRape andRccovcryl'has been
on display in the Terrace Art Gallery
for the last two weeks. The show is
the culmination of an independent
study in studio art, in which acrylic,
charcoal, and ceramic mediums are
used to "express the process of Vio—
lence, progressing through many sorts
of emotions, and then on to recov—
ery."

“Through the years, I‘ve come
back to the process of expressing
emotions in my art," she says. Fisher
is an art maior, also concentrating in
Gender and Women’s Studies. The
show combines her experience and
passion in both fields.

Since the age of sixteen, Fisher
has been involved with many sup—
port organizations and has worked

“My art for me is a way to work
through whatl deal vvith in my social
work," she says. The problems and
topics which she confronts are very
emotionally draining, she explains,
and the externalizationoi' thoseemo—
tions into art helps her to release the
stress. “Emotions of Rape and Re—

ofwork with survivors of rape

Some emotions which Fisher
explores in the show are loss or cmp»
tiness and depression which occur in
survivors after the act ofviolence, In
several pieces, the dark and blended
colors transmit the sadness and de-
pression of the characters. The pose
otothcr ﬁgures suggest the constant
stniggle tooyercome pain. onerecur.
ring theme in the show is that of
“chopped off” character's feet. This
theme expresses the “crippling effect
of rape and how a survivor is con.
stantly reminded of what has hap—
pened to him or her.”

The show also explores the dif«
ﬁcult process of recovery for survi—
vors, In the show's ﬁnal piece, “Re
birthofAnger,"Fishercelebratesthe
stage of recovery when a survivor
regains control of his/her emotions,
specifically anger, and directs these
emotions outward.

Several oithe charcoal and pa—
per images show the start descrip.
tion and sharp lines. This is reminis.
cent of the work of Kathe Kollwitz,
whom Fisher identifies as a major
inﬂuence in her art because of Kol|«
witz's successful depiction of“womv
en in emotional pain." Fisher feels
that for her the most difficult and
compelling feature oiart is the ques—
tion ofhow to express emotions on
canvas or paper. She hopes that
viewers can interpret those feelings
and empathize With the characters in
her artso they may understandsome«

and excited the audience. Bringing
the Kronos Quartet to Grinnell was

and internationally known among
music circles. Tickets fortheerl’iuIs»
clay performance in Iowa city were
expected to cost as much as fifty
dollars per person Sources estimate
that the honorarium paid to the Km»

twenty thousand dollars. There was
also an extra few thousand dollars

money spent was well worth it in
light ofthe Kronos Quartet's perfor
mance

Ktonos began their program with
an amusing and cinoyahie piece en.
titled The Dead Mali by John Zorn.
The works that followed were filled
with a great deal of tension that
evoked a range of feelings in the
listener. The pieces also reﬂected an
eclectic innolsti lesandsotinds that
often left the audience anticipating
the next change in music style. A
particularly striiing part of the per.
forniziiice was that the silences with-
in the pieces were iust asstunning as
the music itself. The second piece.
entitled “The Ecstasy" from Terry
Riley's Salome Dance: for Peace was
most impressive The final work of
the program. however was notewor.
thy in its deliberate nature and slur
plicity that was later taken apart by a
great sense of new found energy.
Mugam Sayagi was the highlight of
the evening and there is no question
why the Kronos Quartet would save

such an impressive piece tor the last

orthe program. However, thesc works
were the only pieces of music that
seemed to truly make a real impres—
sion within the program. The other
pieces, while beautifully performed,
were somewhat lacking in diversity;
at times it was hard for some Concm’t
goers to follow the pieces in the man.
ner that they would have liked.

While the musical skill and tal.
em or Kronos members was greatly
appreciated, some concertgoers were
disappointed with what theysawas a
lack oivariety in the program itself.
Audience merrihers who were famil—
iarwithihe work ofthe Kronosouai.

greater range oiworts than what was
presented. Some students also ques—
tioned whether Kronos was commit.

the Kronos performance. The sound

of the space in the front of Herrick.
The lighting setup was elaborate in
comparison with other Herrick
events and reﬂected the importance
placed on the Kronos Quartet's pres—

ence on the orinnell campus. The
lighting effectively embodied the
character of the music. The colors
and luminescence of the lights were
perfectly molded With the tenor of
the works, representing the frequently
changed musicaldirectionwithinthe

ally good repertoire, sound and light.
ing made the Kronos Quartet perfob

concertgoer.
