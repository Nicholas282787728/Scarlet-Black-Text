Recently Delta Phi’s four thousand odd meme
bcrs acquired r shiny new talking point for rush-
ing. Brother Stanley Forman Reed (Kentucky
Wesleyan '02) was made an Associate Justice of
the U, 5, Supreme courr, replacing George
Sutherland, retired.

One day three years ago Justice Sutherland
had been looking down rather coldly on rm; Delta
Phi. U. s. Solicitor General Reed was arguing the
constitutionality of the AAA and Bankhead Act,
deftly trying to wln his ninth court victory for rhe
New Deal. Suddenly he sagged and was supported
out of the chamber. It was rhe ﬁrst good srory
newspapcrmen had been able to get from the
portly Kentuckian, king-pin {or ﬁve years in the
New Deal‘s legal phalanxes. Reed had given way
ro overwork.

The new Justice's habit of working hard began
at Kentucky Wesleyan and kept him pounding at
learning through Yale, the University of Virginia
law school, and the Sorbonne in Paris. Thus pre-
pared, natively diligent and capable, this only son
of a prosperous Maysville, Ky., doctor had no
difﬁculty clzmbering up in his profession from
private practice to a Washington career rhar began
in 1929 when, though a Democrat, he was called
to help Herbert Hoover.

Under rhe robes of the U. S. Supreme Court
Stanley F. Reed will ﬁnd the privacy he has sought
in 53 years of hard work, years :0 which he has
given most of his hair.
