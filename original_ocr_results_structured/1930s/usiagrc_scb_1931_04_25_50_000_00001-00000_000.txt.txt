Interscholastic

Powerful Teams Prospect

for Twenty-Fourth
Annual Meet

Track coach G. Lester Duke said
today that he expects “the cream of
the Iowa high school track and ﬁeld
athletes" here for the twenty-fourth
annual Crinnell Interscholastic meet.
May 2,

By a special vote of the Honor
G club Monday night. it was decided
that the club should again back the
invitational meet it sponsored for
the ﬁrst time 23 years ago. Coach
Duke has been asked to act for the
club in inviting the more powerful
of the Iowa schools to compete

The ofﬁcials for the meet have not
been deﬁnitely announced yet, nor
have all of the entry blanks for the
events and teams been returned.

Eoivson May Ofﬁciate

Royce Minier, president of the
Honor G club, said today that Charlie
Rawsan, a member of the board of
trustees of Grinnell college, had been
asked to act as referee at the meet,
but his answer had not been received.

Coach Duke prophesied that there
would be some new records made in
the meet this year if the weather per-
mits any kind of speed and skill. The
records for the shot put. polevault,
high jump, discus, javelin, mile relay,
and 120 yard high hurdles all seem
to he in danger.

Competitors Show Class

The ottumwa team has a man who
has been doing time which has hov-
ered consistently near the hurdle
record of 16.2. Fairﬁeld and Crin-
nell have both been putting relay
teams over the mile course in time
desperately close to the meet record
of 3:34. La Marr, of Stuart, has
been vaulting around the 11 foot
mark. Madsen, of Ames, and Kiesey.
of Washington, have been doing bet-
ter at their respective events of high
jump and jevelin throw than the meet
records, and can be expected to show
some real class in their events at the
meet.

The shot putter on the North high
school team of Des Moines has been
heaving the ball almost a foot past
the meet record, and Parrott. of
Mason City, 1931 winer in the discus
throw, may be back in an effort to
break the record of 127 feet, 3%
inches set in 1923 by Rinefort of
Grinnell.

Meals in Dormitories

Entertainment for the vlsiting
teams will he handled as in the past.
Meals will be served free of charge
to all contestants and coaches at the
man's dormitories. Friday night lodg-
ing will be furnished to teams travel-
ing a greater distance than 60 miles.

Ofﬁcials of the Honor G club have
been predicting success for the meet,

Article by Prof. Canard
in [last Literary Digest
on Giant African Flower

Looks are sometimes deceiving,
and names are, too, believes Henry
S. Conard, professor of botany. In the
April 25 issue of the Literary Digest,
Mr. Canard tells of a double-dyed dc-
ception which a ”sacred African lily”
recently played upon him.

In the first place, the giant flower
is neither a lily nor African and to
clinch the evidence, anybody who
once smelled it would hesitate to call
it sacred. This latter statement can
be wholeheartedly substantiated by
Professor Conard’s botany classes,
who permitted discretion to get the
better of valor, and ﬂed the labora-
tory when the pugent odor of the
posy circulated through it.

The plant causing the gas attack
is a relative of the calls lily and the
Jeck-rn-thepulpit, but sends its
single flower-stalk to the height of
a grown man. It is cultivated to a
small extent as an oddity, but is Sela
dom seen in bloom, which Professor
Conard believes fortunate.

Only Six Lettermen Left to Form
Nucleus of Next Year’s Grid Team

With only six lettermen to form a
nucleus for the 1931 edition of the
Grinnell college football team, Conch
L, L, (Fuzz) Watt will have a difﬁ-
cult task in creating a winning team.
He will have a veteran backﬁeld, but
Captain Chrislofferson, center, and
Charles Bilto, twoeyear end veteran,
are the only returning linemen,

Coach Watt will have several Sophr
ornores and several reserves from
last year, however. End positions
are particularly well fortiﬁed with
Bilto, Edman, Murphy, and G012 re—
turning, in addition to Crews and Mc-
Kee, who played together on the lo-
cal high school eleven.

Two outstanding tackle prospects
are Mark Trumbull and Austin Can-

avan, both of whom showed good
form last fall, Behrens, Bowlby, and
Lake will also be available.

Figland and Martin have seen
service as reserve guards, and Er»
win, Rosenbloom, and Cleysteen, a
trio of promising men from the 1930
frosh team, will take care of the
middle of the line. Faun e and Simms
will be available for center.

3 Coach Watt will have a number of

backs with whom to work, including
the four lettermen, Thomas, Ullrich.
McCreary, and Craﬁund. James will
see some action, since he showed up
well in spring football practice.
Waite and Rose are the most out
standing yearling backs. while Santi,
Loynachan, Singer, and Hemphill will
also report,

der consideration by the general com-
mittee on Commencement exercises,
