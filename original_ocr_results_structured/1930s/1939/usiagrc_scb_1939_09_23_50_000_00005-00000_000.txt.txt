Deserted‘Libe’ Out of Running
Until Rains and Reports Begin

By Aline While.
lAn appreciative audience was
only our unholy inclination to yell
and keep on yelling, Perhaps it’s
young love. Most likely it's thel
too, too scholarly atmosphere in‘
that building between the chapel‘
and a. R. H. Anyway, the libe
just ain't got it. While its pa-
trons (the little brain-trusts)
wander far afield these warm and
sunny days Shakespeare
sleepily on his shelves and Milton
mourns under the dust which has
as yet been unmoved by weary
student hands. l
The Reader's Guide stands stole
idly on its tables with not even
a stair squeak to comfort it, for
the stair squeak belongs to the
glories of yesteryear. The swing-
ing doors of yore are stilled, and
the buzz of stage whispering
(once a lihe tradition) is a thing
of the past. Even the steadies
have sought other elimes to woo,
and the corners where a bachelor
Wasn’t safe are now as open as
the air. If we don't watch out,l
the librarians, like the books, will
he dusty from disuse. i

In other words, the library and
everything therein misses us chil-
lun and earnestly prays for rain
to make the ground unsate for
blanket parties, for the English
department to pass out those
keen research assignments, and»
for a general scholastic revolu-‘

tion to take place on the campus.‘
Then it will be happy.
