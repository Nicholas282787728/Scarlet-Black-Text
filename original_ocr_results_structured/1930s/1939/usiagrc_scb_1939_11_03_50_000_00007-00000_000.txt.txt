The eighty/Jive piece Illinois
Symphony orchestra, which will

pel next Thursday evening under
the sponsorship of Grinnell col-
lege in cooperation with the Illi—
nois music project, will be con-
ducted by lzlcr Solomon and feat-
ure Herman Clebanoff as violin
soloist.

Solomon, who is only 23 years
of age, first attained recognition
in music circles as a violinist,
Later he turned to conducting and
has emphasized the presentation
of seldomehenrd masterpieces and
new compositions by American
composers.

During the past summer, Solo-
mon was featured on a nation-
wide radio hook-up conducting the
NBC orchestra on several broad~
casts during Toscannini’s absence
in Europe.

The limited seating capacity
of Herrick chapel has caused the
'admission to the concert to be by
special ticket only. staff tickets
and semester fees may be ex~
changed for this ticket at the
treasurers office before Wednes-
day at 4:30 p. m.

Va'gner Organizes
Five Inslrumen’ral
Groups in Band

Four instrumental quartets and a
brass sextet are being organized
from the Grinnell college band,
according to Robert vagner, di-
rector.

These groups are primarily to
provide enjoyment and experience
for the members, and may occa-
sionally play in chapel.

The band naw has a definite
system of points and awards that
will carry throughout the year.
This system of points will give
band members a chance to make
up any loss of credit by partici»
pating in extra band activities.

Making a meal in the dorms SCEmS
like 3. faculty tea, the first coed
Hallowe'en party in two years
was held in the Quad dining-
room Tuesday night and featured
tracking on the aisles by the il-
lustrious feminine members of
the faculty, games of tag amidst
the waiters, and numerous pa—
rades by spooks up and down the
aisles of the “dinning" room.

The brawl was a l'abl‘ace from
beginning to end, and proved to
be a headache for all concerned,
except the participants, who were
in a state of unalcoholic drunk-
enness and therefore not conscious
of anything except their own ex»
uberance.

Undoubtedly, honors for the
best performance should go to
Dean Evelyn Garnder, who, while
dancing among a bevy of beauti-
ful babes, excuse us, faculty
members, proved that she could
truck right up there with the
best of them. Another great per-
formance was turned in by Ermina
E. Busch, assistant registrar.

In the middle of the first
course, Harms and Alexander,
two of the Hsincs hill billies, be-
came involved in a major battle
and decided to fight to the finish

poured the water off the tray _ ,
to the offending l'l'liss' ncck.

According to all reports, Redd,
featuring “Read Between the
Lines," was rather disgusted
with the whole affair; for rather
than basing appeal on rowdin ss,
the Readites stressed quietness
and subtleness, and general in
conspicutiveness, and were there-
fore pushed back into a corner
by their boisterous colleagues.

When the, affair was concluded,
and the ruffians went home to
bed, everyone was happy, except
the “suckers" who were appoint
ed to clean up the mess.

Homecoming again. Prepare your-
self, if you haven't already done
so, to give up bed and board and
let the old grads take the. reins.
They’ll do it anyway, so you
might as well be ladies and gen-

tlemen about "

first

I don’t know what there is about
this place that gets 'em. But
year after year, they stagger back
“home” to alma mater—to the
moth-eaten gyms, the antiquated
attitudes and traditions, and the
ironclad ”social system." Maybe
it's that “come ye back to old
Grinnell" number the men's glee
club sings soulfully enough to
makc 'cm weep. Anyhow, it’s
homecoming again. Let us be
gay!

The campus should brighten up
about eleven Saturday night as
soon as three of the college's most
vociferous females, currently
playing the first. second, and
third dead woman, are released
from “Our Tawn.”

it the snow that was Sllml'illg
earlier this week had only kept
snowing, we would have had a
chance to remark that iL‘d be
tough sledding for the Pioneers
tomoriow But the weather is as
fickle as several people of our
acquaintance.

They did it up in 51 very swell
cove -salmon pink and all that
~rthls new herd book. Em. you
know where it puts us, don’t
you? The only thing the authore
ities overlooked was a nice big
“a" on that black ball on the
cover. By the time a guy is old
enough to vote 'he has the right
to forget his "middle" namEV-if
he can. He daesn't expect to
have it plastered all over the
Campus and the lord knows where

 

at all‘ even if calling up a gal
sounds like a gabler’s nightmare
>>even if they distributed the
herd book while we weren't look—
ing, our eyesight having failed

Homecoming this year is, 'n the
last analysis, nothing nei . We‘ve
had such luminaries as Freddie
Luther, “568g“ Seeger, Bernard
(Booful) Bailey, and Harry High
around frequently this yeal'ito
say nothing of occasional visits
from “Angus" Ferguson, “Speed"
Wilson, and Harry McDuff, Dee
and Johnny Hayward aren’t exA
actly strangers around hereior
orphii Sherman, or Liz Lyman, or
Verlainc Monrhealli We‘ oughta
be used to the 'idea by this time.
