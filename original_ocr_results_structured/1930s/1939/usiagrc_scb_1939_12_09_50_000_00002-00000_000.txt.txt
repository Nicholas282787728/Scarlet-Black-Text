Saturday,

BEGIN HERE, MR. DIES!

First, it’s smallpox, Then it’s measles. And
now it’s the Honorable Martin Dies.

For according to a recent release from
the Associated Collegiate Press, the govern»
,lnent’s one-mall wave of destruction of all
things un-Amcrican has announced that he’ll
soon turn the inquisitorial orb upon U. S.
colleges and univcr lcs in holy quest of a
long-suspected assortment of student and
professorial bombrthrowers and subversive
elements.

But is he ever going to be unhappy, ac—
cording to the aforementioned release.

Already, it seems that every college
paper in the country has trotted out the
eighteen-inch editorial batteries, found the
unfortunate Mr. Dies squarely in the sights,
and yanked the firing cords. (Poor fellow,
nobody understands the noble objectives
which motivate his untiring researches into
the activities of those individuals and organ
izations which are at this very moment
plotting assassination and revolution.)

As for us, we welcome this new activity
of the congressman, only wishing that the
inquiry might begin on this campus.

For where among our American colleges

and universities can one find more evidence
of Red and Nazi influence than here at Grill-
nell? It is common knowledge that the
teaching is shot through and through with
those dangerous doctrines. Why, a couple
of professors even think that there are a
few Germans who are not outright barbar-
ians. And there are several instructors who
feel that the working man should have a
fighting chance for a decent living.

And think of the subversive influences
that have insinuatcd themselves into the
student body! The cooperative movement,
for instance. Some students on this campus
are actually sympathetic toward this un-
American idea. And there are two or three
fascist—minded individuals who believe that
the Nazis are not wholly to blame for the
current European war. But what is worse,
there are even those who expressed loyalty
to the ideals of the late Spanish loyalists!

Quick, quick, Mr. Dies. We need your
help. Or Grillnell will set up a dictatorship
of the proletariat!

UNCLE SAM’S DINNER

Next Wednesday night, December 13, the
dormitory dining room will be the scene of
a rather unusual dinner. At that time,
seventy-five towll boys, between 10 and 15
years old, will be the guests of all equal num-
ber of college men, who have asked to be
allowed to treat them to a real meal. The
occasion is the annual Uncle Sam’s Club
Christmas dinner, put on under the auspices
of the club by the college Y. M. C. A. The
dinner has always been a. great success ill
the past for two reasons.

The first reason why the Uncle Sam’s
dinner has been so successful ill the past is
to be found ill the boys themselves. Coming
up to college for a dinner with the older
fellows is a big treat for them. Alld they
don’t hesitate to show that they’re happy to
be there, to meet their hosts, and to have
a chance to put away what often is their
only square meal for many a long day. Even
their college hosts are bewildered (but no
less delighted) at the size of their appetites.
Their obvious enjoyment of the evening has
helped make the dinner the hit' it has al—
ways been with guests and hosts alike.

This brings us to the second reason for
the popularity of this annual affair. The
college luen really enjoy entertaining the
boys. It’s fun to watch them eat It’s in—
spiring, too, to see how such underp vilegcd
little fellows manage to be so enthusiastic
ill their outlook on the rest of the world.
It‘s a rare privilege to buy a dinner for
someone who appreciates it so wholeheart—
edly and needs it so badly as these Uncle
Sam’s Club boys do. The hosts always get
as mucll pleasure out of the meal as their
guests do, and in this case, that’s quite a
statement.

OPEN FORUM

To the Editor.

Pointing fingers won’t help.

Lest this war of words go on
all winter, may an old fuddyr
duddy of an alumnus say a few
words about football players vs,
coach vs. student body. Whether
it was coaching, or lack of it;
student spirit, or lack of it: foot-
ball playing or lack of playing7
the season is gone.

Mistakes probably have been
made. Basketball season is on us,
and the best thing for Grinnell
college will be aloyalstudont sup,
port of a well coached basketball
team of players who give their
best to win—at leust to playwell.
\Vith this in mind, let’s have it—
and, incidentally, that might have
a lot to do with a certain need for
a better place in which to play
basketball and sou it played. Also,
looking further into the future,

that will mean a better aeldetlc
spirit and record for soarlct and
black teams.

However, the spirit of the cam—
pus will have the most to do with
this present and future situation.
That‘s of course just the opinion
of one oldrtimer who has ‘seen
underdog Grinnell teams come out
on top in years gone by.
