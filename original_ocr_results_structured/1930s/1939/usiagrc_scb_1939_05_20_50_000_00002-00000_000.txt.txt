MINDING OUR OWN BUSINESS

“Let’s keep out of Europe’s quarrels. We
should be minding our own business," say
a large group of people. The United States
News furnishes us with some pertinent
statements in regard to this cry, and we
take the liberty to paraphase a few of them.

(1) We can “mind our own business” and
forget that the rest of the World is sup-
posed to furnish a livelihood for 5,000,000
persons in the South interested in cotton.
(2) We can “mind our own business” and
forfeit $2,000,000,000 worth of manu-
factured exports and close down on 2,000,-
000 jobs. (3) We can “mind our own busi-
ness" and neglect $6,500,000,000 worth of
private American investments abroad bring-
ing American citizens $250,000,000. (4)
We can “mind our own business" and lose
the market for 50 per cent of ollr tobacco
and 20 per cent of our wheat. (5) We can
“mind our own business" and pay exorbi-
tant prices for tin and rubber.

(6) We can “mind our own business” and
detach ourselves from monetary problems
and let manipulation of foreign currencies
upset our trade. (7) We can “mind our own
business" and start bolstering domestic
prices by means of greater and greater
government interference in business, great-
er and and greater regimentation of life.
(8) We can “mind our own business” and

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

let millions of industrial and farm workers
fall back on the already overcrowded labor
market. (9) We can “mind our own busi-
ness” and remain supremely indifferent to
the possible break-down of the British Eni-
pire, the French Republic, the independence
of Holland, and the immense disruption of
markets. (10) We can “mind our own busi—
ness” and sec profits in American industry
grow Smaller and smaller as budget burdens
of government grow larger.

Are the isolationists fully aware of the
implications of their present program? Do
they really know what it means to ”mind
our own business?”

“Minding our own business” lies in parti-
cipating in every international effort toward
world cooperation, in speaking often and
with calm and reasoned voice to all peoples
in hope of assuring peace, and finally in be-
ing willing to utilize our gold, our immense
resources, and our surpluses to help the
world back to sanity.G

GETTING AN EDUCATION?

Periodic charges are hurled at college stu-
dents accusing them of wasting their oppor—
tunity to secure an education. Just last
week, Dr. E. F. Carpenter, teacher of astro-
nomy at the University of Arizona, made
the observation that present-day college stu-

dents are strangely uneconomical in ac~,

quiring their education. They try to get as
little as possible for their money. While
the accusation is directed at the college stu-
dents in general, we might well assume that
the accusing finger is pointed at each of us
individually and ask ourselves the larger
question of whether we are getting an edu-
cation.

Are we as individual students getting
what we should out of our attendance at
Grinnell? And, since education is a co-
operative enterprise, are we doing our part
in the advancement of our education?

Here are a few direct questions which
each college student should ask himself,
and answer for himself. (Some of these
questions were proposed recently in a sym-
posium, the title of which was borrowed for
this editorial).

Am I learning to evaluate and appreciate?
Am I sensitive to things that are Signifi-
cant, beautiful, superior, and enduring? Am
I active not only in enjoying the world
around me but in making my own life
creative, graceful and fine?

Is college making of me a responsible
person capable of meeting my own prob-
lems of every-‘day living? IS college giving
me experience in the responsibilities of lo-
cal, national, and world citizenship, or is
college isolating me from the social prob-
lems wllich exist across the street and be-
yond the campus?

Am I growing in physi al well»bcing, in—
tellectual breadth, and spi 'tual depth? Am
I being educated for freedom, for self-dis-
covery, for originality? Am I cultivating
the right habits of efficiency, honesty, and
critical judgment?

‘ Frankly, now, am I contributing as much
time and effort and energy as I should to
get the kind of education I want? Or am
I wasting much of my opportunity.

idea that publications must be
conducted primarily in the interest
of the student body, and not as a
means for permitting any particu-
lar students or organizations to
make as much money as possible
out of them."

Most servo students.

”The Crinnell Chamber of Com-
merce has recently stated that its
members desire to support with
advertising worthwhile student
publications, but that they feel
that they have been solicited for
advertising for too many things
that have been of no real service
to them," Colbert continued.

“This statement supports the
contention of the Faculty Com-
mittee on student organizations

 

and Publications and of the puhli
cations board that the number of
publications should be limited to
those serving a real purpose in
order that these may receive ader
quate support.”

Requests Due.

“In many cases it is essentiall
that a publication be approved and
perrect its organization and plans
during the summer if it is to have
a successful year. it is necessary,
therefore, that requests for {Job
mission to publish he prepared and
delivered to the board at its meet—
ing the latter part of next week in
order that due consideration may
be given,” he emphasized.

“It is the intention of the boardl
to furnish the Grinnell merchants
with a list of approved publica4
tions, together with a notice to
the effect that the solicitation of
advertising for any but approved
publications is without sanction,"
Colbert concluded,

OPEN FORUM

To the Editor:

The organization of a speech
fraternity on the Grinnell campus
is another indication that this
"outpost of culture among the
cornstdlks” is still a leader in
progressive education.

Rather than have irresponsiblc
individuals g0 “woolrgathering
among the Grinnell sheep." we
now have an organization which
will be able to stimulate intelli-
gent discussion in an understand-
able way in the vast fields with
which all Grinncll students are

‘concerned.

Too long has Crinhell been
haphazard and unorganized in its
attack on campus problems. Now
that a responsible organ is es-
tablishcd to guide and direct cams
pus thought, “Grinnell can go
ahead and look to the future with
confidence."
