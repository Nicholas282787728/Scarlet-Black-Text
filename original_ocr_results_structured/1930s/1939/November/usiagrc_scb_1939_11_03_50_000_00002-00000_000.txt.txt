Missing Shirl Leads

On Bloody Trail +0 Seamslresses

The "bloody shirt" was missing
from its place of honor Tuesday.
There was a great gap in the
back of the trophy case where the
aforementioned article of apparel,
worn by one of the players in
the first football game here fifty
years ago. had formerly hung out.

Foul play was suspected, espe—
cially by the reporter who was
assigned to write a story on the
shirt and couldn't find it. It (lee
veloped, however, that Athletic
Director Truesdale had taken the
shirt. Further inqu s revealed
the fact that Athletic Director
Truesdale had given the shirt.
The “glvee” turned out to be one
of the pep squad girls. So we
went over to the quad to find
her and, we hoped, the shirt.

Eureka! It was found! What.
we wanted to know, was the holy
bloody shirt doing in the hands
of the pep squad” Sacrilegei The
first shirt west of the Mississippi
being detiled by the Women? Our
tears, fortunately, were for naught.
The pep squad assured us that the
sanctity ot the shirt was being
preserved, and that it (the shirt)
was merely being used as a model.
A model for what. we asked. ”A
model,” gritted the gals, “for
eleven more of the blankety-blanir
things that we've gotta make lic-
tore Saturday.” Flying their nee-
dles industriously, the gals were
fashioning carbon copies of the
shirt, to be worn by an “Iowa
team" that will play between
halves of the homecoming game.

There was, the reporter noticed,
only one thing lackinginamﬂy,
blood. But that was undoubtedly
in the eyes of the fair ones forced
to sew ﬁne seams for the loot-
ballers.
