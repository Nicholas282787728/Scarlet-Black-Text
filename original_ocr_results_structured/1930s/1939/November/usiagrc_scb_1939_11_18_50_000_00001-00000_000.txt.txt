Today's college graduate is a bet-
ter recruit for business than was

Beach, .lr., personnel manager of
the du Pont Company, in an ad»
dress before the Association of
Land Grant Colleges and Univer-
sities recently. Mr. Eeach assert
ed that, “intellectually and tem—
peramentally, he surpasses his
predecessors.”

The du Pont official named
four specifications most desired
by industry in its college re-
cruit- High academic standing,
part ipation in extra-curricular
activities, good appearance, and
an adaptable temperament.

“The first of these,‘ said Mr.
Beach, "is academic standing.

B j Neglecting Religion’ Asserts Luccoc/(j

“I do not see how anyone who
has lived in the normal touch of
life in this country can fail to
admit that without recognition of
relig‘on, there is presented a bad»
ly distorted picture of life,” flee
clared Dr. Halford E. Luccock,
in the fourth Gates lecture, giv-
en in Herrick chapel Wednesday
night.

Dr. Luccock pointed out the
breach between the writers and
religion, claiming that 32 per
cent of the authors were found
to believe in a God to whom they
could pray, while 62 per cent did
not believe in such a deity. “Re-
ligion does not lend itself to the
dramatic," the Yale professor
asserted. “It is much more excit—
ing to describe an explosion than
to tell of the eftect of oxygen in
the atmosphere,

Discussing the plays, poetry,
and novels of the past decade,
the speaker pointed out how er-

 

fective writing can be on behalf
of religion. ”In spite of the rathe
er strong tendency toward world~
ly literature, the argument on
the side of the child of God will
never be wholly without the sup
port of literature."

“Some Evaluations of the De-
pression Decade,“ was the title of
the fifth and final Gates lecture
held Thursday morning in Here
rick chapel.

"Hollywood," Luccock said.
“has been the greatest dentist of
modern times, pulling the teeth
of inyriads of books and plays
which it has attempted to repro-
duce, and has left only toothless
wrecks in their stead.”

Pointing out that poetry, liter—
ature, and drama have a subju—
gating tendency upon the develop-
ment of religious influences, Luc—
cock said, “.A counter-tendency of
faith, sentiment, and mankind is
slowly developing,"

Crinnell college, looking its best
of the season, defeated a highly
touted Coe college eleven here this
afternoon 13 to e.

In a game marked by a fight in
the closing minutes of the fourth
quarter, the Pioneers won their
final game of season through the
aid of Harry Barker, who was in
on both touchdown plays.

Barker Scores.

A few minutes before the end
of the first half, Barker, who
played the game of the day,
plunged over into pay dirt from
the four yard line, and Shelton's
placement was good to send the
Pioneers into a 7 to 6 lead.

The Coe college Kohawks drew
first blood by scoring in the first
five minutes of the second quan
ter. With the ball resting on
Grinnell’s 46 yard marker, Kincb,
Kohawk star took the hall on
two successive plays to chalk up
six points for the Cedar Rapids
eleven. Leins attempted place—
ment went wide of its mark.
second Score Made.

The scarlet and black clad war-
riors second touchdown started
when Grimes blocked a coe punt,
and it became Gl‘lnnell‘s ball on
about the midfield stripe. With
Harry Barker chucking passes all
over the field, the hall was soon
inside the 10 yard line. From
here Barker passed into the arms
of Cause, reserve end, for the
six points. Keehn's placement was
blocked,

Barker and Walters were the
leading men in the Grinnell hack-
ﬁeld, while Grimes and Gause
were the stalwart men of the line.
