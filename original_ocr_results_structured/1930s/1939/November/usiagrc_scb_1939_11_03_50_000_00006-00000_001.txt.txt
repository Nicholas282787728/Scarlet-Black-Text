Presentation Gives

Simple Events in
Small Town Life

By Nancy McMun-ay.

With the presentation oi what
Brooks Atkinson, noted drama
critic, calls ,“one of the finest
achievements of the current
stage. Thornton Wilder's “Our
Town," the drama department
adds its part to the homecoming
program. The play will be pro-
duced tonight and tomorrownight
in the auditorium of the Alumni
Recitation hall at 8:15 p. in,

To quote Mr. Atkinson, "Tak-
ing as his material three periods
in the history of a placid New
Hampshire town, Mr. Wilder
has transmuted the simple events
of human life into universal rev-
erie, He has given familiar facts
is deeply moving, philosophical
perspective It is as though Mr.
Wilder were saying: 'Now for ev-
idence as to the way Americans
were living in the early part of
the century, take Grovers Corners,
N. H., as an average town.
Mark it "Exhibit A" in American
folkways, and we see three peri-
ods in the career of one genera-
tion of Grovers Corners folks—
“Daily Life,” “Love" and
“Death".

Normal Life Presented,

“ iterally, they are not impor-
tant. On one side of an imagine
ary street Dr. Gibbs and his fam-
ily are attending to their hum-
drum affairs with relish and prob-
ity. 0n the opposite side Mr.
Webb, the local editor, and his
family are fulfilling their quiet
destiny. Dr. Gibbs' boy falls in
love with Mr. Webb’s girlillclgh-
hors since birth. They marry after
graduating from high school; she
dies several years later in child-
birth and she is buried on Come
tery Hill. Nothing happens in the
play that is not normal and nat-
ural and ordinary.

“But by stripping the play of
everything that is not essential,
Mr. wilder has given it a pro‘
found, strange, uiuvorldly sign
canoe This is less the pol ‘all'.
of a town than the sublimation
of the commonplace; and in con-
trast with the universe that si-
lently swims around it, it is brim—
ming over with compassion, Most
of it is a tender idyll in the
kindly economy of Mr. Wilder's
literary style; some of it is hcart—
breaking in the mute simplicity
of human tragedy. For in the
last act, which is entitled ‘Death’,
Mr. Wilder shows the dead of
Grovers Corners sitting peaccful-
ly in their graves and receiving
into their quiet company a neighs
bar's girl whom they love. so
Mr. Wilder’s pathetically humble
evidence of human living passes
into the wide beyond. Grovers
Corners is a green corner of the
universe.”

Formalit-y Eliminated.

To present this simple and
beautiful story and to keep out
any obliterating formalities of
the accepted stage, the author
has written his play to be pro-
duced without scenery and with
as few stage properties as pos-
sible. The curtain is up for the
