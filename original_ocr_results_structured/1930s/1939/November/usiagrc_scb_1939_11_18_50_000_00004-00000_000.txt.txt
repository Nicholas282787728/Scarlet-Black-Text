‘6’ Club QueIIs
Minor Uprising
On Prep Caps

By William Buckley.

Getting into the swing for the
first time since the advent of the
193940 school year, the Men’s
Honor ‘G' club, local \clothing-
store organization, sponsored a
social gathering for all the first
year men Thursday night in the
Clark hall clubroom. -.

The meeting featured lions
hearted Paul Anderson, Macy
house resident, who doubted the
legality of the letter-men charging
one dollar for a prep cap, which,
according to Anderson, sells for
seven cents wholesale.

The Honor 'G’ did everything
within their power to convince
him otherwise.

Anderson’s voice of dissension
was raised after Max Shelton,
president of the organization,
asked if all the freshmen were
satisfied with the prep cap rul-
ing.

“No,” rang out Anderson’s
voice, electrifying the already
tense atmospheic of Clark hall
cluhroom Entertainment soon
followed.

Aside from Dauntiess Paul's
outbreak, the only other amuse-
ment afforded the Honor ‘G'
members present was taking care
of approximately ten other pie 5,
who went before the paddle. In-
dictment: Failure to wear prep
caps.

The meeting was called by the
Honor '6’ club because, in the
words of Shelton, “We are sick
and tired of all this fooling
around, and won’t take any more
of it.”

LITTLE IN HOSPITAL

George Little, senior resident of
Gates hall, is confined to the
Community hospital following a

THERE ARE FOUR TYPES

of tobaccos found in the more popular
cigarettes, namely. . . Bright, Maryland,

B nrley and Turkish.

ALL THESE TOBACCOS except Turkish (which is
bought direct from the planters in Turkey and Greece)
and Maryland (which is bought through sealed bids
under government supervision) are bought at public
auction, just like any other auction where you might

have bought 111 a table or a chair.

AT THE AUCTION SALE the tobacco is piled in
baskets weighing from about 100 to 500 pounds and
each purchaser buys all of his tobaccos by competitive
bidding for the particular piles he wants.

THE CHESTERFIELD BUYERS buy the best of
these mild ripe tobaccos for the Chesterﬁeld blend.
And it is Chesterﬁeld 5 Combination . . . the right amounts
of Burley and Bright. . . just enough Maryland . . and
just enough Turkish—that makes the big diiference
between Chesterﬁeld and other cigarettes.

IT IS BECAUSE of this combination
that Chesterﬁelds are COOLER, have
a BETTER TASTE and are DEFINITELY
MILDER. They are made of the world’s
best cigarette tobaccos. You can’t buy
a better cigarette.
