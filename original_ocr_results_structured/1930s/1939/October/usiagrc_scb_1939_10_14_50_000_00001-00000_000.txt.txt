Constitutional Revision Orgies

Create Confusion

The year of 1939-40 will undouht.
edly go down in the annals of
Grinnell’s history as the begin
ning of a new progressive er
"To heck with traditions,” is the
battle cry: Grinnell
nessed the end of two traditinns
last week, and a third custom is
scheduled to get the axe with
the elections of the men’s house
presidents next January.

In past years, the election of
the Student Council prexy has
always preceded the choosing of
the men's hall presidents. The
premise that the head of the
campus governing body should be
the cream of the senior crop has
governed this action.

However, this year, such will not
be the case, although no change
in the,previous order of elections

on Eiections

,was meant through last yea
lorgy of constitutional revisions.

The mix-up came about by the

almost annual

Grid Memorial

Class of ’40 Plans
Dedication Service
For Homecoming

The senior class yesterday voted
to supervise the erection and fi-
nancing of a memorial to com—
memorate Grinnell's fiftieth an-
niversary of football, at a spe-
cial meeting in the .Alumni Rec-
itation hall. The memorial is to
be dedicated on Nov. 4, as a part
of the homecoming program.
This year marks ~the golden
anniversary of the first game of
football played west of the Mis-
sissippi, when Grinnell (then
Iowa college) played the State
University of Iowa at Grinnell.

Location Decided.

The marker undertaken by the
class of '40 will be located be—
tween the south goal posts and
the track on Ward field. Three
flag poles are also planned to be
placed between the monument
and the track, according to Rob-
ert Holquist, president of the
class.

The financing of the project is
to be arranged by a one dollar
contribution from each member
of the senior class, aided by
other donations, it was unani—
mously decided by the members
of the class present at the meet-
ing,

Construction starts Soon.
The project will begin
time next week, Holquist said.
To be constructed of white ce-
ment, the base of the marker
will be a platform, 10 by 20
feet, consisting of three steps.
In the center will he placed a
truncated obelisk, also of white
cement, four feet high.

A bronze tablet will be im-
bedded in the top of the column
with an inscription of the event
and the dedication of the class of
'40.

Flag Poles Planned.

The center flag pole will he 40
feet high with two 30 foot poles
at each side. An American flag
will be flown on the taller pole.
The shorter poles will be used to
display the flags of the visiting
team and the Pioneers.

Press Convention

All right, they're gone. The Iowa

Awards for Service and Protection

$4.50 short on the money which
they had taken m for registra-

of childhood prayers, and a nastier
revision of the accounts, straight-

The “shecrest guts" award g’oes‘might be donated to a woman

one upstairs, and one down. She
stated she was prepared to take
in both boys and girls. “I'll ran
up and down stairs all night, to
keep them apart," she is rumored
to have said.

But say what we like about the
convention, it must be admitted
by all, that to be able to take a
general survey of incoming crops
for the next four years, did have
its more interesting sidehglits.
