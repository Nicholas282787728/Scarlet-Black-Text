A PARABLE 0N DISCIPLINE

There was once a solicitons mother whose
final injunction to her children upon leaving
them temporarily to themselves was, “And
above all things, don’t pllt beans up your
noses." Whereupon the children, fascinated
by the idea, went immediately and did con—
trariwise; and the mother came home to
find them howling.

But that is really only the beginning of
the story. The mother learned soon enough
that if she said “I disapprove" the children
listened respectfully and did what they
chose, and if she said “Don‘t” they disobey—
ed specifically and with gusto. So until
they were too big to be handled she said
“Don’t" first and spanked them afterward;
and it was when they were too big to be
spanked that she thought of the ten-dollar
fine and three weeks’ campus. It seemed
to be working so well that she wished she
had thought of it sooner; and the list of
Doll’ts and I (ll'suppl'ovcs grew increasingly
longer and more explicit. Then it was that
she noticed a change in her children; they
spent their time now standing in corners, in,
venting witty remarks, and griping. They
began hunting for more things to gripe
about; and they found them too. And then
after a while their mother saw that really
her children were not good, really good, in
spite of all hcl efforts to keep them from
being load and getting into mischief. And
she went fol th and rerellted.

YELLOW PAINT AND SOCIAL FUNDS

Despite the change from initial blandish—
ments to a protective reticence on the part
of the men's governing body and Pioneer
Hall, the odor of yellow paint still hangs
over the men‘s campus in the form of the
withdrawal of the social funds of all the
men’s halls.

That the paint-swabbing job was a most
inartistic example of collegiate vandalism is
obvious, but the wisdom of the action taken
by the administration and the house pre-
sidents, the withholding of the men’s social
allocations, is less evident. As for as can
be seen at present, any possible advantage
of this action would be in one or more of
three things: forcibly bringing the matter
before the minds of the students, imposing
a disciplinary measure upon the men. or at-
tempting to force the disclosure of the cul-
prits through social pressure.

Whatever advantage may have lain in this
step as a method of impressing the im—
poltance of the problem upon the men has
long since disappeared, yet the stoppage oi

the funds remains in force. Furthermore.
it is to be doubted that the action was the
most intelligent way to accomplish sllcll a
result in the first place. Surely, there was
little necessity to convert the students to
the realization that the paint incident was
not a joke but a piece of barbarlsnl.

And if the withdrawal of the funds is but
a temporary measure to impress that fact
upon our minds it is at best a futile gesture.
If, on the other hand, the withdrawal is to
be of a long duration, the harshness of the
action cannot help but destloy its pulpose
Is it necessary to lesolt to wlist slapping to
set folth the obvious seliousness of the
situation?

As for any possible value of the action as
a disciplinary measure, that, too, borders
upon the ridiculous. Since when has it been
the accepted thing to punish society for the
misdeeds of the individual? In short, if
punishment is the motive for the with-
holding of the funds, why should six halls
suffer for an incident which was the out-
growth of difficulties between only two of
those halls?

Finally, if the purpose of the council's
action was to force the disclosure of the
miscreant through social pressure, the effi-
cacy of the method ‘is open to grave doubt.
It is hardly natural to assume that, after
the hullhbaloo which has been raised and
the dire threats which have been made, any
normal person will declare himself as the
criminal; no, not even to release the social
funds. Would it not have been wiser to
have lulled the culprit into a false sense of
security by ignoring the incident, and then,
when “the joke became too good to keep,”
pounce upon him with a suitable punish-
ment?

With the aim of the council and the ad-
ministration we are in complete agreement,
bllt in the light of what is known at pre-
sent, it is extremely difficult to recognize
the validity of the method employed to
attain that goal,

OUR LIBRARY AND RESPONSIBILITY

The truism that campus welfare depends in
a large measure upon student cooperation is
abundantly illustrated here at Grinnell, as
indeed, it is at every other college and uni»
versity the world. over. Nowhere is this
illustration more stri ing than where the
library is chosen as the example. For if the
library is a good place to study, it is because
the people who are using it are cooperating
to make it so. If, on the other hand, the
library is noisy and studying there is diffi-
cult, that is because some of the students
are too thoughtless or too careless to do
their part ill keeping the rooms quiet. The
dividualism—even rugged individualismi
may have its place, but its place is most
emphatically not in the library. Cooperation
is essential there.

This year the library has the benefit of
two important physical improvements which
should help to reduce noise and confusion to
a minimum. In the first place, the steps
have been repaired so that they no longer
squeak and groan whenever anyone goes
up or down the stairs. Secondly, the corrir
dor between the A. R. H. and the library
has been shut off, thus ending a great deal
of traffic and eliminating another source of

noise

No matter how many physical improve-
ments ale made in the libraly, there is no
way to keep it even moderately quiet uith—
out the cooperation of the students who use

It 5 our liblaly, to use just about as we
wish and the lesponsibility for making it a
good place to study is, fairly enough, ouls
too Let’s decide that this year we le going
to take an intelligent, cooperative attitude
toward all our responsibilities If we are to
have any freedom ill campus affairs, we
must show that we can use it wisely.

”The alelt and \lelI-b ba lanced student' lll this
extlaoldinaly em should live at once in the
past, the present and the future, because he
has a better chance for real perspective than
almost anyone else,” Robert Moses told
Union College students they should balance
present events against the strong lessons of
historical events.

Should Hitler’s
Peace Proposals
Be Considered?

By William C. Harris.

Last Friday, democracy's lime
liver plll, Herr Adolph Hitler.
gave himself a liberal dose of
feathers and blossomed forth as
the Almighty's right»hand angel
of peace.

Appearing before the Reich-
smg in a widely-heralded meetv
mg, der fuehrer set forth a
series of proposals which he
hoped would serve as a basis
for u [mace conference to end
ﬁle current European war.
Among the more important of
these proposals were the renum
clatloh of further territorial
claims, save for cnlonles, and a
declaration that Russia and
Germany should be re-estuhllsh-
cd upon ethniloglcal lines.

In spite of the [act that Hitler
scarcely seems at home in the
role of the Boeing dove of peace,
it is not impossible that his pro~
position may be of some value.
or course, all the Nazi-haters on
both sides of the Atlantic imme-
diately screecn that the dictator's
word isn't worth a tlnker‘s dam,
and that the best thing England
and France can do is continue
their preparations to clean his
clock, But leaving prejudice out
of the picture for the moment and
considering the plan objectively,
We can see at least two reasons
why Hitler’s call for a peace con-
ference should be given serious
consideration,

Reason number one: Both
sides seem to be pretty well
niraid of each other, and that’s
h great advantage. It means
that, at present, the opposing
powers are fairly well-matched,
and probably will have a heal—
llly respect for each other’s
opinions at a. conference table.

And that’s llnportant. Harem-
fore, either Germany has been
scared anemic of the allies, as a:
Versailles, or the allies have been
lull of fear and quaking’ at Hltr
ler's armed might, as at Munich.
The result has been that the
countries of Europe have been un-
able to reach a lasting agreement,
for no peace can be lasting which
is dictated by one side. Now,
however, with both camps so
wellrmatched, neither side is go-
ing to impose llS demands upon
the other.

lhslehrl, it might be just pos—
sible that, being of equal might,
the two factions could, reach u
compromise which woqu come
oloser to justice than any peace
which would come ul; the end of
a long war and which would
embody the objectives of only
[be victorious side. An ideal-
istio hope, perhups, but one reu
(lering the program worth a
trial at least.

Reason number two for giving
Hitler's proposals a chance )5 one
which was presented at a recent
campus dlscusslon on international
affairs, that is, that Germany and
Russia have a natural interest in
dominating eastern Europe, with
far more of a right to do so than
has England a right to control
India or South Africa. (An opin-
loh which we have long held, but
have not dared to express until
we found at least one other per-
