Cordon Dudgeon Adams, Age 24 Days, May Become
Either President of U. S. or Prime Minister of Canada

 

Far from being a man without a
country, Gordon Dudgcon Adams,
age 24 days, the son or J. Alfred
Adams, instructor in zoology,
is a man wrtb two countries and
almost a third.

In this respect he is following
in the footsteps of his mother,
who for most of her life was a
citizen of two countries, then for
a brief six months automatically
became just a plain American
citizen, quickly reverted to her
dual citizenship and is now about
to become a plain American cit-
izcn again simply because Mr.
Adams makes application to the
Unitcd States District Court in
Dcs Moines today for United
States citizenship.

It is all very complicated. Unr

last no matter where horn, and to make a declaration of British

because he was born in Iowa City , citizenship.
nudgeon l shc says,
of the British citizen again, for 1 was

last month Gordon
Adams is also a citizen
United States. Until he is 21
years of age he will remain both
an American and a British tspe»
oifically a Canadian) citizen.

His mother, who was born in
Allahabad, India, became a double
harreled citizen when her par-
ents, Americans, registered her-
at the United States consulate.
She was British because of place
of birth. Then, after receiving
her early education at Allahabad,
she came to live in Iowa with her
grandparents, and to get a. col-
lege education at Ames.

There she became 21 years of
age and Just a simple United
States citizen because she failed

“I knew,
”that

however,"
I'll soon be a

to be married to Mr. Adams in
another six months.”

Now that Mr. Adams is become
mg a naturalized citizen of the
United States, Mrs. Adams will
again become a plain American
citizen. Not so the baby. The
father can't takc away from the
baby his British citizenship.

Gordon Dudgeon is at present
interested in two things, sleep
and milk. He doesn’t know that
in twenty-one years from now he
is going to have to make up his
mind about being a British sub-
ject, nor that he is by birth eligi-
ble to run for the presidency of
the United States.

grapha and campus views, eccent—

cluded in the social section, which
