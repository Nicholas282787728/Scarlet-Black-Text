The Business
Is Plenty Tough
Savs Ex-Editor

Walt Rowley of the Scarlet and
Black in commenting on his new
position as telegraph editor of the
Beatrice. Nebraska, Daily Sun.

After three weeks on the tele-
graph desk of the paper, Rowley
has come to the conclusion that
comparatively college journalism
is a "snap." His present work
schedule calls for five nine-hour
days and one twelve-hour stretch
each week.

With the European war ma-
chinesgunnl'ng into his ears via
two chattering teletypcs spewing
a constant stream of propagan—
da, contradictions, and incompre—
hensible names, Rowley has
found that there is little time
even to take a puff on a cigar-
ette, let alone chin with the so-
ciety editor, a la cinema concep—
tion of modern journalism.

Despite hectic days of copy
reading, editing, writing head—
lines and meeting deadlines,
Rowley complains of only one as-
pect of his new job. i “all
you can get to eat in this town
is steak and French fried pota~
toes."

First Pep Meeting Set
For Tomorrow Evening

The first pep meeting of the year
will be held tomorrow evening at
7:30 pm, on Ward field, according
to Jean Heinsen and Thorn Kohl.
campus pep chairmen.

The program will consist of
short selections by the band, sev-
eral brief speeches by members of
the coaching staff, and an intro-
duction of college songs and yells

 

to the new students!

 

College Band Obtains New Uniforms and Equipment;
New Dance Orchestra Makes Plans for School Year

 

Aided by new uniforms, new
equipment, new personnel, and
new spirit, the Grinnell college
band, under the direction of Rob-
ert Vagner, will start the new
year with recently acquired as—
sets representing cn investment
of almost $1,500.

For their first public appear»
ance, at the Carleton game, Sep-
tember 29, some 55 members of
the organization will march in
black serge, naval officer styled.
uniforms trimmed in scarlet and
white whipcord, complemented by
red and black caps.

Leading the band will be baton
twirlers in white and scarlet
satin uniforms. Uniforms will be
distributed at 4 p. in. tomorrow.

In addition, new sousapbones
and three street drums, the latter

furnished by the local post of the
American Legion, will go into
action.

“This year, we have a wealth
of material for a really fine
band," virgner declared, “and
with our new equipment, new in-
strumentalists, including out—
standing players from national
championship bands, and with
enthusiastic student support, we
should have an organization that
will compare favorably with the
best in the state."

A portion of the money used in
outfitting the band was obtained
through an increased appropria<
tion granted to the organization
by the Student Council. During
the school year, both the newly
organized dance band, the
"Swingmasters," under the direc—

tion of Sam Parzybok, and the
ticket sale of the GrinnellS‘imp»
son football game, will be used
to defray the expense of the new
equipment.

The new college dance orehes<
tr-a, “of at least nine pieces." has
already begun rehearsals. The
group has obtained all new music,
including many of Artie Shaw's
latest special arrangements, new
lighting equipment, and new
stands. In addition to playing at
numerous varsities throughout the
year, the orchestra will, accord-
ing to present plans, give forth
at a series of ten dances to be
held Wednesday afternoons from
3:45 to so p. m, in the women's
gymnasium.
