Poor Shooting,
Bad Floor 'Play

In Close Game

By Clark A. Smith.

Gl-illllell’s btlsketeel's won
their final lion-conference
game of the year last night,
when they nipped Iowa State
Teachers 29 to 25,

Coach Truesdale's inen won the
hard way as they had an off
night in shooting and frequent
ragged floor play. The Tutors
presented a lalge, stubborn and
aggressive outfit that never gave
the smaller Pioneers a moment's
peace throughout the contest,

In Gersema, the Panthers had
a center that stood 6 feet 8 inches
up into the ozone and kept his
defensive backboard bottled up
most of the evening.

The game started very slowly
with ragged floor play and wild
shooting on the part of both
teams With ten minutes gone and
the score only 3 to 5 in favor
of the Pioneers, the Tutors call-
ed time out.

Two baskets in succession by
Lofquist gave the visitors a short
lead as the plfly spesded up. How-
ever, with Jerry Fort hitting the
basket twice and Capt. Bob Berry
once, with his long shot, Grinnell
left the floor with a Is to 11 half
time lead.

Coach Nordley’s men came back
strong to start the final half with
four successive baskets in the
first seven minutes. Grinnell call-

16 to 19. With Fort, Luther and
Luick putting on a scoring spree,
the Pioneers forged into a 23
to 21 lead,

Desperate play on the part of
the Tutors closed the gap some-
what before the game ended, but
they were on the short cncl of
the 29 to 25 final score.

Lofquist and Close were the
best offensively for Iowa State‘
Teachers, counting 11 and seven
points respectively. For Grinnell,
it was the diminutive sophomore
forward, Jerry Fort, that stole
the show.

While his team mates were
having an off night in their
shooting, Fort countered 17 points.

Dancing Plan

Campus Committee
Points to Success
Of ‘Program’ Idea

Because of the success of program
dancing, at recent suggestion of
the campus social committee, at
the last of the men’s house par»
ties, the plan will be continued in
the coming dances sponsoredby
the social committee, it was
learned today from Paul Baichly,
campus social chairman.

“Program dancing is on ts way
back to Grinnell college," Buichly
stated. “Programs, formerly used
only as wailrhangings, will have
a definite use now.”

He expressed the dome that
other house parties will also use
the plan.

Thc plan first used at the last
0[ the men's house parties was
favorably received, according to
Baichly.

Programs were passed out to
members of the halls several days
in advance, and dances were
traded at this time.

At the house parties, each
dance was announced by the ore
chestra leader, preventing mix-ups
in changing dances.

Colleges' Profit.

In starting this basketball
tournament, the NCAA is at-
tempting to replace the tourna—
ment hold in Madison Square
Garden, New York City, and spam
sored by professional promoters
for their own profit and not for
the particular protit of the col-
leges.

Plans as yet are only tentative
with no definitc dates or tour—
nament sites set.

Profits from the tournament
would be given to the colleges
and to the NCAA to sponsor
baskctball as a part of the Olym-
pic program.

 

Vocations Leader Declares Days

Of Pep Talks Are Out of Date

By Charles Adams.

“The days of pep talking and
cmotional influcnccs as the doin-
inant factors in influencing the
selection of a life work are gone.
They are replaced by the need for
rational thinking in regard to the
choice of vocations."

This was the opinion of Prof
Harold v Gaskill, dean of the
division of industrial science at
Iowa State college, in an address
before the vocations forum ycss
tcrday afternoon.

Gaskill pointed out that the
world today is facing large and
significant social and economic
changes. These changes, he said.
will often affect a particular job
where they will not affect a field
as a whole.

”One must, therefore, orient
himself for a field rather than for
a specific Job. The greatest cause
of vocational maladjustment to-
day is a lack of specific informa—
tion about vocational fields, not an
insufficiency of education general—
1y," Gaskiil asserted.

He went on to point out that
even during the depths of thc de—
pression, there were some vocals
tional fields in which the demand
for men could not be supplied.

In conclusion, Gsskill cited
three requisites for vocational ad—
justment.

First, students must study the
trends in the different vocational
fields in order to determine both
