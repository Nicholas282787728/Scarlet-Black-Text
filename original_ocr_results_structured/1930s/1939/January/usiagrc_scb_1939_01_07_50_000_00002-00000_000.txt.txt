Council Disappointed.

In commenting upon the board's
action, Robert Moehl, president of
the Student Council said, “We
are very much surprised and dis-
appointed at the decision of the
board in regard to the proposed
publications plan, especially in
view of the overwhelming favor-
able vote by the student body.

“It was the opinion of the stu-
dent Council that both the trust-
ees and the faculty were dissate
isfied with the present publica-
tions set»up.

Answer to Objections.

"This plan was our answer to
their objections; and, in so far
as we can see, it is the only pos—
sible means the student body has
of assuring itself a more perman-
ent program in regard to publica-
tionS#especially the Scarlet and
Black and the Cyclone, senior an-
nual," Moehl pointed out.

“In so far as i know, the
trustees have not suggested any
alternative plan which would pro-
vide the student with these two
necessary college activities under
our ‘all-‘lncluslve' fee," Moehl con-
cluded.

Faculty Action.
Prior to the decision ot the

trustees, the proposal had been
approved in substance by the
Council of House Presidents, the
Student Council, the student board
o: publications, and the faculty
committee on student organiza.
tions and publications.

The faculty has voted in favm'
of the proposed expansion of the
student hoard of publications but
has deferred action on the propos—
ed iinancial plan,
ltrceii-es Student Approval.

In addition, the plan received
the approval of as per cent of

the more than 500 students vot-‘

ing on the proposal.

Under the publications plan,
which was drawn up by a special
committee appointed by the Stu-
dent Council, the present temper»
ary set-up for the financing of
the annual and the Scarlet and
Black would be replaced by per-
manent financing through adding
35 per year to each student’s fee.
Uniﬁed Control.

This fund would assure each
student of an annual without the
present $2 deduction from the
room deposit in addition to
strengthening the position of the

iScux'let and Black.

The plan also provided tor the
unified control of all student pub—
lications by the creation of a
new board operating in a stipei»
visory capacity.
