Prep Gridders
Show Promise in
Spring Prac‘l'ices

“Highlight of spring football
practice to date has heen the out
standing work by the freshman
members of the squad,” said
Coach Guy Lockabaugh yesterday
afternoon.

According to
Thomas carmody.
James Reynolds
Mathews are four-
suitable to execute the power
plays. All are big, strong, hard
runners and hard to tackle.

Best of the freshman passel-s
so far is Mark Mann. During the
daily passing drills he has shown
fine accuracy in finding receivers

Lookahaugh is also pleased with
the blocking, charging and tack-
ling of four freshman linemen,
Louie Gonias. Kenet Pea , Milo
Rundall and Gerald Grant.

ton passing,
