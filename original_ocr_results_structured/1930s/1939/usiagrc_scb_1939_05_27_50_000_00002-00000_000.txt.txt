A CHALLENGE!

To the average student in Grinncll college,
four dollars is equal to an investment, not
to a mere purchase. Last year, when the
subject of an annual was broached and the
plan was pushed by several of the more con—
scious members of the present junior class
to acceptance, there must have been a few
doubts raised as to the outcome of the vcn-
ture. ’

Wednesday night the great majority of
the students of Grillnell college felt that
they had made a profitable investment, not
only with the four dollars they had paid for
their Cyclone, but with the confidence that
they had given to the staff that made the
annual possible.

To the members of the class of ’40, the
Cyclone represents the pleasant fruits of a
hardworking, efficient staff. To the mem-
bers of the class of ‘41, and especially to
next year’s staff, it represents a challenge.

LET'S ALL CRIB

,All sorts of suggestions are again going the
rounds about “honor systems,” police sys-
tems, and other systems to do away with
cribbing and cheating on exams. We note
from a recent study that the midwest rates
the poorest of all in the effectiveness of so-
called honor systems. Alid we know from
experience that Grimicll has had little luck
in setting up honor systems and police sys—
tems. '

It is barely possible that we haven’t in-
vestigated enough systems to find the best
one suitable for adoption at Grinnell.
Therefore the following comments are
made with a view to stimulating such ills
ocstigation:

(1) We believe that competition for
grades stimulates cribbing and cheating.
No one likes to be at the foot of the class
with the likelihood of flunking. Hence the
cribbing.

(2) We believe that a grading system
based on grade levels such~as H, S, B, F,
P, NC, 0' A,_ B, C, D, NC, tends to foster a
competitive attitude,ga “I’m better than
thou” attitude. Hence cribbing to get into
a higher grade level. As an offset to this
we suggest only two grades S (satisfactory)
and U (unsatisfactory). Competition would
be cut to a minimum.

(3) We believe that faculty grading “on

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

a curve" pits student against student, fos-
ters competition. Hence the cribbing to
get 21 higher place on the curve. As 21 better
way we suggest the complete abolition of
the grading curve.

(4) We believe that our examinations en-
courage cribbing. It is almost impossible to
do away with exams, but our examinations
could be “open book” exams and cribbing
and cheating would be unnecessary. Let
students take all the books, notes, cribs, etc.
that they wish to an exam. This would re-
quire a different type of exam, a thought
provoking type rather than a factual type.
It requires more work to make out and
more work to co ‘ect. it requires thinking
instead of memoi Ling. But itiwill be help-
ing college students enormously, if a pre-
mium is put on thinking instead of on
memorizing.

With this we pass the buck to the faculty.

THE AESTHETIC CONSCIOUSNESS

{Editor's note: President J. H. T. Main
worked for years to develop l’r‘ inltcll as all
art center. Cl‘catiw work to Iiim was more
Valuable tllrm more appreciation 07' copying
of misting painting, sculpture, music, 07
literature. Al lhc present time the art dc~
pal-tawnt, which came into being as (1/ 7‘0-
sult of his cllcr y, is exhibiting some of its
work. It is appropriate tllci'cfm'c, to print
excerpts from a report madc by President
Main in 1913.)

Mathew Arnold defined culturc as knowing
the best that has been said and thought in
the world. The_world has made some real
progress since Mathew Arnold’s time. We
recognize more clearly than ever before that
true culture is quite as much an attitude of
the heart and will as of the intellect, so that
a man might know all that he could wish
and remain uncultured if, as not infrequent»
1y happens, his inner spirit were not touched
into life by the sense of obligation and sym—
pathy and beauty.

Onc’s education, if it is to be more than
mere training, must fit him to be at home
in the world. He should have some love
and appreciation for the world . . . It is
more than a house; it is more than a work-
shop. It is, for a time, at least, man‘s
home . . . .

The college. an institution that stands for
a real understanding of the best things that
a mall ought to know, surely dares not per-
mit a student to go through the four years
of his course without making an attempt to
awaken iii him the consciousness that this
world is beautiful and is filled with beauti-
ful things This is essential to his enjoyment
of this world i . i and to the filll enjoy-
ment of life, surrounded as it is by the
gifts of nature and the gifts of men . i .

The fact that America today has so little
creative art is a manifest condemnation of
the age as a material age. The attempt to
systematics: knowledge ill the realm of hu-
man experience is stilltifying and mislead-
ing in its conclusions, unless in some way the
student imaginatively re-lives the experience
in its concrete totality. Literature and art,
then, are an absolute essential in all its
humanistic studies, and a positive attempt
should be made by this college to give its
students the opportunity to understand
something of the vital human experience
antd struggle of the world as revealed in its

QUOTABLE QUOTES
(By Associated Collegiate I’m)

“In the process of Americanizing our
education we have really, without knowing
it, drifted away from our older American
tradition. Nationalism, even if it is Ameri-
canism, is not liberalism. It very easily be-
colnes the opposite." Dean Christian Gauss
of Princeton university deplores the decline
of the study of the humanities.

OPEN FORUM

To the Editor:

To w. c. H, The interpretation
of major news events, said puts
pose stated in the introduction ot

,the new column this semester,

occasions these replies. This last
half semester the columns have
fairly consistently presented an
interpretation closely akin to the
editorial policies of the most re-
actionary papers in the country.
With a "waremongel‘ing" Roos-
evelt compared to a “man of (less
tiny” Hitler, the line of thought
begins. News commentator w,
c. H. defends the dictators de-
mands ably quoting the arivice of
both Hitler and Mussolini; name-
ly, that the democracies should
mind their own business, and de-
liherately confuses the issue.

The contention that the world of
1917 is the same world ala1939 is
a hit hard to swallow. Fascism to-
dey threatens world conflict and
inevitable retrogression. The dem-
ocracies, or, those countries who
still advocate lawful, orderly con—
duct of international affairs, can
bring the “rulers of force" to
terms. To check the desperate
expansionists is to make them
face the economic and social
problems which press for atten-
tion in their own countries.

strange that the war-mohgers
of 1917 today advocate isolation»
ism; that they condemn organized
resistance to organized attack?
Not strange at all for this is a
defeatist policy which can only
result in world holocaust, confu-
sion and anarchy.

War can he averted. it can
he averted when the peoples of
democratic countries acting
through their governments coop-
erate to insure world peace and
security. It can be averted when
those representative governments
refuse to provide materials for
warsmaohines to the aggressors.
it can and must be averted if
the democratic culture is to sur—
vive.
