highly controversial public question is in
obtaining the views of kliown opponents,ol
men with pronounced and different ideas
on the palticulal' question bel'ore them.
Then, instead of stopping at the mere state-
lnent ol' the opposing vieus (and leaving
the reader or tile audience to wallow around
in a maze of contradictions), the oppone
ents seek to lid an “area of agreement.”

They obviously do not agree on every7
thing, but they do agree on many things.
This “area of agreement” technique will my
parently not satisfy the pedagogical desire
for absolute truth, nor should any stutlent
feel that his own thinking and mental strugs

us something on uhich to act.

Democracy does not need to be made up
of citizens who do not know how to act,
when to act or why to act. This technique
wllen used widely enough can help to milli-
mize dissensions instead of maximizing
them. It can show us where ill we have
common ground, common ideas, common
purposes, and it can make our democracy
work, because the average citizen, instead

ﬁcoTii, “THE AREA or
AGREEMENT"

Anyone, amateur or professional, who has
tried to follow the discussions alid dissen-
tions concerned with broad matters of pub—
lic interest, must often have felt various
mental agonies and distresses as he has
tried to resolve and reconcile conflicting
claims, abuses, statements and charges in
his search for the essential truths and
facts.

Public affairs are so controversial, affect
us all definitely and directly, and their
complexity adds so lnueh to the difficulty
of grasping their essential facts, that most
of us will welcome a new technique for
presenting themi We know that a one
sided presentation of such matters usually
will not give us the truth. We also know
that a two, three, four or many sided pre-
sentation may only make it still more dif-
ficult for us to choose and to evaluate,
especially when our own knowledge is limit—
ed and the arguing skill of the differing
proponents seems unlimited.

Often times, antler such circumstances,
we go thru controversies feeling that we
could easily believe in any or all of the con-
flicting claims.‘ We end up by crying,
”What’s the use?"

To ollr rescue has come a journalistic
and educational device called the ”Area of
Agreement.” Fortune magazine for March
uses this technique in an article on ”The
Effects of Government Spending upon Priv
vate Enterprise," For a few years now the
Twentieth Century Fund, Inc. iii: used this
method in its studies of taxes, national
debt, social security, stock market control,
labor and government, and big business.

The essential feature of the “area of

Grinnell college, Iowa has two blizzards
early in March and the basketball team
loses the last game of the season to Drake.

But even on the front page of the news-
papers it is sometimes possible to find
lighter readingi Today, for instance, at Hunt,
er college a grave professorial gentleman is
advising young people to fall in love intellie
gently, uninfluenced by such ir elevancies as
spring and moonlight.

We like to think of the young ladies from
Hunter walking with the young men from
City college, ignoring the warm spring aft»
ernoons and talkng about the decreasing
birthrate and its effect on higher education.
It is an idyllic picturei

Also heartening is the story fronl Cleve,

ca ried out a threat to sit on a girder of a

sibly bridge-girder sitting willbecome popli-
lar, like flagrpole sitting of several years
ago. Majors in medieval history will recall
Sti Simeon who spent the last years of his
life sitting contentedly on top of a pillar
Maybe the Cleveland youth will find his
girder so attractive that no offer of a job
can lure him down.

When we tire of thinking about the New
York g 'ls falling in love intelligently, we
shall think instead of all the Cleveland elli-
ployers clustered anxiously on the bridge
calling coaxingly to the young man seated
high above them and looking tolel-antly

THE SWORD IN THE
STONE
By T. H. White.
The host ncw book i can rccoiir
mend to convalescent flu victims
is T. H White’s “The Sword in
the stone." It is a delightful story
of the childhood of King Arthur,
Imagine Mark Twain's “Corl-
nectleut Yankee in King Arthur's
,Court," the adventures of Robin
Hood, o picture of English life in
the thirteenth century, and the
treatises of an expert on falconry
all put together in the whimsical

rolrs “Alice in Wonderland.”

It is entertaining and strangely
believable, in spite of the ana»
ci-onisius and outlandish cxpcrr
el‘lCeS. After you. have once step-
ped through the looking-glass, so
to speak, you meet all sorts of
likeablc people with whom you
can have a lot of fun.

First, there is little Arthur who
is tremendously interested in ev-
erylhlng, and Kay, his foster»
brother, who likes to appear proud
and haughty. sn- Ector, his fos-
terrfather, who is bothered by
high blood pressure and utters
“pass the port" with every other
hreath, thinks boys shouldn't al-
ways “run around like hooligans"
but need some sort of "eddica-
tion," and considers advertising
for a tutor.

or course, Merlin, with his owl
Archimedes on his shoulder, tums
up at the right time, and after
insisting that he works only
white magic, is given the job. He
is terribly absent-minded, and is
continually confused by rememr
bering things in the future, which
are not yet invented (for he is
living backwards in time), but he
shows Arthur a very good time
by turning him into all sorts of
creaturesiowl; fish, snake, badgr
er, and liiwk, to name a few.
Arthur and Kay have a great
adventure with Robin Hood in
rescuing some friends from the
clutches of Morgan 1e Fay, who,
in beach pajamas and dark glass-
es, keeps an “Ye Olde Tea Shop-
pa” in her griffin-guarded castle,
over whose gate a huge neon sign
reads “The Queen of Air and
Darkness Now Showing."

in a lovely cottage in the woods
is Madame Mim, a worker of
black magic, who has a sign
over her door reading, “No in—
come tax collectors” And then
