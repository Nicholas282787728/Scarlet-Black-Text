ﬁlls A GOOD RIDE!

April 6, 1938 an introductory editorial to
the present 193839 administration said,
“We’ve hitched our wagon to a star, and
from here it looks like a good lide."

Now, 58 issues later, we can look back
and see if it was a good ride; moreover. we
can decide whether we ever reached that
star!

As for the rideiyes, it was quite a good
one. At the beginning of our year, we start-
ed our regime with high aspirations and
higher ideals. We may have been the fools
who “rush in where angels fear to tread,"
but we did so with a youthful confidence,
fired by the ambitiin to do what we thought
best for the good of the college.

Whether we succeeded depends upon the
opinion of Scarlet and Block readers. We do
believe, however, that we have made a sin
care effort not only to build up the respect
and importance of this newspaper but to
work for the best interests of Grinnell col-
lege as a whole. We have attempted to fol—
low a definite editorial policy; we have tried
to improve the general appearance of the
newspaper; we have tried to present more
news pictures; and we have made a sincere
effort to build up reader interest.

However, we realize that in spite of these
efforts we have made mistakes. We have
offended some by omitting news stories at
times; we have made some errors ill news
presentation; we have at times slipped up in
our circulation service. Nevertheless, re-
gardless of these mistakes, we have attempt»
ed to maintain the high reputation of the
Scarlet and Black.

By omitting news. however, it has never
been our idea to suppress. Rather, it would
be our desire to present all the news each
issue if space conditions would only allow;
but limited space is caused only by limited
funds. Errors in news presentation, circu-
lation and advertising may also be expected
because of the small size of the editorial and
business staffs. Although we have tried for
perfection, we have found that the long,
tedious hours put in twice each week by so
few staff officials have made it almost im—
possible to reach perfection.

Most of all, however, we wish to thank
our assistants at this time; without their de<
pendability and resourcefulness we would
no doubt have resigned long ago. We trust
that our successors will have as much staff
harmony as has been experienced this past
year.

In addition, may we express our grati»
tude to the staff of the Grinncll Herald-
Register, our printers. We‘ll always remem-
ber Bill, Louie, “Blue,” Carl, Wade, Lloyd,
Lenore, Don, Jim and ”Dutch." Without

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

these persons, our life on the paper might
have been dull indeed.

We also extend our appreciation to those
outside of the newspaper who have cooper-
ated with us so well. We strongly desire
that our successors will continue to receive
such cooperation from the college adminis
tration, faculty alld student organizations.

So now, ill this, oul final edition, we can
say proudly that our ride was quite a suc-
cessful one; but although we may not have
completely reached our star, we have a -
preached it almost within throwing di -
tancei We leave the final journey to our
successors. We hope they will reach the
star that we now see glittering in the dis—
tance~the star of a Greater Grinnelll

HAIL AND FAREWELL!

Probably the easiest thing which could be
done in this, our last editorial, would be to
glance fondly backward and gloss over what
we consider our achievements for the year;
but since there has been too much glancing
backward, with a brief resume we continue
to look only forward toward a Greater Grin-
nell.

During the past year the Scarlet and
Black has touched upon many phases of
campus life, trying at the same time to give
its readers an interesting as well as in-
formative inberpretation of the outstanding
current events off the campus. In dealing
with campus affairs in these columns, it has
been no little problem to coordinate our duty
to reflect student opinion here with our dc-
sire to initiate policies of our own ill regard
to campus problems.

THE COLLEGE BAND.

There are several things necessary to the
life of a college spirit on any campus. We
believe that a good band is absolutely a nec»
cssity. Under the capable leadership of our
director, Robert Vagner, the band has come
back this year stronger than ever. But it is
not yet the organization that Gl'mncll should
have. Next fall when the first practice is
announced, students must give the band
their unqualified support. It must be
brought up to a standard where there will
be keen competition for the privilege of
playing in the band. 1'
01m TOWN ASSOCIATES.

The Scarlet and Black may have been
wrong ill supporting the town men’s desire
for open house at the White House, but the
fact remains that there still exists the
problem of bringing town men into closer
union with the dormitories. Respollsibilty
for the satisfactory solution of this problem
rests squarely with the men’s halls.

LIVING CONDITIONS.

The truth sometimes hurts but the bald
fact is that quiet hours must be enforced
more impaltially and more effectively both
ill the dormitories alld ill the quadrangle.
There is absolutely no reason why this
should not be the rule rather than the ex,
ceptioni The responsibility for this is en-
tirely with the house officers; in their will—
ingness to maintain strict rules and in their
willingness to work hard to get the cooper-
ation of the men ill their hall.

CHAPEL.

Chapel will continue to be a pressing
problem, but our experience this sp ing has
been that if a large group of really interest
ed students are willing to tackle the prob-
lem, chapel can come to mean more and can
assume its rightful place in the Grinnell
atmosphere once again. Unceasing effort
should be the order of every day until this

is accomplished.
con ALMA MATER.

It will be with anxious eyes that we watch
the future of Grinncll from Alumni Point.
We are more firmly convinced than ever
that Grinncll College must stop bucking
away from the past. It must tum around
and walls toward the future. I l is but a dc—
feulist attitude-t0 talk of “Gi'inncll's Golden
Age“ as being somewhere in the past. “Grin—
ncll‘s Golden Age" lies somewhere in the
future and every Grinncllian, be he student,
faculty member, administrator or alumus
must believe this and spend every effort
toward finding that goal!

It strikes us very funny how the

OPEN FORUM

To the Editor of the
SCARLET AND BLACK:
Dear Mr. Rowley:

it has been sold on good auth-
ority tnet Grinnell girls are among,
the best in the ranks of Western
coeds. Certainly it is somewhat
indicative that transfers from
Grinnell usually makes one of the
large national sororities if they
change to a large university.|
Beauty and brains are not incom-‘
petiole, yet it doesn't seem to me
that the most is being made of
these edvauteges.

No matter whether you plan
to preside over a court, or a tea

table, the poise and true sophlsr
tication gained by activity in
some of the so~called high brow
activities are indispensable. How
many Grinnel‘l girls could lead an
informal round table discussion
of almost 70 people?

Miss Janet Miller of Wasnburn
college, Topeka, Kansas, was thc
chairman of a round table discus-
sion group at the International
Relations conference held in Oma—
ha last week. As attractive as
any Grinnell glamour girl, she
held the group to the subject.
quickly summed up the points of
different arguments, and led the
discussion in such e way that
all felt at ease to express any
thoughts they had.

Ask the delegates from the
dorms their opinions of the con-
ference girls.

I wonder how many girls at
Grim-loll could have duplicated
Janet Miller's work. Don't We
have ﬁle facilities with wblcn to
learn, or don't we take advantage
of them? We have bed e nelf-
hearted movament afoot for a
debate teem; we have the finest
backing for one of the best In-
ternational Relations clubs in the
Midwast, If we had more active
participation in such activit s
and perhaps some leadership from
the faculty the result ought to be
well worthwhile to the girls and
school as well.

—Kny Stone.

Comment:

Our greatest women have not all
been glamorous socicntes, but
they have been well versed and
have therefore possessed charm
and a desired social standing.
Many of them gained such e so—
cial position by taking advantage
of even the smallest of facilities
in which to learn. Grinncll we»
men. it seems, lack a good deal
in initiative for activity partipir
petion. Many have lost sight of
the will to learn; they have only

the will to impress.
