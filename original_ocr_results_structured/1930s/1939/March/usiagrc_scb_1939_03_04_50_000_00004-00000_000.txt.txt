Jitterbugs Try
Swing Sessions

On Key Chains

It wasn't so long ago that the
“Jitterbug" craze hit the colleges
and universities throughout the
country. Although the fdfl met
with little favor on the Grinnell
campus, another group of swing-
sters appears to havc descended
upon us en niasse.

You have seen them m the
corridors of the Alumni Recita-
tion hall and watched them ,
the dorms Wherever tlierc is a
group of people, you can count
on finding one follow that in-
sists on “swinging it."

He is the “klbitzer” that loans
over your shoulder and remarks
that you didn't play the card
right, until you feel like doing
a bit of swinging your-self.

He is the gentleman who
swings it as he trots meirily
along with that “I'm a thor-
oughhred on the hoof" air, stop-
ping only when the lnst coed is
out of sight.

He is the fellow who bought
a key chain to display his col-
lege pin and to carry his keys,
but who found it more fascinat-
ing to “swing it" instead

To the bewildered oniooher
who is dazzled by this display
of “swingeroo,” it appears as
another development in the "jit-
tel‘bug.”

Sophomore Class
Will Elect New

Slale Thursday

The sophomore class uill hold Sec—
ond semester election of officers
Thursday at 7:30 pm. in the Lite
tle Theatre of the quadrangle,
Fred Pauls, class president, an—
nounced today.

The junior class agreed last
fall to have one set of officers for
the whole academic year, Harry
Kies, junior class president, said
this plan was adopted in order
to insure closer coordination be»
tween the junior officers and the
Cyclone staff.

The senior class has set no de-
finite date due to the fact that
Lester Shepard, president of the
seniors, has left school.
