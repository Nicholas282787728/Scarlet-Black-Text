And have some time to waite

Like sometime when you're early,

Or the other fellow’s late:

Or when the Wind's too cold for

Or when the sun's too hot:

0r sometime when you're turbu-

0r sometime when you’re not;

Or when it's railiin‘ cats ‘n dogs
along the street—

Just come in and spend the time

A—lookin’ at the cards.
