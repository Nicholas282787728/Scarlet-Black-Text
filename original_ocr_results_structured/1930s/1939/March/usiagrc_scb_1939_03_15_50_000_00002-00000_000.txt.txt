EYOU SATISFIED?

Nicholas Murray Butler, president of Co-
lumbia university, has said, “A good doubt
is sometimes worth a college education!"

Now whether you agree with all of Mr.
Butler’s ideas or not, it is hard to escape
the significance of that statement. It is not
going too far to say that in some cases that
statement would be literally tru ' that if
there could be a possibility of getting solne
of the college students of our generation to
adopt much more of a questioning attitude
toward what they learn ill the classroom,
what they observe happening around them
every day and what they read and hear in
the newspapers and over the radio; in short
to think for themselves, such a questioning
attitude would be worth far more to them
than the money they are spending to come
to Grinnell college.

It all comes so naturally that very few of
us realize that practically all the informa-
tion we get about events and happenings
outside our own limited view is only that
which an intermediary person or organiza»
tioll chooses to give us.

The newspapers, the radio and the few
periodicals we read are the only sources of
information for most of us, and the great
majority read these with little degree of in-
telligence. So conflicting are reports of cu '-
rent events that one’s faith ill the integrity
of the press is sorely tried. For a few dol—

lars, compared to the interest involved, a

man, championing a cause, may color hisl
facts till his material is just short of libel
and then go on to convince millions of Amer-
ican radio listeners that his word is gospel
truth. We are bombarded on all sides with
articles in hundreds of periodicals that ad-
vocate everything man ever dreamed of,

So great a stake have those who control
our sources of information in the happen-
ings of the world that matters that it is
mere foolishness and folly to kid ourselves,
into believing that we are getting the
straight unbiased, truth and light of any
particular situation, It has been said that
prior to the Munich crisis last fall, the Enge
lish people as a whole were frightened, very
frightened at the thought of war, and furth»
ei'lnol‘e that Chamberlain brought about this
condition to further his own policy. Whether
that be true or not will not be known for
some time, but this is certain, that such it
thing is possible in a, modern world.

There may be a possibility that in time
people as a whole will reach a saturation
point ill the matter of propaganda, which
would mean ill a sense that propaganda
would defeat‘ itself, but that time is not
here now. If an encouragement, an admoni—
tion and a warning, such as is brought out
ill Mr. Butler’s statement, was ever needed,
it is at the present time.

One of the principal things to be gotten
from a college education should be the art
of thinking for one’s self and of raising a
good, healthy doubt to something once ill a
while. If a student could get no more than
this out of college he will have gotten
enough.

is;
YOU NEVER CAN TELL

Tomorrow night ili Des Moines will appear
on the stage a mar ed couple, who are in-
cidentally two of America’s finest players.
Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontannc can act
successfully almost any role, and the play
in which they will appear ill Des Moines is
based on one of the oldest of Greek stories.

It tells the tale of Zeus, the father of the
gods. who‘had a weakness for mortal ladies.
Most of them he won fairly easily, but one
was so stubborn that he had to woo her in
the shape of her own husband. What hap—
pened when he did is as funny in Amph'ir
tryoli 38 as it was in any of the 37 preced-
ing plays on the same subject.

Not everyone will be able to go to Des
Moines to see the Lunts, but those who do
will get to watch a new version of one of
the oldest and funniest plays in the world.
In our pride for our modern achievements
in speed alld communication, we may pause
to ask ourselves whether we have produced
a play as durable as the story of Amp/LI}
tin/mi.

Three thousand years from this evening,
6,000 miles from Iowa, will anyone he look-
ing forward to seeing the latest version of
the old American play, You Can't Take It
With You 88? Or will he decide to stay
home and study for his quiz in Ancient
American History 101, 177611948, the Bath-
tub Era'l You never can tell.
