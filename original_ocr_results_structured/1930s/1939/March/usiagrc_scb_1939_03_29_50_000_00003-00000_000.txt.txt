‘THE LONG VALLEY,

By John Steinbeck.

It is strange that so much liter-
ature of violence should have
come from California, the land of
sunshine. But from its beginning
with Bret Harte on down through
the era of Frank Norris to the
present reign of Robinson Jeffers
and John Steinbeck. California
writing has been brutal and tragic
and full of action.

it may be significant and
worthy of note that the Golden
State's real contributions to art
have come not from the balmy
atmosphere of Los Angeles but
from San Francisco's ruder clime.

Be that as it may, California's
most recent literary star. John
Steinbeck, carries on well the tra-
dition of his predecessors.
stories collected under die title,
“The Long Valley," are typical
Steinbeck—as starkly and blood-
ily realistic as Norris with his so-
cial consciousness but without his
melodrama; occasionally, like Jere
iers, concerned with abnormal
and perverse psychology and re-
vealing something of Jeffers' gift
of poetry.

Moreover, “The Long Valley"
shows a more versatile talent than
one might expect from the author
of “Of Mice and Men” and the
earlier volumes. The stories range
from "Saint Katy the Virgin," a
medieval saint legend told with
the sly irreverence of Anatole
Fr nee (Saint Katy was a farm-
er pig), to "The Vigilante,"
which proves that in spite of all
the recent versions of the theme,
it is possible to give a new turn
to the luriol account of a lynch-
ing.

The most ambitious story of the
group, really a novella, is “The
Red Pony," This story of Jody
and his horses is reminiscent of
the famous passage in Lincoln
Steffens, both because the two
narratives are about a boy and
his pony and because the settings
for the two—the inland country
near San Franciscoiare the same.

The fictional Jody is just as

real as the actual Lennie. and his
expeiuences are, if possible, more
poignant, as they are more vio-
lent. For Jody as for Lennie, thel
final outcome is a

lecticn. It's honest, simple, manly
writing, and a masterpiece in the
short story form.

Steinbeck is still a comparative-
"miserable, ly young writer. Perhaps one

|sliould speak of the promise
Perhaps the best story in thegrather than the fulfillment of his
volume, although a slighter work work. "The Long Valley" is well
than “The Red Pony," is ”The worth reading for its own sake,
Chrysanthemums," one of the se- and also for the chance it gives
lections in last year's O'Brien colrl one to share the zest of a grow~

lng artistic power.

As Willa Gather remarked of
one of her heroines, “success is
never so interesting as struggle,
not even to the successful." This
maxim applies, I believe, to the
reader as well as the writer, and
it is one oi the many reasons why
"The Long Valley" is an exciting ‘
book.

—Henry Aldai.
