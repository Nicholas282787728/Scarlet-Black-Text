W—ATCHING AND WAITING

Editor’s Nol . For purposes of clarity, ll
is necessary to read the news story on Page
One in order to comprehend more fully the
discussion brought out in the following
editorial. ‘

****

If the Scarlet and Black has misunderstood
the administration or has been misinformed
as to administrative policies, we wollld be
the first to admit such an error, Some opin-
ion has been going about that such was the
case. As the result of careful thought, and
as the result of the meeting of student lead-
ers with President John S. Nollen in his
office last Thursday night, we have come
to an honest conclusion: that while we may
have misunderstood the administration to a
certain extent, we have been only slightly
misinformed Where we were misinformed,
we acknowledged our error to the president
Thursday night.

However, the fact that the administration
may have been misunderstood is not new
here but has been one of the chief causes
of complaint all anngithis common misun-
derstanding being due to a lack of intimate
and cooperative relations between the ad—
ministration and the student body and the
administration and the faculty, and even in
some cases between the administration and
the alumni.

The group of student leaders and the
president Thursda night reached all agree‘
ment, which if ca through to a definite
realization will provide a solution to the
problem of such relationship.

We are grateful for the cooperative atti-
tude shown by the administration, and
While we realize that definite solutions to
the problems, as were submitted in written
form to the president at the meeting, can-
not be realized at once, we do, nevertheless,
expect that action be taken at once to make
an ultimate solution possible.

At the meeting the Scarlet and Block’s
report outlined and interpreted the difficul—
ties which had given rise to the editorial of
Jan. 7 in which the newspaper accused the
college of “slipping."

The report, having been discussed at
length for about two hours, brought out the
facts that on some minor technical points
the Scarlet and Bloch had not been ade—
quately posted, bllt that on the larger issues
there was ample, leyt‘tlmatc ground for dis»
cussion.

The meeting brought out two facts: that
the administration is willing to cooperate
with student leaders, and that there is
much work to be dime!

This newspaper should not and can not

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

expect ilnliicdiatc solution to Grilnlcll’s l’in-
ancial problem, which, although in compari-
son with other schools is a relatively easy
problem, inust not be allowed to stand in
the way of any improvement for a better
Grillllell.

We want very inllcll to see action as soon
as possible, and the Scarlet and Block does
not intend to sit idly by t your or any
other year if its sincel reconnnendations
are ignored. A new administration assumes
control of the newspaper April 1 of this
year, and the prospective new heads arc
just as determined. We can therefore only
take on fin attitude of watching and waiting.

We urge Robert Moclll, whom the presi-
dent appointed as chairman of the group,
acting as a student committee and advisory
body to the administration, to make use of
h opportunity of aiding Grilillell by make
lng his committee work] 11' he does not,
the problem of udministrative-studcnt relar
tions will not be Solved. We pledge our slip-
port and urge the other members of the
committee to join us in a vigorous, cooperae
tive campaign with the president for a
better Grinnell college.

While the student body must do its share,
it cannot do it all. We are going to look fol»
ward to better alumni relations with the
college, a better understanding between ad-
ministration, faculty fnld students, depart
mental improvements, and other points
which are brought out in the story of the
meeting on Page One of this issue.

By desi ing quick action we shall natural-
1y expect eventual results#results ill some
cases which may take one or two years, but
which will, nevertheless, ultimately come
about. We realize that to obtain results re—
quires time, but time is accepted providing
the work is started now.

This newspaper appreciates the coopera-
tive attitude taken by the administration to
further the cause of a better Grinnell. Be-
cause of this, we shall take pleasure ill obs
serving what is done to advance our pro-
gram. it was advanced in all sincerity; it
must be carried out in all sincerity.

But if it is found that the problem is be
ing received too lightly, we can do no more
than present another “reminder."

THE EDITORIAL BOARD

~—H

WALL AROUND FRANCE

Most Americans who are enough interested
in the Spanish war to take sides favor the
Loyalists; but it is the few sympathizcrs

with Franco who have found the news of .

the fall of Barcelona most pleasant. They
see, probably rightly, the defeat of the gov—
ernment alld an ultimate Victory for the
rebels. Do they see too the implications of
the rebel triumph?

The coming victory for Franco menus.
quite aside from its significance to Spain,
the country most concerned, a France SLlI'r
rounded by dictators Germany to the east;
Italy to the southeast; Spain to the southr
west, In all continental Europe, France is
the only country committed to dclnocracy#
the only country like ours. With France so
hemmed ill, democracy ill Europe is in a
bad way.

it is still not too late for Congress to lift
the arms embargo, which thus far has SuCr
ccodcd merely in aid llg the rebels. Desper—
atc though the position of the Loyalists is,
the war is not over. it may \VelI be that a
decision now by Congress to permit the
shipment of arms to Spain would have a
decisive influence on the result of the War.

Unless Government Spain gets aid soon,
the end of the war is ill sight; and with the
end France will be surrounded by hostile
nations.

We only postpone a, decision by not mak-
ing it now.

QUOTABLE QUOTES
(By Associated Collegiate Pvess)

“No matter what your grades are, you
still have a chance. Grades, after all, are
only an indication of what a student is
learning from his courses." A. J. Pul‘vis,
Adrian college, gives a condoling pat-on—the-
back to those who never stand at the head
of the class.

 

 

DQRIC

A COLUMN OF PURE
BEAUTY

By John Marion—
Craelt oi the week: Troubled stu»
denti‘uxll I know is what I read
in my crib'”

After our last issue we were
forced to listen to criticism be»
cause of the way Doric is being
written and what it contains. Be
fore that, we were criticised be-
cause it didn't contain anything.
We can't and don’t intend to
please everyone. but we do be
lievc that it is the straight goods
you want, and not a bunch of
silly baloney. If you want it, we
can give you a lot of tripe like
this: ._

Tillie Whnfnotz and Johnny
Knowitall are holding hands in
public again. Tsk, tsk, you two.
didn’t you know that this is a
Christian institution and such
things are frowned upon? But,
after all. when the weather is so

fine, now can we object to a lit-l

tie display of affection, even if it
is so flagrant as all that? so
our fondest blessings to you.

s a t
ii that's the kind of junk you
want, we‘ll give it to you, and
gladly. because it'll save the staff
of this paper from dodging all the
birds with blood in their eyes
who come looking for us after
each Wednesday issue. Neverthe-
less, we don't think that‘s ,what
you want.

Once more finals are over and
once more as usual the professors
had the honor and the students
had the system!

We hasten to condone the fast
action of the Council of House
Presidents who so promptly
solved Grinnelrs drinking pros
lem last week. This was especial-
1y ironic after the c. of H. P,

WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 1939

had the week before severely
reprimanded us for printing “the
fact” that there was drinking go»
ing' on around here. They has-
tened to inform us in a “lovely”
letter that there was NO drink-
ing at Grinnell.
Yes, it is true, Doris Johnson is
FREE again, but for the benefit
of you hopefuls who are contem—
plating calling, she is dated up
this week through Sunday and all
next weekend. Office hours are
from noon to o p. in. every day
(advertisement).

OPEN FORUM

To the Editor of the
SCARLET AND BLACK:
Dear Mr. Rowley:

Praises be to the Scarlet and
Black whose pungent comment in
‘the editorial section commands
the attention of all manner of
men and women.

Your recent editorial stand has
already several notable achieve;
'ments to its credit, not the least
of which is the awakening of
many alumni.

One of the most recent hap—
penings which should he attrib-
Iltcd to your excellent eritieism
occurred the afternoon of Friday,
Jan. 27, in the quadrangle loggia.

At that time nearly 154 feet
of new non-slippable rubber mat-
ting was laid. This was the first
of a series of such installments
which will be completed as soon
as a limited budget allows.

At least from now on the fe»
male contingent at Grinuell 'will
not be “slipping." May I again
congratulate you on your achieve-
ment?
