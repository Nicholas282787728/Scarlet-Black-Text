Coed Freshman Hazing Still Has Staunch
Supporters W itil Some Embarrassing Ideas

Freshman hazing, that
blessing anti diminishing campus
custom' of a few years ago, still
has its staunch supporters at
some of our women’s colleges and
coeducational universities

AL Sweet Briar, for example,
the greenest class is subjected to
a three weeks period of perse—
cution, At the end of this period
comes Freshman-Sophomore Day,
and at 6 a. m. freshmen must
appear wearing a dress back-
wards, placard with name on it
tied around the neck, hair braided
into pigtails and parted in the
middle, and green eyeshadow but
no other makeup. They carry
towels to kneel upon and wash
cloths to wipe the smiles off their
faces. All day long they are at the
mercy of the sophomore class,
Thcy must learn every sailor’s
name and salaam each time one
appears. Typical orders are to
scrub a ﬂight of stairs with a
toothbrush, inakc hcds, carry
hooks, rccitc spontaneously and

Duke has ”Goon Day.”

“Goon Day" at Duke foimd
freshmen in bathing- caps with
their cars protruding, abovcsthe-
knee, tight skirts, black knee
length stockings and white high-
hceled shoes. Then, to complete
the picture, all noses had to be
vividly rougcd.

At Skidmore, FreshmansSopho-
more Day brings out the Hitler
in every sophomore, and freshmen
have 21 “musts” to remember all
day. Typical ones are, “Freshmen
must wear ten pigtails tied either
with string or ribbon . . . must
know reasonable number of jokes,
and good jokes . . . must carry
matches for sophomores to bor-
row . . , i must have a good
clash costume. If a sophomore
does not think the clash is vivid
enough, she may request the
freshman to go back to her dorm
and change into something more
striking.

One unfortunate tinder-graduate
last year was forced to crawl on
her hands and knees in the dining
room, deliver endless speeches on
a variety of subjects, propose to
one of her teachers and eat with
her mittens on and her chair
turned backwards to the table.

The class of '40 at Connecticut
College for Women would like to
drop the whole business of initiae
tion and give the freshmen a
whopping big party instead, One
dignified senior remembers only
too well the day she had to wear

Prepping Days

with one last stoop, the 105 or
so freshman girls left behind
their nagging duties, took off
their marks of insrgnificance, the
yellow bow, and joined the indis»
ci-iminatcd ranks of the Griiinell
cased.

With ten pigtails tied
different colored ribbons, with
shoes and socks that didn’t
match, with snowball or horsehide
mittens on their hands, the be—
iughted freshmen struggled
through dinner under the watch-
ful eyes of the upperclassmen.

Final excrutiation came when
all the berihboned girls passed
into Main corridor between the
League Board and the upperclass
girls who cheered ,trom every
point of vantage but the chan-
deliers, Their tinal glory came
after Proxy Hill welcomed them
all into the commonwealth ot the
quadrangle, and when Grace Sev-
c‘lk, vice president of their class,
tossed the freshman ribbon in of-
figy on the fire.
