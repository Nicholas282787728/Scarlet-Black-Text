THE CRIBBING PROBLEM

The problem of how to deal with the stu-
dellt who cheats ill his examinations is a
very, very old one. Some new and interest-
ing light was recently thrown on this sub»
ject by a campus poll, the results of which
should be important to every student, since
the problem, indirectly at least, concerns us
all. In this poll, a great majority of Grin-
nellians went on record as preferring the
honor system to the proctoring system. We
must define these terms in order to make
tibiae results of the poll mean anythillg definv
1 .

The college which' depends on the in-
structors to punish cribbing is using the
proctoring system. On the other hand, the
college which allows the students to deal
with cribbing and the cl‘ibbel‘s is under
some kind of an honor system, These defin—
itions should have been part of the poll.
Unfortunately, they were not.

The honor system depends upon a comr
mittee of students to punish offenders The
weaknesses of this plan are: firstly, the
honest students hate to “tattle" on the
cheaters; secondly, with a student commit—
tee doing the punishing, it is hard to keep
the procedure strictly impersonal; and
thirdly, the committee must have constant
support from the student body at large.
This last requirement is almost impossible

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

to satisfy, since it is so hard to keep a large
body of people stirred up over a question
for any length of time.

The proctoring system probably failed to
get the support of the students because they
fear that student proctors might be used, or
because they remember that in the past a
few professo have failed completely to co-
operate ili doing anything at all about crib-
bing. If these two objections could be over-
come, the results of the poll would have
been far different. The proctoring System is
by far the simplest and most effective way
to deal with the problem.

Before any definibe action is taken on
this question, we hope that all concerned
will take time out to give it their very seri»
ous consideration. If a change is to be made,
the bad features of the student honor system
should at least be seriously weighed with
the good. Let’s think twice before we try a
radical experiment in this important matter.

IS lHE LABOR ACT FAIR?

Since 1935 the National Labor Relations
Board has administered the Wagner Labor
Act. In that time it has had one Supreme
Court decision against and twelve for it. In
that time'ovel' twenty thousand cases have
come before it. More than ‘30 per cent of
these cases have not received public atten—
tion. Fewer than 10 per cent have caused
a great deal of bickering. Our Newton
strike of last summer is a case ill point.
Amendments have been suggested to the
act on several grounds, (1) that it is once

Sided in favor of labor, (2) that the Board,

has interpreted the law to the advantage of
the 0.1.0. and against the A.F.L., and (3)
that it is not preventive but only curative.

To the first suggestion it can be replied
that the act is supposed to be one-sided in
order to correct all original unbalance.
Capital has been protected by all sorts of
laws, but only until recently has labor been
guaranteed certain “unalienable rights.”
This act changes the former status in order
to put labor on an equality with capital,

To the second suggestion it can be shown
that decisions ill favor of the A.F.L. have
been practically as numerous as in favor of
the 0.1.0. Whatever bias the Board has had
does not show itself in deciding cases in
favor or against one rival union as oppos»
cd to another. They have been treated
equally. J“,

In regard to the third proposed amend-
ment it can be admitted that the Board‘s
powers should be increased to include more
mediative technique. Thus the Board could
start functioning before a dispute actually
broke out, and violence could be reduced.

Perhaps it might also be wise to distri-
bute the administrative and quasi-judicial
functions of the Board ill such a way that
these separate functions would be handled
by different sub-agencies instead of by the
same individuals, ‘

All ill all it is going to be difficult for the
opponents of the act to point to any fla-
grant abuses or unjust use of power. A
great quantity of propaganda is being put
ollt to stir up the public, but a fair and
judicious review of the record fails to indi-
cate any perversions or injustices.

 

OPEN FORUM

To the Editor of the

SCARLET AND BLACK:

Dear Mr. Adams:

This country’s big race tracks
manage to get a lot of publicity
for their races—the publicity giv-l
en the Kentucky Derby last Sub
nrclay. for example. It seems to
me that we of Grinnell have So
far “missed the boat." We have
a race every single day of the
school year, rain or shine. The
starting bell rings in the Dorms
each noon at 12:30, and they're
off. Two hundred fellows rush inr
to the dining room and sit. down
hastily.

After about Len minutes of
grabbing and gulping. the lucky
winner manages to leave the room
ahead of the pack, We have no
"photo finish" yet, but the prizes
(ruined digestions) will be dis-
tributed fairly when the time
comes. Nature can't be cheated.

We live in an age of Speed, but.
there are limits to it. It is im~
possible for a civilized person to
eat lunch in less than tWEnty min»
utes. No doubt this time can he
cut some day, when perhaps we
will all gel. uur nourishment by_
eating concentrated food capsules,'
or when man evolves a gizzard.
which seems likely to happen very
soon if college students are fair
representatives of the coming gen—
eration. But as things now stand,
it really seems too bad that we
can’t spare just twenty minutes
(the third part of an hour and
the seventyesecond part of a day)
to eat our noon meal.

This suggestion will no doubt
be frowned upon by those waiters
who seem to take pleasure in
snatching food off the table be<
fore some of the fellows have
even a chance to look at it twice,
but then, every proposal is bound
to stir up some opposition.

So with a proper regard for a
constructive program, may 1 hum-
bly suggest that no wniter be al»
lowed to start to clear his table'
at noon until ten minutes to one,
as long as we eat at twelve<
thirty? Who will begrudge the
follows 20 unmolested minutes in
which to eat lunch?
