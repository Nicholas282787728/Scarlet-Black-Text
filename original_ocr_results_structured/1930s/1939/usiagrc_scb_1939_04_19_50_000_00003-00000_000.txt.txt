‘Hell-Raisers’ Al-e

Fined by Council
Working in conjunction with the

Council or House Presidents the
Student Council levied fines this

week on the participants in the,

fillingrln of the college bookstore
and the stacking of the Alumni
Recitation hall,

Several weeks before sprrng va-
cation the college bookstore steps
were filled-in with show two
nights marrow and the Thursday
before spring vacation the furni.
ture in the ARH was moved to
the first floor.

Fines were levied to cover dam—

ages done to the furniture in the,

ARH and to cover the cost of
labor in digging out the book-
store steps.

According to Robert Moehl.
president of the Student Council,
the administration of Grinnell
college made the stand that unless
the student governing groups took

some action to penalize the meni
the ,

responsible for the pranks,
administra‘tion would take dis-
ciplinary action. The student
Council and the house presidents
voted to investigate and take ac»
tion on the misdemeanors in or-
der to settle the affair with the
least publicity, Moehl commented.

BEHIND THE BALLOTS

Bl! James A. Farley.

With the American institute of
Public Opinion revealing that
James A. Farlcy is among the
five “best possibilities" for norn-
ination in the coming Democratic
convention, we have a particular
reason for wanting to know what
Farley feels about the matter. In
“Behind the Ballots" one won't
find too much confession upon
the part of “Shilling Jim" Farley,
as regards his aspirations for
the presidential seat, All he
wants of the next president is a
“thoroughrgoing party member,"
Farley qualifies.

Above all else, Farley wants
friends. Certain paragraphs of the
hookathe reader is constantly re-
mindediseem to be excerpts from
Dale Carnegie: "How to Win
Friends and influence People.”
But his “influence” is specialized
in “Behind the Ballots.” 1t centers
around the field of politics, and
how one can become influential
there. To the political aspirant he
says, “Never try to get revenge
in politics and never lie to news»
paper men.” In another sentence
he explains, ”I am an oldefashion-
ed fellow who was brought up in
a small town and who still be-
lieves that the only way to get
ahead in public life is to under-
stand pcople and to sympathize
with their viewpoints."

From a statement of his basic
political philosophy, F a r l e y
branches out into a concrete ac<
count of his rise. He stresses par-
ticularly the first public job he
held, one with the New York
Boxing commission; the humor
and hard work that went hand

in hand in the task of “selling" a

 

future president to a nation both
in 1932 and in 1936; how he sends
out an average of 1,500,000 letters
a year, about 5,000 ii day; how he
can, in green ink, sign 2,000 let-
tcrs an hour, avoiding threatened
cramps by holding the hand for
a few minutes under cold water;
how he likes to spend his vaca-
tion from the long, laborious hours
of the political field by attending
Elks' conventions,
meet more people. He puts little
emphasis upon his personal feel-
ing for Mr, Roosevelt. merely
stating that he has never found
(or left) the president in a sullen
mood. Farley rushes on to inti-
mate that lie is more interested
in "having a progressive man as
chief executive than he is in who
the man actually is."

Mr. Farley certainly doesn’t
tell all‘he is still in politics. Yet
one can not help admiring him,
his unquestioned ability, and his
sincere sympathy for his fellow
beings.
