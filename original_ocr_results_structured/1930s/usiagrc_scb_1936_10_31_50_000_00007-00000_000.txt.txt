THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

PAGE SEVEN

 

Reporter Finds
Blondes Don’t
Predominate

Who was it made the crack that
all the women in school this year
are blondes? Anyway, they were
wrong. An elaborate survey, dur-
ing which the reporter got in
everybody's hair, almost literally,
shows that only 27.9 per cent of
the Grinnell cereds are on the per-
oxide side,

A few more than half, or 51.3
per cent, are bona fide brunettes,
3.3 per cent redheads (to be on the
safe side, let's say auburn), and
17.6 per cent hrownettes, the group
that's not quite 'one thing or the
other.

Gentlemen in search of blondes
would do well to call Haines cot-
tage, which leads the quad with
19 tow-heads, Second floor in that
cottage is the best bet, nine of
its members having the kind of
hair that shows up best on a dark
suit collar,

Read comes next in the number
of blondes, with 18. Seven of
them live on second floor Read,
but Mears' second floor has eight.
What is it about second floor that
attracts the goldilocks? Pine Tree
Place foota the list, with only three
blondes in residence.

There are only 10 genuine rede
heads in the quad, the reporter
found, though she can think of at
least two more who live in town,
Cleveland cottage has cornered the
market with four of the group
living there.

This survey lays no claim to
accuracy. Just try to gel: any
three women to agree on the pre—
cise classification of another one‘s
hair!

Over Six Foot Marla

You have to look up to the men
in the freshman class this year!
According to records in the dean
of men‘s office, more than half of
the preps are six feet tall, or
more.

If you-re interested in statistics,
57 of the 103 freshman men are
among the giants, making 55. 3 per
cent. Among the npperclassmen,
39 sophomres, so juniors, and 10
seniors have their heads in the
clouds. ’

The odds may all be in favor of
Drake this afternoon, but there's
something about a Homecoming
that gives any football team that
extra ginger that often wins. This
Homecoming is no exception, and
the way the spi t and the tension
have been building up this week,
it looks as though the team will go
on the field in a better frame of
mind than in any game this year.
The demonstration inst Tucs-
day night, when around 75 or
100 students got together for an
impromptu parade and pop
meeting is a fair sample of the
pitch to which the student body
is being keyed this week, and it
proves in our minds that the
spirit this year is better than
for some years past.

In case any of our alumni (or
the students, for that matter) are
worried that Grinnell team meme
bels aren't fighting as they used
to, they may be heartened by the
example set by Roy Jensen last
week. Jensen, captain, star, and
manager of the Pioneer crosse
country squad, was stricken with
appendicitis while running in a
mect‘against Iowa state Teachers
college Saturday. In spite of cone
siderable pain, Roy finished the
race and placed second behind
Blaikie of Grinnell. He was oper-

ated on at 11 o’clock that night.

Latest reports from the hospi-
tal indicate that Jensen is re—
covering in good shape, after
suffering a’had two days fol—
lowing the operation.

The original Maltese cross,
worn by a member of the track
team of 1392, has been added to
the collection of trophies in the
possession of the school. The
cross was designed at ’the same
time that the school colors of
scarlet and black wcre adopted.
and has identified Grinnell athletes

and athletics for a period of 44

years. For those interested, John

Truesdale, director of athletics, al-

so has in his possession the origi-

nal paper design of the Gothic

“G” now worn by letterwinnera
This design was made around
1394 to replace the “I. c." for
iowa college in use at the time.

by the Blucjays, who are as yet

Social Regulations

New York city, N. Y., (NsEAi
iBeliev'ing that the question of
social regulation in women's col-
leges has had neither sufficient
study nor consideration. the Nate
ional student Federation is un-
dertaking a survey of conditions
throughout the country, on the
basis of which it hopes to draw
up a comprehensive report.

The survey has been drawn up
by Miss Mary Jeanne McKay,
NSEA national committeewoman
at large, President of the student
Association. Florida slate college
for Women. She has attempted in
the survey to preserve a fine
balance between analyses of acne
demic, social, and living condi—
tions. The questions cover many
subjects from contidenual reports
on religion to specific questions
covering curfew, quiet hours, dat-
ing privileges, riding rules, dance
ing, smoking, meals, cuts, and
athletics.
