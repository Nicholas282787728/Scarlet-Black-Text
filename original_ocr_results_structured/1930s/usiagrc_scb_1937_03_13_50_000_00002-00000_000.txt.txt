Need for Social
Workers Keynlote
of Vocations ‘Class

That we will always have social
problems and consequently a need
for social workers was the key-
note of the discussion conducted
by Miss Grace Ferguson, profese
sor of sociology at the University
of Iowa, and otto S. Muntz, exeA
cutive secretary of the Greater
Iowa commission, at the vocations

been in a condition of economic
insecurity cannot. come out of it
merely by a return to prosperity,
for the individual has undergone
tremendous psychological and so-
cial changes.

“There has never been an ade
quate supply of well trained social
workers," the speaker pointed out
and went on to name the fields
of greatest opportunity in social
work as being family case work.
child welfare, social group work,
medicine, psychiatry, probation.
and parole.

Explains Commission

Mr. Muntz explained that the
Greater Iowa commission was an
organization of the civic and pro-
fessional leaders of the state for
the purpose of putting into action
plans to make Iowa a greater
state.

The fundamental resources of
the state which make this plan
possible as enumerated by Mr,
Muntz are the highly intelligent
people, land, and coal.

Two Industries

Under the plan as sketched by
the speaker Iowa would he divid»
ed into two sectionSALhe south-
ern part to have dair ng as its
principal industry; and the north
em to specialize in the growing
of sugar beets.

"Three hundred million men

would be required to carry on the
sugar beet project, alone,” Mr.

has i Muntz declared,

“and the chem-
istry of forming will be another
big field if the plan succeeds."
These chemists, according to
Mr. Muntz, would be occupied in
mining new uses for farm prod
ducts and in discovering more
-cientific farming methods.
