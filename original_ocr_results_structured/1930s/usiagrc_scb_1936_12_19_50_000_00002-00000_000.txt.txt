25 Prep Gridders
to Get Numerals
for Year’s Work

Twellty»llve freshmen have been
picked as numeral winners for the
1936 season, John c. Ti-uesdale,
freshman football coach, air
nounced today. “The numerals
were awarded on the basis of at-
tendance, spirit and participation,"
Mr. Truesdale said.

The numerals will be awarded
only to those men on the list whose
work the first semester indicates
that thcy will be eligible for var-
sity competition next fall, accord-
ing to Mr. Truesdale. Men who
do not live up to the academic re—
quirements this semester will be
given their numerals at the end of
the second semester if they have
acquired sufficient hours and
grade points to insure their eligi-
bility,

“None of the letter winners will
be eligible for intramural sports
until they have been definitely cut
from the varsity squad," Truesdale
stated. Numeral winners who do
not report for varsity practice
next fall will automatically be in-
eligible for intramural competi-
tion. '

The numeral winners are; Dun-
bar Bair, Cari Blank, Russel Berg,
John Crabbe, Robert Coggeshall,
Richard Hovey, Al Franz, Roy
