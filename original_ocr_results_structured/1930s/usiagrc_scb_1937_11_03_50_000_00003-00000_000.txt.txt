Drake again looms large in
conference circles as this year's
championship strongest contender
by virtue of its decisive victory
over Grinnell Frld’dy, but will
have a tough time proving her
claim to the title this weekend,
when Tulsa and the Bulldogs
,clash, Tulsa gave evidence of
unexpected power by defeating
the Oklahoma Aggies week before
last by a 2770 score, and the bout
between the two schools is ex—
pected definitely to decide the
championship.

Of course, St, Louis university
has yet to play its three con-
ference battles, but even should
they win all three, it will be diffi-
cult to convmee the winner of the
Drake-Tulsa game that St. Louis
should be given a chunk of the

glory.

By Wells Hi Barnett

We were having a little talk
with Coach Guy Lookabaugh yes-
terday afternoon anent the Carlee
ton game this weekend. After
we’d lined up a little dope, we
mentioned in a casual way that
we still didn’t think Drake was
that much better than Grinnell.

which started a very interest-
ing discussion. “You know,"
Lookabaugh said, “there is some»

 

thing very interesting to he found
in an analysis of that game.
Look at this: Drakc got three of
their touchdowns on hrcaks, One
was a blocked kick caught in the
air and run for a touchdown. An-
other was a runhack of a punt
for a score. The third was one
of those great long passes they
were throwing.

At the some time, (
one touchdown as the it
break, and was on »
scoring twice mot-eeoiiee righist
the first of the gam,. when mt:
got the hall on a. fumble, and
once at the beginning of the first

nell got

.hialf when the new backiield come

hinotion clicked and hronght the
ball to their 1‘ yard line.

Now, if Griunel
been Just a little
Drake’s had been \SL a
worse, that game uould
been far more interacting."

s s e

And he's right at that, for a
little calculation based on that
reasoning will give you a. score
running around 277217whlch
would have been (all? a thriller.

We. in company with the other
4,440 people at the game, were
quite impressed by the exhibition
given by the Drake baud—an exe
hihition which reflected no little
credit on the school, and which
served as a powerful advertising
message,

Just as the hand was perform-
ing, we talked to Ed Lytton,
Drake business manager, who
tipped us off on how Drake man
aged to create such an outfit. 1n
the first place, he said, they
have discouraged the idea that
band is a “sissy" pastime, and
have made it an honor to helong
to the hand. In order to do so,
they have made it worthwhile to
belong to the organization by gills
ing dinners every once in awhile.

Natu lly tknt hroiight the hoys
and girls out. And since the hand
has become so cvcellcnt, it is even
more an honor to be a part of
it. But Drake goes even farther.
They took the hand to Creighton,
and when the boys wanted to go
to Notrc Dame, they offered
them 55.00 apiece and told them
to try and get their own cars.
In 10 minutes they had 14 cars
lined up and away they went.

it would be pretty linrd to do:
that a band like that pays plenty
back on its investment and re»
fleets great credit on the school
As It service to our Haitiolh

staff-men has been organized to

day and wire back a report of
the game. so if your paper is a

fact that thc Carleton authori-
