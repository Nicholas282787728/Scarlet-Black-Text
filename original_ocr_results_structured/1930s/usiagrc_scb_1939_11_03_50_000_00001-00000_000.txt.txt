‘Prex’ Donates Two-Bits as Local ‘Corn-Fed Canaries’
Walla/9 State University in First Football Contest

 

Little realizing the confusion
they have caused, the jobs they
havc created, or the stadiums they
have built, 22 men, representing
the University of Iowa and Grinr
ncll college, played the firstgame
of intercollegiate football westcf
the Mississippi river on Nov. 16,
1889. fifty years ago.

Undoubtedly settingiip the cur-
“Don't pay if. you can get in
rent Grinnell football tradition of
free,” the initial game was played
in a vacant lot back of Blair
hall, and was won by the Pio-
neers, thereby setting up a tra-
dition which failed to materialize,
There was no victory day follow-
ing the win.

According the Grinnell
“News Letter,” one of the two
campus newspapers, the field was
roped off, and the team man-
ager passed a hat to assist in
defraying expenses Voluntary
contributions ran into two flge
iires, $10, which, heaven forbid,
may have gone into building the
present men's gymnasium.-

The first gridsters had time
forms not unlike those of the
present freshman squad. To quote
the "News Letter," “The Pioneer
team presented anything but an
appearance that was beautiful.
In fact, a more lieterogeueous
collection of old clothes than

they possessed never disgraced

to

an intercollegiate contest. Two
only bad regulation football
pants The others were sweaters,
gym jerseys, last summer's cute
ing shorts, bicycle pants, and a
pair of genuine blue jean over-
ails. The visiting eleven was
more fortunate, in the matter of
apparel at least. They were fai

ly radiant in iiiispottcd suits of
“white canvas."

It should be noted that the
sports writer of fifty years ago
was just as berserk as the
sports writer of today. The
“News Letter" termed the Pier
neer line as being “the Rock of

“I feel that we are going to be
ready with as good a ball club
as we have had this year, de-
clared Coach Guy Lookabaugh as
he commented on tomorrow aft-
ernoon’s homecoming game with
Belo'll. college.

Constant scrimmages this week
have helped mold a combination
of football players who are will-
ing and able to play football.
Last Monday Lookabsugh pulled
no punches in explaining the de-
feat handed to them by Cornell.
After last evenings practice,
however, Lookabaugh was pleased
with the squad’s play, condition,
and enthusiasm.

Several Sliifm Planned.

There will be several shifts in
the Pioneer lineup tomorrow. Ed—
ward “Ody" waiters, leading
scorer, will play at the fullback
position instead of left half.
Harry Barker, former fullback,
will do most of his punting and
passing chores from the right
halfback post. Max Shelton, for-
mer guard, will play left end.
The Beloit game will be Shelton’s
first attempt at an end position.
From all reports of the week's
scrimmagcs, Shelton should be
at home at his new spot. '

Because the Grinnell passing
attack of late hasn’t been up to
par, most of the Pioneers offen-
sive efforts will be running plays.
