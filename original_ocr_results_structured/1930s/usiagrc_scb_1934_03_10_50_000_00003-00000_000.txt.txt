SATURDAY MARCH 10, 1934

This week brings news of at least,
three happy homes that. have gone
on the rocks, some partially and
some completely. If the Burton—
Pute Conlll' ion is not on the
rocks, at least it is no longer a
a closed corporation. Furthermore,
it is rumored that there is a rift
within the Fritiiaiimvest lute and
Florelle Copi‘land left the Hatfield
fold last weekend .uith Pittman. it
looks like the perennial l'e-llligllr
ment for the spring season.

Furthermore the intramural dance
was a strain on several family ties
with Gander Anderson and Connie
Davis severing relations temporarily
only to reunite after the contest.

The dance itself was a grut snc~

0955 for everyone except naive
oliphant who was looking for a tan
dance and ran into an old fashion-
ed ballet The finale of the Cottage
Four hollet, was the high point of
the whole show with a tricky dance
featuring solo work by each and
every member of the cost, the only
uniortunate thing about it being
that Helene Blake lost three pounds
trying to keep in step with Georg-
la Cole and vice versa.

The constant repetition of the
“nasty word" by the Meals ensemble
in their song probably dampened a
good deal of the judges‘ srdor for
their performance but the girls were
in rare form and it's no exaggeration
to say that their act looked liked hell,
thus making it realistic to the ex»
treme. In fact one could almost smell
the brimstooe on some of those
cracks about th League Board but
we have a suspi on that a good deal
of the brimstone came from the audi-

ence.

sunti tells us that Mason is
knovm at the quad as Dickie—Wick-

that Miss Drew has been with the

Rmvson boy so much lately that
she hailed Santi as "Charlie" the
other day, That makes the score
one up at the end of the half.

Other Gates hall items include the
fact that one of the Evans boys is
now keeping steady company with
Kathryn Farrell and that Maurice
Birdsall, the old nut, has contributed
so cents in fines to a common fund.
There's a fine of 5 cents for each
profane word and the money is just
coming in handfuls according to
Whitmore.
