Poetry Magazine
Published Today

(Continued from page 1)
dents has been a thought congenital
with the society It has appeared: let
us examine it

“New Hampshire Letter" by W. K.
F‘lucclls of Dartmouth is the first and
most significant poem in the magn»
zinc, and one which has cnraptured
me ever since the first proots came
from the press. I am tempted to say
here is Whitman, without Whitman's
slight effeminancy, but that would
be unjust. Mr. Flaccus writes with a
tinencss of perception, a keenness of
sensation. and a masculinity which is
not comparable, It is his own.

May I emphasize this latter point,
masculinity? Poetry never has been
and never can be the companion of
dainty veils and balanced tea cups.
No drama exists in mere fragility. I
beg permission to quote only a few
lines to prove my point.

“My friend from Georgia has the

hot South in his voice,

The scowling, brown

Texan rides hard and long, and the

Maine boy down

From the North woods. bringing

his lore with him.

can urge tire out of flint ..... ”
Certainly this man “has a passion
for poetry in his throat", Everyone
of the 28 pages has this “passion".

 

Miss Eda Lou Walton, the editor,
has selected poems which are agree-
able to her definitions or poetry,
which she elucidated so adequately in
the Nation of Oct. 28, Quite rightly.
too, This is the editor’s privilege
Miss Walton leans to lyric versei
likewise “college Verse": Miss Wal-
ton favors clarity and the simpli -
cation of associations (the ammo
sis of Hart Crane)——likewise “College
Verse."

The result is a Classic conserva-
tism, but undergraduates are Strong»
ly conservative. Impressionists and
conservatists write equally good
verse. I am proud of the magazine,
I am sympathetic with those whose
time has been spent in conceiving
and editing a magazine of such ex»
ccllence in material and format,

More than that, I believe in “Col-
lege Verse” and the College Poetry
Society with a missionary zealous—
ness. Although they are both quite
young, I can see the immense po-
tentialities which are inherent in
them.
