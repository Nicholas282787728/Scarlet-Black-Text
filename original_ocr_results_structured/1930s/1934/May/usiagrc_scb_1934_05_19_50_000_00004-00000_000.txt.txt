Staging and lighting were as usual
highly competent. Only, in spite of
the storm and rain. that wonderful

'the window undimmed: You could
tell the rain was real water, but you
could also tell that the old wind-ma—
chine sounded like a grindstouc, and
often kept you from hearing what
'the characters were talking about

Few more difficult plays have been
undertaken in recent years. It is
greatly to the credit of the players
that at the end of an unusually active
year they have brought such a play
to so near a highly-perfected pe -
romance. The aristocracy of Spain s
very far removed from our life and
times. but these players are on the
way to making it appear convincing.
and by Commencement they will be
able to give a wonderfully fine per-
formance.

tive, according to the deci on of the

refuses to disclose whether she and
Pittman are keeping steady company
or not. The concensus of opinion
seems to be that they are, inasmuch
as Plttman‘s cells are as regular as
meat loaf.

Howard Whitney, who makes an
appearance every now and then with
the versatile actress and dramatist,

{Truly Trousdale, must find her some-

dramatic influence, no doubt.
