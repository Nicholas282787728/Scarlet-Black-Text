Author of ‘The Romantic Young Lady’

Follows Romantic School of Drama

in 1926 the translated version opened
at the Times Square Theater in Nciv
York It played there and at the Civ—
ic Repertory Theater for several sea-
sons, and was received with delight
by audiences usually cynical toward
anything romantic. The screen adap-
tation of "Cradle Song" has recently
bcen released, and a short time ago
was shown in Grinnell.

“The Romantic Young Lady,"
styled by the author as a “poetic
farce,” is a more recent play, and had
a successful run at the Neighborhood
Playhouse in New York. It has been

rector of drama.

Lover of Romance

Sierra is a Romantic, and makes no
apology for it: His idea of life he
neatly summarized in the final
speech of one of his earlier plays,
"The Lover":

"The poet was rightewe have
been born too late into a world which
has grown too old."

Upon casual consideration this
might seem to label Sierra as an es-
‘capist, afraid of life, But he is no
such thing. He realizes the futility of
looking for the ugly things in life and
firming over them, as the “brutal
realists" love to do. Instead, he sees
beauty. and writes about pleasant

State School
Qualifies 13
Men Friday

Rain TodayHindersRunners
Seeking New Records

in Final Heats

The University of Iowa won firsts
in seven of the 13 beats and placed
12 qualifiers in the preliminaries of
the state college track meet on
Ward field yesterday afternoon,
starting an attempt to regain the
state title won by Drake last year.
Iowa had held the championship for
nine consecutive seasons preceding
the Drake victory.

Grinnell was fourth in the number
of qualifiers, withrfour men eligible
to compete this afternoon in the
events for which preliminaries yere
held. Clark finished second in his
heat of the low hurdle race; Ander-
son was third in one heat of the sad;
Bentley was third in one heat of the
220, and Barnes finished third in his
heat of the quarter»mile.

Iowa State second

Iowa State college was second in
the number of quaifiers, with eight
men eligible. Drake was close behind
with seven. Coe and Iowa each quali-
fied two men, and Iowa State Teach-
ers college qualified one.

Moulton and Cretzmeyer of Iowa
were the individual stars of the pre-
liminaries. winning firsts in their
beats in both the high and low hur-
dle events. No records were endan-
gered in any of the preliminary trials.

The finals in both track and field
events were scheduled to start this
afternoon at 1:30 o'clock, according
to an announcement made last night
moving the time ahead from 2 p. m.

Marks Threatened

While most of the state marks
appeared safe from assault of those
competing today in the various
events, records were threatened in
three events. From past perform-
ances of state stars in the
high jump and 440-yard dash, new
standards in these events seemed
easily possible.

Last week Wessling, the Iowa
state star quarter-miler, won his race
in a duel with Missouri, being timed
in 49 flat. on Saturday, Dean of Iowa
won the quarter in a triangular meet
between Iowa, Wisconsin and North-
western in 49.3, Both Page of Iowa
and Barnes of Grinnell are also ca-
pable of beating so flat, and with
those four battling it out, the pros-
pects for a new mark seemed bright.

Star High Jiunper

Linn Philson, Drake sophomore,
who jumped better than 6 feet 3
inches at the Drake Relays, looked
like a possible record breaker in the
high jump. Both Stookey of Coc and
Warrington of Estherville Junior col-
lege have been coming close to the
