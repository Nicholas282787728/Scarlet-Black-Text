The Interscholastic track and field lilcct
which will he hold at \Vai'd field Saturday. and the
Iowa State high School meet to be held here on May
19, will bring 400 or 500 competing high school
athletes to the local campus. This is tllc largest
‘group of prep school students to gather at Gl-inlicll
in some time, and affords the school an unusual
opportunhy to demonstrate to a group of student
prospects tllc advantages and bcllcfits of attending
school here.

It. is not too much to asl; that the student body
do its utmost to make the stay of those )oung» Ill(‘l\
as pleasant and interesting as possible, especially
when this may be accomplished without the least
inconvenience.

The easiest \\'£I‘ of impressing the visitors
with sincerity of Grllniell‘s welcome is by personal
contact; by willingness to be of service, by engor-
ncss to make them feel at homo and by complete
friendliness.

The second manner of creating in lllL‘ minds of
these high school athletes an ag . rlblc impression
of Grinncll is by mere attendance at the two meets.
The interest portrayed by the local student ill the
track uud [icld prograli ' will mean just a nlurll

Other Opinions

EDUCATION 1N PEACE
(The Daily Illini)

“A course in peace,” advocated by The Daily Illini
as an antidote to compulsory military courses. has
gained recognition in the columns of the Nation's current
issue. We quote from that weekly:

"The perennial campaign against compulsory mili
tnry training on the campuses has taken a turn which
makes it still more difficult for university administrators
to evade or ignore the case of protesting students.

”Courses in peace training are now advocated—to
inform students of the causes and intrigues or war and
devices for the pacific settlement of international dis—
putes,

“It is ironicnl that the suggestion for so intelligent
an addition to the curriculum should come from the
University of Illinois, long the encampment of the large
est Reserve Officers Tr ing Corps brigade and for
many years presided over by Davrd Kinley, leading exV
poncnt of the mandatory view among the heads of land.
graut institutions.

"After several students who objected to military
training had been ousted from Ohio State university,
The Daily lllini, student newspaper at Illinms, urged
that ‘a course in peace' be required, concluding that ‘if
the university requires its students to spend three hours
a week for four semesters preparing for war, certainly
it should require them to spend as much time preparing
for peace.”

CIVILIZATION—MODEL 1934
(Oklahoma Daily)

Although the fact is rather horrifying to think of.
there seems to be no doubt that the young men of today
are to he the cannon fodder of tomorrow, for munitions
makers still continue to devise ways by which their
deaths will be more scientific in the war to come.

To demonstrate this fact, read this copy from an
advertisement inserted by the Cleveland Automatic Ma»
chine company in the American Machi ist:

“The following is a description of the 13 and 18
pound high explosive shells which are now being used
extensively to replace common shrapnel.

“The material is so high in tensile strength it is
very special because it has a tendency to fracture into
small pieces upon explosion of the shell. The timing of
the fuse for this shell is similar to the shrapnel shell,
but it differs in that two explosions or two explosive
acids are used to explode the shell in the large cavity.
The combination of these two acids causes terrific ex—
plosiolls, having more power than anything of its kind
yet used. Fragments become coated with the acids in
exploding, and wounds caused by them mean death in
terrble agony within four hours if not attended to im-
mediately.

“From what we are able to learn of conditions in
the trenches. it is not possible 1.0 get medical attention
to anyone in time to prevent fatal results, It is neces-
sary to immediately cauterlze the wounds if in the body
or head, or to amputate the limbs, as tlicrc Seems to
lie no antidote that will counteract the poison . . . , ”

Now the youth of the country knows that it can
expect immediate. horrible death in the event of another
war. And it also knows that the munitions makers
care not a damn for life; they are interested only in
pocketing mulley~money covered with the wet, sticky
lilood of innocent youths.

findings one group attacks the methods of education,
and another attacks the numbers being- c aled.

good a classification of students s wrvvc yet heard was
c sed dining an informal talk

Morse of the law school the other evening.

Five types of students enter the halls of- learning,
points out Dean Morse. The first. type includes the stu-
dent who is just plain indifferent, He goes to college
without knowing why; his folks foot the bill. He seldom
questions what his professors put forth, though economic
fears may prompt these dispensers of learning to with

hold the obvious if it seems a bit daring. He gets his de- ’

gree and becomes one or the millions.

The constitutional conservative falls into the second
group. He finds comfort in the status quo; why should
he argue and dream and plan and strive for change?
The here and now is its own defense and justification,
This group is quite often well versed in history or litera-
ture, but dynamic conclusions are not in the nature of its
members.

Third in the list is the hedonist, unconsciously So,

for he does not know hedonism is a philosophy. He knows ,

“pleasure and pain" as the leading motives of life. he
seeks the'clne and avoids the other. He it is who gives
the administration occasional trouble and must be repri-
manded or sent to another environment.

Fourth group is the idealist and crusader. He is the
most forceful of college students. He is the leader of the
leagues and protest movements; he embraces the cause
of freedom and justice. He is never at rest, and no ideal
is too impractical for his support.

And lastly there is the critical realist. He is the
doubter and skeptic. the eternal asker Of questions, He
has the courage to disagree, the energy and mental dis
eipline necessary far practical affairs, He knows how to
use the intellectual tools necessary in any directed at-
tack on the social problems of the day. Too often, how-
ever, lie lacks initiative, purpose, the drive that gets
things done.

Out of his deficiency comes the suggestion of the
union of the last two groups, the critical realist and the
idealist or crusader,
practical is the task of the realist; to give purpose to tho
realist, that of the idealist, With any group successfully
uniting these two eminently useful types of student, i1.
is possible to produce surprising results in fields of praise
tical social and political activity.
