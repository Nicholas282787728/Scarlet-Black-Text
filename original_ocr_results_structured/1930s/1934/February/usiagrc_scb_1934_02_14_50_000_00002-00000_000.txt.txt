Thus, dur )Q‘ the “car. a large number of cell-
toriiil subjrets ale discussed with the result. tllat in
many eases, student readers lose sight of the main
issues, Because of this. we, are printing tlle main
platform which The Searlot alid Blaek has lliailr
taillcd and will continue to maintain under its pro.
ellt nianageillellt;

1. Tile reorganization of student g‘ol'erniilellt
on the campus in sn h manner that governing bode
ies will have a de 'ilite knowledge of their duti ‘
and privileges. and that disciplinary powers will
be extended to the students.

2. The allolislllllellt of a number of trivial rules
governing residents of the quadrangle and then-
“dates.”

3. The establishment of a dramatic eollnril
which shall be lepresentative of the school ltlier
than of one department, and -the revival—same
do} fat the Pioneer Prudities.

4. The advancement of varsity athletie intern
cs particularly football—With the alternative of
withdrawing from the M ssuul-i Valley conference,
a elr lit ill which Grrililiell. its smallest illenlber.
has held a position of holior.

The list is by no means all inclusive. There are
general Snl [ct some of lvh h are of much more
Importance to mankind and society than the above.
Thescrgelicral subjects are discussed with vigor
iii nearly all college newspapers. The four points
above, lion-ere constitute problems peculiar to
Gl'inllell. There are other Sllt'll problems which will
be considered later.

DECISION DEBATES

[t is interesting to note that 3'3 out of Jo role
logos and illiiv sities queried by the Grilillell de-
bate director do not care to schedule decision de-
bates fo- illtc olle ate competition. Last year.
some agitation \i'a d on here for the resump-
tion of such debates, but it would seem that opinion
is against decisions.

Reasons given by debate directors for tlleir rc-
action included the difficulty of obtaining an illlr
partial audiollee decision, proliilli ve cost, of hiring
judge and the, belief that decision contests were
not conducive to good debating.

[t is true that audience decisions do not consti-
tue a good medium of judgment. However, the late
for reasons may he questioned. It would seem that
judges could be obtained at a Small cost from
among the impartial residents of the community in
which the contest takes place. In college town.
there are usually persons who are interested ill de-
bating, lint who are not connected with the school
in any way. As to the belief that. (let: . ion contests
are not conducive to good debating, there does not
seem to be any justification for such an opinion.
Competition is the essence of ally contest. A chance
of being credited with a victory should spur a cone
testallt to greater eiforc than he would expend if
he realized that winning or losing was of no consid-
eration.

“Because of the complexity of the
world, higher education has become
as inrlispcnsiblc as transportation in
th s life," declared Plesldellt John S.
Nollon.

Education, ho believes brings a
bout a convenient as ' iilation that
the youth needs. “Just gathering to-
gethcr of materials of education does
not insure education, but our atti-
tudes and accomplishments detox-
niinc the value of our opportniiitios,'
he continued.

“The student with no ellliosity is
out of luck," he declared

UNIVERSAL HIGHER EDUCATIONVALMOST
(The Creightoliinn)

B 0. Forbes, financial Writer, waxes optimistic in
the current number of his monthly magazine. Mr. Forbes
predicts a great many pleasant things. For example, we
are going to have “A greater and better prosperity than
ever before enjoyed." There are going to be more jobs
than worlrcrs, high wages, short hours, agricultural pros-
pei-ity,

Down near the bottom of the list of these eminently
rlesirahlc prophecies is this one: “Higher education avail-
able for almost all."

We are glad Mr. Forbes said "almost." We were
afraid for a moment that he was going to predict uni-
versal higher education. We were afraid that lie was go-
ing to suggest that college work would soon become a
requirement for every citizen of this pleasant dream
world of his.

It should not be and Mr. Forbes knows that. Many
critics will argue that; America has earned this higher
education idea too far. There are hundreds of thousands
of college students who would he much happier and more
useful elsewhere than in the learned halls. They and the
universities realize this. The parents and the general
public do not. Higher education is good for some people,
Ergo, it is good for everybody according to our Amerr
can democratic traditions.

It doesn't work out. Higher education is desirable
only where it is intensely desired. It is not something
that can be classed with prosperity, or with other sym-
bots of material advancement. Education is n means, an
aid in the process of self-development, and not an end in
itself. How soon will the average American finrl this
out?

THE OTHER. SIDE OF “EDUCATION FOR ALL"
(Daily Cardinal)

While other educational institutions in the country
may hall with unbounded enthusiasm the decision of the
federal govemment to offer part time jobs to needy stu-
dents on condition that the school they attend waive
their fees, the fact that Wisconsin will not be able to
take advantage of the new plan because of o statuetoi-y
restriction, is not as unfortunate as it would seem at
first.

Increase in enrollment without a subsequent
crease in revenue from fees would mean a decrease in
the faculties that can he offered to the students but this
would not he the greatest evil that might result from
government’s plan. The coming of the depression years
has deflated the value of a college degree considerably.
America’s old ideal of "an education for all" may have
given the lower classes greater opportunities for ad-
vancement, but it has also developed an education SySA
tern that of necessity must consider mass production its
mark of success. An excess of second rate men in our colr
leges has forced the adoption of teaching methods that
have prevented the real students from getting a real eds
ucation.

With all due sympathy to the poor student whose
talents exceeded his money, we are inclined to doubt the
value of a college education obtained while the student’s
main interest is the earning of room and hoard. Too are
ten the student ruins his health, obtains little more than
a sheepskin diploma for his efforts, and then finds that
this same diploma is of little use in further advancing
him in the world.

Editor,

The Scarlet and Black.
Dear S

It was with skepticism that I at
tended the first Gates lecture Tues-
day morning. I cxpected to hear a
metaphysxcal and theologie disserta-
tion. \Nllat I did hear was a pro-
founrl scientific and ethical discus
Sioi-l, The speaker rose above his
cloth. Or rather, he challenged inst
tuuonalized religion to strive uncom-
piomisingly toward the social idea]:
which he so eloquently presented.

What I appreciated in Rev Tittlc’s
second lecture was his thrilling clar-
ion can to action, to experiment, to
fulfill the teachings of Josus in an
nnChristian environment.

Rev. Tittle spoke not only as a
philosopher. but as a prophet. I was
surprised, agreeably so_ at his radi-
calism. To me, however, it was not
radicali n, but the only social truth.
If we're to become true Christians.
we'd better do so in a hilll‘y. Mars is
marching again.

Sincerely,
Manuel Brown.

Two Presidents Eulagized

“Let us now praise famous men,”

"Car . g, mnclri-ulring critics cans
