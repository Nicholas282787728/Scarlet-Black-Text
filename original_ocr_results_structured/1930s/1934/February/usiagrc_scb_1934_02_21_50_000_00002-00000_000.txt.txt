FRIENDLY RIVALRY
“This is the worst crowd I’ve ever semi,” do,-
clared Coach Doll White of the Washington univch
Sity basketball team in commenting on the chorus
of hoos and catcfllls at tho Grinncll-Bear game here
Monday evening.

Perhaps it was. At. least it was the most (US
courteous crowd to appear at a homo hashcthnll
game this seasoir Even a group of grade school
youngsters caught the spirit and aided in jccrillg
and yelling when Washington cagcrs attempted to
sink free throws.

Yet the crowd was not entirely to blame.
There seemed to lie an amazing lack of general
self-control, as evidenced not ollly by the specta-
tors, but the players. the officials, and the Wash-
ington coach himself. Mr. “White, it may he re-
called, was the man who caused a penalty to he
called on his team last year when he ran out on
tllc floor to protest a decision. Such an action, and
his similar actions Monday ci hing, are not of the
sort to quiet an excited crowd

As for the officials, with the score in ll doadr
lock, both at the end of the regular playing period
and the first overtime period, they lost control of
the players alld allowed the game to tllrn into ll
frce-for-all.

There is no moral to be drawn. Yet, does this
prove that sportsmanship is merely a lly-word, ap-
plicahlc only at times when excitement does not
make players and spectators forget that such a
thing exists? It would seem so. Perhaps the spirit
of professional baseball, in which fistic arguments,
pungent epithets, and showers of missiles zldd to
the enjoyment of the fans, is being extended to
college sports, particularly in the Grinncll gymna-
Sinm. IPerhaps Grinucll spectators wish all of their
games to be conducted in such a slip-shod manner.
If so, all that is needed to make the picture Comr
plctc is a supply of pop-llottlcs to throw 1i; tllc of-
ficials, choice and distinctive yocahula 9 come
hillcd with loud voices, and the discontinuance of
any pretence of maintaining a spirit of friendly
rivalry with visiting tennis.

ETIQUETTE

1\ required non-credit class ill etiquette for
Grilnlcll college students has been suggested lly the
Council of House Presidents. Although there might
he those who would maintain that ethics of inter
nationalism or religion would satisfy a greater
need as a rcqu cd subject, and that social ctiquctlc
is but superficial; yet it is certain that the gradu-
ates of a college which makes any cultural prctcn-
siolls whatsoever should be able to take tllcir places
in society with some degree of poise and the knowl-
edge of correct procedure.

Such a knowledge is supposedly a part of home
training, but this is not always the case. There
have been cases of college graduates who were ig-
norant of. the simplest rules of proccdnl'e in pic
scnting strangers, iii acknowledging introductions
and ill selecting the right folk or spoon at the din
ncr table,

A course similar to that suggested p the
house presidents would he one of thos things
which are of; no financial value, perhaps, but which
make life pleasontcr and easier for the individual.

Polished lllllnllcrs are distinctive ill a spur, I'a
world and are a cllllrllctrr' tic which tlu: most, VI

insignificant sum, but this fund will mean a great
deal to thousands of students and scores of small,

COURSE IN ETIQUETTE
(Gee Cosmos)
It “(ﬂuid seem that college students should be as well
versed in the niceties of etiquette as they are in the facts

of parliamentary procedure. In fact it might even be
well to institute such a course as a, requirement on all

curriculums, in view of what the world expects of col-
lege students or graduates in the way of conduct.

Although it might be argued that college people
should know the simple rules of etiquette, it could be
pointed out that many reach their graduation day with-
out the remotest idea of the proper way to make intro-
ductions or which fork to use on the salad. Is it not
just as important to know these everyday courtesies
as to know how to table a motion or adjourn a meet»
ing’.’

Such a course in etiquette need not take much
time from other school work and could be offered as a
companion or sister course to parliamentary law. which
requires only an hour a week here. An hour a week

would be far too little in which to learn an the proprie-
ties of conduct, but at least such a course would make

many people manner~censeious and provide the rudi-
ments of an education in the social graces.
”G—
COLLEGE MEN AND venues
(The Santa Claus)

Of late there has been a great deal of discussion
on the absence of college men in politics.

The trouble seems to be that a college graduate
with a fair training in history. political science, and eco-
nomies, is unable to capitali his education when he
looks for a position in the ci l service. on the other
hand, however, he finds that banks and business corpor—
ations will offer him posts above the clerical grade,
with well-defined opportunities of promotion to execu-
tivc positions.

There has been little effort, except in technical
training, to attract college graduates to careers in pub~
lie service The sad fact is that, while college students
are more interested in public affairs than any other
group of our population, few actually enter governments
al employment.

It. is true that the government does not offer the
high financial return which exceptional success in busi-
ness or private practice affords. Again it is true that
many of the young graduates are anxious to gather in
the money. But is poor pay the chief detriment? if pub-
lic office enjoyed high prestige and young men leaving
college could be offered careers leading ultimately to
posts of distinction and importance. the pull of public
services would counterbalance the poor pay.

The public service is not thought of so much as a
career which one enters in early life and continues, with
reasonable promotion, until retirement, but. as a con-
geries of special occupations, requiring for each a par-
ticular vocational equipment. The government has de-
manded special fitness in candidates, rather than caps-
city for development.

As a result, the young college man with a general
arts degree, has found government work closed to him
as a professional career devoid of politics.
