Ballot Friday

to Determine
Council Plan

FacultyAccepts Constitution
After Making Slight

Alteration

Approval of the revised Student
Council constitution by the faculty
committee on student organizations
was practically assured this after--
inoun following the council's action
on faculty recommendations yester-
day. Major revisions of the document
remain as they were suggested a
week ago.

Action was first taken on the con-
stitution a week ago Sunday by the
council which approved the revised
document drawn up by a committee
headed by Dwight Campbell, presie
dent. The matter was presented to
the faculty Monday, April 9, and
that body made its recommendation
on Monday of this week, approving
all features except the original proe
visions that the chairman of the rec-
reation committee and the auditor
he placed on half-board positions.

Vote Friday

The proposition was explained by
Campbell to the student body at
chapel yesterday and final action was
then taken by the council on faculty
recommendations yesterday after-
noon. After bringing the matter to
the attention of a faculty committee
this afternoon, a poll of the student
body will be taken Friday, according
to Campbell, and if approval is ex-
pressed. primary and final elections
of the executive committee of the
council will be held next week.

Following faculty recommenda-
tions. the council yesterday decided
to place the chairman of the recrea-
tion committee on a straight salary
of $50 a semester, rather than to
give him a half-board 'job. and to
maintain the'auditor on an hourly
pay basis.

Minor Changes

Several further minor changes
made yesterday by the council in-
clude the placing of three members
on the recreation committee, desig»
nating of one man and one woman
for representation on the dramatic
council, rather than simply "a com»
mittee of two,” and stipulation of
the amendment of the by-laws by a
two-thirds vote of the council.

In addition to full membership on
the faculty committee on student
organizations and advisory rcpresem
tation on the curriculum committee,
the Student Council president, or a
member appointed by him, may rep
resent the student body on the ad-
ministrative, chapel, athletic, educae
tional policies, lecture and social
committees, the faculty decreed this
week.

Tom Gordon, '35, member of the

this week. When queried today.
Coach Les Duke declared that the
burden of the explanation rested
on Cordon, Gordon in turn de-
clared that he had no explanation
to make.

It was reported, however, on
good authority that the difficulty
came about because of Gordon’s

Five Enter Kansas Relays;

Balance of Team to Run
at Cedar Falls I

Five track men will enter the Kan—
sas relays at Lawrence. and the bal-
ance of the squad will go to Cedar
Falls for the Iowa State Teachers
college relays Saturday, Coach Lester
Duke decided following time trials
Tuesday afternoon.

Anderson, Clark, Barnes, Bentley,
and Pheiffer are the men who will
go to Lawrence. The first four will
enter the mile relay, and possibly the
half-mile relay, while Pheitfer will
enter the 1.500 meter run. Clark's
entry in the high hurdles has also
been sent in, but it is doubtful if he
will compete.

Already weakened by the loss of
five men to the Kansas relays, the
squad going to Cedar Falls will also
be without an enlly in the hurdles.
Dickinson spiked himself last night
and will not be able to run for several

Bair, McKlveen, Mason, and Lang-

yard dash.

, Revival Given
Consideration

Politics Suggested asTheme;
Author Would Receive
Third of Profits

A plan for an all—college revue to
be presented during the third or
fourth Week in February, 1935, was
drawn up by the dramatic council
late Saturday. and will be submitted
for approval of the student body.

The revue. as outlined. will not
follow the plan of the' productions of
the Pioneer Prudities, presented by
Sigma Delta Chi and the National
Collegiate Players in 192349 and
1929-30, but has several innovations,
with the purpose of improving the
creative writing efforts of those sub-
mitting manuscripts.

Author Wins Prize

According to the plan, one third
of the profits derived from the two
performances on a Friday and a. Set
urday, will be given to the author or
authors of the production, while the
remaining two-thirds will be placed
in a scholarship fund for students
with creative writing or dramatic
ability,

Manuscripts of the entire produc-
tion of six acts, or any portion there-
of. must be presented by Thanksgiv-
ing day next fall. There are to he 12
characters in each act, and each act
must have a playing time of from 12
to 20 minutes. Individuals or groups
of individuaLs ., may submit manu-
scripts.

Polltical Theme

The theme of “politics" has been
suggestion by the dramatic council
for the revue, but need not be fol—
lowed to the letter, according to Sara
Sherman Pryor, head of the drama
department. Authors are to sign
their books with a fictitious name,
submitting a sealed envelope with
their correct name within and the
fictitious name outside. Judges will
be from outside the college.

Representatives of each hall and
cottage desiring to participate in the
revue, will meet next fall to draw
lots and make plans. Authors may
designate the producing group air
their individual acts.

Expenditures Limited

The stipulation has been made
that no producing group may spend
more than 55 for costumes and sim-
ple properties. The amount of these
expenditures will be returned provid-
ed an itemized bill is presented to
the dramatic council immediately
after the production.

Rehearsals are not to take longer
than thl'ee weeks preceding the per-
formances.

Directors, writers and participants
must measure up to college eligibil-
ity rules.

Trophies to Buildings

It is hoped by the dramatic coun-
cil that the affair will be biennial, al-
ternating with the Women's dance in-
tramurals. At least one dancenumber
will be presented in each act of the
revue.

According to the plan drawn up by
the council. "suitable trophies will
be presented to the house and cot-
tage that produce the winning act.
These may be retained until they are
won by some other house or cottage
in following years."

The Grinnell chapter of National
Collegiate Players will be in general
charge of production, and the Grinncli
chapter of Sigma Delta Chi will be
in charge of publicity, according to
the plan. The dramatic council will
appoint a business manager.
