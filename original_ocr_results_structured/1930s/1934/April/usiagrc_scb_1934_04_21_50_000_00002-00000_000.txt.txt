A FRESH START

“'ith toda‘ no of The Scarlet and Black.
the reills are taken up by a new lllanagculeut.
There are no plans nllderl to inaugurate allv
startling-z reforms or to estab lsh ally lllnjor editor-
ial policies whit-ll were not observed by the reti ' _
lllaltazclllellt. Neither is it proposed to draw up
a definite platform at this tilllc‘.

As far as campus politics are concerned. we
shall endeavor to follow the same path as (lid the
lllanageulent which we succeed. Only one of the
illlprovolllonts which the latter pledged itself to
seek upon tel. no office last ye. ~ has not been no.
colllplislled. This concerns the advance allllouuco
mont of chapel programs. Believing that chapel at.
tendalloe would increase considerably if this poll v
was adopted. and that chapel should offer a very
real means of establishing a closer relationship be-
tweell the students, we shall continue to seek the
adoption of this custom.

Two other aims of the retiring adlllillistl'ation
have apparently been accompl 'llcd. The revival of
the Pioneer Prndities though ill a some, 'hat al-
tered form. is practically nssurcd for next year.
More important still, tllc Student (‘ollncil has
aroused itself from its lethargy alld successfully dc-
lnalldcd incl-cased powers wllich should make it a
very genuine force on the. campus. \Vc shall do
everything ill our power to see that these two pro-
jects meet with the success that they deserve.

The onl)~ immediate change to be sought is that
of referring to all the women’ cottages by their
Correct name a matter which is discussed in any
other editorial ill this issue. While this demand is
somewhat inconsequential. we feel that it is com-
pletcly reasonable alld one to which the students
should accede.

Further changes, improvements and reforms
will be broached only when. and if. such action is
gonnillcy needed. Our primary aim for the COlllr
ing year will be to keep The Scarlet and Black coul-
plctcly representative of the students: to reflect
their desires and opinions, and to seek the fulfillr
ulllcnt of all fair and justifiable demands made by
t eln.

Gr
SMOKE SCREEN

Reports from the meeting of the llew Council
of House Presidents Thursday evening indicate
that no action was taken on the proposition, sulr
mitted By the Women’s Self Govemment league,
that Women guests at men’s open houses be allowed,
to smoke at such affairs providing that tllc council
approve the step.

Arguments against the proposition, advanced
rather incoherently, include the old saw about not
“lilting to see womcll smoke,” and the careless
statements that cigaret butts would litter the floors
of tho clubrooln : that the ruling would influence
parents agail 't ending their daughters to Grill-
nell; and that. after all, there is a college ruling
against. women’s smoking outside of one room ill
the quadrangle.

First, it must be admitted by all concerned that
a very large percentage of (irinncll college women
do smoke If tradition prevents them—or anyone
else for that Illattcrifronl smoh lg in such plncrs
as the quadrangle dining room or about the cam-
pns, tllat matter is not com led, Yet, when men
bring guc is to open house. light up cigarets for
themselves but are not allowed to ext lid to the .
:1th S the privilege of smoking. it ccms not only
ridi ,llolls but a Serious breach of etiquette.

Inasmuch as the Women’s Self Government
lcagnc declared itself not opposed to women sulnlo
inq at open houses, the argument concerning the
college ruling s not valid. Such a narrow state-
mcnt as “not lilting;r to see, women smoke” need not
even be considered by tolerant, educated persons.
As for littcrillg flool , surely women can he; ' cone
s dcratc ill this respect as men. There now remains
only the argument that thc lnovc would adre scly
affect the enrollment of women at the college. 'l‘h
argument, we believe, is behind all of the othcl

right quillbling.

In answer. it may be said that. such a move
would not be for tho pin-pose of encouraging the
smoking habit among u-omcn, hut merely to more
Him) a condition which exists. It must be admitted
that the double standard in regard to smoking no
longer *ists. The women’s smoking roonl is proof
of this. And parents who do not wish their daugh»
it s to smoke would look . mice at tllc smoking
room before they would cons dcr the freedom of
smoking at open houses.

The whole matter boils down to a question of
etiquette. \Vhy should there he (llSt’l'llllllIr'lidOll

ra her than tahlillg the matter. the Council of
llouse Presidents should give the matter imulcdi-
atc consideration.

CALL A SPADE A SPADE

One of the aims of the newly installed board of
the \Volllell’s Self Government league " to estab-
lish the habit of referring to all cottage. by their
correct names. Upon the surface the matter seems
rather trifling, but upon deeper consideration fl
number of very justifiable reasons for establishing
this custom become apparent.

lll the fit t place, Cleveland, James. ‘Ilaint‘s
and Read, 1 c Main and Men s cottag were so
named to preserve the memory of solne individual
whose scrx to Grillnoll was outstanding: in def
crcnce to these loyal (iriuncllialls, if for no other
reason, it is only fair to call the cottages by their
correct names.

There is, however, a still more pri til‘aI ‘oason
for adopting this custom. lll the past. I deuce
ill Main or Me. ll s llla d a woman as a fr sh-
lnan. Not that it. is sel ously detrimental to
create a distinction of this sort llctwoell residents
of the numbered cottages alld the women ill those
referred to by proper llﬂlllt‘S. lllll it Seems a rather
unnecessary distil lion and one that might be
abandoned with profit. lll view of the plan to house
freshmen ill Cleveland cottage next year, ill alldi
tiou to “cars and hlaill. the lleecss ) for clilllillat-
' artificial distinction between re ’dcllts cl"
Ilulllbcrcd alld lltlllllld cottages i. stllllcwhllt ills
excused.

Finally, with the exception of Cleveland. which
requires tho spt‘alte 'to utter two syllables lllSlOi‘kl
of one. the arrcct llanuls of the r‘ottac‘es can be
used with as much ‘ 'e and convenience as the (ills
salt-to numbers. It s mph- a matter of hlonlsinc
all old habit and formingv a new one. With the t-o~
operation of the students zlud faculty, the, close of
the current school year can find Cleveland. llamcs.

GOVERNMENT TRAINING
(Tulane Hullabaloo)

For the first time in the history of the United
States a training school for young men and women
who desire to make careers out of political sciences
will open when The National Institute of Public Affairs
gets under way in Washington in 1935, Under the cur
torship of 20 nationally known university professors
and members of President Roosevelt’s “Bruin Trust.”
the students will be instructed for three months in the
functions, organization, procedures anel various admin-
istrative and legislative undertakings of the Federal
government.

The National Institute was first proposed at the
Ninth Annual congress of the National Student Fed—
eration of America in Washington during the Christ-
mas holidays by Chester H. McCall, assistant secre-
tary of commerce. Since that time, through the
N. s. F. A, the proposal has become a reality and so»
cial and scientific governmental agencies throughout
the nation have endorsed it.

According to plans every branch of government
will be Studiediexecutivc, legislative and judicial.
Students will be given the opportunity to observe the
inner workings and organizations of the departments
of the executive branch as well as to note the func-
tioning of the law making division, The program calls
for lectures by government officials, open-forum dis—
cussions, and the actual placing of theories into prac-
tice.

It is proposed that the privately financed institu-
tion will be entirely nonpartisan and noo-faoticnal.
It has for its purpose the instruction of college edu»
eatcd men who desire to serve in governmental capac-
ities. The students, who will study in the institute,
will be selected from junior, senior and graduate class-
es on a plan similar to that used in the selection of
Rhodes scholars.

It is needless to go into a. discussion as to why the
United States can profitably use such a training
school. For many years the charge has been made that
government in America is slow and sometimes ineffi-
cient because it does not attract the highest type citi
zens to fill its offices, and because political abuse is
too frequent.

These charges cannot be denied or ignored. The
civil service has worked in the United States, but not
so well as the service in Great Britain. This is explained
by the fact that in Britain professionally trained men
enter the service of government, and also by the fact
that the civil service offi als in Britain require broad
general training for office rather than technical infor-
mation.

The National Institute of Public Affairs certainly
deserves the support of the United states government.
It undoubtedly, if properly conducted, wiu aid mater-
ially in the administration and improvement of public
rcsponsibilit' s.

‘()llscl 'aiion ill pas illg: Some men achieve
l'amc by saying a hot) llll in two 01' three son-
(cnet iotllcrs accomplish the same foot by being
able to talk for hours—talk beautifully—and never
say a word.
