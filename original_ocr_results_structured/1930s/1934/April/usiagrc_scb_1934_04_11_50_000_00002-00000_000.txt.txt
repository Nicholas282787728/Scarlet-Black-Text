u A STEP FORWARD
Tlle full significance of the revised constitution
of the Student Council, pl‘eesuted by Dwight Callin-
bell for the consideration of the facility committee,
may not be grasped by casually glancing over the
list of changes.

Students have long expressed dissatisfaction
with the present culnbelsome system of student
government. For that reason, the working unit of
the council has been cllt to on executive connnittee
of seven members, which will act on all matters ex-
cept allotment of selncst ' fee funds, on which all
members of the council will act.

Tlle manner of electing the president of the
group and the special committees has also been a
thorn in the side of the student body. As nomina-
tions were made by the outgoing council, students
had no choice lint to vote for the men presented,
and the election nas controlled, as it were, by the
bosses.

Then, too, the powers of the council, outside of
apportioning the semester fees, have been practic-
ally nil. If, as outlined, tllc president of the group
shall beech-e a member, with full voting power. of
the faculty committee on student organizations,
and shall meet with the curriculum committee
when students matters are discussed, lunch misun-
derstanding between student and faculty groups
will be eliminated.

A complete record of all students who have
signed notes for collegediills is asked byrthe new
constitution. so that when the notes are finally
paid, the Student Council may be advised as to the
receipt of the semester fee.

The entire student body will be repr sented on
the dramatic council, if the new constitution is ac-
cepted, by means of the provision placing a com»
mittee of two from the Student Council on the dra-
ma group. Thus, the student body will have a
voice in the matter of selecting plays and deciding
the policies of student drama productions.

,Tllere are other changes, all of which will be
explained ill a mass meeting next week, following

i cuhy action on tile blotter.

DENIAND FOR COLLEGE BIE
(Oklahoma Daily)

An effort to get the “brain trust" idea extended to
state and local government has been started by students
at the University of Chicago and Northwestern universi-
ty. They advocate, to start the movement, an organiza»
tion to interest college men in political careers,

The idea expressed, is, of course. contrary to that
voiced a few years ago by men at one of the older east»
ern universities. They contended then that politics was
so filthy that the college man should not contaminate
himself by participation. .

Opposition has also been registered by old style poli-
ticians when professors have talked about "going into
politics." college trained men have been classed as the»
orists with impractical ideas.

However. the pre-depression laments of the pessi-
mists have been largely discredited. For example, the
elder Lanuett, who won renown as a statesman, never
hesitated to consult educators at his state university.
And during the period of his influence. Wisconsin had
the reputation of being one of the best governed states.

And to put the old guard completely to rout. the
more progressive ideas of the “new deal” may be direct
ly credited to the influence of college trained rnen.

To the Editor I

Editor, The Scarlet and Black.
Sir:

Through some inadvertence a para-
graph was omitted, in Saturday's
Scarlet and Black. from the review or
Edward Shadbolt's recital, and it
made me scorn to omit any reference
to the very fine performance of the
Rachmaninoff concerto by Mr. Shad-
bolt and his colleague, Keith Daven-
port, who played the orchestral parts
on the organ,

The pronounced success of this
collaboration between piano and or-
gan, one of the most difficult of all
types of ensemble playing on ac-
count of the disparity in response be-
tween the two instruments, was a
bright laurel in the crown of these
two young artists. It deservedly
brought an immediate and genuine
response from the audience, so that
they had to come back and play part
of it again. I am glad to have the
opportunity to make this achiever
merit a matter of record, and to ex»
press the hope that we may hear Mr.
Shadbolt and Mr. Davenport as fre-
quently as possible.

H. w. Matlaok.

Program Saturday Evening
Attracts Large Crowd
Despite Conflict

(By II. w. MATLACK)

Forty years of steady devotion to
the art of choral singing were both
celebrated and exemplified in the for-
tietb annual home concert of the
Grinnell college Men's Glee club in
Herrick chapel Saturday evening. Al-
though the club had to share the
chapel wrth'Sherwoorl Eddy, and the
evening with both Mr. Eddy and a
college dance, its power to attract
and entertain a large audience once
more proved itself.

The club itself, in balance, tone-
quality, and vigor is among the most
satisfactory of many years, They
wisely concentrated on a few songs
and the “Sunset Trail," and did them
all wonderfully well. The quartet
was especially fine, both in choice
of numbers and the liveliuess of their
singing. and all around it seems good
to have the club get away a little
from the archeologieal tendency of a
few years ago, and ”sing something
Simple" by way of contrast,

Dick Kuncl's solos gave his fine,
smooth voice. and his easy, clear
manner of singing, the best chance
in the world, which his audience real-
ized and made him come back and
sing again, His accompanist. in fact
the accompanist for the whole pro-
gram. was Sabeth Mix, whose fluency
and taste need only a little more
rhythmic vigor to make her a superb
accomplice in all presentations of fine
music.

Earl Van Rees played the adagio
from Bruelrs violin concerto. It's too
bad we have to graduate Earl just
when he is getting well known to us.
After his solo the Alumni song made
one of its all too infrequent appear-
ances, and such old timers as have
any voice left got up and joined in
the chorus.

The big event was Kerr and Blum’s
rousing cantata, "On the Sunset
Trail." Each time this is heard it
makes a new impression of its out-
standing excellence in its field. Pic-
turesque, romantic, full of music and
fun of singableness, it deserves each
time a larger measure of acclaim. A
few slight deviations from normal in
the solo or orchestral parts were ob-
literated by the splendor of the cho—
ruses.

Trustees Appoint Committee
to Consider Prize Awards

A committee was appointed from
the college trustees at their meeting
Monday, according to President

 

Balance, Tone Quality, Vigor of Concert
by Men’s Glee Club Praised by Critic

John s. Nollen, to investigate the
awarding of all prizes, given in com-
petition during the college year. This
committee will make its report to the
trustees at their June meeting.

The action will not affect the a-
warding of any prizes this year,
president Nollen stated,
