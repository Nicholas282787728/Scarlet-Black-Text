A NEW SPIRIT
A now spirit on the campus, mentioned by
Marion Frye. president elect of the Council ot‘
House Presidents, ill addressing the men of the col-
lege in the dormitory dining room Thursday ove-
nillg. is easily discernible this spring.

From all indications, attendance at Grinllell
will boom next fall. Tntcrost in student gore - l-
lncnt has increased tremendously with the submit—
tal of the new Student Conllol constitution. .\ll
allovcravernge basketball season and prospects for
one of the busiest and most interesting lionic tin l;
seasons ill on - have helped to erase the memory
of a disllei cniug‘ football record. The reduction
ill college expenses has removed another source ol‘
discontent. Finally, Grinllell by establishing com»
prehensive examinations and following the most
np-to-date educational methods, is adding to its
store of traditions the feature 01’ modernity. with
its resultant effect on the spi ts of the students
and faculty members.

There is but one gloomy note ill the entire
scene. The response to Coach “Fuzz" Watt’s call
for spring football practice has been pitifully small.
Next fall ’s outlook ill the grid sport, frankly. is not
good. But let us hope that the impending season
will DC the last of its kind.

PROPAGANDA RULES

“The United States has now restored normal
relations with Soviet Russia. We naturally think
that the restoration of normal diplomatic relations
between them, two good neighbors of Japan, in-
valves a scheme to surround Japan for some mill»
my purpose.”

This statement, made by all admiral of tllc Jae
pancse Navy, was quoted by Senator William E.
Borah. in a speech condemning the Vinson naval
replacement bill, to illustrate the influence of
propagundists in coloring international news.

Munition manufacturers, Senator Bomb point»
ed out, were obviously the disseminntors of this
vicious and purely unfounded rumor. To such
firms, he contined, “a naval race, or anything that
looks like a naval race, is a Christmas holiday ”
They are bound to aggravate the situation in o
cry conceivable way, inciting homeland and oppo-
ncnt alike, and selling to both indiscriminately
when a breech s opened.”

As a number of the speakers at the recent coll
fol-once on this campus stated, the naval oompetlr
tion between the United States and Japan is one of
the most likely sources of war in the world today4
not, certainly, the most dangerous, but neverthe-
less a possible source.

To pass the bill under consideration, Mr. Borah
asserted, would be to abet the armament interests
in their program to hurl the wol'ld into another
conﬂict. Vi’hy, if Japan interpreted the United
States’ recognition of the U. S. S. R, on the basis of
motives completely ulterior to the mere re-estab-
lishment of friendly relations, should not the J apar
nesc be even more aroused by the following 11n-
nouncement of a largo appropriation for armi-
lnent purposes? This would, tho senatordcclal‘cd,
be directly to the advantage of the parties who
originated the former-propaganda,

“No treaty, no law made by mail or God cone
trols nnlnition lllanufftcturers,” the congressman
warned. The approp iation under consideration
amounted to 500 million dollars, and provided for
the purchase of scores of destroyers and subma-
rines, hundreds of airplanes. But the influence of
the propagandists prevailed. The bill was passed.

HUMAN NATURE

Many of us still believe, that human nature
can’t be changed. We think of war, prolitrsccking
and exploitation as instinctive in man, and that
these things are “human nature.” Often we ll 11'
someone say: “We'll always have war bcuilu , it
is natural for man to fight,” or, “Thcrc’ll always
be rich and poor, master and slave, because it is

human nature to try to got ahead, oven at. the cxv
pcllse ol‘ ollc's fellowmen.”

A SIMILAR SITUATION.

college. Allie. c '[llflills :l situation at that school
which is very similar to the our at (lrinllcll ill
reg ‘U‘Ll to tllc question of women smoking.

A smoking room for Iowa State coed. h'
l'ccclltly been established Although recogni
this as nu iuuu-u olncllt o i- the previous situation,
the editor of Tho Student asks why the woman who
smokes hol- igal'et in the “Cyclone Cellar” should
be blameless wllilt‘ the one who lights up as she
walks on the. campus is “collllliittillg ll cardinal

Smoking among Grillnell college women, as
among colleg women throughout the country, has
grown to such an extent that it must eventuully hc

Other Opinions

TH NI\FUL FOR Tim nECOGNlTio
(louu state Student)
The Cyclone Cellar in Memorial Union is now offi-
eislly recognized as the women's smoking room on the
campus. .

unofficially it has been known in that light since it
was opened more than a year ago. Not until Tuesday.
however, was its status given the sanction of the ad-
ministration.

Thus the first semblance of a foundation has been
laid for what may. it is hoped, in time bridge the gulf

between student and administrative opinion on the
question of women's smoking.

The step in itself, signifying that the administration
has recognized the situation and the consensus among
students. has much more far-reaching implications than
the more recognition of the smoking room.

In reality it indicates that the administrative recog-
nizes that smoking among women on the campus, and
women in general. is not an immoral practice.

It rccognizes‘that the student body of rows State is
made up of mature men and women, able to make their
own decisions without the admonishing finger of college
officials to govern their private habits. Iowa state co-
eds are now being classified as women instead of high
school girls.

It is a step ahead, and very commendable one.

With its innovation, however. the smoking question
in general is crystallized into a situation that is. at best.
anomalous.

in other words the situation seems to be this:

"Women who confine their smoking to one certain
room are approved. Those who step beyond the confines
of this certain room when smoking are to he definitely
classed among the black sheep.”

The coed who, feeling the urge to smoke, dons hat,
coat and galoshes and trips merrily across to the Cy-
clone ceuar to have her cigaret is purged.

Her sorority sister, however, who lights a cigaret as
she walks home with her boy friend after classes is
committing a cardinal sin.

Thus it seems that the women are still being di
criminnted against. In comparison with their brothers,
The distinction is it little hard to see.

PRINCETON FINDS THE ROAD To PROGRESSIVE
EDUCATION
(Daily Cardinal)

Gone are the pleasant days when colleges and uni—
versities of the east can rest smugly on memories of
pest laurels and ivyrcovered tradition while other insti-
tutions of higher learning entertain progressive and rad~
ical academic trends. The Daily Princetonian recognizes
the need for educational innovations in rock-ribbed eon-
servative institutions in an editorial attacking the ante
worn academic system at Princeton.

students have ceased to attend college for the pur-
pose of acquiring a charming broad A'd accent, an ath-
letic letter or the advantages of exclusive club life. san-
ity, practicability, and awareness of the problems facing
students after graduation are becoming the necessary
factors in college training.

As outmoded universities realize the inadequacy of
their educational set-up they must radically change their
policies. They must strenuously overhaul their curricula
and modernize such relics as the four course plan or the
preceptorial plan as pursued at Princeton, They must
keep in step with the progress of their contemporaries
by recognizing that educational institutions should nev-
er stand still but should lead the race for progressive
thought.

Managing Editor,

Dear sir:

I wonder if it would be possible
for me, as one of the delegates to
the student Convention on Interna-
tional Relations, to send a message
to Grinuell college through The Scar-
let and Blackv If that were possible,
I would enjoy giving the following
message to cl-iunell college and
pecially to the members of the vari-
ous committee of the Conference:
Dear Friends:

Many of we delegatesiyes, I am
quite sure, all of lls-—feel that we
have had in this conference an ex-
porieuee that has been a rare privir
legc. We only regret that we have
neglected to grasp an opportunity in
Grinncll to thank our hosts. There
fore, I wish to take this opportunity
to thank Grinnell college for its
splendid part in making the confer»
enec a success. I know that all dele-
gates JOIN me in this appreciation of
your efforts to give us a fine meet»
ing.

We feel that we are indebted to
all of you, to the student body which
has been so courteous and sharing
with us, to President Nollen who has
been :1 real host, and especially to
the members of the various comm
tees which have worked so dil»
gently and faithfully to make us
comfortable, happy, and, may I say,
through their splendid success in gi .
ing us the very finest speakers and
leaders, more intelligent.

Be assured that we all have a pro-
found admiration for the success you
had in making this conference mean
