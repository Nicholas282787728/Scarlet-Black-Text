PROVINCIALISM?
(Daily Trojan) .

“The college newspaper is growing
provincial"

That is what a sociology professor
at Yale told a group of eastern col-
lege editors recently, and with him we
disagree.

Provincialism has been one of the
faults of the college newspaper of the
past, unfortunately. Few editors
have looked beyond their own cum-
puses for material to run in their
columns, and few have bothered to
inquire what was going on in the
world and interpret it. for their read
ers. But. to say that provincialism
is growing is an untruth, because it
is actually on the decline.

If one were to compare the college
newspaper of five or 10 years ago
with the present day edition, one
would be surprised at the wider va-
riety of stories and editorial topics
which are printed today A graduate
student at this university made such
or survey of the Daily Trojan recently
and found to his surprise that the
number of oft-campus news stories
had increased seven times "I the last
10 years, and that the increase in edir
torials about world and national af-
fairs had been tremendous. Ten ycars
ago current topics Were seldom if
ever recorded in thc editorial coir
umns; today thc paper has become
both a mirror and moldcr of public
opinion.

This doesn't. indicate a growth of
provincialism locally. Neither do we
believe that college newspapers gen-
crally are growing along narrowcr
lines. other Pacific Coast; papers, es-
pecially, bear this out, for at least
three of them print intelligent discus-
sions of state, national, and interna»
tional politics and sociological prob-
lems. In the Middle West there are a
dozen which reach out beyond the
cnmpus for editorial topics. Among

NO!

thesc papers provinciulism is on
Wane.

It must not be supposed that the
greater interest of the college editor
in affairs of government and the na-
tion is due 1.0 a remarkable and pe-
Culiar influx of intelligence into tho
editorial chairs of thc nation's univcr-
sities. Rather it; is but an indication
of the greater consciousness on the
part of youth in the importance of
acquiring curly both a. knowledge or,
and an interest in government.
