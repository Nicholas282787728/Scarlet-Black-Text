Envy of Friends

When a Grinnell co—ed glories in the

ing, it is quite enough to cause one
to raise his eyebrows in wonder; but
when her room—mate and cottage sis»
ters gather around and handle the
discarded apparel with envy, an in.
vestigation is certainly in order.

Just such a situation was created
last weekend when a large box was
delivered at the quadrangle, addressed
to Louise Goodwin, “in care of John
s. Nollen," and insured for 31m. The
inhabitants of Read cottage, where
Miss Goodwin serves as house chair.

Alter a scoreless first quarter in
which Clark held the nonhenders on
even terms, Dibble gained a 6 to 3
advantage at the hall. Coming back
strong in the second half, Dibble kept
the ball in Clark’s territory and
throttled their offense for the rest of
the game.

Royal’s field goal in the second
quarter started the Dibble march. La
Masney tied the count for Clark, but
Kicker added another boot between

Ricker each scored one in the fourth,
and Dean threw a pass to McCully
for the only score of the game via

considerable yardage through the air.

during the balance of the iirst period,
and the quarter ended as Clark kicked
to the Creighton 28-yard stripe.

In the second period, Grinnell cm.
