his or her successor is elected. After this mo»

Cecil F. Lavell’s ”Biography of the

John S. Notion in the Review of Re-

It was the deliberate iudgmeiit of
Prof G. T. \V. Patrick so long and
so favorably lmonu at the state uni.
versity that the Athenians at their best
were the greatest siv-glc group of
people the world has yct known,
There were eight world tiger-cs in
Athens at one time. It would be hard
for even the United States in our
hundred and filty years to name more
than three.

Professor Lavcll has told the story
at this group in his “Biography of the
Greek People" ill the most direct
and at the same time most interesting
way possible, beginning back in the
hazy times “from 3000 B. Q to about
1500 E. C." and running down over
the thousand and more years in which
the Hellencs led the world. (It is a
