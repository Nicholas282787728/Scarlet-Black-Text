Bulldogs Win
Muddy Battle
by 8-0 Score

Third Quarter Touchdown,
Safety Give Drake
Another Victory

By JACK KELSEY

In a game featured by mud, punts
and fumbles, Drake added another
victory to its string over Grinnell by
an 8-0 count last night. Intermittent
downpours throughout the contest
turned the field into a quagmire, han.
dicapping offensive efforts of both
teams.

After two scoreless quarters, the
Bulldogs plunged, slipped and slid to
the touchdown that foretold the Drake
victory, and then practically clinched
the game in the same period by
tackling Clark behind his own goal
for a safety, after he had fumbled.

Potts Gains Ground

Despite the mushy held. Jack Potts,
Drake halfback, sloshed and skated
his way through large holes in the
Grinnell line for consistent gains
throughout the game.

The only touchdown of the game
can be accredited almost solely to him,
for in the third period he received
Clark’s kickoff, and tramped to the
Grinneil 41 yard line, and after foul:
more downs,, in which he figured
heavily, he dove and then with a grid
version of the American crawl, swam
through right tackle for 10 wards and
the touchdown.

Punting Duel

The 'punt was the best offensive and
defensive play that either team had.
In the first part of the game, due to
excellent panting on the part of Clark
and Ubl, the ball leersawed from one
end of the field to the other, It was
impossible for the safety man to at.
tempt to catch the ball, and as a re.
suit, on several occasions, it bounded
20 or so yards after hitting the
ground.
. The Pioneers had their greatest op-
portunity to score late in (he third
quarter, when Potts allowed Clark‘s
punt to slip through his hands. The
ball rolled from the Drake 40 yard
line to the nine yard line, and an the
first play after this break. Ubl missed
the ball with his foot when he at.
tempted to kick out of danger, but an
alert Drake man recovered and ,the
next punt rolled to the Grinn “Q7
yard line. , l‘

Subs Come to Randy

At various intervals during the
mud fight. both teams received sub.
stitutions, all of whom were irrime-
diately swamped by the mud-smeared,
dripping players, who used the clean
jerseys as towels. Before every play
it' was necessary for the center on the
offensive team to rub the slime from
the ball, but despite this precaution,

Preparatiom Started
for Gridiron Banquet

Plans are under way for the an.
nual Gridiron Banquet, according to
Paul Trigg, Chairman of the commit—
tee in charge. The. razz fest, which

'«is sponsored yearly by tho Grinncll

chapter of Sigma Delta Chi, will be
held the weekend of the Cornell game,
either on Nov, 23 or 24, Trigg said
yesterday. "‘

As in the past, a number of skits
will be presented between courses of
the banquet, in which campus charac-
ters and ulstoms will come in for
criticism,

it is hoped that the quadrangle din.
ing room can be procured for the din.
ner, but arrangements have not yet
been made.

A “rauvsheet” will again be a fea.
cure of the banquet and is already un-
der preparation. A number of new
features are under consideration, and
Trigg states that the skits will dilfer
considerably from those in the past.
They will be Shorter, he explained,
and a greater variety will be olfcrcd.

 

Council Extends

Probation Days
Hour of Closing

Changes in the plans for “hell week"
made at the meeting of the Council
of House Presidents Thursday night
include postponing the freshman cir.
cus, and extension of hours so that
the probation pcriod will end at 5
am. instead of at midnight, according
to Arnold Dickinson, secretary of the
group.

The freshman circus, which was
to have been staged between halves
of the Haskell indian—Grinnell foot.
ball game, has been postponed until
next spring. “Hell week" will end
at 6 am, on Sunday, instead of at
midnight Saturday as previously de.
cidcd, Dickinson said.

Edward Henningsen was appointed
to investigate the possibility of pro.
viding an ice skating rink on or near
the campus for use by students; and
it was decided to invite the building
associates to the Sunday evening
lunches which arc to be held in the
club rooms.

Cage Practice
Starts Monday

All Upperclassmen Eligible
for Fall Workouts

Daily basketball practice will begin
the Monday after the close of the
football schedule, Nov. 24, Coach .1.
C. 'l‘ruesdale announced yesterday.
However; prior to that time practice
will be held in the men's gymnasium
every Tuesday and Thursday at 2:30
p. m., and any upperclassmen may
report for practice at those times.

AfteF'Nov. 26, practices will be
limited to those who receive official
invitations to appear, and will be
held every afternoon. The 1934-35
cage season will be inaugurated on
Dec. 8 against the lowa State Teachers
quintet. '

Coach Truesdalc has asserted that
although there are seven letter men
back this year, the loss by graduation
of Captain Santi and Manns, the first
string guards of last year's squad, and
the lack of a tall man at the center
position, had to lessen the prospects
for a good season. He further re-
marked that the material from the
sophomore ranks cannot be relied up.
on for more than one or two reserves.

The seven letter men who are count.
ed on to carry the brunt of the bur-
den are Captain ' Mason, Frye, and
oliphant, all forwards; Bauer, Morgan,
and Phelpsucentel‘s; and Du Mont, a
guard. ' .

Gardner Talks
About English
School Routine

The fact, little-known on the cam.
pus, that Miss Evelyn Gardner, dean
of women, was ban-i and brought up
in England Came to light Thursday
evening as Miss Gardner addressed
a meeting of the Young Women’s
christian association,

The revelation Dccul'ed during her
talk on "Life in an English College."
she quoted from a letter written by
her cousin; Miss Winifred Curtis,’ who
is a instructor in the Cambridge
Trai mg college, Cambridge, England.
‘Tea and conservatism were revealed
as two of the fundamental character.
istics of the English school. At break-
fast and dinner, the women were ex—
pected to serve themselves, Miss
Gardner explained, and each was as.
signed an individual “serviette ring.”

Signing of various books preceded
every meal, the signature serving for
every purpose hcm requesting rescr.
vations for afternoon -tea to obtaining
permission to go out in the evening
after diner. In the latter case. the
students were requested to say where
they were going and when they plan—
ned to return—which in no case was
to be later than 11 p. in.

Sports play a comparatively small
part in the school life of the English
woman, according lp Miss Gardner.
However, the Cambridge school is pro.
vided with two tennis courts, a “net.
ball" court and a hockey field,

A detailed account of the daily
program of girls in, the school was
presented by Miss Gardner, who drew
up a comparison with customs in this

country.
