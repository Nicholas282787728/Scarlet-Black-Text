Many . Talented Performers

Found on Prep Squad

Early indications that' this year's
prep tootball squad is the best to
be assembled hero in a number oi
scasons were seen Tuesday by
John Truesdale, freshman football
coach. The preps have exhibited re—
markably high ability in fundamentals,
especially blocking and tackling, in
early drills, Trucsdale said, in addition
to holding a big advantage over squads
of previous years in size and weight,

A number of good kickers have been
uncovered, outstanding among whom
are John Hayward, allestate end tnom
Davenport, and William Lounsberry,
Cole's versatile hack and tackle. Other
members oi the kicking squad have
shown up well, and are coming along
rapidly with training and practice.
'l‘ruesdale stated. in addition, several
good center prospects have been dis—
covered, out of which it is entirely
likely that a good big pivot man will
be developed for tuture varsity com-
petition.

One serious loss has marred prce
liminary drills. George Payne, former
Omaha star and a‘ll—city player there,
suffered a recurrence oi an old high
school injury last week and will
drop prep football to get himselt in
shape tor next year’s varsity. Payne
had showed exceptional ability in
early workouts.

Plans for the rest of the week as
announced Tuesday consist of work
on blocking and tackling through the
use oi a few simple plays trom punt
tormation.

No schedule has as yet been arrange
ed, but several games will be carded
as a season wind—up, Whether these
games are scheduled or not will doc
pend entirely on participation in
practice, Truesdale said.

Tufts President Suggests
New ‘Design for Living’

TUF'I‘S COLLEGE, Mass. Oct lm
A “code” to embrace ideals oi the last
generation and to provide tor the
shortcomings ot education was sug—
gested this week as a ”design for liv-
ing" [or college students by Dr. John
A. Cousens, president of Tufts col—
lege.

“Our System of education does not
furnish the young man or woman
emerging from it with a code to live
by,” he said.

“If we were summoned now before
the bar of judgement, we should have
to admit the charge that our system
of education does not fumlsh a phil-
osophy oi life, does not supply a
set of principles which constitute the
basic design of life’s unfolding pat»
tor-n."

The drought had its eflect on
educational activities of the states
which suiicrcd this summer. in Cote
orado, Utah, Nebraska, and Oklahoma
terms and courses have been curtailed
awaiting Federal aid.
