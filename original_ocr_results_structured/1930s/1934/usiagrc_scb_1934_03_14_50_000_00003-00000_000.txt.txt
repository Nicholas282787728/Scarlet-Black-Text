the ship's boats, which had been iig—
ged with a small mast and squares
sail. We had a rough passage over,
and two of us had to bail all the

scoop aft, and the experience gave
me an excellent idea of the Ledious~
ness of the taslr which had occupied
Bligh and his men during their 41-
day voyage to Timur, in the Bounty‘s
launch.” (Here he refers to “Mutiny
on the Bounty," one of the year's
best sellers, of which he was the co-
author.)
Reported Drowned

After arriving at Mangareva, "a
'primitive littlc placc, rarely visited
by trading schooners and with no
wireless station," the party was torus
ed to spend five weeks waiting for
some means of getting home. The
party finally reached the island of
Hao, in the Low Archipelago, 400
miles away, and from there the re»
maining 500 miles were made in a

. ton cutter.

Upon arriving at his home in Tahi—
ti, Hall found that a ieport had been
circulated to the effect that he had
drowned, and his daughter, Sarah,
was the only member of the family,
who for about three weeks, had not
given up hope for his return.

During the war, Hall was an army
pilot and was several times reported
lost or taken captive by the enemy.
