HAPPY DAYS!

A rousing chorus of Happy Days are Here
Again” would be in vely good order on the Grin-
nell College campus this weekend. With final
registration figures not yet available, and' increase
of almost 00 per cent in the number of new stud~
ants is assured—a truly remarkable record and

one which few if any other colleges in the middle
west can approach.

Following the debacle of 1929, Giinell was
one of the last schools to show a decrease in at-
tendance. In fact, no serious loss in enrollment
was experienced until last year, when the figure
fell below that of 1933 by almost 130 students
That Grinnell has, in a single year, regained pracs
tically as many students lost in 933, speaks loudly

in praise of the popularity and drawing power
of the college.

But while the reputation of Glinncll wa'n
undoubtedly a basic influence behind the surpris—
ing eninollinent at least three other factors played
a big part First, the trustees agreed last winter
to lower the student charges to a blanket fee of
$620, a sum very appreciably less than the previous

minimum charge for a year, though the educa- _

tional standards of the college remain at their
former high level Secondly, credit is due the
public relations department for its excellent and
vel y effective field work duling the past year.
Finally, the New Deal should be thanked for the
SRE aid which has made it possible for more than
sixty-five students to attend Grinnell, who could
not have done so otherwise.

And while counting its blessings, these days,
Grinnell college, especially as personified by the
coaching staff, can smile complacently as it eyes
the large and ybrawny squad of freshman gridiron
aspilants. Happy days are here again!

G—

GREETINGS FRESHMEN.

By this time you have been welcomed to
Grinnell by the administration, the faculty, and
the officers of the various halls and cottages and
should be convinced of the sincerity of their wel-
come. Likewise, you have been advised by the
administration, faculty, and house officers and no
doubt fcel capable of meeting any situation.

However, as the representative of the entire
student body, The Scarlet and Black hereby adds
its greetings to those you have already received,
and wishes to exercise the prerogative of adding a
bit of advice.

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Before the year is up each of you will be, as
president Nollen asserted at convocation, irrevocr
ably a “~."Giinnellian Whethcr completion oi the
process requires days, weeks, or months is up to
you.

Everyone has been telling you what to do
and how to act. We suggest only this, be friendly,
Speak to everyone, student and professor alike;
and don’t wait for the other fcllow to speak first,
It is so very easy to misconstrue a vacant stare
prompted by shyness as an act of snobbishness,
w ereas a fliendly greeting is always appreciated.

Grinncll is a friendly college and will make
you fool at home in no time if you givc it a chance,

G
GIVE CHAPEL A CHANCE

Next week Grinncll college will have its first
opportunity to pass judgment on the new chapel
programs

The services will differ greatly from those in
the past and should be whole-heartedly supported
by the students, tor whose benefit the changes
were made.

Under the new plan, by which one speaker will
have charge of the first {our services each week,
topics can be developed to a greater extent than
formerly and many interesting talks should be
presented. The brevity of the program is another
feature.

The new series cannot possibly be a success,
however, if it receives no better suport than the
programs have in the past' but the chapel services
and Friday morning assemblies can become of
very genuine value to Grinnell it the students will
give them a chance Why not attend en masse
next week and give the new plan a real trial?

G
KNOW YOUR FOOTBALL?

How many football fans can tell where the
wing back- plays' what constitutes holding; the
diiicrcnce between a safety and a touchback:
when the backfield is illegally in motion? Very
few, decided the Drake athletic department. Bee
lievlng that Mr. John Public would like to know
more oi the technical side of the gridiron sport.
they held a free football show last Tuesday, with
the Drake varsity and prep squads as the actors,
to answer the many questions that annually per—
plcx the average fotball fan concerning rules,
gridiron tei ms and the duties of the players in the
different positions.

That football crowds are eager to get the
low down on what happens on the gridiron was
made apparent by the record throng of over
18,000 persons who crammed the Drake stadium
to Witness the demonstration.

Would a similar show for the benefit of
Pioneer grid fans meet with the safe enthusiastic
response? According to Lester Watt, head foote

ball coach, a demonstration of this sort might be ,

planned for the near future if Sufficient interest is
expressed. If you would be interested in such an
exhibition, slip a note to this enect into The Scar-
let and Black ,box between the Alumni Recitation
hall and he library.

AN EXPERIMENT IN EDUCATION
(Daily Iowan)

Fenn college in Cleveland—famed for its experiments
in helpeyoursolieto—education schemes —anounced not
long ago that it was embarking on a novel program de»
signed to give liberal arts students a chance to apply
first-hand the theories and facts presented in the class»
room.

The idea is to produce "citizens” rather than mere
graduates, and commends itself to the serious consider—
ation of educators.

Students will not be required to learn economics. '

zoolugy, government, history, languages, and other
branches of knowledge in unrelated courses, but will
combine all these in the solution oi a practical problem
in citizenship, “The city of Cleveland as a laboratory in

citizenship" has been chosen for the first year's problem, .

Students will make fiﬁtrhand investigation into the oper-
aticn of the city government, social agencies, churches,
business, and all other phases oi community life.
