Dammit Doesn’t
Live Here

Any More

We more will a small brown and
white pooch answer the call, “Come
lrerc, Dammit!” in Smith hall.

For Dammit is dead. The policc-l
men shot him Monday,

The dog, acquired by the hall a
month or so ago, and who would
answer only to the above call, was
let out into the cold world to shift‘
for himself over the Christmas hells
days, When the hall residents res
turned, he was waiting outside the
door.

But he was a different dog. He
snifflcd and lay all the day long in
a stupor. Worm medicine and case
tor oil failed to arouse him. Finally,
one Fred Kerr, with a feeling of kin-
ship far the sufferer, took him to a
veterinarian. Distemper, said the
vet.

There was but one thing to do and
the police were known to have the
facilities. There was no one in the
police station, but Kerr tied a note to
Dammit‘s neck. "I have distemper.
Pleasc shoot," said the note.

And the policemen, believing
signs, did that thing.

Glillllell’s string quartet will again
at Horrick chapel

The Grinricll string quartet has
appeared before Gi-iuncll studcnts
regularly for nearly 25 years, and in
that time has played programs of
great interest.

In the program next Tuesday, the
group will be assisted by Sarah Inc
ncss MacDonald and Chester VVllrl
liams.

litiydu Cciiiposilion

Thc quartet will offer as its first
number on the program, one of
Haydri's quartets, opus 76, number 1

a Dubois quintet in a seldom heard
combination of instruments: oboe,
violin, viola, ’Cello and piano, The
Dubois quintet is in four movements.

The "American Quartet” for-
strings by Dvorak will also be heard
on this program.

“Most Enjoyable"

“Chamber music is undoubtedly
the highest form of musical compor
sltion, but at the same time, probab-
ly the most enjoyable to listen to,
and because of its clarity, the most
readily understood," dcclarod David
E. Peck, chairman of the depart-
ment of music, yesterday.

The Grinnell string quartet has of—
fered college students an opportunity‘
to become acquainted with good muAl
sical literature, and it is hoped that
many wil take advantage of this and
other musical organizations of Grill:

Pioneer Team

Set for Hard
Tilt Saturday

Creighton Has Clear Slate; .
Phelps Returns to School

Following Illness

A battle bctwccn a Pioneer team
which has demonstratcd that it is
capsul'e of working fast, tricky
plays, and a high-scoring ‘Crcighton
outfit which will have the advan-
tage of height, will entertain basket-
ball fans here Saturday evening in
the first Missouri Vollcy game to be
played on tho Crinnoll floor,

The undefeated Creighton 'five
will depend on its two 6 foot 8 inch
players, Schmidt and ware, and its
deadreye forward, Englcbrctson, who
has been good for seven or eight
field goals in each game played so
far this season by the Bluejays,

Dciironstratc Power

Grinnell cagers demonstrated their
power, even though disorganized, in
defeating Washington last Saturday,
and if their attack functions smooth-
ly this week should give the visitors
a run for their money.

It is possible that Dick Phelps,
veteran center, who returned to
Grinnell from his home this week af-
ter suffering from lymphatic infecA
tion, will not be able 1.0 play Saturv
day. However, Julius Bauer and
Bob Morgan gave good accounts of
themselves last week and thc cen-
ter position will be taken care of in
good shape,‘ although Schmidt wiu
have the height advantage for tip-
offs. ‘,

Will Depend on Defense

Grinnell's chances to defeat the
Bluejays for the first time in basket
ball after 11 straight defeats by
Creighton cagers, will also depend
upon a well functioning defense.
Capt Gaston Santi last year was the
only guard in the conference to hold
down “Cornie” Collin, sensational
Creighton forward, and may be de-
pended on this year, 'together with
Les Manns, to discourage Englcbret-
son as much as possiblé.

Mickey Frye starred defensively
for Grinnell at St. Louis last weex
and Julius Bauer demonstrated his
scoring abilities for the first time,

Workouts this week have stressed
the polishing of plays.

Debate Club to Entertain
Newt-on High School Team

Grinncll debaters took the low end
of a 32-17 vote from listeners who

Dec, 28 AmeSvGrinnell debate on in—
flation, It is possible that all votes
have not been received, however.

The Grinriell debate club will be
host tonight at 7:30 o'clock in room
117 of Alumni Recitation hall to the
Newton high school debate team, and
its coach, Joseph Griffin. Two men
from the Newton school will debate
against William Brown and Ray—
mond Stipe on the question of radio
control. Grinncll will take the life
fil'matlve stand.

The complete debate schedule will
be announced in the near future.
Most of thc inter-collegiate debates
will take place during the month or
February, according to Edson E, Al-
tlcson, director of debate.
