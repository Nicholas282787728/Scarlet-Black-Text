Perhaps the most important point of the year's

Now, however, there is an added drive to illoloasc
Grilinell’s enrollment and it is probable that next.
fall will tell the tale of returning prosperity to the
campus.

The year’s most important sports event from
the thinned standpoint was the capture of. the
National Intel-college two-mile championship in;
Myron “Mike” Pilhrow. Mike did not receive a
great deal of lmllylloo for his victory. because it
occurred during the summer when the sports pages

TWO EXTREMES

Printed elsewhere ill this 'ssiic is :l letter in
response to the colliinuiiic tioii of u Des )loiilcs
alumnus dealing witll Grinncll‘s athletic pol' y,
which zippezlvod iii the Doc. lti issue oi" Tho Smlrlet
and Block. The latter suggested that it certain
number of athletic scholarships be granted allllll‘dlr
ly and that some provision be llilltlll to giro fur-
ther aid to dcsorl'ilig‘ athletes of I‘cnsontlllly high

holastio standing. The writer of the sl‘cond let-
ter has apparently mi interpreted this suggestion
to mean the open sullsidi ing‘ of iltllletcs. llo ' ,r,
Grillncll can at the pi llt do lunch toward aiding
its athletes witl out stooping to Slll)§ltll"lll0l1. In
fact, the ildlllili tration has been so ai 'lOtlS to
eyade overwnphusis of sports that it has colllt‘, (lml-
gel‘ously closc to the point of ignoring the llllptil‘r
lance of athletics to the welfarl' ol‘ the collcgr.

FAILURE OF DUTCH DATES
(The California Daily)

That women should pay half the expenses of a date
is the contention of Miss Susan M. Guild, clean of woe
men at Washburn college. Women students usually
have more money to spend than men, she says, and
Should therefore pay their own way to all campus
dances and entertainments,

The question of “dutch treating" by women raged at
universities throughout the United States Snvcl‘al years
ago when the effects of the depression were [list fcltv

Cereds all over the country promised to pay half of
all dates that they had with collcgc lnen. Buvafter the
full glare of publicity had been turned on the move-
ment, it soon fizzlcd and died out completely.

It was doomed from tli’e start. Careds agreed Llizit
“dutch treating” was a fine thing and that it was the
only fan and right. thing to do, but they seldom, if ever,
lived up to the agreements of the code,

Men, too, historic and natural protectors of the
weaker scx, fcit their dignity hurt when the woman
took four-bits out of hcr pulse in the theater foyer and
paid hor own way.

The big trouble was, however, that the women did
not always get her their money’s worth. If the woman

Editor, The Scarlet and Black,
Dear Sll‘:

I have read the letter of Maxwell
Ross published in Tile Scarlet and,
Black on December In and I taire
exception to much that he said.

Athletic victories, he declares,
must be secured; and the publlcre—
lotions department must make a
more concentrated effort to bring in
good high school athletes.

My opposition to such a proposal
is based on the ballet that Grinnell
college, after all, is an educational
institution and that it should try to
continue as such without resorting
to the shameful expedient of using
its scholarship funds to gain such
prestige as athletic success can
bring In short, it the life of this
institution depends upon athletic
victories which can be gained only
by hiring athletes to play for us, it
were better that the institution the
an honorable death.

I am in favor of the department
of public relations and the use of
scholarships to attract students to
Grinnell, but always aid should be
given to those who are primarily
good students or incidentally at!»
letcs rather than to those who are
athletes alone.

The subsidizing of athletes on a
large scale would do more to ruin
Grirmell's reputation than could her
lack of athletic victories. May the
day never come when Grinnell is
known primarily as an athletic in-
stitution. Endowments secured by
an means would he purchased at
far too great a price. '

The purpose of athletics is not to
win victories. The purpose of ath—
ietics is bodily exercise and sport
tor the maximum number of pe -
sous, not for a few hired parti
pants. Above all, it is not. the pu
pose of athletics to gain financial
backing for the school,

Too often in the past our assisted
athletes have been a discredit to the
college.

Sincerely yours,

Dave Singer

Graduate Jobless Present
American Society Menace

{Spccial to The semltl and one»)
New York 7 Thousands of job-
less recent graduates of schools,
colleges and universities are becom-
ing a menace to the present order of
American society because of the di
content rife among them, in the opin-
ion of Col. H. Edmond Bullis, execu-
tive secretary of the National Com-
mittee for Mental Hygiene,

For this he blames partly the
schools and colleges which turned
them out.

“Many schools," he holds, “fail to
equip their' graduates for leisure, or
for a state of affairs in which, thrown
upon their own resources. they may
be compelled to create their own ac-
tivitles,”
