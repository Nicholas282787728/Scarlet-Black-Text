THE TOBACCO
DOES NOT SPILL OUT

Good tobaccos. ..rerll good tobaccos. . . that’s the reason
for Lucky Strike’s ﬁne, smooth quality. We use only
the center leaves of the ﬁnest Turkish and domestic to-
bacco plants. Not the top leaves—because those are under-
developed. Not the bottom leaves—because those are in-

ferior in quality. “75 use only the center leaves—because
these are the mildest leaves—fully ripe for perfect smok-
ing. Only these choice tobaccos are used tomake Luckies
—50 round, so ﬁrm, so fully packed—and no loose ends
to spill out That’s Why Luckies are always mild and
smooth. That’s why always “Luckies please”. And don’t
forget.“lt‘ s toasted”—for throat protection—for ﬁner taste.
