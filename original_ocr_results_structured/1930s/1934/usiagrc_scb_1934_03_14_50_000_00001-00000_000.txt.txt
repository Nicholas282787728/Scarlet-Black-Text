Theological Seminary Head
Stresses Need' for Church

"There is still a real need for the
church in our lives, just as there has
been in the past,” declared President
Albert W. Palmer, of the Chicago
Theological seminary at a joint meet-

It may perform this task through its
position as a social unit. and in nu-
mercills other ways.

Puturc possib cs for ministers,
and opportunities for future contribr
utions of the church to society, were
discussed by Dr. Palmer. He also dc-
scribed the work done by his their
logical students in Chicago

Battles With Tossing Seas;
Diet of Comanuts,
Fish Endured

A shipwreck in which James Nora
man Hall, '10, author, traveler and
adventurer, figured, is related in a.
recent copy of The Colfax Tribune,
which quotes a letter which the Crin-
nell alumnus wrote from his south
sea island home in Tahiti to his
mother, Mrs. A. w. Hall, in Colfax.

Hall, it secms, had been voyaging
with a party on a small schooner,
Pro Patric. The group had visited the
island of Pitcairn, famous for its
mutineers. and was hcadihg back for
Tahiti, when the schooner struck a
reef off an uninhabited island.

Schooner on Poorf

“It was a pitch-black night,” says

the letter, "with wind and rain, and

there was a great sea on the reef.

For it While it looked very bad inc
deed . . . .

"The old schooner, which was being
bashed cruelly against the reef, with

lbig seas breaking over her and us,
,was finally thrown, broadside on, up
‘on the reef: and there she stuck:
And we stock to her, holding on to
whatever was handy to kecp us from
‘being washed around too much. At
-last we all got off in the ship’s boats,
and felt our way through the dark-
ness to solid ground. and oh, how
deliciously solid it felt! Everyone
{was saved, although, later, a native
-boy was drowned. He was our only
casualty."
Cocoanuts, Fish

After making their way to the unr
inhabited island, Tunoe, “a beautiful
little coral island. about three miles
long and two and a half broad, with
small islands threaded all around the
rcef, and with a beautiful lagoon in—
sidc, the men made a camp, using
sails and awnings, taken off the ship
when the sea wcnt down, for tents.
“I had a delightful time exploring
Timoc, and with cocoanuts and an
abundance of fish, we had plenty to
eat," Hall writes.

"We remained on Time for nearly
a week: then 16 of us sailed over to

Thorough Comprehension of Subject
Aim of New Examinations--Conard

Acting Dean of Faculty
Explains Regulations

of Test System

“IL is not the purpose of compre»
hensive examinations to inform the
professor of what the student knows
or docsn't know," Prof. Henry s. Con-
ard. acting dean of the faculty. said
yesterday in explanation of the new
system of comprehensive tests that
will be given every senior in his ma»
jor subject at the end of the school
year.

Emphasizing that the true purpose
of the tests is to show the student
how fine a piece of work he can do,
Mr. Conard pointcd out that the
new system stimulates interest in the
subject beyond a mere classroom
knowledge and thus makes college
life vastly richer.

Choice of Majors

The examinations will be given in
three-hour periods on three successive
days. Every candidate for a degree
from now on must take the tests, ex-
cept students who have already fin-
ished their work for the present year
and are not in residence this semes-
ter. Seniors who have more than one
major may choose the major subject
in which they wish to be tested.

No senior will be required to take
examinations in any other subject if
his standing at the end of the semes-
ter is high enough to warrant a pass<
ing grade in that subject.

Laboratory Problems

Due to the present experimental
stage of the examination system,
few general rules have been made.
the content of the tests being left
largely to the beads of departments.
In courses in which laboratory work

Critic Praises
Band Concert

Woodwind Section Receives

Favorable Comment

By H. w. MATLACK
Under the direction of Chester Wil-
liams, instructor in wind instrument .
the Grihnell college concert hand of-
fered a program of music for the
band of a distinctly higher type than
bands usually perform, and got away
with it so well that the time seems in
sight when the band will assume a
place in our musical life comparable
to the glee clubs and the orchestra.

One thing the band has to contend
with which these organizations have
overcome is irregularity in attend-
ance at rehearsals. When members
of the band take the same inflexible
attitude toward thcir work as do
members of the glee clubs, improve-
ment in the band will be tremendous-
ly speeded up. '

Music by the great mastcr of mu-
sicians, Johann Sebastian Each, has
been frequent enough in violin, piano,
orchestral, and organ programs, and
has lately become even a striking
feature of sponsored advertising- on
thc radio, but Bach music for the
band is a real novelty. Bach's pro-
clivity for polyphony, which is the
type of musical structure to which
bands ale the least adapted, makes
arrangement of his music for the
band hard to manage. Nevertheless
the experiment, by on unknown or-
ranger, was highly successful, and
the performance interesting.

Marches and typical band music
give Williams and his players plenty
of opportunity for snappy rhythm.
and pieces of this char-actor were
contrasted with gentlcr music so that
both appeared to their best advan-
tage. Thc woodwind section seems
to be particularly good this season.
The program was well-proportioned
in length and balance, and showcd
that the college band could play rcal
music as well as raise the roof at
basketball games.

is required, one of the three parts of
the test will probably be devoted to
laboratory problems, Mr. Conard said.

”Catch” questions are opposed to
the purpose of the comprehensive
examination, according to Dr. Cone
ard. Both the student and the instruc-
tor should work together to carry
out a prearranged plan, without
hunting for “new wrinkles.”

Used Elsewhere

Comprehensive examination sys»
terns are already being used in sev-
eral colleges and universities through—
out the country. Essentially a British
plan, the tests are now given at Har-
vard, Wellesly, the University of Chi-
cago, Haverford, and Swarthmore.

The results of the new system have
been twofold, Dr. Conard said. “It has
grcatly improved teaching, by make
ing clear to the staff the essentials
of the job. and has proved to be a
great stimulus to the student who
really means business."

A statement of the purpose of the
comprehensive examinations as given
at Harvard is found in a reprint of a

Blanket Charge

Details Given

Room Prices Similar Except

for Few in Basements

An increased interest in Crinnell
college has been noticed among high
school students by the workers of the
public rclaticns department as a re
sult of the announcing of the blan-
kct fee which will go into effect next

associate in public relations.

Under the new blanket charge, the
rooms in the men's dormitories will
all necessarily be charged for at the
same rate, except for a few in the
basements of Dibble, Clark, and Raw-
lson. The method of allotting rooms
will be up to the Council of House
Presidents, which organization is to
take action on this question probably
at the regular meeting tomorrow,

Whereas the rooms in the dorm

tones were previously rented for
varying rates, according to their
size and location, the living quarters
in the women's quadrangle have been
allotted by means of drawing, so that
the new blanket fee ruling will make
no change in the precedure there.
I Students who live in town or rent
rooms outside of the college housing
system will pay the old tuition of
$250, which, however, will include
laboratory fccs. These students will
be required to pay the fee for the
semester booklet, to pay housc dues.
and to buy their books, as before.

For Liberal Arts students the blah.
ket charge will be $620 for two se-
mesters, including tuition, ~ room,
board, hospital insurance, social fecs,
laboratory fees, room laundry, and
the semester fee. The blanket fee for
students majoring or minor-ing in
music or working toward a bachelor
of music degree, will be $550.
