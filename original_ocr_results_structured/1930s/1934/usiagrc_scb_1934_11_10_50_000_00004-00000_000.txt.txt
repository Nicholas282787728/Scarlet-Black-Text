Canard, Pooley

Discuss Parley
at Friday Chapel

Explanations of the history and
purpose of the International Relations
conference to bc held here next Friday,
Saturday, and Sunday were given be-
fore the weekly student assembly Eri—
day. The talks wcre given by Joseph
Conard and Richard Pooley, confer.
enco chairman and hcad cf the speak.
ers committee respectively.

“The purpose of the international
Relations conference is to further the
study of the problems of international
relations," declared Conard. The con.
fcrcncc, hc oxplaincd, was organized
for the ﬁrst time three years ago
Since then it has steadily grown and
now is an important event on the
Grrnncll campus,

“While we do not expect as large
an attendance as thcre was at the
conierence last spring, shit we ox—
pect to have a very satisfactory at-
tendance judging from the favorable
replies we have received from schools
all over the middle west," Conard
stated.

“'l‘hs: lntomational Relations meet—
ing is not a proproganda conference,"
declared Richard Pooley in answering
some of the unvoiced questions in re—
gard to the purpose of the conference
"Instead it is an attempt to study the
problems of international relations.”

Both of the Speakers gave brief rc.
sumcs of the careers of the men who
are speaking on the conference pro»
gram and urged that all students at—
tend the mectings.

Book Arouscd Interest

“I first became interested in astro—
nomy three years ago," Singer volun—
teered, "I had read a book entitled
”The Ways of the Planets’ and some
how or other I became interested in
the subject. I have re-lread the book
since then, but I still can not tell what
there was in it that attracted me to
this hobby. Anyway I suddenly
found the subject very fascinating.”

Telescopes are expensive things,
Singcr explained, in answer to a query
regarding the cost of the manufacturr
ed instruments. “For example," he
declared, “I spent $4.53 on the six
inch telescope which l constructed
last summer, while, if I had purchas—
ed a similar instrument, it would have
cost. $100 or more and then would on.
ly have been a cheap affair.

Plans Large-r Telescope

“Sometime in the future when I
have the time and. money I am going
to make a 12inch telescope, but that
time is in the rather distant future,"
Singer admitted.

The construction of a telescope is
one of the most fascinating parts of
astronomy. the amateur star.gazer cle-

ecially the grinding of the lens, but
even that part of the task has ii; in.
