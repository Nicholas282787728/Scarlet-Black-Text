AN UNJUST RULE
The recent protest of Gates ball against Clark
for playing in an intramural speedball game a man
who had refused an invitation to particr
pate in varsity football rather lays the intramural
rule involved, open to criticism. The infel‘rence

of the intramural regulation is, that if a man
whom the coaching staff considers capable enough
for varsity competition refuses to compete he
should be punished by denial of participation in
interchall sports.

Of course the rule states that the ineligibility
lasts only during the season of the varsity sport
in question, but that is beside the point. It all
amounts to coercing an athlete to report for var--
sity competition, regardless of whether or not
he has justification for refusal to do so.

In the controversy referred to, the man
whose participation was protested is engaging in
so much outside work that for him to report for
varsity football would be very unwise. On the
other hand, members of the protesting hall were
rightly disgruntled since they were unable to use
two residents of their hall because of the same
rule. and had been observing the regulation.
These two men, in turn, had dropped varsity
football at the suggestion of their parents. Both
excuses seem adequate, and it certainly seems
unfair that the three men, and others in their
position, should be denied the pleasure of intrar
mural competition through no fault of their own.

The whole spirit of college athletic competi-
tion is overlooked when men are forced, in any
way or to any extent, to engage in varsity com.
petition. If men, who would be of real value
to one of the varsity teams, refuse to report and
can offer no satisfactory excuse for their stand,
the rule might appropriately be applied. On the

other hand, any who are obviously justified in
their refusal of an invitation to participate in
varsity athletics should certainly not be pro.
hibited from enjoying intei'»dorm competition.

SAVE THE STATES!

The tumultuous conflict over the New Deal
which the current election has stirred up causes
one to wonder why such a great undertaking was
ever attempted by the national government. Why
was it necessary for the federal government to
inaugurate and carry out measures for recovery?
How is it going to be possible for the government
to perform this task succcssfully when many
parts of the country have entirely different
phases of the depression to overcome, and relief
and recovery measures must be suited to different
localities?

The leadership which the national govern»
inent has come to possess was pr ed upon it
The government should not be cr ized for as-
suming extraordinary powers in the promotion of
national recove' It could not do otherwise
without being c cized for inaction.

For years there has been a growing dissatis-
faction with the part which the states have played
in our social, political, and economic life. They
have either let the pressing problems alone, or
they have tried, and still are trying unsound
remedies and insufficiently-considered experi-
ments which bring confusion on the industry of
the Country by contradicting and offsetting each
other. Being a practical people, We have attempts
ed to offset this difficulty by turning hastily to
the federal government with pleas for the solu~
tion of our problems.

We have become dissatisfied with the char—
acter of our state governments. “We have been
unable to give enough time or thought to the
selection of the many candidates for office, so
that this selection has fallen to those who from
one motive or another make a business of it,
These are the political bosses and managers. Al.
election time it is either one set of appointees or
another that gets into office. Thus many unfit
persons obtain political positions and sadly mis.
use their public offices. It is this which has so
seriously impaired our confidence in state gov—
ernment and has caused us to tum to the federal
government as a more reliable and efficient
means to handle and settle our problems,

It would seriously undermine the country’s
political vitality to give over to national author»
ity powers and functions which have previously
been held by the states. In the United States it
has been the privilege of independent local
opinion and individual conviction which has given
speed and solidarity to the processes of our eco»
nomic and political growth. Centralization can
be carried on only at the expense of the self de—
pendency and the efficiency of the many com—
munities of which the nation is made up. To turn
over to the national government problems which
have, through our own lack of interest or effort,
failed to be solved, will deprive the federal struc»
ture as a whole of its life and its power to one
dure.

It would be dangerously unwise to substitute
abolition of the state governments for reform.
Corruption and inefficiency can not be wiped
out by more centralization. The state govern-
ments must be simplified, purified, and reorganiz»
ed, for the remedy for their evils lies not out
side the states but Within them,

If we cannot adjust the local institutions of
our federal setup to changing conditions, and
maintain them in such a manner that they will
be able to exercise their powers and fulfill their
functions, we have failed as constitutional states~
men.

The United states Law Review is
a monthly magazine that seems to
have caught the spirit of the Ameri.

events. which it calls a digest, is so
typically from the legal point of vicw

give the embryo lawyer a prophetic

truth and a courageous independence
of thought are the attributes of a
first class mind, he explained in can.
tinuing.

”Intelligence minus moral character
means disaster," Brown stated in ref-
orcnce to the third item which he
had mentioned.

Social responsiveness was listed by
the speaker as his fourth wish for
today's students. There is a great
need for people who are socially re.
sponsive to replace the social pirates
and the indifferent who have long
dominated, he continued.

“Lastly, we covet for you a cour-
ageous attitude toward God,“ he de-
clared, concluding with the hope that
the coming generation will neither
‘laugh at nor merely “endure" the
universe, but rather will have a cour—
ageous trust in it.

Attacking conditions under which
we choose the least able and the least
worthy to govern us, the Rev. Mr.
Hubert. C. Herring of New York City,
pied for a more intelligent interest in
affairs of government in his address
at the all—college convocation this
morning.

The Rev. Mr. Herring, secretary of
the Congregational Department of
Social Relations, and (lo—author of “The
Church and Social Relations," spoke
on the subject, “How We Crown Our
Kings."

"You and I are under indictment if
they go to the chair," the Rev. Mr.
Herring charged in referring to the
Scottsbom negroes who were convicted
on “trumped—up charges of a crime
they never committeed, or at least for
which they have never been justly
convicted, We should change our
,kings so that such injustice is impos—
sible."

“America is split into warring
camps," he declared while discussing
race relationships with negroes, orien.
‘tals, Mexicans, and Jews in this coun—
try. “Between these youps the
chasm deepens,"

which brought about the appointment
of Dwight Morrow as Ambassador to

“A new kind of freedom" in the

concluded.
