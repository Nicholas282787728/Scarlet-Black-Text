Pan-America

Should Profit
by New Deal

Herring Predicts Friendlier
Relations as Result
of New Attitude

New hopes for Pan»Alnericanism as
a result of the New Deal were ex.
pressed by Dr. Hubert c. Herring at
an all—college convocation in Herrick
chapel Monday morning during his
descripl'e lecture on Latin America
in which he attacked the United
States’ policy of paternalism toward
the score of countries south of her.

Personal credit for more friendly re-
lations with Latin America was given
Secretary of State Cordell Hull, “un.
obtrusive, shy, and retiring,” whose
fratemalism displaced the traditional
haughuness ol American statesmen
toward the sensitive smaller nations,
and whose announcement of a policy
of non-intervention was declared to
have achieved success for the seventh
PamAmerical-i congress, held last Dec—
ember.

Bolivar‘s Dream

"Pan.Amei-icanism originally was
Simon Bolivar's dream of a New
World federation which would build
up a zone of sanity in inmmational
relations," Dr. Herring declared. Failm
ure of his dream was attributed to the
quarrelsomeriess of the Latin states,
and the expansion and “self-conscious
superiority" of the United States.

Later, Dr. Herring continued, Pan-
Americanism became “James G,
Elaine’s answer to the prayer for
more trade,” and the mistrust that
follows exploitation and a “godfather
attitude” so alienated the smaller na.
tions “that the first six Pan-American
conferences accomplished practically
nothing except agreeing m “
college catalogs, regulate the size of
postage stamps, and plan a memorial
lighthouse for Columbus."

Threatening Attitude

The development of the Monroe
Doctrine into an “if you don't behave.
we’ll make you behave” doctrine al-
so was attacked by Dr. Herring.

Under the cover of "a lot of face.
washing expeditions,” we have “made
the Haitians build roads for our own
military forces to travel on” and have
“taught the poor, ignorant Nicaraguans
how to conduct honest elections," he
charged.

Church Official

A travel talk briefly describing each
of the 2D Latin-American countries
preceded the remarks on PamAmeri.
can relations.

Dr. Herring is secretary of the Con-
gregational department of social re-
lations, director of a seminar held an.
nually in Mexico and the Caribbean
countries, and an executive director
of the commission on cultural rela-
tions with Latin America. He at-
tended the seventh Pan—American con.
ference in Montevideo, Uruguay, last
year.

hospital, will speak to the men of the

failed to cross the finish line.

The advisability of continuing water

discussed at the meeting, but it was
decided that the matter be submitted
to the halls for their reaction before
definite action is taken.

May Add Volley Ball

The fact that real wafer polo can

the points brought up in favor of
dropping the sport, according to intro.

“Wc have always had an epidemic
of colds and sickness during the time
water polo was being played," he
said, “but whether it was caused by
playing water polo, or was merely
coincident with it, we don't know.”

The board also considered a sug»

Missouri Valley
Officials to Name
Loop Champions

The Missouri Valley quarrel over
the 1934 football championship will
be settled this Saturday when officials
of the seven conference schools gath.
er at Kansas City, Mo., for their an-
nual winter meeting.

Creighton and Washington are con.
ceded to have the best claim on Lhe
title, but Drake is also making a bid
for the mythical honor, The Bears
walloped the Bulldogs 20 to 0 in their
only Valley tilt, having a record of
100ml the schools which played a
regular conference schedule, the Blue.
jays had the best percentage with two
wins and a single loss.

It is expected that Washington’s
claim will be thrown out because of its
short loop schedule. On the basis of
this. Drake claims that is defeat at
the hands of the Bears should not be
counted in selecting the new champion,
If this were done the Bulldogs, who
had ii .500 record in Valley competi-
tion, could boast the same per cent
as CreightoHAone of their wins being
over the Jays.

Grinncll will be represented at the
conference meeting by John c. Trues-
dale, athletic director, and Earl D.
Strong, chairman of the faculty com.
mince on athletics.

Trio of Activities Added

Three activities have been addcd to

cation department, according lo Miss
Clara Andersen, head of the depart.
ment. The activities recently ilill'o-
duccd are a class in fencing, a “gym"
class for women of the faculty circle.
and badminton competition,

The fencing class, which meets on
Monday and Wednesday afternoons at
4.30 o’clock, has an enrollmcnl cf 10.
of this number four are men The
class is not yet full and anion: inter.
ested in the sport is encouraged to

A class for women of the faculty
circle group nieels each Monday night
from 7‘30 to 9:30 o’clock. The flint
half hour is devoted to Englmh CGIII‘v
try dancing and the remaining time to
volley ball.

Interest in badminton is developing
rapidly, Miss Andeisen stated. This
sport, though popular in the east
and the west, has not achieved any
widc popularity in tlic middlewcsl,
Mlss Andersen explained. The gamc
is similar to tennis but is played with
lighter and smaller racquets, and a

This sport. while it is being played
mainly by the women, is open lo any
men who may care to play, The

 

court is locui‘e’rl in the women's gym.
