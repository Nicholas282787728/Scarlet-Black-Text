fer-s are being made

lerday.

One of the oustanding points in re.
gard to the charge for the annual is
the abolition of the engraving fees.
in the past each student has usually
been required to pay a fee mnging
from 75 cents to $1.50 to cover the
cost of making the engravings used in

printing the student pictures.
Three Dollar Charge

Three dollars will be the total price
for the yearbook. This is the first
time in the history of the Cyclone that
this ice has been omitted, he said.
Students will not have to pay the on.
tire purchase price immediately but

may make an initial payment

$1.50, Light added.

A second attraction of the subscrip.
tion campaign involves the offer of a
reduction of 75 cents in the price of
the ticket to the Cyclone ball, which
will be held sometime during the
second semester. This reduction will
be available upon presentation of a
receipt of full payment for the Cy.
clone.

“New Era” Theme

The new edimrial features will be
many and varied, according lo plans
revealed by the heads of the publica—
tion, The book will carry out a de.
‘finita theme—heralding of a new era
and will combine the traditional Cy.
clone features with several new ones.

A new binding, which will serve
to carry out the theme of the book,
will be used. It is a form of the
spiral binding now being used on many
notebooks, and has never been used
before on a yearbook, Editor Ted
Klein asserts.

Ger-man Lithography

A process known as German lithi-
graphy is to be used in printinglhe
book. This process, Light eprmed.
is one which produces softer arl rich-
er tones, The method, while rot new.
is one which has been achier-ng great
popularity during the last year It
is the same method of rrmtme as
used in producing the Forum maga-

Only one college in the United
States has attempted m ﬂake use of
the lithograph method 1f printing a
yearbook.~the Universis' 0f Cincin-
nati. “It is an expensie process, but
one which we feel wil'give excellent
results,” Light said.

Norton Speaks
Before Meeting
of Sunday Club

“Social Classes in England Today"
was the subject of B, H. Norton. in.
structor- in the history department, in
his talk before the Sunday Evening
club members last Sunday.

The lines of the English class struc-
ture are well defined, although not
rigid, according to Mr. Norton. Any
man with ability can rise. The United
States has Just as sharply drawn lines
of social stratification as England, the
speaker claimed, though admitting that
they are not so obvious as those of
the English.

“It would probably be much better
if class distinctions were open as in
England, where there is a more hon.
est facing of the social problems,” Mr
Norton asserted. The English wealthy
class. he pointed out, feels a social
responsibility for the classes, which
the wealthy class in the United States
either ignores or to which it is hostile.

The Conservative and Labor parties
in England are backed by certain so.
cial classes they represent, and when
the voter votes for his party, he is
sure of Voting for his interests as a
class. explained the speaker, while
the Liberals make up a non—conform.
rst, radical group, which does not fol.
low the other political parties in hav.

The women's intramural swimming
meet, which was to be held next Sat.

Tutors Down
Grinnell Five
in Ragged Tilt

Pioneers Inability to Sink

Free Throws Brings
24-25 Defeat

Any way you look at it, free throws
were the direct cause of Grinnell's
25-24 defeat as the Pioneers opened
the 193435 basketball season against
State Teachers at Cedar Falls Monday
night.

in the first place, rt was a gratis
toss by Peterson, Tutor substitute for»
ward, in the waning seconds of play
that spelled immediate defeat for the
Grinncllians. Incidentally, the Teachers
capitalized on nine out of 13 attempts
from the free throw line, while the
Pioneers made only six out of 14.
All the latter were sunk by Bauer.

Grinllcll Gains Lead

Gl'innell jumped into the lead soon
after the start of the game, on three
free throws by Bauer. The Pioneers
led during most of the half, and at
the end of the filst period sported a
15.11 lead.

The Tutors exhlbited a better ole
tense in the second half, and within 5
minutes after its start had snatched
the lead away from Grinnell. Browcr,
Tutor guard, showed up especially
well during the last half drive. The
Cedar Falls quintet held a slight edge
over the Pioneers during most of the
last half, but never did it consist of
more than a point or two.

' Pioneers Tie Score

With only seconds to go. Grinnell
tied up the score at 24nd“, only to
have Peterson sink the deciding graft.
is toss and give thc Tutors the game.
Both Bauer and Frye were ousted on
personal fouls before the, game ended.

The contest was very similar to the
one which Grinnell lost to State
Teachers as the season opener last
year, 34.33,

Play Ragged

Play on the part of both teams was
ragged, while bad passes frequently
cost Grinncll good shots at the basket.
None of the Pioneers stood out par-tr.
cularly over the others, with the poss.
ible exception of Capt. Dick Mason
who led the Crime]! scorers with
four baskets.

Brewer, who is playing his first
year as a Tutor regular, was the main.
stay of the Tcacheis’ offense, ringing
up nine points. Kimberlin, veteran
gum-d, also played well for the Tutors
