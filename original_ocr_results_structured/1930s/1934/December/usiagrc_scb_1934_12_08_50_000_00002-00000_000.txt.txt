WHAT CAN WE LOSE?

In an attempt to learn just what the attitude
of'the athletes on the campus is concerning the
suggestion of awarding minor letters as an added
incentive to participate in varsity athletics, the
question was directly put to two Honor G men,
two reserves from this year’s squad and two

'freshmen. Two coaches were also questioned.
The responses appear elsewhere in today’s paper.

It is interesting to consider the answers, but
hardly enlightening, One replied that most
men would Wish to make a major letter or none
at all; another that the acquiring of a minor G
would encourage a man to try that much harder
for a major embleml Some declared the belief
that such awards would not be effective in creat»
ing more interest in varsity sports, while others
denied that this would be the case. Of course
the matter cannot be solved on paper. The only
way to see if it would be effective is to give it a
try.

We wish to take exception, however, to
some of the arguments presented against the sug—
gestion. First of all, a desire for competition
and a love of the game has not proved sufficient
incentive in the past five years to bring out a
satisfactory number of football candidates. The
intramural program offers much the same plea-
sure, without the punishment involved in a fruit-
less season as a tail—end reserve. Furthermore,
the attitude of the two freshmen questioned ree
futes the assertion that most men wish a major
letter or none at all. The winning of a minor
letter could be made difficult enough that it
would really mean something to be privileged
to Wear one, and the emblem would still fulfill its
purpose of encouraging less talented but seriously
needed grid candidates to report faithfully.

Moreover, though comparatively few men
have in recent years reported for a sport through-
out their four years in college without winning a
letter, it is very rare that any remain second or
third string substitutes during the whole time—
but it is this type of fellow who is going to be
needed if Grinnell is to have 35 or 40 men on the
squad. The only reason that few have reported
faithfully in the past few years have failed to get
a letter ultimately is because the squads have
been so small. Many more went unrewarded
when Grinnell was boasting squads of three of
four full teams.

We grant that Grinnell is smaller than most
of the schools who follow the practice of award-
ing minor letters, but that does not necessarily
mean that it would not be practicable at Grinnell.
Granted also that no need for introduction of
such a practice exists in any sport but football—
though, as Harold Anderson suggests, the minor
letters might also be given in golf and tennis.

It would have been foolish on our part to
have expected any opinion from the two reserves
questioned other than what we got. They prov-
ed by their faithfulness this fall that love of the
game and a chance to work for a major G was
sufficient to keep them out working every night.
On the other hand, it is such men as the two
fl‘eshmeniwho gave approval of the suggestion—
upon whom hopes lie for a big squad next year.

There may be valid reasons for not introduc»
ing the minor letter system at Grinnell, but we
believe that those which were offered were in~
sufficient. Why not question those who must be
depended upon to make up a satisfactory squad
next fall as to their opinion before giving the
matter up? There is, after all, little to be lost
and much to be gained.

G

CAN YOU SPARE A DIME?

Dissatisfaction over the present system of
checking coats at varsities has been expressed
very frequently this fall. It seems that the only
thing about the present service which resembles
that of a regular check room is the charge,

At present the only service rendered by the
check room attendants is to hang up the coats.
The wraps are not returned to those who checked
them, they are not protected from being stolen,

and very frequently are regained by their owners
in soiled and even damaged condition.

If any charge at all is to be made for the
benefit of checking coats, the operators of the
check room should be required to offer genuine
and efficient service and should be held respon—
sible for any articles stolen. It is too much to ask
of one to pay 10 cents for the simple privilege
of having his coat hung up.

G—~
HUEY NEEDS A SWAT

Concurrently with his recent censorial activi—
ties in connection with the Reveille, student pub-
lication at Louisana State university, Senator
Huey Long has been engaging is somewhat simi—
lar action on a larger scale in an attempt to
strangle the metropolitan press in Louisana. Not
being in a position to censor what appears in the
city papers, he has had to employ different meth-
ods but, were he allowed a free hand, the result
would be the same.

Not much publicity has been given the Long
2 per cent tax on all advertising income of
Louisana papers of 20,000 plus circulation, out-
side of journalistic trade papers, but it is im~
mensely more important and promises much more
serious results than the Reveille matter. The
act setting forth the provision was, even the King—
fish admits, purely vindicative. All but one
of the 13 papers which would fall victims of the
tax have been very actively opposing the policies
of their state’s would~be dictator. The tax
would be levied for the purpose of destroying the
dissenting publicationﬁand would, had not the
papers brought Federal action to save themselves.

King Huey has held sway in Louisiana for many
years now, and as a congressional buffoon has
provided the country with many a laugh with his
inanities and supreme conceit. So long as be
restricted his activities to his own backyard, there
was no serious objection to his tomfoolery. But
when he starts meddling with such fundamental
rights as freedom of the press—not to mention his
manifest indifference to state law illustrated when
he recently elected as state senator a star
L. S. U. halfback who was a citizen of Syria, who
lived in Mississippi, was underage and unwill-
ing to run for the officFit can hardly be con-
sidered laughable. It is time Uncle Sam took
the rod in hand.

I Other Opinions ‘

won-TERENCE AND INSANI‘I'Y
(Iowa State Student)

It is an established fact that college students tend to
extremes. They are either leihaxgiiadly indifferent to
public affairs and all that go with them or are intensely
intrested in one particular phase or radical tangent of
the social or political structure.

On one side of the fence are those illiterates of the
intelligentsia whose only acquaintance with the affairs of
th day is gained through their perusal of the comic strip.
They are too lazy or consider themselves the busy to keep
posted on the events of the day.

On the outer side of the line, however, one finds
the wild-eyed, teeth-gritting radicals who can be singled
out of the crowd by the clinch of their fisLs and the
“pink" halo around their heads. As their contemporaries
they choose factions which resort to violence, flag waving,
torch parades, race prejudices and tryanny.

Without the slightest provocation they can state his—
toric facts of no significance and nusconstrued reasoning
until they are blue in the faoe. They sometimes sense
the disorders in our social setup (the same as the rest
do), but they can put forth no sensible remedies. On
some campuses such individuals are lmown as reds~and
Without hesitation are banished from the institution.

Thus it appears that neither of the extremes in the
average student body do much in the way of furthering
intellectual thought along the channels where it is most
in demand. Both groups perhaps see the problem; one
class doesn’t give a damn and the other becomes so in—
censed with the need for action that it defeats its own
purpose.

Somewhere in between those two extremes college
students should find a happy medium, indicative of their
inbellectual stratus, that would range somewhere between
indifference and insanity.

,AN EDITOR. EXPLODES
(McGiIl Daily)

A man 'of great talent is a public nuisance in this
respect, that he often becomes a magnet which attracts a
horde of‘ Little Men, whose sole excuse for existence is
that they ape the ways of the Great Man, They usu—
ally do it very badly, and- worse still, they almost invari.
ably fashion their dull mimicries on some personal
prejudice of their master. ‘\

There is a case in point which is a particularly sore
one with us just now. A certain highly—esteemed teach-
er is strongiy antipathetic to newspapers. We can ex.
cuse this and still hold absolutely no grudges. After
all, a newspaper is never an excellent specimen_ of art
or worionanship. It takes liberties with our language—
ofteri. indeed, it goes timber. and carries out a whole.
sale massacre. Newspaper reporters habitually write
about things of which they have absolutely no knowledge,
or at best very little. Too often, their medium of ex-
premion is a tool which they never have, and never will
learn to employ correctly. Ah yes, we are indeed an
imperfect lot.

The precise professor has never been able to undere
stand why a daily newspaper is not a model of expression
and a textbook of learning. We know why, but let
us not bother about that.

It is not very difficult to pick faults, to be caustic,
sitting in an easy chair with plenty of leisure and a
total ignorance of the conditions governing th object
of your capacity. Moreover, it lakes a little less
industry to pick a fault than to make it. it is this
crass snickeruig at the inconsequential that infuriatcs us,

A good cure would ho to hold a. gun and a stop-
watch over the snickel‘er, and give him four- minutes,
fifty-five seconds. to write a three mast head—exactly 17
units per luieHin select English. That would be a
little cruel, perhaps, but certainly justifiable.

why cal-um critics realize that the daily newspaper
can never be an instrument of fine expressionmthc de-
mands placed upon it are too great for that—but that
it has nevertheless, a definite purpose to fulfill? The
question should be whether or not it has fulfilled its
proper purpose, and not of the academic nicety of its
language.

CHAPEL
NOTES

Frederick L. Baumann, associate
profesmr of history, discussed “Com—
munication," “Proverbs." and “The
Hebrew Book of Proverbs” in the
three regular chapel periods this week.
The talk of Hubert c. Herring supr
planted the program on Monday.

in his first talk Mr. Baumann
slretched the historical development
of means oi communication to explain
presenLday lack of true conununicas
tion~“meeting of minds with one one
other." “Contemporary life, with
printing, photography, radio and
newspapers. has many and constant
sources and means for real oommuni.
cation of thought. he said, However,
to many, life is a meaningless blare
and glare of means to communicate
to, rather than with." He poinmd out
that if communications were fewer,
they might be better.

A proverb, he deﬁned as ”a real
thought with truth and vitality enough
to keep it alive through the ages,” with
the qualities of “brevity, pugelicy and
piquancy, and universality."

In his final talk he expressed the
thought that, by a study of proverbs,
and the Hebrew Book of Proverbs in
particular, modems would profit by
“fewer words, more sense, greater
power, and enter into truer communi—
cation of human heart to human
heart.”

At the Friday assembly Harald B,
Holst, instructor in voice accompanied
by Mrs. Elsie Haggard Ryan, instruc.
tor in harp and piano, offered three
vocal numbers—"The Wanderer” by
Shubert, “The Jester" by Hancock,
and “Vision Fugitive" by Massenat.

Inquiring Reporter 1

Question—What do you think of the
suggestion of awarding minor letters
as a means of creating wider interest
in varsity athletics?

HAROLD ANDERSON. '34, “I think
that in a school the sire of Grinnell
this would not he a very good plan.
1 firmly believe if a fellow is interest—
ed in any of the sports, he will come
out for the sport without the induce.
merit of letters and sweaters.

“Our school is small compared to
the schools which award minor letters,
and the men who get out in any of the
sports have an oportunity to make a
letter in their three years of compe-
tition.

“Our present plan of giving honor.
ary letters and sweaters to fellows
who have stayed out four years takes

the place of minor letters, and makes
it possible for almost anyone to win
a letter in some sport.

JULIUS BAUER, '36, “I do not be—
helieve the system of minor awards
would work in Grimell, because
there are not enough participants in
,varsity athleu‘cs, If the varsity squads
in the future are large enough to
Warrant the awarding of minor em—
blems, I certainly would favor this
means of award to stimulate interest,"

BOB REESER ,’1l7, “I don’t think
awarding minor letters would create
a wider interest in varsity athletics.
While every man out for a team sets
the earning of a letter as his main
objective, I believe every man is chief—
ly concerned with the enjoyment he
gains from the sport.”

RALPH WEST, ‘37, "I don't think
that the awarding of minor letters
would increase the interest in sports,
because most fellows would want to
win a major letter, or none at all ”

KEITH DE LACY, ’38, “My opinion
of this question is that it would be an
aid to the creation of interest of
earning a varsity distinction, It would
classify the athletes more minutely. A
fellow who had acquired a minor let—
ter would be more eager to win a ver-
s'ty emblem, if having any ambition
in his personality at all."

HOWARD W'ITTROCK, ’38, “I think
that awarding minor letters for var.
sity sports would increase the size
of the varsity squads and also in-
crease interest in the spam.”

COACH TESTER DUKE—“I doubt
the practicability of a minor award
system in at school the size of Grinnell,
I have always maintained that a man,
providing he has the keen desire and
is willing to make the necessary sacri-
fice, can earn his Honor G befole
graduating Personally, i would rath-
er work for three years, realizing I
had a chance for an Honor G than to
receive any number of minor awards,

”I seriously doubt if offering mater-
ial incentives would greatly increase
the size and quality of our varsity
squads. Rather, we need more men
who will turn out because they lovc

the sport and are willing to do their
part to see Crinnell in the win column
more often."

COACH L. L .WATT, “I think the
of minor letters in football would be
all right if the fellows on the squad
favor it. if a minor letter would be
appreciated enough totinm'ease the
Size of the squad, it would certainly
be worth while.”
