Paris Quintet
Offers Recital
This Evening

Members of Group Praised
by European Critics

as Fine Artists

Rare and beautiful tone coloring,
because of the unusual combination
of instruments, is promised in ad-
vance notices of the Par-ls Instru-
mental quintet, which will appear at
8 o’clock this evening in Herrick
chapel, as the third number on the
Grinncll recital course.

Semester fee booklets will admit
students.

The flute, harp, violin, viola and
violoncello are the instruments in-
cluded in the quintet, members of
which are Rene LeRoy, Pierre Jamct,
Rene Bas. Pierre Grout, and Roger
Boulme.

Group Honored

A number of the foremost com-
poscrs of the day have been inspired
to write new works especially for
the quintet, according to advance
notices. included are D'Indy, Rous—
sel, Debussy, Ravel, Hindemith and
Pierne.

On its first American tour at
present, the quintet only recently
gave the premiere performance of
Gabriel Pierne's “Variations Libres
et Finale" composed especially for
this organization. The work was
pronounced by the French magazine,
Le Temps, to be “a masterpiece of
elegance. originality and novelty of
instrumentation."
Revive Nmnbers

The repertoire is, by no means
limited to modern composers. Com—
positions of such old masters as
Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn. Schu-
bert sad Handel are included. Some
of these works had long been neg—
leeted and forgotten before the coin-
tet came into being 11 years ago and
proceeded to uncarth them from
their dusty shelves.

As an example of continental
praise which the quintet has received,
L‘Echo de Paris says, "Composed of
artists of the first rank, all individu-
ally well known, the Quintettc In-
strumental de Paris is not only in-
teresting on account of the works
contained in its repertoire, but truly
unique in the variety and colour of

Outfit Favored to Win

The strong Gustavus Adolphus
swimming team, after barely losing
to Nebraska 43 to 41 yesterday, was
to meet Grinnell's untried mermen in
the local pool this afternoon at 4:30
o’clock.

Boasting one of the strongest
swimming teams in years, and at the
height of the season. the St. Peter.
Mina, squad was doped at the outset
to be too much for the Pioneer pad-
dlers. The outstanding swimmers cf
the northern aggregation are three
brothers, Milt, Stan, and Bump
Gabrielsen. who are co-holders of
four stale records. The brothers
swim backstroke. breaststroke, free
style, and also dive.

Grinnell, just after examinations.
and minus several men, is in a weak
position. Rheumatism has definitely
put John Shephsrd, veteran diver, out
of competition for the time being,
and Marvin Togct, dash man, will not
be able to enter the meet because of
outside work. It is also possible that
James Putnam and William Taggart
will be ineligible.

Those who are entered in the meet
for Grinncll are Dave Malbrough,

Professor Lavell

to Publish Volume
of Greek History

Publication in the near future of
“A Biography of the Greek People,"
latest book of Prof. C. r. Lovell. pro-
fessor of history of thought. was re
cently announced by Houghtoh M »
flin company of Boston. It will 3.1.7»
pear in March or April.

Faced with the need of a reference
book relating the source of Greek
fame and the definite contribution of
the Greeks to present Amciicsn ci ’
lizatioa, Professor Lovell found him-
self unable to obtain such a volume.
Most of the works on the subject he
found to be arranged for the Students
of the classical and historical phases
of Greek cultur

To meet this situation, Professor
Lave]! determined to write a history
of the Greeks from a new angle. ”A
Biography of the Greek People,”
which was the result. has been de~
scribed as an epic of Greek thought.
Rather than treating events as mere
historical facts, the volume deals
with them as the background for the
development of the Greek mind.

Philosophies from Thales to the
stoics are considered in an effort to
give the reader a clearer view of the
problems of the twentieth century.
