THE OLD ORDER CHANGETH

Announcement is made in this issue of The
Scarlet and Block of the new Student Council of-
ficers for the coming year. With tlleir installation
ll 't week, these men and women have the op-
portunity of creating on this campus the, most
powerful student government that tlle school has
ever cilia ‘ed, and one, which if handled wisely
and off iently, can benefit the school ill numer-
olis ways.

The new council 'n a position to bargain
with the administration and the, facility ill seek-
ing‘ student reforms and fulfillment of student re-
quests as never before. It is a power which, if cm-
ployed expediently, can create lunch closer relay
tions between the students and the faculty and at
the smile time ooliiu'lond consideration of student
pleas which might previously have been ignored.

With their extension of powers, the new offi-
ciols must also accept added respoll b it, Wheths
er the new, democratic student government will be
a success, whether it slmllrhe continued in succeed—
ing years, whether Grilillell students can govern
themselves satisfactorily—all these questions will
be answered by the activity of the newly elected
council (hiring the coming year. All the students
are, no doubt, completely confident that they are,
capable of self government, but it remains to the
officers of their choice to convince the School ad-
ministration and the facility.

G
JAPANESE IMPERIALISM

Editor's note: In the preceding issue of The
Scarlet and Black, an editorial was printed sup»
porting an indifferent attitude on the part of
the United States toward the recent Japanese
ultimatum in regard to China. Herewith iS pre-
sented the opposing point of view, in support
of American intervention.

_ In attempting to formulate a Monroe Doctrine
in regard to the Far East, Japan has endeavored
to apply nineteenth century methods to twentieth
century condition During the nineteenth century
the western natiol , were engaged in fl polit ' of
economic imperialism which resulted in a wild
scramble for colonies. Since Japan did not become
westernized until late ill the nineteenth century,
she was not able to secure additional tel itory as
had the other nations.

Today she is suffering "Om ovcr population
and is seeking relief by adopting an imperialistie
policy. The latest trend of this iinpcrialistic policy
has lilailiquted itself ill the forlll of the recent doc-
larotion of Japallfs, claiming;r that she. has special
rights ill regard to China, whom she has long been
Elldeﬂvol‘illg to dominate.

This latest declaration of Japan’s in direct
violation of the Nine Power poet in whi h Japan
pledged herself to not only maintain the territorial
integrity of China, but also to refrain from seek-
ing ally advantage arising from the unsettled coil-
rlitions in China.

The out stand taken by the state depart-
luent is indic tivc of the American attitude toward
China. A firm in 'stencc upon Japan’s li ing up
to her treaty agreements is the, only lloitolilble ace
tion to taltc in regard to this latest incident. The
If ited States is honor bound to uphold the, lel'l’lr
torial into) lty of China, not only because of the
.\'illc Power pact. but because, of later aqrcclncnts
as well. Thi can only he done by firmly ill ' in'x
that Japan live up to her treaty agrccllleills, The
United States could not: with any consistently aban-
don (‘hina to Japanese domination unless the gov-

‘nmcllt wishes to reverse the former policy of the,
state department, in regard to the, eastern qiit -
tioll, and espociallyiu regard to the ”open door”
poll _ in China.

Japanese domination of China will not bring
about the peaceful condition that Japan claims.
China, which is far larger than Japan, will not,
consent to be dominated by a. smaller country If
Japan succeeds ill upholding her recently enunciat-
ed doctrine, China will be practically helpless iii

HONEST CONFESSION
(N. C. P. A.)

College editors haven't an exaggerated idea of their
importance because they know they aren't important.
One can't stand the verbal barrage from the offices of
the dean of women, the rleau of men, the president, the
head of the sociology department, the leader of the
orchestra, and the iiivective of every dance publicity
chairman nnd student council member without getting
the idea that everyone in the school is his boss. AS for
power, most college editors have no power because they
haven't cared to exercise it. Those who have, have dis-
covered that instead of estrauging the staff it draws
them closer to him. When a crusading- college editor
fights for council reforms, against the ROTC, and takes
the stand of every progressive move on his campus, he
finds that his staff is back of him 100 per cent.

College editors do not think they are important bee
cause they know their tenure of office is short. They
cannot be "bossy and dogmatic" because the writers
whom they pay nothing can do nothing easier than leave
their typewriters, and the paper doesn't, come out. Col-
lege editors are neither saints nor devils. Instead, they
are a sort of pink-cheeked cherubims who get a tremen-
dous "kick" out of editing the Rah Rah College Herald
at the some time keeping an eye on that job after grad—
uation on the Hollytown Daily Bugle.

‘How To CATCH DlLuNGEE-
(Iowa State Student)

Saturday every Democratic member of Congress rer
ceived a. inspage leaflet on the very pertinent subject,
“How to'Defeat a Republican.”

The leaflet gives the proper instructions for keep-
ing the Republicans under heel and is liberally inter-
spersed with the “do‘s” and “dou‘ts” of a successful
‘poiitical campaign.

It seems that at the present time a leaflet distri-
buted to leaders of the political party in question on
“How to keep the price of hogs above so; how to catch
Dillinger; how to fly the airmail; bow to sell liquor now
that the bootlegger has been run out of business; how to
keep the Blue Eagle out of Henry Ford’s reach; and how
to keep the government milk contracts from going
sour," might be quite as appropriate as subduiug the Re-
publieaiis.

It would be a great deal more sensible to say the
least.

ABOUT VVODIEN
(Daily Kansan)

The women must take the blame this time. At last
a college man has had the courage to voice his convic-
tions regarding feminine etiquette and appearances, and
what a panning his coed readers take:

This daring young man presumes. in a column of
the University of Washington paper, to point out in no
gentle manner some things he doesn’t like. Here are a
few of his pet aversioos:

Women, who look like a parenthesis mark when
they dance; who sing in the ear of their date; who wipe
off excess lipstick on the collars of unsuspecting males;
who talk about all their other dates; who pluck their
eyebrows unevenly; who wear mascara which runs: who
appear in sweaters which are too short; who affect vioe
lently colored fingernails and freshly set hair with n
varnished look; who pull their hose in public or chew
gum at dances.

The columnist adds, bravely, that women who feel
themselves highhatted by men acquaintances are entire-
ly in the wrong, for it is their absolute duty to speak
first and thus acknowledge the recognition.

Except for a few minor faults, Such as the above-
mentioned, and a thousand or so others too numerous
to mention, the critic is willing to admit sweetly that
"women are a necessary evil" and drops the subject.

And if there is any credi ty in the old saying that
“you can't tell a woman a thing,” he might Just as well
forget the subject when he drops it.

HEADLESS \‘VONDERS
(Daily Kansun)

Five hundred students at Temple university recentr
ly signed a petition which indicated that they wished
their heads chopped off, according to the Temple News,
student publication which was responsible for the cireii-
lating of the petition.

Supposedly carried on to proce a fact, that every»
one has long known for a good many years,that some
people Sign papers without reading them, this stunt
seems nevertheless to he just another publicity gag.

Many times in the past, similar statements have
been issued from various parts of the country. A slightly
original angle is added each time to the very trite story,

To say that college students, at whose doorstep is
laid blame for most of the delving that goes on in mat-
ters that should not be delved into and who are daily
called revolutionary, could so easily be duped is to ad-
mit that which youth rarely admits willingly. Students
may well stop and reflect upon such occurrences as
these. If they are so easily duped by more tricks, how
will they be able to conduct themselves when they begin
to meet real competition and maneuvering that are not
in fun?
