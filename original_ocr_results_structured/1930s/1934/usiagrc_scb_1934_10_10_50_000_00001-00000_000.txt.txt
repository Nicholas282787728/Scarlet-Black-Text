Strong Speaks

to Large Group
at Sunday Club

An overflowing crowd jammed the
associations building Sunday night, at
the second regular meeting of the
Sunday Evening club, to hear Earl D.
Strong, professor of economics, speak
on “Strikes.”

Professor Strong discussed the cause
es of strikes, possible justification. arid
development from a passive drive tor-
improvement to occasional periods of
actual physical violence. /

An important point brought out in
the address was the fact that strikes
seldom lead to violence when their
purpose is to better working concli»
tions. Such actions, Strong Said arise
only when a union is irghting for re—
cognition. The speaker also drew a
comparison between the strikes of
Great Blrtuin and the United States,
declaring that in England violence
seldom results from strikes, inasmuch
as unions are universally recognized
there.

R, B. McCicnon, professor of math-
matics, who has spent the last two
summers in Germany, will speak on
that country next Sunday. Another
large audience is expected, accordirm
to Joseph Conard, president of the
club.

Critic Promises Entertaining Evening
to Audience at ‘Cox and Box’ Revival

Operetta by Sullivan Based
Upon Popular Farce
of 70 Years Ago

By ll. w. hintlack

Nearly seventy years ago the editor-
01 “Punch " the famous British humor
magazine, took a little contemporary
force, that was having a good run, to
Arthur Sullivan, at that time a lad of
25 who had shown considerable genius
is composing music for Shakespeare’s
‘Teinpest", wrtlr the suggestion that
he set it to music. The title of (he farce
was “Box and Cox”

In its new form the names were
turned ar-ornrd, and as a musical farce
it became known as “Cox and Box.”
Its success was imme 'dte and tics
inendous; it was the magic key wh h
revealed the genius of Arthur Sulli—
van in setting the English language to
music.

“Cox and Box‘ is the llvellCSl of
forces. Every word is sung in rnnsic
which is always exactly pat to the
situation and the character; and when
you consider that there are only three
characters, all male and all comic, you
have an inkling of the concentrated
absurdity of the piece.

Messrs Cox and Box are young
bachelors living in London. One is a
batter, who works by day and slceps
at night; the other is a newspaper
man, who works by night and sleeps
by day. The third character, the old
sergeant, rents the some room to each
of them, mibcknownst to the other.
This Situation could only occur in
farcc or burlesque, but what a situa—
tion it makes!

May Divide Yearling’ Squad
into Groups by Weight

While no prep iootball schedule has
yet been arranged, negotiations with
both Drake and Iowa State Teachers
are under way, according to John c
Truesdalc, llcshman coach.

Drake desired a game for this week-.

meet the Gl-lnncll yearlings this fall
he said.

A game with some iunror college
team and perhaps one with Coc may
also be arranged, according to Truese
dale.

The prep mentor is considering
dividing his squad into a lightweight
and heavyweight division, if laboratory
conflicts do not make it impossible
if this is done, a giant: between the
two groups may be held near the end
of the season, Truesdale stated
