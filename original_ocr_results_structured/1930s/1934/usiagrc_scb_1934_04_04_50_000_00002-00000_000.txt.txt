The interstate conference at Grinnell this

leadership includes some of the wisest ill America.
Its membership will include delegates from nearly
50 colleges throughout the Missouri valley. (foe col-

miles awa), will be represented by 25.

STUDENT COUNCIL ACTION

In line with the suggestion made ili today ’s let-
ter to the editor, we heartily agree that. the elec-
tion of at least the president of the Student Ciﬂllns
oil mi_ht be preceded by a general primary elt‘l‘r
tion to a great adrantage. Such a proeeedilig
would increase interest in the group alld make it
more truly representative of the student body,

It is probable that Student Council elections
will be held next week, so action on the matter
must be taken by tile council Sunday if anything
is to be done. At the same time. it will be well to
investigate a possible revision of student govern-
ment on the campus. ill order that all bodies may
understand their functions more thoroughly.

Elective offices of the council include the
president, vice president, alld scvnal collimittees.
If another committee. to ropi hi the Student
Council on the dramatic council, could be appoint-
ed or elected, a very obvious need would be satis-
fied. A. it is, the dramatic (-ouneil is composed
of two 'tudellts from National Collegiate Players.
and two fronl The (lrillilell Players ill addition to
the, head of the drama department aiid the deans
of men and women. Thus, tiidcnt representation
on the drama council is confined to a restricted
group. ch believe that the two members of Nae
tiollal Collegiate Players and the head of the dra-
ma department provide snffi ielit representation
for that department ill the ﬁollllril, and if two
representatives of the Student. Council were to re-
place the two 'Irom The (ti-illnell Playe ., there
would be increased student interest ill drama pros
ductions oil the campus,

IL DUCE; THREAT, PROMISE, OR BOAST7
\Vlleli Premier Mu olilli announced the other
day that by tile twent, st century the world will
be Fascist, “a black shirt era,” the statement
caused some comment. Students, together with citi-
zens of all countries of the world. are wondering
this announcement is to be taken as a threat. a
promise. or a rather large boast.

Several factors must be considered before we
can label I1 Ducc 'tartling world pronouncement.
Two forces immediately come to mind as possible
stumbling blocks or bar to this plan for It al_ —
Hitler and Russia. Although Hitler has not pub-
liely proclaimed any such intention, many people
feel certain that his ambitions rim along praetie
ally the same lines. It is conceded that Hitler is
not as “big” a man as the Italian premier. hilt he
'has perhaps a stronger nation behind him. One
wonders just what would happen if two such wills
hacked by the two nations would etnnt‘ together I“
ll contest to force the i ‘llt‘ of supremacy.

However, it appears that Russia is the '
ohstaelc of this sort ill the path of Mussolini. The

STUDE TS ARE ADULTS
(From the Indiana Daily Student)

“If the time ever comes when we are prepared to
treat university students like adults We shall see further
economies in administration," Robert Maynard Hutchins,
president of the University of Chicago. declared in a re-
cent article in the Yale Review. “Universities," he said,
“have developed the idea in parents, or parents have de-
veloped it in universities, that the institution is in some
way responsible for the moral. social, and intellectual
welfare of the student. This is very nice for the parents:
it is hard on the universities. for, besides being expen-
sive, it deflects from their main task, which is the ad-
vancement of knowledge,

A university can not undertake to give a student
character or intellectual interest, he said. If it is to do
its Work properly the student must have these qualities
when he enrolls Fresident Hutchins is not speaking on-
ly of the Uhivci ty of Chicago where he has made great
strides forward in administration and contributed in no
mean degree to the advancement of knowledge. He is
speaking of any university which finds that it is spend-
ing too much money to do the work of a custodial esA
tahlishment, a. church or of a bodybuilding institute,

Parents who do not make adults of their children
before they ship them off to college unquestionably are
handicapping not only the school which receives the chil-
dren but also the children themselves. If a boy or girl
can not take care of himself or herself by the time cola
iege age is reached, it is unlikely that he or she will learn
to do so without considerable pain and without unneces-
sary trouble and expense for the school which receives
him or her.

Editor,
The Scarlet and Black.
Dear Sir:

During the year there have been
numerous citricisnis about the inac-
tivity of several organizations on the
campus. One of these organizations is
the Student. Council. it is not the
purpose of this Writer to either up-
hold or tear down the actions of this
year‘s Student Council. However, I do
believe that there is a way in which
this criticism can be avoided in fur
hire years.

Under the present plan of election
for the elective offices in the Student
Council the students do not get a very
wide range of choice. The Council
nominates two persons for each po»
sition. However, on many occasions
only one good capable person is of-
fared with a very weak opponent.
This gives the students only one pos-
sible choice.

Why. since the Student Council is
an organization of students and pri»
marily for students, couidrrt the
council be elected entirely by the stu-
dents? That is, have a primary eicc.
tion for the nominations, and from
the results of this election choose
the highest two or three to run in
the final election. in this way, the re-
sponsibility would be wholly upon the
students, and if the organization was
not conducted to suit the tastes of the
student body as a whole there would

he no comeback, since the officers
were selected by the students. .

in this method of election the Stu—
dents themselves would be able to
vote for those whom they thought
were the ones most capable of carry-l,
ing on the duties of the student'
Council, whereas in the present plan
one is forced to vote for one of two
persons even though the voter does
not think that either is the correct‘
choice.

Sincerely,
