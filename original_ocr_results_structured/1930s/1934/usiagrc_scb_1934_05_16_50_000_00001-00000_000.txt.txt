DOUBLE CHAMPION

Bob Morgan, double ,winner in
the state ecllcgc meet Saturday,
denied that his surprising marks
in the shot put and discus wore
the result of ill temper as had
been rumored. His performance in
both events for surpassed any
thing he had done before and it
ivos said he was angered because
he was denied the privilege of
warming up before his shot tri-
als, giving him added incentive.
“In fact," he told J. C. Truesdale,
athletic director, “I didn‘t core if
the shot want 25 or 45 feet. But
he’s two times a state champion
now, whether he was angry or not.

Spanish Authors Prefer Blonlde Type

to Conventional Brunette Says Curtis

American Misconceptions
of Spanish People
Very Prevalent

By ROBERT lliw N

Too many people, Spain and all
things Spanish are remote and hazy.
The popular belief seems to he that
Spain is still a medieval nation, iso-
lated from the rest of Europe and
full of backward people,

A recent interview with Elisa Cu ,
tis assistant professor of Span sh,
coirccted all such idcas. According to
M Curtis, there is nothing in the
character of thc avoiagc Spaniard of
Madrid which marks him as back-
ward, or in any way greatly different
from the normal run of Europeans
and Americans Emilio, Pope, and
Mario, the gay brothers of "The no
mantic Young Lady," next production
of the drama department, to be pre-
sented Friday, arc the Spanish proto-
type of three young Americans cagcr
to see the world. Rosario, the ma
mantic young lady, suffers from the
same strong desires which American

 

girls of the same age and tempel‘ar
ment feel. And Grandmamma. who
had three husbands whom she loved
and plagued to death, might easily
be found in this country, asserted
Miss Curtis.

It is the rapid dialogue, by turns
mocking and romantic, and the
adroitness with which Sierra has por-
troyed the longings of Rosario, which
give "The Romantic Young Lady" its
fresh and foreign atmosphere.

Some members of the audience may
be confused that the part of Rosario
is being played by Truly Trousdalc,
who is very blonde, But, according
to Miss Curtis not all Spaniards arc
dark; and fair heroines have long
been favorcd by Spanish poets and
novelists.

According to Donald Ross, business
manager of the production, the sea—
son tickets sold by the dramatic rice
pertment last fall will admit only to
this Friday's performance of "The
Romantic Young Lady." Special
tickets will be required for the com-
mencemcnt presentation on June 1,

The performance Friday night will
be given in the auditorium in Alum-
ni Recitation hall and will begin at
8:15 o'clock.

Grinnell Scribes
Elect Lane, Pate
Malteaser Heads

Ralph Lane, '35, of Des Moincs was
elected as the new editor of the Mal-
tcascr, and Ted Pate, ’36, of Denvei,
Colo, as business manager at the re.
gular meeting of Sigma Delta Chi

Dope Favors
Aggie Squad

Conference Teams to Meet

at Des Moines Saturday

Encouraged by the showing made
on the last two Saturdays, Les Duke,
Pioneer track coach, will take the
Grinnell squad to Des Moines Sature
day with the hope of wmning the
1934 Missouri valley track and field
title.

while the Oklahoma Aggies are fa-
vored to take the championship, the
Pioneers‘ chances have been appre-
ciably increased by the fact that no
Butler entries have been received as
yet. Since the Indiana team is strong-
est in the distance runs, its absence
would give Grinnell a number of
points which had not been planned
on.

According to Duke, neither Wash-
burn nor Tulsa, the new members of
Lhe Valley group, are likely to send
any representatives to the meet. The
former has another meet scheduled
for Saturday and a Tulsa officer stat-
ed at the last conference business
meeting that it was improbable that
his school would compete,

The same Grinnell runners and
field entries who scored in the state
meet last Saturday are expected to
place in their events at Des Moines.
If Sears of Butler does not compete,
Pheiffer will be favored to win one
or both of the distance runs, while
the mile relay quartet should also be
good for a first. other Grinnell vch
toi-ies cannot be safely predicted.

Among the stars of the other val-
ley teams are Tichenor, weight man,
Gallagher, sprinter and hurdler, and
Rigney, javelin thrower, of Oklahoma
eggies; McClure, Washington sprint—
er: and Worden, sprinter, McGee, dise
taiice runner, and Stringfellow. hurd-
lcr, of Drake.

Oskaloosa Shot Put Star
Expected to Shatter
Weight Mark

Approiiimntcly 230 athletes from
more than 80 schools will take part in
the annual Iowa state interscholastic
track and field meet to be held on
Ward field Saturday, after having
survived the elimination trials in
eight district meets last weekend.

Evidence of recordrbreaking possi-
bilities can be seen in the results of
several of the district meets. The rec-
ord most likely to fall is in the shot
put. Floyd DeHecr of Oskaloosa het-
tered the old record of 48 feet 10
9-10 inches with a toss of 51 feet 11%
inches in the district contest at Fair-
field, but the mark will not he recog-
nized as official since state marks
must he made in the final meet.

star Sprinters

Excellent competition will be pro-
vided in the 100»yai‘d dash. although
it is doubtful that the record of :09.7,
set last year by Nelson of Clinton,
will be surpassed. Saggau of Denison
and Cretzmeyer of Algona each won
their district races in :09.8, while
Robinson of North High school of
Des Moine‘s. was clocked in 10 sec
oncls flat.

District winners include Fort
Dodge, West Waterloo, Davenport,
Estherville, East Des Moines, Jeffer-
son and Lincoln High schools of
Council Bluffs, and Washington High
of Cedar Rapids. other strong teams
will compete for Denison. Newton,
Dskaloosa, and North High of Des
Moines.
