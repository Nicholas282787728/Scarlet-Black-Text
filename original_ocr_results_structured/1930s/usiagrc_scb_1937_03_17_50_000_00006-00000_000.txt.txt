Lafayette President
Believes Country Scraps
Best Mental Power

Philadelphia, Pa.7(ACP)—We
are more inclined to waste brains
than we are to waste money!

At least that is thc claim made
by Dr. William Mather Lewis,
president of Lafayette university,
to the Philadelphia Alumni assor
elation.

“We scrap the best mental
power of the country at the mo-
ment it has most to offer. Colleges
retire administrative officials and
professors at the time when they
are at the height of their intellec-
tual effectiveness.

”The federal government now
proposes to follow this unfortu~
nate precedent and deprive itself
of the best judicial ability in the
nation," stated Dr. Lewis.

"A college organization second
to none could be created by using
men now being put on the retired
lists of various institutions, The
ouLstanding intellect: of America
today are Chief Justice Hughes,
Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, Pres.
James Rowland Angell, Senator
Borah, Mr. Justice Brandeis, Hon.
George Wharton Pepper, Dr. John
Finley, Prat. Bliss Perry. Pres.
Mar-y Woolley and Walter Dam-
rosch.

f'People who have taken advan—
tage of modern knowledge con-

 

cerning dietetics, exercise, saunter
tion and serenity are no older than
their grandfathers were at do,”
said Dr. Lewis.

Larger College Classes
Indicate Dapression’s
Finally Over

The depression is really over, if
the size of college classes is any
indication. Forty per cent more

junior women are eligible for po-
sitions on League hoard this year
than were last yearn This large
increase is due partly to the
greater size of Lhe class of 1938,
and partly to the smaller percen-
tage of women who have left
Grinnell in recent years.
Seventyrnllle women are eligible
ths year, in contrast to 57 last
spring. or this year’s junior
class, as women, or 70.5 per cent,
have spent their entire college
careers at Grinnell. in the class
of 1937, know-n as the “depression

class," do women, only 52.8 per-

cent of the total eligible as jun—
iors, had come here as freshmen.

What a. columnist of the )iinner
sofa Dally heard at the Minel‘s'
shindig: “Here, John, put my
plu‘SP in your pocket. It Won't
