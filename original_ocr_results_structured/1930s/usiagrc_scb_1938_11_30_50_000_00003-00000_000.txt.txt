Cagers Fight tor
Starting Positions

Pioneers to Have
Faster andSmaller
Team This Season

By Clark A. Smith.
With the first basketball
game of the year only nine

days away, Coach John C.
Truesdale is driving his squad of

15 cagers at top speed.

A starting lineup is far from
settled and recent developments
in the personnel of the squad have
left the field wide open for almost
all the candidates.

Reserve strength at center and
forward has been undermined cone
siderably with the decision of
Donald Ruliffson to drop basket»
ball. Ruliffson’s height and shoot-
ing ability will be missed as he
was considered a likely prospect
for’the starting quintet. Richard
Adkins, a promising sophomore,
has also left the squad to devote
his activities to swimming.

Present indications are that
this year‘s team will be smaller
but faster than last season's high
scoring outfit.

Fred Luther, John Turner and
Gerald Fort all stand several
inches under six feet and are
probable first string men. What
they lack in size they make up
for in ball handling, uncanny
shooting ability, good floor play
and speed.

For height around the basket,
the burden will fall heavily upon
the shoulders of the giant ii—foot,
5—inch veteran Wilbur Luick at
center. Present indications are
that Luick is rounding into fine
shape so as to turn in the best
season's performance of his ca-
reer. ,

In Capt. Robert Berry at guard,
the bachcourt will have 6-feet, 37
inches of height to offset the oth—
er small men. Berry, in addition
to his fine defensive Work, hasI
shown considerable improvement

in his offensive ability.

The elo gated guard is show-
ing a wi 'ngness to take a few
shots rather than confine himself
solely to defense and setting up
plays as he did last year.

other men showing promise and
receiving considerable of ﬁnes
dalc's attention are James Nash,
Vern Robinson, Gene Peisner and
George Tompkins.

Any one of these men are likely
to draw a starting assignment as
they are rated on almost an equal
basis with the five men mentioned
previously.

Nash in particular is considered
a definite threat because of his
keen eye for the basket.

'Journey's End'
To Be Produced
By Drama Group

"Journey's End" written by R. c.
Sheriff, English playwright, will
be the next production of the
drama department, it was an»
nounced today by heads of the
department.

The play will be designed and
directed by Alfred Boylen, l'ne
structor in drama: “Journey's
End” contains ten roles, all played
by men, and the entire action
takes place just behind the front
lines in the last war.

Tryouts will be held tonight at
7:30 pm. in Room 11 of the Alum~
ni Recitation hall, Boylen stated.
He also stressed the fact that un-
less a sufficient number of men
appeared at the first tryout, pro—
duction would be dropped immee
diately.

 

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Flapper Athletes
Skip, Crawl for
Honor ‘G’ Club

Bathing suits, hip-boots, ulhblci-
las, rain coats and liberal debs of
makeup are all tender-d equips
mont for nine i atcs of the
Honor “G" club this week.
Those "fortunates" who are go—
ing- through the preliminary baz-

ling until the main event Thurs»

day night are Harry McDuff,
William Fort, Robert Hamaim,
Edward Walters, Raymond Cross
man, Robert M'oehl, Edward
Vaughn, George Little and John
Kennefiek.

Each Committee.

Each night this group has been
meeting with a committee con-
sisting of Ted Appelquist, Robert
Jones, William Pedersen and Vern
Robinson to learn their fate for
the following day.

Monday the initiates skipped
gaily about the campus, and
Tuesday they crawled up and
down stairs.

Before entering a building each
man must repeat.the following:
“The Honor "G" is the club for
me and though it be we fools you
see, we recognize supremacy."
Pool- Memories.

some of the men are reported
as having poor memories in that
the lines have been given in many
a twisted version.

Another feature of the initia-
tion is the unique haircuts that
were designed and trimmed with
the use of a bowl.

Dinner Monday Evening.

After the traditional “house
warming" tomorrow night, the
initiates will have become official
members of the men’s honorary
athletic organization.

The formal Honor "G” club din—
nor will be held Monday evening
in the dormitory dining room
and traditionally closes the fall
initiations.
