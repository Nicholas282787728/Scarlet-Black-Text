several British subjects, in the opin-
ion of Earl D, Strong. professor of
economics.

“1 see nothing more in this dispute
than one more example of the fear
of a capitalistic nation for a Coin-
inuiiistic government," said Professor
Strong, when interviewed. “Such
difficulties may he expected from
time to time, as long as such widely
different forms or government exist.

Not Likely to Affect U. s.

The United States has paid no at-
tention to the matter so far. and it
'is unlikely that it will at all."

The only way in which the contra»
versy could possibly affect us, in the
opinion of the economics professor, is
that England may abolish her trade
with Russia, in which case our gov-
ernment would probably recognize
the soviet nation, enabling us to in-
crease our commerce grcatly. This is
unlikely. however.

Russia in the Right

"Russia is not anxious to become
involved in a war," stated Mr. Strong.
"0n the contrary, she will make every
effort to avoid a conflict. I believe‘
her army exists more purely for pur-
poses of defense than that of any‘
other nation except onrselve 3

Regarding the controversy itself,i
Professor Strong feels that Russia is‘
in the right, since the Englishmen
involved were living in Russia at the
time, and were therefore subject to
Russian law. They were given a fair,
trial. "In my opinion, the British;
acted hastit-y in this matter, under l
pressure froi. the conservatives," he
added.

 

Illes Peterson was taken to the
Community hospital Thursday with
the sore throat and from there he
was taken to his home in Des Moines

tled right . . . that’s one
reason why it burns so slow
and cool.

VKHEN we Siﬂl‘th to make Granger
1 Rough Cut we knew that ﬁne tobac-
co burnt hot because it burnt so fast. It
kept your pipe hot. You could hardly
hold your pipe in your hand, it got so
hot at times.

Then we remembered that some folks
back yonder used to “Whittle” their 1.0-
bacco. So we made GRANGER just like

)vhiltle” tobacco — "Rough Cut.” It
smokes cooler and lasts a lot longer. And
also, you’ll ﬁnd it never gums the pipe.

So far, so good. Now we wanted to sell
this tobacco for 100. Good tobacco—right
process—cut right. It was a question of
how to do it for the price.

So we put GRANGER ill a sensible soft
foil poucll instead of an expensive package,
knowing that a man can’t smoke a package.
We gave smokers this good GRANGER
tobacco in a common-sense pouch for 10c.

GRANGER has not been on sale very
long, but it has grown to be ii popular
smoke. And there is this much about it
_.we have yet [0 know of a man who
started to Smoke it, who didn’t keep on.
Folks seem to like it.

The Scarlet and Black,
Dear Sir.

The letter from Howard Hush in
last week's Scarlet and Black is
deeply appreciated. I should like to
say, however, that no chairman
could make a success of any confer-
ence if he did not have behind him
a strong committee, Praise should be
divided among all those who worked
so hard to set up the conference, and
not the least of those was the writer
of that letter, who generously gave
me credit which should be shared
with him.

Probably the hardest work of all
was that of the secretary, Virginia
Warlow, who was responsible more
than anyone else for the large at-
tendance from other colleges (1147
over half as many again as last
year).

Next in line come Dave Singer,
Joe Pajmail and Barbara Phelps. The
list of speakers is sufficient to tell
what Davc did. The fact that we made
ends meet financially in spite of the
depression proves Joe's efficient
planning, and Barbara's hard work
as hostess made the social gather-
ings and the housing arrangements
an outstanding success. other mem-
bers of the executive committee whose
work was indispensable include Mary
Miuer, chairman of publicity, and
Isabell Carson, the registrar. Besides
these of the executive committee,
many more, both students and faculr
ty, offered long and valuable serv-
ice: they too should be mentioned
here, but space prohibits. To them
my thanks, though silent, is equally
sincere.
