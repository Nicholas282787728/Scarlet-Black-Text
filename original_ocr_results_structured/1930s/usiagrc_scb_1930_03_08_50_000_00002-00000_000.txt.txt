NIGHT FOOTBALL FOR GRINNELL.

Night football should be given a trial at Gr-innell
college next_fall. Afternoon games at Grinnell have
been losing money, and with only two home games out
of eight so far scheduled for the 1930 season, it is well
to consider the possibility of playing the homecoming
game with Creighton university, November 1, at night
on Ward ﬁeld.

Grinnell is the daylight orphan member of the
Missouri Valley conference in football. Drake univer—
sity was the only institution to have the "owl" sport
in the valley group when the gridiron season opened
last fall. In two months three other Missouri Valley
members, Creighton university, Oklahoma Agricultural
and Mechanical college, and Washington university,
adopted night football, but Grinnell did not install
equipment and played in the afternoon its four home
games of the 1929 program.

Drake equipped its stadium for night football in
October, 1928, after consideration by Des Moines busi-
ness men as well as by university authorities. The
successful experiences with night football of other
schools, which had suffered bankrupt athletic treasuries
from the sport when played in the afternoon at home,
was the outstanding argument for the night game at
Drake. Creighton, Oklahoma, and Washington found
afternoon football games on their local ﬁelds a great
ﬁnancial loss, and obtained economic salvation in night
playing, .

Three athletic officials of three Missouri Valley
conference schools have voiced wishes that Grinnell
Would give night football 8. trial next fall, and the re-

» maining official answered in the affirmative, but Con-
sidered it ”8. question for the school itself.” E. C. Ly-t—
ton, business manager of Drake; E. c, Gallagher.
athletic director of Oklahoma, and J. D. Braden .of
Washington hope that the Pioneers will install night
football apparatus, while A. A. Schabinger, director of
athletics at Creighton, approved the proposal, but
thought the matter 0112 for Grinnell to decide.

Night football equipment costs approximately
$3,500. Creighton and Drake spent that amount. \vhile
Oklahoma used $3,850 and Washington $5,000. With—
out charging more for seats, the increase in gate re-
ceipts sufficed to pay for night football at,all four
valley institutions. Twice as many people attended
night football games as attended afternoon contests at

Creighton, Drake and Oklahoma. and three times as
many crowded into the stadium of Francis ﬁeld at
Washington. '

People who work during the day would be able to
see football games at Grinnell, if they were played at
night. The business man and woman, the housewife
and the farmer would be able to attend night football
games. Alumni of crinnell and residents in Des
Moines, Newton, Marshalltcwn, Oskaloosa, ottumwa
and other central Iowa cities would enjoy seeing
Creighton and Gr-innell play football at night next fall.

Some manuracturers of noodlights for night foot
ball are willing to send apparatus and to equip a ﬁeld
for one game at night on approval. The Creighton-
Grinnell game next fall, which will be the homecoming
contest, would be an ideal one to use as a subject for
testing attendance and gate receipts.

Coach Schabinger of Creighton, director of athletics
and head basketball coach, would like particularly to
see the Creighton-Grinncll game played at night. He
stated, “It is only natural that I should like to see the
Creighton-Crimson football game at Grinnell, Novem-
her 1, 1930, played at night because I believe the re
ceipts will be considerably larger."

Grinnell should give night football a trial at the
1930 homecoming game. and, if'it is successful, install
permanent equipment and arrange a good schedule of
home night games for the fall of 1931.

Night football at Grinnell would make the playing
of the "Owl" sport one hundred per cent in the Missouri
Valley conferenceia distinction which might be with-
out precedent in the United states by next fall.

THE HIGH COST OF PRUDIT’IES.

As a climax to a month of endless practice and
sleepless nights, the six acts composing the Pioneer
Prudities were given last night by the cottages and
dormitories.

The praise for the Pmdltles should go to the sixty—
seven Grinnell students, who participated in the six
acts. and to more than thirty, who helped in producing
the Show. The credit for the founding of the Pioneer
Prudities belongs to the Grinnell chapter of sigma
Delta Chi. To the same organization and the Grinnell
‘cbapter of the National Collegiate Players felicitations
are due for the performance of last night.

For the third time no restriction was made upon
the amount of money used in producing an act; yet,
again, the number of people participating in a skit was
limited to twelve, The sponsors of four acts last
night were heavy losers ﬁnancially; one cottage and
hail received second prize of thirty dollars, which
partially covered expenses, and the hills incurred by
the winning pair were perhaps nine-tenths paid by
the ﬁfty dollar check.

Hereafter, ﬁfteen dollars should be given to help
defray expenses for each act which passes the pze-view
successfully. A limit of an additional thirtyvﬁve dole
lars, which would be furnished by the cottage and ball
sponsoring the act, should be made. With the cost of
each skit restricted to ﬁfty dollars, the problem of ex-
cessive expenses would be curbed, and the ingenuity
and the originality of the Cottage and ball in giving
the act would not only be shown in working with a cast
restricted to twelve, but also in the kind of costumes,
properties. and scenery limited to a speciﬁed amount.
