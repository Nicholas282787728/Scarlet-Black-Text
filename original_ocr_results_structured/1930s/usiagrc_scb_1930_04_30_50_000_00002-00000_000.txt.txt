COLLEGE PUBLICITY.
Publicity: How often that word has been con-.

demncd and still, how often space in the ews columns
has been sought for. Free advertising in this dayvof'
publicity‘is a thing to be desired. 'It is to gain this free
advertising that the majority of colleges in the United
States have established news service bureaus.

College publicity is probably the easiest sort to get
into the news columns. It is the business of newspapers
to publish happenings that will interest their readers
and sales experts teach us that one of the best methods
of appealing to adults is through their children. The
home town is always interested in the ”kids” away to
school.

Just as it is easy to get favorable publicity in the
news, however, it is difficult to keep unfavorable no<
tices from being printed. The stories that are unfav-
orable to the college are eagerly sought for by readers.

Yet it is the business of college officials to'keep the
public, which is away from the campus spirit, from get-
ting the wrong impression and often from hearing a:
all of many controversies that occur in the best of in-
stitutions. Consequently, metropolitan newspapers
maintain news correspondents at colleges for just such
events, for the news service gives ample coverage on
routine happenings. Naturally there is some conﬂict
as the news correspondents and college officials work
for different institutions and toward opposing goals,

Campus opinion here has at times condemned The
Des Miones Register and Tribune, the leading dailies cir-
culating in Grinnell, as favoring Des Moines schools and
slighting Grinnell. Yet it is possible to ﬁnd Crinnell ar-
ticles in these papers almost daily and throughout the
year they are overwhelmingly on the side of good pubs
licity. Now and then one is not so favorable but all
colleges are treated alike. Drake had her share of
trouble both last year and this when the students car-
ried things a bit to far in the Way of Iowa State-Drake
rivalry. The state university has had disputes portray»
ed in the news. Grinnell also ﬁnds these things reveal-
ed, Yet all of the colleges and universities seem to
struggle along. Perhaps the differences between the
desirable and undesirable publicity are not so extensive
as often believed.

GRINNELL RUNNERS.

Claremont, a small town in Oklahoma famed as the
home of Will Rogers, internationally known humorist,
received added popularity when one of the home-town
boys won the Pyle cross—continent Bunion derby. There
are many things for which a community may be known.
Probably nothing has brought more recognition to Grin-
nell than tracksters who have carried the Maltease
Cross into all corners of the states and across the Walt»
ers as Olympic competitors.

The personnel of the Grinnell Fire Department hose
team which Won the national race at Atlanta, Georgia,
back in the early nineties included college men. In
1902 three local high school runners collected enough
points at the national track meet sponsored by A. A.
stagg of Chicago university to win the meet. Karl
Kiesel won the half-mile and mile runs, George Long-
slmre was a sprinter and broad-jumper, while Will
Hodgon placed in the quarter-mile.

Thirty years ago the Ward ﬁeld track was built
and it is still known as one of the best in the middle
west. Such runners as “Speedy" Rush, national record
holder in the onerhundred-yard dash; "Doc" Huff and
Carl Haas, Olympic sprinters; Leonard Paulu, national
champion in tho two-twenty sprint, and Morgan Taylor,
Olympic hurdler, have all helped carry on the name of
Grinnell as a track "garden.” The junior class won the
home meet for the third ccnecutive time this year and
the yearlings placed second. Next year should be an.
other banner year. Coach G. Lester Duke's men have
won the Missouri Valley Indoor championship the last
two years and should repeat next year.

When there is a track meet at Ward ﬁeld everyone
should do his part by being present. In recent years
careful planning and promptness in following time
schedules have made the meets more interesting. No
longer must one sit for ﬁfteen minutes watching no-
thing. There is caustant activity. No sooner is one
event over than another begins. Instead of requiring
a full afternoon. the modern track meet is run off in
two hours. Every loyal Grinnellian should help build

enthusiasm by being present at the coming track meets.

I Campus Opinion

no you prefer clevcn o'clock hours
on Friday evening, or would you
_rathcr have later hours on Satur-
day?

Helen Lovejoy—I prefer eleven
o'clock hours. The time should he
spread out between Friday and Sat-
nrday.

Royce Minior—Why not have late
hours both nights?

Helen Parzybok—«No, I'd prefer
eleven o'clock hours on Friday be-
cause it would be too inconsistent to
have late hours Saturday night and
so much earlier hours on Friday.
Charles Lullstl'up—Twelve o'clock
hours on Saturday would make it
more convenient for everyone, giving
them more time to get ready for the
dances.

Helen McLeraun—I like the new
ideaaof having the closing hours of
Friday and Saturday more equalized.
Russell Deanﬁl’d rather see lat-
er hours on Saturday because it
would give more time for Saturday
functions.

.loc Pojmim—I prefer eleven
o'clock hours on Friday because the
evening is still young at ten-thirty.
Catherine Turner—I prefer eleven
o'clock hours on Friday because the
time is more equally divided. Ten-
thirty is too early for week-end
nights.

Elizabeth Cook — Eleven o'clock
hours are much better, I think. ,
Patsy Ferraro—Later hours on
Saturday. Enjoy the music of a
good orchestra a little longer.
