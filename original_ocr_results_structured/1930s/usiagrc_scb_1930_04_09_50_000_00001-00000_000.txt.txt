‘Netsters Take
Matches From
Three Schools

Jones and Kent Beat Kansas,
Texas Ags, Missouri
on Trip South.

‘ Play Nine Matches

Make Good Showing Against Best
Teams in Country; Jones Is

Best Against Bell.

Griunell's traveling representa-
tives of the court and racquet, Don-
ald Jones and John Kent, have re-
turned to the fold with the opening
of classes once more, bearing with
them a spring vacation record of
three victories in nine matches
against the pick of southern collegi-
ate tennis experts.

Missing the sturdy stroking of the
.redoubtable Coggeshall, to be sure,
the Pioneers nevertheless showed
flashes of real form in their contests
and in several of their defeats they
'went down only by the narrowest of
narrow margins after fighting
through three-set matches with
deuced sets, They tangled with
men of national ranking and in some
cases they came away second best
only because of the strain of travel-
ing and the fact that they had not
the season of practice hack of them
that the southerners boasted.

Grinnell Beats Kansas

The bearers of the Scarlet and
Black pulled a surprise in their ﬁrst
most when Jones swept his way to a
6-2, 6-4 victory over Charlie Sager,
three year Kansas university vet-
eran. Lawrence papers landed the
Pioneer ace as showing midseason
form. Kent was a hit wild in his
match and lost to Ted O‘Leary by
5-2, 6-4, but the Grinnellians took
the doubles, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2, to negot-
itate a 2 to 1 victory.

The win at Kansas was followed
by five long, sad and dreary days.
however. as the Pioneers hauled to
the limit. only to fail to win a
match against two Oklahoma teams
and three Texas aggrgations.

The Oklahoma Aggies were ﬁrst
to register in the credit margin
against Jones and Kent, taking a 3

- to 0 decision, English won over
Jones 6-1, 6-3, as the latter failed to
show any of the form he had dis-
played the day before. Kent put up
a ﬁght against Sawallisch but lost
in straight sets, 9-7, 8-6. English
and Sawallisch bested the Grin-
nellians in doubles, 6-2, 5-4.

Jones Loses Close Match.

Another 3 to 0 defeat was handed
the travelers at Norman, Okla, the
Oklahoma university netmen doing
the handing. Jones started fast
against Archie McColl. took the first
set, 6- 3 and was leading 5- 4 in the
second with set and match point
when the home boy settled down to
take three games and the set. Mc-
Coll finally won the match, 3-6, 7-5,

‘6—2. Kent also forced his match i -
to three sets but lost to Overhauseh,
5-2, 5-7, 5-4. Playing against a pair
of fresh men, Thunnan and Runkle,
in the doubles, the Pioneers again
battled to deuce sets but were trim-
med, 1-5, 10-3.

Texas Christian university took
sweet revenge for the defeat of 1929,
with a 3 to 0 win. Both singles
matches went three sets, however,
and-Jones forced all of his to deuce
Sets. Charles Ewell, who holds the
Texas Municipal championship,
forced his way to a 7-9, 8-6, 7-5 vic-
tory over the Grinnell number one
man and McDonald defeated Kent,
6-2, 4-6, 6-3. The two Texas won
the doubles also, 6-0, 7-5.

Berkeley Bell Met

Berkeley Bell, national intercol-
legiate singles champion and rank-
ing ninth nationally, met somewhat
of a surprise in Jones' spirited rally

Miles, Defense Advocate,
to Talk at Chapel Friday

If socialism and pacifism have
had their exponents from the
chapel platform this year, the op-
posite side of the questions will
likely have their day Friday, when
Frank Miles, editor of the Iowa
Legionaire, official organ of the
American Legion, will talk at
chapel at 8 o'clock in the morn-
ing on “National Defense."

Mr, Miles is as widely known
as any man in the state for his
staunch defense of preparedness
and for his conservatism, and his
talk at chapel Friday will likely
center around a defense of both
highly trained. well-equipped mil-
itary forces for the United States
and of the present social order.

McIlrath Is Third in Race
at Minnesota Relay Meet

only representative at
Minnesota relay carnival at Min-
neapolis Saturday, and brought
home third place in the special three-
quarter mile run. Competing
against some of the best runners in
the midwest, McIlrath set a killing
pace for the first two-thirds of the
distance, but could not hold his lead.
Thompson of Wisconsin won the
event in 3:15 5-10. establishing a new

Grinnell's
the annual

 

record for the event.

Grinnell is both praised nnspaling-
ly and analyzed critically in articles
which appear in the May issue of
College Humor, Ruth Suckow,gradu-
ate of Grinnell in the class of 1914
and well known writer, is the critic
in an article entitled "Grinnell,"
while Gary Cooper, exJ26, tells about
“A School I Love. Both articles
have received wide publicity this
past week in newspapers throughout
the state and elsewhere. The con-
tribution of Ruth Suckow is one of
a series of articles on various schools
throughout the country which Col-
lege Humor is publishing, Grinnell
being the ﬁrst small college to be
written up. *

“I wouldn‘t trade that two years
I spent in Langan ball foriwell for
a good many things that the world
seems to set a high price upon,"
ivritcs Cooper. “My only regreL,"
he says, “is that the exigencies of
life forced me to leave college two
years too soon. It isn't the loss of
a degree that I regret so mllchial-
though I would have prized a Grin-
nell sheepskin as much as the next
fellow but the loss of two years of
association with men whom I had
come to know as brothers.”

Cooper Recalls Taylor

After-
spirit engendered by the men eating
together at the dorms, and on the
facility with which one can gain re-
cognition of his native talents at
Grinnell, Cooper recalls the all-
i-ound track performances of Morgan
Taylor a few years ago and says in
conclusion "If I ever have a young-
ster, he is going to Grinnell and beat
all of Taylor‘s records. Just see if
he doesn'tl”

oldcr sister went there and
back with ‘the Grinnell fever! For
three summers, we washed and
wiped dishes to the tune of ’Come
Ye Back to Old Grinnell.‘ "
Compliments Earlier Grimicll

Contrasting her childhood admira-
tion of the school with the dreary
picture drawn of Grinnell by gradu-
ates of many eastern universities,
Miss Suckow goes on to picture the
past and present Giinnell to discover
which view is the truer. She is com-
plimentary in her impressions of
Grinnell in the earlier glamorous
days. "It was a ﬁne time ﬁrst to

light dresses were appearing on the
campus, green leaves on the many
shrubs and tress———", she declares,
and goes on in detail to relate the
story of Grinnell of two decades ago,
concluding that "this Grinnell that I
first saw had a halycon air. Its
shining enthusiasm was still untron-
bled by thought and its simplicity
almost uninvaded.”

The Grinnell of the present Miss
Suckow is much less enthusiastic

as ‘handsome mediocri-ty' and term-

ﬁlming that "the danger of becom-

‘of Grinncll, ” she takes the view that

nearly all those who come here to
school become reduced to standard-
ized, unitorm people. The Grlnnell
spirit, often extoled but never de-
ﬁned, Miss Suckow criticizes as
making the Grinnell graduate too
idealistic for the cruel world into

The ﬁrst article, “Shaw on Shake-

Juliet in “Romeo and Juliet." Micaela

in Herrick chapel.

such prominent roles as
in "Carmen," Lakma
Gilda in “Rigoletto,”
“The Masked Ball."
Miss Mock was born in California.
where she spent her childhood and
early youth. There, while she was
still young, she lost her mother, and
went to live with her friend and
teacher, from whom she received her
first instruction in vocal art. Six
years later, Miss Mack’s father died
and left her a small sum of insur-
ance. After all expenses had been
met, one booked passage for Paris.
Her decision to go to Paris to study
was reached through the great de-
sire to meet and study with the im-
mortal de Reszke.
Three Years in Paris

On shipboard, Alice Mock met a
young American girl, a pianiste, who
was returning to Paris .to study with
a former maestro. The young peo-
ple became friends, and upon ar-
rival in Paris, Miss Mock was i -
trodnced to the maestro, who, in
turn, suggested to her the name of
an American woman who had studi-
ed with de Reszke and who
doubtless would be happy to put
her compatriot in contact with the
teacher.

After three years of hard work in
Paris, during which she sang a few
concerts, Miss Mock was pronounc-
ed ready for her operatic debut,
which occurred at Montecati 1,
Italy, in 1924. From that time until
her engagement with the Chicago
company for the 1928-29 season, she
was continuously engaged in opera
and concert in Europe.

Star of Geneva Company

Miss Mock was a member of the
Marseilles company for some time,
and, during the 1925-27 season, sang
six roles with the Geneva company.
From her ﬁrst appearance there, she
was the outstanding star of the
company, and her success led to an
engagement in Paris where she did
two performances of “Lakme” and
two of Gilda in “Rigoletto.” She
also was a member of the opera
company at Cannes for a season.
Miss Mock's repertoire is extensive
and includes the standard coloratura
roles as well as a large number of
lyric roles.

The program that she will present
tomorrow evening is as follows:
