will start the game played to—
gethcr most of the last season,
the team has come along in ex-
celent firstsgame shape.

The same team which worked
so efficiently late in the season
last year will start the game,
according‘ to Truesdale.

son-tors

LaMasney and Conwill will
work at the forwards, Luick will
he at center, and Berry and Dean
will take care of the guard posts.
only three guards will make the
tii'p, but if it becomes necessary
to insert a fourth guard into the
game, Hayward will probably
move to a forward post, and Bill
Conwill wlll take over the vacant
guard position.

The Gophers will have at least
two advantages over Grinncll.
They will have one game already
under their belts, and they are
playing on their home floor.

Second Gmnc

South Dakota state will play
Minnesota tonight to give the
Swedes their first competition,
and the Pioneers will probably be
some what hampered by making
their first appearance on a large
floor after working out all season
on the smaller Grinnell court.

Minnesota will be able, as will
Gi'innell, to present virtually an
allweteran team. with the ex—
ception of one guard position. It
was this same team that won
them a tie for their conference
championship last year.

Bigger Squad

In addition, according to Dave
McMillan, Gopher coach, all the
veterans have gained considerable
weight during the past year with
out sacrificing any speed, which

should increase their effectiveness ‘

considerably.

0n the other hand, the Mlnne~
sota team will be hampered by
lack of veteran reserve material.
All the boys on whom McMillan
can depend to substitute will be
sophomores with no previous var—
sity exeperience.

The Pioneers will present an
all—veteran team, a combination
which has proven in actual com-
petition that it can work effi-
ciently. Only one sophomore,
Nash, will he numbered on the
squad, and his play has been
good so far this year, The other
four reserves, Luther, Hayward,
Cornish, and Robinson. have all
had considerable varsity exper-
ience.

Collecting and pickling spiders
is the hobby of Mrs. Harriet Ex-
line Lloyd, a doctor of philosophy

at the University of Washington.
She has 10,000 in all and 400 dif-
ferent species.

By F

to Grinncll oiic oi the llaLiol-l’si
outstanding pianists in a program
of extraordinary merit. Rudolph
Ganz is one of those unusual pea-l
pic who combine strong pcl‘sonal‘
appeal With artistic accomplish-
ment. He easily captured hisl
audience both as n muslcian'andl
as a person. i

Ganz played his Chopin wiLh
fine poetic feeling and, happily,
not with over sentimentality, He
made the piano sing in the mains
nor in which the composer surely
must have intended it. I have,
never found the ”Polonaise" to be
essential to my musical happiness,
yet I have always been aware of
its "lay 'em out" qualities. Ganz
tested the resistance of the stein-l
way in this number and proved to,
us unequivocally that it could

Perhaps lturhi couid piayl
Haydn with comparable fluidity
and grace, but surely Mr. Gunz
was without an equal this cvening.
The scintillating first and third
movements were well set off by.
the contemplative second movesi
ment which possessed the spirit
and profundity of Beethoven.

Along with the Haydn was
