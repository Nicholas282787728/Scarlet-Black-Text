Grinnell Coeds Prefer Marriage
To Leading Business Careers

That Grinnell women wouldratherz-z

marry than work when they ﬁnish
school was brought out when pret—
ty and plain, tall and short, blond,
brunett and redhead, intellectual
and lowbrow, plump and skinny,
serious and vivacious coeds were
interviewed on the subject of
whether marriage is more desir—
able than a career.

The women were picked at ran-
dom and are specializing in all
types of ﬁelds: music. art, busi-
ness, journalism, history, science
and drama.

In the face of all the contro-
vcrsy in recent years, over wheth-
er or no women are usurping
men's places in business, industry
and the professions, we thoughtit
might prove interesting to discov-
er whether college women sincere-
ly want positions upon graduation.

One of Three Solutions.

To make conditions as nearly
equal as possible, the women were
asked to imagine themselves in
this situation: you are about to
graduate; you are in love with a
young man who has a good job
and he wants to marry you but he
is willing to wait two or three
years if you insist upon working;
you have been offered an {deal
position—one in your chosen ﬁeld
with plenty of chance for advance-
ment and congenial.fellow work—
ers. Then they were asked to
choose one of three solutions: (1)
marry immediately, (2) work two
or three years and then marry,
(3) give up marriage indefinitely
and go in for a career in a serious
way.

Reasons Given.

Only two expressed themselves
as being out first, last, and al-
way for a career. Sixty—one per
cent declared emphatically that
they would marry only after they
had worked a few years. and 34
per cent pronounced themselves in
favor of immediate marriage.

Some of the reasons given for
postponement werc: desire to save
enough for some of the home fur—
nishings; desire to put to prac-
tical use some of the knowledge
acquired in college; and the desire
to prove themselves capable ot
self support.

Vigorous in Support

Those voting for marriage iin~
mediately were most vigorous in
the support of their stand.

man who loves me happy": "Any
girl who thinks a job more im-
portant than marriage is kidding
herself. This career stuff is a lot
of bunk"; “No normal woman is
happy until she's married. It's
biologically impossible"; "It isn’t
fair to ask a man to wait that
long"; "One ought to have children
while still young enough that you
can be young with them”; and of
course the old legend, “Women's
place is in the home."

Career Woman Doomed.

When asked whether they
thought it wise to combine a job
and marriage, 32 per cent voted
yes and as per cent voted no.

If these women-s opinions are
at all representative of the gener»
al thought of young women in
America, then it would appear
that women are not particularly
anxious to take men's places and
that the age of the career woman
