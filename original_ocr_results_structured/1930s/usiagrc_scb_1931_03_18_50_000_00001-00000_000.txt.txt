Maurice Hindus Will Speak Tonight

Steiner Lauds
Latest Volume
on New Russia

Author, Lecturer Authority
on Eastern Countries;

Lectures at 8

"If Europe has another war, it
will become the yard, and a smelly
back yard of Asia,” is one of the e
grams quoted from Maurice C,
dus, who will speak in Herrick chap~
el at 8 o’clock tonight. The speaker
comes under the auspices of the Grin.
nell College Lecture course.

His subject has not been definitely
announced. “Asia Aflame" and "Rus-
sia and the World" are two of the
titles from which the selection may he
made.

Knows Ngtive People

Mr. Hindus has made more than a
half dozen trips to Russia since the
Bolshevik revolution Himself a Rus-
sian born. he has been able to tramp
and ride to the most inaccessible
districts, and to talk to all classes in
their own language.

“Humanity Uprooted," published in
1929. is the lecturer’s latest volume
on the subject of reborn Russia. In
speaking of it yesterday, Edward A.
Steiner, professor of applied Chlist
anity at Crinnell, said, "I think his
book is the most authentic one on
Russia; it is praised by everyone.

Author of “Gipsy Twilightn

Of Mr, Hindus himself, Professor
Steiner went on, ”AS a man he is
most highly regarded. As a lecturer
he is most interesting. If they don't
get their money‘s worth tomorrow
evening, I’m going to give it back to
them."

Mr. Hindus has been a frequent
writer for magazines of the English
speaking world. A contribution to the
February Asia, entitled “GipSy Twl<
light,” describes a personal visit to
a gipsy camp in the land of the Vol-
ga.

Nomads of Volga Shown

The utter alienness to these horse-
trading nomads of the settled life,
which the soviet government is trying

- to teach them, is pictured. The situ-
ation is ameliorated by the fact that
with this race, as with other minor—
ities, the soviet government is work—
ing through representatives of the
people in question, ,

Books are written for them in their
tongue, even though it never before
has been a written language. A. few
isolated gipsles have notably devoted
time and resources to teaching their
reluctant people the principles of
cooperative farming.

Athletics Topic
at Open Forum

College to Reach Conclusion

by Professor, Student
Talks in Chapel

Intramural and varsity athletics
were discussed at the second all-col-
lege assembly in Herrick chapel Mon-
day morning. Carleton Humphrey,
president of the council of house
lchairman, presided.

The relative importance and merit
of both intramural and varsity ath-
letics were outlined, as well as the
relation of athletics to scholarship.
Toward the close of the meeting the
business side of athletics was intros
duced, but time did not permit its
development. Since women’s athlete
ics have not created any problems,
the meeting centered about athletics
for men.

The suggestion that a conclusion be
drawn as to the results of the assem»
biies was met by the announcement
that a faculty member and a student
would each take charge of a chapel
for that purpose.
