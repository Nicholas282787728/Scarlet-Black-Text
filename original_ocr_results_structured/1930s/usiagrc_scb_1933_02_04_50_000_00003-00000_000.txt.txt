THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

 

Now what’s wrong with the Grhuiell
college basketball team?.. This ques-
tion has mted quite a range of dis-
cussion on the campus, and in Wedc
hesdcy's Scarlet and Black, there ap»
peared a letter, represeiitntire in some
degree to the feeling of the student
body, demanding an explanation tor
the poor showing of the (elm-l so for
lh'u season.

i

To prove that they are not going to
remain at the bottom of the Missouri
Valley conference standings a crippled
Pioneer team scored an upset over
the clever Oklahoma A and M. quin—
tet here Thursday. And, then, to
‘show that it was not merely a lucky
accident, it turned right around and
did the same thing the following night.
In each game, the Grinneil team start-
ed out ahead, and were never forced
to relinquish their lead.

How is their improved shou-ing exl
piained? a number of things are
responsible in a general way. For
one thing, there was an improved, al-
though not altogether remedied, spirit
of cooperation among the squad men}
bers. secondly, the team 'Wns better
directed'fmm the floor. That is, in-
stead of trying on Work the some play

ing to another of Coach Truesdale-s
complicated formﬁons,, the Pioneer
team threw a variety of bewildering
plays at the Cowboys all at once. mix.

what was coming next.

More important, however, than
either Of these was the improved de-
fensive showing of the team. Con-
sciously or unconsciously, the men
concentrated on stopping the fast-
breaking, quick—thinking Aggie team,
which employs a confusing system
'0! blocks. Instead of Santi being
forced to carry the burden of the de-
fense alone, there was Menus back
breaking up plays with the same
alertness as Santi himself. And in-
stead of leaving it to the guards to
do all the work, Duncan, Mason,
Phelps, and the others took turns at
stopping plays before they got start-
ed. Instead bf finding only one man
in their path when they began their
fast breaks down the floor, the Aggies
found two or three.

Where the opposing guards had
usually rung up several baskets each

game, Mason and Duncan guarded so
effectively that in the two games, only
