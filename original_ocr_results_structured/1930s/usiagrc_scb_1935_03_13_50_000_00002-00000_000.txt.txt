TRAINING FOR PUBLIC SERVICE

The death of Oliver Wendell Holmes brought
to a termination a long and honorable career of
public service. Justice Holmes served 20 years
as a member of me Massachusetts Supreme Court
and 30 ycars as a member of the Supreme Court
of the United States. There he grew famous
for his liberal thought, for the clarity and grace
of his expression and for the vigor with which
he dissented from the opinions of a c'onservative
majority. ‘

The career of Mr. Holmes should serve as an
illustration of the opportunities and rewards of
a life dedicated to public service. College stu-
dents today hear much about careers in business,
in medicine, in law, and in many other pursuits,
but mention of a career in government is rarely
if ever heard. Political careers in these days
seem to be limited to professional politicians and
to men who have been a failure at everything else,

It has been demonstrated time and again in
the past at great expense to the taxpayers that
the offices of our government have been filled
for the Iflbst part 'with men who, because of ignor- _
ance, dishonesty, or inexperience, were uﬁsuited
to their jobs. This has not been true in all cas-
es of course, but it cannot be disputed that honest
and intelligent men have have been the exception
rather that the rule in public office.

The very nature of modern government has
made it important that well»trained and compel-
ent men be employed, The high degree of Spec~
ialization that has gone on in government recently
has opened up extensive fields of work to men
and women of expert knowledge. It is in train—
ing students for‘ government careers that the col—
‘ gas and universities of our nation can lay the
l oulid worlt for better government. England

5 had a long and highly successful experience

ling her young en for civic life, and her

c ’s haw been ‘ iilul in producing a highly

competent Class of trained officials. The British

Civil Service, is often—and Very justlyiclied
n, for its excellence.

,, More emphasis should be placed in college
on the training of students for public service.
Special four-year programs might be mapped out. '
including those courses which would best pre-
pare students for different types of government
activity. Grinnell has made a start along the
line of qualifying her students, for government
work. Two of her graduates now hold high
position: in the national government. To be-
come a pioneer in the field of training men and
women for public service would be an achievee
ment entirely worthy of Grinnell.

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

SURVEY OF TRADITIONS

A number of schools have of late been con—
ducting comprehensive surveys or their campus
customs in an effort to preserve worthy tradi-
tions and definitely abolish those which have
outgrown their usefulness. Such a step might
not be inappropriate here at Grinnell,

Any college having as long a history behind
it as Grinnell is bound to have quite an accumula-
tion of traditions. Some of them serve to indict-
the school distinctive, to set it apart from :
other colleges and provide a colorful and llIlL’l’r
esting background for life on the c llpur,
Others, however, are merely relics of another
period in which social conditions and custol
were very different from those ol the pr call
which contribute nothing of value lo the mill
and could advantageously be abolished, once
for all.

At present there are few Grinnell traditions
which are wholeheartedly observed. Even those
which should be preserved are in danger of e
tinction because they are not distinguished i
certain other, obsolete customs which have lolly,
outlived their purpose and remain on the Campl“
merely because of the human tendency to cullcc:
rubbish from other days.

A complete study of Grinnell traditions
would not amiss, and would even justiiy the
assignment of an upperclass SRE student to row
search along this line. There are scores oi
more or less vague traditions extant on the cam-
pus; the purpose of many and the sources of
practically all are lorgottcn, and in a many cases
no one even knows just exactly what the exact
tradition is.

Traditions contribute much to that indeﬁn»
able atmosphere called “school spirit," and should
be retained even though they fulfill no other
purpose. When traditions crumble, the school
loses something that cannot be regained. It be—
comes nothing more than an educational institu»
tionia, worthy function, but not the only one a
college should fulfill. thn the old-timers rce
call fondly the “good old days,” and claim that
the modern collegian is missing much of the fun of
college, his charge can be traced to the disappear-
ance of traditions which give the students a feel»
ing of closer relationship and a greater sense of
loyalty than could be developed in a traditionless
atmosphere.

Grninell would proﬁt very definitely if its
collection of traditions were subjected to a close
inspection. Those which still contribute to the
campus life should be polished up an given their
rightful place, while those that are obsolete should
be junked to enhance the value of those retained.

A FUTILE GESTURE

A number of young people's movements, of
which the only one represented on the Grinnell
campus is the League for Industrial Democracy,
are hoping to organize a nation—wid iwallmut of
college students on April 12 as an anti—war
demonstration.

The walkout is supposed to take place
throughout the country at 11 a. m. (in the desig-
nated day, and the strike is to last for one hour,
While the general aim of the demonstration is
admirable enough, it is hard to understand just
what its instigators hope to accomplish by such
an action.

The difficulty is that apparently the promot-
ers of the protest action do not a ore, no tllai

concrete results? Nothing, very likely; so why go
through the motions? Demonstrations ion the soap

powers-that~be on the armaments policy and sim-

number aimed at) play hockey from their classes
in behalf of world peace. If the students backing
the demonstration wish to express their hate for
war, they should be able to find a much more ap—
propriate and effective means of doing so,
