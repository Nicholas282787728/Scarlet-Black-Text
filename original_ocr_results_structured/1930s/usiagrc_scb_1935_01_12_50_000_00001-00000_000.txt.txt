our technique, admirable phrasing, en.
thusiasm in and for his art, and re.
markable mental balance in the mat.
ter of dynamics"

his two appearances with the Chicago

would not depart until he had played
two movements of the Bach Suite in
G for ’cello unaccompanied.

At his concert here Mr. Feuermann
will play three sonatas for ’cello and

New Journalism

Major Receives
Official Approval

As the result of action taken by the
Grinnell College faculty at a meeting
held Tuesday afternoon, journalism has
been added to the school curriculum as
a major course. Information Concern.
ing the new course was made public
yestelday by Herschel M. Colbert, as.
sistant professor oi journalism.

Major requirements will include 24
hours of journalism and 40 hours of
social sciences. The latter must be
distributed as follows: two courses
each in history, economics, and political
science; and at least one course each in
history oi philosophy, and philosophy
or psychology.

“The requirements, which upon irrst
glance appear very strict, still leave
the students 29 to 31 hours of purely
elective courses,” Mr. Colbert stated,
asserting that they compare very
closely with those of other journalism
departments, and that they were drawn
up to place journalism training at
Grinncll on a par with that required
by the American Association of Schools
and Colleges oi Journalism.

Thirty hours
will be offered.
