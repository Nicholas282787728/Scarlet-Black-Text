Lantern Discusses
Campus Smoking

At the regular semi-monthly meet-
ing of Lantern last Wednesday eve-
ning in Langan hall clubrcom, the
organization discussed two matters
brought to its attention, namely,
noise in .the lower hall of A. R. H.
between classes, and smoking by
groups at the entrances of various
campus buildings. After some dis»
cussion, the organization took action
as follows and recommends that the
student body cooperate in helping to
change existing conditions:

First, there have been complaints
from students and professors about
the noise in the lower hall of A. R. H.
caused by students while waiting for
classes to convene. If the waiting
students would refrain from singing,
whistling, loud talking and laughing
while in A, R. H. the classes in ses<
sion could get full beneﬁt from their
alloted time. Lantern urges that the
students waiting for classes should
henceforth cooperate in bettering
this condition.

Second, it is felt that the effect on
passerS—by of groups of smokers
clustered about the entrances of the
various buildings is not good. Lan—
tern believes that , if the smoking
were decentralized the impression on
the visitor would be improved.

high rankings were awarded arch-
itecture students of the Oklahoma

achieved the well-nigh impossible

combination of clean playing and
close guarding. Her consistent, ﬁne
playing this season has been a beau-
tiful demonstration of the guard
game at its best. Mary Doris Carp-
ente a senior. shares the 'guard
posi on honors for her speed and
hard ﬁghting.
Coggesholl Consistent.

Roberta Vance, sophomore, and
Kate Coggesball. junior, are paired
as forwards in the second team rat—
ing. Both are consistent players and
dead shots. Alberta Curtis, a juni-
or, has been outstanding at center
for her hard ﬁghting every minute of
play. and her remarkably steady per-
formance throughout the season.
Marjorie Wilder, senior captain, takes
deserved honors as running center
for her speed and reliability.

Elsie Jensen, the only freshman to
win an SJHQIIad position, has played
an outstanding guard game all sea»
son and only stiff competition keeps
her from getting a ﬁrst team berth.
Real basketball ability and unlimited
ﬁght have enabled her to keep op-
ponents scores to a minimum.
Loretta Mutersbaugh, senior veteran,
also wins deserved mention for. her
dependable, all-around game at gu-
ard.
