on the necessity ot "rcvaluating our
spiritual eye" to recognize the irn.
portanco oi the church in the salva.

"Love links us together and is the
salvant of all world problentsﬂhestat.
ed, and pointed out that tho ovii
lound in the world is due to the re.
lusal of man to submit his will to God.

In speaking of ideals, the Rev. Mr.
Longley said that unless one br
them down to earth to thc practical
things in lite, they are valuelcss. For
“our job is to make kingdoms of this

greater now than ever before, yet the
world is also better prepared than ever
before. “There has been a lowering
of standards," he continued. "It we
have principles we should announcc
themimake them known."

He commended the present system
ot education except tor the tact that
in it, religion is almost entirely lctt
out, and, according to the speaker, re.
ligion is fundamenLdl to good society.
