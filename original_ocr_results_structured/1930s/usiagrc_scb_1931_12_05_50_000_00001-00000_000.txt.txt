Valley Gridders
AboutiEven With
Outside Teams

Missouri Valley conference football
teams Won 17, lost 15 and tied one of
their non—conference games during
the 1931 season.

Oklahoma A. a M. and Grinnell
did the best work in hanging up this
record. The Aggies won six games,
lost three and tied one. Grinnell took
four and dropped but a single can-
test.

Drake, champions of the Valley,
did not fare so well outside of the
conference and lost four games While
winning only three. Creighton won
two and lost three While the lucklcss
Washington Bears’ only two victories
this year were over non-conference
foes, although they lost foul: times to
foreign teams.

As was the case in 1930, Missouri
Valley teams again broke even with
Big Six rivals. Drake whipped Iowa
State in a hard battle but lost to
Missouri. The Oklahoma Aggics
downed Kansas but the Jayhawkers,
in turn, trounced Washington. The
Aggies and Oklahoma struggled to
a 010 tie in their annual battle.

Norman Flisier will portray the
port of Boauerges, the firey labor
leader of the British cabinet in
Bernard Shaw‘s comedy, “The
Apple (XII-t” which will be present-
ed in the high school auditorium
Tuesday night.

Mme. Bogia Horska Offers Contrast
' to Average Among Concert Singers

Mine Bogia Horska, Czcch recltal~

here Friday evening, Dec. 11, from
advance reports Will offer a con-

play,

Mme. Horska has not only sung
leading roles in the Berlin and Vienna
Staatsopers, but she has also played
in straight dramatic productions and
has studied the dance. She uses all of
these gifts in her solo recitals.

Few Expollcnts

"It is truly remarkable how few
have been the important exponents of
the intimate art of the chanson," says
David E. Peck. chairman of the de—
partment of music here. “True, the
line between the genuine recital art—
ist and what we have come to call
the diseuse should not be great.

“Such artists as Julia Culp, Elena
Gerhardt, Esther Dale, Eva Gautier,
Povla Frijsch, Chaliapin, and John
Goss, while known as concert artists,
actually include a great deal of dram.
atic interpretation in their recitals.
There is no word to describe these
artists, to distinguish them from the
operatic artists who occasionally give
concerts, and yet, they work in an
entirely different medium. Possibly
they may best be described as intere

itories.

House Councilmen to Meel
With Chairmen on Dec. 14

House council members from all
buildings of the men's dormitories
will meet with the council of house
chairmen in the Rawson hall club-
room Dec, 14.

ferent types of sports different
standards of sportsmanship are up-
held. He cited the fact that football
and tennis differ widely in objectives
and hence the sportsmanship stand-
ards differ widely. He said that one
should play the game as hard as he
can, but play it clean and with a
friendly attitude toward his oppon-
ents.
Citizenship Valuable

Mr. Baumann spoke of citizenship
as the highest office anyone can hold,
and defined it as on "each for all and
all for each" attitude in the mind of
the individual. He suggested that the
TrirSllip organization have a defin-
ito policy toward local and national
affairs.

The TriShrp is a new organization
within the Young Men’s Christian
association made up of men who
have shown a definite interest in the
work or the group. The body will
meet every Thursday,

Of those who have attempted to
emphasize the dramatic there have
been only Yvette Gudbert, Yvonne
George, David Bisphan, Victor Chen-
kin. Raquel Meller, Ruth Draper, and
Fanny Brice.

Mme. Horska, without the aid of
costume or stage set, projects a
dramatic episode through the medium
of the song, the spoken word. and
the use of her body. Her program is
a novelty to American audiences.

Last Recital

She received her musical education
from Professor Paul Emmerich, Ag-
ria Argeni, Felicia Kaszowska
(teacher of Lotta Lehman), and
Mme. Emmy Destinn.

Her appearance in Grinnell will be
the last artist’s recital in Grinnell be-
fore -the Christmas holidays. Semes»

Shaw F lays

‘Democracy’

‘Apple Cart’

Calls it Humbug

Preface to

“Democracy," says Bernard Shaw
in his preface to “The Apple Cart,"
“is government of the people and for
the people. Government by the people
is not and never can be a reality: it
is only a cry by which demagogues
humbug us into voting for them."
Thus Mr. Shaw explains his apparent
rightabout—face from democracy to
royalty in his recent play “The
Apple Cart," which is to be presented
Tuesday. Dec. 3, in the high school
auditorium under the sponsorship of
the National Collegiate Players.

In brief, "The Apple Cart" is a
satirical comedy, the scene laid on
years in the future, in which a King
defeats an attempt by his popularly
elected Prime Minister to deprive him
of the right to influence public opin-
ion through the press and the plat-
form, and to reduce him to a mere
figorchead. Mr. Shaw explains that
in conflicts between monarchs and
popular ministers, the monarchs win
every time when personal ability and
good sense are at all equally divided.
In “The Apple Cart" this equality
is assumed, thereby heightening the
suspense and the final outcome of the
political duel.

The role of King Magnus of Eng-
land will be taken by Boyd Irwin,
English actor. “The Apple Cart" is
to he presented only three times in
Iowa: Grinnell, Cedar Falls, and Des
Moines. The company which will ap-
pear in these cities is the orimnal
one which is making its transcontin-
ental tour this season, under the auSr
pices of the New York Theatre Guild.

NUMBER 25

Foerster Says
F ew Authors
Now Creative

Goethe Romanticist, Kept
Classical influence,

Asserts Speaker

“There are more things in heaven
and earth than are dreamed of in
laboratories." Norman Foerster, Dean
of the College of Letters, the Uni-
versity of lowa, declared in his lec»
ture on “Goethe and Humane Let-
ters Today," given last night in Her-
rick chapel. \

Mr. Foerster Said that today Writ—
el's are scientists, not humanists. “The
important thing is to bring the pres—
ent and the past together in a really
creative way. With the exception of
Willa Gather and Thornton Wilder.
this is not done by present day Wﬁt<
ers. There is an excess of cxtempor—
aneous spirit, which we may have ac-
quired from science.

Remembered Classics

“In his study of S ‘ence, Goethe es-
caped from romanti m, but did not
wipe out the Greek influence. Nor
did he assert that law for man is the
same as law for things. In dealing
with animals he used naturallsm;
with man, humanism. To picture man
as animal and man as part nature
and nothing more is a model'nistic
doctrine.”

Mr. Foerster asserted that Goethe’s
central effort was to picture man's
humanism, and that man is man's
best study. Goethe, he explained, en-
(leavorecl to reproduce all the truth
about man; James Joyce, on the oth~
cr hand, has made an experimental
exploitation about one truth about
man which is excentral or eccentric,

Pelletl‘ated Realities

“A third thing which Goths pur-
posed to do," continued Mt. Foerster,
"was to penetrate the reality lying
beneath our inherited ideals. Mencken
concentrates on the influence of tem-
peramental, environmental, and sen -
mental.

“In the fourth place he perceived
that men and women need not ‘get on
the band Wagon,‘ A man may follow
a, will led by intelligence. Let a man
possess 3 noble soul and live a. noble
life to be a true writer.

Developed Ideas

“In the fifth place Goethe had a
desire to carry on and develop the
great creative ideas of the pastr The
modernistic View is to create from
the new ideas. Goethe stressed study
of the ancients rather than contem-
porary man, It is the individual who
teaches truth, not the age.”

“For myself," Mr. Foerster declar»
ed, "I prefer to be like Goethe. some
men think they owe everything to
themselves. There must be knowledge
of knowledge in science for experi—
ment, 3nd in literature there must he
knowledge of past masters."

Mr. Foerster said that Goethe re-
garded himself as at Citizen of the

Fresh Favored
to Win Crown
in Cage Meet

Freshman basketball men ruled as
favorites to annex the interelsss baa-
ketball crown today as a result of
their victory over the junior cagers
Friday 22 to 14. The 1933 basket

led the yearlings in a second half
rally which decided the game.

The seniors lost to the sophomores
Friday in a rough game, 18 to 12. The
losers took an early lead but were
unable to hold it.
