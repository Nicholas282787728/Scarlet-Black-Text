PLAN THIS HOMECOMING

Homecoming. though late this year, is only two weeks away.
Again this year the campus will be the goal of alumni during that
weekend.

In other years they have returned ’to find that few if any plans
have been for their entertainment. They come back eager to see
again the scenes of their college days and meet their friends. They
walk into a hall and announce that they once lived there, upon which
the undergraduates say words to the effect of “that’s nice, pleased
to meet you, I've got to go now, I'll see you later." and rush off
leaving the alumnus to his own devices.

Now is the time for us to make plans which will keep this sort
of thing from happening again, Perhaps certain students could be
delegated to act as hosts to the visitor House officers could plan
to let the alumni take part in the activ ies of the halls and make

each one feel like he is “one of the boys."
THE EDITORIAL BOARD

THE TEACHERS MAKEﬁEmGEA

Tuesday morning's Des Moines Register announces that the
teachers of iowa plan to seek a statewide pe sion law. (As the law
now stands it is effective only when an indi idual city wants it so)
Further, they ask that they he included in the federal Social Security
act, -

It seems to us that the teachers are overstepping their rightful
claims. Pensions have been unreasonable enough, but the added social
security income is far beyond any justification.

Though the argument may be advanced that teachers are public
servants, that they are more nearly connected with the advancement
of civilization and the maintenance of social welfare than any other
group, this is still not argument enough to justify a pension half of
which comes from the public treasurer.

Medical men, lawyers, and those in many other professions are
just as much public servants as are the teachers and yet there is no
provision for pcnsioning them, There are perhaps fewer cases of
spectacularly high salaries in the teaching profession yet, considering
the time put in, the pay is comparatively good, '

There is no coercion on the part of the government to make
certain people enter the teaching profession~all do it of their own
free-will, Therefore, there is no more public obligation to take care
of them in their old age than there is to take care of anyone else,

Admittedly the teachers have a- right to the federal social se~
curity payments when they meet the requirements, but only thus far
should they be considered public charges
