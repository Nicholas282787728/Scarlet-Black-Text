doubtless, like an army, travels on
its stomach, but what a stomach!"

Taking a side glance at “the luv

rluence of the stomach on the hll-l

man mini, Dr. T. Wingate Todd,
otanomist at Western Reserve unlr
tiersity's school of medicine laSt
week took stock of the results oi
his nearly 12 years oi research on
the human stomach.

He chose Samuel Johnson os a
good example, stating that "there
is no doubt at all of Johnson's
chronic indigestion and the result-
ant cantankerous disposition with
which there goes a brilliance of
imagery and creative thought.

“Benedick's 'qllick wit and
queasy stomach’ (in Shakespeare's
‘Much Ado About Nothing') re—
minds us of the indebtedness of
both literature and science to iridi-
gestion.

“Would Darwin have framed the
theory of evolution had it not been
for the imagery created by his
chronic indigestion?

“Would Conrad have written his
stories had the facts oi his experi-
ence not been sharpened and amp-
llﬁed by nervous dyspepsia?

“How much of Poe's tales of
mystery and imagination were due
to indigestion, and how much to
alcohol?"

Scientifically speaking, Dr. Todd
reported that 800 experiments on
students had revealed that emo-
tional states reduce the stomachs
gastric waves of contraction and
cause prolonged closure of its out-
let.
