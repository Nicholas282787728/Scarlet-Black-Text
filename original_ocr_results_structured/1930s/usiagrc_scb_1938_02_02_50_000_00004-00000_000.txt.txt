T0 RECOGNIZE SENIOR ACHIEVEMENTS

The new senior men’s honorary society,
plans for which have been approved by the
faculty, will without question fill a much
needed place in the life of Grinnell college.

It is an unfortunte fact that there is not
a national honorary society for men which
compares with Mortar Board, women’s
honorary society.

This new organization, while not of
national scope, will, however, be an effective
means of recognizing the scholarship and
outstanding service of senior men as such
achievements Should be recognized,

The plans so far released indicate that the
group will also serve a useful purpose in the
promotion of worthwhile campus projects
and in providing for recognition of students
in other classes who are and will perform
services for the school.

REAFFIRMING ﬂ:
OPEN noon POLICY

Some months ago we suggested in these
columns that it would be advantageous if
both doors of buildings with double doors
would be opened, mentioning particularly
those of the chapel and the Alumni Recita-
tion halll

To date, no action has been taken on this
suggestion, nor, on the other hand, has any-
one given us a valid reason for locking one
of the doors. We have assumed that per—
haps the cold weather had something to do
with the state of affairs and so have not
pressed the point. Now, however, spring
is rapidly approaching so we beg leave to
offer, with malice toward none and the con-
venience of all at heart, this simple sug—
gestion: lets have a real open door policy
with both doors unlocked.

NEW EXAM PLAT
UNDER THE MICROSCOPE

The new examination plan proposed
several weeks ago by three seniors has met
with faculty approval to the extent that
members have been asked to submit the
plan to their classes for a vote with the
provision that it may be applied wherever
75 per cent of the students concur with the
professor and the curriculum committee in
approving the plan.

Use of the plan, then, is left largely to
the discretion of the students In line with
its policy of serving the students, the
Scarlet and Black presents here a short
summary of the good and bad features of

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

the plan to guide you ill voting.

In its essence, the plan provides for
numerous unannounced quizzes in place of
the customary hour examinations and the
three hour final, Such quizzes obviously
make necessz y careful and thorough daily
preparation Such piepalation is unques-
tionably the mom valuable so far as leain-
ing the subject is concemed The tests
themselves aid in crystalizing the mass of
material into 2| readily useable form, Then
there would be an advantage in having a
number of grades to average for the course
grader

At the same time, a drop quiz might be
given at any time over any portion of the
work of the semester or year, necesitating
constant knowledge equal to that usually
only achieved by protracted review for a
final. For certain courses requi lug broad.
general knowledge, drawn from a back-
ground of a full semester, the plan would
not be feasible, and students who find re-
view invaluable would be at a disadvantage
under the proposed system,

WHERE THE TALL CORN GROWS

We recently chanced to read an article in
one of the small daily papers in the State
which brought out some interesting, and to
us at least, hitherto unknown facts about
the state of Iowa.

For example,_we found that only two and
one-half per cent of the population of Iowa
is unemployed, that during the last year the
average return on capital invested in Iowa
farm land was 11.8 per cent and that one-
fourth of the grade A farm land in the
United States was located in Iowa.

These, to mention only a few, are facts
often forgotten by the average Iowan when
others disparage his home state or when he
himself begins to feel that he has outgrown
the farm and the state which typifies farm—
ing to the average metropolitan citizenl

Iowa is after all a pretty good state, and
we might remember, as college students in
this state, though we may come from
others, that Iowa still has the highest per-
cent of literacy among its inhabitants of any
state in the union.

7G——
PHILOSOPHY FOR THE
AVERAGE STUDENT

Keprlnted [mm the Daily Nortlrwesmrn.

The shortest distance between two points
is often a university course between registra»
tion and a grade. This shortest distance
is usually traveled by collecting a certain
assigned pile of data, hitching it together
by a technical jargon and placing it on
exhibition at certain definite times, notably
that of final examinations. Occasionally ill
this grim struggle certain students appear
who actually are attempting to get an
education, One of the manifest differences
between these students and the general run
is that the really successful student has
the faculty to abstract, systematize and
generalize.

This may be the result of natural interest
of the more gifted stlldellt in the courses
they are taking which leads them to think
over the Subject matter, relate it to general
principles and draw conclusions which
henceforth they use ill their own thinking.
Perhaps they have stumbled onto some
courses which have been a help to them

To the average student who is not par-
ticularly interested in attempting abstract
thinking for himself we wollld recommend a
course or two ill philosophy. The basic as—
sumptions upon which our thought rests and
the logical methods which must be employed
to discover truth, or relative truth, might be
revealed They would learn to regard ma-
terial presented with a skeptical and inquir-
ing eye, and to relate it to the more funda-
mental assumptions. The somewhat neglect-
ed department of philosophy would probably
work a revolution on undergraduate
thinking if it had access to the minds of
large numbers of students and could be

systematically organized to meet problems.

 

DORIC

Well, Doric has changed hands
ang. They tell that the last ed-
itor got a Ilaugnail and couldn’t
type out his copy. I hope my old
stamp mill is more gentle. Any—
way. we'll try to carry on the
traditions of this column as we
see them. More speciﬁcally, the
column Will consist of the three
D’sﬁDirt, Dope and Dither.

Sometimes it seems one student
Council knows the student mind
and other times not. First they
tell us not to cheat and put us on
our honor. Then, when we come
to exams with our honor polished
bright and clean, they say: “Put
your cribs harem» Naturally we
get maul. Do they think we are
going to sully our good names by
Lhrowlng our cribs m the basket
right in front of everybody?
Should say not!

Lambo certainly knows where
his own strength lies. Instead of
wasting all that air, he's sailing
kites with it now. It seems kind
of silly of him to send messages
up the string thoughihc must
know they can hear him up there.
However, Jack is learning. They
tell us he keeps his mouth closed
when he swims.

Maybe it's a wrong guess, but
if you watch closely 1 think you'll
agree that the NolsonAI-laie perr
ennai is about to bloom again.
Let's hope it’s a sign of an early
Spring.

The Nichoisvo‘Neil rormulce is

all their odd pennies (O’Neil is

thing more symbolical of true
