Razz Dinner

Tickets
Sell Rapidly

Early Check-Up Reports
More Than iOne-Third
of Total Sold

More than one-third of the ticks
ets available for the annual jour-
nalists’ roasting session Wednes-
day night in the quadrangle dining
room were sold by noon today, ac
cording to a hurried check-up
made by members of the ticket
selling committee.

Only 340 seats will be available
in the quadrangle dining room for
the night of the dinner and roast,
ing session because of the erection
of a large stage at the south end
of the room, according to an an»
nouncement by Max w. Hunn,
president of Sigma Delta Chi, and
head of the general committee on
arrangements.

Build Large Stage

"In order to properly stage oilr
gridiron roasting session, we have
found it necessary to remove Six
tables from‘the dining loom, thus
reducing the seating capacity from
400 to 340. We cannot possibly
seat more than 340 persons in the
room, and we are forced to limit
our ticket sales to that number."
he declared.

The gridiron scenes this year
will take the form of a number of
interviews with st. Peter, who will
take the place of the traditional
gridmaster. various members of
the faculty and the student body
will be interviewed and their cre-
dentials to heaven or hell exam-
ined. St. Peter will direct them to
the proper places for their talents.

Beatty Releases
Report of Illness
of Clark Freshman

Condition of Robert Knepper,
Clark freshman from Wilmette,
111.. now in the Community hosplr
tal, was reported as being imr
proved today in a statement issued
by Shelton L. Beatty, dean of
men.

Dean Beatty when questioned
concerning the illness of Mr.
Knepper, who was taken to the
hospital a week ago because of an
attack of the flu, made the follow-
ing statement:

“After consultation with Dr. 0,
F. Parish, attending physician. I
am authorized to say that Robert
Knepper, now -at the Community
hospital where he was taken while
suffering from influenza, appears
to have a kind of encephalitis, pus»
sibly of influenzal type.

"After a more restful night, he
is better today, and his condition
gives us reason to believe that he
has passed the crisis of his illness.

“Dr, Parish is being assisted in
the diagnosis by Dr. Fred Moore,
Des Moines specialist. Dr. Parish
told me that there is no need for
students to be alarmed, and that
there is no special precautionary
measure that can be taken,” Dean
Beatty stated.

Dean Beatty‘s statement was is»
sued as the result of rumors ab
tributing Knepper’s illness to Spi»
nal meningitis or sleeping sick-
ness. Final diagnosis of the illness
will not be available until after
laboratory tests are finished.

Track Team
to Meet Iowa

Coach Doubts Chances
of Winning Opener

Hopes for winning the opening
track meet of the year with Iowa,
Thursday, are very slim, according
to Track Coach G. Lester Duke,
"1 don't entertain any possibility
of beating Iowa," he said, “as we
haven't had the practice facilities
that Iowa possesses, and it will
take two or three meets before
most of our boys will have gained
the experience that comes from
stiff competition."

“I believe that we can place in
the hurdles. quarter mile, half
mile, two mile. and possibly the
mile and the sprints. We have a
chance for first in the pole vault
and the broad jump,” he explained.

Men upon whom Duke will de-
pend, and the events in which they
will compete include: Preston Ev-
ans, Arnold Hagan, Don Arnold,
Lynn Schlotterbeck, William Mile
lcr, William Balikie, George
Dwelle, Harold Seeger, Roy Jen-
son and Robert Hagan in the dis-
tance and middlerdistance events;
Roger Nelson and Joe Nichols in
the pole vault; Paul Baichly, Fred
Luther, and Burke Powers in the
hurdles; Rolfe Warner, Ted Applee
qiiist and Robert Cranny in the
sprints; Burke Powers in the
broad-jump; and Bill Sampson in
the field events.

they tangle with the powerful Jay
aggregation for the second time
this season.

Creighton, already once victor}
ous this season over the Grinnel-
lians by 8. margin of 51-28, Will
probably enter the game slight
favorites to win, although Grin-
hell’s rapidly improving team may
find the advantage of playing on
the home floor more than enough
to offset the Creighton paper su—
periority.

Pleased With Progress

Coach John C. Trueedaie ex-
pressed pleasure with the new life
shown by members of the start-
ing five in their game with Wash—
ington last Saturday. “’I'he boys
showed a lot of improvement.” he
declared. However, the Pioneer
mentor is making no predictions
of victory.

Grinuell will 'be faced with the
problem of scoring against the
zone or loose mngtOrman defense
which Creighton will employ.
Against teams that have used
these defensive tactics. the Plo-
neers have been unable to score
consistently, and drills last night
were devoted to the development
of Grinnell scoiing tactics against
such defenses.
