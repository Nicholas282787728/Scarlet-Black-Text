ONCE UPON A TIME
NOT many hours ago a

shopper girl prowled
around Santa’s headquarters
for smart gifts located at
TALBOTT'S PHARMACY.
She found everything that her
heart could desire! Listen to
her story! Diaries! I've
never seen such goodlooking
ones before. All lovely leath-
er and bound in such a mod-
ern attractive way. There
were five year “line a day"
ones with lock and key so the
little secrets would be such
even with little brother
around: These were all in
clever gift boxes —— just the
gift for that particular
friend.

AND SAY:

YOU should see the station-

ery. Darling Christmas
notes decorated with attrac-
tive designs in the Christmas
colors. You'll surely need
some new real good looking
stationery for the thank-you
letters. And if you are well
providedﬁwhut about a pres
ent of stationery, sounds old 7
Well. this is so chic in the
smart, modemistically decor-
ated boxes that you couldn't
make a mistake.

ALWAYS GOOD.

ARE the plaques: TAL-

BUTTS have reecived
some new ones. They were
made in England and are of
a beautiful creamy color.
The other colors are so warm
and lovely—one feels that he
just must have one. There is
a plaque there for every kind
they have “The Old Whaler",
of personifor the boat lover
“Beethoven" for the musician
and so on. Include a plaque
for someone on your list.

Tolbott Shopper

HAVE You
EEN looking for a. cute
inexpensive little gift?
You will find just the thing
that you want here. They
have so many smart novelties
that are just right: Elea
phants, ash trays bedecked
with little animals, cedar
lined cigarette boxes, book
ends, playing cards — and
have you seen the discus
type? Tm are many ,.::
type? There are many more
things too that I can’t name
now. You go down and ex-
plore for yourself.

PERFUME
you will never know how
many kinds of perfumes
there are until you go down
and look them overll Spicy
ones, soft, flattery fragrant
ones. some the very breath
or flowers. Coty’s, Elizabeth
Arden's, Yo-rdley's are .all
there in many different
odors. Have you tried Bond
Street, by Yardley, or Cup<
id‘s Breath, or Toujour Moi?
I might go on naming them
indefinitely A but names
mean so little. Why no go
down and look them all over
for yourself. You'll find the
rig/at one for yourselfiand I
know you will add perfume
to your gift list for one of the
college chums.

ONCE
COSMETICS were thought
luxuries—but we of today
know that they are one of
the primary necessities! Have
you seen the Gentlemen
package sets? Yardley’s and
Houbigant have them now.
And then there are the sets
for the ladies too. Besides
the sets you will find many
many kinds of bath salts,
soap in all sizes, colors, and
scents. One awfully cute
thing was the “floating hath
bowl"7e, Yardley creation.
Soap in a little wooden howl
that will float in the bath.
And then there are the com—
pacts. New ones in all sizes,
shapes, and colors

CHRISTMAS CARDS .

RE a necessity now—ev-

eryone sends them'! Here
you will find exactly the
cards you are looking for.
They have just the right
verses, and are designed ex—
actly the way you would
want to if you were an art-
istll Some are more dignified
having beautiful etchings.
And then there are special
ones for the various mem—
bers of the family. You will
need some of the Christmas
gift Wrappings that they
have too. Beautiful paper,
have you tried the cello-
phone?7g\)rgeous seals, and
just the right kind of tying
ribbon.

OF COURSE
OME book lover is included
on your list. Have you
seen all the books in TAL-
BOTT’S? I know that you
will find just the one you are
looking for. No need to have
to order it and run the risk
of not having it arrive in
time! !! Most of the hooks are
reasonably priced at a dollar
shocks that formerly you
would have paid five for.
Take a look.

AND THEN

you, I know have a little

brother or sister — and
I'll wager that you are
searching in Vain for the gift
for each. I have good news
for you. Right here in this
same place you will find some
darling books that they
would love. Books for chil-
dren of all ages. And I saw
some games too—it the book
isn’t enough why not supple—
ment it with a clever game?

WHEWl

IT IS usually very hard to

find the gift that big bro-
ther would he sure to like.
They have a habit of being no
particular, hut I saw some
leather goods in at TAL-
BOTT'S that I am sure he
zould find no fault with. some
very good looking fitted
travel sets—one in a zipper
bagi And then of course
there are the less expensive
sets of bill folds and key
oases. And then my little
prowling around was over.
You agree with me now that
this is truly the headquarters
for Santa—don’t you? Let's
go down now!
