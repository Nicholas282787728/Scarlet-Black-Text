CATASTROPHE IN EUROPE?

Again the eyes of the world are on Germany.
Again there is contusion of thought and conflict
between hope and fear, an uneasy feeling that
perhaps the long-predicted “nest war” is drawing
closer. And again the question is asked, “What
of America?”

Germany’s shocking renunciation of the Ver—
sailles treaty should cause thought if it causes
resentment or fear, How many of those who
cry against this “outrage" remember that it was
the allies who first broke the treaty? Most of
us forget that Germany’s disarmament was as~
sumed as only the first step in a general disarmae
ment by which all nations would reduce their
military machines. This fact was specifically
stated in the treaty of Versailles. Yet every
allied power is more heavily armed than in 1913,
and the increase of the United States is greater
than that of any other. Should we expect Ger-
many to live up to the treaty which we imposed
but refused to follow?

Another interesting observation may be drawn
from Germany’s recent announcement. Eng-
land’s foreign secretary, Sir John Simon, was on
the point of visiting Hitler in Berlin when Eng—
land suddenly published her “White Paper" an-
nouncing a tremendous increase in military forces.
thether or not the publication at just that time
was intended as a threat, we can hardly know;
but that it acted as a threat is certain, and many
rejoiced that in this way Germany would be
brought to terms. , “Frighten your opponent,”
they said, “and he will make concessions." This
is precisely the policy we have followed too per-
sistently: act belligerent, and other nations, being
frightened, will be acquiescent. Unfortunately,
such policies almost never succeed, because na—
tions that are frightened seldom acquiesce; they
arm. That is what happened in Germany. Mil-
itarism was not answered by sweetness and light,
but by counteramilitarism.

That is what will happen in Japan if we try
to frighten her. Naval maneuvers in the Pacific
don‘t pacify the powers they frighten, and they
never will. They breed the militarism which is
their essence.

This article is no defense of Germany’s ac-
tion; we deplore jingoism in the rcich as much
as we deplore it anywhere. But we should carry
on our own shoulders all the blame which is right—
ly ours; we should not be “outraged” by Ger-

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

many, but should understand her. And we
should abandon Oriental policies which lead as
inevitably toward conflict as those now leading
toward catastrophe in Europe. iJ. c.

G
A STEP IN ADVANCE.

Following in the wake of the announcement
by the German government to increase in arm»
aments beyond the limitations of the Versailles
treaty, at least one advance has been taken in tho
opposite direction. The Senate munitions com—
mittcc members yesterday reported administra-
tion approval of a 12—point plan to eliminate war
proﬁts. The plan proposes the levy of an excess»
profits tax on corporations, and an almost ConfiSr
catory tax on the incomes of high salaried
officials.

The legislative scheme suggests conscription,
in war time, of virtually all profits of corpora-
tions, limitation of all individual incomes to
$10,000 and imposition of a tax on all incomes
from 31,000 up. Other measures included man~
ners of assessment, collection and regulation of
war time profits.

Perhaps the most significant thing about the
announcement is the fact that some definite action
on the long discussed Control of munitions profits
has actually been taken. No other government
activity has been given more space in newspapers
and periodicals in the last few months than the
arms investigation. The drafting of the legisla-
tion will no doubt be deferred by the deliberations
in law-making.

The munitions investigation has; then, reach.
ed a climax; and, though the actual legislation
will probably not include such drastic measures
as those suggested by the committee, certainly
a step in the right direction has been taken,

LEGISLATIVE QUIBBLIN G

Members of the Iowa legislature recently took
a well aimed poke at freedom of the press’in
general and The Des Moines Register in particu.
lar when it voted a criticism of that paper for two
“off the record” stories printed last: week,

The news stories referred to actions of some
of the house members while a bill was being con-
sidered on the floor, and declared that “lobbyists
were finding the cost of liquor supplied to legis»
lators higher this session and that the legislators
were always asking for Scotch instead of Bour~
bon.” Among other things, the resolution con-
tended that freedom of the press does not exist in
Des Moines, that the legislators work is mis—
understood and his motives misinterpreted.

But, despite the well worded resolution pre—
pared by the house and by Representative Gus
Alesch, chief exponent of the criticism, the Regis»
ter with a hearty chuckle, disregarded the vote,
carried the story of the resolution in a latter edi
tion and even reprinted the stories that caused
the trouble,

Thus rages the confab between the Iowa
house of representatives and Iowa’s largest news-
paper while Mr. and Mrs. Iowa watch the two
ﬁght over the candy. Such a trivial matter to
take the time of the governing body of the state
seems farcical to say the least. It would appear
that the time spent in putting through the mea-
sure, not to mention the amount of time spent
drafting the resolution, was completely wasted,
No good really was accomplished besides giving
undue publicity to certain state representatives.
The time thus spent in ”quibbling” might well
have been spent to much better advantage.

It would not be our purpose to say the law»
makers have no right to defend themselves against
the “slings and arrows” of outrageous criticism,
but it is, we feel, justifiable to censure them for
their complete waste of time in this highly un-
successful attempt at selfrdefense. ~R. D.

If they continue their aggressiveness it may
be that the self-defense for which nations are
arming will be defense against the internationa-
lionalists and pacifisis,

A lot of folks seem to think that what this
country needs is more ill-natured name calling
and less team work.

VVI'stISin Club Plans
Exclusive Male Revue

MADISON, Wis.—(ACP)7 "All our
girls are men, yet everyonc's a lady,"
used to be the slogan of the Haresloot
club, University of Wisconsin men's
dramatic organization, but now, with
a decision by the directors of the club
to stage an exclusive male revue this
year, it looks as though the slogan will
have to be changed.

For the first time in the history ot
college musical comedy clubs, includ.
ing the Triangle club at Princeton, the
Hasty Pudding club of Harvard, the
Mask and Wig club at the University
of Pennsylvania, the Mimes club of
Michigan and the Black Trials of the
University of Chicago, there will be
no female impersonations in the cast
or chorus.

Prompted by a desire to give the
audiences in thc eight cities which the
club will visit on its 36th annual tour
something entirely different, the club
will present the story of a newspaper
in review form, but there will not be
any husky football players dressed up
as sob sisters. Instcad they will be
“ho—man" reporters.

plans to facilitate those arrangements
by permitting students to take out

our 0]“ LIFE by Myron Brinig.
"Out of Lil‘e" is well named; it is real.
1y a psychological study of intensified
awareness, of a lethargic mind awaken.
ad to terrible sensitiveness. Sam Bag.
got, after 1|) years of married IiIc,
is told by his wife that they are to
have a child. In ecstasy, he goes out
into the world of modern New York,
seeing everything with new eyes; he
picks up a young sailor and gets
drunk in a speakesasy, watches a riot
and goes with a pregnant woman to
the hospital, visiLs a Park Avenue
gambling den, spends the night with
his sailor boy and a prostitute, and
finally returns home to learn it was
a mistake. In his confused state oi
mind he thinks the sailor was his son
and he goes down to the harbor and
enters the water thinking to follow
the boy.

The whole of life’s sufferings, de.
lights, hopes, and disappointments arc
in fact crowded into the 24 hours Mr.
Brinig describes. Sam is universal;
his experiences are as common but
as cverlastingly wonderful as birth
itself. But he is also extremely in.
dividual. a living character. Sam Bag»
got is a little man who touches great.
ness for a moment. His saga is piti.
ful and ludicrous.

HEAVEN’S MY DESTINATION by
Thornton Wilder. Sharply unlike his
previous novels in both style and con.
tent, “Heaven’s my Destination” is a
realistic, moralistic tale lusﬁly written,
in simple American vernacular, It
concerns the adventures of a traveling
salesman, George Brush, young,
healthy, a Baptist college graduate,
and a rel' ious convert. The practice
oI his reli ous principles gets him into
a number of difficulties and ridiculous
situations, including beatings (he is a
pacifist), arrests, and marriage with a
waitress whom he had seduced some
years previously.

This work appealed to us as being
Mr. Wilder‘s best novel. It. is as bril.
liant and sharp as “The Woman of
Andros" was mawkish and pale. There
is none of the sentimentality that has
characterized his other works; the tone
is always comic or matter of fact7
with a result that NLr. Wilder’s vision
of an imperfect and suriering human.
ity comes through more markedly
than in his earlier novels.

"Heaven’s rny Destination" has been
skillfully written and, disregarding its
social significance, is good.humored
entertainment.

The youngest freshman ever enroll.
ed at Long Island university is Isidor
Kosofsky, age 13, but he doesn't like to
be called a “prodigy."
