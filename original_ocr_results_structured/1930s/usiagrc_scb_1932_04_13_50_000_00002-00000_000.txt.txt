ON THEIR MERIT

Since senior examinations evidently must be
taken, fattultl' lllolllbel‘s being of the opinion that
to abolish them would be a mistake, it seems that
Gl'illllell’s logical Step is to improve them. Senior
examinations are not now worth much to the stu-
dellt ill many courses, and this is a particularly
tragic Situation when one realizes that they could
be worth taking.

Senior examinations could sol e on the Single
Coordinating element of , lll'ses in ft lllJGl'éll arts
college. That is now one of the needs most often
Seen by graduates who disrovel- that the inter-
relation between subjects was not obvious to them
when they were ill college. A colupl'ehcnsive exam-
ination in which questions ill all con) es thllell
while in college ﬂl'e planned to show how these
courses adapt thenlselvt‘s to It major subject would
be of benefit to all students.

students need il broader bat round ill other
com es than do students lllzljo llg ill lllzllly other
Slll 'oct but the worth of such 21 plan can be made
evident in lllly’ roul‘se.

Students must, of course, be warned of such
21 pllll] when they enter coll , ill order that lllev
may point their work town that final Senior
exnllliuatioll. Consequently, it could not be put into
effect for Several years.

HOT HOUSE PLANTS?

(From the Midland)
Are college students hot house plants that need
to be sheltered and protected every day of their lives?
Or, are they young men and women who are able to
make their own decisions and manage their own lives?
It seems that college students are old enough to decide
for themselves what is right and what is wrong and
to adopt the safest and wisest course.

College students are not always given the privilege
of making their decisions, however. one college has re
cently canceled its subscription to The Chicago Tribune
because it felt that the students were under a harmful
influence in reading the newspaper. Some colleges ban
popular music and dancing as entertainments on the
grounds that the are evil influences. In dictating what
the students may read and do. college officials approach
censorship comparable to that of medieval Centuries.

Today, the young people may be protected from
influences that may make or mar their lives, but we
marrow, when they go out into the world alone. they
must face these Same influences. Why not give them a
chance now to consider these contacts, retain the good
and discard the evil, while they are under the guidance
of the college? This plan, rather than absolute pro-
tection from life at its best and worst, is more in keep-
ing with the trend of modern education.

WHY WE DON’T TURN POLITICIAN
(From the Oklahoma D l

The Indiana. Daily Student asks editorially “Should
a Student Enter Politics?" and laments that the aver»
age university strident knows practically nothing and
cares less about the trend of our national politics.

The average university student who shows the
slightest inclination towaid an interest in “activities"
is labelled in his second year as an “activity" man. He
is immediately appointed on innumerable committees,
sits on all types of governing boards, is given all kinds
of organization offices.

By the time that student has reached the age of
interest in politics, 21 to 23, he is a senior. Every minute
of his class day is taken up with classes, conferences,
meetings. He has a dinner engagement. He has fratern-
ity meeting on Monday night and organization meeting
every other night of the week. He comes home from
these meetings exhausted mentally and physically.

Then some enterprising newspaper wonders why the
average students is not consumed by an overwhelming
interest in national politics.

DOUBLE STANDARD?
(From the Kansas state Collegian)

The double standard has ceased to exist. Women
enjoy equal privileges With men, and have the some
advantages in education, business, and sports. But do
they take the knocks and the hardships with equal
sportsmanship as their brothers, and do they become
forgetful of others?

Here at Kansas State, it is noticeable to a striking
degree that the women often forget to treat the men
with the same courtesy they expect to be given them
as ladies. Men at Kansas State are gallant. They hold
floors with a right good will, and it's seldom that a
swinging rlooi- rushes in a cocd's fnec. With the men,
its another story, for the women often allow the doors
to swing wide behind them with never a thought for
the man, or perhaps another woman, who is following
them.

Naturally, any man can take care of himself. He
won’t. be injured by a door swinging in his face. But
is it the fair thing to do? Courtesy works both ways.
Men give it to women as a matter of eourse. Shouldn't.
the fair sex be courteous too? Do they take everything
and gn'vc nothing in return?

‘Stl‘ongest Lineup in Years,’
Says Cloacl‘l Stark

(speliril in The Starlcl will Blush)

OMAHA7NThe strongest lineup
Creighton university has had in five
years." Th 5 the slogan Art Stark,
head football conch at Creighton nnrl
J. v. Belford nnrl Sam Caniglia, his
assistants, have adopted as their War
cry for the 1932 campaign. nnrl afr
for but three days of spring football
practice, it appears that the three
coaches will have just that.

East, heavy linemen, many of
whom are graduates of the 1931
Creighton freshman team, and an
array of experienced backs who are
going thru their daily workouts
in preparation for the campaign give
the rosieet hue in years to prospects
here.

More Than 50

The spring squad, in spite of the
loss of many men who will partici-
pate in other sports and of others
who have just completed a strenuous
basketball season, numbers over 50
men. Heading the list is Captain
Dick "Bones” Sklenar. giant tackle
star who has been chosen on all»
Missouri Valley conference teams for
two years. Sklenar stepped on the
scales for the first night of practice
and counted 203 pounds, a gain of 16
pounds over his weight of last sea-
son. Even with such a large gain, he
is not the heaviest of the tackles.
Frank Cooney, who will be eligible
next fall after being out of school
for two years, scales 230 pounds and
Leo “Baldy" Balderman admits 213
pounds

Shifts Lineup

Several shifts have already been
announced by Coach Stark as a move
to build up a heavy and a strong
team. Howdie Gordon. regular right
halfback on the 1931 eleven, has been
shifted to quarterback. Gordon is the
most experienced man on the Creigh-
ton squsd in spite of the fact that he
was but a sophomore last fall.
