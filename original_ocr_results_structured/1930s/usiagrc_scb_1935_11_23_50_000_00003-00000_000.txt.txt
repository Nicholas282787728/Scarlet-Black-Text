Eddy Challenges
Students to Aid
School in China

A challenge to the students of
Grinnell to continue the support of

student chapel yesterday by Brew-
er Eddy, seci-etary of the Ameri-
can Board of Commissioners for
Foreign Missions. Gl'inneII-ln-
China is one of the Christian
schools in the Orient that is train-
ing the Chinese in ideals of Chris—
tian leadership, he said.

The Chinese are
even to surpassing the United
States in some lines, Mr. Eddy
pointed out. Their air lilies are
as well developed as ours, and
they are building four lane avenues
in their cities and spending thous-

Their city governments are ad-
ministered much more efficiently
than our municipalities. One of the
main reasons for China's progresi,
can be explained by the number
of Chinese men and women who
were trained in Christian colleges,
he declared,

There is a real need for these iii-
stitutions, he asserted, and it the
Ci-innell students are interested in
international peace and progress,
each one ought to contribute at
least 50 cents to the support of
Crinnell-in-Chiiia and the splendid
work it is making possible.
