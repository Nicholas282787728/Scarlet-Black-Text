Clark, Dibble
Approve Plan
to Drop Baseball

Clark and Dibble hall have voted
to drop regulation baseball from
the spring intramural sports
schedule, according to Julius Bauer
and William Voss, the presidents
of these two halls House meetings
were held this week. The other
halls are to vote on the question
soon, Mr. G. Lester Duke intra-
mural director, said yesterday.

“The intramural board is leav-
ing it entirely up to the halls
whether or not they want to play
baseball or two rounds of kittenball
or diamondball," Mr. Duke stated.

“The reason for raising the
question is that the weather and
the time elements have caused (life
ficulties in the past, and many
complaints have been received
about playing a short game and
counting it as much as a longer
one," he added.

He urges that the matter be
thoroughly considered beforc the
halls make their decision.

bilities of producing a powerful

support before we can hope to get
financial backing,"

Women Teachers Destroy
Cadets’ ‘Equilibrium'

West Poin .7(ACP)7‘I‘he "eun
librium” of United states army ca-
dets must be preserved at what-

young women who assisted at West

last year have been banned for—

When Mr. and Mrs. George Rob—

academy to teach dancing to those

they took along as aceompanists
two young women from their danc—
ing school. It was a good idea, but
it didn't work.
