The Pioneer basketball team
will start on the last and most
crucial stretch of the 1937-33
campaign tonight when the Scarlet
basket shooters will meet Creigh-
ton in a critical battle.

The game will be the first of
a four—game home stretch for the
Grinnell squad, and a good deal
will depend on its outcome.
Creighton is by all odds the
toughest team, with the exception
of Drake, which will appear here
the rest of the year.

Should the Pioneers tumble
Creighton here, the chances of
their cleaning up on Washington,
st. Louis and Washburn in the
other three of the series will pro-
bably be considerably better.

That isn’t to say that the Pio-
neers will automatically and in-
evitably beat the other three
should they conquer Creighton.
They'll have to play basketball to
do it, but certainly psychological
advantages will probably render
the chances of turning in victories
in these three tilts much better.

The new officers will have as
their first duties the selection of
