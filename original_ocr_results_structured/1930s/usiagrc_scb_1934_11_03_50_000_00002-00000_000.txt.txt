Of the occasional criticisms which reafL
ers have made of The Scarlet and Black since
the first of the School year, a disappointingly small
minority have come directly to the paper. Why
our critics should not speak directly to us, we
cannot understand. We are forced to the con-
clusion that they are either of the opinion that
we can do nothing to overcome the objections
which they are inclined to make, or that we will
not attempt to do so. In either case, we cannot
but feel that we are not being given a sufficient
opportunity to prove ourselves.

It is our wish to put out the best paper possible.
and to please our readers in everything we can——
where petty personal matters are not concerned
which conflict with our main purpose of acting
as a representative news organ of the Grinnell
students.

Consequently, we not only will gladly ac»
cept any constructive criticism the readers may
have to offer, but sincerely desire it. It is cer-
tain, if the criticisms are not made known to us
their sources are miuch less likely to be eradi-
cated.

With an inexperienced staff of reporters, com-
bined with various circumstances inherent in col-
lege journalism which make the efficiency of a
metropolitan press organization impossible, all
collegiate newspapers are faced with very de-
finite handicaps. We do not mean, however, to
let these handicaps serve as an alibi to excuse
any faults which are within our power to over—
come.

Not only will cr sins of the paper itself be
welcomed, but The Scarlet and Black is eager
to serve as the medium. through which controver—
sial points of campus interest may be discussed
The “Letters to the Editor” head lies in readiness
to introduce any constructive comment which read-
ers of the paper may wish to offer.

The Scarlet and Black is nominally the Grin~
nell college student newspaper, Why not use it
as such?

—G—

QUIET, PLEASE!

The time might be any week night, the place,
the college library, and the actors, innumerable
college students; half, earnestly trying to study,
and half there for other reasons.

As the curtain rises sounds of Squeeking
stairs, leather heels on hard floors, and the monot-
onous drone of conversing “students” reach the
ears of the imaginary audience. Three men attir—
ed in red sweaters have gathered at one table and
are discussing in a monotone interspersed with not
too subdued guffaws the latest development in
the ”touch" football league.

Two fellows are cndeavoring to explain the
sports page of the paper to an all too interested
girl in green. Far back in the comer a table
is cluttered with books while before it sits a stud—
ious co-cd vainly endeavoring to study.

Such is the picture of the college library on
almost any evening. Its avowed purpose is for study
and uninterrupted reading. Those who really wish
to study find it next to impossible simply because
they are interrupted by those who do not. If the
library is to fulfill its purpose a more rigid en—
forcement of the “quiet” signs that hang in prom-
inent places must be sought, accompanied by a
little thoughtfulness and consideration for others
by the students who go to the library for other
reasons than study.

CIVILIZATION, 1934 MODEL

Recently this interosting itcm appeared on
the editorial page of an Iowa newspaper. “China
is becoming civilized. ‘China builds Up an Air
Fleet to Make War’ says a headline.”

[ﬁt us pause briefly to smile. Here is the
enterprising editor of an up-to date newspaper, ac~
cusing China of becoming civilized on a strictly
modem basis. China, the cradle of one of the

oldest cultures that the W0] d has known, the
nation which has produced the philosopher and
prophet, Confucius, and the statesman, Sun—Yat-
Sen, “becomes civilized.” China, the nation which
had the highest type of civilization and culture
while our forefathers were roaming Europe and
Asia as crude and uncivilized nomads, is at last
catching up with the material civilization of the
western nations.

The Chinese, who invented the marine com»
pass which enabled our predecessors to discover
this continent, and whose equally important in-
vention, gunpowder, has enabled the western na-
tions to build up imperial dominions and to force
their culture upon alien peoples, have at last
awakened from their deep sleep in order to let
son'x‘e of our civilization begin to filter in.

If building an air ﬂeet, a huge navy and a
powerful army denotes progress of civilization,
just how desirable is civilization? If it means
making war on our neighbors, let us avoid it com—
pletely. Let us turn back to the barbarism cf
disarmament, the uncivilized state of peace, and
remain in blissful ignorance of war.

Other Opinions

“LAND OF SHAM"
(From Oregon Emerald)

Floyd Tillery, university graduate, writes for a re.
cent. American Spectator an account of his college career?
an account of four wasted years that will make nine.
tenths of his collegiaie readers wince because of its
striking similarity to their own dabblings in higher educa»
tion.

Tilleiy went to his university almost an illiterate,
with but one year of standardized preparationibut in
that single high school year he had made the honor roll
because, he says, "My key to Cicero was the same edition
as the teacher’s, and there was a silent, scholarly under.
standing between us not to squeal on each other." He
passed geometry because he could memorize theorems
from day to day, and his teacher couldn’t solve the
originals.

when he got to the university he found it was just
another “land of sham," and he conquered it by the
same tactics he had adopted in high School. He memoriz.
ed and bluffed his way through. He majored in English,
but never read one modem novel or current review. He
never took a book from the library to road at home. He
used “keys" to Latin and Greek. l-le crammed for exam»
inations, and thereby stamped himself as a "scholar and
thinker." in his education courses he wrote ”reams and
reams" and got a high grade merely because of the bulk
of the material. He used second—hand books that were
"spotted," and he memorized the “spots."

He entered his university, he declares, practically an
illiterate ”and came away little better off." But he obtain—
ed an A. B. and was elected to em Beta Kappa,

The point of all the foregoing is. to our mind, that
Tillery. really learned all he needed to get along. The
particular brand of bluffing and cramming that he mas-
tered so well in the halls of learning was the only
equipment he needed to make a name for himself in al.
most any of use modem professions.

A very charming senior coed informed us recently that
she had learned just two guiding principles of conduct in
college. They were: ‘

Firstvlt is wasted time to do anything yourself that
you can get someone else to do for you.

Secondrlt doesn’t matter how much you know, provid.
ed you can make people think you know a lot.

A wretched doctrine, no doubt. A doctrine that stiflcs
prcgmss, originality, erudition and self—contentment. and
substitutes a goal of mediocrity and superficiality. That
is exactly what the American university inculcates in its
average undergraduate recruiLs. is the university there-
(ore to be condemned? That is harder to say. For the
most of us, that, is just What we came to college to get:
an entree to modem social life, a standard of manners
equivalent to that of that most respected leaders in our
conununitics, and the tool for earning ourselves a living.

DOUBLE SHADOW
(The Daily Princetonlan)

Much has been said about the part to be played by

the universities in “moulding the new social order,” but
there has not been nearly enough consideration given
to the role of universities—especially privately endowed
institutions like Princeton—4n the new order after its
formation and crystallization. This question bids [air to
become one of the gravest issues which has yet faced the
educators of the country.
The tendency for society of the future seems to be
the direction of a rather drastic redistribution of
wealth, designed to preclude either dirc poverty and
extremely low living standards at the bottom of the ace.
nomic ladder or an excessive concentration of surplus
wealth at the wp of tho ladder. When one looks about
him here at Princeton and sees to how great an extent?
physically speakingtvit is the creation of men of great
wealth, the question naturally arises as to what re—
source would take the place of the millionairc's bounty
in meeting Princeton's ﬁnancial necessities in the future.
pbviously the need for money is greater than ever be
ore.

in

One alternative prcsents itself, but it is a dubious
and an unpleasant one. That is the extension of finan.
cial aid to private universities by government. At present.
through the FERA, the Federal government is extending
a hclpmg hand to the students of privately endowed col.
leges, as well as to those who have hitherto been pub—
lic. This aid is much needed and appreciated, but there
lies the possibility that it is only a prelude to further
assistance; and the danger of that course is the eansion
of political control, that bane of state universities, to in—
clude those institutions not yet under the aegis of partisan
politics. Even at that, political control of education.
bad as it is, is usually no worse than the subtle servility
to wealth and special privilege which has sometimes
pcrvndcd the atmosphere of colleges depending upon men
of wealth for their endowment. There seems to be no
way of Evading these two alternatives, both unpleasant;
but there should bc cumlul consideration of ways and
means to protect the inclepundsl‘lcc of higher education, cith.
or from having to identify itself with the established order
for self.protcction, or submitting itself to the exigencies
,of partisan dickering and control.

nerewith are presented reviews of
four more little-known magazines
which are u: be found on the second
floor of the college library. it is our
desire to acquaint the Grinncll stu.
dents with as many as possible of the
publications which are available to
them, believing many will be used
more widely if their presence )5 gen.

The Round Table is a quarterly re-
Commonwealth of Nations. The first
article in the September number on
“Navies and the Pacific" is a fine
analysis of Britain's awkward posi.
tion in the Pacific, regardless of her
superior treaty ratio to Japan, and
should interest every student of world
affairs.

. a .

Poetry, Harriet Monroe’s fine little
magazine, responsible for giving the
opportunity of seeing their work in
print to so many young poets who
have since acquired nation-wide
fame, has some poems by John Gould
Fletcher in the September isue that
will appeal to a majority of college
students.

The Nnt'loml Student Mirror is a
monthly with a distinctly liberal trend.
One of its articles, written by Albert
Holper, the author of “The Foundry"
and entitled "ice—cold Turkey" is a
review of the present student's plight
which will be catalogued as disturbing
by our more conservative friends.

Occupations is a monthly magazine
devoted to the question of vocational
guidance. it should be indispensable
to the future teacher or the student
contemplating going into personnel
work,

Official Notice

At the faculty meeting of Oct. 8 the
committee on buildings and cam-
pus plans was authorized to have
parking restriction signs painted at
the edge of the paving before the en-
Lrances to the Alumni Recitation hall,
the library, and the chapel, and the
new college club.

Mayor B. N. Whitaker has been in»
terviewed, and has expressed his will.
ingness to act in the matter. It has
seemed best to the committee, before
proceeding wiLh this undertaking,
to ask all faculty members and stu—
dents who own cars to refrain hence.
forth from parking them at the
above mentioned places. it is hoped
that in this way the trouble inn be
eliminated without the marking of
these entrance places with unsighdy
paint.

The ccmmrttee respectfully re.
quests your cooperation toward this
end.

at the University of Texas.

This year is the 300th anniversary
of the founding of the first secondary
school in the United States.

The main subject for debate in jun.

states is: “Resolved, that the federal
government shall adopt the policy of
equalizing educational opponunity
throughout the~nation by means of
annual grants to the several status for
public elementary. and secondary edu-
cation.”

Exactly $159,232,782 was allotted
from the federal emergency funds in
1933-34 for educational purposes. The
regular budget appropriations for edu.
cation during that period was $32,255,.
690.

More than 550 persons have been

Students of Northwestern un
sity have organized a Lyceum which

the series are students.

Pres. R. M. Hughes, of Iowa Strte

LET'S EAT

Don’t you sometimes long for
a specially good cup of coffee?
why don’t you drop into the
College Shop, then. Besides the
coffee, another nice thing eating
here is that you’ll always find
some of the college crowd en-
joying a cigarette or a hand of
bridge the college crowd around
to keep you company and
everybody enjoys a hand of
bridge ‘or a cigaret in the College
Shop.

The Tavern is a handy place
to have breakfast before going
to church Sunday morning. If
you want a real treat order a
cinimon roll; they're larger than
the average roll and so delic—

ious! I ,

Perhaps you may not have
time for breakfast. In that case
you might stop in at the white
spot for a snack. Quick service
and reasonable prices make this
place especially attractive to col-
lege studean. Try it sometime!

Abooth at the Dixie inn
is a keen place for a chat over
a cup of hot. tea. You might
cven be tempted to have a piece
of yununy chocolate cake too.
it seems to me that I've men—
tioned the Dixie Special before
but they’re so good that they
ought to be mentioned again.

On cold days Candyland looks
very inviting. Perhaps that’s be—
cause of the reputation it has
of serving appetitizing sand
wichcs and piping hot chocolate,
for everyone wants her choco—
lave plenty hot!
