Valley Meel'

Duke Enters Small
Squad; Applequist,
Seeger Injured

By Clark Smith

A squad of nine Pioneer track-
men will leave for St. Louis
Thursday to compete in the an-
nual Missouri Valley conference
track and field meet to he held
Friday and Saturday.

Drake and the Oklahoma Aggies
dominate the field of entries and
are expected to have a bitter
fight for the championship which
the Bulldogs won last year.

Coach G. Lester Duke has enter-
ed his smallest team in years
because he feels that the level of
competition is so high that it
warrants only entry of those men
ivho are capable of placing in
the field.

Misfortune again hit the squad
when it was announced that both
Ted Appleouist and Harold Seeger
would be unable to make the trip
because of injuries. Both men
have been consistent point
winners all season and were
counted on by Coach Duke to
perform at St, Louis,

Lynn Schlotterheck will defend
his 440 title against a fast field,
but the fleet co-captain's perform-
ance last week at Amos in runne
ing the quarter mile in :49 flat
indicates that he is again the
man to beat in that event.

The chances of the other thin-
clads remain somewhat of a mys-
tei-y, but judging on past per»
forinances, Hayward, SLlyker,
Hagan, Powers, Luther and Rob
inson should do well in their
favorite events,

Business Methods

NEW YORK CITY, (AC?)—
Sharp criticism of high-pressure
business methods employed by col-
leges and universities to recruit
tuition-paying students was made
recently by Dr. Walter A. Jessup,
president of the Carnegie Founda—
tion for the Advancement of
Teaching, in the foundation's
thirtyvseconrl annual report.

Many institutions are operating
“in constant fear" of losing stu-
dents, Dr. Jessup’s report declared.
“Not so long ago the lepresenta»
Lives of a college dropped in to
visit a high school in a small mid»
western city. His purpose was to
bring the college to the attention
of the pupils of the school. He
learned that his was the eighty
third visit of a college public-rela-
tions officer for that very purpose
during that school year.”

Even drum majors and tube
players are offered “indiicemcnts”
to come to college where their

“There can be no doubt that un-
