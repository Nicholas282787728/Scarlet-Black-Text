CORPUSCLES

William Beebe, solelltist and author, claims
tllat the leaf-cutting ants of British Guiana come
prise tllc grcatcst laboreunion or socialistic group
in the world. Building regular trails through the
jungle, they journey from their homes to favorite
trees—a distancc oftentimes of 10 or 12 miles con»
sidering the ratio of their Size to the human scale
—in ordcr to cllt off a segment of leaf, much larger
than themselves, and carry it back to the labyrinth
where it is masticated and used as fertilizer for tho
Subterranean gardens ill which the ants ra c the
fungae on wllich they live.

Night and day. these ants trudge the patll,
guiding themselves by their sense of smell and
their delicate antennae, because their eyes admit
no light. After cutting himself 3. slice of leaf. the
individual immediately sets off on the home trail.
often bumping illto the current of his trcc~bound
fellows. Sometimes, he attempts to crawl under a
stick or a clump of grass, much too low to admit
his burden. Sometimes, the wind catches his load
and tumbles him head over heels. Ill any case. if
he once loses his load, he does not attempt to pick
it up; he continues on llolnciccrtain, in his docile
ant brain, that he is doing his duty—and then turns
around to start once more for the tree, Other ants
do not notice the leaves dropped by the wayside;
they trample tl'lcm underfoot in their quest for
leaves on the tree, or as they carry their burdens
to’thc home:

Beebe compares the entire group, with its
quecn. nurses. and other units of life within the
nest, as a giant, loosely-constructed organism, of
which the leafrcuttcrs arc the corpusclcs, going and
coming for the good of the whole, without though“.
or initiative, Once, however, he noticed a commo-
tioll near the entrance to the nest. Two large lcaf—
cutters had evidently rebelled. for they wore being
set upon by their smaller fellows. The exponents
of individual rights fought gamcly. but gradually
they wcrc overpowered, their lifeless bodies were
tossed to the side of the path, and the lilies of co ‘
pust-lcs began again~tllouglltlcssly, ullfcelilr
and without illitiativeifor tllc good of the whole.

THE USE OF ENGLISH

Mideycar examination tiluc is the season of illi-
pleasant surprises. Receiving a notice from the fac—
ulty'committce on the “use of English” is ollc of
them. Unfortunately, a [cw Students who receive
this notice consider that the unpleasautncss lies not
so much ill being made aware of a deficiency, as
ill hcillg oxpcctcd to make it ilp. It is really I'Dr
lnarkablc that this attitude on 1hc part of some
students of almost refusing to accept that which
they supposedly have come to receive, has not re-

LIBERALIZATION OF THE AMERICAN
STUDENT

Skepticism and challenge arc the outstanding
characteristics of the intelligent college student of
today. (‘ruclly disappointed in men and ideals
which heretofore were honored and cherished. he
has come to doubt the wisdom of his cldcrs, and
has dared to think for himself

Ill economics and histori he learns thc truth
about exploitation and impcria sin. He discovers
that wars are not fought for noble ends, but for
the protection of private wealth and pl'OpEYi)’.

Ill philosophy there is revealed to him the
truth and origin of religion. He begins to question
(“reeds and habits which. as a child, he accepted as
absolute.

Ill biology he comes face to fact! with .5 h
nature, seeing ill the lowcr forms of life a kinship
which is more and more making him doubt his
special origin. Physics and chemistry explain to
him how and why certain natural phenomena oc-
cur.

Enlightened by the revelations of the hat.“ ll
and social sciences, coupled with the fearless ex-
position of facts by his professors. the American
student, for the most p has becomc skeptical of
the value and incvitalli ty of war, of divillcly or-
dained social and theological dogmas, and chal-
lcllgcs the intelligent-c of his follow students ill or-
dcr to strive toward a Society wherein the right to
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness shall he

HOMECOMING

Come home, alumni, all is forgiven.

This. \iitll reasonable r ‘Il“lillts, is the spirit
of homecoming. It is the pint of those things
which make up the college life which is outside tllc
pole of classes and books. ’l‘llc homecoming program
itself reflects this spirit. The gridiron banquet,
the play, the football game. tllc dance as well as
receptions, addresses, and the gatllcll gs of all
nature, provide for a wcckclld of tl-nns1tloll illto a
colorful world which is all too temporary.

Other Opinions

RABELAIS AND HIS IMITATORS. . .
(Daily O’Collegiun)

Fnllowing the lead of Ballyhoo, so-called humor
magazines have been ﬂooding the country of late with
just about the lowest form of wit imaginable. They
make a. stab at Gargantusn humor without any visible
evidences of Rabelais's redeeming traits. Rsbelais reek-
ed of the stables, but a dirty stable smells_like a rose
in comparison with some other odors we could mention.

Oklahoma City's own Bandwagon. not to be outdone
by the sheets having national eirculstion nor by the
popular Broadway columnist, goes them one better. Its
November issue includes a few moth eaten stories which
were drifting from gutter to gutter when Oklahoma
City was in its infancy, and a full page photograph of
three nude figures said to have been taken from the
top of one of the capital buildings. And we thought the
fellows who sold French postcards and other wares at
the gates to the World's Fair had a low profession!

at is conceivable that an off-color yarn may be
funny if it has anything else to commend it besides its
filth—but ﬁlth alone oventually becomes nauseating.

If the Bandwagon and magazines of its ilk are
indicative of the reading testes of the American public,
something is radically wrong with our civilization.

Luckily, however, they aren’t. Nor are the smutty
moving pictures the ones which gain lasting popularity.
‘Abie's Irish Rose," we read, enjoyed quite s run over
the country—and now and then a moving picture and»
hence seems to enjoy a picture which hasn’t a. bed room
as its central setting.

Virginia Ralston, '34, spoke in stu—
dent chapel un sleep and the neces-
sity for it among college students.
She showed the audience contrasting
illustrations of the student who had
had full eight hours sleep and the
one who had used the night for oth-
or purposes than for the “sleep that
knits up the ravelled sleeve of care."

Tuesday

"The other day I told my neighbor
I wanted to sell him my radio and
my piano for a dollar," hegsn John
M. Bridgeham, professor of Latin.

Selling his piano and radio for a
dollar and buying them back for
$1.25 at the end of the month was
the clever plan to get around the
tax assessor as Professor Bridgebsm
dreamed it after reading the account
of the Charles E Mitchell trial, he
told the gathering. “Mitchell prac-
ticed a like ruse when he sold a large
amount of bank stack to his wife to
avoid paying income tax on it.

“With our highest financial offi-
cials so corrupted. we have gradually
lost sight of the ideals for which our
revolutionary ancestors fought,” de-
clared the speaker. ”The NRA holds
some promises for getting us out of
our difficulties "

Wednesday

A Concerto in D’Minor by Bach for
violin, oboe, and piano was played by
Sarah Innes MacDonald. assistant

liams, instructor in wind instruments.
The selection was presented in three
movements. Allegro, Adagio, and Air
legro.
