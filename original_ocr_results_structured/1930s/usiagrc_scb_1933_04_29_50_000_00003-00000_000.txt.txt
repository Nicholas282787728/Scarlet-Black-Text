THE GRINNELL SCARLET

AND BLACK

 

Maurie Sherman, to Play Here Soon,
Preferred Violin, Baseball to School

Former Cub Bat Boy Got
Fi‘l‘st Orchestra Job
at Age of 16

When Maurie Sherman. who brings
his orchestra to Grinnell for the an-
nual Brown Derby Drag, next Sat»
urday, through arrangements made
with Music corporation of America.
was 15 years old, he was living in

Chicago with his parents, going to-

school, studying violin very seriously.
and taking a good deal of time to
act as bat boy for the Cubs.

School meant nothing to young-
Sherman; he went only because his
father wanted him to go, and when
he found it interfered with base-
ball, he cast school aside. He
found himself in a serious corne
however, when he was summoned to
the principals office and asked the
reasons for his absence, which, Oil
course. he said was due to lllness,|
and was then requested to procure a
doctor's certificate.

Father Favored Education

Father was in favor of an educa-
tion. believing it more important
than a musical career; mother was
a little in favor of the violin; and
Maurie, being his mother's favorite.
knew where to turn, therefore, was
spared complete annihilation at the
hands of his dad.

His first job of playing the violin
in a dance orchestra whose other in-
struments consisted of a battered pi»
ano and a dilapidated set of drums,
he obtained at the age of 16. A real
musician—earning two dollars a
night and a full fledged member of
the musicians' union! He played in
bands of all sorts for some years be-
fore he made his first important con-
nection. during that time enjoying
many interesting and some rather
comical experiences.

Got First Job With Kata

When Sam Katz, now of the fam—
ous Baiaban and Kate, was opening
his first movie house, he needed an
orchestra of some sort, and Maurie,
then 17, applied for the job, fiddle in
hand. After listening to him, Mr.
Katz decided in his favor, to the tune
of 10 dollars a week. success, as of-
ten happens, went to his head after
a few months, and the lad demanded

up some warm words, after which
the “Ind and his fiddle” made a
speedy exit. Then he played for a
whole summer in a concert orchestra
on one of the Lake Michigan excur-
sion boats; and for five years in a
dance orchestra at Columbia hall.

waddy Wadsworth was at that
time making up an all-star hand to
feature at the winter Garden, Chi-
cago, and offered Maurie a place. It
,was the very opportunity he was
looking for; and it meant much more
money than he had ever earned be-
fore. Arnold Johnson sought his sel‘»
vices at the Green Mill, and when
Johnson left, Maurie took over the
orchestra.

Isham Jones Gives Advice

Later Isham Jones, at that time
in command of quite a few orches
tras beside his own, saw Maurie
‘there, and approached him with the
'dea that started him in the pro-
fession in which he is now one of the
finest, Mr. Jones appointed him lead»
er of his Colonial orchestra, at the
Bismarck hotel, Chicago, after a
year of which Maurie struck out for
himself. A few years ago, Maurie
Sherman ran second in a popularity
contest conducted by one of the ra-
dio fan magazines.

The Sherman orchestra has been
featured, for four years, at the tea
dansant in the College Inn, Hotel
Sherman, and the Sal Taharin, Chi-
cago, broadcasting over WENR,
WMAQ, WBBM, and the NBC net-
work.
