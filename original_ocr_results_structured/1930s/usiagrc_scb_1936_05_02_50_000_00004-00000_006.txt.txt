COLLEGE students invariably sneer at Hollywood‘s

celluloid conceptions of their life, conceptions in
which ukeleles and 52. phones play more important roles
than textbooks, fraternity houses resemble royal suites
at the Ritz, and professors (men while leading the class
in the latest dance rage.

lean remember when l shared in the general indigna-
tion. “Why can't those guys ever produce a real, honest-
targosh, downrtoearth picture of undergraduate life?"
I used to ask myself. Havrng recently been one of “those
guys", I can cite several reasons why college prctures
are as they are and perhaps always will remain much as
they are.

The average theater'goer associates youth, music. love.
beauty, gaiety, and laughter (never books) wrth college
life, and consequently expects to see these elements in a
college picture. The ﬁlm producer, whose natural showr
manly preference lies more in the direction of snappy
dialogue and dance routines than classroom dignity,
knows this and is prepared to meet the demand His
pictures are intended {or the ﬁlni/gomg public as a whole,
and not solely for a few hypercritical students. For this
reason most college ﬁlms, outside of the annual football
epic (for which I offer no apologies), are musicals.

Producers feel, and perhaps rightfully, that they are
giving the great mass of [harertgoers what they expect,
A painstakingly produced picture hased on college life as
it actually is might be a dtsmrll failure. We college'people
might not even appreciate it. After all, twentieth cen-
tury pioneering. especrally in the cinema, comes it bit

expensive, and the producer. it he wants to stay in hos-r
