After- getting those exam papersl
back without it mark on them, we ore
tempted to try ohe old trick of writ-
ing somewhere in the middle, "If you
read this far you *ll'xé-‘cm you can
flunk me." Which, they probably
would.

NEW YORK (CNS) 7 Columbia
university-s 1933 variety show will
parody the antics of Tammany hall
and former Mayor James J. Walker
of New York,

The scene will be a mythical Balkan
country where an ex—mayor of New
York City goes into retirement, only
to turn the local government into a
satirical political machine, strongly
reminiscent of Tammany.

The show is tentatively titled
"Have a Cigarn and will be presented
in March.

Illusion.
This my old illusion was invented by Indian
fakirs. The secret was unearthed i 1849 by the
great magician, lioben-lloudi. Al run one, clllcr
had just been discovered, and liulc “as known
about it. Houdin claimed ll’ml i. had discovered
that ibis new anesthetic could mate people bgln as
all. To prove it, he caused the subject to rise into
the air and ﬂoat apparently suspended. [is passed
a hoop around the body to show there \vtl'e no
wires or supports.

...it’s more fun to KNOW

Another ”magic show” is cigarette adver-
tising.

One of its grcolcst ll'icks is the illusion
that cigarettes can be made miraculously

because raw, inferior tobaccos require

more intensive treatment than choice, ripe
tobaccos.

The real difference comes in the tobaccos
that are used. The better the tobacco, the

milder it is.
