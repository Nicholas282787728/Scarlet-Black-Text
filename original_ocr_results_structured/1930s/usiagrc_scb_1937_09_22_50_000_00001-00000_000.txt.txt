Miss Burtis Finds Europeans
Unworried by Threats of War

In China, on Other Side.
of World, Student’s
Home Bombed

“Europeans as a whole are much
less worried about the threat of
war than are Americans,” says
Miss Caroline Burtis, assistant in
political science and hostess in
Cleveland cottage, who has just
returned from a summer abroad.

“It is true that one is aware
of many uniformed men in both
Germany and Belgium, but at the
same time the people seem happy
and one is impressed by the Won—
derful marching songs of the sol-
diers."
Masses Uninfornled

“The masses, particularly in
Germany, are uninformed about
the situation in Spain for example,
and they are convinced that Hnler
desires peace above everything
else," Miss Eurtis said.

In England she found the peo-
ple “feel that the government's ef-
tort to maintain peace has been
rather £utile,‘ but at the same
time they feel that they have a
definite responsibility to keep
peace in Europe.
