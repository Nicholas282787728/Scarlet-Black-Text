STUDENTS AND POLITICS

Ordinarily a snow storm on the night of a
political debate means the debaters will talk
to empty seats; but Monday night busloads
of people drove 150 miles ill a blizzard to
hear Dr. Francis Townsend debate Profes-
sor Irving Stone. Most of the people were
not rich; some complained of the 50 cent
fee charged at the door; most of them were
women; there were a few l‘aborersl But all
of them had one thing ill commollithey
wanted something from the government.
They listened to their prophet, further—
more, with the complacent satisfaction of
people who know they will eventually get
what they want.

The Townsendites are a minority, but
they are organized and they are being
heard. In faroff aristocratic Massachusetts,
aristocratic Senator Henry Cabot Lodge has
just smiled winningly at them. There is
justification for the belief that in the fu-
ture the money spent today on education
will be spent on old-age pensions.

The Townsendites are a minority; but
ally efficient minority can victimize a
democracy, as did the Prohibitionists, as
does any big business. Only an organization
of disinterested voters can combat them
successfully.

There is not much that the college student
wants from the government; to him it is
an abstraction productive of sleep if dis-
cussed in classes, productive of polite bores
dom if discussed elsewhere, Since it offers
him little, he takes little interest in it; us-
ually he is too unimaginative to see that
government is as important and as perva-
sive as the weatherionly, he can change
the government if he wants to. The
weather he must accept.

He cannot bring about the change alone,
but he can make a start by knowing who
his representatives are in Congress and the
legislature, what they stand for, and
whether he can trust them. He will be on
his way to becoming the most terrifying
person ill the country, terrifying, that is, to
the politicians—an intelligent disinterested
(not uninterested) voter.

THE ECONOMIC PLEBISCITE

Monday, Nov. 14, each Grinnell college
student will be asked to register his opine
ions on seven economic questions concerning
our government and our labor problems.
The questions will be in the form of a bal-
Iot; no signature is necessary The ballots
will be brought to the students, and when
marked, will be collected. By this method,
a minimum of effort will be required of

each person.

These ballots are prepared and printed
by the Council of Social Action, and it is
likely that between one-half and three-
quarters of a million people all over the
United States will participate in the voting,
Oll ollr campus, the Sunday Evening club
is sponsoring the collection, tabulation, and
analysis of thc balloting. The results will
be published for everyone to see.

A scholarly knowledge of economics is not
essential for marking the ballots. The pur—
pose of the Council for Social Action in con~
ducting this plebiscite is to discover as near-
Iy as possible the opinions of people on the
issues which are presented.

Most of the voting is being conducted ill
churches. Grillncll is one of the few educa»
tional institutions which will be polled. As
a result, the big question is whether you
think a Christian duty is involved in each
issue, and if you do think so, whether the
Christian should favor or oppose the propo-
sitions. The ballot states the problem this
way:

Indicate what you consider your
Chi' tum obligation to bo l'u connectiou
with the following programs: (Check
only mm square llflcr each question).

The squares after each question are headed
To favor, To oppose, and No Christian
issue involved. Here are the seven programs,
or question

1r Provision by yOve’r'lHnmlt of jobs
for those unable to find work in private
employ.

24 Use of federal measures to support
agricultural programs.

8. Organization of labor l’uto nation-
al unions. ’

.4. The maintenance or increase of
tariffs and other trade Tum 7‘s.

5. The further extension of public
ownership of electric utilities.

6. Organization of consmncr cooper-
olives

7. The further social couti‘ol of 010'
ccouomic system.

At the bottom of the ballot is provided
space to check your sex, age, and occupa—
tional groups. This data is necessary for
intelligent interpretation of the results.

All of the questions involved are of ill-
terest to us, and we are fortunate that
Grinnell was chosen to take part ill the
actual voting.

The Sunday Evening club, which is spon-
soring the balloting, is a non-denomina-
tional group formerly known as the Fellow-
shipl It conducts a variety of discussions
pertinent to living in,'alld after, college.

Sunday at 7:15 pm. the club will have
student presentations of some of the topics
to be voted upon ill the plebiscite. As us-
ual, everyone is welcome to attend.

__G_
YOUR OPINION, PLEASE!

All students of Grinnell have opinions;
opinions on everything that can be talked
about; opinions on all topics in general and
many topics in particulurl Many of these
opinions would look well ill writing and the
question is, are the students afraid to»cx-
press them?

Tile Scarlet and Black would like to start
a column for student opinion, on open
forum. This is your paper and we would
like to have your participation. We wel-
come Constructive criticism, suggestions and
comments about anything of current inter-
est, although preferably of course about
campus affairs.

The only requirements we make for the
publications of such a letter are that it be
short, ot more than 150 words, and that
the W1 or must at least sign his or her
llllblalsl Such a procedure is simple, and
would not necessarily divulge his or her
identity.

We would also appreciate criticism_ 1'
the editorials that appear here Such an -
cisms are heard on all sides, so why not

‘ and have published some of these

“Great leaders ar generally snobs with
a sense of responsibility.” So University of
Manitoba’s Pres. Sidney Smith is out to get
more students that “are conscous of be-
longing to a class."

 

FROM THE EDITOR
TO THE READERS

At long last the preps of Clark
hall were faced with o problemﬁ
a problem they were compelled to
fulﬁll, yet a problem they must
have loved. I feel sorry for preps.
They always have to do the up~
perolassmen's dirty work.

"It must go," said two mem-
bers of the Clark house council.
"It's either removing your mus-

nuslness Imsn't been so
good s' be Cllllk hnll
Ilus int 15 mus in-
to ball) you ought
to see the ob they did
an newley.

tache, Rowley, or it's the paddle
for us," said the preps.

So a prize possession of this
writer was ”smoothed on" after
months of patient grooming. One
side was a little darker than the
other, but, nevertheless, there was
something there!

Two members of the Clark
hall house council thought there
was too muoh there!

They say if you can't make a
decision for yourself, others will
make it for you. The preps made
my decision for me, but I feel
like a man walking around bare-
footed out doors in the dead of
winter!

At long last it happened: Aftv
er two months of waiting and
after two months of swallowing
words of disapproval, removal of
the “prize possession" was inevit»
able.

But the work was done in style.
The victim, confronted by a bat-
talion of freshmen (acting as pro~
teetors of the instigators of the
plot, which was a good idea and

a wise move on their part), head»
ed by two house councilman,
could do nothing but recline in the
easy chair of his “quarters" and

,ch the work be done. What a dif-

ference as compared to first chair
Sanitary:

Right now rm like an animal
when it sees itself 1!] the mirror.
I look behind the mirror to see
who the stranger is!

The saying nevertheless still
goes that “whatever is lost can
be gained again.”

But thank God they used an
electric razor:
