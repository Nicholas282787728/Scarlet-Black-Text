literary magazine, from May 1 to
Dec. 1, 1932, is rated as distinctive
by Edward J. O'Brien, in his annual
volume, Best Short Stories of 1933
and Yearbook of the American Short
Story.

The mark of highest distinction,
which indicates that the story is
worthy of being reprinted in book
form, is awarded to ”Woman En-
cased in Ice,” by Vladimir Moiseye»
vitch Cherkasski, published in the
March Tanager. “Big Money in the
Harvest ﬁelds" by Harold Croghan,
“Interlude" by Roderick Lull, and
“Rain" by Margaret Lewis each
have two asterisks.

“Grass" by Mildred Plew Merryr
man, "We Ride at Night" by Robert
Kalver, and two stories, “Devilsv’ln
the Bone" and “Saturday Night" by
Jay G. Sigmund, whose verse as well
as prose has frequently appeared in

Second Drama
Project Cast

Complete Personnel of Play

Announced by Director

The complete cast for the second
major drama production of the year,
"Children of the Moon," by Martin
Flavin, was announced today by the
director of the play, Louise Smith,
'34. Rehearsals for the play, which
is to he presented early in December,
began last week.

Ruth Pilgrim will play the 'role of
Jane Atheiton, the daughter of Laura
Atherton, to be portrayed by Marion

ment, to thc type of story repre-
scntcd by the best work of Sherwood
Andcrson and Ernest Hemingway,
whose aim is to stimulate the reach
er's imagination and reflective pow-
ers. g

Mr, O'Brien tests a story for sub»
stance and for form. If the author
makes vitally compelling his selected
facts or incidents, if he shapes this
substance into a beautiful and sense
fying form by skillful arrangement
and appealing presentation so that
the reader responds to the persua—
sive sense of life in the story, he
may be said to have survived the test
of substance and the test of form.

Little Magazine Important

Fiction in The Tanager was ranked
by the same standards as that in
such magazines as Harpers, The Sat-
urday Evening Post, and The Atlan-
tic Monthly.

Speaking of the value of maga—
zines like The Midland, The Frontier,
and story in discovering and develop
ing new Writers, Mr. O'Brien makes
the declaration that the most im~
portant short-story magazine in the
World today is the “little magazine."

Vacation Wins

in Student Poll

Vote Favors Thanksgiving
Extension 43 to 1

In a poll of the quadrangle and
dormitories, tabulated last night by
Dwight Campbell, president of the
Student Council, 393 students, out of
402 who voted, expressed their desire
for incorporating the Friday after
Thanksgiving in the vacation period.

This poll places the sentiment of
the student body at 43 to 1 in favor
of the extended vacation.

In 1931. after agitation by the
students, the period was extended to
include the extra day.

A petition of the students was
turned down by the curriculum com»
mittee last year because of the grant-
ing of a victory day following the
Drake game which ended 6 to 0 m
favor of the Pioneers.

The question will be submitted to
the Lantern club at its meeting Wod-
nesday evening, and if the vote is far
vorable, the petition and a letter-will
be submitted to the curriculum com-
mittee, asking for the Thanksgiving

Pioneers Fight
to Hold Strong
Blue jay Eleven

Visitors Score on Reverse
Play in Second Period
to Win, 6 to 0

A tricky, well-executed, triple-
revcrse play gave Creighton unlver~
city a touchdown margin, to adminis-
ter the sixth Consecutive defeat of
the season to Coach Lester Watt‘s
Grinnell college eleven, 6 to o, in a
Missouri valley conference game
played on Ward field here, last night.

Despite an unusually good showing
on the part of the Pioneers on de~
fensc, the Bluejays managed to ad-
Vance to the 15-yard line in the sec.
ond quarter as a result of a pass.
The reverse play featured Egbert,
Gordon, and Schmidt, with the latter
skirting the right end-in a flashy run
for the only score of the game. Pete
McKee made a beautiful block of the
attempted place-kick for the extra
point.

Creighton Passes Successful

While the Pioneers, who are con-
sidered an aerial-minded aggregation,
did not attempt any passes until late
in the third quarter, the Creighton
eleven unleashed a pass threat early
in the game and was successful in
making good four heaves for a total
of 60 yards. Grinnell men intercepted
two 02 the enemies’ attempts.

Creighton also took the advantage
on first downs, scoring nine, to four
for Grinnell. Gordon, senior ball tot-
er for the Bluejays, was the main
cog in the offensive attack, reeling
off consistent gains over five yards,
and also doing a good job of spot-
puntiug. Schmidt, sophomore back,
helped his team-mate with several
long, offrtdckle runs.
