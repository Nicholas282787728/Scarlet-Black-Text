Chase, Pillsbury on Program

Author First;
Third Speaker

Undetermined

Botanist to Show Pictures

of Plants, Animals
With Lecture

Two men have chosen to appear
on the Grinnell college lecture
course. They are Stuart Chase and
Arthur C. Pillsbury. The lecture
course committee will meet soon to
decide upon a third speaker.

Stuart Chase is an economist and
the author of “Men and Machines"
and "The Tragedy of Waste”. He is
a graduate of Harvard, attended the
Massachusetts Institute of Teehnol<
ogy, is a certified public accountant
and is director of the Labor Bureau
Inc.

Submits Analysis

In his lectures, covering years of
research, Mr. Chase neither attacks
nor defends, but submits analysis of
cause and effect with suggestions as
to the future.

Mr. Pillsbury, a naturalist, lec-
tures with a photographic mechane
ism supplemented by x-ray motion
pictures. He shows the life struggle
of plants and flowers in a few mine
utes on the-screen. Through micro-
scopic attachments he shows organ-
isms too small to he seen by the eye.

Revealed First Time -

of this photographerebotanist, the
Popular Science Monthly says, ‘The
secret of what takes place in the
heart of a rose, as it unfolds from
the bud, is revealed for the first time
in an amazing moving picture film
made by Mr. Pillsbury."

Most of the films are colored.
The program includes movies of
flowers, trees, insects, seed germin-
ation, pollen and leaf circulation.

Staff. to Include One Man
From Each Hiall

will serve as editor of the paper, has
been consulting with the council of

taining probably four pages, with
three columns to a page, and will he

month.

thing in Crinnell college. Each house
editor will submit news from his hall

in the dormitories, but not to out-
siders. The aim of the new paper will
be to unite the men’s halls more

The Scarlet and Black nor will the
two papers compete as news med-
iums.

is tho third of a Scl'lcd of
historitr of campus organizations be
my published from time to time by
The Scarlet and Block.

Crinncll college's Women’s Glee
club is now beginning its ‘twentye
fifth year. It was organized in
1907 by George L. Pierce, profes~
sor of music, to stabilize the Inem»
bcrship of the vcsper choir as well
as form a separate organization for
women’s voices. Up to that time
the choir was composed of students
faculty and townspeople, with no
system for regular attendance.

Extensive tours have been taken
by the club, including one in 1912
that reached as far west as Los An-

7 by George Pierce

geles. The club had a membership
of 24 until two years ago when
an alternate was added for each
part. New members are selected
each fall by competitive tryouts.

Many famous choral works for wo-
men’s voices have been presented,
among which are “Night" (Saint-
Sacns). “Blessed Damsel" (Debus—
sy), “Seven Greek Pastoral Scenes"
(Parker), "Spring Cycle" (Grieg),
Prof. Elias Blum’s three compo-
sition for women’s voices, “The Last
Tea of Tsuki”, "Silver Bells and
Cockleshells" and “Romany Redo"
and many songs by Rachmininow.

Professor Pierce has been the di-
rector every year since it started,
excepting the two years that he
spent abroad. In 1910-11 Prof.
David E. Peck was director, while
in 1930—31 the duties were assumed
by Prof. Hugo Goodwin.

Erma Suckow, of Ruth

dent of the club in 1907.

Recalling Hap Moran's sprint of
the entire length of the field on the
opening kickoff in 1924 to give Crin-
nell a s to 0 victory when the teams
last met, the 1931 Coe college eleven
will be a determined aggregation
when it knocks the lid off the foot-
ball season here at 8 pm Friday.

With a single day of practice re-
maining before the contest, Coach L.
L. (Fuzz) Watt has rounded his men
into fair shape despite the handicap
of inexperience and injuries. Hard
driving has been on the gridiron
menu since the first practice Sept.
10.

Develop Spinners

The mentor sent his men through
long drills Monday and Tuesday in
an effort to develop co-ordination in
Grinnell spinner plays, Despite the
rain and mud Monday. the Pioneers
were sent against the freshman
squad, but on the heavy field the
superior weight of the freshman
proved a handicap. The yearlings
took the offensive against the varsity
Tuesday but could gain nothing.

The Pioneers gave evidence of a
scrappy defence, making up for lack
of weight with fighting spi The
work of Christoffersen and Craflund
on defense was outstanding. When
the Pioneers took the offense, Glotz
showed up well.

Golz at End

Colz will probably get the call for
the left end position,'although Dun-
can will see service. At left tackle,
Canavan is favored, while Lake has
shown improvement since his return
to the lineup after a short illness.
with Figland still mursiog a bad
knee, either Martin or Rosenhloono
will start at left guard. Captain
Christoffersen will be at center, al-
though handicapped by an injured
hand.

Craflund has become a ﬁxture at
right guard, and Bilto has had no
serious competition for right tackle.
The right wing berth is still in
doubt. Coach Watt will probably
make his choice between Edman and
McKee.

Rose May Start

I-iank Thomas will have his old
post at quarterback. Al Ruse,
brother of Harold Rose, who cap-
tained the 1929 team, will probably
get the call at fullback, because of
his defensive ability. McCreary,
Ullrich, and James, will see service
at the halfback positions.

Coach Moray Eby announced
Tuesday that Ken Madden, veteran
tackle, Will captain the Kohawks in
their ﬁrst game of the season Fri-
day. Eloy has been faced with the
problem of rebuilding a new team,
and only four men are certain of
their positions. They are Madden
tackle, Mansager, end, Rasmussen,
who has been transferred from end
to center this year, and Byrnes,
three-year veteran and quarterback.

Allstate Gum-d

Schwank, a former allestate high
school men while playing with Dav~
enport, is likely to start at one
guard, and Abrams will probably get
