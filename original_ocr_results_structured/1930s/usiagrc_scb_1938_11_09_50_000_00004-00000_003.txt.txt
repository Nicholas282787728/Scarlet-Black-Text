RE these busy, trying days for you?
Do you find yourselr, at day's
end, irritable, nerve-weary? Take a
moment—study the dog above. He’s
resting his nerves. Even in the midst
ofsttenuous action he will stop, relax.
The dog does that instinctively, though
his nerves are complex, high-keyed
like our own.
We, trained for the intense contest
or modern life, are likely to ignore

the distress signals of our nerves—
the instinctive urge to rests So often,
we let out will-power drive us on at
a task, hour after hour, headless of
nerve tension.

You don't want your nervous system
to be a drag, See what u dirretence it
makes when you rest your nerves regu-
lady—When you LET UP7LIGHT UP
A CAMEL. Enjoy the matchless mild»
ness of Camel's rich, ripe tobaccos.
