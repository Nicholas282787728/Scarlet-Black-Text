A FAIR. TRIAL

l 't week students and faculty members of .

Grinllell college will attempt an experiment. For
three days, instead of regular classes, reading and
review may be carried on in residence rooms. tllc
library, _or in class rooms. Immediately preceding
comprehensive examinations, the period will give
the student an ‘opportunity to review his entire

semester’s work without cramming and without.

loss of sleep.

Yet. as is true with all experiments. there is
a chance for defeat of purpose. If students makc
of the event a flv -day weekend on which to go
home or on which to forget classes entirely. the
experiment will have failed and will not again be
attempted.

It is easier for most students to concentrate on
one subject for a lollg period of time than to re-
snme their trend of thought time and again after
countless interruptions. For this reason, it has been
asked that quiet be observed. that social telephon-
ing be confined to certain hours and that social
hours take place between 4:30 pm. and 7:30 pm.

There may be flaws in the plan which will not
be evident until examinations have ended. But at
least it deserves a fair trial.

PE‘ITY THIEVERY

Even in the higher ins tutious of learning
there are individuals who will stoop so low as to
engage in petty thievery. It is no indication of
brilliance to get away with such misdemeanors for
every man is auccptcd for what he represents him-
self to be in this dclnocratic institution.

We pride ourselves on the democracy of Grille
hell and expcnd every cffort possible to maintain
this democracy. But there always arrives a tilnc
when We question the desirability of this dclnoc-
racy. We ask. “Arc we. not lctting ourselves ill for
some pretty harsh floccings‘l”

Recently the theft of a watch. valuable to its
owncr. was reported to this office. It was one of
the many thefts that have occllrrcd ill the basclncnt
of the nlcn’s gymnasium. Of course. the dressing
quarters of the men's gym are far from modern
and there is little security against theft but if
every student in school accepted this supposedly
prevailing spirit oE democracy for its full worth
and made sincere attempts to abide by it, there
would be little cause fol-Cthe locksmith.

”When wc were freshmen.” it was a heinous

tradition was religiously lived up to.

What a change there would be if all the Grill-

Remember when students,

Remember when freshmen showed proper re-

sophomorc year before getting the “cocky attie

Remember the Pioneer Pruditics?

Of course we can remember. But how sad it is
that most of Grinliell’s favorite traditions a few
years ago have since been ruled out of existence or
have been forgotten.

Every year at this time the men's halls begin
to contemplate expenditures for tllc coming months
and question the income from house dues. Alrcudy
some halls have become quite involvcd financially

Those fierce and frantic efforts are offending

BEAUTIFUL WORDS RAZZED
(N. Y. Herald-Tribune)

The ten most beautiful words in the English lan-
guage, as listed recently by Wilfred J. Funk, poet and
president of Funk & Wagnalls. publishers. were coldly
received by members of the literati and the philological
aristocracy. The decade. which consists of dawn. hush.
lullaby. murmuring. tranquil. mist. luminous, chimes,
golden and melody. was universally criticized. and not
more than one word pleased any one person.

Ring Lardner. amateur enthnologist and professor
of colloquial derivations. was the first expert visited in
a search for comment on Mr. F‘unk's list. Mr. Lardner
was discovered at No. Visitors. N Y.. reading Burton
Roscoe's "Titans of Literature."

As he finished reading each page he tore it out.
crumpled it and threw it on the floor. His caller asked
him why he was doing it.

“Because 1 am a vandal. Sir." he answered. "When
I reach page 396. on which there is reported to be a.
typographical error. 1 shall close the book and list the
ten most beautiful words in the English language."

When he had read page 396 he closed the hook and
began to dictate.

“Gangrene is the first word, flit is the second, scram
is the thirdibut wait until I finishimange is the
fourth, wretch is Llle fifth and smoot, with a small s. is
the sixth. Look it up.

"Guzzlc is number seven, MeNaboe is eight. 1 know
it's a proper name. And blute is number nine. A blute.
sir, is a smoker who doesn't inhale. The tenth word is
crene. A crene is a man who inhales but doesn't smoke."
He ceased talking and rapped three tuna on the wall.

“Every afternoon at this time the ghost of Lieu-
tenant Becker comes to visit me." he explained. ”come
and see me again some time.”

Dorothy Parker was the next person visited. She
was having tea in her apartment in the Hotel Lowell. 23
East Sixtyrthil'd street.

"With my small white teeth." she said. “1 tear sweet
white bread. A young man wrote that in a poem once.

Why, what a silly list. Hush isn’t pretty. I don't think . .

so much of these others either. To me the most beautiful
word in the English language is cellar-door. Isn't it won-
derful? The ones I like though. are 'chequlc' and ‘in-
closed: Have some tea '2"

Fannie Hurst. novelist. was returning to her apart—
ment at 27 West Sixty—seventh street when accosted.

"Dawn," she said, "is like a dead cat. Lullaby is
nice. Luminous is good, but not as good as lyric. I
think there are more beautiful words than these: so-
renity. peace. beauty itself. vihality, mercy. madonna.
Just say madonna to yourself. It’s like a cradle. isn’t it?
No. 1 don’t. think much of the list."

Hendrik Willem van Loon. historian, read the list
in his apartment in the Hotel Holly. 36 Washington
Square. “Why." be said. “the most beautiful words in
the language can’t be printed. Listen:

"The most beautiful one that is printable is cellar—
door. What? Dorothy Parker said so too? Well, rve
only met Miss Parker twice in my life, and we never
talked of cellarrdool‘s. I don't feel the English language,
though. because the first 20 years of my life were pass-
ed with the Dutch language. I don’t like soft words. i
llke the hard sounds, the short words. like talk. Cuspi-
dor is a good word, too. Has any one ever used cellar-
door?"

He was told that it had been used in a popular song
of the '90s, beginning:

"I don’t want to play in your yard.
I don't like you any more;

You'll be sorry when you see me
sliding down our cellar door.”

“Beautiful,” he said. "Now for the cuspidor song."

FOOTBALL AND THE PUBLIC
(Dally Illini)

Those athletic directors and fans who bemoan the
passing of the big gates in football might look around
on their own doorstep for the answer to the question.
They say that we used to have capacity crowds at all
games. and now the receipts have fallen off so that there
is no chance of paying more than expenses. while there
was a time when football supported all of the other
sports.

We will cite the recent eastern games that brought
out capacity crowds. The Notre DamerArmy game that
had a gate of 30,000. and the Southern Californi2t~Notm
Dame game that checked up a score of over 100.000 cus»
tomers. All right. we will admit that the teams were
exceptional. but then consider the case of Temple uni-
versity that has so much faith in football that is hiring
Pop Warner and laughing at the creditors who just re-
ceived their last checks on the brand new stadium. The
Armeravy game brought out a capacity crowd in spite
of the inferiority of the one team.

Every team in the country can't have the best
record of the year every year. but a little showmanshlp
can be introduced and a few publicity ideas might be
loosed to get in the gates. Look over the provessional
football records this year and the gate receipts for the
forthcoming game between the Chicago Bears and the
Portsmouth Spartans, With no student bodies to furnish
easy pickings for the box office. the professional teams
are managing to put on a good show and the grand-
stands are being filled with more and more every game.

instead of putting out financial statements that speak
for themselves and then proceeding to make a public
statement as to the causes for it. there might be a little
extra thought given the subject in advance. Publicity
directors are handicapped by having to contend with a
public the same as any other professional publicity di»
rector has to do, keep pace with competitors who have
better teams, meet the public sentiment that feels we
should not put any emphasis on football. and try to aid
in getting a marketable team. that will draw the box
office.
