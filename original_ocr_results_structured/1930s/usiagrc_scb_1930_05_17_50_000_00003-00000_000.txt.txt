California Meet
at Stanford Today

STANFORD UNIVERSITY,
CALIF. ._ Track teams of South-
ern California, California, U. C.
L. A., and Stanford will make theirl
ﬁnal appearance of the year on the
Paciﬁc Coast in the annual California
Intercollegiate here Saturday.

Southern California and Stanford
are expected to ﬁght it out for high
point honors with odds favoring the
Trojans. However, the Bears and
Bruins have enough individual stars
to add color to the events where the
two leaders are weak.

From the standpoint of public in~
wrest the Wylmff-Dyer races in the
sprints will be outstanding. Dyer
had the edge when the pair met in the
Southern California-Stanford dual

‘meet, winning the century and ruin
ning to a dead heat in the furIOng.
Last Saturday, Wykoff shattered the
exisiting recognized world's record
in the hundred, running in 9 4—10 sees
onds. Critics are inclined to award
the Trojan dash a slight edge in the
shorter race and to hand the palm
to Dyer in the 220. Some close fol-
lowers of track insist that the Car-
dindi will win both because he is ac—
customed to the wind which almost
invariably blows in the faces of the
runners, down the straightaway, in
the Stanford stadium.

Cirila Slagle returned to he r
home at Strawberry Point for a visit
this week-end.
