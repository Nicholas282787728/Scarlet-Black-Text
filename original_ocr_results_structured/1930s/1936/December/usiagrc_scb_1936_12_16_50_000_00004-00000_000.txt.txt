WELCOME COOPERATION

Seldom has there been a production on
this campus so well received ill the spirit ill
which it was given as were the Chester
Mystery plays presented Friday and Sunday
of this week-end by the drama and music
depaltments.

Credit belongs to the actors, the direc
tors, and their crews which so staged the
plays as to make them comprehensible and
enjoyable as well as making them sustain
the emotional pitch and spirit of the aud—
ience,

But beyond the mere mechanics of ade—
quate staging lies another aspect perhaps
not so obvious. Cooperation on the part
of various college departments ill the pre»
paration of special features of the school
calendar is highly commendable. Apart
from the'actual good experience which it
may afford the individual of working with
those of different interests from his own,
Sllch concentration of effort makes for bet-
ter performances and more congenial un-
derstanding between departments.

And when, as in this production, Grin-
nell townspeople enter into the project, lend-
ing their knowledge of technicalities for a
better production, appreciation by the Shh
dent body is ever more deservediand given.

It is only by such cooperation that the
college can maintain in its unity for more
efficient and pleasurable Sen/ice [032.11.

VALUABLE EXPERIENCE

The subject of extra curricular activities
related to the problems of the world was
recently discussed in chapel by a Grinnell
instructor. The fact was brought ollt that
each campus activity has its parallel ill
community life; for instance, ollr chapel is
related to the churches; student petitions
parallel the initiative of popular govern-
ment; and Uncle Sam’s Club is very much
like social welfare work ill large cities.
Hence, in order to get the most out of their
college life and to fit themselves to carry
their responsibilities as future leaders of
the country, all students should take part
in, and really contribute to, some extra cur~

‘ results of a nationwide poll were revealed.

riclllar activity.

Henry Adams has said that "All expél'—
ience is an arch to build upon,” and il’ stu»
dents learn to adjust themselves while in
college, tlley will not only be happier, but
they will make far more capable citizens of
our country; for they will have learned to
express their own opinions, and to take
their share of responsibilities.

While it is quite true that everyone who
enters outside activities cannot hope to be
a leader, still the intelligent interest that
is manifested is 3 Vital force ill student
problems. Moreover, every student should
analyze each activity he is planning to ell-
Ler, and determine whether the benefits he
receives justify the time he spends ill tak
ing part in the activity,

However, there is the possibility that
student interest may lead to three danger-
ous extremes if cure is not taken, First,
it is a serious f ult for students to neglect
scholastic work in favor of outside illtel sts,
Second, simple details are often magnified
into large issues; and third, there is the
danger that students, in their sheltered life,
may forget that there is a world outside the
campus.

The speaker concluded with the advice
that students should he “covetolls of all that
college has to offer them in experience and
associations, and that they should work out,
with a careful regard for their own abilities
and limitations, a balance between scholastic
effort, interest in wolld affairs, and parti-
cipation in extra curricular activities.”

OFFENDING PUBLIC TASTE
(Daily Trojan)

Why do motion picture theater-s provide double
bills? This mllchrdiscllssed and contloversial ques
tion recently received a. concrete answer when the
Con-
ducted by one of the most widely known corpora
tions in the motion plcture manufacturing and ex-
hibiting field. a total of 725,824 persons were con—
tacted through no colleges and universities
throughout the Country, women's clubs, better films
counmls, parent—teachers association groups, news-
paper editors, radio commentators, and newspaper-
conducted polls.

Did the results show that the so per cent of the
showhouses in the country now offering two feature-
length productions are following this practice be
cause of public demand? oh the contrary, the com-
prehensive canvass showed that 568,751 of the peo-
ple contacted took a deﬁnite stand against the prac.
tips. This is 78 per cent of the total, or a vote of al-
most four to one.

Why is this representative sentiment so deli-
nitely opposed to bargain-day at the neighborhood
picture palace? All of the reasons given may be
grouped into seven classifications.

1. Good pictures are invariably coupled with
poor films, so It is necessary to sit through the
poor picture in order to See the good one.

2. Showmg two features on one bill makes the
program too long. (About four hours.)

3, Audiences like more short subJects, which
are neglected when two features are shown.

4. Pleasure is marred by having to see burl fea-
tures.

5. The long programs result in eyestr-ain, heart
aches, and fatigue,

6. If one picture IS suitable for children. the
other usually is not.

7. Good pictures are often cut excessively in
order to ill dual bills, and as a result are often
jerky.

With, it may be assumed, a majorlty of the
people definitely opposed to being forced to sit
through an extra feature in older to See the film of
their choice, why must the theatel operators
schedule tlllal bills? Surely they, of all people, want
to please their customers. But, the answer is not
to be found so eZISIIy. With the largest production
Schedule in history. involving the making of
more than 600 features by the major studios alone,
at hand. the film peddlers have been forced to find
some outlet for the new product. To do this, they
have rcsolted to a pl'actlce known as “blockrbook-
ing.” In operation, this quaint system demands that
the manager contract for a number of the cheaper
productions of in particular studio in order to receive
one or two of the season’s “big" pictures.

How may a public Which dislikes the plactice
have it removed? Obviously. the solution is m the
hands of this some public, Only protests from the
man-who-bllys»the-tickets Will have any effect upon
the situation.
