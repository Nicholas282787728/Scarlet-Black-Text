Wylie Inventsi
Electric Pacer
for Swimmers

Can you beat the bell?

Now hold on. not the college
hell, or the quad bell. but the
newly installed timing bell which
is designed to aid the varsity and
fresh moi-men in timing their
swimming.

The new pacer, which was de-
signed hy Roy Wylie at thc sug-
gestion of Coach Frank Luomai
consists of an electric clock so or»
ranged that a bell will ring at the

end of each 12, 15 or 20 second pc-,

l'iod, The time when it is to ring
can be regulated by a switch,
when the swimmer desires to he
paced. the coach sets off the
Clock for the desired interval at
the same instant the tankster
plunges in and begins his swim
1f the hell rings hcfore ho has com
pleted the required length. In
knows that he is swimming too

slowly and vice versa, if he {inst

ishcs before the boil.

This device enables the morinan
to accurately dctcrmme his spccd
and to decide whether he needs to
spncd up on the first or second or
last length.

in order to further augment the
timing device. it is planned to in-
stall a sounding board which will
vihratc when the bell rings. and
thus if the swimmer does not hear
the hell he will be able to tail that
his time is up by the vibrations in
the water from the sounding board.

in commenting upon the length
of time nccdcd to swim thc vari-
ous lengths, Coach Luoma said
yesterday, “The sprint events
should take approximately 12 sec-
ends; the middle distance lengths,
15 seconds and the length of tho
too-yard event should average 20

Drive for Valley
Cage Title

By Jim Bradley

Creighton‘s powerful cagcrs
overcome another hazard in the
dash for the Missouri Valley Con-
ference crown here last night,
scoring their sixth loop triumph by
vanquishing n stubhcrn hand of
Cn'nnell Pioneers in a bitter court
hattlc, which ended 40735.

Crinnoll snatched the scoring
lead after two minutes of play
when Hal Dean. guard. dropped
a long range shot fiom the center
of the court for the opening
points. This lead was never relin-
quished until the last six minutes
of play when Creighton’s “checks
ing" defense and "quick .breale
ing" attack came to the rescue of
the Nehrsskahs to function in a
manner perplexing to the Pioneers.
"Box" Englehretson, ‘Busch and
Trish broke past the Grinnell de—
fense on three occasions to tally
the deciding buckets.

First H’alf Gl'inllell's

The opening half was all Grin-
llell, the Pioneers converting
Creighton's misplays into baskets
and slowly pulling away from thc‘
Bluejays to boost the count to 197
11, with Bauer‘s and MCMul'l'ay'S
shooting seconds before the half
guns harked. Big “Box" Engle-i
brctson and Trish narrowed the
margin to 19715 with two quick
blasts at the hoop as the first
period ended.

It was not until midway in the
final stretch that Grmnell showed
signs of cracking Creighton l'cr
