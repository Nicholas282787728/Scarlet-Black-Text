Don’t Get Discauraged;
It Happened Once,
Why Not Again?

was the sad lot of Grinnell stu-
dents in 1919 when a miners
strike and coal shortage caused
the closing of the college. Ac-
cording to the Scarlet and Black
of the time, the first even was an
announcement by the superinten-
dent of buildings and grounds
that there was no possibility of the
college closing for lack of coal.

A few weeks later the college
buildings were being heated only
part of the day. and the students
asked not to open their windows,
Although the college calendar had
announced only one day off for
Thanksgiving, the authorities oc-
cided to lengthen it to four, and
then were forced to inform each
student that they could not come
back at all until more coal was
procured.

College was closed from Nov. 26
to' Dec 31 that year, but spring
vacation was shortened to make
up for the loss of time.

So don't give up, pals! Just be-
cause we have enough coal now is
no sign that it will last. After all.

homsns has expressly stressed is
defense, their theory being that if
they can prevcnt their rivals
from chalking up over 20 or 22
points per game, it is almost as-
sured of a win.

Dick Knieger, diminutive soph-
Vomore forward, is on top in the
Aggies' individual scoring honors.
He has scored so points, while
Smelser, forward, and Merle
Rousey, st. Joseph, Mo, sopho-
more, are tied for second place
with 55 points each.

Grinneil outclassed the Okla-
homans 31-21 on the Punchers'
own floor in the first scuffle bee
tween the two aggregations, and
therein hes a glint of optimism
for a Pioneer victory. Another
decided advantage in favor of the
Scarlet and Black is the fact that
me dispute will be played on the
Grinnell fioor.
