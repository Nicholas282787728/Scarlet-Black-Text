Here Monday Night

Grinnell's iiosh w cstling team
will swing into action for the ﬁrst
timc this season iiondav night at
eight o’clock when the fresh meet
the Newton Y. grapplcrs.

“Although we don't know much
about the Newton team, still I
think that ire have a good chance
of winning," Harold Callaway, stu-
dent wrestling coach, said this
morning. .

“We have a good chance or
taking tivc matches, although we
will he a hit handicapped by the
had knee of Cleve Badger, who
otherwise would he a cinch to win
his match,” Callaway said,

Callaway will wrestle in both
the light and heavyweight classes,
because of the absence of any hea-
vyweight competitor among the
fresh wrestlers. “I will probably be
able to avoid being thrown, and if
the Newton heavyweight does win
by a time advantage. he will get
only three points instead of the
ﬁve that he would get if we de—
faulted."

Probable wrestlers {or Grinnell
are as follows 125 pound class-
