SPARE A DINEE

:rinnell students will have an opportunity during the
next few days to show whether or not they have imbibed
deeply ol' the luv- alned Grinnell spillt. Renewed efforts
tire being made on the part of the student committee for
U llnellrin-Cllillu to secure contributions. and it in this
manner that each student will be given an opportnity to do
his or her part.

The committee realizes that the pockets of college
students are not overflowing with money. novertllcles the '
hope thilt each student. man or woman, can “spare a (lime

if e oh and every one will contribte a small bit, then the
drive will go over with a hang. The goal is $300 and if you
”can spare your dime”. it will be reached lvith no difficulty,

PLEASE MOVE

The action taken by the cllzlpcl committee of the, student
(ollncil recently in attempting to encourage students to take
seats in from of the chapel is indeed commendable.

It certainly is no credit to Grinncll that students herc
have formed the habit of huddling‘ in the back of the chapel,
leaving the speaker with ‘15 or 16 rows of empty seats as all
immediate audience. Nothing is more destructive to good
. raking: and if the students dislike the poor speakers, they
llilv only tllt‘llisoll‘cs to blame in some respects. for their
huddling iii 1he back has resulted in indifferent speaking.

The cooperation oi? all Grinncllihns is essential to break
this IllsCOlll'lFOllS hdhit. Speakers will appr ciatc it more if
you sit down ill fi‘mll. and with an audience that is nearer
to thrill. they can not help but put more punch into their
speeches.

Chapel will improve it' you sit in front, and wllcn you are

family of Great Britain came last.

witc of the caretakcr of the slum
hi Recitation hall, Mrs. Zumwalt
wrote letters of condolence to
King Edward VIII and Queen
Mary. on the death of the late
King George v. She enclosed two
poems composed in honor ot the
occasion, and last week received
replies to_her letters.

The letters are imposing com-
munications, bordered in heavy.
black mourning bands. One heal»

Ushering System

i
Inaugurated

for Daily Chapel :

in an effort to provide a better
audience {or the chapel speakers,
the student chapel committee hasl
arranged to have ushers seat the
people in the front of the chapel
instead of allowing them to con-
grcgate in the back as has been
the custom in the past, it was an—
nonnced today by Clara Munger
and Howard Brogan, chairmen of
the committee, l

‘ch believe that it is highly'
dlscourteous to speakers to ask
them to address a small group in‘
the back of the chapel and 15 or 16
Iempty rows of seats in front," they ,
'said when commenting upon the
new arrangement “We hope that
by having ushers the studcnts will
seat themselves in tront more
ll'cadily.”

It. is planned to have different
organizations furnlsh the ushers
for a week at a time, The ushers
for this week were members of
the Young Women's and the Young
Men’s Christian associations.

Next week the ushers will be ap-
pointed by the house chairmen and
the house presidents at the quadrl
i-angle and dormitories. The role
