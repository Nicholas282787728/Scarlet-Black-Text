in the women's gymnasium,
students have been requested to
rclrnin from smoking on the
balcony during intermission and
between dances, it was an—
nounced yesterday by Lewis

ing is in poor condltiou, and in
addition, the college point and
repair shop beneath the build-
ing stores quantities of paints
mid oils, rind should ﬁre break
out, it would be impossible to
control it,” he sold in explaining
the authorities request.

It has been intimated that un-
less the practice of smoking on
the balcony is stopped. the nu-
thoritics will be forced to ban
dancing in the Molnell's gymna—
sium, he explained.
