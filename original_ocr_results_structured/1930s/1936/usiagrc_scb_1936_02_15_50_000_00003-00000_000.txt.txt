Smith, Kelly
Divide Games

B Team Game Decided
in Closing Seconds

Smith and Rawson halls split
even in their fourth round games
in the men's intramural basket-
ball competition this morning. The
Smith A team chalked up a 16-8
victory over the Kelly A players,
while the Rawscn B team evened
the count by capturing the second
tilt with a surprise finish in the
last 30 seconds of play by a mar-
gin of 16—}5.

Games this afternoon saw Gates
meeting Clark and Dibble tangling
with Lsngan, to complete the
fourth round of intramural play.

The Smith in team had little
trouble overcoming the Kelly ag-
gregation as McLeod,
player, went on an individual scor-
ing spree to garner five of his
team's eight buckets. Smith was
leading eight to three at the half
time period, and continued to cut-
score the Rawson team during the
second half.

The B team game provided the
thrill of the morning. with Raw/son
finally pulling the game out of the
fire in the last few seconds of
play With approximately 35 sec-
onds of- play left in the game, Tay-
lor sank a short shot for Smith af-
ter receivihg the bail on a pass
which bounced off of Referee
High. This made the score 1544
in favor of the southenders, but as
the gun was about to go off, Ellis,
Kelly forward, intercepted a Smith
pass under the southenders' bas-
ket and dropped in the winning
bucket for Rawson

At the half time, the score stood
seven to four in favor of the Smith
aggregation, but « Rawson un-
leashed a scoring drive to gain the
lead and win during the last half.
