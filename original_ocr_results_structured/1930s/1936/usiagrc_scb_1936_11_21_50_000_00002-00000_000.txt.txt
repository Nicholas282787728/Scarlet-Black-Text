A PROBLEM FOR STUDENTS

‘ The need for some adequate provision for a social
dancing floor has long been discussed and a plan has
lately been suggested for consideratlon.

It is proposed that an area 40 feet by ’70 feet be set
aside on the ground floor of the nolth end of the heatlrig
plant for a combined hand-ball court and dance floor. The
latter would be ’70 feet by 20 feet and would extend the
whole north end of the coal storage room. Directly south
of it and parallel to it would be two hand-ball courts each
20 feet by 35 feet. It is hoped that the walls might be so
hinged that they could be raised for dances to make one
large room 40 feet by 70 feet.

The suggestion has been made that the cement floor
he painted and polished rather than that a new hard—
wood floor be laid. AS has been pointed out by the ath-
letic department, this arrangement would not only be un—
satisfactory for the courts but also for dances.

According to the administration, funds are not now
available for the project, at least, not for the dance floor.
It is quite apparent that until the faculty considers the
college’s educational equipment adequate, it can make no
move toward better recreational facilities.

If estimates of about $500 for the cost of the
floor prove correct, it would seem advisable for the Stu-
dent council to launch a drive among the present student
body for funds. The problem is one which directly now
concerns all on the campus, Already several student or
gallizations have expressed their willingness to help ill
financing the project. Wouldn’t such a project b1: pos-

ARMED PEACE, AN ABSURDITY

Mussolin' s recent announcement that there can be
no peace without armaments is enough to make those
who earnestly desire peace to stop and think, especially
since it was followed so closely by a statement from
France, asking funds [or fortifications, Edouard Dala-
dier, defense minister of France, declares that the Ger-
man army may be “ready” (evidently ready for war)
within a year, and he has asked for an appropriation of
approximately 23 million dollars to fortify the northern
frontier of France.

Such announcements cannot but be alarming when
we consider that all nations are rearming on a vast Scale.
According to figures released by the League of Nations
at its last session, there are now 7,600,000 men under
arms, as compared with 5,900,000 just preceding the
Great War in 1913.

When nations are armed to the hilt and are eyeing
one another askance, there is far more chance of war's
actually breaking out at the least provocation than if the
countries were unprepared. It would seem that those
who believe in peace would do well to use their energies
in fighting rearmamcnt and the absurdity known as all
“aimed peace.” ——A. L. B.

Annual Prepping Duties
to End at 6 A. M.
on Sunday

As freshman improvement week
got into full swing this morning
weary underclassmen found them-
selves climbing up and down
stairs backwards, sauntenng
through the night on brief 20
mile hikes, removing yards of
earth to construct trenches for
sham battles, and in general cons
ducting themselves in the manner
prescribed by upperclassmen.

Featuring the prepping period
was the battle royal between the
Smith and Langan hall freshmen,
who this morning were ordered to
demonstrate General Sherman's
famous remark, “war is hell."

Smith frosh, dressed in kilts
borrowed from cooperative women
at the quadrangle, were opposed
by a motley collection of Langan
under-classmen, who might be tok-
en to represent the loyalist dc»
fenders of Madrid in the Spanish
revolution. Both sides entrenched
and fortified their positions dur-
ing the night Each of the prep
soldiers car ed knapsacks con—
taining four bricks, two raw eggs,
two potatoes, pancake flour. tooth-
brush, soap, towel, eating utensils,
picks and shovels.

in Gates hall. the freshmen are
becoming greatly annoyed with
members of the fairer sex who
call up in order to hear the Gates
men recite their little ditty, which
runs as follows:

”I am a freshman from Gates hall,

We love upperclassmen, one and
all,

We have a fine hall,
know,

The best on the campus,
proud to Show."

In addition, members of Gates
hall have been sent on treasure
hunts and given personal tasks to
fulfill.

For the information of those
who have heard a fogrhoi'n voice
bellowing out the time and the
temperature, it is merely the tra-
ditional Clark hull prepping du-
ties. Preps are posted on top of
the building with orders to an
nouncc the time and the tempera—
ture at frequent intervals. In atl-
dition, freshmen answering the
phone must give the time and the
temperature before taking the
message.

Stabiemcn seem to be over~run.

freshmen parade around in their
traditional white overalls, one
obliging upper-classinan loaned the
services of two freshmen to Theta
Sigma. Phi. The co—ed journalists
took advantage lot the offer and
have had the freshmcn parading
through the streets as sandwich
mcn advertising the rummage sale
in progress.

Editor Scarlet and Black.
Dear Sir~

Referring to “Random Sport
Shots" column in the Wednesday
issue of the Scarlet and Black——
reference is made to forming a
conference of Cornell, Coe, state
Teachers, Carleton, etc. and play
ing that kind of a football sched—
ule. In my opinion, football inter-
est never ran so high as it did in
bygone days when the above teams
were Grinnell's chief opponents. I
believe in wrestling they match
two men who weigh sayil’dﬁ
pounds eachiwhy not in football?
Grinnell has a wonderful coach.
fine ball players, and with a mod-
ified schedule winning seasons
could be hrcught about. This is
just the humble unscientific 0pm-
ion of a Crinnell grad who used to
really get excited about Gn'nnell»
Cornell games and other such can-
tests.

Russell George.
Dear sir:

The article appearing recently in
the Des Moines Tribune headed
"‘Withdraw From Valley—Pleads
Grinnell Paper" is not a true state»
ment of the facts. A. sports cole
umnist merely expressed an oplne
ion that had absolutely no basis
as judged by campus opinion, The
misinterpretation is serious enough
to demand a statement from the
editor of our paper to the Tribune
that the article was not an expres.
sion of editorial policy nor ol
campus feeiin

Of course it is to be regretted
that a student writer should be so
zealous of achieving cheap notoiu
iety as to suggest a college policy
that would seriously hurt Grin-
Hell's prestige. And it is further
to be regretted that the editor
should publish such a. story, but
the need for action and not re-
grets is at hand when the article
is published in a large ofﬂcampus
newspaper as one called forth by
student agitation.

As far as the article itself is
concerned it is obvious that such a
withdrawal is against all the tra-
ditions and ideals of Griilnell col-
lege. Grinnell is in a. losing streak
in football, but I do not feel that
Griuuell is ready to admit that

CHRISTMAS

Long Remembered.

ART ‘ROOMS

 

 

Griunelrs ideals are such that ine
stead of trying to withdraw from
a too-strong conference to enter a
weaker one we should welcome
strong, stimulating competition.
When we withdraw from the Mis-
souri Valley conference let it be
to join the Big Ten
Berger Graves.
