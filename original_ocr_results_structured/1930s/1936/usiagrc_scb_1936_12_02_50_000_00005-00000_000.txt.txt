Reporter Sees 1

Future Growth ‘
of Labor Press

(This column is one iii ii series at hr-
ticles iiiitwu by Mr. Serwu', Washingon
correspondent of The Sonnet and Elzdk
and die Associated Collegiltte Press, she is
now touring the east and iniddlcii-est.

By Arnold Semi-er, Correspondent ‘
Milwaukee, Wis.—~Ra_parts 1 have
had from newsmen in this and ad-
joining states, along with my own
observations during travels in
these parts, have led me to cer-
tain conclusions that may be of
interest to young men and women
in our colleges who are seriously
contemplating journalism as a ca-
reer.

These conclusions are to the efr
feet that the country, particularly
the Middle West and the North-
west, is within the next three
years going to see a great boom in
the field of labor journalism.
Weeklies, and in some places even
dailies, are going to spring up by
the score. They will be labor par
pers, devoted to the cause of labor
and mainly supported by labor, In
some cases they will carry labor
news and little else. in other
places they will start with a nu-
cleus of organized labor unionists
as subscribers and on top of that
will try to build a followmg of
readers with liberal tendencies.

Labor Papers Not New

of course. there have been labor
papers nearly as long as there
have been labor unions, But there
have been comparatively few of i
them, located mainly in the great'
industrial centers. But in the next
three years central labor unions
and trades councils in dozens of
smaller cities will be launching
new weeklies, which, if well rim,
will have a very good chance of
surviving.

Two developments of major imr
portance lie behind all this. First,
labor, about to share in a Roose-
velt victory, about to effect the
election of a president in its first
national venture since 1924 when it
backed La Follette, senior, is feel-
ing its political oats. The younger
leaders realize that a labor press
will help labor immeasurably in
its future political endeavors. Sec-
ond, the almost unbroken front
that the Country‘s dailies have
presented against Roosevelt, and
the long standing antipathy of the ,
conservative press to avigorous
labor movement, are pointing out
with dramatic emphasis to these
leaders the importance of building
their own press, so that the cause
of unionism and liberalism may be
adequately represented when im-
portant issues are at stake.

Start On Shoestring

Many of these new papers will
be star-ted on a shoestring. But as
their importance becomes more
evident to the rank and file of la-
bor, they will begin to pay their
way or possibly even begin to show
small profits. As they begin to
widen their appeal by carrying
sports, features, cartoons, and be~
gin to pick up a little advertising
from manufacturers of union label
products, a lot of average Ameri»
can readers with progressive ideas,
disgusted with the die~hard policies
of Tory papers in small industrial
cities, are going to start reading
the new papers. This will he par
ticularly true in towns having only
one paper, a conservative one fail-
ing to realize that the New Deal
has indirectly served to open the
minds of hundreds of thousands of

.sent internal problems,

 

Americans to new ideas.

The new papers will probably
pay their editors very little at
first, and never very much at any
time. They will usually be two-
man papers, having an editor and
a businms manager. They will de-
mand hard work. They will pi'e~
including
fights with labor factions. Theyi
will present external problems. in-
cluding pressure from local sealer
ties, advertisers opposition papers,
and Tory polit ians.

But for any young man or wom-
an interested in labor and liberals
ism, they will afford a chance to
get into some lively fights and to
get excellent experience and train-
ing. Labor leaders will soon be
asking for young people to write
for and edit their papers. As time
goes on, with fewer and fewer
openings available on the estab-
lished dailies, it will be to the
new labor papers that these young
people will turn.

New York, N. Y,7(ACP)7
Pointing out the social, economic,
and political significance of the
recent election at the annual din-
ner of the Chamber of commerce
of the State of New York, Presi-
dent James Rowland Angeli of
Yale university stressed the need
of replanning the whole program
of modern philanthropy.

He warned against any l'eac»
tionary policy which might bring
on a dictatorship in this country,
declaring that if the advantages of
a free democracy were to be :31»
vaged, "we must breed a suffir
ciently vivid form of intelligent
social altruism voluntarily to for-e-
I go some of the individual prero-
gatives which in a simpler day we
could properly and successfully
claim."

Dr. Angeli stated that a new
situation exists which
more serious and thoughtful study,
as the result of the rerentel'ing of
the government on a large scale
into the process of relief.

He said that many whose opin~
ions demand respect foresee rela—
tively permanent programs for
public work and probably a large
amount of direct government aid.
Also the idea that the government
can cure all economic ills through
taxation has a weak basis.

Referring to government welfare
work, Dr. Angeli asserted that the

COLLEGIATE REVIEW

Eddie Boon, an engineering stur
dent at Dolph institute of Tech-
nology in Holland told students at
case School of Applied Science
that America is a heaven because
at its high wages. in Holland,
with about the same standard of
living, a college man gets about
35 a month for summer employ-
ment.

Dr. B. Hemple and Dr. E L.
Gibbs of the Harvard university
medical school have discovered
that the brain wavcs in a cat core
respond closely to those‘found in
man.
