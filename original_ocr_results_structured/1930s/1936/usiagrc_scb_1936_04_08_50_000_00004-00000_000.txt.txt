COOPEltATION NEEDED.

When spring football drills opened today
Grinnell students found the Pioneer squad
working out under the direction of a new
coach, Guy Lookabaugh, a former star of a
sister school in the Missouri Valley confer»
ence, Oklahoma A.&M.

In a speech to the men of Grinnell Monday
night, Mr. Lookabaugh emphasized the fact
that the team will not be his team nor will it
be the football player team. It will be Grin»
nell's team and it will only be successful with
the whole~hearted support of the student
body.

It will be the job of the new coach to teach
the players the principles and fundamentals
of football. He is not a miracle man and the
student body should not expect him to bear
the burden of setting the Grinnell football
house ill order. He will need and rightfully
should expect the utmost cooperation of the
players, who will make up the ieftm and of
the student body who will supply the enthu-
siasm and spirit which is necessary to sue
cess. We‘ve all got to cooperate,

WHA'f ABOUT PUBLICITY?

Examples of famous American press sen—
sationalism have been much in evidence dur-
ing the past few weeks, Pictures of the
Horton trial audience at lunch ill the court-
room, a composite one of the Hauptmann
execution, and one of the child, Manfred
Hauptmann, consoling his mother, are parti»
culurly notable, Pictures of this type are
propaganda pure and simple and are not
worthy of the title “news pictures." They
appeal to the lower instinct of men, the ill-
stinct that is constantly avarlcious for news
of human suffering.

Newspapers and magazines which feature
the “true story~the inside dope—for the
first time” encourage publicity seekers with
offers of fabulous sums for the exclusive
rights to the story. And even if the journals
do not pay cash for the story, everyone real—
izes that a little publicity usually helps ill the
money-making game. Paul Wendel, one of

THE GRINN'ELL SCARLET AND BLACK

the many suspects in the Lindbergh case, was
attracted by vision of fortune to make his
confession. DI: J. F. (Jafsie) Condon and
his acceptance of a vaudeville offer after his
admitted part ill the same case is a good ex
ample of a man who found such publicity
valuable.

Such dramatic exposure of the “truth” is
not freedom of the press—it is rather exploii
tution of the press and as such should be
stamped out.

Granted real news is in itself more 01' less
sensational, still it need not be made more so
by over-emphasis, by use of poor taste.

For years the struggle for “enough truth”
was waged ; “OW the struggle must be against
too much truth. “Conservatism" must be

the new cry.

BE PREJUDICED
(Daily Trojanl

Prejudice. What is it?

Defined variously as “substitute for thinking,"
“obstacle to progress," and “chief possession of a
little mind," one wonders if not this frequently
maligned mental bias docs not have a place in tlic
mind of tlre intelligent person, Why should not perc
sons arrive at some definite, wellrfounded preju-
dices as concern certain principles important to
moral, mental fortitude after a due process of rea-
soiling? Why should not every thinker decide upon
a few basic concepts to which he will hold, despite
any efforts of propagandlsts to destroy or wary
them?

\ These prejudices, ccrtainly, should not be adopt-
ed, or second—hand ones, but good, new, first—hand
ones which result from sound, logical thought. ,

Advocate a closed mind? Never! But every
adult should have some mental armor which will
protect him from undue persuasion of the vacillatlng
mob about him. A completely open mind is one which
has never grown up. It is a childish, immature
thing which never pauses to consider those ideas
which pass through or over it. Would not a mind
be better which, at least. sieved the material passing
through it to separate the Valuable from the mic
valuable, the abiding from the epliermal, the good
from the evil? Why should not a fcw sound tenets
serve as wires in this sicvc for mental food and
drink?

American patriots, among others, would leave
little to fear from “the insidous elements striving to
undermine our institutions" if every thoughtful citir
zen bad a few sane. basic prejudices in his mental
armor to use as weapons on these or any other of
society’s dread forces.

3 $ FOR, DUENED FOOLS

(Washington student Life)

In spite of the fact that it is in its infancy, we
are proud to glvc our whole-hearted support to the
Veterans of Future Wars. There is cold logic in the
veterans appeal, If we wait for our bonuses in the
normal course of events, we will be too old to enjoy
them, or Worse yet we may be dead. So let's have
them now when our cash is low and our spirits high

We at Washington U. would carry the plan
originated at Princeton even further. At present an
intensive drive is under way to get funds for the
construction of a tomb for the unknown and as yet,
perhaps, unborn soldier who will be killed in the, as
yet. unfougnt war. With the consent of the Uni-
versity authorities, this tomb will probably be placed
in the center of the main quadrangle, and will be
surrounded with festoons of flowers.

We also strongly urge the creation of a practice
field hospital on the campus for the purpose of
training the future Red Cross war nurses here in
their work. The WPA could probably be counted on
to finance the project, astbcrc are not enough jobs
created by the WPA for women anyway, and with
the exception of a few isolatcd cnscs tnc fcmlnlnc
interests have been sadly neglected in this (le-
presslon.

We feel that in giving our support to this
movement we are fulfilling tnc highest type of
journalistic endeavor and are aiding in a, movement
that will do much to increase the prosperity of the
country at large.

“Never did royalty receive more

each other in making theirs the
greatest ovation of all. throwing
open the doors of the finest resi-

bouquets, and driving them about
their beautiful little cities in pri-
vate carriages, At Union and

crowded to overflowing, and the
