16 Religious Faiths
Represented on Campus,
Survey Indicates

Sixteen different religious de-
nominations are represented
among Grinnell college students
this year. Of the 746 students,
listed in the survey, 491 showed a
preference for the Congregation-
ai, Methodist, or Presbyterian
church. Two students are Evan-
gelicalists, one is a United Brethe
and one is of the Moslem
‘aith.

There are about 15 Protestant
churches in Grinneli. However,
there are not churches represent-
ing all of the religious preferences
or the students. The Unitarian,
the Jewish. the Reformed, and the
United Brethren churches are

‘ among those which have no regu-

lar, organized church. The Epis<
copal church in Grinnell was
forced to discontinue regular ser-
vices several years ago, because of
lack of sufticient interest in the
organization. Since then visiting
ministers have held Episcopalian

 

services in the Associations build-

SATURDAY, OCTOBER 31, 1936:

ing the first Sunday of every
month,

For several years, Sunday
school classes for college students
were held at the congregationa.
and Methodist churches. At the
congregational church, various
college professors and other peo-
ple interested in students were in-
vited to speak before the class.
So few students. however. showed
any enthusiasm for attending the
class, that it was dropped

This year, Mary Jane Peck and
Browne Barr, chairmen or church
and school relations for the Young
Women’s Christian association and
Young Men’s Christian associa-
tion respectively, attempted to
start the classes again, hut they
found little interest. At the Bap-
tist church, a class is open to col-
lege students and persons above
high school age.

Despite the general lack of end
thusiasm ror attending a Sunday
school class, there an: several
college men and women who are
teaching classes for younger peo-
ple at the Grinnell churches.
