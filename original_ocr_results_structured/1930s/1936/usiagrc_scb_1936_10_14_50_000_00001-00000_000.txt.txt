Famed Avatrix Relates

Experiences in Talk
Last Night

By Janice Fitter

“For speeds of over 40 miles an
hour, get into the air for safety,“
declared Amelia Earhart Putnam,
world‘s foremost aviatrix, as she
spoke on her “Aviation Adven-
tures" before an audience of Grin-
nell college and townspeople at the
Congregational church last night.

“I want to give one statistic for
the evening. Based on the average
flying which the average person
does in this country, you will be
123 years years old before any ac-
cident occurs to you.”

No Scientific Interest

Explaining that she had no
scientific incentive for flying, Miss
Earhart said, “My own WISh to do
so is my sole excuse for flying,"
and later added, “The lure of ﬂy
ing is the lure of beauty, and I
need no other flight than the Pa-
cific one to convince me that the
reason people fly is the aesthetic

Clad in a jaunty formal gown of
deep blue figured satin with a
white tailored, long-sleeved jacket,
Miss Earhart immediately struck
the keynote of informality and
vivacity which was to hold
throughout her talk by deploring
the ability of everyone to mistake
her for most any woman whose
picture had appeared in the news-
papersl

In commenting upon the success

“I hope for the day to come i
when there will be no choice be
tween men and women in careers.
but only between indi iduals,”
Amelia Earhart, noted aviatrix,
said in an interview yesterday
morning She is Consultant in Ca.
reers for Womcn at Purdue uni-
versity. ”And then 1 put on
false whiskers and double as com
sultant in Aviation,” she chuckled.

Miss Earhart looks exactly like

rumpled, strong features, though
delicately modeled, with practical»
ly no make—up, She was wearing
a brown tailored suit and brown
oxfords, with a blue, brown, and
yellow plaid blouse. Over her arm
were two coats, one a brown tai-
lorcd suede, the other mink.

Pep Chairman
Resigns Post

Too Many Jobs, Cause
Spence to Quit

John Spence, coachairman of the
pep committee for the last year
and a half, resigned his position
this week because of too many
activities. His place as cochain
man of the pep committee will be
taken by William Callaway '37.

Spence, in announcing his resigr
nation, said, “1 don‘t feel that i
can handle the job properly with
all of my other activities, and
that if I continued to try and car-
ry on the pep chairmanship, I
would be doing the school an in—
justice."

He is manager and bookkeeper
for the new centralized laundry
and cleaning service, installed in
the dormitories and quadrangle
for the first time this year, meme
ber of the varsity football team,
and is social chairman of Clark
hall.

William callaway, the newly
selected co»pcp chairman, is a res-
-deut of Gates hall, and has been
a member of the house council for
two years.

Callaway, along with Jean McA
Elravy, will have charge of all
the pep activities on the campus.
They will direct the pep dances,
rallies and any other activities
that may be planned. Both will
be members of the Student conn-
cil. They will hold office until
next spring when new officers will
be chosen at the annual student
council elections.

Two books, “20 Hours, 40 Mills
utcs" and “The Fun of It" are to
her credit, besides numerous mag-
azme articles. Miss Earhart claims
that she has had no specific trains
ing in writing, except the usual
college courses. “one in editorial
writing was of the most help,”
she said, Her publisher husband,
George Palmer Putnam, has given
her much valuable advice, as
well.

“'riting- Mostly Work
”But after all, I believe in the

old saying that ‘Wi‘lLing is more‘

the application of the seat of the
pants to the chair than anything
etse,"‘ she laughed Miss Ear-
hart carries a typewriter with her
in her creamrcoloi'ett Cord
ster, and is doing some writing
now. but she declined to tell what
sort of work it is.

Miss Ear-hart drove in yesterday
morning from a speaking engage-
ment at Moline, 111..
tomorrow to LaSalle, ill. “1 never
look at my schedule more than
:wu jumps ahead," she stated, Her
trip this year will last about six
weeks.

No long trip is planned for the
near future, she said, but she will
return to Purdue where she is in—
terested in research work in avia—
tion. Her particular field is the
study of human reactions to fly
ing, a field so far only slightly ex—
plored.
