Dr. O‘sgood'iContradic‘ts Italian Reports
of Huge Successes in Ethiopia

Naturalist Explains Why
Natives Remain
Unconquel‘ed

“Reports of Italian victories over
Ethiopian troops are about iivc
per cent correct; Italy has not con-
quered the people as the near fu-l
Lure will soon Show," Dl'. VViIri
{red H. Osgood. naturalist and ex-
plorer from the Field Museum,
Chicago, in his discussion or Ethio~i
pm Tuesday night at the strand
theatre emphasized this point
along with the [act that the Ethio-
pians are intrinsically a fighting-
people, that [ran] the cradle to the
grovc, the people think only of do
fending the country. .

“The government of the country
is [elldalistin." he said, “and the
hereditary ruler is still all-power-
ful." This paternalistic idea has
developed the natives into excel.
lent material for armies. for they
are used to obeying their masters.
he further explained. some of the
troops have been highly trained
by Europeans, but all cling to that
belief that God is on their Side and
that men are better than machines,

said the speaker. "He is thought-

to Ethiopia. Since coming into
full power in 1930. he has been
able to carry out his modern ideas

Dr, Osgood stated that the coun-
try has one foot in the middle
ages an the other in the League
of Nations as one can easily see
when he compares the primitive
culture of the lowlands with the
more odvnneed civilization of Atl-
dis Ahaba and the highlands. The
lowlands, occupying anarthil‘d the
nrca. he said, are of little impor-
tance expept as strategic barriers

“The pcople,‘ he said. “are fine
physical specimens, well able to
take care of themselves, usually
quick and competent. They are
a mixed race but not a black one,
the true negro type being in the
slave class, A consistent effort is
being made to rid the country of
slavery without war although the
condition of the slave is not much
inferior to that of the other ll be

He pointed out that the mineral
resources of the country are still
prospects although in all probabil-
ity they exist to quite a considera-
ble extent.

“The greatest asset of Ethiopid
is the people,” the speaker coir
eluded “If nny nation could gnin
control of them, they would surely
have powerful help in militaristic
maneuvers. Unless the League‘s
plans for peace succeed, it is hkely
that righting will still he going on
