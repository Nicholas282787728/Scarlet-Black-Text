Suendsen Shows
Adjustment

Needs of Co-eds

“Besides the common interest of
earning a. livelihood, we all have
one other, that of learning how to
get ourselves accepted by others
so as to get their confidence and
friendship." This latter interest
was the basis of the talk, “The
Past Experience of the Freshman
as it Affects Her College Career,"
given by Miss Margaret Svendsen
this morning in the quadrangle
drawing room.

Miss Svendsen is n research psy-
chiatric worker from the Illinois
Institute for Juvenile Research.

“It is strange that we should
have minimum academic require-
ments for college entrance and no
personal and social development
requirements," she said, “It has
been stated," she continued, “that
the chief mnction of higher educa»
tional institutions is to train the
mind; granted that this is true,
can we stop here? Doesn't this
attitude assume that the family
training has been wise and that
the elementary school experience
has been adequate." Miss svend-
sen asked.

Home Life Important.

Emphasizing the fact that home
life plays probably the most im»
portant role in the social develop-
ment of the individual, the speaker
said that too much responsibility
for unpopularity is placed on the
girl herself. The need is to see
the tragedy of the first few weeks
against the background with which
the girl has come to college, she
continued.

Leaders of freshmen should ask
themselves these questions, Miss
s endsen said, Is the girl an only
eh id, how many times has she
been away rrom home, has she
ever visited this or any other came
pus, does she have friends in this
or any other college, what were
her interests in high school. has
she held any honorary positions.
what is the size of the community
from which she comes?

Four Freshman Needs.

The speaker pointed to four
needs with which the freshman ar-
rives on the campus: that of close
relationships to take the place or
her family, that to feel herself ac.
cepted as she is by her family,
that of the urge to make new
friends and to become the part of
an intimate group from which to
get styles of dress and habits, and

’has not voted on the question of

 

that to have a good time.

Discussing particular problems
of new girls on the college campus.
Miss Svendsen said that the girl
who has been too much dominated
in the family will either lean on
her roommate, she may withdraw
completely into herself, she may
become superior to the popular, or
she may become aggressively dom-
inant just as she has been treated
in the past.

The girl whose community has
had no co-edncational recreational
facilities has a real problem in her
adjustment to a coeducational
campus life, the speaker said.

PROPER AGING

Tobacco in its natural state is harsh and strong.
Though ”cured” by the grower before sale,
it is unsuited for use without further aging.
During this aging period (which ranges in
the case of Lucky Strike from 1% to 3 years)
important changes occur. These “Nature”
changes result in the partial ”smoothing out”
of the originaI harsh qualities of the leaf.
Our process of manufacture carries these
improvements many steps further—as
every Lucky Strike Cigarette exempliﬁes:
A Light Smoke of rich, ripe-bodied tobacco.
