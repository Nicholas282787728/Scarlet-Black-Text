WHY HURRYING FEET?

This summer when tramping student feet quit the
campus for three months, it was possible to get a, fairly
good plot of grass on the lawn ill front of the college
library. But within the week after school has been ill
session, that well-kept lawll has become a thing of the
past.

In the rush with which most of us burden our lives
for unaccountable reasons, we forget that well-groomed
campuses are one means by which a college lawn is dis-
tinguished from :1 grade-school yard. We expect eight
and nine year olds to heedlessly cut ugly paths, but it is
a general supposition that as we get older we outgrow
childish and wasteful habits, and this assiduous "cutting”
is surely childish and wasteful.

Fences are unsightly. Therefore as a corrective for
a habit which, apparently, no amount of talking will
effect, we recommend it hedge similar to the one which
bowlers the front walk leading to ARH. Not only would
i' is allow the grass to grow unhampered, but it would
also be inexpensive and add grwtly to the general attrac—
tiveness. J. P.

THE AMERICAN STUDENT UNION

“Isn’t the American Student union, a socialist or—
ganization?" is a question asked by some who have heard
rumors and not much more about the union. No, the
American Student union was organized by students with
the ideal that the student movement of America should
be organized for strength just as the student movements
in many other countries are organized.

Last winter 500 students from all over the country
met in the Columbus, 0. Young Mens Christian Associa-
tion to organize the student movement. About half of
these were members of the Student League for Industrial
Democracy, ol nally socialist, and the National Student
league, originally communist; and half were from all
kinds of discussion clubs, religious groups, l' aterllities,
Reserve 01 icers Training Corp and other organlzations.
At this originating convention the American Student
union was formed super-cedingr the Student League for
Industrial Democracy and the National Student league,
which then ceased to exist. Tile first declaration of
policy includes such universally acceptable planks as,
defense of academic freedom, opposition to the war pre—
parations of the government and the R. 0. T. 0., and
increased educational facilities and student relief.

In Syracuse university, especially, a constant attempt
is made by the local A. S. U. to keep the radical elements
lll the background by electing a, conservative president
and cooperating with the university administration. That
is only right for the Student union should be truly repre-
sentative of the American students, most of whom are
not radical. Still we must remember our debt to the
radicals who have pushed the Union‘ so wholeheartedly
and have done away with their own organizations for it.
Only as more students join the American Student Union
will it be more representative of us.

Freshman Cirl Reveals Thrills
of “Bumming” Around Country

9
M. E. Babb Spends Summer

With Youth Hostelers
on Pacific Coast
By Elisabeth Auii Waller

Girls seldom go “humming,” but
that is what Mary Elizabeth Bebb,

lit freshman in Main hall, did this

summer. Only she did more; she

championed a cause, that of Yollthl

Hosteling, by lecturing and show»
in the towns
along the Pacific coast.

Accompanied by Betty Blodgctt
of Mt. Holyoke, Mary Beth drove
Toss the United States with a
group of young people traveling to
Japan under the auspices of the
Youth' Hostelers, an organization
begun five years ago to promote
travel for young people as an ex»
periment in international livlngi
:‘to build peace through seeking
friendships with the young people
of other countries.”

Live on Dollar a Day

On the long drive one dollar a
day was allowed for food and lodg-
ing. Two persons took charge of
the arrangements each day. De-
pending on the tastes of these two,
the ginup either dined magnifi-
cently and slept on the ground, or
ate meagerly and slept in soft,
comfortable beds.

Breakfast and supper were usual-
ly eaten outdoors, breakfast cone
sisting of milk, raw oatmeal, nuts
and raisins mixed together. Mary
Beth assures everyone that the
combination is simply grand, es»
pecially when you are hungry and
there is community enthusiasm.
“But don't try it when you are
alone," she warns.

Talks Euthusiastieauy

Mary Beth's dimples deepen and
her wide eyes sparkle as she talks
about her and "Bet’s" experiences.
She sits cross—legged on the floor,
and her descriptive hands move
quickly, emphasizing some point
or punctuating a remark.

For nine nights, while they
toured the Olympic peninsula, the
two girls slept outdoors in sleep
mg bags, As they came down
the coast, they stopped overnight
in Campfire girls' and Girl Scouts‘
camps, at tourist cabins, or in the
homes of people interested in help-
ing establish Youth Hostels in the
West.

. Visit San Francisco

In Sun Francisco Mary Beth
spent an afternoon trying to elutle
a woman who rattled on about
communism. “That's why rm not
a Communist,” says Mary Beth.
it was in San Francisco that they

[stayed in the employees quarters

of a settlement house. “Much as
we love the outdoors and travel, it

was perfect to be in really lived»,

in rooms with books and dishes
and things.”

The Globe theatre at the San
Diego fair attracted their attenr
tion. and they soon became ace
quaihted with the English folk
dancers, a group of young people
who lovtd to “cut-up” backstage.

_ Stop in Mexico

In Ess‘lenaldo,- Mean, they did
their Christmas shopping and
picked up many amusing and in-
teresting trinkets which now dec-
orate Mary Beth's room. Before
they returned to the middle weste
they both live in Chicago—they
had collected enough National park
stickers to almost cover the car
windshield, slept in a convent and
on a haystaek, and had “such fun"
everywhere. Their sunday clothes,
brown culottes, were worn out

sliding down Mt, Hauler, and
Mary Beth had lost her lcdeihosen,
leather shorts she had purchased
in Bavaria, which she wore when
performing folk dances or givlng
talks, and which she used as a pil-
low when she slept out.

Last year Maly Beth traveled
through Germany, Czechoslovakia
i and Holland With another group of
Youth Hostelers Dorothea Def-
fellbzlugh, another freshman, made
the same trip this summer. Small
glollps of secondary school and
college students lived for one
month in the home of some foreign
boy or girl and for another month
hiked, climbed, or bicycled through
the scenic country. Deiothea has
blought her bicycle with her. You
can see it on third floor Main or
in front of the bookstore.
