Steiner Pleads I
for Retention

of Daily Chapel l

A plea for the continuation of
chapel as an institution where
students and faculty may feel at
home and at peace with each
other. and where each may come
to know the other better was}
made Thursday morning by Dr.
Edward A. Steiner. Rand profes-
sor of applied Christianity, as his
part in the discussion of the
chapel problem.

The speaker reminded his audi-
ence that such periods could be
made moments of spiritual inspir-
ation for all, pointing out the ex-
ample of a former professor, who,
a number of years later, told how
the daily chapel periods had been
the high spots of his stay at Grim
hell. '

Dr, Steiner continued. asserting,
“Chapel is a tradition at Grinnelli
a tradition to whose standard no
other similar service in all the
colleges I have visited could ap~
preach."

Bagdad Doesn’t Seem Fabulous City

‘When Described by Mohammed Said

StudentfromMesopoiamia‘its people in a small college than

Tells Interviewer
of Home Life

You may think of Bagdad as a
fabulous city ol' the Arabian
nights, full of mystery and orient»
oi splendor, but. you'd never get
that idea from seeing or talking
to Mohammad Said, a new Grin-
nell student from that city. He is
in this country on a scholarship
from the Mesopotamian govern-
ment. Thirty~five of his country
men are in American colleges and
univers ies. preparing to take
government positions when they
return to iraq.

You may have seen Mr. Said on
the campus and not even realized
that he is a foreigner, for he looks
and dresses very much like the
rest or us. He is very dark, and
rather short.

“My father adopted western
dress eight years ago, and so did
1," he said. “Beforer that we wore
a sort of robe and fez,"

“I shall enter the diplomatic
service when I return," Mr. Said
declared last night. “My country
requires that I spend two years at
home after I receive my B. A.
degree. and before I apply for my
master‘s,” he said.

When his government appointed
Mr. Said as one of its foreign stuv
dents, it stipulated that he spend
a year first at the American uni-
versity at Beirut, Syria, in order
to become somewhat accustomed
to Western ways. “I made good
grades in everything but English,"
he stated. “but they let me go
throug Mr. Said’s English is
quite perfect now, except for a
slight accent.

He studied for two years at the
University of Chicago, living at
International house. There he met
David Saxe, Crinnell ex '30, who
convinced him that he would leam
more about the United States and

 

in a large university.

“Everyone has been much
more friendly to me since 1 have
been here,” Mr. Said declared, He
praised the dormitory system for
its friendliness and democracy.
He has not yet decided on his
nlajor or minor, but is taking
courses in political science, ecov
nomics. history, French and Eng—
lish as background for his diplo-
matic work,

Bagdad. his home, is in a stage
of transition from the oriental to
the occidental, as is the dress of
the people, The city has no mod-
ern skyscrapers, since the soil is
shifting and soft, not of a type
to support steel construction, he
declared.

550 junior colleges in the United
States.

Freshmen of the 1940 class at
the University of New Meidco can
now wear corduroy pants, They
were given this privilege recently
because of the economy of the
