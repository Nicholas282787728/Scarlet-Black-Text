years was only slightly above the
number dying in the tight to gain
possession of this territory.

Not Determined

“Migration is not determined by
political control nor does it have
the large determining effect on
employment we are led to believe,"
Dr. Clark stated.

The speaker further said that car
lonial expansion is not profitable
in trade, as has been argued, and
pointed out that Germany has
spent 100 million marks more ri-
nancing the administration of ex-
pansion than the total value of all
the colonial trade.

The speaker continued, pointing
out that until 1300 expansion was
profitable to the taxpayer since
governmental expenses were met
by revenue from the trade com»
panies, but as England and others
began to realize that to keep out
of war in Europe they had to get
better control of trading com—
panies outside or Europe, they pro.
ceeded to acquire that authority.
This meant, he explained, that gov-
ernments with the aid of the tax—
payers would pay the price of the
enterprises, while the individual
companies would heap the profit.

But troubles within their own
boundaries occupied European na-
tions trom 1800 to 1875 and there
was little interest in colonies, he
said, and went on to explain that
by 1880 Europe was settling down
and releasing energy and money
for expansion.

Mrs. Colby Speaks
on ‘Quest for Peace’

Contrasting the “War Genera-
tion” and the "Children of the
Armistice,” as she labeled the
present generation, Mrs. Ruth
Gage colby of Minneapolis, Minn.
spoke yesterday afternoon on
“The Quest for Peace," the second
talk in the International Rela-
tlons conference series.

"I believe that your generation
is infinitely wiser than the last;
that it would be impossible to
call war by another name and
deceive you," Mrs. Colby said.

Presents Documents
She presented three documents

 

concerning the outbreak of the
war: a. conﬁdential cablegram
from an American official in Eng-
land stating the necessity for de-
claring war in order to avert a
financial panic in the United
States and protect our loans to
the Allies; President Woodrow
Wilson's address to Congress in
which he gave our high-sounding
motives for declaring war on the
Central Powers; and a letter
from a young man to David starr
Jordan, attempting to explain Why
the former had broken up a
peace meeting in 1917,

“These documents represent the
cold-heartedness of a. statesmen,
the Capitulation of a president,
and the crusading spirit of youth
gone wrong," she declared.

Personal Emperiences

MX‘S. Colby described the emptir
ness ot a college campus, both
spiritual and physical, when the
classrooms were drained of men
[or the war. She told of her exei’
periences as B. hostess in a canton-
ment and in the Great Lakes
naval base, \vhere the incumbly
wounded were sent. ‘

“Dedicate yourselves to savingi
civilization, not by brute force,
but by intelligence," she advised,

Concerning the attitude of the
war generation toward the youth
of today, Mrs. Colby said, “We
can bury our pl‘eludices, tears,
and hates, but we cannot forgeti
We will never counsel violence.
War won't help. It kills tnlth.
faith, morals and religion as it
kills men, and they are harder
to replace, Asking repulsion of
war is not asking you to discard
patriotism, but to uphold a pa-
triotism founded on national love,
which takes more courage than
war ever took,”

‘War Achieves Nio
Objectives’—Lane

“War is wrong. War is stup-
idly futile." This was the heart
of the address made at Vespers
in Herrick chapel, Friday aftei'r
noon by the Rev. Stoddard Lane
of the Plymouth Congregational
church of Des Moines.

“The cost in lives and money
is not only appalling, but war
has failed miserably to achieve
even one of the objectives for
which we fought," Dr. Lane state

Incurroxnled

In his address he declared that
it is not human to kill, contrary
to the opinions of many. “You
cannot make men kill until you
make them hate. Then they will
kill, You cannot wage wars witlr
out lies and atrocity stories
which Will make men hate and
kill," he continued.

Four principles advanced by
propagandists explaining our ene
trance into the war were not
achieved, lie said, We fought to
protect the helpless women and
children of Belgium, to make the
world safe for democracy, to put
an end to militarism, and to end
all wars,

“However," Dr. Lane continued,
“thousands of helpless women
and children were killed in an
effort to protect them. The
world is more unsafe for demo-
cracy than at the outbreak of
the world war. Militarism has
gone stark mad. Bedlam is about
to break as black clouds hover
over Europe.”

“But it is not too late,” be con
cluded, and explained that we can
contribute toward world peace if

lwe intelligently educate ourselves

and others, co-operate for peace
through the League of Nations,
resort to political action, and
have faith in peace.

Schultz Analyzes
Agricultural Problem

“America holds the key for re-
stabilizing international trad
declared Dr, T. w. Schultz. pro-
fessor of agricultural economics
at Iowa state college, in address-
ing the international Relations
conference this morning.

“We are in the same position
as England after the battle ot
Waterloo, If we make the first
step England will undoubtedly

follow suit, for she is tired or her
present policy of nationalism," the
speaker went on.

Nature Helps.

In speaking of America's agri-
cultural trade cutlets, Dr. Schultz
said that although recovery and
rising prices have set in they do
not mean that we have solved
the question of foreign markets,
Instead, Nature has given us a
breathing spell by the drouth’s
curtailment of crop production.

Dr. Schultz also pmnted out
that Central Europe is still iso-
lated from us in an economic
way and this situation should be
remedied.

The talk was based on three
assumptions: that real gain can
be had from international trade,
