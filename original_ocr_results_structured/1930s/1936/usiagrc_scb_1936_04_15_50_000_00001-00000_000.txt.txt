Honor G Club Urges
Wearing of Prep Caps

Plans for strict enforcement of
the rules regarding the wearing of
freshman prep caps and general
smoking on the campus have been
drawn up by the men's Honor G
club.

“Freshmen will be required to
start wearing their prep caps toe
marrow," according to the ruling
of the club. The same rules will
govern the wearing of the caps as
in the fall.

“There has always been an un»
written tradition against smoking
on the campus, especially in the
vi nity of the Alumni Recitation
hall, but of late this tradition has
been consistently violated, and we
are planning to put a stop to this
practice,” the club ruled recently.

Scrimmage

Grid Squad Will Start
Work Thursday

By Jim Bradley, _

The spring football squad will
taste its first scrimmage Thurs~
day afternoon according to Coach
Guy Lookabaugh, grid mentor.

The practice sessions so far have
largely been taken up with kick-
ing, passing, dummy blocking, play
timing and light tackling. By
Thursday afternoon, the candidates
are expected to know their posi-
tions and duties for 24 plays off
the double wing formation and
scrimmage will actually start.

McLeod, veteran halfback and
kicker, and Barker, 195 pound
freshman fullback, have looked
best during the punting drills, as
both men have been booting the
pigskin beyond the fifty yard
mark.

The practices have been such
that the outstanding talent on the
Pioneer roster has not had a
chance to make a showing. In
dummy scrimmage, flashes of
speed has been exhibited by the
backfield. Luther, Robinson, Mar
Leod, Livermore and White, all
backs, are a small lot, but possess
great inhuman speed. Barker is
the only heavy ball toter out for
the spring drills. Bill Sampson
and Schlotterheck, veteran backs.
