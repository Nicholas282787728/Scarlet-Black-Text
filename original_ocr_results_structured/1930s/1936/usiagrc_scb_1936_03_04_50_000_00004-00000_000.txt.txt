THINK BEFORE YOU VOTE!

As the time approaches for the election of
the members of the Student Council, the Collu-
eil of House Presidents, and the Women's
League Board, Grinnell students might well
pause and ask themselves, “Just what is tllo
matter with Grillilell'?” Grinnollians should at-
tempt to discover those faults whioh nlilst ho
overcome in order that there may bo, llettor
men’s government, better women’s government
and better campus government.

It has been all all too frequent oronrronoo
in the past that our student. elections hllvo lloon
more popularity contests instead of the moans
of placing responsihle students in the impor-
tant executive positions. The idea lllat a
limit should be elected to fl position l'egnrdloss
of his qualifications, merely brcauso ho is well
liked, should be changed, for the l rolls -
nuances of this attitud have been evident tlus
year and ill past years ill mlmy quarters of tho
campus.

Griunell can be proud of one thing—that
our campus is not controlled by tho, typo, of ii
ternity politics which appears in many rollrgos,
In such cases, the elections are taken muoli too
seriously, and a bad situation often provnils.
But Gr mell students uphold the other cxtromo.
and Grinnell is suffering the consequeno '.

Shall our student elections ho. prizoliality
contests with a hit-and-mis ohanoo of electing:
a responsible person to offioe, or shall we coir
sidor carefully whether a candidate is oapahlo
of executing the duties of tho, offioo, to whioll
he may he elected?

If Grinllell is to retain her high position ill
student government and student rospmlsillility.
her students must adopt the latter point of
View, that is obvious Popularity does not lnoan
ahility, hut ability is needed hadly.

Slop then and think llefol't‘ you \lnto.

Read it. and weep in the New Masses: “There
is one hope in the world: Communism. Everything
else has been tried and has failed." What this coun-
try needs is a good five—cent revolution.
