WATCHWORD CARRIED OUT

Good sportsmanship is awatchword in
college athletics, yet seldom is the spirit of
the word so well carried out as by our base
ketloall coach, John C. Truesdale.

Few athletes or coaches are deliberately

poor sports, yet by their lack of restraint
in the face of hard going they sometimes
give that impression. By contrast, Trues—
dale‘s ability to practice the principles of
good sportsmanship, be a good loser, and re-
member that the game, not the victory, is
the thing, is worthy of special recognition.
, We might add that there have been
cases where the spectators might gain, not
only in their own enjoyment of the game
but in the reputation of Grillnell, by imitat-
ing his example.

THE GRINNELL SCARLET ‘AND BLACK

CAMPUS HEADQUARTERS

The daily grind of college life tends to
make us pessimistic about almost everything
and leads us to vociferous criticism of our
lot. Then every once ill a While some in,
dividual or group brings a real idea which
dispells the gloom. ‘

At tlle top of ideas ill this categolvae
place the new White housc alld Mrs. Bishop,
the hostess. ‘

Though the life of this new addition to
our campus has just begun, it is already,
under Mrs. Bishop’s direction, becoming a
tangible asset to the social life of the col-
legc.

We have on several occasions dropped in
there during the last few days and always
We find the building in use by groups of
students, relaxing, playing, or just plain
talking, but all enjoying the freedom and
naturalness of the place. It is ill other
words a success as a real campus head—
quarters for students.

Gr

swmo IS IE3? TO saw

of late we have been coming to the con—
clusion that the modern musical madness
called swing was on the wane, and, to be
frank, we were not too seriously disappoint—
ed. But the events which have transpired
at the last two basketball games have made
us change our opinion.

Twice now we have seen a crowd, watch-
ing a crack basketball team strut its stuff,
whipped into a frenzy of what is usually
called school spirit by a band representing
pep incarnate. To say Chet Williams and
the boys surprised us is to understate the
effect. They stole the show despite the
competition of a basketball team playing
the kind of game one reads about.

Perhaps it would be carrying a good thing
too far to say the band had anythingto do
with the results of those games. Credit
for that goes to the cagers as is meet-
and right.

What we do say is that the band created
and maintained spectator spirit of a type

we can always use more of. We hope such,

swing is here to stay. .

The football boys have thelr
shiny new blankets all ready to

One of the slicker cases of two-
tircihg is being performed by Ed
Harvey. while in Pittsburgh dur-
ing the holidays, he met the
blond half of the Fl‘eiser sisters~
Ziegfeld Follies, features—and
took the well known tumble. Now
he is writing uone-and-ohly let-
ters" to both Pittsburgh and
Minneapolis. This is one case of
not wanting both ends to meet.

The pro-Nazi sentiments which
Langan displays in the boys’ ccif-
fures is neither pretty her very
sensational. Hagan introduced
them long ago, but we never ex-
pected them to become a general
campus eye-sore. Vaughn hasn't
even a scalp lock to offer Mary
Beth, who certainly deserves bet
ter than thls.

 

 

Sol’r as Head of

June Institute

Harold Mathews has been ap-
pointed tc succeed Guy w. Solt
as executive secretary of the June
Institute of International Rela—
tions, it was announced today.

Mathews, a Grinnell graduate,
hes been in China for the last 15
years in charge of the executive
branch of the work of the Gong
regationztl church in China.

salt has been executive sccrc
tary of the conference since it:
founding three years die.

The Nelson—Hale romance which
we started off with such hearty
good wishes and In which we had
confidence in this world of flux.
seems to be a little erratic lately.
But we have little doubt that
the truth is great and will pre-

.vail, and that here are two who

will restore all our conﬁdence in
the good old institutions.
a . s
And since romance has come
up, we wish all joy to the Cowles-
Neiman coalescence. We hope that
Evagenc will make her mistake

consistently.

Well, the longruwaited White
house serves its purpose very
well. Sofas. though scanty, are
soft. and it's well heated, much
better than the steps behind the
library most any of theseywinter
nights.
