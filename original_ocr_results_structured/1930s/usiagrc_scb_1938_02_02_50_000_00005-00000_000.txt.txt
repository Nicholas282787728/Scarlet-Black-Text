mention too are the delightfully
acid comedy of the three “Humor-
esques“ and the hearty animal
spirits of “Bitches Dias, sonorita.”

in spite of an unfortunate stage
accident, the “Aida" ballet was
interesting because of the modern
choreography, the novel costum—
ing and the masks which gave
the charm of novelty to the
venerable Verdi chestnut.

The “Iberian Monotone," which
closed the program, had an addedI
sentimental value as a tribute to
the late Maurice Ravel and was
in itself an impressive creation
of mood, although here the need
lfor a larger stage and for'an
orchestral accompaniment with
its richness and power of con-

Comparison with the perform-
ance last year of thc Ted Shawn
group seems inevitable. Perhaps
because of the greater variety of
techniques presented last night,
perhaps because of an ingrained
prejudice that the classical bal-
let is the firm foundation upon
which all dancing, even the most

Poli’rical Science
Frai Members
Plan, Third Pariy

WASHINGTON, FA.7(ACP)7
student members of Pi Sigma
Alpha, honorary political science
fraternity at Washington and
Jefferson college, not satisfied
with present governmental and
political conditions, have laid the
ground work for a third party.

The fraternity has branded Cap»
ital gains and surplus profits tax—
es as discriminatory and not pro—
gressive, and advocates their
abolition.

They also advocate the extens
sion of civil Service “within rea»
son". Compulsory arbitration of
labor disputes is scored ,for its
"fascisti tone," and other “under
sirahle characteristics".

The Roosevelt administration
was especially criticized for its
supreme court activity as the ore
ganizatioit advocated limiting
powers of the legislative bodies
