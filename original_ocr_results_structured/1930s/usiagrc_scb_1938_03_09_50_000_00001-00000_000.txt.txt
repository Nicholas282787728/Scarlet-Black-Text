Forensic Plea
Reiecl’ed

Council Turns Down
Petition Asking for
$17 Debate Fund

The student Council last night
rejected a petition by women's
Forensic, asking that $17 of the
fuhdpreviously set asideforwom-
en’s debate he allowed as prize
money for Women's intramural
debate.

The petition was sent to the
campus governing body by Wilma
Altenbernd, president of Forensic.
According to ,John Spence,
president, the Council is taking
action to turn the money allotted
for women's dchate from the
semester fee fund over to the
White house, since no organiza—
tion of women’s debate has been
active on the campus this year.

The council also recommended
that so be taken from the fund
to purchase two books to be
awarded as prizes in women‘s
intramural debate.

The money, amounting
percent of the total fee, would
be placed in the White house
general fund.

The proposal is made possible,
Spence said, by the decision to
abandon plans for women's de-
bate for the current year, be-
caiise of lack of interest.
