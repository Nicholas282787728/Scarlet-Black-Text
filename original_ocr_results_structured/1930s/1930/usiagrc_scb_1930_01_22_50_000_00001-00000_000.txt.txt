Playing the style of game which
thrills as only 8. man to man defense

tional contest to the St. Louis uni-

Operating on the theory that his
team of ﬁve seniors had gene’smle,
Coach Nyikos started an entirely
different lineup against Grinnell, but,
after ten minutes of play saw Grin-
nell leading, 3 to 2, he sent in his re-
gulars. Corrollgh was the ﬁrst to
count and Minicr made a gift toss
for the third Grinnell paint. Ken-
nedy tipped in a shot for the Billi-
ken's two points.

After ten minutes Grinnell seemed
to be showing an edge and the St,

a ﬁeld goal and a free throw, how-
cvcr, and the half ended with the
count 7 to e.

With the St. Louis regulars stay-
ing in the game, Murray tied up the
count early in the second half by
sinking a free throw. ' DeLong fol-
lowed suit and the Pioneers led, s to

time on, St. Louis taking a 14 to g
load, only to See Murray and Douglas
cut it down to a 16 to 15 count with
seven minutes to go,

The home team was equal to the
occasion, however, and sent the count
to 20 in the ﬁnal minutes While the
best Grinnell could muster was a long
shot by Murray.

The sophomore Grilmell star was
high scorer for the game with six
points. Strong and Lintzenich were
the St. Louis stars While Douglas co-
starred with Murray for the Pione-

' Norman Thomas, leader of the So-
ccialist party, its candidate for tile

trlal Democracy.

Entering politics in 1924, he ran
for governor or New York on the
Socialist ticket. 1n the 1923 pre‘
dential campaign, many of the in-
tellectural group in the country sup-

campaign for mayor in New York.
He received the largest solialisl vote
for mayor in the history of that city.

During the campaign, several
prominent New York papers support-

Holman, Hemphill Report
on Chemistry Research
Monday Night.

Original research work carried on
in the chemistry laboratory during
the past year was reported to the
science club Monday evening by Davc
Holman, Professor Ray and Martha
Hemphill in accounts which, though
interesting. were technical beyond
the understanding of many of their
audience. At the end of the program
carbon dioxide show, too cold to be
painlessly touched, wils made and
distributed among those attending.

Mr. Holman told of his work on
the preparation and composition of
Aplha, beta. gama trl-methyl, alpha,
gamma di-carboxy glutaric acid.
Mr. Holman started his work last
March, 'the object being to separate
out the two carbon dioxide groups
from the compound. Since the acid
is an organic compound, the reac-
tions require a .very long time, and
hence patience of the part of the
investigator. The experiment is not
yet completed; it may lead to the dis-
covery of a now reaction.

Professor Ray gave the theory and
Martha Hemphill the chemistry of
their work on the optically active
diazo compounds last summer; Miss
Hemphill was able to assist in the
research through a grant from the
chdrixscn memorial fund.

Explains Light Vibration

“The aim of the work was to test
the possibility of applying the elec-
tronic theory to the idea of optically
active compounds," Mr. Ray stacd.
He explained that light vibrates
through a crystal of Iceland spar in
only one plane; if a second crystal
is put in line so that the two axes
are not parallcl, the light cannot
pass. The optically active com-
pounds, Mr. Ray,pointed out, are
substances that when placed between
the two crystals twist or rotate the
beam of light,

The two compounds with which
the research is concerned are isom-
crs, composed of the same elements,

Two over-confident Clark hall

teams met defeat in the hands of
Langan hall Saturday afternoon in
the ﬁnal games of the second round
of intramural basketball. The A
team lost 14-11, while the E quintet
went down 19-17, in two over-time
periods. Dibble took both her
games from Smith; the A team win-
ning 11-5. the B team crashing
through to a 23-0 score.

The Langan B-Clark B encounter
proved to be the most thrilling game
of the season, Langan finally pulling
through to win by a single basket in
the sixth minute of over-time play.
The score stood 7-6 at the half in
Clark‘s favor; all six points for
Langan having been netted by Foval.
When the whistle blew ending the
fourth quarter, the score stood tied
at 17-17. A three minute over-time
pcn'orl was played with the result
that neither team was able to score.
A Second extra pcriod allowed Briggs
of Lnngan to slip in his only field
goal of the game which gave the
Langanites the game 19-17. Mc-
Curdy was high score man, account-
ing for nine points.

Dibble Beats Smith

In Lhe A game, Langan playing the
same ﬁve men throughout. came
through to a rather unexpected vic-
tory ovcr Clark 14-11. The game
was close from the beginning but the
consistent passing and ﬂoor work of
Jones and Rent gave Langan the
edge, particularly in the last quart-
er. Thomas played a sterling game
for Clark, being the only man of
their outﬁt that seemed any where
near to form.

Calories! Posture!

Arches! These

Hold Primary Interest for Thirty

Calories! Calories! Posture! Cal-
ories! Good arches! More calories:
These are the things which are of
primary interest to the thirty girls
now enrolled in thc corrcctlvc gym-
nasium classes which meet in the
mornings.

Calories must be counted every
meal and each girl mllst cat the cor-
rect amount of starch, carbohydrate,
and fat calorics. And— wonder of
wonderslithese girls arc not trying
to reduce! They are merely trying
to keep a well balanced diet so that
they will be strong and healthy.

 

Exercises are given for the pur-
pose of 'correctlng poor posture,
weak arches; and many other rc-
medial measures arc given for weak-
nesses curable in such a manner.

All of the thirty girls are vitally
interested and will undoubtcdly be
among those wide~awake, healthy
specimens who have no fear of those
dreaded semester examinations.

The corrective class, under the
direction of Miss Andersen, is doing
cxccllcnt 'Work, and soon good
posture and strong arches should be
in the majority on the campus.

Creighton Next
for Cage Team

Revamped Pioneer Cagers
Face Conference Game

This Evening.

With Paul Edmans. lengthy sopho-
more guard, spending thc day in
scholastic troubles, the Pioneer
squad left Tuesday afternoon for
Omaha where they tangle with
Creighton tonight. minus the serv-
ices of the lanky newcomer. Minier
will probably take his place at the
defense position although the lineup
which Coach Truesdalc used Monday,
with Douglas and Dclong at guards,
Humphrey at ccnter and Ruff and
Scott at forwards, seemed to function
fairly well.

Smarting under the sting of three
defeats in the past week, the Crin-
nell quintet ripped through the trash
five Monday with several baskets,
only to see the yearling stiffen late
in the drill under a tongue lashing
by Coach Watt, and hold them
scoreless for several minutes.

Until this season Grinnell
never defeated Creighton in either
football or basketball. The Pioneers
chalked up a victory on a snow ocv-
ered gridiron Thanksgiving day,
however, and are in Omaha determ-
ined to change the count on the bes-
ketball recnrd book, -

The Bluejays hold three cage vic-
torics ovcr Grinnell, winning in
1926-27. 35 to 31; in 1927-28, 24 to 19
and last season, 39 to 25.

ha arc Murray, Douglas, Scott, Min»

ers, Llewely'n Powysis a poet. A. R.
Powys is an architect and T. F. -
Powys is an artist "John and Llew-
elyzi are listed in Who's Who in Am-

Writing about the Powys brothers
in an article, which is called a family
confession and appeared in the Sep-
