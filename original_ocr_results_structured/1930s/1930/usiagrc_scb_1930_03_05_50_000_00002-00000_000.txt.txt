Then, too, to shut out an educated, highly-intelligent
man of the type of Dr. Macintosh is ccrtainly unjust dis
crimination. The applicant for citizenship papers may
be unscrupulous, of subrnormhl mentality, and dull
morally, and yet pass the tests of citizcnship with little
difficulty; unthinkingly he may mumble the various
oaths of allegiance required as he becomes a citizen.
But let a man of Dr. Maclntosh's caliber apply for citl-
zenship and the courts, dominated by the psychology of
Stephen Decatur and his famous, ”my country, right or
Wrong," declaration, refuse him admittance under the
constitution, even though he believes, as Dr. Macintosh
does, that to promise to bear arms in all cases is con-
trary to Christianity and the will of God.

Dr. Macintosh has been treated unjustly. As the
New York World says “It had always been supposed
until recently that Christianity was compatible with the
American Constitution." We believe that in a country
professing devotion to democracy, freedom of consci-
ence and the Constitution are still compatible. They
must be; if they are not, then the Constitution should
be amended to make them so. The Scarlet and Black
hopes, moreover, that if its readers ever come into con—
tact with cases similar to that of Dr. Macintosh, they
will act as college educated men and women should, to
defend the welfare of the nation by upholdnlg the free-
dom of conscience of its citizens.

Has the time come when liberty of conscience can-
not he reconciled with the Constitution of the United
States? One is led to believe so if the case of Douglas
c. Mchntosh, a professor in the Yale Divinity school,
and other similar cases in the past few years, are
typical.

When Dr. Macintosh applied for citizenship last
June, the application was denied because he delcered:
“I cannot in justice to my obedience to the will of God
consent to bear arms in any or all conﬂicts of this coun-
try." He refused to promise to go to war unless he felt
the war was morally justiﬁed. Abuut a month ago, the
District Court judge issued the formal denial of citizen-
ship, which decreed that because of his refusal to bear
arms, “the petitioner is not attached to the principles
of the constitution of the United states, and hence his
petition for citizenship is denied,"

Those who are interested in making the United
states an enlightened democratic government regret ex-
ceedingly such action on the part of our courts. In the
ﬁrst place, if this nation is to become enlightened, it
must maintain freedom of conscience except where it
clearly violates the moral or relgious sense of the com-
munity. “For," in the words of a bulletin of the Ameri-
can Friends, "to deny the rights of free conscience is
to strike at the very heart of individual character and
to undermine the foundations of democratic institu-
tions." And today, it can hardly be said that a con-
scientious refusal to bear arms violates the moral or Tar
ligious standards of our country, when an increasing
number of people believe that war and Christianity can-
not be reconciled and when the Kellogg Pact has been
adopted by all the leading nations of the world. Rather,
the citizen who is not afraid to work openly, frankly,
to abolish war, is many times more valuable than the
traditional type of citizen who rushes to support the
ﬂag whether the war he just or not. Which type will
hear more fruit in the years to come in advancing the
welfare or his country? The answer, of course, lies in
whether one believes in a future dependent on military
forces or on international good-will. The Scarlet and

NON DEECISION DEBATES.

Debating has taken its place with baseball, track.
and swimming as one of the intercollegiate activities
which fail to attract large crowds, or stimulate wide
student interests, but which are continued, to give small
minorities of interested participants and spectators an
outlet for their energy. »

The situation of debating on the Grinnell campus
does not differ from the condition existing in most of
the other colleges and universities. The problem or
stimulating student interest is a difficult one. It was
thought, that the partial substitution at the student ex-
change for debating, started two years ago, might re- thing she’ll lik 0

terest which even debating, discouraging as its situation _
seemed to be, was capable of stimulating. Moth ",5 Day_May n

it might seem, however, that the restoration of
decision debates might improve the situation to some
extent. There is always an added interest in anything,
characterized by condict, which is capped by the victory
of one side and the defeat of the other. ~ A decision
seems to give point to the whole contest. We imagine
that even a footbau game, were there no system of
scoring and of determing the winner at the end of the
game, would cease.to have the attraction it now has
for spectators.

gmith Hall Retains
Lead in Dorm Polo

Smith hall beat the Kelly stables
water polo team Monday night 11_ to
8, and downed Building Four Tuesday
afternoon 30 to o to hold the league
lead with four straight wins this sea-
son.

The game with Kelly was a hard
fought battle and at one time it came
mighty close to being a win for Build-
ing Three. In the first half Danforth
scored a touch-goal for Smith while
Kelly was only able to make one
free throw, 1n the second half Kelly
made seven points to take an eight
to six lead. It looked bad for the
Smithites until Adams made a goal
late in the last half, which put
Smith back in the lead. Dantorth,
Adams, Norton, and Taylor did most
of the offensive work for Smith,
while Lambie, Kisser, Grounds, and

ences.

Holloway, and Scott held the Build-
ing Three boys by fine defensive
work. Parish, Hayes, Klemme,
Kleaveland, McCay, and Grates
were the offensive combination for
Kelly. McCay, Arnold, Allison, Con-
nor, and Lucke stood off Smith's at—
tacks.

In smith's second game they scor-
ed almost at will. The Building Four
team was powerless to stop them and
had no change to score. E. Denforth,
Scott, Norton and Grounds scored
while Risser and Holloway also saw
plenty of action on the offense. Tay-
lor, Adams and Lambie did what lito
tle protecting of their own goal needs
ed.

Clark hall took Kelly Stables in the
second game Tuesday, 17 to 2. Clark
scored fiften points in the first half
while three got their only points of
the game on free throws. The sees
and half was hotly contested and
Clark was only able to make two
