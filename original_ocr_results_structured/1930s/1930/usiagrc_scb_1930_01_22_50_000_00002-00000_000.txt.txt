TWOJ'IOUII EXAMS.

This is the time of year when students pour forth
countless suggestions for changes in he methods of giv-
ing ﬁnal examinations. One of: th imost commonly
heard criticisms is that, in faced! a college rule to the
effect that the examinations shall 'hc.d“igned torlast
two hours, most professors purposely‘El aw up their quESr
tions on the basis of a three hour examination.

As we understand the purpose of the present stated
policy on the part of the college, the ‘extra hour is to
allow slower students to complete their work, rather then
as an hour to be crammed with extra“questions. When
the latter method is followed, not only those who do
swifter work, but the ones who proceed more slowly he-
come extremely fatigued at the end of three hours;
when they have two such examinations in one day the
strain becomes a question of healt ,

A better grade of work willhe done in the exams
about to commence, and a better spirit maintained be-
tween professor and student if examinations are given
with the intent to follow the spirit of the two»hour col—
lege policy now in effect.

._E. I). A.
CHANGE IN EXAM SCHEDULE.

The present examination Schedule provides for a
Friday morning examination in the course which meets
until threc thirty the afternoon.before. That class
meeting usually demands as much preparation as any
other and the student must review the entire course be-
tween threc thirty and eight twenty the next morning.

One constantly hears students telling of their
exam schedules which include two on Friday, one on
Saturday and two on Monday and hears thcm ask in he.
wilderment, “When to study?”

Of course there are two possible answers: review
through the preceding week. or_ have your material so
well in handthat review is scarcely necessary; Nice
ideas but we doubt their practicability. The week pre-
ceding examinations finds the student with as much
required preparation, as much laboratory, and as many
classes as any other. And this is not the Utopian
dream of a college where review is unnecessary. Rather
it needs to be (we write for the masses) intensive and
complete. _ ’

The impossibility of accomplishing, under the pres
ent system, any review which will give the student an
adequate and lasting resume of his subject seems to us
obvious. We should like to see the examination period
shifted to permit the student the necessary time for re-
‘vicw.

The success of the reading period in the institutions
where it has been tried leads us to recommend it for
consideration. We believe however that the Grinncll
schedule could be changed and still, carried out in the
allotted week. Examinations might begin on Monday
and last through out the week. This would necessitate
rearranging only the one examination which under the
,present system is scheduled for the final Friday. Such
a change would give the student three days rather than
a little more than three hours between his last class
and his first exam. Such a change, we are confident,

’would from all- angles be successful.

LIMITING OUTSIDE ACTIVITIES.

The Inquiring Reporter column running in a recent
issue of the SCARLET AND BLACK showed that on
the question, should student participation in outside
activitics be limited, undergraduate opinion was fairly
evenly divided.

We believe that such limitation imposed upon stu—
dents would he unsatisfactory. It would not be possible
to frame a rule which could fairly apply to eight hun-
dred students of different temperaments and varied
capacities for work. The individual, having had the

'ty to study himself at close range for his
whole ll e, ought certainly be a better judge of his own
capacity than a generalized groupsrule which cannot
take into account the pcculiarities of the individuals
comprising that group, i

A second objection to the proposed mcasurc would
be that complications would arise which would be diffi-
cult of solution. If, for instance, a student was primar-
ily interested in making the Glee club but at the same
time had some interest in the Varsity debating squad,
assuming that his outside activity quota had so mount-
ed up that only one more activity was allowed him, and
assuming further that the Varsity debate tryouts came
before the Glee club tryouts, should that student pass
up the opportunity to make the dchate squad in the
hope (possibly to be frustrated) of making the Glee
club? Or if a student had the chance to hecomc Pres—
ident of Forensic but would prefer presidency of Lao-
tern. clcction to which came later should he withdraw
his Forensic candidacy and take the chance of the
Lantern election going his way? ’

Another objection to the measure would be that it
is needless. The purpose of such a rule would be to
keep students up to par in their grades by preventing
outside activities distracting them from studies. But
as one student in Campus Opinion pointed out this is
automatically taken care of by a rule already in force
providing for the discontinuance of outside activities by
all students receiving a “condition" in any of their
subjects. " , . t,

Lastly an objection could he made to the proposed
plan in its assumption that college courses were in all
cases more important to the student than his outside
activities, an assumption not always true. A man my
tending to become an actor could certainly get more
that would be useful in his profession by participating
in plays (which are outside activities) than he could
out of many of his courses. A man interested in jour-
nalism could certainly pick up more practical. useahle
knowledge by dabbling around with type down at the
Herald office in the interests of one of the campus pub-
lications than he could by attending most of his classes,

In conclusion, we might say that the proposed
measure is based upon a very fantastic hypothesis.
namely that college men in attempting to secure good
grades and participate in numerous activities at the
same time are in danger of straining themselves. We
have heard of college men dying of an alcoholic heart,
we have heard of college men smoking themselves to
dath, but never in our brief and limited experience have

we ever heard of a college man who died of overwork.

THIS MATTER OF EXAMS.

About this time every year numerous champions
of systems of education which do not inciudc exams as
a necessary part of the curriculum arise on the campus.
often, fingers are enviously pointed. directing the at»
tention of the ,“hoi ploi" to the European university
system in which the student population is not fixed but
itinerant, in which exams are occasional and the date
of their occurrence set more or less in accordance with
the desire of the student. _

It is quite true that, in Germany particularly. the
student population of the universities is quite free to
move from university to university at will and takes
advantage of this opportunity to a great extent. It is
true that attendance at lectures is not compulsory, and
examinations may be had at any one of certain periods
that the student to be examined chooses. The Ameri-
can university undergraduate forgets, however, in wish-
ing for these conditions to prevail in the United States,
that the German universities correspond to our gradw
ate schools. In our graduate schools we do have prac-
tically the same privileges as those enjoyed by the Slur
dents in the German universities.

The natural query after the statement, “German
universities correspond in the educational system to
American graduate schools". is “How 50? Don't they
have the institution we call a liberal arts college?"

M'ost assuredly they do have institutions cor-
responding to our liberal arts colleges which are called
“hochschule” or high schools, These “hachschule” cor
respond closely in curriculum to the ﬁrst two years in
particular of the training at such a college ai- Grinnell.
Tllé German ”gymnasium” takes the place of the ﬁrst
twelve grades of our public school system. to all prao
tical purposes. ‘

Thus it is that German university students Seem to
have more privileges than the ordinary American under-
graduate student, and rightly so. for they are really
equivalent in academic accomplishment and experience
to American graduate students and enjoy about the

same rights, liberties, and duties.

OFFICIAL NOTICE.

There is a college regulation imr
posing a fine of 510 for a violation or
library rules. The Library committee
in order to protect the students as
I whole, has found itself compelled
to impose ten dollar fines on four—
teen students. Thc committee hopes
such action will not be necessary in
the future.
