Fine Performers.

The dope sheet ran true to form
when the Class of 1931 annexed the
inter-class track championship for
the third time in succession in the
Home Meet last Saturday. The
juniors gamered a total of as points,
while , the freshmen, by virtue of
their unexpected strength in the
track events, nosed out the sopho-
mores sin/[36% to take Second place
the meet. The seniors trailed with
24 points.
were greatly handicapped due to the
small number of men they entered.

Benny Douglas, star junior, and
Henry Thomas of the sophomores
tied for high-point honors when they
gathered n 14 points apiece.
Thomas failed to give Pojmao, stel-
lar prep performer, much competi-
tion in the dashes but came back in
ﬁne style to take ﬁrst places in both
the javelin and broad jump. Harold
Alexander, freshman, made a .ﬁne
showing when he realized a ﬁrst in
the hundred y‘ard dash, a second in
the broad jump, and ran on the Win»
ning relay team.‘

lucllrath Beats Brother

The mile run saw Howard Mc-
Ilrath triumph .pver his brother~
Arthur, star member of the Grinnell
High School track team, after an ace
citing race. Arthur Mcllrath led
his brother most of the distance but
the Missouri valley champion found
his stride on the home stretch and
literally burned up the track with
his ﬁnal spurt which brought him in
a good twenty yards ahead of
"young" Mcl'lrath. Myron Pilhrow,
freshman distance hope, ran a good
race, leading the Mcllraths most the
race but lacked the reserve power to
ﬁnish out in front.

A real exhibition of grit and en-
durance was shown in the two-mile
run when Pye forced Secor, cross-
country veteran to extend himself to
the limit to win the event in the good
time of 10:24.3. Secor held the lead
throughout but Pye never trailed by
more than ﬁve yards. Both men un-
corked a remarkable sprint for the
last three hundred yards.

Murphy Wins Half

Murphy had everything his own
way in the half mile capturing the
race in 2:022. Hugh Edwards and
Newsom ﬁnished second and third.
Hensley took both hurdle events with
no difficulty but placed second to
Greene in the pole vault, Captain

‘College Man to Be Hired for Prospect
of Future Development, ’ Says Dreese

BY FLORENCE LEWiS.

“The college man who gets a job
this spring may be certain that he is
being hired not for his immediate
services but for the prospect of his
further development,” stated Mit~
chcll Dreese, director of personnl
when questioned concerning his v rt
to Chicago during spring vacation.
On this trip, when he was accom-
panicd by eight Grinnell men and
two Grinnell Women, Mr. Dreese dis-
covered that employment conditions
are not at their usual status.

“The president of the American
Federation of Labor recently an-
nounced that there are over 3,700,000
unemploycd in the United States at
the present moment," declared Mr.
Dreese," and after I had called on
about twenty large industrial con-
cerns in Chicago, I realized the sig-
nificance of the statement. Firms
which ordinarily take on fifty col-

 

lege men are now taking on from
ten to twenty. However. larger
firms realize that they are going to
need executives in three, four, or
five years and are, thcrcfore. re-
cruiting men.”

While in Chicago Mr. Dreese made
contacts with twenty concerns most
of which have not employed Grinncll
men in the‘past. Each one of thc
Grinnell seniors who went with him
had from six to twelve interviews.
Some were immediately given offers.

it was evident to Mr. Dreese that
Grinnell men are bcld in great es-
tccm by most Chicago employers.
Some remarked to him that they
preferred thc man from the small
college to the graduate from the
large university. Several of these
Same employers are planning to
come to Grlnell next year to inter-
view prospective employees.

Net Team to Go to
Ames on Saturday

Rainy weather will make it neces-
sary for the Grinnell college tennis
team to open its regular season
against Iowa. State at Ames Satur-
day almost without practice, except
for that which Jones and Kent ob-
tained during the spring vacation
trip to thc sonthland. In addition
to this, the team will be playing for
the first time in three years without
the services of Coggeshall, former
Grinnell star.

Tho concrete courts at Ames have
made it possible for the Cyclone net-
sters to get in some workouts early
in- the season and they therefore
claim the advantage on the dope
sheet. _

Captain Jones will be, at the num-
ber one berth this year and Kent in
the second place. others making the
trip to Ames will be Bobby DeLong,
another veteran, his brother Chuck
De Long and Ed Allen. The personr
nel of the five-man team may- be
changed later in the season when the
squad gets out for regular practice
sessions, however.
