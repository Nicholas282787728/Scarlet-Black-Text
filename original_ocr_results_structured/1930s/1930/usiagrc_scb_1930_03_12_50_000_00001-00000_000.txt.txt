“I'm off for Paris to make
whoopee," announced Walter Scott.
better known as “Death Valley Scot-
ty” recently.

Out on a barren desert lot in Cali-
fornia, Death Valley Scotty is build—
ing a four million dollar "desert
shack". “And when my house is
done. I won't have to go to Paris to
make whoopee,” said Scotty, who
asks nothing of the world but a good
time. "It has chimes, a glass bot-
tom swimming tank, lots of fancy
trimmings, and a plant where
I can talk to .the world.
I'm socking a half million bucks into
this hooey plant just to whoop up
things for the old west.”

It was in 1905 that Death Valley
Scotty ﬁrst became famous by
chartering a train which took him
from Los Angeles to Chicago in the
record breaking time of fortyefour
hours.

Dibble Beats Five
in Water Polo, 10-7

The dice just weren’t rolling for
the Clark hall water polo experts
yesterday,‘ and after they rolled a
seven in the ﬁrst half, they failed
completely in their efforts to hit 11
in the second. Dibble hall trounced
the Building Five boys 10 to 7 to
take the seccnd place honors of the
intramural loop out of their hands.

The Clark men counted seven dur-
ing the ﬁrst period but at the start
of the second half Dibble scored a
pair of touch goals to put the game
on ice. Clark did not threaten dur—
ing the entire second half, for the
Dibble offense proved strong enough
to demand the efforts of all of the
Five men on the defense.

Miller, Ewald and DeWindt were
the Dibble defense stars while Helde
ridge, Rinefort and Graflund were
the attacking experts. Roth, Walk-
er and Murray defended the Clark
goal with Klinefelter, Gaheline and
Ross doing the scoring.

The Writers’ club will hold a meet-
ing in the South Parlors tonight at
7:15 p. m. Manuscripts will be read
and criticised.

Four to Be Gates Hall,
Afler Former President

At a house meeting held last night
in Building Four, it was decided to
name the hall after George E. Gates,
former president of the college. The
namc is being presented to President
Main who in turn will present it to
the Board of Trustees for ﬁnal ap»
proval, Dedication of the building
will probably take place at com~
mencemcnt time, President Main said
yesterday.

Building Four has been on the
outlook for a name for some time,
and the collcgc officials were finally
consulted. The other men’s dorm!»
tories have been named after men
who have endowed the college with
large sums of money, and it was at
ﬁrst thought that the hall would be
named after some similar person, but
the name of the fen-ner president
was suggested and voted upon.

 

GRINNELL. IOWA, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 12, 1930.

Peck Recalls Flying Trip of Glee Club
With‘Death ValleyScotty ’ s’ Trainmen

Two years later, the Grinnell col-
lege Men's Glee club left Grinnell on
their annual tour. They started in
a special car. the “Elsie" on the Iowa
Central line (now termed the honor-
able M. & St. L.) During the tour,
they had an engagement at Denver.
But rains and washouts had made
the "Elsie" too late for them to keep
their engagement.

At McCook. Nebraska, three hun-
dred and ﬁfty miles from Denver,
they chartered a special train to
take them on. The train and
the crew were the same as had taken
Death Valley Scotty on his record
breaking transcontinental trip.

Train Hits Cow.

“The train bumped as though it
were riding sixty foot waves," said
Prof. David Peck, who was a stu-
dent member of the Glee club on
that tour. “We made the trip six
hours faster then the fastest mail
train. The average speed was 72
miles an hour and we went as fast
as 98. An extra car was put on to
hold the train down. The only ac-
cldent occurred when we hit a cow
and splashed it all over the cow—
catcher!"

An old edition of the Scarlet and
Black described the trip saying, 'the
train went so fast that the condl‘ct-
or lost his hat, and a boy his
glasses."

The train pulled into Denver at
7:30, just in time for the memli rs
to dress and give the concertiaﬂ er

All-Dorm Polo

Teams Chosen

Dibble and Smith Halls Eacll
Get Two Men Placed on
First Team.

All Dorm Teams.

First Team Second Team
Gabeline, 5 Scott,
Itinefort, 6 Grounds,
Adams, 1 DeWindt,
Grates, 3 Bradford,
Graflund, a Pojman,
Taylor, 1 G Roth,
Smith hall and Dibble hall, ﬁrst

and second teams in the intramural
water polo loop, picked off four of
the places on Coach Carroll Swear-
ingen's all dorm team while Three
and Clark shared the other two,

The choice of Gabeline as forward
can be contested by no one. The
ﬁghting Clark man played all over
the pool, and, although he was some-
times handicapped by his lack of
size, he usually managed to be on top
when the ducking was done. Rine—
fort was the Dibble scoring threat,
although his defensive work was not
on a par with that which Gabeline
demonstrated in every game of the
season.

Adams, slim Smith yearling, was
a tireless swimmer in every game
and was always ﬁrst to get to the
ball. He rovcd from one end of the
pool to the other and all in all show-
ed himself an ideal center.

Chooses Grates

The guards on the team are
scarcely matched with little Grates
of Three and Graflund of Dibble
holding the places. Grates fought
his way to the top every time. how-
ever, despite the fact that he played
with a losing team and he never fail-
ed to pick his man regardless of size
of ab ity. Graflund was a sturdy,
stolid block for any forward to com-
pete with in every game and was one
of the reasons that Smith hall failed
to score a touch goal against the
Dibble men.

“Shep” Taylor, faithful guardian
of the Smith board, proved capable
enough to win a berth on the my—
thical sextet. He was a ruthless
man to meet in the water, and al-
though he scldom left his post, he
made it tough for the man who
caused him to move on certain oc-

Drake Doped to Win Annual
Event at Des Moines
‘ Next Saturday.

The Grinnell college swimming
team will go to Drake next Satur-
day to compete in the Missouri
Valley swimming meet. Drake was
the winner last year and has good
chances of repeating this year, ale
though Washington will probably
place second. They will make Drake
work hard for her victory. Grinnell
is favor-ed to win third place, while
Creighton and the Oklahoma Aggies
will bring up the rear. Both Drake
and Washington have strong teams
this year.

Squires of Drake will probably win
the breast stroke, while DeLong of
Grinnell and Brenner of Washington
will battle for second place. AC-
cording to Coach Carroll Swearen-
gen. Grinnell will probably place
two men in the 440 yard swim, with
Washington winning the event. In
the relay Washington has a slight
edge over Drake, and Grinnell is ex—
pected to come in third. The med-
ley relay will probably go to Drake
with Washington a close second
and Grinnell following. Both the
100 yard and the 40 yard free style
swims are expected to be a ﬁght be-
tween Drake, Washington, and Grin-
nell.

DeLung should place in the
fancy diving although he will be up
against two good divers, Nauart of
Drake and Strong of Washington.
Nauart is one of the best divers in
the Missouri Valley and is almost
certain of ﬁrst place. Both Creigh-
tons and Oklahoma's teams are
weak, and neither is expected to

place in more than two or three
events.

Junior Girls’ Cage
Team Beats F rosh

The seniors will battle the sopho—
mores in the next to the last game
of the Women's Basketball touma-
ment, Thursday afternoon at 3:30 in
Rand gymnasium. The seniors
have played two games and won one
of them, the Juniors have played two
and won them both. the sophs have
won one, and the freshmen have lost
three so far in the tourney.

The juniors downed the freshmen
with a so to 17 victory in the
seventh game of the Women's basket-
ball tournament played Tuesday af-
ternoon. Both teams fought hard,
but the preps were unable to keep
up when the juniors let loose and
started scoring.

Both teams put up strong defenses
during the ﬁrst half, the freshman
sextet keeping the lead until the last
few minutes, when the juniors pep-
ped up, tying the score at eight all.
In the third quarter the juniors pil-
ed up a score of twenty, while the
preps added only one ﬁeld goal to
their score. The last quarter was
featured by a whirlwind comeback
on the part of the preps.

Jensen and Sherman did cxcellcnt
guarding for the freshmen, making
the junior forwards put up a hard
ﬁght. DeLong and Johnson at for
ward positions did fast work also.
Coggeshall, junior forward, led the
scoring with thirteen ﬁeld goals to
her credit.

Miss Gretchen Steiner, associate
in public relations of Grinnell col-
lege. spoke to the students of Bur-
lington junior college in an assembly
of the school today.

Second Spanish
Banquet is Held
in Quad Tuesday

At a dinner party in the quad-
rangle dining room Tuesday eve-
ning, twelve students of the college
Spanish classes, with the aid of no.
scriptive gesturesgmanaged to ask
for “moyonesa” and upotatas dora-
das" without using a word of their
native language. Cards inscribed in—
scribed in Spanish with the place
and date and the menu assured that
no one need drink his coffee without
cream simply because his vocabu-
lary did not happen to include the
Spanish word “leche.”

After dinner, Miss Curtis. the
Spanish instructor, and the students
met in the parlor of Cottage IV. Mary
Lou Fyfe. wearing the skirt, waist,
and shawl of a Spanish peasant girl,
and Wyman Gerhardt, representing
a priest, carried on a dialogue in
Spanish, "Quien Supicra Escribir!”
—“If I Only Knew How To
Write." The dialogue, in which the
peasant girl asks the priest to write
a love letter for her, was written by
Campoamor. a nineteenth century
romantic poet.

After the recitation of the dia-
logue, the students sang the Spanish
song “Serenata de Fierrot"—"Sere-
made of Pierrot."

Physical Education
Major to Be Given

Beginning next September it will
be possible for women to major in
Physical Education, Miss Anderson,
head of the department, announced
yesterday.

“There has been a growing de-
mand for physical training and
teaching courses in the subject and
consequently the department has
been enlarged to enable girls to
major in Physical Education.” she
said. ”There are several Grinnell
graduates who are successfully
teaching on a minor. but it is much
easier with a major.”

Courses which are necessary to
secure a major in this department
include: Biology, Physiology, History
of Physical Education, Kinesiology.
Playground Management, Coaching
of Minor and Major sports, Correc-
tive Work, Pageantry. Theory of
Danish Gymnasics, Practice Teach-
ing, Program Making, Personal Hy—
giene and First Aid.

Raymond Peter-son, ’32, acted as
l‘et'ereeYat the sectional cage tourney
in Des Moines last Friday and Satur-
day.

 

Students Discover Playing Wall Street
lsn’ t Always Money Making Proposition

“Great guns!
day!"

"Well, I made nearly. $175."

To most people this sounds like
Wall Street chatter, and to hear
such expressions from a Grinnell col-
lege dormitory would almost cons
vince one that this was a school for
prospective millionaires who are get-
ting their Wall street practice early.

“Where's the ﬁnancial section of
the paper’” “Didn't know there was
such a. section," comes back the an
swer. “What? Eastman Kodak up
to 226? And to think that I sold
mine last Week for 201!"

“I’m wiped out! U. S. Steel hos
dropped 60 points. I’m bankrupt,"
comes from another as he looks up
from the ﬁnancial sheet and into his

I lost $300 yester—

note book,

But, queer as it all may seem,
these students shed no tears as they
declare their heavy losses. Their
losses aren’t actual losses, and they
are NOT millionaires. They are just
plain college students, and the losses
are only paper losses, for the invest
ment case involved is only a hypothr
etical one, and the “gamblers" are
just the members of the Investments
class.

Each student has invested a bye
potnetical 320.000 and is trying to
see how much he can make (or lose)
by the time school is out. So rc-
member next time the room-mate
says he’s lost 5200 that he isn't out
that much, actually. but that he may
be some day if he doesn't change his
avocnticn.

Track Artists
Will Compete

at Illinois Next

Douglas Will Enter Special
Event for Versatile
Athletes.

Three Others to Go

McIlmth, Mile Relay Team Tum in
Best Time of Season at Notre
Dame Last Saturday.

Ben Douglas, Grinnell college's all
around track performer, will get a
chance to compete in his own field
at the Illinois meet at Urbana Sat-
urday when he enters the special
event for versatile athletes. If he
places in the event it will be due to
his all around ability rather than
any stellar work in any one depart-
ment of track and ﬁeld work, for he
should be able to turn in a fair aver-
age in every event.

The Pioneer star has had only two
weeks of track training, since _he
stayed with the basketball team until
the season closed, but he already does
the half mile in better than 2:20 and
this will be his weakest event. He
puts the shot 35 feet and has broad
jumped better than 21 feet. 20 feet,
7 inches is his best mark this spring,
but ' he can get out a few inches
farther if called upon. He high
jumps around 6 feet when in shape
and goes over the bar at 11 feet in
the pole vault. He has never been
timed in the 75 yard dash but turns
in a :05 3-10 mark in the 50 yard
event and :07 2-10 in the 50 yard
hurdles.

nllnols Relays Next.

He has been a powerful cog in the
Grinnell track team in the past.
Showing» up particularly well at
Creighton last spring when he took
second in the shot, second in the
high jump, second in the javelin,
third in the broad jump and tied for
ﬁrst in the pole vault.

Coach G, L. Duke will not take his
mile relay team to the Illinois meet
but will probably be Satisﬁed with
Hank Thomas. Douglas and Mc-
Ilrath, with Murphy standing a
chance of going as an entry in the
1000 yard event.

McIlrath should show up for a
place in the 1,500 meter event this
week, since it is slightly shorter than
a mile, and he is a good half miler
as well as a miler. In running at
Notre Dame, he forced a pair of
Olympic men to the tape in 4:33 and
ﬁnished less than a yard from the
leader.

Thomas will compete in the 300
yard event Saturday, an event which
should just ﬁt his speed. The sopho-
more has the speed of a sprinter. be-
ing a fair man in the 50 yard dash,
and the endurance of a quarter-mil-
er. two qualities which make him
look like a place at 300 yards.

Score Fonr Points.

The Central Intercollegiate meet
at Notre Dame last Saturday went
to Notre Dame with 38 1»2 points
while Drake placed third with 14 273
points. Grinnell, the only ‘other
Iowa team entered, scored four
points, the men going through their
paces in some fast time but getting
some stiffer competition than they
had expected.

Mcllrath pulled in two of Grin-
nell's four points when he ﬁnished
third in the mile run, beating out
Quigley of Notre Dame. Walter of
Marquette, Canadian Olympic man.
took ﬁrst place. The mile relay
team took Gl'innell's other third
place with Mark, H. Edwards.
Thomas and Pelletier running. Notre
Dame ﬁnished ﬁrst to set a new
meet record of . 9 3-10. The Pio-
neers ran the race in the best indoor
