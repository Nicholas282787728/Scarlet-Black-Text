Editor
The Scar-let and Black
Grinnell, Iowa
Dear Sir:

It's the morning after the Grinncll
game at Detroit. The Scarlet and
Black was beaten, out not out-
ganied. Time after time the large
crowd gave the Grinnell team most
generous rounds of applause for has
determined stands it made against
great odds. our boys were badly out—
weighed, itnd on straight football,
could make few gains.

Newspaper accounts do not give
Grinneli credit, however, for the
mighty ﬁne passing attack it showed.
The Detroit team seemed unable to
stop it, and time litter time our team
went down the held for long gains.

1n the ﬁnal moment of play a pass
of 40 yards put Grinnell on the two
yard line, and I doubt not that we
could have scored on me next play,
The passing game or our team was
mighty ﬁne, I believe the hoys should
have used it even more than they did.

Grinnell came into these new parts
and showed the true Grinnell spirit.
Before the game was over hundreds
in the east stands were shouting for
a Grinnell touchdown or two. A little
crowd of fellows in the north stand

‘ got together and did some mighty
good rooting for our team. One of the
things that pleased our alumni was
the ﬁne, generous, courteous attitude
which the crowd showed toward the
team.

In Ruff, Thomas, Hensley, and
Douglas we have tour mighty ﬁne
men, and they showed themselves to
be real players last night: The Ruff-
Thomas passing combination showed
the Detroit fans something. We really
lost two touchdowns hy the closest
of margins.

I enclose a couple of clippings from
Detroit papers, Thank you for the
copies of The Scarlet and Black. I
passed them on to alumni at the
game.

cordially,
Frank 0. Ellis, ’14
Detroit, Mich.

Kansas—The largest ﬂock of fresh-
men in years turned out for fresh-
man football at the University of
Kansas this year when Freshman
Coach Steve Hinshaw issued his call.
Suits were checked out to 128 and
all are now being drilled in the film
damentals of the game.

Thrills Found

by Professors

Dr. Steiner Explains Why
College Instructors
Enjoy Work

Why is a college protessor a col-
lege professor?

Not, according to Dr. Edward A.
Steiner, professor of applied Christ-
ianity at Grillnell college, hccause of
the large salaries, which are nous
existant.

“Nor is it because of_ the chance of
fame,” he added, "for, in reality
there are just about two ways and
two ways only for him to get his
name in the headlines. One is to say
something foolish; the other to say
something so wise that the people
around him think it is foolish.
There's Thrill in It
“A college professor is a college
professor because of the thrills he
gets out of it."
Dr. Steiner was endeavoring 'to
give the new students some idea of
what their professions are and why
they are, and in explaining as thrills
the things that draw some men into
the teaching profession, he said;

‘Wlmt wits—What Willne'

“Our ﬁrst thrill we get by keeping

‘om- opportunity to watch and study
‘nnd live with that over recur ug
‘Ilow of yoimg liic. Then we are thr —
led as we keep in touch with the mo, .
tcrs of men through the ages, in
studying them and their thoughts
‘and plans,

l “Likewise we got a great thrill out
of studying and understanding the
«creations of man, and ﬁnally we get
‘our greatest thrill out oi standing
‘belwccn what was and what will he,
,nnd we are not all the ahscnt minded
‘proicssor of caricature."
