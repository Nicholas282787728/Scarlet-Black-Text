New at Creighton

By FRANK PELLEGRDI
(Spefﬁal to The Scarlet and Black)

OMAHA 7 Creighton university’s
five men cross-country will under-
take a heroic task, when it partici-
pates in the Missouri‘Valley confer-
ence meet to be held at Grinneil Nov.

the Bluejay barriers.

Cross-country running is an em
tirely new sport at Creighton, and
members of the Jay team are pio-
neering in their field, he stated.
However, without the benefit of vet-
eran material, Coach Graf has been
sending his charges through stiff
workouts since Sept. 20, and express-
ed himself Tuesday as “not only
pleased. but surprised at the results."

Two Good Bets

Members of the team will include
Capt. Emil Kubat, James McGreevey,
Hugh Schwaa'o, Charles Kirchner.
and Ray McGuire. Graf’s best bets
for point-winners in the meet are
Kubat and McGuire‘accordmg to
Creighton sport fans.

This team will also run in the Mid-
west A. A. U. meet, to be held at
Kearney, Nell, on Thanksgiving day.

With part of their number dressed
as cave women and others as tin
soldiers, the women of the quad-

dinner party Monday evening. Many
of the costumes were impromptu
rigs concocted at the last moment,
but it was a gala and colorful affair
and everyone seemed to be having a
hilarious time.

Probably the house mothers caused
the most mirth. Dressed in the styles
of the particular periods that they

Brundidge Talk Features

The feature of the 1930 convention
is the address to be given at 2:30 Fri-
day nfternoon in Herrick chapel by
Harry T. Brundidge of the St. Louis
Star. The topic of his talk will be
"Adventures in Newspaper Report-
Log."

Brundidge received notoriety last
summer for his writings in connec-
tion with the murder of Alfred “Jake"
'Lingle, Chicago Tribune crime repor-
ter. He was assigned by the star to
write a series of copyrighted stories
on crime in Chicago. He charged in
the articles that other Chicago news-
paper men besides Lingle were graf-
ters. The stories in connection with
the disclosure were also syndicated.

Testified Before Grand Jury

The Chicago Tribune reprinted the
articles from the St. Louis Star, and
they were the center of a. storm of
criticism by the Chicago press. Brun-
didge was called before the grand
jury in Chicago to testify about the
supposed newspaper ”racketeering,”
which he discussed in his stories.

An interview with Al Capone, Chi-
cago gangster, which Brundidge ob-
tained at Miami Beach, Fla, was a1<
so copyrighted by the Star and re-
printed by the Chicago Tribune. Ca-
pone denied the interview after its
publication. He told Brundidge it was
no use to attack Chicago graft, and
that everyone would make a monkey
out of him. "You're right; because
you’re right, you're wrong," Brun-
didge quoted Capone as saying.

The convention will start with reg-
istration at 3 o'clock Friday morning
