GRINNELI. AND DRAKE.
Grinnell and other colleges of Iowa are in Des

Moines today as the guests of Drake university at an-
other one of its nationally famous relay carnivals.
Founded in 1909, the Drake relays have grown under
efficient management until the staging of the 1930 re-
lays is the most outstanding national track event to he

held this spring.

Grinnell participated in state track meets at Drake
in 1905, but it was not until 1920 that the Pioneers ﬁrst
sent three teams to compete in the relays. since then
teams coached by “Doc" Huff, now of the University of
Missouri, "Les” Duke and others have worn the Maltese
cross of Grinnell at Drake. Morgan Taylor probably
was the Grinnellian thiit participated in a Drake relays
with the greatest success.

Grinnell and Drake engage in traditional rivalry
every year on the football ﬁeld. basketball court, cinder
track and tennis court. Grinnell and Drake have re-
mained sincere friends through the hotest of contests.

From Grimlell, a friendly rival, congratulations are
given to Drake today upon its greatest of relays. Year
by year the show becomes more popular—rain or shine
number of participants increases,

THE PROFESSIONAL RACKET.
It will be remarkable if the twenty-ﬁve hundred

athletes who gather at Drake this week-end get away
without someone's being accused of professionalism,
And if anyone is being helped through school by a
scholarship, or has taught someone how to swim while
hired .as a lifeguard, or has dropped too many helpful
hints to players while rolling tennis courts last summer.
he will probably be barred from competition.

it is obvious in these cases that the rule barring
anyone for ever having got proﬁt from his athletic
ability may have done very well in old England to separ-
ate the wage-earning proletarian from independent
gentlemen, but that does not ﬁt college students who
have to earn their way. If a man is a good swimmer,
it is hard to see why he shouldn't teach others to swim
as his summer job.

The important distinction to he made in a college
is between students who come for education and those
who come for some other purpose. And since a lot of
men in the latter class are neither poor nor athletes, the
athletic rule is of very little use to colleges.

A strict grade rule to expel mcolwho are not doing
college work \v'ould get rid of professional athletes who
are not students, and would not keep men of athletic
ability from making their summer money in the way

most adapted to their talents.

Bracey each won their qualifying
heat in :09 8-10 while Told!) took sec-
ond in a 10 ﬂat heat after getting
away to a bad start.

While these three men take sprint
honors, the Illinois university outﬁt
look like the class in sprint relay
competition. In the «MO-yard relay
Friday Illinois leL out in the ﬁrst
heat when the baton was knacked to
the ground as the third and fourth
men juggled it. Dceming it accidental,
Referee Frank Hill allowed Illinois
to run the second heat. and, although
the men had just finished running the
race once. they copped the second
heat in :41 8-10 to tie the meet rel:-
ord. The men cracked another first
in the second heat of the SsO-yard
relay preliminaries in 1:27 3-10, bets
tcring the Drake record set by
Illinois in 1523 by 2-10 seconds.
IMichigfm skated amuud the same
distance in the ﬁrst heat in 1:26 6-10,
however, to better the mark by even
a bigger margin. When the two
tangle Saturday it should show a real
battle for honors.

Siding Out of Meet

Saling, Iowa university hurdle
favorite, is out of the relays with an
infection but there should be some
stiff running Saturday with Sent—
man of Illinois, Hager of Iowa state,
O'Bl'ienlof Notl'e Dame and Lamson
of Nebraska all among the qualiﬁers,

The boys from across the Missis~
sippi received a setback when Mc-
Dermott, Captain of the Illinois
team, failed to quality at 12 feet 9
inches in the pole vault. Wame of
Northwestern and Canby of Iowa led
the qualifers in this event with 05*
sian of Nebraska. and Lansrud and
Collins of Drake also coming in.

Gordon of Iowa set the pace in the
broad jump by leaping 23 feet 9 1-4
inches and Rhea of Nebraska crack-
ed the'Drake relays record in the
shot put by dumping the metad
sphere 48 feet 10 inches away.

sides of him. Murphy refused to
give up the baton to permit his col-
league to run his heart out when any
effort to overtake the leaders would
have been useless. The crack Mar-
quette team won the medley in 10:23
7-10 to better the mark set by m-
inois last year by 3-10 of a second. '

McIlrath is still entered in the open
two-mile Saturday, however, and
may still regain lost honors. Or he
may run in the two-mile relay which
Grinneli. has entered. Coach G.

Lester Duke would make no deli ite',
statements regarding his plans for
Saturday.

crinnell high school placed slight—
ly better than the college by taking
a fourth in the ado-yard relay. Jef-
ferson won the relay in 46 seconds
for a new meet record with Washing-
ton second and Greenﬁeld third.

Tolun Places Sewnd.

The real treats of the day were
Bracey, Leland and Tolan, however.
The throng had an opportunity to
see Tolan in action three times, the
Inn-yard dash, the 440-yard relay
and the SSH-yard relay. Braccy ran
only in the hundred and Leland did
the century and ran anchor man in
the 44n-yard relay. Leland and

After the speeches, the club mem-

sharp issue with the speakers.

The results of the campus prohibi-
tion poll also were announced at the
meeting. Whereas the Literary Dig-
est records Iowa only 41 per cent for
the enforcement of the present law,
53 per cent of those voting at Grin-
nell took the bone dry stand. The
dampest of the three divisions of the
college who were questioned was 45
per cent for the Volstead law, which
is four per cent drier that the state
as a whole. Among both men and
women the proportion of those who
now drink is identical with the pro-
portion who drank before coming
here, according to the tabulations.
