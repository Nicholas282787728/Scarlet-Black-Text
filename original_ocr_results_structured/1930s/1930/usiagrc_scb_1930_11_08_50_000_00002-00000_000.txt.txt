THE ELEVEN O‘ULOCK HOUR

Tllc Grinnell professors and students should
observe the 11 o’clock llollr of Armistice day Tuess
(lily morning. While it Special cllzlpcl s -llr:c ill
keepmg with the celebration of the memorable day
of 1918 has been held before, the 11 o’clock hour,
observed on the streets of busy mclropoliscs zllld
ill the gradc and high schools of the country, has
passed without notice at Gl'lnllcll college.

A special Armistice day chapel, which will ill-
clude obscrvllncc of the hour before noon Tuesday,
will be held ill the Grinncll high school auditorium.
Rearrangement of the class schedule could llc made
at Grillllcll college Tuesday ill order that chapel
might take place before and after 11 o’clock. If
the chapel committee decides not to change the hour
for the daily service on Armistice clay, professors
should pause for one minute at the appointed hour
Tuesday morning and together with their classes
offer silent thanks.

Monday afternoon the regular weekly faculty
meeting will be held. The Scarlet and Black asks
the chairman to present this suggestion to the
body, feeling sure that observance of the 11 o’clock
hour Tuesday morning will receive unanimous en-
dorseluent.

THE DEMOCRATIC ELUSION

In a recent chapel address, one of the most
frequently exploited of the apologies for democra-
cy, that democracy is a failure, was stressed. Many
point to the fact that dcmocracy cannot be a fail-
ure because it has not been tried, It is pointed out
that, even though universal suffrage has long been
enjoyed in the United States, yet the real power
in economic life is centered in the hands of a. few
Wealthy individualsithat there’s plutocracy and
not democracy.

The answer to this would seem to be that there
could be no more effective and unanswerablc proof
of the futility 'and impossibility of conventional
democracy than to point to the fact that universal
suffrage has been ill the United States for almost
100 years without realizing democracy. If it has
failed so far, what hope is there that the United
States will be a democracy 100 years hence?

Possibly several hundred years from now po-
litical historians will describe dcmocnocy its the
most interesting political ﬁction of the nineteenth
century. It will be shown to have been something
which, as orig‘aally understood, never did or never
wuld exist. ’

The conditions which promoted it and ill con-
junction with which it might have existed, a sim-
ple agrarian society and i1 stable civilization, were
already passing away when the democratic dogmas
were ﬁrst being fashioned. Beforc popular gov-
ernment was realized those social conditions which
were compatible with popular government had dis-
appeared.

Likewise, the theoretical assumption upon
which democracy was launched, the equality of
men, high potential interest in public affairs in the
part of the masses, and penetrating rationality of
the populace in political matters, have been puncs
tured by the development of science and the test
of exerlencc. Hence, the political problem of the
future is not to vindicate democracy, but to seek
some form of social control more tenable in theory
and more adapted to the requirements of the press
one age.

There is, then, no inherent reason why one
should view with cosmic despair the debacle of
the democratic dogma, any more than one should
lament the passing of absolute monarchy ol- feudal
autocracy, There was‘ once as much dismay among
autocrats concerning the decay of absolutism as
is now found in the writings of Bryce, Lippmaun,
and other even more disillusioned friends of de-

DEPRESSION STUDY

The economic pllcnolncllzt of our nation affect
us more than do any other class of common occurrs
cllccs ill our livcs. People live ill a society organ-
ized on all economic basis and all must eat. clothe
and shelter themselves. From thissourcc arries
the great importance to the ordinary mall of the
vagaries of our economic system. .

One of ‘lllc most important of the pllcllmnclls
is the business cycle with its four phases: rise,
prosperity, dcclille, and depression. Tllc dcclinc
has the shortest duration of any of the phases and
it and the ensuing depression gcllcrally make for
the most unpleasant conditions ill our economic
life. It is for this reason that men turn interested
ly wllcll all opportunity proscnls itself for tllclll
to learn at least the symptoms foretelling a dc-
cline even if the causes are beyond their control.
Knowing the symptoms of an approaching crisis
they can prepare for it. and so cscapc its most
dire impositions.

It is much easier to prophesy ill retrospect
than in prospect. The world has just passed
through the declining stage of the business cycle
and the stage of prosperity is not far behind. The
country at present is in the depression. If there
was ever n. time to study the symptoms of all up-
proaching business depression ill the calm light of
retrospection now is the timc. College students
have a peculiar advantage in any formal or in-
formal study they may make of the situation in
their possession of ready access to the best of
books and current articles on the subject and of
the opportunity to avail themselves of the guide
once of mcll trained and experienced in the ﬁeld
of economics.

With all those aids and the present situation
ill a laboratory in which to make observations‘ “the
college student is wise to proﬁt by the opportunity
for close study of this periodic occurrence in our
economic lifc. Only through Sllch knowledge can
conditions be improved.

WHEN THE GRADS RETURN
(From the Den Moinee Tribune)

In American colleges and universities, the typical
homecoming consists in a football game with circus
accompaniments ,a big dance or two, backsleppings and
hilarious greetings, is good deal of more or less furtive
drinking rrom hip ﬂasks, and sometimes the student
production of a rousing stage comedy. In the whole
program, there is almost nothing to suggest that the
college has any connection with intellectual training
or socirtl leadership.

In this situation certain innovations made at the
Grinnell college homecoming this year are noteworthy.
There the homecoming program, while including a. foot—
ball game, a dance, and other testivitles, round room
also for an organ recital and for lerlous addresses by
Henry A. Wallace, editor of Wallaces' Farmer, and Zone
Gale, Wisconsin novelist and playwright.

The experiment showed that even homecomers hp—
preoiate intelligent discussions on farm relief, the thrift.
and problems of modern ﬁction. Homecoming is prim-
arﬂy a holiday, loath to: students and {or returning
graduates, but it can he observed in a manner not en-
tirely out of keeping with the main purpose or the
college or university.

Recital Friday in Chapel

The fifth twilight organ rlacitel,
especially delightful to the music
lever, was given yesterday afternoon
in Herrick chapel by Prof. Hugo
Goodwin, assisted by Prof. David E.
Peck, violinist. These organ recitals
are given every Friday by Mr. Goods
Win as 8. continuation of similar 1‘97
citels that he gave at St. Paul.

One of the most delightful pieces
played by Mr. Goodwin was “The
primitive Organ" (You), The selec—
tion is an imitation of s. {occuto play-
ed hy a very ancient organ with the
flute as its only set of pipes. Clever
suggestions of discord 'are noticed
throughout as well as the failing Wind
supply which finally causes the play-
er to stop abruptly.

The closing number of the pro-
gram was a magnificent selection,
"Toccsts Tu ES FBCNS" (Mulﬁl),
founded on a service in the Basilica
Secre Coeur in Paris. Mr. Peck play-
ed "Adagio from Concerto op. 26”
(Burch) and “Andante from Concere
to E Minor" (Nardini). accompanied
hy Mr. Goodwin at the' organ. The
other numbers of the program played
by the organist were overture, "Fill-
gel's Cave” (Mendelssohn), "Ou
Wings of Song" (Mendelssohn),
”Adagio Triste from Sonata Crema-
tics.” (You), and "Allegro from Sixth
organ Symphony” (wilder)
