more hurdle to be taken before the
campaign can he really successful,
and that is the necessity of collecting
all pledges before April 1 of this year,
a task which in itself will probably
involve some difficulty. He also
pointed out, in a statement published
elsewhere in the SCARLET AND
BLACK today that the addition of
appxoidmately a million and a half
dollars will he used to strengthen
Grinnell's ﬁnancial foundations for
the _f)iture and to strengthen its
teaching staff, and that none of the
amount will go to the Construction of
new buildings. He states, however,
that with this Campaign out of the
way, the road is prepared for build-
ing expansion in the future.

Russian ’Cellist
Will Play Here

(Continued from Fage 1).

When the war came, Piatigorsky,
still very young, found a position
with the Royal Russian opera, ‘Fin-
ally. when conditions in Russia grew
worse and worse, he Went to Berlin.
Here he was the winner of a contest
for the position of first 'cellist of the
Berlin Philhl‘rmonic.

Because of his interest in books
and science as well as his interest in
his music, Piatigorsky has mnde his
home a center for the social gather—
ings of the musicians of Berlin.

Critics Praise Russlnn

Critics have given high praise to
the third of the Russian musicians to
appear in Grinnell this year. “An
artist of the first rank," was the
judgment of a Dutch critic writing
for an Amsterdam paper. Other
opinions from the newspapers of
Paris, Berlin, and the smaller Ger~
man Cities, noted for their love of
good music, repeat this assertion.

Mock Sings With
Chicago Opera

The quahty of her voice and her
excellent technique have made Alice
Mock, colatura soprano of the Chi—
cago Opera company, a favorite with
the Chicago public and critics, Her
vocal range and control, her phras—
ing. and her stage presence have all
brought high praise.

Miss Mack's debut with the Chi—
cago Opera company in “Carmen”
followed four successful years of
concert work in Europe where she
had been studying. She then played
the roles of Gilda in “Rigdletto,”
Nedda in “Pagliacci.” Eudoxis in
“La Juive," and Marguerite in
“Faust," besides appearing in Lak—
me" and “The Masked Ball." In all
of these she scored a decided suc-
cess.

“Competent in every respect, and

 

adhering to a very fine standard of
musicianship. Miss Mock seems dese
tincd to ranlr with that small group
of artists at the Auditorium who, ree
gardless of their other qualities, are
invaluable here in Chicago hecause
of the tradition for serious, sincere.
and unspotted workmanship they as-
sist in etsabllshing.” This verdict
of the Chicago Journal is echoed in
criticisms in the other Chicago news-
papers.

throw. With McCully gone and Ben
Douglas a memberaof the basketball
squad, the Pioneer squad faces the
indoor season without a good high
jumper. Greene and Hensley will
again hold pole vaulting honors.

The team should be a little strong-
er in the distances than last seasons
with Edwards and Seccr returning
and McIlrath and Pye coming up as
cross country veterans. Edwards,
Bean and Gerhardt are expected to
be candidates fo‘r vacant positions
on the mile relay team.

The‘ weight men, Kukolich and
Murray are also backwith the team,
but they are better in the discus than
the shot and will 'count for more
points in outdoor meets. Hank
Thomas, sophomore football star. is
expected to take short sprinting hour
ors this year.

statistics, mathematical concepts are
valuable for the accuracy and pre
cision which they require, Mr. Mc-
Clenon quoted Professor Irving as
asserting.

Professor c. E. Payne acted as
chairman of two sections on history.
One section was on the history of
agriculture, and the other, in which
he substituted for Professor Root
who failed to appear, was called the
new history.

Others of the Grinnell faculty who
attended were Professors H. 5. Con-
