All Tree Types
of This Region
Grow on Campus

Grinnell’s arboreal beauty has
grown from a little lone willow on
a barren prairie to twenty-seven dis
tinct varieties of tree on the present
campus. Virtually every tree which
grows at all in this region may he
found on the college grounds, Be-
sides these there are a number of un-
usual trees which occur but rarely in
this section of the country.

Three definite cycles of tree growth
describe in a general way the de-
velopment of the campus trees. The
class of 1879 planted the northeast
grove of elms and soft maples. Amer-
ican elms are commonest, There is
a row of English elms skirting the
roadway north of Blair hall. Cvcr
by the. heating plant one finds a Sins
gle slippery elm, while rock elms
may he found on the north campus.

The small oaks, red and white, on
the southwest campus. grown from
acrons planted by horticulture classes
of the college in its early days, have
been twice transplanted and are still
flourishing. The English oak origina-
ted a few years later. To the original
stock of soft maples have been added
the Norway maples.

Evergrecns Varied

President Bradley's regime con-
tributed some white birches which
were planted over by the men’s gym-
nasium but which are no longer liv-
ing, the white birches around the flag-
pole, the weeping white birch, the pin
oaks, the evergreens in the same re-
gion, a double row of basswoods east
of the Y. M. C. A. building, the Wall»
nuts of the northwest campus, the
catalpas of the south campus, and the
sycamores. Several kinds of ever-
green are represented; the white,
Scotch, Austrian, and Ponderosa
pines, the Norway, Colorado blue, and

.Douglas spruces, the white fir, the
red and white cedars.

In more recent times three unusal
trees, foreign to this section, have
been transplanted from nurseries. The
sweet gum near the heating plant
is native to southeastern United
States. Southwest of Goodnow ball is
'a southern cypress. This tree com-
monly grows in swampy southern
landwften in from two to six feet
of water. The Ginkgo, north of Blair
hall, is botanically the roost remark-
able of .any known tree. It is the ex-
act link between the pine and fer-n.
According to Professor Conard, this
tree was probably extinct in the wild
state for 2,000 years, although it ap»
pears now in China and Japan in the
cultivated state.

Includes Coffee Tree

A Chinese chestnut, growing north-
east of Goodnow, was given by the
departent of agriculture. This tree
is being supplied by the United
states in an attempt to replace the
native chestnuts, which were largely
destroyed by fungus disease. Horse-
chestnuts and American chestnuts
may also he seen on the campus. Near
the heating plant stands a Kentucky
coffee tree.

James W Infelt, '28, presented the

. three white birches west of the men's
gymnasium. Still the list is not com-
plete. There are the cottonwoods and
the silver poplar, the white and peach-
leaf willows. The green ssh trees, al-
though small, are quite old, as is the
oak-leafed mountain ash. The Ameri-
can larch and the older European
larch thrive equally well. If one were
to make a really exhaustive list he
might add the hackbeny, mulberry,
European mountain ash. crab, and
cherry trees, but these do not belong
to the campus proper. Even the little
Russian olives are “almost trees."

Athletic Departments Buy
Special Camera for Posture

The atheletic department of Grins

ouetteagraph." This machine is a
specially constructed camera which
is to be used to take posture pictures.

better the posture of the students on
the campus. Miss Andersen plans to
take first the pictures of the freshman
girls who received low posture grades
on their physical examinations given
