TIE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

 

The Column c] Find Beauty.

And then there’s the story of the
famous movie reviewer, F. R. F.,
who rated four stars recently when
he asked the college librarian for
the Statistics book by Ibid.

Now that the farrfamous (all the
way to Storm Lake) Prudities is a
matter of history, we can get down
to the more serious and constructive
parts of life, such as opening the
coming picnic season in a fitting
manner.

According to Some Of the students
of astronomy, particularly those who
own old Fords, the blanket-party
season has been open for several
weeks. Perhaps that explains the
bad colds.

However, we are going to wait un-
til the ground is really dry and the
grass is green, and the leaves are
out, and the moon is full, and so on.
Ah. yes, my children, spnng is com-
ing . . . and so are exams.

it is reported that three young
men of the college borrowed the
shower curtains from one hall last
Sunday eve (when of course they
should have been at Christian En—
deavor) for a picnic. Now we won»
der Why!

A proposed method of farm relies
would be for the farmers to rent out
their woodlots at so much a lot to
blanket-partiers. This would also
settle the serious problem of over
population at the various, picnic
spots about the city.

But enough. We do advise you to
try it however. and you'll discover
why ONCE A GRINNELLIAN AL-
WAYS A GRINNELLIAN.

MARKET TIPS

Mr. Bunny Fee, noted speculator,
announced last night that if the
glasshoppers didn't eat up all the
peanuts, he expected to clean up a
large profit on his recent plunge in
the United Peanut corporation,

Mr. Russ Smith, president of sev-
enty—nine (79) loyal Chips, who have
been a vital force on the campus this
year under Smith's leadership, has
announced that while he was busy
on some other matters several cor-
porations, in which he was interest~
ed to the extent of several shares,
went out of business.

Did you notice Dean Beatty's pic-
ture in the Montezuma paper over
the story of the Eagle Boy Scout
who was returning from Europe?
Did you have a good time, Mr,
Beatty?

For the edificartion (eighty five
cents each) of a certain yiung lady
of Cottage Five, Cooper school is
NOT an annex of Grinnell college.

The Prudities may be over but
they're not forgotten. Just look at
the bills. And too, look at the
crowd at the libs every night. Of
course, they might be waiting for a
street car but we think they are try—
ing to make up some of the work
missed during the week previous to
the Prudities. No, its not worth it,
we don’t believe that they ought to
hold the Prudities more than thrce
times each year.
