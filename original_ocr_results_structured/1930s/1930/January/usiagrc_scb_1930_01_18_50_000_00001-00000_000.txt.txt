Shows Luscious Tone

Program Is Full of Variety, Giving
Artist‘chahce to Show Technic

and Impe doable Taste.

By Hugo Goodwin.

Gregor Piatigorsky. young Russian
violoncellist, appeared last evening
in concert in Herrick chapel. as the
third artist on the Grinnell School of
Music recital series. This young
'celllst. who is making his ﬁrst Am-
erican tour. has been enthusiastical-
ly heralded and as esthusiastically
received wherever he has appeared,
His concert here fulﬁlled every ex-
pectation.

Piatigorsky has a luscious tone
and has technique in abundance but
makes all subservient to his impec-
cable taste; he never dazzles his au-
ditors with mere tricks of virtuosity.
He loves his music and leads his
hearers to love it, too.

The ﬁrst group on the program
opened with Frescobaldi’s Toccata.
This was followed by a Sonata in
two movements by Boccherini, who
lived a century and a half later. To
those of us who know the latter
composer chiefly by his celebrated
minuet, the Sonata was a revelation

of beauty. both 'intrinsically and in
the superb manner in which it was
played,

Plays With Char-m

Camille Saint-Seeds: Concerto ind}
Minor followed, Saint-Sachs music
is highly polished, in fact almost too
polished, some commentators aver.
but when played with the restraint
and style of Platigorsky. it took on
great beauty and charm.

The Prayer by Bloch was a feast
of golden tone-color. In the appeal-
ing phrases of this number it seemed
as though the instrument itself were
speaking to us of the experiences it
had gone through during its two
centuries of existence. ‘

By all means the most interesting
number on the program now follow-
ed: the Rhapsodie italiana by Main-
ardi. It seldom falls to the lot of
Grinnell to have here presented by a
great artist the ﬁrst American rendi-
tion of a new masterpiece. but such
was our good fortune this evening.
The Rhapsodie was a most fascina
ing number: modern. free. and virile.
in it, however, modernism never be-
came formless license. Curious
chord progression were freely used,
and most piquant and intriguing
cross-rhythms. it would seem as
though in this work Mainardi has
made a distinct contribution to the
modern repertoire. Needless to say
it was played most beautifully and
sypathetically.

As an encore to this number a
movement from a Bach Suite for

Mixed Dinners Are
Held on Wednesday

The ﬁrst two of a series of mixed
dinners, sponsored this time by the
Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C, A,, were
held in the dorm and quadrangle din-
ing rooms last Wednesday evening.
At the quadrangle, Smith ball was en-
tertained by the ﬁrst floor of Mears
Cottage, second floor of Cottage Two,
and the third floor of Cottage rive.
Special guests were Dean Beatty and
Mrs. Thompson, Smith hall's house
mother. Hosts for the two Y organi-
zations were Blanche Hulsebus and
Orville Shamborg.

At the dorimtory, Building Four
entertained a group of women from
the quadrangle. These included:
Central cottage, third floor; Cottage
Four, second floor; and Cottage Three,
ﬁrst floor. Mrs. Alline, house mother
of Building Four, was a special guest,
while Candace Packard and Charles
Briggs were hosts from the two if
organizations.

other mixed dinners are planned
for the future. Credit for starting
the plan is given to the Y groups, to
Lantern, the student Council and the
Council of House Chairmen. and
Dean Beatty,

Reports on the results of the
two tag days conducted yesterday
and today for the benefit of the
swimming team by the Student
Council and League Board indicate
that about one-hundred dollars have
been raised for the team.

A varsity dance tonight will com-
plete the drive as the proceeds of
the dance will go toward swelling
the fund. All who have bought tags
are urged to wear them to the dance
and those who have not bought will
be given an opportunity to do so.

Cottage Five collected the most
money, having raised approximately
twenty dollars, Building Four was
next with about eleven dollars. oth-
er figures which are all still indefin-
ite are: Mears, six dollars; Central,
seven dollars, Building One, eight
dollars; and Building Three, seven
dollars. Further reports had not
been completed this afternoon.

Cagers Oppose
Billikens Next

Grinnell Plays at St. Louis
Tonight, at Creighton
Wednesday.

The traveling basketeers of Grill-
ncll college. spending the week—end
in St. Louis, will tackle the crack
st. Louis university quintet tonight
after dropping their first conference
setto to Washington university Fri-
day evening, 48 to 22.

st. Louis university, after winning
six straight games, and including
the Pioneers among their victims,
lost to Washington and to South Da-
ltota, giving rise to a plausible
theory that the five senior regulars
might have gone stsl With this
idea upper-most. it is possible that a
second string of cagers may take the
floor against Grinnell at the start of
tonight's contest.

Since the Billikens did not use a
reserve man in the game here. the
Pioneers will be meeting an entirely
new quintet if such a plan is follow-
ed. it is entir‘ely possible that the
veteran crew, headed by the great
scaring forward, Strong, and a clever
defense man, Hunt, may be slated
against Grinnell again, however.

Blucjays Powerful

The cagers will return for Mon-
day's classes here and will then hit
the train again, playing Wednesday
night against Creighton at Omaha.
Led by Captain Louie Trautman, a
veteran hoop artist and a two letter
man, the Bluejays boast a powerful
quintet this season. They lost only
to Washington last season and have
already avenged that defeat this
year. Splitting two games with
Syracuse university counts heavily
on the Creighton record, also. Last
night they added Drake to their vic-
tims by the count of 40-27.

in addition to Captain Trautman,
Coach A. A. Schabinger boasts a.
pair of sophomore stars, Wee Willie
Worthing and Maurice Van Ackeran
to locate the netting with winning
scores.

The Pioneers, who went to St.
Louis with a crippled lineup owing
to the injury of Captain Wilhelm at
Marquette, will probably have their
leader back in the game before they
tangle with the Bluejays.

Powys Will Speak
Here Next Friday

One the evening of January 24.
John Cooper Powys, English novelist,
poet, essayist and lecturer will ap-
pear in Herrick Chapel on the lec-
ture course, Mr. Powys has atract-
ed much attention this year by the
publication of a novel, "Wolf Sol-
vent."

Mr. Powys is a native of Shirley,
Derbyshire, England, and was edu-
cated at Sherborne school and Cor-
pus Christi college, Cambridge uni-
versity. On graduating Mr. Powys
was awarded an honors degree in the
Historical Tripos. As a Staff Lec-
turer for the Extension Societies of
Oxford, Cambridge and London uni-
versities Mr. Powys made a name for
himself in England.

As a critic, novelist, poet, dramat-
ist, and philosopher, Mr. Powys has
attaracted a large variety of read-
ers. His two-volume novel, “Wolf
Solvent,” which was published last
spring, has had a large sale

 

 

Dorms and Cottages Combine to Raise
$100 for Swimmers by Purchasing Tags

Mears cottage took the record for
the fastest sale of all girls in the
cottage, having sold one hundred
percent twenty minutes after the op-
ening of the sale.

Money from the sale of tags is to
go toward the purchase of silk tank
suits and if possible bathrobes for
the entire squad. Funds provided for
the team this year were insufficient
to buy equipment and also send the
squad on the various trips which it
is to take.

Through providing
swimmers with satisfactory equip-
ment and thus enabling them to
make a good appearance at the var-
ious meets they take part in. it. is
hoped to attract to Grinnell high
class tslen from high school teams
to build Grinnell's acquatic squads in
the future It is also pointed out
that with lighter suits the team will
be greatly aided to making faster
time: a fraction of a second often
decides an event in swimming.

Two hundred dollars was the goal
set by Coach Swerengcn as the
amount necessary to buy all equip-
ment necessary. Members of the
swimming team and of the women’s
house Councils made the Canvass of
the dorms and quadrangle.

Monday is Set as Date When
Literary Issue Will
Be Distributed.

An article by Miss Octave Thanet,
noted Middlewester—n novelist, on
the "Gift of the Small College-'will be
a feature of the Literary issue of
the Maltcaser which appears Janu-
ary 20. Miss Gertrude G. regular
professional contributor has suited
ther material to the theme of the
issue by writing an article entitled
”Modern Literary Variations of a
Well Known Theme," which contains
,a parody on the plays of O’Neill and
Luigi Pirandello. Mr. Harry Nel-
son, the remaining professional con-
tributor has submitted another
sketch.

Members of the regular Malteaser
staff have also adapted their work
to the spirit of the issue.
Charlotte .La Bue's short feature
called "All About a Lady” suggests
the varied treatment which a time-
worn joke might receive by such
literary lights as John Lyly. Long~
fellow. and Conrad. Lucile Ratbman
also helps give the issue a literary
flavor by a prolific output of light
verse.

Robert Swift has contributed a
short story “My Men Are Hungry”
which deals with the romantic theme
‘of pirates in true Stevensonian vein.

An interview with Harry Bawson,
nationally known architect and a
former student at Crinnell has been
written up by Kenneth Clayton,
These features together with the us-
ual Malteaser departments will com-

Americans Judge Music by Feelings
More Than by Tradition, Says ’Cellist

“Oh, Ple—e»eze sit down!” exclaimed
Cregor Piatigorsky as he met the in-
terviewer in the lobby of the Monroe
hotel and led the way into a small
sitting-room. in response to the
statement that he was kind to grant
an interview, he replied. “on, no, 1
am glad."

“The weather here—I like it ' he
said very decidedly. ”The cold is like
that in Russia. I like a cold climate
best, like here and in Canada. 1 like
the sunshine and warm weather of
California too, but not as well."

Skiing is one of the artist's favorite
winter sports. Upon arriving in
Grinnell he expressed the desire to
ski here. “i enjoy skiing." be sai .
"1 have not skied for ten yearsiln
Moscow. I tried but could rent no
skis in Grinnell. 1 want to ski now "

Replying to a query as to the dif-
ference between American and Euro-
pean audiences Mr. Piatigorsky said
there were no noticeable differences,
although the appreciation of Ameri-
can audiences was governed more by
intuition than by tradition. to use his

own words. “Americans are governed
by their intuition—their feelingsiin
judging music—not what is supposed
to be good traditionally. That is a
good thing,” he said.

“I like very much to play in
America. This is my first tour. Next
year I will come back. 1 am glad to
come. My last concert in Amerlca

and play there February 7."

The only interval of rest he will
have between tours will be the trip

need,” he said. “I rest every summer
for three months—4 do nothing but

st, Louis, Me. (Special to the
SCARLET AND BLACK)~Combin~
ing a fast-breaking offense with
deadly long shots, Washington drub-
bed Grinnell here last night by a
score of 43-22. The Pioneers were
totally outclassed by a smooth-work-
ing Bear'machine that looked to be
sure conference winners this year.
In a game that was rough and mark-
ed by a high number of personal
fouls, “Moose” Meyer, as smooth 3
forward as has been developed here
in years, and Souselle led their team-
mates on a scoring spree that could
not be denied. For Grinnell, Doug-
las played an outstanding game, while
DeLong also showed up well. The
roughness of the game forced out
Humphrey, Pioneer center, and Cou-
stance, Washington star.

At the beginning of the game,
Grinnell secured its only lead of the
entire contest. when Douglas made
two free throws. Meyer then coun-
tered with a free throw, and a mom~
ent later sank a pretty short shot,
which was followed by two more
“sleepers" by Souselle. This made
the count 7-2. On a fast break,
Douglas, tallied for Grinnell. and
Murray added a basket to make the
score 7-6.

Douglas Tics Score

For the next few minutes. the
game was a nip and tuck affair.
Meyer added a free-throw only to be
followed by a long basket by Doug-
1a: from the side of the floor, which
tied the count at 3-3. Souselle then
uncovered one of his sensational
dribbles, going the entire length of
the floor to make a basket. Not t'o
be outdone, the Pioneers answered
with a nice field goal by De Long,
thus tying the score again, at 10-10.

This was the last threat on the
part of Grinnell, for the Pioneers
could not stand the pace that the
Bears set from then on, Meyer and
Wientge added a free throw apiece
to start the deluge, followed by an-
other free throw by the “Moose” and
a basket by Springer. Murray
brought Grinnell's total to 11 with
a free throw, but two more personals
on the Pioneers gave Souselle and
Springer the chance to make two
more free throws. Another free

Dorm Cage Teams

Both games yesterday afternoon
were close, Four’s A team beating
the A team from Kelly Stables by a.
score of 17-11. only to have the B
game go the other way, with Three
winning by the margin of 13-12.

The games proved to be decided
upsets. The first contest, Three's A.
while piling up no lead. had things
pretty much its own way until Cap-
tain Woody left the game on per-
sonal fouls. This broke up the
Woody-Mcintire-Davis combination
and Building Four seized this oppor-
tunity to make and maintain a lead.
finally winning. Sweeney of
Building Four was lhe most
outstanding man on the court.

By failing to seize last minute op-
portunities Building Four lost to
Three B in a very exciting game
which ended 13-12. The last two
minutes told the story. Four was
leading 12-10, Ross of Three tied
the count with a freak shot and then
Kiesel was awarded a foul shot
which he made good, winning the
game 13-12. Brodine and Ferguson
played consistent games for Four
while Kiesel was the mainstay of the
Kelly Stables team.
