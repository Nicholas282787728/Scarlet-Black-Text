Miles Favors
- Defense, But
No Militarism

U. 5. Needs Adequate Forces
for Safety of Nation,

He Stutesi
Talks Here Friday

Favors Peace Measures — Thinks
Not Safe to Trust to Such

Measures as Yet.

“National defense implies a purely
defensive policy as to the use of
force. while preparation for war
means an offensive one. National
defense is pacifistic, preparation for
war is militaristic," declared Frank
Miles, representative of the American
Legion and editor of The Iowa Le-
gionaire, in a talk on “National De-
fense" in chapel yesterday morning.

“Moreover," continued Mr. Miles,
"ardent study of all measures consis—
tent with our national honor and se-
curity, intended to prevent armc'l
conflict, is involved in national de-
fense."

More Barﬂy Armed Now

Most nations are far more heavily
armed now than they were at the
outbreak of the World war. There
are twenty-four and a half million
men under arms and subject to im-
mediate call in European countries as
against twentyone and a half mil-
lion in 1914. Every nation in Eur-
ope, with the exception rof Great
Britain and the nations which are
not permitted to do so under the Ver-
sailles treaty, has compulsory mili-
tary training, according to Mr.
Miles.

“Japan compels every able-bodied
boy to be a soldier, China is arming
steadily, Russia, whose *Soviet lead~
ers promised a modern Utopia with
peace and love for mankind, is or-
ganizing the strongest military ma-
chine in the world. Great Britain
has the strongest navy afloat, if not
in tonnage, certainly in training,"
said the speaker.

Favors League And Court

Mr. Miles voiced his own opinion,
representative of the legion, in re-
gard to the entrance of the United
States into the League of Na-
tions and the World Court. ”The
United States, because it is the most
democratic of nations, because it is
the most prosperous, because our
people 'have more of blessings and
because we are of the blood of all
peoples is charged with greater re-
sponsibility for world peace, for the
freeing of humanity from the
scourge of war than any other na-
tion. I, personally, favor a League
of Nations, not precisely like the one
now existing, but similar, I favor
our participation in the World
court," said Miles.

"I am devoting all possible energy
toward having a Universal Draft bill
enacted by congress which would
conscnpt money, materials and la-
bor, as well as men in the event of
another war. I favor the establish-
ment in every nation of an Intel-nae
tional Memorial Education Founder
tion, through which students might
be inter-changed by each nation with
all others. I am for any conference
or pact which will lessen the possir
bili-ty of hostilities. I contend that
American isolation( from world af-
fairs is impossible.

oratura soprano from the Chicago
Opera company, “but I go'to musical
comedy for entertainment. I said
that to Gallircurci once, and I was
afraid she would be horriﬁed, but she
just said ‘Yes,, there‘s no reason for
making the opera season longer than
it is.‘ "

European training, Miss Mock be-
lieves, is necessary for Opera work.
“The point is that the thought of all
the operas is European. largely Lao
till,” she explained, “and, besides, be
ing in Europe helps so much in
learning the languages. It is easier
for a young musician to get experia
ence over there, because there are so
many little seasons.”

Eight Winters in Europe

“I studied in Europe for eight
winters, coming back to this coun-
try in the summers because my
teacher was here,“ Miss Mock said.
“I am glad to be working at home
now,"

Miss Mock is an enthusiastic lover
of French music. “I have bcen in

editorial board Tuesday evening.

In his two years in college Mr.

Clayton has been prominent in
journalistic activities on the campus.

would like to give a whole program
of Faure, but of course, that Could
n't be done over here. People are

posers.
Germans Love Music

“The Germans have the greatest
wealth of songs and it takes a ripe
art to sing them. There is a rever-
ence and love for music in Germany;
people don't sing just for money,"
said Miss Mock.

“Concert and opera work are so
different that it's hard to compare
them, but on the whole I prefer the
concert work. The Chicago Opera
company has just been on a Lauri
7,000 miles. We were all over the
country, except that we didn‘t go
very far west this time. We take
about ﬁve operas on tour with us,
usually.

“We ﬁnd a difference in concert
work on account of the radio," re-
marked the singer. “Opera singers
are looking towards the talkies, but,"
she added with an amused smile,
”one has to reduce for the talkies,
and that makes the music practical»
ly impossible. I think though, that
the radio has interested small places
in concert music, and then they want
to hear the musician personally.“

Recital Has Variety

Last Artist on Recital Course Gives
Better Rendition of Earlier '

Part of Program,

By Elias P. Blunl

A song recital by Alice Mock, so-
prano of the Chicago Civic Opera
company, presented Thursday night
in Herrick chapel, constituted
the final number on the School of
Music Recital course for this season.

Miss Mock has a soprano voice of
exqu‘site sweetness and loveliness
that is quite rare among opera sing»
er-s now appearing in concert work.

She excels in that much talked of,
but seldom heard, art of bel canto,
which is nothing less than beautiful
singing. ‘ g

This was particularly evidcnt in
the first two groups of Italian and
French songs and opera excerpts. '

The beautiful cantilena of Don—
audyfs “0 del m’o amato ben," and
Rosa's “Star Vicluo” left nothing to
be desired in beauty of tone, and na-
tural simplicity of interpretation,‘
The grace and vrvacity of Mozart’s
“Non so pin" and the slow swing of
“Muhetta’s Waltz" were a delight
that was. quite uncommon. This was
equally true of each number of the
French group. particularly the Le-
maire “Vous danez, Marquis," inter-
prcteﬁd with a delicacy and spright-
liness that was refreshing.

It is true that thc Waltz from
”Romeo and Juliet," substituted for
the third number, and the English
group at the end. did not measure up
to the standard set in the first two
groups. This may have been due to
fatigue incident to travel in such un-
seasonably hot weather. Nevertheless,
a sufficient amount of extraordinar-
ily beautiful singing was done
throughout the program to make it
a most delightful hour for lovers of
beauty in music.

Architecture ls
Lecture Theme

Alexander States American
Art is Only Starting

to Develop.

“In Europe everything is ﬁnished.
America is the place for the art in
the future," declared Prof. H, 13.
Alexander of Scripp‘s college, Callv
fornra, in his lecture on “Decoration
in Architecture” given last evening
in Herrick chapel. Mr. Alexander,
who is one of the leading authorities
archeology of the
American Indian, spoke especially of
the new American architect
which embodies for the first time in
this country the life and the ideals
of the nation's people.

After a description of the architec-
tural ages of Europe, Mr. Alexander
spoke of America's position in this
art. “In America we are just in the
beginning of an architectural ma—
turity," he stated. “America is
still a virgin land to the builder. Ono
ly recently have we begun to build
structures which have ,meaning,
structures which shall last forever."

“America has three architectural
messages, that is, three buildings
,which reﬂect and interest American
life. The new Nebraska state cape
itol at Lincoln, Nebraska, - the new
Los Angeles public library and the
recently completed War Memorial in
Kansas City are three buildings
which have meaning as well as
form.”

The lecture was illustrated with
stereopticon pictures showing the
unusual work Professor Alexander
has done in planning the decoration
of the new state capitol at Lincoln,
which is considered the finest piece
of monumental architecture recently
erected in this country.

Against Militarism, Miles Wants Youth
Trained ‘to Lick Dickens Out of Others’

“There is a great difference be‘
tween the terms 'national defense‘
and preparation for war,’ said
Frank Miles, editor of the lows
Legionaire. official organ of the Ani-
er-ican Legion in an interview Friday
morning. “Notional defense means
that one is capable of carrying on
war if necessary. Preparation for
war means deﬁnite arming with im-
mediate aims toward war."

“Hate, greed, suspicion, sclfrshncss
of nations cannot be downed im-
mediately. While movements too
ward goodwill such as the present
naval conference at London seem to
be collapsing as far as their Con~
crete aims are concerned, they are
successful in bringing nations to»
gcther toward good wi

 

Ml‘. Miles believes that national
defense should be made secure by
having cvcry able—bodied boy attend
training camp when he isfiftcen
years for two, three or four years,
gaining the fundamentals of war-
fare, but in no sense becoming mili-
tilry minded. ”America has to de-
pend upon citizens for soldiers. NO»
thing in the past history warrants
the belief that there will be no more
war. It is nothing short of murder
to Send out untrained men to face
trained armies. The value of train-
ing camps and military training in
state universities is to prepare our
boys so that in case they should be
called upon to, they can lick the

diclrens out of others!

{Class Cinder
Athletes Have
Annual Meet

Juniors Are Doped to Win
Most Points Today for
‘ Third Time.

Have Many Stars

Douglas, McIlrahh and Edwards
Among Outstanding Juniors

to Compete Today.

Grinnell track fans had the oppor-
tunity this afternoon of seeing the
Scarlet and Black cinder artists take
part in the ﬁrst outdoor meet of the
season, when Seniors, Juniors,
Sophomores and Freshmen battled
for the inter-class championship.
With eight ﬁrst places practically as»
surcd to them, there was little doubt
but that the Juniors would pile up
a score far exceeding the points of
any two other teams.

The class of 1931 has already won
this meet twice. Last year's results
showed the Sophomores with 89
points, the Seniors with 30, fresh-
men 19 and the Juniors trading with
12 points.

Benny Douglas, versatile Grinneu
athlete, and the pride of the third—
year men, participated in a (he
cathlon. Friday afternoon saw him
go through his paces in the high
jump, shot put, 100 metres, 400
metres and the running broad jump.
Benny completed his strenuous pro-
gram this afternoon when he took
part in the pole vault, 110 meter high
hurdles, the discus throw, the javelin
and the 1500 meter run.

Mcnrath Brothers Run

One of the features of -thc often
noon was the mile run, when Howard
McIlrath holder of the Missouri,
Valley championshi , ran against his
brother, Arthur, who is a star mem-
ber of die Grinnell High School track
team. Arthur McIlrath recently
took a close second in the State
High School Indoor Track meet
which was held in Iowa City.

Secor, of cross ountry fame,
should have little difficulty winning
the two'mile run this afternoon,
with McKenzie and Pye taking sec—
ond and third places. Murphy, who
enjoyed a remarkable indoor season,
will most likely take the 880 yard
run, Hugh Edwards and Newsom
following in the order named. The
quarter mile event will be a dual be-
tween Pelletier and Mark, the form—
er being conceded a slight edge.
Hensley, stocky Junior trackster,
should be a high point winner, prob-
ably capturing the low and high
hurdles and the pole vault. Greene,
who has not yet come up to his usual
form should take second in the pole
vault.

Pojman, Thomas Competc

A great deal of interest is center-
cd oi. thc dash events. Joe Pojman,
stellar "prep" performer and
Thomas, sophomore light, will be the
two principal ﬁgures in both the
hundred and two hundred and twenty
yard dashes. From all appearances
Pojman will probably win the 100»
yard dash and Thomas should even
it up with a victory in the 220.

Entries in the ﬁeld events are so
numerous that it is hard to predict
the ﬁnalists. However, Kukolich,
Douglas, and Murray, all Juniors,
should place in the high jump; Golz
and Bowlby in the discus throw; and
Douglas and Murray should do well
in the javclin.

To a large extent today's meet will
Serve as the first serious time trials
of the season, and will give Coach
Lester Duke a line on the real ability
of his proteges,
