The following editorial by the sports editor of
the Scarlet and Black is printed, not only as a
tribuw to Coach J. 0. Truesdnie and his squad of
fighting Pioneers, but in explanation of both sides
of the controversy that arose at the Creighton—
Grinnell game last night. -

THAT TECHNICAL FOUL.

Four of eleven games. Not a distinctive record of
victories perhaps, but who will say that Grinnell does
not today have the outstanding basketball team of
Iowa? Coach J. Truesdale, Pioneer mentor, has .taken
inexperienced material and rounded it with seasoned
men, has fought the handicap of 'size successfully. with
speed and basketball strategy and last night he gave
Grinnell fans one of the greatest exhibitions of a ﬁght-
ing basketball machine that can ever be shown. The
game with Creighton meant much to the coach. It
meant proof that his coaching could overcome great
handicaps, that in face of obstacles he could turn out
a team that was a real threat. He proved these but
despite that the game remains chalked up as a defeat
to Grinnell.

Coach Truesdale practically never protests a de-

sweep

cision on the floor. He permits the referee to handlol
his game as he sees fit. There are probably very few
people in school who have ever seen the mentor angry.
Yet, he rose to his feet at one time Friday night to
protest a decision. The question. The question still
remainsiwas he justified?

Late in the second half Humphrey was standing
in back of Jensen (between Jensen and Creighton's bass
ket) and suddenly reached around and waved his hand
in front of Jensen's eyes. Upon protests by Conch
Schahinger uf Creighton. the officials called it n foul
on the grounds of unsportsmnnlike conduct. To mink
of trying to blind an opponent by waving a. hand in
front of him may seem unsportsmanlike on the face of
it. One can certainly understand the Viewpoint hi the
Creighton coach. Yet. in guarding a man while stand-
ing in front of him, the guarding player nearly always
waves his hands in the air and, if the player is taller
than he, that means in front of the opponent's eyes.
But that is no foul. Players oven wave their hands in
front of the face of a player about to shoot. Even that
is no foul. still. when a player reached around his op-
ponent, without any body contact. to wave his hand
in front of his eyes, it was a foul. Doesn't it seem
possible that Coach Truesdale had some right to com-
plain?

The decision last night meant a point for Creigh-
ton—and Creighton defeated Grinnell by just one paint.
That is neither here nor there in the case, however.
Humphrey acted purely on his own ides, thinking it one
means of guarding a man much taller than himself. It
is something seldom seen in basketball but that does
not make it a [Dull There are two sides to the question
and it needs settling. The affair will at least give bas-
ketball coaches something to consider when they sit

in council again.

UPPER-CLASS ADVISORS

Grinnell already has a system of faculty advisors
for the purpose of assisting her student population to
plan and successfully carry out a four year program
here that will he the most valuable to the students.
Recently, however, a. freshman suggested the extension
of this system of advisory guidance to include a group
of upper classmen in each building, elected each spring
by the men of the building, to act as advisers to the
freshmen during the following school year.

Several other freshmen have been questioned about
the idea and seem in favor of the plan. It is felt that
there were many things in the program of college life
that are new and about which a new man often wanted
advice. The process of electing certain upperciassmen
in each budding to serve in this advisory capacity, and
then assigning each freshman to a deﬁnite adviser, it .s
thought, will make the freshman feel more free to
ask advicepn his own problems. particularly at the first
of the year when he does not always feel that he has
made for himself contacts with upperclassmen of a
conﬁdential nature.

The concensus of opinion seems to he that the numr
ber of advisors should be regulated according to the
number of freshmen, so that no ndvisor would be as-
signed more than two or perhaps three freshmen at
the must. The important feature of the plan is the
assigning of freshmen to deﬁnite advisers, so they will
feel they have a specific contact with an older man in
the building even at the ﬁrst of the year, and so that
the advisor himself feels responsible for the welfare of
certain particular freshmen during their ﬁrst year here.

Since this suggestion of advisory capacities for up-
perciassmen originated with those most concerned and
tc he most beneﬁtted by the plan, the freshmen, it is
wen worth careful consideration
