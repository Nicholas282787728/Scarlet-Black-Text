MILWAUKEE—University of De—
troit-e Titans, who held the Marquette
university Golden Avalanche to a
scoreless tie and succeeded in halting
the Hilltoppers for the only time all
season, have placed four men on the
first all-opponent team selected by
the blue and gold stars.

lowa. Boston college, and Drake
each contribute two stars to the
mythical team, while little Ripon col-
lege pieced one man. Lawrence, Grin-
nell, Creighton. and Butler, other Mar-
quette opponents failed to land berths
on the ﬁrst eleven.

Lynn King, Drake captain and hero
and goat of the Iowans' game here,
is rated as the outstanding player
who faced the Avalanche this fall.

Sneed Gives Thanksgiving
Address at Chester Church

Presenting the proof for the novel
perception that human history runs in
waves of close proximity, and that
by connecting these cycles the gen-
ius for which the world may he thank-
fui is clearly emphasized, Richard
Sneed, '52, student pastor of the
Methodist churches at Searshoro anti
Sonora, delivered the Thanksgiving
day address at Chester.

Sneed emphasized the fact that
Thanksgiving challenges America to
maintain the high idealism that it has

. always held. in stopping to scan the

years of history, the citizen of today
will perceive the waves of human his
tory, and a closer observation will
show him the genius for which he
should be thankful.

giving holidays in Iowa City and

football here, faltered early in the
game when he tossed a lateral pass
which was intercepted by a Mar—
quette end and run back 95 yards for
the winning touchdown.

 

Campus Opinion
\‘Vll'ut do you ﬂﬂxaf the present
system allowing freshman women one

night out during the week?
Mary liont: i think it is all right

i
l
.J

‘during the ﬁrst semester because they

need most of their time to establish
a study program. but the number of
nights might be increased for the
second semester.

l-leien Larrftllec: I think that hav-
ing just one date a week is all right,
lvt they should be allowed to go to
the library without going through so
much red tape.

Edith Jones: The fresh have to
learn to study and they have to stay
at home for that.

Margaret Wright: Freshmen are as
capable of organizing their work as
upper classmen, and should be allowed
more than one night out.

Erma Colo: Freshmen need their
evenings for study.

Kellogg: They will have
grrlmer appreciation of their 5.0an-
more year if they have some restric-
tion now.
