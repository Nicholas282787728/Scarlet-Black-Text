Ciinnell, Iowa

Dear Sir: .

Recently your columns carried in
His campus opinion section the relies
tions of several Grinnell students to
the prevalent system of modified
prepping known as "Hell Week." With
a solitary exception. enthusiastic ap-
proval was valued. The one disap-
proving statement. as it happened,
was incorrectly reported, but even
so, in the general unfavorable corn-
ment which it elicited, it raises the
question as to just how far a Crin-
neil student may frankly express his
or her opinion on a matter of general
interest, and receive a fair hearing.

This correspondent submits that
Grinnell as an institution will be a
much inferior place the moment frank
and candid criticism or any of its
phases ceases to be an actuality.

Whether the question he that of the
support of a so—called Victory day,
or a pep meeting, or a dance ticket
sale, phe unpopular individual is he
who will allow his own intelligence to
dictate his course of action. it is
against such invasions of one’s per-
sonal liberty. and against such den-
ials of one's freedom of opinion and
choice that this correspondent lifts
his voice in humble protest in the
hope that there are some of whom
its challenge will not be as sounding
brass or tinkling cymbal.

Sincerely yours.
Don Brodine.

in Resolution

(From the D ily Trojan)

LOS ANGELES—Deiinitely break—
ing off relations with College Humor,
the Western Association oi College
Comics passed a resolution at its final
session Saturday morning explaining
its attitude. The resolution follows:

“Resolved, that the Western Ass
sociation of College Comics withdraw
from association with College Humor
starting with the next number of each
member comic.

“The history oi the past relations
has guided our action. We recom-
mend continuance of this action in
the future by the association.

Niltiomll Break Suggested

“We ask endorsement of this action
by the liliddlewestern. Eastern, and
suumern College Comic associations.
The Western association feels that
College Humor:

1. Misrepresents college life.

2. Misrepresents to advertisers that
College Humor reaches college leads
ers better than the college comics.

3. Hinders the independence of col-
lege comics.

"The Western Association oi
College Comics is severing present re-
lations with College Humor, because
we feel that it is not to the best in
terests of the universities and college
comics which represent them to be as»
sociaied with College Humor.”

John Gleystccu: Absolutely, al-
though personally I don't care much
for any kind or an examination.

Charles DeLollg: That's a funny
question. 0h. I guess some of them

ercs Tipton: No exam is a fair
test of a student’s knowledge.

Mrs. Clara Dux‘is: There are a
great many things which must be
taken into consideration when ans
,wcring a question oi that type. The
‘subject, type of pupil. and type of tcst
are lactors that greatly affect the
,clement of fairness. 1 think, however,
Lthat, inasmuch as some standards
must be established, the exams are as
fair as any.

Elimbeﬂl Cook: 1 think they are
if the examination is proportional to
the time allotted. However, if the test
is very comprehensive, there is a tend-
ency to unbalance its true measllrev

dent to~burry. In this case he can
give but a brief, rushed record of his
