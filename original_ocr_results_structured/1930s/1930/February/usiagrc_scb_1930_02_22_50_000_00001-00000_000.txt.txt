izen's union issued the following
statement: "In contrast with the
other candidates, the personal quali-
ties of Norman Thomas stand out.
He is a man of ability, learning and
high ideals. . . . He would bring dig-n—
ity and character to the mayor's of—
fice. Ii personal merit alone were to
decide the contest Mr. Thomas would

. win easily.n

Scripps-Howard organ in the metro-
polis, maintained that Thomas was

power of his voice, his character, his
ﬁne intelligence, and his wide and in-
timate knowledge of the problems of
the people and of the city govern—
ment."

The New York World urged its
readers either not to vote or to vote
for Thomas, stressing the letters
“quality of mind, integrity of char-
acter and uprightness and dignity

~cf hearing. The New York Times
paid tribute .to his fine ability and
high character."

Four Elected to
Sigma Delta Chi

Clayton, Clark, Joy 3 n d
Hough are Honored by

Journalism Frat.

Grinnell chapter of Sigma Delta
Chi, national honorary professional
journalistic fraternity for men, enr
nounced today the election of four
pledges to the chapter as the result
of a vote held at the regular semi-
monthly meeting at the Varsity Tea
room Thursday noon. The pledges
are William Clark, Kennem Clayton,
Arthur Hough and Dudley Joy.

It is the custom of the Grinnell
journalism fraternity to elect pledges
in the fall and spring. Last fall
Hugh Curtis, Francis Fee Howard
hfcllrath and Richard Phillips were
pledged. A man, in order to be eligi-
ble for being pledged, must have de-
cided upon journalism as a life work
and at least be in the last semester
of his sophomore year.

All Are Prominent

All four men, who were announced
by offet-ers of the chapter today as
being selected as the spring judges,
are prominent in journalistic work at
Grinnell. Clark and Joy are juniors
and Clayton and Hough are sopho-
mores.

Clark is on the staff of the Mal—
teaser, Crinnell humor publication:
the 1931 Cyclone board, junior class
annual this year; the reportorial
s t a f f o f the Scarlet and
Black, and a contributor to the
Tanager, ‘Grinnell literary magazine.
He had a character sketch used by
the latter publication issuing before
last, and in the near future will have
an article published upon the Amana
colonies, which are between Grin-
nell and Iowa City.

Clayton was an experienced news-

Trackmen Face

Bulldogs Today

Pioneers Are Doped to Win

on Superiority in

Distance Events.

The score was even up as Coach
G. L. Duke left for Drake today
with his Crinnell college track team.
Drake won the swimming meet yes-
terday to take the lead, but Grin-
incl! retaliated with a victory in the
cage contest last night and now the

on the track squad. The cinder
pathway experts are meeting Drake
at the Bulldog field house this sf-
ternoon in an indoor dual.

Campus cinder pathway, which
have seen amorous collegiate couples
wcnding their way about the cam-
pus, arm in arm, year after year,
were barred to young Lotharios. The
mentor has been making use of the
warm weather to put his men in the
best of shape for the dual, for the
indoor training facilities here are
hardly adequate,

After having rated nine points
more than Drake in the triangular-
meet last Saturday, it would seem to
the casual observer that the Grinnell
track team should be able to trim
the Bulldogs again today Coach G.
L. Duke, however, is not at all cer-
tain that this is the case.

Last week Iowa state took points
in the hurdles and dashes which arc
almost certain to be marked down
for the Drake speedsters this week,
Snort and CurryaretheDrake dash
men who have put the voodoo on
Pioneer men. McMichael is schedul-
ed to cop the shot put unless Kukolich
shows some improvement and the
Bulldogs have an even chance in the
high jump as long as Douglas is not
traveling with the Pioneers.

Griuuell is doped to take the dis-
tances, having shown strength there
this year. With the advent of Mur-
phy, versatile half-miler, on the track
squad. the mentor can look forward
to a clean sweep of first places in the
distance events. other eventswbich
look like Pioneer victories are the
pole vault, quarter mile and mile re-
lay.

The personnel of the Crinnell squad
will probably be the same as that
making the trip last week. Despite
the lack of adequate training facili-
ties, the Pioneers have show-o steady
improvement during the past week.

Coach Duke is relying on the

Quad Awaits Own
Ball This Evening

i While the last touches necessary
to turn‘ the men’s gymnasium into a
beautiful, old fashioned garden, fill»
ed with hollynocks and cherry blos—
soms, were being given this after—
noon by the committee in charge of
the Colonial ball, Griunell's co—eds
were preparing for the most elabor-
ate event of its kind in its long his—
tory at Grinnell.

Long, fuilrhooped skirts, basque
waists, powdered wigs, swallow/43.11
coats and picture hatsﬁsll these
were being donned as the afternoon
drew to a close and the time for the
festive dinner together in the quad—
rangle dining room. preceding the
dance drew near. The Georges will
wear button—hole bouquets and Mar—
thas corsages to set off the beauty
of their costumes. The ball is being
sponored by the Women's Athletic
association, of which Miriam Mc-
Nally is president.

When the many Georges and
Marthas enter the "garden” tonight,
through a lattice archway, facing
the colonial pillars of the orchestra
platform, negro mammies will meet
them, and escort them into the trans—
formed gymnasium. whose harsh
rafters will be hidden by the dim
light coming from seventyrflve twink~

Guests will almost immediately hear
the gurgling of water from a foun-

rocks.

Griunell's 1930 Colonial ball will
take place. Music will be provided
by a five-piece orchestra from the
Serenaders, including Charles Lans-
trup, piano; Charles Woody, drums;

Silz Lectures
on Wednesday

‘Romantic Towns of South
Germany’ is Topic

Of Speaker.

“Romantic Towns of Southern
Germany" was the title of an illu-
strated lecture presented in Herrick
chapel Wednesday evening by Dr.
Walter Silz.

Linked with the series on German
romanticists which Dr. Sllz has con-
ducted for the last few weeks this
lecture explained the discovery of the
southern Gel-man towns through the
romanticists’ Cult of medievallsm.
The country around Heideleherg and
Nuremberg and the home of Albrecht
Durer were some of the scenes pra-
sented. Many of the towns are so
far withdrawn as to be little known
to tourists.

Dr. Sllz began his lecture with the
romantic town of Heidelberg, show-
ing by means of slides, how the town
is situated high on hills above the
Neckar river. He then took his
audience through the town, with its
various points of interest, and
through the market place. In the
next town, the audience saw the
huge, old castle on the hilltop with
the town in a Circle around it. One
side showed an airplane View of 5.
small German town of this type. the
castle was in the center, the town
around it and a, wall surrounded the
city.

In each of the towns shown, Pro-
fessor Silz mentioned the prominent
writers of that place, and by giving
German names to much of the archi—
tecture and points of interest, color
was given to his talk.

The river Nectar: was declared by
the lecturer to be the most romantic
river in Germany contrary to the
common supposition that this honor
must be accorded the Rhine.

Intramural Water
Polo Begins Today

Another intramural sport got uni
der way this after-noon when six
dorm water polo teams swung into
action in the pool in the first three
games of a round robin schedule
which will bring each of the six
buildings up against the other five.
Smith opposed Clark today, Dibble
and Three splashed the waves
against each other, while Langan
and Four completed the afternoons
program in the water. Dibble and
Smith tied last year for the chain-
pionship.

C 11st Your Ballot Today
in Student Chapel Pall

At the bottom of this page is
printed again the student ballot on
chapel. Only a smau percentage of
the students have indicated their
opinions on the question to date, and
unless many more cast ballots in the
next two ditys, the investigation be-
ing conducted by the Scarlet and
Black cannot be a success. Even if
you do not favor continuing chapel,
votc anyway, for a wide divergence
of opinion is the indication of wide
student participation. Further ex-
planation of the question is given in
an editorial today. Vote tonight when
you got your paper—it will be the
easiest time to do so.

Drake Mermen
Beat Pioneers

Lead From Start to Win by
51-24; Miller Takes 440

for Grinnell.

Taking first and second in both
hundred and forty-yard sprints and
high points in both medlay and lens
yard relays, the Drake tankstcrs
easily defeated the Pioneer swim-
mers yesterday afternoon at the
home pool by a score of 51 to 24.
Drake lead from the first event to
the last.

Billick, Shaw, and Squier, of
Drake were high point scorers of the
meet, Billick scoring first in the
hundred, and forty sprints and
Shaw seconds in both events. Both
also swam on the winning relay
team. Squier took first in his cvent,
the 200-yard breast stroke, third in
the diving, and swam on the winning
medley relay.

Grinnell slammed the MAJ-yard
winning with the some combination
as at Creighton last Saturday. M .l-
er swam a hard race from the start
to win over Cox by over a length.
Cox took second. This event brought
Grinnell’s score up to within shoot-
ing distance of the blue and white,
but the next event, the back stroke
again increased Drake’s lead.

strong of Drake made a good ex~
hibltion of his diving con-test, tak-
ing a first place over DeLong of
Grinnell. He thrilled the audience
by his narrow margin of missing the
board. One of his dives, a half gain-
er was rated perfect by one of the
judges, altough the final score was
9.

Pioneer Star Slips in Final
Basket as Gun is Poised
to End Thriller.

Is See-Saw Contest

Pioneers Get First Half Lead, Only
to See King Bring Drake Even

by Last Half Shots.

Basketball games come and go
every year but never again will
Crinnell fans see another such sea—
son as this. The first victory over
Drake after two overtime periods
seemed enough, but this was fol-
lowed hy a one point loss to Creigh—
ton and a two point defeat by
Washington university in one over»
time period. This seemed to be over»
doing thrills, but the fans were cap-
able of doing justice to one more
such contest, that appearing last
night when Crinnell trounced the
Drake Bulldogs here, 16 to 15, with
the final count in doubt until the
very last second of play.

The man to man defense of the
Pioneers has accomplished wonders
in holding down Jensen of Creighton
and Meyer of Washington, but it met
an equal defense last night and for
12 minutes of the game neither team
scored. Humphrey broke the score-
less deadlock with a pair of free
throws. The game was well under
way, the Pioneer shooters found their
eyes and led 9 to 2 at the half,
Bowes' ﬁeld goal being the only
Bulldog counter.

King Is ‘Hot’

At the beginning of the second
half, Lynn King, premier Drake
shot, broke out like measles, and
shot from all angles, running the
count to 11 to 9 in favor of Drake
before the stunned fans could lie
termine just where they stood. Cap.
tain Wilhelm of the Grinneliians
made his gift toss good on a double
foul. however. and DeLong’s shot
from the floor sent the count to 12
to 11 for Grinnell. King gave the
Bulldogs a one point margin with
four minutes to go but Humphrey
came right back with a counter for
Crinnell. Modeers free throw knot—
ted the score at 14 apiece and with
only 50 seconds to play Monahan
was fouled by McCreary and he
made his shot good.

Win In last Seconds

Less than half a minute later Mac
had his chance to make good when
he was fouled, but he failed and
things looked black as the timer
reached for his gun. Eight seconds
before the final whistle, however,
DeLong found himself in the open
with the ball in his hands. DeLong
being Grimell’s only bid for “hot-
shot" honors, it meant curtains for
Drake.

King was the outstanding star of
the game with his shots from all
over the floor, none of them set ups
and most of them well out toward
the middle, DeLong led the Grin-
nell scoring, both in quantity and in
timeliness while Ruff and ' Douglas
were right up to form with their
playing.
