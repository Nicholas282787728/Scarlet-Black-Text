THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

 

Debaters Meet
Drake Monday

Hawk, Phillips and Blasier
Defend Advertising

for Grinnell.

Carefully constructed arguments and
well-directed rebuttals kept a crowd
of about sixty persons interested and
laughing at the nonrdecision debate
last Monday evening between Grin-
uell and Drake lieid .at seven thirty
in A, R. H. auditorium. The question
under consideration was, “Resolved,
that advertising as practiced in the
United States today is more harm--
ful than beneﬁcial to society."

Three well-trained speakers pre
sented tor Grinnell the negative side
at the question, leaving the general
opinion that they had a deﬁnite mar-
gin over their rivals in material and
presentation Robert Blasier, Rice
bard Phillips, and Francis Hawk
spoke in the order named in opposie
tion to the three Drake representa-
iives, Marvin Sturtz, Dale Misseidine.
and C, W. Kirkpatrick

Charlton PI‘QSIdL‘S

Professor J. w. Charlton acted as
chairman of the debate. Constnic-
tirc speeches were iiinited to ten
minutes and rebuttals to ﬁve minute
es.

The affirmative based its case on
the contention that modern advertis-
ing is wasteful to society. the con-
sumer having to pay for the high ex
pens s incurred because of advertis-
ing. They also attempted to prove
that advertising is morally degradr
ing, iion~essentlal in the present
economic system and grossly exagr
gerated. As a remedy, they sug-
gested the institution of a national
advertising board or association.

Biasier Speaks First

Gl'lunell‘s negative teain put up a
correlated group of arguments,
Biasier ﬁrst speaking about the close
connection of advertising with the
present economic system and the inn
lenreiated development of advertis-
ing and business.

Phillips arguing second spoke of
the social beneﬁt of advertising in
raising the standards of living. in
breaking down provincial barriers
and in educating the country. Hawk
toldof the past progress of advertis-
aod of the future inﬂuences for im-
provements.

The debate indicated the possibili-
ties of several more spectacular de-
bates on the home ﬂoor. The second
debate of the Drake dual will take
place on February 20 at Des Moines.
betore the Des Moines Ad Club.

Powy; Lecturer ,
and Writer, Speaks

John Cowper Powys. well-known
English writer and lecturer, spoke at
Herrick chapel, Friday, Jan. 24, us-
ing as his theme the division-point
between old-school and new-school
present-day writers. Mr. Powys is
one of an old English family of four
brothers, all artistically significant
today. His novel, “Wolf Solvent,"
published last year, has brought him
wide recognition in this country.

Mr. Powys considers that we may
take 1514, the outbreak of the World
war, as symbolic of a revolution in
literature. Men who have experh
enoed the war have found the old
Victorian attitude incompatible, and
have been forced to resort to new at-
titudes of which the older writers
have no understanding These new
attitudes Mr. Powys has chosen to
call “the foreground mind" and
“Chaoticisni."\

"Chaotlcism" is Revolt.

The foreground mind ﬁnds it
or no avail to try to see life cosmic'
ally, or relatively, but takes the
moment as it experiences it to its
subjective meaning. "Chaoti am"
is a revolt against the attempt of art
to read a harmonious, logical pattern

Leatrice Joy. Waiter Pidgeon, and

production opening at the Strand [07

day. This picture is an adaption of
thc Townsend Martin stage play by
the same naiue.

“Sully" enters into a four day run
at the Strand Saturday uitli Marilyn
Miller. Alexander Grey, and Joe
Brown. The story concerns it poor
orphan girl (have you ever been iin
orphan?) and her ambitions to the
Follies. While employed as a unit-
tross, she meets a deposed Count
(comedian Brown) and also interests
a wealthy chap (lover Grey) by her
grace at the griddle. Like ﬁlly seedsv
Lheir friendship grew.

into life, taking as its supposition a
life in which there are elements esr
sentiaily inharmonious and irrecanr
cilabie. With such an attitude, Mr.
Powys said. it is as natural to take
an idiot for the subject of a story as
a prince.

Mr. Powys threw such of the older
writers as H. G. Wells, G. K. Chester-
ton, John Calsworthy, and Theodore
Dreiser. into sharp contrast with the
new writers, among whom he found
most signiﬁcant Dorothy Richardson
and the three Sitwells. The petty
concern, to Mr. Powys, of such men
as H. G. Wells with the temporal
material movements of the time, he
opposed with the ability of the new
writers to get out of their own time
into past and more congenial Civiliza»
tions. This had been taught to him,
he said, by Dorothy Richardson,
whose new peculiarly clear and femi-
nine viewpoints, presage to him an
age “not of the matriarch, but of the

Powys focused on this pint that any
writer in whatever school or what-
ever time is an artist only in an un-
compromising imaginative presoc-
cupation with nature and the heart
of man.

the second half ended, and both
quints started on the heart-breaking,
breathtaking two overtime periods.

To see the nonchalant way that
the basheteers oi Grinnell handled
the ball in passing reminded one of
the cxpert bail-handling which has
become attached to Pioneer football
teams, and which undoubtedly will
become a trademark of the Scarlet
and Black cagers.

liicCreni-y Plays Well.

At various phases of the contest it
did not seem as though Grinnell and
Drake were waging cage war, but
that Benny Douglas and Lynn King
were having it out. The “blond
blast” of Cedar Rapids Grant high
fame worried the Bulldog forward so
much by his guarding and taking the
ball away, that the Coach Boclter
protege had trouble at times in evadr
ing Douglas and trying tor the
famous “King grandstand" arch
basket,

The small Pioneer guard, who ari-
swers to the Scotch name McCreary,
was a marked inan throughout the
encounter. His sparkling rind Siz-
zling passes proved too much for the
best of the Drake ﬁve. Hanging
back and acting as core of several of
the Pioneer set plays, McCreary dis—
played a deceptive pass which often
kept the towering Bulldog- center,
Schultz. iii an uneasy and nervous
state,

Very little stalling or iaggn'ng was
evident in the fracas. and not a 5116's-
tator could say that he did not get
1's money’s worth, or that the Cone
test was a still atfair. The Grinnell
team had a strong backing from the
strident body, as the east center seer
ticn of the ﬁeldhouse was well ﬁlled
by Pioneer rooters.
