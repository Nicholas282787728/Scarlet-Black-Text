holding a 3 to 0 lead.

Many Substitutes

The third quarter found Smith still
unable to tally after reaching scor»
ing distance, and Gates playing on
the defensive. Four threatened only

The last period found Smith hull

the ball most of the quarter. Play
during the last part of the game was
loose and many fouls resulted. Three
unfortunate fouls by members of the
Smith squad gained as many points
for Gates, the final score being 6 to o.
