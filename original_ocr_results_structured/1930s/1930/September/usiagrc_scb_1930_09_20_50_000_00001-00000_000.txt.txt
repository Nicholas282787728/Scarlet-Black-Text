Two Pioneers
Vie for Guard

on First Team

Thomas, Ruff, Douglas Rest
With Minor Injuries;
Ullrich Good

Simms or Christofferscn That
seems to be the only question left
regarding the vacant guard position
on the Pioneer eleven, It isn't as ser-
ious as it sounds for both will prob-
ably be in the opening lineup against
Iowa Wesleyan next Saturday, but
the question remains as to which will
play center and which will be sta-
tioned at guard. Bradford, a veteran,
will, of course, be handling one guard
position.

Reserve material for the positions
in the middle of the line is found in
the persons of Martin, Figland, and
Murray, the latter showing up pure
ticolarly. Figland, although he lacks
weight, has been playing a great
game.

Timing Plays

The coaches tried Tipton at guard
with little success and he is back at
his old place as reserve tackle. With
the guard position taken care of,
Coaches L. L. “Fuzz" Watt and Les~
ter Duke have been devoting their
isttentions to the timing of plays and
the work of the line men. Coach
‘ att has returned with an entirely
new bag of trick plays this year,
which, if timed correctly, will baffle
the best opposition.

The veteran backs, Thomas, Ruff,
and Captain Douglas, have been
resting the last few days with a set
of minor injuries, but all will be back
in scrimmage next week, They have
been in uniform for signal drill and
passing practice, however. and are
well acquainted with the new plays,

Gulz With (lame i-lip

Ullrich has been playing a good
brand of ball and will probably see
plenty of action this year, while
Hensley, Spengler, Alexander, Mc»
Creary, and Pojman will all be likely
backﬁeld candidates with some addi-
tional training. Ullrich has been
working at half and quarter.

“Fritz" Granund has been filling in
while Douglas has been on the bench
in great style. otto Golz, the little
end candidate, who played in 1928,
has dropped out of scrimmage with
a game hip, but will be back in the
lineup next week.

Wesleyan Has Injuries

Coach Watt did not work his men
in the mornings the last part of the
week and his scrimmages were com<
paratively light, giving his cripples
a chance to get back in shape for
the ﬁrst contest next week.

The Iowa Wesleyan team won the
Iowa conference title last year and
lost only two men. The Wesleyan
crew is having its own troubles with
minor injuries, however, and may
not have all of its veterans available

Mason Ladd of University
of Iowa, Grinnell Alumnus,

Prof. Mason Ladd, Grinnell alumr
nus and professor of law at the Uni-
versity of Iowa, was in charge of

cussion of freshman days here Wed-

Institute literary society while in
Grinnell and also headed the debat»
ing union. He won the Hyde contest
in original oratory, was a dcbater,
and a member of Phi Beta Kappa.

Students Hear Serenaders
at First All College Dance

came acquainted at the first all col-
lege dance of the year last night.
The dance was held in Rand gym-
nasium with Chuck Woody's Seren-

Main Attends
Student Meet

President Delivers Address

at Cornwall-on-Hudson;
Back Today

Pres. J. H. T. Main has been absent
from freshman week this fall in order
to address and attend the Interna-
tional student conference at Corn-
WallmnrHudson, N. Y, “The functions
of the liberal arts college" was the
subject of his address delivered Wed-
nesday evening. He was expected
back in Grinnell today.

The meeting has been in progress
all this week at Storm King school.
Foreign students studying in Amer-
ica this year under the auspices of
the Institute of international Educa-
tion attended.

Addresses were given by repre—
sentative Americans on various pha-
ses of American life. Talks on Amer-
ican ﬁnance, athletics, business, jourr
nalism, society,,and education were
interspersed with trips to significant
American institutions including West
Point, Vassar, cragston Yacht and
Country club, and Bear Mountain
park.

One delegate to the conference will
attend Grinnell this year. Miss Isa-
belle Dedinszky, a fellow of the Roy-
al Academy of Music at Budapest,
will be associated with the Srinnell
conservatory. Yesterday she .deliv-
ered an organ recital before the con—
ference at CornwallronrHudson.

Steiner Finds
Commercialism

in Passion Play

“The Fashion Play of 1930" is the
title of Dr. Edward A. Steiner's lat-
est contribution to magazines. It
appeared in the Christian Century of
Aug. 13.

In contrast to Reinhold Niebuhr,
who Writes in the same issue, Pro-
fessor Steiner finds the 1930 Oberam-
mergau Passion play a disappointing
spectacle, and compares it unfovor-
ably with “Green Pastures.” He la-
mean, its decline from the preference
of so years ago, for now “It is not a
passion, but a fashion play."

Obernmmcrgau Commercialized

The people of oberammergau have
become commercialized, Professor
Steiner feels. ”Baggage is being lug<
ged by redcaps, whosc luxurious
growth of hair indicates that tomor—
row they will be transformed into
Hebrews shouting "Hozannal" in the
morning and “crucify Him!" in the
afternoon.”

The naive simplicity is gone too,
the article indicates. “Painted moun~
talus hide the real mountains; paint-
ed, modernistic trees hide the real
trees, and the disciples sleep on artie
ﬁcial Stones.”

Professor Steiner does not blame
the people of the place. “They are
more shrewdly exploited than they
can exploit us."

“Broadway'has come to Oberztm-
mergau,” concludes the writer, and he
asks, "Will Oberommcrgau come to

 

Broadway?”

Beatty Announces Change
in Dormitory Dinner Hour;

Football Practice Reason

Dinner hour at the men‘s dining
hall has been changed from 6 to 6:15
o'clock, according to an announce-
ment made last night by Shelton L.
Betty, dean of men. The move was
made on account of football practice,
which ends about 6.

Organizations, which usually meet
at 7, are expected to change the
time to 7:15 o'clock in accordance
with the new dinner hour set for the
lmen.

John W. Palmer of Marshalltown,
with a couple of student friends,
stopped in Grinnell Thursday moms
ing to visit his father, J. D. Palmer
of the J. H. McMurray store. Palmer

Collegians, Who Gilrd for Battle,
View Path of Least Resistance

 

.i How’s the new prof in Bus. Ad,
anybody heard? Easy, or will he
clamp down and be hard boiled?"

“Don't know," comes the reply
from a junior standing nearby. “I
have a course under him myseli, but
perhaps I'll change,"

”Suppose the curriculum commit-
tee will let me take 17 hours,” comes
from another who is also waiting his
turn in the registration line. “I'd
better be prepared in case Ryan
ﬂunks me in speech."

Snap or Whizzer

”Who‘s had Philosophy 3377 How
is it, snap or whizzer'!” comes from
still another as he looks up from the
catalog into the faces of his mates.

Such are the exclamations that one
hears from the students waiting
their turn to “Sign up". Many have
conflicts which must be rearranged,
some want to change their major
from English to history, others pre~
fer one professor to another, and
here's one who has trouble in get
ting permission to carry 17 hours. All
this confusion moons troublc for each
one, but think of the professor whose

 

job it is, besides the registration, to

straighten out all these difﬁculties.

Who can blame the instructor for
shouting when along comes some
student who wants only 15 hours,
has no conflicts, and wants no chair
gas?

Somebody Satisﬁed?

But as soon as all this signing up
is completed the trouble has only
half startcd. Then follows the little

' t to the treasurers ofﬁce which
is so important.

“What's this item for? Towel fee?
Why I'm not taking gym, I don't
use a towel."

“Oh! You dirty thing!” comes back
the reply.

”But haven't you made a mistake
in your addition," comes from an—
other. “Thirteen-ﬁfty and nine seven—
ty-ﬁvc isn't twentyrﬁvc and a quar-
tcr, it's only twelltyrfourrﬁfty.”
(Page, Mr. McClennon.)

But soon Friday and Saturday pass
and everyone is ready for classes to
begin on Monday with the cxception
pcrbaps of the instructor, not to
mention the registrar who needs
Sunday to recuperate.

 

High Aptitude
Found Here

Grinnell Freshmen Score

Better Than Average
in Early Tests

“We don't have the results yet,
but it is a safe bet that the results
will be better, if anything, than us-
ual," said :Prof. L. C. Douglass with
regard to the scholastic aptitude test
given to freshmen, “They look like a
good bunch."

The usual rating of Grinnell is a-
bove the average of American col-
lege freshmen, the ﬁgures published
in the Educational Record show.
Last year the Grinnell median was
160, while the average college mede
ian is 140. The median, of course.
is approximately equal to the student
average in any institution.

Haveriord Median High

The Grinnell median, which may
seem high, is on the other hand low
in comparison with some other in-
stitutions. Haverford rated a median
of 222. Dartmouth and Wells each
werc listed at about 196. Moreover
the median is low because of the fact
that many of the large universities,
Harvard, Princeton, and others, use
their own tests and not those of the
American Council on Education.

At Grinnell the women taking the
tests have commonly surpassed the
men. Last year, Professor Douglass
statcrl, thc women averaged about
163 and the men 155. The two high
est medians recorded in the Educa-
tional Record are from Haverford
and Dartmouth. both men's colleges.

Probable Correlation .54

The probable correlation between
scholastic aptitude ratings and an
indivirlual's grades, for his freshman
and sophomore years combined. is a-
bout .54. Professor Douglass stated.
That means that a student's chance
of attaining in grades his aptitude
level is about 54 per cent.

As statistics go this is a high cor-
relation flgure, Professor Douglass
asscrted, but it leaves the individual
with a fairly open field to exceed or
fall below the prophecy of his apti-
tude rating.

President Main Speaks

The ﬁrst chapel will start at the
regular hour of eight Monday
morning, and will follow the accus—
tomed order. Pl'eS. J. H. T. Main will
