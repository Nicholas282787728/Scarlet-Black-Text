THAT'CHAPEL BALLOT AGAIN.

While the student poll on the Chapel service has
created much discussion, and a small part of the stu-
dents have already cast their‘ballots, the great major-
ity of Gﬁnnell students have not yet taken the trouble

lug.

T HE. GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

to tear cut the ballot from this papcr, and to vote upon
the questions raised there. We are therefore printing
the ballot again in today's paper, again asking each
individual to record his opinion, whatever it may be.
We know that there are many to whom maintenance of
the chapel service means nothing; these people will aid
greatly in this investigation if they vote, for no
analysis of the situation at Grinuell can be a, true one
if it does not represent a crosssectlon of the student
body.

Something moic should perhaps be said as to 10
o'clock chapel. The administration believes that chapel
at such an hour disrupts the morning’s program sor-
iously, and that an 8 o'clock chapel is much to be pre-
ferred, as scrvicc at such at hour gives a higher tone
Lo thc rest of the day. However, President Main is
willing to try 12 o'clock, if that hour would receive
widcr student support, hence the choice between 5 and
12 o'clock for the service. Nevertheless, if students
really desire the service at 10 o'clock, and would attend
at that hour, we can see no hal'ln in indicating such a
preference in the second question, after answering the
question as stated. A widespread student desire for
EL return to the 10 o'clock hour might possibly cause the
administration to change its mind.

It is never so easy to vote in such a poll as when
a paper ﬁrst Comes out. Votc tonight or tomorrow,
therefore, and not later than Mon'day, which will be the
last day before the ballots are collected. The Scarlet
and Black will appreciate your slid in helping it to Elis-
cover what Grinnell’s student body really thinks about
the chapel service. E. I). A.

NEW QUAD REGULATIONS.

The changes in the rules regarding entrance and
minutes at the quadrangle the Scarlet and Black be-
lleves arc to be,commendcd. Particularly in allowing
seniors the privilege of entering the quadrangle late
and without penalty the board is recognizing that they
are dealing with women who are capable of deciding
for themselves whether or not their excuse permits
them these additional minutes.

The change in regulations regarding minutes for jun-
iors. sophomores and freshmen will, we believe, de-
velop in them a self-determination which under the
old system of penalties would not have existed.

The new plan of study hall attendance the follow-
ing or two following nights after the number cf per-
nited minutes arc exhausted we think is a definite im-
provcmeut in the regulations In announcing these
changes in rules, the better spirit prevailing Int the
quadrangle was mentioned. These changes will also
contribute and they represent a forward step on’the
part of thc_ League board

 

 

‘Stock Market Crash Ends Old

‘ Economists’ Theory—Charlton

Eunice Cutler Will Present
Piano Recital Wednesday
Eunice Cutler will present her

junior piano recital in Herrick chapel
next Wednesday afternoon at 4:30

 

The common theory that short
selling is a stabilizer of stock values
is discredited by Prof. Joseph W.
Charlton, head of the economics de-
partment of Grinncll college, writing
in a. recent issue of the New York
Times. professor Charlton main-
tains that farm real estate values are
more stable than stock prices.

“The recent boom and crash in the
stock market," hc~says, "have ex-
ploded a long cherished theory of the
economistsithat short selling is a
most valuable stabilizer of stock
values. The activi ies of the bears,
according to this time-honored
hypothesis, so neutralize the enthu-.
siasm of the bulls that the prices of
stocks are kept in line with earn-
ings. Real estate is generally cited
as the classic example of a market
devoid of} this benign inﬂuence.

“The latest statistics tend to dis-
prove this View. During the boom
an the stock market, security values,
despite the heroic efforts of the
bears, parted company completely
with earnings; and consequently,
when‘the belated reaction occurred,
industrial stgcks declined 53 per
cent.

 

“To compare this with the farm
real estate market since the war is
enlightening. Precisely as the war-
induced high prices for farm pro—
ducts bocmcd farm real estate, so the
glut in the world markets for farm
crups beginning in 1920 caused a Col-
lapse. But in Iowa, whore two-dol—
lar com had boosted land values to
unheard of levels, the decline in the
value of farm land following the
1920 peak was only 35 per cent. In
South Dakota, where 'furious specu-
lation in wheat land had been en-
gaged in, the fall was only 42 per
cent, The greatest decline, is per
cent, was in Georgia where tracts of
marginal land passed out of culti—
vation entirely. In no state did the
decrease, in farm values equal the
fall in industrial security values dur—
ing the recent debacle; hence, we arc
forced to the conclusion that farm
real estate values are more stable
than stock prices. ‘

”Whatever the merits of short sell-
ing, it is a poor stabilizer.‘ Consequ-
ently, the ancient theory referred to
above seems doomed to the discard
along with ”new era" economic

l1 philosophy."
