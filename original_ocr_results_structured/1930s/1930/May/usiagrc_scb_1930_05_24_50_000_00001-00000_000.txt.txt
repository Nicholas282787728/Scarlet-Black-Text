May Festival
Takes Crowd
to Old England

Springtime Spirit of English
Village Theme of Fete
Last Night.

Is Given on Campus

Beautiful Nature Dances Precede
. English Scenes; Andersen

Directs Festival.

. By ROBERTA VANCE
The large crowd which witnessed
the May Festival, “Springtime in
Merrie England” presented Friday
night on the middle campus, was de-
lighted both with the aesthetic beau»
‘ty of the interpretive dances and the
general merrlmen't of the English
,village as it participated in its May
Festival.
The festival took place in an out
door ampitbeater whose natural
beauty was enhanced by careful
lighting. A rustic throne placed
against a background of green
boughs formed a fitting center for
the action. '

Every participant entered enthus-
iastically into the joy and merriment
of the performance and the onlookers
soon felt themselves transplanted in»
to the long ago. From the moment
the butterflies and the spring maid-
on: entered, until the strolling play-
ers and villagers left, the spirit of
the age of Queen Elizabeth was let
by all. -

Native Dances Well Done

The nature dances in the first part
Were all beautifully done. The but-
terflies and the spring maiden, the
clouds and the Greek maid-
‘ ens,i and the girls in the
' rose chain and “To Spring," danced
with grace and joyful abandon.
Waves, the lovely scarf dance in
which a scarf contai ing thirty-six
square yards of silk was used, and
which was repeated by request from
last year’s dance recital, was even
better than before.

As soon as the merrymakers en.
tered singing "Lasses and Lads" in

After the Tideswell Processional and
Country Garden by Morrls dancers,
and Sellingers' Round and Bo Peep
by the villagers, Allan A. Dale and
Much, the Miller's son, put on a
fencing bout. Robin Hood and his
band were there, too. and not wish-
ing to remain in the background,
staged an archery contest for the
privilege of choosing the May Queen.
Wind May role.

After her crowning, the merrimcnt
reached its height when the milk-
maids wound the May pole with long
pink and green streamers. After
this the villagers all joined in the
New Castle dance. and the Swords-
mcn entertained everyone with the
Kirby sword dance, in which their
swords were finally interlocked to
form a star. The Ribbon dance was
interrupted by the arrival of a group
of strolling players who staged two
comedy scenes from ."As You Like
It." When the players left, the Vilr

party this afternoon from two to four
O'clock at the college annex. The
day originally selected was Friday,
but conﬂict with other events caused
a change in plans. Those in charge
of arrangements Were Arline Cole,
Jane Lewis, Jane Moore, Eleanor
Noon, and Sylvia Joseph.

 

‘One Little Drink’ ls Cry of Freshmen

Who Find Grinnell Jail Rather Drab

Late last night (it was all of ten
o'clock), as I was tearing my hair for
more copy, and chewing gum to
keep awake, at stealthy tap on the
side door disturbed me. A little fol-
low with a wild look and disheveled
hair slipped in and handed me a
crumpled note.

I took in the situation at a glance,
”We are all in jail. Come down
yourself," were the Words scrawled
by a hand unsteady with emotion.

Matthews' didn't have 8. drop, the
proprietor told me in a whisper.
Only six bottles were available next
door. I tore through the dimly light-
ed streets. Kutish's ﬁlled the quota
to seventeen clinking bottles.

A cubicle brick structure loomed
,up on the horizon. Light shone
through barred windows high up. In
the darkness at the foot I heard
Highﬁeld‘s stern tones dispelling the
motley rabble, gathered to taunt the
captives. A fellow named Norton,
who had a little girl on his arm, was
disputing with a prop inside, the
latter asserting that, ”there ain't no

justice.”

I tried to approach the ediﬁce from
another angle. I jumped through a
hedge, but it was thorny, and Ijump—
ed back. In a few minutes the police
force had left, and 1 was slipping pop
bottles through the bars.

A half hour later I witnessed the
conclusion of the matter. A tall
lean. hook-nosed county attorney sat
behind the roll top desk in the police
office, showing a pipe stem. He was
dressed in gray.

“Can you give a hundred dollars
bond?"

Freshmen faces looked sad.

u1 mean sign a promise to pay."

Three serious-looking upper class-
men volunteered. The captives be-
gan to ﬁle out. A slender youth with
a big drum gave his name as Robert
Adams. A large blond Scotchman
with a clarinet, who had been cheer-
ing up his comrades with “Home,
Sweet Home," admitted the title of
McMillan. “Philip kisser; one L,
please,” mumbled a gaunt ﬁgure in
a long black dress, as it strode away.

loo-Yard Qualifier.

In spite of the gloomy predictions
which surround them. a determined
Grinnell track team will make a des-
perate bid for the Missouri Valley
outdoor championship on Ward ﬁeld
this afternoon. This meet will he the
last appearance of what has proved
to be a successful 1930 track squad.

The Pioneers have turned back me
two leading contenders for the valley
crown, Drake and Washington, in
dual meets this year, but predictions
indicate that the well-rounded but
none too brilliant Grinnell team will
fail to secure the necessary points
under the bombardment of outstand-
ing stars from the two favorite rival
camps.

Outlook Unchanged.

The preliminaries of the loo-yard
and 220-ysrd dash were held yester-
day afternoon and although Grinnell
runners failed to qualify in the 220-
yard sprint and placed only one
dashman in the century, the outlook
has not changed and only bears out
the predictions of Grinuell’s marked
weakness in the dash events.

Both beats of the century dash
were fast, the winners turning in
times of :10. Barron, of Creighton,
by virtue of his wins in his sections
of both ﬁle hundred and zzu-yard
dash, looms as a probable winner in
the finals today. has brightened
Grinhell hopes for the valley title by
the fact that he, by winning the
dashes, may deprive Drake of two
first places that prevlously had prac-
tically been conceded to them. A
north breeze aided the runners Fri-
day.

Thompson of Washington upset the
dope when he raced his way to sec-
and places in both his heat of the
hundred yard dash and the 220-yard
affair.

Crown Expected.

With hopes of fair weather and a.
fast track, the Missouri valley tracck
meet promises to attract its share of
attention and it is expected that an
unusual crowd will be on hand. The
meet will begin promptly at 2 p. m.

The track was in good shape yes-
terday despite a hard rain Thursday
night. The wind and sun dried the
cinder path and after rolling it was
in much better condition than had
been expected.
