AGAINST THE DANCE FEE.
Ruth Suckow brought three serious criticisms

against Grinnell college. She said that Gr‘lnnell is be-
coming too expensive for the impecunious, that the Grin-
uell man typiﬁes handsome mediocrity, and that Grin»
hell is not the place to look tor vigorous or '
thought. '

A compulsory dance'fee
isms more deserved than ever before.

would make these critic<

It would increase

the expense of coming to college. It would make even
rarer the students who have enough originality to spend
Saturday evening in reading or writing, who go skiing
early on Sunday mornings, who buy hooks instead of
neckties. who ﬁnd their social life in hiking, or who lD
any other way diff "from the crowd. It would very
Clearly narrow the limits Within which the Student may
spend his own money, make his own decisions, and ex-
ercise his own intelligence.

These are important considerations. Whether the
increase in dating, the decreased expense, for a few, of
dancing, the equalizing of costs between men and wo-
men, and the social uniformity achieved would compen-
sate, depends on whether the college is primarily a So—

cial or an intellectual institution.

PULITZER FAVORITISM.

Favoritism of Pulitzer interests in the awarding of
the 1930 Pulitzer prize for excellency in reporting mars
the list of recipients of the awards this spring.

Trustees of Columbia university, on the recom-
mendation of the advisory board of the school of joume
alism, awarded Russell G. Owen of The New York Times
one thousand dollars for his account of the Byrd An-
tarctic expedition. Pulitzer established the journalism
school at Columbia, and often the annual recommenda-
tion of the advisory board for the best example of tee
porting has been given for men who wrote under Pulitz-
er contracts or contracts in which Pulitzer interests
were a party.

Descendants of Joseph Pulitzer are now publishers
of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch and The New York
World. Pulitzer himself founded The PostrDiSpatch, and
the paper under his management became international—
ly famous. The Post-Dispatch and The New york
Times helped to sponsor the Byrd Antarctlc expedition,
which is now in Panama on its- return to the United
states, and received exclusive rights to accounts of the
expedition. Syndication of Owen’s stories, sent by wire-
iess from the South pole, brought additional finan-
cial returns to the two papers.

Owen's coverage oi the expeditions acti
the South pole was a task divided into the filing of
daily stories for a period of three years. Stories sent
from the Grai Zeppelin on its trip around the world
were not distributed over as long a period of time as
were those filed by Owen from the Antarctic, but a new
tield of reporting was opened that attracted the Tead~
ing public of the world, and recognition by the, presenta-
tion of the Pulitzer prize for reporting to any one of
the three correspondents, who covered the trip for the
Hearst interests, would have received popular acclaim.

Capt. Hubert Wilkins, who was one of the Hearst
representatives aboard the Grat‘ Zeppelin, also wired
stories, similar to those which Owen flashed from the
South pole, from his base in the Arctic regions.

Pulitzer and Hearst interests are rivals in journal-
ism. The awarding of a prize for excellency in report—
ing should not be intluenced by business interests.
Merit of the work alone should he the judge.
