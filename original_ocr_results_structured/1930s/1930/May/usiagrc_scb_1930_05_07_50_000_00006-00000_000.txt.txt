Grinnell Loses

Tennis Match

Oklahoma Wins Here, 4-2;
Drake and Locals Tie

at Des Moines.

The Grinnell tennis team made a
strong hitl for victory in its match
with the University of Oklahoma
Monday, but fell short, 2 to 4, after
three and a half hours of strenuous
play.

Captain Donald Jones, playing al-
most faultless tennis the first set,
won, 7-5, but in the next two sets he
failed to hold the pace, succumbing
to the southerner's almost uncanny
placement driving, 6—4. 6-1, Runkle
pulled himself out of a had hole in
the second set when he was down a
set and Jones was leading
3-0. Jones' drives may have
proved a little harder but Runkle
amazed the fair-sized gallery by his
ability to cover the court and his
smoothness of play.

Thurman was too good for Kent
and experienced little trouble in
downing the Pioneer number two
man in straight sets, 6-1, 6-4. Bob
DeLong repeated his performance of
last Saturday by featuring in two
of Grinnell's wins. He turned back
McCall, 6-1, 6-4, in the singles and
paired with Allen for a victory in
the second doubles. -McColl, it will
he remembered, defeated Jones
when the Pioneer two-man team
played at Norman during the spring
recess.

The Sooner-s number four man,
Bennett, looked like a champion
from the way he battered his way
to an easy win over Allen, 6-1, ‘6-0.
The Pioneer player won the first
game but failed to present any op-
position in the next twelve.

The first doubles match was a
treat to watch. It was the brilliant
net work of the visitors against the
steady, fighting shots of the home
team. Twenty-two games were,
played before Thurman and Rinkle
finally captured the first set, 12-10.
Jones and Kent held set point on the
Oklahoma pair eight times during
this set but failed to secure the
necessary point to win. The-Pioneer
duo played a better brand of tennis
in the second set and evened up the
county in sets by winning, 5-4. The
southern outfit, with considerably
more practice this season to their
credit, proved the stronger team in
the third and ran it out, 6-4, to win
The match two sets to one.

DeLong and Allen turned in Grin-
Hell’s second win when they won
from McCoIl and Overhausér, 6-3.
’6-4. The Sooner aggregation play-
ed better tennis but found difficulty
in keeping the ball within the court.

Showing continued improvement
as a team, the Pioneer tennis team
died Drake, 3-3, in a Missouri
'Valley dual conference meet at Des
"Moines Saturday. GrinneIl’s win
vehicle through Jones’ defeat of EV-
-erett. DeLong-s victory over Mo-
deer, and DeLong's and Allen's win
in their doubles match. For a time.
it seemed also that Jones and Kent
would take their doubles encounter,
but the veteran Drake doubles com-
bination of Brody and Everett
rallied to win, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3.

In the best match of the after-
noon, the two captains, Jones .and
Everett met, in a setto marked by
,the usual stirring points which oc-

To the Editor
Black:

A contribution to the forum of last
Sunday's Des Moines Register cen-
surcs Grinnell college severely for
trying to “hide" the results of the
prohibition poll from the public.
Evidently there is still‘ some misund-
erstanding about what really hap-
pened.

Dean Nollen did not suppress the
news story. He insisted on certain
changes; notably the comparison of
the results with those of other col»
lege polls. As everyone knows who
has looked into the subject, Grin-
nell’s vote was dry beyond all rea-
sonnble expectation, The suggested
changes were not made‘ because of
lack of time and available data.

Dean Nollen did not ask that we
misrepresent the situation, and I do
not believe that my ﬁrst report mis-
represented it, either. The fact sim-
ply is that the country is so full of
blind intolerance that a college must
be exceedingly careful about the
publicity that gets out.

It is a shame that there are these
intolerant people. We are in a con-
tinual quandary in trying to open
people's minds-there is no greater
function for a small collegeiwithv
out offending their prejudices.

cur when the pick of two teams get
together. Grim-Jen's captain was a
different player from the one who
took the court against Iowa State
the day before and his powerful
backcourt forehand and back hand
drives were sweeping across to Ev-
erett with remarkable regulality.
Drake’s captain took the first set, S-
3, and in the second, after Jones
had won five games straight to make
the count, 5-0, advanced to the net
to volley his way to a 6-5 advantage
and match point on his own service,
but could not overcome the spirit
which Jones manifested. The set
went to the Pioneer leader, 8-6, and
he ran off the third one. s- , to take
the match.

Contrary to the statement in Sun-
day morning's papers, DeLong and
not Allen contributed two victories
for Grinnell. in the singles the Pio-
neer number three man came from
behind to take his match, 4-6. 9-7, s-
4, his steadiness being too much for
Modeer, his opponent. In his
doubles match, paired with Allen
against Modeer and Jensen, DeLong
also played an important part in
bringing Grilmell victory.

Three times in the third set
Drake had match point on Grinnell,
but DeLong, who was serving, kept
to his task ccoly and won his game
to make possible a victory later. As
in their doubles against Iowa State
on Friday, DeLong and Allen played
with just a little too much steadi-
ness for the Drake team. The final
score in their doubles match was,
4-6, 6-4, 8-6.

nell lost, the doubles engagement
