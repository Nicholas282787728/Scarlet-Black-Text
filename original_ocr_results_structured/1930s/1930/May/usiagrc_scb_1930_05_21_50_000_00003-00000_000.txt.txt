_ What with reports of 'marriages
and conditions it seems doubtful that
there will be a graduating class.
Might we suggest that it F10 and
Sue held their prep meetings only

Battling‘Livingston and his
companions a few days ago car-
ried on the cause or chivalry by
spiriting away a fair Montour
maiden from , the Belle Plaine
blackguards. Livingston reports
three knockouts and ﬁve men
crushed under foot betore the law
intervened. The spirit of Crin-
nell commends this heroic action.

Professor Myers, noted tlancer
and tennis artist Who also
teaches economics, has again
solved a great problem. Feeling
that red tennis balls, which he
considers much prettier than
white ones, are not used as much
as they should be,- he has done
some rather intensive reading of
his Pictorial Review, and ﬁnds
that they are being oppressed by
none other than the color blind!

He adds, that though he likes red

teilnis halls, he really doesn't-like the
color as such, as he can prove by the
fact that he never rides on kiddie

teammates. Gates hall got off to
a poor start, Building Three scoring
eleven of its eighteen runs in the
initial inning,
