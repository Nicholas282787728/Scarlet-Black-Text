Pioneers Face
Drake Teams
on Track Here

Varsity, Freshman Squads
Will Compete Friday

Afternoon.

Bulldogs Have Edge

Murphy vs.Gordon HalieMile Feud
Holds Meet Spotlight
in Valley Circles.

Drake rivalry will again flourish
in Grinnell this week when the Bull-
dog varsity and freshman track
teams meet the Pioneer varsity and
yearlings Friday afternoon. Advance
dope favors Drake in both meets al-
though the home outfits are given
outside chances to win.

The Grinnell varsity crack squad
will face one of its hardest tests of
the season when it opposes the re-
juvenated Bulldog outfit. The Pie»
necr team came home ahead of
Drake three times in indoor meets
this season but the visitors will
bring a strong outdoor team to break
the series.

Lansrude smr role-Vaulter

Lansrude, stellar pole—vaulter,
who won first place in the Missouri
Valley Indoor meet, is capable of
topping thirteen feet. The hurdles
and sprints are doped for Drake ma—
terial and the broad—jump will be
a toss-up, along with the weight
events, ,

The feature race of the afternoon
will be the half-mile, when Murphy,
Grinuell's sophomore star, will run
against Gordon, who won the Mise
sourl Valley championship over the
duo distance last year by clocking
1:56, ‘

Gnllnell Good in lertcr—Mile

The quarter-mile should show a
majority for Grinnell with Mark,
Pelletier and Edwards running and
these mcn in turn give the Pioneers
the edge on the mile relay. McWhin—
ncy will be Drake‘s only threat in the
distances and he has twice lost to
Secor over the two mile route this
season. Secor and Pye should be
able to negotiate a victory in that
event while McIlrath is scheduled for
the top place in the mile.

The Grinnell trackmen have chalk-
ed up a record of seven consecutive
victories in dual meets. including an
undefeated record last year, and the
mentor is making a strong bid for
the eighth win. The meet will he—
gin promptly at three-thirty with
freshman events following those of
the varsity.

Three Frosh Ineligible

The Grinncll frosh aggregation
slipped clear off the outer rim of the
dope container this week when the
ineligibility of three of its stars
was announced, The crippled squad
will have to make a decided improve-
ment to come home ﬁrst over the

‘lsullpups unless the advance reports

of the visitors abilities have been
overrated. It will be the second
meet of the season for the Little Pio-
neers who last week won atussle
from the Grinnell high school ath-
letes.

Captain Pojman and Alexander.
Grinnell dash men, will have their
hands full when they face Smith,

O’Neill’s Play .
Will be Given
Again in‘June

Selected

as Drama Production

‘Emperor Jones’

for Graduation.

Lamb to Have Lead

Cast of Semi-Tragedy Presented
December 13 to Act Again;
Phillips to Appear.

“Emperor Jones," Eugene O’Neill’s
play whi ch was acclaimed
when presented in Grinnell
on December 13, has been
chosen by the dramatic department
as the commencement play to be
given Friday evening, June 6. Chi-
ton Lamb and Richard Phillips will
again portray the leading roles/ and
will be supported by the same cast
that was seen in the play before.

The numerous requests that have
been received for a repetition of the
play resulted in this decision. The
play is a one-act production in seven
scenes, a play of gripping illusion
with unlimited opportunities for im-
aginative interpretation which were
admirably carried out by Clifton
Lamb in the title part.

Early Success of O'Neill.

“Emperor Jones” was one of
O'Neill's early successes. It is a
story of the fears of civilization in
confronting the elements, a living
picture of the thoughts of a negro
lost in the jungle of a West Indian
island.

Brutus Jones in the play
former Pullman porter who has
escaped from jail where he was
sentenced for murder, and has suc<
ceeded in making himself emperor
of the island. When. the play opens,
the time has come when the natives
have discovered his game and have
turned against them. His encount-
ers as he ﬂees in the forest make up
the theme of the rest of the scenes.

Lamb’s Acting Praised

While Lamb's vivid acting was the
major point of praise in the Decem-
ber performance of the play. the
work of Richard Phillips as Smith-
crs, the Cockney trader, was also
highly conmmended.‘

The settings, manufactured in col-
lege c’lasses under the direction of
Virginia Read, were also highly laud-
ed in the earlier perfomance.

The cast includes: Emperor Jones,
Clifton Lamb; Smithers, Richard
Phillips; native woman. Luella Hall;
Lem, West Indian chief, Edwin
Liedtke, and Congo with doctor.
Margaret Napier.
