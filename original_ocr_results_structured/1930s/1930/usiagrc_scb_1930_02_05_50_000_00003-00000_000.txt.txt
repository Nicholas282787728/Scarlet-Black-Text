Two undefeated Langan teams
crashed through to win over Smith
by the identical scores of 19-3 in the
third round of intramural basketball
last week. Both games were lope
sided, Langan showing decidedly
superiority in their ability to Work
the hall down the floor for scores.
McCurdy, Bilto and Briggs all play
ed good aggressive games for Lane
gan B; while Kent and Morrison
proved instrumental in the A team's
victory. Langan has the only two
teams in the league that have yet to
taste defeat, while Smith hall hasn't
won a single game so far this sea-
son.

Dibble and Four split their series,
Dibble winning the A game, Four
taking the B encounter. The Six B
team seemed to be on an off-day and
a weak team from Four upset the
dope by handing them a 13-7 set-
back, Dibble A, centering on that
strong combination of Farrara, Neil-
sen, and Tipton found little to stop
them from taking the game from
Four A by e 1978 count.

The strongest teams that
Hall has put into action this year
trounced Kelly Stables in both
games. An all time scoring record
was set by the Clark B team when
they piled up a total of 41 points
during the game, leaving Three with
only 14. Rowe and Edwards were
personally responsible for 29 points.

Clark's A quintet, with the ex-
ception of the first quarter, played
ring around the boys from Three,
winning 2079. Thomas and Murray
were Five's big guns, while Mchitire
was the mainstay of the Kelly Sta—

bles team.

of Parley,

Cottage Five, February 4. (Spec-
ial to the s, and B)\With the return
of Frances Alvord from the East
where she has been making an my
tensive study of “Gangs: Their Cause
es and Effects," the local chapter of
the Racketeer: inet Tuesday night,
and far into the night, to celebrate
with due ceremony their alumna
member's return. Another honored
guest was Miss Harriet (Fatsoi
Potts, a charter member of the or-
ganization. Two neophytes, Miss
Markee and Miss Thiedernan, were
initiated into the order with the cus-
tomary sheet and pillow case cere-
many. Miss Teget's and Miss Dis-
brow‘s rooms were used for the rit-
ual and were dimly lighted with red
and white candles, symbolic of the
red and white corpuscles in the
blood. Three measured knocks ad-
mitted the blindfolded candidates to
the room, after they had been pro-
perly summoned by Miss Vera (Ver-
sky) sterner, who is now the facul—
ty advisor of the youthful sorority,
but who also serves the organization
as sergeant of arms. It is rumored
that the Racketeers may become of
filiated with the national order of A
5. 53s (Alpha Sigma sigma's) in
the near future.

It is too bad that young Yohe has
to advertise himself to such an ex-
tent that he has to sell his picture to
Zez Confrey for the Iatter's personal
use. And then to post it between the
library and A. g, 1-1.! It is surpns—
ing that the popularity contest
should not have turned out more fa-
varably for you, Freddie.

the Bears. Coach Truesdale is con~
fident that his miniature men can
take them, however, if they play a
steady game and keep their wits.

The Creighton sophomore forward,
Van Aokerman, is probably their big
gest threat for he continues to be
the leading scoring man in the con-
ference, setting the pace for even
lanky “Moose” Meyer of Washing
ton.

Trautrnan is Captain.

Van Ackerman is ably seconded in
his expert shooting by the “Big
Three" of the Omaha Hilltop, Cor-
coran, Jensen and Captain Traut-
man. Corcoran is a tworyear vet-
eran guard and a speed artist extra-
orohnh y; Jensen, a sixsfoot—seven
man-mountain, _was high point man
for the Jays last year at center with
219 points, and Captain Trautman
was chosen skipper of the 1929-30
crcw becuse of his clear-headed floor
week and deadly shooting eye. Mel-
chiors, a guard, completes the
Creighton quintet.

Coach Truesdale's outfit has
shown remarkable improvement at“
ter the rest during examinations and
after trimming the Oklahoma Ag-
gies, fought the Drake Bulldogs off
their feet for a second win. The
regulars rested Tuesday afternoon
but started regular drill for the
Bluejeys today. Friday's lineup
will probably see McCreary and
Douglas at guards, Humphrey at
center and DeLong and Ruff at the
forwards.

New Lineup Used.

A new and different Pioneer cage
squad, fresh from exams, ripped in»
to the Oklahoma Aggie: here Friday
night with a vigor which was under
niable and came away with their
first conference victory of the cage
seasan~by a count of 19 to 10. The
Grinnellians held the losers to a
single field goal until the final mine
ute of the play, and held the lead
throughout after McCreary opened
the Pioneer scoring with a long field
goal.

Coach Truesdale sprang a surprise
lineup when he started Mccreary
and Buff and kept Murray and Ed-
man, who had been starting, on the
bench. The new combination worked
with a snap which couldn’t be stop-
ped, despite the fact that they miss-
ed a good many shots. McCrcary
and Douglas played stellar games all
the way, to set the pace.

Ley opened the counting for the
Aggies with a pair of gift tosses but
Mccreary countered wth one from
the ﬂoor and Bobby DeLong sank an-
other to put the Pioneers in the lead,
