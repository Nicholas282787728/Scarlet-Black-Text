Change in Editorial Columns

(Continued from Page 1)

the past two years football. baseball, and track contests have been staged
at night, always meeting with public approval. By installing the latest in
modern flood lighting equipment, Grinnell college is giving the community
and surrounding territory an opportunity to witness and enjoy the benefits
of athletic contests. That the people of Grinnell are taking to night con-
tests is evidenced by the large number of players and spectators who are on
hand each night watching the progress of the newly organized lrittenhall
league.

Grimm—John s. Nollen, dean of the faculty: Football will lose as a
college sport what it gains as a business enterprise by playing at night.
Most of the color and fascination of the game as an all-college festival dis
appears, and the world become that much dulle-r. The gate will have to
work hard to compensate for that loss.

Griuncll—«lohn c. Tru‘esdale, director of llllllcﬁcs: Grinnell decided to
install lights for playing night football as the solution to the local situation.
The demand for games at times when the most people could attend made
this arrangement necessary. By playing on Friday night, the games are
made available to everyone within a radius of 100 miles. This is definitely
a concession to the urgent demands of our friends in business and the pro—
fessions. For two years we have played under lights and are satisfied that
they are practical.

Iowa—Burton Ingwel‘sell, foothnll coach: Grinnell college is to be cone
gratulated on installing floodlights for football. I believe it will be a won—
derful asset to the school, _

Oklahoma A. at M.»——Lynn Waldorf, football coach: Grinnell is to be
congratulated on making the Missouri Valley 100 per cent equipped
for night football. Night football is not a fad but is here to stay. Floods
lights do not require any change in football technique, and I am sure that
the students and fans at Grinnell will be strong for night football. Night
football has been very successful and popular at Oklahoma at. & M.

Christoffersen's consistent passing
makes him a certain winner in [119'

Bowlby, the Muscatine “bonercrush-

his tutors by outstanding defensive
work as a pivot man. Simms is also
a dependable center candidate.

42 Men “’ork Out

The squad now numbers 42 men for

sidelines now with a game knee but

though it will be necessary for him
to wear a brace.
