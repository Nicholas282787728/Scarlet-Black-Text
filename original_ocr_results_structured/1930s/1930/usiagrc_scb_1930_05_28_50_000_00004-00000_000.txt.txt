Shultz Scores nMills"

At the covention banquet in the
Hotel Slavery in the evening Victor
Shultz, Des Moines attorney and edi-
torial contributor to The Register,
spoke. Mr. Shultz was in Grinnell re-
'cently and gave an address before
the Liberal club.

Schools of journalismitermed
“good places to write headlines”4
bore the brunt of sarcasm of Mr.
Shultz's speech. His principal criti<
ism was that jouralism “mills" hold
no constructive part in the education
of college men and women.

To the Editor of The Scarlet and
Black.

A student quoting political i -
formation from The Des Moines Re-
gister recently startled the writer by
his belief that the statements wei~e
impartial simply because they ap
peared in this nominally unbiased
publication. Since The Register is
the only metropolitan daily in Iowa
having a state-wide circulation, at-
tention might well be directed to its
subtiely masked policy in the 1930
senatorial campaign.

Mr. c. c. Clifton's fair and accu-
rate political observations should not
be confused with The Registers gen—
eral policy in this campaign. Neith—
er should the brother-in-law relation—
ship between the publisher of The
Register, Gardner Cowles, and Con-
gressman L. J. Dickinson license
The Register to abandon its slogan,
“The Newspaper Iowa Depends Up-
on." Mr. Dickinson’s candidacy is
and being promoted by The Register
at the expense of the reading public,
which surely has a right to know
where both of the major senatorial
candidates stand, and what they are
saying, and to know this from
“Iowa’s Leading Newspaper."

The Spirit Lake speech of Govern.
or John Hammill, very brieﬂy men—
tioned in last Sunday's Register
compared with Mr. Dickinson’s
lengthy discourse, is just another
typical illustration of the fact that
Governor Hammill's opponent is get
ting most of the space allotted Sen—
atorial candidates. It would be a
serviceable preselection education for
the people of Iowa if The Register
would carry Mr. Clifton‘s fairness
into all of its columns.
