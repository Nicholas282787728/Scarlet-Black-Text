IN DEFENSE 0F IDEALISM
It may seem strange that we should try to do
fend idealism. Wily, no one (lollies that idealism is
at the root of all progress. Surely, we ore taking
an unnecessary burden upon ourselves.

Yet. strange to so . society has alwa)s been an
enemy of idealism Society has always stood for the
status on t has always fought against, progress.
Tllc reason is thl - the class or group ill powcr
wants to maintain its power, and lollieop things as
they are. Ally ”mt '1 or idealistic Shcllcy who
strives for social change is frowned upon as dull-
gel'ousidmlgerous to narrow minds and scll‘isll illr
forests.

We are told lly our parents and llV tho
folk that the youth who pursues idea ‘ ls ll foo

CENSORED RADIO IN MERRIE ENGLAND
(The Des Moines Register)

William Ferrie, a young engineering worker, walked
up to the microphone the other day in England, sup-
posedly to present the Workingman‘s viewpoint in a
series of broadcasts on industrial conditions, Instead of
making the speech he simply said:

"What. I intended to tell you has been so cut up and
censored by the broadcasting corporation that it would
be a travesty to give what is left. For this reason, I have
sent the talk I wanted to give to the press instead."

Then he walked away.

In England all broadcasting is done by a govern»
ment corporation. It has been accused of censorship be-
fore, and has always hotly denied it. By and large, it
appears that it tries to give the different political par-
ties an "even break.” The explanation made this time
by the broadcasting corporation was that it had cut out
of Ferrie‘s specoh some “acrimonious references to mil.
itarism and militarists" which it considered to be irrele~
vant.

The point is that, in the eyes of somebody in power,
militarism and militarists have to be tenderly dealt
with, at. least when that somebody concludes that, in his
judgment, they oughtn’t to be roughed.

It is a fair guess that BBC (the British Broadcast-
ing Co.) is in for some enthusiastic blistering. And it
ought to be.

To the credit of the press be it Said that] the spBECli
that radlo would not broadcast was printed by at. least
some papers.

Meantime the episode can he jotted down as just
one more evidence that control of radio, be it under gov-
crnment operation or private, so long as private opera
Lion has to be on the basis of governmental favor, is al-
ways going to be a lighting ground between those who
want to censor what the public learns and those who figr
me the public to be entitled to all the facts, and in ad»
(litlorl, all the truth.

ANOTHER DEBT T0 IOW’A
(Pasadena Morning Post)

Great men—like gold—are where you find them.
California with its famous universities and scientific in-
stitutions, might not expect a small Iowa college to have
much to offer it. As a matter of fact. some of our
greatest teachers are on the faculties of the minor col-
leges of the Middle West. I am thinking just now, of
course, of Dr. Edward A. Steiner.

Surely no Pasadena visitor in recent years has
brought to Pasadena more in cultural or inspirational
values than has Dr. Steiner in the three weeks of his
present stay. Too generous to take the measure of rest
he deserves, Dr. Steiner has spoken to more than a score
of audiences and on nearly as many subjects. He has
won Pasadena and has been won by Pasadena. I think
he would Come llerc to live if we would qmt asking him
to make 9. speech a day.

Jack Maxfield, '34, president of the
council of House Presidents, correct:
ed some of the fallacies of general-
izations on scientists. Illustrating his
points with biographical data from
the lives of various men of science,
Maxfield explained that the typical
scientist is neither always rich nor
always poor; he is not necessarily a
social freak, nor is he subject to any
particular temperament.

In conclusion Maxfleld pointed out
that the scientist may have distinct
ly original methods of work, any de-
gree of specialization and still prev
duce valuable results. “The scion»
tist," he concluded, “is a human lleV
ing, and is subject to human emotions
and complexes.”

R H. Norton, instructor in history,
expressed a regret that walking for
pleasure and exercise was not more
common in Grinnell. The lack of this
diversion is one of the Chief differen»
ccs in life in America and in Europe.
he explained, and is highly indicative
of the hold that the motor industry
has over Americans

That walking is an asset to educa-
tion was one of Norton's chief cone
tenuous, for, he said, “When the feet
are in motion, the brain tends to be
active.” English universities highly

Concluding his talk, Norton recom-

excellent use or leisure time, and (or
