students when the curtain goes up on the
first night.

But \T'hel'e were the men? There are
seven parts for the play, but not enough
men turned out to complete these seven
tryouts. In tlle screen version, Adolphe
Menjou played the principle male role. Do
most Grillllell men think that drama and
play production are only suitable for the
other side of the campus? Certainly,
Menjou’s preformance was done most credi-
tably and should be an inspiration and an
incentive for Grinnell men to try out for
the part he played as well as the six other
lnell leads for the play.

Drama is not a women’s field by any
means; indeed, solne of the most famous
play writes and actors have been men and
the reputation of the stage has been built
around their work. Last year the men here
at Grinnell afforded the big share of the
entertainment in the production “Androcies
alld the Lion.” There is no reason why
there should not be a large turnout of men
for tryouts in the production, “Stage Door,"
and acquit themselves as did the men in
last year’s cast. G

OUR CAMERA CLUB

The,ideal of any college campus would be
to have enough group activities to interest
everyone. The social committee could do no
better than to strive toward that goal. Last
year a camera club was organized on the
campus. It got away to a real start as an
effective campus organization, and anyone
who is interested in photography should not
pass up the chance to join the club.

It should be stressed that you do not
have to have high price equipment to be a
member, nor do you even need to own a
camera. Any camera capable of taking pic-
tures, and a genuine interest in photography
is all that is asked. Women as well as men
are invited. Plans are being made for a
dark room to be open twice each week where
students may do their own developing. Also,
sevel‘al projects are under way such as an
exhibition of pictures at the White House
and possibly a contest,

The purpose of the club is to increase
interest in photography on the campus. It
meets on the first and third Thursday’s of
the month ill Blair hall. The next meeting
will be tomorrow night.

Keep the date in mind and, if you are
interested in photography, be there

ALL OUT TOR “STAGE DOOR"

All Grinnell students liked the screen ver-
sion of “Stage Door” when it was presented
at a local theater here last winter. Now
the college drama department is attempting
to give us a stage version of “Stage Door,"
to be presented in the Alumni Recitation
hall auditorium. On the first call for try
outs, more students responded to Sara
Sherman Pryor‘s announcement than ever
before for a aGl'TnYiell production. Every-
thing points to a real treat for Grinnell

who have not joined the college hand. These
figures show that there are thirty-four new
men and forty-seven uppervclass men who
play musical instruments. This group, of
course, includes a few men who are now
members of the band, but they are far out-
numbered by the number who are not yet
members.

One of the most frequent questions
asked about the band is, “How much time
does it take?" The band takes very little
of one’s time, just two practices a week on
Monday and Friday afternoons. Also,
arrangements have been made whereby if a
student plays in the band four years he can
earn three credits toward graduation,

Another excuse often heard is, “I‘m not
good enough. This is rather absurb in the
light of the fact that, in most cases, a per—
son has never played with the band and
really doesn‘t know whether he can or not.
After several years of being content with a
mediocre band, there is taking place a real
attempt this year to try and have a band,
representative of Grinnell college,

You can not know how capable you are
until you try, and now is the time to belong
to the band and improve yourself as the
balld improves. If Grinnell college had a 70
or 80 piece band as it ought to have, famous
as an organization, then there might be
some grounds for such supposed inability,
but as it stands now there is no excuse for
any one of these 81 men, who have llldi»
cated that they play a musical instrument,
not at least going over and giving the band
a try.

Sweaters are awarded for three years
service in the band, and increased Student
Council appropriations have made it possible
to think of several band trips, notably to
the Drake game at Des Moines, and also to
consider new uniforms.

We urge all of you, both men and woe
men who play instruments, to get in touch
With Mr. Vagner and at least give the band
a ry.

Now is the time for all good men
to come to the aid of the Faculty
club. Ever since its famed grape
arbor was raided earlier in the
year, patrons thereof have never
been the same. According to our
informant, the Grinnell educators
are not issuing any warrants, but
they definitely feel that some-
body’s cellar is wellrstocked. The
chief reason for their complaint,
they say, is that the club cook
“makes such excellent grape
Jam."

Wcll, we aren’t questioning their
word, but another of our obser—

student here, we never touch 1i-

with Hale, according to Mochl,
someone came up from behind and
clipped him. Elsewise he’d never
