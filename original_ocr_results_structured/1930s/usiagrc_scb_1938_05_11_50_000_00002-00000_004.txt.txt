Camera ‘Stops’ Bullets

Outstanding among the
contributions of student
photographers to science
is the economical high»
speed (1 /1,500,000 of a
second) camera devel-
oped by F, Behn Riggs,
Jr., a Harvard University
freshman. Below is a
speed camera record of a

Student Photos Aid Industry

When the National Board of Fire
Underwriters sought to determine
the accuracy and strength of ﬁre-
hose nozzles, they sponsored a series
of photographic tests at California
Institute of Technology, These two
photos demonstrate how the tests
were made. At the [up the students
are shown adjusting the camera that
will take speeds up to one-millionth
of a second. At the right is the
photo they took of the water as it
came out of the nozzle. The frame
in front of the camera provided the
light for the photograph. \rmc
