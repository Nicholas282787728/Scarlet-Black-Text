This year, in addition
to the grand award of
the brown derby and
others, a new presenta-
tion will be made to the
"m o s t public-spirited
couple on the campus.”
This couple will receive
a pair of DOVES,wllich
we hope will be a subtle
way of telling them
they a r e “slicing.”
Then remember t h e
Brown Derby and the
Brow Bonnet are pre-
sented to the man and
woman who get by the
biggest for expending
least effort.
