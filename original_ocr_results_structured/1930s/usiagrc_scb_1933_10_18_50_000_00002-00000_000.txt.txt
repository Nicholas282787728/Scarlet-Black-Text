THANKSGIVING VACATION

A definite policy in regard to Thanksgi "ng
Vacation should be adopted by the administration
of Grillnell college. Students whose homcs arc not
far from Grinllell are again agitating for dismissal
of classes Friday, Dec. 1, the day follol llg
Thanksgiving, so that they may spend the holiday
with their families.

The chief argument in favor of retaining the
Friday classes is that a Thanksgiving vacation of
four days disrupts the llnity of the first semester
of school, because of the Christmas vacation which
follows closely. This year, the college schedule
was outlined so that the maximum number of holi-
days was included witll the dismissal of classes on
Thursday. Nov. 30, only. If classes were dismissed
Friday also, students lnllst necessarily lose a day
from the Christmas vacation. '

Yet, instructors will confirm the statement
tllat the amount of studying accomplished flu
the Thanksgiving weekend. if students remain lll
G 'inllcll, is practically nil. New students, ill par-
ticular, are anxious to return to their homes for
the traditional holiday, and feel llllrt if they are
asked to remain at school. \Ve believe that the are
gllment concerning the disruption of the unity of
the semester is not of great weight, because the
dismissal of Thursday’s classes does as much to
break into class \\'orlt.as would the dismissal for
the entire weekend. And if students would rather
lose a day from thcil- Christmas vacation than to
lniss out on a home “gastronomic debauch” at
Thanksgiving time, it seems a trivial lllatter over
which to argue.

The administration should weigh carefully the
pros alld cons of the question and decide upoll a
definite and permanent policy so that this agita-
tion and feeling of dissatisfaction concerning tllc
Thanksgiving holiday will not crop up each fall.

CHECK YOUR OWN

A sore spot at every varsity dance is the
checkrroom service which holds good only nmtil in-
termission, at w llch tilllc dancers rush into the
check-room to find their wraps, directed in some
cases by checloroom attendants.

It has been suggested that the check-room ser—
vice be discontinued and each individual bc permit-
ted to place his garments where he secs fit, and
where he will be able to find thcm at intermission
time without disorder.

If the plan wcrc followed, those attending
dances could pass through the vestibule and into
the cloakroom. where they could purchase their
tickets to the dance and enter the floor from the
inner door at which attendants could be stationed.
The outer door to the dance floor from the vest}
bule could be closed’ and locked, halting a draft
which annoys chapel-ones and guests.

PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN GLASS HOUSES

Once more the eyes of the world are on Ger-
many. Once morc the great powers of Europe are
thinking Wild thoughts and making wild stator
incnts about their Prussian neighbor. Once more
the unexpected action of the German Empirc’has

shockcd the world and driven litany of the wisest
diplomats ill all Europe to answer with clllotioll
while their more steady sanity of callllcr days is
lost. Germany has \l'ithdrawll from the laeaguc of
Nations.

At times like this people find it very czlsyto
draw trallgc conclusions about wllat seems to he
tho wicked action of n large group ot people. in
the fi st place they forget the cause of the action.
alld ill the second place tllcy regard all people
within :l nation as thoroughly llll‘llictl ill doing- an
obvious wrong. So Japan on St‘ptqlllllt‘l‘ l8, 1931,
suddenly became a lalld of srvrnt lllilliou wicked
people, By some Strange dcrilh-y .llnlion whose
gm‘crlllllt‘lit had been ilrtil'cl ' seeking (llsﬂl'lllar
Illcllt and world cooperation suddenly grow horns.
illld for awhile many of tho people ill the western
half of the United States would have been delights
(‘d to punish thcsr sinners by tho wholesale slauglr
(or which we log ize '19 war, Of course we for-
got that Japan l \S failing ill her more peaceful
ofiolts lounrd economic security partly hecnuse
foreign nations isolated her by high tariff walls.
\Vc forget that the serious problem of over-popw
lotion in Japan was made nlol'r serious by an Ex-
l-lusinll Art ill America. Most of all wc forgot that
tho lint do lcurnod what illlpt‘l'ialislll ricnnt only
wllrn it was f0 -c(l to defend itself agai st occi-
dental glluboats.

Noll uc are turning our ill will toward Gor-
lllally just as we did 10 years ago. and if we don’t
keep our minds ill control of our emotions, we
shall probably hullcyc the salllc sort of, rid lllolls
stories lvc believed then. \thn Lord Cecil says,
“ x‘cl'lllally has done her best to prevent disarma-
ment," he speaking from emotion and not from
fact. For a years Germany kcpt a crushing and
hllllliliating treaty. Shc destroyed hcr navy and
cut all but 100,000 men of her army. She \ cut to
Lorarlm in 1925 and agreed to never again seek
Alsace Lorraine. She rcnonnccd fort-e as il lllelllr
od of changing any of her boundaries. These
“'0 lcs have been faithiiully kept by German
while the Allies, who agreed at Versailles to ’
arlll, have made no real reduction in army or nan
y, We censor Gerlllany for withdrawing from
the League of Nations which we have never joined.
“'0 censor Germany for wanting to I'Ctll'l“ while
we add $238,000,000 of new building to ollr navy,
the second largest in the world. We ccnsor Ger-
many for breaking up the Disarmalllcut Collferr
once within three months of the time that our own
action causcd adjournment of the London Eco-
nomic Conference.

Perhaps this sounds pro-Hitler. It is not. It
is pro-hulllan. Germany . wrong, but so have we
all been wrong. Ollr Jol} is to make Germany
right, alld we can do that only by understanding
he . On Saturday Hitler said, “If the world dc-
cides that all weapons including the, last machine
gun, are to be dcstroyed. we are ready illlnlcdiately
to join such a convention.” That statement can-
not lightly be passed over. To find how sincere it
is we lluVL‘ only to offer ollr own arms.

THE STUDENT AND WAR

At student chapel yesterday, Dwight Calllpr
bell, president of the Student Council, spoke on the
student and the next war He said that ill addition
to the horrors of war, there is another reason why
we should want to eliminate itiselfrintcrc t.

Because we, the students of today, will ( lrect—
ly bear the brullt of any future wars, we should
concern ourselves llnt with preparing for it, but
making it impossible. In concluding. Campbell
criticized the dangerous bcliel‘ that ill order to ill-
sure peace, adcrlllatc preparedness for war is nec-
ossary.

It is indeed true that the stude of today will
be the oldler of tolllorl'ow, and that thc costs of
future *flghting must be met by us. It is hard to
llclicvc, after the horrors and trials of the last war,
that Mars may reign again. The Disarmament Coll-
fcrence and the League of Nations hold out little
hope for international peace and good will, al-
though they should by all means be supported as
the possible means at preventing a world conflae
gration.

A PROPOSED "STATEMENT" Fort FL‘UNKERS
(Iowa state student)

“One ﬂunk~$25ﬂ

That may be what the father of George College will
read some of these days if George, a student at Blank
university, persists in fluuking courses.

This plan is designed to impress students with the
cost of an education. It proposes to penalize persons
who fail to take their school work seriously enough.

Most people who fail a course attach little impor-
tance to the fact other than a realizatiouivague in
some instances—that they will have to make amends
sometime. They seldom think of failing a course as
the matter of precious dollars wasted, both for them-
selves and their institution.

Undoubtedly the penalizing. plan would decrease
failures.

On the other hand, cribbing would be given imr
petus. For $25 a student could afford quite an exten-
sive "propping” program to holster his scholastic cour-
age. The success of the plan would depend to a large
extent upon a strong police system to eliminate crib-
hing. -

“Don’t make the wrong thing holy,"
cautioned Rev, Grant B. Wilder of

sacred cow in india and of ancestors
in China as examples or peoples bar

“they had made the Wrong thing

In closing Mr. Wilder stressed the

"We are the ones who must bear
the cross of war," dcclured Dwight
Campbell, president of the student
Council.

He went on to explain that the
youth of today must bear the physi-
Cal and economic burdens of the next
war. "We should do everything in
our power to prevent these crosses
from being thrust upon us,

“It is faith in our intelligence that.
must save us from war." Mr. Camp-:
hell concluded.

Vespers Speaker
Stresses United
Aspect of Church

”An institution is no better than
its members," said Richard M. stein
er instructor in applied Christianity
in his address at vesper services Sung
day, in discussing the modern_
church.

This truism applies to Grinnell col-
lege, he declared, because it, too, can
be an excellent institution only,
through the combined efforts of still
its components—faculty, students, di-‘
rectors, parents. -

Mr. Steiner said that just as a coin
lege must combine the efforts of all
its parts toward a common goal, so
must a “united" church have such a
degree of cooperation to lead in the
christian way of life, in order that
the church may survive to lead in the
spiritual course.

“The question is often asked, ‘What
must 1 be to be a Christianylelt is
better phrased, ‘What must I do to
be a christian? "
