Creightonﬁ
Fears Aggies

Hampered by Injuries for
Game Tonight

OMAHA, Nah. Oct, 5 (Special)
—In spite of an epidemic of ail~
ments that has impaired the mall—
power of the squad, Creighton tini-
versity's Blueiays are ready for
the invading Cowboys of Okla-
homa A. and M. who come to
Omaha for a game tonight.

Heaviest blow to the Creighton
squad was the news that Captain
Vincent Anderson. quarterback.
will not yet be in condition to
play. as traces still remain of
the fractured ankle he suffered
in a baseball game this summer.

Hallbacks injured

Both left halfbacks are on the
shelf, temporarily at least. and
may not he ready by game time.
Charlie Klem, the hawk-faced
sophomore who broke into the
limelight in the first football
game of his career last week
against St. Louis. when he passed
with deadly accuracy and Ian and
blocked like a veteran to lead his
mates to victory, is suffering
from a twisted ankle that has
him hobbling.

Bob Zuercher, the other left
halfback star who last season as
a sophomore won all-conference
honors, is in St. Joseph's hospital
with an infected arm due to boils.

End Out

Fritz Bolak, sparkling sopho-
more end who scored the first
touchdown against st. Louis, is
likewise a victim of painful boils
and will be under par against the
Aggies.

with these four headliners on
the sidelines this week, the cali-
bre of the team was unquestione
ably diminished. Team physicians
hope, however, that with good for-
tune all but Anderson may he able
to play,

Fear Cowboys

Head Coach Marchie Schwartz
made it plain last night that he
fears the Cowboys in no uncor-
tain terms.

"This will be one o[ the touglr
cst games on our schedule," he
said. "The Aggies have power
and lots of it, and their 6 to 0 vic-
tory last week over a strong Oklar
homa City U team is plenty of
proof that they carry a danger-
ous offense again this year."

By a margin of a dropped pass
on the Pioneer goal line in the
closing seconds of play, Grinnell
defeated washhurn, 12-6, in the
opening loop tilt of the season last
night on Ward field. Both Grin-
nell scores came in the second
quarter by the aerial route after
drives of 91 and 70 yards respec-
tively.

This was the first Missouri Vale
ley conference victory for the
Grinneilians since 1932. when they
defeated Drake 7-0. and the sec-
ond Pioneer victory in three starts
this season. Last year the locals
won two games, while losing save
en.

Use Laterals

Washburn, using laterals ex-
tensively. had the advantage in the
opening period, one drive being
stopped on the Grinnell 8~yard
stripe when the Ichabods failed
to make a first down by less than
a yard. A second Washburn
threat was stopped shortly after
the start of the second period
when A. McKenna fumbled after
receiving a pass and the Pioneers
recovered on thelr own 9-yard line,

It was at this point that Grim
