OUR CAMPUS HONOR

With this month‘s mid-semester tests, the student body
finds itself put on its honor to eliminate cribbing—«that is
on its honor as long as the professor stands over his class
with a club. What we have been given rather than an
honor system is a policing system.

A real honor program would demand that professors
leave the room during an examination trusting the students
to use no form of cribbing. This sort of system has been
inaugurated in many colleges with Antioch as an outstandr
ing examplel

At that particular school a student finds himself on his
honor in everything he does—he may even be allowed to go
to his room to write his examination; no doors are locked
against burglars, for, strange though it may seem, there
are no burglars.

Our committee has planned the present program with
a Niew to making students honor-conscious. They plan to
abandon the present program in favor of a real honor sys-
tem within the space of a few years after the students have
forgotten that cribbing ever existed on this campus or in
any other place.

It is a commendable project to make the student body
honor-conscious, and the process of orientation though it
may be painful, we hope will be effective.

YOUR HALL ASSOCIATES

A closer relationship between college students living off
the campus and those living in the dorms and the quad is a
condition that needs to be fostered. Life in the halls and
the cottages has much to give those students who live in
town, and in turn these students have a contribution of their
own to bring to the college life. ,

Too often the members of a particular hall or cottage
do not even know what town men or women are affiliated
with that hall. Where there is such ignorance it is, of
course, difficult to promote cooperation between the two
groups. Because of this, it would seem a very good idea
for the presidents of the halls, the chairman of the cottages,
and also the social chairmen to make a real effort to include
in campus life students living in town.

Too often those off the campus feel left out. For in~
stance, there is a man living in town who has received no
communication at all this year from any member of the hall
he is affiliated with. Such neglect is not intentional, but it
should be elminated. Inclusion of town students in at least
occasional smokers and Sunday evening teas would be a step
in the right direction.

NEWS OF THE WORLD
INTERPRETED BY

John Spaulding

Latest reports from Japan
dicate that the war lords are
faced with the choice of declar-
ing war on China and continu-
ing the hitherto undeclared war
or accepting some form of settles
mnet which may be suggested by
other powers.

t r 1

At least two factors make it
seem possible that she will take
the latter course. in the first
place, most of her objectives in
China have been realized, and in
the second place her aggressive
policy has aroused more opposi-
hon from the rest of the world
than was foreseen.

2 s x

The most tangible indication
of this opposition is the confer-
ence now taking place in Brus~
sols. While dissension arose
among the delegates at the first
meeting Wednesday over the for»
motion of committees, there are
ample signs that there will hc
action at the parley.

i, s r

Especially promising was Brit/-
ish Foreign Secretary Anthony
Eden’s speech delivered before
the house of commons just be-
fore he left for Brussels.

In it he promised the United
States British support in any
steps the conference may take
regarding the Sine-Japanese situ-
ation. At the same time he sug'r
gested that Il Duce take the
first step toward returning mau-
dated territory to Germany, and
notified the world that Britain
would not be dictated to on ques
tions colonial.

e o .

Two other items of inherent re—
garding the Japanese situation
came from Tokyo this week. Un-
official reports state that Hitler
may act as referee cf the smo-
Japanese dispute, providing both
sides agree to abide by his de-
cisicn.

s s I

At the some time another on»
official announcement said that
Italy has agreed to join a Ger-
man Japanese unti~communlst
pact. Such an action would
strengthen the RomeeBerlin axis
and put italy as well as Germany
behind Japan in the present dif-
ficulties.

last week was election week
and the electorate took the op-
portunity to settle several issues.
In New York city Fiorello La
Guardia was reelected mayor.
Labor issues played a part in the
Detroit elections where Reading,
supported by the A. F. of lL.

Danzig, free city in the Polish
corridor, may soon be under the
complete control of Nazi Ger-
many, despite the objections of
the League of Nations. The lat-
est step is the confiscation by
authorities of bank deposits of
Jewish citizens.

which might lead to war. on in-
