 

Yet Everyone’s A Lady

With the heyday of the college men‘s musical
comedies terminated with the dark days of '19,
these all/men dramatic groups are just beginning
to regain the ground lost during the past four

slogan. “All our girls are men. yer everyone's
a lady." for coeds have been added to the cast.
The same holds true for the Columbia Uni
versity Varsity Show. Newest addition no
the ranks of the allrnale groups is the Oherlin
College Mummers Club.
