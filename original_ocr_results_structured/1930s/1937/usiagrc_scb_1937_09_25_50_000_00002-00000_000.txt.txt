The burning question today is
how come Cornell beat the Pio<
neers Thursday night, We haven’t
as yet been able to talk to.Ccach
Guy Lookabaugh about the game,
but we have formed a few opin-
ions of our own.

s e s

It is obvious, of course, that
Buffer Cole, the end whom every-
one was watching Thursday
night, had more to do with Grin-
ncll's defeat than any other single
person. His completely unortho-
dox style of play and the way in
which he seemed to know where
every Pioneer play was going
made it almost impossible for any
plays even to get started.

n r .

But there is one thing we can't
figure out. There may be some
perfectly good explanation, but we
haven’t heard one yet. Why,
when Cole was coming in so fast
and landing on the back of every
play, did Crinnell call so many re-
verse and spinner plays, which
take a little time to get under
way, especially so early in the
season, when backfield timing is
bound to be a little off? it
seemed to us that here lay the
major defect in the Pioneer at-
tack.

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

SATURDAY, SEPT. 25, 1937

 

LOOKED BEST

sit; - ,
RICHARD BOILER

Although the Pioneers suffered
a s to o detest at the hands of
the visiting Cornell team Thurs-
day evening, the play of the above
two men, Richard Boiler (above),
end, and track Osborn (below),
guard, wns not dimmed. They
stood out for Grimlell in the sen-
son’s opener.

A good deal of credit must go
to Fred Homann and Vern Robin-
son fcr showing late in the sad
ond half .that this Cole could be
taken care of. After they went
into the game Cole's play became
far less spectacular. _It looks as
though Robinson is finally going
to get the chance he has been
working so hard for. Lockabaugh
has been watching him and work»
ing with him to develop ;him as
a quarterback. His play Thurs-
day showed the results of that
work.

i; n n

There is one more thing to say
about that game that a lot of us
haven’t thought of. Had the
Pioneers gotten a few breaks late
in the game like the ones Cornell
had earlier, the score might very
easily have been much different.
The Pioneers played a vastly im-
proved stylc of football in that
second half, showed a little good
blocking, and tackled far more
effectively than they had earlier.

s r s

But the. game did show that
the Pioneers are going to need a
lot of work before next Friday
when lows state Teachers will
blow into town with a good tough
team led by a sophomore back by
the name of Dutcher, who can do
almost anything there is to be
done with a football. He’ll. be a

good boy to watch next week.

an exhibition of Cole's ability at
end. Time after time be broke up
Crinnell's spinner and reverse
plays before they got started.
He made tackles on his side of
the line and on the other. In the
middle of the second quarter the
Pioneers began to get 0019': num»
her a little bit, and things work—
ed better. The boys threatened
several times during the last part
of the third and the early part of
the fourth quarter, but in each
case untimely fumbles ruined any
scoring chances there might have
been. At one time the Pioneers
fought to the 10-yard line after a

fifteen yard drive by Buck Snow,
but in this case the Cornell line
held for downs.

Uunouestlonably the best man on
the field was Cole, but Peterson
and Brand contributed some good
ball clu‘rying. For Grixmell Evans,
Sampson, Snow, Boiler, Osborne
and High looked best.
