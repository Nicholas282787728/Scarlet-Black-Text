COOPERATE WITH THE PRESS!

How many times we hear the public
cursing newspaper reporters when a story
appears with incorrect details! But how
many times do we hear the public take one
to itself the blame for such accidents?

Very seldom.

The fact of the matter is that the
blame belongs in many instances with those
very critics.

Time after time a reporter, doing his
level best to cover a story thoroughly, is
met with indifference or simple impatience
when he tries to get correct spellings or
proper titles, 'Often he finds people unwillr
ing to give out the whole story for fear of
adverse publicity.

Needless to say it is extremely difficult
to write an article whose truth cannot be
questioned if only half the truth is known
by the writer. Often the reporter’s only ref-
erence for correct spellings and titles is the
person being interviewed If the latter does
not take pains to make these clear, he can
scarcely blame the newspaper for mistakes.

The reputation .for careless mistakes
which has for so long hung over the news-
paper office is popular tradition which
might easily be thrown into the wastebasket
if the public would offer wholehearted co-
operation to the newspapelx

No person acquainted with journalism
offices can help but know that this reputa—
tion has grown past all true proportion.
Neither can that person help but realize
that the justification for such a reputation
has been laid more often by the public than
by the newspaper,

Cooperationion extra minute of the
public‘s time for the verification of some
detailithat is all the reporter asks. And in
return, he offers a correct story, A story
which because of its co 'ectness is always
fair, presenting the individuals case in the

best light possible for all to SOC,

AFTER GRADUATION WHAT 17

After graduation, what“.7 As we pro—
gross farther up the scale in our college or»
reers more frequently do the thoughts of
most of us try to solve that question. The
college student who has work awaiting him
after commencement day is fortunate,

Obviously the most important function
of any higher institution of learning is to
prepare most of its students adequately for
their chosen vocation after they leave, For
this reason and because of the increasing
complexity in our American life the college
vocations class has come into being, Al—
though still ill rather a formative alld ex-
perimental stage in the American college
curriculum, it serves a useful and needed
purpose to tllc student.

Very soon on the Grinncll campus will
come the announcement of the start of the
vocations class, and with it later on next
spring will be the vocational discovery trip
or “job hunt," These are arranged pri-

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

marilv for fourth year students and every
senior is urged to take part in them,
Neither the vocations class nor the “job
hunt" can fall to benefit every senior, and
the \l'holcehcartcd support and cooperation
of every senior is necessary to make each
one a success and to make each one as ben-
eficial to Gl‘illllell’s seniors as possible,

SOMETHING DIFFERENT

Have you a radio, and if so do you very
often listen to anything except a dance or"
cllestra? Perhaps you do, but many people
do not realize the potentialities for profit
and enjoyment the radio really holdsiapart
from the swing bands.

When urged to give other programs a
try, students arc likely to counter that after
a day’s grind with classes and studying
they are ready for relaxation, and that
popular music is most conducive to that
state. In current parlance, the_‘ve “got
something there,” but ill the iiitcrcsts.of
variety it would be beneficial every once in
a while to try a different sort of program.

Here are the names of a few programs
advanced merely as suggestions, but with
the certain knowledge that they will prove
interesting if time permits you to listen:
Edwin Cl Hill‘s “Your News, Parade," Jose
Iturbi‘s Sunday Evening Hour, Metropolitan
Opera Auditions of the Air, Lowell Thomas,
Dorothy Thompson’s “People in the News,”
Helen Menkcn’s Famous Actor’s Guild,
Kathryn Craver’s “News Through a Wom-
an’s Eyes," and the Commentator Forum.

THE SHIFTLESS AND THE LAZY

(Reprinted from the University News.)

The October issue of The American
Mercury carries all article by Channillg Pol-
locl: which asserts that the only division
of labor crying out against the modern in,
dustrialist is that composed of the ignorami;
the shiftlcss and lazy, It continues with the
theme that “the hardest, most important
work is done at desks and drafting boards,
in offices and at home, and even on the golf
course.” It is a statement such as this with
which we go eagerly into diatribe,

In the first place what good would in,
ventions and pretty pictures of buildings
and bridges, resting whole and entire ill the
minds of geniuses, bring the world, if they
did not come to life through the toiling
hands of labor? Now it is readily admitted
that the inventor should get a good major-
ity of the cream for his travail, but why
should he get all of it and leave only the
skimmed milk for his hirclings? Certainly
the worker owes a debt to the inventor, bllt
true is it also the inventor owes an almost
equal one to his menial aids,

It is agreed that the industrious, the

,willing, and the intelligent, who put their

faculties to good use, have a better chance
and a far greater right to achieve success
than the shiftless alld indolent parasites.
How often have we seen enterprises, small
and large, go “under new management"
time and again, inadvertently suffer failure,
but ultimately brought back to life by ill-
dustrious and able owners or managers. On
the other hand, only a fool would be unable
to parallel these cases ith the incident of
failure forced upon willing and ambitious
men and women who were unable to locate
that much needed “break” which would
open for them tllc way to success,

It all filters down to the crystal clear
fact that most men will work even when
they see only a modicum of success the re,
sult of their trials. Only a few will refuse
to go into movement, will prefer the para-
sitical condition of “living off the town.”
The number of complaining workers today
is far too great to be smllgly categorized,
each and everyone, as lazy ne’crrdowvclls.

“We cannot afford to let the accident of hirth
rrlpplc the educational opportunities of youths of
promise. Our colleges and universities must ex-
Lend their teproots until they reach all classes of
society.” Harvard's Pres. James Bryant Con—
ant justified Harvard's new policy of awarding
more and higgcr scholarships to promising students.
