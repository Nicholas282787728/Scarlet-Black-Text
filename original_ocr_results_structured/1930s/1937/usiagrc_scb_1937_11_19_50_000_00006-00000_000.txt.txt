Alumni Fund Outlined by Executive Secretary

Kerr Gives
6 Poinl' Plan

Voluntary Contributions
Suggested in Program
of Alumni Council

A plan for a Griiinell Alumni
fund in the near future, following
preparatory work by the Griunell
Alumnl council, has been an—
nounced by R. Y. Kerr, executive
secretary.

The plan, according to Kerr, is
based upon alumni interest in the
college and its work and not
upon any sense of formal obliga-
tion.

Some lllalie Gifts.

“Occasionally," Kerr stated, “a.
graduate, knowing that his educa-
tion cost Grinnell more than he
paid for it, has made a gift equal
to this difference in cost. OfLenr
times such a course has been
suggested to graduates, but this is
merely a convenient and wholly
arbitrary way of arriving at some
figure. It represents no policy of
the college, and there is no obliv
gation, legal or even ethical, upon
the graduate to make up the
difference."

Kerr pointed out that the
Alumni council believes that Gl‘lllr
nell graduates will welcome the
opportunity to share systematical-
ly in this contribution to society.
and that many have hesitated to
send in gifts because it seemed
to them that such sums. by them-
selves, would not count for much.

Fund Machinery.

“The machinery of the fund,
however," Kerr explalned, “is be—
ing set up for the purpose of
massing many gifts and making
them one large gift.

“A thousand gifts of 51 each
are, of course, equal to one gift
of 51.000 and 4,000 gifts of $10
each are equal to the annual earn—
ings of a million dollars in the
endowment," he said.

“The cooperation of many can

ing the financial problem of the
college,” Kerr declared.

The following is a brief outline
of the Alumni fund plan, as
planned by Kerr.

to be made by alumni and not by
the college. The appeal is to be
based wholly upon the interest
of Grinneli people in the college
and the work it is doing now. The
council wants these gifts to be
continuous, year after year.
Third, the council knows that
this interest must depend upon
the information the graduate has
about the college and what it is
doing now. The first responsibility
rests upon the council and the
college office to see that Grinnell
people have this information.

Weather affects one's mind,
says Prof. William E Petersen
of the University of Illinois The

number of patients who enter Illi-
nois hospitals for treatment of
mental illnesses rises to a peak in

the alumni; and the uses to which
the money is put will be determin-
ed by the alumni representatives
on the council.

Sixth, the money raised will be
currently spent and not added to
the endowment. ’I'he alumni gifts
are to he considered as really en—
dowment earnings and will be
used in that way.
