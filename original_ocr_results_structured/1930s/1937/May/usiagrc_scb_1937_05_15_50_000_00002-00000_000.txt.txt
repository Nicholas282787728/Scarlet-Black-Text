MORE ABOUT VOCATIONS ,

Now that the year is almost over and another series of
Vocation class meetings is about to be completed, our
thoughts turn to plans for next year. What does lie in
store for the Vocations class”! Continued success we hope.
With that ill view we suggest these changes from the
present procedure. ‘

Because the nature of this course is that of surveying
the vocational field and bringing to Grinnell outside men
and women experienced in their respective fields to discuss
the merits of different jobs and the qualifications necessary
for employment in them, we feel that the course should be
taken in the junior year. When prospective employers
point out the inadequacies of one‘s present course of study
it is too late to change his chosen curricula during the senior
year.

Furthermore, too many students start their last year of

college with no definite end in mind beyond graduation.
This absence of purpose means a lack of drive and initiative
resulting in a confused state of mind, hardly a wholesome
situation for anybody who is about to be faced with earnlng
his livelihood. ‘

Therefore, we suggest that a course be required for all
juniors complementary to freshman orientation, for which
credit shall be given, and of which an instructor shall be in
charge to scientifically conduct a survey of the vocational
possibilities existing in the world today, so many of which
are unknown to the average student,

In addition, vocational discovery tlips such as the ones
so successfully executed this year would remain projects for
the senior class to organize with the aid of the vocational
guidance intructor, and the college employment and ap-
pointment bureaus, This class project would depend entir»
ely on the initiative of the students who had already receiv-
ed an introduction to the various oppoltunities which are to
be found in the industrial, scientific, professional, and hear
demic fields, and in the arts.

We feel that a vocational guidance department organiz-
ed along these lines would be a progressive step in education
and in keeping with the liberal spirit of Grinnell collegel

IS MY JOB MY OWN?

A single sentence from the Boston Globe—“If, as the
present theory seems to indicate a job is to be regarded as
property, can it he bought and sold ?”~calls attention to an
important but rather less generally discussed element in the
strike situation.

Should such a concept of labor rights eventually work
out, it is highly possible that a vicious circle would be
created in which the employer would be at the mercy of the
worker and vice versa, An employee, once he got into a
job, would be able to keep anyone else out if he so wished
and might be as inefficient as he pleased in his secure posi-
tion of “owner" of his job. On the other hand, an entre-
preneur who had vacancies in his plant by reason of deaths,
newly-created positions, etc., could possibly hold out for an
exorbitant fee before hiring some man. Just who would
come out on top' it is impossible to say, but celtain it is that
such a conception of jobs will only enhance the conflict
already existant in a serious enough condition between labor
and capital,

Where then is freedom of exercise? Should something
of this sort develop more quickly than it now seems possible,
what will be the position of the college graduates of two or
three years hence? It is scarcely a problem which the
college generation can shunt to the side as of little conse
quence to them

Organized peace movements are in full swing through-
out the colleges of the country. Is this labor situation al-
ways to be left in the hands of congressmen and politicians?
Is it not also worth our consideration as a problem even

more closely concerning us than “International Relations ‘2”

NEWS OF THE WORLD
INTERPRETED BY

John Spaulding

For the f t time in history the
world this week had the opportu-
nity to hear a king crowned and
sec pictures of the ceremony alr
most as soon as it was over. It
was a forceful reminder that modr
ern methods of communication are
not limited by any boundaries.

5. r ,-

This close connection between
parts of his kingdom and the world
was stressed by King George VI
in his coronation address, as an
important factor in promoting
world peace.

l, l r

Dorothy Thompson, in her speech
delivered to the Union League club
in New York, and reprinted in
last Sunday's Des Moines Regisr
ter, comes to the conclusion that
the weakness and irresponsibility
hf our institutions is due to us as
individuals. This is a little hard
to take yet we must admit the
truth of many of her statements,
particularly the one relating to
the type of people in public ser-
vice.

r i, .,

English institutions scern wor-
thy of some study in contrast to
our own view of Miss Thompson’s
criticism. It is worth noting that
the coornation of King George VI
is the result of an incident which
was a severe test of the stability
of English government, yet failed
to disrupt in

n r r

The explosiuu which damaged
the British destroyer Hunter is be-
ing laid at the door of the Span-
ish rebels. This is relatively unr
important in itself but we must
remember that it was a series of
incidents of this type which led to
the world war. We hope that
"John Bull” has not forgotten.

n s s

We see that certain of our con-
gressmen are going to oppose the
sale of helium to foreign govern-
ments even though it might pre»
vent other incidents like the Hin-
denburg disaster. Nationalistic
feeling apparently blinds these
representatives of our government
to the value of human lives and
cordial relations between nations

Radio reports early this week
suggested that c. I. 0. members
would join in a boycott of the state
of Massachusetts because of the
alleged interference with union
organizers by state authorities.
To date no action has been taken
but it will be interesting to see
whether the union will have
enough influence over its mem»
bers to make such an action effec-
tive. .

Dick Mel-1111's successful round
trip flight to London for corona
tion pictures impressed us with its
superficial appearance of nanchar
lance. It reminded us a great
deal of Lindberg‘s famous flight
with its hours of preparation be
hind the easy performance.
