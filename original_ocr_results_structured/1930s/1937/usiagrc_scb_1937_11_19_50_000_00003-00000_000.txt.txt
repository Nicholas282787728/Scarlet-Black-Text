(he cliicoyo Caugwgalimmlchtb. Nolr
ten rolilled his address “The Cooyrc—
yotiordl Contribution to Higher Ed-
'ucall'mi.”

With the recent tercentenary
of the oldest American institu-
tion of higher education, the
Congregationalists of the United
states completed full 300 years
of college building.

Probably few congregational—
ists have studied this long his.
tory with suff‘ ient attenh‘on to
be aware of the capital and quite
unrivalled contribution of their
brotherhood in the field of high-
er education. Congregationalists
were not only first in the field;
they have been to this day the
most persistently successful col—
lege-builders among all the re-
ligious bodies in America,

John Harvard.

It is an extraordinary fact that
within ls years after the “May—
ﬂower“ landed its ll families at
plyrnouth, the General Court of
Massachusetts Bay colony voted
to found a college “to educate the
English and Indian youth in
knowledge and godliness," and
two years later a Congregational
minister named John Harvard
bequeathed part of his estate and
his name to the new institution.

In contast with this early zeal
for education in Pilgrim Masada
chusetts. it took the Anglicans
85 years from the landing at
Jamestown to start the college
of William and Mary. One hun—
dred and forty years passed after
the first settlement on Manhat-
tan Island before the New York
loyalists founded King‘s college,

later to become Columbia univer»
sity; the Presbyterian collcge of
New Jersey (later Princeton) was
but slightly older, and Baptist
Rhode Island college (now Brown
university) was rounded in years
after King's. The Methodists
were even later in the field.
Superior Quality,

The most remarkable
about Congregational enterprise
in higher education is not so
much priority in time, but the
persistence of superior quality
through 300 years, keepingl pace
with the geographical expansion
of the country.

The five Protestant denomina—
tions which were the earliest col»
lege builders in the United states
were the Congregationalists, the
Episcopalians, the Presbyterians,
the Baptists and the Methodists.
Among these, Congregationalism
has not only done definite pio-
neeringl in education for men, for
women, for Indians and negroes,
and in coeducation; it has main-
tained an extraordinary record of
leadership in the quality of its

34 Institutions.

In the wide stretch of territory
from Maine to California, one
may count at institutions, each
of which is the best of its partic-
ular type in its own state; of
these as leaders in their areas.
28 are colleges and universities
founded by Congregationdh’sts,
and six were founded by repre-
sentatives of the other four de-
nominations mentioned. Consider-
ingl that these other four have a
total membership in this region
fully 15 times that of our church
es, it would seem as if Congre—
gationalists had done relatively
about 60 times as good a job as
the other denominations in build-
ing first-class colleges.
