WHAT IS A READING PERIOD?

Friction has arisen between faculty members and stir
dents over the abolitioll of reading period, which used to
come a few days previous to semester and final tests The
basic point of difference seems to be the definition of the
term ”reading period ”

The reading pel d was instituted at G"nnell to give
students an opportunity to do reading pertaining to their
courses of instruction but not assigned for classwork. This
extra bit of study was intended to help students gain a more
rounded knowledge of their courses, to give each individual
a chance to investigate the phases of his courses in which
he was especially interested. Such is the attitude of most
professors, and such was the purpose of the period when it
was first introduced.

To students, however, “reading period" does not have
that meaning. They believe it should be a time in which to
review the things that are hazy in their minds, to do the
reference work they have not already done. From their
point of view, a better term for that period preceding tests
would be “review period.”

If students and faculty members would come to an
agreement upon the interpretation of the term, results more
satisfactory to both might beGobtdined. —G. E.

NO MORE FIRECRACKERS'

Poor children! There will be no firecrackers this
Fourth of July. The Iowa General Assembly has become
the cruel stepfather who forbids the little children their
simple pleasures. As usual in such cases the children will
not realize how fortunate they are to have a stepfather, but
in time they will see that “he" was looking out for their
interests.

The legislators are to be congratulated on their action.
We hope that_the law will be strictly enforced, for then
perhaps, welwnl be spared the gruesome spectacle of hun-
dreds of chlldren maimed and injured in Fourth of July
celebrations. How much better a safe and sane Fourth
will be. 4. S

Gloomy Sermons Not New
Started in 2800 B. C.

Syracuse, N. Y.——(ACP)7Ser-
malls of today’s “glaumstel‘s,” who
View the World “with alarm," are
much like those preached scores of
centuries ago.

So said Dr. Frederick 0. Perry,
president of Hamilton collcgc. on
the basis of writings taken from
an Assyrian tablet, dated 2300 B.
c.

”The earth is degenerating in
these latter days,” reads the one
cient stone slob. “There are signs
that the world is speedily coming
to an end. Bribery and corrup»
tion abound,

“The children no longer obey
their parents. Every man wants to
write a hook, and it is evident
that the end of the world is speed-
ily approaching."

Appointments to the business
staff of the Scarlet and Black were
announced today by Robert
Schutt, business manager of the

ert Whitley, and Mary Berge.

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

DORIC-

It is very meet and rlght that
before we begin the era of the new
Doric, a platform be tacked tar
,gethcr and placed in view of all,
as to the principles, policies and
moral standards of the editor.
First of all we shall try terrific-
ally hard to amuse and stimulate,
second, we shall strive to rush the
numerous institution fish-wives,
scandahmongers ond transom
packers at their own game, and
last but far from least, we shall
dish out the beauty in great qllanr
Lity With quality thrown in.

Smith hall, the home of the
brave, and thc brewing place
for many a jnolrpot, has

something now in the line ol

helligcrcms, The sheltered

freshmen—the pride and joy
of thc orientation course and
the nounory, hnvc taken the
siher spoons from their
mouths and rcbcllcd, “No

‘Hcll Week’ for us," they cry

ululc to go against the tide of
TRADITION?

Recently, after a good deal of
thought and discussion, Sam v. D.
Holch, divulged the solution to the
job hunt problem. Instead of ex-
porting all the goods to the cities,
why not import several carloads of
millionaires sons and daughters,
plan a Fiesta Week and hold is
Mate Hunt? The Public Relations
department could map out a cam-
paign that would guarantee at
least 50 per cent success. A week-
end of festivities including tea
dances, house parties and picnics
would not fail to bring a nominal
response and according to several
people, would take care of a large
majority of puzzled job seekers.

a r s
Tins stuff about ““‘oli‘t you

come up and sec my etchings"
has more truth cveu here in
couege . than a prospective
studon might believe. The im-
suspecting women who went
to the boil open houses dur-
ing the recent house parties
expecting to see oil paintings,
oruyou landscape drawings,
and portraits of family groups
hung up on the men‘s walls
were quite surprised. The boys
should hove veiled the Petty
drawings and etchings if only
for the chaperons.

nightiDickie lviooze, the Perfect
Lover, bouncing out of the door
with a date under one arm and his
brand new blanket under the

ing to stand up under the Wear

and he in a fit condition to see
him through his next season's
rush.
