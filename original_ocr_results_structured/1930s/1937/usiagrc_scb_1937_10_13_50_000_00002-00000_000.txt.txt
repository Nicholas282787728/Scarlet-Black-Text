A STEP FORWARD

When plans for a student Leader conference to discuss campus
problems were announced in this paper two weeks ago, we stated in
these columns our complete support of the plan, confident in the
belief that it was a step in the right direction and that the results

’ would be both concrete and beneficial.

Today, this paper carries the news that as a direct result of this
conference a student recreational center, to be known as the “White
House," is to become a reality. Also as a result of this conference
plans have been made looking toward a permane t fieldhouse and
student union, and to the expansion of college fac es for outdoor
recreation.

Our congratulations to John Spence, president of the Student
council, and those who have worked with him in developing these
plans. The committee on organization has a big job ahead which
should be completed in the shortest time consistent with careful
thought. We shall continue to support constructive activities such
as this and hope the student body will do the same.

THE STUDENT AND HIMSELF

Editor’s note; This is the ﬁrst in a series of editorials to appear
during succeeding issues of the Scarlet and Black concerning the
place of the individual student upon the campus and his relation to
the various aspects of college life,

‘4» s e

The student who comes to college expecting to have life continue
to be centered about himself as it is at home might just as well re»
turn home now.

It is beyond the bounds of mere absurdity for him to think that
in a group of some 800 people he might still remain so important.

Every student who plans to make a niche for himself in college
life must first of all be prepared to cooperate. COOPERATE—rthe
watchword in any group association.

He must be willing to do his part toward making his surround-
ings livable rather than waiting for a. roommate, a house chairman
or a dean to assume that task. It is not his place to expect a room-
mate to hand over the choicest side of the room to him, nor a house
chairman to keep him Supplied with dates. nor a dean to see that he
becomes adjusted to his companions

It is, rather. up to the individual student to approach college life,
~a life that he knows is hound to differ from the atmosphere of
home—with an opcnmindedness that will prepare him for all new ex-
periences.

He may know certainly that his home life will, in all probability
not have been the same as that of his roommate nor most of his other
companions. it null then behoove him to minimize that difference as
best he can by maintaining this same attitude or opchmindedness, ree
membering that there is always the possibility of another being right.

it is up to the individual to participate in college life if he ek—
pects to become a part of itiit Will never be possible for others to
do that participating for him.

rlatitudihous as it may be, it st_ill is true that no onlooker ever
gets half the fun or benefit from the work or game that is in process
that the participant docs.

G

“students today know that the educational system is phoney.
What they are getting is a mass of variegated and obsolescent infor-
mation which is tossed at them in an apparently unrelated form and
about which they do little if any thinking." The frank opinion of
Pres. Robcrt M. Hutchins of the University of Chicago.

 

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

DORIC ,

Permit us to say, in taking over
this column, that we are trying to
reform nothing, let alone the col-
umn itself. IL Will remain simple
and pure beauty, art for art’s
sake. We subscribe to no libel,
principally because it is seldom
funny. However, we warn all
that our attitude is armoral and
scientific. What We see we record.
Let the buyer beware!

lSchool an Idea
To Be Framed
by S’rudem"

Chicago, Ill. (acriﬁa univer~
sity is primarily an idea and the
responsibility for framing that
idea belongs to the student, Dr,
Franklyn Bliss Snyder, vice pres-
ident, told 1700 Northwestern
university freshmen, “If your idea
of a university pictures it as a
continuation of high school, where
you study ‘lessons' and take part
in ‘recitatlun.’ that is what the
university will be to you," he said.

“if you think of it as a collec-
tion of classrooms and laborae
tories where you spend all of
your time and energy in study,
denying to yourselves the oppor-
tunities for developing anyyphase
of your personality except the in-
tellectual, that again is what your
university will be to you.

“If you think of it as a train
ing ground for athletes and cheer
leaders. a seiies of lack-luster
days between contests in the sta—
dium and gymnasium, that again
it will be to you, and nothing
more.”

Dr. Snyder continued, “1 hope
yours (idea of a university) is
of a place of wider opportunities
than you have hither-to enjoyed;
of opportunities for work and
play, for learning and question-
ing, for living with interesting
people representing many parts of
the world and many attitudes to-
ward h'fe....for enjoying star—
light and sunshine and music and
art and other 'useless' things that
in the long run prove most useful
of all....for opening windows
into your minds. and for expos-
ing yourself to ideas."
