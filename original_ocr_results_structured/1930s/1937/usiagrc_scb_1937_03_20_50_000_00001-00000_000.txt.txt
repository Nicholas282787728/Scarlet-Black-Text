Second Floor Read
Claims “Going Steady”
Record of 70 Per Can!

A challenge to the socially
aspiring women of Grinnelll
Second tloor Read has hung up
a record of 70 per cent of its
residents “going steady" and
defies any other floor in school
to equal it, let alone surpass it.

Fourteen of the 20 inhabi—
tants ’ll'e devoting all their
time (theoretically) to one man
iaplece Only one of the men
lives out of town; the rest are
right here on hand
i And of the other six second-
rteadites, three at least have
been on the steady list at one
time or other during the year.

About that point in the writ-

brought up the idea that sec-
ond floor James iuiglit be a
close contestant for the record.
A quick clieck-np disclosed
that tlic challengers are still
ahead, {or the Jamesites have
only 03.5 per cent thoroughly
sewed up.

The remarkablc thing about
the Read situation is that all
but one oi the devoted women
are juniors or seniors, a blow
