Coach Plans
to Change
Cage Line-up

J.C.Truesdale Dissatisfied
with Forwardsy Play;
Seeks New Men

Thoroughly disgusted with the
lackadais‘cal, ”s t a n d around"
type of basketball the Pioneer
cage team has demonstrated in
the last several games, Coach
John ,C. Truesdale Tuesday inti-
mated that drastic changes in
the starting lineup might possibly
be made before the Washington
university tilt here Saturday
night.

Coach Truesdale is particularly
upset about the play of the for-
wards, who, he says, have com-
pletely failed to fulfill their func-
tions in recent games, especially
since the loss of Co-Captain Jim-
my LaMasiiey.

In a desperate attempt to in-
Ject a semblance of life and spirit
into the outfit, Truesdale said
there was a strong possibility
that Wrn. Fowler, senior guard,
and Harold High, sophomore util-
ity man, would find themselves at
the forward posts on Saturday
night. “Even though they may
not be as good basketball players
as some of the rest,” Truesdale
said, “They will he in there put-
ting up a scrap all the time. Both
of the men are ﬁghters."

No change was being contem-
plated in the guards, Truesdale
announced, but he did express a
wish for the improvement of that
play at center. “I am tired of
seeing this team playing ‘stand
around ball." Truesdale said. “In
spite of the fact that they won
two of their games on the road
trip,- they still put up pitifully
poor exhibitions in all the games

Bears Nose Out Pioneers
Saturday Night, 28-23

Trailing by only one point in the
last minute of play, the Pioneers
were unable to withstand a short
but effective scoring flurry in the
closing minutes of the game which
netted the Bears two points, and
cost Grinnell their fourth confer-

Rawson Takes

Cage Lead

Down Clark Teams Twice
Saturday Afternoon

By virtue of a double victory
over the league loading Clark hall
cagers, Rawson A and B teams as-
sumed first place in the annual in~
trainur-al basketball tournament
Saturday after-noon. Rawson A's
won 8 to 6, while the B aggrega-
tion came out on the long end of
a 13-10 count.

Other games played in the tour--
nament, saw Dibble and Smith
split in a double header- as the
Smith A team walked away with
an easy 20-9 victory, while the
Dibble B team evened the count
with a 26-13 victory over the
Smith B players.

Lorignn Wins

On Monday, Gates and Langan
made up a postponed contest, with
Langan wining 17-11. The Gates B
team had previously defeated the
Langan representatives 19-0 Sat-
urday morning. .

Ed Harvey paccd his Rawson
hallmates to victory in the A con-
test Saturday after-noon as he
looped iii the tying and winning
counter-s late in the contest. He
scored six of Rawson's eight
points. Scliritt, who did all of
Clark‘s scoring, kept his team in
the lead with three field goals un-
til the final minutes of play

The two B teams of the halls
staged a nip-and-tuck battle the
entire way before Rawson nosed
out a narrow victory as Arleigh
Holstad and Howard Lubbers
racked up six and four points re-
spectively. Lubbcrs dropped in a
bucket in the closing minutes of
play to give Rawson a lead. which
was later increased by a last min-
ute field goal by Holstad. Poor
hall handling and missed scoring
opportunities accounted for the
Clark defeat.

Smith, after trailing 5-4 at the
half, staged a late game spurt as
Phil Taylor tossed in seven buck-
ets to win the Dibble-Smith A
game Saturday afternoon. Led by
Charles Sheppard, who scored five
field goals, the Dibble B team
gained revenge for the A team
loss, downing the Smith B aggre-
gation 26-13.

Hangers, Hopes of Man
Discussed by Dr. Ame:

That man is able to find the
mainspring of this human life.
when he reaches a consciousness
that all creatures experience many
liuiigcrs and desires, was the con-
tention of Dr. Edward Scribner-
Ames, of the Universrty of Chica-
go Divinity school. He delivered
the introductory address “Hunger
and Hope" of the Gates Memorial
lectures Tuesday morning in Her-
rick chapel.

Dr. Amen pointed out that it is
only in man's own hunger and
thirst that he comes to a realiza-
tion of the hungers and thirst of
others,

> Three Ways to study

“The proper st'udy of mankind is
man," Dr. Ames declared and went
on to suggest three different ways
of viewing human life. “The first,"
he said, "was like looking at a
number of photographs of the
same individual in different moods
of Joy, sorrow, and foolishness."
Man is looking at himself on the

Carl Mernien
Beat Pioneers

Grinnell Defeated, 39-36,
in Dual Meet Monday

Shattering three pool and two
college records, in a closely cou-
tested battle, the Carleton college
swimmers Monday afternoon nosed
out the Pioneer tankmen in a dual
meet, 39-36,

Despite defeat in the last event,
the medley relay, the Grinnell mer-
nicn put up a sLubem fight all
the way in an cffolt to avenge two
defeats handed them by the Carla
last year.

Lose Second in Diving

Most paradoxical in the defeat
was the loss of second place in the
diving event by two-tenths of a
point, which gave Harry Liver-
more third place and Carleton’s
diver, Sharp, the coveted second
place. This loss of an event by a
traction of a point cost Cr-iniiell
the meet. as the Car-ls gained
three points for second place and
the Pioneers one point for third.
Had the scoring been reversed the
totals would have shown a one-
point victory for Grinnell, despite
the Carl victory in the medley,

In the medley relay, Grinnell
lost its chance to win the meet
when the Cai-ls won after overcom-
ing the five-yard lead that Mel-
gard, backstroker, gave his team
at the start.

Garbisch stars

Carleton's free-style ace, Dick
Garblsch, set a new record in the
220-yard free-style event when he
covered the distance in 2:232,
after swimming anchor man on
the Carl's 160~yard relay team
which lowered the pool record to
1:215. The Pioneer team in the
same event set a new college reo-
oi-d when they finished in 1:22. .

Erik Voss, repeating his i'ecol'd
smashing iii the 40-yard free-style,
which he started in the dual meet
with the Gustavus Adolphus swim-
mers last week, lowered his Own
mark to :193, both a now pool
and college iccord.
