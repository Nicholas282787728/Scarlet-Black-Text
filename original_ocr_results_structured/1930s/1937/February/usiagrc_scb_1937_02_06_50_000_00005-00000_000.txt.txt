5&3 Office Resembles Insane Asylum

in Final Minutes Before Deadline

Staff Works in Office

Downtown to Finish
Each Edition

By FRANCES G. HANSEN

(Editor's Note: This is the last‘

in a series of features explaining
the inside workings of the Scarlet
and Black J ‘

It's not an insane asylum, but
you'd think so when the Scarlet
and Black staff gets swmging
Wednesday and Saturday moi-n7
ings in their downtown office,
Speed is the main obJectic as
press time nears, and typewriters
clatter, the telephone rings furi-
ously, and presses rumble in the
background.

The downtown office is in a
basement room of The Grinnei'l
Herald-Register building on Fifth
avenue. Early in the morning of
press day, the managing etlitor
arrives to finish editing copy and
writing headlines left over from
the night before. The business
staff collects the last ads and lays
out the dummy, as described in the
last feature of the series.

rroof Comes Down

About 9:30 o'clock proofs begin
to come down from the composing
'l'ClOm. These are prints of one
long column of type, known as a
“galley” on a long, narrow strip
of paper, Edith Qualhei‘m, proof
editor, corrects mistakes and
sends the galleys back for correc-
tion. They are returned and cor»
reeted until the last mistake is
found.

By noon the paper is ready to
be made up Max w. Hunn, man-
aging editoi, is official typessling-
er. He places type in a “chase,"
an iron framework the size of two
pages of the paper, divided into
columns by narrow brass rules.

Linotype Machines

Eaeh line is a separate piece of
type metal, cast in the linotype
machine. Mr. Hum places die
stories, with their headlines, in
the spaces left after the ads have
been arranged. Hc reads the type
upside down and backward, the
orthodox newspaper fashion.

The headlines are “leaded," that
is, thin strips of lead are placed
between the lines of the heads to
separate them and make them
more legible. other leads are put
in wherever they are needed for
legibility or to make the story fit
the column.

Danger of “Pieillg"

The biggest bug-bear of a Com»
posing room is “pieing.” 1f fingers
slip or an elbow knocks into some
type, the lines in a story or the let-
ters in a headline are jumbled.
That's when a printer's ability to
read upside down and backwa‘ds

comes in liandiost in straightening
out the mess.

If there is time
type is in the column, a "stone
proof" is made. The printer
smears ink on the made-up pages
and places ovcr them a large sheet
of dampened paper. With a block
of wood and a mallet, ho pounds
the paper on the type, so that
pages are printed approximately
as they will appear in the final
issue.

Editor Checks

The editor runs ovcr tlic stone
proof for glaring errors. After they
are corrected, the forms of type
are sent down on an elevator to
the press room.

The Scarlet and Block is print-
ed on a flatbed press. which
prints four pages at a time, rath-
er than on a big, rotary press such
as you see in the movies. The edlr
tor grabs the first sheet which
comes off, and makes his last
check for mistakes.

"Let 'cr gal” is the signal that
cveiything is all right, the press
roars, and another issue of the
Scarlet and Black is on its way
to you.

Langan B Cagers,
19-0, This Morning

Turning in a feat rare in base
hall and seldom, if ever, heard of
in basketball, the Gates hall sags
ers defeated the Langan B team
19-0 in the third round games of
the intramural basketball toui‘nar
ment at the men's gym this morn
ing,

Langan was helpless and failed
to capitalize on any scoring oppor»
tunities, missing not only field
goals but all free throws attempt-
ed. The hapless Langanites
missed three frec throws which
might have kept them out of the
whitewash column,

Willard White led the Gates of-
fensive, racking up nine points on
four field goals and one free
throw. The balance of the scoring
was distributed among the other
players on the Gates team.

The Gates-Langan A game was
postponed this morning until later
in the season because of lack of
Langan players.

The box score follows;
