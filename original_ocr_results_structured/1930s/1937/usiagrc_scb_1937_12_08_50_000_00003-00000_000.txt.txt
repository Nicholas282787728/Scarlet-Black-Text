We present an editorial which
appeared in this Sunday's Des
Moines Register and Tribune:
GRINNELL QUlTS
THE CONFERENCE

Most of the member schools
or the Missouri Valley confer-
ence will read with regret the
decision of Grinnell to with
draw after next year. Also
they will respect the judgment
of Grinnell oificials.

Obviously the college has al—
ways been one of the smaller
ones of the conference, Its
normal malc enrollment, from
which to draw athletic mar
torial, has never been great
relatively. It has declined to
recruit competitively or to sub-
sidize its athletes.

Whether some of the more
ardent inns among Grillllttll's
alumni think this is an unduly
stmitrliwed position or not, it
emphasizes the fact that the
school‘s real luster among irid-
western institutions of higher
learning has sprung from schol-
astic excellence.

This is not a had peg, In-
cidentally, upon which to hang
one‘s future. After all, what
are colleges and universities
for?

1 That, in effect, summarizes our

own attitude on Grinnell’s with-
drawal from the conference.
Naturally, there has been con~
sideraole opposition to the move.
We believe, however, that most
thinking students will, in the end.
come to realize the long-term
wisdom of the move. And it is
significant that at least two var-
ls‘ity captains, and those in sports
’which have had far more confer-
,cnce success than has football,
lhave given their approval.

l The burning question now is:
Where will we go? The obvious
place, of course, is the Midwest
conference, and it is very likely
that we will eventually end just
there. It is understood that Pres.
J. s. Nollen is on very amicable
terms with the presidents of coe
and Carleton, both members of
the Midwest loop, and that in
the past few years that conference
has made it known that they
would like to have the Pioneers
among their number. Their meet-
ing and the results reported at
Chicago Sunday bear out that con-
clusion,

legiate SportSrWi'iters associar

olks take such things as No Draft Ventila-

cars have this improvement. But when you
add Knee»Action, the Unisteel Body, the
Turret Top, improved Hydraulic Brakes and
a steady parade of betterments~you see how
a great organization moves ahead—using its
resources for the beneﬁt of the public —

giving greater value as it wins greater sales.
