BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME

It was with a great deal of regret that we
learned of the unfortunate mishap which
halted Amelia Eorhal‘t’s projected flight
around the world just when she was leaving
Hawaii on the second lap of the journey.

According to reports her plane was not
completely demolished, and neither she nor
33y member of the crew of four were injul-
e .

She has determined to return to the
United States, repair her plane, and start
again.

It is unfortunate that a flight such as
hers, which might have contributed a great
deal to the mass of aeronautical experience
on long distance flying, should have failed
of completion. However, judging by what
we know of Miss Earhart, and by her in-
teresting personal appearance here last sem-
ester, we feel sure this mishap will not deter
her long from making this or 2. similar
flight. We know that the students of Grin‘
nell join us in wishing her ”better luck next
time," . J S

CAN USER’S TAX BE CONSTITUTIONAL

Representative Fred J. Keefe has intro—
duced a bill into the Iowa house of represen-
tatives providing that a 2 per cent tax he
collected by Iowa on any tangible personal
property purchased in another state by an
Iowan for use in this state: The article
must be valued at $20 or more. Within
30 days of the purchase, a record of such
must be filed with the board of assessment
and review on penalty of a fine of not more
than $5000 or imprisonment not exceeding a
year.

The tax would not be levied on articles on
which a sales tax of 2 per cent or more was
paid in another state.

Should the question of legality arise—
and it is highly possible that it will if the
bill is passed—the argument might pursue
several different lines,

In the first place, many now argue that
the thing is unconstitutional because of the
interstate commerce clause in the Federal
Constitution. This clause gives to the not-
ional Congress the right to regulate com-
m rce “among the several states." A par-

ular state’s right to regulate commerce

is defined as meaning control of that which
originates, ends, and has its entire course
within the boundaries of that state. Thus,
though the actual buying and selling may be
completed within the boundaries of another
state, the carrying of that article back into
Iowa is construed by some to give the trans-
action on interstate character.

Another Constitutional clause which is
said to provide difficulties is that which
says ”No state shall without the consent of
the Congress, lay any imposts or duties on
imports or exports except what may he ab-
solutely necessary for executing its inspecv
tion laws." Few, if any, would disagree
that the primary purpose of this law is not
to defray expenses of inspection.
press use is as a sort of equalizing fee for
those border-line merchants who charge
that they face unfair competition with mer-
chants of the states in which there is no
tax. Discounting the phrase, then, of the
tox's necessity, we have left the argument
that it is a tax on imports and here varying
definitions of the word “import” will again
scatter the debate.

A third possibility for controversy is the
clause which guarantees to the citizens of
one state that they will not be discriminat-
ed against by another stateithc personal
immunities clause. Thus, the upholders of
this argue that Iowa would be in fact dis-
criminating against the merchants of all-
other state by taxing the goods that those
people might sell to an Iowan.

It is interesting to note in conclusion that
the Washington state supreme court declar-
ed the principle behind this bill to be consti-
tutional while another bill of the same type
is now before the Federal Supreme CgurPt,

HITCH-HIKING

We see by the papers that the students
of several Iowa colleges are circulating pe-
titions to present to the state legislature
protesting against the proposed statute re—
stricting hitchhiking. We wonder if the
students are not going off halfccocked with—
out knowing what the law really intends to
do,

We would be the first to protest, if we
thought that the law would make it impos-
sible for college students to hitch-hike, but
the proposed law is not expected to do that.
Anyone who will inform himself on the pro-
visions of the law will realize that it is only
intended to keep the hitchchiker from be—
coming a menace on the streets. The
hitch-hike - who stays out of the street
while soliciting ides will be complying with
the law, and will pick up rides without ob-
structing traffic or endangering himself.

All of us have seen hitch-hikers who
stand in the street while waiting for rides,
blocking their side of the street so that on-
coming traffic had to detour to the wrong
side in order to pass, Those of us who
drive on the highways realize the dangers
which result from this.

We hope that Iowa college students will
get behind legislation such as this which is
not discriminating against them but which
will in reality help by eliminating a situor
tion which has caused much criticism of
hitch»hik.ing.

Other Opinions

“Vacations are a bad, thing. They make students
forget most. of what they know." Prof. Warner
Brown, chairman of the psychology department of
the University of California, contradicts findings
of two Oregon State college psychologists,

"I believe in a well-balanced academic commun-
ily, with proper arrangements for social life among
the students, the liberal element in education is
largely supplied indirectly." Hurvond university’s
Pres. Conant believes that special courses to pro-
vide training for citizenship or to make liberal
education available are unnecessary.

* A GUEST COLUMN.

It is with great fear and trem-
bllng that we take over the deli—
cate task of substituting our inkle
of talent for those of one, R, s.
McL. it seems as though said
McL, is becoming streamlined in
order to keep in character with the
new publication ”Zephyr” and has
no spare time on his hands to
struggle with this column of pure
beauty.

r a e
Speaking of pure bonuty,
the latest thing in competition
on this mum)“: is the contest
to select the “Queen” of the
college From mere observn,
tiou we would say that the

“Queen" will no the epitome of

the most popular type accord-

lug to the voting majority.

Whether she will he the deep

brown-eyed, tall, stately,

”lushy" variety or the rather

iuipertincnt, short but sweet

job lot. rennin-s to be seen.

Anyway they are already up

on the inspection board and

the wlnunh has a clunco to
run in the Drake relays or
something.

About 12 o‘clock last Saturday
eve the police officer at the city
hall (on duty, naturally) was dis-
till-bed by a frantic call from
someone living on the east side of
town. It seems this worried
townfolk was frightened by the
sight of two running figures, one
pulling the other. The other per-
son being hauled had a large band-
age over the upper portion of the
fees. That bandage was what got
the Witness. He admitted he told
this gruesome tale to the police
officer and added that it must
have been the finishing touch to a
blood»curdling accident. Imagine
the town gentleman’s confusion
when he found out that the two
walking corpses were merely two
league board members who had
strayed from the initiation party.
The member so tenderly enfolded
within the bandage was just a.
newly elect, while her sister-in-
leading was outgoing from office.
Sort of the example of “halt lead-
ing the blind."

McLeod is having trouble in
making the paper staff realize
that the expression ”the Zephyr

new Rock Island addition but the

baby Cyclone soon to blow over
the college.
