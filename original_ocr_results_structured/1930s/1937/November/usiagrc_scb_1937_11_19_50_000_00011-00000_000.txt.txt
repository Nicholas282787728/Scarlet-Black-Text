Vienna Choir Boys Termed ‘Happy
Choice’ to Open Music Course

Program, Presentation,

Musicianship Praised
by Huffman

By F. Walter Huffman.

A Grinneli audience of capacity
size was present Tuesday evening
to greet tho Vienna IClloir Boys
in the first program of the col-
lege concerl. series. A happier-
choice or an opening perform-
ance could not have been made.
Undoubtedly the pleasure afraid
ed by those young boys generatcd
an enthusiasm which will argue
well for greater interest in all
future musical presentations.
The choice of program and the
manner of presentation revealed
musicianship and training oi a
high order. Naturally the success
of the singers must be attributed
to their teachers and the disc'is
plino under which they work.
Tradition also plays a vital
part here, The establishment or
the court singers by Maximilian
I. in 1459, is the first step in the
hereditary succession which gives
us the Vienna Choir Boys of to-
day. To this devotion to a fine

tradition, add the sound training
of the Viennese musician and the
product is bound to be one but
little short of perfection.

it is impossible to descrihe the
hcauty of those young voices. They
possess a sweetness and [Taxi
ty 0! tone which is ravishing to
the ear, Nowhere was this more
effectively heard than in the SIX-
ccntury niotets which
seem ideally designed for such
quality. From the standpoint oi
shccr loveliness of singing, the
high point was reached in the
motets of callus and de Vittol's
nia, One does not have to leavc
the sixteenth century for the tin-
cst and purest writing in both the
secular and sacred styles.

The operette, “0n the Beautiful
Blue Danube," gave opportunity
for comedy and a new song stylc.
Frau Ssiiiier, Herr Heoht and
Mizzi performed with the artistry
of masters, We took particular
delight in the soul-stirring arias
of Mizzi and in the antics of
Herr Hecht!
