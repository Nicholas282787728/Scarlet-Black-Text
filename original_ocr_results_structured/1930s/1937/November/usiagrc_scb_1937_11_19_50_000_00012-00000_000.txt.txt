Ware Writes Again
Disputes First Grid Game.

First Forward Yass.
What Is A Billikell?

BY WELLS BARNETT

A few weeks ago, we printed a
squib praising Grinnell written by
Frederick Ware, sports editor of
the Omaha World-Herald. The
following piece appeared recently
as part of an answer to a. letter
of appreciation from Dean Shel-
ton Ll Beatty:

“Not just for its high academic
standards alone does one praise
Grinnell. As gxat is the respect
Grinnell commands for its ath-
letic' policy—the best team pos-
sible from the regular student
body; no packing of the student
body with subsidized athletic
meat; no desire to emulate Aaes-
op's fable 0! the lrog and the ox,
I hope that in the years to come,
Grinnell will be taken as an era
ample hy colleges seeking sanity

in athletics."

For the ﬁrst time in many
years, Grlnnell is meeting a team
at Homecoming which cannot by
any stretch of the imagination be
called a traditional rival, As a
matter of fact, the Pioneers and
the Billihens have met only three
times in the past 10 years. The
first game, in 1931, resulted in a
43-6 loss for Grinnell. In 1933
the Scarlet and Black lost 19-13,
and last year they were defeated
38-6.

Incidentallyfst. Louis is the
only school which disputes Grin-
nell's claim of having played the
first intercollegiate football game
west of the Mississippi. Grinneil
defeated Iowa at Grinnell in 1889

to claim that distinction. How-
ever, the first game St. Louis
played, while it occurred in 1388,
was played at Smith college in
illinois.

The Billikens also claim at least
partial paternity of the present
day ‘forward pass. In 1907 st.
Louis, under the tutelage of Eddie
cochems, faced a suicide schedule.
However, Coach Cochems and his
players discovered that by holding
the football on its shortest axis.
they could get distance far ex-
ceeding that with the basketball
throw.

In answer to a question which
has bothered us for some time
past, the st. Louis publicity de-
partment forwards the following
vital information:
\VIIAT Is A BILLIKEN?
What is a Billiken and how
did the grotesque-looking fi-
gure become associated with
the so Louis University grid-
iron?
During the [all of 1910, the
strange-looking creature, re-

Loading the st Louis university
team in its inr ion of Grinnell

ball coach and athletic director,

(presenting the god of things
as they should be, was the
rage of the country, Gil-ls
wore miniature Biliikens on

 

the Sir Louis university grid-
fellows sported Billiken wntch
labs.

One attemoon a cartoon of
a Billihen was lclt thumb-
tacked on the front door of
Gunll's Drug store, located
then at Grand and Inclede
boulevards. Beneath it was
written “Coach Bender." The
author of it, Charley Mc—
Namara, got the idea from
the st. Louis coach John Ben-
der, known in “Meantime” to
his fl‘iendsl

Bonder had such a roly-
poly face that every time he
smiled his bnloon cheeks coin-
pletely covered his squinty
eyes: During practice one
day the tciun ran off its
plays with a gusto that was
particularly pleasing, and cor—
toonist McNamara got his
Billihen idea by watching
Bender repeatedly resemble.

O'Conner, Post-Dispatch
sports writer, saw Bender’s
eat one day and exclaimed,
