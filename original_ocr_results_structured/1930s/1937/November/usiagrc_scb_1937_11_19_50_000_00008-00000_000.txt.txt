National Survey
Shows Chemistry
Most Difficult

What )5 the most. difficult col-
lege subject?

Organic chemistry.

This is revealed in a study
made by the bureau of educa-
tional surveys, New York City.

The bureau found that the use
of supplementary aids to study
was in direct proportion to diffi-
culty in the subject experienced
by the student, and that the num-
ber of students in organic chem-
istry using these aids far ex-
Lceedcd that of any other course.

According to the study, science
courses as a group are a major
source of difficulty, with history,
particularly ancient, medieval and
European not far behind. Study
of Shakespeare's plays rates
“hardest" of the English liters.-
ture coursesi

The subjects most baffling to
students, in order of their diffi-

ton.

Injuries will be the Pioneers'
worst menace tomorrow. ,After
coming to the end of a season
marked by as few bad injuries as
in any recent season, the Grin»
nell team faces the loss of Bill
Sampson. three year veteran at
halfback, who is laid up with an
infected foot.

Sampson's loss will he felt very
kccnly, for he is regarded as
about as capable and dependable
a boy as can be found on the
squad. There is a faint possibility
that he may get to play even yet,
but it is very faint indced. In
addition, Jack Osborn, senior

guard, is definitely out with an—‘

other sprained ankle, and Burke
Powers will be kept out except in
emergencies with a broken hand.

Practicc program for the weekl

has consisted mainly of rest. No
practices at all were held Monday
and Tuesday, and the work Wede
ncsday, Thursday and tonight
was light, and included no contact
work at all. diookabaugh's main
problem has been to keep the
boys ready with their plays well
in mind and to give them an idea
of st, tLouis' style of play.

The Billikcns will presentto the
homecomers a strong, well-bah
anced team with an impressive
record. Scouts say that their
running attack is about as pow—
erful as Creighton'a, but that
they have a much stronger pass-
ing attack and a brilliant defense.
Most of their plays are run from
