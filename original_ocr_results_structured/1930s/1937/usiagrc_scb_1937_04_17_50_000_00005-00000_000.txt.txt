Notes on
Collegiate World

Lipel‘ougc second-handvt h a t s
the only way University of Wis-
cousin men will smear it on.

“There can he hardly any doubt
about the fate or potential lip-
stick users at Wisconsin." said one
student, “They would be hooted en
masse.”

It used to be the clock-watcher
who was proddc to work with both
eyes on his task, Now the clock—l
unwatcher is being warned,

If you become so engrossed ini
doing- a theme or any other kind;
of work that you skip meals and:
glances at a timepiece, you may
be headed for one or two thingsi
gcniusdom or a padded cell.

so says Prof, G. D, Higginson,
of the psychology department at

the University of Illinois.

It is a well known fact, explains
the professor, that there isn't
mucll difference between a genius

.and an insane person. Both have

intense powers of concentration
for a certain subject. But a genius
can think of other things when he
trics: an insane person can’t.

Sit-down strikes can be traced
back to Jonah, the biblical char-V
acter who was swallowed by the
whale At least that's what a
writer in the Michigan Daily
proves from the scriptures.

Jonah didn't belong to the C10,
nor was be troubled with labor dir.
riculties. He was displeased bee
cause his prophecy that Nineveh
would [all because at its iniquitles
didn't materialize.

“But it displeaseth Jonah ex-.
cee .ngly, and he was angry."
(Jonah 4:1), “Then Jonah went
out of the city and sat on the east
side of the city, and there made
him a booth, and sat under it in
the shadow, till he might see what

would become of the city."
