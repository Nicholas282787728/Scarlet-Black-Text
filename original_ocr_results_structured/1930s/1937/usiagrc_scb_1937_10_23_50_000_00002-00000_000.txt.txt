THE SECOND SPEECH

The seventh Annual Grinnell Student Conference on International
Relations will close tonight With Morgan Jones‘ address in Herrick
Chapel. This year's meeting has set a real goal for future con-
ferences, and the executive committee is to be congratulated upon
its notable success.

One of the most interesting lectures at this conference was
given in the chapel yesterday afternoon by Gifford Ernest. Erncst,
who is a student of Soviet Russia, has spent more than a year
abroad studying communism and is well qualified to speak on
“Soviet Russia_a Challenge,” His interest in his subject and the
sincereity of his presentation lcd many of the audience to the mis-
taken idea that he is a communist. Far from it: To successfully
combat a system such as Communism one must thoroughly under
stand that system and Ernest’s clear analysis of the U. S. S. R. only
brought closer to home to us that the Communistic way presents
a real and living challenge to Democracy, world peace and world
progress Ernest is not a communist to any in any sense of the
word, except it be to those who would say that to know Communism
is to be a Communist. He was merely giving the communistic
answer to the age old problem of government, and surely if we
ignore the answer of a country of 147,000,00000 people, antagonisticale
ly minded to capitalism is that not inviting the destruction of
cpaatnlism by that country? Many of the students did not like his
address because they did not agree with it. Too many of us, when
the Soviet Union is mentioned, throw up our hands and refuse to
hear anything more about it unless it be a bombast against it. To
the majority of Grinnellians, Ernest presented a new interpretation
of Communism and as such it was one of the most educational
speeches given on the Grinncll campus in a long while.

THEY ARE GONE Gi—

Any comment on such a tragic event as the collision between
the Rocket and a school bus near Mason City which resulted in the
death of nine and the serious injury of 20, is in the nature of locking
the barn door after the horse is stolen.

It is of course too early to pass judgement on responssibility for
theaccident. Reports indicate that the vision of engineer and bus
driver, though both were going slowly, was obstructed by a pile of
tiles near the intersection. Placing responsibility for this state of
affairs will not, however, bring back those lives. They are gone.
To those they leave behind, our sympathy.

SHED A TEAR G

The soecalled “tough" criminal type pictured by the movies and
the newspapers is at heart an ”old softy,” according to Dr. Franz
Alexander, who has psycoanalyzed thousands of criminals in this
country and Europe.

According to the doctor the American criminal suffers from
an inferiority complex. He acts tough to cover up his innate soft-
ness.

We kinda feel sorry for the poor abused crook. Misunderstood
and prosecuted by society, he goes his way hiding hls kind heart
behind a bluff cruel exterior.

We really don’t know what to suggest to help these beiughtcd
individuals. Perhaps the government could furnish them an up to
date happy hunting ground in which they could rob each other
openly and thus get back their self respect.

Or perhaps we shall just shed a quiet tear and let the matter

 

go.
