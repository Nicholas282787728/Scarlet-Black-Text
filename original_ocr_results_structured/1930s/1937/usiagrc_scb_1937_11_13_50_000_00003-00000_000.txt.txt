The Ice Box
That’s ,a
“Life Box”

To a certain ice box in our
prescription department come
doctors, their assistants, and
nurses Theirs is a serious mis
sion, for in its frigid depths are
no meats and puddings, but
priceless scrums and vaccines.

HEN a vicious disease

threatens, or a hospital cot
holds a feverish stricken being,
from this box come little vials
that bring new life and hope.
Many a person in Grinnell owes
his lift to this guardian of
health. Surely it deserves to
he called “the ice box that's a
lite box.”
