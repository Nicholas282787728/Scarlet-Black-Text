AN OPPORTUNITY F011 DIPT!O\'E)I‘EFT

lEditorial Board chairman's note This is the sixth in the series
of editorials on student government sponsored by the Editorial
Board.)

During the past few weeks the Scarlet and Black has carried
stories of elections of new officers of various camptis activities, and
of additions to club member-ship rolls,

It is to be hoped that these new members and officials accept
their jobs with no mere happy thankfullless for the honor. but rather
that they see clearly the numerous details involved in making their
particular groups vigorous, efficient parts of campus life. Traditional
rules and customs are well worth the serious consideration of each
new person in a post. These, however, must be tempered with inno-
vations. No organization is worth its salt which sits back on its
heels and sighs complacently, “The class of ‘93 started this particular
plan. We might Just as well continue."

Having been elected some three or four months before many will
assume actual executive duties, it is up to these new officers to make
use of the intervening period for learning routine work as well as
using their own ingenuity to plan changes.

Make your organizations worthy of listing as prominent college
groups meriting the serious attention of all students and actpiain-

tances of the college.
THE EDITORIAL BOARD.

PEACE DAY

Tomorrow morning nearly a million college students all over the
country will join in mass demonstrations in the interests of peace
All sorts of plans are being made at various institutions, but they are
all primarily spontaneous expressions of the attitude of college stue
dents toward war and peace. We on this campus will have an oppor-
tunity to participate in these demonstrations, through our chapel
program tomorrow morning, and a mass meeting in the evening.

It is to be hoped that Gl-innell students will express their convic-
tions against war. and for a real peace program by joining in the
demonstrations planned for this occasion. No observer can miss the
significance of such a move when it is multiplied by hundreds of
colleges and universities all over the country, Tomorrow is the day
for all of us who are interested in peace to show the world how we
feel. 7.1. 3.

Group Handling Proves
More Effective Than
Individual Hunts

The 18 Grinnell seniors who jour-

neyed to Des Moines last Thursday
and Friday came back with a good
deal of joll hunting experience hilt
with few promised jobs.
Theodore Thomas, personnel (II'
rector and supervisor ot employ
ment iii the college, said, “The
seniors felt reasonably encouraged
over the results of the trip. Nate

did, due to the fact that the turn:

ed by Harris Coggcshall, attorney,

during their stay in the city, ac-
cording to W. R, Booi-man, asses
crate professor of sociology, who
accompanied the students to Des
Moines.

"Handling the job hunt on a
group basis is more effective than
individually conducted 10b hunts,

 

One senior who participated in
the Chicago as well as the Des
Moines job hunt, characterized the
difference between the two cities
by saying that in Chicago an em-
ployer wants a student with a
broad background, Later the em-
ployer expects to give the student
special training. In Des Moines
the aver-age employer wants a
more specialized employee, and
expects him to take over a posi-
tion without further- tr iirg.

Some of the students said they
wore handicapped because of their
lack of knowledge about office
machinery.
