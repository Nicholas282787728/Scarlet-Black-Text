POLITICAL BOSSES AND EDUCATION

Today began the “trial” of Pres. Glen Frank of the
University of Wisconsin. Whether Frank will be ousted
because of what his fliends declare to be his political
disagreements with Gov. LaFollette will not be decided
for another week. ,

Meanwhile, it calls to attention the ever-present
problem of whether state-financed schools shall be the
playthings of political bosses.

School systems are for the education of the nation’s
people~the unbiased, disinterested education of these
patrons The faculties are occupied with researches for
laws whose truths are indubitable even though revolu-
tionary. It is no more right that some governmental
office-holder should suppress or “ballyhoo” the discovery
of such laws than it is that courts of justice should be
administered by the leaders of gangland

Oil the other side of the question is the possibility
of professors, aided by the security and prestige of high
positions and degrees, may declaim the merits of narrow,
personal .views on varied subjects.

It is highly probable that blame for inefficiency in
our whole educational system exists on both sides; yet
the political-boss danger is perhaps more imminent or
may be only more publicized.

At any rate, if politicians are to rule our educational
media and dictate just how much shall be taught, then
deliver lls from attendance at such institutions. P

CANADA’S WELCOME ATTITUDE

In a world that is threatened by many possibilities
of war, one of the most encouraging- outlooks for believ-
ers in peace is Canada‘s new sense of responsibility to
ward world affairs, as revealed by her attitude towards
the recent PaneAInerican Peace Conference. Hitherto.
Canada’s policy toward any American “league of nations”
has been one of complete indifferenc. The reason, of
course, has been that Canada has felt that Great Britain
and the British empire deserved all her allegience and
support.

It is highly interesting to note the change in Cana-
da’s viewpoint since the end of the PalerInerican con
ference; for now this province is asking why it shollld
not assume the role of interpreter and good-will advocate
between the whole of the western hemisphere and the
British people Incidentally, the result'of such unity
would he better 'ade relations with South and Central
American count esiand such improvement is strongly
desired in government circles. Canada feels, also, that
with the growing ranks of Communism and Fascism,
there is a great need for a closer alliance between all
free peoples and she believes that two continents united
for peace must assert a strong influence towards world
sanity.

In short, Canada is ready to endorse officially the
avowed object of the Pan»American conferences, and it is
only waiting a formal invitation to join the American
“league of nations." Peace advocates are highly encour—
aged by Canada‘s willingness to co—operate with the other
American countries in striving for world peace, and they
believe a step has been taken that will have decided
effects in maintaining peace. iALlB.
