By WELLS BARIiETT
This week coach John Truosdale
has been wishing that the New
Year would biing Grinnell athlet-
ics a change of luck from the ill
fortune of last year. Thursday
his prayers began to be answered.
when it was announced that Ver-
non Cornish. one of the junior Cola
lege boys from Chicago, had re-
ceived his diploma from his school.
and was eligible immediately for
varsity competition.
a , i
in case anyone has been
wondering why all the shout-
ing about Cornish, it might
be a good idea to give a few
salient facts about him, the
ﬁrst of which is that he is
one of the most capable cen-
ters in the school. lie stands
Slx toot, three inchui in height,
and weighs in the neighbor-

hood of 200 pounds.
a a i.

He has two main attributes, one
an ability to drop in the buckets
with a peculiar flip of the wrist
from above his head. At first
people watching him drop those
shots thought he was lucky, but
he made so many of them they
finally had to admit he was just
good.

coo

His second main attribute is
an ability to handle the bail
in the hole without getting
tied up, which means that he
has a better than average
chance of getting a shot or
passing than a center who
lets himself get tied up all the
time.

t >3 .-

The addition of‘Cornish to the
squad will have two very good of:
fccts, It will provide Liiick with
a capable reserve, who will be
able to carry the burden at eerie
ter without slowing up the team,
and it will mean that Bob Berry
will be able to concentrate on
guard, his best position, and for-
get about playing center when a
reserve to that position is needed.

 

ticiilt [or a man as hirge mid
heai-y as he to carry that
weight for l). tidi game with-
out tiring to a certain e
tent. Cornish helps to solve
that problem. Berry, a g‘uttrzi
by all indications ol' aptitude
and ti-ni lug, has hm] up until
now, to pln~ lvolli center and

So that's why Tiuesdaic is be-}

ginning to cheer up after beingl
pretty gloomy over the bad start‘i
the cagers had this year. Ans
other cheering note is the fact
that Lllick's sprained ankle, sus-:
tamed in practice Thursday. isn’t
as bad as it could be, and proo
ably won't prevent his playing [Or
