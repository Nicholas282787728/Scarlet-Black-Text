Pioneer trackmen will open
their indoor track season Thurs
day night at Iowa City when

Tulsa Friday

Third Straight Win

Riding the crest of their home
court winning streak, the Pioneer
cagers will engage the once-proud
Tulsa. Hurricanes in the gym of
the leaky roof next Friday eve-
hing.

With Luick, Dean and Conwill
wearing their shooting togs,
Truesdales squad should have lit—
tle trouble with the Hurricanes,
who were defeated 31-23 on the
last lap of the southem trip. The
Tulsans, who had been rated one
of the title contenders in pressed
son dope, felt the sting of the
demon ineligibility when the se-
mester grades came out.

Stars out

The Hurricanes’ hopes were
ruined the very day the Pioneers
played in Tulsa, when it was an-
nounced the afternoon before
the game, that Butler and Jones.
star forwards and high powered
scorers, would be unable to come
pete,

since Butler and Jones lcit the
squad the Tulsans have been un-
able to find a scoring punch.

Regular Lineeup

Grinnell's regular starting line-
up will probably take the floor
Friday evening. Bill, “Spider” Cone
will and John Hayward will man
the forward posts. Wilbur Luick,
giant rcdhead, will jump at center
with Hal Dean, the team's leading
scorer. and Bob Berry will hold
down the guard stations.
