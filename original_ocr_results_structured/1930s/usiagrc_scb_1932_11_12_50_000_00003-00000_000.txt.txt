fighting from ondemeath in this
week's battle.

A‘ newlyrdiscovered backfield acc.
“lefty” Weger, and the development
of several reserves have given Butler
the strongest squad of the season de-
spite the loss of regulars by injuries
Weger has added both speed and ver-
satility to the ballrcarrylllg depart-
ment of the squad. Eight seniors will
don varsity uniforms for the final
time.

The Dayton game gives Butler a
chance to finish the season on an
even basis. Three defeats, two victor-
ies, and a tie have been recorded
against major competition. Dayton
brings a highly-touted aggregation
to oppose the Hoosier rival. Last
