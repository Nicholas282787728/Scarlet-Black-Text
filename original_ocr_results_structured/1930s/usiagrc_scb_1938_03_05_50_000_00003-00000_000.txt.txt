WANTED

Qualified Male Entries
in Zephyr Contest

It would seem that there is
a paucity of Srinnell men of
high enough calihre, qualified
to spend a weekend as guests
at a girls' school, if the return
oi ballots in the Zephyr poll
is any indication of the student
mind,

According to Fay Jackson,
editor of the campus maga-
zinr. no eligible men have been
submitted. He would not haz—
ard a guess as to whether this
condition is to he attributed to
a dearth of talent or a desire
of the girls to keep the boys
on the campus.

Deadline for entries is March
15, and choices are to be put
in the postoffice box or the
Zephyr in the book store, ac-
cording to Jackson.
