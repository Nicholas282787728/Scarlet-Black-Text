A TEMPORARY LOSS

Fifty years ago an illlllligrant hey came
to America from Aust in-IIungllry—iln llllmlr
grant hay who was destined to llecoluo our of
the outstanding educators in the United States.

Last night (trinnell college paid homage to
this “immigrant boy,” Dr. Edward Alfred
Steiner. irinnell students and faculty
paused to celebrate the 50th anniversary at
Dr. Steiner‘s life in nmcric ’l‘hoy paused
to consider the miraculous lsc of this poor
boy to a place of eminence, among the greatest
of living Americans.

Dr. Steiner will not ho serving Grinnoll
oollege in the class room thi. unestcr, hut he
will be, scrxing (ll-innell nnd Ills adopted coun-
try by u-ritiug the autobiography of his hit,
ual life as an American. He will he Scr illg
trinllell and his adoptcd rouutn by showing
us the oppol-tulli s to which many at us are
blind.

As the second semester llogins. wo‘como
to the ho ll realization, that one of our
greatest Dlipol’flliii , at (ll inelli\\'0|'l\' \llltlt‘t'
Dr. Stcillor—‘s temporarll gone. We are
recognizing tll distint‘t loqs; yet we real .0
that the account of llls spiritual life in .\lucrlr
will prove to be a rillunllle book.

And now, on the part of the students and
faculty melnllers ot Griuuoll mllege, may we,
wish him good luck. J. N.

A SLIGHT Enlion

We wish to call attention to an error which
occu--ed in an editorial cntitled “UselESs Actlon”
which appeared in the Jan, 13 issue oi the SCARr
LET AND BLACK.

Thc editorial statcd that JnsLicc Brandeis of
the United StatEs Suplemc court was appointed by
President. Coolidge. Brandeis was appointed by
President Wilson in 1916 President Coolidge up

We are sorry for this error.

Other Opinions

Sociologists, physicians, mental experts, ps
chologlsts and criminoligists have all ddvanced‘tlles
ories as to why we have clinic . And yet none of
them hcvc struck at the heart. of the luatLerrra
theory so obvious that it is perhaps overlooked for
that reason. Why not blame the spread of crimei
the desire for “easy money”—on the jury system?

Here is all allegorical analysis of the situatio '

when your automobile fails to function, you
fake it. to n mechanic. He has the proper equipment
to repair the defect. When you want to purchase
food, you go to a glccery store. where complete
stocks of all food supplies are kept for sclc Yet, if
you have a matter in the courts that; involves cal
ful and dispassionate balancing of testimony and
observation. you hire compelled to accept the sec
vices of the first 12 men or women who convince the
court that they are chiefly remarkable for what
they don't know about the matter at hand. What
could be more ludicrous, illogical or impractical?

It is because of “HS antiquated jury system
that rackets. graft. and oIlL—anrlrout. crlmc have paid
in the United States, Personal gain, not mental
wcsknes. is the motive the average criminal today
is taking less than u o -50 chance, If hc is found
out, he may lose; if he is not found out, he wins.
And when he takes this chance he is only following
the racial characteristics of the native American.

Abolish the present impossible method of select
lug .nc men who sit in judgment upon the criminal
and you abolish the crime wave, which doesn't. to rc-
pcot the old adage, payiif you're caught.

PH! BABBIT KAPPA
(Washington Student Life)

Apparently bored with the philosophical sud
scientific erudition of “The American Scsolar," the
United chapters of Phi Beta Kappa have how
undertaken the publication ot “The Key Reporter."
This little magazine, according to an editorial
,therein, has as its cardinal aim the dissipation of
“the occasional mistaken impression that Phi .Bctn
Kappc is doing nothing.”

The leading article in “The Key Reporter" is a
quite interesting discussion of what constitutes the
Phi Beta hcndclcsp and how Mr. Bert C. Farrar, for
47 years chief of the Documents Examination Divlsr
ion of, the United State Treasury department,
recently used the infra-red my in on attempt. to
solve the mystey of its origin. ‘

“Boytd Battles Recta," the longest single article
in the magazine, is a report on a tour of investiga—
tion through numerous dictionaries, cucyclopcdics,
Greek text. hooks. and high school English class
themes; the purpose of said tour being to discover
how to pronounce Phi Beta Kappa.

Finally, sandwiched in among a lot. of little
cnssys about Phi Betas being the best people on
earth, physically and mentally. comes a picture of
the tombstone of Edward Young Gould, Yale 1342.
Mr. Gould's tombstone has c Phi Bete key chiseled
prominently on its face, to show that even in death,
he is proud of his membership,

Even Phi Beta Kappa, is seems, has gonc in for
Bobbirism,
