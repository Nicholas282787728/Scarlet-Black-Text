SATURDAY FEBRUARY 7, 1931.

m Column cl rm mm.

Far more unique and far more ef-
fective than the usual run of dancing,
polesitting, and cross country en—
durance contests have been the set
of marathons sponsored the last two
weeks by the college faculty. Since
the endurance contests were comr
pulsory, only a few hardy constitu—
tions have survived the haul’s DI
grilling. The rest of us are left
physical wrecks.

D1050 of the judges seemed to lmve
survived nicely, but we are only
waiting to see the result when they
have read the thousands upon thous—
minds of blue books ﬁlled .Wiih illeg-
ible scrawling. “l0 venture that “10
second marathon will bring the some

brilliant results as did the ﬁrst.

\V’th breathless anticipation we

await the survivor.

once there was a little girl. She
wrote a poem. It was all about her
"big boy” from the East; When
we read it in the Doric, we kinda
,got the idea that she kinda liked
him kinda quitea bit.

Then this big brawny lad went to
the hospital. He had his tonsils and
adenoids hauled. She, being anxious
about his health and the beauty of
the nurses, went out to see him. He,
thinking that she cared, asked her
to sooth his absent tonsils by rubbing
his back—and, what do you think?
She up and turned him down list:

“Women are funny," as Aesop once
said at a convention of hardware

merchants.

And, speaking of hospitals, Mc-
Ilrath, not to be outdone by Dick,
went out there, too, and they put
him in a crazy room:

That wasn‘t so bad: But now
we've heard that Jimmy Morrison
has been out: there thrice (a), and
they've put him in there every

tune.

We don't think Professor Charlton
liked the ofﬁcials we had for the
Oklahoma Aggie-Grinnell basketball
game. He says that he caught the
visitors offside several times at the
tip-off, and the ref or ump never

once penalized them.

Coach “Johnny" Truesdale got
a big band when he made his ap<
pan-ante on the floor at Milwau-
kee, Wis. to “work" the Creigh-
monstxquette basketball game.
It seems theﬂilltopstudents had
never seen the gorgeous striped
blazer used in the Missouri Valley
conference before, and they got a
large .whee out of it:

“Meet You
There at 6”

The rendezvous of those
who enjoy informal atmos-
phere and fed prepared as
they like it.

Gyinnell Cugers Will Play
Marquette Quintet Tonight

Coach John Truesdale left yesters
day noon with 10 members of the
varsity basketball squad for Mil—
waukee, Wis., where the Pioneers
play the Marquette quintet this eve-
ning.

Frank Duncan and Richard Ullrich
will probably start the game at the
forward positions, with Carleton
Humphrey at center, and Ben Dongs
las and Dewitt McCreary at guards,
Capt. Russell Ruff, who is still both—
ered slightly by a knee injury receiv-
ed last fall on the gridiron, will
doubtless see action.

Trackmen Race
Mates to Place
on Indoor Team
Final trials were held this morning
in the men's gymnasium to decide the

men that will make up this year's
Grinnell indoor track team. The

|squad was divided into two groups

for competitive running.

Captain Howard Mcllrath
was the captain of one team,
which Richard Murphy led the
other. Both of these veterans are
recovering from minor operations.
and will not be in top shape for the
Grinnell-Drakc dual meet in Des
Moincs next Saturday. '

Other track men have been work»
ing out regularly since Christmas
vacation, and, according to Coach
Lester Duke, are in shape to meet the
Bulldogs.

Charles BureS is developing fast
into a good distance man, so that
with Walter Secor, Huburt Pye, Wy-
man Gerhardt, Myron Pilblow, and
McIlrath, the Fioneers will have lit—
tle to fear in the distance events.

Burton Holmes is improving stead-
ily in the shorter runs, and Frank
Spangler is showing promise of being
an asset to the team.
