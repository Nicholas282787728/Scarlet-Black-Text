THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Sf. Louis University Founded in 1818;
MissouriAddedto Union 3 Years Later

Granted Charter in 1833;

Grinnell Organized
15 Years After

Grinnell college is not, as is gen-
ci-ally believed on the local campus,
the oldest college west of the Miss
issippi river, according to word rc-
ceived by The Scarlet and Black
from Louis J. Kramp, editor of the

Alumni News N. St. Louis university, -

St. Louis.

The foundation of st, Louis unis
versity, according to him dates back
to 1818, three years before Missouri
hecamc a state of the union. Grin
nell was founded as Iowa college in
1848, so years later

Founded in 1818

St. Louis university was known as
St Louis academy in 1818 and two
year-s later it became St. Louis coir
lege. In 1832 it received a charter as
St. Louis university from the State
and at no time has its work been
interrupted

The first academic degrees were
bestowed by St Louis coilege in 1822
while Gi'innell graduated two stllr
dents in 1554. st. Louis
conferred the degree of mn='-‘ of
arts in 1534, Its college or mcdi no
was establishel in 1836, its college
of law in 1842, and its school of di-
vinity in 1844

Both ins wrong

Today, the institution has an en-
rollment of approximately 6,000 stu-
dents in all of its departments.

Iowa Wesleyan college and Grins
nell college were hoth claiming the
title of the oldest college west of
the Mississippi this year. Through

‘ this

university 3

information received by The
Scarlet and Black, it appears that
neither can rightfully claim the dis—
tinction.

coeducational college west of the
Mississippi, however, the first woman
graduating here in 1865.
