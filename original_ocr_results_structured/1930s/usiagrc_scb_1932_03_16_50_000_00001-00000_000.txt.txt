Pianist Plays
for Audience
as Personality

Critic Contrasts Goldsand
With Paderewski

in Review

By H. w. MATLACK

In these days when superb tecllnic~
al ability is acquired in the pianists'
"kindel-gartens, it is no longer suffic—
ient to measure virtuosity simply in
terms of brilliant performance, What
we ask is, does this pianist have any
thing to say? Anybody may acquire
a vocabulary. Very few are able to
make new or striking use of it.

Robert Goldsand speaks not merely
as one more character in the proces-
sion of astonishingly brilliant pianists,
but as a personality. He is of course
a very young musician, still self-con-
scious and not altogether free from
anxiety. It is helpful to contrast him
with Paderewski, whom many of us
heard a few days before. More than
half a century of artistic experience
separates the two.

All Lies Ahead

Paderewski has sounded the heights
and depths of a public career. Long
ago he passed the limits of technical
perfection, and it means nothing to
him. He has many times traversed
all the highways of the realm of tone.
there is nothing new in it for him.
It seems to he an effort for him even
to recall how exciting and romantic
it used to he.

But with Goldsand everything is
su‘ll ahead. How will he take it?
Does he feel the same passionate
glamour in piano music that Pader-
ewski felt so years ago? Will he he

pages of Chopin and Mozart into the‘

tender melting tones which years ago

Iowa Mentor Here Once

”The best man for the job," is
Coach Lester L. (Fuzz) Watt's view
on the selection of Ossie Solem, f0l~
mcr Drake grid mentor, for the pc.
tioii of head football coach at the
University of Iowa,

“The Grinnell coaching staff is
sorry to see Solcm leave Drake and
the Missouri Valley circuit, but at
the same time we congratulate him
on his advancement," declared Coach
John C. Truesdale.

Coach Watt, who knew Solcin both
as a fair-minded opponent and by
some personal contact at the time
when the new Iowa leader was $3117
ed to coach Grinnclrs football teams,
believes that Coach Solem will den
velop fast, deceptive teams, with
emphasis on wealcside plays.

Solem's contract to coach at Grin-
neil was signed in 1917. He came
hero for a short time that spring,
Watt, incidentally, working out sew
oral afternoons in spring football
practice, under his tutelage. During
the summer, however, Solem was
, called for army service and was forc—
ed to break his contract.

Pilbrow Ranks
Among Stellar

Distance Men

Victory Ov‘elr Chamberlain,
Michigan State Star;
Upset of Season

1n the footsteps of Leonard Paulu
and Morgan Taylor, Grinncll track
champions of days gone by, Myron
Pilbrow, crack Pioneer two-miler. ac-
counted for the greatest upset of the
current indoor track season, when he
made a brilliant finish to defeat
Clark Chamberlain, Michigan state's
world-champion cross country star,
in the two mile run at the central
Intercollegiate meet in south Bend
Saturday.

The little Pioneer runner’s
time of 9:242 tied the confcrence
record, and is nearly 15 seconds fast-
er than his prcvious time.

The Crinnell team accounted for
eight points which gave it seventh
place in the final rankings, a fraction
of a point behind Drake. Notre Dame
took first place by a close margin,
nosing out Michigan Normal. Mar-
quette, Kansas State Teachers, and
Michigan State followed in the order
named.

Pillirow Advances

Chamberlain, proclaimed to be one
of the best distance runners that ever
set foot on an American track, was
out to lower the national collegiate
record, and had everything his own
way for the first mile. At that time.
he was almost 100 yards ahead of
Pilhrow. The diminutive Crinnell star
began to advance, however, and
gradually crept up on the Michigan
State runner, who seemed well on his
way to victory,

Finally Pilbrow was on Chambers
lain‘s heels and for a lap they held
that position. With the stands in an
uproar, Pilbrow gradually forged
ahead and his desperate sprint at the
finish gave him a five-yard margin.
The victory was decisive, giving

’Chamberlain his secund defeat in his

entire colle ‘ to career,
closes this spring.
Relay Team Second

Equally as impressive, altho not so
spectacular was the performance of
the Pioneer mileel'elay team, which
finished second, pressing the Notre
Dame team so closely that the latter
was forced to set a new conference
record to win.

The Irish were given a long lead
by Alex Wilson, middle distance star,
who was the outstanding point win—
ner of the meet. A poor pass between
Pojman and Alexander lost a little
more ground. and ‘the Giiiinell run-
ners were left with a 2D~yard handi-l
cap, Alexander ran a great quarter
to go far flheafl of the Drake uni-
versity runner, and Murphy continued
