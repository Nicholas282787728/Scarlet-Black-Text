N0. 2: WHAT'S WRONG?

This is the second in a series of editor‘lls
upon the Grinnell system of studelit partici-
pation in government.

Last Saturday, the first in the series, in
sofar as space permitted, discussed the 01's
ganization and powers of that system as it
is at present. Today, our purpose is to in-
dicate certain disadvantages which exist in
the plan as it now stands. And that alone
is our purpose.

Space limitation prohibits our discussing
the progress already made toward good
government, and of necessity we must deal
only with the handicaps of the present
scheme. Furthermore, we are not concerned
with personalities. Whatever faults we may
point out are those of the system—not of
the individuals managing tlle system.

Our purpose is to further a better organr
ization of our campus government; it is not
to throw dirt.

There are at least four major disadvantages
in the present set—up, and these disadvanr
tages are caused by two characteristics of
the system: (I) complexity in organiza-
tion and (2) lack of centralization.
Disadvantage number one: the system is
difficult to understand. For all those not
actively participating in campus govern-
ment, the complexity of the arrangement
makes comprehension almost impossible, a
criticism that is more applicable to the
Stlldent Council than to the men’s alld
women’s governing bodies.

The ciganizatioll of the council is more
or less a bitrb bit growth rather than the
result of a preconceived plan. The conse-
quence is a medley of membcl clectcd ill
.val'ying manners and't'dking of ca at dif-
ferent times. We have the president, the
auditor, and the social chairman elected lllr
(lividllally and in a cumbersome way, the
last named assuming his duties 011 different
OCCElSimis~melnbersliip on the faculty social
committee in the spring of the year follow
ing his election and, the obligations ol’ . ur
dent social chairman the fall of the next
year.

We have two women representatives
elected ill the same complicated manner who
have been added sometime during- Lhe years
of the council’s e istencc as a counte

rrht to the offl ers Just named, who are
traditionally men.

Aide from these, there are several ox—
oi'l'icio members whose status under the

council constitution is questionable, who
vote upon what that document defines
vaguely as “major questions,” and whose
origin of membelship remains shrouded in
mystely. Also, there is yet another type
of member: the p1esidents of the men’s and
womens govelning bodies, who rank u 1th
the Voting members in spite of the fact they
have been selected to head two other groups

G

Disadvantage number two: there is no
provision whereby the student body can
demand responsibility from its officcls.
That is, there is no recall nor opportunity
for open meetings of all those concerned by
the acts of the various governing bodies~
except insofar as the latter is indicated ill
the women’s constitution.

In other words, once the officers are in,
they are ill to stay. And nothing can disr
lodge them It remains with them as to
u hat kind ol government Glinnell has, and
if it is not satisfactory to the students,
there is no recoulse save to that oi unor—
ganized complaint.

And that is the result—21ml not improve~
Iuellt.

G

Disadvantage number three: there is a
confusion of administrative and legislative
functions, again especially true of the Stu-
dent Council.

We havt an auditor and a social chailman
wllo are selected primarily for their abilities
in administering- the activities of those
offices. Their duties are heavy enough and
important enough to merit salalies, thus
indicating man-sized jobs requiring special
capabilities and quantities of time. Yet,
despite the specialization of ability and acti-
vity and despite the vast amount of work
lequired in thei obs, these officers are
expected to represent the interests of the
school— at- large and to devote their best en-
ergies to its guidance.

Perhaps there are those individuals who
can successfully fulfill both requirements,
but they are not always available. Mixing
functions does not make for maximum effie
ciency.

7 G
Disadvantage number four: there is no
adequate fixation of responsibility among
our student governing bodies.

There are three spheres of influence on
this campu that concerning the men,
that concerning the women, and that con
ceruing both men and women. Supposedly,
the Council of House Presidents is supreme
in the first sphere, the Women’s Executive
Board in the second, and the Student Coun—
cil in the third.

But are they?

These three governing bodies operate on
more or less of an equal plane. -Although
the men’s and women‘s governments may
control their spheres to a large extent, it
can not be truthfully said that the Student
Council is adequately responsible for the
third field, that ill which the interests of
both men and women cente Why? Be—
callse of the lack of centro 'ation; the Stun
dent Council cannot be sufficiently responr
sible for its sphere of influence because it
lac nlltliol'it Those problems and acti-
vitles which conceln both the men and
women are indnbitably more important than
those which concern merely the men 01'
women alone.

Yet the council is forced to attempt to
control this more important field of govern-
mont while operating on an equalior less
than crlllnlaplane with the Council of House
Board.

Tilcl is little concrete ltion of rc-
spons' ity or definition of pouers ill the
constitution of the Student Council. And it
is this lack that has resulted in the decline
in the position of that-body. it is this
lack u hicll resulted in the Ho Presidents
attempting. to deal with the C 111 ; Hall door
episode, an incident which, ill reality, con
cerned the whole school.

series will suggest a lemeily for these dil
