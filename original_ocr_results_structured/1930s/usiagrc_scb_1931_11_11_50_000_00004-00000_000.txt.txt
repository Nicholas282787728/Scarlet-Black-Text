Homecoming fans at Grinnell saw
the Pioneer eleven completely rout
Washington university here Saturday
as Hank Thomas’ accurate pass»
ing arm sent the local eleven on its
way to a 25-0 victory.

The Bears, on the other hand, fail-
ed to pierce the Grinnell defense at
all consistently, nevcr advancing
closer than the Pioneer 28-yard
stripe, and that in the final period
on a pair of long passes by Hardin.
This attack was stopped there, how—
ever,

Passes Nine Times

Nine times, Hank Thomas sent the
oval whirling down the field through
the air. Seven of these times it pass-
ed over the heads of Washington dee
renders and into the arms of Grinnell
receivers. On four of these occasions.
the receivers crossed the line for
touchdowns. Another of the attempts
counted the extra point after Grin-
nell's second touchdown.

The Pioneers swept the visitors off
their feet in the opening plays of the
game. Only Six plays were necessary
to put Grinnell across the line, a pass.

Fakes Kick

Later in the opening period, Hed-
-enkamp, Washington end, hlocked a
Grinnell print and gave the opponents
possession of the oval in Grinnell
territory. The Bears could not gain,
however. and kicked outside inside
Grinnell’s 10-yard stripe. Thomas
pulled out of the difficulty by faking
the kick, and advancing the leather
'to midfield.

A pass to McKee and an end run
by Thomas after a lateral pass, put
Grinnell three yards from goal.

tlic szeyard mark, One toss was good
for seven yards and on a backward,
forward pass play. Drmcon scored and
then took another pass for the extra
point.

James started the works in the
second canto by sprinting to the
Washington 3&yhrd mark. Thomas
advanced seven yards farther, and
their passed to Duncan for the score.

With Grinnell already holding a
1970 lead, the 2,000 fairs at the con-
test sat through a listless third
quarter as the Bears were continuzlL
ly held in check and the Pioneers
failed to open up regularly.

In the final quarter, however, Dune
can blocked Tyrell’s punt on the
Washington 20—yard line and Thomas

, immediately passed to Rose for an-

other touchdown

Thomas proved the star of the
game from the viewpoint of the fans,
and the Thomas to Duncan passing
combination worked effectively to
put Duncan again in the Missouri
Valley conference scoring lead.

The outstanding revelation of the
contest, however, was the showing
made by the Pioneer line, which
stopped the thrusts by Weingart and
Tyrell. stellar Washington backs, of-
fectivcly.

Washington could at no time cope
with the Grinnell passing attack, and
found even the bevy of lateral and
backward passes bewildering

Thomas alone gained 134 yards
while the Pioneers made 390 yards
from scrimmage and 134 from passes.
Washington collected 172 in scrimm-
age and 64 on two completed passes.

" O, I don’t know a blessed thing
about how cigarettes are made. But,
of course, I would want the tobacco to
be PURE. And then I’ve heard that the
blending is very important. I’d want t/laz‘
to be done just right.
“Then the paper. I don’t like paper
that you can taste—or smell when it’s
burning. I’d want that pure too.

“Another thing. I want to smoke when-
ever I feel like it—without worrying about

smoking too many. So I want my ciga-
rettes MILD.

“But the main thing, of course, is

TASTE. I don’t care for over-sweet—

ened cigarettes. I much prefer those that

are just sweet enough.

“Chesterﬁeld seems to satisfy in every
one of these ways, That is why I’d rather

have a Chesterﬁeld.”

ARE YOU PLANNING A

ROOM PARTY?‘

SMOKERS tire of too much sweetness
in a cigarctte, and they don't like rawness.
For a steady diet, they want a cigarette
like CHESTERFIELD — a mild and melv
low smoke. free from any ovenswcemcss
or any harshness or bitterness. That‘s
why more and more smokers every day
are changing to CHESTERFIELD.
Good . . . they’ve got to be good.
