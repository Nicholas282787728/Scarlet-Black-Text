In Tentative Form

President Nollen admitted thot the
plan as submitted is in tentative [on-n
with n number of details that must he
worked out before any effort eini .e
mode towzmi putting the plan in
action. Staff members at the meet-
ing questioned him on seveldl points
which he left in their hands.

Mr. Colbert today expressed his
dissatisfaction in present laboratory
facilities for journalism students and
a hope that a closer alignment with
The Scarlet and Black might be made
possible through reorganization.
Both President Nollen and Mr. Coir
bcrt were emphatic on the point that
such a move was in no way to bring
faculty supervision to news or edia
torial policies of the paper.

“or course there are weaknesses in
the present arrangement,” said Mr.
Clayton, “but I'm not at all certain
that they can be remedied thru
such a plan. Even student control
boards have proved highly unsatis-

pay to go over the plan thoroly, how-
ever.

The terms of Mr. Clayton and Mix
Morrison as heads of The Scarlet and

early consideration if the change is

A WORD ABOUT

FALLt

1e great instruments of business in use

today, CREDIT is probably as Vital as any one

factor. CREDIT permits the transaction of busmess
in a great many cases where othel'Wlse it might be qu1te
awkward, if not impossible to do so. However, when
the extension of credit reaches a certain loomt, we dig—
cover that instrument of business changing from Some-
thing Vital to btlslneSS life to a detriment instead. You
who are students in Gl-innell college mayplay aS big a
part as anyone in the maintenance of Vitality'm this
prime istrument, CREDIT. You may accomplish this
by caring for your own credit extenSlonS' at the local
business houses. While you are home during the vaca-
tion period try to make arrangementswuh your folks
to take care of your accounts here in Gl-mnell.
