THE UNREPRESENTED THIRD

Since there are more Grillllcll collcgc women
living in tolvll this year than usual, it seems that
ill order to become acquainted witll each other and
to have some active part ill tllc lllanagcmcnt of
student affairs. the town womcn might revive the
new dissolved toll'll women’s organ alien. That
organization was founded several yea s act) I ' the
(laughter of D. F Glass, ploi'essor of pllr S, to
give the town women all influcnco ill college at-

It has since ceased to e t c\ccpt in name,
as] ted in the college handbook.

'Iowcver, witll the present, 80 town women
forming a total that is very nearly one-third that
of the number of quadrangle women (there are
almost. 300 residents ill the cottages), might not
the town women reorgani c? Such action must
come, not from tllc quadrangle, but from tho towll
wonicu themselves. It must. to be worthwhile. be
a concerted action. There, arc ill the freshman r '5
this year, an unusual number of women living ill
town who arc enthusia lo and capablc and who
have been leaders in their res cr ivo high . hools.
They have talent and all ah y to give scrvi c,
which, if not directed into channels of loadcl‘slip
on the campus. u ill bc lost to the college.

A woman who has (int-o lived in the quad-
rangle, but has moved into town. can testify that
there is a vast difference llelwccn the full, invig-
orating life of thc quadrangle resident with many
girls who must of new ity, accept her as 0110 of
themselves and. ill living with her, learn to know
her real worth and the perplc llg’ life of the no
man who is “on itlo“ of quadrangle lifc. She must
struggle for notice, tor friends, and for influence.
One may argue that it can be better training for
life bccansc the difficulties develop character, bllt
is that true?

If their. one-third of the present fclllinillc cn-
rollmont of Grinncll college is “outside” what can
be done about it? A two-fold cffort is necessary
for action that will bring about sonic alllalgama-
tion with the college as a whole. Town girls must
ﬁrst start action for organization. If thc dean of
women, who realizes the difficulty facing town
women, could find a place for their representative-
(iixllll c on ll campus organization of [code ' the
town women would have all equal chance with
town men who urc’ already represented on the
council of house chairmen.

Both town women and the college as ll whole
would in lliutuzlll by 7t step toward fusion of
onc-thihd of the college wolncli, now unrepresented,
and tho two-thirds. who are represented. ill mall-
ag‘clllent ol' stlldllnt affai .S.

THEY LIKE THEIR JOBS
(From the Industrial Collegian)

College editors are queer people."AThat has always
been a well-known fact, but the following paragraphs,
clipped from another college paper state it pretty well.

"College editors are queer people.

“So are college newspaper business managers.

”Both believe their work the most important on
the campus. Neither tries particularly hard to convince
others about it.

“Ti a ghastly amount of time, is gobbled up by
the acti es of the collegiate editor No one knows
that better than the delegates .to their conventions. But.
they like their jobs; every sunhaked one of 'em likes his
job. That counts.”

“THEY SHALL NOT SMOKE
(From the Daily 'oi-thirestorii)

No law of man, god or , tilted alumni is ever going
to Stop Northwestern’s coeds from smoking until the
mysterious deity of fashion dictates that the cigarcth
is no longer “the thing," Until fickle fashion issues such
a dociee, the ruling alumnae of the sororities are wast-
ing their breath when they lay down such laws as that
made public yesterday.

The good ladies of the quadrangle association, the
alumnae organization which controls the government
of the women's quadrangle, last week announced to
an assembled group of house presidents that no person,
male or female, would he allowed to draw breath on a
cigarette within the sacred confines of their jurisdiction.
’ Mrs. Edson Fowler, president of the association,
gave an imposing list of reasons for the command. It
would seem that the organization had forbidden smok-
ing with one righteous eye to the physical and spiritual
welfare of the sorority women and with the other,
slightly more commercial eye. to the advantages ac-
cruing in lower insurance premiums.

“It is easier for non~smoking girls if smoking is
not permitted,” says Mrs. Fowler. We wonder, There
can be little difference in the appeal of a cigarette
enjoyed in the house and a cigarette sneaked in a car
perked near the back door, if anything, given a rule
against smoking, the pastime gains in attractiveness.

Two of the sororities on the campus have national
rulings against smoking hy their members. The quad—
rangle association absurdly claims this as cause for
depriving the other thirteen houses of the right to de-
ciae the question for themselves.

Underlying Mrs. Fowler’s entire statement runs a
tinge of suspiciously crass commercialism so that one
is led to suspect that, after all, f -e insurance premiums
have been the deciding factor in the formation of the
“no smoking rule” and that it was not a motherly con-
com on the part of the association for the morale of
its charges.

It would be interesting to see the figuics on the
premiums thut are paid at picseut hy the Women’s
houses and the increase. that would rcsuit if smoking
were allowed in thorn. The llollscs' are as fire-proof as
modern structuinl genius can make them. The cost of
insurance with or without a nonsmoking clause, cannot
be excesswc. It seems a shame to sacrifice the light of

to autonomy for thc sake of a
few extra dolla s a year.

It is not. the place of the alumnae to say whcther
there shell or shall not lye smoking in the quadrangle.
Neither is it the place of the administration. The qllcs~
tion of whether one shall or shall not smoke is entirely
a personal matter, and its solution should he left on-
tircly in the hands of the women concerned. Alumnae
edicts or no, they Will continue to smoke if they please,
Whether it be in the front parlor or on the back stoop.
