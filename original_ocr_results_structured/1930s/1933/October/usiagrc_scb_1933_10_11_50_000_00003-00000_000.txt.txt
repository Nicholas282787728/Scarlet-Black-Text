Dibble for Second Win

Gates kept its own slate clean and
robbed Dibble of its claim on first

tahiished themselves as championship
:contenders by checking up their sec
Ionel straight victory.

'goal early in the first quarter, Gates

What Do You Think

Editor, The Scarlet and Black,
Grinnell, Iowa.
Dear Sir;

I read two editorials in The Scar-
let and Black for Saturday, Oct. 7,
which interested me very much. One
was entitled “Pep Depression," the
other, “High Spirits."

The first 1 heartily agree with, al-
though it does not go half for
enough. The second, in my opinion,
is just so much ”poppycock."

Anyone who was present at the
Tutor—Pioneer game last Friday
night, as I was, and says “Spirit
was high at last night's game. Not
only was the affair tilrilliligias well
as dishearteningibut Grinncll ~s u-
dents maintained the excitement at :i
high pitch by their continuous cheer-
ing," in an editorial the next day.
must surely have been sitting in the
State Teacher bleachers from whence
issued the real cheering of the ever
hing.

The Pioneer yell lenders are not
entirely to blame, certainly they

'iried hard to dig up some cheering
from the loyal fans, although the
yells they used were mostly discord»
td by high schools some years ago.
The diificulty appeared to be in
the fact that the supposedly “spirite
eii rooters" chose to leave the noise

to the public address system and the best end runs of the year are made.

yell leaders. Four leaders look Well
on the field but we'll be darned if we
see what good it Will do if they don't
have a following. ,1

what makes
a cigarette
taste better

You can’t Afford to Be

HAT makes anything taste
better? It’s what is in it

that makes a thing taste better.
CHESTERFIELDS taste better be-
cause we buy ripe tobaccos. These
ripe tobaccos are aged two and a
half years—thirty months. During
this time the tobaccos improve—
just like wine improves by ageing.
CHESTERFIELDS taste better be-
cause they have the right kind of
home-grown tobaccos and Turkish

Tobaccos “welded together.”

We hope this answers your

question.
