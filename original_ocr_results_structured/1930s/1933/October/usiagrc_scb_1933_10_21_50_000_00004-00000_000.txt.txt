sprained ankle, wcro inilwarks at the

Pete McKee and Harold Anderson,
ends, were down the field on Grinnell
punts, downing the ball several times
before Bulldog backs could get their
clutches on it,

In the center of the line Bob Sut-
ton and Butch Mcetcr stopped the
majority of Drake Iincrplays cold.

Bauer-s ground-gaining ability was
seconded by that of Jim Bladlcyi
halfback, who played in the third
and fourth quarters, gaining so
yards on 10 attempts, Don Kingery
and Victor Fini both passed and ran
well, while AI Rose played his well—
known smashing game as defensive
fullback.

Fiiil Attempts Lateral

Drake’s first touchdown came in
the second quarter. Fini attempted
a lateral pass to Bauer, with the
hall on the Pioneer 30-yard stripe,
and Capt. Paul Brechler of Drake
out between the two to grab the
toss and run to the 21»yard line. Five
line smashes, one incomplete forward
pass and one completed pass were
then used by the Bulldogs to garner
their touchdown. Wieland smashed
over Grinnell's left guard for the
marker, and repeated the act for the
extra point. ‘

After this came a Pioneer march
which seemed fated for a touchdown.
Grinnell backs, with Bauer predomi-
nating, carried the ball to the Drake
35-yard line, and, after an exchange
of kicks and a Grinnell penalty, took
the oval on their own 25ryard line.

Two Passes Good

Bauer's running and a 5»yard pen»
city on Drake gave the Pioneers a
first down on their 39»yard line.
Bauer dashed offetac‘kle for 20 yards
and McKee was interfered with on
receiving Kingery's pass on the
Drake 21-yard line. Anderson, sur-
rounded by Drake players, mad! a
beautiful catch of Fini’s pass. ma
was forced out of bounds on the 5-
yard marker. On the first down, with
very little time remaining before the
end of the half, Kingery attempted
a spot pass to Anderson, the heave
being wild and the hall going to
Drake on its 20-yard line.

The second Bulldog score followed
a’fumbled punt by Henningsen on
his 29-yard hne and Brechler, the
Bulldog skipper, again stepped into
the picture by recovering. Three
line plays and a lateral pass, Potts
to Wieland, pushed the ball across
the goal, but it was called back for
holding and Drake penalized 15
yards.

miffety Scores

Wicland passed to Deskin who was
run out of hounds on the Grinnell
3»yard line, and on a fake spinner,
Raffety dashed over for a touch-
down. Crinnell linemen smeared
Swan's attempt at a placekick.

The first and third quarters were
largely punting duels, with Grinnell
leading in ground-gaining. Drake
gained 159 yards and Grinnell gained
144 yards from scrimmage during
the entire game. With only a few
exceptions, Henningsen’s punts were
beautifully executed, the ball travel-
ing 45 and 50 yards down the field
in a high spiral, giving the ends time
to rush the receiver.

From the Press Coop

Capt Paul Biechlcr of Drake was
the lad who took advantage of both
of the Bulldog touchdown breaks. He
played an alert ”heads-up" game dun

Bauer’s zig-zagging maneuvers
struck the fancy of sports writers in
the coop. other Grinnell features
which drew favorable comments
were Rose's defensive work and Ans
derson's brilliant catch of Fini's pass
during Grinnell’s almostrtouchdown
march.

The Pioneer Cheerleaders showed
plenty of leadership abilities and pop
during the game, although the Grin»
nell section was disrupted in its
cheering by the presence of so many
fans who were not familiar with the
various yells.

A number of leg injuries will de-
velop, no doubt. from the game. Bob
McKee was clipped during the fourth
quarter and several other Grinnell
men were limping badly toward the
end of the tilt.

Either no effort was made to send
the correct GrinneIl jersey numbers
to Drake for the programs, or the
players changed jerseys after the
numbers were sent in. Anyway, the

Creighton, Crinnell

to Scrap Friday

If the results of the DrakerCl'eigh—
ton and tho Dl'akesGrinnell games are
taken as a basis of comparison of
the Blucjays and the Pioneers, the
teams will enter their scheduled grid
battle on Ward field Friday night
Wth fairly even chances of success.
However, the five successive defeats
of the Grinnell squad will place it in
the position of the under dog.

It is probable that Capti Cornie
Collin of the Bluejays, who has been
out of the lineup with leg injuries
will be able to compete against Grin-
ncll.

Creighton plans to send a large
rooting section to the game, and
possibly the ROTC. band will her
company the group from Omaha.

Both Creighton and Crinnell have
met but one Missouri valley team
this year, the Bluejays losing to
Drake 6 to o, and Crinnell also fail-
ing to stop the Bulldogs in the scrap
last night,
