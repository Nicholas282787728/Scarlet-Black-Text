MILLS 0F TI-LE GODS GRIND SLOWLY

Developments oil the proposed revival of the
Pioneer Prudities, all-college rcvuo sponsored by
the Grinnell chapters of Sigma Delta Chi and
National Collegiate Players, seem to he at a stand-
still. Although results of the poll taken of 353 stu-
dents were printed in The Scarlet and Black, only
one women’s cottage and two of the men’s halls
have placed the results of the vote in their build-
ings in the hands of Mrs. Sara Sherman Pryor,
chairman of tlle dramatic council. Tllis must he
done, according to Mrs. Pryor, to make results of
the poll official.

While it seems tllat this procedure is nothing
more or less» than red-tape, it will give the organi-
zations sponsoring the project an idea of the 11“!“—
her of students who will actually attend thc revue.
and will enable them to plan expenditures accord-
ingly. However, it is our belief that enough en-
thusiasm has been manifested here for the PI'lK -
ties so that there should be no question about it
capacity audience for the attraction.

\Vow is the time to act on reviving the Pioneer
Pruditie . Since the dramatic council has requested
reports of the polls in various residence buildings.
surely it is not asking the house presidents and
cottage chairmen too lunch to deliver these reports
to Mrs. P yor.

THE COLLEGE OF THE FUTURE

Since speculation about the future seelns to
be popular, we herewith offer our idea of the future
American college: _

All educational institutions will be owned by
the state, and supervised by the staff and students
of the indi dual institution,

The state will pay all of the expenses for
higher education. Unlike today, however. only
thosenl‘ho show marked intellectual ability will
he encouraged toward higher education. Others
will be supported through school in proportion to
their capabilities and to their possible service to
society. The question will not be. “Can you afford
to pay for an educationg“, hint ratllerf‘How able
are you. and how much will you be able to do for
the soclal whole after graduation?"

Every graduate will be given a posi on in the
state immediately upoll finishing his education, for,
if\the student were to be unemployed, the state’s
investment in him would be wasted.

Class attendance will not be compulsory, as
the students, being serious ill their work, will be
given much frcedoln in pursuing their studies. of
course, there will be periodic examinations.

The countries of the world being affiliated into
a universal brotherhood, traveling and studying
abroad will he a regular part of a college educa-
tion. Not, however, to instill “culture” illto the

student, hill. since he will be the vanguard of the
next generation, in order to creatc understanding,
uoutuct, and good will Hmong the peoples of the
earth.

271 FOR WAR.
(Dolly Northwestern)

Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations
and the world disarmament conference places existing
attempts at world peace and armament control in a
critical position. Hope f_or their success was somewhat
dimmed several months ago when Japan severed all
connections with the League, But. the world was willing
to place most of the fault, deservedly or not, directly
on Japan. This is not so easily done in the ease of
Germany,

An abused child will stand just so much reprimand-
ing. Then he rebels. The same is true of a nation. Gets
many has not received fair treatment from the Allies.
For 15 years she has endured; then, feeling her
strength, she has rebelled, This rebellion seems to have
drained the very life-blood from Wilson's great inter-
national seheme. With Germany absent. the League has
now degenerated to an “organization supp‘orted by only
three world powers—Italy, France, and England."

That these conditions will lend to another great
conflict seems probable. Lloyd’s, London insurance writ-
ers. are willing to stake 2 to 1 odds in favor of war,
placing the date for its formal occurrence no farther
away than 13 short montlis.

Some of our pacifists are saying that another war
is incomprehensible. Military leaders would find them-
selves without armies to command, they assert. But in
this we are not so optimistic, A colorful hugler sounding
taps, a few sheets of war propaganda. or few ultima-
tums from those in power. and an appropriate slogan
such as “make the world unsafe for communism,” and
the fuse would be lighted.

All of which is very well except that those same
powers who issue these ultimatums will be removed a
comfortable distance from the scene of action, while the
actual costs of executing their wishes will be paid in
lives of men of college age. When war becomes a thing
of the past. and the issues which seemed so vital at the
moment are forgotten, historians will probe into the
debris to find what the real causes and results of the
war were, just as we are new learning about the last
one. While busying themselves with this task. the rest
of the world will already have gone well on the way in
preparation for still another war.

WORKING STUDENTS
(Oklahoma Daily)

Thereare three kinds of working studentsiworking
students, working students and just plain ordinary work-
ing students. The first kind works and draws pay for its
labor in the form of money. The second kind works just
as hard and gets paid, not in money, hut in a value not
easily measured. The third kindﬁwell, he‘s not import-
ant. We won’t talk about him,

The first and second kind are working toward the
same end: an education, The second kind really gets
one; the first gets a smattering. To me one of the tragr
eies that is with us every day is the working student of
the first kind who spends so much time making a, living
that he can't get the education he works for. His diplo-
ina. when he is graduated. is like all the rest of them.
As some wag said. it and a nickel will get a cup of eofe
fee, But it means something to him. It is the result of
countless hours of physical toil.

The diploma is the pay check of the second kind of
working student, the student who has sufficient money
to attend college and sufficient brains to realize that he
gets out of college just what he puts into it. He works
at studies. There’s nothing spectacular in them. He's
an unsung type of “working student." But. his diploma,
which like the others requires a nickel it he would drink
coffee. has an inestimable value to him.
