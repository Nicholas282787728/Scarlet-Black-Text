On the final night of football prac-
tice each year, it is traditional for
the captain of the team, to throw an
old shoe. over the goal post and into
a fire on the opposite side, That is.
the shoe must go into the fire in or-

of the season. Yesterday the ritual

Prospects for a winning basket
ball team seem to be quite bright.
One thing that would seem to ad-
vance this statement more than
anything else, is that for once there
will be competition, and plenty of
'it, for the various places on the
team Lack of competition is un—
doubtedly une of the reasons why
the Grii'iiiell foothau team has been
unsuccessxul. Most of the men on
the team have been fairly sure 01
their places on the varsity all year,
and because oi this there has not

been a spirit at try rig to beat out '

another innit, in addition to the tier
sire to win games. The Grinuell
team was really not lacking in abil-
ity, and in fact it is hard to say
what has been the difficulty it
must make a player work harder,
especially if he likes the game and
wants to earn a letter, it he has
other men to fight against in order
to will the place.

Charles ”Chuck” Hoyt, the great
est runner in the middlewest, when
he attended Grinnell in 1918, and who
is now head track coach and football
trainer at the University of Michigan,
commented with great favor on the
Iowa university football team, He
said, “Morale is the thing that Iowa
has most needed in recent years and
I marvel at the spirit Ossie has de-
veloped in these boys."

Many of the coaches in the coun»
try feel that the only way that Micl
gan can be beaten is through the air.
In the Ames game, preceding the
great Michigan tussle, solem did not

l According to the Drake student
‘newspaper, the Drake Tlmes-Dclphic,
‘permissioo by the Grinncll police de-
;partment has been given to Drake
students to parade the streets of Grin-
nell before the game, The Drake band,
iother student organizations, and all
lcars from Drake will meet at the
Crinhell campus to form the line of
parade.

Possession of the Old Oakeh Bucket
