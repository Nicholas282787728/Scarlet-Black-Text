THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

 

 

By Jack Kelsey

Now that epidemics, vacations and
other distractions are completed the
Grinnell sports schedule will take the
limelight with renewed torce. Intra-
murals especially, have been neglect-
ed during the past two weeks and

consequently the waterpolo champ-
ionship game between Smith and
Dibble, the annual swimming meet,
and the kittenball tourney, have all
been postponed.

Iowa university recently received
a great deal of publicity with its in-
tersquad tootball game, in which the
Blacks were made blue, or the Blues
black and hliie, or something; and
also trom which the track received
money to romp for another season

Some people cri aim the pro-
cedure, hut irom many standpoints

when it is warm, and with no
games lying ahead or them to re—
