STUDENT GOVERNMENT 1912-33

Ill order to obtain a complete understanding
of student government on tlle Grinncll caulpu.
knowledge of the history of tlle organizations ('Ol'l-
ccrned witll it is vitally nccessttl, Such a hi.
tol'y, it is truc, cannot be all-inclusive, for the in—
terprctation placed on student government at
different times is bound to vary, depending upon
the students ill charge of such government, alld
the administration behind this government.

In 1912, a grant of power was extended by
the faculty to Grillnell college womcll, alld tllc
Women’s Self Government league was formed. In
1918 tllis grant was made permanent. Mainten-
ance of social traditions, and enforcement of house
regulations ill cooperation with. the clean of no
men were tllc leading functions of the group. Ac-
cording to a rcccllt college pamphlet, “Wor lug
ill close cooperation with tllc dean of women, the
league board enacts and enforces rules conccrning
hours, activities and social functions.”

The Student Council was organized ill 1913 as
“a medium between the students and' faculty and
a central conference group for the discussion of
college problems.” Its purpose as a central con»
forence grollp, according to its constitution, was
three-fold: 1. For the promotion of mutual under-
standing omong campus organizations. the Woul—
en’s league and the Council of House Chairmen.
2. For the discussion of the problem of the entire
student body. 3. For the promotion ill every way
possible of the best interests of Grinncll college.
Its duties and powcrs were 1.0 be effected through
the work of the following committees: pep, recrea-
tion, social, alld traditions and hospitality, while
the council 5 also granted power to supervise
any other allvcollege activities of the student body
not mentioned in tile preceding section, and to
make provision for such supervision. The method
of election, according to the constitution, was to
be by the Council of House Presidents and Women’s
Self Government league, except ill the cases of
traditional members of the council such as the
president of the Y.M.C‘.A., editor of The Soul‘let
and Block, etc.

The organization which once exerted tllc
greatest power on the campus was the men’s gov»
el'lling body. After erection of the men’s dormiton
ies in 1917, a Men’s Senate and Court was drawn
up in 1921. Disciplillc, conduct, and social life
were ill the hands of this group, and the court had
complete'control of men’s goverllmcllt “so longr
as the students were able to control the body
politic.” That the students‘ﬁvcre not able ”to coll-
trol the body politic" is illfc red by the fact that
in 1928, this system was abolished and 1lle Council
of House Chairmen, later to be known as the
Council of House Presidents, was established.
Powers and duties of this latter group are some»
what vague. According to a recent college pamph-
let, “it meets each week to consider alld pass upon
matters concerning the activities alld conduct of
the men, alld to promote congenial living- and ft
high standard of work, Although filial authority
in luctillg out discipline rests with the atllnin . tra-
live authorities of the college, most of the cases
are handled by the council.”

In surveying this history, it may be seen that
whereas the women’s government has grown in
power, the men's group has been curtailed, and
the Student Council ha. either to “gotten or neglect-
cd some of its powers and duti s. For example,
among early by-laws of the Women ’3 Self Govern-
ment league were rules forbidding such affairs as
the entertainment of college men and women to-
gether, dancing (luring tllc college session, the
strolling or driving of women with men on Sun-
(lrtys, and tile reception of, men callers, with the
exception of those from ont-of—town. The “tradie
tions and hospitality committee,” lllentiollcd in the
constitution of the Student Council, if ill effect at
present might do a wealth of good on the campus,
while the general power allotcd to tllc council of
”supervising ally other all-college activitic of the
student hotly” would promote a better sp it on
the campus, and take the power of decision away
from selJ‘rintcrcstcd bodies.

An attempt will be made in the near future
to compare Grillllcll’s present system of student

goverlnnc l, with its evident lack of unity and
respollsib ity, to workable systems in other colr
logos of the, country.

CRIME AND PUNISHMENT IN RUSSIA

It is interesting to note the attitude of tllc
Soviet‘ toward llllc, ill contrast to our own. TVC
strc. the. illdi lual clement while the Ru 'ialls
emphasize the social crime. To us, murder is the
highest 0 tense. In the, Soviets, the maximum Dull:
ishment for murder is 10 vears imprisonment, with
opportunities for commutation of sentence upon
good behavior.

llowcvcr, ill tllc II. S. S. Il., willful negligence
in some great. social project, flalllarre to an impor-
tant machine, or stealing grain from tlle collec-
tive, farm results ill execution by the firing squad
or exile to Sibclld. Conspiracy against the state
i ill the same category.

\ Protecting a \l'oluans “honor” by injuring
or killing the responsible pal‘t_ is treated with
great severity in Russia. The old ideas of chiv-
alrv. and the, “bourgeois” attitude toward pure
and helpless womanhood, is held ill contempt
there.

For the most, part, the criminal ill Soviet
RI a is looked upon with sympathy rather thzlu
\ ith hate. He is gellcrallv considered weal: 0\‘
sick or u ladil 'tetl. The p lsollcl- is llcver made
to lose his sclfvrespcc he or il ,‘llrcrl or
harassed by brutal Ilcepcrs. Ill jail he is given
educational. medical, and ps elliatl'ic treatment, so
that he may once more take his normal place, in
society.

However much we may disagree with the
Soviet social system, we might do well to 1akc
heed of the highly scientific and enlightened at-
titlldc of the Russians toward crime and punish-
mcnt.

New routine freshman class of
Columbia college in a questionnaire
conducted by The Spectator, student

’ty, declared a liking for 3.2 beer
and a preference for a Phi Beta Kap-
pa key rather than a varsity letter.
On the personality and habits of
their “ideal girl" the freshmen
achieved httle agreement. The quali-
ty most emphasized in the specifica—
tions, however, was “intelligence.”
In politics 121 of the freshmen said
that they were “dycddnrthe-wool Rc~
publicans. Sixty-seven aligned them-
selves wrth the Democratic party, 24
were Socialists,‘12 Communists and
79 were undecided.

In choosing between a Phi Beta
Kappa key and a varsity letter, 235
firstryear men desired a key in pre-
ference to a letter, while 33 wanted
both. One student said he wanted a
key because "a key could be
pawncd," while another disclosed the
fact that his girl had expressed a pre-
ference for a key instead of a varsity

letter, .

Two hundred and fifteen freshmen
said they did not drink, while so ad

“LYNCH ‘Ell ~
(Washington student Life)

The tide of indignation over the sophomoric state-
ment of California's Gov. James Rolph, JR, concerning
the lynching of the kldnapers and slayers of Brooke L.
Hart, ought not stop 'sing until it has washed out the
last traces of the pernicious emotional influence which
that statement might have.

The facts of the case are so well known that it is
unnecessary for us to repeat them. The lynched men
committed a heinous crime and deserved punishment.
The people of California are in constant danger when
men of the type of Holmes and Thurmond are at liberty
and so deserve protection. The people took the affair
into their own hands, meted out the punishment them-
selves, and served as their own protectors. When the
lawless job was done, Gov. Rolph, whose tacit consent
was given for the lynching, patted the lynehers on the
hack and promised immediate pardon for any of them
whom conscientious local officers of the law might try
to prosecute.

If Cov. Rolph, as chief executive of a. powerful
state, were a student of social conditions, he would
know that the costs of the institution of lynching far
outweighed whatever temporary good it may bring
about. If he, were mueh of a lawyer, he would know
that he has deliberately violated his pledge to the pear
ple of California when he promised to see that the Con-
stitution of the state would be upheld and its laws en»
forced. If he were a wise public servant he would have
used every resource at his command to have averted
the lynching.

But Gov. Rolph is not a student of social Conditions.
He is not much of a lawyer, marl it is evident that he is
not a very wise public servant. so he takes it upon
himself to officially condone the lynching and to send
broadcast over the nation a long statement which in ef-
fect says that he hopes the people of other states will
use the same illegal means to see that justice is done.

The people of this country take a lot from your
California. Our women dress like California women,
our children imitate the California movie gangsters at
their daily play, and our men try to make love in the
insipid manner of the pretty play-bays of the silver
screen. so much we take from California, and perhaps
it is all right, too, that Gov. Rolph, with his warped
political philosophy is able to superimpose upon his
peoplc’an emotional delirium that induces them to do
such rash things as to vote for him.

But some of the people of this country are Sane.
some of the people are wise enough to see that lynching
can he eliminated if Ralph and other governors will see
that justice is speeded up, Such people resent the lmr
position of such ideas upon them, and wish they would
be kept, in California, for the consumption of Californi-
ans.
