exhibiting some excellent floor work
and the latter leading his team in
scoring with six points. Hemphiil led
the seniors in scoring, dropping in
four baskets for a total of eight
points.
Juniors Look Good

In the freshman-junior encounter,
the title holders led from the bee
ginning. At half time the juniors had
built up a 1375 lead. During the sec»
ond hair, largely due to the insertion
of West into the line-up, the frosh
held their opponents practically even.

The juniors were by far the smooth-
est working- combination of the four
teams. Slye was high scorer for the
afternoon with nine points on four
baskets and a gratis toss, while Air
derson followed him closely with
eight points.

Fowler, West star

Fowler saved the freshman outfit
from a worse defeat by his efficient
work at guard position. West, who
played only the last two periods for
the props, was the offensive star of
the yearling aggregation, although
outseored by Rossman five to four.

Saturday at 2:30 p.ni. the second
round will be completed. The juniors
and sophomores will clash and the
preps will oppose the seniors. Finals
of the tournament will be held Mon-
day afternoon.

President Von Klein Smid of the
University of southern California
says that college freshmen have only
about one-half the vocabulary of the
eommon laborer. “Swell," he says, is
used to describe 4,972 situations.

A college degree of M. C. (Master
Citizen) for young college alumni who
make good in public life was suggest»
an by President Alfred H. Upham of
Miami university in his opening ad-
dress to Miami students, an address
in which he deplored the lack of in—
tellectual living on the part of col-
lege graduates.

Not so long ago practically all

cigarettes were made by hand

Now, Chesterfields are made by high-speed machines
that turn out 750 cigarettes a minute; and the
cigarettes are practically not touched by hand.

 

Y the use of long steel ovens

—drying machines of the
most modern type—and by age-
ing the leaf tobacco for 30
mouths~likc wine is aged—
Chesterﬂeld tobacco is milder
and tastes better.

Only pure Cigarette paperi
the best made—is used for
Chesterﬁeld. '

And to make sure that every-
thing that goes into Chesterﬁeld
is just right, expert chemists
test zlll materials that are used

in any Way in the manufacture.
Chesterﬁelds are made and
packed in clean, up-to—ddte fac-
tories, where the air is changed
every 41/2 minutes. The mois-
tureeproof package, Wrapped in
Du Pont's No. 300 Cellophane
—tlle best made—~redches you
just as if you Went by the fac—
tory door.
In a letter to us, an emi~
nenz scientist says:
"Chestelftcld Cigarettes
are just as pure as the
water you drink. ”
