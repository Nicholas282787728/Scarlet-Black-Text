THE GRI'NNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

SATURDAY MAY 13 1933

 

By Jack Kelsey

Although it has been rumored that
some of the carpenters- unions are
contemplating building an nrk in
preparation for the repetition of the
great flood of Noahls time, several of
the intramural baseball games have
been held on schedule time.

As the recent ram has been
incamnt, it has been impossible to
get the playing field in any first—
rate condition, so that mnny or the

errors committed hale been :llilliell .

\ery easily, hecuuse or the ruttcd
shape of the diamond.

Langan hall has won two of its
games played this season. both being
awarded when the umpire called the
battles in time for dinner. According
to the intramural board, all games
that are not finished after they have
reached the fifth inning, or games
that are tied at the finish revert to
the fifth inning, and the team leading
at this time automatically wins the
ball game. Even members of Lahgan
hall. who have benefitted on two oo-
casions by the ruling, realize that it
is rather unfair to award the game
on these grounds.

It must be adniitted'thnt the
git-nos should he called within tire
'ininutes of dinner time, so that.
waiters, and ravenous students may
perform their perfunctory duties
in the dining room. Then too, there
is another intrnmurnl ruling that
will not allow the sports to be
started before 4:30 pm on week
days. It has seemed almost im-
possible so for to complete a game
in the allotted time, so that it is
very evident that a change is
necessary in order to abolish the in-
sufficient ruling in regard to the
guru Perhaps the battles could
be limited to five innings, or per-
haps day-light savings time might
be adopted in Grinnell, so that the

tilts could be played alter dinner.

Next weekend, athletes will gath-
er at Des Moines for the twenty-
sixth annual Missouri Valley con-
ference track meet: Several thrill-
ing races are expected to be held,
especially with “Iron Mike” and
Ray Sears of Butler competing in
the eightvlap jaunt. Pilbrow holds
the conference mark, having run
the two-mile in 9 minutes 37 secs
ends. at the meet last year. Sears
won the event at the Drake relays
this year, jogging the distance in 9
minutes and 35 seconds. Sears is
only a sophomore, but already he
is being ranked as one of the best
distance men in the country, hold-
ing enviable times in the mile, half-
mile, and the two-mile. At any
rate, a good race seems to be in
store for the meet, and it seems
more than likely that, with good
weather conditions, one of the men
will set a new record. We put a
lead‘nickle on Pilbrow.

e r s

Grinnell can bid good-bye to several
good points in this meet, if Harold
Alexander is still laid up with a bad
leg. Alexander is unable to compete
at the suite meet at Ames this life
ternoon, and there is some doubt as
to his recuperation in time for the
conference meet next week. Smith of
Drake, and Peyton Glass 11, of the
Oklahoma Aggies will probably hold
quite a race for the sprint honors.
Glass now holds two victories in the
competition for the sprint trophy
that is presented by the Valley officA
ials each year. In case he is capable
of winning the events this year he
will take permanent possession of
the award.

Interest in golf as an intercollegiate
sport has been gaining by leaps and
more leaps during the past few
years, and while at the present time
Grinnell is having a hard time sup-
porting as many teams as it does,
it appears as though golf will some
day be on the sports program. Two
of our rival Iowa schools, Iowa state
and Coe met awhile back in
a dual meet, and several other Iowa
schools are planning to compete,

Ball League

Steady Rain Permits Only

One Game of Series

Taking advantage of the steady‘
rain, which this Week kept other ins
tramural baseball teams idle, and of-
the league rule that all games be
called at 5:50 p. in., Langan swept
into the lead of the circuit Wednes
day afternoon by taking a well
played game from Smith 6 to 5 in
five innings.

Smith scored a brace of runs off
Henningsen, Langan hurler, in each
of the first two frames. With Patton
pitching good ball, Smith seemed,
headed for a victory. but ragged!
fielding in the fourth enabled Langan
to tie the score, 4 to 4. Smith came
back in the first of the fifth to Lake
a one-run lead, when Huggins singled
to score Bradley.

The Langanites came to bat With
less than 15 minutes to play, and
aided by some errors in the Smith
infield, scored What proved t0 he the
tying and winning runs. Whyte’s!
long double into center was the den
cisive blow of the rally. Smith scored
a run in the first of the sixth Whichi
did not count becall'Se of the time
rule.

Patton pitched exceptionally well‘
for the losers, with Bradley support-.
mg him in good style as catcher.
Henningsen hurled steadily for Lan-
gan and McMillin fielded well.

Score by innings:
Langan; 0
Smith: 2
