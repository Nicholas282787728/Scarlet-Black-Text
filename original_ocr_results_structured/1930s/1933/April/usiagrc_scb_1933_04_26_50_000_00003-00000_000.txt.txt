The mystciy of the Week. What
ardent admirer sent Georgia Cole a
present about 2 o'clock Sunday
morning? Mystery or no mystery,
it's an open secret that the gift, was
received with mixed emotions.

Society was stirred to the roots
by Butch Meeter's debut last Fri-
day evening. Butch is now an are
dent devotee of the culinary art
minus a kitchen and the tables.
Putting it bluntly, the first Meeter
picnic was a huge success

And now John Shephard rises in
an economics class to publicly deny
any responsibility for children born
of poor parents.

Somewhat belatedly the news
reaches us that on her last trip to
the hospital Martha Griggs smoked
a big, black cigar. Furthermore,
Martha feels that some public rec-
ognition of the {eat is merited. She
should feel elated that she was ever
discharged rrorn the hospital.

Four Sam.‘

For days and weeks and ever since
spring vacaion, tennis enthusiasts
have camped on the trail of the pllys
ical education department and hel-
lowed “courts.”

Even whcn the weather sobercd up
and the courts were pl‘csenmhly
rolled they weren't satisfied. Atter
two sets, the prepared courts wcrc
bad, very bad. They were pitted,
they were lumpy, thcy werc ankle
deep in an apology for clay.

The only thing to do was to pray
for rain, But rain wasn't in the die
manac. _

So Sammie Singer, caretaker, in-
vented onother idea in the way of
connecting a hose to the swimming
pool and wetting the courts. He
sprinkled them, and rolled them, and
marked them, until those tennis
courts were ready for any tournament

Then what happened?
It rained!
