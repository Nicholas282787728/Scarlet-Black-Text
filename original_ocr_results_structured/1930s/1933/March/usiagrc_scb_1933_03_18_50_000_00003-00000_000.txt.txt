Among other things disrupted by
he recent epidemic of. pyogenic
treptococcus (in our language “good
in fashioned sore throat"), the sham»
ionship game of the intramural
rater—polo tourney between Smith
nd Dibble hails, was postponed. The
ontest has been scheduled for next
~eek, and is expected to create con-
iderable enthusiasm due to the fact
l at the winner will have quite a head
art in the race for the Pottle trophy.
ibble took the honors last year. So
r this season Dibble, Smith and
awson have won the following sport
ictories respectively, basketball,
.eedhall, and cross-country. Then
.o, it will be quite interesting to
-atch “26 point” Dantorth, and Dick
llrich squirt water at each other.

According to a bulletin lrom
Marquette university, at Milwau—
kee, Comie Collin nnd Kiely, both
members or the Creighton basket—

teem selected by the Marquette

neuspuper. The Creighton men

nosed out players from Wiscon-

sin, Northwestern, Notre Dame

and Detroit to take the pldcvs.

tered. Rose will compete, however.
Grinnell is generally considered the
underdog in this meet, but it would
not be surprising if it would turn out

something.
