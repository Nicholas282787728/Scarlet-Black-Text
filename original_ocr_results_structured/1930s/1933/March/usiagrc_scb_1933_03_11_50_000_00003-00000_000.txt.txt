More and more all-Missouri Valley
conference selections are being re-
eased, and so far, Hsiilr Duncan has
-cen the only Grinncll eager to re-
eive mention. He has received places
.n second team selections made by
he Des Moines Register, Associated
-ress, Creightonien, Drake Publicity
epartment, and several other school
apers. Gaston Santi, Grinnel] guard,
eceived mention on the Creighton
econd team selection. Hank led the
ioneer scorers for the season with
20 counters, and also holds the rec-
rd tor the largest number of points
cored in one game, by ringing up 14
. the Creighton tussle.

Announcement. comes from St.

Louis that the Missouri Valley
su nming tournament, which .will
be held there Saturday afternoon,
has degenerated into a dual between
Grinnell and Washington university
of St, Louis. All other teams, either
because of financial, or lack of abil-
ity situations, have failed to enter.
The winner of the meet will be con-
sidered Missouri Valley champion,
and probably rightfully so, because
of the fact that the two teams on-
tcred are among the strongest in
this section of the country.

Washington swimmers have been

ite successful this season. taking
issouri opponents like Grinnell mer-
en have been winning from oppon-

ts in Iowa. Times of Grinuell swim-

-ers seem w’be slightly faster than
ose of the Missouri men in a recent

eet against Westminlster, but as a

hole the teams seem to be quite

enly matched. .

Medals were to have been pre-

nted to the winners of the events,

t since the reduction of the meet

. two entrants, only ribbons will be

ven to the first place men.

orces Hawk to Postpone
Six Debates This Week

“The bank moratorium has played
voc with college debating," stated
ach Rupert A. Hawk today. “We
ve had to indefinitely postpone six
rsity contests this week because
r money is tied up, and other
ools are having the same trouble."
. etters from debate coaches show
.t Drake university, Iowa state
acbers college, the University of
a, Coe college, Northwestern uni-
sity, the Universities of Chicago
- Loyola, and Morningside college
~ all waiting for the banks to act
ore making any definite plans for
- future.

dson Attieson and Dwight Camp-
1 were to meet a team from Morn-
side college yesterday morning be.
e one of Prof. J. P. Ryan's speech
ses. but the Sioux City debaters
re not able to provide for trans—
tation.

other postponed contests were with
a State Teachers college, Loyola,
rthwestern and Chicago universie
, and Lake Forest college.

-iained Mr. Hawk, “until some def-
e action is taken by the banks,
- expect to hold all of these de-
es at some future date if things
i out right."

son the Grinnell college swimming
team will invade st. Louis Friday
of next week for its final competition
of the year in the Missouri valley
conference tournament, at Washing
ton university.

The meet was previously scheduled
for today and yestcrday, but
the bank holiday necessitated the
postponement.

A comparison of times with other
teams in the league gives coach Ele
Lon.RoSen‘s men more than an even
break to take first place in the meet.
Creighton, Butler. and possibly Drake
will not have teams entered in the
contest. and the greatest amount of
competition is expected ’from Lhe
Washington university team.

\Vasllillgton “'ills

In a meet last Saturday Washing-
ton tankstei's walloped the Westminio
ster crew by taking all first places
and practicaily all seconds, to win.
The times for the meet were a few
seconds slower than those made by
the crinnell men consistently but
lack of competition is possibly the
cause for this.

Kénny, in the 100 yard freestyle,
and Schroeder, in the 440 freestyle,
seem to be the Missouri team's most
capable men. Schroeder won his event
in the Missouri Valley competition

 

last year.

The ability of the Oklahoma teamI

is doubtful, but there is a possibility
that Drake, although they have not
had a team so far this season, will
enter two exceptionally to men.
Prouty, one or the rastcst hackstrol

may enter the inch for Drake, but
already this season he has been
swunniing fol: the Des Moincs Y. M.

his eligibility.

Creighton, Butler, Drake and tho
Oklahoma Aggics will not have teams
entered in the contest.
