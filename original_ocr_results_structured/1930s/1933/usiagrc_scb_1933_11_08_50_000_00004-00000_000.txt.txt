When Grinnell plays the Haskell
Indian eleven next Saturday attel-
noon it will seem like a lapse nito
the days of Daniel Boone, with the
exception that a football will be useﬂ
instead of a tomohcwk, and the grids
iron will replace the battlefield; but
nevertheless, it will be the Pioneers
against the Indians, and the former
would like to turn the tables and
bring book a few of the Indian Scalps.
Eight indion tribes are represented
on the Haskell team, and their coach,
Gus Welch, is a former star player
for the Carlislo indian aggregation

only once before sincc Coach VVzltt
has been mentor for the Pioneers, hus
a Grinnell team had such a long
winded losing streak. That was in
1927, and the fist year that Watt
coached hero. At that time his team
played such powerful elevens as Mer-
quette, Nebraska, and Iowa. State,
and the losses mounted to seven be-
fore the Pioneers managed to ca -
lure two games. We hope that hi -
tory will repeat itself. it is quite 1?-

football team can maintain such c
strong morale, regardless of the poor
season. The team is not a poor one,
