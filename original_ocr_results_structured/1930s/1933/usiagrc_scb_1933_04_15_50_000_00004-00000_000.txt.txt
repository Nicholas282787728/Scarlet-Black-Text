Reds Win 19-0
in Intersquad

Football Tilt

McLeod, Bradley
Score for Winners
Friday

Bauer,

Led by some brilliant playing by
several members of both the backfield
and the line, Abe Rosenbloom's foot»
ball team whitewashed the team cap-
tained by Gould in an inter-squad
game played on the speedball grounds
yesterday afternoon, 19 to o.

The red-clad men counted for two
touchdowns in the first half and one
in the second half, and used a diveisi.
fied method of attack in eaming
them. The marker came after about
eight minutes of play when Julius
Bauer heaved a long pass to Scotty
McLeod from the 25-yard line. Mc-
Leod eluded several potential tacks
lei-s and scampered over the goal
standing up.

Reds Get Break

In the second quarter the Reds
again took advantage of a break.
Recovering a lateral pass from Jim
Bradley, Bauer. after dodging
for several yards crossed the goal
line. Kingery made good a drop kick
for the extra point.

The final score and the most spec-
tacular play of the game came in
the third quarter when Bradley took
the ball on his opponents 40-yard
line and after skirting through a
wide hole in tackle, reversed his
field and raced to the goal. The at-
tempted drop kick was missed.

Gould Injured

The Whites were put to a consid-
erable disadvantage due to the fact
that their captain, “Peko” Gould,
turned his ankle in practice this
week. and was unable to play. His
place in the line was quite well taken
care of by two freshmen, Bob Innes
and Park Burrows, who smeared
many of the Reds' plays.

In one of the first plays of the
game Sammy Singer, one of the main-
stays of the White backfield turned
his ankle, but after having it repair—
ed he came back into the game.
“Burnie” Trumbull received an in.
jury to his collarrbone in the first
half and with his removal the Reds
found many holes over the center of
the White line.

Bradley Shines

Sutton was outstanding on the line

for Rosenb‘loom‘s eleven, breaking

through several times to throw his
opponents for big losses. Jim Brod-
ley was probably the outstanding per-
-formcr for the game, not only the
luminary on offense, but saving many
long gains by his tiincly tackling.
Bauer‘s passing and Henniugsen‘s
and McLeou's kicking were
noteworthy points in the game.

Those who played were: White: In-
nes, Finl, Singer, Arnold, Henning-
sen, MoFarlin, Trumbull, Bill Evans,
lllatvey, Sackett, Burrows, Hatfield,
Giddings and Erwin.

Des MoinesaExisting world records
in many track events are expected
to fall April 23 and 20 when the twen-
tyrfourtll annual Drake relays con-
vene in Des Moines.

In an atmosphere rivaling the 1932
Olympiad at Los Angelea in color
and splendor, more than 2,500 of the
nation's finest athletes will seek the
destruction of present marks.

Eapcct More than 250 Schools

More than 500 unive es, colleges
and high schools have been extended
invitations to the relays and more
than half this number is expected to
come here. Universities ranging in
location from West Virginia to Utah
have already signified their intention
to enter contests here,

Ralph Metcalfe, Marquette univer-
sity flyer, will lead a galaxy of cen-
tury sprinters to Des Moines in an
attempt to smash the world’s record
of :09.5 seconds Metcalfe flashed
down the Drake stadium track last
spring to equal this time and he
hopes to excell the record this year.
Yale lllny Enter

Possible entrance of Yale univers-
ity in the relays may bring Keith
Brown, Eli pole vaulter, to Des
Moines. Brown has consistently
vaulted over 14 feet and he may
makc Des Moines the site of a new
record. The present world‘s record is
14 feet 11/, inches held by Barnes.

Every effort is being made toward
the comfort and enjoyment of the
games by spectators. Although the
Amateur Athletic union recently
voted to adopt the metric system in
this country, Coach Franklin P,
Johnson, director, announced the foot
and yard system would be retained
here.

Marks established by competitors
are more difficult to determine by
the spectator when the distance is
in meters.

Hoyt to Refer-cc

Charles w. Hoyt of Grinnell cola
lege, who made good at the Univeiu
sity of Michigan as track coach, has
been named official referee of the
meet. Other track luminaries and
officials will make an appearance
here during the meet.

It is possible that Saling, Sentman
and Hager, three hurdling sensations
of the previous meets. may compete
in a special hurdling race at the res
lays. The three men have shared
the relay title among them for four
years. Similar events will be arrang—
cd for the enjoyment of the specta-
tor.

Made Debut in Dormitory

By Jack Kelsey

Irving Berlin is going to have some
competition soon, if William Brown-
ing and William Sanford, both fresh-
men in Langan hall, continue to co-
laborate in writing songs with such
catchy tunes, and words.

In a recent debut in the men's
dining room. few of the listeners
realized that the songs which Brown-
ing sang in his pleasing baritone. ac-
companied by Sanford in his unique
way, were original songs in both
verse and music.

Sanford hails from Montana, where
sheep are predominate and men are
glad of it. For several years he has
been playing the piano, which he
learned after 12 lessons. His music
comes by ear and after listening to

Not directly related to women's ins
tramural sports, but in connection
with women‘s athletics, five awards
have been made to girls for profic—
iency in swimming and basketball. Jo
Johnston, Grace Lysauglit, and Beth
Collette passed their senior life save

At the basketball playday at Cedar
Falls, Margaret Mordy and Margaret
Vance received their local official
ratings. This means that either of the
girls is qualified to officially referee
or umpire a basketball game.
