,lege student body presidents of
Southern California. last week again
took thc lead in attempting to form
an intelligent world opinion.

By bringing together tour of the
world‘s outstanding thinkers, includ-
ing Prof. Albert Einstein, in an in-
[tcrnational broadcast of their dis-
,cussions of univorSal economic prob-
lems, the student executives again’
won acclaim from all quarters. Last
year, they sponsored a similar broad—l
cast, during which Dr Einsteinj
spoke on world peace. ;

Gives Warning l

Apart from his general analysis of

the world economic situation, prob-‘

pressed by the "father of relativiLy"l
were in the form of a warning, first,l
against the mistaken use of words:
which arouse unreasonable and Iln-‘
reasoning emotional prejudices, and
second, against blind recognition of
improved assertions simply because;

,icans call a “Stuffed shirt" but which
lDr. Einstein euphemizcd as “the‘
black dress suit which creates an at-
mosphere of well-sounding oratory.”
I These factors, he said, represent
two of the greatest obstacles which

He expressed the hope that France
would lead the way toward a general

,“.~\ good offense is the best defense." ,

l “No one can deny that we are
passing today, not only through an
international crisis in economic life,
bill. also through jllsl. as severe a
crisis in international confidence and
quite generally in international co-
operation in all domains", he said.
“Willi this crisis are connected emos
tional tensions between governments
and peoples which can only be allevr
iated by the dispassionatc investiga-
tion of their causes.”

And overshadowing all this, he
lsaid, must come it morc complete
recognition of spiritual values and

Blames Technical Advance

Speaking in English, in contrast to
his last year's discourse, which had
to be translated, Einstein told his un-
seen nudienoe and the crowd which
gathered to see him at the Pasadena
Civic auditorium that the popular
tendency to blame international
economic conditions on the war debt
situation must be revised in the light
of facts which prove that technical
developments are primarily to blame.
l At the same time, he said, the ne-
cessity for a solution to the inter-
national debt prohlem is obvious, but
it must depend upon the willingness
of a creditor nation to accept pay
ment by the exchange of commodh
ties other than merely gold.

Germany Complicates

In closing, he mentioned the man-
ner in which the international situa»
'tion has been complicated by Ger-
_ma.ny's demand for military equality
'with France, While he expressed the
‘belicf that this demand is justified at
lthc present time, he declared that
the reintroduction of universal mlli~
tary service in Germany would be
