“Puritan in Meltin

g Pot” Described

at Philip Chase Lecture Monday

Harvard Professor Delivered
First Public Speech
in Alumni Hill]

"In past years novelis poets and
artists have vied with one another in
depicting America as the melting pot
of a vast number of races from all
parts of the world," stated Philip
Putnam Chasc, Harvard c change
professor in a public lecture gi en in
the auditorium of the Alumni Recitals
tion hall Monday evening at 7:30
O'clock.

"America was recognized for years
as a haven of the oppressed and a
fme refuge for those wishing to es-
cape from the intensely nationalistic
riionarchies throughout Europe," he
continued,

'Jubilaiitly Welcomed

“Through the early part of the 19th
century when the nation was still in
its infancy, the stream of immigl‘as
tion was jubilaiitly welcomed About
the middle of the century the coun.
try reached the peak of its flourish—
ing with the opening of new induss
tries. with western lands under cllltis
vation. and with greatly augmented
purchasing power.

"However, the rapid disappearance
of this public land and the resulting
over supply of labor began to alarm
farmers and others interested in the
welfare of the country. There was al-
so some apprehension over the Dublin
her of anarchists making their 5p~
pearance in some of the larger Cities.”

Triple Program Adopted

Professor Chase then told how a
triple program consisting of the ex-
clusion of undesirable aliens, the se—
lection or the limitation of those
physically handicapped, and the cre-
ation of artificially stimulated agents
of assimilation was adopted.

He recalled the cartoonists who at
that time depicted the flood of immin
grants as a murky stream gradually
seeping under the doors of American
homes where it was attacked with the
family broom, mop and blotting pa-
per.

nesolltcd Out dCl's

Going back to the New England
Fulﬁl—an. Dir. Chase Stated that the
Puritans, being among the first to
‘arrive on American soil, built up their
own settlements independently. And
although new colonies such as those
of William Penn and Lord Baltimore
were being established with the New
England township as a pattern, the
Puritans resented any attempt on the
part of outsiders to enter the life of
thell‘ communities. The native birth
rate was quite high. yet few immi-
grants were assimilated as in Wil-
liam Penn's “open door” colony.

Professor Chftse continued by Show-
ing that, While many settlements
along the coast were made up of
various religious groups such as the
Scotch-Irish Presbyterians, Roman
Catholics, Baptists and Methodists,
New England stood out alone as
most solely Congregational. although
it soon sylit into a liberal and a. con-
servatii'c body when the stream of
Irish immigrants began to arrive.

Catholic Church Organized

“The conservatives, of course, were
in no way to welcome the Irish immi»
grants, while the liberals being more
sympathetic became the leaders of
numerous social reforms outside dc.
nominations. Thus, as small as the
Stream was, an Irish Catholic church
Wits soon organized in Boston," stated
Mr. Chase.

After showing how these early
Irish immigrants in New England
were gradually assimilated into the
business life of America where they
(now control the affairs of more re-
cent immigrants. He Explained how
this race barrier has keen broken
down by a new policy in education
and by strirring appeals in the writ-
ings of such men as Emerson, Hale
and Brooks, who have done much to
alleviate former conditions.

“Many writers," he remarked.
”felt that the tolerance of the alien
would add to the artistic life. and
that all prejudices should be wiped
out to bring about this closer I‘Elar
tionship.”

Professor Chase also gave a de—
scl‘iption of the difficulties involved
in assimilatiug the French Canadians
into the life of New England.

Tonight in Play-Off

OMAHA, 11213.74“!th is practicals
ly certain to amount to the champ—
ionship game in this year’s Missouri
Valley conference basketball race will
be played in the Butler university
ficlohouse in Indianapolis tonight,
when Butler meets the Creighton Ilnir
versity Blnejays in the play-off game.
To date both teams are tibd for the
conference leadership with seven
games won and one lost. In their pre-
vious meeting on the Creighton floor
Coach A. A. Scllsblnger‘s Bluejays
won by a 35 to 25 score, but it was
generally agreed that Butler was
“Off" its game, while Creighton was
definitely “on."

May Decide Championship
The outcome of the Indianapolis
contest will virtually decide the loop
championship, although each team
has one more game to be played. But-
ler must meet Drake Feb. 25, \vhlch
Creighton is scheduled to play Crin-
nell the same night.
In a previous game, however, But-
ler swamped the Des Moines conten-
ders, and although Creighton was
held to a twospoint margin in its first
game with Grinnell, the scene of the
contest was the Pioneers small gym.
Since the final game will be played
on the Creighton court. Coach Scha-
binger anticipates little trouble in
dis osiiig of Gi-innell provided his
team can win from Butler.

Personal Battle

Tonight’s game will also provide a
personal battle between two of the
giants of the league. Willard Schmidt, 1
6 foot 8 inch Creighton center who
was unanimously chosen all confer-
ence pivot man last year, will be
fighting to retain his laurcls from Cy
Proffitt, a foot 3 inch Butler star.
who looms as his most dangerous ops
ponent.
Moreover, Conrad “Gurney" Collin.
Cmighton‘s brilliant forward who is
being prominently mentioned for all-
American honors, will attempt to hold
his individual scoring lead in the com
ferencc, for which Proffitt and Buddy
Wade, Oklahoma Aggie forward, are
the chief contenders
