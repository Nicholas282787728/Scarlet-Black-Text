THE BANKING SITUATION

Students of Grinnell college learned by read-
ing daily newspaper this morning, that, following
announcement of a t 0 day bank holiday in New
Yo 1: state and a three-day holiday ill Illinois,
bank in Iowa and probably all other states, have
declared temporary holidays.

It must be borne ill mind that the holiday is only
temporary and is for the protection of depositors
and other patrons A great many of the ban 5 of
Iowa utilize New York and Chicago banks for
clearing purposes and are dccla ng a holiday there-
fore, merely until the r sumption of activities in
the metropolitan centers. Governor Lehman of
New Yorl: has announced that continuous operation
of banks there will be interrupted until the close of
business Monday evening, while the order of Gov-
ernor Homer of Illinois will be in effect until Tuesr
day evening. No time lilnit has been Set on the
Iowa holiday, but Lieutenant Governor Kraschcl
has declared that the holiday is but for a few days.

Outside of temporaly inconvenience in cashing
checks, there is absolutely no reason for Grinnell
students to woo V about the banking situation.
New York and ('lll ago banks will be open the first
part of next week and othcrs will follow suit.

NO-DECISION DEBATES

Picture the entire tonal and . vhool gathered
about the promises of the Grinuell all-port anxious-
ly awaiting the ant' ipated arrival of Col, Charles
A. Lindbergh.

To the east one of the spectators catches a
glimpse of a tiny blank spccli suspended in tllc
s] The Speck gradually assumes the proportions
of a small bird. and then a mighty fowl, droning
through the azure mists. A cry goes up from the
crowd, “There he is,” and thousands of faces are
turned to the heavens.

Some of the more alert begin to apprehend
where the plane is most likely to settle alld tllcre
begins a rush for that coveted spot.

As the plane nestles in the long grass and a
man steps in under the wing to open the small door,
the air becomes charged with restrained emotions
that precede the roaring welcome to a famous pcr-
sonality,

B t instead of Lindbergh stepping forth and
apprai ng his following, a word passes bctwccu
the doorman and himself, the plane acts about, and
takes off. Picture, if you can, the crowd's reaction.

Something of a like nature oocnrrcd upon the
Grinnell campus Thursday. The heralded Minne-
sota university debaters swooped down upon Gl'll‘lr
hell and engaged in verbal combat with our local
squad. Of course everyone followed closely the
arguments set forth by the speakers of both teams
but the real interest was the audience’s anticipation

Other Opinions

PRIDE
(Wesleyan News)

We may as well face the facts, students, when we
get out of School, that this thing called pride is going
to be badly bent and pretty well covered up. The other
day a young man just out of college refused a job
because he had to work on a commission instead of a
salary. He was located in his own home town and was
not doing anything, but his pride prevailed on him and
kept him from accepting. He thought too much of him»
self and was not willing to lower himself, shall we say,
to accept a commission job. He wanted a salary but his
own egotism would not let him work on commission.
There may have been unspoken reasons why he refused
to accept but that is not of which I am speaking.

A noted lecturer once said, “Pride has lost more

young college graduates a chance for advancement than

they realize," A young fellow once refused to empty the
paper basket that the janitor unintentionally missed. He
did not lose his position, but he did make a bad im-
pression on his employer, which unconsciously affected
his advance. control pride, do not let it control you.
G
FUZZ
(The Corrienioii)

“Most people fall into the error of making their
whole life a fuzz, pleasing nobody, least of all themselves.
Compromise is the very breath of negation . . . It; is bet-
ter to please one person a great deal than to please a
number of persons a little, no matter how much offense
you give,” vehemently asserts V. SackvillerWest in her
book, “All Passion Spent.”

Fuzzihow originally and yet how aptly that color-
ful little monosyllable expresses the characteristic of so
many people which prevents them from being individ-
uals, definitely delineated characters. Averageness is
deadening. and even if compromises must be made con-
tinually, most of us make even them fuzzily.

Somehow, the person who is positive, whether in
virtues or viecs, good qualities or had, always contrives
to he more interesting in proportion to his degree of
positivity.

Witty renegades appeal to us more than saintly in-
dividuals or the dull average not only because their ad
venturesomeness is enticing but also because their po
tive qualities of courage and wit and gay spontaneity
appear the more brilliant against their backgrounds of
sober normalcy or sordid reality. They are not hypocrit-
ical but confess their vices, and by that confession en-
dear them-selves to us for their cleancut spirit, which,
paradoxically enough, is rendered worth more to us than
the spineless, colorless, but normally virtuous average.
We always suspect the very good person of being a
hypocrite, too.

Courage, either physical or spiritual, is still the
most desirable of human attributes, and it takes real
courage to be either individual and openly good or had.

We do not mean to imply that to be an individual
one must have vices in order to confess to them, and
thus be positive. Rather, we are simply reiterating the
ancient truth that convictions on any subject are useless
without the courage to uphold them. Whether the con-
victions are right or wrong, few people in this uncertain
world are qualified to say.

The most: definite path to real individual freedom
is to singe the fuzz off life and reveal its clear contours,
its definiteness and positivity.

Editor, The Scarlet and Black,
Dear Sir:

The recent editorial on prepping
has» aroused my interest in this prob-
lem which the buildings will soon
answer in various ways. May they
think clearly.

The editorial stated: “Flcshmen
should be taught a little more court
osy to upperclassmen, as well as their
professors '- A noble sentiment, to be
sure. But is discourtesy confined to
freshmen ranks? Why should not up-
perclassmeu be taught a little court
esy to their professors, or even to
freshmen?

Let's further ennohle an already
noble sentiment by prepping all
classes. We might draw up a list
every mldryear 01' men who need
“prepping" (regardless of class) and
go to it If prepping is done to make
a more courteous student body, then
some solution like the above must be
found. Classification should not be a
factor. ,

1 do not doubt the sincerity of
many who believe in prepping, for
rationalization is often unconscious,
But conscious or unconscious it
should be overcome. Tho real reason
for prepping is not to moire a more
courteous student body, and never
was. The real reason, inarticu—
late though it may be, is to
enforce the dominance and exalt
the ego of upperclassmen. If preppr
ing ever did instill humility and
courtesy in the heart of a freshman,
then prepping also made him doubly
arrogant and conceited as a sopho»
more.

1 freely confess that living in town
removes me from some of the con-
tact with this problem which should
otherwise add weight to my argu-
ment. But I have not always been re-
moved from the problem. Before com~
iiig to Gi-innell I lived in the midst
of it for six yesx‘5#in that part of
the country where prepping was born
and where it is now dying of old age
or something worse. Though I have
not seen them here, I have elsewhere
come in contact with most or all of
the problems which Grinnell faces in
disciplining its “youngsters who
monopolize the club room radios"
etc, There was a day when 1 thought
prepping was the solution, but 1 have
seen that sort of discipline fail too
ofteniantl I have seen the effect on
those who applied it,

Grlnnell is known as a pioneer col-
lege. May it ever he sol May we lead
the middle west in a movement which
is as inevitable and right as that juse
tice shall supplant injustice and wis.
dom supplant folly.

Humhly submitted (as freshmen
and sophomores should),

Dibble hall waterrpolo team continur
ed to share the intramural title with
Smith hall, whose, team won from
Clark, 26 to 21, in games played at

Dick Ullrich, who has been playing

the water-polo schedule, was added tol
the lineup for Dibble this morning“
practically assuring them of another
championship in the Pottle trophy
race. l

The game next Saturday will have
great hearing on the standings in the

 

intramural race for the Pottle trophy ,

because of the fact that Smith has

torious in the basketball tournament.

Kittenbull will he the next sport
