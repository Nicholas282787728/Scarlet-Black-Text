Grinnell Arguers Wind up Season
Without Defeats in Decision Debates

Maxeiner, Pooley in Final

Contest at Des Moines
With Drake Men

William Maxeiner and John Pooley
wound up the Grinnell debate season
with a split team contest before the
St.. Luke's Men’s Dinner club of Des
Moines last week in that city.

Pooley, and Robert Aitken of
Drake, took the negative of the ques-
tion: “Resolved, that federal iegisla»
tion be enacted embodying the prin—
ciples or the voluntary allotment
plan," against Maxeiner and the oth-
er Drake speaker, William Hoffman.

Pay Debaters

Constructive speeches were limited
to 10 minutes, and contrary to most
debates, there were no rehuttals. In-
stead, there was an open forum last-
ing for three hours. The Des Moines
men took up a collection and paid the
expenses of the Crinnell debaters.

In spite of the trouble at the time
of the bank holiday, the Crinncll de—
bate teams have engaged in 32 con-
tests this year, the varsity men par-
ticipating in 24 of these, the women
and freshmen teams four each.

Most of the debates have been non-
decision, but Griunell has won all six
of the decision contests that were
held.

Five Eligible for Pins

Dwight Campbell, Irwin Oxley,
John Pooley, Dorris Long, and El-
eanor Weeks are all eligible for the
