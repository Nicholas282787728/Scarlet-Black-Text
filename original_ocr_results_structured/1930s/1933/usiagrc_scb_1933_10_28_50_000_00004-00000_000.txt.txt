THE GRIN'NELL SCARLET AND BLACK

SATURDAY OCTOBER 28 1933' ‘

 

By JACK KELSEY

Although we can hardly call last
night-s gsmc o "moral victo
the Pioneers, at least the Cl '
team has gone home with a little
higher degree of respect for Grinnell.
One of the Omaha men volunteered
the remark that he had not seen
a running attack work so success
fully against the Bluejnys this sea-
son, commenting especially on the
elusivcncss of Bauer, and the loping
shiftiness of Bradley's running.

Grinnell players should he given a
little praise on their “never Say die
spirit.” Even though a losing team,
and despite a. Stiff schedule, in every
game they have shown the desire to
win, and have kept all opponents
hopping to take victory. They have
gone up against heavy odds, with
players injured, and yet have never
conceded an inch, “A typical Watt
learn," remarked one sports Writer.

Word from Carleton, the next
opponent on the l>ioneer schedule,
states that the earls will be en-
tirely rejuvenated for the horn..-
coming game to be played at
Northfield on November 3. Coach
Inmpe has been sending his men
through severe workouts this
week, and is working on it pass
defense. The Carleton team has ml
open date this week.

So far this season all opponents
have spent the week prior to the
Pioneer tilt working desperately on
a pass defensive. in hopes of thwart-
ing the greatly publicized Watt pass
attack. Yet, when the game is
finally played it seems as if the en—
emies reveal a much more powerful
aerial attack than the Pioneers.
Drake, Iowa State Teachers, and
Creighton, each outgoined the Grins
nell team with passes. Last night
the Bluejays attempted nine passes
for a total of 60 yards, while Grin-
nell completed only three for a total

of 24 yards.

For the first time in many years
only one Iowan was in the Creighton
university lineup when the Bluejays
tackled the Grinncll college pioneers
last night. Creighton squads in the
past have had a generous represen-
tation from the [all corn state, but
this year only Howdy Gordon, star
all-cnnferahce halfback from Council
Bluffs, opposed the Pioneers.

Paul Schmidt, Sophomore halfback
at Creighton university and under
study to Captain Corny Collin, has
scored the only three touchdowns
made thus far this season by the
Bluej‘ays, . . Two “daddies" were in
the Creighton university lineup last
night. They were Max Egbert, sopho»
more fullback, who has two children,
and Dick Tomlinson, junior guard,
who has one. . . Three former copper
miners on the Bluejay Squad are Mike
O’Lsary‘ and; Biff Quinn, tackle, and
Pat Holland, center, all from Butte,
Mont, where they have worked in
the copper mines to raise tuition
funds.

ner plays.

Play Fairly Even
Although Creighton held possession
of the ball during the majority of the
game, most of the play was in the
middle of the field. In the first onan

by McKee, on the Slrydrd line,

Lamps will lead his rejuvenated Carls
out on Laird field next Saturday to
meet the challenge of the Orinncll
Pioneers before a crowd of Carleton
homecoming fans, eager to see Tag
Senior in one or two more of his
spectacular touchdown runs The
lCarleton homecoming will hegin
with a pep- -fest on Friday evening,
Nov. 3, and come to a climax with
the Crinnell game at 2 p. m. on Sat-
urday, Nov. 4.

The Carleton squad has put in a
week of intensive practice in prep-
,aration for the homecoming tilt. The
earls are an entirely new team after
downing St. Olaf last week, and
Coach Elmer Lampe expects to
show its best in the last home stand
of the season, against a strong Crin-
nell team.

Carleton suffered very few injuries
11' the Ole game and those are not
serious enough to take any of the
,players from the homecoming lineup.
Bill McDonald suffered a slight
knee injury and Cy perker received
head injuries that will keep him
from practice for only a few days.

Harley Sigmond, Zumbrota hack-
field candidate, returned to the prac~
tice field yesterday after missing
practice for about four weeks due to
an eye injury. Although Sigmond-s
eye has not entirely returned to nor-
mal the doctors claim the football

 

 

competition will not affect the
jury.

Coaclic Lampc gave tiic men a
hard workout yesterday and expects
to do a lot of scrimmaging this
