NEW IDEAS WANTED
The letter published in the “What Do You
Think?” column today, touches on a problem which
is only too present oil the Grinnell campus#os well
as others. i
We agree perfectly witll the feminine writer
of the lnissive, who believes “that during this de-

,doli.n G. Wiley
Marvin Teget

pression, the campus is rather dead.” We have for

a long time thought that it IS dead and merely
awaits a decent burial.

The suggestion of a radio for dances ill the
Recreation room is a good one. It has been tlied
at other schools lllld has worked out well. It might
even be tllrdngcd for the “powers that he” to let
the dancing last it whole hour.

We edged away ll little tlt the idea of ii Wkly
entertaiillllellt perforllldllces by student talent, But.
at tlldt, there must be some good talent in 6
dents, which ht not as yet been unearthed.

Our own ’idea of a depression measure—not
that it has not been tried here before is to make
dates “Dutch treats” zlt least; until after the banks
open.

The Scarlet and Black will publish all sensible
suggestions submitted as remedies for the (-ul'rellt
“depression atmosphere" ullioll 1)l’0\£|lls about the

When it not sum i appropriated from such stu-

CAREERS END

The basketball careers of two seniors ended
last Friday night with a victory over the University
of St. Louis Although they had been the brunt
of much harsh criticism as their team fell ill le-
peated defeats, both men emphatically impressed
upon their followers ill that final game the fact
that they had never let up even in the face of
defeat.

A highly touted basketball team fell before
the Duncall-Ullrich onslaught of 19 points. That
those two lllen saw through to the finish of the
season a struggle that many held given up as futile
long ago earns for them without reservation our
highest commendatimls. To cork the bottle with it
victory was all even greater display of the Pioneer
spirit.

Othef Opinions

FOR SMALLER COLLEGES
_ (University News)

A need for smaller colleges was voiced by Stanley
King, president of Amherst college, in an address hetero
the Chicago Rotary club last Tuesday. Dr. King stress-
ed Amherst versus the larger colleges that are catering
to mass education in his address and suggested that
the contribution of the smaller colleges becomes more
vital as the large universities become larger and civili-
zation becomes more urban. So Dr. King, then, is strict-
ly in line with the trend of Harvard, Yale, and several
other universities in breaking up their large system
into smaller units, more wieldy and more productive.
Amherst, though, has the advantage, inasmuch as it
has always bad a. limited enrollment and consequently
has not entered the field of the larger universities with
their great masses of students.

Slowly but surely in the last decade or so the
tendency to disintegrate bulky classes into small inte-
grated units has grown. We in America are gradually
returning to the ancient university system on which
our own was originally modelled. We are realizing- that
the classical education of the English schools is not to
he surpassed by the mushroom vocational schools that
have sprouted in recent. ycars. The trcnd should cons
tiuiie. sinnller colleges should become the vogue, until
American Collegians approach the classical culture that
was the tradition of generations of their forbears.

COLLEGE runss MYSTIFIED
(Columbia Spectator)

Tire New York University Daily News had the ten
nierity to protest against what it considered an injustice
to a member of a minor athletic team, The News had the
brazen effrontery to “refuse to consult With the faculty
on certain editorials." The News managing board itself
went to work and raised enough money to restore to
Eli Kleinfield of the boxing team the use of his paralyzed
right arm. And the N. Y. U. Student Senate has risen
in wrath and called a halt to journalistic activities on
their campus for the next three weeks. These boys will
then be given their newspaper back again but they will
be expected to be thoroughly chastened and Willing to
play according to rules.

College editor-seam for that matter, most news»
paper editorsiuever approach that infallible state with
which the Pope, for example, has been endowed. They
have their weaknesses and they sometimes plunder with
a fair amount of consistency. However, such draconic
measures as have been taken at N. Y. U. demonstrate
a lamentable lack of understanding on Lhe part of those
gentleman who meted out this punishment.

Protest meetings are being organized and are mak-
ing much of the fact that the student senate acted as
”plaintiff, prosecutor and judge,” giving the News and
its supporters no opportunity to make themselves heard.
This. it seems to us, is far from being the worst aspect
of the affair. The idea that the editorial staff of a news-
paper should be responsible to an untrained outside group
and should be forced to answer to that group for its
editorial policies is the central wrong in the News case.
Those who believe in a free college press should unite in
opposition to such high-handed action as that just taken
at N. Y. U,

PLAYING OUR HAND IN THE “NEW DEAL"
(Iowa state student)

Despite the black storm clouds now hovering over
the nation, there are several good reasons for believing
that these clouds will soon break up and that the sun
will burst through once more to cheer up a storm-weary
nation,

For the last four years dark clouds have been thuns
den'ng a cross the nation’s skies, raining their burden
of economic, political and social troubles on the people

The American citizen has almost come to the point
where he picks up his morning paper to see what has
happened next.

But this downpour of trouble has had its beneficial
effects. People have been forced to “sit up and take
notice" of what is going on about them and of how and
why the nation's business is conducted.

Even the college student has taken an interest in
and is a little stlrred up about our present situation.

The situation is forcing people to realize that they
are living to an age wherein individualism and group
isolation are not tolerated. They are realizing that they
can't stand on their own feet alone. and that national
_and international cooperation is an essential plank in
the reconstruction platform.

The most encouraging feature about the situation
today is the confidence the American people are show-
ing in President Roosevelt and the administration, An-
other bright beam is the fact that political barriers are
breaking down to make way for the country‘s best
minds to clear up the situation. Still another encourag-
ing feature is Roosevelt's immediate adoption of the
slogan, “Action, not words,”

Without confluence of the people, the administra-
tion can do nothing. But the administration has that
confidence right now as probably fcw administrations
have. The country is rightfully looking for President
Roosevelt’s “new deal," and latest developments indicate
that it Will get it.

FARM RELIEF NEEDED
(Daily Trojan)

The recent activities of the farmer has disclosed a
most unwholesorne situation, Just recently a thousand
farmers of Gratiot county, Michigan, hrokle into a bank,
robbed a United States treasury official, took command
of a foreclosure sale and purchased the livestock and
equipment of one of their members for $3.30. This same
militant group then forced its way into the Ithita
National Bank, commanded the cashier to open the
vault and destroyed the thousand dollar mortgage held
against the foreclosed farm.

This is, indeed, a sad plight we find ourselves in.
Theoretically we are dedicated to the principal tnat
“civil authority is superior to military authority." In
view of this ideal, the action of these Michigan farmers
amounts to open revolt. ,

The farmer has for years agitated for economic
equality. He has beseeched our national and state legis-
lative bodies to create and enforce a plan which would
make it possible for him to legally and morally satisfy
his just. and due obligations. His pleas, apparently. have
fallen upon deaf ears. Now he is taking matters into
his own hands. and as a result is waging an open war
against law and order,

The present attempt by the various state legislatures
to cope with the situation is pregnant with difficulties.

nAmCALISM
(Tulane Hullabaloo)

"Rndlcalism" is the word that bobs before the eye
of the reader and the ear of the listener so often that it
becomes almost as- familiar as “the” and “,"I those two
words that are the most commonly used in the English
language. The term is very freely applied to almost
everybody and everything. People and ideas that are
really conservative often are accused of being “radical"
and are therefore condemned.

The reason for the popularity of this term and its
frequent application to individuals lies in the fact that
anything that contradicts the existing order is judged
“radical," Anything contrary to custom is usually
frowned upon, although sometimes it is merely subject-
ed to lidieule, Liberal tendencies always are claimed to
be erratic and often are associated with “radicalism."

Plans fol change are put forward in different ways.
Some pelsons adopt the policy of “watchful waiting,“
slowly winning their opponents over to their side. others
say what they think, minding not on whose pet preju-
dices they step in the meantime.

lieve it is something that the upper-
class look back upon 85 a great ex-
pcrience,

Let's have it; it Will be good for
them.

William Leachmiul: Absolutely.
There are just a few preps who are
in dire need of “the board of educae
tiou.”

S. Singer: There are certain bene-
ficial things to be gained from col-
lege besides the ability to think and
study. “Hell Week" gives the fresh
man. that extra something out of his
college that he should not miss.

Jack E. Man-held: There is nothing
quite as impressive to the average
freshman as an old fashioned “Hell
Week" with all the trimmings. Dis
pline in regard to freshman duties
has been sadly lacking this year be-
cause there has been no definite
threat of a “Hell Week" held over the
heads of the boys. There are those
who learn much more rapidly through
their bodies than through their heads.

Richard Ullrich: I believe that
there is no place for a Hell Week in
our present school calendar. Any form
of prepping or other so called fools
ishness meets with too much critics
ism from a number of sources. Al—
though I believe that there is n defi—
nite need for well organized prepping
throughout the year, “Hell Week with
the restrictions and lack of organiza-
tion characteristic of the past few
years warrants no support.

Gaston Santi: “Prepping" would
undoubtedly be of a great benefit to-
ward teaching a freshman respect.
reliability and dependability, if Cou—
ducted in the proper manner, but
since we have no means of control
over the freshman this is impossible.
Therefore if there is no definite pur-
pose. “Hell Week" should be abolr
isiied.

Clarence dairies: In my opinion
“Hell Week" has been selfraholished
through lack of interest. It is a great
deal of bother for the upper-classmen
as well as freshmen. and as our primr
itive instincts and delights can no
more be officially recognized, upper
classmen seem to have lost interest

If disillusioned freshmen have not
been properly subordinated by this
time, it appears extremely doubtful
that two days of hidden disgust will
help those falling in either category.

Compgted Meaxs
Cottage In 1904

(Continued from page 1)

At the opening of the fall term in
1903, work was in progress for the
enlargement of the girls’ cottage.
Nine thousand dollars had been ap-
propriated for the refurnishing of old
rooms and the construction of new
ones. The old dining room had been
made into a parlor and a new dining
room was being built that would seat
so people.

Completed in 1904

The completion of the modern
building was celebrated on Jan. 30,
1904. The Feb, 3 edition of the Scar-
let and Black says that “300 people
came to the house-warming reception
to view the rooms which were models
of tasty coziness furnished and ar-
ranged witb all the tact of the mod-
ern college girl.”

Such is the history of the freshman
cottage, the first residence to he built
for Grinnell women and a tribute to
Mrs Mary Grinn‘ell Mears.
