READY FOR THE PRUDITIES‘J

All all-college musical revue is an event rc—
mcinbcred by participants and spectators as one
of the high-lights of tllcir college careers. Songs,
dances, cocd chorus girls, comedians, novclty num-
bers, black-out sketches, and attractive costumes
and sccllcry would make the affair the hit of the
year at Grillncll, particularly because it is now
possible that a downtown theatre nlight he one
gagcd for the presentation.

If tllc studcnts of Grillnell have enough faith
in the talent and ability of Grinncll men and wom-
cll to produce such an attraction, by all means
they shollld voice their support of the Pioneer
Pruditics in the allecollcgc vote being taken this
weekend. Such an all-college project can do much
to unify the school, to raise its morale, and to
instill a spirit of accomplishment on the campus,
even though it bc dccmed unimportant and even
a Waste of. time by some faculty members,

Students with latcnt talents are given a chance
to display them in such a production. More than
that they 9 given a chance to do creative work,
which, while not of a classical nature, is most cil-
;ioyable and of real benefit.

If, however, students feel that the Grinncll
student body is devoid of cithel‘ ambition or talent
in this direction, then surely they should register
a negative vote.

Gr
CHANGING LUNCHEON HOURS

Luncheon hours at the men’s dormitories have
undergone numerous changes in the last year or so.
In the first place, the hour was fixed ill the same
manner as that for dinner, but difficulties were cn-
countcrcd because of waiters and lunchcrs who
were forced to rllsh from late classes, and because
of the air of tenscness and speed in the dining
room,

That was the reason for the adoption of an
elastic schedule for the noon meal, first ranging
from 12 :15 to 12 :45 p. 111.; next from 12 :25 to 12:45
-p. m., and finally, from noon until 12 :30 p, in.

.“lith the last Schedule, it is hoped that those
students who do not have classes at 11:20 a. in.,
will enter the dining room at noon in an orderly
fashion. As classes are dismissed thc remainder of
the men may enter at any time between the time
that they are dismissed and 12:30 p. m, In this
way, it is hoped that the noon meal will not only
be made more enjoyable, lessening the partici-
pant’s feeling of that of a bird poised for flight,
but will also alleviate the rush at the door.

SOPHISTICA’I'ION ON- THE WANT!

Ycors of caustic criticism from the lips of par-
ents and professors, editors and hot] carriers that
had virtually driven vociferous and emotional col-
lege spirit into oblivion fell helpless before the
avalanche of freshman enthusiasm at the pep meet

hall Thursday night. It was there that the fresh—

UPT‘ON SINCLAIR TURNS “PINK”

There is a great moaning alld tearing of hair
ill radical circles, for Upton Sinclair is joining,r the
Democrats. Yes, Comrade Sinclair, militant So-
cialist, luuckrakcr, novelist and propagaudist, has
decided he would like to rlln for the governorship
of Culifol'llir’tﬁon the Democratic ticket.

No doubt Sinclair is ill for a lot of bitter c it-
icisln and nuldslinging for his apostasv. \Vhat k id
of a mall is Upton Sincla . Is he sin , rel Or, is he
merely all opportunist who (‘0115i(10|‘s~hls own wcle
{are above that of the lnnsst‘s for whom he claims
he has devoted his life?

At the age of 28. Upton Sinclair investigated
the-Chicago stockyards, which slncllcd had ill more
ways than one. He wrote his famous novel, “The
Jungle,“ based on his investigations. The book
stirred up the reformers of the day, President The-
odore Roosevelt red the book, and sent a commit-
tee to vcrify Sinclai s claims. The result was the
passage of the Pure Food Laws

Not content with this signal contribution to so-
cial reform and to the hygiene of American bellies;
Sinclair, passionate humanitarian that he was,
turned his efforts toward insuring justice for the
submerged alld oppressed. He founded the Ameri-
can Civil Liberties lulion,

\Vllcn the bloody Colorado coal strike of 1913
occurred, Upton Sinclair was Johnn on-thc-spot.
At the risk of bodily injury by pugnaclous strike-
breakcrs, our hero snoopcd around, found out n
grcat deal, and wrote another novel, “King Coal,”
which materially aided in bringing economic jus~
ties, for thc exploited miners,

And then came the notorious SaccoeVanzctti
case. Sinclair believed that the two Italians had
been framed. IIc delved into the matter, and ii
nally wrote his version of the case ill his “Boston.”
The Pulitzer Prize committee thought that the
book would have deserved the Pulitzer prize for
1028, had it not contained so much radical propit-
ganda, as that spoilcd its artistic valuc. Tllc acs~
tlletcs on the committee would probably have done
the same to “Les Miserables,” although Sinclair
may by no means be compared to Victor Hugo.

‘ch are not primarily interested in advancing
Mr. Sinclair’s gubernatorial ambition, but we do
believe that he is sincere in feeling that he will be
able to advance the cause of socialism more if he
joins himself to the popular Democrats ill the next
election in California. As far as we know, Upton
Sinclair has been idealistically honest. Many times
he could have become Wealthy, and he withheld
some of his “revelations.” Often ho had to publish
his own books because he had been blacklisted by
publishers. Whenever he could, he sold his books
at preposterously low prices, ill order to put them
into the hands of thc colnmon people.

Upton Sinclair. however much we may disA
agree with his politics, deserves a place with Jane
Addams and Lincoln Steffens as one of the great
social reformers of America. .

“Progress in science and astron—
omy best illustrates the amazing re-
sults that the insignificant being
called man has achieved," William .1.
Rusk, professor of mathematics and
astronomy pointed out.

“All accomplishment has been
brought about by the unselfish co-
operation of all scientists,” Professor
Rusk went on to say.

The accomplishment in the field
of Science by those equipped for the
taslr was used by Professor Rusk as

 

an example to bring out the thought
that the solution of present social
problems must likewise be solved by
the earnest err-operation of those who
know how.
