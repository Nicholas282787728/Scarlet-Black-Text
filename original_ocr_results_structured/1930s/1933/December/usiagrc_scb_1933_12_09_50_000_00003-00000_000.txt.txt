Victim of Role

conviction falters in the last act
and it does not strike the same sure
note. James coddington, who portrays
well his part as young Major Bannis-
ter, is the victim of his role which
is not in keeping with the fatal
resolution which he makes at the
play's climax.

John corhen, in his review of the
first production of "Children of thei
Moon,” points out that the fault of
the unconvincing ending may not he
in what happens, but in lack of dra-
matic preparation for i perhaps al-
so in a lack of suitability in the
character.

The same unsuiishility of the
character might be applied in last
night’s performance as the reason
for the somewhat ludicrous effect of
the ending. Coddington as Major

,. Bannister was not the tragic figure
his character at the end of the play
would imply, but rather a normal
youth who suddenly rose to the pin-
uncle of tragic exaltatiun and des—
pair.

 

Direction Smuoﬂl

On the whole, the production was _

carried along with the smoothness

which typifies the plays directed by . ,

Mrs. Sara Sherman Pryor Louise
Smith, student director, who aided
Mrs. Pryor, seems to have caught the
feeling of the play and projected it
strongly to her cast.

Make up and costumes were well-
selected, going a long way toward
producing the proper effect of char»
aster. Setting and lighting were once

more triumphs over the meagre stage -

facilities. Moonlight and sound ef-

fects of fog horns, an airplane motor ,'

and ceaseless pounding of surf against

the cliffs outside were representediﬁs

.realisucally hy ingenuous devices.

Well, the inevitable has happened
and Ruth Elects Fink has at last
decided that her future shall be cast
always and always (well, anyway
for a few weeks) with Jim Cuddling-

The frankest confession oi the
week comes from Ruth Crohh, she
was attempting a card trick at the
college shop the other day in which
a vital part depended upon the
position of her hands behind Ihcr.
Apologeticnuy, she remarked that
she was not quite sure that she
could do the trick in a real pro-
fessional manner due to the [met
that she had never been able to get

really would like to see the last of

complaint, of course; it is merely a
suggestion.

A good many interested people
have been uniting for Dean Beatty
to smoke the cigar that Whitmore
gave him at the Gridiron banquet
a few weeks ago and now the sad
news comes out that he gave it to
one of his best friends. The joke
is that the stogie was donated by
a store downtoun from its stock of

stale cllemofs.
