Veteran Cage
Five to Start
in First Tilt

Letterman Will Get Call
Against Tutor Quintet
Next Saturday

Unless the outstanding work of

some of the other cage aspirants
justifies o change, John C. Truesdalc,
varsity basketball mentor, will start
all five letter men against State
Teachers next.§aturday, he announc-
ed yesterday. This line-up would in-
clude Mason and Frye at forwards,
Phelps, center, and Captain Santi and
Mal-ins, guards.
.Coach Truesdale stated, however,
that at least two full teams would
likely be used during the tilt. He
named DuMont, at guard. aliphant
and Bauer at forwards, Morgan at
center, and McCully at either center
or forward, as others who would
probably see service.

Practice last night was held at the
high school gymnasium since the col-
lege court was cleaned and painted
over Thanksgiving. No practice was
held this afternoon as a number of
the squad members. were out of
town. The Monday session will be
postponed until evening to allow the
interclass cagers to run off the first
round of their tournament in the air
ternoon.

During the session held at the
high school, Coach Trucsdale experle
mented with McCully at center, on
the tiproff, having him change off
with Bauer on offense, the latter
taking the pivot position while MC—
Cully played the corner of the court.
The center position is still his great
est source of worry, the coach ad-
mitted. He stated, though, that
Morgan has been ir‘rrpro rig rapidly
and shows signs of developing into
a first class pivot man,

“Perhaps the Teachers game will
reveal which of the candidates will be
able to contribute the most at the
center position,” Truesdale said yes-
terday, “but at the present none of
the candidates seem more likely to
earn the first string position than
any of the others."

Aquatic Team
Plans Contests

Tentative Meets Arranged
With Three schools

With correspondence being carried
on with three different schools in an
attempt to arrange meets, the varsity
swimming schedule is beginning to
take shape. Gustavus Adolphus col-
lege has asked for a contest with
Grinncll here on Jan. 31. This tilt
will be definitely slated if the ath-
letic hoard passes favorably upon it.

Crinnell has applied to Nebraska
for a meet with the Big Six school
sometime shortly after Christmas va—
cation. Whether the contest will be
schedule or not depends upon the
action of the Nebraska athletic
board at its meeting on Dec. 8,

Carleton also has been written to
in hope of arranging for a meet with
the Carls in the Grinnell pool. The
mid-west A. A. U. meet at Amos will
likely draw a few Grinnell entries,
also. The date for this affair has not
yet been set.

According to Davc Malbrough, stil—
dent_coach,the swimming squad is
still in need of another first class
diver, and free style material
somewhat scarce.

Slecc’ind Play
Will Portray'
‘Mad’ Family

Pilgrim, Codflington Head
‘Children of the Moon’
Cast Next Friday

All the thrills of life in the midst
of a “moon mad" family in a lonely
country house on the English sea
coast will be revealed in the presen-
tation of Martin Flavin-s “Children
of the Moon," Friday at 8:15 pm.
in the auditorium of Alumni Recita-
tion hall.

Louise Smith, at, majoring in
drama, is directing the play which is
the second major production of the
season. She is the first under-grad-
uate student at Crinnell to direct a
‘three-act play as part of her work
here, according to Mrs. Sara Sherman
Pryor, head of the department.

Loves Aviator

The feminine lead in the cast is be—
ing taken by Ruth Pilgrim, soph-
omore, who plays the part of Jane
Atherton, youngest of the "mad"
Athertons, who is kept in ignorance
of her heritage until she falls in love
with an aviator, whose plane makes
a forced landing near the country
estate.

other members of the cast include
Baxter Smith, freshman, in the role
of Judge Atherton, Jane's grand-
father, who spends his timo peering
at the moon through his telescope,
and who becomes moody and dis-
traught when the moon is full.

Selfish Mother

Jane Searlc, freshman, is Laura
Aihertun, Jane-s selfish, tyrannical
mother. The role of the young avia—
tor, Major John Bannister, is taken
by James Coddington.

'Helen Dawson, senior, is Madame
Atherton, wife of the judge, and
Guilford Collison, senior. is Doctor
Wetheroe, family physician. The role
of Major Bannister's mechanic, Wal—
tcr Higgs, will be portrayed by Rob-
ert M. Brown, and Robert Polachelr
will be Thomas, the butler.
Lunar Iiays Madden

A strong atmosphere of varying
moods and psychic reactions charac-
tcrizes the plot. It seems that the
Athertons have inherited the belief
that the rays of the moon produce
insanity in the famil Jane’s father,
on the night of her birth, had driven
his carriage over the side of a cliff.
Her brother, on aviator in the war,
dove to his death another night, al»
though seemingly his plane had been
in good shape. On both nights, the
moon had been full.

As the story begins, Major Bannis»
tcr, also an aviator, is taking refuge
in the Atherton home because of a
forced landing nearby. The scene is
the somber oldrfashloned reception
room of the country home, and the
time occupies but one day. Jane
Atherton, ignorant of her supposed
“moon madness." falls in love with
him, but the romance is suppressed
by her mother.

Surprise Ending
Romance and suspense are other
features of the action, and the climax

comes in an ending which is thrilling
and unsuspected.

Ruth Hobson is stage manager,
assisted by Margaret Vance. Louise
Willard is property director, Margaret
Wesson, in charge of costumes, and
Helene Blake, in charge of lighting.

Reserved seats for the production
are now on sale, according to Mrs.
Pryor. Students who have season
drama tickets may exchange them
for reserved seats.
