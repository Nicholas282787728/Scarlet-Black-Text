A few days ago the sport writers
throughout the middle-west were all
busy filling the vacancy that was to
be left in the Big Ten by the merger
of Northwestern and Chicago. Michir

President Hutchins of Chicago uni-
versity spoiled the whole show by an-
nouncing that undergraduate work
will be continued at both schools. for
the present at least, and that the
sport programs of both institutions

Speaking of firing coaches, it is
interesting to note that Notre Dame
has solved her coaching difficulties
already. Yesterday, Elmer Layden,
'one of the Four Horsemen, a native
of Davenport, and coach at Du»
quesne university during the past six
years, was selected to succeed
“Hunk” Anderson as head mentor for
the Irish. Layden has had spectac-
ular success at the Eastern school.
in 1929 his eleven went through the
:season undefeated, and during the
past season, his auttit lost only one
contest, and that to the powerful Pitt
team.

Camels are a more likable cigarette—
and that they don’t upset your nerves.
