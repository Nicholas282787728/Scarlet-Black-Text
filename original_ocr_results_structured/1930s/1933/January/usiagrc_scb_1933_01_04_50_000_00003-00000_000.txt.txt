Team Develops

Three outstanding developments
featured the-vacation practice drills:
first, the much improved showing of
Bob Morgan, 6 foot 4 inch center
candidate; the continued good work
of Gaston Santi, the lithe
guard; and the surprising aggressive—
ness of Les Manns, who seems de-
termined to work his way into steady
service at a backcourt job.

Morgan was tried at guard earlier
in the year. but when Truesdale
shifted him to center, he seemed more
adept at handling the ball and his
height has enabled him to drop in
many short shots. Morgan lacks the
ability to go after the ball that
Phelps has, but he has at last come
into the‘llmelight and promises to
give Phelps a real battle for the pivot
position.

Santi Consistent

Santi has worked into the Duncan-
Ullrich-Mason basket-making com-
bination with remarkable smooth—
ness, and has shown through his con-
