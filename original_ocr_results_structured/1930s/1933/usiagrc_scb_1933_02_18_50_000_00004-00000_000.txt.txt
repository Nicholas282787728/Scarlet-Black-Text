- I I
Campus Opinion g

Are you in (mar of the present
grading system?

Robert Sutton: I believe the pres-
ent grading system has failed, The
Students still think in terms of “A,
B. C” etc. \Vhich is directly against
the principle of the system. I would
advocate cutting out the “P‘s". Then
either a student passes or does not.

JDIIII Silt‘phzlrﬂ mid Rodney Gley-
stcen: There are too many low
grades.

\Villlnm lualxeinor: I am not in
favor of the present grading system.-‘
My opinion is based upon two rea-
Sons: one, that under the present sys-
tem there is uncertainty as to my
Scholastic work; two, that despite all
theory and argument, grades are still
the measuring stick by which jobs,
Scholarships and admittance to extra-
curricular activities are measured.
Under the present system there is
too long a period of uncertainty.

Joseph Mandorlcld: We are on the
fence, So many grade points must
be made, but they do not want to
give us our grades until the middle
of the summer. During the year, we
are not able to determine how things
are progressing. I would say “out
tout" one 01‘ the other and get on the
ground.

R. Spouidnigr Personally, I am not
in favor of grades in any form. Af-
ter all, it's not the grades which:
count, It's the knowledge which we
receive and retain.

III 35011 l‘rleyer: If a System can be
created where students can be accur-
ately graded; then let’s have the ”A,
B, C's”. But if the powers insist O
the present, then let's do 8.wa with

NOT A SINGLE REASON

Why you shouldn't have a
new skirt, SPURGEON'S
have a glorious assortment
of spring and late winter-
skirts reasonably priced at
only $1.98, They are in all
sizes, pleated and straight,
dark and light colors. and in
heavy and light weight wool-
cns. See them today.

YOU’VE NO IDEA

How much nicer your shoes
will look after you have the
soles mended and heels fixed
at JOE MARCHELLINO’S.
This kind of weather is grand
for walking but hard on
shoes. .yoe always gives you
the kind of service you like.

the “P's.”

George viiii Nostriuid: The chief
objection to the present system comes
from students planning on graduate
work. They should and can know
their grades under the present sys-
tem, therefore this objection is “he
founded. With the average student,
it has eliminated excessive grade
consciousness, and for that reason is
a SuCCeSS.'

George Mini.» In my humble
opinion, the present grading system
is not as conducive to good study as
the “A, B, c" method would be. An
“”5 indicates that we are doing satis-
factory work, and we may be con-
tent to work only for a N or for
the “S" grade that is sent to the home
folks An “A” or "B” on the grade
slip would stimulate us to our great-
est effort, and we can’t succeed in
the world by just getting by.

Constance Daiis. The prcsent sys
tem Seems satisfactory for there is
less working for a grade and more
for what can be gotten from the
course.

Betty Tebhens: I think that the
present system is too general and
that the orly way that a person can
know what is expected of him in a
course is to know what his grade is
at mid-semester and at other times.

Maxwell Ross: Why not let the
professor givo the individual student
his grade in a personal conference at
the end of the semester? After all,
is the average student capable of de-
termining by himself how much ho is
getting out of the course? One of our
faculty members says that he was
surprised to find out how much he
didn't know that he thought he knew
after he got out of college.

Winston Miller: The college seems
to be defeating its purpose with the
resent grading system. In the last
analysis we are working for what we
get out of a course and not for
grades as such. I believe a student
may benefit by the knowledge of his
exact score. “Why worry about the
others?

Howard Gould: I imagine this new

3"system is as good as any. But why

have a grading System? Not all the
Phi Betas are the outstanding men
in the country, nor are the poorer

-coilege students all failures in life

Personally, I believe a “pass" or
“flunk", merely to prevent wholesale
loafing, would be sufficient and
would not remove the ambition to ob-
tain an education and not “just
grades" any more than the present
system.

Sam Sillge The present grading

’ ystein does not give the student a

fair means of determining just what
kind of work he is doing. It should be
changed to the old system.

Sol Jacobson: A person who goes

‘to college to get knowledge cares

little about grades; the person who
goes to college to get grades cares
little about knowledge. Take your
choice.
