Greatest Strength

with a letterman available in prac.
tically every event. Track Coach Les-
ter Duke hopes to develop a track
team that will compare favorably
with the winning team of last year.
Although without the services of
several brilliant performers of last
year. he has II veterans around whom
to build a team.

In the sprints he has Alexander and
Pojman, both lettermen and members
of last year's championship mile Te-
lay team. These two, with Murphy
and Thomas of last year completing
the quartet, now hold the fieldliouse
record at the University of Iowa,
their time being a:2a.4.

Holmes Improves

Holmes, Anderson, Wallace Grounds
and McKlveen may be able to fill the
gap left by the graduation of Murphy
and Hank Thomas. Holmes developed
fast last year and if able to start
where he left off can be counted on
to fill one place. Anderson, a sopho-
more, has a good build for a quarter
miler but will probably run a better
race outdoors. McKlveen finished sec-
ond in the 220 yard dash last year
in the Missouri Valley freshman meet.
other sprinters are Titus and Mason.

The Pioneers' greatest strength will
undoubtedly he in the distance runs
where there are Capt. Pilbrow, Gor-
don, Pfeiffer and Barber. This quar-
tet composed the Grinnell cross coun-
try team which was not defeated dur
ing the entire season last fall, Pil-
hl'ow should be greater than ever this
season; last year he was defeated ans
ly twice and counted among his vice
tories the central intercollegiate
championship. Promising sophomore
distance men are Horton and Men-
rath. brother of Howard McIirath.
former Pioneer captain and outstandr
mg distance runner.

Grounds Brothers Out

Wallace and Gene Grounds both
won their letters last year in the
hurdles but Wes Clark. a sophomore,
will run both of them good competlc
tion. Gene Grounds and Dickenson are
about the only high jumpers avail-
able.

In the broad jump Duke will have
"Snap“ James and Clark available.
James is state indoor broad jump
champion. Parzybok and Mason are
both out for basketball so will not he
in condition to pole vault until the
last two indoor meets. A promising
group of weight men can he found in
Rose, Meeter, Morgan and Crawford.
Morgan will not be available until af-
ter the present basketball season, In
the javelin throw there are Crawford
and Graflnnd, last year's valley
champion in that event.

Make Poor Showing

After giving a poor showing
against the Drake university quintet
in Des Moines last weekend, TrueSr
dale has been giving his men stiff
Jworkouts so far this week in an ef-
lion. to solve the difficulty that has
lbeen bothering the team this season.
‘Certain changes may be made in the
starting lineup. and there is a pussi-
lbility that Dick Phelps and Bob Mor-
gan, lofty centers will be eligible for
one of the two games.
l The Oklahoma aggregation 1131
been fairly successful this season
winning half of its games. The prob-
able starting lineup for the Oklahoma
group includes Simms and Wade, tor—
wards: J. Collies, center; Hurley and
Brewer, guards. Wade is one of the
leading scorers in the league and will
be a threat to the Pioneer hopes for
a second victory this season.

Lose 30 to 15

Grinnell made probably its worst
showing of the season against the
Drake cagers last Saturday night,
dropping the game an to 15, Drake
led the scoring at the end of the half
15 to 5. managing to baffle the Grim
nell guards time after time. Many of
the Grinnell shots came close to the
rim and either rolled away or slid off
the Side. Hokeson and Vanucci were
outstanding for Drake.
