THE FOOTBALL SITUATION

A powerful Creighton ulliver 'ty football team
handed Grinuell its sixth consecutive dcfcat ol' the
season on \Vnrd ficld last night. For tllc first time
this year, ill coilsideliug the home football games
to date. it may be said that the Pioneers wcrc ollt-
played by a 1- al team, altllo certainly not out-

i arts college? ‘otllillg. say

,, , . o I‘l'l in. llt members. Football is
but all incidental, tllcy Say, alid v toly or defeat
is but another incidental. Students are in college
to obtain all education, they assert, not to train
themselves as gladiators or to spend their Illlic
cheering on these gladiators.

Yet these lioglllatic statements mean nothing
all all. It remains a fact that the collegiate wnr l
lakes its football seriously—has always taken its
football seriouslyiand unless the makeup of miln
changes drastically, will continue to fakc its footy
ball Seriouslv.

So Grinncll fccls its six consecutive dofcats
lieclily, and no one feels thcm as much as tho lnclllr
hers of the pitifully small varsity Squad who havc
Tried again and again to come out on the top 0F
the heap. The team. ill its six galllcs, has 1\l£l_\(‘(l
inspired Football. ragged football, smart football.
and not so smart football, but at no time will its
members be accused of having played indifferent
football.

’lllel'e are hnl‘cl ‘ enough llicmbe of thc, ra -
sitv squad to constitute two full tcams. Tllcl'c ll
19 s than two full teams rcpur 'ng for freshman

ticc. Material llcxt ,i'eal‘. While much of it will

cll ohm-e average in calibre, will be limited.

‘ot all of Grillllell's defeats can be blamed on
the limitation of material of course. Injuries and
otliPr matters have contributed to the season l'c -
0rd. Yet, consider the enrollments of other schools
lll the Mi llri Valley conference as compared to
Grilllicll’s id]. At Creighton lllli el.ity a year
there wcl-c 2,93 stindcnts. Washington tllli\ ‘
llllrl all enrollment of 3,43], Oklahoma A. 8; M.
college, 2,600, Butler university, 1,900, and Drake
university, 1.400.

(h-innell has always prided itsclf on being the
smallest school ill the conference league, and its
teams, because they have rated on a par with those
of the larger schools, have a far—reaching reputa-
tion. Yet if the Grinnell var ty squad continues to
dwindlc in numbers to the extent that it cannot
possibly cope with a large squad which has a great
deal of reserve power, then surely action must
be taken either to improve football conditions at
Grilllicll or to drop out of the Missouri Valley coll-
ference entirely.

Students and alumni ,wollld he most unfavor—
ably impressed by the latter action, They rclnclil-
her the pilot record of Griilnell tennis against the
larger, more powerful outfits, and they are sure
that there is a means for continuing this record.

Grillllcll college is hardrprcssed this year, both
for motley alld for students. Yet with the reduce
(ion of expenses next year and improvement of
general economic conditions, it is hoped and ex
pectcd that this is but a temporary matter. 50
the fact remains that ill" Grinnell is to remain ill

WHAT WOULD THE PILGRIMS THINK?

by {in Ol’cl'll'ltcllllillg‘ majority, favor the addition
of Friday following Thanksgiving day to the va-

the matter to the curricullllll colllmittcc littxt w 1:

will be extended to include the entirc wccltclld.

It, is not Only the student body which favors

SUTVDAY LIBRARY
(Dilily Northwestern)

Deering library should be open to students on Suns

day afternoons and evenings. This is the sincere request

of may students on the campil‘s and it is apparent at.

once that their reasons are well founded.

From a specific group of students who are depend-
ent on outside work to offset living expenses while at»
tending college, this request is exceedingly acute. Of
this number, many find employment on Saturdays. and
are, therefore, forced to do their studying on Sundays.
The atmosphere on Sunday in their living quarto
whether fraternity, sorority or dormitory, is not par.
ticularly conducive to studying. Countless distractions
fill the air.

In an attempt to retreat from this atmosphere, the
student goes to the Evsnston Public library where he
finds posted throughout its hall numerous unwelcome
invitations. The Evanston Public library is justified in
making this exclusion of students, for, as these notices
imply, Northwestern students now have sufficient li-
brary facilities of their own.

But have they? The facilities are there, yes, but
access to them is not. By a rule of the library officials.
reserve hooks are not to be taken from the library,
Unless the students are given a chance to work in the
library where the books are, this ruling seriously ques-
tions the value of having reserve books at all, We do
have an excellent library here on the campus. why not
make its use available to all the students at all times?

In view of these facts. therefore. we feel justified
in making the request that Deering library be open
Sunday afternoons and evenings. Why make the al-
ready difficult task of securing an education even more
difficult for these working Students?

But by no means do we make this request in den
tense of the working student alone. We are sure that
there aremany others who would welcome an increased
number of study hours per week.

SYSTEM NEEDED
(Oklahoma Dnily)

Frill page advertisements of hard liquor and wines
have appeared in five of the leading newspapers of
New York City recently and a national advertising
agency is preparing copy for immediate distribution to
newspapers all over the country, says the current issue
of Editors and Publishers. So with the repeal of the pro—
hibition amendment within the next few months a virtual
certainty, a determined campaign to quench a thirst
of a theoretical duration of 14 years is already under
way.

The nation is now faced with a problem just as
perplexing as that which it is about to dispose of, that
of the proper distribution of the alcoholic beverages
which it is about to legalize. This problem becomes
complicated when we consider that the system which
the nation had in effect before prohibition was highly
inefficient and that nothing has been done since then
to improve it. Furthermore, with the liquor question
being handled by different methods in different states
many of the vils which compare favorably with those
of the prohi on era are bound to come back.

If the repealist is to reap the reward for the work
he has accomplished in the past few years he must see
to it that a distribution system is worked out which will
not bring back the excesses which caused the adoption
of the 15th amendment.

FORMAL COURSE SAVES
(Minnesota Daily)

The University of Wisconsin, which has made the
name of Madison a symbol of liberalism in education,
is to offer its student body a course in debunking. It
is rather amusing, in view of Wisconsin's reputation
as a university willing to espouse the minority View»
pont, that the university dons should find it necessary
to subject their students to any further exploding of
popular fallacies, At Wisconsm, and for that matter at
our own university, the student of liberal arts changes
his ideas pretty swiftly without the old of any course
devoted exclusively to blasting myths.

But Wisconsin, apparently, is not taking any
chance, Their course will make it possible for students
to learn the folly of “Buy American" without taking a
course in economics, or to find out that Germany is
not solely responsible for the World war without taking
a history course.

To find out. than an oltl, common idea is entirely
mistaken is a stimulating spiiitual experience, Once the
discovery is made, the student should have the pleasure
of playing the debunker, by bringing the word to his
acquaintances who have not yet seen the light. But the
best part of the whole experience is that the student
has to do a little digging himself in order that his
ideas may undergo the change which comes with a
college education. To set up the fallacies in wholesale
antity and then knock them down while the student
alts by find watches smacks much of prodigestiou.

“Nations used to try to get. to—
gether but now they are trying to
be Self-Sufficient," began Prof. Earl
D. strong in his chapel address. “This
new trend has developed since the
great World war. There is an intense
national feeling and now in the den
pression we see it at its highest wave.
Each country is pushing its own in-
dustries with an attempt to suppress
unemployment.

“The result in this case is sggres»
sion, defense, and retaliation,” he

continued, “but we cannot do this in-

every case, as we lack the raw ma—
tcriztls to support us in case of an
economic isolation. If we succeed in

becoming independent we will be uu- :
able to collect debts and we will lose ,

foreign markets."
