HIS MEMORY WILL REMAIN

With the death of Henry W. Matlack last
Thursday, there passed a man who by his
constant devotion to Grinnell college and
hls adherence to the ideals which make this
college what it is, had become himself a
tradltion of the school. /

~Mr. Matlack, who for 29 years served
Grlnnell as an instructor, assistant to the
president, and editor, gave unstintingly of
hrs tlme and energies in order that Gl'innell
might be a better school. No task was too
gl‘eat‘for him to attempt, no favor too small
for him to bother with.

As a result, Ml Matlack became a loved
and respected figure throughout the cam»
pus. His pupils and his associates came to
know hlm as a man of infinite patience,
kindllness and gentleness Thelc can be no
better key to his character and personality
than the respect in which he was held.

. Although this loved and respected figure
Wlll appear on the campus no longer, his
memory will be mtained and the devotion
whlch he held for Grinnell will be remern~
bered as long as this college exists when-
ever his own composition, the famous Grin-
nell marching song, “Here Come the Pi -
neers," is sung. No better monument to
him could be erected.

In all sincerity, this campus mourns the
death of Henry W, Matlack. All too few of
us have the singleness of purpose and the
devotion to an ideal which characterized
this man. His untiring efforts in the be-
half of Grinnell college have been a spur to
all his associates.

To those who survive him goes the deep~
est sympathy from every person associated
with this school.

WHAT ABOUT SMOKING ’I

There is a great deal of unnecessary in-
convenience in the matter of co—eds smoking
during open-house in the men’s dormitories.
Many of the women enjoy a cigarette during
the course of open-house. There is no par-
ticular reason why they should not be per—
mitted to smoke in the club rooms as do the
men. It seems ridiculous to leave the
comfort of a warm club-room, unearth top-
coats from a miscellaneous heap of clothing,
and hike out to the middle of MacEachron
field in order to smoke,

The League board never has had any
objection to women smoking in the club-
rooms during open house. The Council of

House Presidents once approved the idea.
then unaccountahly changed its mind. We
suggest the Council put an end to the hills
ance of walking a mile for our Camels.

Much the same problem is folmd at the
quadrangle. Cannot the women dig up a
room somewhere in the quad Where the men
can smoke? There are distinct disadvalr
tagcs in having to plow out into snow drifts,
as we did last winter, to have a cigarette
with one’s date.

Let’s have some action on this unneces-
sary problem. —F.R.S.

,4;—
FIX THE SIDEWALKS

The sidewalks on the Grinnell campus
are arranged in the most circuitous and
timesllasting routes. The most conspicuous
example is the path from the quadrangle to
the dormitories

In rainy weather or during the snow-
drift season, it is practically impossible to
use the path which goes to the north of the
men’s gymnasium. At these times one must
use the sidewalk along Park street to the Y
building and then down to the quadrangle.
Of course, these are the times when it is
pouring and the longer route is even more
inconvenient.

The need for a new cement sidewalk is
easily understood. Many of the cinder paths
around the campus can no longer be desig-
nated as such for they have become mud—
holes, and surely it would be very difficult
to fix these up.

The student body would like to see ac-
tion taken on these two projects this fall.

A TRIBUTE

In the preface to his masterpiece, Robe-
lais compares his book to an apothecary’s
jar which may be rough and rude in its ex,
terior but which harbors within it the rarest
and most precious of essences. In a way
such, a comparison might apply to our old
friend, Harry Matlack. He was a man of
positive opinions which he often expressed,
not only with force and directness but also
with a crude emphasis that might easily
offend those who did not know him well.
But beneath this often gruff exter r there
was a heart full of the finest sensibility, an
extraordinarily well furnished mind, and an
inexhaustible fund of humor as well as the
gifts of a highly competent artist.

Harry Matlack was primarily a musician,
thoroughly familiar with the history and
technique of music, a critic of rare discern—
ment, with a gift for felicitous expression,
and a knowledge of the organ that included
complete mastery of the instlument with a
mechanical command of all its mechanisms
But music was only a part of the domain
over which his mind ranged with consunr
mate ease. He knew literature. He was
familiar with the progress of science. He
followed with intelligence the development
of political and economic thoughts He was
alive to moral and religious issues. There
was something encyclopedic about his intel—
ligence, and it was always a joy to hear his
lucid and competent treatment of any topic
that might arise in conversation 01' in group
discussion.

His talk was always enlivened by a
humor that was quite orlginal and individ-
ual. It was not the humor of the ordinary
American convel'sationalist who collects
funny stories and flaunts them as borrowed
plumage. His humor was not at all of the
story—telling type. It was rather of the
nature of wit, springing from a source of
quite original experience and observation,
expressing itself in merry quips, humorous
reflections and sparkling repartee. We
shall miss and continue to miss the rare and
precious essence contained in his apathe-

cary‘s vase.

Maiden-Munchausens are in a class by them-
selves. And hcre.we had thought all along that men
were the greatest fabricators of fables and fancies.
Howeveriand this is the rub—the committee of
judges at a liar's contest staged at the University of
California, conceding that women are Sllperlor in
this sinful art, refused to let the questionably fairer
sex have the opportunity of competing against the
men. Now they have their own place in the “lie-

lng—sun." '

 

Comments
of the Readers

Dear Editor of the .Scarlet and
Black:

There are a great many stu
dents here in collegeisome mu-
sic majors or minors, and others
not connected in any way with
the music dcparlment~whu great-
ly enjoy singing, but who have
perhaps been unable to pass the
“tryouts” for the ,glee club.
Should these people have to give
up all hope of being able to train
and use their voices, 01‘ will Grin»
nell provide them with another
chance? Why not give these
students who would seriously en-
joy clioir work an opportunity to
Work together in a mixed chorus
under the direction of Mr. Hilffr
man. If it is started with en-
thusiasm, it can be worked into
a very worthwhile organization.

Lucy Sherman,

Dear Editor of the Scarlet and
Block:

There is an unfortunate, or
shall 1 say fortunate situation,
which exists on the Grinnell cam-
pus. Last week many of our
singers, both men and women,
who aspired to become members
of the men's or women's glee
clubs or the Vespers choir, sang
their little bit before those on
gsnizaticns with the faint hope
of passing the annual ”tryouts."
Of this large group only a. small
per cent were actually accepted.
And what becomes of the others?

Why, if their longing for and
need of choir training is to be
satisfied at all, they are com-
pelled to look outside of the Grins
ncll campus for such training
that the church choirs of crushed
can offer. Of course this is an
unfortunate situation for public
school music majors, who do not
make the “tryouts," and who are
compelled to have one year of
choir experience. But this is not
all; Grinnell college has in the
person of Mr. Huffman a man
who has had excellent experience
with a cappella choirs and is more
than willing to give of his time
and talent if the college will give
him the opportunity. There is
the situation, and what is the wi .
and logical outcome? Why, an
other choir on the campus, of
course.

House Presidents
Learn Proper
Care of Furniture

Placing and care of the club
room furniture and care of the
floors in the men’s dormitory
were discussed by Fred L. Harts
zook, interior decorator from
Younker Brothers in Des Moines,
at tho Council of House Presi-
Llellts' meeting, Thursday evening.
“Care of the clubrcoin furniture
in the men’s halls should be made
a tradition," he stated, “and it
should be treated the same as fur.
nitiirc at home. It is up to the
lcadere in the hall to see that this
is clone.”

A special meeting early next
week was decided upon to discuss
pcp plans with John Spence, chair-
man of the pep committee. It was
also decided to continue Sllbscl‘lpr
tions to the “New Yorker” and
the “Literary Digest," for Dean
Beatty's office.
