Texan Invenls New Racket;

Poses as 'Son in Dislress’

LOS ANGmS, Calif., Oct. 19.—
A broad accent does not go well with
a Texas prison record.

Nor do five aliases, all “juniors,"
beflt any man.

And if that were not enough,asuit..
case full. of college annals of the
1390s is a curious possession.

These factors and an assertedly Com~
pleto confession brought five counts
of petty theft today against C. R,
Emidy, 27, who allegedly obtained
“loans” from wealthy college alumni
as the “son-in.distress" of their old
classmates.

Emldy chose alumni of Boston Tech
in four instances, of Purdue in a fifth,
according to J. A. Winn and L. R.
Yarrow, investigators for the district
attorney’s office, and according to a
complaint filed by Deputy District
attorney John Barrie Here is what
they say Emidy d'

Posed as Warren Priest, Jr., son of
a Boston Tech grad, to c. S. Millikan,
of 970 New York avenue, Altildena,
and obtained $15.

Posed as Francis A. J. Fitzgerald,
Jr., son of another graduate of Boston
Tech, to M. L. Fish, of Pasadena, and
get $5.

Posed as Forest E. Stevens, In, to
Charles D. Lathrop, of Pasadena. Net
result, a little touch of $15.

Posed as Percy Holden, .Tr., to G.
c. Davis, San Marine, and was obliged
to the extent of $20.

Posed is James N. Dresser, .Tr., son
of a Purdue grad, to Dr. Laird J.

acy of the University of Southern Cal.

investigators Winn and Yarrow said
Emidy confessed to all the above in
a bored manner and with a “broad
a” accent. They declared he served a

 

prison term in Texas for forgery.
