Student recommendation for a. college . twice
as valuable as tllat pronounced by public, relations
workers or printed public , We do not mean to
say that the, latter methods are unnecessary. for
they must be used to create interest ill a new field,
and to supplement st-udcnt recommendation ill a
sectiolrwhel'e high school pupils are already famil-
iar with the college.

Yet, this student recommendation must Iw
forthcoming to aid {ii-ililloll college ill building; up
it larger student body [or next year. High school
sclliors this fall are already deciding where. they
will lllatricultlte for their college education, The
Thanksgiving perio’d. ill the past. provided a few
days ill which college studcnisiparticularly fre he
men and sophomores l'sited with their former
high school friends, including those who were s ill
attending high school alld those wllo u ere workil
or staying at home. With the one-day Thlillksgi
int: vacation in effect this year, only the Christmas
holidays are left in which to make such contacts,
and studellts lnust work that much harder.

Regardless of dissensioll. students as a group
are loyal backers of their school. Now is the time
to think about “selling” the idea of entering Grille
hell to former high school friends and other into
osted persons. Organization of: groups from vari-
ous communities will be necessary, but there is ev-
ery reason to believe, that with the reduction ill exe
penscs here, and considering the high scholastic
standing of Grillncll, enrollment can be increased

by more than 100 students next fall.

CLASSIFICATION

It is easy for human intelligence to group luau-
kind in two directly opposed or contrasting classes.
It makes the act of thinking less complex and it
gives a luau a tangible group ill which to place
himself. These classes may be economic, social,
political, religious, geographical, racial. moral.
mental, or imaginary.

For instance, there are Bourgeois alld Prolo-
tariat classes with both economic and social impli-
cations. Capital and labor inlply similar (1 '
tions. Then, too, there are militarists and pacifists,
as well as sub-groups ostensibly under the heading
of pacifism—those who believe ill preparedness and
those who bclicvo in disarlilament. Running hur-
riedly through the list. with no attempt at thor-
oughly covering the field, we find farmers and ur-
hanites, blue-shirt and white collar worke- wets
and drys, interlintiollalists and nationalists, extme
verts and introvcrts Catholics and Protestants,
whites and black Nordics and Semitics, conserva-
tives and radica ——thcre is no end to them.

The point is this, however. The intolerant per»
son thinks only of one set of those classifications.
He is on one side, with part of humanity, and all
else is on the other side, But how about these other
groups, which overlap his group and which give
every thinking person several things ili common?
Human beings will be able to understand one our
other more thoroughly when they begin to realize
this fact.

PROBATION DAYS

Freshman probation days are here today, gollc
lotilﬂl'row. Theoretically. WC suppose, their pur-
pose is to discipline the freshmen and provide
amusement for the entire st dent body. Practice
ally, the theory holds true in some cases. bllt not
ill all.

There are many uppel-elassmeu who look back
to those, probation days as an exciting and illtcrr
osting happening in their early college life, and
for this reason, like to see their continuance. Otltr
crs are not interested, and some are violently ope
posed.

if» such a period does prolidc amusement for
the entire student body, if it is constructive ill dis-
ciplining the fl' lunch, and if it is not merely an
excuse for a scl of stupid practical jokes or the
carrying out of personal grlldg'esithen it is Wol‘lllr

CHAMPIONS AGAIN
(Daily 0' Collegian)

The Aggies made a trip to Creighton this weekend
to decide the 1933 championship of their conference. In
spite of stories that a hard battle faced the locals, the
Punchers ran up five tallies in quick succession, placed
the second string in the field for a little practice, and
when the Jays scored twice, placed the regulars back
in to hold the opponents until the game ended.

And so, after two games, championship of the Mis
souri Valley comes back again to Aggieland It sounds
well, but it has come to be regarded as little honor for
Waldorf's men. The Aggies play a better brand of foot-
ball tban is normal for the Missouri valley, and do not
point to conference games. In spite of the ballyhoo, Val»
ley games are usually considered safe, and the cham-
pionship a. matter of course. A. and M. is the only ma
jor state school in the conference, which is loose and
widely scattered,

It isn’t particularly good for the Missouri Valley to
be dominated by one school—a school which does not
point to conference tilts—and it is little honor for A.
and M. to win the Valley,

There is no reason why concerted efforts should not
be made to enter some other conference. The Aggies
consistently have a team up to Big Six caliber, and if
entrance there is impossible, we might go south.

With pretty definite assurance of an improved
highway north to Ponca City and pavement to Tulsa and
Oklahoma city, stillwater should be able to draw crowds
suffiicent to merit better known teams on the home
gridiron.

THE CAMBRIDGE CLOWNS
(The Creightonian)

The two Cambridge debaters who. Monday night
met a Creighton team were ”delightfully foreign" gene
tlemen. As such they caused the fluttering of several
co—ed hearts and made themselves objects of consider-
able comment to others. As debaters many felt they
might learn a great deal from Mr. Gleason and Mr.
Springborg. The debate was all-in—all a veiy good one
due mostly to the instinctive and at the same time in-
teresting information given by Creighton's negative
team.

The attitude of the two young Englishmen as dem-
onstrated in their speeches indicated that: they had not
expected a serious audience, And, as the Creighton dc»
bater charged, they were undeniably guilty of attempts
ing to entertain the audience rather than inform it. It
would seem that the young Britishers had been in~
structed to please the barbarous Americans either by
making them laugh or by shocking them with illrman-
nered personal thrusts aimed at their opponents.

The Omaha audience laughed at the jokes politely
and gasped at the personal vituperation all as the gen-
tlemen from Cambridge desired. .But the judges voted
for Creighton and there is little reason to doubt that the
result would have been much the same according to an
audience decision. As Gleason suggested in his closing
argument, “Be entertained by them; be convinced by
US.”

As it happened Creighton’s two debaters did on effi.
cient job of convincing and their discussions were not
at all uninteresting.

Thursday

Dorr Yeager, ’26. member of the
National Park service, author and
journalist, spoke in chapel Thursday
on the conservation of American big-
game.

“The average person's conception
of conservation," said Mr. Yeager, “is
that it deals with the planting and
saving of trees," He explained its
wider scopeithat of caring for wild
animals, and preserving them in their
natural haunts.

He continued to point out that
there were two blots on the pages
of American history; the treatment
of the American Indian, and the
ruthless slaughter of American game.
In a direct challenge to students to
interest themselves in preserving
America's heritage he concluded,
“American wild life needs friends.
Back the organizations which are at-
tempting to conserve wild life for
posterity."
