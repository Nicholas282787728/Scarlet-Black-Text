IS THIS FREEDOM?

The recent arrest and later release on bond
of Evelyn: John Strachey; British author and lec—
turcr on social and Economic problems, on, the
clxa c5 of advocating the overthrow of the United
States government seems to be a bold attempt to
frustrate the right of freedom of speech and
thought. ’

The action of the government in attempting
to deport Strachey is difficult to understand.
Nominally the charge is that he advocates the
overthrow of the present government by means
of force, but in the light of the average Americans
belief in the sanctity of the present government,
this so—called danger assumes a decidely trivial
aspect.

In comparison with some of the wild state-
ments made by some American demagogues,
Strachey’s remarks lose much of their sorcalled
dangerousness. He has been engaged in lectur-
ing on the relative merits of Fascism and Com—
munism and not in advocating any doctrines for

the American people to follow in politics.

Contrast this with me violent bombast of
Huey Long in his “share-therwealth" program
or the blasts which Father Coughlin has unloosed
. re and again against the “money changers”.
Both of these men have made statements for
more radical than any that Strachey is reputed to
have made. In addition not only have Long and
Coughlin mode radical statements, but they also
have built up a iollcwing and an influence which
to is has been very potent. Witness the recent
rejection of the World Court measure in answer
to the attack of Ccughlin and Long on the pro-
posal. Certainly these two are potentially more
dangerous to the government than socchey; yet
no attempt is made to deport them.

Perhaps his recent entry into the United
States was illegal technically, but the recent ac-
tion over such a trivial matter has all the ”ear—
marks” cl an attempt to suppress the freedom of
speech and thought in this country, or at least be»
ing a step in that direction. For it is only as such
that the attempt can be construed.

America has prided herself on being a demo»
cratic country and has insistedsstrongly upon the
right of the individual to freedom of speech and
thought; yet this tradition in itself is not sufficient
unless it is adequately carried out. And by no
means can the deportation of Strachey be inter
preted to mean that the freedom of speech and
thought are still in force. More'than lip service
to this ideal is necessary, or else all freedom will
have vanished. —M, H.

A CROSS ROADS

The pressure of lobbyists is once
sorting itself on Capitol Hill, recent dispatches
:zzvcal. In a spccisl article in the New York
Times dealing with lobbying, it was brought out
that ihc lobbyists again were becoming more and
lilorc powerful, although in a different manner.

To the majority of the people of the United
{ totes the widespread ramifications of the lobby:

now and then a Senatorial investigating committ—
l u will bring something to light, as happened in the
investigation of the awarding of Army contracts,

t 'cly protected the private interest, but as a l'e~
on t' hindered the really effective means of carry-
i ; our government. Such was the situation

ring the ’1wenties,

Vllith the advent of the New Deal unexpected
developments took place. The lobbyists found
that so many new authorities had been created

,tions, for the full development of

that it was impossible to exert any meal control,
and hcnce they adopted an attitude of waiting and
gradually rebuilding their contracts. Thus for
the last two years they have been waiting. They
have been waiting until some of the first enthus-
iasm for the new administration had evaporated,
and now the time is ripe for them to regain their
old domination.

Congress is in a rebellious mood, the popu-
larity of the New Deal is in partial eclipse, and
the lobbyists are again emerging from their re»
treats. With this emergence, their appears thc
specter of an invisible government run for lhc
wishes of a few, and a seliish icw at that.

The people of the country are at a cross»
roads. For two years the government has prob—
obly been freer from lobbying inﬂuences than at
any time. But now the question is, do the pco»
ple want the lobbyists to regain power? Obs
viously it is to the disadvantage of the people to
have such a situation come about, but unles:
some action is taken to curb the influence of the
lobbyists, reorganizing that they exceed the bounds
of good government, the return to a modified sys-
tem of the pro-depression lobbying is likely to
happen. The result will be that the efficiency
of the representative government will be serious~
1y impaired. The decision is before the people.
“To be or not to be?” The people must decide
for themselves whether or not they will counten-
ance the return to the old lobbyist system, and
upon their decision depends the success 0'
representative government. ——M. H.

TO THE SWIMMERS!

Tonight the varsity swimming team will bring
to a close the home schedule and will all but con»
cluded the 1934-35 season. Grinnell has up:
doubtedly undergone an athletic depression, and
this has been felt as keenly in the swimming field
as in the other lines of varsity competition. And
in this field, like in the others, the players have
had to make a game fight against stiff competi-
tion.

In spite of this fact, the swimmers have con-
tinued to work and have set their share of new
records. Now with the dawn of a brighter athletic
day, much of the past will be forgotten. There is,
however, one part which should not be relegated
to memory without a bit of a thought, and that is
the efforts of the varsity swimmers, during the
past two years, to carry on.

To these men, engaging in a sport which
neither draws the crowds nor the plaudits of it as
the other spans do, a bit of a toast is due. It
takes grit to get out there and battle time and
again when you are outclassed. So here's to the
swimmers who have carried on. ~M. H.

GRINNELL‘S FUTURE

Dr. Walter A. Jessup, president of the Carne-
gie Foundation for the Advancement of Teach—
ing, in his recent report, predicted an imminent
struggle for survival among American colleges.
What Dr. Jessup was predicting was the severest
phase of this struggle, which is to come. This
struggle, however, has been developing for sever-
al decades and has been intensified by the present
depression.

During the nineteenth century in this coun—
try, institutions of higher learning sprang up will.
a mushroom-like growth, especially here in the
middle west. Most of these colleges enjoyed a
brief period of prosperity and influence and thci:
lapsed into a bare existence, as large universitie
and statessupported institutions gained
strength. Few of them have been able to keep
up with the trends of the times in education.
Equipment which was once excellent became antls
quatecl, and the money was lacking to replace it.
Faculties have shrunk, and salaries have been
seriously cut. During the last two decades, a
number of these small denominational colleges
have had to close because they were unable to
offer students the advantages which might be
found in a larger school. Many more are facing
the same situation today because of reduced stu»
dent bodies, the lack of contributions from alum-
ni, and reduced incomes from endowment. With
a few more years of economic depression, many
more of these institutions will have to close
doors.

These numerous small colleges have served
their purpose well in bringing higher education
within the range of a very large number of poo»
ple—in making the American people college-con»
scious. But they are no longer equipped to give
the full advantages of education. They
offer the same opportunities as the

both in mind and body. The small, poorly—

cquipped colleges are not competent to carry on ,
They must ,'
better staffed, and better

the business of higher education.
givc away to the larger,
equipped schools.

Though Grinnell is much better fitted. to I

come out on top, than most small colleges in this
struggle ior existence, it too faces much competi»
tion and must adequately prepare to overcome
this competition. There are many

ments which must he made. These improve~

inents must not he put off as dreams of the future, '1

for this is the critical period. It is now that we
must establish our definite superiority. It is
now, when the tendency to lag behind is strongest

CZklAlDEEL
NCDT'EES

Dr. Henry S. Canard. professor of
botany. spoke in chapel this week on
the differences between "knowing and
doing." He used the motto of Johns
Hopkins university, “The truth shall
make you free." to point out that the
search for u'uth is also the search [or
freedom.

He then showed that there is much
doing in which little knowing is in.
volved, as well as considerable l-Lnow—
ing in which little doing is considered.

“In class rooms," the speaker stated,
“knowing is emphuizcd rather than
doing, and this may possibly be a dcw
fect in the present educational sys.
tem.” The questions, “Is education
worth while?” and “Do we do as we
know?" were discussed.

“ ‘Knowing' and ‘doing’ are closely
related," the speaker coniinued, "im-
doing necessarily follows knowing.
Radio and automobile expenditures, for
example, follow every new creation of
the product put out on the market.
When something new and su ”Vie-ill
is created we 'knowY about it E‘
ceed to ‘do’ on that knowled
our actions are based on knowledge”

“However," the speaker asked, “what
do we know about those things which
are harmful, and why don’t we follow
that knowledge? We know that oer—
toin Lhings and certain activities will
be harmful to us, but do we always
act wisely upon that knowledge?"

“Knowledge keeps pace with prcc.
tice and practice
knowledge in life,” Dr. Canard explain.
ed. "Choices and values are largely
composed of stimuli and drives. But.
no line activity comes without know.
ledge and practice. Knowledge is put
into practice, and from this we learn
more step by step. Although the two
altemate and intermingle constantly

a wide gap between knowing and dc.
ing." the speaker concluded.
