THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

 

By MAX ltoss

The dawn of a new football season
will see the return of 12 lettermen to
form a nucleus for the 1932 football
squad. At present the squad has such
potential strength that even in view
of the lack of experience only optim-
ism prevails. a number of valuable
reserves and freshmen will gladden
the hearts of Coaches Watt and Duke,
who are faced with the difficult task
of whipping a team into shape in the
short space of two weeks.

e r s

Peculiarly enough, Doc Huff, the
only other Grinneil man to punicl~
pate " an Olympic Games mrnlx‘al,
is going west with Coach Duke to
see Morgan Taylor bi action Huff
coached Taylor when the latter was
at Grinneu in 1923. 24, and 25. Huff,
himself one of Grim-211's greatest
sprinters, represented the United
Suites in London in'lsos. He is now
head track coach at the University

of Missouri.

«to

Duke is somewhat chagrined at
the failure of Brocksmith and others
to run in the longer 5000 and 10000
meter races in the final Olympic Lry~
outs, thus allowing men of inferior
ability to gain places on the team.
At present the U S. is conceded lit-
tle chance to win in these events.

s a x

If it had been knoun in ndinnce
that Brocksmith and others were to
stay out of the 5000—meter race, Mike
Pllbl'ow would in all probability have
been trained for that event. Duke
figures that Pilhrow, who relies en.
tireiy on a judgment of pace, could
turn the distance in 15 minutes with-
out difficulty, The race was won in
14:55. so Pilbrou- could have quali—

ﬁled for a place on the team easily.

who played all the positions on the
line with the fresh last season, may
oust him.
Must Replace Thomas

The backfield lacks an outstanding
star, such as Thomas was last year.
But at the start of the 1931 season,

In all probability the opening pride»
tice session Of the 1932 football squad
will be held September 10. A Missouri
Valley regulation prohibits practice
before that date, but the Pioneers
have a game scheduled with Palm
college Septembcr 23 or 24, so it will
be necessary to utilize every possible
moment.

Two weeks will not give coach
Lester 1:. (Fuzz) Watt long to whip
his men into shape for the Penn en-
counter, especially since he will have
a wealth of valuable material to Se~
lect his team from. Twelve lettermen
return for service, and in addition.
there are a number of reserves and
members of last year's freshman
squad who are almost certain to find
their way into the lineup. Although
Coach Watt will have many
veterans on hand, he will not have
a highly season team.

Duncan a star Last Season
Returning wingmen are Frank Dun-
can and Bob McKee, who will be glv~
en a battle for their positions by Dick
Phelps, Harold Anderson, and Miller
Brown, promising sophomores, and
Bill Welsh and Willis crews. re~
serves. Duncan, playing his first
season of football of any kind last
year, developed so rapidly that at the
end of the year See Taylor, Des
Moines sports editor, proclaimed him
to be the best end in the state. So
adept was be at catching passes that
he acquired a sufficient number of
points scored on tuchdowns by the
aerial route that he found himself at
the top of the Missouri valley scoring
heap, Although it was his first year-
of football, Taylor picked him in pref~
erence to John Briley, Drake's out
standing all-western end, as the
leading Missouri Valley wingman.
Duncan also was awarded a berth on
the allrstate team. 1
The best of the tackle candidates:
is Howard Could. junior, who rose
from the ranks of the reserves inl
midseason, to prove his worth and
win a letter. To choose another out-
standing tackle from the rest of the
group is impossible. Bob Morgan.

chapt, who reeled off a number
long gains last year at psychological
moments, He has acquired the sea-
soning he needed, and if his defensive
work continues to improve, he may
find himself in the starting lineup.

Thomas had not risen to his peak,
and it is possible that Coach Watt
may uncover another star with the
advent of a new year. someone will
have to be found who can fill the fore
ward passing role. Watt' has always
relied strongly on an aerial attack.[
and the Pioneer success in this branch

the sport was at times equalled
e best in the middle west. Eleven

out of 15 touchdowns were scored via

e forward pass route last season.

Victor Fini will be groomed to fill
e passing role, although it may fall
the lot of Snap James. The hard-
iving Dick Ullrich will furnish the

fireworks for the running plays in the

att system.

Captain Graflund is an expert

blocking back, and is a bear on de-
fense backing up the line. His ability
and his knowledge of the game make
him a vital part of the Pioneer ma-

ine. Al Rose is the same type of

player as Craflund, big, a good block
or, and a good defensive man. With
Craflund, Flnl, U'llrich, and Rose Les

ther in the backfield, Coach Watt
11 have a veritable powerhouse.
James Dark Horse

The dark horse of the squad is

Clarence (Snap) James, who has of-
ten shown signs of reaching stardom.
'He is light on his feet, fast, shitty, a
splendid open field runner, and a vic-
ious tackler. This year may be

his
ar.

Another man who will be hard to

ep out of the lineup is Harold Alexe
der, the featherweight speed mer.

Malbrough, Chicago freshman, who
established three new school records
last winter. In only the breast-stroke
is the Pioneer team weak, but Coach
Rosen has several prospects for that
event.

Grinnell tennis teams toppled from
their lofty pinnacle when Harris
Coggeshall was graduated several
years ago. but next year should see a
turn for the better when Frank Davis

return for their third year of col-apes

McCully, and other promising fresh-
men seeking the other places on the
team.
