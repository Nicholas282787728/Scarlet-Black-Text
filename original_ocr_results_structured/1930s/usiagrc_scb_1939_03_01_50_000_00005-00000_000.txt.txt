False Siari

On Plans for
Viciory Day

Misunderstanding Is
Given As Reason for
Incorrect Rumors

The much-heralded Victory day
which didn‘t materialize was the
result of a series of misundere
standings, faculty member-s and
student leaders stated today.

John H. Harris, president of
Clark hall and the Council of
House Presidents, said that he
called Pres. John S. Nollen after
the game, asking him if he would
authorize the Victory day.
Telephones Canard.

Nollen stated that he had talked
with Henry s. Conard, chairman
of the faculty, in regard to the
matter and that all arrangements
for a Victory day were up to him.
Conard told me that he would be
willing to discuss the matter
with Robert Moehl, president of
the Student Council.

Entirely up to Conard.

“1 then called Moehl, telling
him specifically that Nolleii had
not made a decision, but had left
the question entirely up to Dr.
Conarrl.

“Afterwards, I talked wrth Mar-
garet Hale, president of the Wom-
en’s Self—Government League, and
told her of the discussion which
was to take place between Moehl
and Canard," Harris Continued,

“I understood Miss Hale to say
she had discussed possibilities of
a Victory «day with Evelyn Gard-
ner, dean of women, and that
hours were to be 11 p, m. that
night.

“There was considerable noise
and confusion around us as we
talked, and it is very possible
that we misunderstood each othr
er," Harris explained.

In an interview today, Conard
said he believed that the phone
call with Harris was a misunder-
standing by both parties.

"I understood by the conversa-
tion that permission had been giv—
en by Pres. Nollen for the Victory
day and that Harris was calling
only to ask for cooperation in
arranging a program. .

"I told him that

and see me," Conard continued.

“Previous to the conversation

Cancel Victory Day.

"After talking with Harris, I
called President Nollen, who else
sured me that no permission for
a victory day had been granted
by him.

“Taking into consideration both
the snow storm and the influenza
epidemic, I decided that it would,
in my opinion, be inadvisable to
have the event. I told the student
leaders this, assuring them that it
had never been my intention to
grant a Victory day in my cone
