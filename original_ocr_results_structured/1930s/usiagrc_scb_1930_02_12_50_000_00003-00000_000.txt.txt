‘Need Sense of
Dramatic’-Lane

‘Then Job Will be Easier,’
He Says at Special

Vesper Service.

“The romance of the other fel-
law's job is always easy to See. The
other fellow's grass is always green~
er than your own," the Rev. Mr.
Stoddard Lane. pastor of the Fly-
mouth Congregational Church of Des
Moines, said at a special Vesper
service held in Herrick chapel Tues-
day afternoon at 4:30 o'clock in
connection with the Fellowship con-
ence in session here this week.

The reason that the work of some-
one else is always more attractive to
us, he pointed out, is because we see
that job in the largHwe see only
the big, interesting things about it.
while with our job, which more often
than not we see in the small. is elut-
tered up with the little things.

The way we look at our own job
and the job of our neighbor for-ms
two very different attitudes. one
man says he has a great job and
nothing can stop him; the second
man sees so many difficulties in his
path that he is ready to quit... What
the man With narrow vision needs
and what the first one already has
is a sense of the dramatic; the ability
to link up everyday work with the
ideal for which the whole stands.

obscure the view. We sometimes
think of Christianity as an organiza-
tion and lose romance and glory of
it. the Rev. Mr. Lane ‘said. but it
makes all the difference in the world
if'you see it in the light of a great
purpose. a job doesn't have to be
big, just has to include the principles
of Christianity.

The ves’per choir presented Pro-
fessor c. Herbert Knight's cantata
“whence Men Cometh Wis-
dom." The soloists were: Miss
Pratt, contralto, and Miss Arline
Urban, soprano. At the close of the
scervice Mr: Harold Holst. instruc-
tor in voice, sang a solo.

Saturday after-noon in two of the

closest games of the season. Langan

clinched the intramural basketball
championship for this year. Al-
though one round is still left to be
played, this will have no bearing on
the final standings of the leaders as
they have a three game lead and on-

Iy two games remain Building

Four and Clark split their games,

Clark B winning 9-5 and Four piling

up a 21-5 score. Kelly Stables mov-

ed up a notch by winning a double
he‘ar'ler from Smith, the A’s 20-14, the

B quintet 19-9,

Dibble hall, had they won both of
their games from Langan, would
have found themselves in a tie for
first place. But, although they had
chance after chance to convert de~
feat into victory, the Dibbleites tail-
ed each‘ other in the crucial mom-
ents, allowing Langan to take ad-
vantage of them.

The Dibble B—Langan B game was.
considering what was at stake the
most thrilling game of ’the season.
The game was close throughout,
neither team holding more than a
four point lead at any time. Dibble
led throughout the first half but
trailed during the second period.
with only forty-three seconds left to
play in the final quarter and Langan
leading 13-14, the situation looked
bad for Dibble. But an undaunted
Dibble captain called time out and
sent in James Clark, pinch forward.
Clark immediately took the ball in
the center of the floor and arched a
beautiful shot which dropped clean-
ly through the net. Score: Langan
15. Dibble 16, with twenty two sec-
onds to go. Clark again shot from
an almost impossible distance to
cage the ball for another two points
to tie the score at 18-18.

in the over time period which fol-
lowed, Langan refused to admit de-
feat, and in sheer defiance of the few
seconds of play left, broke through a
weakening Dibble detense for two
scores to win the game 22-18.

Figures Show
How Freshmen
Use Time Here

Study is still more important than
recreation in the program of the av-
erage Grinnell college freshman, it
was revealed here today by the re-
sults of a study made by the depart-
ment of personnel.

The average freshman devotes
nearly six hours a day to study and
class attendance, and only four and
a half hours to recreation and athle-
tics, the results of the questionnaire
showed. The freshman spends two
hours a day at meals, and somewhat
less than eight hours in sleep. ‘Three
quarters of an hour a day goes to
literary pursuitsﬁpresumably includ-
ing the writing of letters—and about
half an hour to religious and musical
activities.

Although the average time for out-
side work is only one and a half
hours, many students work for sev-
eral times this length of time, the
average for the entire class being
pulled down by the considerable
number who do not need to work for
a living.

Briggs, hero of a previous overtime
game. repeated his stunt by caging
the ball for the first overtime score.
McCurdy Scores 11 Points

But for McCurdy, Langan's hot
shot, the game would have gone the
other way. He personally accounted
for 11 points and was the main cog
in all of Two’s attacks. Heldridge.
stellar performer for Dibble, played
a fine floor game for the losers,

The A game between these two
contenders for intramural honors
was another as far as scores go. The
game itself was comparatively slow.
Dibble led through the most part of
the game but “Jibby” Jones, lanky
Langan center, coming out of a
slump in the last few minutes of the
game, sank three long shots to give
Langan the game 10-7.
. Four and Clark Split

Building Four trampled Clark's A
team, 21-5, but achieved little glory
in accomplishing it, Clark having
lost six of their first strring men to
the track squad. The B game was
a‘ different story and Clark came out
on top, 9-5. Rose and Holmes play-
ed the best games for Five.

in spite of the fact that Kelly
Stables has lost two of their star

culty in handling the Smith hall ball-

Costumes and Dances of Colonial Days
Will Make Appearance on February 22

With the advent of Washington‘s
birthday, the minds and hearts of
the Grinnell co-eds are filled with the
thought of the Colonial Ball. This
annual affair. which will take place
on the evening of February 22nd, is
the outgrowth of an old practice
started as an entertainment for w.
A A. members only and has grown to
include all Grinnell girls.

0n the evening of the ball the
clock is turned back more than one
hundred years and gay laughing
Martha’s and jolly George's frolic
about, forgetting the work-a-day
world of today. Long full-hooped
skirts, basque waists, powdered
wigs, swallow-tail coats and picture
hats all make their appearance. All
cares are thrown aside and old-gash-
jailed gallants lead their joyous lad-
ies in the Virginia Ree]. the rye
waltz. and the lovely firefly waltz,
which is the concluding number.

whether this will be continued at
Grinnell or not is. of course. uncer-
tain. Joe Hohn, who tops Meyer by
an inch, may serve as center if call-
ed upon. also. Guards include Jah-
lonsky. Litchenfeldt, Duncan and
Wientge while the string-of forwards
playing for Washington includes
Laughlin, Saussele, Constance and
noughtlin.

The Grinnell lineup will probably
be the usual one, with DeLong and
Ruff at the forwards, Humphrey at
center and Douglas and McCreary at
guards. The injuries which have
been slowing up the squad are im-
proving and the entire quintet has
shown more speed in practice this
week than has been the custom since
before the holiday season.

beavers their eighth consecutive de-
feat, 20-14. At the end of the third
quarter the score was tied at 14-14,
but Mcintire and Aillison were good
for three more baskets and to them
went the game. For Smith. the only
man who really played basketball
was Spencer, who looped the ball for
ten points besides playing a fast of.
fensive game.
