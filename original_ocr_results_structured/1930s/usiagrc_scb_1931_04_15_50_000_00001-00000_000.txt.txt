President’s Religion Topic
of Lavell’s Talk
at Vespers

“A clear, unshakahle conviction of
faith, a belief in God's creative power
and purpose, and in Christ‘s plan for
living were the foundations for Presi-
dent Majn's religion,” said Cecil F.
Lavell, professor of history of
thought in vespers Sunday,

Having found a faith in divine
power. President Main adopted it,
never doubting throughout his life
the reality of God nor the redeeming
spirit of Christ.

Bcllcf Stronglhcncd

While President Main was intensec

ly interested in the new interpreta-

faith, his belief in a cosmic order and
in the existence of God was deepened
and strengthened rather than shattera
ed by the questionings of such men
as Milliken and Whitehead.

Nor did he study the viewpoints of
contemporary thinkers, Mr. Lavell
explained. to gain assurance, for his
was a faith without the least per—
plcxity or doubt. God was intensiﬁed,
not obscured, by the discoveries of
science and philosophy,

No Distinctions

President Main could not under
stand the distinctions of creed; he
had no interest in the hair~Splitting
differentiations of dogma.

“President Main’s llfc was full of
problems," Mr. Lavell said in closing,
“but in his life God and Christ were
not problems, but actors. His belief
in them came not from the Bible but
from experience."
