Physics Staff Tells
of Famous Clock

present system with its "master"
clock and “regulator" clock in Good
now hall, the bells and “secondary"
clocks in other college buildings, and
reasons for the present inaccuracy,
including susceptibility to changes in
temperature, the underground wiring
system, and the necessity at times of
operating the entire system manually
instead of mechanically.

“For the ‘Physics Open House last
year, ‘Seth Thomas No. 12' was rc-
vived and moved mto the physics of-
fice. It has been adjusted periodi-
cally since, and now runs within five
seconds a week of true time. The lo—
cal Western Union otfice has kindly
allowed us to listen over the tele-
phone to the standard time signals
which they receive at 11 a, m. each
day, and by this means the regulator
can readily he checked to the exact
second . . . .

Electrically Operated

“at the end of the sixtieth second
of each minute, the master clock
makes a contact, causing an elec-
trical impulse to be transmitted to
each one of the secondary mocks.‘
These are not truly clocks at all, but
simply dials, in which an electromag-
net causes the hands to move up one
minute each time the transmitted im»
pulse is received. The distributing
wires are run underground, subject
to moisture, etc., and the dials them-
selves are old, so that they do not
always ‘step’ properly, and they must
then he reset by hand when their
inaccuracy is reported."

other agents which may cause the
class hells to ring improperly, accord
ing to Grant 0. Gale, head of the
physics department, include the
notched paper tape which may break
within the master clock, the maze of
wiring from the three sets of storage
batteries which must be charged at
least once a week, and the changing
of class schedules which necessitate
a change from the mechanical oper—
ation to manual. ,

Physics staff Responsible

"This duty falls to the physics de—
partment staff, and it can be readily
understood that it is extremely dif-
ficult for someone to he at the
switch at exactly the proper time for

‘ing schedule, and still keep track of

the many details of department roue
tine which demand attention whether,
the college is on a special schedule or;
not." i

Visitors are invited to inspect thc'i
historic Seth Thomas clocks in Gootlr
now hall, according to Mr. Gale

Defeat Smithl

Northenders Annex Replay;
Last Night, 18 to 10

Dibble's class A cagers decisively‘
demonstrated their disputed superh-
ority over Smith last night, subduing
the southendcrs by a 18-10 count, in
a replay of their first round contest.
The game had been played previously,
but the resulting Smith victory was‘
protested by the Dibble outfit and
the protest was allowed by the intra—
mural board. i

Early in the tilt the winners hroke
into the lead, and by half time were
ahead 8 to 3. The final half was more
closely contested, Dihhle outscoring
its opponent by a three-point margin,
10 to 7, to earn a 18-10 victory,

Boardman, alleged producer of the
disputed basket in the first game,
was high scorer with a total ot eight
points. He was followed by Hemp-
hill, also of Dibble, and Bley of Smith ‘
who accounted for six apiece. Mat—
vey was the key man in the victors‘
defense, while Carlson's floor
was outstanding for Smith.

On Friday afternoon the secondl
round of the intramural tournament
will get underway when the Kelly A
and B quintets clash with Langan.

Saturday morning the undefeated
outfits representing Gates and Dibr
his will meet in two hattles which
may have considerable bearing on the
championship race. In the afternoon
Clark will attempt to keep its slate
clean when it opposes the Smith A
and B aggregations.
