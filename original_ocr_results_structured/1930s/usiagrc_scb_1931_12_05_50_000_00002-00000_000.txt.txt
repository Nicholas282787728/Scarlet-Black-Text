WHY COMPARE?

Norman Foerster. who lectured here last night,
remarked at a reception in the quadrangle follow-
ing the address that although he hall neither seen
nor read Eugene ‘O‘Neill’s latest play, ”Mourning
Beeonles Electra,” h‘ impression from the l- icws
was tllat it was further proof of O’Neill’s ability as
a playwriglt and his [Allure as a dramati .

Ill explaining his view, Mr. Focrstcr pointed to
a certain selltiinentulisln which is fundamental in
O’Neill and definite touches of the twentieth cen-
tury thought which he cannot lose—and which will
keep hhn from writing plays to compare witll those
of the ancients. In other words, the age ill which
O’Xeill lives prevents him from ranking with the
famous of the past.

To the cynic, however, it is barely po ible that
the great American dramatist has no desire to rank
with the ancients. Perhaps he is merely trying to
be the prophet of the great god of AIDCI‘ICOIISi
something different. After all, for what other
reason can the publishers assure the world that the
Strange Interlude “has had the largest, sale of ally
single play in book form in history?”

In “Mourning Becomes Electra,” he has ill-
vitcd comparison with Sophocles and Euripides,
who do not trouble the diner an playrgoer very
much, and, while O'Neill might suffer from that
comparison, tllc'fellow with enough money to buy
the best seats as a rule isn‘t capable of making that
comparison. That fellow spends six hours at the
Theater Guild, gaining the privilege by parting
with just that many greenbacks, alld he does it
simply for the novelty of it, with a possible hope
that it will stump him as all intellectual.

Students of the ancients will recall the adult—

T'I-IANKING MR. CHASE

IImlevor one may feel about the general hale
{\Ilt‘t‘ sheet drawn up by Stuart Chase recently in
[lei-rick rlvapel, or whatever may he thought of his
opinions on modern (‘iVIl/uliilill and society, one
at the same time, welcome the stand uhirh he
on certain features of modern busine Mr,
(hair is not a more theorist when he speaks of Ills
dustr) nl Anlel for he has llﬂtl experienoe ill

this particular llcld, and that not eonl’ined to one ,

alone. but including many. Moreover, he has nnins
ed a quantity of cts rlnr iv the years (if his (-oll-
nection with business whi ‘11 should he of interest
to the pulllii‘, ninl innny of those facts, ii‘ generally
lnnin-n, might serve to diminish a few ideas about
the glo ies of the practice 01' business ill this
country.

The use of lligllrpressurc advertising is one
phase, of activity which M Chase denounces, and
who will deny that he is ju.tificd ill doing so?
Some may say that this sort of advertising is cer-
tainly allowable so long as it is effective, and

if fools fall for it that is not the fault of the ads ‘
,vcrtisers. This is probably true. but llr. Chase
I consciousness to the '

is merely trying to a '
ill use of modern advertising. and this is assuredly
a worthy endeavor. After all, Ballylloo is not the
radical magazine it is often thought to be. Many of
its parodies are merely L“ ﬁgurations of advert
Inents already ridiculou

The address made by 111'. Chase should be ape
preciatetl by all Grinnellialls who heard it, since
all of the information given in regard to this ])a'
ticular aspect was to the student’s advantageilt
was for his enlightenment that such a speech was
given. Grinllellians constitute part of the outside
public, and the. were given valuable information
concerning business on and methods.

I am of the opinion that a stupid servant is
worse than a wicked one, or at any rate more
harassing; one can he on one‘s guard against a
hnave, but not against a fool—Jacques Casanova.
