THE GBINNELI. SLOW-DOWN

Labor‘s newest weapon, as demonstrated in
solne Michigan automobile factories, is the
production slow-down. Production is not
stopped during this type of strike, but is
merely slowed down by men ill key positions
ulitil a settlement is reached

We have had for some time a kind of
sloundown right here on the campus. It has
been practiced in the distribution of grade
reports to the students. This condition, as
we have said, is nothing new or staltling
here at Grinnell. It seems to be part of the
established ordcr of things for grades to
come out ally time from two weeks to a
mollth after the registrar’s deadline. We
are of the opinion that this delay is a very
unnecessary inconvenience to the student
body as a whole, and that it detracts greatly
from the value of the grading system.

The main cause of the slow distribution
of grade reports to the students is found in
the [act that some of the professors take a
long time in turning in their grades to the
registrar‘s office. Thus a few slow instruc-
tors hold up the grade distributing process
indefinitely by failing to turn in their
grades on the day that they are due. One
remedy for this fault in the system might
be to have each professor give out an ill-
dividual grade card to every student in each
of his classes as soon after the registrar’s
deadline as possible. He could then turn in
his usual repult to the registrar, the grades
being duplicates of the ones already given
out. Thus the whole process of grade dis-
tribution would not be held up if a few pr
fessors were tardy about turning in their
marks.

The easier remedy would be to have all
the professors simply turn in their grades
when due, and give the registrar a chance
to get to work on them without delay. The
students should get their reports more
quickly, and could use them immediately in
planning extra study time for courses in
which they were weak.

If grades do have any value at all, they
lose much of it by being reported late, Thc
situation as it now stands is unsatisfactory,
simply because of the careless attitude of a
few people in key positions. How about
mcdying it as a step toward a better Grin-
nell?

WHERE THE WII I) TIME BLOWS

It is related that upon observing an error
in the report of the clock on the Powcshiek
County National Bank a. late Grinnell wit
once remarked, quoting Shakespeare‘s 0b-

 

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

eroli, “I know a bank where the wild Time
blows,” Certainly wild Time is to be de-
plored, whatever habitat it chooses; and
though we can perhaps ignore the Powe-
sliick County National Bank, its lions and
its clocks, we have a different matter con»
fronting us when we survey our own cum-
pus. If ever a weed scemed indigenous to
its environment, that weed is the Grinnell
wild timc.

Coming back after a summer of being
able to ignore at least a few of the problems
of time, we set our watch by the dinner bell
and hoped for the best. At least we could
depend upon knowing when breakfast was.
With ou watch giving us five minutes to go
we hur ied to our eight o’clock, slowing
down just in time to enter an utterly empty
classroom. The Classic Boll began clanging
out its supposed fivceminute warning, and
we set our watch back. When the end-of-
class buzzer rang, a little we; 'ily we turned
it up two minutes. And still when from the
depths of philosophy class we heard the
noon whistle our watch read two minutes of
twelve.

After a few weeks of this we were quite
ready to give up depending upon our watch
or any other timepiece,

Tile electric clock outside the quadrangle
dining room has come down after a long
struggle to maintain a kind of integrity. But
still the clocks thwart us. The fellow whose
girl lives in Main cuts his parting short, seee
ing that it is a minute after ten by the
grandfather clock in the corridor, and dis-
covers that the minute girl is still nowhere
in sight. The fellow whose girl lives in
Mears is meanwhile still sitting with her ill
the parlor, oblivious that when the grand-
father clock chimes ten his girl has already
incurred eight minutes—perhaps less an-
other time, and perhaps again more.

The myth of Grinnell Standard Time has
ceased to be a fit subject for professors to
be facetious about. It is time that some,
thing be done. That is, if anyone knows
what time it is.

i G
WHAT D'YA SAY? ‘

How ‘dja like to meet your profs ‘off the
(notebook) record’?

A good idea, wot? At least that seems
to be the concensus of opinion on the calli-
pus. And so, figuring that there could be
few better inadeeto-ordcr places for such in-
formal mingling than the White House, the
White House committee, acting on behalf of
the student body, has extended an invita-
tion to all members of the faculty and ad-
ministration to make use of the recreation
center.

Recognizing that our professors are pretty
good “jocs” at heart, the committee has ask—
ed them to feel free to drop in at the White
House for a coke, a game of bridge, or for
a plain ordinary chat.

And now, via these columns, the invita-
tion is extended to the students to take ad—
vantage of this opportunity to sit down aild
talk the situation over with thei instructors
or to discover how good—or rotten—they
are at cards.

Here’s your chalice, collegian, to get a
bit of education that isn’t included in the
all-inclusive feega bit that may be more
beneficial than that which is included. Alld
profs, here’s your chance to Contact your
sleepy-eyed urchins in some of their more
lucid moments.

So, faculty and students alike, why not
make use of this opportunity to acquaint
yourselves with each other’s human side? It
might be mutually beneficial.

QUOTABLE QUOTES
(By Associated Collegiate Press)

“The great need of this generation is [or a
venturesome and creative outlook on the
problems of our day. The great problems
of social adjustment and the challenge of
scientific discovery in the social as well as
the natural sciences require the same sort of
daring as the pioneer exhibited. And the
pioneer did not ask for security but a
chance, and in that spirit he wrought his
miracles of conquest.” Vanderbilt Univer-
sity’s Chancellor O. C. Carmichael believes
that security should be only the byproduct
of a wellsordered life.

And so brother stahn progresses

threatens to show up his prof.

Alter Lntw and ESLIIDILil!
comes Fiulnml in Jess'ph’s primer
of imperialism, and now, having
completed the ﬁrst two lessons
at the top of the class, the tuehr.
er's star pupil is digging into us-
signment three. All of which
brings up the question: Why?

Although News Views hasn't
been particularly chummy with
stolin lately and could scarcely
be accused of knowing the innate
most workings of his mind, we
figure there are two or three
probable explanations of the Rus
sian action.

Obviously, the primary objecs
ﬁve in the whole campaign is to
gain control of the Baltic sea
and the surrounding countries.
And undoubtedly the main reason
ﬂr Russia’s seeking this control
s to protect herself—notespecinl-
iy against present circumstances
but against eventualities.

,At present, Russia’s only ma-
jor outlet to the northern ships
ping lanes, Leningrad, is within
easy range of Finland: heavy
artillery, and the port is domi~
hated by Finnishrheld islands
the Baltic. Not that Finland
would ever threaten the Reds‘
shipping point. but it would be a
different story if these islands or
this artillery should fall into the
hands of a stronger power.

Furthermore, it’s our guess
that the Kremlin reckons -
wouldn't he a bad idea. to domi-
nate the Baltic as a counter-
threut to any ani amh' 'ons in
the Balkans oi- the Ukraine. After
all, it's hardly likely that JosEph
and Adolph are going to work
hand in hand for eternity. And
the time may come when the
Baltic region would iurnish n
windows-order base of attack
against a hostile Germany.

Especially would this be true
in the event of a Nazi victory or
even in case of a draw with a
still-powerful Germany on deck.
0n the other banrl, if Great
Britain wins, a Russia firmly
seated in the Baltic would put a
crimp in the subsequent British
dominance in Europeva state of
affairs that would hardly make
stalin weep.

Then. too, there is the question
of trntlc advantages and the
proximity to and control of val-
uable minernl and timber sup—
plies. Dilering a vast store of
lumber and iron ore, the Scandie
navian peninsula is a tempting
territorial morscl. Ami Russia,
like any other country, isn't ml-
vcrsc to gaining direct ’or indir
rent control of such resources.
Moreover. there’s money to be
mime from the “right” kind of
trade agreements with the Baltic
nations.

So now with everybody who is
anybody either too busy or too
far away to do more than
Squawk, the Communists are
making plenty of imperialistic
hay.
