. U. S. Senator Reynolds .

says: "Luckies are considerate

of my throat”

Y"Two Southern traditions are oratory
—and good tobacco. Lucky Strike
shows me how to indulge in both. For
this light smoke not only pleases my
taste but leaves my throat in condition.
Last fall in North Carolina—when 1
made over 100 speeches—I visited the
Lucky Strike factory. I believe I dis-
covered, in the Lucky Strike ‘Toasting’
process, the secret of what makes this
cigarette so considerate of my throat.
I have been'mare than ever an advo—
cate of a light smoke since seeing the
extra care and expense devoted to
making Luckies easy on the throat.”

HON. ROB'T K REYNOLDS
U. S‘ SENATOR FROM NORTH CAROLINA

In a recent independent survey, an over—
whelming majority of lawyers, doctors, lecturers,
scientists, etc., who said they smoked cigarettes, ex-
pressed theit personal preference for a light smoke.

Senator Reynolds’ statement veriﬁes the Wis-
dom of this preference and so do leading artists of
radio, stage, screen and opera, Whose voices are
their fortunes, and who choose Luckies, a light
smoke. You, too, can have the throat protection
of Luckies—a light smoke, free of certain harsh

irritants removed by the exclusive process "It’s
Toasted”. Luckies are gentle on your throat.
