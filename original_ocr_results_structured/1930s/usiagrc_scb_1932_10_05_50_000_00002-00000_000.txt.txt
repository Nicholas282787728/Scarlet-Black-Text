MEET HIM HALF WAY

Students who have hitllcrto neglected to rev , -
for their automobiles, or otherwise comply with
campus rules concerning curs, because they thought
the regulations would not be enforced, have all-
other thin]: coming this year.

Deon Beatty. has become disgusted, and rights
ly so, with the whole situation. For the three years
he has been here. he has been very lenient about
student cars. Prior to his coming here, curs were
almost u lloi'ralty on the Calllp1157llltll'. is during the
day.

But Mr. Beatty. wishing to “play ball” with
the students, and seeing their sidc of tho question,
mode or ”IllgelllC‘llIS so that it was possible for up
per la mcn students to have cars at Sl'llOOl, if

‘ pcrm.siou were obtained from their parents and
the vehicles registered lit the t surcr’s offit .

Less than ll dozen automobiles were registered
last year. although it was easy lo see that there
were many more he 'e. The students. rather than
nicet tllc dcuu half \ ly, ignored or forgot about
the regulations. '

If those students are nugcrml h ' the stl‘icl (,“V
forcelllcllt of the rules this yClI , hey will have only

themselves to blame.

Rules, whether good or bad. are made to be
obeyed. Students should comply with lllemillllill
they have nmllngcd to have them Tt‘pt‘llled. by low
ically showing the powers that be that they are
unjust.

#G,
LET’S FIGHT
“I’m not going- to vote this year!” is a state-

merit which has been heard from two or three of

our sorcallcd “new voters." Tllc reasons for slit-h
an attitude seem to be threefold: Fi st pcrpl l y
concerning the platforll of the Repuhl 1, Demo-
erotic, and Socialist pill s; second, it feeling of ill-
difference or even Contempt t‘m' our “rotten politic-
al mochillcr ;” and third, a lack of knowledge as
to the fundamental processeh of voting.

In the first plz‘lcc, there aren’t very many of
us who can szly with tiny 0‘ it. deal of surety that
we know We al't- abollltely ght in voting our Wily;

BACK AGAIN

Students who missed the Chicago Tribune when
it was taken from the list of newspapers Subscribed
to by the library, will be gratified to know that it
will soon be back again.

A letter from He Schel M. Colbert, of the dos
pal'lluont of journalism, has informed us that Ills
though library funds are not sufficient to permit
subscribingY to any udditinuol newspapers. the Tri—
huuc will be furnished from funds of tho depart-
ment of journalism. A

The Chicago Tribullc was not included ill pulp
licntions subscribed to last year, bemuse it was
thought that its news and editorial polll‘les were
not of the suit with which the academic lnilld should
have contact.

The Scarlet and Black has since as 'cd for rc-
consideration of this action, belie 'Ilg that students
should be allowed to View both sides of questions,
whether they pertain to prohibition or militm sill.
as it is only fair that ll liberal arts college should
offer them full net 53 lo VfllIOllS illlcl'pl'etatiolls of

Cul'l‘olll: economic difficulties have strut-k deep
into the financial resources of every American
college. and as a (‘OllSPflllCllce there has been a
tremendous reduction of expense all around.

Dear Sir:

May I correct through your coir
umns any misunderstanding that in-
terested persons might have as a re-
sult of the recent editorial concerning

’ the absence of the Chicago Tribune

from the library?
College library funds are insuffic-
ient to permit subscribing for as many
newspapers as might be desired or
are needed for the use of Journalism
students in making the comparative
study of newspapers that is required
of them. The Department of Journalr
ism. therefore. uses a portion of its
departmental fund for that purpose,
and last spring the library committeel
was advised that this department
would subscribe to the Chicago
Tribune and perhaps two other papers
for general library use, The ordering
of these papers was delayed at the
beginning of the school year until ll.
could be determined how many
papers the library could take and how
much of the journalism funds could
be spared.
The library fund, it has now been
determined, can bear no additional‘
expense for newspapers, and so the
following arrangements have been
made: The Chicago Tribune and St.
Louis Post-Dispatch will be furnished
by the Department of Journalism, and
the Baltimore Sun will be furnished
jointly by the departments of history
and journalism, The subscriptions for
these papers are now being sent in
and they should be available within
a short time.
Very truly yours ,
Herschel M. Colbert

Dear Sir:

Tho Griunell Herald has long been
lrnown for its liberal views and court-
esy and we hope that it will continue
to carry out Such policies.

Last week in printing the ballots
for a straw vote of the town of Gun-
nell, The Herald ommited the name
of the Socialist candidate for govorr
nor from the ballot. We wonder if
courtesy and fairness alone would not
demand that it be included? Not to
mention the fact that the candidate

 

happens to be from our own town. The

results of this straw vote Will lln<
