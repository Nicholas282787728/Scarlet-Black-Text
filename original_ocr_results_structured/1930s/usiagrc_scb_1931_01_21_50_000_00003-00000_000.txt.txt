THE CHEERLEADER

And makes more din than cats on

The cheerleader is a goofy guy,
His actions are bad, his ways not
shy:
Things like him on a rope should be
slung,
Tied hy the neck until they are hung.

We are wondering it Helen Mc-
Leran has found Mr. Revere yet?
Report has it that she gave up the
search when, after looking all over
Cottage Three for him in response
to an urgent telephonic request,
and ﬁnding no one by that name on
any of the floors, she was told to
look outside and see if his horse
was there!

x-iuglr Edwards has a great lore for
nurses? Sunday night while viewing
“\Vhonpee” nt one of our numy
theaters, there came before his eyes
u scene wherein several benutiful
maidens, closely resembling that
great lady of history, Indy Godiva,
were riding on horseback “0h," ex-
claimed our here, “see the beautiful
horses!"

Doric's much worn copy of
“Black Beauty" may he had for

We pass this mystery on to you.
See if you can solve rt: A young las-
sie ran home to her mother and told
her that she had just seen two men,
not collegians of course, and that she
knew that they were murderers.
When asked why, she answered,
“I heard one of them tell the other,
‘Well, we might as well kill the other
one'.”

Drake Will Attempt

the Pioneer gym, losing again, this
time by one point, 16 to 15.

Friday’s battle should have an im»
pontant bearing on the ﬁnal outcome
of the 1930-31 valley race. Grinnell
has won one game and lost two, while
Drake has been victor and loser-
once. Both fives recently took de-
cisions over Washington on success-
ive nights. Drake won in an overtime
game, 24 to 13, while Grinnell took
a 28‘24 battle,

Creighton Tnhcs Drake, Grimicll

Comparative scores. however, are
as useless as a newly-weds cook
stove when comparing Drake and
Grinnell teams. The Bulldogs have
lost four games to date, starting the
season with a 13-3 loss to St. Louis
university, Grinnell took the Billi-
kens, 21 to 19.

Drake lost one-point games to Iowa
state and Iowa by 17-16 and 21-20
margins, respectively. Creighton over»
came a six-point Drake lead in the
second half to down the Bulldogs, 23
to 13, Friday night here. Grinncll
succrrrnhed to a last half rally of the
Bluejays on the Pioneer court Sat-
urday, 30 to 26,

Ceiling- May uiudcr King

John Monahan, guard, and Lynn
King, forward, are the Drake co-
captains. Between them they have
monopolized the spotlight for the
Bulldogs in each of the ﬁve contests.
Monnhan, a former teammate of
“Dick" Ullrich‘s at Roosevelt high
school of Des Moines, is rated among
the best guards in the conference. He
is second to King among the Drake
scorers, having 18 points to his credit.

King, the great little Lilla-round
Bulldog athlete, has counted 33 of his
teams 86 points. His high, arching
shots from far out on the court never

 

fail to thrill the cmwds, How he will
fare in the low-ceilingcd Grinnell gym
is problematieal, however.

Tu-o m. Mndisou Smtrs

Keith Pound, sophomore from Ft.
Madison, bus the cdge for the for
ward position opposite King. Poul-id,
although inexperienced, promises to
develop into a star. Frank Brody,
weleown tennis player, and Carroll
Esslck of Ankeny are other leading
candidates for a forward post,

Chet Buzard of st. Joseph, M0,,
another sophomore, is coach Buclter‘s
choice for Monahan's rrrnning mate
at guard. Buzard is well-versed‘in
basketball lore, and fits in well with
the quick—breaking Drake style of
piay. Chris Iverson, football halfback
from Council Bluffs, has seen action
at guard in every game so far during
the season.

Everett (Germany) Schultz, 6 foot
3 inch center from Milaca, Mind, is
the center. Although a triﬂe awk—
ward, Schultz is valuablc for follow-
up shots and in controlling the tip-
off. Milton Kokjohn of Ft. Madison,
1957p0und football tackle, is another
expert pivot man. He handles the ball
well and has a good basket eye, out
excessive weight is a handicap,

The vacation Monday did not in-
clude the reserves, Who tackled the
freshman live under the tutelage of
Coach L. L. Watt and outscored the
yearlings mercilessly. Yesterday’s
workout saw the varsity regulars and
ireserves in scrimmage, first against
each other and later against the
frosh.

Dick Uilrich. sophomore forward,
|who suffered from a pulled muscle in
the Creighton Contest here Saturday
night, has been taking his regular
turn on the floor this Week and will
be in shape to [angle with Drake here
Friday. Frank Duncan, chief Grin-
nell scoring threat, whose basket eye

failed him against the Bluejays, has
been flicking the netting again this
week.

Duncan was in third place in MisA
souri Valley conference scoring at
the completion of loop contests last
week. Maurice Van Ackeren, Creigh-
ton. is leading the procession, second-
ed by Ted saussele, scarlet-thatched

Washington university forward.

Humphrey continues with a slight
edge on Edman at the center berth,
while McCreary and Douglas are
handling the guard positions capahly.
Offensive plays centering about these
veteran guards are being stress-
ed by Coach Truesdale this week.
