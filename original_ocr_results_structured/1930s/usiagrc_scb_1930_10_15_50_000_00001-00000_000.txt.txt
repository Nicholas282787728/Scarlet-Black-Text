Cuadra Finds
Adventure in

Life of East

Fi lpino of Pirate Descent
Fought Starvation,
Kidnapping

By FRANK BEATLE

He has livedithis Matias Cuadra.
A descendant of the Mohammedan
Moro tribe, Malayan pirates living in
the northern Philippines: kidnapped as
a boy by a German Jesuit priest and
left to starve in Borneo; Christian
converter of hundreds of Mohamme—
dans, including his own father and
mother; his has been 'a life of self
sacrifice and achievement.

The dark-eyed Filipino was a
guest speaker at Grinnell yesterday.
and continued today in his addresses
before various classes. Arriving too
late for his scheduled chapel talk
yesterday morning, he spoke before
classes in history and applied
Christianity during the day. and ad-
dressed a general assembly in the
chapel at 7:30 p. rn.

Brought Here by ‘Y’s

Mr. Cuadra was brought here by
the local Young Men's Christian as
sociation 'and Young Women's Chris—
tian association in cooperation with
the Student Volunteer Movement of
America, and is making a lecture
tour of the United states. His Iowa
itinerary includes Coe, University of
Iowa, Dubuoue. and Crinnell. He
will travel in the United States until
Dec. 25, at which time he expects to
be sent to England.

In an interview yesterday after-
noon he stated that he never at-
tempted to cite personal instances in
his addresses before general assem-
blies, ”The time is too limited, for
that," he explained. "I have been
asked why I do not tell of what I
have seen in the for East, but in an
hour or so I can only give a brief
sketch of the entire situation."

Organization strong Hero

Mr. Cuadra is intensely interested
in college Y. M. C. Ans. He remark»
ed that in some places the organiza-
tion was entirely dead. A president
was elected early in the year and
then everyone went to sleep, was his
way of expressing it, But in Iowa

and in Grinnell. especially, the Chris:

tian organization was strong. he be-
lieved.

“Self government in the Philippines
cannot be brought about until a more
stable government is established,"
declared the speaker last night in his
address on “America in the Far
East." The former Mohammedan
stated that he was confident that
America would do the right thing in
the matter, and’that the strong and
weak points in the arguments for and
against Filipino independence would
be weighed carefully:

Americans started Education

In the afternoon he told
of the good that has been
accomplished by the American
government in the islands. Compub
sory education and Christian religion
were the factors which be considered
the most important.

"The three religions prevalent in
my country have been the Catholic,
Mohammedan, and pagan," "The
former is not the good religion that it
is in America, but is of a corrupt na-
ture."

To illustrate this he told of a cer-
tain Catholic tribe that holds a cere-
rnony in which the members whip
themselves with heavy rawide thongs,
driving themselves up a. mountain-
side to the church and having slits
cut in their backs to exemplify the

Rosen Directs 12 Mermen
in Preseason Drills

Semiweeekly

Coach Elton A. Rosa: will have to
build his swimming team around
three letter men, but with 12 men
answering the preliminary call, he
should be able. to form a fairly strong
squad. Varsityoprac‘tices will be every

From all reports Grinnell seems to
have found a ﬁne coach in the form
of Mr. Rosen. During the few weeks
that he has had charge of cTosSA
country and swimming, he has prov~
ed that he is capable of handling men
and that he is thoroughly Cognizant
of these two Sports.

like promising material. Both are
free style swimmers and turned in
respectable times in their events last

Charles Wlmdy. free Style: Fred
Lichty, breast Stroke; Burt Holmes,

news, their writing ability, and their
previous experience. Tryouts for The

Miss cle Dedinszky Finds Music
of America Best, Worst in World

"America, I think has the best
musicians in the world, and the
worst." That is the manner in which
Miss Izabelle de Dedinszky of the
academy of music at Budapest, who
is studying in Grinnell this year,
classified American artists,

”One finds the greatest musicians
of Europe in Boston, Philadelphia,
and New York»perbhps Chicago, I
do not know; they come here because
you have the money to pay for con-
certs. You have great artists, but
you also have jazz; that is the
worst."

Hungary Has Jazz

"But doesn't Hungary have any
jazz," thc Crinnell students wanted to
know.

“Oh, yes: but not so much. Two
years ago when your jazz was first
introduced into my country, they play
ed it at fill the balls; but that made
the gypsies, who llatl always played

for us before, out of work, so they
begged for the managers to use them
at least part of the time. Now, a
band plays your jazz for a while;
then we have gypsy music for a
dance or two, and again your jazz."

Grinncll campus large

Miss Dedinszky likes Grinnell and
its Students. “Your campus is so
large. In Europe they are not so
huge. We do not have so much land.
I like it and I like the girls, They
are so friendly and ask me so many
qucstiohs and tell me so many
things. They Seem to know just how
I am ’fresh'."

She said that American students as
a whole are a. little lighter hearted,
and do not tolre things so seriously
215 the Europeans. “But it is better
to be that way; you get so much
more happiness. I wish I could be
like that."

Paper Enrolls
in Association

Scarlet and Black Elected
to National Scholastic

Press Group

Black becomes a member of the Na-
tional Scholastic Press association.
This is the first time that the paper
has been enrolled in a national scho-
lastic organization. It is now a meme

iation and the Newspapeg Enterprise

ests of all forms of collegiate and
scholastic journalism.

The association, formerly the Cen-
tral Interscholastic Press associa-
tion, founded in 1921 with headquar~
ters at Madison, Wis., outgrew the
original form of organization when
it expanded to include members from
every state. The association was re-
organized two years ago in order to
serve more efﬁciently the enlarged
demands made upon it ,and the name
was changed from central to natiolr
al.

The membership is divided into
four groups. These include the col-
lege and university. junior college and
normal school, high school, and jun-
ior high school divisions. The three
types of publications holding meme
berships are newspapers, yearbooks,
and magazines. Membership'is by

Dibble hall easily succeeded in run-
ning up a 16 to a score on the Build-
ing Three team Monday afternoon in
the second appearance of the Dibble

in the opponents' territory most of
the time. Farrara was the high scor—
er for Dibble, running up five points
in the second quarter.

Wolfrnger started the scoring with
a goal in the early part of the game.
Duncan added two and Parzybok
three points in the third quarter, and
Straley completed the total with two
points in the last quarter.

Allison got the Building Three
scores with a free kick during the
third quarter, and two more in the
fourth period.

Coaches—Lester “In“: for Grin-

By LEIGHTON HOUSE
(Special to The Scarlet and Black)

DES MDINEsiThere’s an old ad-
age about “locking the door after
the horse has been stolen." But if
the owner has more than one horse
he may be able to save his remain-
ing animals from being pilfered.

Coach Ossie Solem and the Dmke
football team. fortunately enough,
have seven horses left. But the dark
equine which must be roped and tied
is G'rinnelliand that on Friday
night at the Drake stadium.

Bulldogs Outplayerl Marquette

Gridiron fans will remember how
Drake was beaten 12 to 0 by Mar-
quette last Friday as a result of two
intercepted passes, that were con-
verted into touchdowns by runs of 95
and 45 yards. Although the Bull-
dogs continually outplayed the Gold-
en Avalanche to the tune of 20 first
downs to 7, football games are de-
cided by the score.

Thus the grizzled Drake mentor
spent most of Monday and Tuesday
teaching his proteges to “check” his
passing ‘attack. This means having
players in a position to tackle the
runner in case a pass is intercepted,
But for two lapses of this kind in the
Marquette game, the score might
have been entirely different.

Halfbacks on Sidelines

The Bulldog squad, as a whole,
came out of the Milwaukee game in
good shape. "Chuck" Van Koten and
Chris Iverson, Drake's pair of hard-
driving halfbacks, played their
hearts out against the Hilltoppers
and were forced to remain on the
sidelines during both Monday’s and
Tuesday: drill. Both are battered
and bruised, but should be in good
shape for the Pioneers.

Determination fairly radiated from
the Drake camp during the practice
sessions. Every man is bound that
Grinnell shall be the first victim of
the Bulldog bite. Incidentally, a
Drake victory would set the Des
Moines team well on its way toward
a conference championship.

No Scrirmnoges

No scrimmage was dished out by
Coach Solem. He is relying on the
mental attitude of his boys to bring
