Pioneer Five Loses 34-33
After Gaining Lead
in Last Minute

An agonizmg last minute of play
which saw Grinnell's basketeers surge

to the front only to have a last sec-I

ond shot by Carr, Tutor forward, vi n
the game 34 to as for the visitors
featured the first Pioneer cage game
of the season with Iowa state Teach-
crs college hcre Saturday evening.

Altho the Grinnell flve's passing
was ragged, and members of the
team displayed a tendency toward
traveling and unnecessary roughness,
its work on the whole was above
average for the first game of the
season

Bauer, nuMont, aliphant

Coach John c. Truesdale's all-
veteran five was bmken up early in
the first half by the insertion of
Julius Bauer, sophomore center, and
Harry DuMont, junior guard, who
added the necessary drive to the
team. Harve Oliphant, sophomore for-
ward candidate, played an excellent
game when substituted several times
for Mason and Frye, at forward
posts.

Grinnell led at the hair by a 1642
,margtn, holding the Tutors to two
'field goals, and caging seven goals,
most of which were set-ups. Mainly
through the activities of Lambert,
guard, however, the visitors gradual-
ly passed the Pioneers in scoring du -
ing the second period, and with five
minutes to play, led 27 to 23. .

making the score 31 to 27, with one
minute to go.

The Pioneers, led by Dick Mason,
foiward, came back with a furious
rally. The fast-breaking Ma-son
dropped one in from the center of
the floor, followed up with two free
throws, and then caged another long
one to presumably put the game on

{ice for the Pioneers with a 33-31
score.
Lambert, Carr win

Lambert, tricky Tutor guard, was
fouled, however, with but a few sec~
ends to go. He sank one charity toss,
and the second bounded off the bank-
board to he snatched by his team-
mate, Carr, who swished it into the
netting for the winning two points.
The timer's gun ended the game be-
fore the ball could he brought to the
center of the floor for the tip-off.

statistics show that the Pioneers
caged 28 per cent of their field goal
attempts, sinking 12 out of 43 tried.
Fifty per cent of their short shots
were successful and 37 per cent of
long shots attempted went in the
hoop, but none of the 14 “medium”
attemptsibetween lo and 20 feet
from the basket—were good.

Make Good Percentages

Mickey Frye, with two shorts and
a long, and Harry DnMont, sinking
two long shots and a tip-in, each
had a .500 average, considering the
six attempts which each made at the
basket Les Manns, guard, caged one
out of two attempts; Dick Phelps,
center, one out of three, and Dick
Mason, four out of 17.

The Grinnell team missed seven
