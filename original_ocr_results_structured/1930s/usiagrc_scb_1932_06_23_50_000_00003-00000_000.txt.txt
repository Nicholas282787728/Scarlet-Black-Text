in the winning the Olympic event
over a field of the world's greatest
hurdlers. In London and in Dublin, he
was on winning relay teams, and at
the latter games, he won the 4007
meter hurdles and the AODrmeter run.
Upon his return to the United States,
he established a new U S-record in

Taylor was never an outstanding
star, but could always be depended
upon for points in the broad jump,
both hurdle races. the 140. and on re-
