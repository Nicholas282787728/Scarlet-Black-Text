Higher Edutafi'on Takes to the Air

Colleges to T ain Reserve Pilots

Annual flying meets are staged by the National Intercollegiate Flying Club organized in 1935.
The national organization is made up of the 20 flying clubs (the first was orqanixed at Harvard more
than 10 years ago) which have a total membership of more than 400 members who last year spent
more than 10,000 hours in the air. The flying meets test competitors in bomb dropping, maneuver-
ing and cross country flying, and lay particular stress on safety (no member of any llyinq club has
had a crack-up or been killed). Fifty per cent ol the llyiny club members obtain piloL's licenses at
the close ol their training period. Caiiegrsrenracswnara berltam

With the armaments race among the nations of the world proceeding
at an ever quickening pace, U. 5. colleges and universities this month
joined in the movement to create a great reserve corps cl trained air
pilots and aeronautic technicians.

Aided by a special grant of $100,000 lrom the National Youth
Administration, the program announced by President Roosevelt pro-
vides for a trial training period at a group of selected institutions, in-
cluding Purdue, Alabama, Minnesota, Washington, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Texas A at M, Georgia Tech and Kansas.
Each ol the 300 students enrolled under the trial program will receive
50 hours of dual and solo instruction, qualifying them for a private
pilot's license. Enrollment is limited to those between the ages on!)
and 25, and is open to women as the program is co—educational.

If this program is successlul, luture plans call for the training of
20,000 students in the next five years. The President‘s budget message
asked for an annual appropriation of $9,800,000 to carry out the pro-

. gram.

Already active in aeronautical training work, many colleges and
universities have flying clubs and aeronautics courses. Collegiate
Digest hero presenis’a picture-story of higher education in the air.

In addition to the worl< of the flying clubs, collegiate air activities are
fostered also by Alpha Eta Rho, professional aviation fraternity
lounded at the University of Southern California in 1929. Other
chapters are at U. C. L. A. and Northwestern, and additional groups
will soon be installed at San Diego State, San Jose State and Santa
Barbara State. The group above is planning details of an air meet.

Purdue aeronautical students learn all also... wing Many learn about planes by constructing models These Alabama Polytechnic Institute students are re-
construction by constructing one. as these Santa Barbara State students are doing, conditioning a motor and its ship.

Santa Barbara students construct a plane radio. Finished unit at right.

Purdue's 224-acre airport is one ol largest owned by a college.
