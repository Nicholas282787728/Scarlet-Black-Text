:OPEN LETTER TO DR. WALTER
KOTSCHNIG -

.We are glad to be able to welcome you
back to the Grinnell campus. We say back
advisedly, for although you were here for
only a short time two years ago, you were
here, and hence are returning.

Those of us who have known you are
eager to hear and meet you again. Those
who have not had that pleasure will find
our opinion of you more than justified.

It is our pleasure and privilege to have
you with us for the next month. May we
hope that during that time you may grow
to like Grinnell and that we may take the
fullest advantage of your discussions of
pertinent issues.

STALEMATE

Many weeks ago the Student Council
sent a delegation to the Culriculum com-
mittee presenting a plan for an alleviation
of the evils extant under the present cut
system

The delegation met with a very co-
operative attitude and it appeared that a
new system would be worked out under
which sufficient limitation would be im-
posed upon thosc who need it, while stu—
dents in good standing would be allowed to
treat classroom attendance as one ‘of the
aspects of scholarship.

It was hoped that students making
satisfactory scholastic records would be re-
moved Tl'om the arbitrary limitation of cuts
under which students have comcierroneouS‘
ly enough, but univel'sally——to feel that they
have a faculty-given right to cuts up to the
limit, but not exceeding it. Steering close
to the wind, and discounting the fallibility
of professor's absence reports has come to
be a common student custom, at which, un-
fortunately, thcy are not too adept.

The result, then, of each semester’s
operation under the present system is that
many students lose hours of college credit
which they have fully earned and received
satisfactory grades for, simply because they
exceed the cut limitation.

The objection, then, which demands an
answer is the elimination of the double
penalty now imposed. How long must stu-
dents continue to be penalized not only for
the loss in instruction (‘2) occurring when
cuts are taken, but also for committing the
sin of taking too many cuts. It is our con-
tention that so long as credit hours are
earned they should be received.

There has been as yet no action
announced on the solution of this problem

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

for the second semester. Are we to remain
in the same well-worn rut, and continue to
suffer the double penalty?

AN OBJECT LES—S N

On Friday, Gl‘innell college students
will have the opportunity of hearing a pro—
gram of piano and organ music presented
by members of our own faculty, Prof.
Elias Blum, organist, and Elsie Haggard
Ryan, pianist.

Like most people, Grinnell college stu-
dents are prone to the belief that distant
fields are greener and that unknowns are of
necessity more able than local talent.

Careful consideration and attendance at
the concert Friday will be a great object
lesson in the falsity of this belief.

MORE ON “PINK TEAS"

When, in the middle of December, at a
meeting called to explain Grinnell‘s athletic
policy to the athletes, Prof. Earl D. Strong
flayed in humorous fashion various social
activities on the campus, mentioning in
particular “pink teas" and “shady nooks"
as demoralizing influences.

With his generalities, we heartily agree.

But in special cases, we claim exception
to the general rule.

We are of the opinion that the social
activities of yesterday played a helpful
part in putting, not only the team, but the
students in a winning frame of mind. To
be sure, that does not justify social activity
as a training measure for athletes, but we
think it has its place.

There’s an old saying that all work and
no play makes Jack a dull boy, which, while
trite, is still true.

So, ’til someone suggests something
better, we are willing to play along in the
social whirl and enjoy the ”shady nooks,”
dancing and “pink teas" along with our
athletic teams.

Do you ever find yourself rather annoy-
ed at some of the odd beliefs of your college
compatriots? Some, as a well known star
stated in “Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" a year
or so ago, are doodlei's ; that is they find in
terest in drawing those strangely reticulated
squares, circles and triangles on odd places
in their notebooks. Others are pencil tap-
pers, others are foot toppers or even shoe
squeakers, In fact, a multitude of these
little hapibts reveal themselves in every
group of people.

Queer and amusing are some that
famous persons have had, Heine, the Ger»
man writer, had to place his feet on a cake
of ice and inhale the ordor of rotten apples
before he could work. An Italian Count of
the Seventeenth Century, whose name has
been long forgotten, but whose emotional
romances are provocative of laughter, had
to be chained to his chair by his servants
in order that he might work.

“Colletee,” the woman writer, resident
of France and now a member of the French
Academy, couldn't write unless she wore
her sabots or peculiar type of shoe. Bad
table manners do not make great men nor
do indulgence of these little eccentricities in
personality help the college student.

Psychology labels such peculiar personal
habits as “Tics” and says they show mal-
adjustment in personality somewhere along
the line. if your ”tic” is unwittingly offen-
sive, examine your own personality to see
what it is. Get lid of it, if you can, for in
this day and age when personality counts
for so much, it is wise to disintagle one’s
self from such encumbrances.

“Powers of concentration are greater in a
girls‘ school. The girls lose nothing by not
rubbing shoulders with men. They work
when they work and play when they play,"
Mi's. Vivienne l3. Breckenridge, alumnae
secretary of Sweet Brial‘ college, says that
private schools for girls prepare them better
for matrimony than do coeducational insti-
tutions.

DORIC

After diligent searching and
probing, Doric has unearthed the
real reason for the “noble cxpeli»
ment” of the Women's League
Board last Thlusclay nlgllt when
they entertained the dean of
women and the cottage hostesses
at “dinner” at the local tavern.
While members of thc party insist
that the guardians of the coeds-
morals on this campus made this
trip only [or the “dinner," it is
told us on reliable lutoxmcucn
that Miss Gardner did enjoy the
foray into the pub greatly, ’I’d
always wanted to go," she said,
"but Dcun Beatty never would
take me." It would seem not
amlSS for some one to initiate the
dean mm the spirit of the thing
now that the ice has been chipped,
