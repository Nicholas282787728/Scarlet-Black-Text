Cornell Loses
Eight Letterman
Including Cole

Mt. Vernon, Iai’l‘he cornell
grid squad of approximately 30
men furnish the nucleus for
Coach Dick Barkers Purple
team that went through last sea-
son undefeated and untied.

The loss of eight lcttermen in
key positions promises to keep
the entire squad stepping in pre-
pa‘ration for a difficult nine game
schedule which includes a,final
tussle with the powerful \Louisiana
Tech. eleven.

”Our chances are only fair com-
pared with the outlook that we
had previous to the unbeaten sea-
son of last year.” Barker states.

Ends and tackles have been get—
ting the greater share of atten»
tion in the preseason drills, since
the Hilltoppers lost five letter»
men in these positions through
graduation.

The toughest spot to fill will be
the right flank vacated by last
year’s captain, Franklin Cole, one
of the best ends ever produced on
the Hilltop.

‘ waa'1914 Grid
Captain, Past
Pioneer Coach

father of Orpha Sherman and cap-
tain of Grinnell’s 1914 football
team, died yesterday at Iowa
Methodist hospital in Des Monies.

Holding letters in three sports,
football. basketball and track, he
had an uncanny mind for telling
where a play was going in root-
ball and was an excellent open
field runner.

A graduate of Grinneil in 1914,
Sherman went to his first coach-
ing post at Ripon college, Ripon,
Wis. He returned to Des Moincs
in 1918 and a year later came to
Grinnell to serve as head basket-
ball coach and assistant football
coach, He remained in that capa-
city for one year. .

Funeral sewices will be at 2
pm. tomorrow in Des Moiiics.
