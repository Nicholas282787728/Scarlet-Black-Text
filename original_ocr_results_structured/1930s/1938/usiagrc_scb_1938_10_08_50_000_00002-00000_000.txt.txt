REPEAT PERFORMANCE

It is with great pleasure that a Grinnellian
can go into the White House just south of
the dean of men’s office any day or night
except Sunday and see his fellow students
enjoying themselves there.

To the freshmen, the White House, not
yet a year old, will seem like an institution;
and as for upperclassmen, they wonder how
we ever got along without one. The White
House has satisfied a need long felt on the
campus and has become an indispensible
part of Grinnell life. Grinnell students
should respect it for what it is, go and en-
joy themselves there and make it a real
student union at Grinnell-

Although the idea of a student union
on the Grinnell campus has been in the
minds of some people for a good many
years, the White House project itself was
a direct result of last year’s Brooklyn con-
ference. The conference last year was the
first of its kind to be held at Grinnell, and
the results of this meeting more than justi—
fied the trouble and expense incurred in
arranging it.

Next weekend the second annual Stu—
dent Leader's conference will be held at
Brooklyn. After last year’s splendid re-
sults, we are looking forward very much to
the efforts and results of this year’s meet
ing.

ZEPHYR NEEDS SUPPORT

There was a time when Gl'innell was known
as, among other things, the place Where the
Malteaser was published-

There was a time when the Maltcaser,
backed by Sigma Delta Chi, men’s national
honorary and professional journalistic fra-
ternity, was referred to as ”the judge of
mid—western wit" and the best in the west.

There was a time when this magazine
was awaited eagerly by other college humor
publications, and we do not think it is going
too far to say that it was accepted sonic-
what as a standai . If any Grinnell stil-
dents care to see just what kind of a inagas
zine was published, they have only to go

back to the files and look over some of the
publications.

But that is all water over the dam, andl
the Malteaser, as a successful humor maga-
zine, is now a symbol of the post. i

This newspaper approves of, and will
support, a good humor magazine on this
campus. We believe in the Zephyr as a
great possibility and have great confidence
in the work now being done by the editor
and the business manager of the Zephyr to
make a successful publication of the maga-
line

But we must admit that, to be success—
ful, efficient, and to work to the best in-
terest of all, a project of such proportions
as a campus humor magazine must have
interested and efficient backing by a respons‘
sible organization.

There is delinitcly a place for a humor
magazine at Grinnell today—a magazine
which can provide clever and original humor,
without becoming just another gag sheet.

Grinnell needs a clever humor maga-
zine, and, we believe, with the present
Zephyr staff, Grinnell will have one; but
such a publication cannot be clever, nor even
successful, without an organization of re-
sponsible backing.

We believe in the Zephyr, because we
know it has great possibilities; and we trust
in its staff to bring about these possibilities.
We only urge the Zephyr to lay a founda-
tion for a permanant humor publication with
a responsible campus organization backing
it, so that, this time, Grinnell will be known
as once again “the place where the Zephyr
is published.”

¥G—
THE CRISIS AND AMERICA

Japan’s invasion of China, the Italian con-
quest of Ethiopia, and Germany‘s tactics in
Europe have found American public opinion
arrayed against the so—called Fascist powers.
Recently, the speech of Prime Minister
Chamberlain was heard in America with
deep approval. And there is no doubt that,
since the ill»fated German naval conference
of 1927, America and Britain have been
collaborating on closer and closer terms.
These and other indications would seem to
point to American involvement in world
affairs,

However, on the other side, tending to»
ward insolation, are the Johnson act, the
neutrality act, and the well known peaceful
inclinations of the American people-

But will we keep at home ill a general
European or world war? The best informed
historians and social scientists can not give
us a sure answer. The forces of idealism,
selfishness, common sense, patriotic emo-
tions and the volotility of public opinion
will all be mixed in varying proportions.

On Aug. 19, 1914 Woodrow Wilson
addressed the American people and said,
“Everyman who really loves America will
act and speak . . . in the spirit of im~
partiality and fairness and friendliness to
all concerned . - It will be easy to excite
passion and diii'icult to allay it . . . The
people of the United States . . . may be
divided in camps of hostile opinion, involved
in the war itself in impulse and opinion, if
not in action - . .

“ . i . We must be impartial ill thought
as well as in action, must put it curb upon
our sentiments.”

Have not the people of the United
States already involved themselves in these
various cl" es “in ilnpulse and opinion, if
not in action,” as we did prior to our ell—
trancc into the last world war? It is a
short stop from thought, impulse, and
opillion to actual action and participation.
