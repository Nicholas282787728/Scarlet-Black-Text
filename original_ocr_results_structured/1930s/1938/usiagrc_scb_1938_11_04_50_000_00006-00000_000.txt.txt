ON. GRINNELL!

Once more it is "back to old Grinnell, to
the college you love so well.” It is with a
mingling of many emotions that we extend
to each returning alumnus it most hearty
Grinnell welcome. But, also, to the thou-
sands of Grinnell’s sons and daughters who
could not return for homecoming, we extend
a greeting that banishes the yeztrs, and,
through the medium of the Grinnell Spirit,
makes you one of us again.

This week elld’s gala celebration will wit-
mess the return of many Grinnell gradue
ates, but there will be scarcely one among
you in all this sincere revelry that will not
stop for an instant to recall the days that
used to be, In many quarters there will be
the famous ‘bull session’ or 'hen heckel,’ as
the case may be, full of reminiscence and
reverie, and this is as it should be, for on
this and this only the Grinnel] Spirit has
its foundation and only upon such a firln
foundation can we hope to build a worthy
superstructure

To a great many of ollr graduates it
must seem a bit disconcerting at first to
come from a world of change to an insti-
tution that is also changing. It is only hu-
man and natural for some of you to hope,
that after the kaleidoscope of every day life
it would seem good to get back to the some
place where four of the happiest years of
your lives were spent and to look forward
to seeing the “dear old place again." But it
is not so, and it must not he so. In the
structure of our buildings, in the beauty of
the campus, and in the reputation that
Grinnell holds in the educational world, we
can find strength and solidarity. But, if
Grinnell is to maintain its place, the ele-
ment of change must always exist and pr —
dominate even as the college’s personally
changes with each generation. We must not
allow ourselves to be satisfied with things
as they are; things that manage to work
but not any too well, at that

Dr. Edward A. Steiner, whom we all
know and love, has said in his biggest little
book, The GTilt’ltGll Spirit, in a reply to the
question of what is this spirit:

” r r . It's ml inheritance, and partly

conscious development. What we have

we guard zealousll , but we build upon
it, and accept the daily contribution
which comes from the m'uwulg student
body, from mt ulc'l't faculty, It most
loyal Alumul‘, and from our culcl'ged
erupcl'l'cucc. Noue of us believes that

Gr-iuuell is perfect or (b perfected col-

lege, It is a, growing institutiou with

high ideals which it trics to realize.

It has a meat program null, therefore,

great needs . . . . ”

There is more bllt we all should get the

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

book and read it for ourselves. In a large
measure. the success of it greater Grinuell
is dependent upon how well those who ai'c
really loyal to the college catch and retain
the spirit of that book, The Gl'iuucll S7)’ .

ALUMNI, we welcome you! We welcome
you in a spirit of 1" icndship that only Grins
nellions can know. We hope this weekend
will prove most pleasant to you in rencwmg
old fr ntlships, old acquaintances and old
memo es. We beg of you one thing: do
not forget that Grillllcll is “a growmg ln-
stitutioll with high ideals ullich it tricsvto
realize,” With your help, may we realize
these ideals and build toward a greater
Grillnell.

WHAT'S THE MATTER .
WITH THE MEN?

From the looks of the way men participate
ill outside ac vities here, the great major-
ity of our org-our ltions will be made up
entirely of women in the future.

At present the Pioneer chorus, under the
direction of F, Walter Huffman, is in
danger of disbanding because of the lack
of male voices In a past issue of this news
paper, we editorialized to the effect that
men are needed in the Pioneer chorus, and
we encouraged such enrollment. No r0-
spouse has been noticed. What is the mat-
ter‘r7 Gl'luncll is u college noted for its music
school, and we are proud of our musical
organizations here. Are intrulnurul sports
the only activity that men consider worth
while here '2

Men are badly needed in the college build,
men are needed on publication staffs, men
are badly needed in numerous other activi-
lies.

Only this week it was learned that a
faculty member advised a man to drop an
activity so that he could “get an I ” in a
particular course. Experience has shown
that grades mean little in this world, dull
the Scarlet and Black hotly disapproves of
such blocking of participation in outside
activities by certain individuals who be-
lieve that an H is the only thing to bring
success.

You’re not a ”sucker” when you particl-
pzlte ill outside activities. You’re only help-
ing to make Grinncll great. It’s not a
“waste of time," for valuable experience is
gained—sometimes to a greater advantage
ill the long rim than ' long list of H‘s and
S's. When you ask for a job, you’re not
asked how many honor grades you have.
made; you’re asked “what experience have
you had?”

The Pioneer chorus is definitely benefi-
cial to you and to the college.

Thr- dormitories zlre full of men who doI
nothing here but engage in useless activities
in their spare time. It is true, we come to
college for an education; but “education”
does not apply only to books It applies to
regular engagement in beneficial activties,
which may, ill years to come, be of great
advantage in some future work.

We dislike the idea of seeing the chorus
die out, for it is a truly worth while organi-
zaton, providing for good experience and
entertainment, as well as all activity for
men who may not be adapted to participa—
tion in any other campus organization. We
have known of persons who enter into musl—
cal organizations for relaxation; and, truly,
nothing can be more relaxing than listen—
ing to, singing or playing good music.

Whether the Pioneer chorus is continued
remains with the men of Grinnelll

SUPPORT THE ANNUAL

For the first time in several years the
junior class of Grillnell college has had
cllough initiative and drive to put out an
annualr

An annual is a book to be treasured
What is clearer to a college graduate than
romembernnccs of his happy college life?

Not only is an annual of interest to the
students now in college or to those who
havobcen graduated, but also to those who
are Just entering or thinking of entering.

Therefore, for your sake, as well as for
the sake of those who will come to Grill-
ncll in future years, make this annual a
success.

LISTEN! THE WIND
By Aline Morrow Lindbergh
Harcourt, Bruce and Company
(in college library)
As Colonel Lindbergh explains in
his forcward to Anne Lindbergh‘s
hook, it is a “tale of a kind of
aviation soon to go,” and if hc is
right, it is too had, because Anne
gives one an appreciation of such
aviation which has perhaps been
lacking in the average reader.
The book is a delightfully pore
sonal yet very matter of fact ac—
count of a small part of the
Lindbergn's Atlantic Survey
flight. It tells of the several ate
tempts to locate an African base
from which to take off for the
point of Natal on the coast of
Brazil, and of the ﬂight itself.
The theme throughout is the
pilot's dependence on Wind, winrl,
just the right amount and direcs

 

tion of wind, the waiting for it.
and the rush to make use of it
when it comes. All through the
hook the spirits of the Linds
berghs, their helpers, and the
reader rise and fail with the cons
trariness of the tropic wind.

Anne Llndbergh's gift as an em
presslvc writer seems to be in her
ability to make the reader feel
intensively with her. Curlcd in
her cockpit attending to her radio
duties, at times anxious about
flying conditions, yet relying on
her knowlcrge that her husband
“doesn‘t take chances,” she ex-
presses most palgnzmtly the ro~
inance and the matter of fact tie»
tail of survey aviation.

Especially does one rise nith
her to the exaltation of success—
ful flying and respond to the
sickening anxiety and spiritual
drop of failure. Mrs. Lindbergh
has such a sensitiveness to the
relationship of her position to her
surroundings. When in air with
direct, smooth ﬂying and a tail
wind, sire feels as must a god
"sitting on top of the sky” who
may see “yesterdayiEumpe; to-
dayiAfrica: tomorrow—Ameri—
cs." Then, instead, the plane is a
“sliver of hark tossed this way
anrl that on the choppy sulfacc
of a great, unruly sea of air."
Here, too, the reader is compelled
to follow with a feeling of panic
and helplessnss.

The book is completely charm-
ing. The unity of the story is very
Wise, since the struggles and re-
peated trials of the take-off make
a fine foundation to the triumphs
ant flight. The hook, except for
the colonel's lists of equipment, is
not intended to be a technical dis~
cussion in any sense hut only a
tale of a real, every day, advens
turou life, and as such it has tre-
mendous appeal,
