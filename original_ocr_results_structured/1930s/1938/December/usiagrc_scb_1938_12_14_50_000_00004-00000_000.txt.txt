THE FRUITS OF PEACE

Unless some unforeseen event takes place
within the next few days, Christmas 1938
will see the world at peace. To be sure, this
peace is not based upon good will toward
men; it is on the contrary, a peace bought
with tremendous sacrifices of honor and
with enormous concessions from the weak
to the strong, a jungle peace which is last-
ing because the weak are afraid and bees
cause the strong are temporarily uppeased.
Next year we may be happy to remember.
the comparative peace of today. Next your
the strong may no longer be satisfied!

In the meantime here is Christmas, For
most of us it will be a time of family re-
unions, of rest, of good food, of parties, of
presents—the fruits of peace; most of us
will be comfortable and happy.

When the old pagans had enough, they
sacrificed to their gods; but today we need

' not burn on the altar the best parts of the
Chi" tmas turkeyt The sacrifice Will be
nothing material; all we must give up is
our indifference to our fellow-men.

Good will is not passive; it is a love of
man and a hatred of the instruments by

‘ which he is oppressed. We shall do as much
as we immediately can for the cause of
peace if we decide that Christmas is not
only a time for good feeling but a time for
indignation toward cruelty and intolerance
of injustice, These, too, are parts of peace.

NEW EMPHASIS 0N
VOCATIONAL FORUMS

For the past three years, Grinnell has been
conducting vocations forums for the sons
iol's, The underclassmcn could have justifi—
ably criticized those forums for seeming to
include no one but SCIIIOI‘Sl It is true that
all students could have attended, but they
scarcely felt encouraged to go. This year,
however, sophomores and juniors are urged
to be present.

This change of emphasis has resulted
from the l' alizatioll that underclassmen can
profit even more than seniors by these
meetings. The forums, of course, are weekly
gatherings, each of which is devoted to the
presentation of many aspects of some occu-
pational field. Prominent representatives of
several occupations will be featured as
speakers and counselors.

Interested students of all classes may at-
tend any of the meetings ill the series of
forums, and through the use of wider
knowledge gained at them, may make more
intelligent choices concerning their own fur
tures _

A student who is aiming at a certain oc-
cupation or at graduate study has definite
advantages ill choosing his college courses
and activities over a student who has no
specific interest. Furthermore, an under
classmnn has considerably more time than a
senior to cultivate the requirements for Suc-
cess ill his particular field. _ ~

Another feature of the new emphasis is
ill the job huntst Next spring some of the
juniors will be encouraged to take the trips
on which the seniors look for work._An
acquaintance with the methods of lntcrvlew-
ing prospective employers, and a knowledge
of the fields of employment needing _the
lnost new men, will certainly help the Juli-
iors to be more effective in securing work
when they are seeking it.

This new emphasis is certainly commends
able, but profitable only insofar as the
sophomores and juniors take advantage of
it. It is for their taking!

WHAT IS THIS MIG CALLED PEACE?

(Reprinted from the College Greetings)
What is this peace that is so much talked
about—this ephemeral something for which
nations are prepared to do battle? Is it a
quality? Is it a condition? Is it something
perceivablc to the sight or the touch? Who
knows? But we like to think of it as an attlv
tude of calmness, balance, and poise oil the
part of individual citizens which can create
first a national and then an international
restraint

Peace is not an innate quality of the hu-
man soul, Rather it is something which must
be attained by diligent, persistent effort.
And ill this world of utter chaos, the dltfl-
clllty lies ill retaining freedom from right-do
tion once it has been gained Those lnaglllfh
cent few who have achieved this ideal of
public tranquillity and harmony ill human
relationships stand out in history not only
as masters of their own fate, but as mold-
ers of the destiny of the world.

BENJAMIN FRANKLIN
By Carl le Daren.
Carl Van Doren has filled the
need for a scholarly biography of
Benjamin Franklin rather well.

Followmg the tradition of B05-
well and Lockhai-t, he gives us an
informative and accurate work of
cncyclopucdic proportions 1345
pages) which is excellently docu-
mented and notable fol its wclle
chosen quotations.

what will prevent this biogra-
phy fioni appealing to a wide
public of general readers, how-
cvel, is Van Dol'en's style, which
is too sober to fit the man he
is writing about.

While the scllolzi will study
Van Doren. the general reader is
likely to turn back to Bernard
Fey's biography, which. though
often inaccurate and given to un~
supported conjectures, is written
with a liveliness that reflects the
humor of Franklin‘s supple and
rich personality.

It is true that Benjamin Frank-
lin is coming more and more to
be looked at as the greatest man
that the Western hemisphere has
ever producedigl’eat for his poli-
tical, social and scientific signifi-
eonc he could, and did, turn all-
most evory material thing he
touched to human advantage. But
Franklin is greatest for himself
alone!

He had a Capacity to live and
enjoy life that has seldom, if ever,
been equaled. Humor was funda-
mental in him, combined with an
unbounded curiosity, this lively
humor kept him intellectually
healthy during the years of stress
in which he negotiated with the
British parliament for fairness to
the American colonies and with
the government of France for
loans to the American nation.

In van Dorcn's biography, it is
only when Franklin speaks for
himself in the homely ease of his
own wining that we feel we are
in contact with the man.

Van Dolen deserves credit for
his well-placing of well»chosen
quotations, but he is bound to be
blamed for using a style too sober
to be compatible with Franklin's
or Franklin.

He does catch a sp t of drama—
tic intensity once when he writes
of the superb self-control Frank-
lin exerted while Alexander Weds
derburn reviled and abused him
before the members of Parlia~
ment; but, unfortunately, many
similar scenes are glossed over
with cold facts and cannot help
leaving a reader disappointed,

In spite of its faults, Van Dor-
en's “Franklln” demands much
praise. It is accurate and com-
plete. follows the best tradi on:
of biography, even Ll-lougn ranking

oughly happy new year. It is
"farther" (Rusk) our wish that
you will realize that if your toes
are trod upon in this column it
is in the spirit of fun, if it is
possible for anyone to think it is
funny to have their toes trod
upon.

An apology is due. We erroneous-
ly reported that Ward and Evans

and we are sorry.

We have reports that n 10-
eal couple is secretly wed. We are
hot on their trail and hope to
overtake them before Miss Gard-
ner does!
