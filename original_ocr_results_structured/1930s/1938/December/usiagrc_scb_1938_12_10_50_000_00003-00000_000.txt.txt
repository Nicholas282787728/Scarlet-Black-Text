Qualifical’ions
For Graduale
School Given

Four Members of
F aculty Speak at
Vocations Friday

Sophomores, juniors and seniors
heard four members of the faculty
speak at the vocational forum
held yesterday afternoon in the
Alumni Recitation hall auditorium.

This week's forum, under thei
direction of the vocations com-
mittee headed by John w. Pooley.
instructor in business adminisirae
tion, took up the discussion of op-
portunities of doing graduate
work.

Gale Presides.

Introduced by Pooley, Grant 0.
Gale, associate professor of phy—
sics, presided at the meeting.

“Most of graduate school stu—
dents come from small Colleges,”
Gale explained in addressing the
group. “Graduate schools are not
interested in people who come
from universities, because these
universities have graduate schools
of their own.”

Numerous Qualifications

He asserted that graduate
schools have to select their candi-
dates largely irom letters of re»
commendation, and pointed out
that one must have numerous
qualifications if he wishes to up
ply for a fellowship or scholar-
ship.

Graduate schools, he stated,
want to know about one‘s content
of courses, his scholastic record,
his cooperation. team work and
agreeableness, his moral attitude,
responsibility, alertness, applica-
tion, person ity and appearance,
originality, i itative, creativeness,
health and nervous stability, reli-
ability, promptness, reasoning pow-
er, memory, probable research
ability. and accuracy and preci-
sion.

Miss Mussey Speaks.

Gale introduced Miss Frances
Musscy, instructor in zoology,
who pointed out that, although
there are many excellent univer-
sities for graduate work in tho'
United States, the student having
been graduated from a liberal arts
college like Grinnell would find
it just as profitable and beneficial
to choose a university in the Mid-l
dle West.

She suggested that students
wishing to do graduate work get
advice from their major profes-
sors as to planning such work
and as to choosing a university.

George 0. Seiver, assistant pro-
{Essay or French, the next speak-
er, explained that preparation for
graduate school starts in college.

“If you haven't a good record
in college, if you haven't looked
ahead to your topic, forget about
graduate school," he advised.
Advis Personal Talk.

“Visit-“me school where you-
want to go and talk in person
to the professor in your major
line of work," seivcr said. “You’ll
find that this method will often
do you more good than a letter
of recommendation."

Speaking on assistsntships,
Burton 0. Young, instructor in
economics, stated that such posi-
tions are generally offered by the
particular department concerned
and constitute invaluable aid to a

student planning to do graduate
work.
