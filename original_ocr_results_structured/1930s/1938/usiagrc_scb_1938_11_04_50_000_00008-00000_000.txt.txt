GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Rug - Cutters
Throttled by
Wider Skirts

Lérge dresses with wide skirts
and a return to the old style
trains are coming into prominence
in the world style centers ofFal'is.
London, New York. and Holly-
wood. These dresses are extreme-
ly discouraging to jitterhugs and
the torrid dancing that has been
prevalent for the past year.

The advent of the Lambeth
Walk in London is an example of
how these slower dances are
crowding out the wilder forms.
The Big Apple, Susie Q, and the

Shag are falling by the wayside‘

for they cannot he done in the
big dresses.

Jezebel tormais, with the large
wooden hoops tor the shirts, write
a finis to the chapter on "swing."
The hoops present still another
problem, they are hard to pack, in
tact it is best to have two setsi
one for home and one for school.

So when the formal
start here at the style center of
Grinnell, and when the quaditos
make their formal debuts, swing
will be on its way out. We know
that the girls will be in style and
that the meri will be glad. There
are many of us that agree with
the late 0, o. McIntyre, who said:
“Those who invented swing
should."
