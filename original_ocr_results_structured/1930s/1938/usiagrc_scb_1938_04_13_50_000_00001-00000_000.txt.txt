“Met Best Alumni Groups Ever,”
Says Nollen of Eastern Trip

219 Attend Chicago ’—
Meeting; Interest
High Everywhere

“We found about the best
alumni groups we have ever met,”
President John S. Nollen said to-
day in speaking of the recent
eastern trip which he and Robert
Y, Kerr, executive secretary. took
recently to speak to various
alumni groups.

At a meeting of alumni in Chi—
cago. Nollen said, there were 219'
present. All other meetings in
eastern cities were well attended
and those present showed obvious
interest in the alumni association,
he said,

According to Nollen, the pur-

pose of the meetings was to make
more definite plans for alumni
groups and to establish an alumni
fund similar to that of Dartmouth
college, which has all alumni
contribute annually to the college
fund,

This program is to be under the
direction of the rcccntly formed
alumni council, Nollen said.

Several other meetings will be
held during thc ncxt two months,
he said.

One of thc most important of
these will be a meeting in Des
Moincs April 26, in honor of E,
Stenten Turner, '11, who is in the
United states on a furlough from
his position as general secretary
of the Young Men’s Christian as-

representative was seen.
