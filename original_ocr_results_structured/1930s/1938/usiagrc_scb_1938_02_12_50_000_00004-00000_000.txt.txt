fast pace. Their chief difficulty
seems to be a tendency to tire
in the last )0 minutes of the
game. However, they will tire
less easily on the Pioneers- small
floor.

To win, crinnell will have to
set a winning pace from the
start and maintain it to the fins
ish.

With the exception of Fred
Luther, alternate forward, all the
Pioneer players should be ready
to go the route. Luther spent
four days in the hospital with a
sore throat and a touch of influ-
enza this week, and is still weak.
He will, however, he able to play
a portion of the contest.

“One of the fundamental qu’llt
fications for a lawyer is an in-
hoient interest in the law,"c1ydc.
L. McFal'llu. Montezuma attor-
ney, told members ot the Pro
Law club Thursday night.

Pointing out that the proless
sion is overcrowded, he quoted
figures to show that the percen-
tage ot lawyers having high in;
comes is comparatively Small.

The legal profession demands a
broad background and knowledge
in many fields, McFai-liii pointed
out, suggesting that “a little e'r
perienoe in business between pre-
law work and law school would
aid in broadening the student's
viewpoint.

Like so many other independent experts, Bill Whitley,
Tobacco Auctioneer of Henderson, N. C. , smokes Luckies

WILLIAM D. (BILL) WHITLEY sold over 15
million pounds of tobacco last year. It’s
easy to see that he’s an expert who knows tobaccoi

So it’s important to you when he says i ..“At
14 different markets in Georgia, North Carolina,
South Carolina, Tennessee and Kentucky, I’ve
seen Luckles buy the best tobacco. I ﬁgure it’s
good tobacco that makes a good smoke. So my
own cigarette is Lucky Strike!

“I‘ve noticed, too, that independent buyers,
not connected with any cigarette manufacturer,

<6) smoke Luckies more than any other brand.”

a“
I Mr. Whitley is correct. For sworn records
show that, among independent tobacco ex-
perts, Luckies have twice as many exclu-
sive smokers as have all other cigarettes put
together. Remember: The men who know
'g tobacco best smoke Luckies 2 to 1.
