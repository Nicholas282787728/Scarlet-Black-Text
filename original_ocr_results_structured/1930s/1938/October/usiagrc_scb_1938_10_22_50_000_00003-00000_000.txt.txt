Dibble, I4-II:
Gales Wins

Eagles Protest;
Hold Goal Was
Made Illegally

Two close speedball games were
played Wednesday and Thursday
in the intramural league, Smith
winning over Dibble 14~11 and
Gates defeating Clark 13-9.

The Smith»Dibble game was
hotly contested by the iant‘that
Dibble protested one decision that
may cause the game to be re
played. The protest involved a
play in which Smith scored three
points, Dibble argues that the
points were made after the ref-
eree‘s whistle had blown, while
Smith contends that the goal was
scored before the whistle had
blown.

Sage Scores Six mints.

During the first half Kenneth
Sage scored six of Smith's eight
points, while John Shipley added
the remaining two points.

Dave Miller, Don Ward and
James Beisenstein divided up Dib»
ble's six points with two markers
each.

Smith Scores on Pass.

Dibble forged up to even terms
with Smith at the onset of the
second half, but Smith went ahead
10-3 on a pass to Don Ruliffson
from John Turner. Two penalty
shots by Dibble put the Eagles
back on even terms with a few
minutes remaining in the third
quarter. Paul Carlson, in the last
minute of the third canto. con-
verted a free kick to send smith
again into the lead 11-10.

In the final quarter, William
Krepfel scored Dibble’s remaining
point on a free kick to tie up the
score for the last time before
Joseph Woodward provided the
thrill of the game when he made
the field goal that won the game.
Johnson Leads Scaring.

Deficiencies in

College Heal’rh
Programs Found

Washington, D. c.—— (ACP) —
startling deficiencies in the health
programs maintained by U. s. rol-
leges and universities were reveal-
ed here in a survey report i
sued by the American Youth com-
mission.

The survey of 4,716 students in
as colleges conducted by Dr, H.
s, Diehl of the University of
Minnesota and Dr. c. E, Shepard
of Stanford university revealed
the folowing facts:

Approximately 30 percent are
under standard weight by 10 per-
cent or more and more than 5
percent are overweight by 15 per-
cent or more.

Eleven percent or entering
students have uncorrected or
poorly corrected visual errors.

One-third of all entering stu-
dents are infected with tubercu—
IOSIS, but the incidence of Syphilis
is but three-tenths of 1 percent.

A small percent of the colleges
are properly protected against epi-
demics. and a small proportion
