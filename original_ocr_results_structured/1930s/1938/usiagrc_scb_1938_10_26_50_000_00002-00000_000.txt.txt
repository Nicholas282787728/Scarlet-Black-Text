THE INTERNATIONAL
RELATIONS CONFERENCE

The eighth annual Grinnell Student Con-
ference on International Relations will be
held on our campus Friday and Saturday.
The purpose is to pllt an emphasis on san—
ity in our thinking of, and dealings with,
peace, war, and other international prob—
lems.

‘Sanity, of course, in this sense is a ra-
tional mental attitude which we can secure
only by educating ourselves to it This coni-
Ing student conference provides an op—
portunity to learn much concerning the af-
fairs of nations. It offers three distinct
lines of instructionidiscussion groups, lit-
erature, and competent speakers.

_In the round table discussions, students
Will have occasion to express their views on
Mexico, on the use of propaganda in War,
and on our defense against a hypothetical
aggressor nation. If you have any ideas or
questions on any of these subjects, the ap-
propriate round table is the place to talk

about them, A panel discussion by outstand— '

ing Des Moilles men will be held for those
interested in “Making America Safe foi‘
Differences,”

_ For Students interested iii reading about
International affairs and in seeing graplii»
cal_or pictorial representations of relative
national needs and abilities to produce, per-
tinent literature will be’ provided,

The speakers of the conference are able
menr Dr. Hubert Herring, founder and di-
rector of the Committee on Cultural Rela-
tions With Latin America, will speak about
pan-American affairs. Herbert Agar, a
Pulitzer prize Wilmer in writing who has
spent six years ill England, will tell uS
what England wants from lis. Dr. Walter
H C. Loves, who is to discuss the League
of_ Nations, is a lecturer on political
science in the University of Chicago. He has
travelled and studied in Europe, and attend-
ed the seventeenth assembly of the League.
Din Gerhart Seger, a European lecturer

and author, once was a member of the

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

German Reichstag.

Our campus is fortunate that student ef-
forts have provided it with a. group _of
speakers, with literature, and with dis-
cussion groups concerning problems of
world-wide importance. We heartily wol-
come both the delegates and the speakers

to olir college.

THE AMERICAN WAY

Tomorrow night the Grinnell college campus
will be the scene of a lively political debate
on the timely question, “Should the Demo»
ci'atic administration be continued in pow—
er?” Charles Vogel, county attorney and
chairman of the county Democratic come
mittce, will uphold the affirmative, Vogel
will be opposed by C. C. Crisman, clialre
man of the county Republican committee.
Next to the weather, the most discussed
subject in this country is politicsr This is as
it should be, for if democracy is to sure
vivc, the people mllst take an intelligent
interest in our government and its DYIOI}
lems. Political questions become the illi-
mediate concern of every Alncl'ican citizen.
”In these troubled times“ it is hard not_to
compare the condition of the American cltlv
zenry, looking forward with interest to the
fall elections, with that of the silent, hopce
less masses in Germany, Italy or Russia.
Although such a comparison must make
us thank God that we do live iii a country
where truth and reason are still respected,
yet we must not forget that democracy is
on trial today as never before, and that it
is up to us to make our kind of government
work as efficiently as any other kind. For
this reason, the students of Grilinell college
ought to be and are vitally interested in
the way this country is being governed.
Because we believe that discussion and
debate are the pillars of the Americ'tn
form of government, we welcome Mr. Cris-
mail and Mr. Vogel to the campus. The de-
bate will be held in the Clark hall club
room from 7:30 to 8 pm tomorrow, It
will be short to give the audience ample
opportunity for a discussion aftci'war .
You are most cordially invited to attend.

QUIET, PLEASET

With the majority of Grilliiell men living
in the dormitories and studying ili their
rooms, there is little reason for apathetic
attitude of some hall officers toward the
enforcement of quiet hours. The provosm,
whose duty it is to see that the rules of their
respective halls are carried out, are often-
times lax in setting a good example for
others in the hall. There is no legitimate
reason for the dorms to be noisy, especially
after Supper at 7:30 p.m. when studying
begins in earnest. And when the halls are
in Such an uproar that sleep is impossible
until midnight or after—as is often the
case—adjustments should be made.

We know that it iS contrary to tradition
to make a Serious attempt to keep the dorms
quiet dllrilig quiet hours, but we think t at
it’s about time to disregard that tradition
and to face the facts The great majority of
the men are trying to study between the
hours of 7 and 12 o’clock iii the evening.
But still there iS the small minority in each
hall who make it awfully hard for the
rest to get anything done.

Each of the halls has a rule providing for
a quiet period for study in the evening.
Each of the halls has several officers,
among them a provost, The specific duty
of the provost is to enforce hall rules,

Does it Seem unreasonable to demand
that this officer fulfill his obligation to the
men who elected him? Are the men of
Grillilcll asking too much when they ask
for a chance to get their studying done un-
der favorable conditions? The answer is
obvious, Let’s all cooperate to make the
quiet hours rules \vorkﬁto get a. fair
chalice to study and sleep iii peace.

“Indifference to human personality coil-
stitutes a much more serious aspect of
undergraduate life than sex” An article
in the Harvard Advocate, student monthly,
maintains that sex is a “minor” problem
and laid most cases of maladjustment at
Harvard to this indifference.
