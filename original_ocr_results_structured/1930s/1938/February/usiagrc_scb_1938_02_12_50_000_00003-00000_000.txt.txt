The St Louis Symphony oichcstra with i s full quota of 37
players, conducted by Vladimer Golschinann, will give a concert in
2Doeti Moines at the Shrine Auditorium Sunday afternoon February

i

For years the St. Louis Orchestra has been considered one of the
finest in the United states. Last year on its tours it gave 25 con-
certs in 13 states reaching the heights of its acclaim in Chicago,
where the Tribune reported “Golschmann electrified a huge audience
With his masterly interpretation of the Brahms First Symphony '1

When Golschniann took over the orchestra five. years ago after
four ycais of guest conducting hy some of the great contemporary
masters of the haton the orchestra gave its two regular concerts a
week in a hall seating 1800 Two years ago it moved into the Opera
House of the new \meicipal Auditorium, aseating 3600 and most of
tho peitoimances since have been played to full houses

The conductor has found on tours of the orchestra a surprising
demand for the works of modern composers. It was as an exponent
of thc moder that the Russo-Frenchman won his first sensational
success in Paris in 1919. Called “the most complete conductor of our
time" by the authoratative Parisian critic, Andre Coeuroy, he has
conducted orchestras in most of the capitals of Europe and on several
occasions the New York Philharmonic and the New York Symphony.

His concertmaster and assistant conductor, Scipione Guidi. is
famous in his own right. Asknowledged one of the most technically
perfect violinists in America, he was for 10 years concertmastcr of
the New York Philharmonic-Symphony before coming to St. Louis.
Max Steindel, solo cellist and personnel manager of the orchestia
was a child prodigy Before he was 12 he had played betoie royalty
and had been decorated hy King Leopold of Belgium, Ferdinand of
Ruinaiiia Wilhelm of wintemheig, and Piesident Louhet of France.
