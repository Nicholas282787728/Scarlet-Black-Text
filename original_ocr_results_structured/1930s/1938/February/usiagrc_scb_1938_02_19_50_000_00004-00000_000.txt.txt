Meet Washbilrn,
Coming Team, in
Loop Tilt Monday

By Wells Barnett

Their conference standing coils
siderahly honyed up by two vic-
tories last weekend, the Grinnell
cagers Monday will take on one
of the toughest outfits they have
faced in the present home stands
Washburn.

Indications are that Washhui-n
is a comer. The Ichabods start-
ed off slowly this season and lost
to almost everyone in sight with
the exception of Washington and
st. Louis, the cellar champs.

Team Weakencd hy Loss

The loss of Sannenian early in
the season weakened Washhurn
plenty, inasmuch as Sanneman is
supposed to he a good enough
center to grace ally conference
club.

Two weeks a‘go, u-ith Sannemall
still out of the game, the Ichar
hods came suddenly to life,
knocked off Tulsa and Creighton
in succession.

Washhurn, however slipped F
day, losing to Washington 3533.
This puts the Ichabods one and
one-half games behind Grinnell in
sixth place,

That's not all the bad news,
because it is expected that san-
neman will be able to play for a
while Monday. and his presence in
the game will strengthen
ready tough hall cluh.

However, the Pioneers should he
able to heat 'Washhurn if they
play their own game and don‘t
let the Ichahods force them into
an unnaturally fast game, a lit-
tle trick practiced often and suc-
cessfully hy Washhurn and Creigh-
ton.

Pioneers Improve

A great improvement in the
Pioneers play was noticed in sev-
eral instances last weekend, and
if complacency doesn't rear its
disconcerting head, the Pioneers
have the stuff to win.

The starting lineup “’lll consist
of a choice of two forwards from
LaMasney, Conwill and Luther,
with Luiek at center and Dean
and Berry at guards All the men
are in good shape with the excep-
tion of Luick, who is suffering
from intestinal flu, but will he in
shape by Monday.
