Rally Wins
for Blueiays

Creighton Teamv Spills
Pioneers, 34 to 26, im
Loop Battle

Staging a late rally, Creighc
on’s Bluejays outscored Grinnell
cagei , 24 to 22, to win a Mis
sour-i Valley conference game sat-
urday evening.

Trailing initil the last five
minutes, the Jays cracked the
Pioneer defense in a late scoring
flurry for the win

Grinnell led at the halt, in to
18. and was ahead by at least two
points most of the seconds
until cieighton produced ‘:its o
wmning charge.

The defeat practically eliminat—
ed Grinnell‘s chances of winning
the Valley title, for it was the
fifth defeat in nine games.

The Pioneers will continue their
loop competition this week with
St. Louis playing here Saturday
evening and Washingon following
on Monday.

which brings to mind the worri-
an who turned to her companion
was out and re—

hall wasn‘t a rough game. They
told me there wasn't any hcdy

The same lady wanted to know
why one of the boys shot all the
free throws early in the game.
“\Vhy don't they give some of the
other boys a chance? They might
make more baskets,”

Unless something \el'y start-
ling happens in the next month,
it appears that the Ploneers, with
five conference losses as against
four loop wins, are definitely out-
of the championship picture. And
the .Aggics, apparently, are in. We
have a hunch ahout that Aggie
team. howorer, which doesn't
mean that Grinnell will win the
title in the end, hut that Tulsa

or Drake might.

It is our‘ opinion that the Ag-
gies this year are not as good as
they were last year, and that
they are overlooking the fact that
most Valley teams, including
washhurn, Washington and St.
Louis, are considerably improved.
Don't he too surprised if one of
these evenings one of those under-
dog teams rises mightily and
gives Oklahoma at good lacing just
when it is least expected.

And it might he a good idea
for the Pioneers, now that they
meet Washington. Washhuin andl
st. Louis in a row, to rememhcr
that this year, although they're
trailin the conference, those teams‘
are no pushover, and that Grin-
nell is gel g to have to play good
hall to win those games. Expen-
ence has proved, even this year,
that complacency can lose agame.
It \\ill not pay to he complacent
allont these next three games.
