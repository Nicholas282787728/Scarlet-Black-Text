is needed to turn an unsuccessful
season into a good one. If the
Goe team has pointed very much
for this game, the Pioneers are
likely to have some little trouble,
inasmuch as Grinnell has spent
all its time in recent weeks think-
ing about the Creighton and Drake
games.

Coecaptain Hal Dean will still
be unavailable for serVice because
of his broken nose, This will

PIONEERS LOSE THIRD
PLACE STANDING

Pioneer cagers lost a heart-
breaking rlecision and their third
place position in the conference
Thursday night when Creighton's
Blueiays downed them by a 48-46
score after a wild second half.

The Pioneers trailed at half-
time by a 15717 score, and barely
failed to make up the difference
in a high scoring period.

Conwill led the Pioneer scoiing
with 15 points, followed by
Luther, who jumped into second
place in conference scoring with
a total of 13 points. Shaw was
high for Creighton with 11 points,
LaMasney, who took Dean's place
at guard, played an outstanding
game in his unfamiliar position.

in Scoring Spree
with 50-7 Score

Tho-intramural baskctlrall’crown
was aunexod by Dibble hull this
morning when Rawson was defeat-
ed 50 to 7, The Dibble scoring
sprce was led by Bicse‘nstein who
dumped in nine buckets and a free
throw for a total of 19 points.

The end of the first quarter‘
found the northenders covetilig a
lead of 10 points which they had
garnered while Rawson was still
trying to pocket their initial goal.
The second quarter was a nip and
tuck affair which found Rawson’s
Edward Harvey connecting with
two field goals while Dibble could
connect only once,

The eagle guardians hit their
stride in the final stanza and
bucketed away on a 33 point
spree. All Rawson could do was
get a free toss by Harvey, and one
basket by Holstead.
