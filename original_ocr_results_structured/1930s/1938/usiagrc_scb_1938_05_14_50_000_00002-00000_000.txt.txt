DISCUSSION IMPORTANT

In view of the definite interest shown
on the campus this year in plans for the
publication of an annual, it has beell decided
to hold a chapel Monday for the express
purpose of discussing the possibilities of
such plans.

At the chapel certain figures will be
revealed which are an answer to ad—
ministration criticism of the proposed fi-
nancing plans. At that time it will be
possible for students and faculty to come
out in the open and give in open meeting
their objections to the plans.

It is important that all who are in-
terested in the question of an annual
whether for or against it, should be in
chapel Monday to express their views, for
it is only through such frank discussion
that the question can be settled sensibly.

KID TRICKS

While the administration spends a con-
siderable amount of money in a genuine
effort to beautify the campus, a certain clez
ment among the student body, flushed with
their own “cuteness,” and apparently cer—
tain that their ideas on decoration are
superior to those of others, spent last night
“landscaping” the campus with festoons of
tissue paper.

We can almost feel pity for college
students of such low mentality, for such
actions inevitably remind us of high school,
or, worse than that, grade school tactics.

We are not in favor of cutting down
on anyone’s fun, but Such kiddish pranks
lnust be dispensed with.

THE “OLD ARMY GAME"

(OR THE ART OF MAKING EVERYONE
A SUCKER BUT YOURSELF)

In spite of the recent handclasps in
Rome and the dramatic display of military
friendship it is now certain that Mussolini
no longer holds the ace of trumps in the
Rome-Berlin axis, and as a result his atti—
tude toward Germany is one of close watch-
fullless rather than friendliness. ,

Heretol‘ore, the situation was one of
Berlin asking the assistance of Rome, but
with the sudden absorption of Austria no
further favors need be asked, and in fact
Italy must seek the assistance of Berlin in
the future. This puts an entirely different
complexion on European affairs.

Germany doesn’t need to ask for the
acquiescence of Italy in her plans to make
Czechoslovakia a satellite; Italy has to
acquiesce This means then that the Rome-
Berlin axis no longer has the dynamic power
it once had. Mussolini doesn‘t like this

position, and he can be depended on to try

to escape it by playing Germany off against
England and France, and vice versa when-
ever the situation suits him, in order to
keep himself from being under Hitler’s
thumb. Hitler knows this and we can be
sure that no commitments other than tem-
porary expediency have been made.

The old game of diplomatic chess is in
full swing, move is followed by counter
move, action by reaction and cross by
double-cross. It’s the “old army game" of
trying to make a sucker out of every one
but yourself.

LENTHERIC

OFF THE CAMPUS

By John Spawning

WASHINGTON, n. C.-—In an
overwhelming reversal of the ex-
pected decision, Congress voted
329-70 to pass the much maligned
3 billion dollar “spending for re-
covery" bill.

The vote is particularly signi-
ficant in that it is conclusive proof
that Roosevelt has not lost his
influence in Congress. Previously,
it had been thought that the
current revolts against the ad-
ministration signified the decline
of the New Deal.

Now, on the contrary. the pres,
ent vote indicates that ms nu-
ministration can still command the
support of, not only the demo-
crats, but enough republicans to
give a large congressional ma~
jorily.

only the day beiore, however,
the house passed by a vote of
242-39 3 bill which would re
duce the administration's unpop-
\llar undistributed profits tax.
