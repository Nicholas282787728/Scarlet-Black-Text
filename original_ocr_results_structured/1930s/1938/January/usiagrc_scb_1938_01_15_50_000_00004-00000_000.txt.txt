Veteran Jim Edwards
tells why tobacco experts
prefer Luckies 2 to 'I ..

“I recently sold 489,000 pounds
oftobacco in one 61/2 hour day,"
says Mn}. N. Edwards of Farm-
ville, North Carolina.

"There was a buyer, naturally,
for every one of those 489,000
poundsnlBu! there was as much
diﬂ‘erencebetween thebestgmdes
and the inferior, as between a
pretty girl and a homely one.

“At auction after auction, I’ve
seen Lucky Strike go after the
prettiest lots of tobacco. It’s no
wonder Luckies taste so good.
I’ve smoked them since 1917.

“And another thing . . . even
after yelling out tobacco bids

all during a seven hour day,
Luckies are still just as easy as
ever on my throat.”

Only Lucky Strike offers you
the ﬁnest tobacco plus the throat-
protection of the exclusive proc-
ess “It’s Toasted”. This process
takes out Certain irritants found
in all tobaccoieveu the ﬁnest.

Men who know tobacco from
Ato Ziexperts like Mr. Edwards
eare surely good judges of ciga-
rettes ...Swom records show that,
among independent tobacco ex-
perts, Luckies have twice as many
exclusive smokers as have all the
other cigarettes combined.
