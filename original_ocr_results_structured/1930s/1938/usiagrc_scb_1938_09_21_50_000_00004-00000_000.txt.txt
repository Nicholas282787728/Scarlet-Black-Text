Problem Up

Eligible Sophomores
and Juniors Meet
With Duke Friday

By Clark A. Smith

Before the men's intramural
season can get under way, G. Les—
ter Duke, director of mtramurals,
most locate three juniors to act
as managers. In recent years, the
Grinnoll managerial system has
suffered from a shortage of man-
ages, but this year, Duke says, he
hopes to remedy that evil.

Both sophomores and juniors
are needed to put the system into
effect. Any men in those classes
that are interested in becoming
managers are urged to meet with
Duke Friday afternoon at 5 p.m.
in the men's gymnasium. At that
time, he says he hopes to meet
with enough candidates so as to
insure the future of Grinnell in-
tramural and varsity athletics for
the next two or three years.

Experience Gained

The managerial system in use
at Grinnell is unique in that the
successful sophomore tryouts gain
experience in both intramural and
varsity athletics.

Briefly, the system'is as fol-
lows: At the beginning of each
year any number of' sophomores
may present themselves at the
gym signifying their intentions to
try out tor managerial positions.
They will then be assigned to
work as assistants to the varsity
managers.

Choose Six Juniors

At the end of thesehool year,
six junior or intramural managers
will he chosen from the sophomore
tryouts. Two junior managers
will be assigned to each intra-
mural season. and, in conjunction
with the intramural director, will
run the sports o1 their respective
seasons

At the end of the junior year,
three senior or varsity managers
will be chosen and will serve as
manager of one varsity sport dur~
ing the senior year. in the event
that the man chosen for varsity
manager is unable to fill his posi-
tion during the senior year, his
place will he filled by one of the
three unsuccessful junior candi—
dates. Those expecting to he can»
didates for varsity teams are not
eligible for managerial positions.
