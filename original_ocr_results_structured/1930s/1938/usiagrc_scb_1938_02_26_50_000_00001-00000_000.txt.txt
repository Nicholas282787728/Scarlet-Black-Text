The Pioneers will attempt to
win another non-conference balk
game tonight, taking on One col-
lege at Cedar Rapids. In an
earlier game the Pioneers defeat—
ed Coe 38-31 on the Grinnell
floor.

On paper, the Pioneers should
have little difficulty With the
Kohawks. Coe has fallen to al»
most everyoie in their own league
and has been kicked around prete
ty badly this season. On the other
hand, the Grinnell team has
proven in the last few games
that it is a team with very high
scoring tendencies.

The only point in (3055': favor
is the fact that they will in all
likelihood be really ready for this
tilt. With a bad season behind
them now, a win over Grinnell

‘Pldy of Thousand Laughs’--
Reporter’s Idea of ‘Androcles’

Describes Ewart
as Funniest Caesar

liver to Trad Boards

A reporter of the Scarlet and
Black, who went to the drama
department yesterday to get a
story on “Androcles and the Lion,"
which will be presented by the
department Wednesday, Thursday
and Saturday nights, returned to
the office saying the play is the
"funniest" thing he has ever seen,
even though he has bccn a spice»
tator at rehearsals three times.

This scribe turned aside his
writing- responsibilities for it
moment, he said, and oven helpcd
sew curtains, as he watched a
fitting of val Luck‘s costume.

“Funny" seemed to be about
the only word he could use in
dcsoribing what he called “a play

 

of a thousand laughs,”

“Dauphin Ewart is the funniest
Caesar that ever trod the boards,"
he laughed. “He loses 10 pounds
in every practice when the Lion,
Robert Hagen, chases him."

He described the cast’s efforts
to be serious in rehearsal. and
said that, when Margaret Currier
hits Harry Duncan with a flying
tackle, “it's so funny that even
Duncan laughs.”

The reporter described the
scenery as the most elaborate and
beautiful ever to be used in a
Grinllell production .

Wendell Butler, Eugene Savage
Shirley Evans, and Harry Lang-
laiid have serious roles, but seem
to have a difficult time playing
them because of ”their difficulty
in keeping straight faces."

“Take a thousand laughs, excels
.lcnt acting, add beautiful scenery
and a pinch of brilliant costumes,"
said the i-cpoitci, “and you have
iAndlocles and the Lion'"

Italians United
by Ideas Greater
Than Themsel [ties

”The Italian people are essen i
tially primitive, selfish, and gr i
garious," was the
statement in a d e l
by Walter Kotsch- i
nig, in his third 1
lecture Wednesday -
night, on “Italy'
The Imperial'
Myth." Tho speaks
or added that the
wants of the Ital- ‘
ian are extremely_ .
simple, and that hOTSCHNlG-
he is a materialist above every
thing else.

Kotscbnig went on to say that,
contrary to popular opinion, the
italian forces in the world war
had been more of a liability than
an asset to the Allies, in spite of
the fact that modern Italian text
books state that the decisive bat-
tle of the war was won by Ital-
ian forces,

The speaker continued with a
story of Mussolini's rise to power,
starting in 1922. and climaxmg
with his triumph over the League
of Nations in the Ethiopian affair.

“Mussolinl’s belief was that
unity could only be established by
inspiring the Italians with ideas
greater than themselves," Kotsch-
nig stated.
