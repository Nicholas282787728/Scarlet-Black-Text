TO NEW STUDENTS

Iowa has never been more beautiful than
this spring and summer. Frequent rains
at the right time have kept the landscape
green, the cornfields are heavy with the
promise of abundance, the campus is at its
best, the Grinnell lawns are an expanse of
smooth verdure, and houses in town are
taking on white paint by the ten. When
the old guard comes back in September, it
will find its collective heart responding to
the ”quiet beauty of Grinnell" like an
Aeolian harp in a Zephyr.

As for you who will be making your first
contact with Grinnell, we wish [or you all
the joys and satisfaction that have thrilled
so many generations of your predecessors
You will find ample opportunity here for
the development of all your talents and for
the realization of your ideals. You will find
new friendships, a wider outlook, kindly
interest and guidance, a wealth of intcl»
lectuzll and spiritual riches, and a variety of
activity suited to your needs. No doubt you
come here with a determination to make
the most of these opportunities, and we
who are older will be watching with the
keenest interest your growth in wisdom and
power. We shall expect you to take ser-
iously the challenge that a college education
offers you, and to justify all that is being
done, by your parents and the College, to
give you this chance at a liberal education
Your predecessors on the campus have
shown a fine quality of leadership here in
their upper-class years, and have followed
up this record with signal service afterward
to the community and the nation, May you
succeed in keeping up this tradition and
carrying it to even greater heights!

' (Signed)
John St Nollen, President
Grinnell College

COOPERATION NEEDED

When the board of trustees met June 3
and passed final approval on the plan to
take $2 from each students room deposit to
help finance a student annual for next year,
the incoming junior class cleared the last
hurdle in a Ion ' fight to gain a strong f'
nzincial foundation on which to stand in
publishing a year book next spring

It was a long, hard struggle but the class
of 1940 now stands ready to begin work on
the book which, according to all indications,
will be one of the best ever produced at
Grinnell. The class has picked a stal to
publish the annual, This staff will begin
work as soon as school opens, and judging
from the show it made in fighting for its
plan, Grinnell students can rest assured
that they will get an annual to be proud of.

However, favorable student opinion, in-
tense student interest, nnd complete student
cooperation will be needed to make the
annual “hot you all want it to be,

It is our hope that September will find
the student body of new and old students
100 per cent behind the junior class,

DO IT NOW

The summer holiday is by tradition (and
we hope in practice) a time reserved by
Grinnellinns for rest and relaxation, coupled
with a modicum of work. Often it is also a
time during which the problems of college
may be completely laid aside,

We hope the latter is not the case with
loyal Grinnellians, be they past, present or
future, Not that we have anything against
a carefree holiday, but rather that we hope
Grinnell is of such importance to you that
it and its problems may not be lightly put
aside,

This issue of THE SCARLET AND
BLACK marks the passing of half the va-
cation period. Within a few weeks you will
meet on the campus, many of you for the
first time, othels to renew old friendships,

You have already heard, not once, but
many times, that what you receive from
your college years depends directly on what
you put into those years. It is also true
that what you receive depends on whzlt you
give, Such a situation puts upon you a
grave responsibility.

It is toward that end that we ask you to
consider your plans for the coming year,
now, before you get to Grinnell, ‘

Foresight is an essential factor in loader—
ship. When you return to Grinnell, or when
you enter Grinnell for the first time, you
will see all about you evidences of leader—
ship and organization Much of this work
will have been done by student leaders, men
and women who are getting everything
possible out of college by giving time and
thought to campus problems, nmvi

You may get more benefit from your
college years if you will give of your best
and do it now. You are the men and wo-
men whose ideas are of importance to Grin-
nell college. You are the ones who can
make Grinncll college better or worse, and
in so doing benefit or harm yourselves.

You, the students of Grinnell college,
know better than any other group what
Grinncll, needs. For Grinnell is nothing
more or less than what you make it.

Organized student opinion during the past

year was responsible for the organization of
he White House, the development of the
weekly quiz plan of examinations, the pros
vision of increased funds for the band and
other projects of vast importance to Grin»
null.

Yet, with all its advantages, Grinnell is
not perfect. New problems are constantly
arising. New opportunities for a more
complete education are ever needed. Those
who are most active in solving these prob»
lenis and in seeking these new opportunities
will profit lnost from their college years.
In addition, they will have the satisfaction
of making it possible for others to profit
from their college years to the utmost,

There is always room for those who can
reach the top. There is always a. demand
for leaders. Now is the time for you to
reach the top, to join the select company
of those who lead.

 

OFF THE CAMPUS

Tho, much talked of purge cl
Anti New Deal Democrats in VHV

be the reason [or the President’s
present tour, has failed to mater»

with the possible exceptions of
Kentucky and Oklahoma, the Pres

telanccs which might widen the
rift between the two branches of

less, Lite trip has undoubtedly
widened the breach between old

spite a probable governmental
deficit of four and onerhoif billion,
most experts look rm- business to
assume boom proportions.

uub every state in the Union
excepting Virginia doling out
funds {or old age assistance, and
Virginia’s plan awaiting approval
by the Social security board, pub-
lic assistance of the aged and
needy has become an accepted
fact. Only three major ditiicur
ties now obstruct the successful
operation of the planﬁlaxlty in
determining need, lack oi skilled
administrators, and lack of reali-
zation that public assistance
must he a service as well as a
doling out of funds.

First Howard Hughes started

up in New York after circling

That‘s at least one respect in
which Lindbergh still has the
edge, He landed where he said he
would.

to the plans of Air Secretary Sir
Kingsley Wood. In the last war
the women were supposed to sit

have to go barefoot or knit their
