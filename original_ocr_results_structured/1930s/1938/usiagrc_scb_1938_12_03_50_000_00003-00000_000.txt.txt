Band Director at

High School

Praises Friday Night Concert
By Paul W. Behm. e:

A near capacity audience, last
night in Herrick chapel, heard
the music of the Grinnell college
band under the leadership of R0»
bert Vagner.

That everyone was entertained
was evidenced by the prolonged
applause after each number and
by the spirit of good feeling that
one eimei senses or does not
sense at such a gathering.

The concert opened with the
"Parade of the Gendarmes," a
French march. This difficult num~
her is arranged by Lake and was
well done.

The “Overture Militaire," based
on themes from Haydn’s Military
Symphony, would be my choice of
the entire program. The work is
arranged by Skronika, who is the
instrumental music supervisor in
the public schools of Milwaukee.
it is well written for band and
was especially well done last
night. -

A vocal solo, “On the Road to
Mandalay," by F. Walter Huff—
man, was enthusiastically i-
ceived by the audience, and it r
ouir d an encore of the same
number to satisfy everyone.

George Hirschman was featured
on the vibrapbone in two num-
bers, “Stardust‘ and “Bells
Across the Meadow.” These num-
bers, particularly “Stardust,”
were much enjoyed.

One could not help but be im-
pressed hy the size of the band.
There were more than fifty pe
formers which is an increase over
past years.

I think that we can expect a
great deal of this organization in
the future. It would not take

much to make the instrumental»
tion complete. At least twelve
more clarinets are needed. An alto
clarinet, two bassoons and two or
three more sousaphones would
place at the disposal of a more
than competent director the tools
necessary to make music that
everyone enjoys.

Money Divided.

This fund will then be divided
by the board between the Scarlet

end of the year, some or the fund
still remains, 75 per cent of the
balance will go into a reserve to
be used for permanent improve-
