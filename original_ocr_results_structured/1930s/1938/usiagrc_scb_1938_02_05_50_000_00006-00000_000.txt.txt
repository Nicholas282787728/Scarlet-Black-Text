Stinchfield Paintings on
Display in Main Hall
Until Feb. 28

An exhibit of five water colors
hy Miss Estelle Stinchfield was
hung in Main hall corridor today
and will extend through Feb. 25,
according to Miss Edith stein-
feld, assistant professor of art.

Miss stinchfleld is an instinct-
or in painting and history of art
at Colorado state college, Greeley,
Colo. She has studied in Paris
under Andre L'Hote, a modernist
painter. and is a member of the
National Association of Women
Painters and Sculptors.

Miss Stinchﬁeld does much ex-
hihiting, and one of her paint-
ings in the present grotip was re-
cently displayed at the dedication
exhibit for the opening of the
new art gallery at the University
of Colorado, Boulder, Colo.

The exhibit includes “Lands
scape at Lyons,” "The Mel'l'yvgo-
round," “The Melon Market," and
two studies of horses,

said, most of the women corres-
pondents at the capital will tell
you that Eleanor Roosevelt is
beautiful. “Her features are not
beautiful," she said, “but she
radiates an inner beauty which
rises from her enthusiasm and
iii’iselfishness."
Conierences

The President's press contor-
ences are completely informal,
Mrs. Roiitt said. The president
calls the writers by their first
names, and jokes with them cone
stantly. Once when President
Roosevelt had mentioned at the
start of a press conference that
there was little news that day
and that the writers probably
knew as much of what was going
on as he did, the correspondent
for the Associated Press spoke
up with a loud "Oh. Yeah?"

In contrast, _lvlrs. Routt said,
Secretary Hull's conferences with
newspapermen are models of de-
corum. "secretary Hull," she
said, ‘is one of the tow real
statesmen left in Washington. He
is completely surrounded with an
impressive air of dignity."

Anecdote

An amusing anecdote ahout
Senator J. "Ham” Lewis, the pink-
whiskered legislator from Illinois,
was also contributed by Mrs.
Routt, Lewis is known for his
gallantry, and is constantly makr
ing nice compliments to his
women associates. It is the cus-
tom of his brother senators when
they overhear a particularly com-
pliment to remark, ‘Your cone
cience has no more to do with
your gallantry than with your
politics.”

Mrs. Roiitt described Secretary
of Labor Frances Perkins as
having a very precise mathematics
al mind which can do wonders

In 1873, Senior
Class Expelled;
Only 2 Graduate

The oldest living woman gradu-
ate of Gl'innell, Mrs. T. J. Noll,
33, of Gl'innell, recalled this
Week the smallest class in the
school’s history when she was
reminded that the present senior
group is one of the largest.

The small class was in 1873
when all 23 members were ex

Unable to ltocite.

The first rumble of trouble
began when one of the men in
the Latin class was unable to res
cite when called upon. Professor
Lewis, losing his temper, told the
class that he refused to instruct
a class so poorly prepared.

Angered that the whole class
should be blamed for one person's
mistake, the men stuffed the
drafts in the wood—burning stove
in the classroom. At the next
recitation when the fire was lit,
it smoked so much that the pier
fessor was forced to dismiss
class.

Chapel Compulsory.

In those days, chapel attend—

next day's service, Pres. George

The purposes of the group as

" OFTEN invest $2500 a week

own hard-earned cash,” says
Mr. Barnes. “So you can see that
the only way I’ve stayed in busi-
ness 10 years is to know tobacco.

“Now I know Lucky Strike to-
bacco and it’s top-grade. That’s
Why I’ve smoked Luckies for
eight years now

“Lots of other independent
buyers, auctioneers, and ware-
housemen I know smoke Luckies
for the same reason.”

Yes. sworn records show that,
among independent tobacco ex-
perts like Mr. Barnes, Luckies
have over twice as many exclu—
