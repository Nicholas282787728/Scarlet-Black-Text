REVOLT IN GERMANY

To our mind the current revolt in Germany is the ob-
vious result of a policy of dictatorship such as has existed

in Germany since the advent of Hitler.

It is an historical fact that when agovernment be-
comes powerful enough to suppress opposition, that oppo-
sition smoulders with increased rapidity until either open
revolt flares up or a stricter censorship and control must
be applied. Thus of necessity, power ever begets power.

Admittedly,
causes for the present situation in Germany, _
purposes it is sufficient. For we are primarily interested
in the effect of this new move on the rest of Europe and
the world.

The burning question is the one of German intervention
in European affa s. The handful of officers who now con-
trol Germany are the most agressive of leaders, and Euro»
pean statesmen are obviously worried that they may
initiate a. plan of aggression, in Spain and elsewhere. Mean—
while they burn the midnight oil in the capitals of Europe
preparing for the crisis which may not come

SPRING (‘2) HOUSEPARTIES

The dates set for the second semester houseparties
have again provoked comment by .various students as to
whether at least half of the parties can be logically de—
signated with the title “Spring.”

We realize that tllere are only a certain number of
Saturday’s iii the semester and that there are certain soc \I
functions which are by tradition in the spring, but it does
seem that the middle of March is a little early for “Spring”
to girl" le.

Might it not be possible to plan in the future to have
more varsities at the beginning of the semester and save
later dates for the holisepartics. After all, by March a
young man’s fancy hasn’t even had time to awaken from its
winter lethargy, much less turn.

“Are those leaving our colleges different from the
masses, except for their interest in football tickets on the
50 yard line 7" Dr. Robert G. Sproul, president of the Uni-
versi y of California, thinks that 85 per cent of the students
in junior colleges are not of college caliber and should not
go on to higher education.

“Civilization has advanced, in my opinion, not because
of any improvement of mental quality in the masses but
rather because the realization of the material advantages
to be gained from the toleration of genius has slowly per-
colated into the minds of the majo ity of our species." Dr.
Earnest A. Hooton, professor of anthropolgy and curator
of Peabody Museum at Harvard, argues that social, material
and intellectual pt gress are always the result of the effort
of the gifted individual,

“One rarely finds a European college student working
his way through school. Even if we should get a-job it is
very probable we would not get money for i Our pay
would be the valuable experience we received from the job.”
Fobei't Forster, foreign exchange student from Switzerland
at Ohio State uiiivel-sit praises the initiative of American
students who work their way through school.

INTERPRETED BY

BERLIN, GERMANY e Iliitilit»
:ed by the revolt of the German
army last week, events there this
week led rapidly to an ultimate
conclusion, concentration of come
plete power over all phases of
German life in the hands of Hit
ler and a few tr ~ted lieutcnants,

Lenders oi the revolt inn-e been
Ireplaccd by men whose loyalty
to Hitler is unquestioned, The
army has been trained in the
,supprcssion of possible uprisings

‘and plans are being made for a,

replacement of certain foreign
ambassadors with loyal Nazis.
.So for as Europe in general is
concerned, the Situation is impor-
italit in that there is under the
‘new regime a more warlike, ag-
gressive leadership in Germany;
land the question arises as to
how far they will pursue their
already aggressive attitude, par»
ticnlarly in spain.
\VASKIINGTON—Sccretary of
State Cordell Hull this week
made two assertions, one that the
United states is Willing to reduce
armaments, and the other that

what Japan plans in the line of
naval defense.

When it became evident that
Japan had no intention, either of
,reducing her navy, or oven mak-
iing public her plans, citizens of
idle United states were forced to
,resign themselves to the specte-
cle of another great naval and
armaments race, remembering
meanwhile that Just such a race
preceded the World war.

it YORK—Top news in the
field of labor this week was the
‘exteiiSion for an indefinite period
by United States Steel, of the
01,0. charter for the industry.
Acceptance, with provision for a
lintei- revision of the wage scale,
came in the face of a price cut
by “little steel" throughout the
cost.

WASHINGTON — Noteworthy,
,too, was the action of the AF.
of L, in suspending from mcmv
bersliip tin-cc basic unions of the
010,, United Mine Workers,
‘olnss Blowe , and Mine, Mill and
sincltor Wei-hers.
