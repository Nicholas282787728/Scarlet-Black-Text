Campaign in 1938-39

Bob Berry, junior- guard, was
elected captain oi the 1933-39
haskethall team after the annual

Lu’rher Breaks
Individual Record
For High Scoring

Fred Luther, flashy Pioneerior-
ward, has set a new irid' idual
oneyear Grinnell basketball scor-
ing record, Coach John a. Trues—
dale announced today, iLuther
has scored 65 field goals and 34
free throws for a total of 169
points.

Tire only other Pioneer» who
would have a claim on that record
is Fred Benz. an oldtimc star,
whose complete record is unknown
hut who amassed a large point
total. However, Benz made his
points under the rules that al-
lowed one man to shoot all the
free throws. As a result, recs
ords show him scoring from eight
to 20 irec throws a game and
only a few field goals, which
makes the basis of comparison
untair.

In second place in the one-year
totals is Richard Mason, who got
145 points in the 1934-35 season.
Mason is also second in thcthrec-
year scoring total with 340 points
for his varsity career.

Leading the three year scorers
is Hank Duncan, a star from 1930
to 1933, who scored 369 points in
his three years 0[ competition.
Luthc‘r. who scored only three
points last year because of an in
jury which kept him out most of
the season, has a theoretical
chance or passing that mark, but
will have to set anotlrcr new rcc-
ord o[ 207 points to do it. That
contingency is pcssihlc, consider
ing that Luther has played only

Trailing Luther in this year's
scoring are Luiek with 125, Can—

110 points. Luick, who has scored
229 points so far in two years, al-

creaking the threeyear record,
provided he steps up his scoring
pace a little next year.
