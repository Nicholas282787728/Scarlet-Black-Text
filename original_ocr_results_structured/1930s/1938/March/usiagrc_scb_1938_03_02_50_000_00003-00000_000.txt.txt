Lois Wahl while she was working
switchboard Thursday night as
was apparent in the caller. A
young lady, calling [mm the chap
el, was almost unmanageable in
her alarm. Finally, after ouieting
licr, Lois was able to find out
that the girl was Lucie stern.
The cause for her alarm was that
it was intermission. She was
back stage without a program and
didn't know what she was to play
next, After calming Miss stern,
Lois called the “lihe” and had
someone bring a program over to
the pianist so that “the show
might go on.”

Committee Named
to Study Campus
Social. Problem

The Young Men's Christian as-
sociation Will investigate the so-
cial problem of Grinnell as _a res
sult of the failure of the first
mixed dinner of the year. Thomas
KCehn, president, said today.

The problem at present, which,
according to Keelin. represents
the sentiment of the student govA
crument organizations. is that a
good pcrocntago of the students
that
present no opportunities for nor
mal social contacts

“The feeling we have," Keehn
pointed out. “is that we did not
convrnce the student body that
the mixed dinners would prove to
be on aid in solving our campus
problem."

Koehn stated that the Y. M. c.
A. has appointed a committee to
thoroughly investigate the mat.
tcr, and determine student semis

alley from the College Shop is
convinced that it sells beer be—
cause the Budweiser truck stops
there. Only she calls it the “End-
weezer" truck. For a while she
believed Prof. Colbert when he
said that the truck also carried
pop. Everything was fine, until
one day the lady called Colbert
and told him to look up the alley.
There, at the some time, were the
“Budweezeid' truck and a pop
truck making deliveries. Now
Colbert doesn‘t know what to say.
