AFTER ELECTION-WHAT?

Now that the freshmen and junior
classes have elected new officers and the
sophomore class is about to do so, We are
moved to consider the pertinent question of
the value of these officers.

It is a well known tendency for groups
of all sorts to organize and elect officers on
the slightest provocation without regard to
the necessity or functions of such officials.
Certainly, with but few exceptions, class
elections here have been ample proof of this
tendency.

Aside from the purely honorary con-
siderations involved, class offices are, so
far as we can see, but hollow mockeries,
their holders officers in name alone.

No we do not want to see class offices
abolished. We would far rather have the
class officers become important factors in
the student leadership of the campus.

Student apathy to class elections is
conclusive proof that the time has come for
class officers to justify their existence.

Actions speak louder than words. To
the new officers we give the question. Your
deeds must furnish the answer.

AFTER ELECTION7WHAT?

A BAND IN THE MAKING ’

In a recent editorial we took occasion
to congratulate the band on its fine show-
ing and compliment it on the playing of
“Tiger Rag," etc, as pep songs for basket-
ball games.

In the back of our mind at that time
was the thought that perhaps the renewed
vigor of the band would encourage more
students to participate ill it. Such, un-
fortunately, has not been the case.

May we suggest then, that while we
now have a band with plenty of spirit and
of ample size for basketball games, it is not
a big enough band for many other occasions.
There is at present a finer nucleus for a
real-honest-to-god-he-man—band t han we
have had for many years. Now is the time
for students to come to the support of it
and make the band what it can well be.

EXPERIENCE TO IUSTIFY
RESPONSIBILITY

The most recent revision of the regu-
lations pertaining to the unlimited out pri-
vilege strikes us as a decided step in the
right direction toward liberalization of the
cut plan as a whole.

The amended plan applies to many

more students than did the old and we are
confident that experience will justify the
increased reponsibility given the students.

“LEFTIST” TENﬁCIES

In line with the ever-recurring accusations
that college campuses are hotbeds of com-
munism, a recent survey taken at Iowa State
college is interesting, if humorous in its im-
plications.

As to the importance of these finds, we
refuse to hazard a guess. Rather we would
like to have you judge for yourselves.

Of 100 girls observed while taking an
exam, 74 had their legs crossed. Of these
54 were to the left and only 20 to the right.
In addition to this, 13 were left handed.

Obviously this survey, showing as it
does, well developed “lei’tiest” tendencies
among college students, is startling.

What does it mean, revolution, ‘chaos,
anarchy? Your guess is as good as ours.
Personally, we’re going home.

ARE THE MILLIONS FOR DEFENSE?

(Reprinted from Southern California
Trojan)

California's Senator Hiram Johnson last
week asked a question which for quite some
time has been in the minds of all liberal
thinkers in the country when he wanted to
know what the “foreign policy of this gov-
ernment is. ”I don‘t know what it is. You
don’t know what it is." And often we won-
der whether the president himself knows
what it is. If we are to judge his thoughts
by his public utterances (and of course, we
are to do nothing of the kind!) it would
seem highly probable that he is not at all
sure what it is or what it is to be.

After paying lip service to peace for five
years he comes out ’for the largest peace-
time appropriation for armaments in the his-
tory of the United States strictly “for
national defense.” Perhaps that is the sole
reason for the proposed navy increase, but
again a clarifying of issues would help.
Does national defense mean ships 600 miles
up the Yangtze river in China or no further
than Hawaii? It seems that in the minds of
the governmentithough again we cannot
be sure—that national defense means de-
fending Standard Oil’s right to exploit the
interior of China; else why this sudden de-
mand for increasing a navy which already
is second only to Great Britian‘s‘l

We cannot possibly be expecting armed
conflict with Great Britian; that fact at
least we can take for cei‘tainwespecially
after the recent secret conferences between
naval big-wigs of the two countries. If
Great Britian is not to be the enemy from
whom we must “defend” ourselves, then it
must be one of the fascist powers, probably
Japan. Now, how is Japan with a naval
strength only tuothirds as great as our
present strength to transport enough men
and machines across the thousands of miles
of Pacific ocean to menace in any way our
western coast? Experts all over the coun-
try, in their saner moments, agree that such
a feat would be impossible. Why then does
the government insist on disguising its pro—
posed armament outlay with the mask of
“national defense?"

THEY EXONERATE HIM NOW...

(Reprinted from the Daily O’Collegian)

Twenty-one years after the United States
entered the World War, the people return
to some degree of sanity, and realize that
those who oppose war may have some
grounds for their position.

Prof. William Schaper has been exone-
rated by the University of Minnesota of the
crime he committed in 1917 by opposing
the entrance of the United States into the
world conflict.

Coming only one score and one years
after'the occurence of the incident, Pro»
lessor Sdiaper is, no doubt, deeply touched
by their penitent action. He probably
cared a lot now whether they ever forgave
him or not; especially, since he cared so
little what they thought of him them.

Chorus Members
Plan to Organize
Antiphonal Choir

An alitiphonal choir will be or»
ganized from the membership of
the Pioneer chorus within the
next two weeks, F. Walter Huff-
man, director of the chorus, an-
nounced today.

In antiphonal singing, accord-
ing to Huffman, an echo effect is
obtained by having a secondary
choir repeal the lilies of the origi-
nal choir.

Three numbers have been se-
lected for the group. They are
“The Echo Song,” by DeLasso;
“Gloria Patri,” by Palestrina and
“Misericordian Domini,” by Dur-
ante. »
