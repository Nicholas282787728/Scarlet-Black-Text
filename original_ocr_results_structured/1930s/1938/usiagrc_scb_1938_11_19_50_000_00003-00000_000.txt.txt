SATURDAY,

Coul’rer, FBI,
Talks Monday

Pre Law Group to
Be Host to G-Man
In Clark Club Room

R. c. Coulter, special agent in
charge of the Des Moines branch
of the Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation, will tell about the work
of his office before an open meet-
ing of the Pro Law club Monday.

Mr. Coulter's appearance on the
Gi-innell campus is in response to
the enthusiasm by the student
body last year when a G—man of
the Omaha, Neb., branch of the
RBI. spoke here.

The program will he held in the
Clark hall club room at 7:30 p,
m., according to Frederick L.
Baumann, sponsor of the Pl‘e Law
club.

Frederick Homann, president of
the group, stated that Mr. Coul-
ter would probably give instruc—
tions to a member of each hall
on how to take ﬁngerprints.

Last week, the men’s halls vot—
ed to approve fingerprinting of
all men, the prints to be placed in
a civil file in Washington, D.c.

Everyone is welcome to attend
the meeting,

have just as much soul as we
have spiritual life.
No Definite idea of God,

Beer stated that Dr. Leavltt
failed to define his abstract
statements and terms. Rev. Lee-
vitt talked intermittently about
God, but he did not define God.
Everyone who heard the lecture
probably has a ditferent idea of
God, and therefore came away
with a different idea than Dr.
Lavitt intended him to have. As
a result, we get a different idea
from every person, and the real
idea is lost to everyone but Dr.
Leavitt,

Mr. Bear concluded that there
were two advantages and two dis-
advantages of the lectures. First,
the lectures were a good thing be-
cause they showed one of the loo
turerls view of modern things,
Then, too, the speeches were ef-
rective because they made one
think.

The disadvantages were that
Rev. LeaVitt got into a material
world. and that he failed to de—
fine his terms. On the whole, Mr.
Bear said that he disagrced more
than he agreed with the things
said by Leavitt.
