Norris Will

Give Lec’rure

Zoology Head to
Meet Orientation
Class on Tuesday

Harry W. Norris, head of the
department of zoology, for more
than 50 years a member of the
teaching staff of Grinnell, will
meet the freshman class in oz’ienr
tation Tuesday at 11:20 am. in
Herrick chapel to speak on the
history of Grinnell.

All new students are invited to
attend the lecture, if they are free
at that time.

Dr. Norris was graduated from
Grinnell in June of 1536.

He began his college career here
back when Grinnell consisted of
three buildings in the middle of a
prairie and when the men's dormi-
tories were over the lecture rooms.

Growing up in a prairie country,
Norris became interested in ani-
mals and plants at an early age.
When he entered Grinnell in 1597,
he took the regular college course,
which included a term each of
zoology and hotony, and studied
from books with almost no labol‘a»
tory work.

Getting tired of waiting for
class, he started on his own. Most
of his research work evolved from
unfinished work left by students
going on to medical school. It
was in that way that he began
his most important study, that of
the structure of the pituitary body
of the shark.

Dr. Norris celebrated his fiftieth
anniversary at crinnell in May of
1936.

Thin- clad Hop es
Dimmed by Loss
OI: Moriimyer

Pioneer cross country and track
hopos suffered a severe blow this
week when it was announced that
Randall Mortimer, middle distance
runner, would not return to
school.

Mortimer has been forced to
drop his studies for a year and
take employment in the college
bakery

This is the second occasion that
the halfemiler has been cut short
during his track career, as last:
year he was declared ineligible to
the thin clads because of scholase
tic deficiencies.

His loss, particularly to the
two mile relay team, will be
keenly felt, according to G. Lester
Duke, track coach.

Football Men Commence
New Practice Schedule

The football squad has begun a
new practice schedule designed to
remedy the uncertainty experieno
ed in former years by the coaching
staff when it found that labora-
tory and work programs of the
players disrupted the evening
drills.

Dinner for all squadmen will not
be served until 6:30 p. m. in the
men's dining room, while practice
will begin at 4:30 p. m.

tice will begin at 4:30 p. m.
promptly, and the coaching staff
will have no worries about drills
that must be terminated because
of the regular early dinner hour.
6:15 p. m., Guy Lookabaugh, head
football coach, said.
