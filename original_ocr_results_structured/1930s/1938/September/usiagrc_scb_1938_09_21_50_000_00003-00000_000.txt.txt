‘Lovers’ Lane’

Fit to Walk on

By John Marion

Stop worrying, love birds. Those
rough M. de St. L. tracks are no
longer rough (for walking).
During the Summer the rail-
road company was kind enough to
rewinder the tracks which is, “11'
doubtedly, a great improvement
and one that would have long ago
been welcomed.

Now it will be possible to walk
up and back in about half the
time formerly needed.

There is something terribly nn-
l-omantic about stumbling: and a

. improvement,

lot of stumbling has been done on
these tracks But with the new
this will be com-
pletely climiiiatcd. Another fa-
tlie track
in rainy
especially if we suffer
from another spring such as was
had last year.

vorable factor is that
will be much better
weather,
