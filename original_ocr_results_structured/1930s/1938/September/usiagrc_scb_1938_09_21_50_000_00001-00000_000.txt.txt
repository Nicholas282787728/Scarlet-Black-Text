Lookabaugh Builds
Team Around Nine
Returning Veterans

By Edward Wilson

The 1938 edition of the Grinnell
college football team will make
its debut Friday night when it
meets Cornell college on Ward
field.

The game will open the Pion-
eers’ last season in the Missouri
valley conference.

A squad of 34 men reported to
Coach Guy Lookabaugh when
practice began Sept. 10 and has
been working out vigorously since
that time in preparation for the
eight game schedule it faces.

Frequent Scrimmages

Frequent scrimmages and two
intrasquad practice games have
been the order of practice, with
fundamentals coming in for a
share of the drill.

The problem that Lookahaugh
faces is to build a team from the
nine lettermen available. Regular
men from last year‘s squad will
fill all but two of the posts, one
end and one halfback position.

The matter of depth in all pos-
itions is the question that will be
answered as the season progress-
es. While some men look like
prospective understudies for the
regulars, they have been largely
untried.

Begins Third Year

The only veteran end is Capt.
Burke Powers who will begin his
third year at that position.

The likely prospects to fill the
end post and act as substitutes
are Paul Baichly and Ray Cross-

 

Says Departmental
Work Valuable for
Prospective Teachers

Alfred Boylen of New Haven,
Conn, has been appointed assist—
ant in the department of drama
for the coming year. He will act
in the capacity of technical di—
rector, will teach stage lighting
and scene design and will assist
in all technical phases of pros
duction in the Little theater.
Boylen, beginning at the Reus-
salaer Institute of Technology in
Troy, N. Y., continued his study
at the Yale department of drama,
and during the summer of 1936
acted as production manager for
the Lake Placid summer theater.
In the summer or 1937, he was
in charge of stage lighting at
Milford summer theater. During
the past year, he has been in—
structor in stagecratt and teatime

 

 

cian for the University players at
the University of Nebraska.

Boylen stated that be hoped
students at Grinnell had ove
come the ancient prejudice r
garding the amount of technical
work involved in successful pro-
ductions.

The building of sets, making of
costumes, experimentation with
lighting, he said, are basic ne-
cessities not only for students
planning to go into the theater,
but for those expecting to teach.

The field of lighting, be pointed
out, is especially in need of young
men interested in, and qualified
for, work in electrical engineering.
