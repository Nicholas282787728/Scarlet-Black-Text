GUR MISTAKE

it has collie to our attention that we
have shared a common misapprehension in
our news and editorial columns as to the
status of the college band in relation to the
athletic department.

The fact of the matter, as brought to
the attention of the Student Council recentv
ly, is that the band has, for the past several
years, been neither under the supervision of
the athletic department nor of the music
department.

The idea that the band was directly, or
indirectly, associated with the athletic dc—
partmcnt no doubt has come down from the
fact that physical education credit is now
given to those members participating in the
band

Even though we are grateful to the
department of physical education for aiding
the band in this way during the past few
years, we retain our conviction that one
hour‘s credit toward ~aduation should be
substituted, in line with the present recom-
mendations for band reorganization by the
Student Counc

We are still of the opinion that the
hand is not operating at any great effi-
ciency under the present set up, and we
await with interest the conclusion to be
reached by the faculty committee on stu-
dent organizations and publications regard
ing the recommendations for band reorgani»
zation handed down by the Student Councili

G—
PEi-ili timid HELL

/ 5 far as students are concerned,
pcnn' 3 are used to play games of ”Penny
Auto,” .id to pay the ever present sales
tax. ’

When the Macy house boys accumulated
approximately 40,000 of them in a few
hours, and “cornered” the Grinncll supply,
it created enough news to reach the front
pages and cause comment in five or six
ncws broadcasts.

It is difficult to estimate the number

GRINI‘IELL SCARLET AND BLACK

of pennies paid in sales taxes every year in
this country, but they are probably for in
excess of 10 billion, The importance of the
matter rests not in the fact that they are
pennies, not even in the fact that the total
amount is very large, fol large taxes are
necessary, but in the fact that tlicse pennies
2 e paid in sales taxes Sales taxes are “re-
_ 'eSsive" taxes, because they are levied
upon articles of wide general consumption,
which call 101' a greater share of the poor
man's expenditure than the rich man‘s.
This automatically decreases effective pur—
chasing pow r in a business system already
suffering il'om insufficient purchasing
pouer.

Because they are poor men’s taxes, be—
cause they reduce effective purchasing
power, because they intelisifyuailtl prolong
depressions, they are Pennies from Hell. and
the students showed commendable interest
in staging their dramatic protest against
such taxes

LET'S HAVE SOME MORE

According to all reports, the party for
town men and town women held in the
White house Sunday was definitely a ”good
function,” -

Such parties are fine justification of
the purposes for which the White house
was organized. Not only that, they speak
well for the organizations of the students
living in town. There is a great advantage
to the school as a whole in having such
unity among the town groups.

Much credit for the party Sunday must
go to Joe Woodward and to the women who
did so much to 1112 'e the party a success

NEEDS A REMEDY

Since it is the policy of the campus
Christian organizations, the Student Council,
and many faculty members to promote the
development of co-educational athletics, it
would seem that the situation in regard to
tennis should be remedied.

There are at present on this campus
only four tennis courts which are fit to
use. Even these, the ones near the quad-
innglc, would not be in shape today with-
out the Voluntary services of the Varsity
tennis men who have spent considerable
time getting the courts in shape.

Under the present system of regu
tions on these courts, however, the tennis
team will not have the use of these courts
for practice except at the will of tlic wo-
men.

The soecallcd men’s courts are almost
unuscablc because of the high prevailing
wind therei

Hence, it seems that steps should be
taken to work out a solution to this prob-
lem. Both from the point of View of the
tennis team and from the point of view of
promoting co-cducational athletics, some
thing should be done,

AtTiVE-hm‘ PASSiGVEUPPOhT

This year has seen the largest turnout
for the golf team in the history of Gl'innell.
This is obvious evidence that golf docs
attract the interest of the strident body, at
least part of it. However, the largest part
of the campus continues to show only a
passive interest in the sport. Year after
year, the matches remain only a round of
18 holes and an interesting conversation
with some follow from another school.

Galleries should be an essential part of
every good golf match. More active support
of the golf team would not only add interest
in the matches themselves, but would stim»
ulatc the players to better efforts, Nor
would there be any need for apologizing to
the spectators. There is some topenotch golf
being played here every year, Last year,
such p , )l'S as Billy Hall, state amateur
runnc up, and former state junior cham-
pion, and Joe Von Mnur, state amateur
champion from Dnvcupol , played here.
Hall will be back this year, with the Iowa
State team, along with other fine golfers.

Student suppolt of the coming varsity
golf meets will do much to further the
status of golf on the campus. '
