How Do You Act
At Breakfast?
Few Can Tell

How many are actually wide
enough awake to notice their
actions at the breakfast table?

Each morning the head
waiter in the men's dining
room observes the ‘Steepyeeycd
student entering at the last
gong and walking shakily up
to the indicated tahle where
only one vacant seat remains7
at the water or cocoa pitcher.

He hesitates a moment; then
sits down, and begins digging
mechanically into his orange or
grapefruit,

Silence.

“Pass the cereal,

No response.

“A little cereal, please."

A man across the table
looks up and passes the butter.

From over the man's shoulr
der comes, “How many hots?”

No answer.

“Hots?” ,

Still no answer, The cream
starts around, and each man
eyes it savagely.

"How many want coffee?"

A few fingers go up,

Silence.

The toast starts around. No
butter.

Four men wait for cream,
and three men wait for butter,

All seven are staring at the
sugar how],

one by one, each of the men
excuse themselves and leave
the table. How many words
are spoken? About 16!

Thinclads

Prepare ‘For
Drake Relays

Duke Enters All
Except Relay Men
In College Division

By Clark Smith

The first contingent of a squad
of 13 Pioneer thinclads will leave
for Des Moines to compete in the
Drake relays Friday.

For the first time since 1918,
the relay teams, with the excep—
tion of the shuttle hurdle team,
will be competing in the college
division instead of the university
section. Coach 0. Lester Duke
said he feels that this change will
be permanent unless a team of
unusual ahility should develop
that would be capable of showing
tavorably in the powerful compe-
tition of the university section.

The only time Grinnell won a
relay event in the university class
was in 1933 when the four mile
team was victorious, but victories
were numerous before 1919 when
it was in the college division.
With this change, it is expected
that the Pioneers will have more
favorable results when competing
in their own class,

The strongest combinations pose
sible have been put together to
run as a team for this week.
However, the squad is eyeing the
Beloit relays May 6 as their real
objective for a showing in team
strength. Those men who are
not competing in Des Moines this
weekend are holding trials for the
right to make the trip to Beloit.

In the Iowa State Teachers
college relays Saturday, the squad
showed general all around im-
provement that was most encour-
aging to Coach Duke. The men

Class Unanimously
Favors Attempt
Next Spring

Possibilities for the return of a
student annual, to appear in the
spring ot 1939. were seen Mon-
day night when 50 members of
the sophomore class met in the
,Alumni Recitation hall and dis—
cussed the chances for such a
publication by the class next
year.

Ballots with three statements
concerning sophomore interest in
the publication were passed out
at the meeting. Each statement
received a unanimous vote in fa-
vor of an annual.

Ability and Ambition

Helen Kolyn, president of the
class, in speaking to the group,
said that the class had the ability
andamhition as well as the co—
operation of the college adminis<
tration to put out such an annual.

In an open discussion of the
group, the members of the class
discussed means of financing the
publication, size and content of
such an annual, and other mate
ters concerning it,

Plans Are Tentative

"All plans and ideas for such
a publication are merely tenta—
tive and we have no reason to
believe that we shall definitely
publish an annual next year,"
Miss Kolyn said,

If such a year book should he
published, it would be put out by
next year’s junior class next
spring and would honor the se<
nior class, she said.
