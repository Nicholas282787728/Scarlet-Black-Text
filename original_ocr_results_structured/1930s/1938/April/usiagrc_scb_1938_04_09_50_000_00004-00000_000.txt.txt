Pioneers Face
Week of Tough
Drill Sessions

 

Snow and cold weather has
forced a curtailment of the activ-
ities of the Pioneer track squad,
and the inter-squad dual meet
planned for this afternoon has
been postponed, according to G,
Lester Duke, track coach,

As a result of the impossibili-
ty to work outdoors, the recondi-
tioning process of the squad is
going at a slow pace, he said.

Coach Duke has had his charges
taking light workouts on the
men’s gymnasium track to pre—
vent shin splints and other all—
ments from the hard indoor track.
The work has been mainly con—
fined to jogging and easy starts.

A hard week of work is in
store for the thin clads beginning
next Monday, provided there is a
break in the weather, Duke stated.
The Coe meet is only a week

away and considerable training
and conditioning is needed, he
concluded.

Track Repairs

Drainage Attempted
During Vacation;
Surface Leveled

 

Bad weather has caused a de-
lay in the completion of resup
facing the running track, G. Les-

ter Duke, varsity track coach,
said today.
.An attempt to remove the

puddles from the east side of the
track was made during vacation,
and according. to Duke, the top
dressing of cinders has made the
track level in all places.

Original plans called for the
track to be rolled all this week,
Duke said. An investigation is
now being carried on to ﬁnd the
price of redoing the whole track
and changing it into a quarter-
mile oval instead of the present
onert'hlrd of‘ a mile distance.

Earlier plans were made to
have the track resurfaced last
fall but the ground froze before
the project got under way.
