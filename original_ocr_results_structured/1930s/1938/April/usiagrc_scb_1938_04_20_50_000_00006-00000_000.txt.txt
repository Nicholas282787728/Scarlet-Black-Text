Duke Drives
Track Team
In Prac‘lice

First Performance
Fails to Impress

Track Mentor

By Clark Smith
.After a disappointing perform-
ance against Coe last Saturday,
Coach G. Lester Duke is hearing
down on his trachmen as they pre-
pare for the Iowa State Teachers
college relays to be held at Cedar
Falls this Saturday. Duke feels
that 'several of the men were not
in good shape for the .Coe meet
and need extra work.
Particularly disappointing was
the performance of the mile relay
team and because of their exhibi—
tion. emphasis and strength will
be spread to the other relay
teams. This means that Schlot-
terbeck will probably run on the
sprint medley team along with
stryker, Seeger
There is a possibility that this

combination might break the meet‘

record Saturday if conditions are
ideal.

l Problem

The half mile relay team re—
mains a problem, as a quartet of
runners must be chosen from
Keating. stryker, Cranny, Hagan
or Appelquist. The personnel of
the two mile team remains the
same as Mortimer, Pedersen, Sear
ger and Schlotterbeck round into
better shape so that Duke hopes
to have them running their event
in eight minutes in another two
weeks.

The squad of 21 men that
leaves Saturday morning will not
be at full strength because Co-
captain John Hayward has suf-
fered a recurrence of a back ine
jury, This will present him from
defending his championship in the
high hurdles, for which he also
holds the meet record. If Hay-
ward’s back is sufficientlyhealed,
he will compete in the shot put,
discus and javelin. while Baichly
and Pfohl will compete in the

and Powers. ‘
