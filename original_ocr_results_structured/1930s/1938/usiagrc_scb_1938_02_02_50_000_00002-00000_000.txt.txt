Tulsa Repeai's
in 32-30 Win

Pioneers Break Loose in
Last 5 Minutes of Fast
Game with Long Shots

Repeating on their home ﬂoor
what they succeeded in doing
here two weeks ago, Tulsa cagers
last night defeated the Pioneers
32-30 in a game that was wild
and wooly all the way.

The Pioneers were unable to hit
their stride until the last five
minutes when they round the hoop
with long shots to break up what
had been an 11 point lead and
climb to within one point of the
Tulsans.

Tulsa's captain, Bobby Jones,
pulled the game out of the fire
in the last half minute of play
with a counter from the sidelines
and a gift shot on a foul by con-
will.

CAGERS TRIP \VASHBURN
IN'SOUTHERN OPENER

The Pioneer basketball team
opened their threeegame invasion
of the southland Saturday with
a 35734 victory over Washburn at
Topeka, Kan, to run their victory
string in the conference to four
wins against two losses.

The game was one of those
story-book affairs all the way,
with neither tcam holding a de
cisive advantage at any point un-
til, with around a minute or so
to play, washhurn pulled away to
a fourrpomt load. Fred Luther,
who led all the scoring done for
the evening, suddenly contributed
two haskcts to the Pioneer cause,
while Berry came through with
another.

The best Washburn could do
was one free throw, although
Mackey, Washburn forward, miSSr
ed two gift tosses with 24 seconds
of the game remaining.
