Thursday
Robert M. Norton, instructor in
history, spoke on the need of the
modern world for an orientation in
its present confused situation. ”Few.
of us as individuals have any idea
of what it's all about," he said. “We
are told to be opthni tie and all \vill‘
be well; we are advised on the other
hand. to get ready for the worst.

“The tragedy of it is that, in lieu
of anything better, most of this ad-
vice is being followed, and we are
trying to go in many different di~
rections at the same time."

In speaking of the effect of this'
world-wide confusion on present day
college students, he added, “AS the
world ch‘anges about us, we must ad-
just ourselves to it. This is a more
serious problem to us than to our
elders. We cannot afford a philoso-
phical calm, and cannot take shelter
in a conviction of futility. We must
face the situation squarely. The world
needs first of all sound thinking and
practical learning. The new social
philosophy is a challenge and a ne-
cessity to the students of this gen-
eration far more than to our elders."

Friday

J. “7. Charlton, associate professor
of economics, discussed, "Optimistic
Reﬂections on the Business Depress-
inn.” He pointed out that the modern
world is undergoing a reaction from
the gross materialism of the last de-
cade and that religious forces are re—
asserting themselves.

“Family ties are being strengthen—
ed despite the terrific strain from re—
duced incomes and people are com-
ing to a greater realization of their
need for others. Many favorite old
prepossessions and illusions are be»
ing exploded, notably tbe’tdriff and
the myth of ‘Rugged Individualism}
It seems safe to say that the tariff
has lost its magic to a large extent
in America.”

Professor Charlton also pointed
out that the recent operations of the
Reconstruction Finance corporation
snow striking tendencies toward
socialism and government control of
railroads, “AS never before," he con—
cluded, “The people are taking an
interest in the solution of social and
economic problems."
