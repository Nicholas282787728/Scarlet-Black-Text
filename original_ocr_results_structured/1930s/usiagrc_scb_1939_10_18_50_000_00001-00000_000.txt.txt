'Will Take 25
To Colorado

Pioneers. to Leave
Friday for Battle
With Tiger Team

’Twentyrf‘lve members of the
Grinnell squad will leave Friday
evening for Colorado Springs,
Colo, where they will play Colo<
rado college Saturday afternoon.

The Pioneers will be seeking
their second consecutive victory
over the Tigers. Last year at
Crinnell the locals triumphed 21
to 7 in the first game between
the two schools.

Crinnoll to Be stronger.

Coach Guy Lookabaugh stated
-that crinnell will send a strong-
er team against Colorado than
the one which defeated Simpson
here last Saturday. 7 to a. The
added strength comes from the
return of Jerry Grant and Rob-
lert, Hamann. both of whom were
out of the Simpson game because
of injured legs.

The season’s records of Grin-
nell and Colorado show that
Grinneli has won twice and lost
twice, while Colorado has won
one game and lost two. Colorado
was defeated last week 22 to 6
by Washburn, strong ,Missouri
Valley conference contender.
Simpson Game Untmprossive

1n commenting on the Pioneers’
somewhat unimpressive showing
against Simpson, Lookabaugh
said that the team's passing was
superior to any other perform-
ance thisI year. Harry Barker,
fullback, passed the ballaccurate-
ly, although only four passes out
of twenty-three were completed:
The low percentage of completed
passes was due to the fact that
the receivers missed a number
of easy trys. In fact, touchdowns
would have been made twice had‘
the ends held on to the ball.

Being Planned

Initial Venture Will
Be Held Friday in
Rand Gymnasium

ture of other afternoon dances,"

through the campus, sheepskin
coats bobbed and ducked on the

for its thirty-fourth sack of
popcorn and rewound the blanket.
Up in the press box coffee and
sandwiches instead of the usual
doughnuts were served, and two
rows below Dooley leaned back
in luxury on somebody else’s
knees (Dooley being no contor-
tionist) and chanted to the
strains of his dainty portable.
The ball was on the two-yard
line. Milam shouted again and

Cleveland Press
Reviews Recital
By Huffman

“Institute's newest recruit to fa-
culty charms in recital” was the
headline appearing in the Cleve
land Plain Dealer on a review of
a recital given by F. Walter'Huff—
man, instructor in voice at Grin-
nell college last year.

Commenting further on the pro-
gram given by Huffman, now a

faculty member of the Cleveland
Institute of Music, in the bau-

room of that institution, the critic
declared, "He is both a lyric tenor
and sensitive artist, capable of
projecting the full import of a
song in accurate detail as well
as in the broad sweep of its larg-
er contours.

"His voice has a gently allur-
ing. fine, even texture. as agree-
able as his unassuming personal»
lty."

The Cleveland Press, in review—
ing the recital. declared, "Mr.
Huffman's musical sensitiveness
and interpretative intelligence
were in evidence in all that he
performed."

Said the Cleveland News. “Huff-
man not only char-med his hearers
with his personality, but evinced
a fine musicianly understanding of
the vocal art."

included in Huffman’s program
were several old Italian arias, a
group of Sibelius songs, and
French, German, and English
pieces.

he was the only one who cared.

The ball was on the forty—five
yard line, Crinnell was coming

up for a second down and five'

yards to go. The band tore into
"Pioneers". The Pep club stood up
and the rest of the stadium, per<
force to see so as not to change
its focus, did likewise.

The ball was snapped, and the‘

teams charged. Three scouts
from Cornell and Coe gaped wlde-

them gasped. "Who made what?"
gasped the other two. "Grinnell
made it," he responded breath—
