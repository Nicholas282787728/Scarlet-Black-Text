Sports Board
Changes Rules
of Intramurals

New Eligibility Provision
Presented for Student

Consideration

Changes in intramural eligibility
rules, as contained in Article 1 of the
by-laws, have been proposed, accord-
ing to G. L. Duke, intramural direcc
tor, in order that there will be great-
er flexibility between intramural and
varsity sports.

The proposed changes will be cone
sidered by the intramural board Tues-
day evening and will be adopted if
there is no serious student objection.
They will go into effect next semeSA
ter.

Allow for “Second String’ ,

Members of the intramural board
are John Shephard, Smith hall; Vine
cent Saurino, Langan; Arnold Dicks
inson, Rawson; Harold Anderson,
Gates; George Reed, Clark, and
Thomas Cordon, Dibble.

Changes will allow members of
varsity squads who are not “regu—
lars" to compete on an intramural
team in another sport, They will also
provide for a freshman squad list to‘
be made out by freshman coaches, so
that an individual of known I‘l‘es
man caliber, may not indulge in in-
tramural competition during the sea—
son of the sp in question.

Sec ons Deleted

Sections 3 and 4 from Article I are
to bertleleterl from the byalatvs..They
are:

3. “No individual who has been a
member of a varsity squad at the.
time of a regularly scheduled varsity
game, or who has ever competed as
a member of a varsity or freshmen
varsity squad, shall play on an in-
tramural team during the scason in
question.”

List’ to the Saga
of the Ring and
The Stag-a!

While strolling through
one day,

McMurray held a stag at bay.

”You saved me," said the king,

“AS a token, here's my ring"7

In the merry, merry month of May.

c

Some of the above details may not
be historically true, but John Mc~
Murray, Kelly Stables sophomore,
admits that there is at least a tree
ditional significance in the fact that
he wears a gold ring with the seal
of a Stdg’s head and the motto,
“Virtute, fideque.”

John doesn't claim to have persons
ally saved the king's life. “It was my
great, grcat, great, great grandfath-
er," he explains.

No one knows whether the incident
happened in May, but it is fairly cer»
tain that the ancestral McMurray,
an Irish nobleman, was not strolling
through the park, but was riding on
a hunting party with the English
king, The king was thrown from his
horse at the fcet of an enraged stag,
and only the quick work of McMur-
ray in killing the animal saved the
king’s life.

Nor is it certain that
gave McMui-ray a ring: the family
legend mentions only the right to
use the stag scal. Thcrc arc several
other rings with the stag seal in thc
McMurray family.

After trounciug Drake by a 36-25
score last night in Des Moines,
Creighton will invade the Grinnell
campus this evening in an attempt
to topple the Pioneers from the top
of the conference heap. The game
will begin at 7:30 p. m.

Grinncll will be considerably han-
dicapped in that Phelps and Bauer,
ltwo of the outstanding Pioneercen-
ter candidates, are both suffering
from leg injuries. '

Spraius Ankle

A sprained ankle suffered Wednes-
day will likely kccp Bauer on the
sidelines, while Phelps is still bother-
ed by a leg infection which resulted
from a bruise received in the Central
game. Morgan will probably start
at the pivot position, J. (3. True:—
dele, varsity coach, announced yes—
terday, while Oliphant may see some
service at that post.

Crcighton has presented a power-
ful'offcnse‘in its games thus far,
and is co-favorite, with Butler, to
win the Valley title. In four pro»
season games, the Blucjays averaged
49 points against 24 for its oppon-
ents.

Good Defense

on defense, the Pioneers have es—
tablished as good a record in their
first five contests, allowing the op-
posing teams but 26 points on the
average, but have rung up only 30
points per game themselves.

While the Grinnellians nosed out
Washington as to 29 last Saturday,
their first conference tilt, the play
of both outfits was ragged, accord-
ing to Coach Tiucsdale. Led by En-
glebretson, high-scoring forward,
and Schmidt, six foot eighteinch
center, the Omaha five presents an
offensive combination which will be
difficult for the Pioneers to step un-
less the past week's work has
smoothed up their defensive play.

Bluejays Make
New Year’s Resolves

(Special in Tlrc Scarlet and Block)

Omaha, Nebr.—Creighton univer-
‘slty's formidable Bluejay basketeers,.
who make New Year's resolutions as
hopefully as anyone, came to Iowa
with two important ones to keep
during the weekend while invading
the Drake and Gn‘nnell strongholds
for important Missouri Valley eons
ference games.

The first was that Drake, tem-
porary leadcrs of the conference by
virtue of a double win over the Okla-
homa Aggies, was topplcd from the
lead when the Bluejays met them in
the Drake field house in Des Moines,
This was accomplished last night
when Drake was downed so to 25.

And the second is that Cl'elghton's
unspottcd record against Criuncll,
which shows 11 victories without a
defeat, will remain unspottcd after
the Bluejay-Pionccr game at Grin—
ncll tonight,

Schnbiugcr Worries

In spitc of Ci‘eightoll‘s fine prc-
season record, which lists four Vice
tories in as many starts against
South Dakota, North Dakota and
Missouri universities as well as Kan-
sas State, Coach A, A. Scllabinger is
not ovcrconfidcnt.

Howevcr, further brilliant play last
Saturday against North Dakota by
Englcbretson and Lomax, sophomore
forwards, has proven heartening to
Blucjay fans, and the excellent pet-
formances turned in all season by the
other three members of Creigllton's
