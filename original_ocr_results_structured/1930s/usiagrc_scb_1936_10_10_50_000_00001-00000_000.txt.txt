Do You Close Your Eyes When Kissing?
Survey Reveals Some Do, Some Don’t

 

 

By Francis Hansen. 'i

“Why do you close your eycsl
when you get kissed?” Appal'r
ently there are almost as many
answers to that question as there.

~ are students on Grinnell campu~ l

The first reaction was gene?“
ally, “Gosh, I don‘t know, I just
do.” On second thought, the an-l
swcrs were typical of the people,
Two psychology majors went into
a long explanation of how gazing,
into each other‘s eyes dwided the‘
attention and dctracted from that,
perfect thrill of a kiss. l

Quite the opposite theory was;
that "It makes you look cl-css—'
eyed." A brunette junior girl
blushed (actually) when she was
asked and said, ”It’s so embarl‘as-i
sing!"

A few students got into quite
an argument about it over theiri
cokes arid cigarettes. One schooll
of thought proposed various theo-

 

I someone else that

ries on eyerclosing, the others ins
sisted just as violently that it
was better
A senior girl who should know,
said, “I close them instinctively
but open them right away to see
if anybody’s coming."
SS'B Men Differ,

Two men-about-theSkB-ofﬁcc
differed widely in their views.
One said, “It‘s more restful and
contented-like that way.
hitting the pillow when I go to
bed at night.” The other looked
puzzled: “1 don't know whether 1
do or not. 1 never pay any ab
tention," he declared.

The Habit or Instinct group
was large, many of them insist-
ing that they hadn’t any idea
why they closed their eyes. ex-
t-cpt that they couldn't help it.
one Junior thought that it was
more romantic that way, and
it has more

to keep them open.

Like

harmony and aesthetic value.
It’s Like Rhythm.

One of the prize answers was
that of the thoughtful hlonde
sophomore at the dinner table.
“Well, you close your eyes when
you're dancing, to get the rhythm.
and everything, soiundel‘stand?”

A few flippant souls made
cracks like “It’s usually dark,
nnywny," or “1 can imagine it's
Robert Taylor instead of the
current boy-friend." One man de-
clared that his girl looked all out
of focus through his glasses. He
seemed surprised when the aud»
ience choriised, “Why don't you
take them off?"

It may‘ not mean anything, but
the only answer missing seems
to have been, "I don’t know, I've
never been kissed.” Maybe we
should have asked a few more
freshmen instead of so many up-

perclassmcn.

Omaha, Nebr. (Special to the
Scarlet and Blackl—A fighting
Pioneer team held a powerful
Creighton Bluejay team to a
scoreless tie in the first half, but
trailed are at the end of the third
quarter, when William Ziesel, elu-
sive Jay half, wriggled through
a hole through his own left tack-
le, and eluding the Grinnell sec—
ondary, ran 73 years for a touch-
down. Creighton failed to con-
vert.

Grinnell thredtpned the Jays
when the Pioneers recovered a
Creighton fumble on the Jay 35-
yard line, but the drive was halt-
ed by a series of Grinnell funi-
bles by Sampson and Barker, and
Grinnell was forced to kick. The
Pioneers threatened again in die
first quarter when they had pos-
session of the ball on the Blucjay
39-yard line.

The Bluejays threatened early
in the first quarter only to lose
the ball on downs on the Grinnell
20—yard line, but during the re-
mainder of the first half were
not in scoring territory.

An incomplete account of the
first half follows. Grinnell won
