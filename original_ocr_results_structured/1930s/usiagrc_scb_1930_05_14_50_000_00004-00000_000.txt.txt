The high school athletes from Ma-
son City proved their all~around
superiority when they piled up 33 1-
2 points to Win first honors in the
Twenty-third Annual Grinnell Col-
lege lnterscholastic Track and Field
meet on Ward field Saturday after-
noon.

Davenport was in second place
With 26 1-6 points While Newton,
who had been picked to Come In
first, was third with 25. Washing-
ton high of Cedar Rapids, who won
the meet last year, failed to present
any opposition and could garner on—
ly 3 1-2 points.

Gillmol-e Halland of Northwood
was the outstanding performer of
the day. He won first places in the
century and 220-yard dashes and 8.1.
so in the broad-jump. The fifteen
points which he earned were suffic-
ient to put his team in fifth place.
Mason Oty’s victory came mainly
as a result of the efforts of three
men, Kenney, who took first places
in both hurdle events, Kohl, who Won
the half-mile in easy style, and
Moore, who placed in both the dash
events.

Only one record was hroken, the
half—mile relay, when Daven—
port ran their section in 1:341, clip-
ping seven»tenths of a second off the
old record held by Washington high
of Cedar Rapids.
