THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

WEDNESDAY MARCH 22' 1935

 

By Jack Kelsey

Although the Grinnell track team
placed third in the recent indoor
ouadranglar meet at Iowa City, there
are several points in regard to the
results that are quite noteworthy.
The meet was quite close between
Iowa, Drake and Grinnell. in fact so
close that one of the teams might
have changed places with only a lit-
tle difference in the finishes.

Even though Clarence ‘m‘rogxl
"Snap," “Pres" (others not to be
mentioned) James has had oiuy one
night of practice since the Drake
indoor meet, he placed second in the
broad jump with a leap or 22 feet
1-3 inches, an inch less than Schiicc-
man of Drake, who won the 8\ out.
Not only that, but on one occasion
the Frogger hurled himself through
the air for a leap of over 23 feet,
only to have some belittling referee
notify him that his elbow touched
the pit exactly a foot behind the
cavity made by his feet Heigh ho!

‘GA

1n the one mile race, wnich the
Grinnell team took in easy fashion,
the first four men to finish were
timed in less” than 4 minutes and 25
seconds, which is considered quite
good for the long drag, Three of
these were Grinnell men. and by in-
cluding the other Grinnell man‘s time
with these, it is found that about four
seconds could have been clipped from
the Drake relay record, had the men
been running the four mile relay. Ac-
cording to those who know. Grinnell
not only has one of the finest mile
teams ever, but it will also be among
the first placers in the larger meets
which will be held after spring vaca-
tion. Grinnell scored points in every
event of the meet with the exception
of the half mile run, while the Uni-
versity of Iowa thinclads were shut
out in five events. The next meet on
the schedule for the Pioneers will be
the Kansas relays.

Even though the epidemic is
checked, illness has again interrup-
ted the intramural sports program,
for the championship water-polo
game between Smith and Dibble
scheduled for Monday night was
called off due to sickness on the
part of members of both squads.
Although it has not been definitely
announced, the meet will probably
he postponed until after the spring
holidays.

coach Juhn c, Truesdale announc-
ed yesterday that spring basketball
would start this week and that all
those who aspired for positions on
the team next season will be expected
to report for the practice. The athr
letic council will meet this afternoon
to determine the lettermcn for the
season and these men, in addition to
several capable underclassmen will
form the nucleus for the quintet.
