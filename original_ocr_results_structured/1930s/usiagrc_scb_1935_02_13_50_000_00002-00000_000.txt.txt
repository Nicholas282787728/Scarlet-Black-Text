COACH JUGGLING.

With the rumblings of the athletic shake-up
at Oklahoma A, and M. which left the Aggics
without an athletic director and with a new
basketb ll coach hardly died away, it is reported
that C) ighton is now threatening to juggle its
coaching staff As a school which has been going
through a very unpleasant athletic depression, we
at Grinnell cannot see that the Omaha school has
any basis for all its worry just because no Valley
championships have been forthcoming this year.
Perhaps there is.more behind the dissatisfaction
than appears on the surface, but if not it seems
that the school officials are Exhibiting undue im—
patience.

It is rumored that even A. A. Schabinger,
athletic director and basketball coach who has
met with such signal success as a mentor at the
Omaha institution, may go. This, of course, may
not be true. It is most illogical that any school
should oust a man whose teams have won or
shared in three cage championships in the six
years of his regime.

This business of ousting coaches at the least
provocation is fast becoming a game—and a
mighty unpleasant one for the coaches who are
being made pawns in the hands of dis
satisfied alumni, to hire or fire as they see
fit. These busy-body alumni never' take into
consideration the kind of material a coach has
available. _It’s a matter of “deliver the goods, or

else ”

The situation here during recent years has
been one which would have incited feverish ac»
tivity among the “loyal sons” of most colleges,
though the Grinnell athletic depression was mani»
festly the result of a dearth of material.

Accepting the situation as unfortunate but
inevitable under the circumstances, the college
officials and alumni have “sat tight,” and it ap—
pears that the difficulty is working itself out.
After a number of lean years on the basketball
court, Grinncll is now enjoying its most suc-
cessful season in nearly two decades; and after
two of the most disasterous years in its long
football history, next fall promises an appreci—
able advance on the road back to grid glory.
And not a single coach has been sacrificed in the

process,

The recent r .
mun colleges tlll'ougnolll lbc Collnir'
(llczltlon of the >1 l tillllca '
iield of collegiate .hlcrics

of coaches in
is an in»

was exposed a low

years back by the Carnegie investigation of tllc
subsidization of athletes. Undoubtedly in a por-
tion of the cases their has been real justification
for the changes sought in the coaching personnel,
but in a large majority of them the real motivat-
ing force has been simply the urge to “win at
any cost."

AN OBSOLETE TREATY.

That anachronism, the Treaty of Versailles,
which ended the “war to end wars" but instead
has proved to be notlling_more than a constant
threat to the peace of the world, may soon receive
its deathvblow, according to recent European dis-
patches.

Germany, in countering the Anglo-French
proposal on armaments, will quite likely try to
turn the affair into a “knock-out” blow for the
entire settlement arranged in 1919. If this comes
to pass, one of the greatest war threats in Euro-
pcan politics will have been obliterated, and the
peace of the world will be more secure than it
has been at any time Since the signing of the
treaty.

Among the most outstanding of the injustices
which Germany seeks to have righted are the
boundary changes which will rejoin Memcl and
Danzig to the Fatherlandiand the re-armament oi
Germany on an equal basis with the other nations.
Any one of these points is tinder for another
world—wide Conflagration, and the revision of
the Treaty of Versailles would check this danger.
The peace of the world would be further strength»
encd since, as a price for this rczld)ustment, Ge
many would be forced to rejoin the League
Nations making that body more effective.

Why the Treaty of Versailles has not been
radically revised is an unsolved question, although
the explanation undoubtedly lies in the Euro«
pean politics of the past decade. Nevertheless.
it is plain that the treaty has been slowly weather—
ing away. The reparation clauses of that docu»
ment are already in abeyauce, and the recent
Anglo-French proposal recognizes the futility or
trying to keep Germany from re-arming.

The next step is the abolishment of the en-
tire treaty, thus clearing the way for a satisfactory
scttlcment of Europe’s jumbled affairs. In face
of this steady dissolution of the treaty, revision
should be instigated to make it operative with
justice to all the nations concerned, thereby ens
hancing the future peace of the world.

NO SECURITY WITHOUT DISARMAMENT

In the recent discussions between French and
English statesmen at London over a new plan of
peace for Europe, disarmament occupied a very
negligible position. The plan proposes three
security pacts and provides for Germany’s re»
entering the League of Nations, but there is no
promise of disarmament. There was only a
vague mention of an “arrangement“ of armaments
in the event that Germany accepts the plan and
is permitted to re-arm, by striking out the arma-
ment provisions of the Versailles treaty.

If the Anglo—French plan is acceptable to
Germany, she will have the right to increase her
armaments enormously, probably to a higher
level than she has reached under illegal arming.

If Germany regards armament equality as an
end in iself, as the settlement of a question of
dignity, it would be quite possible that disarma-
ment may follow. But if she accepts equality
as a means to other ends such as an attempt at
expansion or conquest, as many fear, disarma»
ment negotiations would obviously be futile. In
the light of this possibility, one mi ht ask how
this security plan, without any prov ion for dis—
armament, can secure peace.

This plan might be compared to a commune
ity's telling a burglar that he will be allowed tr
keep his pass keys and guns provided he prom'.
not to use them against possible prey. Such a
situation would hardly bring the parties to tru
each other, nor would it be likely to insure secur»
ity.

Unless statesmen have definitely given up
hope of disarmament, it would seem that here
would he an excellent opportunity to reach an‘
agreement concerning a reduction invarmamcnts.
Otherwise it seems probable that the new secur—
ity pacts will merely be a new version of the old
story that has precipitated European were. in the
past.

lnents, Miss Johnson, who is a grad.

that is in every way so ﬁnished a

of the family’s llfc oil the farm and
particularly the last year when
drought, debt, and a premonition of

too much to bear,

This is a farm. novel of more than
ordinary power and truth. It is a
story of delicate and devious human
emotions told in a prose so bcauti.
fully cadenccd with an undertone of
tragic iceiing that it is like protoundly
moving music. This certainly is the
best or the recent deluge oi farm
novels and \vcll worth reading.

it is needless to urge you to read a

In closing he pointed out the grave
question of whether or not Protestant.

characteristic features of our times.
This question Dr. Holmes will discuss

Holmes Cites

Causes of Depression

Describing the. present economic de.
pression as one of thc three great
crises of history, Dr. John Haynes
,Hulmes analyzed the causes of thc
world’s condition in his second Gates
Memorial lecture on “The Collapse of
Capitalism” in Herrick chapel last
lnight.

Thc fall of Rome, which led to the
Dark Ages, and the breakdown of
feudalism, followed by the Renaissance
and the Reformation, were character.
ized as the first two crises. Either
another dark age or another 1'?“
ante may follow this third crisis. in
the opinion of the lecturer.

\‘elopmcnts, the speaker asserted,

SL’Jtlng that the capitalis‘ic systclu
exists for proiit rather than ior pro.
viding food, clothing and shelter, Dr.
Holmes pointed out three forms which
are working to destroy it. They are
the abundance of goods, causing luuer
prices which destroy profits, the in.
ability of the system to distribute
goods, and the lack of cooperation in
industry.

Capitalism cannot overcolnc these
forces, it was said, because poverty
increases as industrial cfficlency creat.
es more and more permanent unem.
ploymcnt. Stating that he was un.
certain as to what form the new order
would take, the speaker expressed the
belief that the change would be a
gradual transition rather than a vio.
lent upheaval, ,

“Idea of Future
Changed”—~Holmes

stressing the change in the attitude
of mankind towards the future oi the
world, Dr. John Haynes Holmes of
the Community church of New York
City yesterday morning in Her.
rich chapel, pointed out that
no longer does man believe that
progress is inevitable, but instead talks
about the return of the Dark Ages.
His topic, “The EndofanEra,” was
was ”The End of an Era" which was
designed to serve as an introduction
to the lectures which were to follow.

Terming the World War as the de.
bacle which marked the downfall ot
capitalistic society, he pointed out
ihat during this era of decline the
world had produced four great men
who had contributed materially to
upsetting the preconceived and spine.
ing notions of the Victorian era. The
men he named were Albert Einstein,
Sigmund Freud, Nickoli Lenin, and
Mahatma Ghandi,

Each of these figures has eontrib.
uted to the downfall of the existing,
order, Dr. Holmes declared. Einstein
has upset scientific theories as no man
has done since Newton, while Freud
penetrated into the substance of the
mind and coniounded mankind with
his discoveries.

Termjng Lenin a charateer with a
“colossal mind," he stated that die Red
leader was a symbol of the collapse of
capitalism. The futility of human
taith which has tolerated destructive
materialism and militarism is illus.
trated hy the character oi Ghandi, Mr
Holmes pointed out.

“These four men have swept away
the entire world," he declared. There
are two reactions which the human
race may make to this decline, the
speaker declared. One is the (atolls.
tic attitude of hopeless resignation such
as has been adopted by Spengler in
his book the “Decline of Western Civil.
zation"; the other is to attempt to
meet the forces of our doom and on.
cleaver to wrest from them their sec.
rats which in the end will save our
world.

"Why should we be afraid in an
age which has produced four such
men as these?” queried Dr. Holmes in
concluding, “Man stands undefeated
in all things that make life better and
these men have been pointing the way
beyond."
