Inability to Small
Sign of Intelligence

Kansas City, Kans, (AC‘P)#
Don’t feel disturbed if you can't
spell simple words like "cat" or
”philoprogenitiveness.“ It may be
a sign of intelligence.

This is an idea attributed to
Dr. J. Duncan Spaeth, President
of the University of Kansas City.
Papers of our greatest statesmen
and politicians show that correct
spelling is not an essential to
success, he states.

Many authors and journalists
can’t spell. A star reporter of the
New York Sun once spelled
”Stork” four different ways in
one story.
