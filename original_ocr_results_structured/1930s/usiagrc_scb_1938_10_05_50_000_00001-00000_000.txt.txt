Instruments, Songs;

This year’s college band is the
best that has been on the campus
in three years, in the opinion of
Kenneth Weidauer, newly elected
president-of the organization.

“We have better instrumenta-
tion and better music than in
former years. However, we are
still a little weak in the clarinet
section, and would like mare'clar»
inet players to join," said Welds
auer.

Robert vagner, director of the
band, has returned from Des
Moines where he purchased a new
baritone saxophone and two new
band arrangements for popular
songs.

Vagner said he plans to intro-
duce the songs at the next home
game.

A new drum major, Raymond
Saunders, will lead the band.
which will march at the Central
game, according to ‘tentatlve
plans. -

So far, no feminine
twirlers have been secured.

The band plans to give its first
concert in December.

Definite plans have been made
to go to the Drake football game,
and it is possible that the organi-
zation will be at the Coe game

For 22 years this man has been
connected with the athletic dc
partment, working faithfully each
day, and leaving behind him a
past little known on the campus
7a past of sailing around the
world as an old time sailor, a
past of square rigged ships and
squeeklng‘ timbers, a past which
took him to many countries, walk-
ing the decks of some of the
"old timers” as they pitched and
rolled to the swell.

Dad was told about the wonder-
ful possibilitics for sailors on the
Gieat Lakes herc. However, once
he reached thc lakes, he liked the
midwest so well that he kept
right on going until he arrived
in Peoria, Ill.

and had six children who are now

“Swedish young people are better
informed, in general on interna-
tional problems than are young
people of the United States," in
the opinion of Buiton 0. Young,
instructor in economics,

“However, that does not apply
to Grinncll students entirely," he
went on, “for I find them 'luulsualr
ly interested and well informed on
the international situation,"

Young, who is taking the place
of Earl 1), Strong, professor of
economics on leave, spent last
year on a fellowship in Sweden.

that country in the Stockholm
school of economists. His fellows

an exchange through the Ameri-
can Scandinavian society.

He asserted that the fascist
party is very popular with the
youth of Sweden. but that their
organization is not yet strong
enough to hold a seat in Congress.

The leading universities of
Sweden are organized into nations
very much like the dormitory and
quadrangle organization in Grin-
nell, Young pointed out.

Each nation represents a prov-
ince of Sweden and every student
belongs to one,

The nations are primarily so-
cial organizations on the cam-
puses of the universities, but they
also concern themselves with poli—
