A FUTILE MOVE

With this issue of the Scarlet and Black
official announcement of the change in
chapel is being made. Under the new plan,
two things have been done of major impor—
tance. First, the hour has been changed
from 11 until 9 o‘clock in the morning;
second, the library will be allowed to remain
open.

We have no quarrel with chapel. It has
long been an outstanding tradition on the
Grinnell campus, but we question the ad-
visability of the new plan as a means of
improving the chapel attendance, which ad—
mittedly has been at a lower ebb this year
than ever before, Action was needed, but
we believe that the wrong kind of action
has been taken.

Frankly we don‘t see how the new plan,
which will go into effect Monday, can bene-
fit chapel in the form of increased attellr
dancer It seems ridiculous to us to imagine
that college students are going to be more
willing to go to chapel at 9 o’clock than at
11. The time is too close to the breakfast
hour, and the temptation of getting a bite
to eat during the free 20 minutes will pro—
vide strong opposition to the chapel pro—
gram. In addition, there are many students
whose classes do not start until 9 o‘clock,
and it is rather far fetched to imagine that
they are going to get up in time for chapel
when they can easily get another 15 to 20
minutes of sleep in the morning, and still
get to class on time.

And then the plan provides that the
library be left open, We agree that study
is desirable, but in this instance study and
chapel will not go together. An interesting
magazine article or the morning paper is
likely to exercise a lunch more potent power
of attraction than will any chapel program
so far offered on this campus. And then
some students would be only too glad to be
able to use the time for study.

We feel that this action is futile and
that if the problem of chapel is ever to be
settled something of a different nature must
be adopted. Perhaps, compulsory chapel is
necessary, or again chapel might be entirely
abolished. But whatever the final outcome
is, we do not see how the new proposal will
remedy the chronic ill of chapel—lack of
attendance 7G. E.

WHY NOT ANOTHER CHORUS?

Grinnell college suppolts a men’s glee
club of 24 members and a women’s glee
club of 28 member. 'These organizations

 

THE GRINN'ELL SCARLET AND BLACK

join in making the Vesper choir. We find‘
that approximately 50 Gi'illnell men and
women have an opportunity of choral work.

Cornell college supports a men's and
women’s glee club, it choir, and one other
similar organization. Cornell college sup»
ports 2‘, mixed chorus in which students
\\ ho are not of glee club calibre find lln op-
portunity to improve their Voices and muslr
cal abilitv. A choral society \l'liUSe mcm-
bersllip is not open to glee club singc but
only to tllose who need and desire cal
training would be worthwhile.

There is no reason why Grillllell students
who enjoy choral singing should be (lcllletl
that right merely because they are not
“good enough" for the glee clubs.

There is an obvious need for such an
organization on the Grillnell campus, and
we believe such 21)] Ol'g‘ﬂlli7 Lion could be
established if the students would evince an
interest. Why not then organize such a
chorus, students“? ——J, N.

WHY N0 INTEREST‘.7

What is the reason for the apparent
lack of interest of present day college stu—
dents to politics and goverilil‘lent?

Last Friday evening, the republican
nominee for the governship of lawn, and zl
former Grillllell student, addressed a meet~
ing in Herrick chapel. Only 40 Crime“
students were present for that meeting.
Grillnell townspeople outnumbered the stu-
dents llearly two to one,

Tuesday night, a small number of stu-
dents attended a Democratic rally in the
Alumni Recitation hall auditorium.

Within the last week Grinnell students
have had these two opportunities to learn
directly of national and state issues. And
the student body did not take advantage of
the opportunities offered to them.

There is much that can be said for both
the New Deal and the Republican parties,
We cannot learn too mucll of the issues of
the present campaign in order to qualify
ourselves as intelligent college men and
women.

What is the reason for the apparent
lack of interest of present day college
students to politics and government?

That is what we would like to kJn0§l

PUBLIC SPEAKERS BEWARE
(Creightonian)

Why are public speakers oftentimes misquoted
and misrepresented by newspaper reporters?

if one were to sit down and take a speech
made by some of‘our political speakers today he
would end with as many gray hairs as Rip Van
Winkle. Many public speakers have become min-
ute men in the sense that they prepare nothing
for their talks, and pay too little attention to the
grammar they use.

A reporter is assigned to take notes on a
public speaker and before he has finished his story
for the paper, magazine, or periodical he is forced
to translate the bulk of the speech into the Eu—
glish grammar so that it may be readily under-
stood by the general public, if a reporter were to
write up the grammatical errors, slang, near-pro-
fanity, and ungenerous remarks, made by a public
speaker he would doubtless reoeive many un-
grateful comments‘however he is forced to trun-
scnbe all these errors into a beautifully made
speech,

It would be a. great help and assistance to the
reporter of today, and he certainly needs it, if all
public speakers would analyze their public speech-
es before they give them to an audience,

College men go through hectic cycles As
freshmen they are dumb and they know it, As
sophomores, they don't know it, but they are still
dumb. Upon turning to juniorhood, their profes-
sors proclaim them dumb, but they don‘t care. In
the senior year. they think the professors are
dumb, and the professors don't care.

Those who know, report, “the principal trouble
with the fast young man is that he is not speeding
in the right direction.”

Library to Have ,
Recreational Booky,
Exhibition

A plan to place more emphasis
upon recreational reading is being
inaugurated this year in the col—
lege library, according to Rebekah
Hash, publicity dil'eCtor there.

A comer by the main entrance
has been set aside for an exhibit
to promote an interest in worth-
while reading. Pamphlets and lists
of new books to attract even the
specialized reader will be found
there.

“This arrangement is a new one,
and we hope it proves nopular,"
Miss Hash explained yesterday.
“We plan to change the exhibit
frequently to coincide with events
of interest on and about the cam~
pus," she added.

Next week, in anticipation of
Amelia Earhart's arrival in Grin-
nell. the comer stall will feature
literature by and concerning the
famous flyer,

Women’ s F arenslc Club
Will Hold Tryouts

First and second tryouts for
the Women's Forensic society will
be held tonight and. tomorrow
evenings, respectively, at s o'-
clock, in Main drawing room.

Subjects for the first tryouts
are to be limited to those of all
argumentative and expository na-
ture. and the speeches are not to
exceed two or three minutes. At
the second tryouts, speeches will
be extemporoneous.

A CORRECTION

In the last edition of the Scar-
let and Black, it was erroneous»
ly reported that Mrs. E. E. Har-
ris, newly appointed dormitory
nurse, had been superintendent
of the Community hospital for
the last three years. This was
incorrect and should have said
that she had served as superin-
tendent from 1924 until 1923,
Since that time Miss Esther
Squire, the present superinten-
dent, has been in charge of the
hospital.
