grandfather of our institution of
learning, J. B. Grinnell. J. B. did
Set out for the Wild and Woolly
prairie land, and, according to the
version in “Here Come the Pio-
neers," "climbed up a tree, the coun-
try for to see," and established our
institution at “a junction station,
Section Sixteen on a natural grade
between the Iowa. and DeS Moines
rivers.”

At about the same time that Hor—
ace Greeley gave our grandfather
his sage advice, he wrote a letter to
his political boss in Detroi The

letter is now one of the large collec-
tion of autographs and stamps of
Prof. J. M, Bridgham, professor of
Latin at Grinnell.

Greelcy wrote his letter on tiny
white paper, the kind that a child
might use today. “Boss Bates," he
abruptly begins, and proceeds to ex-
postulate concerning the payment of
an uninteresting loan. The nearcr
the end approaches, the less intelli-
gible is the writing, becoming such
a straw! that modern Grinnell in-
structors would give up the correct-
ing of blue books in despair or insist
on noiseless typewriters being in evl<
dence, Greeley has his dates mix<
ed; although it is already October,
he is unable to remember which year
it is, giving the appearance of it be
ing either 1856 or 57.

Prof. Bridgharn has other remind-
ers of the days of "go West, young
man." Letters with merely a cross
for a stamp and post mark: one
which cost fifty-seven cents to
journey to China; some that bear
the stamp of the steam boat which
took them up the Mississippi river:
others that cost unheard of prices to
go from California across the cone
tinent in the days of the gold rush

Early Track Meet Found Grinnell, Iowa
Competing in Bicycling, Records Show

When thousands of fans step into
the Drake stadium this spring to see
the annual Drake relays, with some
of the classiest trackmen of the na-
tion performing, few will recall the
early days in Iowa track history when
Iowa university and Grinnell college
battled for state honors on the cind—
er path.

The Grinnell athletes have rightly
been named Pioneers, for Grinnell
was not only the ﬁrst to play inter—
collegiate football west of the Mis-
sissippi, but was also one of the early
colleges to come to the front in
track. The ﬁrst Iowa state track
meet on the Grinnell record books is
that of 1890. There are a number of
earlier home meet on record here,
however.

In the 1890 meet, held at Grinnell.
Iowa was winner with 22 points,
Grinnell second with 191/_,, Cornell
third with 71/2 and Iowa Wesleyan
fourth with 3. Ames and Upper
Iowa university took two points each.
At that time a track and ﬁeld meet
included just about all of the col-
lege activities except perhaps chess
and forensics. First place counted
two points and second place one.

 

ThreaLegged Itace
The place kick event was one of
the features of the program and went
to Slottery of Iowa who kicked the
football 187 feet 3 inches while Miller
of Grinnell took second, Zamunt of
Ames won the baseball throw by
tossing the sphere 362 feet 9 inches
and the standing brood jump went to
Ruggles of Upper Iowa university at
12 feet 21/. inches. Lischer of Iowa
won the foil fencing event by forfeit
but Grinnell also took an uncontest—
ed event in the tugrofrwar. Wood-
berry of Grinnell won both the bitch
and kick and the standing kick,
Lyon of Grinnell won the singles in
tennis and Zollinger and Torey of
Cornell came in ﬁrst in the doubles,
The three legged race went to Bar—
rett and Davis of Grinnell. Lewis of
Iowa won the heavyweight boxing by
forfeit and Cobb of Cornell took the
middleweight collegiate title.

The usual sprint, distance and
jumping events were on me program
also, much the same as they are to
day.
