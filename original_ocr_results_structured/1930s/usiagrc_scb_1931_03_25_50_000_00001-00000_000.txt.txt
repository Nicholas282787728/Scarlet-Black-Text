Plans for the revue next year, how-
ever, are being made, according to
FrankzFul'bush, chairman of the Pru-
dities committee of Sigma Delta Chi.
The group is conferring with the
dramatic council in order to decide
upon a place in which to stage the
affair next spring.

No Petition Presented

Halls and cottages have competed
for cash prizes in the past, present—
ing Six acts or skits, each given by
a cottage and hail together. The at-
fair has not been a yearly event, but
has been sponsored by the Grinnell
chapter of Sigma Delta Chi, in con-
junction with the Grinnell drama de-
partment, upon presentation of a pe»,
ltition to the dramatic council. No
petition was presented this year.

Previously, the Prudities, as well
as other college dramatic productions,
have been staged in the Colonial
theater. However, because of the
sound apparatus which is now on the
stage, and the ﬁre hazard which
would be caused by the use of a
large current for the numerous lights,
the building is no longer available.

Campus militios’Inadequate
The high school auditorium, al-
though of a size adaptable to the pro-
duction, is/ constantly in use by
speech, dramatic, and musical organ-
izations there, and could not be used
for the many rehearsals required.
For these reasons, the dramatic
council decided last fall that all
drama productions would be staged
in the auditorium of the Alumni Rec—
itation hall this year. Facilities here
are considered inadequate for the
production of the Prudities.

school Property Used
Mrs. Sara Sherman Pryor, director

tonight, is among the foremost liv-
ing poets, as well as being an econo-
mist and critic. Although his sub-
ject tonight will be “Irish life, litera-
ture and personaliues," he has given
many addresses on agricultural econ-
omy and the cooperative movement.

AE'S poetry is chiefly in short,
song-like bits. "Fragile, mystical ly-
rics” is a characterization of his
poems recently quoted by Miss Elea-
nor Lowden, professor of English, in
a chapel address. ‘

Mr. Morrison was one of three jun-
ior men who tried out for the busi-
ness managership. He had charge of
the March 4 and 7 issues of The
Scarlet and Black during the compe-
tition. Frank Furbush, Des Moines,
was the other candidate up for elec-

last evening.
The men of each building voted to
keep their present chairmen in of-
fice, with the new officers working
under them. Next year’s officers will
meet with the present council of
house chairmen, and will take over
some of the duties, but the larger
share of discipline will continue to
be under the direction of the sep-
icrs.

their chairmen were in conference.
