California Fraternities Try
New Methods of Discipline

LOS ANGEES, Cal —“Necessity is
the mother of invention” runs an old
adage, and when Greek letter fratem—
ities at the University of Southern
California recently were banned from
paddling their pledges by an edict
made by Presr Rufus B. Von Klein-
Snrid they were forced to uncover an
alternative method to keep their neo.
phytes in hand—and find it they did.

Discarding their guiding motto
“spare the rod and Spoil the child"—
another good old adage—the U.S.C.
fraternities through concerted action
taken by the inter—fraternity council
have adopted a “fool-proof”merit sys.
tem that bids [air to instii respect and
demrum in the hearts of the lowly
neshmen pledges.

Under the new system now in opera.
tion on the Trojan campus, a pledge
starts out his fraternity career with a
clean slate. For performing his as.
signed duties in the proper manner
he may earn merits, but if he should
stray from the straight and nan-ow
path he is the recipient of demerits
which can only be removed by doing
additional work.

If penalties of work fail to remedy
a pledge's conduct, he is placed on
probation and if this fails he is ex-
pelled from the group and is denied
the right to pledge another U.S.C.
fraternity during his college days.

De Paul University has been select.
ed by the Federal Power Commission
to conduct a survey of rates and costs
of operating major electrical appli.
ances in the Chicago area.

Columbia university has buildings
and grounds valued at $55,000,000,
while Harvard university is worth
about $125,000,000 and Yale university
about $100,000,000.
