Butler Downs
Pioneer Five
in Fast Game

Conference Champions Win
First of Series 36 to 24;
(70 Return Tuesday.

A teaspoint lead snatched by But-
ler in the opening minutes of its,
game here last night proved too‘
much of a handicap for the Pioneer
cagers to overcome and the Valley
champs kept their league record
Clean with a. 3344 win.

Mason opened the scoring for“
Grinncll with a nice shot from thel
side of the court. Once started, the‘
Pioneers played their faster and tall-
er opponents almost to a standstill.

Deni-nary Gets Tip

None of the Grinnell centers \vere‘
able to cope with the six-foot seven-1
inch Demmary, and as a result the
Bulldogs had control of the tipl
throughout the fray. Except for a:
few instances when the tip was stol-l
an by one of the Grinnell players.
the Pioneers were forced to wait on;
til Butler made a play for the basket;
before being able to gain possessioni
of the ball, |

Four goals by Dick Mason kept
the locals in the running during the
first half. The period ended with
the loop leaders holding a 19-13 lead.
Grinnell cut the margin to four points
early in the last stanza but was un:
able to keep up the fast pace and
gradually dropped farther behind.

Baird Stars

Davis and Batts led the Butler bar-
rage during the latter part of the:
game. Santi held the former to a sin:
gle basket in the opening period, but‘
Davis rang up eight points in the
last half.

Baird, flashy Butler guard, playedl
an outstanding floor game for the
victors and contributed nine points to:
their total, making all of them in the‘
opening stanza. .

Here Again Tuesday

Tonight Drake faces the Butler'
aggregation at Des Moincs in the
first tilt of the season between the
two teams. Monday the Indiana quin-
tet will attempt to make it two
straight over the Creighton Bluejays
at Omaha. The Bulldogs will.returnl
Tuesday for a second encounter with
the Pioneers,

Playﬁlaor
Changes Plans

Mueller Comedy to Replace
Play by Clifton Lamb

“Pokey,” two-act comedy by Philip
Moeller, director of the New York
theatre guild, will take the place of
Clifton Lamb's "She Dyed for a
Prince" on the next program of the
drama department, Mrs. Sarah Sher-
man Pryor announced this week.

This production, together with the
Sullivan operctta, ”Box and Cox,"
will be given Tuesday, Feb. 27, in
the auditorium of Alumni Recitation
hall,

Tale of Pocahontas

“Pokey” is, in the words of Mr.
Mccllcr, “the somewhat historical
tale of Pocahontas." The action takes
place in the time of John smith, John
Rolfe, and Pocahontas, and deals
with the amorous affairs of “Pokey,”
whose ultra—modcrn mother cannot
marry her off because she has fright-
ened away all the tribe's eligible
braves.

“Pokcy” will be played by Marian
Schisscl, and Robert M. Brown will
take the part of John Rolfe. Maurice
Birdsall is in charge of direction of
the comedy.
Original Grnllp

Next on the program of the drama
department is a group of original
plays scheduled for March 20. Lamb’s
play is being reserved for this pro—
duction which is being moved ahead
because it is now planncd to give the
group during spring vacation in sev—
eral Iowa communities. Definite ar-

rangements have not yet been made,
however.

The next major production will be
held the last of April or the first of
May, and it is probable that that

play will also be used for the com-
mencement number.

sents the ten most unusual will re-
ceive a free copy of the yearbook.

Entries may include pictures taken
at any time during the present year,
last spring, or of Grinnell students
during the summer, while the final
selections will be based especially
upon action, large groups, interest-
ing poses of individuals, and campus
views.

The deadline for the contest will
be March 1, rather than March 15. as
previously announced. All students

who plan to enter should notify the
editor at once.

Divide Games

Langall Quintets Drop Two
to Kelly Outfits

A split bill between the Gates and
Dibble quilltets and a double victory
by Kelly over the Langnn A and B
cagers marked the second round
play in the intramural cage tourna—
ment yesterday and today. In the
Gates-Dibble frays which took place
this morning, the latter's A five up-
set Gates 21 to 13, while the Dibble
B team was nosed out 19 to 17 The
Rawson A and R outfits won 18-4
and 1643 respectively last evening.

After trailing 11 to 3 at the half,
the Gates 13 quintet began a rally at
the opening of the last period which
placed it in the lead 19 to 17 as
the game ended. In the first game
of the morning Hemphill, Moore and
Bosrdman combined scoring efforts
to give the Dibble A outfit a narrow
win over Gates 21 to 18. McKee
scored nine points to lead the loscr's
offense.

Rawson's A quintet hcld
scoreless until well into the last
quarter of their tilt. Kayser finally
broke through for a basket. He fol-
lowed it up with a free throw and
another gratis toss by Martens com-
pleted Langan's scoring. Horton
was high scorer with eight points.

In the KellysLallgan B game, the
former hold a decisive lead through-
out most of the game, but a late
rally by Langan nearly closed up the
gap in the final minutes. Thc fine
shooting of Ellis, who whipped in
four goals, was mainly responsible
for the Kelly victory.

David E. Peck, chairman of the lie:
partment of music explains, "Gounod
was essentially an opera composer,
and naturally, the dramatic element
in the music of the Moss is predom-
inant, which is altogether in kccping,
however, with the significance an!!!
spirit of the text. He has in this‘
work, moreover, some of the loveliest
melodies produced in sacred music."
