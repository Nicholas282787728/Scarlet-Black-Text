Players to Give
Funds for Prize
in Graphic Arts

The Griuncll chapter of National Col.
legialc Players voted at a meeting held
Saturday to provide funds for the
1935 Henry York Steiner Memorial
prize in graphic arts, which was to
have been omitted this spring.

in announcing the decision of the
organization, its adviser, Sara Sher.
man Pryor, stated that the group
decided that it would give the graphic
arts award rather than the one in
playwritingias was also considerodi
as all of the enu~ants in the latter con.
test are members of the Collegiate
Players society.

“Dr. Steiner had wished last year
to have one of the Memorial awards
given in dramatic writing, but r'or
lack of worthy entries the contest in
this field was nothcld," Mrs, Pryor ex.
plained. “At that time it was decided
that a prize should be given
this year for play—writing, and
the Players felt that the award should
come from the income of the original
fund."

The organization plans to secure
money for the prize from the profits
on the presentation of the original
plays sometime in the latter part of
April, Plays will be submitted by
Maurice Birdsall, Robert Brown, Rob.
ert Irwin, Barbara Suserls, and Truly
Trousdale, Mrs. Pryor revealed.

She also said that Clifton Lamb, '31,
who appeored for a time last year in
a Broadway production, and who is
now back in Gl'illnell, has joined the
Class in playwriting and is working on
a long play for Negro Characters. He
will not, at course. be eligible to
enter the prize Compctition.

With its share in the Missouuri Val.

at home, two games on foreign courts
will determine the final loop rating
of the Grinnell basketball team. The
locals meet. Washington at St, Louis
Friday night, and Drake at Des Moines
a week later.

Between the two Valley tilts, the
Pioneers will entertain Cos on Feb

Drills on Fundamentals

This Week Coach John C. 'D'uesdalc
is sending his men through drills on
fundamentals, including passing, pivot.
ing, shooting, and plays, in an eflort
to present a better attack against
Washington than the mediocre per.
romance they staged at Creighton in
Saturday nights 36 to 24 dolcat.

The Pioneer record to date includts
seven victories and three deleals. Fivc
of the victories and one defeat were
on the home floor, while the Pioneer
travelling record shows two Wins
and two losses, indicating that the
locals must turn in a better out of
town performance to hold their pre.

With the defeat of Washington by
Washburu Monday night, the Pioneers
were assured of third place in the
conference even if they should drop
their last two tilts. One more victory
will place them in second place, and
two wins will assure them of at least
a share in the title.

Washington, Friday night's oppoa.

Dress, Settings
I Give Atmosphere
to English Farce

“Crammer Gurmn’s Needle," which

takes place in the 16th century when
English villagers were full of vim,vigor,
and alc, is a slapstick farce written
by “Mr. 5, Master of Arts." Under the
direction of Truly Trousdcle, the play
will be presented at 3 o'clock Friday
evening in the auditorium of Alumni
laccuatiou hall.
l That the pl' was originally writ.

{the boisterous disagreement between
Crammer Gurton and Dame Chattc
Ladies in that day and class were def.
initcly not ladies, and their undlg.
.iiied quarrels frequently resulted in
knock—down and drag—out battles.

The lower class section of an Eng.
lish village provides a colorful setting
with its typical thatched roofs and
casement windows. Crammer Gurtons
abode and Dame Chatte's inn, Ye
Tankard and Mug,” face each other
.on opposite sides of the street.

Voluminous pctticoats and ragged
calico frocks, patched with gaily con.
trasting biLs of fabric in conspicuous
and plausible spols. envelop the nmplc
proportions of Dame Chattc, Gan-liner.
and their maids. The molc characters.
