THE BRITISH CHALLENGER

Not yet 20 years old, Randolph Churchill has
come from his native England to give his views on
international questions to America. He deals with
the London Naval treaty, the Indian problem, and
qucr, is behind the times. True, the idea of political
conquest through war is becoming obsolete and
there is comparatively little unexplored land on
the socialist movement, to name but a. fcw'of his
topicsl -
.His opinions are deﬁnite, and he is not at all
heSItdnt about condemning beliefs with which he
does not hold. Strangely enough, he is c conserva-
tive, or perhaps the strangeness lies in the fact
that he is so aggressively conservative that he is
campaigning against socialism, paciﬁsm, and other
cherished liberal movements.

The Literary Digest ﬁnds that young Mr.
Churchill isshocking America With his ﬁery speech-
es and positive opinions, And if America is being
shocked by him, doesn’t that fact reﬂect unfavor-
ahly on those who are Randolph Churchill’s cge‘l
Doesn’t it indicate fellow countrymen do not con-
sider that people of college age are thinking scr-
lously of present day problemsl The Literary Di-
gest urticlc reads: “He is something short of 20 l . .
at an age when most young Britons and Americans
are still at their game.”

_ Many American undergraduates are “some-
thing short of 20” and are “still at their games,"
but it is time that they were emulating the young
Briton in question and taking an active interest in
national and world affairs. College people are prone
to center all their attention on themselves and their
school, and to forget that there is a busy, swift
changing world beyond the academic peace in
which they live.

Generally speaking, a little more regular and
thorough reading of newspapers would give the
college student a more balanced conception of his
universe than he seems now to have, Education is
to teach one to live more fully, and surely that
end is not served by detachment from national or
world happenings.

The little storm of editorial comment raised by
Mr. Churchill’s lectures hcrc brings home the fact
that American youth as a whole is not supposed
by its elders to have any really serious interest in
world affairs. Heywood Brouu writes of Churchill:
“I would. not deny the right of opinion to anyone.
Thoughts of an interesting kind may come in adol-
escence,” but he is surprised that one so young
should have well deﬁned opinions or that they
should be ‘worth listening to.

Mrl Brouu naturally forms his opinions from
the young people he knows, and who in all proba-
bility are too much like the majority of those not
quite 2kstill at their games. The sarcasm of Mr.
Broun‘s reference to the “little Dipper” reﬂects
on all the rest of the “nippcrs” c charge of super-
ﬂciclity. It is up to college students to do some
Worthwhile thinking if they do not .admit that
this charge is deserved. G .....

STUDENT COUNSELORS FOR FRESHIVLEN

Recently a group of upper clussmcn were sc-
lected to cooperate with Shelton L. Boatty, dean
of men, in counseling with freshmen The .outstimd»
ing duty which falls to the counselor is to discover
the scholastic standing of his charges and, by on-
dlyzing the causes of low or mediocre grades, cu-
deovor to show his freshmen how to raise their
standings i

Actually, however, this involves the problem
of the freshmun’s adjustment to college life in its
many phases, ththcr the under classmau is get-
ting enough social life or is participating in oth—

)1lm,v lire llm'oling loo lunch lime to outside work. of sonata recitals for violin and piano
in Herrick chapel at 8 pm. Tuesday.

The upper (‘lllsblllt‘ll will try to devise pllllls to l'tjlll-
ally or at lczl llllCYllllC this situation.

The plllll is it good one. Professors can give
f shmeu the ‘gcucillll methods of effective study
in college, but they do not have the time to deal
with cllch lllLllYlLllhlll separately. Moreover, there
cannot be the close intimacy between professor inld
student that there is lelu'ccu‘ student and Student.
Also the upper 'clllssulcn can see the problems of
freshmen from their angle, the student side.

The beneﬁt does not accrue to only one party
of the counsel. The freshman can help the upper
classluml, and the latter should feel amply repaid
by the satisfaction of using his own experience to
help someone .clsc. The success of the plan lies in
mutual cooperation. G

REALM OF INVENTION

The modern youth, who, like Alexander, lil-
lucuts because there are no more worlds to con-
thc earth, but ill the realm of invention there cw
worlds unknown, and possibilities realized as pol
sibilities but not as facts.

Take chemistry for example. The man who in
vclits a practical device, which, when hooked on
to the furnace at home, will save the byproducts
of coal will he a hero, Ill many cases the byproducts
of coal are for more valuable than cool its a source
of heat. Coal gives ammonia gas, the main product
utilized in tile manufacture of nitrates. Nitrates
are the most important of soil fertilizers, and are
indispensable to crops. Laud which does not con—
tnin nitrates soon refuses to grow wheat, corn, etc.

The soil of Europe, which has been worked
for centuries, would be completely worn out now
w :e it not for fertilize . Actually Gerlumiy pro-
duces twice as much wheat and potatoes per acre
as the United States, showing what fertilizers do.
Other coal products are the famous aniline dyes,
used in all lines of clothing manufacture; benzene,
a high explosive known {is toluolcnc; saccharine
sugar, ctc.

THAT COLLEGE HUMOR BREAK
(From the Southern Calilornln Dally Trojan)

“Conventions never accomplish anything" is a trite
but rather true saying, Such a statement does not apply
to the Western Association oi College Comics conven-
tion. which adjourned Saturday on the Southern Cali-
10min. campus,

After see-sawing for five years, the editors and mana-
gers deﬁnitely decided Saturday to sever their associa—

tion with the national magazine. The reasons given are ’

terse (College Humor's misrepresentation of college life;
misrepresentation to advertisers that College Humor
reaches the college readers better than do the local

comics, and hindering the independence or the college ,

comics); yet these who have worked on the staffs of
the campus comics will ﬁnd behind those reasons a back-
ground of continual dissatisfaction with the policies 0!
the national magazine

The Western Association or College Comics repre-
sents only a small group of magazines, ranging from
Colorado to Seattle and Los Angeles. Yet it is to be
hoped that other associations throughout the nation will
be able this year to break off just as deﬁnitely,

Incidentally. Bud Fetterly. president or the associa-
tion, deserves praise for his handling of the convention.
The business sessions were really business sessions; the
social affairs of the four days were hailed by the visit-
ing delegates as “smooth.” All in all. it was for more
than just another train ride for the visiting delegates

G—

TOO MUCH COLLEGE SPIRIT
(From the Waterloo Courier)

The East is wont to look down upon the West with
more or less condescenslon in the matter oi undergrad-
uate spirit in institutions of higher learning, contending
that the comparative crudeness or our younger civiliza-
tion here shows itself at its worst. In this connection
it is interesting to observe the circumstances which
resulted in the suspension of 42 Princeton students,
following a Wild demonstration on the eve of the Chi-
cago genie.

Emerging from a "pep meeting” which seems hard-
ly to have been necessary, the undergraduates tied up
trafﬁc by pushing parked cars into the middle of the
thoroughfares. threatened to upset busses ﬁlled with
passengers, wrecked a theater ticket heath, turned on
ﬁre hydrants and dragged a statue from its pedestal.

Dean Gauss, commenting on the affair, said it ex—
hibited “downright muckerism" and described it as “the
ﬁrst time I have ever had to feel thoroughly ashamed
of 2]. group of Princeton men."

These hoodlum-like acts of. vandalism. remember.
were committed by students attending one of the “big
three," traditionally regarded as models for other lesser
schools. It will be fortunate if our middlewestem col-
leges and universities do not follow their lead in this
any more than in other things.
