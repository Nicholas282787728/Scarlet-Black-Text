It will not do for posterity to re-

ceive only an inaccurate version of

masterpiece. In The Scarlet and

Black of last Wednesday an old song

as quoted as follows:

Said Prexy Main, I won't disdain
to make the college grow, -
But every man must plot and plat
to help me raise the dough, etc.
NOW lhls is an interesting gloss but

the authorized version reads:

It is my aim, says Proxy Main,
to make the college grow,

And every man must plot and plan
to help me raise the dough

I will be obliged, as the author or

these lines, it you will do what you
'csn to nip the erroneous version in
the bud,

Dope Favors Dibble Nine
in Outdoor Baseball Race;
Schedule to Open Monday

Although Coach Lester Duke has
not yet announced the complete
schedule, next week will see the open-
ing of the intramural outdoor bases
ball season with games Monday, Tucs-
day, and Wednesday. Several contests
will probably be scheduled for Sat-
urday.

Dibble hall is favored to take the
honors this year with some exper-
ienced men including Duncan, Mc-
Creary and Ferrara. Track will take
several of the Langan stars while the
Gates nine will be weakened by the
loss of Kukolich who will also be
working with the cinder squad,
Clark and Smith will be unknowns
in the race, with Building Three no
a possibility for top honors. The Ruff-
Woody battery will be performing at
par but lack of support has proved
the dilemma of this sterling combines
tion in previous seasons and may do
so again.

Slionlil Griuiicll adopt.
whereby elegihility for additional ac
tivities demands n given number of
grade points?

.viiiic Culbertson: No. because
grade points aren't a very good meas-
ure of work done anyway, It depends
on the professor and the course,

Chhri Lettun: Yes, I feel that there
should be some system by which out
side activities might be more widely
distributed among students and not
limited to a certain few. The system
as suggested would accomplish this.

Leo Henson: The present plan of
eligibility seems adequate to me.

Myron Pilbrow: We must keep all
lthe activities functioning. Therefore,
I am in favor of the present system.

Sidney Skoug: No, because grades
do not determine ﬁtness for outside
activities any more than they do for
athletics. Some get more out of ac-
tivities than class work anyway.

Candace Pannird; No, outside ac
tivities provide more experience for
later use than class work in some
cases, The limited number 0[ active

ies would make it necessary for our
college leaders to choose their activi-
ties antl the .college would have less
participants.

‘Young Friend’
Lauds Grinnell
as Near Ideal

“The conditions described by this
alumnus border on the ideal,” writes
the editor of “The Young Friend” in
regard to an article on Grinnell col-
Meeting of College Women'lege in that magazine. “Hence our
‘interest." The editor's note further
assures the reader, “John 0. Kent:
story of Grinnell in not an advertiser
ment for the college,"

“The Young Friend" is a periodical
published by the young people of the
Society of Friends, or Quaker church,
of Philadelphia, and John Kent, a
member of that group, graduated here
in 1930. The article deals with free-
dom of thought and religion on the
Grinmll campus,

Kent characterizes the Gates lec-
‘tures as “the nearest approach to an
annual revival meeting”. He contin-
ues, “Even those who brag that they
have yet to cross the chapel doorway
hang around and try to ﬁnd out
whether they have really missed
something of worth.”

The article mentions the voluntary
morning chapel, the church afﬁliation
program, the speakers, and the stag
dinner among the accomplishments
of the ‘Y,’ and the vesper service. The
tradition of freedom of thought is
stressed throughout. and the article
concludes, “The only religious com-
pulsion comes from Within."

because of interest they have mani-
fested in Grinnell and are to be shown
a section of Grinnell life. They will
arrive Friday afternoon and stay unzl
til after vespers Sunday afternoon.
During their stay they will live on
fourth floor of Central cottage.
