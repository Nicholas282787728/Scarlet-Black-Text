Choir Group Presents Natural _
Interpretation of Swing Music

By Carl Niemeyel‘.

In spite of its great present popu-
larity, modern music is decadent.
It is a morbid exaggeration of
something that negro musicians
still do better than we do. Jit-
terbugs who disagree should hear
the Eva Jessye choir, which ap-
peared Tuesday night in Herrick
chapel.

All the music was "swung"
(even, incidentally, the Dohnanyi
“Rhapsody” played as a solo by
the accompanist), but whereas
white or-chcstias emphasize the
nervous tension of Swing music,
these negroes paid more attention
to strong rhythms and group soli-
clarity.

Although such music is cel‘talnr
1y appealing, the enthusiastic re-
sponse of the audience was not
due to purcly musical reasons,
The vivid gestures which accome
panied each song were as enter-
taining as the music itself.

They were unselfeconscious and
seemingly unstudied, When leA
bett makes the same gestures in
singing a spiritual, he is acting.
When the negroes make them,
they are, or at least give the im—
pression of being, perfectly hate
ul‘al.

An audience that. had as much
fun as did that on Tuesday night
would no doubt object to .any
criticism that found serious fault
With the choir. One need only
point out that some numbers, such
as "Dry Bones" and the “Steel
Driver's Song," were more popu-
lal' than some others.

The most interesting music was
in the Gershwin selections from
"Porgy and Bess,” although this
writer found them as he finds all
Gershwin, fragmentary and sug-
gestive rather than completely de
veloped musical ideas, The best
tune on the program, “The St.
Louis Blues," appeared only incie
dentally to another song. It was
pleasant to hear the familiar
"Swing Low" in an unfamiliar
arrangement.

SO much has been said in the
past’ about the negro soul as it
appears in the negro music,

about its melancholy and its ten.
derncss and its humor, that there
is no need to repeat it There
was plenty of the familiar charm
7the charm of the lovable un-
spoiled ncgro of “The Green Pas-
tures."

If that negro is now amyth, the
myth is at least one\we are glad
to see kept alive, especially if it
can be done as engagingly as the
Eva Jessye choir does it.
