‘Stage Door, ’ Drama Production,

Not Like Butchered Screen Play

By John Marion

After seeing the motion picture
version of his play, “Stage Door,"
George Kauifman, coauthor, said:
“They should have called it ‘Screen
Door.’ "

It is true that this
butchered by the movies when
'thcy produced it. The whole
thing was changed in so many
ways that what came out could
hardly be called “stage Door.” 50
when you see the dream departs
ment’s production of this play,
don't be surprised at its not re
sembling that oi the movies,

The play takes many slams at
the movies which naturally were
left out in the screen version.
The young playwright in the stage
production is a character sketch
of Clifford Odets, himself a play-
wright and ere-husband of Luise
Rainer. In the motion picture, he

play was

was not given the same part,

Many oi the parts in the screen
version were expanded to make
additional characters. In the Stage
show there is no character like
the o’ne played by Katherine Hep-
burn. Her part and the one por-
trayed by Ginger Rogers are com-
bined into one. In the movies
Gail Patrick had a rather refined
part, and on the stage the char-
acter is a very coarse individual,

Don‘t expect the sinister produc-
er to be like the man Adolphe
Menjou made him, for he is ex—
tremely kind and gentle on the
stage. Also, there are ste parts
in the stage play that were omit-
ted in the motion picture. In the
screen version, more attention was
given to the actress who com—
mitted suicide than is given to
the stage production and there is
no play within a play as there
was in the cinema.

For Glee Club

Organization of
Choral Society Now
Under Consideration

Plans for organization of a choral
society to supplant the two cola
loge glee clubs are now under
consideration, it was learned to-
day from John Yourd, president of
the Men's Cleo club.

It is believed, however, that
Pres. John s. Nollen may soon an.
nounce the appointment of a di—
rector to succeed David E. Peck
who resigned last spring. In such
event the glee clubs will function
as usual.

li no such appointment is forth-
coming thc plan is to combine the
men's glee club, the Women’s glee
club, and the Pioneer chorus into
an a cappclla choir which would
number about 150 members. From
this group a Vesper choir would
be selected and would also make
the organizations’ trips.

The idea of a joint chorus would
have to be approved by all groups
concerned. Yonrd stated. if no di—
rector is named and the proposal
of a single organization is shelved,
the men's glce club will continue
to function in the Vesper choir as
heretofore, but further activity oi
the club will depend upon the men
in the group.

reau are asked to fill out a card,
which will have questions answer-
ing description and personality
traits necessary for pairing,
Cords With Mrs. Bishop.

Cards should be left with Mrs.
Hazel Bishop, hostess at the
White House, headquarters of the
bureau.

"The idea of a dating bureau
has been handled successfully at
other schools,” said Woodward.
“and when such an institution was
suggested at the Brooklyn confer-
ence last week, we decided to try
it in a serious attempt to facili-
tate dating at Grinnell and there-
by aid in solving any so-cailed so-
cial problem that might exist on
the campus."

Confidential File.

A confidential file of the des-
cription cards will be in the

Sage, who will make the pairings
according to data taken from the
cards.

leave his or her iodine and the
occasion of the date with Mrs.
Bishop, who will turn the request
over to the committee.

pairing and contacts the individ-
uals, the plan is for the deters
to meet at the White House or
make other arrangements for the
occasion, Woodward said.

A charge of ten cents will be
made to cover the cost or ar-
ranging the date.

World’s Hottest Records Turn
Carneyites into Jitterbugs '

They call
nowl

It seems that these fellows at
Carney have gone mad for hot
music and dance. In fact, the
place is overly infested with a
rare and savage type of jitterbug.

It all started with the purchase
of a new radio-record player Con-r
bination and records, among which

it "Carney Asylum"

_is the new scorchy recording by

Bob Crosby called “The Big Crash
from China." It seems that this
drummer—man of Bob Crosby's lit-
erally throws the little lads into
tantrums and fits of frenzy as he
“beats it out" with the sticks.

On top of this, the inmates of
Carney received just this week an
order of records, consisting of
some of the hottest, fastest. and
loudest stuff ever stamped on
phonographic recordings.

Among the latest records is ye
olde “Midnight in a Madhouse,"
which is to be the musical theme
of this bild band of jitterbugs.

A ringleader has sprung up
among these Carneyltes. Some
fortunate students have already

had the opportunity of meeting
this distinguished gentleman or
rhythm, who put on no mean
show at the last Women's Varsity.

The dance the young man per—
formed has not yet been named,
but it will go down in the annals
of history alongside with the late
Suzie-Q, Shag, Big Apple, and
Yam.

Believe it if you will, because
every word is the sad truth. If
any student is Still skeptical
about these conditions at the Car-
ney asylum, it is advised that he
pay these lads a brief vis‘ —a
BRIEF visit, because it is Con-
tagious: and unless one has built
up strong resistance, it is most
likely that he will become like the
Carney inmatesia crazy ”Jitter
bug lookin‘ ior a place to jive"
