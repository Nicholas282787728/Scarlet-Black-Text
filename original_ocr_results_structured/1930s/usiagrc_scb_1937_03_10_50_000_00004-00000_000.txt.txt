HATS OFF TO THE CAGERS

Grinnell 43, Drake 40. But the scoreboard did not tell
all of the story of the great battle Grinnell’s fighting Pio—
neers put up last night to win their first contest from Drake
on the cage court in the last two years.

With but seven minutes left to play in the final period,
Grinnell trailed by a margin of 10 points, but then the
Pioneers unleashed a whirlwind attack which completely be—
fuddled the Bulldog defense. Tying the score at 39 all,
Grinnell kept on driving and achieved victory in the over»
time period.

There has seldom been displayed such a fighting spirit
as was shown by the Grillnellians last night. Trailing
throughout the entire game, yet still having that \vill—to-win
spirit which brought victory is ample testimony of the cour»
ageousness of the 1936-37 edition of the Pioneers Games
have been lost, but nevertheless, this year has been one of
the most remarkable in the annals of the basketball sport
here, and it will he a long time before the college will have
an opportunity to witness such gamelless as this year’s
edition of the Pioneers has displayed.

Hats off to the fighting Pioneers!

ONE is 000mm
(Syrhcnse Daily Orange)

Clad in shining armor, with high courage in their hearts and a
firm determination to “right Wrong," the knights of old rode forth
from King Arthur‘s coui-t. Their services, their lives if necessary,
were pledged to the service of women in distress and the oppressed,
of whatever station. They were the guardians of the law, making
war on crime. Their chivalrcus deeds have been sung through the
ages.

Today war is not chivalrous. It is mass carnage, with death
dealt impersonally to helpless victims by a piece of machinery miles
away. There is no warning. The next war, military experts predict,
will be won within the first few hourse sudden attack killing the
enemy before they know there is a war.

And all because the nations that seek to hold what they have,
and the nations that have not must get or starve. Economic neces»
siLy becomes mixed up with national pride, Neither side is able to
see that war has never solved a question permanently.

Brcnislcw Mallnowski, London anthropologist, speaking at the
Harvard terccntenary, declared that war, once constructive, is now
“an unmitigated disease of civilization.” War is a datcd institution.
not a natural human instinct, and must he discarded, he asserted.

A dated institution—war or civilization. one of them is doomcd.

go much farther if he had the background of training." The Univer»

from Housman’s ‘Victoria Regina’

Ann Birk Kuper's Reading
Last Evening Reveals
Queen’s Character

By CARL NiEMEx .lt

If one cannot see Helen Hayes
in “Victolih Regina," perhaps the
best suhstitutc is hearing, as did
the women of the quadrangle last
night, Ann Birk Kuper read, in
costume, selected scenes from the
play. The excerpts were skillfully
chosen to give a good idea of the
play and of the Qucen herself. The
audience first saw the young Vic-
toria and her redoubtahlc mother,
the Duchess of Kent; then her colt
onation, her marriage to Albert,
and Albert-s death

In pleselltiiig thesc scones, con-
stituting the first half or the
play, Mrs, kupci- wore a white
dress with a hoopskirL, For the
second half of the play, including
the scenes with John Brown and
Beaconsficld, and the Jubilee
scene, she were the mourning
dress and thc white cap with
streamers that one has come to

‘cism of last night's performance,
it would probably be that Mrs.
Kilpel“5 Victoria seemed to be
more woman than majesty; yet
even this is readily forgivable
when one considers that the play»
wright was much more interested
in the human than in the regal
qualities of his heroine and that

Listening to a reading of parts
of a play is sometimes an ordeal
for the hearers as well as for the
performer. However, last night's
audience had to suffer no embar-
rassment. The reading was pre-
sented with professional compe-
tence. The German accent. a none
esssry part of any drama dealing
with the last few generations ofl
tho English royal family, was donel
with restraint. Victoria's youth-l
fulness was not made too fresh
and dewy-cyetl. Most important;
the characters were sharply dif—
