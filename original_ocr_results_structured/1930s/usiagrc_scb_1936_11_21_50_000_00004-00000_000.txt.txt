Pre-season informal workouts
seem to indicate that Berry, for-
merly an outstanding guard, may
get the starting call due to better
all-around play. However, all can-
didates will probably see plenty
of action in the opening games of
the season.

At the forward posts, LaMas-
Iney, Robinson. Luther, and may-
ncy will probably be used, al-
though Dean, who played last
year as a guard, may be shifted
to the forward berth, if suitable
backcourt replacements can he
found. candidates for the guard
positions at present are: Dean,
Fowler, High, and COnWill.

The squad will practice Monday
and Tuesday, and Will return im
mediately after Thanksgiving for
a double session of practice on
Friday and Saturday in an effort
to whip a team together in time
for the opening game Dec, 1
