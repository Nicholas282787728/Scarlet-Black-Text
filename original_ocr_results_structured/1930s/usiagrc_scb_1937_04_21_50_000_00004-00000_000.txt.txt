Mentor Finds Gridmen
in Good Condition

 

By SCOTTY McLEOD
Fulltledged block and sock
scrimmage got under way in the
Pioneer spring football camp this
week as coach Guy Lookahaugh
chose two teams from the 35 men
reporting regularly and let the
boys fly at it Evidence that the
men were in good condition was
to be found in the fact that no
major casualties resulted from the
first heavy work.
Three freshman candidates have
served notice in the first drills that
they will make things tough for

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

and the newcomers are badly in
need of seasoning, Berg and Hult.
grcn are the host of the lot.
Backfield candidates are plentir
fiil, but neither large nor versa-
tilc. Captain Evans, Snow, [-10-
mann, and Welton white, the let
termen, are getting a lot of indive

idual attention along with Wal—
lacc. Livcrmore. McFarlin. and
Robinson, veteran reserves, and
Sears and Nash, the best of the
how men.

be the biggest man on the Squad if E

he continues to work in the “(air Smith and Dibble diamondbali

en, is making a strong bid for one
of the tackle positions.
First Lineup From Spring Squad
Lookabaugh's announced intenr
tion of picking a first string line»
up from the spring grid candi-
dates enables the observer to get
a good line on the men who may
be expected to see action next
fall. Shelton and Vaughn are giv-
ing Grimes plenty of competition
for the center and either of them
wit prove a capable reserve.
Spence and West, last year's
watch charm guards. are still
working as a team to oust Jack
Osborn and the aforementioned
’X‘su‘nlrlay from the guards. Five
big rough tackles are havmg a
dandy time trying to show Locke
shangli who is the meanest. Jones.
Moore, wittrock, Woodward and
Harris are the five and the
chances are that they will alter
nate next fall so that fresh tackles
will be available at all times to
muss up the oppositions offense.
The end situation is a little
doubtful. Ricky Boller is the only
veteran available for spring drills

Nash, Smith hurler, set 17 Rawson
batters down by the strike-out
route, as he gave up on three hits.
Smith touched Jensen, Rawson
hurler, for nine base knocks, but
failed to score heavily.
Dibble ran wild in its track meet
encounter with Langan, as the
hurling of Harold High, for ler
bio, and the Langan errors made
the game a comedy of errors. Dibe
ble also chalked up 14 hits off two
Langan hurlers.

Score Heaiily
Clark was donated eight runs in
the first inning of its game with
Gates, when Bill Downey, appar-
ently tired after his inorning
pitching duel with Rawson, walked
in five runs. Max Shelton shut
out Gates for four innings, and
then permitted two runs when his
mates erred behind him. A series
of errors in the sixth allowed
Gates to score three more runs.
