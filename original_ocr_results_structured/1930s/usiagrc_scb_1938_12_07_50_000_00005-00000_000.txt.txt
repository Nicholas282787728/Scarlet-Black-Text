Women Back

Inlramurals

Four Fall Sports
Net 638 Athletes;
Mears Takes Lead

This year the Women's intramural
sports program has fostered a
great deal of interest among the
guadrangle athletes, Margaret
Mordy, instructor in physical edur
cation for women, said today.

About 95 per cent of the women
have turned out for at least one
of the four sports this fall, Miss
Mordy estimated.

The number of participants has
reached 638, including all women
who have gone out for one or
more sports.

The above total includes 107
out for badminton, which starts
this week. First round of the
tournament must he completed by
Saturday night. Finals will probe
ably be played off about Jail 16.

Last year’s winners in the finals
and semi-finals will play again
this year. These winners are Jean
Hill and her two runners-up,
Louise Anderson and Dorothy
Teach. With these veteran play-
ers in the competition, the tour-
nament is expected to be a close
one.

Badminton is the last of the in-
tramural series to be played be-
fore the beginning of the second
semester. This leaves six tourna—
mnts to be played during the sec-
ond semester.

Scores of cottages in women's

. ramural competition to date are
as follows:

Meals leads with 141 points,
and Main follows in second place
with 114 points Haines ranks
third, 105 points; Cleveland, as
points; James, 70 points; Read,
63 points; Pine Tree, 51 points.

Mears won the archery tourna-
ment, with Jean Hainsen attain-
ing the highest score, and also
milked second in hockey and ping

 

RANDOM
SPORT SHOTS

By Clark Smith
An article appearing in the Des
Moines Register last Saturday
placed Grinnell in a bad light re-
garding the faihire to schedule
Iowa university or Chicago of the
Big Ten for our 1939 football
schedule, Written by the Regis—
Lel"s sports editor, Sec Taylor,
one paragraph said, “Gl'lnnell, aft
er asking the state University of
Iowa for a football game to coni-
meniorate the fiftieth anniversary
of thc first gridiron contest be-
tween the two schools. is backing
away from it
, r x

The fact of the matter is that
Grinnell did not back away from
the scheduling of the contest,
Over three years ago, Athletic Di-
rector John C, Trucsolalc opened
negotiations with Iowa for the
game in 1939. Iowa has a policy
not to play other state institutions
in football and in keeping with
this, it turned Truesdale’s sug-
gestion down. As late as this Sep-
tember, Iowa's answer was still
”no."

Crime October, and Griiinell was
in a bad way as far as a football
schedule was concerned. It was
leaving the Missouri Valley con—
ference and as yet had not joina
ed the Mid-West. Schools of the
lattei organization did not want
to play us unless Grinnell was a
member of the conference, because
they figured we would be too
tough for just a non-conference
game Something had to be done
right away to schedule games be
fore it was too late. so fivc con—

by next September.

Besides those five games prom-
ised, Grmnell also had agreements
with Washtvurn, Drake and Colo-
rado college, which completed the
schedule except for the game with
Simpson, Then just two weeks
ago, Iowa changed her policy and
asked Truesdale for a game sept.
30. If the game for that week
end were to be cancellcd with
Carleton, a contract would have
to be‘bl‘oken, and Grinnell would
not be playing the required five
games of the Midewest Confel‘~
ence games, Besides this, on the
next week end, Crinnell would be
meeting Drake and would not be
in condition for that contest aft-
er a bruising battle with Iowa.
The only ethical thing to do “no
der the circumstances was to re-
ject the state university's offer.
Iowa waited too long in making
its decision, Grinnell waited as
long as it could for authorities to
make up their minds, then in pro~
tection of the Pioneers own in-
terests, had to make out
schedule. In all fairness to Carle-
ton and the other schools, the
deals had to remain closed. Chi-
cago was also turned down bee
cause its application dame too
late. Ceitainly, under these cir-
cumstances. Grinnell cannot be ace
cused of “backlng away" from
any contest with Iowa or Chicago,
