in 61-23 Meet

DeLo‘ng, Miller Get Honors;
First Dual of Season

for Pioneers

Taking ﬁrst place in every event,
the Crinnell college swimming team
defeated Creighton university here
yesterday afternoon, 61 to 23. The
meet was the ﬁrst of the season for
both Missouri Valley conference
members.

Two Pioneer swimmers, Wolﬁnger
and Roth, earned their letters by tak-
ing ﬁrst places in the meet. Wolﬁnger
won the 60»yard dash, and Roth fin-
ished ﬁrst in the hundred. Both of
these mermen are sophomores.

Grinnell took the lead in the ﬁrst
event when the Pioneer relay team
of Wolﬁnger, Roth, Pitcher, and
Adams copped ‘Lhe 1004yard relay
test, and Coach Elton A. Rosan's
squad was not pressed to pile up a
big advantage during the rest of the
meet. While the scarlet and black
natators performed as well as had
been expected, the margin of victory
was scarcely a sign of local strength.
Most of the races were slow, and lack
of entries by Pete Wendell, Bluejay
coach, prevented much rivalry.

Deleong’s Rally wins

The loo-yard relay was close with
the Crlnnell team barely nosing out
the Bluejay four, Captain DeLong
was forced to the limit to take Bergin
of Creighton in the zoo-yard back»
stroke event. Bergin led DeLong un-
til the ﬁnnl length, but the Pioneer
swimmer rallied to ﬁnish a foot
ahead. ,

Caroli Wolﬁnger. an addition to
the Crinnell team this season, found
competition to his liking in the 60-
yard dash, beating out Adams of
Gripneil/and Crowley of Creighton.

Thomas Has Big Lead

Miller of Crinnell had no difﬁculty
in the quarter-mile distance event,
and ﬁnished almost three lengths
ahead of Skoug, also of Grinnell, who
placed second. The isolyard back-
stroke sawThomas swimming at pret-
ty-race to take first place. with Durr
spiasher crossed the finish 10 seas
of Creighton. second. The Pioneer
onds ahead of the Bluejay represent-
ative.

The IUD-yard dash attracted con~
slderable interest as two Grinnell
swimmers, Wolﬁnger and Roth fought
for ﬁrst place stroke for stroke, but
as the two men completed the fourth
‘lap together, Wolfinger stopped,
thinking he had ﬁnished, while Roth
breezed on through the ﬁnal length
to ﬁrst place, with Peterson of
O‘eighton coming in second.

' young Blueiays,

A constant changing or lineup
has been the order of events in the
Creighton camp. The start of the
season saw Jerry Dugan at forward,
Van Ackeren and Kelly at forward,
and Captain Melchiors and Davis at
guard. Then Paben, a graduate of
last year's intramural ranks, w'as
placed at guard instead of Davis. .
lteily Relieves Caplaln

Worthing recovered from his knee
injury and was returned to his post
at forward, and Keily was placed at
guard. relieving Captain Melchiors.
Then Dugan was shifted to forward,
with Paben changing from guard to
center in place of Dugan, Chet Bind-
er, formerly a reserve forward, was
shifted to guard to replace Paben.
And finally John Tolan, reserve
guard. was sent in at forward when
Worthing's knee again gave out.

With this constant shifting of men
to obtain the speediest and most ef—
fective combination, it is evident that
SChabinger’s men were at a disad-
vantage in the first three games on
their schedule. Opinion of Jay fol.
lowers, however, is that with more
experience as a team there will come
greater efficiency from the present
combination.

At the present writing, it appears
that the starting lineup against Grins
nell will see Van Ackeren and Tolan
at forward; Paben at center, and
Kelly and Binder at guard.

Spectacular Ploy Forecasted

This team, as it stands, possesses
more speed than any seen on a
Creighton floor for many years. It
is greatly in need of experience, how-
ever, as four of the five men are
newcomers to the Creighton varsity.
The outcome of the Bluejay-Pioneer
game remains in the lap of the gods.
The Jays will be facing a steadier,
more experienced team; a quintet
that defeated Washington, which.
in turn, won from Creighton, And
yet the Jays have the fastest team
in the valley. Creighton will not
play perfect basketball, that is cer-

tain, and yet it can safely be put
down that Creighton can be relied
upon to play spectacular basketball,
and that is what court fans have
long been known to desire.

McCreury Stars
in Daily Practice

Confident that his team has at last
developed scoring power, after the ex-
hibition against Washington universA
ity here Monday night, Coach John
C. Truesdale devoted basketball prior
tice sessions this week to the polish-
ing of offensive plays against the
freshmen.

The.sophomore combination, Dun-
can and Ullrich, although it may not
start against the Creighton Bluejays
tonight, seems to be hitting the hoop
regularly. Scott has been given his
turn at the right forward post. but
still fails to shoot with his usual
accuracy.

The ﬁery playing of McCreary has

been one of the features of the week’s
scrimmages, while Douglas has been
showing his usual heady and steady
shooting. Humphrey and Edman are
still battling for the center position,
with neither one showing much efﬁc-
iency at locating the net.

Captain Huff's knee is still keeping
him from active work, and Douglas
will again lead the Pioneers against
the isluejays.
