Really American
Music Impossible
Composer Claims

Providence, R. l. (ACE—”America
is too heterogeneous to produce a
music which would reflect ethnologice
ally the United States," declared John
Tasker Howard, eminent composer,
author and lecturer in a lecture at
Brown university
"We cannot order the national in
music in the seine way that we order-
a suit of clothes," he declared. point-
ing out the racial mixture which this
nation is What we should aim for,
he asserted is a contribution to the
musical literature of the world.
Tracing American music from the
revolutionary period when it was
fundamentally English and French in
character, Howard alternately describ.
ed trends and played representative
selections to illustrate his points. Ad-
vocat oi national music, he observed,
are ' ing melody arising‘ from the
soil. ghteenth and nineteenth cen.
tury composers who attempted to
create a national music did so by ’porr
traying in sharps_and flats the life of
the India'n', the’ne‘gro. the pioneer
and the cowboy. Conscious effort in
this direction is practically iutile, the
speaker declared.

George Gershwin came in for praise
from Howard, who seemed to prefer
his musical comedy compositions to his
more serious works. Gershwin went

from Broadway to the concert hall

by dint of ambition, and according to
the speaker, the effort was not?
worthy. Howard described his jazz
efforts as “real and alive.” Most jazz,
however, did not meet with the ap.
proval of the authority who said-\hat
it was too standardized. He turther
declared that the rhythm was mono—
tonous.

Howard paid tribute to Oliver Shaw,
blind Rhode Island composer, Stephen
Foster, author of “Oh, Suzanna" and
“My old Kentucky Home," Edward
McDowell, styled, as “rugged individt.
ualist" oi the nineties, and Ethelbcrt
Nevin who "dealt with the artificial
but not in an artiiieial manner".
