Women Revive
Former Theme

The campus in front or hand gym-
nasium will be transformed into a
garden with tall hedges, picket fences,
and a fountain for the annual May
festival sponsor-cu by the women's
physical education department to be
given on May 13.

The theme is similar to one used
several years ago, thc quest for the
moon goddess. The manrm Lhednoon
descends to the earth and visits var
ious countries in search of his lady
lovc. He has adventures in che ry
lblossoin time in old Japan, i a
Dutch garden, in bonny Scotland,
and in a gypsy camp. Each of these
four parts of the program have a
special theme apart from the general
llieine. His search for the goddess
finally ends in the ia‘ y land of
sp ing where the Spirit of Spring be
comes his bride.

Although the framework of the
festival is the same as the one used
‘hefol'e, the pageant will be different
:n all other respect- P’ficticdl'l all

press cne's feelings that counts.”

Mr. Gard is a current contributor
to the New Republic, The North
America. Vanity Fair, and the Read-
ois Digest.
