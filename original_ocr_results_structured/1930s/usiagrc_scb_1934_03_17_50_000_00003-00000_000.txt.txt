It is with great joy that we clll'onr
iolc the fact that the “VestrPutnam
scrap is now a dead issue. Appal'cntr
1y it was just one of those annual
smoke screens thrown out for the
benefit of the public for both are now
back in the fold. Anyway, it gave
Henniiigsen a chance to get a date
with Bertha and gave Bei'thaa chance
to get a date with Lou Van Nostrand
so all’s well.

After being subjected to the ter-
rible bulfetings of fate since her
arrival here as a freshman, Jean M.
Smith has at last found a haven in
the Carlson harbor ivhere she ilp~
parently intends to drop her ﬁn-
chor for a while

The tact that Bill Voss had a date
with Janice Murphy last weekend not
only troubled ~Ross's breast but
aroused a storm of emotions among
various of his Gates hall brethren.
Indeed, Mr. Mattox >was so aroused
that he immediately penned an ode
entitled "From Ross to V055” and ii
is herewith printed with apologies to
everyone: *

Ross no boss

Ross good goss

Ross he toss

Ross plenty gloss

Ross on Moss

but

Ross suffers loss; Ross no joss

Voss cross Ross, Voss mount Hose

Voss know applesauce.

And that, ladies and gentlemen, is
by none other than Richard “Gertrude
Stein” Mattox with further apologies
to Gertrude.

Incidentally, the muse having ole- ‘

scended on Mattox, we are tempted to
dash off a few lines of hexameter,
pentameter or what have you:

it poet named Mottox Irom Gates

Was tempted to write by the fates.

He scribbled a rhyme

That was not worth n dime

save to prove Ross and Murphy

were mates.
