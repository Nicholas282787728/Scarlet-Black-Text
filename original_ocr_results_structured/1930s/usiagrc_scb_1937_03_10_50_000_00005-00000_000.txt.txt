Skill, Artistry Shown
in Ginette Neveu's
Concert Thursday

BY F. WALTER HUFFMAN

Six hundred Grinnellians can't
be wrong: Your reporter would
be unwise to take issue with the
overwhelming opinion in favor of
the violin recital by Ginette Nev-
eu. To quote a punning friend
of mine I might say that “1 NE-
EU heard such a program.

There is no doubt that the
young French violinist won a
deserved victory in her first ap-
pearance at Grinnell. No pel’forc
mer who can play with skill and
artistry numbers or the difﬁculty
of the Strauss “Sonata" or the
Ravel “Tzigane” need ever want
for a permanent and enthusiastic
group of listeners,

Should Become anmus

We are not surprised nowe A
days when it prodigy on the vi -
lio or piano is announced, One
has only to think back a few
years to the knee-trouser days of
Menuhin and Ricci when these
lads electrified the country with
their phenomenal achievements on
the violin. They have now aged

 

a little, as has Miss Neveu (she
is 16), but their art has matured
until they bode well to occupy a
permanent place in musical head-
lines. Last evening Miss Neveu
revealed those qualities of artis-
try, style and technique which
should entitle her to rank in the
violinist fraternity We shall fol-
low her career with no little in-
terest during the next few years,

The program was built in a
manner to present a variety of
types and moods as well as musi—
cal differences attributable to
chronology and nationality, The
early Strauss “Sonata” is a work
of no small merit and justly de-
serves to he ranked with the
famous sonatas for violin and
piano by Brahms and French. It
is Strauss in his more romantic
period—with his usual vitality hut
more oi pneLly and expression.
The hectic ‘Salome’ had not yet
played havoc with his imagina-
tion,,.’l‘he young violinist caught
the poetry of the work and re-
vealed in her performance a grasp
or musical values not surpassed
during the remainder of the pro-
gram.

Lost: half the Grinnell college
Girls Glee club, and one bus. Last
seen: driving around in Omaha.
Vloking tor the VVomen’S club.

This was one of the occul‘rences‘
which the glee club member ex»
perienced on their tour this week
and with which they have been re-
galing the stayrathomes.

The story is told that Tuesday
evening otter the iinal conceit of
the day, the members of the glee
club were on the way to the Worm
en's club where they were to be
honored guests at a reception. But
the bus driver evidently read the
address incorrectly instead of go-
ing to 202 S. Thirt econd street,
the group tried to turd 2025 Thir-
ty-second avenue.

“After we had wandered alollnd
through the residential section,
and a park," one or the members
said Friday, “Jane Timby and ‘02-
zie’ Wiseman stopped and tele-
phoned to the Women's club to
find out where we were! We ar-
ll‘lved awfully late for the recep-
tion, but they received us, any
way," another remarked.
Another loss occurred in Oma-
lm when money belonging to sev-
eral girls was taken while they
were singing for a convention at
a hotel. Marjorie Jamison, Julie
