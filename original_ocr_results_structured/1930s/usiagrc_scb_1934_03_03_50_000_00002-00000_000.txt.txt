NEW DEAL HAS A BIRTHDAY

Today marks the passing of the country’s first
year lulder the “now dcal”—a year which has horn
crammed with ac vity on the part of tile federal
government, inspired and goaded by its new leader,
Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Katherine Fins

As an initiation for the newly inaugurated
president, Roosevelt was asked to save the country
from all extreme financial crisis only a fcll' hours
after tal 'llg office. The ra idity and efficiency
with which he spelled this rst task has charac»
tel'ized the acti'vlty of his administration through
out the first year.

He promised the country bccr; he declared tllat
immediate action wollld be taken to extricate the
nation from the clutch of_ depression; he assured
former legal status llith all due spccd. Holding
former legal status with all due speed. Holdinge
true to his word, beer was being dispensed \l‘ﬁllil‘l
five weeks; by midsummer thousands of uncmploy-
cd were returning to \\'01‘l\ duc to the establishment
of the NF , and in the fall thousands more “'Cl'e
employed at jobs created by CVVA; before the
passing of the old year the deciding state had
rati led the new liquor lalv and 1934 was welcomed
with libations which F. R. had made possible.

Of course his regime has not been free from
criticislnisolnc of his decisions have revealed
flaws, some of his plans have failed. There are
those who doubt that his recovery lilachinery has
been completely impartial to all classes and others
who have eyed solnc of his appointments with skepa
ticisnl. Friend and too alikc, howevcr, agree that
he is headed ill the right direction, and evcn his
enemies do not question his sincerity. He has

given the people every reason to believe that three ‘

more years of thc “new deal” will pllt the country
once more on its feet, a nation economically sound
and socially united.

TRACK RETURNS

With the completion of the llaskethall season,
track once more takes tllc center of the stage. At
Grinncll this means more than at many other
school. since here the production of champion ruli-
ners has become somewhat of a tradition. The lo-
cal runners are spurred on by the memory of such
men as Rush, Huff, Hoyt, Paulu, Taylor and Pil-
brow; men who did much to spread the fame of
their school and whose feats are still discussed on
the campus.

A‘thlctcs in other fields of sport are frequently
wont to look with a degree of colldcsccnsion upon
their brothers of thc cinder path. Running docsn’t
require the stamina and ability to take punish-
ment involved ill football, the gridiron llcrocs
maintain. Nor does it demand tllc agility or quick
thinking required of a basketball player, the lat-
ter dcclarcs. Thc injustice of this attitude is very
apparent to any who engage in track as well as
one of the other two sports.

Let the scoffcr try his hand at hurdling, hroad
jumping or pole vaulting and then question him on
the agility required of a track man. Let him run
a heartbreaking 440 or a gruellingr two-mile
run before he decides it stamina. and ability
to take punishment arc requisites ill ll runner’s
makeup. Let hiln start against a large field in an
EEO-yard run and sec if he still maintains that there
is no headwork involved in track competition.

Although the period of actual competition ill
any of the individual track and field events is com-
parativcly brief, the activity is extremely strcnu-
ous and in reality demands bettcr physical condi-
tion than any other sport on the local athletic pron
gram. So, here’s to the return of track, a sport
wcll worthy of the traditions which Grillncll has
created about it.

AN AGE OF VAST CONFLICTING CHANGES
(Daily nlini)

An historian has said that certain peoples arise in
each historical cycle. contribute their theory of govern-
ment to the world, and then sink into obscurity. The
age of patriarchal rulers has passed; absolute monare
chies have been replaced by constitutional government.

Win democracy soon he in decay beside the kings,
the patriarchs and the Holy Roman Empire?

We are in a period of vast and conﬂicting changes.
New methods of government are evolving and fighting
for supremacy on the ruins of the old. The socialistic
philosophy of Karl Marx became the political religion
of a nation when the Bolshevists released Russia from
the domination of a corrupt church and weak-spined
Czar in 1917. Now Communism faces a new rival govern-
ment policy in the intensely nationalistic Fascist and
Nazi regimes. The Fascism which Mussolini fathered has
taken root in German soil, made fertile by narrow na-
tionalism and selfrpity engendered by the evils of the
Versailles treaty. Adolf Hitler, Germany’s dime novel
edition of Mussolini, is excellently fitted to lead the Ger»
man Fascists, or Nazis. His empty head gives reso-
nance to his glib propagandic utterances.

Austria today is in the harrowing position of being
set upon by the dogs of three kennels: the socialists,
possibly aided by Third International propaganda; the
Nazis, undoubtedly financed and directed by hopeful
German forces, and the Fascists, whose revolutionary
ideas have seeped in across the southern frontier from
Italy.

Japan goes through the pantomime of legislative
deliberation, but essentially it is under the rule of the
army, and the army is the plaything of the Mikado. The
Japanese senate has only pro tempore power-s, limited
by the decisions of army high moguls.

Great Britain, France and the United states stand
as the lone pillars of the democratic ideals of the French
Revolution and Magda Charta. France is upset just now
by a government scandal and bloody rioting in the
streets of Paris, but it is unlikely that the French tlisor-
der will result in abandonment of democracy.

The United states is politically democratic, so dem-
oeratie that very little good can be done without one
man's delegating to himself extraordinary powers, so
democratic indeerl that the Congress and state legislar
tures, wrangling-grounds for illrchosen representatives
of the people, are often deadlocked into complete inep-
titude.

If democracy is to live, blood must be injected into
its veins from the new children of revolution. A. little of
the vinis of new theories, new concepts of society, would
act as a stimulant and euunteractive to revolution for
democracy in its remaining strongholds.

A liberal interpretation of the constitution, new
social justice, constant changeAthese must be the order
of a living democracy.

HAVE YOU YOUR GUN?
(Dany Trojan) ,

No one, except lobbyists and the interests they work
for, will deny that lobbying is the greatest single obsta~
cle to representative government in the United states.
And no better proof of this statement can be found than
the poor success that has rnet any proposal to put the
manufacture of machine guns in the hands of the feder—
al government.

It is admittedly true that the only agencies to pur-
chase the deadly weapons sheuld be peace officers and
the various branches of the army and navy, yet congress
has taken no steps to require this by law. At present
private firms manufacture the guns, and although they
do not make a practice of selling to individuals, it is
relatively easy for gangtsers to obtain them. The use of
machine guns rnade “big time" rowdyisrh possible, put
the police in many cities on the defensive and made fu-
tile for private citizens to resist hold-ups or attempt to
prevent the escape of thugs and robbers. It made crime
pay big dividends. It increased bloodshed. It made the
gangster selfrconfident.

Attempts have been made not only to regulate the
sale of machine guns but of small arms as well, but with
little success. Lobbyists for the arms manufacturers
raise the cry that the citizens have a right to carry guns,
and that this right of self protection must be upheld.
This is perfectly true, but what they overlook is that the
gangster and hoodlum, masquerading as a reputable citi.
zen, can buy firearms over the counter of most hard-
ware stores and from all mail order houses without any
difficulty. In fact they are more apt to take advantage
of this opportunity than the upright citizen.

Against such an obvious danger there should he no
excuse for failing to pass adequate legislation. But with
lobbyists ever alert in Washington any bill restricting
the sale of dangerous and deadly weapons has little
chance of getting out of the committee room.
