WRESTLING. A COMING SPORT

Gl-innell college wrestlers closed their first season of
intercollegiate competition Monday afternoon with a contest
with at Cornell college team, one of the outstanding aggree
gations ill the country, The Pioneers lost 15—13, but the
score is relatively unimportant

What is more important is the fact that Grinnell has
successfully inaugurated at new sport—intercollegiate wrest-
ling. Like most inaugural seasons, Victories were not mim-
erous, but obviously a start was made towards the building
up of a strong liiat team. Coached by thy Lookabaugh,
former Olympic star himself, and aided by a large turnout
of men interested in wrestling, the Sport should develop in
to one of the most popular on the campus. It can develop
if given zl chance, and we are confidently looking forward

to an increasing interest in the sport in years to come.
