Pioneers Get

2-Week Rest;
Creighton Next

Eleven Still in

Grinnell
Running for Valley
Championship

Still not counted out of the fight
for the 1932 Missouri Valley confer-
ence championship, the Crinnell Pi -
neers will be given a, rest this week-
end prior to the homecoming battle
with the powerful Creighton team
here a week from Friday.

Coach Watt's men have a mathe-
matical possibility of annexing this
year's loop championship, if they win
both of their remaining games. Wash—
ington is undefeated, and does not
play Oklahoma A. and M,, but has to
down both Creighton and Drake,
which is considered unlikely.

cowboys Show Strength

The Cowboys showed their real
strength by crushing the University
of Oklahoma by a 7-0 count Saturday,
But if the Aggie team allows Crinnell
to upset it in the climatic struggle at
Stillwater Nov. 18, it will be forced
to relinquish any title claims, for its
percentage would then be .667 as com-
pared to .750 for Crinnell. These fig—
ures are based on the assumption
that the Crinnell team can hurdle the
Creighton obstacle 10 days from now.

Bluejays Lose to Rice

Creighton is not to be taken lightly,
however, for all season long it has
shown tremendous power. Last Sat-
urday its inter-sectional battle with
Rice Institute of Houston, Texas,
ended disastrously, but not until the
Bluejays had run the southerners
ragged throughout the entire first
half to lead 7 to 6. In the second half
Coach Stal‘k's men completely folded
mp and were put to rout, 41-7.

Grinnell is still something of an
unknown quantity, for all the Pio-
.neers lack to be a great team is a
scoring punch near the goal line. In
the last four contests, the scarlet and
black eleven has gained at will in
midfield, only to weaken with a touch-
down in sight. Friday evening it out—
played, outfought, and outsmarted s
Drake university team to win 7 to 0
after the famed Pioneer aerial offen-
sive began clicking.

Wins Has Problem

If Coach Watt can get the Crinnell
passing attack working to perfection,
there is almost an even chance that
the Pioneers can go on to win the
title. The open date this weekend will
provide a much-needed rest from a
strenuous schedule thus far, and give
the squad a chance to prepare for its
final drive.

Monday was a day of celebration
here after the victory over Drake, and
now the work will settle down to the
more serious business of pointing for
the two remaining tilts.

The outstanding developments of
last Week's game were the perform»
ances of Hank (Punkin) Duncan and
Victor Fini. Duncan for the first time
this season showed his 1931 form,
making several excellent catches of
passes from the hand of Clark,

Prodigal Bucket Returns to Grinnell
After 6 Years in Enemy’s Possession

By MARVIN TEGET

Well! Welll The old oaken bucket
has at last come to Grinnell and
seems to have made itself right at
home in the Pioneer camp. We hope
it likes its visit and—well— it does
we'll dig a final resting place for it.
The bucket was donated in 1927 by
interested
in seeing something inspirationally
bright and sacrificially desirable, for
the rival teams to go to battle over.
Since that date this community
drinking cup has remained in the Des
Moines institution and its first mi-
gration began Friday night when
Captain oraflnnd grabbed it from the
well and took it on the first leg of
its journey to the the dressing room.
Since then it has been seeing the
sights of the Crinnell campus under
the watchful guardianship of Cap-

Hall to Assist Tegel
as Co-Edilor of Doric

Following three weeks tryouts.
Arthur Hough, managing editor of
The Scarlet and Black, today hp»
pointed Mary Hall women's editor of
Doric, to act as co-editor with Mar-
vin Teget, men’s editor.

Miss Hall, a junior, attended Grin-
nell her freshman year, transferred
to Webster City junior college her
sophomore year, and returned here
this fall. She is also acting as editor
of the journalism and forensic dc-
partments of the 1934 Cyclone.

Ames to Play
Here Saturday

Freshman Football Game,

Also Scheduled

, ... 1
Ames college varsity reserve grid-

ders will meet the Pioneer reserves'

here Saturday afternoon, John True;-

dale, director of athletics, announced

today. The Drake freshman may also

play the Crinnell freshman at the

same time, but arrangements for this
eme have not been completed.

If both games are scheduled, they,

will be played on Ward field, Satur-
day Mtemoon. The first half of the
freshman game following ttu, first
half of the varsity reserve gun
Then thc second halves of each game
will be played.

In the Iowa State game, the first
15 men on the Pioneer squad will be
ineligible to play. That will include
the lettermen and several other vet-
erans. About 20 men will constitute
the playing squad, some of whi ‘i,
however, have seen action in varsity
contests this season. The same rule
will apply to the Ames grid squad.

The Pioneer Pups will be playing
their first game if the negotiations
with Drake are completed. The vars
sity team here has an open date this
week, although an earlier football
schedule called for a game with Cell»
tral college.

taln Graflund himself, It even went
to thc victory day dance and watched
the affair fr m an honorable and
dignified posi on on top of the pmno
—undoubtedly trying to get in tune
with things around here.

The bucket itself is of the iron
bound, wooden type praised in musi-
cal circles and condemned most
righteously by members of that shal—
wart ‘Society for the Prevention of
Wiggleworms.’ Its sides bear the re-
sults of all Pioneer-Bulldog battles
since 1858 7 the Drake vic-
tories recorded in blue and white and
the Grinnell victory in scarlet and
black. When its sides are covered7
well why worry, perhaps someone
will donate another.

Like all young thingsithere comes
a time when they must leave home
and when they do, they usually stay
away. Sorry Drake

Journalist Finds Death of Candidate

Would Not Stop

What would happen if one of the
presidential candidates died to»
morrow—or any time before the elec-
tion on November 8?

An enterprising journalism stu—
dent at Crinnell college after con—
sulting with Prof. J. c. Cannaway
of the department of political science,
discovers that nothing would happen.
That is to say, under the provisions
of the electorial college system, votes
are cast on November 8 not for the
candidates themselves but for sets
of electors who name the president in
January.

Vote for Party

Consequently, it the death of a
candidate occurred too late for his
party to name a successor before
election day, the ballots would be
cast just the same, Voters would then
be voting for a party, and not for a
man, and would therefore leave the
selection of the real president (Should
the party in question poll a majority)
up to the electors upon the advice
of party leaders.

Nothing of this nature has ever
happened in American history, but it

 

Presidential Election

is a real possibility, and something
that Congress is seeking to provide
for in the new “lame-duck" hmend<
ment which is before the states at
the present time for ratification.

Another point for conjecture arises,
when one considers the possibility
that the president-elect may die after
the electorial college has gone
through the formality of naming him,
but before he is inaugurated. Then
the people would be presented with a
more real difficulty, for the makers
of the Constitutinn have entirely over-
looked this point. There is no men—
tion of any machinery of any sort to
take care of this situation, Under the
new amendment, however, this defect
will be remedied.

It is probable that the vice—presi—
dent—Elect would then take the oath
of vicerpresidcm. and succeed to the
president’s choir but supposing the
vice-president and the president
should both dieiwhat then?

The “lamerduck” amendment pros
vides that Congress Should enact a
law dctcrmining who shall be presi-
dent and how he should be chosen.

Pres. J. S. Nollen will conduct
a district meeting of college presi-
