of disillusionment, which made his
reading unique, was his own.

Margaret Currier. playing And-
rocles' wife, had some good lines;
but her occasional lapses from
the cockney accent were distract-
ing. 1 11 a

Probably the most successful
“bit" part ’ln a play which is
really made up of “bits” was that
of Robert Busby as Lentuliis.
His scene with Ferrovius (Norman
Tscliirleyl was well timed and
was one of the most successful
scenes of the play. Dauphin
Ewart as the emperor was popu-
lar with the audience, but his
interpolations were unnecessary.
Shaw is quite able to speak for
himself.

straight Parts

It is especially true in Shaw’s
plays that the straight parts are
those which require the most of
the actors. for it is Shaw’s heroes
and heroines who are often the
mouthpieccs of Shavian wisdom.

Wendell Butler and Shirley
Evans read their lines well; Miss
Evans was particularly good in
her speech in which she express-
es the vague longing of the
Christian, still half pagan, who
wishes to believe and cannot
quite find anything to believe in.

As for the spectacle, the sets
and the costumes were beautiful.
Even if make-up sometimes lert
something to be desired, the
groupings on the stage and the
incidental business were fine.
Much credit must be given to
Mrs. Pryor, the director, and to
Barry Farnol, her assistant, who
designed and constructed the set-
tings.
