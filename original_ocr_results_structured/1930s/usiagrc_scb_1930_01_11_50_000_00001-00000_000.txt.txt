Pioneers Win

From Cornell
by 15-13 Score

Stage Last Period Comeback
After Trailing, 8-3,
at Half-Time.

Humphrey Is Sta-r

Stops O’Connor and Bolsters Team
when Enters Game; Douglas

Gives Team Lead.

Showing a defense that matched
Grilmell’s offense, and centering of—|
fensive play about one guard bearing
the cognomen of O'Connor. the Cor-
nell college basketmen made a des-
perate bid for victory over the Pie-
neers here last night, only to fail by
a 15 to 13 margin.

Bottling the Grinnell offensive dur-
ing the first half with airtight thor—
oughness, the Purple quintet held the
local outfit to three free throws
Virilhoul. a field goal, Grinnell seem-
ed unable to get near the hoop when
the forwards did shoot. The count
at halftime was 8 to 3. The deadly
accuracy of the Pioneers from the
free throw line was one of the big
factors in the victory.

The work of the old war~horse.
Humphrey, was the outstandingfea-
ture of the evening. Going in near
tbe end of the first half, he bolstered
the Pioneer lineup and effectively
stopped O'Connor, that, son of Erin
sinking only a single free throw af-
tcr Humphrey went into the contest.

DeLoug Looks Good

Humph started the scoring in the
second half With a. field goal and
Cornell was held scoreless while
Grinncll pulled to an s to s tie. Wigs
five minutes to play, Ben Douglas
sent the sphere through the netting
for the basket which gave Crinnell a
12 to 11 lead.

Cornell made a desperate bid for
victory in the final minutes. but
Allen’s field goal in the final minute
was the only score counted.

O'Connor and Welzel were the big
bets in the Cornell stack while
Douglas, Delong and Humphrey held
the honors for Grinnell.

W.A.A. Holds Gay New
Year’ 5 Party Yesterday

Tinsel icicles hung from the Wlnr
dow ledges: artificial snow glistened
on the radiators; a tall, cardboard
clock pointed ominously to midnight;
paper horns blew and gaily colored
confetti festooned the floor and hes
wilder-ed the merry crowd of dancers.
In such an appropriate setting the
w. A. A. gave their New Year's
party yesterday nfternoon. This New
Year's dance, the first affair to be
held in the newly decorated w. A. A.
room in Rand gymnasium, took the
place of the usual W. A. A. Christ-
mas party which was not given this
year.

Miriam McNally, president of W.
A. A., awarded class numerals to
Camilla Stephens, Florence Keefer,
Helen McLaren, Carol Gawthrop, and
Mary Snavely. These girls had earn-
ed the necessary 500 points.

Eleanor King, Dorothy Sells, and
Mary Frances West were in charge
of the decorations and entertain-
ment. A four piece orchestra con—
sisting of Chuck Laustrup, Chuck
Woody, Lester Scott, and Chuck De—
Long furnished the music for the
dancing.

Gard Resigns
From Tanager

Lowden to Succeed Former
Editor for Remainder

of Term.

The acceptance of the resignation
of Prof. Wayne Card as editor of the
Tanager and the election of Prof.
Eleanor Lowden in his place to ﬁll
the unexpired term was voted Thurs-
day afternoon at a joint meeting of
the English and journalism depart-
ments at which Dean John s. Nollen
presided.

Miss‘ Lowdcn, who was formerly
an associate editor of the Tanager,
will take over her new duties Febrile
ary 1.

In resigning from the position
which he had held since thefound-
ing of the Tanager in 1925, Mr. Gard
stated that he needed to devote more
time to his duties in connection with
the joumaiism department, the col-
lege news service, and the Iowa High
School Press association.

Under Mr. Card‘s editorship, the
Tanager has become known as one
of the more important regional mag—
azines of the country, and has been
praised highly by H. L. Mencken and
other literary critics. The magazine
has published the work of many well
known writers, including Gamaliel
Bradford, James Norman Hall, Carl
Sandburg, Lew Sarett, and Ruth
Suckow. The Tanager has been
quoted in many newspapers, maga-
zines, and anthologies, including the
New York Times. the Literary Dig-
est, Braithwalte’s “Anthology of
Magazine Verse,” and O'Brien's
"Best Short Stories of 1929."

Many States Send
Students to Grinnell

Grinnell college is tending more
and more to serve the entire state of
Iowa and to serve outside states, it
is shown by ﬁgures compiled recent-
ly by students in the course in elem-
entary statistics, under the direction
of Prof. Robert J. Myers of the
economics department.

Today Grinnell students represent
83 of the 99 counties of Iowa, and
one—fourth of the students are from
outside the State. Twenty-three
states and ﬁve foreign countries send
students to Grinnell.

The proportion of Grinnell stu-
dents with homes outside Poweshick
and the 7 adjacent counties increased
from 75 per cent four years ago to
81 per cent at present. The propor~
tion of students coming from outside
the nearest 21 counties has increased
a per cent in the same period, and the
proportion coming from outside the
state has increased 4 per cent.

0f the four cities, outside Crlnnell,
which send the largest number of
students to the college, two are in
outside states. These four leading
cities are Des Moines, Omaha, Wat-
erloo, and Chicago.

FORMER STUDENT DIES.

Edward Bonnifield, student at Grins
nell last year, died at his home in
Ottumwa this week from an acute El.-
tack of appendicitis. He took a lea/:1-
ing role in the play “Expressing Wil-
He", presented here last year.

 

Payne Says U. S. and
Together to Make

“While tLhe League of Nations has

been misunderstood and misrepre-
sented, and while it is a marvel that
it survived the atmosphere of cyni—
cism, fear. hate and s;spicion which
prevailed in die world the ﬁrst ﬁve
years after the War, it has made
rapid progress in the past ﬁve years
until it has become today a true
Parliament of the World where na—
tions meet and come to understand
each other, and hence a great agency
for world peace,” stated Professor
Charles E. Payne in a chapel talk
yesterday morning on “The League
of Nations.”

Picturing the double burden which
those who supported the League
from the beginning had to bear——
that of making it a "going concern"
and of educating the world up to it,
Mr. Payne indicated some of the
great achievements of the organiza-
tion in the ﬁrst decade of its exist-
ence. Among them he named the
establishing of the World Court, the
work of the International Labor of-
ﬁce, the rehabilitation of the ﬁnanc-
es cf Austria and Hungary and pre-
vention of half a dozen minor wars,
the importance of which Mr. Payne
made clear by pointing out that the
Great War started in a minor war.

U. S. Uses Pilot

“While Europe and the rest of the
world have attempted to attain world
peace through the League, the Unit-
ed states has sought the some object‘
through another route, namely the
Kellogg Pact," said the speaker. "A
great step forward, it has changed
the whole mental attitude to war. It
has made offensive war no longer
noble and honorable. But it has its
weaknesses. It permits defensive
wars: it sets up no machinery for

the first day's play of the intramural
series, At 1:20 the Clark ball A
team began the day's schedule with
a battle against Smith’s A team. At
2 o'clock, the B teams from the same
two buildings played. In the games
that followed, Dibble's A and B
teams fought it cut with Kelly Sta-
ble’s quintets and two games
between Langsn and Four finished
the afternoons contests. Most of the
teams have seen little or no prac~
lice, and as a result, the playing was
expected to be ragged and slow to—
day.

In the course of the schedule, the
two teams which will represent each
building will oppose the teams from
all the other buildings, the )3 team
from Kelly ‘Stahles, for example,
playing all five B teams. To the
winner of the series, the intramural
basketball trophy, annexed last
year by Clark ball, will be awarded.

cent clash between the Russians and
Chinese has but made clearer that
the United States. as sponsor for the
pact, should ﬁnd a way to remedy
these weaknesses.

“This remedy lies in closer car
operation with the League,” be con-
tinued. Both the League and the
Pact have the same aim—peace.
But the League lacks American sup-
per —this is its greatest weakness
ﬁwhile the Pact, forwarded by Am-
erica, lacks machinery and a methold
of determining an aggressor, which
the League has. The two agencies
for peace complement each other.
In closer cooperation of America and
the League. therefore, lies the best
hope of eradicating war and pre-
serving civilizution." '

Little Cnropemtion

In refer-ring to the League, Mr.
Payne pointed out that someone has
called it ”the Maximum of coopera-
tion possible in the world at any
given moment." During its ﬁrst ﬁve
years, there was little cooperation;
hence the League was constantly re
ferred to as “dead.” During the last
ﬁve, however, the growth of the spir-
it of cooperation became a constant-
ly increasing factor in the League
and the turning point in its revival
was the admission of Germany in
1926, after a desperate struggle with
the old spirit of doubt, cynicism and
fear.

, "Of the ngue, I believe it may
be said that it has been misundelu
stood and misrepresented, and und-
er-rated by its enemies," even though
overrated by its friends, said Mr.

Social Calendar

‘ is Made Known

Rec Head Announces Seven
Varsities and Numerous
Other Affairs.

The list of dances and social enter—
tainments for the remainder of the
present semester'and for the ﬁrst
part of the second has been an-
nounced by Bob Stevenson, chairman
of the Rec Committee.

The program includes seven var-
sity dances, besides the special func-
tions whose dates have been set. A
week from tonight will occur the
Girl‘s Glee Club banquet. After the
midrsemester formal, the next big
dance will be the annual Honor “G”
ball, tentatively set for valentine's
day, Feb. 14. This dance is sponsor-
ed by the Honor "G" club and the
proceeds go for the beneﬁt of that or-
ganization. Feb. 22 is the date of the
annual Colonial ball, which will be
celebrated appropriately on Washing-
ton's birthday. With the spring
formal set for Mar. 23, the last night
before Grinnell's 679 students discard
their books for a ten days' vacation,
the social schedule is practically
complete up until April.

Sigma Delta Chi’s Brown Derby
Drag comes on May 3, at which
one of the outstanding dance bands
of the country is to play for, and at
which the announcement of the Grill-
nell senior who has "gotten by the

Women Proclaim Life A “Ghmbol” _
as Social Program is Announced

One ﬂeeting glance at the exten—
sive schedule of dances, formsls, balls
and drags printed in today's issue
of this paper will suffice to make
the men, who buy the dance tickets,
collapse in unison, while the women
will doubtless “go into a huddle" and
come out with the weighty decision
that, after all, life is but l1 “gambol.”
At least college life. To one who
looks at the situation cooly, however.
the program offers interesting pos-
slbllities.

Consider, for example, what joy it
must bring to the heart of Grinnell‘s
Adoni (If we haven't forgotten our
Latin, Adonis is singular and was
the ﬁrst to twist the feminine heart)
to discover that after all they will be
able to give all the girls a chance to
frisk and fro with them on the ball
room floor that they had hoped to.
but had feared they couldn't on ac-
count of too few dances.

 

Probably the biggest advantage of
the deﬁnite announcement of dates
far ahead from the masculine view-
point is that one will be able to pin
down that elusive but too popular
"dream girl” right now for a dance
eight or nine weeks off. One can
hear the pleading voice of the timid
freshman: “Hello, Miss McGox‘f-
nuckle. Will you be able to permit
me to go with you to the Colonial
Ball on February 22? You will?
(Takes courage) Well, then, how
about the Brown Derby drag?” And
if she doesn’t shut him off, she'll
probably get a bid to the commence-
ment formal.

If the parties listed come up to the
standard of fewer years, many of
them should be indeed interesting.
Take the Brown Derby drag, for ex-
ample Will the great Phillips be

Pioneers Face
Marquette Next

Play Improved Hilltoppers
Tuesday; Oppose Bears

Next Friday.

Coach J. c, Truesdale's Grinnell
college basketmen, with a record of
two victories matching two defeats,
will open the conference season next
Friday night against Washington
university. The game will be
played at St. Louis and on
Saturday night the Pioneers will also
tangle with st. Louis university
there.

Grinnell will have one more pre—
conference contest, however, that be-
ing with Marquette at Milwaukee
Tuesday night. The game was orie
ginally scheduled for Feb. 5, but was
changed at the request of the Mar—
quette officials. ..

Marquette has shown some rml
improvement since losing to the
Pioneers here early in the season,
trimming Iowa university and bat-
tling the Montana state cagemen to
a standstill. Grinnell will have to be
at its best to take a second victory
from the Golden Avelanche,

When the Pioneers meet Washing-
ton, they will face not only the pres—
ent champs of the Valley, but the
team that this week conquered the
highlytouted Creighton team. whose
early season victories over Oklahoma
Aggies, recent winners over Okla-
homa, Big Six title-holders, and
made them a favorite for the 1930
Valley cage leadership. Last year
the Pioneers came within four points
of defeating the Bears, playing them
to a standstill in a game at St. Louis
which ended 34—31 in favor of Wash-
ington.

Piatigorsky ls Third Artist
on School of Music

Recital Series.

Program ls Varied

Selection Made From Modern and
Ancient Music; Pavlovsky

Is Accompanist.

Called by those who have heard all
the Russian musicians who appear on
the School of Music Recital series
this year the ﬁnest musician of the
three, Gregor Pistigorsky will pre-
sent a program of ’cello music in
Herrick chapel next Friday evening
whose popular appeal will be attest—
ed to by those familiar to the num-
bers given below. He will be ac-
companied by another Russian,
Valentine Pavlovsky.
Piatigcrsky has been in this coun-
try only a little over six weeks, ye't
reports of his recitals have been very
favorable. According to ’Prof.
George L. Pierce, head of the School
of Music, a prominent Chicago critic
recently said of the artist: “He is
the greatest ’cellist who has ever
played in this city," while the shine
enthuaism is observed in reports
which have come from Oberlin col-
lege, where he also appeared. Music
lovers there went so far as to say
that he was me ﬁnest artist ever to
appear in recital at Oberlin.
Selections Difficult
Coming almost directly to Grianell
from New York. where he is 'to give
a concert within the next week.
Platigorsky will play here a program
built to offer the same variety that
Horowitz, pianist, and Milstein,
violinist, offered when they were
here. He will open the program
with two numbers by Frescobaldl.
and from this ancient music. will
gradually bring his selections down
to modern numbers, the composer of
the last, Moszkowski, having died but
a few years ago.

The longest and perhaps most dif—
ﬁcult number on his program is me
Concerto in A Minor by the famous
French composer, Saint-Saens, which
is played all in one movement, The

ing played in America for the ﬁrst
