PIONEERS

Grillllell renews her pridc ill the pioneer spirit
once again, and this time it is the ﬁeld of social
Problems and self government.

Leta Riniker and Georgia Murray, llrcsidollt
and president-elect of the women’s self government
league, say that they have come back from the re
Cent, Convention of women‘s intercollegiate self-
govcrumeul: league, mare than ever convinced that
Gl’innell leads in solution of campus problems.

In particular, the amount of freedom occluded
Gl’lﬂncll women is unusual, and the success with
which the present system works, still more llotr-
worthy.

These two representative women also believt‘
that our housing system, particularly ill its absence
of sororities and fraternities, has simpliﬁed social
and administrative matters.

This is chiefly because Grinnell has always be-
lieved in liberal views, and in facing her problems
squarely that she is in this advanced pos ion.
As long as this tradition prevails, this tradition
which is often called the “Grillllell Spirit," Grill-

Campus publications in recent years have .m-
termittently advocated a liberalizing of the clust-
ing cut system at Grillnell. The cut system here, al-
thoughly admittedly more strict than some, is lunch
more liberal than many. After fill, 18 cuts each se-
mester allow a great deal of privilege. ‘

so much in taxing upper classmcn as well as frcsh-

COLLEGE INFLUENCE
(From the Daily O’Collcgizm)

Is college making Cynics out of young men and
Women?

Certainly a survey of editorial opinion, gleaned
from perhaps two dozen newspapers from institutions
in every portion of the country, would give such an
impression. The only consoling thought derived from
such a survey is the conception that perhaps editorial
opinion of collegiate editors may not necessarily be
taken as a true conception of life.

President Hopkins of Dartmouth college is quite
enthusiastic over modern institutions of higher educa-
tion. His conception, given in a recent address, portrays
the modern scholar in the sublimesl: of moods. Says he:

“The true portrait of the American college would
show a community in which generosity of spirit and
graces of culture are predominant, where eagerness for
wisdom and truth pervades the atmosphere, where the
cooperative enterprise which we call education is car
ried on with mutual esteem and respect between faculty
and students.

“It. would likewise show, to be sure, 'sume degree
of self-seeking and self-indulgence, some effort to arr
rogate special privilege to individual selves, some pride
of opinion, some intellectual arrogance, and some close~
mindedness but these would appear, as they are, merely
as blemishes upon the portrait. Each college generation
has it within its power to reﬁne or to smudge this
portrait.”

President Hopkins is quite altruistic in his beliefs,
and while we look forward with unconcealed delight
to the time when his Utopia may be found, we have
our secret doubts as to an early attainment of such
a conception.

When ﬁrst originated. colleges were devoted to
the moral and idealistic education of those who gath—
ezed there. Thrown together as they were, the young
generations found themselves in the midst of en intellec—
tual and scholarly life, from which they ordinarily
emerged with a diploma, a book education, and a. tear—
dimmed-eye respect for Alma Mater.

But the time has not; yet come when we may con—
sider the cynic in college as a pattern of his mates. no
more than we may consider a drunken student typical
of the thousands with whom he daily associates.

We must, however, Consider the vest inﬂuence which
college places upon the individuality, Despite urgent:
pleas of advisers and deans to the incoming frost: to
“hold. as best you can, those ideals which you bring
here." a change gradually in which the student under-
goes a complete regeneration. .

Whether his ultimate personality he that of a cynic,
a druhknrd, a wise scholar, or prohigate, will depend
entirely upon his innate selfifor except in rare cases,
the man is what he is, and the brief environment of
college days is much too short to completely undermine
every code, and to institute a moral or ethical renais—

sauce.
