Men to Plan
Class Scrap

Freshmen Again to Battle

Sophomores

Plans for the annual sophomore
freshman class battle will probably
be discussed in the meeting of the
council of house chairmen tomorrow
night, Shelton L. Beatty, dean ot
mcn, said today.

No definite arrangements ‘have
been made but the scrap will prob-
ably be staged in a fashion similar
to that of last year under the ward
field lights. Under this system both
freshmen and sophomores try to
carry hoavy sandbags to opposite
ends of the held, each endeavoring to
get more across the line than the
other.

The contest is staged in timed per-
iods with a rest session, and house
chairmen serve as referees, but no
holds are barred.
