of Advances

Homecoming Service Held
in Herrick Chapel
This Morning

“11. is hard for the old grad.
returning to the campus, to be
lieve that the college is actually
hotter than when he was here,
but nevertheless that is the case.”
said President John S. Nollen in
his speech to the alumni at the
holnecmning ellapcl this morning.

Continuing, he said, ”My offia
cihl connection with Grinncll goes
back 38 years, when George Gates
W s president. Grinnell was then
all outstanding college athletical-
ly as wall as scholastically. but
great changes have come, pl‘illcir
pally the dormitory system. These
have created their problems, such
as student government, but Presi-
dent Nain’s faith in the system
is justly rewarded."

Game :5. Symbol

President Nollcn also said that
homecomers are supposedly attracted
,back by the football game. but he
feels that athletics are only a sym-
bol just as the flag is a symbol of
patriotism, and that the game is not
the sole reason for their return.

”Our Grlnnell chapel, too, is a sym-
hot,” the president remarked. “Some
time ago an expert commission, fir
nanced by the Rockefeller Institute
of Moral and Religious Research, Vis»
ited a large number of colleges and
universities in every part of the
country. After their study they were
agreed that the two institutions that
stood highest in their estimation were
Grinnell and Swarthmore.”

Students Show Interest

He pointed out that students are‘

becomingmore and more interested
in that phase of college life, shown
lately by their request to have a
weekly chapel conducted by thum-
selves.

Speaking of Herrick chapel he
pointed out that the students feel in~
stinctively that it is no place for
boisterous outbursts of emotion, say-
ing that during freshman days, al»
though freshmen were compelled to
attend chapel in outlandish costumes.

the service was always quiet and‘
courteously observed. Even students;
starting out on a victory day stopped:

long enough to attend the giving out
of the Pm Beta Kappa shingles a
few years ago.

Gates Lectures Distinctive

“Students and alumni cannot help
being affected by the atmosphere
and tradition left in the chapel by
the many famous men and women
who have lectured there. Also the re—
citals sponsored by the department
of music, the marriages. and even
the funerals which have taken place
here have left. their mar Presirl

- dent Nolleu said.

"The Gates Lecture course," he
continued, "is a thing unique in it~
self. It is hcld each year in February
during the Fellowship conference
here, and has brought to Grinnell
college such famous men as Harry
Emerson Fosdiek, Hugh Black. Blew
hop McConnell, Rufus Jones, and.
Harry Ward."

Enrollment Rises

He also drew the attention of
alumni to the fact that the enroll»
ment at Grinnell college has risen
this year, at a time whcn most
schools have lost. He said that ever
since the depression period just. after
the war, Grinnell has continued to
hold more students for the entire
four year period. with a high per-
centage each year.

In speaking of President Main-s
heroic efforts to provide an endow-
ment for the college, and the recent
gifts of the Ccncral Education hoardl

\V'ashington university grid-
nlml, with clogged determination
and a shifty attack to aid them,
will meet Grinucll college ill the
homecoming game here this after-
noon.
’l‘he Bears will be seeking their
First Victory in Missouri Valley
conference competition while it
will be the first conference game
for Coach L. L. (Fuzz) Watt’s
aggregation. Broth outfits will
probably use shifty attacks stress
lug overhead u-ork.

Polishes Reserves
Dr. A] Sharpe, Washington mentor,
spent most of the last Week. after
losing to Drake 26 to 0, in polishing
his reserve strength. Coach Watt,
meanwhile, with sevoml of his reg-
ulars on the bench, sent the Pioneers
through long drills in aerial defense
and offense.
VVelngal't's return to the Washing
ton eleven during the week. gave the
St, LOUIS observers an impression of
added strength. He provided an out-
standing display of talent in scrim-
mage with the yearlings during the
Week when the varsity men galloped
away with a 2577 victory. ,

Hardin in Shape

Dave Miller and Joe Getlin are out
of the game for the rest of the seas
son but all of the rest of the Waslr
ington aggregation will be in shape
with the exception of Gilbert Knrch-
mer, sophomore back who showed
promise in the Drake contest.

Hord Hardin has been in top shape
with his passing throughout prac-
tices during the week.

Show Spirit

Coach Wa-tt's Grinnell squad rumpr
ed through practice sessions with
plenty of spirit this week, showing
plenty of fire in double scrimmage
sessions against both Grinnell high
school and the freshman eleven dur-
ing the week

McCreary j ned the injured ranks
during the week with a lame knee,
but will be in good shape for the
game this afternoon. John Lake,
tackle, was in uniform Thursday and
Friday and will he rcady for action,
although it will be necessary for him
to wear a nose guard. He received a
broken nose in the Carleton contest.

Duncan Kicks

Thomas went through several drop.
kicking drills during the week to put
him in shape for getting points af-
ter touchdowns. Duncan, who handled
Thomas' passcs in his usual adept
fashion. also went through some
punting practice. He will be called
upon to do the kicking in case
Thomas is taken out of the game at
any time.

Lateral 'passes did not meet with
the success of the forward attempts
in scrimmages, but may he used reg—
ularly today, for they give Grinnell’s
fleet backs, Thomas and Alexander.
an opportunity to get outside the de-
fense with a possibility of long gains.

POSTPONE NIEETING
The council of house chairmen did
not hold its regular meeting Thurs-
day night because of a conflict with
the first presentation of the home-
coming play, “The First. Mrs. Eras—

 

a wagon,

 

er.”
