the 15-yard ribbon.

On an exchange of kicks, Forney's
punt was good for only seven yards
before it went out and Crinncll took
the leather 46 yards from goal. James
picked up 14 yards at right tackle,
A pass was incomplete and Thomas
romped through tacklc for five more
yards. He passed to Duncan for a
touchdown on the following play. The
kick failed and Grinnell led at half-
time, 20 to 0.

Spot Pass Good

The Pioneers continued their at-
tack early in the third period, when
Smith tumbled the kickoff and Crin-
nell recovered on the 20-yard line. A
spot pass to Duncan was good for a
score to make it a. 23 to 0 lead.

Ullrich'broke through for 60 yards
on the next kickoff. A 15-yard pen-
alty set Crinnell back but McKee
went for 10 on an cod-around play.
Thomas fumbled but recovered for a
five-yard loss. With 20 yards to go,
he surprised the fans by faking a
kick and romping 21 yards on the
fourth down. Coe braced, however,
and stopped Grinnell five yards
short of the goal.

Reserves Almost Score

Coach L. L. (Fuzz) Watt had most
of his reserves in during the final
quarter. Hagan and Rouse went to
Grinnell’s 15-yard line where Lake
recovered Hagan's fumble to stop
the attack. MeCrear—y split Coe‘s
line for 44 yards and Waite and Al-
exander advanced the leather to the
5-yard stripe where an incomplete
pass over the goal stopped the at-
tack.

The game ended with Coc frantic-
ally trying long passes in midfield.
