From an ordinary recreation room
to a Western range is a difficult
transition, but it was achieved. When
faculty members arrived there for
dinner Thursday night, they found
the sanded tables bristling with cacti,
and strewn with half—inch brim Mexi—
can hats and hits of lndian pottery.
An undeniable attraction was the
Western scene, done with Mr. Col-
hert’s own hands. Coffee boiled over
an open fire. while the flames cast
lurid shadows upon the motley array
of cowboys and cowgirls, lndians,
Spaniards. ‘

Get Own Medicine

After they had “thrown in the
grub," instructors were given a taste
of their own medicine, in the form of
an examination on Texas. Many of
them were embarassed to discover
that they could not name the pﬁncir
pal products of the state, that they
did not know its ports, or its rank~
ings.

it was recently revealed that under-

A royal decree has closed all uni-
versities in Spain for a period of 30
days. All other means of pacifying
the striking students were exhausted.
"Revolutionary tendencies of the stu—

The University of Minnesota holds
an annual “Common Peepul's" ball,
which this year strikes a Bolshevistic
note in its setting. The affair is held
for those who cannot afford to buy
tickets for the junior prom.

At a recent student smoker at the
University of Minnesota 1,200 corn-
cob pipes and a gross of tobacco tins
were passed out and 5,000 cigarettes
were consumed during the course of
the evening,

Miss Clara Julia Anderson, too, was
a redskin, while Miss Elisa Curtis
posed as a Spanish scnorita. An ocv
caslonal war whoop from Mr. Doug-
lass, or a random shot from a pistol,
waked tremors of excitement, but the
real rodeo did not begin until every-
one went down to the little theatre
where contests began.

Duke Serenades Wife.
One quite convincing calf inspired
Jesse Fellows and Mr. Douglass with
such zeal in the calf roping contest
that they were nobly rewarded. Miss
Edith A. Sternfeld and Mrs. Grant 0.
Gale engaged in the suble art of rop-
ing the calf also. and the latter was
awarded a Mexican sombrero.
If no quiver of emotion had yet
stirred, the hardest heart was touch»
ed by the delicate serenades, the like
of which had not been heard before.
Oddly enough, Lester Duke sang quite
sweetly to his own wife, who was
subsequently given an embroidered
scarf, Mitchell Dreese warbled so
touching a tune to Mrs. Douglass that
she won a bracelet. To climax it all,

Endowment Fund 'Article,
Historical Story by Noble
Feature Grinnell land You

The special article of the May is-
sue of “Gi‘innell and You" concerns
the first installment of $316,000, paid
by the General Education board on
the 1920 endowment fund, Almost
32,000,000 has been received during
the lﬂsyear campaign.

The board reversed its previous
ruling that the $475,000 invested in
the dormitories would have to be res
placed since the investment now pays
a normal return. The board also over—
looked its standard ruling regarding
the percentage of scholarship endow»
merits, Grinneli's endowment of al-
most 3300,000 being unusually large.

Another article takes up the new
president and says, “It is a matter
for congratulation on the part of all
Grinhellians that‘ when President
Maiu’s administration came to a sud-
den close, there was a man in the
faculty so exceptionally qualified as
Dean Nollen to assume the heavy and
complex responsibilities of the office.”

Another article in the issue, en-
titled "The Story of Grinnell," and
written by Prof, Charles Noble, is the
presentation of some exerpts from
the opening chapters of a historical
work of which Mr. Nonle. a former
head of the English department here,
is the author.
