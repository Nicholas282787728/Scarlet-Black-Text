THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

‘Wl‘nchellizing’ May Possibly Affect

Language, English Professors Believe

themselves L0 be unfamiliar with
“America's greatest gossip”, and his
hreezy chatter, which is d scmlnated
through his writing and radio broad
costs.

Opinions varied from that or Pres
fessor H. W. Ward of Coo college, who
thought “\Vinchcll‘s many racy ex-
pressions and often startlingly apt
new coinagcs will make a very con-
siderable impression upon our vocab-
ulary." to the indignant pun of Pro-
fessor J. W. Rankin of the University
of Missouri: “Winch? Hell no!"

At the suggestion, however, that
W'inchell’s vestrpocket words, eke
pressing what might otherwise take
a sentence or paragraph, are on mills
ions of tongues the day after they are
coined, Frofessnr Rankin admitted:

“Sad, but true.”

Other English professors, on the
other hand, who did not concede that
"Winchellizing" would effect the
language permanently, confessed
that they themselves enjoy his gossip
and his high~handed treatment of the
language of Chaucer and the Declar—
ation of Independence. The tone of
replies ranged from amusement to
anger.

SPAULDING ELECH‘ED
Betty Spauldihg Was elected by the
members of the Town Women's as-
sociation as their representative on
the student council this year. Thurs-
day morning.

POOL OPEN To MEN

open for recreational swimming for
all men from 2:15 to 3:15 p. m. Tues-

Cub Preachers
Travel 200 Miles
to Talk Sunday

While their fellow students, as a
rule, regard the Weekend as 21. time
for recuperation, two Gl'innell seniors
are spending their Sundays this year
in preaching in Congregational
Churches in this vicinity. Richard
sneed and Hubert Pye. president and
secretory, respectively, of the organi-
zation of Cub preachers in the col~
lege, are the embryonic clergymen
who occupy their weekends in this
manner, and, together, they travel
nearly 200 miles a week in going to
and from their churches.

Mr, sheed preaches at four places.
Searsboro, Westfield. Chester, and
Sonol‘al He alternates, visiting two
of his congregations on one Sunday,
and preaching to the other two the
following weelr. Mr. Pye preaches at
Victor and Cainsworth every Sun»;
(lay. ‘

These two men are the only charter
members remaining in Grihnell of
the organization of cub preachers,
which was founded in 1928 by Royal
.T. Montgomery, director of religious
education for the Congregational
churches of Iowa. l

At the present time. the society,
has six members in addition to Mix“
Montgomery, who serves as its sol-l
viser. The other members are Heir-l
old Franklin, Floyd Dawson, Arthur‘
Tracy, and George Marker. The so-l
ciety meets every Tuesday at 9 pin;
in the Associations' building.
