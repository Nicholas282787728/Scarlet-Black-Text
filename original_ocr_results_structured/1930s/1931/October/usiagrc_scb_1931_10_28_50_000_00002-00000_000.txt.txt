ARTICULATIDN FOR TOWN STUDENTS

Stanley Hipp said, in his chapel toll: Monday
morning, that by articulation in chapel programs
students would do more thinking, and therefore
be more useful college citizens. \Vould that not
apply likewise to the question of town representa-
tion on the student council?

For residents of the quadrangle there is reprer
sentatlon on the council through tllc president of
the league board. for the dormitory men, through
the president of the council of house thairlllen. But
for the TB town men and the 80 town women, what
representation is there on that body?

It may appear, on the surface, that the town
students are represented indirectly by the rcpre-
sentativcs of thc quadrangle and dormitorics’
residents, since the town men have a representa-
tive on the council of house chairlllcll and the town
women, one on the league board. Theoretically
that may seem loaded], but is it so in pl'uctl . The
fact that town students are separated from quad-
rangle and dormitory life is a physical barrier

¥GiA
TO KEEP IN SHAPE

In accordance with the udlllinistrutiou’s de-
sire to make gymnasium work us interesting as
possible, while still getting the greatest brnt‘fit
from it, c new plan is being carried out.

The period is begun with primary oillistllcuics,
followed by more advanced gylllnllstics, such as
tumbling and apparatus work. Finally the students
are allowed to play games they enjoy most, and
thus are givoll a chance to put into practice tho
limberucss, strength, and co-ordination they are
building up.

In the work which is required for graduation
it is the belief of one of the gyllmnsium instructors
that (I good foundation can he built for future
athletes and business men. After two years of this
instruction tho ntlilctc has dcvclopcd n degree of
muscular development and control that will on-
ablc him to pllly his games with more skill and
loss effort than hc would under othe‘ conditions,
thus enabling him to get out of in playing a
greater sntisfcction. The other type of man, he
ullo is interested in zlthlctil only from the sidcr
lines. has onough of it foundation so that whatever
games he is inlercstt‘d in, such handball, tennis,
rind others, will he llhlc to hoop in shape mut‘ll
more easily in tlu‘ limited time he is able to spmid
away frolu his business.

Although this plan lliis been practiced ill Grin»
nell only :1 limited timt‘, mid so could not be suid
to have been thoroughly tested, lllolly stndt‘nts
working under this now method confc s that they
arc getting much more enjoyment from physical
training than they had thought was possible.

CIGARETTE STUBS AGAIN
('From the Belolt Round Table)

The cry for a cleaner, more attractive campus is
becoming an old one at Beloit. Nevertheless it is just
as opportune now as when ﬁrst started. As usual the
worst offender against the cleanliness of our campus
is the discarded cigarette stub, Almost as guilty is the
abandoned candy bar wrapper. We have been in school
only a short time but already the entrances to the new
Morse-Engersoll recitation hall are littered with cigar-
ette stubs, and the porch of Middle College is as un-
sightly as it was last June. Both students and teachers
deplore the litter but Where else can we discard cigar-
ettes and waste papers? of course We can stop smoking
cigarettes and eating candy bars but that suggestion
is a. little far fetched. I don't think that it is unreason-
able of us to expect the administration to supply waste
receptacles at the entrances to college buildings, The
receptacles themselves might be ungainly but not half
so unsightly as littered steps and porches. Why can’t
we at least try them on approval?
