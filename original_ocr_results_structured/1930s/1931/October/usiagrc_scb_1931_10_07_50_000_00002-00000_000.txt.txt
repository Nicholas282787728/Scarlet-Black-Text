CULTURE IN BUSINESS

Entrance illto the business world or some pro-
fessional field bcing the goal of more students ill
this age, vocational training is the thing forcmost
in their minds.

_ With tllat aim, many are enrolled for special-
lzcd‘ business or professional courses. Since the
tines. ion of “what is most valuable“ in the college
curriculum for the prospective business man is
paramount, the importance of courses in foreign
lallguagcs or art may be underestimatcd.

‘ Many business organizations are today favor—
ing the individual with a liberal arts education
over the person with the strictly specialized trainr
illg. They feel that they are able to teach the
young mall business methods, but they cannot give
him cultural training. Only colleges can furnish
hinl that. \thn he is graduated and bcgins his
work, he will not have leisure for cxtcnsivc study
In Sclfrilllpl‘OVeInelll, hilt will naturally concentrate
upon business.

The collcgc man should avail himself of the
opportunity afforded him during his preparatory
period, to take some cultural subjects.

—G__._
THE GREATEST THING IN TILE WORLD

The favorite doctriuc of the head of the Gl'llir
nell .spcct-h dcpartlllcnt is given lipsscl -c by
plally students, hilt is seriously considered by too
cw.

Efﬁciency ’s ollc of tllc ultimate aims of the
college student, whether he realizes it or not. He
is studying higher learning to he better able to
fill hi, placc ill the world. He is presumably the
Velcpilig habits which will make him capable of
doing lilDI‘C work well than he otheruisc could.
No mall part of this training should be that ill
learning how to talrc care of his equipmcllt so that
it will be cffic'ell . Instead, we find college men
and women (I ng themselves to do more than
they proﬁtably call, cutting down nccc ‘sary slccpr
lug hours, even skipping meals in order to do this
or that which they consider more important.

Tllc really educated lll‘ElD is responsive to art,
music, drama, and literature, as well a. cognizant
of different civilizations, economic rclotlons and
business prill plcs. 1 either is he unaware of the
apcarancc of his fellows, nor of the importance
of being wcll groomed. \Vlly doesn’t he appreciate
and strive for the attractiveness that comes with
good health? Why are collcgc graduates, who
should be in prime condition, often nervously or
physically worn out?

Ill school, gylllnasium classes can’t build health
by themselves. Tllc individual must live sauely.
Concentration on a few activities is nluch better
than many scattered intcrcsts, botll for effective-
ness and personal health. A degree of time budget-
ing is indispensable, so that pleasures and friends
will not take study time, and study will not take
rest time, Moreover, a well cst'tblishcd routiuc
makes life much casicr and happier than a coulilr
uous scramble to do something; or get somewhere.

MEET THEM HALF WAY

This wcfk thc faculty ill its weekly meeting
again collsidc'cd the opening of lib ll- tacks to
students, reali illg that :t college library is primar.
ily to allow the students to bc omc better ' cqultillt—
cd with books. The main ol, ctioll again t opcll
stacks, and tllc reason for their being closed two
ycars ago, was the loss of books, many of which
were costly, and some which were unrcplacablc.

If the students will lncct the library ofﬁcials
half; way ill the matter, if they will no longer
make stealing bool ‘ a thing to boast about, then,
and ollly then, will the faculty have a right to
consider student demands. Students arc asking
that stacks be open to them, yet they are offering
no help to the faculty ill preventing or at least
detecting the theft of books.

The Scarlet and Black is not asking tllat the

student council or any othc rumpus organization
establish a police and judiciary 5) tom for the do:
tcction and punishment of the of olldcrs. No .stur
dcllt wishes to be an informer against another. But
it docs advocate that the studcnt body, through
thc student council DI sonic such campus organiza-
tion, ngrcc with the faculty to usc the library and
the stac s as they are rightfully meant to be used,
and to prlvatcly scc that such wholesale robbery
as before depleted the library slacks is stopped.
Students must rcalizc that the person who 'tcals
a book from the librar, is hurting ilic cllti
dent body, because closcd stacks have becll the
answer to the situation every limo.

\Vill the Student body meet tllc faculty half-
way?

WHAT BANKERS THINK

Bankers arc kllowll to be substantial, faresecr
illg busiucss mull, basing their deductions on prov-
cll facts. Ill v ,w of that, the following, published
in tho Alnclii’an Bankers Magazine needs no cxe
planation:

“No business man in ally town sllould allow
a newspaper published ill his town to go without
his llalllc and business being mentioned solncwllerc
in its columns. This docs not mean you should
have a whole, half. or even a quarter page ad ill
each issue of tllc paper, but your name and bu,
ncss should be mentioned, if you do not use more
than a 2-lille space.

“A stranger p illg up a newspaper should
be able to tell what business is represented ill a
town by looking at: tllc paper. This is the best pos-
sible town advertiser. The man who docs not ad-
vel‘tisc his business does all injustice to himself
and the town. Tllc man who lllSrtS on Sharing the
business that comes to town, but refuses to ad-
vertise his own is not a valuable addition to illlx
towll. The life of a town depends on tho livc, wide-
itwakc and liberal advertisingr business men.”

POLICE FORCE?

“In dllc time the police force of the world will
lac in the hands of America.” said Sir Oliver Lodge
some time ago. The appeal of the League of Na
lions indicates his foresight. America’s stand with
the League should help settle the ﬁrst big problem
of its history, llallmly, Japan’s invasion of Man-
chill-la.

In the absence of the chict ministers of‘thc
Europcau powers, it was necessary to securc thc
Ullitcd Statcs‘ support before the Lcaguc could
go ahead ill its duty. Germany has also taken a
deﬁnite Stand with lllc llcaguc.

THE MINORITY RULE
(From the Coe College Cosmos)

The administration of Coe college, by its voluntary
relinquishing and surrendering of certain perogatives in
student government to the student council, has exempli-
fied a very wholesome democratic spirit. This gesture
on the part of the administration contributes to a pre-
vnlent spirit found among students todayga spirit of
desire for Selfrdeterminallon in student affairs and self-
expression and individual conduct. Do we react to these
liberties and responsibilities intrusted to use in a. manner
that is hopeful and worthy? Let us see.

A most regrettable indifference toward the right
of franchise by the citizens of this nation is apparent
at almost every election. Men have fought, risked prop»
city, and even life, itself, to obtain a voice in the are
fairs of government. others frittcr away these dearly-
hought privileges in a manner so careless and thought»
less that the words unpntriotic and criminal come neaiu
er describing their action. Every man who is born into
a. democracy, or becomes a part of it through a due
process of the law, not only comes into possession of
certain inalienable rights but also assumes, with these
rights, certain inalienable duties and obligations. Not
the least of which is—the hallot.

Upon the campus this week was held the election
of class ofﬁcers for the junior and senior classes anti
the representatives of the freshman and sophomore
classes to the student council [or the ﬁrst. semester.

This election presented one of the opportunities of
the year for the voicing of student sentiment. As a
group, it blight be expected that the student body at
r Cue college would rate much above the average of the
citizenry of this country in their attitude toward social
and political obligations. However, the report on the
number of students voting in this important Student-
election is most disappointing and humilating. out of
an enrollment of 732 only 283 availed themselves of
the opportunity to vote last Monday.

DOORS OF‘ OPPORTUNITY
(From the Creightouiim)

For the past few days the bulletin boards have been
crowded with notices of various meetings including pub—
lications, staff meetings, dramatic, oratory, debate, glee
club and various other club meetings. Each notice usualr
Iy contains the words, “This meeting is open to all
students interested,” or a similar expression.

Such invitations as these notices extend, might be
compared to so many rloors of opportunity, waiting to
be opened. They represent not only an outlet for the
particular talents that are possessed by the student but
also a means of gaining in a greater fullness those con-
tacts and associations with fellow students that add so
much to university life.

Surely from the val-led list of extra-Curricular ac-
tivities, each student should find one that appeals. Don‘t.
however, attempt a too strenuous schedule. Concentra»
tion on one or two activities will bring more benefits
than n half—hearted interest in a halt a dozen.

Participation in these various activities will bring the
student closer to a true understanding of the life of the
university. It will give him new interests, new incen<
lives and a gratification that comes with accomplish-
menu. The student active in these channels of univer
sity life is never in danger of stumbling into a rut of
disinterest and consequently he retains the spirit of en
thusiasm which is the main spring of accomplishment.

Extm»curricular activities Should have no need to Ice
peat their invitations. Their value should be easily
recognizable. The time to begin taking full advantage
of these opportunities is right now when they are be-
g‘nning to get under way.
