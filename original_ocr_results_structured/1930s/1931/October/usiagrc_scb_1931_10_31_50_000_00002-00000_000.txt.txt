A DEBAT'ING PROBLEM

Tlle debating season is about to begin, and
once again the system of no .decision debates may
be questioned In the recent past, there has been
no judging debates on the Glinnell campus. No
decisions have been render.ed To many the merits
of this method are not quite apparent.

If such a policy is pursued in this particular
activity, why should it not be extended to others
as well’.I Why shouldn’t the scoring of football
games be abolished, and play only for “the love of
the game?” This is ouc of the favorite arguments
of the proponents of non decision debate, when
referring to that activity. But they answer, there
is a differenceifootball is an athletic strugg 1c,
while debating is purely intellectual. Granting
that, it is still hard to follow their reasoning: There
is nothing transcendental or mystical in the nature
of debating which might justify such a statement.
Both football and debating contain the essential
element of a contest, whether it be between bodies
or minds.

One of the features of debating on this cam-
pus, most deplored by those interested in debating,
is the lack of attendance The reason for this, they
conclude, arises floln the foot that debating a1»
penis to a smallci group than do athletic contests.
which is indeed true. But to introduce lion decision
debating would seem a more which, rather than
remedying this defect, tends to increase it. If on.

A REFRESHING VICTORY

In a period when college newspaper editors .
of the country seem content to rest placidly on a ’

hoop of student. and faculty good will, making
their rrspectivo papers more bulletins of college
announcements, news of Richard Illirdner Tobin.

or setting editor oi the Daily at the University

of licliigou, is more than usually refreshing.

Mr. Tobin. in the last. month, has not minced
wor s. llis paper attacked the alleged drunken
ness of Legionairos at the national convention in
Detroit, It quoted a humor magazine as to Ann
Arbor’ \ standing as a student liquor consuming
center. It opened a drive to b ott free lance

to ob (II‘IVE‘IS and charged graft in the departr V

llwut of buildings and grounds at the university.

Shirley Wheeler Smith, university vicerprcsi-
dent, immediately stopped 917 faculty subscrip-
tions for which the university had been accustom-
ed to paying 1 600 a year. President Alexander
Grant Ruthvou termed the college paper “teste-
less and objectionable” and the managing editor
returned with a denial of sensationalism and a
statement that “the Daily will not juggle news
stories. lf is our intention to stand by that state-
lucnt.”

Since that time it has been decided that the
i‘iccrprcsident exceeded his authority and the
facult tlous were reinstated. The univer-

' ill permit Mr. Tobin to maintain “a free

uuhampercd by administrative iutcrfeiu

’ The ei Ir council at Ann Arbor recognized

the war on taxicabs by demanding the. i talla-

tioll of meters. It was all all around victory for
the student publication.

Graciously enough the newspaper agreed not
to “rub it in” but word of the victory of the slur
dent newspaper there will giro new hope to scores
ol' trembling rollego newspaper editors who eou.
tinulllly four the full of the lmiuistrativc ax.
