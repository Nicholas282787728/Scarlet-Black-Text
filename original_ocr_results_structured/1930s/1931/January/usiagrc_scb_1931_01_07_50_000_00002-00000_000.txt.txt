THE DELAYED OFFENSE

An article dealing witll the opinions of Misr
Sour: Valley conference basketball coaches on the
merits of tllc delayed and fast break offensive prac-
tices In the cage Sport, which was sent out over
tllc_ASSociatcd Press wires dl ing the Christmas
hollda, '. received some editorial comment by nous
paper men of the State,

A Des Moines Tribune-Capital writer sa
“\Vllcn a team is behind it never uses the delayed
offense. It tries to get in through the defense of
the team tllat is ahead. and it tries to score. As a
platter af fact, it is simply a polite name for, . all»
mg.”

. Concedillg that the editorial “is probably
written by a man whose contact with sports has
not been close 'nce his collogci days. it still seems
tllat he is ma g a broad Statement that so 'ccly
can be taken a. true. Grinllcll fans obseu a do
layofl offense ill action at ovcry game here, and
many times the Pionccrs use it when behind ill
the score. It is not a stalling game, used to hold
the lead. but: a delay ill starting for the basket,
tho car lg out of a fully organized play after the
defense is set.

. The Des Moillcs writer goes on to Say that
"the loud cries of disgust that come from the
galleries now indicate how unpopular the present
methods arc,” There have been plenty of loud cries
at Grinnell games, bllt if they’re cries of disgust,
there has been a lot of misinterpretation.

There is no reason why the fans, once accus-
toured to watching the matching of wits in delayed
offense, cannot enjoy that game as much as the
continual pounding of the players from one end
.of the floor to the other, with the hurried and wild
Shooting incurred,js is often the case when two
fast breaking teams meet.

WHAT IS COTTAGE SPIRIT'.7

"Thursday evening the inter-cottage quoit tennis
tournament will he held at the gymnasium. No admis-
Sion."

‘How many people who read an announcement
like that thought: Seriously of attending as an on-
lookerl Not many, ct without too great difﬁculty
the cottage capta , have assembled quoit teams,
and last fall there were good aggregations out for
hockey, archery, and tennis. At thcso tournaments
there w s no cheering gallery. One may, with
justiﬁcation, ask “\Vllat is cottage spirit?” And
”IS it at home in Grillncll'!”

Grant that there is cottage spirit ill the womr
en’s quadrangle. It would Seem to consist of sw t-
ing and ac ing for the house, bllt not chccr lg
when the roommate sweats and aches. It would
seem to consist of vague commcndations of the
virtues of “dear old Moors” without actually fol
lowing the success of its teams.

\Vell, and why not? There is not much chance
for becoming attached to “dear old Mom's” this
year, for it will be “dear old Throo” as consciou-
ciously next year. The fun of the game is admitted-
ly more important than the winning of thc trophy.
But without the idea of the trophy, if not its actual
pursuit, sports wollld become educational and bolt

iug.

THE WORLD’S GREATEST REVOLUTION
India will be essentially free in the ncnr future.
That is, it Will probably have complete ﬁscal auto
nomy, and will hold its own purse strings, accord-
ing to stories ill newspapers yesterday If this is
true, and it must be in its main outlin ', Amer-
ican people have news of the most lgliiﬁcant
revolution in centuries. A country such as the
United States was a scsquirocntury ago, a colony
wanting to command its taxes, has attaincd that
t without ﬁghting a Single battle, or oven

th India’s position seemed worse, for it was
of different and despised race, religion, and civil-
ization from those of the nation which held it in

Presumably the llrrilngclncnts will provide for
the attainment of freedom gradually through about

SHORTENING CHRISTMAS VACATION

How did the cxporilllcnt work? Is everyone in
favor of the “tal raway~Thilnksgiving-Fri(lily-
frolu (‘hristmos-vacation plan?” The vote would no
doubt have been favorable the last. of November, but
the ﬁfth of January ho d some dissenting voices.

To many Gr lllcllians, Thanksgiving weekend
was it pleasant holiday, and one day more or 1ch
ill Christmas vacation made little difference to
them. Howcvcr, Grinlloll has people from distant
parts of the, United Statc‘ lnd those who live far
away could not get home for Thank giving, and
consequently it was doubly hard on them and on
their families to have to cut their Christmas vaca-
tion short.

Added to these objections are those afforded
by tho difﬁculty of traveling by train on Sunday.
Several students were forced to be ill Grinllcll by
Saturday night, or early Sunday morning, because
train connections were impossible on Sunday, and
Monday was “dollar day” for cuts.

Thus, for those who live far away, the new

' tcnl has the disadvantage. of shortening their
time at home, and inconveniencing their travels,

The question is whether or not those two days
instead of one. at Thanksgiving were worth the
trouble and shortening of the holiday vocation
which they cost. The touc of student couv rsatinn
seems to favor a policy of working while you work
and playing while you play. Now, at least, many
think that Monday, Jan. 5. was a precious (ltl'
too precious to pay for one little weekend in No
vclllbcr.

JOYS OF AN EDITOR
(Train rreston, Minn, nepuhlicnn)
Getting out this newspaper is no picnic.
If we print jokes people say we are silly.
if we don't they say we are too serious.
If we clip things from other papers

We are too lazy to write them ourselves;
If we don’t We are Stuck on our own stuff.

If We stick close to the job all day,
We ought to be out hunting up news.

If we do get out and try to hustle,_
We ought to be on the job in the office.

If WE don‘t print contributions.

We don't appreciate true genius;

And if we do print them, the paper is filled with

junk.

If We make a. Change in the other fellow’s writeup,

we are too critical;

If we don't we are asleep.

Now like as not some guy will say:

We swiped this from some other paperin DID.

BACK TO THE CAMPUS
(From the Des Moines TribunaOapitol)

Iowa's “back to college" movement is under way.
Institutions of learning in various parts of the state
have joined in urging young men and women who have
dropped out of college to go back and complete their
CDul‘ses in this period of Slack work. This is good advice,
even though in some cases its acceptance will uecessie
tate the borrowing of money,

Anyone leaving school just now is badly handl-
capped by the unemployment situation, since experienced
workers nearly always are preferred to beginners. He
will benent both by additional training and by entering
the employment market at a more opportune time,

And nearly 'all those who in the 135?. few years have
left college before graduating would proﬁt by dropping
their present jobs and furtherng their education. Their
investment in additional training Will be Well repaid,
and the vacancies they leave will help heads of families
now suffering from unemployment.

Business nrrns, service clubs, and fraternal orders
can help in this “back to college" movement: by on-
Couraging young people to continue or to resume their
educationiwhdtever its natureiaaud by lending money
or giving other assistance to students who need it. The
movement is eminently sound, both as a. means of un-
employment relief and as an encouragement to educa-
tinn. ‘

THE PRESS CONTEST
(From the Control High Record, Sioux City)

A storm of‘ criticism has met the results of the
Iowa State High School Press association’s recent can.
test, according to memorandum sent. out by the assoc-
lotion.

One of the home town papers printed the paragraph:
“The meeting ended in ﬁreworks, many of the schools
vn'thdrawing following the announcement of the annual
press awards, charging the association favored schools
in which Grinnell alumni were instructors,"

The association declares this is not true, which, of
course, we do not doubt, but had they kept a score
sheet and recorded the grades as they were compiled,
they could easily vindicate themselves without sending
needless information to the entire association.

DES MoINESJTwo Grinnell foot-
ball men have been honored with
positions on the All-Missouri Valley
conference football team selected by
Ossie Salem, Drake coach. Capt.
Ben Douglas was given the right
halfback berth, while Royce Minier
was placed ‘at right; end.
Washington and the Oklahoma Ag<
gies each placed three men on the
team, Drake, two, and Creighton,
one.
“Captain Coover of Washington
was the best end in the conference,
while Minier of Crinnell, although
handicapped by injuries, played his
pos ion faultlessly," Said Coach Sol»
ern. “Minler’s work against Drake
was outstanding.”

Milwaukee Railroad Asks
Motorists to Watch Signals
as Crossing Warnings Fail

An admonition against wrecking
their own lives, their automobiles,
and the trains of the Milwaukee
road is directed to motorists in a lull»
letin just issued by the safety de-
partment of the rail-road.

The warning is based on the fact
that during October, when so colliSe
ions occurred an the Milwaukee, 21
were cases where autos were struck
by trains, and 39, or nearly twice as
many, were accidents where Mil-
waukee Toad trains were struck by
autos, All of the crossings involved
