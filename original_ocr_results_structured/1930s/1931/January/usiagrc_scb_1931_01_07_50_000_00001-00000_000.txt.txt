Failure to Sink Gift Tosses

Humphrey Back

, By RANDLE PERDUE
(Special to The Scarlet and Black)

STILLWATER —— Inability to hit
the basket proved Griunell's undoing
here Monday night in its Missouri
Valley conference battle with Okla-
homa A. and M. college, the Aggies
winning. 23 to 16. It was the first
conference game for each team, and
the first of the year for A. and M.

Repeatedly the Pioneers missed
easy shots, and more than a dozen
chances at one—point baskets after
fouls were wide of the mark. Anoth—
er contributing factor to the visitors'
downfall was the stronger defense
displayed by the home team, with
Hensley and Bruner. sophomores.
playing all but 30 seconds as guards.

Highﬂll High Soorel'

In the first ball, which ended with
A. and M. leading, 14 to a. an alert,
hard-driving Aggie offensive account-
ed for the victors' lead, but the Ag
gies slowed up perceptably in the sec—
ond period, failing to score in the
first 12 minutes. More consistent
Grinneli guarding. too, was account-
able in holding down the margin. The
Pioneers were strengthened with the
advent of Humphrey, at center. for
Eamon, who started.

nghfiil. star sophomore forward of
the Aggies. was high man with nine
'polnfs, all scored in the opening half.
Highfiu had several shots in the Sec-
and pedud, but Could not Contact
with the hoop. -

Eight Pioneers Play

Coach George Rody did not make a
chahge in his Aggie lineup until he
sent in Blue, sophomore guard, in the
last half-minute of play. Coach John
C. Truesdaie used eight Grinnell men,
late in the second half sending back
Uilrich, Duncan, and Edman, after
they had been replaced by Rowe,
Scott, and Humphrey. ‘

The scrap was slow, except in spots,
and was ragged because of so many
poor passes and rrequent interrupv
tions by the officials, who called
many held balls and a total of 22
fouls. Grinnell lost Duncan midway
of the second period on excessive per—
Sand] fouls.

o‘clock in Herrick chapel. The Lener
String quartet gave a concert Nov. 4,

tone, appeared Dec. 8.

American tour this season, has proved
that a. Sarcalled “high-brow" artist
can be popular as well. He has played
with orchestras in the East and
Middlewest. and in one season had
the distinction of being rechgaged by
both the New York Philharmonic and
Philadelphia organizations.

Szigetl, a pupil of Hubay. is a
native of Budapest. At the age of
13 he astounded London and Dresden,

Gewandhaus, with the Royal Phil-
harmonic in London, the Amsterdam

of Europe, and in the United States.

.State Law Necessary
to Make Change

"Present day football has shown us
that the successful coach, meaning
one who wins games and ﬁlls stad-
iums,” says H, N. Swanson, editor,
in the February College Humor, “will
be known hereafter not as a mentor
who bclicves in sports to build a
man's body and mind, but as a crafty
stage director who drives his men
and sacriﬁces them whenever scoring
is at stake.

“The successful coach, still meaning
the best showman, will urge his men
to play hard and dangerously. The
public loves a fast running attack.

basketball, hockey. and the other
sports are so important to the school,
the school should do something about
them.

"Business institutions are required
by law to insure workers against ins

a state law, requiring every school to
take out compensation insurance for
all players, except in intramural
sports. In case a man is injured, a
certain sum should go to him until
he recovers, no matter if he leaves
school.

ask that his expenses be paid or ‘his
academic way be made easy. But he
is entitled to the assurance that if
he does get a shattered knee or brok-

need no laws to force them to this.

Washington Quintet, Next
Conference Foe, to Meet
Pioneers Monday Night

Washington university of St. Louis,
cochampions of the Missouri Valley
conference, is slated to meet Grin—
nell here next Monday night.

After the fine showing the Pioneers
made when they conquered St. Louis
university here two weeks ago, 21 to
19, dopesters pointed out that Grin-
nell was conceded a good chance for
conference honors, but the unexpect-
ed lnss to Oklahoma A. and M. has
dampened this prediction. Grinnell's
showing against the Washington
Bears is expected to be a real test
of the locals' strength.

Grinnell has been handicapped this
season by injuries. Coach John
Truosdale's plan of rounding out his
squad sooner than the other loop
teams and playing them early in the
year, has not been successful because
of this jinx of inju s.

Humphrey is coming into shape
rapidly and should be playing regu-
larly the rest of the season. Captain
Ruff’s improvement has been slow,
his leg failing to loosen up as qulclb
ly as was expected.

Ullrich, sophomore athlete who was
operated upon for appendicitis just
before the Christmas holidays, is
playing with the team, but has been
ordered to take things easy and not

 

to run the risk of straining himself.
