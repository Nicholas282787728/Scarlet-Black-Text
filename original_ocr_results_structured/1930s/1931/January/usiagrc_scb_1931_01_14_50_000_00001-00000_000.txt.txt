Grinnell Debaters Discuss
Chain Stores With Drake
in First Meet Monday

Lee Alexander, Frank Hertel, and
Francis Hawk opened the Grinnell
debate season Monday afternoon in
Hobbes hall at Drake university
The Grinnell men upheld the chain
store against an attack by the Des
Moines speakers. A large audience,
composed of the debate squads of
the Des Moines high schools and
their coaches, heard the discussion.

The debate was a no-decision af—
fair. The Crlnnell argument was
centered around the three-fold bene-
fits of the chain system. Alexander
discussed the benefit to the consum—
er in lower prices, Hertel, the benerlt
in the local community, and Hawk,
the good which the nation receives.

acquaint students with the National
Collegiate Players organization and
the experimental theater. Joseph lr.

mental theater through its classes in
production, acting, and play writing.

Miss Luella J. Read, dean of worn.

dramatics to them.

The meeting was concluded after a
talk by Mrs. Sara Sherman Pryor,
director of dramatics, in which she

in dramatlcs, the person should be
tamillar with all branches.
