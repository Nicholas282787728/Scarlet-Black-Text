Council Exam
Predicts High,

Low Scholars

11 of 25 Freshmen Included
in First Group Become

Senior Students

Freshmen who make average
scores in the intelligence test given
at the beginning of the term need not
fear that their class grades will be
affected in the least by this showing.
But if a man is rated in the upper or
lower fifth of his class by the test,
that's a different matter.

A comparison between scores made
by the present senior Class in their
freshman intelligence test, and the
grades maintained by these students
during their three years in college,
provides data for a. report made out
by the department of personnel, and
released to The Scarlet and Black this
asternnoa.

All of the freshmen who entered
Grinnell college in September, 1925,
were divided into 10 groups accord-
ing to their scores on the standard
test published by the American Coun-
cil on Education.

ﬁve of Lower Group Seniors

The grade comparison with the
score made on the test has determin—
ed whether or not there is a positive
relationship between standing in the
examination and scholarship,
measured by grade points. statis-
tics reveal that although those who
were placed in the two highest divis—
ions according to the test have made
the highest grades in their studies,
and those who were in the ninth and
tmth division have made the lowest
grades, the grade poinm made by the
six middle divisions overlap consid-
erably, and show but a slight rela-
tionship with standing in the test.

During the freshman year of 1926
those in the highest divisions made
19 times as many grade points as
'those in the lowest. Out of 25 enter-
‘lng freshmen who were placed in the
first division, 11 reached the senior
year, and of the 21 freshmen whose
intelligence was graded in the tenth
division, five have reached their son—
ior term,

Differentiate: in Scholarship

The average number of grade»
points made by those in the ﬁrst
division for three years is 53, while as
is the average number for those who
were graded lowest in the American
Council on Education test.

"It is interesting to note that this
test does on the average clearly dif—
ferentiate between those who will do
superior work and those who will be
eliminated because of low s holar.
ship. If the test could he adm‘ ster-
ed before students were admitted to
.college, it would be advisable to very
carefully consider the cases of those
‘in divisions 9 and 10 before accept.
ing them as college material," states
'the report.

Faculty club luncheon yesterday noon.

Bluejays Win
Over Grinnell

Pioneer Five Fails to Hold
Margin of First Half
‘ in 30-26 Loss

A lightning-fast basketball team
from Creighton university was re-
sponsible for Grinnell's second Mis-
souri Valley conference defeat here
Saturday, when the Pioneers were
forced to drop a 30-26 decision to the
visitors.

Creighton jumped into an early
lead, when Coach John C. Truesdale
of Grinnell started part of his seC<
and string offense. With the entranée
of the Grinnell regulars into the fray
a few minutes later, the Pioneer out—
fit snapped into form and play after
play was reeled off from the tip-off
to the shot, At halftime Grinnell
held a two point margin over the
Bluejay five, 21 to 19.

Bluejays Stage Comeback

The second half was a different
story as a fast-improving Creighton
team found its stride and solved the
Pioneer offense, holding Grinnell to
a lone basket. Led by van Ackeren,
veteran forward from last year's
crack aggregation, the Bluejays
managed to outscore the local quin-
tet during the period, despite more
difficulty at hitting the hoop than
had been the case in, the first half.

It was a fighting and desperate
Grinnell team that faced Creighton
those last few minutes of play,wben
the Biuejays led intermittently by
one or two points. The Grinnell spirit
at this point in the game could not
Cope with the smooth passing and
floor work of the Creighton team.
