Campus Opinion

What do you think of a plan that
would enable Clint-cu men 00 learn
a minor sport such as tennis or hand-I
hall in their physical training classes.

John Dunluum: Since participation
in major sports is not possible for all
men on the campus. I think that
some plan might be developed where-
by they could take part in a minor
sport of some kind. .

Raymond Peterson: Physical train—
ing classes should consist of calis~
thenics. corrective exercises, and
mass athletics. The fundamentals of
tennis or handball could be be ex-
plained in class. but the periods are
too short and classes too large to
accomplish much.

Frank Beatle; I think minor sports
should he taught. . , .

Rohert Bradford: 1 think such a
plan would be a good idea. Much
better‘than formal gymnasium work
which means nothing to anyone.

like a good idea to me. There is such
a course already.

Should the ﬁnancial accounts of all
organizations on the Grinnell campus
‘ be audited by on outside accountant?
Arline Colo: Absolutely. Too many
organizations keep accounts in a 5107
venly manner. and little. or no track
is kept of the money taken in or paid
out. If an impersonal accountant and-
ited the treasury reports, every cent
would be accounted for, people would
pay their dues better. and organiza»
tions would be run on a more husi-
ness-like basis.

Robert Stevenson: The accounts of
campus organizations certainly should f
be audited. Audited with an eye. not
to ﬁnding dishonest procedures. but!
to encourage more intelligent and
supervised expenditures. All of these
audits should be made public to
the members of the organization at
least.

Marion Johnson: No. I believe the.
persons who are running the accounts

i

are competent enough to audit them of thought, spoke at senior Vespers

Sunday. The theme of his talk was,

themselves.

.ing of student accounts would relieve
many persons of the burden of rumor
which they now hear. It would. in

‘ addition. he a valuable discipline to

the organization itself,

gantzations regardless of their ex—
penditures should have their ac
audited by an outside account t and
then published. Very few students un.
derstand the outlet of the money tak-
en into organizations on this campus.

well organized business demands the
audition of the books of each depart-
ment, so why should not the organi-
zations on the campus be subject to
the same ruling. Only those who
have something to hide will object.

would not only promote honesty but
make treasurers keep a closer ace
