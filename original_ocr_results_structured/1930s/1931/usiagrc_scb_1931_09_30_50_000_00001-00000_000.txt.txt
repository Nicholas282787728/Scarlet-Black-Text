Grinnell‘s Young Men's Christian
asociaticn is one of the oldest or-
ganlzations on the campus. It was
begun in 1334 when a small group
of men gathered for weekly Bible
study.

In 1393 a fund was started for the
erection of a building to house the
organization. This fund was com-
plctcd in 1907 and work on the pres-
ent Associations building was begun,
At that time the north end of the
building was occupied by the Y. M.
C. A. and the south end by the
Young Women’s Christian associa-
tion. The organization also had
charge of the employment bureau,

The work was gradually enlarged

to includc ﬁelds of campus and com-

group is to maintain and promote
high Christian ideals among the
men of Grinnell. On Thursday night
the meetings are in tbc hands of the
religious education department and
are conducted by faculty members,
professional mcn, business men or
students. The campus service depart-
ment has charge of such social
events as the general reception,
stags, and the all college picnic.

The Y. M. C. A. also maintains a
clubroom for the athletic and social
needs of the poorer boys of the city
called the Uncle Sam's club. A Christ-
mas dinner party is given for this
club in the dormitory dining room
cvcry year.

With the co-operation of the Y. W.

freshman handbook every year. Mem-
bcrs also act as group leaders and
advisors during freshman days.

First F Cragn
Game of Year
on Tutor Grid

lnquries to Golz, Rose

Handicap Eleven;
Lurid Reports

Having hurdled the first barrier on
the 1931 football schedule, Coach L.
L. (Fuzz) Watts Crinneil college
eleven is preparing to face a strong
State Teachers college team at Ce-
dar Falls Saturday, In all prcbab
ity a large squad will make the trip
to participate in the first game on
foreign territory this year.
Tuesday night the Ploneers under-
went a strenuous pmctice session in
a scrimmage with Coach Ed Wright's
Penn college gridders from Oska-
loosa. Although they were on the
defensive most of the time, the watt-
men accounted for four touchdowns
through the efforts of Hank Thomas,
who tallied three times, and an 80-
yard off-tackle slant by Alexander.
Again the Pioneers were out-weigh-
ed, but nevertheless held the upper
hand throughout the entire scrim-
mage.

Watt Shifts Men

The loss of Otto 6912 and Al Rose
has forced Coach Watt to make sev-
eral shifts in his lineup. Rose may
see action in the State Teachers
game, but Colz is out for a month
or more. Graﬂund has been used at
fullback with McCreary, and Trum-
bull has been working at Graflund's
guard position in the line, Craflund
won his letter at the fullback post
last year.

If Trumbull returns to his tackle
position, it is possible that Coach
Watt will shift Bilto back to end.
Canavan has plugged a gap in the
other side of the line.

Tutors Won First

The Tutor eleven won its first
game from Columbia of Dubuaue,
19-0 last Saturday. Seven lettermen
form a nucleus for Coach L. W.
(Mun) Whitford. The mentor has
been drilling his men on power plays
with a mixture of passing thrown in.

The probable starting lineup for
the Tutors will be Hackler and Will-
ert, ends; Cowlishaw and Westwick,
tackles; Cole and Sheffield, guards;
Berry, canon/Fisher, quarterback;
Kimberlin, Burley, or Boiler, halves;
Miller, fullback. The work of Boiler,
diminitive back, was a feature of the
opening game Saturday.

James Injured

Coach Watt's starting lineup is
doubtful, but Edman, McKee and
Duncan will see service at the wing
positions The work of Bilto and
Canavan gives them the call for the
tackle berths, although Trumbull may
start at that position. if Graflund is
used in the backfield, Trumbull will
start at one guard, while Rosenbloom
has the call for the other one. Cap-
tain Christotfersen will be seen at
center.

James suffered a slight injury to
his leg in the scrimmage with Palm,
and may not start the State Teachers
game. ‘In this case, the baclrfield
will comprise Thomas, Ullrich, Mc-
Creary, and either Crafluad or Alex-
ander.
