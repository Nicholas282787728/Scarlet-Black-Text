Dear Sir:

The most current rumor on the
campus at present is the student
Boycott against the local theaters he-
cause they haven't reduced prices in
at time when “prices slashed" blacks
ens every newspaper page. Rumor
likewise reports that this’matter will
come up before the council of house
chairmen Thursday night,

The idea has all the essentials that
have popular appeal; it ‘is typically
”collegiate”. Popular things are usu-
ally based on ignorance or suppress—
ion.

Casual conversations with Mr.
West and Mr. Mart earlier in the
year have convinced me that they
have felt no reduction which they
can pass on to the students. The in-
dependent exhihitor has little enough
to say of what pictures he will show
and what price he will pay f .r them.

Don’t thinlr I'm Mr. Gottrnxi
Theater prices do seem a bit stecp.
But as a measure of fairness, would—
n’t it be more typical of crinnclis
fair play if the students, through
their council. ﬁrst conferred with the
theater owners to ﬁnd out if any ad-
Justmeut can be made?

Yours truly,

F. F.
