In speaking of President Main's
ideals, Mr. Bradford mentioned his
belief in student self government as
a laboratory of life, and his desire
for personal contact with the stu—

Shiv Productive Scholarship

Professor Norris saw in President
Main “a great scholar and teacher
united in a rare personality.” He
traced Grinhe‘llls high scholastic
standing to the fact that President
Main was not only a scholar but a
man of foresight who chose a faculty
of scholars. The educator believed
scholarship good in itself but he also
thought and planned a productive and
creative scholarship.

“It remains for students and facul-
ty to carry on the president's dreams.
and to hand on the torch that blazes
a road through the dead wood of tra-
dition," said Professor Norris.

Conﬁdencc in students

“He expected his teachers to be
more than mere pedagogues," Dr,
Steiner observed. “that they be un-
hampered except by the spirit of
truth. He believed his conﬁdences in
the students would never be too great.
Like all idealists he suffered, but was
never without hope. faith. or realiza-

all.his hopes and plans, he left his
ideal unsullied; truth. beauty and
goodness will remain the heritage of
