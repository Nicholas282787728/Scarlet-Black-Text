to the demands of myself and con-

have a nurse. We had realized the
seriousness of his condition long

With the Kansas Relay carnival
scheduled for April 13, Lester Duke.
coach of the Grinnell track squad. has
only one week in which to round his
men into shape. This meet will be
the ﬁrst event on the outdoor sched-
ule of the Pioneers as a result of the
postponement of the home meet.

Coach Duke will take a mile relay
team, and possibly‘ia four-~mile or a
sprint relay team. In addition, he will
enter men in several of the individual
events.

Fair Indoor Season

Handicapped by injuries and inis»
fortune. the track squad came through
the indoor season with only fair suc-
cess. With the return of some of the
injured men. prospects are brighter
for the outdoor season.

As usual, Grinnell will be strong
in the quar‘ter-rnile and the mile re»
lay. The conversion of Murphy. who
won the Missouri Valley indoor half-
mile championship in 1930. into a
quarter-miler has strengthened the
team in that respect. but if Mcnrath

The Pioneers will be fairly strong
in most of the ﬁeld events this year.
Knkolieh and Murray are dependable
in the shot and discus. while Ben
Douglas is a consistent all»around
performer. Grauund was -the most
outstanding weigh't man of last year's
freshman team. Ullrich has been
working with him in thc javelin

Golz and Alexander will garner
