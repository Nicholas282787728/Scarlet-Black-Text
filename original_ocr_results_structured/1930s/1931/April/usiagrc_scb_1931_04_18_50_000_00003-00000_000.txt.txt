Editor
The Scarlet and Black

Grinnell, Iowa

Dear Sir:

The subject discussed in the second
aJlrcollege assembly recently included
the topic of varsity athletics for
women. One speaker said that “as
far as the women are concerned.
varsity athletics are ridiculous!" (He
since has said his purpose in saying
this was “to throw a bomb").

We are quite sure that the reason
for no immediate comeback was that
the statement was so preposterous
that it either ltook the breath of the
women, or intimidated them to think
that the men dismissed Women's ath-
letics with "ridiculous."

Teams of the Best

There is a quadrangle group which
feels that the women have missed a
large part of what college should in~
clude by not having a chance to try
out for varsity teams. We are willing
to accept any sensible reason for
banning varsity athletics for women,
but as yet no criticism of any weight
has been offered.

There is an organization, of which
Grinnell college is a member, called
the Women’s Athletic association. The
spirit of this organization is to pm~
vide exercise for all women, to play
for play's sake, and to discourage
outstanding players. We commend
their efforts to interest as many wom-
en as possible in sports, but why
cent this group continue it construc-
tive work and produce teams repre-
senting the best? .

Health considered

A group of us have upheld varsity
athletics (or four years, and we have
never heard any woman argue against
varsity sports for women, except
those who would never have any
chance to make such a team. or those
who were never interested in sports
73nd at that we know only a handful
who argue against varsity athletics.

peting outside of their school seems
to lie health, and we think this,
7if women are in good health
and work under intelligent super-
vision, athletics cannot hurt them.
The only argument against women's
athletics, which we can see, is one
that we have never heardsthe lack of
funds. This is Sensible and backed by
proof. It seems as if getting "out of
breath" in playing a game labels the
contest as “too strenuous.”

Uphold W.A,A,!

Perhaps the hockey and basketball
games between Cottage Three and
Four were events in which the feeling
was strong, but to the women who
played, it was just good fun. If the
women had been playing Iowa State
or Drake, they could not have played
any harder.

The part that we cannot understand
is this: that the Women who want to
try out for varsity teams apparently
,have no part in the rulings made
against the thing that they want.
Eleanor King, president of W.A,A. at
Grinnell, said that at the recent con-
vention of the organization some
coaches upheld the group's principles.
and their opinions were of great
weight—hut it is a recognized fact
that many coaches are able to show
others how to play a game, and yet
not be adept in the sport themselves.
Maybe these coaches would not have
their positions if they did not uphold
W.A.A.l

Don’t Play to \Vill?

How can anyone who has ever felt
the “pangs” of competition in any-
thing argue “play for play's sake,
don’t play to win?" There is some4
thing lacking in the person who
does not do his best, whether
playing bridge, football, or whats
that. Competition is a propelling force
in life. There need be no bitterness in
competition if both sides do their best
and accept the better team as winner.
Women have a reputation for poor

 

to work on teams with other women
and this reputation Wlll soon be wit)»
drawn.

Varsity sports could have meant
one of the biggest parts of college
to some coeds, and our plea is thisi
try to see how earnestly many, many
women have wanted the chance to
try to make varsity teams, and real»
ize that many of them have had
enough experience in sports to base
their arguments on some experience
and truth,

Very truly yours.
Helen McLeran and
Kate Coggeshall.

Large Team From Grinnell
Entered in Drake Relays;
Strong in Distance Events

Ofﬁcial entries for the Drake Re-
lays next Saturday. have been sent
in by Coach Lester Duke, Grinnell
track mentor. A large squad wrll
represent the Pioneers at Des Moines
with most of the scoring strength in
the distance events.

Although individual entries are
not yet deﬁnite, it is fairly certain
that Pilbrow and possibly secor will
be in the two mile run. The mile re»
lay team will be composed of the
usual men, Fojman, H. Edwards,
Murphy. and Hensley. with a chance
that Thomas will run in place of
Edwards.

McIlrath and Pilbmw will see her
tion in the medley relay, and Kukoe
lich will be putting the shot. The
dashes will have Alexander and Paj-
man, while Douglas will he in the
high jump.
