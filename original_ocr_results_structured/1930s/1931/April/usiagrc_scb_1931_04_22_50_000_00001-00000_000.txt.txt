Satisﬁactory, Poor, Failure for New Class

System t° Get Tr'al Students at Grinnell college are

busy these days pickling ﬁsh worms.

No, their purpose is not that of
preparation for the opening of the
ﬁshing season. It is, rather, a dual
purpose; to save money for the col-
lege and to see that next year's fresh-
men get at least two worms each, so
that they may study certain biologic-
al facts, and discover just how high
in the animal scale the earthworm
crawls.

in September

A new system of grading which
includes only tlle classifications of
“satisfactory,” “pour." a ll d
“failure,” instead‘ of the present
marks of A, B, C, D, and E, was
adopted at 8. meeting of the Grill-
nell college faculty Monday aft-
ernoon.

Although the system is subject
to change or annulment. as plain,

ulty members, tllis plan has been
adoptedlto meet the increasing de-
mands of the student body for a

stem under which more atten-
tlon will be paid to actual value
of the course rather than the
grade given.

Grade List Continues

Grade points will be counted in the
same manner as before and will be
made public to the students at reg-
ular intervals. The grade list for
those making 60 points during the
year, and the list of "Grinnell schol-
ars," including those getting so points
or more, will continue to he sent out

Another reason given for the
change is that, “it is hoped that any
barriers which may exist between
the students and faculty because of
grades will be broken down under
this plan."

Discussed on Campus

The new system is not prevalent
among American colleges, although a
two—mark classiﬁcation has been
adopted by many European and Can-
adian institutions.

Proposed changes in the grading
system have been discussed by the
students on several occasions this
year. They were brought up at the
first sll»college assembly on exam»
inations and served as a topic for
the intramural debates in the quad-
rangle.

Save Money for College

This year‘s biology class decided to
save the college that money by
pickling the worms here at home. So,
during a warm spring rain the other
night, the members donned overshoes
and ﬂashlights and splashed through
the soggy turf for an hour. Net re
sult, 500 worms, all nicely cleaned
and washed.

The pickling process might cause
many American citizens to envy the
worms, for they are bathed in a so
per cent solution of pure grain alcoe
hol, from which they never recover.
Next they are soaked in a formalder
hyde bath and then tucked neatly
'and carefully away in glass jars,

Like String Beans

They cannot be tumbled in like
their fellows who go into the small
boy's bait can, but must be laid out
in straight rows. In fact, when the
job is done it looks very much as if
someone had been putting up aspara—
gus tips or string beans.

The angle worm is important in the
study of biology, for it represents a
distinct step in the development of
animal life. It is higher in the social
scale than the hydra but lower than
the crayﬁsh, It is the ﬁrst of the tri-
poblastic forms of life, which means
that it has a body composed of three
layers of cells instead of two.

Find Lengthy Crawler

The lower forms have only two
layers, one gurnishing the outside or
skin, the other making the digestive
tract. The earthworms third, or mid-
dle layer of cells corresponds to the

(Special to The Scarlet and Black)

DES MOINEsiEvery school in the
Missouri Valley conference will be
represented in the twenty—second an-
nual Drake relays here Friday and
Saturday.

Drake, the host, and Grinneil, the
other Iowa member of the loop, have
each ﬁled entry for 18 athletes.
Creighton will send eight from Oma—
ha while the Oklahoma Aggies have
nominated a seven-man team. Wash-
ington’s only entry is Timberlake, the
brondq’umper who won third place
last year.

Glass a Favorite

Peyton class. the sophomore sen-
sation from Oklahoma Agricultural
and Mechanical college, is one of the
favorites in the IOU-yard dash. Capt,
Jenkins, ranking distance ace of the
valley, is doped to ﬁnish high in the
American championship two-mile run,

Lansrlld and Collins, Drake’s pair
of pole valuting experts, are among
the favorites in. the sky»grazing con-
test. The Bulldogs also boast a strong
weight combination, with Blanck in
the shot put and Harlan in the discus.
The latter won his specialty recently
at the Texas relays. Drake’s two-
mile relay team, composed of van
Lanlngham, Gordon, Hyland and
Mooneyham, has a chance of placing
in that race.

McIlrach, PilbI-ow Threats

Capt. McIlrath and Pilbrow are
Grinnelrs chief threats, the Pioneers
being among the leading distance
men. Grinnell also has the versatile
Ben Douglas who may win points in
the high jump. The scarlet and black
distance medley relay quartet, which
placed at Illinois, is a possible con~
tender for honors.

Rain Halts Track Meet

The dual practice track meet bee
tween Iowa state college and Grin—

canceled as a result of inclement
weather. The meet was originally
scheduled for Monday afternoon, but

As a result of the cancellation of
the meet, many of the Pioneer run—

Annual Spring Festival by W. A. A.
May 1 in High School Auditorium

The ofﬁces of Hand gymnasium are
taking on the appearance of n cos-
tumer‘s shop as preparations are be-
ing made for the annual spring festi~
Val to be given under the direction of
Miss Clara J. Anderson Friday, May
I, at 3:15 p.m. in the high school!
auditorium.

Fifty women from the dancing
classes in the physical education de—
partment will take part in the testis
val which is of special interest be-
cause it is composed chieﬂy of orig-
inal work created for class projects.
The feature of the program is a fan-
tasy, "The statue of Beauty", written
by Helen Kingery and adopted for
festival use by Miriam McNally, '30,
for the class in pageantry.

In addition to these numbers each
cottage will be represented by one
group in original dances prepared
for the intramural contest in creative ‘

dancing. ‘

There will be ducts and a solo by
Cecil Panor and many group num-
bers will be given in clog, character,
and Greek natural dancing. The cos—
tumes and setting are in charge of
the class in pageantry and festivals.

The festival is being given indoors
this year to avoid a gamble with the
weather, according to Miss Andersen.
The type of program being given,
however, lends itself easily to an in-
door stage since special lighting ef—
fects and scenery are being used.

The fete has been a traditional an-
nual event at Grinnell for the
last 20 years. An effort has
been made to vary the type of
program each year. Last year an
old English festival was presented on
the campus; in 1929 a general crea-
tive program was given in the high
school auditorium, and in 1523 the
story of Sleeping Beauty was enacted
at the Colonial theater.

John S. Nollen, dean of tho
Griluleil college faculty, was
named acting president of the in;
stitutiou at u meeting of the board
of trustees Monthly. He succeeds
President .1. H. T. Main who died
April 1.
