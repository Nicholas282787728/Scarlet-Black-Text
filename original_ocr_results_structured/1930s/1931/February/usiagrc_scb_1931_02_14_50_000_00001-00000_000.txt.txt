Creighton University Head
Dies Friday After Illness

The Rev. William H. Agnew, 49,
president of Creighton university,
died at st. Mary's hospital, Roches—
ter, Minn, yesterday after a two-year
illness of intestinal cancer.

Born in Westphalia, Kan, Oct. 12,
1881, of Irish immigrant parents,
Eatber Agnew became recognized as
one of the country's leading educa—
tional executives.

Washington.

Employment ‘Tips

At the present time there is one
teacher in training for every two
teaching positions in the United
States, and within four years there
will be two teachers in. training
for every three positions. This
helps to explain why teaching is
so greatly over-crowded.

Students who have little apti—
tude or interest in teaching should
not. plan to teach because It is the
easiest thing to do. They will ﬁnd
it very difficult to secure a posi.
tion.

Hoodoo for Baskeleer

MILWAUKEE —— Far be it from
Coach Chandler of the Marquette uni-

in the romantic affairs of his caging
athletes, but Chandler has a problem
and may write his congressman.

The girl friend of one of his star
athletes insists on seating herself in
the bleachers directly beneath the
west basket at all home games. As
a consequcnce, the athlete is flustrat-
ed and rarely makes a free throw in
that hoop.

Something ought to be done about
this! '

"Science Unites

With Religion,’ 1
Declares Wardi

Final Gates Lecture Given;

Fellowship Meeting
Ends Friday

That science, in the coming new
religion, will no longer be apart from
religion and philosophy was the main
point in the concluding Gates Memor-
ial lecture by Harry F. Ward, pro.
fessor of Christian ethics at the
Union Theological seminary, New
York City, yesterday morning in
Herrick chapel.

Mr. Ward delivered five addresses
this week on the general topic, “The
demand of contemporary civilization
upon religion." He spoke Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday at
9:40 am, and also at 8 pm. Thurs-
day.

In continuing his talk yesterday,
Professor Ward said, "Science will
cease to be a barrier in the pursuit
and obtainment of an ethical relig.
ion.”

Scicnce to supplant Priest

The speaker explained that in the
past the priest has been the inter-
mediary between religion and the
people, but now it is he who has in.
terpreted and explained the intiinc
ties of their objects of worshi .
Science will supplant the priest, and
thus science will clarify the myster-
ies and indnities of religion for the
people.

“The metaphysics of past personal-
ities have tried to separate ethics
and order,” Mr. Ward declared. “Mr.
Einstein has said that science makes
us have an orderly universe, and that
religion
mechanism." Professor Ward, how.
ever, stressed the point that religion
is necessary, as ethics and order go

Not Interested in Women

"Johnny is 6 feet 31/, inches tall,"
Miss price said. “He has brown eyes
and curly hair, and isn't much inter—

John Price seems to have been a
normal boy, interested in scouting
and digging trenches in the back
yard. He captained the Northwestern
Military academy football and bas-
ketball teams during his last year at
prep school.

Pioneers Hold
‘ Margin, 15' to 7
at End of Half

Humphrey, McCreary Leave
Valley Tilt on Fouls;

Locals Tire

. By ED GAINIENNE
(Special to The Scarlet and Black)

S’l‘. LOU 7\Vns]\lvlglon uni-
vOl'olll S llaslictllnll team went. in-
lo undisputed load ol' the )I souri
Valley conference liﬂl‘c la, night,
when it rallied lute ill the game
to defeat Gl‘illllell college, 26 to
25. The Pioneers held the lead
during; the contest, and outplayed
\l'zi'llillglon until the last five
minutes.

Grinnell lost the services of Hum-
phrey and McCreary on personal
fouls at this stage of the contest, and
the Bear's first string went on a
scoring rampage. The Washington
victory was chiefly due to the fact
that. Coach Dan White had replaced
most of his first Squad by substitu-
tion until the last, when the
Grimellians began to tire from their
fast abtack.

Douglas starts Scoring

The game started slowly, both
teams fumbling passes and missing
the basket when they did get a
chance to shoot. Not a point was
counted for five minutes, when
Douglas opened the scoring with a
free throw and Humphrey followed
with a field goal.

The smooth Grinuell offense began
to function at this point, and the
Washington men were not fast
enough to stop it. At the half the
Finneers held a 1577 lead. Since the
scarlet and black was outplaying the
local aggregation, it appeared to have
the game in the bag at halftime.

Pioneers Crippled

The second half opened with both
teams guarding closely, numerous
fouls resulting. Constance, Wise, and
I-Iohn were kept from play most of
the period until, with only five min-
utes to go, they went in and started
their attack.

Grinnell players were tired and be-
gan to foul in their guarding. With
Humphrey and McCreary out of the
game. the Iowans were materially
crippled and the Bears ran up a three.
point lead. Duncan shot a field goal,
but the battle ended a few seconds
later as the referee called or held ball.
