CUTTING CLASSES, CUTTING GRADES

There is a practice in vogue on the campus
with many of the professors that has long seomcd
unfair. It is the custom of reducing grades, earned
on the basis of papers turned in and examinations
taken. because the student has cut, in the estima-
tion of the professor, too many classes.

This seems unfair, since the same cuts for
which this deduction is made are turned in to the
registrar’s office and here again, if they cxcccd o.
certain number each semester, the student is penal:
izcd by losing an hour of credit. Thus he is penal-
ized twice for the same offense, if it may be so
called.

All students do not work in the Sallie manner,
so it seems rather unfair to insist that they all copy
form to the same standards, and more unfair yet to
punish [ham twice for the same deviation from this
standard.

At times it appears that it is the Wound to
the professor 5 Vanity inflicted by cutting his
classes for which the grade is reduced, and this
is quitc possible for professors are as human as
the rest. It is the spirit of fair play in the faculty
that must be appealed to, because in the last
analy is grading is a thing that cannot be forced
according to' a set rule.

It is hoped that the faculty will express its atti~
tudc ill the matter and thus help to clear up the
situation.

SPIRITUAL REJUVENATION!

Grinnell’s victory bell has pealed its message
to townspeople twice recently, once after the Pio-
necr basketball game with Drake and again when
the local team trounced the Marquette ﬁve. There
Wasn’t a lot of»ringing either time, but it was
enough to carry word of the victory to those who
heard it.

The spirit of the fans has shown a remarkable
rejuvenation recently, and perhaps the ringing of
the bell is related to that, The last two home c ,
tilts were marked by a running ﬁre of cheers from
the sidelines. Whether this increase in student slip:
port helped toward victory, or whether the victor:
ions team increased the noise on the part of the
fans, is problcmatieal, but whichever way it oper-
atts, commendation is in order.

Whoever rang the bell after the Marquette vic«
(my was so enthusiastic that he pulled tho licll
liver, and it was necessary to turn it back before
it could be sounded for chapel the following morn-
ill . Strangely, administrative ofﬁcials found lloillr
ing in this over which to bccolnc aroused. Some, in
fact, commended a student attitude which showed
such cllthusiasm,

Grinllell has completed its home basketball
schedule and has one game remaining, Creighton
at Omaha. The Pioneer cogcrs have never def d
the Blucjoys, although they came within a point
of turning the trick last year.

Creighton caught Grinncll in a slump in the
ﬁrst game this year to take a decision hero. Coach
Jchn Trncsdalc has a team that is capable of talc
illg the Omaha gamc. Will the student body he
backing it when it leavts for the Nebraska floor?
Why not show it at the train when the men depart”:

INVENTORY YIELDS ENCOURAGENENT

Replacement of cars, Tlll'lliturc, radios, \Vfll'd-
robes. etc, will increase production during the next
12 months, in the belief of 13.0. Forbes, business
consultant, who is the author of an article in the
Feb. 15 issue of Forbes magazine.

Were an inventory taken of American homes,
stores, warehouses, and factories, it would be found
that rcscrvc supplies have been enormously dc-
plcted since the l929 boom collapsed. In homes

,whcre replacement is needed, Mr. Forbes says that
they have put an additional billion dollars in sav-

‘I‘HE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

and thrift accounts.

All this means that production during the last
year or more has been kept rigidly below sales and
actual consumption. It means that surpll have
given place to something approaching .Walcity. It
means, further, that there has been Slowly but
surely uluulllliug a pent-up demand. a demand
which cullllot in the nature of things be withheld
luuch longrr.

;\ broad VlPW of the situation justiﬁes a ra-
tional amount of optimism rather than pcs imisul.
Nothing has happcnrd to disprovc the theory that
the depression reached bottom ill December, ac-
cording to Mr. Forbes.

Caution will rule until congress adjourns, for
ﬁnancial and business leaders—most men responsi-
blo for the ﬁlling of large numbers of pay cllvclopcs
kculllloi take an entirely calm view of the political
lineup at Washington. Should, urillappily, a special
session be forced upon the nation. the effect would
be disturbing,

In conclusion, Mr, Forbes dcclarcs: “The spate
of January failures was expected; it probably rep—
resents the culminating upheaval of post-panic
wreckage. From now on the trend, accompanied by
innumerable eddies, is expected to be ill the main
forward.

THESE BERSERK EDITORS
(From the Oklahoma A. and M. Daily O‘Collcgiml)

One of our contemporaries. the editor of a west
coast daily college publication, has been suspended for
commenting too energetically upon politics vitally af-
fecting that institution.

“18 do not doubt that the function of a college
paper is to conﬁne its views largely to those purely
local, but we must sympathize with the editor who
found the shortest way out by emitting a statement
ot beliet.

Decidedly a college newspaper should not take the
state government to task as a rule—for as a matter of
fact too many editors of this nature are just dam fool
boys with aspirations towards astounding the Worm
with their knowledge. In this case, though, the editor
merely announced opposition to a legislative measure for
limiting attendance at the university.

We feel that he was justiﬁed in bringing the matter
betore the student body and in expressing what opin-
ions he might have harbored concerning the matter,
but unfortunately for him these ‘Lhings never work out
according to theory. and it is quite common for a ram»
pant editor to be suspended now and then.

It is really an interesting reﬂection to note that
college editors gc regularly on editorial sprees, The
most conservative will burst forth in spasmodic glory
at intervals, and will then abate as if somewhat abasned
by their own boldness. Our outbursts in an impassioned
plea for Sunday movies shows that.

We do not feel that the editorial reﬂection of any
college newspaper need be taken as seriously as some
imagine. We are quite Sure that. the legislature Will not
call a wrathful special session to punish the college for
the acts of an indiscreet editor.

However, lest our motive for uttering these few
words be misunderstood, let us hasten to assure the
legislature that we are not contemplating any attack
of any nature whatsoever. We are well satisﬁed with
anything and everything.

WISCONSIN INTERLUDE
(From the Harvard Crimson)

There have been many educational ventures in re-
cent years attempting to adapt the modern university
to the needs of the present day. Such a venture is the
Experimental college at the University of Wisconsin,
which Prof. Alexander Meikleiohn has recommended he
closed in 1932 in order to conduct a survey of the results
attained during its five years of experimental existence.

The Experimental college was founded with the pur-
pose of developing “an understanding of the human mind
as it creates and fashions the civilization in the midstl
of which men live." students studied two civilizations,
treating them troni every point of view in an aotempt
to realize this difﬁcult idea. This attempt at universality,
although noble in am. is open to all the dangers of
superficiality. By trying to solve the "eternal problems
which confront us all." class and administrative re-
strictions have been broken down and the emphasis
placed on the close relations of tutor and tutee.

With this extremely mature thesis and the decided
trend toward individual liberty, the question as to
whether freshmen and sophomores are sufﬁciently com-
petent really to beneﬁt by this method of education is
a dubious one. Mr. Meiklejohn, however, considers the
time ripe for an evaluation of his experiment, and the
results whether favorable or unfavorable, can not fail
to he of help in the task of creating a balanced uni-
versity adapted to the needs of modern life,
