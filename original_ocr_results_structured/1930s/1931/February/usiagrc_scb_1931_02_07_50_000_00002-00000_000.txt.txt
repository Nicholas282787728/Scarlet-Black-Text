SPRING MUSICAL PRODUCTION

In the height of the ollcract play season, which
is now ill progress ill the drama department, it is
but natural to wonder what the spring offering of
tllc National Collegiate Players will be. No doubt
it will too equal ill the perfection of production
and ill the novelty of the sclcction to its prcdc-
cessors, “Emperor Jones” and “Windows.”

An interesting contribution to novelty would
be a musical production. Grillnell’s glee clubs and
orchestra are fully capable of performing up to
Mrs. Sara Sherman Pryor ‘5 standards ; rind although
there are no really operatic voices among the
student body. there are some well-trained ones
which arc capable of filling the Colonial theater,
for instance.

The “theatrical arrangements of the women’s
glee club concert last year, and the men’s cxccur
tion of “The Sunset Trail” were sufficient to sug-
gest what dramatic effects the Grinllell singers are
capable of.

There is no lack of proper lllusical material,
Compositions ranging from “Aida” to “Pinafore,”
from “Student Prince” to “Show Boat” have been
written and played.

If not tlli vcar, than at some future tilllc it
would bc interesting to see the dramatists turn
their hzlnd to a musical production.

ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHING

There is still hope for the college woman. It:
will be welcome news to many women students of
today, who are worrying about their future posi-
tions, to know that there is agood ﬁcld of work
open to them. That field is the opportunity for
teaching in elementary schools.

Hel‘ctoforc college women have obtained their
bachelor of arts degrees and gone out to teach in
high schools, whether that was where they could
do their best or not. They believed that their places
were in secondary schools, and that their wages
would be higher there than ill other schools, be-
cause college-trained women were ill demand as
high school instructors.

However, it is no longer necessary for college
women to keep seeking positions in the over
crowded field of high school teaching. Mitchell
Drcesc, director of personnel at Grimlcll college,
reports that out of a total of 362 calls for teachers
which he received last year, 98 were for elementary
school tcachcrs. What do these figui'cs infill"! Tllcy
mean that collcgc women are ill demand for such
positions, and that school. boards and superintclldr
cuts are l'cali 'lg that it is just as important to
have cxccllcntly prepared tcachc ' in the gl‘adcs
as in the high Schools.

In addition to the realization by the public of
tllc importance of the collcge-tl‘ciued woman ill
elementary chools, there is grou mg the realization
on thc part of teachers thcmsclvcs that some
women are llettcl- suited to work with young chile
dl‘cn than with ll and girls of high , hool age.
And with rccoglli on of those two for s ha come
the tendency to put wages of the clcmcutarl llool
teachcr on a par with tlloso of ii tl-uctol ill scce
olldai'y schools, tllol-oby equalizing the financial
opportunities ill tItC two fields. _ ,

As COI‘IOI'CIO proof of this fccllug concerning
teachers, there has been introduced into the Iowa
legislature a bill which would establish two kinds
of certificates for elementary school teachers. The
lower type will bc the, customary permit to teach
after two years of college work. But the higher
type of certiﬁcate will require a B,A. dcgrcc with
foul: years of college study.

It is this latter type of certiﬁcate wlli ll would
enable students with a dcgrce from in, itutiolls
like Grinncll to enter the good ﬁeld of elementary
school teaching, and still to demand the wagcs
which they really require as adequatc returns on
thc investment of four years at college. Thc bill has
the earliest support of many educators in tllc slate,
and there is every liklihood that it will be passed.

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Ill the face of such positil'c proofs of the op-
portunities now offering themselves to tcachcrs
ill clcllwlltilry schools, it bchoov llc young women
of Grillllell seriously to consider t‘ntcl‘lllg‘ this
ﬁeld. The importance of the elemental school
teacher ill the, educational system is bcin rcalizcd,
and Mr wages are even now at l ctivc level.
If a woman i ittcd for the task 'ol'ahly
inclined to it, there is no reason why she cannot
be a success ill this ﬁeld, for there is every oppor-
tunity open to her.

UNI'I‘Y THROUGH CONVOCATION

Durino the World \Vlﬂl' Grinncll college faced
u crisis 'lmilzll' in many respects to the present
problem. At that time the fllll epidemic was swccp-
illg the country, and in order to escape the gcrm
as long as possible. the students and faculty passed
r’l rule that provided absolute isolation of the col-
lege.

Every student and every faculty member cor
operated. The dormitories were already under
military discipline; at the quadrangle all illtcr-
course‘ with the down town was Cﬂl“ie(I on by the
dean of women. The flu (lid collie ill, but not lllltil
a good hospital system had been established.

TIIE‘ present crisis is more subtle. For several
ycars the college has tended to become less uniﬁed.
Perhaps it is the new trend in education as ill mu-
terial production; wholesale education may be
taking the placc of the small college. Certain Grin-
llelliuils will never admit, that, and it is those who
planned the convocation service llondny morning.

Whether convocation ill itself will bring the
college together again is oxtrclncly doubtful, but
it is evident lhat it will be valuable as a stimulus
for concrete action, and us a suggestion of how
the, problem may he "let. Ill its own right the
service is a dctiuitc addition to the campus, whether
or not it secures the return of unity ill Gl’illllell.

INTERCOLLEGIATE DEBATING
(By Prof. LP. Ryan, head of the department of
speech at Grinnell college and former president of
the Alllcricarr Association of Teachers of Speech.
From the 1931 drirmell Debnto program)

It has been observed that the leaders of today
were the debaters of yesterday. Those who, in their
intercollegiate careers, argued and discussed the ques—
tions of practical importance have become foremost in
politics, in business, and in the professions. Consequent»
ly, dens/ting is a preparation for public life.

The aim of intercollegiate debating is not that of
winning decisions. although such a feature has its place.
It is rather for the purpose of gaining training and min
perience in the organization and presentation of evi-
dence. Its value lies in the development of logical
analysis, clear thinking, cogent reasoning, pleasing de-
livery, and convincing appeal; as yet, no substitute has
been found in which these qualities are combined to
such a striking degree.

In addition, there is the social viewpoint. ft is from
the discussion and analysis of matters of the tiny that
an informed and intelligent public opinion is developed.
From a faithful presentation of both sides of a question,
the members of the audience gain an understanding
which is reﬂected in their actions as citizens.

PROFESSOR NORRIS
(From the Dos Moincs Register)

It is customary for colleges to obtain their com—
mencement speakers from a distance, but in June the
graduating class of Grinnell will listen to all address by
one of its own teachers, Prof. Harry Waldo Norris, head
of the department of zoology.

The Grinnell action in naming Mr. Norris as com-
mencement speaker is appropriate both because it as-
sures the graduates of an address worth listening to,
and because it gives honor to a prophet on his own
campus.

By no means does Professor Norris' claim to honor
rest upon the mere fact that Within a few months he
will have completed 40 years of continuous service on
the Grinnell faculty. His research work in anatomy has
won him recugni 'un on both sides of the Atlantic. More
than that, his interests and activities ousi'dc his pro-
fessional field have made him one of he most outstand-
ing men who ever taught at Grim-tell,

He has carried out consistently a philosophy of life
which he thus expresses in port: “We must abandon
the obsession that life is a. conglomeration of water tight
compartments, in which are enclosed discrete entities
such as mind, soul, intellect, emotions, sensibilities. will.
The rcal explanation of the uniqueness of life comes
not by anaysis of dissection, but from recognition of
the me some governance of the whole. the unity, the
integrity of the living organism.”

Mr. Norris has been respected by his colleagues nlnl
his students alike for his intellectual honesty/7a (1‘)“;
in which many educators are found lackingranvl on
Occasion he has shown the courage and the candor of a
Jeremiah. He merits the honor which Grinnell is giving
him,

Campus Opinion

no you thinlr there is a deﬁnite
need for ocdneiolull general college
assemblies ?

Frank .l-Icriel: Yes, it is only
through such a medium that campus
problems can adequately be discussed.

Kate Hobart; It is a good way in
which to gain the cooperation and
backing of the student body.

Marlon Johnson: The assemblies
will bring not only a more cooperative
feeling between Students, but between
students and faculty regarding camr
pus problems.

Prof. E. D. Strong: They are very
desirable in general. and will be in
particular if effectively organized
and related to the vital problems of
the whole college community. 'They
should be conducted without too
much solemnity.

Alvin Burrmau: Yes. a relation of
students and faculty is part of our
college system. General assemblies
increase a friendly relation which is
beneﬁcial to the students, faculty,
and college.

Walter Senor: General college as-
semblies are one way of bringing
necessary college unity to the fore-
front in a student’s mind.

not L. o. Douglass: Yes, I favor
the plan of all-college assemblies. It
the subjects to be discussed can be
of common interest to all the college,
the assemblies should be of value to
all of us individually, and to the col-
lege as a whole. ,

Weekly Plays to Provide
Drama Students Training
During Second Semester

Two one-act plays. “The Finger of
God" by Percival Wilde and “The
Lost Silk Hat” by Lord Dunsany,
given in the auditorium by members
of the play production class, began
a series of one-sot plays that are
to be presented weekly throughout
the second semester.

This provides n training school for
members of production classes, as
well as experience for students in-
terested in acting. Elementary class-
es hove charge of directing most of
these plays.

”Folly with a Past,” by George
Middleton and Guy Bolton, will be
presented late this month in addition
to the schedule of one-acts. Mem-
bers of advanced production classes
will assist Mrs. Sara Sherman Pryor
in the direction.
