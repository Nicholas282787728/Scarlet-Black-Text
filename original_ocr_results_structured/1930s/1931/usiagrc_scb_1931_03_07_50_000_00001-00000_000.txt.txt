Economic Aid
of Communism

Professor Believes Religion,

Business Reconcilable
in Talk to Men

uCommunism does not give the
right respect for the personality," as-
serted J. P. Ryan, professor of
speech. in addressing the men of
Grinnell college at the regular Young
Men's Christian association meeting
in the dormitory dining .room Thurse
day evening. “It may eliminate pover-
ty, but it also will eliminate personal-
ity and individualism!"

Professor Ryan’s address was, in
some measure, a retaliation against
a number of the talks heard here this
year in which the speakers attacked
the present economic system of the
United States. He attempted to
show the relationship and non-antag-
onism of religion and business.

Ignorm Antagonism

Harry F. Ward, Gates Memorial
lecturer this year, contended that
religion either proves it elf able to
redeem the present civilization from
the blind selling and making of
things, or blindly leads it into the
twilight of other civilizations.

Rather than attack the points
brought out in the Gates lectures, or
to build another case denying Mr.
Ward's theory, the speaker Thursday
chose to ignore' antagonism and
attempt a reconciliation.

Religion Indi idual

Professor Ryan pointed out that
religion is primarily individual, and
not a social activity. “We cannot
see anything in religion but this in-
dividual and personal motive,” he
remarked. “There is nothing that is
not religious."

“Business," he continued, “is pri—
marily cooperative and is built on
the principle of mutual service. All
of salesmanship is built on the idea
that the salesman reveals to his pros-
pect his deepest wants and needs and
shows him how to fill ﬂiem ..

Need Integrating Principle

"The college man having the intel-
ligent, integrating ideal may unite
the two to serve others and profit
himself. This is bound to give all
mankind more comfort and conven-
ience, and ultimately will eliminate
poverty and bring the time when
business will become automatic."

A reading by Homer Pitcher, and
two vocal selections by Fred onl, ac-
companied by Edward Shadbolt; com-
pleted the program.

Two coeds of the New Jersey Col-
lege for Women were suspended for
being caught in a raid on a speak—
easy.

By ALFRED CONAItD

A terrible snake, a boa, is on the
Grinnell college campus. It is be»
hind walls and bars and hound vole
umcs of zoological abstracts, which
not even a snake can get through.

“He got so ugly last night, hissing
and breaking off his teeth at me!”
Prof. H. W. Norris, head of the
zoology department, told the excited
reporter, “that I didn't want to see
him. I turned his face to the wall,”

Yum, Yum! Human Flesh:

The cage was carefully turned
around for the benefit of the press
representative. The reptile was lying
in a torpor, like the constrictor

swallowed the donkey. When a
