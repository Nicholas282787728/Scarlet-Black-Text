CONTINUE IN COLLEGE
. Grillncll college seniors, and. in fact, the soil-
lors of nearly flll colleges this ,vear have found that
they could scarcely have found a le s favorable
tiiiie to market their sc‘ lees, The supply at gratlllr
ation time often exceeds the demand. but it s sel-
dom by the large margin that is found tllis year.
\Vitll this condition 0 ting, many graduates are
accepting positions beneath that level for which
' their training has ﬁtted them. Their polls)Y is based
on the theory that ii poor job is better than having
none.

The academic year of 1.031 s will probably
prove to be the best time for those men mid \vOnr
on to add to their intellectual abilities through
graduate study. This means that ﬁllan in] support
must be obtained, of course, but eventually it,
should prove a material gain to the graduate. By
Starting in another ﬁeld than that for which he is
trained, the graduate not only has to start at the
bottom but. ll? is likely to lost! through lack of
practice a part of that ability which in college
work lilis given him. Eventually it may ulcnli the
death of the career he has planned.

If students are able to tide over the dopr ‘oli,
either through their ouui money or by borrowing.
they will probably ﬁnd it worth while when do-
lnalld for men and women increases ill the future.
Their added training will make tllelli ﬁrst choice
employes at that time and with this added help ill
a period of prosperity the payment of debts ill-
curred now should not be difﬁcult Theoretically
Such a policy seems practical and it ' being recom-
mended in many quarters,

IOWA TAKEN IN

Two Iowa institutions, Griiiliell college and
Drake university were mercilessly taken into camp
at Chicago last ii'cekend. Both schools, with llleil
entered in the finals of the Central Intercollegiate
tennis tournament, \ re forced to default through
a misunderstanding iii the time of those last lllrltcll-
es.

The affair was probably just an unfortunate
occurallcc bllt becomes particularlv lammitahlo
when one considers that Tatom had defeated last
year's ('llillllplOl] ill the semi-ﬁnal round and hild
certainly earned a chance ~to play ill the ﬁnals,
There were a large number of spectators wllo
thought the ﬁnal. were iii the afternoon also liitd
were on hand only to see Tatum of Grinncll and
Brody and Jensen of Drake receive l'llllllL‘l‘»ll[J
aivmds.

Had this error been made in the case of only
one main one could easily blame him rather than
any of the. ofﬁi'als. \Vith defaults in both ﬁnals,
however. the error seems to be on the part of those
in charge of the meet rather than those participah
ing. Notiﬁcation of the time of the ﬁnal match
should certainly have been formed] given,

WORTH THINKING ABOUT
(From the lowu State Student)

one of the most discussed problems confronting
universities and colleges of today is the question of
house mothers in fraternities. This subject is becoming
one'of va'st importance at iowa State college. It is
often asked, what is the ultimate value of a house
mother?

There are a great many different ideas on this sub-
ject, but one characteristic is essential. A house mother
must be a woman old enough to have the understanding
and judgment of a mother upon young men of college
age. One of her biggest advantages is that she may act
as a social mentor for a fraternity chapter. Only such
work as any mother would do around her home is ex-
pected of her. She may be an advisor in the administra-
tion of the house and handle such things as the buying.
The right type of house mother should not assume the
role of teacherrgoverness in matters of discipline but
should be a mother to individual members as much as
circumstances permit.

A college club does not become Sissiﬁed by having
a house mother; neither is it a reﬂection upon its ability
to handle its own affairs A house mother cannot. help
but lend prestige to the fraternity. Several universities
have recognized the many beneﬁts derived and have
house mothers as a necessary factor in the schools'
fraternity systems Her presence stimulates a more
worthwhile goal in life among members who in turn tend
to shun the cheaper untidy things of life. Iowa State
fraternities would do well to consider the possibility of
engaging house‘ mothers before school starts next fall.

DEPRESSION AND THE. COLLEGE
(From the Marquette Tribune)

in more ways than one the current business de-
pression may prove a period of liquidation and readjust-
ment, for if it becomes as chronic as many economists
predict, there may soon be the neeessity of changing
college curricula and methods of instruction. Mas pro-
duction may be abandoned. at least temporarily, as it
may be abandoned in industry, but for a different rear»
son.

Whereas in industry the law of diminishing returns
has nearly always been respected and has always works
erl naturally, in education this has been true at few
schools. Since the war, with the exception of one or two
intervals. business activity has been so excessive that it
has been able to absorb even the remarkably large numr
ber of professional men trained in colleges. And as there
is always waste on the uptrend of the business cycle,
professional men have been employedkor have set up
for themselvesifor whom there was no real need, or
who otherwise were being paid more than they earne ,

they were either unnecessary or inefﬁcient, and they .

now have lost their positions in the retrenchment, In
other words, the professional school, like industry itself,

was palming' off inferior products during the excitement _

of prosperity.

If the Republicans succeed in chanting back their
particular brand of economic chaos, all will be well with
the school, but not if business reaches its equilibrium at
a point which does not permit waste. There .is little
point in being able to do something, which is the sole
beneﬁt of a professional school, if no one wants it done
or can afford to have it done; and this will be true all
the more if industry goes into an extended period of hi-
bernation.

STRICTLY A COLLEGE NEWSPAPER
(From the Coe College Cosmos)

The question is sometimes asked why The Cosmos
does not engage in publication of news matter from
outside the college ﬁeld, or why subjects other than
those related to the college are not discussed in its
editorial columns. The answer is that The Cosmos holds
that; this is not. the true function of a college weekly
student newspaper.

some college weeklies do print material other than
that which has its source within a college campus radius.
and in that policy lies the practical advantage of giving
to the staff practice in the writing and the handling of
general world news. But that is not the main function
of a college weekly. It exists to inform the student body
of what is news upon the college campus and to provide
leadership for the student body in its campus problems.
It is on campus matters that the editor of a college
paper can or should be able to speak with authority.
He cannot, on the other hand, hope to deal in a very
authentic way with great political problems or with
other outside topics with which his academic schedule
has made it impossible for him to keep in complete and
continuous Contact.

It is unnecessary for the college weekly. in order
to fulﬁll its real purpose, to repeat the outside news
which is state, national, or international in character,
for the students will learn about those things in the
dailies if they engage in any newspaper reading at all.

It is furthermore not going too far to say that from
the standpoint of the advertiser a college weekly which
devotes all of its space to strictly college news turnishes
a better advertising medium for reaching the college
reading public than either the eomercial daily or the
college paper which devotes a large perctenage of its
space to matters of an outside nature. The college
weekly with the college news has in it the element of
“local interest" and since it stays in the students’ po-
ssession for an entire week, it receives more thorough
reading than any other newspaper that enters the stu-
dent’s hands.
