Stirs Audience

Evidence of Training Seen
in Pitch, Enunciation,
Attack, Balance

By HUGO GOODWIN
(School of Music lnstrucml')

A wellsarranged program. presented
with dignity and charm stirred the
large audience to repeated outbursts
of enthusiastic applause, at the Men‘s
Glee club concert last evening in
Herrick chapel. The group was under
.the direction of David E. Peck, pro~
fessor of violin, in its thirty-seventh
annual appearance.

Painstaking and conscientious
training were evidenced in the perfeCA
tion of detail in every number. Steadie
ness of pitch, accuracy of attack.
smoothies of balance. and clarity of
e'nunciation all bore witness to than
ough drill. In every number. the
chorus evidently knew precisely where
it was going. and how to get there.

Emotional Expressiou

The program opened with Atten—
hoffer’s “Defiance." with an inciden-
tal solo well sung by Everett Curti
This number was well fitted to open
the concert. because of its wide
range of emotional expression.

Fred ohl followed with a solo
from Lisa Lehmann's “In a Persian
Garden.” The writer has heard this
number sung many times. but rarely
with more poetry and beauty than
at this time. An encore was insistent
ly demanded and graciously granted.

Enunciation Good

Two cappella numbers by the
chorus came next: "The Broken Mel-
ody." a touching number by Sibelili .
and ”When the Bird A-Pilferrng
Goes." a gay conceit by Kremscr.
Precision of attack and perfec .cn in
enunciation made them joys to hear.

Clark Bryan. violinist. played the
Andante from Lalo's colorful and
tricky Spanish Symphony. Mr. Bryan
plays with a luscious tone and fine
musicianship. As an encore he play-
ed an Elman arrangement of the
spiritual, "Deep River."

Curtis Interprets 1 Fine

An arrangement by Rvdcr of A.
Rosamond Johnson’s “Walk Tngetht‘l
Children," sung by the glee club was
delightfully camp-meetingisll. Its
naive expression of the negro’s child-
like religious rhapsodi ing was so
warmly applauded that an encore.
Sidney Homer's “Banjo Song.” with
the solo sung by Edward Shadbolt.
was given,

Everett Curtis sang “The Open
Road” by Roberts, and as an encore
Dobson’s “cargoes,” giving each of
them a. fine interpretation. Bullard-s
"Swords Out for Charlie”—vigorous
and red»blooded—-was sung in stirring
fashion by the club.

superlative Tochnlc

An interesting novelty was next
presented by Edward Shadbolt. a
"Nocturne" for left hand alone by the
Russian composer Scriabine. This is
a tour de force for a pianist and
showed that Mr. Shadbolt-s technic
is superaltive. An encore was the ir—
resistable “Ballet of the Chickens in
their Shells” by Moussorgsky.

The second half of the program
was given over to Prof. Elias Blum's
cantata. “On the Sunset Trail." This
work. frequently reviewed. well mer-
its the universal praise bestowed on
it. Cowboys. monks. prospectors. a

Faculty Votes to Cancel
Scholarships of Students
Having Cars on Campus

Grinncll college students who own
or operate automobiles will no longer
be eligible for college aid either
through scholarships or employment.
according to a ruling passed by the
scholarship committee of the faculty
Wednesday.

This move will enable the college
to aid more students really in need
of help. The ban on student owne‘l
cars was lifted last spring. average

grades and good conduct being the
only requirements for car operation

here throughout this year.

The ruling passed by the committee
says. “Any student who owns or has
part ownership in or operates a car
will thereby cancel his scholarship
aid and employment from the col-
legs."

Too Much leadership

Although America is at the bot

terest in good books for the last five
years. Miss Lowden thinks.

“There has been much talk at com-

“True leadership is the capacity to

Bell Raymond, Ollce

Tatom’s Student,

Plays Tutor on Court for First Time

"Tatom. Crinnell, defeated Bell
Raymond. Coe. 6-1, 10—3." Just are
other tennis match.

That is. one might think so if he
didn't know that John Tatom and
Carlos Bell Raymond are both grad—
uates of the Silliman intsitute. Du-
aguede. Philllplnes; that they were
both born in the town of Cebu. island
of Cebu. and that they played their
first match together last Thursday
on the Crinnell tennis courts.

Not only that. but it was a case of
a former instructor meeting and beat-
ing one of his former pupils. John is
three years older than Carlos and was
three years ahead of him in the acad-
emy and college of their native land.
They knew each other very well
though. and the experienced athlete
singled out the younger lad as a ten<
nis player well above the average.

"Why Play Kim"

”Did we ever play each other be-
fore in tennis?” repeated the good
looking young Filipino. “Why, no.
Johnnie was champion of the college
for seven years. Why should I play
him?”

Raymond is the son of a former
United states army officer who went
to the phillipines during the Spanish-
American war, married, and re-
mained there to practice medicine.
The youth came to America only a
year ago last August and is major—
ing in chemistry at Coe. He finishes
there this spring and plans to enter
medical school at the University of
Iowa next fall. At that time the two
schoolmates will probably be reunited
for Tatom plans to obtain his master's
degree there.

“They‘ll Believe It"

In 1925. John's last year at the
Silliman school, Tatum was number
one man on the tennis team and Cars
los was in the number three berth.
Thcn in 1923 the younger player was
champion of the college. He was a
nircletter man. winning emblems in
track. soccer. and basketball as well
as tennis.

“Differences between the United
States and the Phillipiues? 0h. tell
them that at home we played tcnuis
with the monkeys. using coccaouts
for balls. They’ll believe it." And Car.
'10; grinned at his friend.

Hapgood Tells
of New System

Speaker Outlines Remedy

for Present Strife

in Factories

Misappropriation of purchasing
power. not overproduction, is the
cause of unemployment and business
depression. in the opinion of Powers
Hapgood of the Columbia Conserve
company. who spoke to Grinuell
groups yesterday under the auspices
of the Liberal club.

Mr. Hapgood. whose father is pres’
irleht of the Columbia Conserve com-
pany. a canning factory, told students
about the complete industrial democr
racy which is embodied in that com
ccrn its plan, he says. is such that
while the products can be sold at a
price lower than that of similar ch~
modities, and its workers are better
paid, it provides consistent profits of
from 15 to 30 per cent.

The management of the firm is en-
tirely within a council, which is made
up of every person employed in the
plant. This council. which meets
twice a week, sets salaries, elects ext
ecutives, discharges employes. con-
trols production. sales. finance. pro-
fit Mr. Hapgood said that the comp
pany has no set age. or numbcr of
years of employment. which a work»
man must have attained before he
can receive a pension. Neither is a
definite amount of money promised.
Workmen are pensioned when they
cannot work any longer, irrespective
of age.

”We have reached that system."
Mr. Hapgood concluded. n which
good things go from each in accor-
dance with his powers. to each in ac-
cordance with his need."

Frosh Lose by 73-52 Margin;
5 Records Shattered
in Varsity Meet

An inspired Grlunell c'ollege track
team. led by a consistent all-around
performer. Ben Douglas. and a Sta!»
wart quarter-miler. Dick Murphy.
came through with ﬂying colors to
upset the dope and down the Drake
Bulldogs 72 to 59 in a Missouri Valley
conference dual meet here yesterday
afternoon. Despite poor weather con-
ditions, ﬁve dual meet records were
tossed into the discard. three of them
by Crinnell men.

The record-breaking performance
of the Pioneer milecrelay team cli-
maxed one of the most thrilling meets
seen on the local track for some time.
Pojman was off to a good start. g'
ing Crinnell the lead, and Hugh Ed-
wards kept up the pace. A poor pass
lost ground. although Hensley re-
mained on the heels of Webb, dusky
Drake star.

Murphy's Sprint Wins

Taking the baton ﬁve yards behind
Van Lanningham. Missouri Valley
half-mile champion. Murphy refused
to allow the Bulldog flash to widen
the gap. it was Murphy's sprint that
forced the Drake man to give out
near the finish, and allow the Pioneers
to establish a new record of 3:26 5-10.
six seconds faster than the old mark.

Drake took an early lead in the
meet but the Pioneers pulled up and
led by one point. 59 to 53. with only
the broad jump and mile relay re~
maining. Not expected to place better
than third. in the broad jump. Doug-
las came through to take ﬁrst place
with a leap of 21 feet 8% inches.
making victory certain for the Plus
‘neers. since Alexander's best jump
was a half-inch short of Douglas'
mark.

Mcllrnth ltuns l-lalf

Captain Mcllrath turned in one of
the pluckiest performances of the day
to take second in the halfrmile. after
winning the mile run. He was boxed
on the ﬁrst turn and consequently
ran last for more than half of the
race. He came up fast only to be
boxed again at the head of the
straightaway. Not to be denied, he
uncorkcd a second sprint to ﬁnish sec—
ond to Van Lanningham,

Hensley defeated Captain Padre-
harac of the Bulldogs in the 220 yard
low hurdles. shattering the old meet
record of :25 by 2le of a second.
Pilbrow outdistanced the ﬁeld in the
two-mile run to break the old mark
by six seconds. Podrebarac of Drake
clipped a tenth of a second off the
record for the high hurdles, covering
the distance in :15 340.

Kukolioh Takes Discus

The other record was broken in the
polevault. when Collins of Drake
vaulted 12 feet 6 inches. six inches
higher than the mark set by Lansrud.
his teammate. in 1930. The Bulldogs
scored a slam in that event when
Lansrud and Johnson ﬁnished second
and third.

The Pioneers scored an unexpected
triumph in the javclin. Craﬂund. Mure
ray. and Douglas winning all three
places. Kuko‘llch also pulled an upset
when he tossed the discus l33 feet
