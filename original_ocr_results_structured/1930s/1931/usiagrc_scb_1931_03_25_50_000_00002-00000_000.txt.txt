THE WORLD WITHOUT

Too molly iulcl'ﬂsled critics of The Scarlet and
Blot ._ frankly disappointed in a hope. for sensu-
llolmllsm. have questioned editorial pol
lug lameness and all OI‘CI‘dOSC of caution. Theirs IS
The collllllc ilblc spirit of tho idealistic cl'usndcl‘
In It qucsl beltel-lllcnl and freedom. \Vllnt they
cannot realize ill their zeal is that the collcgc paper
elljo ml extensive exchange, and lllat their lilllo
world i brought into immediate Contact with the
world without, a “'Ol‘ld particularly cpl lit luis
collslvuclion.

Thus if a dormitory thief were apprehended

here. (he fl - instinct would be to urge immed-
iate publication of all fads and morals. If some
conﬂict bloke out between the administration and
student body. they would advocate a journalistic
battle to allay the evil. \V'ith commendable cour-
age these c .adcrs would leap into the breach
and defend it. Their error is that they think them-
selves universally understood becausc they under-
stand.
_ Actually, ill the case of the dormitory thief,
if the story were run, all local effect would be lost
in the false opinion formed of the college by only
Side readers. By the \ ,llcmellcc 0f the al'iicles.
these strangers would ,udgc that Grillllc—ll was be
set by a veritable epidemic of klcpt0mnuia. A coin-
plcte and biased report of the student attitude
toward some faculty stand would bland Gl‘innell
as a place of disscusions.

Idcalisls must remember that‘as members of
Gl‘inucll college they owe loyalty to the school.
and (hat the betrayal of a “house divided,” or the
ovcrcmphasis of such a situntiou, would injure
their Alma Mater.

The place for the popular crusade is not ill
the columns of the college press, but, in the com-
mltlec rooms and conference halls of (he campus
buildings. Crusaders or devotees of indifference,
Students always have lo keep in mind that they
play before all audience much larger than they had
suspected, composed of men zmd women who see
only actions and protestations, not those things
which incite them. When Grinllellians enter the
columns of The Seal-let and Black. they turn on
the footligllls for the world without.

EDUCATIONAL INQUISITION

At the City College of New York. Mflx W ’ .‘
president of the social problems club tll,
been S 'pcndcd for publishing fl bulletin called
”From, rs” in the course of El campaign against
compulsory military training, Another student, a
member of the club, was suspended for \I‘I ing to
the college paper ill protest against the adlnlnistlw
lion’s policy.

Such £1 policy of supl'cssioll might. be expcotvd
from The medieval church, or from all numeracy.
American education is founded on the principle
that all sides must be heard, and the truth will be
determined when all the facts are heard. There cm}
be no other justification for scculal' education,

Such action as that of the C. C. N, Y. admit "S-
trqtion puts all and to consideration of the merits
of compulsory military training, Ir, shows tho: the
partisans of thc sy cln, there, at least, are not
interested in considering the liner It identiﬁes
them with Nero and the Spanish inquisitioll ill
their methods of discovering the truth.

When educational il litntions adopt a policy
of obscuruntism. of preferring the darkness to the
light, they cease to be educational. They become
generators of ignorance.

CALIFORNIA GOES IOWAN
(From the Los Allgelcs Times)

“Who are Californians 7" snorted an orator, ”Some
are native sons and the rest are from Iowa,” shot back
an auditor,

Former Iowans to the number of 125,000 gathereu
in, Lincoln park recently. Any stater going among them
would insensibly come to the perception that they are
of the material out of which persisting nations anrl in-
stitutions are built.

The name. "Iowa." has been hurled as a sneer at
Southern California by the jealous of other sections.
Southern California could do worse. Iowans have clear
eyes and husky bodies. They are intelligent and strong.
They are wholesome and hearty. They come from the
very heart of the republic.

There are no bolsheviks among them. No commun-
ists were blatantly snorting treason against Uncle Sam.
No bewbiskered maniacs prating untried follies.

They are the yeomen out of which the doughboys
came. They are slow to light; but devastating in action.
They have courage to burn, and they are not afraid
to burn it, They are the material which Walls in the
liberties of the country.

They are the stock whence President Hoover sprang.
They are incorruptible. No Al Capones have come from
that state. They may “buy more land to raise more
com to fatten more hogs to make more money" to
come to Californi ; but they are welcome additions to
our population.

All hail Iowa:

TEACHING JOURNALISM
(-From the New York Times)

When Joseph Pulitzer provided in his will for the
school of journalism at Columbia university he spoke
of his profession as one “of unequaled importance for
its influence on the minds and morals of the people."
In the organization of the school Prof. John w, Cunliffe
aided the late Prof. Talcott Williams. and followed him
in maintaining the ideals set for it by Mr. Pulitzer‘s
desire "to attract to the profession young men of
character and ability,”

In choosing Carl W. Ackerman as Professor Cun-
liffe's successor the school has set before the students
and the profession evidence of its success. Mr. Ackerrnan
had his training in this school under those two masters
whom he succeeds, He had a sound college and univer-
sity training, and was one of the ﬁrst and ablest of the
graduates in journalism. This training and his varied
occupation since have equipped him to live up to Charles
A. Dana's definiticn of a well-trained newspaper man:

A journalist must be an allraround man. He must
know whether the theology of the parson is sound, whethr
er the physiology of the doctor is genuine, whether the
law of the lawyer is good law or ,not. His education,
accordingly, should be exceedingly extensive. If possible.
he should be sent to college, He must learn everything
the college has to teach; but what is more important,
he shoulrl be sent to the school of practical life and of
active and actual business. He must know a great many
things. and-the better he knows them the better he will
be in his profession. There is no chance for an ignore
amus.

Professor Cunliffe, who began his career in journal-
ism as a reporter and who came to his work with the
reputation of a scholar in letters, has rated instruction
in those fundamental subjects which enlarge the outlook
and ripen judgment above mere technical training. The

,one subject which he has kept in mind. as he once said,

waS to "help students to develop and use their own
personalities." Ti. is’a. good fortune for the school that
his counsel and advice are still to be at the command of
the faculty and those students who undertake advanced

Work.
