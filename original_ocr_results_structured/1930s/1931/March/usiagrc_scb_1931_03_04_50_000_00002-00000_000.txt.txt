A LOCAL AWAKENING

Enthusiasm throughout the entire student body

local fans were t‘dvol-ed with a real treat the next
evening. when the Pioneer lllcll sent the Hilltoppcrs

Flidzly evening between the halves of the Coc

QUALITIES 0F LEADERSHIP

With the elections for the women’s league
hoard, Young Women’s Christian association, lllld
~Women’s \thletic association president, llll’eﬂiillgr
1y near, an increasing amount of comment i‘ mon-
itcst. This interest is significant in tllzlt opinions
are being formed which will undoubtedly su llg
the election.

Certain points are sure to he raised iii any con-
versntioll about tllc mutter. One is, call the person
in question cooperate with the administration lllld
with other women? There have been too mull o -
ficcrs zlt 'ords-poiuts with the faculty and \ th
each other to warrant sl (li llissal of the point. This
raises the perennial question of “wire pulling,” but
long custom has dulled the force of the opposition.

Another frequent question asks whether a no
man should he clcctcd to an office which she docs
not desire. There might conceivably be grounds [or
refll ‘llg n position, if the woman de led to be c
candidate for another office, In ordinary circume
stances, aside from the sentimentality of exagger-
ated loyalty, the woman should accept the position
which the majority are confident that she can fill
best. There might, however, he circumstances when
accepting the offi is ollt of the question. from the
point of time or finance , and withdrawal on such
grounds would be unavoidable.

The Y. W. C. . . meeting tomorrow will he ll disr
cussion of the qualities that Should he posse ed by
a good leader, and the application to the impend-
ing clc iOH‘ 's understood. Some good ideas may
result, if individuals can draw their owll colic -tc
conclusions.

HARMFUL PHYSICAL EDUCATION

There is a Grillncll college requirement that
all men must have at least two years of physical
training to their credit before they can graduate.
The rule ill itself is a good one, and thc wise stu-
dent will see that this requirement is worked off
long before his senior year.

Occasionally there is a man who culo, lli
senior year without any physical education credits.
This may be due to several reasons, such as the
student transferring from an institution where
physical education was not required, interest in
other fields, or time consumed for various rczlsons.

COLLEGE SPIRIT? GONE
(From the Pill-sons Portfolio)

"Only 15 people, including the six speakers, two
coaches, and chairman, were present at the Iowa State
college debate last night, Crinnell spirit?"

That statement. in italic letters and enclosed in a
box, appeared at the beginning of a trout-page story
in The Gnnnell Scarlet and Black, Feb. 18.

Call it spirit or not, as you wish, it remains an in-
dication of the constant evolution in college life. It has
had its parallel in hundreds of other college. The day
of the literary society has passed into oblivion. Time
was when students crowded the rooms of those orgaulr
zations and relieved their pentrup emotions in heated
debates. Members of the groups went out of town and
to country churches and school houses to get in on the
argument.

Then came athletics. Ah, yes, football! By the
hundreds of thousands the athletes came. 0n the grid-
iron they hattered each others bodies to advance the
oval-shaped ball over a few yards of turf, on the basket-
ball court they tossed it through a hoop, some took to
the cinders and ran all manner of distances. jumped
over crossbars, and threw everything from sticks to
steel balls.

You say it’s all right? Then we won't argue. For
we get as much enjoyment out of exhibitions of athletic
skill as any ever did. And we do not deny the beneﬁts
derived. Ours is another point.

Last week the Portfolio took a “crack" at the
college song and pep at the games. Hardly a murmur
arose. The only reply is printed on this page. Well, then,
where is the Spirit? We dare say there isn’t any. It’s in
about the same place as the literary societies.

The new student is a. hardrboiled business executive.
He isn't entertaining many demands upon his time or
his enthusiasm. He is a cold matter-of-faot being; col-
lege has ceased to be an emotional proposition. He is
saying ”athletics for the athletes and the beneﬁts for
the same.” In the same way he is saying, "let them
win the games, the people in the stands cannot do it.”
He goes to see an exhibition and not to exercise his
lungs as did the literary society debaters of older days.
if he likes it, he will yell and ﬁling his arms anyhow;
if he doesn’t, he won't,

It is not only true in athletics, but is a. general ail-
ment. Where it will lead to is hard to determine. It may
lead to more academic and businesslike college life. But
a hurricane may be sighted at any moment and mm
ceed to turn the whole system into a whirl again.

WHAT EDITORIALS MEAN

(From the university of Detroit Varsity News)

Every week the Varsity News issues {our pages of
printed matter, amounting to exactly 32 columns, of
which two are devoted to editorials. These two columns
are of the greatest importance; yet some students make
it a point to skip them, to their personal disadvantage.

Editorials mean so much because they reﬂect. the
spirit of the student body. They set forth the time~
honored traditions of the school, the purpose and aim of
its activities, the ideals for which the university is
steadily striving. and the principles governing its actions.
A study of editorials will disclose the caliber of the stu-
dents and the standards they have attained.

A student may keep in close contact with the cam-
pus merely by reading these editorials. News articles
necessarily portray happenings in the cold light of fact;
but editorials are a ﬁnger on the pulse of the school,
and by a few words of comment can give a bit of news
added signiﬁcance, affording the student a fuller and
more correct picture of the whole.

Since this university is so large, the average stu—
dent is personally familiar with only a small portion
of the activities. Discussions of other activitias are
consequently valuable to him.

It is of paramount importance, therefore, for every
student who would be wholly educated and acquainted
with current events, that he read all such timely editor-
ials intelligently.

Originals by Swift, Lamb
to Have Presentation
in Two Weeks

Two original one-act plays, writ-
ten by Robert SWlft and Clifton
Lamb, members of the advanced
pleywriting class, are now being
cast and will be p sentetl to a critic
audience at a private showing within
two weeks.

“The Testimoniac,” a farce-comedy

dealing with common folk of the
streets, is written by Mr. Swift,
The action takes place in a down
town park. Mr. Lamb has written
a serious drama, “Reachin' {0' tie
Sun," which has its scene laid in the
rlressiog»room of a cheap vaudeville
theater.
They are the second plays to be
written by these students in compe-
tition for the Henry York Steiner
Memorial prize. Last year, Mr.
Lamb's “The Faith-Cure Man" won
the production prize, while Mr.
Swift's play. “The Law," was also
presented.

Tryouts for three more plays. the
works of Kenneth Clayton, Frank
Fur-bush, and Joseph Erwin, members
or the elementary playwrlting class,
are being held this week. A large
percentage of the parts to be ﬁlled
are men's characters.

Woliinger Has
Wrenched Knee-

Coach Elton A. Rosen’s Crinnell
college swimmers will tangle for the
second time with the Drake univer-
sity mermen in the local pool Friday
afternoon at 4 o‘clock.

in the last meeting between the
two teams at Des Moines, the Ellie
and White won, 59 to 24.

Like the track squad, which has
had several men on the sick‘list
throughout the season, the Pioneer
paddlers have been visited by bad
luck. Wolﬁnger, who swims the dash
es, has been unable to report for
work this week because of a wrench»
ed knee. He may be able to perform
in the meet, but will not he in the
best of shape.

The rest of the team has been
showing steady signs of improvement,
and the Grinnell mentor expects it
to give a better account ot itself than
in the previous encounter.
