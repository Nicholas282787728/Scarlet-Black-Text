‘Novel Important
in Advancement, ’
Says Maynadier

"The novel has been
most important developments in Eng-
lish literature for the past two cen—

one of the

tunes," stated Professor Gustavus
Howard Maynedier in his first public
lecture, "What the novel is," yester-
day evening in Herrick chapel. Dr.
Maynadier, the Harvard exchange
professor, is now in Grinnell directing
a month’s course on "The English
novel between 1870 and 1914."

In attempting the difficult task of
defining the novel Professor Mayne,»
dier quoted 'the efforts of Smollett
and Austen who describe the novel
as “large” and “diffuse" and "pre<
senting the complexities of life in an
interesting story."

While admitting that novels may
vary in range, Professor Maynadier
believes that there are three tequi-
sites for the good novel, interest. ser—
iousness, and reality in both concep—
tion and presentation “In addition
to being a good story a novel should
have some meaning. From the earli-
est days of the novel authors have
set forth seriously their views on
human existence.” remarked the lac—
turer. He believes the great novelist
must have the art of the dramatist
in his ability to individualize his
characters.

In concluding Professor Maynadier
summed up the value of the novel
by saying that it has probably been
“the source of more solace, Comfort,
and encouragement than any other
form of literature." .

His next public lecture, “some Cone
temporary English Novelists," will
be Monday, March 23 at eight o'clock
in Herrick chapel.

Zecchi Plays Viva

ldi ’ s Concerto,

Scarlatti Sonatas, With Delicacy

(by Sarah Inncs McDonald)

A program which was almost
unique in its fredom from modern
touches was presented by Carlo Zec-
chi, eminent Italian pianist, in Her-
rick chapei March 11. It is singular
that by avoiding modern novelties the
concert itself achieved in highest de~
grec a novel content. _

Mr. zecchi had not completely res
covered from the illness, that had
necessitated a postponement of the
concert. but he played with all of the
clarity, brilliance. and musicaﬂ un-
derstanding for which he has become
internationally known.

The recital opened with a cone
to by Vivaldi, the early 18th century
violinist whose concertos served as
a model for so many of his succes
sors.

Two sonams by Scarlatti follows
ed, Although the Vivaldi concerto was
impeccably played, it was in these
sonatas that Mr, Zecchi displayed in
the highest degree the delicacy of
tone and the deftncss of technic so
characterisitic of this virtuoso and
so indispensible for interesting works
originally written for the harpsi-
chord.

Piano arrangements of organ works
are not uniformaly successful, but
the Busoni arrangement of Bach's
Toccata and Fugue in C Major, as

played by Carlo Zecchi, more than
justified itself. In the Toccata, vary-
ing planes of tone suggested vivid-
ly the traditional echoing back and
forth on different keyboards of the
organ. The Intermezzo. one of the
most appealing melodies ever written
by Bach was played with a beauti-
ful singing tone. The sprightly Fugue,
which invites pianistic treatment,
was brought up to a tremendous cli-
max, made possible by ingenious and
daring pcdalling,

Thc Schumann Fantaisie makes
most exacting demands technically,
intellectually, and emotionally. Proh-
ably the most difficult phase of in»
tcrpreting a work of this character
is to make it appeal in any degree
whatever to the casual listener. Mr.
chchi succcded in riveting the at-
tention of the audience, which is.
perhaps the highest praise that could
be tendered.

The last group comprised three
Liszt arrangements of Paganini
Etudes brilliantly played. Repeated-
ly recalled after each group, the pi-
anist played but one encore, and that
at the end of the concert when he
added Liszt’s F Minor Etude.

After the concert, Mr. Zecch: ex-
pressed his appreciation of the cor-
dial and understanding way in which
the audience received the somewhat
austere program.

Cornell Debate
Ends Season

Danforth, Polachek Argue
For Unemployment

Insurance

Thursday evening in the Langan
hall clubroom the 1930~31 debate sea—
son was brought to a close by the
Cornell debate on unemployment tn-
surance. Grinnell upheld the afﬁrma— a
tive in the naedecision debate.

The speakers for Grinnell were
Robert Poiachek and Edward Dan-
forth. They argued constructively
that there is a deﬁnite need for un-
employment insurance, that a busi-
nesslike plan must be adopted, that
the unemployment insurance plan has h
offered relief to other countries. and b
that the plan is economically sound.
The American Reserve plan, the Gen-
eral Electric plan, and the Rhode
Island plan were suggested by the af-
ﬁrmative. The afﬁrmative claims that
the Employment Stabilization Act
now before Congress is based on the
principle that “four cabinet members
shall study business and advise the
president of depressions" and that b
this act is unsound.

The negative, represented by Clar-
ence Richardson, and Basil Rafferty,
used as a basis for their argument
the principles that unemployment in-
surance as a principle is unpracticai,
that it is a problem to industry and
efﬁciency as well as a great ﬁnancial
problem, and that the unemployment
insurance plan is unbusinesslike.
Richardson in his speech told of the
success and failure of the German
and English unemployment insurance
plans. This type of insurance, the
negative said. could not be uniform
