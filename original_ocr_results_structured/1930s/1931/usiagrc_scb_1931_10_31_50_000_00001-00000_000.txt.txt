Fairfield Talks

to Journalists

‘Newspaperman Must Have
Liberal Education’

“The day is coming when all jour-
nalists will be from journalism
schools, and newspaper men and
women will not be successes just be-
cause they happened to start in the
work.” ’

That was the opening state-
ment of Edward G. Fairfield, editor
of the Dubuque Telegraph-Herald,
first speaker on the program of the
twelfth annual meeting of the Iowa
High School Press association here
Friday morning.

Mr. Fairfield believes that the day
when it was possible for any person
to step into a newspaper office and
get a good position, without prepara-
tion, is ended. Education alone does
not make good newspaper people, but
a good all around education, one
that would make one a student of
human affairs, make one capable of
commenting intelligently and of real-
izing the consequences, was the
course of study suggested for an as—
piring journalist.

Journalism schools, as all profes-
sional schools, are becoming over-
crowded, he soid. As these students
are graduated and secure positions,
they tend to draw down the salaries
of the older people and their own as
well, said Mr. Fail-field. The supply
is much greater than the demand.

Mr. Fairfield stressed that every
person who is considering entering
the journalism field for a life work
should aim higher than a reporter‘s
job. Too much of the work is slip
shod he believes, and the hard work-
er is noticcd in every office.

Helen Williams Returns
to College—Unmarried

Helen Williams, Grinnell college
junior and a transfer from Vassar
this year, returned to college Thurs-
day night after leaving Saturday to
meet her fiancee, Harry Vestosky in
New York City where they were to
be married.

A story carried by The Scarlet and
Black last Saturday informed her
father, a Grand Rapids, Mich, doctor
of the intended marriage, and he
went to New York to prevent it.
Miss Williams returned at the insist-
ence of her father, after securing his
consent to a later marriage,

BAUMANN ON PROGRAM

of history, will speak at the meeting

Hank Thomas, shifty quarterback
with the Grinnell football team,
managed to find one quarter which
he could devote to turning the Carle-
ton college eleven inside out last
night and, as a result, the Pioneers
won their game with the Carls, 19
to 13.

Although it was Thomas' game at
the close, the visitors got away for
a fast start with an assault on the
Grinnell goal. The Pioneers stopped
them a yard short of a counter, how.
ever, and Thomas pulled the fans to
their feet by faking a kick under his
goal posts and streaking to the 20-
yard stripe. An erroneous pass put
the locals back on their line and
Thomas’ kick was poor, giving the
Carls a second opportunity.

Nordly Scores

Nordly carried the oval over the
line and Remington was the lad who
booted the additional point.

Thomas opened Grinnell activi es
in the second canto by downing Bro-
berg‘s kick on the 25-yard stripe.
James skirted tackle for five yards
and Thomas then took the leather
through the same hole for 61 yards
and a touchdown. The pass for an
extra point failed.

Graftund Takes Pass

Carleton received but Graflund in—
tercepted a pass on the 45-yard
stripe on the second play. A 15-yard
penalty put the Pioneers 30 yards
from the goal ribbon. The quarter-
back passed to Graflund on the next
play for a touchdown. Thomas drop-
kicked for the point.

Late in the period McKee stopped
Carleton's offensive by recovering a
fumble 44 yards from goal. Alexand—
er negotiated six yards at the right
side of the line before he slipped, and

Irwin Prepares

for Play--Buys
Much Hair Tonic

"No MacTaviSh was ever lavish,"
man Ogden Nash reﬂection that
doesn’t hold Water as far as Joseph
Irwin is concerned. Ear weeks Mr.
Irwin. ’31, assistant in the drama de-
partment, has been scattering his
pennies among the local druggists
for countless bottles of hair grower
and vaseline.

Persistent applications have re-
rewarded Mr. Irwin, and a genuine
black mustache will lend realism to
his portrayal of James Fraser, the
middleaged Scotchman who is the
pivot of that amusing play "The
First, Mrs. Fraser.”

Homecoming theater-goers will be
further entertained by Mr. Irwin’s
hurry Scotch accent. which nightly
rehearsals for the last month has
perfected. A little padding on Mr.
Irwin's physique has resulted in a
“verdndah” which should deceive the
skeptical.

Mr, Il'Win is better known To Grim
nell audiences as a playwright, being
the author of "As it Was in the Be-
ginning," an expressionistic comedy
which was entered in the Henry York
Steiner contest last year. and was
presented at commencement. Mr. Ir~
win is new graduate assistant to
Mrs. Sara Sherman Pryor, director of
