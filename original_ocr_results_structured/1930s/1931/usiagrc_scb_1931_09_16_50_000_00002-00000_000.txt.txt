DISGRAGE OR OPPORTUNITY?

Tllc anllual division of freshmen into tllltcc
groups for the study of English has been accomp-
lished agaill with the usual llumhcr Showing c ,
ceptional ability, tllc majority in the middle divis-

' ion, and a certain fcw faking English X.

English X, as now given, is meant for the in
strllctioll of the student and is in no way punislh
mellt for lack of ability or training ill English
work. There are numerous causes for deﬁciency ill
English, often more lack of application by the slur
dent to fundamentals and sometimes failure on
the part of the high school which he attended to
provide adequate instruction.

The extra class periods in English X offer
the student wllo does not show capabilities ill such
work an opportunity to learn something which is
going to serve him throughout his life. More to
the point, it may prevent him from receiving a
condition in English during his ﬁrst college year,

Students who have been victims of poor high
school instruction should welcome the course, Tllosc
who have simply found nothing of interest ill Eng-
lish should go to the course here unprejudiced, for
new methods of teaching often changc the entire
aspect of the work It is well for them to remem-
ber that the most Successful men ill many lines
havc succeeded ill spite of handicaps.

WHY CONVENTIONS?

“That Young Thcta Sig,” all article by Mir-
ianl Spaulding ill the August Matrix, bears out the
contention that a large part of the value in con
vcutions lies ill thi: associations rather than in the
speeches listed for the convention sessions. Every
convention, whether journalistic, or for a group
interested in some other profession brings to-
gether men and women interested ill the same
work but meeting different problems, solving them
ill different ways. '

' Molly persons believe that conventions serve
little purpose and contend that they have been
particularly overclnphasizcd in America during the
last decade. This may be the case. Delegations
Should be kept to a minimum rather than bolstered
to a maximum. Such a policy keeps a convention
from becoming too big to operate efﬁciently and
still giv ' tho loaders from each center the desired
Contact with men who have solved problems in
the ﬁeld. Gtcncral results can be given ill rcporfs
to these who remained at home later.

Thc necessary part ill such a proccdurc is the
choosing of a l - l or woman with tile vigor to
retain idcas oblalilcd at the meeting, and who ill
retaining them, will show lllc enthusiasm llccc ,

y to push them to a successful standing at
home.

M Spouldillg pl ' llted many new ideas to
Theta Sigma Phi llcl'c this noon. Every woman in
Alpha Delta chapter is ollc of the leaders on tllc
Grillncll campus. The jourllalislic fraternity ‘I'Or

' women has already mode a distinct mark for itsclf
on the campus and under the guidance of capable
students this your should become even more deeply
ilnbctldcd into Grillncll life

A CHALLENGE

A request which amounts to a challenge was
read to students ill their Monday and Tucsday
classes th' Week, .

The library conunittcc and Miss Clark cour-
lcously asked that this year the library be kept
very quiet, and rcscrvcd for study only. It is a
reasonable request and one to which everyone
agrees without a moment’s hesitation But it ill-
volvcs action as well as agreement, and this is
where the challenge li ' Can students remember
not to talk at all ill the upstairs reading room?

KIND DR CRUEL
The ﬁrst rumpus opinion iii The Scarlet and
Block iiiii-iiig- the 1930.31 academic yelll' was one
ill which the staff lnmllbel- handling the signs
lllQlli 1 hell sovcrzll fi'rslliilell for their opinions
of Grillltcll. That could scarcoly have, been a
just ([ilcslioll. The students had scarcely b on
permitted sufficient time to form any opilli is
regarding the limits of Grinllcll as a collogc, and
(‘\'L‘ll tliOllg‘ll opinions llllg‘ t llo formed, the now-
collirrs would naturally be rcticcut about cxprcssr
illg condemnation of the school.

Many newcomers will form all illdcﬁllablc
love for Grillllell. The college has that faculty
of becoming interwoven with fond lllcluori .‘ and
retaining its place in later life. ’l‘hcrc arc those

FIRST YEAR IN COLLEGE

In a cllapcl address last , or H. W, Norri
professor of zoology, made zt statenlcnt to the e
foot that college, especially the first year, is an ad-
vcuturc in frecdom.

Most studculs on coming to college act on that
precept whether they are accurately conscious of
it or not, and by their reaction to the situation
tllvidc themselves into two classcs. One class roe
lilalltically believes itself absolutely free, only to
later realize that there is no such thing as absolute
frcedolll or cvcil all approach to it,

The other class doesn’t realize the extent of
its freedom and so neglects to procure for itself
a chart for tllc new waters. Actually each student
probably belongs to both these classes : in one class
in some of his thinking and attitudes, and in the
other class ill other habits of mind.

The real point is that. few grasp the situation
accurately. Chapel, vespcrs, orientation courses,
and discussion groups on vocations are all illtclld-
cd to help the student understand the dcgr c and
quality of his now freedom, and to assist him in
choosing it goal and a sct of ideals to aid him in
adjusting to it most effectively.

None of these things, of course, are valuable
lo the student unless he rcalizes his need for them
but any student who dcsircs to make the most of
his college course, with the greatest economy of
effort, will try to really understand the situation
of which he has become a part all entering college.
He will draw on every available source of inspire
alion and knowledge ill an attempt to make the
most workable and most pleasant adjustment to
that situation.

READING OFF THE DOLE
(From the Boston Transcript)

It is a remarkable situation which ﬁnds the Amerr
icnn people, or a large element of them, dreading the
next session of their national congress as never before.
Composed chiefly of politicians, whose highest ambi-
tion is to re-eiect themselves, congress is prepared with
a multitude of plans for spending the public money,
while the administration is placed in the exceedingly
uncomfortable position of trying to prevent it from
doing it. The debt, an institution which generally be—
comes permanent wherever it is adopted. looms on the
one hand while on the other extravagant demands for
farmers' aid are already taking shape in the form of
a. new version of the equalization fee which Will'cr‘eate
a preferred class among our producers. While business
shows signs of general improvement, the doctrine per~
sists in many quarters that if the people cannot feed,
clothe and house themselves, the government must do
it.

In sound opposition to this theory President Hoover
is doing all in his power to canvass and Co~ordlnata the
various state, municipal and private activities, in pre—
paration for the demands that will be made upon him
later, The chamber of commerce, U. S. A.. has under-
taken this tremendous task of investigating, at his re-
quest, and Mr. Hoover was visited at the white house
this week by Julius H, Barnes and Silas H. Strawn,
chairman of the board and president respectively of
that organization, for or conference as to prospective
ways and means, Neither of these gentlemen believe
in the dole system, yet all fear its imminenc - and
President Hoover is determined to put himself in such
a position that the Federal government may act in—
telligently in dealing with unemployment and its effects
when the proper time comes later in the year, r i» s

The president's policy is to familiarize himself with
conditions throughout the country, in as much detail as
possible, that he may weigh the respective possihi ties
of state, municipal, private and industrial aid, with a
view to averting a dumping‘ of the whole responsibility
for taking care of the needy upon the federal govern-
ment; or, to put is differently, to estimating how far
the federal government may feel itself warranted in
associating itself with these various agencies of aid.
We believe this Course to be eminently businesslike and
proper. The federal government will avoid no oppor-
tunity to render proper assistance to the states, cities
and towns, but it should rather supplement their ef-
forts than assume the burden itself, for a national dole
system, such as many ivildeyed statesmen will advocate.
must be headed off at any cost.
