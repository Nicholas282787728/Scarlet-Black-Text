in nature’s way

CAMELS are never parched 0r toasted."

FRESHNESS and ﬂavor in a cigarette trace right
back to natural moisture.

If you overheat or process tobacco so harshly as
to dry out all natural moisture you drive out fresh-

ness and ﬂavor too.

Camel never patches or toasts the ﬁne Turkish and
mild Domestic tobaccos it uses — they are naturally
smooth, cool, mellow, with natural moisture retained.

That’s why the Camel Humidor Pack proves such a

blessing to Camel smokers—i! brings them a ﬁne

cigarette fresh to start with, and fresh to smoke.
If you don’t realize what natural moisture means in

genuine freshness and ﬂavor, switch to Camels and see.
