By RUTH POIDL
Approximately 215 delegates rep-
resenting 33 schools in the state were
present at the twelfth annual con-
vention of the Iowa High School
Press'associattion which opened in
Grinnell this morning.

One special goal of this meeting is
the reorganization of the association
to include the advisors and make the
association statewide.

An address on journalism was
made this morning by E. G. Falrfield,
editor of a Dubuque paper. In his
address Mr. Fairfield said. “A good
all-around education is the best
equipment you can carry with you
into a newspaper office." He also
stated that if one has the necessary
background in the work he would
succeed whether or not he received
a diploma from a journalistic school.
Converse Speaks
Prof. Blair Converse, from Iowa
State college, spoke on technical
journalism at the afternoon session.
Mr, Converse has compiled a score
card in which he has placed curiosity
as the first essential to make a suc-
cessful journalist. After this he lists

good for 15 more at right end and
scored. The kick foiled.

Visitors Try Agnin

Carleton got under way in the
third period after a Grinncll drive
had pounded deep into the visitors
tcriiioiy. A bad pass from center
was recovered in midfield by Carla-
ton and n pass to £11912 yard line
was judged good when the rcccivcr
was pushed. The Pionccrs held but
the kick was bad and thc Carlsvtook
the oval 20 yards from a. score.
Plunges by Remington, Droberg, and
Sccwold put it over.

Carleton threatened again in the
final quarter, going to the Grinnell
Ioeycrd lino before being stopped.
The game ended as Thomas inter-
cepted a Carleton pass on his own
zsyard mark.

Although Crinncll outgained Carle-
tori in scrimmagc, the Pioneers made
only three first downs to 13 for the
losers, The visitors tried 17 passes
and completed only four while Grins
nell made four out of 9 good.
Broberg and Nordly slashed
through the Criiinell line for regular
gains, but made six fumbles which
ruined the assault. Thomas was the
consistent ground gainci— for Crin-
noll. Both clcvens showed better
work on the offense than on defense.
Grsflund and Christoffcrsen were
Grinnell's stars on defense while
Ferguson and Bchmiler were Carlee

the Dodger, Fort Dodge, third.
The annual contest for the front
page make-up and allvaround news-
papers will not be held until later in
the year, because it was felt that as
thc convention came so early in the
year, the present staffs would not be
able to put out the quality of a paper
possible later in the year.

ing this morning.

the max-gin was sufficient to earn an
easy victory,

The work of Walter Stralcy in ac.

and the defensive play of Chick

features of the game. Larry Hunt,
Dibble freshman, scored six points
