0!.“ LIKE KIN.

A college must keep step. As the world
changes the college must change also. From Iowa
college to Grinncll, from rooms in town to the d-or~
mitorics, from afternoon football to a lighted grid-
iron—these have all been major steps ill Griliilcll’s
progress.

Yet, year after year the alumni return for
Homecoming. throng tllc campus, the dormitories
and the quadrangle, and relate tales of former years.
It is really Homecoming to them, although thcr c
few people here wlln were students when they were.
Men and woman wllo graduated since the start of
the century know some of tllc profosso while
others who groduatcd before 1900 can find only
the campus self ill their respective memories.

Homecoming ill Grillnell. however, means some-
thing to tho alumnus of 1893 as well as the (111111]-
nus of 1928. Whether or not the campus ‘ rcmcmr
bored, whether or not faculty members are
acquaintances is of little consequence. The Homc<

they may be older, but after all, they’re all of one

THE DISCUSSION GROUPS

Thursday night saw the ﬁrst of tile Young
Men’s Chr tiall association meetings of the your
to be conducted on the discussion group plan. There
were three groups. Prof. Paul S. Wood led his
group in considering the topic of campus problems,
Prof. Earl D. Strong discussed Russia from the
economic and social stalldpcints with his group,
and the Rev, Mr. Barttcr from Gillliail tool: up the
topic of religion.

The discussions were undoubtedly of Value
from their more content, but probably the most
important aspect of the method was the contact of
students and faculty members ill an informal way.
If the student knows personally the professor who
is dttcmpting to teach him something, tllc pro-
fessor and the student both have a llluch greater
chance of deriving satisfaction from the associa-
tion than would otherwise be possible.

It is particularly interesting to the student to
discover that his professor is human by first hand
contact with his viewpoints. Beside the valuable
points of view to be gained from a discussion group,
there is the extra value of nclationships that are
a part of daily classroom work.

It is wrong to lot ll fl-cslllllall student, who,

to lcuvc at the end of tho first semester, to spend

cate of graduation in liberal studies, which is to
be presented at the end of the second university
year, would not mean lunch if the recipient was
not allowed to continue study ill the junior class.

CIVILIZED CLASS SCRAPS
(From the Des Moines Trundle-Capital)

In the minds of many people, American college life
is associated with cruel hazings and brutal class ﬁghts.
While these practices aren’t as bad as they‘re often paint—
ed, or as they were a generation ago, they often result in
personal injury and property damage. Some students
have been permanently maimed, and a few have been
killed, in campus scraps.

Thus it is good news that. Grinnell, following the
lead of other enlightened colleges. has Converted its
formerly rough and dangerous freshman-sophomore
battle into an organized contest in lugging sand bags
down the football ﬁeld. The new type of scrap will be
tame compared with the Old, but it Won't. result in as
many injuries.

College students need an outlet for their excess
spirits, but. it is possible for them to ﬁnd such an out

STUDENTS AND AUTOMOBILES
(From the Daily Iowan)

Several ln-rge universities forbid students to have
automobiles in their possession, The principal reason
for ruling admittedly is that the automobile is consid-
ered a rival of books for the student’s time,

According to this theory, the student with a. car
is continually tempted to get behind the wheel and ”go
places,” and more often than not yields to the tempts-
tion to the detriment of his learning.

But properly used, the automobile is a time saver
for the student, 'as for anyone. With classes for from
his place of residence, usually the case at a university,
this handy means of transportation will save the aver—
age colleginn from 15 to 45 minutes each day, depend-
ing on the distances he must traverse and the number
of trips back and forth he must m'ake.

The conscientious disciple will apply the additional
time to his school work.

Those who let the automobile interfere with ob-
taining the most from college, if deprived of their cars,
would ﬁnd some other excuse for avoiding their books.

Tribute to Vergil-

abandoned farms.

The poet labored for seven years.
writing and rewriting. but finally he
presented Augustus with four
poems. which he called the
”Georgics,” each of which was little
more than 500 lines long. These
”Georgics” are reputed to be one of
the few examples of attained perfec-
tion in poetry in existence.

Vergil also made a name for him-
self when he wrote the "Eclogues."
10 poems in pastoral style, and one
of them so seemed to he a. prophecy
of the birth of Christ, that he was
given a place on the church's calen-
der of saints.

still Remembered

Vergil wrote much of the golden
days that were to come to Rome un-
der the rule of Augustus and his suc-
cessors, but deep down in his heart
he knew that Rome’s finest days had
passed.

He was genuinely interested in ev»
ery living thing, and showed sympa-
thy iu all of his writings. He was
loved in his own time, and is still re-
membered, even though 2,000 years
have intervened.
