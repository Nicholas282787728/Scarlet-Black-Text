GUNS FOR DRUMS

Since the Czechoslovakia—German crisises
of last May, drums have been turned into
guns along the Danube. All Europe is mos
bilized, waiting for Hitler’s plunge into
Czechoslovakia—and out of the Hitlers
Chamberlain conversations, it appears that
Czechoslovakia is to be given a week in
which to prepare for a progressive giving
up of her Sudeten regions.

Let’s assume that this awful crisis will
be settled without resort to war and that
Germany acquires Sudetenland. What then?
It appears that England and France are
hoping for a general conference of the Eu-
ropean great powers to settle all the out—
standing issues dividing them, and that
such a settlement will lead to a stabiliza—
tion of the continent, gradual reduction of
armaments, and a beginning of some years
of peace based on the equality of the great
powers. Certainly if this happens, Chamber-
lain will go down as one of the great heroes
of history.

But does Hitler want a general settle—
ment, bringing with it the stabilization of
Europe, based on the equality of the great
powers? of course, we don‘t know what
Hitler wants, and he may not be sure what
he wants, but all recent tendencies seem to
indicate that he wants absolute control of
central and southeastern Europe. Should
this happen, Germany will have more than
equality. She will have definite supremacy,
which, in the long run, means the relegation
of France to a second class power, and, if
Hitler lasts long enough, a locking horns
with Great Britain,

We may be sure that France and England
are aware of this, but they are taking a
chance that postponement will give them
time to see a way out. Their attitude now
seems to be that the last war was deplors
able in its origin, its course, and its long
run results; that the next war is bound to
be equally deplorable, that the League of
Nations is deplorable, that nothing short of
pacifism can be of any avail, and pacifism
is itself a hopeless or unattainable ideal;
and that it therefore follows from available
evidence that the only practical present ob-
ject isto prevent the next war at any cost.

But Anthony Eden says a stand must be
taken now. Who is right? It is anybody’s

guess (Meanwhile, hefoxc this editorial ap-
peais in plint, war may have begun We
hope not )

G
A RENEWED SPIRIT

As many of us realized last night, noth-
ing stands out at an athletic contest, aside
from the performance of the home team it-
self, like the showing of the college bond.
Every Grinnell student, faculty membel
and outside visitor should have been agree-
ably surprised and delighted with the res
sults of the game last night. It was a splen-
did start toward a better season than Grin-
nell has seen in years.

The band‘.7 For an organization two days
old, under a new director, Robert S. Vag-
ner, the results also show considerable pros
mise; and congratulations are now in line
to the members of the band and its director.
This newspaper is indeed grateful to know
that 32 students have, so early in the year,
shown enough interest in their college to
play in its band.

In spite of this, however, we shall ful'tl‘k
or encourage membership. Every section of
the band needs strengthening, especially the
clarinet and alto sections. The need has now
been recognized, and support is being pl'Ov
mised and given. Out of an enrollment of
800 students, we should expect many in the
college who play band instruments. There
should be competition and rivalry for a
place in the band, instead of a school-wide
appeal to bolster the membership.

We like to boast at times of a certain
Grinnell spirit. That spirit has been hiding
out a great deal in past years, but with a
football team like the one which performed
for us against Cornell and a band with
some Yumph, as was shown last night,
there ought to be a revival into reality of
what a good many students imagine to be
the Grinnell spirit.

This newspaper congratulates the spirit
of the student ,body at the Cornell game
last night; it glorifies the Pioneer team: it
praises the band; and, further, it urges a
continuance of that Grinnell spirit which
was so prevalent last night.

OUR YOUTH MAY SPEAK

(Reprinted from Los Angeles Collegian)

It is the conscensus of educators‘ and
political lenders‘ opinion, that youth is ex-
ceedingly plastic. It can be molded into
hating and fearing and loving and knowing
and not knowing.

Ill Europe, youth is being educated for
the fatherland; for prospective cannon-
fodder that will gladly die for a cause—ally
cause.

In America the pictule is not so dark.
In this nation are youth movements that
are initiated by youth and sponsored solely
by and for youth. In a way, some of them
are opposed to the government; in them is
an element of defiance of the “spirit of
patliotism;” they ale intrinsically different
floln European youth movements

They talk of peace, they encourage a
fmm of individualism that would make it
self evident in time of war. They speak a
language that would cause them to be
snuffed out in a minute were they in any
European country.

The practicability of youth movements
for peace, for better educational facilities,
for clean politics, for tolerance in subordi-
nate to the fact that they do and can exist
in this country.

"The periodic nature of migraine headache
attacks is one of the most remarkable and
interesting things in the whole of internal
medicine. Tending to affect especially
those in high places, it might even change
the destiny of the world, were an attack to
occur at a vital moment in the life of a
dictator." Dr. Thomas Hunt of London
believes such a headache could change the
course of history.
