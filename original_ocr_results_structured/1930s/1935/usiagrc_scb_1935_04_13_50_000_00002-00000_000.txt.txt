BIG HEARTED IOWA

Editorial comment on the current rumpus at
the University of Iowa has so far—throughout the
state—been noticeable for its absence, In gene
eral it is the kind of situation which is both dif
ficult and dangerous to comment upon; but a
phase of'the matter has been pointed out to us
by a member of the Grinnell college administra—
tion which we feel should be given prominent
notice.

No doubt everyone who read the introductory
stories concerning the scandal were struck by the
greatly predominant number of out-of—state stu-
dents involved. Of the 23 members in the fra-
ternity, only two are residgns of Iowaithe rest
living in the east, mainly in New York and New
Jersey. Since the fraternity in question was a
Jewish organization it obviously could hot be ac-
cepted as reﬂecting accurately the proportion of
out-of-state students attending he university. It
did create the question in many minds, however,
as to just how many men and women from other
states are in the student body.

In this connection the local administrative
officer pointed out the fact that in 1932-33—which
we accept as a representative yearislightly more
than one-fourth of the students attending Iowa
were from other states. The number amounted
to more than 2,100 students; 8,400 being the total
enrollment. The officials of the university esti-
mate that it costs the state $550 to send each stu—
dent to school for one year. The tuition for out-
of—state students is but $135 annually; as a re»
sult it costs the state of Iowa $415 per year for
each outrof-state student it educates. Multi-
plying that sum by the number of such students
attending Iowa in 1932—33 we find that they cost
the citiiens of Iowa over $875,000 for that single
school year. And that—let us assure you—is
the equivalent of a mighty lot of sales-tax pennies.

So ignon'ng the immediate difficulty at Iowa
and considering only the broader~and in reality,
more serious problem which it brings to light, it
seems that regardless of what out—of—thestate
students do, what kind of parties they throw,
and what their moral standards may be, expend-
ing $875,000 a year to attract them to Iowa is
carrying state philanthropy too far.

Just keep in mind hereafter when you be-
grudgingly dig for that extra penny or two for
sales tax that a portion of it will go to make life
easy for out-of—the-staters at Iowa U.; and when
Dad writes and tells you how he’s been sweating
blood over a state income tax report, dwell mo-
mentarily on the happy thought that a part of
that hard earned cash, also, is to be devoted to
this charitable cause of “cheap education for all,"

While the state is sending investigators to
examine the situation at the university, they
might have them look into this matter, also. Of
course in these days when Uncle Sam is talking
in terms of billions, a sum short of a million
sounds like chicken feed; but out here in Ioway
$875,000 is still big money.

GIVE THE SINGERS A BREAK

While the glee club concert last evening was
the same delightful entertainment that it al-
ways is, there were some members of the audi—
cnce who felt that it would be more appropriate
if the membership of the organization were con-
fined solely to students. It has been the custom
for many years to have the director, and at times
one or two other faculty members, regular mem-
bers of the glee club. Perhaps when this cus-
tom originated the sections to which the faculty
singci-s lent their assistance were weak or there
was some other practical reason for their presr
once in the chorus. This, however, has hardly
bccn the case in recent ycais.

The same complaint might be made in con-
nection with the male quartet. It seems un-
fair that certain parts should always be monopo-
lizetl by singers from the faculty, when under-
graduate members of the club are perfectly cap-
able of handling them. To permit a member
of the club to sing in the quartet is one of thc

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

few ways in which recognition of his ability
can be bestowed. Solo parts in the group selec-
tions are comparatively few and usually brief,
and it is rare that more than one member a year
is honored by being made a soloist in his own
right; so it seems feasible that places in the quar-
tet should be reserved for student singers alone.

This suggestion is in no way aimed as a crit-
icism of the singers from the faculty who have
been assisting the club. It is an expression of
a sentiment which we have found quite prevalent
on the campus, among both students and faculty
members. Student dramatics are conﬁned to
the students; student publications are kept free
from faculty supervision; the faculty even sees
fit to permit full responsibility for such activities
as the International Relations conference to {all
upon the students’ shoulders. Why not give the
members of the Men’s Glee club a break?

FRIDAY ASSEMBLY

The reactions to the Friday morning student
chapel sponsored by the League for Industrial
Democracy varied among the students on this
campus. One matter in particular, however,
impressed a majority of the hearers. That
was the courage and sincerity of the students
who took part in the program. It was evident
that from the delivery and the content of the
speeches that much careful preparation and
thought and been spent in drawing them up. In
the face of the apparent cynicism of a large part
of the student body, it took a great deal of initia—
tive and firmness of conviction for those four stu»
dents to take part in such a program. They de-
serve a full measure of commendation for their
action. '

While nothing essentially new was said,
and no concrete proposals of action were made,
the speeches brought home to all who listened
the necessity of giving serious thought to the
question of world peace, In a larger sense, they
emphasized the importance of interest in'and
consideration of all sorts of vital problems of the
day. In the narrow collegiate world, one fre-
quently loses sight of those problems which his
parents are meeting every day and which he is
destined to meet in all too Short a time.

Whether or not one agrees with what was
said in chapel Friday morning, it would be well
to notice here was a genuine attempt to over-
come the passive attitude of the large majority
of students and to arouse interest in the problems
and issues outside of the campus world. Herein
lies the genuine value of the work of those four
students. It is to be hoped that their fine work
possibly under the leadership of the Men’s and
will be carried on in the future by other students,
Women’s Forensic clubs. In this way the Fri—
day morning chapel can become a means of stu-
dent expressions upon vital issues and a source
of stimulating thought for the student body as
a whole. —R. W,

ANOTHER FUTILE CONFERENCE

Amidst the roar of hovering airplanes and
guarded by heavily armed Italian troops, the
three-power conference at Stresa, Italy opened
this week. The conference, called to consider unit—
ed action on the part of England, France, and Italy
on the German situation, has so far accomplished
little.

In spite of the fact that the high, dignitaries
of the three countries are present at .the confer-
ence, the hope of any great achievement seems
slight. In fact the very nature of such a con—
ference—consisting of only three powers—can
lead to but one result, namely some sort of a de»
fensive or offensive alliance against Germany in-
stead of an agreement really designed to iron out
the difficulties and secure permanent peace.

Germany certainly will not consider as bind-
ing any agreement drawn up by a conference in
which she is not represented. Not only that,
but several other countries which are vitally in-
terested in the peace of Europe and of the world
have been left out. Russia, Poland, Czecho~
Slavakia, Jugoslavia and Roumania have a stake
in the prospect for peace, yet they have not been
considered in the present conference. It is true
that Anthony Eden, British statesman, made a
tour of'the European capitals just prior to the
opening of the meeting; but his negotiations were
of the individualvalliance type, designed to se-
cure allies in a war rather than to prevent the
outbreak of war. Obviously this type of agree-
ment will not promote the general peace of Eu—
rope.

And so today Europe is slowly but steadily
drifting into an alignment of two armed camps.
Germany is on one side, partly supported by the
nations that desire the revision of the Versailles
treaty; on the other side England, France, and
Italy, supported by the other nations that desire
the maintenance of the status quo.

With this state of affairs, the probability of
war is greatly increased, and no amount of so—
called diplomacy in limited conferences will ease
the situation. Instead both sides must be given
a hearing and an amicable settlement worked out
taking cognizance of the rights of the disputants.

To most easily obtain such an agreement a
general conference might be called and both
sides of the problem reviewed. Such a proposal
would be quite practical since the machinery for
such an effort is already at hand in the League of
Nations, which provides a place where both sides
can meet without endangering the dignity of the
respective governments at home,

It is difficult to understand why countries
persist in going off by themselves~as at Stl‘esai
to negotiate obviously futile defensive and offen-

sive alliances. It can only be hoped that if the com ,

ference at Stresa is unsuccessful—as now seems
inevitable—that its failure will be so complete and
so emphasize the futility of one sided conferences
as a means of securing any form of permanent
peace, that it will hasten the calling of a general,
world conference.

Concert Tuesday

A program of new works for cym.
phonic bands will be presented by the
enlarged college concert hand Tues.
day evening in is spring concert. The
program will be held in Herrick
chapel beginning at 3 o'clock. No ad.
mission will be charged.

The opening number is a concert
march by Buchﬁl. Following this the
band will play one of the most out.
standing numbers written for band. ac—
cording to Chester Williams, director
of the organization. It is the “Sym.
phony" by Fauchet which is the first
of its kind to be written for band. The
first movement is in the form of an
overture with the solo horn and cor.
net announcing the prelude theme.
This resolves into a lighter and faster
figure which is the principle theme
of the movement.

Modern Raphsody

The third number, “Headlines," is
a modern raphsody by Colby, written
in the style of Gershwin and his con.
temporaries. It is light and intercsia
ing with a good tune and catchy
rhythm, Williams states.

The concert comes to a close ‘with
Weinberger's “Polka and Fugue” from
the opera “Schwanda, the Bagpiper.”
Schwanda was a marvelous musician,
Williams explains, who had the gift
of making all dance to his piping, 1n
the “Polka and Fugue" is heard some
of the tunes played by the piper, and
the development of the rugue brings
together several of these tunes played
simultaneously by various sections of
the band.

In the past few years a movement
has developed among the high schools
and colleges of this country concern.

discussing the trend in band music.
The standard concert consisting of
marches, overtures, ﬂorid polkas, and
so forth has reached is limit and a

With the appearance of the symphonic
band and new musical liberature the
change seemspossible, the band direc.
tor feels. The addition of 'cellos,string
bass, and harp with a rearrangement
of the wood-winds and solo brasses
introduces this new era of band con.

CHAPEL
NOTES

“Beauty"—-its moaning and signif-
icauce to an individual in everyday
livingiwas discussed at chapel dur.
ing the past week by George L. Pierce,
professor of piano.

“In the development of on individual
to increase his ability to lead a rich
and happy life, the study and cultivaa
tion of beauty is to be desired," Pro.
fessor Pierce stated. “Beauty is not
an individual possession; it is to be
found in the social environment, as
well as in contemplation of nature,
literature and art."

“Beauty cannot be defined, as it
is perceived differently by each of us.
To cultivate this perception requires
careful, accurate observation, and a
great deal of study. and thought," he
elaborated. One should give careful
consideration to the greatest works in
painting, sculpture, music, and poetry.
for only then can he establish stand.
ards for his own decisions and his
own creative work, Professor Pierce
declared, “Thus we can discriminate
between the ideal and the less perfect
and acquire a deeper appreciation of
beauty," he concluded.

To the Editor

The Scarlet and Black

To the Editor:

For the first time in many years,
Grinnell college will be in session dur.
N the Passion week.

That week has been set apart all
over the Christian world to com.

betrayal, trial and crucifixion of Jesus.
Our chapel services have been set
apart during that week for this ob.
servancc and will follow as far as
possible the events of each day. The
Christian associations are uniting with
the faculty to make these services
significant.

If the attendance upon them is no
larger than that drawn out by the
daily chapel and if that attendance or
lack of it is indicative of the students'
interest in the Christian religion, then
the claim that Grinnell is a Chris.
tian college cannot be longer main.
tained.

Students and faculty alike are apt
to forget that Grinncll college was
founded by men whose inspiration to
sacrificial labor came from their faith
in the life and teachings of Jesus,
and that the motto of the college as en.
graved upon its'seal is "christo Duce."
(The above letter was submitted by
a member of the faculty, whose name
is withheld at his request.)

Dr. Lelioy D. Weld, professor of
physics of Coe college, now possesses
over 5,000 physics term definitions.
