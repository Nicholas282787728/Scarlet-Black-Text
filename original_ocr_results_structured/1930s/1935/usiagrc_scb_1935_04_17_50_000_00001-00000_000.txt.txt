Four men will participate in the
Kansas relays while is or 18 men will

State Teachers relays Saturday, Lester
Duke, track coach, announced yester—
day. As a result of the time trials

cided to enter the mile relay team in
the Kansas meet. The balance of the
‘squad will be taken to the State
Teachers meet. \

As yet the exact makc.up of the
mile quartet has not been decided.
according to Duke, but the team will
be selected from five men—Clark, An.
deison, Barnes, Bentley, McKlvcen.
depending upon who shows the best
work in the remaining workouts this
week.

Shins Positions

Duke states that he was Very
pleased with the showing oi the
team in its time try.outs yesterday. He
has shifted Clark to the lead—off pos-
ition, and expects the change to
strengthen the team considerably. “The
biggest difficulty so far this year,” he
explained, has been to get a good
start, and i believe that Clark will be
able to do this.”

The squad which will go no Cedar
Falls will have a good chance of plac.
ing high, Duke believes. Although
the team will be handicapped in the
relay events by the absence of the
relay men who go to Kansas, still
the prospects of the Pioneers garner.
ing their share of the points is good.

Preps May Compete
in Four Track Meets

Grinnell lrshman track men will
take part in at least three meets and
probably four this year, according to
Lester Duke, track coach. The preps
will run in the inter—class meet April
30—May 1, the conference freshman
telegraphic meet, the date of which
has not yet been announced, and. the
intramural competition, for which the
time has yet to be selected.

in addition, Duke stated, a dual con-
test has been tentatively arranged with
the varsity squad of Central college
of Pella, which will probably be held
May 10, pending faculty approval and
the selection of a place to hold the
meet.

Inclement weather forcing both the
varsity and freshman squads to work
out indoors has given him little
chance in make any deﬁnite decisions
about the relative merits oi the var.
ious preps, Dukc said.

He has appointed Jobn_llayward and
Lynn Schlatterbeck to make an in.
Vestlgetion of possible mndidates for
the freshman team. He is planning
on using the intendass meet as a
tryout for 911? Pm before the Gen.
trill dual.
