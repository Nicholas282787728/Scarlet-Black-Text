OUTSTANDING NOVELS

OF THE YEAR

Because you cannot make a good cigarette
from just one year’s crop there are today 4%
miles of warehouses ﬁlled with cigarette tobac—
cos from the crops of 1931—32-33—34ﬁm0st of
it for Chesterﬁeld cigarettes.

Just as money accumulates interest, two
and a half years of ageing makes these tobaccos
milder and naturally sweeter.

Think what this means—3n ez’g/Ity-ﬁw mil—
lion dollar 7'8ﬂ507l why men and women who
smoke Chesterﬁelds will always enjoy a milder,

better-tasting cigarette.
