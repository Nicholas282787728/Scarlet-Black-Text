COOPERATION NEEDED

The recent decision of the Council of House
Presidents to renew the system of table heads
in the men’s dining room marks an attempt to
check a condition which has rapidly grown worse
mnamely the disorder which has been more or
less prevalent in the men’s dining hall, The
decision to return to the practice of having speci.
fically appointed table heads, may or may not be
the solution to the problem, depending upon how
efficient the table heads are, but nevertheless. it
marks an attempt to deal with a highly unsatiSr
factory condition.

No one would claim that men are in the
habit of acting like angels, and especially in re—
ard to table manners. But there are certain
. its to anything, and to horseplay especially.
Fun is fun, but it can be carried too far. and
there have been numerous complaints that the
behavior of the diners has not been above res
preach, even judged by the most liberal stand-
ards.

Not only do slovenly table habits tend to
have harmful effects upon the individuals, but
y react upon the reputation of the school as
ll. Poor table manners in younger children
often are excused because “they do not know
any better," but this can hardly be applied to sup.
posed students of higher learning. Consequently
when visitors cat in the men's dining room, they
get a very poor impression of the college in gen.
cral, basing their judgments upon the poor man—
ners displayed by the college men. Needless to
., :kis is an unfortunate situation.

The doc ion of the men’s council to renew
"de system of having table heads, who will endea»
or to keep order, is a wise move, but this action
lone with not suffice to abolish the present dis—
agreeable situation. To adequately deal with the
condition, all of the men eating in the dining hall
will have to cooperate in the effort to promote

better manners. If. this is not done, then the
project is doomed to failure from the start, and
will in the long run he a quite futile move, only
by cooperation, and by cooperation alone, can the
unsatisfactory be remedied.

A WORTHY REVIVAL

The traditional senior-sophomore banquet
which was revived last night marks another step
in the effort to maintain or revive worthwhile
traditions. The affair was plainly a huge sues
cess, and is a step which is to be highly recom-
mended.

Those who attended the dinner could not
help but be impressed by obvious sincerity of the
various speakers who pointed out the real need
for a closer and more intimate relationship be-
tween the senior and other classes, especially the
sophomores.

The tradition is undoubtedly a worthy one,
and one which was well worth the effort needed
to retrieve it from the ash heap where it had been
deposited in previous years. For this achieve.
ment the class of ’37 deserves great credit, and es.
pecially the committee members who worked so
industriously to make the affair a success. Worth.
while traditions are always an asset to any cam-
pus, and the sophomore class is to be congratu-
lated upon a successful revival of something
which is of great benefit to the campus now and
will continue to be so in the future.

1936 ELECTION PROSPECTS

The Republican party in its New England rally,
and the United States Chamber of Commerce in
its annual convention at Washington D. C. both
recently came out with a definite expression of
opposition to the New Deal administration. Since
these two organizations have by tradition become
accustomed to reflect the sentiment of “big busi—
ness,” it seems that an open break has occurred
between the administration and organized Am-
erican business. Spokesmen at the Republican
rally and the Chamber of Commerce convention
sharply denounced New Deal measures and plans,
especially those which affect government—busi—
ness relations. At the Chamber’s ﬁnal session
Thursday, a set of resolutions were voted through
opposing all but one of the legislative measures
which the President proposed in his Sunday night
“fireside chat.” Opposition was expressed to the
utility holding company legislation which would
outlaw holding companies which the government
deems “unnecessary;” to the omnibus banking
bill which would extend the government's control
over the nation’s credit system; to the extension
of the NRA in its present form; to the lowering
of tariffs in reciprocal trade agreements; and to
the immediate passage of social security bill.

With this latest development in the political
situation, it seems safe to do a hit of predicting
for the 1936 presidential election. Though Mr.
Roosevelt may soften his legislative program in
the face of this pronounced criticism, it seems
unlikely that he will abandon it to a sufficient ex—
tent to suit organized business. It seems no less
improbable that business will move from its pres-
ent stand, for its recently expressed sentiments
have been in formation for some time, and now
are crystallized into a definite, organized oppos-
ition to the president’s program. Since the Re-
publican party has, by tradition, represented busi-
ness interests and reflected business sentiment, it
can be expected to support the present attitude of
organized business and to oppose the libérality of a
second Democratic administration and the fur»
Lhering of the social and economic refroms which
Roosevelt has introduced.

In short the 1936 election will be contested by
a strong party in power and a rejuvenated opposi-
tion party. Its issues will be primarily economic
and socialma struggle between the establishment
of new social and economic conceptions and the
maintainence of elder, more firmly entrenched
and more familiar policies. The outcome, only
time can tell.

Scientific research is the quest for
truth, which places little weight on
practical value or financial pmfit, but
seeks the extension of human
knowledge, stated Harry w. Norris.
professor of zoology, in chapel Mon.
day. -

Dr. Norris gave as an example of
true research the use of the microscope
in the fifteenth century, purely for
cniuyment. Genus which cause dis.
case were found in this investigation.
“And so they discovered that death
is not a mysterious manifestation of
providence,” he continued.

Research proceeds through observa.
tion of facts, not through lucky guess.
es, Dr. Norris declared. He concluded
by quoting from the Bible, “Ye know
the truth and the truth shall make
you free.”

After we had finished reading Mr.
I. H. Hoover‘s book on his 42 year
reign as Majoredomo at the White
House, we asked ourselves the ques.
lion as to whether a busy student
would be justified in spending some
of his valuable time in reading a book
which has little historic value. We
decided that for us at least it had
succeeded in making personalities of
the hitherto merely historic figures
of the presidents. It touched our
imagination and filled out a picture
which had. previously merely been a
skeleton structure of factual, informa.
tion. That, we feel, is the chief con.
tribution this soacalled light reading
can make to one’s general background;
it tells in terms of human struggle the
things which we, studying them as
we do with a scholarly detachment
from the emotions that have always
colored human existence, do not ap—
proach unless it be through this av.
cone of voluntary endeavor. The
rental shelf of the college library
will serve to introduce you to this
fascinating and probably neglected
part of your education.

FORTY-TWO YEARS IN THE
WHITE HOUSE, ‘by I. H. Hoover. As
chief usher of the White House, “Ike"
Hoover observed ten presidents and
their families at close range. He com.
mean frankly on their personalities,
habits and foibles and all the intimate
details of their daily life.

Those who like intimate portraits
of the nation’s rulers will find keen
delight, as well as interesting informa.
tion, in this unique volume. While
the author is frank, yet at the same
time he exercises a certain restraint,
indicating that he was not unmindful
that he was dealing with those who
had played leading parLs on the stage
of American political life

How much of all this is one to
believe? One doubts, without guess
tioning “Ike” Hoover’s veracity in the
least, that the chief usher was in
every instance as familiar with the
affairs of the White House as he
claims. To this reviewer, the accouns
of Wilson’s illness and his break with
Colonel House seem cthc only' con.
tributions to history because both
events have hitherto been very in.
completely explained. Nevertheless,
we enjoy gossip if it seems no more
scandalous than the facts warrant, and
we feel that “Ike” Hoover has made
a contribution, however slight, to re.
cent American history.

MEN NEVER KNOW, by Vicki
Baum. Vicki Baum employs a rather
novel technique in this latest novel.
Evelyn Droste, wife of a German
judge, falls in love with a young
American, and leaves her home in
Berlin to follow him to Paris. Tho
story, which covers only four days.
relates the events of each day, as these
appear- to the American, to 'Evclyn,
and to Evelyn's husband.

A sordid murder mystery and a
romantic triangle love story are rather
deftly entangled in the making of
Men Never Know. The book is long
on suspense and is calculated to hold
the reader’s interest. We feel its
feminine readers will thomughly en.
joy its lush sentimentalism.

our pioneers," She compared the time
when Mrs. Haines attended GrinneII
college, in the reconstruction period
after the Civil war, to the present
age.

“We need to remember our obliga.
tion to the past and keep the vision
of the future," Miss Andersen con.
cluded.

it educated men refuse to accept
the burdens of society and govern.
ment, others will take them up, Fred.
crick L. Baumann, associate professor
of history, declared in chapel Thurs.
day. He advocated the study of
social sciences as a means of under.
standing our complicated society.

”But knowledge alone is not
enoug he said. “Men must be will.
ing to accept the responsibilities of
society." He stated that cultured peo.
ple weigh each activity for its worth
before investing their time in it.

“Man alone without his cultural
inheritance is worth little," Mr. Bau—
mann declared. “He must know the
past to appreciate the present."

”Although machines are lessening
the weight of the natural world," he
said, “they are increasing that of the
social world by making it more com.
plex."

Mr. Eaurnann declared that it is the
nature of human energy to become
crystallized into institutions. It is on.
ly through study, he said. that we
can evaluate these institutions accord.
