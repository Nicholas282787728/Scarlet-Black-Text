14 Pioneer Trackmen
to Compete at Ames

(Continued From Page 1).

douw mntitor, due ta an injured
knee, which, according to reports, has
torced him to cease_compcting for the
balance of the track season.

in the hurdles, iierce competition
will also be encountered by the scar:
let and black runners. Three out.
standing men have been entered in
the meet—Clark oi Grinnell, Phillips,
'l\llsa, and Philson, Drake. Clark beat
Philson in the Drake dual meet and
should be able to repeat his victory
in the meet Friday, Duke believes.
Whether or not Clark can defeat Phil—
lips, Tulsa star, in the high hurdles, is
aquestion. Phillips has been timed in
14.9 in the highs earlier this year,
and may turn another record breaking
time Friday. However, he has slipped
rapidly since that time, and failed to
qualh’y in the highs at the Drake re,
lays held in April.

Gordon May Win

Gordon, in the two mile run, should
place high, according to Duke, al—
though he will have to battle it out
with Mahannah oi Drake. They will
clash for the third time this year,
Friday night. with the honors so tar
evenly divided, each having won one
race, Mahannah anexod the confer.
cncc indoor title, while Gordon turn.
ed the tables in the dual meet here
two weeks ago. The Bulldog star
turned in the time oi 9:43,, last week
to prove that he is still a threat in
that event. Gordon ran the distance
in 9:453 in the Carleton dual Friday
and will have to turn in a faster time
to defeat the Bulldog star.

The mile relay team is almost a sure
winner and should he able to break
the conference record of 3:198 estab-
lisher by the University of Illinois in
1918. The mile quartet has twice
stepped the distance in less than 3:20
and if conditions are favorable should
lower the existing mark by several
seconds.

Bentley Injured

The loss oi Don Bentley, who
has been out at competition for
the last week and a half due to an in-
jured knee, will hurt the chances oi
the BSD-yard relay team placing, Duke
said. Bentley is capable of running
on either use 880 or the mile relay
teams, and his loss will mean the
weakening oi one of the teams due to
the shifting of the men.

The fifteen scarlet and black run.
ne‘rs will arrive in Tulsa Thursday
afternoon in time to take a workout
at the Skelly stadium. Friday night,
after the meet, they will immediately
entrain ior Grim-tell, arriving here late
Saturday aitemoun.

Following is the list ot men who
left this afternoon: Anderson, Arnold,
Bair, Barnes, Bradley, Clark, Gordon,
Hagen, Knapheide, McAlister, Mo.
Klveen, McMurray, Mason, Meeter and
Parzybok.

American Colleges Still
40 Years Behind Times

Miami, Fla, (ACP)——American col.
logos are "teaching 40 years behind the
times instead at 10 years ahead," B.
H. narrow ot Columbus, Ohio, national
chairman ior radio, told the National
Congress oi parents and Teachers here
recently.

“The school is behind the times that
doesn't use newspapers and the ‘radic
along with text books," Mr. Darrow
declared. This is a tabloid age and
to teach etiectively, we must use mod—
ern agencies oi the era that is highly
visual and auditory minded," he sat .

"The study oi the past is a poo-.-
academic process unless it makes the4
student interpret the present. Only
the schools that have stopped covering
the students over with the dust of
dead things and are giving them cur—
rent events have the beginning oi self.
education." Mr. Darrow pointed out. '
