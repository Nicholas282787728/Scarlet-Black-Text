Great Campus Turmoil

authorities admitted that Mcars had
a clean record.

Linked with Light Episode
A possible connection between
the disappearance of the wall
lights from Mears parlors last winter
and the missing piano led to the as—
sumption that someone was furnishing
a home at the expense of the college.
The engaged couples questioned de-
nied it emphatically, and besides, nei—
ther of them could play a piano.
After an hour of examination, Ralph
Wise admitted having been in biology
lab all semester without once suspect-

 

ing that a piano was nearby.
Searching Party Organized

A search party led by the grounds
superintendent finally tracked down
the missing instrument. it was found
resting quietly in its accustomed place
in the north half of the Y building
In less than an hour, thc disappointed
crowds dispersed and the Music de-
lartment gave lorih peals of joy.

A last minute inquiry showed that the
inventory checker had found the south
side of the Y building, only. Inasmuch
as the north end of the building
is practically the same as the south
end, and that one end looks like the
other to persons m a hurry, and that
the south end is better known by
reason of in social advantages, it is no
wonder that the piano was mislnid,
Most people would have difficulty in
finding two pia‘ncs in such a large
building.

For us: ln similar cases in the fu-
ture, we recommend a ad in the Lost
column of the S & B (adv)

LOST. One uprighteous piano, Model
1510, in good condition. Has initials
F. G. carved on back, and a blister on
the left foot. Answers to the name,
Betty. If found, please return. All
is forgiven. No questions asked.
