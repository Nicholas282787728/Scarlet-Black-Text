a squad oi special police headed by

Sargent Delivers
Annual Address
at Senior Chapel

“A Parable ior Seniors," illustrating
the diiiicultics and unknown val.
ues oi discipline, was the subject oi
the talk given by Louisa Sargent. as—
sist’ant proiessor oi botany, at the
annual senior convocation yesterday
moming.

Basing the parable upon two years
oi her childhood spent at the home
at her austere and puritanical grand.
parents, she explained, that college
training was much the same .and that
many oi the things learned would
constitute the foundation upon which
later careers were to be built.

“Your incomparable years oi col.
lege are now builded into the iounda.
tion that makes your past. What ei—
icct they have upon yourvunknown
iuture, you can never iully know.

What their disciplines, denials, dis-
appointments and delights have ac—
complished you may never see except
in a glass darkly. But something has
been iashioned; may it ever prove
worthy and strong; and may the tem.
ple rising upon it be even moie noble
and signiiicant and satisiylng. she can-
