Lavell Presents Address
at Vespers Last Sunday

Although not all doubt leads to in—
quiry but often leads to dogmatism,
"doubt and confusion are signs of
montai healt stated Cccii F. Lavell,
professor of history of thought, at Ves-
pars Sunday. All those who think in
these days are in doubt, he continued,
and “we are consequently in an in.
teiiectual mess.”

“Some, however, have no time for

when you know what to do with it,
for “when the voice of reason is
silenced, the rattle of machine guns
begins.” in this amazing world of to.
day, one needs patience, [or men have
learned to distrust quick remedies.

“In the last hundred yetrs we have
found not only machine pcwcr, but
we have found one another." Yet
the distracting thing in this generation
is that although so many of the
ctcrnal things have become clearer.
people are more puzzled than ever
before and they doubt more readily.

“Remember, however," concluded
Professor Lavcll, “it is the number of
things men don‘t know but are look.
ing for that makes them better than
apes."
