Des Moines. 1a,, Nov. 1 (Spec-
iall—The Bear-s from Washington
university. who won the champion-
ship last year, Saturday will open
their drive for a second straight
Missouri Valley conference football
title with an at-home date against
Creighton

Before the season opened Wash-
ington was rated the standout fav-
orite to repeat, but in non-
conference games against pow-
erful teams the Bears have
failed to measure up to
last year's standard. As a result,
Jimmy Conzelman's boys are only
slightly favored to beat a Creigh-
ton team which has been hard hit
by injuries and ineligibility.

‘ Jays Barely Win

Last week the crippled Jays
managed to score late in the game
and Matt Bckmueller booted the
extra point to spoil Grinnell's
Homecoming, 7-6. The victory left
Creighton unbeaten in three valley
games, although its record is mar-
red by a 6-6 tie with Drake, wash-
ington last Saturday absorbed a
47-13 heating at the hands of
Michigan State.

Meanwhile, Tulsa jumped into
the Valley driving seat with a well
earned 12-0 victory over its state
and conference rival, OklahomaA.
to M. Only a game with Drake
stands between the Golden Hurri-
cane ahd at least a tie for the
league title in its first season as a
member,

Tulsa Moets Kansas State

Tulsa is at home to Kansas State
of the Big Six this Saturday, while
the Cowboys play at Lubbock,
Tera, against Texas Tech. Wash,
burn, back from the Pacific coast
where it found Gonzaga too strong,
21-0, faces the Haskell Indian whom
:Drake trimmed last week. 21-0.

Plenty of color is assured here
when Drake and Grinnell clash in
the Bulldog Homecoming. Rivalry
between the two schools is the old-
est in the valley. Drake is a slight
favorite.

Lynn Schlotterbeek of Grinnell
and doe Kalil of Tulsa, two small
but elusive halfbacks, scored
touchdowns Saturday to tie for the
individual scoring leadership of the
conference with 12 points apiece.
Capt. Tack Dennis of Tulsa is
next with seven.

I, c 24: U. S. I. 0. Thus read
the scoreboard aftci- Iowa college,
now Grinnell, and the state Uni-l
versity of Iowa had played the
first football game ever played
west of the Mississippi. away back‘
in 1889. l

This game was the result of;
Iowa college accepting the Univer-
sity's open challenge to any team
willing to play them, According;
to the "News Letter." a bl—weckly‘
publication, forerunner of the Scar-
let and Black. one Iowa university
fan made the statement before the
game that they were out “to bag
a few of our cornfield canaries"

Hard to Read Accounts

Due to the style in which the
game is written up, it is hard to
interpret just what did happen
during the course of play. About
the only intelligible portion is one
which describes the Scarlet and
Black line locking arms when the
University had the ball on the I,
cr's 5vyard line, and thus halting
the drive.

The following season the I, c.
players added another game to
their schedule, by playing the Uni-
versity of Minnesota as well as the
University of Iowa, Minnesota tri-
umphed, 13-14, by scoring the win-
ning touchdown in the final min-
utes of play. The Grinnellians
again whipped Iowa. this time by
a score of 13-6,

Interesting Comments

In the write-up of the 1390 game
with Iowa were several interesting
comments: “Lyon, about to down
Sampson, is himself knocked down
by a blow across the breast, which
the umpire didn’t see, and Pooley
is hit in the head by Powers, prohv
ably accidentally, Blood flows free-
ly,”

In 1591 Iowa college tied Min-
nesota 12-12, whipped Iowa, 6- ,
and then lost to Minnesota 22-14
in a second game between the
schools. At the end of the sea-
son, a comment appeared in the
“News Letter" to the effect that
three games were not enough in
one season and that more games
should be scheduled.

First Full Schedule

The 1392 season was the first in
which the locals played a full
schedule. They won four games
and lost two during the season.
Minnesota defeated them 40-24,
while Iowa university defeated
them for the first time, by an 18-
12 count. In one game I. 0 took
the measure of the Des Moines
Y. M, c. A. team, 132-0, while the
second team defeated the Cornell
varsity. 42-0.

The following year
defeated Ames, 36-6,
36-14, while losing to
36-6.

the locals
and Iowa,
Minnesota.

Beat Amos

In 1894 I. c. opened the season
with a 14-5 win over Ames. The
average weight of the Ames team
was 172 pounds, while the locals
averaged 158. In the second game,
they defeated Simpson, 54-0. A
headline in the Scarlet and Black
read thus, "Hundreds witness
Game." In the body of the story it
was stated that there were about
650 persons present.

Later in the season the team

 

‘the I. (1 boys

llet and Black team

 

beat Doane, 5-4, and on the fol
lowing day bowed to the Universi-
ty of Nebraska, 22-0. The weather
was so hot that the quarters were
shortened to 25 minutes.
Defaulted to Iowa

In the final game of the season
defaulted to the
University, 6-0. The locals were
leading at the time they defaulted.
According to the Scarlet and Black
what happened was this: “Darby
(an I. 0, back) stole the ball and
ran for a touchdown, but the ref-
ercc rulcd the ball down where
Darby stole it, although he neither
blew his whistle nor saw the
play," After this incident the Scar-
rcfuscd to
continue.

The Gi-innellians opened the 1395
scason with a 6-4 win over llliune

,sota, but in the next game lost to

Doane 6-0 on the Grinnell field. It
was the first grid game that the
local team had lost at home, and
caused no end of consternation
Iowa refused to play the I. c.
boys, and for the fourth year out
of six. I. c. was declared state
champion.
