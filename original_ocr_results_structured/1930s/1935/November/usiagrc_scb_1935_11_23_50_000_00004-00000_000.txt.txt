THE CROSSROADS

As the discussion of the present
Griuucll athletic crisis continues to
rage on the campus, one great incl
seems to become more and more
apparent. It is the fact that Grirr
llell college, as far as its athletic
policy of the future is concerned, is
at the crossroads

A challgejl'l the athletic depart-
ment seems desirable and with this
change, if it comes, will also have
to come a realization that Griimcll
cannot continue its athletic poli-
cies us in the past. The records of
the past few years point irrefutabr
ly to this conclusion. Mixed var-
sity sport schedules in which both
strong and weak opponents have
been played, have resulted in disas-
ter in the majority of the cases,
and Grinnell many times has been
so weakened after playing schools
out of its class, as to be unable to
defeat schools of its own as or
weaker. Now what to do in the
future?

Three courses of notion seem to
be before Grinncll, One course is to
abandon the idea of cndcovoring to
compete in the Missouri Valley con.

.ference nith schools which have
enrousuents i‘rom loo to several
thousand larger than Grinllell. If
this is done Grinnell might join the
Mid-west conference composed of
schools of approximately the same
siml if this is done Grillneu will
admit the presentset-up is wrong,
a matter which everyone seems to
accept as such now. ’

‘A second course would be to go
in for athletics in a big way. Extrll
special efforts should be made to
get good athletes here, and thus
build up winning teams which
could compete in the Missouri Vale
ley conference and with perhaps
other big schools as well. Call this
subsidizlltiou if you will, navel-then
less it must be admitted that it is
being done all over the country,
and if Grinllell is going to attempt
to play “big time" football, then a
similar policy must be followed.

The third method is to abandon
varsity sports entirely, and in»
stead, rely upon an extension of
the present illtrnmllrlll athletic
program to provide sports in a
manner similar to ‘the English idea
This would, of course, mean that
students would no longer be at-
trr'wted to Grinnell because of Wu”
sily sports, although serious doubt
as to the effectiveness of this ap-
pesl in the last few years is quite
natural. _

Three murses lie before Grillllell.
In which direction Hill We go?
That is the que. ion and there can
be no better time than now to set—
tle this question. Perhaps a Coopers
ative attempt by the ivlmillisfrlk
tion, the students mill the alumni
can solve this problem. The prob—
lem exists. \Vhich road will we fol»
low? That must be solved soon.

Dear Mr. Huhn.

We feel that when you ask a question you want
an answer. Last Wednesday you asked in your edi-
torial, “What is the Matter with GrinneII’I” Wc'do
not propose to set ourselves up in the position of or»
soles who know all the answers. We merely wish to
present an angle of the question that you sccm to
have overlookcd. The newspapers print only what
the people want, supposedly, but it is our belief that
our campus newspaper has over-rstcppcd its bounds
and voiced an opinion not generally acccpted as it is
presented in the editorial. »

During the, years that we have been on the
squad it has been the habit of the team to clasp
hands in a huddle just before the opening- kickoff
and repeat in unison an old proverb, “a winner ncvcr
quits and a quitter never wins." Thcre was a time
when the Crinnell Lei-1m meant every word of that
proverb, but lately it has becomc a habit and noth-
ing- else. In other words, Mr. Hunn, We think you
have overlooked the broken morale of the squad as
a factor in the Pioneer's poor record of the lflst few
games. The Grinncll team does not need to hang its
head in shame because of the result of any of this
year's tilts save these last ones. This year's sched-
ule has not been an easy oneiplaying only one
school smaller than ourselves and winning that one
decisively, We played several our own size to this
date winning one, tying one, and losing one,

i'here are sevel'al things that have contributed
to the situation as it now stands. Grinncll, in the
first place, is a school that admittedly dc-empha-
sizes intercollegiale athletics. There is absolutely no
effort made to induce prep athletes to attend Grin-
nell. This necessarily means that Grinnell will have
small athletic squads. Small squads are not the
fault of the coaches. You may say that Grinnell
had a large squad reporting in September this year.
True, there were about 35 men reported, but only 18
or 20 of these men were Missouri valley calibre,
When a large squad of these 18 or 20 men are in-
jured the morale of the squad suffers.

You charged, Mr, Hunn, that Criunell's squad
was built around one man. We ask you if there is
any alternative when there is only one man suited
to Grinnell's system? Only one man because of the
poor attitude displayed by the understudies of this
man. You asked in your editorial why certain re-
serves had ceased to report for practice. One man
turned in his suit because he felt he should devote
more time to his studies. others quit because they
felt that they were not getting a “bel'ak” by being
withheld from gamerplay. In this respect we woulo
point out that Grinnell's margin of vicory, or defeat,
in the games up to the Coe game was so small that
it necessarily precluded any wholesale substitution

You state, Mr. Hunn, that you are at a loss to
explain the reason why Grinneii teams display such
poor blocking and tackling. We do not believe that
Grinnell teams tackle and block poorly because they
do not know how to execute these fundamentals. If
a man does not like to block bond and tackle vicious-
ly there is no amount of practice that can make him
like it. In other words, there are very few men on
the Grinncll squad who really want to play football.
We have been hiding behind the coaching staff long
enough. We have been content to dodge the great-
est portion of the blame and~criticism and let it be
absorbed by an undefended target. We have not met
the coaches half way.

We do believe, though, that you have hit the
real crux of the problem in your last paragraph,
wherein you state, “If the administration does not
want teams that can win in strong competition, if
thc policy of the school is to be one of nonrcoopcl‘a-
tion with the athletic department. then we had bet-
ter begin booking junior colleges.“ We believe that
it is time Crinnell either got into intercollegiate
athletics whole hog or none

Dear Editor:

The Scarlet and Black is to be congratulated
for printing (and thus bringing Lo 3 head) the sent
timcnt that has prevailed on the Grinnell campus
this year. Tire reason Grinnell has maintained such
a low winning percentage during the last eight years
may no blamed upon a number of things, but wheth—
cr in dcfcat or victory, is there any excuse for the
execution of the fundamentals of football boLh on
and ofi the game field?

Football, though a rough and hard game,_ re
quires just as much finish as writing, playing a mu-

 

sical instrument, or playing basketball; and the only

way technique can be acquired is by practice, Does
the Grinncll football team show technique in block-
ing and tackling? They have plenty of practice:
But it appears that Lhey do not have the practice
on the proper things, namely, blocking and tack-
hng, It isn't that the players don't know how to do
these things. it's just that they've been out of high
school for several years and are somewhat ragged
in the execution of this knowledge.

There has been considerable talk about the spir—
it of Grinnell, How can this be kept alive in the
face of such humiliation before other schools? The
tcam needs inspiration, confidence, and most of an,
a winning spirit within themselves. Inspiration is
the rrsult of some outside action on the feelings of
the players, and where is the logical place for this
inspiration to originate? The answer is quite obr
dons,

Also, the player gains confidence by knowing
he can do something. If he has no confidcnce in
himself or his teammates, he has already lost thc
game, confidence could bc obtumcd by constant pl'aar
tice on the fundamentals. And finally, the winning
spirit is the outgrowth of the two preceding quali-
ties. The desire to win is not found on a losing
team. A little psychology instead of scrimmage
would help swing the margin of victory toward
Grinnell.

To the Editor:

The front page editorial carried in the Wednes-
day issue of the Scarlet and Black merits discussion
on the port of Grinncll students and faculty.

Being one of a large number of persons on the
campus interested in our present football situation,
i investigated the record made by Grinnell teams fr
the last nine years, The results may be revealing

During this time Grlnnell has won 25 games.
Twelve of these victories came at the expense of
schools whose brand of football is presumably of
poorer quality than Grinncll's. I refer to such
schools as Penn, Iowa State Teachers, Cornell, and
Central.

Dun'l-lg this time Grinncll has lost 36‘ games,
four of them being to such minor schools. Seventeen
of our losses have been in Missouri Valley competi-
ticu. Ten of them have been to large schools such as
Wisconsin, Michigan state, Minnesota, Nebraska
and Iowa State,

In addition, during this time, Grinnell has tied
11 games, five being to minor schools. ' ,

No one should have any kick coming when we
are defeated by teams of Big Ten and Big Six calr
iber.

Can anyone ascertain the reason for our disas-
trous record? Who is to blame.7 It is the easiest
to lay the trouble at the feet of the coach. Perhaps,
he is at fault. Perhaps, the blame should go to the
different athletic boards representing the school dur
ing the last nine years. Perhaps, the blame should
go to the football players themselves, as some of
them seem to think. Perhaps, it should go to the
student body. Perhaps, it should go to the college
administration which falls utterly in placing proper
emphasis on Grinnell athletics,

According to sentiment, not only of students
and alumni, but of people throughout and beyond
the borders of Iowa. Crinnell needs, and needs bad-
ly, a shake-up in its athletic department.

The Scarlet and Black is L0 be praised for its
courageous stand.

LETTERS To THE EDITOR
To the Editor of the Scarlet and Black:

This campus has been aroused by the strong
editorial which appeared in last Wednesday's issue
of the Scarlet and Black. Not only has the cam-
pus been aroused, but this fact has been carried to
the sport shoots of many of the papers of the state

Some students have branded this article as unr
timely and unfair, while others have uphold it, and
believe that it has brought to light the tho ght
which has dominated the student football opi ion
for the past two years. Those students who are
condemning the author of the ”truth" seem to be
those who are “benefitting” by that fault exposed by
that editorial.

When a student spirit drops as has Gl'iimell's
since early in the season, when the team seems dead
on the field, when the players have not been taught
fundamentals and have lost their fight, which they
had, due‘to lack of stimulation on the part of the
coach, something must be done and it should be donc
right now, The defense which has bccn put up is
that injuries have caused the downfall of the squad,
that the crack passer is in the hospital. This is all
true, but no cosch should build his team around one
man or two or three men because of the injury post
sibility,

Question: What action do you
think should be taken in regard
to the present athletic situation?

r r «

Subsidize athletics, then give the
athletes a break Whllé they're here

cause of the slump,

Evidently something is wrong
with the present athletic setup.
If it is the administration, then
they should change their attitude.
If it is the coaching staff, then
they should be changed,

so.

I believe that, in view of the
record for the past nine years, a
now coaching staff should be in—
stalled. In addition Crinnoll should
undertake to keep Iowa athletic
ability in Iowa, by subsidizing our
own state prospects.
~Milton Blaul '39.

I think that Grinnell needs a new
coaching staff to improve the re-
sults of Grinnell football teams.
As far as the actual system of
plays in Ilse now are concerned,
they are excellent in their purpose.
The fault lies in the fact that the
players are not capable of execut~
lug these plays with the proper
blocking tactics. Also. the play-
ers are woefully weak on the fine
points of defensive tactics. This
casts no reflection on the players
themselves; it is the-fault cf the
coaching system which stresses
only offense. The coaches have not
the ability to teach the fine points
of defense which enable a player to.
play the game better. This is not
fair to the fellows who have played
on the team for three years and
have never felt the enjoyment of
a successful season. It is my sin-
cere opinion that when the joy goes
out of any game, the game should
cease to be played. Rather than
ask follows to practice long hours,
rather than drop football,the school
should secure a new coaching staff
which win provide that quality
which the present staff lacks.

v—iJames Stiles '39.

r r s

College football has developed to

the point where it is necessary to
have more than a coach for the
line and one for the backfield.
Grinnell competes against schools
that have a coaching staff of three
or four assistants. The added in-
struction by this larger staff
makes their blocking and tackling
more consistent than ours, The ad-
dition of an assistant or two to
our present Staff would improve
our athletic situation to a marked
degree, However, this alone would
not suffice. Grinnell must extend
itself more than it has in the past
in obtaining satisfactory material
with which to build its teams. Our
public relations department has
neglected to uscll'l Grinneil to ath-
letes who have some desire of
matriculating here. They merely
stand by and let other colleges get
the cream of the crop.
