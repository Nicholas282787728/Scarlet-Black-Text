ON THE UP AND UP

There have been rumors abroad through-
out the country that the famous corner,
around which Prosperity has lurked for the
past five years, was actually being turned,
However that may be, Grinnell college is def-
initely continuing on the up grade, This past
year saw the largest increase in our enroll-
ment in any single year in Grinnell history.
Another substantial increase is in sight for the
year just ahead. In fact, awaiting list for
both men and women is in immediate pros-
pect, even with the addition of supplementary
living accommodations. The “Annex” oppos<
ite the quadrangle (now occupied by Dean
Beatty‘s family) will be opened for a group
of women, and the large and handsome res-
idence recently acquired from Mr. Jesse Fel-
lows, at the north end of Broad street, facing
Merrill Park, is being equipped for a group
of 20 men.

With regard to this latter acquisition, we
are planning a new experiment in training
for citizenship. We propose to select, as resi—
dents of this new hall, 20 men who are par—
ticularly interested in public service, to have
living with them a director (and his wife)
who will give courses in sociology and also
direct the practical work of both men and
women so interested, in public and community
service, in the town and in the rural district
about Grinnell.‘ The work of this type al—
ready done by Grinnell students adn recent
graduates will thus be better organized and
supervised and much extended. In this way
our students will be better prepared than
ever for active and efficient parti patjon in
public service and the duties of citizenship.

The 1935 Commencement was in many rer
spects the best ever within the memory of the
oldest grad. There was a record attendance
of alumni and friends, and the participation
of former President Dan F. Bradley, of our
Washington headliners Chester Davis and
Harry Hopkins, and of the Chinese Ambassa-
dor Sao-Ke Alfred Sze, lent especial dise
tinction to the occasion. During the two
weeks that followed the campus was crowded
with conference folk: the Congregational
Young People's conference had a record at-
tendance of 420, and the first Summer Insti-
tute of International Relations brought over
200 delegates to Grinnell.

The quad Women will open their eyes
when they enter Main hall on their return
to Grinnell, The central drawing room is
being completely refinished, redecorated and
refurnished, and similar changes are being
made in the entrance through Mears; all this
under the personal direction of Mr. Hartsook
of Younker Bros, Des Moines, 1a. More than

ever the quadrangle will serve as an example
of good taste and dignity in college living.

To the new men and women who will be-
gin their career as Grinnell students during
Freshman Days we extend the heartiest weln
come to the privileges and duties of college
life. They will find here a tradition of liberty
with responsibility, of hard work and whole-
some recreation, of complete democracy with
plentiful opportunities for leadership. May
they all prove Worthy of citizenship ill our
academic community!

AN INTRODUCTION

With this issue of the Scarlet and Black
are introduced several changes, which, per.
haps, justly so, might be termed radical. Most
outstanding of these changes are the reduc»
tion of the paper from an unwieldy four page,
six column to a five column, six page tabloid
size; the introduction of a new head schedule
which will enable a greater variety to be
achieved in make-up; and the decision to de-
partmentaljze to some degree the work of
gathering and writing the news of the cam-
pus.

The first two innovations, which represent
departures from the more conservative paths
of journalism, were decided upon by the
management as the result of a study of the
trends in college journalism. The idea of a
tabloid paper is not new, and many college
papers have adopted it. The leading expon-
ent of the idea is the Daily Northwestern,
published at. Northwestern university.

Believing that the tabloid lends itself
more readily to the needs of the average
college newspaper and because of the admit-
ted greater ﬂexibility, the change was made.
In the future it is hoped that the decision will
facilitate the changing of the paper from a six
to an eight page affair, with the minimum
amount of difficulty and printing expense.

Not only does the tabloid size give great—
er ﬂexibility as to increasing or decreasing
the size of the paper, but it also enables a
greater display and division to be given to
the various advertisements. Thus the busi-
ness staff is benefited and the individual mer—
chants receives more for each advertising dole
dar he spends. The actual amount of space
is but a few inches less than the old size.

The new head style, technically known as
the “flush left hand schedule," is no revolu—
tionary conception in college journalism. This
style is becoming increasingly popular due to
the greater degree of variety which it imparts
to the front page, and the ease with which
most of the heads can be written, thus elim-
inating most of the time wasting labor so
often connected with the work of preparing
copy for the printer.

The “flush left hand schedule" has been
used on such papers as the Oberlin Review,
the Iowa State Student and the Columbia Uni-
Jersity Spectator, leading colle e newspapers.
The trend towards this type headline has
become increasingly apparent, and since the
Scarlet and Black seeks to be progressive,
the management adopted the schedule.

The work of departmentalizing the paper
has not. been completed as yet, but it is hop-
ed that the paper will be subdivided in order
to facilitate the gathering of the news. Prob-
ably three general departments will be cre—
atedesports, society and feature They will
be under the supervision of an editor who
will be responsible for the gathering of the
news in their respective department.

This issue of the paper is more or less of
an experimental one, and perhaps some of 'the
ideas which have been displayed here will
be abandoned, but nevertheless the manage-
ment of the paper believes that if it is to
carry on the tradition of progressiveness on
the paper, it can best achieve the ideal by
striving to give the student body a paper
which embodies the best and newest in col-
lege journalism and yet provdies adequate
coverage of the campus news.

By increasing their grade point
average by .22 of a point, Rawson
hall scholars captured scholarship
honors for the second half of the
second semester, displacing Clark
men who had held first place
at mid—semester, according to the
figures compiled by the office of
the dean of men.

The two leading halls were fol.
lowed by Smith with an average
of 1:31; Langan, 1'35, Gates and
Pioneer, both 129; and Dibble,
126.

Hall Residents Lead

Rawson likewise lead in the
grade point average for the hall
residents, having an average of 1.66,
followed by Clark with 1.4 ' Gates,
1.37; Dibble, 1:35; Smith, ; Lan-
gan, 1.31; and Pioneer 129.

Clark associates, however, main—
tamed a 2.0 average to take first
place away from the Rawson men
who had an averge of 1.74. The
two leaders were followed by
Smith with 1.57; Langan, 1.50;
Gates, .99; and Dibble, .88. The
Pioneer hall. had no asaciates and
was not included in these computa-
lions.

norm Average 1.39

The men living in the dormitor-
ies as a whole compiled an average
of 1.39, while all of the town men
achieved an average of 1.34.

This was the first time that the
grades of the Pioneer residents
were figured separately as a unit.
Previously the grades of men had
been computed with those of the
hall with which they were as,-
sooiated.

Gates Assessed
Lowest Damage Rate

Gates hall with a prorata dam—
age charge of 10 cents per man

 

has the lowest individual hall
charge made within the last four
years. However, the dormitory
average, whida this year also in-
cludes Pioneer hall, was higher
than the average charge made last
year, according to the Treasurer's
office.

The dormitory average charge
this year was 37 cents, while the
charge last year was 32 and one
half cents,

Ranking behind Gates were Dib-
tale with an average charge or 20
cents, Rawson, 30 cents; Clark, 45
cents; Smith, so cents; Pioneer, so
cents: and Langan, 55 cents.
