ANALYZE YOURSELF

Are you all aveldge person? If you are
you do not have much chance of being a she
cess in the modern business World.

In a recent: survey of 40,000 traveling sales
men, it was found that there was an annual
turnover o‘f 85%. This is usually attributed to
the fact that the majority of salesmen are mt
erage or below. Thus one may easily draw the
conclusion, that unless he is above average he
does not have much chance of being it success
ful salesman

There ale several plans which may he fol-
lowed in an attempt to overcome this phenom-
enon. One of the best ways is to learn to study.
Learn to grasp things quickl ledln how to
obtain facts in the shortest possible tillle- lealll
all you can about the business or profession
which you hope to enter Above all mquile
the idea of giving selvice, not the idea of get-
ting all you can for nothing.

If you cannot oveldolne this handicap, ell-
ter the field which is lnost suited to you, if you
enjoy it, Financial success does not mean lmpr
piness. If you give service find find happiness

_ you are as successful as one may hope to be.

Analyze yourself. Find out as early as
possible the field which suits you hesl, ‘thell do
us much as possible to did yourself ill your
chosen work. Do not go through college, blillfl
ly. Set a goal llllil then Stll\e to attain it But
do not become Minded to oppollunitios “hil'll
limv bidncll oft fiom yonl chosen field.

Other Opinions

NONE or This ROSE BOWL STUFF
(Washington Student Life, St. Louis)

The editors of the Princeton newspaper have
decided pretty conclusively that they don‘t want. to
send their boys out to the Rose Bowl. This is a
dandy idea, and Student Life has decided not to
let Washington go, cilhcr. What they’re going to
do for two teams on New Year’s day, hesven only
knows.

This Rose Bowl thing, says Princeton, is simply
making a dirty professional business out of football,
which is properly a gentleman's sport, played by
amateurs. When they have games up at Princeton
they just invite c few close friends and faculty
members, never more than seventy-five thousand,
The fellows all chip in five or 10 dollars apiece be
fore the game to pay for the referees and the foot-
balls. That way they don’t have to worry about pro-
fessional athletes.

Here at Washington, where we're likely be have
literally hundreds of people buying tickets. we can't
be so idesllscic, snd if we've got to play ball with
the professionals, why okay, if We get our out. No,
sir. the reason we won't go is the Rocky Mountains,
and besides that, the Great American Desert, and
we don’t care if Princeton knows it, either.

ANTIQUATED SENSE OF POLITICAL VALUES.
(Daily Northwestern)

“We necd a new sense of political values. These
times require a different order of thinking. We
cannot expect to meet. our problems with a few in-
herlted ideas, uncriticised assumptions, it foggy vu-
cabulary, and a, machine philosophy, Our political
thinklng needs the infusion of contemporary his
sights. The enormous vitality that is regenerating
other interests can be brought into the service of
politics. Our primary care must be to keep the
habits of the mind flexible and adapted to the move-
ment of real life. The only wsy to control our
destiny is to work with it."

Such was Walter Lippmaun’s diagnosis of Lhc
political and social problems of America in 1912.
In the 20 years since its expression it has re.
mained untouched as a plan of political action. His
analysis of 1912 is equally accurate in 1935. Apparr
ently we have changed little in our basic underlying
social and political philosophy as a mechanical and
scientific revolullcn have swept our civilization.
The leg is lengthening as time passes with apathy
and antiquated thought are the vogue. Pundit
Lippmann has a text that should be sent to your
Congressman for Christmas but first. read it and
Cogitate thereon.

.Sinex Began Dramatic ‘Career

When 10, Plays Many Roles Since

 

“My part in 'The Silver Col'd'
is the most difficult role I've ever
played,” said MayrFloyd Sinex
when interviewed between scenes
at rcbcarsai yesterday. “The cher-
actor of the dominating mother is
a devilish one, but must extract
sympathy from the audience." The
play to which she referred is to be
presented in Alumni Recitation
hull Thursday and Friday eve-
nings.

when questioned about: her dl‘a'
malic experiences, Miss Sinex re-
vealed that she started her dra-
matiC Career in the role of a little
boy in “Why the« Chimes Rang."
She was then studying or “learn-
ing to speak pieces," as she calls
it, at lhe Metropolitan School of
Music in Indianapolis, Ind.

She later appeared in several
plays in the Bayview High school
in Milwaukee before she came to
Grinnell. Sincc coming here she
hss had parts in “Ten Nights in a
Bar Room," "Meet the Wife," “Lit-
tle Women" and “A Woman's Hun-
01‘."

For a year and a half, Miss Sin—
‘ex studied at the Msclecn college
of drama in Chicago. While she
was there this summer, She en-

tered a cinema cuncpst and placed
second when her screen test was
sent to Hollywood.

“I’m going to New York after
I'm graduated, and look for a job,”

Music Lovers
Enjoy Recital
Last Night

By Kim Phelps

Despite the unfavorable weath—
er, s number of music lovers were
present in Herrick chapel last
night to bear Sarah Inness Mac-
Donald, pianist, and David E. Peck,
violinist, in a very interesting and
skillfully rendered program of so»
notes.

The Beethoven sonata in A mi-
nor which opened the program, is
one of the lesser known, but as is
the case with many of the early
Beethoven compositions, it has
much in common with Hayden and
Mozart. It was played with the
delicacy and well-marked accentu-
ations so Characteristic of the come
poser, and was agreeably spirited
despite its predominant minor key.
The fine quality of the playel‘s’
technique was especially evident
in the fast moving finale of this
number and it continued to be a
constanc delight lbmughcu: the
program.

Since sny form of Grieg is an
excuse for good tunes which are
varied but always grounded in
the Nordic folk song and dance,

sonata in G with its pleasing cons-

trasts in cheerfulncss and melan-
cholia, was well wellrreceived by
the audience. In making full use
of the resources of the
ments, Grieg also made great de-
mands on the players, which were
equally well met by Miss MacDon-
ald and Mr. Peck, Thcir artistic in~
terpretation deserved the enthusi-
astic applause that. was given so
spontaneously at the clnse of the
brilliant flnslc.

The Ccscr Franck sonata in A
major with its modern chromatic
harmony a source of melodic
charm, was certainly the highlight
of the evening. Although it is the
only sonata Franck wrote, it is sue
prcme among the more recent
masterpieces in this class, and the
accomplished and talented plsying

instru-‘

 

of Mr. Peck and Miss MacDonald
was easily seen and greatly appre- .
elated in this concluding selection.
Once again they delighted their
audience with a truly masterly
performance.
