By EDWARD mzrn'ntlcx

Browning, local chain.letter magnate,
admitted that he contemplated hiring
four clerks to assist in opening his

sibility of a decline in popularity of
the choin.letter.

“As I see it, there may be something
in the idea. i have received a dollar
bill each morning for the last three
mornings. l refuse to believe that the
chain i joined last week is to come
to an untimely end.”

Browning Heads winners

Browning heads the list of individual
winners with his total of $3.00. Second
place goes to Marion Frye with a gross
return of $1.50. Bunched closely to.
gether at this time are Reisinger, Mc.
Wethy, Duncan, and Conard with
totals of 20 cents. A few scattered re—
tums of a single dime have served to
keep alive hope for a better showing
