Doesn't Care for Football
As Mrs Steiner plied her with

hot toast and refilled her blue andi

white Willmvdvare coffee cup, she
admitted regretfully that football
is not one of her favorite sports.
“I always freeze with cold at a

to enjoy it."

Told that the Scarlet and Black
would go to press within an hour

from a College,” she said in her
