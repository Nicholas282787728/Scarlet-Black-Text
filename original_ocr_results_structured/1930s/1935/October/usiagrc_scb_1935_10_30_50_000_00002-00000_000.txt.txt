CONGRATULATIONS

Congratulations are the order of the (lily
for those who made possible the appearance of
Cornelia Otis Skinner on the Grinnell lecture
course. ~
Everyone was delighted with the dramatic
characterizations of Miss Skinner, and the ap-
pearance of such noted performers like her and
Mr. Beebe, who was here last year, really make
the entire lecture program worthwhile.

In the past there have been times when
everyone more or less questioned the advisa-
bility of bringing to the campus many of the
inferior lecturers who have appeared here. The
coming of Miss Skinner is a fine start, and if
the year’s program is maintained at the pres-
ent level, the lecture course will really come to
mean something in the life of the Grinncll stu-
dents.

Congratulations, members of the lecture
course committee, You have‘ made an excellent
start for this year with the appearance of Miss
Skinner, and if you contine to bring to the
campus such outstanding figures, you indeed
merit tlle warmest praises and congratulations.

POOR CHEERLEADERS .

Probably the worst feature of a Home-
coming which left much to be desired in “the
way of enthusiasm and pep, was the mismane
agenlent of the cheering by the yell leaders,
who were either inexperienced or lacking in
ambition.

The cheers were poorly timed and chosen.
At one time frantic appeals to “hold that line"
were made after Creighton had managed to eke
out a few yards near mid-field. The boys on the
team were thus made to feel that somehow they

were failing on their job, when the exact oppo~
site was the case. That certainly does not help
thc morale of any team. '

At other times, in the midst oi: tense situ-
ations, when the cllccrinn should havc been at
its height. the cheel‘lcad entirely forgot their
duties and stood watching the game,

Two of the cheerleaders have llnd a year’s
experience and should by this time be able to
handle their jobs. If seems all too apparent
that they should be working hardest when the
home goal line is threatened, but such was not
the case. This certainly cannot be called {\ch
quaic choorloading.

The duties of the yell leaders call for con—
stant work, and it is only through this constant
effort that anything like the desired pep can
be obtained. '

If the load s do not want to adequately
c . then they are obviously illr
capable and elthcr should be replaced or drilled
sufficiently umil they thoroughly know their
duties and carry them out.

A DARK BLOT

‘On the same page in a recent newspaper
edition ap cared stories of the extent to which
\VI’A Wm evs enjoyed being off relief and of
a family of c kht starving while Iowa and Mis»
souri fought over whosc responsibility it was
to furnish relief.

It is indeed paradoxical that both these site
uation should arise at the same time. thu the
administration decided to take men off (li-
i'cct relief and put men in regular clllploylncllt,
thcy made a wise movc. Undoubtedly it is
better for men to be doing a day‘s work, even
if it is for the government. than to be drawing
relief money.

When one considers the latter condition.
however. a far different picture comes to light.
This particular incident took place ill Linevillc.
a town situated on the Missouril’owa boundary
line. The family in question moved from one
part of the town to the other, and thereby
lnoved out of Misoul'i and into Iowa. Now Iowa
is claiming that it is Missouri‘s duty to support
the family. Missouri, on the other hand, re-
fused to take the family.

A situation such as this is deplorable. \Vitll
the government debt increasing rapidly and
the administration claiming that no one will
starve, it is certainly an evidence of poor ad-
ministration when two statcs will fight over a
case, while the subjects of the fight. eight of
them children. are starving.

Is there not some way that such a‘situa-
tion as this could be taken care of without caus-
iilg misery and privation to innocent victims?
Are the dangers which such a situation will
surely lead to not likely to be more expensive
than the relatively small amount of actual
luoney involved?

A condition of this type callllot fail to pro
(luce children cri pled mentally and physically
through malnut on. The victims of this row
will be embittered against the existing order
of things for life. Things of this type are the
bcst possible breeding grounds for communism.

While' we applaud the administration for
the WPA program. we feel that the Lillevillc
problem is a dark blot on its record, which will
stand alou with blots caused by the fights
with Louisiana and Illinois earlier in the year,

over relief funds.

DORIC '

(a Column ol Pine beauty)

Doric this time offers no apolo-
gies and no tripe. It’s all the
straight goods, beginning with a
parody on the Malteaser’s latest
conceit. the Blackbail Court, in
which we shall not make the
slightest effort to be subtle.

Evidently the Des Mcincs Reg-
istcr representative who wrote,
“Grinnell Celebrates Homecoming
~With Dignity" didn't attend the
Honor G brawl. The only ones
there who displayed any dignity
were the chaperones, and they had
to. Our only wish was that some
of the old grads would either learn
to dance or quit trying. Kuncl, of
course, upheld his end of the deal
by clearing a space 20 feet wide

around himself.
