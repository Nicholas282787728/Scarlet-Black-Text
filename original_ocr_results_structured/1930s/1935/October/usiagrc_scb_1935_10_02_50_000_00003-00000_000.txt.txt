By Frances Hansen

Many a little girl dreams of
someday riding a white horse at
the head of a Circus parade, but
for Catherine Webster ‘36, that
dream really came true when she
traveled with Cimijoitti’s Hippoe
drama circus [or two weeks this
summer. Miss Webster, wearing
a gold crown and a white robe and
waving an American flag, led the
grand entry as the Goddess of Lib.
city.

She also rode one of the dancing
horses in the equestrian act. Her
Costume far this part consisted of
black riding boots, white breeches.
a red coat with gilt buttons, and
a high silk hat.

“We traveled through Iowa in
one-night stands." she Said in come
menting upon the methods of
travel, “moving on to the next
town in trucks at 4:30 a, m.” She
rode in the horse truck, which

Famous Horse Trainol.

The Cimijottis trained the high
school horse act for Ringling B‘m-
thers and have since been taking
their own act to fairs and exhibi-
tions in the Middle West. The
show consisted of Harper's Dog
and Pony Show, besides the train—
ed horses. “There were rmmkeys,
bucking mules, clowns and some
hats and a hand," she related.

Miss Webster said that the Wurst
part of the experience was that
they got only three hours sleep a
night, and that in the trailer which
served as ticket office. There was
a “big top". a cook tent, and a

sivini Big Event.

Driving two miles to a swim-
ming hole with the entire hand and
two acrobats in an old red Buick
was one of “the” events of the
summer, she said. The daily
swim was not entirely for sport,
since the bathing facilities with
the circus consisted only of buckets
of water carried by small boys who
wishcd to get in free.

“I'd like to try circus life again,"
she declared, “with a bigger circus
next time."

Prep Griddel-s
Asked to Report

Coach Truesdale Pleads
Larger Turnout

for

John C. Truesdale, freshman
football coach, today expressed
dissatisfaction with the turnout
for the frosh squad. “It is disap-
pointing," he said. "not from the
standpoint of numbers, but from
the standpoint of good men who
have not reported. Apparently
someone has advised these men to
wait until spling to report, thus
defeating the purpose of schedule
ing freshmen games.

He stated further that if these
men would confine their needed
recreation to football and spend
the rest of their time studying,
then there would be no logical rea-
son for them not to report.

Truesdale also announced the
definite scheduling of a game with
Mason City Junior college there
on Friday night. Oct. 18, He used
this as another point in his plca
for more men to report, saying
that Grinncll wanted to put its
full strength on the field against
Mason City. No other games
will he carded with either Coe col-
lege, Iowa State Teachers college,
or Drake university.

Coach Truesdale said that Dick
ullrich ’32, former Grinnell foot-
ball star, and outstanding bdck~
field performer with the Tulsa,
Okla, professional football team,
is assisting with the coaching of
freshment.

Additions made to the squad
during the past week have brought
the total number of men out to 41.
Those who have been added to
the team include John Burrus,
Fred Homann, Robert Nichols.
MacDonald Hobbs, Paul Bachly.
Edward Cole, Thomas Sawyer, Ede
ward Vaughn and Howard True.
