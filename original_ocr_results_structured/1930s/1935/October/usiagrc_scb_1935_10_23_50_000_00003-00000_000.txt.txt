the dopc bucket in’ holding the Blue
Jays to a tie.

13-6 count in an iiitcrscctional
clash with Duqucsuc at Pitts
burgh, Pa.

urday in the Pioneer homecoming

conference games scheduled.

Washburn will travel west to
meet Gonzaga at Spokane, Wash,
while Washington will cngagc in
another intersectional battle when

you’re a redrllead and don't like it
or a brunette who ci-avcs blondc
tresscs, don’t give up hope Pcl'ci .
idc isn't tho only recourse, for i
cent developments in thc xrray
field havc led scientists to believe
that x ay may be used to change
a person's complexion and the col»
or of his hair,

The matter was discussed hcrc
recently at the annual meeting of
the Western New York X'l'ay tech-
nicians. Dr. Alden J. King. pro»
fessor of radiological research at
Syracuse university, rccoiintcd de
velopment of a radioactive sub-
stance which hc said had pi-opcr-
ties similar to and more powerful
than radium, and which promiscd
some success in thc treatment of
cancer.

The potentialities of the erzty,
he said, in changing the form of
germ cells and producing typos.
might even extend to changing the
complexion and enabling the grow-
ing of tropical plants in the North.
