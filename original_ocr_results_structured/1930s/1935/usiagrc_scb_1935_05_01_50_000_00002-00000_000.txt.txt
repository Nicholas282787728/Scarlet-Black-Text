AN OBLIGATION

Next Saturday afternoon, Grinnell will be
host to the 28 annual Interscholastic track and
field meet. Not only will Grinnell as an institu-
tion be host, but each and every student, man or
woman, will be likewise.

How well Grinnell and Grinnellians live up
to their obligations is a question which in reality
depends upon the student body. While the
coaches and the administration can do much
towards providing a spirit of friendliness and hos.
pitality, still there will be a noticeable lack o.
warmth if the students do not cooperate.

One Of the best ways in which the true demo-
cratic and hospitable spirit of Grinnell can be
shown is by the attendance at the track meet it—
self. A large crowd makes a good impression, and
if Grinnell wishes to maintain its reputation as a
democlatic and hospitable school a large crowd
is necessary. Why not attend the meet?

RELIEF IN ILLINOIS
A battle between the legislature of the state
of Illinois and Harry Hopkins, FERA adminr
Strator, came to a head last weekend with the
virtual collapse of the Illinois Emergency Relief
commission, due to a lack of the needed funds.

Relief in Illinois has cost the federal, state
and local governments over $12,000,000 per month.
Hopkins has demanded that Illinois furnish
$3,000,000 of this total each month, or he will stop
the ﬂow of federal relief contributions. The
state legislature failed to comply with the de-
mands, and the May allotment has been with-
held.

The result is that the Illinois relief agencies,
which have been supporting nearly one million
people, have folded up. In Chicago a fund of
$1,200,000 has been raised through the sale of
bonds, and is expected to supply food and medical
attention until the middle of next week.

Meanwhile, the state legislature, which has
failed to act concerning the supplying of funds,
has snapped out of its lethargy and is now begin»
ning to pay some attention to this state of affairs.
The legislators are expected to raise the sales
tax from two to three per cent, and to include
public utilities within the scope of tax. However,
if this change in rate is to go into effect at once
the bill must carry an “emergency” clause, which
needs a two»thirds vote before it can be included
in the acts. If this clause does not pass the new
laws will not go into effect until July 1, and no
relief will be furnished the needy for two
months.

Undoubtedly there are a large number now
depending on relief who should and could be
regularly employed if they so desired. In so far
as a temporary cessation of aid caused these to
seek employment in the channels of industry, this
deadlock will have accomplished a real service.

On the other hand, by far the largest num-
ber of those on the relief rolls in the state are
bona tide cases and justly depend on the relief
funds for a living. What is to become of this
group. it they are not turnished with the necessi—
ties of life tor a period of two months? Are they
to be subjected to widespread misery, degradation
and suffering merely because a mere handful oi
legislators wish to satisfy their vanity, by a use—
less and hopeless fight with a much more power—
tul foe?

Many now “eye with apprehension and fear
the activities of the Communiss in this country.
If immediate action is not taken to secure relief
money, the threat of Communism in this one state
at least will really become something to worry
about.

Another result of utmost importance to the
citizens of the future will be the number of de-
formed and unhealthy children which malnutri—
tion and lack of shelter and clothing will produce.
Not only will they be a problem now as chil-
dren, but their care will be a. social problem ;Ior
years to come.

-It is thus obvious that action must he taken
and this unfortunate situation cleared up at once.
Will it be done? H. H.
