A GROWING DANGER

Recently advocates of the Patman Bonus bill
sent out a call to the country to flood Congress
and the president with telegrams demanding
passage of the bill even over the veto, which now
seems certain at the hands of the chief executive,
Estimates of the number of replies which will be
received in response to the lobby’s plea for sup
port, range around the total of one million.

The estimated response marks a new high
in lobbying attempts to bring pressure to hear
on Congress to pass bills designed for special
interests, and marks another milestone in the
growing inﬂuence of the loud voiced minorities.

If this call by the lobbiests is met with the
response which they hope for, a dangerous tend-
ency, which has long been developing, and which
is doing much to turn the national Congress into
a cross-roads debating society, interested in local
or sectional legislation, instead of the national
problems, will have become a fact. This country)
too often has been run in the favor of special in”-
terests, and if this latest lobbying effort succeeds
then no Congressman or Senator will dare look
crosswise at a member of one of the powerful
lobbies.

The right of all people to have a voice in the
affairs of their government is an admitted right,
but that does not mean that undue influence can or
should be exerted by special interests Obviously
the Veteran’s lobby is but one of the most power-
erful of the special interests exerting undue in-
fluence and like all the othérs should be curbed
and controlled,

Unless the American people take Steps to
curb the inﬂuence of these members of the “third
house of Congress,” they will soon find that their
supposed representation in government is mere
mockery, and that the legislators are bowing to
every whim and Caprice of the loud voiced minor-
ities who maintain special representatives in
Washington. Either lobbying must be controlled
or the future of American representative govern-
ment will be endangered.

THE STATES DANGER

Most of the responsibility for the present tie-
up in the Illinois relief situation has been placed
squarely upon the shoulders of Harry Hopkins,
federal relief administrator, for the uncompromis-
ing position which he has maintained. He has
refused to dole out federal funds until the Illinois

legislature finds a means of raislng the state’s
share of the relief burden. For his action he has
been accused of causing the starvation of unem—
ployed workers, and of being an ”arbitrary mon-
arch of all he surveys and pays." The charge
has been made that he has seriously abused his
power and subjugated the state of Illinois to the
whims of his personal caprice.'

The very nature of these accusations show
that they are based upon partisanship and pre-
judice against the New Deal They certainly
do not present a fairly-drawn picture of the situa~
tion as it actuually exists. The citizens of Illinois
should not be allowed themselves to be deluded
into thinking that they are the victims of an ar-
rogant and irresponsible dictator,

Rather they are the victims of their own lack
of political responsibility. They have now, for
over a week, allowed a group of small-time poli-
ticians hold up the passage of the measure design.
ed to raise the state’s quota of relief money. Ill-
inois relief stations are closed, and many unem-
ployed are faced with starvation, because the
sovereign state of Illinois has gone back on its
agreement to cooperate with the federal govern-
ment in providing relief money. The five hund-
red men and women who made a hunger march
on Springfield last Thursday would do better to
scare a little sense of responsibility into the heads
of self-centered politicians, rather than
to send telegrams to the president,
begging for help. It is a sad commentary upon
the state of politics in Illinois, when its governor
and its legislators cannot agree on a plan to
bring food to is starving citizens.

It is this sort of thing recurring year in and
year out that is bringing the state legisuatures
of our land into disrepute. Obstructionist tac-
tics and selfish political motives have become all
too characteristic of them, It is not so much the
federal government that is bringing about the
centralization of government, but the weakness
and incompetence of the state governments that
is making it necessary for the federal government
to step in and take over state obligations. Popu-
lar sentiment turns to the national government
rather than to the state governments for action
upon vital issues. Reform is much in need, and
upon its coming depends the future trend of gov-
ernment in this country, Rt Wt

“YOUTH SPEAKS"
(nrexel Triangle)

In reference to student anti.war strikes, Arthur Bris-
bane, columnist, said that if Young America is not “white
livered“ it will fight willingly when the time comes Over
and over again the phrase “You’re yellow" has been
hurled in the faces of our young men who are eligible
cannon fodder. is a boy “yellow" because he refuses
to seize a riﬂe and murder someone against whom he
has no nuarrcll. Those boys who refuse to fight are
not lacking in personal valor; they have merely dis.
covered why we have wars. They know that their
counu‘y’s honor is not at stake, and they also know that
wars are fought for profit. These same young men who
refuse to spill their blood for the benefit of Ll‘le munitions
men would willingly fight to protect their country. How.
ever, if war should become a reality it would not be
fought to protect our country's interests, but to protect the
interests of those whose business it is to promote wars. This
is why our enlightened young men ct today are rebelling
against war.

Mr. Brisbane is comparatively safe in his position be.
cause it is somewhat doubtful if a man who is close to
seventy will ever be drafted into service, It is lament.
able that a man who is capable of better inﬂuencing so
many people could not make use of his power to that
end. Instead of squelching the youths of America by
calling them cowardly, he could do a service for his
country by saying: “H the youth of America is not
white livered, it will refuse to fight when the time comes
iexcept in Real self—defense.”

A study conducted over a two year

CHAPEL
NOTES

Thursday

American music, its character and
future, was discussed in chapel Thurs.
day by Elias Blum, prof tor of music.
“Music as an art," he said ‘is primar.
ily universal in nature" rho rise of
national characteristics has been com.
paratively recent, but even in the
growth of choral and secular music,
the university is apparent.

As Americans we have inherited die
culture of Europe. Hymology and folk
songs followed here as a result of
of European trends. Even the negro
spiritual has a basis in the gospel mu.
sic sung at religious meetings. But
Americans have not left their music
umAmericanired, he said,

The United States has been domi.
hated by "junglisms” for several years,
but the fever is passing. Simple har.
monies such as “The Daring Young
Man on the Flying Trapeze" are com.
ing to the fore, Mr, Blum remarked.

Professor Blun-l concluded by re-
fen-ing to classical music. “America
has the heritage of all Europe; we
are the rightful heirs to achievement.
The way is prepared for the genius to
produce great American music that

is universal."

Jean M. Smith, president of the
Women's Self.ocvernment associa.
tion, and William Maxeiner, presi-
dent of the Council of House Presi-
dents, spoke at the student chapel
Friday.

"Grinncll women, organised under
the regulations of the Women’s Self.
Government association, have fulfilled
the requirements of the international
Association of Women Students and
,are members in good standing," said
Miss Smith.

Any college in the United States
that has an enrollment of so girls
is eligible for such membership, she
explained. National and regional con.
ventions are held in altemam years
to which representatives are sent by
the college women of America.

“College life today is one mad swirl
of ceaseless act ity," Maxeiner said in
contrasting the Grinnell of yesterday
with the Grinnell of today All of
our energy goes into the stream of
extra—curricular activity. Eating,
sleeping, and studying are grudgingly
sandwiched in. '

in years past the student came to
