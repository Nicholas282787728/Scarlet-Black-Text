A DANGER T0 LABOR

The recent threat of a general strike hurled
by William 1“. Green of the American Federation
of Labor seems to be a foolhardy move on the
part of the labor leader. Especially does this
seem to be the case when it is considered that
one of the reasons for the coercion is in order to
secure an extension of the NRA,

To demand the long time extension of, the
NRA in the face of existing facts can not seem
to be anything but foolhardy. There is every
reason to doubt the efficiacy of that piece of legis-
lation, and to estimate its future worth by the
past only reinforces the belief that the NRA is
not likely to succeed in the future. Recently the
Brookings Institute made public the findings of
its report on the NRA and the opinion of that
body, which is generally considered as being a
fairly impartial organization, was that the NRA
had actually hindered recoveryr

Not only does the labor organization of this
country seem to be doing a foolish thing in de-
claring a general strike for such a dubious sub-
ject, but the action may have a serious detrimental
effect upon the entire future of the movement in
this country.

In many ways the present situation of labor
in this country is comparable to that of the trade
unions in Great Britain in 1924. At that time a
general strike was called in sympathy for the
striking coal miners, The strike was disastrous
as far as trade and business was concerned, and
the purpose of the strike was not achieved, but
instead the labor unions suffered a severe set-
back. The people of the country were so disgust—
ed with the economic tieup resulting from the
general strike that they actively opposed the
labor party and passed reactionary measures
which practically undid much of the labor legis»
lation of the previous years. The result was that
the Labor party in England, which is paralleled
in this country by the American organized labor
movement, was permanently set back,

The analogy between the English and the
American labor situation is quite clear. If any-
thing, however, the English laboring man had a
more justifiable grievance than does the American,
for the Englishman struck totry and obtain higher
wages for a fellow worker, while the American
is threatening to strike to secure the maintenance
of a piece of legislation which is rapidly losing
favor with the people, and which is almost sure
to be unenforceable, and if unenforceable is sure
to he a dismal failure whether continued for two
months or two years

American labor has made rapid advances un-
der the New Deal, but this action is apt to be
the handwriting on the wall, for there are limits
to which such a special interest as this can be
extended. If American organized labor does not
heed the writing it is apt to find that it has suf-
fered a serious relapse, which in the long run is
much more disastrous than the mere extinction
of a piece of legislation which already has lost
the support of the country. American labor take
heed!

HITLER’S PROPOSAL

Adolph Hitler in his address to the German
Reichstag Tuesday made a remarkable step for—
ward toward clarifying the European political sit-
uationr His speech, moderate intone, laid down
a plan which may in time prove to be a workable
solution of Europe’s problems. He emphasized a
program for the reduction or elimination of of-
{ensive armaments. He pledged fulfillment
on the part of Germany of the Locarno pact which
binds Germany, Belgium, France, Italy and Great
Britain to fight any other of the five signatory na-
tions which attacks another, He indicated that Ger-
many would participate in nonsaggression pacts,
He signified that Germany intends no treaty de-
nunciation with the exception of armament limita—
tions, by direct action, that is, the use of force.

mmwsmwmm

Perhaps the matter of the most immediate im-
portance was the stronge implication that Ger-
many would respect not only the frontiers of
France, but the 50 kilometre demilitarized zone on
the German side of the frontier, and that Germany
will seek none of its lost territory, unless by
friendly agreement. This was designed undoubt-
edly to reduce the tension between Germany and
her neighbors, especially France.

In return for these assurances, Hitler de-
manded that Germany be accorded complete
equality of armaments, a place in the family of
nations, and participation in future programs for
pacification and disarmament.

The man, who has been for some time con-
sidered the greatest menace to world peace, has
now come out with a distinctly conciliatory and
peaceful gesture. Doubtless many will look up-
on Hitler’s statements with suspicion, and will
deny that he is willing to back them up with ac—
tions. It is hardly conceivable that they are
merely empty words and phrases. Germany is
today in no position for a warr Her best chance
to be restored to her former position of prosperity
and inﬂuence is through peace and international
trade. Peace will enable her to build up the
firm economic and financial structure which she
needs. War will only create further havoc with
her economic welfare and will further endanger
her already precarious position in the family of
nations, What Germany needs is a peace which
instead of subordinating her, will aid her in re-
covering prosperity and self-respect.

This is apparently Hitler’s idea, and he has
indicated that he is willing to work for peace,
The question now is whether the other nations
will recover from their severe case of the jitters
and will trust in and cooperate with Germany
long enough to make appreciable progress towards
achieving real peace—KW,

(Daily Northwestern)

The morning headlines telling of tho death of Jane
Addams stand as a transient monument to the memory
ofa woman who devoted her entire life to the cause of
less fortunate beings. She had little of her own. She
needed even less. Her happiness wits found in the
the knowledge that she had given unselfishly all of her
lite, and succeeded in beautifying the lives of hundreds
of others by her own example. She made the miracle
of Hull house possible. That. in itself, is enough. To
enumerate her other accomplishments which made her
become known as, “America’s most valuable woman,"
however, would be an endless task. It is sufficient to
say that she is gone and will be missed.

Today there are headlines and columns of print
commemorating her. Tomorrow these will all be for-
gotten. Her real monumenu are the memories that will
never die in the minds of those who knew her.

FATHER COUGHLIN'S TACTICS

rather Coughlin is undoubtedly sincere. But let
Coughlin followers answer this. Why is it that no eco-
nomist of any note agrees with rather CoughlinY whence
comes this priest's long range of experience as an eco.
nomist such that he alone can speak with such unbesite-
ting assurance that certain schemes and nothing else
will solve our complicated ills? rather Coughlin is a
surface—hitter. His economics are not deep, well—thought
out, but he appeals to the general mass of the public by
his honeyed sympathy for the down-trodden poor man,
the worker, and by condemning in scathing terms the
capitalist and rich man as vultures, as inhuman beasts
who are scheming to do the poor out of their little. '

He scourge: the international banker until in the
minds of a great many people the thief and the gangster
benefit lavorably by comparison with the banker. One
of his pet schemes is to put the central banking system
entirely in the hands of the government, as though we
have not had enough sad experience with government
management of private business. ‘

Sincere as he is. then, surely we cannot give serious
consideration to his schemes for bringing back prosperity,
and for managing governmental affairs, because. again,
there is too much of the spectacular, half—baked aspect
to his doctrines, t

Thus, while we are amused by his three-cornered
battle of words, let let us not forget that there is an especi-
ally serious aspect to the whole attain it simply exem-
plifies that, today, there are such a vast quantity of'radi-
cals in the public eye, that it is a great possibility that
the national mind might be inﬂuenced to a dangerous
extent, especially since so many of these radicals are
mob movers and are such able crators.

However, this alarm need not be too great, for the
American people as a whole have too much sense to
throw over the deep and fundamean wisdom of our
constitution for some of these nine sounding but‘treachernus
and half.baked schemes which will lead only to ruin in
the long rum—The Oranam, St. John's University.
