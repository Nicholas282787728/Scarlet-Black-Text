Perhaps it is because the preps are
modest that they hesitate to assume
the highest honor ot wearing a prep
cap. or perhaps the weather HAS
been a little cool. At any rate the
boys have been somewhat hesitant ot
entering the white glare oi publicity

Reporter Discovers Herpetologist
Living Incognito on Local Campus

Lear Grimmer, '38, Admits
"'Pt‘a’saion for Hunting
Reptiles

By PAT GALLAGHER

There are many collectors oi stamps
among the students at Grinnell col.
Collegkwe have no doubt there are
some autograph tiends, and are sure
that couections ot pressed flowers
would not he tound a rarity. It is
reasonably certain, however, that Lear
Grimmer is in a class by himseli as
a couector so tar as Grinnell is con.
named.

learning that the Quincy, lll., trcsh.
man was to make a like snake col.
lection as part oi his SRE work at
Grinnell, our curiosity was aroused.
This morning we talked the matter
over with Mr. Grimmer himselt and
tound that this odd work assignment
was not made through happen.chanoc,
as he has been an active herpctologist
(reptile collector to you and me) for
a number of years.

Collaborntes With Teacher

He gained enthusiasm tor this hobby
lrom his high school biology teacher.
who for many years had been an
avid collector ol snakes. Grimmer and
his tormer teacher. in collaboration
with two other high school classmates
oi tho iormer, spend most oi their
summer vocation periods following this
pursuit.

At present, Grimmer intormed us
the joint collection includes only some
so snakes, representing about 15 var.
ieties; but early this tall thcre were
over 500 specimens in the collection.
0i this number about 400 were sold
and 50 or so died.

Sells to Zoos

Surprised at the apparently large
market for assorted snakes we asked
where [he reptiles were sold. “Most
of them go to the Muiord Antivenin
institute at Glenolden, Penn, where
they are used to make a'ntiycnin which
combats the cttects oi snake bite,” he
said, “but we also sell snakes to the
Bronx zoo, the National zoo at Wash»

ington, D. c, and to the city zoos at
Toledo, Ohio, and St. Louis, Mo.”

Asked what prices the snakes
brought he replied that the price varies
widely, depending upon the size and
species oi the snake. “We get one
or two dollars [or average size
cottonmouth moccasins and up to iive
dollars tor diamond_back rattlers.”

“I have been oiiered as much as $15
dollars tor a single snake, though,” he
continued, “That was tor a diamond
back rattler six icet seven inches long.
I didn‘t want to part with it, however,
and reiused thc offer."

“How do you teed the snakes while
in capivity~and what?" we asked.

Earns Audience
Approval Friday

By ,ltlTA PHELPS

Again the Grinnell college Men’s Glee
club showed tine training and versaul.
ity in the annual home concert which
was presented last night in Herrick
chapel. The first selection, an old
English hunting song, “John Peel”—
admirably suited to men's voices and
always a lavorite with audiencesi
made one feel immediately that the
club was completely at home on the
concert platform. The men did some
oi their best work in the humorous
serenade, Haydn’s “Maiden Fair.”

Richard Kuncl's solos sung \vltl-l
charm and case were well received by
the audience. His encore “’Till I
Wake" by WoodforLFindoli, especial—
ly pleased the audience.

George Markers solo in “The Night.
ingale" by Tchaikovsky and. the Club's
subtle crescendoes and dinlinuendues
'n the Saint: number were character.
istic ot the Russian style oi singing.

Chester Williams, David Phillips,
Eugene Wongewaard and David Peck
were icatured in the male quartet
numbers, Of these, the selection
“Bones Come a-Knittin’ arranged by
Marshall Bartholomew was particular.
ly enjoyed, perhaps bccausc oi the
farcical facial expressions of Mr. Wil—
llams and David Phillips.

Professor Pcck's artistry as a violina
ist was manifest in his Solo, “Romance”
by Svendsenl His fine musicianship
and interpretation was appreciated by
all.

it was evident that the men enjoyed
singing the rythlnical negro songs,
