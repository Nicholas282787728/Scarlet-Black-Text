WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 27,1935,

(Continued from page 1)

Because students in the past
have mistaken the annual gridiron
banquet for a general razz nest

of the football team, the sponsors'

decided to call the dinner a razz
banquet instead of the more con-
ventional ten-u of gridiron banquet.

Banquet Annual Affair

The man banquet is an annual
affair sponsored by the Sigma
Delta Chi, professional journalistic
fraternity, but last year it was
omitted and so has not been held

since 19339, when the theme of the'

program was built around the slo-

gan of “too much student govern-v

merit."

The razz sheet will issued

be

during the dinner, which will in“

as campus gossip is concerned, ac—
cording to Kelsey.
