Heavy Lunches Impair l
Sbmd'ent’s Alertness

philadelphia, Pa. (ACP)—You’li
dispense with heavy lunches if you
want to be alert for your after»
noon classes. That is, you will if
you heed the advice of Dr. Donald
A. Laird, Colgate university psy—
chologist,

While on a recent visti here, Dr.
Laird had this ,to say about the ef-
fect of eating large meals at noon—
time:

”Our experiments showed con—
clusively that brain, or cerebral,
anemia, caused by the digestive or-
gans drawing the blood away from
the brain, is the cause of the
sluggish mental condition which
afflicts office workers after the
noon lunch period, and that this
condition results in a definite
impairment of the speed and ac-
curacy with which their minds
work.

Englishman Believes
College Men Poor Sellers

College men are too diffident and

the opinion of Charles c, Knights,
an English business executive who
addressed a meeting of sales nian-
agers here recently.

“For 99 per cent of salesmen in
their daily work, the‘ university
man has no advantage over the
secondary schoolboy," he believes.
“What use is a knowledge of Latin
or Greek, or higher mathematics,

A member of the varsity squad
told us last week that he thought
Michigan State would beat us
ivorsc this year than they did last,
but that Grinncll would have a
better season this year than last,
The first prediction came true last
Saturday, and we trust that the
second will hcfore the season is
over.

Although beaten by a much
larger score than in the game at

East Lansing a year ago, the

squad emerged from the tray

in much better condition. A re-
currunce oi n linec injury sus-
tained by Bi!l Fowler in the

Central game, \\')IS the only ml.
jor injury. 1n the gnmc last
year, Bob Morgan, ' nt rookie,

broke a finger, and Vic Fiiii,
liillliiicli, was loreoil out of a
number of games with a dislo-

cated collnrboiic.
