of Career as Newspaper Photographer

Addresses

of Local Journalism

Dinner Meeting

Fraternity

The trials and tribulations oi a
newspaper photographer were reveal.
ed by George Yates, staii photographer
of the Des Moines Register and Tri.
bune during an inionnal meeting oi
Sigma Delta Chi at Pioneer hall Mon.
day night, Drawing upon his iund oi
experiences gained irom 16 years con.
nectiorl with the Register, he brought
out much oi the glamour and diiiicol.
ties oi the newspaper game, as it ac.
tually happens and not as the movies
portray it.

Rambling on in a very iniormal
manner, inserting humorous comment
here and there, Yates proceeded to
reveal much ci behind the scenes in
a newspaper photographer’s work. De.
scribing some oi the diiiicultics en.
countered in obtaining the pictures
used in the ordinary paper during the
day he explained the troubles oiten
encountered in getting pictures of ex-
ecutions, noted personages, oi the pur.
suit and capture oi criminals, oi iires,
iloods, airplane nights, and oi a dozen
other scenes that oiten make the days
news.

clever Work
“An example oi clever work on the
part oi a photographer," Yates re.
marked, "occurred in Chicago three
years ago at the Democratic national
convention. McAdoo had just swung
the California delegation over to
Roosevelt, and all oi the news photo.
graphers were busy snapping pictures
oi McAdoo on the platiorm. The pic.
ture men then all made a rush ior the
doors only to find them locked and
barred by the police who would.per.
mit no one to enter or leave, in an
eiiort to bring to some order the mill.
ing crowd inside oi the Stadium.
There were 30 or 40 photographers
—all with iront.page news pictures,
But unable Io reach their presses.

”However, there was one reporter
who was not stopped. Having noticed
a stretcher in the first aid Station near.
by, he persuaded two oi'his colleagues
to carry him out. And tucking his
plates under hp coat he succeeded in
getting outside and scored a scoop ior
his paper."

Hard to Get Photos

I discussing the hardships of oh.
la' ing photos, Yates declared that the
most difficult people to obtain pictures
oi are the little people thatthink that
they are important. The big people
are usually the easiest to obtain pic.
tures of, Yates believes.

"Just recently." he remarked, “when
l was in Washington shooting pictures
oi prominent people, I spent three
days in the lobby oi Jim Farley's oi.
iice trying to get a picture and iailed
even to get past his secretary.

Theodore Thomas ’28, who resigned
its college director of employment this
winter aitcr serving in this capacity
irom the irrst oi the school year, has
rejoined the stall of Grinnell college
as a field representative for thc public
relations department. He began his
new work at the beginning of the pres.
ent week, and is now traveling through

door oi his private oiiicc. knocked,
walked in, and said, ‘How do you do,
Mr. Farley? l have been w ‘ ‘ g [or
three days to get your picture,' and
with that I snapped the camera. lie
merely grinned and had to take it."

Switching to more practical subjects,
he described the organization oi the
photography staii oi the Des Moincs
Register. Nine iull.time men are now
on the staii, and they are constantly
being sent all over the state to take
pictures in connection with the em
”Right now I could use two additional
photographers," he remarked in re.
lating the constantly increasing use of
pictures in the papers.

Staii Grows

The staii oi photographers has
grown since 1919, when Yates iirst
joined the paper. Since coming over
irom England, aiter serving in the
World War, he has witnessed the ex.
pansion oi the photo department it om
a one man aiiair to is present size.
During the past 16 years, he has seen
vast changes in the methods oi photo.
graphy and in the transmission oi pic.
tures, as the editors have clamored
ior more and more speed in getting the
news beiore the public.

“Wirephoto is the labest develop.
ment in the race against time,” he re.
marked. "it takes about eight min.
utes to send or receive a picture by
wire photo; yet the other I saw the
managing editor oi the Register stand.

his ioot with impatience as he waited
for a photo which he had ordered on.

Yates believes that the day is com.
ing when the entire iront page oi the
newspaper will be devoted to pictures,
as the public demands more and more
visual explanation oi the news stories
