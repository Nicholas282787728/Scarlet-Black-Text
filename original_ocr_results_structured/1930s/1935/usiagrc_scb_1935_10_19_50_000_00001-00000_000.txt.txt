not have enough initiative and
self-control when they get out or
school."

given almost unlimited self-gov-
ernment, they found the responsi-
billties too heavy and shifted them
to the faculty.

“Now,” he said, "we Grinllellie
ans are fortunate that our powers
are palatable. We rule to the full
extent of our own capabilities.”

Miss Smith declared that the
present students of Grinnell can
truthfully say that this is one of
the best years that Grinnell has
ever had. She illustrated her point

the Scarlet and Black the trite-
ness of the declaration, but con-
cluded that it was nevertheless
true. because of the great ad-
vances which the college has made
this year.
