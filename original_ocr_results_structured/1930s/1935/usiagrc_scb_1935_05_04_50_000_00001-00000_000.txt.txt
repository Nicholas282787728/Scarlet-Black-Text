head of each table and to serve as a
moderating influence,” Maxeincr, stat.

neglected, and there is too much un.
necessary noise."

The system of appointed table heads
was used last year. but was dropped
at the beginning of the present school
year. Another feature of the plan,
which will not be renewed until next
fall, calls for discussions of etiquette
with the freshmen by someone de.

water color paintings opened this af.

ant professor of art.

The display has ben chosen to rep.

Leading Watercolorist

O’Hara is recognized as one of

Until 1929 OHara had been the

success because he "dared to be him.

great master he developed his own
technique, for, he maintains, “There
is too much danger of becoming a poor
imitation of a great painter."

Home in Washington, D. c.

O‘Hara’s home is in Washington, D.
0., although he has actually become
known as a nomad painter. He was
the first American artist to take a
comprehensive painting trip through
Soviet Russia and the first to spend
almost a half year in South America.

When he is asked why he doesn't
paint in oils, he answers. “Because
lhaven't yet Come to the end of
watercolor." Many of his watercolors
have won international recognition,
his one.man exhibits have circulated
throughout America and Europe and
many galleries and individual collec.
