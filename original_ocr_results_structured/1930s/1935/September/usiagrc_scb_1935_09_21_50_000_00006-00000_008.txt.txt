of Oklahoma, he immediately afterwards became the
world‘s greatest wandering boy. on his return from
Australia, a booking agent signed him up for a horse
show in New York in 1903. If horses could get
along in New York, young will could. Swinging a
lasso was something new in the east. Will was en/

Hammerstein‘s Roof.

Later Flo Ziegfeld wanted his midnight frolickers
