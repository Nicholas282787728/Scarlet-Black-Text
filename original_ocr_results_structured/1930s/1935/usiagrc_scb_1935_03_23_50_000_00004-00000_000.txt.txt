Unique Program
Given by French
Group Thursday

_.

By CARL A. NUMEYER

The "Pot.Poul-ri Prmtanier," pre.
sented, appropriately enough, on
Thursday evening, the tirst day ot
spring, by ihe Grinnell college “Carole
Francois." was informal and unpr‘e.
tontious entertainment. The neatly
printed program may have at lirst sug.
gested a solemn attair, but the pro.
gram was not adhered to; and one had
always the agreeably expectant teel.
ing that almost anything might happen
on the stage. What did happen was
this; Joseph Conard (the program call.
ed him Josepha Caunar) displayed his
powers oi ventriloouism by giving the
doll Chow—Chow a French lesson; the
indispensable Tierra Koski iapndanced,
tumbled and iuggled; Goodwin Murray
lived up to the promise oi the program,
which described her as “daneuse ex.
il'aordinail’e."

“The Tragedy oi Arlequin," in tour
scenes, proved rather to belong to the
Gammer Gurton school oi comedy.
One had at the end oi the play the
impression that many people, provided
with enormous noses and bizarre K3054
turnes, had hit many other people over
the head, to the accompaniment of a
good deal oi rapid. it not always crys.
tal clear, French. But everyone on
the stage was having such a gay time
and the audience was entering so
obligingly into the spirit oi the show,
that critism was fairly disarmed.

Only Harry Duncan, a5 Cassandra,
recalled that the actors were supposed
to simulate marlonettos, and strove to
reproduce the rigid motions oi the
puppet. Robert lrwin, played Arie.
quin with proper abandonr Mention
should be made too of Boyd Burghard,
who in a beret and wooden shoes was

' no doubt the most convinuing French
peasant ever seen in Grinncll. All in
all, the members of the audience must
have [elt that their dimes had been
well spent.

“Have {1 cigarette”

T

(JDAY people all over the world use
tobacco in one form or another.

They chew it, they smoke it in pipes,

they smoke cigars and Cigarettes, and here
is what an eminent physician strid about
cigarettes:
“I have been something of a student
(7f cigarettes, and it 7‘: my belief that
they 017m- t/zc mildcst and purest form
in which tobacco is used."

Yes, nowadays the Cigarette is the most
popular form in which tobacco is used. A
good cigarette certainly gives men and
women it lot of pleasure.
