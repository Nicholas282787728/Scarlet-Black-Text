Grinnell Pastor

Delivers Vesper
Address Sunday

Rev. Robert L. Inglis, pastor of the
Grinnell Congregational church, spokc
Sunday afternoon at Vespers on “Re.
ligious Perplexities." The Rev Mr, In.
glis stated that much of the ullccl‘ia
ty of this generation could be traced to
the religious instability of the parent
generation.

“I have a theory,” the speaker ex.
plained, "that most religious difiicul.
ties, personal uncertainties, and the
anemia of organized religion is due
to the fact that religious education
has been largely the ‘dishing out’ of
ready made solutions," As a result,
he pointed out, all the religion a nod.
phyte has is some mass production
ideas conveniently accepted but no
personal discovery of a high philosc.
phy of life.

Though many accept the belief in
Jesus religiously. the speaker stated,
yet they often believe in selfishness
as a matter of course in living. The
religion worth while is that discovered
by one’s own self.

The speaker emphasized that the
real question about religious perplexi-
ties is not “How are we going to do
away with them?” but “How are we
going to use them?" Our perplexities
are a challenge, necessary for spirit.
ual growth. Recommending that those
who have no perplexities should cult.
ivate some, Mr. Inglis added that our
perplexities may be so used, however,
that they become sterile and produce
no good,

The speaker concluded by defining
perplexity as neither the final triumph
nor the iinal cataclysm, but the be.
ginning of wisdom. “if sincerely fol.
lowed, it is the start of a new way
out of darknes into light."

 

Big Bad Wolf, RedRiding Hood & Co.
Found Residing at Instructor’s Home

Among Puppet Characters
Made and Operated
by Grant Smiths

The Big Bad Wolf, Little Red Ride
ing Hood, and Cindemlla have been
on the campus since last fall, though
very few people were aware of thcir
presence, and they have not appear.
ed in public.

The trio have been in hiding in the
trunks of Mr, and Mrs. Grant Smith,
who last year staged marionette shows
as a hobby at Coleraine, Minn., where
Mr, Smith taught chemistry at Itasca
Junior college. Besides the three
above named characters, Mr, and Mrs.
Smith have the minor actors necessary
to stage “Cinderella" and “Little Red
Riding Hood," and Teto, an acrobatic
clown. ‘

Last year Mrs. Smith was asked to
provide entertainment (or the Cole.
raine \Vomen’s club. Though without
previous experience with puppets, she
decided to put on a marionette show.

Presented “Cinderella”

Enlisting the aid of Mr. Smith, Mrs,
Smith started preparations in Novem.
ber for presenting “Cinderella." The
two manufactured the dolls, built a
stage and setting, lcarncd to mani.
pulate their actors, trained three as.
sistants, and staged the show the fol.
lowing January. The immense
amount of work necessary to present
the pcrtormauce included from two to
three hours practice each night for a
month.

So popular did the show prove to
he that the Smiths were asked to pre—
sent: it again at the Coleraine theater
for the benefit of the children of the

city. They also appeared at three
other Minnesota towns, in theaters
and before clubs.

Built stage, Furniture

To provide setting for the periorm.
ances, Mr. Smith built a stage 10
feet long, three feet wide and six
fect high. He also built iurniturc and
helped Mrs. Smith decorate the inter.
ior.

The dolls used in the shows are
also of homo manufacture, according
to Mrs. Smith, Corks, paper mache,
plaster oI par-is, and other household
materials go into forming the heads.
These are attached to bodics stuifed
with cotton and richly dressed in bits
of satin, silk, and velvet of brilliant
and varied color.

Prepare For Second Show

Eight characters, 22 inches tall, in.
cluding Cinderella, the prince. and the
two ugly sisters were used in "Cinder.
ella," and at times seven ot them were
on the stage at once, Mr. Smith mani.
pulated the prince and spoke his lines,
and also played one of the ugly sisters,
speaking in falsetto for her part. Mrs.
Smith handled Cinderella.

Between the acts of the main pcr.
Pomlance, Mr. Smith entertained the
audience with Toto, the clown doll.
Teto, according to Mrs. Smith, walks
a tight.rope, performs a juggling act,
and indulges in slapstick comedy,

22.1nclt Puppets

Alter presenting Cinderella, Mr. and
Mrs. Smith began preparations for giv.
ing “Little Red Riding Hood." After
completing the dolls, however, includ.
ing the Big Bad wolf, who has enor.
mous jaws and a long, dangling ton.
gue, no further work has been done
on the production.

Though they have received numer.
ous requests that they give a marion.
ette performance in Grinnell, they

 

have been unable to do so as yet, Mrs.
Smith states. Since there is no one
here who is trained to assist them, it
would require at least a month to
train helpers for the work, besides
many other details which must be ar.
rangcd tor the production.
