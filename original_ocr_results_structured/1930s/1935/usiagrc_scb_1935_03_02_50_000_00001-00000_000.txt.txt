Athletic Board,
Decides to Drop

Hall Water Polo‘

Water polo was dropped from the
intramural sports schedule by action
of the men's intramural board Wed.
ncsday evening, intramural Director
Lester Dukc revealed yesterday. The
action was approved by a 4.2 vote
of the board members,

Three masons were offered by DL
rector Duke for the decision to drop
the tank sport. Epidemics of sickness.
probably due to the poor swimming
ability of a large share of thc par-ti
pants, and consequent numerous duck.
ings have followed the water polo
competition each of the last two years.

Practicc‘ impossible

Behind (his is the fact that the pool
ls not available for practice periods
and the men are consequently unable
to develop arcir physical condition or
become acquaintcd with the science of
the game.

In add ion, the winter athletic pro.
gram is so congested that the water
polo contests cannot be gotten out of
the way before spring vacation with.
out playing some of them at night.

Officiating Made Difficult
And finally, official water polo can.
not be played in the Grinnell pool be.
cause of is one shallow end, neccessi.
tating the alteration of rules—which
complicates the problem of officiating
the contests.

At the board meeung Wednesday
the possibility of adding volley ball
and handball to the hall intramural
program for next year was also dis.
cussed. According to present plans,
two new handball courts are to be
built in the heating plant this summer,
and will be available for use next
year. The volley ball competition
would be held outdoors, and probably
will take place early in the school
year.
