Here ‘is ‘an open letter to those

find thjé summer preparaﬁons for
college rather bewildering. Wc'va

so very glad, .Herc is an answer
to the questinns you'll want to ask
about what we wear.

Anything you want to wear will

Campus Tags

For campus wear through fail and
winter the best is a twin waster
set in your favorite bright color,
a wool shirt, and gunhoats. It you
insist, and most co—cds don't, you
might add a beret or a perky felt.

And about frocks for Sunday and
the many informal afternoon and
evening doings, the street and af-
temoon clothes you wear at home
are right. And gal, wcar color
whila you cankyou have many
years to wear black, Mama, yours
is the bright age, and it is color that
attracts the masculine eye.

Black Crepe Stylish

We do find the’ in Grinncll that

Few Formals Needed

With this of! my mind, thurc is
the subject you’re dying to hear
about—tomals. We have plenty of
formal dances in Grinne'Ll and a
few dinners, and Mazie, I hope you,
and you, and you, and 3‘ your
friends get to all of them LE you’re

or white with a little jacket is best.
it’ll serve as two. But if you’re go—
ing to have more than one I beg
to suggest one very sophisticated,
lor the ﬂame in you, and one very
sweet and simple for you: demure
self. If you want to be sure oi a
good time keep away from trains,
they’re not very young, and any.
thing else that might hamper your
dancing.

most girls wear their coats. But
it is a nice thing to ask your pct
aunt to give you for a farewell
gift
i‘m- Coat plot Nooossary

About coats, Mozio, fur is nice,
but don't pesler Dad fol: one. Ii
you can’t have hm got a heavy
hard weaning wool irimmed with
a little hardy £ur. A suede or wool
j'acket is the thing for sports and
classes.

Sh —undemazth _ well, wnolies
will keep you toasty in zero weath—
el', while scantios arc nicest at
other times. I advise undies easily
tuhahlc, that don't ncod pressing.
A ncgligac or lounging pajamas are
comfy for midnight feasts.

In candusim—ksep to the simplo
things that need the least care, and
remember hn-ght colors help pre~
Vent campus blues.

Aﬁecﬁonaiely,
