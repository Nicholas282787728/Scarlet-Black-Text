PLANNING FOR NEXT YEAR

Last week, Grinnell students had an op-
portunity to sign a petition asking that the
Christmas recess begin earlier than it had
been scheduled. Approximately 250 stu»
dents living in the college residences failed
to sign the petition, This failure of nearly
33 per cent of the student body to register
their approval can be interpicted in several
ways. At first, we might say that these
students are perfectly content to remain in
Grinncll over the week-end _ ‘ecedinz the
Christmas vacation. We believe that this
is not the case, however.

This minority group held the idea, we
believe, that to change, the college schedule
at so late a date would only disrupt the col—
lege study, social, and Christmas programs,
and would lead to general confusion. These
Grinnell students for the most part, togeth-
e - with the 380 persons who signed the pe-
tition, do protest that the college schedule
should have been arranged differently. Two
days at home hardly gives the average stil—
dent time to prepare for the Christmas holi-
day,

In 1937, Christmas will come on Satur-
day. May we suggest that logical and con—
venient dates for recess next year might be
from Friday, Dec. 1’7, to Monday, Jan. 3.
With such an arrangement Grinnell stu—
dents would have the time conveniently to
carry out their plans in preparing for
Christmas, and the student body will not
again face the inconvenience which cone
fronts them this year.

DANGEROUS OPPRESSION

"America is above the struggle between
Communism and Fascism. There is no need
for her to become involved," These were
the welcome words of Dr. Walter Kotsch—
nig, the inspiring lecturer at our Intel-n2, -
ional Relations Conference. But America
must be careful, Many signs of oppression
and repression in the country tend to drag
her into the conflict,

The recent attempt by Davenport offi-
cials and business men to stop loyal mem—
bers of the Spanish Republic from speaking
in the city is but one example. Business
men cancelled one after another the coli-
tracts for lecture halls hired by the spoil-

 

sors. The mayor tried to close the poor
place they finally got.

When the Black Legion boasts si million
members anxious to murder the many 0hr
jects of their hatred, such incidents as the
brutal murder of Joseph, Shoemaker by vigi-
lantes in Tampa are not surprising. Amerr
ca cannot hide her shameful record of nearly
4,700 lynchings.

AN EXPENSIVE ROMANCE

King Edward’s romance with Mrs. Simp-
son has received voluminous comment from

almost everyone who reads a newspaper

But one consideiation, at least, is often
overlooked; namely, the duty Edward owes

to England and to the rest of the world.

The often repeated statement that even
a king has a right “to lead his own life as
he chooses" leaves out a more important and
fundamental truth: that his actions closely
affect his whole empire and the rest of the
world. For it is a selfvevidcnt fact that
with England beset as she is with the inter-
nal question of Edward’s right to marry
Mrs. Simpson, she cannot play the dominant
role she should be playing in present deli-
cate international affairs; for the energies
of her best statesmen are being turned to

Edwards personal qual cl.

If the situation resolves itself to Ed-
no one knows exactly
what the results would be; but with the
lacking popular
support and adequate training for the king-
ship, it is possible England would be floun—
dering under an inefficient reign, Or in
