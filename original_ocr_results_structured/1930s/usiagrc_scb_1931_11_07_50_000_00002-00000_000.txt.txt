COEDS CREATURES OF THE EVIL
(From the Daily Norton stern)

Coeducation has often been subjected to oils
attacks but the latest one by a certain Idaho man,
Charles Hooper, who writes in School and Society, sur-
passes most of the others for bitterness and bigotry.
He does not confine his attack but includes women
smelting roorns, drinking and the alluremer‘lts of sex
as evils peculiar to coeducation. .

He maintains that young people can not study
when all the allurements of sex are about them. For
that reason he proposes that the system of eoedueatiori
be abolished and consigned to the “Sulphurous pit from
which it came,” for when the sexes are separated ”out.
of sight, out of mind.vv He forgets the vices that are
prevalent in segregated schools.

Taking his preliminary stand upon this single point
and for that reason wishing to segregate the men and
women in high schools and colleges, Mr. Hooper does
not appear to be very broad minded, He is so blinded
by the sex complex that there is little liklibood of con»
vineing him that coeducatiou has its good points. A
person who writes a diatribe like his has already closed
his mind and will not consider any evidence to the
contrary.

A person of this tpye would not realize that CO-
education has the endorsement of most of the leading
colleges and universities in this country, that sex is not
always the uppermost thought in the minds of our
eollegiaris, that far stronger men and women who have
a better understanding of human nature than he are
graduated from the very schools he ignorantly con-
demos,

A CHEERFU‘L LITTLE EARFUL
(From the Student Life)

American students are accustomed to hearing long-
winded lectures explain what is wrong with American
colleges. One of the chief grounds for condemnation is
the fact that too many people are in our universities
who do not belong there—~people who have come to
school only to have a good time, who fall behind in their
work and thus hold back the students more interested in
the scholastic angle. More than one dean is inclined to
agree with the Dean of the Harvard Business School,
who characterized college as a sideshow for dances,
football games, and drinking par-tie A complaint often
voiced by the students themselves that our colleges
have become too standardized, that degrees are handed
out on grades figured out to a decimal point on the
basis of papers. quizes, and exams, that they are tied
down by required courses and cut rules

An article by Emil Ludwig, in the American maga-
zine, entitled ”Why My Son Shall Attend an American
University,” is therefore of general interest. The fact
that a cultured German scholar, a. well known figure
in contemporary literature, should choose to send his
son to school here in preference to an English or Ger
man university, is rather snrpri rig. if the long list
of denunciations against us is well founded.

The fact is that those who criticize American insti-
tutions are looking ’at one side of the matter only,
whereas a foreigner can discover many points in favor
of our schools that Americans have overlooked.

Mr. Ludwig points out that. in the first place, the
acquisition of knowledge in America is a cheerful thing.
In most foreign univel,.ities, the association between
learning and dark, gloomy balls is a deep rooted tradi-
tion; here, we have a good time in school, and mix in
a wholesome amount of side entertainment. Another
factor of advantage is the close relation between stu.
dents and professors existing in our schools, something
totally locking in foreign universities

Furthermore, American youths, in the land of the
melting pot, grew up in an atmosphere of racial and
class equality—people of all nationalities and all posi-
tions in life meet in our colleges on terms of equality.
Our attitude is more tolerant than one could find in any
European country.

The charges of materialism so often levied against
us are, he says, exaggerated. or course we are material-
laticiso are the European countries; we‘re more honest
about it, thatvs all. Americans as a race are often
characterized by foreigners as too full of hurry and
worry to enjoy life, This too is untrue, No matter how
prc ing the demands of duty. we can always find time
for sports and recreations. AS a nation, we are happier
than Europeans.

Lastly, the ideals that the American student learns
in colleges here are far better than theirs. In Europe,
racial hatred and warlike manifestations are apt to
be met with in the university; here the national heroes
are not warriors like Napoleon and Cromwell, but men
of sympathy, understanding. and love, of the type best
exemplified by Abraham Lincoln,

Perhaps Mr. Ludwig goes just as far to the other
extreme as our native c cs go in their condenmzttions.
At any rate, though. he has pointed out some facts
worth considering. Perhaps we are fortunate in being
able to attend college in America after all.

Clearing House
Here Discussed
by Men’s Group

Need for a central clcarin house
for college activities, possib tics of
the library being open on Sundays
and the changing of the chapel hour
were discussed at the meeting of the
Lantern, Wednesday night,

of the library committee, as to
whether the library might be kept

flicting dates of college activities the
central olearing house idea was sug-
gested Wallace Henderson was dele-
gated to bring the matter up before
the student council, ‘

The small attendance at chapel was
