GRINNELL FACES 1930i

Grinnell has never had as bright a future
as it faces at the beginning of 1930. With the addition
of a million and a. half dollars to her endowment prac-
tically assured, a ﬁrm foundation is laid for the ex-
pansion of Crinnell in the future that should mean
for this college an enviable position among the institu-
tions of learning in the country.

A wider appeal than ever will be made by Grin—
nell to the highest type of high school graduates, wid-
er as to the number it should attract here and wider
as to the territory from which they should come.
When the high school student begins to think of ht~
tending college, his thoughts naturally turn to such
considerations as these: What are the educational
standards of the school. what is its ranking among
colleges of the state and nation. what the quality of
its professors, what the opportunity for social develop-
ment, what its provisions for care of the daily needs
of the student, and what its chances for a healthy
growth in the future? All these claim the attention
of the high school graduate and inﬂuence his decision.
In all these things Grinnell has always ranked high.
In the future this should be more true than ever.

The ranking of a college is dependent largely on
the smudurds of education it holds up. which in turn
depend on the quality of its teaching force and its
ability to introduce new subjects for study and to
conduct new educational experiments as the need for
them arises. Up to the present time, Crinnell has been
fortunate in being able to head its various departments
with men of outstanding ab ty and wide range of
knowledge. .But increasingly in the past decade, the

:

liberal arts college of limited means has been hamper-
ed in its efforts to bring to the campus men recogniz-
ed in their fields, with the state schools possessing
ample funds to draw such men to them. Grinnell has
been no exception in this regard; moreover, new sub
jects, such as geology, sociology and public relations
have not been introduced here largely on this account.
With an addition to the permanent endowment (>le
million and a half dollars, these handicaps should be
overcome and Grinncll enabled to stand before the
high school graduate on an equal basis educationally
with state schools.

As President Main points out elsewhere in this
paper, the fact that debt has been cleared up and a
large addition made to the endowment paves the way
for a building program in the future that will include
every phase of expansion—completely modern facilities
for the study of science and the ﬁne arts, facilities for
physical improvement, facilities to handle a larger
number of students. This is an cxtremely significant
fact, for Grinnell's physical equipment must expand
with her corps of instructors and widened range or
subjects. The increased endowment itself cannot Ida

wealth will feel much more dispcscd to give their sup.
port to for building projects.

Instructors that it might otherwise have been imr
possible to have in view of the rich. competing state
institutions, it wider variety of subjects, the paving of
the way for better physical equipmentrthese are
factors which ought to attract to Crinnell the
cream of the high school graduates of the wide ter-
ritory which this college now serves. They all mean
that the Grinuell of the future should be that balanced

They are made possible directly or indirectly by Grin»
nell's much lsrger endowment, and are the reasons
why the Pioneer school of the middlewest may face
1930 and the years to come with confidence.

EDA.

THE NEW LIBRARY SYSTEM.

While vacationing students have passed the hell—
days resolving to be bigger and better Grinnellians in
years to come, the college has apparently been mak-
ing a few resolutions of its own. one of these has to
do with the library. Under s new system, instituted
with the re-opening of school. the stacks have been
closed to all but staff assistants, and the books are
to be secured by application to one of these.

Those in charge of the library undoubtedly had
good reasons for instituting the new system. One of
the advantages of the innovation is that it ends the
possibility of a stack—room discussion group or ren.
dezvous which used to be a regular feature in past
library entertainments. Another advantage is that
it prevents absentrmlnded students from walking off
with a. shelf full of books without reporting their
acquisitions at the desk.

There is however one valid objection which all
students may make against the new system. That
is the slowing up of the book»getting process. It is
physically impossible for one or two staff assistants,
no matter how efficient, to attend to the demands of
fifteen or twenty students in the time that these fif-
teen or twenty students might attend to the affair
themselves. , _ _

Why Couldn't the new system be slightly modified
so as to retain all the efficiency of the old system and
still safeguard the library from the depredations com-
mitted under that system? If the desk and chairs
were to be removed from the stacks the possibilities of
public assemblage in these rooms would be automatic-
ally eliminated. And if all the students were forbid»
den to enter the stack-rooms with any books in their
possession, and had to account for every book they
might have when they passed out, the danger of une
official abstractions would be removed. A staff as
sistant could be posted at the stacksroom exit either
to check up on the books or see that the students

Story, Song to Be
Subjects.

Five classes of writing are to be
the basis of competition for the
' Henry York Steiner Memorial prizes
this year. Contestants may begin
work on their manuscripts which are
to be submitted some time before
spring vacation.

The classes of creative writing are:
verse, essay, drama, narrative .short
story, and song on which two per—
sons my collaborate for the words
and music. .

Prizes in this contest are created
from a. fund established In 1912 by
Dr. and Mrs. Edward A. Steiner in
memory of their son, Henry York
Steiner.

The following rules will govern the
awards as in past years:

1. Only Grinnell college students
are eligible to compete for the prize.
The number of manuscripts which
may be entered by one person is not
limited.

2. Manuscripts must be typed,
double-spaced, on one side of the pa-
per only. At the top of the first page
of each manuscript, the author must
designate the prize for which the
manuscript is entered.

3. Equal consideration

will be

given to unpublished manuscripts and
those which have been published since
March 1. 1929.

i. The use of pen names is neither
required nor prohibited. The name
or pen name of the author must ap-
pear on the first page of the manu-
script, beneath the title. In csse a
pen name is used, the manuscript
must be accompanied by an envelope
on the outside of which is enclosed
a slip of paper or a card containing
both the pen name and the actual
name of the author.

5. In any competition in which the
committee considers that no menu-
script of sufficient quality has been
submitted, the prize will be withheld.

Last year, the contest closed on
March 20. Approximately the same
date will probably close the contest
this year.

The winners of last year's contest
for poem, short story, essay, and for—
msi study were won by Helen King—
ery for the poem “Late November
Winds", Rebecca Conard for the short
story ”The Birthday Broom", Miriam
McNally for the essay on “In the In-
terest of Amateur Illness", and to Are
thur dePersia for the formal study on

manufacturers, wholesalers and deal-
ers is more harmful than beneﬁcial
to society."

Eight men will alternate in form»
