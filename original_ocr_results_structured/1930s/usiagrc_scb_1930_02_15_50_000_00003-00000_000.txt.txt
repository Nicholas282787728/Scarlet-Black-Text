F rosh Cagers
to Play Tutors

First of Three Game Sched-
ule; Will Play Carleton
and Drake.

The freshmen basketball men will
play the first of a three game
schedule when they meet State
Teachers at Cedar Falls Monday
night. The other two games which
have been arranged are Carleton at
North—field on Feb. 22, and Drake
here the 28th.

The freshmen quintet has been
badly crippled by the loss of two of
their star. players; Warner having
left school and Duncan being ineligi-
ble Duncan particularly, will be a
hard mar ' » eplace as he has been
the a .Ll round which all the

. built. The squad

. g' daily workouts with

.‘slty and should give a good

.,..i:0unt of itself in facing the Tutor
frosh next Monday.

Coach Watt has been using stra-
ley at center with James and Wol-
ﬁnger as forwards. Ullrich and Rob»
inson are likely to hold the guard
positions. other men who will prob-
ably see action against the cedar
Falls five are Southwick, Davis and
Fabian. A game between the “prep"
iive and the varsity reserves has
been scheduled as a preliminary to
the Grinnell-Washington encounter
tonight. This game will begin
promptly at 6:30.

.Dorrn Cagers Play
F inal Round Today

In the final round of the inter-
dorm basketball schedule, held this
afternoon in the gymnasium, the
newly-crowned champions, Langan
hall. faced Kelly stables. Smith op-
posed Four and Dibble clashed with
Clark.

While none of these games had a
bearing on the cup, all had a certain
interest of their own. Langan was
endeavorlng to finish its schedule un-
defeated, while Kelly Stables was
fighting to finish in second place in
the standings. Smith’s final ef-
fort to break into the win column
was matched by Four's desire to
finish the season with an even break
in the percentage column. Clark and
Dibble, traditional opponents, were
also fighting it out for second place
in the final standings, with the usual
“gory” battles being promised." ,

Water-polo will be the next intra~
mural sport, the games getting un-
der way next Saturday, when Smith

-and Clark, Three and Dibble, Lan-
gen and Four will begin a round rob-
in schedule.

Smith Hall Loses
to Building Four

Slow playing on the part of follr
teams characterized the two intra-
muraI basketball games which were
played this morning as part of the
windup of the season’s tournament.
Smith's basketeers met Foul”:
with defeats in both A and B con-
tests.

In the A game, Four early took
the lead and maintained it through-
out, finishing with a Ia-to-s score.

- Smith had chances for bringing up
her score but consistently missed
shot after shot.

Heavy penalties on the Four B
team which won 19-14 might have
meant her downfall when for the
last three minutes of play the team
played with three men, two having
gone out of the game on rouls with
no substitutes on the bench. Smith's
weakness showed up during this time
when Four was able to make two
baskets. Bradford showed up well
for the winners in this contest.

Two losscs leave SmiLh in undis-
puted possosion of the cellar posi-
‘Lion with no wins to her credit. It
also brings Four’s standing up to an
even number of games lost and won.

May Busby‘s portrayl of Pierrette.

delightful. James Clarke was pleas-

Pierrot his heart's desire. Pasty Far-

French Play Will
be Given Tuesday

A one act French comedy , "Les
Deux Sourds”, (The Two Deaf Mén)
by Moinaux, will be given Tuesday
night in the Alumni Reciation hall
auditorium at 7:15 o'clock. It has
been directed and will be produced by
Katherine Gillespie.

The cast includes Walter Secor as
Dnmoiseau, the deaf father; Helen
Lovejay as Eglantine, his only daugh-
ter; Ben Hensley as Boniface, the
servant, and Theodore Gieysteen as
Placide, Eglantine’s lover.

In order to meet the approval of
Egiantine's father, Placide pretends
to be deaf also. However the father
is cured of his deafness and refuses
to permit his daughter to marry a
deaf man. The solution lies in the
discovery that Placide has been
merely pretending.

’Before the play will he heard the
three traditional knocks, which pre-
cede the rise of the curtain in the
French theatre.

Men’s Forensic ls scheduled to hold
its third formal meeting of the year
next Wednesday night at 8 o’clock in
Music hall.
