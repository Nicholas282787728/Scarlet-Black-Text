’ BOO!

Well, the Pionccrs won a basketball gillnc last
night and there are a lot of studentsﬁspectfltors
last night—who are saying today, “WE beat
Drake” and actually thinking they helped will.

If we may he so bold—ave would like to say
plainly that the Grillncll quintet beat’thc Bulldogs
’ in spite of the spectators. '

We wouldn’t have the nerve to say that the
officiating done last night was anything exception-
al. Ill fact, some of it was of less than average
caliber.

Our point is, that the continual booing which
started when some of the Grinncll falls sztw ft foul
that the officials did not see, and degenerated into
a constant l'azzing of every move mode by them,
did not; do any good as far as cnzlbling the referees
to see better.

Had we been an official ill last night gulncsi
we would have called it foul on the cron‘drnt
least one.

Grinnell has been known for it long time for
its good sportsmanship, But any unbiased onlookr
cr lflst night would wonder how it ever got the
reputation.

‘UNJUST CRITICISM

A moving picture theatre, souudrpl‘oofed for
operation of “talkie” apparatus, does not make a
particularly good place in which to hold a pep
meeting.

A handful of students, in scattered groups—
many of them with datcsisepcratcd by groups of
outsiders, do not make a very good cheering sce-
tion.

Attendance at it pep rally for which any sort
of admission price has been charged, does not
represent a fair percentage of a student body.

A leader who does not have his program well
in mind is not conducive toward it spirit of en-
thusiasm at such a rally.

In view of these facts, we believe that stu
dents who were criticized for lack of spirit at
Thursday evening’s pep rally are not to blame,
and that the criticism is an unjust one.

TOO MUCH TALK "

In most college circles too much is said among
rthe students and faculty about “Handshakiug.”

Cries of ”Handsllaker”, greet every student
who lingers a moment after class to get a little
additional information or even to check up on on
assignment, and it tends to work against the fundar
mental dim of the institution.

The instructors are here for the solc purpose
of directing the student's study and they can do it
to a much greater advantage if: the student tells
them his problems. Besides this, many students find
their instructors genuinely interesting and would

on yo to know them beltov it they were not de-
tel'l‘cd by the, four of biting branded .l “Glade
lltllldcr.”

Other Opinions

REHABILITATING YOUTH
(The Daily Trojan)

“Mister, I gotta have a dime for coffee and cakes.
str, 1 am forced to ask you for the price of a bed. Say
brother, will you gimme the price of a square meal,
will ya? Hey, big boy, how about slipp‘m’ me two bits,
I'm sure starving?"

How those crics thunder- against one as he attempts
to walk about the town. Los Angeles is supposed to
be a tough center for handouts. but they all try. -

The tragic part is that so often the fellow who sitlles
up to you is a mere youngster in years. In the old days,
it was the tramp. either the harmless "Weary Willie”
or the hardened criminal, usually a ”gay cat,” with the
wings of the wanderlust in their feet and couls. They
were then tolerated for the most part unless Chain
gangs needed workers or the housekeepers were pr0~
testing that too many chickens had disappeared. Then
the marshals or other hardrcnsed minions of the law
would “cram” their shotguns and clear out the “jungles."
Many of you must have undoubtedly, seen gangs of
men marching wesrily along a railroad track to the
next town with a couple of mounted and armed officers
at a watchful distance.

“But them days are gone forever," as a popular
tune of that time would hum. The old vagrant has been
replaced by the young vagrant. The estimate of their
number ranges all the way from 200.000 to 500,000.

Even in 1929, folks were beginning to say, ”what
are we going to do about those youngsters?" The ques-
tion is now being aggravated by the fact that many
young men and boys are now leaving home, because
home conditions are so discouraging, and also because
there is nothing else to do, often they leave 'so that
their younger brothers and sisters will fare better with
more food.

These youngsters are dangerous to our public wel»
fare. Thirty-nine per cent of all arrests were of per-
sons untlci- the age of 24. One out of the three arrested
for burglary had not yet reached the age of 20. Nearly
one out of five persons arrested was in the age class
between 19 and 22. .

Therefore we must help those youngsters in their
uunequal struggle for existence" so that the ”potential
dynamite to the social order of the nation" will be doused
in a pail of common sense.

In California. a few camps are being maintained for
reforestation, etc, This is an excellent method, but this
idea should have been nation-wide in scope. Labor will
not be so cheap in the future, and the' nation should
take advantage of that labor to retrench and build up
our depleted natural resource

Sl‘LENT TRIBUTE?
(The Comelllim)

Ordinarily, Counell audiences, even in morning
chapel, have a gnctl reputation, Benno Rabinof must
have found us appreciative last week and we have been
complimented often for good manners at good speeches
and good programs. And yesterday one could not call
what happened after the morning program ill»mal:ll1ered,
only misguided,

Historians relate how, years ago, the original Ten»
dition of the Gettysburg address by its martyred author
received one of the most eloquent and appreciative
tributes possible for a, sincere, sensitive audience at a
great and solemn thingia long moment of blessed, un-
derstanding silence. Somehow, we always think of that
when something impresses us and the precious spell is
shattered by thoughtless, well-intentioned, perhaps per.
functory applause. It is almost barbaric in its harshness.

So often, when the event has been one worthy of
s more thoughtful response, some insensitive members
of the audience start to clap just because it is the thing
to do, the pseudo-sophistates shrug self-centered should-
ers as they don their coats, and some few more thinking
and sensitive individuals suffer in silence the painful
death of a beautiful moment. The result of this is the
incongruity of approval evinced by an attempted com-
bination of hearty clapping and respectful silence.

We liked the Lincoln reading in chapel yesterday
morning very much, and we should have liked to carry

.its atmosphere out of the chapel at least, But no, some

clapped, some didn't, and gene was the atmosphere. The
same thing happened this morning.

Some things one feels instinctively should be ap-
plaulied, Encores in music are obtained that. Way though
a. moment of silence, after a lovely composi on has
been played. often crowns sptly the work of the artist.
One applauds an ordinary speech in proportion to its
merit, but, strangely enough, clapping after the best of
sermons just isn’t done—at least on Sunday (we cannot
say so much of chapel days for student discrimination).
There is a time to applaud, and many times to refrain
from applauding, and learning when those latter times
are is by much the harder task.

Someday, before we leave the morning chapel serv-
ice at Cornell for the last time. we hope to see the
student body sufficiently impressed by some special
event to rise silently and file out of the chapel without
shattering B. desirable illusion, and without having been
requested previously to refrain from applause. ‘

Wiltler Enumerales Factors
Which Produce Criminals

“What Makes Criminals?" Milton
Wittlcr. assistant professor of cduca.
tlon, attempted to answer this ques-
tion in a. talk before the Workei
Cooperative college at the Unclc
Sam's club Wednesday evening at 3
o’clock.

Professor Wituei- gave the follow-
ing three factors that, he believes, go
toward the making of criminals: (1)
The home, the school and the social
environment tends toward making
Criminals: (2) Heredity is .a factor in
making criminals when the individual
is born feeble minded or otherwise
mentally diseased, and (3) Schools
stress book learning and because chil-
dren do not respond readily to such
unnatural training there is usually
a conflict between child and school.

Mr. wittler stated that there were
three remedies for these situations.
First, the parents should be educated
in a scientific method of treating
children. Second, the school systems
should be changed so that there is
more manual training in arts and
crafts under scientifically trained
teachers. Third, the environment
should be changed so that there is
very little in it conducive to crime.
