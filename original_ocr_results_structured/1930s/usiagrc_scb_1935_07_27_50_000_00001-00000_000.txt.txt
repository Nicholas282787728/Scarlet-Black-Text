With 215 new room deposits a1<
ready received and the prospect ct

The present total nunibegpot
room deposits represents an in—
crease ot 70 over the total number
received at this time a year ago,
according to Antoinette Swan, head
ot the deparunent of public rela—
tions.

Three additional residences outin
town will be opened to accommo-
date the additional students. Pio-
noer hall will again be opened as
a residence for men while the An-
nex, Dean Beatty’s fonner residence
across from the quadrangle, will be
opened as a cottage for women. The
Fellows home, purchased by the
college last spring and located at.
the north end oi Broad street facing
Merrill Park, will be converted into
a third town residence. It will
house approximately 20 men, while
Pioneer hall will again accommo—
date 11 men and the Annex‘ nine
girls.

Special Arrangements Made

Special aiTaligements are being
made to enable the town residents
to eat at the dormitories and the
quadrangle. The men will eat eith-
er in the men’s di ing hall in the
dormitories or at Pioneer hall as
has the custom last year, The
women living in the Annex will
eat in the quadrangle dining room.

Only upperclassmen will be given
the opportunity of living in the

but one has been secured, Mrs. W.
s Hendrixson, housemother in
Pioneer hall last year. She will
continue in that capacity again next

car, according to the office ot the
dcan of men.

Due to the number-\ottclganaes
resulting from the inoieds‘ed en—
rollment, definite room assignments
