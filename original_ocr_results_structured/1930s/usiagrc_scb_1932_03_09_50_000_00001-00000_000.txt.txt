Drips Finds
Long Hours
Make Editors

Maiirix Table Speaker Tells

Journalism Students
to Work Hard

“Editors get that way by eating
ink and sleeping on the paper stock,"
according to w. E. Drips, associate
editor of Wallace's Farmer, who
spoke Tuesday evening at the Theta
Sigma Phi Matrix table in the quad»
rangle.

”No one who is not willing to stick
to the game and work hard can hope
to reach an editor's position," he
said. “The annual turnover in the
newspaper world is so great that only
those who have ambitions and are
tough spirited enough not to be beat.
en down can reach the top. on the
Des Moines Register alone the year-
1y turnover is more than two hun»
dred.”

There are two kinds of editors,
newspaper editors and magazine edi—
tors, Mr. Drips said. The newspaper
editor usually works up to his posi-
tion by first being a good reporter,
while a magazine editor is a special-
ist in a particular line. The news-
paper editor must know how
write, must know something' about
everything, and must have had ex.
perience “pounding the pavement.‘
The old time “personal journalists"
who were the type setters,
readers, reporters, advertising man-
agers, and editorial writers, all in

one, are fast being replaced by those

who know one line well. The college
student who expects to go into joure
nalism should he well founded in his
tory. English, economics and science.

The field of trade journalism holclsl

the best prospects for college stu-
dents who are searching for posi ons,
Since every trade journal employs
several specialized editors. the speak-
er said.
