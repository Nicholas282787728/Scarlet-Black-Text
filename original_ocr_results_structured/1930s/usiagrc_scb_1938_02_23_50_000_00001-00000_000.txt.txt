Kotschnig Lists 1
Characteristics
of Germans

“Introvel'Slon, femini ity and a
feeling of inferiority are the es
senticl characteristics of the Ger-
man," Dr. Walter M. Kotschnig
said Tuesday night in speaking
on “The Two Souls of Germany"
in Herrick chapel,

“These elements." he went on‘.
“have been the basis of Hitler's
SUCCESS."

Two Souls

Kotschnig stated that Germany
consists of two souls: on one
hand. the thinker, poets, and phil-
osophers; on the other, the sol—
diers. He pointed out, however,
that these two souls cannot be
separated geographically: and
that introversion, femininity and
the inferiority complex character-
izes them both.

Because of these elements, he
said, Germany has always been a
country of strife.

Germany was not wholly res
sponsible for the World war, ac-
cording to Kotschnig, but her po«
litical inefficiency brought ruin
to herself. "The Republic couldn’t
stand up under the Treaty of
Versailles," he explained.

Constitution

The Weimar constitution came
along, he continued, bringing the
theory of universalism in politics
and the national community plan.
And with these came Hitler.

“His success was due to, first,
his personality, and, second, his
gospel and methods," Kotschnig
said.

Nose Injury Keeps
Guard on Sidelines
for Creighton Game

By “’ells Barnett:

The Pioneer cage team, fresh
from a string of three consecutive
conference wins in the last Week,
will attempt to add one more
Thursday when the Scarlet-clad
boys will meet Creighton univer-
sity at Omaha.

Tradition and history are all
against the Pioneers in this battle.
It will be the twenty-second game
between the two schools Since
they took up basketball relations.
Dul‘lng that time Grinnell has
won only once, and they have nev-
er been able to turn the trick at
Omaha On the other hand, the
Pioneers showed Such an increase

y scoring power
against Washburn Monday night
that anything can happen Thurs-
day.

The Washburn game didn't pro-
duce all happiness and joy, how-
ever, for in the first five minutes
of the second half Co-Captain Hal
Dean suffered a broken nose and
will not be able to play for the
rest of this week because of the
possibility of hemorrhages.

Dean’s loss Will be a serious
one, because of the fine brand or
basketball he has displayed in re-
cent games. He was especially a
standout performer while he was
in against Washburn, scoring 12
points, and playing a great de-
fensive game.

Dean's loss presents a problem
in reserve strength for coach
John Trdesdale. The most obvi-
ous solution of the problem is to
