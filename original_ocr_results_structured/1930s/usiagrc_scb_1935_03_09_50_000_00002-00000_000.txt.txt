TOO MUCH BOTHER?

The production of the intramural dance
contest last evening once more brings to minds
the perennial Pioneer Prudities controversy, as
it emphasises how inconsequential most of the ob—
lections to revival of the campus show were.

“It would take too much time," was one of
the most frequent plcas. But behold, with an
amazingly few practices most of the cottages last
night presented very acceptable dance routines,
and in one or two cases the dancing was every
bit polished enough to be made a part of a revue.

“Too expensive," others asserted. But
mark the costuming which was achieved at the
maximum expense of three dollars per skit in the
contest last night. The costumes were not PIOfESA

. sional in appearance—granted—but they would
suffice very nicely in a home talent production.
And as far as attracting an audience is concerned,
if the intramural contest could “pack ’em in" at a

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

This will probably be just another ston»:
thrown at the sun; but we still think that a Pion»

list of campus activities—and still consider the
“too much bother" excuse a pretty poor stall.

WAIt DECLARED 0N HUEY

By bringing the sentiment against Huey
Long’s campaign for national power into the
the open Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Joseph
T» Robinson did much more than manifest dis-
gust at the Kingfish's blustering in the Senate.
It was the first time since Long enlarged the
scope of’ his ambitions to include more than his
native state that his harangues have drawn pf—
ficial attention, but now that the ice has been
broken more official criticisms of Long’s tactics
may be expected. His opponents in the field of
national politics have ceased to laugh at his antics,
and that fact forbedes trouble for Mr. Long.

For some months now the possibility of
Long’s entry into the 1936 presidential race has
been predicted, and now it is accepted as a vir~
tual certainty. At first, his preparations for
candidacy were scoffed at and little importance at-
tached to the possible outcome of his high aspira-
tions. Just because he has installed himself as
dictator in Louisana does mean that he can
hoodwink the entire nation, it was reasoned . .
his critics are becoming more and more impressed ,
by his intuiti e knowledge of the common peo_

 

the potentiali es of his unflagging energy and the ’

his foes are beginning to wonder if u
tactics may not work in national as well
politics.

It is out of the question. of course, that ht.
could be considered a serious contender for the
1936 presidency, but it is not at all impossible that
he might form so powerful a third party as to
jeapordize the anticipated trend in the selection.
Strong third parties are a dangerous element in
an election, as neither of the major parties need
have pointed out; no doubt recognition of this
fact is at least partially responsible for the in~
creased seriousness with which Huey’s actions are
eyc .

.. If he continues to follow his current poli ies,
Long may very possibly make a costly slip; his
methods at times in the past have been highly
questionable, and there is no reason to believe
that he will abandon his strong-arm tactics in the
immediate future. He’d best watch his step from
now on, though. 'IWhile his clowning and rant-
ings were dismissed with a smile or a sneer every-
think was in his favor—ridicule does a man like
Huey Long very little harm. But his enemies
are in grim earnest now; they will let no oppor-
tunity pass to burst Huey's bubble and blot his
name out of the national political scheme. Sena-
tor Robinson's tirade was doubtless but the open»

To The Editor

Dear Editor:

It seems expedient at this time to
call to the attention of the women of
the college the exorbitant sum of ap.
proximately $175 that the social budget
con-mince is spending in bringing to
Grinnell two interpretive dancers of
supposed repute,
1 say “supposed" because it was
brought out at a recent mass meeting
that the fame of these dancers, Ludmila
Speranzeva and Vera Mirova, is un.
known to the women and to ever.
membersvof the committee.
If it is the belief of the oommitte.
that these dancers will add to the c '
,tur-al background of the women, 1 l
