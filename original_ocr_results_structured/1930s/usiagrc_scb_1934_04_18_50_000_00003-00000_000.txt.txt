Faculty Piano Duo

Wide Range of Selections

Presented on Program
by Ryan, MacDonald

By H, wi MATLACK

There are few artists who appear
iii our recital course about whom it
is more of a pleasure to spread good
news than Mrs. Ryan and Miss Mac-
Donald. lt is more or a pleasure
this year than ever. Continuous piano
duo playing for sevcral years hes:
brought their contrasting styles and
personalities into consoiiancc. Now
they play their two pianos with the
high degree of independence in phl'ass
ing, and unity in effect. that makes
two pianos sound like one, immense
ly expanded in its resources.

They have a big repertory, and
Thursday night they presented a
selection of choice music, old and
now, ranging from Mozart of the
eighteenth century to jazz of the
twentieth.

Mrs, Ryan and Miss MacDonald
are at their best in the better music,

and the better it is, the better they}
are. Nothing could be more classic-‘
ally fluent than Lhe Mozart piece
that opened tho program, to which
they gave just the fine moderation of
enthusiasm with restraint that marks
the eighteenth century style. Like»
wise they realized in full the vivid
contrasts in the Ruchmanlnoff suite,
and the mystic, almost morbid par-
adoxes in tlic “Poisoned Fountain,"
by the famous Engllsh iiiodcrii, Bax.

This is too lovely a composition to
have such a septic title, but whats

into a delicate gossamer of half-heard
tones and overtones, trembling now
and then when dreadful sounds rose
up rroin unseen depths.

To have music of the character
our colleagues chose, lincly
wrought into perfection right hero in
our midst is surely to be favored oil
the gods. When so much that has to
be listened to is halfrbaked, indif-
tercnt, unconipi-eliendcd, and not
worth the trouble it has cost to com-
pose or to learn. new greatly we owe
our own musicians the satisfaction
of knowing that we know how good
they are, that their music fills us
