Schlusnus Will
Give Baritone

Recital Monday

German Opera Singer Here
for Concert in 1927;
War Veteran

Heinrich Schlusnus, baritone with
the Royal Court opera of Berlin,

Germany, since 1911, will give a re» ,

cital in Herrick chapel Monday night
at 5 o’clock as the second number of
the Grihhell School of Music recital
course this year. This will be his.
second concert at Grime“, his ﬁrst
being presented Dec. 2. 1927.

The 1930-31 course of the School of
music opened With a recital by the
Loner String quartet Nov. 4, In ad-
dition to the Schlusnus recital, two
more numbers remain on the schedule.
Joseph Szigeti, Hungarian violinist,
will make his second appearance in
Grinnell den. 7, and Carlo Zecchi,
Italian pianist, will be heard for the
first time here March 10.

European Favorite.

Schlusnus, a European favorite,
sings with equal ease and effect in
English, French, Italian, and German.
His repertoire ranges from Bach to
the work of modern composers. The
Berlin Tagehlstt remarked of him.
“Schillshus' rare and unique art cl-
wnys draws a. large and representative
audience. His powerful baritone is so
warmly colored that nobody can re-
sist it."

The baritone was born in Brnubach,
Germany, and educated at Frankfort.
While still a boy at school he was
famous for his magnificent, ringing
voice and remarkable stage person-
slity. His musical training was inter-
rupted by Service in the World war,
but he returned to singing in 1915,
when a severe wound ended his ac-
tive War service.

Leading Singer Since 1911.

He has carried out a two year’s en-
gagement at the Nuerenburg Opera
house, appeared in the Royal Court
opera and Philharmonic in Berlin, and
given concerts in many other Euro-
pean cities,

Since 1917 -Scbiusnus has been
known as Berlin’s leading baritone.
“The public raved and roared and
forced him to sing a whole series of
encores,” commented the Ailgemeinc
Musikzeitung, a Berlin paper, in de—
scribing one of his concerts. The
Deutsche Allegemiene Zeitung, pub-
lished in the same city, declared- ‘A
song recital 'by Schlusnus is a genuine
treat. He is the German baritone who
comes nearest the Italian ideal, and
his voice is probably the most wonder»
ful to be heard today."

Porter Martin
Writes of Grid

Incidents Here

Football impressions and incidents
from Grihnell games in which he
played form the material for an art-
icle in the November issue of West-
ern Electric News by Porter L. Mar-
tin, 1925 Pioneer grid captain.

Martin is now employed in the
supervisory training department of
the industrial relations branch of the
Western Electrlc Company at Chl-
cago, When in college he was not on—
ly a, member cf the Grime“ Varsity
eleven, but was awarded a tackle
position on various mythical teams
for two years, including the ell-state,
all-Missouri Valley conference, and
all-Western, '

Footbnu Something Difficult

Games which “Port” mentions in.
clude the Grinnell-Iowa State home-
coming game of 1926, won by the Pio-
neers 14 to la, and considered by
Martin as the hardest game in which
he has ever played; the Drake game
in which Grinnell scored Lhree safe-
ties, but lost, 7 t0 6, and the tilt in
which Morgan Taylor, Olympics and
world champion hurdler, upon hear-
ing the gun at the half, tore down
the field without the ball as though
he was running a idoaynrd race,

That football teaches some things
not obtainable in the regular college
curriculum, is the idea brought out
in the article.

for Engraving

Juniors, Seniors Must Pay
for Cuts in Cyclone
With Pictures

All juniors and seniors expecting
to have their individual pictures in
the 1932 Cyclone must not only have
their pictures taken before Dec, 15,
but must also have paid their en-
graving fees before Christmas vhca<
tion. according to an announcement
made this afternoon by Kenneth Clay-
ton, editor.

The junior engraving fee is 31,50
for each student, while the seniors
are asked to pay $2.25 for the cost
of making individual cuts. Those who
have their pictures taken at the
Portrait-Art studios take care of this
with the cost,of their pictures. but
those who expect to use photos taken
at any other studio must deal directly
with staff members.

McDaniel Advertising Manager

Junior and seniors with the fee still
due are expected to see either Sue
Rocksfellow or Fillmore Gwynne:
Vaughan at once. Since it will be
nearly impossible for these two to see
the individual students of each class,
the upper classmen will be expected
to make a point of getting in touch
with them to complete arrangements
for the publication of pictures.

The editor of the yearbook also an-
nounced that the taking of group pic—
tures would begin immediately follow-
ing Christmas vacation, while the pics
[lites of the building and cottage resi-
dents will be completed next week.

"The hair of the moustache

Fund of Norris
Provides Help
to 1 65 Students

Graduating Classes Increase
Maltese Cross Amount
to sum of $14,017

Graduating classes have contributed
34,017 to the Madtese Cross Student
Loan fund since its establishment in
1925 by D. w. Norris, '95. L. v.
Phelps, Grinnell college treasurer,
said this afternoon. The fund at pres-
ent amounts to 514,017, and 155 stu-
dents have received help from it.

Mr. Norris, a resident of California
and owner of the Morshalltown
Times—Republican of Marshalltown,
1a., gave 310,000 to Grinhell college
in 1925 to be called the “Maltese
Cross Student Loan Fund." The gift
win to be used both as an endowment
for the college and as a loan fund '
for students.

Signatures Only security

students were to borrow money
from the Norris' fund with only their
signatures as security. The interest
which they paid on loans was to re-
vert to the college in the some way
as the interest from endowment funds
devoted to bond or real estate invest-
mcnts.

When he made the grant, Mr,
Norris said that he wished that the
fund would be augmented by the gifts
of graduating students in order that
it would be: as he explains in a recent
letter to Mr. Phelps, “a helping hand
extended by one generation of stu-
dents to another, and )y one class
to another."
Thoroughly Student

”A student in Grinnell college,"
Mr. Norris continued in his letter,
"receives $400 more in service than he
pays for in t, on in four years. He
should have an opportunity to return
a small part of that gratuity after
he has an income from his own work
in society.”

He Said of the fund in his letter:
“When over 150 young people are
enabled to help themselves to get
their education, this plan is Worth
while, ,

“If each graduating class would
make a contribution to this fund in
the form of personal pledges payable
over a short period of years after
graduation, the Maltese fund could be-
come on outstanding institution in
Crinnell college. It would be of the
students, for the students, and by
the students; a helping hand extended
by one generation to another,

as Students Paid Lolms

“Those who do not have to borrow
enjoy that privilege as a rule because
of no effort of their own. Someone
else has paid for their education.
Having received so much, it ought to
become a great privilege to outgoing
students to be able to add to a fund
that will help others to follow them."

The amount allowed 9. Student from
the fund may be as much as 5350, ac-
cording to Mr. Phelps. 0f the 165
students who have used the fund, 58
have paid their loans.
