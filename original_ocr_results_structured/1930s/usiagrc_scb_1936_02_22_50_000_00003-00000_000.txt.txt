Evans Named
New Auditor

Appoinhnent Announced
by Student Council

Dayl Evans ‘37, was appointed
student auditor to fill the vacancy
created by the recent resignation
of John Sukett ’36, according to
Kent Duncan, president of the
Student Council.

“Sackett resigned because he
was not able to devote the hour
and a half each (lay to the job that
is required under the new system
of auditing student hooks,which
has been drawn up and approved
by the faculty," Duncan said in
explaining the appointment.

Meeting Wednesday

At a special Student Council
meeting Wednesday night, a list at
tentative candidates was consldr
ered, and Duncan was appointed to
consult with Mrr Louis V. Phelps
and Mr. Shelton L. Beatty as to
the qualifications of the various
men.

The post of student auditor will
become for the first time a half
board job as the result of the new
plan drawn up by the student
Council. Under the proposal,
which was accepted by the faculty
in December, tlle auditor will be
paid by three parties, the Student
Council, the college and the variv
ous student organlzations. Ezch
will contribute one-third of the
expenses of the office.

Auditor Has ﬁlm-e Power

The new plan also increases the
power of the student auditor over
that of his predecessors. giving
him power to request student
treasurers to present their book‘s
for audit, and if they do not com-
ply satisfactorily, the power to
recommend the guilty party to the
faculty committee on student or_-
ganizations and publication [or in»
eligibi ty, In such a case the reg
istrar is authorized to withhold all
credits from the offending treas-
urer until such times as he or she
presents the books in a. satisfac-
tory manner.

With the appointment of Evans.
the final step in the installation of
the new auditing system will be—
gin, and it is expected that he will
shortly call a meeting of all cams
pus treasurers and explain to them
the requirements of the new sys
tem, according to Duncan.
