We understand that it is oftiu s
Morgan‘s custom to entertain lictty
in the woods by giving impromptu

- nnitntions of Turznn. He has even
been known to take to the trees
on occasion which brings up a
problem tor the homily department.
\i'hcre does Morgan iind a giant
California Redwood tree in Iowa?

Speaking of trees reminds us of
Iilhe Duval_ It seems that she got
p into a tree outside one of the col-
-ge executive’s windows and then
ouldn‘t get down. Lusty yells even-
ally got results but the executive
.nsidered the whole affair highly un-
igniried.

A hint to those who are unemployed

en’s varsity club books for this se-
ester and find a. house that needs

LINES TO THE PUBLIC AT
LARGE: Brown and Relston some.
times play a game like London
.ridge, particularly at high noon
own by the women’s tennis courts
. . . Wiley Arnold and the World
air beauty like to hold hands as
they walk from the ARE to the
quad otter their morning classes
. . . Snap James is often seen with
a frying pan and Larry, bound for
the wilderness . i . Rinadreds of
other couples are often seen with-
ut a frying pan but humid for the
wilderness just the same . . . The
nudist colony on the loggia roof
has at inst managed to acquire a
light sunburn . . . Kelsey worries
nore about the blisters on his sun-
burned beck than he does about
anything else . . . Ellet Drake is
back in school after a long illness.
. . . Bert Holmes likes mountain
music . . . Mary Hall thinks that
. reddie Kerr’s wearing apparel
hould be augmented when he wears
linen pants and especially on sunny
.ays. . .

Ike McWelhy's arc lamp on second

ith the evening tea parties in the
tadium. It makes the blankets on
e grass look like ink spots on a
n-watt light bulb. The secret of suc-
ess is to get between the track and

Then there’s the case of the
oung man who always went pie—
nicking in the stadium with his girl.
One day he announced he would go
on no more such affairs because he
hated to go over the same ground
twice.

'Summer is almost here which gives

nree months to think up some new
cries to tell to thc admiring public

The funniest sight of this week
was to see Baron Filbert struggling
to climb a tree after a misplaced
sweater and still keep the poise
proper to such a distinguished
game-hunter. The {cat was ﬁnally
accomplished with Cooper assisting
and the Baron retired, worm but
triumphant. ,

Critic Applauds
Memorial Plays

(Continued from Page one)

Irwin Oxley as 'Me,” Dorris Long
as “You," and Don Ross, transformed
by some queer alchemy into the
“Wolf at the door," contributed their
full shares to the many laughs of the
play. Truly Trousdale in the part of
"Hope,” brought back her parents,
“Me“ and “You," from “over the hill
to the poorhouse," whither Depress~
ion and the wolf had driven them.
Mary Frances Nye spoke the pro-
logue, and Laura Matousek as Music
Maker, successfully chimed in with
appropriate tunes to the numerous
platitudes which formed the struc-
ture or the play.

Miss Ewaldt’s play, “What's the
Use!" would probably be better re-
ceived by on Eastern audience than
by Iowans who are too close to the
farmers’ troubles to gain a clear per-
spectlve of the case. This play skile
fully portrayed a cross section of
farming drama which is actually
being enacted at the present time.
The unusual setting of almost total
darkness, relieved only by the flicker.
ing lantern lights, was particularly
effective for this type of production.

, outstanding Actiuil

Although the play was slow to get
under way, there were outstanding
hits of action which helped to dispel
this objection. An inconsiderate train
which whistled its way through some
of the most important lines, and a
stage "automobile” whose engine be.
gan running before the driver-was yet
off the stage, were obstacles which
were dismissed by the audience in
their intense interest in the play.

Realistic bits of acting were done
by William Sanford, David Phillips,
Robert Irwin, and Richard Schaen.
The latter, who had the part ot a
blusteriog deputy, did not give a par»
ticularly sympathetic interpretation,
but it was a neat satirizing of “the
Law.” Another good performance
was that of Don Arnold-s, whose
Swedish accent hid his identity from
even his best friends. Smaller parts
were well taken by William Pryor,
Albert Rose, and Virgil Giddings.

Settings by Rhyusblu‘ger

Setting and costume designs for
the three plays were by Chris Rhyns-
burger, who also directed "Shades of
Cottonlips." Miss Ewoldt and Mr.
Birdsall directed their own plays, un-
der the general supervision of Mrs,
Sara Sherman Pryor, director of
dams.

Sophus Hansen was technical di-
rector, assisted by Robert M, Brown,
Emalee Matousek, Charlotte Gather,
and Hope Blevans. stage manager
was Harry Allen, assisted by Eleanor
Weeks.

Psychiatrist Says Discord
in Home Causes Insanity

PHILADELPHIA, Pa, (CNS)—
one million or more school children,
now normal, will become at least
mildly insane during some period of
their lives because of discord in their
homes and over-emphasis on text—
book knowledge in school, Dr, Ken-
neth E. Appel, University of Pennsyl-
vania psychiatrist, predicted this
week.

“Much of this mental instability
will be due to parental discord, which
is all too common in the American
home,” he declared.

PERSONALS

Josephine Bilharz was takcn to
Community hospital today, suffer—
ing from a severe case of sunburn.

John Shields, '30, who received his
master’s degree in business at Har-
vard in 1932, has been transferred
