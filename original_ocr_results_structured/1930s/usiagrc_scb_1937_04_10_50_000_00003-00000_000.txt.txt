Girls’ Glee Club Concert Wins
Approval of Audience

Reviewer Enjoys Spirit
of Hungarian Songs;
Solos Add Variety

By E. WALTER HUFFMAN

There could not possibly have
been a disappointed person in the
large audience which attended the
30th annual home concert of the
Crinnell college Girls' Glee club
Thursday evening. Even if one
were without ears to hear, the
charming stage arrangement and
the symphony of color which
greeted the eyes from the varies
gated gowns would have in them»
selves been worth many times the
price of admission But the cons
cert afforded considerably more
than sensuous appealeit revealed
a group of singers who had an in—
tellectual grasp of musical values,
who knew what they wanted to
do and how to do it. The discrimi-
nating listener could readily find
much to make him happy.

The Club was particularly cttec-
tive in parts of the “Medley of
Southern Songs," the Hungarian
follcsong “See the Gypsy Munch~
illg Cheese," the “Chorus of the
Country Girls" from “Eugene one
girl," the “Spinning Chorus" from
the “Flying Dutchman,” and the
"Gianina Nia" from Friml’s "Fire-

“particularly felt in the animated
singing of the two Hungarian
folk-songs.

Variety was added to the pres
gram through an instrumental
trio by Lois Wahl, Rathrine Made
son, and Eleanor stecn, a solo by
Miss Madsori, a duet by Dorothy
Kozelka and Ann Coplerud, air in-
cidental solo by Rita Phelps and
a solo by Mary Fox. The merits
or these talented performers are
known to Grinnell audiences and
it is hardly necessary to add that
they were well received. Several
responded with encm'es.

This year’s club undoubtedly
possesses a large numner of very
fine voices. Thls was apparent in
thc quallty of the individual sec-
tions and in the ensemble. EVI—
dcnces of careful training were to
be noted in the diction, tlic phras-
ing, the fusion of the tone and the
restraint with which fortissimo
passages were handled.
