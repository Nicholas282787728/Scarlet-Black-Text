The conference meet at .
Louis will bring down the curtain
of another year in the history of
Pioneer athletic annals. One more
year of competition remains in the
Missouri valley, and We wonder
what fate awaits our football.

their last efforts against some
of the toughest opposition in the
midlands.

There was an air of optimism
in the Pioneer football camp last
fall, but at the end of the season
the grid warriors had only an-
nexed two victories against six
defeats anti one tie. They never
were the same after the heights
the squad reached in that never~

battle. with the exception of the
Drake contest, which was an over-
match, the boys gave a fairly
good account of themselves hut
were usually on the short end of
the score.

main problem will he to find
sufficient man power, as gradua-
tion has depleted the .ranks
severely. Spring practice was dis-
heartening heoanse of the small
turnout, and the prospects for
next year appear to he none too
good. We venture to state, how-
ever, that if "Lookie" can get a
squad of thirty men out that will
show some real enthusiasm for the
game, the Pioneers will turn in
s more creditable record than they
did last fall.

The cngcrs had in every way
a potential championship aggrega-
tion, and it was definitely the
year the Pioneers should have
cashed in. They seemed to hit a
snag after their smashing triumph
over the championship Aggies and
never quite played the hall they
were capahle of. ,In the final con»
ference standings, they finished
with seven victories and the same
number of defeats.

Goad: Trnesdaie will have three
veterans from the starting lineup
to greet him along with a very
promising crop of freshmen. They
should have another strong team,
hut it will he facing other teams
in the conference that will have
the same lineups as last season.
Despite the stronger opposition,
the Pioneers will have the stuff
to finish in the first division if
they have learned their lessons
from the past.

s - s i,

Co-capmins John Hayward and
Lynn Schlotterbeck have been
the leading stars on the track
squad for over two years, and
their losses will he felt keenly by
Coach Duke and his thinclads.
With these two exceptions, most
of the team will be returning.
With their continued improvement
and added experience, some of the
relay teams might develop into
championship form. Only one or
two freshmen showed any promise
this spring, so it will he a. prob—
lem to get more material capable
of rounding out the balance of
the squad.
