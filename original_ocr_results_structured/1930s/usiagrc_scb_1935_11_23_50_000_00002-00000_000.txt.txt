Football victories were scarce in
1914 and beatings were severe, but
the following year found a new
coach at Grinnell, and new varsity
material in the sophomore class
formed the backbone of three of
Grinnell‘s most successful team,
those of 1015, 1916 and 1017.

vei-sity of Minnesota. His iirst

The war played havoc with the
1918 schedule as the team only en-
gaged in three encounters. They
lost to Dubuque and Coe, hut

largest score ever made in c
Drake-Grinnell game

At the close or this season Gri -
nell was admitted to the Missouri
valley conference ,which then con-
tained such teams as Nebraska,
Kansas, Missouri and Iowa state.

The 1010 season was disastrous
as the squad lost {our games, while
winning from cos and tying Cor-
nell, 7-7. The next year saw W. H.
‘Saundel's at Grinnell as football
coach. His inst team won three,
lost three and tied one. The fol-
‘lowing year Grinnell won two and
lost five. That was all for Mr.
Saunders.

ward, and his 1022 team won three
games while losing fiv They beat
Parsons, st Louis on 'ersity and

started off the season with wins
over Parsons and Washington, but
then lost the six remaining games
‘on the schedule to‘Oornell, Drake,

“Mike" ‘Hylahd «'was appointed

Grinnell embarked on three suc-
‘cessful seasons. In his first sea-
son his tecm broke even by whip-
ping Washingon, .Coe and Amos,
while losing to Cornell, Drake and
Creighton. The largest margin oi

Should Eat 2300 Calories

, The average student should eat
between 2300 and 2800 calories a
day to keep his weight even; for
brcakiast, fruit, cereal, two slices
of toast with jam and coffee or
milkiscﬂ calories; lunch, what we
usually get7800 more; and dinner,
1200.

Add to that about 400 extra in
the morning for a roll and coiiee or
a candy bar, 400 more in the after-
noon ior a coca cola with maybe a
hamburger on the sldep and you
get the answer to the added
pounds, which equal inches around,
which brings about uncomfortable
tightness in formals or anything
else. All qf which brings about
