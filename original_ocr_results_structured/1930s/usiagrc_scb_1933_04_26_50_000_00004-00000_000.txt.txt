Penn Varsity
Downs F rosh
in Dual Meet

Wet Track Slows Runners;
Burrows, Rogers High
Point Men

By scoring nine out of a possible
14 first places the Penn college vars-
ity track squad Dvenvhelmed the
Grinnell freshman team 74 to 49 on
the Ward field track Monday after-
noon.

A heavy shoiver immediately pre-
ceding the meet hindered the runners
and some of the field events, and as
a result many of the records are be»
low those capable of the men compet-
ing.

Burrous, Rogers High

Parke Burrows,\Dibble hall fresh-
man, and Rogers. Penn sprinter.
were high point men for the meet,
each scoring two firsts. Burrows
heaved the discus 114 feet. despite
the slippery ground that made his
footing unsure. He also took the shot-
put with a heave of 39 feet 6 inches,
Rogers took first places in the 100
and 220-yard dashes.

(Jo-captain Knapheide, of the fresh—
man group, was third in the high
scoring race with eight points, earn-
ed from the high jump and the low
hurdles Jim Langias scored a first
in the broad jump and two thirds in
the hurdle races to rank next in the
individual scoring.

Barnes outstanding

Probably the outstanding single
performance of the meet was made
by Don Barnes, fle’ct»footed quarter-
miler,’ in the mile relay When the
baton was handed to him as anchor
man he was .at a twenty-yard dis»
advantage and after the first 220
yards, he began a sprint that lacked
only a few yards of making up the
necessary distance to win the race.
He placed first in the loo-yard run
previous to the relay.

\The entry list for the Drake relays
continues to soar, having reached
over 100 schools from all parts of the
country. Nine members of the West—
ern conference, all Big Six schools
and the major institutions from
seven states will be represented.
High schools are represented from
seven states. Friday will he the first
day for the relays, with most of the
preliminaries being held at this time,
and the meet will be completed Satv
urday.

Captain Mike Pilbrow seems to be
Grinnelrs major hope for an out-
standing performance, being entered
in his specialty, the two—mile
run, So far this season ”Iron Mike"
has not been defeated in this event,
and will be running in his first major
competition of the year when he ap-
pears Saturday,

so».

Despite the fact that they were
opposing a varsity team and that
min made footing rather precar-
ious. the Griniiell frcslunon truck
candidates performed better than
would be expected of an average
first year team. Severnl members
of the team are going to make star
pcriormcrs for the varsity next
year. With seemingly littlc cffort
Parke Burrons heaved the discus
114 feet to place first in that event.
By taking first in the shot put he
shared honors for high individual
score with Rogers. Penn sprinter.

Another prep, Jim Langlas, seems
to be quite diversified in his compe-
tition. scoring points in both the
hurdles and in the broad jump.
Probably the outstanding perform-
ance of the meet was extended by
Don Barnes, quarter—miler, who ran
anchor man for the preps in the mile-
relay. With the baton. he was given

‘ a 20 yard disadvantage. and after

a heart-breaking sprint, he lacked

. only a few feet to win at the tape.

HAD you
when running agruist Iowa last
Saturday, Don Barhcr scored the
best time or his career for the two-
mile ruin—that Joe I’ojmiul can be
given a lot of credit for winning
the Iowa .mcet, due to 'his timely
entry in the half-mile run: even
though he had not been entered in
this event since his high school
competition—that hard ball is
scheduled to start immediately of-
tcr the ldtteuball season, and that
golf is being considered as an intru-
inural sport.

pare for next fall‘s eight—game

team has ever been called upon to

Intermittent had weather and the
spring vacation prevented the squad
from concentrating on its mastery of
more than a score of new plays, as
well as the fundamentals of the
game,

Sensational Puiiters

A few silver linings, however. man-
aged to penetrate the cloud. chief of
these are the improvemcnt in the
kicking strength of the squad. which
now looms as the greatest aggrega»
ticn of punters and place kickers in
Creighton history. and the sensation-
al progress made by a half-dozen
spring candidates,

Among these stand-outs are three
sophomores who will be well up on
the list when starting assignments
are given out next fall, the coach in-
dicated. They are Paul Schmidt,
184~pollnd halfback from Spearville.

After College-What Then?

 

JAMES NORMAN HALL

or the men and women who have
gone out from Grinnell to make a
name for themselves as writers, Odie
tors, and authors, James Norman
Hall, 1910. is one of the most out-
standing.

From his home in Papecte. Tahiti,
lSocicty Islands, he contributes regu-
larly to leading magazines, and is
known for his books: “Kitchener's
Mob,” “High Adventure,” “Faery
Lands of the South Seas." "On the
stream of Travel," "Mutiny on the
Bounty."

Writes of Griiuiell

Because of the unusual and inter-
esting life Mr. Hall has lived in the
South seas, he was asked to write
something of his experiences, He
asked, instead, to be permitted to
write his opinion of Grinncll. It is
this—

”If I were now a young man. pre-
pared to enter college, and knowing
what I do of colleges and universities,
cast and west, north and south, what
would be the college of my choice?
I can say. without a moment's hesi-
tation, that I would again choose
Grinnell

Increases Living Capacity

“There appears to he a widespread
feeling in these iatte-r days that the
primary function of a college is to
develop and increase a young man's
earning capacity. In my opinion, no
more mistaken conception coidd be
held.

It is the duty of a,college worthy
of the name to develop and increase
a young man's living capacity; to
teach him the true value of the in-
estimable gift of life and how to
make the most of it. This is what
Grinnell college did for me . . . and
I can never be sufficiently grateful
that four of the most precious years
of my life were spent in a college
where the fine art of living—the
highest of all the arts—was. pro-
fessedly and actually, taught.

oives Education to Grinncll

“I would not give up a certain at
titudc toward life. instilled into me
during my years at Grinhell, for all
the wealth reputed to have been in
King Solosou's mines. Such colleges
as Grinnell . . . rightly lreep the elnr
phasis in education where it belongs:
upon life itself rather than upon the
ways and means of earning a livcli-
hood. Fortunate is the young man
who chooses such a college for his

to be an educated man. But what
education I have I owe to Grinnell
college, and had I been capable of
receiving more. she had more and to
spare to give me. But this I count
the chief item in the incalculable
debt I owe the college: that I learned
to value what the best men of all
times have held worthy of high esti-
mation. And I further learned that
the four years of a college education
is a mere beginning, a preparation for
the education still to come. This fur-

Grinhell college, I have never lost my
zest for it."
