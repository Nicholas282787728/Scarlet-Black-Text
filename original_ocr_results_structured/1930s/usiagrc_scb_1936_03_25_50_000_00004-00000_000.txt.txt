HOW ABOUT REORGANIZING?

Mid—semesters are over, and some of us

didn’t do so Well, However, that is all past
now and the question is what about finals?
_ Every year the midnight oil is burnt far
into the morning as students hastily endeavor
to cram enough facts into overtired heads to
assure their passing the three hour final exr
amlnation, It‘s tedious work, and the out,
come is not always so pleasant, as many will
testify; yet the system continues. Why,
may we ask?

Because most students are not very well
organized. They do not see the value of do-
ing a. little work each day and gradually as-
similating a lot of material which will require
only a brief polishing before the exam. In-
stead most of us see fit to idle away our time
duringr the semester and then have to “turn
on the heat” when finals roll around. It
isn’t so bad in mid-winter when the distrac-
tions are not so numerous, but when June
comes, it becomes difficult indeed,

Why not then stop and do a little sclfgang
nlyzing and see what yoll have been missing?
It’s not too late for a reorganization of study
methods for this semester audit certainly
will pay dividends when the semester finals
roll around.

HATS OFF !

Hats off to the Grillncil Drama depart-
ment! ,

_For the performance of “No Women Want-
ed” on Monday night, the members of the de—
partment deserve nothing but the highest
praise. The production was above the aver-
age college play and it moved along with a
swiftness which too often did not permit the
audience to g "lsp the clever lilies.
Nevertheless it was not only a clever farce,
reflecting great credit upon. the author Mr.
Davidson, but also gayc the individual mem-
bers an opportunity to show real acting abil-
ity.

The production was undoubtedly the best
to be staged by the department thi year, and
all of those who participated ill the prepara—
tion of the show are to be congratulated for
making the college stage worthwhile on the
Grillnell campus.

hNOw YOURSELF
(Daily O’Coilegian)

American visitors to England are often much
impressed by the fact that why cottage, every
homc outside the great city areas, has an cucloscu
gal-och. usually at the back, an outdoor living room
where the family can enjﬁy a decent privacy as real
as (lint within the house. Thc typical American
luwh on the other hzmu, is not enclosed. Often in
mail cannot distinguish where his land approaches
the property of his neighbor. This uiffcrcucc in
gardens is significant of u difference in thc Ameri~
ccm uml England philosophies o[ life,

Thc Englishman lives in c crowded world. He
is compelled to rub clbcws continually with his
fellows—‘therc are so many of them. His genius has
consequently developeu in social rather than mar
challical knowledge. Hc haul to learn, in order to
survive, how to get along with Others. But his so
cial wisdom has impressed upon him the necessity of
privacy. The man who can enrich his life in the sc-
clusion and pcucc of his own garden is most iihcly to
live wiscly among his fellow . Hc has the physical
requisites of developing himsclf. And he has the
precious opportunity to hc alone in a beautiful place.

The college student would up well to consider
the lesson of the English gartlelh Instead of stl‘ivV
lhg so 'cnously fci- personality, for social I'ecognlr
lion and the mammals of popular success, he had
much better make sum of himsclf. And one can
shut out the world occasionally and hc with enthu-
siasm that which he really is, who has a gal-och in
which hc czm ciucy liimscli‘, that one most likely
to develop that sclf i-cspcct which is c.,chtml to sag
cial distinction. Aha self respect, like all cthci
killds of respect, is based upon lmowlcugc (lull accep-
