House Presidents
View Constructive
Improvement Days

The Council of House Presidents,
men’s governing body, Thursday
set Oct. 21 and 22 for the annual
freshmen “Improvement Days"
this fall.

At its first meeting, the coun-
cil decided to continue the policy
of injecting more constructive
improvement and less “hell" into
the program, which is more com-
monly referred to as freshman
“Hell Week."

William Pedersen, president of
Macy house, was appointed to the
freshman committee which is
composed of Charles Bear, presi-
dent of Carney house, Robert
Ferguson, president of Dibble hall
and Lloyd Pierce, president of
Gates.

Bear was appointed head of a
committee to investigate subjects
for men's intramural debate pro-
gram.

One of a group of questions
submitted by the committee to
the council will he decided upon
at the next meeting.

Each house president was asked
to recommend to his respective
house council that a budget for
the year be prepared in order to
facilitate a better control over
house funds.

Much of the thin-clad hopes de-
pend upon the development of
last year's standouts, Fell and
Wczesny.
