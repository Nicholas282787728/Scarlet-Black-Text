Ichabod Team
Unprediclable "

Blue-\Vhite Eleven
Presents Open Game
With Many Latel‘als

By Clark A. Smith

Down at Topeka, Kansas, they
call washburn college's football‘
team the “Fighting Ichabods" and
this year they have certainly givA
en proof that they deserve that
name.

To date, in six games. their ol-
fense has scored 107 points in
winning four of the games. Their
latest victory was just a week
ago in a conference game when
they upset the highly tevored Ok-
lahoma Aggies, 14-0.

zoo-Pound Linc.

Washburn has all the physical
factors that go into making a
fine team, mainly weight and
speed. Their line averages 200
pounds and it will he the biggest
forward wall the Pioneers will}
face all year. The backs are
lighter but of the speedy, triple-
threat type that throw a defense
into a dilemma.

Ralph Brady at fullback, is a
colored boy that will hear watch-
irlg Saturday. He does everything
well and is rated as one of the
best lacks in the sunflower statc.
Teaming with this senior in the
hackfield is a sophomore half-
back by the name of Wally
Schroeden At washburn they say
this about him: “A coach’s dream.
This tl'lplerdistilled, soryard punt-
ing, tensecond sprinting, bullet~
‘passing soph back is expected to
make everyone sit up and take no-
tice.” so far this season, he has
done just that.

Many Laterels Expected

The lchabods run their plays
from a single or double wing back
follnation and also punt forma-
tion. Their offense contains many
un-orthodox and tricky formations
that keep the opposition in a
qualldry as to what to expect.
Gni’mell fans will see plenty of
“mule-dazzle" football from
Washhurn as they always are do-
ing the unexpected and playing
an open game with many laterals,

There can he no doubt that the
Pioneers will have their hands full
Saturday afternoon. 0n the basis
of comparative records of both
teams, the battle rates nothing
but a toss-up. Wasliburn is also
handicapped by lack of reserves,
so the game promises to he a dog
tight to the very end between
two very evenly matched teams

RANDOM
SPORT SHOTS

By Clark Smith

Those of you who saw the cere-
mony before the Drake game last
week were probably surprised to
know there was a traditional "Old
Oaken Bucket" that went to the
winner of each Bulldog-Pioneer
game. About 12 years ago it was
inaugurated as a symhol of vic-

 

tory, with the score of each year's
game burned into the wood. 1926
and 1932 are the only years the
bucket has been in Grinnell's
possession, which is probably just

the reaoii we know so little about
it

wiislibiu-n can thank its loothall
comeback trom last years winless
season to 16 husky sophomores,
These boys ousted a good share of
the 12 returning lettermen from
their starting positions in the line-
up, They have served notice to the
rest of the conferenc that in the
future tlic Tcliabods are going to
take their football seriously,
v 2 e

Their record shows that Wash-
burn has a dangerous offense but
a vulnerable defense, despite the
zooepound average in the line:

Washburn 34, Baker 0.

Waslihurh 19, Emporia Teachers
6.
Washburn 14, Kansas U. 58,
Washburn 20, Colorado college 0
Washhurn 6, Wichita 35.
Washhurn 14, Oklahoma A&M o,
Grinncll will have another tough
team on its hands a week from

.todsy when it opposes a rapidly

improving ,Coe team at Cedar
Rapids. Last week Coe gave
Carleton a 3377 lacing as a “birth—
day gift" to its coach, Moray Eby.
The Pioneers are hoping the grat-
uitous spirit of their state rivals
will have passed away by Armis-
tice day.
