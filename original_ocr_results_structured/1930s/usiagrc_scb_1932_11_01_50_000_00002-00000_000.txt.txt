PIONEER CHEST CAMPAIGN

BEGINS

Tomorrow will min the begin-
ning of another Pioneer Chest
flrive, ll campaign by which neces-
sary funds will he raised for the
carrying on of Grinnell-in-Chiilc
and the Young Men ’s and Young
Women’s Christian associations of
Grinnell for another year.

The function of the Y. M. C‘. A.
and Y. W. C. A. is ilo longer to
hold Weekly Bible study meetings
—lllthough a lot of us could stand
a little of that—but is primarily
service.

Perhaps the greatest service
these organizations perform is
that of looking after a number of
Grinnell’s less fortunate children
athl-ollgh the Uncle Sam‘s club.
An annual Christmas party is
given for tllesc youngsters and zl
number of men and women devote
their Sunday afternoons to the
club.

GrinnellrinChina was establish-
ed 20 yams ago, when a boy’s
school was founded in chhow ill
Shantung, The college and church
collected cllollghhloney to start
the school, after A. B. DcHzllln,
'06, returned from missionary
service in China and presented 8.
plan to the students and faculty
to interest them ill establishing
Sllcll It School. The school has high
school rating and many graduates
have later come to Grillnell col.
lege.

THE "STAGS"

Since, the recent inauguration of
weekly dances ill the Recreation
room. there have been large
crowds attending on Wednesday
evenings

However, one suggestion is to be
made at the request of the W07
men’s League board. S0 for, a
number of men have attended the
dances without bringing dates
and consequently resorted to the
practice of “cutting in.”

Since this practice makes it un-
pleasant for those who do bring
dates and since it is not practic-
able for the other girls to attend
the dances by themselves, is it not
only fair to ask tlle “Stags” to
invite some of the many girls who
therefore have to stay away?

Sli‘l‘dly, fewer Stags would work
out more satisfactorily all ilroulld.

MORE SWIMM'ERS

Prc-season Workouts for mem-
bers and potential members of thc
Grinnell college varsity swimr
millg team are now being held by
Coach Elton A. Rosen. Yet, only
a few men are reporting to lliln,
These men are possibly the
strongest prospects in school, but
ill view 0f the fact that only af-
ter ll great deal i work and or»
rangcmcnt has G innell been able
to support a swimming team this
year, it is imperative that more
swimmers rcport for training.
Conch Roseil states that the pre-
season workouts have already
improved the time of several of
the veterans, and surely those
who intend to try for the team
lotcr should report new in order
to benefit by the present practice
sessions.

VALUE OF EDUCATION
Carnegie moan

hlihough the average college
gmdunle is supposedly too idealistic
to consider the financial benefit of an
education when he is unswering thct
old question, "Why I Came to C01-
legs." there will probably be quite a
few who will be interested to know
that Willinm Atherton Du Puy. the
eminent statistician has estimated
that the pecuniary value of n college
education amounts to $65,000.

While the high school graduate
may expect to earn only $110,000 dur-
ing his life span, the college gradu-
nte will earn $175,000 according to
the report of Mr. Du Pcy, executive
assistant at the department of inter-
ior, who has just completed a statis—
tical study of the power of cducn-
tion.

At 18 the high school graduate
ems $800 in contrast to thb boy with
only grade school training. He will
net an annual income of $1,500 at 22
which repremts the maximum of the
average income of it man with gram~
ninr school education. The college
graduate begins to earn ct the age of
22, reports Mr. Du Puy, without thir-
ing into account the abnormal condi-
tions due to the depression. He starts
Off at about $1,400, which is less than
the high school graduate rnakos at
the same age, because the'latter has
been working for years, The college
gmduate's income rises rapidly by
the time he reaches 26 years of age,
but that of the high school graduate
mounts more slowly. When the two
ore between the ages of 43 and is,
the college man's income usually
comes in a. point of rapid increase and
the high school trained man's income
is stationary and his momentum is
slackened. When the college mnn
reaches so he is earning 54,000 a. year,
End at 70 his income drops to $3,500.
