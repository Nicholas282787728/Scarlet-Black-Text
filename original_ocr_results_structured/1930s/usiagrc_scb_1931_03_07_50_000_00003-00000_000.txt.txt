Women to Debate
Chicago Proposal
in Cottage Series

Quadrangle intramural debates will

Crinnell college should adopt the Chi-
cago university plan." Under this
proposal no grades are given, and the
college course may be completed in as
few or as many years as desired.

tis, Central’s team, will uphold the
negative against Mary Kent and

HEN the winds begin to

blow, you'll know that
spring is on its way. And
when they blow, you need
berets to hold down those
straying locks of hair. But
have you seen the new tur-
ban berets at BRINT-
NALL'S? They fit the need
to perfection. Inexpensive
enough at too to have one
for every costume.

SOME one is always asking

iwhel'e did you get it?
The new formal, of course,
SPURGEON’S have the exact
ones you desire, Delicious

old one you can discard. A
new one to take its place.

They're the latest in style.

tunate ones whose make-
up comes off every minute or
so? Are you always drag-
ging out the compact and lip—
stick to add that finishing
touch? The whole world
looks to Paris for styles and
beauty. Why don't you turn
French and use Louis Phil-
lipe's ‘Angelus Rouge Incar-
nat', the nearest thing to a
permanent make-up yet dis-
covered, for lips and cheeks
