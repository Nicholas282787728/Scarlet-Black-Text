‘No Invitation
Sent’—Strong

St. Louis U. Not Invited

to Join Valley Loop

“No imitation has been extend
ed to St, Louis university, St. Lour
is, Me, to join the Missouri Valley
confereuCe,‘_’ Professor Earl D.
Strong, Conference secretary, de-
clared last night in an interview.

“The recent newspaper stories

concerning the extending of such
an invitation to St, Louis are not
true, to the best of my knowledge,"
he explained. “Any such invitation
would have to be sent by me as
secretary t_o the Conference, and I
havetakcn no such action.
'_‘7The matter of inviting St. Lollr
is to join the Conference has been
discussed infrequently during the
past few years, but nothing defi-
iiite has been done about it. At the
annual meeting of the Conference
officials, held last spring at Tulsa,
Okla, the matter was again
brought up, but nothing was decid-
ed," Mr. strong asserted.

At present the Missouri Valley
conference has a membership of
seven schools, which includes
GrinnelL Drske, Tulsa, Oklahoma
A. 6: M., Washburn, Creighton and
Washington. Wsshburn and Tulsa
are not completing their first full
year as members of the Confer-
ence, having been admitted in the
spring of 1934. '

Pioneers Meet

(Continued from page 1)

the year they held the 1935 sur-
prise powerhouse outfit from Cor-
nell college to a 0»o tie.
Tutors use Tricky Offense

The Teachers employ an unbal»
anced line with a z formation, of-
fensive tactics which have always
baffled the Grinnell defense. Drake
used this type of play last Satur»

 

day and kept the Pioneers won-
dring what it was all about.

Grinnell emerged from Satur-
day’s scrap with Drake with three
had injuries. Ricky Boller, 1357
pound end, suffered a serious bone
biiiise on the inner surface of his
right knee, while Sehlotterhck,
sparkling speed demon of the Pin-
neer backfield, received a gaping
cut over the left eye. Five clamps
were needed to close the wound,
Dayl Evans, sturdy 180»pound
tackle, suffer-ed a recurrence of a
shoulder bruise. All three men will
probably be in the starting lineup
against the Panthers, however.

Players Rest Monday ‘

coach watt gave the players a
rest period Monday afternoon, giv»
ing a elialk talk in which weak-
nesses against the Drake forma-
tion were discussed. Afterwards,
light calisthenic exercises were
taken in the gym.

Tuesday afternoon, three new
plays especially designed for the
Teachers' defense were introduced,
one a pass and the others running
plays,

Grinnell has the edge on games
played between the two schools,
the Pioneers having tucked away
seven victories out of 11 contests,
with one game ending in a tie.

staged a steady march down the
field, finally relinquishing the ball
on downs'on the Pioneer 12-yard
line. Grinnell immediately drew a
penalty which placed “the ball on
the one-yard line. A running play
netted a slight gain, and then the
Pioneers again took to the ai
throwing three desperate passes,
before relinquishing the ball to
Drake on the Griiinell 6-yard line,

Gamble in Final Seconds

The Pioneers gambled every»
thing on one successful pass as the
final seconds of play went by. They
finally had to give the ball to
Drake, refusing even to kick out of
the dangerous position in which
they were. Ubl scored a moment
later, on a smash off his own right

line I

tackle. He converted and thc final
score stood 33-21

Drake had previously scored ea!"
ly in the first half after a 71-yard

for the second touchdown,

Schlotterlicck lions 51 Yards

crowd with a “yard return of a
Drake punt in the second quarter,
to score the initial pioneer touch-
‘down Not a Drake inan laid hands
on the speeding runner, as he
swung wide around his own left
end and scored a moment later,

The play 0[ the entire Grinnell
team was inspired during the last
half rally, with Bauer, Schlotter—
lbcck and Bradley standing out in
the backficld, and the entire line
playing brilliantly against the
heavier Drake forward wall.

This was the fourth win for
Drake in the last three years, hav-
ing been last defeated in 1932.
