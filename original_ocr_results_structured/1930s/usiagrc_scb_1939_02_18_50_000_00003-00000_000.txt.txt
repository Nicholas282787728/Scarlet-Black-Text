Teaching Field Gives
- Oppol‘tunity—vlonas;
Civil Service Steady

Three speakcrs participated in
two separate vocations forums
held yesterday on opportunities in
the teaching and governmental
fields

Russell E Jonas, executive sec-
retary of the Town State Board
of Educational Examiners, ad-
dressed a group interested in
teaching, while Robert Paige, as—
sistant director of the Public Ad-
ministration Clearing House in
Chicago, and Thomas Curry, Des
Moines secretary of the Board of
United States Civil service Ex-
aminers, spoke to students inter-
ested in government positions.

Teaching Picture Bright.

Jonas told the teaching forum
that during the depression teach-
ing presented a comparatively
bright picture in the matter of
vocational opportunity.

He pointed out that 100,000
teachers are hired each year in
the United states, 4,000 of these
by the state of Iowa. Moreover,
15 per cent of all students pre»
paring for teaching found JObS
during the depression.

Few Rich Teachers.

"The opportunity for teaching
'advanceincnt is good.” Jonas said,
“but there are, on the other hand,
fcw rich teachers. Some of the
compensation for the job must

be in the sari/ice rendered to saw

ciety and cannot be measured in
dollars and cents."

Jonas advised against
up teaching as a life work unless
the student has four fundamental
aptitiides: interest in teaching.
love of children, leadership ability,
and the liking and capacity for
mental work.
interest in ciiil service,

Speaking before the govern-
ment forum, Paige pointed out
that because of the increasing
closeness in contact between the
branches of government and the
people, the public is becoming
more aware of and interested in
government jobs, which now in-
clude ten per cent of the working
population of the country.

More government spending is
creating more jobs in both num—
ber and variety, Paige said, and
today there is a definite need
for men with graduate work, men
with a high degree of skill and
training for government positions

The present Japanese war is of
vital interest to us all, for it is
a beginning which will breed bige
gar and better wars, Owen D.
Lattiniore stated in his opening
lecture, the first of a series of
eight on international relations,
Tuesday evening,

if Japan wins this war, Latti—
inorc stated, other nations will
be cut off from the evolution of
Ytrade with the Orient which they
have been endeavoi-ing to attain
the last half century. This will
start the iuthless competition for
trade supremacy in China all over
again and will inevitably lead to
war,

Lattimorc also pointed out that
in case of a war of world-wide
proportions it would be practically
impossible for the United states
to remain neutral for any great
length of tune, for our interests
are not neutral, and we would re-
fuse to take a disinterested View.

The real key to the present
plight of the world is the fact
that the dictators know that they
can get away with their territory
grabbing. It all started in 1931
when Japan took Manchuria and
nothing was said about it. Thcn
Mussolini seized Ethiopia. Hitler
followed suit with Austria and
Czechoslovakia 1n the meantime
Japan was expanding still furth-

bounced back and forth among the
countries like a rubber ball. No

stated, we are progressing ueiii-vr
and neai-cr a world war it will
probably take a war to stop this

Lattiniore concluded with the
fact that the feeling and reaction

war and their attitude towards
the United states for its aloof-
