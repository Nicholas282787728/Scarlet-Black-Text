With only two minutes to play,
the Pioneers launched a desperate
aerial attack. The Grinneil passing
game had been sadly ineffective

yard heave from Bauer settled into
the arms of Klepfer who was tackled
from behind before he had taken
more than two or three steps. It was
thc only pass completed during the

“An incident occurred during the
last democratic national convention
which, showed the worth of my libr»
pry,“ Mr. Melgard said. "Just a
few weeks before the convention op.
erred i wrote to Hawaii for some oi
the more local Hawaiian numbers.
While I was playing at the conven—
tion, I received a note from an Ha—
waiian delegate who asked that I play
something appropriate when he as—
cended the platform.

“Among the pieces I had received
from Hawaii was the number ‘kli-Lo’,
a school song not very well known in
this country. When the delegate
ascended the platform I launched the
to this number. The man was so elate
ed that he congratulated me in the
manner of a prize fighter»shaking
his hands over his head. Later he
came up to the organ loft and thank.
ed me for playing the number which
happened to be his school song, He
had expected to hear “Aloha 0c" r
some other more popular Hawaiian
numbers, he said, and was much
surprised at my playing his school
song.

"I am called upon most to play
college songs and popular numbers,"
the organist stated. This he explain.
ed by the fact that they are more
appropriate for sporting events. which
the stadium features, than other types
of music. However, the stadium or—
ganist’s. repertoire must also include
opera and classical numbers along
with the modern pieces, he remarked,
as there is almost no type of musical
selection but what he is called upon
to play at some time or another.

Melgard has been at the Chicago
Stadium for nearly five years. Pre.
