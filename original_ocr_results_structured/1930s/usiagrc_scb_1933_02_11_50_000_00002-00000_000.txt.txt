CREATING INTEREST

' Today many students are expressing the regret
that they missed one of the best entertainment
features on the social calendar this yezll. A lal c
audience enthusiastically rcceiv ed Paul Kochanski 5
excellent violin conceit but the students constituted
a small mino ' of the attendance.

In attemp rig to analyze this lack of interest
by,«, the, stndénts 1'
of selecting these artists was made on the ilswlpr
tion that the students’ interest was not represented
ill the choice of artists for the music course. How-
ever, this ossulnption is found to he erroneous.

A committee of three students confer witll
Prof. Spencer ill selecting lecture course speakers.
This committee is appointed by tlr‘c president of the
Student council, who we are sure constantly
endeavors to give student interest absolutely fair
consideration.

A like privilege is offered the Student council
ill the sclection of lnusic course artists but no
student or group of students feel that they are
equipped to pass judgment as to which a1 sts
would provide the best entertainment. We then
find that we hole a situation which can not be
easily remedied except by one already proposed
method

It has been suggested that less mollcy be spent
for music and lectures and a fund be created for
dramatic presentations, either ill the form of plays
or readings. Readings are most easily within the
purchasing power of the school.

Debates llllcl public speeches have \Villlcd in
popularity with the innovation of newspapers,
radios, and other forms of rapid communication.
At the same time such productions as “‘Of Thee
I Sing” and others are nlost cxtellsifcly appreci-
ated and patronized Our conclusion would then
be that this fund for dramatical productions and
readings should bc crcfltcd before engaging ill fur-
ther expensive contra s tllitt may produce clltcr-
tainment that fails to pl 'lse the student body whose
lllollcy pays for these things.

top floors of exposed halls. and several campus
buildings, including Herrick chapel, the library,
and laboratorics ill Blair lloll were much too cold

Dormitory occupants wcl'c advised to keep
their windows closed during the sub-zero weather
so the pipes would not freeze, hilt even though
this was flonc, a great many reports were received
of radiators which failed to “respond," and of
rooms in which the temperature was too low to
permit studying. Those who attempted to study

It may be that the construction of these builds

CASH VALUE OF DIPLOMAS
(Minnesota Daily)

Another study concerning the cost value of college
degrees has just been completed. This one is the result
of three years work “through practically every profes-
sion and trade in the United States,” by a member of the
Teachers college at Columbia university.

The summary of average annual earnings is as fol-
lows:

Medicine

Law .

Engineering

Architecture

Dentistry . .

College training

Social work

Library work .

Journalism

Skilled trades 1.700

Nursing" 1,570

These figures may not look especially attractive to
the man who expects to distinguish himself in his
chosen field or profession.

But it is another matter for one who is seeking
merely to provide a means of livelihood. A steady annual
income of about $5,000 looks pretty good to the student
in medicine, law, engineering or dentistry whose desire
is a ”trade" to provide economic security. Promise of
an annual income of $3,260 may look pretty good to the
student who, for luck of anything more attractive, would
not object to becoming a school teacher.

Statistics of this nature give the impression that a

rstudenl‘. need only set his heart upon, the income he

wants, and consult a take of average earnings to find
which trade or profession to take up in college to provide
the future he visualizes. He may have doubts, but statiss
tics have a convincing aura about them. They discour~
age questioning.

The fallacy in these figures is in their origin. They
may be of value. but they are worthless to the college
student. They furnish no true indication of what he
may expect. In the words or the statistician, the above
figures “were reached by examining the records of men
who entered a profession and remained in it until they
retired or died!” Thus, only the “cream of the crop,"
only the men successful enough to stick to their fields
were considered.

it is possible, alas. that some of the classmates of
the $5,280 doctors and lawyers were unsuccessful, or
partly successful, or driven to other fields. A true
average of all college graduates might present less rosy-
looking figures of "average annual income"

HOW BEST TO TAM‘E THIS MODERN
FRANKENSTEIN?
_ (lawn state Studmt)

All of us have reflected at some time or another on
the amazing interdependence of the poi-ts of our country,
on the way each of us depends on others for his exists
once. It is interesting, for instance, to imagine the con-
fusion and suffering which would result if the electricity,
water and sewer connections of a city like Chicago or
Des Moines were cut off. And we could easily think of
many other examples of interdependence.

Within the last few days a good example has ap-
peared. Six thousand workers in a plant making bodies
for the Ford Motor company struck as a result of fric-
tion with their employer. Their acLion stopped the supply
of bodies to the Ford company. In consequence, Ford
plants all over the country were shut down, and their
employees thrown out of work. The action of a com~
paratively small group of men had its repercusions
among a much larger number in many communities.

Your reaction to this incident, from the standpoint
of social control, will depend on your own political phi»
losophy. if you are a radical of the right wing, you will
contend that such far-flung enterprises as the Ford
company should be prohibited; and that industrial units
should be so small that disturbanees within them could
have no effect on others. If you are fairly conservative,
you will advocate legislation to prevent sueh tie-ups in
the industrial machine. And if you are a left.wing radr
lcal, a Socialist or a Tecbnocrat, say, you will favor the
direction of production and distribution by a body of
mastereminds who could make everything run smoothly.

But whatever your personal theories, you will agree
that something must be done to prevent disruptions in
the mechanism of supply and distribution. Our society is
so intrieate, and its parts art: so delicately interwoven
that we cannot leave its functioning to chance alone. 1ts
functioning has been left largely to chance in the past,
and we are now suffering for it.

But what to substitute for chance? How best to
tame this Frankenstein of our creation? Those are the
questions facing this generation. They are a challenge
to every one of us.

JOHN GAlswouTHY
(Drexel Triangle)

“Literature is its own reward,” characterized the
person of John Galsworthy. We can see this phase mir-
roreo in his every act and reflected in his work. For.
getting his education, he delved into a world of imagina.
tion and creativeness that is responsible for one of our
greatest English men of letters,

At his demise, this noted author and playwright
leaves us a legacy with a plethora of valuable writings.
“The Forsyte Saga" stands as one of his most outstandr
ing works—comprising three novels, the first of which,
"A. Mari of Property,” is a powerful document about hu
man vicissitudes through which one can see the reflec.
tions of old master5#Turgenev, Du Maupassant, Ana-
tole France and Dickens.

Edward Goodnow, Grinnell Benefactor,
Pioneered in Education for Women

Crave $10,000 for Library

Edward Augustus Goodnow, whose
name is perpetuated on the Grinnell
campus through Goodnow hall, for
which be furnished funds, is rel-nem—
bered in many educational circles as
a generous giver to colleges for 45
years, having been especially interr
ested in education for women.

When Mr. Goodnow began his do-
nations, only two or three colleges in
the country admitted women, but at
the time of his death, in 1905, prac~
tically all institutions of higher edu—
cation were coeducational.

Gave Library

After the tornado of 1882, Mr.
Goodnow gave $10,000 to Grinnell
college, for the erection of a new li-
brary, on condition that the college
establish 12 scholarships for women.
The library, whicll was built, and
named for him, is now used as the
headquarters of the mathematics and
physics departments.

Shortly after this gift, Mr Good»
now gave the college $5,000 for the
erection of Mears cottage, through-
his friendship for Mary Grinnell

Born in liliissaeliusotts

Mr, Goodnow was born at Princes

cendant of a Puritan who settled in
New England in 1632. He was ccllle
eated in the district schools, and had
three years at Hadley academy,

After being connected with a num-
ber of business enterprizes in Mass-
achusetts and New York towns, he
settled in Worcester, Mass, in 1352.
He was in the shoe jobbing business
there for 14 years, amassing a large
fortune.

1n lass, Mr. Goodnow was elected
president of the First National bank

held until 1894, when he retired. He
died in February, 1905, at the age of
94.

The Scarlet and Black of February

factor, and the world of a christian‘
lgentleman. The name of Goodnow

iworks will survive for generations as
a living memorial to him, Sucb men
do not live in vain, and the cause of
education will ever cherish his meme
