Student cooperation is something It the
representatives could not promise, for that must.
remain in the hands of the men and women them-
selves. It is no SCOI‘Ct on the Grinucll campus that
one of the-reasons for changing the chapel hnur
three years ago was the gathering of romantically-
miuded couples daily in Alumni Recitation llnll.

Faculty members have no quarrel with lovers
and those with less serious intentions. They do oh-
jcct, however, to setting aside 20 min tes for
chapel only to hmc it urt izcd in sutll a’ fashion.
Most students, who lealizc the ridiculousness of
such a situation, object, also.

If the chapel hou is not changed, the limin-
taining of the tlcfctc a hreahl’ast system will ho,—
colne increasingly difficult, for it means that the
waiters cannot attend. If it is changed, it will no -
tinue only as long as students vacate Alumni Rc
tation hull during the chapel period.

Donbtlcss there are many studcnts who do not
care to attend chapel. No effort is lllﬂt lo compvl
