meet the state university at Lincoln
Saturday. movnig to Omaha the fol-
lowing Monday to take on the
Creighton university mcl‘men, it will
be the first meat of the year for the

against Nebraska Saturday are dilllr
med by the ineligibility of Clark E17

stroke, breast-stroke, and free style
Bob Adams is lost to the team
thro gh illness, but he may recover

' ’ently to take part in the meet
Saturday. He is confined to a. hospital
bed with an attack of the tin. There
is little chance, however, that Elbert
will be allowed to compete- on the
western trip.

The Pioneer tankers will be led by
Captain John Thomas, dependable
back stroker, who will begin his third

'season as a regular member of the
Grinneli team. other men who will
make the trip are: Roth and Teget,
distance men; Hopkins, Skoug. and
Saurino, free style: Conard, breasts
stroke; Shepharo and Allison, divers,
and possibly one or two other can‘dis
dates,

Creighton recently lost to the Town
State tank team. when the Cyclones
invaded Nebraska. coach Pete Wen-
delrs hopes rest on Abel Mederios,
Hawaiian exponent of the free style,
although his team lacks the balance
of the Grinnell squad.
