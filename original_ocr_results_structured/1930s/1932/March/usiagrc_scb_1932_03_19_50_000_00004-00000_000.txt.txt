“Did you vote?" is the question
with which the Wartburg students
greeted each other last week. In con-
nection with the straw vote being
held in Iowa by the Des Molnes Regs
ister and Tribune, the students de-
cided to cast their votes in favor of
the national and state issues, As it
turned out. Al Smith was the leading
candidate, while Hoover was a close
second. The facility vote showed a
difference, for Hoover received 88
per cent while Smith received only 12
per cent. On the prohibition question,
68 per cent were in favor of the re-
peal and only 20 per cent voted for
maintaining the present law, The
Wartburgers were not in favor of the
cancellation of war debts.

Simpson‘s much mooted dance
question has again been referred to
the student council social relations
committee. Difference in opinion on
the advisability of permitting (lanes
ing has caused several critical situa-
tions on the campus.
