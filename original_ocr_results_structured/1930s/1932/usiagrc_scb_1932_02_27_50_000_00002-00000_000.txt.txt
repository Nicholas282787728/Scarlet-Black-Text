1 am surprised to learn from your
editorial that “students come to col-
lege to learn facts.“ After all, “facts"
are so useless Is it not true that a
balanced mind is or
him of college? By “balanced mind”
I don’t, mean a “teeterrtotter” mind,
or a mind that believes as 1 do, but

LET TRUTH AND ERROR FREELY COMPETE
(From the Des Monies Register)

The Scarlet and Black, Grinnell college paper. obs
jects to elimination oi the Chicago Tribune from the
list of numerous midwestern newspapers kept on tile
in the college library, on the ground that, however
biased and jihgoistic the Chicago Tribune may be in
its news columns and its editorial expressions, students
should nevertheless be given an opportunity to see it
lf they choose.

The Register agrees.

The Register has no idea whether elimination of
the Chicago paper from the college library was to pro-
tect the students against that paper‘s jingoisin and
bias. or whether it was an economy measure, or whether
some wholly other reason was involved. And it wishes
explicitly to disavow any assumption as to what the
idea was.

The Register, furthermore, has no sympathy what-
ever with the Chicago Tribune‘s jingoism.

But it is 100 per cent for allowing the jihgocs to
be heard. It is 100 per cent for giving the jingoes pre-
clsely what it insists upon having granted to those who
oppose the jingoes, and what the jingoes all too often
try to deny themian absolutely unimpeded chance to
present their argumentative wares to the public, includ-
ing even the immature public.

The Register strongly believes in the usefulness
and the inherent safety of letting truth and error com-
bat in the market place, conﬁdent that in that combat
truth will come to prevail. It. is those who secretly
suspect that truth is not on their side who should be
allowed a complete monopoly of the policy of suppres-
sion.

rather a mind that asks, "Why are
the facts as they are? Why do 1 To
act to them as 1 do?” before it
makes judgments.

If you are ever in Chicago, let's
smoke a pipe or two over this ideai
or better still, corner J. P. Ryan and
chew it over with him.
