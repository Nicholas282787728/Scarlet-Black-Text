outside the gar-den wall by a gay
Harlequin, Bess Greer. and his revel-
61's. The Man in the Moon attempted
to woo Gretel. but she spurned him
and went away with Harlequin,

He next saw a spirited Highland
Schottisch by Scotch villagers, and a
Highland fling by a lnssic. Gci ~ude
Lynn, whose two suitors came to
sword points for her hand. She stop-
ped them, however, and the three par-
ticipated in a characteristic Scotch
number.

Gypsies more

The next scene, in a gy sy camp,
was a particularly effective one. The
merry vagabonds had gathered about
the campfire lighted by an old hag.
Marian Mar-r, to watch their queen.
Eleanor Eddy. dance with spirit and
abandon. Roberta. Vancc and Carol
Gawthrop as the bandits gave an
amusing number playing king and
queen with a crown and scepter which
was among some of their loot. As
the fire died down, the gypsies fell
asleep, and only the song of the
queen's lover, Mary Ellen Lund. was
heard.

Discouraged at his adventures thus
far. the Man in the Moon sought his
own kind of people in Fairyland. Lit-
tle fireflies flittetl about among thel
birch trees in the background before
the lights went on to reveal about
the fountain living statues in long
Grecian draperies interpreting such
groups as the Three Graces and Bot-
,cclli's painting of Spring. The
Waves, an interpretive number by
Esther Crook, Frances Rae. Mary
Crook, and Marguerite Konecny, with
Frances Collins as the soloist, was
impressive through skilful handling
of a huge blue scarf.

Go Up in Moon

The balloon and scarf dances which
followed showed grace and variety.
Spriug’s attendants, Mary Crook and
Sidney Himes. heralded her approach
with a rhythmic garland dance. The
Fairy Queen. Phyllis Orris. had grant-
ed Spring three wishes. to go to the
land of the mortals. to know love. and
to attain happiness. The third one was
fulfilled when the Man in the Moon
saw Spring. interpreted by Rosslyn
Hough. and realized that here was
the end of his search.

A large crowd of town and college
representatives were spectators.
