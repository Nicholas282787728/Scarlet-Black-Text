Netsters Meet

Coe Saturday;
Quakers Today

The Grinnell college tennis team,
with only one victory in four meets,
is seeking to better its record this
weekend with dual meets scheduled
for today and Saturday against
Iowa teams. Today, Penn college
brings a four-man team here to meet
the Pioneers, while Friday, Coe col»
lege will provide the opposition for
the Grinnell team at cedar Rapids.
The Penn meet will start at 4 pm.

Frank Davis, captain and No. 1
man, has displayed the best brand of
tennis so far this year, although he
has only won one singles match. Pair»
ing with Bobby White, No. 4 man, in
the doubles matches, his work has
been little short of phenomenal at
times, but on the whole lacks con-
sistency.

Fillmore Gwynne—Vaughan has
been more consistent with his strokes
than any of the Pioneer quartet, but
he lacks the power and drive of
Davis, Don Rowe has shown much
improved form, and at present holds
the No. 3 position. Waite, a sopho—
more, is the only man on the team
to have won two singles matches so
far this year.
