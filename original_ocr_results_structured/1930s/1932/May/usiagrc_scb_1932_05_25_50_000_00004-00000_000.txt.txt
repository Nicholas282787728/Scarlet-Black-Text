With the 1932 intramural baseball
race just about over. two teams re»
main at the top to battle it out for
the championship. Dibble has won
four consecntive games by topheavy
margins, Rawsou’s defeat by a 10 to
1 score being the-lowest total so far.

Gates is in second place, although
she was beaten once by the lowly
Smith hall team, which sprang a sur-
prise to defeat both Gates and Lang
an and finish in a tie for third. Gates
meets Dibble Thursday in the game
to decide the title, all other buildings
having completed their schedule.

Clark beat Smith and Rawson to
share the tie for third, while Langan
won from Rawson and Clark to make
it a three-way affair. Rowsou dropped
all of her games with the exception
of the smith contest, despite the fact
that she held a five run lead over
Gates and a two run lead over Clark
in the final inning of her respective
games with these two teams, only to
lose.
