Darling Talks ‘

to Journalists
at State Meet

Cartoonist Tells Delegates-
They Must Reason,
Nol Dictate

(Spatial (a Ilia smilrl "ml mod») .

DES MOINEsi‘Vi newspaper must
reason with its readers, not dictate
to them," id Jay N. (Dingi Dar»
ling, speaking to tho 150 journalists
who gathered at Younkcrs' tearoom
here from all over the state for the
Founders day dinner of Sigma Delta
Chi, professional journalistic fratel‘ni»
ty, Tuesday night.

Those in attendance included not
only active Iowa journalists, but un-
dergraduate members from the Uni-
versity of Iowa, Grinnell college,
Drake university, and Iowa State cola
legs, The dinner was sponsoi-cd by
the Des Moines alumni chapter of
the fraternity.

Points to Rescinblmicc

Mr, Darling pointed to the rcscnr
blance between the leadership of a
newspaper and the method of leading
people by cartoons. Hc asserted that
the newspaper must go to its readers
and flavor its columns with their
ideas, meanwhile leading them, not by
publishing other material, but by his
jecting other policies into the stories
the readers want to see.

He lauded the progress of the jour—
nalistic profrcssion in the last 30
years, recalling from his own experi-
ence the day when it was a “tramp”
profession. "Even the tabloid has a
place in modern society," he re
marked, "and as long as that is true
it needs leadership. The tabloid needs
Sigma Delta Chi.”

Colbert Speaks

Albert Bates, Chicago, executive
secretary, attended the meeting and
brought greetings from national of~
ficers. Short talks were given by
beads of Iowa journalism schools:
Frank L. Mott from the University of
Iowa: Emory Ruby, Drake universi-
ty; Herschel M. Colbert, Grinnell, and

for the first time Wednesday May
25, both attcrnoon and evening, in
Chicago hall, It will also be exhibit-
ed, as last year, the Saturday and
Sunday of the commencement week-
end, '

Miss Sternfcld said today that she
would like to sec students who in-
tend to register for art courses next
year. Some changes have been madc
in the curriculum and as studio
courses are definitely limited in Size,
particularly the course in elementary
drawing, it is quite important that
students register in thc art depart-
ment before official registration.

Courses Changed

The art survey course is to he re
placed by a one-Semester course to
supplement the course in history of
architecture, which is given the first
semester. It will consist of a historic
al survey of thc decorative arts and
the two courses will satisfy the re-
quirement for history of art for those
majoring in creative art, Both courses
will be given in succccding scmcstcrs
each year,

The lecture course in interior dec-
oration will be given thc first semes—
ter of every year for two hours' cretl~
it instead of one as formerly. The
laboratory course in interior decor. -
tion is also cxtcndcd to a two hour
course to be given next year and in,
alternate years, always in thc sec»,

Dr. Eugene Kuehnemann, Philosopher,
Will Discuss Life of Goethe Friday

Dr Eugene lfuchncmann of the
University of Ereslau, one of Ger-
many's loading writers on philosophy
and biography, will speak Friday cve-
ning at 8 o'clock, in Herrick chapel,
The subject of his lecture will be
“Goethe and the Modern World."

“This should be one of the high
spots of the college year," said R, B.
Mcclenon, professor of mathematics,
today. “It is a rare opportunity to
hear a man of all-round culture dis-
cuss thc greatest genius that Ger—
many has produced. Dr. Kuehncmann
has spent many years in thinking
about Goethe, and will have much of
interest and value to tell us.

”Just as all Germans are glad to
learn more about Washington this
year, so we will do well to become bet
ter acquainted with Goethe. And then,
Goethe most certainly has a vital
message for our day and age, which
I expect will be brought out clearly
in the lecture Friday."

The Grinnell college lecture course
is bringing Professor Kuebnemann
bare in connection with the world
wide observance of (he one hundredth
anniversary of Goethe's death.

Professor Kuehnemann has been a
visiting professor at Harvard and the
University of Wisconsin, and has re-
ceived honorary degrees at both
schools. He has recently had pub-
lished a two volume life of Goethe,
which forms one of the standard
works on the former composer.

Track Dual
on Schedule

Squad of 22 to Make Trip
to Cedar Rapids
Saturday

Coach Lester Duke and Corcaptains
Thomas and Dick Murphy will lead
a squad of 22 Grinnell college track-
mcn to Cedar Rapids Saturday to en-
gagc Coe college in the opening dual
most. of the 1932 outdoor Season.

The Pioneer runners made a strong
Showing in their indoor meets this
year. but showed 2L lack of balance
which indicates uncertainty in all dual
meets in- which they may participate
this year. The addition of Grhflund.
conference champion in the javclin
throw, and the use of Alexander and
Pojmztn in the 220-yard flash should
strengthen the outdoor squad.

,Preih-cts Close Meet

Coach Duke is not Confident of vic-
Lol‘y Saturday, and predicts that the
meet will he very close. On paper,
the Pioneers look Stronger, since
both teams will be hurl. by the lack
of a wellrrounded squad.

Grimell's main Strength will lie in
the middle distance and distance
races. Pllbrow and Ffelffer are fav-
cred to place one»two in both the mile
and two-mile runs, While a strong
showing by Barber or Gerhardt in
either of these race: would give the
Fioneers a slam.

Thomas, Hiirlra compete

Captain Murphy should win thc
half-mile from Vermillion of Coe, who
may also run the mile, while Ger-
hard: should be well up at the finish.
one of the feature races of the day
will be between Captain Thomas of
Grinnell and Hurka of 002 in the
quarter»mile. Hurka beat Thomas in
a triangular meet last year, and' has
turned in some good performances so
far this year.

Coe will be strong in the dashes
with Pulver and Sebern competing.
Pulver ran the century in 10.3 on a
muddy track last Saturday in Cae‘s
annual home meet. Sebern is a Crack
hurdler and may take both hurdle
races.

shotput Week

In the field events, neither team
will be strong in the shotput, leaw
ing this event open for speculation.
The first three places in the shotput
in the Kohawk meet Went to fresh-
men. The discus throw will also he
in doubt, since the Strength of the
Gl'lnnell men is comparatively un»
known.

Smith of C00 Should take first in
the pole Vault with a. mark of 12 feet
already credited to him. He also
tosses the javelin around 160 feet,
