to win the annual spring
game 6 to 0 last Saturday which con-

The contest was played in a col

drizzling rain which made good block- '

difficult. Neither team scored for
three quarters, altho the Reds had a
golden opportunity when Krider fum-
bled a lateral pass to lose the ball on

In the final period ,Duncan intentl—

yards to go to make it first and 10,
but the pass was low, and he was
forced to run. The lanky end evaded
tackler after tackler, and was finally
thrown out of bounds on the 25-yard

By MAX ROSS

Speaking of life's little jokes,—
when Iowa State College's halt-mile
relay team broke the world's indoor
record at the quadrangular meet in
Iowa City, another team finished
ahead of them; Iowa university's
Haw/kayo aggregation broke the tape
first, but was disqualified for passing
the baton out of the lane. Incidental-
ly, when the mishap occurred the
Iowa runners lost about 10 yards.

at Oskalooss hitchrhlked to the Hast-
ings college relays at Hastings, Neb.,
last Saturday with his teammates,
and then tossed the discus 151 feet

to place himself up among the leat‘r‘

ing Olympic contenders.

The Pioneer runners had jokingly
asked Coach Duke to take a squad
out there, but imagine their surprise
when Pittsburg Teachers took all four
relays, every one of them in excellent
time. The milerrelay team hung up
a mark of 3:223, which is among the
three best times turned in thruout the
nation.

Drake relay officials have arrang-
ed a special Inumeter dash to he in»
cluded in the program. This race will
find such stars as Tolan, Toppino,
Class, Metcolfe, McCormick, and
Lutti and Find, Argentine stars.

i. s s

The unofficial track schedule for
the outdoor season is as follows:

April za—coe dual. there,

April 29-307Drake relays.

May 77Creighton dual. here.

May 137Carleton dual, there.

May 217Conference meet at Oma-

ha.

May 29—State meet.

Coach Duke is also planning to en-
ter several men in the National Inter-
collegiate meet which will be held
June 11 in Chicago. No relays will
be run there, but several of the Pio-
neer individual stars will get a chance
if their showing the rest of the sea—
son warrants it.

Claiming that student government
is a waste of time and that “there
are too many kids” at the University
of Colorado, the student body presi»
dent recently quit his job.

Altho the University of Iowa's mile

is confident that the Pioneer aggro
gation will be able to beat the Howls
eyes. On paper, the members of the
scarlet and black team are equally

already holds one victory over the
Hawkeyes, having beaten them in the
quadrangular meet.
