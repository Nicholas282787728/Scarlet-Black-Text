armament is only a small part. AC-
tiv ies include the establishment of
veterans' hospitals, care or widows
and orphans, supervision to prevent

Friday
Harold S. Wilson, instrlictor in
English, spoke in chapel about a new
group of critics which has sprung up
in the last three years, and who are
eiiticizing literature from the stand-
point of proletarianism. “It is their
attitude that literary artists, as well
as other sorts of people, must attempt
to improve our social order," he said.
“This means that they are commend»
ing a new type of literature as yet
comparatively rare. and are attack-
, ing many or the well known writers
of today whose wurk expresses the
individualistic point of view and a
placid approbation of modern so-
ciety."
Mix Wilson traced the development
i and decline of individualism and the
transition into this new proletariat
ism. Althc it is yet too early to
; know just what significance this
movement will have. Mr. Wilson
pointed out that it is not confined to
.a few papers in New York alone, but
that a magazine of proletarian liter—
ature and point of view has even
been established in Iowa recently,
