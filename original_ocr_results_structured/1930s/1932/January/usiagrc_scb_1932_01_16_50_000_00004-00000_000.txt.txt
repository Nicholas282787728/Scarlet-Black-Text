Bulldogs Hiave Held Own
in Valley, Big Six

Conferences

(Special to The Scarlcl and Black)

DES MorNEs—During the football
season just ended the Drake universi-
ty eleven continued to demonstrate
its supremacy in competition with
Missouri Valley and Big six opposir
tion although the year's record shows
six losses against five victories.

In the eleven years that Ossie So-
lem has directed the destinies of thel
White and Blue the Bulldogs have a
percentage of .706 against foes of the
two middlewestern conferences.

The 1931 season saw Drake win
from Iowa state, Grinnell, Creighton,
and Washington, losing only to Mis-
souri. The victory over the Cyclones
gave Solem‘s teams a 6 to o edge in
competition during the period.

Only Missouri has an edge over the
Bulldogs. Washington and Creighton
have failed to win from Drake during
this period. Drake has won 36, lost
15 and tied two games with Valley
and Big Six foes. They have scored
a total of 697 points to 347 for the
opposition.
