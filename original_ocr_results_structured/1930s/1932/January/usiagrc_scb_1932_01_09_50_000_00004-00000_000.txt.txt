Language Survey
of 100 Colleges
Includes Grinnell

Crinnell college is one of 100
American colleges and universities
included in a survey recently made by
Mme. Alice W. De Visme. head of the
French department at New Jersey
College for Women, who, with her
husband, established the first French
House at Middlebury college in 1920.
Mme. de Visme’s survey was for the
purpose of determining how many
American colleges use a system of
language houses in connection with
the teaching of foreign languages.

In questionnaires which were sent
to leading colleges and universities
throughout the country, Mme. de
Visme described the system of lang-
uage houses in use, in which a limited
number of students who study a for-
eign tongue live in a special dormi—
tory where they speak that language
exclusively. With them live native
teachers. who instruct the students
not only in pronunciation and gram—
mar, but in the customs and social
aspects of the country.

The survey shows that while Mid-
dlebury was the first college to es-
tablish a French House, New Jersey
College for Women now has the laIgr
est French House in the country. D’th»
er colleges which have foreign lang-
uage houses are Wheaten, Wellesley
and University of Wisconsin.
