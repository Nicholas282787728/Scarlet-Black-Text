Picnics Affirm
Spring Fever
Among Students

Spring is here! Reports from the
dormitory and quadrangle kitchens
report a, new high on 1932 picnics,
more than to lunches being sentout
Saturday evening, and supposedly
eaten by Grinncll couplcs under
spreading trees (without leavesl and
or slightly damp ground.

According to masculine whispers
ings, picnics are going to be more
popular than cvcr this spring, due to
the well known depression which has
laid a heavy hand on the pocketbooks
of gay and carefree students. It
looks as tho the movies, dances, and
other forms of entertainment are
going to havc a littlc more of Lhe dc-
pr s on on their hands as far as the
college students are concerned this
spring.

However, the students who get free
basket lunches from the college kit-
chens. must remember that they arc
not getting off entirely free of cost.
There is a. certain wear and tear on
blankets unless the couples insist on
getting clear back to Mother Nature.

If some Sunday evening one
snould stray out to the little church
at Westficld, he must not think that
the place of worship is cnjoying a
capacity congregation and every one
of thcm coming in cars. on no: He
will find many of the owners of the
cars which jam the small parking
lot. regarding the moon, quite some
distance from the little church.

of the Young Women's Christian as-
sociation Thursday morning in the
