Score Slams in 4 Events;
Show Superiority

in Long Races

Scoring slams in four events, the
Grinnell college track squad won its
first dual meet of the outdoor season:
from Coo at‘ Cedar Rapids, 74 to 57.‘
last Saturday. The Pioneers showed
a great superiority in the longer:
races, annexing the first three placesl
in the half mile, mile and two»mile
runs.

Lake, Rosc and Crawford finished
one-twosthree in the shotpiit to ac-
count for the other sweep. ‘
Ben Schern of Goo w s the high
point man for the day, nning both
liprdle races and the high jump, and
placing third in the lanyard dash
which Alexander won in :1u.2. Alex-
ander also won the 220—yard event,
and ran on the victorious milerrelay
quartet, which hung up a mark of
3:215 on an extremely poor track
and in a drizzling rain,

In the feature event of the day, the
440—yard dash, Hiirka of Goo scored
a triumph after Thomas of Grinnell
went down in a mixllp with him.
Thomas was leading by a slight mar—
gin when the accident occurred.
Holmes of Grinnell ran a nice race
to finish second to Hurka.

The Pioneers took the distance
races without opposition, Murphy,
Gerhardt and Conard finishing in this
order in the half-mile; Pfeiffer, Pit»
brow, and Barhor leading in the mile,
and Pllbrow, Pfeiffcr and Barber
taking the twosmlle run. The field
events were evenly divided, each
team winning three. Grafiund ac-
counted for a. victory in the javelin
throw, James in the broad ‘jump, and
Lake in the shot.

Columbia university undergradu-
ates have voiced their grievance over
the practice of handing over the
freshman and sophomore classcs to
young instructors with “specialized
interest," The critics insist that an-
derclassmen need the stimulus of
older and experienced teachers more

ists in a single field.
