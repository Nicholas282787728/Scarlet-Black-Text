A RACE FOR ﬁVOLUTloN

There. is a race on ill Europe today. ll i. ll l‘tlﬂ‘
lletwoen the forces of revolution and the forces of
restraint. If the forces of revolution will, ll world
war may he the result.

The forces of revolution are ifiod by the
N87~ ' in German): by the Heilnwehl in Austria. -\t
present the former. at least, appear to he armed
chiefly with steel helmets, from which they draw
one of the names by which they are known. But
they are suspected of having large supplies of arms
hidden.

The forces of restlaint are the gorolmuults ill
powe‘. They must keep ill poncr by letainillg the
polit al favor of a major of the people. By
censmsllip of the press ill Gel m’ll‘ly, and by leftis-
ing the revolutionary groups the l‘qht of holding
uniformed parades. they are prolonb ng their toll-
nl'e with the hope that something will tnrll up ht»
fore revolution becomes inevitable. But tho last
eler‘tion in Germany gave a plurality to one of 1hr
violent parties. the l tlerites, and the halnlloo of
power 5 held by the revolutionary communists. The
present govenlnlent in Germany can only hope that
the revolutionary communists hate the rerolutiolb
ary llitlt‘ritos enough to keep the two from uniting:

What , 1 turn up to prevent revolution” That
is the question about which the (lisarnlzllnmlt con»
forellce is wolulo. llg and ahont which the tloht l ,-
rl'sioll olll‘erentze in June will also wonder, \lzlyhe
redu ion of armament or redl on of tell-if :
reduction of \\’nl' (lclit‘ nill come in time.

But in the meantime the people of central and
eastern linropc will he in revolutionary mood, News
readers will he interestcd to see whether the Sorie.
of revolutions which have occurred since 1776 hrwo
taught statesmen how to avoid llf’ll ctltastl'opht‘s‘.

_GE
EXTINGUISHERS
(From the Daily Northwestem)

Educators will have to cease thinking of themselves
as [irerextinguishers for flaming youth. “Applying the
damper” to the ardent spirits of university students will
never solve the studentradministration problem.

Dill‘mg the last year, countrywide friction between.

students and college administrations seems to have
reached a new high. School authorities have expelled,
suspended, and deprived of privileges, students who
would not stay within the defined boundries.

Expresston by student minds is often ignored or
laughed at, as was the case recently when a faculty
member at the University of Chicago declared that
“Students will vote to abolish anything," and indicated
that the student is not competent to tell upon which
side his bread is buttered. Perhaps there is a modicum
of truth in this viewpoint, but student movements and
unrest will never be solved by this idea of looking down
on student expression

It was the ignoring of student demands which
caused the recent trouble at Columbia Because his
ordinary speech went unheard, Mr. Harris committed the
sin of talking too much and too loudly. He used no tact
and got his results at his own expense.

Cooperative analysis of problems by both student
and administration should be the ideal status. The mem-

bers of the older generation Should use their standards ‘

as contributions of experienceia giii ing factor, rather
than as dogmatic authority.

The student, who on all sides hears himself de-
nounced as mentally stagnant on important problems
which should affect youth, quite often finds himself sup-
pressed when he does choose to raise his head and speak.

Modern university people are hard to handle, Many
student leaders admit that the admi tration has a hard
job facing the difficult student situation. But if a
really sincere attempt were made by both sidesiand
especially the administration—to cooperate in a partner-
ship to discuss student questions, the present jerk and
pull might cease.

As it is, the adult too often thinks of youth as a.
problem in wildness to he tamed and forgets that age
often-dimes offers the problem of tameness to be dis
turbed.

Mr. Clayton said, "i -- failed be.
cause he couldn't. adjust himself to
the situation. He should have been
taught to meet conflicting forces and
keep the middle gr oiiiid and the res
spect of both sides. "

He also stated that the college edi-
tor has a particularly difficult. time
because of the conflict between his
‘own experience and the theory which
he is taught in his journalism courses.

Tuesday

Miss Louisa Sargent, instructor in
botany, described some of her amus-
ing experiences in teaching, when she
had charge of a small country school.

“With time," she said "one learns
to see significance in the insignificant
and to find pleasure in all things." In
the give and take between teachers
and pupils, Miss Sargent believes, lies
the goal of their progress.

Wednesday

The speaker was Frank Almy, ’25,
ldirectol‘ of the Hackley Memorial Art
lgallery at Muskegon. Mich. He spoke
on art.

“Any man who has lived 10 or 20
years and knows that appreciation of
art has a great deal to do with the en-
joyment of life is a potential artist,”
