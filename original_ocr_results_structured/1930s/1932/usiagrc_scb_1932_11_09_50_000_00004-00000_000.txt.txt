der him in true Oriental fashion, this
quiet, dark, likable, studious Japan-
cse boy, Eji Nanri, of Yokohama,
Japan, pleaded for an hour and a half
for a repeal or a modification of the
law passed by an unthinking Depart-
ment of Labor which prohlb't: f
ign students from working while they
attend American schools,

Sometimes he became excited, but
for the most part he gave 'a calm,
forceful presentation of the reasons
why this law which went into effect
this fall, is working a hardship upon
foreign students who really are in-
terested in learning American culture
in our schools and universities,

Dre Alteniatires

“Under this law there are only two
alternatives," he said in his halting,
but perfect English. “We can either
go home or reduce our li ing ex-
penses. We can have no job of any
size, any amount, any kind. We must
pay all our expenses. My difficulty
is this: I didn't get any job here last
semester and had to pay all my cole
lege debts. Now that the rate of ex—
change has fallen I can no longer
afford to pay, nor can I work part
of my expenses out ~under this new
la

The law. which is an amendment to
the Immigration Act of 1924, says
that an alien seeking to enter the
United states as a student must be
able to show that adequate financial
provision has been made, or is satis-
factorily assured, which will enable
him to maintain an uninterrupted
student status because the privilege
of employment even part time, will
not be extended to an alien, admitted
after August 1, 1932.

Only one Affected

Nanri is the only student on the
college campus originally afhected by
the lawr Askel Nielsen of Stonehe-
dinge, Denmark, who is a senior this
year, does not come under the in~
fluence of this law since he entered
this country under the immigration
quota. Bonifacio Aguinaldo, San
Fernado, Union. Phillipine Islands, is
a citizen of this country and there
fore is not affected by the law.

Nanri attended Grinnell last year
and lived in Dibble hall. He worked
on the campus doing odd jobs this
past summer, and had been planning
to live in the Dormitory this year.
He had been promised a half board
job by Shelton L. Beatty Dean of

dorms and working for the college
when he was notified of the new law
on the 11th of September.

He engaged a room and began the
present school year, but his funds
were so low that he gladly accepted
the, r -. free room in the Uncle
Sam's club where he is now living
with Manual Brown, transfer from
Chicago

Exchange Iitioc nulls

"Since I left Japan a year ago, thel
rate of exchange has fallen almost‘
sixty percent, because of the Japan»,
ese embargo on gold which tends toe
keep Japanese money in Japan, and!
also because of threatened warfarei‘
in Manchuria. When I came here one‘
dollar was worth about two yen. Now
a dollar is worth four yen. That:
means that if my father should send
money he must send mice as much
as my bill calls for. This fall the rate,
of exchange has been getting moral
unfavorable, and my father is une‘
able to advance the money to pay my
expenses."

“Almost half the foreign students
depend on jobs at the schools they at-
tend for the paying of their expenses.
This will mean that under the new
law many will have to go back to,
their mother country or cut living
costs. Cutting living costs means go-
ing hungry when one is already doing
without those foods necessary to,
maintain health and energy. This law
is really a starvation law for many
foreign students."

Stop Culture Flow

flow of American culture into foreign
countries, because it is through the
hands of foreign students that your
culture is brought back to other
lands. 1 realize that there is a ques-
tion of whether American culture is
worthwhile. sometimes I think it is
only a revised edition of the culture
of London,” he said with a quaint
smile. “But the presence of Oriental

break down the old barriersof skep-
ticism and misunderstanding that
have existed for too long between the
Orient and the Occidentr To many
the Orient is synonymous with mys-
ticism. This western viewpoint is
charming but untrue. Japan and the
East is not mystical. The really edllr
cated persons know this and have no
prejudices"
