velop interest in public speaking, is

‘Jobs for Seniors Few,
Far Between,’ Wehrhan

"There are few prospects for senior
jobs this year," ‘said Nelson W.
Wehrnsu, director vocational
guidance, today.

of

“Many of the large companies are
cutting down on their personnel dc-
partments in order to carry out a
further program of cconomy, None
of the personnel directors from these
companies are traveling this year."

Mr. Wehrhan believes that the best
Lhing_for the man to do if he is
financially able, is to go after grad-
uation to the city where he wishes
to locate. “There he should call up
on the directors of the personnel de-
partments of the various companies
and should present his credentials. In
time he will get a job."

dents desiring to try out for the ncws

Goethe’s Gift
to Man Today

Dr. Kuehnemann Discusses
German Writer’s Life
in Chapel Talk

Goethe—an cxemplification of the
greatest self-cultivation even seen on
this earthiaccording to Dr. Eugene
Kuehnemann, of the University of
Breslau, was the subject of a lecture
by the German professor in Herrick
chapel Friday evening.

“This year, 1932, is a- year of Wash-
ington to Germany and a year of
Goethe to America," was thc opening
statement. “Let us find in this re-
ﬂection of common interest. a call to
higher duties."

Influenced by Homer

According to Dr. Kuehnemann,
Goethe was born of welleto-do par-
ents at Frankfurt in 1749. As a boy
he was a student at Leipzig, the lite
erary capital of Germany at that
time. "‘Tlie youthful Goethe‘ is an
expression which is endeared to ev—
ery German,” said the speaker.

“The Bible, Shakespeare, and Ho-
mer influenced him most in this
period. After he . left Strassburg.
where he studied law, and returned
to Frankfurt, be was soon to become
the most famous writer in Germany.
He began to write his chief poem,
which was to become his life’s work.

Contains Tragedies

,"Faust contains two of the world's
greatest tragedies: man's tragedy,
that of truth, and woman’s tragedy,
that of love."

In the Leipzig period. according to
Dr. Kuehnemann, Goethc barely es-
caped becoming an artist. He did he
come a scientist, being interested in
geology, light, botany, and anatomy.

"The cvcry day life of man inter
esteol Goethe. In it the broadness and
depth of his understanding are writ-
