AND YOU GET A
o 0 DIFFERENT TASTE

 

 

GET A BETTER TASTE

That’s the reason Chesterﬁeld not only blends
but cross-blends its tobaccos.

Blending mixes tho tollaccos together. Cross
Blending welds them together into one tobacco
of milder, more pleasing taste! And what’s more,
a taste that’s uniform, always the same.

It’s like creating a new and better tobacco for
Cigarettes. It makes Chesterﬁelds milder, gives them
more fragrance . . . and makes them taste better.
