THE ”ODD JOB” LIST

Tlle following quotations are
taken froln a recent letter receiv-
ed by the editor. pertaining to the
unemployment situation in Grin»
ncll.

“The ‘odd job list’ is kept by
the secretary of the dean of men,
and contains the names of those
students who lvollld like to earn
some money washing windows.
raking lcov v, or performing
similar services for residents of
Grinnell.”

"My name is on that list. I
could use some spare time em'llr
ings to a very good advantage.”

“But, ill justice to the unenl-
1)loye(l of the city, it seems to me
that the list should be abolished
until our economic equilibrium
is regained.”

“After all, most of we stnr
dents can go home if we can‘t
make ends meet hole, but the nu»
employed family luau may dc-
pend upon the odd jobs to main-
tain a home.”

'Although we admire the writer
for taking Such a stand. we can
not wholly agree with him.

, If the ”odd job” list were
made up entirely of students who
do not have to have the ' rk, c'
cept as a means of obtaining 0
tin spending money—then we
would be in favor of abolishing
the list.

But, such is not the case. A
good pcrcentagcgif not the ma-
jority of the students who have
applied for jobs, must have them
if they are to ”make ends meet,”
and remain in Grillnell.

The writer says “after all, Stllr
dcllts can go home,” Bllt isn’t
that just what we don’t want
them to do? Now, if ever students
should be aided in every way to
stay in school if it is aa,all possi-
ble. If they are forced to give up
and leave college, chances are
100 to 1 that they never will get

' back to finish tll ' educatioui
and a good education at college
has become a necessity for the
young man or woman who expects
to get a job—let alollc keep it.

REVERE
(The East Texan)

The Classroomrreverie is a vital
part of the education process of all
students everywhere This state of
virtual semi-consciousness comes

with practical workrarday things—
and isn’t. Possibly the class room
reverie should come under two gem
eral heads—the memory reverie and
the reverie that dips into th future
with its possibilities. Under the mem-
ory reverie comes the reliving of past
experiences. In the case of a girl it
may be thought of that new dress‘
worn to a recent dance. It may be a

prolonged mental picture of John in
his tux. To John it is in all probabil-
ity is memory of the way Jane looked,
in the new dress, or how blue her eyes 1
are. These reveries may be a source
of unending annoyance to the teach-
er, but they are precious moments to

those who indulge in them.

The reverie that visualizes the fu—

ture is particularly clear to those

students who are dreamers. No doubt,
Longfellow and Browning sat in their

classrooms while verbs and nouns
were being expounded, wearing the
some vacant and effectual expressions
on their faces that the John and Tom

Browns who are to be the geniuses of
tomorrow Wear today.

There can be ob coldeblooded analy

sis of reverie. It is too completely al
quality of the spirit. It. defies dissec-
tion and direct definition. But per‘l
haps it is analysis enough to give the

sincere plea of the average student. .
“Give me my classroom reverie. It

means more to me than the acquisition

of facts. It means more to me than the ,
knowledge set down in books. It: is

more essentially a part of my educa-

tion process than either of these, be-

cause it is a key to my past and a

sure index to my future. v'

_G‘
IT MIGHT BE HUMOROUS
(Creightouian)
It must be a mark of higher educa-
tion, noticeable particularly upon the:
attaining of a masters degree, to be-
Come sarcastic. It does show a great
amount of education but one wonders
whether it denotes a basic intelligence
or a charitable attitude towards
others.
Instructors in American collegesi
and universities have become noted for
their sarcastic indictments of 'stu-
dents. When lt is directed on one stu-
dent in the class it might afford a
great deal of amusement for the re-
mainder of the class and for the ink
Strllctor but what effect has it upon
the‘ student who “takes it on the
chin?”
Inuumerable occasions arise in the
classroom in which it becomes a sec-
ond nature for the professor tosarcas-
tically correct the error. Authorities
in education found that the practice
was decidedly adverse to modern ten-
dencies in teaching. After all, what
does a person have in mind when he
attends an educational lustit‘utlon?
Surely, it is to learn and understand.
The smartest student in the school
may be ignorant of a certain thing
that is thought to be elementary by
many. When the error is detected in
the classroom it should not be an op-
portunity for the professor and the
students to join in a seemingly humor-

one student.

A \vomau in an eastern City filed a.
suit for damages for being made the
subject of a joke
theater. It is our belief that the stu-
dent who is made the “goat” in Class
has a very good basis for a suit
against the instructor, A very sensi-

offects of being humiliated in class.
It may cause him to keep quiet on
numerous occasions because he has in
mind the classroom episode.

But aside from that it seems to be
gross infringment on fair dealing. In
the classroom the instructor is the
supreme being. The students have to
swallow what he says and have no op-
portunity at a comeback unless they
court the possibility of being dismiss-
ed from tho class for lnsubcrdination.
