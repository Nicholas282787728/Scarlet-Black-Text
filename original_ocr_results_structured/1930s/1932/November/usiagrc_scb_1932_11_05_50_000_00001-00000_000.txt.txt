Vlaried Program

By GRACE HUNTER
(Instructor of English)

In a well»selected program of var-
ied appeal, Sarah lnness MacDonald
and Elsie Haggard Ryan delighted
the Grinnell college audience Friday
night with a recital of music for two
pianos. Ranging from the classic cler-
ity of Bach and Mozart through the
vigorous rhythms of the Sinding
Variations to the brilliance and me-
lodic beauty of the modern group at
the close, the musicians displayed
tenchnical shill so well controlled that
the two pianos sounded like one su—

Clark hall's debaters will meet the
Dibble team in the final of the Mer-
rill debcte series, Monday night at
8 o'clock, in Herrick chapel.

The two teams will argue on the
question, Resolved: That the present
administration should not be returned
to power. Clark hall', upholding the
affirmative, will be represented by
Abe Singer and Ted Klein, and Dib-
ble, taking the negative will have
Clare Heinlein and Mason Meyer.

Night Before Election

George w. Merrill, donor of the
Merrill prize, provided that in election
years the final debate should be held
the night before the Presidential
election.

A committee of five Or seven
judges from the faculty will decide
the winner. The result will rest on
the majority vote of this group.

The series of debates began Oct,
25. when Clark hall met Smith to
argu the desirability of a change in
admi tration. Clark won this den
bate. Rawson hall triumphed over
Langan, the following night. The
first round was completed with the
defeat of Gates by Dibble, Thursday,
of that week. ' ' ’ ‘

The program opened with Si enne

theme, varied and repeated. is woven;
into an exquisite tonal pattern all tool

,ata which followed, the formal struc~‘
ture is embellished in Mozart's char-
acteristic manner with subtle excur-
sions from the principal key and
graceful turns and variations. The
delicacy of this detail. which was
beautifully executed, made a fine con-

Emotion Increases

the program progressed, probably,
mounted to its Climax 'n the last

on the emotions is more direct, To

Already holding victories over

sity of Iowa, the Grinnell cross coun~
try team has only to defeat the
Drake university runners next week
to lay claim to the state champion~
ship.

or secondary schools are asked to
meet Milton Wittler, director of

ant for those who intend to do prac-

tionally satisfying program was fol-
lowed by enthusiastic applause to
which the performers responded with
their only encore, the lovely Le Soir
by Chaminode in which a flowing
melody is borne on a sustained ac~
companlment of quiet beauty.
Temperamenfal Difference

Differences in temperment and
style of playing in the two musicians
enhanced the performance of piano
parts of equal technical difficulty.
Such differences arc largely respon-
sible for the success of Meier and
Pattison who have recently made
popular the recital of music for two
pianos. Facility of “execution, emo-
tional power under admirable con-
trol, and a remarkable degree of co-
operation created an cnsemblc that
amazed and pleased an audience of
Grinncll music lovers.

Huburt Pye, ex '32, was in Grin-
nell Friday attending the funeral of
Mr. Clifford Powell ’13. Mr. Pyc is
a student at the State University.

“Use the existing machinery to get
what you want,” was the theme of
lthe whole talk. In a compliment to
the State department, Mr. Harris said
that either Mr. Stimson or Mr. Gil-
bert were competent men who must
be kept on the European job. He also
stressed that the United States must
be represented at the coming inter-
naional conference by a man of arm
bassadorial rank, and not merely by
a consul, as so often happens at Ge-
neva.
Practical, renccful

Practical as well as peace-loving.
.Mr. Harris asserted that young vo-
ters, or any voters, could influence
the policies of Congress by visiting
their congressmen personally with
well formulated demands. He was
confident that the government, in—
cluding the state department. would
respond to organized, intelligent re
quests from its citizens.

Finally, he urged that after the
election, and in the next session of
Congress a number of undersirable
and desirable bills will be offered, and
that as voters, the citizens must be
:informed about these bills. and see
that legislation is carried out as they
wish it.
