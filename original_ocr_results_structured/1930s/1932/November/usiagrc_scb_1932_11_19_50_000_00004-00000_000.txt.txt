Illinois Professor Condemns
‘Childish Disciplinary Acts’

CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (CNS) — Haz-
ing, paddling and other so—oalled
childish disciplinary actions employ-
ed by fraternities to hold their pledg-
Harry Woodnurn Chase of the Uni-
versity of Illinois.

Declaring himselt in favor of "con!
structive drsciplin President Ch -
maintains that there is a sharp dis-
tinction between that and hazing.
Paddling, he declared, is an outworn.
barbaric and indelen-sihle custom, de-
hasing both the man who administers
it and the pledge who suffers the
actual nlows.

“If a prison can maintain discipline
without such force. it is a poor trib-
ute to,traternities if they cannot do
a: much," he Said.

Van Patten, Joe Manderreld, and
Robert Whyte drove to Galdﬁeld
