from now, college youth will see that
it does.

“EDUCATION BEYOND
INTELLIGENCE . ' ‘
(The Creightonimi)

A few months ago a recent grad-
uate of one of America’s universities
wrote in Forum to this effect:

"We spent sixteen, or if we wished
to have more initials after our names,
seventeen, eighteen or twenty years
in schoolrooms. Not being educated,
but being trained. Not being taught
to think but being trained to remem-
her.

“It would have been infinitely bet—
ter for many of us if we had used
half those years getting experience
and wages in some trade instead of
being social parasites."

The person who wrote those part1»
graphs was more right than he proh-
ably suspected. However, it must he
borne in mind that he was writing
,about his own personal findings and
'the ﬁelings of others like himself.

WORTH WHILE

Following Thursday‘s Thanks;
giving vacation. most of us rc-
lurned to school yesterday, ill
preference to the triple cuts which
would have been counted against
us, had we extended ollr holiday
another day.

\Vc are still wondering whether
or not it would have been better
for the powers that be to have so
arranged the college calendar that
Grinuell students might have had
vacation yesterday its Well.

Ill one of'our classes, the profess
sol‘, sensing that his pupils were
not over anxious to recite, asked

for a show of hands on the qucs-‘

tioll: “How llll‘tl‘ly have read the
lesson assigned?” Less than a
quarter of the students present
responded.

We venture to soy
situations were not uncommon
yesterday morning, in fact, we
feel safe in saying they were pre-
valent.

Frankly, we can’t see how the
instructors could expect any more
than meager preparation for
their classcsidnd, we don’t be-
lievo they (lid.

There were several reasons why
it would have been difficult to 111'
low the extra day’s vacation this
yefll'#2tlllollg them, the fact that
the college yeill‘ must contain it
certain nllmlmr of days of school.
and since Grimlell still-ted late
this year, for economic reasons,
the day could not be spared.

Thanksgiving this year is post.

, But it will come again next year
and there is almost certain to lie
the same amount of wrangling
over that alleimpol'tilut extra day
funlcss the college authorities so
arrange the schedule for 19337
1934 that it (Friday) can be ill-
cludcfl in the Thanksgiving recess.

In our opinion. it should be so
al'mngcdrif at zlll possible,
oncsdny vacation is almost worse
than none at all, since it does not
allow time for studcllts living any
distance from tllc campus, to go
home, and yet is , lst long enough
to cause a let-flown from study

which is not recovered from until
after Friday classc

CHALLENGING DEFEAT.
(Daily Trojan)

Is the college youth of America
"taking it" (meaning present econ—
omic and‘ social conditions) on the
chin with no comeback and little
spunk? Is it leaning back in its easy
chair and passively surveying. the

situation, or perhaps ignoring it al-'

ly, Harvard, ’33, and proceeds to
prove his point in no uncertain lang<
uage. His dynamic arguments are
found in November's New Outlook, Al
Smith's recent publication, under the
title, “Coming of Age in America."
Mr, Lindly asserts we are challeng-

ing defeat, not with vague optimism:

but a compound of hope and courage
and training. We will be honest in
our business dealings, not from an
innate sense of morality, but common
sense reasoning that thereby we will
get farther ahead. We will go into
politics with a. bang. It is too late to
do anything about the last election.
but the political campaign of 1936
will he a different story. In the can—
test just concluded, none of the candi—

He was not writing of the great
,majority of students who go to school
for the satisfaction that an education
may bring. Nor was he writing of the
,numbers of students who go to school
to become cultured and thereby make
Ithe world a better place in which to

live.

The writer of that article has found
himself in the position which some
one once described as “educated be~
yond intelligencc.",1t is always a sad
and at the same time a dangerous
thing when peoplei know of things
which they cannot understand. When
education is crammed into those who
do not have the intelligence to under.
stand, it becomes an injustice to
;those so exposed and a danger to
others who might come into contact
with those “educated beyond intelli-
gollcc."

‘ Every person has a certain degree
of native intelligence which can be
developed to a certain extent by edu—
cation but education cannot create in—
telligence in any person. Education
is purely information to a large ex.
tent. some of it is intended to direct
intelligence along straight lines; to
arrive at correct conclusions.

Too many students are in Amer-
ican universities who do not have the
intelligence to grasp what is being
taughtithe meaning behind what
they are studying. Entirely too many
are in school with the idea that it
will enable them to earn a great sum
of money. To those we might say that
they would earn as much if they had
never seen a university. Then, too,
they would have saved the cost of
an education. Like the writer in For.
um stated, "it would have been in—
finitely better for many of us if we
had used half those years getting ex-
perience and wages in some trade."
And he was right. ,

THE NEW YALE PLAN.
(University nnily Kansnn)
l Temporarily, at least, the day of
the pcnniless student who earns his
way through college is past, Dr.
James Rowland Angeli, president of
Yale university, believes. In consist-
ency with this belief, a. requirement
has been made at Yale that all fresh
_men, after their tuition has been paid,
must have in addition a sufficient
‘lamouut. of money to take care of
their necessities for the school year.

This step at Yale appears to he an
[indicator of a trend which many ins
[stitutinns of higher learning are be—
[ginning to take. With education be-
coming more and more a necessity in
society, and with the economic status
of the world in its present serious
condition, such an announcement
comes as a severe blow to young peo—
ple [not fortunate enough to have
much money.

Probably the main reason which
would be given for the adoption of
runs new rule is the overcrowded
condition of colleges and universities.
The student’s can not be handled
lproperly with the present facilities,
‘it is said. But is the move made by
Yale in the right direction to adjust
the situation properly?

Another plan is proposed, that of
making the scholastic requirements
for entrance higher, so that only
those who have the ability to learn
may he admittcd. In addition, scholasn
tic attainments would be made more
difficult to gain.

In accordance with the beliefs which
we of the western world hold about
equally of man, the educators’ plan
is the more desirable.

0N LOVE.

(Corurdlinn)

“Romance—ah, Romance!” A long
sigh gurgles off into an exclamation
point and takes up afresh, “Love, thou
gentle elixir!” Another long breaths
ing spell as the victim recuperates
from his second seizure.
It. must be admitted that these are
nights white with moonlight when
proximity performs a distinct service
in keeping the participants warm.
What poetry to watch our various
campus sweethearts these treasured
nights, as they spill honey across the
campus, and nauseate all observers
with the saccharine atmosphere they
leave behind!

Devotion they call it; it approaches
idolatry. Love they call it, but some-
how we always think of puppies
when they bring up the word.

Editor, Scarlet and Black,
Grinnell, Iowa.

Dear Sir:

For some time there has been lurks
ing in my mind the idea that chapel
programs would attract more atten-
tive and interested audiences, if the
programs were announced before»
hand in the Scarlet and Black, Recent
editorials appearing in your news-
paper have brought this matter again
to my attention,

It seems to be the policy of the
chapel committee to keep their pro-
grams a deep, dark secret until the
very moment chapel begins. Perhaps
in many cases this is a good idea, for
if students were informed of the sub
stance of many chapel periods, they
would attend them in fewer numbers
than they do at present.

In my mind this would create a bet»
ter atmosphere than now exists, for
chapel speakers and musicians would
he forced to “deliver the goods." If
certain persons could not give the
student something worthwhile, those
persons would soon find out from
chapel attendance just what students
thought of them. Those persons
should then be removed from the list
of eligible chapel speakers and per-
formers.

It seems to me that this would re»
move the “deadwood” from chapel
programs, and would place chapel out
in the open, where intelligent stu-
dents might decide for themselves
whether or not they would be bene-
fitted either mentally or spiritually
from attending

Sincerely,
A Grad.

“Am you in favor of an advance
announcement of the drapel pro-
grams?"

Alfred chld: A good idea except
for pussible discrimination by Stu»
dents and subsequent 10W attendance
at chapel.

William VDSS: It, would be Exceed-
ingly convenient for Chapel goers to
know in advance the speaker and
subject, because everyone has their
preferences as to whom and what
they would like to hear.

Gene Groin-ids: No. _The advance
announcement of chapel speakers
would prove unsatisfactory, for it
would result in a. varied attendance
reflecting directly upon the capacity
and reputation of the speaker and
might possibly give birth to a new
type of handshaking.

Donald Ross: YES. I believe that
announced chapel programs would en-
courage those students who do not
attend chapel to do so on the days
when their favorite professors were
to speak.

Snap Juries: I firmly believe that
chapel programs should be announo
ed in advance. Many interesting talks
are missed, simply because no special
arrangement has been made wherby
students may select. their days for at
tondance.

Richard Rossmml: NO. If chapel
programs were announced in advance,
I believe attendance at chapel would
tcnrl to be based on the individual’s
particular like or dislike for the
speaker. The importance of the serv-
ic‘e Should be the inspiration received,
without particular emphasis on the
speaker. For this reason I do not. fa-
vor an advance announcement of
chapel programs.

Robert. Palllcliek: Announcement of
chapel programs would increase the
attendance at chapel service, for
there are certain students who Wish

 

to hear certain programs but do not
like to attend chapel every day in
order to hear these programs.
Edsou A‘ttlcson: Each strident has
a preference for particular professors
whom he wishes to hear in chapel.
Some professors have a larger follow
ing than others. Keeping quiet about
chapel speakers esems to be an ef-
fort to remove the stigma from those
protossors speaking in chapel who
are not interesting enough to attract
an audience. rerhaps publishing the
program of speakers for the week
would force chapel talkers to deliver
the goods.

George Vim Nostrhndr Of course
we want to know what movle is on
at the theatre before we pay our «to
cents admission change; but is it for
the same purpose that we attend
chapel? Publishing the chapel pro-
gram in advance would not only be
unfair to the speaker, but would also
tend to offset the real purpose of our
chapel period.

William unchman: Since all of us
are interested in various subjects and
there is no doubt that certain other
subjects are very boring to us, I
think that if the chapel programs
were announced in advance we would
have much more attentive and more
interested audiences.
