Drama Revival

By A STAFF \‘VRI‘I‘ER

Apeing the old time actor’s emoc
tional abandon, yet giving a histrion—
ic interpretation that anything but
bored the modern audience, Grinnell
chapter of National collegiate Plays
ers presented a revival of the last
century melodrama, “Ten Nights in
a Bar-room" that brought back happy
memories to the minds of the older
members of the audience and gave
the younger an interesting and
truthful insight into the way of the
drama of fifty years ago.

Under the capable direction of Mrs.
Sara Sherman Pryor, director of
drama, not only was the acting in
keeping with the play. but the scen-
ery made the older persons in the
audience forget they were in the
twentieth century, carrying them
back to the “opera house" of their
childhood.

Birdsnll Versatile

of the drunkard who later reforms,
ran the entire gauntlet of human
emotions from pathos, love, hate, to
a realistic portrayal of drunkenness
and delirium tremens and finally to
a sober, respected citizen. Mr. Bird-
sau should have added praise, be-
cause hc left a hospital bed on the
day of the show, after spending three
days there. '

In comparing the cast of Thurs-
day's performance with professional
casts that have given the play re-
cently, perhaps the only noticeable
difference would be that the pro-
fessional groups played with some—
what more ease and spontoniety, but
that ability comes only after longer
experience than any of the local
group have had.

As a tribute to the actors. the aud-
ience, iu the old time manner, biased
the villains and applauded the heroes
and heroines. Walter Straley, by his
excellent portrayal of the villainous
gambler, drew the biggest share of
the disapprobation. although Irwin
Oxley, as the hard-hearted innkeeper,
and William Pryor, as his worthless
son, came in for their share.

Comedians Really Humorous

Donald Ross, the principal comedv‘
ian, never failed to draw laughs from
the audience when he was on the
stage. Robert M. Brown, the “young
man about town", combined with Mr.
Ross to add to the humor in some
scenes, although their portrayal of
drunkenness in one scene detracted

Steiner Depicts
Horrors of War
in Chapel Talk

“Man will never be destroyed by
any external force," said Dr. Edward
A, Steiner, professor of applied Chris-
tianity, in his Armistice day address,
in Herrick chapel, yesterday morning
at 10 o'clock.

“Man has survived beasts far better
suited than himself to the rigors ot
nature, because of his reason, but he
looses reason in warfare and then
sinks below the beasts."

“He lacks two faculties essential to
save himself from himselfﬁmemory
and imagination. These two qualities
were the peculiar property of the
Jewish race.”

Doctor Steiner spoke of the horrors
of war, the hysterical relief of the
first armistice, the disgusting ccrrup.
thn and the vengeful gratitude of
postwar governments. but declared
his faith in the ultimate victory of
the peace movement

"I am a realistic optimist.”~he said,
“and I believe that man, was not cre-
ated to become a beast and destroy
himself.”

Music was furnished by the Grin-
nell college vesper choir.

After fighting nip and tuck all the
way, and leading. 6 to s, with live
minutes to play, the Pioneers were
unable to stop a final concerted
Creighton attack and lost to the Blue~
Jays, 9 to G, in Grinnell's homecoming
tilt on Ward field, yesterday after—
noon.

All scoring was done in the last
half. Grinnell’s points came by way
of a touchdown, resulting from Snap
James' spot pass over the goal line
to Duncan, late in the fourth period,
while Creighton tallied her points
through Collins kick from placement
in the third, and O'Leary’s sensation—
al snag of Collins long pass into the
end zone, in the last moments of the
fourth quarter.

Makes Spectacular nun

Dick Ullrich, Pioneer quarterback,
made the most spectacular play of
the day, when he received Collin‘s
last kickoff on his own lorya‘rd line
and ran it back 65 yards, to the
Creighton 25-yard line, before being
brought down.

Ullrich also made the longest kick
of the day. Punting with the wind,
in the first period, he once booted the
ball so yards.

Despite the fact that the thermom-
eter hovered around zero all after—
noon, both teams played heads up
football all the way. Ullrich, James,
and Graflund, were outstanding for
Grinnell, and Colin, Gordon, and
Jelen showed best for Creighton.

Rose kicked off to Creighton 25-
yard line. Bluejays returned to
Creighton 37, Grinnell recovered

The play was recalled and Grin-
nell penalized 15 yards for roughing
the kicker. First and ten, Creighton
on Grinnell 42 yard line. Collin lost a
yard at center and a pass by Gordon
was knocked down by Gratlund. Gor»
don picked up 5 at left tackle and
Collin kicked to Ullrich who returned
to Grinnell 14.

Ullrich made 5 at right tackle and
James added 3 through right guard.
Ullrich got a long punt with the wind
which was grounded by Grinnell on
Creightonls 6 yard line (30 yards).
On a fake punt, Collin slipped around
lcft end for 19 yards and first down
on Creighton 25 yard line. Jelen fail-
ed at center. Gordon picked up a
yard at center. Gordon made three
at right guard. Ullrich carried it 15
to 50 yard line on Collin punt. James
picked up 10 for first and ten through
the right side. Clark's 10 yard pass
to Graflund was dropped. Ullrich
went through right guard for 4, and

complete. Grinnell drew a 5 yard
penalty for two incomplete passes.
