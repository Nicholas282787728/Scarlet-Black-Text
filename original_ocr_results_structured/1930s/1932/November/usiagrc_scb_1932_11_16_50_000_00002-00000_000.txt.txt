MONDAY NIGHT HOUSE
MEETINGS

Grillnell college lncn have an
opportunity to secure perfect
functioning of their dormitory
government witll the advent of
the regular Monday night busi-
ness- plan as recently adopted by
the Council of House Presidents.

Essentially, the underlying mo-
tive for this innovation was to
make it possible for all men to
know exactly what is gomg on
relative to building government
and to allow them to aid ill form-
ulating the building policy which
in turn wil make the government
run smoother all the way through.

Another motive of importance
for this new plan was that it is
intended that all town associates
should attend these regular niectr
ings. This should further aid in
building up the feeling of cordial-
ity between the town men and
dormites. Only whole-hearted co
operation can make thi. plan for
regular business meetings a suc—
cess.

Quite natu 1115’, a good deal of
the responsibility for the success
of this plan rests with tllc llldlvldr
nal house presidents who must
plan these meetings. th, without
the attendance and co-opcrotion
of every man, these meetings can
not be a success. So far tlle atr
tendance has not been up to ox—
pcctations, which means that the
mcll have ,not entered whole»
heartedly into this plan.

There has been some discussion
among some men that there is not
enough business to warrant thcsc
weekly meetings. This opinion has
been voiced only by men who
either have not attended the meet-
ings or have done so only one sv
ionally. Only by attending these
house meetings call these men
find out what there is to be done.
The halls are governed by the
men and hence all Grinnellian i
intending to become public Spil t-
ed American citizens—should cu-
ter into their own government.

In conclusion, the Council of
House Presidents wishes to urge
every man to save each Monday
night between 7:15 17.11], and 7:45
p.m. for the regular weekly busi—
ncss meeting, Your co-opcration
is asked. ED.

WHAT, N0 HEAT?

Men in the dormitori s Tues-
day morning crawled out of bed,
closcd their windows, and scurrr
led out into tho comparative
warmth of the halls to drc ‘,

It appears that as an economy
measure the heat is shut off for
scvcral hours during the night
and early morning. Those who
study .te have found efforts to
extract heat from their ldiotol's
after 11 o‘clock fruitlcs

The situation would not hc so
bad if the rooms would hcat up
quickly ill the morning, but at
noon Tuesday some rooms with a
northern exposure registered only
50 degrees, 24 above freezing.

To study in such a room is, of
course, impractical and if the
room sol-o allowed to gct and stay
that cold with ally frequency it is
l oly that many hospital cascs
will rcsult.

J‘WHO ‘8 AT CHAPEL?”

“Who is talking at uhdpol this
morning?” A frequent question
heard among students on tho
Grilulcll college campus, and nus
fortunately a question which can
be answered only AFTER lhc
service is over.

To our point of View the stu-
dent has a right to know who is
to speak at ehnpol, and govern his
attendance or llon-nttcndmlcc ac
cordillgly. Many students do not
go for that very reason. Often
they are sorry after hearing the
name of the speaker or (he sull-
ject, but at times they are rather
glad they did not attcnd.

The Scarlet and Black has l'o-
pcatcdly attempted to get the ad-
vance news of tllc week’s chapel
program in ordcr to furnish the
students with that much desired
information, but has alwnys been
met with the statt‘lucnt, “\Ve do
not give out the chapel program
in advance."

‘It is Very plnin to see that those
in authority are afraid of the dif-
fcrcncc in chapel attendance from
day to day that such announce
mollts might cause, but is it fair
to the student and to the good
speaker? Vesper service programs
are announced in advance. Why
not put the chapel programs on
the some basis'.l

morningi”

WINGS
(The Midland)

Zone. Gale, a well known modern
writer, has stated that she does not
fear being bored with the life of a
small town because her soul has
Wings with which she can ﬂy to the
heights where She wishes to be. This
philosophy might be adopted by stu-
dents in small colleges such as Mid-
land.

Small church schools are not al-
ways as well equipped us are the
large universitles. and colleges with
large endowments. Perhaps the cal-m
pus and the buildings are not as fine
as in the bigger schools. The activi—
ties are not as elaborate and the or-
gnnizations do not boast Greek letter
names. 011 the other hand there are
greater opportunities for student fel-
lowship. In a large university the
members of the faculty are some—
times considered as a group of peo-
ple whose mission in life iS to lec-
ture and give out gradrs at the end
of the year. In the smaller college
the teacher is a. person who is really
interested in the affairs of the stur
dents.

In the smaller college the students
have an opportunity to use their
wings. As Zena Gale has said, any
one can take himself out of the every»
day life to the heights he desires. One
of the main reasons for coming to
college is t_o learn to live more wisely.
Since there is more time for thought
~time to use one‘s wings—in a small
college than in a large, ever-busy
school, students can carry themselves
above the trivial inconveniences to
chosen goals by using their wings of
imagination, idealism and purpose.

STRICTLY MASCULINE
(The Indim Daily Student)

With an attitude strangely mid-
Victorian, Johns Hopkins university
has ruled that no woman will be al-
lowed to take part in any major
campus ucti ty in the future. The
undergraduate council passed the
motion as a result of objections from
students, alumni and activity heads
after a woman student had blzen
chosen editor-in-chief of the campus
magazine.

Although the newly chosen editor
was allowed to retain her position,
the masculine contingency of the
School saw to it that their privileges
would be protected hereafter. The
theory seems to be that Johns Hop-
kins is a man's school—with some
women attendingiand it is to be
kept a man's school.

This policy seems unfair in the
sense that all duly enrolled students
are members of the student body, en-
titled to compete for any honors
there may be. More than one school
that is theoretically eta-educational
has this policy more or loss in the
background governing its actions.
Michigan has for years borne the
reputation of a. school discriminating
against its women students, and only
recently has extended them many of
the privileges women in other co-
educational schools enjoy.

Unfortunately, it is common enough
to find race discrimination in our colr
logos and universities, but it is uur
usual to fun a modern school adopt»
ng this antebellum attitude of “wom»
en~cun't-do»that." The mildest thing
that can be said of the Johns Hops
kins move is that it is old»fashioned
and incidentally more than a little
ridiculous.

RADIO RAMBLINGS

An interesting new program series,
entitled “America’s Grub street
Speaks," which recently started over
the WABCrColumbia network, will
warm the cockles of bookworms'
hearts.

During these programs, heard on
Sundays, from s to 6:15 p. m., east-
ern standard time, Thomas L. Stix,
former president of the Book League
of America, brings literary celebri-
ties to the microphone for informal
chats. Mystery story writers, hum-
orists, and deep thinkers will be
among those interviewed.

The first of the “Grub Street" ins
habitants interviewed was the mod-
um novelist, Katherine Brush. The
second, to be heard Sunday, will be:
John Held, Jr., writer artist and,
dreamer of the mauve decade. Pas-t
sibly Stlx will wring from him theé
reason he has deserted the fluffs and:
flounces of the modcrn flapper in his
popular woodcuts to depict the gay
blades and buxom maids of the olden
days of beer and bustles.

New York U. Professor
Defends Using Preposition

NEW YORK (CNSl—Duspito all
the textbooks on English to the con-
trary, “a. preposition is sometimes at
good thing to end a. sentence with,"
according to Dr. WalteT Barnes, plo-
fessor of the teaching of English at
New York university.

Professor Barnes accused “gctund~

grinders" and "grammar racketeers"

of manufacturing empty, theoretical
distinctions, while ignoring urgent
problems of colloquial speech.
"Prepositions often fall naturally
at the end of sentences, and users of
effective colloquial language have no
respect for the rule against such
usage,” he declared.

He made a plea for greater recog-
nition of the necessity and value of
colloquial speech.
