tire from the presidency toward the

‘Economic Illiteracy’ Cause
of Continued Depression

TORONTO, Can, (CNS)7"We
could end the depression overnight,
if it were not for the economic illit-
eracy of the people who control the
political machine."

This indictment of those in con-
trol of the social system was voiced
recently by Prof. Irving Fisher, Yale
university economist. He was a guest
speaker at the University of Toronto.

“The one thing most needed in the
world is a certain amount of inila—
lion,” he declared. "The last cam-
paign (in the United states) lost a
great chance for educating the pea-
pic on this subject, but the politicians
were afraid of being misunderstood
by a public which cannot see any-
thing hut black and white."

TEE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Prof. Elias Blum

Attributes American Trend
to Rapid, Easy World

Communication

“We are becoming too cosmopoli—
tan to develop a distinctly American
music,” said Elias Blum, professor of
the Theory of Music, in an informal
interview with a Scarlet and Black
reporter yesterday Rapid and easy
communication with all parts of the
world were attributed by Professor
Elum as responsible for the cosmo-
politan trend in music.

“We know more of Russian music
than do the Russians themselves be-
cause of our ability to contact
through travel all phases and de-
grees of Russian music.” added Pro—
fessor Blum.

Cites Gospel Hymns

He cited gospel hymns that have
lived 50 or so years as music typical
of American life then. “Some of these
hymns had themes beautiful enough
to survive all these years and so may
be the fate of some of our modern
compositions but i decline to make
any definite prophecy," he said.

Commenting upon George Gersh»
win's “Rhapsody in Blue" as a posse
ible basis for the development of an
American music, he stated, “1 have
heard the selection but a few times
and have not carefully studied it but.
I believe, it is a hodge-podge of high
and low brow testes that baffles most
of its listeners,"

Paul Whiteman, American jazz or~
chestra leader, in a statement recent
ly quoted in The Des Moines Regis»
ter cited “Rhapsody in Blue" as an
example of what American compos»
ers could do in creating a distinctly
American music.

Deals Opera Blow

A blow was dealt the supporters of
American opera by Professor Blum
when he sai , "Opera is too diffused.

Blues Rapsody Music Hodge-Podge

Calls Gershwin’s

|
lTlle acting, colorful costumes, and'
Esccncry dominate the mllSlc. Couser
qllcntly, opera stars appearing on
concert stages are often a great dis-
appointment to the audience."

“Thus far the American public has
paid dearly to hear celebrated opera
stars. Opera has been considered a
luxury to be enjoyed only by the
‘very rich. This tends to limit the
number of operas produced each year
and confines the writing of operas
to only a few wealth endowed com-
posers."

’ said Blum, “would not attempt
to spend two or three years of my
life writing an opcra with no hope
that I may Win a five thousand dollar
prize. The chances of winning the
prize are slim and the opera would
likely be produced only once as is
the case in America today. This is
one reason why we have so little
truly representative American music
in opera,

Compliments Progress

A compliment to America’s pro-
gress in music is that it has more
orchestras (Symphonic) than any
other country excepting Germany
where there is government Subsidy
of music institutions.

In answer to the query, “Do radios
tend to educate the American aud~
ience musically?” he replied, “Radio
has slightly educated the American
audience in fine music but in doing
‘50 ii. has killed off the best musicians
and possibilities for creating genius
ES."

The radio has failed to educate
where the individual has it running
all day long catching everything on
the air," he added.

According to Professor Blum. tyne
copationl is not a development of just
the modern dance orchestras. There
was present in the Seventeenth Cen-
tury a much more intricate Syncopa~
ﬁlm than we find today.

The true distinction in American
jazz is the exaggerated rhythm and
that has greatly melted down from

 

 

what it was five or six years ago.

In closing Professor Blum stated
that when he finished school be for-
sook the idea of cntcring a conservur
tor-y disregarding the ridicule of
friends and entered college music in-
struction. Today many of whose who
went into conservatories are walking
the streets out of work,

To make tobaccos mild and mellow for Chesterﬁeld ciga-
rettes, just about four miles of warehouses are ﬁlled with
mild, ripe Domestic leaf, stored away to age for two years.

The greater part of 90 million dollars is invested in
these tobaceos. Is it surprising that Chesterﬁelds are.

milder?

That they taste better?

Everything known to Science is used to make Chester-
