Injured Knee May Keep

James on Bench

S aturday

Flashing an unexpected strength in
the Michigan State contest, the Grin»
nell college eleven will get a partial
breathing spell this weekend, when
it tackles Coe college at Cedar Rap-
ids Saturday afternoon.

Tlre Kohawk grid machine will by
no means be easy, however, as they
are a much improved club over last
year with a, brilliant running attack,
Last year the Pioneers opened the
season with Coe. winning 26-0.

Coaches satisfied

Coaches Watt and Duke were
thoroughly satisfied with the Crinnell
showing against Michigan State, for
the Pioneer team gave the Spartans
a much stiffer battle than they had
expected, and even demonstrated
their superiority in certain depart-
ments by piling up more first downs
than their rivals.

Clarence (Snap) James is suffer—
ing from a badly injured knee, and
may not play in his home town Sat-
urday, since Coach Watt intends to be
sure he is well before he enters action
again.

Dick Ullrich is continuing his ex-
cellent work, and by now has stamp»
ed himself as one of the best quarter-
backs in the Missouri Valley confer—
ence. Wesley Clark proved that his
good work against Cornell was not a
flash in the pan by completing most
of the 11 out of 13 passes which the
Pioneers made good Saturday.
Gould, McMilliu Outstanding Linemeu

Captain Craflund and Al Rose did
splendid work in backing up the line,
while Craflund accounted for several
nice gains through the line.

In the line, "Pine" Gould and Bob

there have been no really outstanding
men in the forward wall.

One of the most surprising devel-
opments is the continued improve-
ment shown by Clarence Smelser, 190.
yound guard, who bids fair to push
one of the regulars out of the start—
ing lineup before long. and has al—
ready seen some action.

Tuesday Coach Watt sent the regu—
lars against the freshmen, and they
had little trouble in gaining ground.
Monday the second-stringers scrim-
maged the freshmen and Alexander
and Singer ran rampant through the
fresh line.

Ullrich and Clark took turns at
punting to freshman backs, with Ull-
rich bettering Clark by about 10 yards
on the average. Although the frosh
got away from the veterans somc of
the time in running back punts, the
varsity men were showing that they
knew how to stop them effectively.
