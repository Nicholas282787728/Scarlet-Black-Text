now BIG KR}: WE?

Rumblings are becoming- londer and louder
ill indignant protest against Secretary of Labor
William N. Doah’s rcccnt rulings that foreign stu—
dents may not work their way through any Alnc
ican college or university. Very grandly, work for
be fl and room was excluded under certain Coll-
(li ons.

Tile ruling has been condemned, and rightly
we think, by college presidents from coast to coast,
including Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler of Columbia,
but so far nothing has hcen done to modify tllc rulc.

At Knox, Amherst, and Wesleyan colleges,
whcrc Jallallcsc students, holders of Bancroft
scholarships, have been forced by economic con-
ditions to accept part~time payment, the situation
is acute,

How big is our country anyway? Surely we
are not ill such financial straits that we must .2.
cludc even foreigners who desire to be educated
here.

Even if they do earn a dollar or two whilc in
the United States, very little, if any, gets out of
the vicinity in_wllicll it was earned.

, On the other hand, American students have a
real need for these students whom the secretary
of labor wishes to deport. As the editor of the
Oberlin Review declared ill his columns,

“A German is better able to tutor in his own
language than is an American. Why tell the Ger-
man he' must mow lawns or wash dishes, when his
tutoring would be a cat aid to us? Because if he
does not do the tutoring those unfamiliar with the,
language must do it, we see no more consistency
in Mr. Donlr’s recent lllodifications than ill his
original ruling. -

“The contact between students froln all over
the world has been tllc greatest valuc received
from the non-quota law. To refuse admittance to
a small numher of worthy foreign students is to
destroy the original purpose of the law. and to
remove a source of international good will.”

Ill da '5 of old a young lady‘s father offered

daughter. Now fathers spend $5,000 sending their
daughters to thc univc sity and still haven’t solved

STUDENTS AWAKE T0 SOCIAL CONDITIONS
(Daily Cardinal)

The American College student can never be accused
of being too sociallyconscions. So strong. however, is
the social-consciousness of the Europcan university stue
dent that riots and studentrdcmonstrations over political
and economic issues are not uncommon there. In Amer-
ica, riots of college students occur only at football
games.

However, there are signs that the social point of
View is beginning to assert itself on the American cam-
pus. Last year a group of students at Columbia uni-
versity decided that the reports of terriurism in the Ken-
tucky coat-fields just couldn't be true. However, instead
of consulting their textbooks about the constitutional
rights of the individual, the right: of habeas corpus, etc,
they decided to see for themselves what it was all about.
They did. And they didn't have to remain long in Kene
many to be convinced.

The purpose of the university. among other things.
is to awaken such social consciousness in the student.
He must learn about the things which men. constituting
society, have thought about and done for themselves
in the past, as well as the things which are left to be
done in the present and future in order that the things
which he does when he becomes a fullrfledged member
of society, will not impede. but aid, the creation of a.
better society,

That is what history, political science, physical
science. law, literature, anthropology, philosophyiiu
fact, all the fields of knowledgeiottempt to do. Insofar
as these subjects are pursued by students from this
social point of view, so far do we achieve a fruitful
education. Insofar as these subjects are pursued for
their own sake, divorced from the needs and considera-
tions of humanity as a whole, so far do we achieve only
a, sterile academicism. And insofar as We go to school
and study merely for the increased earning power or
better social status that a college degree supposedly
brings, so far do we achieve only a debasemeht of

learning and knowledge.
Social-mindedness is not. learned from the text-hook

and memorized. It is an attitude, an outlook on life, an
appraisal of the things which are socially signifieant.
it is awakened and fostered by means of school subjects
and text-books. But it can and frequently is better fos~
term by an extra-curricular interest in affairs outside
the classroom. some students, many on this campus.
are interested in improving political and economic con-
ditions in the state and country; they form Progressive
clubs. and social problems forums. others are interested
in preventing another catastrophic World vmr; they
organize Green Internationals and Anti~Whr congresses,
and protest against militarism still others are con-
cerned with the economic conditions of the laboring
classes; they organize expeditions and try to investigate
these conditions for themselves at first hand.

The list of these student aeti ities, even in America,
and even on this campus. is growing longer as students
are becoming more and more social—minded and pro-
gressive in their outlooks. It is a cause for rejoicing,
for it indicates that, after all, perhaps the citizens and
tax-payers are not spending their money solely for the
creation of renters at football games.

Now that Mary has done her dum-

he elaims the fault he finds in it hes
with the use of names. Wen, most
of the STUDENTS are not ashamed
to lime their names linked with their
