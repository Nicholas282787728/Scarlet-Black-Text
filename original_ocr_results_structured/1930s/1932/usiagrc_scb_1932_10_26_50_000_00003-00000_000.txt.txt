ure of most of his men to live up to
expectations. Some of them have
more than come through, but many
of the men whom Watt counted upon
to be outstanding have only been
mediocre.

Guards Weak

Against Washington, the guards
were especially weak. The best work
was done by Clarence Smelser, 190-
ouund sophomore reserve, who is de
termined to win a regular berth for
himself before the season ends. The
rest were not so good, for it was
through gaping holes in the center
of the line that the Washington backs
plowed for long gains.

McMillin at center vindicated him-
self, however, and was praised to the
skies by St. Louis sport critics. The
light sophomore center is sure to bear
his burden of the defensive work
against Drake Friday night.

The guards were not alone respon-
sible. other men are just beginning to
realize that more is expected of them,
and this feeling should materialize in
the Bulldog encounter.

Lineup Uncertain

Coach Watt is not sure just who
he will start against Drake, but there
Will probably be few radical changes.
Morgan and sutton are being drilled

through in grand style. Captain Gra-

certain of their positions.

The fourth member of the quartet
will probably be James, who for two
years has come awfully close to Star

"Spider” Alexander is another man
like James, although Alexander lacks
the ailsaround ability of his shifty

There are two more backs, Vic Fini

done little so far, but only because
they haven‘t had much of a chance
to show their wares.
