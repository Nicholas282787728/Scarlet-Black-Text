Years at Grinnell

This Spring

physics and mathematics at Crinncll

66 years of age.

Professor Almy was given leave of

of saving his life, his right leg was
amputated. Until the last few days,
it was thought that he would recover.

Almy, starting with almost no equip-
ment and limited funds, built up

tory which has served for many
years.

His ability as an instructor is best
shown by former students, who after
leaving Crimiell became noted in
their fields. Chief among these are
Dr. Samuel R. Williams, of Amherst;
Dr. Lloyd W. Taylor, of Oberlin; Dr.
Oliver Buckley, of the Bell Labora-
tories, world authority on submarine
cables; Dr. Leghitcn B. Morse, of
Columbia and Dr. H. ’H. Marvin, of
the University of Nebraska.

Frank Fayette Almy was born in
Little Compton, Rhode Island, Jan—
uary 12, 1366 and moved, with his
family, to southern Illinois. when he
was one year old. In 1879, the family
moved again to a farm near Green-
castle, Neb., where the boy grew to
manhood. He attended the country
schools and later the university of
Nebraska, where he was graduated
in 1890. The following year he went
to Johns Hopkins university for fur~
ther study, but in mid-year his father
died and he was called home to
Nebraska, where he assumed the du—
ties as head of the home. In the fall
of 1891, he was able to return to
Johns Hopkins, where he completed
a year of study.

Seven survive

In 1892 he was married in Ashland,
Neb, to Eva L. McReynolds. He Come
pleted another year at Johns Hop-
