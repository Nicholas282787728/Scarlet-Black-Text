Former Star

Third Time

Taylor’s Comeback Surprises
American Followers

at Los Angeles

The greatest Grinnell athlete ever
to set foot on a, cinder track, Morgan
Taylor. shattered all precedents and
rose to new heights in the final
Olympic tryouts held at Los Angeles
last week to qualify for a place on
the United States team in the 400-
meter hurdles for the third Consecu-
tive time. He holds the present Olym—
pic record in that race.

Taylor's performance is remarkable
in view of the fact that he has already
represented the United States twice
before in Olympic competition and is
at present thirty years old. Track
athletes will usually burn themselves
out in a short period of time, but
Taylor's remarkable stamina has car-
ried him through a ten-year period
of competition.

Taylor Wins Early Heats

Three preliminary heats were nec~
essary in the huge Stanford stadium
before the final decision was made.
The former Grinnell star, who is now
a member of the Illinois A. C., pro-
vided one of the sensations of Fri-

from qualifying. Taylor later won his
heat of the semi inals, beating Glenn
Hardin of Louisiana.

In the finals Hardin captured first
place, but was later disqualified when
the A. A. U. officials ruled that he
had interfered with Taylor, crossing
over in his lane and clearing the
wrong hurdle. This gave Taylor sec—
ond place, but inasmuch as only three
of the four finalists finished, Hardin
retained his place on the team.

Holds \Vorld’s Record

While yet a junior at Grinnell in
1924, Taylor acquired world-wide rec-
ognition. After taking high honors in
the valley meet in 1924, Taylor set a

tinctive evidences in the PreSchool

students who make observations on
the growth and methods of training
of the children.

ticular and to the college as a whole.
They help to a large extent in weld-
ing the new class together, they ans

pus and its customs, and they go a
long way toward making a loyal, en—
thusiastic, and unified class.

New students are to be divided his
to groups, each with a faculty ad»
visor, who is chosen according to the
major interest of the student. Two up-
perclassmen act as assistant advis-
ers. These groups are kept through-
out the year for registration pur»
poses, so that faculty advisers will
have an opportunity to know and in~
struct each student personally. Fresh-
men arc given an opportunity to meet
many of the student officers with
whom they are to work, and also be-
come acquainted with the principles
and operation of student government.

At the first meeting of new stu-
dents Tuesday evening, Miss Toinettc
Swan of the department of Public Re—
lations will preside, An introduction
of administrative officers, and ex-
planation of freshman registration

Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico.
He plans to return by a different
route, probably through the northern
section of the country.

The delegation Will reach LDS
Angcles by Wednesday if they do
not encounter misfortune, and will no
doubt economize by sleeping at the
more respectable tourist camps along
the Way. “If I can find any," Duke
adds.

Huff will get an opportunity to see
Morgan Taylor in action once again.
Taylor ran for the scarlet and black
when Huff was coaching here, and
was Huff's star pupil.

Last year Huff was presented to
the homecoming crowd between
halves of the Grinnell-Washington
game when he brought his Unlvers~
ity of Missouri two-mile team here

 

for a dual with the Pioneers.
