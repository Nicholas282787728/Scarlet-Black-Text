Men to Form Cross Country
Club Under Rosen’ s Direction

in a concerted effort to bring
about a mvival of interest in cross
country. an initial step is being tak—
en with the formation of the Crin-
nell Cross Country club, under the di-
rection of Coach Elton Rosen and
Captain Myron Pilbrow.

This club will take its place among
campus organizations, and its pub
pose is selﬂevident. mrtain require-
ments will be made for membership
in the club. These are: (1) One year's
experience in either varsity, fresh-
man, or intramural competition, or
(2) a performance of 2:10 or under,
in the half mile, or (3) 5:00 in the
mile, or (4) 11:10 in the two—mile.

Approximately a dozen candidates
for the varsity team have been work-
ing out this week. Although none of
them are in shape, it looks as though
Grlnnell should have the finest outfit
in the history of the school.

The Pioneer barriers will be led by
one of the nation’s foremost distance
stars, Mike Pilhrow, who earned a
nationwide reputation for himself on
the cinder track last spring. Barring
unfortunate mishaps, he is capable of
defeating any man the Pioneers will
run up against.

Another man who should place in
all of the meets is Joe Pfeiffer, who
began his first year of college compe-
tition with Coach Duke's track squad
last spring, He is an experienced
roadster and is at his best in the

PiOneers Won
in Downpour
a Year Ago

Leg Injuries Put Gould,

Rosenbloom, Bowlby,

on Sidelines

With a 20—0 victory over Penn als
ready under their belt, the Grinnell
Pioneers will be trying for their sec-
ond straight triumph when they meet
Dick Barkers Cornell college eleven
under the lights on Ward field Friday
evening.

Benny Douglas, former scarlet and
black captain, is now assisting
Barker at Mount Wrnon, and Doug-
las's presence in the Cornell camp is
a source of‘trouble for Coach Watt,
since the blonde athlete is thoroughly
familiar with the system used by the
Grinnell mentor here.

Watt May Have Trumps

Although Coach Watt will still
continue to rely somewhat on his old
plays, he may have a few trump
cards up his sleeve, If advance know-
ledge of Crinnell plays gives Cornell
a defensive advantage, Dick Ullrich
can be used to pull the game out of
the fire with his kicking ability. ml-
rich's prints would be a consistent
ground-gainer, if this mode of play
has to be relied upon,

Then. too, Watt uses a number of
plays which are almost unstoppable,
providing, of course, the offense does
its part. The famous spot pass play
seldom goes wrong, especially with a
receiver of Diincans type available.
Take No ‘Clianccs
Monday and Tuesday long drills
were in order, but tho Pioneer coach-
es forsook scrimmage sessions. With
Gould. Rosenbloom and Bowlby
on the sidelines no chances were
taken of further injuries. Gould and
Rosenbloom will be in shape for the
game against the Purple, but Bowlby
will probably not see service until the
Michigan State encounter.

The starting lineup for the game
Friday night is still undecided, but
it is likely that it will be similar to
the team used against Penn. Duncan
and McKee at ends, Gould and Lake
at tackles, Martin, Rosenbloom, or
Figland at guards, and McMillin at
center with ullrich, Craflund. James
and Alexander in the backfield is
a probable combination.

To Be Battle of Wits

The wise substitution of such valu-
able players as Fini, Hose, Morgan,
Sutton, and Phelps may turn the tide
in favor of the home team. It is by
no means certain that some of these
men will not be in the starting lines
up, but at any rate Coach Watt will
have 18 or 20 men whom he can
shoot into the game at strategic mo—
ment.

Spectators in the stands arc sure
to see a battle of wits Friday night.
The game will by all indications be
an improvement over the sluggish
contest last Friday, If the Pioneers
can click, they hold a slight edge over
the invaders,

Equip Fizosh
Today

Football equipment will be issued
this afternoon to all those in-
tending to go out for freshmen fonts
ball. Regular practice will probably
start tomorrow under the direction of
Coach Lester Dultc.

Apparently there will be a scarcity
of linemen s practically all those
who have si nificd their intention of
coming out seem to have had experi-
ence in the backfield,

The freshman s edule is confined
to November by Missouri Valley rcgu—
lation, fmd will probably includc
games- with Drake, Coe, and state
