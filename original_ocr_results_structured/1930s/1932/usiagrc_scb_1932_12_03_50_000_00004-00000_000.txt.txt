Came in 1902 ’
Professor Rusk came to Crinncll in ,
September, 1902, to assume the posi-
tion, he now holds in the department
of mathematics, and having remains
ed here ever since that time, he has
won the admiration and esteem of a
host of students and townspeople as
well as the entire college faculty.
Being a native of the Province of
Ontario, Canada, Mr. Rusk attended
the University of Toronto when: he
was graduated in 1895. After grad»
hating he spent three years as an
instructor in the Mathematics dee
partment of that university. He then
received a call from Bishops college
in Quebec where he taught for two
years. Before coming to Crinnell he
spent two years at the University of
Chicago working towards a Doctor’s
degree in Mathematics, He also
taught several classes there.
Compares Grinneu With Bisl'mp
In comparing Bishops college in
Quebec with Grinncll. both of which
are about the same size, Mr. Rusk
said. “Although that was a good
many years ago, there was little or
no college life at Bishops, A student
was there solely for scholastic de—
velopment and if he did not make
progress from year to year, he was
either forced to take the work over
or drop out. While at Grinnell we
have not only a scholarship equal to
that of any other school in the coun-
try, but a well rounded program which

 

elementary astronomy can be offered
to Grinnell students," he concluded.

Mr. Rusk holds both Bachelor and
Master of Arts deg-recs from the
University of Toronto and a Master
of Arts degree from Bishops college.
He is a member of the Mathematical
association of America and the Am~
erican Mathmatical society.

THEY’RE MlLDER

THEY TASTE BETTER

ouwould be astonished loo, if you

could see this machine that turns
out 750 Chesterﬁelds a minute.. and
every one as near perfect as cigarettes
can be made.

But please bear this in mind. It is
wlial happens before the tobacco goes
into this machine that matters mosL
Rolling and packaging are important,
but not nearly as important as the
selection, blending and treatment of
the tobacco,

That’s whywe keep tellingyou about
the tobaccos used in Chesterﬁelds.
They’re ﬁne, mild, and pure tobaccos.
We tell you about ageing and curing
the tobaccos . . . about blending and
cross—blending them . . . because they
are things that count.

Chesterﬁelds are milder. They taste
better, Prove it for yourself. . .Just
try a package.
