[By Associated Colic re Pier-l

Harvard, of all institutions, has been
quietly developing a cosmopolitan
viewpoint, to the utter surprise of
everyone west of the original 13 col.
onies. As evidence, we submit an
extract from an editorial in the Ear.
vard Crimson in which the editor
takes issue with the policy ot select.
ing eastern men tor the college cor.
poration:

"Will Harvard never have a man on
tho Corporation who is tree trom roots
of Boston cultivation? The
Corporation might employ Admiral
Byrd to find out what has happened
to the 40,000 graduates living west of
Worcester. a Down now freed from the
Indian menace, we are told,”

While papa Hue'y goes about the
nation with a bodyguard ot a score

a student at Leuislma Suite university
hurries from class to class with a wor.

the campus alone {or fear that some
enemy of her dad’s might see that

College Woman Says
Roosevelt Not Capable

NEW YORK CITY—(ACP)—The
President or the United States is in.
capable ot leading the nation the prcsi.
dent ot the Barnard college Libcrty
League, Miss Marie Reed Smith ’35,
believes.

Representing an ultra.conservotivc
group oi college women, which has
been in existenceforfive months, Miss
Smith stated that “Hoover was an ex.
cellent leader of the nation. but Rouse.
velt is incapable; he is swayed too
much by the radicals around him."

"We think that the people oi the
country are being swayed by emotion
and not by facts. We must ﬁrst re.
turn to the Constitution and then we
can be as radical as we wish. The
NRA is not the wish of the people;
it is unconstitutional and has been put
up arbitrarily. We must continue
under the time honored system of in.
dividunl initiative," she declared,

lt's Joe Brown, D. M. now. Whittier
college recently conterred on him the
degree. lt means “Doctor or Mirth."

hatemities at the University of
Michigan have been asked to save one
job in their kitchens or dining rooms
for an athlete.
