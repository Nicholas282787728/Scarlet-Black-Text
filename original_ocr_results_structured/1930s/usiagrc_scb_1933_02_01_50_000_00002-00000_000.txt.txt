SHALL WE HAVE THE PRUDITIES?

Shall ire—or shall we notghavc the “Pi-udir
ties” this year?

That i he question which will be discussed in
dormitory and quadrangle club rooms this week.

If the majority of students are in favor of rc-
viving the “Prudities,” traditional Grinnell col-
lege production which died o. rather unnatural
death a few years ago, the proposal will he placed
ill the hands of the Dramatic council—Which will
have the real say ill the matter.

\ththcr or not the council favors such a pre-
sentation of Gl‘ll‘mell talent. we hope that some sort
of all-college production will he put on this year, in
which the students themselves may have the pl‘lllr
cipal parts and which will be staged primarily by
the students,

Last year an attempt to revive the “Pruditics”
failed. Sketches presented by various halls and cot-
tages were not up to the standard required for the
production and even though permission of the Dray
lnatic council had been obtained, it was necessary
to drop the whole matter.

Therefore..in order to make the affair a sues
cess it would require the cooperation of all students
both in planning the various numbers and ill exc-
cuting them,

Such productions illeall workalots of woi
but they are well worth the effortgif they do
nothing more than bring the men and w men of
the various halls and cottages tog‘ether in one
worthwhile project.

Some faculty members and students doubt
Whether or not a musical comedy is worthwhile. We
think it is. After all, humor ha, its placcicven durr
ing the current moratorium on prosper

EXPLANATION

A letter to the editor, written as a result of
an editorial, “Big Talk”, which appeared in The
Scarlet and Black Saturday, is published ill the
“What Do You Think?” column today.

In answer to the first question asked, we lint»
urally answer that We picked out the editorial. If
we have given the impression that we were trying
to use it as an example of what all other students
are thinking and doing~we are sorry. However.
We must still believe that it shows what some
other students are doing and thinking.

The second questionﬁol‘ series of questionsi
is as easily answeredﬁbut lnuch more important.

We would like it clearly understood that any
“retorts” we made in our editorial were made-—
not at the American Legion—hut in answer to
certain caustic and uncalled for remarks made ill
the Legion‘s Iowa paper, by its editor,

Therefore, unless we really are “yoppillg pup-
pies”, we don’t feel any more undignified than
Editor Miles should. ‘-‘

When we said “bigot", we certainly did not
mean Norman Hall, Robert Kerr, or Hartford Mac»
Niderilnen for whom we have the highest esteem.
We met Mr. MocNidcr when he was here for Alum-
ni chapel last fall, and our consciences would be
bothering us pretty badly. if we had.

We regret that this misunderstanding and
subsequent controversy, which arose from a reprint
editorial, has occurred

Other Opinions

AGGnEssrvnNEss
(Brown and White)

College students, and to a great extent. college pi-oe
fessors, live in a world apart. They live in an academic
world where the rigors of competition which are to be
met in the outside do not enter. This separation of the
academic from the commercial has been urged as bene-
ficial. both to student and professor. and to a certain
extent it, is benefi al. The purely scientific and scholarly
attitude is fostered. There is no undue strain or worry
about making a sale ahead of some one else or beating
a competitior’s price This is no doubt an aid to study.

It seems. however. that the harm that is done is
greater than the benefits, There is no necessity to keep
eternally on one's toes. There is little need for aggres-
siveness. The result is that after four years. much of

the spirit of resourcefulness, which is the greatest help
to success, is gone. That this aggressiveness and re-
sourcefulness is lacking was demonstrated recently in a
quiz. Practically the entire class of over a hundred men
failed on one question which had been lectured on re-
peatedly. Their excuse was tiiut they had never under-
stood what it was all about. Rather than go out and
find somebody to explain it to them they Just let it slide!
is it reasonable to expect that when they go out and
try to get a job they will radically change?

Part of the blame for this attitude has with tiie
educational system which pamper-s and pets men for
four years. There should be more incentive to aggres-
siveness in our colleges and universities. The greatest
trouble however. is with the men themselves. When a
man is old enough to go to college he should realize that
he is preparing himself for a life where he will have to
struggle for what he gets. and he should start going
after things when he matriculates, not when he gradu-
ates. If he does this he will find himself better pres
pared for life than if he knew all the science and on-
gineering that can be learned,

(Daily llLini)

We must remember that although a group of men
may go through the same preparation for a particular
task. there will be no two alike. You see all about you
every day on the campus men and women who are being
given exactly the same‘ instruction that you are getting,
some of these men and women will turn out to be finally
great successes, and some of them will be just as corals
pletely failures.

This cannot be due altogether to a. difference of
opportunity if we presuppose the same curriculum for
everyone in the university who will eventually be in
competition with one another, and that each one had
the same chances. Of course the process of distribution
and the fateful quirks of environment may make or
break a certain number. but there are those who will
come out on top no matter what environment they land
in.

Editor. The Scarlet & Black.
Dear Sir:

I have noticed the reprint of an editorial in your
issue of Jan. 4; the comments of Frank Miles in the
lows Legionairc; the retol‘ts of your column tonight.

Might I as a Grinnell alumnus~a Legionaire and
sort of interested citizen ask you a couple of questions?

I have read the reprint of the editorial from the
Northwestern paper and I fail to get any sense out of
it. There is a statement about claptrap and heery
breath and American Legion conventions. Then there
is the statement that several million corpses in France
were piled up in France as a smelly monument to the
sweet name of democracy. 1 fail to get any continuous
sense out of the editorial and fail to see but one reason
for publishing the editorialithat it attacked the
American Legion. If I am Wrong~1 will listen to the
explanation but the editorial refers to a certain letter
and since the letter does not appear one simply has
left the attack on the Legion.

Now I am sure that I would like to ask you two
questionSrrfirst, who picked out this editorial to be used
as an example of what students are “doing and think-
ing"?

Secondido you think that you were dignified when
you came back and relorted—“bigots”??? Do you think
that Legionaires Norman Han, Bob Kerr and many
thousands of other former Grinnellites liked that? Also
what do you think of men like Trustee Degionaire Mac-
Nider',’ He is quite a speaker yet his speeches have
never been of the "claptrap or beery type,

Well it's interesting to read a college paper~when
r was a reporter on the S. a: B. many years ago we
used to clip Exchangesi'but having served in the Te-
porting section on athletics, etc, I never got in on the
editorial work.

Perhaps Legionaires are rather outspoken but you
will find out some day that they are human and that
the part of the reprint that I didn’t. like was the refer-
ence to the “smelly monument” of corpses piled up in
France. My old classmate Fred McNulty. ’16 of East
High Des Moines school before he came to Grinnell. is
buried "over there” and also Glen Swan '17. Bill Focht
'13 is another—and many more. I think of them in a
different way than you allowed your paper to speak—
even if it was a reprint. Perhaps the answer to my first
questionelf I get it—will tell me why you used the
editorial which was really not an editorial but just
comment on a letter which the readers of the S. & B.

- didn’t: get to see.

Yours truly.
Russell C. George. ’16
Editor. The Scarlet and Black
Dear Sir: ,

Generally. it is the student body that is tossed onto
the frying pan for lack of enthusiasm and spirit. It is
time that the situation reversed and an explanation is
given for the continued failure of the basketball team
to make a good showing in most of the games played
thus far. The battle with Creighton was the team's only
display of any commendable merit. WE WANT To
KNOW WHAT IS WRONG.

It may be of interest to the athletic department
to know that many Crinneli business men are refusing
to attend any further basketball games here. Not only
are these men displeased with continued detest but. they
are opposed to the Show made when going down to de~
feat.

The student body and Grinnell business men have
tolerated these wet—rag basketball tactics to the point
where they are ready to throw up their hands and gasp.
“What's the use?" Nor is this all the pressure that is
being brought to bear on everyone of us.

The clouds are gathering to blocken the sky and
far in the distance can be heard the rumble of the on-
coming storm of alumni protest. It is time we were
given a satisfactory explanation for this continued fail-
ure that we might be equipped to answer this alumni
protest. or course, the best answer would be a victory.
