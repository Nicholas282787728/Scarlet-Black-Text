Plan Revised

“5" Average Basis
of Change; Applies
to Upperclassmen

Requirements for the unlimited
cut privilege have been amended
to include upperclass students
having at least an “S” average
and no grade below “B." Bethana
McCandless, registrar, announced
today.

Under the original plan instie
gated this year to conform with
the new grading plan, the pl‘lvir
lege applied only to junior and

senior students having- no gl‘adesl

lower than us" in any subject.
Comparison

The ”S" grade in the new sys
tem corresponds to a high "B" or
low “A” in the system used last
year when the privilege was given
students having no grade below
“B," Miss McCandless said.

The ruling denying unlimited
cuts on the days immediately pre-
ceding and following vacations
remains in force. .

Cuts Unchanged

The change made earlier this
year lowering from 14 to nine the
numher of cuts allowed freshmen
and sophomores without the loss
of an hour's credit, also remains
unchanged, according to Miss
McCandless.

Twentysfive seniors, 19 Juniors
and 16 sophomores are listed as
qualifying for unlimited cuts, she
said.

“Czarist Empire
Was Autocratic,
Corrupt Regime”

“The Russian Czar-ist empire
was an autocratic, orthodox, Ink
perialistic, inefficient, and corrupt
regime," was the statement made
by Dr. Walter M Kotsclmig, when
he spoke Tuesday evening in Her-
rick chapel. on tho subject. “U.
s, s, R.: The Materialist Myth”

He characterized the Russian
people with three traits, although
omphasizmg the fact that this
could only apply to the average
Russian, and not to all the nation-
alities and faiths represented in
that cotintry.

The average Russian, according
to the speaker, is a product of
the soil, a mixer after the abso-
lute in the realm of nature, and
a gregarious creature.

He concluded by stating that
the Russia of today no longer
threatens our western social
order, or the peace of the world,
and that
they ever wnl.
