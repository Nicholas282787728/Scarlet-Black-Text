Date of Razz

Fest Named
by Committee

Homecoming Group Decides
on Nov. 17 Following
Vote of Women

At a mass meeting of the women
of the college, held in the little the-
atre of the quadrangle last night, a
vote was almost unanimous in favor
of holding the gridiron banquet in
the Women’s dining room as part of
the homecoming program.

The special meeting was called by
Dorothy Thompson, president of the
\Vomen’s Self Government league, at
the request of the homecoming com-
mittee. According to Miss Eleanor
Lowden, head of the committee, it

was deemed advisable to find out if‘

the women were willing to give up
their dining room before sanctioning
the banquet.
Nodete Affair

Sponsored by the Grinnell chapter
of Sigma Delta Chi, national profesV
sional journalistic fraternity, the
gridiron razz banquet will be held

Friday. Nov. 17, from 6 to 8 p, m. in-

the quadrangle dining room. As the
homecoming play is not slated to
begin until 8:30 a, m., the banquet
will not interfere with its presenta-
tion, those in charge have announced.

A non-date affair, the razz fest
will be open to all students, alumni
and out of town gucsts, Men and wo-
men who regularly eat in the college
dining rooms will be charged less
than other guests; this fee covering
only the cost of decorations, enter-
tainment, and the special razz “news"
sheet which will be given to every—
one who attends.

Arrangements will be made for
women who do not go to the ban—
quet to eat in the men’s dining room
that evening.

To Feature Humor

Featuring stunts, skits. acts, surr
prises, razzing and general merry—
making during the dinner and in a
special program afterward, the grid
iron banquet should provide entertain-
ment for studcnts and guests, alike,
according to representatives of Sig-
ma Delta Chi.

A committee of Richard Steiner,
Frank Beatle, King Park and Marvin
Teget, chairman, is in charge of
skits and stunts as well as the razz
sheet. John Ramsey has been ap-
pointed to take care of business de-
tails.

European Youth
Social, Liberal
Vanguard-Payne

“Youth should take a greater part
in social affairs," declared Charles
E. Payne, professor of history, at
the last meeting of the Sunday Eve-
ning club.

In his talk on “Youth and the
World C Professor Payne told
his audience of more than 40 stu-
dents that it was the youth of,Eur-
ope who were the vanguard of‘ lib-
eralism and social progress there.
“In England,” the professor said,
"many of the students of Oxford.
Cambridge, and other schools have
declared their intentions to hear no
arms in any future war, Thc more
progressive of the English college
students have joined the Labor
party.”

Professor Paync believes that the
Germans and the Russians want
peace, and that the bclligercncy of
the Germans would die down if they
were not discriminated against by
Selfrseeking nations,

”The American student should
think for himself, and not neglect the
social sciences,” concluded the speak-
er.

Raymond B. McClenon, professor
of mathematics, made some clarify-
ing remarks on some of the questions
concerning German attitudes.

Library Staff

Vetoes Sunday
Opening Plant

‘Advantage Must be Taken
of Fridays, Saturdays
First,’ Says Clark

“when it appears that students
are taking advantage of Fridays and
Saturdays, the library staff will be
glad to entertain ideas for a
change,'l“Miss Isabelle Clark, college
librarian, said yesterday in an inter-
view with Robinson Shoulbcrg.

The Council of House Presidents,
through Mr. Shoulbcrg, president of
Gates hall, has been trying to make
arrangements whereby the library
would be open until a later hour in
the evening, and open for reading
hours Sunday afternoon,

Staff Shortage

Shortage of the library staff, closed
stacks and reserve books, as well as
shortage of time between Sunday
dinner and vespers were reasons giv-
cn by Miss Clark for not opening the
library Sunday afternoons. ”The on-
ly alternative would be to open the
library as a reading room, and this
would not solve the problem,” the
librarian said.

At present the library closes at
9:30 p. m. week days to facilitate
taking home reserve books by stu-
dents who wish to go home early.
Later hours would complicatc this
advantage, Miss Clark believes,

“Willing to Help"

There is a possibility of alleviating
the problem by placing freshman res
serve books in the fourth floor Main
study hall.

The library staff is willing to re-
ceive any constructive criticism from
students, and is willing to aid any—
one who cannot use the library dur-
ing regular hours by trying to ar-
range his library work with him,
Miss Clark stated.

Annual Struggle
for Fresh-Sop}:
Not Yet Planned

Plans for the annual freshmen
sophomore scrap have been changed
because of the expense necessary to
attain equipment. The original plan
was to secure a huge medicine ball

tween the two classes on Ward ficld,

Floyd Horton, as a representative
of the Council of House Chairmen,
wrote to athletic officials of Drake
university and one college in an atl
tempt tc borrow or rent the suitable
equipment. Answers from these insti-
tutions indicated that.the expense
would be far beyond the figure that
the council deemed wise to spend on
such a project.

At the regular meeting of the
council Thursday night, more defin-
ite plans will be made in order that

Conard Says Old Testament Books
Dangerous Unless Referred to New

Professor Uses Quotations
From Bible to Prove

Points ‘0‘: Speech

“The Bible is a dangerous book if
the Old Testament is used as a guide
to presentrday morals without refer»
ence to the New Testament," der
clared Henry S. Collard, professor of
botany, at vesper services in Herrick
chapel Sunday.

“For example,” he said, ”the fee
ligious leaders of all countries during
the World war blcsscd their soldiers,
and justified themselves with quota-
tions from the Old Testament,"

Eanrnplc of Search

That this stand is not the true
Christian one, according to Mr. Con-
ard, is proved by the true identity
of the Bible. which is a remarkable
example of the pcrsistcnt and insist-
ent search for righteousness on tho
part of the Hebrew people.”

To illustrate the development of
the Christian religion, Professor Con-
ard compared quotations from Joshua
and Chronicles of the Old Testament
and Ezekiel of the New Testament.
Quotations from the former told

 

“how the Lord helped his people to
defeat their enemies in battle,"

A different tone is presented in
Ezekiel, declared Professor Cunard,
when Jehovah said to cast away the
proverb that “the fathers have eaten
sour grapes and the children's teeth
are set on edge.

Swords Into Plowsliaros

“The Lord told Ezekiftl that the
son should not bear the iniquity of
the father nor the father that of the
son. And Isaiah proclaimed, 'They
shall beat their swords into plow-
shares. . . and nation shall not lift
up sword against nation)”

"The interpretation of righteous-
ncss changed still more in the New
Testament; Jesus corrected the old
low point by point. To ‘Thou sllztlt
not 1011’, he added, ‘Whosocvcl' shall
be angry with his brother without
cause sllftll be in danger of judg»
mentx For the old ‘cye for an eyo,’
be substituted, ‘Love your enemics,
bless them that curse you.‘

“The Bible is a marvelous hook,"
Professor Connrd concluded, “and a
precious legacy from the post.
but that use of it is pernicious which
draws for the moral codes of today
from passages which the Bible itself
has later refuted."

 

Thanksgiving Day
Subject of Vote;
Mermen Get $250

Petitions asking for dismissal of
classes on the Friday following
Thanksgiving were being circulated
on the campus Tuesday, following
the dccision of the student Council
Sunday afternoon to determine stu-
dent opinion upon the subject.

If the petitions are signed by a
majority of the students, the council
will recommcnd to the college ad-
ministration the extension of the
Thanksgiving vacation to include
Friday.

Approval of a $250 appropriation
for expenses of the swimming team
was also given by the council. The
money is to be taken from a floating
fund created by a reapportionment
of semester fee receipts by the Stu-
dent Council last spring.

A varsity swimming schedule this
year was assured by receipt of the
sum of $250 by Dave Malhrough,
student swimming coach, Sunday af-
ternoon from semester fee funds
controlled by the Student Council.

Malbrangh is attempting to obtain
several meets with schools which the
undefeated tank team of last year
opposed, and it is possible that ar—
l‘engements will include Nebraska
university, Iowa State college,
Creighton, and the Midwest A. A. U.
meet.

In addition to a varsity schedule,
the crack freshman outfit may hold
a home meet with some Y. M. C. A.
team; possibly that of Newton.

Creighton Has
1 8 Lettermen
on Grid Squad

Coach Watt Shifts Lineup

for Second Conference

Game .of Season

By JACK KELSEY

A one—man team, without that one
man, is the Creighton football eleven
that invades the Pioneer gridiron
Friday night for a Missouri Valley
conference game.

At the beginning of the season
the Bluejay mentor was confident
that his team would bowl over all
competition, take the Missouri Val-
lcy conference title, and place Cap—
tain “Corny" Collin on an all—Amer.
ican team. All of his hopes were
blasted when the tow-headed flash
received a leg injury early in the
season.

FROSH DISPLAY

All freshman‘ women will be
seated in a body at the Grin-
nell-Crcightcn game Friday
night, possibly on the Creigh—
ton side of the field.

New yells are being prac-
ticed to be introduced to the
student body at the game, and
the women are also planning to
present a display with cards.

There is a meager possibility that
Collin Will be able to compete against
Grinnell, and in that case the local
fans are liable to see a. good exhibi-
tion of football on the part of this
luminary; that is, if he was able to
store up his abilities for the games
to he played after his injury was
nursed.

The scores of the Creighton play-
ers have been very disappointing to
most sports writers. They were tied
by the Haskell Indian eleven, lost. a
conference gamc to Drake’s surprise
eleven, and barely eked out a victory
over Rice Institute last week. Dc-
spite its deficiencies, however, the
Creighton team is Still powerful, and
will give the Pioneers a. hard battle,
before Watts men manage to win
their first game of the season.

Eighteen Lcttermen

Coach Art Stark boasts of 18 let-
terrnen, with Gordon, James, Camp-
bell, and Lennon, taking the brunt
of the l‘espon'stllility in the backfield
since Collin has been put out of
commission. The squad also has sev-
eral capable sophomore backs.

The Bluejays have two guards who
are playing their third season, Tom-
