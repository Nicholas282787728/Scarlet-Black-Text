Editor

The Scarlet and Black
Grinnell, Iowa

Dear Slr:

The farmer freshman practice ﬁeld
in front of the dormitories lacks an
appropriate title, Several men of the
present student body have suggested
the name “MacEachron Field.”

Just to mention the man Paul
MacEnchron brings forth the highest
possible praise and admiration from
Gn'nnell alumni and faculty. Grinnell
men of today who have had the good
fortune and privilege of meeting him
have quickly caught something or
his “square-shooting" qualities, which
made him so vital to Grinnell student
life during his undergraduate days
and his work as dean of men.

Path MacEschron graduated with
the class of 1911. having been out-
standing on the basketball court and
closely identiﬁed with all phases of
college life. After a period in Grinnellr
in—Chine, he came to Grinnell as dean
of men in 1922. He was strongly i -
terested in making athletics a signi -
cant part of the college. Being frank
and outspoken, he won the confidence
of the men of Grinnell. Led by the
highest ideals, he met students on
their own grounds. The men always
knew Where he would stand. In his
enthusiastic eagerness to work un—
ﬂinchingly, men found the courage
and inspiration to fulﬁll their own
hard tasks. Just to meet him. was
to realize the true Grinnell spirit,
which so many have tried to deﬁne.

Paul MacEachron left Grinnell to

death in a trhgic accident. He was to
Oberlin what Rockne was to Notre
Dame. He never forgot Grinnell. To
know him was to know the truest
of all Grinnellians,

President Main said of him, “The
passing of Paul MacEachron is a per
sonal loss to Grinnell , . . To hie per»

“MacEachron Field” would be a
