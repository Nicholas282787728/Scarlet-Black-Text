Seniors Teach Upstarts
A Few Cage Tricks
to Win 34-25 Monday

I
Senior members of 1935736 cagc ‘

team bid farewell to Grill—
nell basketball Monday afternoon
by trimming next year‘s squad 34A
25 in a rough and tumble affair.
Leading 17-9. next season's squad
walked off the floor at the half!
with beaming smiles as if the old
men were a “joke team". At the
end of the third quarter, the sen-
iors had closed in, coming within
a point of tying the score which
read 21720. Before the final quar-
ter was five minutes old, they
were six points ahead, and tbenl
went on to increase their advan-‘
tage to nine before the final whis-
tle ended the contest.
Luther and Liiick of the new‘
squad opened the scoring for thei
new men with Hal Dean following‘
in for another basket. Oliphant
was the only senior who was able
to connect for buckets in the first‘
quarter, plunking in a pair of‘
goals, Dean scored another bucket
before the first quarter ended 9-4,

In the second stretch, Sampsori‘
of the new squad substituted for
LaMasney, who scored but a sin_-
gle point during the entire contest.
Sampson wasted no time and fired
in three goals, while Riley addedl

one more. i

'In the meantime Oiiphant and
Bradley of the seniors were tbe
only scorers. The old timers, how-
ever, missed shot after shot under
the basket.

In the last two quarters, Bauer,
Klepfer, and McMui-ray went on
a. scoring spree, collecting 25,
points to outscore their opponents
who were able to get only nine
points.

Klepfer and Bauer copped the
high scoring honors of the day, the
former getting 11 points and the
latter ninc. Oliphant made eight,|
Sampson of next year's squad was
high man for his team with eight
points.

Cased, had to go to bed, because the
doctor ordered it; but that didn't
prevent her from attending class-
es.

She did it by proxy, ‘sending her
mother daily to pick up assign-
ments, at the same time turning in
previouslyrasslgned work. The
system brings high grades, Miss
Crawford reports.

According to an official bulletin
published by Kansas State Normal
school in November, 1902, “it
would be a shame if any teacher
college student should be arrested
for riding a bicycle at a rate of
speed exceeding the lawful limit!“

GRINNELL SCARLET ANTS

Glancingﬁack

(By Albert Manny)
40 Years Ago.

"The opening number the
jomt inceting was an autobiogra-
phy by Mr. St. John, which was
startling, even if not true."

4‘ '93 gathered in the parlors of
Miss Flora Goodfcllow's place of
residence last evening. The fear
turc of the evening was the guess-
ing of advertisements. The vir»
ginia Reel tbcn furnished amusc-
ment until the hour of departure.’

The modern group in the Art
Exhibit included Hoffman's “Christ
in the Temple" and “The Children
of Charles I," by Van Dyke,

e s e
30 Years Ago.

“The first annual debate of the
Iowa Triangular Debating league,
Ames, Drake, and Grinnoll, will be
held on Friday evening. The ques—
tion is one of the burning issues
of the day, the question of railway
rote regulations,"

“The program was opened by a
musical number rendered by the
Carney Bros. B, J. Carney played
the violin, K. Carney the cello,
while C. T. Carney presided at the
piano. A paper on sporting by
Carl Bair followed this number.
The paper was full of jokes and
kept the audience in a continuous
uproar. Except for musical num»
bers, the grainophone throughout
the evening discourscd sweet mun
sic. The program was an unusur
ally unique one and was enjoyed
by a large audience whose interest
in the performance did not lag for
a moment."

20 Years Ago.

The Grinnell baseball schedule,
including two games each with
Ames, Iowa, Coe, Cornell, and
Simpson, was to begin April 21
and to end June 2.

Because of the awakening of I117
terest in GrinnelHanhina, about
10 students formed a class which
taught Chinese by Entang H. Hon,
’16,

The allrIowa basketball team in—
cluded two players from Grinnell,
and one each from Coe, Iowa, and
Ames,

“During the recent Associations
carnival in the Men's gymnasium
a girl's switch, made of hair that
cost as. and valued much greater
than that by the owner, mysteri-
ously disappeared from a side-
show museum, Because of the in-
convenience that this has caused
to both the borrowers and the
lender, the switch should be re—
turned at once to the gym office.”

College Students
Enter Protest
to Senate Bill

Albany, N. Y.7(ACP77A horde
of indignant young college men
and women. accompanied by a
dozen adult sympathizcrs, descend
ed upon thc New York State Sella
ate last week to protest against
the sorcalled Nunaii student oath
bill, which would force all students
in colleges, universities and nor-
mal schools supported wholly or
in part by state funds to swear
allegiance to the state and Federal
Constitution.

More than 30 colleges and UHF
vei-s es were represented, but it
wasn't easy for the students to
get their comments into the rec-
ord. Senator A. Spenccr Feld.
Democrat, who presided at the
hearing, lost no time in informing
the pi-otcstants that he would do
his best to hold down their tesur
mony, Senator FeId became so 1h
ritated at the testimony of one
that he had him forcibly removed
from the ﬂoor.

The person involved was Joseph
P. Lash, representing the Amerir
can Student Union, Questioned on
the Union's attitude toward the
Oxford oath, Lash said that if
swearing allegiance to the Consti-
tution meant members could not
take the Oxford oath “than we will
fight to the end, and we can ﬁght."

“Fight, did you Say?” inquired
Senator Felrl facetiously. "I
thought you were against war.”

“I think," said Lash quietly,
"that that pun was unworthy of
your high position."

A roar of laughter greeted this
sally, and the senator’s face turned
a bright crimson, Hc slammed
down his gavel and announced that
Lash had said enough, ordered the
sergeantatral‘ms to throw him
out.’
