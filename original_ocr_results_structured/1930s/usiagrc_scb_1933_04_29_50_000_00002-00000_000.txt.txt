S. O. S.~SAVE OUR SWIMMERS

Which shall we laneizt varsity swimming
team of championship caliber, such as the nude-
feated squad of this year, or a varsity debate
team which makes numerous t i s to engage in
llo»decisioll encounter "

As was brought out in a recent meeting of
the Student council, the Grinnell debate squad
receives an annual stipend of 5 per cent of the
money obtained from the sale of semester fcc
books. Tllis year it will total between four and
five hundred dollars.

Five—or even four—hundred dollars to keep
alive a dying intercollegiate sport, when the axe
pauses of varsity swimming trips have to be. borne
by interested Grinuell alumni—or not at all!

According to Louis V, Phelps, treasurer of
the college, the expense of last year’s swimming
schedule, c clusivc of Coach Elton Roscn’s salary,
was approximately $225. It is uudcr‘tood that
$200 will take care of the proposed sr-hcdlllc ucxt
year—if. there is a schedule.

We have nothing against members of the dc-
baie squad personally, or the coach. But, we do
think that when several of these members are free
to say that intercollcgiatc debating is ill bad
shape all ’round. and that nothing can be done
about it it is. needless to say, extravagant to try
to keep it goin

Realizing tlli but not wishing to deal debat-
ing the death blow ill one fell swoop. the Student
council has already cut 2 per cent from the do
hate allotment, and given it to the International
Relations conference for next year.

We believe that at the joint lucetillg of old
alld new councils, May 7, the student representa-
tivcs should “go all the way” and (ran. or the
remaining 3 per cent to va sl ' swimming.

Jf they are not willing to do (his, they should
at least divide the allotment equally hctwcoll the
L\\'0 organizations. Then, the amount obtained
from alumni, the proceeds of the Brown Derby
Drag, May 6, etc., may make it easier for Grinllcll
college to have a 19.4 swimming Icnln.

G
DOWNFALL OF GRINNELL’S STUDENT
GOVERNMENT

The firing on Fort Sumter blcw tllc lid off
the kettle of brewing conflict between the forces
of secession and those of a strong union and the
ensuing warfare illuminated the many grievances
of the opposing parties. The prepping issuc ill
Grilulcll is another Sumter and the struggle be-
tween studcnt government advocates and faculty
rulcrs may mean another Civil War.

The destruction of Sumter robbed the North
of a mighty stronghold and so hits the destru ion
of prepping robbed student government of its
mightiest stronghold.

Three years ago the wearing of prep caps on
this campus would have been appraiscd in undy-
ing tradition. Today the Honor G club has a long
list containing names of freshmen, who have been
seen almost regularly without their prep caps.
Except for verbal admonitions, the club has no ad-
equate method of enforcing this tradition.

The prohibition of smoking on the main cam-
pus was long it well respected tradition main
tained by the Honor Gr club, but it, too. has fallen
into discard with the denial of euforcclllcnt pow-
ers.

Prepping has been hagglcd over long enough.
That student government has been denied the
power to enforce self created rulcs asd traditions
we accept as final until the issue s reopcncd by
the faculty. Every student and faculty member
is thoroughly familiar witll the pros alld cons of.
the prepping is no. These need no rcitcratioll.
However, we do see in the destruction of. one stu-
dent government stronghold fllrthcr destruction
of other fortresses and ill the end, complete anni-
llilatioll of the government itself.

Excluding the prepping issue, there are other
factors giving evidence that student government ill
Grillucll is on the wane. If the displacement of
student government with faculty rule is a Sign of
progress ill our college life, then God speed the
downfall of the former.

THE LAW
(Daily Trojan)

It is amazing to note the great ignorance prévar
lent among the common herd as to the exact position
of the law in their daily turn of life. There is nothing
more obvious than the palpable fear which the aver»
age man entertains for the machinery of the law.

It has been said by a prominent lawyer that in
the courts, three business men out of ten. upon being
asked to place their right hand on the Bible to take
oath, will place their left hand instead. such goes to
show the attitude which is common among us.

If it were only known that if anyone is brought
up in court and accused of anything, the accused has
every advantage that can be given him. Every factor
is interpreted in his favor that is possible. He is giv-
en the option of a quick trial. He is given the advan-
tage of appeal to the highest authorities in the land.

if a judgment is given, or a law is passed, under
even the slightest circumstances. the law is backed up
by every officer of the law, every soldier, and if nec»
essary, in in theory backed up by every means of
fore in the empire.

In these modern days, and especially within the
British Empire, the law is one of U19 most potent
forces available. The law is set by the various legis-
lative assemblies and powers are implemented by the
courts, and as such the courts are the final and all
powerful means of preserving law and order in the
country. If a law is passed in the parlaiment it will
be tested in the courts and declared intra or ultra
virea. Once established. it cannot be set aside.

The judge on the bench is probably for weaker
physically than the accused, yet he is chosen by rea—
son of his knowledge of the law and equity. The 12
jurors are taken from ordinary walks of life. They
represent a. cross section of society. Furthermore, if the
accused thinks that any one is given the opportunity
of challenging them. and having them replaced to his
satisfaction.

Probably the most that any college student has
to do with the law has been when he has received a
ticket for speeding and is hailed before the local magiSr
trates. One cannot gain a knowledge of the law from
that.

If every man and woman visited the courts, even
if only once, he or she might gain some knowledge of
how the country is governed, and how they are pro-
tected in every way by the law. What is conducive for
a. well-organized and harmonious community is known
ledge and respect for the law, not ignorance and fear.

lilLL THE HORSE AND GET A CAR
(Daily Oklahoman)

Education in America is the one antiquated p see 01
machinery in a country which keeps religiously oparc
with the latest advancements made in all other fields. In
developing our youth we retain the methods which have
been in force for generations.

There are exceptions, of course. We have the Uni»
versity of Chicago, where individual initiative is encour»
aged and mental development is stressed. But we have
hundreds of colleges and universities with their foolishly
required courses, their compulsory class attendance
rules, their archaic grading methods, and their medieval
disciplinary exactions. .

Many are the brilliant graduates of American edur
cational institutions. But how many more might there
have been had the educational machinery been im-
proved? If a student graduates from college any more
mentally mature than when he matriculated it is dee
spite, not because, of the method by which he was given
his education. Too many of ollr college graduates go
forth with their shoulders bent under the burden of cam-
plis keys. their brains cluttered with useless dates, the-
ories and poems which they memorized, and of facts
learned by rote. Too few of them go forth with an alert
outlook, with a broader vision and a. questioning mind,
which, after all. should be one of the aims of a college.
If a student could be taught to question, his education
would not have been in vain.

Dr. Stephen Butler Leaooek. economist of McGill
university, recently delivered a stinging criticism of ed-
ucational methods in a speech given at the annual meet-
ing of the English Speaking union in Chicago.

“The last of the students is dead.

“What we need is the old fashioned professor who
was a little flusterated and a. little foolish. There are no
more of them.

“Our universities kill poets all the time. If a poet
comes to us we soon knock it out of him with required
courses and examinations."

Dr. Leacock has earned something of a reputation
as a humorist, but these were words, not of humor, but
of wisdom.

Music Seldom Heard

ny H. w. MllTL on
(Professor of Organ)

These indefatigable workc ., Prof.
Sarah I. MacDonald and Prof. David
E Peck, deserve the profound trib-
utc of this community for their zeal
in discovering music which otherwise
we would seldom hear. The skill and
graciousncss of their authoritative
playing exalts their performance to
a place among the most valuable
forces in our cultural life, and it is
a pleasure to say so at every opporv
tunity.

Of the three sonatas, by Bilrlcigh,
Sjoegren, and Beethoven, which they
played Thursday evening I gained the
most enjoyment from the one by
Emil Sjoegren, who was to Sweden
what Grieg was to Norway, embodyr
ing in musical form the naive racial
melodies which seem so exotic to us.
but which to native Scandinavians
seem as natural as the pine—laden
air of their forests, which only vis-
itors can detect.

High spot

The third movement of this sonata.
the andante, seemed to strike the
high spot of the evening so far as
expressiveness is concerned. though
it be heresy to say so considering the
Beethoven sonata in c minor with
its lovely adagio eantabile which
followed.

But these earlier Beethoven compo-
sitions, in which the gaiety of his
musical progenitor “Papa." Haydn is
still paramount, and which consist so
largely of the search for interesting
and beautiful tonerpatterns for their
own sake, unmindful of the grave
undercurrent of tragedy whose dis-
tinct thunder is faintly heard, even
in this early quartet, these composi—
tions charm us but somehow fail to
move us profoundly. Sjoegrcn, al—

Adeline Light to Present
Piano Recital Wednesday

Adeline Light will present a piano-

closer to reality in his quartet than
did the young Beethoven.

Curiosity rather than we took
hold of me in the “Ascension” quar-
tct by our contemporary American,
Cecil Burlcigh. Attempts have been
made to embody personalities, sacs
rod or profane, in tone for more than
20o years. The first actual "sonatas"
were written on Biblical characters
by Bach’s great predecessor Johann
Kuh, in 1696, while Each was still a
little boy.

There is no question that the gifts
ed Burleigh has written a fine quar-
tet. but there is grave question as
to what he meant by its title and the
scripturc texts. It seems to me a fine
and melodious compOSILion in the roe
mantic style. But none of its mass
ages ise to the “notes almost divine"
which the greatest epic in human ex—
pericnce manifestly calls for.

Mr. Peck and Miss MacDonald gave
this quartet as sympathetic and mov»
ing a performance as could be imag-
ined, and revealed its beauty with
fidelity. still it seems entirely for
eign to the drama which may have
inspired it in Mr. Burleigh's imag-
ination, but which somehow got lost
in transmission.
