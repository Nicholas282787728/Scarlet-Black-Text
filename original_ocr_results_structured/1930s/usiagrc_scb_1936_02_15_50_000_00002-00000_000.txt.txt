FORGET YOUR NURSERY DAYS,

One discordant note intrudes upon the celebration of the
welLdeserved victory over the Oklahoma Aggies last night,
and that is the loud, UNGALLED for BOOING of both cities
ials and players in which the crowd at recent Grinnell games
has been indulging

There is absolutely no justification for such action.
If it is the case of the officials’ judgment against that of the
emwd, there is no reason for the crowd. attempting to run
the game. The officials are in the best position to observe
closely what is going on, and they certainly are much more
qualified to do so than the average basketball fan who has
but the haziest of notions concerning the rules or what has
happened.

If it is booing directed at individal players, there is
likewise no justification. The case of the "riding" to which
the Oklahoma guard, Little, was subjected last night is o. blot
on the reputation of Grinnell as a sportsmanlike place... Why
the crowd‘ elected to pick on him is hard -to understand;
inasmuch as several other players were called more often.
for fouling; yet the crowd picked on him. There certainly
is no display of sportsmanship when the crowd gets to
“riding” a. visiting player. It smacks strongly of the

'lmlly” instinct.

,Glinnell has had and still has a reputation for sports-
manship but if this sort of tactics is allowed to continue, such
a reputation will not continue. There is no excuse for this
childish display of temper on the part of the crowd, and
certainly Ian audience composed- mainly of college students
should appreciate the value of good sportsmanship enough to
put into practice the rules of the game.

Quit booing decisions, and if your neighbor insists upon
doing it, tell him to shut up. Booing belongs to the nursery
days and not among the acts of college men and women.

Gates Lectures

Ended Thursday

Bad Weather Lowers Size
of Annual Conference

Because of bad weather condi-
tions which made traveling impas-
siblc, the attendance at the 22ml
annual Plymouth Fellowship conr
fel'ence and the Gates lectures held
here this week, was reduced to ap-
proximately 25. the lowest figure
In recent years.

Not; only were the delegates une
able to reach cI-Innell. but two of
the conference leaders were .pre-
vented from coming as well. The
Rev. Wilmer P. Johnston of Oak
Park, 111., and the Rev. Arthur
McLaughlin of Ames, two at the
leaders, were unable to attend the
meetings.

Dr. Johnston's place was taken
by the Rev. N. C. Dreier of Cedar
Rapids, and DI. McLaughlInIs by
Dr E, A, Steiner.

The fourth and fifth Gates leer
tures were delivered by Dr, George
A, Bum-Ick, pastor of the Madi-
son Avenue Presbyterian church
of New York City.

Fourth antes Lecture

"We must remake the church, It
Is the home of man as an upward-
looking creature, and you and 1
can make it an adventurous
church, a democratic church, a ser
viceablc church and a’ reverent
church,” These words were the
keynote of the fourth Gates lec-
ture, entitled “The Church and the
New Order." delivered in Herrick
chapel VVedlIosday evening by Dr
Buttrick.

'IAII Is not; well with the Church,"
he declared. He cherged that. the
church had succeeded In making
Christ merely conventional, and
that it had compromised with the
world. To prove this statement, he
cited the facts that the poor are
alienated from the modern church,
that the church Is the concern of
the middle class and the rich and

marks of a vital church as being

sage; a democratic spirit: a. high

I'ingly intricate and accurate, con-

period. In the front Is the hook»

Studied Homely Plants

The botsnIst studied mostly
homely plants, known to every-
one. Among the old-fashioned
spellings he used are cucumer, let—
tice, besne, turnep, peare, Ierusa—

the manifold activities of his own

Church in New York City.

“However,” the speaker declared,

answered the question of how the
moral sickness of man could be
overcome by saying that this could
be done by the voluntary pains of

hslIeves, “not a remote God, but
the God who walked the city
streets. But it Is almost sacrilege
to ‘trust In His redeeming hlood'
if we do not ‘try His works to do',"
the speaker said In conclusion.

Fifth Gates mmrc

“Do the prayers of a righteous
man have a powerful. effect? Can
an uprIght man do a great deal
with prayer If he tries?” These
were the questions with which Dr.
George A. Buttrick, pastor of the
Madison Avenue Presbyterian
church, New York, opened the fifth
and last In the serIes of Gates leer
lures [or this year. His topic was
"Prayer and the Changing World,”
The address was given Thursday
morning In Herrick chapel.

Answering these questlous, Dr.
Buttl‘ick said, ”A righteous man
can do a great deal with prayer If
he tries Prayer is a heavy pen-
anoe that we do for the world. We
should see men as Jesus saw them
from the cross and, tlying to he
righteous, pray for them, The
church of today will not recover

apostolate of prayer."

From Common Root

"We are joined together more
closely than leaves on a tree draw—
ing life from a common met; We

he further explained.

Dr. BIIttI-Ick pointed out that.
Is something
maudlin to most of us about a
grown man praying as though
seeking an escape, still Jesus, the
brave man of Calvary, coveung no
escape, prayed. Modern students

The primary , redemption, he
said, Is prayer guided and Illumi-
Hated in conduct, and conduct
guided and illuminated in prayer.
Further, Christianity Is an intellec-
tually respectable affair.

“To know oneself 3 created be—
ing, that Is the beginning of prey-
er.” he explained. There should be
no desire but to do His will; one
should not. ask what, this prayer
can be used for because prayer is
a friendship with God, and a
friendship cannot be used. “Pray-
er should use us," he added.

was not Christ's miracles that
