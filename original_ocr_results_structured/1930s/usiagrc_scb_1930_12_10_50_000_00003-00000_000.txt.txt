Students Hear
of New Russia

Mrs. Canard Speaks on Visit

Before Cosmopolitan
Club Tuesday

"One is suspected, nct respected, if
he wears fine clothes on the streets
of Moscow," said Mrs. Letitia M. Con»
nrd speaking on her impressions of
Russia obtained during a visit there
inst summer before the Cosmopolitan
club last night.

"The first thing one notices
is that it is a one class society
in every way.” The Russians are so
devoted to American scientific meth-
ods that they use them even along
social lines.

and seniors? .

enough to judge their cuts as well as
an instructor would.

Beth Borrmrd: I heartily nppmve of

students have reached such years of

Old you should know whether or not
you need to go to class.

Robert Cable: I think it would be
a good thing for juniors and seniors.
They know, or should know, what
they are in college for.

Helen Niles: That really isn't a, bad
idea. Aiter all, getting on education
is our problem. Why nut lei. us do it
this wayiwhen, and only when we
want to.

through the anti-religion museum,
that atheism is truly a religion en-
deavoring to cast out the supersti-
tions which have delayed the human
race for centuries.”
