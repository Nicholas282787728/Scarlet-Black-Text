freshmen Monday night, working on
passes, kicking, and blocking. Don
Kingery, diminutive quarterback,
who, at various times this season, has
been relied on for almost every type
of offensive threat. did a good job of
passing, while Ed Henningsen, who
did most of the kicking earlier in the
season, did a good job of piinting.
Gould Plays Guard

In the game against Haskell last
week Watt put Captain Howard
Gould at a guard position and gave
Sutton the tackle place. Gould made
an impressive showing both on de-
fensive, and pulling out of the line
to run interference, Abe Rosenhloom
may not be able to start this week
because of an injured shoulder. it is
also probable that Trumbull will stnrt
at the pivot position in place of
Meoter, especially after making a
good showing against the indians
last week.

The game will be played on Ward
field and is scheduled to start at 2
pm.

The probable starting lineup:
Gi-iunell Drake
Anderson Smith
Morgan it Cole
Gould lg Brechlcr
Trumbull r .lones
Safris rg Baker
Sutton rt McClure
McKee l'e Dcskin
Kingery qb Potts
Bradley lb Wieland
Bauer rb swan
Rose fb Gaer

Grinnell Ties
Haskell, 0 to 0

Although having a disadvantage in
first downs and in yardage gained
from scrimmage, the Grinnell college
football team managed to hold the
Haskell Institute eleven to a score-
less deadlock in the game played at

Lawrence, Kansl, Armistice Day.

Coach Watt’s men threatened the
host's goal line on several occasions,
and once in the second quarter man-
aged to work the hall to the 18 yard
line as a result of a 17 yard pass and
a long return of a punt by Kingeiy.
The Indians however, stopped this
rush and held the ball for the re
mainder of the half.

Haskell attempted 25 passes, coin-
pleting s and gaining 144 yards with
this method of offense, but alwaysl
lost the ball soon after gaining scor-
ing territory. In the first quill-tel"
the Haskell team staged a march
that ended on the five yard line at-
ter an incomplete pass over the goal
line.

D he took it on the chin his.
week when ii homecoming crowd of
10,000 people at stillu-atcr, okln-
homa rooted the Cowboys to a dc-
cisire 21-0 riotory,’ to throw a wet
blanket on the Bulldogs‘ Missouri
Valley title hopes. The Bulldogs

give the fiiiis some in ' ty with
error-in spectacular dashes “'9, hope
that our homecoming crowd will
have the some effect on our play-
ers.

When coaches and sports writers
begin the annual postseason selec-
tion of mythical teams, thcy are gar
ing- to have a hard time figuring out
the man to put at fullback position
for the Missouri Valley, even if Al
Rose and Ross (Plowhoy) Hall. of
the Oklahoma Aggies are the only
leading contenders, Hall weighs 184
pounds and has been raising havoc
all season with the Cowboy oppon-
ents. He is especially good on are
fense while Rose is one of the hard—
est hitting and best all-round defen-
sive fullbacks that has been seen in

 

the Missouri Valley this season. Hall
was recently given the fullback posi-
tion on an all-state Oklahoma teal-m
with rivals on such teams as Tulsa
and Oklahoma university, and was
given a similar honor on the state
team last year.

It probably settles down to a mat»
tor of which is more important to
a football team, good offensive, or
good defensive? From the results of
games in which 24 of the leading
teams in the country took part last
week, and in which at least one of
those teams failed to score, it zip-l
pears as though the latter is the
most important. At any rate we con-
sider that Rose should be given a
glance, and if we are asked to make
any selections, he will have his name
at fullback position, regardless of his
offensive abilities,

Plans Abandoned for Race
Between Halves of Game

Plans for a cross-country race to
be held between the halves of thev
Drakecrinnell homecoming game
have been abandoned because of un-
certain weather conditions and for
lack of a sufficient number of runs
ners, announced Joesph Pheilfei- ycse
tel-day.

The crossscountl‘y club will hold a
dinner in the dormitory dining room
this evening at 6:15 p m, and will
elect new officers afterward. All
awards won in cross-country meets
this year will be given out at this
meeting, and several important top-
ics will be discussed.
