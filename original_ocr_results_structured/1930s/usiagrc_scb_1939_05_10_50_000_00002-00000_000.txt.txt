THE QUOTA PLAN

The quota plan for the quadrangle has been
approved. But it passed by a margin of
scarcely fifty votes, and the opposition it
received was perhaps more vehement than
the approval of the majority.

Undoubtedly the new arrangement is
not a perfect one. Those supporting it, re—
cognizing that upperclass cottages have
been “typed” to some extent, have believed
this the best plan for equalizing them. It
has not seemed a good thing that one cot-
tage should house forty sophomores and
only a sprinkling of seniors, while in an-
other the seniors are heavily in the major-
ity; or that too many of the leaders on the
Women’s campus should be congregated on
the same floor. Neither has it seemed a good
thing that one cottage be recognized as
”social,” another as “intellectual," another
as “athletic,” and so on, Of course the ten-
dency toward such distinction is not very
strong. but the beginning of the tendency
exists undeniably.

The solution suggested is new and one
tried. Equalization according to classes may
not prove successful in combating the
“typing” of cottages at all, Perhaps, even,
cottages should be “typed" in order to iii-
sure a congenial atmosphere. ‘

The quota system may not prove satis-
factory. But it has been approved for next

year, and it is the business of quadrangle

residents to regard it with open minds and

a willingness to test it out. Otherwise it

will have failed before it has been tried.

THE ALL-MEN'S DINNER

Few of the affairs held this year have
caused as much favorable comment by the
men of Grinnell as the Young Men’s
Christian association all-men‘s dinner, The
large attendance, good food, well»planned
program, and appropriate entertainment all
combined to make the dinner enjoyable for
everyone, Short speeches by Dr. Norris, Mr,
Charlton, and Dean Beatty, and the main
speech by Bert N. Mills, secretary of the
Bankers Life Insurance Co. of Des Moines,
were all entertaining and instructive.
Having all the men of Grillnell, including
the administration, students, employees, fac-
ulty, and trustees together is an excellent
way of promoting and symbolizing that feel~
ing of unity and equality which is the es-
sence of the Grinncll spirit. Grinnell is

noted for this spirit of democracy, and'

what could serve better to keep it alive than
to have all the men of Grinnell from the
best professor down to the poorest student;
eat and enjoy themselves together on the
basis of equality and good fellowship?

A yearly dinner of this type would be-
come more and more valuable because it
would increase in significance as a larger
number of the men realized its value. It is'
our hope that future Y,M.C.A. cabinets will
continue to promote the Grinnell spirit by
making this dinner a yearly affair,

GEORGE LYMAN IIITTREDGE

To most people who know about him at all,
George Lyman Kittredge is a legend. They
have heard tales about his appearance, about
his enormous learning. about his wit, about
his ruthless treatment of undergraduates
They have probably heard too that he is the
most famous teacher of English in Ameri—
ca, famous because the kind of training he
advocated at Harvard has been for years
the ideal training for a college or univer-
sity professor to have, Actually he has been
one of the most influential teachers of any
subject because the men he trained went
out and in their own schools carried on the
Kittredge tradition.

Unfortunately, some of his disciples have
imitated his mannerisms, and part of the
legend is the impression abroad that he is
eccentric, Nothing could be farther from the
truth. Mr, Kittrcdge is almost a personifi-
cation of common sense. Perhaps no teach—
er has ever approached literature with more
sanity and at the same time with more
knowledge of the subject, >

Those who hear him Friday night will be
first of all impressed by his appearance.
He is a’striking person. They will probably
be struck next by his learning, Then they
will make the most remarkable discovery of
all: that the learning is important, not for
itself, but because it makes the study of
literature rich and- meaningful. They will
understand then a little of the Kittredge iii-
fluellce in American education.

German Demands

For Rig/its In

Corridor Upheld
I————By W.C.H.—

With colonel Beck’s reply to Hit-
ler’s demands [or Dauzig and
communication concessions in the
Polish corridor, Poland became
more than ever the current Euro-
pean jitters-spot,

in his speech or April as,
Hitler asked tor the return oi
naiizig to the Reich and a
German inotor route and rail-
road across the Corridor, pos-
sossing the same extra-territor-
ial rights as Poland enjoys, In
return he promised to recog-

nize all Polish rights in Dan-
zig, insure rolhnd a free har-
bor there, accept the present
boundaries between the two
countries, conclude a 25-year
non-aggression treaty with Po-
land, and guarantee the indee
pendencc of Slovakia by Gore
ninny, Poland, and Hungary
jointly.

As was expected. Joe Beck, Par
land’s foreign minister and No. 1
trouble-shooter, told Hitler that
he thought the demands a hit
one-sided and that Poland could-
n’t see her way clear to sur-
,rendering Danzig and the motor
and railway routes. However, the
Colonel made good and sure that
hc left the latch-string hanging
I out to future negotiations.

That Hitler’s demands were
as one-sided as the Polish gen-
tleman pictured them is ex-
cccdingly dubious. By any
standard oi judgment sane that
of Vengeance, Dnnzig is a Ger-
)nan city. It is German in back-

 

 

population. Developed by Ger—
many into a. great seaport, it
belonged to her until the re—
vengermatlllenell allies wrench—
ed it imm her in 1919 and
dumped it inio the lap of the
League of Nations, And now,

Furthermore, even it Poland
might be inconvenienced by her

controllcd Danzig, she can not
suffer too much, for she has de~
veloporl the rival port of Gdynia
as an alternate outlet for her Bol-
tic trade. As for Hitler's request
for a German controlled means or
conununication across the corri-
dor, that, too, is understandable.
From 1772 what is now the Polish
Corridor was German territory

OPEN FORUM

To the Editor of the
SCARLET AND BLACK:
Dear Mr. Adams:
The brilliant dissertation on
”Hitler, the Human" (Wednes-
day’s 5&3) called to mind the
April 19 issue of News Views.
Compare in these the ”amateur
‘diplcmacy" of our own President
to the “amazing man whose shear
force of personality has raised him
to master of 55,000,000 Germans.”
Hitler is just a man. So are
thousands of the same in concen—
tration camps. So are Cardinal
innitzer, Thomas Mann and Al-
bert Einstein, So are the members
of that great race whose real
wages have dropped 7 per cent in
the '32 to ’37 period since Hitler.
So are those whose antirwar de»
monstrations are clubbed down by
the Gestapo at Dusseldorf. So are
they alliProtestant, Catholic, Jew
ish, negro, Austrian, and Czecho-
Slovakianiwhose political and re-
ligious ideals do not conform to
the dogmas of the Third Reich.
Nonetheless, to friend commen-
tator, this Bonapcrtist hero under
whose guidance “a people have
come into their own“ merits, it
would seem, greater esteem than
our own “meddling Franklin” _—
otherwise known as “Jack Hor-
ner." Roosevelt’s message put the
finger on Fascists as the aggres-
sors against world peace and se-
cuxity, exposed their aims speci-
lically, and made it harder for the
Munichmen to plot again, This
appeal will go beyond Fascist
clouds to the peoples of those

nated it to Poland as an opening
on the sea.

The whole thing was an arti-
iioiai creation which split the
Germirn state in two, leaving
the important province at East
Prussia dangling on the other
side or a ioreign country. The
action may be justiﬁed on the
grounds that it was necessary
that Poiand have some outlet
to the sea, But it is equally
justifiable that Germany should
at least have a means of com-
municeuon under her control ior
reaching hex-dangling province.
