Fifty women from the dancing
classes in the physical education do-

dancing contest.

“Nadding Flowers" Effective

The festival opened with a number.
uNodding Flowers,” in which the in-
lterpl‘etation of sunflowers growing
at the garden wall was effectively
given. A scarf dance followed this.
and then the "Three Bold pirates"
hauled their ropes with vigor in the
following number. "Me and My Shad-
ow." a tap selection, and n Valentine
dance were well received.

An outstanding number was “Ex-
taste,” a natural dance. “Rondo Cap-
riccioso” and a Greek warrior dance
completed the first part of the pro-
gram.

“Crescent Moon" Original

Two women were included also.

"The Statue of Beauty." to which

which was assured by the appropiate
stage setting, the lighting effects.
and the incidental music provided by
Nadine Marquis and Eunice Cutler.
The overture from the “Nutcracker
Suite" (Tschalkowsky) was played
by an orchestra under the direction
of Chester Williams.

Story of Prince

The scene opens on a festival of
Russian villagers where amusing pan.
tomine is provided by the village
children. At the sound of the magic
pipes played by the “Child who loves
Beauty," the villagers stop their
frolic and listen to music of the spring
of eternal youth. of moonbeams, star-
light. and water nymphs. A moon-
beam dance behind a gauze curtain
gave an ethereal effect. while the
nymphs were gracefully portayed

Observatory Set
Time for Grinnell
at Goodnow Dome

That there once was an observa-
tory on the tower of Goodnow hall
is a fact unknown to many Grinnell
students. it was constructed in the
eighties during the time that s. J.
Buck served as professor of math «
matics and astronomy and it was dis-
mantled in 1907.

A movable dome covered the top
of the tower. and in this was an eight-
inch telescope. In Mr. Gale‘s room
may still be seen the two clocks
which once served as time keepers
for the whole town. These were built
at the Centennial exposition in Phila-
delphia, One of the clocks kept time
for the college and rang the bells.
The other kept time for the town and
even the railroad people.

The small house north of Goodnow
has excited much curiosity. This was
the transit house, and here was found
the instrument which told time by
means of the stars.

The Hughes and the Darrows of to-

and the Sprungs of tomorrow if the
great court battle of Monday night
is any indication. When the roost of

to our grandchildren how we went

lawyer of all time, and Sprung, Dor-
row-s only rival since the world be-
gan.

the men are dismissed for cause. The

ﬁnally selected, and they take their‘
places in the jury box, Judge Brad-
ford‘s speech to the jury over. the

It seems that Monday morning.‘
sometime about 3 am. the room of
John Wiley was entered by two prow-

plaintiff. On the witness stand he;
states that he can’t be sure of the‘
size of the man who attempted to
gain entrance through his window.

. Alexnlndel' Rescues

“Do you solemnly swear to tell the
truth. the wholetruthondnothingbut
thetruth—SohelptoGod-WHAT’S YOUR
NAME?" cries out Bailiff Letton.
and another witneﬁ takes the stand
to commit more perjury than the one
preceding. It is necessary in the cir-
cuit court of Gates hall if the case
is to be won.

Then Alexander continues the
cross questioning for the plaintifr.
helping his roommate. Henson. He
calls for a re-reading of the testimony
from the clerk of court. Cushman,
elder brother of the defendant. but
the plaintiff makes no objection.
Polachek continues for the defense—

tection.

Perjury Suspected l

The jury is restless but the al
goes on. “Silence in the courtroom!"
cries out the judge. Then the evidence
is presented. A pipe. a waste-paper
basket, a crumpled map. a threaten-

Then more witnesses are sworn in.

CEDAR RAPIDSmThe importance
of keeping news streams from Amer—
ica to Europe free from “polution”
was stressed by Hal-u. O’Flaherty,
resident foreign service editor of the
Chicago Daily News. who addressed
more than 90 delegates attending the
fifteenth annual convention of the
Iowa College Press association here
Friday,

The delegates are representatives of
13 Iowa colleges. members of the as-
sociation. Their Saturday program in-
cluded addresses by Roy Porter of the
Des Moines Register and Grant Mil-
nor Hyde. professor of journalism at
the University of Wisconsin.

Say ‘DcSe Guys'

Mr. O'Flahel‘ty addressed both the
morning and afternoon sessio'us and
in carrying home his point remarked
that the foreigners are getting an idea
from United states dispatches that
all Americans "tote guns and say
‘dcse guys’."

A plea for pertinent editorials and
less syndicated or “canned" views
was made by Herschel M. Colbert.
head of the department of journalism
at Grinnell college, who spoke to the
group yesterday. Professor Hyde
spoke at the convention banquet Fri-
day evening on "Opportunities in
Journalism."

Prosperous Smaller towns
"Journalism is getting prosperous,

especially in the smaller cities." he
said. The many openings for women
in journalistic work were stressed by
the lecturer.

Friday’s session was concluded by
informal dancing in the recreation
room of the men’s gymnasium at Coe
college. Nine Grinnell students are
attending the convention,

John Canning. Grinnell, 1930-31
president of the association. presided
at all meetings of the group.

 

Brand New Derby,

Bonnet Arrive

for Sigma Delta Drag Saturday

Francis Hawk Will Officiate
at Annual Razz Fest
in Men’s Gym

Prospective entries in the 1932
race for the coveted but nefarious
prize, one derby hat, brown in color.
and about seven and one-eighth in
size. will be gratified to learn that
only new products will be used in
making the awards this year.

In years past there have been
times when previous winners of col-
legiate awards, such as the derby.
the green gloves, the purple stock-
ings. or the kite have returned them
for presentation to the campus guess-
ers of the following year.

There have been several opinions
on the reason for the move this

 

spring. One group of theorists holds
that Ernie McIntire. recipient of the
1930 derby. ruined his prize when he
used it as a cushion on the way to
Omaha. others contend. however.
that Hat Hander Hawk. who will
make the awards this year. refuses
to give out second hand garments.

“If 1 must take up welfare work,"
remarked Mr. Hawk recently. “I'll do
it from the other end. If I had a used
hat. temptation might prove too great
and I could never hear to give it
away. With prizes that are brand
new, temptation will be lessened by
their unfamiliarity,"

The prizes are ready for the gala
evening, however. and those who will
receive them have already been
named. The names are still in secret,
and those who fear exposure at the
Drag may still act. A little paid pro-
tection in the right quarters might do
worlds of good. If you have a guilty
consciencc~think it over.
