Grinnell Doped
to Take Bears
in Track Meet

Distances to Give Pioneers

Margin in Scoring

of Dual Contest.

Frosh Meet Tutors

Yearling Stars Return to Squad
to Bolster Hopes for Will

Over State Teachers.

Both Grinnell track teams Will fill
out of town dual engagements this
week-end. The varsity squad will
journey to St. Louis for a meet with
Washington university, while the
freshmen will provide the opposition
for the State Teachers‘ yearlings at
Cedar Falls.

Varsity prospects are good and
the dope favors the Pioneers an an.
nex‘ another dual to make their red-
ord nine consecutive dual victories.
The little Pioneers should also win
their tussle, but they have proved to
be a temperamental outfit and may
fail to take events which should be
theirs. The State Teachers aggrega-
tion has only been in one meet this
year, that being a triangular affair
with Coo and Cornell, in which they
placed second. The local squad has
been greatly strengthened by the ad—
dition of Graflund and Bowlby. stell—
ar weight men, and Holmes, dash-
man, who have been ineligible so far
this season.

Tutors Have Vuulter

The Tutors' strongest events will
be thepole-vault and the quarter-
mile. Ridenour' has been Covering
the 440-yard event in :52.8. which is

- remarkable time for a freshman run-
ner. Grinnell's dash hopes, Alex.
render and Poiman, should take first

, and second places in the dashes, Pil-
brow looks good for a win in the
mile, Newsom points for a first in
the halt-mile, and James a victory in
the brodd~jump. .

The Washington dual will see some
classy individual baltlers, one of the
best of which should be the high
jump affair with Ben Douglas go-
ing against Weber, who copped the
conference indoor meet in that event.

Grinneu Has Edge

While Grinnell is given a slight
edge in the advance rating, the nice!
should prove closer than the Drake

' affair last week. Neither team
boasts any outstanding men in the
dashes and they should split these
points. The Bears will probably be
able to match the hurdling of Hen-
sley and bring in their share of the
points there.

The great majority of Washington
points will come in the field events.
however. The Bears are scheduled
to take the weight events, broad—
iump and pole-vault. Miller scales
thirteen feet regularly and Greene
has failed to come close to that
mark.

Distances Will Count

Grinnell on the other hand will
climb up in the point column with
the distance events. The quarter,
half, mile and two—mile, as well as
the mile-relay are scheduled on the

Ruth DetongEWins,
Women’s Net Title

Ruth DeLong defeated Lucille
Bauman, 6-3 6-2, in the final match
of the girls' fall tennis tournament
held Tuesday afternoon. Miss De-
Long, a freshman, has been promin-
ent in athletics all year, serving as
center on the freshman hockey team
and as captain of the freshman bas—
ketball squad. Miss Hauman, also a
freshman, played good strong tennis,
but Miss DeLong‘s fast drives and
speedy returns were too much for
her.

The match was featured by excit-
ing deuce games at the beginning
and at the end. Both of the girls
who took part in the match will re-
ceive one hundred W, A. A. points,
while Alberta Curtis and Marion
Brown, runners-up, will each receive
Seventy-five points. Drawings have
already been made for the spring
tournament and the matches will be
played off in the near future.

Lucille Robinson. golf champion
of Iowa, was the guest of Martha
age Hippee last week-end.

McIntire Awarded ‘Brown Derby’
for Hours of Study-Both of Them

“On with the dance, let joy he un-
reﬁned," and the dust and smoke
mingled among the rafters as the
mob shuffled over the surface of the
men's gymnasium ﬂoor at the sec-
ond annual Brown Derby Drag dance,
sponsored by Grinnell Sigma Delta
Chi, Saturday night.

Dick Phillips, master of cere-
monies, passed out the much coveted
awards. With the words: 't in the
fair name of lethargy and indolencs,
and in memory of those hours of
study, both of them, which you spent
at the library, I hang upon you the
Brown Darby," he made Ernest
Frank Mclntire knight of ye Brown
Derby, Ernie, whose bump of
ambition is only a dent,” easily won
this honor.

Littlc Flohill Hubbard, “great
grand-daughter of old mother Hub-
bard," received the brown bonnet,
the “female Brown Darby," as a re-
ward for being the woman who
created the greatest stir with the
least effort on the campus this year.

 

Eddie Brown, who has devoted his

college life to making Grinnell girls
happy, got the green gloves in re-
cognition of his smoothness, and
Marg Napier, "who has successfully
kept herself aloof from the Smith
hall boys and other common people
this year,” received the purple hose
for sophistication.

Kitty Gillespie was awarded the
“fragile wax flower of unsullied ins
noceuce" with the admonition that
“the innocent get their reward in
heaven, but others get theirs on
earth." Edward “GALAHAD” Allen,
one of the few remaining Crinnell
boys who takes food on his picnics,
received the lily as a reward for his
innocence and purity. His record
was marred only by his stooping to
the level of the right hand of fel-
lowship.

The kite went to Billie Milne,
"whose line is an endless chain," and
the leather medal—of course»went
to “our own dear Char-lie Parish,"
the home town boy who made good.
Charlie's claim to being the greatest
Mexican athlete ever produced was
absolutely uncontested.

Senior Class

Gives College
Memorial Gift

President Main to Receive
Annual Fund Formally

at Luncheon.

Pledges Voluntary

Twenty-Two Canvassers to Ask
Graduates to Contribute
to Endowment.

In keeping with the custom or
graduating classes, the class of 1930
is planning to establish a permanent
fund to be known as the “1930 Class
Fund." to be added to the endow—
ment income of the college.

According to Davis Greene and
Katherine Gillespie, financial chair-
men of the senior class, regular an-
nual contributions are to be solicited
trom each member. “If each one of
us will send in a. minimum of only
ten dollars a year the result to Crin-
nell will be the same as if 1930 had
given Grinnell an endowment fund
of tweuly~seven thousand dollars.
It‘s going to be some time before
any of us can send in twenty—seven
thousand dollars, but we can all chip
in ten dollars apiece per annum,"
says Greene. ‘

Twenty-Two Canuessers

Canvassers are now being selected
by the chairmen, to the number of
twenty-two. so that each canvasser
will have only six people to see. The
week beginning May 18 has been
named as the time for taking the
pledges. The pledges are voluntary
and bear no interest, and are revoc-
able if necessary.

The ﬁrst payment will not be due
until March 1, 1931, nearly a'year
from now, Pledges may vary in
amount, said Greene, and it. is ex-
pected that a good many will pledge
fifteen or twenty dollars to make up
for those who will not be able to give
so much perhaps. In the past few
years there have been individual con-
tributions as high as two hundred
dollars from members of graduating
classes.

Seniors Pledged Last Year

The fund will be formally offered
to Pres. J. H. T. Main in behalf of
the class at the commencement lun-
,cheon June 9, at which all the newly-
graduated “alumni" of 1930 will be
guests of the college.

The 1929 seniors also followed this
policy, each member of the class
signing a, pledge to give money to
the college.

The commencement luncheon at
Which the fund is to be offered, is to
be the official welcoming of the Seni—
ors into the alumni body. Dr.
Charles Clayton Morrison of Chicago
will deliver the commencement ad—
dress that morning and at the ion—
cheon some member of the alumni
Will Welcome the new graduates. A
member of the graduating class, a
daughter of the man making the
welcoming address, will respond. The
luncheon will be one of the last at-
fairs of the commencement program.
