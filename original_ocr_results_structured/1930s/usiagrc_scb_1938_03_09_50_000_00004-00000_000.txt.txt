FORGOTTEN “WAIF”

The setup under which the Grinncll band
has gradually becolne the cast off and folu
gotten ”waif" of the campus organizations
is at last due for investigation by a com,
mittee of the Student Council.

There is plenty to investigate. There will
be many unpleasallt facts revealed. May
we suggest just a few.

Why should the band be placed under the
control ol’ the athletic department“!

Why do we have a band without enough
uniforms to go around"?

Wily is our band so small that we are
ashamed to have it appear on tile football
field?

Why was physical education credit Sub~
stituted for scholastic cledit for participa—
tion in the band?

Shall we tell yoll the answers?

It isn't because the band lacks capable
leadership. Nor is it because there are not
enough musicians on the campus.

It is because the balld has been forgotten
by the administration and by the students
It is because the band, like every organi»
zation, needs money to buy uniforms, logical
incentives to attract players; needs the
backing of the department of music.

It is, in short, because the band, to be

successful, must be established in a posi-
tioll of prestige#a position in which, to
be a member of the band, will be compar—
able to being a member of the football,
basketball or track tealn, or of thc glee
club, etc.

This must be done, and should be done.
not only for the sake of the band, but for
the sake of Grinncll. A good college band
is equally as important as a good football
team ill building the prestige of the school.
if there are ally who doubt that statement,
let them look at other schools.

May we suggest to the committee of the
Student Council, which is to investigate the
possibilities of reorganization, that you ace
cept no half-way measures

May we suggest that you strive for re—
moval of the band from the department of
athletics to the department of music where
it belongs; that you work toward the sub,
stitution of an hour's music cledit, which
is earned, in place of the present credit in
physical education, as compensation for
service in the organization; that you make
definite arrangements for a fund from
which the balld could be supplied with
enough uniforms to make a real showing
for Grillncll.

The present members of the band are
not ill the organization for these benefits;

for, if they were, they would have dropped
out long since. They will, however, work
with‘ renewed spirit if these changes are
made.

Their showing at basketball games this
season is sufficient proof that not all the
present members of the band are in it for
physical education credit, but rather be-
cause they believe, dcspite the obstacles in
their way, that a good band is an asset
to the college and that they can perform
a real service to the college by their par—
ticipation in the band. \

We have no quarrel with the present
band; rather, we have a deep admiration
of the results they have achieved, despite
difficulties. What we do want is to give
the band the opportunity to really shine
as a Grinnell college musical organization
should shine.

JUST SHOW US!

Friday morning a group of students, the
chapel committee from Central college at
Fella, will come here to lead our chapel
program.

Now, down at Central, they have a sys-
tem of compulsory chapel attendance, so
that when, several weeks ago, a group of
Grillncll students went down there to lead
a chapel service, they talked to a full house.

Despite the fact that our chapel services
are not always well attended, we like to
believe that our voluntary system is better,
in many ways, than a compulsory one. We
will probably not be disillusioned too much
if there is not a capacity attendance at
chapel Friday. ‘

However that may be, we think Friday
will be an awfully good day for everybody
to go to chapel. If for no other reason than
to prove we're right about voluntary chapel.

Incidentally, we hear these Central men
are interesting.

ONE PLAY OR TWO

Now that the department of drama has
successfully completed the presentation of
“Alldrocles and the Lion," it is perhaps
worthwhile to point out a few pertinent
factors relating to the perenial question of
one large or two smaller plays.

There are numerous opinions on this
question, but few of those, who will glibly
discuss the situation, are cognizant of the
actual conditions involved.

The fact is, that such a play as “An—
drocles," requiring considerable expendi-
ture for costumes, scenery and the like, can
not be presented on two per cent of the
student activities fee alloted the depart-
lnent of drama without a financial loss to
the department.

0n the other hand, it is possible, with
the aid of a small admission fee, to present
two modern costume plays with simple
scenery on the allotted amount,

The question is one of degree of diffi-
culty and amount of entertainment. The
answer is up to the student body. Do you
want one play or two? i

ACT WITHOUT FEAT .

(Reprinted From The Daily O’Collegian)

Justice is oftentimes not done because the
person charged with administering justice
lacks courage to act. Sitvdown strikes, from
which the country suffered last summer,
were declared illegal by the courts. Yet
governors hesitated to call the national
guard to free factories from sitedowners.
If at the first outbreak of this form of
labor coercion, the governor would have
consulted with plant managers, telling them
they liskcd having their machinery
smashed by workmen enraged by tear gas,
and getting their possession to proceed with
the national guard, there would have been
but one sitrdown strike. This is a harsh
method but our sympathy is with labor
only so long as it is in the right and uses
legal methods to gain its ends.

Sit—downers continued like a spoiled baby,
to sit when it should be jerked up and
spanked.

 

Two sets of colored reproducA
tions of famous pictures, received
recently as gifts to the college,
are on exhibit on the first floor
of the Administration building,
Miss Edith A. Sternfeld, assistant
professor of art, announced today.

The two sets, which will be ex-
hibited throughout next week, are
the gifts of Sara Rossman ‘35,
and or the National Committee
for An Appreciation of which
Pres. John s. Noilen is a. sponsor.

One set consists of eight prints
of paintings in the collection
which Andrew Mellon gave to the
nation last year,

The second set consists of 48
color prints of famous paintings
from the time of the lLulian Ren-
aissance to the present. It forms
part of a. new project of the com-
mitttee for bringing art within
the reach of people of moderate
means at a low cost, Miss Stern-
{old said.

The 48 prints will be exhibited
in the art studio from March 9
through 16, and may be viewed
on week days from 4:30 to 5:30
p. m. and all day Saturday, Miss
Slernfeid explained.

Both sets have been mounted
and will be added to the collection
of color prints in the college li-
brary.
