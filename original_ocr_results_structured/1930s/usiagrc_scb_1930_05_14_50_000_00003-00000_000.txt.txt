hesitating comeback, Helen im-

Drake in Tennis

Jones, Allen Only Pioneers
to Lose in 4-2 Match
Here Monday.

An unexpected victory in second
singles, when John Kent triumphed
over Captain Everett of Drake, gave
the Grinnell tennis team the edge on
a 4-2 victory over the Bulldogs in a
return match here Monday after-
noon. The first of the series which
was played in Des Moines resulted
in a 3-3 tie. Other Crinnell wins
came from Robert DeLong's victory
over Modeer, and sensational tri-
umphs in both doubles matches.

PlayingJistless tennis, Capt. Don
Jones gave way to the steady strok-
ing of Frank Brody, Drake's num-
her one man, 8-6, 6-4. With the score
in games five to two against him in
the second set, the Pioneer ace pull-
ed up to within one game of the
visitor, but failed to prevent Brody
from taking the set and match.

Kent, playing his best tennis this
year, came through with a surprise
tally for the home team when he
pounded out a well earned victory
over Everett of Drake, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3.
Kent displayed a steady backhand
and his line placements and play to
the- baseline kept Everett away from
the net where he is so effective.

Robert_DeLong turned in a credit-
able victory when he defeated the
hard-hitting Modeer, 6-2, 5-0. De-
Long has proved the most consistent
singles winner on the Pioneer team,
having turned in five wins so far
this season, The fourth singles re-
sulted in a complete route for the
Drake wielder, winning from Ed
Alien with the loss of only three
games.

Jones and Kent gained sweet re-
venge when they outplayed the vet-
teran Drake doubles combination of
Brady and Everett to win, 3-6, 6-4,
6-3. The Bulldog first string duo de-
feated Jones and Kent on the Des
Moines courts. All four players
were in great form and their numer-
ous rallies brought repeated applause
from the spectators. The stellar net
play of Kent featured in the Pioneer
win.

In second doubles, Robert and

Charles DeLong found little opposi-
tion in the first set, taking it 6-3.
However, the second and third sets
were of a different nature and the
Pioneer duo won, but only after the
hardest sort of a struggle.
The second set was a twenty-five
game affair, and by taking it 13-11,
the Bulldog pair evened up the count
in sets. With the count 3-1 against
them in the third set, the Pioneer
team rallied to even the score at 3-3,
dropped the next game, and then
reeled off the next three games to
win 6-4. Robert DeLcng‘s net work
and Charles DeLong’s cannonball
service were most effective.

Talk Monday

Prof. J. W. Ghnnaway Gives
Address to Graduates
at Hospital.

"The supreme problem of the pre-
sent generation is to learn how to
socialize the individual and make him
fit into our social lite," said Prof.
John W. Gannaway, head of the pol-
itical science department at Grin-
nell college, in his address at
the commencement exercises of the
Community hospital Monday, when
five graduates of the training school
received diplomas.

“Democracy is no longer an indi-
vidual democracy," said Professor
Gannaway. "it is a social democracy.
Diseases are not conﬁned to the in-
dividual, they are a great big vital
social problem, and we must give our
support to any movement to better
social conditions. If we have the
concert of social democracy we will
realize that only in the improvement
of the community does the individual

come into the highest personal de-
veiopment."

“We are all interested in health
problems," said the speaker, who went
on to show extent of health prob-
lems. “Health is associated with
poverty, unemployment, old age,
child labor, hours of labor, accidents,
minimum wage, alcoholism, housing
conditions, war, education, etc. Life
is becoming constantly more ‘ccm-
plex, and restrictions are being plac-
ed more and more on us as popula-
tion grows,” said Prof. Grannaway.
who cited the few health problems
that the founders of America had to

deal with.
The graduates were: Mary Ohland,

Genevieve Vahrenwald, Laura B.
Chapman, E, Margaret Sears, and
Mable E. Bloom.
