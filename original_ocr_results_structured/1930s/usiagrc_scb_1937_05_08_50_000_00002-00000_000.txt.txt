HATS OFF TO OMAHA PRESBYTERIANS

It is witll great satisfaction tllat we note the recent
election of the Rev. John Simeon Williams as moderator over
10,000 Nebraska Presbyterians. His is the only Negro con—
, 'egation in the presbytery, Every year each of the 289
presbyteries of the Presbyterian church elects a moderator
to be its presiding officer. The Rev. Mr. Williams is the c—
ond man of his race ever to become a moderator, the f 'st
being the Rev. Charles Trusty of the Pittsburgh presbytery
in 1928, He is a native of Jamaaci, British West Indies,
and has been pastor of his Omaha congregation of 57 for
seven years. The racial question in America is far from set-
tled and one of the most hindering things in regard to the
settlement is the general apathy of the people, especially in
the north, toward the matte Certainly this action by a
church is a step in the right direction and may be well noted
by other groups, religious and non-religious throughout the

nation,
bytel‘y is to be congratulated

The Presbyterian church through the Omaha pres-

on its modern, democratic ac—

tion which becomes even more significant when it is re-
membered that Omaha was the scene of a serious racial dis-

turbance in 1919.

Critic Finds Shawn’s Men Dancers
'Enthusiastically Received

“Aesthetic" Program Free
From Customary
Silliness

By HENRY ALDEN

A large audience tilled the high
school auditorium last night to see
Ted Shawn and his ensemble of
men dancer's. Their enthusiastic
response eloquently expressed ape
proval of Shawn's attemptifor the
most part successfu'lito ire-estab-
lish the dance as a. manly art.

Despite occasional lapses as in
“The Dance of the Redeemed,"
the program was singularly free
from the la-de-da silliness gener
ally associated with “aesthetic”
dancing. Ranging from dances
based on primitive indian rhythms
to modernistic patterns inspired
by the machine, the performance
was most impressive when it was
most active and gymnastic, as in
the "Ponce. Indian Dance" and
the “Dance of the Dynamo.” There
was a tendency to exaggerate the
story element in some of the num—
bers; the result was a. distortion of
the dance form similar to the ole-
generation suffered by music in
“program" pieces of too obvious at
nature. For that reason, this
critic preferred the “pure” ab-
stract dancing in the “Kinetic
Molpai" and the “Dance of the
Dynamo” to the more representa-
tional pantomime of the “Eagle
Dance” and the “Study of St.
Francis of Assisi."

Although on the whole it sugr
gested rather a constantly shifting
and dramatic series of tableaux
than the art of the dance as it is
practiced by the Russian ballet
and the disciples of the school of
Mary Wigman, the ensemble danc-
ing was impressive and competent-

z:
ly done. or Ted Shawn’s solos, the
most popular was the sensuous
and amusing "Danza AfrorCu-
bana." "Cutting the Sugar Cane,”
a dance with a labor theme and a
similar Cuban inspiration, was one
of the most rhythmically pleasing
numbers and was made memorable
by the dancing of Barton Mumaw,
Tc Barton Mumaw go the real
honors of the evening, not only be-
cause of his expert solo work in
the primitive “Dyak Spear Dance"
and the more conventional “Pier-
rot” number, but also because a
remarkable precision and what
seemed an intuitive grace distin-
guished him from his fellows in all
the groups in which he appeared.
One felt that he was a master not
only of the technique characteris—
tic of the Shawn school but also
of the traditional skills of the
pallet, and that this training lent
authority and beauty to his every
movement.

It was perhaps unfortunate
that the last group of “Religious
Dances" should be as a whole the
least interesting of the four (1in
sions of the program, but that fact
did not materially lessen the audi-
ence‘s enjoyment of a colorful
and exciting program. The Wom-
en‘s Social Budget and the Council
of House Presidents are to be
commended for bringing the
Shawn dancers to Grinnel],

DORIC

Comes the time when we write
our last Doric and hand the torch
to our successor, hoping it is
burning as brightly as when we
took it We have always promised
ourselves that our last effort would
be a red hot denunciation of the
things that have gi-iped us, but
the sun has come out of retires
merit and we feel too mellow to be
really nasty. .

During our term of oiiice
we have caused three womcn
on the shift oi the college
sonic minoyimcc because oi
remarks in this column. May
we apologize at this time and
hope that thc slate is clean,

We beg to announce that we
still consider thc food at Grinnell
somewhat of a problem, It is
our desire that our successor take
this matter under consideration
and when a. lunch of beans, veger
table soup, carrots, and spinach
is served to champion the rights of
the common people.

The prctcusc at student sclfr
government is another mnttci-
(hut dcscri-cs the constant at
teiitiou or the Doric editor.
The ioiblcs nun follies of our
governors make excellent
copy.

The love life of the campus is
strictly Doric material and any
encroachment upon this field
should be highly resented by the
incoming editor. Doric should of-
fer advice as to weather condi-
tions and likely picnic spots as
well as publicizing the bundling of
obnoxious couples.
