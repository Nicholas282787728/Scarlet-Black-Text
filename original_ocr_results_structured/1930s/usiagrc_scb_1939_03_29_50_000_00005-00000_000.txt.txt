Lhdies' course are omitted from

of the early college fathers, or to
the difficulty of computing the
correct poundage of a young lady,
after making proper deductions
for wearing apparel.

Women Less notioent.

In the matter of age, however,
women of that era seem to be
less reticent. The average age for
students enrolled in the Ladies
course is 13,32 years, while the
Ladies- preparatory course has an
average of 19.28 years, an uncle
plainable discrepancy, since the
preparatory course is the equiva
lent of the high school course of
today.

The men measure up to present
standards, their average ages be
ing: college department, 20.45;
Preparatory, 18.97; and English
and Normal, 19.15.

Solve ‘Sociztl Problem.’

That times do not change is at-

 

the list, due no doubt to chivalry'

 

The average weight of men students enrolled in Iowa college during
1869770 was 149.75 pounds, according to figures published in the catae
lop, for that 3eal'7undel' the heading “Vital Statistics."

Preparatory students, and those enrolled in the English and Nor-
mal departments, had an average weight of only 143.03 and 141.44
pounds respectively, but weights;

tested by the fact that the fol-
lowing is included in a section of
the catalog entitled “Laws.”

“Damage done to college buildings .

or property during any one term,
if not traceable to the perpetra-
tors of the same, and if the occu-
pants cannot he justly held liable,
shall be assessed on the whole
number of students at the close
of each term.

Occupants of rooms shall not
use alcoholic fluids for light, or
remove from one room to another,
or take down any stove, without
permission.”

The social problem was solved
as follows; “Young gentlemen
will he allowed to visit young la-
dies connected with the college
only during the vacation of study
hours on Satui‘dav afternoon, ex—
cept by special permission of
the faculty." study hours were
designated as follows: “from s to
12 a. m., and from 1 to 4 and
onerhalf, and from 7 to 9 p. m."
