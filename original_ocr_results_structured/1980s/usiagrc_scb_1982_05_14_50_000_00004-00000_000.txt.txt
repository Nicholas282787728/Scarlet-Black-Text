hundred more, Many orw'

these victims are gollers.

It‘s not usually the profes
sional sportsman who is the
victim, says the National
Weather Service or the us.
Department of Commerce.
The average recreational

golfer, who is not aware oi
the. hazard, is much more
likely to be the one whose
life is in danger.

you're in the middle or
play” You're taking a
chance if you keep on play-
ing or stay where you are
and wait lot it to pass. The
only smart thing to do is to
get off the course and take
shelter in the clubhouse as
last as you canl
