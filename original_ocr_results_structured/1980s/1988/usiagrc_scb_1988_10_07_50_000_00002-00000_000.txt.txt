know the candidates _. local and
State as well as Presidential canr

Pare’nts'

One of the critical issues that
Koesler hopes will be discussed
is school funding. According to
her. ther are two legislative
committees studying the financ-
ing of public education. The
outcome of this study will have
"a signiﬁcant impact on all pri-
vate colleges in Iowa."

Koester explained that the
League of Women Voters helps
voters to become informed about
issues: "We are non-partisan.
We support no candidates or par
ties. We try to help everybody
get to know everybody. We
work on issues. not party poli-
tics."

Koester reminds the college
students that Oct. 24 is the last
day that they can register by

postcard before break if they want -

to vote here in Grinnell. "If they
do not do it here. they need to

pick up an absentee ballot while
at home."
