To the editor:

Cheap shot, Mike. Your
bit about the grape initiative is
utterly tasteless. Bitterness will
not change the fact that the over-
whelming majority of this camv
pus understands a moral principle
that you completely fail to grasp.
It is wrong for any person to put
his/her temporary gratification
above the survival of another
person. Despite your clever one»
liners, Dinning Services has as-
sured me that there will be
progress on this issue. Case
closed.

In regards to abortion, I
could not disagree with you
more. Where does life begin,
Mr. Kent? Apparently you be
lieve it begins before the end of
the first trimester. Exactly
when? Does it begin at the mo-
ment of conception, or even be—
fore? Perhaps the use of a con-
dom should be outlawed as con
slituting unjustifiable imprison-
ment? Is foam to be considered a
murder weapon? Admittedly.
these are ridiculous cxamplcs.
My point is that human life is
not to be defined on the basis of a
few cells. The fetus does not
think, and to the best of our
knowledge it docs not even feel
pain. For most of the pregnancy
it is decidedly not human. Life
does not begin at exactly the end
of the third month. The fetus is

   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

   
  
  

party involved. The mother is,
without a doubt, human. It is
cruel in the extreme to regulate
her life and her body. An un~
wanted child constitutes a life-
long punishment on the mother,
the child and anyone around
them. Mr. Kent, I doubt very
much that you have ever had oc-
casion to venture outside your
comfortable, little world. Our
society forces people to 1ch in

very unjust ways. Poverty is not
pleasant. Nor is living in a fam»
ily without love. Adoption is
not a viable option unless the fe»
tus is born a healthy, white, inv
fant. After birth, the humanity
of the child cannot be questioned.
You have the nerve to enforce a
horrible life on an innocent baby,
and then to turn around and claim
to bc a humanitarian. I am
disgusted Corey Hardin

agrees with pro-life views

To the Editor:

A special "thank you" to
Mike Kent regarding last week's
column. He should know that he
is NOT alone and there are other
pro-choice people around. I feel
just as strongly as he does, and it
was a wonderful feeling to have
my faith in humanity restored
once again! However, I, too, can
see the growth of the "I hate
Mike Kcnt" coalition. I cannot
defend him on every issue. bull
think that those who claim to bc
humanitarians AND pIOAChDICUS
should remember that abortion is
perhaps one of the most selfish
acts a woman can perform. En-

dent -- but two wrongs do not
make a right. We simply cannot
fight for equal opportunity if we
don't give EVERY person. born
or unborn, the chance to live at
the very least. I really do not
wrtnl to persecute others for their
beliefs, but I think everyone
should consider who is at the true
heart of the issue; it is not the
father, it is not [he government,
it isn't even the mother -- it is

To the Editor:

As wly as 1968, students
at Grinnell College have exr
pressed their abhorrcnce for the
racist government in the Repub-
lic of South Africa. Active sup-
port for the antirapartheid move;
ment, for the most part, took the
form of student participation in
the divestment movement.

In 1985, Grinnell College
adopted a partial divestment pol-
icy which stated: "Grinncll Col»
lcgc shall only invest in compa-
nies which have signed the
Sullivan Accords and are
independently evaluated as being
in compliance with such Princi~
pics. Furthermore, Grinnell
College shall not invest in com—
panies which are providing
strategic or technological support
for the implementation of
apartheid by the Republic of
South Africa." After work was
done under the 1985 resolution,
the effectiveness and validity of
this policy was called into qucs~

 

The life created may be, in
every sense of the word, an acci-

lion.

First, by basing investment
decisions on a corporation's Sul—
livun ratings, Grinnell was im—
plicitly condoning superficial rer
form of a nonrcformable and
racist social structure. Second,
the 1985 resolution cited no pre-
cise deﬁnition of "strategic and
technological involvement,"
making an evaluation of a condo
ration based on this stande im-
possible.

This year, a new resolution
which addressed some of the
many flaws in the I985 rcsolu~
tion was presented by Students to
End Apartheid and passed by the
Board of Trustees. Under this
policy the proportion of the
portfolio under direct control of
the Board, approximately one
third of the entire portfolio, will
be invested Soulll Africa-free. A
South Africa-free investment
policy entails not investing in
any corporation doing business in

or with the Republic of South
Africa. A corporation is doing
business in South Africa if "it.
its parent, or its subsidiaries have
direct investments in South
Africa, or have entered into [law
cllisc, licensing or management
agreements with or for any anity
in those countries. The list of
corporations affected by this
resolution will be determined by
information made available by
the Investor Responsibility Re-
search Ccnlcr, Inc,"

The remaining two thirds
of the portfolio, unaffected by
this policy, are controlled by
outside investment managers.
The decision to exclude that pro-
portion of the portfolio was based
concerns regarding the trustees‘
fiduciary responsibility. The
trustees feared that the imposition
of restrictions on Grinnell‘s in»
