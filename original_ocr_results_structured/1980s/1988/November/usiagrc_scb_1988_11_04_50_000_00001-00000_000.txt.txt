Trustees vote for South African divestment

by Kim Eckart

The Grinnell College Board
of Trustees approved a resolution
to divest college securities in
companies conducting business
with South Africa. The resolu-
tion, based on recommendations
from Students to End Apartheid.
is an amendment to a 1985 deci-
sion and will make the trustee-
controlled portion of college in-
vestments South Africairee.

The trustees also approved
a proposal to establish six addi-
tional full scholarships for black
South African students. three at-
tending Grinnell College, and
three attending selected South
African universities through the
Open Society Scholars Fund.

The trustees, in accordance
with investment counselors, will
divest the one-third of the college
portfolio controlled by the Board.
The other two-thirds of the in»
vestments are managed by the
Investor Responsibilty Research
Center, Inc. This divestment
process will occur over a ﬁve
year period.

According to SEA Presi-
dent Shannon Kelly, students
have been pushing for similar di-
vestment resolutions for 19
years. In November 1932. SEA
urged trustees to call upon
corporations in which the college
held shares to sign the Sullivan
Accords and cease activities
which support Apartheid. The
1985 resolution involved the

trustees‘ decision not to invest in
corporations which did not com-
ply with the Sullivan Accords or
provided the South African gov-
ernment with any support.

Friday's SEA rally empha-
sized the symbolic and moral
reasons for Grinnell College di-
vestment. According to Carol
Pilgrim, this type of divestment
is unusual: it is one of few reso-
lutions addressing the issue of
comprehensive divestment. Tra-
ditional divestment involves the
party's selling of its stock in a
South Africa-related company,
but often the company will set
up franchises in South Africa,
maintaining its business dealings
under another name.

One student at the rally
argued that America's investment
is against American values and
the values of Grinnell College.
"We show through divestment
that we are not living off the op-
pression of other people." said
the student, a member of SEA.

There is a trend among
other nations to divest, and since
this trend has begun, no new
companies have invested in
South Africa, Pilgrim said.

President George Drake
agrees with the trustees' decision.
"Along with our successful pro-
gram to provide scholarships for
black South African students,

lishing a South Africa-free policy
[or u'ustee-conu’olled investments
expresses our profound disagree-
ment with the Apartheid policy
of the government of South
Africa," Drake said.

Although SEA recognizes
that Grinnell College‘s divest-
ment will not end Apartheid, said
Kelly, they will continue to
strive for further actions on the
part of the college. "We will

continue to pursue the other two-
thirds

We still have a lot to do,
but this is a big step. We're
happy with the trustees' deci-
sion," Kelly said:

Administration prepares
for ARH renoyation

by Caryn Plait

Next year's renovation of
ARI-l is raising questions about
space for classrooms and faculty
ofﬁces Administrators propose
using dorm lounges, the Forum.

a ‘ Goodnow Hall, and several off-

campus houses to compensate for
the lost space.

When it was originally
built. ARH was designed for
strictly lecture classes. However,
Grinnell classes are changing and

’ emphasizing student participa~

tion. Because of this, ARI-l no
longer matches the design of
other, newer buildings on cam-
pus. The Grinncll Administra-
tion maintains that it is doing it's
best to bring the buildings on
campus up to the level of build-
ings at other higher education tn—
stitutions.
