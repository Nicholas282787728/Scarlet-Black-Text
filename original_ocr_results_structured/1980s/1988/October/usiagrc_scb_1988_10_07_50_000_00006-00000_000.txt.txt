‘—Letter Policy——

Letters to the editor are a very important aspect of our
newspaper. However, there are ground rules which must be
followed to ensure that letters are in the best interests of all
parties concerned.

We encourage letters and will print them intact as soon as
time and space permit. Letters in poor taste, judged to be
libelous or not following the guidelines will not be published.

Letters must be signed when they are submitted for
publication. Names will be withheld upon request only in
very rare instances. If it is clear that printing a name will
jeopardize someone's employment or personal wellrbeing, then
they will be withheld. We will print an anonymous letter
only after consulting with the author.

The deadline for letters is midnight the Tuesday before
publication. Letters must be submitted either via the Vax
system (tell Scarlet) or through campus mail (typed).

Student laments
second theft of bike

To the Editor:

Yes, this is another letter
concerning bicycle theft on came
pus. Sometimes people just need
to be told things twicet

I'd like to address this letter to
the person or people who stole
my bike (again!) from outside
Read Hall Sunday night -- as well
as to any person on this campus
who has ever taken a bike (or
anything for that mattcr) that did
not belong to him/her without
permission

Who on earth do you think
yDuarc'?”

When I was growing up my
parents taught me that I should
share my belongings with others.
I was also taught that I could
only borrow objects from others
if they gave me their explicit
consent after I asked. My parents
also taught me that taking an

object not belonging to me
without the permission of the
owner was called "stealing" and
that stealing was a punishable
offense. They demonstrated this
fact by severely punishing me for
any and all minor childhood
thievery. As a result of their
teaching, I have developed a set
of beliefs and values among
which is the belief that stealing
is WRONG! Also, I am of the
notion that when one steals be-
yond the age of 12 or 13 the
punishment is NOT just a slap
on the wrist. In fact, at the age
of most Grinnell students the
punishment is jail.

Is this notion of mine out of
date? Have I been so buricd in
my studies that someone changed

SCARLET AND BLACK

October 7, 1988

Fields defends cartoon
on harassment forum

To the Editor:

Judging by the negative re-
sponses to the editorial drawing
which appeared in the Sept. 23
issue of the Scarlet and Black, I
believe it is fair to assume that
those who criticized it did not
fully appreciate the artistic and
analytical skills which were dis-
played. Well, unfortunately, or
maybe accordingly, I did not ap-
preciate the analytical skills dis-
played in your criticisms of my
drawing. The inaccuracies which
have spawned forth from your
crit isms of my analysis terribly
manipulate and distort the pur-
pose of the drawing. To avoid
further confusion I will, for the
moment, retire my charcoal pen-
cil, and instead enlist the services
of my ball point pen.

In the two criticisms printed
in the Sept. 30 issue of the
Scarlet and Black, you write of "a
bunch of bitchy women known
as the Grinnell College Women's
Group," of "a great misundcr~
standing about (your) attempt to
fight harassment," of "the car-
toonist (feeling) that harassment
on this campus is a trivial sub-
ject," of people (specifically this
cartoonist) who attended the open
forum who ”did not LISTEN to
what (you) were saying," and of
"the disservice it does us all to
trivialize these issues in any
way" Upon repeated re-examina-
Lion of the controversial drawing,
the origin of these conclusions
still remains a mystery to this
"cartoonist".

Nowhere in my drawing is
there a mention of "a bunch of
bitchy womcn". You can choose
to refer to yourselves in any
manner you like, but do not
blame me for your self-degrading
nomenclature. I purposefully rer
framed from making such charac—

questions
printing of
PSN letters

To the editor:

Okay, this PSN group has
had letters in the past couple 5
and B5. Are you going to print
one every week? The reason I am
asking is those letters seem more
like advertisements for the group
than the opinion of an individual.
If you tliinl: the PSN is 0 inter-
esting. do a story on the . Buti
don't think it is necessary to prtttt
every lctier they scnrl you -- let
them put their mcss ge in the
memo and on posters l e other
campus organizations do. Todd

Ierjudgments, but if I were forced
to do so, I would prefer to use the
phrase "purposefully angry". It
is much less coarse and much
more appropriate. In fact, it was
the anger of many of the females
who posed questions to Dean
Crady and Officers Boyer and
Bush which prompted me to crit
icize your method. It was not the
actual anger of these women
which encouraged me to submit
my drawing to the Scarlet and
Black, but instead. it was the
persons at whom they directed
their anger.

Throughout the open forum,
different persons stressed repeat-
edly that neither rape nor harass-
ment can be blamed on the vic-
tim. I agree with this statement.
It is true. But does this mean
that rape and harassment can be
blamed on the police or the
deans? I truly hope, and believe,
that this is not popular belief.
but it does remain a fact that on
Monday, Sept. 19 a great deal of
anger was directed at the dean and
the two police officers. And why
7!? Because they cared enough to
participate in the open forum 7!?
This. my dear cartoon analysts,l
do not understand.

And as for my
"misunderstanding" your efforts
to eliminate harassment and my
"trivializing" the issue of ha-
rassment: I really don't think so.
Is it not possible that you mis-
understood my criticism of the
behavior of some of the women
who attended the open forum???
You must remember that because
I have criticized your method,
this does not mean I am also
criticizing your goal. Ireccgnizc
fully the seriousness of harass-
ment.

I have been racially harassed

myself, and 1 have dealt directly
with female friends who have
been raped and/or harassed. I
know that I cannot fully under-
stand the terror of rape, but I do
know how it affects me. I know
how it feels to have a friend burst
into tears, because something has
reminded her of being raped by a
stranger, a friend, or even rela-
tive. I know what it feels like to
be alienated by a friend who is
afraid to trust men because of
how one man violated her, I am
sure that other men have had
similar experiences, and that they
must feel the same way. I
understand that the pain of rape
begins and ends with the victim,
but through experience, I have
learned that rape also injures
those who care for the victim.
And I see nothing trivial about
this.

Finally, you have insinuated
that in order for me to have sub-
mitted my drawing to the Scarlet
and Black. I must have not lis-
tened at the open forum This
analysis is terribly inaccurate. I
did listen, and I believe I gained
some knowledge from this expe-
rience, but I also believe that
your message was somewhat
clouded and diluted by the anger
directed towards the above-men-
tioned panelists. And because I
agree with your goals, I felt it
was necessary to expose the short
comings of your message, not in
an effort to hinder your progress,
but instead, in an effort to help
you continue forward. I hope
that in this letter I have made my
feelings more clear, and also, that
I have given you a point to pour
der as you proceed forward in
your efforts to make this world
safe for everyone. Jefff Fields
