examine women's
history

by Dan Capone

Two photography exhibits
currently on campus focus on
questions of women‘s history.
Iowa Women in the Workplace.
displayed in the Schaeffer Gallery
of the Fine Arts lobby, depicts
the conditions under which
women worked in turn of the
century Dubuque. Daughters of
the Desert: Women Ant/impala
girls and the Native American
Southwest, 1880-1980, on dis-
play in Burling Gallery, lower
level of Burling Library, exam-
ines the contributions women
made in the study of the native
cultures of the American South-
west.

Iowa Women in the Work-
place is comprised of 35 pho-
tographs from the Klaucr Collec-
tion at the Research Center for
Dubuque Area History, These
photographs, taken in and around
Dubuque during the spring of
1912, document the conditions of
employment women found
throughout turn of the century
America This period was 2| tran-
sitional period in labor history;
women began entering the work
force in large numbers, only to
ﬁnd themselves relegated to dead-
end jobs and earning less than the
male workers they displaced.
Similarities can be found between
the period of these pictures and
today; many of the basic prob
lems depicted are still faced by
women in the work force

research by Dr, Nancy Parezo

.reer in silent film acting for
D.W. Griffeth for whom she
made many ﬁlms including the
melodrama Way Down East
containing the ice flee rescue
scene for which she became fa-
mous. Last year she co-slarred
with Bette Davis in The Whale:
o/Attgurl, giving a performance
for which many felt she should
have been given the Academy
Award. Between Way Down East
and The Whaler lies more than
halfa century and a body of work
lhat has made Miss Gish a living
legend in the American cinema.

Because of her personal
knowledge of the dcvelopmentof
filmmaking, National Public
Television and the American
Film Foundation recently com-
missioned an interview with
Miss Gish, titled An Actor's Life
for Me It premiered this sum-
mer to rave notices. Although it
has not yet been released for gen-
eral distribution, permission has
been granted for a presentation at
Grinnell -- the tape's ﬁrst screen-
ing at a college.

In the interview Miss Gish
speaks simply but powerfully
about the early cinema, the work
of Griffeth, and the development
of the art of the motion picture,

Frontier Film
Series: Shane

by Georgia Dentcl

The American frontier film
series, sponsored by the history
department and Performing Arts
Programs, continues with Shane,
Monday evening at 7:30 (this is a
corrected starting time). Like
many of John Ford's westerns,
Shane, directed by George
Stevens, presents a plot interpree
tative of problems of frontier life
against a west of vast horizons, a
technique especially effective in
Shane because of the picture's
magnificent color and
cinematography

The plot centers on the

problems of frontier isolation and
homesteaders‘ attempts to dcicnd
themselves against cattle barons.
Shane, a reformed gunfightcr,
takes the pan of the homesteaders
and. in doing so fulﬁlls the role
of the "good guy/bad guy" por-
trayed in so many Wcswm films
such as The Man Who Shot Lib-
erry Valence and Butch Carrady
and the SundanceKid.

Brandon deWilde. the
young actor whose career was cut
short by premature death became
famous for his role as the young
boy fascinated by Gunfighter
Shane, played by Alan Ladd

Tampopo: Food, film, and sex

by Dan Capone
Tampopu, Japanese director
Juzo Itami's second film, pokes
fun at oowboy/samurai/good guy-
bod guy movies. Tampopo is a
widow who is trying to make
ends meet by running her late
husband's noodle shop. Her
biggest problem is that she can-
not cook. But she is rescued by
the cowboy hat-wearing hero of
the film. Goro, who drives a
truck adorned by longhomsr He,
along with Tampopo and their
band of friends, sets out to ﬁnd
the secrets of other noodle shops
and thus transform Tampopo's
place into the best and chicest
noodle shop around
A secondary plot involves the
culinary-erotic obsessions of a
gangster in a white suit and his

pleasure-loving, ready-to-do-any-
thing mollt Through these two
the interconnection between eat-
ing and sex is explored. This in-
terconnection is highlighted in
the scene where they share a per-
fect orgasm as the yolk of the
raw egg they are passing back and
forth, mouth to mouth, breaks
and dribbles down her chin

In the end Goro's lask is
accomplished, the noodle shop
having been transformed into the
success Tampopo hoped for: and
Goro, watching the line of people
waiting to get in, gets into his
truck, and leaves. Itami's film is
a satirist's field day, parodying
ﬁlms and genres.

Stakeout: Enjoyable, yet hollow

by Dan Capone

Slakeaut is the most
entertaining of John Badham's
recent string of films: Blue
Thunder, WarGumer, American
F lyers, and Short Circuit. How-
ever, it suffers from direction
which leaves you wondering
whether Badham’s heart was re-
ally in this film. Two cops
(Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio
Estevez) are assigned to the night
shift to watch the former girl-
friend (Madeline Stowe) of an cs-
capod convict (Aidan'Quinn)

Dreyfuss' character, Leece,
finds himself falling in love with

When in (em. to bdhlei, «(s3

the woman he is spying on, lay-
ing the groundwork for the comic
action of the film, This
developing comic situation is in-
tenupted and cut short, however,
by an endless car chase and a
showdown in a sawmillt Ulti-
mately, the comic interaction of
the characters is overshadowed by
the disappointing conclusion and
the too cold. craflsmanlike way
the film is put togetherr it is
enjoyable enough while you are
watching it, but it leaves you
with nothing
