Grinnell students participate
in spiritual gathering

by Todd Francis

"One hundred ﬁfty»six years
ago this land was stolen from the
Sauk and Fox Indians by the
white man, taken from my
grandfather, Black Hawk, whose
statue stands outside the door of
this lodge today. But I have re;
turned from where I live in Okla-
homa today to tell you about
these injustices."

Thus began the Spiritual
Gathering, commemorating the
150th anniversary of the death of
Black Hawk, last weekend in
Rock Island, Illinois, The
speaker was Conference Facilita-
tor Dennis lennings. He spoke
from inside a lodge containing a
museum housing artifacts stolen
from Indian graves in the area.

Saturday's opening prayer was
led by Belo, an Oklahoma Indian,
and while he spoke, all recording
equipment had to be turned offl
Thomas Banyacya, a Hopi elder
from Arizona, led the Sunday
prayer, and also spoke both days,
dicussing the mission his Hopi
community had given him to
leach the world about disappear-
ing indian values and impending
world destruction.

Other speakers on Saturday
included Pat lojola, an Indian

point of view. It won’t be real
and it won't be a Chinese out-
look. So he is skeptical.

This last bit has taken over
an hour to explain, I have asked
him to repeat over and over until
he is speaking very loudly and
very slowly, so slowly it must
hurt.

We are so fatigued by these
efforts that we are reduced to
smiling weakly, and occasionally
pointing to whatever his child is
doing, and smiling some more,

It was then that I was over-
come by a sense of isolation. * In
this moment of exhausted com—
munion, I felt fully how very
little I could understand. Would I
ever be proficient in Chinese? I
felt not.

And even ifI were fluent,
how much of his droughts would
have trickled through to me, and
how much would still have had
to have been chopped up and
pared down and remolded to fit
the shape ofmy narrow outlook?

Although I could feel the
weight of the bodies pressing
against my shoulders on both
sides, I had never before felt so
separate, so impossibly insular.

healer from Albuquerque, and
Maria Pearson, the Governor of
Iowa's Liaison for Indian Affairs.
Pearson spoke of the desecration
of Indian graves in Iowa and a re»
cent law she lobbied for which
has banned such actions.

Sunday, Mahatma Gandhi's
birthday, the focus of the gather
ing shifted from "The Sacred
Earth" to "Peace and Noanio-
lence." Two Asian Indians spoke
of Gandhi's life and beliefs. They
were followed by the most
inspiring speaker at the confer-
ence, Brian Willson. Willson
lost both legs when run over by a
train during a protest against
arms shipments to Central
America, He emphasized that al-
lnougn he believed in non—vio-
lence as a means of attaining so
cial change, he was as violent as
the rest of the people in the
United States who live off the
exploitation of Third World
countries and the environment.

In addition to speakers on
United States Indians, two
Guatemalans spoke about gov-
ernment oppression and injustice
in their homeland. The men cm-
phasized the absence of civil

rights for indigenous people of
Guatemala, and blamed support
from the United States govern-
ment for the oppression.

Eleven students from Grinnell
College's Native American Inter-
est Group attended the gathering.
Although the speeches were the
focus of the afternoon activities,
on Saturday night Lho activity
was a campﬁre by a river that
runs through Rock Island. Ac-
companied by singing and pop
corn, students from Grinnell met
diverse personalities involved
with Rainbow Gatherings, peace
marches, and activist groups from
other campuses

The messagcspfthe confer
once were strong, but controvere
siall "The generalization that the
white man caused all’preblems
and that Indians can solve'them is
excessive," commented Susan
Phillips, one Grinncll student
who attended the conference.
However, she added, "Many so-
cial and environmental ills can be
linked to industrialization and
adopting Indian values of respect
for life and Mother Earth would
be a positive step toward a cure."

the legal system without my
noticing to such an extent that
stealing is no longer considered a
crime'.7 Or, is it just that certain
Grinnell students consider them-
selves above the law’.7

I'm sorry if I sound a bit
irate. You see, I grew up in New
York where stealing is for many
a way of life. I've known several
children (ages 547) who have had

to steal to survive. I thought it
strange when at age seven I

learned that a friend of mine lived
in a burnetl out condemned build
ing v no hear, no windows,
falling bricks. She receive free
lunches from school, hand-me-
down clothes, and welfare. She

never had a bike, or many other
things worth stealing. 'If she had
stolen something ever in her life,
it probably would have been to
help feed and clothe her family.

I doubt very strongly that
there are any students at Grinnell
College so destitute that they
would need to resort to stealing.
Also, I can't imagine someone
feeling they needed to steal a bike
because they didn't care to walk
all the way from South Campus
to North Campus. Then again,
using a stolen bike might enable
them to cross the two block
stretch from South Campus to
North Campus in two minutes
instead of five on foot. Sara

The Grinnell College Catalog
cites Anthropology 261 as
"Agriculture, Religion, and Emr
pirc: Old World Prehistory." It
describes the course as an
"arcliaclogical perspective on
major themes and trends in the
development of Old World civi-
lizations." It does not state that
the students as a group will build
a canoe using only Bronze-age
tools.

However, that is exactly what
Anthropology Professor John
Whittaker and his class of ﬁfteen
students plan to do this weekend

Building a canoe the
old-fashioned way

The studans have fashioned their '
own tools with which they will
dig out the canoe.

The tree they will be using. a
dead Basswood that stood south
of Burling, was removed by
Building and Grounds Thursday
and brought to Anthropology
House at 1217 Park St.
Otherwise, the group will use
nothing else in the building pro-
cess. Whittaker emphasizes that
all are welcome. Work on the
canoe will begin between 10 and
11 Saturday morning at Anthro
House.
