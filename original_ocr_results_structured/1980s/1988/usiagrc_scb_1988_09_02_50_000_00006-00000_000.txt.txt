McConnell's priorities
exclude students

Over the summer there have been few changes at
Grinnell College. Read Hall ﬁnally got its bridge, the
physical plant got a new director, but for the most part,
Gnnnell is the same as when we left it in the spring. One
area that is exactly the same as when we left it is the Health
Center.

Last spring it was announced that the Health Center was
going to cut some of its services, most noticeably the
dis ensing of free over-theecounter medication. Jim
Te ennan, then dean of Student Affairs, stated that the
over—theecounter drugs would instead be sold at the
Bookstore.

The summer has since assed and the medication is not
yet in the Bookstore. Te ennan supplied the Bookstore
with a list of the over-the-counter dru s the Health Center
carried, but the have yet to hit the she ves. Why’.l

"First of a , we've got to compare the list with what
we're already carrying and find out where we're at," says
Dave McConnell, the new supervisor of the Bookstore.
"Finding out where we‘re at" should have been done weeks
ago. What has instead ha pened is the students have found
out where they're at on cConnell's list of priorities: near
the bottom.

A case in oint: the Bookstore recently ran an
advertisement w ieh, McConnell says was to let the
townspeople know about the Bookstore and "more or less
also to let the students know who the merchants are
downtown." The ad. however, was run in the PennySaver,
an advertising showcase which is seen by very few
students. If he had honestly wanted students to see the ad,
the logical place to put it would have been the S and B.

If McConnell ever again considers running for mayor of
Grinnell, he would seem to have built a solid base for
support amongst the local merchants.

Student recounts bad experience at
Black Cultural-Center

To the editor.

On Saturday night as I ap-
proached the Black Cultuml Cenr
ter in search of a pany, I began to
get an uneasy feeling, as if I may
not fit in. Then I thought to
myself of three reasons why I
should enter this house on tenth
street for the first time, even
though I am now ajunior. One -
a black friend and classmate of
mine was taking me there. Two
- this is Grinnell and everyone is
supposed to be liberal minded and
friendly. And three - (the reason
which pushed me to step forward
and be the first person to enter
the house) the Black Cultural
Center campaigned a lot last year
trying to incorporate whites into
the activities and lives of the
black students on this campus.

Upon entering the house we
were met at the door by a very
sociable freshman. He introduced
himself and instantly put me
much more at ease. Unfortu-
nately, from this point forward
was a total disaster. As I moved
to the next room I overheard one
person complaining to another
about the presence of white peo—
ple. I quickly turned from uneasy
to upset to irrate. However, I
continued on my journey through
the house. After standing around
for a few minutes watching pm.
plc fiddle with a broken stereo I
tumed back towards the front door
in search of some other people I
had arrived with. When I Saw
two of them outside walking
from the house I went to the door
to call them. This is when the
second blow struck me. As I
opened the door to call out, one
of a group of black students site

Against the

grain

Through the course of my life
I have heard the callings of many
a popular cause. "Just say no",
"We can create life without war",
"Keep your morals off of my
body", and a myriad of other say-
ings that generally accompany a
very popular social movement in
their own right. This week peace
is popular, next week it may be

drug-free schools. Aparthicd, the
homeless, SDI. causes come and
go like snowﬂakes. I have found
that a great number of people
will support a cause If that cause
is popular. Do people really care
or are they merely following the
crowd?

A lot of people are really go-
ing to hate this column. That's
the whole point. Before I go any
further, let me tell you what to
expect. This column is going to
be the antithesis of whatever the
popular cause of the week is. If
it‘s Peace Week, expect a column

 

ting on a couch yelled out
sarcastically, "awww, leaving so
soon'l." Now smoke was pufﬁng
out of my ears because I was so
pissed off.

I don’t know what excuses
these individuals may conjure up.
Perhaps this was supposed to be
a party for Blacks alone. I really
don't know or care what the rea—
son is. The fact is that I was
there and these few individuals
were more than rude to me. I

don't feel that this is acceptable
behavior under any circum»
stances. They could have simply
asked me to leave. I can only
hope I was the unfortunate victim
in a rare incident of this sort in
the Black Cultural Center. I also
hope this unfortunate experience
of mine is not truly indicative of
the attitudes of a segment of this
campus’ black community to-
wards the rest of the student
body. David Davis

Petition aims to end
hunger, homelessness

To the Editor:

On Thursday, September 8,
Students to Help the Homeless
will be in the post ofﬁce and the
Forum with a petition aimed at
ending hunger and homelessness
in the United States. This peti—
tion was sent to us by the Cam—
paign to End Hunger and Homer
lessness, a group sponsoring a
nationwide campaign to call
government attention to the
problems of hunger and home-
lessness. This petition will be
sent to both presidential candir
dates. Please take a few minutes
out of your day to add your
signature to the lists.

The campaign is also sponr
soring a program asking people
to send old keys to the presiden-
tial candidates, along with a note
stating something along the lines
of "This is the key to my vote, I

will be watching your stand on
these i ues at the polls." Any»
one willing to sacrifice old, use-
less keys to a good cause can
leave them at the post office or
the Fonim on Thursday as well.

 

Students to Help the Home
less also needs help closer to
home. Anyone willing to drive
food from the Grinncll Food 4
Less to shelters in Des Moines
on Tuesdays and/or Thursdays,
contact Debbie. box 6704 or
Karen, box 8430.

We will once again be mak-
ing our regular Saturday trips to
the shelters to help out with any
work that needs to be done. If
you would like to join us, meet
in the Forum Grill at ll:00 am.
(home by dinner time). Anne

"Because life without

conflict is boring"

rcvelling the necessity of war, if
the focus of the week is minority
rights, expect a reactionary bash-
ing of equal rights. The idea is:
whatever opinion is held by the
majority will be the opposite of
the one expressed in this column.

Don't get me wrong, I may
like the ideas of peace and equal-
ity, but there is no cause so just
or noble that it should be ac-
cepted without question. Above
any single cause I believe in the
process of drinkng for oneself.
and that is not possible when
only one side of any given issue
is being presented. It is some—
what similar to placing a belief
in democracy above the belief in
either the Democrats or the Re
publicans. You can't have a
democracy unless you have at
leasttwo canidates, and similarly,
you can‘t make a decision
whether or not to support a cause
unless you've heard both sides.

It may seem as though I am
rambling on, but by mid»
semester the necessity of this
disclaimer will be more than ap
parent.

 

Expect to start hating my
guts next week.

Per nul

To place a personal in the

message to the Scarlet and

Black through campus

Boy please send a note to
