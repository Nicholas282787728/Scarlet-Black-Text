Students busted
on Haines third

by Dave Jones

Two Grinneli students were
arrested and charged with posses-
sion of marijuana last Friday
night on the third floor of I-Iaines
Hall. The Grinnell Police De-
partment was responding to a
complaint that people were sit—
ting in the hallway, playing cards
and smoking marijuana.

Sergeant Randy Hanssen,
the arresting officer, said that the
police received the complaint at
about 9:45 pm. Before they
came to campus to investigate,
Hansscn phoned Tom Crady,
dean of Student Affairs. to in-
form him that they were going
onto the campus to follow up on
a complaint. Both Crady and
Grinnell Police Chief Dan Boyer
are quick to stress that the police
department has no obligation to
inform college officials in this

kind of situation, but that it is a ‘

common practice.

"Under most circum-
stances, we'll contact them and
let them know that we're going

 

to be on campus . . . It‘s not
something we're required to do.
it‘s just a courtesy." Boyer said.
According to Hanssen.
when he and his partner arrived
on Haines 3rd at 10:15 pm, the
two students were sitting in the
hallway playing cards, and there
was a "bong," a kind of pipe used
for smoking marijuana, sitting
next to them. "It had burnt
marijuana leaves in it," Hanssen
said. The two students, who
were the only ones in the hall-
way, were immediately arrested
for possession of the controlled
substance
The two students face up to
a $300 fine each for possession
of marijuana, which is a misde-
meanor. Their arraignment is set
for Tuesday (Nov. 15). One of
the students faces an additional
charge of unlawful use of a
driver's license. As they were
being placed under arrest, one of
the students showed the police a
falsiﬁed Iowa Driver's License.

Deﬁcit, Quayle intiuenge college vote
Students flock to polls, overwhelmingly favor Democrats

by Kim Eckart and Jennifer
Watson

Although the 1988 presi-
dential election installed a repub-
lican in the White House, the
Congress remains strongly
democratic. Vice-President
George Bush won convincingly,
earning over 400 electoral votes,
but his defeat of Massachusetts
Governor Michael Dukakis did
not reﬂect the vote of the state of

Iowa or of the Grinnell College
campus.

Random polling at
Fairview Elementary School re-
vealed the strong support for
Dukaldsl Students cited deﬁcit
concerns as one of the major rea
sons they voted for the Mas-
sachusetts governor. "The deﬁcit
is the worst problem today . . .

Dttkakis‘ plan of raising taxes is
more honest than Bush's plan to
reduce the capital gains tax," said
one sophomore.

Others displayed anxiety
over the past republican policies.
"I don't like the way things have
gone for the past eight years, and
I don't think George Bush can
change that. I think Dukakis

Finally, there was the ever~

freshman said, "I don't think
Quayle is old enough or smart
enough to even deserve to run the
country."

Democrats," he said.

One Campus Democrat
summed up his organization's re-
action. "It's a dark, dark day." he
said.

Only a minority of college
students polled supported George
Bush. "1 voted for Bush because
I agree with his economic and
foreign policies," said a fresh-
man.

Campus Republican Head
Gene McClure commented on the
lack of an ideological mandate.
"The results aren't anything un-
expected . l l l Itjust didn't carry
over into Iowa, and there was no
major shift in Congress."

While some students
strongly supported a candidate.
many expressed their dissatisfac-
tion with the available choices.
"Unfortunately, in this case. it
wasn't who was the best person
for the job, but rather the lesser
of two evils," said a junior.

One republican slated an
optimistic view for the next for
years. "The new right. We're
ready to lead." he said.
