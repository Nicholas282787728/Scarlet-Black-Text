Catch ~22

by John Newmark

Ii you want a movie to succeed,
all you have to do is find a best-
selling novel and adapt a movie to
it. However, movies adapted irom
bestselling novels tend to be ilops.
Catchrzz. ltmakes periect sense. ii
any movie adaptation would be
able to outmaneuver this catch-22.
it would be “Catchr22” itself,
especially considering the ex
perience of the men involved. The
director, Mike Nichols, had just
finished shooting ”The Graduate"
when he began work on the film,
Buck Henry, the screen writer, had
had experience writing comedy ior
such television shows as ”Get
Smart" and “That Was The Week
That Was.” There was only one
obstacle. As a review in a 1970
issue oi Film Quarterly explains,
Joseph Heller’s World- War-II
novel “is over 400 pages long and it
has almost 50 characters, with a
profusion of detail about each
one." This is not an ideal situation
for a twochour movie,

In order to condense the novel in-
to two hours, 17 characters had to
be cut, along with many scenes.
Nichols and Henry. in order to
make more sense out of their
editing decisions. decided to use
only characters or events which
had a direct relationship with the
main character, Yossarian, This
has the obvious benefit of making
the story linea lot clearer than that
in the novel. One oi the largest
complaints about Heller's novel IS
the Confusion that the extraneous
characters and events cause
However, Nichols and Henry striv-
ed hard to retain the nightmarish
atmosphere this confusron helped
to create,

The main downfall of the transla-
tion from book to film is the loss of
some of the humor Heller used in
his novel. The film starts off funny,
but gets more serious near the end,
as the audience becomes more
aware oi the nightmare going on.
Much of the film‘s humor is even
darker and more grisly than
Heller’s. However. while some
things are lost in the translation, it
is still a good movie to watch. The
film was well cast with such
iamous actors as Orson Welles,
Anthony Perkins, and Alan Arkin.

Silent Running

by Thomas Klouda

Do you remember when you
were young and your parents
would take you to a park to play on
the green grass, climb a tall tree,
and bask in the warm sunlight?
And do you look forward to ex»

periencing that with your
children? Imagine thiS' the earth
becomes defoliated and barren and
the only natural vegetation is in
space domes circulating the solar
system, awaiting the moment
when refoliation can begin. But,
because or a lack oi government
iunding. the domes are ordered
destroyed along with the last hope
ior a green earth. That is the plot oi
the trim “Silent Running,"
directed by special—eiiects wizard
Douglas Trumbull.

After making his reputation as a
master or special eiiects by work-
ing on Stanley Kubrick’s “2001: A
Space Odyssey, " Trumbull decide
ed to make a iilm employing more
oi his specialeiiects talents and
the use or robots. The only thing he
needed a script, in collaboration
with Deric Washburn, Mike
Cimino, and Steve Eocho, Trumc
bull generated a script that centers
around conservationism. high
ideals, rebellion, and Sella
sacrifice. Set in the future, aboard
a spaceship, the lilm employs his
skills with special eiiectsiwhil
also exploring and developing ne
robot technology, . n ,

“Silent Running" centers on
Freeman Lowell (Bruce Derri ). the
only member of the ship to protest
and rebel against the decision to
destroy the domes, After removing
the other crew members in highly
inhuman ways, he anthropomorc
phizes the ship's three robots to act
as his companions: :t.he.iarge,..

time hiding the ship from the rest
oi the ileet and nurturing Earth's
last botanical heritage in hopes
that one day it Will return home.

"Silent Running” was received

expected when a him is the pro-

been greater it it was intended to
be that alone. instead or also
displaying new special eiiects.

Looking beyond all its faults and
taking in to consideration the
wonderful soundtrack by Joan
Baez, “Silent Running" is an
entertaining film that causes
you to stop and think about the
state oi our earth’s natural
resources, This is why the En-
vironmental interest Group has
chosen to sponsor this iilm in honor
oi Arbor Day (Friday, April 29).
We can only hope that ii people see
this iilm and are concerned about
the future it depicts. they will want. .,
to take an active role in protecting
the earth’s environment. . '
