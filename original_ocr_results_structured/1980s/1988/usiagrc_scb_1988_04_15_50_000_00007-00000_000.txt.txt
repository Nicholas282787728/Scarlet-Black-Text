Visual Art Students
Fault Art Columnist

To the Editor:

As concerned visual-art
students, we are writing in reac-
tion to arts editor Vincent
Prosser’s offensively inept art cola
umns. In last week’s issue, dearest
Vince focused on Carnegie’s ceil-
ing, part of an enlightening series
on Grinnell’s “architectural
mess." Once again, Prosser
blatantly ignores any student,
faculty, community, or traveling
art exhibitions and chooses instead
to complain about the irrelevant
ancient architecture oi campus
buildings.

As a result, many shows gn un-
noticed, except by the iew students
who happen to wander into one oi

the three campus galleries: Burl-,

ing, Forum Terrace, and Fine Arb
lobby. Vincent's latest article,
“Dreck at Grinnell No. 1,” serious
ly negates the hard work by both
iaciilty and students that is cur-
rently displayed in the three
separate galleries. We take his
total dismissal ot these shows as a
direct kniie in the back.

Although the administration
shows little support tor the art

department, we feel that it is a
viable goal tor the Scarlet and
Black to support the visual arts.
This can be achieved by consistent

coverage oi exhibitions on campus '

by a real arts editor whose weekly
columns would be an endorsement
of student and faculty work. In
turn, visual arts at Grinnell would
be more approachable to the cams
pus; people would know about curv
rent art shows and be excited to
see them,

It may be difficult to understand,
but we visual artists need an au-
dience to react to our work. You
may normally purchase a ticket to
view a piece oi artwork as you do
to see a movie or other forms of
“entertainment," yet this doesn‘t
mean that the artists don‘t want or
don’t need feedback from an an
dience.

Therefore, a consistent arts coins
mentary in the Scarlet and Black
would encourage people to view
the work and spark the potential
for aesthetic reactions. Visual art
is not done to be kept in the dark. 7

On Second Thought

Bill Lohaus

There is a book out b’y‘iAlao‘

Bloom called “The Closing Of The
American Mind” which deals with
the death of liberal education, it
deals with the lack of rigor in
American education in general,
and the lack of breadth of
,American post-secondary educa-
tion in particular. In short: as
American institutions foster pre-
proiessionalism and permit ex
tremely narrow curricula for
undergraduates (centering around
a major), the beneiits oi
analytical, objective thought
which accrue irom taking a broad
base of courses are lost. Further-
more, as students become more
conservative, they attempt to put a
liberal race on it by being tolerant
oi others and being valuerrelative.
in plain words: instead oi having
firm beliefs which we stand behind
and are willing to defend, we, as
students, are content to give lip
service to the right or others to do
their own thing while surrendering
our right (and ability) to speak out
for our own belieis. Everyone is
OK. We can all get along iine. it
other people think diiierently, hey,
that’s cool, too. But we don't CARE
what they think, we don't even
really know what WE think And
because we don’t argue with each
other, staying within a broadly
“liberal” framework in our discus
sions, we iail to understand other
perspectives and, equally
dangerous, iail to develop our posi»

tions on issues. We are unden'nin-
ing our own abilities to develop as
sound thinkers because we don’t
have to defend our beliefs.

i often read graffiti in Burling
about “knee-jerk liberals,” and
though at first I paid it little heed, I
now see that much of it is valid.
Exhibit A: the Relays/Peace Day
debate. it you weren't ior Peace
Day, people called you a “fascist.”
That’s really liberal; let’s put
labels on people and stuff them in
boxes. Once you've got them
stereotyped you no longer need to
respect what they have to say, It‘s
the ad hominem iallacy — knocks

is that selfrprofessed ”liberals"
are practicing a iorm oi leitist
closed-mindedness that is certain»
ly no better than conservatism,
and actually much worse. Liberal
implies open-minded and eclectic;
what I've seen lately is neither.
The trash that's passing itseli oil
as liberal is superiicial concern
over trendy social issues and ar-
rogant disrespect tor the ideas oi
others. This is not to say that there
are no people here who are
dedicated to social justice, merely
that the trend is toward support ior

Reader Questions Newmark’s

Credibility

To the Editor:

i guess John Newmark has as
mu h right as anyone to proiicr
p0! ical commentary. It's not his
right 1 question, it’s his qualificar
tions. Newmark‘s column in last
week's paper was entitled,
“Former Democratic Candidates
victims oi Misunderstanding."
However, the column served to
display Newmark's own lack oi
understanding. 1 don’t know where
he gets his political iniormation or
how he iorms his ideas, but
Newmark certainly provides no
useiul insight into the presidential
race. It seems that he is not even
capable oi reasonably assimilating
other political analystsY ideas into
a column oi his own. His essay is
full of incorrect assertions that are
sorely lacking any sort oi justificar
tion.

The basic conclusion that one
can draw irom the commentary is
that in order to be a good candidate
tor the Democratic nomination you
have to have dropped out oi the
race. With one exception,
Newmark praises all ot the cam
didates who have left the race. And
he proclaims that all oi these can-
didates could have easily defeated
George Bush. (I don’t know of any
experts who would say that Bruce
Babbitt could have easily defeated
Bush) One conclusion could be
that Newmark is a Republican,
and either he is telling Democratic
voters how stupid they are ior
eliminating the good candidatesi
or he is trying to convince them
that this'has happened and thus
they should vote ior Bush. i don't
really think either of these are
true, though. it is more likely that
Newmark is just trying to prove

his “neat” theory that all or the
good Democrats are out ,

Newmark states that “the iirst
victim" or misunderstanding was
Joseph Biden. lie laments the fate
oi Riderl, who “wasn't trying to
hurt anyone," and only committed
“unfortunate errors oi omission.”
For Christ's sake. Biden copied,
nearly verbatim, some stirring
lines irom the campaign speech oi
Neil Kinnock, the leader oi the
second-largest party in Britain.
Eiden made no attempt to
acknowledge that the inspiration
tor the speech was not his own.
That's not omission, that's iraud.

Next Newmark claims that, con
trary to most political analysts ac-
counts, Dick Gephardt in iact
“desired to make trade more
free.” This statement is not ex
plained or justiﬁed in any way by
Newmark.

Bruce Babbitt, who would be vic-
tim number two, was iorced to
drop out because “nobody
listened,“ argues Newmark, who
doesn't seem to comprehend the
possibility that people listened but
liked other candidates more, Cer-
tainly the voters oi Iowa (the only
state Babbitt really competed in)
had ample opportunity to hear
Babbitt‘s message.

Finally there’s Paul Simon, who
was so “clean-cut and respectable-
looking" that everyone assumed
that he had something to hide.
Where did you get that one, John?
I’ve never heard anyone accuse
Simon oi having anything to hide
(except perhaps for his earlobes).

In turning to the remaining can-
didates, Newmark iinds that the
one least likely to succeed, Al

Gore, is oi course the best one leit.
He argues that Gore is ”conser-
vative enough" to beat Bush,
Newmark iails to see through the
spin that Gore has been putting on
his stances. A number oi
magazines have rated Gore as one
of the most liberal senators
Anyone who heard him speak on
campus last year can testiiy to the
liberalness of his views. However,
calling him the best oi remaining
candidates [it nicely into
Newmark’s wonderiul theory,
because Gore has no chance oi top-
ping Jackson or Dokakis.

This brings me back to the excep
tion that l noted earlier. There is
one candidate who has dropped out
that Newmark does not praise, or
even mention, l reier oi course to
Gary Hart. (Let‘s see. he actually
would be victim number one 7 not
Biden — and also victim number
four. l guess.) i can only assume
that Newmark leaves out Hart
because even ior Newmark it
would be too much to claim that
Gary Hart could have easily beaten
George Bush. Thus Hart does not fit
neatly into Newmark‘s theory, and is
conveniently ignored.

C’mon, John, it you’re going to
use upspacein theS and B, at least
write about a topic which you can
handle with some credibility. Your
political commentary had no loun-
dation in fact and provided no serr
vice to anyone who read it. And
please, next time spare us the long,
silly, and totally unrelated in»
troduction. Or have you coniused
politics with iairy tales? — Joel

Baseball: An Experience
Unto Itself

John Newmark

it isn't oiten that there is nothing
in the realm oi politics or religion
that interests me, However, at
least once a year, it does occur, At
times such as this, only one subject
truly matters to me, the same sub
ject millions of Americans think oi
when the iresh airs oi spring begin
to blow, the ilowers bloom, and the
trees turn green Green. Whether it
be grass or artiiicial turi, the color
is still the same. The baseball leave
ing the pitcher’s hand, hitting the
batter’s bat, soaring through the
air, and landing in the unsuspecs
ting hands oi a child, cheering his
team on in the bleacher seats The
broadcasters on radio and Tv
simultaneously yell, “Home run!"
And iireworks go oil Literally, as
hidden crews ignite them in
celebration oi the tremendous hit.
And figuratively in the minds or all
the ians.

The baseball season has started,
All your normal worries are gone.
Forget the big calculus exam next
Monday. The history paper due in
two weeks completely slips your
mind There is only one question on
your mind. Can they wim Not just
this one game, but could they ac-
tually manage to make it to the
playoiis this year? And, it they can
make it to the playoiis, what about
the World Series? Might we
become world champions? “We,"
because in the game oi baseball,
the team you support becomes
synonymous with yourseli. it thcy
win the division, you win the divi-
sion, li they win the pennant, you
win the pcnnaiit And it they

receive World Series rings. you
receive a World Series ring. At
least in your mind, ior it is there
that you and the team merge and
become one. it is much more ex-
citing than either poiitics or
religion it is baseball, the
American pastime,

You will oiten iind me in the
coming months with a headset and
a Sony Walkman. seemingly
oblivious to the world l am not
listening to Madonna's most recent
hit, nor a tape or the Beatles. And
contrary to what one oi my pros
iessors recently thought when he
entered the classroom and saw me
taking bit the headphones, i am not
studying Russian or listening to
Beethoven l am being hypnotized
by the mighty voice oi the immorr
tal Jack Buck, known by all St.
Louisans as the Voice oi the Car»
dinals. l might be listening to Buck
describe Vince Coleman’s lead oii
iirst. The game oi cat and mouse
that Vince and the opposing pit»
cher might play, or the split second
between when he starts to run and
the moment he is called saie at se-
cond. He might be describing the
bottom oi the ninth, with Worrcll
or Dayley on the mound, the iinal
three outs oi the game. And when
that iinal out is made, he might
shout, “That‘s a winner!”

Some people cheer tor the Cubs.
some ior the Orioles, others ior
other teams l must even admit
that there do exist tans [or evcn the
Mets and the Twins, even though
those are the two teams l presently
loathe the most Third on my hate

list is the New York Yankees, and
then perhaps the Royals. However.
the Royals are an old grudge, and i
can now handle myseli a lot better
than I used to when confronted by a
Royals ian. Baseball is a game oi
good and evil with numerous
teams battling it out ior
supremacy. Hatred tor a team that
has beaten you in the past is
natural, but the hatred disappears
in time when the tables turn and
you beat them

The enjoyment one receives
when listening on the radio, wat-
ching on Tv, or best oi all when you
are at the ballpark itseli, is dila-
iicult to explain to people who
haven't experienced it themselves.
Critics say there is no action, but'
the baseball fan will vehemently
disagree. While the action may be
dilierent irom the kind one sees at
a mere hockey or iootball game, it
is much superior, it is the bottom
oi the ninth, the bases are loaded.
there are two men out, and the
score is tied. The pitcher throws
the ball towards the batter, and the
whole stadium, plus all those watr
ching Tv, plus all those listening to
the radio, hold their breath, it you
ever see me holding my breath
while wearing a set oi headphones,
don’t you dare try to talk to me.
For ii you cause me to miss the
play oi the game. 1 shall kill you.
Yes, 1 know I said a tow months
ago that I didn't believe in capital
punishment, but under those cir-
cumstances, l’m not sure i could
control myseli.
