McConnell has changes in mind for mailroom and Bookstore

Continued Irom Page 2
With regard to the physical ap-
' pearance of the post ofﬁce itself,
McConnell 'stressed that the cages
that have been set up in the pub-
lic post ofﬁce area are only tem-
porary. They are necessary to
contain the large number of
packages that are sent to the
Grinnell Campus at this time of
the year. Students can expect to
see the cages again at the end of
the year, when the number of
packages increasu once more.
McConnell sees a need for a
more effecuve policy to deal with
the "paper proliferation" associ-
ated with campus stuffings. He
has plans to designate post office
bulletin board space for different
types of notices. Instead of
smiling all mailboxes with an
announcement, an organization
would post the announcement on
the board and provide a box of
copies for people who wanted the
information.

Reducing all-campus stuff—
ings through the use of the bul-
letin boards. he said, would
eliminate the waste of resources
resulting from people's throwing
away unwanted announcements
It also would speed up the pro-
cess of delivering mail by allow-
ing employees to spend more
time handling mail that has
"significant value to the student

McConnell is considering ex-
panding the post office's man-
agement of bulletin board space
to managing general
communications bulletin boards
in the dorms. Dorm boards would
carry many of the announcements
that usually are posted all over
the campus, for instance an-
nouncements about radio shows
or the used book sale The prob-
lem with those announcements.
he said, is that the "event occurs,
it passes, and those guys don't go
back and pick up the stuff off the
wall. To manage that on an My
Live basis would really be a good
service to do. We think the mail
service might be the best spot to
try to accomplish that,"

Bookstore Changes

Expansion of service in the
Bookstore means that students
eventually will beable to charge
their purchases with Mastercard
and VISA credit cards.

McConnell also plans to im-
plement a declining points bal-
ance system as an alternative
method of payment. Under this
system, students could establish
an account with the Bookstore
and deposit money there. They
then would use their ID cards to
make their purchases, and the
amount of each purchase would

Under the present system of
credit at the Bookstore, students
may make charges if they have
made arrangements with the trear
surer‘s office, or if the Bookstore
has received permission from the
person who will be receiving the
bill for the students’ purchases,

While he is trying to find ways
to increase service to students,
McConnell was careful to point
out that he wishes to do so with-
out competing with local busi-
nesses. Although Bookstore
changes may involve increasing
volume and decreasing costs.
McConnell said that he does not
"want to increase volume at the
expense of local merchants.
That‘s a hot issue in general, in
all institutions."

McConnell views the fall 1988
semester as a "learning process"
for him as he explores ways to
improve both the post ofﬁce and
the Bookstore, "Everything we
do in there is open for study,
evaluation. and change There‘s
nothing there that can‘t be looked
at," he said.

Pricing Structure
One area that is open to
evaluation is the Bookstores
pricing structure. "Very clearly,
the mission of the Bookstore is
to be a break-even operation,"

our publicly stated mission,
that's our private mission." To
break even, the Bookstore must
retrieve costs to offset
administrative expenses.
Inventory of the Bookstore in
prc~ vious years has been con-
ducted twice a year. but Mc-
Connell hopes to monitor the
business better by increasing in4
ventory to twice a semester.
With regard to future im—
provements of Bookstore ser-
vices. McConnell said that he

will be exploring the feasibility
of establishing a textbook rental
system for students.

Student input, according to
McConnell, is important to
improving the Bookstore, so he
is planning to survey students
about their use of the Bookstore
and hopes to have this done by
late October. "I want to ﬁnd out,
what you are buying out of there?
There's no sense in doing any
thing that doesn't deal with your
needs," be said.
