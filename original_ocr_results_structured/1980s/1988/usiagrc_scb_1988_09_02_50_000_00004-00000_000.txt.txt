Close-up view of Republican convention

by William Coffey

As I. my father, and alternate
delegate Mike Tracy entered the
New Orleans airport. we found
ourselves surrounded by a phar
lanx of rowdy middleraged folks
heavily armed with kazoos and
pom- poms We came out the
other side of their gauntlet grin-
ning, asking each other what we‘d
gotten ourselves into. No sooner
did we break into the open than
we spied banners everywhere
bearing the oxymoron:
"Welcome Republicans!" Who
had ever heard of such a thing?
Surely not I. After all. the very
word "Republican" has apparently
become synonymous in many of
my fellow Americans' minds
with ugly, antisocial lraiLs such
as intolerance, greed, elitism, and
sxnugness. Who would ever
welcome that? Well, regardless
of their motives, the people of
New Orleans rolled out the red
carpet for us Yankee carpetbag-
gers.

With regrets extended to Tom
Crady, I forewent my plans to
attend training week for student
staffers. The Opportunity to at-
tend the Republican convention
reared its pretty head in early
June. and the thought of attend-
ing a Mardi Gras for people of
my political stripe seduced me.
The reason this opportunity fell
in‘ my lap goes back to the year
1965. when a three-year—old Mike
Tracy announced to his parents
that he wanted to be President of
the United States. Twentyrthree
years later, at age 26, Mike's
goals are still as lofty. A poll -
calescience major who graduated
from Lake Forest College four
years ago. Mi . with my father,
planned a victorious campaign for
alternate George Bush delegate
under clouds of pipe smoke, and
over countless cups of coffee.
The strategy they devised was up
to the task of singling Mike out
of a crowded field of 29 people
vying for the slot. Mike‘s
participation promised to serve

well his larger strategy of gaining
recognition among Illinois’ Re-
publican bigwigs. while at the
same time maintaining his inde—
pendence. As for my father, he
wanted to see New Orleans. We
all got what we wanted.

Although We stayed with the
Illinois delegation. I owe many
thanks to Al Pindcr of the Grin-
nell Herald-Register for making
over a dozen phone calls all
across the state of Iowa in order
to secure Superdome guestpasses
for me Lhrough the Iowa delega-
tton.

I won't try to relate all that I
saw and experienced during the
week. Not that I saw so many
amazing things. Rather, a good
portion of it was the stuff that
anyone could have seen by sim-
ply tuming on the TV. Only I
had a worse seat. In spite of that,
I found beneﬁts to being "behind
the scenes" apart from parlaking
of the general sense of excitement
andpagearttry.

SUNDAY: SURREJLITY

After unpacking, Mike and I
flagged a cab on Sunday night,
bound for a reception. purportedly
hosted by Gerald Ford, for Rear
gan's minority appointees. Mike
and I had botll hoped to meet
Ford. Mike wanted to meet Ford
because he and Ford are pen-pals
but have never met; while I
thought of Ford as a fellow
Michigander. and therefore a
gmnfalloonrmate. Our quest was
partially unsuccessful. Ford
never showed. But we had stum—
bled into an interesting evening
regardless. We‘d given the driver
an address, and spent the next 20
minutes watching the fare climb.
By then full of skepticism, we'd
at last pulled up in front of a
warehouse called "Mardi Gras
World." We entered another
world, an eerie. spooky place
stuffed with enormous, half-lit
Mardi Gras ﬂoats and skulls the
size of a Chevy. Between the
rows of this parked parade we saw

perhaps 300 people. some seated.
others milling about, all dressed
to the ninths. It turned out we'd
crashed a party for tile black Re»
publican elite. Truth be told,
surreal isn't always a blast. We
did feel out of place. But the
event was appreciable. And be
cause of Ilie excruciating speeches
at this soiree, we couldn’t have
been the only ones who fell out
of place. Each speaker managed
to string together cliches and
lame assertions to the effect:
"See all these (rich) blacks? We
Republicans really DO reach out
to minorities!" Satisfied that Itl
seen the height of Republican
smugness, I concurred when
Mike suggested
we split.

MONDAY: REAGAN'S
DAY

On Monday the first two ses-
sions convened, Reagan spoke.
Then we Republicans resumed
weaning ourselves of his Presi-
dcncy.

TUESDAY MORNING:
ON THE FLOOR

Tuesday morning, while

Mike found other diversions, I

made my way to the ﬂoor of the

convention for the third session

phones. flash bulbs and tape
recorders. Posing as a youthful
alternate delegate, I caught the
attention of a reporter from the
publierradio station broadcasting
out of Champaigne»Urbana. He
wanted two minutes of my time,
which I couldn't refuse. I hope
no one checked up on me. but it
was fun to banter with him about
my "experience" as the "youngest
member" of the Illinois delegar
tion. A few minutes later, a fel-
low summoned me to join the
Illinois delegates in their tightly-
secured section near the podium.
After perfunctorily waving a
poster that said "Michel" (Bob
Michel, Illinois' own minority
whip in the US House) I began
exploring the delegate section.
taking in the ambiencc, knowing
full well someone would toss the
out soon. Someone did. but not
before I took a few good photos.
Thing was. the security guard
who did the dirty deed couldn't
have been more than 18. Rather
humiliating. Back in the alter-
nate section, I suppressed a stare
as CBS' Diane Sawyer sauntercd
by with Ed Bradley. And so it
went. until Elizabeth Dole
Illwacked the closing gavel down.
