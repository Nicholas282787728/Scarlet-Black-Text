ment are a fine mix of retuming
letterl'nen and fresh newcomers.
Providing the brunt of the ohvsor
needed leadership will be junior
guard and captain Mike Spurbeck.
Probably supporting Spurbeck at
off guard will be 64 sophomore
Dave Chamberlain. Also in the
buckcourt will be the speedy,
penetrating point guard, sophoe

more Holland Neal. along with 5-
9 freshman Scott Howland.

The Pioneers have some
needed bulk and height atbith the
foward and center spots. Playing
the fowards will be a pair of
sophomores, 6-1 George Mchm-
soy and 6-4 BJ. Jahn, Down
low Grinnell can rotate a four-
some. interchanging them at the
post position: lone senior Phil
Kantzler at 6-5; junior Scott
Wipple. 6-4; 6-6 sophomore
Charlie Frago and the "big" man,
newcomer Chris Jacobson, at 6-
8.

According to Westlund, the
Pioneers can actually throw 12
guys at you during the course of
a ballgame, as they have so much
depth. What's more, they've got
players big and small who are
capable of playing a variety of
positions, which gives the team
ﬂexibility both on offense as
well as defense. Says Westlund,
"We rally benefit from a com-
pliment of players, different types
of ballplayers who will undoubtr
edly help the program." One
thing is undeniable; they'll scrap
and hustle on every play for the
entire game, regardless of the
score.

Westlund takes his troops
onto the floor for their first game
tonight, at Lake Forest. The Pie
oneers will begin, lightin' up

Swimming season set to begin
Buddhas: great depth Women look for their

with 44 swimmers

by Laura Whitmorc

Grinnell‘s men's swim
team is gearing up for their ‘887
‘89 season. After scoring a record
number of points in last season's
conference championship (win-
ning for the ninth time in ten
years). the Pioneers look forward
to another successful year.

Calling it, "as good a
working team as we've ever had,"
coach Ray Obermiller is opti-
mistic about this season’s team.
With 44 swimmers it's the
largest team at Grinnell in his
twenty-three years of coaclling,
which gives Grinnell, "a lot of
depth. tremendous depth." With
twenty-one returning lettermen,
the Pioneers have plenty of
experience, too.

Returning swimmers to
watch for include senior captains,
Scott Patrick and Martin Moon,
juniors John Williams, Scot
Potts. Kevin Doersehug, and
Darek Bushnaq and diver Phil
Bishop. Junior Peyton Engel
who was recovering from knee
surgery last year is also back and
should be a force on the team.
Returning sophomores are Tom
Nelson. who set two school
records last year, Steve Hom—
bacher, David Troy. and Eric
Sandeen.

Obermillcr sees a lot of
promise in the eighteen freshmen
swimmers on the team. Joe
Zimscn and David Ressner are
"two of the most outstanding
freshmen," Obermiller has ever

 

coached. Other promising frosh

are Todd Smith, Mark Anderson
and Steve Clem.

The season starts Friday at
7 pm. with a tough meet against
Wash. U., who‘ve already got six
meets under their belts. Then on
Saturday, Grinnell is the host for
the Pioneer Relays, where Mane
Cato (Division II) looks to offer a
challenge. Get out of the freez-
ing cold, and enjoy the balmy
temperatures inside the PEC pool
and cheer our swimmers on.

 

 

second straight title

by Gordon Schreibcr
The Grinnell women's
swim team opens its season this
weekend with a dual meet at
home. On Friday night the team
will switn against Washington
University, and on Saturday it
will host the Pioneer Relays.
Sheila Cain is enthusiastic
in her first year as head coach af—
ter having worked as an assistant
coach for the Iowa State women‘s
team. After having lost some
valuable seniors from last year.
the team will be led by senior
Katy Furnish. sophomore Debbie
Koa and junior diver Colleen
Murphy, all national qualifiers
from a year ago. The team will
also be bolstered by this year’s
freshmen class, whose strengths
are IM and butt‘efly. Cain said.

"'Thcre is a group of talented

freshmen who will contribute and
give the team added depth."
Workouts this season have
concentrated on strokework and
endurance and have been going
well despite some sickness and

several injuries. Cain recognizes

that the early season yardage has
been a bit more thtm the team has
been used to in the past but feels
it will pay off when the confer-
ence meet rolls around. She is
focusing on the‘end of the season
and hopes to "win conference and
qualify as many people as possir
ble for nationals.“ She also
‘stressed that she just wants the
women to swim well on the way
to attaining their goals.

Cain was positive about

the teams chance for defending
the conference title. As for the
other teams in the conference,
Coc appears to have improved
over last year and Lake Forest
should present a strong challenge
to the Pioneer championship
hopes.

This weekend presents a
lest for the team because Wash-
ington University has already
swnm several tnects this year,
while the Pioneer Relays will be
the first official college meet of
the year for Grinnell. Despite the
fact that Cain is the third head
coach in as many seasons, the
team is adjusting well to hot

coaching style and looking for-
ward to the upcoming season.
Friday's meet begins at 7 pm.
and Saturday‘s meet starts at 10
a.m.
