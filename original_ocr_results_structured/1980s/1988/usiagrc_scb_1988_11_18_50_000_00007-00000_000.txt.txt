newspapert However. there are ground rules which must be
followed to ensure that letters are in the best interests of all

We encourage letters and will print them intact as soon as
time and space permit. Letters in poor taste, judged to be
libelous or not following the guidelines will not be published.

Letters must be signed when they are submitted for
publication. Names will be withheld upon request only in
very rare instances. If it is clear that printing a name will
jeopardize someone's employment or personal well-being, then
it will be withheld. We will print an anonymous letter
only after consulting with the author.

The deadline for letters is midnight the Tuesday before
publication. Letters must be submitted either via the Vax
system (tell Scarlet) or through campus mail (typed).

Students' defense of
ACLU called "mythical"

To the Editor:
I wish to respond to the re-
cent opinion letter which defended
the ACLU. l hardly have any
Lime to write response that i be
lieve to be warranted in View of
the many assumptions that the
previous letter made about the
Constitution, so l'm just going
to give people a few things to
consider. While I honestly be-
lieve that the previous letter was
written with good intentions, I
think that created more myths
about the ACLU than it removed.
First, I wish to suggest
that many of the ACLU's causes
are unpopular simply because
they are not as ﬁrmly grounded in
the Constitution as recent sup-
porters of the ACLU would have
you believe. For the sake of
time, let me use some of the ex-
amples mentioned in the previous
letter to your paper My honorv
ablc opponenm saw ﬁt to claim
that the freedom of speech pro~
tects pornography and that movie
ratings are a violation of that
same liberty which is protected
under the first Amendment.
These arguments rest upon the
assumption that any limit to the
freedom of speech is unconstitu-
tional. Fortunately, this is not
true. I doubt that the people who
wrote the ACLU endorsement
would say that the spreading of
vicious lies and rumors with the
intent of harming somebody is
protected by the first Amend-
ment. Such actions are known as
"slander" or "libel." As anyone
who has taken Mrt Strauber's
Constitutional Law class can tell
you, even Constitutional rights
have limitations when they come
into conflict with other
Constitutional rights. 1 would
argue that this is because the
Constitution is not just cone
ccrncd with rights. but with ju_s-
Liﬂ as wellt
Let me specifically address
the limitations of freedom of
speech concerning pomegraphy.
The right to freedom of speech is
usually jmtilied‘by ‘

'l‘lllgtlhat

it: encourages the discovery of
the truth, acts as a check upon
government, and is necessary for
one to lead an autonomous life.
Taking each of these in turn, let's
begin with the firstjustiﬁcation.

Perhaps I am a bit naive,
but it is hard for me to understand
what "truth" is disclosed by
pornography. Then again, per—
haps this confusion about
pomography's "truthful" content
is not on my pan, but on the part
of the ACLU members who
wrote in last week. The second
justification is that the freedom
of speech acts as a check upon
government. Now, how pornog»
raphy acts as a check upon gov-
crnmcnl officials is beyond me.
Unless, Gary Hart has expanded
his activities Lastly, the free-
dom of speech is argued to be es-
sential to individual autonomy or
the development of one's person~
alityt This is probably the best
justification for pomegraphy un~
dcr the freedom of speech. How-
ever, one must remember that
rights are not absolute. Some
would argue that pornography is
not only offensive, but is also
harmf 1. These people contend
that pornography is a harm which
should not be protected because it
perilously degrades women, For
example, say a pornography
movie depicts a woman being
raped. And thanks to our chamr
pion the ACLU, many young
boys are allowed to see this un-
rated movie. Because the rape is
done in the "movie world," it ne-
glects to show how wrong rape is
and these young men come to
view rape as something that
women Enjoy and socially accept.
I grant you that this may be an
exaggeration, but it is worth
considering, As it is now,
pornography is only regulated by
movie ratings, not banned. There
is a difference.

Finally, I think that your
writer‘s views are based on the

Readers rip into Kent's column

Says column "insults every woman on campus"

To the Editor:

Mr. Mike Kent‘s latest
"Against the Grain" column in-
suits every woman on the Grinr
nell College campus. "Let's
Make a Deal" offers a package to
females in the event that they are
or become pregnant. Is Mr. Kent
hoping to prevent the occurrence
of abortion by making light of
this serious subject?

The ﬁrst four points of the
six point package are amusing
and predictable, considering Mr.
Kent‘s conservatism. Points ﬁve
and six, however, are not amus-
ing. but demeaning to women.

In point live Mr. Kent of-
fers "in every way possible to

conceal" the pregnancy from any
woman's parents, relatives and
friends. Many women look to
family and/or friends for support
in situations in which they are
not capable of resolving a prob
lem alone. They would not nec—
essarily feel compelled to conceal
the pregnancy.

Mr. Kent’s sixth point is
the most insulting. Assuming
that the woman carries out her
nine month term for Mr. Kent,
he will reward her with a sum of
$500. At that rate, between Nov.
18 and Aug. 18, a pregnant
woman would receive just over
13 cents per hour for her time.

This ‘gcnerous’ offer is followed
by the self-righteous statement,
"Life is more precious than any
amount of money," yet Mr, Kent
denies the pregnant woman's life
any value other than that of a
baby factoryt Is the abonion of
fetuses more immoral than the
disregard for other members of
the existing moral community? I
think not.

If Mr. Kent is serious, his
proposal is an outrage, My body
is not for sale; it is not even for
rent. if offered in jest, its only
humor is his assumption that the
women of Grinnell would come
to him, Anne Vt Ne|son

Offers "deal" to Kent

To the Editor:

This week, as usual, we
opened the Scarlet and Black to
Mike Kent’s column, only to
scream, "What a butthcadil" and
shred the entire paper, This
frightened several small children,
we're afraid. Let the blame lie on
Mr. Kent's shoulders,

Let it be resolved that on
this day, the eighteenth of
November, nineteen eighty-eight,
Beth Wodzinski and Jillian Kong
present this binding offer to Mike
Kent.

In the event that any future

column you write surpasses the
condescending, patronizing, of»
fcnsive,
phalloegoelhnotheologocenuic
and just plain stupid column you
wrote for the Nov. ll issue of
the Scarlet and Black. we offer
these concessions:

1. $5.00, as a token of our
esteemt it's not easy to offend us
as much as you have, and we be-
lieve that your efforts should be
recognized. This sum may go
down as ability to pay decreases
due to the feminization of

poverty. (If you don‘t know what
that is, look it up.)

2. We will provide you a
tutor for every lesson in the
realities of life that you missed
while you were enjoying your
"loving' and caring family,
carefully screened and fully
capable" of raising their son to be
ignorant and reactionary.

3. A lifetime supply of the
"contraceptive vaccine," because
some people simply should not
reproduce. Beth Wodzinski,
Jilliaii Kong

Questions why S & B prints Kent's column

To the Editor:

This letter is not directed
toward any opinion which Mike
Kent holds, 1 do not respect his
opinions enough to take him se-
riously as a thinking being.

Sorry Mike, you didn't piss
me off, you're too boring, The
reason that I am bored by Mike
Kent is the reason I am writing.

I am beginning to have
about as much respect for the
Scarlet and Black as I have for
Mike Kent, which is non-exis-

tant, for printing the trash he
writes. I am under the assump-
tion that, although this is not
always apparent, the S and B
would like to be considered a le-
gitimate newspaper. If this as-
sumption is correct, why does the
S and B staff feel that every year
a column must exist written by a
generic white, male freshman
which holds as its goal being to
"piss people off," Call him Paul
Draus, Mike Kent, or any other
name, this column is very

unprofessional, I do not profess
to know anything about joumal-
ism, but common sense tells me
that the goal of an editorial
should be to bring to light an
important issue and possibly
provide a reason to discuss the
said issue, not to "piss people
off." If I want to get pissed off, I
will watch Morton Downy, Jr.
Remember, even the Weekly
World New: fired Ed Anger.

Kudos to crew
of Waltz

To the Editor:

I would just like to express
my thanks to Student Coordinav
tor Dagmar Grimlund, her assis-
tant Cindy Jones, and all their
little elves for doing such a good
job on the Waltz. Tile decorar
tions were magnificent, and the
new sound system allowed
everyone to actually keep on the
beat. Everyone I've talked to says
they had a fun time, and I don't
know how they will top it in the
