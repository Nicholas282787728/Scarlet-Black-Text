On the Schneid

It started as a simple grudge
match. In 1966, the NFL wanted to
prove to the football world that it
played ioolball ol 3 higher caliber
than the upstart AFL. In January
ol the following year, the Football
Championship between the two
leagues was played, and it created
about as much excitement in the
sporting world as the National
Championship ol Lawn Bowling,
For the first two years of the Series
the NFL proved its point, as the
Green Bay Packers demolished
the Kansas City Chiefs and the
Oakland Raiders. After two years
the NFL felt that the game was a
waste oi time and that the yearly
clash of the league titans should be
canceled. Then came Joe Namath
wlth his self-predicted AFL vic-
tory, and the rest was [ootball
history, Sports ians around the
country began to pay attention to
this ioolbnll game. The Champion-

ships grew to become the Super
Bowl, the greatest sporting specV
tacle oi the year. Now the grudge
match has become a sports-
ontertainment event oi epic pma
portions.

Besides Easter Sunday, Super
Bowl Sunday has become the most
revered Sunday on me calendar.
More people will watch the Super
Bowl than have voted in the last
two Presidential elections combins
ed. There will be more members ol
the media covering the event than
the lasl two graduating classes ol
Grinnell College. And the in-
satiable sports appetite oi the na»
tion will gobble up every morsel oi
the Super Bowl gibberish. By the
end oi this week, more Americans
will be able to describe the Denver
Broncos’ deiense policies than the
policies ol any ol the Presidential
candidates. More people will read

Victories both in Darby and on
enemy hardwood by the Grinnell
women's basketball team
highlighted the irigid months oi
December and January lor the
Pioneers.

The First Win of the season was
recorded in Fayette: Iowa, and the
team did it right, Alter displaying
new heights oi poise and teamwork
in edging ahead 32731 at inlermis
slon, the Pioneers continued
operating at this level until livc
minutes remained in the contest.
Then they hit overdrive. Execution
was nearly ilawless as the team
crushed Upper lowa leZ in these
last minutes, posting a 6352 big v.
Grinnell nearly had a quartet oi
doubleligure scorers in their best
oiiensive display oi the season.
Laura VanSiCkle. who “tickled"
the twine ior 30 points, Shannon
Carr and Elizabeth Mchmsey, had
12 each, d Amy Johnson just
missed J rig the group, as she
scored a. Mchmsey snared 13 re»
bounds and VanSickle grabbed a
dozen during the fray. /

The team returned to Darby
three days later. and the new level
oi play they had lound at Fayette
stayed with them for the first
three-quarters oi the game against

a tenacious Iull~courl press thrown
at them by the Buena Vista
Beavers Although the Beavers are
probably the equal oi any team in
the Midwest Conlcrence. Grinnell
was hanging tough at 4337 with l2
minutes to go. However, the tight
scbrc had caused Grinnell to be
irugal with their substitutions, and
lntigue reared its ugly head in this
noble cllort, Most oi the Pioneers'
whopping 38 turnovers Came in
these last dozen minutes as the
Darby throngs hopes turned to
despair with nv. pulling away at
the end ol their 67-53 triumph. The
Pioneers oularebounded their ioes
by 18 with Vansickle and Mo
.limsey grabbing 13 while Carr had
10. VanSickle again led the scoring
with 24.

The "Oh-no,-herescomes-finals"
slump so prevalent in Grinnell
hoop teams hit the women in their
last two outings oi fall semester in
losses to Cornell (76753) and Wart-
burg (6744i, VanSickle led the
team in points and rebounds with
51 points and 23 boards. MCJimsey
also thrived in her role oi l»2 re-
bounding punch. being credited lor
17 in two games.

The women returned to campus
on Jan. 9 in time to catch a couple
ol weeks oi comlort in the north

The earlysseason frustration fac~
ed by the Pioneer men‘s basketball
team continued throughout the
Christmas vacation as they drop
ped all six of their games and saw
their season record fall to 1-12. As
usual, they were competitive in
most ol the games, but crucial
lapses proved costly. The rash of
injuries also continued, and to date
may have not had the entire team
healthy ior any oi the thirteen
games,

On January 5, the pioneers
traveled to Wartburg and fell 80-66,
after trailing by just live at the
half. Warlburg increased their
deiensivs pressure alter the in-
terim. flustering the Grinnell ol-
fensive attack, while their inside
scoring, led by Mike Murphy's 29,
provided the bulk of the margin.
Freshman guard Holland Neal
paced the Pioneers with 16 points
in only 22 minutes.

Grinnell's conference Season
opened on January 8 at Cornell.

The score was deadlocked at 23 at'
the hall, but the Rams pulled away
midway through the second hall
ior a sass decision. Cornell's free-’
throw shooting kept the Pioneers
at bay, as the home team hit 22 oi
so compared to the visitor’s iour oi
ii. Two freshmen again led the
Grinnell scoring attack as B..l.
John had 15 and George Mchmsey
hit ior lo.

The lollowing day saw the
Pioneers host a poweriul Mons
mouth team at Darby Gym. Grin~
nell was leading alter in minutes,
2cm, but the delending Conference
ceschampions pulled out to a
15-point halltime lead en route to a
92-64 thrashing, Monmouth’s Brant
Carius had 25 points and an ima
pressive 19 rebounds, while Terry
Chapko and Mchmsey led Grinnell
with 14 and 13, respectively.

The Pioneers traveled to Cedar
Rapids on the lsth to lace Coe in
what proved to be the most ex-
citing game oi the break. After a

MY
Way

by Joe Lewis

The fresh scent of brine sum-
mons the visitors as crashing
waves hurl themselves to the shore
in a irenzy, Powdery white sand
blows gently across the beach, The
torrent of the surging tide is a sym»
phony to the ears. intriguing is the
dance oi sea gulls, as a young child
throws bread crumbs to the air.
Ahead, a soft towel and pillow
beckon, offering the promise ol
total relaxation, Eventually, the
mind surrenders to the call of a
deep sleep, as the sun gently
envelops the body with warmth
and Contentment.

“HEY GUYS, lT,‘S TIME TO
GO TO PRACTICE!” The scene
changes.

A crowd ol beaten men gather
together at the end of a swimming
pool. With heads hanging low, they
listen intently as the impending
doom is spelled out. The cold ligure
looming above reads from his tome
oi demise. A sadistic smile creeps
onto his face, as he reminds the
assembly to “have fun with itl"
Reactions are various. Some laces
twist in pain at the thought or what
lies ahead, while others remain
lifeless, numb from the countless
hours of repetitive sulfering. Here
and there a voice cries out in
anguish, but most remain silent,
accepting their fate with submisV
sion. Soon the process is under
way. Clusters quickly become
lines, as the Cruel hand of the clock
forces each individual to confront
the nightmare that lies ahead,
Fighting near physical exhaustion
and an assortment of indescribable
emotions, the men press forward,
length alter length, practice alter
practice. day alter day. With no
end in Sight.

Such is the life of the Gl'lnnell
College swimmer over winter
break, The beauty of Florida's
beaches contrasts immensely with
grueling workouts that hauntingly
reappear twice a day A a truly a
bittersweet experience.
