Mary "Be" James cross dressing games:
A fashion show, music and a good cause

by Bill Warburton

The air was humid and hot in
Gardner Saturday night, and there
were transvestites everywhere.
The men strutted around in tacky
and sometimes revealing dresses.
The women were mustache: and
suspenders and talked with low
husky tones. One female stuffed
her pants with enough socks to
make John Holmes envious. The
Grinnell students spared no effort
in their quest to emerge
Victorious in The Mary "Be"
James Cross-Dressing Games
Fashion Show

The Church Lady was there as
MC, and she kept the tightly
packed crowd of sweaty
transvestites in good humor with
her timely quips.

"Is that a pickle in your
pocket or are you just happy to
see me?I" she remarked at sight
of the "well-endowed" woman
aforementioned.

Hordes of Grinnellians waited
in line to show their stuff
Turning, twisting, teasing, and
bending, the contestants strived
to exhibit their most ﬂattering
features.

Karen, dressed like a 86 man,
was judged by the crowd to be the
best female crossrdresser. Andre,
the plump and matronly woman,
won in the male category. After
words, they danced a very sweet
and moving slow dance.

Darby Gymnastum was deco-
rated beautifully. The multitude
of streamers and balloons were
reminiscent of a high school
prom. NABs and munchies were
provided. The Band E.l.E.l.O.
played a brand of Country Rock -
- more rock than country »- and
kept the people entertained and
dancing. Some reactions to this
cross-dressing evening were as
follows:

"I feel like a natural woman,"
remarked Chris Mullarky.

"When my boobs went down
to my waist, I regretted not
wearing a bra," said Todd Smith.

"I'm hoping to meet a trucker
with a big, hairy chest," chlted
Howard Gardos.

Students made the following
comments about the band:
"They sound good but they're
a little loud," said Vince Bechtel.

"It was good to dance to. I
give it a ten," whispered a
hesitant female who refused to
give her name.

"They sound really good butl

The band was good, die fashr
ion show was fun, and it was all
for a good cause. All of the pro-
ceeds from the [shirt sales are
going to The Limit, a teenage
non-alcoholic dance club in town.
Jefff Fields, the HAC for James
Hall, said that the legal responsi—
bilities or having a party with
alcohol were too great. Without
the necessity of making proﬁts
for the purchase of alcohol, the
hall was able to donate the shirt
money to charity.

The Limit was opened two
years ago, and is a gathering
place for high school students on
Saturday nights from 9 pm. to
12 am. The facility has an area
for dancing and for showing
movies. There are also two pool
tables, but balls and cues are

three high school coordinators of
The Limit, says that they want to
make the dance club a hang-out
that attracts all of the high school
students, Hopefully, James
Hall's contribution will support
their efforts.

Culture changes shock
student studying in China

by Mai-lee Chai

A cockroach the size of a
small field mouse struggles in
the folds of the mosquito net
before my window. It climbs
deeper and deeper into the
labyrinth, following one false
path after another. dangling there
as the early morning light
beckons through the haze.

Studying in Nanjing, China
this semester, I feel at times as
lost and confused as this
cockroach. It is impossible to
prepare to study in China, I have
discovered. History classes,
language, literature, books about
the Cultural Revolution and
economic reforms... they are not
enough. Even a visit to Nanjing
in 1985 has not cushioned my
sense of bewilderment. So much
has changed so quickly,

In 1985 watermelon stands
lined almost every street. Today,
stands selling ice cream sand-
wiches and cones prevail by far.
In I985, by dressing in my
baggy navy-blue pants, flat
"gong fu" shoes and untucked
blouse, I could blend in and
escape into the sidewalk crowds.
Today Nanjing women wear
bright-colored blouses, mini-
skirts, thigh~high stockings or
Sheer knee-highs, and colorful,
plastic, high—heeled shoes. The
only women who dress like me
are the peasants, hawking grapes
and apples on the street.

The extent of my bad taste is
reﬂected in the prices at the de—
partment stores. The flat black
shoes I favor sell for 4 yuan, the
heels for about 25 yuan. I am
obviously out of sync with the
times and my idiosyncrasies
brand me a foreigner, And thus
there is no escape from the sense
of strangeness I feel.

As too much exposed ﬂesh
might elicit stares, the Clee pro-
gram pamphlets advised against
wearing shorts and tank tops.
Ha! Nowadays it seems women
exposing their thighs is in
vogue. Flesh is definitely "in."
Most little shops post outside
their doors titillating photos of

customers inside?) Cassette tapes

Walking down the street, my
friends and I have heard whistles
and catcalls. Couples not only
hold hands in public -- a big deal
in 1985 -- but some even neck in
the open!

I expected the sounds of spit—
ting and bicycle bells and eicada.
l was unprepared for catcalls and
the ineluctable "Hello! Change
money, change money?" that
bombards every foreigner.

Many Chinese are willing to give
about 1.3 yuan of People's
money for every I yuan of

access to buy things. This
practice of ”changing money" is
illegal.)

I do not know what to think
of this new China. Do I like
seeing a country whose culture
has fascinated me embrace with
wild abandon Western trappings?
