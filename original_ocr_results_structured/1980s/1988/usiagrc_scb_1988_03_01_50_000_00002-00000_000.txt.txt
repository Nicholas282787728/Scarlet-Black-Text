As a person who has been
involved with runny diﬂ'ercnt
groups, causes, concerns, and
problems, i lraye worked hard
for results. These accomplish-
rrrerrts have included secrrrirrg
a commitment from the col.
lege library for the pnl’cllass
irrg of books on black concerns;
obtaining funds froru one of
the trustees to support the he
narrcial obligations of the calls
cerued Black Students organi-
zation; and working actively in
conjunction with professors to
frrrrd the establishment of an
Afro-American studies chair. As
President 1 hope to gain results
for the campus at large, just as l
have in these specifrc instances.

Two pervasive campus prob»
lerus arc money. or lack thereor,
and student apathy. licre are a
few ideas about lrow i will allevi-
ate these problems a. sea pres-
ident. sen tends to run out of
money, particularly during the
spring semester. Approaching
the administration and trustees
for extra money is futile since
their funds are fully allocated.
During my presidency. SGA will
use more creative means to
raise money, utrliriug sources
that have been neglected, The
administration and faculty can
also beneﬁt from rrrore creative
techniques in garnering atlcli~
tiorral funds.

There is a great deal or cons
frrsiorr throughout the campus
as to how to obtain SGA frrrrds
as well as how SGA operates
in general. This leads to apas
tiry and a feeling arrrorrg cams
prrs groups that they are dis
tanced froru SGA. and that they
lraye little say in the role tliztl
SGA plays in their activites. As
SGA president l rntend to have
c rupns groups take a rrrore ac-
tryc role in campus wide decision
making.

i believe i have the strength
and the resolve to make changes
for the good of all students
From my past experiences, i
have learncd the (]|l3lltll\ \vliiclv

of an issue and discern the
best solution lo a situation
When you consider a candidate,
please think of what someone
has achieved. not what poﬁltlons
and titles they have lluld,

One may bicker about which
candidate has the biggest feet,
but there is little arguenrerrt
that Ali ElSnﬂ'ar's shoes are
hard to ﬁll when it corrres down
to tiuding someone to succeed
him to the vice-Presidency.

As a candidate for that of-
tice, i do not pledge to ﬁll Ali‘s
shoes, so to speak. 1 do. how.
ever, propose to afford the posi.
tion with the rrrost effective, or
gauired and representative lead
erslrip that my experience can
provide.

For the past three years I have
worked with SGA ill variety of
capacities: as a senator, as the
Chair of the Student Building
Committee, on the Faculty Rene
ovation Committee {or ARH, as
an active EPC representative
on Student Curriculum ('0un~
cil, and as a Studenl Adviser.
That I have been involved in all
these areas is a reflrction of the
love that I have for my work,
born out or lnv concern to sec
that things are done, and done
well, to address the needs of
the strrderrt body, The working
knowledge and familiarity that i
have from successfully (‘01\|||I\|-
niceting and cooperating with
students, facility, Student Air
fairs. and the Administration,
allows rrre perspective and in-
sight which few have been for.
tunate enough to have and bring
with them to an other of Student
Government.

1 wish to pursue my commit-
ment to the student body and
Grinncll (‘ollge us a whole. in
the allies ofVice-l’rcsideni, that
I may bring my skills to hear
on such issues as this 3:). core
cnrricrrlrrrrr, continuing to lmr
prove campus academic and so
cinl facilities, and lHOc’IdE‘lllllg
channels of communication lit»
tuceu stutlcuts. student orgar'
nations and their representatives
ill SGA. The key in all of those
issues is the collilnunicniion of
informotrorr and ideas between
students, faculty and zdniillis
trariou. Ollly byworkiugclosrty
with students, their EPC‘s and
Curriculum Council can we its»
surc tlltll with the irrrplcmeu-
tation of the student le-
crrriremerrts are net and prob
lems are resolved, Only through
similar means can we evaluntc
our rdeas and our goalc, so that
it is u-rtlr forcsigirt and plan
ning that we assert whether or
not core curriculum rs a pro.
gram of wrlne for our college.
lt is only through cons rrt
cxtrnrrnation of thc e . dry of

existing clrannels ofcommunica-
tiorr and the creation of entirely
new ones, that consistent, poss
itiye exchange of tlrorrghts and
information can occur between
Student Government and the
multifarious groups that corri-
prise our college. it is neces-
sary not only to meet the day
to day challenges that present
themselves to us, brrt to address
potential problems before they
arise, rather than after the fact,
which is so often the case. it
is my utmost goal to help shape
and develop a more represents»
tive and informed Student Gov-
ernment which better serves the
needs of the student body and
works to achieve those goals set
for it by those it represents.
