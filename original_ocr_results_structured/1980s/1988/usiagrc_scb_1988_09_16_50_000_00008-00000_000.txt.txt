Soccer team captures Grinnell.
Invitiational to go 2-0 for season

by Bob Lifton

You couldn't have painted a
better picture. A doubleheader
swcep to open the season is al-
ways nice, but something seems
extra special about these
victories. Despite being
hampered by all sorts of injuries,
and for the most part being
dominated offensively, the
Pioneers somehow managed to
shut out St. Olaf 2-0 and pull out
a Zrl overtime win over
Gustavus Adolphus to capture the
Grinnell Invitational Tournament
for the second consecutive year.
But hey, it's not how you play
the game, it's whether you win or
lose.

So, how did tltey do it?
How'd they manage to see their
way through the myriad of
bumps, bruises, lacerations, and
whatever other ailments you want
to lump in, to perserve not one.
but two victories against such
formidable opponents as these
Minnesota powerhouses?

Coach Pfitsch has his own
theory: "The good Lord was
sitting on my left shoulder. We
played well, but we were also
very lucky." That really about
sums it up. Hustle,
determination, solid defense, and,
ah, a little luck of the Irish
Sounds fair to me.

The Pioneers' first test came
Friday afternoon against the
highly touted Olies from St,
Olaf -- they came into the
tournament boasting an
impressive preseason national
ranking of ten in the West. (Ya,
sure, they're talented and all, but
who was Saint Olaf. and what the
hell's an "Olie7") While they
were sufficiently dominated at
times by the tall blondes from up
North, the Pioneers did all the
scoring, emerging with not only
a victory, but important
recognition as well.

From the amount of times
the Olies took a shot on goal
(they outshot Grinnell 2372), one
would have expected them to

have scored -- at least once Nah
ah. If they weren‘t being tendered
off by co-captain (goalie) Randy
Seeley. their shots were sailing
high or wide of the goal, So
much for logical mesoning.

The two squads couldn't get
anything going in the ﬁrst half,
balding each other to a scoreless
tie. After halftime, though, the
Pioneers got the ball down in
SLOlaf‘s territory and capitalized
on the situation.

As in the alumni game. the
Pioneers worked their "Brazil"
play to a tee. Mark Saint Andre
launched a comer kick, on which
Austin simmons played decoy,
leaving KJ, Noll to knock it i
According to Noll, "We took ad-
vantage of the opportunities we
had, and then iced the game on
sheer determination.“

It wasn't soon after that they
indeed had a lock on the game.
The Olies were apparently
crushed by the play, the goal
breaking their back and draining
all their energy.

Within about four minutes of
Noll's goal (which incidently
proved to be the game winner),
the Pioneers struck again Tom
McCollen hit a through»ball to
Simmons, who was subsequently
tripped up inside the box.

hitting a squibber into the vacated
left side to give the Pioneers a 2»
0 lead.

And this was how it ended.
Grinnell tightened up its defense

 

to perserve the shutout, sending
the Olies back up north to ponder
how they managed to come up
empty. Sorry, ch.

The Pioneers dragged their
beat-up bodies to the early game
on saturday against Gustavus
Adolphus. Wherever you looked,
it seemed someone was nursing
an injury: Noll's thigh,
Simmon's leg, (cmapmin) Brad
Bisgard's ankle. Layne Maly's
chest, and Ian Lonnier not even
suitting up due to a bad knee,
just to name a few. And not to
feel left out, freshman Erich
Giebelhaus came into saturday's
contest sporting a new dental
wear, thanks to a mid-air
collision the previous afternoon.
And they call it a "non-contact"
sport.

This was one hell of a game.
From the looks of it, it appeared
that the Pioneers would blow this
team out of the watert Grinnell
was much faster and seemingly
more talented. They just couldn't
capitalize on most of their
chances.

Still, the Pioneers did
dominate the first half, scoring
the only goali .lohn Master came
all the way from his sweeper
position to put the Poineers up
1-0. Master jumped all over a
loose ball outside the 18, and
after a brief collision with the
goalie, smacked it into the left
comer. Pure hustle.

The second half was a
different story, with G.A.
spending a good portion of the
time on Grinnell‘s side of the
field. But unlike their neighbors
from Minnesota, they put the

Bumbled two-point conversion
leaves Pioneers just shy

by Gordon Schreiber and Eric
Dahlin

Grinnell's football team came
up three points shy of giving
coach Greg Wallace a debut vic-
tory as head coach. Nevertheless,
Saturday‘s 29-27 loss against
Concordia of St. Paul, Min-
ncsota suggests that Grinnell‘s
onec~struggling football program
is on the right track. Says Wale
lace, "You will always be disap-
pointed when you lose a game
that you have a chance to win.
but I was very encouraged by
what I saw. We moved the ball
very well all day and played solid
defense." Wallace was especially
pleased with the confidence and
determination displayed by the
Pioneers, whose ﬁght back from
a 2944 deficit included a scoring
drive in the final two minutes of
the game. ,

Although Concordia scored
29 points, the defense, ted by ju-
niors Mike Ander n d Bill
Dabney, played very ell, limit-‘
ing the Comets to 163 total
yards Field position, however,
hun the Pioneers, as two touch~
downs were scored after Concor-
dia took possession of the ball
inside Grinnell's 10 yard line.

offensively, the Pioneers
dominated amassing 336 total
yards, but they had a difficult
time holding onto the bail. tum-
ing it over six times Senior
Paul Manternach had an
outstanding afternoon, rushing
for 157 yards on 33 carries and
scoring all four of. Grinnell's
touchdowns. Senior quarterback
Jim Weiand also enjoyed success
toting the ball. picking up 78
yards on 8 carries in the option
oriented attack. Much of the
rushing success can be attributed
to the play of the offensive line
led by Scott Whipple and Paul
Schneider, who demonstrated a
great deal of leadership,

Coach Wallace believes that
his team can be competitive. but
that it must cut down on mis-
takes. He also stresses that in

   

order to be successful, the ofe
fense, defense and special teams
must play as a single unit with
the common goal ofwinning. If
the Pioneers can keep from beat—
ing themselves, this team could
be in for a successful and excite
ing season.

Grinnell is idle this weekend
as they prepare for their home
opener against Iowa Weslyan on
