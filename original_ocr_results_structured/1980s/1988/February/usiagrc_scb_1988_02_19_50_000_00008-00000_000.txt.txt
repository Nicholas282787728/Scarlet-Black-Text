Rashomon

by Matthew c. Macho

Akira Kuro, iwa, director of the
classic "Seven Samurai." is un-
questionably Japan's most iamous
filmmaker His film “Rashomon,”
made in 1950. took the world by
storm. winning the grand prize at
the Venice Film Festival and
catapulting Japanese iilm. as well
as Kurosawa himself. to worldwide
recognition.

The brilliant screenplay is
adapted irom two short stories by
Ryunosoke Akutagawa and takes
place in feudal Japan. The plot
revolves around several men talk
ing about a brutal crime (sups
posedly. a nobleman was
murdered and his wife raped by a
bandit 7 a truly villainous
character played by the great
Toshiro Miiunel. The film is me
teresting in that it presents the
same story in several diiierent
ways: the bandit claims he
defeated the nobleman in a fair
duel. the nobleman tthrough a
spirit medium) claims he was
murdered. the wife declares that
she killed her husband in a fit of
lunacy. Which version is true? One
of the men discussmg the crime
adds to the uncertainty by telling
yet another version, attacking the
participants' accounts as selfe
serving and egotistical.

Although it would be a mistake to
View "Rashornon" as a vast
metaphysical statement about
truth, it is a film which poses some
interesting questions while
withholding apodictic answers it
is an enjoyable, orginal iilm. with
provocative acting, excellent
photography, a superb ilow oi im-
agery, and excellent music.
Dialogue is in»Japanese with
English subtitles.

Valley Girl

by Vincent Presser

This 19m movie is a charming,
winning depiction of a modern
young woman's dilemma, Should
she continue to go out with the lug
she doesn' t particularly like just
because he's everyone else's
dreamboat, or should she follow
her own conscwnce?

While this movie could have lent
itseli to cheap exploitation, it does
not. ii i recall, a iriend oi the pro-
tagonist does at one point bare her
breasts But it’s not at all
titillating, (The nonrtitillating ac~
tress also played Pee Wee Her-
man’s chubby bicycle-shop
sweetheart in “Pee Wee's Big
Adventure"; here, she is a little
more earthy), Directed by a
woman director and independently
produced, the film finds realistic
situations and portrays them well.

Chan is Missing

by May-lee Chat

“Chan is Missing" is a
delightiul, iunny tour into the
Chinese-American community
that became the surprise sleeper
hit oi 1932. Ostensibly, it is a detec-
tive story. A San Francisco
Chinese-American cahby and his
nephew search ior their missing
”friend" Chan Hung, who has
mysteriously disappeared with
$4000 oi their savings. However,
the cabby is no Charlie Chan
stereotype. Living up to its title (in
more ways than onel, this iilm
serves to debunk the old
stereotypes as it takes the viewer
on a whirlwind tour of Chinese-
American culture.

When I saw the announcement
for the opening of "Ellsworth Keir
ly: A Print Retrospective." i
thought of the Kelly exercise
assigned by Robert McKibbin in
my introductory drawing course,
The exercise was to observe the
outlines oi a plant and to capture,
without tone or texture. its
silhouette, My experience in at
tempting to realize Kelly's
graceful style of contourrline draw»
ings and my anticipation of the 31.,
tist's presence at the opening lured
me to the Des Moines Art Center,

An exhibit or photographs by
Henri Cartier-Brawn is the first
work seen upon entering the main
gallery, The black-and-white
photographs portray the people at
lndia. France, China, Germany,
and the United State . I felt touch-
ed by Cartier-Bressnn's poignant
images, but moved on in search or
Ellsworth Kelly. I entered the new
Wing of the art center in the hope of
iinding the 65~yearrold American
artist there however, I was disapr

he was unable to attend the exhibit,

proved to be another way oi
meeting him. Kelly's improvement

about his later work: “None oi my

A live»yearrold gazing at the pic-
tures may just see a big. red, very
round circle. But to Kelly‘s older
admirers, his work is more than
just brightly colored shapes. The
intensity oi primary colors in the
prints in the museum's West Room
