Special Edition will

Include Endorsements

The Scarlet and Black will publish a special edition this Tuesday, dealing with the
Student Government Association presidential and vicepresidential elections. In this
special issue will be it the statements at intent tor all the official candidates; 2)
texts at interviews with all M the candidates, conducted by the editor-in-chiet; 3)
candidate endorsement by the Scarlet and Black editorial stall.

Interviews will be conducted Saturday and Sunday, with the approval at the in-
dividual candidates. ll any candidate does not wish to be interviewed, the Scarlet
and Black will still publish that candidate's statement. Each candidate will he ask-
ed the same set or questions as his or her opponents. However, an additional three
questions, dealing with the individual’s experiencn or plans, will also be asked. The
questions lor the interviews will be drawn up with the assistance ol SGA President
Lil Johnson and Vice President Ali ElSaltar.

The editorial staff ol the paper, which consists ol the editor-in-chiel, news editor,
leatures editor, arts editor, and sports editors, will review the tapes til the inter-
views and come to a decision as to who we feel are the most promising candidates.
This decision will not be limited to one person per position as in most nevnpaper
endorsements. It the staff IeeIs that two or more candidates Ior either oftice are
equal in their potential, then the Scarlet and Blacll will suggest both or all at them.

There are two primary reasons why we are undertaking this endeavor. One is that
this Itind oI action is what a newspaper is intended tor. Our purpose is to inIorm the
public to the best at our abilities. In giving you the statements at intent and texts til
the interviews, we will serve that purpose. Campus elections olten mirror national
elections in that signiﬁcant issues are not dealt with. It is our opinion that by locus-
ing on the election we will bring those issues to the Iorelront at these campaigns.

The second reason we are tailing this action is to aid the student body in
decipheri and evaluating what the candidates are saying. In the past, there have
been occasions when what candidates said they would do and what they actually
could do were very difterent. There are many things that students would like to see
done on this campus which, because ol the lack ot delined student input in those
areas, are not within the abilities of the SEA president or vicepresident to carry out.
This is where our endorsements come into play. We leel that we can help students
to evaluate the potential ol the candidates so that the nmpus is not deceived by
any unrealistic promises.

The endorsements which we will print will not be traditional ‘vnte Ior person A
and person Ii‘ endorsements. We view them more as suggestions. Our goal is tor you
to read the statements, then the interviews, then our endorsements, and decide Ior
yourself. it would be even better, though, it you did not stop there. Go to the open
lorums and tallr to the candidates. There are a lot oI ways to get inIormation on
which to base your vote - use them.

Reader Responds to
Student’s Comments

To the Editor

1 am writing in response to the
"Homophobia Remains Reality"
article in February 5th's Scarlet

and Black. Speciticaliy, l am
responding to the comments made
by Meg Litls on Christianity and
homosexuality, As a Christian. and
one who does not believe that
homosexuality is 3 sm, i was or
(ended by her authoritative
statements and seemingly non-
iudgmentul attitude.

First oi all, by using the article
"the" in tronl or “Christian point
or view," Ms. Litts is contusing her
personal batters with “the cruise
tian point or View," which is non-
existent in our world. it any
number ot Christians were to be
gathered in one room (a really big
room) and asked what "the Chris-
tian point or View" is on any
number or subjects, there would be
many disagreements among the
answers. Views would be coming
trom all directions. 1 do not think
that Meg Litts, or any other per”
son, has the authority to proclaim
what is or is not the Christian View,
One's faith is a personal and the
tegral part or the individual

Ms. thts likewise seems to use a
rather loose dclinltion ot the word
“Judge." i looked up the word
"judge" in a dictionary and tound
many deﬁnitions. such as “to
determine," “to decide." and “to
term an opinion of.“ The dic-
tinnary also provided synonyms
llke “referee” and “arbitrator"
tpeople who are known tor deter
mining right trom wrong and tar
making decisions based on study).
Proclaiming something a sin, to
my knowledge, is calling it wrong

or bad. giving it negative connotar
lions. It is deciding that it is not the
right way to act. I agree with Meg
insbtar as believing that one.
especially one claiming to be a
Christian, should not sit in judg
ment of others But isn't calling son
meone a sinner. determining or
"believing" someone is a sinner,
judging them'!

Ms Litts has determined, or
Judged, homosexuals as sinners tor
herseit and, by her initial state
ment, for all Christians

In trying to discover it Ms. Litts
had support tor claiming the Chris
llan view that homosexuality is a
sin, I looked through the Bible,
both the Revrsed Standard Version
and the New English Bible, with
the help at a concordance and V P.
Furnish's book, “The Moral
Teachings of Paul; Selected
lssues " I lound passages that
could be used as evidence for her
position. However, these same
passages and others can be used as
a support tor opposing stances. i
will attempt to argue my position
with these passages.

First of all, I would like to make
it clear that nowhere in the Bible.
in the original Hebrew. Greek, or
Aramaic, can the word “homosex-
ual" be lound. One place in the Bic
ble where people who share Meg's
view find their support [or
homosexuality as a Sin is in the
book or Genesis, specifically in
chapters 18 and 19. Brieﬂy. what
happens in the story is this God
hears at the wickedness of the men
at Sodom and therefore sends
angels, disguised as men. to Sodom
to test the men. Lot enlreats the

angels to stay with him under his
protection. and they agree. The
men at Sodom go to Lot's house
and shout to Lot to let the Visitors
but so they may have intercourse
wtth them. Lot reluses their re-
quest and otters his two yll-gln
daughters instead. God's decision
is to destroy Sodom and its people
by turning it to brlmstone, but Lot
and his family are allowed to
escape.

One way to interpret this story is
to conclude that God's anger is
sparked by men desiring to have
intercourse with other men l am
not claiming that this interpreta
tion is either wrong or right;
rather, T suggest it is one of manv
possible interpretations. I would
like to olfer an alternative View,
(My view is well-backed by the
arguments Furnish sets torth.r

I believe that the real abomina-
tion or wickedness that is objected
to in the Genesis lit-19 story is the
lust and violence or the men It the
Sodomites had been allowed to
“know" the angels it would have
been a case of homosexual rape.
There are other reterences to
Sodom throughout the Bible, none
at which deal with the sin ol the
men. but rather with God's judg
ment and power. There are places
in the Bible that refer to homosex-
ual acts as abominations tLey.
18:227, but they are just some out
or a listof many abominations such
as adultery and other sexual
perversions, In some Bibles, “$er
ual preference' is used instead or
homosexual acts, The homosexualr
ty discussed in the Bible must be
