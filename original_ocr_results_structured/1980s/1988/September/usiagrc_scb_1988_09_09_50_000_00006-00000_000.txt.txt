Reader sees irony in
Bar advertisement

To the Editor:

Something caught my eye as
l was thumbing through the
Scarlet and Black the other day;
an ad for the Bar. It just seemed
somewhat ironic that an estab-
lishment that only a little over a
fourth of the Grinncll students
can legally patronize would put
an ad in the S and B. Needless to
say, many students have grown
accustomed to going to the Bar
without having to worry about
being asked for identiﬁcation as
to their age when they ordered
beer or drinks. But ever since
student have returned to Grinnell,
many have complained about be-
ing "carded" and not being served
alchohol. Campus rumor has it
that this situation has occurred
because of the new police chief

who is coming down on underage
persons being served, So what
exactly does this ad say to the
rest of us who are under 21 7
"Please come to the Bar, so we
can turn you away?" It just
doesn‘t go. Is this is a signal
that the carding will stop'.7

Quite tactfully, the ad adverr
tises Bar caps; something we can
all buy while it merely alludes to
their “other underprict'd products,“
What products, Coca Cola 7
This whole thing may strike you
as trivial and stupid, but I am
rather humored by the whole
thing. I guess we, who are under
age, are all supposed to rush
down to the Bar to buy caps so at
least we look like we drink theret

—Letter Policy— Students respond to Davis'

Letters to the editor are a very important aspect of our

bad experience at BCC

To the editor:

This letter is in response to
an opinion expressed in last
week‘s Scarlet and Black, and to
some general conceptions sur-
rounding the Black Cultural
Center. First, although we do
not wish to apologize for Mr,
Davis' experience on that fateful
Saturday night (Aug. 27, 1988),
we do want to articulate our con-
cern for his feelings and eventual
response to the evening. Saturr
day night was an isolated issue.
not unlike many incidents that
can occur to Grinnell students at
off campus parties, when students
feel out of place. Black students
in particular have encountered
alienating environments during
on~campus and off-campus
events. However. we refuse to

jump to sweeping generalizar
tions. We continue to be optiv
mistic and attend all Grinnell
events with the hope and
expectation that any negative in-
cidents are indeed isolated, and do
not reflect the tone of Grinnell
College. There are no excuses to
be "conjured" for Mr. Davis' un-
fortunate experience; there is no
reason for an excuse. As mem-
bers of a college community,
students must learn to accept in-
dividuality, which, by deﬁnition.
involves differing opinions.
Therefore, occurences with indi‘
viduals and their respective opin-
ions should not form the basis
for conceptions of whole groups.

Secondly, misperceptions are
based on ignorance alone, It»is

our responsibility. as Grinnell
students, to exterminate these
forms of idle prejudice._ This can
only happen through openr
minded interaction between indi-
viduals and the realization that

one or two people (or ten people)
do not represent an entire consor-
tium of people.

This letter is more than a
simple rmction to cenain com-
ments; it is a request that stu-
dents actively seek the Lruth and
discard the fallacies that are
prevalent in any "uncomfonable"
situation. David P. White

Work-Study program compromises safety

To the editor:

Another semester has started
at Grinnell, and there has been a
scramble as people try to line—up
jobs for the semester. In the re-
cent past (the last two semesters).
assigning weight room monitor
jobs was a simple process with
not an exorbitant number of peo-
ple wanting jobs. This year,
there were at least three times as
many people at the monitor as
signment meeting, so obviously
not everyone could get a job. in
the past, athletesrinrseason and
people with previous monitor
experience were given job prefer-
cncc. This year, because of a
new school policy, people on the
Work—Study program were given
priority,

I have no problem with the
fact that Work-Study people are
given priority in getting on-cam»
pus jobs, as they are getting ft»
nancial aid and this is part of the
aid program. What concerns me
is in the area of weight room
monitors. Being a weigllt room
monitor is not a difﬁcult job, but
it does require two things:
knowledge of proper free-weight
spotting techniques, and strength.
What has happened this year is
that people who meet neither of
these requirements have been
given jobs before people meeting
both requirements.

There are jobs on campus
where Work-Study people are not
given preference, such as the User
Consultant jobs from computer
services. The reason for this is
because UC‘s are interviewed be-
fore thcy are hired to insure that
thcy all have a basic computer
knowlcdgc before they are trained,
It would be unfair to hire com-
puter-illiterate WorkrStudy pcor
plc before cxpcricnccd User Con-
sultants. This same sort of
treatment should be used in IIir-
ing weight room monitors.

In the past the monitors have

 

been given no training, but this
year the monitors will be required
to have first-aid training. This
will add to the safety in case
someone is injured, but what
about prevention? What fright-
ens me as a frequent user of the
weight room, is that some of the
monitors do not know how to
prevent the injuries, They don't
know how to spot correctly, or if

they do, will not be strong
enough to actually help the per
son they are spotting.

I have nothing against people
on the Work~Study program, but
school policy not only allowing,
but requiring that safely be come
promised to give those people
jobs is frighteningRon Haeger
