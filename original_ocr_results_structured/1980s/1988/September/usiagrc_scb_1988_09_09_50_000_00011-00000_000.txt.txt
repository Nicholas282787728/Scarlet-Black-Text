Scarlet and Black

Cross country gears up
for promising season

.y George Mctimsey
As the simmering Iowa
ummer begins to boil away, the
, ert and women of the Grinnell
ollege Cross Country teams
ave taken to the roads and the
001 Autumn air. For most of
em however. Autumn training
igniﬁes only the beginning of
e ﬁnal step (forgive the pun) en
ute to top-notch seasons. The
ork these runners have put in
ver the summer preceded these
that preparations for the opening
-f the cross-country season. And
hat a season it is shaping up to

The men return this year as
efending conference champions,
position they have now hold for
we consecutive seasons. Nine
f the top ten runners retum from
ast season and are joined by what
oach Will Freeman refers to as
'the best group of freshmen
t e‘ve had in years." Coach Free—
, an has also outlined a training
.rogram which he predicts will
ave his men running at peak
- rformance at the conference

"We're not going to

ys, "but rather focus on pro-
essive training. Trying to peak
unners at a specific time is air
ays a craprshoot but if we fol-
ow this program and stay
. calthy we ought to be up there
t the end.“ With the talent on

For the women, Coach Evcr

mores. These younger runners
help comprise a group which,
according to coach Freeman, "Is a
much better learn than last year.
A more complete one." What is
particularly exciting for the coach

is the condition her runners are in
now, after the summer. "This
year, as a group, nlnners have put
in more mileage over the summer
than in previous years. We're not
so far down the road and are thus
able to start the season at a
higher level." Running at a
higher level will likely translate
to placing at higher levels
throughout the season. "It is ex-
citing to anticipate how well we
can do," Coach Freeman says.
"our potential is tremendous."

Having recently returned from
a scmester in Canada, working
with some of the best athletes in
the world, coaches Will and Eve-
lyn Freeman have returned to
Grinncll to coach two of the best
teams in the conference. The
heat will be on Pioneer oppo-
nents as the men and women
open their seasons at Auguslana
and Cornell respectively. The
runners are dcdicalcd, well-pre-
pared and, in the words of coach
E. Freeman, "The prospects look
tremendous for all."

in a 9.5 on his goal. which made
it 3-nil in favor of the young-
stersr It was a straightaway shot
which he pumped ill from around
the 18. It would have scored in
any game.

In the second half (or is it
two-thirds?) the old folks did
manage a goal of their own, as
Shane was shielded from the
play. But, oh, did he have his
sweet revenge

They call it the "Brazil" play:
a guy pumps the corner kick
right at a teammate -- say, on the
near post-- who has the option of
either letting it go (decoy), or
ﬂicking the ball to another in-
coming teammate who bangs it it
the
whole. On this day, the honor of
being the incoming man be
longed to none other than our
boy Shane, running all the way
(yes. some goalies actually do
nln) from his goal into the op-
posing teams' penalty box. (For
all of you who can vividly pic-
ture this scenario in your minds,
you're Well aware that this leave's
one goal unguarded. But don't
fret. our defense is nice and
solid). In any event, the play
worked to perfection, as K].
Noll tipped the comer to Shane,
who promptly vollied it past the
bewildered goalie. And hence,
the birth of a star (a little Coscll
Jargon there, sorry).

Said the exhubcrartt 'Tuna'.
"It was awesome! I’ve been dye
mg to do that for a long, long
time. I've been practtctng it durr
ing sct‘images; I‘m glad it finally
worked.“ Gotta like it. Kinda
like a pitcher smakin' a three-run
dinger .. pinch hitting. Yea,
kinda.

In actuality, Shane's goal
wasn't that unexpected. Coach
Pfitsch gave him the rare oppor-
tunity to play the field in the first
half. Knowing that this chance
may never come around again.
Shane strutted his offensive stuff
(not the stereotypical, clumsy
ballrhandling skills oflcn associr
aled with goalies. like, say,
"Forearm“ Soeley). We observers
on the sideline knew that it was
only a matter of time before the
kid from Delaware got to feel the
exhileration of scoring.

In the "extra half," the offense

 

resumed the scoring responsibili-
ties. Noll popped a header into
the upper right corner off a sweet
cross from Fairchild for the ﬁfth
goall Soon thereafter, Fairchild
was on the receiving end, this
time a beautiful pass from Sim»
monds, pushing it past the over-
worked goalie for the ﬁnal goal
of the afternoon. And that‘s how
it ended: current stars 6, senior
citizens 1.

It was kinda like a prize ﬁght
which went too long. But that's
alright, it was all in good fun -»
right guys? It pays to be young.

"a big help" because she is capa-
blc of playing at the top of the
ladder.

Captain Apryl Henry is ex
cited about the addition of the
talented freshmen, saying "their
talent helps the team tn two
ways, they will wtn malChCS,
plus they make others on the
team play better."

The Pioneers look forward to
defeating William Penn in their
first match of the season, on
Wednesday, September 14 at 4:00
at home. Come out and show
