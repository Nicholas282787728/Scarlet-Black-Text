"Lost" endowment
to benefit SGA

by Dave Jones

An endowment for the Grinnell
College Student Government
Association set up seven years
ago is now approaching the
$20,000 mark. The Student
Government Association, whose
present cabinet only recently
became aware of the fund, will
receive about a $3000 boost to
its fall budget from interest off
the fund

Rob Killion, SGA vice
president, was informed about the
endowment over the summer by
Marcia Koester of the Grinnell
College Development office.
Koestcr pointed out to Killion
that checks for the interest off the
fund for had not been picked up
for the last two years.

The interest off the endowment
was supposed to be picked up by
the SGA treasurer at the end of
each school year. The last check
that was picked up was at the end
of the 1984-85 term. According
to Killion, the reason the last
two checks have gone uncollcctcd
is the SGA treasurers did not
know that the fund existed.
"Since the check was supposed to

 

be picked up, and no one knew
about it, it just never got done."
said Killion.

Profits from Phonathon

The endowment began as a
windfall from the college's
annual phonathons. During the
'81-'82 school year the
Development ofﬁce agreed to put
all of the money raised in the
phonathons by the previous three
classes into an endowment for
student social activities. In
return, SGA would provide help
with the phonathons. For the
following five years the same
thing was done. At the end of
each year, the interest off the
endowment was put into SGA‘S
general accounL

The arrangement between SGA
and the Development office no

longer exists.

While SGA still receives the
interest off the fund, there is no
exchange of money for
assistance. Killion, however.
said that an agreement is being
worked on that would have SGA
help with the phonathons in
return for money placed in the
endowment
