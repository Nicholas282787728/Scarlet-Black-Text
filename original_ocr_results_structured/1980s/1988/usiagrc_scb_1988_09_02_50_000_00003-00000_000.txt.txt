Lesbian Gay Alliance (GLGA).
There are several reasons for the
name change. One reason is that
many people didn’t feel that the
word "gay" included women, and it
was feltthat lesbians were alienated
by the name. While the current
name specifically mentions only
gays and lesbians, GLGA welcomes
people of all sexual preferences.
Another reason for the change is
that the word “alliance” better re-
flects GLGA’s political nature than
the old word
“community” did.
However, GLGA is “a diverse
group reﬂecting diverse goals and
interests," said Matt Macho.
GLGA plans to set up support
‘ groups for those who are not
interested in the political
a side of the or anization.
GLG has many
goals for this year. One
of these goals is to

services. both in town and on cum<
pus. Several students have report~
edly had had experiences at the
Mental Health Center in town.
OLGA would also like to have an
onrcampus counselor, who would
fill a role similar to that of the Mi-
nority Affairs counselor.

Another project, which has al-
ready been startcd, is a network of
gay and lesbian alumni, who would
be able to give support to Grinnell
students, as well as ask for support.
Machoalso mentionedpossible fune
draismg opportunities through this
network, which would give GLGA
some independence from the hassles
ofcollege funding. “Fundratsing is
sheer hell," said Macho.

Fred Morris said that he would
like to see more emphasis on gay
and lesbian history and literature in
classes at Grinnell, possrbly even a
course. “Gays and lesbians have
been pretty much ignored," he
stated,“like how women and blacks
are ignored. Now professors are
starting to make women and blacks
part of their courses: we’d like to
see the same thing happen with
gays and lesbians.”

Macho spoke of starting a gay
journal. for which he has already
begun collecting material. Macho
spoke of the importance or” chroni-
cling current events, since “this is
the first time in history that gays

look back on thisyouma] as a record
of this.“

On a broader scule,Grinnel1 will
be hosting events at Rock Creek on
October 15 for National Coming
Out Day. Todd Shepenl said that
Grinnell was chosen because it is “a
ruralcommunity. Alotofthepeople
who will be coming are from rural
areas. Confidentiality is guaran-
teed, which is easier in a rural area.
It’s also the firstday offall break, so
therewon'tbemanypeoplearound.”
National Coming Out Day com-
memorates last year’s march on
Washington. D.C., which 25 Grin-
nell College students attended.

The traditional meeting time of
GLGA is Thursday nights at 9:00,

in the Human/Gay Resource
Center. All are welcome.
