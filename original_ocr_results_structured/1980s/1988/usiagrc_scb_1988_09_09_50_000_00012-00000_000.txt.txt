The Pfitsch legacy:
He breeds winners

by Bob Lifton

He's been coaching forever.
Alright, we'll call it 40 years just
to be technical. And they have
been 40 very enjoyable years.
mind you. John Pfttsch not only
loves his job, but he's damn good
at it too. Just look at his finshed
products. He always seems to
guide his teams to superalative
records. As coach Pfitsch is
quick to point out, however. he's
not in it for the stats.

"I don't coach for the records.
I thoroughly enjoy the boys. I
really respect these kids."

His emphasis here (he almost
nods, as if trying to convince a
non—believer) is worth noting,
Those who have witnessed
Pfitsch's antics on the sideline are
apt to wince at this remark (if
you‘ve never been privy to the
coach in action, let's just say that
you would want to shield your
mother's ears from his often ﬂip-
pant comments). Surely it must
be a fascade. Not at all. His re
spect for his players is absolutely
genuine And if you ask any of
them, the feeling is mutual.
Sure, he has been known on oc-
casion to rant and lave at a player
or two, but that‘s just part of his
coaching philosophy. Coaches
aren't supposed to be best friends;
they're supposed to teach, which
happens to be Pfitsch's area of
expertise. And while you may
have qualms with his mode of
"teaching." you cannot argue
with his results.

Take a peek at his '88 soccer
learn. You will end up taking a
lengthy stare, l'll guarantee you
that. They're damn good, folks.
hands down.

"This team has the best natur
ral talent of any team I've had
here at Grinnell." That's no
statement to shrug your shoulders
at either. In his four decades of
coaching. Pﬁtsch estimates he‘s
coached about 100 teams, which
includes the basketball team he
look to nationals. "They are also
the fastest team I've ever

(Lorimer), (Brad) Bisgard,
(Randy) Seeley. they're all tough
players. If we don't do well,
provided that we don't suffer any
serious injuries. it's mostly our
fault"

The talented Pioneers will
deﬁnitely have their hands full,
though, as they have a very chal-
lenging schedule in front of
them. But that's the way the
coach wants it. He wants his
team to face quality opponents.
For Pfitsch, an undefeated or
three-loss cake walk of a season
looks good on paper, but it really
doesn't have much value.

This team will get a quick
dose of their strong competition
this weekend, as they open the
season against two Minnesota
schools: St. Olaf on Friday at
2:00 p.m., and Gustavus Aldolr
phus on Saturday at 10:00 am.
Minnesota is arguably the best
soccer conference in the Midwest.
so it will undoubtedly be a tough
battle. And if the Pioneers have
any hope of making nationals —-
they must be voted the best team
in their region of the country,
which includes Iowa, Wisconsin
and Minnesota -- they must do
well this weekend.

Did you say NATIONALS?
Isn't that stretching it a little?
Not at all. Not to put the dreaded
"Sports Illustrated Curse" on
them or anything. but if they can
beat St. Olaf (they lost last year
there, 2-0), which went to na-
tionals in ‘87, they have a good
shot at the big time. But first
things first.

Right now, coach Pfitsch's
only "goal" is to win the confer—
ence championship. The Pier
neers have bcen there seven out
of the last nine years but have
won only once. This could very
well prove to be the magic year.
After that? Who knows, maybe
nat»- ah, don't say ill

Well if they do reach that
coveted area of the select few (8
teams total: 4 from the East, 4
from the West), it will be a mix
ture of player talent and coaching
guidance.

"I'm often criticized for not
disciplining my kids enough
while they're out on the field.
But I want the kids to play the
game, not the coaches. I don’t

Tennis team
plays well at
pre-season
Tourney

by Laura Whitmore

Grinnell's women‘s tennis
team is gearing up for a success-
ful season on the courts. Last
week they participated in the
Iowa Fun Doubles, sponsored by
Luther College. Since Fun
Doubles do not count in ofﬁcial
standings, the Pioneers had a
chance to test their skills against
other teams without the pressures
of conference play. Overall the
team did well, with most doubles
teams winning at least one match
and holding their own in other
matches.

Coach Dee Fairchild expects
improvement on the team's con»
fcrcnce tanking in her second year
as coach. The Fun Doubles
showed Coach Fairchild, " a
much stronger learn, with several
good freshman joining the expe-
rienced juniors and seniors."

Challenge matches will con-
tinue for two or three weeks to
determine the rankings of the
players. Coach Fairchild is
pleased that she has eight players
who are capable of playing vttrr
sity. Seniors Apryl Henry, Eliz-
abeth Werner, Lisa Jepsen, Julie
Nagila, and junior Erica Smith
are joincd by freshman Heather
Radach, lennic Wang, and Eliza-
beth Banftcld vying for the top
six spots on the ladder. Coach
Fairchild cites Heather Radach as

Alumni no match for kids

Show 'em how it's done "Tuna"

by Bob Lifton

Too bad they all won't be that
easy. Too bad the rest of the Fir
oneer men's soccer team's oppo-
nents can't be the caliber of the
alumni whom they manhandled
671 last Saturday. If they were,
the Pioneers would undoubtedly
get a cover story in "Sports
Illustrated" as the top team in the
land. There's fantasy, and there's
good ‘ol reality. But that doesn‘t
stop us from basking in the fun-
ﬁlled moment, now does it?

The multitude of out-of-
shape, over-zealous alums are
now safe and sound in their re-
spective homes across the nation.
but the memory of Labor Day
weekend and just how much you
lose when you stop training for a
sport, will linger in their minds
forever. Unless they're runners at
the Board of Trade, the closest
most of them have come to any
significant form of exercise is
watching it on LV. with a beer
in hand. Who ever would have
thought that corporate America
would be safer than Grinnell
College?

This was definitely one
strange soccer game. (No, not
the fact that the Pioneers were
victorious. They are a very tale
ented team which has the poten»
tial to win conference.) "Strange"
simply by virtue of the duration:
one and a half games. No, not
the normal 40 minute match, or
even a full—ﬂedged doubleheader
for that matter; rather. one and a
mighty half. The alumni came
with such a large band of players
(once they received their coveted

‘u...

diplomas, they forgot th
signiﬁcance of the age-old adag
"quality not quantity") that they
could afford another half of pun-
ishment. OK, so they're sadis
