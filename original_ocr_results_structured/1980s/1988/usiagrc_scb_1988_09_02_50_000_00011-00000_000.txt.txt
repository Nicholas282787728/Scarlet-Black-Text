Landscape in Iowa:

by Virginia A. Meyers,
Professor of Printmaking, School
of Art and Art History,
University of Iowa. Through
September 28th in the Print and
Drawing Study Room, lower
level of Burling Library. Open
Sunday through Friday 1:00 -
5:00, closed Saturdays. The title
of the show, while adequate, does
not fully convey the nature of the
works. The images are not the
static images the title leads you
to expect. Rather than trying to
capture the appearance of the
lowa landscape, Meyers attempts
to communicate the experience of
the landscape and explore the
intangible dimensions of human
experience. Exhibit . opens
today, September 2nd, with a
Gallery Talk and Reception
tor the artist, at 4:15.

Emophilia to hit Grinnell

by Dave Jones

1 have to admit at the outset
of this that I have never seen
Emo Phillips perform in my en-
tire tile. Luckily that is not a
prerequisite for writing for this
newspaper, even when the subject
of the article is Emo Phillips.

Emo took time out of his
hectic schedule to phone us frotn
a Chicago suburb the other night
to grant us an exclusive interview
(that is, no other campus news-
paper got tliat chance). He gave
us an opportunity to pick his
brain, and be disgusted by the
what we found: pure mush.

As I said, i have never seen
Emo perform. but he'll be hard-
presscd to top his performance on
the phone the other night. With
his voice set to midrpubcrty,
Emo discussed his life with the
warped sense of direction that
luckily took him right past
Grinnell on his last vrsit to the
area,
"I drove through Grinnell on
the way to Denver...lt was very
nice. i was also there once be-
fore, m part of a sensory depriva-
tion exercise. It turned out real
good."

Emo also offered a preview of
what Grinnellians can expect
frotn him when he stumbles into
Darby Gym at 9 p. m, tonight.
"A heck of a lot of my jokes

Benjamin Disreli's role in the
emergence of lrislt independence
in the latter halfof the nineteenth
century."

After getting responses like
that to relatively serious ques
tions, it seemed inevitable that 1
would continue to set Etno up for
oncrlincrs, so I did my best to
help him.

Q, A few years ago,
Michael Jackson was sued for
paternity. Have you had
any similar experiences itl
your life?

,ﬂm.,...w.,.mw.,wM.N.ﬂwm./.,a.ﬁ.mwm.ﬂw,

BACK ALLEY DELI

A. We never sued
Michael Jackson for paternity,
although George Michael has
yet to get back to me.

Q, Do you have any
groupies that travel around
with you?

A. I have a couple
groupies in each city. I call
them Emophiliacs.

With Emo’s bi7arre antics.
poetry, riddles and the Sufi Dance
of God, Grinnell may be hit with
an epidemic of Emophilia.
