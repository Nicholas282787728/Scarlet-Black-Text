by Beth Wodzinski

On Wednesday, Nov. 9, the
Human Resource Center will
present an exhibition trial by the
Grinnell College Mock Trial
team. The event will take place
in Main Lounge from 7 to 9
p.m.

The Mock Trial team was
founded by Devani Scheidler,
who participated in her high
school's mock trial team, Schei-
dler, planning on a career in law.
says that mock trial “builds con-

ﬁdence and helps you analyze
things in a new way, a better
way."

Wednesday's trial centers
around date rape, an issue which
has been given a great deal of at»
tention on campus lately. In the
scenario, Brad Paulus, played by
Manish Aeharya, is charged with
raping Jessica Nelson, played by
Karen Lehman, Additional wit-
nesses are Jen Deaderick, Pctc
Simon. Jon Wentzel and Beth

Wodzinski. The attorneys for the
defense will be Scheidler, Chris
Gunst and Walt Junker, and the
attorneys for the prosecution will

and Rashmi Dyal-Chand.

Next semester Scheidler
plans to take two teams of Six
attorneys each to a competition at
Drake University in Des Moines.

Student tells of
rural life program

by Jennifer Watson

~, Last year, Cindy Rybolt
spent a month living with Robert
and Helen Reneaud and their son
Brent on their beef farm. Rybolt
was one or two students to
participate in the newly created
Grinnell College Rural Life Pro-
gram, The program, started by
Diane Dougherty and Dick Jenk-
ins, is designed to give students a
taste of farm life.

Rybolt is from a rural
community herself. She
thought, "It would be nice to live
on a farm for awhile. I was in«
terestcd in farm culture and I'd
never lived with another family."
She did very little farm work be-
cause she found she didn't have
the necessary skills, but she did
have the chance to watch Mrs.
Reneaud kill a turkey. Rybolt
has kept in touch with the Re-
neauds and occasionally has din-
ner with them. On one of these
visits last spring, during calving
season, she helped put eartags on
the calves.

Students participating in
the program live with a Grinnell
farm family for one month:
Students eat meals with the fam-

Cult of Advil here at Grinnell and

their membership is growing.
Esdms VP estimates that there are
about 25 members. As astute
mathematicians will notice, 25 is
5 X 5. The most important
thing to remember, says Pope

is a Pope). is that there are no

prevails.

ily. Though no farm work is re-
quircd, they have the opportunity
to go to farm auction and do such
things as help to take care of
livestock. The students decide
how involvcd they will be in the
activities of the farm. but,
according to the sponsors of the
program, it should be a place
where they spend some time.

The idea for the Rural Life
Program was formed when Jenk-
ins, a consultant for the Devel-
opemem Office, was talking with
some alumni. They discussed
providing the opportunity for
Grinnell students from urban ar-
eas to experience Iowan farm life.
Jenkins contacted some farm
families and gave the idea to Tom
Marshall at Student Affairs who
then found sponsors for the pro-
gram. Dougheny, assistant dean
of Student Affairs, offered the
program to students and last year
two women participated,

The Grinnell College Rural
Life Program is being offered
again this year. Interested stu~
dents should contact the Ofﬁce of
Student Affairs.
