that it is otten associated with the
labels of "racist” and “sexist"
when the anonymous anti-gay
signs were being posted last year,
knee-jerk suspicion was aimed at
“North Campus jocks.” specifical-
ly football players).

The fact is, athletes make up a
substantial proportion of the
population of the college, probably
more numerous than any ag-
gregate one might care to identity,
Their pursuits are no less noble
than the ones of those involved in
theater «save those who plan to
make a career of it), or organizes
tions such as SCA arid the folk
dancers. All are groups which exist
for the enjoyment and accomplish-
ment of their participants, and all
should be regarded with equal
respect, if not enthusiasm.

Yet this has obviously not been
the case, We currently have a foot-
ball program in an incredible state
or disarray, and we have yet to
hear of any definite efforts to hire a
new coach, In order for Grinnell to
be able to field a team next year,
there will have to be a significant
number oi incoming treshmen who
are interested in playing, it is,
honever. unlikely that too many
prospectives will be enthusiastic
about playing for a coachiess team
coming oil a Hi season. So instead
we'll abandon the tootball pro-
gram. letting what is one of our
finest athletic facilities go to
waste. Sound absurd" It has only
begun.

The preferred sports at Grinnell
college are swimming and men's
soccer. The logical response to this
might be that. because these are
our most successful teams. they
should be rewarded with the most
benefits But is it not true that the
professed "spirit” of Grinnell
athletics lies in competition and
participation? Instead of using the
successes of the above programs
as an example to uplift the quality
of our other teams, the gap or
preiorcntial treatment has been
widened, causing teelings of
animosity to grow between par-
ticipants of various sports.

A case in point occurred last
weekend, when the men's baskets
hall team made a three-day, eight-
hoursboth~ways trip to Wisconsin
in a van and a station wagon, while
the swimmers took the inﬁnitely
more spacious “leisure van" on a
twoehour trek to Cedar Rapids, The
basketball players were not in-

' formed of their considerably
cramped and unlit travel condi~
tions until their arrival at the PEC.
That way, you see, there is little or
no time to hitch.

This is the sort of frustration that
has faced the basketball teams all
year. They each have new and
potentially successful coaches.
which at lace value appears to be
an attempt to improve But their
hirings have become little more
than token gestures due to unkept
promises and sudden changes in
plans, incidents which have left
both teams with an “us-against
the-world" attitude, This apparent
policy of paying the dues before
singing the blues belongs in the
dark ages. You can’t build a sues
cessiul program of any kind it you
are shunned by the rest oi the
organization.

this carnage was only attecting the
big people in the scarletsandrblack
jackets. another kind of injustice
arose, this time altecting the
recreational athlete, During
break, the administration decided
to construct a new computer office
in Darby Gym. Within a week of
the decision, the building began,
again leaving those inconvenienCs
ed by the move with no time to pro-
test the action. The cement wall of
the office runs literally adjacent to
the end line of one of the courts us.

the second floor of the office hangs
several feet over the Court.

Basketball is the most popular
sport in a terrifically successful in-
tramural program. The participa
tion is such that We have a special
interest league as Well as the stan-
dard dorm competition, All the ad-
ministration had to do was cons

ample space on the outside of Dar-
by (any rationalization lrom this
miserly institution that such a pro
cedure would be too expensive is
otfensive and unacceptable). The
games will most likely be played
there after some pads are put up,
but it might be wise for any par
ticipants to see if their insurance
covers reconstructive surgery.

preliminary phone call also,

Many people fail to understand
that it is possible to have a suc~
cesslul athletic program without
corruption Though Michael Galae
ty’s‘letter in last week's issue was
excellently put, 1 would dispute the
accusation that our conference
foes are bending or breaking the
rules. Because of their lower ads
mission standards. they are likely
to attract more athletes, and they
definitely enroll more Iowans, who
have excellent high-school athletic
programs if we show a commit
ment to building our sports pro-
gram. then the athletes who have
already been admitted as students
will be more likely to attend Grin-
nell.

But change is not likely to come
without pressure and organization
If an issue as Crucial as racism has
had barely a whisper or activity
from the administration since the
Speakeasy or three months ago.
then the lesser problem ol’ athletic
success will be slow going

interestingly. or should I say
ironically, enough, President
Drake has been elected to chair the
NCAA Divisionelll subcommittee
There is currently a proposal
before the committee to establish a
scholarship which would be given
to athletes on the basis of leader
ship, not necessarily on need (the
criterion by which all monetary
grants are currently awarded).
Mr. Drake should support such a
proposal, thus exemplifying the
realization that in fact leaders
come not only tron-i the orator's
podium or the scholars desk, but
also from the athletic field.

{or you." >

“How's that?"

"If you don't shape up, things
are gonna be really bad."

This was a shocker for me, as I
try to live cleanly. and stay away
from bad habits. I eat three fruits
and vegetables per day, drink lots
of water. stay away from greasy
foods, go light on red meat and ex
ercise regularly. i don’t drink,
evcn carbonated beverages. why
was i in such big trouble?

“You really should start thinking
about the WORD of the LORD." he
told me.

This cleared things up rather
quickly. My acquaintance went on
to explain that it i did not accept
Jesus Christ as my personal savior
that I would be relegated to that
part of the afterlife playground
reserved ior beaeaeaeaed boys.

“What about the Chinese?" I
asked him “They are a billion peo
ple. Almost none of them have ever
heard of him "

"You worry about yourself,
leave the Chinese to their own pron
blems. ‘

It shocked me that such an in-
telligent. "educated" man could
hold beliefs that to me were so
basic and simplistic He really
didn't care if a quarter ofthe World
was damned unnecessarily. But he
did care about me. and that was
the most important issue at the
time. He really thought that l was
in eternal peril.

We went on to discuss the impor-
tance of the Bible in his life, and
the codes of behavior that it
outlines, After an hour or so It had
become fairly late. and we were
both tired. so we said our good
nights and went our separate
ways.

The first thought’ which came to
my mind afterwards was. "How
self»righteous!" It seemed to me
incredibly arrogant for someone to
assume that merely because of a
leap of faith he would become one
of the privileged few who would be
chosen for admission to an en-
joyable afterlife. it seemed
ludicrous to me that merely by
saying a few words and memoriZs
ing a few lessons he would be per-
mitted entrance to the kingdom of
heaven. ”I am a Sinner! Jesus
Christ is my only hope‘ i am evil.
Lord help me! " then wlioosh! Ins~
tant salvation Pretty neat trick. I
thought. ‘Isn't religion a personal
thin . l asked myselt "Is it
necessary for all oi your peers to

know how much you've sinned?"

“Maybe there‘s a committee
that decides on admission," I
responded. “The more people who
know how devout you are, the bet-
ter your chances of salvation."

But this answer just wasn't sati5~
tying. it struck me that the kind of
people that cling to this opiate
must really be missing something.
Not only does it make them feel
better about themselves, it gives
them a springboard of moral
superiority “Sure. i don't feel as
good about myself as you do, but
after this lifetime, boy, are you
gonna get clobbered!”

I let these ideas roll around in the
bowling alley otmy mind for a lew
days. and started to have second
thoughts.

Wasn’t i just casting fundamen-
talists into the little box called
"zealot” and forgetting about
them as people? Wasn't i trashing
the argument because of its propo-
nelit'? Weren't they advocating the
same sort of values that i attemp»
ted to follow in my own life?
Wasn't l judging them as they had
judged me?

At this point it occurred to me
that the fellow that had spoken to
me a few nights earlier had NO
IDEA what my religious bellel's
were. He knew only that i was not
part of his club on campus. and
that I did not attend a fundamens
talist church in town. That was all
the information that he needed to
pronounce sentence on him:
fanatic. It also seemed that I would
be equally wrong in doing so.

i guess the‘reason that i am so
skeptical about the faith of these
people is because their whole
“morality" is based on sells
interest: I will follow God's law
because if I do, he will reward me,
and it I don‘t he will allow me to
suffer eternally This is morality
based on fear; i will not have pre
marital sex because I will be
punished if i do.

I have far more faith in the
morals of people who struggle in
tcrnally over their beliefs instead
of accepting the whole package on
blind Ialth. ’I Will not kill because
I feel killing is wrong” seems far
more moral than, ”I will not kill
because the Book says not to. and
If I do What the Book says not to I
Will be punished " Morality based
on fear loses all foundation as soon
as the reason for fear is taken
away,’it a fundamentalist loses
faith in the Book, on the outside
chance that this will ever haooen,

With all the recent scandals in
Washington and the character
issues in the campaign, honesty
and sincerity in a candidate are a
must. Governor Dukakls runs a
clean campaign; he does not ac»
cept PAC money, and he says that
he is running against the other can

didates only for the office and for
bids his staii and volunteers to be
negative or accusatory toward
other candidates. in 25 years in
government there has never been a
scandal. The Democratic party
needs effective leadership that can
win. Michael Dukakis is the man for
the job.

the basis tor maintaining his or her
code of behavior vanishes.

0n the other hand, the person
whose morality is based on a code
worked out painstakingly over
many years cannot be undermined
by the absence of any book or set of
written rules. i donot mean to imp
ly that a “holy" scripture should
not be used in determining a set of
values and morals, far from it. i
think that the primary function of
religion has been to indoctrinate
people into a code oi mores and
values which are conducive to a
stable, cohesive society. Religious
writings have served millions of
people extraordinarily well in
determining the morals and values
that they accept as their own.

i guess I'm just uptight because
these people are so convmcnn
that their beliefs are absolutely
correct. They are reaching out to
me because they genuinely fear tor
my eternal soul.

Sometimes i indulge myself and
assume that l have been blind all
along, that they have been right,
"How could so large a group of
people deceive themselves for so
long?" i ask myself, taking their
stance, People thought that the
world was [lat tor a long,'long
time.

i asked one fundamentalist if he
had always known about the Word.
and he replied that it wasn't quite
this way.

"I used to question everything,"
he said to me. "But i realize now
that i knew (about God and his
Word) all along, even though it
wasn‘t clear on the surface."

This puzzled me initially. and
continues to do so. it you don't
know somthing, how can you know
it in spite of yourself? Maybe i just
don't realize that I DO understand
this conundrum .,

The other thing that really irks
me is that lundamentalists draw a
distinction between a loving. kind.
compassionate person who does
not believe in their doctrines or
God. and a loving. kind, compasA
sionate person who does: the
former is as damned as the worst
sinner. while the latter has a suite
on reserve at the Hotel St peter.
what is the difference? Why is one
a good person and the other noti

What it all boils down to is that
these people do not extend to peo-
ple of all religions the same
respect and esteem that they
would like to be accorded. For this
I cannot go along with them.
